<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>O time can wear out the memory
of those favours which I have recei∣ved
from your hands; You were of
the first that gave me a visit, when
few durst adventure themselves un∣der
the same roof, being by the good providence
of God, necessitated to leave a place sorely af∣flicted
with the Pestilence; and labouring under
a Feaver, wherewith presently on my departure
God pleased to afflict me: and were eye-witnes∣ses
of the mean accommodations, which in those
<PB REF="3"/>
straits could be provided for me and my reve∣rend
brother, with both our wives and families,
all cast upon the same condition at that time; &amp;
you made it appear that your eyes affected your
hearts, in giving a free invitation to me, and
those that had dependance upon me, to your
house, assoon as with security we durst adven∣ture
over any mans threshold, where for many
moneths we had free and liberal entertainment.
If <HI>Paul</HI> in an Epistle did remember the like from
<HI>Onesiphorus</HI> (with special observation, that he
was not ashamed of his chaine) my heart must
needs have checked me, if having opportunity
of Epistling according to received custom, you
should have been forgotten. <HI>I</HI> shall not be
ashamed of the language of beggers, if they have
learnt it from such a hand; <HI>The Lord grant unto
you, that ye may finde mercy from the Lord in that
day.</HI> In your house I had not only leisure to
make a good progresse in this Work, but singu∣lar
accommodation from your accomplisht Li∣brary.
So that you have not only a deserved
interest in the Author, but in the Work it self;
upon sight of one part, you have often called up∣on
me for publication of the whole. So that if
the Reader reap any benefit, he may see how
<PB REF="3"/>
large a share in the thanks is yours. I know you
affect not <HI>Panegyricks,</HI> neither am I fitted for
them, nor was ever accustomed to them. There
is much published to the world of one of you in
the life of your reverend Father, to whom I have
often in my thoughts applied that of Doctor
<HI>Hall</HI> concerning learned <HI>Whittaker; Who ever
saw him without reverence, or heard him without
wonder?</HI> Having led the Reader through his
glory, they adde: <HI>And yet his name with the
lively picture of his person lives, in his worthy
sonne, Master</HI> Samuel Hildersam; <HI>whose learning</HI>
Cambridge <HI>knew, when he was Fellow of Emmanu∣el
Colledge; and whose present Ministerial labours, and
pious conversation at West</HI>-Felton <HI>in</HI> Shropshire, <HI>do
perpetuate the honour of his Reverend Father; whose
memory he doth much reverence; and whose rich
vertues both personal and ministeriall he doth hap∣pily
imitate.</HI> And it is not little that is said
of the other, where it is remembred, that
<HI>you were propounded by him, for a meet wife
for his dearest sonne;</HI> and recorded <HI>that he was
heard with affection to ingeminate these words;
Never man had a kinder daughter in Law.</HI> To
be a follower of such a precident, and to be
found worthy of such a Testimony, is a great∣er
<PB REF="4"/>
glory, than all the noble blood that ran
through the veines of the greatest of either of
your Ancestors. Let this small piece finde a

already known to the Presse by his for∣mer
Labours, which do give so faire a
character of his worth, and bespeak of
thee so ready an entertainment of this
excellent piece, that were it not, that in this glut of
books wherewith the world is cloyed, it might be
unhappily buried out of thy sight; We neither need,
nor should prefix these few lines, <HI>tanquam digitum

it is conversant, is of noblest ranke; <HI>viz.</HI> The Covenant
of Almighty God with Man-kind, which is distinguisht
into its kindes; of <HI>Works,</HI> of <HI>Grace.</HI> And this againe,
according to the several formes or modes thereof, <HI>Old</HI>
and <HI>New,</HI> which how they respectively take hands
and agree, wherein they shake hands, and part. What
the terms of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> are, as propound∣ed
by God, and what the conditions on mans part,
whereupon he (being thereunto responsal) becomes
truely a consederate, what is the amplitude and com∣prehensivenesse
thereof in respect of the persons that
have right to claim to the priviledges or interests of
it, are all set forth in their various colours, and so
drawne to the life, that thy spirit is not like to be tired

with reading; but led on with an appetite so sharp
and quick, that when thou arrivest at the end, thou
wilt complaine of the shortnesse of the way. For in
the doctrine of the Covenant truly stated, an Ortho∣dox
Faith hath sure foundation; thence practick
godlinesse receives powerful influence and obligation.
Thereby very many errours of several sorts of <HI>Erro∣nists,</HI>
as by a teste or standard are rectified, or disco∣vered;
from thence our Sacraments do as it were re∣ceive
a soul, and those pertinent and seasonable digres∣sions
following in this book, concerning the necessity of
a settled Ministry, &amp;c. do by consequence receive both
strength and usefulnesse. As concerning the remains
of a former controversie about <HI>Paedobaptisme,</HI> which
are presented to thee in this Book, they are not out of
their own place in a Treatise of the Covenant. We shall
not adventure to say any more thereabout, but in imi∣tation
of that of Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> in the Preface to his
<HI>Ecclesiastical Politie,</HI> shall crave leave to re-minde
all agitatours of that or any other controversie. That
<HI>the time will come,</HI> when a few words delivered
with meeknesse of wisdome, shall afford them more
comfort, than great volumes written with scorneful∣nesse,

<HEAD>A Preface to the READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Eing by the good providence of God here∣tofore
engaged, in the vindication of se∣veral
truths, which were of concernment
to his Church, especially, the <HI>Birth-privi∣ledge
and Covenant-holinesse of the issue of
beleevers,</HI> I was unwilling to be silent, when
a spirit of opposition prevailed, lest the truth (for which I
had stood, and make it may glory ever to own) should suf∣fer.
In a designe of this nature, the greatest question with
me was how to proceed to the best advantage of truth▪ per∣sonal
conflicts are highly wearisome, and ungrateful, there
is much time spent with very little satisfaction to the Rea∣der,
even where most satisfaction is given to an adversarie
He must be followed in such paths that he goes, which of∣ten
are not very acceptable to the Reader to accompany.
And for the businesse in hand, <HI>viz.</HI> the vindication of a
beleevers faederall holynesse till the ground work be right
laid, and well understood, the superstructure in any such
dispute (managed in the most dextrous way that is conceiv∣able)
will scarce settle those that are weak, and not yet well
informed or established. I judged it therefore a way most
satisfactory, and of greatest and most probable hopes, for
the clearing, not only of this Controversie, but many more
now in agitation, to adventure upon a full Treatise of the
Covenant, which God hath entered with man, and the va∣rious
dispensations, and diversifications of it; whether such
as were occasioned by mans fall, or that God according to
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
his Sovereignty, by his just Prerogative hath been pleased
to order; where this is not in some measure clear, many
truths of great weight must needs lie obscure. Master <HI>Bax∣ters</HI>
words in his Preface to the Reader before his <HI>Apho∣rismes</HI>
of Justification are very remarkable: <HI>It is not in studies</HI>
(saith he) <HI>as it is in manifactures, that one man may begin
where another left; but every man must fetch it from the very
principles himself, neither can we take the words of those that
have studied it before us for that is neither a sound nor satisfa∣ctory
knowledge</HI> (quoting Mr. <HI>Pemble,) thence it comes to passe
that while we are busie in examining our fore fathers inventi∣ons,
and posterity imployed in trying our Examinations, neither
we nor they have much time to adde any thing for the encrease
of learned knowledge.</HI> Now the Covenant must needs be the
principle where we must begin to get knowledg of the seals
of the Covenant; This way therefore (resting on divine as∣sistance)
I have chosen, quickened to it as by the excellency
and great concernment of the subject, so also by the desires
of many that this thing in a just Treatise might be handled;
And when my thoughts were most full of it, and busiest a∣bout
it, and some preparations made for the work; the Sta∣tioner
by letter solicited, that I would enlarge my <HI>Birth-priviledge,</HI>
and sit it to these present times, and he would see
it published; Hereupon I went on in the work (a Scheme of
which follows here in an Analytical Table) in which I have
received help from many (as my slender furniture, and
strength with leasure to attend the perusal of them would
give leave) yet I have tied my self to follow none; I think
there is scarce any thing in which I am singular, I have so
much childish fear as scarce to dare to wall in publick where
I am alone, yet in several things I shall be found to dissent
from others, and those of eminent name with whom I
should blush to have any thoughts of comparison: There
are dissentings among those that are of highest repute. In
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
such case no inferior can agree with both parties, and there∣fore
it must not be deemed any piece of arrogance or singu∣larity,
to leave the one: where I am put to it to differ, the
Reader shall finde my reason, together with my opinoin. If
better light lead him another way, I shall never desire that
he shall go with me blindfold, or leave the truth to have me
his companion, yet least in leaving me, he should let go the
truth it self, I shall only request an unprejudiced and unby∣ass'd
judgement; If he bring a blood-shot eye, all will ap∣pear
of a wrong colour. It cannot be hoped but that wa∣ding
through so many particulars, I shall meet with oppo∣sition
frō some hands; I would only let such know first, that
I have made no man my adversary out of will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authours dissent from some. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> as desirous
to be a man of contentions. I sometimes close with my
greatest adversaries, and sometimes dissent from my most
honoured, and admired friends: I think I have as strong an
antipathy against quarrels, as <HI>Luthers</HI> against covetousness:
I only leave where that light that for present I enjoy, leads
me another way. 2. That I have wrote nothing but that
which as I beleeve, so I resolve (God assisti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g) to hold, till
a more clear light detect my errour. There are few things
that have vented, but many yeers have held my thoughts,
words or shews, will not work me out of them. 3. That I am
not yet so wedded to an opinion, but am ready to yeeld up
my self to be over-ruled by reason; He is the happiest man
that lies under the conquest of truth. 4. That no man shall
displease me that will deal argumentatively with me either
by the clear immediate testimony of Scripture, or argu∣ments
by just consequence derived from them; but in case
I shall meet with such dealing as I have found, to have my
words by enterchange made not mine, but the adversaries
own, my Arguments misrepresented, and held out to the
halves; I shal give those leave to hold up and pursue quarrels
with their own fancies. My years and employments, toge∣ther
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
with my weaknesses, will be a sufficient Apology to
hold me back from intermedling in such trifles. And for the
Reader that would read for satisfaction, I would acquaint
him,</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advertisemē<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to the Reader concerning the present work.</NOTE> that I have made it my businesse to cast the whole
mould and <HI>Series</HI> of the work; that he may find method and
order in it, &amp; if at any time through inadvertency or other∣wise,
he be at losse, and especially if he take not the whole
work before him (as I should desire) he may soone have re∣course
to the Analytical Table, and see in what order that
which in present his eye is upon, stands in the whole di∣scourse;
If he gaine no advantage by the method into which
it is cast, much paines and industry of mine is lost.</P>
<P>Scondly, That I have made it my studie to leave out
no piece or part, which may be fairly looked for within this
Verge, but have endeavoured to take the whole into con∣sideration,
studying to avoid two extreams, the one much
prejudicial to the Reader in Treatises of this nature, to
give us a bare skeleton of bones and sinewes, leaving their
Readers to clothe them with skin and flesh: These serve
better to help their memories that are already seen in the
subject, then to help those with satisfaction that are not al∣ready
verst in it, <HI>Memoriae mater ingenii noverca.</HI> I would
learned <HI>Amesius</HI> in his <HI>Medulla Theologiae, Cases of Conscience,</HI>
and other learned Works, had not, affecting brevity, herein
been defective. Sure I am, the Reader might well wish, that
learned <HI>Camero's</HI> work <HI>De triplici foedere</HI> had by his own
hand been more inlarged, &amp; that he had spoken more fully;
where his Reader may see cause justly to close with him, and
given in his Reasons especially in several differences (which
he assigns beteewn the Old (which he calls the subservi∣ent
Covenant) and the Covenant of Grace, where many
suppose they have cause to dissent from him. The other
extream might be the Readers benefit, but would have
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
been my burthen, and that is an enlarged full discourse on
every particular Divinity-head, that may occur in the hand∣ling
of this Subject, a way which reverend Master <HI>Ball</HI> in∣tended,
I have heard it from those that received it from
his own mouth, that his purpose was to speak on this Sub∣ject
of the Covenant, all that he had to say in all the whole
body of Divinity; a work that the whole Church might
wish (had not Divine providence determined otherwise)
that he had enjoyed life to finish. That which he hath
left behinde gives us a taste of it, and the advantage the
Church might have received by it. I have thought it e∣nough
to handle each particular, so as might well answer
expectation in reference to the present subject: To speak
of Christ as a Mediatour of the Covenant, and to set forth
the distinct parts of his work in such mediation without
handling the whole of the work, and all the Offices inci∣dent
to his Mediatorship: To speak of his death ratifying
the Covenant of grace, waving the controversie of the
extent of it, in the intention of God, or purpose of
Christ; It is sufficient to me to assert Faith to be a con∣dition
of the Covenant necessary to be put in by us to
attain the mercies in the Covenant, to speak of it so far
as is here concerned without a large Treatise of the nature,
requisites, and life of it; so I may say of godly sorrow, ces∣sation
from sin, sincerity of obedience, and the like.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Those particulars relating to this subject, which
are most controverted, and in this age disputed, I have spoke
to more at large; to instance in some. The conditions of
the Covenant of Grace, as well to the <HI>an sint?</HI> whether
there be any such conditions at all? which in our times by
several hands out of several Principles is denyed; Or the
<HI>Quae sint?</HI> what these conditions be? laying down rules and
helps for the better discovery of them. The supposed dif∣ferences
between the old and new, Whether such that of∣fer
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
injurie to the Covenant, under which the Fathers lived,
under <HI>Moses</HI> his administration, or before his dayes, ma∣king
it a meer carnal Covenant, consisting of temporal
promises, as the possession of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and pro∣tection
there, or at the least a mixt Covenant, and no pure
Gospel-Covenant, and the seals suitable? Or such that
put too great a limit to the Covenant in Gospel-times ve∣sting
it onely in the elect regenerate, excluding all profes∣sed
ones not yet regenerate, not onely from Covenant-mercies,
but all Covenant-terms, not admitting any to
stand in any relation to God, but those only whom his Spi∣rit
hath changed, making the call of God in the largest sense
convertible with Election, and the seal of Baptism to be of
no greater latitude (unlesse by mistake mis-applied) than the
seal of the Spirit, and determining it in the persons of the
elect (about which the meer congregational men and the
Antipoedobaptists agreeing in the former, do differ) that
they excluding the seed, and leaving them in the same con∣dition
(hope of education excepted) with the Heathens:
In these and some others, as the Reader may meet withall,
I have been more large, in such things where all agree, or
where it much skills not, whether we agree or differ (as in
what place, whether on earth, or heaven, man had enjoyed
immortality in case he had not sinned) what need we to ad∣minister
matter of contention, our work is to make up brea∣ches
(were it possible, so far as it may stand with truth) and
not to widen them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I have not so tied up my self to the expresse
immediate doctrine of the covenant, but that I have occa∣sionally
drawn Corollaries or Inferences leading to other
things of neer relation to, and necessary dependance upon
this of the Covenant; I shall not need to give instance,
the Reader all along will meet with them, such as I thought
would be useful, and to the judicious not ungrateful, some
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
of them practical, that the whole of the Book might not
be found to be Polemical, ayming at least at that which
the Poet so cries up—<HI>Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit u∣tile
d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lci.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, For that part in which <HI>Infant-Baptisme</HI> and its
grounds are particularly vindicated from <HI>Antipoedobaptists,</HI>
the Reader may see their arguments and corrupt glosses
are examined, onely as (according to my method laid
down) I have been necessitated, and so, that the Covenant
had not been vindicated according to my duty, in case that
had been neglected; And here those that please to heed
may see; First, the dependance that this Controversie about
<HI>Infant-Baptisme</HI> hath on the doctrine of the Covenant;
that a Scripture Covenant cannot be asserted, but Infant-Member-ship,
Infant-Baptisme in the latitude, as now ge∣nerally
used by Pastors in their Congregations, must be
upheld. Secondly, the order in which this controversie is
here carried, may so much the rather invite the Reader to
it, seeing what is in opposite Authors laid down scattering∣ly,
without regard to any head of doctrine in the Covenant
to which it doth relate, here it is reduced to its proper place,
and carried on in that manner as an orderly Treatise, and
not a personal conflict; following adversaries no farther
than as they stand in the way, to cloud the truth that is there
prosecuted▪ and though many advantages are hereby neg∣lected,
that might have been taken, which adversaries use
to prosecute to the uttermost, and these adversaries would
to the height have improved; yet I am very well pleased,
making it my businesse, that my Reader may not be trou∣bled,
but edified. Thirdly, the Scriptures that are pro∣duced,
and ordinarily agitated in this controversie of In∣fant-Baptism,
are not only urged, but a just Analysis of
the context opened, the full scope and drift laid down, so
that it may appeare that the words are not enforced, but
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
of themselves in their native strength commend that do∣ctrine
to us; that of <HI>Jerome, Apol. adversus Jovinian</HI> much
takes with me, <HI>Commentatoris officium est, non quod ipse velit,
sed quid sentiat ille quem interpretatur exponere; Alioqui si
contraria dixerit, non tam interpres erit quàm adversarius e∣jus
quem nititur explanare;</HI> And let the impartial and learn∣ed
judge whether somewhat more cleare light is not here
added to their full meaning and the adversaries▪ Sophismes
more cleerly detected. Fourthly. The least blow which Mr.
<HI>Tombes</HI> received (purposely intended for him) was from Mr.
<HI>Baxters</HI> hand, which work contains many irrefragable Ar∣guments
to assert Infants Church-Membership, and Baptism
from several Scripture-Texts, if not of themselves plain, yet
made plain, so that he needs not blush at his Title; but
he doth not make it: his businesse fully to answer Argu∣ments
on the contrary, where he is most full, I have been
most brief; where he is most brief, I have been more large;
he hath satisfied his Reader, I hope the Reader will say that
I have in that part done somewhat for satisfaction of my
adversary.</P>
<P>Sixthly, The last part of this Treatise (as the advice
on the top of the leaf may signifie) is no more than a new
Edition of, with an ample addition to my <HI>Birth-priviledge,</HI>
which above my expectation found so good acceptation,
onely handling it there Sermon-wise, as fixt on a proper
Text, and here by way of Treatise, as a branch of this do∣ctrine
of the Covenant, I was put to it in a great part to
change the methodand texture of it, so that it may rather
seem to those that compare them, a new frame, with much
borrowed from it, than the same reprinted and enlarged;
and there I have endeavoured satisfaction to that which
some have said in the way, admitting Infants not accord∣ing
to their Parents-priviledges, but qualification: not
as they stand in relation to God, but as they fill up their
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
relation, which new limit I hope I have discovered to
be unwarrantably put, casting those out which the
Church (according to the mind of God) from <HI>Abraham</HI>
to this time hath received, to the disquiet of our Congre∣gations,
and multiplication of our sad, and deplorable diffe∣rences.</P>
<P>Seventhly, I have made it my businesse to avoid all im∣pertinencies
and unnecessary dilatations, being ambiti∣ous
to speak <HI>multa in paucis,</HI> and not to put the Reader to
paines to finde out a little which may serve his purpose
in much, affecting brevity so farre as may be without ob∣scurity:
In all which, I shall only request two things of
the Reader, and both of them such that God himself com∣mands.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A double re∣quest made to the Reader.</NOTE> Not to have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Lord of glory with respect of persons, that he do not take
an estimate of doctrinal points, or controverted opinions, ac∣cording
to the outward garb in which men appear, by rea∣son
of any dignity, relation power, or any such circumstance
whatsoever; If this once prevail, opinions will be taken up,
not according to the strength of truth, that is seen in them,
but according to the quality of him that vents them; they
will judge of the faith by the men, not of the men by the
faith, and upon this account on all hands truth is in dan∣ger:
And as men in their reputations ebbe and flow, their
judgements of things must hold up or fall. Truths some∣times
will be cast off, barely on the low repute, and meane
condition of such that do deliver them: Though Christ
spake as never man spake, and al treasures of wisdome were
hid in him, yet it was enough against him that he was a
Carpenters son, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 55: that none of the Pharisees
and Rulers beleeved in him, or sided with him, <HI>John</HI> 7. 48.
A poor man may save a City, and never the lesse his wis∣dome
despised, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 9. 16. sometimes because they are
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
not men of our interests that hold it, they make not up
a party for us. The more considerable the interest is,
the greater the hazard (in these cases) truth runnes. <HI>Paul</HI>
being brought before a Councel, <HI>Acts</HI> 23. had not a man of
whom we can read for him, but all against him, for this rea∣son,
because it did not appear that his opinions served any of
their Interests; when he observed this, and saw their Interests
divided, and that his adversaries made two parties, he de∣clares
himself to be for the Interest of the one against the o∣ther,
and in point of the Resurrection to be for the Phari∣sees
against the Sadduces, bred up in that way, and so per∣sisted;
hereupon having not a friend before, now he hath ma∣ny:
<HI>There arose a great cry, and the Scribes that were of the Pha∣risees
part arose, and strove, saying, We find no fault in this man,
but if a spirit, or an Angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight a∣gainst
God,</HI> Verse 9. now and not before he must be heard.
Upon the same terms that truth is cast off, errour is received
and taken in, nothing must be gainsaid, that men of name, &amp;
men of Interest will appear to own; yea, relations, kindred,
and affections this way gained, are mightily prevalent, to
work into Faction and take up Tenents. As diseases many
times run in a blood; so also opinions where they take in a
kindred, often very few escape. Twenty Sermons, were <HI>Paul,</HI>
yea, Jesus Christ in the Pulpit, would not so take to
settle men in the truth, as one poor Letter, or
simple senselesse three-pennie Pamphlet from the
hand of a childe, a brother, or sister will work to
draw into Errour. I will not here undertake to deter∣mine
who are meant by children in that speech of our
Saviour Christ, <HI>Matthew</HI> 12. 27. It appears that
it spake some relation, that drew affections, and
therefore whereas Christ is censured to cast out Devils
by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the chief of Devils, when any of these
do such a work, they are cryed up in another manner.
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
It was a true Observation of him that said, <HI>Omnia diota
tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> astimantur, quantum est ipse qui dixerii, nectam dicti∣onis
vim, atque virtutem, quam dictatoris cogitent digni∣tatem.</HI></P>
<P>The second request of mine is, that men take heed of
having mens persons in admiration, because of advan∣tage;
we have seen the mischief that respect of persons
works, and advantages will work men in the height of it.
That way that men can either save themselves from dan∣ger,
and hold where they are, or rise up to a greater height,
the world is apt to take, and the Religion of that side shall
be theirs. Hence it is, that when godlinesse ought to be
the chiefest gain, gain with these is their whole godlinesse;
and state Religion is almost the faith of every man. Those
of that party still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
depart the least from the very height of their own princi∣ples
for it, but they will have all others upon account of
their prevalency come into it: so that <HI>self</HI> is no other than
their unity paraphrased, and so long as providence holds
them up, they are not much mistaken: <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sians</HI> will become
Jewes, when <HI>Mordecai</HI> a Jew is the man that rules. <HI>Saul</HI>
saw that that was a mighty motive to draw a party in war,
to have the gift of vineyards, and oliveyards, to be the
fountain of honour, able to make Captaines over thou∣sands,
hundreds, fifties. It is no lesse to draw on a party
in Religion, as every turne of State respective to Religion
is a clear evidence: If these stumble upon truth, they yet,
hold it upon such carnal motives, that they are neither true
to it, nor receive the comfort of it: Make truth then the
greatest advantage, there is glory enough in it, without
any farther garb to have it in admiration: own it though
with a scracht face where you find it; though you be o∣therwise
at losse, it will bring an hundred-fold with it.
If I can but gain these things at thy hands, I shall not
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
feare that this piece shall run the hazzard of thy censure;
spare no errour in it, so that thou wilt gladly take up,
and rest satisfied in all the truths that thou findest.
That truth may have the first place in thy soul, is
the desire and prayers of him that can do nothing a∣gainst,
but for the truth,</P>

<HEAD>An Advertisement to the Reader touching this
second Edition.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was once the sad complaint of Reverend
<HI>Davenant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissertatio. de morti Christi. <HI>Cap. 1. pag.</HI> 1.</NOTE> that, <HI>Religionis nostrae mysteria, quae
sunt ad parem &amp; solatium animarum promulga∣ta,
in solam penè litigandi &amp; pugnandi materiam
vertantur.</HI> The great mysteries of Religion, those pre∣tious
Beamings of the Sunne of righteousnesse which
were shed abroad, for the begetting of spiritual heat
and life in the beleeving heart, were often eclipsed, and
their influence much debilitated, through the intervening
body of cloudy Controversies. This way Satan gained up∣on
the Church in its Infancy, which gave occasion to that
good admonition, we have upon record from the blessed
Apostle, Heb. 13. 9. <HI>Be not carryed about with diverse and
strange doctrines, for it is a good thing that the heart be esta∣blished
with grace;</HI> What these <HI>diverse</HI> and <HI>strange doctrines</HI>
were, Interpreters have their different thoughts, which I
shall wholly wave; the Reader may yet observe the Apostle
hinting at, and tacitely reproving, the pronenesse that was
in men eagerly to pursue, studiously to sweat, and tug a∣bout
empty notions, whilest the spiritual sense, and feeling
of truth in the heart, was little heeded. The same Apostle
traces Satan in the same design among the <HI>Colossians,</HI> Cap.
2. Which puts him upon that pathetical exhortation, Cap. 3.
To <HI>seek the things that are above,</HI> to lay out their zeal, and
centre their affections upon things of a more solid, sublime,
and spiritual nature, <HI>viz.</HI> the application of Christ in the
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
power of his death, and precious in-comes of his Spirit for
the mortification of lust. What unspeakable advantage this
continued enemy of a beleevers life and comfort hath gain∣ed
in our age (not to mention the spoyles made in the in∣tervening)
our present breaches, sad decays, two
fully evidence; yea, so fully, that did not a graciory
word uphold, and everlasting armes fix themselves un∣derneath,
our ruines had been uncapable, of any further
breach. In the midst of these astonishing providences,
and terrible dispensations, the Lord (such is his infinite wis∣dome,
and goodnesse) hath brought forth meat out of the
strong, and honey, out of the destroyer. These windy
stormes have through rich grace more deeply rooted some,
whilest others have been tossed to, and fro; these Contro∣versal
collissions have brought forth much light; thus Satan
lyes bleeding under his own weapons. Among other pre∣cious
treasures which the Church through mercy doth en∣joy,
here thou mayest see truths of the greatest concern∣ment
to beleevers polemically vindicated, practically im∣proved,
that mens judgments might be ballanced, and their
hearts feel the weight of truth, both which necessarily make
up a beleevers acquaintance with the truths of Christ as they
are <HI>in him.</HI> The Covenant of grace both in its sure mercies,
and distinguishing priviledges, is a truth of the greatest mag∣nitude,
appearing rather as a glorious constellation, than
shining with the light of a single starre; It is a rich Cabinet
of Diamonds, rather than any single jewel. How far the Re∣verend
Authour (my ever Honoured and endeared Father)
hath been serviceable in the hands of Christ for the unseal∣ing
of this rich Cabinet, the abundant acceptance which
this Treatise found from men eminently judicious, when it
was wrapped up in the swadling bands of blurred papers, be∣fore
it went abroad, doth fully speak. I need not adde those
many special acknowledgments from some of the ablest
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
pens in the Nation, which after the Authors death were
found upon the file in his study; much might be spoken by
me, did not my relation to him command a silence; the <HI>Ly∣dian</HI>
Princes tongue would break no bonds; when violence
was offered to his father; give me leave to apply that to the
Reverend Author, which sometimes was observed of the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Orator, that in his publique discourses, he did not
only <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but <HI>aculeos in animis auditorum relinquere;</HI>
And if I may without envy adde holy <HI>Melancthons</HI> pythy
verse upon <HI>Luthers</HI> picture, <HI>Fulmina erant linguae singula
verba tuae.</HI> But I shall forbear, craving only thy patience,
in receiving an account, how far thy gain will be doubled,
in this second Edition: In the <HI>first,</HI> the Learned Author was
necessitated to take notice of several controversies, which
were then started, these afterwards growing more personal
(&amp; therefore only beautiful in their season) are in <HI>this</HI> whol∣ly
waved, and truths asserted in <HI>Thesi.</HI> In the <HI>first,</HI> several
expressions (through the natural brevity of the Authours
stile) were obscure, and occasioned the readers stumbling,
In <HI>this</HI> they receive an additional light, what passages might
seem abstruse, now are enlarged. In the <HI>first</HI> the method was
unavoidably clouded in several places through digressions,
and appendices, In <HI>this</HI> each head is digested in its proper
place. In the <HI>first,</HI> several things were omitted which now
upon second thoughts, and deeper wading into the contro∣versies
herein handled, are by the learned Authour in this in∣serted;
And the whol of this don by the Authors own hand,
which he had no sooner taken off, and sent it to the Presse,
but the Lord dispatched a fiery chariot for him, which took
him away to the enjoyment of <HI>Truth</HI> it self; what thou read∣est
of him now, was sealed with his death. They that were ac∣quainted
with his state, and frame of spirit in that juncture
of time when it was finished, must needs testifie, there was
no room for any carnal end to byasse, or self-interest to
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
steer his notions. Respective to the doctrine here asserted,
I shall assure thee from the mouth of this blessed Author,
that as he sweetly laid down his life, in clear, and unspeak∣able
assurance of glory, so he dyed without the least Scruple
in any of the truths here vindicated. I shall no longer enter∣tain
thee in the porch, but give thee possession of the house,
craving only thy Candor in the perusal of it; orphane chil∣dren
though under the eye and care of endearing friends, yet
sometimes may feel the want of a parental wing, I am not
without fears that this Orphane Treatise, may complain of
som Errata's, through the Authors unexpected death, the slow
progresse of the Presse, and my great distance from it. The
God of truth teach thee how to profit, break every shell,
that thou mayest taste of the kernel, clear up truths to thy
apprehension, and imprint them upon thy heart, so prayes
he, who beggs thy prayers for him, because he is</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Introduction into the whole.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Shall not make it my businesse, for an Introduction
into this Work, to enquire after the derivation of
the word. Etymologies are known to be no defi∣nitions;
The denomination being usually given,
from some adjuncts, variable, according to times &amp;
places, and not from any thing that is of the essence
of that which is enquired after, in which those are highest in
Criticismes, in giving their judgements of them, can yet ordinarily
go no higher then conjecture; The common acception of the
<PB N="2" REF="19"/>
word in Scripture is that which will give the greatest light, in
finding out the nature of Scripture covenants, which as most o∣ther
words is variously used. Sometimes is used <HI>Properly,</HI> im∣plying
a covenant in deed and truth, strictly so called, and con∣taining
all the requisites of a Covenant in it. Sometimes <HI>Tropically,</HI>
for that which contains some parts and adjuncts of a covenant,
and so carries some resemblance to, and stands in some affinity
with it. This Tropical figurative, and the native proper sense
must be carefully distinguished, and may by no meanes be con∣founded,
by those that will understand the true nature of a co∣venant,
and avoid those manifold mistakes, into which some up∣on
this a lone account have been carried:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figurative ac∣ceptions of the word Covenant.</NOTE> The figurative accep∣tions
of the word, are diverse, sometimes the homage re∣quired,
or duty covenanted for, is called a covenant by way of
Synechdoche, seeing a covenant between a Superiour and Infe∣riour
doth comprize it, so <HI>Jerem. 34. 13. I made a Covenant with
your fathers, in the day that I brought them out of the Land of E∣gypt,</HI>
which Covenant is no other then the Law that he gave
them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 21. 2. Sometimes the promise annext, is called by
the name of a covenant, by a like Synechdoche, Gen. 17. 7. <HI>I
will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after
thee, in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God
unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, Gen.</HI> 9. 11. Sometimes the
Seal is called by the name of a Covenant, by way of Metonymy of
the adjunct, serving to ratifie and confirme a covenant, <HI>Gen. 17. 10.
This is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and
thy seed after thee, every man-childe among you shall be circumcised.</HI>
Sometimes Christ the Mediatour of the covenant is called by a
like figure, the covenant, <HI>Isa. 42. 6, 7. I will give thee for a co∣venant
of the people, and light unto the Gentiles.</HI> Sometimes the
Lord Christs undertaking, to work the graces covenanted for, in
the hearts of his people, in the way of his power, exerted in the
conversion of sinners, is called by the name of a covenant, <HI>Jerem.
31. 33. This is the covenant that I will make with the whole house of
Israel, after those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts;</HI> of which more in its
own place. Sometimes a covenant is taken for that peace, which
usually followes upon covenants, <HI>Job 5. 23. Thou shalt be
in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>
be at peace with thee,</HI> Hos. 2. 18. <HI>In that day I will make a covenant
for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowles of heaven, and
with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bowe,
and the sword, and the battel out of the earth, and will make them to
lie down safely.</HI> When yet neither a Law, nor a Promise, nor
Seal annext, nor yet the Mediatour, or any undertaking of his,
can be a covenant properly so called. A Law from God with a Pro∣mise
annext, assented to by man, is a covenant; and when a Seal
is added, there is a condescension to our weaknesse, for the more
abundant ratification and confirmation of Gods stability in his
Promises. In our enquiry after such covenants, which God in his
gracious condescension is pleased to enter with man the general
nature of a covenant must be held, every <HI>species</HI> must partake of
its <HI>Genus;</HI> We must not make Gods covenant with man, so farre
to differ, from covenants between man and man, as to make it no
covenant at all; we must also observe that which differences it
from covenants meerly humane, that covenants divine and hu∣mane
be not confounded together. In order to which we must
know that in every covenant properly so called, these requisites
must concur.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requisites in a Covenant.</NOTE> it must not be of one alone, but at least of two parties,
one can make no bargain or agreement. Secondly, there must
be a mutual consent of these parties. When <HI>Nahash</HI> the Ammonite,
offered to make a Covenant with <HI>Israel,</HI> on condition that he
might thrust out all their right eyes, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. 2. the Israelites
refusing and running the hazard of a fight, rather then undergo
it, here was no covenant. Thirdly, each party must engage
themselves one to another, for performance of somewhat cove∣nanted
for, whether debt, duty, or promise. When <HI>Abraham</HI> a∣greed
with the Hittites for a burial place for foure hundred She∣kels,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 23. 15, 16. There was a covenant properly so called,
having apparently in it all requisites of a covenant. So also in
<HI>Jeremies</HI> purchase, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32. 10. and the Levites hiring of himselfe
to do the office of a Priest, <HI>Judg. 17. 10. Micah</HI> and he mutual∣ly
agree, he is to do the office of a Priest, and <HI>Micah</HI> is to pay his
covenant-wages; so that he hit right of the nature of a cove∣nant,
that defined it to be <HI>A mutual agreement between parties
upon Articles or Propositions on both sides, so that each partie is tied
and bound to perform his own conditions.</HI> This holds forth the ge∣neral
<PB N="4" REF="20"/>
nature of a covenant, and is common to all covenants,
publick and private, divine or humane, differencing it first from
a Law or Precept, where there is a command out of sovereignty
propounded, without any obligation or engagement on the Law∣giver
or Commander. Secondly, from a single promise, where
there is a signification of the will of him that makes the pro∣mise,
touching some good to him to whom the promise is made,
without any restipulation, from him; And to let passe several
Divisions of covenants, little pertinent to our purpose (which
may be seen in Civilians and Politians, particularly in <HI>Grotius
lib. 2. De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis, cap.</HI> 15.) and to speak to such, which
may give some light to the present work. Covenans of this na∣ture
properly so called, are either between equals, where either
party may indifferently indent with other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinctions of Covenants.</NOTE> neither standing enga∣ged
to other, otherwise then by covenant, as in the instances
before, mentioned. The Priest was not engaged to officiate for
<HI>Micah,</HI> nor <HI>Micah</HI> to give money or rayment to the Priest, but
by, vertue of contract, one was the others equal, in regard of
any dependance one upon the other. Or else they are between
Superiour and Inferiour, the Superiour condescending to the In∣feriour,
to deale by way of covenant, when yet the whole that
is required by him, is of debt, and might without agreement or
stipulation be required and exacted. This superiority and infe∣riority,
is either mixt and imperfect, or else it is absolute and
sovereigne: Mixt and imperfect superiority, and inferiority, is,
between parent and childe, master and servant, equal in
being, but Superiour and Inferiour in relation; Of this nature was
that of <HI>Isaac</HI> with <HI>Esau,</HI> Gen. 27. 34. <HI>Take I pray thee thy wea∣pons,
thy quiver and thy bowe, and go out to the field to take me some
venison, and make me savoury meat, such as I love, that my soul may
blesse thee before I die; Esau</HI> was tied as a childe to do what
<HI>Isaac</HI> required, though he had hinted or promised no blessing;
Superiority and Inferiority, absolute and sovereigne, is only be∣tween
God and his creature, no other is an absolute Superiour;
and such is the covenant, when God enters covenant. It is of so∣vereignty
that God makes a Law; It is of condescension and
goodnesse that he enters covenant, in which man may not in∣dent,
but must accept, professedly accepting, and in sincerity of
heart performing, what God in covenant demands; yet it is a
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>
covenant, and properly so called, that he enters with his creature,
especially that which he enters with mankind, having all the in∣gredients,
and fore-named requisites of a covenant, as in the se∣quel
(God willing) shall be demonstrated. God is engaged to
retribution, and man to fealty, and either of both by consent.
Covenants between any parties, whether Superiour and Inferi∣our,
or equals among themselves, are either simply and naked∣ly
such without any farther solemnity, or ceremony, or any thing
more then is essentially necessary in a Covenant, a mutual en∣gagement
between each other on such termes and propositions
as are mutually agreed. Or else they are covenants with addi∣tion
of ceremonies, solemnities, wayes of ratification and con∣firmation;
as instances might be given in covenants, both hu∣mane
and divine; As the committing the words of the Covenant
to writing <HI>Jer.</HI> 32. 10. Calling in witnesses, in the same place,
and <HI>Ruth</HI> 4. 10, 11. giving of the hand, making oath, <HI>Ezek.</HI>

upon themselves by way of imprecation, such a judgement that
then befel that beast, in case of falsification, so that some ma∣king
definition of a covenant, over and above what is essential,
make addition of such wayes of ratification; so <HI>Ravanellus</HI>
defines a Covenant to be, <HI>A mu∣tual
agreement of two parties,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutus pactio disarum partium, quâ altera alterise ecritis conditionibus obligar ad aliquid faciendum, dandum aut accipiendum, adhibitis signis &amp; Symbolis externis, ad solennem testifi∣cationem confirmationis causa, ut promissio sit inviolabilis, Sic &amp; <HI>Ursinus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>in which ei∣ther
ties himself to other upon certain con∣ditions
in the use of some outward signes
and tokens, for attestation and confirmati∣on,
that the promise may be inviolable.</HI> The
covenant which God pleases to enter
with man, especially with fallen man, under which we are,
and our fathers in old Testament-administrations were, is not a
bare naked covenant, but in the highest way of solemnity, com∣mitted
to writing, <HI>John</HI> 20. 31. confirmed by witnesses with
miracles, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 4. by oath, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 13. 17. by seals, <HI>Matth. 28.
19. Matth.</HI> 26. 28. compared with <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. And when he
might have dealt with man, by way of sovereignty, ruling sole∣ly
by prerogative and command, not letting man know any re∣ward
for his service, or at all to have understood the issue and e∣vent;
<PB N="6" REF="21"/>
yet he is pleased to wave such right, and to deal by way
of covenant, and that in this way here mentioned.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why God deals with man in a Cove∣nant-way.</NOTE> That his people might be willing in the day of his power,
<HI>Psalme</HI> 110. 3. Obedience extorted, contributes not that honour
to him, whom we obey, we confesse a necessity in our selves to
yeeld, but scarce acknowledge any worth in such a Superiour to
command; serving no otherwise then <HI>Israel</HI> did <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> as a
bond man serves his master, one volunteer that goes out of
choice, more honours an expedition, then ten that are prest by
power for service, only waiting an opportunity by slealth, out of
dislike, as <HI>Davids</HI> souldiers out of shame, to quit the service,
<HI>I Sam.</HI> 19. 3.</P>
<P>Secondly, to vanquish all temptations, and overcome all as∣saults
that may occurre in mans way of obedience; <HI>Adam</HI> in
innocency was foiled by a temptation, which he had overcome, in
case he had heeded the terms of the covenant, the curse that was
threatened, and the promise that was contained in it; man in his
fallen estate undergoes many tryals, and is encountered with vari∣ety
of temptations, had he not a word on which he might hope, a
word of promise in way of covenant from God; he could not stand,
but of necessity must perish.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that love rather then fear might principle man in his o∣bedience,
as seeing more of goodnesse to induce, then of wrath to
scare him into it; God will have his servants, sons. The free honour
of a childe to his father, rather then the compulsory fear of a ser∣vant,
pleases him.</P>
<P>Fourthly, for the aggravation of sinne; The more of condescen∣sion,
goodnesse, bounty, and love appears, in Gods way of dealing;
the more of equity is seen, and the more ingratitude and folly ap∣pears
in mans disobedience.</P>
<P>Fifthly, for mans greater consolation; An up-right-hearted
man findes abundance of peace, in his covenant entered with
God; when he prayes and seeks the greatest mercy in prayer, he
is able to say, <HI>In thy faithfulnesse answer me, and in thy righteous∣nesse,</HI>
Psal. 143. 1. <HI>Paul</HI> can say, that <HI>God the righteous Judge shall
give him a Crown of righteousnesse,</HI> 2 Tim. 4. 8. Having engaged
by covenant, righteousnesse ties him to make good his engage∣ments;
This is Gods end, in his entrance of covenant, and rati∣fication
of it by oath, consequently, in committing it to writing,
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
and confirming it by seal; <HI>That by two immuntable things in which
it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation,
who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,</HI> Heb.
6. 18. These strong consolations were the end of God, in rati∣fying
his Covenant, They are the support, and Spirit reviving cor∣dials
to his people in Covenant; See the result of the Psalmists
meditations, <HI>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy
comforts delight my soul,</HI> Psalme 94. 19. <HI>I will both lay me down in
peace and sleep, for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety,</HI> Psalme
4. 8. <HI>The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I feare?
The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?</HI> Psal.
27. 1.</P>
<P>Sixthly, for the greater terrour of the adversaries of his peo∣ple,
when they see themselves engaged against them, and God
stands in a covenant unviolable engaged for them; when they
see, that their work is to ruinate and destroy him that God will
save. Hence it is while their Rock sells them not, one of them
chases a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, <HI>Deut. 32.
30. Paul</HI> in bonds can make <HI>Felix</HI> tremble on his Throne, <HI>Acts
24. 25. Hamans</HI> wise-men, and <HI>Zeresh</HI> his wife spake words of
terrour, upon experiment made, <HI>If Mordecai be of the seed of the
Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not
prevaile against him, but shalt surely fall before him,</HI> Ester
6. 13.</P>
<P>Seventhly, the Lord hereby puts a name, and an honour upon his
people. <HI>David</HI> took it to be an honour to be related to <HI>Saul,</HI>
and, so to become the sonne of a King, much more then, is it an
honour to be brought into this relation to God. This honour
have all the Saints, and they are taken into covenant for honour
sake, <HI>The Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar peo∣ple,
as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his
Commandments; and to make thee high above all Nations which he
hath made, in praise, and in honour, and that thou mayest be an holy
people to the Lord thy God,</HI> Deut. 26. 18, 19. They are, the portion,
the inheritance, the children, the espoused ones, and whatso∣ever
else that speaks a neer relation is theirs.</P>
<P>This was Gods way of dealing (I doubt not) with the Angels
though (we being not interested in it) there is no necessity that
it should be written for our learning: Sure we are, it was his way
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
of dealing with man, as well before his fall, (as presently shall be
shewn) as out of more abundant grace and condescension for
his restitution. And not mentioning for present any more,
then that which is essential in the covenant, of God with man,
I suppose it may be thus held out to us:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant between God and Man defined.</NOTE> <HI>A mutual compact or a∣greement
between God and man upon just and equal termes pre∣scribed
by himself, in which God promises true happinesse to man, and
man engages himself by promise for performance of what God re∣quires.</HI>
This description here laid down, comprizes the way of
God, in every one of his covenants with man both before and af∣ter
his fall, under Old and New Testament-revelations, all that
is essential in any covenant that he enters; Equals covenanting
do either of them article and indent, but God condescending to a
covenant, man must not article, but must assent, and engage
for performance of what is prescribed, otherwise it will hear the
nature of a Law, but not of a Covenant. It is true, all men are
bound upon tender from God, to accept; It was the sin of Jew∣ish
and heathenish people, to stand out whensoever the Gospel
was preached; but they were no covenant-people till they gave
their assent, and then they were received as a covenant-people,
and baptized. Exceptions cannot be taken against, or challenge
made of this definition of covenants in general, nor of the co∣venant
which God in particular entereth with man; and these
standing, they will give us light, and afford us singular help for a
right understanding of the covenant of God, entered with
man in the several species, and distinct wayes of administration
of it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Covenant of God entered with mankinde,
distinguished.</HEAD>
<P>THere is a two-fold covenant, which God out of his graci∣ous
condescension, hath vouchsafed to enter with man. The
first immediately upon the creation of man, when man yet stood
right in his eye, and bore his image, the alone creature on earth,
<PB N="9" REF="22"/>
that was in a capacity to enter covenant. We have not indeed
the word covenant, till after man was fallen, nor yet in any place
of Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God entered Covenant with man in his e∣state of inte∣grity.</NOTE> in reference to the transactions past between God
and man in his state of integrity, neither have we such expressions
that fully and explicitely hold out a covenant to us, but we finde
it implied, and so much expressed, from whence a covenant with
the conditions of it is evinced. That Law, with the penalty an∣next,
given to our first parents (<HI>Gen. 2. 17. Of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil thou shalt not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at; for in the day that thou eatest, thou
shalt surely die;</HI>) plainly implies in it, a covenant entred; man
was in present possession of life (that is according to Scripture.
phrase, happinesse) in his whole person full and compleat ac∣cording
to his present capacity, This is to be continued (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is
there evidently implied) till sinne dispossesse him of it; Till he
sin he shall not die; As long as he persists in his integrity, his
life is to be continued, of which the Tree of Life (as is not to be
doubted) was a Sacrament. The second, God was pleased to en∣ter
with man upon his fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grace is the fountain and first rise of e∣very Covenant of God with man:</NOTE> which was a covenant of reconcili∣ation,
the most unhappy variance between earth and heaven ha∣ving
intervened. The former, is, usually called a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovenant of Works,</HI>
the latter, is, called a <HI>covenant of Grace,</HI> though indeed, the fountain,
and first rise of either, was the free grace, and favour of God.
For howsoever the first covenant was on condition of obedi∣ence,
and engaged to the reward of Works, yet it was of Grace,
that God made any such promise, of reward to any work of man,
when man had done all (even in that estate) which was com∣manded,
he was still an unprofitable servant, he had done no
more then duty, and no emolument did thence accrew to his Ma∣ker.
It was enough that he was upheld, and sustained of God in
the work, to live in him, and upon him, when the work was done he
might have been justly annihilated. If merit be taken in a proper
sense, <HI>Adam</HI> in innocency was too low for it, all his work being
an homage due, no profit redounding to God, and the work
bearing no proportion to the reward. But a more superabun∣dant
measure of Grace is seen in Gods entrance into covenant
with man in his fallen condition, and infinitely more savor is shewn
in his reconciliation, then in his preservation▪ Therefore this
by way of eminency hath the honour to be stiled the covenant
of Grace, the other retaines the name of the covenant of Works.
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
These two bearing these denominations have their respective a∣greement,
and differences, which are to be enquired into: but
before I reach those, it is necessary that somewhat be spoken to
assert a covenant of grace, in Gospel-times, and to give us some
further light for a right understanding of it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Covenant in the proper nature of it, between God, and
fallen man, asserted.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I proceed any further in this work; one great rub
that lies in the way, is to be removed, otherwise, not only,
all that which I have said; but also, all that which I shall speak
on this subject, will fall to the ground, and that is their objection
that say, that God hath not entred any covenant, properly so
called, with fallen man. He hath by way of Sovereignty, laid
commands upon man; Of free grace hath made rich and large
promises, by way of legacy bequeathed life and salvation to
him, but hath entred no covenant properly so called (as these
say) with him, which is purposely done to avoid those conditions,
which are asserted in this covenant. If this stand, the division before
laid down, of a Covenant into a Covenant of Works, and a Co∣venant
of Grace necessarily falls, such a division must not be suf∣fered,
where any one member of the division is not, If therefore
there be no covenant of God with fallen man, nor no such thing
as the covenant of Grace, there can be no such division of the
covenant, and all agreement or differences assigned; will be be∣tween
an entity, and a non-entity; between that which hath a
reality, and a meer Chimaera. A covenant therefore in the proper
nature of it, is to be asserted and the speed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est way to make this
good, is to prove from Scripture the name and the thing, that
the word <HI>Covenant</HI> is there, and the thing, in the proper nature
of it, which the words hold out; and all of this respective to
the transactions between God and fallen man. The word we
finde in places without number, it were a needlesse labour to
give instances, when every Reader is able to furnish himself with
<PB N="11" REF="23"/>
such multitudes. But when this cannot be denyed, the impro∣priety
of the speech is objected. It is called by the name of a
Covenant (as is said) when in strict propriety of speech, it is no
covenant; But to avoid this, the thing it self may be as easily
proved as the word, and when we have <HI>nomen,</HI> and <HI>nominis ratio∣nem,</HI>
then we have a covenant, not equivocally not yet analogi∣cally,
but properly so called. And here I may deal liberally with
any adversary, and undertake to make proof, not only of all the
essentials of such a covenant in Scripture, but the usual adjuncts,
not onely of all, that makes up the nature, but all accessories u∣sually
added to the solemnity of covenants. The essentials or
real properties of a covenant, are contained in the usual definiti∣ons
which afterwards we shall see laid down from several hands,
all of which are in short comprised in these words, <HI>A mutual con∣sent
of parties with stipulation on both sides.</HI> Parties, consent, and
mutual engagement is all that is required to the same being of a
covenant; when two parties agree, and either of them both, have
their conditions to make good, there is a covenant or bargaine;
see it exemplified in several instances given, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. All of these
we finde in that one place, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26. 17, 18, 19. in the cove∣nant
that God enters with his people, <HI>Thou hast avouched the
Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes, and to keep his
Statutes, and his Commandments, and his Judgements, and to
hearken to his voice: And the Lord hath avouched thee this day
to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that
thou shouldest keep all his Commandments; And to make thee high
above all Nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and
in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the Lord thy
God, as he hath spoken.</HI> There are the Covenanters, <HI>God</HI> and <HI>his
people;</HI> There is consent on both parties, <HI>Thou hast avouched,
the Lord hath avouched;</HI> And there is a <HI>stipulation</HI> on both
sides; On Gods part, <HI>To make them high above all Nations; which
he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour:</HI> On the
peoples part, <HI>To keep all his Commandments, to be an holy peo∣ple.</HI>
There are covenant-mercies from God to his people, un∣to
which of grace he engages himself; and there are covenant-duties
unto which man stands engaged, <HI>Psal. 103. 17, 18. But the
mercie of the Lord is from euerlasting to everlasting, upon them that
fear him, and his righteousnesse unto childrens children; to such as
<PB N="12" REF="24"/>
keep his Covenant, and to those that remember his Command∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>The usual solemnities of a covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the usual accessories on solemnities.</NOTE> are also found, in the
transactions between God and his people, as well as the essen∣tials
of it. 1. Covenants used to be written▪ for memorial for po∣sterity,
and so is the covenant, between God and man, as in Old,
so in New Testament-times. <HI>These things are written that you
might believe, and that believing you may have everlasting life,</HI>
John 20. 31. 2. Covenants used to be confirmed with <HI>outward
visible signes,</HI> as the killing of beasts, <HI>Gen. 15. Jer.</HI> 34. this was done
in the old administration, <HI>Exod.</HI> 24. Half of the blood was sprink∣led
upon the Altar, to denote Gods entering of Covenant, <HI>vers.</HI>
6. The people also were sprinkled with blood, to shew their
voluntary entring into covenant, <HI>vers.</HI> 8. And in the new dis∣pensation,
a new and unheard of ratification was used, the blood
of the Mediatour of the Covenant, <HI>Math. 26. 27, 28. This
Cup is my blood in the New Testament, which was shed for you, and
for many, for the remission of sins.</HI> This latter is a plain allusion to
the former, in which you may finde. 1. A threefold agreement.
Either of both these were covenants. 2. Either of both these,
had their ratifications and confirmations. 3. Either of both were
confirmed with blood. 2. A threefold difference. 1. The former
was the Old covenant, which was antiquated; This is the New.
2. The former was ratified, and sanctified with the blood of beasts:
This is ratified and sanctified, in the blood of Christ. 3. That blood
could never take away sin, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. This was shed for many, for
remission of sins.</P>
<P>Thirdly, covenants use to be confirmed by <HI>seal:</HI> so, is, this co∣venant,
between God and his people, which is to be spoken to
elsewhere.</P>
<P>As the being of a covenant is thus plentifully proved by Scrip∣ture-testimony, so we might as amply prove it by arguments
drawn from thence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments e∣vincing a Co∣venant in the proper nature of it.</NOTE> The Churches of Christ are espoused unto
Christ, <HI>Hos. 2. 19, 20. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever;
yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousnesse, and in judge∣ment,
and in loving kindnesse, and in mercies; I will even betroth
thee unto me in faithfulnesse, and thou shalt know the Lord.</HI>
2 Cor. 11. 2. <HI>I have espoused you to one husband, that I may
present you to Christ;</HI> and Spouses are in covenant with their
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
Bridegroom. The Churches of Christ are married to Christ: <HI>Isa.
54. 5. Thy Maker is thine Husband, the Lord of hosts is his Name,
and thy Redeemer the holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth
shall he be called.</HI> And wives are in covenant with their husbands.
Their sinnes against God are branded with the names of Adulte∣ries,
Whoredomes; and these are not barely dis-obedience of a
Command, or neglect of a favour, but breaches of covenant.
The Churches of Christ are servants of Christ, <HI>Levit.</HI> 25. houshold
servants, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 19. and servants are their Masters by covenant.
Their sinnes in this relation are not barely obstinacy, stubbornness,
or ingratitude, but they are charged with treachery, falsehood,
dealing falsely in covenant, and their hearts being not stedfast in
covenant. It is above me to conceive, how man can be a cove∣nant-breaker,
(not alone respective to man, but God, as he is fre∣quently
charged) when there hath past no covenant between God
and him. They may question, whether there were ever any such
thing, as a covenant in the world, that deny this to be a covenant,
in the proper nature of it; some objections raised in their due place
will be answered.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Covenant of Grace is between God and man; and not be∣tween
God and Christ.</HEAD>
<P>HAving asserted a covenant in the proper nature of it, it is ne∣cessary,
before I proceed further on, to give differences be∣tween
this covenant of Works, and the covenant of Grace, to
speak something by way of Explication, covenant being taken in
so various and ambiguous senses, or at least so many senses put
upon it, which I take to be a misunderstanding of the Scripture-covenant,
I shall lay down certaine Explicatory Propositions for
clearing of the thing in question. And the leading on shall be
this. <HI>The Covenant of grace is between God and man, between
God, and those of fallen mankinde, that he pleases to take into cove∣nant,
God and man are the two parties in the covenant; It is not made
between God and Christ.</HI> This is so plain, that a man might think
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
there needed no words about it, but that there are some that will
have man to be no party in it, and that it is entred onely with
Christ on behalf of those that God hath chosen in Christ to him∣self.
To this I shall speak first by way of concession, yeelding to
them of this opinion, these three things that follow. 1. That there
is such a covenant of which they speak, which was entred between
God and Christ, containing the transactions which passe between
the Father and the Sonne, the tenor of which covenant we find
laid down by the Prophet, <HI>Esay 53. 10, &amp;c.</HI> and commented
upon by the Apostle, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 6. There we see, first the work that
Christ by covenant was to undergo, <HI>To make his soul an offering for
sinne,</HI> that is, as elsewhere is exprest, to give his life a ransome
for many, and as he covenanted, so he did, <HI>He became obedient to
death, even the death of the crosse,</HI> Phil. 2. 8. and that, upon ac∣count
of this covenant entred, Christ himself speaking to it, and
of his work in it, saith, <HI>John 10. 18. This Commandment have I
received of my Father.</HI> Secondly, the reward that he was to re∣ceive,
which is laid down by the Prophet in many words. 1. <HI>He
shall see his seed,</HI> ver. 10. As <HI>Isaac</HI> being received from the dead
in a figure, saw a seed, had an innumerable posterity; so the
Lord Christ who was received from the dead in truth; hath his
seed in like manner, beleevers innumerable, which are called
his seed in resemblance to the seed of man. 2. <HI>He shall
prolong his dayes,</HI> not the dayes of his seed, as some would have
it, making this one with the former, and rendring the words <HI>vi∣debit
semen longaevum,</HI> being delivered from death, he shall live and
reign eternally, <HI>Revel. 1. 18. 3. The pleasure of the Lord shall
prosper in his hand;</HI> he shall irresistibly do whatsoever is the Fa∣thers
pleasure to be done in the work of mans salvation. 4. <HI>He
shall see the travel of his soul, and shall be satisfied;</HI> upon this
work done, he fully enjoys the whole of all his desires. 5. <HI>There∣fore
will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide
the spoile with the strong.</HI> He obtains a perfect victory, hath a
plenary and full conquest over every adversary. 2. We yeeld that
the whole of these covenant-transactions; between God and
Christ, was on our behalf. Making his soul an offering for sinne,
he offers it for those that are fallen by iniquity; All is, (as is there
said) for the justification of many. Whatsoeve it is, that upon
the work done redounds to himself, yet the reason of undertaking
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>
was for us, <HI>Vnto us he was borne, unto us he was given, He was
wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, he
was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification;</HI>
He endured the mulct, and we reap the benefit. 3. We confesse
that it is the work of Christ that we enjoy a being in covenant, as
it is his gift that we enjoy the blessing of Ordinances. But when
all these are yeelded, the truth must be asserted, that there is a co∣venant
to which Scripture constantly speaks, which is entred of
God with man, and not with Christ, which me thinks with much
ease might be made to appear.</P>
<P>1. There are frequent testimonies of Gods entry of covenant
with his people. 1. With the leading persons in the covenant,
which stand as the root of many thousand branches, which are
their off-spring in covenant. He entred covenant with <HI>Abraham,
Gen. 15. 18. Gen.</HI> 17. 2. The like he enters with <HI>Isaac,</HI> Gen. 26. 3.
with <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 35. 11. and therefore he is so frequently called
the <HI>God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</HI> And the covenant of
God is alike known by the name of the covenant with <HI>Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob.</HI> 2. He enters covenant with the whole body of the
people of <HI>Israel, Deut. 5. 1, 2. Hear O Israel, the statutes, and judge∣ments,
which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and
keep them, and do them. The Lord our God made a covenant
with us in Horeb, the Lord made not this covenant with our fa∣thers,
but with us, even us who are all of us alive this
day;</HI> And this whole visible body of <HI>Israel</HI> was not
Christ.</P>
<P>2. <HI>There are testimonies of</HI> Israels <HI>entrance into covenant
with God,</HI> Deut. 29. 10, 11, 12. Ye stand this day, all of you before
the Lord your God; your Captaines of your Tribes, your Elders, and
your Officers, with all the men of Israel, your little ones, your wives,
and the stranger that is in thy Camp, from the hewer of thy wood,
unto the drawer of thy water, that thou shouldest enter into covenant
with the Lord thy God, and into his oath which the Lord thy God ma∣keth
with thee this day, <HI>Psalme</HI> 50. 5. Gather my Saints together unto
me, those that have made a Covenant with me by sacrifice, <HI>Deut.</HI>
26. 17. Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to
walk in his ways.</P>
<P>3. The particular time, and place of Gods entrance into cove∣nant
with his people, is, in Seripture noted likewise. In <HI>Horeb</HI> as
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>
we have heard, which was the first yeare of their coming out of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> the third moneth, <HI>Exod</HI> 19. 1. Again, in the fourth year,
the eleventh moneth, the first day, <HI>Deut. 1. 3. Deut.</HI> 29. 10, 11, 12.
compared. <HI>This day</HI> saith the text. Now, there was no day, in
which the covenant of God, with Christ, was entred, no day,
when it was not entred, but it was from all eternity, as, all
the works of the Trinity are, <HI>ad intra.</HI></P>
<P>4. Covenant duties are imposed, to walk before the Lord,
to be <HI>perfect,</HI> to be an <HI>holy, peculiar people,</HI> Gen. 17. 1.
Exod. 19. 6. These are not imposed upon Christ, but upon
Christians.</P>
<P>5. The people of God have the praise of keeping, and are un∣der
the blame of covenant-breaking, which praise of faithfulness,
and blame of perfidiousnesse is ascribed to them, and not to Christ
Jesus.</P>
<P>6. They that have the seals of the covenant given them,
are in covenant; but man receives the Seales, both of
Baptisme and the Lords Supper; as, the people of God of
old, did Circumcision, and the Passeover, therefore, man is in
covenant.</P>
<P>7. If the covenant were made, with Christ, and not with man,
then he is a Mediatour between God and himself, and not between
God and man. This is plain, in that he is the Mediatour of the
covenant, <HI>viz.</HI> between persons in covenant; But he is not a
Mediatiour between God and himself, which were absurd to ima∣gine,
but between God and man, <HI>There is one Mediatour between
God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</HI> 1 Tim. 2. 5.</P>
<P>There is only I think that one difficult text of the Apostle to be
objected against this thing, <HI>Gal. 3. 16. Now to Abraham and his
seed, were the promises made. He saith not, and to seeds, as of many;
but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ,</HI> from whence some
conclude, that the covenant was entred of God, with no other
of <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed, but with Christ, consequently not with man,
but with Christ only. As this was not in my thoughts in my
first Edition, so, I shall not now (as I soon might) weary my
self, and reader, in wading into all the difficulties about it, being
such as have occasioned, not onely the Jewes to insult, as <HI>Calvin</HI>
observes but <HI>Hierom</HI> (the greatest Linguist among the ancients)
to speak words unworthy of such an Apostle, which I shall spare
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
to repeat, and, all, upon the occasion of the Apostles words,
<HI>That the promises, were not made to Abraham, and his seeds, as of
many, but his seed, as of one,</HI> on which the forenamed father says,
<HI>Running over the whole Scripture, both with his eye, and memory;
he doth not finde the word seed ever used in the plural number, but
alwayes in the singular, whether it be in the better, or worse sense.</HI>
But <HI>Gomarus</HI> on the words takes him up as being too short in his
memory, and quotes <HI>Samuels</HI> speech, 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 8. 15. to the contrary,
where the word is used plurally, <HI>Rivet</HI> indeed, <HI>Exercit 108. in
Genes.</HI> seemes to help him out, though he do not mention him,
affirming, that the word [seed] is never used in the plural number,
for the posterity of men; but always collectively used in the sin∣gular
number. The place objected in <HI>Samuel</HI> speaking of the seed
of the earth, but <HI>Ravanellus</HI> on the Apostles behalf, pleads, <HI>That it
is uncertain, whether the word be only used of the Hebrews in the
singular number, for though it be not used plurally, in the Hebrew
Text of the Old Testament, yet it cannot thence be gathered, that
the word hath onely the singular number, and wants the plural;
when it is without all doubt, that all the words which have been in
use with the Hebrews, are not to be found in the Old Testament.</HI>
Howsoever, I am not the man, from whom a satisfying Com∣ment
on these words may be expected; others more able, that
have travelled in it, may be consulted, yet I doubt not, but enough
may be easily said, to vindicate it from this glosse that is here
put upon it, and to make it appear that this text will not bear
this doctrine, that the covenant of grace is not entred with fallen
man, but with Christ only, which may appear by these following
Reasons. 1. There is no safe opposing any one difficult text (a∣bout
which Expositors are at so much difference among them∣selves)
against, so many that are full, and clear against it. The
texts that are against it are (as I may say) without number, and
this, I think, stands alone, with any colour for it. Thus the Pa∣pists
have adventured to fasten their purgatory on 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 13, 14
and some few like difficult places. 2. The word covenant is not in
the text, neither under the more proper word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, nor yet
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; <HI>promises,</HI> in the plural number, re∣peated
again, <HI>verse</HI> 19. in the singular, and a promise, and a
covenant (as <HI>Paraeus</HI> on the words observes) much differ. 3. If
they will needs understand by promises to, a covenant with, as
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
every covenant is a promise, though every promise be not a co∣venant,
they differ as the <HI>Genus</HI> and the <HI>Species,</HI> yet there is that
in the text, (as Master <HI>Bulkley</HI> in his Treatise of the covenant
observes) which makes against them, they say this covenant is
made with Christ, and with none but Christ; but in the text, it is
otherwise, <HI>Abraham</HI> is made a party in the covenant, as well as
Christ, which serves to overthrow their exclusive particle.
4. <HI>[Christ]</HI> here in this place may be taken collectively, as <HI>[seed]</HI>
is usually taken, and so the word is taken, 1 <HI>Cor. 12. 12. As the body is
one, and hath many members, &amp; all the members of that one body, being
many, are one body; so also is Christ.</HI> And so Mr. <HI>Bulkely, Diodati, Ri∣vet,
Gomarus,</HI> and our last Annotations upon the words expound
it. 5. Being understood of Christ personally (which with submission
to better judgements, I confesse most satisfies me) it must not be
understood of Christ, as a party in Covenant, for blessednesse;
but as a Mediatour making blessed. There are many promises
in Scripture made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and
there is much difference among interpreters, to which of these
promises this text refers; The Reader, if he please, may consult
<HI>Paraeus</HI> on the words, and <HI>Junius</HI> in his parallels, but to what text
soever it is, that these words do refer, I am confident that the
Apostle speaks not, of any blessednesse received by covenant; but
a promise of making Nations blessed, and this is not indeed to
[seeds] as of many, but to [seed] as of one, which is Christ;
which I gather by comparing the words in hand with <HI>v.</HI> 8. of the
same chapter, <HI>and the Scripture foreseeing that God would justifie the
Heathen, through faith, preached before the Gospel to Abraham, say∣ing,
In thee shall all Nations be blessed.</HI> This is the promise that
this Text holds out, which is not a covenant for blessednesse, but
a promise to make blessed repeated againe, <HI>verse 19. The Law
was added, because of transgressions till the seed should come, to whom
the promise was made,</HI> which is not Christ, collectively, or mystical∣ly,
but personally considered, not entring covenant but as Medi∣atour
of the covenant. So that this text serves nothing for this
purpose. A learned Writer indeed sayes, <HI>It is beyond my brain
to conceive that God should immediately make a Covenant with us,
who were children of disobedience, and of wrath, who could not be ca∣pable
of any such covenant and conditions.</HI> That Christ hath a
hand to bring us into covenant, before was yeelded, and how far
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
he hath a hand further to carry on; the covenant may be yet fur∣ther
considered, but man is a party in covenant, and as God
may make promises, and give good things to fallen man, so he
may enter covenant with him likewise.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The outward, and not the inward Covenant, is a covenant,
properly so called.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas there is an usual distinction (almost in all that write
or speak of the covenant) of a double covenant between
God and his people, one external, and the other internal; one pas∣sing
outwardly, and the other inwardly kept and observed. Or
(as Dr. <HI>Preston</HI> expresseth it) a single and double covenant, which
I shall forbear to examine, seeing I know there is a right meaning;
though I much doubt whether there be in the Reader a right
understanding. My second Proposition shall be, that <HI>it is the
external Covenant, not the inward, that exactly and properly is cal∣led
by the name of a Covenant: and to which priviledges of Ordi∣nances
and title to Sacraments are annext.</HI> This Proposition, oc∣casioned
by this received distinction, is, of three heads, which
in case the Reader please, he may subdivide into three distinct
Positions.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The outward,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The outward and not the inward Cove∣nant, is pro∣perly a Cove∣nant.</NOTE> <HI>and not the inward Covenant, is, most exactly
and properly called by the name of a Covenant,</HI> which I thus make
good: 1. That covenant to which the definition of a covenant
doth belong, hath exactly and properly the nature of a cove∣nant,
this none can deny: The definition sets out the nature of
the thing defined; But the definition most actly belongs, to the
outward covenant, not to the inward; This is plain; An agree∣ment
of parties, on tearms and Propositions is the definition of
a covenant: Now the outward covenant, is an agreement on
tearmes and Propositions, as I have abundantly declared,
in that covenant God engages himself to man for his happi∣nesse;
and man engages to faith and obedience. The inward
covenant hath no tearmes or Propositions at all, for man to
make good, upon account of his covenanting: seeing the per∣formance
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
of the conditions of the Scripture-covenant, is his very
entrance into the inward covenant. He that believes and repents
keeps covenant, nothing more is expected of God, or promised
by man: But beleeving, and repenting, is the first closing with God
in covenant, according to them that speak of an inward
covenant. 2. A covenant to perform conditions is a covenant
properly so called; But the outward covenant, not the inward,
is a covenant to perform conditions, This is plain: The conditions
in the inward covenant, are the covenant. 3. That which confounds
entrance into covenant, and keeping of covenant, is no covenant
properly so called; In a covenant properly so called these are di∣stinct:
But the inward covenant confounds entrance into cove∣nant
and keeping of covenant, and therefore in exact propriety of
speech is no covenant.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The outward,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The outward Covenant is most usually in Scripture called by the name of Cove∣nant.</NOTE> <HI>and not the inward Covenant, is, most usually in
Scripture, called by the name of a Covenant;</HI> which is plaine,
in that, they that have no part, or portion, in the inward cove∣nant,
are, yet still spoken of, in Scripture, as people in covenant;
God calls all <HI>Israel</HI> his people, and that upon covenant termes;
<HI>Deut. 29. 10▪</HI> 11, 12, 13. Al of those, that thus covenanted with God,
were not in the inward covenant. This people at their worst, and the
wrost among them, are called the people of God, as by those that
were strangers to this covenant: <HI>These are the people of the Lord,</HI>
(say the men of <HI>Babylon) and are gone forth out of his land,</HI> Ezek.
36. 20. so, also by the Lord himself <HI>Jer. 2. 32. Can a Bride forget
her attire? yet my people have forgotten me dayes without number.</HI>
How often doth God own <HI>Israel</HI> as his people, when he yet brands
them as a <HI>rebellious, revolting, stiff-necked, treacherous, and adulte∣rous
people.</HI> They that forsake the covenant of God, that break
covenant, that deale falsely in it, upon whom God brings a
sword to avenge the quarrel of his covenant, are in the outward,
not in the inward covenant: But such there be among Gods
covenant-people, as he frequently complaines, that break cove∣nant,
&amp;c. These, are not then, in his inward, but outward cove∣nant.</P>
<P><HI>The great objection is, (and all that carries colour against
this</HI>) Jer. 31. 32, 33. <HI>where the Lord differencing the Old and
New covenant, saith,</HI> This is the covenant that I will make
with the house of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the house of <HI>Judah:</HI> not according to
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took
them by the hand to bring them out of the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which my
Covenant they brake, although I was an husband to them, saith the
Lord: But this shall be my Covenant that I will make with the
house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put
my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will
be their God, and they shall be my people. <HI>That is alone the in∣ward
covenant, and the elect regenerate are alone within it. The
inward covenant then is called in Scripture a covenant, and is in ex∣act
propriety of speech a covenant.</HI></P>
<P>For answer, I shall have further occasion to speak to
this Text. In this place I shall only put some Que∣ries.</P>
<P>1. Whether those that carry this Text to an unconditionate
covenant, and restrain it alone to that which they call the inward
covenant, do not make the covenant in the time of the Law, and
that in Gospel-times essentially different, and consequently, either
make two covenants of grace, distinct, in kind; or thrust all that
were under the Old covenant, out of all hope of salvation, contra∣ry
to all Interpreters, who make these covenants, one in substance?
See the last larger Annotations on the words.</P>
<P>2. Whether such an Interpretation, do not utterly contra∣dict,
New-Testament-light, which holds out the New covenant in
like latitude with the former, in which many are called, but few
are chosen; and where conditions are as explicitely, and fully re∣quired,
as in Old Testament dispensations?</P>
<P>3. <HI>Whether, when Scripture speaks of things, in opposition
to mens erroneous conceits, (for a further Explanation of
them, and rectifying mens judgements in them) it do usually lay
down a full, compleat, and formal definition, to which nothing is
to be added? or whether it doth not, usually supply that, in
which men through mistake were defective and short? And
whether those Texts,</HI> Esay 58 6, 7. Is not this the fast that I have
chosen, to loose the bands of wickednesse, to undo the heavy burdens,
and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoak? Is it not
to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that
are cast out into thy house, when thou seest the naked, that thou cover
him, and that thou hide not thy self from thy own flesh? <HI>Jer.</HI> 22. 15,
16. Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and judgement,
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
and then it was well with him? He judged the cause of the poor and
needy, and then it was well with him; was not this to know me, saith
the Lord? <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 27. Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the
Father is this, to visit the fatherlesse and widows in their affliction,
and to keep himself unspotted from the world, <HI>are not parallel to
this text in their way of delivery. And in case we cannot finde a
full definition of a religious Fast in that of</HI> Esay, <HI>nor the whole of
it that makes up saving knowledge in that of</HI> Jeremy, <HI>nor the whole
that makes Religion compleat in that of</HI> James; <HI>why is it that we
should earnestly contend, that the full nature of a covenant is
in this text exprest, being fully parallel in the way of delivery to
those other texts.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Men enjoy pri∣viledges of or∣dinances and interest in Sa∣craments upon account of the outward Cove∣nant.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>it is upon the account of the outward Covenant, and not
the inward, that men enjoy priviledges of Ordinances, and interest in
Sacraments;</HI> Men that are so far honoured as to enjoy an outward
covenant, have just title to these priviledges. It is in behalf of
the Jew outwardly that the Apostle having so decryed his con∣dition,
respective to the approbation of God, puts the question,
<HI>What advantage hath the Jew? what profit is there of Circumcision?
Rom.</HI> 3. 1. The Jew and Circumcision are there one; A Jew
outwardly, and circumcision in the flesh, go there in equal
latitude. He that by nature is a Jew (as <HI>Paul</HI> speaks, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 15.)
is of the circumcision; And to these, the Oracles of God are com∣mitted;
<HI>The instruments, deeds and evidences of the covenants,</HI>
say the last Annotations. It was the priviledge of <HI>Israel,</HI> Psal. 147.
19. Rom. 3. and then, the priviledg of no other Nation; Now it is,
the priviledg of all, ingraffed in their stead. This is confest, even
by a great part of those, that understand the inward covenant,
(or covenant keeping to acceptation,) almost whensoever they
mention a covenant, in that, they baptize infants, upon covenant
grounds, even all their infants that make a covenant profession,
and that upon just warranty. It is further plaine in reason, The
outward covenant must have priviledges suitable to it self, other∣wise
there is no manner of benefit, or advantage of it. This pri∣viledge
of the Sacrament is suitable, being outward, as the cove∣nant
is outward; This is elsewhere spoken to at large, and there∣fore
I shall hear forbear.</P>
<P>I have indeed been challenged for this distinction of an outward
and inward covenant, as though I had been the sole Authour of
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
it, when all know that it is a distinction, that of a long time, a∣mong
Divines hath been in common use; and in case it had not
been commonly received, I should have forborne the use of it.
As, I heard <HI>Mr. Ball,</HI> once in discourse, say, that he denyed
any such distinction, of an outward, and an inward call to the Mi∣nistery,
all calling being external, unlesse the man called were
a Prophet, that which men terme, an inward call, being one∣ly
qualifications fitting for the work: So that I deny, in exact pro∣priety
of speech, the inward covenant, is any covenant, but the
answer of the soul, unto that which the covenant requires. And
whereas it is said of me by way of conjecture. <HI>It is probable that
he thus distributes them, from the blessings promised, whereof some
are inward, and some outward; for though he explain not himself
fully, yet I know no other sense that it will bear.</HI> To this I say, that I
thus distinguish them, to apply my self to the Readers understand∣ing,
that hath been accumstomed, so to call them; and further I say,
that men, that barely covenant, and keep not covenant, have
onely priviledges that are outward, They are visible Church-members,
and they have visible Church-priviledges, and those,
who answer to covenant engagements (which usually is called
the inward covenant) have priviledges both outward and in∣ward.
A Jew outwardly had outward priviledges, A Jew inward∣ly
(that is, he that answered to his outward profession, that wor∣shipped
God in spirit) hath both those that were outward and
inward. It is further said, <HI>It is evident that his outward Cove∣nant
hath no seal; for it is a Covenant</HI> de sigillis conferendis; <HI>If there∣fore
it have a seal, it is either the same which is promised, or some other.</HI>
What this Authour means, when he says, it is a covenant <HI>de sigillis
conferendis,</HI> I am to learn; If he mean that the seal follows the co∣venant,
and is put to, after the covenant, so it is in all covenants
whatsoever. He sayes, <HI>they no where tell us, what is the seal of their
outward covenant;</HI> me thinks, we had no need to tell, what the seal
of that covenant was, that the Jew entered; was it not circumcisi∣on?
and did there not another follow, <HI>viz.</HI> the Passeover?
Now I tell him that Circumcision and the Passeover, were, and
Baptisme and the Lords Supper, are, seales of this covenant. The
Nation of the Jewes were in covenant, as our Authour (though he
would, yet) must not deny; They were not all in the inward co∣venant;
and yet they had these seales. He says, we are bound to
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
give the seals to such, <HI>Vocation which is effectual only to bring men
to an outward profession of saving faith, is larger then election, and
makes men such, whom we are bound to baptize;</HI> And such we say
have right to them. And to help him a little further. Those men,
that he sayes the Church must baptize, though without right,
we say, are truely in covenant, and have right; when he knows,
what a childe he is to baptize, he knows, who we say, are in co∣venant,
and have covenant-right to baptisme; so that a second
covenant, of which he speaks, to give right to a first, is a strange
fancy. But seeing I am no better understood, I shall endeavour
(if it may be) to clear my meaning in certain positions which here
follow.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Positions tending to clear the thing in question.</HEAD>
<P>1. <HI>THose that take upon themselves a Christian profession, being
separate for God, calling him by the Name of Lord, that have
Ordinances of God as their inheritance, that acknowledge a Deity, and
no other but the true Deity; a necessity of worship, and none but the
Christian worship, these with me are in Covenant with God,</HI> as was
the whole state of the Church of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the whole face
of the visible Church of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that were ingraffed in
their stead. This to me is plain, in that they are the <HI>Church</HI> or
<HI>Churches</HI> of God, <HI>Act. 7. 8. Gal. 1. 2. The called of God,</HI> Matth.
22. 14. <HI>The people of God,</HI> Isa. 1. 2. Psal. 90. 7. <HI>They sacrific'd
to the true God,</HI> Psal. 50. 7. Are the <HI>sons of God,</HI> Gen. 6. 1. Deut.
14. 1. Rom. 9. 4. Are a people <HI>nigh unto the Lord,</HI> Deut. 4. 7.
Psal. 148. <HI>ult.</HI> God professing himself to be their God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. 7.
Are <HI>children of the Covenant,</HI> Acts 3. 35. <HI>Saints,</HI> Psalme 90. 5.
Acts 26. 10. 1 Cor. 14. 33. <HI>Believers,</HI> Act. 8. 12, 13. Acts 21. 20.
Luke 8. 13. <HI>Disciples,</HI> Matth. 10. 1, 4. Acts 9. 1. &amp; 15. 10.
<HI>Christians,</HI> Acts 11. 26. That all of these imply a covenant-state;
and that unregenerate men, have in Scripture, all this honour, is
clear; These therefore with me are in covenant. I know, that
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
as to all of these elogies, it is answered in a word, that they are
<HI>equivocal.</HI> An answer that I can scarce take into my thoughts
without horrour; as though Gods Oracles were all over, from
one end of the Bible to the other, like those of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and there
were no reality, either in their separation for God, or gifts that
they receive from God, (as illumination, conviction, faith) or
priviledges that they enjoy; When there can be no plain denial,
that all of this here mentioned, argues a covenant-state, yet ex∣ceptions
are taken. <HI>It seemes</HI> (saith one) <HI>he takes all to be in
Covenant that bear the name, [Christian.]</HI> And then questions;
<HI>What? Though they know not what Christ or Christianity is? Is
taking a name, entring into Cevenant? The poore</HI> Indians <HI>that by
thousands are forced by the</HI> Spaniard <HI>to be baptized, are said to know
so little what they do, that some of them forget the name of [a Chri∣stian]
which they assumed.</HI> And does not our Authour think that
a man may take as plausible exceptions against his words, (where
he saith, <HI>The rule is, That a serious professour of the faith is to be taken
for a true beleever,</HI> if he would travel as far as <HI>India</HI> for it,) as he
doth here against Gods Word? Do not we know, that force
may make, these poor <HI>Indians,</HI> to appear serious in their profession?
And it is wonder, that it should be so strange with him, that ta∣king
a name, should be entring covenant, or at least that it
should imply a covenant-state: Let him consult <HI>Isa. 4. 1. In that
day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, we will eat our
own bread, and wear our own apparel; onely let us be called by thy
name to take away our reproach;</HI> and those manifold Scripture-Texts,
which expresse the relation of Gods covenant-people to him,
in these words, <HI>A people called by his Name;</HI> or <HI>on whom the
Name of God is called.</HI> Distinction should be put, between chil∣dren
of the covenant, by descent from parents in covenant, whe∣ther
Jews or Christians, (who continue their covenant-relation,
till they professedly cast it off, notwithstanding their ignorance)
and such that of meer aliens are to be received, having no other
title then their own present qualification. This ought to be vo∣luntary,
as well, in renouncing their old false way, as embracing
the present, as we see it was, in those coverts through the <HI>Acts</HI> of
the Apostles, and, is not to be, without some competency of know∣ledge,
discerning the evil of their former course, and the happinesse
attainable in the present. And, I am easily induced to believe,
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
that more knowledge by the industry of teachers, is now required,
then was in the primitive times, seeing there is not so much of God,
by miracle to perswade, and as it were to over-rule: So that it is
not a naked taking of a name that is intended, but that which toge∣ther
with it still attends upon it: As a wife is called by her husbands
name, and withall, makes her abode in his house; so it is with a Co∣venant
people, and was with <HI>Israel;</HI> They bore the name of God,
and they made abode in the Church of God, enjoying his
Ordinances as their inheritance. It is objected, <HI>God oft bestowes
his Word on Infidels, and in England there are men that de∣ride
the truth of Scripture, and esteem it a fiction, and yet for credit
of men come ordinarily to the Congregation. These have the Word
given, and so have other unregenerate men, but not by Covenant that
I know of,</HI> That God doth bestow his Word on Infidels, to me is
strange: It is true that he often tenders it to them, but in case they
remain Infidels, they put it away from them, and bestowing implies
not only a tender but an acceptance. It was the great advantage
of <HI>Israel,</HI> above other Nations, that to them was committed the O∣racles
of God, when others had not that honour. And to speak,
of Gods giving his Word by Covenant, is a most improper speech,
seeing the Word is the very Covenant draughts; as though
we should say, he gives his Word, by his Word. And these
sure are no open deriders that for the credit ofmen, make such a
publique profession: this would work restraint, on the one hand,
as it puts upon profession on the other. And in case any such
thing be, though the Covenant is perfidiously broke, yet (as I
conceive) it is not totally cast off, as long as an open profession is
continued. What shall we say of those, that take their sons, and
daughters, to give them to <HI>Moloch?</HI> this can be no low crime, and is
an high departure from the true God, yet these bring forth chil∣dren
unto God; and they are Gods children, that they thus sa∣crifice,
<HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 20, 21. So also, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106. 35, &amp;c. <HI>Israel was
mingled among the Heathen, and learned their works, and they ser∣ved
their Idols, which were a snare to them; yea, they sacrificed their
sons and daughters unto Devils, and shed innocent blood, even the
blood of their sons and daughters;</HI> Yet this, as appears cast them not
out of Covenant; God notwithstanding <HI>remembred for them
his Cavenant,</HI> ver. 45. This was therefore doubtlesse but a par∣tial
apostasie; Taking in the worship of Idols, they did not to∣tally
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
cast off the worship of God: God was not totally cast off
in <HI>Judah,</HI> neither did God cast off <HI>Judah: Ahaz</HI> was of the
worst of Kings, and yet his posterity was reckoned among
the people of the Lord. Had the <HI>Jews</HI> at that time been, as se∣vere
disputants against a covenant-state, as are risen up now, the
Church of God had wanted an <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> He had never lived,
(much lesse wrought so happy a Reformation) in the Church of
God.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Those that are lookt upon by men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Posit. 2.</NOTE> <HI>as in Covenant with God,
and so ordinarily judged (as the people of Israel were) by the Name
that they bear, their abode in the Church, the profession that they
make, and so accordingly stiled, are truely, and really in Cove∣nant.</HI>
A man may know a man, to appertain to such, or such a
person, because he sees him in his family, hears him call him
<HI>Master,</HI> sees him, sometimes at least, in his work, and knows,
him to have the repute of his servant; Though to know him to
be a faithful servant, requires more diligence of enquiry, and a
stricter scrutiny: So, a man may be as easily known, to apper∣taine
to Jesus Christ; The same Characters make him known,
all that is required, to being in covenant, is, visible, open, evi∣dent:
but sincerity of heart in covenanting is invisible, and se∣cret.
And therefore the Jew outwardly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 28. is called
by the <HI>Vulgar, Vatablus, Tremelius, Arias Montanus,</HI> and <HI>Casta∣lio,
Judaeus in manifesto;</HI> by <HI>Calvin, Judaeus in aperto;</HI> by <HI>Beza,
Judaeus in propatulo:</HI> The Jew inwardly, is called <HI>Judaeus in abscon∣dito,</HI>
or <HI>occulto:</HI> Their Church, or covenant-station, giving them
those great advantages after mentioned, was open and manifest.
Those that say, <HI>Lord, Lord,</HI> as, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 21. are of those that a∣vouch
God to be their God, and God avoucheth them to be his
people. And therefore when they come with their sacrifices,
though in their sinnes, and God upon that account testifies against
them; yet he sayes, <HI>I am God, even thy God.</HI> It is confess'd by an e∣minent
adversary, that <HI>we must judge those that make profession, to
be in Covenant with God: we must give them the name of Christians,
and men in covenant with God, and we must use them as Christians in
works of Charity and Ordinances, and Church-communion, and so
must use their children as Christians children.</HI> And seeing reason
to judge so, according to Scripture-character of men in cove∣nant,
they are so. Either in this we judge right, or else we pro∣ceed
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
upon mistake, If we judge aright, then all is well: If we
mistake, then, all in these proceedings is null. Water hath been
applyed to the child of such an one, but no Sacrament dispens'd;
and according to a mans hopes, thoughts or feares of his fathers
regeneration, are his hopes, thoughts and feares of his own bap∣tisme,
and consequently of his interest in Church-communion;
for this, stands, or falls according to his fathers interest, or non∣interest
in the covenant. A grand Rule is laid down by the said
Authour, <HI>That a serious Professour of the faith is to be taken for a
true Beleever:</HI> and this being laid down, more are added. If this
Proposition were a Scripture-Maxime then it would have borne a
farther superstruction, but, being neither found there, nor any
proof made, that it is any way deduced thence, mother and daugh∣ters,
may all justly be called into question, and seeing he can∣not
but know, that very many (as to the thing for which it is pro∣duc'd
(which in order to admission to Ordinances) will utterly
deny it, he might have dome well to have made some essay to
have proved it. I do yeeld that charity is to hope the best, but
but that we should put our charity to it, or our reason either,
for probability or certainty, when we no where so taught,
and have a more sure rule for our proceeding, I see no reason.
I can scarce meet with a Minister that sayes, (and I have put
the question to many of the most eminent that I know) that he
baptizeth any infant upon this ground of hope that the parent is
regenerate, but still with earnest vehemence professes the
contrary. I desire the Reader to consider Master <HI>Cobbets</HI>
third and fourth Conclusions in his just Vindication, <HI>page

<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
the practise thereof. It were a sad case for Ministers, if they were
bound to admit none, or administer the Lords Supper to none, but
such as were truly godly; or that they judged in their conscience
to be so, or were bound to eject all that they judged were not
so.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Mans obligation of himself in covenant unto God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Posit. 3.</NOTE> <HI>upon the
termes by him proposed, necessarily implies Gods obligation to man.</HI>
Where God makes tender of the Gospel, by his Ministers to any
one out of covenant, there he makes tender of the Covenant;
and where a person, or people, professedly accept, that is, engage
themselves, (as myriads of thousands did through the <HI>Acts of
the Apostles</HI>) this person, this people, each man of them is in
covenant. As Scripture calls them by the name of <HI>Saints, Dis∣ciples,
Beleevers, Christians,</HI> so we may call them <HI>Covenanters.</HI>
They have all a sanctity of separation, which <HI>Camero</HI> sayes, is real,
and arguments are drawn from thence to a right in Baptisme,
There is in most of them, if not in all, some graces that are real;
either common or saving, and a covenant doth not wait, till the
termes be kept, and the conditions made good, before it hath the
being of a covenant. And whether these be every way sincere, or a∣ny
way dissembling, yet it is acknowledged, that they really oblige
themselves: And God howsoever dissembles not, but is bound by
himself, upon his own terms, which they profedly accept, to confer
all that the covenant holds forth, so that, wheresoever man is ob∣liged,
there a compleat covenant is made up, for Gods tender
goes before, and man is the last party, and compleats the Cove∣nant.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Sinceri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Posit. 4.</NOTE> <HI>and integrity of heart; or fully reality, in a mans
intentions, to stand to the whole of a Covenant, is not of the offence,
and being of it.</HI> Both parties stand engaged, upon their respective
termes, though one part should have unsincere intentions. A
wife is a wise, and the marriage is compleat, when both parties
have publickly express'd consent though she hold a resolution
to be stubborn, refractory, profuse, &amp;c. A man consenting to
serve, whether in bare words, or taking earnest, as is most usual,
or by hand and seal, as in the case of apprentices, is a servant
although he intend with <HI>Onesimus</HI> to purloyn, or take his oppor∣tunity
to be gone. Some thinks it makes for their advantage,
to say, that unregenerate men are unsincere in covenant; but that
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
concession, utterly destroys them. If they be unsincere, or as
the Psalmist speaks, not stedfast in covenant, then they are in
covenant, <HI>A propositione secundi adjacentis, ad propositionem primi
adjacentis, valet argumentum.</HI> If it be true that <HI>Catiline</HI> is a se∣ditious
man, then it is true, that he is a man: that <HI>Peribomius</HI>
is a vicious man, then he is a man; that <HI>Judas</HI> is treacherous and
perfidious in covenant, then he is in covenant: A mans conviction,
that he is an unjust steward, or an unfaithful servant, doth not
conclude him to be no servant, or no steward, but the contrary.
And whereas it is said, <HI>The differences must be taken notice of, be∣tween
humane Covenants, and ours with God; or else all will be marred.
Men know not one another hearts, and therefore make not laws for
hearts, nor impose conditions on hearts: and therefore if both parties do
confesse consent, though dissembledly, they are both obliged, &amp; the Cove∣nant
is mutual. But God offers to consent only on condition that our hearts
consent to his terms, and therfore if we profess, consent, &amp; do not consent,
God consenteth not, nor is, as it were, obliged.</HI> This were somewhat
to purpose, in case it could be made to appear that Scripture de∣nies
all being of a covenant between God and man, where the
all-seeing eye of God sees not all integrity and sincerity. But
Scripture-language which is the fasest for us to follow, being
(as we have heard) far otherwise, there is nothing marr'd in non∣observance
of any such supposed difference; See <HI>Psal. 78. 34, 35, 36.
When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned, and
enquired early after God. And they remembred that God was their
Rock, and the High God their Redeemer. Neverthelesse they did
flatter him with their mouth: and they lied unto him with their
tongues.</HI></P>
<P>5. <HI>There is a real and serious purpose in many unregenerate per∣sons
to serve the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Posit. 5.</NOTE> <HI>and to come up to as much as they think he in
covenant requires,</HI> though with <HI>Austin</HI> they have a great mind to
delay, and often to put off, the thought of, their more exact, and
serious service; and too ordinarily think that they keep cove∣nant,
when they break it, having not as yet any right know∣ledge,
either of their own hearts, or Gods commands, and
in this posture, in which they thus stand, before they come up any
higher, yea, though they never come higher, they reach unto
graces in themselves real, true, and good, and all do, the works
which God commands; <HI>There is a common grace which is not sa∣ving,
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
yet real, and so true, and good, and so true grace, as well as
special grace which is saving,</HI> saith Master <HI>Baxter Saints everlast∣ing
Rest,</HI> Part. 3. Sect. 6. Which may be a faire answer to that
which is objected against me, that in my <HI>explication of Dogmatical
faith, I adde by way of exclusion [though not affecting the heart to a
full choice of Christ] where he seems</HI> (saith my adversary) <HI>to imply,
though he expresse it not, that the faith that he meaneth doth affect the
heart to a choice of Christ which is not full. But if so, then, 1. It is
much more then assent, or a meer Historical, Dogmatical Faith.
2. But is the choice, which he intimateth real as to the act, and suited
to the object? That is, the real choice of such a Christ as is offered,
and on such termes? If so, it is justifying faith: If not, either it is
counterfeit, as to the act, or but nominal, as to the object, and is indeed
no choosing of Christ.</HI> That which is real and true, is neither coun∣terfeit
nor meerly nominal, so far as they know, either Christ or
their own hearts, they undissembledly choose, and take to him, as
expecting to be happy in him, and not in any other object;
though too often it is upon mis-information, and when they
come to a right understanding of the termes, they are in danger
to quit the way in which they might enjoy him. It is further
said <HI>That, I think that there may be an undissembled profession,
which yet may not be of a saving faith; But then I conceive,</HI>
saith one, <HI>it is not an entire profession of the whole essential object of
Christian faith,</HI> viz. <HI>of assent and consent.</HI> In which he doth but
cast dust in his Readers eyes, in confounding the intirenesse of
the object, and the integrity of the subject. There may be an
entire profession of the whole essential object of faith, where
the will is brought in to make no more full choice, or consent
then hath been said, and the desired integrity of the subject
wanting; I am told, <HI>It will be an hard saying to many honest Chri∣stians,
to say that a man not justified may believe every fundamen∣tal
article, and withal truly professe repentance of all his sinnes,
and to take God for his Sovereign to rule him, and his chief good
to be enjoyed to his happinesse, and to take Christ for his Lord,
and only Saviour, and his Word for his Law and Rule, and the
Holy Ghost for his guide and Sanctifer, and the rest which is essen∣tial
to Christianity.</HI> I think it will be nothing hard for any ho∣nest
Christian to say, that a man not justified, may believe every
fundamental article, as to assent, and that he may be convinc'd
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
of the necessity of such repentance, and accordingly to make
profession of it, as <HI>Johns</HI> converts (who were not all justifi'd)
did, and were baptiz'd into it, or that such an one may free∣ly
yeeld, that God hath right of Sovereignty and rule, and that
he is the chief good to be enjoyed for happinesse, and that
he ought to take Christ for his Lord, and Saviour, &amp;c. and
that this may be done truly, not only as to reality of assent,
but as to reality of purpose to make this choice, so farre
as the man knows his own heart, or the minde of God in this
work, though there be not that integrity, to yeeld up himself
wholly, which yet by the power of Ordinances through the
Spirit, in Gods time may be done, and through grace per∣fected.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Posit. 6.</NOTE> God setting up a visible Church upon earth, in order to that
which is invisible, will have those admitted, that give assent to Scri∣pture-doctrine,
and accordingly wake profession: <HI>And this, of it
self</HI> in fero Dei, <HI>brings them into covenant-right, and visible
Church-membership. And therefore according to the minde of
God (and, as</HI> Apollonius <HI>speaks,</HI> jure Dei <HI>in this estate) are to be
received, Though they shall hit, or misse of the mercy of the
covenant, accordingly, as by grace they come up to, or by sin fall
short of the Propositions contained in it.</HI> A Scholar (<HI>saith
Mr.</HI> Hudson) that is admitted into a School, is not admitted because
he is <HI>doctus,</HI> but, <HI>ut sit doctus;</HI> and if he will submit to the rules
of the Schoole, and apply himself to learne, it is enough for his ad∣mission.
The like may be said of the Church-visible which is Christs
School; Vindicat. <HI>pag.</HI> 248. The door of the visible Church,
(<HI>saith Master</HI> Baxter, Saints Rest. <HI>Part. 4. Sect.</HI> 3.) is in∣comparably
wider then the door of heaven; and Christ is so tender,
so bountiful, and forward to convey his grace, and the Gospel so free an
offer, and invitation to all, that surely Christ will keep no man off:
if they will come quite over in spirit to Christ, they shall be welcome:
if they will come but onely to a visible profession, he will not deny them
admittance. <HI>This seems to me to speak the mind of Jesus Christ for
their admittance, and that</HI> in foro Dei, <HI>as well as</HI> in foro Ecclesiae,
<HI>they stand in covenant-relation, and have title to Church-member∣ship.
Thus the Reader may see my thoughts in this thing; and
though I doubt not, but that some will question much that I have
said; yet now at last, I hope, my meaning may be understood.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Covenant of Grace calls for Conditions
from Man.</HEAD>
<P>A Third Proposition which I shall here lay down,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Grace calls for conditions from man.</NOTE> is, <HI>that
Gods covenant with man hath its restipulation from man, when
God engages to man, to conferre happinesse upon him, he requires con∣ditions
from him.</HI> This I know hath strong opposition by men
of two sorts, and they of different stamps, and for different
ends. The first deny all Gospel-conditions, all covenant-termes
on mans part, to the end they may assert justification be∣fore,
and without Faith, Salvation without Repentance, and Obe∣dience,
which though it be contradicted by abundant testimonies
of Scripture (placing unbeleeving, impenitent and disobedient
ones in hell: under the wrath of God, yea such unbeleeving, im∣penitent
ones that have laid highest claime to Christ, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.
23.) yet it seems wholly to follow, and necessarily to be evinced
from this absolute unconditionate covenant. If Christ have whol∣ly
finished, not only the work of mans redemption, but also of
his salvation upon the crosse, without farther work of applica∣tion
(as one in a distinct Treatise hath made it his endeavour to
prove) then we may, as he there doth, decry, both our faith in
Christ, and Christs intercession for us. Herein one of late (ac∣cording
to his wonted weaknesse) is very industrious, and whereas
the Scripture tells us, <HI>Christ dwells in our hearts by Faith,</HI> Ephes.
3. 17. he would prove, that Christ enters into us, without us, dwells
in the unbeleeving, and in reference to this opinion of his, he
makes it his businesse, as, to deny Faith, in reference to Justificati∣on,
so, all Gospel-covenant-conditions. <HI>All other covenants
besides this were</HI> (saith he) <HI>upon a stipulation, and the pro∣mise
was altogether upon conditions on both sides. But in this cove∣nant
of Grace,</HI> viz. <HI>the new covenant, it is far otherwise, there is
not any condition in this covenant, I say the new covenant is without
any condition whatsoever.</HI> And he further tells his hearers, that
<HI>he is on a nice point, Faith is not the condition of the covenant.</HI> O∣thers,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
utterly distasting the aforenamed opinions, of Justification
without faith, or salvation without obedience, or repentance
(which seeme to be the natural issue and necessary consequents of
an unconditional covenant,) yet, with great resolution do affirme;
the covenant to be without conditions, joyning in the premisses
with these heterodox teachers, but peremptorily denying the con∣clusion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for a conditional Covenant.</NOTE>
Against both of these that oppose it, either more despe∣rately,
or more innocently, I affirm (and might quote a cloud of
witnesses) that the covenant of grace hath its conditions; which
to me is clear.</P>
<P>First, by the definition of a covenant, given in, by the Authour
before named, a few pages before his assertion before mentioned.
<HI>It is a mutual agreement, between parties, upon certaine Articles
or Propositions, on both sides, so that each party is bound and tyed to
perform his own conditions.</HI> It is in the definition and of the essence
of a covenant in general (according to him) to have conditions,
yet this covenant in particular, with him, is without condition;
Here is a <HI>species,</HI> that partakes not of the nature of the <HI>genus,</HI> a
particular covenant that wants the essence of a covenant, which is
the same as though he should finde us a man that is no living
creature, a Vine or Fig-tree that is no plant, a piece of scarlet
of no colour; such a thing is this unconditional covenant. If the
essence of a covenant require it, then this covenant is not with∣out
it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly by the expresse Texts of Scripture, which lay down
conditions of the covenant, either in expresse words, or those
that of necessity imply a condition. See</HI> John 8. 51. Verily, verily,
I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
<HI>Who sees not there; First, a Priviledge granted by way of co∣venant.
Secondly, the condition on which it is to be obtained.</HI>
John 8. 24. If ye beleeve not that I am he, ye shall die in your sinnes.
<HI>Heb.</HI> 3. 6. Whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and
the rejoycing of the hope firme unto the end. <HI>Who knows not,</HI> If, <HI>to
be a conditional particle? All pardon and justification (if Scri∣pture
may be heard) is suspended on mens not beleeving,</HI> John
3. 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever beleeveth on him should not perish, but have everlasting
life. <HI>Mar.</HI> 16. 16. He that beleeveth, and is baptized, shall be saved;
and he that beleeveth not, shall be damned.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35"/>
Thirdly, by Analogy with the covenant of Works, entred
of God with <HI>Adam</HI> in innocency, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 17. This, on all
hands that (I know), is granted to have been conditional,
and who sees not in the Texts mentioned, conditions as ex∣presse
in the Gospel, as <HI>not eating of the tree of knowledge of good
and euil,</HI> to man in Paradise? either, both, or neither, must be
conditional.</P>
<P>Fourthly, from the nature of conditions in covenants. A
condition in a covenant, is somewhat agreed upon by the Parties
in covenant, upon performance of which the benefit of the cove∣nant
is obtained, and upon the failing of it, the whole benefit is
lost, and the penalty, whatsoever it is, incurred. In covenants be∣tween
equals, either indent, and article what those conditions
shall be upon defaylance of which the benefit is lost, and the
penalty incurred. In covenants between superiour and inferiour,
the superiour doth prescribe, and the inferiour doth yeeld. In all
covenants there are such conditions, that upon performance or
failing of them, the covenant doth stand or fall: such there are in
the Gospel-covenant. There we are enjoyned to believe and re∣pent,
upon obedience to and performance of these, we reap the
benefit of the covenant. Upon failing in them the benefit is lost, and
the penalty incurred. <HI>He that beleeveth not, shall be damned. Ex∣cept
ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI> There are then conditions
in this covenant.</P>
<P>Fifthly, from the absurdities that will follow upon the denial
of conditions on mans part in the covenant. First, then man is
out of danger of being faulty in the covenant, he can be no co∣venant-breaker▪
He cannot be charged that his heart is unsteady
in it. This of it self is plaine, He that is tyed to nothing, fails in
nothing; he that is engaged to no servce, neglects no service; As
God hath that glory that he keeps covenant, so man hath that
Priviledge, that he is not in a capacity of breaking of it. The
Church might have spared that Apology for themselves, <HI>that they
had not dealt falsely in the covenant,</HI> Psal. 44. 17. seeing they were
under no such engagement, that they could falsifie, or in any such
capacity of being false; but we finde God complaining against
his People for breach of covenant, <HI>Jerem. 11. 10. Isa. 24. 5.
Psal.</HI> 78. 10, 37. we finde him giving out his threats to avenge
the quarrel of his covenant, <HI>Levit.</HI> 26. 25. Master <HI>Baxters</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
Questionist (who seems contrarily minded) thought it an excepti∣on
of validity, <HI>That it follows from his doctrine, that the New cove∣nant
is never violated by any.</HI> I am sure it follows from this do∣ctrine,
that it is not in any capacity of violation. Secondly, then
we may say (as the Apostle in another case) <HI>Our preaching is in
vain,</HI> at least to salvation vaine, the Gospel in mans mouth
is no power of God to salvation. In faith or unbelief, in a pe∣nitent
or unrepentant condition, in holinesse or disobedience,
God will save; he looks neither at faith, uprightnesse, or any
qualification, when in a covenant-way he engages himselfe to
conferre salvation. In case God doth not regard it, to what
end is there any paines to work a people to it? This I know some
Assertours of this doctrine will disclaime, but let them shew how
they will avoid it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A grand Objection against this doctrine answered.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HEre an objection of weight;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A grand obje∣ction against the conditio∣nality of the Covenant of Grace answer∣ed.</NOTE> <HI>by reason of the difficulty of
some Scripture-Texts, on which it is grounded, is to be
taken into consideration,</HI> It is true (<HI>saith one</HI>) that in cove∣venants
usually there is a mutual contract, and there are mutual per∣formances,
to which persons are engaged thereby. But for the thing
it is certaine, that however the words of <HI>foedus pactum,</HI> in Latine,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greek, covenant in English be used, the Hebrew <HI>Be∣rith,</HI>
and the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, used in the Old and New Testament,
do not alwayes import a mutual contract and mutual performances.
God is said to establish a Covenant with all living, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. 9, 10.
between whom and God, there neither is, nor can be a mutual con∣tract
and performance. And the term rendred covenant, is not on∣ly
rendred Testament; but also the holy Writers do illustrate the
New covenant, rather by the metaphor of a Testament, then of a
covenant, 1 <HI>Corinth. 11. 25. Gal. 3. 15. Heb.</HI> 9. 16, 17. and
where the Promises are set down without any reciprocal contract
or duty exprest, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 10, 11, 12. and 10. 16, 17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.
26, 27.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36"/>
This argument, is against all being of covenants, as well as the
conditionality of them, as indeed, if conditions be denied, all be∣ing
of a covenant is destroyed, and therefore it might have
been well brought in, where the covenant it self was asserted, as
militating against the very being of it. But it cannot conveni∣ently
be held out in both places, and therefore it must be con∣sidered
here, and for answer, let us first take what is granted,
that usually in covenants there is a mutual contract, and that
these words, Latine, and Greek, be used to imply such covenants,
in which there are mutual contracts, and mutual performances, and
to which persons are engaged on both sides; and then let us exa∣mine
what is affirmed concerning those two words, <HI>Berith</HI> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for the contrary.</P>
<P>And for the first, who does not know, that the word is some∣times
used for a covenant improperly so called? A bare command,
<HI>Jer.</HI> 34. 13. A bare Seal, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 10. is (as we have heard) called a
covenant. And, so a bare promise here in the place quoted is cal∣led
a covenant likewise; Not that beasts and birds can covenant,
but they shall be as secure from the judgement there mentioned,
as though there had past a mutual contract in the strongest en∣gagements,
<HI>Eliphaz</HI> shewing the priviledges of the godly, saith;
Job 5. 23. <HI>They shall be in league with the stones of the field,</HI> the same
word is in both places; shall we now say, that a league or cove∣nant
is no act of reason, because man is in league and covenant
with stones, which are unreasonable creatures? or rather shall we
say with Master <HI>Caryl</HI> in his <HI>Exposition, To be in League with stones is
an improper and allusive speech, stones are not capable of the formalities
of a League?</HI> So we say, for God to make a covenant with unrea∣sonable
creatures, with beasts, birds, and creeping things, is an im∣proper
and allusive speech likewise. Birds, Beasts, and creeping
things are in an incapacity of covenant. <HI>Gomarus</HI> handling that

that those words containe the forme of a
covenant; because <HI>it is certain</HI> (as he sayes)
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
<HI>that a Covenant properly so called, containes an obligation of two
parties, with conditions on both sides; which cannot be proved</HI> (saith
he) <HI>in those words, and therefore it is not a covenant properly so cal∣led.</HI>
From which learned hand we see 1. That a covenant properly
so called is of two parties. 2. That both parts have their condi∣tions.
3. That there is a covenant between God and man pro∣perly
so called, in which God and man are both obliged. 4. That
no Scripture-expression holds out this covenant▪ that holds not
out these conditions.</P>
<P><HI>This is the proper acception for which we contend, and im∣proper
acceptions as they do not hold forth the nature of a cove∣nant,
so we confesse they do not imply mutual contracts, or mu∣tual
performances. So that the Argument is brought to this,
A covenant sometimes in an improper sense is said to be made
with those that cannot make mutual contracts; therefore a cove∣nant
is no mutal contract, nor hath any mutual engagements.
We might as well argue, that because a stone is called a witnesse,</HI>
Josh. 24. 27. <HI>a heap of stones is so called,</HI> Gen. 31. 48. (<HI>which have
neither eyes, nor ears, to see or hear, what is done or said, nor yet
a tongue to utter it) therefore there is no use of eyes, or ears, or
of a tongue, in any one that is brought for a witnesse. As the He∣brew
word</HI> Berith <HI>is improperly used, or at least used in a sense,
more large then to denote a covenant, wheresoever it doth not
hold out an agreement of two parties with engagements on both
hands. So the word</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>whensoever it is used in that sense,
seemes to be taken improperly, Seeing in its received signification
(according to good Interpreters) it doth denote not a covenant,
but a mans last Will and Testament, which never is of force, but by
the death of the Testator,</HI> Heb. 9. 16, 17. <HI>which is not true of a Co∣venanter,
his death is not required to make
the covenant valid.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><P>Testamentum Grace <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> su∣mitur,</P>

was put to it, to keep the Greek word, and put it into a
Syriack Character. For the clearing of this doubt, it is not

God: and if satisfaction for them, then to under-lie the curse of the Law
for them, and so to die.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Foedus N.

upon the promised death of the Son of God, and an heavenly inheritance
by it, so that it may not unworthily be called a Testamentary covenant,
or a Testament-covenant, by reason of the concurrence of both in one.
And after concludes, Simply it is a covenant by reason of the mutual
agreement between God and beleevers; Respectively a Testament, by
reason of the way, and manner of the chief and most eminent part in the
covenant, that is the promise of grace, whereby God promiseth to be
our God propitious to us, and to give us everlasting life, as an inheri∣tance
by the death of his Son.</P>

a remedy (with me) worse then the disease, though learned Mr.

latitude the word <HI>Berith</HI> is taken: <HI>The Apostle</HI> (he saith) <HI>shewes
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>
the limitation of it out of the Types and shadows of the Law in the
fifteenth, and following verses when he shews that the grace of God,
was herein more eminent and conspicuous, in that he gave unto his,
not a covenant, but a Testament, giving in his reasons; because a cove∣nant
must have contained mutual conditions, which if either part did
not performe, the covenant were void; but a Testament is an in∣strument
of liberality and bounty, by which men are called and made
heirs without eying of any duty that is to be done by them.</HI> Here
by the way we see that in case it be a covenant (according to him)
it hath mutual conditions, and therefore he is (together with
<HI>Ravanellus, Gomarus, Vrsinus</HI> before quoted, to whom may be
added <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> on <HI>Judg.</HI> 2. giving the like definition)
wholly against those who make this inference; <HI>That it cannot be
proved to be of the general nature of covenants, that there should be
such a convertibility, as that both must seal or contract or perform.</HI>
But for his position that God hath not given a covenant to his
people, I wonder how it slipt from him; Such unwary expressions
(in a seeming tendency to advance grace from pious persons)
have made way for strange superstructions. He might have said,
that those Types and Shadows of the Law, did argue it to be more
then a bare and common covenant, being ratified by blood,
which led to the blood of the Mediatour. And so <HI>Rivet</HI> (as I un∣derstand
him) answers,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Non hoc vo∣luit Paulus in Epistola ad He∣braeos, <HI>cap.</HI> 9. ex simplici vocis significatione arguere, sed ex ipsius foederis circumstantiis.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Hebr.</HI> (saith
he) chap. 9. <HI>doth not argue from the simple signification of the word,

be a covenant, is that which I must oppose. He is large indeed
to shew in what latitude the word <HI>Berith</HI> in some Old Testa∣ment
Texts is used, as also the Latine word <HI>Foedus</HI> in prophane
Authors; All of which, shews no more but that the word in the
exact denotation and largest sense of it imports no more then an ordination
or disposition, yet that hinders not, but that as,
Interpreters generally render it, so, the received and accustomed
use of it, is, to hold out a covenant, bargaine, or agreement. As
the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in its largest sense, comprizes any Assembly,
even for civil uses, <HI>Acts</HI> 19. 39. yea, rude congregated routs,
<HI>verse</HI> 41. yet in the generally received sense, it is taken for holy
Assemblies; So, it is with <HI>Berith;</HI> the word may admit of a
large sense, but the received sense is with more restriction. The
Jews had their covenants, man with man, <HI>Abraham</HI> with <HI>Abi∣melech,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="39"/>
Gen. 21. 72. <HI>Isaac</HI> with <HI>Abimelech,</HI> Gen. 26. 28. <HI>Laban</HI>
with <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 31. 44. And this was the word whereby they
did expresse their covenants, And as, the word Church is some∣times
used improperly, for Church Members that make not up
a whole Church, <HI>The Church in</HI> Aquila <HI>and</HI> Priscilla<HI>'s house,</HI> Rom.

no competent judges: so, there are improper acceptions of the
word covenant, when the proper sense is that, which hath been
held out, which is a mutual compact or agreement on terms and
Propositions. The learned observe that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> properly answers

which (saith he) <HI>is the proper signification of the Hebrew word</HI> Berith,
<HI>which word is not read in the Old Testament, for the ordering of a
mans Will or Testament.</HI> Now it is not denyed, but the word
<HI>foedus</HI> and <HI>pactum</HI> in Latine, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greek, <HI>covenant</HI> in
English, do signifie mutual contracts, in which there are mu∣tual
performances; and so the Hebrew word <HI>Berith</HI> in like
manner; this being according to the learned the genuine
signification of it. And if this were not the received signifi∣cation
of it, how did the Objection before mentioned ever
come into any mans head, that the Apostle did bewray ignorance
in the Scripture-use of the word, in applying it to a mans Will or
Testament, and what needed so much pains for his defence in it?
<HI>Hierome</HI> on those words, <HI>Gal 3. 17. This I say, that the Testa∣ment
confirmed of God,</HI> saith, <HI>If any compare the Hebrew volumes
and other Editions with the translation of the Septuagint, he shall
find, that, where Testament is written, it doth not signifie a Testa∣ment,
but a Covenant, which in the Hebrew tongue is called</HI> Berith.
And in case Gods whole dispensations and Gospel-communicati∣ons
(as <HI>Junius</HI> would have it) be a Testament onely, and no co∣venant;
why is the world so abused with the word <HI>foedus, pactum</HI>
in Latine, covenant in English? By which all men understand
that which we call a covenant, no man understands a Testament;
why do we say covenant of Works, covenant of grace, if the
<PB N="43" REF="39"/>
former onely were a covenant properly, and the other a Testament?
as though we should cal, an Eagle, and a Lion both by the common
name of a bird, perswading that a Lion were a bird, as well as an Ea∣gle?
yet if it were a Testament properly so called, it would not over∣throw
the conditionality, as Mr. <HI>Grayl</HI> out of <HI>Swynborn</HI> shews. Te∣staments
have their conditions, How comes it to pass that Scripture
holds out so frequently that similitude of a marriage, <HI>Is. 54. 5. Hos.
2. 19. 2 Cor. 11. 2. Eph.</HI> 5. 32. to set out this transaction? A marriage
contract is not a mans Testament: hath a wife barely a Legacie,
and doth she enter no covenant with her husband? How comes
it to passe that turning aside from God, after other lovers, is
called in Scripture by the name of whoredomes, adulteries, which
is the breach of a marriage-covenant? and how is sin against God,
called a dealing falsely with God? we cannot deale falsely in the
covenant, if it be not a covenant, but a Testament; men may
carry themselves unthankfully, but falsehood argues an engage∣ment.
How is it that we finde, in Old and New Testament-Scrip∣tures,
mutuall engagements, between God and his people; of God
to them, of them to him, in case God hath vouchsafed them a
Legacie by Testament, in the death of his Son, and left them out
of covenant? And how is that, without Covenant, without
Christ, without God, without Hope, with the Apostle are one and
the same, when yet all people that have hope in Christ are out of
covenant? There be that say, <HI>The holy Writers do illustrate the New
covenant, rather by the Metaphor of a Testament, then a covenant.</HI>
These seeme to make it neither a Covenant nor a Testament. E∣very
one knows that a Metaphor is a figure, whereby a word is
carried out of its proper signification into some other that carries
resemblance with it. In case there be a metaphor in that expres∣sion,
then it is not proper, but borrowed; But as I beleeve that <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
spake not by a Metaphor to God, when he said, <HI>Gen. 18. 25.
Shall not the Judge of all the world do right?</HI> God absolving and
and condemning the sons of men, giving rewards, and inflict∣ing
penalties, is a Judge properly so called; so I do not think
that God spake in any Metaphor to <HI>Abraham,</HI> when in the
chapter before, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. he saith, <HI>I will establish my covenant
between me and thee, and thy seed after thee.</HI> God is a Judge of
all the earth, properly so called, and he hath entred a covenant
with his people, properly so called likewise. It is true, that we un∣derstand,
<PB N="44" REF="40"/>
that relation of God to his people, more clearly by
the Analogy that it bears to Judges, that are set up among men, for
absolution of the innocent, &amp; condemning of the guilty, And so we
are holpen in our understandings of the covenant of God entred
with his people, by Analogy with the covenants, that are among
men; but, in neither of both of these, is the word taken out of its
proper sense, and applyed to any other, that it will not properly
bear. I finde indeed an eminent Divine affirming, <HI>That a covenant
is not so properly said, to be with God and man, as between man and
man,</HI> not denying the duty, which man owes to God, nor the en∣gagement
by which he is obliged, but freely yeelding both; and
sticking only at the consent on mans part, <HI>which among men</HI> (he sayes) <HI>is requisite, and doth mutually concur to make the covenant va∣lid.
But neither in the covenant of nature, or grace, is this consent an∣teceding
the validity of the covenant required in man.</HI> This I confesse
I am not able to reach. Nothing with me is more plain, then that,
consent is pre-required in both these covenants: <HI>Adam,</HI> I confesse,
(as it is objected) was bound to consent, yea, I will yeeld more, that
it is no more possible to conceive <HI>Adam</HI> to deny consent, then the
Sunne to be without light; seeing in his natural motion he was
carried in that way of full conformity to God, that the Sun may as
well be dark, as <HI>Adam</HI> averse from the will or tender of God; yet
if we could conceive a dark Sunne; it could not be a light to rule
the day; so if we could conceive <HI>Adam</HI> denying consent to God,
in the tender of covenant, <HI>Adam</HI> had not been in covenant. For
fallen man it is clear; what held the Pharisees out of the New
covenant, but their non-consent? rejecting the counsel of God a∣gainst
themselves, <HI>Luk</HI> 7. 30. as also those Jews, <HI>Act.</HI> 13. who contra∣dicting
and blaspheming, <HI>judged themselves unworthy of eternal life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The covenant was tendered to all those Gentile Nations, and
Cities where the Gospel was preached, and all were bound to
yeeld assent, but where there was assent of faith, there the cove∣nant
was entered; where assent is denied, there they remained,
strangers from the covenants of promise; in the same way of
Gentilisme, as though the Gospel had never been tendered, or the
Name of Christ held forth. So that these things considered, I doubt
not but I have made it appear,</HI> That there is a mutual contract, and
mutual performances to which persons are engaged, not only usually
in covenants, but in all covenants. <HI>And that</HI> it is of the general na∣ture
<PB N="45" REF="40"/>
of covenants, that there should be such a convertibility, as that
both must, if not seal, (some <HI>contracts are without seals</HI>) yet contract,
or performe, and where a seal is vouchsafed, must accept of it: <HI>and
that the definition of the covenant in the general is vindicated,</HI>
That God hath entred a covenant properly so called, with man, with
fallen man, in which there is a contract of this nature, and engage∣ments
to mutual performances, God condescending to it of grace, and
man obliged to it by duty, yet accepting voluntarily. <HI>Which (as
the former) might be confirmed by the authority of Divines of e∣minency.
Mr.</HI> Ball <HI>speaking of the covenant of God in the gene∣ral
entred with man, saith, It may be thus described.</HI> A mutual
compact or agreement betwixt God and man, whereby God promiseth
all good things, specially eternal happinesse unto man, upon just, equal,
and favourable conditions: and man doth promise to walk before
God in all acceptable, free, and willing obedience, expecting all good
from God, and happinesse in God, according to his promise, for the praise
and glory of his great Name. <HI>And</HI> Vrsin <HI>in his Catechisme, page
91. defining a covenant in the general nature of it as before, he
saith, it is</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Foedus Dei est mutua pactio inter Deum &amp; homines, quâ Deus confirmat hominibus se futurum eis propitium, re∣missurum pec∣cata, donaturum justitiam no∣vam, Spiritum Sanctum, &amp; vitam aeternam per &amp; propter Filium Media∣torem; vicissim homines se obligant Deo ad fidem &amp; poenetentiam, hoc est, ad recepiendum verâ fide hoc tantum be∣neficium, &amp; ad praestandam Deo veram obedientiam.</NOTE> A mutual agreement between God and man, whereby God

them a new righteousnesse, his holy Spirit and everlasting life, in and

mercy alone, and to yeeld true obedience to God. <HI>And</HI> Lucas Trelca∣tius

a mutual obligation of God and man, by a stipulation inter∣vening,
that what is promised on both parts, may be performed.
<HI>And farther saith,</HI> There are two parties of the covenant. 1. The
promise of God concerning everlasting life. 2. The obligation of man
<PB N="46" REF="41"/>
<HI>for performance of the condition prescribed of God; the first is free,
the second is necessary.</HI> And in conclusion, such a bottome I be∣lieve
is laid in the Introduction, that will bear the whole fabrick
that follows after. <HI>Junius</HI> and <HI>Gomarus,</HI> are as opposite as may be,
one to the other in this dispute about the covenant, as may be
seen in the Appendix to the first chapter: But they both agree in
this, that every covenant of necessity is to have mutual engage∣ments
and performances. <HI>Gomarus</HI> denies that the promise, <HI>Gen.</HI>
3. 15. containes the covenant of grace, because no conditions are
there mentioned. And <HI>Junius</HI> to avoid conditions, denies that there
is any such thing as a covenant between God and man, for if it
were a covenant, he sayes it must have conditions. Therefore ac∣cording
to them both, if we grant a covenant, we must grant con∣ditions,
and the full nature of the covenant, is in no Scripture laid
down, where we have not these engagements, or conditions, laid
down likewise. Some think to reconcile all this by the various ac∣ception
of the word. <HI>Sometimes it is soused in Scripture, that the
free promise of God is thereby signified, and the restipulation of our du∣ty
withit, God requiring man to engage by covenant to that which
he might require, did there no promise intervene; yet sometimes in
Scripture, covenant doth signifie the absolute promise of God, with∣out
any restipulation, and of this kinde is that covenant in which
God promiseth to give to his elect faith and perseverance, to which
promise there cannot be conceived any condition to be annexed, which
is not comprehended in the promise it self.</HI> So Learned <HI>Camero de
triplici foedere,</HI> Thes. 1. 2. For this absolute covenant here spoke
to, I desire the Reader to observe what the same learned Au∣thour
hath farther in his third Thesis. <HI>This distinction of the
Covenant, doth depend upon the distinction of the love of God;
for there is a love of God to the Creature, from whence every thing
that is good in the creature hath wholly flowed; and there is the
acquiescent love of God in the creature, and this the creature hath re∣ceived,
not for any thing from it self, but from God, as it was loved
with that first love of God: that love, for better understanding, we call
Gods primary or antecedent; this Gods secondary or consequent love:
from that we say, doth depend both the paction, and fulfilling of the
absolute covenant, from this depends the fulfilling of that covenant;
to which is annexed a restipulation, not so the paction, for that we
say depends on the first love.</HI> This antecedent love is wont to be
<PB N="47" REF="41"/>
called <HI>Amor benevolentiae,</HI> which can be no more then a purpose or
resolution in God for good to man. The second is wont to be cal∣led
<HI>Amor complacentiae,</HI> a love of delight, or content. How the for∣mer
can be a covenant, or any covenant properly so called depend
upon it, as preceding the latter, I do not see.</P>
<P>First, this goes before the giving of Christ; the gift of Christ is
an effect of it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 16. Now God covenants not with man, with∣out
the Mediator as <HI>Camero</HI> himself acknowledges; and therefore
this that precedes, can be no covenant made.</P>
<P>Secondly, a covenant plainly argues an agreement, at least in
tender from one, and professed acceptation from the other party.
A covenant of parties at a distance, either party holding his di∣stance,
respective to that where the distance is held, is the greatest
absurdity. Now in this absolute covenant (as it is called) there
is not so much as a tender from God, much lesse an acceptance
from man, and so, as yet a distance held, and therefore no cove∣nant
or agreement.</P>
<P>Thirdly, this supposed absolute covenant, <HI>Jer. 31, 33. Heb.</HI> 8. 10.
hath mercies of two sorts; graces, priviledges; And though men
contend that the promise of grace is absolute, seeing there is no∣thing
pre-required of us, for the writing of this Law in our hearts,
yet the priviledge of remission of sins hath its conditions, <HI>Act. 10.
43. Act. 13. 38, 39. Act.</HI> 3. 19.</P>
<P>Fourthly, none can claim any interest in, or take any comfort
from, this absolute covenant, depending on the antecedent love of
God, preceding the conditional covenant, depending on the con∣sequent
love of God: before he hath entered the second which is
conditional, and performed the conditions, and knows that he hath
performed them. This is clear, it is made, all say, with the Elect;
now none can claime his interest till he knows his Election, which
is made sure only, by our saith, and new obedience, by the know∣ledge
that we have of our faith and new obedience. But it is enough
to me that a covenant comprizing a restipulation of our duty, is
here confest, which is the Gospel way to salvation, without which,
the acquiescent love of God is not attained. As to that Text, <HI>Heb.</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Further Objections against the former doctrine
Answered.</HEAD>
<P>THe covenant of grace entred with fallen man (<HI>saith one</HI>) is
called an everlasting covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Further ob∣ctions against the conditio∣nality of the Covenant answered.</NOTE> and <HI>Heb. 8. 12. God saith,</HI>
I will be merciful to your iniquities, and your sinnes will I remem∣ber
no more. Now suppose there were conditions for man to performe,
and man did faile in those conditions, what were become of the
covenant?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The conditions failing of the covenant is broke, the everlast∣ing
covenant is broke, which though it seeme a contradiction to
some, yet it is not so to the Prophet, <HI>Is. 24. 5. They have transgressed
the Law, changed the Ordinances, and broken the everlasting Cove∣nant.</HI>
It is said to be everlasting, because it shall not be antiqua∣ted
for another to succeed it, or at least that man is not to put a
period to it, so Circumcision and the Passeover are Ordinances
for ever, not that non-entring into it never break or transgresse
it; The Elect of God Regenerate, do indeed keep covenant; so do
not all that enter into it. There are frequent Scripture-complaints
of Breach of covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is said, Man hath no tie upon him, to perform any
thing whatsoever with covenant, as, a condition that must be obser∣ved
on his part, let the covenant it self be judge in this case; mark it
in <HI>Jeremy, Ezekiel,</HI> or in <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In those Texts there are graces mentioned; as Gods
work on the soule, and priviledges promised to be enjoyed.
Whatsoever is there set forth, as Gods work upon the soul, is
also required of man as duty, namely to <HI>be renued in the spirit
of his mind,</HI> Eph. 4. 23. <HI>To make him a new heart, and a new spirit,</HI>
Ezek. 18. 31. <HI>That the Word of Christ dwell in him richly in all
wisdome,</HI> Col. 3. 16. It will be hard for any to point out a pro∣mise
of this nature, but it may be answered with a command,
as an obligation unto duty; As the precepts must not thrust
out the promise, nor duty shoulder out free grace, So,
<PB N="49" REF="42"/>
the promise must not destroy the precept; In that of <HI>Jeremy,</HI>
conditions on mans part are included, so as by the assistance of
grace to be performed. The tie lies upon us, on pain of losse
of all that the covenant promiseth, and bearing all that-it threat∣neth.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Suppose (<HI>saith one</HI>) there should be a fault, of performing
in this Covenant, whose were the fault?</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>The fault is his; who is chidden in Scripture, and beaten
for it, namely those</HI> that did flatter God with their mouth, and lied
unto him with their tongues, whose heart was not right with him,
nor were sledfast in his covenant, <HI>Ps. 78. 36, 37. They,</HI> upon whom he
will bring a sword to avenge the quarrel of his covenant, <HI>Lev. 26. 25.
are in the fault.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> if there be conditions, then the covenant is not free, gifts
must be of absolute grace and bounty, if a condition be required, the
freedome of the gift is destroyed.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is true of such conditions, where there is merit in
the condition, whereby benefit accrues to him, that engages by
promise, holding proportion with the reward; But, here is nothing
indented by way of covenant, but that homage which is natural∣ly
due, which God may challenge from us as creatures; without
either engagement unto, or exhibition of any reward at all for
their paines, and what he may require without reward, when he
covenants for it, the reward is free. If <HI>Abraham</HI> had made <HI>Eliezer</HI>
of <HI>Damascus</HI> his heir, upon his faithful service, the inheritance
had yet been a free gift, and of grace conferr'd upon him. Make the
Proposition universal, All conditions in promises destroy the na∣ture
of a gift in the thing promised, and then it is to be denied, A
covenant of grace would then be a contradiction, seeing it is no
covenant, (as hath been demonstrated) without a condition. Then
the Prophet doth contradict himself in the tender of a covenant,
in the most free manner as is possible, <HI>Isa. 55. 1, 2. Ho, every one
that thirsteth, &amp;c.</HI> even their conditions are required; <HI>Incline
your ear, and come unto me, Hear and your soul shall live; Let the
wicked for sake his way, the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him
return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and unto
our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</HI> Here are free promises
with conditions; Men, who have not that sovereignty, account their
gifts free, and yet require conditions from them on whom they
<PB N="50" REF="43"/>
are conferred. An Alms-house is founded, and endowed with re∣venue,
conditions are put upon the Almes-people, to reside in
such an house assigned, to wear clothes of the colour and forme
prescribed, or whatsoever else the Founder please, and yet the
gift is free. Finally, God cannot covenant with man, and keep
up his sovereignty, if we leave out obedience in the Articles of
the covenant. The covenant is upon equal termes, if subjection be
excluded; to be a God in covenant, and not require subjection,
is the highest of contradictions.</P>
<P>A Learned Writer, after a large discourse held of the right
that Redeemed ones have to the death of Christ before beleeving,
saith, <HI>Here may be observed the mistake of those, who winde up the
merit of Christ, as affecting God (as I may so speak;) unto a conditi∣onal
engagement,</HI> viz. <HI>that we shall be made partakers of the fruits
of it, upon such and such conditions to be by us fulfilled▪</HI> It will be
worth our labour to enquire what is meant by the conditional
engagement, unto which he says some winde up the merit of
Christ, as affecting God with it; doth he mean such conditions,
that as causes or impulsive motives take with God to enter such
engagement? If this be the meaning, I shall freely yeeld that
there is no such conditional covenant, that there is no
such condition in any Covenant of God with man. In this
sense Master <HI>Culverwell</HI> in his Treatise of Faith, <HI>page</HI> 143. takes
it, Having mentioned several conditional promises, (in which
faith is expressely required, and such wherein it is necessarily
understood) he saith, <HI>In all which, faith is necessarily understood,
for the obtaining of the benefit promised. But yet in all these, faith,
is no condition properly so called, moving God to promise life.</HI> But ta∣king
it, in this restrained sense, as moving God to promise life,
he much mistakes himself, where he saith, <HI>That it confounds
the Law and the Gospel, taking away a chief difference between the
covenant of works and the covenant of grace, page</HI> 141. Seeing
there was no condition, thus understood in the covenant of works;
There was not any such good, accruing to God by any thing
that <HI>Adam</HI> was to do, that upon it, or for it, God should make
the promise of life. God hath no motives out of himself, to
confer his rewards, Conditions taken in such a sense; will make
the covenant of grace, and the covenant of works all unconditi∣onal.
But taking the word [condition] in the sense, as, it is in
<PB N="51" REF="43"/>
ordinary use, and as it properly signifies, for duty in covenant in∣dented,
agreed upon, and assented to, on performance, or neglect
of which, the promise stands or falls, it is plain that there are such
conditions in both covenants, equally, in one as the other. The
necessity of the concurrence of grace to the work of faith, will
as soon make it no duty as no condition, and many denying the
one, have learnt to deny either of both, as well duties, as condi∣tions.
Mr. <HI>Culverwel</HI> therefore consesseth, that, faith in some
sort may be called a condition, because the promise of life is made
to persons qualified with faith, <HI>page</HI> 143. and this conditional pro∣mise
well understood (saith he) <HI>page</HI> 141. may be born. And if
understood, with such a restraint as the word will not suffer (we
confesse) Christians must not acknowledge it. This being premised,
let us look into the reasons brought to back the former asser∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> All such conditions, if spiritual blessings, are part of the pur∣chase
of the death of Christ, and if not, are no way fit to be conditions
of such an attainment.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They are so parts of his purchase, that they are also our
act, The act of man by the power of God; God gives faith and
gives repentance, yet we beleeve and we repent, we may as easily
reconcile Christs purchase, with the nature of a condition, as
Gods free gift of grace with our duty, If the gift were of grace
and no duty required, then there were force in the argu∣ment.
This ridgidly followed, will disingage man from all obe∣dience
to God, seeing all power to obey, is part of the purchase
of Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It cannot be made apparent, how any such conditional sti∣pulation
can be ascribed to God.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We finde such a one in Scripture ascribed to God, no
condition can in more plain terms be held our. In case we cannot
see how it can be, it were safer to lay our hands on our mouths; and
acknowledge our weaknesse, then to withstand so clear evidence.
He is pleased to give his Reasons.</P>
<P><HI>First, saith he,</HI> It leaves no proper place for he merit of Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This reason I can by no means reach. Christ may merit,
and upon what terms he pleases, confer what he hath merited; Du∣ty
in us excludes merit in Christ, as well as conditions imposed
upon u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. See <HI>Ball</HI> on the covenant, <HI>page</HI> 133.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="44"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> It is very improperly ascribed to God, &amp;c. Stipulation,
or engagements upon conditions, that are properly so, do suppose him
that makes the engagement, to be altogether uncertain of the event
thereof, for which the authority of Lawyers is quoted.</P>
<P>If conditions among men be of such uncertainty, it doth not
thence follow, that it is so in those conditions which God impo∣ses,
on performance of which he conferres the mercies which he
gives in promise. If there be so much difference between moral
hope, and that Christian grace which is wrought by the Spirit, that
the one is only possible, conjectural, uncertain and doubtful, the
other assured and never failing; The one often ending in shame,
The other never making ashamed; Then there may be a like dif∣ference
in the conditions assigned by man, and those assigned by
God, Men may be still uncertain, yet God may be assured, the e∣vent
being not left to contingency or the freedome of mans will,
(which is supposed to stand in <HI>aequilibrio,</HI>) but determined by the
act of grace which is not hid from him, whose hand works it in
the hearts of his people. This might seem to carry far rather force
against all conditions in the first covenant, which is yet granted
to be conditional, which for performance was meerly suspended
on mans will, but hath no colour against the conditions of the
second covenant, which God works of grace as he requires of so∣vereignty.</P>
<P>One is pleased to say, <HI>Surely they are wide (if not very wilde) who
affirm that all the stipulations on the part of God, upon the death of
Christ are upon a condition, which himself knows to be impossible for
them to perform, to whom they are made,</HI> which among Wise men are
always accounted nugatory and null. And may not the like be
said of exhortations, promises, threats, commands? God as well
knows our disability to answer these, as to fulfil conditions, yet
they are neither wide, nor wilde, that acknowledge such exhorta∣tions,
promises, threats, commands, without abilities in fallen man
to answer them, farther then the concurrence of grace that is in
Christ Jesus strengthens them; There are many more Objections
raised by others which the Reader may see brought in, by Mr.
<HI>Grayl</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and fully answered.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">God in the dayes of the Gospel keeps up the power and au∣thority
of his Law, The obligation of it is still in force
to binde the consciences of beleevers.</HEAD>
<P>THe last Position that I shall premise, is, <HI>That God in his entry
of covenant with man in sinne, doth so manifest his free grace,
that he still keeps up his Sovereignty; so exalts mercy, that he
loseth nothing of his rule and authority;</HI> His chief aime is to ex∣alt
the glory of his free grace, and to set out the riches of his great
mercy, that so noble a <HI>species,</HI> as that of mankinde might not for
ever perish, yet he quits not man of his subjection and obedi∣ence.
When the Angels fell, some stood, (whether the fallen or
persevering number be greater, cannot be determined) but when
man fell, mankinde wholly was lost, and unlesse grace save, must
everlastingly perish. As some, with the lost Angels must be ob∣jects
on whom God will glorifie his justice, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 41. So o∣thers,
must be vessels of mercy, on whom his free grace shall be
seen, to make them as the Angels of heaven. Therefore love is
assigned as the alone impulsory motive; <HI>God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten sonne,</HI> John 3. 16. <HI>God who is rich in
mercy, according to the great love, wherewith he loved us, when we
were dead in sinne,</HI> Eph. 2. 5. Of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mans fall by sin was no dis∣obligation to obedience.</NOTE> all that expect to be saved by
grace, must be tender, that it be not obscured; Gods designe be∣ing
to advance it, our care must be that it be not lessened. In this
exercise of free grace, God yet keeps up authority and rule, power
and dominion still is his. Man was made of God subject to a Law
and under dominion, having the law written in his heart from the
Creation, and he was not divested of it by <HI>Adams</HI> fall, nor yet de∣livered
from it by Christs Redemption. <HI>Corvinus</HI> indeed in his
Reply to <HI>Moulin</HI> (cap. 8. sect. 7.) saith,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Cùm itaque homo jaceret sub maledicti∣one, ad obedien∣tiam amplius non obligabatur quia coli ab eo Deus ampliù<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> non volebat.</NOTE> <HI>That men under an obli∣gation

will not be served by that man that hath violated his Covenant,</HI>
giving his reason of this assertion, <HI>To</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Nam quòd coli à creature sua De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> vult fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is est.</NOTE> <HI>be admitted to serve is a

guilt and wrath. But this is a manifest errour, Mans guilt can
never rob God of his Sovereignty, nor yet disingage man from his
duty, Standing right with God, he is bound to homage; Under
guilt, he is bound both to homage and punishment; and to be
admitted to serve is not meerly of favour, but of dominion and
power. It was no great favour, that <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> found, in the
service of <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> to serve with acceptance is indeed a favour;
but necessity, and duty ties all that are under Sovereignty. As man
fallen, in right is a subject, though in his demeanour a rebel; So
in his regenerate estate still he ows subjection. When God became
a Saviour to the Elect of mankind, he did not cease to be a So∣vereigne.
<HI>The children of a King and Emperour know their fa∣ther
to be their Sovereign,</HI> as by one is well observed. The child of
God knows God in Christ to be his Lord; We are redeemed not
to licentiousnesse, not to a state of manumission from the com∣mand
of God, but <HI>to serve in righteousnesse and true holinesse all
the dayes of our life,</HI> Luke 1. 74. It can be no part of our Christian
freedome to be from under the Sovereignty of heaven.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sovereign∣ty of God is held up.</NOTE> This So∣vereignty
of God is two wayes held forth unto us. First, in keep∣ing
up his commandments, the power and vigour of his precepts.
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. In keeping up his com∣mandments.</NOTE> in his exercise of discipline in chastisement, and corre∣ction.
Here I shall assert three things; First, <HI>God in the days of
the Gospel, keeps up the power and authority of his Law; the Obliga∣tion
of it is still in force to binde the consciences of beleevers.</HI> Se∣condly,
<HI>That this Law which God thus keeps up in force, is a per∣fect
and compleat rule to those to whom it is given.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>That
this Law binds, as given by the hand of Moses.</HI> As to the first, when
I speak thus, of the Obligation of the Law, I hope I scarce need
to tell in what sense; I do take the Law, Not in the largest
sense, for any doctrine, instruction, or Ordinance of any kinde
whatsoever, Men have their Laws and Directories: but I have
to deal with the Law of God: Neither do I take it for the whole
of the Word of God, all his will revealed in his Word, as it is taken,
<HI>Isa. 2. 3. The Law shall go forth of</HI> Zion, <HI>and the Word of the Lord
from Jerusalem.</HI> Nor yet as it is taken for all the Scripture of the
Old Testament, as in that Text of the Apostle, <HI>In the Law it
is written by men of other tongues, and by other languages I will
speak to this people,</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 21. Nor yet for the five books of
<HI>Moses,</HI> as it is taken in the words of Christ, <HI>All must be fulfilled
<PB N="55" REF="45"/>
that was written in the Law of</HI> Moses, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 44. Neither do
I here understand the Ceremonial Law, which stood up as
a partition between Jew and Gentile, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 14. All that did
binde the Jews, and was not of force from God with the Gentiles,
is taken off from Christians; There was a confession of guilt; a
beast needed not to have been slain, if they had been innocent;
this held them under hopes that there was sacrifice to take away
sinne, imposed on the Jewes till the time of reformation, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.
10. as an Appendix to the first Table; fitted to the Jewes state
and condition, as a shadow of good things to come, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 1.
Nor yet the judicial Law, given to order the Common-wealth or
State of that people, farther then so much of it, as was of nature,
and then did bind the Gentiles. It is the Moral-Law that I meane,
that Law which was obligatory, not only to the Jews, but Gen∣tiles,
for breach of which they suffered, <HI>Levit.</HI> 18. 27, 28. Neither
do I understand the Moral Law, as a covenant, upon observation
of which life was expected and might be claimed. This is utterly
inconsistent with the Gospel. <HI>If there had been a Law that could
have given life, verily righteousnesse had been by the Law,</HI> Gal. 3. 21.
And this righteousnesse giving life, utterly overthrows the Gospel.
<HI>If righteousnesse come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</HI> Gal.
2. 21. In which sense I deny that the Jewes were ever under the
Law. The Law was not given as such a covenant as shall God
willing be shewn. So the Moral Law and Ceremonial Law should
militate one against another. The Moral Law holding them in
themselves, looking for a righteousnesse of works, and the Cere∣monial
Law leading them out of themselves, unto a sacrifice for
remission of sinne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law hath a commanding power over beleeevers.</NOTE> <HI>Abraham</HI> was under no such covenant, he
had the Gospel preached to him, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 8. and so had the seed of
<HI>Abraham.</HI> But it still hath the nature of a Law binding to obe∣dience,
it is for ever a rule, for the guide of our wayes. That
it was once of force, is without question; and above all contra∣diction,
and therefore I need not to multiply Old Testament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Scriptures for it; There is no repeale of it, it was never anti∣quated
and abolished; therefore it is of force; Though a Law be
urged, yet if a repeal may be pleaded, there is a discharge. That
it is not repealed, I shall shew, and further that it is not capable
of any repeal. If it be repealed, then either by Christ, at his
coming in the flesh; or else by his Apostles, by commission
<PB N="56" REF="46"/>
from him, after the Spirit was given; But neither Christ in per∣son,
nor the Apostles by any commission from him did repeal it;
but instead of a repeale, did put a new sanction upon it; Christ
indeed as soon as he publickly appeared in the work of redempti∣on,
was charged that he came to destroy the Law; But this
he did utterly disavow, and men of faith in Christ should believe
him, professing that he came not <HI>to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it.</HI>
Yea, that there is a greater stability in the Law in every tittle of it
in regard of the permanency, then is in heaven and earth, then is in
the whole frabrick of the world; And whereas the Scribes and
Pharisees were then thought to be the only strict observers of
the rule of the Law, and the alone men that kept up the honour
of it, Christ asserts a necessity of a higher degree of obedience
then the Scribes and Pharisees ever taught or practised, <HI>Except
your righteousnesse exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pha∣risees,
&amp;c.</HI> which must be understood of righteousnesse inhe∣rent,
in conformity to the Law, as appeares in the precedent
words, where Christ holds discourse about the Law, and is more
fully confirmed in the words that follow; Christ on this occasi∣on
openeth the commandments of the Law, shewing how farre
Scribes and Pharisees went in their righteousnesse, how farre we
must transcend them if ever we come to the Kingdome of heaven.
Neither did the Apostles by any Commission from Christ repeal
it, but they add the same sanction to it. <HI>Paul</HI> foreseeing that
this very thing would be charged upon him, as it was upon Christ,
saith, <HI>Do we make void the Law through faith? yea, we establish</HI>
(saith he) <HI>the Law,</HI> Rom 3. 31. Our doctrine is a confirmation,
and no abolition of it. And both he, and other Apostles
frequently in their Epistles, urge precepts of the Moral Law, as
in force, and having power and command over men in covenant.
<HI>Paul</HI> laying a charge upon children to obey their parents, <HI>Ephes.</HI>
6. 1. urges it from the fifth Commandment; which he there sets out
with a mark of honour, <HI>as the first Commandment with promise,</HI>
and paraphraseth upon the promise, annexed to it, against
which children might enter their challenge, if in Gospel-times
the Law had lost its commanding power. And requiring obedi∣ence
from wives to husbands, the Law is quoted for it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.
34. Having proved the equity of Ministers maintenance by an
argument drawn from civil right, and common rules of equity in
<PB N="57" REF="46"/>
three particulars, he adds, <HI>Say I these things, or saith not the Law,
also the same?</HI> And so quotes a Text of the Law, the Law as
delivered by <HI>Moses, for it is written in the Law of</HI> Moses, <HI>Thou
shalt not muzzle the Oxe that treadeth out the corn,</HI> 1 Cor. 9. 9. and
then cleareth it from an exception that might be taken against it.
So <HI>James 2. 8. If ye fulfil the royal Law, Thou shalt love thy neigh∣bour
as thy self, ye do well.</HI> The Law is of force in that grand du∣ty,
so in other precepts there mentioned, <HI>Do not commit adultery,
Do not kill,</HI> verse 11. yea, it is of force in the least duties, <HI>ver. 10.
He that shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty
of all,</HI> 1 Thes. 47, 8. We have the seventh and eighth Command∣ment
quoted as of force with Christians. As also, <HI>Rom. 12. 19.

written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord,</HI> quoting the
Law, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 35.</P>
<P>Neither is it capable of any repeal, being the Law of nature
written in the hearts of heathens, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 15. more clearly there∣fore
in the heart of <HI>Adam.</HI> These are of those things that are
<HI>prohibita, quia mala;</HI> The transgression of them was forbidden,
because evil of their own nature, The Creation standing, the
Law could be no other: If no Law had ever been promulged, or
given of God to man, yet murder and adultery had been sinne,
Christ not changing the Law of Creation, but taking to himself the
nature of man, (the same as it was first created) when he came to
save man, must of necessity keep on foot that law that was from
the beginning stampt upon him; So that we see it is not abolished,
but ratified, neither is it in a capacity of abolition. It is confest
by a great party, of those, that in this appeare as adversaries,
that there is no liberty to sinne in the dayes of the Gospel. There
be not many that will avouch the contrary, if they do, they must
know that they have the Gospel against them, <HI>that hath in a readi∣nesse
to avenge all disobedience,</HI> 2 Cor. 6. 10. The Apostle writes
to beleevers, <HI>that they sinne not,</HI> 1 John 2. 1. And this is the de∣finition
of sinne, 1 <HI>John 3. 4. Sinne is a transgression of the Law.</HI>
As for those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beleevers have no sinne, cannot sinne, it
is to little purpose to speak to them, or having any thing to
deale with them. If they believe not <HI>John,</HI> they will not beleeve
me telling them that <HI>that there is no truth in them,</HI> 1 John 1. 8.
He that pleaseth may see a large confirmation of this truth in
<PB N="58" REF="47"/>
Mr. <HI>Burg, Vindiciae Legis,</HI> and Master <HI>Boltons</HI> Treatise of the true
bounds of Christian freedome, <HI>page</HI> 77. to 88. Therefore one
much forgets himselfe, who in a Treatise of the two covenants,
bespeaks his Reader in these words: <HI>Consider this seriously, that
if you be beleevers, and married to Christ, the Law hath no more
power over you then a dead husband hath over his relict and living
wife,</HI> which he presently interprets of a commanding power,
and denies, <HI>that the Law hath any commanding power over a be∣leever.</HI>
Which assertion of his, that it may be the more observed,
he puts into his Index: <HI>The Law hath no commanding power over
a beleever.</HI></P>
<P>The same Authour yet says, <HI>that the Law is a discoverer of,
and convincer of sinne to beleevers, It is a curb to the pride and pre∣sumption
of beleevers as well as of unbeleevers;</HI> But if a husband
cannot by reason of death command his wife, how can be con∣vince
her of her faults, or be a curb or restraint to her? <HI>Job</HI>
was in right of command over his wife, as long as he had power
of reproof, to tell her of her folly, and to endavour to put a stop
to it. In his answer of an objection he yeelds, that <HI>though the
Law should be dead to a beleever, and a beleever dead to the Law,
yet it doth not thence follow that they should sinne, must sinne, or will
sinne;</HI> Upon this supposition I say, there is not in them a capa∣city
of sinne, or possibility of sinning. He further sayes, <HI>There
would be no sinne (were it not for a Law) for the Law gives (if I
may so terme it) a being to sinne, and therefore is called the strength
of sinne, for if a man should swear, covet, or kill, and there should
be no Law prohibiting the same, doubtlesse it would not be evil, for
the Law makes it evil.</HI> And if the Law hath lost its commanding
power, then it can give sinne no more being, yea, it hath lost
its own being, power of command being of the essence of it.
If the Law, <HI>Thou shalt not kill,</HI> have no power of command, then,
I sin not, if I kill. If that Law, <HI>Sweare not at all,</HI> have no power
of commanding, then, our RANTERS high oaths, are no more
sinnes, then our eating of swines flesh, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not observing the
Feast of the Passeover, <HI>Where there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there is no trans∣gression:</HI>
and a Law antiquated and repealed, that the power of
command is gone (as in the Laws before mentioned) is no Law.
If he still pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse that similitude of the Apostle, that a dead hus∣band
hath now power of command, But the Law to a beleever
<PB N="59" REF="47"/>
is a dead husband. First, I say, if he will be pleased to informe
me, how a dead husband rips up his wives faults, how he curbs
and keeps her in, (which he confesses is the Laws office to a
beleever) then I shall speedily give an account, how this dead
husband retaines power of command. The Argument is as well
of force, The dead husband hath no power to discover his wives
faults, to restraine, curb, or keep her in: But the Law is a
dead husband to beleevers; Therefore the Law hath no such
power. It lies upon him to answer this argument to free him∣self
from self-contradiction. And I would faine see this an∣swered,
and the other maintained. Secondly, for more full sa∣tisfaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7. 1, &amp;c. vindicated.</NOTE>
I say that some learned Expositors make the hus∣band
in that similitude not to be the Law, but sinne, which hath
its power from the Law. So <HI>Diodati</HI> in his Notes upon the place.
<HI>Man signifieth sinne, which hath power from the Law, the woman is
our humane nature, and of these two, are begotten the depraved errours
of sinne;</HI> So also Doctor <HI>Reynolds</HI> in his Treatise of Divorce, <HI>page</HI>
37. setting out the scope of this similitude, thus expresseth it, <HI>As
a wife her husband being dead, doth lawfully take another, and is not
an adulteresse; in having his company, to bring forth fruit of her
body to him; so regenerate persons, their natural corruption (provoked
by the Law to sin) and flesh being mortified, and joyned to Christ as
to a second husband.</HI> Master <HI>Burges Vindiciae Degis,</HI> page
218. saith, <HI>Sinne which by the Law doth irritate and provoke our
corruption, that is the former husband the soul had, and lusts they
are the children thereof,</HI> and this the rather is to be received,
because the Apostle in his reddition doth not say <HI>the Law is dead,
but we are dead.</HI> But if he will still contend that the Law is the
husband in that place; which by reason of corruption hath so
much power for irritation and condemnation over an unregene∣rate
man; I shall onely give him that advice which Doctor <HI>Rey∣nolds</HI>
in the place quoted, gives <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> upon occasion of his in∣terpretation
of this similitude. <HI>Let</HI> Bellarmine <HI>acknowledge that
similitudes must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be set on the rack, nor the drift thereof be
streched in such sort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they ought, just in length, breadth, and
depth, to match and sit that whereunto they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>mbled</HI> And when
he confesseth power in the Law notwithstanding this death to
performe diverse offices in the souls of beleever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot af∣firme
that the law is wholly dead, nor deny but that it may have
<PB N="60" REF="48"/>
this office of command likewise. The power which the Law lo∣seth,
is that which corruption gave it, which is irritation and
condemnation; Corruption never gave command to the Law, and
the death of corruption, through the Spirit, can never exempt the
soul from obedience, or take the power of command from it. Let
it be granted that the Law is the husband here mentioned, the si∣militude
is this. That as the Law through our corruption was
fruitful in mans nature to the bringing forth of sinne and condem∣nation,
So Christ by the Spirit is to be fruitful in our nature to
bring forth works of grace to salvation, and so the death of the
Law is meerly in respect of irritation, or inflaming to sinne; and
binding over to condemnation, not in respect of command. That
this is the full and clear scope of this similitude, beyond which it
must not be stretched, plainly appeares, <HI>verse 5. For when we
were in the flesh, the motions of sinnes which were by the Law, did
work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</HI> So that here
is nothing against the commanding power of the Law: God still
keeps up his Sovereignty, and by this Law he rules the regene∣rate.
I wish our Authour would sadly reflect upon that rea∣son
of his, <HI>The Law is not authorized by Christ to reigne and
rule in the consciences of his people, For his Fathers peace, his own
righteousnesse, and his Spirits joy.</HI> There is none that speaks of
the reigne of the Law in the consciences of the people of God,
but God in Christ reigns, and by his Moral Law rules, for all these
reasons, So farre are these from excluding his rule, by his Law in
his peoples hearts. If this rule of the Law be destructive
to Christs righteousnesse, then Christs coming for righteous∣nesse
must needs be to destroy the Law, which Christ dis∣claimes.
And the rule of the peace of God in our hearts, is
so farre from excluding his rule by his Law, that without it,
it can never be attained, <HI>Great peace have they that love thy
Law, and nothing shall offend them,</HI> Psalme 119. 165. <HI>This is the
confidence that we have in God, that whatsoever we ask according to
his will, we shall receive, because we keep his commandments,</HI> 1 John
3. 22. A Commandment hath a command<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> power, and only
they that keep them have this peace ruling in their hearts. The
Spirits joy, and the power of the Law to command, are so farre
from opposing one the other, that the Spirit gives testimony of
Gods abode in no other but such as confesse and yeeld to this
<PB N="61" REF="48"/>
power. <HI>He that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him, and he
in him: and hereby we know that be abideth in us, by the Spirit which
he hath given us,</HI> 1 John 3. 24. And of like nature is that which
he further hath, <HI>Though the Law (the former husband) be dead to
a beleever, yet a beleever is no widow, much lesse an harlot; for he is
married to Christ, and is under the Law of Christ, which is love.</HI>
If the moral Law respective to the power of command be dead,
then love is dead with it. <HI>Jesus Christ reduces the ten Command∣ments
into two: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</HI> If then the
Law be dead, this love from the heart is dead, and so a belee∣ver
is either a widow or an harlot. Master <HI>Burges, Vindiciae
Legis,</HI> page 12. shews at large that <HI>to do a thing out of obedience
to the Law, and yet by love and delight, do not oppose one another,</HI>
which if the Reader consult with his enlargement of it, he shall
need to go no farther for refutation, nor his own satisfaction.
Men are wont to expect in children and servants (much more in
wives) both love and obedience: If this rule hold, they
must quit the one, and cleave to the other; Either they must take to
love, without obedience, or obedience without love. These
two which cannot be severed (if ye love and keep my Command∣ments)
this Divinity makes inconsistent. <HI>God gave Laws</HI> (saith
our Authour) <HI>to man to declare his own Sovereignty, and his crea∣tures
duty.</HI> And we must tell him, that to keep up his Sovereign∣ty,
and his creatures duty, he continues his Law. They that take
power of command from it, divest him of his Sovereignty, and
exempt the creature from duty. I know there are many evasi∣ons,
if it might be to shuffle off, and evade this doctrine; if not
wholly denying the Law, yet weakening the power of it in Gos∣pel-time.</P>
<P>Some say, <HI>that it bindes us as creatures, but not as Christi∣ans.</HI>
And then it is to be feared, that they taking themselves
to be above creatures in that they are Christians, being raised in
a neerer relation to God, then meer creatures, they will take
themselves to be disobliged▪ But if the creature be cast into hell,
for transgression; as a drunkard, an adulterer, a covetous
person, what will become of the Christian? But it bindes both
as creatures and Christians, Christ having put his sanction up∣on
it.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="49"/>
Others say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law bindes the whole of man.</NOTE> that it bindes the <HI>unregenerate part of man, but not
the regenerate part, that is free. Paul</HI> delighted in the Law of
God after the inward man, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 22. That is, as Interpreters
understand, so f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rre as regenerate; How could he delight in it as
a Law, and not subject to it? It seems these think that only wick∣ed
ones are bound, or rather wickednesse to be alone obliged; It
will shortly be a mark of unregeneration (as it seemes it is with
some already) to be subject to it; They that urge it upon men,
and presse it as their duty, have the name of legal Preachers, and
stranger, from Gospel-mysteries put upon them. It is a weari∣some
thing to rake further in this puddle; I hope it is plain in
that which hath been said, that God holds up this part of his So∣vereignty
in keeping up his commandment, the authority of his
Moral Precepts in the hearts of his people.</P>

<P><HI>AS God keeps up his Law for a Rule to his people, so it is a

commended, as raising Christians to an higher perfection, then e∣ver

<HI>joyne) affirme, that Christ hath instituted new precepts of obedi∣ence
in the Gospel; and added them to the commands of the
Law, such as transcend and exceed all that were delivered in Old
Testament times.</HI> Gerrard <HI>having disputed for the perfection
of the Law against</HI> Papists, <HI>cap.</HI> 14. De Evangelio, <HI>saith,</HI> The

Popish opinion of new Laws promulgated by Christ, <HI>the Pho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inians
(which is an other name of</HI> Socinians) greedily embrace; making
a fair way for <HI>Mahometisme,</HI> seeing that in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> it is in like

and <HI>Mahomet</HI> most perfect of all. Gerrard <HI>quotes this passage
out of the</HI> Cracovian <HI>Chatechisme in the same chapter.</HI> Christ
came not only to fulfil the Law for us, but added new precepts to it.
These new precepts, (<HI>the same Authour saith</HI>) they make twofold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Some of which do appertain to manners, some to ceremonies, or outward
rites in worship. <HI>He names three that appertaine to manners:</HI> To
deny a mans self; take up his Crosse, and follow Christ: <HI>Which
three precepts my Authour in way of opposition saith,</HI> belong to
the first commandment. Peltius <HI>in his Harmony of</HI> Arminians <HI>and</HI>
Socinians, <HI>chap. 4, 5, 6. sheweth their combination against the Or∣thodox
party, as in many other things, so in this proposition now
controverted. He there quotes from</HI> Socinians <HI>these positions:</HI>
That Christ in the New Testament did not only abrogate the Cere∣monial
and Judicial Law, but did much encrease and adde unto the
Moral Law: That he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it;
which fulfilling (<HI>saith he</HI>) is nothing else but a perfecting of it, and
addition of what was wanting: That we ought not only to observe
those things that are given us of God, and not abrogated by Christ,
but those precepts in like manner that are added by Christ. <HI>Much
more from many</HI> Socinians, <HI>and</HI> Arminians, <HI>may be seen in that
Authour to that purpose. Dr.</HI> Hammond <HI>in his Practical Cate∣chisme,
speaking of Christs Sermon in the Mount, agrees indeed
with the</HI> Papists, <HI>against the</HI> Protestants, That Christ doth not here
expound <HI>Moses,</HI> and vindicate the Law from false glosses, but that he
addes to the Law, <HI>and names many additions to the sixth, seventh,
and other Commandments, but dissents from them, in that they
make these Evangelical Counsels, and makes them precepts, not
precepts of</HI> Moses, <HI>but of</HI> Christ, <HI>added by him to the Law: but,
this with much modesty, as though he would not be peremptory
in his opinion. So that</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Authorities vouchsafed for the perfection of the Moral Law as a Rule.</NOTE> <HI>Mr.</HI> Burges, <HI>page 166. handling con∣troversies
about the Law, saith,</HI> I shall now handle the perfection of it,
and labour to shew that Christ hath instituted no new duty, which
was not commanded before by the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> And this question,
(<HI>saith he</HI>) will be profitable, partly against the <HI>Arminians,</HI> partly the
<HI>Papists,</HI> and lastly, the <HI>Socinians. He further saith,</HI> page 169.
<PB N="64" REF="50"/>
That Christ did not adde, new duties which were not commanded in
the Law, because the Law is perfect, and they were bound not to add to
it, or detract from it, Therefore we are not to conceive a more excellent
way of duty, then that prescribed. Further, if we speak of holy and
spiritual duties, there cannot be a more excellent way of holinesse

(<HI>i.e. Adams</HI>) fall, continued to be a perfect Rule of Righteousnesse,
and as such was delivered by God on mount <HI>Sinai</HI> in ten Command∣ments;
<HI>To these more might be added, but these are
sufficient to shew the great consent of Protestant Wri∣ters.</HI></P>
<P>But I shall not rest barely upon the authority of these testi∣monies,
but also offer to consideration these following Rea∣sons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments e∣vincing the perfection of the Moral Law.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. If the Law be not a fully perfect, and compleat Rule of
our lives, then there is some sinne against God which is not con∣demned
in the Law, This is clear; Deviation from any rule given
of God, is a sin: Deviation from that, supposed additional rule,
is a sin; But there is no sin which the Law doth not condemn; <HI>Sin
is a transgression of the Law,</HI> 1 John 3, 4. <HI>He that sins, transgresseth
the Law.</HI></P>
<P>2. If the Law alone discovers and makes sinne known, then it
is a perfect, full, and compleat Rule; this is plain: <HI>Omne rectum
index est obliqui.</HI> But the Law alone discovers sinne, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 20.
This office is ascribed there to the Law, which is no other but the
Moral Law. Had not the light of that Rule guided the Apostle
in this work, he had never made any such discovery: And it is the
moral Law written in the decalogue that he means, as appears in
the quotation; <HI>I had not known lust, except the Law had said, Thou
shalt not covet.</HI></P>
<P>3. That which alone works wrath, is the alone Rule and guide
of our lives. This is clear, in what sense soever it is, that we take
working of wrath: whether we understand it of working of
wrath in man against God, as some do; Mans heart being apt to
rise against him that will exercise Sovereignty over him, Or of the
wrath of God kindled against man; upon transgression of the Law.
But it is the Law that works wrath: it is ascribed to it, and it alone,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 15.</P>
<P>4. That which being removed will take away all possibili∣ty
of sinning, that is alone the Rule of our obedience: This
is plain; were there any Rule, the transgression of it would be
<PB N="96" REF="51"/>
still our sinne. But the Law being removed, all possibility of
sin is taken away: <HI>Where there is no Law, there is no transgression,</HI>
Rom. 4. 15.</P>
<P>5. If the Law only addes strength to sinne, <HI>viz.</HI> for condem∣nation,
then the Law is the alone rule of obedience: This
is plaine; Any other Rule whatsoever addes like strength to
sinne, and upon transgression will condemne. But the Law
only addes strength to sinne, 1 <HI>Cor. 15. 56. The strength of sin is
the Law.</HI></P>
<P>6. Either the epithite <HI>[moral]</HI> is not justly given to the Law;
or else it is a perfect Rule of manners, that is, of obedience:
This is plaine, for moral denotes, as <HI>Amesius</HI> observes, that
use of it. But this epithite given to the Law, and appropriated to it,
was never (as I think) upon any such account challenged. <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P>7. Either this new Rule doth transcend the old Rule of the
Moral Law; requiring a more exact degree of perfection, as
<HI>Papists</HI> speak of their evangelical counsels, and <HI>Socinians</HI> of their
additional Gospel precepts, or else it falls short and admits of
obedience in a degree more low. If it require obedience more
high, then even the doers of the Law, in the greatest height and
possible supposed perfection; though equal to the Angels, are
sinners: The Law might be fulfilled, and yet disobedience
charged. If it fall short of the old Rule (which it seemes is the
opinion of some who confesse an imperfection in our personal
righteousnesse, as it refers to the old Rule; and assert a perfecti∣on,
as it relates to the new Rule) then the new Rule allows that
which the old Rule condemnes, and so they bring in a discrepancy
between them and finde an allowance for transgression. So that
I think, I have sufficient authourity, divine and humane, with rea∣sons
that are cogent, to conclude that which I have asserted, That
the old Rule, the Rule of the Moral Law, is a perfect Rule, and the
only Rule.</P>
<P>Six several exceptions are taken against the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Exceptions taken against the perfection of the Law.</NOTE> perfecti∣on
of this Law, or singularity of it, as a rule by a learned
hand.</P>
<P>1. It is demanded, <HI>What say you for matter of duty, to the positive</HI>

In case we break the commandments in the neglect
of them, then the commandment requires the observation of
them. For which Master <HI>Burges</HI> Vindiciae Legis <HI>page 149. Balls</HI>
Catechisme, <HI>Amesius</HI> his Sciographia, <HI>Dod</HI> on the command∣ments,
<HI>Downhams</HI> Tables, <HI>Zanchy,</HI> each of them on this com∣mandment;
and <HI>Cawdry</HI> and <HI>Palmer</HI> on the Sabbath, <HI>Part. 2.
Pag.</HI> 176. may be consulted. For further clearing of this
point, we must consider of the preceptive part of the Moral
Law, which alone in this place is our businesse to enquire af∣ter,
1. As it is <HI>epitomized</HI> in the Decalogue, those <HI>ten words,</HI>
as <HI>Moses</HI> calls them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34. 28. Or else, as <HI>commented upon,</HI> and
more amply delivered in the whole Book of the Law, Prophets,
and Scriptures of the New Testament. 2. We must distinguish
of the manner how the Law prescribes, or commands any
thing as duty, which is either <HI>expresly,</HI> or <HI>Synecdochically,</HI> ei∣ther
<HI>directly,</HI> or else <HI>interpretatively, virtually, and reductively;</HI>
I very well know, that the Law is not in all particulars so ex∣plicitely,
and expresly delivered, but that, 1. The use, and best
improvement of reason is required to know, what <HI>pro hic &amp;
nunc</HI> is called for at our hands for duty. The Law layes down
rules in affirmative precepts, in an indefinite way, which we
must bring home by particular application, discerning by gene∣ral
Scripture Rules, with the help of reason (which sometimes is
not so easie to be done) when it speaks to us in a way of con∣cernment,
as to present practical observation. 2. That hints
of providence are to be observed, to know what in present is
duty, as to the affirmative part of the commandment of God.
If that man, that fell among theeves, between <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and
<HI>Jericho,</HI> had sate by the way, on the green grasse, without any
appearance of harme, or present need of help, the <HI>Samaritane</HI>
that passed that way, had not offended, in case he had taken
no more notice, then the Priest and Levite did: But discerning
<PB N="68" REF="52"/>
him that case, as he then was, the sixth commandment called
for that, which he then did, as a present office of love to his
neighbour, according to the interpretation of this command∣ment
given by our Saviour, <HI>Mark</HI> 3. 4. When the Pharisees
watched him, whether he would heale the man with the wither∣ed
hand on the Sabbath day, He demands of them, <HI>Is it
lawful to do good on the Sabbath day, or to do evil, To save
life, or to destroy?</HI> It was not their minde that Christ should
kill the man, onely they would not have had him, then to have
cur'd him: But not to cure when it is in our power, according
to Christs interpretation, is to kill. If diligent observation be
not made, the commandment may be soone transgress'd.
3. Skill in Sciences, and professions is to be improved by men
of skill, that the commandment may be kept. The Samaritane
poured wine and oyle into the travellers wounds, knowing
that to be of use, to supple and refresh them. Had he known
any other thing more sovereigne, which might have been had,
at hand; he was to have used it. As skill in medicines is to be
used for preservation of mens lives, so also skill in the Laws, by
those that are vers'd in them, for the help of their neighbour, in
exigents; concerning his estate and livelihood. 4. We must
listen to Gods mouth, to learne when he shall be pleased at any
time further to manifest his minde for the clearing of our way
in any of his precepts. There was a command, concerning
the place of publick, and solemn worship, <HI>Deut. 12. 5. Vnto
the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your Tribes
to put his Name there, even to his habitation shall ye seek, and thi∣ther
shalt thou come,</HI> Now thou must depend on the mouth of
God, to observe what place in any of the Tribes; he would
choose for his habitation. When God commands, that all
instituted worship shall be according to his prescript; This is a
perfect Rule implicite, and virtual; tying us to heed the Lord
at any time, more particularly discovering his will, and clear∣ing
this duty to us. Was not the Law of worship perfect, to
<HI>Abraham,</HI> unlesse it explicitely told him that he must sacrifice his
Sonne? And if any take themselves to be so acute, as to set up
a new Rule, as some are pleased to stile it, then they antiquate
and abolish the old Rule, and singularly gratifie the <HI>An∣tinomian</HI>
party. Two Rules will no more stand together
<PB N="69" REF="52"/>
then two covenants; calling it a new Rule, men make the first
old: Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is <HI>ready to vanish
away,</HI> Heb. 8. 17. It is added moreover, <HI>doth not the Scripture call
Christ our Lawgiver,</HI> and say the Law shall go out of <HI>Zion,</HI> &amp;c.
<HI>Isa.</HI> 2. 3. And was not the old Law his? Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> I am sure,
quotes that which belongs to the preceptive part of the Moral
Law, and calls it the <HI>Law of Christ,</HI> Gal. 6. 2. His Laws were de∣livered
in the wildernesse, whom the people of <HI>Israel</HI> there tempt∣ed
and provoked; This is plain, for they sinn'd against the Law∣giver,
and from his hands they suffered. And who they tempted
in the wildernesse, see from the Apostles hand, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 9. And
as to the Scripture quoted, the words are exegetically set down in
those that follow them. <HI>The Law shall go out of Zion, and the Word of
the Lord out of Jerusalem:</HI> Which is no more, but that the Name of
the Lord, which was then known in <HI>Judah,</HI> shall be great from the
rising of the Sun, to the going down thereof. It is further demand∣ed,
<HI>And is he not the anointed King of the Church, and therfore hath le∣gislative
power?</HI> For answer, I desire to know what King the Church
had, when the old Law was, before Christ came in the flesh?
The Kingdom was one and the same, and the King one and the
same then, and now, as I take it. <HI>Many shall come from the East, and
West, and shall sit down with</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>in the king∣dom
of heaven.</HI> The Gentiles coming in at the Gospel-call, are un∣der
the same King, and in the same Kingdom. And if all this were
granted which is here pleaded for, it is no more then a change in
some positive, circumstantial Rites, and what is this to the question
handled by our Authour; <HI>That our righteousnesse which is imper∣fect
according to the old Rule, is perfect according to the new?</HI> when
old and new in that which is naturally Moral, is one and the same.
When the Law required heart-service, and love with the whole
heart, upon spiritual ends and motives, upon which account all
fell short in their obedience, and performance, shall we say that
Christ did dispense with any of this, that so the Rule being lower,
our obedience now may answer. Others that make <HI>Moses</HI> and
Christ two distinct Law-givers and agents for God, in holding out
distinct precepts, give the pre-eminence to Christ, and account his
Law to be of more eminent perfection. This Authour on the con∣trary
seems to make the Laws of Christ to stoop far beneath those
of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="53"/>
2. <HI>For Justification of this accusation of the Moral Law of
imperfection,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Exception.</NOTE> <HI>it is added,</HI> the Moral, taken either for the Law given
to <HI>Adam,</HI> or written in Tables of stone, is not a sufficient rule for us
now, for beleeving in Jesus Christ, no nor the same Law of nature as
still in force under Christ. For a general command of beleeving all
that God revealeth, is not the only rule of our faith, but the particular
revelation and precept are part, &amp;c. <HI>To this I say,</HI></P>
<P>1. As before, I think I may answer out of his own mouth,
where he says, <HI>Neglect of Sacraments is a breach of the second com∣mandment,
and unbelief is a breach of the first.</HI> If we break the
commandment in unbelief, then the Commandment bindes us to
believe.</P>
<P>2. Much of that which I have spoke by way of answer to the
former, may be applied to this likewise.</P>
<P>3. I shall hereafter speak to this, that faith is a duty of the Mo∣ral
Law, where the Reader may have further satisfaction.</P>
<P>4. If <HI>Adam</HI> had no command for faith, then he was not in any
capacity to believe, and by his fall lost not power of beleeving:
And consequently it will not stand with the Justice of God to ex∣act
it at our hands, having never had power for the performance
of it.</P>
<P>5. I say, there was power in <HI>Adam,</HI> for that <HI>faith that justified,</HI>
but not to <HI>act for justification. Adam</HI> had that habit, and the Law
calls for it, from all that are under the command of it: But the
Gospel discovers the object by which a sinner through faith is
justified.</P>
<P>3. The same answer may serve to the third exception, which indeed
is the same with the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Exception.</NOTE> only a great deal of flourishing is be∣stowed,
in discourse of the understanding and will, paralleling
them with the Prefaces, grounds and occasions of Laws, not need∣ful
to be repeated. And at last bringing all to the Articles of the
Creed, to which enough already is spoken.</P>
<P>4. It is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4, Exception.</NOTE> <HI>But what if all this had been left out, and you had
proved the Moral Law the only Rule of duty? doth it follow therefore
that it is the only Rule? Answ.</HI> If the Moral Law be the only Rule
of duty, then I take it to be the only Rule; for I enquire after no∣thing
but duty, and I take righteousnesse to be matter of duty,
and then the only Rule of duty, is the only Rule of righteousnesse.
It is further said, <HI>Sure it is not the only Rule of rewarding.</HI> And I say,
<PB N="71" REF="53"/>
Rewarding is none of our work, but Gods, and I look for a Rule
of that work which is ours, and that we are to make our businesse,
I confesse an imperfection in it, to give life, but assert a perfection
as the Rule of our lives, It justifies no man, but it orders and regu∣lates
every justified man.</P>
<P>5. It is further said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Exception.</NOTE> <HI>The same I may say of the Rule of punishment.</HI>
To which I give the same answer: It is not our work, but Gods,
either to reward or punish. And here he speaks of a part of the
penalty of the new Law, And I know no penalty properly distinct
from the penalty of the old. He is wont to compare it to an Act
of Oblivion, and Acts of Oblivion are not wont to inflict penalties,
but serve to remove them when another Law imposes them. That
of the Parable is instanced, <HI>None of them that were bidden shall taste
of the Supper;</HI> when the sin for which they there suffer is a breach
of a Moral command.</P>
<P>6. It is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6. Exception.</NOTE> <HI>The principal thing intended is, that the Moral Law
is not the only Rule, what shall be the condition of Life or Death, and
therefore not the only Rule according to which we must now be denomi∣nated,
and hereafter sentenced, Just or Vnjust.</HI> To this I have already
given a sufficient answer, and if I had not, our Authour answers
fully for me, where he says, <HI>The precepts of the Covenant, as meer
precepts, must be distinguished from the same precepts considered as
conditions, upon performance of which we must live, or die for non-per∣formance?</HI>
And I speak of them as meer precepts, and so they are
our Rule of righteousness, &amp; not as they are conditions either of the
covenant of works or grace. And a man may be denominated righ∣teous,
by the Laws Rule, when he cannot stand before the sentence
of it as a covenant, of which we have heard sufficient. After a
long discourse against all possibility of justification by the Law of
works, as though I were therein an adversary; or that the <HI>Anti∣nomian</HI>
fancy were above all answer; that a man cannot make the
Law his Rule, but he makes it withal his Justification, he goes about
to prevent an objection, and says, <HI>If you should say, this is the cove∣nant
and not the Law,</HI> he will reply. 1. <HI>Then the Law is not the on∣ly
Rule.</HI> To which I say, When my work is to make it good,
that the Law is our only Rule, I marvel that he will so much as
imagine, that I will say that which makes it not the only Rule.
But perhaps, he thinks I do not see, how it cannot follow, as in∣deed
I do not, neither can I see any colour for it. 2. He replies, <HI>It
<PB N="72" REF="54"/>
is the same thing in several respects, that we call a Law and a
Covenant (except you mean it of our covenant-act to God, of which
we speak not) who knows not that</HI> praemiare, <HI>and</HI> punire <HI>are Acts of
a Law? And that an Act of Oblivion or general pardon on certaine
termes is a Law, and that the promise is the principal part of the Law
of Grace.</HI> To which <HI>I</HI> say, that <HI>praemiare</HI> and <HI>punire</HI> are essential
in a Law. Some have power of command, so that their words in
just things is to be a Law, where most deny any power of punish∣ment;
as an Husband over the Wife. Some parents have Autho∣rity
to command children, (children remaining under the obliga∣tion
of the fifth commandment as long as the relation of a childe
continueth) when they have neither power to reward or punish.
<HI>Jacob</HI> took himself to be in power, to command <HI>Joseph</HI> (among the
rest of his Sons, as appears in the charge concerning his burial,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 47. 29, 30. and <HI>chap.</HI> 49. 29. So compared) and yet he was not
in power either to reward or punish him. And though they be acts
of a law where he that gives the Law is in power; Yet they are no
parts of a Rule, nor any directory of life to him to whom they
are proposed. <HI>I</HI> know that an Act of Oblivion or general par∣don
may be called a Law, as many other things are, <HI>catachresticè</HI>
and <HI>abusivè;</HI> but that it should be a Law properly so called, <HI>I</HI>
know not. The <HI>Romanes</HI> defined a Law, whilest that a <HI>Democratie</HI>
was in force among them, to be <HI>Generale jussum populi, aut plebis
rogante magistratu.</HI> Afterwards when the State was changed, and
the Legislative power was in other hands, they defined it to be,
<HI>Jussum Regis aut Imperatoris.</HI> And <HI>Tully's</HI> definition of a Law
is, that it is, <HI>Ratio summa insita in natura, quae recta suadet, pro∣hibetque
contraria.</HI> Here <HI>jussio, suasio,</HI> and <HI>prohibitio</HI> are express'd,
which are not found in Acts of Oblivion. That every man, who
is within the verge of such an Act, may be said to be acquit by
Law, <HI>I</HI> willingly grant; seeing that act takes off the force of the
Law condemning him: But that it is a Law, strictly so taken, <HI>I</HI>
know not.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Moral Law bindes, as it was delivered by the
hand of Moses.</HEAD>
<P>A Third branch of the general Proposition before delivered
follows, which is, <HI>that the Moral Law, as delivered by the
hand of</HI> Moses, <HI>is obligatory to Christians;</HI> This I confesse is more
disputable, then either of the former before spoken to; In those,
we had to deale with <HI>Antinomians,</HI> on the one hand; <HI>Papists,
Arminians, Socinians,</HI> on the other hand, with some few others
that are pleased in those points alone to strike in, with <HI>Arminians</HI>
and <HI>Socinians,</HI> and in other things to oppose them: But
in this <HI>Papists</HI> agree not among themselves, but one is against an∣other;
neither is there that agreement amongst <HI>Protestant</HI> Writers
that might be desired, which must not be concealed; some are
for the affirmative, and some for the negative, and some
seem to stand in a neutral indifferency. <HI>Bellarmine</HI> among the
<HI>Papists,</HI> is for the affirmative, <HI>lib. 4. de justificatione, cap.</HI> 6. and
takes up <HI>Soto</HI> for the contrary tenent, who affirmes (as he quotes
him) that <HI>Christians are not only delivered from the Ceremonial Law,
and the guilt and terror, of the moral Law, but from the whole Law, as
written in the books of</HI> Moses, with this caution (as he reports him)
<HI>that we are to keep the Law of</HI> Moses <HI>as it is natural, and as it is in the
Gospel, and in the Epistles of the Apostles, but not as it was written by</HI>
Moses; <HI>for</HI> Moses (saith he) <HI>could not binde us, but it is Christ that
bindes us, for we are Christians and not Jews. Soto</HI> hath <HI>Suarez,</HI>
and <HI>Medina</HI> (as Master <HI>Burges</HI> observes) with him, and a∣mong
the Protestants, <HI>Zanchius de redemptione lib. 1. cap.</HI> 12. and
<HI>Musculus</HI> in his common places go the same way, affirming, <HI>that
the Moral Lawes which go under the name of the decalogue, as
they were delivered by</HI> Moses <HI>to the</HI> Israelites, <HI>do not concerne Chri∣stians,
but as they are agreeable to the Law of nature, and confirmed
by Christ. Paraeus</HI> (as is observed by <HI>Rivet</HI> in his Explication,
of the Decalogue, page 11.) giving in his judgement of the dif∣fering
opinions of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> and <HI>Soto, affirms</HI> that the opinion
<PB N="74" REF="55"/>
of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> is most safe to be followed. <HI>Rivet</HI> himself, in the
place quoted, takes it to be a strife of words, and the difference
to be inconsiderable; and in case the authority be granted, there
seemes indeed lesse danger, though the Minister be waved. The
Antinomian (as others have observed) is by both parties op∣posed;
Some may think, that the Law, thus gaines in its autho∣rity,
in as much, as Christ is, of much more excellency then <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI>
when the Master of the Vineyard, saw his servant neglected;
he said, <HI>They will reverence my Sonne,</HI> Mat. 21. 37. But if the
servant be once despised, and set so light by, as we read from some
hands, <HI>Away with stammering Moses,</HI> it may be feared, that the
Sonne will not long remaine in honour, when servants fared so
ill, we finde that the Sonne had little better entertainment; And,
in my thoughts, there is scarce a readier way then this, to strip
us of the whole of the Law of God. Keeping up to their own
principles, they can look on no more, of the Law, as binding
Christians, then that which is held out to us, in New Testament-Scriptures.
If this be granted, we must have a New Testament
Text, for every Moral duty; yet to gratifie adversaries in this
particular, we may safely yeeld, that the Law concernes not
Christians, as it was delivered by <HI>Moses,</HI> only to the <HI>Israelites,</HI>
and so <HI>Zanchy's</HI> Position, keeping strictly to the termes may
happily be defended. <HI>The Moral Laws as delivered by</HI> Moses <HI>to the</HI>
Israelites <HI>do not appertain to Christians;</HI> so, neither doth <HI>Lukes</HI>
Gospel, or the history of the <HI>Acts,</HI> as from him to <HI>Theophilus,</HI>
nor yet, any of <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles, as from him, to any particular
Church, or to <HI>Timothy, Titus,</HI> or <HI>Philemon.</HI> But looking on
<HI>Moses</HI> as employed of God, with his Church, with which he was
in the Wildernesse, <HI>Acts</HI> 7. 38. and upon his writings as a <HI>deposi∣tum,</HI>
left with the Church, they are of equal concernment, to us,
as they were to the Jews, if we be as the Church of the Jewes
was, a Church of God. This to me is plaine, not only by those
Texts of <HI>Moses</HI> quoted in New Testament-Scriptures, as we heard
before, but quoted also as from <HI>Moses.</HI> The Apostle pleading for
Ministers maintenance, saith, <HI>For it is written in the Law of</HI> Mo∣ses,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 9. How were this argument of force, if <HI>Moses</HI> his
writings were not of use? That of <HI>Peter</HI> is convincing, 1 Pet. 1.
15, 16. <HI>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in
all manner of conversation; because it is written, be ye holy for I
<PB N="75" REF="55"/>
am holy;</HI> This was written by <HI>Moses,</HI> Lev. 11. 44. Lev. 19. 2.
Lev. 20. 7. and why should we be engaged to holinesse, <HI>eo no∣mine,</HI>
because <HI>Moses</HI> writ it, and gave it in charge, in case <HI>Moses</HI>
his writings do not binde Christians? This also to me is plaine,
in reason, Christ was King then, as now, his Church is the same,
now, as then, we, and they make up one Kingdome, <HI>Matth.</HI>
8. 11. The Lawes of Christ therefore (unlesse they appear to be
repealed) are now, in force as in former times. There is not a
temporal Obligation (saith Master <HI>Burges Vindiciae Legis,</HI> page
162.) laid upon a perpetual duty. The duties are confessed,
to be perpetual, why should <HI>Moses</HI> then deliver them to be only
of temporal permanency? Neither is there any thing brought by
<HI>Soto,</HI> or any other hand to evince the contrary. In the close of
the words already quoted, he sayes, <HI>Mose-could not binde us, but
Christ, for we are not Jews, but Christians,</HI> To this we say, He
could not binde us, authoritatively, but ministerially, and because
<HI>Christ</HI> bindes, therefore <HI>Moses</HI> bindes; seeing, <HI>Moses</HI> was a ser∣vant,
in that house, where Christ was a Sonne, Christ was King
of his Church, in <HI>Moses</HI> his dayes, <HI>Israel</HI> tempted Christ in diso∣beying
<HI>Moses, 1 Cor.</HI> 10. 9. He commanded for Christ, when he
gave command to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and these commands are of con∣cernment
unto Christians, who are their fellow subjects. The
Arguments produced by <HI>Soto</HI> are satisfyingly answered by <HI>Bel∣larmine.
Soto</HI> saith, that the Preface of the law leads to the <HI>Israelites</HI>
onely, <HI>I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, and out of the house of bondage.</HI> But it was the Jews, and
not Christians, that were in <HI>Egypt.</HI> This is false, as one of these Je∣suites
truly answers the other, we were in <HI>Egypt</HI> as well as the Na∣tion
of the Jews; They were our fathers, and we their children,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 1. It was once indeed otherwise with us, being branches
of the wilde Olive; But the natural branches, being cut off, we
are grafted into their stead, that mercy of deliverance from <HI>Egypt,</HI>
being a Church-mercy, is our mercy. He further objects that of
<HI>Luke 16. 16. The Law and the Prophets were until</HI> John, and is
answered, that, that is understood of the Law, prophecying by fi∣gures,
and not instructing in manners, which is further explained,
<HI>Matth. 11. 13. For all the Prophets and the Law prophecyed until
John,</HI> that is, all the prophesies of the Messiah to come, whether
delivered in words by the Prophets, or by signes and Law-cere∣monies
<PB N="76" REF="56"/>
did not reach beyond <HI>John,</HI> who was the last of the Pro∣phets,
who did bear witnesse of Christ. Some say, that in case the
Law bind, as it was delivered by <HI>Moses;</HI> then all that <HI>Moses</HI> did
deliver, is obligatory to Christians, <HI>Quâtale,</HI> is, <HI>omne,</HI> and so the ce∣remonial Law, bindes, as doth the Moral, and we shall bring our
necks under that yoke. To this answer, all that <HI>Moses</HI> did deliver
doth binde, unlesse we have a release, or discharge from the same
authority, by which he spake, and hence an argument is drawn,
for proof of that which we have in hand, If the ceremonial Law
had bound Christians to this day, had it not been revoked, and
abolished, then the moral Law, which is no where revoked, or a∣bolished
(as hath been shewn) doth still bind Christians. This is
plaine, there is no reason, that the ceremonial Law should be obli∣gatory,
above the Moral; But the ceremonial Law had bound
Christians to this day, had it not been revoked and abolished;
This is as plain, when the great question was, in the primitive times,
whether the ceremonial Law did binde Christians, whether they
were to circumcise their children, after the manner of <HI>Moses;</HI> and
consequently to observe other Rites. This is decided, in making it
appear, that these were abolished, as being shadows of good
things to come, and an end put to their obligation. It may be
further objected, that if all be of force, that <HI>Moses</HI> wrote, as from
him, then that of divorce of the wife, on any cause is of force like∣wise.
That was commanded by <HI>Moses,</HI> as the Pharisees, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. 7.
tell the Lord Christ from <HI>Deut.</HI> 24. 1. To this <HI>Chemnitius</HI> hath an∣swered,
that <HI>Moses</HI> delivered this, <HI>Tanquam legislator,</HI> as one,
that gave orders to that people, as, to their political estate; not,
<HI>Tanquam Theologus,</HI> as a Prophet, raised up to deliver the minde
and will of God unto them. <HI>Moses</HI> his writings therefore are
in force, not onely <HI>ratione materiae,</HI> as <HI>containing such precepts up∣on
which Christ in the New Testament hath put a divine sanction;</HI>
but by vertue of a sanction from heaven put upon them, as deli∣vered
by him, and the obligation still remaining. If <HI>Moses</HI> once
be neglected, I shall fear, that <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> will not long be ho∣noured,
<HI>Moses</HI> being a servant in the same house, with them, and
the rest of the Apostles, and pen-men of New Testament-Scrip∣tures.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">God entring a Covenant of Grace with his people, keeps
up his Sovereignty in exercise of discipline,
in the correction and chastisement of his
people for sinne.</HEAD>
<P>AS God holds up his Sovereignty, under the covenant of
grace; in keeping on foot his commandments; so, also in
his exercise of discipline, upon those, with whom he is in cove∣nant.
He neither suffers them to be without Law, nor to go on
in transgression of his Law, with impunity and freedome. As
they have his precept, to keep from sinne, so they are in danger,
of his hand, in case of sinne; Those that are against us in the for∣mer,
are our adversaries in this likewise. As they plead a ma∣numission,
of Christians from the mandatory power of the Law,
so, they will also have them exempted from all chastisement or cor∣rection.
Against these we maintaine that the people of God in
covenant, even those, whose hearts are stedfast, in covenant; do
suffer under the covenant of grace, in case of sinne, and that for
sinne; For proofe of this, I shall bring Scripture of three
sorts.</P>
<P>1. Giving instances, of the Church and people of God; un∣der
sore and great afflictions for sinne, and these places are even
without number, <HI>Esay 42. 24. Lam. 1. 8. 3. 39. 5. 16. Micah</HI> 1. 5.
Yea, they lie under sufferings, till they acknowledge sin, till their
stomacks are brought down, and they humble themselves for sin,
<HI>Lev.</HI> 26. 41. Against this, is objected, that among these afflicted
ones, there were reprobates, as well as elected ones; and Elect
ones in the state of unconversion, and they might suffer for sinne,
which the childe of God does not, nor can not; To this I an∣swer;
1. There were true converts among these, or else the
whole world had no converts in it. 2. These, in their confessions,
and humiliations, involved themselves among the rest; and make
themselves, of the number of those, that by sinne draw down
sufferings; as we have <HI>Ezra, Daniel,</HI> and others for examples.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="57"/>
2. Instances of the most precious Saints sinning and suffering
for sinne; 1. <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> Numb. 20. 12. <HI>The Lord spake unto
Moses and Aaron, because, ye beleeved me not, to sanctifie me in the
eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this Con∣gregation
into the land which I have given them;</HI> Both their sinne
and their sufferings, are noted there, which <HI>Moses</HI> seems never to
have done with, <HI>Deut. 1. 37. Deut. 3 26. Deut. 4. 21. Deut. 34. 4.
2. David,</HI> his sinne we finde, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. at large related, his
sufferings, in the next chapter, he suffers in all his relations, 1. As,
a father, his childe dies. 2. As, an husband, his bed is defiled.
3. As, a Prince, the sword is brought upon his land. 3. <HI>Solomon,</HI>
1 Kings 11. 11. <HI>For as much, as this is done of thee, and thou hast
not kept my Covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded
thee, I will surely rend the Kingdom from thee, and I will give it to
thy servant. 4. Hezekiah,</HI> 2 Chron. 32. 25. 26. <HI>But</HI> Hezekiah
<HI>rendred not again according to the benefit done unto him, for his
heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon
Judah and Jerusalem. Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled him∣self,
for the pride of his heart, both, he, and the inhabitants of Je∣rusalem,
so that the wrath of the Lord, came not upon them, in the
dayes of Hezekiah.</HI> In which words we see, his sinne, his suffer∣ing
for sinne, and his humiliation upon account of his sinne. Here
also exception is taken; These here mentioned say some, lived
under Old Testament dispentations; To this I answer. 1. We
may take up <HI>Pauls</HI> words in behalf of these, 2. <HI>Cor. 10. 7. If any
man trust to himself, that he is Christs, let him of himself, think
this again, that, as he is Christs, so they were Christs. Moses,</HI> that
suffered (as we have heard) upon the account of sinne, <HI>esteem∣ed
the reproach of Christ greater riches, then the treasures of E∣gypt,</HI>
Heb. 11. 26. And <HI>David</HI> that suffered in like sort, in spi∣rit
called him Lord, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 43. 2. That we may not lose
Old Testament-Scriptures, for if we lose them here, we shall
hold them no where, let us look upon <HI>Prov. 3. 11, 12. My sonne,
despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his cor∣rection,
for, whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth, even as the father
the sonne, in whom he delighteth.</HI> In which words we see, 1. The
sufferings of the people of God thrice repeated. 2. The impul∣sive
cause, implyed in the word [chastisement] which ever is
for some fault, <HI>Psalme</HI> 39. 11. 3. The hand that inflicts
<PB N="79" REF="57"/>
[the Lord] 4. His way of dealing as a [Father] in love and
not in vengeance. Now turne to <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 5, 6, 7. and there we
shall see the Apostle. 1. Quoting this Scripture. 2. Checking
them for not heeding it. 3. Commenting upon it; <HI>Ye have for∣gotten
the exhortation, which speaketh unto you, as unto children,
My sonne despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
thou art rebuked of him; For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth; If ye endure chastening,
God dealeth with you, as with sonnes, for what sonne is he whom
the Father chasteneth not?</HI> These words of the Apostle, confirm
all the Old Testament proofs before mentioned, give a shrewd
check, to all those that would cast them off, and are a full New
Testament-proof of the point in hand, our aversaries tell us, that
the children of God, in New Testament-times, have that great
and happy priviledge, to be free from all chastisements for sinne,
The Apostle, on the other hand sayes, that, it is their happinesse
to be chastised, and would be their sorrow, if they were without
chastisement. <HI>For this cause</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>many are weak,
and sickly among you, and many sleep,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 30. There, we see,
judgements inflicted, the persons suffering, and the cause of suf∣fering
assigned. The judgements are set out. 1. By the qua∣lity
or kinde, such as were visible on the outward man; as, their
sinne was open, so was their suffering. 2. By their several de∣grees,
in which they suffered; some weak, languishing, under in∣firmities;
some sick, taken with diseases; some fallen asleep, sur∣prised
with death. The persons suffering are set out. 1. By
their multitude [<HI>many</HI>]. 2. By the application of the stroke,
<HI>Corinthians</HI> had sinned, and <HI>Corinthians</HI> suffered. The cause is
implyed in the illative particle [For] and exprest in the forego∣ing
words, their unworthy addresses unto the Lords Table, sin∣fully
eating and drinking, they eat and drink their own judgement,
and though it cannot be said, that all were in grace, that thus
suffered, yet there were some at least in grace among them, in that
the Lord chastened them in the world, that they might not be
condemned with the world. The Lord Christ speaks fully to this
in his letter from heaven to <HI>Laodicea</HI> the Church of, Rev. 3. 19.
<HI>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.</HI></P>
<P>As Scripture, expresly holds out this truth, so, it is also clear
in reason, if God should not hold up his Sovereignty, in this way
<PB N="80" REF="58"/>
of exercise of discipline; upon his children, his love could not
be continued to them, but would be withdrawn from them, as
we see in Christs words but now mentioned, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 19. as, al∣so
in those words of <HI>Solomon</HI> and the Apostle, <HI>Pro. 3. 11. Heb.</HI> 12.
5, 6, 7. The love of God is such to his children, and such a
league of friendship is past between them (say our adversaries)
that it will not suffer him to strike them. We say, his love is
such, that he cannot forbear to strike, and will not suffer that
they should sinne, and carry it with impunity. There are in∣deed
some such parents, that are so indulgent, that, children must
neither have, check, nor stroke from them, what course soever
they take, they scarce hear words, much lesse do they suffer stripes.
These, call this love, but a wiser then they, calls it by the name
of hatred, <HI>Prov. 13. 24. He that spareth the rod, hateth his sonne,
but he that loveth him, chasteneth him betimes.</HI> Pity, will not suf∣fer, to make children smart; But it is greater pity, that the
want of smart, should bring them to the condemnation of hell,
<HI>Prov. 23. 13, 14. With-hold not correction from the childe, for, if
thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die; Thou shalt beat
him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</HI> A childe
in sinne, must either be beaten, or spared; Beating will not be
his death, but sparing tends to his condemnation. The simili∣tude
is not ours, but the Holy Ghosts. One of the most terrible
texts in all the Bible may be found (as one sayes) <HI>Hoses 4. 14.
I will not punish your daughters, when they commit whoredome,
nor your spouses when they commit adultery,</HI> He spares not some,
that he may for ever spare them, chastening them in the world,
that he may not condemn them with the world; He spares some,
and everlastingly destroys them.</P>
<P>2. Otherwise, God would be reconciled to the sinne of his
people, and in league, not only with their persons, but with their
wickednesse, which is most abhorrent to his holinesse. We read
of Gods reconciliation to the world, but never to the wicked∣nesse
of the world; God may be at peace with those that have
sinned, not imputing their trespasses, but he will never be at peace
with sin.</P>
<P>3. It will not stand with his honour to suffer his to go on in
impunity in these ways. Their wickednesse will be said to be by his
allowance. Men in sin, are ready to say (as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> ob∣serve)
<PB N="81" REF="58"/>
that <HI>God is such a one as themselves;</HI> Psalme 50. 21. and
that because they sinne, and he keeps silence. And men of the
world will say the same, if his people go on in sinne, and prosper.
This, the Lord sees and takes care, this way to prevent, <HI>Ezek.
39. 23. And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went
into captivity for their iniquity, because they trespassed against me,
therefore hid I my face from them.</HI> He will make it appear, that he
is no patron to them in that which is evil.</P>
<P>4. God hath given in charge, to Magistrates, his vice-gerents
for to punish. They are <HI>revengers to execute wrath upon them
that do evil,</HI> Rom. 13. 4. they are <HI>sent of God for the punishment of
evil doers,</HI> 1. Pet. 2. 14. They have no commission to spare, upon
supposal of any interest, in God or grace, when they are found
in any acts that are wicked. What they do, God does,
they acting by his command, and by vertue of his commis∣sion.</P>
<P>For further clearing of this point, and, if it may be, to
work a right understanding, I shall lay down severall Posi∣tions.</P>
<P>1. God considered in his absolute Sovereignty, may inflict suf∣ferings,
without injustice on his innocent creatures, there is no
absolute necessity, that sinne should go before all manner of
trouble; Punishment cannot be without a fault; that, alwayes
implies guilt, where justice is followed. Yet, such is Gods Sove∣reignty,
that he may lay affliction where there is no transgression.
We do it upon our fellow-creatures, we tread upon wormes that
never did offend us; God may much more do it upon his creatures,
yea, God does it. How much do bruit creatures suffer in the
world, and unwillingly suffer? as the Apostle speaks, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 20.
and that from Gods hand, that hath made them subject to these
suffering; that, which God doth unto one creature, he may do
unto any creature; that which he doth to the meanest, he may
do to the most noble creature. As a potter may make vessels,
some to honour, and some to dishonour; so God ha∣ving
more transcendent Sovereignty, may make some crea∣tures,
ever blessed; and others during pleasure, to remaine in
misery.</P>
<P>2. It stands not yet with Gods ordinate justice, to strike his
people, where there is no fault. The termes of the covenant
<PB N="82" REF="59"/>
being pre-supposed; none can suffer that have not offended.
every one, upon engagement from God, must be happy, that is
innocent. This is plainly implyed in those words, <HI>In the day that
thou eatest, thou shalt surely die,</HI> sinne not, and suffer not, and
more explicitely held out in those words, <HI>do this, and live,</HI> under
death is comprized all evil, from which man upon covenant is
free, that doth not sinne: Under life is comprised, all blisse,
which, upon covenant, all are to enjoy that yeeld full obedience;
So; that the inlet of suffering, is from sinne, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 12. God ha∣ving,
(as I may say) tyed himself, not out of Sovereignty, to af∣flict,
when man hath not offended.</P>
<P>3. When way is made by sinne, to divine justice, to bring evil
upon man, yet the reason why, this, or that evil, is inflicted, on
this or that man; is not alwayes mans provocation by sinne; All
afflictions are not punishments; nor yet corrections, or chastise∣ments.
There are often other ends and motives. Sometimes,
God looks solely at himselfe, alone at his own glory, in his
strokes; of this we have many instances, <HI>John 9. 1, 2. John</HI> 11. 4.
The same we may say of the viper upon <HI>Pauls</HI> hand, <HI>Acts</HI> 28.
4, 5. Sometimes he looks at his people in the sufferings that he in∣flicts.</P>
<P>1. The patients themselves, laying afflictions upon them, not
as corrections respecting by-past faults, but tryals for discovery
of their graces. That which God laid upon <HI>Job,</HI> was not for his
sinne, but to make it appeare, that Satan had formed a false
charge against him, that his whole service of God, was upon by∣ends,
and base accounts, and that sufferings (God appearing a∣gainst
him in contrary providences) would presently draw him
into all wickednesses. It was a sore affliction to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to
leave his countrey, and his fathers house, to offer up his sonne
<HI>Isaac,</HI> yet these were no corrections, or chastisements, that we
know, but temptations.</P>
<P>2. He looks upon others, that are no sufferers, to bring about
mercy to one, by the sufferings of another; so it was in <HI>Josephs</HI>
sufferings, <HI>Gen.</HI> 50. 20.</P>
<P>4. The corrections that God lays upon the godly, are far differ∣ent
from those that he layes upon the wicked. His hand upon
his own children, differs much from his hand upon his enemies.
God deales otherwise with a Nation, that is a stranger to him,
<PB N="83" REF="59"/>
then he deals with a people that are his own, <HI>Jerem. 30. 11.
Though I make a full end of all Nations whither I have scattered
thee; yet will I not make a full end of thee, but I will correct
thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</HI>
Though both suffer, yet they do not equally, and alike suffer. So, it
is with the Elect, and reprobate, both suffer from the hand of
God; but there is great difference in their sufferings. 1. They
differ in the cause from whence their sufferings respectively do
arise: The sufferings of the wicked, are out of pure wrath,
wicked men, being under a state of wrath. The sufferings of
the people of God, are out of present displeasure, but yet out of
love, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13. 11. Heb. 12. 6, 7. 2. They differ in the end of
their sufferings. A piece of silver is trode upon, with the feet to
scoure and brighten it, but a worme or spider, to crush or spoile
it. 3. They differ in the respective improvement, that either
make of them, the godly are are bettered by their afflictions, their
sufferings are their purges, and purifications, <HI>Psalme</HI> 119. 67.
Their eares are thereby opened for discipline, <HI>Job</HI> 36. 10. the
wicked are more and more hardened by them, and grow more
and more wicked under them, <HI>Esay 1. 5. 2 Chron.</HI> 28. 22.
The Sunne hardens the earth, but softens the butter and the
wax.</P>
<P>The sufferings of the people of God many times proceed
from as high displeasure in God, as can stand with love, and the
more high the sinne is, the greater and sorer is his displeasure:
They work in God as great a dislike as can stand with his purpose,
not utterly to leave and cast them off. When <HI>David</HI> had sinned,
in that high manner as he did, the Text saith, <HI>The thing that Da∣vid
did displeased the Lord,</HI> 2 Sam. 11. <HI>ult.</HI> Few men have had
more of Gods heart then he, yet we see, his heart rises in sore
displeasure, against his wickednesse. We may see how he takes
him up for it, we can scarce see, in all the Scriptures, a man so
chidden. The Prophet reckons up the courtesies and high favours
that he had received from God, <HI>I anointed thee King over Israel,
and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul, and I gave thee thy
Masters house, and thy Masters wives into thy bosome, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve
thee the house of Israel, and of Judah, and if that had been too
little, I would more-over have given thee such and such things.</HI>
And as he had before aggravated his wickednesse, in a parable;
<PB N="84" REF="60"/>
so in expresse termes, he further layes it open. <HI>Wherefore hast
thou despised the Commandment of the Lord; in doing evil in his
sight, thou hast killed Vriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast ta∣ken
his wife to be thy wife.</HI> Then he falls to threatnings, three
great evils (as we may there see) follow upon this evil; yet, all
this while that the Lord thus chides him, that he thus threatens
and beats him, he doth not cease to love him, as appears in <HI>Na∣thans</HI>
words, <HI>verse 13. The Lord hath put away thy sinne;</HI> some
will have love and anger to be inconsistent, hatred and wrath in∣separable;
God is angry, as they say, with none, but those that
he hates, and when anger appears, love is no more; But all know
that this is false among men, a father is many times angry with
his child, that he would be loath to hate; It is as false with God,
he was wrath with <HI>Moses,</HI> but he never hated <HI>Moses,</HI> he owns
his with much love, when he manifests much dislike and distaste
of their present actions.</P>
<P>6. These sufferings of the godly must by no means be account∣ed
satisfactions of divine justice, as coming from vindicative wrath,
nor any part of the curse, that is due from vindicative justice for
sin. Having a tendency not to harme, but to reforme; not to
destroy, but amend; they are only fatherly corrections, and
chastisements, not properly (at least as some rigidly understand
the word) punishments; satisfaction was the work of Christ,
and the whole of the curse was divolved upon him, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 13.
Papists do distinguish between the friendship that is lost by sinne;
and the justice that is deserved. The friendship that is lost, is
made up again, as they confesse, of free grace; but the justice de∣served,
must by the offender be satisfied, which how impossible
it is, for man to do, and how injurious to the sufferings of Christ,
to attempt the doing of it, let us guesse by the definition that
<HI>Bellarmine</HI> gives of it, <HI>Lib. quart. de peniten. cap. 1. Actio, quâ
is, qui alierum laesit, tantum facit, quantum satis est, ad injuriam
compensandam, sive, is qui laesus est, justè exigit.</HI> All that we can
suffer, can never satisfie, the wrong that our sinnes have done
to the divine Majesty, God may justly exact more, then either on
earth, or in their imaginary purgatory; any man can discharge.
As the sufferings of this life, are not worthy of the glory that
shall be revealed; so, neither do they match the evil that justly
might be inflicted. They are all just, but not from Gods reveng∣ing
<PB N="85" REF="60"/>
justice. In themselves they have the nature of curses, but
they are no part of the curse, which upon the breach of the co∣venant
of works, and upon the transgression of the Law, is me∣naced.
As a skilful Physician, makes poison up into a medicine, so
doth God turne curses into blessings; they serve not to kill, but to
cure his people.</P>
<P>7. These sufferings, are not yet barely as some use to speak
from sinne, but chastisements for sinne, not only to prevent sin,
that it may not be committed; but because men have allready
sinned. The <HI>Corinthians</HI> were chastened, not alone, least they
should prophane the Lords Supper; but because they had pro∣phaned
it. God afflicted <HI>David,</HI> not onely lest he should commit
adultery, but because he had committed adultery: He threatens
<HI>Eli,</HI> and punisheth him, not only, lest he should be too indulgent
to his sons; but because he had been too indulgent to them. It
cannot be conceived, how afflictions should prevent sin to come,
if they do not correct sin already past, why are men afraid to sinne
upon account of sufferings, but because upon sin they have suffer∣ed?
Smart for sinne, makes a childe of God watchful against sin.
The childe, that hath seen his fathers frowne is afraid lest
he should frowne againe; that hath beene scourged▪
knows what a father thinks of a fault, and is afraid of a se∣cond.</P>
<P>It is here objected, that it stands not with justice, in this way,
to afflict beleevers, seeing Christ in their stead hath made satis∣faction,
and to punish one sinne twice, is injurious. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1.
These know, that <HI>Socinians</HI> deny, that Christ hath made any satis∣faction,
and if these two cannot stand together, <HI>viz.</HI> Christs sa∣tisfaction,
and beleevers correction, they will soone assume that
beleevers do suffer, (for which the Scripture is very full) and
therefore Christ hath not satisfied, and so their dangerous errour
will be supported. 2. One truth must not be produced to the o∣verthrow
of another, Christ satisfaction, takes us out of the hand
of condemnation, and delivers from revengeful wrath, but not out
of the hand of discipline; when God becomes a Saviour, he doth
not cease to be a Sovereign; a father, that is a Judge, may lash his
childe, that he never intends to sentence. If any will see further
Objections raised and answered, let him consult Mr. <HI>Burges</HI> of
justification. <HI>Part. 1. Lecture 5. pag.</HI> 33.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Agreement between the Covenant of works and the Cove∣nant
of grace.</HEAD>
<P>HAving asserted a covenant of grace, and premised such
things that may contribute some light, towards a right
understanding of it, I must proceed to enquire into the respective
agreement, and differences between these covenants. The for∣mer
is an easie work, there being no controversie or dispute raised
about it, and therefore I shall briefly passe it over. They a∣gree,
1. In the general nature of a covenant, both are cove∣nants
strictly so called, as hath already been demonstrated. 2. They
have one and the same authour, that is God. He proposed the
termes of the covenant, to <HI>Adam,</HI> for himself, and all of his poste∣rity,
and he enters covenant with the posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> in their
fallen condition. 3. The parties in covenant, are in both of
them, God and man, God propounding, man accepting, though
there be (as we have heard) that would have it otherwise. 4. In
either of both, there is a tendency to mans happinesse, Life is gi∣ven
in promise in both, as we see <HI>Rom. 10▪</HI> 5, 6, &amp;c. where both
covenants are distinctly considered, what difference or agreement
there may be in the life promised, will after be spoke unto. 5. In
both of them there is a restipulation from man as there is an en∣gagement
from God; as, God engageth himself for reward, so
man is engaged to duty; the former was never doubted, the la∣ter
hath been largely proved. 6. In either of both, righteous∣ness
is called for from those that enter covenant. For the first
it is not questioned, in that it is a covenant of Works. Failing in
doing was death. Interest in perfect righteousnesse is required
in the latter, which is called, the righteousnesse of faith, and is
the righteousnesse of the Law, performed, not by our selves, but by
another, <HI>Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnesse to every one
that beleeveth,</HI> Rom. 10. 4. Sincerity, in inherent righteousnesse
is required likewise, both of these will be morefully demonstrated.
7. Either of both are indispensable, the conditions being not
<PB N="87" REF="61"/>
performed, the penalty of the covenant in both is inflicted, <HI>Adams</HI>
posterity had experience of the one, and all unbeleevers, and im∣penitent
ones, will bear the other; not believing, not repenting
brings death, as sometimes not perfectly obeying. That di∣stinction,
of the covenant of grace, calling for one thing, and
accepting of another, afterwards will be considered. 8. Neither
of both covenants are personal, as entered with any single person,
or persons, and determined in him or them, but both of them,
include posterity. In the covenant of works, it is not so expres∣sly
delivered, but not to be doubted. That covenant was en∣tred
with <HI>Adam,</HI> for all his, the latter is more expresse, to the
covenanters and their seed, both in Old and New Testament-Scrip∣tures,
which by a party is questioned, but remaines largely to
be confirmed.</P>

<DIV1 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Differences between the Covenants of Works and the Cove∣nant
of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>HAving spoken to the agreement between these two Cove∣nants,
I must now more largely enquire into the differences,
which will prove a work of greater difficulty, there being so much
opposition. The first and leading difference is, that being both
of them between God and man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Works was entred into in mans state of integrity.</NOTE> they were entred into in a different
estate and condition of man. The first was entered <HI>in statu insti∣tuto,</HI>
in mans integrity, when man had not at all, by sinne incur∣red
the displeasure of God, or weakened his abilities for obedience;
Man then stood as he came out of Gods hand, bearing in himselfe
a lively resemblance of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Grace was entered into in mans fallen condition.</NOTE> The second was <HI>in statu destituto,</HI>
in mans fallen estate, now in sinne, under wrath, dead in sinne, and
wholly disabled from yeelding obedience, of this there is no con∣troversie,
and therefore I need not make more words about it.
And from hence all other differences which I shall observe; or
which (as I suppose) are observable, have their rise, which are these
following.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="62"/>
The covenant of Works,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Works was to mans preser∣vation.</NOTE> or (as learned <HI>Camero</HI> calls it) the
covenant of Nature, was for preservation of man in life, that is,
in present blisse and happinesse, to hold him in the condition in
which it found him, which is implyed in the penalty threatned, as
was before noted; man must not die till sinne enter, and exprest in
that promise of God, <HI>Do this and live;</HI> His life must be continued
as long as his obedience lasted, his happinesse must have been per∣petuated,
(though not necessarily in the same degree, God might
have translated him from a life on earth to a life in heaven) had he
kept to the terms of the covenant. The covenant of grace is for
mans restitution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Grace was to mans resti∣tution.</NOTE> reconciliation and recovery; He was before in
blisse, and if he had so abode, he might with good reason have ta∣ken
up <HI>Peters</HI> words, <HI>It is good for us to be here.</HI> Now he is in mise∣ry,
and must be restored, if ever he be blessed, and so a farther differ∣ence
doth arise.</P>
<P>The covenant of works had its precedency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Works was first in time. The Covenant of Grace in or∣der of time followed after.</NOTE> was first in time;
The covenant of grace in order of time follows after; This
must needs follow, Mans estate in integrity being before his fall,
the covenant made in his integrity, must needs precede the cove∣nant
entred into in his fallen condition, unlesse we will place the
third of <HI>Genesis</HI> before the first, the fall of man before his creation;
And therefore that is utterly a mistake in one, who in the very
entrance upon his Treatise of the two covenants, gives the
covenant of grace the precedency in time, giving this as his rea∣son,
why he places the covenant of Grace before the covenant of
Works, <HI>because the covenant of Grace was in being before the co∣venant
of Works,</HI> quoting for proof, <HI>Gal. 3. 17. The covenant
which was made before of God in Christ, the Law which was four hun∣dred
and thirty years after cannot disanul.</HI> But this can by no means
serve his purpose, unlesse we should conclude that the covenant of
Works had its beginning in Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> at the giving of the Law
by <HI>Moses,</HI> and the covenant of Grace, of only four hundred and
thirty yeares more ancient standing. And that, will as little serve
his purpose which he after brings in, that there was an <HI>agreement
and covenant between God the Father, and his Sonne Jesus Christ
about the salvation of man before</HI> Adam <HI>sinned, yea, before the
world began;</HI> Seeing that covenant between the first and second
person of the Trinity, was not the covenant, which he hath in
hand to treat upon, namely the <HI>covenant which God entred with
<PB N="89" REF="62"/>
man,</HI> as he himself confesses; No covenant can be made with man
before man be in being, <HI>A no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens</HI> can be no party in a covenant.
And whereas we are told that <HI>the same covenant which was made
with Jesus Christ before time, was afterwards made with man.</HI>
I desire that all would observe what is laid down in that Trea∣tise
concerning that covenant. <HI>Christ for his part was by cove∣nant
to become a Mediatour, Surety, and Saviour; for all those
that his Father should give him.</HI> And must we become such
Mediatours Sureties and Saviours also? God the Father did pro∣mise
to Christ, as is further said, <HI>all the things that did belong to
his Mediatourship, and things to gratifie and satisfie him for his
Mediatourship.</HI> May we by covenant expect such things from
the Father likewise? If we are neither tied to the same work,
to which Christ by covenant was tied, nor are to receive the like
gifts, as he by covenant was to expect, we are not in the same co∣venant
that past between the Father and Christ. And though
these two were one, which must not be yeelded, (the covenants
<HI>ad intra,</HI> which the persons of the Trinity make with themse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,
and those <HI>ad extra</HI> with the creature may not be confounded)
yet that would evince no such precedence in time, seeing there
was alike agreement in the whole Trinity for the creation of
man, and Gods covenant with him in his integrity, as is fully
assented to in the same Treatise, to the utter overthrow of all
that which upon the former supposition he had built. To
that question, <HI>To what end should the covenant of Grace be
made before man stood in need of Grace?</HI> he answers, <HI>Known
unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world;</HI>
And he had all things then as present and real before the
eyes of his glory, as now he hath, <HI>viz.</HI> Mans Creation,
Fall, Recovery, and in this sense there was no precedency of time
in regard of any of Gods Counsels or secret actions. And then
there can be no precedency of one of his covenants before an∣other,
we must finde then a sense according to which there is
a precedency, which is not found in any covenants of the Tri∣nity
among themselves (which in exact propriety of speech
are purposes rather then covenants, and were before all time)
but in the actual entrance and assent by the creature given,
which is in time, and admits precedency; In which considera∣tion
the covenant of works hath its precedency before that of
<PB N="90" REF="63"/>
Grace, as the state of integrity was before the fall.</P>
<P>Whence farther yet follows that the covenant of works,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Works was a small time in force.</NOTE>
was but a small time in force, at least but a small time of
use, only during the space of mans integrity, which some say
was only one day, in all probability not long, in that man en∣joyed
no fruit of that blessing in Paradise, <HI>Increase and multi∣ply.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Grace is of everlasting continuance.</NOTE>
But this second, is, of everlasting continuance, when the first
Covenant was violated by our first parents, and so made uselesse,
that of grace succeeded, which is our only planck after ship∣wrack,
but none shall ever succeed this second. <HI>Adam</HI> failing of
salvation by the covenant of Works (which he entred in the first
place) is saved by the covenant of grace, into which after his
fall he entred, and into which he was of grace admitted; but he
that is not saved by the second, must everlastingly perish, and so
I understand that text, <HI>Heb. 10. 26. If we sinne wilfully after we
have received the knowledge of the truth, then there remaineth no
more sacrifice for sinnes, but a fearful looking for of judgement
and fiery indignation;</HI> where, by sinning wilfully, I understand an
utter rejection of Gods tender of this sacrifice of Christs blood,
which I gather from the Apostle in the words that follow, the
proof that he brings of that sad assertion, <HI>He that despised</HI> Mo∣ses
<HI>Law, died without mercy under two or three witnesses, of how
much sorer punishment shall he be thought worthy that hath
trodden under foot the blood of the Sonne of God, and counted
the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
thing?</HI> This is that wilful sinne of which there is no expiation.
When man had cast off the yoke, a sacrifice was found, Christ
made his soul an offering for sinne; but when Christ is rejected,
there is no other sacrifice to be looked for. In the covenant of
grace God hath made known his whole minde concerning mans
salvation, by what means, and upon what termes man shall be
saved.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A further difference between the Covenant of Works and
the Covenant of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>ANother difference of great importance between these co∣venants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Works had no Mediatour.</NOTE>
and which necessarily (as the two former) flows
from the first, is, That the first covenant between God and man
was immediate, no Mediatour intervening, no dayes-man stand∣ing
between them, to make them one; But for the second, man
being fallen by sinne, a Mediatour was necessary that God and man
now in that distance, should be reconciled. I know some have
contended, that not only man in integrity, but the Angels them∣selves,
stood in need of Christs mediation, producing their grounds
for their assertion, and then this difference between these cove∣nants,
falls, neither of both are immediate, both standing in need
of a Mediatour. The grounds are,</P>
<P>First,<MILESTONE UNIT="Obj."/> <HI>That the obedience of man and Angels was imperfect, and
stood in need of pardon, and for the righteousnesse of Christ which
he performed to the Father, was accounted perfect,</HI> quoting that
place of <HI>Eliphaz</HI> in his speech to <HI>Job, Job 4. 18. Even his An∣gels
he charged with folly.</HI> If Angels stood thus in Gods eye,
under such a charge, then much more man, as <HI>Eliphas</HI> there ar∣gues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE>
But I would demand of these, concerning this supposed im∣perfection
in man and Angels, thus supplied by Christs perfecti∣on,
whether it were properly, and of its own nature a sinne? If
not, then there is no place for pardon; If it were, then it must
be divolved on Christ, and laid upon him to expiate, and so man
fell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cujus enim par∣ticipatione justi sunt, ejus com∣paratione nec justi sunt. <HI>Aug. ad Orosium contra Priscil. cap.</HI> 10</NOTE> (or at least lay down groveling) before his fall; and the good
Angels by reason of sin, are evil as well as those that are fallen; but
these are absurd. In that of <HI>Eliphaz</HI> therefore (if it must be under∣stood
of Angels of glory) sin, is not charged or implied, but only
defect, standing in comparison or competition with God, an im∣perfection
negative is yeelded, they match not God in perfecti∣on,
but in his presence cover their faces with their wings, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6. 2.
but no imperfection privative, they want no perfection of which
they are in any capacity, and whereof they have any necessity;
<PB N="92" REF="64"/>
God made no creature in such a necessity of sinning, or in such a
being that needed pardon.</P>
<P>A second ground is,<MILESTONE UNIT="Obj."/> <HI>That though a Mediator was not necessary by
way of reconciliation, yet he was necessary by way of preservation in
righteousnesse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> The second fully overthrows the first, in that which
it grants, and I know not how that can be proved that it affirms,
Man was not preserved, and therefore it appears, that he had no
such Mediatour appointed for his preservation. And it seems (ac∣cording
to this opinion) man could not have stood, unlesse Christ
had been incarnate, and so his fall was not, from the freedome of
his will, but the principles of his creation, For the Angels, how
they can be said, to stand by grace received from Christ, a Me∣diatour;
I know not, they being no fellow-members with us,
though fellow-servants; And howsoever accidental benefits come
to the Angels, by Christ, in their joy to see lost man restored, and
reconciled; as to God, so also to their fellowship and communion;
(according to that of the Apostle, <HI>Ephes. 1. 10. Col.</HI> 1. 20. in their
experimental knowledge also, of the wisdome of God in this
great mystery, 1 <HI>Pet. 1. 12. Ephes.</HI> 3. 10.) yet, I doubt not that it
was for man, whose nature he assumed, that Christ was incarnate,
and that he is a Mediatour between God and man, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5.
and not between God and Angels, and that for fallen man, and
not for man in his integrity; Therefore I conclude the first cove∣nant
was immediate; no Mediatour intervening, all the bles∣sings
of the first covenant flowed from the whole Trinity, as
the Creation it self, without respect to Christ incarnate, there
was no revelation of that high mystery to man in innocency, In
which the Reader may consult <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>marus</HI> in <HI>Colos. 1▪</HI> 20.</P>

<HI>Two cannot walk together unlesse they be agreed,</HI> Amos 3. 3. That

Christ undertakes and effects, and so is the Meditatour in this
work.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Works incumbent upon the Mediatour of the Cove∣nant
of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>THis work of Christ in his Mediatourship, I suppose may fitly
be reduced to these heads.</P>
<P>First, to bring man into a capacity of covenanting with
God.</P>
<P>Secondly, to bring man into the bond of the covenant; profes∣sedly
to accept it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, to enable those whom he brings to glory; to perform
the duties of the covenant, to be steady and upright in it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, to crown those with glory; whom by grace be brings
up to the terms of the covenant.</P>
<P>1. He is to bring man into a capacity of covenanting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ brings man into a ca∣pacity of cove∣nanting with God.</NOTE> of which
sinne had made mankinde uncapable, for though it should be
granted, that God in absolute justice, is not bound to punish sinne
wheresoever he findes it; and that it is not against his Essence (as
some would have it) to pardon sin without satisfaction, yet his or∣dinate
justice is thus bound, That law of his, being presupposed,
<HI>The day that thou eatest, thou shalt surely die,</HI> he cannot recede
from it; the penalty of this Law must be born; in order to recon∣ciliation,
and justice satisfied for mans transgression, which must
be done by such a one, that can answer the claime of divine justice.
The beasts of the Forrests, and cattel of a thousand hills (which
were yet often given to God in sacrifice) could not do it. The A∣postle
tells us, that <HI>it is impossible that the blood of Bulls and Goats
should take away sinne,</HI> Heb. 10. 4. They were never guilty, and
they are no valuable consideration, nor yet the Angels who are
above mankinde, as the bruit creatures are below. Man had sin∣ned,
and a sacrifice from among man-kinde, is to be found, Neither
can man in sin, and under the taint of it be accepted, all that he can
<PB N="94" REF="65"/>
suffer is due for himself, and therefore can be no other mans dis∣charge.
In the payment of my own debt, I set free no other debtor;
Neither can any, that is meer man go thorow with it, here is pure
justice without relaxation, as to the value, confest by those who yet
contend whether <HI>idem</HI> or <HI>tantundem</HI> be paid by Christ, the same
in kinde, as was owing by man, or the like in value and estimate;
He that is brought under a divine attachment, must not come out
till he have paid the uttermost farthing, which man in torments is
ever in discharging, and never can discharge; It is as easie to make
a world, as by way of ransome to deliver a soul. Christ <HI>there∣fore
that knew no sin, is made sinne, that is, an offering for sinne. God
manifest in the flesh,</HI> he that was God and man, hath undertaken
the work, man to suffer, and God to satisfie in suffering, and so
<HI>God is in Christ reconciling the world to himself, 2 Corinth.</HI> 5. 19.
The immediate effect or result of this price of mans redempti∣on,
(I suppose) is the putting of man into a capacity of a cove∣nant
with God, yet when this is done, till more be done, by Christ
in the way of his Mediatourship for man, men are not yet in cove∣nant,
not the Elect among men. This is evident in those Ephe∣sians,
<HI>that were raised up together, and made sit together in heaven∣ly
places in Christ Jesus,</HI> Ephes. 2. 6. There was no time in which
Christ had not paid the price of their ransome, yet there was a
time, and then but lately over, that they were <HI>without Christ, be∣ing
aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, and strangers from
the covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God in the
world,</HI> Ephes. 2. 12. Elect Infidels are not till their call, in cove∣nant,
they stand not actually reconciled, and one with God be∣fore
Faith, for then there needed no Ministery of reconciliation
to follow. If this were granted, then Christ did the whole for
mans salvation on the crosse by himself, and doth nothing now
in heaven, by way of intercession, nor any thing by his agents
in a ministerial way upon earth, neither could man before faith, be
underwrath, in which he is yet concluded by our Saviour himself,
<HI>John</HI> 3. 36. A state of wrath, and an actual reconciled estate can∣not
stand together. There is a price paid, and (as I may say) in the
Fathers hand, but to be applyed according to the good pleasure
of the Father and the Sonne; A man may purchase a prisoners
liberty; so that he hath it in his just and legal power to set him
free; and yet take what time he pleaseth in discretion to impart it
<PB N="95" REF="65"/>
to him, and actually deliver him. In this work there are three
parties; God the Father, as Creditor, Christ Jesus, the Surety Man,
the Debtor. The Father might have refused this discharge from
the hand of Christ, and exacted it of the principal; Christ
might have refused to have made such payment, he was not in
the Obligation; There was a relaxation of the person, as is a∣greed
on all parties; Man must come in and manifest his accept∣ance,
Till he is content to leave his old master, sin and Satan;
This new Lord gives him no entertainment, he must be con∣tent
to come out of bondage, or else he can enjoy no free∣dome.</P>
<P>2. The next work of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ brings man within the verge of the Covenant. 1. By his tender of it.</NOTE> is to bring man within the bond
of the covenant professedly to accept it, for which there is yet a
double work. First, to make tender of it, this hath been Christs
work as the Prophet of his Church in all ages. In what latitude
in was carried in the dayes of the fathers before the flood, it is ra∣ther
obscurely pointed at; then plainly shewed; yet there was
then a distinction, between the posterity of <HI>Seth,</HI> and that of
<HI>Cain,</HI> and so contiued till the dayes of <HI>Noah,</HI> when <HI>the sonnes of
God saw the daughters of men;</HI> children of the covenant, saw
those out of the covenant; Men within the visible Church, saw
women without the Pale, and joyned themselves in marriage with
them. From <HI>Abrahams</HI> dayes it was confined to his posterity,
and held within his line, and those few that as proselytes joyned
themselves unto them. In Gospel times it is enlarged, the tender
is made not to Jewes only, but also to every Nation under hea∣ven,
the Commission being to preach the Gospel to every crea∣ture,
none by Nation so contemptible, that is to be excluded. <HI>In
Christ Jesus there is neither Barbarian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. By shaping the heart for it.</NOTE> <HI>nor Scythian, Jew or Gentile,
Col.</HI> 3. 11. And, as there is to be a tender; so also it is his work
to shape the heart for acceptation of it, to embrace the terms,
and enter into it. <HI>God shall perswade▪</HI> Japhet, <HI>and he shall dwell in
the tents of</HI> Shem, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. 27. The inhabitants of the Isles peo∣pled
by <HI>Japhets</HI> posterity shall become the <HI>Israel</HI> of God, shall
succeed the Jewes in a Church-state, and vissible profession of the
name of God, <HI>The hand of the Lord was with them,</HI> namely,
those that preacht at <HI>Antioch, and a great number beleeved,</HI> Acts
11. 21. where beleeving (after the manner of the History in the
<HI>Acts</HI>) is no other then embracing the Doctrine of Faith, they
<PB N="96" REF="66"/>
were made Disciples; many of which after fell off, even from their
profession.</P>
<P>A third work is to enable those whom he brings to glory (those
among them in covenant that are called according to his purpose)
to performe the duties of the covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ brings up to the terms of the Cove∣nant.</NOTE> to be stedfast and upright
in it, and this is by <HI>Circumcising their heart giving them a new heart,
writing his Law in their hearts, putting it into their inward parts,
keeping them by his mighty power through faith unto salvation;</HI> of
which more hereafter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ crowns those that come up to the terms of the covenant</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>The last work is to crown with glory those that by grace he
raises up, to the termes of the covenant, thus qualifying them,
he crowns them,</HI> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousnesse,
which the Lord, the righteous Judge shall give me at that day,
2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 7, 8. I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare
a place for you, I will come again and receive you to my self, <HI>John</HI>
14. 2, 3.</P>
<P>Here some difficulties offer themselves, If the covenant of
works (past between God and man in his integrity) were imme∣diate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulties removed.</NOTE>
and the transactions of it without reference to Christ, then
if follows that faith in Christ is not commanded in that Law,<MILESTONE UNIT="Obj."/>
which was given to man for a rule, There being no possibility of
it, there could be no command for it, and there was no possibi∣lity
of <HI>Adams</HI> beleeving it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith is a duty of the moral Law.</NOTE> seeing Christ was not revealed, and
was not as Mediatour of any use. This opinion is strongly main∣tained
by Arminians. <HI>Armin. in resp. ad artic. decimum nonum.
Corvinus Contr. Molin. cap.</HI> 11. And to this end, that they may
make it good, that God cannot in justice require faith in Christ,
from man in his fallen condition, unlesse he withal confer upon
him abilities to believe, seeing he never had that power from him
in his integrity, and state of purity, and upon this supposition
the argument seems of force. We vindicate Gods justice in com∣manding
works; though to us now impossible, seeing once we
had power to reach the highest of his precepts, and his command,
is no rule of our empaired strength, but of our duty. But if men
never had that power, and the Law never required it, it is inju∣stice
(according to all parties) to exact it.<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> Let those that fall
to the Arminians in this tenent, (that they may make the Law
an imperfect rule, and an insufficient direction) see how they can
<PB N="97" REF="66"/>
avoid it, how they can vindicate Gods justice thus impeached.
But the Orthodox party have still maintained that <HI>Adam</HI> had, in
his integrity that faith that doth justifie, though then it per∣formed
not that office of justification, as he had that faculty
whereby we see dead bodies; though then there was no possibi∣lity
of such sight, there being no dead bodies to be seen. And
that faith in Christ is commanded in the first precept of the Law
is manifest. There we are commanded to have God for our
God, no Interpreter will deny, that the affirmative is contained
in that negative: <HI>Thou shalt have none other gods but me.</HI> Now
God is the God of beleevers, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 16. No man can have any
communion with God, but by faith in Christ. And so conse∣quently
this faith is there required; what Expositor of the Law
doth not put trust and affiance in God, within the affirmative part
of the first commandment, as well as fear, love, and obedience?
And without Christ there can be no affiance or trust. If we con∣ceive
the moral Law, to reach no farther then the duties expresse∣ly
there named, or the evils forbidden, we shall make it very
scant and narrow, we shall see small reason, of that of the Psal∣mist,
<HI>Thy Commandment is exceeding broad,</HI> Psalme 119. 96.
But in case we take in all that by necessary consequence may be
inferred, according to the approved rules of interpretation, then
scarce any duty is more clearly laid down then this of faith in
Christ. And whereas one faith, <HI>A man cannot preach Faith in
Christ out of the Moral Law,</HI> I say, a man out of the Moral
Law, may evince the necessity of Faith in Christ; unto every
one that lives in Gospel-light, to whom Christ is tendred; The
Law requires the duty, and the Gospel discovers the object, no man
out of the Law could have evinced <HI>Abraham</HI> that he must offer
his sonne, nor that he must have left his countrey, but when
Gods minde was made known to him, the Moral Law did binde
him to obedience, and he had sinned against the Moral Law, in
case he had refused. There is no command given of God to any
man, at any time, of an nature whatsoever, but the Moral Law
ties him to the observation of it, not immediately, explicitely,
but upon supposition of such a command intervening. <HI>Therefore
ye shall observe all my Statutes, and all my judgements, and do
them, I am the Lord,</HI> Levit. 19. 37. Faith in Christ being com∣manded
of God, <HI>I John</HI> 3. 23. the Moral Law obliges to o∣bedience
<PB N="98" REF="67"/>
of it. See <HI>Molin. Anatom. Arminianis. cap. 11. Respons.
Wallaei. ad Censuram Johannis Arnol. Corvini cap. 11. Ball</HI> on the
covenant, <HI>page</HI> 105. Burges <HI>Vindiciae legis. page</HI> 117.</P>
<P>A farther difficulty here offers it selfe,<MILESTONE UNIT="Obj."/> and an obstruction
laid against that which in this Treatise is after intended. If
the covenant, or second covenant (as opposite to that of
works) be in Christ, and grounded on the work of reconciliation,
then it is commensurate with it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of grace not commensurate with election.</NOTE> and of no greater latitude, and
only the elect and chosen in Christ, the called according to Gods
purpose, being reconciled, only these are in covenant; when the
Scripture (as shall be, God willing, made good) confines
not this covenant within the limits of the invisible Church,
known only to God. But it is as large as the Church vi∣sible.</P>
<P>To this I answer,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> that the Prophetical office of Christ, as Shep∣herd
and Bishop of our souls, and so much of his Kingly office
as consists in a legislative power, hath its foundation (as well as
the covenant) in this work of reconciliation. Had not this been
undertaken by Christ for mankinde, man had never enjoyed
that light, man had never had an Oracle, or an Ordinance as the
fruit of his Prophetick office, yet, these Ordinances are not com∣mensurate
with reconciliation, nor of equal latitude with ele∣ction,
So neither is the covenant, but either of both in order
towards it. As Ordinances therefore are Christs gift from heaven,
as the fruit of his death and resurrection, when yet all that par∣take
of these Ordinances do not yet die or rise with Christ; So, is
the covenant, when yet all in covenant are not stedfast in it, nor
obtaine the graces of it. Therefore I know not how to admit that
which a Divine singularly eminent hath laid down; <HI>That all the
effects of Christs death are spiritual, distinguishing and saving;</HI>
Seeing gifts of Christ; from his Fathers right hand are fruits of
his death, yet not spiritual, distinguishing and saving. That they
are in some sort spiritual, I dare grant that is, <HI>in ordine ad spiritua∣lia,</HI>
(if I may so speak) they have a tendency to a spiritual work.
That they are distinguishing from the world, (as it is taken in op∣position
to the Church visible) I yeeld, for I do not enlarge the
fruit of Christs death to all man-kinde, assenting to Master <HI>Owen</HI>
and Master <HI>Stalham</HI> in the grounds that they lay, of Gods respite
of the execution of the whole penalty on man, with the continu∣ance
<PB N="99" REF="67"/>
of outward favours not to be upon the account of Christ, but
for other reasons; yet I know not how to affirme, that Ordinan∣ces
which yet are fruits of his death, are all saving, spiritual and
distinguishing, seeing they neither conferre salvation nor saving
grace on all that partake of them, So that Christ, is a Mediatour
of this covenant; and yet those enter into it that have not
reconciliation by Christ Jesus; The Ephesians that <HI>were afar off,
are made nigh by the blood of Christ,</HI> Ephes. 2. 13. that is,
brought into a visible Church-state in the fruition of Ordinan∣ces,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Farther differences between the Covenant of Works and the

<P>A Farther difference of importance, between these covenants,
is, in the conditions annext unto either of them, and here
the difference is brought to the height. This alone so diversi∣fies
them; that they are not barely, in circumstance and way of
administration; but in substance two distinct covenants; The
least difference in conditions, diversifies bargains and agreements
on what part soever the difference is.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conditions in the Covenant of works and the covenant of grace of Gods part seem to be the same.</NOTE> Conditions of the cove∣nant

in case of covenant-keeping, or, punishments in case of
covenant-breaking; The one the Lord promises, The other he
threatens. I finde no material difference in the conditions on
Gods part in these covenants. Life is promised in both, in case of
covenant-keeping; and death is threatned in both, in case of
covenant-breaking. Some indeed have endeavoured to finde
a great difference in the life promised in the covenant of

been promised?</HI> From which two, endlessely more, by way of con∣sectary
may be drawn; by those that want neither wit, nor lei∣sure
to debate them. In which the best way of satisfaction and
avoidance of such puzling mazes; is to enquire what Scripture
means by <HI>Life,</HI> which is the good in the covenant promised; and
what by <HI>Death,</HI> which is the evil threatned? Now for the first,
<HI>Life</HI> containes all whatsoever, that conduces to true happinesse, to
make man blessed in soul and body. All good that Christ pur∣chases,
and heaven enjoys, is comprised under it, in Gospel-ex∣pressions.
<HI>I am come that they might have life, and that they
may have it more abundantly,</HI> John 10. 10. <HI>He that hath the Son,
hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne, hath not life,</HI> 1 John 5.
12. On the contrary, under <HI>Death</HI> is comprised, all that is in∣jurious
to man or mankinde, that tends to his misery in soul and
body. The damnation of Hell being called death, the uttermost
of evils being the separation of soul and body from God, <HI>John
8. 51. 1 John</HI> 3. 14. Sinne which leads to it, and is the cause of
it, is called death in like manner; <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 1. And the separation
of soul from the body, being called death, sicknesses, plagues, are
so called in like manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Life promised in the Cove∣nant of Works and the Cove∣nant of Grace is one and the same.</NOTE> <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> 10. 17. Now happinesse being
promised to man in covenant, only indefinitely under that noti∣on
of life, without limit to this or that way of happinesse, in
this or that place, God is still at liberty, so that he make man
happy, where, or how he pleaseth to continue happinesse to him,
and is not tied up in his engagement either for earth or heaven.
And therefore though learned <HI>Camero</HI> in his Treatise <HI>de triplici foe∣dere,</HI>
Thes. 9. with others, makes this difference between the cove∣nant
of works and the covenant of grace. <HI>In the covenant of Works,</HI>
(which he calls nature) <HI>life was promised, and a most blessed life, but
an animal life in Paradise, in the covenant of Grace a life in
Heaven and spiritual.</HI> And Master <HI>Baxter</HI> in his <HI>Aphoris.</HI> of
Justification, <HI>page</HI> 5. saith, <HI>that this life premised was only the
continuance of that state that</HI> Adam <HI>was then in, Paradise, is the
opinion of most Divines.</HI> Yet with submission to better judge∣ments
I see not grounds for it; seeing Scripture no way deter∣mines
<PB N="101" REF="68"/>
the way and kinde of this happinesse promised, and in
case that we take liberty to say, that when long life is promised
upon earth (in many texts of Scripture) that the promise is made
good though it faile on earth, in case it be supplied in heaven,
life being the marrow of the promise, much more then is it
made good, when it is indefinitely promised, without limit to a
man whil'st on earth, in case it be made good by his translati∣on
into heaven. And indeed there are strong probabilities, hea∣ven
being set out by the name of Paradise in Christs speech to the
thief on the crosse; and in <HI>Pauls</HI> vision in that rapture, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI>
12. if we may make such a supposition of mans standing, now
he is fallen, that he should not have continued a life of immor∣tality
on earth, but have been translated into heaven. He had
that blessing from God as other living creatures, <HI>to be fruitfull
and multiply,</HI> Gen. 1. 28. and how the world could have con∣tained
all those individuals at once; which to eternity man
should propagate, cannot be imagined. And to conceive, that
an end in time should be put to propagation; when an animal
life in the use of the creature should be continued, is scarce consist∣ent
with reason. But a thousand of these God can expedite
when we are at a stand; He promised life, and he could have
made it good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death threat∣ned in the Co∣venent of Works and in the Covenant of Grace is one and the same.</NOTE> and we see he limited not himself, where, or how
to conferre it. And what I have said of life promised, the same
I say of death threatned, in case man upon sinne be brought into
a state of misery, Justice is done, and the threat takes hold, where,
and howsoever this misery be suffered, whether it had been in
sorrows, and horrours on earth, in separation of the soul first, for
torments and the body to follow, or in a speedy dispatch of soul
and body to hell. Gods way of execution after the sinne com∣mitted,
(on those that are not by Christ ransomed) does not ar∣gue
that the penalty in the covenant necessitated him to it,
might not he at once have poured out the whole of his venge∣ance
on vessels of wrath, when yet we know, that he takes time
for the execution of it? A Learned Writer enquiring into this
death that was here threatned, saith, that <HI>the same damnation
that followed the breach of the second covenant, it could not be;</HI> When
I suppose it rather should be said, that in substance and kind, it can
be no other; Infidels that were never under any other covenant
then that of works; and covenant-breaking Christians are in the
<PB N="102" REF="69"/>
same condemnation, there is not two hells but one and the same,
<HI>for those that know not God, and those that obey not the Gospel
of Christ,</HI> 2 Thes. 1. 8. Neither is there any <HI>Limbus,</HI> or distinct
place for infants in original sinne, and out of the covenant of
grace. Neither can I assent to that speech, <HI>To say that</HI> Adam
<HI>should have gone quick to hell, if Christ had not been promised,
or sinne pardoned, is to contradict the Scriptures, that makes death
temporal the wages of sinne.</HI> It were I confesse to presume above
Scripture, but I cannot see it a contradiction of Scripture; A
burning Feaver, a Consumption, Leprosie, Pestilence, &amp;c. are in
Scripture made the wages of sinne, yet many go to hell and misse
those diseases. And if it be said Scripture so makes death the wages
of sin, that all must suffer it, I answer, Those Scriptures are all of
them <HI>leges post latae,</HI> appointed of God, as his way upon mans
fall, neither absolute justice, nor yet the penalty threatned ne∣cessitating
him to that way of proceeding. He takes the same
way where his justice hath already satisfaction, Those that are
priviledged from death as the wages of sinne, thus die; God tied
not up his own hands, as States do their Judges, and ministerial
officers, to one way of execution; and this his way with the unbe∣leeving
is voluntary, and not necessitated, Upon these grounds
it is, that I finde no reason to widen the differences between these
promises and priviledges in either covenants.</P>
<P>The identity of conditions, in the covenant of Works and
Grace, on Gods part we have seen; The great diversity
in the conditions called for from man comes to be spo∣ken
to.</P>
<P><HI>And in the first place this difference offers it self.</HI> The conditions
of the covenant of Works were in mans power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conditi∣ons in the Co∣venāt of works were in mans power.</NOTE> being left to the freedom
of his will; he had abilities in himself without seeking out for further
assistance then a meer general concurrence to perform them. <HI>This abili∣ty
in man to answer whatsoever was called for at his hands from
God, appears</HI></P>
<P>First, in the integrity of his nature; Being made like God, his
principles must needs carry him to a conformity with God, and
these principles were connatural to man, in his first being and
beginning. Man being made of God to contemplate his glo∣ry,
and to enjoy communion with himself, he made him not de∣fective
in any of those noble qualifications that serve for it, or
<PB N="103" REF="69"/>
have a tendency to it. Papists indeed will have this to be a su∣pernaturall
gift of grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quā veluti au∣reo quodam frae∣no pars inferior parti superiori, &amp; pars superior Deo facile sub∣jecta continere∣tur. <HI>Bellar.</HI> De. Grat. primi ho∣minis, <HI>cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> and above the glory of mans first creati∣on.
<HI>Bellarmine</HI> compares it to a <HI>bridle given to curb that lust
which riseth against reason in us.</HI> That rebellion of lusts in man,
they conceit, would have been, if man had not fallen; which, as
it layes a high charge upon God; in such an aspersion of his pure
work drawn after such a patterne; so, it makes way for other
opinions, that the first motions without consent are no sins, and
that lust in the regenerate, is not sin. But as the bottom is rotten,
so, also the building that is raised upon it is ruinous. There was
an happy agreement in man, as well with himself, as with his Cre∣atour:
The fall brought in a necessity of support and supply of
Grace.</P>
<P>Secondly, this appears from the equity which must be granted to
be in the command of God; which requires that the work given in
charge be not above his abilities, that is charged with it. The
<HI>Arminian</HI> argument from a command, to abilities to keep the com∣mand,
from a threat to conclude a power to keep off from the
thing threatned, is of force, as long as the person under command
keeps himself in the same station, and strength, as when the com∣mand
was given. But applying this to man in his fallen estate
(who had sinned away his abilities,) the strength of it is wholly
lost. The command of God retains its perfection; when we are
under the power of corruption. The Law is nothing abated, though
we be weakened.</P>
<P>3. It appears in the work it self which was charged upon man
upon performance of which he was to expect happinesse. There
is no more explicitely mentioned, then that negative precert: <HI>Of
the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat; the day that
thou eatest, thou shalt surely die.</HI> This, all may yeeld might easily
have been kept if the command had been heeded, or the menace
observed. The Jews at their worst could observe the commands of
<HI>non-licet</HI> meats, and this was a command of like nature, yet this
was not all unto which man was tied, Being made in the image of
God; he had clear light to discern good from evil, and as all
yet retaine, darkly and obseurely; so he had the Law written in
his heart, clearly; Adultery, Murder (though no otherwise con∣demned,
then by that light which he had by creation) in that e∣state
had been sin. The former positive Law was evil because
<PB N="104" REF="70"/>
forbidden, take away the prohibition, and there had been no sin
in eating. These are forbidden, because evil: The Law imprint∣ed
by creation, being presupposed, there needed no further Law
to make them sinful. They that never had the written Law, are
condemned for these practices, by that Law which by nature is
written in their hearts. But against these, there was in nature an
Antipathy; Mans pure nature had them in abhorrency. As
now there needs no Law more then nature doth suggest, to for∣bid
the eating of poyson, feeding on dust, or carrion: So
then there needed no more Law to condemne these practices; so
that obedience in that state was in mans power must necessarily be
yeelded.</P>
<P>The conditions of the covenant of Grace are not performed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conditi∣ons in the Co∣venant of Grace are not performed without special assistance.</NOTE>
but by special grace; a power from God must concurre for their
work in man; Man hath no abilities in himself to answer what
God requires, and if he rise not up to the terms of this covenant,
till he raise himselfe, he will for ever fall short of it. As the
covenant was vouchsafed of grace, so grace must make us meet
to partake of the benefits of it.</P>
<P>This appears.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons.</NOTE> 1. In the state and condition in which God
findes man, when he first enters covenant with him; yea, after
covenant entred, till a change be wrought, and abilities confer∣red
to answer that which God in covenant requires. This state
of man the Apostle expresses, <HI>Ephes. 2. 1. Dead in trespasses and
sins,</HI> alive, and in power for nothing at all, but sinne. This was
the condition of Heathens, never in covenant; and so of the
Jews who were a people in actual covenant, and owned of God
as his inheritance, as God willing shall be shewn. Their con∣versation
was the same as the Apostle there confesseth; <HI>Among
whom we also had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of the
flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the minde, and were by
nature the children of wrath as well as others.</HI> This in abundant
other expressions in Scripture is discovered, holding forth the
same thing, <HI>Rom. 5. 6. For when we were yet without strength, in
due time Christ died for the ungodly.</HI> That infant, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 4, 5.
had no more possibilities of life, then is to be found even in the
state of death.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. It appears in that power which is exercised by God, in
the change of those in covenant with him, whom he fits for him∣self
<PB N="105" REF="70"/>
for Eternity. This power in Scripture is set out, in several ex∣pressions.
First, <HI>Creation,</HI> Ephes. 2. 10. <HI>We are his workmanship, created
in Christ Jesus unto good works.</HI> All ability to good is from the
frame into which grace puts us; As there is a power out of man,
which gives him Being, So also there is an answerable power,
for his new Being; <HI>He that is begotten of God, keepeth him∣self,
and the evil one toucheth him not,</HI> 1 John 5. 18.
Secondly, <HI>Quickning.</HI> The dead have not power to raise them∣selves,
without a further power for their Resurrection; Neither
is it in the power of man, <HI>Who is dead in trespasses and sinnes,</HI> Eph.
2. 1. Thirdly, <HI>Taking away the heart of stone, and giving an heart of
flesh,</HI> Ezek. 36. 26. To change the nature of things, which is here
done, is the work of an Omnipotence, which was Satans argument
not denied by Christ, <HI>If thou be the Son of God, command these stones
to be made bread,</HI> Mat. 4. 3. Fourthly, <HI>Causing to walk in Gods statutes,</HI>
Ezek. 36. 27. A work as of authority, so of power. Fifthly, <HI>Plucking
out of the power of Satan,</HI> an act of the free grace and power of God,
2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 26. Sixthly, <HI>Drawing,</HI> A work of power in him that draws,
weaknesse in him that is drawn. <HI>Joh. 6. 44. No man can come unto me,
except the Father which hath sent me draw him.</HI> And therefore the
Spouse prayeth, <HI>Draw me, and we will run after thee,</HI> Cant. 1. 4.
There must be more power in God for conversion, than in Satan
for the souls ruine. Grace must have advantage of temptation,
but Satan can allure, perswade; Our first parents had woful expe∣rience
of his faculty this way, He hath his moral perswasions, If
God make use of nothing more, they are even; yea, Satan hath
the advantage, by so much as we are more apt for sinne than obe∣dience.
And, as these metaphorical expressions hold it forth; So in
plain termes it is exprest in Scripture. The Apostle prayes for the
<HI>Ephesians,</HI> that the <HI>eyes of their understanding being enlightened, they
may know what is the exceeding greatnesse of Gods power, to those that
beleeve, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought
in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,</HI> Ephes. 1. 19. And by
way of <HI>simile</HI> makes Application, <HI>ch. 2. verse 1. &amp;c. Even when
we were dead in sins, hath he quickned us together with Christ, and
hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places
in Christ Jesus,</HI> Ephes. 2. 5. Lest any should say the former Me∣taphors
are stretched above their line; when they are brought in
to hold forth that for which they have been produced; the Apo∣stle
<PB N="106" REF="71"/>
here makes application, and shews that the like mighty pow∣er,
which was exercised of God, in raising Christ, dead in the
grave, and setting him up above all principalities and powers,
is exercised in raising those who are dead in sin, to sit in heavenly
places with Christ. The Apostle entring a similitude, <HI>chap.</HI> 1. 19.
makes not an end of it till, <HI>chap. 2. v.</HI> 8. Only having named the
exaltation of Christ upon his Resurrection, does not leave till he
have shewed how high he is exalted; and having named mans
low ebbe in sin; does not leave till he hath set out how low; which
drawes out the similitude to such length, in which this truth is
set forth unto us, which comparison with the application, leaves
the necessity of an Omnipotent concurrence in this work without
exception.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. This further appears in that inability which is in man,
to accept that which God of grace doth tender, unlesse God cure
the faculties by his power. He is wanting, 1. In power to under∣stand,
or to discerne the glory of that grace which is offered:
<HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
are foolishnesse unto him; neither can be know them, because they are
spiritually discerned,</HI> 1 Cor. 2. 14. This native blindnesse in man;
with the necessity of an Omnipotency for cure, is plain, not only
in the Heathens, who (wanting the light of Revelation,) are, as
St. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks, darknesse; But also in those to whom light is
brought, and the word preacht; that stand in actual covenant
with God, as appears▪ <HI>Deut. 29. 1. &amp;</HI> 4. Compared, <HI>The Lord
hath not given you a heart to perceive,</HI> (speaking to men in cove∣nant)
<HI>and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.</HI> 2. In will
to desire, and heart to embrace any such tender; but on the con∣trary
there is a readinesse still to oppose, which is plain, not one∣ly
by the stirres that are raised wheresoever the word is preach't,
as we see through the History of the <HI>Acts,</HI> So that it is grown
into a Proverb, <HI>Evangelicum ciet bellum,</HI> But also by the strug∣lings
to withstand any motion or conviction which the Word
works; what <HI>Stephen</HI> tells the Jews that they did, that each man by
nature is apt to do, <HI>to resist the Holy Ghost. Acts</HI> 7. 51. There is
much resistance in the heart, which grace by power does not ut∣terly
take away, but overcome and subdue.</P>
<P>4ly This appears in Gods indication, and full declaration of him∣self,
what his work is, &amp; what is to be expected from his hand in the
<PB N="107" REF="71"/>
covenant-conditions which he requires of us, which we finde from
his mouth in several Texts of Scripture. <HI>The Lord thy God will cir∣cumcise
thy heart, and the heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God.</HI>
Deut. 30. 6. <HI>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit I will
put within you; I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and
I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes,</HI>
Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27. But especially in that Text, <HI>Jer. 31. 31, 32,
33, 34. The dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new
covenant with the house of</HI> Israel, <HI>and with the house of</HI> Judah:
<HI>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the
day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of</HI>
Egypt (<HI>which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband
to them, saith the Lord:) But this shall be the Covenant that I
will make with the house of</HI> Israel; <HI>after those days (saith the Lord) I
will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;
and will be their God, and they shall be my people, and they shall teach
no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying;
Know the Lord; for they shall all know me from the least of them to the
greatest of them, saith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and
remember their sin no more.</HI> In which Texts, a necessity of super∣natural
grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 31. 33. cleared.</NOTE> for the ends mentioned, is abundantly set out unto
us: Had man power left in nature for this work, or nature so re∣paired
in all, that abilities were universally conferred, this de∣claration
needed not. No reason can be given of these engage∣ments,
by those that deny any necessity of an Omnipotent con∣currence.
These are usually called Promises, and they runne in∣deed,
in the nature of Promises; so that they deserve not blame,
that so conceive of them. Generally taken also to be absolute
Promises, saith Mr <HI>Baxter, Aph. of Just. page</HI> 9. and being Pro∣mises,
they must indeed be absolute ones, we bring not the con∣dition
of faith to accept of them; Here is nothing prerequired, as
in Promises that are conditional; Being Promises, (if Promises)
of Grace, as some have distinguished, and not Promises to
Grace; they are spoken to those that are in their unbelief and un∣regenerate
condition; Yet that which is necessarily required to
make up a full Promise here is wanting; In Promises (properly so
called) some may claim their interest, and know themselves to
be within their verge, and conclude the thing in Promise (upon
termes at least) to be theirs, which here none can do. This indeed
<PB N="108" REF="72"/>
concernes the Elect; but being in unregeneration, they know not
their Election, it is not as yet made sure by them. So that as to us it
is without any determinate object; None can say, my interest is in
this Promise. These were delivered to the whole body of <HI>Israel;</HI>
when not one in many, did reap the benefit of them. Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>
therefore makes them Prophecies, <HI>De eventu, Prophecies of what
shall happen.</HI> I suppose they may be fitly called, the declaration
or indication of Gods work, in the conditions to which he engages,
and of the necessary concurrence, of the power of his grace,
in that which he requires: As <HI>Austin</HI> and others have interpreted,
that which is affirmed of our Saviour, <HI>That he is the true light,
which enlightneth every man that comes into the world,</HI> John 1. 9. not
to be so understood, that all in the world are enlightned by him, for
many are in darknesse; but that all that are enlightned, have light
by his light, explaining it with this similitude: Such a School∣master
teacheth all the children in a Town; that is, all that are
taught, he teacheth. Some go to no School at all, so, these Pro∣mises,
<HI>I will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed;</HI> All of
their seed that are circumcised in heart, he circumcises, and so in all
the other, none of all these are done without his special work.
This was little heeded by the generality of the people of the Jews;
if they minded duty, it was well, they little thought of assistance
through grace; Tugging it out by their own strength, and looking
for no more from heaven, than that which they had in hand;
Therefore entring Covenant; and walking in their own strength;
they brake Covenant, and were never able to rise to the duties of
it, as is hinted in that of <HI>Jeremy.</HI> Therefore God promises a
new covenant, in which there shall be a full discovery, and right
understanding, of the meaning of the Covenant; <HI>I will write my
Law in their hearts, I will put it into their inward parts.</HI> So that
as the commandment of love was a new commandment; so this
covenant was a new covenant, both given of old, both a new clear∣ed,
for a right understanding. <HI>There was nothing wrong</HI> (saith
Mr. <HI>Dixon) in the former Covenant, but it was imperfect, and all
things in it were not expressed clearly.</HI> Annot. on <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 7. That
which was chiefly defective (as it seems) was this here mentioned,
and therefore Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> sayes well, that this place doth com∣prize
but part of the covenant, not the whole, though he be ta∣ken
up by another for it in these words, <HI>God saying expressely, this
<PB N="109" REF="72"/>
is my Covenant; to say it is not, is not to interpret the Word, but to
deny it;</HI> God sayes to the People of <HI>Israel, Is not this the fast that
I have chosen, to loose the bands of wickednesse, to undo every burden?</HI>
If any one should interpret that Text, would he say the whole
of a Religious Fast, is there exprest, and a full definition of a Fast
laid down? or would he instead of interpreting, deny that Scrip∣ture?
So also that of <HI>James,</HI> Jam. 1. 26. <HI>Pure religion and un∣defiled
before God the Father, is this; To visit the fatherlesse and
the widow, and to keep a man unspotted of the world.</HI> Will any say,
that the whole of Religion is set out in that Scripture, or will he be
put to it, to deny the Scripture? I suppose he would rather say, that
that which those Jews (to whom <HI>Isay</HI> speaks) did in &amp; use to do Re∣ligious
Fasts with supply of that which <HI>Isay</HI> calls for (in which they
were defective) makes up a Religious Fast compleat. That which
the scattered Tribes did in Religion; with what <HI>James</HI> further calls
for, would render a man entirely Religious: So also that of <HI>Je∣remy
22. 15, 16. Shalt thou reigne, because thou closest thy self
in Cedar? Did not thy father, eat and drink and do justice and judg∣ment,
and then it was well with him? He judged the cause of the
poor and needy, and then it was well with him; was not this to know
me, saith the Lord?</HI> Will any say, that that was all the knowledge
that <HI>Josiah</HI> had of God? or will he say rather, that this was an evi∣dent
proof of the sincerity of it; so I say, that which the Jews already
understood to be in the covenant, together with that which
those places of <HI>Jeremy</HI> and the <HI>Hebrews</HI> further hold forth, set
out the entire nature of a covenant; and so in all of them, Scri∣pture
is interpreted, not denied. And whereas one affirmes, that
there is no condition on mans part, in those texts in question, an
adversary of all conditions on mans part in the covenant replyes.
<HI>If you mean such conditions that God requireth of us; yet worketh in
us; it is there punctually exprest.</HI> As Gods work, it is there in∣deed
exprest; but not as our duty, which lame understanding of
the covenant, hath wrought as much mischief in our age; (set∣ting
up free grace, without any eye upon his sovereignty, look∣ing
at Gods work, and not at all on mans duty) as their looking
at duty in that age without eye had to the power of grace, to en∣able
for it. Hence are those desperate counsels; <HI>Sit still, do no∣thing;
doing undoes you:</HI> and that not toward <HI>Dilemma. Art thou
out of Christ, thou mayst break thy heart in working, and profit no∣thing:
<PB N="110" REF="73"/>
Art thou in Christ, then all is wrought to thy hands.</HI> And
so doing still is vain; and Mr. <HI>Baxters Questionists</HI> like demands.
<HI>How can you make it appear that according to the new Covenant▪ we
must act for life, and not only from life; or that a man may make his at∣taining
of life, the end of his work, and not rather obey it out of thankful∣ness
and love?</HI> To which I suppose he hath received a satisfying, and
(if throughly weighed,) a sadning answer, <HI>Appendix, p. 78. 79, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, This appears in that differencing work, which is seen
among men here in the flesh. There is a great difference between
those that are of God, and those that are in the world, that lies
in wickednesse. This is from the power of grace, enabling to an∣swer
to that unto which God in covenant calls, and not from the
different improvement of any power of man, or the exercise of
that freedome of will, which together with the whole species of
mankind he hath received. The Apostle puts the question, <HI>Who
hath made thee to differ?</HI> 1 Cor. 4. 7. In which he intends to stop
all mouths from boasting, as appears in the next words; If any
therefore shall answer in <HI>Grevenchovius</HI> his words (as I have seen
them quoted, or in any words that hold out or inferre the same
thing,) <HI>I make my self to differ:</HI> The Apostle will not sit down
by it, He expressely tells us; <HI>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him
that runneth; but of God that sheweth mercy.</HI> Rom 9. 16. If grace
makes the difference and not man; then grace enables man to
go higher than his own power, and to go higher than any power
that can be in any other. Seclude this differencing grace, and
the praise will be wholly mans. That any have power and possibi∣lity
for good, (according to these Divines) may be of God; but that
any is better than another it is from self that makes to differ.</P>

pride, saith he, be beaten down, and humility planted? If any one
should say to him, Let not any souldier glory in the sight of his father;
for what he is in armes, he is from him: So that he that glorieth,
let him glory in his father; for what hast thou that thou hast not recei∣ved?
He might very well and rationally answer (<HI>saith our learned
Authour,</HI>) why should not I glory of my atcheivments in armes? I
have received natural abilities indeed from my father, for none doth
beget himself; I have received a oommission from him, for none may
put himself into any such power; I have received also armes from him,
for neither I, nor any other souldier was born armed; neither am I any

is, he may vapour against God, upon such supposal as this soul∣dier
vapours against his father. If acts of grace make to
differ and stop the mouth of all boasting; then it is grace that
enables unto these covenant-duties and engagements.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, This appears by the absurdities that will follow upon
denial of this doctrine of the concurrence of grace in the work of
mans salvation. 1. Man being left to the power of his own will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Necessity of the concur∣rence of grace.</NOTE>
to answer to the termes of the covenant (so that all shall be sus∣pended
according to mans improvement to will or nill, to be
active or idle, willing or disobedient,) when the event in all, e∣ven
in the Elect must rest doubtful; when Christ hath done all in
the work of mans salvation, it might (notwithstanding all such
work of his) so fall out, that he had effected nothing. He might
have been a Saviour, and not one man in the world have been sa∣ved;
He might have been a Head, without any one member; a
Shepherd, and not a sheep in his flock; a Lord, and never a one
to have done him any service. It might have so fallen out, that
he might never have been able to have said to the Father; <HI>I, and
the children that thou hast given, &amp;c.</HI> This is evident; As some
have withstood, so might others; As the most withstand, so
might all. Yea, it would have been no otherwise, If Gods
Ministers should go forth, and the hand of the Lord not with
them to work men to beleeve, <HI>Acts.</HI> 11. 21. But this is full a∣gainst
Gods covenant with Christ, which must stand firme and in∣violably
remain. <HI>He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his dayes;
<PB N="112" REF="74"/>
the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand,</HI> Isa. 53. 10, 11
<HI>Therefore it is of grace, that it may be sure;</HI> not of man, that it
should be doubtful. 2. Then it will also follow, the work of
mans salvation begins in an act; not in an habit; in somewhat
that a man does respective to God, and not in any thing that
God does in and upon man. The first beginning work will be as∣cribed
to him that wills and runs, not to him that shews mercy.
But this is contrary to all Gospel-Revelations, concerning the
way of our change: <HI>I will circumcise thy heart, that thou shalt love
the Lord with all thy heart, &amp;c.</HI> Deut. 30. 6. <HI>I will write my
Law in their hearts, and put it into their inward parts, as</HI> Jer 31. 33.
<HI>No man can come to me, except the Father draw him,</HI> Joh. 6. 44. <HI>I will
take away their hearts of stone, and give them hearts of flesh,</HI> Ezek 36.
26. If man were alone in the work, or had the priorety before
any power infused, there had been none of these undertakings. 3.
This will make vain and void the prayers of the people of
God, which in the Scripture is put into their mouths; <HI>Draw me,
and we will runne,</HI> Cant. 1. 4. <HI>Turn thou us, O Lord, and so shall
we be turned,</HI> Lament. 5. 21. <HI>Create in me a clean heart, and renue a
right spirit;</HI> acknowledging their own weaknesse to do, and a neces∣sity
of grace to effect, what in order to their salvation is called for.</P>
<P>7ly. If the Apostle may be heard, his authority will put it out of
question, Exhorting <HI>to work out our own salvation with fear and
trembling,</HI> which is done no other way than in coming up to
that which God calls for in covenant, he gives in his reason for
encouragement; <HI>It is God that works in us the will and the deed.</HI>
The special hand and power of God concurring in this works, is
our encouragement from the Apostle to set upon it. How can
he encourage to this work upon this account that God works in
us, to will and to do, if there were not a work of God upon us
before there be any such work done by us? We work, but he sets
us on working; We will, but he sets us on willing; Let all the glos∣ses
that have ever been put upon these words to promote the will
and work of man; and enervate the free grace of God, in the
great concernments of salvation, be examined, and they will all
fall of themselves before this Text of the Apostle. See Dr. <HI>Ward</HI>
in his Sermon called <HI>Gratia discriminans.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Objections against the former doctrine answered.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BUt some say, Absurdities, and those not a few follow upon this
Doctrine.</HI><MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="Object."/> Then salvation in this new Covenant, is as impossible
for a man, as in the old, had he still remained under a Covenant of
Works. If we can no more rise up to the termes of the Covenant
of grace than we can to the Covenant of works, where then is the
difference?</P>
<P>To which I answer; <MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> that a man void of grace can no more be
saved by the Covenant of Grace, than a man under an impossibi∣lity
to work can be saved by the Covenant of Works, will easily
be granted. <HI>By grace we are saved,</HI> Ephes. 2. 8. <HI>not of our selves.</HI>
It is still equally impossible in both to be self-savours. Here is
the difference. Grace raises us, unto that to which the Gos∣pel
calls us, in a self-denying way through faith; but works
us not to that self perfection in those degrees of inherent righte∣ousnesse,
as to be saved by works.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>This doctrine layes man as low as a stock or a stone; a dead
carcasse, nothing is done by him but what is done in him, and so must
needs be injurious to man.</HI><MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="Object."/> To this I answer. First, it layes him no low∣er
than sin hath cast him, nor doth it make him worse than sin hath
made him,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> and the Word of God doth discover him, and that is
dead till grace quicken and raise him. His heart is of stone till grace,
take it from him, and in enmity against God, till grace
circumcise and work that change, to love the Lord with all the
heart, &amp;c. Secondly, This is not an absolute death, in which man is,
through sin, and therefore the similitude holds not, that equals a
stock, stone, or dead carcasse with him; It is only a death respective,
as to spiritual obedience he is dead, There is in him a life natural,
able for all actions and motions of the life of man as man, There is
in him also a moral life, able to improve naturals to a civilized con∣versation.
That to which feare or hope can work a man, thither he
may raise himself by the freedome of will, this puts no new life
into him, nor works any chang of nature in him. He is also able for
those works which God sanctifies as his instrument, for the work of
a spiritual life, He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> read and hear the Word, hath power to
know much in it, and retain it. Thirdly, he is a subject suscep∣tible,
<PB N="114" REF="75"/>
slands in a capacity of a life of grace, of spiritual actions
and motions: having an understanding, will, affections, wanting
not any faculties in their substance. The new man attaines not a
new soul, but only renewed qualifications, which yet are of more
glory, than the faculties themselves, carrying such a glorious re∣semblance
of God. Better know nothing than not know God, to
desire nothing, than not to desire good. The want of this, turned
Angels into Devils, and so man stands in a vast difference from
stocks, stones and those to whom he is thus injuriously compa∣red.
This doctrine is not injurious to man, as it is tradu∣ced.<MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="Object."/></P>
<P>Thirdly, some say, <HI>This will render preaching vaine, all mans-paines
for Conversion of soules will then prove uselesse, and to no pur∣pose;
we may let men alone till God work; and when he hath begun
his work, they will set on working.</HI> This indeed speaks hard to a
sort of men in our times; that deny any previous working in the
soul for regeneration, or any preparatory work to conversion,
So that all uncoverted, stand equally distant from the grace of
it, in so much that it can be said of no one rather than another,
which Christ said to the Scribe, <HI>Thou art not far from the Kingdome
of God,</HI> Mar. 12. 34. I see not how these can make the preaching of
the word of any use; Our Brethren that went into <HI>America,</HI>
and offer the Gospel to savage Indians there, may as well finde
Christ there, as bring him thither. The dark places of the earth
may be equally happy, with those, where light is in most glory, if
light contribute nothing to the work of change, and the happy
frame of Christ in us. But those that have learnt, that infused ha∣bits
are wrought in the soul in the same manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habitus infusi infunduntur ad m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dum acquisi∣torum.</NOTE> as those that are
acquired, may easily return a satisfying answer. That opinion▪
that the soul is by an immediate creation infused, how generally
soever it is received, yet never was thought of force to render the
way of marriage uselesse for procreation; God infuses not a soul
by creation into any, but an organized body, an Embryo fitted
to receive it. Neither can this opinion of the power of grace in the
work of Conversion, render in vain the labours of those that are
spiritual Parents. Conviction is in order before Conversion, and
men must see themselves necessitated to do what they do, before
ever they enter upon it. The soule knoweth what it doth, when
it first beleeves, and sees a necessity to accept Christ before it re∣ceives
<PB N="115" REF="75"/>
him, which is the work of the Word in the soules, of those
that are brought to Christ Jesus. It is not in vaine for God to
send his Ministers to shew the mysteries of the Kingdome of hea∣ven
to those that are blinde, when this is the way of God to
open their eyes and give them sight. It is not in vain that he
sends them to those that are without strength, when this is his
way to enable them with power. It is not in vain that <HI>Paul</HI>
plants, and <HI>Apollos</HI> waters, when yet it is God that gives the in∣crease,
when God will use <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Apollos</HI> for the increase that
he gives. Ministers should perswade, and people improve en∣deavours
as though they were <HI>Pelagians,</HI> and no help of grace affor∣ded,
They should pray and beleeve, and rest on grace as though
they were <HI>Antinomians,</HI> nothing of endeavour to be looked
after; So the injury that the <HI>Pelagian</HI> doth to grace,
and the <HI>Antinomian</HI> to our endeavours, will be on both hands a∣voided.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Farther differences in the conditions in the Covenant of
Works, and the conditions in the Covenant
of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>2ly. THe conditions, on mans part in the Covenant of Works,
kept man within him self for righteousnesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conditi∣ons in the Co∣venant of Works kept man within himself for righteousnesse.</NOTE> That righ∣teousnesse
in which he was to stand in Gods sight, was inhe∣rent,
wrought by himself; co-natural to him, flowing from the
principles of his creation, in conformity to God. And therefore
properly his own; as now a mans reason, will and affections are
properly his, He needed no other, nor no more righteousnesse than
that in which he stood. Though he had that faith which now
serves to justifie; yet it needed not, nor could be improved to
take in any other righteousnesse without himself for justification.
Man stood then on his own bottome. His dependance was on
God for being, but that being, which God pleased to communicate,
was in that integrity and purity, that he needed not any far∣ther.
But the conditions of the Covenant of Grace, carry man out
<PB N="116" REF="76"/>
of himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conditi∣ons in the Co∣venant of Grace, carry a man out of himself to be righteous by anothers righ∣teousnesse.</NOTE> He must be righteous with a righteousness extrinsecal,
or else he will never be able to stand in judgment. <HI>Paul</HI> was as
high, as he that was highest, in that righteousnesse, which he could
lay claime to, as his own, wrought by himself, as well before con∣version
as after. Before conversion he was as high, as a Pharisee,
or a Jew according to the letter could reach, either in priviledges,
or duties; as we may see in that gradation of his, <HI>Phil. 3. Cir∣cumcised,</HI>
and therefore of the body of the people of God, and
no alien from the Common-wealth of <HI>Israel; Circumcised the
eighth day,</HI> and therefore born of Parents in the same Church-communion;
<HI>Of the stock of Israel,</HI> and so the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI>
and not descended of ancestors that had been Proselytes;
<HI>Of the Tribe of Benjamin,</HI> of that part of <HI>Israel</HI> that held the
truth of worship; of whom was salvation, and not of the
Apostated tribes; <HI>An Hebrew of the Hebrews,</HI> and therefore
had not forgotten the language of <HI>Canaan; As touching the Law,
a Pharisee,</HI> a man of no vulgar account, but of the most exquisite
Sect; <HI>Concerning zeal, persecuting the Church,</HI> therefore not
luke-warme or cold in the faith; <HI>As touching the righteousnesse that
is of the Law blamelesse,</HI> therefore of a conversation exact, walk
up to his principles. After conversion, <HI>he knew nothing by him∣self,</HI>
1 Cor. 4. 4. His heart condemned him not, <HI>He exercised
himself continually to have a conscience void of offence, both to God
and man,</HI> Acts 24. 16. Yet he durst rest, in none of these, <HI>I am not</HI>
(saith he) <HI>hereby justified,</HI> 1 Cor. 4. 4. <HI>What things were gain to
me, those I counted losse for Christ; yea, doubtlesse, and I count all
things but losse for the excellency of the knowledg of Christ Jesus
my Lord; for whom I have suffered the losse of all things, and do
count them but dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not
having my own righteousnesse, which is of the Law; but that which is
through faith of Christ, the righteousnesse which is of God by faith,</HI>
Philip. 3. 7, 8, 9. The ignorance of this, was the bane of the
body of the Jewish Nation. <HI>The Gentiles which followed not after
righteousnesse, have attained to righteousnesse, even the righteous∣nesse
which is of faith. But</HI> Israel <HI>which followed after the Law of
righteousnesse, hath not attained to the Law of righteousnesse;
wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the
works of the Law,</HI> Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32. <HI>For they being ignorant of
Gods righteousnesse, and going about to establish their own righteous∣nesse,
<PB N="117" REF="76"/>
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousnesse of God,</HI>
Rom. 10. 3. And still, it is the undoing of a great part of the
world; Man being naturally inclined, to look after a righteous∣nesse
of his own, and extreamely opposite to this righteousnesse,
which in the covenant of grace is tendered, and by which in a
Gospel-way he must be saved. The righteousnesse of the former
covenant, was wrote in the heart by nature; and such remain∣ders
left, that the man that minds any righteousnesse, alone looks
after it. But this, is onely of Revelation, He must have light
without him to lead to this righteousnesse, which is not his own,
nor inherent in him: What naturally he did not know, he is
naturally ready to oppose and refuse. Men know not how,
till they be taught of God, to see a reason of it; or to un∣derstand
that it is of any use. A man may be wise with an∣other
mans wit, strong with another mans strength, learn∣ed
by another mans knowledge, as well as righteous (as they
conceive) by another mans righteousnesse: Hence are the
scornes that are put upon it, and the Treatises that are wrote
against it; <HI>Vain man would faine be somewhat, as wise,</HI>
Job 11. 12. <HI>so also righteous.</HI> This takes all from man, strips
him of all in, which he may glory, as <HI>Romans</HI> 3. 27. This
which man so opposeth, the covenant of grace establish∣eth;
And that which he so advanceth, the covenant of grace
disclaimes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conditi∣ons in the Co∣venant of works were for mans pre∣servation in present happi∣nesse.</NOTE></P>
<P>3. <HI>The conditions on mans part in the covenant of works were
for mans preservation in</HI> statu quo; <HI>in that condition in which
he was created,</HI> To hold him in communion with God,
which was his happinesse; he expected not to be bettered by his
obedience, either respective to happinesse (no more is promised
than in present he had,) nor yet in his qualifications respective
to his conformity to God in righteousnesse and true holinesse.
What improvement he might have made of the habit infused, by
the exercise of obedience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conditi∣ons in the Co∣venant of grace are for mans reparation.</NOTE> I shall not determine, But no
change in qualifications was looked after, or given in pro∣mise.</P>
<P><HI>The conditions of the covenant of grace are serviceable to man
in his return to God, for his recovery, as to his state of happinesse

in that which follows, Other differences there are as∣signed

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Faith is a condition of the Covenant of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING asserted conditions, in the covenant of grace,
and held forth several differences between the conditions,
in the covenant of works, and in the covenant of grace, we are
now further to enquire, what these conditions are, that are cal∣led
for in this covenant, on which we treat: Those Divines, that
with concurrent judgments, acknowledge this covenant to be
conditional, are not yet, so unanimous, in their assignation of
them. For a full discovery, some things are to be premised, as
truths taken for granted, rather than disputed 1. That God
covenants with man, and engages himself to him, not onely for
justification, but also for salvation. Not onely for pardon of
sinne, but everlasting life and glory. Not onely to be reconciled
to him; but to conferre eternal happinesse upon him. 2. What∣soever
God requires of man, in order, either to his justification,
or salvation, without which he is not justified, or saved, and
man engages unto, in order to his justification, or salvation, this
is a covenant condition. This I take to be clear, in case there be
any such thing, as a condition in any covenant, and it is also
granted by a professed adversary of all conditions in the covenant
of grace, <HI>faith and repentance are</HI> (saith he) <HI>means, of our enjoying
the comforts of the covenant, but not conditions going out of the nature
of a covenant; for every means, is not a condition, though every
condition be a means; but, when a means is by stipulation, and
contract appointed; for the acquiring of any thing, then it is a con∣dition.</HI>
Whatsoever then we can finde, thus required of God, in
this way of contract, and stipulation; is a condition by the con∣fession
of our adversaries. 3. Whatsoever is required of man,
<PB N="119" REF="77"/>
in order to his justification, is a condition of his justification, and
all that is required, in order to his eternal salvation, is, a con∣dition
of salvation, God making tender of both, and man enga∣ging
himself to seek both, whatsoever is required in order to ei∣ther,
respective to that, is a condition. 4. That, which is a con∣dition
of justification, is also a condition of salvation, in that, sal∣vation
presupposes a justified estate, but, it holds not on the
contrary, that, which is, a condition of salvation, is not there∣fore
a condition of justification. More is required, to hold us up,
in constant communion with God, then to bring us into a state
of actual reconcilement to God. This being premised, the work
will be more easie, to assigne conditions in this covenant. The
condition, immediately serviceable, for mans return to a reconci∣led
state with God; and consequently of his justification, is faith,
which almost all acknowledge to be a condition, and <HI>Camero,</HI> with
several others, makes it to be, the sole condition of the covenant.
A condition it is, as, is above contradiction, <HI>John. 3. 15, 16. God
so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that, whoso∣ever
believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life,</HI>
Mark 16. 16. <HI>He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved;
but, he that beleeveth not, shall be damned.</HI> Acts 10. 43. <HI>To him,
give all the Prophets witnesse, that thorough his name; whosoever be∣lieveth
in him, shall receive remission of sinnes,</HI> Acts 13. 38, 39.
<HI>Be it known unto you therefore men, and brethren; that through this
man, is preached unto you forgivenesse of sinnes. And by him, all
that beleeve, are justified from all things from which, ye could, not
be justified, by the Law of Moses,</HI> Acts 16. 31. <HI>Believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy whole house,</HI> Rom.
3. 25. <HI>Whom God hath set forth, to be a propitiation through faith in
his blood,</HI> Rom. 10. 4. <HI>Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness,
to every one that believeth.</HI> In all these texts, and several others,
faith is required of men, in covenant, and if men did not engage to
beleeve, they could not be so much as professed covenanters. This is
in reason further evident.</P>
<P>1. That which gives us interest in the Mediator of the covenant,
without which we have no title to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons con∣vincing Faith to be a condi∣tion of the Covenant of grace.</NOTE> or portion in him; is a con∣dition
of the covenant: This is plain of it self, without interest in
the Mediator of the covenant, we are as though no covenant were
entred, and the former distance held up. But it is faith that gives us
<PB N="120" REF="78"/>
interest in Christ the Mediatour, He dwells in us by faith, <HI>Ephes.
3. 17. He is set forth a propitiation through Faith in his blood;</HI>
They that believe receive him, <HI>John</HI> 1. 12. Others hold a
distance from him; <HI>To as many as received him, to them he gave
power to be the sonnes of God, even to those that beleeve in his
Name.</HI></P>
<P>2. That which receives all that grace gives, must needs be a con∣dition
of the covenant of grace; This is as plain, to be under a
covenant of grace, and void of the gifts of grace is a vain entrance
upon it, and the reception of the gift is a condition necessarily
requisite. But Faith receives all that grace gives; It is of
Fath that it might be of grace, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 16. God gives nothing,
at least tending to eternity, but he puts it into the hands of
Christ; He is the Fathers treasury and store-house, <HI>Col. 1. 19.
It pleased the Father that in him all fulnesse should dwell. And that of
his fulnesse we should all receive, Joh.</HI> 1. 16. And faith receives al from
him, <HI>He that believeth, out of his belly flowes rivers of living water.</HI>
Joh. 7. 38.</P>
<P>3. That which interest us in, and gives title to all priviledges, of
a people in covenant with God through Christ, is a condition of
the covenant: This is plaine, the end of the covenant being to
conferre those priviledges upon us; But Faith interests us in,
and gives title to all these priviledges, <HI>Paul</HI> is sent to the Gentiles,
to turne them <HI>from Satan to God, to bring them out of Satans
kingdome,</HI> and to bring them in a covenant-way into Christs
Kingdome, <HI>That they may receive forgivenesse of sins, and an inhe∣ritance
among them that are sanctified</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>by faith that
is in me.</HI> Christ is the object of a Christians faith, on whom it is
terminated; Faith which is in Christ, receives that leading priviledg,
forgivenesse of sins; without this priviledge we are strangers to
all other priviledges; Being under sinne, we are heires of wrath,
and in no capacity of mercy. Faith interests us in this. <HI>Acts 10.
43. To him give all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name,
whosoever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins.</HI> Acts 13.
39. <HI>And by him, all that beleeve are justified, from all things from
which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses.</HI> Rom. 3. 25.
<HI>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,
to declare his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes that are past,
through the forbearance of God.</HI> Faith interests us in the consum∣mating
<PB N="101" REF="78"/>
priviledge, an inheritance among them that are sanctified.
<HI>He that believeth hath everlasting life, John</HI> 6. 40. Faith interests
us in all intermediate priviledges, which a man in covenant can en∣joy
in the way to this inheritance. Adoption of sonnes is this way
obtained, <HI>John 1. 12. Gal.</HI> 3. 26. Pacification of Spirit, Serenity
and tranquility of minde, <HI>Isa. 26. 3. Rom.</HI> 5. 1. Boldnesse at the
throne of grace, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3. 12. There is no priviledge bot∣tomed
on Christ, that hath foundation in him, but
Faith receives, Faith then must be a condition of the cove∣nant.</P>
<P>4. That which puts into a capacity to receive the mercies of the
covenant; held forth in Promise, is a condition of the covenant,
and the want of it strips off all hope and expectation of it; But
Faith puts into a capacity to receive all the graces of the covenant
given in promise; <HI>Said I not unto thee, if thou wilt beleeve, thou
shalt see the glory of God?</HI> John 11. 40. God exerts and glorifies
his power in great things for good unto those that exercise the
grace of Faith. <HI>Paul saw the Creeple had faith to be healed,</HI> Acts
14. 9. Sure if there be such a thing as a condition in any cove∣nant,
in the world any such thing as a conditional covenant, then
sure faith is a condition of the covenant of grace; Some conceive
an absolute covenant made of God for grace, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. 33.
This with me is very disputable, and I have given my reasons.
But the covenant made to grace, must needs suppose grace. There
is no covenant for happinesse made with any creature, but upon
termes and conditions.</P>
<P>For further clearing of this point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what sense faith is here taken.</NOTE> we must know that faith
is considered under a double notion. First, as an instrument,
or (if that word will not be allowed) as the way of our
interest in Christ, and priviledges by Christ. Secondly, as
an inherent grace or Christian duty to which both the Law and
the Gospel call. The radical grace from which others flow,
though not in their being, yet in their farther growth and en∣crease.
I speak of Faith now in the first acception. Neither as a
part, or any way a working cause, of the farther progresse in inhe∣rent
righteousnesse, so it will come in the second place, but as
interesting us in another righteousnesse, and so I say it is a con∣dition
in the covenant of grace, immediately serviceable for our
returne to God, and reconciliation in Christ. For clear∣ring
<PB N="102" REF="79"/>
of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propositions tending to clear the point in hand.</NOTE> I shall clear it in some propositions.</P>
<P>First, <HI>God will by no means justifie a wicked person, no man in
sin shall stand and live in his sight.</HI> He that hath made a Law to
forbid it, ordained hell for the punishment of it, will not justifie
the person that is convinced and found guilty of it. Some say
it is against his essence. The justice of God (which is God) ties
him to take vengeance, sure I am it is against his declaration of
himself, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34. 7. when he sets out his name in several parti∣culars,
this is one, <HI>by no means clearing the guilty.</HI> Some indeed
have said (conceiting with themselves thereby to promote
free grace,) that God justifies sinners as sinners, which,
as it must needs, if true, bring in the salvation of all, <HI>à


quatenus ad omne valet argumentum,</HI> then a man need no
more but sinne, to conclude his salvation, and the more sinne, the
stronger evidence; so, it is utterly destructive to the Gospel,
and overthrows the whole work of Christs merit, as the Apostle
saith, <HI>If righteousnesse be by the Law, then, Christ is dead in
vaine.</HI> Galatians 2. 21. So we may safely say, If a man
be justified as a sinner without a righteousnesse. So that the
truth is, God justifies as righteous, what he esteems as an abomi∣nation
in man, that he doth not himself; but this in man is an a∣bomination
to him; <HI>He that justifieth the wicked, and condemneth
the just, even they both are an abomination to the Lord,</HI> Proverbs
17. 15.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Man hath no righteousnesse of his owne, to bring in
plea for his justification, in which he can appeare before God in
judgment.</HI> This will be plaine if we consider the wayes of ac∣quital
where proceedings are just and legal. This must be, ei∣ther
as innocent, when a man can plead not guilty to that which
is given in charge; So did <HI>David</HI> when <HI>Cush,</HI> the Benjamite did
traduce him, <HI>Psalm. 7. 3. If I have done this, if there be iniquity
in my hands.</HI> And so did <HI>Paul</HI> to the charge of <HI>Tertullus,</HI> Acts
24. 13. Upon this account <HI>Pilate</HI> was willing to have acquitted
Christ, <HI>I finde no fault in this man,</HI> Luke 23. 4. Or else by way
of satisfaction or discharge of the penalty which the Law impo∣seth,
so in all penal Lawes, when the penalty is borne, the delin∣quent
is discharged. Man cannot be acquitted as innocent, his
guilt is too palpable. <HI>There is no men that sinneth n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon</HI>)
1 Kings 8. 4, 6. The Scripture hath concluded all under sinne,
<PB N="103" REF="79"/>
<HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 22. The Law speaks that language, <HI>that every mouth may
be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,</HI> Rom. 3.
19. Man is under that guilt that he is wholly silenced; which
renders the way of salvation by works impossible. Neither can he
be acquitted by way of satisfaction; where the way of pure justice
is held, the debtor under charge can never come out till he hath
paid the uttermost farthing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 26. Which here amounts to
such an heighth, that man may be ever paying, but never able to
satisfie: Our guilt is according to the majesty of him, whose Law
is transgressed, and wrath incurred. This is seen in Devils and
damned souls, who bear in their own persons the reward due to
their sinnes. That man, that must suffer it in his own person, may
well say with <HI>Cain, My punishment is greater then I can bear,</HI>
Gen. 4. 13.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Man in this sad and perplexed estate, hath yet a
righteousnesse of grace tendered him, a righteousnesse without the
Law, but witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,</HI> Rom. 3. 21. And
this is by way of discharge of his guilt by anothers suffering; Our
name was in the Obligation in case of sinne to suffer death, Christ
was pleased (by consent and covenant with the Father) to put
in his; and as he was thus obliged, so he <HI>suffered, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 18. We brake
the Law, and he bore the penalty, whether <HI>idem</HI> or <HI>tantundem,</HI> the
same in specie, or the same in value, is scarce worth dispute, So
that it be yeelded that justice was answered, and the Father sa∣tisfied,
and that we come out not on our own, but our sureties
account. And this (as I yet conceive) is by Christs passive obe∣dience;
His suffering in the flesh is our freedom, his death is our
ransome. There needs no more than innocency not to die, and when
guilt is taken away, we stand as innocent, no crime then can be
charged upon us. But to reign in life (as the Apostle speaks) to in∣herit
a crown, there is farther expected, which we not reaching,
Christs active obedience imputed to us (not adding to ours (but
being in it self compleat) is accounted ours, and we are dischar∣ged.</P>
<P><HI>And whereas some say,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> that being freed from death, upon
that very account we reigne in life, and therefore in case his
sufferings, deliver us from death, they necessarily confer upon us
life, there is not, nor can there be conceived any <HI>medium</HI> between
them.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="80"/>
I answer,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> It is true of our natural life and death, A man not
dead, is alive. But taking [death] in Scripture-sense, for the wages,
of sin, which comprizes (as we have heard) all misery, and [life]
for an immarcessible crown of glory, there may be a <HI>medium</HI> con∣ceived
between them, and is not onely conceived, but assigned by
Papists in their <HI>Limbus infantum.</HI> Neither will it serve to say
that Christs active obedience, served onely for a qualification to
fit him for the work of suffering; none but innocent man free
from sin, could be a sacrifice for sinne, seeing Christ had been in∣nocent,
though he had never come under the Law, to have yeeld∣ed
that obedience. His person had not been, as ours, under the
Law, unlesse of his own accord he <HI>had been made under the Law,
Gal.</HI> 4. 4. Somewhat might be said for the subjection of the hu∣mane
nature in Christ, the manhood of Christ, which was a crea∣ture,
but the person of Christ God-man, seemes to be above sub∣jection,
Much may be said for the subjection of the Sonne of
<HI>David,</HI> so considered, he may say with <HI>David, I am thy servant,
and the sonne of thy handmaid,</HI> but not so of the Lord of <HI>David,</HI>
had he not for our sakes made himself a servant; We know the
mortality of the humane nature, yet Christ had never died, un∣lesse
he had made himself obedient unto death, neither needed
he to have served unlesse he had humbled himself, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. to take
upon him the forme of a servant. See the confession of Faith,
agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines, <HI>chap. 8. sect</HI> 5. and Dr.
<HI>Featlies</HI> speeches upon it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>This righteousnesse of Christ, whether passive or active,
or both passive and active, is made ours by faith.</HI> This is our way
of interest and appropriation of it to our selves, Faith and no o∣ther
grace, this grace and no other Gospel-work, gives us title;
and therefore, as it is called <HI>the righteousnesse of God,</HI> so, also <HI>the
righteousnesse of faith;</HI> These two, are promiscuously used and taken,
for one another, <HI>Rom. 10. 3, 4. Phil</HI> 3. 8. Called the righteous∣nesse
of God, being the free gift of God, wrought by Christ who
is God, denied to be our own righteousnesse, being neither
wrought by us, or inherent in us, called the righteousnesse of
faith, not of works, not of love, not of patience, or meekness.
It is alone faith, and none of these graces that puts out it selfe to
receive it; love in a graciously disposed soul, cleaves to Christ
for communion, but receives him not for justification. These
<PB N="105" REF="80"/>
two stand as relatives, there is no soul entituled to this righteous∣nesse,
but by faith; and faith is it that entitles to it, &amp; the beleeving
soul hath interest in it, Therefore justification in Scripture is ascri∣bed
to faith, and denied to works, when neither faith, nor works
can beare us out of themselves before the tribunal of God; but
faith takes hold, and the soul by faith rests on this righteousnesse
of grace, which the Gospel tenders. It is true, that faith receives
the Spirit as well as it receives the blood of Christ, <HI>Joh. 7. 39.
Gal.</HI> 3. 14. But this is for another use, for the work of sanctifica∣tion
inherent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The acceptati∣on of Christ as a Lord, doth not justifie.</NOTE> not justification by righteousnesse imputed. And
it is also true, that faith accepts Christ as a Lord, as well as a Sa∣viour:
But it is the acceptation of him as a Saviour, not as a Lord
that justifies; Christ rules his people as a King, teacheth them as
a Prophet, but makes atonement for them onely as a Priest, by
giving himself in sacrifice; his blood for remission of sins; These
must be distinguished, but not divided, Faith hath an eye at all,
the blood of Christ, the command of Christ, the Doctrine of
Christ, but as it eyes and fastens on his blood, so it justifies. <HI>He
is set out a propitiation through faith in his blood,</HI> Romans 3. 24.
not through faith in his command, <HI>It is the blood of Christ that
cleanseth all sin, and not the Sovereignty of Christ.</HI> These con∣fusions
of the distinct parts of Christs Mediatourship; and the
several offices of faith may not be suffered. Scripture assignes
each its particular place and work. Sovereignty doth not cleanse
us, nor doth blood command us; faith in his blood, not faith
yeelding to his Sovereignty doth justifie us. There are several acts
or fruits of justifying faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. But all are not justifying; It is
not <HI>Abrahams</HI> obedience, <HI>Moses</HI> self-denial, <HI>Gideon</HI> or <HI>Sampsons</HI>
valour that was their justification, but his blood (in which faith a∣lone
gives interest) who did enable them in these duties, by his Spirit.
<HI>Paul</HI> went in these duties as high as they, living in more clear light,
and under more abundant grace, I doubt not but he out-topt them,
and yet he was not thereby justified, as 1 <HI>Cor. 4. 4. James</HI> indeed
saith, that <HI>Abraham was justified by works, when he had offered</HI> Isaac
<HI>his son on the Altar,</HI> James 2. 21. But either there we must under∣stand
<HI>a working faith</HI> with <HI>Piscator, Paraeus, Pemble,</HI> and others,
and confesse that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> handle two distinct questi∣ons;
The one, whether faith alone justifies without works; which
he concludes in the affirmative. The other, what faith justifies,
<PB N="106" REF="81"/>
whether a working faith onely, and not a faith that is dead and
idle; or else I know not how to make sense of the Apostle, who
streight inferres from <HI>Abrahams</HI> justification by the offer of his
sonne. <HI>And the Scripture was fulfilled, that saith,</HI> Abraham <HI>be∣leeved
God, and it was accounted to him for righteousnesse.</HI> How
otherwise do these accord? He was justified by works, and the
Scripture was fulfilled, that saith, he was justified by faith; Nei∣ther
can I reconcile what he saith, if this be denied, with the
whole current of the Gospel. The Rhemists indeed understand
those texts of the Apostle, where he excludes works from justifi∣cation,
to be meant of mans moral works, done before faith and
conversion; The works of the Law done without Christ, <HI>Annot.
in Rom.</HI> 3. 20, 28. As though the Law did not command those
duties, unto which Christ through faith strengthens a Christian
converted by grace; And when the Apostle concludes the im∣possibility
of being justified by the works of the Law, his mean∣ing
should be unlesse grace assist the Law, that it may justifie: This
could not be, the Apostle calls it a righteousnesse of God with∣out
the Law, not a righteousnesse of the Law, with addition of
strength from the Gospel; All works before or after conversion
inherent in us, or wrought by us, are excluded from justification.
See <HI>Ravanellus in verbum, Justificatio. Num. 3. page</HI> 867. This ju∣stification
wrought freely by grace through faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 24. is
no way consistent with justification by works. And what the
Apostle speaks of election, we may well apply to justification,
the same <HI>medium</HI> equally proves the truth of both, <HI>If by grace,
then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace. But
if it be of works, then it is no more of grace, otherwise works were
no more works,</HI> Rom 11. 6. And these things considered▪ I am
truly sorry that faith should now be denied to have the office or
place of an instrument in our justification;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith justifies as an instru∣ment.</NOTE> nay, scarce allowed to
be called the instrument of receiving Christ, that justifies us be∣cause
the act of faith (which is that which justifies us) is, our
actual receiving Christ, and therefore cannot be the instrument
of receiving. This is too subtile a notion: we use to speak other∣wise
of Faith; Faith is the eye of the soul whereby we see Christ,
and the eye is not sight. Faith is the hand of the soul whereby
it receives Christ, and the hand is not receiving, And Scripture
speaks otherwise, <HI>We receive remission of sinnes by Faith, and an in∣heritance
<PB N="107" REF="81"/>
among them that are sanctified is received by Faith,</HI> Acts
18. 26. Why else is this righteousnesse sometimes called the
righteousnesse of Faith, and sometimes the righteousnesse of God
which is by Faith, but that it is a righteousnesse which Faith re∣ceives;
<HI>Christ dwells in us by Faith,</HI> Ephes. 3. 17. By Faith we
take him in and give him entertaintment <HI>We receive the promise of
the Spirit through Faith,</HI> Gal. 3. 14. These Scriptures speak of
Faith as the souls instrument, to receive Christ Jesus, to receive
the Spirit from Christ Jesus. The instrumentality of it in the work
of justification is denied, because the nature of an instrument (as
considered in Physical operations) doth not exactly belong to it,
which if it must be alwayes rigidly followed, will often put us
to a stand in the assignation of causes of any kind in Moral acti∣ons,
The material and formal causes in justification are scarce
agreed upon, and no marvel then, in case men mind to contend
about it, that some question is raised about the instrument. But
in case we shall consider the nature and kinde of this work, about
which Faith is implied, and examine the reason and ground upon
which Faith is disabled from the office of an instrument in our
justification, and withall look into that which is brought in as an
instrument in this work in the stead of it; I do not doubt but it
will easily appear that those Divines, that with a concurrent
judgment (without almost a dissenting voice have made Faith an
instrument in this work) speak most aptly and most agreeably to
the nature of an instrument. The work about which Faith is
implied, is not an absolute, but a relative work, a work of
God towards man, not without the actual concurrence of man,
such, in which neither God nor man are sole efficients, nor any
act of God or man can be sole instruments, but there must be a
mutual concurrence of both; This must needs be granted, un∣lesse
we will bring in Doctor <HI>Crispes</HI> passive recipiency of Christ,
Christs abode in man without man, in spight of man, and suppose
him to be justified in unbelief; And hereupon faith is disabled from
this office in justification by this argument. <HI>If Faith be an instru∣ment,
it is the instrument of God, or man. 1. Not of man, for man is not
the principal efficient, he doth not justifie himself. 2. Not of
God. For (1) It is not God that beleeveth, though it is true,
God is the first cause of all actions. (2.) Man is the</HI> causa secun∣da,
<HI>between God and the action, and so still man should be said
<PB N="108" REF="82"/>
to justifie himself. (3.) For (as</HI> Aquinas) <HI>the action of the princi∣pal
cause, and of the instrument is one action; and who dare say, that
faith is so Gods instrument? (4.) The instrument must have an in∣flux
to the producing of the effect of the principal cause, by a proper
causality; &amp; who dare say that faith hath such an influx into our justi∣fication.</HI></P>
<P>I answer, It is the instrument of man; and though man do not
justifie himself, yet he concurres as a willing, ready agent with
God in it; <HI>God is a justifier of those that beleeve in Jesus,</HI> Rom. 3.
26. <HI>God hath set Christ forth a propitiation through faith,</HI> Rom. 3. 25.
<HI>It is one God which shall justifie the circumcision by faith, and the un∣circumcision
through faith,</HI> Rom. 3. 30. And because it is the instru∣ment
of man in a work of this nature, it is also an instrument of
God. As some have observed a communication of Titles between
Christ and his Church: (the Church being called by his Name,) so
there is a communication of actions in these relative works; <HI>Christ
dwells in our hearts by faith,</HI> Eph. 3. 17. We believe, and not Christ,
and yet faith there is Christs instrument, whereby he takes up his
abode; <HI>God purifies the hearts of the Gentiles by faith,</HI> Acts 15. 17.
They beleeved, and not God, yet faith is Gods instrument in the
work of their purification; so on the other side, the Spirit is Gods
work, yet <HI>we by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the flesh,</HI> Rom. 8. 13.
Man neither justifies nor sanctifies himself, yet by faith he is raised
to close with God in both;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fides percipit justificationem, efficit sanctifi∣cationem.</NOTE> and so Faith as an instrument receives
righteousness to justification, and therefore is called the righteous∣ness
of faith which is our justification, and works sanctification; pro∣vided
you understand not the first work, which is properly rege∣neration,
and precedent to faith, but the farther progresse and in∣crease
of it; <HI>The Spirit working faith,</HI> faith takes in a larger mea∣sure
of the Spirit, <HI>John 7. 37. He that beleeveth on me, as the Scri∣pture
saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water; but this
he spake of the Spirit, which they that beleeve on him, should receive.</HI>
The Spirit will do nothing without our faith, and our faith can
do nothing without the Spirit; Man cannot justifie himselfe by
beleeving without God, and God will not justifie an unbeleeving
man. Faith then is the act of man; man beleeves, yet the instru∣ment
of God, that justifies onely beleevers; so that what is here
spoken by way of exception against faith as an instrument, holds
of efficients, and instruments sole and absolute in their work,
<PB N="109" REF="82"/>
and causality. But where there is a concurrence of agents, and
one makes use of the act of another to produce the effect; that in
such causality is wrought, it will not hold.</P>
<P>The promise or grant of the new Covenant in the Gospel, is (insted
of faith) made the instrument in the work of justification. This is in∣deed
Gods, and not mans. It is the covenant of God, the Promise of
God, the Gospel of God; but of it selfunable to raise man up to justi∣fication.
It is often tendred, and justification not always wrought; &amp;
so disabled from the office of an instrument by <HI>Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ker.</HI> in his Com
upon his first Canon, concerning an instrument.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Quàm pri∣mum ergo in∣strumentum, principali agen¦ti non subser∣vit, instrumen∣ti naturam a mittit.</NOTE> <HI>Assoon as the instru∣ment
servs not the principal agent, so soon it loses the nature of an instru∣ment.</HI>
He instanceth in an horse that obeys not the reins of his rider,
but grows refractory, then he ceaseth to be an instrument for tra∣vel.
A sword is not an instrument of slaughter, where it slays not;
nor an axe an instrument to hew, where it cuts not: neither is the
Gospel an instrument of justification, where it justifies not, &amp; with∣out
our faith, it never justifies. Where the Minister is a Minister of
condemnation, the savour of death to death, there the Gospel be∣comes
an instrument of condemnation and of death. The efficacy
that is in the Gospel for justification, it receives by their faith to
whom it is tendred. <HI>Heb. 4. 2. Vnto us was the Gospel preached as well
as unto them, but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mix∣ed
with faith in them that heard it.</HI> 1 Thes. 2. 2, 13. <HI>You received not
the Word of God (which you heard of us) as the word of men, but (as it is
in truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that be∣leeve.</HI>
So that the Gospel in it self considered, is wanting in that ho∣nour
assigned to an instrument, to have influx to the producing of
the effect of the principal cause by a proper causality; If none dare
say, faith hath such an influx, they may much lesse say, that the
Word hath such an influx. The Gospel is an outward instrument,
saith <HI>Ravanellus,</HI> Faith an inward; They both making up one instru∣ment,
full and compleat, yet Faith is more aptly and fitly called an
instrument, Seeing that faith gives efficacy as an instrument to the
Word, the Word may be without Faith, and so no instrument at all;
but Faith always presupposeth the Word of Promise, &amp; is not with∣out
its object. Therefore to wind up this whole dispute, in which I
have studied to be brief, though I fear some will think I have been
too tedious, Seeing that those that make Faith the instrument in ju∣stification,
make the Gospel an instrument likewise, and dare not
<PB N="130" REF="83"/>
go about to strip it of its honour. I hope that they that make the
Gospel an instrument, will acknowledge Faith to be an instru∣ment
in like manner; being in their efficacy as instruments so inse∣parably
joyned, and so all the controversie may be fairely ended
and concluded.</P>

<P><HI>AGAINST this which hath been said, it is objected by one,
that</HI> Vnbelief is not a barre hindring one,<MILESTONE UNIT="Objections."/> from having part

<HI>Which words how high soever against the Gospel, yet he
undertakes to salve with a distinction. There is a twofold recei∣ving
of Christ, saith he,</HI> (1) There is a passive receiving of Christ,
You will say, (<HI>saith my Authour</HI>) what is passive receiving of
Christ? I answer, (<HI>saith he</HI>) A passive receiving of Christ, is just
such a receiving of him, as when a froward Patient takes a purge, or
some bitter physick▪ he shuts his teeth against it; but the Physician
forceth his mouth open, and poures it downe his throat, and so it works
against his will, by the ever-ruling power of one over him, that knows
it is good for him: Thus I say, there is a passive recipiency
or receiving of Christ, which is the first receiving of him; when
Christ comes by the gift of the Father, to a person whilest he is in the
stubornesse of his own heart. (2) There is an active receiving of
him, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This distinction carries a full contradiction in it self, There can∣not
be in the same subject, a meere passive and active recipie cy of
the same thing, as appeares in the similitude brought to illustrate
it; This froward Patient that hath a medicine forced into him, in
which he is meerly passive, cannot again afterward receive that me∣dicine.
If Christ be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s forced, and enters against our will,
then we cannot actively at any time after receive him, And could

into the rest of heaven, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 1. Then <HI>Christ dwells not in

Then God is not a justifier <HI>of those that beleeve in Jesus,</HI> as <HI>Rom.</HI>
3. 26. but equally justifies men without Faith in Jesus; Then
Christ is not set out <HI>a propitiation through Faith in his blood,</HI> but
without any Faith in it; Then they that beleeve are not only justi∣fied
<HI>from all things from which they could not be justified by the
Law of Moses,</HI> but they that beleeve not. And God gave his
Sonne, that he that beleeves not <HI>on him should have everlasting
life.</HI> This doctrine layes all the honour of Faith in the dust;
Then <HI>Habakkuk</HI> might have spared this speech, <HI>that the just shall
live by Faith,</HI> Habbakuk 2. 4. and <HI>Paul</HI> might have found
another way of life in the flesh than <HI>by Faith in the Son of
God.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> It is said that the justification of a sinner was
with God from eternity; It was in his purpose before all
time to discharge his Elect, and to lay nothing to their
charge; So then this is, as election it selfe, uncon∣ditional.</P>
<P>To which I answer,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> That this ovethrows the redemption
wrought by Christ, and the price paid by his sufferings, as well as
the necessity of Faith; What need Christ to be at all that pains, to
<PB N="132" REF="84"/>
undergo all those sorrows, as to be <HI>a man of sorrows,</HI> to do that
which from all eternity was done? Then, as <HI>Paul</HI> sayes in another
case, <HI>Christ is dead in vain:</HI> This, some have seene, yet rather
than leave their opinion, have chosen to swallow it down, and the
absurdity with it, and do maintaine that Christ did not purchase,
procure, or work any love from God for man, but only published
and declared that he was from eternity beloved; A fit conclusi∣on
drawn from such premisses: Then Christ was no Authour of
eternal salvation, as <HI>Heb.</HI> 5 9. but only the publisher, He was a
messenger from God, in the dayes of his flesh, but no Saviour of
man; He did not redeeme us with a price, but only made known
that we were so farre in the love of God from eternity that no
redemption needs. Secondly, I say, Gods purpose of a thing
doth no put it in being; He takes his own way, to bring about
in time, that which he purposed before all time; All that is done,
even every work under the Sunne, was alike from eternity in the
purpose of God, <HI>Known unto God are all his works from the be∣ginning
of the world,</HI> Acts 15. 18. So the house that was built
this day, was built from eternity; The childe that was born this
day, was borne from eternity; We may as well say that the Elect
were glorified from eternity, so that they need to look after no o∣ther
glorification, as to say they are justified from eternity. All
the works of God were in his purpose from ever, who sees all
things at once; and not as we can comprehend them in their re∣spective
succession? But we enquire after things as they are in
themselves and not as they are in Gods purpose.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Some say justification can be no other, than an act of
God from eternity, being an immanent act, and not a transient.
Transient acts are in time done, in the juncture of time when
God pleases to do them, but immanent acts of God are from e∣ternity.<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/>
To which I first answer, that it is not without danger
for us to bring the actions of God under our examination, and
then to fix School-notions upon them, according to which they
must be bounded, When (as Master <HI>Burges</HI> well observes) <HI>we
are here in meere darknesse, and not able to comprehend how God
is said to act or work.</HI> Treatise of Justification, <HI>page</HI> 166. How
much more safe were it for us to learne <HI>à posteriore,</HI> from the
mouth of God in Scriptures, what his actions are, and the order
how he works, than <HI>à pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI> to conclude that they are thus and
<PB N="133" REF="84"/>
thus, and therefore thus of necessity he must work? Yet if we
may be so bold as to look into this act of his, and take it into
consideration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quae real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m &amp; evidentem mu∣tationem ex∣trinsecus nul∣lam infert. Transiens actio est quae revera mutationem infert.</NOTE> according to this notion; we may farre rather con∣clude
that justification is an action transient, not immanent.
<HI>An immanent action</HI> (as the Schooles tell us) <HI>is terminated
within the subject, and works no real nor evident change out of it:</HI>
and they instance in our conceptions of, and resolutions about
things, <HI>Kek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rman,</HI> p. 107. <HI>A transient act is not terminated within
the subject, but hath its effect, and is terminated upon some other
object.</HI> Now, if by way of analogy we may apply these to God,
for we otherwise can reach none of his actions; it is easie to con∣clude
that justification of a sinner is a transient, and no im∣manent
act; It works man from a state of wrath to a state of
friendship and love, of a vessel of wrath, brings man into favour
and esteeme, which though it work no Physical change in man,
yet the whole effect is terminated in him; That act of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI>
had as real an effect upon <HI>Joseph,</HI> and was terminated in him in his
advancement out of prison, for rule in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as though a Physi∣cian
in case of sicknesse, had wrought a cure upon him. Though
I were not able to hold it our, that justification were a transient
act, but according to our conception of the actions of man, it
should rather appear to be an action immanent in God, so in him
that it had no effect out of him, yet I must follow the Scriptures
that make justification an act in time, not from eternity. <HI>Paul</HI>
having mentioned a state of sinne under which the <HI>Corinthians</HI>
were, saith, <HI>such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are san∣ctified,
but ye are justified,</HI> 1. Corinth. 6. 11. Once they were not,
but now they are in a state of justification; It hath its <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in
which it is acted, a season in which it is vouchsafed. It is affixed
to faith. <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 38. Now faith is not from eternity, it comes
by hearing; A Ministery is continually employed for reconciliation
and pardon of sinne, 1 <HI>Cor. 5. 19. John</HI> 20. Which were in vain
if justification were as election, <HI>from before the foundation of the
world;</HI> They work them not to election, but only call upon them
<HI>to make their calling and election sure;</HI> There are seniors and
juniors in this priviledge, one obtains it before another; <HI>Andro∣nicus
and J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia were in Christ before the Apostle,</HI> Rom. 16. 7.
These evident proofs would take with my faith, above a thousand
such subtilties. But herein the Schools, in their application of
<PB N="134" REF="85"/>
these acts to God, speak according (as to the point in hand) to the
minde of Scriptures.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> It is farther objected that <HI>Christ is the Lamb slaine
from the beginning of the world.</HI> His death hath been of efficacy
in the Church through all ages, <HI>And he bore our sinnes in his body,</HI>
1 Pet. 2. 24. <HI>All our sinnes did meet in him,</HI> Isa. 53. 6. and therefore
from the beginning we were justified.</P>
<P>I answer,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> it profited all those, and only those in each age to
whom it was revealed, and by whom it was applied, and not
those that have no interest in him. Over and above the Decree
of God for mans salvation, there was a necessity of the death of
Christ for our redemption, which Christ in the fulnesse of time
paid on the Crosse. And over and above the death of Christ,
there is a like necessary of the application of it to our soules for
life; The work of redemption was finished on the Crosse, when
Christ <HI>triumphed over principalities and powers.</HI> But much of the
work of our salvation was behinde; Election did not overthrow
Christs redemption, but did establish it; Redemption doth not o∣verthrow
our application, but doth establish it likewise. There
is a farther work of Christs to be done, his intercession in heaven
being one part of his Priest-hood, which he is gone to discharge
as the High Priest into the holiest of holies; A farther work to be
done by man through believing. Not to have interest in Christs
death, is all one as though he had not died; He that beleeves in
him shall not perish. See <HI>Baxter of Justification, Aphorisme 15.
Davenant de morte Christi, cap. 5. p. 58, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly, it is said by another,</HI> If Faith be a condition of the Co∣venant
of Grace,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> then it can be no instrument of our justification;
If it be a condition in this Covenant, it justifies as a condition, and
then it cannot justifie as an instrument, and so I pul down what I build,
and run upon contradictions.</P>
<P>I answer,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I should rather judge on the contrary, that because
it is a condition of the covenant, in the way as it is before exprest,
that it is therefore an instrument in our justification; God tenders
the gift of righteousnesse to be received by Faith. He covenants
for this Faith, for acceptation of this righteousnesse. By beleeving
then we keep covenant, and receive Christ for justification, We as
well do what God requires, as receive what he tenders;
We do our duty, and take Gods gift, and thereby keep covenant,
<PB N="135" REF="85"/>
and receive life, and so Faith is both a condition and an instru∣ment.</P>
<P>Here I might by way of just corollary infer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A justified man is fitted for e∣very duty, to which God is pleased for to call.</NOTE> that a justified man
reconciled to God in Christ, is a man fitted for every duty unto
which God calls, which he is pleased to require; Faith is his ju∣stification,
the instrumental work of his reconciliation to God;
and all things are possible to him that beleeveth, <HI>Mark</HI> 9. 23.
There is not a duty commanded, but a beleeving man through
Christ is strengthned for it; <HI>The Word works effectually in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se
that believe,</HI> as 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. 13. We see the great works that were
atchieved by those of ancient time, both in doing and suffering,
<HI>Heb.</HI> 11. and all of those are ascribed to Faith, what Christ can
do as in reference to duty, that they can do to acceptation; <HI>They
can do all things through Christ that strengthens them,</HI> Phil. 4. 13.
Christ <HI>overcomes the world,</HI> John 16 33. <HI>And this is their victory
whereby they overcome the world,</HI> 1 John 5. 4. <HI>Christ treads down
Satan,</HI> Rom. 16 20. <HI>And they resist him strong in the Faith,</HI>
1 Pet. 5. 9. A man of Faith is for universal obedience; He is a
man for dependance on God for the fruition of all promises. A
word from God is enough for Faith. He knows how to rest upon
him, for the good things of the earth, he is above anxious
thoughts, <HI>what he should eate, what he should drink, or where∣with
he should he clothed,</HI> knowing that <HI>godlinesse hath the promise
of this life,</HI> 1 Tim. 4. 8. and therefore, <HI>Though the fig-tree shall
not blossome, neither shall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the
Olive shall faile, and the fields shall yeeld no meat, the flock shall
be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no heard in the stalls,
yet he will rejoyce in the Lord, he will joy in the God of his salvation,</HI>
Hab 3. 17, 18. he knows how to rest upon him for spiritual
priviledges, for adoption of sonnes, for evelasting salvation; He
rests upon this, that <HI>he that liveth and beleeveth in Christ shall not
die for ever.</HI> He knows how to manage all states and conditions,
he <HI>knows how to be full, and how to be hungry;</HI> he can beare pro∣sperity,
and not be puffed up; He can be under adversity, and not
be cast down; In the worst of times, the just lives by faith, <HI>Hab.</HI>
2. 4. He can make use of every Ordinance for his spiritual advan∣tage.
The word preach is for his benefit, <HI>Being mixt with faith when
he receives it,</HI> Heb. 4▪ 2. He knows how to improve the Sacra∣ments
for his spiritual growth, those <HI>seales of the righteousnesse of
<PB N="136" REF="86"/>
Faith,</HI> Rom. 4. 11. <HI>Abel</HI> by Faith exceeded <HI>Cain</HI> in sacrifices,
<HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 4. and so do these exceed all unbeleevers in their perfor∣mances.
All of these might be farther and more fully enlarged,
but that it is done at large by better hands; Master <HI>Ward</HI> in his

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Repentance is a condition of the Covenant of grace.</HEAD>
<P>THe condition immediately serviceable for mans reconciliati∣on
to God, we have seen; that which respects his reparation
in his qualifications, to hold up communion with God, follows,
which is, Repentance. The end of Christs coming in the flesh be∣ing
to save sinners: He saves them not in their sins; but from their
sins; and therefore calls them to repentance, and engages all to
it, that he receives into covenant. As God will have a self-outed,
and beleeving people, So, he will have an humble and an holy peo∣ple.
So <HI>John Baptist</HI> the forerunner of the Mediatour, began his
Ministery, <HI>Repent,</HI> giving in this, as his reason, <HI>The Kingdome
of heaven is at hand,</HI> that is, a New Testament-state, in which the
covenant of Grace was to be opened, and the glorious privi∣ledges
of it made manifest, <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 2. With the self-same
words, Jesus, the Mediatour of the covenant, begins his Mini∣stery,
<HI>Matth. 4. 12, 17. verses</HI> compared. <HI>From that time
Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the Kingdome of
Heaven is at hand.</HI> To this he resolves to engage those that he
receives. So it was with the twelve, that were men employed
to bring Nations into covenant. They thus began their Mini∣stery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith and Re∣pentance are distinct graces, and not one and the same.</NOTE>
<HI>Mark 6. 12. They went out, and preached that men should
repent.</HI> Neither let any make these two (Faith and Repentance,
or Faith and Obedience, which is comprised under Repent∣ance)
one and the same, and old project to introduce ju∣stification
by works. The Scriptures evidently distinguish
them, <HI>Paul</HI> makes them two distinct heads in the Ministery, when
he preached either to the Jews or Gentiles, <HI>Acts 20. 21. Testify∣ing
<PB N="137" REF="86"/>
both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks repentance towards God,
and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> They are two distinct heads,
of Catechisme in the Apostles times, <HI>Repentance from dead works,
and Faith towards God,</HI> Heb. 6. <HI>Repent ye, and beleeve the Gospel,</HI>
Mark 1. 15. There are those acts in Scripture attributed to Faith,
that will by no means be ascribed to love or obedience, as the ta∣king
in of the priviledges before mentioned. If <HI>Faith work by
love,</HI> as the Apostle speaks, <HI>Gal. 5. 6. And love be the end of the
commandment, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and
faith unfeigned,</HI> 1 Tim. 1. 5. then faith is a distinct thing from love.
If by Faith the Worthies of old <HI>wrought righteousnesse,</HI> then righ∣teousnesse
may be distinguished from it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 33. As Faith
and Hope make two Graces, so Love a third, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 13. It is
not the Gospel way to confound them together, They must not
be divided, but they are to be distinguished. In this of repentance
which is a Gospel-grace and condition of the covenant, we may
observe
<LIST>
<ITEM>First, A necessary pre-requisite to it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, The essential parts of it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>A necessary pre-requisite to this of repentance (as to the other
of Faith) is Conviction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godly sorrow is a prerequisite to repentance.</NOTE> Compunction, Remorse, Unto which
the name of repentance is often given, though it be of farre more
narrow comprehension than the whole work; yea, it reacheth
not unto any thing which is of the essence of it, Called repent∣ance
(as some say) by a <HI>Synechdoche,</HI> the part for the whole; but I
rather take it to be a <HI>Metonimy;</HI> Sorrow is rather an adjunct
than a part of it, yet such an adjunct that still accompanies it, and
makes way for it, as the needle (as the Ancients use to expresse
it) enters the cloth, not to stay, but to let in the thread. An Of∣ficer
enters an house, to throw out one inhabitant, and to let in
another, but not to stay himself. It hath its name from paine,
grief, or trouble, which affects the soul for sin, which must needs
follow, when once we look upon it with shame and wearisomnesse.
Who can imagine a man to have his eyes opened, to see that
through his whole life, he hath risen up in hostility, and oppositi∣on
against God? hath taken off that stamp, which God in crea∣tion
put upon him? run his soul upon everlasting hazard, and
all of this without sense of shame, fear, or trouble? Who can ima∣gine
<PB N="138" REF="87"/>
that the soul can leave so ugly a path, as that of sin formerly
so pleasant, and desired, without any grief or trouble of minde
that he hath so long held it? Or that any will make out for help
in a Saviour, till they see themselves through sinne in a lost and
undone condition? I speak not of infants (who neither act faith
nor repentance) but of those of growth, whom God works for
himself by his Ministers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some degree of soul-shaking by the Law ne∣cessary.</NOTE> As they have their call by the Word,
So the Word hath its efficacy in some measure of soul-shaking, by
the Lawes discovery, by <HI>which is the knowledge of sinne,</HI> as <HI>Rom.</HI>
3. 20. Evangelical allurements (on which by some the whole of
the work is laid) can never (I suppose) work on the soule with∣out
Law-convictions. If these Gospel allurements draw to
Christ, they must draw from sinne, and how shall any be drawn
from what he does not know; nor ever understood either to
be evil, or dangerous? It is with me no lesse a Paradox,
that a man may be drawn from sin, without the discovery of the
Law, as to be drawn to Christ without the light of the Gospel,
And to say the Gospel discovers sin, as well as the Law; taking the
Gospel in opposition to the moral precepts, (as here it must be
taken) is the greatest absurdity. <HI>Exem. gr.</HI> If it be questioned
whether to take up armes be a sin? whether to fight a duel be a
sinne? whether usury be sin? or to marry within the Levitical
degrees forbidden be sin, shall I determine this out of a Gospel-promise?
<HI>That Jesus Christ came to save sinners. That the blood
of Christ takes away all sin. That in him all that beleeve are justified.</HI>
A thousand of these will contribute nothing to the expediting of
these or like questions; or the conviction of any under guilt;
The work must be brought to the rule, the action to the line for
discovery; Upon the Laws convictions there may follow Gospel-aggravations;
But conviction is the work of the Law, as an in∣strument
of the Spirit. This conviction unto change is hardly
without compunction, remorse, and terrours in the soul. It was
not the single case of the Corinthians, but common with other
Christians, as the natural work of godly sorrow, <HI>that it worketh re∣pentance
not to be repented of,</HI> 2 Cor. 7. 10. I will not stand to di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
whether any, ever are exempted from this preparatory work.
I question not Gods prerogative, I am upon enquiry after his
usual method. I know some instance in <HI>Matthew,</HI> who being called,
suddenly, followed Christ, and we heare nothing of any work
<PB N="139" REF="87"/>
upon his spirit to trouble; But who knows whether <HI>Matthew,</HI> a
Jew, were not called by grace, before this call to an Apostleship?
and if not in grace, whether it necessarily followed in that instant?
The like is objected of <HI>Lydia, The Lord opened her heart, that
she attended to the things that were spoken of</HI> Paul, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 14.
without any sorrow or trouble in spirit is mentioned; Nei∣ther
is there mention of any joy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limits put to this doctrine of godly sor∣row.</NOTE> or rejoycing in spirit, and she
by many is believed also to have been a Proselyte. Yet this of godly
sorrow, must be understood with some limit.</P>
<P>1. An equal degree of sorrow, and preparative work, is not ne∣cessary
in all; One mans terrours and heart-breakings, are no ne∣cessary
precedent, for all others to reach.</P>
<P>2. An high degree is not necessarily required of any; God can
come sooner in, with Gospel-cordials, after Law-convictions, unto
one than another.</P>
<P>3. No man hath reason to quarrel his conversion; because his
sorrow hath not been like some others; each man hath not like
paine in cure of a like malady.</P>
<P>4. None should beg of God overwhelming and amazing sha∣kings;
and humiliations of Spirit, God better knows their frame
than they understand themselves.</P>
<P>5. None can judge of the truth of their repentance by the
greatnesse of their trouble; It may possibly end in horrour and
work nothing better than it self; It may only have its present work
to cast hell in the face, and then the person returne to his old
byasse, to his sinful pleasures, his worldly advantages, as <HI>Saul</HI>
to his Musick, <HI>Cain</HI> to his building of Cities; yet when God thus
plowes, it is a hopeful signe he intends sowing, and men in this
case must not reason themselves to be such soyle, on whom no
good can be done, as though they were past all husbandry of the
Lord, He can take away a heart of stone, and turne a rock into
a fruitful field. This is Gods method, do not dispute, but believe.</P>
<P>6. Then it is in a degree sufficient, when it effects the work for
which it serves; when it brings the soul out of love with sin, takes
it out of the paths of sinne, when it so works to an apprehension
of dangers, that it works the soul to cast it self on Christ Jesus.
When horrours work desires; not of ease, but of grace, of Christ
and of whole Christ, of pardon of sin, and power against sin, there
is a true work.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="88"/>
For the essential parts of this grace, which I make a Gospel-engagement
and condition of the covenant, they are privative,
or positive. Privative, is the destruction of what hath been. Po∣sitive
is the introduction of what is not. Every change hath two
termes. The one is <HI>terminus ad quem;</HI> which is endeavoured.
The other is <HI>terminus à quo,</HI> which is left; and so in this change
which grace works,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The essentials in repentance are, 1. Privative Cessation from sinne.</NOTE> and to which the covenant of grace doth en∣gage.
The privative part which we are to leave, is, sin, the work
of Satan. The positive part which we are to endeavour, is that
which stands in full opposition; Forsaking of sin, we must follow
after righteousnesse, and turning from Satan, we must turne to
God; and therefore the Ministery which findes men out of co∣venant,
and works them into it, is to bring them from darknesse
to light, from the power of Satan to God, <HI>Acts</HI> 26. 18. The
privative part is frequently enjoyned, as that which bindes at all
times, and to all times. A man in covenant with God, is to have
no more to do with sin; <HI>Cease to do evil, put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes,</HI> Isa. 1. 16. <HI>Be ye separate, touch no
unclean thing,</HI> 2 Cor. 6. 17. <HI>Mortifie therefore your members which
are upon the earth, fornication, uncleannesse, inordinate affection,
evil concupiscence, and covetousnesse, which is idolatry; for which
things sake, the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobe∣dience.
In the which ye also walked sometimes when ye lived in
them, But now you also put off all these, anger, wrath, malice, blas∣phemy,
filthy communication out of your mouth; lie not one to another,
seeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds,</HI> Col. 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Old things with Christians are to be done away; This is the
duty of all those that pretend to Christ; <HI>Let every one that na∣meth
the Name of Christ depart from iniquity,</HI> 2 Tim. 2. 19. All that
is in Christ, is wholly against it; His Prophetick office leads us
from it, and gives us light to avoid it; In his Kingly office, his Law
is against it; and his Priestly office is to redeem from it. They
that are in Christ, and learn him as the truth is in Christ Jesus,
attaine to it, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. 22. That ye put off <HI>concerning the former
conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceit∣ful
lusts.</HI> It is the character of a man in Christ, <HI>Gal. 5. 24.
They that are Christs, have crucified the flesh with the affecti∣ons
and lusts.</HI> And this upon peril of bearing their sinne, <HI>Ezek.
18. 30, 31. Repent and turne your selves from all your transgressions,
<PB N="141" REF="88"/>
so iniquity shall not be your ruine: Cast away from you all your trans∣gressions,
whereby you have transgressed, and make you a new heart
and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</HI> No man
in sinne is for glory, 1 <HI>Cor. 6. 9. Know ye not that the unrighteous
shall not inherit the kingdom of God? The works of the flesh are manifest,
which are these, adultery, fornication, uncleannesse, lasciviousnesse, ido∣latry,
witchcraft, hatred, varience, emulation, wrath, strife, se∣ditions,
heresies, envyings, murders, drunkennesse, revellings and
such like, of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the Kingdome of
God,</HI> Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Upon these termes it is that they obtaine
pardon of sinne, <HI>Isa. 55. 7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him returne unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundant∣ly
pardon.</HI> Grace is no where more freely tendred than there:
<HI>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath
no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without
money, and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that
which is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not;
hearken diligently unto me, and eat you that which is good, and let
your soul delight it self in fastnesse. Incline your ear, and come unto
me; hear and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting Co∣venant
with you, even the sure mercies of</HI> David, <HI>verse</HI> 1, 2, 3. And
yet we see upon what termes it is tendered. That which keeps
from us the mercies, and brings upon us the curses of the cove∣nant,
is upon covenant-condition, to be shunned; This is true
of all covenants made where any good is hoped, and evil feared.
That sinne against God keeps us from the mercies, and brings upon
us the curses of the covenant, is clear in what hath been spoke:
<HI>What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou should'st take
my covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hast instruction, and cast∣est
my words behinde thee?</HI> Psal. 50. 16, 17. A people that keep
to their termes of covenant, are in communion with God; but
sinne separates between a people and God; that is the ground
of quarrel, <HI>Hos.</HI> 4. 1. between earth, and heaven. Men entring
and keeping covenant with God, are of God, and not of the
Devil; They are turned from the Devil to God, from fellowship
with <HI>Belial,</HI> to fellowship with God; <HI>But he that committeth sin,
is of the Devil,</HI> 1 John 3. 8. Christ that carries on the covenant
<PB N="142" REF="89"/>
(as you have heard) will never cast off those that walk up to the
termes of the covenant; but he casts off, with a dreadful sentence
all those that work iniquity; <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 23. As for those Anti∣nomian
spirits, and ranting wretches, that do contend that sinne
is no barre to their communion with God; <HI>That God is as well
pleased with man in the greatest heighth of sinne, as the most holy
duties; That this doctrine charges a change upon God, to be now
pleased, and presently in wrath and displeasure;</HI> they do but deceive
themselves, and make it their work to deceive others. They nei∣ther
know sin, nor the direful guilt of it, nor yet God, nor his
direful displeasure against it. The Apostle makes it his businesse
to undeceive them, as <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5. 6. having reckoned up a catalogue
of sins, he thus speaks; <HI>Be not deceived with vaine words, for because
of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedi∣ence.</HI>
Neither is there any change (according to this doctrine) sup∣posed
in God. The change is in them that covenant against it, and
walk in it. Did they know the terrour of it, they would tremble
at the thought of running upon it, and by heaping up sin <HI>to trea∣sure
up wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous
judgements of God,</HI> Rom. 2. 5. They will finde this an aggregate of
all miseries, and let them take beed that they call not to the rocks
and mountains to hide them from it.</P>
<P>The Positive part is to be followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Positive. A returne to God, and an holy walking with him.</NOTE> as the Privative part to
be shunned. As <HI>Timothy</HI> must <HI>flee covetousnesse,</HI> so he must <HI>follow
after righteousnesse, godlinesse, faith, love, patience, meeknesse,</HI>
1 Tim. 6. 11. Faith in the former place as an instrument service∣able
for our accesse to God, makes up (as we heard) a conditi∣on
of it self, As a work or inherent grace, it is here comprised in
this covenant-condition, together with others, to hold up our
communion with God. <HI>As we must cease to do evil, so we must
learne to do well; As we must put off the old man with his deeds, so we
must put on the new man.</HI> It is not enough, not to bring evil fruit,
wilde grapes; but we must be <HI>fruitful in every good work.</HI> God
hath a quarrel with his people upon a charge of negatives, as well
as affirmatives, omissions, as well as commissions. <HI>She obeyed
not the voice, she received not correction, she trusted not in the Lord,
she drew not neer to her God,</HI> Zeph. 3. 2. We must not alone, be
free, from that charge of Christ upon the Jews, <HI>of doing the work
of the Devil,</HI> John 8. 44. but we <HI>must abound in the work of the
<PB N="143" REF="89"/>
Lord,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 58. And this upon the penalty mentioned in
the former branch; <HI>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit,
shall be hewen down and cast into the fire,</HI> Matth. 3. 10. Upon these
termes it is, that we avoid the curse of the covenant. Those
on whom no condemnation is charged, <HI>walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit; and the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meeknesse, temperance,</HI>
Gal. 5. 21, 22. Upon those termes, salvation, the mercy of the
covenant is obtained, <HI>Christ is the Authour of everlasting salva∣tion
to them that obey him,</HI> Heb. 5. 9. When the Apostle makes light
of outward priviledges, he puts the whole stresse upon mans faith
and obedience, Gal. 5. 6. <HI>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision a∣vaileth
any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by
love. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
keeping of the Commandments of God,</HI> 1. Cor. 7. 19. That which is so
mightily available with God in covenant, is the walking up to the
terms and observance of the conditions of the covenant; But faith
and the keeping of the Commandments of God, are as we see) thus
available and prevalent. These two are distinguished, but never
severed. That faith which looks at Christs blood as a Saviour, ac∣cepts
him as a Sovereign, and the latter about which there is most
dispute, is an evidence to conclude the former; <HI>Hereby we know
that we know him, if we keep his Commandments,</HI> where knowledge
is put for faith, as appears in the context, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2. 3. These are
heard of God in prayer, <HI>Joh. 9. 32. If any man be a worshipper of God,
and doth his will, him he heareth. Whatsoever we aske, we receive of
him, because we keep his Commandment, and do those things that are
pleasing in his sight,</HI> 1 John 3. 22. These are sealed of God by his
Spirit, 1 <HI>John 3. 24. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth
in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
Spirit which he hath given us.</HI> These great mercies are for men in
covenant, that keep covenant: <HI>But the mercy of the Lord is from
everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteous∣nesse
unto childrens children. To such as keep his Covenant, and to those
that remember his commandments to do them,</HI> Ps. 103. 17, 18.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Objections against the conditionality of Repentance answered.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HEre Objections must be removed;</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>First, joyntly against faith
and repentance, some making challenge of both as no cove∣nant-conditions.
So Mr.</HI> Baxters questionist, How do you make faith
and repentance, to be conditions of the Covenant on our part, seeing the
bestowing of them, is part of the condition on Gods part; can they be our
conditions and Gods too?</P>
<P>In case these two cannot stand together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Objection retorted.</NOTE> that they should be
conditions both Gods and ours; we may answer by way of re∣tortion,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/>
and I am sure we have the better end of the staffe, that
they are our conditions; They are conditions on our part, and
therefore they cannot be Gods: That they are ours, is made known
of God, as by the beame of the Sun in his Word. And I shall not
stand to distinguish of an absolute and conditional covenant, that
so making the whole in the absolute covenant to be Gods, and in
the conditional covenant, this part to be ours, which I know not
whether exactly understood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith and re∣pentance are our conditi∣ons, not Gods.</NOTE> the Scripture will beare, but in plaine
terms deny that they are Gods conditions, and affirm them to be
ours. I know what God speaks in his Word concerning these works;
<HI>That he will write his Law in our hearts, and put it into our inward
parts; That he will take away the heart of stone, and give an heart of
flesh;</HI> which implies this work of which we speak. I know likewise
what in particular is affirmed of Christ, that <HI>he is the authour and
finisher of our faith,</HI> Heb. 12. 2. <HI>that he gives repentance,</HI> Acts 5. 31.
<HI>that God grants to the Gentiles repentance to life,</HI> Acts 11. 18. And
I have not forgot what I have said before of the concurrence of
grace in the performance of every Gospel-work; Yet all this rises
not up hither to make them formally Gods act, &amp; not ours. Whose
acts they be, his conditions they are; this is evident: But they are
our acts. We beleeve, We repent, It is not God that believes; It is
not God that repents: That is an absurdity which <HI>Arminians</HI> have
laboured to charge upon us, to render that which we hold of the
necessity of the concurrence of grace in these works odious; But it is
that which the Orthodox party have still disclaimed. The Apostle
calls upon the <HI>Philippians,</HI> Phil. 2. 12. <HI>To work out their own sal∣vation;</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="90"/>
the work is their own, as the salvation. They are a Be∣leevers
own act, and not barely a spontaneous act, (on which he
is carried, as a Bird in preparing a nest for her young, and Bees
in preparing honey for their subsistence, in which Phylosophy
tells us, that they aime at no end) but they are voluntary actions
of choice, done out of choice, aiming at salvation as his end. The
mercy in the Covenant being on these termes tendred, <HI>With the
heart man beleeveth unto righteousnesse,</HI> Rom. 10. 10. <HI>The just
lives by his faith,</HI> Hab. 2. 4. <HI>They to turne to the Lord with all
their heart,</HI> Joel 2. 13. <HI>They obey from the heart the form of Do∣ctrine
whereunto they are delivered,</HI> Rom. 6. 17. <HI>They do the will
of God from the heart,</HI> Ephes. 6. 6. Faith and Repentance are
mans work, which man in covenant does, respective to salva∣tion,
in the covenant tendered,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> not Gods. But the Apostle, some
may say, in the next words tells us, <HI>that it is God that works the
will and the deed,</HI> vers. 13. There he seems to take them from us,
and ascribe the formality of them to God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> In this co-operation
of God, whether they be formally our works, or Gods, let <HI>Esay</HI>
determine, <HI>Isa. 26. 12. Thou hast wrought all our works in us;</HI>
When God hath wrought it, the work is ours, we have the re∣ward
of it, and we shall beare our sinne in case it be neglected,
and let the Apostle explaine himselfe, <HI>Ephes. 2. 10. We are his
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</HI> God hath or∣dained
good works as a Christians way and walk.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Via ad regnum non causa reg∣nandi.</NOTE> They are
charged upon man as is plain in the context, in order to salvation;
They are the way that we hold in our passage on to that salva∣tion
which God of grace vouchsafes; and we are Gods work∣manship
created in Christ Jesus for these ends. Our dexterity in
holy duties,is from the frame into which grace put us; So still
the work is ours, though power for action is vouchsafed of God,
And the conditions are ours, for discharge of which we have yet di∣vine
assistance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments e∣vincing that Faith and Re∣pentance are our conditions, and not Gods, in the proper conditional covenant.</NOTE> That faith and repentance are our conditions, and
not Gods, take these arguments.</P>
<P>1. Those conditions that are not mentioned in the proper con∣ditional
covenant, as from God, but required of God, from us,
are not Gods conditions, but ours, in that Covenant. This is
cleare; Being there expresly required of us, and not so much as
mentioned, as from God; they cannot be his engagement, but
<PB N="146" REF="91"/>
ours to performe. But Faith and Repentance are not mentioned
as from God, in the proper conditional covenant, but required of
God from us. Therefore Faith, and Repentance are not
Gods conditions in the proper conditionall Covenant, but
ours.</P>
<P>2. The conditions of a covenant are his that performeth, and
not his that imposeth. This proposition is cleare in reason, and
confessed by the adversary. But we perform, and God imposeth
Faith and Repentance. They are therefore our conditions, and
not Gods, in this covenant.</P>
<P>3. Covenant-conditions are theirs, that are charg'd with
falshood in case of failing in them, and non-performance of them.
This is plaine in all covenants: To make conditions, and to
faile in them, is to be false to them. But in case of failing in
Faith and Repentance, man is charged, and not God. God fails
not, but man deals falsly. Therefore, they are mans conditions,
and not Gods.</P>
<P>4. Covenant-conditions are theirs, who upon failing in them,
and not performance of them, suffer as covenant-breakers. This
is clear, <HI>Israel</HI> covenanted to dismisse their Hebrew servants, and
dismissed them not, and <HI>Israel</HI> suffered for it, <HI>Jer.</HI> 34. But upon
failing in Faith and Repentance, God suffers not, so much as in
his Name, as a covenant-breaker. He is not charged with mens
unbelief and impenitence: Men themselves suffer. Therefore Faith
and Repentance are mans conditions, not Gods.</P>
<P>2. There are objections peculiarly against repentance, as it
comprises the whole frame of obedience,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> as before held forth to
disable it from being any Gospel-condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what man∣ner Works are called for in the Covenant of Grace.</NOTE></P>
<P>By this means the covenant of Grace will be (<HI>say some</HI>) a cove∣nant
of works; Repentance in this latitude (to which we have spo∣ken)
containes the whole of obedience, and being made a condition of the
Covenant of Grace, Works are introduced, and a Covenant of Works
re-established.</P>
<P>As there was grace in the first covenant,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> as you have heard,
which we call a covenant of Works; So works are not wholly
excluded from this covenant, which we call a covenant of
Grace. God still keeps up his Sovereignty, as you have heard,
and how this can be done when he leaves man, at that wilde free∣dome,
not so much as to call for homage from him, cannot be
<PB N="147" REF="91"/>
conceived, his rule even in this covenant, is to reward men <HI>ac∣cording
to their works. Behold I come quickly, and my reward it
with me; to give every man according as his work shall be,</HI> Rev. 22.
12. Works then are not excluded from this covenant; yea, Christ
the Mediatour of the covenant aforehand tells us, <HI>Except our
righteousnesse exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees,
ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdome of heaven,</HI> Matth. 5. 20.
They had their righteousnesse, and (as was supposed) they made
a great progresse in the way of righteousnesse; yet we must
have an exceeding righteousnesse, above that which they
taught, and practised, or else there is no salvation in this cove∣nant.
These two covenants notwithstanding remaine distinct,
and not confounded together. There is a legal righteousnesse;
such as the Law in the highest extremity of it requires, without the
least indulgence in case of failing; This the covenant of Works
calls for, and in this we fall short; but Christ answers, and there∣fore
He <HI>is the end of the Law for righteousnesse,</HI> Rom. 10. 3. <HI>and by
this,</HI> we are saved. There is a righteousnesse of the Gospel which
God in covenant calls for, to which it is his Spirit enables, <HI>and in this</HI>
we are saved.</P>
<P>2. Gospel-obedience is called for in the Covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Repentance necessarily flowing from Faith, is not thereby disab∣led from being a condition in the Covenant of Grace.</NOTE> but not as any
condition of the Covenant; Faith is the alone condition, obedience ne∣cessarily flows from it, and follows upon it when once we believe; it need
not to be conditioned, or indented for; seeing when we are in Christ by
faith, we can then do no other than obey.</P>
<P>I answer. This position here laid down, <HI>that obedience neces∣sarily
follows, and flows from Faith,</HI> is a position indeed main∣tained
by the reformed Churches against <HI>Papists, Arminians,
Socinians,</HI> and other opposites of it, from which position of
ours, they inferre as by necessary consequence that all commands,
requiring obedience, are then needlesse, and all exhortations,
reproofs, motives and promises to no purpose. None either com∣mands
or perswades the Heavens to move, the Sunne to give
light, the Fire to give heat, or the water to give moisture; That
which necessarily works is let alone to work, and to take its course
in working. And this Objection (taking away this Gospel-con∣dition
on this ground) is of the same stamp; Obedience neces∣sarily
flowing from Faith, includes Gospel-commands, exhorta∣tions,
reproofs, as well as Gospel-conditions. If God need
<PB N="148" REF="92"/>
not, to condition, and engage for obedience, from Beleevers,
because they thus necessarily obey, then he needs not give com∣mands,
or presse obedience for the same reason, when yet the
Gospel is full of exhortations, commands, menaces, promises, with
application to Beleevers, to men professing Faith, to men in Christ
by Faith.</P>
<P>For satisfaction then of this Popish-Arminian objection, we
must distinguish of consequents which necessarily flow from
their principles. Some are natural, which of themselves have
their effects, as those in the objection mentioned; Here is
neither command imposed, condition required, nor promise held
forth: They are not in any capacity of acting or working o∣therwise
than they do. Others are moral, who work not by
way of Physical necessity, but are kept in their way by the power
of grace upholding; which does not exclude, but necessarily takes
in mans endeavour in the use of meanes, to yeeld obedience, and to
hold on, in all patience and perseverance. This argument follow∣ed
home will be of equal force, against Faith (as a condition) as,
against sincerity; seeing Gods Elect shall beleeve, as they that be∣leeve
shall yeeld obedience. There is a like necessity of faith, flow∣ing
from election, as there is of obedience, to flow from Faith,
as Faith therefore, so obedience, either of both in their places are
covenant-conditions.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What degree of obedience the Covenant of grace calls

<P>HEre is seasonably moved, and is not without some difficulty
answered; what degree of obedience, this new covenant
calls for from us, that so we may endeavor it, and understand
our selves when we have by grace attained to it, that having entred
covenant with God, we may not be found of those that have
wickedly departed; and dealt falsely in the covenant. In this
there are several opinions, which are to come under exami∣nation.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="92"/>
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perfection of degrees is not so called for of God in Cove∣nant, that upon failing it, the mercies promi∣sed in Cove∣nant are lost.</NOTE> some say that it is required of Christians in an exact way,
in a full perfection, as, of parts, so of degrees, answering to the
perfection of the Law, as written in the heart, and given on Mount
<HI>Sinai;</HI> And so required that obedience in a more low degree, will
not be accepted, or the mercies promised in the covenant ob∣tained;
which doctrine of theirs (rigidly followed) stands <HI>as
that two edged sword,</HI> Gen. 3. 24. keeping the way of the tree of Life,
and making the way to salvation unpassable. Thus the Councel
of <HI>Trent,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Si quis dixerit, baptizatos per ba∣ptisimum ipsum solius tantùm debitores fidei fieri, non autem universa legis Christi servandae; anathema fit. <HI>Sess. Sept. Canon. Sex.</HI></NOTE> <HI>If any man shall say, that by Ba∣ptisme,

so, as that to do things against the Law were no sinne, as though
the Law were abrogated.</HI> This he confesses Protestants do not
say, and in that, he saith <HI>there is no controversie,</HI> or else so, that
<HI>justification or salvation doth not depend on the fulfilling of the
Law, but only on the mercy of God by faith applied,</HI> this he
makes the Protestants errour, and so brings in justification by
the Law, and utterly confounds the covenant of works and grace
together, onely I confesse the businesse seemes much mollified by
the explanations, that they give of those words, <HI>fulfilling of the
Law.</HI> First, curtelling the Law, in taking off, the first <HI>fomes,</HI>
and motions of actual sinne, yea even all that goes before con∣sent
<PB N="150" REF="93"/>
of will, making it no sinne at all, as also multitudes of actions,
some of them foule enough, as not within this verge, such, which
they call by the name of venial sinnes, which are besides the Law,
but not against it, bending, (as some merrily speak) but not
breaking the Commandments, though they would never give us
a catalogue of sins, mortal, or venial, nor any certaine mark or
character, whereby they might be distinguished. All these are
pared off, as no breaches of the Law, nor (in their own nature)
deserving, the sentence of eternal death, and the temporal pu∣nishments
due to them after death is holpen out, by their Indul∣gences.
Secondly so helping themselves out with distinctions, at
least some among them, that keeping the Law with them is no o∣ther
than the grace of sanctification, in the very sense as the
Orthodox hold it forth; He that pleases may read what <HI>Jansenius</HI>
hath, <HI>chap.</HI> 81. of his Harmony, Opposing <HI>Luther</HI> for his denial,
<HI>that the first and great Commandment in the Law in this life can
be fulfilled;</HI> and charging it with blasphemy, <HI>Luther</HI> having <HI>Au∣stins</HI>
authority in several places, (as <HI>Jansenius</HI> confesses) for to se∣cond
him (affirming with him, that this <HI>Commandment in this life
cannot be perfected or fulfilled, but it is to be fulfilled in the life to
come,</HI> giving his reason<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Nam cum est aliquid carnalis concupiscentiae quod vel conti∣nendo foenetur, nam omninò ex tota anima diligitur Deus.</NOTE> <HI>As long as there is any thing of carnal
concupiscence to be restrained, God is not with the whole heart loved.</HI>)
The good Bishop knows how by distinction, to salve <HI>Au∣stin,</HI>
and maintaine his doctrine to be good divinity, and de∣nying
<HI>Luther</HI> that favour, to leave him under the brand of
blasphemy, so that the result of all with him,
is this,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Diligitur tunc Deus ex toto corde; cum quis ex intima &amp; sincera erga Deum affectione occupatur potissimùm in his quae Dei sunt, prae omnibus illi placere studens, ac sollicitus ut non tantum quae∣dam Dei mandata perficiat, sed cuncta idque non seniter &amp; ex tristi animo, sed gnaviter &amp; hilariter, dolens ex animo si quid vel ab alliis vel à se per carnis infirmitatem admittatur contrium divi∣nae voluntati. <HI>Jansenii Harmon. c.</HI> 81.</NOTE> <HI>God is then loved with the whole heart,
when any one, out of inward and sincere
affection to God, is principally exercised in those
things which are of God; studying above all
things to please him, and carefully to observe
not one, but all his Commandments, and that
not slothfully, and against heart, but diligently,
and cheerfully, grieving from the heart if any
thing by others or himself through infirmity of
the flesh be admitted contrary to the will of God.</HI>
So that some might think, all controversie in this point, may
cease; and that the difference between us, were no more than a
strife of words, seeing we do not only confesse that this ought
<PB N="151" REF="93"/>
to be done, but also urge a necessity of doing of it, and they say
the Law is fulfilled when it is done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law a rule of our du∣ty, not of our strength.</NOTE> But here, 1. Much wrong is
done to the Law (as though it were a rule of our strength, not of
our duty, that it answered, and might be applied to each mans
impaired strength, and weakened abilities, or that the Gospel-grace
of godly sorrow for sin against the Law, were the keeping
of the Law, making repentance a satisfactory discharge, for dis∣obedience;
When these men cannot bring up mans nature to the
streight line of the Law, they bring down the Law to the crooked
nature of man. 2. It is injurious to man, puffing him up with
conceit of answering the Law, setting him up as high as he should
be laid low, ready to say with the young man in the Gospel, <HI>All
these have I kept from my youth,</HI> when holding out the Law in its
just latitude, (as it was happily brought home to the Apostles
conscience) sin would revive, and he would see himselfe in a lost
condition.</P>
<P>A second opinion is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of Grace doth not cal for per∣fection, and ac∣cept sincerity.</NOTE> that the covenant of grace requires per∣fection
in the exactest way, without help of these mens distincti∣ons
in an equal degree with the covenant of works, but with
this difference; In the covenant of works there is no indulgence
or dispensation in case of failing, but the penalty takes hold the
curse follows upon it; But the covenant of grace, though it call
for perfection, such is the exactnesse of it, yet it accepts of sin∣cerity, such is the qualification of it through grace, or the mer∣cy in it. If I should take up any opinion in the world for the
Authours sake, or those that have appeared as Patrons of it, then
I should embrace this; The reverence deservedly due to him that
(I suppose) first manisted himself in it, hath caused it to finde
great entertainment, but upon more than twenty yeares
thoughts about it; I finde it labouring under manifold incon∣veniences.</P>
<P>1. It establishes the former opinion opposed by Protestants, and
but now refuted, as to the obedience and the degree, called for
in covenant; And if I should be indulgent to my affections, to
cause my judgement to stoop, Dislike of the one, would make me
as averse from it; as an opinion of the other would make me prone
to receive it. Judgement therefore must lead, and affections
be waved.</P>
<P>2. If this opinion stand, then God accepts of Covenant-breakers,
<PB N="152" REF="94"/>
of those that deale falsely in it, whereas Scripture
charges it only upon the wicked, upon those of whom God com∣plaines,
as rebellious, <HI>Deut. 29. 25. Josh. 7. 15. Jeremy 11. 10.
Jeremy</HI> 22. 8, 9. Yea, it may be charged on the best, the
most holy in the world lying under the guilt of it, according to
this tenent.</P>
<P>3. Then it will follow, that, as none can say, that they have
so answered the commands of the Law, that they have never
failed, they have not (if put to answer in the greatest rigour)
once transgressed, so, neither can they with the Church make ap∣peale
to God, <HI>That they have not dealt falsely in the Covenant,
nor wickedly departed from their God,</HI> Psal. 44. 17. Every sinne (ac∣cording
to this opinion) being a breach of it, and a dealing falsely
in it.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Then that great promise of</HI> mercy from everlasting to ever∣lasting,
upon them that fear him, and his righteousnesse, unto chil∣drens
children to such as keep his Covenant, and to those that remem∣ber
his Commandments to do them, <HI>Psalme 103. 17, 18. only apper∣taines
to those that so keep the Law, that they sinne not at all a∣gainst
it.</HI></P>
<P>5. Then our Baptism-vow is never to sin against God, and as
often as we renew our covenant, we do not only humble our
selves that we have sinned, but we afresh binde our selves, never
more to admit the least infirmity, and so live and die in the breach
of it.</P>
<P>6. Then the distinction between those that entered covenant
and broke it, as <HI>Jerem.</HI> 31, 32, 33. and those that have the Law
written in their hearts, and put into their inward parts to ob∣serve
it, falls, all standing equally guilty of the breach of it, no
help of grace being of power to enable to keep Covenant. Each
of these five last arguments are replyed to, by a distinction of the
precept, and conditions of the Covenant. Men that are sincere,
break the precept, (as is said) but not the conditions. But I
know no precepts in covenants, which are not conditions. Faith
and Repentance are Precepts, and I think, the alone Precepts,
and I know not, neither do I heare of, any other Con∣ditions.</P>
<P>7. Then it follows that, Sincerity is never called for as a duty,
or required as a grace; but only dispensed with as a failing, in∣dulged
<PB N="153" REF="94"/>
as a want. It is not so much a Christians honour or cha∣racter,
as his blemish or failing, rather his defect than praise. But
we finde the contrary in <HI>Noah, Job, Asa, Hezekiah, Zachary</HI>
and <HI>Elizabeth, Nathaniel,</HI> an Israelite indeed that entered cove∣nant,
and kept covenant. Sincerity is a degree towards perfe∣ction
in obedience, and if the command looks no lower than per∣fection
in degree, the imperfect degree is not commanded, though
it be indulged. And therefore I conclude, that, as in the
Law, there was pure justice as well in the command given, as
the penalty threatened, without any condescension or indul∣gence.
So, in the covenant there is mercy, and condescension,
as well in the condition required, as in the acceptance
through grace. The Covenant requires no more than it ac∣cepts.</P>
<P>The alone Argument,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> so farre as ever I could learn, that hath
brought some of reverend esteeme heretofore into this opinion, is
That if the covenant requires not exact perfection, in the same
height as the Law calls for it, then a Christian may fall short of
the Law in his obedience, and not sin, perfection being not call'd
for from him, nor any more called for from him, than through
grace he doth performe, he rises as high as his rule, and so sins not
through any imperfection, therefore to make it out that a belee∣vers
imperfections are his sins, it must needs be, that the covenant
requires perfection, as to make good that he may be saved in his
imperfections; it must be maintained that it accepts sincerity.
But this argument is not of weight, Christ entering a Gospel-co∣venant
with man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> findes him under the command of the Law,
which command, the Law still holds, the Gospel being a confir∣mation,
not a destruction of it. All imperfection then is a sinne
upon that account, that it is a transgression of the Law, though
(being done against heart, and laboured against) it is no breach
of covenant; We are under the Law as men, we are taken into
covenant as Christians, Retaining the humane nature, the Law
still commands us, though the covenant in Christ, through the
abundant grace of it, (upon the termes that it requires and ac∣cepts)
frees us from the sentence of it.</P>
<P>Here is objected, <HI>What shall we think of those Texts in the New
Testament, which require us to be perfect,</HI> 2 Cor. 13. 11. James 1. 4.
<HI>Yea, perfect as God is perfect,</HI> Matth. 5. 48. <HI>reproving weaknesse and
<PB N="154" REF="95"/>
infirmity, and commanding a going on to perfection. Answ.</HI> We
are to think of them as Protestant D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vines, ordinarily do in their
commenting upon them; <HI>We deny,</HI> saith <HI>Rivet, that the perfection
of which Scripture speaks, either when it commands us to be perfect,
or gives testimony of perfection, or integrity to some, consists in a
freedome from sinne,</HI> Exercit. 52. in <HI>Genes.</HI> pag. 267. The Text
quoted out of <HI>James,</HI> serves well to explaine the rest, <HI>Let patience
have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting
nothing,</HI> whence we may argue, 1. That perfection which
Christians may attaine, is the perfection that the Apostle calls
unto, This is plaine in the text, He calls for perfection, that we
may be perfect: But Christians can reach no further a degree in
perfection than sincerity; Therefore the Apostle calls onely to
sincerity. 2. That is the Apostles meaning, where he speaks of
perfection, that himself gives in as his meaning; This is cleare, he
is the best interpreter of himself; But he expresses himselfe by
<HI>perfect</HI> there to mean <HI>entire,</HI> or <HI>lacking nothing.</HI> A perfection of
entirenesse, or integrality then he meanes, a perfection of parts,
and not of degrees. For that text of <HI>Paul, 2 Cor. 13. 11. Finally
brethren, farewell, be perfect, &amp;c.</HI> let us compare with it, that
which he testifies of some in <HI>Corinth,</HI> 1 Cor. 2. 6. <HI>Howbeit we
speak wisdome among them that are perfect,</HI> that is, those that have
a right, and more full understanding of Gospel mysteries, put
in opposition to the weaknesse of novices, which perfection is,
(according to the Apostle) the way to unity of judgement. As
for the Text, <HI>Mat. 5. 48. Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father
which is in Heaven is perfect,</HI> If it be streined to the highest,
it calls for a divine increated perfection, our adversaries then
must yeeld, that there is a <HI>sicut similitudinis, non aequalitatis,</HI> in
that place. And if the context be consulted, we shall finde, that
it is opposed to that half hypocritical-righteousnesse, which was
found in Scribes and Pharisees; which all must exceed that enter
into the Kingdome of heaven. In <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 1. a novice-like
imperfection in knowledge, is reproved; and a further growth to∣wards
perfection is called for; It is further objected, <HI>If perfection
were not the duty of a Christian, and unperfectnesse, and infirmity
his sinne, why doth the Apostle groane, and grieve under the remain∣der
of his natural infirmities, and presse on to perfection,</HI> Rom.
7. 14. to the 24. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 12, 14? The conclusion here is granted;
<PB N="155" REF="95"/>
The one is a duty, the other is a sinne, and because of failing in the
one, and the burden of the other, the Apostle groanes. Foreseeing
that this would be yeelded him, there is added by way of objecti∣on,
<HI>Or is such unperfectnesse a sinne, onely in reference to the rule of
the Law, and not the rule of the Gospel, or that the Law doth, but
the Gospel doth not call for perfection? Answ.</HI> There is not one rule
of the Law, as I have demonstrated at large, and another of the
Gospel, seeing the Gospel establishes the Law; Onely the Gos∣pel-covenant,
calls for those sincere desires, which grace works, to
conform us in our measure of the rule of the Law.</P>
<P>There is yet a third opinion, which I may well doubt whether
I understand; but so farre as I do understand, I am as farre from
assent to it, as, either of the former, and that is of those who do
not only assert a personal inherent righteousnesse, as well as im∣puted
against the Antinomians; But also affirm that this righte∣ousnesse
is compleat and perfect, which if it were meant onely
of the perfection of the subject;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Evangeli∣cal righteous∣nesse is imper∣fect.</NOTE> as opposed to hypocrisie, dis∣simulation,
or doublenesse, implying that they do not only pre∣tend
for God; but are really for him, that they do not turne to
him feignedly (as <HI>Israel</HI> was sometimes charged, <HI>Jerem.</HI> 3. 10.)
but with an upright heart, or of the perfection, or entirenesse of
the object, respecting not one, or only some, but all command∣ments,
which is called a perfection of parts, we might readily
assent to it. The covenant calls for such perfection, <HI>Gen. 17. 1.
Walk before me, and be thou perfect,</HI> and many have their wit∣nesse
in Scripture, that they have attained to it, as <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. 7. 9.
<HI>Job,</HI> Job 1. 1. <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> Esay 38. 3. But a perfection above these
is maintained, a perfection compleat and full, <HI>Righteousnesse sig∣nifies</HI>
(as is said) <HI>a conformity to the Rule; and a conformity with
a</HI> quatenus, <HI>or an imperfect rectitude, is not a true conformity or re∣ctitude
at all: imperfect righteousnesse is not righteousnesse, but un∣righteousnesse.
It is a contradiction in adjecto,</HI> though holinesse
be acknowledged to be imperfect <HI>in all respects, where perfe∣ction
is expected, in reference to the degree that it should obtaine,
or the degree which it shall obtaine, or in reference to the excel∣lent
object, about which it is exercised, or in reference to the old
covenant, or the directive, and in some sense the preceptive part of
the new Covenant,</HI> in all these respects it is imperfect, <HI>and righteous∣nesse
materially considered is holinesse, and therefore thus imper∣fect,
<PB N="156" REF="96"/>
but formally considered, it is perfect righteousnesse, or none,
this not in relation to the old rule, but the new Covenant;</HI> Upon
this account, they are charged to discover grosse ignorance, that
use and understand the word righteous, and righteousnesse, as
they relate to the old rule, as if the godly were called righteous
(besides their imputed righteousnesse) only because their sancti∣fication
and good works have some imperfect agreement with
the Law of Works; This, and much more to assert, a personal
perfect inherent righteousnesse, as is said; all which as it is here
held out to me, is new, and I must confesse my self in ignorance
all over; I never took imperfect righteousnesse to imply any such
contradiction, no more than imperfect holinesse. <HI>Isaiah,</HI> I am
sure, saith, <HI>All our righteousnesse are as filthy rags,</HI> Esay 64. 6. No
greater charge of imperfection can lie against the most imperfect
holinesse, than the Prophet lays upon our righteousnesse. Neither
do I understand, how holinesse should be imperfect, taken mate∣rially,
and righteousnesse perfect, taken formally in reference to a
rule. We may (for ought I know) as well make holinesse formal,
and refer it to a rule, and righteousnesse material, in an absolute
consideration, without reference to any rule at all. And in such
consideration I do not know how there can be perfection or im∣perfection
either in holinesse or righteousnesse; it is as they come
up to, or fall short of the rule that they have, the denomination
of perfection or imperfection. <HI>Pauls</HI> Gospel-frame, whether
you will call it righteousnesse, or holinesse, is set out, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.
full of imperfection, yet all this, as in reference to the rule, as
it answered or fell short in conformity to it, <HI>verse 22. I delight in
the Law of God after the inward man.</HI> And whereas a charge of
ignorance, is laid even upon learned Teachers; that commonly
understand the word righteousnesse, and righteous as it referres
to the old rule, I professe my self to have little of their learning,
but I am wholly theirs in this ignorance. I know no other rule
but the old rule; the rule of the Moral Law that is with me, a
rule, a perfect rule, and the only rule. The perfection of this
holiness and righteousness in mans integrity, stood in the per∣fect
conformity to this Law, and the reparation of this in our
regenerate estate (in which the Apostle places the image of God)
must have reference as to God for a patterne, so to his Law as a
rule. As an image carrying an imperfect resemblance of its
<PB N="157" REF="96"/>
samplar, is an image, So conformity imperfectly answering
the rule is conformity likewise. A perfection of sufficiency to at∣taine
the end I willingly grant, God condescending through
rich grace to crown weak obedience, in this sense our imper∣fection
hath its perfectnesse; otherwise I must say that our in∣herent
righteousnesse is an imperfect righteousnesse, in an im∣perfect
conformity to the rule of righteousnesse, and without
thir reference to the rule there is neither perfection nor imper∣fection
in any action. See Doctor <HI>Davenant</HI> disputing against
justification by inherent righteousnesse upon the account of the
imperfection of it <HI>de justitia habituali,</HI> pag. 349 and how fully
he was perswaded of the imperfection of this righteousnesse ap∣pears
in sentences prefixt before two Treatises as may be seen in
the margent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omnis humana justitia injusti∣tia esse de∣prebendi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, si divinitus districtè judicatur. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egor. Moral. lib. 21. Cap.</HI> 15.

<P><HI>In the last place I shall conclude that</HI> sincerity, <HI>in the way and
work of God, (which Scripture also calls by the name of</HI> truth,
integrity, simplicity, uprightnesse, perfectnesse, an heart in the work
of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant of grace re∣quires and acc∣cepts sincerity.</NOTE> whole and unfeigned) <HI>is that which the covenant of
grace doth require, and that which it accepteth; This God in
covenant gives in charge, and this he rewards and crownes.
The Law stands as a rule, and the charge in it, is, the highest top
of perfection, without the least indulgence in any case of failing,
suitable to the abilities that once were put into our hands, God
in Gospel-condescensions, will have this rule eyed; with a single
and upright heart universally eyed, and observed, both in our re∣turnes
from sin, and in our application to God in new obedience.</HI>

(which as we have heard is the other new covenant-condition)
brings us into communion with God; So this of a sincere heart and
walk, holds in communion, Faith gives accesse to God in grace,
and through sincerity we walk with God in grace, to glory; Both
of them are called for of God, both accepted with God, and both
of them crowned with glory. That in this degree obedience is
both required, and accepted, in the Gospel is evident. This
where oever it is, God observes and eyes.</HI> 2 Chron. 16. 9. For the

suppose it is evident that God in covenant calls for obedience, re∣quires

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The necessity of a Ministery, to bring men into Covenant
with God, and to bring them up to the termes
of the Covenant.</HEAD>
<P>FRom hence several Corollaries may be drawn, and Inferences
made. 1. Of the necessity of a Ministery a constant standing
Ministery, as, to bring men into covenant with God▪ so, to bring
them also up to the termes of the covenant, to a lively saving
faith, and sincere obedience; God works not man into covenant
by immediate voice, Neither doth he use the Ministery of An∣gels,
in his ordinary way of working of it. But when he
would take in, the Nations of the world, into covenant with
himself, he sends out his Ministers for that work, giving them a
Commission with gifts and abilities suitable <HI>to disciple all Nations,
Matth</HI> 28. 19.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where a Mini∣stery is not, there is no Co∣venant-people.</NOTE> Where a Ministery comes not, there that people

the Covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the
world.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the Go∣spel is tendered and refused there is no Covenant.</NOTE> And where the Gospel-covenant is tendered, and not
received, there that people continue out of covenant, <HI>rejecting
the councel of God against themselves,</HI> Luke 7. 30. and rendering
<HI>themselves unworthy of everlasting life,</HI> Acts 13. 46. This was the
case of the people of <HI>Athens,</HI> There <HI>Paul</HI> preacht, yet there he
setled (for ought we read) no Church of beleevers, though he
had there some particular Converts, <HI>Dionysius the Areopagite,
and a woman named Damaris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the Go∣spel is tendred, there is a peo∣ple in Cove∣nant.</NOTE> <HI>with others,</HI> Acts 17 34. Where the
word was delivered, and there received, there was a people in co∣venant
with God, as at <HI>Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, Thessalonica,
&amp;c.</HI> Those Ministers had the honour of planting, of laying the
first foundation, of preaching where <HI>Christ before had not been na∣med,</HI>
Rom. 15. 20. A people thus brought into covenant, do not
alwayes come up to the termes of the covenant; All covenanters
keep not covenant, their hearts are not steady in it; Therefore
there is no lesse necessity of a Ministery, in established Churches,
to keep up a people in Covenant with God, through the termes
of the covenant to bring them to the happinesse promised, Theirs
is the work of watering, of building on anothers foundation, of
preaching Christ, where Christ before, at least was known by
name, and in some sort professed. That there was such a Mi∣nistery
in the Church of the Jews, to teach <HI>Jacob his Laws, and Is∣rael
his judgements,</HI> to require what God in covenant called for, is
not denyed that a Ministery was necessary in the Primitive Apo∣stolique
times, to work men into covenant, and for the planta∣tion
of Churches, is confest likewise. But when the Apostles left
the world, then this order (as some say) sell with them, all Mini∣sterial
power died with them. <HI>We are made to beleeve</HI> (saith one)
<HI>because the Apostles were ordained by God to be Teachers of the
people, and endued with gifts for that end, that therefore there is a
like divine, though secret Ordination from God in the making of our
Ministers.</HI> Compassionate Samaritane, <HI>page</HI> 24, 25. But if the
Scriptures may be heard, this may soone be decided: I shall there∣fore
by arguments make it appear.</P>
<P>First, that God hath established a Ministery, and appointed it
through all the ages of the world to be perpetuated.</P>
<P>Secondly, I shall give reasons to manifest the necessity of such
<PB N="162" REF="99"/>
a Ministery to be thus established and continued.</P>
<P>That such a one is established, appears</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons pro∣ving the esta∣blishment of a Ministery to be perpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uated through all ages.</NOTE> By the work that they have to do, given them in commis∣sion,
by Christ Jesus, <HI>Matth. 28. 19 20. Go, Disciple all Nations,
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy
Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com∣manded
you.</HI> Here is commission given for the dispensation of
the Word and Sacraments. That of the Word, is either for lay∣ing
the first foundation, or for the superstruction, either for
their work of planting, preaching where Christ was never known
by name; or else for watering, to carry on that happy beginning.
Their first work in laying the first foundation, is given in charge
in these words, <HI>Disciple all Nations,</HI> which was not the work of
one age. Though <HI>Egesippus</HI> (as he is quoted by Doctor <HI>Andrews,</HI>
Preface to the Decalogue, <HI>page</HI> 7.) saith, <HI>That there was no known
Common-wealth in any part of the world inhabited, but within
fourty years after Christs passion received a great shaking off of
Heathenish Religion;</HI> yet the whole work after so many Centuries
of yeeres, is not yet done; Those that are learned in Geography
say, that there is not above the nineteenth part of the inhabited
world, that beares the name of Christian, and a great part of those
so over-runne with Barbarisme, that they have little more than a
name that they live; when yet we beleeve the work shall be
more universal, that as <HI>God was once knowne in</HI> Jury, <HI>his Name
great in Israel;</HI> So it <HI>shall be from the rising of the Sunne to the
going down thereof,</HI> Mal. 1. 11. <HI>And that the Kingdomes of the world
shall become the Kingdomes of our Lord and of his Christ,</HI> Revel. 11.
15. Their work of superstruction or building up of Disciples, is
given them in charge in these words, <HI>teaching them to observe all
whatsoever I have commanded you.</HI> As long as homage is due to
Christ, so long a Ministery is to be continued to call for it, and
give directions in it, which we finde farther held out, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.
11, 13, 14, 15. There is an enumeration of Ministerial functi∣ons,
extraordinary and ordinary, as there is an appointment of A∣postles,
Prophets, Evangelists; So, also of Pastors and Teach∣ers,
their work is there pointed out, <HI>for the perfecting of the
Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edifying of the body of
Christ;</HI> as also their duration and continuance, <HI>till we all come in
the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto
<PB N="163" REF="99"/>
a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of
Christ.</HI> When in the world all are Saints, and no imperfection
can be found in these Saints, nor any thing wanting in the My∣stical
body of Christ, when there is not an errour to be found,
either in judgement or practice, nor a seducer, or false teacher
feared, then, and not before, a Ministery may be spared; This will
not be, as long as there is a Devil in Hell, and a man with cor∣ruption
upon earth. There is not a man that opposeth a Ministe∣ry,
but the being of that man is an unanswerable argument for the
establishment of it. Their work for dispensation of the Sacra∣ments
is given in charge explicitely in those words, <HI>Baptizing them,
&amp;c.</HI> as implicitely in that charge, <HI>Teaching them to observe all that
I have commanded.</HI> This of Baptisme answers in duration to that
other Sacrament of the Lords Supper, 1 <HI>Cor. 11. 26. As oft as you
eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, you shew forth the Lords death
till he come.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, It appears in the promise of Christ Jesus, annext by
way of encouragement in this work, <HI>verse 20. Lo, I am with you
alwayes, even unto the end of the world.</HI> This is we see to the ut∣termost extent of time, alwayes, even <HI>all dayes,</HI> to the worlds end.
And howsoever some quarrel may be raised about the phrase
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Saeculi</HI> being taken in so various an acception in the
holy Scriptures; yet the subject matter whereon it is spoken, is
a work of more lasting (as hath been observed) than one age, to∣gether
with the phrase annext; <HI>The consummation or finishing,</HI> plain∣ly
signifies that this promise is for perpetuity till Christs coming
at the end of ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There was an end of ages at Christs first coming, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 26. There shall be an end of ages at his second coming. See <HI>Gomarus Tom. 2. p.</HI> 530.</NOTE>. That which puts a period to the Lords Supper,
must alone put a period to this work; And for any to make a
promise to a dying man, ready to yeeld up the ghost, for help
for many years, who is but to live few yeares, were a strange
promise; And to settle a function of the Ministery with a promise
of assistance through all ages, when it must be extinct in that age,
were as strange a promise. A promise to a Non-entity, or meere
<HI>Chimara.</HI> Ministers then are in the Church as Starres, not as
Meteors; they grow as Plants, not as Mushromes, their du∣ration
is not for a yeare, for an age, but through all
ages.</P>
<P>Thirdly, this appeares by the Apostles care for a succession,
Being not suffered to continue by reason of death, they took care
<PB N="164" REF="100"/>
for others to fill up their places; in the Churches which they had
planted. Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> (called, not by man, but by a vision and
voice from heaven) gives order for a Ministerial call by Ordina∣tion,
Giving charge to <HI>Titus,</HI> Tit. 1. 5. <HI>to ordaine Elders in every
City,</HI> and this by <HI>laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</HI> 1 Tim.
4. 14. to whom the care of Church-inspection was by him
committed, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 17. compared with <HI>verse</HI> 28. And <HI>Paul</HI> and
<HI>Barnabas</HI> in their journal, <HI>Acts 14. 23. Ordained Elders in every
Church, and recommended them to God with prayer and fasting,</HI> of
which more afterwards.</P>
<P>Fourthly, this appears in the setled Pastors, which were found
in constituted, established Churches. <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> in <HI>Philippi,</HI>
Philip. 2. 25. <HI>Archippus</HI> in <HI>Colesses,</HI> Col. 4. 17. Those of <HI>Ephe¦sus,</HI>
which gave the Apostles meeting at <HI>Miletum,</HI> Acts 20. 17.
<HI>John</HI> who lived longest of the Apostles, and wrote his Revelati∣on
towards the ending of his dayes in the Issle of <HI>Pathmos,</HI> Rev. 1.
9. in his banishment there for the testimony of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI>
writes several Epistles to the Angels, of the several respective
Churches in <HI>Asia,</HI> which Angels were to be his survivors, and are
not denied by any, to be Ministers of those several City-churches
there mentioned, Whether these Churches were such as have
been called Diocesan, Presbyterial, or Congregational, is not here
to be questioned, but that they were Ministers appointed over their
several charges, is out of question.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly, This appeares by the charge given for respect and e∣steeme
to be given to those who thus stood up in succession in such
established Churches,</HI> 1 Thes. 5. 12, 13. We beseech you, brethren,
to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord,
and admonish you, and to esteeme them very highly in love for their
works sake. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2 29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all
gladnesse, and hold such in reputation. Obey them that have the rule
over you, and submit your selves; for they watch for your souls, as they
that must give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not
with grief, for that is unprofitable for you, <HI>Heb. 13. 17. These
were not to be reviled, railed upon; but reverenced, honoured
and obeyed; and an Order not in being, is not to be thus ho∣noured.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, it appeares by the Ordinance of the Lord Jesus for
their liveli-hood and subsistence, 1 <HI>Cor. 9. 13, 14. Do ye not know
<PB N="165" REF="100"/>
that they which Minister about holy things, live of the things of
the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers
with the Altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which
preach the Gospel; should live of the Gospel.</HI> Here we finde three
things implied. 1. That there was a particular order of men in the
time of the Law, separated by God for the Ministerial work, and
designed by his especial appointment for that businesse. 2. That
there is a proportionable Ordinance of Christ in Gospel-times of
select men for that businesse. 3. That maintenance by Gods ap∣pointment
was designed, as for one, so for both in their respective
times and succession.</P>
<P>Seventhly, It is farther cleared, by that hand of Providence,
that hath answerably provided in all ages, men for this work, in a
constant succession. No age since the Apostles, have wanted them,
I say not that there was a Ministery in every age, in equal purity
and lustre, yet all ages held up that order, and Papacy, when the
Minstery was laid most low, found out those that were faithful
to Christ Iesus. Some set Providence so high, that they make it
a rule of life, as well, as, Scriptures; Me thinks it may be con∣fest,
that it gives some light to doubtful Scriptures, The analogy
of faith being held firme, somewhat may be gathered from it.
To give instance in those Scriptures which seeme to beare witnesse
of a glorious call of the Iewes, which most receive, and some que∣stion,
God so ordering by providence, that in the revoluti∣on
of so many ages, they still continue a distinct people, sepa∣rate
from others not joyning in their worship, but retaining
still their own; and keeping up the Scriptures of the Old Testa∣ment,
when no such thing can be said of any captivated disper∣sed
people, it seemes to speak that they wait for, and as it were,
expect when <HI>the vaile may be taken off; that they may returne to
the Lord.</HI> But here, providence seconding such clear Texts of
Scripture, such that leave not a doubt behinde them unlesse men
shut their eyes against the Sunne, may sure be acknowledged to be
an additional demonstration.</P>
<P>For reasons of the necessity of such an established Ministery to
be continued in constituted Churches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons evin∣cing a necessity of such an esta∣blished Mini∣stery.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. The Church of God is to continue, and have its abode
through all ages of the world; as long as a world is to continue,
so long a Church is to continue, in which God may have glory
<PB N="166" REF="101"/>
by Christ Jesus, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3. 21. and therefore compared to a moun∣taine,
as for eminence, so for continuance, <HI>Psalme</HI> 125. 1. to an
house built by Christ himself on a rock, against which the gates
of hell shall not prevaile. Now a Ministery and a Church can∣not
be separated; It is of the integrality, if not of the essence
of it. A Church setled by a Ministery, may continue being for some
time, though in much imperfection, without a Ministery, but will
soon be without being. This is confest of all that would hold up
a Church in being; whether Episcopal, Independent, or Presby∣terial.
They that would level a Ministery (which is the work
of many) would level all Churches upon earth also. They
would drive God from off the earth, and lay his glory in
the dust.</P>
<P>2. There must be intercourse between God and his people,
between earth and heaven in all ages. It shall at no time be
truly said with those Apostates, <HI>Ezek. 8. 12. The Lord hath for∣saken
the earth.</HI> Now there must be men designed, Embassa∣dours
appointed to carry on this work. As the Priests in the Law
were ordained for men in things appertaining to God, as <HI>Heb.</HI> 5. 1.
So the Ministers of the Gospel have a parallel institution in suc∣cession,
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 14. God in no age carries it on in an immediate
way and manner.</P>
<P>3. Take away this Ordinance of a Ministerial function, and all
spiritual miseries to an utter confused <HI>Chaos</HI> will presently and ne∣cessarily
follow. First, <HI>Ignorance,</HI> all spiritual darknesse and blind∣nesse.
As the setting of the Sunne brings darknesse upon the Ho∣rizon,
so the absence of a Ministery brings darknesse upon the
Church. <HI>They are the light of the world,</HI> Matth. 5. 14. John Bap∣tist
<HI>was a burning light,</HI> John 5. 35. Paul <HI>was sent to bring a peo∣ple
from darknesse to light,</HI> as <HI>Acts</HI> 26. 18. Their Ministery
is called a <HI>Vision,</HI> without them men are without light. It is the
highest of contradictions to cry up light, and cry down a Mini∣sterial
function. Secondly, <HI>Wickednesse;</HI> this follows from the for∣mer.
<HI>If a man walk in the night he stumbleth,</HI> (saith our Saviour)
<HI>because there is no light in him,</HI> John 11. 10. An ignorant man can∣not
be above a wicked man, <HI>Ephes. 4. 18. Alienated from the life
of God by reason of their ignorance that is in them:</HI> As that Prodi∣gal
(which the wise man brings in complaining, <HI>that he had not obeyed
the voice of his Teachers) was almost in all the evil in the midst of the
<PB N="167" REF="101"/>
Assembly,</HI> Prov 5. 12. So, they may say that want Teachers;
<HI>Blinde places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty,</HI> Psal.
74. 20. Thirdly, <HI>Errour, Heresie, Blasphemy.</HI> This is evident.
1. In Reason. Men that want a guide must needs go astray,
Sheep without a Shepherd, cannot long hold their walk. The
Apostle knew, <HI>that after his departure, ravening wolves would a∣rise,
not sparing the flock,</HI> Acts 20 29. What a Wolf is to the flock,
that a seducer is to the Church. These waited the opportunity of
the Apostles absence; Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be
scattered; when there is no shepherd in <HI>Israel,</HI> every man does that
which is right in his own eyes, as when there is no King in <HI>Israel.</HI>
2. By Experience, What grosse opinions in worship did the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI>
entertaine in <HI>Moses</HI> his fourty days absence from them?
Let us go no further than our selves, Since a Ministery in <HI>England</HI>
was blasted, and men made it their honour to revile and reproach
it; how fruitful have we been in those monsters, from the lowest
step of Semiseparation, to the highest pitch of Rantisme? which
hath occasioned all those attestations to the truth of Christ Jesus
against Errours, Heresies, and Blasphemies of this time, from
the Ministers of Christ, in most parts of this Nation. Jesus Christ
leaving not himself without witnesse, In which we may see lists of
them unto trembling amazement. But if we cannot see it at
home, let us heare of it from abroad, from the penne of a
Protestant Divine, making observation of the state of the Church
in <HI>England,</HI> gives this sad, and too true report unto the world:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Anglia bis 4. annis facta est collu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies &amp; lerna omnium errotum &amp; se∣ctarum: nulla à condito orbe provincia tam parvo spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io tot manstrosas hae∣reses protulit, atque haec.

all Errours and Sects, No Province from the beginning of the world,
ever brought forth, in so little a space, so many monstrous Heresies, as
this.</HI> Honor. Reggus Comment de statu Ecclesiae in Anglia, pag. 1.
Hath Christ any thing that he may enjoy unquestioned among
us? As he may not have an Embassadour, so he must not enjoy
a Day, or an Ordinance, not so much as his Deity among us.
3. If neither Reason nor experience, will serve to convince us,
let the Apostle be heard, <HI>Ephes. 4. 11, 14. He gave gifts un∣to
men, some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists,
and some Pastors, and some teachers, that we be not as children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost
to and fro, with every winde of Doctrine.</HI> One end of the Ministery
is establishment of Saints against Errours. And it is not the
least of the cunning sleights of men to throw down a Ministery,
<PB N="168" REF="102"/>
that errour may be introduced, and Heresies planted, we must
not look to be secure from Seducers, longer than a Ministery
ballasts us.</P>
<P><HI>It is objected that in New Testament-times,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections a¦gainst a Mini∣sterial Ordi∣nance answered Joel 2. 28, 29. vindicated.</NOTE> <HI>there is a Promise,
that</HI> God will poure out his Spirit on all flesh, sonnes and daughters
shall prophecy; your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall
see visions. And also upon the servants, and upon the handmaids, in
those dayes will I poure out my Spirit, <HI>Ioel</HI> 2. 28, 29 So that now
this office is not with limit to some, but promiscuously in
all.</P>
<P>First,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> Old Testament-prophecies must be understood accord∣ing
to New Testament-Interpretations, Not alwayes, as in the let∣ter
they may seem to hold things out, but as the Spirit of God
there unfolds them; and as the event to those that live in after∣ages
in the Church, cleares them. The rigid adhering to the
letter of mystical prophecies, hath brought many into dangerous
snares. This holds the Jews in blindnesse, Looking after a
<HI>Messiah,</HI> with a temporal rule and power, they will re∣ceive
no other. This caused many in Christs time, to expect <HI>Eli∣jah</HI>
in person, and not to regard <HI>John,</HI> who came in the power and
Spirit of <HI>Elijah.</HI> This holds those of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that
they see not that Antichrist, who opposeth Christ in a mystery,
but expect one that opposeth Christ openly. And let others take
heed, that it do not deceive them, while they look after a personal
reigne of Christ upon earth, which some mysterious Scriptures
seeme to imply, when open cleare Texts do manifestly con∣tradict.</P>
<P>Secondly, when in New Testament-times, this prophecy was first
fulfilled, observe what way was taken for the fulfilling of it, The
Spirit comes <HI>in the forme of tongues, fiery and cloven, and sate upon
each of the Apostles,</HI> and this <HI>Peter</HI> sayes, was that which was fore∣told
by <HI>Joel</HI> the Prophet, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 16. There is a singular analogy
between Scripture-signes, and the thing signified; whether
ordinary in Sacraments, or extraordinary in Visions. This shews
in what manner, and way, the Spirit is communicated, in all Lan∣guages,
and Nations, and that the Spirit is received <HI>by the hearing
of Faith;</HI> If <HI>Peter</HI> may interpret <HI>Joel,</HI> a Ministery is established, and
not overthrown.</P>
<P>Thirdly, those high expressions there, serve only to set out the
<PB N="169" REF="102"/>
abundance of knowledge which men by the Ministerial work
should reach in Gospel-times; what Prophets then saw, and
those that saw visions, and dreamed dreames knew, that men
of all ranks should see, What the Prophets diligently enquired af∣ter,
1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12. they should understand.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I could wish that these men would compare another
prophecie of New Testament-times, <HI>Zach.</HI> 13. 2. where the
Lord promises to cause <HI>the Prophets, and the unclean spirits to passe
out of the land.</HI> Prophets there, are men of unclean spirits; those
<HI>false spirits that are gone out into the world.</HI> These shall be brought
to a serious conviction, <HI>and shall be ashamed every one of his Vision,</HI>
of the spirit of the which they use to speak, the revelation of
which they were wont to boast; and shall <HI>no longer weare a rough
garment to deceive,</HI> sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l relinquish that calling, function or practice,
giving in this reason; <HI>I am no Prophet, man taught me to keep cat∣tel
from my youth.</HI> Because they were bred for husbandry, man ano∣ther
way, therefore they are not for this function; In the case
of extraordinary inspiration, this indeed holds not; <HI>Amos</HI> pleads,
<HI>Amos 7. 14. I was no Prophet, nor a Prophets son, but I was an herd∣man,
and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit;</HI> He was thus trained up, and
therefore lived in this calling, in which he was trained, till God
gave him an extraordinary call; and this he pleads, <HI>The Lord
took me as I followed the flock, and the Lord said unto me, Go, pro∣phesie
to my people Israel,</HI> verse 15. <HI>Robinson</HI> the learnedst Penne
(I suppose) of that party, undertaking to defend the liberty of
all, promiscuously to preach the Gospel, and that it is no proper
work of a Select Ministery, instances in Christ and his Apostles,
who preacht (saith he) in the Jewish Church without contradi∣ction:
And whereas we except against this; that they were ex∣traordinarily
called, and qualified, he answers, that the excepti∣on,
though true, yet is not of force, for their argument is not that
they preached (which their extraordinary call would warrant,)
but that they preached and were not excepted against by the
Jewes; who did not beleeve any extraordinary immediate call
of theirs, yet never excepted against them; but received them,
upon the account of private men, and therefore it appears that it
was their ordinary course, that any gifted man might preach with∣out
control.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> It is wonder,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> so quick-sighted a man, could not see that Christ
<PB N="170" REF="103"/>
himself was excepted against by the Jewish Elders, and that
upon this very point, how often we know not, but we see it up∣on
record, in three several Evangelists that the excepted against
him. <HI>The chief Priests and the Elders of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to him as he
was teaching, and said, by what authority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou these things,
and who gave thee this authority?</HI> Luke 20. 21. Matth. 21. 23.
Mark 11. 7. Their argument runs thus: They that preach the
Gospel must have their authority for it. Thou undertakest this
work, produce thy authority, let us see thy warrant? Christ an∣swers
not, that it was each mans l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berty, and duty, who had gifts,
as he must have done, else he was wanting in his defence of the
truth, in case their proposition had been false, but puts a question,
in which he clearly holds out his extraordinary call; The ba∣ptisme
of <HI>John,</HI> whence was it, from heaven, or of men? As <HI>John</HI>
Baptized, so I preach. He baptized not, neither do I preach
without authority, whence we may collect that he that may pre∣sume
to set up a new Sacrament, without farther authority, may
with the same liberty, undertake to be a Gospel-Preacher.</P>
<P>2. <HI>That Prophecy is objected,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Jerem. 31. 31, 32, 33. 34. This
shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of <HI>Israel;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jerem. 31. 31, 32, 33, 34. vindicated.</NOTE> After
those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts,
and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my
people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know
me from the least of them, even unto the greatest of them, saith the
Lord, for I will forgive their inquity, and remember their sin no
more.</P>
<P>This Text is frequently produced for several purposes,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> as to
assert an unconditional covenant, (that all lies on Gods hand,
and we are engaged to nothing) so to decry all Gospel-Ordinan∣ces,
all use of a Ministery to teach the good knowledge of the
Lord; Some make use of it for one of these ends, and confesse it
will not serve for both; It will set up an unconditional covenant,
but it will not destroy New Testament-Ordinances; Others will
have it serve both, when the truth is aright understood, it serves for
neither.</P>
<P>The two first branches of the former answer will give satisfacti∣on
here; If Old Testament-Prophecies are to be understood ac∣cording
to New Testament-Interpretations, then no unconditi∣onal
<PB N="171" REF="103"/>
covenant will here be established, nor yet Gospel-Ordinan∣ces
decryed; seeing in the New Testament, covenant-conditions
are clearly and undeniably held out, and a Gospel-Ministery esta∣blished,
which already in both parts is fully cleared. A Ministery is
set up with instructions to require faith and repentance, and that
upon those termes, that without them there is no remission of sins,
no salvation.</P>
<P>2. As to that, for which it is here produced, it rather serves for
overthrow of mutual conferences, Christian communion for mu∣tual
edification, than the Ministerial power. The Text is, not
that ye shall have no more Teachers in publick; <HI>But they shall
teach no more every man his brother, and every man his neighbour; for
every one shall know him, &amp;c.</HI> The Apostles charge, <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 16.
flies full in the face of this Interpretation, <HI>Let the Word of Christ
dwell in you plenteously in all wisdome, speaking to one another,</HI> This
Prophecie is so streined, that there is no need of such admonition,
nor any use of brotherly exhortations. Certainly neither of these
inferences from this Prophecie, were in the Apostles thoughts,
when he exhorted the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> 1 Thes. 5. 11. <HI>Comfort
your selves together, and edifie one another, even as also ye do,</HI>
adding in the next verses: <HI>And we beseech you brethren to know them
which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish
you, and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake, &amp;c.</HI>
The councel had been more sutable, to have bid them to have
ceased this mutual consolation, and edification; And, as for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se
that were over them, that distinction of <HI>over,</HI> and <HI>under,</HI> was An∣tichristian,
that they must cease to honour, and make it their busi∣nesse
to level them. But above all, it is wonder, how those that
are high, in setting up, all for Teachers, and will have liberty of
prophecie promiscuous, can with face urge this Text, The letter
of it being against, <HI>brother and brother, neighbour and neighbour,
teaching one another,</HI> and not against a Ministerial way for edifi∣cation.</P>
<P>3. For the full interpretation of the words, that of King <HI>James</HI>
must be acknowledged; In mystical prophecies, it is farre more
easie to confute an absurd interpretation; than finde out a true
one. One that joynes in the former part, to establish an uncon∣ditional
covenant, against New Testament-light, yet leaves
them in the latter, and says, The <HI>not teaching one another, there spoken
<PB N="172" REF="104"/>
of, is meant of that obscure teaching which was under the Law.</HI> I wish
that his party would here heed him, and that himself would consi∣der,
that when he would have them to recede from the rigid adhe∣ring
to the letter of this part of the prophecie, for overthrow of
all helps for knowledge, whether he have not equal cause to recede
from that which he, would with like rigour fasten upon it; I shall
undertake as clearly from the New Testament, to hold out con∣ditions
in the covenant of Grace; as any other man shall finde
either warrant, or Ordinance for publick, or private admonition
or exhortation; <HI>They shall not have so much need of teaching as for∣merly,</HI>
say the <HI>Annotations</HI> on that place, and it is plaine, that, that
is often spoken in Scripture negatively; that is meant comparative∣ly;
<HI>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice,</HI> Hos.
6. 6. When he would have both mercy and
sacrifice, though mercy preferred above sacri∣fice.
<HI>Calvin</HI> hath fully spoken to this objecti∣on,
satisfying both his Adversary and his Rea∣der,
giving them a full refutation, and the
Text a good interpretation:<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Quòd autem fanatici homines hinc occasionem arripiunt, abolendae exterrae praedicationis, acsi sub Christi regno esset superuacua, facilè corum insania rejell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tur.

The Prophet doth not deny that one
should teach another, but these are his words;
They shall not teach one another, saying, Know
the Lord; as though he should say, such ignorance
should not possesse the minds of men as heretofore,
that they should not know who the Lord is, for
we know there is a twofold use of teaching. First,
That those that were altogether ignorant, may
begin with the first elements; and afterwards
that they that are thus entered, may make a far∣ther

progresse. Therefore when Christians as long as they live ought
to learn, there is none so wise, but need to be taught, so that a teach∣able
disposition is not the least part of wisdome, and what our
way to profit is, if we will be Christs Disciples,</HI> Paul <HI>sheweth
in his Epistle to the</HI> Ephesians, chap. 4. 11. <HI>He gave gifts unto

to be supplyed in other Scriptures, then the whole scope of
the place were cleared: For the Jews as they did make use of the
teaching of men, so, for the generality they rested in it; Here they
are taught that which they never minded, the necessity of the
concurrence, of Gods teaching with mans, that when man disco∣vers
the object, God should put in frame the Organ. Certain it
is, that when other prophecies foretell in New Testament-times,
mens zeal, to stirre up one another in the knowledge of God, (as

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Schooles and Nurseries of Learning, in order to a
gifted Ministery necessary.</HEAD>
<P>AS a Ministery is to be established, to bring men into Cove∣nant,
and to bring them up, to the termes of the covenant,
so all that necessarily conduces to it, is necessarily to be provided.
First, Nurseries, Seminaries, Seed-plots, for gifts and abilities fit∣ting
for it, and sutable to it. <HI>Qui vult finem, vult media,</HI> is a cer∣tain
rule; the end ever supposes the way to it. He that will be a
workman, must have tools; He that will fight a battel, must have
<PB N="174" REF="105"/>
armes; He that will make a Purchase, must have moneys; As, other
things, so, the Ministery must have its due preparations. Christ ha∣ving
commissioned the twelve, for the work of discipling Nations,
they must not set upon it, till they were enpoured for it. We have
not inspiration; that is to be supplied by education, the way that
<HI>Paul</HI> gave in charge to <HI>Timothy, Give attendance to reading,</HI> 1 Tim.
4. 13. <HI>Meditate wholly on these things, that thy profitting may appear
to all,</HI> verse 15. As he had not health by miracle, but in the use of
means, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 23. so, neither had he gifts for the Ministery,
but by study. A way for the advancement of study is therefore
necessary, and though neither Law nor Gospel, do in the letter
expressely appoint them; no more than they did Synagogues for
the Jewes, and the like places of Assembly for Christians, yet by
way of necessary consequence, both Law, and Gospel call for
them, seeing they expressely call for that, which without these
cannot be effected. A School to teach letters, with the Art of spel∣ling,
that we may be able to read, is not any where appointed,
The Holy Ghost speaking to men of the light of Reason; and re∣quiring
knowledge of the Law by searching the Scriptures, and
meditation in it, knew, this was needlesse: As petty Schooles for
private Christians, so are Schooles of a higher nature, for the Mi∣nisterial
Function; Therefore, as all Sects whatsoever had
their Schooles, to advance their way; <HI>Stephen</HI> met with some of
them at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Universities of necessary use.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Athens,</HI> so, we finde the like for the
propagation of the knowledge of the Law of God, The Sonnes of
the Prophets say to <HI>Elisha,</HI> 2 King. 6. 1. <HI>Behold, the place where we
dwell is too strait for us.</HI> Sonnes of Prophets, were no other than
Pupils, or Scholars of the Prophets, and we see, that they
made their abode together, and their number encreased; To this
<HI>Solomon</HI> alludes in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> in the Person of Wisdom, <HI>My
sonne, receive my instruction;</HI> and our Saviour also, <HI>Wisdom is justifi∣ed
of all her children,</HI> Mat. 11. 19. Such a place there was at <HI>Naioth</HI>
in <HI>Ramah,</HI> whither <HI>David</HI> fled, and <HI>Saul</HI> followed him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.

who exercised themselves in the Law of God, that the do∣ctrine
of salvation might be propagaed throughout the whole region
of</HI> Israel. So <HI>Calvin</HI> on the place, <HI>Naioth habitatio quaedam, &amp;c.</HI>
Naioth <HI>was the dwelling of the Prophets in</HI> Ramah, <HI>where the be∣leevers
<PB N="175" REF="105"/>
gave themselves up to the study of Gods Law, and were called
the sonnes of the Prophets.</HI> Pellican <HI>in locum,</HI> pag. 200 And from
these wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Willer</HI> on the place (out of <HI>Peter Martyr</HI>) concludes,
that <HI>The noble foundation of Vniversities, and Schools of Learn∣ing,
is grounded upon the example of the Prophets.</HI> To this end
there was a Colledge in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where <HI>Huldah</HI> the Prophetesse
did live, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34. 22. And <HI>Jeremy</HI> who lived in the same time,
speaks of the Prophets of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as of the Prophets of <HI>Sa∣maria,</HI>
Jerem. 23. 13, 14. In either places they had, as appeares,
Schooles of the Prophets. After the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
Schooles for learning were still held up by the Jewes. They had
their University in <HI>Tiberias,</HI> as <HI>Weemes</HI> observes, <HI>Christian Syna∣gogue,
page 148. In</HI> Babylon, saith he, <HI>there were three famous
Vniversities,</HI> Neharda, Sora <HI>and</HI> Pambeditha. He farther saith,
<HI>Colledges were appointed to receive strangers, and were called</HI> Labro∣thenu,
<HI>which is corruptly read</HI> Libertines, <HI>Acts</HI> 6. 9. By the same

of your minde, They very well agree to both, as may sufficiently
appeare in that which hath been said They that propagate his
Name and worship, must know it; and this is the way to attaine
to knowledge, For the forbidding of labour, I know no such ex∣presse
statute, but the very being of Schools, of this kinde is incon∣sistent
with it. A School for Tongues, and Arts, cannot be a shop
for Trades, Can we think, those Sons of the Prophets that stu∣died
under <HI>Elisha,</HI> or those Prophets under <HI>Samuel,</HI> had their em∣ployments
of manufactures or tillage? If they had been men of
labour, they would sure have had an Axe among them, and not
have been put to borrow. To be a Prophet and an Husbandman,
as <HI>Zach. 13. 5. taught from youth to keep cattel;</HI> cannot stand to∣gether,
as hath been shewn. The Levites had no land for tillage,
nor yet do we read that they drove any trades, Their work we
finde prescribed them, <HI>Deut. 33. 10. They shall teach</HI> Jacob <HI>thy
judgements, and</HI> Israel <HI>thy Laws, they shall put incense before thee,
and whole burnt-offering before the Altar.</HI> So for Ministers of the
Gospel, we hear of their <HI>labour in Word and Doctrine,</HI> their charge
<HI>to preach in season and out of season.</HI> For the forbidding of marriage;
there is no such thing, who hath not known men, in that state in
the Universities, and Resident in Colledges? It is true that those
Students, that have their maintenance from the Founders do∣nation,
upon marriage lose their place, but do not incurre expul∣sion.
And the thing is very equal, seeing those places are not in∣tended
for a setled abode, (as some abuse them) but for Preparati∣on
for publick employment, whether in Church or State, and who
blames those ties of Apprentices from marriage, for the terme of
their service to know their trades? If wives and families should be
taken in, they would soon finde the inconvenience that the sonnes
of the Prophets complained of, their dwellings would be too strait
for them.</P>
<P>Object.<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Have not the Vniversities sacrilegionsly stole this blessed

not an equal sacriledge, for some peculiar men to take the title of
the Sons of the Prophets, who (as it is plain) were not their chil∣dren,
but their Scholars, and therefore the Prophets, (under
<PB N="177" REF="106"/>
whose tuition they were) were called by them, as, by the name
of Father, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 2. 12. so, also by the name of Master, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 6. 5.
being those Masters of the Assemblies that the Wise man speaks of,
<HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. Others heard the doctrine, and as sons received the in∣structions
of the Prophets as well as they, yet the title is given pe∣culiarly
to some, who in a peculiar way were separate for that
work, not common to all men, much lesse to women. Besides, the
word Scholler is plainly in relation to Schooles, men may learn
Christ and be his disciples, is confest, though they be not Scholars in
this way.</P>
<P><HI>I know no Schooles of the Prophets in the New Testament,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>but the
particular Congregation of Christ Jesus. And I question whether it
be any thing but sinne that hath dried up this current of the Spirit,
in those rare gifts of tongues, to Gods sonnes and daughters, ser∣ving
so admirably, both for the understanding of the Original Scri∣ptures,
and also for the propagating of the Name of Christ. Who knows
but that it may please the Lord, again to cloath his People, with a Spirit
of zeal, and courage for the Name of Christ, yea and poure forth those
fiery streames again of tongues, and prophecy in the restauration of Zi∣on?</HI>
Bloody tenent page 174. I am glad to here it confessed, that
sinne is displeasing to God, and that any judgement on the Church
is confest to be let in at this gate; I am glad farther to hear that
tongues serve, so admirably to propagate the Name of Christ,
whence I infer, that while this judgement for sin continues, there is
a necessity of other courses to attaine this, that is acknowledged
to be of this excellency. Since the judgement was laid on the earth
for sin, men have got their bread with labour, and so must as long
as the judgement remaines. The like paines must be for learning
as for a living; When God shall please to poure out again these
fiery streames, we then shall confesse the unusefulnesse of Schools
to this purpose, in the mean space their use is evident. And
seeing it is acknowledged that <HI>men must digge with daily study,
and labour to come at the Original fountaines;</HI> let none be like
<HI>Pharaoh</HI> to urge a tale of brick, and deny straw. If they must thus
digge, let them not be necessitated to go to the Papists to sharpen
their spades, as sometimes <HI>Israel</HI> to the <HI>Philistines,</HI> with their
goads and mattocks, which yet necessarily will be, if their Schools
be kept up, and ours cried down. Mr. <HI>Ainsworth</HI> is brought in
for an instance, who (as is said) <HI>had scarce his peer, among a thousand
<PB N="178" REF="107"/>
Academians for the Scripture-Originals, and yet he scarce set foot
within a Colledge walls.</HI> His abilities in the tongues is evident
(which was his Master-piece) but his education I know not but one
Swallow makes not a Spring. I have known a man excellent, in the
most exquisite manual trade, who yet never served a Master to learn
it, yet this never took men off the way of Apprentiships If Mr.
<HI>Ainsworth</HI> scarce set foot in a Colledge walls, yet he reaped the
fruit of their labours that were studied, and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way excelled. Is
this the honour that you professe to give to Schools for Tongues
and Arts, to perswade men not to set their foot within
them?</P>
<P><HI>Another goes yet here farther,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>not only to put down Schooles,
and demolish Academies for learning but to deny any necessity or
use of learning at all, yea, any necessity of a Ministery for inter∣pretation
of Scripture, as the</HI> Compassionate Samaritane, <HI>page</HI>
29, 30, 31. One interest (<HI>among others by him named</HI>) of Mini∣sters,
is to perswade the people, that the Scriptures, though we have
them in our tongue, are not yet to be understood by us, without their help,
and interpretation, so that in effect we are in the same condition with
those we have so long pitied, that are forbid to have the Scriptures in
their own tongue; for it is alone, not to have them in our own tongue, and
to be made beleeve that we cannot understand them, though we have
them in our own. Is the cabinet open to us? and do we yet want a key?
has so much labour been spent? so many translations extant, and are
we yet to seek? Let us argue a little with them; either the Scriptures
are not rightly translated, or else they are; if they are not, why have
we not been told so all this while? why have we been cheated into er∣rours?
if they are rightly translated, why should not English men under∣stand
them? The idiomes and proprieties of the Hebrew and Greek
languages, which some say, cannot word for word be exprest in English,
might all this while have been translated into as many English words,
as will carry the sense thereof.</P>
<P>For the dilemma concerning the Scriptures rightly translated,
or not rightly; I may apply that of <HI>Job, chap. 6. verse 15. How
forcible are right words, but what doth your arguing reprove?</HI> and
answer in a word, that they are rightly translated according to
the reach of a humane work, and more rightly than the trans∣lation
followed so much by the Evangelists and Apostles. I sup∣pose,
all will yeeld that ours is more exact after the Original, than
<PB N="179" REF="107"/>
was that of the Seventy; And yet there was no cheat in those
translations; if there had, those witnesses of Christ had not been
silent; and yet not such a perfection that will bear no amendment.
There is still use of examination of them, of asserting and de∣fending
them; But be it granted that the translation is every way
exact and full, does it follow that there needs no help or inter∣pretation?
The people of the Jewes had the Original it self, and
spake the language in which Scripture was written; yet <HI>the
Priests lips were then to preserve knowledge, and the people were to seek
the law at his mouth,</HI> Mal. 2 6. The cabinet was open to them, as
it is to us; yet there needed a key for farther opening. Those
two Disciples, with whom Christ had to deale with, upon the
way, had the Scriptures, either in the translation, or Original,
as is evident from Christs own words, reproving them for <HI>not be∣leeving
all that the Prophets had written,</HI> and yet a key of interpre∣tation
was needful, and useful; <HI>Christ opened unto them the
Scriptures,</HI> Luke 24. 32. If this <HI>Compassionate Samaritane</HI> were
questioned (as the <HI>Eunuch</HI> was by <HI>Philip) understandest thou what
thou readest?</HI> he would not have given his answer, <HI>How shall I
understand without an Interpreter?</HI> But would streight have an∣swered,
Yes, as well as any linguist in the world; I have no need
of your help for interpretation. The cabinet is open, spare your
key. This was one of the Arts, that some Prelates made use of,
to keep up a reading Ministery, to perswade, that Scripture were
so plaine distinctly read in our own tongue, that they might be
understood without any interpretation. But the plainnesse and
easinesse of a rule, and the use of means for understanding of it
stand together; We maintaine a plainnesse in Scripture for the
simple to understand, but not sitting idle, and lazy; but search∣ing
the Scriptures, and making use of those gifts of Christ, which he
shed forth from the right hand of the Father, <HI>for the edifying of
his body, till we come into the unity of the faith and knowledge of
the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man. That we might not henceforth
be as children, tossed to and fro with every winde of doctrine, by the
sleight of men and cunning craftinesse of those that lie in waite to de∣ceive,</HI>
Ephes. 4. 12, 13. We may soone see their artifice
that labour to beare them down, Thus they know their cun∣ning
sleight may be carried in the dark, and their impostures
lie undiscovered. Our compassionate man, pretending to avoid a
<PB N="180" REF="108"/>
cheat; acts the part of the most notable cheater. The Prophet
stood for that office of the Priests, that their lips should preserve
knowledge, even when they had corrupted the covenant of <HI>Levi,</HI>
Whatsoever their way was, yet this was their duty, so must we for
the Stewards of the mysteries of God, It is their work to dispense
them, and the people are to seek at their mouthes for them.
But enough I hope hath been spoke for a Ministery, for a
knowing Ministery, and objections against it fully satis∣fied.</P>

but no introduction to the Ministerial honour. These run, and
stay not for sending, and going without commission, they go

the Priesthood of the Law; there must be a call from God for the

Apostle; not of man, nor by man; he owes it not to man as the
Authour, so may any Minister of Christ say, he owes it not to man
as an instrument; so only Prophets and Apostles can say: As his
Calling was thus immediate, so in like sort was his instructions
for it, <HI>Gal. 1. 12. For I neither received if of man, neither was I
taught it; but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ.</HI> They that divide
these, are exceedingly to blame; assuming authority without man,
but confessing that for abilities, as they must look up to God, so
they must make use of man, must apply themselves to reading, and
make use of the helps of others.</P>
<P>The immediate Call is by Vision,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The immedi∣ate call is by vision, revela∣tion, &amp;c.</NOTE> Revelation, or whatsoever
otherway God pleases to manifest himself. Thus in a vision <HI>Paul</HI>
was called; where that is not, the mediate Call only remains,
which is the way of all that attaine to gifts by education, study,
and the blessing of heaven on their endeavours. This is called, as
in Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mediate and ordinary call is by Or∣dination.</NOTE> so in Church-writers, by the name of <HI>Ordination,</HI>
and the whole work (containing as well that which is essential to
it, as the adjuncts of it) may be thus described. <HI>An act of men
in a Ministerial function,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordination described, and in the several parts of it ex∣plained.</NOTE> <HI>associated in a Presbytery; setting some

<PB N="183" REF="109"/>
Titus</HI> is enjoyned <HI>to ordaine Elders in every City in Creet,</HI> Tit. 1. 5.
He is named alone, but the naming of one excludes not others,
and therefore it appears, that in <HI>Timothies</HI> Ordination, a Presby∣tery,
or a combination of Presbyters did joyne, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14.
which way in our Church hath ever been held. The Bishop (sup∣posed
by some, to be vested in the whole power of Ordination)
never had authority to ordaine alone; but grave Presbyters ac∣cording
to the Canon, were to joyn with him, though by reason
of greatnesse, his vote ordinarily did overmuch sway in it. Some
would have the people here to have their hand, in that the word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in that place of the <HI>Acts, chap.</HI> 14. 23. implies <HI>a
lifting up of the hand.</HI> But whatsoever the word in its Etymolo∣gy
may imply, the use is not such, as is plaine by comparing <HI>Acts</HI>
10. 41. where the immediate Ordination of God, by the same
word is held forth unto us. They know the weight of the Mini∣sterial
function, and they are best able to judge of requisite a∣bilities.
One that is willing to give as much to the people, as may
be, yet confesses that in Grammatical construction, the word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> can agree with no other but <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and
that it was only their act; and therefore he would finde it in the
word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which (saith he) <HI>doth not signifie in every
Church, as it is translated, but according to the Church</HI> instancing
in the Orators phrase, <HI>Faciam secundumte; I will do it according
to thy minde:</HI> So they (viz. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI>) ordained them
Elders, <HI>according to the Church, that is, according to the minde and
will of the Church.</HI> If this were granted, it would only conclude an
acquiescency in the people, and that they had satisfaction in that
Ordination, carryed on by <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas.</HI> Yet this phrase
here, can no where prove that the Church or people; made choise
of them, then we man prove from that injunction of the Apo∣stle,
<HI>Titus 1. 5. to ordaine Elders in every City,</HI> that the whole
City had there their vote in Elections; As much stresse may be
laid upon <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>in every City,</HI> or according to the minde
of the City, in this of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus,</HI> as upon <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>in e∣very
Church,</HI> or according to the minde of the Church, in that of
<HI>Luke</HI> in the History of the <HI>Acts.</HI> What power the people or the
faithful may have in Election, and how farre it may be conveni∣ent
that they may be overborne for their good, I will not here
dispute. I only conclude, that we finde not the people any
<PB N="184" REF="110"/>
where ordaining we read of Ordination in Churches, for the
Churches use, not Ordination by Churches, taking it in that sense,
for the whole community of Beleevers.</P>
<P>These,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Ordina∣tion is of Pres∣byters and Elders.</NOTE> in a Ministerial function in this act of Ordination, set
select men apart for Presbyters, or Elders; so <HI>Acts 14. 23. Titus
1. 5. Titus</HI> is enjoyned to ordaine Elders in every City in <HI>Creet,</HI>
who are the same with Bishops, as appeares in <HI>Titus 1. verse</HI>
5. 7. compared.<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Elders are the same with Bishops.</NOTE> The qualification of Elders is there pre∣scribed;
and the reason is given, <HI>for a Bishop must be blame∣lesse,</HI>
which will hold no congruity, if an Elder be not the same
with a Bishop, Which also may be seen, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. comparing <HI>ver.</HI>
17. and the 28. together. The Apostle there speaks to the Elders
of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and he gives them a charge, <HI>to take heed to all the
fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, over which the Holy Ghost had made them Overseers;</HI> that is,
had given them an Episcopal charge, as the word signifies. Elders
must set apart men for Elders, and Presbyters are to be set apart by
a Presbytery.</P>
<P>This Ordination of Elders is to be in the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are El∣ders of the Church uni∣versal.</NOTE> or for the
Church, which may be taken either for the universal Church vi∣sible,
or for some particular Church, and that either congrega∣tional
or classical. Ministerial functions are appointed of God,
for the Church universal visible. <HI>God hath set some in the
Church, first Apostles, secundarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, &amp;c.
1 Cor. 12▪</HI> 28. No one particular Church, congregational or clas∣sical,
enjoys all the particular kindes there enumerated, yet so as
the exercise of this function, is to be with limit to one particular
only. They are Ministers of the Church universal; yet so as or∣derly
to exercise their function, only there, where God by his pro∣vidence
shall designe them. There are some functions (as I may
say) <HI>Catholick,</HI> what such a one doth any where in his function,
is good every where, as a publick Notary, or Master of the Chan∣cery,
that which they do any where, is every where valid, within
the limit of that power under which they act; It is of force through
the whole Nation. Some functions are <HI>topical</HI> or <HI>local,</HI> as Justices
of Peace, a chief officer in a Corporation, Sheriff, or Constable,
who are without power out of their own limits. A Minister or
Presbyter is a Catholick or Universal Officer, he hath <HI>jus in re,</HI> in
the whole Church visible, for all Ministerial actions, whether of
Word or Sacraments, he hath <HI>jus ad rem,</HI> in the place assigned
<PB N="185" REF="110"/>
and appointed him, where alone he is regularly to officiate, and
so, hath the title of an Aggel, or Elder of such a particular Church
to which he is called, <HI>Rev. 2. 1, 7, &amp;c. Acts</HI> 20. 17. He hath a
first right every where, a second right only where he is order∣ly
placed.</P>
<P>This is to be done by examination or tryal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordination is to be past on examination or trial.</NOTE> if no word of Scri∣pture
did mention it, yet the thing it self evinces the necessity of
it; Scripture layes down the requisites or qualifications in Mini∣sters.
First, for years, <HI>not a novice, 1 Tim.</HI> 3. 6. Some are old young,
which may answer some want of years, more fit at twenty foure,
then others at thirty. Secondly, for conversation; <HI>Blamelesse,
as the Steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to
wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; but a lover of hospitality,
a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate,</HI> Titus 1. 7, 8. Third∣ly,
for parts and gifts; 2 <HI>Tim. 2. 15. A workman that needeth
not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of Truth,</HI> Tit. 1. 9. <HI>Hold∣ing
fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be
able by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convince gain-sayers.</HI>
Fourthly, for graces of the Spirit, they should be as <HI>Barnabas,
full of the Holy Ghost and of Faith,</HI> Acts 11. 24. From which
gifts of nature must not be excluded, as strength of body in its mea∣sure,
that the body may in some sort keep pace with the soule.
The gift of utterance, that not only his head, but <HI>his lips may
preserve knowledge,</HI> that he may be able to speak, <HI>to edification,
exhortation, and doctrine;</HI> of these such that act in Ordination,
should have knoweldge, of each of them so far, as they may come
to cognizance, of some of these by letters of commendation <HI>from
faithful persons, 2 Cor.</HI> 3. 1. of others by proof and examination,
1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 10. The Apostle having laid down the qualifications of
Bishops, and proceeding to that of Deacons; hath these words,
<HI>Let these also be proved, and then let them use the office of a Deacon;</HI>
both Bishops and Deacon must undergo examination. Timothy
<HI>must lay hands suddenly on none,</HI> 1 Tim. 1. 22. He must then lay
on his hands no otherwise, but upon proof and trial, which
the context (speaking of sins, some open going before to judge∣ment,
others following after) seems to evince, such cautiousness
cannot stand; without all possible wayes and means of proof and
trial</P>
<P>All this is to be solemnized by fasting and prayer; in which we
<PB N="186" REF="111"/>
have Scripture-precedents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To be solem∣nized with fasting and praye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> <HI>Act. 13. 2. When they had fasted and pray∣ed,
and laid their hands on them, they sent them away,</HI> Acts 14. 23.
<HI>When they had ordained them Elders in every Church, and had prayed
with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they beleeved.</HI>
This I take not, to be of the essence of Ordination; not necessary
to the very being; but the better being of it in imploring Gods
assistance and blessing. It is a great work, a work of glorius
concernment; it is a work above our strength to manage, more
weighty than our shoulders can bear, there is more than parts,
gifts and endowments, (whether natural or acquired) required
in it. All supplies being (as before we heard) to be expected
from heaven, heaven must be implored, God must be earnestly
sought in it. Fasting should add wings to our prayers, <HI>that our
voice may be heard on high.</HI> A shadow of this still remained in the
Church, as appers, by those <HI>Jejunia quatuor temporum</HI> at the
times of Ordination; which indeed, was almost brought to a meer
shadow.</P>
<P>The last thing mentioned in the Definition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imposition of hands to be used in Ordi∣nation.</NOTE> is imposition of
hands; A rite or usage in practice before the Law, <HI>Gen.</HI> 48. 14.
held in the time of the Law, <HI>Levit.</HI> 1. 4. and continued in the
dayes of the Gospel, as consisting with the simplicity of it. It
was used in <HI>blessing,</HI> Gen. 48. 14. Israel <HI>stretched out his right
hand, and laid it upon</HI> Ephraims <HI>head in his blessing of them.</HI> Matth.
19 13. <HI>They brought children to Christ, that he should put his hands
on them and pray;</HI> which accordingly he did, <HI>Mark 10. 16. He
put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</HI> It was used in <HI>Offerings,</HI>
Levit. 1. 4. <HI>If any man bring an Offering unto the Lord, he shall
put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering, and it shall be accept∣ed
for him, to make atonement for him.</HI> It was used in <HI>bearing wit∣nesse,</HI>
as <HI>Levit.</HI> 24. 14. Where the Lord gives charge concerning
the blasphemer; <HI>Bring forth him that hath cursed, without the
Camp, and let all that have heard him, lay their hands upon his head.</HI>
It was used in conferring <HI>extraordinary gifts,</HI> Acts 8. 17. <HI>Peter</HI>
and <HI>John</HI> laid their hands, on those that <HI>beleeved in Samaria, and
they received the Holy Ghost.</HI> It was used in <HI>miraculous cures,</HI>
Mark 6. 5. <HI>Christ could do there no mighty works, save that he
laid his hands upon a few sick folke, and healed them,</HI> Acts 28. 8.
It was used in <HI>designing men for office, and that either civil,</HI> for the
work of the Magistracy. <HI>Deut.</HI> 34. 9. Joshua <HI>the son of</HI> Nun <HI>was
<PB N="187" REF="111"/>
full of the Spirit of wisdome; for</HI> Moses <HI>had laid his hands upon him,
and the children of</HI> Israel <HI>hearkened unto him, and did as Lord
commanded</HI> Moses. Or Ecclesiastical, and that for the work of
the Lord in the time of the Law, <HI>Levit.</HI> 8. 10. and also in the
dayes of the Gospel, <HI>Acts.</HI> 13. 3. And from this rite of impositi∣on
of hands, (in use in this work of Ordination) the whole work
hath sometimes its denomination, 1 <HI>Tim. 5 22. Lay hands suddenly
on no man;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection answered.</NOTE> where imposition of hands is put for the whole work.
Some I know would take all this off, as to Ordination by laying on
of hands, by the objection of extraordinary gifts, which were this
way conferred, as was before confessed, of which they will have that
Text understood, 2 <HI>Tim. 1. 6. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance,
that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my
hands.</HI> But this is too weak to avoid, it for though we have already
said; that when the Holy Ghost was given in those extraordinary
endowments, hands were imposed, yet whole Presbyteries cannot
ordinarily be conceived, to be vested with that power, yet they
joyntly in this work laid on their hands, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 14. And that ad∣vice
of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy, 1 Tim.</HI> 5. 22. plainly contradicts it, <HI>lay hands
suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens sins.</HI> In case <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI>
had had that power to have conferred with the calling, qua∣lifications
for the calling, he had no need to have been in that way
advised, to use such circumspection. Why should he be so careful
to see them first fit, in case his laying on of hands would fit them?
There need not such trial whether they were gifted in case a touch
of the hand would be the gifting of them. And for <HI>Timothies</HI> Ordi∣nation
in the place quoted, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 6. it followes not from our
grant; that extraordinary gifts are there specified, that authority
for the Ministerial work is denied. It is plain that <HI>Moses</HI> authorized
<HI>Joshua,</HI> for succession in his place; by laying on of hands, <HI>Deut.</HI> 34.
9. The people upon that took him for his successor, yet it is
as plain in the Text, that the Spirit of wisdom was then conferred
upon him: Authority and power are sometimes given at once, yet
all that are in power to authorize, cannot impower for this busi∣nesse,
he that will see more, may read Dr. <HI>Seamans Treatise</HI> on this
subject, and <HI>jus divinum Ministerii Ecclesiastici.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ministers of Christ must bring their people up to the
termes of the Covenant, pressing the neccessity
of Faith and Repentance.</HEAD>
<P>THen it farther yet follows; that the Ministers of Christ
are to call their people unto these duties, before mentioned
as conditions. They must urge and presse the necessity of
Faith and Repentance. These are the termes of the covenant,
and stipulation, to which God in covenant doth engage, in which
the Apostles of Christ spent their paines, <HI>Testifying both to Jews
and Gentiles, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord
Jesus Christ,</HI> Acts 20. 21. And this must be the businesse of those
that make it their businesse to preach the Gospel in all ages. Men
must be taught to observe what Christ commands and teaches,
<HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 20. These Christ teaches, and gives in charge; Thus
he begun his Ministery, <HI>Mark 1. 15. Repent ye, and beleeve the
Gospel.</HI> They must so preach that men may not perish; that they
may not be the savour of death, But they only that beleeve, shall
not perish, <HI>John</HI> 3. 16. They that repent not, must perish, <HI>Luke</HI>
13. 1. They must so preach Christ, that men may have their in∣terest
in Christ, that they may not be cast off by Christ, But
Faith gives this interest: <HI>He dwells in our hearts by Faith,</HI> Ephes.
3. 17. Workers of iniquity must be cast off, <HI>Mat. 7. 23. Depart
from me all ye that work iniquity.</HI> It is no plain dealing in any of
the Ministers of Christ to make tender of promises, to hold forth
priviledges, and conceale the termes, upon which they may be
obtained; to speak of salvation to men in sinne, without so much
as the name of sanctification, or application to God in a way of
Repentance; to tell men in the Prodigals course, of the Fathers
bowels, and readinesse to meet them with kisses; without men∣tion
of the Prodigals humiliation or coming in, to tell them of
the <HI>many sinnes</HI> forgiven to the woman in the Gospel, <HI>Luk</HI> 7. 47.
without once mention of those many tears, that were shed in
evidence of her repentance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection answered.</NOTE> They say, that these are the strong∣est
motives to work men from sin. This I gladly yeeld when the
<PB N="189" REF="112"/>
promise is tendered, and with it repentance urged. I know it was
the way of the Prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The danger of severing the promise from the duty.</NOTE> <HI>Esay</HI> 55. 7. and therefore a prevalent
way; <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts, and let him returne unto the Lord, and he will have mer∣cy
on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> The way
also of the Apostle, 2 <HI>Cor. 6. 17. Be ye separate, saith the Lord,
and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</HI> But the se∣vering
of the promise from the duty, so that Christ is heard on∣ly
in a promise, not at all in a precept, when they heare that Christ
will save; but are never told that they must repent. These are
but delusions; Promise-Preachers, and no duty-Preachers; grace-Preachers,
and not repentance-Preachers, do but (as the Apostle
hath long since given warning) deceive with <HI>vain words,</HI> Ephes.
5. 6. This will never work men from sinne, but strengthen men in
sin, <HI>Ezek. 13. 22. Because with lies ye have made the heart of the
righteous sad, whom I have not made sad, and strenthened the hands of
the wicked, that he should not returne from his wicked way, by pro∣mising
life.</HI> These promises of life thus tendered, we see are lies,
for men in sinne, are men for death, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. 31. These pro∣mises,
strengthen the hands of men in sinne, that they return not
from it. It is the observation of many, that the false Prophets
so branded in the Old Testament, vented no errours in Faith, but
only misapplications of truths. They promised peace, where the
Lord had promised no peace; and therefore a <HI>false Prophet</HI>
among the Jews is distinguished from <HI>a false Teacher</HI> among
Christians, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 1. These latter <HI>bring in damnable heresies,</HI>
and so did not the former; But as ours outstrip them, in that
they bring in errours in faith, so they joyne with them in misap∣plications
of truths. <HI>If thou be a whoremonger, a blasphemer, a
drunkard, a mad man in iniquity</HI> (saith one, or words to that pur∣pose)
<HI>and there be no manner of change wrought in thee, yet come
and take Christ, &amp;c.</HI> Does any Gospel-Text, speak of such a mans
taking of Christ, without any manner of change wrought? Are
not those the enemies of Christ, that rise in hostile rebellion?
<HI>Psal</HI> 68. 21. And while they despise him, can they receive him?
We would not have such a sinner (if we can possibly imagine a
great sinner) kept from Christ Jesus; but he must come in at
the Gospel-door, He must come in the way of his call, He must
come to receive whole Christ in each function of his, He must
<PB N="190" REF="113"/>
come for every gift,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whole Christ must be re∣ceived, and all of his gifts embraced.</NOTE> which Christ poures out, He must come for
repentance from Christ, as a Prince, as well as remission of sins as
a Saviour, <HI>Acts 5. 31. God hath exalted him with his right hand
to be a Prince, and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and
forgivenesse of sinnes.</HI> He must come by the way of Faith for for∣givenesse,
This both Prophets and Apostles, Old Testament
and New Testament-Gospel calls for, <HI>Acts 10. 43. To him give
all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name, whosoever beleeveth
in him shall receive remission of sinnes.</HI> They must come by re∣pentance
and conversion in order to forgivenesse, <HI>Acts 3. 19. Re∣pent
ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,
when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</HI> I
do not say that there is no promise in Scripture made to a wicked
man, that is the greatest Gospel-paradox; But I say, they are not
made good, to wicked persons. They are made to the wicked,
made good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Promises are made to the wicked, made good only to the beleeving and penitent.</NOTE> that is, performed, to the beleeving and penitent. To
finde a promise made, and made good, that is, tendered and per∣formed
to a man unbeleeving, impenitent is indeed a labour. One
replying to this question, <HI>What, if I have not those conditions in me, as
to feel my self hungry, thirsty and heavy-laden?</HI> answers, <HI>If you
finde not these or such conditions in you;</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Objections answered."/> <HI>then you are not to apply your
self to those promises, that are made to such as have those conditions in
them; But you are to seek out for other (and more suitable) promi∣ses,
which are absolute and without condition.</HI> It is worth asking
where those suitable promises are to a man void of faith? For
that before by the Authour was mentioned, or to a man impenient,
and not so much as hungring after them, such a one I meane,
that upon good grounds, is able to charge the want of these up∣on
his soul, I am sure they are under heavy Scripture-woes, even
Gospel-menaces, and can they at the same time be fitted to re∣ceive
the mercy of a promise? Where are his promises that hun∣gers
and thirsts not, when Christ saith, <HI>Wo to you that are full,
for you shall hunger?</HI> Where is his promise that mourns not, but
goes on frolick in his way, When Christ saith, <HI>Woe unto you
that laugh now, for ye shall weep and lament,</HI> Luke 6. 25. Where is
the unbeleevers promise, when the Lord sayes, <HI>He that be∣leeveth
not, is condemned, already; because he hath not beleeved in the
name of the only begotten Son of God,</HI> John 3. 18. Where is the im∣penitent
mans promise, when the <HI>Psalmist</HI> saith, <HI>The wicked
<PB N="191" REF="113"/>
shall be turned into hell,</HI> Psalme 9. 17. and the Apostle, <HI>That no un∣righteous
person shall enter into the Kingdome of heaven,</HI> 1 Cor. 6. 9.
But instance is given, <HI>Isa. 43. 25. I am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own name sake.</HI> But this is not the unbe∣leeving,
the impenitent mans transgressions, they still stand on
record, and the bond uncancelled. This excludes motives from
us, not graces wrought in us, when God justifies a beleever, it's
for his own name sake, or else he is a loser in his glory, when <HI>he
justifies those that beleeve in Jesus,</HI> Rom. 3. 26. and Faith gives not
glory to God, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 20. but takes glory from him. As
<HI>Peter</HI> said of the creeple that was cured; <HI>His name, through faith
in his name, hath made this man strong,</HI> Acts 3. 16. So we may say
of every sinner, justified and pardoned, <HI>His Name, through faith
in his Name,</HI> hath acquit and freed him. When God pardons a
penitent man, it is not for the merit of his returne that he par∣dons
him; if this were so, <HI>Peter</HI> who is so zealous, to advance his
name in the place quoted; had not presently urged; <HI>Repent and
be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of re∣freshing
shall come from the presence of the Lord,</HI> Acts 3. 19. It is not
for his honour to pardon any other. This is with him a rule which
he will for ever follow, <HI>Those that honour me, I will honour, and
they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed,</HI> 1 Sam. 3. 30. The
same Author saith, <HI>Conditions and qualifications are mentioned in
some promises;</HI> and therefore we may safely inferre, are under∣stood
in all promises of life and salvation, unlesse God deny
himself, He hath threatned death and condemnation against an
unqualified man; namely the unbeleeving and impenitent; and
therefore hath not promised them life and salvation. Beleeving
penitent ones, have the promises of life to be made good to them,
exclusively to all others. To lead the sinner to Christ for the gain∣ing
of the qualifications of grace in the way of his Ordinances,
is to lead him right; He is the Author of our faith, and he is a
Prince to give repentance. But to perswade a sinner to look for
life, in the want of all these, or to tell him of Assurance of
life without sense of these, is to deceive him. That happy Doctrine
of free grace, so timely abused, even as soon as clearly preached,
is now no lesse abused; Then, inferences were made from it, for
encouragement to abound in sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 1. Now inferences are
drawn to cry down duty, Righteousnesse imputed must overthrow
<PB N="192" REF="114"/>
righteousnesse inherent. The Apostle would not suffer the former;
the Ministers of Christ must not bear the latter.</P>

<P>HEnce farther follows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The evil of breach of Co∣venant with man.</NOTE> that all people in covenant must
come up to the termes and propositions of the covenant,
Entring covenant they must see that their hearts art upright in it.
How do we aggravate their wickednesse, and hold in detestation
all those persons that break covenant with men, that having past a
promise, (especially having put upon it the sanction of an Oath)
yet violate and transgresse it. These first involve themselves in
the guilt of lying, which every where in Scripture is followed with
judgements, an Art which they learne of the Devil, who is a
liar, and the father of lies, <HI>John</HI> 8. 44. And therefore with him
have their doome in the lake that burnes with fire and brimstome,
<HI>Revel.</HI> 21. 8. Secondly, in the pollution of Gods Name, which
we should have in fear and dread, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 5, 8. Taking it
in vaine, in falsehood, and deceit into their mouths, endeavouring
to bring in that God, whom they pretend to serve; in whom is
all their expectation, as a party in their falsehood, and ungodli∣nesse.
This high crime is charged upon <HI>Israel</HI> in taking to them∣selves
again those servants that according to covenant they had
dismissed, <HI>Jerem. 34. 15, 16. Ye turned and polluted my name,
and caused every man his servaut, and every man his handmaid, whom
he had set at liberty, at their pleasure to returne, and brought them
into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids;</HI> Therein
is the overthrow of all bonds of humane society, of all converse
and commerce, whether in more publick, or private negotiations.
Truth is the upholding, and perfidiousnesse is the bane and utter
destruction of it. When Papists have maintained that <HI>Faith,</HI> or
<HI>covenant</HI> is not to be kept with Hereticks; reformed Churches
have concluded upon it, that there is no safety of any, league or
<PB N="193" REF="114"/>
intercourse of dealing with them. The example of <HI>John Husse</HI> is
a sufficient warning. Those that hold no such principles, yet be∣ing
such in their practices; are equally dangerous. We look
upon these, as given up to a very Spirit of Atheism, if not wholly
in their judgements to deny a Deity, and to utter with their
mouths that which the Psalmists foole sayes in his heart, yet
utterly slighting his Sovereignty, and disregarding his judge∣ments.
They have arrived at that dedolency that the Apostle
mentions, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. 19. and therefore rankt by him with the
worst of Heathens, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 31. and put into that black bill of un∣godly
persons, that will be found in the last and most perillous
times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach of Co∣venant with God, is a great∣er evil.</NOTE> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 3. How much more then will God and man have
in detestation those; that have entred covenant in an immediate
way with God, for faith and obedience and to stand out in oppo∣sition
to sinne, and Satan, yet (making defection from God by
sinne and unbeliefe) stand up in rebellion against him. Is the
dreadful Majesty of the great God of no more regard, than to
pretend to him, engage with him, and then stand up in hostility
against him? Is there any thing so lovely, or honourable in sin,
to allure men to run upon the wrath of God, that they may welter
in it? or any thing so unpleasing in the wayes of God, that nei∣ther
the dread of his name, nor the blisse, held forth in promise,
can perswade to embrace them? A viler thing cannot be named,
than a Christian in sinne, a Christian in wayes of unbeliefe and
wickednesse. Were the name of a Christian off, and no cove∣nant
bonds engaging to the Lord; then there were no more than
a creature in rebellion, and that were bad enough, the work of
Gods hand to strive with its Maker. But standing vested in this
covenant-relation, honoured with this glorious Name, here is
an addition of Hypocrisie, Apostasie and defection. We hate
none more than those that are false to us; and we may well con∣clude
that God hates none more than those that are false to him,
and therefore challenges his people, whether they have found
any iniquity in him, <HI>Jerem. 2 5. What iniquity have your fathers
found in me, that they are gone farre from me, and have walked af∣ter
vanity, and are become vain?</HI> A servant doth not use to quit one
Master, and betake himself to another, but he gives some reason
of his change. One that hath been engaged for the ways of God
(as all are that are called by the Name of God, and dignified
<PB N="194" REF="115"/>
with the title of a Christian) would be hard put to it, to give a
reason of his revolt from God. When God and vanity are set
in competition, that God should be refused, and vanity
chosen, when the fountaine of living waters, that never can
be drawn dry, is left, and cisternes, broken cisternes chosen,
that are alwayes running dry. How does the holy Ghost, set out
these, 2 <HI>Pet. 2. 22. The dog is turned to his own vomit again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and the
sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</HI> Can the sow find no
other place than filth? nor the dogge no other food than his
vomit? A returne to sinne is more loathsome than these, and
such are all the wayes of all men in sinne, of all of a Christian
profession, that are seen in ungodly ways; Nothing so glorious as
a Christian that holds to his principles, that answers in conver∣sation
to his profession, Nothing so inglorious as a Christian in sin.
A Jew outwardly, and a Heathen inwardly, a face for God, and
a heart for iniquity. When such as these came out of the holy
land for <HI>Babylon,</HI> they, there said in way of reproach of their
God, <HI>These are the people of the Lord, and are gone forth out of
his land,</HI> Ezek. 36. 20. Rom. 2. 24. Insomuch that God is put to it
for his vindication, not to suffer them to carry their sin with impu∣nity,
<HI>Ezek. 39. 23, 24. And the heathen shall know, that the house of</HI>
Israel <HI>went into captivity for their iniquity, because they trespassed a∣gainst
me; therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the
hand of their enemies; so fell they all by the sword according to their
uncleannesse, and according to their transgressions have I done unto
them, and hid my face from them.</HI> This falsehood in covenant
draws present sufferings, National plagues: <HI>I will bring a sword
upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant,</HI> Levit. 26. 25.
Every Christian Nation under sufferings;<NOTE PLACE="marg">It brings Na∣tional plagues.</NOTE> may sadly reflect upon
all that they groan under, and say their iniquities have procured
these things unto them.</P>
<P>But this breach of covenant with God hath greater evils, even
unto eternity following upon it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">It brings evil to eternity.</NOTE> Men of sinne and unbeliefe, that
lie in distrust and disobedience, can claime no interest in the grace
and mercy of the covenant. God in covenant engages to Faith
and Repentance, these as we have seen are his termes, when men
come not up to them, they dis-interest themselves, and disengage
God from any tye of conferring blisse and savation upon them.
Their own folly and madnesse, puts a barre to their own happi∣nesse
<PB N="195" REF="115"/>
and glory. They cannot be self-saviours, yet they will
not go out of themselves for salvation by another, when they
have received the sentence of death in themselves, they will not
come to Christ, that they may have life. He may worthily bear
his own debt, that in pride of spirit, refuses anothers bounty;
Christ offers himself as a Surety in our stead, to make payment for
us in his own person. The unbeleever will stand on his owu
bottome, and make pay out of his own store, or perish; Having
heaven and hell set before them; the tender of the one, and the
terrour of the other, quitting heaven and all the glory of it, and
happinesse in it; they make choice of that fire, that is prepared
for the Devil and his Angels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Assurance of happinesse, but in per∣formance of the termes of the Covenant.</NOTE> covenant-breaking having the cer∣taine
doome of destruction fastened upon it. Assurance of sal∣vation
cannot be gained, but in a way of covenant-keeping; yea,
the conditions of the covenant are the basis, and never failing
bottome of our Evidence and Assurance. It is gathered thus: <HI>He
that believes and repents, shall be saved.</HI> This is evidently laid down
in Scriptures; A man void of saving faith, and impenitent, may
give his assent to it. Then the sould is to assume to it selfe, <HI>but
I beleeve and repent, therefore I shall be saved.</HI> These two (as at
large hath been shewn) are the conditions of the covenant; these
we must finde wrought in our souls, or else all Evidence is wanting,
and when these are concluded, an undeceiving interest in salvation
follows.</P>
<P>There is a twofold work to be done on the soul that is in sin in
order to bring it to salvation; There is a third to be done for assu∣rance
of salvation.</P>
<P>The first work is to set the soul free from Hell, to deliver it from
the sentence of Death; to which by the rule of justice, man stands
condemned. A man must be fetched out of prison, before he
can be for any preferment, or place of honour. This is done by
the blood of Christ, <HI>Ephes. 1. 7. In whom we have redemption
through his blood, the forgivenesse of sinnes, according to the riches of
his grace.</HI> This is the price of our ransom, <HI>Being redeemed, not
with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood
of Christ,</HI> 1 Pet. 1 18.</P>
<P>Secondly, to make a man meet for heaven, A man so vile as
sinne makes, is a man fit for nothing but hell, and must have a
change wrought before he be meet for heaven. Upon this ground
<PB N="196" REF="116"/>
the Apostle is so large, in returning praise for the <HI>Colossians: Gi∣ving
thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of
the inheritance of the Saints in light,</HI> Col. 1. 12. As alone, the blood
of Christ sets free from hell; so alone, the Spirit of Christ makes
fit for heaven. This is done by a double work. 1. Of regenera∣tion
or first implantation of grace, which is called the birth of the
Spirit, <HI>John</HI> 3. 5, 6. 2. By acting, improving, carrying on this
work of grace; which is properly sanctification, so that when
the Spirit is gone thus farre, here is a certainty of the object. It is
sure, nothing more sure than this; that a regenerate sanctified man
shall be saved. But here is more required for a certainty of the
subject. Here is <HI>certitudo de re;</HI> but more is required to attaine
<HI>certitudinem de se.</HI> If <HI>Peter</HI> do beleeve and repent, he shall be sa∣ved,
is out of controversie; But that <HI>Peter</HI> doth beleeve and re∣pent,
is not alwayes so soone discovered, And this is the Spirits
work as the former It is not my businesse now to hold out what
is the Spirits whole office in concluding our Assurance, but to shew
that the conditions of the covenant are the bottom ground, not
of salvation, but of our evidence of interest in salvation. We must
know that we do beleeve and repent, before we have assurance,
and we must first beleeve and repent, before we know that we be∣leeve
and repent. If before faith and repentance there can be no
salvation; then before we know we beleeve and repent, we can∣not
be assured of salvation: But without faith and repentance
there is no salvation, <HI>Mark 16. 16. He that beleeveth and is
baptized, shall be saved; but he that beleeveth not, shall be damned.</HI>
Luke 13. 3. 5. <HI>I tell you, may, but except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish;</HI> Therefore before we beleeve and repent, we can∣not
be assured of salvation. And how assurance can be gained
without a practical syllogisme, and how a syllogisme can be fra∣med
with any other <HI>medium,</HI> than the conditions of the covenant,
is above my understanding Man is so far from abilities to conclude
salvation, without faith and repentance, that be must conclude him∣self
to be in faith, and that he doth repent, before he can conclude
any interest in it. The covenant of God is the ground of our
salvation; if that be waved, all is lost, and we must make good
our part in the Covenant, Grace must assist to answer what
the covenant requires, or no salvation. How is it a covenant,
if nothing be required? and why is it required, if it must
<PB N="197" REF="116"/>
not be performed? To gather up assurance from the conditions
of the covenant is a businesse of greater consequence, even the
highest pitch of Christianity. It is a great work to beleeve and re∣pent,
a greater work to know that we savingly beleeve and repent.
The work it selfe is difficult, no businesse of a lazy soul, but
to know, that the work is aright done, is a greater difficulty; but
that it must be gathered from the conditions, is easie to resolve.
I know some finding the seal of the Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The office of the Spirit in the work of Assurance.</NOTE> and the witnesse of
the Spirit mentioned in Scripture in order to assurance, will
have the whole of the work of Assurance to be carryed on
alone by the Spirit, and that all is done in us without us.
They expect a secret whisper from God, that we are Gods,
and no more. This witnesse, they say, must be heeded,
and our faith and repentance in the work not at all regarded,
But I would know of those if the Spirit be a seale; whether
the soul doth not bear the impresse? and what this impresse
is, but the graces of the Spirit? The Seale sealing, and
the impresse made, fully answer one the other, Sometimes it
may dimmely answer, where the wax or clay, (or whatso∣ever
is sealed) takes not a full impression; but if it answer
not, it is no Seale. The graces that the Spirit works, are its
impresse▪ and these are the conditions of the covenant, and so
instead of an objection, we have a proofe. For the witnesse of
the Spirit, I desire to know whether it be a single witnesse, gi∣ving
testimony to us without us, or a witnesse concurring with
our spirits? The Text is cleare, <HI>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it self
beareth witnesse with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</HI>
Our spirits bearing witnesse, are our consciences, <HI>Rom. 2. 5.
Their consciences also bearing them witnesse;</HI> and therefore Master
<HI>Baxter</HI> rightly affirmes, <HI>That the testimony of the Spirit, and the
testimony of our consciences are two concurrent testimonies, or causes,
to produce one and the same effect.</HI> But every conscience cannot
witnesse thus with the Spirit, or joyne in a concurrent testi∣mony.
It <HI>is the witnesse of a good conscience,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 21. <HI>Baptism
saves</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>by the resurrection of Christ;</HI> Explaining
himself, <HI>not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</HI> not the bare
outward act of administration (which is worthily set out by
the most undervaluing termes, when it is put in opposition to the
inward work) <HI>but the answer of a good conscience towards God.</HI> Ba∣ptisme
<PB N="198" REF="117"/>
is a seal of the covenant, and it engages to what the
covenant requires, which (as we have been still catechized) <HI>is to
beleeve in God, and to forsake our sins,</HI> and when conscience answers
that this is done, Baptisme is a seale that Christ saves. The seale
of the Spirit is an impresse of those graces; and the witnesse
of the Spirit is a clearingup of these graces, and giving in te∣stimony
to the truth of them, opening our eyes to read the
characters, which it selfe hath made, 1 <HI>Corinth. 2. 12. We
have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which
is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to
us of God.</HI> So that in vaine do men talk of the Spirit; that
have not on their own hearts the impresse of it, or of the wit∣nesse
of the Spirit, when a renewed conscience cannot con∣curre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The immediate teste of the Spirits exami∣ned.</NOTE>
in testimony that these engagements are answered in
faith and repentance; let that Text of the Apostle be con∣sidered,
1 <HI>John 3. 24. He that keepeth his commandments, dwel∣leth
in him, and he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth
in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</HI> I know there are
some that admit of all this, and freely yeeld, that this is a safe
way to conclude Assurance from Sanctification, Confessing
that the Spirit never witnesseth with an unsanctified
heart, yet they contend for a farther and immediate teste of
the Spirit, without any consideration had, of inherent gra∣ces
wrought, or any reflection made, by the the soule upon
it selfe, in review of any gracious qualifications. Yet here they
confesse danger; and limit this doctrine of theirs with diverse
cautions, as I have met with some, from an eminent hand, in a
manuscript. 1. <HI>This is extraordinary</HI> (as they say) <HI>very seldome
seene or known, it is no common way of the Spirits wit∣nesse.
2. It is for the most part in, or upon performance of
some duties, or conscientious employment of a mans selfe in the
way of his calling. 3. After some great abasement of a mans
spirit, and more than ordinary soul-humiliations and self-denials.
4. After some great adventures made for God, and the advance∣ment
of his Name. 5. After some great combate, and conflict
with temptation, in which God gives in his Spirit, as an</HI> honorarium,
<HI>or glorious reward upon victory obtained.</HI> First, by way of con∣cession,
it is not to be denied, that God in a more than or∣dinary
measure, doth many times manifest the gift of his Spi∣rit
<PB N="199" REF="117"/>
for this work of Assurance, and that upon these occasions
here laid down, the soule hath many cheering consolations
nigh unto raptures. The Spouse hath not like converse with
the Bridegroome at all times; Sometimes she <HI>walks with him
in the Galleries;</HI> Sometimes she <HI>is with him in the wine-sellers;</HI> Some∣times
she can say in a way of exultation, <HI>My beloved is mine, and
I am his.</HI> But these limits in the instances before laid down, seem
to me to be a full denial, instead of proof, that it is thus imme∣diate,
without all reflex upon our graces. These being means san∣ctified
of God, to stir up the habit of grace by his Spirit wrought
within us, and to bring them forth into action, which God
then farther honours with a greater measure of light, to discerne
his own work wrought in us. Our spirits being got into such a
posture, are in an aptitude to witnesse with us; and God is
then pleased, to come in by his Spirit, to joyn in Evidence; So that
still the conditional promises, are not only a safe, but the alone
way, in which through the help of the Spirit we get Assurance
that we shall be saved. They that go about to assert an imme∣diate
teste, will never secure the soule from delusion, Satan
will soon finde an artifice, to counterfeit this testimony, and bear
witnesse, in the Spirits stead, and when we think we have the Spirit
of truth to assure, we shall have the father of lies to deceive. A
gappe will be opened to all licentious presumption, <HI>Children of
disobedience</HI> will soone heed <HI>vain words,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>that the wrath of God shall
not come upon them;</HI> Neither will it be to purpose to demand, how
the Prophets were assured that it was the word of the Lord that
came to them, and no delusion, and to affirme that the same way
we have assurance of the truth of the Spirits witnesse, seeing
Gods extraordinary way of discovery of himself in visions, dreams,
or what other way himself pleased to chuse, is not the same with
his ordinary way of discovery unto us, we no more understand that
way of discovery than we do the way in which by power received,
they wrought miracles. As for Doctrines, which men are apt to
obtrude upon the Spirit; so, for testimonies, in order to our adopti∣on
and salvation, we must go <HI>to the Law, and to the Testimony.</HI>
The Law and Testimony lead us, for Assurance to our own hearts,
excusing or condemning in the particulars mentioned; <HI>And if
our hearts condemne us not, then have we confidence towards God;
and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his com∣mandments,
<PB N="200" REF="118"/>
and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And
this is his Commandment, that we should beleeve on the Name of his
Son Jesus-Christ, and love one another as he gave us commandment,
1 John</HI> 3. 21, 22, 23. And if the stresse of all had not lien here,
Christ had never compared the Professor, that hears and does not,
to the foolish builder that raises his hopes of salvation on a san∣dy
foundation, upon a bare title of an empty profession, without
any well grounded interest, and the Professor that heares and
does, to the man that builds on a rock, and so layes his hopes
of salvation on a foundation, that never will deceive: Nei∣ther
would the Psalmist have concluded that, <HI>he shall not be
ashamed,</HI> (his hope would not make him ashamed) <HI>when
he had respect unto all Gods Commandments,</HI> Psalme 119. 6. And
howsoever our doing does nothing by way of merit; yet our
doing through grace (in which beleeving is comprized,
which is the command of God, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3. 23.) does all; taking
in the Spirits help to cleare the integrity of these works, by
way of Assurance. And though it be no foundation of our
subsistence in grace; and therefore the Apostle durst not rest
on that bottome, nor will be found in his own righteousnesse;
yet it is the foundation of our evidence. The Apostle gives
it in command to <HI>Timothy, Charge them that are rich in this
world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertaine
riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distri∣bute,
willing to communicate,</HI> giving this in as the end of all,
<HI>Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time
to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life,</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18,
19. God hath <HI>ordained these, that we should walk in them,</HI>
Ephes. 2. 10. and walking in them; we are pronounced bles∣sed,
<HI>Psalme</HI> 11 9. 1, 2. The efficient cause of our happinesse
is grace, the free favour and good will of God towards man,
<HI>Being justified freely by his grace,</HI> Rom. 3. 24. The for∣mal
cause, is, the imputation of Christs righteousnesse with∣out
ours, when we fall short of the righteousnesse of the
Law; <HI>Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnesse,</HI> Rom. 10.
3. Therefore the Apostle observes, that <HI>David describes the bles∣sednesse
of the man to whom the Lord imputeth righteousnesse without
works,</HI> (that is, wherein his blessednesse doth consist,) <HI>saying▪
<PB N="201" REF="118"/>
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sinnes are
covered; Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin,</HI> Rom.
4. 6, 7, 8. The instrument or hand applying, is Faith: <HI>Being justi∣fied
freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ,
whom God hath set forth for propitiation through faith in his blood,
Rom.</HI> 3. 24, 25. But the subject on whom this blessednesse rests,
is the godly righteous man: <HI>The Lord hath set apart him that is
godly for himself,</HI> Psalme 4. 3. <HI>The man that hath clean hands, and
a pure heart, who hath not lift up his soul unto vanity, nor sworne de∣ceitfully;
he shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness
from the God of his salvation,</HI> Psal. 24. 4, 5. There is a concurrence
of sundry causes in mans happinesse, but all falls upon the head
of him that is stedfast with God in covenant, that comes up to
the termes and conditions of it. He is pronounced, and shall re∣maine
for ever blessed, <HI>and without holinesse no man shall see the
Lord.</HI> It is questioned by some, whether it be the truth, or the
degree of these graces, which are conditions of the Gospel cove∣nant,
upon performance of which we may conclude our Assu∣rance
of happinesse; but the determination of that (being thus
put) is easie, No man in true grace shall go to hell, or misse of
heaven, God doth not adorne man with that glory to reject him.
The Apostle exhorts <HI>to love, not in word, nor in tongue, but in deed
and in truth;</HI> and for a motive adds; <HI>Hereby we know that we are
of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him,</HI> 1 Joh. 3. 18, 19.
But the <HI>minimum quod sic,</HI> when it is that grace may be accounted
true, is not so easie, to determine. It is not every faintish de∣sire
that is the work on which all this glory rests. It must be a
work of farther power and efficacy on the soul, for satisfaction
of which I shall referre the Reader to the learned labours of my
much honoured neighbour, Master <HI>Anthony Burgesse</HI> in his

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The distribution of the Covenant of Grace into the Old and
New Covenant with the harmony and agreement that
is found between them.</HEAD>
<P>BY Gods assistance we have been thus farre carried on in the
work in hand, to finde out the nature of a covenant, and
Gods way of entring covenant with man. And for the more
clear discovery of both, we have held forth the agreement which
is found, between the covenant of Works; which God entred with
man in his state of integrity; and the covenant of Grace entred
of God with man, in his fallen condition, as also their respective
differences, So that all that is essential in this covenant, (and
necessarily required to the attainment of the priviledges and mer∣cies
promised in it) hath been made known, and a compleat de∣finition
given, with such corolaries and inferences that have been
judged necessary.</P>
<P>Now this covenant thus entred with man in his lapsed estate,
and hitherto cleared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Old and New Covenant</NOTE> admits of distinction; and is distinguished in
Scripture by the names of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Covenant,</HI> Heb. 8. 13.
<HI>The first and second covenant,</HI> Heb. 8. 7. The first some call, and not
unfitly, a covenant of Promise; under that covenant Christ was
known in promises only, and not manifested in the flesh; Others call
it a subservient covenant, being to lead in the second, in its full
lustre and glory, which alone they call a covenant of Grace, and
make it a third covenant But I shall content my self with the Scri∣pture-termes,
calling the first, <HI>Old,</HI> not because it was first in being;
but because it is to be abolished, and another to succeed, the later
<HI>New,</HI> because it is never to be antiquated, as the Apostle, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.
13. explains himself. Now, it must needs contribute much to the
clear understanding of the covenant; as well of the termes of it, as
the mercies in it and be a great advantage for the better under∣standing
of sundry, both Old and New Testament-Scripture; in case
the agreement between this Old and New covenant, together
with their true differences be rightly assigned, and those ima∣ginary
differences assigned by some (erroneous on either hand
<PB N="203" REF="119"/>
to the great prejudice of either of the covenants) be throughly
examined.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The method followed in the ensuing part of the Treatise.</NOTE> A work of difficulty, but (were it well followed) of
singular profit. On this by the help of Gods grace I shall adven∣ture,
and in the first place lay down their agreement, afterwards
their respective true and real differences, and then proceed to exa∣mination
of such differences which some have assigned, which I re∣serve
to the last place, seeing in the two first I shall be brief. The
last will be found a businesse full of tedious difficulty, and trouble.
In several things there is a full agreement between these cove∣nants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agreement be∣tween the Old and New co∣venant in six particulars.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. <HI>In the Authour propounding,</HI> God is the Authour of them both;
God is <HI>the God, not of the Jews only,</HI> (who were in the first cove∣nant)
<HI>but of the Gentiles also,</HI> taken through grace into the second
covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 29.</P>
<P>2. <HI>In the party accepting,</HI> as specifically considered, they are both
entred with man; Neither Angels, nor any other creature articles,
or is articled with in it; and hitherto there is an agreement of both
with the covenant of works.</P>
<P>3. <HI>In the motive or impulsive cause;</HI> Both of these are of singular
grace, entred with fallen man in his lost condition; there was
no hint of this grace before the fall, nor any need, or use of it, being
not for mans preservation, but his restitution.</P>
<P>4. <HI>In the Mediatour Christ Jesus,</HI> who was one and the same
in both: For though <HI>Moses</HI> have the name of Mediatour, <HI>Gal.

Acts 17. 38. as the Judges in <HI>Israel</HI> had the name of <HI>Saviours,
Nehem.</HI> 9. 27. and thereupon <HI>Camero</HI> makes this difference be∣tween
the Old and the New covenant, <HI>That Moses was Media∣tour
in one, Christ in the other,</HI> Thes. 68. yet he confesses,
that <HI>that mediation, by the benefit whereof men are truly and effectu∣ally
united to God, belongs only unto Christ. De trip. foedere. Thes.
Moses</HI> work was only to deliver the way of the worship of God
in those times, and that not in his own name, but <HI>as a servant,
Heb.</HI> 3. 5. He that <HI>Moses</HI> did serve, of whom he wrote, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5. 46.
that Prophet like unto <HI>Moses,</HI> whom God promised to raise, <HI>Deut.</HI>
18. 15. in all ages was Mediatour.</P>
<P>5. <HI>They agree</HI> in the conditions annext. <HI>Both these covenants
have one, and the same conditions, on Gods part, Remission of sins,
and everlasting happinesse, as after shall be shewed more fully;
<PB N="204" REF="120"/>
They are the same on mans part, Faith and Repentance.</HI> The just
<HI>then</HI> did live by faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 4. And without faith it was then impos∣sible
to please God, <HI>Heb. 11. 6. Acts</HI> 10. 43. To him give all the
Prophets witnesse, that through his name, whosoever beleeveth in him
shall receive remission of sins. <HI>God then called for returne to him∣self,
and sincerity in our returnes, accepting those that were sin∣cere,</HI>
Ezek. 18. 31. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the
whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of those whose hearts
are perfect before him, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 26. 9.</P>
<P>6. <HI>They agree in the unity of Church-felloship, constituting one
and the same Church of Christ.</HI> The Church in those dayes in which
the Fathers lived, is one and the same Church with this in Gospel-times.
In Gospel-times men come from the East, and West, and
sit down with <HI>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdome of heaven,</HI>
Matth. 8. 11. One and the same Kingdome receives both. Their
Faith was terminated upon Christ as well as ours; <HI>Abraham saw
his day and rejoyced,</HI> John 8. 56. <HI>Moses</HI> bore his reproach, <HI>and
esteemed it greater then the treasures in Egypt,</HI> Heb. 11. 26. <HI>They
did eat the same spiritual meat, and did drink the same spiritual drink;
they drank of the Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ,</HI>
1 Cor. 10. 3. The same, not among themselves, but the same with
us. They are saved by the same free grace and mercy as we;
<HI>Jews by nature,</HI> are justified by the same faith in Jesus, <HI>as sinners
of the Gentiles,</HI> Gal. 2. 15, 16. All these identities evidence one
and the same Church, ours and theirs; <HI>Therefore say I unto you,
the Kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation
bringing forth the fruits thereof,</HI> Matth. 21. 43. The same Kingdom
was taken from them and given to us, was taken from the Jewes,
and given to the Gentiles; where <HI>Sem</HI> left, there <HI>Japhet</HI> took pos∣session,
<HI>Gen. 9. 27. Sems</HI> Tents are <HI>Japhets.</HI> These speak the cove∣nants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Old and New Cove∣nant in sub∣stance one.</NOTE>
into which we have successively entred, to be one and
the same in substance. A covenant entred by the same parties,
upon the same termes and propositions on either hand, is the same
covenant; Such is the Old covenant entred with the Jewes, and
the New covenant entred with Christians, they are therefore one
and the same in substance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Differences assigned between the Old and New covenant.</HEAD>
<P>THese covenants, are not in that manner, fully and entirely one,
but there is difference in the way of administration. They
are one in substance, constituting one Church, one Kingdome; but
different in circumstances. Upon which account, they are distin∣guished,
by the names of the <HI>Old and New, the first and second
Covenant.</HI> Some have made it their ambition to rise as high as
may be, in the number of differences, and have assigned several,
where there is a full accord and perfect agreement: I shall lay
down such where the difference is clear; and afterward take view,
of those imaginary differences upon which any controversie of
moment hangs.</P>
<P>1. They differ <HI>in the agents employed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences between the Old and New Covenant.</NOTE> <HI>in administration of these
respective covenants entred of God, and upheld and continued with
his people.</HI> The Old covenant was administred and held forth by
Servants only, Prophets, Priests, and such as God pleased to
appoint, whether by ordinary call, as those of the Tribe of <HI>Levi,
who were appointed among men in things appertaining to God.</HI> Or, ex∣traordinary,
to whom he spake in visions and dreams; <HI>God in sun∣dry
wayes and manners</HI> (as the Apostle to the Hebrews observes)
<HI>then speaking to his people,</HI> Heb. 1. 1. The New covenant is held
forth by the Son, as in the same place the Apostle witnesseth. He
was the Angel or Messenger of the covenant, Upon that errand
he came from the Father, clothed with our flesh. This is <HI>that
great salvation, which first began to be spoken to us by the Lord,</HI> Heb.
2. 3. And this he carries on, by his delegates and deputies,
whom from the right hand of the Father he gifts and
qualifies.</P>
<P>2. They differ <HI>in their extent and latitude, as to the Nations ta∣ken
into covenant.</HI> The Old covenant received only the Jews; To
them appertained <HI>the Adoption, the Glory, and the Covenants,</HI> Rom.
9. 4. Circumcision, the Seale of the covenant, was proper to
them, with some few of other Nations, that forgetting their own
people, and their fathers house, joyned themseves to them,
<PB N="206" REF="121"/>
whilest other Nations were known by the name of uncircumcision
being without title to that Seale; and were <HI>without Christ, aliens
to the common-wealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of
Promise,</HI> Eph. 2. 12. Therefore the Apostles, before the vaile was
taken away, had that restraint upon them, <HI>Matth. 10. 5. Go not
into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans
enter ye not.</HI> The lost sheep of the house of <HI>Israel</HI> (being in covenant)
onely were in their commission. That was a <HI>valley of vision,</HI>
All other people were in darknesse. They <HI>were a people of God,</HI> O∣thers
were <HI>no people.</HI> The New covenant takes in all Nations, re∣spective
to the covenant, no Nation hath any barre put to it,
<HI>but in every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh righteousnesse,
is accepted with him,</HI> Act. 10. 35. Christ having taken away the
partition wall; the Apostles have a commission for the discipling
of all Nations, so that in <HI>Christ Jesus, There is neither Jew nor Greek,
Scythian nor Barbarian,</HI> Col. 3. 11.</P>
<P>3. They differ <HI>in their duration or continuance.</HI> The Old co∣venant
had but its date of time, which being expired, it must
give way for the New to succeed. Thus the Apostle reasons from
the Prophets prediction, of a New covenant, <HI>Heb. 8. 13. In that
he saith, A New covenant, he hath made void the Old; now that
which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vanish away.</HI> This was
to stand <HI>till times of reformation,</HI> Heb. 9 10. This second cove∣nant must remaine till the end of time. These are called the
last dayes, in that, after these there must be no change of Ordi∣nances.
The Ministery now established, is to remaine to the end
of the world, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 20. and the Sacraments, until Christs
second coming unto judgement.</P>
<P>4. They differ <HI>in the way of dedication or consecration.</HI> The Old
covenant was dedicated, and purified with the blood of Bulls and
Goats, and other Sacrifices, which according to the Law were
slaine and offered, as the Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> observes from
<HI>Exod. 24. 7, 8. Heb. 9. 19, 20, 21. When</HI> Moses <HI>had spoken every
precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves
and goats, with water and Scarlet-wool and hysope, and sprinkled
both the book and all the people; saying, This is the blood of the Testa∣ment
which God hath enjoyned you. Moreover, he sprinkled with
blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the Ministery</HI> But
in the New Testament, the dedication is in the blood of Christ.
<PB N="207" REF="121"/>
<HI>This is my blood in the New Testament shed for you, and for many
for the remission of sins:</HI> Where we see, 1. An agreement, Either of
both are Testaments and covenants, Either of both have their de∣dication,
Either of both are dedicated in blood; 2. An answer∣able
difference and opposition. The first was the Old Testa∣ment
to be antiquated. The second the New, to succeed in place
of the Old. The first was dedicated in the blood of Bulls and
Calves. The second in the blood of the Mediatour; <HI>in my blood,</HI>
saith Christ. The first had no possible power to take away sinne,
as the Apostle presently shews, <HI>chap. 10. 4. But this is shed for
many for the remission of sins.</HI> The Apostle in the words immediate∣ly
before these quoted, gives the covenant the name of a Testa∣ment,
though a covenant, and a mans last Will and Testament
really differ, seeing herein they agree, that the covenant had its va∣lidility,
as a Testament, by the death of him that made the cove∣nant,
<HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 16, 17.</P>
<P>5. They differ <HI>in the way of exhibition of Christ, the glory and
grace of the covenant,</HI> And upon a threefold account here, there
is a difference. 1. In the Old covenant we have Christ only in a
Promise; to be incarnate, to suffer, and to rise again, and to be
received unto glory. Under that covenant, light was by way of
prophecie; In the New covenant he is evidently set forth as come
in the flesh; Having been dead and now alive, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 18. Having
suffered in the flesh, risen again and entred into glory. To us, it
is not a prophecie, but a Gospel. 2. In the Old covenant, all was
held out to the people under types, figures, shadows; All
about the Tabernacle and Temple, Persons, U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensils, Sacrifices,
did lead to Christ; all of these, darkly holding him forth. <HI>They
had a shadow of good things to come, and not the image of the things
themselves,</HI> Heb. 10. 1. a little of reality in a great bulk of cere∣mony.
In the New Testament, the truth of it, is clearly, and ma∣nifestly
(without figure or type) held forth unto us. 3. In
the Old Testament, knowledge was dim and obscure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jews were in a state of light compara∣tive to Hea∣thens.</NOTE> It could
be no other, when it was wrapt up in prophecies and types.
A prophecie is a riddle till it be unfolden, and little is known
of a man by his shadow, comparative to that which is seen in
the man himselfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In a state of darkne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s com∣parative to Christi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns.</NOTE> Therefore though the state of the Jewes in
Old Testament times was a state of light, comparative to the
darknesse that was with other people, and their land was called
<PB N="208" REF="122"/>
<HI>a valley of visions,</HI> Isa. 22. 1. yet it was little more than dark∣nesse,
comparative to that light which in Gospel times is reveal∣ed.
Christ was a Minister of circumcision, and when he began
his Ministery in the land of <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Nepthali;</HI> the Text
says, <HI>The people that sate in darknesse saw a great light,</HI> Mat. 4. 16.
Circumcision therfore, in different respects, was both a Priviledge,
and a Bondage, A Priviledge, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 1. It was a great mercy to
have light let in at any crevice, promises any way sealed and rati∣fied
to us. A Bondage, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 10. To live in so dim a light, and
to be laden in so burdensome a way, was a heavy yoke; So that, as
the Apostle putting the question, <HI>What advantage the Jew had,
and what priviledge there was of circumcision,</HI> above and before the
Gentile? <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 1. answers, <HI>Much every way,</HI> and gives in his
reason of the preheminence; So, in case the question should be put
<HI>What advantage hath the Christian, and what priviledge there is of
Baptisme,</HI> above and before the Jew? Answer may be made Much
every way, and the reason given of the preheminence in Gospel-times,
in the particulars above mentioned; So that, the New co∣venant,
<HI>is a better covenant, established upon better promises,</HI> Heb.
8. 6. Promises are more full and clear. Though it must be confest,
that a Christians preheminence above the Iewes, doth not equal
a Iewes preheminence above the Gentile. The Iew was in co∣venant
with God, and was heire of the Promise. <HI>The Gentiles
were aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, strangers from the co∣venant
of Promise; having no hope, and without God in the world,</HI>
Ephes. 2. 12. The Iew was in the same covenant in his time, as
Christians are in Gospel-times. There is not a promise in the New
covenant, whether it be for priviledges, conferred upon us, or
graces wrought in us, but by the help of that light, we may finde
in the Old covenant, the same held out, as after will be more
clearly manifested. The betternesse is, in the greater ease being
freed from that bondage, of the ceremonial yoke, and in their
more distinct clearnesse. The glory of all, that the covenant doth
tender, being in so clear, and full a way held out in Gospel-times,
<HI>that he that is least in the Kingdom of God,</HI> under the glory of the
New Testament-revelation, <HI>is greater</HI> in the way of Gospel-My∣steries,
<HI>then John Baptist,</HI> who was the greatest of Prophets,
greater than a Prophet. Those Prophets that did foresee, and fore∣shew
the Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascension of Christ,
<PB N="209" REF="122"/>
the triumphant conquest of his enemies, his glory at the right hand
of his Father, the spreading of the Gospel, the call of the Gen∣tiles,
did not themselves see it; as now the meanest that are in
Christ do understand it, no more than they who now preach
through Christ the Resurrection of the dead, the everlasting blisse
of glorified Saints, in their eternal fruition of Gods presence, are
able to understand it in that measure, as the meanest that then shall
have the happinesse to enjoy it.</P>
<P>6. They differ <HI>in the Seales annext for either of their ratification
and confirmation;</HI> for howsoever they are of the same use, leading
to one, and the same thing signified, the Jewes had Christ in
their Sacraments, 1 <HI>Cor. 10. 4 1 Cor.</HI> 5. 7. and we have no more
in ours; yet they differ in the outward stamp or <HI>effigies,</HI> as I may
so speak, as well that, of initiation, as that of corroboration:
The initiating Sacrament of the Jewes (which gave them the de∣nomination
of the people of God) was that painful circumcision
in the flesh, <HI>signum vile, &amp; incivile,</HI> yet, those that would be the
Lords, did, and must submit unto it. All of <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed with
him, received that signe; And all of those, that with him would
joyne unto the Lord. This was to be the leading Sacrament; He
that was not circumcised in the flesh, might not eat of the Passe∣over,
<HI>Exod 12. 48. And when a stranger shall sojourne with thee,
and will keep the Passeover unto the Lord, let all his males be circum∣cised,
and then let him come neer and keep it; and he shall be as one
that is borne in the land, for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</HI>
A full Text against all that plead for unbaptized persons admis∣sion
to the Lords Table, God will not suffer that disorder,
that the leading Sacrament should come after. The initia∣ting
Sacrament with Christians is that of Baptisme, no sooner
was a man brought into covenant, but he was streight baptized;
assoon as he made profession, he had this sealing engaging signe,
the application of water, which is of an abstersive cleansing na∣ture,
implying our staine and guilt, and leading us thither, where
purification and freedome is found, the Spirit and blood of Jesus
Christ. The following Sacrament in the Old covenant, was that
of the Passeover; a Lamp without blemish to be eaten in the
place and way that God prescribed. That in the New Testa∣ment,
is the Supper of the Lord, in ordinary, common, useful, and
necessary elements, Bread and Wine, which are of a strengthning &amp;
<PB N="210" REF="123"/>
cheering nature, <HI>Ps.</HI> 104. 15. Implying our fainting, feeble estate,
our disconsolate and sad condition, and leading us, where we may
find both strength and consolation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Positions tending to clear the first covenant, under Old
Testament-dispensations.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I proceed to the examination of those supposed differ∣ences;
which some have brought in, to the prejudice of both
covenants; I shall lay down certain positions, to give some light
for the more clear understanding, especially of the Old covenant,
and to help us (if it may be) in our judgements of them
both; as well in their agreement, as their severall differ∣ences.</P>
<P><HI>First Position,</HI> God delivered unto <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise, not
only a Law or Rule of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moses</HI> delivered a Covenant from God to <HI>Israel</HI> in Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI></NOTE> but also a Covenant, (as was before shew∣ed;)
So, <HI>Moses</HI> in Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> delivered unto the people of the Jews,
not a Law or rule only, but a covenant likewise. <HI>This might be con∣firmed
at large, but that others have fully done it; and I know
not that there is any adversary that appears in it. The name of
a covenant is frequently given to it,</HI> Deut. 4. 13. He declared
unto you the covenant, which he commanded you to performe, even
ten Commandments. <HI>See</HI> 2 Kings 18. 12. 2 Chron. 6. 11. <HI>All the
essentials of a covenant before mentioned, Parties, Consent, Con∣ditions,
are found in it, as we may see in that one Text,</HI> Deut. 26.
17, 18. Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, to walk
in his wayes, and the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his pecu∣liar
people, as he hath promised thee. <HI>Yea, the solemnities of a cove∣nant,
as before hath been largely shewne, are found
in it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses</HI> delivered a Covenant of Grace to <HI>Israel</HI></NOTE> <HI>This covenant delivered by</HI> Moses <HI>to the people of</HI>
Israel, <HI>was a covenant of Grace, the same in substance with this, under
which, we live in Gospel-times.</HI> This is so largely proved to my
hand by Master <HI>Ball</HI> in his <HI>Treatise of the covenant,</HI> page 102,
103, 104. and Master <HI>Burges</HI> in his <HI>Vindiciae legis,</HI> page 224, 225.
<PB N="211" REF="123"/>
that I may spare my paines; yet in brief, That covenant which
teacheth Christ, in which men attaine salvation, that accepts
men upon repentance, in which there is pardon of sinne, and
in which the heart is circumcised of God; that is a covenant of
grace. One of these single will evince it, much more in their
joynt strength will they conclude it; But the covenant deliver∣ed
by <HI>Moses,</HI> was such a covenant. In that covenant Christ
was taught, <HI>John 5. 46, 47. Had ye beleved</HI> Moses, <HI>ye would
have beleeved me; but if ye beleeve not</HI> Moses, <HI>how will ye beleeve
my words?</HI> Whence the collection is plaine, Beleevers of
<HI>Moses,</HI> are Beleevers of <HI>Christ;</HI> and Rejecters of <HI>Moses,</HI> are
Rejecters of <HI>Christ:</HI> See <HI>Luke 24. 25, 26. with 44, 45, 46.
John 1. 45. Acts 26. 22, 23. Rom.</HI> 3. 21, 22. The Prophecies,
Promises, Types, Genealogies, Sacraments under that covenant
(whether ordinary or extraordinary) all held forth Christ as might
be easily shewn in their several particulars. In that covenant
the people of the Jews attained salvation, and were not only fed
with temporal Promises, and a covenant meerly carnal; not
looking above or beyond the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> as shall be shewen:
In this covenant men are accepted, and received into mercy and
favour upon repentance; <HI>When thou art in tribulation, and all
these things are come upon thee in the later dayes, if thou turn to the
Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient to his voice, (for the Lord thy
God is a merciful God) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee,
nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them,</HI>
Deut. 4. 30, 31. In this covenant there is pardon of sinne, (the
great priviledge of the New covenant, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 12.) The Lord
proclaimes himself to <HI>Moses; The Lord, the Lord God, merciful,
and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodnesse and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin,</HI>
Exod. 34. 6, 7. See Exod. 32. 31, 32. 2 Chron. 7. 14. Psal. 25. 11. Psal.
51. 12. 7. 9. 14. In this covenant the heart is circumcised (another
great priviledge of the New covenant, <HI>Heb. 8.) And the Lord thy
God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the
Lord thy God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ten Com∣mandments delivered by <HI>Moses.</HI> were of this Covenant of Grace.</NOTE> All of these, any of these hold out a covenant of
Grace.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the ten commandments, which are called the co∣venant
of God, <HI>Deut. 4. 13. 2 Chron.</HI> 6. 11. (all that <HI>Moses</HI> de∣livered
to <HI>Israel,</HI> being there epitomized) holds forth a covenant
<PB N="212" REF="124"/>
of Grace, and not of Works. This appears in the Preface, in∣timating,
Gods grace and goodnesse to that people, <HI>bringing
them out of the land of Egypt, and the house of Bondage.</HI> Which
deliverance had more in it than a bare temporal mercy; other∣wise
their passage through the red Sea could have been no Bap∣tisme
as the Apostle calls it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 1. Neither had it been
any act of justifying faith in <HI>Moses</HI> to observe the Passeover, which
yet the Apostle observes, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 28. Then their Rock and Manna
had been a <HI>viaticum</HI> in the way, but no Sacrament. There God
avoucheth himself to be the God of that people; <HI>I am the Lord
thy God,</HI> and he was a God in covenant to none of man-kinde
fallen, but by an act of grace. It appears in the first commandment,
where God requires them to accept him, and cleave unto him,
which cannot be done but through Christ. It appears in the se∣cond
commandment; in the preceptive part of it, which contains
the whole ceremonial Law, in which, pardon of sinne was found
through Christ. Thither Interpreters reduce all the Sacrifices,
Types, Sacraments of the Jewes. It appeares in the reasons an∣next
to that precept, which, as it threatens judgement on trans∣gressours
of the Law; so, mercy to those that observe it. Mercy
is an act of Grace, and not vouchsafed but in Christ. It appears
in the fifth commandment, in the promise there annext, and
fastened to it; So that this covenant (or this summe or epitome
of the covenant between God and his people) which was put
into the Arke, and the Mercy-seat or propitiatory set upon
it, in the most holy place, <HI>Exod.</HI> 26. 34. was a covenant of
Grace.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Being a Cove∣nant of Grace, it could by no means be a Covenant of Works.</NOTE> this covenant (delivered by <HI>Moses</HI> and epitomized
in the Decalogue) being a covenant of Grace, it could by no
meanes be, in the whole and entire nature of it, a covenant of
Works. This is plaine, God doth not at once, with the same
people enter covenant upon so opposite termes. These are
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, either of them destructive to the other, We may argue
concerning the covenant, as the Apostle doth concerning E∣lection,
<HI>If by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is
no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more grace, other∣wise
work is no more work.</HI> This I speak as for their sakes, that
make it a mixt covenant, such a one as <HI>Pauls</HI> adversaries preacht
in the Churches of <HI>Galatia;</HI> so also for their sakes, that assert it to
<PB N="213" REF="124"/>
be a covenant of Works, never undertaking any answer to
those arguments, which so clearly conclude it to be a covenant of
Grace.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What this Co∣venant is to any, it is to all.</NOTE> <HI>What this covenant is to any, that it is to all, whether it
be of works or of grace; what it is in it selfe in the tender and termes
of it, that is the denomination of it.</HI> This is plaine, Mens faith or
unbelief, Mens obedience or transgression, cannot diversifie the
nature of that which God doth tender; And what God spake
to the people, he spake to all the people, the same to all, that he
spake to any, <HI>Exodus 19. 25. Exodus</HI> 20. 18. compared, and
therefore that is a mistake in some that say, <HI>That the Law is,
doubtlesse a pure covenant of Works to some men, but not to all.
It is a covenant of works, occasionally and accidentally, and not only to
those which are not related to, comprehended in, or made partakers of
the covenant of Grace.</HI> He should rather have said, that the ten
commandments had been a covenant of Grace, but sometimes by
an accident or especial occasion had become a covenant of Works,
which yet could not have held. The covenant of Grace and the
covenant of Works are two distinct and opposite <HI>Species,</HI> They
have one and the same univocal <HI>Genus,</HI> of whose nature they e∣qually
partake. Therefore as an Oxe can by no occasion or
accident, be a Horse, or a Horse a Sheep, or a Sheep a Lion, or
a Lion a man; so a covenant of Grace, can by no occasion or
accident be a covenant of Works; one and the same thing in∣tended
for one end, may occasionally and accidentally have a∣nother
event; as the Ministery intending salvation, may prove
an aggravat on of condemnation; but no occasion or accident
can change the nature of any thing, into that which is of a kind
opposite to it, and different from it. And, in such cases where the
event is hindred, and another happens; the denomination is,
and must be, from the primary intention. The Apostle calls the
Gospel <HI>the power of God to salvation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Under <HI>Moses</HI> his administra∣tion, com∣mands were frequent and full, spiritual promises were rare and more obscure.</NOTE> Rom. 1. 16. The word is cal∣led

<P>Sixthly, <HI>In</HI> Moses <HI>time, and under his administration, commands
were frequent and full, as well ceremonial, as moral, as also menaces.
<PB N="214" REF="125"/>
The directive, and maledictive part of the Law; were clear and open,
for discovery of sinne, to work to a sense of danger, to put them in a
posture to look for and long after the Messiah; But the promises more
obscure, (I mean the promises of eternity) scarce known, any other∣wise
then as they were shadowed out in temporal things.</HI> This (as the
Apostle shews) was figured by that vaile, which was before
<HI>Moses</HI> his face, when he spake with the people upon the renu∣ing
of the Tables, <HI>Moses</HI> his face upon his converse with God in
the <HI>Mount,</HI> shone with that glory, that <HI>Aaron</HI> and all the chil∣dren
of <HI>Israel</HI> were afraid to come nigh, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34. 30. Afterwards
he speaks to the people, and talks with them; <HI>And till he had
done speaking with them, he put a vaile before his face,</HI> verse 33.
Whereupon the Apostle having entred comparison between the
Ministers of the Law, and the Ministers of the Gospel, alludes to
this vaile before <HI>Moses</HI> his face, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 12, 13, 14. in these words,
<HI>Seeing then we have such hope,</HI> (saith he) <HI>we use great plainnesse of
speech, and not as</HI> Moses <HI>which put a vaile over his face, that the chil∣dren
of</HI> Israel <HI>could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abo∣lished,
but their mindes were blinded;</HI> Upon which <HI>Diodati</HI> saith; <HI>Mo∣ses
Ministry kept the people under the shadows of ceremonies, without
contemplating the mysteries which were figured by them to the bottom,
which was reserved for the time of the Gospel,</HI> Heb. 10. 4. <HI>Whereof
was a figure that vaile on</HI> Moses <HI>his face; Not</HI> (saith he) <HI>that, that
was the end of that act of</HI> Moses, <HI>but of that which the Apostle saith,
may be allegorically understood thereby, namely of the obscure dispensa∣tion
of the Law;</HI> Which obscure dispensation meeting with that
blindnesse that was in the judgements of that people, held them
in such ignorance, that they saw little of Grace in that co∣venant,
but rather through their blinde mistake, looked upon
it (the generality of them) as a covenant of Works. And this
the Apostle signifies in the place before quoted, as also, <HI>Rom. 10.
3. They being ignorant of Gods righteousnesse, and going about to
establish their own righteousnesse, have not submitted themselves to the
righteousnesse of God.</HI> This caused them so tenaciously to hold
to the precepts of the Law (especially to the ceremonial part,
which though more burdensome, yet was easilier fitted to their
corruption) that they refused Christ the end of the Law for
righteousnesse sake, to every one that beleeveth, <HI>Rom.</HI>

<P><PB N="215" REF="125"/>
Seventhly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There was so much of Grace and Christ held out in the Old Covenant to leave them without excuse.</NOTE> <HI>There was yet so much of grace, and Christ held out
in this covenant, that they were not only left without excuse, that
were under it; but convinced of sin, if they saw not Christ and the
grace of the covenant in it.</HI> Christ in his contest with the Jewes
(who would not receive him, but stood in opposition, and raised
persecution against him,) appeales to the Scriptures, Old Testa∣ment-Scriptures;
<HI>Search the Scriptures, for they testifie of me, and in
them you think to have eternal life,</HI> Iohn 5. 39. Where we see a
double <HI>encomium</HI> of the Scriptures. 1. From the Iewes own ac∣knowledgement,
In them eternal life may be found. 2. From the
testimony they give of Christ, In them, upon search, Christ may
be found; There are such discoveries there, that hold him out,
and eternal life in him, to those that search them. And they
suspecting, by that intimacy of communion that he profest to have
with the Father, and the heavy charge that he laid upon them,
that he was about to accuse them to the Father; Christ puts it off
from himself, and puts it upon one that they had least in suspi∣tion,
even <HI>Moses, Moses</HI> in whom they trusted, in whom they
pretended to repose confidence; It is he that is ready to accuse
them, not of breach of the Law, or transgression of any command
of his, (which they could easilier have beleeved) but of unbeliefe
of <HI>Moses; You have one that accuseth you, even</HI> Moses, <HI>in whom you
trust; for had ye beleeved</HI> Moses, <HI>ye would have beleeved me, for he
wrote of me.</HI> Unbelief in Christ, set forth in <HI>Moses,</HI> is a sinne,
which <HI>Moses</HI> his writings shall charge upon them. So also in that
speech of Christ to the two disciples in the way to <HI>Emmaus, O ye
fools and slow of heart, to beleeve all that the Prophets have spoken;
ought not Christ to have suffered those things, &amp; to enter into his glory?</HI>
where we see them charged with sin, in that they understood not
Christ in the Prophets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many phrases in use under the Old Cove∣nant-admini∣stration seem∣ingly holding out a Cove∣nant of Works, according to Scripture use hold out a Co∣venant of Grace.</NOTE> Christ in <HI>Moses,</HI> as follows there in the

unto them all the Scriptures the things concerning himselfe,</HI>

because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets
which are read every Sabbath day, they fulfilled them in condemning
him,</HI> Acts 13. 27.</P>
<P>Eightly, <HI>There are those phrases in</HI> Moses, <HI>which are ordinarily
quoted, as holding out a covenant of Works, and in a rigid interpre∣tation
are no other; yet in a qualified sense, in a Gespel-sense, and ac∣cording
<PB N="216" REF="126"/>
to Scripture-use of the phrase, they hold out a covenant of
Grace, and the termes and conditions of it;</HI> To instance in some few,
<HI>Deut. 4. 1. Now therefore hearken, O</HI> Israel, <HI>unto the statutes, and
unto the judgements which I teach you to do them, that ye may live,
and go in and possesse the land which the Lord God of your fathers gi∣veth
you,</HI> Deut. 5. 33. <HI>You shall walk in all the wayes which the Lord
your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be
well with you; and that ye may prolong your dayes in the land which
ye shall possesse,</HI> Deut. 30. 16. <HI>In that I command this day to
love the Lord thy God, to walk in his wayes and to keep his com∣mandments, and his statutes, and his judgements, that thou mayest live
and multiply, and the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in the land whither
thou goest to possesse it.</HI> Deut. 6. 24, 25. <HI>And the Lord commanded
us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God for our good always,
that he might preserve us alive as it is this day. And it shall be our
righteousnesse if we observe to do all these commandments before the
Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</HI> We may so interpret
those Scriptures (and the Jewes, as it appears for a great part, did
so interpret them) that they hold out a covenant of Works, when
Grace was not at all acknowledged to assist in doing, nor Christ
known at all to satisfie for failing, and to expiate for transgres∣sion.
These seeing nothing but a reward upon labour, and punish∣ment
in case of transgression. They may yet be so interpreted as
taking Grace, in the Work for change of the heart, and putting it
into a posture for obedience, according to that even in <HI>Moses,</HI>
Deut. 306. <HI>I will circumcise thy heart, and the heart if thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed, to
love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that
thou mayest live,</HI> and so these duties are only Gospel qualifications
of truth and sincerity of obedience. In this sense (which they
may well bear, and I take to be their native sense) here is no more
than what we finde in the Gospel, from Christ and the Apostles.
<HI>They that have done good, shall rise unto the resurr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of life,</HI> John
5. 28. <HI>To them that by patient continuing in well-doing, seek for glo∣ry
and immortality, eternal life,</HI> Rom 2. 5. Where (as in many other
places)
we may see, that according to the New covenant, a man
may make the attaining of life, the end of his work, and the Read∣er
may see phrases of his nature, to be New covenant, New Te∣stament,
and Gospel-language; unlesse they will charge Christ
and the Apostles to have Old Testament-spirits. To save a mans

self may be so understood as to bear a sense, purely legal, anti-Evangelical, and opposite to Grace or Faith in Christ, and so it is
used by the Apostle, or a phrase very near it; <HI>For by Grace ye
are saved through Faith, not of your selves, it is the gift of God,</HI> Eph.
2. 8. Not obscurely shewing, that if we are saved of our selves, it is
not of Grace, not of Faith, and not the gift of God. Yet the
phrase may be understood in a Gospel-sense, as requiring and
implying no more than our endeavour in a state of grace, through
the assistance of the Spirit, to walk in Salvation-way, To strive
to enter in at the strait gate, and to seek the Kingdome of
God, and the righteousnesse of it, and so we finde it used, and
that more than once in Scriptures, 1 <HI>Tim. 4. 16. Take heed unto
thy self, and unto the doctrine; in so doing thou wilt save thy
self, and them that hear thee.</HI> Ministers taking heed to doctrine,
save hearers, and yet are no saviours, in opposition, but in subor∣dination
to the Lord Jesus; Ministers and others taking heed to
themselves, save themselves, and yet are no self-saviours in oppo∣sition
to free grace, the merit of, or faith in Christ Jesus; <HI>Peter</HI>
in his first Sermon after receiving of the holy Ghost pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cht the
Gospel, yet he urg'd this, which some will have to be no other
than a covenant of Works; <HI>Save your selves from this untoward
generation,</HI> Act. 2. 40. And the Apostle preacht no other thing than
Christ and him crucified, when he called on the <HI>Philippians, to
work out their own salvation with fear and trembling,</HI> Phil. 2. 12. <HI>To
be found in our own righteousnesse, in that sense that</HI> Paul <HI>uses it,</HI>
Phil. 3. 8. <HI>doth exclude the righteousnesse of faith,</HI> that was no
bottom on which he durst stand; yet in the sense that <HI>Ezekiel</HI>
uses it, the soul is delivered by it, <HI>Though</HI> Noah, Daniel, <HI>and</HI>
Job <HI>stood before me, they would but deliver their own soules by their
righteousness,</HI> Ezek. 14. 14. so Ezek. 18. 22. <HI>In his righte∣ousness
that he hath done he shall live; Noah</HI> was an heir of the <HI>righ∣teousness
of faith,</HI> Heb. 11. 7. as the Holy Ghost himself witnesseth;
yet the same Holy Ghost tells us, <HI>that his own righteousness delivers
his soul.</HI> So <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>Righteousnesse delivers from death;</HI> he doth
not only say, it would deliver, were it exact and compleat, but (such
as it is) it doth deliver, <HI>Prov. 20.2. David</HI> (as <HI>Paul</HI> observes) <HI>de∣scribeth
the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteous∣ness
without works,</HI> Rom. 4. 6. Yet the same <HI>David</HI> puts blessed∣nesse
upon works, <HI>Psal. 112. 1. Blessed is the man that feareth the
<PB N="218" REF="127"/>
Lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments.</HI> Psalme 119. 12.
<HI>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord;
Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, that seek him with the whole
heart.</HI> Ps. 128. 1. <HI>Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh
in his wayes.</HI> And so also the Apostle <HI>James, Who so looketh into
the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, not being a forget∣ful
hearer, but a doer of the word, that man shall be blessed in his deed,
James</HI> 1. 25. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, <HI>We are kept by the migh∣ty
power of God through faith unto salvation,</HI> 1 Pet. 1 5. Our salva∣tion
is not in our own keeping, It is not our own care, that frees
us from destruction; yet <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>He that is begotten of God
sinneth not, and keepeth himself, that the wicked one toucheth him not,</HI>
1 John 5. 18. Here are the same words affirmed, and denied, and
both from one and the same mouth of truth; a different sense
therefore is to be enquired after. A righteousnesse, which is the
condition of the covenant of Works; out of our own inherent
strength and abilities, in an exact perfection, is denied, a righte∣ousnesse,
not of us, but through grace wrought in us, in sinceri∣ty,
which the covenant of Grace calls for, is asserted and re∣quired.</P>
<P>Ninthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Though <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> delivered a Covenant of Grace to <HI>Israel,</HI> yet the Law is sometime ta∣ken in that re∣strained sense as to hold forth a Covenant of Works.</NOTE> Though the whole Law that <HI>Moses</HI> delivered from God
on Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> to the people (and is among the sacred Oracles of
God for posterity) do containe a covenant of Grace, yet the Law
is taken sometime in that strict sense, as containing a covenant of
Works, and holding forth life upon condition of perfect obedi∣ence.
So the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 5, 6. puts an opposition between
the righteousnesse of the Law, and the righteousness of Faith; So
also <HI>Gal. 3. 18. If righteousnesse be by the Law, it is no more of
Promise,</HI> So that, there is a necessity of distinguishing, between <HI>the
Law, abstracted from the Promise,</HI> the Promise of Christ, I meane
the Evangelical Promise, and the Law, <HI>including this Promise,</HI> and
writing of Christ Jesus, so that the works of the Law, considered
in the bare mandatory part of it, can save none; <HI>If righteousnesse
come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vaine;</HI> yet the righteousness
<HI>witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousnesse of God
which is by Faith of Jesus Christ,</HI> Rom. 3. 21, 22. is, our justification,
and brings salvation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 21, 22. And no marvel, that <HI>Moses,</HI>
and the Law delivered by <HI>Moses,</HI> should be taken in Scripture in so
different an acception; when circumcision, that leading ceremony
<PB N="219" REF="127"/>
of the Law, is sometimes looked upon as a Priviledge, as hath
been shewed, and a saving Ordinance, <HI>Rom. 3. 1. Rom.</HI> 4. 11. And
sometimes as a yoke, <HI>A yoke that neither our fathers nor we were a∣ble
to bear; Acts</HI> 15. 10. yea, as a deadly ceremony, dividing and
cutting off from Christ. <HI>I</HI> Paul <HI>say unto you, if you be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing,</HI> Gal. 5. 2. So that the Law abstracted
from Christ, as the greater part of the Jews took it) was a Ministry
of condemnation, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 9. It could never reach so high as sal∣vation,
but including Christ, it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perfect, and saves the soule,
<HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 7. The Apostles thinks he can never sufficiently vilifie the
ceremonial Fabrick, looked upon, as absolute of it self, without far∣ther
relation; We see what titles he gives those Ordinances, <HI>Weak
and beggarly elements,</HI> Gal. 4. 9. <HI>Rudiments of this world,</HI> Col. 2. 8.
But being taken in their relative consideration, as a School-master
to Christ, they are <HI>an attonement, a sweet savour,</HI> they are so cal∣led,
times without end; The honour due to Christ (who was an
Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour, <HI>Eph.</HI>
5. 2. and by whom we receive the attonement, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 11.) with∣out
derogation from Christ, is given to them; not by way of op∣position,
but subordination; and not by mans device, but Gods
appointment not holding the soul from him, but ministerially
serviceable to lead to him.</P>

<P>This difference of the covenants (however the reality

an estimate upon them? especially having at hand by them, in
the New Covenant, Promises lasting to eternity. This doctrine
hath produced those Atheistical jeers and blasphemies, <HI>Old Te∣stament-men,
Old Testament-spirits;</HI> yea, by inevitable conse∣quence,
if it may stand, it will bring the bane and ruine of New

as couples in ancient buildings, so answer one
the other, that, neither can stand, if either fall; It is the Go∣spel
of Jesus Christ that we seek in New Testament-Scriptures.
Now that is defined to be, <HI>that which God before promised by his
Prophets concerning his Son Christ Jesus,</HI> Rom. 1. 2. In the
promise of the Prophets then, this must be found. A righteousness

witnessing, Christ is the All that in the Gospel we look after; he
must be an Old Testament-Christ, whom the Law and Prophets
hold out to us or else he is not the Christ of God; All the vili∣fying

Jesus.</P>

had better thoughts of it. The Apostle, speaking of the Pa∣triarchs
confession, that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth;
makes his observation upon it; <HI>They that say these things, plainly
declare that they seek a Countrey.</HI> A stranger, or pilgrim, is a man
not at his home, but seeks a countrey. Now this countrey must ei∣ther
be <HI>Earthly,</HI> or <HI>Heavenly,</HI> there is not a third which men
could have in desire. That it was not an earthly countrey that they
sought; he makes good, <HI>in that they had opportunity of return, they
might have gone back to</HI> Ur <HI>of the</HI> Chaldees <HI>at pleasure.</HI> Then it
follows, as he inferres, that <HI>they sought a better countrey, that is,
an Heavenly,</HI> Heb. 11. 16. Men of this opinion have not only the
Apostles authority against them, but (putting himself on in a Lo∣gical
dispute with them) his reasons likewise, yea, those that
were most carnal, and earthly-minded among them, were taught
to judge better of the Promises, that they lived under; Christ
gives that testimony of the Jewes, with whom he had contest,
that in the Scriptures they thought to have everlasting life,
<HI>John</HI> 5. 39. They had no Scriptures but Old Covenant-Scri∣ptures,
and of them, they had this opinion, which was no errour
of theirs corrected by Christ, but were by him confirmed in it,
Christ justifies them in their opinion, that in Scripture they
thought to have everlasting life, and rectifies them in the way of
finding everlasting life in it. A great part of the dispute is a∣bout
those words of God to <HI>Abraham,</HI> in which the foundati∣on
of the Covenant stands, <HI>I will be thy God, and the God of thy
seed,</HI> whether in them there be promises, only of earth, or of hea∣ven
likewise? And this Christ himself determines in his answer
to the <HI>Sadduces</HI> about the Resurrection, where he applies that
speech of God to <HI>Moses</HI> at the bush: <HI>I am the God of</HI> Abra∣ham,
<HI>the God of</HI> Isaac, <HI>and the God of</HI> Jacob; for proof that
<HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> live for ever, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22. 33. How
<PB N="223" REF="129"/>
injurious are they to the Covenant of God with his people, that
put such unworthy limits upon it: Other people that were
without Covenant had temporal mercies from God, they were
protected, and provided for by him; <HI>Leave thy fatherlesse chil∣dren
unto me, and let thy widows trust in me</HI> (saith the Lord to the
people of <HI>Edom,</HI>) I will keep them alive, <HI>Jer.</HI> 49. 11. The wo∣man

people of God in Covenant did enjoy; But if this glosse of the
Covenant may stand, the dogs crumbs, are beyond all the chil∣drens

must be cast out, not to be heire with the son of the free-woman,
<HI>Gen.</HI> 21. 10. he and his posterity must be cast out of Covenant,
and in <HI>Isaac</HI> the seed must be called. But if there were no more
in <HI>Isaacs</HI> grant than the possession of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the son of the
bond-woman had had the better of the bargain: <HI>Ishmaelites</HI> in
earthly possessions exceeded <HI>Israelites;</HI> And <HI>Esau</HI> had not need
to have complained so much of the losse of his birth right, and
his brothers supplantation of him; if <HI>Jacob</HI> had gained no more
than a possession for his posterity in <HI>Canaan,</HI> having that blessing
both promised and performed; <HI>That his dwelling should be the
fatnesse of the earth, and the dew of Heaven from above,</HI> Gen.
27. 39. he had small cause of envie of his brothers felicity. How
did the Saints of those times boast of God, exult and triumph in
him, proclaiming his goodnesse, <HI>That there was no Rock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their
God?</HI> If their portion did reach (with the men of this world)
only to this life, none can be able to give a reason of such tri∣umphant
exultations. And the <HI>Psalmist</HI> had never spoken of it
as the worlds portion, in case himself had looked for no better an
inheritance. Providence was, indeed, singularly eminent over
that people, yet considering their great afflictions which they still
bore, and heavy chastisements wherewith they were exercised;
if that special care of God, had not had an influence upon eter∣nity,
<PB N="224" REF="130"/>
that blasphemous conclusion of the Oratour, <HI>that a man
might see how much the gods esteemed the Nation of the Iewes, in
that they were so often carried into captivity,</HI> would hardly receive
a satisfying refutation. Certainly their sufferings were above any
other Nation, <HI>Amos 3. 2. You only have I known of all the
families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniqui∣ties,</HI>
if then they had their hope only in this life, and were not
chastened in the world, that they might not be condemned with
the world; as the Apostle speaks of Christians, so we might say
of the Nation of the Jewes; <HI>Of all Nations in the world they were
the most miserable.</HI> See <HI>Chamier, lib. 5. de Baptism, cap. 11.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Old Covenant was a pure Gospel-Covenant,
and not mixt.</HEAD>
<P>2ly. OThers that rise not so high against the first covenant, as
to make it a covenant meerly carnal; yet loth to yield
to so much truth, as to confesse it to be a covenant Evangelical;
have found out a middle way; which yet they think may carry on
their interests, and say, <HI>It is not a pure Gospel-covenant, but mixt;</HI>
and therein differs from the second covenant, which is wholly
Evangelical: In which they seem to go, but one half of the
way with their old friends the Jesuites, from whom in this contro∣versie
they so much glean, yet, far enough to sit down with Ana∣baptists,
to cast Infants (as they hope) out of the covenant and
Church-membership, and so exclude them from Baptisme.
Here I shall undertake to make good these foure particu∣lars.</P>
<P>1. That this expression of theirs is very untoward;<NOTE PLACE="marg">That expressi∣on of a mixt Covenant un∣der which the Fathers are supposed to live untoward.</NOTE> and such
that will bear no fair sense, without the utter overthrow, even of
that difference between the Covenants, which they would build
on this distinction.</P>
<P>2. That the proof that they bring of this mixture of the first
covenant is very weak, and not at all cogent.</P>
<P>3. That they are not constant to themselves, but give and take,
and know not what to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="130"/>
4. In case all were granted, yet they know not how to bring
any thing home, of all that they say, to serve their own inter∣ests.
Their expressions, I say, are untoward, in denying purity
of Gospel in the first Covenant, and affirming a mixture. That
which is not pure, but mixt, is a compound of pure and impure;
such that hath some ingredients, such as they ought, and others
such that make all adulterate: <HI>As silver mingled with dresse, or
wine with water,</HI> Isa. 1. 22. The false teachers (Saint <HI>Pauls</HI>
adversaries) preach such a mixt Gospel, when they urged with
such vehemency a mixture of works, which caused the Apostle
to stand in such feare of the <HI>Corinthians, lest they should be drawn
away from the simplicity that is in Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 11. 2. They do
not beleeve that the Gospel which <HI>Paul</HI> tells us was preached
to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gal. 3. 8. was any such impure Gospel, this sure is
not their meaning, they dare not say that <HI>Abraham</HI> was under
any such delusion; What then can be the meaning, but that he
had promises, not only of blisse, and in reference to eternal sal∣vation;
but also promises of earthly concernment, as that of
the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and his plantation there? <HI>The Covenant takes
its denomination from the Promises,</HI> (saith one of them) <HI>but the
Promises are mixt; some Evangelical, belonging to those to whom
the Gospel belongeth; some are domestick or civil Promises, specially
respecting the house of</HI> Abraham, <HI>and the policie of</HI> Israel. To
this I readily agree, and then the distinction falls to nothing;
Seeing in Gospel times, in New Testament-dayes, this will deno∣minate
a not pure, but mixt Gospel as well as in those times, we
our selves are under such a Gospel as well as the Jewes. I know
not how we could pray in faith, <HI>Give us this day our daily bread;</HI>
in case we were without a promise of these things, or <HI>how man
could live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God,</HI> in
case we had no word from God. The Apostle tells us, <HI>Godlinesse
hath the promise of this life, and that which is to come, 1 Tim.</HI> 4. 8.
It would trouble many a perplexed man in case he could not make
good, that those words, <HI>Verily thou shalt be fed,</HI> Psal. 37. 3. did
not at all belong to him. There is no believing man in any relati∣on,
but he hath Gospel-Promises in concernment to that relati∣on,
as appears in that speech of <HI>Pauls</HI> encouragement of ser∣vants,
<HI>Epes 6. 8. Knowing whatsoever for good thing any man doth,
the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</HI> It
<PB N="226" REF="131"/>
It were ill with all sorts, had not they their domestick relation-promises,
which these speak of, as making a mixture.</P>
<P>2. As their expressions are untoward, so taking them at the best,
their proof is weak, <HI>That the Covenant takes its denomination
from the Promises; but the Promises are mixt,</HI> say these men.
The most eminent Promises, which contain the marrow of all,
give the denomination, and not such that are annext as Appen∣dants
to them. The Promise of the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> is an ap∣pendant
to the great covenant made of God with <HI>Abraham,</HI> as
<HI>Chamier</HI> with good warrant from the text, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7, 8. calls
it, <HI>lib. de baptis. cap. sec.</HI> The Covenant being made of God,
to be the God of <HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed, which might have been
made good wheresoever they had inhabited or sojourned, the
promise of <HI>Canaan</HI> is over and above added to it. The reason
given in by one for his dislike of <HI>Chamiers</HI> expression, calling it an
Appendix to the covenant, is little to purpose, <HI>Psal. 105.
10, 11. The gift of the land of</HI> Canaan <HI>is called a Covenant,</HI>
saith he, <HI>and therefore is not an appendant to it.</HI> By the same rea∣son
Circumcision must be the Covenant, and not a Seal appen∣dant
to it; seeing Circumcision is called a Covenant, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 10.
they are not ignorant of these Scripture-metonymies.</P>
<P>3. As the proof is weak, to make the Covenant not a pure
Gospel-covenant, but mixt; so, they are not constant to
themselves, pointing that out, which makes pure Gospel, <HI>Gen.
17. 5. Gen. 15. 5. Gen. 12. 3. Gen.</HI> 18. 18. illustrated by
some New Testament-Scriptures, <HI>Rom. 4. 17, 18. Gal. 3.
8, 9, 16. Acts</HI> 3. 25. one observes, <HI>it is to be noted, that
those Promises, which were Evangelical, according to the more in∣ward
sense of the Holy Ghost, do point at the priviledges of</HI> Abrahams
<HI>house in the outward face of the words,</HI> and thereupon raises a
doubt, whether any covenant made with <HI>Abraham</HI> be simply E∣vangelical?
And so he findes out Evangelical-Promises in the
inwards of that covenant, which is non-Evangelical in the out∣ward
face; So <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> with whom he so much (to speak in
his own language) symbolizeth, finds out spiritual Evangelical
Promises, in that which he concludes to be of another nature;
denying that the Promise made to <HI>Abraham</HI> in the letter, was
any Promise of forgivenesse of sins, but <HI>of special protection and
government, and earthly happinesse;</HI> yet confesseth that in a my∣stical
<PB N="227" REF="131"/>
sense they were spiritual Promises,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> quodam sensu fuisse e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> promissiones &amp; remissionis pee∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m ac vita <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternae &amp; ad nos pertinere.</NOTE> both of pardon of sin,
and life eternal, and that they belong to us, <HI>Bellar. de Sacr.
Bapt. lib. 1. cap.</HI> 4. whereupon <HI>Chamier</HI> observes, That which
is promised mystically, God in covenant doth promise, but hea∣ven
is here promised mystically; therefore in this covenant here
is a Promise of heaven; so the inward, and outward face, will
be all Evangelical.</P>
<P>Lastly, they yet know not how to bring any thing home
(were all granted) to serve their interest, they seem to contend
that the Evangelical Promises are vested in the persons of true
Belevers. The other which are civil, or domestick, serving to
make up the mixture, were priviledges descendable, and tradu∣cible
to posterity, and upon this account, circumcision of the na∣tural
seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> came in for confirmation and seale of
that which alone was civil, domestical, and non-Evangelical;
and being not considered, as a leading Sacrament of the whole
Church, as Baptisme is now, but only of the Jewish Church, as
such, proper to <HI>Abraham</HI> and his posterity, and much differing
from Baptisme, it is no argument that we in Gospel-times trans∣mit
any such priviledge to posterity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circumcision was a Seal of spiritual mer∣cies of the same that Baptisme sealeth.</NOTE> or that our seed before
actual faith, have any title to the covenant. This seems to be
their meaning, to which we have many things to say.</P>
<P>First, that Orthodox Divines, both ancient and moderne
have made circumcision to be of the same signification and use
as Baptism, and till Anabaptists closed, they had no adversaries but
Papists, who to advance their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pus operatum</HI> in the Sacraments
of the New Testament, will have them, as far to exceed the Old,
as heaven doth earth, and the substance doth the shadow; This
is observed by <HI>Chamier Panstrat. Cathol. Tom. 4. lib. 2. cap. 19.
sect.</HI> 58. having reckoned up several testimonies to this purpose,
he addes,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Plurima sunt ejusdem te∣stimonia exqui∣bus constat per∣suasum olim fuisse Christia∣nis, non fuisse admodum diver∣san circumci∣sionis rationem &amp; Baptismi. Cur bodie mu∣tatum▪ &amp; qui∣dem in Papista∣rum gratiam &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>idem ad ar∣bitrium Jesu∣narum.</NOTE> <HI>There are very many like testimonies, by which it ap∣pears,
that Christians were heretofore perswaded that there was no so
great difference between circumcision and baptisme; and why, saith
he, is it now changed? Truly in favour of the Papists, and ac∣cording
to the pleasure of the Iesuites.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, if circumcision have respect to those Promises that
were no Gospel mercies, but civil, domestical, restrained to Jews,
and not appertaining to Christians; How could it be a distinction
between Jew and Gentile respective to Religion? it might have
<PB N="228" REF="132"/>
made a civil distinction, and the want of it have been an evi∣dence
against other Nations, that they had been none of the mul∣tiplied
seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> according to the flesh, and that their
interest had not been in <HI>Canaan.</HI> But how it could have con∣cluded
them to have been <HI>without Christ, strangers from the cove∣nant
of Promise, having no hope, and without God in the world,</HI> as
the Apostle determines upon their uncircumcision, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 11, 12.
cannot be imagined.</P>
<P>Thirdly, How is it that we hear so much in Scripture of <HI>circum∣cision
of the heare</HI> Jer. 4. 4. Rom. 2. 28. Deut. 10. 16. Deut. 30. 6.
Ezek. 44. 9. and the circumcised to have this character, that
<HI>they worship God in Spirit and in Truth;</HI> if circumcision have not
relation to Promises that are spiritual? When complaint is
made of uncircumcision in heart, is it not (as it is ordinarily un∣derstood)
that their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndes were carnal, and not taken up with spi∣ritual
things or is it that they were not fixt on their civil and do∣mestick
interests? when they are said to be uncircumcised, as <HI>Ier.</HI>
6. 10. is it not upon that account that <HI>Ieremy</HI> there gives, that
<HI>they could not hear the Word of the Lord, that they had no delight in
it, that it was a reproach to them;</HI> or is it because they could not
suck in Promises of meer civil, home, and self-interests? So it
must need be if circumcision be such a Seale, when they em∣proved
it for the use to which it was instituted, they kept
the right use of it, and were not worthy of reproof concern∣ing
it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, what Sacraments had the Jewes of any Gospel-rela∣tion,
if this respected alone their civil interests? There might
be more spoken to that of the Passeover, to carry it to peculiar
National mercies, than to this of circumcision. See</HI> Exod. 13.
14, 15. And it shall be when thy sinne asketh thee in time to come,
saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of
hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndage.
And it came to passe when Pharao<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would hardly let us go, that the
Lord slew all the first-borne in the land of Egypt; both the first borne
of man, and the first-borne of beasts; therefore I sacrifice unto the
Lord all that openeth the Matrix, being males; but all the first-born
of my children, I redeem. <HI>I am sure far lesse can be said to
carry it to that which is spiritual, and of common concernment
both to Jews and Christians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="132"/>
Fifthly, how is it that the Apostle giving a definition of cir∣cumcision,
refers it to nothing national, civil, or domestick; but
only to that which is purely spiritual, Speaking of <HI>Abraham,</HI>
he saith; <HI>He received the signe of Circumcision, a seale of the
righteousnesse of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised?</HI>
The righteousnesse of faith, is a Promise purely Evangelical,
<HI>Romanes 3. 22. Romanes 3. 30. Romanes 10. 3. Philippians</HI>
3. 8. and this Circumcision sealed, the self-same thing that
our Sacraments seale; So that as their extraordinary Sacra∣ments
are expressely affirmed to be the same with ours, by
the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor. 10. 3 They eat all the same spiritual
meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink,</HI> so are their ap∣pointed
established Sacraments, Circumcision, and the Passe∣over.
Will they with <HI>Bellarmine, lib. 1. cap. 17. de Sacra∣mentis
in genere,</HI> deny, that <HI>Circumcision was an universal seale
of faith, and affirme that it was only an individual seale of the in∣dividual
faith of</HI> Abraham, that so all may fall to the ground
which is spoken from that Text of the use of Circumcision to
the Jewes, all that is there spoken, having reference only to
<HI>Abraham</HI> in person; I answer, 1. This Popish shift is flat
against the Apostle; He brings it as an argument for proof
of the way, of our Justification to be by faith alone, which
were a meer inconsequence, if proper to him, and not be∣longing
to others. 2. It is flat against <HI>Moses,</HI> who referres
this of circumcision to the covenant there mentioned, <HI>Gene∣sis</HI>
17. 7. But the covenant is not with <HI>Abraham</HI> alone, but
his seed also together with him, as is there plaine. 3. It
carries several absurdities with it. (1.) By this meanes
Gods covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> in person, and his covenant
with Christians in Gospel-times is indeed the same; but his
covenant with all beleevers in the Old Testament and with
beleevers in the New Testament are essentially differing. <HI>A∣braham,</HI>
and New-Testament beleevers, are under one cove∣nant;
Old Testament-beleevers are under a covenant essen∣tially
differing. (2.) Then <HI>Zachary, Luke</HI> 1. 72. inter∣preting
the covenant made with <HI>Abraham</HI> of salvation by
Christ should have limited it to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and not extended it
to the Fathers; But we see all are there, under one and the
same mercy; our father <HI>Abraham;</HI> and all that followed
<PB N="230" REF="133"/>
him, even all that came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and were for <HI>Canaan,</HI>
are called Fathers, 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 10. 1. All our Fathers were
under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all
these had the same mercy in promise with <HI>Abraham. To
performe the mercy</HI> (saith <HI>Zachary) promised to our Fathers,
and to remember his holy covenant, the Oath which he sware to our
father</HI> Abraham. (3.) Then <HI>Abraham</HI> himself in person, and
Christians in the dayes of the Gospel are interessed in Christ,
and all other beleevers in the Law were without Christ; but
the contrary is plain. <HI>Moses</HI> esteemed the reproach of Christ
greater than the treasures of <HI>Egypt, Heb.</HI> 11. 26. (4.) Then
<HI>Abraham</HI> and Christians have from God the Kingdom of hea∣ven
and salvation; but the rest of the Jewes have nothing bet∣ter
than the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> They have no more than the co∣venant
reaches unto, and the seale of the covenant did con∣firm;
But the covenant reaches only temporal Promises, as
the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> in their opinion. These evasions <HI>Bellarmine</HI>
is put to, and Anabaptists are glad to follow, both of them wil∣ling
to say any thing rather than confesse a truth.</P>
<P>But they say,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> This was a seale to <HI>Abraham, of the righteousnesse
of faith, that he might be the Father of all them that beleeve, &amp;c.</HI>
But only <HI>Abraham</HI> is such a father.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> <HI>Answ.</HI> This priority of re∣ceiving
the Faith, and the signe and seale, is proper to <HI>Abraham;</HI>
each one could not be first, but father and childe, both received it,
and both had the righteousnesse of Faith sealed in it. If <HI>Bellar∣mine</HI>
please so well, I shall referre to <HI>Bellarmines</HI> opposites,

truth fastens upon them, and the friends of truth flie in their face;
and all to make it appear that a pure Gospel was preach't to
<HI>Abraham,</HI> and that the first covenant was not mixt, but truly E¦vangelical.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Covenant of Grace in Gospel-times admits Christians, in
a state of unregeneration, and is not limited in the bounds
of it to the Elect regenerate.</HEAD>
<P>THe two former supposed differences did lay the first cove∣nant
too low, not vouchsafing it the honour of a Gospel-co∣venant,
or at the best, a mixt Gospel; Two others follow,
which will hold us longer, that put too great a limit to the se∣cond
covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A third suppo∣sed difference between the Old and New Covenant.</NOTE> in respect of the latitude and extent of it. A third
difference therefore assigned by some, is, that the first covenant
took in all the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> by <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> as many as
professed themselves to be of the Faith, and that were willing to
joyne in the worship of the God of <HI>Abraham.</HI> The New Covenant,
they affirm, admits no more than Elect Regenerate persons. The
Gospel strips us of all relative Covenant holinesse, of all holi∣nesse
that is not real, and intrinsecal, and God ownes none, as
his Covenant-people, but Elect regenerate persons. In the first
place we shall take what is yielded, or at least not gain-sayed,
and after proceed to the examination of what is affirmed.</P>
<P>In Old Testament-times the covenant was made with <HI>Israel</HI>
in the uttermost latitude and extent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All of Israel were in Cove∣nant in Old Testament-times.</NOTE> with all that bore the name
of <HI>Israel,</HI> as we may see, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. at large held forth. There
is a covenant entred, and the words of it exprest, 1. With <HI>Israel,
verse</HI> 1. 2. With <HI>all Israel, verse</HI> 2. 3. With <HI>them to whom God
had not given an heart to perceive, eyes to see, and eares to hear,</HI> ver. 4.

of wood, Drawers of water,</HI> vers. 10, 11. 5. With <HI>them that were
present,</HI> and with them <HI>that were absent,</HI> verse 14, 15. All this
clearly shews in how great a latitude this covenant is entred; No
<HI>Israelite</HI> of any Sex, Age, Rank, nor any that joyned themselves
to that body are exempted▪ Which also farther appears in those
innumerable places of Scripture, where God owns that people
generally, promiscuously as his people, professing himself to
be their God, and he is the God of none, but a covenant-people,
of his own covenant-people, others are without God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 12.

sin; <HI>Ye are the children of the Lord your God, ye shall not cut your
selves, nor make any baldnesse between your eyes for the dead, for thou
art an holy people to the Lord thy God,</HI> Deut. 14. 1, 2. This is plead∣ed

of question, Reckoning up the priviledges of <HI>Israel</HI> according
to the flesh, nine in number, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. This is one, <HI>The
covenants, Israel</HI> then after the flesh was in covenant; All
<HI>Israel</HI> were the covenant-people of God. There were many not
Elect, not Regenerate; but there was not a man not in covenant,
not owned of God as visibly his; <HI>Thou hast avouched the Lord this
day to be thy God.—And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be
his people,</HI> Deut. 26. 17, 18. This was the state of the Church of old.
But now, as is affirmed, it is far otherwise. God is not so large in
his priviledges, nor so ample in his munificence, none have honour

Marks and signes of mens being in covenant with God, this must
needs imply that some professing Christians are in covenant with
God, and some without, which is yet farther evidenced, when
they conclude, that in case a man be in covenant with God, then
happinesse and salvation follows; But when these men fully explain
themselves, they yeeld up again to us, that which seemingly they
had taken from us, and ordinarily do distinguish of an outward,
and inward covenant, acknowledging the outward covenant to
be made with every member of the Church and the Parents, with
that hear and professedly accept the promises, and their children,
But the inward covenant as they say, belongs to them onely, that
receive the benefits of it, and are upright in it. An eminent
Divine putting the Question, and returning answer, How a man
may know himself to be in covenant with God; presently foresees
an Objection against any such Quaere. As <HI>Saul</HI> and all the people
of <HI>Israel</HI> were in covenant with God, so all professing Chri∣stians
are covenanters likewise; and hereby all distinguish∣ing
notes of Professors, some in covenant, and some without
must needs fall to the ground, one member then of the distincti∣on,
having no being for solution of the doubt, he layes down
a distinction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinctions holding forth the meaning of these Divines in these expres∣sions.</NOTE> <HI>There is</HI> (saith he) <HI>a twofold covenant. 1. A sin∣gle
Covenant which God makes with his children when they are bap∣tized,
which is this; if ye will believe, repent, and walk in my ways,
ye shall be saved, now if they break this condition, God is freed.
2. A double covenant to performe both parts, which is this, if you will
repent and beleeve, ye shall be saved, and I will give you an heart,
and you shall repent, believe, and be saved:</HI> So <HI>Preston</HI> on Attri∣butes,
<HI>part 2. page</HI> 85. 86. These distinctions, plainly yeeld
that there is a covenant between God and man, in this lati∣tude,
of which we speak, and which here is exprest, and that
all professed Christians so called, are in an outward and single
covenant, which puts them into a capacity of Sacraments, and
their children, which is a covenant properly so called, and
which Scripture holds out for the covenant of God with his
<PB N="234" REF="135"/>
people. These Divines yeelding so much, and their meaning be∣ing
so Orthodox, there is no reason of contraversie with them,
or contention about words; Yet I should choose rather to ex∣presse
my self in <HI>Pareus</HI> his words against <HI>Stapleton</HI> the Jesuite,
on 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 14. objecting against this doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esse in foedere dicitur duplici∣ter, vel quoad jus foederis, vel quoad foederis beneficia. Est in foedere, vel qui obtinet be∣neficia foederis, quae sunt remis∣sio peccatorum, adoptio, regene∣ratio, salus, vel qui tantum ha∣bet jus, vel symbolum foede∣ris externum, ut socius foede∣ris, non alienus censeatur.</NOTE> for it is a do∣ctrine
which Antipaedobaptists, and Independents have bor∣rowed
from Jesuites, and we have them all in this, as in many
other things our Adversaries, <HI>To be in covenant,</HI> saith he, <HI>is taken
two ways, either according to tiole to the covenant, or to the benefits of
the covenant. He is said to be in covenant, that either obtaines the
benefits of the covenant, which are remission of sinnes, adoption, &amp;c.
Or else that hath onely the title, and outward badge of the cove∣nant,
so that he is repute to have interest in it, and is not an alien from
it.</HI> The right of covenant belongs to all that externally make
profession. These engage themselves upon Gods termes. The
benefit of the covenant, remission of sinnes, justification, adopti∣on,
&amp;c. belongs only to the Elect regenerate. Or farther we
may distinguish of the covenant of grace, and the grace fol∣lowing
the covenant, The covenant of grace is in the lati∣tude
before mentioned, the grace following the covenant in
that restriction that some contend for, or else we may distin∣guish
of entring covenant, and stedfastnesse and faithfulnesse in
the covenant; All enter that are visible professors, onely the elect
and faithful are steady in it. This distinction is evidently ground∣ed
on <HI>Psal. 78. 34. They remembred that God was their rock, the
high God their Redeemer, nevertheless their heart was not right in
them, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</HI> All covenant-enterers,
are not covenant-keepers. To take off this restricti∣on,
and for overthrow of this imaginary difference, it were e∣nough
to require of these Asserters of this covenant-restriction,
and limit, where God hath put any such restraint, for <HI>affirmanti
incumbit probatio,</HI> and to require some reason, why men in na∣ture,
in Old Testament-times, should be honoured with that neare
relation to God, as to be of the Common-wealth of this people,
enjoying not barely civil and domestick Priviledges, but saving
Ordinances, and under the Gospel, must stand shut out of all
such visible relations, why unregenerate men in order to regene∣ration,
may not come under the discipline of God under the
Gospel, as well as under Old Testament-dispensations? Why
<PB N="235" REF="135"/>
poore sinners that confesse with their mouth with the Eunuch,
that Jesus Christ is the Sonne of God, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 37. may not be
indulged those proviledges (now Christ is come in the flesh to
save sinners) whereby they may be brought to be beleeve with the
heart that they may be saved? To those that would make such
a distance between the covenants, as to throw out of the cove∣nant
of God, and visible communion, all that are unregene∣rate,
we may speak in Christs words, <HI>From the beginning it was
not so,</HI> and either we must see some good ground, that in this
there is by the will of God, this great change, or else we shall be∣leeve,
<HI>as it was then, so it now.</HI> But I shall deale more liberal¦ly,
and make it appear, that the Gospel doth not only not quit
us of it, but establishes it; doth not only not abolish it (as it
doth the Types of the Law) but holds it forth, and gives testi∣mony
of the continuance of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">New Testament-Scriptures asserting the latitude
of the covenant of Grace in Gos∣pel-times.</HEAD>
<P>LEt that Text <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. in the first place be weighed <HI>Go,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Testa∣ment-Scrip∣tures holding out the Cove∣nant of Grace in its full and just latitude.</NOTE>
<HI>teach all Nations, &amp;c.</HI> which our adversaries in this cause
willingly consent to have translated, <HI>Disciple all Nations,</HI>
and therefore there needs no words nor stir to be made about
it, and that a Disciple of Christ is in covenant with God, is as
freely confest, he takes God in Christ to be his God, he layes
claime to salvation by him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 28. 19</NOTE> this ground being laid, in which I
think I have not an adversary, I draw from hence a twofold Ar∣gument.</P>
<P>First, that covenant between God and man, which is commit∣ted
to the Ministry of man to work, to judge of being wrought,
and to put to a Seale for confirmation of it, is a covenant one∣ly
visibly entred, and doth not require any inward real change,
or work upon the soule to the being of it. This Proposition is
<PB N="236" REF="136"/>
clear, man can judge no farther than of that which is outward and
visible, <HI>Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord look∣eth
on the heart.</HI> If none but a regenerate elect person be in
covenant, then none but God knowes who are in covenant.
Then we may apply that of the Apostle spoken of the Seal of E∣lection,
<HI>The Lord knoweth them that are his,</HI> 2 Tim. 2. 19. unto
every one that as a Church-member, is to be received into visible
fellowship; A Church-member, and an elect person, according
to this tenent are <HI>termini convertibiles;</HI> and the seale of the Spirit,
and the seale of the Sacrament are in equal latitude; To baptize an
unregenerate person is to put a seal to a blank, as high an abuse of
that sacred Ordinance, as the circumcision of the <HI>Sichemites, Gen.</HI>
34. 24. That this covenant is such, appears in that Text, It is com∣mitted
to man to work, and to judge of it being wrought, to put
a seal for ratification and confirmation of it. The Apostles were
to make Disciples, to bring men into covenant with God, and be∣ing
discipled, to baptise them, sealing them, as Gods in cove∣nant;
So <HI>John 4. 1, 2. When the Lord know that the Pharisees had
heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples then</HI> John, <HI>though
Jesus baptized not, but his Disciples.</HI> Here <HI>John</HI> made Disciples,
and baptized them being made; The Disciples of Iesus
made Disciples, and baptized them being made; An outward
work then to make profession of the faith, is sufficient to
make one a Disciple, and to bring him within the verge of the
covenant.</P>
<P>Secondly, That which a whole Nation, in Gods ordinary
way of administration is in a capacity to attaine, and enter in∣to,
is a covenant onely professed, visibly entred upon, and doth
not require any inward change, or work upon the soule to the
being of it; this is plaine, It cannot be expected in Gods ordi∣nary
way, that a Nation should be brought forth at once, all
really holy and sanctified, Such a field hath not been seen with∣out
tares, Such a floore without chaffe, Such a draw-net without
any fish that is bad; Such a Feast and no one without a wed∣ding
garment; But whole Nations are in a capacity, in Gods
ordinary way of working, to enter into this covenant, as is plaine
in the Text; The whole of the Nation, is, in their commission,
where they come, and in many Nations it hath had happy suc∣cesse,
Whole Nations without exceptions (unlesse strangers
<PB N="237" REF="136"/>
so journing) have been brought within covenant. One would
faine fasten another interpretation on those words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The literal grammatical sense of the words vindi∣cated.</NOTE> and make the
commission to sound, not according to the letter of the words,
nor yet according to the successe by grace attained, but to his li∣king,
and therefore is put to it to change the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
into <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and then [all Nations] must either be put
by apposition, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or with the Pre∣position
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and so instead of
<HI>disciple all Nations,</HI> it will be, <HI>make disciples in all Nations.</HI> This
he thinks is very tolerable, because <HI>to disciple,</HI> and <HI>to make disciples</HI>
is all one. But though they may be one in themselves, yet it
makes a maine difference in the phrase, and with the addition of
his preposition, inverts the whole meaning of the words, as to
the thing in controversie, which is such a violence offered to the
Text, as is not to be endured in him, that is about to draw a Lo∣gical
argument
for his advantage against an adversary. And as
it is against the letter of the Text, so it is plainly against our Sa∣viours
scope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confirmed by the relation that this more enlarged Com∣mission hath to that which was restrained to <HI>Israel</HI> onely.</NOTE> and end in giving this commission. <HI>This enlarge∣ment
unto all Nations in this place was in opposition to the restriction,</HI>
Matth. 10. 5. as by the adversary is confest. Now in that Nation,
to which there they were limitted, the whole of the Nation was
in covenant, all the land was the land of <HI>Immanuel,</HI> Esay 8. 8.
and consequently so it was to be in other Nations, by vertue
of this happy enlargement, or else the opposition is utter∣ly
taken away, the meaning of the words clouded, and the
Apostles at a losse for the understanding of them; Ha∣ving
before spent their paines in a Nation, all Disciples,
and now having a commission for the discipling of all Nati∣ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By Old Testa∣ment-prophe∣cies.</NOTE>
how shall they understand the words, unlesse the whole
of the Nation, where they come are to be discipled? And here∣to
accord the prophecies of Scripture, for the calling of the
Nations of the Gentiles, <HI>God shall enlarge Japhet, and he shall
dwell in the tents of</HI> Sem, <HI>Gen. 9. 27. Sem</HI> was wholly in covenant,
not by pieces and parcels, but universally in covenant; <HI>Japhet</HI> is to
come in succession into covenant in like latitude, <HI>Psalme 2. 8.
Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</HI> It is not some
among the Nations of the Heathen that are to be the inheritance
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Christ, but the Heathen, To which agrees, <HI>Rev. 11. 15. The
<PB N="238" REF="137"/>
Kingdomes of the earth, shall become the Kingdomes of the Lord,
and of his Christ; Immanuel</HI> of old had one, now he shall have
more Kingdomes, and they become his, no other way, than
by discipling; Gods Ministers are his men of warre, for subduing
and captivating them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 4, 5. and Kingdoms are promi∣sed
them, not some onely in Kingdoms. <HI>Alexander</HI> would not sit
down with such a conquest, neither will Christ Jesus. If to
possesse some in a Kingdome, be to possesse a Kingdome, then
Antichrist of long hath had this Kingdome; <HI>All Kings shall bow
down before him, all Nations shall serve him,</HI> Psal. 72. 11. <HI>All Na∣tions
whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O
Lord, and shall glorifie thy Name,</HI> Psal. 86. 9. <HI>Thou shalt call a
Nation which thou knowest not, and Nations that knew not thee,
shall run unto thee,</HI> Esay 55. 5. There God calls the Nation,
and the Nation doth answer Gods call. <HI>In that day</HI> Is∣rael
<HI>shall he a third with</HI> Egypt, <HI>and with</HI> Assyria, <HI>even a blessing
in the midst of the land, whom the Lord of Hosts shall blesse, saying,
Blessed be</HI> Egypt <HI>my people, and</HI> Assyria <HI>the work of my hands, and</HI>
Israel <HI>my inheritance.</HI> There, <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Assyria</HI> are in equipage
with <HI>Israel,</HI> all three sister-Churches, <HI>Israel</HI> without any pre∣heminence;
Either <HI>Israel</HI> then was not a Nation of Disciples,
a Nation wholly within covenant, or else these are to be Nati∣onal
Churches; the whole of the Nation to be discipled and brought
into covenant. Passing by other Scriptures in silence, one
tells me, that he <HI>marvels that I am not ashamed to produce,</HI>
Psalme 72. 11. Psalme 86. 9. <HI>to prove that the whole of the Nati∣on,
even infants must be included,</HI> Matth. 28. 19. <HI>As if</HI> (saith
he) <HI>it were foretold that the whole Nation, even Infants should come
before God and worship.</HI> But it is strange, if he be ignorant, that
prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecies in the Od Testament; of the glory of New Testa∣ment-times,
are in Old Testament-phrases by way of allusion
to the worship of those times, set forth to us. It was the pra∣ctice
of the people of the Jewes, for their males of growth
and strength to appear before the Lord, and neither females nor
Infants, as <HI>Ainsworth</HI> on <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 17. observes, yet they appear∣ed
in the name of females and children, and their females and
children, were in covenant, together with them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 11.
so that, as the rest of the prophecies, to which he hath no∣thing
to say, so, these two prophecies (against which he ex∣cepts)
<PB N="239" REF="137"/>
speak fully for the discipling of Nations in New Testa∣ment-times.<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the happy successe that in many Nation hath followed upon it.</NOTE>
The successe of these Prophecies hath happily
answered in many Nations, which may well serve, as a cleare
Comment both of these Prophecies, and the commission grant∣ed
by the Lord Jesus, though by the working of the man of
Sinne, and other Hereticks, the glory hath been much dazeled,
yet, in most of the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> it hath been happily ef∣fected.
Let any man finde equal Reasons for the variation
of the words, as I have done for keeping to the letter of
the Text, then I shall hearken to him, in the meane time
all indifferent men may well challenge their reason that heed
him.</P>
<P>A second Text holding out the covenant in its ancient la∣titude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mat. 22. 14.</NOTE>
we have from our Saviour Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 20. 16</NOTE> <HI>Matth.</HI> 20. 16. and 22.
14. <HI>Many are called, but few chosen.</HI> The close of two several
Parables: The one of the labourers hired into the Vineyard,
where some claimed a more large pay upon merit: The other,
of the Parable of the Wedding-feast, where one intruded with∣out
a Wedding garment; whence our Saviour inferres, <HI>Ma∣ny
are called,</HI> are of the number of guests at the wedding feast, are
of the labourers in the Vineyard, but <HI>few are chosen;</HI> from whence
I thus argue; If there be a call from God in the times of the
New Testament in a farre greater latitude than the grace of E∣lection,
that, of many called, few only are elected; then the
covenant in New Testament-times, is not to be restrained to the
elect and regenerate, but containes all that professedly ac∣cept
the termes of the covenant, and visibly appear a people of
God. This is evident, seeing the call is, into covenant, all at the
Feast were called ones, all the hired labourers were covenant-servants.
To conceive men to be called of God, and not to be
in covenant with God, is a full contradiction. The call hath its
<HI>terminus à quo,</HI> and its <HI>terminus ad quem;</HI> a state which upon call
they leave; and a new state on which they enter. They are up∣on
this call in a nearer relation to God, than the rest of the
world, otherwise they were the same as ever, and not called at
all, they are not in so neare a relation, as men borne of the
Spirit, so they were elected. They have a call by the Word, and
ministerial outward Ordinances, to which they yeeld a profes∣sed
subjection. They have not attained the inward working of
<PB N="240" REF="138"/>
the Spirit to a real Sanctification. Now for the Assumption,
that there is a call in New Testament-times in this latitude, in a
far greater latitude than the grace of Election, our Saviour e∣vidently
shews in the Text quoted; There are those at the feast
that are not accepted; There are those that are taken into the
Vineyard, that at the evening of the day do displease, there are
those therefore that are called into covenant with God, and
yet are rejected of God, a full, and a clear Text for covenant-ho∣linesse.</P>
<P>This is farther evident in those Parables of our Saviour Christ,
of the field with Wheat and Tares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Those sever∣al Parables.</NOTE> <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 24, 25. of the
draw-net with fishes good and bad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 13. 24, 25</NOTE> <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 47. of the floore
with chaffe and Wheat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 13. 47.</NOTE> <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. 12. of the great house, where
there are not only vessels of gold and silver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3. 12.</NOTE> but also of
wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 20.</NOTE> and earth, and stone; some to honour, and some to dis∣honour,
2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 20. In which parables by the floore, the
field (expressely compared to the Kingdome of Heaven, and the
great house) the Church is understood, which stands in covenant-relation
to God, and containes those that are in covenant with
God. A man in the Kingdome of Heaven is a man in covenant
with God, unlesse he stood in a covenant-relation, he could have
no standing there; and the comparison were very strangely drawn,
if this Kingdome thus set out, had all that were good, none
bad in it. But of this more, when I shall speake to some Corolaries
that follow from this Assertion.</P>
<P>Another Scripture, in which the covenant, in the ancient la∣titude
is held out, is <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. thoroughout a great part of the
chapter. There is (as all know) a large discourse of the Apostasie
of the Jews, and the call of the Gentiles, of the rejection and
breaking off of the one; and the taking in, and ingraffing of the
other, which I shall presently have a further occasion to open,
when I shall speak to another pretended difference between the
covenant, as it stood then, and as it stands now. In the meane
time this is clear, into the same Church-state, and covenant-la∣titude
from which the Jews fell, Gentiles were taken in, and do
still continue. This cannot be denied, we being graffed in their
stead, come in upon like termes as they left. They fell from a
visible Church state, and that latitude of covenant which did re∣ceive
regenerate and unregenerate, justified and unjustified. That
<PB N="241" REF="138"/>
covenant-latitude then still remaines in the Churches of the Gen∣tiles
in Gospel-times. Nothing here that I can see can with any co∣lour
be objected, unlesse any will say, that the invisible Church
is there spoken to, and not the visible, that the Jews fell from the
invisible body, and that the Gentiles in their call are generally
taken in, into the same fellowship. Which (as I think) few will
affirme; so I shall have presently occasion to examine. If any
shall further say, that they have this title, in <HI>Foro Ecclesiae,</HI> and
not in <HI>Foro Dei;</HI> as to men they have so far right, that Ministers
may not refuse them, or in their administrations deny them admit∣tance;
but in the sight of God, who knows their unregenerate &amp; un∣justified
condition, they have no title at all, I shall refer them to the
whole tenor of that chapter, where they shall see, this engraffing of
theirs ascribed to the power of God, that it is done by the election
of God, and mentioned as his gift, and choice mercy to that people.
All of which speak the mind of God in it, and his approbation of it.</P>
<P>This is farther clear in that Text of the Apostle, <HI>Heb. 10 29.
Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Heb. 10. 29</NOTE> <HI>shall he be thought worthy,
who hath troden under foot the Sonne of God, and hath counted
the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
thing, and hath done despight unto the Spirit of Grace?</HI> Where we
see those that are sanctified with the blood of the covenant, do
tread under foot the Son of God, and count his blood an unholy
thing, have an esteeme of it, as that which is common, and ne∣ver
devoted at all to God. These must needs be granted to be
wicked, ye cannot be denied to be in covenant, being sancti∣fied
with the blood of the Covenant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A threefold interpretation of the Text.</NOTE> There is indeed
a threefold interpretation of this Text; One of the Arminians,
and those of that party, enemies to perseverance in Grace, and
they understand by sanctification in this place, an internal change
and renovation of the soul, from whence by Apostasie such persons
fall. They that will embrace this tenent, may indeed say, that in
the state of sanctification, they were in covenant, but falling
from sanctification, they fall from covenant. But this is not af∣firmed
by those with whom I have to deale, and therefore I shall
not lanch out into this controversie. Two other interpretations
are given by those that are adversaries to this way, and make it
their work to vindicate this text from these mens glosses; The
first refers sanctification, not to those delinquents, that tread under
<PB N="242" REF="139"/>
<HI>foot the Sonne of God, and do despite unto the Spirit of grace,
but unto Christ himself: Christ was sanctified (they say) with this
blood. This indeed clearly takes this Text out of their hands,
that would from thence inferre the Apostasie of sanctified, that
is, regenerate persons. And if this hold, it as little serves our
purpose, Here is Christ in covenant, but no reprobate or wic∣ked
person in covenant. But this reference of the words and
the interpretation which is grounded on it, hath (I suppose) come
into the thoughts of few Interpreters, and it seemes to be very
much strained, the scope of the place being for aggravation of
their sinne, that set themselves against the Sonne of God and the
holy Spirit. The common interpretation (which is obvious, and
clearly held out in the Text) fully vindicates it from any favour
shew'd to the doctrine of Apostasie of the Saints, and fully con∣firmes
the point in hand. There is a sanctification by separati∣on
for God, and dedication to him, as there is by inhesion
and infusion. Master</HI> Dixon <HI>on the words having so fully
spoke my thoughts, I had rather expresse my selfe in his words,
than my own, putting the Question, How the reprobate can be
said to be sanctified by the blood of the covenant? answers;</HI>
There is a sanctification to the purifying of the flesh, and a sanctifica∣tion
to the purifying of the conscience from dead works, to serve the
living God, <HI>Heb</HI> 9. 13, 14. The sanctification external to the pu∣rifying
of the flesh consisteth in the mans separation from the world,
and dedication unto Gods service, by calling and Covenant,
common to all the members of the visible Church, and it is
forcible thus farre, as to bring a man into credit and estimati∣on
as a Saint before men, and unto the common priviledges of the
Church, whereupon, as men, so God also speaketh unto him, and of him
as one of his people, and dealeth with him in his external dispensation
as with one of his own people. In this sense all the Congregation of
<HI>Israel,</HI> and every one of them is called holy, yea <HI>Core</HI> also and his fol∣lowers,
<HI>Num.</HI> 16. 3. The sanctification internall by renovation consisteth
in a mans separation from the state of nature, to the state of grace, from
his old conditions to be a new creature indeed; by this latter sort a re∣probate
cannot be called sanctified, but by the former he may be called
sanctified, and that by vertue of the blood of the covenant, albeit he
should not get any farther good thereby; for as the blood of Christ hath
vertue to cleanse the conscience, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nue the soul which cometh un∣to
<PB N="243" REF="139"/>
it truely and spiritually, so it must have force to do that which is
lesse, that is, purifie the flesh, and external condition of the man who
cometh unto it, outwardly only as the types did under the Law, where∣upon
an hypocrite in the Christian Church, must be accounted one of the
congregation of the Saints, as well as an hypocrite under the Law was
so called, because Christs blood cannot be inferiour to the Types, which
were of this force to sanctifie men to the purifying of the flesh: Or
we may say more shortly, There is a sanctification by consecration,
when any thing is devoted or dedicated unto God, and a sanctification
by inhabitation of the holy Spirit, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 17. 18. Of the former sort
the Censeres of <HI>Corah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> are called holy, and
the reason is given, Because they offered them before the Lord, there∣fore
they are hallowed, <HI>Num.</HI> 16. 38. And in this sedse all the mem∣bers
of the visible Church, even such as afterwards do prove Apo∣states
are sanctified, because they offered, and offer themselves un∣to
the Lord. But the inhabitation of the holy Spirit, is proper onely to
the elect, and Gods children. <HI>To the same purpose</HI> Paraeus <HI>on the
words,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Erat sanctifi∣catio apostata∣rum non inter∣na sed externa professione fidei et participatione Sacramentorum externa consi∣stens. Erant sanctificati, hoc est, à Judais &amp; Paganus profes∣sione segregati &amp; pro veris Christianis habiti.</NOTE> The sanctification of Apostates was not internal, (<HI>saith he</HI>)
but external, consisting in the profession of Faith and participation
of the Sacraments. They were sanctified, that is, separate from
the Jews and Pagans in profession, and accounted for true Christians.
<HI>In the same sense as men are ordinarily called Saints, as after
we shall hear, so, those that are turned Apostates, were sancti∣fied
by the blood of the covenant, and therefore were men in co∣venant.</HI></P>
<P>Neither can all the noise that hath been made about that Text,
1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 9. adversaries take it off, but that it speaks fully to
hold up a covenant in this latitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</NOTE> and from thence I thus ar∣gue:
If those phrases, <HI>a chosen generation, a royal Priesthood, an
holy Nation, a peculiar people,</HI> be applied to Christians; as to
Jewes, in an equal latitude, to one as to other, then it must needs
follow that there is a covenant in Gospel-times in like latitude,
as in the time of the Law, including all that accept the termes
of the covenant, and visibly appeare as the people of God,
and is not restrained onely to the Elect regenerate. The conse∣quence
is evident, seeing the termes plainly imply a covenant.
Here is a covnant-people or no where. But these termes, <HI>a chosen
Generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People,</HI>
are applied to Christians, as well as to Jewes, to one, in as great a
<PB N="244" REF="140"/>
latitude, as to the other. That which God speaks to <HI>Israel</HI> in the
wildernesse, that <HI>Peter</HI> speaks to the Church to which he writes,
All <HI>Israelites</HI> in <HI>Moses</HI> dayes, all <HI>Christians</HI> professing in <HI>Peters</HI>
time, had those titles, when only those that kept covenant, were
at any time worthy of them, and had the comforts of them.
Here 'tis objected that this Text is meant of the Church, as it
is invisible; and so it follows not, that it is spoken by the Apostle
in that latitude, as it was by <HI>Moses</HI> to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> but in as
great a difference as the Church visible, stands from the Church, as
it is invisible; but I would wish that it might be taken into more
serious consideration.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments carrying this Text to the Church as vi∣sible.</NOTE> whether the first <HI>Verse</HI> of this second <HI>Chapter,</HI> be meant
only of invisible members? Whether the Apostle perswades Re∣generate
men, and only Regenerate men, <HI>to lay aside all malice,
and all guile, and hypocrisies, and evil speakings?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, whether the third <HI>verse</HI> be to be thus limited, whether
the Apostle makes doubt in that manner, whether invisible mem∣bers
<HI>had tasted that the Lord is gracious?</HI> and yet the words in both
those <HI>verses</HI> must needs be understood of the same men, and under
the same notion as these, <HI>ver.</HI> 9. The Apostle brings his speech
to no full period till <HI>ver.</HI> 11. Those that must lay aside all malice,
guile, &amp;c. and those of whom he makes question, whether they
<HI>had tasted that the Lord were gracious;</HI> are this chosen Generation,
this royal Priest-hood.</P>
<P>Thirdly, let us more seriously consider the Apostles farther en∣largement
of this honour of these Christians, <HI>Which in times past
were not a people of God;</HI> words borrowed from <HI>Hos. 1. 10. Hos</HI> 2. 23
and spoken of the call of the ten revolted Tribes, and in <HI>Deut.</HI>
32. 21. of the call of the Gentiles into a visible Church-state
and profession, and so applied by the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 24, 25, 26.
Whence I argue, The call of the ten revolted Tribes, and of the
Gentiles into a visible Church-way, is not to be meant of the
Church, as it is invisible onely. This one hath already taken in∣to
consideration, and answered. <HI>Howsoever it be in the places in
which the allusion is, yet it is certaine that here it is meant of such a
calling as is from darknesse to marvellous light.</HI> Taking it, it seems,
for granted, that there is no marvelous light in visible Churches,
that in the land of <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Nepthali,</HI> where they saw a great
light, there were, only invisible members, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 15, 16.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="140"/>
Fourthly, as honourable titles as these are frequently given in
Scripture, as shall be shewn to visible professours, why should
then these be limitted to invisible Members?</P>
<P>Fifthly, this Text by adversaries is made to be parallel with
those Texts, <HI>Gal. 6. 10. 1 Tim. 3. 15. 1 Pet.</HI> 2. 20. And
those Texts I have demonstrated to be meant of visible Churches.
To which nothing is replyed. Arguments to evince it,
to be meant of the Church, as it is invisible, come to be consi∣dered.</P>
<P>(1.) <HI>I argue</HI> (saith one) <HI>from the termes, chosen Generation,
royal Priesthood,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Objections answered."/> <HI>and holy Nation, a peculiar people.</HI> This is by Christs
death, which can be understood of no other than Elect and true
Beleevers <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. 14.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Such a way of arguing would not passe with him
in his <HI>Adversary.</HI> As [peculiar people] is taken in one place
of Scripture, so it must be taken in all places; but in one place it is
taken for the Elect regenerate. If this would hold, much labour
might be spared in finding out the various acception of words in
Scripture.</P>
<P>2. These termes and others equipollent to these, are given to
the <HI>Israelites, Deut. 14. 1, 2. Deut. 9. 6. Deut.</HI> 32. 9. not as a
Church invisible, but as visible Members. Their qualifications are
often as low as their appellations by reason of their relation to
God, raise them high. And setting apart Christs death, I would
know how the <HI>Israelites</HI> came to this honour.</P>
<P>3. The gift of Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastours and
Teachers were the gift of Christ, and the purchase of his death.
These are for constitution of visible Churches, and visible members,
enjoy these priviledges in common with regenerate persons, to
which more is already spoken.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>An Objection is raised from that which is said of them,</HI>
They are called of God by his power, and vertue into his marvelous
light; and <HI>verse</HI> 10. Which now had obtained mercy, which they
had not before, which cannot be affirmed of any but true Beleevers
and Elect persons.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Men brought into a visible Church-state, are brought
into a marvelous light. The seven golden Candlesticks, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.
20. had a marvelous light in their lamps, and yet in some of
those there were onely <HI>a few names that had not defiled their gar∣ments;</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="141"/>
And this light is a mercy, the fruition of it is a great mer∣cy,
<HI>Psalme</HI> 147. 19, 20. Yea, it is applied by the Prophet, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.
23. whence the Apostle gathers it unto the mercy enjoyed in
a visible Church-communion, which is not denied by the adver∣sary.</P>
<P>(3.) <HI>It is said, that</HI> those persons did beleeve contra-distinguish∣ed
to them that were disobedient, and stumbled at the word; but such
are onely the Elect. <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> So did all they that <HI>made shipwrack of the faith,</HI> 1 Tim.
1. 19. So did <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> Acts 8. 13. So did the hearers com∣pared
to the rocky ground, <HI>Luke</HI> 8. 13. And whereas it is said,
these Beleevers are contra-distinguished to them that were diso∣bedient
and stumbled at the Word, it fully makes against this in∣terpretation.
Those disobedient ones are, those that disallow Christ,
as we see <HI>verse</HI> 7. that reject Christ upon tender, that persist in
<HI>Judaisme</HI> or <HI>Gentilisme.</HI> All others, not professed Jewes nor
Gentiles, are in that place Beleevers, and in all other Scriptures
respective to visible prerogative, all which are visible Church-members.</P>
<P>(4.) They are said to be built, as living stones, &amp;c. which can a∣gree
to none, but Elect persons, and true Beleevers.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That is left out, in the Quotation of this Text, which
would wholly spoile the argument, and carry it on the other
hand; namely those words, <HI>To whom coming as unto a living
stone.</HI> The Apostle shews them the way, and points out the
condition called for, which being done, they are then built as
living stones. And this implies that it was so, with some, but not
with others. Here is that which was done by some and neglected
by others, and their happinesse upon discharge of their duty de∣clared.
I am told by one, that he hardly beleeves, that any ap∣proved
Writer joyns with me in this Interpretation; But though
I were alone in it, yet I might learne of him to adventure, not bare∣ly
on the interpretation of one single-Scripture-Text, but on a con∣clusion
in Theology, against all Protestant Writers, and here∣in
I should have the advantage, in that few comparatively (I
think) have started this question, much lesse have they seri∣ously
handled it, minding more what those titles engage us to be
(in which there is an agreement of all parties) than to whom they
are given, when some of my opposites, dare affront the whole bo∣dy
<PB N="247" REF="141"/>
of Protestant Writers, in that, in which <HI>ex professo,</HI> they have
to deale against Papists. <HI>Estius</HI> indeed upon examination of the
thing in question, appeares to be of a contrary minde, and cen∣sures
those that set <HI>out this holinesse by Religion, doctrine, Sacra∣ments,</HI>
which Authours by him thus censured, may be (for ought
I know) as approved as himself, and they, as we see, limit it not
to the Church invisible, I doubt not, but that holinesse, which is
intrinsecal, is here aimed at, yet all those have these titles, that do
make profession of the way of it, and are of the number of those
that engage themselves to it. <HI>Gerrard</HI> also on the words, puts
it to the question, and determines the same way, but tells us of
others, that understand it of common and general election, His
name (I suppose) is waved in that his Arguments are borrowed,
and have been answered. But on the other hand Master <HI>Ball</HI>
(who if authorities must carry it, will sway with me as much as ei∣ther)
treating on those words, <HI>Hos. 2. 19, 20. I will betroth thee
unto me for ever, &amp;c.</HI> saith, <HI>The external betrothing, by outward co∣venant,
so as God betroths himselfe to all professing the true faith,
may be broken, for though God offer them mercy if they will believe,
yet he gives not not faith to them, and quotes for proof,</HI> Rom. 9.
24, 25. 1 Pet. 2. 8, 9. And <HI>Zanchius de perseverantia sanctorum</HI>
cap. 1. <HI>Tit. de Sanctis,</HI> hath these words, <HI>Hear now what I un∣derstand
by the name of [Saints] This name [Saint] when it is
spoken of men, is, 1, Generally taken, for all those that have con∣secrated
themselves to the true God, and given their name to Christ,
and do professe him and his Religion, whether it be done before God
truely, and sincerely, or only before men, so the people of</HI> Israel, <HI>al∣though
they were not all truely holy, yet they are all called holy, so</HI>
Paul <HI>calls all those Saints, who had given their names to Christ;
so</HI> Peter, 1 <HI>Pet. 2 calls all those Christians to whom he writes a ho∣ly
Nation, and a royal Priesthood.</HI> And <HI>Laurentius,</HI> 1 Pet. 1. 1.
page 6. distinguishing of a threefold election. 1. <HI>To any functi∣on,
civil or ecclesiastical. 2. To the external communion of divine
worship, or the outward Church or people of God. 3. To salvation
and eternal life,</HI> brings for proof of the second acceptation, <HI>Deut.
7. 6. 1 Pet.</HI> 2. 9. both which Texts, with him there, are parallel;
and taken in the same sense that I understand them. <HI>Ravanellus
in verbum [election]</HI> quotes divers Texts of Scripture, in which e∣lection
is taken <HI>for the adoption of any Nation,</HI> and puts this of
<PB N="248" REF="142"/>
1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 9. in the last place, adding these words, <HI>And this election
is general as hath been said, nor are all that are made partakers
of it, necessarily saved,</HI> Rom. 9. 6. <HI>but respective to this general e∣lection,
he is said to be chosen of God, who is called to the participation
of his free covenant, or a people whom God adopts to himself for a peo∣ple.</HI>
So also <HI>in verbum [Sanctus,]</HI> which he sayes is taken three
wayes. 1. <HI>By separation or segregation. 2. By imputation. 3. By
inchoation of holinesse in this life.</HI> He there gives many instances
of the first acception, of holinesse by separation, distinct from the
two other, and 1 <HI>Pet</HI> 2. 9. for one. So <HI>Salmero,</HI> as I finde him
quoted to my hand, understands it of election, distinct from that
which is to eternal life; and calls it an election to <HI>faith,</HI> and all
know that they mean no more than their Catholick faith, which
(according to them) doth not necessarily entitle to eternal life,
<HI>A Lapide,</HI> with whom my adversaries in these controversies, fre∣quently
joyn, is also wholly on my part, in his Comment on these
words, so that it needed not to have been said, that no approved
authour joynes with me, Let the Reader judge as the strength of
reasons given will perswade.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arguments evincing the Covenant of Grace in Gospel-times
in that latitude as before is asserted.</HEAD>
<P>THe first Argument shall be borrowed from those titles,
which undoubtedly and undisputably imply a covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Titles given to men in co∣venant, and in Scripture ap∣plied to unre∣generate men, prove it.</NOTE> and
yet in Scripture, are still attributed to all that professedly
accept the termes of the covenant, and professedly appear as the
people of God. Those titles before mentioned by <HI>Peter</HI>
from <HI>Moses,</HI> are confessed to be such that argue a people in cove∣nant,
and therefore adversaries are so shie to confesse them to be∣long
to visible Professours; But titles as high as these,
and as undeniably implying a covenant, are given to visible Pro∣fessours;
those then (even according to them) are on this ac∣count
in covenant with God. And these are all of those titles wher∣with
the people of God are honoured. In New Testament-Scriptures,
<PB N="249" REF="142"/>
which are especially foure, <HI>Beleevers, Saints, Dis∣ciples,
Christians.</HI> He that is a <HI>Beleever,</HI> a <HI>Saint,</HI> a <HI>Disciple,</HI> a
<HI>Christian;</HI> he is a man in covenant with God. But all visible
Professors that accept the termes of the covenant are <HI>Beleevers,
Saints, Disciples, Christians;</HI> so they are still stiled in New
Testament-Scriptures, <HI>Beleevers</HI> from the Faith that they pro∣fesse,
<HI>Saints</HI> from the Holinesse to which they stand engaged,
or from the holy God to whose service they are separated,
<HI>Disciples</HI> from the Doctrine which they professe to learne, and
<HI>Christians</HI> from him whose they are, whom they serve, and
from whom they expect salvation. I know some have inured
themselves to that language, that those that are thus dignified, are
necessarily concluded by them to be Elect, Regenerate persons;
It is grown, I know the Dialect of the times, but not of the
Scriptures.</P>
<P>To begin with <HI>Beleevers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unregenerate persons, as to the name and outward privi∣ledges, are Beleevers.</NOTE> He is in Scripture a Beleever, that is,
a visible Professour, that puts himself into the number of those that
expect salvation by Christ Jesus, So it is through the History of
the <HI>Acts,</HI> where account is given of the Converts made by the
Apostles Ministry, <HI>Acts 4. 4. Many of them which heard the Word
believed, and the number of the men was about five thousand.</HI> They
that are thus numbred by the poll, are visible Professours, that
outwardly embraced the Doctrine of Faith; This might be seene
and the names of such taken. They are not all Elect, regenerate
Christians, such could not be visibly known: The generality of
men and women in <HI>Samaria</HI> beleeved, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 12. But that they
were Elect &amp; Regenerate in that universality cannot be conceived;
<HI>Simon Magus</HI> is an example to the contrary, of whom the Text
sayes, <HI>that he did beleeve,</HI> vers. 13. and <HI>yet his heart not right in the
sight of God,</HI> vers. 21. He was with those <HI>Israelites,</HI> Psalme 78.
34. in covenant; <HI>yet his heart was not stedfast in Covenant.</HI> A great
number of the <HI>Grecians</HI> beleeved, upon the preaching of those that
were scattered, upon the persecution raised about <HI>Stephen,</HI> Acts
11. 21. yet <HI>Barnabas</HI> (whom the Church of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> sent to
them) well enough knew, that there was no certainty, little hopes
that all of these were Regenerate persons; therefore he <HI>exhorts
them, that with purpose of heart they would cleave to the Lord.</HI> He
was afraid that the work might be overly and superficial, of which
the Church in every age hath sad experience; he desires and en∣deavour
<PB N="250" REF="143"/>
that they may be rooted and established. Only those
hearers which are compared to the good ground, are Regenerate
persons, But those compared to bad ground, beleeve, <HI>Luke</HI> 8.
13. Regenerate men, who alone are invisible Church-Members,
have their hearts more right with God, than to love the praise of
men, more than the praise of God; but many beleevers are thus
censured, as we see, <HI>John</HI> 12. 42, 43. Regenerate persons make no
shipwrack of Faith; <HI>They are borne of incorruptible seed, the seed
of God abideth in them;</HI> Yet there are beleevers that thus suffer
shipwrack, 1 <HI>Tim. 1. 19. Myriads of thousand of Jews beleeve,</HI>
Acts 21. 20. yet not all Regenerate. The Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. sa∣tisfies
a case of conscience put to him by the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that if
any brother hath a wife that beleeveth not; if she be pleased to
dwell with him, let him not put her away. If the beleeving bro∣ther,
here be only a Regenerate man, then the unbeleeving wife
is an unregenerate woman; So the question will be, whether a
Regenerate, sanctified man, joyned in marriage to a Professour of
the true faith, not of those hopes for the truth of sanctification
may dwell with her? A case that never yet was disputed or doubt∣ed:
The unbeleever is a worshipper of idols, one that sacrifices
to devils, and not to God. The Beleever is a Professor of the Faith,
one in name a Christian and not a Heathen.</P>
<P><HI>Saint</HI> is taken in the same latitude as <HI>Beleever,</HI> and is the most
common appellation in the New Testament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unregenerate persons, as to the name and outward privi∣ledges are Saints.</NOTE> for all that are se∣parate
for God, and dedicated to him. The distinguishing name
for professing Christians, as the title of <HI>People of God, Circumcision,</HI>
was for the people of <HI>Israel;</HI> some do not hear of the word <HI>Saint,</HI>
but presently they understand a Saint in glory, and will not en∣dure
that any man should be a Saint upon earth; Others will
have none Saints, but those that are really such, and shall be for
heaven. They will have no denomination of a Saint, from a holy
profession: But if we look into the Scriptures, and may be
suffered to speak in that language, we shall finde, <HI>Saint</HI> for the
most part, taken for men upon the earth. The psalmist profes∣sedly
names <HI>Saints upon earth,</HI> Psal. 16. 3. And those Saints not of∣ten
taken for other, than a Saint by profession. He is a
Saint that makes a Christian profession. We read of <HI>Colle∣ctions
for the Saints,</HI> 1 Cor. 16. 1. <HI>Administration to the Saints,</HI> Heb.
6. 10. which can reach no higher than visible Professours, and
<PB N="251" REF="143"/>
can by no means be limited to Elect, Regenerate ones. When <HI>Paul
shut up many of the Saints in prison, and did much evil against them,</HI>
Acts 26. 10. he knew no other way of distiction; then an outward
profession, and so he explaines himself, <HI>those of that way,</HI> Act. 9. 2.
We read <HI>of Churches of the Saints,</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 33. and they were
taken in, to be Church-members assoon as they made profession;
that is assoon as they ceased to be Jews or Pagans, and took them
to the way of Christianity. As we see in those three thousand,
<HI>Acts</HI> 2. The Samaritans, The Eunuch, <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> as∣soon
as they were taken off from Heathenisme, Judaisme for
Christianity, they had that name of Saints. The Epistles wrote to
particular visible Churchs, are inscribed <HI>to Saints,</HI> among which,
what some are, read both the Epistles to the <HI>Corinthians;</HI> yea,
what almost all are in some Churches, read the Epistle to the
Church of <HI>Sardis. Amesius</HI> judged by some to be of the opposite
party) hath these words; <HI>It is most probable, that there is no
particular Church, in which the profession of the true faith flourisheth,
but in the same we may finde some truly Beleevers,</HI> Medul. lib. 1.
cap. 32. sect. 8. The Apostle tells us <HI>of the Faith once delivered to
the Saints.</HI> Jude 3. the Doctrine of Faith, as is agreed on all
hands is there understood; All that professe that Doctrine are
Saints: no other Comment can be put upon it, than upon the A∣postles
words, <HI>Rom. 3. 1. To the Jews were committed the Oracles of
God;</HI> Saint then is a name of distinction, to set out those that take
the way, not of Jews, or Heathens, but the way of Christians and
Saints are men in covenant.</P>
<P>For the terme <HI>Disciple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unregenerate persons, as to the name and outward privi∣ledges, are Disciples.</NOTE> enough hath been spoken before. This
argues an interest in the covenant, as well as the former of <HI>Saints,</HI>
and <HI>Beleevers,</HI> and whole Nations are in capacity to be Disciples,
<HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. that is, to be put into a way of salvation, as some∣times
the Nation of the Jews was, in the fruition of saving Ordinan∣ces;
And the Kingdomes of the earth, being made the Kingdoms of
the Lord and his Christs, by a visible profession are Discipled.
<HI>Judas</HI> is called a Disciple, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 1, 4. as well as <HI>Simon Ma∣gus</HI>
is called a Beleever. <HI>Saul</HI> breathed out threatnings against
the Disciples of the Lord, <HI>Acts</HI> 9. 1. In case you will know who
the holy Ghost there means, see <HI>verse</HI> 2. all that <HI>Saul</HI> could
finde of that way. He made it not his work to enquire after their
Regeneration, or inward work of Sanctification; we may well
<PB N="252" REF="144"/>
think he understood as little of that as <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> It was enough
to him that they made such a profession. Complaint is made, <HI>Acts</HI>
15. 10. that those that urged the necessity of circumcision, <HI>put
a yoke on the necks of the Disciples, which neither they nor their fa∣thers
were able to bear;</HI> and they urged it upon all in visible profes∣sion,
and not upon regenerate ones alone. Let that one Text speak
for all, in what latitude the word Disciple is taken, and in how
large comprehension it is used, <HI>John 6. 66. From that time many of
his Disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</HI></P>
<P>For the last of these termes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unregenerate persons, as to the name and outward privi∣ledges are Christians.</NOTE> <HI>Christians,</HI> it stands in the same lati∣tude
as the other, where we first heare of it, we finde it the same
with <HI>Disciples,</HI> Acts 11. 26. <HI>The Disciples were first called Christi∣ans
in Antioch.</HI> And in what acception through all ages it hath past,
is also manifest. All of these imply an interest in the covenant,
and these are given to unregenerate persons.</P>
<P>Here that of our Saviour is objected,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Luke 14. 27, 33. If any
man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
children, and brethren, and sisters; yea, and his own life also, he can∣not
be my Disciple. These qualifications are signes of Regeneration,
and these only that are thus qualified,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> <HI>are Disciples of Christ; Rege∣nerate
men then onely have that honour of Disciples.</HI> I answer, They
only do the duty of Disciples, they onely are worthy of that title
as Christ explaines himself, <HI>Mat. 10. 37. He that loveth father or
mother more than me, is not worthy of me;</HI> Yet others have the name,
as we have heard, and the outward priviledges, in order to bring
them to the duty of true Disciples. There are Disciples as to the
fruition of visible priviledges, and those are they that make vi∣sible
professions. There are Disciples for glory and life, and those
onely are Regenerate ones, <HI>John 3. 3. Except a man be borne again, he
cannot see the Kingdome of God.</HI> Ordinances are granted in a greater
latitude than Regeneration. All that enjoy the priviledges of Or∣dinances
are Disciples, and therefore it is no honour proper to Re∣generate
persons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The absurdi∣ties that follow upon the re∣striction of the Covenant to the Elect Re∣generate do evince it.</NOTE></P>
<P>Secondly, as these titles argue a covenant-interest, when the
parties are yet short of Regeneration; so the manifold absurdities
that will follow upon this restraint of the covenant, alone to Re∣generate,
plainly evince that it is to be taken in a larger extent, and
that it takes in unregenerate Professours.</P>
<P>1. <HI>This restriction of the covenant, to out shut all non-Rege∣nerate,
<PB N="253" REF="144"/>
makes an utter confusion between the covenant it selfe,
and the conditions of it; or (if that expression do not please)
the covenant it self; and the duties required in it, between our
entrance into covenant, and our observation of it, or walking
up in faithfulnesse to it. All know that a bargaine for a summe of
money, and the payment of that summe, the covenant with a
servant for labour, and the labour according to this covenant,
are different things. Faithful men that make a bargaine, keep it,
enter covenant, and stand to it; But the making and keeping,
the entring and observing are not the same, many enter and
transgresse, covenant for much, and performe nothing; So it is
in the covenants of men, and so Scripture speaks of those cove∣nants
which God enters with man. There are those that enter
covenant, and keep covenant,</HI> Psal. 44. 17, 18. All this is come
upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely
in thy covenant; our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps
declined from thy way. <HI>These have mercy promised; All to which
God enegages himself, is theirs,</HI> Psalme 103. 17, 18. The meecy of
the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting, upon them that fear him;
and his righteousnesse unto childrens children, to such as keep his co∣venant,
and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
<HI>There are those that break covenant,</HI> Psal. 78. 10, 37. They kept
not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his Law. Their heart
was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
<HI>And these are threatned with a curse,</HI> Jer. 34. 18, 19, 20. And I
will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have
not performed the words of the covenant, which they had made before
me, when they cut the calfe in twaine, and passed between the parts
thereof. The Princes of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the Princes of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the Eu∣nuches
and the Priests, and all the people of the land, which passed
between the parts of the calf: I will even give them into the hand of
their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life;
and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowles of the heaven,
and to the beasts of the earth. <HI>The Lord brings a sword</HI> that
avenges the quarrel of his covenant, <HI>Levit. 26. 25. When the
heaviest of judgements is mentioned, and a large list enumera∣ted,
as</HI> Esay 24. Behold the Lord maketh the earth empty, and
maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad
the inhabitants thereof. And it shall be as with the People, so with the
<PB N="254" REF="145"/>
Priest; as with the Servant, so with his Master; as with the Maid,
so with her Mistresse; as with the Buyer, so with the Seller; as with
the Lender, so with the Borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with
the giver of usury; to him the land shall be utterly empited, and ut∣terly
spoiled, for the Lord hath spoken this word. The earth mourn∣eth
and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish, the
earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof. Therefore hath
the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate;
therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burnt, and few men left;
the new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted
do sigh. The myrth of Tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoyce
endeth, the joy of the Harp ceaseth; They shal not drink wine with a song,
strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. The city of confusion
is broken down, every house is shut up, that no man may come in. There
is a crying for wine in the streets, all joy is darkned, the mirth of the
land is gone: In the City is left desolation, and the Gate is smitten
with destruction. <HI>The reason of all this is given in the close of</HI>
verse 5. Because they have transgressed the Laws, changed the Or∣dinances,
broken the everlasting Covenant. <HI>Now according to this
opinion, Regeneration is our entrance into covenant, and Rege∣neration
is our keeping of covenant; before regeneration we make
no covenant, after Regeneration we break no covenant, there is
no such thing as covenant-breaking. All this makes an utter con∣fusion
in the covenant.</HI></P>
<P>2. Then there is no such thing as an hypocrite in the world, as
in reference towards God; no such thing as an hypocrite in the
Church as in reference to Religion, and wayes of godlinesse. An
hypocrite is one that personates the man that he is not, with <HI>Jero∣boams</HI>
wife, feignes himself to be another person, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 14. 6.
He that acts <HI>Tarquin</HI> or <HI>Lucretia</HI> in the Tragedy, is not <HI>Tarquin</HI> or
<HI>Lucretia,</HI> that acts a King is many times a peasant. Now an hy∣pocrite
respective to Religion, and in Scripture use of the phrase, is
one that pretends for God, and is not Gods; pretends to be whol∣ly
his, and is some others; of these God frequently complaines,
These in the Scriptures are menaced with heavy judgements. Now
according to this opinion, that only Regenerate men are in co∣venant,
there is no such thing as an hypocrite, No such sinne as
hypocrisie; Where the Gospel is preached, God makes tender of
himself in covenant; and in case none but Regenerate enter Co∣venant,
<PB N="255" REF="145"/>
then only they take upon them the persons of people in
relation to him, onely they strike hands with him, and these, as
they <HI>professe,</HI> so in sincerity and reality they <HI>are;</HI> as they cove∣nant
with him, so in the uprightnesse of their hearts they walk
before him, and so all of <HI>Israel,</HI> are <HI>Israel.</HI> There cannot be found
a man in <HI>Israel</HI> that is not a <HI>Nathaniel;</HI> Men out of covenant, are
without, and aliens to the Common-wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> Ephes. 2. 12.
And if they be in covenant, then according to this opinion, they
are men sincere, and upright-hearted in it. But you will say,
<HI>They pretend to the covenant, and are not in covenant, and so are hy∣pocrites.</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/>
To this I say. (1.) It is plain against the Scriptures, that
makes hypocrites false in the covenant, men whose hearts were
not stedfast in it, as <HI>Psalme 78. 8, 10 a stubborne and rebel∣lious
generation, a generation that set not their heart aright, and
whose spirit was not stedfast with God. They kept not the cove∣nant
of God, and refused to walk in his Law.</HI> More fully, <HI>verse
36, 37. They did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto
him with their tongues, for their hearts were not right with him, neither
were they stedfast in his covenant.</HI> Therefore they pretend not bare∣ly
to a covenant, but the covenant which they enter, is their pre∣tence
for God, and their breach of covenant argues them guilty of
hypocrisie before the Lord. (2) According to these such pretend
to the stage, but are never admitted on it. They pretend to act the
part of a Servant of God, but never act in it; so we may say, they
pretend to hypocrisie, but never are in the honour to be in any ca∣pacity
of it.</P>
<P>3. If the covenant be with this limit, only to Regenerate per∣sons,
then no Minister in any Church, no Church-Officer, nor any
other Church-member, in case you will make it to be their work,
may baptize any person. That Disciples are to be baptized, is
out of question with all that acknowledge such a standing Ordi∣nance
as Baptisme; It being in the Apostles commission, <HI>to disci∣ple
Nations, and baptize them.</HI> These are brought into the bond of
the covenant, as <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20. 37. But those only, passing for Di∣sciples,
and men in covenant that are Regenerate, they can by
no eye of any Minister, Church-Officer, or member be discerned.
This is that work that <HI>cometh not with observation, or outward shew,
that men should say, so here, or so there,</HI> Luke 17. 20, 21. Christ might
indeed have baptized in his own person at pleasure, seeing <HI>he
<PB N="256" REF="146"/>
knew what was in man,</HI> John 2. 2. He could have distinguished
a Beleever from an unbeleever, a Saint from an unsanctified
man, a Christian from him that is no Christian, a Disciple from
one that is no Disciple, taking these titles in the sense of
these persons. So can no other man. It is the Prerogative Royal
of God to search the heart; If <HI>Paul</HI> could have discerned false
Brethren by a spirit of infallibility, he had never been in that
danger, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26. But Christ baptized none, but left all to
his Disciples, <HI>John</HI> 4. 2. And they being thus tied up, to baptize
none, till they be discipled; of which according to this Tenent
they could be no competent Judges, it must needs follow that
none at all must be baptized. If any say, those are to be baptized,
that in the judgement of charity we judge to be Disciples, on
whom we have grounds of hope that this work is wrought, as I
know it is said by many, I shall give heed to them when they can
shew that Christ hath said it, that he hath made known that
the inward work, is alone the true ground, on which this privi∣ledge is granted, and charity is our rule in judging of it; But I
finde Christ giving charge to Disciple Nations, and to baptize
them; But I finde him not giving commission, that when in the
judgement of charity, men have cause to conceive them to be Di∣sciples,
then to baptize them; We finde the Apostles and others
in the Primitive-times, making that haste to baptize upon profes∣sion,
that they stayed not for observation of those signes that
might in a well-grounded charity perswade that they were Re∣generate
persons. And those that fix it here, too ordinarily, make
interests the chief ground to carry their charity to a more favour∣able
construction; charity (according to the Proverb) begin∣ning
at home, they that are most like to make a party with them,
or drive on an interest their way, will be judged persons meet
for Baptisme; Of this in a short time we have large experience.
As for those that gather up Churches, and initiate them by Ba∣ptisme,
the way of the Apostles, I confesse, in case that they would
make good that they have to deale with Heathens, and therefore
a way of more colour than theirs, that set up new Churches,
and retaine the old Baptisme, we see what manner of Saints are
received among them▪ such that civil persons (respective to so∣briety,
chastity, or upright dealing with men) cannot without
staine of their reputation, make their companions. And congre∣gations
<PB N="257" REF="146"/>
of Saints have just cause to say, that they have lost none
of their gold, but much of their filth and drosse by such Saint-separation;
That I speak the truth, and lie not, I need not to
appeal to my conscience bearing witnesse, (which alone is satisfa∣ction
to my self) but to thousands of witnesses which may give
satisfaction to others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Objections against this latitude of the Covenant
answered.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT is here objected, that</HI> in Old Testament-times, God speaks to all
in visible profession, in that way of compellation as his people, as
appears in those places that alreadie have been quoted; but in New
Testament-times, we finde not that title in such generality, only the
Regenerate, those that yield ready and loyal subjection to God, are
honoured with the name of the people of God, they therefore onlie are
in Covenant. <HI>The title is restrained peculiarly to them, and so
also the mercy. To this much may be said.</HI></P>
<P>First, if this were granted, that this way of compellation, or
speech of God to man, is not found in all the New Testament, in
this latitude, as to take in men of Christian Profession, not yet re∣generate,
yet there is little gained, seeing as we have found,
there are termes equivalent. Beleevers are the people of God,
so are Saints, Disciples, and Christians. But those that are yet
unregenerate have these titles, as we have heard at large, and
therefore it argues the Covenant to be as large, as when that
terme was so frequent.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is not often, that that phrase is found in New Te∣stament-Scriptures,
with such restriction, only to regenerate
persons, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. 14. is the most pregnant place, where it is
said, that Jesus Christ <HI>gave himself for us, that he might redeem
us from all iniquitie, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people, zeal∣ous
of good works.</HI> But if it be granted, that it is sometimes taken
for a people separate by grace out of the state of nature, it will
<PB N="258" REF="147"/>
not follow that it is never taken for a people separate for God by
Profession; I know that Text, <HI>Revelation</HI> 21. 3. will be urged,
<HI>I heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, Behold, the Ta∣bernacle
of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and
be their God.</HI> But this will hardly serve for their purpose, There is
no small dispute whether this be to be fulfilled on Earth, or in
Heaven; if in Heaven, as learned Interpreters contend, then
it is nothing to our purpose; if on Earth, then it sets out a sin∣gular
glory in the Church through Ordinances in purity; no∣thing
that offends being suffered, yet such a one in which yet
there is a mixture of close hypocrites: As for those that interpret
it of Christs personal reigne upon earth, when he in person shall
manage all, and work nothing by his Agents, I leave them to
enjoy their own opinion, how they shall be qualified on
earth that do attend him. But if we may make conjecture by
a considerable party of those that publish it, and receive it,
we shall have strong cause of doubt, that all will not be found re∣generate.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I say, the expression mentioned of <HI>my people, or
people of God,</HI> is used more frequently in the New Testament
in the Old Testament-latitude, than with restriction to the
Elect Regenerate. That in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 16. with me is plain;
<HI>I will dwell with them, and walk in them, and I will be their God,
and they shall be my people,</HI> quoted out of an Old Testament-Scri∣pture,
<HI>Levit.</HI> 26. 16. and there it is a National Promise, and
here, to be understood of Gods visible abode in Ordinances, as
may be made out from the context, being tendered to those that
were over-busie to meddle with idols, from which he disswades
with this Argument, that they were the Temple of the Lord, se∣parate
of God for his worship and service, and the Promise
is no more than is made good to visible Churches; <HI>Christ
walks in the midst of the seven golden Candlesticks,</HI> Revel. 2. 1.
and some of them (witnesse that of <HI>Sardis</HI>) had not all their
Members Regenerate persons. That of the Apostle, <HI>Rom. 9.
25. I will call them my people, which were not my people, and
her beloved, which was not beloved,</HI> is to be understood no o∣therwise;
That of the Prophet of the call of the ten Tribes,
from <HI>Hosea 1. 10. Hos.</HI> 2. 23. is there applied to the call
<PB N="259" REF="147"/>
of the Gentiles into a Church-state and condition. Neither
is that of force against it, that is objected from <HI>verse</HI> 23.
where the Apostle saith, <HI>That he might make known the riches of
his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared
unto glory.</HI> God sets up visible Ordinances, and calls to a
Church-state as is there prophecied, that he may there work
to himselfe a people of invisible relation, that thereby he may
make them vessels of mercy, having afore prepared them
unto glory; So likewise, <HI>Rev. 18. 4. Come out of her my
people, that ye be not partakers of her sinnes, and that ye re∣ceive
not of her plagues.</HI> All Professours of faith, and wor∣shippers
of the true God, are there included in that ex∣hortation
to quit <HI>Babylon;</HI> so all Ministers of Christ are
to urge and presse it; Men therefore of visible Professi∣on,
have this title in compellation from GOD of my
people.</P>
<P>It is yet objected, <HI>Jeremiah 31. 31, 32, 33. Behold the
dayes come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new Covenant
with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, not ac∣cording
to the Covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day
that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land
of Egypt; which my Covenant they brake, although I was an
husband to them, saith the Lord. But this shall be my Covenant
that I will make with the house of Israel; after those dayes saith
the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write
it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my
people.</HI> Here is a third purpose or interest for which this Text is
produced to serve. The first was to assert an unconditionate
Covenant in the dayes of the Gospel, (which we examined
<HI>chapter</HI> 25.) when the Gospel expressely holds out Covenant-conditions,
more expressely than the Covenant of Works, which
is confest to be conditional. The second to overthrow a pub∣lick
Ministery, and all private mutual exhortation (which we
spake to <HI>chapter</HI> 26) when the New Testament doth establish
both. And to set up this Prophecie in a third particular, a∣gainst
all New Testament-light; none must be of the called of
God into Covenant, for fruition of Church-priviledges, but
those that are regenerate: Men in Old Testament-Covenant,
broke Covenant as is there exprest; Men in the New Covenant
<PB N="260" REF="148"/>
shall keep covenant, and these are only the Elect and Regene∣rate.
To this I might have many things to say.</P>
<P>No such sense must be put upon this one single Text, as to re∣strain
the covenant only to those that are stedfast in it, and care∣fully
observe it when other New-Testament-Scriptures clearly and
unanimously hold it out in that latitude to comprehend those
that are transgressours of it, no more than it must be brought
(though there be like colour for both) to overthrow Gospel-Or∣dinances
private and publick exhortations, when in the New Te∣stament
there is a clear and full establishment of them.
There are those that are in the faith, so farre as to enter
Covenant, <HI>that make shipwrack of the faith,</HI> 1 Tim 1. 19. Dis∣ciples
of Christ, <HI>that go back and walk no more with him▪</HI> Joh. 6. Men
sanctified by the blood of the Covenant, <HI>that tread under foot the
blood of the Son of God, and do despight to the Spirit of grace,</HI> Heb.
10. 29. There are that <HI>escape the pollution of the world, through
the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and are
again entangled and overcome. Those that have known the way
of righteousnesse, that turne from the holy Commandment. To
whom it happens according to the true Proverb, The dogge is
turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed
to her wallowing in the mire,</HI> 2 Pet. 2 22. It is farre easier to
returne answer to this Scripture held out by way of Prophe∣cie
what shall be, than to give answer to all these Scriptures,
and far more than these, setting out what is in New Testament-times.</P>
<P>2. That we may interpret, and not commit Scriptures, finde
out the sense of all, and not create differences in any; we may
observe that though it be granted, that those that have the
Law written in their hearts, and put into their inward parts,
do enter covenant, and not break it; yet it is not said, none
shall enter covenant and transgresse it. There may still be an
outward covenant, according to Interpreters, that may be
broken, as well as an inward covenant that shall be observed.
If it be said, that these are two distinct covenants, one
succeeding the other; one abolished when the other takes
place, according to that of the Apostle, <HI>Heb. 8. 13. In that
he saith, a New Covenant, he hath made the first Old; now
that which decayeth and waxeth Old, is ready to vanish a∣way;</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="148"/>
then it will follow (this being the characteristical dif∣ference)
that, as none in New Testament-times enter cove∣nant,
but they keep covenant; so none in Old Testament-times
were in covenant, but they did transgresse it; at least
that the covenant that then was, was wholly transgresse∣able;
and the covenant that now is, is not in any possibi∣lity
to be transgrest. But the contrary is evident, there were
those that kept covenant in Old Testament-times, <HI>Psal. 44. 17.
All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotton thee, neither
have we dealt falsely in the covenant,</HI> Psal. 103. 17. And also
there are those that break covenant in New Testament-times,
1 <HI>Tim. 5. 12. Having damnation, because they have cast off
their first faith.</HI> The Law was written in mens hearts, and put
into their inward parts in the dayes of the Old Testament,
and some were (as it is called) in an inward Covenant, <HI>Deut.
30. 6. The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart
of thy seed; to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy soule, that thou mayest live,</HI> Psal. 37. 31. <HI>The Law
of his God is in his heart, none of his steps shall slide,</HI> Psal. 119. 11.
<HI>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sinne against
thee. Encline your eare, and come unto me, hear, and your soule
shall live, and I will make an everlasting Covenant with you,
even the sure mercies of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id,</HI> Isa. 55. 3. And so by consequence
it fairly holds, notwithstanding this Text that there is (as hath
been proved) an outward covenant in the dayes of the Gospel.
The oldnesse to be abolished is only in circumstances, wherewith
one and the same covenant that now is, was then clothed.</P>
<P>3. The covenant then spoken to by <HI>Jeremy</HI> in the place quoted,
is not a covenant properly so called, or at least, as Master
<HI>Baxter</HI> observes, not the whole of the covenant. So there must
be two distinct covenants, one in being when the Prophet
wrote, and another to have its being in the time of which he
prophesied; one covenant made with the Jewes, and another
covenant distinct from it made with Christians, and so of
necessity there must be two distinct Gospels. If that spoken
of by <HI>Jeremy</HI> be a covenant properly so called, holding out
the whole nature of the Gospel-covenant, and that New
distinct from the former, then the old covenant must needs in
the whole nature of it be a distinct covenant likewise. In what
<PB N="262" REF="149"/>
sense <HI>Jeremy</HI> is to be understood according to the genuine mean∣ing
of the Text, I have endeavoured to clear▪ as in my answer,
<HI>page</HI> 105. 106, 107. So also <HI>chap.</HI> 26. of this Treatise, and
whether I have answered the objection, which some divine that
I cannot, without enervating the Argument, for effectual grace
and perseverance in it, I must appeal to the impartial Reader. I
am sure none can build effectual grace, and perseverance on that
Text (making it a distinct Covenant from the first) without the
overthrow of effectual grace and perseverance in Old Testament-times.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Professed believers, are under a Covenant of Grace, and not
a Covenant of Works.</HEAD>
<P>IT necessarily follows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Corollary</NOTE> by way of Corollary, from that which
hath been delivered, that no professed believer, that is a mem∣ber
of the Church visible, is under a Covenant of Works, but <HI>eo
nomine,</HI> that he, professedly, gives his name to Christ, he is un∣der
a Covenant of grace. That a man cannnot be under two
Covenants, respective to the same thing, I suppose, is agreed up∣on,
on all hands. A man that holds by one title, if he accept a
second, makes void the first; whether his former title were better,
or worse; whether it tends to his prejudice, or benefit, thus to
make change of it; As it is with covenants among men, so it is in
the Covenant between God and man. If the New Covenant make
void the Old, where both Old and New are substantially the same;
and the difference only circumstantial, as the Apostle sheweth
that it does <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 13. much more then, in those covenants,
which are essentially differing, as are the Covenant of Works,
and the Covenant of grace. Some, that would limit the Cove∣nant,
only to the regenerate, and men of justifying faith, as to
the just latitude of it, make use of this <HI>Maxime,</HI> that the same
man cannot be under two Covenants; which is, indeed, a right
way of arguing; from principles granted on both parts. Now
<PB N="263" REF="149"/>
they assume, that all unregenerate, and persons not justified, are
under a Covenant of Works. This, they take for granted, when
it rests to be proved; and so conclude that these are under no
Covenant of Grace, but a Covenant of Works. I assume, on
the other hand, that so many of them as are Christians, though,
not <HI>Regenerati,</HI> but, <HI>Regenerandi,</HI> as <HI>Pareus</HI> speaks, are under a Co∣venant
of Grace, and therefore, they are not under a Covenant
of Works. Here to avoid mistakes some things are to be premi∣sed,
1. That many of them have not any explicit knowledge of
either Covenant, either that, under which originally they were,
or that, under which, through grace, they are. They are the peo∣ple
of God (and therefore under a saving Covenant with God
though not emproved for salvation) that perish for lack of know∣ledge,
<HI>Hos.</HI> 4. 6. all that bear the name of believers in primitive
times, were not got up in knowledge to the first principles. 2. As
to their present qualification and condition, they are in no better
an estate, than if the obligation of the Covenant of Works, were
still upon them. A man, dealing falsely in the Covenant of
grace, is in as sad a condition, as he that is under that hopelesse,
and destructive Covenant of Works, yea, his condition admits of
many sad aggravations, in that treachery is above rebellion, and
perfidiousnesse exceeds bare disobedience. They were a people
in Covenant, that God owned as his, to whom he said, <HI>Ezek.
16. 48. As I live, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy sister hath not
done, she, nor her daughters as thou hast done, thou, and thy daughters.</HI>
Blessednesse, is no where in Scripture said to be on the head of all
those that are in covenant, unlesse it be meant comparatively, or
respectively only, but, <HI>on such as keep his covenant, and remember
his commandments to do them,</HI> Psal. 103. 18. And, if all that
were in covenant, did keep covenant, there would not be so much
complaint as there is in Scripture, of breach of covenant, nor could
men be under that charge, that their hearts are not stedfast in co∣venant.
3. They are yet in a more desirable estate, and in fairer
way towards happinesse, than those, that are as the Apostle speaks,
strangers from the covenant of promise, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 12. As the Jewes
were a people nigh to the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 148. 14. So they are,
<HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 13. Salvation is of these, though they be not as yet, by a
thorough work of grace in a saving state. There are of these
that shall be saved, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 47. and so there is not, for ought
<PB N="264" REF="150"/>
that Scripture speaks among those that are without covenant,
such are, in Scripture-language, <HI>without God, without hope, Eph.
2. 12. under the wrath and indignation of God,</HI> Jerem. 10. 25.
Psal. 79. 6. When the Apostle therefore, had spoken much a∣gainst
the Jew outwardly, and the circumcision of the flesh. (that
is, men circumcised in flesh and not in heart) <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. upon the
question put, yet concludes, that these Jewes have; This circumci∣sion
hath much profit, every way much advantage, and the ad∣vantage
is, as he expresses it, especially, the Oracles of God,
which are the covenant-draughts, and if they were utterly out of
covenant, I would desire any to shew, where the advantage lies.
That they are in covenant with God and in a covenant of grace
appears therefore.</P>
<P>1. In that they have the Oracles of God. To them, that is, to
the Jew outwardly, these Oracles were committed, as the Apostle
tells us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 1. They were committed to them as their inhe∣ritance,
<HI>Deut.</HI> 33. 4. They were possest of them, in order to e∣verlasting
life, <HI>John</HI> 5. 39. And these Oracles, being Covenant-tables,
Covenant-draughts, the professed believer, that by fa∣vour
from God, stands possest of them, is in Covenant with
God.</P>
<P>2. They have the seals of the covenant. Covenant, and right
to the seale, where seals are appointed, cannot be severed as
shall be shewen. They are in covenant, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was, and,
they have the seales of the covenant, as <HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed
had, Those were circumcised, and these are baptised; and, that
it may appear, that they had not this honour barely from man,
without approbation from God (as some seem to hint, in their di∣stinction
of <HI>Forum Dei,</HI> and <HI>Forum Ecclesiae,</HI> as though the
Church received them, when in the sight of God they had no
right to be received) we finde, 1. That the Spirit of God, in the
Scripture, still calls them, in way of honour, by the name of
circumcision, and men may, but God will not thus give, an equi∣vocal
or nick-name to them. As they were circumcised in the
flesh, so it was the minde of God, that they should beare in their
flesh, this signe and seale of the Covenant. 2. Upon it, they had
many and great priviledges, yea, all Church priviledges, follow∣ed
upon this leading priviledge, though otherwise, strangers to the
Common-weale of <HI>Israel,</HI> now they were look't upon as of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>

they do actually engage, the whole blessing of the Covenant is
theirs. They that undertake the termes, on which covenant-sal∣vation
according to the Gospel is had, are actually vested in a
a saving covenant; but they undertake the termes, on which
covenant-salvation according to the Gospel is had, they are there∣fore
in a saving covenant.</P>
<P>4. In case unbelief and impenitence in them, be not only Law-transgressions,
but also Gospel-sins, and breaches of a Gospel-covenant,
then these professed believers are under a Gospel-cove∣nant.
This is evident; They sin not against the Gospel that are
not under the Gospel, they break not covenant that were never in
covenant, but their unbelief and impenitence are above Law-transgressions,
they are Gospel-sins, and breaches of covenant, as
I think, need not to be proved, and therefore it is plain that they
are in covenant.</P>
<P>Upon this account, I confesse, I have often marvelled why ma∣ny
eminent and godly Divines do earnestly perswade their people
to whom they speak, to enter covenant with God, giving dire∣ctions
what way they are to take to come into covenant with him;
telling them that it is of great concernment to them to know un∣der
what covenant they are, whether under a covenant of Works,
or a covenant of grace; when the same men expressely say that
we all entred covenant in baptisme; and that unbelief and impe∣nitence
at least, if not every sin, is a breach of our baptism, vow
and covenant. Might not any think that these did perswade to be
baptised? and that they tell their people that it is of great con∣cernment,
to know what covenant it is that baptisme seales, whe∣ther
it seales the covenant of Works, or the covenant of Grace.
If we enter in covenant in our baptisme, as they truly say, that
we did, as to the <HI>Jus in re,</HI> then how comes it to passe that any
that are baptised are out of it, and being already actually in it, how
are they perswaded to enter into it. These perswasions therefore,
and motives to enter covenant, I think should be to presse men on
to keep covenant, and so the directions which they lay down are
indeed of divine and excellent use. And when they say it so much
concernes men to know what covenant they are under, I conceive
it should rather be to let them know of how great concernment
it is to them to see that they have their interest in the mercies of
<PB N="266" REF="151"/>
the covenant through grace answering to the termes of it, and re∣quisites
in it, and so the entring of covenant, which is done, as
these say, in baptisme, and keeping of covenaut, or obtaining
the mercies of the covenant, would not be confounded but distin∣guished.
Their labours would likewise be of excellent use which
otherwise scarce suit either with their own words or the Scri∣ptures.
It may be objected, that in case they are from under the
covenant of Works, and under the covenant of Grace, then they
are exempted from the curse, and acquitted from the condemnati∣on
which is annext to that covenant, which cannot be affirmed
of any meer Professour of Christianity in unbelief and impenitence,
and enough is spoken in this Treatise it self against it. To this I
answer, 1. The curse may follow upon the transgression of the
Law, as a Law, without consideration of any covenant at all, whe∣ther
of Works or Grace, and it is not interest in Covenant, but
interest in Christ, (which these, supposedly such, have not) that
frees from condemnation. 2. What if it be yielded that they
beare no more than the penalty annext to the breach of the Co∣venant
of grace. If the Gospel be consulted that is sufficiently
sad and heavy. If they be put to beare that, nothing more needs
to be added to the burden, and indeed with submission to better
judgments, not resolvedly determining any thing, it is my thoughts,
that professed Christians in unbelief and impenitence, suffer not
upon account of the penalty annext to the breach of the cove∣nant
of Works, but upon account of the penalty annext to the
breach of the covenant of Grace; and let not any here object
that the transgression of the Law shall not then be laid to their
charge, for the Gospel bindes us to the obedience of the Law,
though not in exact perfection, yet in sincerity and truth. And
this, I suppose, receives strength from that of the Apostle, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI>
1, 7, 8. The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his
mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Je∣sus
Christ, which character therof [not knowing God] Interpre∣ters
(saith Dr. <HI>Slater</HI> upon the words) generally take to be a descri∣ption
of the Gentiles, who though they know God by his Works,
yet they know him not by his Word, and to this he subscribes.
The other character of [not obeying the Gospel of Jesus Christ]
is, as he saith, a circumscription of Christians, according to In∣terpreters;
<PB N="267" REF="151"/>
Gospel-disobedience is then their guilt, and upon ac∣count
of this they suffer. Had they believed and yielded sincere
obedience which they professed, and to which they engaged them∣selves,
they had not perished, and the want of this appears to be
their destruction.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Interest in a Church-state is of equal latitude with the
Covenant.</HEAD>
<P>THen it follows by way of necessary corollary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Corollary.</NOTE> that Church-membership,
interest in a Church-state, is of equal latitude;
not only the elect and regenerate, but all in covenant (as before
spoken to) have their right, stand entitled to Church-priviledges.
And here lest I should be mistaken, let me explaine my selfe,
that my meaning is not, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> because in covenant with
God, and called by his name, to entitle them to the Church
invisible, and so to suppose them lively members, living in
grace, by influence of the Spirit from Christ; This would clearly
enough contradict, that which before I have spoken, and were
indeed a contradiction in the adject, I mean it of a visible
Church-state, and interest in visible priviledges. If any quar∣rel
at the distinction, as some have done on either hand, en∣deavouring
to take off both members. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI>
not admitting any Church invisible, and others not brooking
any Church, but such as consists of invisible members, as may
appear in their definitions of a particular Church, putting in
those clauses, that belong only to the Church invisible: I shall
refer them to Doctor <HI>John Reynolds,</HI> in his second <HI>Thesis,</HI> ful∣ly
bottoming it on that Text, <HI>Mat. 22. 14. Many are called,
but few chosen,</HI> which yet, must be confest with judicious Master
<HI>Hudson,</HI> that it is not a division into two distinct Churches,
or species of Churches, but a distribution of the subject by the
adjuncts, <HI>viz. à duplici modo communionis, externo, &amp; interno,</HI> Vindi∣cation,
page 4. One, and the same Church, hath members of a
visible, and invisible notion, a more full explanation may there
<PB N="268" REF="152"/>
be seen. This being premised, I affirm, that interest in Church-membership,
in a visible Church-state, is theirs, and may be
claimed by all those that have interest in the covenant before
named, an external interest, or, an interest in the external covenant,
as usually it hath been called This is a sure rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi foedus, ibi ecclesia.</NOTE> <HI>Where the Covenant
is, there the Church is;</HI> and in what latitude soever men are ta∣ken
into covenant, they are received into the Church. Lawes
tendred by a Prince, and received by a people (whether they be
tendred immediately by himself, or by his Heraulds or Embas∣sadours)
make up the relation of King and people: A marriage-covenant
tendred by a man (as by <HI>Abrahams</HI> servant in the
name of <HI>Isaac</HI> to <HI>Rebecca, Gen.</HI> 24.) and accepted by a Virgin,
makes up the relation of husband and wife: covenant-draughts
between man and man for service, (as an apprentice his inden∣tures)
make up the relation of Master and servant, now the
Gospel-covenant is all of these, between God and a people;
where God tenders it, and a people receive it, there God hath
his Spouse, his Subjects, his Servants. These are his people, and
all of these are Church-members. The Word preached and re∣ceived
hath ever been assigned by Orthodox Divines, as the
characteristical note of a Church of God; a Church stands and
falls with it; where it is professedly received, there is a Church-interest.
Let one man apart receive it, as was the case of the
Eunuch, he forthwith becomes a Church-member, and is to
have (as we see he had) his present matriculation, and to be ad∣mitted
by baptism a member (not of this or that Congregation,
but) of the Church universal visible: and upon this account
wheresoever he comes, is a Saint, a Disciple, a Christian, a Be∣leever,
and so to be received and acknowledged; This is
abundantly confirmed in those parables of our Saviour
Christ, <HI>of the floore,</HI> where there is both chaffe and wheat,
<HI>Mat. 3. 12. of the field,</HI> where there is both wheat and tares;
<HI>of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> draught-net,</HI> where are fishes good and bad, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.
24, 47. As also in that of the Apostle, 2 <HI>Tim. 2. 20. In a great
house there are not only vessels of gold, and of silver, but also of
wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</HI> The
Church is this <HI>floore,</HI> this <HI>field,</HI> this <HI>draught-net,</HI> this <HI>great house,</HI> in

<HI>he brings the parable of the floore, in which there is

particular Church, in which (we confesse) there
are bad as well as good, and for the most part
more bad than good.</HI> And though he makes
some exceptions against some of the Para∣bles,
yet he applies the same answer to
others. Concerning that of the draw-net he saith, <HI>The sense of
the parable is manifest</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Sensus parabolae manifestus est sic in Ecclesia evenire solere cùm Evangelium praedicatur, ut cùm verriculum in mare projicitur ad pisces capiendos.

are not separate from the good, till the net be

all men do not come in, all are not good that
come, and the good and bad are not separate
till the end of the world.</HI> And Doctor <HI>Reynolds</HI>

may one be fit to be a member of the universal visible Church, and yet
not qualified to be a member of a particular congregation,</HI> saith Master
<HI>Wood, Append. p.</HI> 169, 170. If I should enlarge this to heathens
brought to a profession of the faith, and argue their right to ba∣ptisme,
upon profession, and by baptisme their right to Church-fellowship
in any visible Church-society. I should finde the Scri∣ptures
abundantly to favour it. Of so many thousands, myriads
of thousands of converts. <HI>Acts</HI> 21. 20. which were added to the
Church, and received by baptisme, (baptized the same day for
a great part, sometimes as appears the very houre of their conver∣sion)
there is not one, that we reade, refused, but all received;
yea, not a scruple raised, save of one only, as I remember, which
was <HI>Saul,</HI> when he offered himself into Church-fellowship, and
that not upon this account that we are now upon, but good <HI>A∣nanias</HI>
fearing that he came, not to joyne with them, but to seise
upon them, knowing that at that time, he had authority from
the chief Priests, to binde all that call on Christs name, <HI>Acts</HI> 9. 14.
If the <HI>competentes,</HI> as they were stiled in the primitive times, (<HI>viz.</HI>
men that offered themselves for Church-fellowship) had then
entred at so strait a door, as now in some places they are put to
passe, where a glib tongue is in a farre fairer way to take, than an
upright heart, we should have heard of no small bustle about it;

saith, The Baptist did not admit all that sought it, unto baptism,

The Baptist reproved them, called them to repentance, and there∣fore
did not baptize them; when the text seems to speak the con∣trary.
For, as soon as his reproof with his exhortation is end∣ed,
there follows, <HI>I indeed baptize you with water, verse</HI> 11.
And it seems by Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> that those Pharisees and Lawyers
that were not baptized of <HI>John,</HI> were not refused, but did refuse,
<HI>Luke 7. 30. But the Lawyers and Pharisees rejected the Councel of
God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</HI> When the same
learned Authour cannot instance any precedent, or produce any
Scripture-Ordinance for it, he endeavours by arguments drawn
from the forme of a particular Church, the way of reformation
of Churches, the relation of inferiority and superiority among
those that are free, and such like reasons to evince it; To which
(but that I will not here make it my businesse) an easie an∣swer
might be given, it is more than strange, that when the
Apostles had by Commission from Christ planted Churches,
and were to leave them to be propagated in future Ages, and
knowing a covenant to be essential to the constitution, as now
by some is asserted; would yet wholly be silent in it, especially
when no such thing was known in Old Testament-Scriptures, that
we might gather it by analogy, and through all Ages, till this
last Age, had lien hid and never discovered, and leave us, by our
reason to discover it, In which we are in danger to set our thresh∣old

<PB N="273" REF="154"/>
speaks nothing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Positions con∣cerning particu∣lar visible Churches, where nothing is want∣ing to the being of a Church, yet much more may be required for the well order∣ing and regula∣ting of it.</NOTE> and Master <HI>John Goodwin</HI> was sometimes as
confident as confidence could make him, that it had no ground
in the holy Scriptures. But to leave heathens, haply called by
Gospel Ordinances, to speak a word or two to our own case,
who are a discipled Nation, a Kingdom subjugated to the yoke of
Christ Jesus, enjoying saving Ordinances, and therefore have a
Church of Christ fixt among us. Here we might lay down divers
positions for the regulating of our judgements.</P>
<P>First, where nothing is wanting to the being of a Church,
God having a people owning him in covenant, yet much more
may be required for the well ordering and regulating of it; where
a people accept of a King, and receive his Lawes, there he hath a
Kingdom, and is a Monarch, yet much more is required for
the ordering of such a Monarchy, for the publick weale and
safety; so it is, where there is a Church of God, accepting
the Lawes of heaven, there the Lord Christ reigns as a Mo∣narch,
yet farther care must be used for the right regulating of
it according to his Will, and the Lawes tendred by him, and
received by them.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A people in a vicinity or neighbourhood ought to associ∣ate according to their best convenience, for participation of Ordinances.</NOTE> a people in a vicinity, or neighbourhood, dwel∣ling
together, ought to associate themselves and joyne with
those of that neighbourhood, according to their best conveni∣ence,
for the participation of Ordinances. As it is against all
dictates of reason, that a people scattered at a great distance
should combine themselves in a Church-way, for Ordinances, in
which God rules, so it is as clear against the Scriptures. You
read of a Church of God, at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> at <HI>Corinth,</HI> at <HI>Philippi,</HI> at
<HI>Thessalonica,</HI> at <HI>Laodicea,</HI> But you reade not of any one Church
made up of members, residing at all those places, or in any places at
like distance. That cohabitation or dwelling together, makes not
up a Church congregational, will be easily granted; Infidels, Turks,
Pagans may cohabit, they may make an idol-church, but not
a Church of God, but co-habitation or dwelling together, is
one ingredient; Saints cohabiting, that is, in New Testament-language,
men separate for God, not Jewes, nor Infidels, but
Christians, and joyning in Ordinances, as in duty they ought, are
a congregational Church. A Pastour ought to watch over his
people, and a people ought to attend to their Pastour, which how
it can be, when the Pastour makes his residence at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> the
<PB N="274" REF="155"/>
people, some at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> some at <HI>Corinth,</HI> some at <HI>Philippi,</HI> and so
scattered, it cannot be imagined. We finde seven several Epistles,
written from heaven to seven several Churches, all which had
their abode at the place, whence the Church bore its name;
these are Scripture-Churches. Now, if any one Church be made
up of Christians, some inhabiting at one of those places, some
at another, a third at a third place, scarce three of one Town,
no more than of one minde; here is not Scripture-order, which
is of God, but an Apocryphal confusion; Exceptions may be ta∣ken
at the over-large extent and disordered situation of divers
Parochial Congregations, which calls for Reformation, coming
too near the inconvenience before mentioned, but Parochial
Assemblies, not the name, but the thing; <HI>viz.</HI> a people inhabit∣ing
at convenient distance, and joyning together under Officers,
according to Scripture, is the way that comes up, both to the
light of reason, and the Presidents of primitive times. Our dis∣senting
Brethren will have the limit of a particular Church, to
be within that number of persons, that may congregate in one
place for Ordinances, if this be yielded (as it must be for Churches
meerly Congregational,) then it will easily be proved, that Pa∣rish-congregations,
that is, congregations of men dwelling in a
vicinity, are of divine institution; Saints that made up a Church
were still Saints in cohabitation, such convenient numbers as
are fit to make up a Church, did not live divided in place, and
scattered, some here, some there, but were, as in faith, so in ha∣bitation
joyned together.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Professing Christians up∣on tender of themselves ought to be e∣steemed mem∣bers in the places where they inhabit.</NOTE> all professing Christians in such cohabitation (especi∣ally
the civil power authorizing) are to be esteemed and judg∣ed
members, and not to be refused, when they offer themselves
as members; where there is a holinesse of separation for God,
and a professed engagement to real holinesse, there is no Scri∣pture-warrant
for repulse; Those that offer themselves to learn,
are taken into the School, and not those only that have made
a good progresse in knowledge, and fit for the uppermost forme.
Me thinks this should be a Proposition agreed upon between us,
and our dissenting brethren, seeing reverend Master <HI>Cotton</HI> lay∣ing
down certain Propositions consented to on both sides, in
his Treatise of the holinesse of Church-members, <HI>page</HI> 1. saith,
<HI>That such, as are borne of Christian Parents, and baptized in their
<PB N="275" REF="155"/>
Infancy into the fellowship of the Church, are initiated members of
the same Church, though des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itute of spiritual grace, until they just∣ly
deprive themselves of the priviledge of that fellowship. For e∣ven
of such is the Kingdome of God,</HI> as <HI>Mar.</HI> 10. 14. This was the
case as we conceive of those that have gone from us into those
parts of <HI>America,</HI> Here they were, in infancy baptized, here they
have joyned in Communion at the Lords Table. If they say,
they were not baptized here into such Church-fellowship, then
they must say that here is no Church of God amongst us (which
as we abhorre to speak, or think of them, so we must not yield con∣cerning
our selves) and farther conclude their baptism here a meer
nullity, and no more than an application of a little common water.
They whose baptisme is valid, are baptized into one body, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>
12. 13. and therefore in a baptized estate, cannot be out of fellow∣ship
with that body. The late Confession of Faith agreed upon by
the Assembly of Divines, not excepted against in that particular
by our brethren that I know, define baptisme to be a <HI>Sacrament of

often marvelled what men mean, when they speak of admissi∣on
of members into Churches, when the parties of whom they
speak have already equal right with themselves to membership,
Have they any other, or better right than title to the covenant, and
admission by the seal of baptism? if they have, let them produce it,
and then submit it to Scripture-trial. I know none other that
will abide the teste; If they confesse baptism to be an admissi∣on,
then their title is as good, that were thus before admitted,
as theirs that give them admission. Their plea in both is one, <HI>viz.</HI>
birth of Christian parents, and baptism. For those that they passe
by, either forbearing to give them admittance desiring, or that
through scruple cannot joyne themselves, not seeing warrant for
such a way, varying from the way of all the Churches of the Saints
heretofore, what do they judge of them? Do they look upon them
as men without, and unworthy of their Communion? Then
<PB N="276" REF="156"/>
they leave them without hope, without God in the world, <HI>Eph.</HI>
2. 12. yea, they put them into an incapacity, according to
Gods ordinary way of salvation. <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 47. All were not
saved, that were added, nor saved in the judgement of charity; that
is a comment, as strange as new, but all were added, and none
refused that would enter themselves into salvation-way, which
they might do out of affection of novelty, at that time possest
with amazement by reason of the miracles, under great present
convictions, through <HI>Peters</HI> powerful Scripture-applications, and
upon twenty other accounts which might be but fits, flashings,
or present workings, yet all that were to be saved were added.
All the maids that were brought to <HI>Ahashuerus</HI> and offered for
purification, <HI>Esther</HI> 2. 3, 4. Were not made Queens, but none
was made Queen that was not thus offered and purified. If it be
said, they are within, as many passages from several hands
would seem to imply, as well concerning such that are refused, as
those that do refuse, the modesty of many is such, that they
are loth to unchurch all but themselves, then they are heires of
the same promise with themselves, and all the essentials of a
Church of God are with those that in this way of Communion
are none of theirs, and consequently their covenant or separate
way, is not of necessity to Church-constitution, whether it be
at all according to Scripture-pattern, rests farther to be enqui∣red
and debated.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation of abuses in Churches is much rather the work of Christians in Churches, than separation from Churches.</NOTE> men by Providence seated among those that are thus
in Covenant by a visible Profession, and joyning in Ordinances,
as before, must, much rather make it their businesse to reform
and redresse abuses, that are found in the respective Societies on
which they are cast, than by any means withdraw and separate
from them. We finde frequent advice in Scripture of <HI>considering
one another, provoking to love and to good works,</HI> Hebrews 10. 24.
<HI>of exhortation one of another,</HI> Heb. 3. 13. <HI>of comforting of themselves

1 Thes. 5. 14. <HI>of converting sinners from the errour of their wayes,

but we reade of an heavy brand laid upon it, <HI>Jude 19. These be
they who separated themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit;</HI> yet,
seeing things may be so carried in societies that be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Name of
Christ, and Christian Professors brought to those straits, that there
is no abiding for such as would keep their garments unspotted, it
will be of use here, to deliver certain rules for our help and
guidance.</P>
<P>1. A Church in covenant with God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Church is pure where the pollutions and taints are not soule.</NOTE> as before, and keeping
up communion in Ordinances, is to be accounted pure,
where the pollutions or taints are not great, nor many, it is
to be accounted a right beleeving Church, notwithstanding
some few lesser Errors. We account a corne-field clean
where some few tares and weeds are found, a body health∣ful
that is not without grudgings, Christ from heaven
gives commendations to those Churches which yet he taxes,
<HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 3. for failings. There is that light in which Errors
may be seen and shunned, and rules for discerning things that
differ. If custom, education, conceit of Teachers, or the
like so dazle the judgement, that the errour is swallow∣ed;
howsoever that be a detriment, a blemish, as the A∣postle
shews of the wood, hay and stubble, built upon the
foundation, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 12. yet it prejudices not salvation.
There is power of truth remaining, to forme and frame
Christ in the heart, to direct the soul in a sanctified way to
salvation.</P>
<P>2. Where the Word is received and profest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foully polluted and defaced, it is a Church, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ains a being though pollu∣ted and erro∣neous.</NOTE> though polluted
and defaced with additions and false glosses, there is a
Church, though polluted and erroneous; Where the essen∣tial
parts of a man are in being, there is a man, though sick
and diseased; where corne is sowen▪ and comes up, there is a
corn-field, though over-run with tares and weeds. The
Churches of <HI>Galatia</HI> have the name of Churches, though
miserably defiled; we deny not the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> the be∣ing
of a Church, having the Scriptures and several funda∣mental
truths from thence, as the Church in Christs time
from the hand of the Scribes and Pharisees, though the
<PB N="278" REF="157"/>
worst deserving the name of a Church of any people with
whom the Word is continued; No Church, some have
avouched, But do her the most right, and the being of a
Church granted, she is a hurch certainly miserably defa∣ced,
monstrously polluted: I will not rake in her sores,
it were easie to name many and loathsome ones. I will only
point at the causes. Where food is scarce, and that pollu∣ted
and unclean, there must needs be bodies diseased, and
distempered; but so it fares with the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> when
the Word should dwell in us in all plenteousnesse, <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 16.
they will have theirs dieted, the Word kept in an unknown
language, as under lock and key, that the children can∣not
come near it. That on which they feed, is not the sin∣cere
milk, which only nourishes to growth, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 2.
But they have their unwritten word, to stand in equipage
with the Scriptures, mens Traditions made doctrines; how
many doctrines do we there finde, by necessary conse∣quence
undermining those fundamental truths that are there
profest? where food is in no more plenty, and no better, it is
no wonder to see diseases follow.</P>
<P>3. That which especially denominates a Church pure or im∣pure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purity or im∣purity in do∣ctrine, espe∣cially gives Churches d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mination.</NOTE>
sound or tainted; is the doctrine which they drink
in, the principles by which they are carried. Where these
are right, this is an high praise; where these are tainted, this
is the greatest blemish. That which advances a Nation a∣bove
all other Nations, so that no Nation is so great as
they, that brings them nigh unto God, is that which is
their greatest honour, and the pollution the greatest ble∣mish,
where all is right in doctrine, it can hardly be con∣ceived,
but that there are at least a few names, that defile not
their garments, though the more the greater glory. This
was the case of <HI>Sardis,</HI> and therefore hath the honour
to be one of the golden Candlesticks where Christ kept re∣sidence.</P>
<P>4. Doctrines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errours in do∣ctrine, are ei∣ther in the foundati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u or superst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uction.</NOTE> which are as the covenant-draughts between God
and a people, have their taints or crazes in the founda∣tion,
or in the superstruction; A breach in the foundation is
the buildings speedy ruine, while that stands, somewhat of
a building remains, when that falls, all falls, and therefore
<PB N="279" REF="157"/>
<HI>Jerusalems</HI> enemies that thirsted after her total ruine, say,
<HI>Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof,</HI> Psal. 137. 7.
These foundation-breaches in buildings may be either cra∣zes
threatning danger, but repairable, taken betimes may
be holpen, though a failing there is soonest helplesse, or
else, it is a ruine or rottennesse that is irremediable, irrepair∣able.
Truths doubted, disputed, questioned, I call a craze
in the foundation wonderfully dangerous, not alwayes
damnable; the case of the <HI>Galatians,</HI> of whom the A∣postle
stood in feare, and was jealous over them, through
a godly jealousie, even of their revolt from Christianity to
Judaism, from Christ to <HI>Moses,</HI> from the Gospel to the
Law: These, he calls Churches, the members brethren,
though in a way to be no Churches, entertaining those do∣ctrines,
that cut off from Christ, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 2. Here,
all those that are builders in Christs work, that are pil∣lars,
or any part of his house, must be zealous, as we see
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> was, in this Epistle quoted; who will see the
foundation of the house where he lives so undermined, as
every day to threaten ruine? much lesse may we suffer the
foundation in Christs house to be thus used. This faith
once delivered to the Saints is the common salvation, for
this we must earnestly contend, <HI>Jude</HI> 3. for this we must
strive together, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 27. Truths denied, abjured, and
resolved against (as it was with <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Philetus,</HI> and
the Apostle saw the Churches in <HI>Galatia</HI> in danger) is a ru∣ine,
and rottennesse, that is irremediable, and irreparable.
Besides breaches in fundamentals, there are breaches in super∣structions,
and these either more neer to the foundation, or
at a greater distance. The nearer the foundation, the more
danger; a breach is more sufferable near the top, than at the
bottome of a tower, or castle. There are errours of more
affinity with those that overthrow bottom-truths, and
there are those that are not so nigh, and therefore not so
dangerous; Such crept into the Latine Church before Anti∣christ
was raised to his height and strength in his delusions,
and Antichrist still holds them of all sorts and sizes; Ei∣ther
of both of these, may<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Negative, or Positive. Nega∣tive,
are such where the doctrine of faith is not laid, Posi∣tive,
<PB N="280" REF="158"/>
where it is mis-laid; where edifying doctrines are
not preached, and where they are mis-preacht, both tend
to the Churches danger; a house never compleat or built
up entire, but defective in several parts, little differs from
that which is ruinous: The Apostle, who is worthily sti∣led
a wise Master-builder, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 10. makes known the
whole counsel of God, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 27. and builds not up de∣fective
Churches.</P>
<P>5. All errors being against Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errours have their estimate accordingly as they rise up a∣gainst Christ and obscure his glory.</NOTE> who is the foundation to
bear up, and carrie on the whole work, accordingly as they
dash upon Christ, and obscure his glory, whether more, or
lesse, the estimate of the danger is to be taken. These are
either such that render Christ in an uncapacity to be our
Mediatour and Saviour, or such that are inconsistent, in
whole or in part with his Mediatourship; of the former
kinde are those that are against his person. 1. Those that
impugne the Godhead of Christ, such, that though they
give him the glory, to be above Angels, yet will make him
no more than a creature; a God in title and place, as are
Magistrates, not in nature or power; An opinion that in∣volves
the Apostolick Church, and all Churches in successi∣on
in idolatry, giving the honour of God, the worship due
to God, unto him who by nature is no God; A doctrine
that will make Christ an impotent, and not an omnipotent
head, too weak for his work, to govern the world, and
bring under his enemies. 2. Those that deny his man∣hood,
as having not taken our flesh, and so, no suitable
head, but a phantastick or seeming body. Those that are
against his Mediatourship; are, either such that obscure,
or some way eclipse it, as every errour doth that is any
way considerable, or such that raze, if not utterly over∣throw
it, in some of the necessary parts of it, his King∣dome,
Priesthood, or Prophetical Office. These are over∣thrown,
either directly, in termes of full opposition, or else
by consequence, and this such, that is either immediate and
evident, the truth being confest, these cannot be denied, or
else the consequence more remote, and not so easily discern∣ed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Separation in some cases ne∣cessary.</NOTE>
These things being premised, we must bring it home to
our purpose. 1. Where fundamental truths are not only
<PB N="281" REF="158"/>
questioned, doubted and disputed, but abjured and deny∣ed,
errours directly or by immedate clear consequence intro∣duced
so, that the truth cannot be known, but the errour
must be seen, and this declared by publick confession, and
generally held, Christians are to be gone, here are not
sufficient edifying truths, nor yet antidotes to preserve
from danger, when they <HI>would have healed Babylon, and she
would not be healed, then it is time to forsake. If any man
come unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not in∣to
your house, neither bid him God speed,</HI> 2 John 10. saith
<HI>John,</HI> much lesse then, may we hold such communion with
them It is said of Mice, that when the house, through ruines
is falling, they will be gone, shall nature teach them to pro∣vide
for their safety, and shall nothing teach Christians
to see to their own salvation? When <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was to be
destroyed according to Christs prediction, and not one
stone to be left upon another; a voice is said to be heard cry∣ing,
Get out to <HI>Pella.</HI> Foundation-breaches seen, and suf∣fered,

are falling▪ There is a flight too soon, when care might
keep up the buildings, when with the poore man we may
save and deliver the City, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 9. 15. They that preach∣ed
Christ in those Churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> and preached
down Circumcision, and other points of Judaisme, pleased
the Apostle better, then they that without such endeavour
should desert it; so those that had preached the resurrecti∣on
in <HI>Corinth,</HI> had better pleased then those that had left the
place for their sakes that denyed it. A Church may not onely
degenerate, but apostatize; may not onely languish, but
lose her vital spirits, may not onely displease her Bride∣groom,
but suffer a divorce; perhaps keep the title of a
wife, and indeed be a strumpet, and want all evidence of re∣lation
to the Bridegroome. 2. In the case of pollutions of
a more inferior alloy, a Christian may be necessitated to
leave. 1. When the food of life, knowledge in the word
or means to compasse it, cannot be had. In such a case it must
be sought, They must resolve with the Lepers, 2 <HI>King. 7. 3.
not to sit still and die.</HI> When the <HI>Priests and Levites left

people, men of self-consecration, set up in their stead af∣ter
them out of <HI>all the tribes of Israel, such as set their
hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to

<HI>without a teaching Priest,</HI> they were (as the Prophet tells
<HI>Asa,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 3.) <HI>without the Law, and without God,</HI> and
there was no staying there. 2. When a man by compulsion
is necessitated to give approbation to such pollutions, in
any such way that speaks his compliance, whether it be
by the civil power, through unsufferable fines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulcts, im∣prisonments
unavoidable, or peril of life, Or by the Eccle∣siastical
power in excommunications, when men are dri∣ven
out, or necessitated for soul-subsistence to go out,
there is full liberty and warranty to leave, But when Or∣dinances
in a saving way, may be enjoyed, with liberty and
safety, no Laws being enacted for their so heavy persecuti∣on,
or through indulgence or connivence not put into ex∣ecution,
there the Churches good calls for good mens stay,
not their secession or separation There was not a little
leaven in the Churches doctrine, in Christs time, errour was
advanced into <HI>Moses</HI> chaire, yet Christ himself, with many o∣ther
that waited for redemption in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> held com∣munion
as Church-members. All was not right in every
Church of the Saints to whom Christ wrote, <HI>Revel.</HI> 2. 3.
and to whom <HI>Paul</HI> sent Epistles, yet as they retained still
the honour of Churches, and the happinesse of Christs
presence, so we hear nothing of separation enj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned, or
practised. The condition of Beleevers in the Synagogue of
<HI>Rome</HI> was otherwise, The key of knowledge is there taken
away, the people not allowed to read it, in private, or to
heare it in publick, but kept reserved in an unknown lan∣guage,
neither could they without capital danger keep
themselves from compliances in their sinne, so that reformed
Churches did not in any unwarrantable way of Schisme
leave, but rather were left, They forsook not the Church,
but the botches and corruptions in it, though we were
never forbidden to partake of their truths, yet we are for∣bidden
to <HI>partake of their sins, lest we partake of their plagues,

truths could not be enjoyed, but their guilt through sinne

these Heterogeneal things, and not theirs that do refuse
them.</P>
<P>6. Corruptions in conversation scarce admit of separation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corruption in conversation hardly admit of separation.</NOTE>
provided that doctrine be such, in which men may have com∣munion

through the revolution of all times, after they were a vi∣sible
body come out from <HI>Abrahams</HI> loines, we may finde

which they enjoyed by their call into Church-fellowship,
<HI>children of God, holy people, Gods peculiar ones,

righteous persons, kept their residence among them, held
communion with them, and saw no ground of separation
from them, the words of eternal life being with them,
as Christ testifies in his speech to the <HI>Samaritan</HI> woman,
<HI>John</HI> 4. 22. when in the meane time their qualifications
were as low, as their titles high, their conversation no
way answering their calling, but branded to be <HI>stiffe∣necked,
of an iron sinew, adulterous, a sinful Nation, a
people foolish and unwise, as</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>to the
Lord,</HI> Deut 9. 6. Isa. 48. 4. Ezek. 16 32. Isa. 1. 4. Deut. 32. 6.
Isa. 1. 10. It is a great contradiction with some men, to
name men at all Saints, beleevers, professours, when their
lives evidence an unsuitablenesse to such a glory, yet we
know the Churches to whom Epistles are directed in Scri∣ptures,
are so honoured as we may see in their frontispieces,
and among them the choicest, and most upright-hearted,
had converse and communion, when yet they did wrong,
defraud, contended aud disputed for Idol pollutions and

on 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 2. puts a question how <HI>Paul</HI> could give the
name of a Church to them. If we would know what the
Prophets and Apostles held concerning lawfulnesse of com∣munion
in such Churches, we may enquire what was their
practice, They did not leave them, but made it their busi∣nesse,
by all ways in their power to reclaim them, to work
a change and conversion among them. The advice that was
sometimes given to a maid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aut de fatuis virgiuibus es aut de or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den∣tibus si de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣tuis Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>regatio tibi necessaria est, si de prudentibus tu congregationi <HI>Corruption in discipline hardly admits of separation.</HI></NOTE> that for religions sake would re∣tire

to these persons, either they stand in need of the Church, or
the necessities of the Church call for their help and assist∣ance.</P>
<P>7. The same that I have said of corruption in conversation, I
may affirme of neglects in discipline. Reverend Master
<HI>Cotton</HI> judges, that <HI>the many notorious scandalous Persons, that
were found in the Church of</HI> Israel, <HI>did argue the neg∣lect
of Church-discipline, in the toleration of such publick scan∣dals
in the Church.</HI> Holinesse of Church-members, <HI>pag.</HI> 21.
And yet none of the Prophets or men of God, who could
not be ignorant of the Churches duty, and their sinne in
such neglects, ever made attempt of setting up purer se∣lect
Churches nor made separation from that which was
in this sort (as is said) faulty. All was not right in exercise of
discipline, in the Churches planted by the Apostles some
are censured as foully faulty. The Church of <HI>Corinth, 1 Cor.</HI>

garments, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 4. and yet nothing is heard by way of
advise for any to make separation, nor reproof for their
holding up communion▪ nor any one instance of a separa∣tist
given. Those that for many years together, during the
Reigne of the three last Princes, denyed to come up to a
full conformity to this Church, had a low opinion of the dis∣cipline
<PB N="285" REF="160"/>
then exercised, of which they have left behinde
them large evidences, yet how tender were they of the
Churches honour to keep Christians in Communion?
How zealous were they against separation? As may ap∣peare
in the labours of Master <HI>Parker,</HI> though distasted
by him that prefaced before his work of Ecclesiastical Po∣licy,
Master <HI>Paget,</HI> Master <HI>Ball,</HI> Master <HI>Brightman</HI> laid us
low enough, when he did not onely parallel us with luke∣warme
<HI>Laodicea,</HI> but made that Church the type, and us
the antitype, Our state, as we stood at that time by reason
of our discipline, (according to him) being rather aimed at
by Jesus Christ in his Epistle, then the <HI>Laodicean</HI> State in <HI>A∣sia,</HI>
then existent; yet how zealous is he against separation
from these Assemblies? Having largely set out a double and
singular honour in that Church, (as he stiles it) <HI>viz Christs

Master <HI>Cotton</HI> in his preface to Master <HI>Hildersams</HI> work
upon the fourth of <HI>John</HI> (whom without honour I cannot
mention) set forth his renoune for this work of opposing
separation? of which he still appeares to be tender though
he seeme <HI>page</HI> 13. of his Treatise of holinesse of Church-members
to be over indulgent to it, Speaking in excuse of
those that withdraw from communion in publick Ordi∣nances
of Christ, when Church-Officers receive in, for mem∣bers
of the Church, those that are most scandalous and wic∣ked,
and not such Saints as <HI>Paul</HI> writeth to at <HI>Rome,
Corinth, Ephesus, Colosse,</HI> and defending them against Mr.
<HI>Rutherford,</HI> he saith, <HI>But if private members be perswaded
in conscience from the word of God, that themselves have due
right and interest as well in the admission of members as in
excommunication of offenders or in election of officers, how shall
they keep themselves from partaking in the sinnes of their Of∣ficers,
if they suffer them to go on in such a manifest breach
of rule without due proceeding against them for their refor∣mation?</HI>
and after some caution given he concludes, <HI>It is
essential to Community to have power to admit unto commu∣nion,
and to withdraw from communion.</HI> To which I say. 1.
We have not a full account, of the Saints in those Churches,
respective to scandals, it seems by divers passages, that
many in <HI>Colosse,</HI> were none of the soundest in faith, as ap∣pears
by the Apostles reproof, <HI>chap.</HI> 2 20. I am sure, that if any
Church, have such as were to be found in <HI>Corinth,</HI> for igno∣rance,
Idolatry, faction, oppression, adultery, lasciviousness,
prophanation of the Lords Table, they will be judged suffici∣ently
scandalous. 2. If such a perswasion in conscience, would
warrant a separation, it would be worth enquiry to know
what separation is not warrantable? The error that Mr.
<HI>Brightman</HI> brands, as wicked and blasphemous, is here abun∣dantly
justified; Church-guides (at least in some places) were
then, so far at least, guilty in their admissions. 3. What war∣ranty
is there, for any mans withdrawing himself, from
publick Communion in the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, when
he may with freedome enjoy that glorious priviledge, up∣on
<PB N="287" REF="161"/>
that account that he cannot enjoy the whole of
those priviledges, or actual exercise of them, in which
he takes himself to have any interest. Sure I am Ministers
of Christ, in many reformed Churches in the world,
have judged themselves to be overmuch coopt up, in
several particulars, when yet they judged the very thought
of separation in this case, to be the greatest <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aculum.</HI>
4 This right or interest in every particular member to
vote in this way for admission or ejection, may well be
questioned; If there had been this freedome in primitive
times claimed, and exercise, there had not been so much,
in so short a space dispatched, as was done in <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
and <HI>Samaria, Acts 2. Acts</HI> 8. If all must vote, in businesse
of so high concernment, as in proceeding against officers,
and to give definitive sentence concerning their proceed∣ings,
either many a meet member will be kept without,
or else many an incompetent judge, must be taken in, ma∣ny
a poor soul weak in the faith is fit for the Lords Table,
who is not yet fit to judge of the abilities of his Pastour.
All, that I know, that is produced with any colour, is that
direction of <HI>Paul</HI> to the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5.
<HI>When ye are gathered together with the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of
the flesh, that the Spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus.</HI> But if it be considered, that <HI>Corinth</HI> had more then
one Congregation (as several <HI>Dissenting brethren</HI> have
yeelded, and as to other Churches may easily be proved)
then, it must follow, that this meeting was only of officers,
and not of all Members. And how this power is essential
to a community, I cannot conceive. The <HI>English</HI> Nation
have judged themselves a community, and yet there is ma∣ny
a free-borne Subject, that never had a thought of inter∣essing
himself by way of vote; to naturalize strangers, or to
make them free Denizons, nor yet to expulse them in case
of intrusion. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orporations of <HI>England</HI> are commu∣nities,
yet every Member hath not his interest, for vote to re∣ceive
into their body. When the chief Captaine bought his
Freedome in <HI>Rome,</HI> Acts 22 28 I scarce think, every Free∣man
of that society was consulted in it, neither did <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="162"/>
when he heard of it, enter his exception, because his interest
was infringed. The several companies in <HI>London,</HI> are so
many several communities; yet every one of the members
of those Companies, doth not claime an interest, in recei∣ving
in, men, as free of their respective mysteries; an opinion
of such a Liberty, will soon bring Church Members under
an heavy yoke, taking themselves to be so farre interessed
in every publick act of their Officers, that they may not
without open opposition (which is seldome borne) or
actual separation, keep themselves from guilt in their aber∣rations.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To gather Churches out of Churches to make up one Congregation out of many is unwarrantable.</NOTE> to gather Churches out of Churches; to make up one
congregation of Members appertaining to, and locally seated in
many, is most anti-Scriptural. It were easie to bring abundant
arguments against this practice. The disorderly confusion, which
of necessity it doth occasion; The weakening of the work of
God in the place where providence hath seated them, and con∣ferred
many mercies upon them: The robbing of Pastours of
their flock, spiritual Parents of their children, who, they confesse
are of use to fit men, for such a new congregated way, that is, to
beget them by the Gospel to Christ Jesus; but unfit to instruct or
build them: The animosity of Spirit that is wrought in these
separating ones, judging them whom they leave as no Ministers
of Christ, nor their congregations any Churches of Christ with∣drawing
from thence, where Christ is pleased to keep residence.
But letting these passe, I shall onely urge this, that it is without all
Scripture-president, or example, to gather up one Church (as
these pretend) out of the cream and quintescence of many Church∣es.
There was much amisse, in several of the Churches, of <HI>Asia;
Philadelphia</HI> it appears was the soundest, yet Saints they left not,
but held communion with the several Churches, where by pro∣vidence
they were placed, and did not pick up one out of all, as a
Church in eminence of purity and glory; neither there or elsewhere
hath there been found any such practice.<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> I know but one instance
of this kinde, that is pretended, that is <HI>John Baptist,</HI> who while the
Church of the Jews stood a Church of God, gathered a Church
out of them, as is objected, and did embody them. To this I might
have much to answer.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John Baptist</HI> set up no new Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> distinct from the Church
<PB N="289" REF="162"/>
of the Jewes; Christ and his Apostles submitting to that which
<HI>John</HI> did introduce, yet still held communion with the Church of
the Jews; They were not Members at once of two distinct
Churches; of the new, because more refined, and of the old
tainted and corrupted.</P>
<P>2. If <HI>John Baptist</HI> according to duty, set up a new gathered
Church in a Church of Christ; then all the Prophets from <HI>Samuel</HI>
to <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> fell short of duty. If they follow <HI>John</HI> in
what he did, we follow all the Prophets and Apostles in what
they did, All the Prophets till <HI>John,</HI> did prophesie in the same
Church of Christ and not any of them did set up new
Churches.</P>
<P>3. The old Church-way of administration among the Jewes
was then to fall, that present administration to be taken down
by Gods appointment, and a new one to be set up according to his
prescript.</P>
<P>4. <HI>John</HI> set up a new Sacrament, in a new way which after his days
was the alone Church-way. If any can shew (as our seekers look
after) that Jesus Christ, shall now put an end to this way, and that,
they have a Commission, for a new Sacrament of initiation,
then they speak somewhat, for setting up new Churches, in like
manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A dogmatical Faith entitles to Baptisme.</HEAD>
<P>3. IT farther follows by way of consectary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Corollary.</NOTE> that a dogmati∣call
Faith (ordinarily called by the name of Faith histo∣rical,
such that assents to Gospel-truths, though not affecting
the heart to a full choice of Christ, and therefore was short of
Faith which is justifying and saving) gives title to baptisme.
The Covenant is the ground on which baptisme is bottomed,
otherwise Church-Membership would evince no title either in
Infants, or in men of years to Baptisme; But the Covenant (as we
have proved) is entred with men of Faith; not saving, and there∣fore
to them Baptisme is to be administred. How the consequent
<PB N="290" REF="163"/>
can be denyed by those that grant the Antecedent; Baptisme de∣nied
in <HI>foro Dei,</HI> to men short of saving faith, when they are in
covenant, I cannot imagine; yet some that have confessed their
interest in the covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments evincing the title of men professing faith to Baptisme.</NOTE> now deny their title to Baptisme; and
affirme, <HI>If men be once taught that it is a faith, that is short of justi∣fying
and saving Faith, which admitteth men to Baptisme; it will
make foule work in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) All that hath been said for the latitude of the covenant,
may fitly be applyed in opposition to this tenent, for the like la∣titude
of Baptisme.</P>
<P>(2) All the absurdities following the restraint of the cove∣nant
to the Elect, to men of Faith saving and justifying, follow
upon this restraint of interest in Baptisme.</P>
<P>(3.) To make the visible seale of Baptisme which is the privi∣ledge
of the Church visible, to be of equal latitude with the seale
of the Spirit which is peculiar to invisible members, is a Para∣dox.</P>
<P>4. The great condition to which Baptisme engages, is not a
prerequisite in baptisme. This is plaine, to man is bound to make
good his covenant conditions before his engagements to conditi∣ons;
no servant is tyed to do his work, to gaine admission into
service; no souldier to fight in order to get himself listed under
command. But Faith, that is justifying, is the condition to which
baptisme engages, and no condition necessarily required to vest
him in it.</P>
<P>5. That Faith upon which <HI>Simon Magus</HI> in Primitive times
was baptized, is that which admitteth to baptisme; <HI>Simon</HI> him∣self
beleeved, and was baptized, <HI>Act.</HI> 8. 13. But <HI>Simons</HI> faith
fell short of saving and justifying.</P>
<P>(6.) In case only justifying faith give admission to baptisme,
then none is able to baptize; seeing this by none is discerned;
and to leave it to our charity, affirming that we may admit upon
presumption of a title when God denies, I have spoken some∣what,
<HI>chap.</HI> 38. and I refer to Master <HI>Hudson</HI> in his <HI>Vindication,</HI>
whom learned Master <HI>Baxter</HI> so highly commends to shew the un∣reasonablenesse
of it. Here it is objected.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Objections answered."/> When Christ saith, make me Disciples of all Nations, bapti∣zing
them; he means sincere Disciples, though we cannot ever know
them to be sincere.<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/></P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="163"/>
<HI>I answer.</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> <HI>In case I make this first objection brought against
me, my seventh and last argument for me; it will fully discover
the weaknesse of it, and thus I forme it. All that are Disciples
unto Christ, and made disciples for Christ, are to be baptized;
but some are made Disciples to Christ, that are short of faith
saving and justifying, as hath been proved at large. This Disciple∣ship
that Christ there mentions, is such, of which whole Nations
are in capacity, as is plaine in the Commission, to which this
Nation (with others) hath happily attained according to the
manifold prophecies before cited; of these the whole universal
visible Church consists as is irrefragably proved by Mr.</HI> Hudson <HI>in
his Treatise of that subject, and his</HI> Vindication; <HI>and most amply
spoken to by Mr.</HI> Baxter <HI>in his plaine Scripture-proof of Infants
Church-membership and baptisme,</HI> page 279, 280. Sir, if you
were my father, I would tell you that when you say [Christ makes
no one City, Countrey, Tribe his Disciples] you speak most malig∣nantly
and wickedly against the Kingdome and dignity of my Lord
Jesus. Hath he not commanded to disciple Nations? Hath not
the Father promised to give him the Heathen or Nations for his
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession?
<HI>Psalme</HI> 2. And that Nations shall serve him? And that the
Kingdomes of the world shall be become the Kingdomes of the Lord
and his Christ? and do you not see it fulfilled before your eyes?
Are not Bew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, Keder Minsters, &amp;c. and England (till of late)
as full Christs disciples, and so Church-members, as the Jewes
were in covenant with God, and so Church-members? We are not
all sincere: True no more were they for with many of
them God was not well pleased, but shut out all that Nation
of covenanters from his rest, save <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Joshuah.</HI> We may
have Pagans and infidels lurk amongst us unknown; but they had
many amongst them known. In the mean time we as generally
professe Christianity, as they did to serve the true God. And are
you sure there is never a City or Town that are all sincere? I think
you be not; or at least is there never a godly family as Abrahams
was? you cannot be ignorant that the terme [Disciples] in Scri∣pture
is given to more to the sincerely-godly. <HI>And if whole Na∣tions;
yea, the whole Universal visible Church (consisting of
discipled Nations) were all beleevers, it were a happinesse,
then election would be as large as Vocation; when Christ saith,</HI>
many are called, but few chosen.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="164"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> When he saith he that beleeveth and is baptized shall be
saved; here faith goes before baptism, and that not a common, but a sa∣ving
faith: for here is but one faith spoken of, and that is before baptism.</P>
<P>1. This is the weakest of all arguments, to reason for a pre∣cedency
of one before another,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> from the order in which they are
placed in Scripture. So we may say, <HI>John</HI> baptized before he preach∣ed
the baptisme of Repentance; for his baptizing is put before
his preaching of baptisme, <HI>Mark</HI> 1. 4. and that those that he
baptized did confesse their sinnes after their baptisme, seeing it is
mentioned after that it is said, that they were baptized, <HI>Mat.</HI>
3. 6. and both of these with a farre greater probability of reason,
seeing in both there is a narrative of the thing by the Evangelists,
and in the place in hand there is neither commission given for the
work of baptizing, nor yet any narrative of the work,
but onely doctrine given in charge which they were to de∣liver,
which least of all speaks the order in which the duties spe∣cified
must necessarily be practised. All that can be collected,
is that we must in Gods ordinary way of conferring salvation,
have both Faith and baptisme; though there be not the like ab∣solute
necessity of baptisme as of Faith; baptisme being necessary,
<HI>necessitate precepti;</HI> Jesus Christ having instituted it, and com∣manded
it; but Faith is necessary both <HI>necessitate medii,</HI> and <HI>prae∣cepti;</HI>
seeing Christ not only commanded it, but salvation at no
hand can be obtained (by men in capacity of it) without it; And
therefore it hath been well observed that in the words following,
the like stresse is not laid on Baptisme as on Faith; not he that is
not baptized, <HI>but he that beleeveth not, shall be damned.</HI></P>
<P>2. Let <HI>Peter</HI> where he speaks of salvation by baptisme, inter∣pret
these words; <HI>Baptisme doth now also</HI> (saith he) <HI>save us by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 21. and then explaines
himselfe; <HI>Not the pntting away the filth of the flesh, but the an∣swer
of a good conscience towards God.</HI> This answer or restipula∣tion,
unto the outward administration of baptisme, is that which
follows upon baptisme; but justifying Faith is that restipulati∣on
(at least a principal branch of it), and therefore there is no
necessity that it go before, but a necessity that it must follow
after baptisme. It is true that in men of yeares, justifying faith
sometimes goes before baptisme, as in <HI>Abraham</HI> it went before
Circumcision, but it is not of necessity required to interest us in a
<PB N="293" REF="164"/>
right, neither of baptisme, nor circumcision.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> That faith to which the promise of Remission and Justi∣cation
is made, it must also be sealed to (or that faith which is the
condition of the Promise, is the condition in <HI>foro Dei</HI> of the title to the
seal;) But it is onely solid true faith, which is the condition of the
promise (of Remission; Therefore it is that onely that gives right in
<HI>foro Dei</HI> to the seal.</P>
<P>Here is an Argument first proposed,<MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> secondly in a <HI>parenthesis</HI>
paraphrased, for the proposition I say faith is not sealed to, but
remission of sinnes or salvation upon condition of faith. A profes∣sour
of Faith that goes no farther, may engage himself to a lively
working faith, and upon those termes God engages for, and
puts his seale for Remission and Salvation. For the parenthesis,
<HI>That faith which is the condition of the Promise, is the condition</HI> in
foro Dei <HI>of the title to the seale,</HI> I judge the contrary to be unde∣niable.
That faith which is the condition of the Promise, is not
the condition <HI>in foro Dei</HI> of title to the seale. An acknowledge∣ment
of the necessity of such faith with engagement to it, is
sufficient for a title to the seale, and the performance of the con∣dition
of like necessity to attaine the thing sealed. To promise
service and fidelity in war is enough to get listed, as to do service is
of necessity to be rewarded.</P>
<P>Fourthly, as for the Argument <HI>ad hominem</HI> framed against
those who make initial or common faith sufficient to entitle to Ba∣ptisme,
and yet affixe remission of sins to all Baptisme, even so
received without any performance of farther engagement; I leave
to them to defend who maintaine such doctrine, and to speak to
the absurdities that follow upon it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, that of <HI>Philip</HI> to the Eunuch seems to carry most colour.
<HI>The Eunuch must beleeve with all his heart before he be baptized,</HI>
and I have known it troublesome that are fully convinced that a
dogmatical faith gives title to Baptisme, satisfying themselves with
this answer, That howsoever <HI>Philip</HI> called for such a faith which
leads to salvation, yet did not expresse himself so far that no Faith
short of this gives title to baptisme.</P>
<P>It may be answered that a dogmatical faith is true faith, <HI>suo
genere,</HI> as well as that which justifies; therefore I know not why
men should give it the terme of false faith, seeing Scripture calls
it faith, and such as those beleevers, and the heart in such a
<PB N="294" REF="165"/>
Faith (as to an entire assent) is required. If we look into the
Eunuchs answer on which <HI>Philip</HI> did rest satisfied, and proceeded
upon it to baptisme, it will take away all scruple; his answer is,
<HI>I beleeve that Jesus Christ is the Sonne of God.</HI> There is no more in
that then a common faith, this is beleeved by men not justified;
yet this faith entitles to baptisme, and upon this confession of
faith, the Eunuch is baptized.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Impenitence and unbelief in professed Christians, is
breach of Covenant.</HEAD>
<P>4. IT yet follows by way of consectary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Corolary.</NOTE> that men in impeni∣tence
and unbelief, that lie in sin, and live in neglect of the
sacrifice of the blood of Christ, live in a continual breach of co∣venant.
They engage by covenant to believe in Christ, and forsake
their sin; when yet they lie in unbelief &amp; impenitence, are convinced
that they are Fornicators, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, abusers
of themselves with mankinde, thieves, covetous, drunkards, re∣vellers,
and extortioners, These do not only transgresse the Law
(which on the severest penalty forbids these wayes) but break
covenant with God, and so are shut out of the Kingdome of
Heaven; the reward upon covenant, to those whose hearts are
upright. For howsoever, I fully assent to learned Master <HI>Baxter,</HI>
that all weaknesses are not covenant-breaches, and therefore
with him, judge it to be their mistake, who in their confessions ac∣knowledge
that we break covenant all that we do; yet those
men in the list mentioned, having given their names to God,
and entred covenant with him, walking in these forbidden
wayes, are found covenant-breakers; and therefore the <HI>Psal∣mist</HI>
deservedly sayes to them, <HI>Psalme 50 16, 17. What hast
thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my Co∣venant
in thy mouth; seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my

vertue of Gods grant in covenant, as appeares in the con∣text▪
Engaging to him, and thus flying off from him, they desert
<PB N="295" REF="165"/>
the mercies which they might receive from him. As a wife by a∣dultery,
so they by sin forsake the covenant by which they stand
betrothed, and by consequence it must needs follow, that Christ
died for breach of the covenant of Grace, as well as for breach
of the covenant of Works; unlesse we will say that all men by
name Christian, and found in any of these sinnes, are in a lost
and unrecoverable condition; joyning with them that have said,
that there is no grace or pardon for those that fall into sinne
after baptisme. That he died not for their sinnes that live and
die in final impenitence and unbelief, may be easily granted,
and that rises to no more then that he died not for those, that
finally and unrecoverably break covenant with him. It is
granted by a learned adversary that final unbelief and impeni∣tence,
are violations of this covenant, but no other impenitence
or unbelief; but that which is final, and for this, as is affirmed
Christ never died; To this I say, If unbelief and impenitence be
not breaches or violations of covenant properly so called, then
final unbelief and impenitence is no breach or violation of cove∣nant
properly so called. This is clear, Final perseverance in un∣belief
and impenitence is no more, then a continuance of the
same posture or state of Soul God ward, in which they before
stood, in impenitence or unbelief; As Perseverance in faith and
repentance, is the continuance of faith and repentance. If then
final unbelief and impenitence be a breach of the covenant of
grace, then all unbelief and impenitence, denominating a man,
an unbeleeving and impenitent person, is a breach of covenant
likewise.</P>

some have so mudded the way, that it is not easie to proceed in

the New Covenant) their opinion is fully and clearly enough held
out. All beleevers according to them are in covenant, and
onely those that actually beleeve; They entitle themselves, but
cannot interest their seed in any title to it. But as to the first
Covenant some make it to consist meerly of carnal promises, and
Circumcision they answerably make a carnal badge, and so their

second. The seed is included in the first carnal covenant, but ex∣cluded

<HI>Esau;</HI> not by a Church-censure, as Master <HI>Cotton</HI> affirmes, <HI>Holi∣nesse
of Church-Members,</HI> Church-censures, fall not so heavy as to
reach all posterity; but by divine prerogative as the Apostle,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 9. abundantly declares. His casting out sufficiently argues
that he was once in, and when he received the token of the co∣venant,
he was in covenant.</P>
<P>(2.) He does ill, in laying upon <HI>Ishmael</HI> the brand of ba∣stardy,
as though he were a sonne of whoredomes to faithful
<HI>Abraham;</HI> Concubines in Scripture have the name of wives, and
their seed was ever accounted legitimate; neither will this serve
his purpose at all to argue <HI>Ishmael</HI> out of Covenant. It was the
case of <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Nepthali, Gad</HI> and <HI>Asher,</HI> (out of whose loines
a considerable part of Gods Covenant-people did issue) as well
as <HI>Ishmaels.</HI> And could he fasten that ignominy on <HI>Abraham,</HI>
and <HI>Ishmael,</HI> to make it an illegitimate issue; yet this would not
cast <HI>Ishmael</HI> out of covenant. It was the case of <HI>Pharez, Zarah,
Jephthah,</HI> and yet they were all in Covenant with God. 2. He
makes applicat on of this distinction, and saith, <HI>Of the three former
kinds of</HI> Abrahams seed <HI>the promise recited is meant, but in a different
manner thus: That God promiseth he will be a God to Christ, im∣parting
in him blessings to all the Nations of the earth, to the spiritu∣al
seed of</HI> Abraham <HI>in Evangelical benefits to the natural seed in∣heriting
in domestick and political benefits.</HI> So that it evidently
appeares, that he casts out all the natural seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> (legi∣timate
or base, as he calls them, inheriting or not inheriting) from
any title to that Covenant, save in domestick and political be∣nefits.
Here I shall undertake a Position in full opposition, that
<HI>that Covenant in those words exprest; I will establish my Cove∣nant
between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generati∣ons
<PB N="298" REF="167"/>
for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee and to they seed
after thee,</HI> Gen. 17. 7. <HI>in their fullest latitude, as they are there
spoken, in the largest comprehension (which according to Scripture they
can be taken) are entred with all the natural seed of</HI> Abraham, <HI>by</HI>
Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob. But before I come to the confirmation of it
(which is a matter of ease, if any) give me leave, (as well for
the help of the Reader, as satisfaction of the Adversary,) to pre∣mise
some things to avoid all misunderstandings being necessitated
to it by the foul miscarriage of some in their stating of this
question.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Positions pre∣mised for a right under∣standing of the question.</NOTE> we take not in all the natural seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as the
Position plainly expresseth, but the seed by promise which I un∣derstand
not of the Elect, or Regenerate seed; but of that seed
which God by miracle (according to promise) gave to <HI>Abraham</HI>
by <HI>Sarah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All the natural seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> is not in Covenant, but onely the seed by promise.</NOTE> when she was past years of child-bearing. The natu∣ral
posterity (which was the birth by Promise) we only under∣stand;
And so the Apostle explaines it, <HI>Rom. 9. 7, 8. Neither
because they are the seed of</HI> Abraham, <HI>are they all children; but
in</HI> Isaac <HI>shall thy seed be called. That is, they which are the children
of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the
Promise are counted for the seed:</HI> Where [children of God] is
taken in the same latitude as [Adoption] <HI>ver.</HI> 4 comprizing all
the visible body of the Jewes, as it is also taken, <HI>Deut.</HI> 14. 1.
Only those that are borne by Promise are included, and all
the sonnes of <HI>Ishmael</HI> and <HI>Keturah,</HI> (though their parents were
once in Covenant) are by Gods special command shut out▪
Neither are all these included; for as God cast off <HI>Ishmael</HI> and
his seed, so he also cast out <HI>Esau,</HI> and his posterity, Therfore the A∣postle
having brought the former distinction of seeds, rests not
there, but addes, <HI>verse 10, 11, 12, 13. And not only this, but when</HI>
Rebecca <HI>also had conceived by one, even by our Father</HI> Isaac; <HI>for
the children being not yet borne, neither having done any good or evil,
that the purpose of God according to Election might stand; not of works,
but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, the elder shall serve
the younger, as it is written;</HI> Jacob <HI>have I loved, but</HI> Esau <HI>have I
hated.</HI> And therefore the denomination of the seed, is, in <HI>Jacob,</HI>
sirnamed <HI>Israel;</HI> Therefore when the head, or if you will, the root
of the covenant, is mentioned in Scripture, it is not barely <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI>
but <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> to exclude all <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed of any
<PB N="299" REF="167"/>
other line; not barely <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> but <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI>
and <HI>Jacob.</HI> The natural seed of <HI>Jacob,</HI> then (not according to
ours, but Gods own limits) is included in that covenant, in the
full latitude and extent of it.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s entred of God with <HI>Abraham</HI> as accepting the termes of it for himself and his natural issue.</NOTE> we do not say that this covenant was entred with
<HI>Abraham</HI> as a natural Father, nor his seed comprehended as na∣tural
children, we well know that <HI>quâ tale</HI> is <HI>omne,</HI> then all natn∣ral
parents were in Covenant, in that they had natural chil∣dren,
and all natural children were in Covenant, because they
were the natural issue of their parents. <HI>Abrahams</HI> Father was
a natural father, and <HI>Abraham</HI> was his natural son, yet neither of
them, upon that account were in covenant, we say it was entred
with <HI>Abraham,</HI> accepting the termes of it from God, for himself,
and his natural issue, all his natural issue, not by God himself ex∣cluded
were in covenant, He that made the covenant (according to
his good pleasure) might put limits to it; <HI>Abraham</HI> may be con∣sidered,
1. <HI>As a man,</HI> the Son of <HI>Terah,</HI> of the race of <HI>Adam. 2. As
accepting of Gods call,</HI> and receiving his tender for him and his.
3. <HI>As a faithful and an upright man,</HI> regenerate and stedfast in
covenant. It is not as man that God enters covenant in this la∣titude,
for <HI>Abraham</HI> himself was not thus in covenant, If he had
been in covenant, as a man, then no man had been out of cove∣nant:
Neither is it as an upright man before God, and keep∣ing
covenant, for those of his posterity, whose hearts were not
stedfast, were in covenant, and did hand it over to their seed, But
as a professour of the Faith accepting the covenant, taking God
for his God, in contradistinction to false gods, he accepted it for
himself and for his seed, his natural posterity. And all that
professe the faith hold in the like tenure, are in covenant, and
have the covenant; not vested in their own persons only, but en∣larged
to posterity.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant entitles to spi∣ritual mercies, and life eternal upon Gods termes and condition.</NOTE> we entitle the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as before, to spiritual
mercies, and so the seed of all that hold in the tenure of <HI>Abraham</HI>
to saving grace and life eternal; not by an absolute conveyance,
infallibly to inherit, we know, <HI>though Israel be as the sand of the
sea, yet a remnant only shall be saved,</HI> Rom. 9. 27. but upon Gods
termes, and conditions in the Gospel held out of God to his peo∣ple.
Salvation is made over by vertue of covenant, to all thus
in covenant, in that sense, as Christ speaks, <HI>John 4. 22. Salvation
<PB N="300" REF="168"/>
is of the Jews.</HI> In that sense as Christ useth it of <HI>Zacheus</HI> family;
<HI>This day is salvation come this house,</HI> Luke 19. 9. In that sense as
the Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> speaks of it, where he sets out the
danger of <HI>neglecting so great salvation,</HI> Heb. 2. 3. In that sense (as
I conceive) the Apostle speaks of it, where he saith, that upon the cal
of the Jews, <HI>All Israel shall be saved,</HI> Rom. 11. 26 They shall
enjoy those priviledges, in which salvation upon Gods terms may
be obtained, and this is all that can by any means be squeezed out
of their words, that say, the covenant of Grace was made of
God, with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his natural seed, or with beleevers and
their seed. It is even irksome to read the large businesse that is
made, to find out our meaning about the covenant of God made
with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed; and we must <HI>per force</HI> confesse that
we mean it of a covenant, infallibly, absolutely, to conferre
grace, and consequently salvation. To be so in Covenant, as that
a man cannot fall from it. To this end, words of mine are pro∣duced,
that I never uttered, and several arguments produced, a∣gainst
this supposed tenent and authorities multiplied out of Pro∣testant
Writers, <HI>Beza, Twisse, Wallaeus, The Annotations on the
Bible, Ames, Paraeus, Downham.</HI> I am content that all these Wor∣thies
shall still stand up in their honour, and that this shadow
should fall with shame, as well as I am that <HI>Bellarmine,
Stapleton, a Lapide, Becanus, Estius</HI> should fall with it, whose
arguments in this controversie one after other have been brought
against me. To draw all up towards a conclusion, All that is ne∣cessarily
included in Gods entrance of covenant with a people,
engaging to be their God, and taking them for his people; is
here by this grand Charter of Heaven made over to <HI>Abraham</HI> and
his natural issue by <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> All their posterity are
branches of this root by nature simply considered, and they are
holy branches by vertue of this covenant, which necessarily im∣plies
priviledge of Ordinances, the fruition of Gods Oracles,
which are his covenant-draughts; without which no people are
in Covenant, but all are strangers: And this priviledge of Or∣dinances
implies also all Priviledges, leading to, and accompany∣ing
salvation, and salvation it self upon Gods terms, in his word
revealed: and so before the disputation, the Reader hath my
supposition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arguments concluding the natural issue of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob to be taken into Covenant.</HEAD>
<P>MY first Argument is taken from the addition annext to
this covenant in the words immediately following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The natural issue of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> possest the land of <HI>Canaan</HI></NOTE> The
Lord having made a covenant in full words with <HI>Abraham</HI> and
his seed, he addes, <HI>and I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee,
the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of</HI> Canaan <HI>for an
everlasting possession, and I will be their God.</HI> That seed of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
that had possession of the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> through the gift, and
by vertue of the promise of God, is the seed here taken into co∣venant,
to have the Lord for their God. This is so plaine, that
nothing can be plainer to any that read the words. But the na∣tural
seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> all the seed of <HI>Jacob</HI> in their several Tribes,
(according as God set them their bounds) inherited the land of
<HI>Canaan,</HI> which is called the land of their inheritance, and not
onely the spiritual seed Regenerate. Look into the History of
of Scripture, who those were that inherited <HI>Canaan,</HI> and you
may see who were in this covenant; The natural seed were
there, and not only the spiritual, Even those of <HI>Abrahams</HI>
posterity <HI>that died, not having obtained the promises,</HI> Heb. 11. 13.
that only so journed in <HI>Canaan,</HI> and were never possest of it, had
title to it. It was theirs in reversion, though they never came
into actual possession.</P>
<P>My next Argument is drawn from the Seale that is annext in
the words immediately following this additional promise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Had the seal of Circumcision.</NOTE> <HI>ver. 9,
10, 11. And God said unto</HI> Abraham, <HI>thou shalt keep my covenant ther∣fore,
thou, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my
Covenant which you shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after
thee; every man-childe among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall
circumcise the flesh of your fore-skin, and it shall be a token of the
Covenant betwixt me and you.</HI> They that had the signe and seale
of the covenant, that had it by divine appointment, were
a people in Covenant. This is so plaine, that nothing can be
more plaine; God doth not enter covenant with one, and give
<PB N="302" REF="169"/>
the signe and seal to another: but all the natural seed of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
by <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> had the seal, <HI>viz.</HI> all the males, all those
that were in a capacity of it, it was not limitted to the spiritual
seed. There had been no place for that distinction of Circum∣cision
in the flesh, and Circumcision of the heart; if none must
be circumcised in flesh, but those that are circumcised in
heart.</P>
<P>My third Argument is drawn from the Comment that God
himself makes of this covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Were owned of God as his people.</NOTE> in the whole <HI>Series</HI> of Scripture-history,
holding it out every where in this way of tenure, to <HI>A∣braham</HI>
and his natural issue, as before; Where God himself speaks
to the whole body of <HI>Israel</HI> when they were newly come up out
of the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> he sayes, <HI>I am the Lord your God,</HI> Exod.
20 2. Deut. 5. 6. God owned all of that whole people as his, all
of them being <HI>Abrahams</HI> natural issue, yet all of them were not
spiritual▪ and while they were in <HI>Egypt,</HI> God speaks of them all
in community as his; <HI>Let my people go, that they may hold a feast
unto me in the wildernesse,</HI> Exod. 5. 1. We see the titles that he
gives them, <HI>Children of the Lord your God, an holy People, a pecu∣liar
People above all Nations,</HI> Deut. 14. 1, 2. That speech of the
Lord to <HI>Israel, Amos</HI> 3. 1, 2. is very full to our purpose: <HI>Heare
ye the Word of the Lord that he hath spoken against you, O children
of</HI> Israel, <HI>against the whole family which I brought up from the
land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>saying, You only have I known of all the families
of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</HI> Eve∣ry
one that descended from <HI>Jacob,</HI> the whole of the family that
came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> were a select people to God in covenant; He
was according to the termes of that Covenant, <HI>their God.</HI> There
is not a place, where God calls them by the name of his people
(which are almost endlesse;) but there we have this confirmed,
that that people were the Lords by vertue of this grant made to
<HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed.</P>
<P>In the fourth place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pleaded their interest in the Covenant for obtaining of mercy.</NOTE> I argue from the practice of the people of
God, making this Covenant of God entred with <HI>Abraham</HI> and
his seed, a plea to obtaine mercy from God for all <HI>Israel,</HI> the
worst of <HI>Israel,</HI> in their lowest state and condition, <HI>Deut. 9 26,
27. O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine in heritance, which
thou hast redeemed through thy greatnesse, which thou hast brought
forth out of</HI> Egypt <HI>with a mighty hand. Remember thy servants</HI> A∣braham,
<PB N="303" REF="169"/>
Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>look not unto the stubbornnesse of this peo∣ple,
nor to their wickednesse, nor to their sinne.</HI> If this Divinity
had been then known, <HI>Moses</HI> might have been sent away with this
answer; <HI>That he spake for dogges, and not for children; not for</HI> Is∣rael,
<HI>but for aliens and strangers to the Common-wealth of</HI> Israel.
But as this and the like requests of the people of God were made
in faith, so they prevailed with God; <HI>Moses</HI> there urges, <HI>They
are thy people, and thine inheritance,</HI> verse 29. as doth the Church,
Isa. 64. 9. <HI>Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember ini∣quity
for ever; behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people;</HI> and
<HI>Moses</HI> petition takes as the History shews, <HI>Exod. 32. 14. And
the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people;</HI>
yea, when God vouchsafes mercy to his people thus in covenant,
<HI>Levit.</HI> 26. 42. it is upon this account of the Covenant; <HI>Then will
I remember my Covenant with</HI> Jacob, <HI>and also my Covenant with</HI>
Isaac, <HI>and also my covenant with</HI> Abraham <HI>will I remember, and I
will remember the land,</HI> Lev. 26. 42. And appearing for the deli∣verance
of <HI>Israel</HI> out of their hard and pressing bondage; he saith
to <HI>Moses, I am the God of thy Father, the God of</HI> Abraham, <HI>the God of</HI>
Isaac, <HI>and the God of</HI> Jacob, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3. 6. and that to stay up his faith
in confidence of deliverance.</P>
<P><HI>To this here in this place delivered one replies,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> The Covenant
(<HI>saith he</HI>) with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed I finde, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. and the
urging of this covenant I deny not, <HI>Exod. 32. 13. Deut. 9. 27. Lev.
26. 42. Exod.</HI> 3. 6. And though I say not that it contained
only the promise of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but grant it contained the Promise of
Redemption by Christ, <HI>Luke</HI> 1. 17. yet I like not <HI>Chamiers</HI> say∣ing,
to call the Promise of <HI>Canaan</HI> an appendant to the covenant,
sith the Holy Ghost me thinks speaks otherwise, <HI>Psalme</HI> 105. 8,
9. 10, 11.</P>
<P>I shall say no more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> but leave it to the Reader, whether this
be any answer, only for his censure of <HI>Chamiers</HI> calling the pro∣mise
of the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> an appendant to this covenant;
the thing is so clear in the narrative of it, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. that nothing
can be more evident. The Covenant is full, <HI>vers. 7. To be a God
to</HI> Abraham <HI>and to his seed,</HI> and this he might have been had he
pleased, in the land of <HI>Vr</HI> of the <HI>Caldees,</HI> or in any land what∣soever
where <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed had been planted: But when the co∣venant
is thus made, there is added; <HI>And I will give unto thee, and to
<PB N="304" REF="170"/>
thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the
land of</HI> Canaan <HI>for an everlasting possession.</HI> As for that of the <HI>Psal∣mist,</HI>
where he thinks the holy Ghost speaks otherwise; the force of
this Argument must needs be this. That which is any where
called a Covenant, that is not an appendant to a covenant; but
the giving of the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> to the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> is there
called by the name of a Covenant. He will not, I think, say,
that Circumcision is the Covenant between God and his peo∣ple,
he will not deny, but it is a signe and seale annext to the co∣venant;
and yet, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 10. it is called a Covenant, <HI>This is
my Covenant which she shall keep between me and you, and thy seed
after thee, every man-childe among you shall be circumcised.</HI> Me∣tonimies
of the adjunct are well enough known, and the common
use of them in Scripture; but that it is his wisdome for his advan∣tage
to conceale it.</P>
<P>My fifth and last argument is drawn from those several Texts
in the New Testament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Testa∣ment Scri∣ptures conclu∣ding <HI>Abrahams</HI> natural seed to be in Cove∣nant.</NOTE> which interpret this Covenant thus en∣tred
with <HI>Abraham,</HI> in that latitude; as extending to his natu∣ral
issue, and not with limit to his spiritual seed; and that not
barely in domestick or civil, but in spiritual promises; so that this
one hath many in the bowels of it.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom 9 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>Rom. 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. verses.</HI> The Apostle aggravating
in the highest and saddest way, that great heavinesse, aud conti∣nual
sorrow of heart, that he had for <HI>Israel;</HI> (not respective to
civil or domestick, but higher concernments,) even for the whole
body of <HI>Israel;</HI> his brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh,
as he expresseth himself, <HI>v.</HI> 3. For amplification of the real grounds
of his trouble, that such a people should be cast off; he reckons
up their priviledges, the priviledges of all that according to the
flesh were Israelites; Priviledges formerly enjoyed, but now lost,
nine in number: <HI>Who are Israelites, to whom appertaines the A∣doption,
and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the
Law, and the service of God, and the Promises? Whose are the
Fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who
is over all, God blessed for ever,</HI> Amen. Here sure is enough to con∣clude
them of the seed thus in covenant, to be of Gods adopted seed
under the Promises.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. Throughout.</NOTE> <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. Throughout the whole body of the <HI>chap∣ter,</HI>
the Apostle speaks of the casting off of Gods people.
<PB N="305" REF="170"/>
Those that are cast off from being a people of God, were once his
people; those that are put out of covenant, were a people in
Covenant; but the natural issue of <HI>Abraham</HI> (called <HI>natural
branches,</HI> verse 21. being by right of birth of that Olive) are there
broken off, cast off; therefore the natural issue was the seed in co∣venant.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 8. 11, 12</NOTE> <HI>Mat.</HI> 8. 11, 12. Upon occasion of the Faith of the
<HI>Centurion,</HI> which Christ so magnifies, and preferres before the
faith of any in <HI>Israel;</HI> he prophecies of the call of the Gentiles,
and the rejection of the Jewes, <HI>I say unto you, that many shall
come from the East, and West, and shall sit down with</HI> Abraham, <HI>and</HI>
Isaac, <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>in the Kingdome of heaven: But the children of
the Kingdome shall be cast out into utter darknesse, there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.</HI> Nations from all quarters of the
world, every point of the Heavens shall embrace the Faith, and
be received visible members of the Kingdom of God; when the
children of the Kingdome that are now in it, and enjoy it, shall
be cast out of it; children of the Kingdome that are to be cast
out, are in the Kingdome only upon an interest of birth, for the
fruition of the priviledges of Ordinances, and not upon any spiri∣tual
title, infallibly giving interest in Salvation: But the chil∣dren
of the Kingdome were upon our Saviours sentence to be cast
out, therefore they were in the Kingdome only on an interest of
Birth.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 2. 15</NOTE> <HI>Gal</HI> 2. 15. In that chapter among other things we have
a narrative from the Apostle, of his dealing by way of reproof with
<HI>Peter</HI> at <HI>Antioch.</HI> In which we may observe.</P>
<P>(1.) <HI>The occasion given by</HI> Peter, <HI>vers.</HI> 12. Before that certain
came from <HI>James,</HI> he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were
come, he withdrew and separated himself.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>The issue which followed upon this carriage of his,</HI> And
the other Jewes dissembled likewise with him, insomuch
that <HI>Barnabas</HI> also was carried away with their dissimula∣tion.</P>
<P>(3.) Arguments brought for conviction of <HI>Peter</HI> of this error,
which are two. The first in the 14. vers. <HI>If thou being a
Jew livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jewes,
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jewes?</HI> Thus the
Argument runnes; It is unreasonable to draw others into a
<PB N="306" REF="171"/>
practice that thou thy self purposely forbearest; But thou thy
self keepest not the Jewish Rites and Ordinances, and therefore
it is an unreasonable and blame-worthy practice, by thy example
to compel others to their observation; yea, thou being a Jew,
takest thy self to have freedome unreasonably, then dost thou
draw on others, who were never under any such obligation.
The second Argument is in the 15. and 16. <HI>verses, We who are
Jewes by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles; knowing that a man
is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ,
even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by
the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law; for by the works of
the Law shall no flesh be justified,</HI> which is thus enforced. In that way
wherein we who are Jews, with all our birth-priviledges cannot at∣tain
to righteousness, we may not teach the Gentiles to attain to it.
But we who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
cannot this way attaine to righteousnesse. We know that a man is
justified by faith; we are compelled to quit the Law, and to cleave
to Faith without works, for justification. These words which
come up to our present purpose, containe. (1.) The priviledge
of <HI>Peter, Paul, Barnabas</HI> with the rest of the Jewes. (2.) The
character of the Gentiles in opposition to the Jewes▪ As to the
full purpose for which these words are brought by the Apostle,
they have for the sense of them their dependance on the words
that follow; but so farre as they containe the priviledge of
the Jewes, in opposition to, and above the Gentiles, (to which we
are to speak) so farre they are full of themselves; shewing, First,
Positively, what himself and <HI>Peter</HI> were, <HI>Jewes by nature.</HI> Second∣ly,
Negatively, what they were not, <HI>sinners of the Gentiles.</HI> Where
[nature] is taken, not in the proper, but vulgar acceptation, for
birth or descent from Ancestours, as usually in our common phrase
of speech we say, men are naturally <HI>Dutch, French, Spanish, Irish,</HI>
when they are such borne and bred; This Scripture therefore <HI>Ca∣mero</HI>
cites for one, in which the Apostle speaks after the vulgar
manner. We have a Scripture parallel with this. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 24.
wher <HI>[nature]</HI> and <HI>[natural]</HI> is only by birth and off spring, <HI>Peter,
Paul, Barnabas</HI> were all naturally Jewes, borne of Jewish Pa∣rents,
and bred up in the way and Religion of the Jewes; such
onely Christ chose for Apostles, being himself a Minister of the
Circumcision. <HI>Peter</HI> therefore being one of the twelve must ne∣cessarily
<PB N="307" REF="171"/>
be such, <HI>Paul</HI> was such▪ as we know from his own mouth,
<HI>a Jew, and of the Tribe of</HI> Benjamine <HI>Barnabas</HI> was such, <HI>of the
Tribe of</HI> Levi. And being such they enjoyed a priviledge which
the Gentiles wanted, they were by birth and off-spring of a Na∣tion
that is holy. No Nation was so great as they, who had God
so nigh unto them, who had statutes and judgements so righte∣ous.
The Jew had every way prerogatives and advantages, but
chiefly the Oracles of God. God had not dealt so with every
Nation; when other Nations were without God, they had God
nigh unto them; when others were uncleane, they were holy.
This great priviledge of Birth, Gentiles wanted, and so were by
off-spring sinners; as Birth renders all, so they remaine unholy
and uncleane, among the unholy and unclean without any such
title to the Covenant of God, that thereby they might obtaine
any other denomination; they are dogs, while the people in Co∣venant
are children. And by this means the seeming opposition
which is between this text and that of the Apostle, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 3.
is easily reconciled. Here the Apostle makes an opposition na∣ture,
between Jews and Gentiles; Jewes by nature had privi∣ledge
above Gentiles. There he makes Jewes and Gentiles in
nature equal? <HI>We</HI> (saith he) <HI>were by nature children of wrath
as well as others,</HI> as well as Heathens, that have no Birrh privi∣ledge
<HI>[Nature]</HI> in that Text is not the same as nature in this <HI>[Na∣ture]</HI>
there is taken for the qualification of nature, which is equal∣ly
defiled in Jewes and Gentiles, which is there evidenced in the
conversation of the Jewes, being (before convertion by grace)
the very same with the Gentiles. <HI>Among whom also we all had
our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling
the desires of the flesh and of the minde, and were by nature
children of wrath, even as others. [Nature]</HI> here is taken for a
Birth-priviledge, and so the Jews (though in themselves sinners) are
reputed an holy people a people by covenant holy to the Lord.
<HI>Nature</HI> simpl considered, is stained, and renders Jewes and Gen∣tiles
equally sinners and obnoxious to Gods wrath; of which,
Justification by faith is an acknowledgement, as the Apostle here
shews, <HI>verse</HI> 17. But birth of Jewish Ancestors, of the stock of
<HI>Israel</HI> puts them into a select condition, into the number of a
people holy to the Lord. Neither is this any contradiction;
common things dedicated for holy service and use, are holy: A
<PB N="308" REF="172"/>
people by nature sinners dedicated to the Lord, are for holy ser∣vice
and use, for the service of the Lord, when others are for ser∣vice
of idols. Therefore <HI>jerusalem</HI> a City, none of the holiest for
any transcendent manners of the inhabitants thereof, is yet called
by the Evangelist, <HI>the holy City,</HI> by reason of the Temple and wor∣ship
there, that were holy.</P>
<P>That which is a priviledge of nature or birth, belongs to the
natural issue, that cannot be denied: But to be incovenant with
God as a people holy and exceeding others that are without as
sinners, is a priviledge of nature or birth; therefore this priviledge
belongs to the natural issue. This Argument, as it is cleare of it
selfe, so it hath this advantage, that for interpretation of the
word <HI>[Nature]</HI> it hath approbation from profest adversaries;
one saith, <HI>I grant his sense of the word</HI> Nature, <HI>and that the
Apostle there speaks of himself and other Jewes, as in reputation
more holy then the Gentiles, because of their interest in Circumcision,
and observance of</HI> Moses <HI>Law;</HI> And this grant involves him not
in a few contradictions. 1. That this was a Birth-priviledge as he
here acknowledges, being the Jews priviledge by birth of nature,
and therefore belonged to the natural seed; when<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> elsewhere he
saith, they inherit onely domestick and civil benefits. 2. This inter∣est
in Circumcision, and observance of <HI>Moses</HI> Law, was a privi∣ledge
of Ordinances, and he is wont to deny, that birth entitles
any to such priviledges. 3. This is spiritual mercy which the Jews
here had in Circumcision, and <HI>Moses</HI> Law. Circumcision by
his confession seales Gospei-mercies, the same that Baptism seal∣eth.
And <HI>Moses</HI> in the Law wrote of Christ <HI>John 1 45. John</HI> 5. 46.
and yet he denies the natural seed any Promise of spiritual mercies.
Any one of these arguments severally, much more all joyntly make
good this Position, that all the natural seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> by <HI>Isaac</HI>
and <HI>Jacob</HI> are in that great Charter (vouchsafed of God) taken into
covenant, so as to be the people of God, and to enjoy all priviled∣ges
of his people, in order (upon Gods termes) to everlasting sal∣vation.</P>

<P><HI>THough I hear of none that have much to say to all these Scri∣ptures,
as indeed little, rather nothing can be said; they hold
forth with so clear a light a covenant in that latitude, and with
those prerogatives, as you have heard; yet one hath a Text of
Scripture, not to clear any one, but to silence and overthrow
them all, and that is the words of the Apostle,</HI> Rom. 9. 6, 7, 8.
<HI>where the Apostle (having sufficiently hinted to them the reje∣ction
of a great part of the Jews, in his profession of that great
heavinesse and sorrow of heart in their behalf, and that he could
wish that himself were accursed from Christ for them) undertakes
to answer an objection.</HI> If <HI>Israel</HI> be cast off then the Word of God will
be of none effect, his promise will faile; But the promise of God made
with his people cannot faile, therefore <HI>Israel</HI> in such a considerable num∣ber

now is the apple of our contention, was brought into question. <HI>This Ar∣gument

Stapleton <HI>in his antidote, undertaking to make
good that</HI> Calvin <HI>contradicts the Apost. (which
he puts into his Marg.) saith, Calvin</HI> says, that the
whole progeny of <HI>Abraham</HI> is holy, because God
entred the covenant of life with him in these
words; I will be a God to thee and thy seed, that
is according to <HI>Calvin,</HI> to all that shall
descend from him, to all that according to the
flesh are borne to him, as also now (the partition-wall
being taken away) to all the children of
Christians, which according to the flesh shal be born
to them; And <HI>Calvin</HI> addeth (<HI>saith he</HI>) that God
calls all of the off-spring of <HI>Israel</HI> his children;
But (<HI>saith he</HI>) the Apostle speaks the contrary
expressely. They are not all <HI>Israel</HI> that are of
<PB N="310" REF="173"/>
<HI>Israel,</HI> neither because they are the seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> are they all child∣ren,
but in <HI>Isaac</HI> shal thy seed be caled; that is, they that are the children
of the flesh, those are not the children of God, but the children of the pro∣mise
are counted for the seed. But (<HI>saith he</HI>) the children of the pro∣mise
are children born after the Spirit, whether they descended from
<HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> or no, <HI>with much more to this purpose. We
have drunk up the Protestants poison, and their great care is,
to preserve their party by the Jesuites antidote; They are whol∣ly
beholding to them for the receipt; what</HI> probatum est <HI>they can
write upon it, must be examined. And that they may not
deny, but in the examination of this triumphing Argument, they
have square dealing, I shall give you the Authours words at
length.</HI> I deny not (<HI>saith he</HI>) but there was some other promise in∣cluded
in that objection, to wit, some promise made to <HI>Israel,</HI> or
the house of <HI>Israel,</HI> probably that, <HI>Jerem.</HI> 31. 33, 36, 37. For
so the words, <HI>verse</HI> 6. They are not all <HI>Israel</HI> which are of <HI>Israel,</HI> do
intimate. But without question the promise made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen.
17. 7. was one which was included in that objection; <HI>Beza, Twisse,
Ames,</HI> and others answering <HI>Arminius,</HI> call it the Covenant of God
with <HI>Abraham,</HI> which was that, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. and the very phrase of
<HI>Abrahams</HI> seed (in <HI>Isaac</HI> shall thy seed be called, <HI>verse</HI> 7. The chil∣dren
of the promise are counted for the seed, <HI>verse 8. Sarah</HI> shall have
a sonne, as <HI>verse</HI> 9.) do evidently shew, that the promise (objected to
prove, that if the Jews were rejected from being Gods people, then God
failed in making good his word) was that promise to <HI>Abraham;</HI> I will
be thy God, and the God of thy seed; whereto I may adde that the an∣swerers
of <HI>Arminius,</HI> and the cited Remonstrants, to wit, <HI>Baine,</HI> and
<HI>Ames,</HI> do say it was the word of promise, not of the Law as <HI>Arminius</HI>
conceived; for the word of promise saith <HI>Ames, Animadv in Remon∣stran.
Script. Synod. de praedest. Cap. 8. Sect.</HI> 4. is distinguished
and opposed to the words of the Law, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 17, 18. Now the word
of the promise there is to <HI>Abraham</HI> and his seed, <HI>verse</HI> 16. and this is
there called by him <HI>verbum foederis,</HI> the word of the Covenant; now
let us consider how the Apostle answers it. He denies that Gods Word
made to <HI>Abraham</HI> did fall, though the Jews were rejected; because
that promise, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed; as it compre∣hended
saving grace, was never meant by God of all <HI>Abraham</HI> poste∣rity,
or of any barely as they were descended from <HI>Abraham</HI> by na∣tural
generation; but of the Elect, whether descended by natural gene∣ration
<PB N="311" REF="173"/>
from <HI>Abraham</HI> or not. And this is apparent, both from the
words, <HI>vers.</HI> 7. Neither because they are the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> are
they all children, but in <HI>Isaac</HI> shall thy seed be called, <HI>vers.</HI> 8. It is
expounded thus; that is, they which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted
for the seed. Whence it is apparent, that the same are not always the
seed by calling, which are the seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> by natural generati∣on;
and that the children of the flesh are not the same with the chil∣dren
of the promise, and that the Apostle conceived this the right may of
answering those that objected the falling of Gods word; upon the rejection
of the Jews, by restraining the promise of being God to <HI>Abrahams</HI>
seed, only to the Elect, whether of <HI>Abrahams</HI> natural posterity or not;
with so little respect to any birth-right-priviledge, that he not onely
rejected <HI>Ishmael,</HI> and took <HI>Isaac,</HI> but also loved <HI>Jacob,</HI> and hated
<HI>Esau;</HI> by prophecie declaring his minde, The elder shall serve the
younger, and in this, the Apostle acquits God from unrighteousnesse,
in that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
will he hardens; notwithstanding his promise made to <HI>Abraham</HI> and
<HI>Israel,</HI> or any Birth-priviledge they could claime. <HI>Yeelding that
this Text in that place is brought into question by the Apostle:
Before I come to the Apostles words themselves, I have divers
Queres to put.</HI></P>
<P>1. How <HI>Baine</HI> and <HI>Ames</HI> come to the name of <HI>Remonstrants?</HI> I
had thought they had been on the party that are called <HI>Contra-Remonstrants?</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Where it appears that</HI> Arminius <HI>conceived that the
covenant there spoken to, was the word of the Law, and not of
Promise; I am sure in his Analysis on this Chapter to the</HI> Romans
<HI>he speaks in another manner, even in our authours own</HI> Dialect, <HI>as
though the ones Comment had been spit out of the mouth of
the other.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Filii carnis Apostolo hoc loco sunt qui per o era legis justitiam &amp; salutem consect∣antur.

from the rejection of the Jews, Gods failing in his promise.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Si verbum Dei solos filios comprehendit, exclusis filiis carnis, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quitur verbum Dei non ex idere, etiamsi filii carnis reji<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iantur imò exidere si admitterentur isti qui <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>riptione ipsa conditionis foederis ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luntur, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bum Dei <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>los filios promissionis com¦prehendit, exclusis filiis. carnis.

<HI>out the sons of the flesh; then it follows that the word of God doth
not faile though the sons of the flesh be rejected: But the word of
God comprehends only the sons of promise, shutting out the sonnes of the
flesh: Therefore the word of God doth not faile, though the sons of the
flesh be rejected.</HI> Armin. Anal. Cap. 9. ad Ro. p. 781. Let any now
judge whether he can interpret this of the Law and not of the
promise.</P>
<P>3. When he affirmes that to be borne after the flesh is all one
with the Apostle, with legal justiciaries, as he doth (which is <HI>Ar∣minius</HI>
his Interpretation) how then can he by that distinction of
children of the flesh, and children of the promise, shut out the na∣tural
seed of <HI>Abraham?</HI> are the natural seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and legal
justiciaries one and the same?</P>
<P>4. If the Apostle exclude all the natural seed of <HI>Abraham</HI>
from this Covenant of God (as <HI>Stapleton</HI> argues, and from him
the Anabaptists) and takes in only his spiritual seed, how
can he be reconciled to himself? in the words immediately before
this objection, he speaks of the Jewes (as his kinsmen according
to the flesh, which were the natural seed of <HI>Abraham</HI>) and saith,
<HI>To them pertaine the Adoption, the Glory, and the Covenants, &amp;c.</HI>
How then can his distinction be interpreted to throw them out
of Covenant, when in expresse termes he had affirmed that they
were in covenant? How can he deny that these are children,
<HI>vers.</HI> 7. when he had affirmed that to them pertaineth the Adopti∣on,
<HI>vers.</HI> 4. Which may be confirmed by abundant other Texts
of Scripture; <HI>Ye are the children of the Lord your God,</HI> Deut. 14. 1.
<HI>Out of</HI> Egypt <HI>have I called my Sonne,</HI> Hosea. 11. 1. <HI>It is not meet
to take the childrens bread, and cast it unto Dogges,</HI> Matth. 15. 26.
where all that were not Gentiles, all to whom Christ was sent,
are called children; <HI>Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the
Covenant which God made with your Fathers,</HI> Acts 3. 20. Doth
the Covenant appertaine to them, and they stiled the children of
the Covenant, and yet are they out of Covenant? Are they
children to whom the Adoption pertaines, and yet no children?
When they have given any faire answer to these Quere's, espe∣cially
the two last: we shall conceive some probability of
truth in their Glosse on the Apostles words; in the meane time
we cannot but look upon it in full opposition and contradiction
to that which the Apostle expressely delivers. For the Text of
<PB N="313" REF="174"/>
the Apostle, it will be besides my purpose to make any full Com∣ment
upon it; it will be sufficient to take it out of their hands,
and vindicate it from that which they would assert from it,
and to let the Reader know the Apostles scope in that place,
which is not to make a full Comment on those words, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7.
but only to free it from an objection which the unbeleeving Jews
might raise from it. God hath made a Covenant with them, <HI>to
be their God, and the God of their seed.</HI> If he now cast them off as the
Apostle doth affirme, the Covenant then is broke, <HI>and the word
of God is of none effect.</HI> The Apostle denies that this follows, and
shews that the terme <HI>[Israel,]</HI> or <HI>[children of</HI> Abraham.] admits
of distinction, and produces a Scripture, <HI>vers.</HI> 7. where one di∣stinction
is implied, <HI>viz. Gen. 21. 12. In</HI> Isaac <HI>shall thy seed be cal∣led,</HI>
and so a numerous company by <HI>Ishmael</HI> is excluded (who
were <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed after the flesh) and only the sons of promise
by <HI>Isaac</HI> are accounted the seed, <HI>vers.</HI> 8. that come from <HI>Isaac,</HI>
borne by miracle. And <HI>verse</HI> 10, 11, 12, 13. seconds it with o∣thers
concerning the children of <HI>Isaac, Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> As then
there was a distinction of seed; so also now, one member he had
laid down before, <HI>viz. Israelites according to the flesh</HI> vested in
all those priviledges there reckoned up, <HI>ver.</HI> 4, 5. These they
pleaded, and the Apostle yeelds them; And these men (accord∣ing
to the discovery of these times) deny them. The second
member he after falls upon, <HI>the eternally beloved and chosen of
God,</HI> and largely amplifies. In these <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed may continue,
though the other be cast off; to whom yet God hath continued
(in successive generations) a God in covenant, and continued
to them the priviledges of being his people, though now he was
upon the rejection of them: And that it may appear that I go
not alone, I shall give an Exposition of this Text from a more
able Penne, above the suspition of an <HI>Arminian,</HI> which is here char∣ged,

conclusion (in which he denies that Gods word concerning the Cove∣nant
<PB N="314" REF="175"/>
with</HI> Abraham <HI>and his seed, and the blessing and salvation by
the promised</HI> Messiah, Gal. 3. 17. <HI>did fall, or become void) is mani∣fest,
though the greatest part of the Jews be shut out from Christ, and
accursed. And this he proves by distinguishing Israelites and the
seed of</HI> Abraham; <HI>and thereby shews that the promise of God, respe∣ctive
to the efficacy of it, is indefinite, and therefore particular, not
universal, and so an universal promise cannot rightly from thence
be concluded: for though the Israelites for a great part perish, yet
that the promise of God is not thereby made void appeares, in that it
hath its efficacy in the Elect; for as he saith,</HI> verse 6. <HI>All which are
of</HI> Israel (<HI>borne according to the flesh) are not true Israelites, to
whom not only the tender of the Covenant of Grace, with condition of
duty to be performed; but the heavenly possession and inheritance only
belongs, as in</HI> ver. 7. <HI>and</HI> Rom 2. 28, 29. <HI>is more fully shewn; Nei∣ther
because they are the seed of</HI> Abraham, <HI>are they therefore all chil∣dren,
or heirs of that blessing, and partakers of the same grace and
glory, as</HI> Rom. 4. 12. Gal. 4. 28. <HI>For though these things seem con∣tradictory
to themselves, and to that also which was delivered be∣fore,
where the Apostle affirmes that the unbeleeving Jews are</HI> A∣brahamites,
<HI>and Israelites; not only by reason of their birth after the
flesh, but also by reason of acceptance of the Covenants, and promises,
yet there is no contradiction; For though the Fathers, and Adoption,
and Covenants, and Promises belong to all the Israelites, yet all
<PB N="315" REF="175"/>
are not therefore true children, and heirs of salvation. For these
things which are objected,</HI> viz. <HI>The Jewes great priviledges, are
attributed by the Apostle to the unbeleeving Jewes, by vertue of their
outward call, because salvation is revealed and offered to them under
condition of obedience, and that offer sealed with Circumcision, from
whence all Israelites are promiscuously called children of the covenant,
as</HI> Acts 3. 25.) <HI>and not by reason of their inward call according to the
purpose of Election effectual, because salvation is not only outward∣ly
under condition of a lively faith revealed and offered in the word,
and sealed in the Sacrament; but also inwardly and efficaciously, (the
condition, that is, faith being given them) is conferred by the Holy
Ghost. For this belongs not indifferently to all, but only to the ge∣nuine

<P>It is farther said,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> that when the Pharisees and Sadduces came
to <HI>Johns</HI> Baptisme, and were about to plead this Birth-priviledge;
<HI>John</HI> beats them off it, and takes that plea out of their mouths:
<HI>Think not to say within your selves, we have</HI> Abraham <HI>to our father,</HI>
Matth. 3. 9. that plea could not stand when the men were
carnal.</P>
<P>I answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> First, when those that were no better than these,
make the same plea, <HI>John 8. 33. We be</HI> Abrahams <HI>seed, and were

ye are</HI> Abrahams <HI>seed;</HI> he allows them all that upon this account
they can claime. And for Pharisees he doth not barely yeeld them
to be Church-Members, but also Church-Teachers, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23. 2.
2. I say <HI>John Baptist</HI> doth not deny what Christ yeelds, but lets
them know, that this plea, will not serve to avoid wrath, while
they live in impenitence; They may perish notwithstanding
this plea, and yet Gods Covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> hold; be∣ing
able of stones to raise up children unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> to make
good what in Covenant he had said. He no where sayes that
they are not entitled to priviledges of Ordinances, and thereby

interessed in the prerogatives of Gods visible people. What <HI>Paul,</HI>
Rom. 9. 4, 5. so largely yeelds them, <HI>John Baptist</HI> in that place
doth not deny them, which also now they had in visible possessi∣on.

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Covenant in New Testament-times takes in pa∣rents
with their children.</HEAD>
<P>BUt in case all this be yeelded in Old Testament-times, that
the Covenant entred was in this latitude, that the whole of
<HI>Abrahams</HI> seed were taken with him into Covenant, and that
then it ran in a race by carnal descent, yet it is otherwise at least
in New Testament-times. No childe fares now the better
respective to any visible Church-interest, for the Faith or Reli∣gion
of their Ancestours. And here is a fourth difference be∣tween
the first and second, the Old and New Covenant accord∣ing
to some. The first Covenant was entred in that latitude, to
take in Children with their parents, Posterity with their Ance∣stours,
according to the Charter so long infisted upon: But in
New Testament-times, the Covenant reaches no farther then the
person that actually enters; He covenants for himself, his seed
have no more or farther interest then the seed of Heathens and
Pagans. When I first published my <HI>Birth-priviledge,</HI> I here ex∣pected
opposition, and did look▪ that some would appeare to put
this limit to the Covenant in New Testament-times▪ but for the
state of the Church under the first covenant I thought I should
not have found an opposite, and therefore was lesse mindful of the
confirmation of it, which I hope is now done to the Readers full
satisfaction. As to those that plead such a change of things in
New Testament-times, we might interrogate them in sundry par∣ticulars.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="176"/>
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quere's pre∣mised.</NOTE> when God by free Charter, did once vouchsafe such a grant
to his people, how it can be made appear that it was ever re∣versed;
or any such limit put to it, when the Church of God
hath held it in see from <HI>Abraham</HI> to this present hour, they may
well look that they should produce some plaine word from God
(revoking his grant) that challenge them for usurpation. It is
true that Gods Sovereignty is such that he may contract his grace
at pleasure; As he may wholly strike a people out of covenant, so
he may put what termes he pleases to it; but such that affirme it
should make it appear, in which hitherto they have been silent.
They that will eject us out of so long a possession, had need to
make their plea firm for our eviction.</P>
<P>Secondly, we might demand the reasons why the Covenant
should run in so narrow a limit now, being vouchsafed in so great
a latitude then▪ being once made of God as with men of yeares,
so with little ones, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. Why should little ones be now ex∣cluded,
and onely men of growth admitted? when it is granted
on all hands that God continues a people to himself, how comes
it to passe that he admits them on such new termes? That his fa∣vours
are now thus shortened, that as a lease for terme of life,
differs from a fee-simple for inheritance, so the Covenant in New
Testament-times differs from the Covenant vouchsafed of God
to our fathers? Where the absurdity lies that Baptisme should
be administred to those that do not actually beleeve, when yet
Circumcision was administred to infants in as great an inca∣pacity.</P>
<P>Thirdly, we might demand how they can avoid that great scan∣dall
that must needs by this meanes be given to the beleeving
Jewes, (who waved the old way of the administration of the cove∣nant,
and embraced the new) to have their infants upon this new
admission struck out of Covenant, A man that should be sei∣zed
on an inheritance for ever, will hardly be brought to quit that
tenure and accept with limit for terme of life, <HI>God was their God,
and the God of their seed,</HI> Gen. 17. 7. <HI>They did bring forth children to
God,</HI> Ezek. 16. 20. Now they bring forth children without
God. They have a seed, but no holy seed; a world replenished,
but not a Church or people to God continued; The savage Indi∣ans
in a married condition have this priviledge▪ that their issue are
not bastards, and this is all that can be claimed by Christians.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="177"/>
Fourthly, we might demand if so great a change were made and
held in the Apostolique Primitive times, how it comes to passe
that there was such silence, no man moving a question about it?
The pomp of worship and observation of places formerly in use,
was laid aside in Gospel-times, but this we hear of, and the reason
of it, <HI>John▪</HI> 4. 22. The initiating Sacrament of Circumcision had a
period put to it, of this we hear, and many complaints about it?
Psalteries, Harps, Organs, Cymbals, and such instruments of mu∣sick,
in use in the time of the Law, were laid aside in Gospel-times,
and not known in the westerne Churches till after <HI>Thomas Aqui∣nas</HI>
his dayes; As this was done, so it was not past in silence, but
spoken of, (as elsewhere I have shewn, and given reasons of it) by
<HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> [or at least one that beares his name,] <HI>Chrysostome,
Isidore, Thomas Aquinas.</HI> When none of these changes can passe,
but observation is made, it is more then strange that so great a
change as this in the termes of the Covenant, between God and
his people, can be so carried on without any observation at all, or
one word once moved about it, or spoken in it? See Master <HI>Bax∣ters</HI>
Treatise of <HI>Infants Church-membership,</HI> proving that Infants
were sometimes Church-members, <HI>page</HI> 26, 27. that there is no re∣peale
of this grant vouchsafed of God, <HI>p.</HI> 27, 28. Waiting for some
faire answer to the former demands, I shall proceed to those
texts of Scripture, where the Covenant in New Testament-times
is held out in this latitude to beleevers and their seed, comprizing
their parents in the same priviledge of Covenant and participati∣on
of promise.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 2. 38, 39 vindicated.</NOTE> let us look into those words of <HI>Peter,</HI> delivered in his first
Sermon after the receiving of the holy Ghost, (the first place in
which the Covenant of promise, and Baptisme the Seale of the
Covenant are mentioned) to the Jewes, with whom the A∣postles
as yet held communion being not actually rejected out
of a visible Church-state; <HI>Repent, and be baptised every one of
you in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sinnes,
and ye shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
you and to your children, and to all that are afarre off, even as many
as the Lord our God shall call,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nalized.</NOTE> Acts 2. 38, 39. In which words we
may observe. 1. An Exhortation, as, to repentance for the
guilt of the blood of Christ; (of which they stood convinced)
so, also unto Baptisme. 2. A Motive stirring them up to
<PB N="319" REF="177"/>
embrace baptisme in the name of Christ, drawn from the benefit
which they shall reap, <HI>Ye shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost.</HI>
3. A farther encouragement to the acceptation of Baptism drawn
from their Covenant-priviledge, which is here set out in its full
latitude and extent (as <HI>Calvin</HI> rightly upon the words observeth)
1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Jewes, <HI>For the promise is unto you.</HI> 2. To their children,
<HI>and to your children.</HI> 3. To the Gentiles upon call, <HI>and to you that
are afarre off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call,</HI> Where
an effectual call cannot be meant (which the Apostle calls a <HI>call
according to purpose</HI>) proper only to the elect, It is a call unto such
a Church-state, as the whole Nation of the Jews did then enjoy, as
the first-borne in the family; A call that puts them into a like
Church-state, and condition with the Jews. From whence this argu∣ment
may be drawn. Those to whom the Covenant of promise
appertaines have a right to Baptisme; But the covenant of pro∣mise
appertaines to men in a Church-state and condition, and to
their children. The major cannot be denied by any that will not
make themselves the Apostles opposites. The minor proposition
is now to be considered, That the covenant of promise to men in a
Church-state and condition is in that latitude as to comprize their
children. For which the words of the Apostle are full and clear,
<HI>To you is the promise made, and to your children,</HI> on which <HI>Calvin</HI>
rightly comments. <HI>Peter observes</HI> (saith he) <HI>a due order, when he
assigns the first place of honour to the Jewes, That it takes in children,
it depends on the words of the promise,</HI> Gen. 17. 7. <HI>I will be thy God,
and the God of thy seed.</HI> Where God joynes children with their
parents in the priviledge of adoption, in the inheritance of
priviledges belonging to all Church-members.</P>
<P>But this clear text wants not wits that study to cloud it; <MILESTONE UNIT="Objections answered."/> Some
except against the word <HI>[children,]</HI> and will have them to be the
same as the <HI>sons and daughters</HI> mentioned, <HI>v.</HI> 17. of that chapter,
from <HI>Joel, chap.</HI> 2. 28. and consequently the promise to be meant of
the Spirit of prophecie, and to appertaine to none but those of age
and capacity for prophecie. To this I answer, 1. The extraordinary
gifts of the holy Ghost in this visible way cannot be the promise
here by Saint <HI>Peter</HI> mentioned, seeing it is enlarged <HI>to all that are
afarre off, even to as many as the Lord shall call.</HI> But all these
have not the holy Ghost in that way extraordinary, nor any pro∣mise
of it; Baptisme with the holy Ghost and with fire, is a
<PB N="320" REF="178"/>
baptisme proper to those primitive Saints, wherewith they were
told that they should be baptized not many dayes after▪ 2 How∣soever
the promise be interpreted so, as to belong to all that are
beleevers, and call on the name of the Lord, as there followes,
yet that promise is on condition of their baptisme; The meanes
are to be used in reference to the end, Baptisme is the meanes,
receiving of the holy Ghost (there specified) is the end; And
the Apostle confirming them in the promise of the end, doth
likewise encourage them to the use of the meanes, in Baptisme to
expect the gift of the Spirit, and so (according to this interpre∣tation)
that place is an encouragement to baptisme. The
promise is the fittest encouragement to the Signe and Seale of the
promise. Baptisme is the Signe and Seale to which they are here
encouraged, and in that latitude as they had formerly known the
command of Circumcision. 3. Neither are the children here menti∣oned
the same with sonnes and daughters spoken of by the Pro∣phet,
nor limitted to such sonnes and daughters as are of growth,
and capable of the gift of prophesie. 1. The Apostle urgeth the
promise in the way, as in the Scripture it is delivered, which is to
men and their posterity, to them and theirs. So God promises
to be a God in covenant to his and their seed, and this the Apostle
holds out, to draw them on to the Seale of the covenant to ac∣cept
Baptisme on the same terms that <HI>Abraham</HI> did circumcision.
2. It is without reason to beleeve that the Apostle should instance
in one peece of the distribution of the Prophet there, and to leave
out the rest; to put in alone sons and daughters, when we have
in the Text young men, old men, servants and handmaids. 3. Chil∣dren
here are mentioned under a promise to the parents, <HI>to you
and your children is the promise made,</HI> but not so in <HI>Joel,</HI> nor in the
quotation of the Apostle. That Scripture hath only an enume∣ration
of the several sorts and conditions of people in any Nation,
on all which the spirit is promised, without any reference made
to the parents of those sonnes and daughters, more then to the ma∣sters
of those servants and handmaids; not the sonnes and daugh∣ters
of their flesh, but the sonnes and daughters of the Nation. A
Language usual in our ordinary expressions speaking of men of a∣ny
sort or condition, as your Lawyers, your Merchants, &amp;c. so here,
your sonnes, your daughters, your old men, your young men, &amp;c▪
Others say, <HI>That the promise made, is the sending of Jesus Christ, and
<PB N="321" REF="178"/>
blessing by him as is expounded,</HI> Acts 3. 25, 26. Act 13. 32. Ro. 15. 39.
I answer; it is true, that Jesus Christ is the most eminent mercy pro∣mised,
and may be called the promise <HI>virtualiter,</HI> being the ground
of all promises, and therefore some interpreters have mentioned
the gift of Christ on this occasion. But it is plaine that Gods Co∣venant,
and this gift are to be distinguished; Christ is promised
in priority to the Jew, before the Gentile; The Jew then is taken
into Covenant before this gift of Christ can be of them expected:
It is therefore the Covenant it self (entered with parent and child,
root and branch) that is here meant (as <HI>Calvin</HI> in the words be∣fore
observes) from which the giving of Christ in the flesh follows.
And therefore <HI>Diodati</HI> fully pitches upon the true sense of it, <HI>See∣ing
as you are</HI> Abrahams <HI>children, you are within the Covenant, you
ought to acknowledge Christ to be the head and fountaine of the Cove∣nant
The Covenant, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed, is here
meant, which from</HI> Abraham <HI>had been the Jewes priviledge,</HI> Rom. 9.</P>
<P>It is farther said, that <HI>the limitation, as many as the Lord
our God shall call, shewes that the promise belongs to them, not
simply as Jewes, but as called of God; which is more expressely affirmed,</HI>
Acts 3. 26. <HI>To you first God having raised up his Sonne Jesus, sent
him to blesse you in turning away every one of you from his iniqui∣ties.</HI>
I wonder how it came into any mans head to call this
amplification, a limitation, it plainly enough speaks their bold∣nesse
in dealing with the Scriptures; Had the Apostle said, To
you is the promise made, and to your seed, in case God shall give
you a call, he had spoke to their purpose; but saying, <HI>To you,
and to as many as the Lord your God shall call;</HI> it plainly shewes
that he does not limit, but amplifie the mercy, extending it
not barely to the Jewes (who in present by reason of fruition
of Ordinances were a people near to the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 148. 14.) but
also to the Gentiles, who <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 17. we affare off. 2. In that
he saith, this promise belongs to them not simply as Jewes, but as
called, is a full contradiction: A Jew uncalled (at this time be∣fore
the Kingdome was taken from them) is as much as a Convert
unconverted, or a Gentile disciple undiscipled: In case they think
to come off by limitting it to an effectual call, the Scriptures by
themselves quoted, doth evidently contradict it, Christ came to
give them, that effectual calling, and not onely to those that were
thus called. It is yet said, <HI>Peter doth exhort to repentance, and
<PB N="322" REF="179"/>
Baptisme together, and in the first place perswades to repentance, then
to Baptisme, which shews repentance to be in order before baptisme.</HI>
To which I answer, that these who had crucified Christ as a blas∣phemer,
a seditious person, an impostour must needs repent be∣fore
they would accept Baptisme in his name, or hope for remissi∣on
of sinne by him, I had been lost labour for the Apostle, to have
pressed those, that had crucified Christ, and retained their former
opinion of him, to become disciples to him, and to look to be sa∣ved
by him, To perswade them to look for remission of sinnes in
his blood, who took themselves to be without sinne in shedding
of it; Yet notwithstanding this guilt (of which the Apostle would
have them to repent) he shews that they and their seed are under
the promise of God, and puts them into a way, in acceptation of
Christ in the Gospel-tender, in his present way of administration,
to be continued his people still in covenant, and that (as is plainly
enough signified) that they might enjoy it in their former latitude,
to them and to their children. The promise (of which they were
not yet dispossest, but stood as a people of God in visible Cove∣nant,
and their children) is here brought as a motive to encourage
them to hold correspondency with God (as his covenant-people)
embracing the way which their long expected, and desired Mes∣siah
had now instituted &amp; appointed. But this promise was to them
and their children. Here is yet another evasion, <HI>The text speaks
not expressely of Infants, but of children indefinitely;</HI> And if infants
be not children, we will be content that they be cast out of cove∣nant,
and will hold no more plea for their Church-membership nor
Baptisme. God in the Covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> did not
expressely mention infants, but seed, yet infants were his seed, and,
as his seed, by Gods command to be circumcised, And all our
infants are our children, and consequently to be baptized, <HI>Acts</HI>
20. 7. is an expresse Text with some of this party (without any
help of consequence) to prove that women received the Lords
Supper, <HI>Because it is said that disciples came together to break
bread,</HI> as though woman, and disciple, were <HI>synonyma?</HI> But here
the promise being made to children, infants must neither be
comprized in the letter, nor yet by any favour of consequence
included.</P>
<P><HI>It is further objected, that the text speaks not of the
children of the Gentiles at all (of whom we are) but of the children
<PB N="323" REF="179"/>
of the Jews, and therefore if that promise be extended to infants, which
doth not appear, the promise is to be expounded so, as to note something
peculiar to the Jews infants.</HI> If the Gospel held out any such transcen∣ding
priviledges appertaining to the seed of the Jews above the
Gentiles, they may do well to produce a Text for it, otherwise
we shall take it for granted from Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> that there is none at
all, that in Christ there is <HI>neither Greek nor Jew, Circumcision nor un∣circumcision,
Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free.</HI> And when
the Apostle addes, <HI>To those that are afarre off, even as many as the
Lord shall call,</HI> he plainly meanes the Gentiles, as appears, com∣paring
<HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 13. and though I take not the boldnesse to adde
to the words, as some stand charged, yet it is cleare, that he
same is understood there in reference to the children of the
Gentiles, that is exprest before to the children of the Jewes. If
any shall grant an inheritance to <HI>Titius</HI> and his heires for ever,
and to <HI>Caius,</HI> every one will understand that the heires of <HI>Caius</HI>
are meant as well as the heirs of <HI>Titius,</HI> especially if it can be
proved out of the Grant it self, that the priviledges conveyed to
<HI>Caius,</HI> are as ample, as that to <HI>Titius.</HI> We can prove the privi∣ledges
granted to the Gentiles in the Gospel to be equal to those
granted to the Jews; when the Jews children then are under the pro∣mise
with their parents, the children of beleeving Gentiles cannot
be excluded.</P>

with the call of the Gentiles, and their present Adoption,
now somewhat to allay the seeming harshnesse of that do∣ctrine
of his against the Jewes, and to take down the insultings
of the Gentiles over that people, in this chapter he speaks to both.
1. To the Jews by way of mitigation, limiting this doctrine of
their rejection with a double caution. 1. That it was not total.
2. That it was not final. That it was not total, he first asserts,
secondly proves; asserts, <HI>ver. 1. I say then, hath God cast away his peo∣ple?
God forbid.</HI> Proves by a threefold argument. 1. By instance
in himself, <HI>verse 1. For I am also an Israelite, of the seed of</HI> Abra∣ham,
<HI>of the Tribe of</HI> Benjamin, and he doth not dispute for his
own rejection. 2. By instance in the elect of God, <HI>verse 2. God
hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.</HI> 3. From a pa∣rallel
Scripture, out of 1 <HI>King.</HI> 18. which parallel he first lays down,
<HI>verse 2, 3, 4▪ W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ye not what the Scripture saith of</HI> Elias, <HI>how
he maketh intercession to God against</HI> Israel, <HI>saying Lord they have
killed thy Prophets, and digged down thy Altars, And I am left alone,
and they seek my life? But what saith the answer of God unto him?
I have reserved to my selfe seven thousand men, who have not
bowed the knee to the Image of</HI> Baal. And afterward applies, <HI>verse
5. Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant accord∣ing
to the election of grace.</HI> And so falls into a digression concern∣ing
grace and works, <HI>verse</HI> 6. to the 11. 2. He speaks to the Gen∣tiles,
and to take down their insultation over the Jewes, he shewes
that this rejection of theirs is not final. And this, as the former, is
1. Asserted, <HI>verse 11. I say then, have they stumbled that they
should fall? (viz.</HI> irrecoverably fall) <HI>God forbid.</HI> 2. Proved by
giving account of a twofold end of this rejection of the Jewes.
1. The call of the Gentile, <HI>verse 12. But rather through their fall
salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealou∣sie.</HI>
2. A more glorious returne of the Jews, in emulation of
the Gentiles, <HI>verse 12. Now if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fall of them be the riches of the
world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how

of his zeal toward them, and their re-ingraffing, <HI>vers.</HI> 13. 14, 15.
<PB N="325" REF="180"/>
adding the words of the Text, <HI>If the first fruits be holy, the lump
also is holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</HI> This <HI>Para<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣us</HI>
makes a farther Argument, for proof that the Jews shall again
be called; <HI>Gomarus</HI> makes it an encouragement to the Apostle to
endeavour their call, howsoever here is a double similitude, One
drawn from the Ceremonial Law, <HI>If the first fruits be holy, the
lump is also holy.</HI> The other from Nature, <HI>If the root be holy, so
are the branches.</HI> The first is only mentioned, the second is large∣ly
commented upon. In both we see, 1. A supposition 2. An af∣firmation.
The supposition is, of the holinesse of the first fruits,
the holinesse of the root. The affirmation is, the whole lump is
holy, the branches are holy. This last is grounded on a principle
in nature universally true. <HI>As is the root, so is the branch,</HI> they are
both of one and the same nature; As is the one, so is the other.
Which he applies to the state of the Church of God; first to the
Church of the Jewes, and that 1. In their ancient estate, when
they were a people of God, in Covenant-relation, holy, so stiled of
him frequently in Scripture. 2. In their present state, for a great
part broken off, and so made no people▪ 3. In their future con∣dition
when they should be called of God, and as it were risen
from the dead. Secondly, he applies it also to the Gentiles. 1. In
their ancient estate, as no people. 2. In their present estate, made
a people of God, in the place of the Jewes. 3. In their possible
estate, and condition, to be rejected and cast off▪ On which we may
ground several undeniable Positions, some concerning the subject,
[root and branch] some concerning the predicate [holy].<NOTE PLACE="marg">Positions pre∣mised for the right under∣standing. 1. Of the root and branch.</NOTE></P>
<P>First, concerning the subject root and branch, in this place (as by
way of Metaphor) set out the estate of parent and childe, ancestor
and issue. 2. The whole body of the Church is compared to a
tree, to an Olive tree. 3. The root of this tree (<HI>viz.</HI> the first su∣preme

alone, so Ishmaelites would be of the body. Nor <HI>Abraham</HI> with <HI>I∣saac</HI>

But the Apostle in this chapter (from Old Testament-authority)
excludes both of them, <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> are therefore

<PB N="326" REF="181"/>
Gentiles are branches by <HI>insition</HI> put into the stock, the natural
branches being broken off. 5. The fatnesse of this tree is the
glory of Ordinances, of which the whole Church partakes, or as
some say, Christ is the fatnesse, but that is onely as he is tendered
in Ordinances, for he walks in the middest of the Golden Can∣dlesticks.
In which sense onely we may yeeld that Christ is that
fatnesse.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Of the holi∣nesse here mentioned.</NOTE> concerning the predicate, <HI>Holy.</HI> There is one and
the same holinesse goes through the whole tree, all the branches
natural and engraffed through the whole Church, and all the
children of it Jews and Gentiles; The whole of this holinesse is
from one Original root, and therefore one and the same. 2. This
holinesse is such as is communicable from parent to childe, and
necessarily communicated, as a root communicates sap to the
branches. This is so plaine, that if it be denied, all the Apostles dis∣pute
falls. 3. It is no holinesse of inhesion, but relation, not qua∣litative,
but federal. The holinesse of the Jewes who were a holy
Nation was such; The holinesse of the Gentiles can be no other.
Holinesse of inhesion is not communicable, but only holinesse of
relation. In holinesse of inhesion the proposition holds not▪ as,
is the father, so, is the child, who knowes not that holy fathers
have unholy children? regenerate parents have issue unrege∣nerate.</P>
<P>These things considered, it is evident, that, as the father is in re∣gard
of Church-state, Covenant-holinesse, so is the childe, both in
the Church of the Jews and Gentiles: The father being without,
the childe is without; the father being within, the childe is with∣in,
<HI>eo nomine,</HI> because a branch of such a root, a childe of such a
father, which is a full confirmation of the point in hand, that
the childe is in Covenant with the father, and the person that
actually enters Covenant, is not solely vested in it. One stands
upon the contrary part, and puts it to this issue for trial, <HI>Whe∣ther
this ingraffing be into the visible Church by profession of Faith, or
into the invisible by Election and Faith;</HI> and concludes, <HI>that it is
meant of the Church invisible;</HI> which if he can make good, I shall
confesse all Arguments drawn from hence (as to this point) are lost;
I would (to avoid impertinent cavils, and quarrels) each Text were
brought to such issue. I shall in the first place bring arguments
to evince that the breaking off, and engraffing, is respective to
<PB N="327" REF="181"/>
the Church, as visible, and then proceed to answer arguments
from a late hand against it.</P>
<P>1. That ingraffing which is into <HI>Abraham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments e∣vincing the in∣graffing to be into the Church only as visible, and the break∣ing oft to be frō the Church as visible.</NOTE> <HI>Isa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> as
a root is not an invisible graffing by saving Faith and Election▪
This is plaine, we live not by power received from <HI>Abraham,
Abraham</HI> cannot say he bears us up, in saving graces, and that
without sap from him, we can do nothing, But the ingraffing is
into <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> as a root. This argument as
is said by one, were of force if <HI>Abraham</HI> were made a root by
communication, and for prevention he is put to it to tell us of
a root communicating nothing, but an exemplary root, or an
exemplary cause of beleeving only; what an exemplary non-communicating
root is or meanes, let the Reader Con∣sider.</P>
<P>Secondly, that ingraffing which caused disputation and conten∣tion
in some, emulation in others upon the sight and report of it,
was not by saving faith only into the invisible body, but open, vi∣sible,
and apparant into the visible body; But this ingraffing of
the Gentiles into the Church of God, caused disputation and
contention in some, <HI>Acts</HI> 11. 2, 3. emulation in others, <HI>Deut.
32▪ 21. Rom 10. 19. Rom.</HI> 11. 14. this therefore was into the Church
visible.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That priviledge which is not restrained to some few in∣visible
Churches, but is the priviledge of all that are contained in
it, and members of it, is not an invisible work upon the heart to
a saving change, but only an interest in visible priviledges. This
is evident, the invisible work is not in all, <HI>Matth. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 14. But this,
here mentioned is the priviledge of the whole body, as is cleare in
the Text, and adversaries are constrained to acknowledge;
Therefore the ingraffing is only into the visible body. That privi∣ledge
wherein the Jewes while they were a people of God did
transcend the Gentiles when they were no people, is the priviledge
which these Gentiles have by their ingraffing, this is plain, <HI>verse
17▪</HI> But it is the priviledge of Ordinances in being visibly related
thus to God wherein Jews did then exceed Gentiles, as hath been
largely shewn.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that Faith from which the Jews actually fell▪ and
the Gentiles stood in danger to fall from, is not a saving justifying
Faith, entituling to invisible priviledges, but a Faith of profession
<PB N="328" REF="182"/>
onely giving a visible title. This is plaine, unlesse we will main∣taine
<HI>Bertius</HI> his <HI>Hymenem desertur,</HI> and assert the Apostasie of
the Saints. But this Faith whereby the Gentiles are ingraffed, is a
Faith from which the Jews fell, and from which they were in dan∣ger
to fall, <HI>v.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>Fifthly, that reconciliation or ingraffing, which is opposite to
casting out of a visible Church-state, is an ingraffing into the
Church visible; But this reconciliation or ingraffing is opposite to
the casting out of a Church state: This is plain, <HI>Matth.</HI> 21. 43. It
is a casting out of them that bore not fruit, and not a casting off in∣visible
branches.</P>
<P>Sixthly, If the state of the Jewes continued from the Apostles
time to this day, be an exclusion from a visible Church-state,
so that they are no people of God in name, then a visible Church-state
is that which they lost and the Gentiles gained; This is
plaine. The state in which they stand being rejected, is their
state of rejection; But their condition since that time, is an ex∣clusion
out of a visible Church state. This needs no proof: There∣fore
a visible Church state is that which the Jews lost, and these
gained. I wish that these arguments to which many more might
be added, may be taken into consideration, and for a close of all,
seeing it is peremptorily asserted that it is manifestly false, <HI>that
the Christian Gentiles were graffed into the same visible Church
with the Jews, for then they should have been Circumcised contrary
to the determination,</HI> Acts 15. and <HI>that God hath quite taken away
the visible Church of the Jews,</HI> or to that purpose. This Error be∣getting
many others, I wish that it may be a little better thought
upon, whether it be the language of the Scriptures. I have learnt,
that as we and they, have one and the same God; one and
the same Faith; that is, the doctrine of Faith, one and
the same Covenant, eat of one and the same spiritual
meat, and drink of the same spiritual drink, one and the same
expected heaven; so, we are one and the same Church Let us to that
end further observe the manifold <HI>Metaphors</HI> by which the Church,
ours, and theirs, is set forth, all of them holding forth this
Onenesse.</P>
<P>First, That of a <HI>Tent</HI> which is the habitation of sojourners,
<HI>Gen. 9. 27. God shall enlarge</HI> Japhet, <HI>and he shall dwell in the Tents
of</HI> Shem, <HI>and</HI> Canaan <HI>shall be his servant. Shems</HI> Tents must be
<PB N="329" REF="182"/>
possest by <HI>Japhet,</HI> and not others built for their habitation,
The Tents of <HI>Shem,</HI> that is, his posterity by <HI>Abraham</HI> (which <HI>Ja∣phet,</HI>
that is, the Gentiles by a special blessing did possesse) is the
Church visible, as needs no proof; <HI>Shems</HI> Tents, and <HI>Japhets</HI> Tents
are one, and the same, <HI>Japhet</HI> comes to <HI>Shems,</HI> not <HI>Shem</HI> to
<HI>Japhets.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That of a <HI>Sheep-fold,</HI> John 10. 16. <HI>Other sheep I
have which are not of this fold, them also I must bring, and they shall
hear my voice, and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd,</HI> The Sheep
that in present were in the fold, <HI>viz.</HI> Jews, and those not yet taken
in, <HI>viz.</HI> Gentiles, all make up one and the same fold; which
though some may limit to the Church invisible, because Christ
gives notes of those that are indeed his sheep. but that is no ar∣gument
at all; Christ speaks to those that were disciples
only according to profession, and gives notes, of disciples indeed;
and it is against all reason that Christ should in discourse point
out the invisible Church with the demonstrative <HI>This,</HI> and that to
those that were malignant enough in the Church visible, namely
the Pharisees, as appears in the close of the former Chapter▪ And
the mention of <HI>thieves creeping into it, hirelings employed in it</HI>
doth contradict it. The visible Church of the Jews and Gen
tiles, in which Christ hath true sheep for whom he dies, and
others that theeues and hirelings do deceive, makes up one sheep∣fold.</P>
<P>Thirdly, By a <HI>natural body,</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 13. Mans body most aptly
to this purpose, that one <HI>new man,</HI> Eph. 2. 15. is the visibly body
compact of both Jew and Gentile.</P>
<P>Fourthly, to adde no more, that of a Kingdome, <HI>Mat. 8. 11.
Many shall come from the East and West, and shall sit down with</HI> A∣braham,
Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> The same King∣dome
that Jews leave, Gentiles enter, <HI>Matth. 21. 41, 43. The
Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bring∣ing
forth the fruits thereof.</HI> That can be no more then the presence
of God in Gospel-Ordinances, which is without fruit among
Jewes (all invisible Members bring forth fruit) and upon that
accout is given to the Gentiles; Neither is it of force that which is
said against it, <HI>Then we must be circumcised.</HI> As though we may
not be in the same Kingdom, and yet under a new way of Admi∣nistration,
Law-givers on earth, are sometimes pleased to
<PB N="330" REF="183"/>
change their Lawes; and so doth the Law-giver of Heaven; or
if he will limit his instance to Circumcision, taking in no other
Lawes, the same house may have a new doore or porch; let
our opposites then know that they are in the same visible King∣dom,
as <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> and their posterity after the
flesh in <HI>Israel</HI> were, and I wish that they may take heed of making
divisions in it or separations from it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arguments from a late hand for ingraffing into the Church
invisible, and breaking off from it, answered.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>Argument. 1.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FIrst,</HI> That ingraffing which is Gods act by his sole power, is in∣to
the invisible Church by Election and giving Faith. For graffing
into the visible Church, is admission into visible Membership, which
if it be by an outward Ordinance, is the easie act of the Administrator;
if by profession of Faith, the easie act of the Professor. But the in∣graffing
meant, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om.</HI> 11. is Gods act from his sole power, as is
proved from <HI>verse</HI> 23. where the reason is rendred why the Jewes
should be again graffed in, is because God is able to graffe them in again,
<HI>Ergo</HI> the graffing here is into the visible Church.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This ingraffing is by a power of God, working the
heart to a professed subjection to the way of God in Ordinances
tendered, and assent of heart unto all that is there promised; that
power that brought <HI>Japhet</HI> into the tents of <HI>Shem,</HI> Gen. 9▪ 27.
That hand of the Lord that was with those that preached the
word, <HI>Act.</HI> 11. 21. so that a great number beleeved and turned to
to the Lord, must bring the Jews back into their former Church-condition.
How easie soever you take this work to be, to bring a
people who are strangers to God into a Church-state; yet our
Brethren in <HI>New England</HI> have not found it awork so easie to
bring the Natives there into a Church-condition; nor is it so
easie a businesse to bring in the Jewes to this posture of a visible
Church-state. Have so many prayers been▪ laid out for this
<PB N="331" REF="183"/>
work, and it is yet not done? when it is a matter of such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase with
man, and no need of the power of God for the doing
of it.</P>
<P>We understand a discipling of Gentile-Nations, and acknow∣ledge
it a work, above the power of man, and confesse it solely
to be in the hand of God. We do not speak of the bare admissi∣on
of men that stand entitled, but the working of them to such
a title, and if an outward profession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the power of mans
will, yet to bring men, or Nations to such a profession, cordially
to imbrace the Gospel; so far as to assent to the truth of it▪ i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above
man, and a work of no such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>Argument. 2.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That ingraffing which is called reconciliation, opposite
to casting away, that is by Election and giving Faith▪ for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
acts can reconcile; But the ingraffing here is called reconciliation▪
opposite to casting away, <HI>verse</HI> 15. as may appear in that, <HI>verse</HI> 16.
is a reason of the clause about the reception of the Jews, <HI>vers.</HI> 15. and
the 17. <HI>verse▪</HI> is an admonition from the suspition, <HI>verse▪</HI> 15. that
the Jews were cast away, which is called breaking off, <HI>v.</HI> 17. Now
if breaking off▪ <HI>verse▪</HI> 17. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the same with casting away, <HI>verse▪</HI> 15.
then ingraffing is the same with reconciliation; <HI>Ergo</HI> ingraffing is
by Election and giving of Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Reconciliation is either gradu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, or total, Either to take
in, or hold a people in visible communion, or else to receive them
with an ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asting delight in them. The former of these <HI>Moses</HI>
obtained for the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> when the Lord upon the sinne
of the golden Calfe, said; <HI>Let me alone, that my wrath may wax
hot against them,</HI> Exod 32. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. This being premi∣sed,
if any were at fault for a full answer, he might easily finde
it in the objection it selfe. Reconciliation is opposite to casting
away. The Jewes then by reconcilation are brought into that
state, out of which they were once cast; But they were not cast
out of the Church invisible; not out of Election and justification,
but out of a visible Church-state and fellowship. Breaking off,
is rightly said to be the same as casting away, and reconcilia∣tion
the same, as ingraffing. Their reconciliation, or ingraf∣fing
is, then, into that condition, from which they were broken
out of which they were cast: Now they were cast out of the
<PB N="332" REF="184"/>
Church visible, not out of the Church invisible, Their reconcili∣ation
brings them into the same Church state, which is a reconci∣liation
gradual, not total.</P>
<P><HI>It is here said,</HI> When any shall shew either a Scripture, wherein
by reconciliation to God, is meant bare vouchsafing a visible Church-state;
and by casting away, and breaking off, a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse of visible privi∣ledges,
or any approved Writer in the Churches of the Protestants so
expounding it, I shall begin to suspect that I am mistaken, but till
then, I shall remaine confident I am in the right, and shall wonder
that any that love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to wrangle, but feares to pervert the Scripture
and the truth of God, should dare so to interpret it. <HI>Here I may have
many things to say.</HI></P>
<P>1. When this Authour pleases he can heap up phrases which
are onely once used in a select sense in Scripture, and that to up∣hold
this interpretation of holy and unclean, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 14. when the
context clearly evinces the contrary.</P>
<P>2. When he pleases, he dare undertake the defence of
an opinion held unanimously by all Papists, and as unani∣mously
opposed by Protestants, as in that of Covenant-ho∣linesse.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Gomarus,</HI> Tom. 1. p. 111. observes, that <HI>World</HI> is taken in that
sense in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 12, 15. as in no other Scripture.</P>
<P>4. If reconciliation in no other place be so used, yet little is gain∣ed;
seeing as we have seen, there are parallel phrases that hold
out the same thing to us.</P>
<P>5. I shall gratifie him with an Authour, an approved Writer
in the Protestant Church, that so interprets this text in hand,
that by reconciliation to God is meant no more then vouchsafing
a visible Church-state. It is <HI>Ravanellus</HI> who having in his labo∣rious
work, <HI>Thesaurus Scripturae</HI> distinguished of a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Reconcilia∣tio est duplex 1. Hominis cum Deo. 2. Hominis cum proximo.

reconciliation. 1. Of man with God. 2. Of man with his neighbour.</HI> And defining reconciliation according to our Authours sense
<PB N="333" REF="184"/>
of it, he goes on and saith; <HI>Where we are to consider. First, the
name which</HI> (saith he) <HI>is taken either properly in the sense already
spoken to, or lesse properly,</HI> Rom. 11. 15. <HI>Where by reconciliation of
the world to God, is understood the conversion of the Gentiles to the
faith of Christ, or they are call to the participation of the favour of God,
which also is called the salvation of the Gentiles,</HI> verse 11. <HI>and the
riches of the world,</HI> verse 12. Here he may see [Faith] taken for
a bare dogmatical Faith reaching a visible Church-state and
not justifying; [Reconciliation to God] taken for the grace and
favour of Church-priviledges, And the [salvation of the Gentiles]
and [riches of the world] interpreted to signifie the same thing.
These phrases are <HI>Synonima,</HI> and they signifie a reconciliation
not properly so called; but such a one that is opposed to the
Reconciliation for which he contends. And for the other
phrase, that by casting away, and breaking off, is
meant a losse of visible priviledges, let him consult the last An∣notations
to those words, <HI>verse 22. Otherwise thou also shalt be
cut off,</HI> which they enterpret, <HI>as an unfruitful branch,</HI> adding
this caution, as though they had foreseene this Glosse, <HI>But
here it is to be noted, that this passage ought to be understood of
the outward incorporation into the Church by profession, whereof many
hypocrites do partake, and not of the inward and efficacious ingraffing
into the mystical body of Christ by a lively Faith, and the communion
of the Spirit according to the election of God, which is ever accompa∣nied
with perseverance.</HI> Doctor <HI>Featly</HI> in his <HI>Pelagius redivivus</HI>
hath these words which being so pertinent, I shall transcribe, Se∣cond
parallel, <HI>p. 38. To the place alledged,</HI> Rom. 11. 19, 20. <HI>We An∣swer</HI>
(saith he)▪</P>
<P><Q>First, that it is not meant of particular Beleevers, and their
danger of falling away from justifying Faith; but of the people
of the Gentiles in general, and their danger of being cut off
from the true Olive into which they were ingraffed, that is,
from the outward profession of Faith, and communion of the
Catholick Church into whith they were admitted upon the re∣jection
of the Jewes. The Gentiles therefore ought not to be
high-minded against the Jewes, but fear; lest God who spared
not the natural branches, should not spare them but cut them off
also as he did the natural branches, if they should grow proud,
and presumptuously secure. Now there is no question but that
<PB N="334" REF="185"/>
a visible Church, which at this time professeth the truth, and
is a Member of the Catholick Church, may fall away from the
outward and publick profession of faith, and cease to be a part
of the Catholick visible Church, as the most famous and
sometimes flourishing Church in <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> planted by
the Apostles themselves; (now over-runne with Mahometa∣nisme,
Idolatry, and Heresie) prove by their lamentable A∣postasie,
deplorable, if not desperate estate. But <HI>Bertius,</HI> and
the Appealer should have their eyes upon the mark, and
point in question, which is not in the doctrine of Faith, but of
the habit of faith; not <HI>de fide quam credimus,</HI> but <HI>de fide quâ cre∣dimus,</HI>
not of the publick profession of a Church, but of a parti∣cular
affiance of every true beleever in Christ. A Member of
the visible Church may be cut off, but no Member of the invi∣sible,
for Christ cannot have <HI>damn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta membra,</HI> any Members
who shall not be saved, as the approver of the Appealers book,
rightly gathereth out of Saint <HI>Austine</HI> in his reply to <HI>Fisher.</HI> A
Church or Kingdome generally may depart from the Christian
Faith, or renounce the pure profession thereof in publick, and
yet no true Beleever either totally or finally lose his Faith; but
either secretly in that state or Kingdome, or else-where open∣ly
he may retaine both Faith it self and the profession thereof.

speech concerning particular men, but of the whole company

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The ingraffing must be meant of that act whereby the
branch stands in the tree, as a branch; this will none deny, it being the

Doctrine of Faith, this objector of the habit. The Apostle speaks
<HI>de fide quam credimus,</HI> this objector speaks <HI>de fide qua credimus.</HI>
The Apostle speaks of the publick profession of a Church, He
of a particular affiance of every Beleever in Christ. He addes,
<HI>This conceit I conceived, and still think is so farre from the Apostles
expressions, that there seemes to be no shew of such a sense in the
words;</HI> giving in his reason, <HI>For there is not a word of taking
into the Olive, but by Faith,</HI> verse 19, 20. There is indeed here
no shew of reason unlesse it can be affirmed, that there is no
<PB N="336" REF="186"/>
faith, but the Faith of the Elect, and that which is justifying;
therefore if it please the Authour, I shall enter the lists with him
in these three <HI>Positions.</HI></P>
<P>1. That Faith is taken in more acceptions then one in Scri∣pture;
All Faith doth not entitle to the Church invisible, and
therefore there is scarce shew of sense in his reason, disputing from
the <HI>Genus</HI> to the <HI>Species affirmativè,</HI> or from the <HI>Analogum</HI> to
the <HI>Analogatum.</HI></P>
<P>2. That the Faith here spoken to, is (as Doctor <HI>Featly</HI> as∣serts)
the doctrine of Faith, not the habit; Faith of Profession,
and not a particular affiance; <HI>fides quam,</HI> and not <HI>fides qua cre∣dimus,</HI>
and so the fallacy is clear; and it will no more follow that
the ingraffing is into the Church invisible, because it is by faith;
then it will follow that because bruits have souls that therefore
they have reasonable souls.</P>
<P>3. That there is no such thing in all Scripture as ingraffing into
the Church inuisible by Faith; All ingraffing is into the body
visible, and therefore by a faith of profession. (1.) All ingraf∣fing
is into that subject, which immediately receives what is in∣graffed,
as the stock receives the syens; but it is Christ, and not
the Church invisible that receives the Elect Beleever; <HI>Christ
dwells in us by Faith,</HI> so we in Christ, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3. 17. (2.) All in∣graffing
is into that which gives sap and juice to the ingraffed, as
the stock from the root to the syens; Now Christ gives sap to
the Elect beleeving, not the Church, and therefore it is not into
the Church, but into Christ. (3.) If saving faith ingraffe the
branch into the Church invisible, then the Church invisible is
the proper object of such Faith; but the Church is no such ob∣ject
of Faith but Christ. (4.) That supposed ingraffing into
the invisible Church, is either known to the body invisible, or un∣witting;
if know, then it is no invisible. They have no light to
discerne an invisible work; if unknown, then there could not
be such a dispute about the new▪ ingraffing of Gentiles, nor
complaint of breaking off of the Jewes, all being done by an in∣visible
translation, and so the subject of the question is taken
away. To dispute whether ingraffing into the Church, be into
the Church-visible, or invisible; is to dispute whether the Mount
of Olives be a Mountaine of Earth, or Aire. I shall assoon finde
a Mountaine of Aire in <HI>Geography,</HI> as this ingraffing into the
<PB N="337" REF="186"/>
invisible Church in Divinity: And here I tie not any up to the
word (which I conceive in reference to any Ecclesiastical or Spi∣ritual
station, is not elsewhere used in Scripture) but to the thing.
All that accesse to the Church from Gentile Nations, which is
so large fore-prophesied in the Old Testament, and Historically
related in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> was an ingraffing into the
Church visible, and this ingraffing here mentioned. The visible
Church did immediately receive these new branches, and so the
whole body of Jews and Gentiles professedly beleeving, <HI>Ephes.</HI>
2. 15. became one new man. The visible Church communicates
sap and juice (which is the fatnesse of the Olive) in Ordinan∣ces.
This is known by the Church visible, they were sensible of, and
full of praises, for the new addition to this number.</P>

that every beleeving parent is the <HI>root;</HI> I willingly yeeld that
every beleeving parent is not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the root, but I affirm
that every beleeving parent is a root, I cannot reach this my∣stery,
that <HI>Abraham</HI> can be a root of all the branches in <HI>Israel,</HI>
reaching down to the Apostles times, no intermediate rootes
intervening, no more then <HI>Adam</HI> can be a natural root of
mankinde to this time, without intermediate fathers of
our flesh, deriving us from him, as <HI>Jacob</HI> with <HI>Rachel</HI> and <HI>Leah</HI>
was a root from whom <HI>Israel</HI> sprang as branches of an Olive;
so <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Tamar, Boaz,</HI> and <HI>Ruth</HI> were roots likewise: <HI>They
built up the house of</HI> Israel, <HI>Ruth.</HI> 4. 11, 12. The house of <HI>Israel</HI>
was this Olive-tree, these several Metaphors expressing the same
thing, the building of the house, and bringing out the branches
are one and the same. All builders are roots; these are builders
therefore roots; <HI>Abraham</HI> may be called the builder laying the
first foundation, so the root from whence every branch was de∣rived;
yet every particular Beleever that had issue, a
builder, a root. Those Israelites that had no holinesse of inhesion,
<PB N="338" REF="187"/>
but only of relation that were members of the Church visible,
not invisible, were fathers by way of communication of this ho∣linesse,
1 <HI>Cor. 10. 1. All our fathers were under the cloud, and all
passed through the sea.</HI> It is as necessary to have intermediate fa∣thers
between us and <HI>Abraham,</HI> as to have intermediate mothers
between us and <HI>Eue. Eve</HI> may as well be the mother of all living,
and no other mother between us and her, as <HI>Abraham</HI> can be
the father of the Faithful, and no intermediate father to derive
from him, and communicate to us. But his proof is very well
worth the hearing, that every beleeving parent is not the root.
<HI>For then all the branches should be natural; the childe of every belee∣ving
Parent is a natural branch from his father. But here Apostle
makes the Gentiles branches, and a wild Olive graffed in besides
nature, and the Jews only natural branches growing from the root,</HI>
verse 21, 24. The Apostle makes them wilde onely at their first
ingraffing, and so was all <HI>Terahs</HI> race wilde likewise, till that
change of Faith wrought in <HI>Abrahams</HI> call, and the covenant
of God entered with him; We now are natural as they were, and
cannot be called wilde, but in our first Original. <HI>Positively,</HI> (he
sayes) <HI>the root is no other then</HI> Abraham, <HI>that</HI> Abraham <HI>onely is a
holy root, or at most</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob. If this have any
face of Argument, it runnes thus. <HI>If</HI> Abraham <HI>be the root, and
not every beleeving Parent, then the ingraffing is by Election, and
Faith that justifies.</HI> The truth is, the sequel is undeniable on the
contrary; If <HI>Abraham</HI> be the root, then the ingraffing is not
into the invisible Church, (which he strangely calls by Election)
but onely into the visible. This Master <HI>Blakwood</HI> saw, and faine
would have maintained that Christ is the root; for ingraffing
into Christ, and not into <HI>Abraham,</HI> makes a member of the
Church invisible. If the ingraffing be by a saving Faith only, to
derive saving Graces personally inherent, as a fruit of Election
from <HI>Abraham,</HI> then it must needs be that we are Elect in <HI>A∣braham.
Abraham</HI> may say, Without me ye can do nothing, and
he that beleeveth in me, out of his belly shall flow forth rivers of
living water; and we may say, The life that we live in the flesh
we live by faith in the sonne of <HI>Terah.</HI> This must necessarily
follow, if <HI>Abraham</HI> be the root, not only respective to a condi∣tional
Covenant, but to the grace under condition covenanted;
It had been more safe for our Authour with Master <HI>Blackwood</HI>
<PB N="339" REF="187"/>
(though in contradiction to himself) to have made Christ the
root; when these consequences must follow; To which he an∣swers,</P>
<P><HI>If I made</HI> Abraham <HI>a root as communicating Faith by infusion;
or impetration mediatory as Christ, this would follow; But I make</HI>
Abraham <HI>a root, as he is called the father of all them that beleeve,</HI>
Rom. 4. 11. <HI>Not by begetting Faith in them, but as an exempl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry
cause of beleeving as I gather from the expression,</HI> verse 12. <HI>That
he is a father to them that walk in the steps of our father</HI> Abraham,
<HI>which he had yet being uncircumcised,</HI> A root not by communica∣tion,
but example, an ingraffing, not to have any thing commu∣nicated
from the root, but to imitate it, is such a <HI>Catacresis</HI> as
may well make all Rhetorick ashamed of it; and if the Sun ever
saw a more notable piece of non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sense, I am to seek what sense
is. A root is too low in the earth, to have its examples followed,
and syens suck in juice, but know not how to imitate. And
what kinde of root soever any can make it; the root mention∣ed
by the Apostle in that Chapter, is a root by communication,
<HI>verse. 17. If some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a
wilde Olive-tree wert graffed amongst them, and with them parta∣kest
of the root and fatnesse of the Olive-tree.</HI> The root here com∣municates
fatnesse to the branches, and the branches receive
from the root. It is then a communicative root, and doth
communicate that which makes the branch one with it. <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
is indeed called a father, as well as he is called a root,
but these two are not full <HI>Synonima</HI>'s, though in the maine
they agree, both Metaphors aptly setting forth, what the
branches, as from a root, the children, as from a father, re∣ceive,
namely their title to the Covenant from him; and there∣fore,
as to <HI>Abraham,</HI> so, to all <HI>Israel</HI> appertained the Cove∣nants
and the Adoption, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4, 5. And so to all those that
are become children and branches with them. The title fa∣ther
is yet extended to a greater latitude, as he doth impart
to his issue, (as before) so he is a patterne and example, as even
natural parents are likewise, according as <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 12. it is set

<HEAD>Argument 5.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fifthly, From</HI> verse 25. If the breaking off the Jews be by blinding;
<HI>then</HI> the ingraffing is by giving Faith, but the former is true, <HI>ver. 25.
Ergo</HI> the latter.</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Here as in the third Argument, I grant the conclusion,
and return the same answer. Jewish blindnesse keeps them out
of a Church-state, and so from all Faith in the Covenant; and
when the vaile shall be taken away, they shall be reinvested in a
Church-state and Covenant-condition. For proof there is ad∣ded,</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> blinding or hardening is, <HI>verse</HI> 7. opposed to that
state which the Election obtained, by which, <HI>ver.</HI> 8. they had a spi∣rit
of slumber, eyes that they should not see, eares that they should not
hear, <HI>verse</HI> 10. Whereby their eyes were darkened that they might
not see, from which Anti-Arminians gather absolute reprobation,
<HI>Ames animad. in Remon. Script. Synod. Art. 1. Cap.</HI> 16. Hoc
ipsum ad reprobationem spectare Apostolus <HI>Paulus</HI> clarè ostendit,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 17. Now according to the rule of opposites, <HI>Opposito∣rum
opposita sunt attributa;</HI> If the blinding be the effect of repro∣bation,
and the breaking off be by blinding, then the ingraffing is by
inlightening, and that enlightening is according to Election, and so is all
one with giving of Faith.</P>
<P>The proposition being; If the blinding be the effect of re∣probation,
and the breaking off is by blinding, then the in∣graffing
is by enlightening, and that according to Election, then
the assumption can be no other, but that blindnesse is the effect
of reprobation, and the breaking off is by blinding. No one
of the <HI>Contra-Remonstrants</HI> worthy the name of an adversary of
Arminians, hath taught this doctrine: It that which their
adversaries indeed charge upon them, but that which they una∣nimously
do disclaime. I have heard that reprobation is the an∣tecedent
of sinne, but never that it was the cause; and that sinne
is a consequent of it, but never an effect. Reprobation is the Act
of God, and in case it be the cause of blindnesse, then God is
the cause of blindnesse; so that the <HI>Contra-remonstrants</HI> have
got a sweet Advocate to cast that upon them, that none of their
adversaries (though they have turned every stone to do it) could
never proue by them. And the other member, that casting a∣way
<PB N="341" REF="188"/>
way is by blinding, is little better. The Apostle speaks in ano∣ther
manner; Blindnesse was their guilt, and casting off was
their just sentence; <HI>Because of unbelief they were broken off,</HI>
verse 20. upon this account God <HI>God did not spare them,</HI> as it
follows in the next <HI>verse.</HI> The work, and the wages, the
guilt, and the punishment are not one: Unbelief and break∣ing
off, are the work and the wages, the guilt and the punish∣ment:
Breaking off then, as not blinding. The Apostle
layes all at mans doore, makes his blindnesse the moving cause,
according to that of the Prophet; <HI>Thy destruction is of thy self,</HI>
and God only the severe, but just Judge. Our Authour layes
all upon God, Gods reprobation causes blindnesse, and their
breaking off is by blinding; here is no hand but Gods, in their
destruction. And now the blasphemy of the consequence being
denied, so that blindnesse is no effect of reprobation, breaking
off being not by blinding; what becomes of the rule of op∣posites
here produced? Election and reprobation in the work
of salvation and damnation, do not <HI>per omnia quadrare,</HI> other∣wise
as Election leads to salvation without any merit of works,
so Reprobation should lead to destruction without any merit of
sinne, which <HI>Contra-remonstrants</HI> unanimously deny, though
we finde it here affirmed. It is further said, that from <HI>verse</HI>
8. 10. of this Chapter. <HI>Anti-Arminians gather absolute
Reprobation,</HI> and then explaining what this absolute Reprobation
is, in the words spoken to. But though much be spoke of the
irrespective decree both between us and Arminians, and also
among our selves: yet I would faine learne what one Anti-Arminian
ever made Reprobation absolute in this sense; <HI>Ame∣sius</HI>

in God, much more may it be determined from that grace which is
proper. Ravanellus <HI>in</HI> verbum Electio, <HI>understands Election in</HI> v. 28.
<HI>of common Election, as he do also in</HI> 1. Pet. 2. 9. Amesius▪ <HI>is urged
as an adversary yet appears otherwise. The Remonstrants giving

truth, and to abuse it for the overthrow or removal of another;
<HI>So that it appears according to him, that they spake truth in the
denial of this to be meant of the unchangable decree of eternal E∣lection;
but they abuse this truth in about to avoid the argument
drawn from it, for perseverance. As Jesuites and Arminians do ob∣ject
it, so their adversaries freely confesse it. I have indeed
sometimes in my thoughts doubted, how fitly this Text was
brought against Arminians for proof of perseverance and esta∣ment
of assurance, yet satisfied my selfe according to what
hath been said; but (since I had any understanding) never
questioned but it was here applied (according to the minde of these
Authours) to the National priviledge of the Jews, the full scope
of these Chapters being to dispute the rejection of</HI> Israel <HI>after the
flesh, their former dignity, and consequently their future recovery
unto the state from whence they were fallen, in which the Gentile-Nations
by discipling do succed: let us go no farther for deter∣mination
of the question, then the preceding</HI> verse, As concern∣ing
the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the
Election they are beloved for the Fathers sake. <HI>Here is to be en∣quired.
1. Who were enemies concerning the Gospel. 2. Who
the Fathers are, for whose sake they are beloved. 3. What
this election is, and then we shall soone see who are beloved
<PB N="346" REF="191"/>
for the Fathers sake. For the first, It is not the spiritual
seed that were as concerning the Gospel enemies, that is the
highest of contradictions; but, as</HI> Diodate <HI>sayes,</HI> the Jewes who
at present time were alienate from God by reason of rebellion a∣gainst
the Gospel, which only can unite souls to him. <HI>Enemies a∣gainst
the Gospel, are enemies against God, which cannot be un∣derstood
of spiritual Israel. The fathers for whose sake they are
beloved, are the ancient fathers, from whom after the flesh they
did proceed, especially</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob. <HI>The word is</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, prepter patres, for the fathers; <HI>Then Election
must needs be (as</HI> Paraeus <HI>upon the words,</HI> Diodate <HI>and</HI> Ravanellus
<HI>in</HI> verbum Electio <HI>observe) understood of an external grace of the
Covenant whereby God chose this Nation to himself, according
to that of</HI> Moses, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 6. For thou art an holy people unto the
Lord thy God; The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special
people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth;
<HI>unlesse we are elect in</HI> Abraham <HI>to salvation, and not in Christ.
And</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>are our Mediatours reconciliation;
and when the Apostle saith,</HI> We are accepted in the beloved, <HI>Ephes.
1. 6. it is to be understood of acceptation in</HI> Abraham; <HI>and we are
to conclude our prayers not in and through Christ, but</HI> Abraham,
Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob; <HI>we are not for their sakes beloved to salvation.</HI>

<HEAD>Argument. 8.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> If the ingraffing both of Jews and Gentiles be the fruit
of Gods mercy, the breaking off by shutting up in unbelief, then the
ingraffing is into the invisible Church by election and giving faith:
But the former is true, <HI>verse 30, 31, 32. Ergo</HI> the latter. Answ.
<HI>The priviledge of a Church-state, which the Jewes once had;
and againe shall have, is a mercy, as may be seene,</HI> Hosea
1. 6, 9.</P>
<P><HI>Our Author addes,</HI> What shall I say more? It is so plain from the
whole scope, and tenour of the Apostles words, that the ingraffing there
spoken of is, into the invisible Church by election and giving faith, that
from the first of the chapter, to <HI>verse</HI> 13. there is scarce a verse but
speaks of rejecting, foreknowing, election, grace, hardening, giving a
Spirit of slumber, darkening the eyes, stumbling, falling, or some equi∣pollent
terme to these; and the Apostle doth plainly signifie his inten∣tion
in all that discourse, to be the shewing the mystery of Gods counsel
in electing, reprobating, blinding, conuerting, one while the Jews, ano∣ther
while the Gentiles; so that I cannot but admire that Mr. <HI>Marshal</HI>
should interpret the ingraffing of bare admission into visible Church-membership.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. I would willingly learne what ingraffing by Election
is, I take Election to be an immanent act in God, which is termi∣nated
in himself, and not on the creature; such expressions do not
suit with so high pretendings to scholastical learning▪ as every
where may be seen in this Authour.</P>
<P>2. I would have this Argument made up by taking in the assum∣ption
which can be no other then this. <HI>But the Jewes in their fall
from Church-fellowship cannot be said to be rejected, hardened, given to
a spirit of slumber, or that their eyes are darkened, or that they have
stumbled;</HI> neither Election or Grace should have any hand in
<PB N="348" REF="192"/>
their Church-fellowship. This must be the reasoning, if there be any
shew of reason in this heap of words, and then all may well admire,
while he is in his admiration of others. I say no more, but that
he is very weak both in Divinity and Logick, that cannot pre∣sently
upon the first sight discover the weaknesse, and return a sa∣tisfying
answer to this flourish of words.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>Argument 9.</HEAD>
<P>Parallel places, <HI>as is said,</HI> must be understood of implanting in∣to
the invisible Church, <HI>as</HI> Ephes. 3. 6. 1 Cor. 12. 13. Gal. 3. 14, 26,
28, 29.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Master <HI>Hudson,</HI> page 132. hath not onely affirmed, but
proved that the Text, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 13. is meant of the Church as
visible, to whom I referre the Reader. He places his greatest
confidence in the first as he professes, and thus enlarges upon it.
<HI>Now sure the Gentiles were made fellow-heires of the same body,
and co-partakers of the promise of God in the Gospel, not by an out∣ward
Ordinance, but by giving of faith according to Election;</HI>
Ergo <HI>the ingraffing,</HI> Rom. 11. 17. <HI>parallel to it is not by an outward
Ordinance, but by giving Faith according to Election.</HI> To this I
onely say. O that this were truth: Then as the Apostle saith
of <HI>Israel</HI> at their restauration, all <HI>Israel</HI> shall be saved, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.
26. so we may say, all <HI>England</HI> in <HI>statu quo</HI> shall be saved in the
sense that he would understand salvation. Whether we be by des∣cent
<HI>Britaines, Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Normans,</HI> we are gentiles and conse∣quently
by his Divinity partakers of the Gospel, by Fatih accord∣ing
to Election, But it is too clear that this Text is meant of
Gospel-glory, in Ordinances dispensed by the Apostles Ministery,
And <HI>as to the Jewes appertained the glory and the promises,</HI> Rom.
9. 4, 5. So now the glory and promises belong to the Gentiles;
And as many Jews as fell not off, still enjoy this this glory with
the Gentiles and so both make one new man, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 15. The
visible state of the Jews was a distinct body from the Gentiles,
Now upon this glorious call they are one new man, or new body.
For the Texts, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 14, 26, 28, 29. when any shall tell me how
they are paralle, then I shall give my answer, There is an in
graffing into Christ mentioned; but none into the Church, and
so the parallels are without force, as are the Arguments. Two
<PB N="349" REF="192"/>
things lie upon him to do, and neither is done. 1. To prove that
these Scriptures speak of a Church invisible. That they are parallel
with this Scripture. He is wont to reason with his full strength a∣gainst
the force of all Arguments, <HI>à Pari</HI> and yet this argument
must carry force from the parity of Scriptures, which he only says,
and not at all proves to be parallel, nor yet shews so much as in a
word, wherein their parity consists; he well knows that by this
means their disparity might appear. There is a tenth Argument
drawn from Authorities produced, but to so little purpose that
I will not trouble the Readers patience in the recital
of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">1 Cor. 7. 14. Vindicated.</HEAD>
<P>THe next Scripture in which this extent of the Covenant is
evidenced, is 1 <HI>Cor. 7. 14. For the unbeleeving husband is
sanctified by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife is sanctified by
the husband; else were your Children uncleane, but now are they
holy.</HI> In order to a right understanding of these words, the whole
scope of the Apostl is to be taken into consideration, which appears
to be this.</P>
<P>The <HI>Corinthians</HI> converted by the Apostles Ministery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Series of the Apostles dispute opened.</NOTE> consulted
him by letters in several cases of conscience; one concerning
Marriage, a second concerning things offered to Idols, a third
concerning spiritual gifts, a fourth concerning collection for the
Saints. That of Marriage is first spoken to, and consists of divers
heads, and are all satisfied in this Chapter.</P>
<P>One, among the rest concernes Marriage-estate, between a Be∣leever
an an Infidel, a Professour of the true Faith and a Wor∣shipper
of Idols; whether such society may be continued, or must
be separated. That this was their Quaere, appears by the Apo∣stles
resolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Corinthi∣ans</HI> Quaere.</NOTE> He gives in his answer in the affirmative, both in
the case of a beleeving husband joyned to an unbelieving wife,
and a beleeving wife joyned to an unbeleeving husband, <HI>let him
not put her away, let her not leave him,</HI> only excepting the case of
<PB N="350" REF="193"/>
wilful desertion, when for religions sake the unbeleeving party
leaves; Unbelief breaks not the Marriage-bond, renders it not
a nullity, (Religion being not of the substance of Marriage,)
It might make null all Covenants, as well as this Cove∣nant,
the Law of God seeing that condemnes Marriage-Cove∣nants
with unbeleevers, condemnes all other Covenants with
them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. 23. Having determined the point in an uni∣versal
proposition, or that which is equivalent with it, A Be∣leever
and an unbeleever joyned in Wedlock-bond, are not to
be separated, He meets with their scruples, and answers their
objections against it; That they had their scruples, must be con∣fest,
otherwise they had never sent the case to the Apostle, And
those scruples which reason it self will suggest, that have a faire
colour in Scripture for them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Corinthi∣ans</HI> scruples.</NOTE> and are met with, and satisfied by
the Apostle in this his answer; we must take to be their scruples
and grounds of their feares, Unlesse we had the <HI>Corinthians</HI> letter,
we have no other way of cognizance of them. And these are
two.</P>
<P>I shall mention the second in the first place, seeing I am to
dwell upon the first, and that is their jealousie of themselves, of
their own standing and perseverance in the Christian Faith. This
in reason they might well fear, who so active to seduce and draw a∣way
as a yoke-fellow? and this hath fair colour of Scripture for it,
<HI>Deut. 7. 4. They will turn away thy son from following me, that they
may serve other gods.</HI> Examples are not wanting, <HI>Nehem. 13. 26. Did
not</HI> Solomon <HI>King of</HI> Israel <HI>sin by these things? yet among many Na∣tions
was there no King like him, who was belov'd of his God, and
God made him King over all</HI> Israel, <HI>neverthelesse, even him did out∣landish
women cause to sinne.</HI> To this the Apostle answers, and op∣poses
the hopes of conversion of the unbelieving party; <HI>How
knowest thou O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how know∣est
thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</HI> As there is fear
of seducing, so there is hope of conversion.</P>
<P>The other is the condition of their issue, lest they should not
be reckoned with the Saints, but of the fellowship of uncleane
Gentiles. Reason is strong for this; they well knew that as it is with
the Parent, so it is with the Childe; for Church-state and conditi∣on,
being a priviledge communicable, and derived by descent from
Parent to Childe. If the Parent were without, and of the Gen∣tiles,
<PB N="351" REF="193"/>
the Childe was ever such, and in case the parents, were of the
people of God, their children were reckoned so in like manner.
Now Parents being divided, the one holy, the other unclean, they
feared that the issue would follow the worser part, a staine would
lie upon them, they would be accounted unclean with the unbe∣leeving
parent this hath a faire colour of Scripture likewise, and
in a like case it had been so determined, <HI>Ezra 10. 3.
Now therefore let us make a Covenant with our God, to put
away all the wives, and such as are borne of them.</HI> The Apostle
takes off these fears of theirs, and tells them that the unbel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving
party doth not (as they fear) defile the issue, but is sanctified,
as to issue, by the Beleever, so that their children are holy, and to
be reckoned with the believing Parent, who is a Saint, not un∣clean,
&amp; not reckoned with the unbeleeving parent, who is a Gen∣tile,
and so takes off their scruples respective both to themselves
and their issue, and quiets their fears. So that several positions
might be here laid down for a right understanding of the
words.</P>
<P>1. By [Beleever] in this place is meant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Explicatory Positions.</NOTE> a man or woman pro∣fessing
the true Faith, and bearing the name Christian.</P>
<P>2. By [Unbeleever] is meant, an Infidel▪ an unconverted Gen∣tile,
living in Idolatry, sacrificing to Devils, and not to God, of
such the question is put, and not of regenerate and unregenerate,
such a scruple was never heard, whether or no such might continue
marriage society.</P>
<P>3. To be [sanctified] here, is not to be made holy, which is the
case of the Regenerate; or to be set apart for God, which is the
case of the visible Saint and Christian; but together with
their yoke-fellow to be an holy root to produce an holy
seed.</P>
<P>4. By [Holy] is meant, federal holinesse, to be reputed and recei∣ved
among the people of God, who are holy, no other holinesse is
transmittible from parents to children.</P>
<P>5. By [Unclean] is meant, a sinner of the Gentiles, an alien and
stranger from the Common-wealth of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>6. [Else] implies a certainty, that upon this account of sanctifi∣cation
of the Parent (from whom the ground of fear arose) the
children are holy, a like certainty that were it not that they were
thus sanctified, they were unclean.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="194"/>
<HI>Much stir is made about this doubt of the</HI> Coronthians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ground or rise of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> scruples.</NOTE> <HI>from
whence it might arise.</HI> In my apprehension, <HI>sayes One,</HI> it is
likely that the doubt arose from the Epistle he wrote before to them
mentioned, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 9, 10. not to keep company with Fornicators,
or Idolaters, which might occasion the question, whether they were
then to continue with their unbeleeving yoke-fellow. <HI>To this con∣jecture
I answer.</HI></P>
<P>1. That many will not grant that the Apostle wrote any Epi∣stle
to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> before this; but as this carries the title
of the first, so there was none before it; and this they do, to
make it good that no Scripture given by divine inspiration is lost;
which would impeach (as they feare) both the providence of
God, and the faithfulnesse of the Church to whom the Oracles
of God were concredited. But let it be grauted that he wrote
another Epistle, which he here mentions; yet the tenth verse where
the stresse lies seems to be his present farther explanation of his
words there, and no part of the contents of that Epistle formerly
written, and so there is no roome left for this conjecture. But
put the case, that the ninth and tenth verses do both expresse the
Contents of that Epistle, yet why do they take both the
ends, and leave out the middle? Making their converse to be
with Husbands, or Wives, Fornicators or Idolaters, and not as
well with Covetous, or Extortioners? It is answered, <HI>the middle
termes</HI> [Covetous and Extortioners] <HI>are left out, because I con∣ceived
it superfluous for me to put them in. Their only scruple I
mentioned, was their conversing with the Idolatrous, or unbeleeving
yoke-fellow, because the Apostle only resolves that doubt,</HI> 1 Cor. 7. 12.
13, 14. <HI>about which the dispute I held was, Whether or no they
scrupled, conversing with Covetous and Extortioners, I could not tell;
because the Apostle is silent about that doubt.</HI> If their scruple was
concerning conversing with their <HI>Idolatrous yoke-fellows,</HI> upon
occasion of those words, <HI>not to keep them company,</HI> they must
needs scruple their conversing with <HI>Covetous and Extortioners,
Husbands or Wives</HI> upon the same account, and the Apostle
being silent in his answer, it is clear they were silent in their letter,
and moving no scruple, they had no scruple; when it is imposi∣ble
for them to scruple one upon those words, and not scruple
all. When the Apostle names four evils respective to civil so∣ciable
converse, it is a wilde fancy to imagine that they should
<PB N="353" REF="194"/>
startle at one (respective to their marriage-society) and question
no more. I farther adde: If this conjecture hold, the Apostle
thus writes to the <HI>Corinthians, If any brother hath a wife that is
an Idolator, Fornicator, a Drunkard or Extortioner, let him not
put▪ her away,</HI> and to this I am answered, <HI>Wise men do not alwayes
see the consequent of that principle which they are possest with.</HI> And
how comes it I wonder into any mans thoughts, that the <HI>Corinthi∣ans</HI>
had wit to see the consequence from his warning given of one
sort of sinners, and of never a one of the other named with them?
It is further said, <HI>If they had the occasion of the doubt from</HI> 1 Cor. 5. 9.
<HI>doth it follow that the Apostle must either know, that to have been the
occasion, or resolve their doubt with reference to it? and if he did, yet
there was no necessity he should resolve it in like manner concerning
Fornicators, as Idolaters.</HI> If the Apostle did not know it, how
comes it now to be known, did he want their Sagacity? If he did
know it, there must be a like necessity of resolving the doubt in
reference to this, as any other at which they scrupled. And if
they doubted of all; why is there a necessity of clearing one, and
not all, the Apostle doubtlesse took in every part, and piece of
their scruple. <HI>It is likely</HI> (saith one) <HI>the Apostle took in every
part and piece of that which is propounded to him as the</HI> Corinthians
<HI>scruple indeed; but there was no necessity he should take in every
part of that which Master</HI> Blake <HI>may imagine, would have been
their scruple if my conjecture hold.</HI> But there was a necessity to
take in all that had the same evident ground of scruple, and
which every ratinal man will not onely with me imagine; but
certainly conclude (<HI>Hoc supposito</HI>) must be their scruple, Had the
Apostle taken in every part of their scruple, the question about
divorce so much agitated, would have been determined. It is
wonder <HI>B. Howson, Bunney,</HI> and others that say <HI>Moses</HI> permis∣sion
to put away wives, was in case of Adultery only, could not
have hit upon this Text which would have salved all, to this is
answered.</P>
<P>If the Apostle had taken in every part of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> imagined
scruple, and resolved as I would have it; Yet, this doth not here de∣termine
the controversie so much agitated, whether the innocent
party might marry after a lawful Divorce.</P>
<P>The full truth is here now spoken, such a resolution had indeed
destroy'd the the thing supposed, and there could have been no
<PB N="354" REF="195"/>
lawful Divorce; and when the Apostle had determined against
all Divorce, and had given charge, as concerning the unbeleeving
wife, so concerning the wife of Fornication, If any man have
such a wife, let him not put her away, why should there be a∣ny
dispute about it, either respective to Divorce, or
Marriage after it. But as to this enough is spo∣ken.</P>
<P>Having examined that which others by their conjecture would
make the ground of their scruple; I must speak to that which
we make the occasion of it before suggested, <HI>viz.</HI> that case of those
Israelites, <HI>Ezra 9. 10. ch.</HI> who upon their returne from their cap∣tivity
had married strange wives, and were ordered not to live
with them, but to put them away with their children, and here
to prevent tedious impertinencies, and to make this piece as brief
as possible, let me premise this as an undoubted truth; That
these <HI>Corinthians</HI> had their scruples concerning their issue upon
their marriage in their disparity. That which the Apostle satis∣fies
in his Answer, that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> scrupled in their letter.
This no man can deny, for he writes to give satisfaction, (as is
plaine, <HI>verse</HI> 1.) to their letter-scruples: But we see in the Text
that he as satisfies scruples concerning themselves, so also con∣cerning
their issue▪ 2. Let the Reader know, that I do not pe∣remptorily
determine, that the determination of the case of the
Israelites, for their separation from their wives, and putting a∣way
their children with them, did occasion this scruple in the
thoughts of these <HI>Corinthians</HI> thus joyned, with unbeleeving
yoke-fellows, But I say, it is more then probable, that it did either
occasion, or mightily strengthen it, When they are men known
in the Scriptures, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 15. and did question their own
marriage upon the account of the unbelief of their yoke-fellow,
and finding a case thus determined, both against mother and child
for separation, how can we imagine but they hit upon it, and
were affected with it? 3. I do not say that the <HI>Israelites</HI> case
and the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were wholly the same, as it stood with <HI>Israel</HI>
then, and with the <HI>Corinthians</HI> now: I know it was not, for then
either <HI>Ezra</HI> had, been too harsh in ordering a separation; or
<HI>Paul</HI> too indulgent in determining the lawfulnesse of the conti∣nuance
of their marriage-society, and so I may say of their chil∣dren;
But I say their cases were so like, and so seemingly paral∣lel,
<PB N="355" REF="195"/>
that it might well occasion the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (thus in consci∣ence
concerned) to judge them the same. Their cases some∣what
did differ, but the <HI>Corinthians</HI> had need of the Apostles help
to see the difference. The cases were the very same in them∣selves,
but different in regard of divers administrations, under
which they respectively lived. <HI>He that would make their case the
same,</HI> (saith One) <HI>must not vary it in one particular: All Ca∣suists
and Lawyers determine a Case to be varied when one material
circumstance is varied. The Jews being under the Law of</HI> Moses,
<HI>and professing it; the Corinthians, Christians not so, and yet that
doubt as if occasioned by that fact, must arise from the doubted force
of the Law of God.</HI> This hits right upon the difference between
them, which yet argues them to be still in themselves the same,
had not times differenced them; whereas he sayes, the Jews were
under <HI>Moses</HI> Law professing it, but the <HI>Corinthian</HI>-Christians
not so. I hope he will not deny they were under the Moral Law,
the Apostle even in this Epistle pressing it upon them, 1 <HI>Cor.
9. 9. 1 Cor.</HI> 14. 34. and it was not so easie for them to deter∣mine
that the Command, <HI>Deut.</HI> 7. was judicial, purely respecting
their relation to those Nations, and so their case by this meanes
better then those Israelites, and being not able to determine, their
scruple remained, and they sought to the Apostle for satisfacti∣on
in it.</P>
<P>Having enquired into these <HI>Corinthians</HI> scruples we are to
look further into the meaning of the words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two hetero∣doxical inter∣pretations of the words, holy, unclean.</NOTE> and here we might
reckon up variety of interpretations of this Text in Ancient and
Moderne Writers, most of which are generally exploded, as
to the words <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>unclean,</HI> and therefore I think not fit to
trouble the Reader at all with them. Two there are which now
appeare especially in competition with this here delivered, which
I shall hold forth in this place, that the Reader may judge of ei∣ther.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first inter∣pretation set∣ting up parent and childe too high, examined</NOTE>
The first sets up parent and childe, root and branch too
high; The second layes the issue too low. The first is, that the
beleever here mentioned is an elect regenerate man, not only a
Professor of the faith, but a man endowed with the grace of faith,
not onely of the Church visible, but of the Church invisible like∣wise;
That the holinesse here mentioned is a real holinesse,
that is, an holinesse of regeneration, and the issue of one or both
regenerate persons is also such, regenerate. The issue of the
<PB N="356" REF="196"/>
unregenerate is (as they say) unregenerate likewise, An interpre∣tation
as far from the Apostles minde as that which is farthest, and
the doctrine fetched from it as untrue as that which is untruest.
The Beleever here is the man that is not an Infidel, one that is
taken off from Gentisme to the profession of Christianity. <HI>Pau∣linus</HI>
(whom <HI>Hierome</HI> so much admired) interprets it (as <HI>Hierom</HI>
relates his words, <HI>Ep.</HI> 153. of a baptized person. The <HI>Corinthians</HI>
never questioned the marriage between one party, in whom the
power of godlinesse appears, and another professingly of the
same faith, though not in that sincerity, There was never such a
scruple made, but the marriage between a professor of Christian
religion, and a Pagan; Neither is the issue of a regenerate man, be∣cause
his issue, regenerate; Habits, neither infused, nor acquired, are
thus communicated from parent to childe; Neither will it help to
say that this proposition is not universal, but indefinite, which holds
<HI>ad plurimum,</HI> but not alwayes; The Apostles proposition universally
holds, <HI>now are they holy,</HI> not in the opinion of charity, but certain∣ty,
where neither are holy, the issue, not only <HI>ad plurimum,</HI> but cer∣tainly
is unclean, not as to the judgement of our fears, but for his
present state, so infallibly. That assertion to help this out, that
God draws regeneration through the loynes of the Elect, at least
for the most part (few elect ones but their children are regenerate)
is such a paradox that I suppose very few will receive; And thence
to infer the lawfulnesse of the Baptisme of all of such birth, be∣cause
some are regenerate (and as then surmise the most, even in
the womb, and from the birth) is a bottome that will not bear it;
One without any name hath published a Treatise of Baptism, and
in it impugnes with all his strength Infant-baptisme. He takes
notice of this, and like positions of this nature, as our ground of
it, and then endeavours the battery of it It hath passed some yeers
without any answer, that I know. I could wish that those that
maintaine it on these grounds, would take upon them a refutation.
His reasons to me (the doctrine so grounded) are above answer.
I have often said, if I be brought to these mens premisses, I shall
then conclude with the Antipaedobaptists. It so much more con∣cerns
those, in that the Author (as I hear) was one of their society,
and they see how frequently their members that are principled a∣gainst
Covenant-holinesse, and borne in hand that the Gospel
strips us of it, do betake themselves from them into these mens
tenents.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="196"/>
The second interpretation laies the issue too low,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second in∣terpretation laying parent and childe too low.</NOTE> and will have
the holinesse mentioned, to have no respect to their spiritual or
Church-state, but onely their legitimation; They are not bastards
but legitimate, This Text (saith One) <HI>doth not speak of federal
holinesse, but of holinesse, that I may so call it matrimonial, so that
the sense is, your children are holy, that is, legitimate;</HI> adding
<HI>whether any in the ages before the age last past expounded it of fe∣deral
holinesse, as they call it, I am not yet certaine,</HI> His ar∣guments
against our interpretation of Covenant-holinesse and
uncleannesse, we shall examine, being attended as he sayes,
with many absurdities; in the mean space let me tell him, that
his interpretation, understanding the Apostle as he doth, (<HI>The un∣beleeving
husband is sanctified in the wife, &amp;c.</HI> that is, his society with
her is lawful, not adulterous, <HI>else your children were unclean,</HI> that
is, bastards, illegitimate, <HI>but now they are holy,</HI> that is, of a birth le∣gitimate,
not spurious) renders the reasoning here in this place.
1. Childish. 2. Incongruous. 3. Untrue.</P>
<P>1. Weak and childish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Weak and childish.</NOTE> to tell the <HI>Corinthians</HI> if their marriage-society
were adulterous, then their children were bastards, if their
marriage were nul, children were illegitimate. This is too low a way
of reasoning und unworthy of the Apostle such that every childe
well knew before the Apostle told them. In that great contest
about the marriage of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, with the relict of his bro∣ther
<HI>Arthur,</HI> (in which the judgement of so many Universities was
desired) if one had argued, that in case this marrige be a nullity,
then the Princesse is not legitimate: But the Princesse is legitimate;
<HI>Ergo</HI> the marriage is no nullity) he would have been looked upon
as a strange disputant.</P>
<P>2. Incongruous To bring phrases fully answering the Church-state
and condition of either parents▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Incongruous</NOTE> <HI>beleeving, unbeleeving,</HI>
(which in the Scripture is holy and uncleane) and yet to under∣stand
them of holinesse, and uncleannesse of another kinde, of
legitimation and bastardy, if they may be (as I think they never
were) so called, is meerly incongruous: That these words fully
answer the Church-state of parents, and the Church-state and con∣dition
which the children derive from them, is plaine in that pa∣rallel
text, <HI>Gal. 2. 15. Jews by nature,</HI> that is, holy by birth from
beleeving parents, not <HI>sinners of the Gentiles,</HI> not uncleane by birth
from unbeleeving ancestors; So Master <HI>Cartwright</HI> on these words
<PB N="358" REF="197"/>
in his answer to the Rhemists. <HI>If you will know what this holinesse
of children new-born is, the Apostle telleth you, it is through the
Covenant to be a Jew by nature, or birth: and if you will farther
understand what this uncleannesse of children is, the Apostle in the
same place telleth you, it is not to be sinners by nature, as those which
are born of the Heathen.</HI> I well know, and acquainted the Rea∣der,
<HI>p.</HI> 2. of my Birth-priviledge, that the Apostles scope, <HI>Gal.</HI>
2. 15. is another, <HI>viz.</HI> to prove that Jews and Gentiles have
both one and the same justification, not by works of the Law,
but by Faith, but falling upon the mention of the Jewe
and Gentile, he gives them characters (as Master <HI>Cart∣wright</HI>
well observes) fully parallel to that which is here deli∣vered.</P>
<P>3. The argument thus understood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Untrue.</NOTE> is untrue; The stresse is
wholly laid on the beleeving party, as to the holinesse of the
issue twice over; The unbeleever is meerly passive in
it, when the childe hath legitimation equally from both.</P>
<P>Against the former interpretation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments evincing the holinesse in the Text not to be legitimation.</NOTE> and for mine, which
<HI>Chamier</HI> affirmes to be <HI>Calvini, &amp; omnium nostrorum,</HI> take these
arguments. 1. That holinesse which necessarily follows to the
issue, from the sanctification of an unbeleeving, by a beleeving
yoke-fellow, is Covenant holinesse, and not legitimation: But
the holinesse in this place of the Apostle necessarily follows to
the issue, from the sanctification of an unbeleever by a beleever;
<HI>Ergo</HI> it is Covenant-holinesse, not legitimation. 2. That
which is derived from the eminency of one parent above another,
and not equally from both, is not legitimation: But this ho∣linesse
is derived from the eminence of one parent (<HI>viz.</HI> the
beleeving parent above the other;) <HI>Ergo</HI> it is not legitima∣tion.
3. The result or fruit which follows from a beleevers faith is
not legitimation: But the holinesse in the Text is a result of the
faith of the beleeving yoke-fellow; The minor is evident, seeing
faith is twice hinted at in the beleever. I know that there is one
that denies, that the unbeleeving husband, or wise is here said to be
sanctified in the beleeving; It is (saith he) <HI>in the husband, not
in the beleeving husband, in the wife, not in the beleeving wife, that
is not in the Text.</HI> The marriage is between a beleever and an
unbeleever, the unbeleever is sanctified whether husband or wife
by their yoke-fellow, but not as is said, by their beleeving yoke-fellow;
<PB N="359" REF="197"/>
the Reader that puts off his reason may matter such denials.</P>
<P>To evince sense of bastardy and legitimation from those
words of the Text,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sanctifica∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on spoken to, is not of parents in general, but of one parent beleeving, and another unbe∣leeving in par∣ticular.</NOTE> <HI>unclean</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> the Apostles argument is put
by one into this forme, <HI>If the unbeleeving husband were not
sanctified by the wife, then were your children uncleane; But they
are not uncleane, but holy;</HI> Ergo, <HI>the unbeleeving husband is san∣ctified
by the wife.</HI> And this sequel (as is said) were not true,
if this proposition were not true; <HI>All the children of those parents
where one is not sanctified to the other, are unclean.</HI> <Q>The Pro∣position
is, of an unbelieving husband and a wife, and yet the Pro∣position
must be of all parents, that will prove it, as he that wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
prove, If an Englishman be noble, he is honourable, must prove
it by this universal or general, All Noble men are honourable,
and not put in all Englishmen Noble, for then he antecedent
and the conclusion would be all one, whereas the Proposition
proving, must be larger then the Proposition proved, else we
might conclude <HI>ex meris particularibus;</HI> To say if the unbeleeving
husband were not sanctified by the wife, your children were un∣clean
is all one with this, All the children of the unbeleeving
husband not sanctified to the wife are uncleane.</Q> This of it selfe
is not such, that many words should need to be spent about it,
But seeing that a learned hand, layes so much, and so great stress
upon it; It may not be slightly passed over, and who sees not
here a wilde parallel well worthy of such a monstrous assertion,
The proposition is, of two standing in full disparity, and an in∣stance
is given in a single person, where there is no disparity at
all, and by two adjuncts which are <HI>Synonyma:</HI> I desire to know
how this sequel may be proved, If a wife of an ignoble birth
be not made Noble by her husband, her issue is ignoble; must
it be proved by this Proposition, The issue of every wife not
made noble by her husband, is ignoble? or will it serve,
The issue of every ignoble wife not made noble by her husband
is ignoble? If a poore man take a wife, and is not enricht by her,
he still remaines in a poore condition; shall this be made good by
a proposition, That all men taking wives, and not enricht by
them are in a poore condition; or will it serve that every poor
man taking a wife, and not enricht by her, is in a poore condi∣tion?
are these true, or are they false propositions. Yea, what
is affirmed in his own instance, to prove that if an Englishman be
<PB N="360" REF="198"/>
noble, he is honourable, it is sufficient to prove it by this Proposi∣tion;
All Englishmen noble, are honourable, will not hold. Let
any one tell me how he will make good this Proposition: If a
Dutchman be borne of a Duke, he is a Duke; if he be borne of
an Earle he is an Earle, must it be; All men born of Dukes, are
Dukes, of Earles, are Earles; This with us in <HI>England</HI> is false,
but of all Dutch men thus borne it is truth; But the reason gi∣ven
must be looked into, <HI>The antecedent and the conclusion</HI> (saith
he) <HI>would be all one, whereas the Proposition proving must be lar∣ger
then the Proposition proved.</HI> But who knows not, that the
Proposition proving is larger here then the proposition proved.
A proposition express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly universal, is larger in a Logick argu∣ment,
then either an indefinite or particular. The Proposition
by him excepted against, in Logick consideration is as universal
as that which is most universal; Every Englishman that is no∣ble,
is honourable, is an universal Proposition, as well as every
man that is noble, is honourable; and I never learnt that in the
quantity of propositions, there is <HI>magis &amp; minus.</HI> I am chal∣lenged
for saying, <HI>The truth of the Apostles sequel depends on this
proposition; All the children of an unbeleever are uncleane, unlesse
for generation he or she be sanctified by a beleever;</HI> and addes, <HI>I
deny it, in that the termes, [for generation by a Beleever] are
added by him, not in the Apostle, and so he changed the termes.</HI> I
pray leave generation out, and see whether there can be any sense
in it, unlesse it be understood; Their sanctification will confer
no legitimation, without generation; If I say not beleever, I must
say husband or wife that is a beleever.</P>
<P>Another bottome on which the forenamed interpretation is
grounded is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apostle brings not for∣mal arguments to conclude the lawfulness of marriage-soci∣ety, but removes scruples con∣cerning their o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n state and their issue.</NOTE> That the Apostle in this Text brings a formal argu∣ment
to prove the marriage-society of these yoke-fellows to be
lawful, which in the two former verses he had determined, and
(as was confest before) they scrupled, and it cannot be denied but
the words at first sight, seem to carry some colour to understand
them so farre in this sense, as to make them formal, concluding
reasons of his former determination, Having said, <HI>verse 12, 13.
If any brother hath a wife that beleeveth not, and she be pleased to
dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman that hath
an husband that beleeveth not, and he be pleased to dwell with her, let
her not leave him;</HI> then he adds, <HI>For the unbeleeving husband is san∣ctified
<PB N="361" REF="198"/>
by the wife; and the unbeleeving wife is sanctified by the hus∣band,
else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</HI> But
the way of inference will as well bear it; that the Apostle doth
first determine the Controversie by revelation as an Apostle,
and then takes off their scruples which occasioned their feares,
both respective to their posterity and themselves; This way of
interpretation is charged as making the Apostle immethodical,
but what better method then to determine a point, and then an∣swer
reasons against it; The Apostle meeting with their fears
in respect both of their posterity, and themselves, it must needs
be that they signified them, and he removes them; The Apostles
method (it is true) and manner of inference indifferently fa∣vours
either interpretation; But the words themselves clearly
evince, that they are a removal of scruples against their marriage-society,
and not a formal concluding argument for it. Let us
look first into <HI>verse</HI> 16. where <HI>[For]</HI> may lay as faire a claime
to a formal reason as this in the fourteenth, and such that stand
for this interpretation say, it is a formal reason, But I would
faine learn how any one can make it up into a reason; He must
thus draw it up, whom man in marriage-society may have hopes to
save from idolatrous wayes, with such a one he may continue
marriage-society; But a beleeving husband in marriage-society
may have hopes to save his unbeleeving wife from idolatrous
wayes, <HI>Ergo.</HI> This proposition as to such a conclusion is. 1. Vaine,
for, though there were no such hopes, yet marriage-society is to
be continued, Gentilisme being not of the subsistence of mar∣riage.
2. This Proposition is false as to this purpose; The incestu∣ous
<HI>Corinthian</HI> might have hopes to have had converted his fathers
wife, (if a Heathen) and yet such hopes would not conclude the
lawfulnesse of their society together; <HI>Herod</HI> might have had like
hopes to have converted his brother <HI>Philips</HI> wife, and yet this was
not objected against <HI>John Baptist,</HI> and had it been objected, it had
been frivolous. We have many cases put about marriage, if such
an argument would serve the turne, it would salve them all. And
for <HI>verse</HI> 14. though I cannot say, but in case it were made up
into a reason of the former conclusion, it would contain a truth,
and so far might passe in the way of a reason, yet I have many ma∣terial
exceptions against it.</P>
<P>1. From the thing it self, it would be a reason (though true,
<PB N="362" REF="199"/>
yet) silly, childish, vaine, your married condition is lawful, else
your children were bastards; what childe in <HI>Corinth</HI> (as was
hinted when I spake of the Apostles words, as in themselves that
knew the right hand from the left) but well understood it?
There is not a boy that plays in the streets, but knows that children
born out of wedlock are bastards. There is a Book published, put∣ting
it to the question, and disputing it, whether marriages be∣tween professours of the true religion and Infidels, and so of Pa∣pist,
with Protestants, be not <HI>ab initio,</HI> null, and they to be sepa∣rated
in case any shall now come in with this argument for the ne∣gative,
that they are not null, and to conclude their continuance;
If such marriage be null; their children are bastards: But they
are not bastards, <HI>Ergo</HI> the marriage is not null; the Authour or
any other might be brought to a smile, not to conviction. As
<HI>Erasmus</HI> in his censure of those suppositio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s spurious Epistles
that have past with many for <HI>Pauls</HI> to <HI>Seneca,</HI> charges them
with no false doctrine, but is bold to say, I see not what can be said
more simply or senselesly, and that there is nothing in them worthy
of <HI>Pauls</HI> spirit; So I may say of this suppositio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s spurious inter∣pretation
put upon this Text in <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistle. <HI>Erasmus</HI> is de∣servedly
troubled that these Epistles should have their verbosous
Comments, any may equally be troubled that such a
reason should finde defence from any hand in so many
words.</P>
<P>My next challenge is from the phrase in which it is delivered,
altogether unsutable to a reason of this doctrine, upon a threefold
account. 1. The Apostle being onely to tell them, that the le∣gitimation
of their issue proved the lawfulnesse of their marriage-society,
he should attribute all (as to either sex) to the beleever,
when the childe owes his legitimation equally to either parent,
to the unbeleever as much as the beleever. 2. That being to give
reason of the lawfulnesse of marriage in such a special case, he
should give his reason of equal concernment to all marriages,
where both are unbeleevers, both beleevers, as well as this between
a beleever and an unbeleever. 3. When he is to speak only of le∣gitimation
and bastardy, he should praise it in such uncouth
language, and in words, fit it onely, sutable to their parent, Eccle∣siastical
capacity, whether title to it, as in the beleever, or want
of it as in the unbeleever; now, on the other hand interpret the
<PB N="363" REF="199"/>
Apostles words (as his method will equally bear) accordingly as
you have heard before, and no such inconveniency follows from
the words either <HI>verse</HI> 14. or 16. And now our adversary may
easily receive an answer to that odious inference, which he makes
from our interpretation of Covenant-holinesse: <HI>According to
this interpretation</HI> (saith he) <HI>the</HI> medium <HI>of the Apostle to prove
the lawfulnesse of the living of a beleeving wife with an unbeleeving
husband, will as well prove the lawfulnesse of a beleeving fornicatrix
with an unbeleeving fornicator, as may appeare</HI> (saith he) <HI>by a
Syllogisticall Analysis of the Apostles argument, the major where∣of
is this, That man and woman may live together, notwithstanding
the unbelief of one party, whereof one is sanctified to the other for
begetting an holy seed.</HI> This is manifestly the Apostles reason, he
sayes after our interpretation. But he is manifestly mistaken;
not to mention the liberty that he will scarce allow another to
leave out husband and wife exprest in the text, and instead of it
to put man and woman: The Apostle doth not conclude the law∣fulnesse
of their marriag-society by the federation of their issue,
but shews that the supposed and feared non-federation doth not
conclude the unlawfulnesse, and I dare yeeld that any man and
woman may live together, notwithstanding any feare of the un∣holinesse
of their issue; where one is sanctified by the faith of a∣nother,
to the begetting of a seed federally holy. And if he will
apply this, which the Apostle speaks, of a mans living with his
wife (<HI>ad faciendum populum</HI>) to the living with his whore, there
is no danger to yeeld it; <HI>Pharez</HI> his issue had belonged to the
Common-weale of <HI>Israel,</HI> if <HI>Tamar</HI> had been an Infidel, as for
ought we know, and in all probability it was, with <HI>Jephtaes</HI> mo∣ther.
If <HI>Sampson</HI> had issue by the Harlot of <HI>Gaza,</HI> Judges 16. 1.
such issue had belonged to <HI>Israel,</HI> such issue male had right to
Circumcision. To gratifie him I shall put it under my hand, that
if a man have no other reason from Scripture to leave his Har∣lot
then the non-federation of his issue, he may still abide with
her, and that he is not bound upon that sole account to desert her
If any shall attempt to keep up these two maine propositions by
me examined, on which the whole fabrick of a long discourse is
built, for to make good the interpretation mentioned, and refute
the arguments against it, I shall readily and willingly look into
it, which for several yeares I have waited, till then I shall
<PB N="364" REF="200"/>
conclude that federal holinesse and not legitimation is here in∣tended.</P>
<P>A mighty stirre is here further made about instrumental sancti∣fication,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A vindication of instrumental sanctification.</NOTE>
and arguments heaped by Master <HI>Tombes</HI> against it, the
most of them grounded upon those two Propositions (which he
would have his Reader beleeve that I confesse, when he cannot
prove,) <HI>That al the children whereof one parent is not sanctified to the
other are unclean; none of the children whereof the one is not san∣ctified
to the other are cleane,</HI> together with the other; <HI>That this is
a concluding formal reason to prove the lawfulnesse of their abode to∣gether;</HI>
upon this account it is affirmed that our interpretation
fits not the case of persons disabled from procreation, it makes
the Apostles argument to be from a future contingent, <HI>I appeal
to any Logician and Grammarian whether a person may be said
to be instrumentally sanctified for such an effect which he
neither doth nor can produce? Whether a woman may be said to be
sanctified</HI> quoad hoc, <HI>so farre as to bring forth an holy seed, by ver∣tue
of the faith of her husband, who is by age or accidental impo∣tency
utterly disabled naturally from bearing any children, and
hath no supernatural power enabling her thereto? whether she may
be capable to bring forth an holy seed, who is not capable to bring
forth any at all? bringing forth an holy seed cannot be without
bringing forth a seed, and therefore the woman uncapable to bring
forth a seed is uncapable to bring forth an holy seed.</HI> And <HI>I</HI> on the contrary appeal to any, yea, the meanest Christian whether per∣sons
that have children born in wedlock-bonds, in such disparity
may not have their fears and scruples about them, notwithstanding
other in the same condition of marriage are childlesse, or unable to
bring forth children? Whether the seed which came of those mar∣riages,
<HI>Ezra</HI> 10. were not uncleane, notwithstanding many so
married had no children? many of the Priests had herein transgrest,
and it was but <HI>some of them that had wives by whom they had children,</HI>
Ezra 10. 44. And because this is the <HI>medium</HI> for proof of the A∣postles
determination, <HI>verse</HI> 13. that they might live together,
it must needs be from a future contingent; but when this is no
<HI>medium</HI> for proof of the Apostles determination, as hath been suf∣ficiently
shewn it is not, this falls with the other.</P>
<P>Two arguments against instrumental sanctification I shall
take notice of, which seeme to have some other bottome.
<PB N="365" REF="200"/>
1. <HI>That the act of producing an holy seed is not from any special
designation of God, and therefore cannot be meant of instrumental
sanctification, seeing an instrument must be the instrument of the
principal agent which can be no other then God;</HI> I am sure they
bring forth children unto God, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 20. and this they do
not independently of themselves, so Christ would not have
warned, <HI>Matth. 23. 10. Call no man father upon earth, for one is your
Father whech is in heaven.</HI> All natural parents are instruments of
God to produce a seed to people the world, according to that
blessing of <HI>Gen. 1. 28. Gen. 9. 1. Be fruitful and multiply, and re∣plenish
the earth;</HI> All beleeving parents are instruments of God for
an holy seed, it being of his free grace that the promise is to them
and their seed.</P>
<P>The second argument is that <HI>many a child of both unbeleeving pa∣rents
are federaly holy;</HI> and being answered that they are not
so at their birth, if afterwards by grace they are changed, this
is no fruit of their birth (of which the question is in this place)
but the work of the Gospel through grace. It is replied,
<HI>This is nothing to the purpose, sith the Proposition hath not those
words in it, nor the Apostle; the Apostles reason supposeth it
cannot be at any time;</HI> It seems then that the Apostles Propositi∣on
hath this in it, that their children so borne, are unclean
by birth and for all eternity shall so remaine never to be clean∣sed,
or else this exception is lesse to purpose, who does not see
that the Apostle speaks uncleannesse or holinesse as a product of
their birth? without consideration of any thing which after by
providence (through the omnipotence and free grace of God)
might happen, as a mean woman given in marriage to a Senator or
Peer, she is enobled by her husband, otherwise her issue were ple∣beians,
yet so as they are capable of honour by the Princes muni∣ficence,
or their own merit; It seems that Proposition of Christs,
<HI>That which is borne of the flesh,</HI> John 3. 6. will not hold, unlesse
it must for ever continue flesh, and no omnipotence of God shall
be able to make it otherwise. It is further said, <HI>and yet it may be cer∣tain
that the child of two unbeleevers may be federally holy at birth,
whether it be understood of Election, inherent holinesse, or outward holi∣nesse
if God please to work, and declare it.</HI> To this I onely say, let that
proposition stand, till God by such a miracle confute, or contradict
it, and whensoever he shall thus own such unclean infants as fede∣rally
holy, I shall be silent.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="201"/>
It is farther said, <HI>But the issue of them that are not lawfully
enjoyned as husband and wife, cannot be made legitimate by God,
because it is contrary to the definition of legitimation, which is a
state consequent upon birth by the lawful copulation of lawful
husband and wife.</HI> So that the reply is brought to this, because
God by his omnipotence can make our uncleane ones holy,
and to make their uncleane ones holy, is without the verge of
omnipotence; therefore his interpretation stands and ours must
fall. If we should put case in their manner, that God should ap∣pear

<P>THe next Scripture Text to make good the point in hand, is
<HI>Gal. 4. 29. As then he that was borne after the flesh per∣secuted
him that was borne after the Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Text Analysed.</NOTE> <HI>even so it is now.</HI> For
the clearing of which I have observed heretofore in the Apostles
words there. First, the History. Secondly, the Mystery by way
of Allegory. Thirdly, the parallel by the Apostle observed and ap∣plied
to his own times.</P>
<P><HI>The History we finde,</HI> verse 22, 23. It is written that <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
had two sonnes, the one by a bond-maide, the other by a free-woman,
but he who was of the bond-woman was born after the flesh,
but he of the free-woman was by promise.</P>
<P><HI>The Mystery by way of Allegory,</HI> verse 24, 25, 26. Which
things are an Allegory, for these are the two Covenants, the one from
the Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> which gendereth to bondage, which is <HI>Agar.</HI>
For this <HI>Agar</HI> is Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and answereth to
<HI>Hierusalem</HI> which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
But <HI>Hierusalem</HI> which is above is free, which is the mother of
us all.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="201"/>
The parallel in these words, <HI>But as then, he that was born after
the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so it is now.</HI>
From whence this argument is drawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The argumen deduced from it.</NOTE> If there yet remaine in the
bosome of the Church children borne after the flesh, as well as
those that are borne of the Spirit, (so that the distinction of
births, as applied to <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed, still hath place among Chri∣stians)
then there is that priviledge of birth-holinesse still re∣maining;
The consequence is plaine, Birth of the flesh in the
Church gave a Church-interest, The Apostles kinsemen after
the flesh, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 3. were all Church-members. That there is
is such a birth yet remaining, the Text quoted makes cleare;
<HI>Ishmael</HI> was in <HI>Abrahams</HI> family, and was by birth of his family,
and did persecute in the family, and was by birth of his family,
and did persecute in the family, as the Apostles shews out of Scri∣ture
History, Men in the Church, borne in the Church, by birth∣right
of the Church, do persecute, as upon experience he affirms,
and so makes up the parallel. There birth of the flesh, is the high∣est
honour they attaine; when others have the same with an ad∣dition
to it; this implies two things. 1. A birth of nature, a childe by
lineal descent of such a father. 2. Outward prerogatives that ac∣company
such a birth.</P>
<P>I know and have declared that this is not that which the Apo∣stle
here chiefly intends, or is about to hold out. But this I
affirme, that he occasionally layes down, that which I here have
delivered. And by this free concession of mine, any man in rea∣son
might have thought, that I had prevented that which is still
charged upon that which from this Text I have inferred, or rather
that which in this Text I have observed, one largely shewing
that these words in hand, <HI>are a compound proposition, which Logi∣cians
call a comparative proposition, in which are two parts, a
Protasis, and an Apodosis, or rendring, wherein that which answers
the fore part, first held out, is expressed, now that alwayes notes
some agreement, correspondence, parity or likenesse, whether in
quantity, quality, action, &amp;c. But according to my Apodosis or
reddition</HI> (as is said) <HI>there is no such answerablenesse, or likenesse,
as hath the shew of a comparison of things equal or alike (as this is
as the affirmative termes shew) for who would conceive any better
then non-sense, in such a speech as this, Even as</HI> Ishmael <HI>persecu∣ted</HI>
Isaac, <HI>so the children of Christian beleevers are visible members
<PB N="368" REF="202"/>
in the Christian Church. It were all one as to say even as</HI> Esau <HI>ha∣ted</HI>
Jacob, <HI>so godly men are heirs of heaven, or have accesse to God.</HI>
The absurdity of which with him is so grosse, that the man is ama∣zed
that I do not see it, nor will confesse it. Being above his strength
to answer that sense; which I give of the words, he is pleased to
take paines to make them up, by his glosse, into non-sense, that so
no answer may need, But he well knows or might know, that I
have not to deale with the whole of that <HI>Protasis,</HI> nor the whole
of that <HI>Apodosis,</HI> and not at all with the persecution there menti∣oned,
but onely with the distinction there let fall, which is a di∣stinction
of births, both in <HI>Abrahams</HI> family, and in the Church,
in Gospel-times, which the Apostle in his Application in those
words <HI>[Then]</HI> and <HI>[Now,]</HI> plainly doth demonstrate. The truth
which the Apostle supposes, and takes for granted, I have here to
speak to, and not to that, which by way of allegory, he infers from
it, or applies to it, and so the list of authours here brought in by
my adversary; speaking of the persecution of Christians, by Jews
and Papists, may all of them speak truth; but none of them all, a∣ny
thing against me, who deduce no more from the words, but
that a distinction of births is there laid down, or rather taken for
granted, which is by the Apostle allegorised, but the allegory is
not at all within that which I am upon. I met with like dealings,
from the same hand; when I did compare, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 7. 14. with <HI>Gal.</HI>
2. 15. to make good a title to Covenant-holinesse, by birth of
nature, both with Jew and Gentile. I then heard those words of
the poet, <HI>Cerni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, an qui amant, ipsi sibi somnia fingunt?</HI> But the
evidence of truth, with Master <HI>Cartwrights</HI> authority, making them
as to the thing, full parallel (as to every eye they are) hath there
wrought some silence, so I doubt not, but it will follow here. It is
not the Apostles intention, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 15. to speak of the birth-priviledg
of the Jews, nor yet the want of it in the Gentiles, yet there he
mentions both,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 4. 29.</NOTE> neither is it his intention to treat of such a distincti∣on
of births, in the Church. Jewish or Christian, but the hostile dis∣position
of one, so born; against another, yet in that place he
plainly signifies such a distinction of births in either Church, both
Jewish and Christian. Can any man deny that <HI>Abraham</HI> had two
sons of such different births, as the Apostle from the hystory in
<HI>Genesis</HI> shews, <HI>v. 22, 23. Ishmael</HI> is set out as a son of <HI>Abraham,</HI>
and upon that account we know he had the honour of circumci∣sion,
<PB N="369" REF="202"/>
<HI>Isaac</HI> had the same, but a degree of further honour with
it, being born as <HI>Ishmael</HI> was not) by promise, And whatsoever
Allegory the Apostle makes of it (which is not to my purpose to
examine) yet in his reddition or application, he looks at the hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>story,
not at the allegory, as the adverbs of time, <HI>Then, Now,</HI>
(neither of which are allegorised) do demonstrate. And though
<HI>Ishmael</HI> may be a type of a justitiary, seeking righteousnesse by
works, and persecuting those that seek a righteousnesse by faith,
whether <HI>typus, factus, or destinatus</HI> I will not enquire, yet, I
think, it will never be proved; that <HI>Ishmael</HI> was such a one, in
his own person, persecuting <HI>Isaac</HI> on that account; which must
be proved, if the Apostle in his reddition do no look at the history,
but the allegory as my adversary contends or else he speaks besides
the purpose, <HI>[Then]</HI> looks at the history denoting time, as none
can deny, and <HI>[Now]</HI> must not referre to the allegory without
great absurdity. My interpretation (as is said) will not hold,
in that according to it, there is no agreement, correspondency,
or parity in the parts of the compound proposition, And I won∣der;
what agreement, correspondency or parity there is, or can
be, in the parts of this compound proposition, according to the
interpretation opposed against me, confounding history and al∣legory
together. Thus it must be, as <HI>Ishmael</HI> no justitiary, then
jeered <HI>Isaac,</HI> a sucking babe (as my adversary out of <HI>Hierome</HI>
speaks) who was not in capacity to look after any righteousnesse,
so it is now; justitiaries persecute those that do follow after righ∣teousnesse
by faith. If this glosse stand it should not be, <HI>so it is
now,</HI> but rather, <HI>now it is otherwise.</HI> He that will come to a right
understanding of the Text, must refer this 29. <HI>verse</HI> to 22, and 23.
looking upon <HI>verse</HI> 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. (where the allegory is pro∣secuted)
as a parenthisis, seeing the words in <HI>v.</HI> 29. cannot be re∣fer'd
to the allegory in those words, where there is no mention
made of persecution but to the history in the former. I am told,
that <HI>the Apostles distribution, cannot be, of a subject by its adjuncts,
but, of a genus, into its species, because</HI> [birth] <HI>is neither substance,
quantity, nor quality; but an action, or a passion, and actions though
they be capable of various modifications, yet Logiscians (as is said)
do not call them subjects.</HI> But doubtlesse the person borne, is and
may be called a subject, and stands in a capacity of adjuncts, and
I look to the persons here distinguished, some with more inferior,
<PB N="370" REF="203"/>
and others with more noble adjuncts. When I cite may Master
<HI>Baine</HI> (brought in against me as an adversary) saying, <HI>The chil∣dren
of the flesh here, are those onely who in course of nature came from</HI>
Abraham, <HI>I am told, it is true, that Mr.</HI> Bayne <HI>so interprets the
terme [children of the flesh,</HI> Rom. 9. 8.] as I have cited him, <HI>which
place he meant, but not the terme [he that is borne after the flesh,</HI> Gal.
4. 29.] <HI>yea,</HI> p. 138. <HI>he saith, for though children of the flesh, in some
other Scripture (meaning</HI> Gal. 4 29.) <HI>doth note out justitiaries, seek∣ing
salvation in the Law, yet here</HI> (Rom. 9. 8.) <HI>the literal meaning
is, to be taken, a childe of the flesh, being such a one who descendeth
from Abraham according to the flesh.</HI> But how can Mr. <HI>Bayne</HI> pos∣sibly
meane, Gal. 4 29. (as I am here told he doth) when he speaks
of the children of the flesh, when those words are not to be found
there, [but born after the flesh] and those terms [children of the
flesh] and [born after the flesh]▪ are in this very place by my ad∣versary
distingushed. And though Master <HI>Bayne</HI> do not quote,
<HI>Gal</HI> 4 29. in that place which I mentioned, yet <HI>Doctor</HI> Abbot <HI>in
Thomsoni diatribam,</HI> p. 115. saith. <HI>Circumcisus est</HI> Ishmael, <HI>cir∣cumcisus
&amp;</HI> Isaac, <HI>solus autem</HI> Isaac, <HI>natus secundum spiritum,</HI> Ish∣mael
<HI>tantummodo secundum carnem, non est autem justificatus, qui
natus est tantum modo secundum carnem,</HI> Ishmael <HI>quanquam cir∣cumcisus,
non est tamen justificatus, &amp;c.</HI> Here he plainly makes
the birth of the flesh, an honour giving circumcision, though an
honour inferiour to that of the birth of the spirit which justi∣fication
accompanies, and he quotes <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 29. as a proof of what
he speaks, and I am much engaged to my Antagonist, for his quo∣tation
out of <HI>Hierome. Sicut ergo, tum; major frater</HI> Ishmael, <HI>la∣ctentem
adhuc &amp; parvulum persequabatur</HI> Isaac, <HI>sibi circumcisionis
prerogativum, sibi primogenita vendicans, ita &amp; nunc, &amp;c.</HI> Whence
had he this prerogative of circumcision, but from this birth,
that I speak of from <HI>Abraham,</HI> and there is, the like prerogative
of birth; still continuing, or else there is no parity in the Apostles
reddition. Here I shall take notice of a fourfold absurdity endea∣voured
to be fastened upon me.</P>
<P>1. That I understand <HI>this to be said of Infants which then must
be said to persecute,</HI> But I understand it not of Infants, but of
those, which sometimes were Infants; and had their birth in in∣fancy,
from such and such parents.</P>
<P>2. That I take <HI>[being born after the flesh] in the latter part to
<PB N="371" REF="203"/>
note a natural birth, but that is clean besides the Apostles meaning,
who considers persons borne after the flesh, not as borne by humane
members and seed, but as born by a fleshly covenant, otherwise it would
import no allegory, contrary to the Apostles speech,</HI> ver. 24. <HI>which tells
us these things are an allegory.</HI> If I should take it in one part of the
proposition, in one sense, and in another part of the proposition,
in another sense I should then quite spoile the agreement, which
I am told must be in it, and then <HI>I</HI> might have been indeed argued
against for an absurdity whereas it is said that the <HI>Apostle considers
persons borne after the flesh, not as born by humane members and seed,
but as borne by a fleshly Covenant, I</HI> say, that, that is false, as to
the history, and <HI>I</HI> have shewed by reasons that have yet no sa∣tisfying
answer that the Apostle, <HI>v.</HI> 22, 23. lays down the history,
which afterwards he allegorizes in five verses, and then makes ap∣plication
of the history, and not of the allegory, <HI>v.</HI> 29.</P>
<P>3. That to be [born after the flesh] should import, birth of <HI>Abraham,</HI>
as a beleever, and so natural generation, of each child of a beleever in
that respect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut then [to be borne after the flesh] would be common
to <HI>Isaac</HI> with <HI>Ishmael,</HI> to him that is borne after the spirit, of the
free woman by promise, with him that is borne after the flesh of the
the bond-woman; for to be borne of <HI>Abraham,</HI> or a beleever agrees
also to <HI>Isaac,</HI> to him that is born after the Spirit, of the free-woman
by promise; whereas to be borne after the flesh is taken in a sense from
which <HI>Isaac</HI> and we, that is, <HI>Paul</HI> and other Christian beleevers are
excluded. <HI>That is, that certain clear truth by way of necessary co∣rollary
would follow, which that great Doctor</HI> Abbot, <HI>in the
place quoted takes for granted, speaking of both births, and ap∣plying
his</HI> tantummodo <HI>twice over to</HI> Ishmaels <HI>birth, he clearly sig∣nifies,
that</HI> Ishmael <HI>had this honour, and that</HI> Isaac <HI>had it likewise,
and that which is far more noble together with it.</HI></P>
<P>4. It is said, <HI>that I quite pervert the Apostles intent, in taking [to
be born after the flesh] to impart an honour, whereas the Apostle men∣tions,
birth after the flesh, as a debasement, takes it in the worser part,
not as importing a descent from the father, but from the mother and
that mother a bond woman, and therefore the children, servants, or
bond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slaves, by reason of their being borne after the flesh.</HI> And doth not
the Apostle tell us, in the relation of the history, of their father
as well as their mother? does he not speak of one common fa∣ther,
in these words, <HI>Abraham had two sons,</HI> as well as of two dif∣ferent
<PB N="372" REF="204"/>
mothers? and <HI>I</HI> dare not take the boldnesse to exclude ei∣ther.
<HI>I</HI> confesse the Apostle mentions [birth after the flesh] as
a debasement, in putting it in opposition to [birth of the Spirit,]
yet <HI>I</HI> affirme, that he mentions it also, as an honour. As circum∣cision
was a debasement in one respect, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 11, and an honour
in another, <HI>Rom. 3. 1. Phil.</HI> 3. 5. It was an honour to have Cir∣cumcision
in the flesh, they were thereby a people of God in Co∣venant,
but it was a debasement, being put in opposition to cir∣cumcission
in heart; and to the worshipping of God in Spirit and
in Truth; it was an honour to be born of <HI>Abraham,</HI> after the flesh,
and frequently mentioned in Scripture as an honour, but an abase∣ment,
when it is opposed to the birth of God by the Spirit. Much
more might be animadverted, but this is enough (as <HI>I</HI> think) to
the cause, and <HI>I</HI> purposely avoid all that concernes the person, <HI>I</HI>
know not what more may be said, but <HI>I</HI> finde nothing, as yet, said;
but that which instead of evincing the contrary (being thoroughly
examined) is a more full confirmation, that in New Testament-times,
such a distinction of births, is in New Testament-times con∣tinned,
clearly hinted and taken for granted here, and in other
Scriptures fully exprest.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>In the words that we have in hand, we see. 1. Their admissi∣on;
or at least charge given for it; <HI>Suffer little children to come
unto me.</HI> 2. The reason, <HI>for of such is the Kingdome of God.</HI> Here
is wont to be enquired. 1. What moved these thus to present
their children.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon what ac∣count these in∣fants were ten∣dered to Christ.</NOTE> This by the Evangelists is expressed; <HI>that Christ
would put his hands upon them, and pray.</HI> Which as they requested,
so he condescended to answer, <HI>He put his hands upon them, and
blessed them.</HI> They looked upon Christ (as it seemes) as a great
Prophet highly in favour with God, and such were wont to bless
in the name of God, and their blessing was highly prized. Hands
were used to be imposed as in sacrifices, <HI>Exod.</HI> 29. 10. so on per∣sons
in blessing, <HI>Gen.</HI> 48 14. The reason that moved his Di∣sciples
to forbid their coming, can scarce be doubted. They saw
men resorting to Christ;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why they were forbidden by the Disciples.</NOTE> either moved by his Doctrine, or his
Miracles, either to be instructed, or cured; neither of these could
be in their thoughts that presented these little ones. They were
uncapable of his teaching, being infants; and that they needed
not his cure, being not diseased, and therefore they rebuked
<PB N="394" REF="205"/>
those that came to tender them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Positions rend∣ing to clear Christ admis∣sion of them.</NOTE> Now to come to a clear under∣standing
of the words, we shall lay first some positions concern∣ing
these Infants admission, and afterwards come to the conside∣ration
of the reason.</P>
<P>First, <HI>That these were Infants, or as Infants in an incapacity to
learne ought from Christ, and so actually to imbrace Christ, or enter
Covenant themselves with him.</HI> Which does appear. 1. In
that they are called little ones, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 2. They were brought,
and came not on their own accord. 3. In that Christ took
them up in his armes. 4. Had they been capable by age of in∣struction,
with what colour could any have denied them? Why
might not they come as well as those multitudes that flocked to
him? 5. Why were not the children themselves spoke to, to for∣bear
to come, rather than those that brought them, not to bring
them? If they were capable of instruction, they were capable of
rebuke. 6. Why is there no word of instruction spoken to them?
The young man that came to Christ, was instructed by Christ
in the same Chapter. So should these have been instructed as
well as blest, had they been in a capacity for instruction.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>As they were in an incapacity by reason of age to be
taught, so they were not (as was said) diseased to have need of cure.</HI>
This the Disciples well knew that this was usual with Christ to
cure those that laboured under infirmities of all ages, and there∣fore
would never have had it in their thoughts to have rebuked
those that brought these, and the Evangelist would never have
concealed this reason, and mentioned another. Such a thing
as this I said was vented in a Manuscript, but I knew not that e∣ver
any print had maintained it. Now I am told that there is a
book in Folio entituled <HI>Baby Baptisme</HI> meere Babisme, that doth
assert it. If any man will trouble himself with the book or rea∣sons,
he may enjoy his liberty. He sayes the touch mentioned
was in order to healing, but I shall rather believe the Evange∣list
that referres it to blessing, <HI>Mark</HI> 10. 16.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>These were infants of such parents, that were in cove∣nant
with God, as appeares, in that Christ</HI> who now was in the
Coasts of <HI>Judea,</HI> was sent alone to them of <HI>Judea</HI> in covenant
with God, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15. 24. And was a Minister of the circum∣cision,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 15. And we see how facile he was to them, when
his carriage was otherwise, and of another sort: when a Ca∣naanitish
<PB N="395" REF="205"/>
woman comes for her child, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. 26. This further
appeares by that which they requested for these infants. This
seemes to be yielded, <HI>They came</HI> (saith one) <HI>to Christ upon the
conceit that he was a Prophet, and so they might bring children to
him to be blessed;</HI> and further sayes, if this reason prove any
thing, it is, that the childrens parents were Jewes, which is
all that we contend for, the Jewes as yet were in Covenant
with God. To this is said, <HI>if it be meant of all the Jewes, and
of the covenant of grace in Christ, it is palpably false, con∣tradictory
to the Apostles determination,</HI> Rom. 9. 7, 8. <HI>I</HI> am
sure, <HI>Rom,</HI> 9. 3, 4. Proves it to be above all contradiction true,
and that <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 7, 8. hath nothing against it, I have largely
shewed, which is past by in silence.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>These infants themselves were in covenant, and stood
in relation to Christ, bearing his name, and being of his people; and
were not as heathens in their present state without Christ; aliens
from the Common-Wealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant
of promise.</HI> This is evident by their free admission by Christ,
and the reason by him given, <HI>of such is the Kingdome of heaven.</HI>
After some personal reflections which <HI>I</HI> am resolved to wave, <HI>I</HI>
am told of the often complaint of the use of the word covenant,
in so various senses, or rather sometimes none-sense by the Pae∣dobaptists,
and again of their non-sense or proper gibberish,
which language <HI>I</HI> resolve to bear, being the least of many thou∣sands
that herein <HI>I</HI> suffer.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>They were admitted upon a common right equally be∣longing
to all infants of covenanting parents, and not by vertue of
any extraordinary priviledge peculiar to them, and not common to o∣thers.</HI>
This is plaine. 1. By the general admission which he
gives to infants on this occasion; <HI>suffer little children to come un∣to
me,</HI> and <HI>extraordinarium non facit regulam communem;</HI> Here
is a general rule, all have admission, and therefore there is no∣thing
extraordinary it is objected, <HI>these present infants onely were
admitted,</HI> but though one say it, me thinks another should not be
found to beleeve it, of such little ones is the Kingdome of hea∣ven,
therefore let these little ones come, and onely these. 2.
It was such a right that the Disciples of Christ ought to have un∣derstood,
as plainly appeares by Christs sore displeasure con∣ceived
against them, for forbidding their admission to him, and
<PB N="396" REF="206"/>
that must be a known right and not secret; One indeed sayes,
<HI>They were not admitted out of any known right common to others, but
a peculiar priviledge as being elected;</HI> for which <HI>Piscator</HI> is quo∣ted,
when as <HI>Piscator</HI> sylogistically concludes the contrary.
His evasion of this argument is very well worthy of animadver∣sion,
<HI>The reason of Christs anger was their hindring him in his de∣signe,
not the knowledge they had of their present visible title, this
is but a dream,</HI> afterwards he saith, <HI>the truth is, this thing was done
to these infants, not by reason of any visible title they had, or to en∣ter
them into any outward Church priviledge, but to accomplish by
his blessing their interest in the invisible Kingdom of God by election.
I</HI> would demand whether the Disciples did understand Christs
designe, or whether they were bound to know it, or were their
sinne not to know it; whether they knew these infants to be e∣lect,
or whether they were bound to know their election? Nei∣ther
of these having any ground (election being of the secrets
of heaven, and Christ had not made known any such designe)
Christ who condemnes anger without a cause as a breach of the
sixth commandment, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> 5. 22. would not himself have been an∣gry,
where there could be no sin the alone just ground of anger. It
is now confest that the Disciples of Christ ought to have under∣stood
that they were to be admitted; but it was, <HI>either be∣cause
they heeded not some particular intimation of his mind concern∣ing
those infants, or some general truth concerning Christs office,
and his readinesse to do good to all sorts of persons, as there was opper∣tunity
offered, from which he ought not to be hindred by them,</HI>
when Christ himself assigns an open known reason, of such little
ones is the Kingdome of heaven, they that will may heed oppo∣site
conjectural reasons. It is confest that elect infants might
be baptized were they known; but in this case Christ may be as
sore displeased at mens non-baptizing elect ones, as he was at
his Disciples for forbidding the admission of these little ones.
And let them take heed upon this account lest they suffer more
from Christs displeasure in not admitting elect infants to Bap∣tisme,
than they can imagine that we shall suffer in the Baptisme
of those that are not elected. <HI>I</HI> am told that <HI>I</HI> have <HI>just cause
to fear the displeasure of Christ for admitting to Baptisme those that
are neither known to be elect, nor beleevers, but infants of parents,
who are manifestly children of the devil, covenant breakers.</HI> If they
<PB N="397" REF="206"/>
be covenant-breakers as is here confest, then they are covenant∣ers,
for none out of covenant breakes covenant; and <HI>I</HI> here pro∣fesse
that <HI>I</HI> will baptize none of whom <HI>I</HI> have not all assurance
that they are the children of God. As to that Adoption which
is to the inheritance of priviledges, as those were,
<HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 20.</P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>They are here admitted by our Saviour Christ to a
Church-priviledge, proper to Church-members, the Israel of God;</HI>
They are admitted to a blessing, <HI>Mar.</HI> 10. 16. Blessing is a
Church-priviledge, <HI>Num.</HI> 6. 22 23, &amp;c. to the end of the Chap∣ter,
<HI>The Lord spake unto Moses saying, speak unto Aaron and his
sonnes, saying, on this wise ye shall blesse the children of Israel, say∣ing
unto them, the Lord blesse thee and keep thee,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And they
shall put my Name upon the children of Israel, and I will blesse them.</HI>
They are therefore admitted to a Church-priviledge; the <HI>Israel</HI>
of God are under the blessing, little ones are ordered to receive
this blessing, little ones therefore are of <HI>Israel.</HI> The Lords por∣tion
is his people, <HI>Jacob</HI> is the lot of his inheritance, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 9.
These are the blessed of the Lord upon this account, <HI>Jerem.
31. 23. As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah, and
in the Cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The
Lord blesse thee O habitation of justice, and mountain of holinesse.</HI>
Children are within this number, they are the heritage of the
Lord, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 127. 3. and consequently admitted by our Saviour
Christ to this priviledge of a blessing. The Authour that char∣ges
non-sense and gibberish on Paedobaptists in general, there
tells his Reader, that my arguing is as though my wits went on
wool-gathering, because <HI>I</HI> was not mindful to put my argument
into an explicite sylogistical form, but now it is done for his sa∣tisfaction; blessing is a priviledge of the <HI>Israel</HI> of God, <HI>Numb.</HI> 6.
23. 27. Christ admits infants to a blessing. Therefore he ad∣mits
them to a priviledge of the <HI>Israel</HI> of God or Church-priviledge.
It is objected that Christ admits onely a few, but
it is with a reason that gives admission to others of such is the
Kingdome of heaven. A great triumph is made of a speech of
mine, <HI>page</HI> 91. of my answer, where I say we do not think that
this blessing was baptising, or that these desired, or that Christ
intended their baptisme; onely we affirme that a <HI>medium</HI> hence
may be taken▪ from whence we may inferre the right of infants
<PB N="398" REF="207"/>
to baptisme; They that are admitted to one Church-priviledg,
may not be denyed another, whereof they are equally capable;
But infants are here admitted and order taken for their admissi∣on
to one Church-priviledge, of which they are no otherwise
capable than of Baptisme; so that here is no direct precedent
for baptisme in particular, but for Church-priviledges of which
infants are capable. None that are interessed in the Church of
Christ which is his Kingdome may be denied an admission to it
by Baptisme. A ground it is, not immediate expresse, but by
necessary consequence. Observation is made, <HI>Mark this speech,
if [but] be adversative, then he grants that infants are capable
of Church-priviledges; not of Baptisme, which overthrowes all
his dispute.</HI> But that is left out which would fully explaine my
meaning, and wholly take off the force of his reply. This act
of Christ is no direct precedent for Baptisme in particular, but
of Church-priviledges in general. If he can but assume and
make good with our <HI>Socinian Antibaptists</HI> (who in the parts
where I live, begin to triumph over <HI>Antipaedobaptists,</HI> beating
them down with their own weapons) that Baptisme is no
Church-priviledge; then <HI>I</HI> shall confesse, that he hath wrested
this argument out of my hands, and that this text as to this ar∣gument
falls, otherwise it is of force and an undeniable conse∣quence.
I am now told, that, <HI>if this act of Christs be a direct
precept</HI> (I intended precedent) <HI>of Church-priviledges in general,
then it is of Baptisme in particular, being a Church-priviledge, that
which is said of the Genus, being true (as Logicians say) of the</HI> spe∣cies,
quicquid praedicatur de genere, praedicatur de specie.
<HI>Whence it followes, he speaks inconsistencies.</HI> But he should have
taken in all my words [immediate expresse] as well as [direct]
and <HI>I</HI> think he that speakes of the <HI>Genus</HI> doth not immediately,
directly, and expresly speak of the <HI>species.</HI> But if it be otherwise,
and that herein I was mistaken, I am here content to retract it,
and confesse now, with help of this new light, that there is an
expresse, immediate, direct precedent for infant-Bap∣tisme.</P>
<P>Concerning the reason given of admission of infants in that
proposition of Christs, <HI>Of such is the Kingdome of heaven:</HI> We
have 1. The subject, <HI>of such.</HI> 2. The predicate or attribute,
<HI>is the Kingdome of Heaven.</HI> The particle <HI>such</HI> cannot here have
<PB N="399" REF="207"/>
reference to their qualification: that those that were qualified as
these, in humility, and meeknesse, had their interest; Sheep
and Doves as well as infants, are thus qualified. They are not
proud, nor revengeful. That which the Disciples took to be an
impediment of force to hinder infants, and a just ground of re∣buke
of those that brought them, is that which Christ under∣stands
in this reproof of the Disciples, and admission of their
infants; But it was their want of growth, their littlenesse,
which the Disciples took to be a just impediment, and which oc∣casioned
their reproof: So that the particle <HI>[such]</HI> hath di∣rect
reference to the quantity (as I may say) not to the quality
of these infants, to their infant-stature, or minority not to their
meeknesse or humility. And so it is referred else-where ex∣pressely
by our Saviour himself; <HI>Who so shall receive one such lit∣tle
child,</HI> Matth. 18. 5. the word is the same here, and there, it
respects littlenesse therefore, and not meeknesse. The whole
Text may be thus fitly parathrased; Trouble not our Master
with such as these, say the Disciples, there is no use of their com∣ing,
they need not his cure, and they are not capable of his in∣struction,
they have no infirmity to be healed, no capacity to be
taught; It is fit for men of abler parts, not for infants to make
their addresse to him, <HI>Let them come,</HI> saith our Saviour, <HI>and
let not their infant-age exclude them, how little soever they are
capable of the Kingdome of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>For the predicate or attribute, <HI>the Kingdome of heaven:</HI> This
as is said, is meant of the Kingdome of Glory; and on this hinge
(as is further said) the answer to the whole Argument turnes.
The Author therefore assumes his affirmation, and saith; <HI>I de∣termine
the Kingdome of Heaven to be meant of the Kingdome of
Glory,</HI> and gives his reasons. To encounter with this con∣fident
assault of his, I shall undertake these three par∣ticulars.</P>
<P>1. To make it appear that the hinge of the whole hangs not
here.</P>
<P>2. That in his reasons given are nothing satisfacto∣ry,
to evince that it must be meant of the Kingdome of
Glory.</P>
<P>3. That in case it were granted him, yet it doth not at all ad∣vantage
the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="208"/>
First, That all hangs not on this, appeares, in that our Savi∣our
had said enough in his order for admission of these infants,
on which we can build our conclusion. Those that are admitted
to Church-priviledges, they are Church-members; But infants are
admitted by our Saviour Christ to Church-priviledges, and ther∣fore
are Church-members. However Master <HI>Tombes</HI> can inter∣pret
the reason, yet he cannot deny Christs order for their ad∣mission,
nor deny that it was a Church-priviledge to which they
are admitted. To illustrate it by a parallel. The Apostle sayes,
1 <HI>Cor. 11. 10. The woman ought to have power on her head, because
of the Angels.</HI> The womans duty is there cleare, to be covered
in token of subjection, though we do not agree what is meant
by Angels; Whether Angels of Glory, or Gods Ministers in the
Congregations that are called Angels of Churches; our duty is
as plain to give infants admittance as Church-members, though
the reason annext remaines controverted; Whether Gods King∣dome
on Earth, or the Kingdome in Glory be here meant by the
Kingdome of Heaven.</P>
<P>Secondly, For his Reasons (which though I should yield, the
cause is already gained) there is not force in them.</P>
<P>1. Saith he, <HI>The Kingdome of God must be understood,</HI> Mark 10.
14. <HI>as it is</HI> vers. 15. <HI>and</HI> Luke 18. 16. <HI>as</HI> vers. 17. <HI>and</HI> Matth. 19.
14. <HI>as it is in both those; This is proved, because our Saviour from
their estate, inferres a likenesse to them in others for the same estate,</HI>
Apolog p. 150. This Argument what colour soever it carries,
yet it is not conclusive. It may be taken more largely in Christs
argumentation, and in a more restrained sense in his words of
Instruction or Application, as in a place much parallel I shall
shew, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 1, 2. There we have the Apostles reproof, <HI>vers.</HI> 1.
and his reason, <HI>vers.</HI> 2. as in the Evangelists we have Christs
assertion confirming his reproof, <HI>ver.</HI> 14. and his application,
<HI>ver.</HI> 15. Now Saint, in the Apostles reproof is taken more larg∣ly,
than it is taken in his reason. A visible Saint is meant in
the first place, a real and glorified Saint in the second; visible
Saints may judge in small matters, for real Saints in glory shall
judge the world, shall judge Angels; and so it may be here,
infants have their present title to the visible Kingdome; and
men qualified as infants, shall only enter the Kingdome of Glo∣ry.
His second reason, that Christ directs his speech to the Dis∣ciples
<PB N="401" REF="208"/>
already in the visible Church, and therefore speaks not of
the Church visible, I know not how to make up into a reason; If
I understood it, I would either yield or answer it. The third
reason, that the speech, <HI>Mark 10. 15 Luke</HI> 18. 17. is like <HI>Mat.</HI>
18. 3, 4. but there it is meant of the Kingdome of Glory; <HI>Ergo,</HI>
so here is answered already. If <HI>Mark 10. 15. Luke</HI> 18. 17. be
like <HI>Matth.</HI> 18 3, 4. yet <HI>Mark 10. 14. Luke</HI> 18. 16. which we
have in question; is unlike to <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 3, 4.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Were it granted him, that the Kingdome of Glory
must be understood both in Christs reason and application, yet he
is nothing holpen. Infants have right to the Church visible mi∣litant,
because they are in a capacity of entrance into the Church
triumphant, <HI>Acts 2. 47. The Lord added to the Church daily such
as should be saved;</HI> Not necessarily saved, but now (having en∣tered
Covenant with God) they were in a capacity, and therefore
added as visible Church-members. Infants standing in this ca∣pacity,
ought to have admission likewise. It is said, <HI>that if this
proposition were granted, that they have right to the Church visible
militant who shall be of the Church triumphant, yet this right can∣not
be claimed but by those who are elect, and therefore from these
Scriptures so expounded, it cannot be proved that any other than e∣lect
infants are to be baptized.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If election or non-election must steere us in admission
to Baptisme this were to purpose interposed, but when there is
nothing that can be objected against them as hindring their sal∣vation
it is sufficiently proved that it may not hinder their Bap∣tisme.
That must not be pleaded against any as a barre to hin∣der
their admission into the Church on earth that will not hinder
their admission into the Church in heaven.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reasons evincing the Birth-priviledge and Covenant-holinesse
of the issue of Beleevers.</HEAD>
<P>HAving already so largely insisted upon by Scripture proofs,
that children are in covenant with parents, and that privi∣ledges
of Ordinances (which necessarily imply a covenant) do
<PB N="402" REF="209"/>
descend to posterity, <HI>I</HI> shall lay down certain grounds; some of
them making way towards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covenant-in∣terest is of the nature of those things that de∣scend from pa∣rent to child.</NOTE> and others necessarily inferring of
themselves the conclusion.</P>
<P>First, This is of the nature of those things which descend from
Parent to childe, from Ancestors to Posterity, which is in their
power to convey to their issue. There are those things indeed
which are personally inherent in men, and proper to them, so
that they cannot convey them to their issue; there is no deriving
of them to others by succession. As, 1. Individual accidents
of the body, wounds, scarres, or comelinesse of feature, these
are so in the Parent, that they are not conveyed to their chil∣dren.
2. Habits, or proper gifts; whether acquired by pains,
or infused. The son of a learned man inherits not his fathers
gifts; The son of an Artificer is no such Artist; The son of a
Prophet hath not by vertue of birth the gift of prophecy; nor
is the son of a regenerate man endowed with saving grace for
that reason.</P>
<P>There are on the contrary those things that passe from Parent
to childe, which the Parent by nature or special priviledge hath
power to convey. As, 1. The essential or integral part of a <HI>Spe∣cies,</HI>
with the natural properties that do accompany it; so one
brute beast brings forth another, one brid brings for another, and
man brings forth one of mankind. 2. The priviledges or burdens,
which in Family or Nation are hereditary, they are conveyed from
Parents to Posterity, from Ancestors to their issue; As is the Fa∣ther,
so is the child, as respecting these particulars. This none have
questioned, and these things in hand being of the same nature,
it is a faire propable ground of it self (if evidence to the con∣trary
from Scripture be not cleare) that they are thus still trans∣mitted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Like privi∣ledges do de∣scend in King∣domes, Com∣mon-weales, Cities, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Secondly, It is so in Kingdomes, Common-wealths, Cities,
in Corporations, Families; The son of a Noble man is Noble,
of a Free-man, is Free, <HI>Acts</HI> 22. 28. As the sonne of a bond-man
(where by the Law of Nations they are bond men) is a
bond-man likewise, <HI>Exod.</HI> 21. 4. Now we know that in Scri∣pture
the Church of God is frequently stiled by these names;
By the most honourable of them, <HI>Mat. 8. 11, 12. Mat.
21. 43. Ephes. 2. 19. Hebrewes 12. 22. Ephesians</HI> 3. 15. to
let us understand, that as Cities, Kingdomes, Families, have
<PB N="403" REF="209"/>
their priviledges; so the people of God in covenant have theirs
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ikewise.</P>
<P><HI>But we are told,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> You do very carnally imagine the Church of
God to be like civil Corporations, as if persons were admitted
to it by birth; whereas in this all is done by free Election of
grace, and according to Gods appointment; nor is God tied, or
doth tie himself in the erecting and propagating his Church, to a∣ny
such carnal respects as descent from men: Christianity is no mans

<HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Beza</HI> have drawn their opinion of a birth-righteousnesse,
and say, that the children of Beleevers are holy, and saved without
Baptisme; because on this account that they are Beleevers children,
they are reputed to be born in the Church, within that Divine co∣venant;
I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. As
children in the civil Law are accounted free, whose parents are ei∣ther
of them free; but (<HI>saith he</HI>) they are deceived, <HI>and gives his
reason;</HI> The Church is not a civil Common-wealth, but superna∣tural;
and there is no man born a Christian, but spiritually new
borne, and is made holy; not civilly, but really, by faith, hope and
charity infused into the soul. <HI>So</HI> Stapleton <HI>on the same words in
his</HI> Antidotum, (<HI>applying the</HI> Spiritual Antidote <HI>against</HI> Calvins

set forth, Jesuites contradict it, and upon this account it
is a carnal imagination to conceive it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="210"/>
The Apostle knew not (<HI>saith one</HI>) that God had so by promise,<MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> or
other engagement bound himself; but he was free as he said to <HI>Moses</HI>
after the promise made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to have mercy on whom he
would, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 15.</P>
<P>If this be meant of any engagement of God to confer saving
graces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> or habitual qualifications on the natural seed of Beleevers,
the words then carry reason with them. But neither he nor his
great friends will learn, to distinguish between Gods conditional
covenant (contained in priviledges of Ordinances) and habitual
saving graces, otherwise they know from <HI>Moses,</HI> that God exer∣cised
this freedome in making choise of <HI>Israel</HI> above all Nations,
and that the Apostle knew, and in the same Chapter lets us know,
<HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. that to them pertained the covenants, and that this
was their prerogative for Birth-priviledge, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 1. We say
the son of a Free-man is Free, the son of a Noble-man is Noble;
we never said that the son of a Learned-man is Learned; we say
that the son of a Christian is a Christian, as to interest in Ordi∣nances;
We never said that the son of a Regenerate man is Re∣generate.</P>
<P><HI>It is further urged,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If this were true that the covenant of Grace
is a birth-right-priviledge, then the children of Beleevers are chil∣dren
of Grace by nature; for that which is a birth-right-priviledge,
is a priviledge by nature. And if Christianity is hereditary, that
as the child of a Nobleman is Noble, the child of a Free-man is Free,
the child of a Turk is a Turk, of a Jew a Jew, the child of a Christian
is a Christian, Then Christians are born Christians, and not made
Christians, and how are they then children of wrath by nature; which
whether it may not advantage the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> and deniers of Original

<P>To this I answer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE> It concernes those that presse these ob∣jections,

then they have an answer. The Apostle was by birth of the peo∣ple
of God in covenant, and yet by nature a childe of wrath.</P>
<P><HI>It is further said,</HI><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> To conceive that it is in Gods Churches as in o∣ther
Kingdomes, and after the Lawes of Nations, is a seminary of
dangerous superstitions and errours.</P>
<P>It is well that they have learned an Artifice from these<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE>
<PB N="405" REF="210"/>
superstition-hating Jesuites, to keep out the inlet of superstition
among us: if there were no parallel held betwixt the Church of
God and other Kingdomes, after the manner of the Law of Na∣tions,
but such that are Seminaries of superstition; they may
do well to acquaint us how it comes to passe, that the Curch in
Scripture hath the name of a City, Family, Kingdome? Simi∣litudes
ever carry some resemblance. If this were the alone
ground, on which the Birth-priviledge of Christians were bot∣tomed,
they had said something; but being only an illustration
of it, and nothing more, they are over lavish in their censure.
Similitudes indeed may be over-stretched beyond their reach, and
if they had laid down rules to declare where the Similitude
holds, and where it holds not (as I have done in the Birth-privi∣ledge)
and made it appear that it holds not in that for which I
produce it, they had said somewhat to the purpose; Read <HI>Mal.</HI>
1. 6, 8, 14. and tell me whether there be any ground laid for dan∣gerous
superstitions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth-interest descends in all other Religions</NOTE></P>
<P>Thirdly, It is so in all other Religions, they keep up their pri∣viledge
of interest in the worship of their Ancestors. The childe
of a Turke is a Turke, the childe of a Pagan is a Pagan, the child
of a Jew is a Jew: And it is the Apostles Argument in like case

<P><HI>Fourthly, God ownes children born in the Church as by birth
his, his servants,</HI> Levit. 25. 39, 40, 41, 42. If thy brother that
dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not
compel him to serve as a bond-servant, but as an hired servant, and
as a sojourner he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year
of Jubile. And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his chil∣dren
with him; and shall return unto his own family, and unto the pos∣session
of his fathers shall he returne; For they are my servants.
<HI>Root and Branch, Parent and childe are servants of God; As
they were the servants of their Master; when they could do them
<PB N="406" REF="211"/>
actually no service, by reason of their relation to them; so they
are the servants of God on the same account. And as he owns
them as his servants, so also he ownes them as by birth his chil∣dren,
Ezek.</HI> 16. 20, 21. Moreover, thou hast taken thy sonnes and
thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sa∣crificed
unto them to be devoured; Is this of thy Whoredomes a small
matter, That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to
cause them to passe through the fire for them? <HI>If there were no
Birth-priviledge, how had God this property in Infants? and
this</HI> David <HI>pleads,</HI> Ps. 116. 16. O Lord, I am thy servant, truly
I am thy servant, and the son of thy hand-maid; <HI>because he was
borne in Gods house, and was a childe of a servant of his; he
pleads his interest.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parent and childe respe∣ctive to Church-inter∣est, are not in an opposite condition.</NOTE> If the child be not in covenant, the parent and childe
are heterogeneal, and respective to Church-relation in the most
opposite condition: the Parent in the Kingdom of God by vertue
of the faith that he professes: the childe in the Kingdome of
Satan by reason of his non-interest in the Promise, and want of
title to Covenant-relation. But Scripture makes them still as
one, Jewes children are Jewes by nature, Gentiles children are
sinners, that is, Gentiles by nature. The Root being holy, the
Branches are holy; Parents not sanctified, children are unclean;
but Parents being sanctified, they are holy.</P>
<P>Sixthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No president in Scripture, of a believing Pa∣rent bringing up a childe for covenant and not in cove∣nant.</NOTE> If children be not taken into Covenant with their pa∣rents,
then the most godly of Parents bring up children; not in
covenant, but for a covenant; not in any present interest of re∣lation
to God, but at best in an hopeful expectation of it. They
bring not forth children to God, but at best they have their de∣sires
to traine them for such a future visible relation; But there is
no such example in all Scripture of a parent in covenant, train∣ing
up the seed of their bodies for a covenant. No one in all
New Testament-Scripture, ever bred up a childe in yeares to ba∣ptize
him, no more than in Old Testament-Scriptures they bred
their children to circumcise them; we read of many baptized in
years, but we read of none borne of Christian parents, kept till
yeares of discretion to be baptized.—</P>
<P>Seventhly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infants out of covenant ac¦cording to Scripture-grounds are without hope of salvation.</NOTE> If children be not received into covenant with
their parents, but stand without covenant, and in no right of
Church-membership, then they are without any Scripture-ground
<PB N="407" REF="211"/>
of hope of salvation, then they are as all others that are out of
covenant; <HI>without Christ, without God, without hope.</HI> And be∣cause
some have risen up against this Argument with high cla∣mours,
though hitherto with feeble, or rather no reasons, I
shall somewhat more enlarge my self in confirmation of it. That
which the prime authours of, and chiefest sticklers for, the non-federation
of infants freely confesse, which the general consent
of their adversaries (Protestant Writers) unanimously upon Scri∣pture
grounds conclude, that the present Patrons can maintain
with nothing but clamours, and such reasons (improved to the
highest) which will equally conclude the hopes of the greatest
Drunkards, Idolaters, Adulterers, Heathens; that must be taken
for an Argument of force, and a reason conclusive this cannot be
denyed; But so it is here, as I shall make good in several parti∣culars.</P>
<P>1. Those of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jesuites our leading adver∣saries confesse it.</NOTE> that have stood up against
Infants covenant-holinesse, do confesse that all infants going out
of the world as they came into the world, in that estate perish,
and so have provided a chamber in hell, which they call by the
name of <HI>Limbus Infantum,</HI> and now since their <HI>Limbus Patrum</HI>
by Christs death is made empty by the fetching out all that were
there in expectation of him, and the number of infants thus dy∣ing
increasing, it is said by some that these two are laid together:
howsoever it falls out with these places about which we have no
reason to busie our selves, this position that infants thus dying
without any covenant, or Church-interest, do perish, followes as
directly from their principles as any conclusion from its pre∣mises.</P>
<P>2. Protestant Divines who assert Infant-salvation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Protestant Di∣vines cannot a∣void it.</NOTE> and be∣leeve
no such division of hell into chambers, and have other
thoughts of the condition of Infants, still bring this interest of
theirs in the covenant of God as their ground, (not prying into
the secrets of Election, nor urging prerogative above that which
is written) the covenant of God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7. confirmed by the
New Testament-Scriptures before mentioned. They very well
know, that in case Papists can wrest this covenant-interest of
infants from them, they conclude according to Scripture-ground
their damnation: <HI>Luke</HI> tells us, there were daily added to the
Church such as should be saved, namely to the Church visible,
<PB N="408" REF="212"/>
as the Text is clear, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 47. Now if they stand not admitible
into the Church, they stand without hope of salvation; see how
the Apostle joynes these together, <HI>Ephes. 2. 12. Without Christ,
being aliens from the Common-wealth of</HI> Israel, <HI>and strangers from
the Covenants of Promise, having no hope, and without God in the
world.</HI> If any can conclude against the interest of any in the
Common-wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> that is, the Church of God, and
the covenants of promise (which those do that will have them
to be no Church-members, nor to be taken into covenant with
Parents) they sadly doome them to be <HI>without Christ, without
God, without Hope.</HI> Those that disclaime <HI>Zuinglius</HI> his opinion,
that <HI>Hercules, Socrates, Aristides, Numa,</HI> and such like Hea∣thens
are now in heaven; would be desired to shew how they
cast those out, upon that account as Heathens, and take in infants
as great strangers (according to them) to any Church-interest.
Infants want not sin for condemnation; our first Original
estate being a corrupt estate, and by nature children of wrath,
and putting them out of covenant, they can finde no Scripture-way
to entitle them to Christ for redemption; They seeme to
conceive other hopes of the salvation of infants of Heathens,
that upon the same ground they may be charitable to the infants
of Christians, that with them are in the same posture with Hea∣thens,
when they speak of <HI>Hercules</HI> and other Heathens as be∣fore;
yet speaking of the infants of Heathens, they say, <HI>It is
bad to say, that God doth not save some of the infants of Indians</HI> pro
bene placito, <HI>according to his good pleasure.</HI> For any warrant we
can finde in Scripture, it is as bad to say it of the parent as of the
childe. The Scriptures leave the whole of the Family, root
and branch under the fury and wrath of God▪ <HI>Jeremiah 10. 25.
Psal.</HI> 79. 6.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our present adversaries in∣stead of reasons oppose onely comers against it.</NOTE></P>
<P>3. The present Patrons of this non-federation of infants, can
maintaine their salvation with nothing but clamours, and such
reasons improved to the highest, that equally conclude the sal∣vation
of the greatest drunkards, adulterers, idolaters, Hea∣thens;
I shall now purposely for peace sake passe by those high
clamors and bitter invectives that we meet with on this occasi∣on,
and come to take notice of the reasons produced, to exempt
infants from this doom of condemnation, and all that I can find
is one and the same thing to fly for refuge to prerogative; <HI>This
<PB N="409" REF="212"/>
is my judgement</HI> (saith one) <HI>that God will have us to suspend our
judgment of this matter, and Rest on the Apostles determination,</HI>
Rom. 9. 18. For satisfaction of which I need to adde no more
than what I have said, <HI>page</HI> 15. of my Answer, seeing it rests, &amp; not
one word yet replied to it. The Text of Scripture (which we
have over and over) is, <HI>that God will have mercy on whom he will
have mercy,</HI> telling his adversary, <HI>that it is bad to say that God doth
not save</HI> pro bene placito, which no adversary of his will deny,
But God is pleased in his Word to make known the way of the dis∣pensation
of his mercy, otherwise the vilest person against whom
in our ministerial way, we denounce Gods judgments▪ may reply
that his hope of salvation is as good as the best, for God saves <HI>ex
bene placito,</HI> and hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
the best soul, in a case of disertion, will take off all his applicati∣ons
of comfort, with the close of that Scripture, <HI>And whom he will
he hardeneth,</HI> Rom. 9. 18. And so the Jews even in their rejection,
(of which the Apostle speaks so largely,) being cut off by unbe∣lief,
might have pleaded their hope of salvation, as well as in a be∣leeving
condition; we must therefore not look to the secret Will
of God, of which no reason can be given, but his good pleasure;
but into his revealed Will, where he is pleased to make known the
dispensation of this will and good pleasure of his, and so we shall
learn not to carry our hopes beyond his promise. To that Text of
the Apostle, <HI>Eph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 12. In which all out of Covenant are con∣cluded
to be with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, It is said, <HI>Though the Gentiles were
without hope,</HI> Eph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 12. <HI>in respect of the body of them, yet now and
then, God called some, as</HI> Rahab, <HI>out of the visible Church, and there∣fore
we may not determine universally that out of the visible Church
there is no salvation at all.</HI> But when <HI>Rahab</HI> was thus called she was
no more a Gentile, as appears, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 11. as the Ephesians had
been, but in present were no Gentiles, so also it was with her, nei∣ther
she, nor they, were saved out of the Church; but brought into
the Church for salvation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Corollary for Infants Baptism.
Infant-Baptism by Arguments asserted.</HEAD>
<P>THen it follows by way of necessary Corollary, that Infants
have right to Baptism, children of baptized parents are en∣titled
to that Ordinance.</P>
<P>First, those that have been Church-members, and admitted with
the initiating sign and seal, are yet to be admitted, unlesse order
be given to the contrary; But Infants have been Church-members,
and accordingly admitted by the initiating sign and seal, neither
is there any order for the contrary; Therefore Infants are
Church-membes, and still to be admitted.</P>
<P>Secondly, Those that are under the Covenant-promises of God
with the body of his people, have right to Baptism, <HI>Acts.</HI> 2. 39.
But Infants are under the Covenant-promises of God with the
body of his people; Infants therefore have right to Baptism.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Saints, or holy persons have right to Baptism: Infants
are Saints, they are holy persons, <HI>Rom. 11. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor.</HI> 7. 14. Infants
therefore have right to Baptism.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They that by birth according to the flesh, are in the
bosome of the Church, have right to Baptism: But Infants by
birth according to the flesh are in the bosome of the Church, <HI>Gal.</HI>
4. 29. Infants therefore ought to be baptized.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They that are admitted to Church-priviledges have
right to Baptism, the leading priviledge; But Infants are admitted
to Church-priviledges, <HI>Mark 10. 14. Matth. 19. 14. Luke</HI> 18. 16.
Infants therefore have right to Baptism.</P>
<P>Sixtly, The children of the Kingdome, that with others make
up the Kingdome of God, have right to Baptism; But Infants are
the children of the Kingdome, that with others make up the
Kingdome of God, <HI>Mark 10. 14. Matth. 19. 14. Luke</HI> 18. 16.
Infants therefore have right to Baptism.</P>
<P>Seventhly, The heritage of the Lord are to be admitted to Ba∣ptism:
<PB N="411" REF="213"/>
But Infants are the heritage of the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 127. 3. there∣fore
Infants are to be admitted to baptism.</P>
<P>Eightly, Those that are to be saved, are to be added to the
Church by baptism, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 47. Infants are to be saved, and there∣fore
are to be added to the Church by Baptism.</P>
<P>In all of these Syllogismes the minor is at large confirmed in
the discourse before going, the major in each shall pre∣sently
be at large confirmed, and so the conclusion will be
undenyable.</P>
<P>Here it is objected with no small noise, that Infant-baptisme
wants an institution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections against Infants Baptism answe∣red.</NOTE> we find no command for it in all New Te∣stament-Scripture,
where our warrant alone is for New Testa∣ment-Ordinances.
Neither have we any example in the New Te∣stament
of an Infant baptized; whatsoever then our Arguments
are, this concludes it to be without warrant. To speak to these,
and first to the institution.</P>
<P>The institution spoken to in this objection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Question stated whether there be any institution of Infant-Ba∣ptism.</NOTE> either is an institu∣tion
of the Ordinance of Baptism it self; or else an institution
with limit to Infant-age; For Baptism it self they will not deny
that we have warrant in the New Testament; <HI>John</HI> was sent to ba∣ptize
in the Nation of the Jews, <HI>John</HI> 1. 33. and the Apostles have
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commission <HI>Matth. 28. 19. to baptize all Nations.</HI> For an in∣stitution
with limit to Infant-age; we heard but even now there
was no institution in the Old Testament for Infant-Circumcision.
The institution <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 10. is for males without limit in respect of
growth: I am sure it cannot be affirmed that there is any institu∣tion
of Baptism in the New Testament, with limit to any deter∣minate
age or growth. This ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection if it have force in it, fol∣lowed
home, will overthrow all Baptism at any age, and every
other New Testament-Ordinance whatsoever. Suppose a man of
20, 25, 30, 40, 50. years of age seeketh Baptism. According to this
rule, he must bring a prescript for one of this age to be baptized,
and the same also for the Lords Supper. But it is replied, <HI>Beleevers
of any age may be baptized, beleeve, and the age is not regarded.</HI> This
will be easily yielded, if they be not already baptized, but then the
<PB N="412" REF="214"/>
institution with limit to Infancy is waved; and upon the same ac∣count
Church-Members in Covenant of any age, ought to be ba∣ptized,
and so the institution is not in question about that there is
an agreement. But whether Infants be in Covenant, or whether
they be any Church-Members, is to be disputed, which already is
satisfied.</P>
<P>2. I say those words of our Saviour. <HI>Matth. 28. 19. Disciple all
Nations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Infants are within the verge of the institution of Baptisme.</NOTE> <HI>baptizing them, &amp;c.</HI> do comprize Infants in them as well
as men of years; Infants serving to make up a Nation as well as
Parents. The Infants of <HI>Nineveh</HI> did make a considerable party
of the City of <HI>Nineveh.</HI> The Infants of any Nation make up a
part of the Nation, and the Nation where they came was to be
discipled, and baptized. And that Infants are here comprehend∣ed,
farther appears by this Argument.</P>
<P>In the same sense and latitude as Nation was taken in respect
of the Covenant of God, when the Covenant and Covenant-initiating
Sacrament was restrained to that one onely Nation,
where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r commission was first limited; In the same sense it is
to be taken (unlesse the Text expresse the contrary) now the
commission is enlarged. This cannot be denyed of any that will
have the Apostles to be able to know Christs meaning, by his
words in this enlarged commission: But Nation then (as is
confessed) did comprehend all in the Nation in respect of the
Covenant, and nothing is expressed in the Text to the contrary;
therefore it is to be taken in that latitude to comprehend Infants.
This Argument hath strength from that of the Apostle, <HI>Acts 3.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. Yea are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which
God made with our fathers, saying unto</HI> Abraham, <HI>and in thy seed
shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</HI> As it was with the kin∣dred
of <HI>Abraham</HI> in respect of Covenant-holinesse; so it is with
all kindreds of the earth, they joyntly make one party in the
Covenant But Infants of <HI>Abrahams</HI> kindred were in the Cove∣nant,
and of the Nation, in respect of Covenant-blessednesse.</P>
<P><HI>But it will be said, that</HI> an exception of Infants is implied, in that
all of the Nation must be discipled before they be baptized: But In∣fants
are not capable of being discipled; and so they are made unca∣pable
of Baptism.</P>
<P>I answer. 1. Here is implied that they are of capacity to be
Disciples, in that Christ sends to disciple Nations, and they serve
to make up the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="214"/>
2. It is the way of Scripture-speaking of an universality of a
people in a Land, expressely to except Infants in case they be to be
excepted, as we see in the judgement that befell <HI>Israel</HI> in the wil∣dernesse,
to the cutting off of those that came out of the Land of
<HI>Egypt, Numb.</HI> 14. 38. And in the Covenant entered by the body
of the Nation of all degrees and sexes at their returne from
<HI>Babylon, Nehem.</HI> 10. 28. and an exception could be no where
more useful and necessary than there; to let us know that it is o∣therwise
with Gentiles in this particular, then it was with the
Jewes, that the Nations where their commission thus enlarged,
were herein differenced from the Nation to which their Ministry
was first limited.</P>
<P>3. Let that Text of the Prophet be well weighed, where speak∣ing
by the Spirit of Prophecy of the rejection of the Jewes, and
the glorious call of the Gentiles in their stead (in that ample way
as it is there set out) he hath these words: <HI>Behold, I will lift up
my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people, and
they shall bring thy sonnes in their armes, and thy daughters shall be
carried upon their shoulders,</HI> Isa. 49. 22. If there were but such an
hint as that, by way of Prophecy, to have left them behinde, we
should from some, have heard of it with a noise.</P>
<P>4. In the Lord Christs own Dialect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infans are Disciples.</NOTE> who is best able to ex∣presse
his own meaning, they are Disciples. To belong to Christ
is to be a Disciple of Christ. This is plaine from our Saviours
own mouth, comparing his words recorded in <HI>Matthew</HI> and in
<HI>Mark, To give a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a Di∣sciple,</HI>
it is in the one, <HI>Matth. 10. 42. To give a cup of water to
drinke in my name, because ye belong to me,</HI> it is in the other,
<HI>Mark</HI> 9. 41. To belong to Christ, to be a Disciple of Christ,
and to bear the name of Christ is one and the same thing with
our Saviour. Now that infants are of the number of those who
as Disciples in Christs account do belong to him, and bear his
name, is yet farther plaine by another Text of Saint <HI>Matthew,
Matth.</HI> 18. 5. where Christ setting a little childe in the midst of
his hearers, saith, <HI>Whoso shall receive one such little childe in my
name, receiveth me.</HI> By all which it appeares, that which is done
to Infants, is done to Disciples, &amp; hath a glorious reward as done
to Disciples. Infants therefore are Disciples of Christ, are of
those that do belong unto him, and beare his name: Who then
<PB N="414" REF="215"/>
is not afraid to refuse them who will receive Christ? Who will
not baptize them that is willing to baptize Disciples in the name
of Christ?</P>
<P>For that part of the objection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The invalidity of that ob∣jection, that we have no ex∣ample of In∣fant-Baptisme examined.</NOTE> that there is no example in New
Testament-Scripture on infant-Baptisme. I answer.</P>
<P>First, For an example of Baptisme with limit to any one pre∣cise
number of years, or dayes; we have but one that I know (if
that) in Scripture, and that is of Christ, who was (as is computed)
about the age of thirty, when he was baptized, if this be prest
and followed, all must at that alone be for Baptisme, and no other
of any age may be baptized.</P>
<P>Secondly, There are many things of which we make no que∣stion,
and yet we have no example of them: I have instanced in the
trial of the suspected wife by the water of jealousie, that there is
no example for it in all the Old Testament-Scripture; and for wo∣mens
receiving of the Lords Supper, there is not a particular in∣stitution,
or any particular expresse precedent for it in the New
Testament; They cannot give us any instance of any one trained
up by believing Parents for Baptisme, and assoon as he could
give an account, baptized; not one childe of a Beleever brought
up for covenant, and not in covenant. One goes about to give
instance of particular precedents for womens receiving the Lords
Supper. 2. And instead of a precedent urges, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 28.
as an expresse command in formal termes for women, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
comprehending both Sexes. To this I have replied in my answer,
<HI>pag.</HI> 52. We are then furnished with an expresse command in
termes as formal, and with an example to boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of womens cir∣cumcision;
and so the difference between circumcision and Bap∣tisme
(so often laid in the dish of Paedobaptists) here falls to the
ground; <HI>Ye on the Sabbath-day do circumcise,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>a man,</HI>
John 7. 22. <HI>if</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>a man on the Sabbath-day receive circum∣cision,
that the Law of</HI> Moses <HI>should not be broken,</HI> John 7. 23.
Here is <HI>Moses</HI> his command, the Jewes practice, with Christs ap∣probation,
in the same comprehensive latitude in regard of both
Sexes, as in Saint <HI>Paul</HI> for receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper. And if arguments borrowed from Grammer use of
words, be of that force; you see what they have proved, As
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is taken in one Sacrament, so it is to be taken in another:
But in the Sacrament of circumcision it is limited to the male on∣ly,
<PB N="415" REF="215"/>
to which accords that Logick rule; <HI>Omne analogum stans
per se, stat pro famosiori analogato.</HI> To this is replyed that the
subject matter of the command as well as the Grammar use of
the word, proves females to be included, but then his expresse
formal command is lost, they are not exprest, but included, and
by consequence onely, which will not be denied. He farther sayes,
<HI>that</HI> 1 Cor. 10. 17. <HI>is an expresse command in formal termes of wo∣mens
receiving the Lords Supper; we being many, are one bread,
and one body, for we are partakers of one bread.</HI> I demand, whe∣ther
the Apostle speaks in the person of Christians, or in the per∣son
of women? not of women sure, for he takes in himself, and
he was a man, and then the formality of an expresse Example
falls. He brings <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 7. that <HI>the Disciples on the first day of
the week came together to break bread.</HI> Here is an example as ex∣presse
and formal, as the former. They cannot infallibly prove
by help of consequence, much lesse expressely, that there was
a woman there. At that night-meeting there might be none but
men, as at the first institution. It can never be an expresse
example till it be made to appear that none are Disciples but
women.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The examples that we have of a whole houshold, be∣ing
baptized; if some had them in hand, would be sufficiently
formal; but any thing will serve as an expresse proof, when they
have a mind to affirme it, and nothing will serve to evince it by
consequence, when they have a mind to deny it. But as Disci∣ples
are women, so families have children. There are Families
without children, and there are Disciples there are not women.
The commission is to disciple Nations, and baptize them. Pro∣vidence
hath happily ordered that Nations have been brought
in, and their Infants received to Baptisme. In the Primitive times
housholds were baptized, without mention of exclusion of chil∣dren,
in after-ages housholds have come in with their chil∣dren.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infants want of faith and re∣pentance, no impediments of their Ba∣ptisme.</NOTE> It is yet objected, <HI>Men must believe and be baptized,</HI>
Mark 16. 16. <HI>Repent and be baptized,</HI> Acts 2. 39. Infants can nei∣ther
beleeve, nor repent, therefore they may not be baptized;
and will it not as directly follow, that when they can neither be∣lieve
nor repent, they must be damned; let them frame an answer
to the one, and then they have answered both; That which will
<PB N="416" REF="216"/>
speak for them to receive them into heaven (notwithstanding
those Scriptures that threaten condemnation to men in unbelief
and impenitency,) will speak also, to receive them into the Church
by Baptisme.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The want of those expresse words, Infants ought to be ba∣ptized is no impediment of their Baptisme.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thirdly, Some say, <HI>Where is it said in so many words, infants
must be baptized? Bring us those words, we abhorre syllogismes and
consequences.</HI> To deale with them with their owne weapons;
Where is it said that Infants must not be baptized, where are
those words written? if they care not for our consequences, we
shall not care for theirs. They have answered. <HI>Negatives can∣not
be proved.</HI> To this we answer. 1. Where is that said? we
finde it no where in Scripture, that <HI>Negatives</HI> cannot be proved.
2. Christ proved <HI>Negatives,</HI> That himself was not a Spirit; <HI>A
Spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have,</HI> Luke 24. 39.
That God was not to be tempted, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 7. 3. if <HI>Negatives</HI>
cannot be proved, then <HI>Negatives</HI> are not to be believed, ours
is an <HI>Affirmative</HI> which they yield may be proved, theirs, is a
<HI>Negative</HI> which they say cannot be proved, we then have
the better of it, there is hope of proof on our side, theirs is
desperate.</P>
<P>To help the Reader in a word for the necessity of consequen∣ces:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Necessity of Scripture con∣sequence.</NOTE>
If those be fools that cannot gather consequences from Scri∣pture,
to settle their faith upon them, then much more those
that deny them; But such are fooles by our Saviours own testi∣mony,
that cannot gather consequences from Scripture to
settle their faith on them, <HI>Luke 24. 25, 26. O fools and slow of heart
to beleeve all that the Prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have
suffered these things, and to have entred into his glory?</HI> Those were
fools and dullards that did not beleeve from the Scriptures of
the Prophets, that Christ must suffer and enter unto glory. But
those words are no where in expresse words written: It is alone
by consequence from the Prophets words that we know them.
Somewhat I have spoken to those that reason in this sort,
lest they should be wise in their own conceit, I will have no
more to deal with them, lest I be thought to be like them.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquity is for Infant-Baptisme.</NOTE> There is a great flourish made by some, as though An∣tiquity
were against Infant-Baptisme, and famous flourishing
Churches never received it: In which some have taken much
pains, but never did men travel in a businesse to lesse purpose,
<PB N="417" REF="216"/>
as all may see that will take the pains to read what they have
wrote, and bring it home to that which lies upon their hand to
prove, which is, that Infant-Baptisme is not ancient, as is pre∣tended,
that there were some ages of the Church in which it was
not in use. In all of which search of theirs and help that they
have found from the greatest Antiquaries of the <HI>Socinian</HI> party,
no friends to the Baptism of infants, they cannot finde one Wri∣ter
of any kinde whatsoever, or wheresoever, from the day that
<HI>John</HI> baptized in <HI>Jordan,</HI> and in <HI>Aenon</HI> near <HI>Salom</HI> to this very
year, that hath said, and left on record, <HI>That there was no such
custome as Infant-Baptism in his dayes;</HI> and when so many have
expressely affirmed that the original, was from the Apostles, and
that no beginning of it in the Church can be found, till some one
appear in contradiction to assert the non-usage of it in his time,
let any indifferent Reader judge to what purpose all serves that
can be said. The primitive times had not musical instruments in
their congregations, they had not Altars, Images, they erect∣ed
not Temples to Saints, this we hear from Writers in their se∣veral
Ages, and in case they had not infant-Baptism (when the
Church of the Jewes had infant-circumcision, and the ancient,
made Baptisme to succeed circumcision) and never any one men∣tion
their non-usage of it, or give any reason concerning it, is a∣bove
a wonder, the prime argument to render this practice to be
of lower standing, than is pretended, is the silence of some Au∣thors
of ancient, who times in their workes (as is said) do not
mention it, as <HI>Ignatius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Athanasius,
Epiphanius,</HI> and <HI>Eusebius, if it had been known in their times, why
do they not once mention it?</HI> To this, much might be said. 1. E∣very
Writer doth not treat of all Subjects, nor deal in all Argu∣ments,
some have written in our age, and infant-Baptism is not
found in all their Writings, shall after-ages infer upon their si∣lence
that infant-Baptisme was not used in our times? 2. If some
Writers do not mention it, yet others in the same time, or neer
about, speak fully to it. 3. Master <HI>Marshal</HI> full proofs of it,
in several of the Authors that are said to be silent in it, as <HI>Clemens
Alexandrinus, Athanasius,</HI> and that in <HI>Epiphanius,</HI> that doth

Answer, and if he ingenuously confessed, that he craved the help
of some learned Antiquaries, it speakes but little ingenuity in
those that once and again upbraid him for it. I have put to the
adversaries seven Queries concerning the practice of antiquity a∣bout
Infant-Bapti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, with some Observations also about it, in
my Answer of his Letter, <HI>page</HI> 3. to the tenth, which I thought
might give some satisfaction to all that which hath been spoke
to this thing, but have received no answer; It is said by one that
the determination mentioned by <HI>Cyprian,</HI> so farre as he can finde
by search, is the spring-head of infant-Baptisme, which upon
challenge made, he thus explaines. <HI>I did not deny that I found
infant-Baptism practised before, but that the determination of that
Councel was the spring-head that is the first determined rule or
Canon, by force of which, it hath since continued in a stream, and
this is true.</HI> It seemes the River had runne some hundreds of
years before the spring-head brake forth, but not in such a chan∣nel
as a determinate rule or Canon, when it is well known that
infant-Baptisme was not in that Councel of 66 Bishops at all agi∣tated,
much lesse determined; It was not put to the Question,
but taken for granted by all that were present. The dispute and
the determination was upon that which <HI>Fidus</HI> questioned, which
was the Baptisme of infants before eight dayes old, and not in∣fant-Baptisme;
how could he mean that it hath since continued
in a streame, by vertue of that determination or Canon, when he
very well knowes there was neither determination nor Canon
upon it, nor yet any need of it? They determined that which
in their meeting was put to the Vote, that an infant under
eight dayes might be baptized. So that this Quaere, as
all the rest, stands unsatisfied, and antiquity cleared for
infant-Baptisme.</P>
<P>It is yet farther said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infant Bap∣tism is not be∣stowed on un∣written tradi∣tion.</NOTE> that many learned men in former and lat∣ter
times, take infant-Baptisme onely for an unwritten traditi∣on;
giving us a list of Popish Writers that have spoke to this
purpose, <HI>a Cardinal in a Popish Councel,</HI> Bennus, Bellarmine <HI>and</HI>
Erasmus <HI>that had scarce stept over the threshold from them:</HI> To
which we answer, That it is no marvel, if these making it their
businesse to parallel unwritten Traditions with Scriptures, some
of them to preferre them before them, and knowing infant-Bap∣tisme
to be in honour in all Churches, do pin it upon unwritten
<PB N="419" REF="217"/>
Tradition, that so they may advance the honour of unwritten
Tradition with it, yet even these cite Scriptures for it, and so
marre their own market of Traditions, as those that procure them
are forced to acknowledge. When <HI>Bellarmine</HI> would argue the
Scriptures imperfection, and assert a necessity of unwritten Tra∣dition,
then he can affirme that infant-Baptisme, hath no other
foundation, but when he will defend infant-Baptisme against
those that matter not Tradition, he can finde Scripture for con∣firmation:
Foreseeing this Objection an Answer is brought out
of <HI>Bennus, That some things may be proved out of Scripture, when
the true sense of Scripture is evident; and infant-Baptisme is proved
from</HI> John 3. 5. <HI>but the sense whereby to prove it is manifest by tra∣dition,</HI>
Becan. Manual. <HI>lib. 1. cap. 2. sect.</HI> 24. It is very well
known that these Jesuites will say as much of any point of Faith,
and leave the whole meaning of all Scripture to rest on the Chur∣ches
interpretation, continued by tradition. As to the quotati∣on
of Protestant Authors, so many of them as have kept up the
honour of Scripture, and made no defection from that way, it
onely speakes their boldnesse to affirme that any of them ever
dishonoured infant-Baptisme in that way, as to settle it upon un∣written
tradition, or to fixe it on such a bottome. They very
well know, that, as they defend the Scriptures full perfection,
and make it their businesse to oppose all that would, have it ek't
out by any thing that is unwritten, so, they assert infant-Bap∣tisme
on Scripture-foundation. Can they think that they have
to deal with such weak adversaries, that whiles against their par∣ty
they contend with Scripture-Arguments, that infants ought
to be baptized, they will yield up the cause on the other hand to
Papists, and confesse the insufficiency of Scriptures. But the ho∣monymie
or various acception of the word Tradition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The various acception of the word Traditi∣on.</NOTE> may de∣ceive
the unwary Reader; Sometimes tradition is taken in the
proper sense, for that which is delivered, or handed over from
one to another, in this sense, every point of faith is a tradition,
and so is Baptism it self, as well as infant-Baptisme in which
sense <HI>Paul</HI> takes it, 2 <HI>Thes. 2. 15. Stand fast, and hold the tra∣ditions,
which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our E∣pistle.</HI>
Sometimes tradition is taken for that which is delivered
in word, without writing, as there is distinguished a tradition by
word, and a tradition by Epistle; what <HI>Paul</HI> taught in his Epistles
<PB N="420" REF="218"/>
is a tradition, and what <HI>Paul</HI> delivered by word of mouth is a
tradition, and both must be held. Here somewhat seemingly is
spoken for unwritten traditions by the Apostle. For solution of
which our Protestant Divines have taught us to<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Distinguen∣dum inter res∣quae traduntur in Ecclesia &amp; rationem earum tradendarum.</NOTE> <HI>distinguish be∣tween

Sermons are not written in Scriptures, as appears by his distin∣ction
before delivered, <HI>by word or Epistle,</HI> but the doctrine it self
that we deliver is contained there; <HI>Paul</HI> preached <HI>nothing but that
which</HI> Moses <HI>and the Prophets said should come,</HI> Acts 26. 22. yet
there were many words delivered by him, which <HI>Moses</HI> and the

there is par lex: Where there is like reason, there is like law. So

(it is said) <HI>sayes, The fourth kinde of Tradition is the continued pra∣ctice
of such things as are neither contained in the Scripture expresse∣ly,
nor the examples of such practice there delivered, though the
grounds, reasons, and causes of the necessity of such practice be there
contained, and the benefit or good that followeth it. Of this sort is
the Baptisme of infants, which is therefore named a tradition, be∣cause
it is not expressely delivered in Scripture that the A∣postles
did baptize infants, nor any expresse precept there found
that they should do so, yet is not this so received by bare and
naked tradition, but that we finde in Scripture to deliver un∣to
us the grounds of it.</HI> If they will subscribe to that part,
<HI>That the grounds, reasons, and causes of the necessity of in∣fant-Baptisme
are contained in Scriptures,</HI> then I will sub∣scribe
to the other, that those words, <HI>infants ought to be
baptized are not the Scripture.</HI> Then Doctor <HI>Prideaux</HI> is
brought in, who sayes, <HI>Paedobaptisme rests on no other di∣vine

Doctor <HI>Prideaux</HI> goes about to bring down infant-Baptism to
unwritten Tradition, or to bring up Episcopacy to divine
right according to Scripture. And out of these Premisses this
conclusion is inferred, <HI>that the Ancients and learned afore</HI> Zuin∣glius
<HI>did account infant-Baptisme to have been an unwritten traditi∣on,
having reason from Scripture not evident of it self, but to be re∣ceived
from the determination of the Church.</HI> Which for ought
that I can discerne is thus gathered, some Papists to set up
unwritten traditions have, in contradiction to themselves, faste∣ned
infant-Baptisme upon it, of which onely one lived before
<HI>Zuinglius.</HI> Some Protestant Writers, every one of them living
after <HI>Zuinglius</HI> speak not one word to the purpose: <HI>Ergo</HI> the
learned before <HI>Zuinglius</HI> did account infant-Baptisme to be an
unwritten tradition. Me thinks the Scripture-Arguments which

<HI>Aquinas 3. part. quaest. 68. art. 9. August. de Baptis. contra Donat.

<HEAD>CHAP. LVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The reality of connexion, between the Covenant and
initial seale, asserted.</HEAD>
<P>THe several minor propositions, in the syllogismes before laid
down, being proved at large, in the foregoing discourse. So
that nothing more needs to be added, yet if there be no necessa∣ry
connexion, between the covenant, and the seale, the major
propositions, will yet be called into question. Though it be
granted, that infants be Church-members, are in covenant,
have the promises, are Saints, are in the bosome of the Church by
birth-priviledge, are children of the Kingdome, &amp;c. Yet it
will be said (though most unreasonably) that they are not yet to be
baptized, I shall therefore 1. Bring Scripture proofes for the
real connexion between the covenant and the seale, clearing those
Scriptures from exceptions taken against them. 2. I shall make
it good with arguments or reasons. 3. I shall returne answer to
objections brought against that which is here asserted.</P>
<P><HI>That all in covenant, are to enjoy the initial seal of the cove∣nant,
let the words of God himself, in the institution of circum∣cision
be considered,</HI> Gen. 17. 7, 9, 10, 11, 14. I will establish
my covenant, between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their
generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and
to thy seed after thee. Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou,
and thy seed after thee, in their generations. This is my covenant
which ye shall keep, between me and you, and thy seed after thee, E∣very
man-child among you shall be circumcised, and ye shall circum∣cise
the flesh of your foreskinne, and it shall be a token of the covenant
betwixt me and you. And the uncircumcised man-child, whose flesh
of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his
people. <HI>Here we see 1. A covenant entered. 2. A seal appoin∣ted,
as the Apostle,</HI> Rom. 4. 11. <HI>calls it. 3. The necessary con∣nexion
between the seal and covenant declared. They are to be
circumcised, because they are in covenant, Having interest in the
covenant. They have together with it, interest in the initial
seal, against this is objected.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="423" REF="219"/>
First, <HI>All the force of this proof hangs on the particle [therefore,]</HI>
verse 9. <HI>and may be rendared; And thou, or, but thou, as well as,
thou therefore, and is by others rendered.</HI> Tu autem, <HI>and</HI> Tu ve∣ro,
<HI>which are neither of them illative termes.</HI> 1. We have no rea∣son
but that it may be an illative as well as a copulative, and be∣ing
an illative particle, he hath no exception against the strength
of it. 2. I deny, that all the force of the proof hangs on that
particle; look farther on into <HI>verse 10. This is my covenant, which
ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee; every man-childe
among you shall be circumcised,</HI> and take in with it <HI>Acts 7. 8.
And he gave him the covenant of circumcision; And so</HI> Abraham
<HI>begat</HI> Isaac, <HI>and circumcised him the eighth day, &amp;c.</HI> and let them
at more leisure finde an answer to this argument. That which
God himself calls by the name of a covenant, ought not to be
separated from it: But God calls circumcision by the name of a
covenant, <HI>Ergo</HI> they ought not to be separated. 2. Let them
consider the relation in which the Apostle puts this Sacrament
of circumcision to the covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. An instituted
appointed signe and seale, is not to be divided from that which
it signifies and seales, circumcision was an instituted appointed
signe and seale of the covenant; therefore it is not to be divided
from it.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is said, <HI>If it were granted, that [therefore] is the
best reading; yet that the inference,</HI> verse 9. <HI>should be made from the
Promise only,</HI> verse 7. <HI>I will be a God to thee and thy seed after thee,
and not as well, if not rather from the Promise,</HI> verse 8. <HI>of giving to
him and his seed the land of</HI> Canaan; <HI>I finde no sufficient reason
given.</HI> This reference engages the adversary, 1. In a contradiction
to himself, who sayes elsewhere, <HI>the promise of the Gospel was
confirmed to</HI> Abraham <HI>by the signe of circumcision.</HI> He also con∣tends
that it was a mixt covenant, made up of spiritual and tem∣poral
mercies, and then it must take in the spiritual as well as the
temporal Promise. All that know the nature of covenants, and
use of Seales, know that the Seale ratifies all that the covenant
containes: But the covenant (according to him) contained not
barely the promise of the land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> and therefore the re∣ference,
must carry it farther than the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> 2. It
engages him in a contradiction to the Apostle, who makes cir∣cumcision
a signe and seale, not alone of the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but <HI>of
the righteousnesse of faith.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="220"/>
Thirdly, It is said, <HI>But if it were yielded, that the inference were
made peculiarly from the Promise,</HI> verse 7. <HI>to be a God to</HI> Abraham
<HI>and his seed; it must be proved that every Believers Infant childe is</HI>
Abrahams <HI>seed, afore it be proved that the Promise belongs to them.</HI>
It must either be proved that they are <HI>Abrahams</HI> children▪ or have
the priviledge of the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> which from <HI>Genesis
9. 27. Rom.</HI> 11. 17. is sufficiently proved, especially being con∣firmed
by those Texts that carry the covenant in Gospel-times
to the issue. And for his exception that the <HI>covenant was not
made to every childe of</HI> Abraham, though it were true, yet it
would not serve his purpose, provided, that we in Gospel-times are
under the same covenant as was <HI>Isaac,</HI> to whom the promises were
made, If some of <HI>Abrahams</HI> children were left out, that concerns
not us, so that we are taken in; yet the instance is very weak to
prove it. <HI>As appeares</HI> (saith he) <HI>verse 19. concerning Ishmael,</HI>
and <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 9. that <HI>Ishmael</HI> was himself in covenant, though
not established in covenant, (as God there, and <HI>verse</HI> 21. pro∣mised
concerning <HI>Isaac</HI>) not his seed never received, appeares
not alone by the signe and seale which he received, <HI>verse</HI> 23.
which yet is sufficient (for God to seale to a blanke is very
strange; to signe a covenant to a man never in covenant) but
also from <HI>Gal. 4. 30. What saith the Scripture? Cast out the bond-woman
and her sonne, for the sonne of the bond-woman shall not be heir
with the sonne of the free-woman.</HI> A man cast out of covenant,
was before casting out, in covenant; Ejection supposes admission,
unlesse we will give way to our Authors dreame of Ejection by
non-admission. He was cast out after the time of the solemnity
of his admission by circumcision, as may be seen, <HI>Gen,</HI> 22. For
that of <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 9. it is a mystery what he will make of it, un∣lesse
he will conclude, that because <HI>Abraham</HI> sojourned in the
land of Promise, that therefore none were in covenant that were
not taken into that land; so <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> will be found out
of covenant.</P>
<P>It is further said, <HI>As for a visible Church-seed of</HI> Abraham, <HI>that
is neither his seed by nature, nor by saving faith, nor by excellency,
in whom the Nations of the Earth should be blessed, to wit, Christ;
I know none such in Scripture, therefore some men have fancied such
a kind of Church-seed, as it is called.</HI> I know not how saving faith
comes in, when a faith of profession will serve the turne; The
<PB N="425" REF="220"/>
whole of <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed had circumcision as a seale of the righ∣teousnesse
of faith, when many of their Parents had no more than
a faith of profession.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Were all these things yielded, yet the Proposition</HI> (as
is said) <HI>would not be made good from hence.</HI> All these we see are
made good against his exceptions. Let us now see the strength
which is reserved for the last push, for overthrow of this Propo∣sition.
<HI>The inference is not concerning title or right of infants to the
initial seale, as if the covenant or promise of it self did give that;
but the inference is concerning</HI> Abrahams <HI>duty, that therefore he
should be the more engaged to circumcise his posterity.</HI> This should
rather have been left to us for the strengthening of our proposi∣tion,
than have made use of it himself for refutation of it. It
was <HI>Abrahams</HI> duty to give them according to Gods command
the initial Seale: in this we are agreed: whether it will thence
follow that they had right and title to it, or were without right,
let the Reader determine.</P>
<P>It is further said, <HI>He was engaged to circumcise onely those that
are males, and not afore eight dayes, and not onely those that were
from himself, but also, all in his house whose children soever they
were, which apparently shewes that the giving Circumcision was not
commensurate to the persons interest in the Covenant, but was to be
given to persons as well out of the Covenant as in; If of Abrahams
house, and not to all that were in the Covenant; to wit Females, which
doth clearly prove that right to the initiall Seale, as it is called, of
circumcision, did not belong to persons by vertue of the covenant, but
by force of the command.</HI> If it could be proved that <HI>Abraham</HI> kept
Idolaters in his house, professedly worshipping a false god, and
gave circumcision to them in that faith and way of false worship;
it would prove that a man might have the seale, and not be in
covenant; but it would not prove that he might be in covenant,
and be denied the Seale, and then infant-Baptisme might be of
easier proof. Though they were not in covenant, though they
were not holy, yet they might be baptized. But I will not yield
so much; I do not believe that <HI>Abraham</HI> carried circumcision be∣yond
the line of the covenant, and that he had those in his house
which were aliens from God; seeing I finde that Testimony of
the Lord concerning him, <HI>Gen. 18. 19. For I know him, that he
will command his children, and his houshold after him, and they shall
<PB N="426" REF="221"/>
keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgement; that the Lord
may bring upon</HI> Abraham <HI>that which he hath spoken of him.</HI> And
that resolution of <HI>Joshua, That if others would serve the gods that
their fathers served that were on the other side the floud, or the gods
of the</HI> Amorites <HI>in whose land they dwell; yet he and his house would
serve the Lord,</HI> Josh. 24. 14, 15. As it is a private mans duty to
serve the Lord, and not Idols, so it is the Master of the Fami∣lies
duty to see that the Lord and not Idols be worshipped in his
house. As I do beleeve that if any of our adversaries had a pro∣fest
Heathen in his Family, he would not keep him there, and
not chatechize him, and that he would not during his profession
of Heathenisme baptize him: So, I beleeve concerning <HI>Abraham,</HI>
He catechized all that he took in as Heathens, and did not cir∣cumcise
them in their Heathenisme. <HI>This some Paedobaptists</HI> (as
is said) <HI>are forced to confesse, when they grant the formal reason
of the Jewes being circumcised, was the command, and the covenant
he makes only a motive.</HI> I wonder what need there is of an Argu∣ment
to force such a confession. The reason I say, why Jewes
were circumcised, and Christians baptized, is the command;
were there a thousand covenants, and no institution of a signe,
or seale, such a signe or seale, there could have been no circumci∣sion,
nor no Baptisme. The command is the ground, and the
covenant is the directory to whom application si to be made. We
say, all in covenant are entituled to the Seale for admission; but
we pre-suppose an institution. They will have all Beleevers, and all
Disciples baptized, which they cannot conclude upon their faith
and knowledge barely, but upon the command to baptize Be∣leevers
and Disciples; So that the command is with reference to
the covenant, with reference to interest in the covenant. From
these foregoing exceptions a conclusion is drawne, that <HI>all this
doth fully shew, that the proof of the connexion between, and the i∣nitial
Seale without a particular command for it, is without any
weight in it.</HI> And I conclude, that it fully shewes that the proof
of the connexion between the covenant and the initial Seale,
(pre-supposing the institution of such a Seale, and a general com∣mand)
is of that weight that all are meere frivolous trifles that are
brought for exceptions against it.</P>
<P>Another Scripture holding out the connexion between the
covenant and initial seale is, <HI>Acts 2. 38, 39. Repent and be bap∣tized
<PB N="427" REF="221"/>
every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
remission of sinnes, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost, for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to
all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</HI>
Here I must mind the Reader of that which I have already
spoken on this text, concerning this text, Chap. On which
words after a brief <HI>Analasis</HI> (which there may be seen) I have
grounded this argument, They to whom the covenant of
promise appertains, have right to Baptisme. But the cove∣nant
of promise, belongs to men in a Church-state, and
condition; together with their children, therefore, those
that are in a Church-state, and condition, have right to Bap∣tisme
together with their children. My businesse being then,
to assert the just latitude of the covenant; without respect
to Baptisme or any other seale, I spoke only to the minor
proposition, that the covenant extends it selfe not alone,
to men professedly in a Church-state, but also to their chil∣dren
with them, and to that I think I have there spoke suf∣ficient.
Now I am put upon the proof of the major. That
they, to whom the covenant of the promise appertaines,
have right to baptisme. If this faile, it must be confest, that
the ground of infant-Baptisme, as to this Text, falls with it,
seeing their right is not asserted, <HI>quâ</HI> infants, no more
than the right of men of growth or men of yeares, <HI>quâ</HI> of
growth, or in yeares, but as they stand in reference to God
in coventnt, and this is clear in the Text. <HI>Be baptized, for the
promise is to you, and to your children.</HI> Because they are vest∣ed
in the promise, they have their right and interest in the
seale. If this do not hold, the Apostles argument falls to
evade this full and cleare argument, one is bold to say,
that in the expounding of these words there are almost as
many mistakes as words, when words are only brought to
convince us, of so many mistakes, though in a multiplica∣tion
of exceptions.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="222"/>
First, <HI>The Exposition is commonly carried as if the promise
there meant, were the promise,</HI> Gen. 17. 7. <HI>To</HI> Abraham
<HI>and his seed, and this expounded as if it were meant that God
would be a God to every Believer, and to his seed, in respect at
least of visible Church-Membership.</HI> When a promise is men∣tioned,
and a seale, any man but he will presently under∣stand
that promise, which is ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ified by such a seale. For
discovery of their mistake that make any other reference of
it, I shall referre the Reader to what I have said on these
words. <HI>Chap</HI> 48. and to Master <HI>Cobbets Vindication, Part. 1.
Chap. 2. Sect.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, it is said,</HI> They expound [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 39.]
as if it were a promise of a thing to come some outward priviledg
to be conferred on them and their children, whereas the chief
thing meant in the speech i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that as is expressly said by <HI>Paul,</HI>
Acts 13. 32, 33. <HI>Yet no man is quoted for this Expositi∣on
of a thing to come, but on the contrary quotes Master</HI>
Cobbet <HI>against it. It is meant of a present right for as yet
they were not broken off from the Olive, not Gentiles g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣fed
in, in the instead.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, It is said, <HI>It is taken as if [to you] were meant of
those persons to whom he spake, as then Believers, and under that
formal consideration, and then reasons are brought against it.</HI> I
do not interpret it of any present explicite Faith in Christ
as the Messiah; though now this conviction, that so evidently
appeared, did evidence them to be in an hopeful way, and
with that Scribe not to be far from the Kingdome of God,
and therefore he takes his opportunity, and presseth it on to
come into the way of Believers in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly It is said,</HI> [your children] is expounded of their
Infant-children, yea, it is carried as if of them only <HI>To thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is
sufficient spoken,</HI> Chap, 48.</P>
<P><HI>As for that which follows;</HI> They would have the promise to be
<PB N="429" REF="222"/>
to their children as theirs, whether they be called or no; which can
be verified only in their sense of their infants, sith they maintain that
even the children of Beleevers are not in covenant; the promise is
not to them, they are not visible Church-members when they
come to years of discretion, except they be called in their own
persons, and accept the call. <HI>Children as theirs, whether
they be called or no, is a contradiction; Children are called
in their Parents call, and we say, they are in covenant, the
Promise is made to them; they are visible Church-members till
they reject the covenant, and deny their Membership, this is a
calumny.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly, He sayes,</HI> Whereas it is urged, that when it is said
the promise is to all that are afarre off, even as many as the Lord our
God shall call, which is expounded of the Gentiles, it is not added to
their children: <HI>To this in the same chapter sufficient is spoken.</HI></P>
<P>A sixth, is the same with the tenth, and thither I shall refer the
Reader.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly, It is said,</HI> And in like manner we hold the command,
[Be babtized every one of you] in a covenant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sense (that is, a new
devised non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sense, such as we have no Dictionary yet to interpret words
by) be baptized you and your children. <HI>I am sure here is a non-sense
devise to talk of Dictionaries, does</HI> Calepin <HI>or</HI> Scapula, Rider <HI>or</HI>
Thomasius <HI>help us to compare covenant and seale, promises and
Sacraments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eighthly, It is said,</HI> Some would possesse people with this conceit as
if <HI>Peters</HI> scope were to take away by <HI>ver.</HI> 39. an objection or scruple
they would make. If we be baptized our selves, our children shall be in
worse case, in respect of the priviledge our children had in the former
dispensation of the covenant, when they had the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al of the covenant,
if they be not to be baptized also; and that he answers them by assuring
them that in this dispensation also their children were in covenant,
and were to have the seale of the covenant. <HI>And then addes,</HI> There
is not a word of any such scruple in the Text; nor i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> likely that they
were sollicitous about such an imaginary poor priviledge of their chil∣dren.
<HI>I am of the same mind that there was no such scruple in their
heads. This unhappy conceit of casting the seed out of covenant
was not then in being, though I think the reason given is little to
purpose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ninthly, He sayes,</HI> They all do most grossely abuse the meaning of
<PB N="430" REF="223"/>
the Apostle, in interpreting the inference of the Apostle, signified by
the particle [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for, <HI>vers.</HI> 39.] which they would have to be this,
you have right and war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant to be baptized; For the promise is to
you and your children, as if the illative particle did inferre a warrant,
or right for them and theirs to be baptized; whereas the thing inferred
is not any right, which in a legal way they might claime; but is a
plaine motive in a moral way urged to perswade them to be baptized.
<HI>They do grossely abuse their own judgement in this way of
refutation, as though the right in which they stood, could be no
Topick, from which in a moral way the Apostle might perswade
them to Baptisme. When</HI> Shechaniah <HI>perswaded</HI> Ezra <HI>to the re∣formation
of the marriage of strange wives in these words,</HI> Arise
for the matter belongeth unto thee, <HI>Ezra 10. 4. Here was a motive
in a moral way to call upon him to do it, and an Argument in∣ferred,
that it lay upon</HI> Ezra <HI>as a duty by command from God to
set upon it. The reason added is worthy of observation:</HI> This is ma∣nifest
from the form of words, <HI>ver.</HI> 38. which if they had exprest a right
to Baptisme by vertue of the promise, should have been in the indica∣tive
mood in such a forme as this; you are to be baptized, you may be
baptized, you have right to it, the Minister ought to do it; but the
words are in the imparative mood, exhorting them and perswading
them to it, <HI>They have quite forgotten, that the words holding out
their right, are in the</HI> indicative mood, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
For the promise is to you and your children. <HI>And
here is a notable correction of the Apostle, he should have said,
if this had been his meaning, you must be baptized; and he sayes,</HI>
Arise, and be baptized.</P>
<P>Lastly, It is said, <HI>In the paraphrases, which usually in their dis∣putes,</HI>
Paedobaptists <HI>make of</HI> Acts 2. 38, 39. <HI>they put not any thing
to answere the terme [repent] as if it stood for a cipher, but para∣phrase
it thus, Ye may be baptized, you and your children; for the
Promise is to you, and your children.</HI> The sixth exception was against
our interpretation of the word <HI>repent, ver.</HI> 38. as if it were as
much as to say, <HI>Covenant for your selves and your children;</HI> and
here it is complained that it is left for a cipher. And the Author
thinks he hath discovered the reason of this Omission. <HI>The put∣ting
the word repent first, and be baptized after, doth manifest∣ly
overthrow their paraphrase of a right to Baptisme from the word of
promise, and shew that the particle, [For] doth not prove a right
<PB N="431" REF="223"/>
to Baptisme, but presse to a duty; and such a duty as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have repent∣ance
precedent, and that in every person that is to be baptized.</HI> I con∣fesse
it presseth to a duty, and such a duty as is to have repentance
precedent in them that at that time were his hearers, to interest
themselves, and with themselves their children in this priviledge;
But right and duty do not shoulder out one the other, but very
well stand together; encouraging to a duty which is a priviledge
as well as a duty, he fitly makes use of their interest as a motive.
And they might see that the Apostle puts the promise in a greater
latitude than he urgeth repentance; He speakes to his hearers,
when he sayes <HI>repent;</HI> and he tells them, <HI>that the promise is to
them and to their children with them:</HI> Whereas our Author pres∣seth
the precedency of the word, <HI>repent,</HI> to the command of be∣ing
baptized, and elsewhere saith, <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er doth exhort to Repentance
and Baptisme together, and in the first place perswades to Repentance,
then to Baptisme, which shewes Repentance to be in order before Bap∣tisme;</HI>
I answer, as I did before <HI>Chap.</HI> 48. that these who had
crucified Christ as a blasphemer, as a seditious person; an im∣postor,
must needs repent before they would accept Baptisme in
his name, or hope for remission of sinne by him. It had been lost
labour for the Apostle to have pressed those that had crucified
Christ, and retained their former opinion of him, to become
Disciples to him, and to look to be saved by him; to perswade
them to look for remission of sinnes in his blood, who took them∣selves
to be without sinne in shedding of it, and yet notwithstan∣ding
this guilt (of which the Apostle would have them to re∣pent)
he shewes that they and their seed are under the promise
of God, and puts them into a way in acceptation of Christ in the
Gospel-tender, in his present way of administration to be con∣tinued
his people still in covenant, and that (as is plainly enough
signified) that they might enjoy it in their former latitude, <HI>to
them and to their children.</HI> So that Master <HI>Stephens</HI> his Interpre∣tation
so much sleighted by an adversary, and repeated
not in his words, but in his own paraphrase upon them,
is indeed the Apostles meaning. <HI>The Apostle</HI> (saith he. <HI>pag. 14.)
doth speak to these Jewes who had crucified Christ; that if they would
receive him as the particular</HI> Messiah, <HI>the same promise should still
continue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to them and their children in the new dispensation: And on
this doth he build the word of command, to baptize father and childe;</HI>
<PB N="432" REF="224"/>
To this the word <HI>repent</HI> here referres as may be made
plaine.</P>
<P>First, By taking into consideration the present state of this
people, and that in several particulars.</P>
<P>1. As yet they had the promises with them, and were children
of the covenant, <HI>Acts</HI> 3. 25. Though the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4.
do distinguish between the covenants and the promises; yet to
have the promises here, and to be children of the covenant, there
seemes to be one. If any can distinguish them, this people, had
the honour of both of them; God had not yet cast them out of
a Church-state and covenant-relation.</P>
<P>2. They were in present danger to be cast off according to
what Christ had foretold, <HI>Mat. 8. 12. Mat.</HI> 21. 43. Being
so fast riveted to the ceremonial Law which now was dead,
and presently grew deadly: God denying any presence (as
hath been said) with them, now the substanee was
come.</P>
<P>3. These particular persons with whom <HI>Peter</HI> had to deale,
were now well prepared for a free acceptation of a Gospel-way,
under this administration, which Jesus Christ (having pulled
down the Law of Ordinances) was to set up: Being amazed
with the glory of the mircale which was wrought before their
eyes, and convinced with the powerful application of the Pro∣phets
by <HI>Peter</HI> in that elegant Sermon, they fell upon enquiry
what they should do.</P>
<P>Secondly, By comparing other Texts of Scripture, which may
serve as a Comment to the clearing of this; especially two Texts
of two Evangelists, recording the words of Christ, and holding
out the impenitent obstinacy of the Jewes, standing out against
every call to repentance, respective to their rigid pertinacious ad∣hering
to former dispensations, and opposition of that now ten∣dered
and offered to them. 1. That of our Saviour Christ,
<HI>Mat.</HI> 21. 31, 32. Christ having held before them, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. 29,
30. the parable of a <HI>certain man, that had two sonnes, and came
to the first, and said, sonne, go work to day in my Vine-yard; He
answered and said, I will not; but afterward he repented, and went;
And he came to the second, and said likewise; and he answered and
said, I go Sir, and went not,</HI> and made appeale to them, <HI>ver. 31.
Whether of them twaine did the will of his father?</HI> and they answer∣ing,
<PB N="433" REF="224"/>
<HI>the first: Jesus saith unto them,</HI> (as it followes in that and
the next verse) <HI>Verily I say unto you, that the Publicans and Har∣lots
go into the Kingdome of God before you; For</HI> John <HI>came unto
you in the way of righteousnesse, and ye beleeved him not; but the
Publicans and the Harlots believed him. And ye, when ye had seen
it, repented not afterward, that ye might beleeve in him.</HI> The
Publicans and Harlots answer to the first brother, who from a pro∣fessed
rebellion against the command of God, by <HI>Johns</HI> preaching,
were brought to repent, and accept of a Gospel-covenant, and
enter into it by Baptisme. The chief Priests and Elders of the
people (that here opposed Christ preaching the Gospel of the
Kingdome) answer to the second brother that said, he would
go into the Vine-yard, and went not; These repent not, but hold
fast, and pertinaciously adhere to the way of old received, when
the Publicans accept and imbrace the spiritual state of the
Church by Christ set up. From this impenitence of these chiefe
Priests and Elders with whom these joyned in crucifying Christ;
<HI>Peter</HI> disswades, and exhorts to the repentance of the Publicanes
and Harlots. The second Scripture which may give light to this
text, is much parallel to this, <HI>Luke</HI> 7. 29, 30. Christ having given
a large testimony to <HI>John</HI> and his Ministry; holds out the diffe∣rent
effect that it took: First, in the people and the Publicanes,
<HI>ver. 29. And all the people that heard him, and the Publicanes
justified God, being baptized with the Baptisme of John.</HI>
Secondly, in the Pharisees and Lawyers, <HI>ver. 30. But the pharisees
and Lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, be∣ing
not baptized.</HI> They persisted in their old way, in oppositi∣on
to that way held forth by <HI>John,</HI> approved by Christ, and re∣fused
baptisme, These with whom <HI>Peter</HI> had to deale, had gone
with the Priests and Pharisees, kept full pace with them even to
the guilt of the death of Christ, they were now in a good way to
follow the steps of the Publicanes and People, to embrace the
counsel of God, and accept baptisme, their impenitence had
held them from entrance into a new covenant-way by baptisme,
<HI>Peter</HI> therefore exhorts to repent and be baptized.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This appeares by the Text it selfe, whereas they
will have the illative particle <HI>For,</HI> to inferre no warrant or
right in them to be baptized, but onely a motive in a moral way
urged, as we have heard in the last exception. It is worth our enqui∣ry
<PB N="435" REF="225"/>
to learne what good interpretation suitable to <HI>Peters</HI> exhor∣tation,
they put here on those words, <HI>To you is the promise made,
and to your children,</HI> excluding all consideration of right, in them
and their children, <HI>Because Christ was promised to them and their
children, therefore they must repent and be baptized.</HI> Not to in∣sist
upon that just exception of Master <HI>Gobbet,</HI> page 23. <HI>That
the Apostle doth not say, the promise was to you as in reference to the
time of making it to the fathers, with respect unto them, or in refe∣rence
to Christ, who was not now to come, but already come, as the
Apostle proveth from</HI> ver. 3. <HI>to 37. Nor is it the use of the Scri∣pture
when mentioning promises as fulfilled, to expresse it thus in the
present tense, the promise is to you, or to such and such, but rather
to annex some expression that way which evinceth the same,</HI> giving
instance almost in twenty several texts, which utterly overthrows
his exposition. Let them tell us why in this moral perswasive
holding out a bare motive to perswade the parent onely, the
children (not concerned in the thing and in an utter incapacity)
should be mentioned. And why the words should be carried in
that way that interest in covenant and covenant-seales formerly
ran, and no right at all to covenant or covenant-seales intended?
This glosse puts too much violence upon the words. But carry∣ing
it on as a disswasive from persistance in their former way of
old covenant legal rites, and perswading to embrace the way ap∣pointed
by him, whom God had made both Lord and Christ, it
singularly answers, as, to their present condition, yet in cove∣nant,
though in eminent danger to be cast out of covenant, so, also
to the words of the text, holding out a covenant-right in Scripture
language according to the grand Charter of heaven. <HI>I will be
thy God, and the God of thy seed;</HI> so that I hope by this time, the
intelligent Reader will easily perceive the frivolous shifts instead
of a ful refutation that's here brought to avoid <HI>Paedobaptists</HI> proofs
of a word of command to Baptize infants from this Scripture.</P>
<P>As these Scriptures plainly hold out the necessary connexion
of the covenant and initial seale, so, the evidence of reason is
cleare for it. No man that stands enrighted or legally interested,
in any priviledge, or possession, may be denied that ceremony
or seal which is appointed for confirmation. A copy-hold being
found the next immediate tenant, of a copy-hold-right must not
be denied, but received according to the ceremony, or solemni∣ty
<PB N="436" REF="225"/>
of the place, whensoever the King did grant, out letters-pat∣tents,
the Lord Keeper might not deny the seale, the Lords Com∣missioners,
may not now deny it to any, that by a just grant
have interest. This were to keep a childe out of his fathers
house, a servant from his place of abode and residence; when
Christ was so much displeased with his Disciples on like occasion,
these may well expect to be under as high displeasure. Having
thus made good the point, it remaines that I take off some ob∣jections,
and meet with some quarrels that are raised against
it.</P>
<P><HI>If there be any necessary connexion between the covenant and the
seale, it must be</HI> (saith one) <HI>either, by reason of some necessary
connexion between the termes which is none, for it is but a common
accident to a man that hath a promise or a covenant made to him, that
he should have a special signe, it may adesse vel abesse à subjecto, it
may be present or absent from the subject.</HI> Giving some instances
of covenants without seales. <HI>Answ.</HI> 1. By way of concussion
it will be easily granted, that a covenant may stand alone with∣out
a seale annexed? but where a seale is appointed for confirma∣tion,
(as there hath been in the Church ever since God took a
people to himself out of <HI>Abrahams</HI> loines) there is a necessary
connexion. This answer he foresees, and sayes: <HI>But you will
say, All that are</HI> foederati <HI>should be</HI> signati, <HI>since the solemne cove∣nant
with</HI> Abraham; <HI>But neither is this certaine, sith we finde no
such thing concerning</HI> Melchizedek <HI>and</HI> Lot, <HI>that lived in</HI> Abrahams
<HI>time, nor concerning</HI> Job <HI>that it's conceived lived after his time.</HI>
If we read nothing to confirme it, the Reader sees nothing to
contradict it; There is added, <HI>But you will say, it is true of all
the</HI> foederati <HI>in</HI> Abrahams <HI>family. But neither is that true, for male-children
before the eighth day, and women though</HI> foederatae, <HI>yet were
not to be signed.</HI> Is there no connexion between them, because he
that receives into covenant and appoints the seale, hath prescribed
a time when it shall be applied? A man that hath a grant from
King or State, hath <HI>ipso facto</HI> right to the seale, and the right ne∣cessarily
followes upon the grant, though he must stay till a seal∣ing
day before he possesse it.</P>
<P>For the exception of women, though <HI>foederatae,</HI> yet were not
to be circumcised; I say, 1. Master <HI>Marshal</HI> hath sufficiently an∣swered,
that they were of the circumcision, and it was an excep∣tion
<PB N="436" REF="226"/>
against <HI>Sampson</HI> by his parents that he would go to take a
wife of the uncircumcised Philistines, <HI>Judg.</HI> 14. 3. Had he
married in <HI>Israel,</HI> as he ought in obedience to God and his pa∣rents,
he had married a wife of the circumcised, though that sex
by nature is in an incapacity of that signe or seale. In diverse
places of <HI>England,</HI> the husband being admitted by verdict of a
Jury into an estate, the wife is virtually admitted; his admission
is her admission, so it was in circumcision. 2. They had doubt∣lesse
actually received that signe of circumcision as in New Testa∣ment
times they do Baptisme, <HI>Acts 8. 12. Acts</HI> 16. 15. but
that it was a signe whereof they were in an incapacity. It is far∣ther
added, <HI>If then I should farther grant the conclusion, That in∣fants
of beleevers were to be</HI> signati, <HI>yet you would not say they are
to be partakers of the Lords Supper, because it is not appointed for
them; So in like manner if it were granted you that infants of belee∣vers
were to be signed, yet it followes not that they are to be baptized,
unlesse you can prove that it is appointed to them; and the truth is,
if it were granted that children were</HI> foederati, <HI>yet it were a high
presumption in us to say therefore they must be</HI> signati, <HI>without Gods
declaration of his minde; and if it were granted they must be</HI> signati,
<HI>it were in like manner a high presumption in us to say, therefore they
must be baptized, without Gods declaration of his minde concerning
that Ordinance.</HI> To this a reply is made by another hand, that
there is difference between a seale for initiation, and a
seale for confirmation; a seale, wherein no more is of necessity,
than to be passive; and that wherein we are to be active; yet to
come more near to them, I am content to yield the conclusion,
supposing that his argument is of force, Every Church-member
hath true title to all Church-priviledges; But infants are Church-members,
the Lords Supper is a Church-priviledge; and there∣fore
infants have true title to it. But then I must distinguish <HI>jus ad
rem,</HI> and <HI>jus in re,</HI> every infant hath right to it, yet by reason of in∣fancy
hath his actual interest suspended; <HI>Paul</HI> by birth had right to
all the priviledg of the Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> being born free, <HI>Acts</HI> 22. 28.
yet it does not follow that he was to give his vote, or appear in
Assemblies as a free Citizen in the time of his minority; <HI>James</HI>
the sixth was crowned in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
in the time of their minority, so that they were reckoned
among the Kings of Nations; yet neither of them did in their
<PB N="437" REF="226"/>
own persons exercise <HI>regalia</HI> till yeares of discretion. As these
infants of title were crowned, so infants that are Church-mem∣bers
are to be baptized, when yet an infant can no more partake,
as a Christian ought, of the Lords Supper, than an infant King
can wield the great things of his Kingdome. An infant-heir from
the first instant of his fathers death, and a posthumous childe
from the time of his birth, stands seized of his fathers inheri∣tance;
The whole title is vested in him, how ample soever, and
in no other, and he is received into it, and lives upon it, yet he
is held from the managing of it till he can improve for his own
and the publike benefit; So that the taking into covenant is a
sufficient declaration of Gods minde, that the signes and seals in
an orderly way should be granted to them, and all these appeare
to be cavils, and not answers.</P>
<P>As, these exceptions are causlesly taken against the connexion
between the covenant and eale; so, quarrels are raised, against
some phrases in common use among Divines relating to this thing,
as making the metaphor of a seale the <HI>Genus</HI> of a Sacrament,
which (if an errour) was the Apostles errour, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11. and ma∣ny
such like, with which it is needlesse to trouble the Reader.</P>

<P>HEnce farther followes, that the Prohibition of infant-Bap∣tisme

unto God the things that are Gods,</HI> Matth. 22. 21. Adversaries
fasten the brand of will-worship on the practice of it; But if
<PB N="439" REF="227"/>
Baptisme be any worship according to the minde of Christ, then
infant-Baptisme is out of all danger or possibility of will-wor∣ship.
In case infants were not within he verge, yet their Bap∣tisme
could be no will worship; we set not up of our selves the
Ordinance that we apply to them, but make application of the
Ordinance that Christ hath instituted; In case they have no title,
there is onely a misapplication of worship instituted, and no de∣vise
of worship. To this is replied, and demand made <HI>whether
infant-communion were not will-worship? whether baptizing of
Bells were not will-worship? yet these are but misapplications of an
instituted ordinance to a wrong subject.</HI> I answer, none of these
were will-worship, nor yet the Baptisme of the Horse in <HI>Hun∣tingdon</HI>-shire,
but the horrid prophanation of an instituted wor∣ship;
Baptisme is still Gods, but the application mans, and here
the will is not carried to a devise of an ordinance, but alone to
the application of it. Our adversaries making it a corruption of
the Ordinance of Baptisme, acquit it from will-worship: But in
infant-Baptisme we neither devise an Ordinance, nor of our own
heads make application of it: we know they belong to the fami∣ly
of Jesus Christ, we know Christs order to admit them to the
priviledge that was proper to those of his family, and as faithful
stewards we follow the will of our Master, not our own will,
but the will of Christ Jesus. Could they wash their hands of
Sacriledge, as we are able to clear our wills and wits from devise
of a worship, it were better with them; The times were, when
men looked upon things consecrate (as holy to the Lord) in a
multiplying glasse; we had holy places, holy Altars, in which
some of our present opponents went too farre to the grief of the
godly, and farther than the times with their streames needed to
have borne them, had he been meerely prest, and no voluntier
in it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extremes are dangerous.</NOTE> I wish they would seriously consider, how ordinary it is
with men to carry on their wayes in extreames, and out of su∣perstition
to runne upon Sacriledge. It is well known how apt
the people of <HI>Israel</HI> were for idolatrous wayes, and ready to em∣brace
every superstition after the way of the Heathen, and in
conformity to them; yet after the Babylonish captivity, they
were quite taken off that course; What wickednesse soever they
were otherwise guilty of, yet it is observed that they kept them∣selves
from Idols; That sinne had so consumed them, that at last
<PB N="440" REF="227"/>
it had even wearied them: And then (as it appeares from the
Apostle) they runne upon this extreame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jewes lea∣ving idolatry, run upon Sa∣criledge.</NOTE> to which we are here
speaking; Therefore when in other things they are charged with
the same sinne that (as men of knowledge) they condemned in
others, <HI>Thou that preachest that another should not steale, doest thou
steale? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, doest thou
commit adultery?</HI> And the <HI>Series</HI> of the words leading to a charge
of Idolatry, the Apostle changes the phrase, and saith, <HI>Thou
that abhorrest Idols, doest thou commit Sacriledge?</HI> Rom. 2. 22.
This was now their sinne in the other extreame, not on their
own heads to put a supposition of holinesse to the Lord on any
thing for worship, but to convert to other uses that which was
sanctified as holy. I know some understand these words in a
Metaphor, that by Sacriledge is meant the robbing of God of his
honour by sinne against him; but that interpretation the next
words contradict, in distinct words forbidding that Sacriledge,
if they will so call it. <HI>Origen</HI> will turne it into an Allegory, and
understand the spoyling of the sense of Scriptures, and stealing
Christ out of the Scriptures; But the text is plaine, that it is a re∣proof
applied to their capacities, and in the letter convincing, as
well as the former of stealing, and adultery, <HI>The plaine sense,</HI>
(saith <HI>Peter Martyr) is the meaning.</HI> May not I now say that
these things are out examples, to the intent that we should not
runne with them in these extreames from an abhorrency of the
one to the other, from an abhorrency of Idols to the guilt of Sa∣criledge,
which according to the Schoolmen is <HI>rei sacrae viola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io,</HI>
or <HI>rerum sacrarum furtum, a deteigning from God that which for
an holy use is separate for him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Separation for God of persons or of inanimate or unreasona∣ble creatures. Whether Sa∣criledge be any New Testa∣ment sin.</NOTE> which separation is either of per∣sons,
or of inanimate, or irrational creatures. I know there are
those that affirme that there is no such separation for God in Gos∣pel
times, and consequently there can be no such thing as this sin
of Sacriledge in our times, for what is not, cannot be thus vio∣lated
or detained. As to the separation of inanimate or unrea∣sonable
creatures it cannot be fully denied, nor yet must it fully be
yielded, that no such things are now to be accounted as separate
to the Lord, we must therefore distinguish. These may be said to
be separate for God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Separation for God either by institution or approbation.</NOTE> and consequently holy, two wayes. 1. By
divine institution and appointment, So the Temple and Utensils
of the Temple were holy. 2. By divine approbation, when men
<PB N="440" REF="228"/>
let them apart for advancement of such an holy use as God ap∣proves.
The former we confesse was proper to the times of the
Law, but the latter yet remaines in Gospel-times, and upon this
account <HI>Ravanellus</HI> justly makes the sinne of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sap∣phira,</HI>
(in keeping back part of the price of their land that was
set apart by them for the service of the Church) to be the sinne
of Sacriledge. The land before sale was his own, and the price
after sale was his own, but now it was to serve (by their vo∣luntary
act) onely to a purpose that was holy; The detaining of
it is the violation of that which is holy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Places for wor∣ship and main¦tenance of those that attend up∣on worship se∣parate by di∣vine approba∣tion.</NOTE> And in this way, both
the places of publick worship, and the revenues for maintenance
of those that attend upon this worship, are separate for God:
It will be thought somewhat out of my way to speak to these
things, yet having so fair an occasion, I shall take the liberty of
a few words, concerning the places of worship, shall speak some∣what
in the [negative,] and by way of concession; There is
not any such holinesse in them, as in the Tabernacle and Temple,
This is disavowed by Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Positious con∣cerning places.</NOTE> <HI>John</HI> 4. 23. These had the
preheminence above our places of meeting in foure several
particulars.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negative.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. <HI>They had their institution, and immediate injunction from
God,</HI> Exod. 35. 10, 11. 1 Kings 5. 5. 1 Chron. 22. 9, 10.</P>
<P>2. Their direction and prescription, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 5.</P>
<P>3. Their promise, not alone respective to the worship, but the
place, <HI>Exod.</HI> 29. 42, 43.</P>
<P>4. Their sanction or penalty in regard of typical prophanati∣on,
<HI>Num.</HI> 19. 20. In all of these particulars we must give the
Temple and Tabernacle the preeminence, besides that the Tem∣ple
and Tabernacle were but one for all <HI>Israel,</HI> we have many. In
the affirmative I shall lay down several positions.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Positive.</NOTE> there is equal warrant and reason for the building of our
places of meeting, for the worship of God, as there was for the
Synagogues of the Jewes; Though we put no such holinesse on
these places to parallel them with the Temple, yet they have e∣qual
warrant, and are to have equal respect with the Synagogues
which the Jewes had in every City, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 21. Not only in
<HI>Judea,</HI> but where they were dispersed, <HI>Acts</HI> 13. 14, 15. There
is no word in all the Scripture for the erecting of these Syna∣gogues,
no mention made of them but once, where a sad com∣plaint
<PB N="441" REF="228"/>
is made of the burning of them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 74. 8. But the peo∣ple
of God being by Gods command to be instructed in the Law,
they built them places for conveniency of meeting, and in such
places they met, The Law was there preacht, Christ and his A∣postles
did preach there, our places of meeting then stand in
equal honour with these Synagogues: Those that can
say any thing for these Synagogues, which we can∣not
say for our publick places of meeting, let them produce
it.</P>
<P>2. There is as much reason and equal warrant to call our pla∣ces
of meeting by the usual common Name of Churches, as to call
theirs by the common name of Synagogues; Nothing can be said
to condemne the use of the word Church for our place of meeting,
but the like may be said to condemne, the use of the word Sy∣nagogue
for their place of meeting. The Scriptures therefore cal∣ling
theirs Synagogues, <HI>Luke 7. 5. Acts</HI> 18. 7. we may therefore
fitly call ours Churches. That which is objected against the word
Church, is, that Church signifies not a house of wood or stone, but
a society or fellowship of men, professing faith in Jesus Christ;
So also the word Synagogue signifies not a building, but such an
assembly or society likewise; <HI>In the ordinary signification</HI> (saith
<HI>Spanhemius) Synagogue signifies the assembly, not the place where
they assemble, but in the New Testament it is sometimes put for the
place of assembling,</HI> Luke 7. 5. Acts 18. 7. Synagogue, and
Church, are one and the same, both signifie the assembly met;
As the one, so also the other may be applied by an usual figure
to the place of meeting, and therefore where it is said,
<HI>the Centurion loveth our Nation, and hath built us a Syna∣gogue,</HI>
Luke 7. 5. the last Annotations have it, <HI>a Church;</HI>
So that they that would reforme this language, which calls
our places of meeting a Church, must reform the language
of Scripture, which calls the like places by a name of the same
signification.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it is a pious work to erect these Churches, or publick
meeting places for advancement of the knowledge and wor∣ship
of God, as may be evinced from that Narrative of the Cen∣turion,
<HI>Luke</HI> 7. and the transactions between Christ and him.
1. There are several evidences of piety in the man. 1. He is tender∣ly
affected with his servants sicknesse. 2. He sends to Christ for
<PB N="402" REF="229"/>
cure, makes to him as <HI>Mary</HI> for <HI>Lazarus.</HI> 3. He evidences a
mighty faith in Christ, beleeves that Christs word without his
presence will work for his servants recovery. 4. Makes this good
by an argument from the lesse to the greater, <HI>I my selfe am a man
under authority, and have men under me,</HI> if my word stands, who
am an inferiour person, how much more then thine? 5. The Lord
Christ speaks by way of commendation and admiration of his
faith, <HI>ver.</HI> 9. 2. There are evidences of the warranty of his fact.
1. The Elders of the Jewes take notice of it, and upon this ac∣count
commend him to Christ to have his request gratified, <HI>Lord,
he is worthy for whom thou shouldest do this: For he loveth our
Nation, and hath built us a Synagogue.</HI> 2. This takes with Christ,
<HI>Then Jesus went with them.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, being a pious work as we see to erect them (not only
in the judgement of this Centurion, but of the Jewes, yea and of
Christ Jesus) it is then an evil, a sinne to demolish and destroy
them, this followes from the former; If piety let them up, sinne
pulls them down: If he be a good Townsman that builds a Market∣house,
a School, &amp;c. then he is an ill-deserving one that does ru∣ine
it. If the Centurion have his praise for building a Synagogue,
then it must be their reproach that deface them. Farther we have
a sad complaint of such acts of Sacriledge done by adversaries, ene∣mies,
blasphemers, <HI>Psal. 74. 7, 8. They have cast fire into
thy Sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place
of thy name to the ground: They have burnt up all the Synagogues of
God in the Land.</HI> The burning of the Temple in the first place
is complained of, the dwelling place of Gods name. Then
of the Synagogues which were scattered through the Land,
all these were destroyed and consumed. This the godly
lay to heart, as a sore evil, and complaine of it heavily and
sadly.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ministry maintenance asserted.</NOTE> As to the revenue for maintenance of those that at∣tend
upon this worship, I might speak, 1. To that which is con∣scienciously
due,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. What con∣scientiously is due.</NOTE> in which the minde of God is, that it be not de∣tained,
as might be made good, 1. By the Apostles authority.
2. By his Arguments and Reasons. 1. By his authority, <HI>Gal. 6.
6. Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things.</HI> Subsistence is of due to him that tea∣cheth
from them that are taught according to their abilities, and
<PB N="403" REF="229"/>
the proportion of their possessions. This is no almes or free gift,
but a due debt. The Apostle gives it in charge, and takes off ex∣cuses
and evasions in the words that follow; <HI>Be not deceived, God
is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reape.</HI>
And as the Apostle by his authority orders it, so he gives his rea∣sons
for it, which might be enlarged to a great length from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>
9. He first argues from the practice of other Apostles, of all
the Apostles except himself and <HI>Barnabas, ver. 5, 6. I only and</HI>
Barnabas <HI>have we not power to forbear working?</HI> 2. He argues from a
civil right and common equity in three particular instances, <HI>ver.</HI> 7.
1. In Souldiers, <HI>Who goeth a warfarre at any time at his own char∣ges?</HI>
2. In Husbandmen, <HI>Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth
not of the fruit thereof.</HI> 3. In Shepherds, <HI>Who feedeth a flock, and
eateth not of the milke of the flock?</HI> All these live of their labours,
Ministers who undergo equal labours must live of theirs. Third∣ly,
he argues from the command of the Law, <HI>ver. 8, 9. Say I
these things as a man? or saith not the Law the same also? For it
is written in the Law of</HI> Moses, <HI>thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of
the Oxe that treadeth out the corne. Doth God take care for Oxen?</HI>
Where two observations are cleare. 1. The Law of force is to
Christians; and secondly, Ministers must live on their Ministerial
pains. Fourthly, he reasons from communicative justice, <HI>ver. 11. If
we have sown unto you spiritual things, it is a great thing if we shall
reap your carnal things?</HI> Whence three things are clear. 1. That
the things of earth carry no proportion with the things of hea∣ven.
2. By the Ministery of the Word the things of heaven are
conferred. 3. When Ministers conferre on their people the
things of heaven, there is all equity that they should receive the
things of earth. Fifthly, he argues from the provision made in
the Law, <HI>ver. 13. Do ye not know, that they which minister about
holy things, live of the things of the Temple? And they which wait
at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar?</HI> If the Law judge it
equal for the Levites, to live on the paines that they take about
holy things, then it is equal that the Ministers of the Gospel live of
their paines, But the Law made such provision for the Levites, not
with an hungry, narrow proportion, but in a liberal and honoura∣ble
way; See Doctor <HI>Reynolds</HI> on <HI>Psal. 110. pag.</HI> 478. Sixthly, he
argues from Christs institution in a parallel way, <HI>ver. 14. Even so
hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel should live
<PB N="444" REF="230"/>
of the Gospel;</HI> whence we see at large that it is the minde of Christ
that this be not detained in case the Apostle (as he sayes, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>
2. 16.) hath the minde of Christ.</P>
<P>For that which is legally due either by order of the Sate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. What is le∣gally due.</NOTE> or a vo∣luntary
gift of any person, to that end, it ought not to be aliena∣ted;
There is equity in the thing (as we have heard at large)
when authority shall put upon it their sanction, it is a farther con∣firmation;
for a voluntary gift, in case <HI>Ananias</HI> may not revoke
his own, none may alienate anothers; <HI>If it be a mans Testament,
no man disanulleth it,</HI> Gal. 3. 14. The poore must enjoy that
which by free gift is setled upon them, so a Corporation, and
so the Ministery in like manner. To destroy publick places (of
necessary and convenient use) for advancement of publick wor∣ship,
to alienate lively-hood which is in order to it, is
to devoure that which is holy, reductively holy: not
by Gods particular institution, with limit to that
thing or place, but by his Warranty and approba∣tion.</P>
<P>Separation of persons, for God is of another sort; they that
are thus separate, God ownes; not only as reductively, but re∣latively
holy: This is either peculiarly, in some way of special
calling, to do such work as is holy, of which there were several
sorts in the time of the Law, Priests, Levites, Nazarites, Singers,
Porters, which will not be denied, and in a parallel way Ministers
of the Gospel as we have seen, 1 <HI>Cor. 9. 14. Acts 13. 2. The
Holy Ghost said, Separate me</HI> Saul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>for the work where∣unto
I have called them.</HI></P>
<P>Here an eminent adversary gives in his assent, and sayes, <HI>Pastors
and Teachers, or Presbyters to teach, and governe the Church of
God; I am assured are a divine institution, and a very merciful gift
of Christ,</HI> Ephes. 4. 11, 12, 13. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Acts 14. 23.
1 Tim. 3. 1. Titus 2. 5. <HI>to whom people should yield obedience,</HI>
Heb. 13. 7. <HI>and yield maintenance liberally,</HI> 1 Cor. 9. 14. Gal. 6.
6. 1 Tim. 5. 17, 18. <HI>If any go about to extirpate them, let him
be accursed as an enemy to Christ and his Church.</HI> This the evidence
of truth forces him to confesse, though presently he takes againe
all that from them, which he had under such an Anathema yield∣ed
them. He that gives to every Free-man of <HI>London,</HI> in case
competently qualified, the whole power and authority of the
<PB N="445" REF="230"/>
Lord Major, to every free Subject of <HI>England,</HI> the whole power
of the Lord Chief Justice, goes a destructive way for extirpation
of those places, or functions. This I think all will grant, when
each man may do their work, they shall soon have little honour
in the naked title. Now our Authour gives the work of preach∣ing
promiscuously to all. <HI>Notwithstanding what such and such have
said, I still conceive</HI> (saith he) <HI>that not onely for triall of expect∣ants,
but also upon other occasions, persons not ordained, may be per∣mitted,
yea desired to preach in the Pulpits.</HI> If all that such have said
cannot withstand this conceit, me thinkes his Anathema (but
now pronounced) should affect him somewhat. Let him take
heed lest he let them loose to runne upon so heavy a curse that
hangs over those of such principles. It were to be wished he
would have answered their reasons in a better temper than he
hath done other mens, or have given in somewhat of his own far∣ther
than his bare conceit. I confesse, he speakes somewhat by way
of caution. <HI>Neverthelesse I am against the courses of many Soul∣diers,
and others who against the denial of able Teachers, to whom
the teaching of the people is committed, love to get into the Pulpits
of the ablest men, to vent their peculiar conceits, and often-times
their pernicious Errors, not regarding to preach to the ignorant the
clear Truths of Faith, and a holy life in places where they have no
Preacher, but to new Converts; to pervert them, and with-draw
them from their able Teachers, and to disquiet them and their Con∣gregations
by frivolous exceptions.</HI> If they have but their liberty
to become Pulpit-men, and may consecrate themselves without
laying on of hands (which is confest to be of divine institution)
they will soon be their own carvers for the choise of Pulpits, They
will be the judges of the ability or insufficiency of Ministers gifts
where they quarter. All shall be clear truths that they vent;
Break down the Apostles fence, that by appointment from Jesus
Christ he hath set up, <HI>Let them be proved, and then do the office,</HI>
and then a mound, Segges and Bul-rushes will soon be trodden
down. The God of order hath taken more care; The dispen∣sation
of the Sacraments is with these every mans work, as well as
preaching the Word, which he notably proves against Master
<HI>Baxter. Doth the Embassage of Christ, dispensing of his mysteries,
beseeching in his stead, &amp;c. consist</HI> (saith one) <HI>in breaking bread,
delivering it; bidding, take, eat, &amp;c? If it do, then a non-preaching
<PB N="406" REF="231"/>
Minister who doth these things, may yet be an Embassador of Christ,
and Steward of his mysteries; then the breaking bread, &amp;c. is a con∣verting
Ordinance, as Mr.</HI> Pryn <HI>held, which Mr.</HI> Gillespy <HI>and
Mr.</HI> Rutherford <HI>deny.</HI></P>
<P>If it be granted that this is the whole of a Ministers work, is it
no part of it? are they to do nothing else, if they are to do this?
If it be an edifying Ordinance (which neither Master <HI>Gillespy</HI> nor
Master <HI>Rutherford</HI> will deny) it is a part of their function. <HI>For
my part,</HI> (saith he) <HI>I think to be an Embassador of Christ, and to
beseech in his stead,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <HI>to be a Steward of the mysteries of
God,</HI> 1 Cor. 4. 1. <HI>are all one, as to preach the Gospel, and that the
Assembly did misalledge the Text,</HI> 1 Cor. 4. 1. <HI>as they have done
the other, to prove that neither Sacrament may be dispensed by any,
but a Minister of the Word lawfully ordained,</HI> Confession of Faith,
<HI>Chap. 27. Sect.</HI> 4. Perhaps when the Assembly voted that Text
for this purpose, they had read that which our Author elsewhere
delivers, speaking of admission to Baptisme, he saith, <HI>A Minister
in this case is to act as a Steward, who is to deale according to his
Lords will, not his own minde.</HI> Is not Baptisme then one of the
mysteries of which they are Stewards? or perhaps they thought
that the Sacraments are contained in the Gospel, and are <HI>verbum
visibile,</HI> being teaching signes. A man that will oppose so quick-sighted
a Society, should have said some little at least to purpose;
It is said, that <HI>Mysteries of God never signifie Sacraments in Scri∣pture,
but the Gospel, Ephes. 6. 19. Rom.</HI> 16. 25. I never took
those to be opposites, but have ever thought that Sacraments are
included within the Gospel; we have ever taken them for signes
and Seales, and if they do not teach Gospel-truths, and seale
Gospel-promises, Ministers are not to dispense them, nor Chri∣stians
to intermeddle with them: But <HI>Chamiers</HI> authority is here
brought, <HI>in Scriptur is</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>usurpari pro ipso rei sacrae signo, pro∣fecto
impostura est.</HI> And is not the Quotation of this from him a
greater imposture, who ever took the bare signe to be the Sacra∣ment?
then the definition would fall that calls it a visi∣ble
signe of an invisible grace. If marriage be not that
great mystery, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5. 32. but the union of Christ and his
Church, then certainly the Sacraments (in which we have that
communion and fellowship with Christ) 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 16.) are not
excluded from the number of mysteries.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="231"/>
As there is a separation for this publick work, so there is also
a separation more general, from Idols to God, upon which ac∣count
Christians are called Saints. Men holy by dedication to the
Lord, <HI>as the Temple of God which is holy,</HI> 1 Cor. 3. 17. Our ad∣versaries
some of them at least baptize, and by Baptisme conse∣crate
men to God, upon no other account than such a separati∣on
by a profession of Faith and holinesse, as some of the most e∣minent
of them expresse themselves. To deny Baptisme to these
in their own account, can be no other than Sacriledge. This
profession gives them interest in God by way of visible commu∣nion;
and therefore they must be given to God. Children are
separated for God, and stiled (as we have heard) holy; if they
yield them this interest, they cannot deny them Baptisme, and
avoid this charge of Sacriledg, They are servants of God and of his
holy Family, and they are to have admittance into the Family.
In case they deny it, they must leave them <HI>without God,</HI> and so
<HI>without Hope;</HI> so that of necessity one will follow, that either
they robbe God of them as belonging to him, or denying their
interest in him, they doome them to destruction. If they have no
interest in God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quae sententia, tantum secum in vexit jam er∣rorum &amp; schis∣matum agmen, ut nihil de ullis superiorum temporum Hae reticis legatur tam insanum, quod non fuerit reductum proximo qua∣driennio subs{que} rursum sectato∣res invenerit, ut vel unum hoc pietatis studio∣sis radicem hanc suspectam meritò reddere debuerit, ex qua tam in fausta germina suppu∣lularunt.</NOTE> then they perish; If they have their interest, then
they are Sacrilegiously with-held from him. Many have obser∣ved
how God hath followed the sinne of Sacriledge, above other
sinnes with his judgements; but instances can be given of no piece
of Sacriledge, so sadly followed by the hand of heaven, as this
of deteining Infants from Baptisme. They have heard not a
few, and it may well move pity in all Readers to take notice of
their answers. No consent of History, nor authority of men,
of most eminent piety can work their belief of such a hand of
God, giving up so many of their party to such abominations.
I shall to that which they have heard from Master <HI>Marshal</HI> and
Master <HI>Baxter</HI> adde only one testimony of <HI>Martine Bucer</HI> in his
Dedicatory Epistle before his Comment on the Evangelists, rela∣ting
to the Doctrine of Antipaedo baptisme, he saith, <HI>Which opinion
hath brought such an heap of Errors, and Schismes, that there is no∣thing
so abhorrent from reason, can be read of any of the Hereticks of
former times, which hath not been in foure yeares space revived, and
sonud followers, that this alone may render that root suspected to all
that follow after godlinesse, from whence such unhappy branches have
sprouted, and out of which they have budded.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Children of all that are Christians in profession,
are by vertue of Covenant-Interest, to be received
into the Church by Baptisme.</HEAD>
<P>THen it farther followes by way of necessary Corollary, that
according to the Parents Interest in the Covenant, the childe
hath Interest in the Sacrament of Baptism; But all professing Pa∣rents
separate from Idols, and professing the worship of the true
God, though nothing more of a Christian be in them, in the lati∣tude
as hath been shewn, are in covenant; the infants of all these
then have interest in Baptisme. The Major cannot be questi∣oned
by any that acknowledge a right in infants, derived from
their Parents for Baptism, for it is interest in the covenant that
gives the title to parent and infant: The Minor I have abun∣dantly
proved. The covenant must either be made to appeare
to run in a more narrow channel (which I suppose will hardly
be done) that a man in Ignorance, or in Impenitency, as he does
not keep covenant, so he never entred covenant, or else this must
necessarily follow. To assert this by<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Arguments evincing the right of Chri∣stians in this latitude.</NOTE> Arguments.</P>
<P>First, Their children whom God owns as his peculiar people,
above others have right to Baptisme. This cannot be denied; ei∣ther
these have a just claim, or else no children at all. But God
owns all in visible profession, as his people, <HI>Isa. 1. 2. Isa. 5. 13.
Hos. 4. 6. Jer. 2. 11, 13, 31, 32. Jer. 4. 22. Jer.</HI> 5. 51. therefore the
children of visible professors have right to Baptism.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their children, that are brought forth to God, by
their parents, have right to Baptism; This is as plain: But visible
professors bring forth children to God, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 20. therefore
their children have right to Baptism.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Those children whose Parents are children of the
Kingdome of God, have their title to Baptisme; But those that
are in sin, and in a way to be cast out for sin, are children of the
Kingdome, <HI>Mat. 8. 12. Mat. 21. 43. Ergo</HI> the children of Pa∣rents
in sin have right to Baptism.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The children of those, who are themselves Disciples
of Christ, ought to be baptized; But men in sin are Disciples of
<PB N="449" REF="232"/>
Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6. 66. whole Nations, among whom are many wicked
ones, are Disciples, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19. The children then of those
that are in sinne, ought to be baptized.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The children of those that are of the number of bre∣thren
in the faith of the Gospel, have right to Baptism: But men
in sinne are brethren in the faith of the Gospel, 1 <HI>Cor. 5. 11. If any
that is called a brother, be a fornicatour, or covetous, or an idolater,
or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, &amp;c.</HI> This our dissent∣ing
brethren will not deny to be meant of Christians, therefore
their children are to be baptized.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Those children that are holy by reason of birth from
one or both beleeving parents, are to be baptized: But the chil∣dren
of those that are in sin may be holy by reason of birth of
one, or both beleeving parents, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 14. To clear this place,
which some weakly enough, have urged for the contrary▪ Let us
enquire who the Apostle means by a Beleever, and who he means
by an unbeliever, and this will soone be decided; if we look to
the case propounded by letter from the Corinthians, which he
there resolves, and answers their scruples; That is confest to be
marriage between a Christian and a Heathen a professed Believer
and an Infidel, a man removed from an Infidel, (to take upon him
the name of Christ), is there a Beleever, and many of these e∣ven
in <HI>Corinth,</HI> were men in sinne. They that will have the Be∣leever
there to set out only a justified and sanctified person, they
must by unbeleever mean all unsanctified persons, and so the case
propounded and satisfied, is, whether a regenerate person san∣ctified
by the Spirit, married to one that gives not full, or at
least hopeful evidences of sanctification, may continue a marri∣age-society?
whether a man of <HI>Jobs</HI> integrity might have lived
with such a wise to whom <HI>Job</HI> was joyned? a thing that was ne∣ver
yet brought into question, either by Jew or Christian; and
altogether unworthy of an Apostles determination. The thing is
plaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amplificati∣on of this po∣sition.</NOTE> that as infants have right to Baptisme, so all
the infants of those parents that <HI>nomine tenus</HI> are Christians,
have right to Baptism. See more, <HI>Treatise of the Sacraments,
page</HI> 161.</P>
<P>To amplifie this in some particulars, and if it may be, to make it
more clear to doubting Christians.</P>
<P>First, A life in distrust of God, and rebellion against God, provo∣king
<PB N="449" REF="233"/>
him to the highest punishment of the parents doth not divest
the child of the title to the covenant, and interest in the Sacrament
of initiation into the number of Christians. For proof of this,
look upon that act of <HI>Joshua,</HI> when the people were got out of
the Wildernesse, and were brought into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> Josh.
5. 6, 7. <HI>The children of</HI> Israel <HI>walked fourty yeers in the Wil∣dernesse,
till all the people that were men of warre that came out of</HI>
Egypt <HI>were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord;
And the children which he raised up in their stead, them did</HI> Joshua
<HI>circumcise, for they were uncircumcised, they had not circumcised them
in the way;</HI> you see what the fathers were, yet the children <HI>Joshua</HI>
ordered to be circumcised; Concerning their conversation, the pa∣rents
were enemies, but as touching the election, the choice made
of God, the issue is to be numbred among the beloved. Who
had a worse father than <HI>Josiah,</HI> yet where was there a better son?
A circumcised man, who in youth began <HI>to seek the God of his fa∣ther</HI>
David, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 34. 3.</P>
<P>Secondly, Misbelief in a parent divests not the issue of this
birth-priviledge; though the father erre in the faith, yet the child
is not to be shut out of the number of beleevers. We have in this
particular the Apostle for a precedent, had misbelief in the parent
denuded the childe of this priviledge. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> had not beene
<HI>a Jew by nature,</HI> but an Heretick, or Sectary by nature, being be∣fore
conversion a Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee; Scribe was a
name of office, but Pharisee the name of a Sect, and therefore Christ
warns to beware of the leaven, that is, of the Doctrine of the Pha∣risees,
as of the Sadduces; Such was <HI>Pauls</HI> parentage, and yet by
descent and off-spring, he is of the people of the Jewes. What we
say of Pharisees, is as true of Sadduces; It is not to be doubted
but they were circumcised persons, and entitled their children ac∣cording
to the Directory in Scripture for circumcision, as ap∣pears
by their embodying of themselves with the people of the
Jewes, <HI>Matth. 22. 23. Acts</HI> 23. 6. The most strict of Pharisees
took them into their society, which they had not done, had they
not been men of the circumcision, we see the accusation
charged on <HI>Peter</HI> on this occasion, <HI>Acts</HI> 11. 2, 3. A man
transmits not his errors, nor his vices no more than he doth his
graces.</P>
<P>Thirdly, ignorance of needful truths, in a parent doth not di∣vest
<PB N="450" REF="233"/>
the childe of this priviledge. Those were the people of
God (and therefore brought forth children to God) that did pe∣rish
for lack of knowledge, <HI>Hosea</HI> 4. 6. that went into capti∣vity
for lack of knowledge, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. A reverend brother, giving
his reasons why he is among his brethren singular in this point,
not baptizing all born in his Parish; one maine one is, the grosse
ignorance among them, and that (as he sayes) <HI>not in Cumberland,
and those parts, but in Essex, such, that if he should print, his Rea∣der
would scaree beleeve it were possible to be true;</HI> To which I
only say, I wish that our own experience in the places where we
live, did give us occasion of suspition, that any wrong is done
them. Therefore to let the truth passe unquestioned, I would only
wish him to consider, whether there might not have been found
the like in <HI>Corinth,</HI> that Church of the Saints, 1 <HI>Cor. 15. 34. Some
have not the knowledge of God, I speak this to your shame.</HI> Whe∣ther
there he might not have found the like among the illumina∣ted
Hebrews, were not there those that were <HI>dull of hearing, that
when for the time they ought to be teachers, they had need that one
teach them againe, which be the first principles of the Oracles of
God, and were become such as had need of milke, and not of strong
meat?</HI> yet these were of the Church, and therefore with them their
children.</P>
<P>Fourthly, illegitimation of birth, adulterous copulation in the
parents, divesteth not such issue of this priviledge, <HI>David</HI> had ne∣ver
in that manner sought in fasting and prayer his childes life,
had he believed that he must not have been of the seed of the Jews,
but of the uncircumcised Heathen; <HI>Pharez</HI> was of such a birth, yet
who bore a greater name and glory in <HI>Israel</HI> than he, and his fa∣mily?
even where the illegitimation of his birth is noted, there
the glory of his race is magnified, which is yet farther honoured
in that Christ according to the flesh was made of his seed. That
seed of <HI>Abraham per eminentiam,</HI> was out of his loynes; <HI>Jepthah</HI>
indeed was driven out by his brethren, but not because that he
was not of the seed of the Jews, and people of God, but because
they would not have him to share of the inheritance among them.
A Reverend Divine saith,<MILESTONE UNIT="Objections an∣swered."/> <HI>That some persons may be noto∣rious
offenders (as known Atheists, mockers of Religion, Idolaters,
Papists, Hereticks, Witches) and yet professe before men the faith,
seemes to him to imply a contradiction.</HI> These (I confesse) are plau∣sible
<PB N="452" REF="234"/>
words to take with well-meaning souls, that attend not to
the language of the Scripture in this particular. And for the first,
if he meanes <HI>Atheists</HI> in judgement, that professedly main∣taine
in word, what <HI>Davids</HI> fool said in his heart, <HI>that there
is no God,</HI> and by mockers of Religion, not those alone that op∣pose
the power, but with <HI>Lucian,</HI> all notion of Religion; and by
Idolaters, those that professedly worship false gods, and worship
not at all the Lord Jehovah, then it cannot be denied▪ that this is
a contradiction: But Reverend Master <HI>Rutherford,</HI> whom he op∣poseth
in that place▪ hath no such meaning; But for an Atheist in
life, to be a professour of the faith, we have <HI>Paul</HI> expressely for it,
<HI>Titus 1. 16. They professe that they know God, but in works they deny
him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
reprobate.</HI> The Apostle (we see) saw no contradiction in it; and
for mockers of Religion, <HI>Peter</HI> did not foretell them to be out of
the Church, but within the bosome of it, when he said, <HI>There shall
come in the last dayes scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</HI> 2 Pet.
3, 3. For Idolaters, if an Israelite might be an Idolater, then a
Christian; How high were those in Idolatry mentioned, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.
36, 37, 38, 39? and yet in covenant, <HI>ver.</HI> 45. For the Church of
<HI>Corinth</HI> the Apostle is plaine, A brother may be an Idolater, 1
<HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 11. It is within the Church, and not without, where
men escape death by plagues, <HI>yet repent not of the works of their
hands, that they should not worship Devils, and Idols of gold, and
silver, and brasse, and stone, and of wood, which neither can see, nor
heare, nor walke,</HI> Rev 9. 20. For Papists, I marvel how they
are distinguished from Idolaters and Hereticks; for Hereticks as
false Prophets were of the Church of the Jewes, so Hereticks are
of the Church in Gospel-times, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 1. The Apostle tells
the Elders of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> Acts 20. 30. <HI>Of your own selves shall men
arise, speaking perverse things to draw away Disciples after them.</HI>
For Witches, though there were a Law in <HI>Israel</HI> not to suffer a
Witch to live, <HI>Exod.</HI> 22. 18. Yet <HI>Israel</HI> had Witches, as is seen
in those that <HI>Saul</HI> put out of the Land, and her that in his distresse
he sought unto, 1 <HI>Sam. 28. Paul</HI> had never reckoned up witch∣craft
among those sinnes that shut out of the Kingdome of hea∣ven,
and certified the Churches of <HI>Galatia</HI> of it, had there been
an impossibility that any such should be found of their number
that made claime to it; This the Reverend Authour doth as
<PB N="453" REF="234"/>
much as acknowledge in the words that follow, <HI>I deny not</HI> (saith
he) <HI>but that in some sense, any such notorious offendor may have the
essence and being of a member of the Church as visible, to wit, in
this sense a corrupt and rotten member fit to be cut off. A member
of the visible Church, (though formerly an inoffensive professor of
the faith) may afterwards fall away into any of these notorious scan∣dals,
and yet for a while still retain the essence and being of a member
of the Church as visible.</HI> Master <HI>Rutherford</HI> that is there opposed
(I suppose) will affirme no more, Respective to the power of
godlinesse, there is in them no soundnesse, nor yet in those that
are better than these; Some say <HI>that one that is such in any known
foule sinne, to them is no better than a Heathen, as bad as a Turke,
or Pagan, and nothing at all better for the name Christian.</HI> And I
say, that to me they are as bad, as to them, and perhaps worse
in the eyes of God. This priviledge in which they stand thus in∣teressed,
is an aggravation of their sinne, and a farther provoca∣tion
of God against them; <HI>When the Lord saw it, he abhorred
them, because of the provoking of his sonnes and of his daughters,</HI>
Deut. 32. 19. yet such is Gods long-suffering, and forbearance
of them, that he is pleased to vouchsafe them farther and more
large evidences of his favour, <HI>Nehem.</HI> 9. 30. Hierusalem <HI>was
corrupted more than</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Samaria, <HI>in all her wayes,</HI> Ezek.
16. 47. Sodom <HI>and her daughters, had not done as</HI> Hierusalem
<HI>and her daughters,</HI> ver. 48. Samaria <HI>had not committed halfe her
sinnes,</HI> ver. 51. In her abominations she had justified both of
them; yet <HI>Hierusalem</HI> enjoyed those priviledges, that <HI>Samaria</HI>
and <HI>Sodom</HI> enjoyed not; <HI>Hierusalem</HI> was in covenant, <HI>ver.</HI> 16.
when <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Samaria</HI> were no covenant-people, but worship∣ped
they knew not what, <HI>John 4. ver. 22. Corazin</HI> and <HI>Beth∣saida,</HI> Cities of <HI>Israel,</HI> were no better in the eye of God than <HI>Ty∣re</HI>
and <HI>Sidon,</HI> yea their sinnes deserved an heavier weight of
judgement, <HI>Matth. 11. 22. It shall be more tolerable for</HI> Tyre
<HI>and</HI> Sydon <HI>at the day of judgement, than for you,</HI> saith our Saviour;
and so it was with <HI>Capernaum,</HI> compared to <HI>Sodom,</HI> ver. 23. yet
<HI>Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum,</HI> enjoyed those priviledges from
God, that <HI>Tyre, Sydon</HI> and <HI>Sodom</HI> wanted. As the Apostles zeal
against the Samaritanes▪ sinnes, <HI>Luke</HI> 9. 54, did out-strip our
Saviours, when they would have fire from heaven to consume
them; so our zeale out-goes Gods, when we would have such
<PB N="453" REF="235"/>
men, root and branch, parent and child struck out of covenant, be∣fore
God hath sued out any Bill of divorce against them, or remo∣ved
his Candlestick, and taken all covenant-priviledges from them.
For the baptism of children of Apostates, there is a greater difficul∣ty.
Some of reverend worth say, <HI>They see not how justly a Parents
Apostasy should deprive the childe of Baptisme,</HI> and some Texts of
Scripture seem strongly to favour that opinion, <HI>Ezek. 16. 20, 21.
Moreover, thou hast taken thy sonnes and thy daughters whom thou
hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be de∣voured;
Is this of thy whoredomes a small matter, that thou hast
slain my children, and delivered them, to cause them to passe through
the fire for them?</HI></P>
<P>There could not be an higher evidence of Apostacy, than to
give their children in sacrifice to a false god. It was one of the
highest acts of obedience that <HI>Abraham</HI> could testifie to the
Lord, and yet these yield it to Idol-gods; <HI>They bring forth chil∣dren
to God, and give them to</HI> Moloch, <HI>Psal. 106. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.
They were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works, and
they served their Idols, which were a snare unto them, yea they sa∣crificed
their sons and daughters unto devils. And shod innocent blood,
even the blood of their sonnes and of their daughters, whom they sa∣crificed
unto the Idols of</HI> Canaan, <HI>and the land was polluted with
blood. Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a who∣ring
with their own inventions.</HI> These in this apostatized from God
in covenant, yet God lookes upon them as a covenant people,
<HI>ver. 45. And he remembred for them his covenant, &amp;c.</HI> But
this seemes to be but a partial Apostasy, taking in the worship of
Idols, they did not totally cast off the worship of God. A line
of profession was still (it seemes) held up, God was not whol∣ly
cast off in <HI>Judah.</HI> They seem to be of those, <HI>that swore by the
Lord and</HI> Malcham, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 1. 5. keeping up the worship of the
true God, and yet take in the worship of a false god with him.
As for those in whom Master <HI>Firmin</HI> instanceth; our Englishmen
now in <HI>Turkey,</HI> apostatized from the Faith to that Religion;
concerning whom quaeres are often put, it may seem equal, that as
a man comes into covenant, and his posterity with him; So, to∣tally
rejecting the covenant, denying God as well in profession,
as in his works; that he and his posterity should be out of cove∣nant;
Being before an holy root, to transmit holinesse to his
<PB N="454" REF="235"/>
seed, now he becomes unholy, and put out of such capacity, and
is disabled from making over any such priviledge to them. But
here we need not to trouble our selves with the Baptisme of such,
having renounced Christ, they baptize not their infants in his
name. A Minister shall have none of these rendered to him, and
to baptize them into this body, when he well knowes they must
be never suffered to be of it, were an high taking of Gods name
in vaine, and a mockery of so sacred an Ordinance. Now in
case a grandfather shall take one of these children, and offer it
unto Baptisme; and being a Progenitor, shall undertake the e∣ducation
in the Christian Faith, and not in the Turkish abomina∣tion,
whether in this case there be right to Baptisme, is the que∣stion.
Now these may be looked upon, either as meer Heathens,
in the same condition, as if they never had an Ancestor in the
Faith, or else as issuing out of the loynes of mediate Ancestors,
believing, and so coming from a root that hath been holy. If
considered in the former way, they may have a title to Baptisme
according to many eminent Divines, by vertue of their Adoption.
Reverend Master <HI>Cawdrey</HI> observes a three-fold way to circum∣cision
from <HI>Gen. 17. One is personal upon profession of Faith
in a mans own person,</HI> so <HI>Abraham</HI> entered. <HI>A second is pa∣ternal,
when a man comes in by right derived from his Parents,</HI>
so <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Ishmael</HI> had title. <HI>A third, adoptive, being ta∣ken
into the family of a Beleever according to that,</HI> Gen. 17.
12, 13. <HI>He that is eight dayes old among you, shall be cir∣cumcised,
every man childe in your generations, be that is born
in the house, or bought with money of any stranger which is not
of thy seed. He that is borne in thy house, and he that is bought
with thy money, must needs be circumcised, &amp;c.</HI> Any bond∣man
that he would take, and adopt into his family, in such case
had right of circumcision: <HI>Rive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> on <HI>Gen. 17. Exercit. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> is
cleare of this judgement, and sayes, he remembers that it was
so determined in the National Synods of the <HI>French</HI> Churches,
quoting in like manner <HI>Prosper</HI> in his second Book, <HI>De vocatione
gentium,</HI> Chap. 8.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Aliquando filiis infidelium praestatur baec gratia ut bapti∣zentur cúm oc∣cultâ Dei pro∣videntiâ in manus piorum quomodocunque proveniunt.</NOTE> <HI>Sometimes this priviledge is vouchsafed
to the children of Infidels, when by a secret providence they
into the hands of the godly.</HI> Master <HI>Cotton</HI> I remember in his
book of Infant-Baptisme is for it. Master <HI>Norton</HI> against <HI>A∣pollonius</HI>
for present suspends his judgement, <HI>page</HI> 38. I had ra∣ther
<PB N="456" REF="236"/>
go his way, than theirs that determine it; and in my
thoughts with submission to better judgements, I rather in∣cline
in present to the contrary. Those that <HI>Abraham</HI> bought
with his money, I suppose were men of years, who were to
be circumcised and their issue; But whether they were not
first instructed, is the question. No uncircumcised person was
to be in his house, and whether he might compel to circum∣cision
may well be disputed. He found them explicitely in
covenant with false gods, and whether he might give them
the seale of the covenant of the true God in that state, I
question. It is said, <HI>Gods covenant shall be in their flesh,</HI> verse
13. and that this should be done, and no covenant with the
true God at all professedly in their mouth, no notion of
him by way of assent in their heart, to me is strange; I
think it implies <HI>Abrahams</HI> work, first in instructing of them
in the covenant, and upon their assent they were received,
and their seed with them. Circumcision did denominate
them a people of God, and that is a strong contradiction
to have them circumcised, whose faith was in a false god;
and who applied themselves to such worship; Their en∣trance
I should rather take to be personal, than adoptive.
Consider them then as descending from the loynes of Chri∣stian
progenitors, having fathers of their flesh heretofore in
covenant with God, and we shall finde them in a better
condition than those Heathens that had ever been strangers.
And here the Apostle will help us to a distinction, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.
28. Speaking of the Jewes cut off from the body of the
Church visible. <HI>As concerning the Gospel,</HI> (saith he) <HI>they are
enemies for your sakes.</HI> Their present condition is as Hea∣thens,
being alienated from God by reason of unbelief of the
Gospel (which Apostasy of theirs hath given occasion to, and
made way for the calling of the Gentiles:) <HI>But as touching
the Election, they are friends,</HI> saith he; God hath respect to
them, not totally to reject them <HI>for their fathers sake;</HI> for
the covenant which he entered with, and the love that he
shewed unto their fore-fathers, being beloved upon the ac∣count
of their fathers; When there is a father found to do
them that office, to take them out of the wild Olive, to put
them into the true Olive; I do not doubt, but that they
<PB N="467" REF="236"/>
have title: Though Baptisme should be denied to infants res∣pective
to all predecessors, pure Heathen (notwithstanding A∣doption,
which I will not determine) yet the Apostle speaking
so much in favour of Jewes, even in their state of blindnesse,
respective to the hope of their future call; I do not doubt but it
might be vouchsafed (upon this account of Adoption) to an
infant. Jew, if we can have any ground fairely to conclude his
descent from <HI>Abraham,</HI> much more where we can easily evi∣dence
a descent from parents that are Christian. And this I hope
is
some explication of my meaning where in answer to the de∣mand
of an adversary I say, <HI>That infants be capable of Baptism,
by descent from parents, either within mans memory, or beyond
it; when a line of profession holdi, or is againe restored, that
the infants may be received into the visible Church, and enjoy
the saving Ordinances of Christ Jesus, page</HI> 68. of my answer;
and some satisfaction to the question concerning the power of
mediate Parents, giving title to Baptisme, where out of the case
of total Apostasy there is small difficulty. I shall conclude in the
words of <HI>Rivet,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Si Parens carens verâ fi∣de, cam tamen profiteatur &amp; in externo Ec∣lesiae coetupro fideli habeatur, aut olim habi∣tus fuerit sub veteri Testa∣mento infantes ex talibus nas∣centes erant foederati &amp; promissionis participes; quia etiam promissio acceptata fluerit, à parentibus majoribus in gratiam nas∣citurae posteritatis cui non praejudicat immediati Parentis incredulitas aut hypocrisis quamdiu infans incredulitatem &amp; hypocrisin Parentis imitari non potest. <HI>Rivet.</HI> in <HI>Gen.

<HEAD>CHAP. LIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Defence of the former Doctrine respective to the lati∣tude
of Infant-Baptisme.</HEAD>
<P>A Reverend Authour putting it to the Question, <HI>Whether the
Ministers of</HI> England <HI>are bound by the Word of God to baptize
the children which say they beleeve in Jesus Christ, but are grossely
ignorant, scandalous in their conversations, scoffers at godlinesse,
and refuse to submit at Church-discipline?</HI> determining it in the
negative, a work most candidly carried on, must be ingeniously
acknowledged, yet a work in which the Authour appears rather
diffident, than confident, more in suspition, than assured of the
verity of his own tenent, or warranty of his present practice.
Sometimes he consesses himself at a disadvantage, and comes ve∣ry
weakly off it, <HI>page</HI> 13. Sometimes he calls for better fingers
to untie the knot that he meets with, <HI>page</HI> 32. Sometimes he e∣ven
yeelds all, as the state did stand not onely with the Jewes,
but also as it doth stand with us, though it ought <HI>de jure</HI> to be
otherwise, <HI>page</HI> 34. Sometimes he professes not to deny any
infants, but to delay them, <HI>page</HI> 42. Sometimes he sayes he had
rather grapple with those, who think he is too large, than with
those who judge him to be too streight, <HI>page.</HI> 43. Suspecting his
errour (as indeed it doth) if Scripture may determine) to lie
on that hand. I shall as briefly as may be take a view of it.
He premises two things, <HI>page</HI> 1, 2. for the clearing of the
question.</P>
<P>First, Premises two grounds, on which he builds his discourse;
2. Puts the Question as above; 3. Brings arguments sor the ne∣gative,
which I shall here take into consideration.</P>
<P>First, <HI>The infant that is to be baptized, if we consider it in it self
as abstracted from the parent, gives no reason for it selfe why it
should be baptized.</HI> This we willingly yield, the infant hath no in∣dependent
title, the right claimed is in relation to the parents,
and thence I inferre the infants right is somewhat, that parents
can transmit to their children that gives the title, otherwise they
might have regeneration from parents, as well as Baptisme. It is
not then inherent graces that we must look after, respective to
<PB N="469" REF="237"/>
the childes interest, but covenant-priviledge, covenant-holi∣nesse.</P>
<P>A second ground is inferred from the former. <HI>All children
then</HI> (saith he) <HI>are baptized by vertue of the parent, one or both, ever
considering the childe in relation to the parent, being the branch of
such a root, and so I take in the childe together with the parent.
Hence we say commonly, they must be children borne in the Church,
that is, of such parents as are members of the Church, being a society
of visible Saints joyned together, by way of covenant, to exercise an
holy communion with God in Christ, and so one with another, accord∣ing
to the order of the Gospel: for I presume none are so sottish to
understand a Church to be that place which by a Metonymy of the sub∣ject
we call a Church, nor the Parishes that men live in which ne∣ver
were of Ecolesiastical constitution.</HI> I am utterly to seek
what is meant by that place, which by a Metonymy of the
subject we call a Church: our meeting places seeme to be in∣tended,
but few children are borne there; and the Authonr
speaks of a Church where children are borne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covenant of Church-mem∣bers either ex∣plicite or im∣plicite.</NOTE> For the cove∣nant
of which he speaks one with another, according to the order
of the Gospel, which he seemes to understand of a Congrega∣tional
Church, constituting covenant, and puts into the definiti∣on
of a Church; this should not have been premised, but pro∣ved.
His adversaries in this thing, know no such explicite
covenant. If an implicite one will serve, then the Parish inha∣bitants
(which he sayes were never of Ecclesiastical constitution)
are all in covenant; Men that professe God in Christ, and by
vertue of conveniency of habitation, joyne in one, in the wor∣ship
of God, in the use of Ordinances, tacitely and implicitely
are in covenant together, and we take it to be no sottish thing
to esteeme these as Churches. If this be his meaning, to assert
onely an implicite covenant, where he sayes page 3. (<HI>This rule
warrants any Minister comfortably to administer that Ordinance,
Here is a parent, one or both visibly in covenant with God, and a
visible member of Christs Church; I do therefore administer the seal
of the covenant unto this infant by vertue of this parent, according
to that Command given to</HI> Abraham, <HI>the father of believers,
with whom when the Lord entered into covenant, and laid the foun∣dation
of the Church visible in his family, he took his seed into co∣venant
with him, and commanded that they with him should keep that
<PB N="470" REF="238"/>
Seale of his covenant,</HI>) we freely consent, and then the question is
determined in the affirmative; I am sure the Church of the Jewes
took in such by circumcision, that some would exclude
from Baptisme. In case he meanes an explicite Church-co∣venant,
over and above the covenant of grace, as the Jewes
had no such way, so neither had the Apostles or primitive Chri∣stians.
Those converts, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. did not that first day of their
conversion before their Baptisme set up Congregational Churches
with officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apostles and primitive Christians knew no expli¦cite Church-Covenant.</NOTE> they dwelt in many remote places at great distance
(whither they were to returne to their respective families,) and
therefore could not in this way embody themselves, in one di∣stinct
society for exercise of discipline. Assoon as the Eunuch
by <HI>Philips</HI> preaching of a Jewish proselyte, is made a Christian
Disciple, he saith to <HI>Philip, See, here is water, what doth hinder me
to be baptized?</HI> Acts 8. 36. Had <HI>Philip</HI> understood a necessity of
confederation into a Church-way, over and above the cove∣nant
of grace before Baptisme, he had doubtlesse informed him;
and as Christ sent the Leper that he had cleansed, to <HI>shew him∣selfe
to the Priest, and offer the gift that</HI> Moses <HI>had Commanded,</HI>
Matth. 8. 4. so <HI>Philip</HI> would have observed the Gospel-order
appointed, and have sent him to some particular constituted vi∣sible
Church, upon his covenant to have been received, and not
hand over head, upon his bare profession <HI>that he beleeved that Je∣sus
Christ is the Sonne of God,</HI> baptized him. When the Gentiles
had received the Holy Ghost, <HI>Peter</HI> said, <HI>Acts 10. 47. Can any
man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have re∣ceived
the Holy Ghost as well as we?</HI> had there been any such rule
of a Church-covenant, orderly to have preceded, he might
easily have seen that any man, upon that account might have
forbidden it. <HI>Paul</HI> had made much more haste (as I may say)
than good speed, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. In baptizing the Jaylour and his
houshold, in case Jesus had set down an order of a preconfedera∣tion
into a particular Church-society. Master <HI>Bartlet</HI> in his mo∣del
of the Congregational way, saith, <HI>that those particular instan∣ces
which are produced by divers reverend Divines, of the Eunuch,
Centurions, Jaylours Baptisme, though not belonging to any parti∣cular
Church against what we have laid down, are of little force and
validity, in regard that which was done to those persons was by the
hands of extraordinary officers, that were not tied to particular
<PB N="471" REF="238"/>
Churches, as ordinary Pastours and Teachers were then, and still are.</HI>
But these persons whom they thus baptized, were not persons
in any such extraordinary capacity, and they must come in, in
a Gospel-way. This might have priviledged the Leper cleansed
by Christ, from offering his gift appointed by <HI>Moses,</HI> as well as
it could priviledge these new Converts from any covenant-way
appointed by Christ; and the Eunuch saith, <HI>What doth hinder
me to be baptized?</HI> without mention of any special priviledge of
an officer extraordinary, in a way otherwise irregular. And the
like we may observe in the speech of <HI>Peter.</HI> (2.) They should
shew us where, when, and by what authority, any ordinary Pa∣stours
and Teachers tied themselves to such an order, to bring
men into a Congregational Church-way, and to baptize into such
particular Church Congregational, and not into the universal
Church visible. (3.) Those of his judgement, may do well
to give us their thoughts of their own Baptisme. They had no
independant right all their right was in relation to their pa∣rents.
Their parents were not (as we conceive) thus in any
particular Church federation, perhaps they were no fit persons in
their judgement for admission, neither were they baptized by the
hands of extraordinary Officers. If their Baptisme was null, then
they are yet to be baptized; if valid, they had then title to Ba∣ptisme,
and others in their condition are entitled. (4.) Then
it is in the power of man, at pleasure to keep parent and childe
from the priviledge of Ordinances, to have them passe as Hea∣thens
and Infidels, yea believing godly men and their children at
their courtesie, must be reputed either of the number of dogges
or of children, this cannot be denied. The majority of these
have power at pleasure of admission of members. And to be no
Church-member (with them) is the same as to be a Turke, or
Indian, <HI>page</HI> 9. And how different their judgements are, who
are fit to be received, and who are to be denied, is evident.
Some of no obscure note have affirmed, though minded, be con∣trary
minded, <HI>that to render a man capable of admission into Church-membership,
grace is not sufficient, but he must have expressions,</HI> and
so a fathers slow tongue, shall exclude his childe from admittance
into the fellowship of the Saints; when upon the other hand up∣on
the bare account of his fathers glib tongue, (though there be
scarce another commendable quality) another may be received,
<PB N="472" REF="239"/>
when these are not judged worthy of fellowship, who are
not of abilities to sit in judgemeut with the Congregation,
to admit members, to passe sentence upon delinquents, to
judge of Doctrines, not only to elect, but to ordain Pastours
and Church-Officers, we may easily guesse how many they
exclude as without, whom Christ receives. Such a way had it
been taken, had deprived the Church of an <HI>Hezekiah, Josiah,</HI>
and many others in their age renowned; How great a provoca∣tion
is this to such children when once of growth to joyne with
them with whom the Church rancks them? and to oppose with
the uttermost of fury, such that (after the revolution of so ma∣ny
generations inheriting that priviledge) now do debarre
them? And how great an encouragement to joyne with such in
all holinesse, with whom they are honoured with these privi∣ledges?</P>
<P>As to the second, whether the Ministers of <HI>England</HI> are bound
by the Word of God to baptize their children which say they be∣leeve
in Jesus Christ, but are grossely ignorant, scandalous in their
conversations, scoffers at godlinesse, and refuse to submit to
Church-Discipline. Our Authour puts a Question, <HI>What pa∣rent
do you mean; the immediate parent onely, or the predecessors?
For suppose the immediate parent be as your question mentions; yet
it may be the Grand-father, or some of the predecessors have been
godly.</HI> And farther sayes, <HI>I perceive diverse of our Divines help
themselves here, and some in discourse are content to lose that ground
of the immediate parent, and flie to this.</HI> Though I see no reason
that any should fly hither, in hope of help, yet it is strange to me
that he should stand for the immediate parent, excluding all me∣diate
predecessours, who hath said enough for their power in
giving of this interest to the children. He sayes, <HI>I do administer
the Seale of the covenant unto this childe by vertue of this pa∣rent,
according to that Command given to</HI> Abraham, <HI>the father
of Beleevers, with whom when the Lord entered into covenant, and
laid the foundation of the Church visible in his family, he took his seed
into covenant with him, and commanded that with him they should
keepe that Seale of his covenant,</HI> When God tooke <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
into covenant and his seed with him, it was not onely his
immediate seed, but the issue of his flesh at the greatest distance,
Gods covenant with <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> is mentioned in
<PB N="473" REF="239"/>
Gods apparition to <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 3. 6. and was pleaded by <HI>Mo∣ses</HI>
in his intercession with God for <HI>Israel,</HI> Exod. 32. 13. <HI>Moses</HI>
then, and all <HI>Israel</HI> were in this confederation of <HI>Abraham,</HI> yea
all <HI>Israel</HI> in succeeding ages, <HI>Levit.</HI> 26. 42. When the worst of
Jewes make that plea, that they are <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed, the Lord
Christ yields it, <HI>John</HI> 8. 37. and the Apostle concludes a holi∣nesse
in the whole body upon that account, that the root at such
a distance, <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> were holy, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 16.
I know not how we can bottome any thing upon the grand Char∣ter
of God, made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and exclude the mediate parent
from all power to conferre this interest upon posterity. When <HI>Ja∣cob</HI>
calls <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasseh</HI> by the name of sonnes. <HI>Gen.</HI>
48. 9. as a father gives his blessing to them, putting his name,
and the names of his fathers, <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI> upon them, <HI>ver.</HI>
16. and 20. were they not to be reckoned for the sonnes and seed
of <HI>Jacob?</HI> doth not their mediate Parent, as well as <HI>Joseph</HI> their
immediate Father, conferre an interest on them? Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> was
before our Authour in this tenent, and his grounds are fully
answered by Mr. <HI>Caudrey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Firmins</HI> reasons and his replies to them.</NOTE> in his <HI>Diatribe,</HI> concerning in∣fant-baptisme.
I shall onely take into consideration our Authors
Reasons.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> <HI>he yields that</HI> England had Christians in Primitive∣times.
Thousands of Martyrs under <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> but after the
waters grew brackish at <HI>Rome, and brings it to us in</HI> England;
we held (<HI>saith he</HI>) the name Christianity under the <HI>Romish</HI> yoke,
till of late the State threw it off, and then the people following
the State concluding, I doubt not but God had his number in
those dark times; but what were those few in comparison of the
body of the people, or predecessours, since the time of the Gospel
restored to its purity; God hath wonderfully appeared in
<HI>England;</HI> but those who use the argument of predecessours runne
very high.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. If the waters grew brackish at <HI>Rome,</HI> so that they
gave their sent hither; so did the waters of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
grow as brackish, yea, and of a worse savour in the dayes of
<HI>Ahaz;</HI> and at those times when they brought forth children to
God and gave them to <HI>Moloch, Ezek.</HI> 16. 20.</P>
<P>2. Neither do we look so farre back (when we look back as
farre as <HI>Dioclesian</HI>) as the Jewes in Christ time; as <HI>Paul</HI> that
<PB N="464" REF="240"/>
looked as farre as <HI>Abraham</HI> in his time: yea, himself stayes not
till he come up to him, we are not necessitated to look so high.
A pedigree in a shorter line as to this purpose will serve our turne;
we are not tied to make it out that our Progenitors were really
godly, to conferre such covenant-interest upon us. Primitive-Christians
were admitted upon the account of Profession, by our
Authours confession, and not upon the account of reality of god∣linesse,
and they gave their posterity interest. We see how
much reverend Master <HI>Hooker.</HI> speaking the opinion of his party,
gives to the Churches connivance, negligence, or indulgence in
this thing: <HI>If the Church</HI> (saith he) <HI>either through connivance,
negligence, or indulgence shall tolerate such evils, and evil persons
in that state of Church-membership, they cannot then deny them the
priviledge of Members.</HI> And I dare attribute as much to Gods
connivance, his indulgence, and long suffering; Till he sue
out a bill of divorce, and openly casts a people off, (that they
be none of his Kingdome, or called by his name,) they are in co∣venant,
and their children with them. It seems Master <HI>Hooker</HI>
judges that the Church may thus connive without sinne; seeing
he distinguisheth between connivance, indulgence, and negli∣gence.
I am sure God may, out of just prerogative; And to
have the line broken off, assoon as the power of godlinesse, in a
race declines, is to be infinitely above God, rigorous, and se∣vere,
and the ready way to bring in a strange and monstrous
confusion. He goes on, and sayes <HI>he will a little consider the
Text in reference to them;</HI> and then instances in that in the second
Commandment, <HI>shewing mercy unto thousands, of them that
love me, and keep my Commandments,</HI> as though that were the
alone Text we had, to rest upon. Though much might be spoke
by way of Animadversion of his Answer, yet I forbeare. Use
may be made of that Text, to evidence that it is no unreasonable
thing to carry on a priviledge so farre, from generation
to generation, and an easie reply made to most that he
hath spoken; Yet I build not a formal Argument upon it,
therefore I shall not spend time in it. His second, third
and fourth Argument come in to fill up his Comment on
that Text,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2, 3, 4.</NOTE> and therefore might have been answers, not Ar∣guments.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> he sayes, <HI>that Text,</HI> 1 Cor. 7. 14. <HI>seemes to tie the
<PB N="465" REF="240"/>
federal holinesse of the childe to the immediate parent; doth not say,
the child is holy, &amp;c. by vertue of a great grandfather:</HI> And so it
seemes to me also. Those <HI>Corinthians</HI> being new Converts, their
issue had none but immediate Parents, from whom they might
claime their interest; and by whom they might be entitled. As
the Parents themselves did claime it from no Parents or Progeni∣tours
at all, their Ancestours having no power to communicate
it; <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Ishmael</HI> had right of circumcision onely from their
immediate Parent; <HI>Abraham</HI> had right immediately from God,
<HI>Jacob</HI> and his posterity had right from Parents, both mediate and
immediate, and these <HI>Corinthians</HI> from their immediate Pa∣rents
onely, and their children from Parents mediate and
immediate.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE> <HI>He sayes.</HI> If that promise doth give this power to prede∣cessours,
&amp;c. then though there are none to educate this childe, (For
the ignorant profane parents will not but teach them how to break
the covenant; The predecessours cannot, they are dead, and are
not;) yet we must seale to this childe, &amp;c. Where do you see
Churches take care of such children? they must be of some bignesse,
and understanding before the Church meddle with them; the imme∣diate
profane person brings him up in ignorance and profanenesse,
neither will take care to have his childe instructed by the Church,
as experience witnesseth too much? Answ. <HI>I understand here
the covenant-promise, as</HI> Acts 2. 39. <HI>by vertue of which
these Jewes were children of the covenant</HI> Acts 2. 35. <HI>and
not with limit to the second Commandment; and then speak
to it.</HI></P>
<P>1. Here is enough spoke to conclude the childes interest, in
case he shall be taught to break covenant, then he is in cove∣nant.
An <HI>Indians</HI> childe breaks no covenant with God; And
being in covenant, he is interessed in the priviledge of the co∣venant.</P>
<P>2. Let him make it up into formal Argument, and then it
runnes thus. That childe whose immediate Parents will not
bring it up in the power of godlinesse, hath no right to Baptism.
This, though it carry some fair shew, with those that are not able
to judge; yet it is evidently false, Those that were <HI>witnesse to
themselves, that they were the children of those that killed the Prophets,
were of the circumcision,</HI> Matth. 23. 31. yea, those that had cru∣cified
<PB N="466" REF="241"/>
Christ, were in covenant with God, and their children in
confederation, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 39. That counsel of the Prophet, <HI>Zach.
1. 4. Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former Prophets have
cryed, saying, Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Turne ye now from your
evil wayes, and your evil doings, &amp;c.</HI> might have been spared,
in case none had been received as Members in covenant; but
those whose fathers took all care for their education in the power
of godlinesse, and <HI>Stephen</HI> might have spared his reproof, <HI>Acts</HI>
7. 51, 52, 53. or rather had runne upon a contradiction when he
said, <HI>Ye stiffe-necked, and uncircumcised in hearts and eares, ye do
alwayes resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of
the Prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slaine
them which shewed before of the coming of the just One, of whom ye
have been now the betrayers and murderers; who have received the
Law by the disposition of Angels, and have not kept it.</HI> They stood
vested with their children in that great prerogative, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 1.
The case of such children is sad, but not desperate: Though the
Church cannot do the whole duty incumbent on a godly Parent,
yet it takes care for the dispensation of those Ordinances that
are saving, and Scripture calls by the name of Salvation. I know
some seeing the truth of title in such children to the covenant,
and consequently to Baptisme, and therefore dare not deny them;
yet are so farre scandalized with this loose education of children,
that they will admit it onely with this caution, that some under∣take
for their education; and so those of loose life, may have
their children baptized; <HI>because</HI> (say they) <HI>some difference ought
to be put in all divine Ordinances, between the pure and impure for the
comfort of the godly, the censure of the wicked, and the edification of
all.</HI> But I wonder how this difference of pure and impure is
seen between childe and childe, that is tendered to Baptism.
As to covenant-holinesse they are both equal, otherwise these
mens undertaking would very hardly give them admission; and
as to real-holinesse, neither have it, by communication from
their Parents; <HI>otherwise</HI> (say they) <HI>the Ordinances of God cannot be
kept without blot and pollution.</HI> I wonder what pollution these
mean; I know none in children but Original sin, and the childe
of the best Parents is tainted with it; and let us take heed of bu∣sying
our selves with more care for preservation of Ordinances,
than ever God himself took about them. If these, thus borne,
<PB N="467" REF="241"/>
have no right at all, (I suppose) they should not be admitted with
any caution whatsoever. Master <HI>Cawdry</HI> observes (and seemes
to be of that judgement,) that some think this proviso to be too
hard: I confesse, I am of that minde; If (notwithstanding so
sad discomforts in such Parents) infants stand vested in any such
Birth-right-priviledge; why should it be suspended on the courte∣sie
of such undertakers? being by birth-interest Christians, they
must not on this account passe for Heathens. And how hard is it
to impose such a burden upon any that is not ready to adopt the
issue as his owne? and in such case, his undertaking upon that
ground brings the charge of a father upon him. This will soone
grow into the bare formality of former Susceptors, God-fathers,
and God-mothers, without any real advantage to the childe.
If by education be meant, such as a godly Parent ought to give,
none will be found to do it. If onely education in the way of a
Christian, as in opposition to Judaisme, Heathenisme, it needs
not to be doubted, and that implies a covenant. What farther is
desired, must be lest to the blessing of God, by providence on Or∣dinances.
The want of piety in the Parent is supplied by
the piety of the Church, into which the infant is re∣ceived.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE> <HI>saith he.</HI> If the Predecessour may by this promise give
right to Baptisme, without the immediate Parent; then I pray you
tell us how farre we may go for this Predecessour? how many genera∣tions?
Where hath Gods Word limited Ministers, you may go to
this Predecessour, and no farther? 1. <HI>I know few that say the Prede∣cessour
gives right, without the immediate Parent, but all con∣curre
in a joynt way to communicate a covenant-interest; but
his question may have an easie answer.</HI></P>
<P>2. I demand in titles of Honour, and inheritance of Lands,
which men claime by descent from their Ancestors, where it is
that they stay? It will be soon answered that they stay, when
they can rise no higher, to finde any other Predecessours vested
in such honours, or such inheritance. Some can make no claim
at all from Parents, they are the first of their house, of honour
or inheritance. This was the case of <HI>Abraham,</HI> he had no in∣terest
from <HI>Terah;</HI> such was the case of the Primitive Converts,
and such is the case of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that now by a gracious pro∣vidence
are converted by the <HI>English.</HI> Some can go no farther
<PB N="468" REF="242"/>
then their immediate Parents; they were the first in honour, or
that gained an inheritance to their house. This was the case of
<HI>Isaac,</HI> and of those children called by the Apostle, holy, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>
7. 14. and will be the case of the children of the <HI>Indian</HI> Con∣verts,
Others can rise to the third or fourth generation; others
can go as high as the Conquest; some can claime beyond
the Conquest, by deeds beyond date: so it is with some
Christians, all may go as high as Ancestours have been in
Christianity.</P>
<P><HI>Eightly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE> If by vertue of that promise Predecessours may
without the immediate parent give right to Baptisme, then
the children of an immediate parent apostatized from the
Faith, and excommunicated from the Church, may be
baptized.</P>
<P>I have spoke already to the children of Apostates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The interest of infants of ex∣communicate persons in Ba∣ptisme.</NOTE> and as to
the children of excommunicate persons, I readily yield his con∣clusion,
that I may baptize them, against which, he thus farther
reasons.</P>
<P>If I may baptize the children of an excommunicate parent, then I
may baptize the children of one who is no Member of a Church, (for so
is the excommunicate person); so consequently the children of a Turk
or Indian, for they are no members of a Church, and the excommuni∣cated
person is no other, in respect of his communion in Church-privi∣ledges.</P>
<P>I answer, if excommunication be onely out of a particular vi∣sible
congregation (as some say,) then the reply is easie, being
thus excommunicate his right, in the Church universal visible,
still remaines, and into this, it is that we admit Members by
Baptisme, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 13. otherwise a Christian were a Chri∣stian
respective onely to one congregation, and that
congregation falling, his Christianity must fall with it; and be∣ing
taken into a new one, he must be also admitted-anew by
Baptisme.</P>
<P>But I farther answer. A Church-Member may be considered,
either <HI>quoad jus ad rem,</HI> or <HI>quoad jus in re;</HI> either respective to a
fundamental proper right, or a present personal actual fruition
of his interest. An excommunicate man in the former sense is a
Church-Member, not in the later; This excommunication is a se∣questration,
not a confiscation. He himself is suspended from
<PB N="469" REF="242"/>
present benefit, not cut off from all title, as several wayes may
be made to appear.</P>
<P>1. The Text saith, <HI>Let him be as an Heathen or a Publican</HI> (in
respect of society with him or familiarity, saith Master <HI>Cawdrey,
Diatribe pag.</HI> 218.) not an Heathen and Publicane. That Text,
2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 14. is ordinarily understood of Excommunication; yet
there the caution is added, <HI>Count him not as an enemy, but admonish
him as a brother,</HI> vers. 15. A brother is a Church-member, an ex∣communicate
person is a brother. That which is for cure, not
only of the body, but of the member in particular, is not a total
dismembring: But this sentence is for cure of the particular mem∣ber,
<HI>For the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in
the day of the Lord,</HI> 1 Cor. 5. 5.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Haec enim excommunicatio nou est iustar veneni, quod hosti datur ad exitium, sed medicina, quae fratri datur ad salutem.</NOTE> <HI>Excommunication is not like
poyson that is given to an enemy for death, but a medicine that is
given to a brother for life,</HI> saith <HI>Gomarus</HI> in 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 15. Cer∣tainly
Gods casting out of his Kingdome, <HI>Matth.</HI> 8. 12. taking
away his Kingdome, <HI>Mat.</HI> 21. 3. removal of his Candlestick,
<HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 5. the breaking off from the Olive, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 17. is a
sentence farre above Excommunication. To let passe Authours
of this minde, <HI>Zanchy,</HI> and <HI>Perkins,</HI> quoted by Master <HI>Firmin.</HI>
The National Synod of <HI>France,</HI> 1583. The Divines of <HI>Geneva,
Calvine,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ames. Danaeus, Brochman,</HI> quoted by Master <HI>Cawdrey,
Diatribe, page</HI> 216. and examine it by reason. Either the ex∣communicate
persons sin divests the childe, or else the Churches
censure; But neither the sin, nor the censure: <HI>Ergo.</HI> 1. Not the
sin as may appear, 1. By an Argument, <HI>ad hominem.</HI> Our <HI>Dis∣senting
Brethren</HI> (as we heard) allow the Baptisme, notwithstand∣ing
sin before the sentence of Excommunication; It is not then
the sin in their judgement that doth divest them. 2. By an Ar∣gument
<HI>ad rem.</HI> No sin but that of nature descends to posterity;
man transmits not his personal vices, neither fault nor guilt, no
more than his graces. And for the sentence that cannot reach
the childe, I never read that Church-censures were like that
plague laid upon <HI>Gehazi,</HI> to cleave to him and to his seed. In any
legal proceeding, the childe is not to be punished for the fathers
fault; there was a Law against it, <HI>Deut. 24. 16. The fathers shall
not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to
death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin;</HI>
and <HI>Amaziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI> is commended for observation of it,
<PB N="470" REF="243"/>
and (in his acts of justice) proceeding according to it, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI>
25. 34. and we read not that any Ecclesiastical censure should
transcend it. The child of a thief is not committed with him to pri∣son,
&amp; I see no reason that he should be committed with him to Sa∣tan:
I say then there is right to Baptism in the child of an excom∣municate
person▪ I wish our Brethren would stick here, &amp; not re∣fuse
those children, whose parents are under no Excommunication.</P>
<P><HI>As to the third, our Authour; 1. Premises a question,</HI> Whe∣ther
is this bare profession of Faith in Christ, (though Parents be
grossely ignorant, scandalous, and refuse to subject to Church-dis∣cipline)
sufficient to make a man, and continue him a Member of the
Church visible. <HI>And then proceeds to arguments, as to his que∣stion;
I wonder how he can imagine that it makes any thing
to his question; and in case it were wholly yielded him, whether
thence he could draw his conclusion, that Ministers in</HI> England
<HI>should not baptize the infants of all that professe the Faith in
Christ Jesus. He confesseth in this question he hath disadvantage.</HI>
For if a man be looked upon (<HI>saith he</HI>) as a visible Saint, and re∣puted
a Member of a true Church; if that Member be very scanda∣lous,
and the Church let him alone and not deale with him, that per∣son
may challenge any Ordinance in the Church, both Baptisme and
Lords Supper. But I conceive such a person is not sufficiently quali∣fied
to make a Member of a Church, nor ought to be continued a
Member of the Church; but the Church ought to seek to reforme
him, or if not to cast him out: so that if the Church will let such a
person alone, and give him these Ordinances, there will be guilt char∣ged
upon that Church.</P>
<P>Here, is his acknowledgement that they are continued Church-Members,
though they should not be continued, and see what
he hath further; <HI>It is true, the wicked Jewes being members of
that National Church, so long as their Membership held; they might
challenge circumcision, so for wicked persons so long as they conti∣nue
members, and the Church lets them alone, they may challenge
Baptism,</HI> and so upon his own grounds, they may of right chal∣lenge
it, and Ministers then must needes do wrong in case they
deny it, and so in all mens judgements, the question is concluded
in the Affirmative; yea, should the Church passe to the highest
of her censures, through all that is allowed to the highest top,
yet still the person under censure continues in a fundamental
<PB N="471" REF="243"/>
right of Membership, though debarred of present fruition, and
so their infants entituled, as we have seen, to Baptisme. His
Arguments are worthy of examination, in which he concludes
such a one is not fit to be a Member.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments to carry the que∣stion in the ne∣gative answer.</NOTE> Members of Churches according to the Gospel are Saints
visible: But such a person as the question mentions, is not a visible
Saint: Ergo. <HI>The Minor he proves,</HI> Such as will say that such a
person as the Question mentions is a visible Saint, I thinke his eyes
are not good. He that tells me, the Saints which <HI>Paul</HI> mentions in
those places were no other than such a person as is in the Question, he
must pardon me, though I beleeve him not.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Visible Saint, is taken, either in regard of Separation for,
and dedication to God, or for real qualifications according to
the power of godlinesse, in the first sense, such are real Saints,
that he mentions and rejects, in which sense we have shewn
[Saint] to be frequently taken, and such were most of the Mem∣bers
of the Church of <HI>Sardis,</HI> there being few that had not de∣filed
their garments, and many such in the Church of <HI>Corinth:</HI>
In the second sense (and I know not a third) his eyes are bet∣ter
than mine, that can determine concerning them. Inward
graces onely make a real Saint, and these to me are invisible:
if he meanes so far as mens judgements can upon any fair ground
conclude that they are such, then the Apostles will be involved
in our guilt, who hand over head admitted members the same
day they were converted, being in foul sins, and never staying
time to make judgement of the hopeful truth of their graces.
<HI>Paul</HI> calls all those that he persecuted, Saints, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.
10. So doth <HI>Ananias, Acts</HI> 9. 13. all those for whom af∣ter
conversion he ordered and made Collections 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16. 1.
And these were some of them as bad as any that in his Epistles he
reproves.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If a bare profession in Christ be sufficient to make a
member of a Church, then no person can justly be excommunicated
out of a Church for the vilest sins or heresies, provided he doth but
hold this profession of his faith, the consequence is cleare, the person
is the same which he was when you took him into the Church. <HI>The
consequence is clearely erroneous: for he made a pro∣fession
of his faith, and not of sin, as we see in</HI> Simon Magus.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>He that manifestly opposeth Christ in his visible King∣dome,
<PB N="472" REF="244"/>
is not fit to be a member of a Church. But such a person as the
question mentions doth manifestly oppose Christ in his visible king∣dome.
Ergo,</HI> Not fit to passe without censure, should have been
added: but whiles he acts rebellion, he professeth subjection and
in the Apostles language is a professor, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 2. Having thus
made way he propounds several Arguments, that Ministers
by the Gospel are not to baptize the children of such Pa∣rents.</P>
<P>We come now to our Authours arguments; First, <HI>Such per∣sons
as</HI> de jure <HI>ought, and</HI> de facto <HI>are excluded by godly Ministers
from the Lords Supper, ought also to be excluded from their childrens
Baptisme; But such persons as the Question mentions</HI> de jure <HI>ought,
and</HI> de facto <HI>are excluded from the Lords Supper:</HI> Ergo. The Major
is proved, <HI>If Baptisme doth seale to the same covenant which the Lords
Supper doth, and doth signifie and seale as great blessings and privi∣ledges
as the Lords Supper doth, then those who are excluded from
the Lords Supper, ought also to be excluded from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r childrens Bap∣tisme:
But the Antecedent is true:</HI> Ergo. <HI>The Consequent.</HI> This
is Master <HI>Blackwoods</HI> argument to keep infants from Baptisme, be∣cause
they are kept from the Supper: And if it be of any validity
to serve our Authors turn, it is of as great force for Master <HI>Black∣wood;</HI>
Give me leave in Master <HI>Blackwoods</HI> behalfe to urge it in
this manner, with the least change of words that is possible:
If Baptisme doth seal to the same covenant which the Lords Sup∣per
doth, and doth signifie and seale as great blessings and
priviledges as the Lords Supper doth: then those that are ex∣cluded
from the Lords Supper ought also to be excluded from
Baptisme; But all infants are excluded from the Lords Supper
<HI>eo nomine,</HI> because they are infants; and therefore they are to
be excluded from Baptisme. When Master <HI>Firmin</HI> hath given
a faire and full answer to this Syllogisme, he may easily fit it to
his own, to give like satisfaction. An infant in covenant may
be admitted by that signe and scale, in the use of which he is
meerely passive, and yet be kept back on the account of his in∣fancy,
from that sign and seale, which the Participants must actu∣ally
improve for their spiritual benefit, and consequently a
Parent may put a present bar to his actual admission (by reason of
present guilt) to the one, when his innocent infant can put no
barre to his admission to the other. The Parent stands <HI>de jure</HI>
<PB N="473" REF="244"/>
entituled, when for the present he may be for his spiritual bene∣fit
<HI>de facto</HI> suspended. Another reverend Authour hath made
use of this argument from the uniformity of the service of
God in general, and in particular from the uniformity in the
Sacraments to another purpose; not to exclude any infants at
all who descend from Christian Parents, from Baptisme, but for
admission of all visible Church-Members, not under the sentence
of Excommunication, to the Lords Supper. As one from the sus∣pension
of Parents from the Lords Supper would conclude the
suspension of infants from Baptism; So, the other from the ad∣mission
of all infants without difference to Baptism, would in∣fer,
not onely a just warranty, but also a necessity of answerable
admittance of their Parents to the Lords Supper: <Q>Let our Inde∣pendents
(<HI>saith he</HI>) answer, Why do you allow a <HI>Syntax</HI> in
the service of God besides, and bring in a <HI>Quae genus</HI> of <HI>Ano∣males</HI>
and <HI>Heteroclites</HI> onely at this Ordinance? let some of our
Presbyterians answer how can we admit of children as mem∣bers
of the visible Church being borne of Christian parents unto
Baptisme, and yet turne away the parents of those children
from the Sacrament? Those that have gone about to answer
this, had better haply have said nothing: for our free course
of Baptisme, and a denial of this is such a seam-rent, as will
never be handsomely drawn up, though stitcht together; ne∣verthelesse
in yielding the one, they have granted the other;</Q>
As to this passage, I first marvel how this is laid to the charge of
Independents, that they allow a <HI>Syntax</HI> in the whole service of
God besides, and bring in <HI>Anomalaes</HI> and <HI>Heteroclites,</HI> onely at
this Ordinance; namely, the Lords Supper; when it is plain that
they have as many <HI>Heteroclites</HI> in Baptisme as the Lords Supper.
And in both the Sacraments (as to those that they judge admit∣tible)
they keep the form as whole as himself contends it ought
to be kept, how many rents soever they may make besides. The
same latitude that they hold in admission of parents to the Sup∣per,
they hold in admission of children to Baptisme. And for
Presbyterians, their admission of infants to the one, will by no
meanes conclude them under any necessity of admission of the
parents to the other Sacrament; Nor on the contrary will their
suspension of parents, conclude any necessity of like suspension of
infants; Every tub must stand on its own bottome, every one
<PB N="474" REF="245"/>
must beare his own burden; when parents divolve a covenant-ti∣tle,
they do not divolve a covenant-breach upon their children.
And I desire to know how he will keep up any such uniformity
that he contends for, according to that which I conceive to be
his own opinion. Persons under Excommunication are confes∣sed
to be uncapable of the Lords Supper; I desire to learne whe∣ther
that sentence, cut off from the Church root and branch?
Whether it be a sentence personal or hereditary? I much mistake
my Authour, in case he will maintaine the latter, that that sword
is held out with so keen an edge, to lop off both parent and child;
If he admit the former, than the same rent is made, of which he
so much complaines. Presbyterians that keep those persons from
the Sacrament as a degree of punishment in order to that
sentence of Excommunication (as they use to speake) whom
they judge to be in a way deserving it, and admit their in∣fants
to Baptisme, make no other manner of rent in the
worship of God, than those that keep back persons under
actual excommunication, and give the like admission to in∣fants.
The state of Parent and childe respective to the co∣venant
is homogeneal. If the root be holy, the branch is
holy, and so <HI>è contra,</HI> yet the parent by his misdemeanour
may incur that censure of which his infant is not deserving.
His argument should run thus, If the guilty parent be de∣barred
of a priviledge, then the innocent childe ought to
be debarred likewise: me thinks a difference might be put
between a scandalous parent that is active, and an innocent
childe that is passive; a parent that cannot, will not im∣prove
it to his comfort, but to his judgement, and a child
that cannot mis-improve it; <HI>My Argument</HI> (saith he) <HI>runs
upon the first supposition, that the childe brings nothing with
it, considered as abstracted from the parent, but it is the pa∣rent
gives the right.</HI> And the parent conferres right in co∣venant,
Though he breakes covenant, yet conferres not
the transgression of it; the Argument were as good that the
childe must necessarily be admitted to the Lords Table, be∣cause
the father did worthily receive it. If it be said, the father
is worthy, so is not the childe; so we say, the father is unworthy of
the one, <HI>i.e.</HI> tenders himself unworthy, and so doth not the child
of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="475" REF="245"/>
The second Argument. <Q>Such parents as if they themselves
were now to be baptized, ought not to be baptized, cannot
justly challenge Baptisme for their children, neither are we
bound to administer it. But such parents as the Question men∣tions,
if they now were to be baptized, ought not to be bap∣tized.</Q>
<HI>Ergo.</HI> This argument is of the same stamp with the for∣mer,
and needs no other answer, The parent hath contracted a
great load of guilt, of which the infant is innocent; This argu∣ment
well followed home might unbaptize a great part of
those that are of this judgement, and render all their priviledges
in Church-Ordinances fruitlesse, for want of a previous
Baptisme.</P>
<P>The third argument. <Q>If Ministers in baptizing are bound to hold
to their Commission, then the children of such parents as the que∣stion
mentions, are not to be baptized. But the Antecedent is true,
none will deny that; <HI>Ergo.</HI> The consequence is true. Ministers by
their Commission, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. 19 (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
are bound to baptize Disciples, but these are no Disciples, <HI>Ergo.</HI>
My argument tends to this, If the parent be not a Disciple, the
childe is none: But such a parent is none, <HI>Ergo.</HI> his childe is
none.</Q> Here he sayes, <HI>the Anabaptists triumph,</HI> and well they
may, if there be any strength in this argument. <HI>But</HI> (saith he)
<HI>we can easily distinguish;</HI> and I say we can distinguish as easily.
Distinctions sufficient may be seen, <HI>chap.</HI> 38. where it is suffici∣ently
made good that these in question are Disciples, Disciples as
to the participation of Ordinances; Even a truantly untoward
boy is of the number of Scholars, and, as he well deserves the lash,
so he hath the priviledges of the School.</P>
<P>The fourth argument. <Q>To administer the Seale of the co∣venant
of grace to a child by vertue of him who is visibly in
covenant with Satan, must needes be a prophaning of the
Ordinance. But to administer Baptisme to a childe by ver∣tue
of such a one as the question mentions, is to admini∣ster
the Seal of the covenant of grace to a child by vertue of
one who is visibly in covenant with Satan. <HI>Ergo. The
minor is thus by him proved.</HI> A person grossely ignorant in
the fundamentals of Religion, his course of life, his trade
is to live in sinne, scandalous, &amp;c.</Q> What shall we say of such
a one, though he doth not formally make a covenant with the
Devil, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="246"/>
To be visibly in covenant, and formally enter no covenant, is
little lesse than a contradiction: put the argument into form. To
administer the Seale of the covenant of Grace to a childe, by
vertue of him that is formally in covenant with God, and real∣ly
does service to Satan, must needs be a prophaning of the Ordi∣nance;
and then the weaknesse of his argument will appeare vi∣sible,
and no visibility of a covenant with Satan found. I do not
know a man or woman in the world, whose childe I could refuse
on this account. Those to whom our Saviour speaks in the sharp∣est
language, <HI>Joh. 8. 44. You are of your father the Devil, and the
lusts of your father ye will do,</HI> were men in covenant with God,
and had their children initiated with the signe and seal of the
covenant, he farther saith, <HI>I wonder how Ministers pray, when
they baptize the childe of such a one, they cannot but have some
eye to Gods covenant, and do we not mention so much to the
Lord, that he having taken the parent into covenant with him∣selfe,
he doth also the seed of the parent, and so we plead the
covenant, and a blessing, &amp;c. but when a godly Minister shall
carry the parent in his heart thus, doth not his heart check him,
trouble him, in the thought of the parent?</HI> They may well pray
that God will make his Ordinances (through his Spirit) of pow∣er,
that the infant of a covenant-breaking father, may be a cove∣nant-keeping
childe, that such an <HI>Abaz</HI> in covenant, and break∣ing
covenant, may have an <HI>Hezekiah</HI> keeping covenant; such an
<HI>Ammon,</HI> a <HI>Josiah,</HI> and this without the least check of conscience.
This is frequently heard of God, and prayers for the children of
godly parents frequently denied: <HI>David</HI> hath an <HI>Ammon</HI> and
<HI>Absalom, Jehoshaphat</HI> a <HI>Jehoram</HI> and <HI>Josiah</HI> a <HI>Jehoaz;</HI> Their
conscience would infinitely more check them, (if the word
regulate their consciences) when providence conferres
priviledges of Ordinances on such an infant to be re∣ceived
where salvation is, upon so weak, and as to Scri∣pture
unheard of plea, as his fathers transgression to keep it
out.</P>
<P>For a fifth Argument. He hints two things which he would
have seriously taken into examination, though he sayes he
will not put them into form. 1. <Q>How exceedingly this Ordi∣nance
is sleighted, abused through this heedlesse administring
of the Ordinance; for we see persons never minde the Ordi∣nance
<PB N="477" REF="246"/>
beforehand, nor after: But come let us have our chil∣dren
baptized, and that is all; if they can make a feast, and
drink after it, that is well.</Q> This is the argument of <HI>Anabaptists</HI>
against infant-Baptisme; Because some Reverend Divines com∣plaine
that few improve their Baptisme received in infancy, to
any spiritual advantage to their souls, therefore it is in vaine to
Baptize infants. One is like the other, in Ordinances of God,
to reason from the abuse, to the casting of them aside. Non∣singers
of Psalmes (which himselfe professes to oppose) may
reason in this sort, and upon like ground some have warned men
out of Christ not to pray, they ought to forbeare till they are in
Christ. And when a natural man blesses God for a good crop,
that it were as good that he cursed him. If men were disposed
to wrangle, here doubtlesse were more colour against such mens
performances of duties, in which onely themselves are interessed,
than against parents tender of their infants to an Ordinance, in
which of right they are entitled, though they lay not to heart a
right and pious way of performance of it. <Q>Besides, (<HI>saith he</HI>)
it is strange to see how we jumble the most holy and prophane
men together; If Master <HI>Greenham,</HI> Master <HI>Perkins,</HI> Master
<HI>Rogers,</HI> Master <HI>Dod,</HI> or whom you will, should come and
bring their children to be baptized, let the most ignorant sot,
drunkard, swearer, uncleane person, scorner of godlinesse,
&amp;c. come, he shall have his childe baptized as well as they.
Have they their children taken into covenant? so have I sayes
the drunkard, swearer, &amp;c. shall we owne all these men alike
under the covenant so as to give the seale of the covenant a like
to all?</Q> This many a time hath been in my thoughts, and in no∣thing
did I ever receive more full satisfaction, Not one of these
holy men, would have made any such complaint, and in case
the children of such should meet in this Ordinance, I could as ea∣sily
difference them by their visage and features, as I could re∣spective
to their several interests or priviledges. Parents are in co∣venant
with God, as long as they keep up the name and professi∣on
of Christians; the one with all care walks up to the termes
of the covenant, and the other are as loose and carelesse in it:
Master <HI>Greenham,</HI> Master <HI>Perkins</HI> could not transmit to their
children their graces; Neither do these transmit their personal
wickednesse: Look into the Common-wealth of <HI>Rome,</HI> and call
<PB N="478" REF="247"/>
out the most deserving Patriots, set against them <HI>Verres, Cati∣line,</HI>
or who you will, freedome of birth, interest in native pri∣viledges
is like to the issue of either, and so it is in the Church of
God, the Common-weale of <HI>Israel:</HI> and it can be no other∣wise;
if there be any priviledge divolved from parent
to childe; And when this falls, infant-Baptisme falls
together with it; nothing in the childe (as our Au∣thour
well observes) without relation to the parent can give
any interest.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The application of the whole in several inferences.</HEAD>
<P>TO winde up the whole of this discourse of the birth-privi∣ledge
of the seed of Beleevers in some practical appli∣cation.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. All possible engagements and obligati∣ons to holi∣nesse.</NOTE> All possible engagements and obligations unto all holi∣nesse
of conversation necessarily follows and flowes from this
royal priviledge, and high advancement of birth-holinesse; If we
contend for their dignity, and minde them not at all of duty, of
the honour of their birth, and call them not to a suitable life; In
the neglect of duty they may soon make forfeiture of their dig∣nity,
and turn this singular mercy into the highest aggravation of
their misery: we blame those of noble and generous birth, that
betake themselves to sordid and ignoble wayes, Thus degenera∣ting
they are a blot to their families, a disgrace and reproach to
their race; no birth equal in honour to that of Christians. <HI>Theodo∣sius</HI>
worthily esteemed it a greater honour that he was a Christian,
than that he was an Emperour: None degenerate so foully and
blame-worthily, as they when their conversation is unchristian,
wayes of sin are for sinners of the Gentiles, a way proper for Turks
and Pagans, let the holy seed be holy, their demeanour suited to
their honour. <HI>Sardanapalus</HI> the King may with lesse infamy spin a∣mong
women, or <HI>Domitian</HI> the Emperour spend his time in catch∣ing
of flies, works farre below their dignities, than a Christian
may sin with a Heathen. The Martyrs in Primitive times being
moved to swear by the fortune of <HI>Caesar,</HI> thought that the answer
<PB N="479" REF="247"/>
was full, and fair, to say they were Christians: Such answer should
he have that would tempt to ungodlinesse, <HI>should such a one as I
fly?</HI> saith <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> Nehem. 6. 11. his honour would not suffer
him to be so base; should such a man as a Christian (the least of
whom is greater than <HI>Nehemiahs</HI> better, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11, 11.) be for sin?
He that is not a sinner by birth, should be no sinner in his life. Ba∣ptisme
is the greatest honour, such bear Christs name, and weare
his livery; they have that title in which <HI>Jude</HI> and <HI>James</HI> with o∣ther
of the Apostles gloried, <HI>A servant of Jesus Christ.</HI> Baptisme
is the greatest engagement, <HI>Let every one that nameth Christ de∣part
from iniquity,</HI> 2 Tim. 2. 19. To talk of Baptisme, and to live
in sin, is to wear the colours of one, and plot and fight for ano∣ther;
to wear Christs colours, and fight for Satan. Baptisme ren∣ders
a sinner up to the heaviest punishment. The high favours
shewed to the Jewes, made a Jew to fare worse in the wayes of
sin than an Heathen, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 2. The high favours shewed to Chri∣stians
make Christians to fare worse in sinful wayes than Heathens,
<HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 3. All in a Christians calling bespeaks this holinesse. God
by whom he is called, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 15. The work to which he is called,
1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4. 7. The company unto which he is joyned, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 19.

<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parents must see that their childrens bree∣ding do answer their birth.</NOTE> Let the parents of such seed, now see what educa∣tion

6. 4. God may call on them thus to bring up his children, in na∣ture

soloecisme is it, that Parents should dedicate children, so soon as
borne unto Christ, professing to the world that they belong to
him; and that with <HI>Hannah</HI> concerning <HI>Samuel,</HI> they intend
them for him, when nothing appeares in their education, but
that they might have been given to <HI>Molok,</HI> somewhat worse
than the mongrell seed that spoke halfe in the language of <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI>
and halfe in the language of <HI>Ashdod, Nehem.</HI> 13. 24. Scarce
<PB N="480" REF="248"/>
a word can be heard out of their mouths, to argue that
they are Christians, lisping out oaths as soone as words; put
to learne trades, and little regard had that they might know
Christ Jesus. And how much is it to be desired, that au∣thority
would take order, for more careful catechistical
teaching of youth in the wayes of Christian Religion, that
God may not complaine of <HI>England,</HI> as of <HI>Israel, My people

also they may be trained; That as God honours our children
with his name, calling them his children, so they may honour
his name, and advance his glory in all holinesse of conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The danger of persecution.</NOTE> Those may yet see whom they oppose, that
stand in opposition of a people thus interessed, a people so
ingratiated to God in covenant, that there is not the least
infant in whom God hath not his title, and right of chal∣lenge.
The aggravation of the <HI>Psalmists</HI> complaint is, that
<HI>the Heathens are come into thine inheritance, the dead bodies
of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the foules of the
heaven, the flesh of thy. Saints unto the beasts of the Earth,
Psalme</HI> 79. 1, 2, 3. The whole body of such a people, root
and branch, stand in relation to God as the inheritance, the
servants, the Saints of God; such inscriptions we finde in
Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles, not one of the whole body is exclu∣ded,
but they are such by covenant, and such by calling.
Enough hath been said to make it to appeare that the de∣nomination
reaches even infants who are the Lords heritage,
<HI>Psalme</HI> 127. 3. and Christs name is upon them, <HI>Matth.</HI> 18.
5. As it is accounted an happy work to dash the little ones
of <HI>Babylon</HI> against the wall, <HI>Psalme</HI> 137. 9. because of the
hostility of that Nation against God and his people: so it
<PB N="481" REF="248"/>
is a like execration to intermeddle with the little ones of
<HI>Sion,</HI> by reason of the holinesse of such a people, their co∣venant-relations
in which they stand interessed, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 8.
12. Much is spoken in Scripture against the enemies of the
righteous, the haters of them shall be desolate, he that of∣fends
against them shall not be innocent, <HI>Psalme</HI> 34. 21.
God observes every carriage of the adversary towards them
in misery, they speak not a word but God hath it against
them; when Ammonites, Tyrians, cry Aha, against the
people of God, they are witted with it, and threatned for
it, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 26. 2. 36. 2. Not a proud word that they utter
but it is brought in, to fill up the charge against them,
<HI>Obad. 12. Psalme</HI> 137. 7. yea, every eye that is cast with ap∣probation
of the adversary, <HI>Obad.</HI> 13. 14. Every encoura∣ging
word they speak, and every act they do against such
a people, yea injuries of elder times are kept in the deck,
and laid to them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 25. 17. And all because they stand
in this relation to God as his in covenant, which you cannot
limit onely to the personally righteous, but all that are
of a Society and fellowship, that is, such as are interessed
in a righteous cause. The holy anointing oile did make sa∣cred
when yet too often the man was wicked, and therefore
<HI>David</HI> looked upon <HI>Saul</HI> as the Lords Anointed. It holds
in Analogy and proportion unto all that have any unction
from God, as all the called of God have. When they
were but a few in number, yea very few, and strangers;
when they <HI>went from one Nation to another, from one King∣dome
to another people, he suffered no man to do them wrong,
yea he reproved Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine
Anointed, Psalme</HI> 105. 12, 13, 14, 15. All the people of
God have that Anointing from God, that none may dare
to intermeddle for their harme. God promises his people
that dwell in <HI>Sion,</HI> that the burthen of <HI>Assyria</HI> shall be ta∣ken
from off their shoulder, and his yoke from off their
neck, and that the yoke shall be destroyed, because of the
Anointing, <HI>Isaiah</HI> 10. 27. Some will say, as this is carried,
The danger of intermeddling with any is with us a like:
Even Papists and the worst of men that are called Prote∣stants,
are thus of a people that are called Gods people,
<PB N="482" REF="249"/>
and go by the name of Christians. For answer I shall not
enter upon that controversie, what there is of the being of
a Church under the Papacy. The Papacy it self is none of
it, but onely a botch bred in it, and cleaving to it; onely
this I say, That he that shall oppose a Papist, under the no∣tion
of a Christian, shall bear his sinne, and that upon the
grounds that have been given. Though a Papists damnable
errors in the faith shut him out from the happinesse of Chri∣stians,
yet such an adversaries persecution renders him guilty
of opposing the faith of Christ Jesus. And he that follows
with injuries a carnal Protestant, because of profession of the
sincerity of Religion, in opposition to Antichristianisme,
is formally guilty of persecution. The hearers resembled
to the rocky ground suffer persecution for the Word, as doth
the good ground that brings forth fruit with patience, <HI>Mat.</HI>
13. 21. But to come home with more cleare satisfaction.
A people of foully polluted Ordinance, standing in oppo∣sition
to a people of a pure and untainted way, are as a
people void of Ordinances, are as a people without God in
comparison. The opposition of the purity of his service,
God accounts as the opposition of his great name, though
it be by a people that go under that name of his people.
And therefore though <HI>Elijah</HI> take so much to heart the pul∣ling
down of Altars set up by <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> looking upon them
as Gods Altars, when it was done by <HI>Israel</HI> apostatizing and
turned to <HI>Baal, 1 Kings</HI> 19. 10. and in opposition to the
worship of <HI>Baal,</HI> makes that way of worship at <HI>Dan</HI> and
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>achel</HI> a following of God; yet we know how the Prophet
from the mouth of God did cry out against that Altar, which
<HI>Jeroboam</HI> erected, and foretold the destruction of it, and
the slaughter of the Priests that offered upon it, 1 <HI>Kings</HI>
13. 2. and with what honour that act of <HI>Josiah</HI> is men∣tioned
in accomplishment of this prophecy, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 23. 15.
and the brand that lies upon <HI>Jeroboam</HI> himself in bringing
in that worship of his, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 15. 9. scarce the like on
any man in Scripture, the man of sinne onely excepted, the
high phrases also in which this worship is set out, making
Priests for the high places, and devils, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 11. 14, 15.
with the heighth of guilt to which he rose, in casting the
<PB N="483" REF="249"/>
<HI>Levites</HI> out from executing the Priests office, <HI>Hosea</HI> 4. 6.
And howsoever God often calls that people of the ten
tribes by the name of his people as having Ordinances,
though miserably polluted, yet in opposition to <HI>Judah</HI> where
more pure Ordinances were enjoyed, they are said to be
without God, without a teaching Priest, and without the
law, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15. 3. And fighting against <HI>Judah</HI> (who could
reckon up the particulars of the Ordinances of God in their
purity) they are charged to fight against the Lord God of
their fathers, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 13. 12. To come nearer home in an
instance. If the Turkish power should fall upon a Popish
State, under the name and notion of Christians, they were
guilty with <HI>Saul</HI> of persecuting the Lord Jesus. If this Po∣pish
State fall upon a reformed Nation, they are much
more guilty; A fouler sinne for a people of God in name
and title, to persecute his people in truth, than for a peo∣ple,
strangers to God, to persecute a people onely in name
and title. Scripture prayers against Heathens we may fitly
apply in our sufferings under the hands of Papists. <HI>Pilate</HI>
might have been guilty of persecution of a Pharisee, under
the notion of a Jew, and yet that Nation was much more
guilty in delivering up Christ into the hands of <HI>Pilate,</HI> though
Christ had been no greater than the meanest of his Disciples.
A Papist persecuting a formal carnal Protestant, under no∣tion
of a man protesting against Idolatrous wayes, blas∣phemes
and persecutes that faith which he holds in oppositi∣on
against those Antichristian tenents. This man being thus
persecuted, persecuting another for the power of godlinesse,
professing the same truth is equally, ye more guilty. The
very sinne of <HI>Cain</HI> against his brother <HI>Abel, 1 John</HI> 3. 12.
their Religions were both one and the same, but <HI>Cains</HI> was
onely, in forme, and <HI>Abels</HI> in power. The result of the
whole is to let us see what it is to oppose a people under
any notion of Gods people, upon any such account as
belonging to Christ. A man may have his reward, gi∣ving
to any in the name of a Disciple, though he to
whom he gives be such as God will never owne for a Dis∣ciple,
and answerably may incurre vengeance in oppo∣sition
of one under such a name, though (with those
<PB N="484" REF="250"/>
on the rocky ground) he be nothing lesse than such in deed and
truth.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consolation.</NOTE> Abundance of sweet consolations yet flow from
this birth-priviledge and covenant-holinesse, and that in several
streames.</P>
<P>1. In regard of Nations.</P>
<P>2. In regard of Persons.</P>
<P>In regard of Nations they have royal transcendency above all
others as alone worthy the name of a people:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. To Nations thus honoured.</NOTE> Nigh unto God:
A people of hope: Enjoying light; when others are darknesse,
without hope, and without God in the world. The <HI>Psalmist</HI> reck∣ons
up many and sweet-blessings of a Nation. That our sons may
be as plants grown up in their youth, that our daughters may be
as corner-stones polished after the similitude of a palace, that
our garners may be full, affording all manner of store, that our
sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands in our
streets, that our Oxen may be strong to labour, that there be
no breaking in nor going out, that there be no complaining in
our streets, <HI>Psalme</HI> 144. 12, 13, 14. All these are singular Nati∣onal
favours, but onely serving to make up a comparative, not an
absolute blessednesse. This one riseth higher and makes it
compleat, Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord. The
glory pertaines to a Nation thus honoured, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. Of such
a people (though otherwise mean and despicable, as was <HI>Israel</HI>
in the Wildernesse, comparative to other Nations) it may be
said, What Nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh un∣to
them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon
him for? <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 7. No people can so bottome their prayers
against adversaries, as they who are the people of Gods holinesse;
This mercy is a birth-mercy to al such persons whose parents with
<HI>Timothy</HI> from one to another have been Beleevers, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 5.
and while national provocations break not forth (which alone
with God have separating and deafning power) his eare is
ready to hear, and his hand to help, while he sees not iniquity
in <HI>Jacob,</HI> nor perversenesse in <HI>Israel,</HI> (which I understand of Na¦tional
out-breaches from God, which by <HI>Balaams</HI> counsel pre∣sently
followed to <HI>Israels</HI> danger) so long God is among them,
as the shout of a King, and there is no sorcery nor divination
against them, <HI>Num.</HI> 23. 21, 23. A Nation fast to God hath God

<ITEM>Posterity.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>For themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Respective to themselves.</NOTE> it is much to be able with the <HI>Psalmist</HI> to say,
Thou art he that took me out of the wombe: Thou didst make
me to hope when I was upon my mothers breasts. I was cast up∣on
thee from the wombe, thou art my God from my mothers
belly, <HI>Psal.</HI> 22. 9, 10. This puts upon confidence in prayer (as
an argument drawn from long continued acquaintance) as there
follows, Be not farre from me, for trouble is neer, <HI>Ver.</HI> 11. Such

while they suck milk from the brests. An expression of height
setting out this birth-happiness that hath sure more in it, then can
be applied to sinners of the Gentiles; see how the <HI>Psalmist</HI> yet
farther pleads it with God, O Lord, truely I am thy servant, I am
thy servant, and the son of thy hand-maid, <HI>Psal.</HI> 116. 16. an allu∣sion
to the law of servants who were the inheritance of the Master
in whose house they were, <HI>Exod. 21. 4. Levit. 25. 16. I</HI> am such,
saith the <HI>Psalmist</HI> (thy servant, thy servant) with all earnestne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of affection, I am of thine inheritance, I am one of those that are
thy house-borne-servants, my mother was thy hand-maid, I have
therefore this relation to plead; and this he pleads again and again
in the same words, <HI>Psal.</HI> 86. 16. This great priviledge <HI>Isaiah</HI> in like
manner takes notice of, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49. 1. The Lord hath called me from
the wombe, from the bowels of my mother hath he made menti∣on
of my name. The Apostle mindes the Ephesians of their for∣mer
condition, and will have them to remember the time past,
when they were without Christ, being aliens from the Common-Wealth
of <HI>Israel,</HI> and strangers from the covenants of promise,
having no hope, without God in the world: But there never was
a time in which men of this birth-priviledge were in that condi∣tion,
these are Gods heritage from the wombe, and with <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI>
(some in greater, some in lesse measure) from children have
the knowledge of the Scriptures, if not with <HI>John</HI> Baptist full
of the Holy Ghost from the wombe, <HI>Luke</HI> 1. 15. which yet
doubtlesse is the happinesse not of few, who are eminent in
sanctification, whose growth in grace is seen, and yet the begin∣nings

<HI>John</HI> 5. 3. Salvation is of the Jewes, saith our Saviour, <HI>John</HI> 4.
22. Saving Ordinances are their inheritance; They are happily
seated under that joyful sound which is able to save the soul, <HI>Jam.</HI>
1. 21. Salvation is of his house, who is the sonne of <HI>Abraham,</HI>
Luke 19. 9.</P>
<P>As it is full of consolation to Beleevers in respect of themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Respective to their posteri∣ty.</NOTE>
so also in reference to their posterity, their children are Gods
children; they being the Lords inheritance, their children are
his heritage in like manner, they bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth children to God;
and he ownes and challenges their seed as his, <HI>Ezek,</HI> 16. 20. An
infinite love in God, an unspeakable comfort to a perent, when
the Infant who by corruption of nature, is in Satans jawes, and
in no lesse danger of hell than <HI>Moses</HI> sometimes was of the wa∣ter,
and not so much as sensible of his condition, God pleases
in this sad state to look upon him, and to make it the time of
love, finding out wayes for his freedome. What the Apostle
speaks from the Prophet, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 10. of Gods care of the
Gentiles, is certainly true being applied to infants, I was found
of them that sought me not, and made manifest to them that
enquired not after me. Had we that hopelesse opinion of our
children, as Papists have of theirs that die without Baptisme, what
a wretched case were it with <HI>David</HI> to part with an infant out
of the world? How could such mourne in any other way than as
those that are without hope, parting with an infant without any
part in Christ, and in no better posture towards God than the
seed of the sinners of the Gentiles doomed both by the <HI>Psalmist</HI>
and the Prophet <HI>Jeremy,</HI> Psalm. 79. 6. <HI>Jerem.</HI> 10. 25. Pour out
thy wrath on the heathen that have not known thee, and upon
the families that call not upon thy name; they might with <HI>Rachel</HI>
weep for their children, and refuse to be comforted, because for
eternity they are not. But we finde God more rich in mercy,
entring covenant with his and their seed, Christ himselfe im∣bracing
them in their infancy, and taking them into his special
love, as those that bear his name: and though death should pre∣vent
their Baptisme, whereby they have an actual interest in vi∣sible
Church-priviledges, yet he that hath appointed Ordinan∣ces
<PB N="487" REF="251"/>
is not tied to them, but where he hath entered covenant can
save without them. <HI>Bellarmine</HI> confesseth that the desire of Ba∣ptisme
in one that is in the number of the <HI>Catechumoni</HI> (instructed
in the principles of Christ, and not baptized) doth save, though
the text <HI>John</HI> 3. 5. so much urged by that party against the sal∣vation
of infants, understood with their Comment be in the
letter against it; why then should not that grace which would
shew it selfe in like desires, when the person is of capacity, quali∣fie
for salvation in like manner? Finding this love in God, these
bowels in Christ, we may safely conclude, that children have blisse,
parents have comfort, parents and children have their interest
in Church-Ordinances and Administrations.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat I might satisfie the desire of
some worthy Freinds, I do here
present unto thee a Sermon with
very little alteration) preached
at the Funerall of that Godly and Learned
Minister of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> Mr. <HI>Blake,</HI> now with
God: Being the rather induced thereunto, be∣cause
I know the memory of his Name, will be
very gratefull and welcome to such who were
acquainted with him. How sadly his death was
laid to heart, the deportment of many at that
time did abundantly manifest, and Although
I cannot speak the same which <HI>Nazianzen</HI> af∣firmeth
concerning the Funeral solemnities of
<HI>Basil,</HI> how that many thousands were there</P>

<P>valedictory Sermon, we know not whether the
<HI>matter,</HI> or the <HI>affection</HI> in the delivering of it, be
more admirable: It's milk that cometh hot from
the breast; excellent matter, without hearty af∣fections,
is like a Messenger without feet, and a
Bird without wings. I shall not make a Sermon
upon his Sermon, onely in the general; by that
discourse we have a description of a <HI>Pastor</HI> and
<HI>Officer</HI> in the Church, <HI>in Idea</HI> and <HI>in subjecto: In
Idea,</HI> or in the <HI>Thesi,</HI> there the Apostle describeth
such by their name and titles, they are <HI>Overseers</HI>
and <HI>Elders, v.</HI> 17. from the <HI>efficient cause</HI> the Holy
Ghost hath made them so, from the <HI>relation they
are in:</HI> The People are their Flock, and they are
Gods Church. And lastly, from the <HI>dignity and
high thoughts put upon them by Christ,</HI> they were
purchased with his own blood, shall we think our
labor, our pains, our sweat, too much, when Christ
thought not his blood too much?</P>
<P>To enter upon the Controversie who these <HI>El∣ders</HI>
and <HI>Overseers</HI> were, is repugnant to the occa∣sion
at this time: Then you have this office <HI>in
subjecto, in Hypothesi;</HI> in the practice of it, you have
the rule of a <HI>Pastor,</HI> and the example of a <HI>Ruler,</HI>
and that is in <HI>Paul</HI> himself: O the <HI>zeal, watchful∣ness,</HI>
the <HI>diligence,</HI> the <HI>courage,</HI> the <HI>purity</HI> of <HI>aime</HI>
and <HI>ends,</HI> which he professeth in his Ministerial
discharge! not that he speaketh these for ostenta∣tion,
but imitation; for he would not have said
thus much of himself, saith <HI>Grotius</HI> on the place,
but that hereby he would leave a <HI>patern</HI> or <HI>form of
life</HI> to all successors; Insomuch, that no Minister
<PB N="3" REF="266"/>
reading <HI>Pauls</HI> expressions of himself in this place,
but may cry out, O me! a clod of earth to such
a Star, Ice to such a Fire, a worm to such an An∣gel!
Though he were a <HI>Paul,</HI> as some think his
name denoteth, little in stature of his body, yet
he was a Gyant in Gifts and Graces, so that Papists
themselves cannot but give the pre-eminence to
<HI>Paul</HI> above <HI>Peter,</HI> in respect of Doctrine and Mi∣nisterial
abilities: He was the <HI>earthly Angel,</HI> the
<HI>Cor Christi,</HI> the <HI>Tuba Evangelii,</HI> as the Ancients
call him; yet I am not of <HI>Amyraldus</HI> his minde,
<HI>consider.</HI> in <HI>cap. 7. ad Rom.</HI> who denying the Inter∣pretation
of the seventh of the <HI>Romans,</HI> to be un∣derstood
personally of <HI>Paul,</HI> thinking this would
be injurious to the Grace of God sanctifying of
him, and making him so eminent a Servant in his
Church: He affirmeth, that if God pleased so to
adorn <HI>Paul</HI> with the gifts of the Spirit, that he
should in this life arrive at that fulness and perfe∣ction
of holiness, which other Believers obtain
no where but in Heaven, that thereby he might be
propounded as a perfect example to all Christi∣ans,
and his Ministry be more happily efficacious;
here was not (saith he) any thing to be blame∣worthy:
But though we grant <HI>Paul</HI> to have an el∣der
Brothers portion in the Graces and Gifts of
Christ, so that if no Minister could be saved, un∣less
he were a <HI>Paul,</HI> wo be to us all; yet that <HI>Paul</HI>
was not above the combate of the flesh and spirit
within him, appeareth partly <HI>in that careful</HI> keep∣ing
down of his body, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 27. lest sin should
prevail; as also in those buffetings of Satan which
<PB N="4" REF="267"/>
he was exercised with, that he might not be lifted
up above measure, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 7. Well, however
it be, the Apostle having both by rule and exam∣ple,
as you heard described what a Minister or
Pastor is to be, we have the consequent of this
in my Text: When he had thus spoken, thus of
himself, and thus of a Gospel-Minister, he kneel∣ed
down and prayed.</P>
<P>There are two actions of the body mentioned
in Prayer, which denote that excellent deport∣ment
that should be at that time in the soul; kneel∣ing
of the body, that denoteth self-humiliation;
lifting up the hands, that implieth faith and con∣fidence:
Thus <HI>descendendo ascenditur,</HI> how hard∣ly
do the people of God keep these two Graces
co-operating together, but either their Humilia∣tion
abateth their Faith, or their Faith hindreth
their Humiliation; both these together are the
<HI>Calidum</HI> and the <HI>Humidum,</HI> which maintain the life
of holy Duties; he Prayed as well as kneeled, for
that is the onely key to open Heaven, that is <HI>Da∣vids</HI>
Harp, to allay all those unruly affections that
are apt to disturb us.</P>
<P>Lastly, here is the effect of all upon the Audi∣tors,
which is expressed, First, In their passion of
weeping, with the aggravation. 1. <HI>They wept sore.</HI>
2. Their great love, <HI>They fell on Pauls neck and
kissed him.</HI> 3. The motive of all this affectionate
carriage, That which did open these Flood-gates,
it was because <HI>they should see his face no more;</HI> they
should for ever lose him, enjoy no more of his
Ministerial Labors and diligence: now this is re∣corded
<PB N="5" REF="267"/>
by the Evangelist, as a commendation; It
was a spirituall, not a naturall weeping; It was not
like weeping for a dead Father, or a dead Wife,
but for a dead Pastor, by whose spirituall labours
their souls had made great proficiency; I shall
from these words observe two doctrines suitable
to the two considerable parts of this auditory, the
one seasonable for the <HI>Ministers of the Gospel</HI> here
present, The other opportune for the <HI>Congregation
of Tamworth,</HI> now bereaved of a <HI>faithful Pastor,</HI>
whom I may see <HI>mourning</HI> and <HI>weeping,</HI> and that
<HI>most of all,</HI> because <HI>you shall see his face no more,</HI> you
shall not behold him in this place again, you shall
not hear his voice from hence again. The first
Observation is grounded upon these words, <HI>when
he had thus spoken,</HI> This about the <HI>duty of a Mini∣ster,</HI>
This about <HI>his Holy, Godly,</HI> and <HI>exemplary con∣versation;</HI>
From whence observe,</P>
<P><HI>That a faithful discharge of the ministeriall Office
doth bring unspeakable comfort to such as can upon just
grounds assume this to themselves;</HI> From this faith∣fulness
we see often <HI>Paul</HI> receiving a great deal of
comfort. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 6, 7, 8. The time of his departure
was at hand; doth not this then make him afraid?
how shall he give an account concerning the im∣provement
of his talents? No, <HI>I have fought a good
fight, I have finished my course, &amp;c.</HI> We have the
like glorious profession made by this holy Apo∣stle,
<HI>Thess.</HI> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. which is an excellent Copy
for every Minister to write after, to live and
breathe from thence; and in this he is so cleare,
that he saith, <HI>Ye are witnesses,</HI> and God also, how
<PB N="6" REF="268"/>
<HI>holily, justly</HI> and <HI>unblameably, we have behaved our
selves amongst those that beleeve.</HI> But yet let none
think that <HI>Paul</HI> doth thus magnifie inherent grace,
to exclude imputed grace, for 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 4. Though
he saith, he knoweth nothing by himself, yet he
concludeth, <HI>I am not thereby justified, but he that
judgeth me is the Lord,</HI> he knew more evill in <HI>Paul,</HI>
then <HI>Paul</HI> him self could do, and certainly, so great
is this ministerial work, that <HI>Paul</HI> himself cryed
out, <HI>Who is sufficient for these things? Chrysostome</HI>
hath very discouraging passages, as if few Mini∣sters
could be saved, but his meaning must be, be∣cause
few are carefull, zealous, and diligent; O∣therwise
such as <HI>Chrysostome</HI> himself, that is said to
fear nothing but sin, and those that by their Do∣ctrin
and life, turn many from iniquities, shall have
more then ordinary glory in heaven; To ampli∣fie
this, I shall in some <HI>particulars</HI> or Characters
describe how, or when the Ministery is faithfully
discharged, what is ingredient thereunto, or con∣stituent
thereof; And first there is required <HI>an in∣ward
experimental savory work of grace upon the Mi∣nisters
own heart,</HI> that thereby he may more <HI>affecti∣onately</HI>
and <HI>cordially</HI> deal with others; when we
know the terror of the Lord, and the love of
Christ experimentally, this maketh us able in the
work of the Ministery, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 11. I doe not say
that the Office of a Minister is null, if he be not a
regenerate man, or as if he were no Minister, or
might not be usefull in the Church of God, but as
to himself, he cannot faithfully discharge this Of∣fice,
so as to obtaine a crown of glory hereafter,
<PB N="7" REF="268"/>
unless he be thus qualified; There is <HI>Theologia ra∣tiocinativa</HI>
and <HI>experimentalis,</HI> as <HI>Gerson</HI> speaketh.
A man may know things, as <HI>Aquinas</HI> saith, <HI>per mo∣dum
cognitionis,</HI> or, <HI>per modum inclinationis;</HI> now
it is this experimental Divinitie, that worketh be∣sides
Knowledge an inclination and propensitie to
the thing known, that maketh us able to discharge
this duty; To Preach of Regeneration, of Faith,
when a man hath no savory understanding of these
things, is to talk of the sweetness of honey, when
we never tasted it, or of the excellency of such a
Countrey, which we never were in, but know it
by Mapps only. If thou knowest the truths of
God, but by Books, by Authors onely, and thy
own heart feeleth not the power of these things,
Thou art but as the Conduit, that letteth out wine
or refreshing water to others, but thou thy self
tastest not of it, or like the hand that directeth the
Passenger, but thou thy self standest still.</P>
<P>2. To a faithfull discharge, there is required a
<HI>sound knowledge, judgement</HI> and <HI>skill in divine
things;</HI> hence they are called <HI>lights, guides,</HI> and
<HI>Shepherds,</HI> they are required to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> 1 <HI>Tim.
3. 2. apt to teach, to reprove in all Doctrine. 2 Tim.</HI> 4.
2. It is not enough to cry out of Heresies or of
sinnes, unless we rebuke with doctrine; The least
Knowledge that <HI>Casuists</HI> condescend unto in a Mi∣nister
is, that he must be learned, <HI>supra vulgus fide∣lium:</HI>
Is he a fit Minister that can onely Preach and
pray by a prescript, or form from another? He is
not a fit Physitian, or a fit Lawyer, that should doe
so in his way; Ministers therefore should take
<PB N="8" REF="269"/>
that exhortation, which we see <HI>Paul</HI> gave even to
<HI>Timothy,</HI> though so well accomplished. 1 <HI>Tim. 4.
15. Meditate upon these things, give thy self wholly to
them, that thy profiting may appear,</HI> yea, <HI>vers. 13.
Till I come, give attendance to reading.</HI> The cir∣cumstance
of time is to be observed, for though
<HI>Paul</HI> was to come shortly to him, yet that little
time he was absent from <HI>Paul,</HI> must be improved
in reading Gods Word. Be thou ascribe instruct∣ed
for the Kingdome of heaven, that can bring out
of thy treasure, old and new; be a Fountain, not
a Cestern, that will quickly be dry; <HI>Cajetan Sum∣mula,
Tit. Doctoratus,</HI> maketh it a mortall sinne to
approve any for a Doctor in Divinitie, who is no∣tably
insufficient, because hereby he is testified to
be a Physitian of souls, when yet through his ig∣norance,
may be the ruine of many; I dare not
avouch that of <HI>Luther,</HI> who said it is a German
Proverb, <HI>that young Divines fill Hell,</HI> onely it is a
good warning, that such be diligent in studying,
that God may blesse them with all knowledge and
understanding, first in the Scripture, and then in
all other parts of Divinitie, whether controver∣sall,
positive or practicall, especially adde to thy
Ministeriall knowledge these two things; First <HI>a
firm faith,</HI> for to read and to know much, but not
to digest it, maketh us scepticall; Have faith, not
reason or opinion in religious things, <HI>Calvin</HI> saith
in <HI>Comment. 2. Epist. ad Corin.</HI> that the Ministers of
of God, who go up into the Pulpit in the name of
Christ, to preach his Word, ought to have such
firmness of Faith in them, that they are assured
<PB N="9" REF="269"/>
that their Doctrine can no more be overthrowne,
then God himself; now truely, this faith is much
to be commended to us, we may have much lear∣ning,
much reading, but little Faith, be very scep∣ticall,
and deale in Divinitie as we use to do in
Philosophy, <HI>videtur quod sic, videtur quod non,</HI>
Great Schollars are not alwayes great beleevers,
The want of this maketh a man of a <HI>Socinian</HI> faith,
an <HI>Arminian</HI> faith, a Popish faith, as often as any
plausible Argument, or carnal Interest interpo∣seth.</P>
<P>2. With this knowledge labour much after
<HI>Casuisticall Divinity,</HI> whereby you may be able to
direct the tempted in cases of Conscience, To
guide the afflicted in soul, what they are to doe;
Indeed the Papists have a deale of Casuisticall di∣vinitie
in large voluminous discourses, but it is
for the most part calculated according to their
meridians of superstitious usages and Customes,
but it is pitty that among us <HI>Protestants,</HI> our con∣troversall
Bookes are farre more then our casuisti∣call,
yet remember the Scripture calleth it, <HI>the
tongue of the Learned, Isa. 50. 4. To know how to speak
a word in season to him that is weary;</HI> The wounds
of Conscience are the most tender, and therefore
require a Spirituall skilfull Physitian. The Con∣sciences
of men are the subject matter of your Of∣fice,
and therefore look after that <HI>Ars Cordis,</HI>
which is indeed a liberall art that will set us
free.</P>
<P>3. He that will faithfully discharge the Office
of his Ministery, must regard the <HI>end of it,</HI> the
<PB N="10" REF="270"/>
<HI>finis operis,</HI> and <HI>finis operantis,</HI> the <HI>finis ministerii,</HI>
and <HI>ministri,</HI> must be all one: The end of the
Ministry is to exalt God &amp; Christ, to dethrone Sa∣tan,
to bring many out of their sins unto the obe∣dience
of the Gospel: Now if a man aim at other
things in his Ministry then this he can never com∣fortably
discharge it: To be a Minister for earth∣ly
profits, for ambition and vain glory, these will
be like the gravel, that will presently stop the
Ship in its passage; and truly herein we may much
lament our entrance in to this work, how many
set upon it as a profession to live upon, by that
they hope to satisfie their needs, but if this end
and motive do still reign in thee, it will be like a
milstone about thy neck; outward maintenance
may be a secondary end, but not the principal;
still then a we thy soul with the end of thy office,
that all other knowledge is exercised about the
body, or mens Estates, or the nature of things;
but thine is Theology, <HI>De Deo, à Deo, in Deum,</HI> its
concerning God objectively, its from God effe∣ctively,
its to God finally.</P>
<P>4. He that will faithfully discharge this Office
of the Ministry, must as <HI>Paul</HI> professeth, 2 <HI>Cor.
1. 12. have his conversation with all godly simplicity
and sincerity:</HI> He is to carry on his work in Scri∣pture-ways,
avoiding those two Rocks, <HI>Media
violentiae,</HI> and <HI>Media fraudulentiae;</HI> A man of a
crafty multiplicity of Spirit, will turn into any
shape dispute for any thing a lawful: This the
Jesuit said to one (for so I understand it) who
doubted about something he was to do, whe∣ther
<PB N="11" REF="270"/>
lawful or no, <HI>Aude</HI> (saith he) <HI>&amp; nos efficiemus
probabile, Jansen. St. August. lib. proaem. pag.</HI> 9. Be
daring to do it, and we will make it probable;
now this simplicity of Spirit in Ministerial im∣ployment,
is greatly seen in an obediential depend∣ance
upon the word of God, whether in matter
of Duty, or of Faith: What is it that maketh
so many learned Men embrace Errors after Er∣rors,
but because they leave Faith, and attend to
reason? They think we come to be Christians by
Disputations and scientifical Demonstrations; as
we come to be Philosophers, not by a single and
plain captivating of our understandings to the scri∣pture,
whereas it is Christian Faith, not Christian
reason: It is said to be <HI>Nazianzens</HI> Emblem, <HI>The∣ologia
nostra est Pythagorica,</HI> by this simplicity of
Spirit, a man shall overcome those Temptations,
which are usually in Scholars to bring, <HI>inaudita &amp;
invisa,</HI> strange and unheard things unto our Peo∣ple;
especially let the Ministers of the Gospel be
so guided by simplicity of Spirit, that they may a∣void
these three Rocks.</P>
<P>First, that while they avoid a Popish blinde o∣bedience
to men, examining things by Scripture,
they therefore do not make all things uncertain:
That of <HI>Durand</HI> is true, whosoever forsaketh
reason because of humane Authority, <HI>incidit in
insipientiam bestialem,</HI> maketh himself like a Beast;
yet let not this liberty be abused to licentiousness,
to believe nothing, to despise all those Ministerial
helps which God hath vouchsafed to the Church,
because he is to try all things; though he must
<PB N="12" REF="271"/>
try, yet he must not be always trying, <HI>but hold fast
that which is good, 1 Thess.</HI> 5. 21. This liberty and
particular Judgement of discerning, which God
alloweth every man, is not to be opposed to that
decisive Ministerial Judgement, which God hath
appointed in his Church.</P>
<P>Secondly, under pretence of a more moderate
and impartial handling of things, as not being ad∣dicted
unto parties, take heed thou do not make a
party of thy self, as the Sect of Philosophers, cal∣led
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Diogen, Laert. in Proent.</HI> pretend∣ing
they would be of no Sect, but choose the best
Art of all; thus they made a Sect, while they
condemned all.</P>
<P>Lastly, Take heed of being deceived under
the pretence that thou doest not bring in any new
matter, but new words, or thou dost digest things
into a better method; for by this means, men
leaving that simplicity and Scripture-dependance
they once had, have corrupted their Ministerial
Office, instead of a faithful discharge of it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, To a faithful discharge of this dread∣ful
Office, there is required an excellent com∣pound
<HI>of many choice Graces,</HI> insomuch that a Mi∣nisters
qualification, is like that Ointment that
was to be made for the Priest onely: There must
be love and compassion to Peoples Souls, which
was abundantly discovered in our Savior himself:
<HI>Paul</HI> compareth himself, sometimes to a Father,
sometimes to a Mother, sometimes to a Nurse,
because of this affectionate desire in him: There
must be Zeal, Fortitude, and Courage, the <HI>spirit
<PB N="13" REF="271"/>
of love and of power also;</HI> he is not a Minister, that
is not <HI>ad mille mortes paratus,</HI> said <HI>Chrysostome; as
a good Souldier endure hardship,</HI> saith <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timo∣thy,
1 Tim.</HI> 2. 3. There must be Prudence and
Wisdom, else Love and Power will make us like
<HI>Sampson,</HI> without eyes; there must be salt in the
Sacrifice, as well as fire; <HI>Oportet Pastor sit totus ocu¦lus,</HI>
a Pastor must be an <HI>Argus,</HI> full of eyes.</P>
<P>Again, there must be an <HI>Heavemly heart,</HI> con∣temning
the world and all earthly advantages:
The eye that is to see for others must not have
dust falling into it: <HI>Austin</HI> maketh an Heretick to
have some carnal profit or emolument that is at∣tractive
of him: There must be a <HI>desire to please
God, and not men,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. for so a man
cannot be a servant of Christ: This fear to dis∣please
men, whereby we do not reprove sin so
Zealously, so Cordially and Faithfully as we
should, hath eclipsed the comfort of some godly
Ministers at their death. It is too true that the
Wise man saith, <HI>The fear of a man is his snare,
Prov.</HI> 29. 25. The Camelion for fear, saith <HI>Ari∣stotle,</HI>
turneth into the likeness of every object it
meeteth with.</P>
<P>These are the special qualifications of a Godly
Minister, whereby he will be able to say with <HI>Paul,
I have fought a good fight. 1 Tim.</HI> 4. 7. Yea, with
<HI>CHRIST, I have finished the worke thou gavest
me to do. John</HI> 17. 3. To all which must be added
<HI>diligence</HI> and <HI>labour,</HI> all the names, they have denote
labour more then glory, office more then dignitie;
now in all these things there is one particular,
<PB N="14" REF="272"/>
which doth much quicken, and that is <HI>temptation,</HI>
one of those three things, <HI>Luther</HI> said, made a Di∣vine;
we are not to desire temptations, but God
for the most part doth prepare those Ministers,
whom he intends to be serviceable, by such exer∣cises;
This is the sawing, and the polishing of the
stone, by this he is brought into the deep wa∣ters,
and seeth the wonderfull works of God, by
this he is able to understand the depths of Satan,
and by this he is adapted to be a most speciall In∣strument
to comfort and refresh others, when
they shall see theirs is not a singular condition, they
must not think none are tempted like them, for
they shall find that even <HI>Pauls</HI> have had the buffe∣tings
of Satan, and that by these soule temptati∣ons
they have learned more then all Books or au∣thors
could teach them. And thus I leave the first
Doctrine, and proceed to the second, which
is.</P>
<P>That a Godly People cannot but affectionately mourn
under the losse of their faithfull Ministers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>You see here what these <HI>Ephesians</HI> did, with
what affection they were moved, because they
should never see <HI>Pauls</HI> face more; Grace doth not
lie in extinguishing, but regulating affections;
<HI>Christ wept,</HI> and they argued from thence, <HI>behold
how he loved him, Joh.</HI> 11. 35, 36. So that <HI>Nazian∣zens</HI>
commendation of his Mother <HI>Nonna,</HI> that she
never wept under the many troubles she under∣went,
submitting all to Gods hand, was rather
Stoicisme, then Christianitie; It is said of <HI>Am∣brose,</HI>
when he heard of the death of any good
<PB N="15" REF="272"/>
Minister, he could not forbeare weeping; how then
can a people forbeare, when their own Minister,
their own Pastor is taken away, should not the
Congregation be a valley of tears, or a place of
mourners; now there are these grounds for it, 1. Be∣cause
of that experimentall soul-good, and spiritu∣all
advantage the Godly have reapt thereby; Oh!
when thou shalt remember what quicknings, what
meltings, what warning of heart thou hast had,
this will cause grief to think they are gone. Car∣nall
naturall men never are affected with the losse
of a Minister, they never got any good by their
Preaching; it was no converting Ministry, no in∣lightning,
no comforting Ministry to them, and
therefore the loss is no more troublesome.</P>
<P>2. They must needs mourn, because they have
just cause to fear, their sinnes have caused God to
deprive them of such helps; your unthankfulness,
your contempt, and low thoughts of the means of
grace, your unprofitableness and negligence, may
make you mourn, for if God upon the abuse of
naturall Creatures, will take away his Wine, his
Bread, his flaxe, will he not much more remove
the candlestick, for unfruitfulness under spiritual
mercies; mourne then, lest thy sinnes, thy un∣faithfulness,
thy deadness and dulness of heart
have provoked God to take such guides away; yea
in the third place, may not some mourn, who by
their Disobedience, and unwillingnesse to sub∣mit
to Christs yoak, and opposition to his way,
have so filled the Ministers heart with grief and
sadness, as thereby to hasten his death, making
<PB N="16" REF="273"/>
his life the more uncomfortable, and causing him
to mourn in secret for your stubbornness and dis∣obedience;
Thus your sinnes, not only meritori∣ously,
but efficiently may concurre to the remo∣ving
of him by death; Consider that place. <HI>Heb.
13. 17. Obey them that rule over you, &amp;c. that they
may give their account with joy, and not with grief;</HI>
some make this particular to relate to the former,
that they may watch over your souls with joy,
and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.
A grieved Minister, a discouraged Minister cannot
do his duty, so powerfully, it will be unprofitable
unto you, you will find it in his study, in his ser∣mons;
A dull people are apt to make a dull Mi∣nister.</P>
<P>4. There is cause to mourn, because of the ex∣cellencie
of the relation between a Pastor and a
People, in some respects, it is above all natu∣rall
relations. They are spirituall Fathers, your
souls receive good by them; They are Instru∣mentall
to bring you unto eternal glory, and
therefore there is more cause of Mourning in this
respect, then when God breaketh naturall rela∣tions,
no Father or Mother, or friend happily hath
done that for thee which his Ministery hath
done.</P>
<P>5. There is cause to mourn, because it is a
sign of Gods anger and displeasure to a people,
you are not so much to look upon it; as the losse
of a man, as a token of Gods anger to the congre∣gation;
<HI>The righteous man perisheth, and none layeth
it to heart. Isaiah.</HI> 57. 1. Who knoweth what soul-Judgements,
<PB N="17" REF="273"/>
what bodily Judgements may hereaf∣ter
come vpon you, and therefore it is for a peo∣ple
to be sensible, and mourn, when the desire of
your eies, so I may call the Minister (as well as the
Wife) is taken away. The desire of your eies,
you long to see him in the Pulpit again, and the
desire of your eares, you long to heare him a∣gain.</P>
<P>6. There is cause to Mourn, because of the sad
consequents that many times falls upon the death
of a faithfull Pastor; sometimes the learning and
soundness of a Minister, keepeth a People from
licentious errors, and corrupt opinions; His Gra∣vitie
and Pietie hath a speciall influence upon ma∣ny,
but upon his removall, then the weeds of a
mans heart growes up: <HI>After my departure,</HI> saith
<HI>Paul, Wolves will arise from among your selves, Acts
20. 29. Pauls</HI> presence was a great means to hinder
them.</P>
<P>2. What good Foundation is laid in Faith, what
Godly Order may be begun? there is danger, that
all these will die, when a Faithfull Minister dieth:
<HI>I wonder that you are so soon removed,</HI> saith <HI>Paul, Gal.</HI>
1. Alas! that which the Ministers of God have
with many years diligence, many Prayers, and
much opposition brought about, when the Mini∣ster
is dead, may quickly be destroyed, so that we
may wonder, how such a Town, such a place
should be over-run with Bryars and Thornes im∣mediately.</P>
<P>3. Another sad consequent is sometimes, divi∣sions
and breaches among the People, while a
<PB N="18" REF="274"/>
Godly Minister is alive, he is like a Corner Stone,
that uniteth both sides of the Wall together, but
when that falls, then the wall falls with it. Then
one is for this Minister, and another for that, then
one liketh this, and another the contrary, and thus
seeds of contention and division are sowen, which
may come up too fast, hence the presence of a
Godly, Grave, Wise Pastor is very necessary, it is
the Spirituall defence of a People, which made
him cry out, when the Prophet was taken, <HI>My fa∣ther,
my Father, the Chariots of Israel, and the horse∣men
thereof, 2 Kings</HI> 13. 14. And now we come
from the Doctrinal part to the practicall; And
although my custome in such Sermons, is not to
discourse about the Dead, they being like Anato∣my
Lectures, for the good of the living, yet be∣cause
we are celebrating the Funeralls of a Learn∣ed
and Godly Brother, who by his Office, was in
publick station in the Church of God; I shall brief∣ly
speak to some few of those Ministeriall qualifi∣cations,
that were in him mentioned in the Do∣ctrine,
not imitating <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> who in his Fu∣nerall
Orations of his Father, as also <HI>Athanasius,
Basilius</HI> and others industriously gathereth up eve∣ry
thing that may make to their praise, if not hy∣perbolically
exceeding sometimes; but I shall ra∣ther
come short of what might be spoken. And
first, his Doctrinall abilities, and parts in contro∣vsrsall
points, are sufficiently known by the Books
he hath written: those Children will resemble the
Father, though he left no bodily ones. It is true,
there were some particular opinions and con∣tests
<PB N="19" REF="274"/>
he was fallen into with other Learned men,
on whose side the truth did stand, you will not
judge it meet for me to interpose, onely because
of the difference that is sometimes in Judgement
between Godly men, we see some by profaneness,
gladly have it in their mouthes, saying, what heed
is to be given to these Ministers, there are not two
of a minde; They write against one another, they
have Book against Book, and then some good
people they are offended; what shall we do, say
they, we look upon both as Godly, and yet they
cannot agree; because I say, of this offence, I shall
speak a little to it. First, that this difference a∣mongst
our selves, is an old objection, The <HI>Pa∣gans</HI>
and the <HI>Jewes</HI> urged it against Christianity,
whose Arguments <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> answered,
retorting upon them the same divisions; the <HI>Philo∣sophers</HI>
likewise objected this to the Christians,
when that <HI>Synod</HI> was gathered together at <HI>Nice,</HI>
as the Centuriators inform us; Though <HI>Augu∣stine
(lib. de vera religione</HI>) brandeth them for
this, that the Heathens, though they had divers
schools, yet they had <HI>Commune Templum,</HI> a Com∣mon
temple, which argued, they worshipped
their Gods more out of Custome, then because of
their opinion.</P>
<P>2. We are to know, that all the Godly do know
onely in part, perfection in knowledge, and unity
is reserved for heaven; there will be no parties,
no dividing opinions, there will be no different
Forms, and wayes of worshipping of God in that
place, so that although this difference amongst the
<PB N="20" REF="275"/>
Godly be as <HI>Calvin</HI> said to <HI>Melanctlhon, pessimi ex∣empli,</HI>
of a very bad example, yet if we consider,
that the measure of Light &amp; grace in this world is
imperfect, then we may not wonder at such brea∣ches;
had not <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> a Paroxisme, a
sharp sitt, for to understand the Word in a good
sense, as some would, because the Word is used so.
<HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 24. is very improbable. <HI>Austin</HI> and <HI>Hie∣rome,
Chrysostome</HI> and <HI>Epiphanius</HI> had great con∣tests.</P>
<P>3. The differences of Godly Ministers are not
in fundamentals; They all build gold and preci∣ous
stones, though some may adde hay and stub∣ble</P>
<P>Lastly, a brotherly and amicable disquisition
into truths controversed, not fundamentall, but
between Godly men, though different in Judge∣ments,
is very lawfull and usefull, indeed if this be
done with pride, passion, scornfull and disdainfull
words, despising the gifts of others, This is not a
dead fly, but a dead toad in the box of ointment,
that maketh the wise Reader think, men do re∣gard
opinions, not so much as they are Gods
Truths, but as they are their opinions, wherein
they must have glory; But return we to our Lear∣ned
Brother; as God had given him such Doctri∣nall
Abilities, so also was he Prudent and Wise,
and wise to direct such as were troubled in
their minde, and perplexed about what they
were to doe; It is true, it pleased God be∣fore
his sickness to exercise him with some sad
<PB N="21" REF="275"/>
and black thoughts, sometimes tending to the
great dejection and discouragement of his soul,
but by this we see, that comfort is not a flower
growing in our Garden, that we can pluck up
when we will, God is the God of Comfort only,
he giveth it when he pleaseth, and he taketh it a∣way
again as he pleaseth. Christ had an Angel to
comfort him in his Agonies, so that all, both Mi∣nisters
and People, are to take Gospel-Consolati∣ons,
as mercies from heaven, not as the work of
our hands.</P>
<P>In the next place, the diligence, constancy and
faithfull Preaching of your Godly Pastor is not
unknown; These walls, these seats can sufficiently
beare witness thereunto; Though you a great
People, and he declining in age, yet a laborious
Preacher to you, and a great Student in private:
The Catechizing also of the younger sort of peo∣ple,
discovered his vigilancy, and it was the ear∣nest
desire (as he would have you informed) and
request of your dying Pastor, that the younger
Persons of this place would readily and willingly
submit to that order; Besides all this, his writing
for the publick good of the Church, still demon∣strated
his faithfulness and zeal herein; when the
Persecutor had cut out <HI>Cyprians</HI> tongue, and then
banished him, yet he made a supply by his Pen;
but our Learned Brother was willing both by
Tongue and Pen to edifie the Church of God, so
that both his <HI>opuscula,</HI> and his <HI>opera</HI> will praise him
in the gates, <HI>His tenderness of Spirit</HI> likewise was
exceeding much; and as in soft wood, wormes
<PB N="22" REF="276"/>
sometimes breed to weaken it, so did (as you
heard) discouragements sometimes lie upon his
soul, but the Lord did quickly blow over the
clouds, and as I am informed, his expression was,
<HI>That he dyed with full satisfaction of Spirit, and com∣munion
with God.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, you are not ignorant of the way he took
about the Sacrament, that he was not for the pro∣miscuous
Admission of all thereunto; and there∣fore
when a late Writer, Mr. <HI>Humphreys,</HI> would
have gathered such conclusions from his prin∣ciples,
he was willing publickly to vindicate him∣self,
and to shew his dissent herein; All this,
though comparatively little, I have spoken, not to
exalt man, for what have we, that we have not re∣ceived,
but to bless God, and magnifie him, who
giveth such gifts to men; he that praiseth the gifts
and graces of any, thereby extolleth God; as he
that commendeth a Picture, magnifieth the Arti∣ficer
that made it; and thus we take our dear and
last farewell of him, and come to you, sheep left
without a shepheard, to you on the Sea without a
Pilate; To you Orphans, without a Spirituall Fa∣ther;
and first you see what cause there is for our
constant expectation and preparation for death;
Gods own Ministers and servants must dye, God
needeth no mans labours or parts, <HI>Moses, Joshua,
Paul, Peter</HI> must die, <HI>sola mors non habet fortasse,</HI>
said <HI>Austin,</HI> only Death hath no may be; It may be
thou mayest be rich, it may be thou mayest thrive
in thy trading, it may be thou mayest have com∣fort
<PB N="23" REF="276"/>
in thy Children and friends, but thy death hath
no may be; Oh! let not the world, let not your
Shops, let not trading take off your hearts from
this Meditation, but think you hear God speaking
to you, set not your house, but your souls in or∣der,
for thou must die.</P>
<P>And secondly, here is some comfort, though
there be cause of much sorrow, that though your
Faithfull Pastor he dead, yet the chief Pastor of
your souls is not; He that setteth Pastors and
Teachers in the Church, he that sendeth forth la∣bourers
into his harvest, he liveth for ever; as
one in the Ecclesiasticall History, when newes was
brought him that his father was dead, <HI>Desine blasphe∣mias
loqui</HI> (saith he) <HI>pater enim meus immortalis est,</HI>
cease to speak blasphemy, for my Father is im∣mortall;
Thus let this honey fall into your gall,
this Wine into your water, The great and Chief
Shepheard of your souls is not dead.</P>
<P>Lastly, now the will of God is done, concern∣ing
our deceased Brother, your duty is to be much
in <HI>Prayer</HI> to God, that there may be a <HI>Joshua</HI> after
<HI>Moses,</HI> That God would <HI>joyne your hearts together
as one man,</HI> to seek out a Pastor for you, which
shall feed you according to his holy will; The
Lord hath made a great breach upon you, be sen∣sible
of it, and seriously consider how all your soul∣comforts
and advantages are bound up in this mat∣ter;
Ministers are compared to the Sun, and Salt,
<HI>nihil sole &amp; sale ut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lius;</HI> can you be without the
<PB N="24" REF="277"/>
Sun in the heavens? without bread for your bo∣dy,
so neither without this bread of life for your
souls, or without this light to guide you in the
wildernesse of this World, to eternall happi∣nesse.</P>

<HEAD>A Funerall Oration at the Death of
the most desired Mr. Blake. By Mr. Samuel Shaw, then School-master
of the Free-School at Tamworth.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Ith a face sadder then usuall, with an heart
sadder then my face, but upon an occasion
sadder then them both, I (who was deputed
to this work by him to whom I now per∣form
it) am here, rather to receive the ex∣pressions
of your sorrow, then tell you the resentments of
mine own. Being sensible of my stupefaction, (caused, not
through the want of my affections, but the want of their
object) I desire out of a pious pollicy, to supply my drynesse,
by taking your Tears, and putting them into my pump, so
hoping to revive mine own, which yet I judge are rather
drowned then dryed up. And yet when I have done this,
I know that all my expressions will fall short of the great∣ness
of my grief, as much as my grief does of the great∣ness
of its cause. This numerous Company of Pious groan∣ers,
these so many blacks, not made, but occasioned to be
Mourners (badges of profession becomming badges of that
grief, which for its greatness can be equal'd by nothing
but their former happiness which they once enjoyed) the
universall gloommess of this day, represents to me rather
the funerall of a Town, then a man, and the fall of a
Church, rather then a single pillar: and rather induces
<PB REF="278"/>
me to think that ye are come to quench the unmer∣cifull
heat of a feaver, then only to bedew that which was
the subject of one. But if it may be, hold a little, and suf∣fer
your eyes a while to a new employment, even to see
where you are, what you are doing, whose Obsequies you
are solemnizing with so great devotion, and take the di∣mensions
of your losse, if it be capable of any: which
indeed is so great, that they only can know it, who knew
not him, and they onely can feel, who never enjoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him;
I speak not to aggravate your loss, but the sense of it, as
for the cause of it, it admits of no addition. Whilst he
lived, it was as impossible for him not to love you, as it
was for you ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quately to return his love: His care an∣swered
his love; and if his successe had answered his
care, we might happily have this day wanted an
object of so great sorrow, in enjoying him. His writing▪
were not read without satisfaction: His Sermons were ne∣ver
heard without an approving silence, seldom without a
following advantage. His kindness towards you could
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot be considered without love, his awfull gravity, and
secretly-commanding presence, without reverence: Nor
his conversation, without imitation. To see him live, was
a provocation to a godly life; to see him dying, might
have made any one aweary of living▪ When God restrains
him from this place (which was alwayes happy in his
company but now) he made his chamber a Church, and
his bed a Pulpit, in which (in my hearing) he offered ma∣ny
a hearty prayer for you: And his death made him mind∣full
of you, whose life made you unmindfull of him, And
I did not see that any thing made him so backward to re∣sign
up his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure soul to God, as his unparalell'd care for
you, and your proficiency in godliness, which seemed as
<PB REF="278"/>
little to him, in comparison of what he desired, as it does
great to others in comparison of what they finde; so that
I sate by him, and I only, when with as great affluency of
Tears, as words, he prayed, Lord (with some ingeminati∣ons)
charge not on me the ignorance of this people. And
indeed your ignorance had not been so remarkable, had not
his Knowledge, and desire still to communicate it been
so. With what a grace and majesty have you heard him
Preaching, who is now (alas) confin'd to a worser wood.
Could you ever resist the power by which he spake; or find
in your hearts to contradict any thing that ever he said,
but when on his sick-bed he said, I am a dying man? Ah!
who would not there have contradicted him, if they
should not have contradicted Gods Decree! His Wisedome,
Justice, and Tenderness were such predomin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Graces in
him, that it is as much my inability to describe them, as
my unhappinesse not to im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate them: And truly, to think
to expresse them, were infinitely to injure their greatness.
It is a sad thing that so many resplendent graces should ne∣ver
be so truly, nor so fully discovered, as by the loss of him
that had them; and that we should not so justly consider
that he had them, till we have not them. But yet your
losse might be the better borne, if ye were sure it had no∣thing
of a Judgement in it. But I fear that within a short
time, it will appear as truly that God hath taken him a∣way
in anger, as now it appears sadly that he hath taken
him away: And that it is not only a misery that must be
repayred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a change of Pastors, but also a sin which must
be re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>est by the change of your lives: For, if your u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣worthinesse
have driven your teacher is to a corner, and
you sinn'd him into his grave; your Repentance and Humi∣liation
must raise another out of his ashes. So great, so saa,
<PB REF="279"/>
so generall is this losse, that I am ready to excuse my self,
and think it more reason then passion, if in my solitary
