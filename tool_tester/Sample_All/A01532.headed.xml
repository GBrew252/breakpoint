<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>E pleased (I pray thee) to vn∣derstand in a word, as <HI>the occasion of vndertaking,</HI> so <HI>the motiue of publishing</HI> this <HI>Controuersie.</HI> Hauing had some <HI>Conference</HI> with <HI>an Honourable Lady nobly de∣scended,</HI> whom some <HI>Factors</HI> for <HI>Rome</HI> had endea∣uoured to peruert, about the <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Transub∣stantiation,</HI> and <HI>Christs corporall presence in the Eu∣charist;</HI> I was by her requested to deliuer her in writing, the summe of that that had passed then by word of mouth from me, as well in way of <HI>Answere</HI> to the <HI>exceptions</HI> taken to <HI>our Doctrine,</HI> as in way of <HI>opposition</HI> to <HI>the Romane tenet</HI> therein. Whereupon within a few daies after, hauing di∣gested it as well as streights of time would per∣mit, and added some further <HI>enforcements</HI> of the generall <HI>heads</HI> then insisted on, I deliuered it <HI>ver∣batim</HI> as here thou now hast it. Which writing being imparted to one of those <HI>Factors, a speedy answere</HI> was promised, and (after <HI>long expectation</HI> of it) at length performed, such as here it is exhi∣bited (vnder the letters of <HI>N.

added, or altred. Vnto which I soone after dispeeded <HI>a Reply;</HI> which was to the same <HI>Honourable Personage</HI> also not long after repre∣sented. Now hauing hitherto heard of nothing returned further thereunto, (albeit some yeeres be past since the exhibition of it) I haue thought good by the aduice of some <HI>iudicious Friends</HI> to publish all together (my <HI>Reply</HI> onely in some few places enlarged) as well thereby the more fully to cleere some <HI>obiections</HI> vrged commonly (to the simpler sort especially) against <HI>our Faith</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> concerning <HI>that Sacrament,</HI> and our <HI>ex∣position</HI> of some passages of <HI>holy writ,</HI> either con∣cerning, or supposed to concerne the same; as al∣so further to discouer (to such especially as are not so well acquainted therewith) <HI>the grosse and palpable frauds and falshoods,</HI> with such <HI>Popish Factours</HI> too frequent, which in the aduised rea∣ding and perusing hereof may easily and euident∣ly be descried. And this is all that (not listing to detaine thee long from the <HI>discourse</HI> it selfe) I was desirous by way of <HI>Preface</HI> to fore-acquaint thee withall. The <HI>Lord</HI> vouchsafe thee and vs all <HI>true vnderstanding, sound iudgement,</HI> and <HI>a loue of the truth</HI> both in this and in all other things.</P>

<HEAD>A Briefe Discourse conteining di∣uers Arguments against the Popish Doctrine of Transubstantiation.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Question</HI> is, whither <HI>Christ be cor∣porally present in the Sacrament of the Eucharist by vertue of a Transubstan∣tiation or a reall conuersion of the Bread and Wine into the naturall Body and Blood of Christ.</HI> This those of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> affirme, we deny; &amp; refuse to yeeld to for these <HI>Reasons.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That which no <HI>Scripture</HI> enforceth vpon vs, that in matter of <HI>Faith</HI> wee are not bound to beleeue. For the <HI>Scripture</HI> is the <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Faith.</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">In his, quae apertè posita sunt in Scrip∣tura, inveni∣untur illa om∣nia, quae con∣tinent fidem, moresque vi∣uendi. Aug. de doctr. Christ. l. 2. c. 9.</NOTE> <HI>In it</HI> (saith <HI>August.) are found all those things, Which concerne faith and good life.</HI> And, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Hoc quiá de Scripturis au∣thoritatē non habet, eadem facilitate con∣temnitur, qua probatur. Hieron. in Math. c. 23.</NOTE> <HI>That which hath not authoritie from it,</HI> (saith <HI>Ierome) may as easily be reiected, as it is auerred.</HI> And, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Nihil de co constat, quia Scriptura non exhibet. Tertull. de carn. Christ.</NOTE> <HI>Of that</HI> (saith <HI>Tertullian) there is no certaintie, that the Scripture hath not.</HI></P>
<P>But that <HI>Christ is present corporally in the Sacrament of the Eucharist by vertue of any such Transubstantiation or reall conversion of the Creatures into the naturall Body and Blood of Christ,</HI> no <HI>Scripture</HI> enforceth vs to beleeue. Nor are we therefore bound to beleeue it.</P>
<P>That no <HI>Scripture</HI> enforceth vs to beleeue it, shall ap∣peare by examination of those <HI>places</HI> that are alleadged commonly to prooue it. The <HI>places</HI> vsually produced are principally <HI>two.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
The <HI>former place</HI> is out of the <HI>Institution</HI> it selfe; those words of our Sauiour, <HI>This is my Body. Matth. 26. 26. Marke 14. vers. 22. Luke 22. vers. 19. 1. Corinth. 11. vers.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>That these words enforce vs not to beleeue any such thing, is thus prooued. If these words may well be taken <HI>figuratiuely,</HI> as well as some other <HI>speeches</HI> of the like kinde in <HI>Scripture,</HI> and other the like <HI>phrases</HI> vsuall in ordinary speech, then these words enforce vs not to beleeue any such thing. But these words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> may well be ta∣ken <HI>figuratiuely</HI> as well as other <HI>speeches</HI> of the like kinde in <HI>Scripture,</HI> to wit, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 41. 26, 27. Septē boues, &amp; septem spi∣cae septem an∣ni sunt: &amp; non dicit sep∣tem annos significant. Aug. in Leuit. quaest. 57.</NOTE> <HI>The seauen kine, and the seauen eares are seauen yeeres:</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Apoc. 17. 12.</NOTE> <HI>The ten hornes are ten Kings:</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10. 4.</NOTE> <HI>The Rocke was Christ:</HI> and as other <HI>phrases</HI> vsuall in ordinary speech, as <NOTE N="ff" PLACE="marg">Intuentes tabulam aut parietem dici∣mus; Ille Ci∣cero est; ille Salustius, ille Achilles, ille Hector: hoc flumen Simo∣is; illa Roma, cum aliud nihil sint quam pictae imagines: &amp; omnes ferè imagines earum rerum quarum imagines sunt, nominibus appellati solent. Aug. ad Simpl. lib. 2. quaest. 3.</NOTE> when pointing to the <HI>pictures</HI> of <HI>Alexander, Caesar, William the Conquerour, Virgil, Liuie</HI> and the like, we say, <HI>This is Alexander that conquered Asia; This is Caesar that conquered France; This is King William that conquered England; This is Virgil that wrote of Aeneas; This is Liuie that wrote the Romane storie;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>These words therefore enforce vs not to beleeue that <HI>Christ is corporally present in the Sacrament, by vertue of any such Transubstantiation.</HI></P>
<P>The truth hereof is acknowledged euen by our Aduersa∣ries themselues. <HI>Cardinal Bellarmine</HI> granteth that <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Haec verba necessario inferunt, aut veram mutationem panis, vt volunt Catholici, aut mutationem metaphoricam, vt volunt Caluinistae; nullo autem modo sententiam Lutheranorum admittunt. Bellarm. de Euchar. l. 2. c. 19.</NOTE> <HI>these words,</HI> This is my Body, <HI>may imply either such a reall change of the Bread as the Catholikes hold, or such a figuratiue change as the Caluinists hold, but will not beare that sense that the Lu∣therans giue them.</HI> And, <HI>Cardinal Caietan</HI> acknowledgeth and freely confesseth, that <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Non apparet ex Euangelio coactivum aliquod ad intelligendum haec verba propriè. Cajetan. in Thom. part. 3. quaest. 75. art. 1.</NOTE> <HI>there appeareth not any thing out of the Gospel that may enforce vs to vnderstand those words
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
properly.</HI> This is my body. And he addeth that <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ex subi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ctis verbis non potest concludi eui∣denter prae∣miss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> verba esse intelli∣gendapropriè. Ibid. Et po∣steà; cum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣ius relationis veritate stat praeiacentem esse veram so∣lum in sensu metaphorico: vt patet in exemplo, Pe∣tra autem erat Christus, non propriè sed metaphoricè inteiligenda. Et similiter illa proposi∣tio, (Hoc est corpus me∣um) esset vera, si in solo me∣taphorico sensu esset p olata.</NOTE> <HI>nothing in the text hindreth but that those words,</HI> This is my body, <HI>may as well be taken in a metaphoricall sense, as those words of the A∣postle,</HI> The Rocke was Christ: and that <HI>the words of either proposition may well be true, though the thing there spoken be not vnderstood in a proper sense, but in a metaphorical sense onely.</HI> And I finde alleadged out of <HI>Bishop Fisher</HI> in a worke of his against <HI>Luther</HI> (for the booke I haue not) these words; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Hactenus Matthaeus; Neque est hic vnum verbū vnde probetur in Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a no∣stra vera car∣nis &amp; Sar∣guinis Chri∣sti presentia. Ioan Rof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ēs. contr. Captiu. Babylon.</NOTE> <HI>There is not one word in S. Mathewes Gospel, from which the true presence of Christs flesh &amp; blood in our Masse may be prooued.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex Scriptura probari non potest. Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Out of Scripture it cannot be prooued.</HI> Thus by the <HI>Confession</HI> of our <HI>Aduersaries</HI> themselues, our Sauiours words may well beare that meaning that we giue them, and there is nothing in the <HI>Text</HI> that may enforce vs to ex∣pound or vnderstand them otherwise.</P>
<P>It is absurd therefore for any to reason thus, as many yet are wont to doe; <HI>Christ saith,</HI> This is my Body: <HI>and we are bound to beleeue Christ:</HI> and <HI>therefore we must needs beleeue that Christ is corporally present in the Sacrament.</HI> Since that <HI>the words of Christ</HI> by our <HI>Aduersaries</HI> their owne <HI>confession</HI> may be <HI>most true,</HI> and yet no such thing at all be meant by them, or intended in them. And the same may well be shewed, (as <HI>Caietan</HI> pointeth vs to it) by the like. For must we not beleeue <HI>the Apostle</HI> as well as <HI>Christ?</HI> or must we not beleeue <HI>Christ</HI> as well in one place as in an other? But the Apostle saith, that <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Corinth. 10. 4.</NOTE> <HI>The Rocke was Christ:</HI> And yet no man beleeueth therefore that <HI>the rocke was tur∣ned into Christ;</HI> though he beleeue the Apostles words in that place. Yea our Sauiour himselfe saith; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Luke 12. 20.</NOTE> <HI>This Cup is the new Testament:</HI> and, <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Matth. 26. 28.</NOTE> <HI>This Cup is my Blood.</HI> And yet is no man so senselesse as therefore to beleeue that <HI>the Cuppe</HI> which our Sauiour then held, <HI>was turned</HI> either <HI>into the New Testament,</HI> or <HI>into Christs blood.</HI> As well therefore may a man prooue that <HI>the Rocke was turned into Christ,</HI> because
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
the Apostle saith <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Non dicit, Petia signifi∣cat Christum; sed tanquam hoc esset, quod vtique per substantiam non erat, sed per significa∣tionem, Petra autem erat Christus. Aug. in Leuit. quae. 57.</NOTE> not, <HI>The Rocke signified Christ,</HI> but ex∣pressely, <HI>The Rocke was Christ:</HI> or that <HI>the communicants themselues are turned into bread,</HI> because the Apostle saith, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10. 4.</NOTE> <HI>We are all one Bread: or that the Cup was turned</HI> either <HI>into the New Testament,</HI> or <HI>into Blood;</HI> because our Sauiour saith, <HI>This Cup is the New Testament;</HI> and, <HI>This Cup is my Blood:</HI> as that <HI>the bread is turned into the Body of Christ,</HI> because our Sauiour saith of it, <HI>This is my Body. The Rocke was Christ</HI> onely <HI>symbolically</HI> and <HI>sacramentally,</HI> by representati∣on and resemblance: and <HI>the Cup,</HI> that is, <HI>the wine in the Cup,</HI> (for so our Sauiour saith it was, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Math. 26. 29.</NOTE> <HI>the fruite of the vine) was the New Testament,</HI> as <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gen. 17. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Circumcision the Couenant,</HI> as <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gen. 17. 11.</NOTE> <HI>a signe and</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 11.</NOTE> <HI>a seale of it.</HI> And in like manner is <HI>the bread</HI> said to be <HI>the Body of Christ,</HI> as <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Exo. 12. 11.</NOTE> <HI>the Paschal Lambe</HI> is cal∣led <NOTE PLACE="marg">Petra Chri∣stus in signo, Aug. in Ioan. tract. 26. quia significat Christum.

<DIV2 TYPE="summary">
<HEAD>The <HI>Summe</HI> of all that hath beene said.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THat there is nothing in the Gospel whereby it may appeare that those words of our Sauiour, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> may not be <HI>figuratiuely</HI> vnderstood, is by <HI>Cardinal Caietan</HI> confessed.</P>
<P N="2">2. That our Sauiours words of <HI>eating his flesh and drin∣king his blood</HI> are to be vnderstood <HI>not corporally</HI> but <HI>spiritu∣ally,</HI> is acknowledged by <HI>many Popish writers</HI> of great note: and is, beside other <HI>Reasons,</HI> by <HI>a Rule</HI> giuen <HI>by Augustine</HI> euidently prooued.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the <HI>Elements</HI> in the Sacrament remaine in <HI>Sub∣stance</HI> the same, and are not <HI>really transubstantiated into Christs Body and Blood,</HI> is euinced by diuers <HI>Arguments.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. From <HI>the Course of the Context,</HI> which plainely shew∣eth, that <HI>Christ brake</HI> and <HI>deliuered</HI> no other then <HI>he tooke and blessed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. From the expresse words of <HI>Scripture,</HI> that calleth the one <HI>Bread,</HI> and the other <HI>Wine,</HI> euen <HI>after consecration.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. From <HI>the Nature of Signes,</HI> whose propertie it is <HI>to be one thing,</HI> and <HI>to signifie another</HI> thing.</P>
<P N="4">4. From <HI>the Nature of Christs Body,</HI> that hath <HI>flesh, blood,</HI> and <HI>bones,</HI> which the <HI>Eucharisticall bread</HI> hath not, that.
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>
which our <HI>taste,</HI> our <HI>sight,</HI> and our <HI>sense</HI> informeth vs, by which <HI>our Sauiour</HI> himselfe hath taught vs to discerne <HI>his body.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. From <HI>the nature of euery true Body,</HI> such as Christs is, which cannot be in <HI>many places</HI> at once, nor haue any <HI>part</HI> of it greater then the <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. From <HI>the qualitie of the Communicants, good</HI> and <HI>bad,</HI> promiscuously feeding on the <HI>Elements</HI> in the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> whereas none but the <HI>faithfull</HI> can feede vpon <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. From these <HI>infirme</HI> and <HI>vnseemely,</HI> yea <HI>foule</HI> and <HI>filthy</HI> things that doe vsually, or may befall the <HI>Elements</HI> in the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> which no <HI>Christian eare</HI> can endure to heare that they should befall <HI>Christs blessed and glorious body.</HI></P>
<P>Whence I conclude, that since this <HI>Corporall presence,</HI> such as <HI>the Church of Rome</HI> maintaineth, hath no warrant from <HI>Gods word,</HI> as their owne <HI>Cardinal</HI> confesseth; and is be∣sides contrary to <HI>Scripture,</HI> to <HI>nature,</HI> to <HI>sight,</HI> to <HI>sense,</HI> to <HI>reason,</HI> to <HI>religion,</HI> we haue little <HI>reason</HI> to receiue it, as <HI>a truth of Christ, or a principle of Christianitie,</HI> great <HI>reason</HI> to reiect it, as <HI>a figment of a mans braine,</HI> yea as <HI>a doctrine of the diuell,</HI> inuented to wrong <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Christianitie.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Secondly, pag. 5. he citeth an authoritie out of</HI> Pope Ge∣lasius <HI>written by a farre different Author of that name Bi∣shop of</HI> Caesarea <HI>in</HI> Palestine <HI>mentioned together with his workes by</HI> Photius Bibliotheca sua Codice 102.</P>

<P><HI>Fourthly, hauing traced him throughout his whole Trea∣tise, I finde him to be a meere collector out of other Authors: and for his best Arguments be hath stolne</HI> Bellarmines <HI>obie∣ctions against our doctrine, craftily dissembling his full and solide solutions of them in those very places: which is the v∣suall trade of such Protestant petie writers. His proofes are tedious, superficiall, and stuffed with impertinent allegations, maimedly and corruptly produced: with a very bad hand (which I suppose is his owne) he inserteth many notes wholy idle and impertinent to his purpose; as I haue in reading his papers particularly obserued: which is to me an euident signe, that he hoped his papers should neuer come to the view of o∣ther then Ladies and vnlearned pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> vnable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> exam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> them.</HI></P>

<P>This as I haue heretofore by experience found to be the common practise of <HI>Popish companions;</HI> so this <HI>Defen∣dant</HI> loath to degenerate from the kinde he commeth of, at the first dash beginneth with, charging the <HI>Diuine</HI> he dealeth with to be <HI>one vtterly ignorant, vnacquainted with the Authors workes that he citeth, a petty-writer, a meere collector, a false filcher, a foule corrupter, a superficiall dispu∣ter,</HI> and what not?</P>
<P>This is his charge: Let vs heare how he prooueth it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He tearmeth Iansenius, whom he citeth, more then once a Iesuite, when he is not.</HI> It is true indeede: I con∣fesse, I doe twise so tearme him, and I tooke him to haue beene so: wherein if I were mistaken, the matter is not great. I hope the authoritie of <HI>a famous Bishop,</HI> and <HI>a great writer</HI> of speciall note among them, our of a worke of his <HI>written</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Magna eru∣ditione, ac iu∣dicio maturo Scriptum.

<P>As for the idle tale hee telleth of the <HI>Bellarmines</HI> and <HI>Bellamies,</HI> which a <HI>Minister</HI> forsooth should take the one for the other, and therupon affirme <HI>Card. Bellarmine to haue beene borne at Harrow on the Hill;</HI> it may well be thought to haue beene brought in for no other end (be∣ing so little to the purpose) but to let vs vnderstand that hee is <HI>a man of some worth;</HI> for so much hee intimateth when he saith, <HI>it was averred to himselfe and other worthy persons.</HI> Hee doubteth (belike) that his <HI>worke</HI> would scarce make his <HI>worth</HI> knowne, if hee should not other∣wise acquaint vs with it. The thing it selfe is like enough to be but a meere fiction; and might easily be requited with the tale of <HI>the Frier,</HI> that <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Marnix Beehiue.</NOTE> tooke <HI>Messias</HI> for the

<P>But, <HI>had I ever seene the first leafe of his booke, I might haue knowne him to be a Bishop of Flanders and no Iesuite.</HI> As if as oft as one either readeth or alleadgeth any <HI>Au∣thor,</HI> hee must needes turne alwayes to the <HI>title-page,</HI> to see what his style is: or as if <HI>Iansenius</HI> might not as well be <HI>Bishop of Gaunt,</HI> as <HI>Bellarmine a Cardinall,</HI> and (if I mistake not) <HI>Arch-bishop of Capua,</HI> and yet for all that <HI>a Iesuite.</HI> His proofe therefore of my being <HI>vnacquainted with this Author,</HI> (whom, I suppose, hee will finde mee better acquainted with then he would) is very silly and slight: and the exception such, as sheweth that hee wan∣ted matter of moment to except against.</P>
<P>But I hope when this <HI>Bishop of Flanders booke</HI> com∣meth to be reprinted againe, they will take that course with him, (if they haue not leaft their old guise) that they haue done formerly with many others; to wipe out of him whatsoeuer in this kinde or any other, either maketh directly against them, or discouereth the weakenesse of such grounds as they labour to build their grosse errors vpon.

As if it were a good proofe of what he auerreth, or a sufficient resutation of what he findeth obiected, to say, that <HI>Bellarmine hath largely prooued the one,</HI> or <HI>Bellarmine hath sufficiently an∣swered</HI> the other. Which if he haue done either, he hath done more by much then he oft attempteth once to doe. And surely his manner of dealing, beside the slightnesse and slendernesse of his <HI>Answeres, with a wet finger</HI> (as we say) passing by the manifold <HI>allegations</HI> produced as well out of the <HI>Auncients,</HI> as out of their owne <HI>Authors,</HI> doth giue a shrewd suspition, that he thought this his writing would neuer be examined by any either learned or vnlearned, vnlesse they were such as wanted euen common sense, sufficient to discouer the absurditie of di∣uers <HI>passages</HI> therein.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Ambrose</HI> is alleadged out of his bookes <HI>de Myste∣rijs,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>de Sacramentis:</HI> which bookes, howsoeuer <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Vide Rob.

For <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">In cap. 11. ad Cor. 1.</NOTE> Christ <HI>(saith hee)</HI> is no decei∣uer to delude vs with bare <HI>figures,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>According to which doctrine of</HI> Caluine <HI>it will be easie for my Adversarie himselfe to salue many of his owne obiections: that for exam∣ple, which he maketh out of</HI> Tertullian, <HI>page 3. saying,</HI> The bread which Christ tooke and distributed to his Disci∣ples he made his body, saying, <HI>This is my body,</HI> that is, a figure of my body. <HI>For as</HI> Caluines <HI>former words import, so also</HI> Tertullian <HI>meaneth, the sacramentall symbols not to be naked signes of Christs absent body and blood (as the Mi∣nister would haue them) but such signes as haue the signified substance conioyned vnto them; as smoake is the signe of fire; warme blood of life; the fiery tongues ouer the Apostles, in that day of Pentecost, and the Doue ouer our Sauiour in his Baptisme, were signes of the holy Ghost present, &amp;c. Which manner of being signes of Christs body and blood doth not ex∣clude but suppose the Accidents of bread and wine to containe the true substances of our Sauiours body and blood in them. So is</HI> Saint Augustine <HI>to be vnderstood, where he saith,</HI> Our Lord doubted not to say, <HI>This is my body,</HI> when hee de∣liuered
<PB N="73" REF="42"/>
the signe of his body. <HI>And when out of</HI> Gratian <HI>my Aduersary citeth those wordes,</HI> The heauenly bread, which is the flesh of Christ, &amp;c. is a Sacrament of Christs body visible, palpable, mortal, and pierced on the Crosse, &amp;c. <HI>So when</HI> Theodoret <HI>and</HI> Gelasius <HI>affirme</HI> the sub∣stance and nature of bread and wine still to remaine in the Sacrament; <HI>they meane</HI> not physicall substances and nature of bread and wine <HI>still to remaine after the consecra∣tion,</HI> but onely the accidents <HI>to remaine vnaltered in their nature, signifying and containing our Sauiours body and blood vnder them. And if hee had cited the place of</HI> Theodoret <HI>fully out, he had vtterly ouerthrowne his hereticall and frau∣dulent purposes of citing him. His wordes are these:</HI> Nei∣ther do the sacramentall signes after consecration depart from their nature; for they remaine <HI>(note how hee spea∣keth of</HI> the signes <HI>not of</HI> the substances <HI>of bread and wine re∣maining)</HI> in their former substance figure and forme to be seene and touched as before: but they are by our vn∣derstanding conceiued to be as they are made; and they are beleeued and adored according to our faith of them. <HI>So iudicious and learned is mine Aduersarie here and in other places, in the choise of his Arguments and Authorities al∣leadged against vs. But howsoeuer he faileth in that, he will be sure to helpe out the matter by maiming and corruptly ci∣ting such testimonies. I haue iust cause to suspect his like dea∣ling in citing</HI> Gratians Glosse <HI>on</HI> S. Augustines <HI>wordes in the precedent page, and</HI> Caietans <HI>words cited by him page 2. But I haue not these Authors now by me to examine the pla∣ces in themselues.

IN the next place therefore, skipping ouer this <HI>Confessi∣on</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

<P>And first, because hee thought hee had found out a pretty quirk and a strange crotchet, which hee was desi∣rous to vent: He saith <HI>I make a great stirre in asking, how the Chalice may bee called the New Testament in Christs blood.</HI> I halfe suspect that some body hath sometime pus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed him with this <HI>Question;</HI> and he is willing therfore here to explicate it for the saluing of his owne credit, the rather hauing lighted vpon a new deuice, that hee thin∣keth wil easily helpe out.

1. Hee falleth into <HI>an Inuectiue</HI> against our <HI>Protestan∣ticall Communion,</HI> as acknowledged by me <HI>to haue nothing holy, heauenly and diuinely</HI> (for so it pleaseth him to speak) <HI>therein contained, but bare bread and wine, &amp;c.</HI> adding with∣all, that <HI>neuer C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ietan, neuer Bellarmine, neuer Gratian, neuer Father or other Catholique Diuine beleeued or taught this sacrilegious doctrine</HI> (a lye he meaneth, of his owne forging) <HI>as my Aduersarie in these wordes,</HI> They, <HI>and</HI> wee, <HI>falsly pretendeth.</HI></P>
<P>In which wordes first (for hee cannot forbeare f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsify∣ing for his life, no not then and there where he chargeth others with falshood) he intimateth that in those words, <HI>Thus they;</HI> I should haue reference to <HI>Caietan, Bellarmine,</HI> and <HI>Gratian:</HI> whereas my wordes euidently point at <HI>Gelasius</HI> and <HI>Theodoret,</HI> whose owne wordes in precise tearmes I had next before cited.</P>
<P N="2">2. He chargeth me falsely to say that of the <HI>Eucharish,</HI> that neither I, nor any of our <HI>Diuines</HI> euer said: yea which being by way of <HI>Obiection</HI> before produced, I not onely disauow and disprooue, approouing freely and at large proouing the contrary; but in this place in plaine tearmes conclude the direct contrary vnto in the very wordes by him fowly falfified.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hee runneth out (to giue vs some taste of his <HI>row∣ling Rhetoricke</HI> as well as his <HI>loose Logicke)</HI> into a solemn <HI>inuocation</HI> of his forged <HI>S.

<P>Thus hee hath nibled here and there, cauilled at by∣matters, coined lies, forged and faced; but giuen no di∣rect <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Argument,</HI> whereunto hee should haue answered, and whereby it was prooued that <HI>these wordes of our Sauiour,</HI> This my body, <HI>may well beare a fi∣guratiue

<P>§ 3.

the Sacrifice and distribution of the Sacrament as it is now celebrated by vs, telleth Antoninus the Emperour that they did therein eate bread and drinke wine conuerted by the mi∣raculous force of Christs words into his naturall flesh and blood.</HI> Now heare <HI>Justines</HI> owne words: Hauing spoken before of <HI>Baptisme: After this</HI> (saith he) <HI>is there bread and a cup of water and wine presented to the Prelate of the brethren: Who receiuing the same sendeth vp praise and glo∣ry to the Father of all, by the name of the Sonne and the holy Ghost; and at large giueth thankes to him for being vouch∣safed to be by him reputed worthy of these things.

<P><HI>NEither can euer the Minister prooue his ensuing Asser∣tion, that Christs corporall presence in the thing eaten must necessarily inferre and enforce a corporall and carnall manner of eating him, vnlesse his bodie had therein a corpo∣rall extensiue and sensible manner of existing; which is by no Catholike Author affirmed; and so no hainous and vnseeme∣ly thing is in such a manner of receiuing Christs body commit∣ted: For auoiding whereof we should be enforced to runne to a figuratiue interpretation of our Sauiours speeches,</HI> Ioh. 6. <HI>So as to exclude the reall receiuing of our Sauiours flesh and blood in the Sacrament; as out of an obscure place of</HI> S.

<PB N="115" REF="63"/>
profitably to lay vp in our memories that his flesh was wounded for vs, <HI>as</HI> S. Austin <HI>in that place affirmeth. Whose</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Vide apud Bellarm. l. 2. de Euchar.</NOTE> <HI>plaine places for the reall receiuing of our Sauiours body and blood in the Sacrament my superficiall Aduersarie taketh no notice of, but as Eeles loue rather to hide themselues in durt then to swim in cleere waters; so are hee and his companions glad to hide themselues and their hereticall nouelties, in darke and obscure places of the holy Fathers, not regarding their pregnant and plaine testimonies for vs, and against them, vn∣answerably in other places expressed.</HI></P>
<P>§ 3. AT length he pleaseth to recollect himselfe and <NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

<P>To passe by these <HI>mysticall and metaphysicall tearmes,</HI> wherewith he and his <HI>Associates</HI> are wont to enwrap and inuolue themselues, <HI>like Eeles in mire and mud</HI> (as himselfe speaketh) that their absurd and senselesse <HI>doctrines,</HI> or <HI>do∣tages</HI> rather, may not be discerned; nor to insist vpon the <HI>implication</HI> of <HI>contradiction,</HI> when he saith that <HI>Christs bo∣dy</HI> is <HI>corporally,</HI> that is, <HI>bodily present</HI> in the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> and yet hath there <HI>no corporall,</HI> that is, <HI>bodily existence: a bodie bodily present,</HI> and yet <HI>not bodily existing;</HI> like the <HI>Marcio∣nites riddles</HI> in <HI>Tertullian; A man no man; Flesh no flesh;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">r Vide Ter∣tull. de carn.

<P N="1">1. If the one doe not follow vpon the other, <HI>Pope Nicholas</HI> was much to blame, when he inferred thereup∣on that <HI>Christs very body</HI> was <HI>sensually</HI> (that is as much, if not more then <HI>corporally) chewed and eaten in the Eucha∣rist.</HI></P>

2. If it be true that <HI>Bellarmine</HI> telleth vs, that <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Carnaliter in nobis ma∣nere per Eu∣charistiam, Bellarm. de Euchar. l. 2. c. 12.</NOTE> <HI>by the Eucharist Christ remaineth carnally in vs:</HI> which he citeth also, but with a foule hand, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Per Eucha∣ristiam.</NOTE> some of his owne words foisted in, as a saying of <HI>S. Hilaries:</HI> then sure he must needs <HI>carnally</HI> be eaten of vs. And to see how <HI>inconstant error</HI> is, and how contrary to it selfe: one while he saith that there is <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Manducatio corporalis. Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>a corporall eating of Christs body in the Sacra∣ment;</HI> as their common <HI>tenent</HI> is: (and how is he not then <HI>corporaelly eaten?)</HI> and that <HI>Christ carnally thereby abideth in vs:</HI> And yet againe another while; out of <HI>Athanasius,</HI> that <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Manduca∣tionem cor∣poris Christi non debere carnaliter ac∣cipi.

<P>In a word; 1. Either <HI>Bread</HI> or <HI>Christs body</HI> must needs be <HI>corporally eaten</HI> in the <HI>Eucharist:</HI> but not <HI>bread,</HI> if we beleeue them; for there is none there: and to say that <HI>meere accidents</HI> onely are chewed and fed vpon is most senselesse and absurd: It remaineth therefore that <HI>Christs body,</HI> if that alone be there, be <HI>corporally eaten</HI> there, as <HI>Pope Nicholas</HI> before affirmed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Either <HI>Christs flesh is eaten</HI> there <HI>corporally,</HI> or <HI>spiri∣tually</HI> onely. If <HI>corporally,</HI> why doth this fellow sticke at it, and is so loath to acknowledge it? If <HI>spiritually</HI> one∣ly, why vrge they those passages of <HI>Iohn</HI> 6. to prooue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>corporall and bodily manducation of Christs body in the Eu∣charist?</HI> And so come we to examine that <HI>place</HI> by them so much and so oft vrged to prooue such <HI>a carnall eating of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>§ 4. Here this <HI>profound and learned Doctor</HI> telleth vs, that <HI>his superficiall Aduersarie hath in an vnlearned and slender manner endeauoured to prooue that our Sauiours dis∣course there is not to be vnderstood of Sacramentall Mandu∣cation, but of spirituall eating his flesh and blood by beleeuing in him.</HI></P>
<P>I propound two <HI>Propositions</HI> to be prooued.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the words are not to be vnderstood of any such corporall eating and drinking,</HI> as they hold.</P>
<P N="2">2. That <HI>Christ doth not in that whole discourse speake of
<PB N="117" REF="64"/>
the Sacrament of the Eucharist,</HI> which was not as yet in∣stituted, but of such <HI>spirituall feeding on Christ,</HI> as is per∣formed, not <HI>in the Sacrament</HI> onely, but <HI>out of it</HI> also.</P>
<P>The former I prooue by a plaine place of <HI>S. Augu∣stine;</HI> which this <HI>Aduersarie,</HI> referring vs still for an <HI>an∣swer</HI> to <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> (from whom he borroweth the most that he hath) saith is <HI>an obscure place,</HI> and is pleased a little after to tearme it no better then <HI>durt,</HI> which wee <HI>Protestants,</HI> like <HI>Eeles,</HI> desire to hide our selues in.</P>
<P N="1">1. Were it not an absurd thing for <HI>Augustine</HI> to speake <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bscurely</HI> there, where he giueth <HI>rules</HI> for the opening and right vnderstanding of <HI>places obscure?</HI> where should he speake more plainely and perspicuously then there; where his maine aime is to make things cleere?</P>
<P N="2">2. This <HI>shifters answer</HI> borrowed from <HI>Bellarmine</HI> is but <HI>a bare shift;</HI> to wit, that <HI>the place prooueth no more, but that our Sauiours speech concerning the eating of his flesh and drinking of his blood is figuratiue so far forth, as that his flesh was not carnally to be eaten, and in a bloody manner, as flesh sold in the shambles is wont to be eaten,</HI> &amp;c. As if <HI>flesh bought in the shambles</HI> vsed to be eaten raw and <HI>in bloody manner.</HI> Here is a deale of <HI>durt</HI> indeede and <HI>mud</HI> raised to trouble <HI>Augustines cleere water.</HI> The <HI>Question</HI> is whether our Sa∣uiours words be to be vnderstood <HI>properly</HI> or <HI>figuratiuely.</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Non pos∣sunt figuratè accipi sed propriè.

It is no such eating of <HI>Christs body</HI> therefore, as they imagine to be in the <HI>Eucharist.</HI> Yea so contrary to them, and so pregnant for vs is that passage of <HI>Augustine,</HI> that in <HI>Fulbertus</HI> his workes, where those words of his are related, they haue with a foule in∣sertion branded them for <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Facinus vel flagitium vi∣detur iubere.

<HI>of Christ; which my superficiall Aduersarie taketh no notice of. Bellarmine</HI> is still much in this mans mouth; and the <HI>superficialnesse</HI> of his silly and <HI>vnlearned Aduersarie.</HI> But this (I am sure) <HI>is a very vnlearned, slender and super∣ficiall proofe</HI> of points questioned, to turne his <HI>Reader</HI> o∣uer still for satisfaction to some other. Yet I will doe him the couttesie, since he telleth vs of other <HI>plaine places</HI> in <HI>Augustine</HI> to present him with one of them, though such an one (it may be) as will not easily goe downe with him. <HI>Augustine</HI> speaking of this place in <HI>Iohn</HI> on <HI>Psal.</HI> 98. saith that <HI>Christ</HI> hauing vsed those words, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ioh 6. 35.</NOTE> <HI>Vnlesse you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man and drinke his blood, you haue no life in you.</HI> When some vnderstood them <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Stultè car∣naliter.</NOTE> <HI>foolish∣ly and carnally,</HI> he taught them to vnderstand them <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Spiritaliter intelligere.</NOTE> <HI>spiri∣tually;</HI> saying, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6. 63.</NOTE> <HI>It is the Spirit that quickneth; the flesh pro∣fiteth nothing: the words that I speake are Spirit and life.</HI> As if he should haue said; <HI>vnderstand you spiritually what I haue spoken.</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Non hoc corpus quod videtis man∣ducatur, iestis &amp; bibituri il∣lum sanguinē quem fusuri sunt qui me crucifigent.</NOTE> <HI>You are not to eate that body which you see, and to drinke that blood which they will shed that shall cruci∣fie me.</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Sacramen∣tum aliquod vobis com∣mendaui: spi∣ritualiter in∣tellectum vi∣uificabit vos.

<PB N="119" REF="65"/>
all mention of the Sacrament in our Sauiours last Supper, be∣cause he had in the 6. Chap. of his Gospell so particularly ex∣pressed the promised excellency and heauenly fruits thereof: and many euident and vnanswerable Arguments are by Ca∣tholike expositors of that Chapter made to prooue the same; which with silence my Aduersarie ouerpasseth. First, (for example) our Sauiour from the 31. to the 60. verse of that Chapter maketh a difference betwixt the gift which his Fa∣ther had giuen to the Iewes louing the world so as to giue his onely begotten Sonne for it, and the gift which himselfe meant to giue to them, speaking of the one as a gift already past; but of the other as of a gift afterwards to bee giuen vnto them. Secondly, He compareth the eating of his flesh to the Israelites eating of Manna in the desert; which was a cor∣porall food really eaten by them. Thirdly, If by eating his flesh and drinking his blood our Sauiour meant no other thing then that they should beleeue in him, it had beene a strange course in him, who so thirsted after the saluation of soules by an ob∣scure manner of speaking to driue away so many, such persons especially as had formerly followed him, without any word added, which might open this obscure doctrine vnto them; as</HI> Card. Tollet <HI>excellently relateth there the whole processe of our Sauiours doctrine.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="127" REF="69"/>
<HI>MY Aduersaries Arguments to the contrary are meerely</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">N. P.</NOTE> <HI>topicall, and prooue nothing. For first it is false, that the faithfull Iewes before Christ did sacramentally receiue our Sauiour as well as we: which hee barely affirmeth and prooueth not, page 7.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, those words of Christ,</HI> Except yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of Man and drinke his blood, you shall not haue life in you; <HI>was a precept respectiuely giuen and onely obliging such persons to an actuall receiuing of the Sa∣crament as they were to whom it was vttred; such persons (to wit) as are by age capable of Sacramentall manducation. And surely if Christs words be onely vnderstood, as my Ad∣uersarie would haue them, of spirituall eating Christ by faith, they must necessarily import a precept more impossible to be fulfilled by children then sacramentally to receiue him. For sooner may children receiue the Sacrament, especially drinke of the consecrated Chalice (as anciently in the Greeke and Latine Churches they were went to doe) then actually beleeue in him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His next Argument pag. 8. maketh more (if this Mini∣ster had wit to discerne the force thereof) against his owne exposition of Christs words, then it doth against our vnder∣standing of them. For as all that receiue Sacramentally Christs flesh and blood, are not saued; no more are all that spiritually and by faith eate him. This being sufficient for the veritie of our Sauiours speeches that the Sacrament is ordai∣ned to produce those excellent and heauenly effects which Christs promises there import in the soules of such as worthi∣ly receiue it; and such centrarily as come vnworthily there∣unto receiue death and iudgement to themselues by it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As for those few Catholike writers who haue denied Christs words in that 6. Chap. of</HI> Saint Iohn <HI>to haue beene vnderstood at all of Sacramentall manducation; I answer, that their number is not great, and their authoritie of no weight at all against a numberlesse multitude of ancient Fa∣thers and moderne Doctors of better note contrarily vnder∣standing them; yeelding better reasons for that their literall
<PB N="128" REF="70"/>
true explication, and easily soluing all hereticall Obiections gathered from the literall sense of our Sauiours words in that Chapter against our communion vnder one kinde and other points of Catholike doctrine. And sithence my Aduersaerie will not sticke to contemne these very Authors in their other knowne Catholike doctrines, why doth he so highly value and mainely vrge them in this opinion, wherein without any here∣ticall intention or obstinacie of Iudgement they differ from vs?</HI></P>
<P>§ 6. AT length he commeth to refute mine <HI>Argu∣ments;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. G.</NOTE> which he saith are <HI>topicall,</HI> and <HI>prooue nothing.</HI></P>
<P>My first <HI>Argument</HI> is this:</P>
<P><HI>None are saued but such as so feede on Christ,</HI> as is there spoken of. <HI>But many are saued that neuer fed on Christ in the Eucharist;</HI> as <HI>the Fathers before Christ; the children of the faithfull that die infants,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ergò it is not spoken of the Eucharist.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1.

<P>Not to runne out into more <HI>Questions</HI> then needs must at the present, I answer:</P>
<P N="1">1. Many yong ones die, though at yeeres of discreti∣on, when in ordinary course they may well haue <HI>faith,</HI> and beleeue actually, yet ere they be admitted to the <HI>Eucharist:</HI> and yet is not their <HI>saluation</HI> at all thereby preindiced.</P>

<P><HI>But many feede on the Eucharist that are eternally dam∣ned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergò Christ speaketh not there of orall eating in the Eu∣charist.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>this Argument</HI> (saith he) <HI>if I had wit to discerne the force of it, maketh more against vs then against them.</HI> And why so? Forsooth, <HI>because all are not saued that spi∣ritually and by faith feede on Christ.</HI> This is like <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llarmines</HI> bold assertion, that <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Aliquos cre∣dentes in Christum in aeternum pe∣rire, quod ante morian∣tur, quam à Sacerdote ab∣solui potue∣rint.

<P>Nor is it <HI>sufficient</HI> (as he addeth) <HI>for to verifie our Saui∣ours speeches that the Sacrament is ordained to produce such effects in the Soules of such as worthily receiue it, though the contrary befall those that doe vnworthily rēceiue it.</HI> For (to answer them againe in the words of one of their owne <HI>Authors)</HI> our Sauiours words imply manifestly <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Manducati∣onis &amp; potus certum effe∣ctum.

<P N="1">1. <HI>The little force of this Argument</HI> (hee saith) <HI>I can∣not be so ignorant as not to conceiue: because</HI> Aarons <HI>rod af∣ter it was conuerted into a Serpent, and retained not the es∣sence or figure of a rod, yet was notwithstanding so called, &amp;c.</HI> And hee cannot bee so ignorant as not to conceiue that this very <HI>Obiection</HI> is there by me propounded and answe∣red: yea, and that <HI>Bellarmine</HI> himselfe reiecteth it as <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Haec solutio non videtur solidissima.

<P N="2">2. He saith that <HI>the accidents of bread and wine remai∣ning retaine still their old names.</HI> To what purpose?

one would beleeue whatsoeuer he said, though he neuer assaied to shew it) <HI>since I make Bellarmine himselfe speake like a Protestant.</HI> No: I make him speake nothing but what <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">De Euchar. lib. 1. cap. 1.</NOTE> hee saith of himselfe: and by his owne <HI>graunts</HI> prooue that either the auncient <HI>Fathers</HI> spake <HI>very ab∣surdly,</HI> or else they ment as we meane. The <HI>Argument</HI> is this:
<Q><P>The ancients Fathers say oft, that the Bread in the Eu∣charist is Christs body.</P>
<P>But this saying <HI>(saith</HI> Bellarmine,) <HI>This bread is my body,</HI> must either be taken figuratiuely, or else it is ab∣surd and impossible.</P>
<P>The Fathers therfore when they vsed such speeches, shew∣ed euidently thereby that they ment as we meane, <HI>(that is,</HI> they vnderstood Christs words figuratiuely) or else <HI>(by</HI> Bellarmines <HI>confession)</HI> they spake very absurdly.</P></Q></P>
<P>Nor is it enough to prooue that <HI>I corrupt Bellarmine,</HI> to say that <HI>he disputeth in that place against Luther, who taught that bread remained still in the Sacrament:</HI> For what is that to the purpose? much lesse to say vntruly, that <HI>he spake not of bread consecrated;</HI> when the very <HI>Question</HI> is there concerning the <HI>consecrated bread.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>I cite Authors</HI> (he saith) <HI>that I vnderstand not.</HI> It is true indeede; In this very place I cite some sayings of <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> that neither I, nor any such <HI>dull-heads</HI> as I am (I thinke) can easily vnderstand; as for example, where <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">De Euchar. l 3. c. 24.</NOTE> he saith, as I here cite him, that <HI>The Priest maketh Christs body of bread;</HI> and yet <HI>Christs body is not made by the Priest:</HI> And againe, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> that <HI>the body of Christ that was crucified, was truly or verily made of Bread:</HI> And yet con∣futing <HI>Rupertus</HI> he saith else-where, that <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">De Euchar. l. 3. c. 11.</NOTE> <HI>it was not a breaden body that was crucified for vs;</HI> as <HI>Tertullian</HI> infer∣red from the doctrine of the <HI>Marci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nites;</HI> and as we may well inferre from theirs.

<PB N="147" REF="79"/>
any <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> will afford. And this deepe <HI>Metaphy∣sicall Doctor,</HI> that hath no want of wit, and vnderstandeth him so well, should haue done well to vnfold to vs these <HI>mysteries,</HI> and arreade vs these <HI>riddles:</HI> whereas he very vncharitably passeth them by, and onely controlling vs for our <HI>ignorance,</HI> leaueth vs sticking still in the bryers with them, not vouchsafing to helpe vs out.</P>
<P><HI>PAg. 12. He affirmeth it to be most absurd to affirme, as</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">N.

The difference betwixt Trans∣substantiation in the Sacrament, and other substantiall natu∣rall conuersions chiefely consisting in this, that the whole sub∣stance of bread passeth into another praeexisting substance, Christs body, to wit, introduced in place thereof, so as nothing thereof remaineth; whereas in them the same matter, albeit receiuing a new forme and so made a distinct substance from what it was before, still remaineth: which is to the Mini∣sters purpose wholly impertinent, vnlesse hee will falsely and foolishly withall affirme that God can destroy no substance in∣tirely leauing the Accidents thereof still remaining, to intro∣duce an other substance in place thereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And albeit we cannot say of Christs body, that it was bread, (which is another Argument of the Minister, ibidem) yet may it be said to haue beene of bread, as being by the same mi∣raculous and omnipotent power of Christs words, whereby bread looseth naturall being in place thereof Sacramentally produced and made present. And this is without any difficultie affirmed by vs, who know the same in a propertionable man∣ner to be found in all other substantiall and accident all conuer∣sions, howsoeuer his poore Iudgement will not serue to consider it: heate (for example) was neuer cold, albeit in place there∣of produced; fire was neuer wood, but as a substance (as na∣turall

<P>Now 1. what is this to mine <HI>Argument?</HI> was this man (thinke we) euer <HI>a disputant,</HI> that answereth <HI>Arguments</HI> on this wise? which part of my <HI>Syllogisme</HI> (I pray you) is this <HI>Answer</HI> applied to? I had thought that a <HI>Syllo∣gisme</HI> being propounded, the <HI>Answerer</HI> should either haue <HI>denied</HI> or <HI>distinguished</HI> of one of the former <HI>Propo∣sitions.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is not true, that <HI>the bread and wine</HI> in the <HI>Sacra∣ment</HI> are <HI>signes</HI> of these things. Some <HI>affections</HI> of them and <HI>Actions</HI> vsed about them indeede are. The <HI>bread and wine</HI> themselues are <HI>signes</HI> of <HI>spirituall nutriment,</HI> not <HI>nutrition.</HI> The <HI>eating and drinking</HI> is a signe of it. <HI>Signes</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="86"/>
they are of <HI>Christs body and blood;</HI> not of the <HI>dolorous se∣uering</HI> of them in the <HI>passion,</HI> though their being apart is a <HI>signe</HI> of it also.</P>
<P N="3">3. He saith that <HI>a thing in one manner considered may be a Signe of it selfe in another manner considered: as Christ transfigured of himselfe now in heauen glorified; his trium∣phant entrance into Ierusalem of his triumphant entrance into heauen; and an Emperour in his triumph may represent his owne victorie.</HI></P>
<P>But 1. If <HI>signum &amp; res signata, the Signe and the thing signified</HI> by it be <HI>relatiues</HI> (as without all Question they are) a <HI>Father</HI> may as well be <HI>a father</HI> to himselfe, as a <HI>signe</HI> may be the <HI>signe</HI> of it selfe. Not to adde that the <HI>Anci∣ents</HI> (as hath formerly beene shewen) are wont to call the <HI>Sacraments pictures,</HI> and <HI>pledges:</HI> and it is against com∣mon sense to say that ought is either a <HI>picture,</HI> or a <HI>pledge</HI> of it selfe.</P>
<P N="2">2. I might well put this <HI>Defendant</HI> to prooue that <HI>Christs transfiguration</HI> was a <HI>representation of his present</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">a Math. 17. 24</NOTE> <HI>glorification,</HI> or that <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Math. 21. 7-10.</NOTE> his <HI>entrance into Ierusalem</HI> was <HI>a type of his glorious entrance into heauen,</HI> whatsoeuer his bastard∣ly <HI>Eusebius Emissenus</HI> say of it; whose <HI>authoritie</HI> is no bet∣ter then his owne.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let him haue what he would; that the one was a <HI>type</HI> of the other: Doth it follow; <HI>Christs transfiguration was a type of his glorification: therefore Christ was a type or a signe of himselfe?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>An Emperour</HI> and his <HI>victorie</HI> (I suppose) are not all one; no more then <HI>Christs body</HI> and the <HI>glorification</HI> of it; nor againe the <HI>transfiguration,</HI> &amp; the present <HI>glorification.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Argument</HI> therefore is neither <HI>idle</HI> nor <HI>forceless<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for ought that he hath yet shewed.</P>

<P><HI>MY Aduersaries next Argument from the qualitie of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">N. P.</NOTE> <HI>the Communicants, page 18. is this; If Christs body be really and corporally present in the Eucharist, then all that eate thereof must of necessity eate Christ in it. But many eate of the Eucharist, that yet eate not Christ in it: for none but faithfull and liuely members of Christ eate him in this Sa∣crament. In which Argument hee endeavoureth to prooue one falshood by another, equally by vs denyed; because the ho∣ly Fathers expressely affirme that</HI> Iudas <HI>and the Corinthians blamed by</HI> Saint Paul <HI>receiued, albeit vnworthily, and to damnation, the body of Christ, as the Apostles words</HI> 1 Cor. 11. <HI>euidently import; and when</HI> S. Augustine <HI>and others seemed to deny them to receiue Christ in the Sacrament, they speake not of bare sacramentall, but of profitable and fruitfull receiuing of him.</HI></P>
<P>MY sixt <HI>Reason</HI> is taken from <HI>the qualitie of the Com∣municants.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">T. G.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Argument</HI> is briefly this;</P>
<P>Many eate of the Eucharist, that eate not Christ in it:</P>
<P>Ergò Christ is not corporally in it:</P>
<P>The <HI>Antecedent</HI> is thus prooued:</P>
<P>None feed on Christ but the faithfull; such as be in Christ, and liue by Christ:</P>
<P>But many eate of the Eucharist that are vnfaithfull, and are out of Christ: Ergò, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Proposition</HI> of this latter <HI>Syllogisme</HI> he denyeth, and saith it is a meere <HI>falshood:</HI> and why so? forsooth <HI>they deny it themselues.</HI> And why doe they so? because <HI>the holy Fathers say that Iudas and the Corinthians blamed by S. Paul, did receiue Christs body, as the Apostles words evi∣dently import.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="188" REF="100"/>
1. For <HI>the Apostle,</HI> he saith expresly, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 27.</NOTE> <HI>He that eateth this bread:</HI> as plainely as can bee telling vs more then once or twice, that it was <HI>bread</HI> that they did eat, though tearmed also <HI>Christs body</HI> (as hath oft beene said, and as <HI>Augustine</HI> sheweth) because <HI>a Sacrament</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is not this shamelesse dealing to say <HI>the Fathers af∣firme that Iudas receiued Christs naturall body</HI> (for of that is the question) yet not alleadging any one tittle out of any of them for the proofe of it? and that when the say∣ing of one them is produced directly to the cōtrary, that <HI>Iudas ate Christs bread, but not the bread Christ;</HI> which he answereth not a word to. If they say that <HI>Iudas ate with the rest Christs body;</HI> they expound themselues what thereby they meane, to wit, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Panis Chri∣sti datus est Iudae. Aug. in Ioan. tr. 62.</NOTE> <HI>Christs bread,</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Tunc Iudas Christi cor∣pus accepit, quando om∣nibus eis di∣stribuit Sacra∣mentum cor∣poris &amp; san∣guinissui, vbi &amp; ipse Iudas erat Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>the Sacra∣ment of his body.</HI></P>
<P>§ 2. Yea but <HI>the Fathers, when they deny wicked men to rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christ in the Sacrament, they speake not of bare sacramentall, but of profitable and fruitfull receiuing of him.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is true indeed, they speake not of bare <HI>sacramentall eating.</HI> And who saith they do? Or what is this tothe pur∣pose? what is it but that I say? They speake not of <HI>bare sacrametall eating,</HI> when they say, <HI>wickedmen eat not Christ in the Eucharist,</HI> but they speake of it, when they say <HI>they do eat</HI> yet <HI>of the Eucharist;</HI> wherein they should <HI>eat Christ,</HI> were <HI>Christ corporally</HI> in it, which they say they doe not.</P>
<P N="2">2. They say (you haue their owne wordes) that <HI>it is not possible for any wicked man to eate Christs flesh and drinke his blood, albeit they doe gnaw or chew the Sacrament with their teeth: because our Saviour saith;</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6 56.</NOTE> Whosoeuer eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, abideth in mee; and <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6. 51.</NOTE> whosoeuer eateth of this bread shall liue for euer.</P>
<P N="3">3. This <HI>Answer</HI> implieth that <HI>Christs body</HI> it selfe may <HI>vnfruitfully and vnprofitably be eaten:</HI> as if the ancient <HI>Fa∣thers</HI> had dreamed of <HI>a twofold eating</HI> of it, <HI>a worthy</HI> and <HI>profitable,</HI> and <HI>an vnworthie</HI> and <HI>vnprofitable</HI> eating.

<P><HI>LAstly, when pag. 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. hee argueth that Christs body cannot be in the Eucharist: first, be∣cause</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">N.

Secondly, it should be subiect to many vndecencies, as corruption, pu∣trefaction, mice-eating and other foule abuses apt to happen to the bread and wine of the Sacrament. I answer him that Christs body being in it selfe now glorious and impossible, and after a spirituall and indivisible manner present in the Sacrament, cannot be in it selfe broken or otherwise abused then Angels in assumped bodies can bee wounded, or then the Maiesty of the diuine person in Christ was by thornes torne, nayles pierced, or other torments defaced: for all such indigni∣ties and painfull alterations, were immediately onely inflicted on the corporall nature of our Sauiour defaced vtterly by them, and touched not immediately the diuine person, albeit personally therein subsisting: So all indignities and altera∣tions</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="101"/>
<HI>happening to the sacramentall signes touch not at all the body it selfe of our Sauiour impassibly and iudiuisibly vnder them, more then the maiesty it selfe of the diuine nature-pre∣sent in all creatures is defiled in fonle places, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such Arguments as these made against our Sauiours reall true presence in the Sacrament by our inconsiderate Aduersa∣ries, are like to those other Arguments wont to bee made by the Eutycheans, Nestorians, Arians, and other ancient He∣retickes, against the diuinity of our Sauiour, and personall v∣nion of two natures in him; as that it was not fit or reasona∣ble to be conceiued, that either God so vnited with man, or man deified by personall assumption should be torn with whips, thornes, and nayles, spet vpon, buffeted, and finally die in ago∣nies and torments; that fleas and flies should sucke the blood of God, bite his flesh, &amp;c. which indeed is more then can be done vnto the same, as it is here in the Sacrament, euen when mice eate the sacramentall signes, or when in our stomacks wee re∣ceiue them, or by fire wee consume them, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>wise abuse thē, Christ being not quantitatiuely and corporally with them extended, and so, not to be touched or altered by any corporall action done about them. And holy soules considering with what humility and effusion of his bounty the Son of God was pleased to institute this great Sacrament, affording therein for his glory and our great good his owne comfortable presence vnto vs, haue iust reason to cry out his mercy, and to admire his wisedome, power and goodnesse wonderfully manifested in this second exhiminition of himself, as I may iustly call this Sacramentall presence, or hiding of himselfe in this Sacra∣ment, to become thereby an heauenly food and diuine refection of soules deuontly receiuing him; as also a louing spouse visi∣ting, embracing, delighting, adorning and enriching them with his presence, daily triumphing himselfe in his victory o∣uer Sathan, and our redemption solely and abundantly pur∣chased by his passion; and making vs also to triumph with him: And whereas the Diuell once by his ministers Iewes and Gentiles, caused his blood to be separated from his body, he deuised to haue that real separation mysteriously continued

and daily exhibited to the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of his eternall Father for vs, which is</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.</NOTE> <HI>the declaring of the Lords death till he come, men∣tioned by the Apostle.</HI></P>
<P>MY last <HI>Argument</HI> is taken from those things that <NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

<P>To this he answereth;</P>
<P N="1">1. That though these things be done to or befall <HI>the Sacrament,</HI> yet <HI>Christs body being now glorious and impas∣sible, and after a spirituall and indiuisible manner present, it can no more thereby be broken and abused then Angels in as∣sumpted bodies can be wounded, or Christs Deity was woun∣ded or pierced on the Crosse.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We take what hee granteth. <HI>Christs body is now glorious and impassible:</HI> and therefore not subiect vn∣to such indignities, as these <HI>creatures</HI> are: and the one consequently is not the other. Yea, is <HI>Christs body</HI> it self <HI>impassible?</HI> What is it then, that (as <HI>Origen</HI> speaketh) <HI>go∣eth into the draught?</HI> &amp;c. which this <HI>Defendant</HI> taketh no notice of, because hee knoweth not what to say to it. Or let him resolue what those <HI>ashes,</HI> that they will to be re∣serued for <HI>reliques</HI> or what those <HI>mites</HI> are made of, that breed in the <HI>consecrated bread,</HI> when either they burne it, and so deale with it as they doe with <HI>Heretickes,</HI> or re∣serue it ouer long.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is <HI>present in a spirituall manner,</HI> Had hee but ad∣ded, <HI>onely,</HI> he had marred all: hee had beene a foule <HI>He∣reticke,</HI> and perchance might fare no better, if he would stand to his words, then this their little <HI>God almighty</HI> doth, when he groweth hoary. But is hee come to that now, <HI>Christ is spiritually in the Sacrament?</HI> What is be∣come (I maruell) of that <HI>carnall and corporall presence</HI> then, that they prate so much of? and for want whereof they so much vilifie <HI>the Protestantical Cōmunion?</HI> Or what

is the reason why hee could not endure to heare, that those wordes of our Sauiour, of <HI>eating his flesh, Iohn</HI> 6. should be <HI>spiritually</HI> vnderstood?</P>
<P N="3">3. If these things cannot befall <HI>Christs body,</HI> because it is <HI>after a spirituall manner present;</HI> then belike these things may befall it, yea must needs befall it when they doe fall out, if it be <HI>present in a carnall or corporall manner;</HI> which <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Carnaliter.

<P>In an <HI>Epistle</HI> of his written for <HI>Wulfsine</HI> then <HI>Bishop of Shyrburn</HI> to his <HI>Clerks</HI> bearing title of <HI>a Sacerdotall Sy∣node,</HI> he saith, that <HI>The holy Housell is Christs bodie, not bo∣dily, but ghostly: Not the body that he suffered in, but the body of which he spake, when hee blessed bread and wine to housell, and said by the blessed bread, This is my body; and by the holy wine, This is my blood.</HI> And that <HI>the Lord that then
<PB N="231" REF="121"/>
turned that bread to his body, doth still by the Priests hands blesse bread and wine to his ghostly body and his ghostly blood.</HI> And in another <HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Wulstane Archbishop of Yorke;</HI> that <HI>The Lord halloweth daily by the hands of the Priest, bread to his body, and wine to his blood in ghostly mystery. And yet notwithstanding that liuely bread is not bodily so, nor the selfe same body that Christ suffered in: nor that holy wine is the Sauiours blood, which was shed for vs in bodily thing, but in ghostly vnderstanding.</HI> And that <HI>that bread is his body, and that wine his blood, as the heauenly bread, which we call Manna, was his body, and the cleere water which did then run from the stone in the wildernes was truely his blood; as</HI> S. Paul <HI>saith,</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 4.</NOTE> And that stone was <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And in the <HI>Paschall Homily</HI> by him translated out of <HI>Latine,</HI> and read commonly then on <HI>Easter-day; Men</HI> (saith hee) <HI>haue often searched, and doe as yet search how bread that is gathered of corne, and through fires heat baked, may be turned to Christs body; or how wine that is pressed out of many grapes is turned through one blessing to the Lords blood.</HI> To which he there answereth, that <HI>it is so by signifi∣cation, as Christ is said to be Bread, a Rocke, a Lamb, a Li∣on, not after truth of nature.</HI> And againe hauing demanded, <HI>Why is that holy housell then called Christs body and his blood, if it be not truely that that it is called?</HI> Hee answereth, <HI>It is so truely in a ghostly mysterie.</HI> And then explicating fur∣ther the manner of this change; <HI>As</HI> (saith he) <HI>an heathen childe when hee is Christened, yet hee altereth not his shape without, though hee be changed within: and as the holy wa∣ter in Baptisme after true nature is corruptible water, but af∣ter ghostly mystery hath spirituall vertue.</HI> And so saith he; <HI>The holy Housell is naturally corruptible bread &amp; corruptible wine, but is by might of Gods word truely Christs body and blood, yet not bodily, but ghostly.</HI> And afterward hee setteth downe diuerse <HI>differences</HI> betweene <HI>Christs naturall body</HI> and it. <HI>Much is betwixt the body that Christ suffered in, and the body that he hallowed to housell: 1. The body that hee suffered in was bred of the flesh of Mary, with blood, and bone,
<PB N="232" REF="122"/>
and skin, and sinewes, in humane limmes, and a liuing Soule. His ghostly body which we call the housell, is gathered of ma∣ny cornes without blood and bone, limme and soule. And it is therefore called a mystery, because therein is one thing seen, and another thing vnderstood.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christs body that he suffred in and rose from death, ne∣uer dieth henceforth, but is eternall and impassible: That housel is temporall, not eternall, corruptible, and dealed into sundry parts, chewed betweene the teeth, and sent into the belly.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This mysterie is a pledge and figure. Christs body is truth it selfe. This pledge doe we keepe mystically, vntill we come vnto the truth it selfe, and then is this pledge ended. Truly it is, as we said Christs body and blood, not bodily, but ghostly.</HI> And yet further he addeth that, <HI>As the Stone in the wildernesse, from whence the water ran, was not bodily Christ, but did signifie Christ, though the Apostle say,</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10. 4</NOTE> That stone was Christ: <HI>so that heauenly meate that fed them 40. yeeres, and that water that gushed from the Stone, had signifi∣cation of Christs body and blood, and was the same that wee now offer, not bodily, but ghostly.</HI> And that, <HI>As Christ tur∣ned by inuisible might the bread to his body and the wine to his blood before he suffred; so he did in the wildernesse turne the heauenly meate to his flesh, and the flowing water to his owne blood, before hee was borne.</HI> That, <HI>when our Sauiour said,</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6. 54.</NOTE> Hee that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath euerlasting life; <HI>He bad them not eate the body where∣with he was enclosed, nor to drinke that blood which hee shed for vs: but he ment that holy housel, which is ghostly his body and his blood; and hee that tasteth it with beleeuing heart, hath euerlasting life.</HI> That, <HI>As the sacrifices had a sore-sig∣nification of Christs body which he offered to his Father in Sacrifice: So the housell that wee hallaw at Gods Altar is a remembrance of Christs body which he offered for vs, and of his blood which he shed for vs: which suffering once done by him is daily renewed in a mystery of holy housell.</HI> Lastly, that <HI>This holy housell is both Christs body, and the bodie of
<PB N="233" REF="122"/>
all faithfull men after ghostly mysterie: and so when we re∣ceiue it, we receiue our selues too. For,</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12. 27.</NOTE> You are Christs body <HI>saith the Apostle; and,</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 17.</NOTE> We many bee one bread, and one body.</P>
<P>Whence it is apparent that the same <HI>Faith</HI> that wee hold concerning <HI>the Sacrament of the Eucharist,</HI> and <HI>Christs presence in it</HI> was publikely taught and ordi∣narily professed in this <HI>Iland</HI> euen for a long time also af∣ter <HI>Austins</HI> accesse into these parts.
