<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Generall ought to bee tem∣perate, continent, and not excessiue in eating and drin∣king: Patient in trauaile, of witte prompt, whereby in the night time by quietnesse of minde the counsailes of Captaines examined, maie more perfectlie bee confir∣med. Hee ought to be con∣tent with simple fare: For the preparing of dishes full of delicatenesse and the too much thoughts and diligence a∣bout
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
meates, corrupteth and drowneth the minde in such sort, that the time that ought to bee spent in the businesse that is to bee done, by the delicatenesse of the Captaines is most vainely consumed. Hee ought too bee painefull, for that princiapllie it doth apperteine too a Generall that hee in the time of turmoyles of the Warre, may bee the last that is wearie. Hee must bee quicke witted, forso∣much as <HI>Homere</HI> sayth, flying to the ende: that with his thought hee maie most quicklie discusse euerie thing, and with his minde make iudgement, and as it were de∣uine a farre of and foresee that which is to come: least when there happen chaunces neyther foreseene nor looked for, the Generall be constrayned sodeinly and vnprouided for to take counsaile, and the safegarde of things to com∣mit most fearefully to fortune. It behooueth him to be li∣berall, and not to bee couetous and desirous of gayne. For surelie of this vice he ought most principally to take héede, forasmuch as he that is not giuen to passe much of giftes of Siluer and Gold, may most honorably haue the charge of such dooings, whereas those bee most wicked that will be drawne with the vnsatiablenesse of Golde, the which is such a weapon of so much might, and as it were with liue∣lie force to deliuer the weapon out of his owne handes and to giue to others. He ought to be a faire speaker, for that considering the thinges that are to be intreated of for the Warre, I iudge there will followe much vtilitie, con∣sidering that eyther hauing occasion to set men in araie to the battaile, the Generall comforting the souldiers easilie maie perswade euerie one of them to despise all perils, and to attend to the glorious enterprise. For the sound of the Trumpet cannot so much inflame the mindes of men to take their weapons; and constraine them more valiantlie to fight, then the conuenient and according to the time the sugred taske of the Generall, which maie moue them, both vnto great actes for the loue of vertue, and encourage them for the desire of glorie, or els if neede bee, to comfort
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
the mindes afflicted for some ouerthrow had, his wordes shall be a medicine. Wherefore for the benefit of the hoast and to lighten heauinesse of accidents the accommodate speaking of the Generall by most reason is more to be de∣sired then the industrie of Surgeons, which follow the Campe onelie to the ende to heale woundes, for that they take no care or charge but to heale the hurtes: but hee with sweete and curteous maner of speaking comforteth and most highlie maketh glad, the mindes of the weake and afflicted. Besides this, hee confirmeth the mindes of them that bee whole, and retaines them that bee bol∣dened, then how much more difficult it is to heale the in∣firmities that is hid, then those which maie bee both felt and seene, euerie man knoweth: and like as no Prince will erect an armie to send them without a Generall and determinate Gouernour: euen so the Generall ought not to bee chosen that knoweth not, nor hath the grace in spea∣king, and that lacketh the facilitie and vtteraunce of speache. Likewise the Generall beeing confirmed in his degree, should bee pleasant, gentle, and cheerefull too them that will come to him, gladlie and willing to recom∣pence the valiant and good, both with the liberalitie of the pursse, and dignitie of office, and with sharpe punish∣ment to punish the slouthfull, malefactors, and offendors. Also hee ought not in euerie place and too euerie man showe himselfe so benigne and gentle, least he happen to be despised, neither so proud and stoute that he moue other to beare him hatred.</P>
<P>And that hee doe this to the intent that with to much license and benignitie hee cause not the armie to bee disso∣lute, or with sharpnesse and seueritie make them alienate their mindes and beecome enimies. Likewise the libera∣litie of a Prince or Generall although it bee but little: if with benignitie liberallie at time conuenient it bee vsed, it maie get most greate beneuolence of the multitude; and from thence foorth the most assured fidelitie of the souldi∣ers
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
gotten, it doth adde vnto it securitie and constant∣nesse in anie enterprise, seeing indeede euerie man hopes to obtaine greater things, bearing themselues valiantlie in fight, when they knowe that in little things the libera∣litie of the Generall commeth of the proper benignite of his owne minde. It is necessarie that the Generall with his warrelike counsaile doe deliberate vppon euerie mat∣ter, and they beeing partakers of the counsailes are sworne in time and place to tell their iudgements, the which to∣gether with him of euerie thing ought to debate, forso∣much as all those things not anie man of himselfe hath found: hee maie alone by studie with himselfe examine, but hee ought not straightwaies to approue and confirme it, for that our thoughts and counsailes as a thing, vnto the which wee haue a naturall affection, if of others faith∣full counsaile it be not holpen, easilie it maie beeguile vs, and manie times it is found full of errours, contrariwise those things that by iudgement and opinion of others bee approued, doe assure the minde and keepe things stable and sure. Notwithstanding no man ought so little to trust to himselfe that alwaies he be of opinion weake and doubt∣full, nor of himselfe so much too presume that hee thinke other cannot finde counsaile better then his: for that it shall bee necessarie that hee which is alwaies subiect too the counsaile of others, hauing altogether distrust of himselfe, came to chaunge infinit things whereby in weightie mat∣ters both hurt and incommoditie doth follow, as likewise he must needes either alwaies or oftentimes commit er∣ror, that not hearing the aduise of other, euerie thing doth attribute to himselfe alone. The Generall shall often and vnlooked for resort vnto the Captaines tents and places of aboade to see in what towardlie readinesse they are or maie be in of a sodain, that hee cause the Captaines often to make like resort vnto the vnder officers and souldiers to see if they bee in the like orderlie readinesse for anie so∣deine seruice. Hee must receiue into his handes the order

<HEAD>The office of the Maister of the Campe.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ince it standeth with the of∣fice of him that will gouerne well to be as forward in main∣teining the good, and rewar∣ding those that deserue well, as in sinceritie of iudgement to punish the wicked and of∣fenders: the maister of the campe, bearing the entire and full authoritie of the office of a Generall, is to haue a re∣gard, that iustice beare as great swaie in his armie as in anie the best ordered citie that can bee. And therefore hee must prouide Iustices sufficientlie practised and studied, that they maie bee able to see what iustice will aforde in e∣uerie case, alwaies prouided, notwithstanding that the lawes of armes be not broken, then the case vnderstood, let them decide the matter, and giue sentence brieflie. For in the Campe they are bound to obserue nothing but that which the Captaine Generall shall appoynt, and that which naturall reason shall chieflie allowe of, admitting herein the Canons of the holie lawe of Christendome, to which all the good souldiers, as euerie faithfull Christian is bounde to be obedient vnto. Next the maister of a campe hath to appoynt an <HI>Agozzino, Arcaldo,</HI> or a Prouest, who besides that he must be well seene in his Arte, must haue regard that hee entertaine a conuenient retinue of assistauntes, and amongest the rest a Pretor or mai∣ster of iustice. Hee must ordeine also that this Prouest
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
with his seruauntes, and the Maister of iustice goe apparelled ciuiltie, and not as the custome is in manie cities like abiectes, that thereby they maie haue credite in their office, and be obeied as they ought, and this must bee proclaimed through the armie generall: namelie, that they obeie these officers vppon paine of death. Hee must forbid all souldiers except Sergeants who in diuers cau∣ses ought to haue their weapons about them to restrict all others of what fort so euer, by that meanes to preuent those theftes and murthers which are commonlie com∣mitted in such places of men giuen to the spoyle. Hee must cause by all meanes possible all priuie mutinies to be aban∣doned, and all priuie grudges and enmities to bee forgot∣ten, during the time of Warre, which otherwise will bring greate hurte to the Campe, considering that manie doe leaue house and home to goe to Warre, not so much to doe their Countreie seruice or winne to themselues practise in battaile, thereby to become equall in value to couragius mindes, eyther els to deserue paie with the recompence of his doutie deedes, but rather some are pul∣led into the field to kill villanouslie some foe of their owne, or their fathers, or their friendes, men truelie most wor∣thie of a thousand deaths, in that they seeke by treason to murder, in that place where they ought to looke to no∣thing els then to vphoulde iustice, and to procure that she maie haue hir due execution, and in iustice the punish∣ment she deserueth. He must care moreouer that respect bee had that merchauntes and puruaiers and other ar∣tificers that are too furnish the Campe with apparell, victuales, and other nessaries, that such maie haue traficke freelie, to the ende they maie doe it willinglie, and that they bée paied with good and lawfull Money for that they sell, enterteining them courteouslie, and too make them safe conduct as well too departe from thence, as too come thether, that they maie haue a desire too retourne: that by these the Armye maye
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
haue store of things as well commodious for their helpe, as otherwise necessarie for their vse. Hee must rate the victuals at a reasonable price, that the souldiers bée not ouercharged in buying, and that the merchuunt may haue an honest gaine. And as this care must bée had, so those things as lesse necessarie maie bée left to bée sould, as the buier and the seller can agrée, as householde stuffe, sad∣dles, and all other furniture for horse, spiceries, wea∣pons, and such merchandies. Also hee must with greate counsaile and deliberation bestowe the lodgings, as next the trenches to bestowe the artilerie, and other muniti∣ons, and the ordinarie victuals giuing charge that none come néere the pouder with anie fire, neither gonner nor other souldier. He shall assigne the quarters of the campe, to euerie companie his seuerall charge of the artilerie, which must bée kept vnoccupied for what néede so euer there shall bée, appoynting watch and ward continuallie, and that verie strong, whereby the souldiers maie bée the better conueied at pleasure, and the frontes the rea∣dier to bée defended against the enimie. There must by him bée appoynted as it were a streate for Merchaunts, safe for themselfes, and commodious for all the Campe. Then must there in euerie quarter bée appoynted places of ease as for their owne vse, and likewise for killing and dressing Cattell for foode, that by this meanes their lod∣gings maie bée kept cleane and the infection of the ayre a∣uoyded for the benefit of health. Then shall hée appoynt the footmen to bée distinctlie deuided from the Horsemen. Hée must appoynt them so that euerie quarter haue his sere place for victuals: and after they bée lodged it ought to bée his greatest care to sée them well defenced: also that they maie so incampe as they maie haue the benefit of woode and water, especiallie in Winter. These con∣ditions hée must looke too with eyes well opened, viewing them diligentlie and oftentimes: and well considering them. And also hée must foresée that the waie be commo∣dious
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
and readie, by which the armie may march and safe∣lie be brought to the place of incamping. Moreouer, it be∣hooueth necessarilie to dispose both horsemen and footemen toward by daye, and watch by night, in places most daun∣gerous, that the campe may remayne without feare of so∣daine assaults, which otherwise brings great trouble. And when the armie shall by anie accident eyther by daye or night, be forced to come to battaile, he must diligentlie pro∣uide, that the artilerie, the munition and victuals, maie be safelie garded. Likewise the discipline of Warre doth re∣quire at his handes in his owne person a certeine sharpe behauiour, that thereby he maye winne obedience of his souldiers, which is of as greate importance, as anie thing els he can haue. Thus he shall verie well discharge his du∣ty towards his Prince, as otherwise preserue the safety of him and his. Also considering that in an armie there is a greate multitude of men, diuerse in nation, differing in maners, not equall in yeares, in nature not altogether a∣greeing, wherefore they which for pride and insolencie, wil not submit themselues to the martiall ordinaunces, maie bee constrayned through feare of punishment: it appertey∣neth to such, to prouide such sufficient garde, as anie repai∣ring for reliefe, cariages, or otherwise eyther for horsemen or footmen, or other beastes which are continuallie in the hoast to be occupied.

<ITEM><LABEL>Obedience.</LABEL>
2 Such obedience must bée vsed, that none regard the persons, but the office to them appointed, diligent∣lie obseruing the same, anie offending to the contrarie runneth into daunger of the Lawe: for longer then

<HEAD>¶ The lawes and constitutions of the field.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Heere begin the Articles wherevnto</HI> all souldiers which serue vnder Emperour, or any <HI>other King or Prince, ought to be sworne vnto, and</HI> them to keepe and maintaine inuiolated at <HI>all times, and in all places, vpon</HI> such paines as follow.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Irst, yée shall be sworne to be true, iust, and dutifull to his Lord and souereigne, and his graund Generall or chiefe Cap∣taine of the field, to be tractable and obe∣dient vnto euerie officer placed and ap∣pointed to rule ouer him, and to be readie both day and night to serue, whether it be by land or by water, as oc∣casion of seruice shall fall out and require. And whoso∣euer doth repine or sheweth disobedience herein, of what degrée or condition so euer he be, he must be dulie punished by the iudgement of the superiours appointed for that purpose.</P>
<P N="2">2 Item, if there be any which shall blaspheme the almightie God or his diuine word: let such a blasphe∣mer be punished with the losse of his life openlie, and to the terrour of the rest let it be executed. For no doubt the plague of the highest will not depart from the house or tent of the blasphemer. For how should wée vse iu∣stice indifferently vnto men, when we are content with silence to suffer such iniurie to be committed against God? Therefore first straightly punish the offences done against the liuing God, and hée will send thée wisdome better to iudge the causes betwéene man and man.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="49" REF="25"/>3 Item, whensoeuer any chieftaine or Captaine of any band, shall vpon vrgent causes appoint in his ab∣sence any other whome hée shall thinke good, to supplie and execute his roome of Captaineship, euery man ought to follow and obey the said deputie, with no lesse care and diligence then they would the Captaine himselfe, vpon paine of such punishment as the Generall or his assignes shall appoint.</P>
<P N="4">4 Item, that all souldiers must content themselues with their places appointed, béeing ioyned togither in bandes, or seuerall without resistance, whether it bée in marching, watching, incamping, or besieging, béeing al∣so commaunded therevnto by the Captaine or other of∣ficers, vpon such paine as shall bée thought good by the Captaine.</P>

Also it behooueth all Souldiers to defend all Ministers, Priestes of godly calling, and all spirituall persons. But now a daies they be the first to whome abuse is offered, of what opinion or religion so euer they bée: but God no doubt, will iustly plague all such before they bée aware, and when they least suspect it. Also they shall defend all aged men and women: neither shall a∣ny molest and hinder them: if otherwise, vpon paine of losse of his or their liues.</P>
<P N="6">6 Item, that euery souldier shall serue, and is by the lawe of armes bound by long custome to serue thir∣tie daies for euery moneth, and after that rate hée shall

<P N="9">9 Item if that by the appointment of the chiefe ru∣lers of the hoast there be a battaile fought, and that by the mightie power of God, the victorie be obteined on your side, the lawe of armes is such, that if any souldier hath receiued his moneths wages afore hand, he shall be discharged of the same, neither shall he serue any longer for the said wages, after the day of victorie, neither shall owe any thing for it, but he shall be set frée from that moneths seruice.</P>
<P N="10">10 Item, if it chaunce that in time of skirmish or in any other conflict with the enimie, some one do ad∣uenture to flie and runne away from his fellowes, if in the flying, his Captaine or any other souldier by shoo∣ting at him, or by striking at him chaunce to kill him, they shall incurre no daunger for so dooing.

It hath lately béene vsed with more fauour of life, as such an offender to loose his hande, but it is the discre∣tion of the Lord chiefe Generall, in whose handes lyeth both life and death of offenders, after their arraignment and iust condemnation.</P>

<HEAD>A way to march and to conduct foorth the Armie.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F any Generall or Maister of a Campe, Coronell, or Sergeant Generall that hath charge to con∣duct an Hoste to march from one place to another, it is requisit, that if he haue not experience of y<SUP>e</SUP> coun∣trie himselfe, that he carrie such as haue experience, that he with them may consider well of the scituation and place, whether he is to goe with his Hoast, as through Plaines, or néere a Hill, or by Hilles, or on Vallies that haue Hilles on both the sides, or by Woods, or néere to a Wood, or els where a Riuer is néere. It is also requisite that some of the light horse, as well for discouering the enemie, as otherwise to take the breadth of the straights and passages goe before, and to make certificate that according to the breadth the Hoast may march. And put case, that one part of the way be fiftéene foote broade, the Hoast shalbe made to march by fiue in a ranke, because euery footman will haue three foote in breadth from shoulder to shoulder, &amp; sixe foote in length betwixt ranke and ranke, and one foote for euery person, so that 21. foote in breadth, and two myles in length, wil con∣taine an Armie of ten thousand men. After the same rea∣son whether there be twentie or thirtie thousand footmen, according to the measuring of ground by the foote they may bee set in order very easily, neither can the leader bee deceiued when he knoweth how many armed men euery place can containe. And after the same order as the place doth inlarge, he must enlarge the rankes, causing part of

thy Shot to goe before the aray, and part behinde, and o∣ther to goe in succour of thy Horsemen that goe in view∣ing the passages, and the Ambushments, with the whole doings of the enemie: and let an other part be for a vaunt¦gard and retrogard to the ray, to bee able to serue them at néede, and an other part to go alwaies at the flankes of the ray, the which if there bee Ditches, shall serue as a Coun∣ter-mure against the Horsemen of the enemie, and if they be men at armes, they must march on both the sides of the Battaile, and also of the Hargubusiers that doe march by the flanks of the Battaile, and the Lighthorsmen to serue for Scowtes both before and behinde the ray. Also there be abundaunce of Labourers to make places plaine, and to cast downe Ditches and Bridges, and to make defen∣ces and other necessarie things that are required in mar∣ching, the which must bée garded by your Lighthorse and Shot, and when you depart to fayne to goe to some other place then that you go to, and if there bée no men at armes to appoynt to euery Regiment certaine Hargubusiers to serue on Horsebacke, the which may serue in stead of men at armes, and when occasion serues to serue on foote a∣gayne. It is requisite that all Souldiers followe their Constables and leaders, and haue great care and diligence in marching, to the end, that by sodaine assaults they bee not at euery steppe to rise in a rumour, and confusedly to runne here and there, and the one to goe contrary to the o∣ther, and finally comming about them, not to be able to do any thing of any profite. For which cause thou oughtest to march with thyne Armie through euery place in bat∣taile ray, whereby the Souldiers may bee made more apt and spéedie to make a voyage, and quicke and readie to re∣sist if néede shall be. They hauing learned to followe the Ensignes and attend to the commaundements, and to be∣haue themselues valiantly, according to their place and or∣der, if thou march in a plaine Countrey, it is requisite that thy Pikes march in battaile ray, retyring thyne Armie in∣to
<PB N="118" REF="70"/>
a little space, so that by the straightnesse and facilitie of inlarging, thou be not constrayned to extend thy selfe into too much length, which fashion of marchings seemes to giue power to the enemie to assault commoudiously their aduersaries, and according to the occasion to hurt them, he knowing to bee taken from them the commoditie to de∣fend themselues, forasmuch either with more largenesse comming against thee, the which is wont to happen both the hornes being compassed, it is like that he shall easilie disorder and put thee to flight, or els giuing charge on the flanke in the midst of thy battaile, hauing alreadie broken thine order, sodeinly stop thy men from being able to goe forward, being closed in the araies of their enemies: wher∣fore mynding to retyre in a mayne battaile, and to turne to resist, they shall bee able to doe little good, as those that haue vsed such a maine battaile, which for want of thick∣nesse is nothing strong, but altogether weake. Also if the enemie should charge thee on the Rereward, thou shalt be brought to the very same necessitie, because thou shalt bee so compassed as thy fronts shall not be able to succour the last, or the last to succour the first. For the which thing it is alwaies better and more sure and easier, to gouerne the bands that march, close and square, then thinne and long, especially, forasmuch as to an armie that marcheth long, oft tymes happens that of some thing seene doubtfull and vncertaine, there groweth sodeinly feare and terrour, be∣cause sometymes it hath chaunced that men descending from high and hillie places, into the plaine, to places expe∣dite and open, and the formost seeing the last of the same band by a great distaunce to come after, supposing them∣selues to bée assaulted of some Ambush of enemies, it hath bene seene, they haue sodeinly turned to fight, and after∣wards no otherwise then enemies, with their owne com∣panyons, gone together by the eares. The victualles, the cariages, and all the rest of prouision, I iudge should bée placed in the midst of the armie, that without great daun∣ger
<PB N="119" REF="70"/>
such things may bee caried and conducted after the ar∣mie: but if it shall be otherwise the hindmost part would be garded and defended of the most valiant Souldiers, as in the fronts, because that at vnwares may happen many things, thy Lighthorsmen going before inuestigating and spying where they may passe, hauing occasion to passe by Mountaines, Woods, places closed with Hilles and most great Desarts, because the enemie many tymes by opor∣tunitie will lay an Ambush priuely by the passage to as∣sault his aduersarie, which little thereof taking heede, hath easily broken and brought them to vtter decay, the which Ambushments if the conductor by way of explorators shal foresee with a little paine, hauing preuented the counsaile of the enemie, may get him a most great name of prudēce, and likewise saue his Armie. And as for the Plaines thou with thyne owne eyes maist see a farre off, forasmuch as in the day dust moued and lifted vp into the aire, doth shew the mouing and stirring of the enemie, and in the night the fires and flames signifieth their Camp to be nere. When thy men are to be conducted and not to fight, thou oughtest to remoue by day, if peraduenture some thing do not con∣straine thée, for the which thou thinkest it good to goe in hast to come before thyne enemie, where in déede for such occasion thou mayst remoue by night; so that thou knowe it may safely bee done to fight with the enemie. Leade thy men not in haste but softly, and inforce them not to make too long a iourney, forasmuch as labour taken before men doe come to fight, is seene most oftentimes vaynly to con∣sume and wast the strength of their bodies. And marching in the Countrey of thy frends, it is néedfull to commaund thy souldiers that in no maner of wise they touch or marre any thing, but rather altogether to refraine, considering that Souldiers hauing weapons and libertie to doe what shall please them, will fauour nothing, especially, for that the sight of things that please men, out of doubt is woone most daungerously to leade ignoraunt and vnwarie men
<PB N="120" REF="71"/>
to desire them, and with the swéetnesse of robbing to en∣tice them to all manner of mischiefe, whereunto if thou prouide not, thy friends and thy confederates for verie small occasion will become enemies. Notwithstanding, the Countrey of thyne enemies, thou shalt suffer thy soul∣diers openly to destroye, burne, and consume, because by the dearth of victualles and lacke of money, Warres are woont to diminish, and bee extinguished: and contrarywise through abundance and riches they are nourished &amp; main∣teyned, but first before thou suffer thyne enemies Coun∣trey to be destroyed, thou shouldest giue aduice to thyne e∣nemies, threatning them what thou wilt doe, if they will not yéeld vnto thée: for that the perill of the miserie prepa∣red, and the feare of ruyne looked for, ofttymes constraines men to graunt many things, the which at the first by no maner of meanes had bene possible to haue brought them to passe, but after they haue once receiued the hurt, they will make little account of thée, and despise al other things as though thou couldest doe them no more harme. Albeit if thou knowest surely that in the Countrey of thyne ene∣mies thou must tarrie long with thyne Armie, suffer to be taken and spoyled those things onely which thou seest not to bee greatly profitable vnto thee: but the same which is to bée thought may bée preserued for thy commoditie, commaund openly to thy Souldiers that they forbeare. Hauing made readie and set in order thy men, tarrie not long in thyne owne Countrey, nor yet in thy confederats, least that consuming all thy prouision, it seeme not that thou art of greater hurt to thy friends then to thyne ene∣mies, but rather conduct quickly thyne Armie into thyne aduersaries countrey, whereby it be fertile and abundant, there may bee taken at thy neede most plenteously those things that thou list: but if it be otherwise, thou shalt cause to be knowne, y<SUP>t</SUP> thou séekest to prouide most louingly both for the wealth &amp; profite of thy friends. Besides this, thou oughtest to care with al diligence that marching or incam∣ping
<PB N="121" REF="71"/>
by sea or land, victuals maie safelie be brought, foras∣much as by such meanes the marchants with all dilli∣gence will bring all things, whiche for the vse of an armie shalbe necessarie. Moreouer, when thou must passe by straights, or march through rough and hillie waies, then is it cōuenient principallie for the preseruation of thy things, to send before shot on horsbacke and on foote, for the kée∣ping of those places, rocks, or inclosed waies, least the eni∣mie taking it before thee, maie both let thy passage to thy great hinderance and losse: the contrarie thou oughtest to inforce thy selfe to do, when thou vnderstandest the enimie to passe, the like thou hast not onelie to take heede for recei∣uing harme, but to enforce thy selfe to turne against the enimie, those deceits whereby he thought to deceiue thee. And when thou purposest to goe against him, it is requisite to prouide before him, and at vnwares oppresse him. So diligentlie thou oughtest to prouide to lette him eue∣rie waie if thou vnder∣standest that he in∣tendes to pur∣sue thee. (∴)</P>

If in that place in which they are determined to giue the siege, as conuenient to compasse the Citie with the armie, there be anie Pallaice or place of commoditie it must be allotted for the Liuetenaunt generall. If there bee none, let there be made a square vale of cunning men, well trenched and cast into this forme following, which I haue resembled partlie too that of former time, or anie other forme, as the Platte will best beare, or the counsaile of those which are of greater experience herein then I, can better deuise. But of what sort soeuer it be, it must be such, that the men at armes maie lodge about the Generall, and the Launces about the men at armes, the pikemen about the Light horse, and the hargubusiers about the pikes, ac∣cording to the manner and forme mentioned in the ende, that when by anie sodaine chaunce either by daie or night, the campe shall bee sette on by the mightie multitude and force of the enimie, especially by night, the hargubusiers and the pikes maie for a while make resistaunce in the head, till the Light horsemen and the Launces with the men at armes haue leasure to arme themselues, and come with the Launces in the front one foote, in manner of pikemen to the Pauilion of the greate Generall, &amp; so armed as they they are to trie the vttermost of their strength and courage be, to saue their General and their armie, to their owne ho∣nour: which they maie doe verie well, if so be that they wil not sticke to rush vpon their enimies, and with their Laun∣ces seruing for armed men, maie encounter with the pike∣men, whereby they maie both defend their owne valiant∣lie, and beat backe their footmen, mauger their force, con∣sidering that they shall bee in complet armour and fresht,

and their enimies but armed in part, and alredie tired with the hot onset they haue had in the fronts, and beesides the footemen beeing newlie supplied and somewhat refreshed may breake in by the flanke and backes of the enimie, so that they maie repent themselues that they euer attemp∣ted an onset to their so great losse, and greater shame, as enforced to flie and forsake their enterprise, onelie by the might and worthinesse of the armed men, wherevppon the armed men, as well bard as light, shall at all times for their great honour, and for the aforenamed necessitie, lodge about their Generall. I haue seene the armed men, and the light horsemen lodged, some at the entraunce of the trench within the banke, and other without, not farre from the ditch of the saide trench: howbeit I haue alwaies thought some ouersight to be therein. But I submitte my selfe still to better iudgement, for that if by night as I haue saide they shall bee assailed, they must needes bee taken vnproui∣ded and vnarmed, then will they not bee able to make a∣nie long resistance, so that the enimie breaking in vppon them, shall finde the footemen with the Generall, destitute of the defence of the bard and light horse: wherevppon without all doubt, they shall bee killed without respect, or taken prisoners, or otherwise flie from their tents, with their greate dishonour. The forme of the Campe I haue set downe at the ende of this discourse in figure, partlie shewing how the ditch should be cast about the Plat. The space of the plat must bee agreeable to the quantitie of the armie, which is to bee determined vp the Maister of the Campe, the Sergeant Maior, and the whole counsell. Wherevpon the greater armie must haue the greater plat, and the lesse armie the lesse plat. Alwaies prouiding, that the streets for the inner lodgings be made wide inough, as∣wel for y<SUP>e</SUP> ease of the souldier, as for the vse of the merchant and purueier, as also for whatsoeuer sodain chaunce may happen: seeing that if not in order of battell, yet in this double ordred forme, one man may take anothers place, and

by that meanes help one another, The ditches shall be 80, paces broad and as deepe as maie be, if the st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ninesse of the ground, or some hard rocks doe not hinder as it doth about the <HI>Trapanian on Sicile.</HI> For about two miles from the citie, there, rowes a huge rocke. This largenesse of the ditch is necessarie during the time of anie siege; but especi∣allie if the armie be incounted in a Plat not well defenced of it selfe, thereby to be safe from al <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines and sleights of the enimie, both by daie and night. But marching by the waie, there is no such depth nor largnesse required, especi∣ally if the aduersaries armie be not in waite too set vppon you. Howbeit it is good alwaies to lodge safelie, beeing in your enimies land or otherwise in place of daunger and I perswade my selfe, that this is a varie profitable forme of lodging, for that if the enimie set vppon them in their lod∣gings, hée shall finde them ariued and ordered in a qua∣drant battaile, and flanked on euerie side with hargu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣siers and artillerie. And béesides the horsemen beeing in the midst, the enimie will suppose that all the strength lieth in the head, whereas the horsemen maie come forth armed and set vppon them by the flankes and béehinde, through the benefite and scope of the large streats which are from the North too the South, and from the East too the West, and breaking vppon the enimie thus at vna∣wares by the flankes and behind them, maie endamage them to their shame and confusion. It is to bee noted, that the Coronels, the Captaines and other head Officers must lodge about their charge of footmen, to the ende that the souldier in sight of his Captaine dare not doe the thing which honestie will not brooke. And moreouer there must bee care had that the watch and ward and scouts bee not raised before morning, not that the gates of the Campe, be opened to any, before the Sunne be a good height and the spialls bée sent to view if there be no priuie ambushments appointed by the enimie too endamage thee and doe thee outrage.

This forme of en∣camping is partlie borrowed of antiquitie, and partlie imi∣tated of the Turkish manner of encamping, in the assiege of anie citie, tieng my selfe alwaies to the memorie of the auncients of former time. If there bee anie who misliketh this, I leaue him to the libertie of his owne iudgement to deuise some other of his owne, and I promise him that I wil be content there with to do him pleasure, and not in this alone, but in all other things aboue shewed in this worke. But if this forme like he shall place the footmen, the horse∣men, the Merchaunts, the Purueiors, the craftesmen, soul∣dier to souldier, backe to backe, and ridge to ridge, making the lodgings double. Vppon the banke of the ditch, and in the Curtaines hee maie place artillerie round about and before it for safetie, or els with the carriage of the muniti∣on, and the carriage of the whole armie enuiron it for his defence. In which he shal imitate the Turke, who with the carriage, with the Cammells, and the Artillerie, both in∣chaine and fortifie the Campe. Néere vnto the artillerie, he shall appoint the Gunners to lodge, who haue the charge thereof, and after the Hargubusters, and so foorth from hand to hand as I haue said. And further he shall cause the Cap∣taines, and Officers to lodge at the backe of the Hargubu∣sters, hauing his Captaine before him, and the Pikes at the flankes, that euerie kinde of souldiers may be conioined, and not dismembred as it were in their seruice, and from their Cap∣taines: which otherwise will be a cause of greater disorder, and manie discom∣modities.

<HEAD>An Oration to be made by the Generall, be∣fore the Battell be fought.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Aliant Knights and Com∣panions in Warre, most thankfullie I accept your seruice, for that you doe offer your liues as true subiects, to accompanie me the Kings high <HI>General</HI> in the warres: wherein you greatlie show your duties. For of right you ought too loose your goods, and to venture your liues at the commaundement of the King, and for the defence and suretie of your Countreye, giuing vnto you, not onelie thanks for your companie, but much more for your good counsell, which dailie you giue me. For in great conflicts, seldome is found together both good counsell and stoute hearts, minding not too enterprise this battell in hope of mans power, for then had you reason wee should not giue battell, seeing the great multitude in respect of vs. For as you saie, the waightie affaires, of a publike weale, should not bee vnaduisedlie committed too the vncerteine of For∣tune: the which hath caused the King my Maister to apoint me in this daungerous and perilous warres. First, trusting that on our part there remaineth Iustice, and sith God is the same onelie Iustice, I trust assuredlie he will giue mee the victorie in this perillous conflicts, for Iustice auaileth princes more that they haue, then the men of Warre doe which they lead. Wherefore sith our cause is iust, and that we haue God the onelie Iudge thereof on our sides, mee thinks no worldlie feare should make vs cease to giue the battell: for I should show my selfe to be of small faith, and also blaspheme God, saying, hee were of small Iustice, for
<PB N="131" REF="80"/>
God sheweth his power there, where the frailenesse of man hath least hope. Then since by the King our Maister and Gouernour, we are appointed and procured to come to this warre, I haue determined my most louing Companions and fellow Souldiers to enter in battell, and valiantlie to aduenture my life with you: and if I perish therein, I shall be sure it shall be for the saluation of my soule, and the me∣morie of my person, for to die through Iustice is not to die, but to change death for life: and thus doing, if I loose my life, yet I loose not my honour, and all this considered, I doe that which to my Prince and the Common-wealth I am bound. For to a Prince it were great infamie and dis∣honour, the quarrell being his owne, should by the bloud of others séeke reuenge, minding this daie to trie in battel, whether the pleasure or will of the liuing God bee to giue vs victorie, the which maie bee a warning to others of the great wrong offered vs: if otherwise he suffer vs to perish, the ende of the sword of the enimie, is but the scourge of our offences. The best I see therefore in this matter to be done, is that we confesse our selues vnto the celestial God, preparing our selues to receiue our redéemer, euery man to pardon and forgiue his brother, if hee haue done wrong or iniurie vnto him, for oftentimes though the demaund of the warres be iust, yet many mishaps befal therin, through the offences of those which pursue and follow the same.</P>
<P>Now each thing accomplished as behooueth according too my saying, then let God dispose things as hee shall seeme good. Wherefore my louing, valiant and stout Souldiers, doubt not at all, for this daie I must either vanquish mine enimies, or els suffer death: and if I die I do that which I néeds must. Wherefore I will now cease to exhort you any more, desiring you most louingly to consider that, where∣vnto your dutie leadeth you, remembring that you are come as Knights, and in the defence of your Countrie to wage battell, beeing now come to that pinch, that deedes must more auaile vs then words: for peace ought too bee

maintained by the tongue, but warres ought to be atchiued by the sword.</P>

<HEAD>A discourse of the Author, with a conclu∣sion and end of the profession of Armes.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S for besieging of a Citty or Towne, fortifications, and placing of battery, I haue not intreated of, because y<SUP>e</SUP> dailie practise and execution of the same, besides the publication therof by many excellent wri¦ters, by whome thou mayest receiue profitte sufficient, nei∣ther haue I written of the offices or training of horse∣men, because there is little alteration from the seruice vsed in antiquity, sauing the hargulaters on horseback, the which at the discrecion of the <HI>Generall</HI> are to skir∣mish or disorder a battell: onelie their places of seruice in y<SUP>e</SUP> field with the battels I haue noted &amp; not otherwise the varietie of weaponnes and alteration of seruice is onely in footmē: of the which for the great desire I haue to the profiting of my country, I haue boldly intreated of, trusting that those errors that may happen through default of my writing may bée without harme to any man corrected, the whych are the onelie strength and bulwarke of the fielde, the defence both of horse and shotte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Swi∣zers the first inuen∣ters of squa¦drons,</NOTE> as appeareth by the poore <HI>Swizers,</HI> who not bée∣ing able to furnishe themselues with Horse, were the first deuisers of the pike and the Squadronnes, who sea red not after they founde the strength and aduaun∣tage thereof to encounter with 20000. footemen, any number of horsemen, whose victories hath caused dy∣uerse nations to imitate them. The <HI>Romanes</HI> what multitudes of horsemen so euer they were to fight a∣gainst, neuer vsed more then their accustomed num∣ber,
<PB N="157" REF="95"/>
the which was to 1000, footemen, a 100. horsemen, putting their whole confidence in theyr footemen, as appeared, when they fought against <HI>Tigrane</HI> King of <HI>Armenia,</HI> who inuading their Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tigrane ouerthrone by the Ro∣mās hauing 150000. horsemen with 25000 footmen &amp; 6000 horsemen.</NOTE> with 150000 horsemen, were encountered of the <HI>Romanes</HI> wyth 250000, footmen, and 6000. horsemen: being of them vt∣terly subuerted, with many other notable victories, the which the <HI>Romanes</HI> did, as in <HI>Titus Liuius</HI> thou mayst plainly sée. Wherefore horsemen art to be accompted as seconde, and not as superiour or principall of the fielde, because horsemen cannot goe as footemen in eue∣rie place, being slower then the footemen to obey, when it is requisite to alter the order: forasmuch, as if it bée néedefull either going forward, to turne backeward, or turning backwarde, to goe forwarde, or to moue them∣selues, standing still, or going to stande still, without doubt, the Horse can not doo it so readelie as the foote∣men.</P>
<P>The horsemen can not béeing with violence disorde¦red, returne in their orders, but with great, difficulty, the which the footemen doo most easelie and quicklie.</P>
<P>Besides this it happeneth manie times that a valiant man shall be vpon a vile horse, and a coward vppon a good, whereby it followeth that these euill matching of stomakes, makes disorder.</P>
<P>Neither is it to be meruailed at, that a bande of footmen susteineth al violence of horses, for that a horse is a beast, and knoweth the perils, and with an ill will, will enter vpon the Pike: &amp; if you consider what force maketh them goe forwarde, and what holdeth them backwarde, you shall perceiue the same to be greater which kéepeth them back, then that which maketh them goe forwards: for that the spurre maketh them goe for∣ward, and the Pike and Sword kéepeth them backe, so that it must néedes be, that footemen are most inuinci∣ble, and superiour to horses.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="96"/>And if you should argue with mee, that the heate which they come withall, maketh them more furious, regarding the spurre more then the Pike: I say, the Horse perceiuing himselfe to runne vpon the point of the Pike, eyther of himselfe, he will refraine the course, turning on the right hand or lefte: or els féeling hym∣selfe pricked or gawled, will stande still. As for exam∣ple, prooue a Horse, and runne him against a wall, and you shall finde fewe with what furie soeuer they come withall, will strike against it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Caesar with his horse feared to encoun∣ter the squa¦drons of the poore Swi∣zers.</P>
<P>The policy of Henry the 5. at E∣gincourt,</P></NOTE><HI>Caesar</HI> hauing in <HI>Faunce</HI> to fight with the <HI>Swizers,</HI> caused all his horsemen to alight a foote, to auoide from the Squadrons, as a thing more méeter to flie then to fight.</P>
<P>Footemen being politique hath manie other helpes as by making of Trenches, and as King <HI>Henrie</HI> at <HI>Egin-court</HI> vsed sharpe stakes, whereby hée gotte the Chiualrie of <HI>Fraunce.</HI> Or to cause of Iron to be made Galtropes a handfull long, and to be made sharpe like a Triangle, euerie man to haue one of these to throwe vppon the ground at the encounter of the horse.</P>
<P>Besides, the wise Captayne will choose groundes of great aduantage. And as for the Pistolate is not so much in vse as they haue bene: vsing chéeflie the Calée∣uer on horsebacke, the which is nothing comparable to the footeman with the Caléeuer, who will from euery little Moll-hill gall him at his pleasure, besides more readier for anie seruice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses ne∣cessar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the fielde,</NOTE>Horses notwithstanding are verie necessarie in the fielde for discouering the Enimies Countrey, and to destroie their forrage, and to burne and wast, all that is not within the fortified Townes, and to kéepe trou∣bled and disquieted the Armie of the Enimies, where∣by not onelie to lette them of their rest, but to kéepe them troubled and wearied in the ir Armour.

let them of theyr victualles. Lykewise, necessarie for Vancurriers, or for Scowte: and when the Battaile is fought, and Victory obtained they are to ouertake, runne downe, and ruerthrowe the Enimie expulsed.

<P>Now hauing finished the Warres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the re∣traite out of thy ene∣mies coun∣trie,</NOTE> and a full deter∣mination of peace concluded: béeing in thy late eni∣mies Countrie, it behooueth thée to haue great care, and with great diligence to retire thy souldiours, from the Enimies countrie, kéeping so good order as if the Enimie would falsifie his vowe made, to take anie ad∣uauntage of thee: yet that hee maie finde thée so pre∣pared and in so good order: as hys wyles shall lyttle endamage thée, giuing great charge vnto thy Cap∣taynes, and so to the Officers, that thy Souldiours straggle not from thy Campe to doo anie outrage, or by violence séeke to take anie thing away, but as they passe the Countrie, honestlie and true∣lie to paye for that they take, whereby thou maist bée the better thought off of the Enemie, as other∣wyse to auoyde all inconueniences, that maie fol∣lowe.

And against their ar∣riuall sée that monie bée prepared for the present pay∣ment of the poore souldiours that they to their detry∣ment, and hinderaunce doo not long remaine vnpaied, whereby theyr heartes may bée hardened and through this default mutinies arise, and many inconueniences growe, considering that at the commaundement of the Prince as true subiects they haue aduentured theyr li∣ues, and in the defence of their Countrie: but it is great pitty, y<SUP>t</SUP> fauour dooth so much preuaile, and experience so little estéemed, that so manie be suffered to beare the Office and authoritie of Captaines, whose going to the warres, is rather to bribe and hinder the poore Soul∣diours, to the dishonour of their Countrie and theyr owne shame, then to merite any thing in the Warres to the profitting of the same. Trusting that great and wyse Officers in tyme by trying the cause, will sée it reformed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An exhor∣tation ne∣cessarie for all Cap∣taines at the discharge of theyr soul∣diours,</NOTE>The Souldiours being paide, it were verie requisite that euerie Captaine shoulde call their companie toge∣ther, or a little before theyr wages payde: yéeldinge thankes vnto them for theyr dilligence and paines in the Princesse affaires, certefying them that the almigh¦tie God no doubt, will prosper them the better in all their affaires.</P>
<P>And where as euerie subiect by GODS lawe in conscience, and by the lawe of Nature, are to be at the commaundement of their Prince and Gouernour, their trauailes and paines in the turmoile of warres hath de clared the same, letting them to vnderstand the warres being ended: the Prince is not further to vse them, ex∣horting euerie man, quietly to depart into his Country from whence he was prest, or to the place of his longest abode, not looking to make an Art or exercises of armes

for that it is not to bee vsed, but when the Prince through constraint shall be inforced to the same. And when they are come into their Countrey, require euery man to frame him self to such Science, Occupations, Trades or Traffickes, as they haue chiefly bene brought vp with all, accompting themselues most happie that GOD hath deliuered them from the bloodie warres to liue in peace &amp; quiet: the which bringeth so many commodities, so many vertues, and so much good as I am not able to expresse. For to make warres to haue peace is Christianitie, and to trouble the peace by making warres vniustly, is Tyrannie. Now the fruites of the ydle, the which scornes their occupations, through necessitie are nothing els but robberies, thefts and murders, and then Iustice enforced to extinguish them.</P>
<P>Most louingly desiring them not to forget the great daungers that almightie God hath deliuered them from, through the which they were men prepared to dye, hauing the same printed alwaies in their minds, by which meanes they shalbe the better able to see Iustice mainteyned, peace preserued, Magistrates and Officers obayed, and they the better as true Christians, to liue in the feare of God: thus doing, they shall not onely shewe themselues as true and duetiful Souldiers to their Prince, but like the Souldiers and seruants of Iesus Christ, who of his infinite mercie, bring all Souldiers to the hoast of Heauen. Amen.</P>
<P>The Generall, principall Officers and Captaines are in conscience bound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Ge∣nerall and Chieftaines are in consci∣ence bound to be Mediators vnto the Prince, for the reliefe of the hurt and lame Souldiers.</NOTE> to be most earnest suiters and Media∣tors vnto the King and Prince, for the reliefe, helpe, and maintenaunce of the hurt, lame and sicke Souldiers: be∣ing a part of Christianitie to see them comforted, who in the Princes affayres and vnder their conduct, haue receiued their hurts: and that those that haue serued in the warres vntill they be aged, and the maimed, might haue yerely sti∣pends for their maintenaunce, during their liues, and the hurt and sicke to be holpen, at the charges of the Countrey from whence they were prest.</P>

<P>What Nation but <HI>England</HI> but cherisheth Souldiers, and prouideth for men of seruice, trusting that some noble mindes at the next Parliament may haue in remembrance some of these good Lawes decréed by Emperous, Kings and Princes, whereby some Act may passe for the reliefe and maintenaunce of Souldiers, the which would cause such a willingnesse &amp; pristinate valour in English mindes, that no Nation should be comparable vnto vs.</P>
<P>And as there is al diligence vsed for to make men faith∣full, peaceable, and to liue in the feare of God, by the Go∣uernours of warre was doubled: for in what man ought the Countrey to seeke greater faith, then in him who must promise to dye for the same? In whom ought there to bée more loue of peace, then in him which onely by the warre may bee hurt? In whom ought there to hee more feare of

For as the Poets haue fayned <HI>Minerua</HI> to bee armed: signifying, that Cap∣taines should bee as wise in counselling, as couragious in conquering: as politicke in keeping, as valiaunt in get∣ting.</P>
<P>And <HI>Tullie</HI> in his first booke of Offices speaketh of a double commoditie these men doe yéeld to their Countrie: who making warres goe armed, and roabed doe gouerne the Commonwealth.</P>

<P>And as the vse of warres ought to bee applyed for the defence of right to shield vs from iniuries wherby to plant a commodious state of life, so the studies thereof are to bee vsed in time of peace, for exercise, and in the time of warre, for necessitie and for glorie, and to suffer onely the Com∣monweale to vse it for an Arte: so likewise as peace is the nourse of store and increase of things, if respect in tyme bee not had for the prouision of Munition, money, weapons and men prepared both in mynds and by exercise trayned for the warres, it wil cause in necessities but faynt warres, beseeching the liuing GOD, that this carelesse liuing in

securitie, be not so pernicious vnto the Commonweale, as the detracting of tyme shall enforce vs to take counsaile when it is to late.</P>
<P>The Quéenes Maiestie with her wise Counsell hath made so good prouision of Munition for the Land, likewise of Shippus for the Sea, as no Realme for the quantitie better prouided: but if men be not trayned and exercised for the vse thereof, it will serue to no other purpose, then men taken from the Land, to bee Pylates of Shippes well ap∣poynted in the daungerous Seas. Besides, her Maiesties prouision vpon euery occasion is not to bee broken, neither vppon a sodaine inuasion easily to bee transported to the hands of her subiects, for defence of her Maiesties Coun∣trey, the which y<SUP>t</SUP> Counsell hath wisely foreseene, but their Commissions are so simply executed, as I greatly doubt, when necessitie shall enforce to the vse of the same, they shal altogether be deceiued.</P>
<P>The reason is, the Commissions are directed vnto the chiefe of euery Shiere, and by them are appoynted, such Muster maisters as hath good skill in the Law, the flying of a Hawke, or experience in choosing of a fat Bullocke or Shéepe: supposing because we haue liued a tyme in peace, that wee shall alwaies liue in this securitie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How those that hath ex∣perience in Martiall af∣fayres should be appoynted for Muster maisters.</NOTE> despising to craue the assistance of the Souldier, who hath aduentured his life for his Countrie, being neuer so expert or of so good behauiour, because he is poore, and for that a Souldier will not see his Countrey deceiued by their Muster bookes, as to put in so many able Caliuers, so many able Corstets, so many able Billes, and so many able Bowes, the which wil prooue when occasion shall serue to vse them, to bee halfe lame. I meane, because such as are appoynted to haue a Caléeuer furnished, shall passe the booke with an olde rustie Peece without a Flaske, Touchboxe, Martion, Match, Powder, Sword, or Rapier and Dagger: and such as are appoynted to haue Corssets furnished, that is, to haue good Curates for their bodies, Taces for their thighes, Pol∣drones
<PB N="165" REF="99"/>
and Vambrases for their shoulders &amp; armes, Bur∣gonites for their heads, good Pikes, and Swordes, and Daggers, these shall passe the Musters with a little olde broken yron of their backs, or if he haue an old Almon Ri∣uet on his backe, although he lacke his Taces, and many other péeces, so he haue a Pike he shall be very wel armed, and yet men of that abilitie as they are, are able some to furnish 1.2. or 3. men, and keepe them continually in pay: And the Bill men who are appoynted for execution and slaughter of the field, the which of necessitie must be armed at all poynts, these shal passe as men had in no estimation, with a Skull on his head, and a Pikestaffe on his shoul∣ders. Likewise the Bowmen without Iackes, Skulles, or sufficient Bowes, according to their strengths, with two or three Shaftes by their sides in their doublets and hose, shal passe for able Bowmen: through the sufferance wher∣of, not only the Queenes Maiestie but the Countrey shall bee deceiued, if it bee not presently looked vnto, trusting the wise Counsell will see it reformed, by assisting the chiefe of the Shiere, with such Souldiers whome experience hath made to knowe what is méetest for men to apparell them¦selues withal for the warres: and for that none are appoin∣ted but such as are of great abilitie for the prouision of the same, so after sufficient warning giuen by the Muster mai∣sters, as is appoynted for their Furniture, not well oyled and kept for the present vse, if default bee founde either in lacke of such Furniture, they to haue a fine set vppon their heads, the which they should truely pay, and that money to bee bestowed vpon Match and Powder, the which should be spent vpon the trayning day, and that such might be ap∣poynted for the trayning of Souldiers as are knowne to haue experience to instruct and teach them that, that they may profite themselues and their Countrie, and not by fa∣uour to choose such Captaines as are to bee taught by the poore Souldiers, and that consideration by the Countrey for their paines might be vsed: and at the daies appoynted
<PB N="166" REF="100"/>
for trayning, the chiefe of the Shiere to be present in their warre-like attyre, and to exercise themselues and their hor∣ses, with running at the Ring, and such poynts of seruice as is meetest for Horsemen, as otherwise to see the tray∣ning of Pikes and Shot, whereby if election bee made of Captaines not able to instruct like a Captaine, that others might bee appoynted that hath experience. And if Noble∣men and Gentlemen would see these exercises honourably frequented, we should not feare the wicked practises of for∣reine Princes, to be in hostile oppression, for that those Na∣tions seeing the discipline and martiall prowesse of a state so well gouerned, prouided, and defended, may feare to of∣fer vs iniuries, being glad to desire fauour and league, when things in this good stay and safetie are con∣firmed and established through this course of life, we shall be most happie, and do our Lord God best seruice, so that our felicitie may hereafter endure for euer.</P>
