<P>O Thou Judge eternall, we the finfullest of all the sons of Men; that have abused thy Mer∣cies, provoked thy judgments, unsheathed thy glittering sword, forced all the Arrows and Darts out of thy Quiver, and with our multiplied, abominable crying sins, brought down a desolation on a most pleasant land (that former delight of thine) the glo∣ry of all lands.</P>

O Lord, we wait on thee this day for this blessing; make no long tarry∣ing, but according to the time thou hast plagued us, send us deliverance. Snatch the prey out of the Lyons teeth, and pull us out of the burnings like a fire∣brand: We beseech thee, that We may this day spread before thee the words of <HI>Rabshekah,</HI> the proud railings, and scornfull re∣proaches

Think upon all those that are peace∣able, and faithfull in the Land, and deal thou with us accord∣ing to thy Word, wherein thou hast caused us to put our trust; Let the world see that there is a God that judgeth the earth, and will send deliverance to his people in their needfull time of trouble. But whatsoever thy purpose is, let not us behave our selves frowardly, but with all Christian humility, run the race that thou settest before us, and patiently bear the indignation,
<PB N="209" REF="120"/>
of the Lord, because we have sinned against him. And we meekly beseech thee, that if the Divine Decree of thy Justice withstand our Petitions, our prayers may return into our own bosomes; and that thou wilt make thy judgements tem∣poral and not spiritual upon us; but assist us with strength pro∣portionable to our temptations; that we be not delivered to evil: but that in wel-doing, we may commit our selves to thee our God, as unto a faithful Creator: And that both our King and we, may say with all Christian sub∣mission and cheerfulness: It is the Lord, let him do what seem∣eth him good.</P>
<P>And here, O Lord, we offer unto thee, all possible praise and thanks for all the Glory of thy Grace, that hath shined forth in thine Anointed, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Soveraign, and that thou wert pleased to own him (this

<P>We Praise thee also for the Courage and Comfort thou hast given unto us of his Party, by that owning and assisting him, or any that have suffered in that Righteous Cause.</P>
<P>And we beseech thee give us all grace to Remember and provide for our latter end, by a Careful, studious imitation of those bles∣sed patterns of thy Saints and Martyrs, that have gone before us, that we may be made worthy to Receive benefit by their pray∣ers, which they, in Communion with thy Church Catholick, of∣fer

<P>But thou, O Lord, how long, how long shall Bloody Designs and Rebellious imaginations prosper? Shall not the Judge of
<PB N="241" REF="136"/>
the whole Earth do Right? Or hast thou forgotten to be Gra∣cious, and shuttest up thy ten∣der Mercy in displeasure?</P>
<P>O No: Thou art the same God, who in the midst of Judg∣ment remembrest Mercy. Thine Arm is not shortned that thou canst not save, nor thine Ear heavy, that thou canst not hear. Arise then, O Lord, Arise, Let the World see, that thou art the Father of the Fatherless, and the Helper of them to Right that suffer Wrong. Shew it, O Lord, especially at this time, in multiplying all thy comforts upon our distressed King.</P>
<P>And, as thou hast strangely and Wonderfully delivered him from those who so eagerly hunt∣ed after his Life; So let it ap∣pear to the World that: thou hast not done this to make him more miserable, or to continue him in the Condition of an Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e; But rather, that thou
<PB N="242" REF="137"/>
hast reserved him for Faithfull Hands, and fairer Opportuni∣ties and more prosperous suc∣cesses.</P>
<P>And though that was not the Time, nor those the Means, by which thou hast designed to re∣store the Kingdom to him, Yet that thou hast not forsaken him, but that He is still in thy Care, still under the shadow of thy Wings, who alone art able to do more for him, then we can pray for; and Gloriously to bring him back again, by wayes we cannot think of. In the mean time, O Lord, whilst thou think∣est fit to keep him under the sharpnesse of this Discipline, Teach him to kisse the Hand that chastens him, and humbly to submit his Earthly Crown to thy Divine Will and Pleasure; knowing, that thou canst either Restore him That, when it seems good to thee, Or else give him a Crown infinitely more Glori∣ous,
<PB N="243" REF="137"/>
which no man can take from him.</P>
<P>Lord, He is more Precious to thee, then he can possibly be to us: Dispose of Him therefore in the multitude of thy Mercies, And let thy Holy Spirit take so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Possession and Guidance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>im, that among all the Diffi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ties of his most perplexed Af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s, he may constantly per∣form his Duty towards thee, and live and dy thy faithful Servant in Jesus Christ,</P>

<HEAD>A Prayer For the Church.</HEAD>
<P>LOrd, who hast promised to thine Apostles to be with them alwayes unto the end of the world, and for a supply of their mortality, hast in thy gra∣cious providence over thy Church, continued a perpe∣tuall succession of Bishops and Pastors to feed their severall Flocks, whereof the Holy Ghost hath made them overseers: In∣spire them by thy grace, that their lips may preserve know∣ledge, and the people seek thy Law at their mouth. Bless them, O Lord, with the blessings of <HI>Levi;</HI> blesse their substance, and accept the work of their hands; smite through the loyns of them that rise up against them, and of them that hate them, that they rise not again, that they may
<PB N="298" REF="165"/>
shine forth as lights before us, holding forth the word of life, till we all come in the unity of Faith, and the knowledge of Je∣sus Christ, unto that perfection and fulnesse of thine everla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing Kingdome, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>ALmighty God, and gracious Father, we confess against our selves, that we are most wor∣thy of all the Judgements that thou hast threatned against us, these Kingdomes, and this Church, which is now under the Crosse, and neer to utter ruin and extirpation, unless thy mercy step in between thy fierce wrath and our hainous sins. And howsoever the voice of our cry∣ing sins hath ascended into thine ears, and stirred up de∣stroyers to root us out, that we be no more a people, and that thy name be no more called up∣on, nor hallowed by us; yet we most humbly beseech thee to
<PB N="299" REF="165"/>
hear the prayers and supplicati∣ons, with strong cryings and tears which once our blessed Sa∣viour offered for us upon the Crosse, and in the garden, and which he daily represents unto thee. And for his all-sufficient merits, which speak better things than the blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> hear not the cry of our sins, but the cry of his blood, and therein wash all our sins. Let our great miseries and dangers suffice for that which is past, and let that Oratour in thy own bosome, even thine own fatherly good∣ness perswade and prevail for us, and purchase our deliverance and safety. Hear us for our selves and others, Look upon us with the eyes of pitty and com∣passion, consider our enemies how many and how mighty they be, and they bear a tyran∣nous hate against us. Our goods, our lands, our lives will not suf∣fice their boundlesse ambition:
<PB N="300" REF="166"/>
our religion, our souls, and if it were possible, our God, is that they strike at: curse thou their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel. Divide them in <HI>Iacob,</HI> and scatter them in <HI>Israel:</HI> As, for us, deliver us out of their hands, and unite us together in the bond of peace, that being freed from our many and tyrannous enemies, we may ever bless thy sacred and holy name, and evermore serve thee without fear in all holiness and righteousness all the dayes of our life, through Jesus Christ our Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>WE beseech thee, Almighty God, look upon the hearty desires of thy humble servants, and stretch forth the right hand of thy Majesty to our defence against all our enemies, through Jesus Christ our Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>ALmighty and everlasting God, mercifully look upon our infirmities and miseries, and in all our dangers and ne∣cessities, stretch forth thy right hand to help and defend us, through Christ our Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>ALmighty God, which art more ready to hear, than we to pray, and art wont to give more than either we desire or deserve: pour down upon us the abundance of thy mercy, forgiving us those things, where∣of we are afraid, and giving

<P>O Lord our God, mercifull and gracious, and abun∣dant in goodnesse and truth, who dost according to thy will in the Armies of Heaven, and rulest over all the Kingdomes of the Earth, in whose hand is power and might, and none is able to withstand thy Arm; we most vile sinners approach be∣fore thy Throne of grace, be∣wayling those manifold trans∣gressions that have provoked thy wrath and indignation against us, We know, O Lord, that affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground, but it is thou that with rebukes dost chasten man for sin. We confess
<PB N="305" REF="168"/>
that we were a wealthy and a carelesse Nation, and our Land was as the garden of <HI>Eden;</HI> our deliverances were great, and thy blessings were multiplied: we dwelt alone without fear of evill, and were become the en∣vy of those that were round a∣bout us. Peace was within our Walls, and plenteousnesse with∣in our Pallaces. But when we had eaten and were full, and had waxen fat, we kicked against thee our Maker, who hadst done so great things for us: our heart was lifted up and forgot thee our God, and lightly esteemed the rock of our salvation. We loathed the Manna that rained down upon us; our Peace be∣came a wearinesse, and we snuf∣fed at our happinesse; we mur∣mured against <HI>Moses</HI> in our Tents, and made light of thine Annoynted, whom thou hadst set over us. Therefore hast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ou recompenced our wayes
<PB N="306" REF="169"/>
upon our own heads, and suf∣fered our destruction to proceed from our selves: our wicked∣nesse doth correct us, our back∣sliding doth reprove us, and our iniquity is become our ru∣ine. Thou hast broken us with a grievous breach: thy anger hath divided us, and thy fury hath dashed us one against ano∣ther. Thou hast mingled a spi∣rit of perverseness in the midst of us; and made us a Nation void of Counsell and under∣standing: instead of Peace thou hast sent bitternesse, and hast sent a fire into our bowells; and it is kindled round about us. And now, O Lord, behold, the sword is drunk with our blood, and we are numbred to the slaughter: the high-wayes are unoccupied, and the Tra∣vailers go through by-paths: our fields are divided our inhe∣ritance is for a spoil, and our substance to the robbers. We
<PB N="307" REF="169"/>
are become a reproach to the foolish people, and servants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ar rule over us. The mean man is risen against the Honou∣rable, and the fire out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>amble devoureth the lofty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>dars; our Women are cast out of their pleasant places, and the robe is pulled from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ged; there is no respect had to the Priests, nor favour to the Elders. Thy Sanctuaries, even the excellency of thy strength, are prophaned, and they have defiled the places where thine honōur dwelleth, and yet still the seat of wickednesse frameth mischief by a Law; and it turn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>h judgement backward, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ddeth justice stand afar off; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d deviseth deceitful matters against those that are quiet in the Land.

Thus are we covered with a cloud in thine anger, and our beauty is cast down to the ground. But, O Lord, shall thine Indignation be poured out for ever? shall thy jealousie burn like fire? O passe by the transgressions of the remnant of thine heritage, and take a∣way the rebuke of thy people! O remove from us reproach and contempt; and strengthen the spoyled against the destroyers! Bow down thine ear, and con∣sider the oppression of the poor, the sighing of the needy, the groaning of the Prisoners, that are fast bound in misery and Iron. Lift up thy self, be∣cause of the rage of thine Adversaries; consider the deso∣lation they have made in thy Courts, and all that the Enemy hath done wickedly in thy
<PB N="309" REF="170"/>
Sanctuary. And yet still they are compassed with pride, and doath themselves with violence as with a garment. How long, O Lord, shall they boast them∣selves in mischief? how long shall they decree unrighteous decrees, and write grievousnesse which they have prescribed? O make not a full end with us, but correct us in mercy, though thou leave us not altogether unpu∣nished. Helps us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and under the shadow of thy wings, shall be our refuge untill this Tyranny be overpast. Disap∣point therefore the devices of the crafty; let not the Re∣bellious exalt themselves any more, and suffer not the Ta∣bernacles of the Robbers to prosper. And as thou hast be∣gun to shew thy Servants thy greatnesse, and thy mighty hand, so continue thy marvel∣lous loving kindnesse to those
<PB N="310" REF="171"/>
who put their trust in thee. The Battail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> is thine, O Lord, thou hast preserved us from the Arm of flesh; yea, it is thou that hast wrought all our works in us, even when there was no might against that great company that came against us. When we were few in number, and there was none to help us, then thine own Arm brought salvation, and thy righte∣ousnesse sustained us. O perfect therefore thy handy work! Give salvation to our King, and deliver CHARLS thy Servant from the perill of the Sword, bind up his soul i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the bundle of life, gird him with strength to the Battail, con∣tend with those who contend with him, subdue thou the peo∣ple under him, and suffer no weapon formed against him to prosper. O deliver him at length from the strivings of the People, and lift up his head
<PB N="311" REF="171"/>
above his Enemies round about him, give him the shield of thy salvation, and let thy gentle∣nesse make him great: put a stop at last to the madnesse of the people, say to the destroying Sword, it is now enough: send us a seasonable and quiet calm: visit us with the joy of thy Countenance, and make us glad according to the dayes wherein thou hast afflicted us. O restore to us our solemn Assemblies: bring us back into thy Courts to praise thee, and let us once more worship thee in the beauty of thy holinesse! Save us, O Lord, from our Enemies, and from the hands of all that hate us. That so we may serve thee without fear, living a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godli∣nesse and honesty, looking for the blessed appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Je∣sus Christ.

<HEAD>A Confession of Sins, and Prayer for Pardon.</HEAD>
<P>O Lord of heaven and earth, God of the spirits of all flesh, we a most sinfull, and therefore now a most miserable People, do in the bitternesse of our afflicted Souls, humbly fall down at the foot-stool of thy grace, most sadly bewailing our many and most hainous sins. We have multiplied our iniqui∣ties into a violation of thy whole Law, having neither per∣formed to thee our God, nor to man, the duties thou requirest of us, so that by onr wicked works, we have denied that most holy faith, whereof our Mouths have for so long a time made profes∣sion. These things, O Lord, have we done, and because in

goodnesse thou wert pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eep silence, how many of us have thought wickedly, that thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ert altogether such an one as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ur selves; which either didst approve, or at least wouldst not punish the Crimes that we do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed on. And now in thy just judgments thou hast set our sins in order before our eyes; in the continued scourge of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>sting Rebellion, we may well perceive, that the sins we have done, have not been barely in∣firmities, but Rebellions against thee. In the Rapines, acted up∣on the substance thou hast given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we cannot but consider, that by Oaths and Blasphemies, we have robbed thee of thine Ho∣nour, and have oft-times stollen much of that precious time which should have been spent in thy service. Nay we have ad∣ded sin to sin, so that one Crime hath brought forth another Transgression, and thou hast

We confesse, O Lord, with all thank∣fulnesse of heart, that thou hast been pleased to sweeten the bit∣terness of this Cup by many strange successes, by frequent and unexpected Victories, and yet thou hast so allayed each favour of thine hand, with the mixture of some sudden crosse, that herein, thou hast set our Repentance too before the sight of our eyes, and lets us see 'tis mixt with so much coldnesse &amp; Hypocrisie, that there may be as much guilt in such a kind of Repentance as before there was in our sins. Yet return, O God, in great mercy, return unto the many thousands of thy people: do thou accept, and increase in our hearts detestatiō of all wick∣edness, that our sorrows for sin

<P>Let not spoil, or blood, or mine own advancement, be the ends of mine attempts, but make me to aim only at thy glory in the defence of thy truth, and in the good and safety: of the Kingdome where∣in I live.</P>
<P>The issue of all things to thee (O Lord) is known, but to man it is hidden: Prepare me therefore indifferently to whatsoever shall befall me. If I die give me comfort in my last breathing, and take my soul
<PB N="346" REF="189"/>
into thy gracious hand: If I be taken captive, give me patience, give me wisdom and godly cou∣rage, to do nothing contrary to the honour of my Country, or prejudicial to the profession of a faithfull Christian, If I return with life and victory, make me thankfull: Keep me from taking from thee any part of thy glo∣ry. Preserve me from those riotous, lascivious, and blasphe∣ming courses, which are the usuall fruits of good successe: let me not think devotion to be an enemy to resolution, or that a religious fear of thy Majesty, doth abate the spirit that should be in a Souldier: but settle me in this, that the assu∣rance of a lawfull cause, the hope and confidence of a better life, by the merits of Christ, the care to please thee, and to de∣pend upon thy power, are the only true grounds of valour, which can give a man boldnesse

and life in the day of battel. Vouchsafe me these, and all other needfull favours, in and for Christ Jesus sake,</P>

<HEAD>A Prayer upon the strange re∣volution on the twenty first of <HI>February,</HI> 1659. when the formerly secluded Mem∣bers were readmitted into the House of Commons.</HEAD>
<P>O Most mighty God, who sittest upon the Cherubims, be the people never so impati∣ent; and after thine own counsells governest all that is done among the children of Men.</P>
<P>We most humbly confess, that it is for our sins, that thou hast so often changed thy rod, and brought such variety of confusions upon us; that all the world stands a gaze to see what will become of such a peo∣ple, that will not see the things that belong unto their peace.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="190"/>
But, O gracious God, though we forget our selves, forget not thou thine own goodnesse; for there is yet time for mercy, and such an expedient left as may cure all our wounds, and close up all our divisions; by restoring <HI>him</HI> who was once designed by thee, to be the <HI>common Father</HI> of us all, though we like rebelli∣ous children have disdainfully cast him from us.</P>
<P>And as thou hast begun al∣ready to shew some glimme∣rings of our future happiness, by unexpectedly dissolving the Assembly of those <HI>(Achitophels)</HI> who by their dark counsels, have so long obstructed it: so go on (we most earnestly beg of thee) and let not the sins of this wretched Nation hinder thee from compleating, what thou hast for thine own glory so wonderfully begun.</P>
<P>Work powerfully upon the
<PB N="350" REF="191"/>
minds of all that are any wayes concerned in the redeeming of our peace; Give them but as much honest courage to do right, as they have formerly shewn in acting all those mis∣chiefs, that have been done among us, O plead the cause of an oppressed KING; strenghthen the hands and hearts of all that appear for him; direct his counsels, prosper his enterprizes, make his very ene∣mies to be at peace with him, and when thou shalt vouchsafe to us our former happiness both in Church and State, give us then thankfull hearts to im∣brace it as a blessing from thy hands alone, who hast wrought these great wonders for us, for Iesus Christ's sake.</P>

<HEAD>A Prayer upon the Assembling of the present Parliament, <HI>April</HI> 25. 1660.</HEAD>
<P>O Most great, most wise, and most powerfull Lord God, in whose hands are the hearts of all men, and turned them as thou doest the rivers of wa∣ters.</P>
<P>Shew thy power and come among us, and be present at this great meeting, when after so many years of confusion, there's once more a consultati∣on had to settle this distracted Church and Nation; and as there is nothing hid from thee, who seest the very thoughts and ends, and divided interests of them that meet together; so there is nothing so impossible to thee, but that thou canst by
<PB N="352" REF="192"/>
the hidden workings of thy Providence unite what thou findest divided, and over∣sway every counsell and design, and every imagination that shall set it self against thee.</P>
<P>Let there be no root of bit∣ternesse among them which are intrusted in this great work, no thoughts of revenge; No Am∣bition of making themselves great; no particular or separate interest of their own; but in∣stead of these, give them bowels of, compassion towards their bleeding and expiring Coun∣try; strike a sense into them of the blood already shed, and the desolation yet to come, if they prevent it not.</P>
<P>And let thy fear run through all their consultations, that re∣membring the sad account, which in the last great day will be required of them, they may unanimously set themselves to find out those blessed expe∣dients
<PB N="353" REF="192"/>
as may restore the voice of joy and peace into our dwel∣lings, in such a way as may be most for the glory of thy great Name, the righting of those that are opprest, and the setling of the happinesse of this Church and Nation, upon the right <HI>ba∣sis</HI> of that former government, from which it hath stood so long, so unhappily divided. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>his as being neither impossible to thy Power, nor unusuall to thy Mercy, we most humbly beg for his sake, to whom thou canst deny nothing, even Jesus Christ the righteous,</P>

<P>GLory be to God on high on earth, peace, good will to∣wards men.</P>
<P>We praise thee, we blesse thee, wee worship thee, We glorify thee; and at this time, in a more especiall manner, with the high∣est expressions of our devoutest hearts. We most humbly give thanks unto thee, For that thou hast been pleased out of thine in∣finite goodness, mercifully to look down upon the late low e∣state of our gracious soveraign.</P>
<P>That thou hast brought him from so much scornfull neglect, in so most unjust, so tedious a

banishment, to appear now so terrible unto his enemies, both at home and abroad, that thou hast blessed him through the sole strength of thine own arme, by thine own way, and at thine own time, so much beyond the hopes and expectation of Man, with so signal, and with so dry &amp; bloud∣lesse a victory.</P>
<P>O Lord God, heavenly King. God the father Almighty; O Lord the onely begotten Son Jesus Christ;</P>
<P>As thou hast thus begun with thy wonderfull providence to showre down thy blessings upon the head of the King, and upon the hearts of his subjects, so con∣tinue these thy favours to him and us; and perfect we beseech thee, that glorious work, which none but thine own strength can finish, the establishment of the throne in righteousnesse, the set∣tlement of the Church in purity, and the uniting of these king∣doms
<PB N="356" REF="194"/>
in a well grounded and lasting peace.</P>
<P>And to that end, thou that takest a way the sins of the world take away for ever, from this sinfull land and Nation, the foule sin of rebellion, together with its monstrous of-spring, the crying sins of sacrilege, of perju∣ry and hypocrisy.</P>
<P>Thou that fittest at the right hand of God the Father, smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> through the loynes of those sons of <HI>Eelial,</HI> who oppose the peace of Jerusalem, and that have evill will at ion.</P>
<P>Lord make the enemies of our gracious Soveraigne to fall down before him like <HI>Dagon</HI> be∣fore the Ark. That they may neither have heads to plot, nor hands to put in practice any mischievous design against him. So shall we still blesse and mag∣nifie thy Name, in the midst of the great Congregation; so shall we thy servants never

cease to be still praysing thee, and saying,</P>
<P>Thou onely art holy, thou onely art the Lord, thou onely O Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art most high, in the glory of God the Father.</P>
<P>To thee be all praise, and ho∣nour, and glory, ascribed, world without end,</P>
