<P>MAster tel me
what thyn∣ge
is god. My chyl∣de
he is a thyng spy¦rytuall
in y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche
is all dygnyte / and
all perfeccyon / the
whiche is knowyn∣ge
all thynges / all
myghtye / and euer¦more
durynge with¦out
ende / and with∣out
begynnynge of
another. and also he
ne may be mesured
ne comprehendid of
man Inough for to
se hym ne his beau∣tes / 
ne may be noumbred / nor his dygne puyssaūce / 
nor maye be taken of any maner entendement so mo∣che
is he puyssaunt and grete. And also he is full of all
bounte mercye and grace. ¶ Mayster may he be no
moo but one onely god. My chylde / nay / For yf there
were many goddes euery of them sholde be all puys∣saunt
&amp; than myght they make thynges contrary cō∣uenable
y<SUP>t</SUP> one to y<SUP>e</SUP> other the whiche is ayenst nature
dyuyne so y<SUP>t</SUP> he ne may be but one substantyue / &amp; one
essence dyuyne the whiche is pryncypall cause effy∣cyent
<PB REF="3"/>
of all thynges and he is y<SUP>e</SUP> soueraygne god vn∣to
the whiche euery herte desyreth to come the which
entendement humayne ne maye comprehende ne I∣magen.
¶ Mayster wherfore is god called father.
My chylde for the engendrement apperteyneth pryn¦cypally
vnto the father more than vnto the mother / 
wherefore man sholde graunte vnto god the moost
pryncypall partye. ¶ Mayster wherfore call we not
the seconde parsone of the trynyte as well doughter
as sone. My chylde for as moche as the sone is of mo¦re
stronge nature / for he toke nature humayne in the
fourme of man and not of woman. ¶ Mayster wher∣fore
is not the holye goost called of the sone and the so∣ne
were called mother. My chylde it is for that / that
he procedeth and dyscendeth also pryncypally of the
one as of the other. ¶ Mayster where was god befo∣re
that he made the worlde. My chylde he was not
in noo place corporell. For nothynge was but he all
onely / but he was in hym selfe father and sone / &amp; ho∣ly
goost in one selfe essence. ¶ Mayster where is he
now. My chylde god occupyeth no place. But his pu¦yssaunce
infynyte is ouerall / for he gouerneth y<SUP>e</SUP> thyn¦ges
the whiche ben in the oryent / and those y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche
ben in the occydent / and generallye all the worlde / 
and therefore a man sayth that he is all tyme and all
thynges. ¶ Mayster knoweth god all thynges. my
chylde / ye: for in lykewyse as he is all puyssaunt also
he is all knowynge and all seynge. ¶ Mayster in
what maner made god the aungelles. my chylde he
them made fayre &amp; shynynge and without body and
full of meruayelous bounte and saiges for to be his
specyall mynystres. ¶ Mayster how synned the aun¦gels
<PB REF="3"/>
that god had made to his semblaunce. My chyl¦de
they yelded not graces vnto god of the grete grace
and souerayne beaute that he had gyuē them / but en¦pryded
thē ī mysknowynge of theyr creature. ¶ Ma∣ster
what came of them. My chylde the moost greate
maysters of them fell in to hell &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> other about vs / &amp;
the other in the ayre. ¶ Mayster wherfore dyscended
they not all togethers in to hell. My chylde for that / 
that the one synned more greuously than the other so
abyde they all aboute vs / and in the ayre for to proue
the holy persones. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne redemed
them Ihesu cryste as these men. My chylde for that
that aungelles ben of more stronge mater &amp; without
body &amp; lynned of theyr owne malyce and wyll w<SUP>t</SUP>out
ony tēptacyon of other / &amp; also for y<SUP>e</SUP> nature angelyke
sholde conuerte theym one tyme alonely vnto good or
vnto euyll / so that whan it is conuerted in to the one
it may be conuertyd into the other by the which they
neuer had done well. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne made
he them that they myght not synne. My chylde to y<SUP>e</SUP>
ende that by their meryte they sholde haue grace and
glory in paradyse. ¶ Mayster whan god wyste that
they sholde synne wherfore made he them. My chyld
for to desteny the good frome the euyll / and to thende
that the good be the moore confermed in bounte / as
the paynter y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche soweth the blacke and of other
euyll coloures amōge them that be fayre for to make
them shewe the more fayre / and in this suffreth god
the euyll amonge the good / &amp; also god maketh the de∣uylles
&amp; hell for to execute and to punysshe the cursed
and myserable synners of this worlde and he made
paradyse and the aungelles for to gloryfye the good.
<PB REF="4"/>
¶ Mayster knoweth the deuylles all thynges. My
chylde of as moche as theyr nature is more spyrytu∣all
than the nature of man / of as moche ben they the
more subtyles and more sages / and knowen all thyn¦ges
paste &amp; p̄sent / but of thynges to come they know
nothynge without it be by some cōiectures as in de∣faulte
of the moone / and of suche semblables / but of
thoughtes of the man they know nothynge / but god
all onely. ¶ Mayster may they do what they wyll / 
My chylde they wyll not do no good / but they maye
do moche yll / &amp; not so moche as they wolde / but that
that god theym suffreth lycenceth to do. ¶ Mayster
the good aūgelles may they synne. My chylde whan
the yll aūgelles fell from paradyse by theyr synne the
good were in suche wyse confermed in good / that se∣then
they haue wylled to doo none euyll. ¶ Mayster
knowe they all thynges / &amp; mayen they all. My chyl∣de
they knowe as I tolde the ryght nowe of the cur∣syd
aungelles &amp; do that / that they wyll / at the wyll &amp;
commaūdemēt of god / 
for ayēst y<SUP>e</SUP> wyll of god
they may do nothynge

MAyster wherfore
dydde god make
men and women. My
chylde for to knowe hȳ
and to loue hym / &amp; for
to fulfyll paradys and
for to put theym in the
places of theym in the
places of the cursed aū∣gelles
in paradyse / the
whiche they haue lost
<PB REF="4"/>
by theyr pryde &amp; mysknowlege. ¶ Mayster wherof
made god the man &amp; the womā. My chylde he made
them of the slyme of the erthe / and knowe thou that
the body humayne is of the foure elementes y<SUP>e</SUP> which
ben the erthe / the water / the ayre / and the fyre / so y<SUP>t</SUP>
the flesshe answereth vnto erthe / the blode vnto the
water / the wynde the ayre / and y<SUP>e</SUP> heete naturall vn∣to
the fyre. And knowe thou also my chylde that the
man is made vnto the semblaunce of the worlde / for
as the skye hath two gretelyghtes the whiche ben y<SUP>e</SUP>
sonne and the moone. Also the man hath two lyght is
in his heed / the whiche ben the two eyen. And as the
skaye hath .vij. planettes / In lykewyse hath y<SUP>e</SUP> man
vij. partycyons in his heed. And as the see receyueth
in it all thynges / In lykewyse the wombe of y<SUP>e</SUP> man
receyueth in hit all thynges necessary vnto the lyfe of
man. And the hardenesse of the stones answereth vn¦to
the bones and vnto the nayles. And vnto the trees
answereth the membres of his bodye. And vnto the
grasse the heres. Knowe thou my chylde that the bo∣dye
of the man is none other thynge but a tree ouer∣throwen
hauynge y<SUP>e</SUP> rotes vpwarde / so that y<SUP>e</SUP> heeres
ben the rotes / &amp; the body is the stocke / and the armes
&amp; the legges ben the braūches. The whiche thynge
sygnyfyeth that we sholde be enroted vpwarde in to
heuen in y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of our creature. ¶ Mayster wherfore
was the woman made of the syde of Adam more so∣ner
than of ony other partye. My chylde yf the wo∣man
had be made of the hyghest party of the mā she
had ben to proude &amp; sholde haue mystaken the man / 
And yf she had ben made of the moost lowest partye
of the man / the man sholde haue to moche dyspray∣sed
<PB REF="5"/>
her. wherfore she was fourmed of the myddle to
thende that y<SUP>e</SUP> man her helde for his cōpany. ¶ May¦ster
wherof made god the soule of the man &amp; of y<SUP>e</SUP> wo∣man.
My chylde he it create vnto his semblaunce / for
the soule is also a substaunce spyrytuall hauynge en∣tendement / 
wyll / and remembraunce. ¶ Mayster
made god the man and the woman with his owne
hādes. My chylde he thē made all onely at his worde
and commaundement. ¶ Mayster wherfore made
god the man of so vyle mater. My chylde to the ende
y<SUP>•</SUP> he were the more humble and to thende that the de∣uyll
be the more confusyd seynge the man made of so
vyse mater to be in paradyse from whens he is fallē
by his pryde. ¶ Mayster wherfore made god the be∣stes.
My chylde god hathe made the good beestes to
thende that man be helped at his nede / and hath ma∣de
the cursed and myscheuous for to abate the pryde
of the man / for whan they noyen hym / he maye well
thynke that he is a lytell thynge as of hymselfe whā
he may not resyst them. Also there be made many be∣stes
for to gyue vs exaumple to lyue as these antes / 
or pysmares / and spyders the whiche contynuallye
trauayleth in theyr operacyons vnto the exaumple
of whom we sholde euermore trauayle / and knowe
that there is not any beest but that hath in him some
marueylous nature whereof we sholde prayse god / 
and also we sholde take exaumple vnto theyr good cō∣dycyons
as sayth y<SUP>e</SUP> holy scrypture that sayth thus.
Respice volatiliaceli. &amp;c. That is to saye beholde the
byrdes of the skye the whiche ben purueyed of the
purueyaunce of god / and haue no drede that god thē
shall euer fayle / but lyue euermore in good hope in
<PB REF="5"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>synge god and in demaundynge of his mercye / 
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whome we sholde take exaumple / and by reason
we sholde do hyt more soner than the beestes that ne
haue wittene vnderstandynge / seynge the grete gra¦ces
that god vnto vs hath done the whiche ben ma∣de
vnto his semblaunce and redemed w<SUP>t</SUP> his precyous
blode / and the whiche gyueth vnto vs soo moche of
good in this worlde. In suche wyse y<SUP>t</SUP> all the beestes
plantes / trees / herbes / lande / &amp; see / planettes / &amp; star∣res / 
and all other thynges ben made for to serue vnto
the man vnto his prouffyte and vtylyte / and yet he
hathe lente vs the realme of paradyse yf we wyll / of
the whiche y<SUP>e</SUP> leest glorye surmounteth all the Ioyes
of this worlde. By the whiche my chylde the man is
wele to blame the whyche mysknoweth his creature
y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche somoche of grace to hym hath done seynge
that the beestes the whiche ne haue wytte / ne vnder∣standynge / 
hym loue and thanke in demaundynge
pyteously his ryghtdygne mercy. ¶ Mayster where
was Adam create. My chylde he was create in ebrō
&amp; after was put in to paradyse terrester. ¶ Mayster
what thȳge is in paradyse terrester / and where is it
My chylde it is a place delectable in the oryont ouer
y<SUP>e</SUP> mountaynes of egypt wherin ben trees of dyuerse
vertues / and of suche there are that who so eteth of
them he shall neuer haue hunger / and of other by na∣ture
shall neuer dye. ¶ Mayster where was the wo∣man
created. My chylde she was created in parady∣se
terrestre / but the man was create w<SUP>t</SUP>out for be put
w<SUP>t</SUP>in in possessyon. ¶ Mayster wherfore synned the
man and the woman. My chylde by the decepcyon of
the deuyl and by theyr folysshe thynkynge trespassed
<PB REF="6"/>
the commaundement of god. ¶ Mayster whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>e it
deceyued the deuyll them. My chylde / by enuy for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> y<SUP>e</SUP>
was full of sorowe of that that they sholde obtayne
his place in paradyse y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche he had lost by his pry¦de.
¶ Mayster in what fourme tempted the ennemy
theym. My chylde / the deuyll appered vnto them in
the fourme of serpent tellynge them that yf they ete
of that fruyte they sholde knowe as moche as god.
¶ Mayster wherfore ne created god the men confer∣med
in grace as the aungelles. My chylde god wolde
that the men were semblable vnto hym as all thyn∣ges
to take of hym / god wolde that all were borne of
Adam. ¶ Mayster why had he not made them that
they myght not haue synned. My chylde to the ende
that they had the more of meryte. ¶ Mayster howe
had they engendred in paradyse terrestre. My chyld
as thou sholdest put thyne one hande w<SUP>t</SUP>in thyn other
without any delectacyon. ¶ Mayster how had these
women chylded. My chylde w<SUP>t</SUP>out any doloure &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦out ordure. ¶ Mayster how had they be in paradyse
terrestre. My chylde as a generacyon gone one after
the other. ¶ Mayster where is paradyse celestyall.
My chylde it is in the tenth heuen the whiche is abo¦ue
all the other heuens and is clepyd the heuyn Im∣peryall
for as moche as it is more clere and more sub∣tyll
in substaunce / &amp; more fayre than all y<SUP>e</SUP> other / In
the whiche bē the holy men &amp; women of paradys en∣braced
w<SUP>t</SUP> the loue of our lorde. ¶ Mayster wherfore
made god man &amp; woman whan he knewe well that
they sholde trespace his commaundement. My chyld
it was for his pleasure so to do for to shewe his infy∣nyte
myght / and vnto the ende y<SUP>t</SUP> he were praysed ser∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="6"/>
&amp; honoured / for all thynges loue god in theyr be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ge
and also for they knewe well y<SUP>•</SUP> there shall be yet
many persones of more gretter meryte &amp; holynes as
if they had not lytell synned / as saynt Iohan baptyst
and y<SUP>e</SUP> apostles &amp; dyscyples of our lorde &amp; many other
for as wytnessyth y<SUP>e</SUP> scripture ryght happy is he that
may do yll / &amp; dothe it not whan he maye. ¶ Mayster
how longe abode Adam &amp; Eue in paradys terrestre.
My chylde frome the mornynge tyll vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> houre of
noone / for at the .iij. houre Adam put the names in y<SUP>e</SUP>
thynges / &amp; about mydday they syn̄ed / &amp; at none they
were banysshed / &amp; at suche houre dyed Ihesu cryste.
¶ Maister in to what place yede Adam whā he was
put out of paradys terrestre. My chylde he yode in to
Ebr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> where he was create / &amp; there engendred he so¦nes
&amp; doughters wherof we ben all comen where he
went longe <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yme his sone Abell that Cayn kylled by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. ¶ Mayster syth y<SUP>t</SUP> the deuyl tēpted Adā &amp; Eue
why were they so greuosly punisshed. My chylde for
that / y<SUP>t</SUP> they mystoke the cōmaundement of god for to
obey to the {per}suacyons of y<SUP>e</SUP> deuyll / &amp; that they ne hel∣de
theym contente w<SUP>t</SUP> god that somoche of grace vnto
them had gyuen. By the whiche they synned in .iij.
maners. That is to vnderstande in pryde whan they
mystoke the cōmaundement of god. And in couetyse
whan they were not contente of y<SUP>•</SUP> / that god vnto thē
had gyuen / and in the synne of the mouthe in etynge
the fruyte that god them had defended. ¶ Mayster
whan y<SUP>t</SUP> he repented hym: &amp; also dyd grete penaunce / 
wherfore was he not restablysshed after his dethe in
his fyrst estate. My chylde for as moche as y<SUP>•</SUP> penaū∣te
was not suffycyent to the reparacyon of all those y<SUP>t</SUP>
<PB REF="7"/>
he had put from paradyse by his synne wherefoore
was necessarye that the seconde persone in trynytee
whiche is the blessyd sone of god made the reparacy¦on
for hym / and how be it that the blessyd god is euer
more mercyfull / he is ryghtwyse and reasonable.
¶ Mayster wherfore sente not god an aungell for to
bye humayne lynage. My chylde for as moche that
yf the aungell had redemyd the man / he had ben sub∣iecte
vnto the aungell and god hath made the man to
be in the state of aungells. And also it was conuena∣ble
sythe the man hadde done the synne that the man
hym repayred / and also my chylde thou sholdest kno∣we
&amp; vnderstande that the blessyd sone of god in pro∣pre
persone wolde repayre the helth and synne of man
and to bere the penaunce and to suffre dethe and passy¦on
ryght dolorous for hym and to humble hym to ta∣ke
our fragylyte and nature in the wombe vyrgynall
for to shewe the grete affeccyon and the greate loue y<SUP>•</SUP>
he hath towarde vs the whiche he made vnto his sem¦blaunce.
¶ Mayster wherfore ne made god that an
aungell toke nature humayne. My chylde for theyse
causes that I haue now telled the / and also for none
aungell ne other creature ne had puyssaunce to open
paradyse but god all onely / &amp; it was close vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> man
by his trespace / wherfore it was of necessyte that the
sonne of god were sente downe here alowe for to rede∣me
nature humayne / and for to open hym paradyse / 
And knowe thou that he hadde in hym two natures.
That is to vnderstande nature dyuyne / for he was
and is very god / and nature humayne / for he was &amp;
is very man / and for as moche vaynquysshed he the
deuyll the whiche had vaynquysshed the man &amp; ope∣ned
<PB REF="7"/>
paradys and was of the lygne of Adam and dyd
for hym penaunce. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne toke the
fader &amp; the holy goost nature humayne as well as y<SUP>e</SUP>
sone. My chylde for that / y<SUP>t</SUP> the sone is the semblaun∣ce
of the fader and graunteth vnto hym all thynges
by the whiche it was a thynge conuenable y<SUP>t</SUP> the sone
all onely drewe vnto hym the man for to drawe hym

The fyrste was
w<SUP>t</SUP>out man &amp; w<SUP>t</SUP>out wo∣man
as Adam. The .ij.
was of a man without
woman as Eue. The
.iij. was of the man and
of y<SUP>e</SUP> woman as we ben
Now was to make the
iiij. maner the which is
of the woman which is
man as is Ihesu cryst. And the other reason is suche
for lykewyse as the dethe come in erthe by y<SUP>e</SUP> woman
the whiche was Eue. Also y<SUP>e</SUP> lyfe came in to the erthe
by the woman. That is to knowe the blessyd Vyr∣gyn
Mary the whiche vs hath borne the frute of ly∣fe
eternall. ¶ Mayster how chylded she. My chylde
she chylded w<SUP>t</SUP>out payne and w<SUP>t</SUP>out dolour and abode
entyer vyrgyn / &amp; pure / &amp; clene from all spotte before
the chyldynge / at the chyldynge / &amp; alter the chyldyn∣ge
<PB REF="8"/>
as the glasse thorowe the whiche y<SUP>e</SUP> sonne passeth
without makynge therin any openynge. But for as
moche as god wolde holde the ordre of nature he abo∣de
nyne monethes in the wombe vyrgynal / &amp; he wal¦ked
not incontynent that he was borne. ¶ Mayster
at what houre was he borne. My chylde he was bor¦ne
at mydnyghte / and at that houre appered in the
skye a starre moche fayre and clere that it was mar∣ueylous
to be holde / the sonne was fayre as y<SUP>e</SUP> golde / 
and peace and vnyte was thorowe oute the worlde / 
and obeyed vnto one onely prynce the which was na¦med
Cesar / &amp; at that houre the dombe beestes spake / 
&amp; Idolles of the sarazyns &amp; paynyms fell to the erthe
¶ Mayster wherefore toke he the gyftes of the thre
kynges. My chylde for in takynge the golde he she∣wed
y<SUP>t</SUP> he was kȳge almyghtly / and by the ensence y<SUP>t</SUP>
he was wery god: &amp; by the myrre very man / and the
kynge the whiche bare the golde was called Baltha¦sar / 
and Iasper bare the myrre / &amp; Melchyor bare the
ensence. ¶ Mayster in howe many maners ben our
synnes pardoned. My chylde they ben pardoned vs
in .v. maners. First by the sacramētes of holy chyrch
y<SUP>•</SUP> whiche ben .vij. that is to knowe baptym / confyr∣macyon / 
confessyon / the order of preesthode / the sacra¦ment
of the auter / the sacrament of mariage / and the
vnccyon / but baptym is the fyrst / &amp; that the whiche
moost clenly putteth oute the synnes / and after bap∣tym / 
confyrmacyon and confessyon ben the moost ne∣cessaryes.
Secondly our synnes vnto vs ben pardo∣ned
by almesdede. Thyrdely by oryson<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> / and by fa∣stynges.
Fourthlye by pardonynge vnto oure enmy∣es / 
&amp; fyfthely by charyte. ¶ Mayster ben all our syn∣nes
<PB REF="8"/>
pardoned by baptym. My chylde ye / for by bap∣tym
we ben as men vnto Iesu cryste in doynge hym
this homade / &amp; we ben delyuered from y<SUP>e</SUP> seruytude
of synne. ¶ Mayster wherfore ben they baptysed the
whiche ben borne of thē y<SUP>t</SUP> ben baptysed / &amp; also y<SUP>e</SUP> chyl∣dren
the whiche haue nothynge offended. My chylde
if any paast were corrupte with venym all the breed
y<SUP>•</SUP> whiche of it sholde be made shold be venymous and
corrupte. And for as moche as our fore fathers were
corrupte by synne they and all theyr <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ygnee were ba∣nysshed
out of paradys terrestre / &amp; vnto theym were
shytte the gate of paradyse celestyall / the whiche ne
may be opened vnto the man / yf he be not first bapty∣sed
as wytnessyth the holy scrypture / and how be it
y<SUP>t</SUP> the father and the mother ben baptysed y<SUP>t</SUP> suffyseth
not vnto the chylde for to be baptysed / for whā a mā
him baptyseth / nature comune ne baptysed hym but
all onely the persone pertyculer / wherfore it is of ne∣cessyte
that we ben all baptysed in pertyculer. ¶ Ma∣ster
wherefore ne named god that all were baptysed
to be saued. My chylde hit is not the deuaute of god
that all ne byn baptysed / for he hath gyuen vnto eue¦ry
man and woman lyberall arbytre and fre wyll y<SUP>•</SUP>
to do. Also baptyme sholde be made of free wyll and
without constraynt for yf god constrayned the man
to be baptysed he had not his lyberall arbytre / and
so all his baptyme had no meryte. ¶ Mayster where¦fore
espouseth not man now his cosynes as in the aū∣cyent
lawe. My chylde hit is for to encreace amyte &amp;
loue betwene straungers / For those the whiche ben
of blode loueth eche other Inoughe more than these
other / wherfore it behoueth for to put loue &amp; charyte
<PB REF="9"/>
where it is not / and the other reason is suche. For the
chyldren had two proximitis togyders as to be sone
and neuew wherfore for honeste it was ordeyned to
make maryage betwene estraungers / but in the olde
lawe men espoused the women of lygnage / &amp; it was
for to multyplye &amp; to encrease y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde. ¶ Mayster
wherfore was Ihesu cryste baptysed. my chylde he
was circumsyzed for to accomplysshe the olde lawe.
and baptyzed for to begyn the new lawe &amp; for to she∣we
his grete humylyte in gyuynge vs example that
we all sholde be regenerate by baptym. ¶ Mayster
wherfore is baptym in water. my chylde for that wa¦ter
is contrary vnto fyre / wherfore for to quenche the
sayd fyre of synne we ben baptysed in water. And in
lykewyse as the water wassheth all ordures and fyl∣thes.
Also the baptym wassheth all synnes / and god
theym establysshed in water for as moche as the wa∣ter
is comune ouer all the worlde to the ende y<SUP>t</SUP> a man
fynde the soner water of y<SUP>e</SUP> sayd sacrament to y<SUP>e</SUP> ende y<SUP>t</SUP>
none ne may excuse hym that he ne coude fynde wher¦of
that he myght make hym to be baptysed or that he
myght haue. ¶ Mayster what worde ought a man
to speke in baptym. My chylde a man oughte to saye
thus. I baptyse the in the name of the father / &amp; of the
sone / and of the holy goost amen. In puttynge thre
tymes of water vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> heed of hym that a man bap∣tyseth / 
and so may they say in all languages / so that
it be in good beleue &amp; in good intencyon &amp; other wor∣des
the whiche ne ben of the necessyte of the sayd sa∣crament
of baptym. ¶ Mayster was it a thynge re∣sonable
that god the fader gaue so noble thynge as is
the sone for to by agayne so caytyf a thynge as is the
<PB REF="9"/>
man. My chylde in that vs sheweth god the father y<SUP>e</SUP>
grete and abūdaunt loue that he hath vnto creature
humayne. ¶ Mayster syth y<SUP>t</SUP> god hath sent downe he¦re
alowe his sonne by so grete charyte and for to re∣deme
y<SUP>e</SUP> humaynes wherfore dyd men to hym so mo∣che
of payne. My chylde Iudas hym betrayed by co∣uetyse.
Pylate him cōdēpnyd for drede to lese his offy¦ce / 
&amp; the Iewes him put to deth by enuy. ¶ Maister
wherfore dyed Ihesu cryste on the tree of the crosse / 
My chylde for as Adam synned by the tree of lyfe. Al¦so
god hym wolde bye agayne by the tree of the crosse
&amp; thou sholdest knowe that by the foure partyes of y<SUP>e</SUP>
crosse the which sheweth all the worlde / it is agayne
shewed vnto vs that the dethe of Iesu cryst was suf∣fycyent
for to bye not onely nature humayne / but al∣so
all the vnyuersall worlde if it had be loste. ¶ May∣ster
how longe abode Ihesu cryste in the erthe deed / 
My chylde he there abode .xl. houres. And whan we
say that he arose the thyrde day / &amp; that in thre dayes
is nor .xl. houres thou sholdest vnderstande that he
dyed the fryday at the houre of noone / and all the sa∣terdaye
he was deed in the holy sepulcre y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche is
the seconde day / and the sonday after he arose ryght
erly / and for as moche as the course of nature is rene∣wed
at mydnyght and the daye / in takynge one par∣tye
of the day for all the day entyer. ¶ Mayster why¦ther
yede the soule of Ihesu cryst whan he was deed
My chylde he yede in to glory towarde god the fader
in yeldynge vnto hym thankes and praysynges in de¦maundynge
hym the holy soules the whiche he had
redemed by the meryte of his holy passyon / the whi∣che
thynge god hym graunted. Than opened the sou¦le
<PB REF="10"/>
of Ihesu cryst the whiche was coniuncte with the
deite the gates of paradys the whiche had ben shyt
by longetyme vnto all humayne lygnage / and y<SUP>e</SUP> sa∣terday
about the houre of mydnyght he descended in
to hell and brake the gates &amp; yede to vysyte his good
frendes. That is to vnderstande the soules of the ho∣ly
auncyent fathers the whiche greatly hym desyred
and theym delyuered frome the pryson of the lymbe
with all the holy soules the which haue meryted pa∣radys
by their holy werkes / and this fayre company
mounted in to heuen and theym presentyd vnto god
the father the whiche them receyued benygnely and
them putteth in to the realme of paradise in y<SUP>e</SUP> places
and syeges that the cursed Aungelles loste by theyr
pryde. And he delyuered not the soules of the damned
as Iudas / and of the cursyd ryche man dyues and of
many other / but theym he lefte in hell in payne and
in turment with all the deuylles without gyuynge
them ony comforte where they ben yet and shalbe for
euer. And on y<SUP>e</SUP> sōday before the sonne rysynge retur∣nyd
the soule vnto the body of Ihesus that lay in the
Sepulcre / and rose from dethe vnto lyfe. ¶ Mayster
wherfore arose not he as soone as he was deed. My
chylde for a man had lytell presumed that he had ben
deed / and he wolde begyn for to renewe the worlde
on the Sonday by his resurreccyon. For at suche an
houre all the worlde began to be. ¶ Mayster where
was he after his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esurreccyon / forty dayes before
his ascencyon. My chylde he was in Paradys terre∣ster.
with Helyas and Enoch in enstructynge theym
y<SUP>•</SUP> which was done as whan he appered. ¶ Mayster
how many tymes apered he. My chylde / he appered
<PB REF="10"/>
fyrst vnto Ioseph of barmathye y<SUP>•</SUP> had buryed hym / 
y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche for so doynge was put in pryson. After vn∣to
his mother: after to the blessyd Mawdeleyne: af∣ter
vnto the .ij. pylgrymes comynge from the holy se¦pulcre:
after to saynt Iames the whiche wolde not
ete tyll that he had seen hym. After vnto saynt Peter
after to the two pylgrymes y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche went to the ca¦stell
of malux after he appered vnto his dyscyples y<SUP>e</SUP>
gates shytte: after vnto saynt Thomas whan he put
his hande in the syde of our lorde Ihesu cryste: after
vnto his dyscyples in the see of Tyberyon / and so my
chylde thou shold vnderstāde y<SUP>t</SUP> our lorde Ihesu cryst
appered .xij. tymes before that he ascendid in to heuē
¶ Mayster who ascēdyd in to heuen with hym. My
chylde the Soules of the blessyd the whiche than by
theyr merytes were saued / and also grete multytude
of aungelles of heuen y<SUP>e</SUP> which hym accompanyed in
syngynge melodyously &amp; yeldynge thankes vnto god
¶ Mayster wherefore abode he .xl. dayes to mounte
in to heuen after that he was rysen. My chylde for y<SUP>•</SUP>
that he gaue grete payne .xl. houres whan he abode
in the erth vnto his frendes &amp; dyscyples wherfore he
wolde cōforte them .xl. dayes / that is one day for eue∣ry
houre in tokenynge y<SUP>t</SUP> for payne he gyueth greate
Ioye / &amp; also he dyd it for to conferme them in the ho∣ly
faythe / as saynt Thomas &amp; other / vnto whom he
apperyd vysybly. ¶ Mayster what is that to say / y<SUP>t</SUP>
the sone is sette on the right hande of his father. My
chylde it is to saye that y<SUP>e</SUP> humanyte is in glory with
the dyuynyte. ¶ Mayster in what maner and forme
ascendyd Ihesu cryste in to heuen. My chylde he sty∣ed
in to heuen in suche fourme and maner as whan
<PB REF="11"/>
he hym transfygured before some of his dyscyples in
the mountayne of Tabor that is to vnderstande that
he had the armes stretched &amp; lyfte vp in heyght / and
his face shynynge as the sonne. And his vestemētes
were whyte as snowe / and a fayre and clere clowde
descendynge from heuen / &amp; it closed roūde about hym
and so mountyd in to heuen in suche wyse y<SUP>t</SUP> they lost
the syght corporall of hym. ¶ Mayster wherfore is y<SUP>e</SUP>
sacrament of the awter made of breed / and of wyne
My chylde for as the grayne of the corne hath ben be¦ten
and flayled and had the sede clouen In lykewyse
the precyous body of Ihesus was beten &amp; scourged / 
and had the syde opened / out of y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche Issued blo∣de
and water / wherfore men put water vnto the sayd
sacrament. And as the wyne lepeth from y<SUP>e</SUP> grape by
force of the wryngyuge in the pressour. In lykewyse
the precyous blode of Iesus lepte from his precyous
body on the pressour of y<SUP>e</SUP> crosse / and it was not esta∣blysshed
of the flesshe nor of the bloode for a man may
horrour to drynke blode and to ete flesshe / but it was
establysshed of breed and wyne / that is the moost co∣mune
refeccyon that is / and also the breed / and the
wyne ben the moost comune and the moost profyta∣ble
for to nourysshe the body. In lykewyse the sacra∣mente
of the awter is the mooste commune / and the
moost profytable refeccyon for to nourysshe the sou∣le.
¶ Mayster howe shall we vnderstande that hit
is the holy bodye of Ihesu cryste and his precyouse
bloode vnder the kynde of breed and of wyne. My
chylde as the breed and the wyne that thou eatys &amp;
drynkest conuerte theym in to thyne owne bodye and
in to thyn owne bloode. In lykewyse the sacrament
<PB REF="11"/>
of the awter the breed and the wyne sayenge the holy
wordes by the wyll of god / also chaungeth them vn∣to
the precyous body and blode of Ihesu cryste. And
also he wolde do it for the grete loue that he hathe in
vs he wolde euermore be with vs. And it is in his po¦wer
that to do / as of nothynge he hath made all the
worlde y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche is a more grete thynge. Than my
chylde thou sholdest beleue stedfastly and withoute
doubte for his pleasure was hit to instytute in suche
wyse. And how be it that thou seest it not corporally / 
for a body gloryfyed is inuysyble thou hast the more

My chyld / they cru¦cyfye
of newe oure

¶ Mayster y<SUP>e</SUP>
preest that is īmor∣tall

preest it doth vnto his dampnacyō / and yf he be with
out synne it is vnto his saluacyon. ¶ Mayster howe
longe abydeth the body of Ihesu cryste in the wom∣be
of hym the whiche hym receyueth. My chylde he
there abydeth as longe as the substaūce of the breed
there may amyde vndegested and no more / but thou
shalt vnderstande that god there is and also abydeth
euermore with theym the whiche ben in the state of
grace. ¶ Mayster / whā many prestes syngeth masse
the bodye of cryste is it ouer all / My chylde / ye / For
god is and maye be ouer all as thy soule the whiche
is hoole in euerye partye of the bodye. ¶ Mayster
shold a man hate the yll. My chylde a man sholde ha∣te
theyr cursydnes and folyes and not to do euyll as
they done / but we sholde loue oure nature / for we be
all y<SUP>e</SUP> sones of one father and of one mother &amp; bought
and redemed with one selfe blode / and if they doo the
ony wronge thou sholdest pardon them and praye for
theym vnto the example of Ihesu cryst / the whiche
prayed for them that him crucyfyed and put vnto the
dethe. For it is the werke mooste merytoryous that
we maye do. ¶ Mayster wherfore haue the euyll so
many of goodes and of prosperytees in this worlde.
My chylde there is not so yll in this worlde but that
somtyme dothe some good dede. And for as moche as
man dyde neuer any good dede but that it were recō∣pensed / 
nor neuer dyd euyll but that hit be punysshed
And for this cause god them sendeth of grete goodes
&amp; prosperytees in retrybucyon of theyr good dede / &amp;
so vnto them gyueth puyssaunce &amp; auctoryte vpon y<SUP>e</SUP>
<PB REF="12"/>
good to the ende y<SUP>•</SUP> the good ben proued by them / and
sometyme god sendeth trybulacyon vnto the yll / to
thende that they amende them / and yf they do it not
neuerthelesse that shall be in dymynucyō of theyr syn¦nes
that they shold suffer &amp; haue in hell. Or they shal
haue encreasynge of other grete goodes temporals / 
but god gyueth of trybulacyons &amp; aduersytees vnto
the good for to proue them as vnto Iob / &amp; vnto Tho∣bye
to the ende y<SUP>•</SUP> they dyspraysed the vanytes of this
worlde / &amp; that they sholde not forgete theyr creature
and that by theyr merytes in takynge all in pacyence
they may haue the glorye of paradyse / and somtyme
god theym gyueth of goodes to thende y<SUP>t</SUP> they be the
more charytable and that they augment in glorye in
paradys. The good dyeth somtyme anone to the en∣de
that they empeyre not for to auoyde the perylles &amp;
temptacyons the which ben in this worlde / and also
y<SUP>e</SUP> good lyueth somtyme longely for to encreace theym

for god taryeth that they sholde amende them / and so
thou sholde vnderstande my chylde y<SUP>t</SUP> the opynyon of

that he may fynde hym. For god wyll not ne also suf∣freth
not the dethe &amp; dāpnacion of a man / but wylleth
that conuerte hym &amp; lyue eternally in paradys / and
how be it that many dyeth sodeynly &amp; w<SUP>t</SUP>out hauyng

<PB REF="13"/>
How be it vnto suche purpose may they dye and in so

as they be the more sage and y<SUP>e</SUP> more dygne of as mo∣che
shall they be the better rewarded whā they shall

¶ Mayster maye god do euyll. my chylde / nay: for
how be it that he be all puyssaunt / neuerthelesse it is
not entendyd that he may do thynges contrarye vn∣to
reason / and that they ben Impossyble for to be.
¶ Mayster wherfore suffreth god y<SUP>t</SUP> the beestes haue
so moche of payne / and also they haue not deserued it
my chylde it is somtyme that by y<SUP>e</SUP> synne of the man
the vengeaūce of god falleth vpon the beestes &amp; vpon
theyse other goodes to the ende that he amende hym
or for to proue hym as Iob. And also than beestes bē
made to susteyne &amp; to nourisshe the man by y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche
they ben vnder his subieccyon. And also for all thyn∣ges
sholde serue vs to that wherunto they ben ordey∣ned / 
as the brydge the whiche is made to passe / or to

thende that therby we take example / for syth that y<SUP>e</SUP>
beestes suffreth so moche of payne for theyr poore lyfe
corporall / we shold well more trauayle and take pay¦ne
to gete the lyfe eternall of paradys in the whiche
a man shall lyue eternallye. ¶ Mayster knoweth
god whether that a man shall be saued or dampned
before that he be borne. My chylde yes / not that god
it dothe in entencyon for to dampne hym / for god ne
dampnyth hym but y<SUP>e</SUP> man dampnith hymselfe with
<PB REF="13"/>
out ony constraynt but of his owne wyll the whiche
is at his owne lyberall arbytre or fre wyll. As we se
the boterflye y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche of hym selfe and of his propre
wyll hym brēneth in the candell. And how be it that
the sayde boterflye is sometyme scalded w<SUP>t</SUP> the fyre of
the candell in suche wyse that often he falleth vnto y<SUP>e</SUP>
erthe / also he ryseth agayn the best wyse he can / and
with all his power he putteth hymselfe agayne in y<SUP>e</SUP>
fyre of the candell all holly that he there abydeth / not
withstandynge that he seeth well the daungere. Also
done those the whiche dampneth themselfe / for how
be it that they se and knowe the daunger that therin
is / and also that they ben often scalded by trybulacy∣ous / 
and aduersytees to thende that they conuert thē
and that by inspyracyon dyuyne they haue some re∣mors / 
how be it for that they cease not tyll vnto that / 
that of theyr owne wyll &amp; w<SUP>t</SUP>out ony constraynt they
put them so depe in y<SUP>e</SUP> fyre that they there abyde and
shall neuer go forthe. And how be it that good wyll of

a gyfte as the realme of paradys without ony mery∣te / 
and by suche wyse my chylde knowe thou y<SUP>t</SUP> god
hath made y<SUP>e</SUP> man not to thende that he be dampned
but to thende that by his holy operacyōs in suffryng
pacyentlye trybulacyons and aduersytees / and in re¦systynge
and fyghtynge valyauntlye ayenst the de∣uyll / 
the worlde and the flesshe / he may meryte to be
saued. ¶ Mayster those y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche ben predestynate
to be saued may they be saued without deseruynge it
&amp; to trauayle therefore. My chylde nay / for god kno∣with
well that by theyr merytes and trauayles they
shall be saued. And in lykewyse may a man say of the

dampnyd. ¶ Mayster syth that those the whiche bē

those y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche shold be dampned may they be sauyd
what auayleth it elles so moche to trauayle for to ha∣ue
paradys or hell. My chylde if thou be predestyna∣te
to be saued in the glorye eternall thou sholdest not
encrease thy paynes in purgatory / &amp; to lesse thy glory
in paradys by faute to do well / &amp; yf thou be predesty∣nate
to be dāpned thou sholdest not therfore euermo∣re
lyue in synne / but thou sholdest euermore enforce y<SUP>e</SUP>
to do well / &amp; to do penaunce for to lesse thy paynes in

paradys celestyall / paradyse terrestre / and paradys

In that paradys ben our good aūgelles y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche se¦eth

these other / and there abyde more longely than the o∣ther

humayne y<SUP>e</SUP> which can comprehēde ne Ima∣gen
as of fyre stynkynge and ryght brennynge / of to∣des /

&amp; of deuylles enraged &amp; wode the whiche neuer
ben wery for to bete &amp; tourment the poore &amp; mysera∣ble
dāpned / but euermore ben for to begynne in suche
wyse that the leest payne of hell surmounteth all the
paynes of this world / but the one is more punysshed
than the other after their desert / and at the day of Iu¦gement
theyr payne shall doubte / for than they shall
aryse &amp; shall be dampned in body &amp; in souse. ¶ May∣ster
what payne haue the soules of the Innocentes y<SUP>•</SUP>
which dyeth w<SUP>t</SUP>out baptym. My chylde they ne haue
payne / ne doloure / ne Ioye / ne gladnes. For they ne∣uer
dyd good nor euyll / by y<SUP>e</SUP> which they haue not me∣ryted
to haue ony good / ne to haue ony euyll &amp; howe
be it y<SUP>t</SUP> the place wherin they ben be dym &amp; derke. All
be it there is nothynge the which them greueth / and
whan the day of Iugement shall come that they shal
ryse they shall be of the aege that oure lorde Ihesu
cryste was whan he dyed on the tre and all the other.
Also the sayd chyldren not baptysed shall be contente

in to theyr sayd place without euer to haue Ioy ne he¦uynes
no more than thou hast of that / y<SUP>e</SUP> thou hast no

for thou knowest well thou arte not he the

the gloryous realme of Paradyse for they ben exyled
by y<SUP>e</SUP> synne of Adā &amp; of Eue / of the whiche synne they
haue not ben purged by baptyme. ¶ Mayster those
of paradys se they those of hell. My chylde ye / and y<SUP>•</SUP>
vnto them is a grete encreasynge of glory whan they
se the paynes y<SUP>t</SUP> they haue escaped wherof they than∣ke
god without ceasyng / and also the dampned seeth
the saued in paradys as we haue in the gospell of the
cursed ryche man Dyues the whiche sawe the soule
of the poore Lazare in the bosome of Abraham in pa∣radys / 
the whiche thynge is to them a grete encrea∣synge
of theyr doloure &amp; anguysshe whan they se the
grete goodes spyrytuall that they haue lost by theyr
synnes &amp; by theyr neclygēce / &amp; after the day of Iuge∣mente
as the bodyes of the saued shall be gloryfyed / 
they shall se the dāpned corporally / but the dampnyd
may not se them corporally. ¶ Maister ben the saued
wroth of the payne of the dampned. My chylde they
that ben in paradys wolde well that those the which
ben in hell hadde soo well lyued whan they were in
this worlde / that by theyr holy werkes they had ben
saued with them. For without ceasynge they praye
for the humaynes lyuynges within this p̄sent world
but sythen that they by their cursyd lyfe and by theyr
Synnes they ben dampned for euer / theyse of para∣dyse
neyther ben heuy nor dysplesaunt. For in Para∣dyse
there is not of heuynes / nor of dyspleasaunce of
ony manes thynge. But all Ioye / myrthe / and glad∣nesse
without ende. ¶ Mayster the auncient fathers
suffred they ony maner of payne in the lymbe of hell
<PB REF="19"/>
My chylde nay / but all onely that they were holden
in derkenes and in captyuyte. And were put from the
vysyon of god and aboue euermore theyr delyueraū∣ce.
¶ Mayster what knowlege haue the Iuste the
whiche ben in paradys. My chylde they knowe the
good &amp; theyr merytes &amp; of the cursyd also / and y<SUP>e</SUP> cur∣knoweth
wherfore they ben dampned / &amp; knoweth
as we that thynge that they se and feele. And those of
purgatory ne knoweth nothynge of this worlde / yf
it be not by reuelacyon of aūgels y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche them cō∣forteth
or of y<SUP>e</SUP> sayntes of paradys. These of paradys
sheweth theym whan they wyll / and vnto whome
they wyll / but the dampned shall neuer come forthe
of hell tyll vnto the daye of Iugement that they shal
come to take agayne theyr bodyes and to here the sen¦tence
of the soueraygne Iuge / &amp; after they shall retur¦ne
in to hell from whens they shall neuermore retur∣ne.
And if that it happen somtyme that it semeth vn∣to

as mē sayth on many / but it is not at ther wyll
ne they be not eased of theyr paynes. For they bere e∣uermore
theyr hell with them / and so they ben euer
more in hell. ¶ Mayster how say ye of these women
the which sayth that they them se in the ayre of these
feyryes / and of these gobelyns the whiche them cal∣leth
elues / and many other thynges. My chylde the
women ben moost varyables and more lyght of bele∣ue

and therfore the deuyll shewed more soner his vysy∣ons
vnto women than he dyd vnto men / how be hit

&amp; for as moche that some women ben of more lyghte
beleue of as moche the more the deuyll sheweth of vy¦syons
