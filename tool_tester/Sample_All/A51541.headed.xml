<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O Expatiate in En∣comiums on the Ma∣thematicks, were to Gild Gold; an Undertaking vain and impertinent. This sort of Learning has sufficiently justifi'd its Excellency, both from the Certainty of its Principles, and Use∣fulness of its Practise, to all Ingenious Men.</P>
<P>Nor had the number of its Vota∣ries been so few as they are, had not the difficulty of the Terms (some <HI>Ara∣bick,</HI> most <HI>Greek,</HI> and divers of them <HI>Latine,</HI> according as they have
<PB REF="5"/>
been derived to us from the most Learned of those respective Nations, in several Ages) deterr'd many of great Natural Parts from wading in∣to its Mysteries, or at least clowded its ravishing Beauties from their Eyes.</P>
<P>To remedy this, and at once promote such Praise-worthy and advantagious Arts, and serve the young Students therein, I have taken the pains to Collect and Explain the Hard Words, Difficult Terms, and Abstruse Phrases used by Authors, in all the several Mathematical Sciences, and Branches depending thereupon; than which, nothing has hitherto more discouraged hopeful <HI>Tyro's</HI> from Proficiency.</P>
<P>But here is offered them a Key, that will open to them the choicest Treasures of <HI>Urania,</HI> and her Sub∣lunary Handmaids: Nay, We have taken care to demonstrate the Na∣ture of the Things, as well as genu∣ine
<PB REF="5"/>
Sence of the Words; and to rivet them in the Understanding, have ac∣commodated the Senses with Demon∣strative Diagrams, where they are requisite.</P>
<P>If any useful Terms have escaped our diligence, let the Reader consi∣der the Nature of the Work, impossi∣ble to be begun and perfected at once: for we were forced to trace an almost Untrodden-Path.</P>
<P>If any Errors have been commit∣mited in the Interpretation (as who in such Variety dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ pretend to a full and perfect understanding how, and in what sence every Author has used a Word) let Imbecility of Judgment, or Defect of Memory be pardoned, but zealous good will for propagating of Arts be encouraged, which was never more cordially designed than in this Work: But the performance is submitted to the Charity of thy Cen∣sure.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>A main thing which induced me to this Undertaking, was from Expe∣rience, how much such a Work was wanting: For about thirty years ago, when I first began to apply my self to Mathematical Learning, I found my self not a little perplex'd with the difficult Terms used by Au∣thors, and therefore then began to Collect such hard Words as I met with, that I might either by my Reading, or Enquiry of some of my Mathematical Acquaintance, learn to know the meaning of them. Thus have I ever since been storing up Words and their Interpretations, with <HI>Memorandums</HI> in what Book and Folio I might find their Definitions or Explanations, against I should be ready to digest them into an Alpha∣betical Method; which at last (though long first) I did, and intend∣ed then speedily to have finished this Book. But finding my self encum∣bred
<PB REF="6"/>
in many other Concerns, I con∣sidered the Task would be too tedious for me to run through alone, and therefore desired the assistance of my good Friend, Mr. <HI>H. C.</HI> by whose pains it is at last arrived to what you see.</P>
<P>It is true, that since this was, as aforesaid, Collected, I did light on <HI>Vitalis,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Author, Printed in Latin; and by comparing my Colle∣ctions and his Book, I found I had ga∣thered more Words <HI>purely Mathema∣tical,</HI> than he had done: But he hath indeed inserted the Names of most Stars, and upon them made somewhat long Discourses; which, before I saw his Book, I had also Collected: But upon consideration, that it would make this Book swell beyond its in∣tended Size, and that they would prove of small vse to <HI>English</HI> Begin∣ners, I left them out.</P>
<P>Having given thee this Account,
<PB REF="7"/>
it onely remains to advertize thee a word or two for thy better apprehensi∣on of the scope of the Book.</P>
<P>First, Consider, 'Tis intended for Beginners, not Accomplish'd Artists, therefore adapted to the meanest Ca∣pacities; preferring sometimes a Plain, Familiar, and Intelligible De∣scription, before a Rigid, Abstruse (though Exact) Definition: Nay, rather (though rarely) venturing up∣on a Repetition, than running the hazard of not being understood.</P>
<P>Secondly, Observe, We have in most places hinted the Derivation of the Word, which both assists the Me∣mory, and informs the Understand∣ing: yet have put the <HI>Greek</HI> words in <HI>English</HI> Characters; for those that understand <HI>Greek</HI> know them well enough now; but those that do not, could not perhaps have read them otherwise, so much as to have perceiv∣ed any Analogy between them and
<PB REF="7"/>
the Words, we say owe their Original to them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Letter <HI>G.</HI> or sometimes <HI>Gr.</HI> shows the Word Originally <HI>Greek;</HI> and <HI>L.</HI> or <HI>Lat. Latin.</HI> And what is included between these two [] Crot∣chets, is the natural, strict, and pro∣per Signification of the Word; what follows is the Mathematical acception: and in that where I have been forc'd to use any hard Word, I have ex∣plain'd it by another Synonymous (of the same signification) in a Parenthe∣sis immediately following.</P>

<LABEL><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Bscission</HI> [or cutting off] <HI>of Light,</HI></LABEL>
<ITEM><P>from the Latin word <HI>Abscindo,</HI> to cut from, is a term in Astrology, and signi∣fies a weakning of a Planet, which happens when three Planets are within the bounds of their Orbs, and the middle∣most is a <HI>weighty</HI> Planet; to which another lighter, being in fewer degrees of the Sign, applies; and the third being in more degrees, separates from it: But before the first, moving Direct, comes to be corporally joyned with the said <HI>ponde∣rous</HI> Planet, the third becoming in the mean time Retrograde, does thereby come up before it to the said middle Planet: Then is the third said to <HI>cut off the light</HI> of the first. It may likewise happen another way, that is, when the middle Planet ap∣plies to a conjunction with the last; but the first being <HI>lighter,</HI> (that is, more <HI>swift</HI> in motion) pas∣ses him, and comes <HI>first</HI> to a conjunction with the Planet which he is tending unto.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Absis,</HI> or Apsis;</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>a Latin word, signifying pro∣perly, the bowing, or hollow arch of an Oven;
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
but amongst Astronomers 'tis used as well for the <HI>highest part</HI> of the Circle; to which, when a Pla∣net comes, it is at the greatest <HI>distance from the earth;</HI> as the <HI>lowest</HI> part thereof, when he is the <HI>nearest to the Earth</HI> that he can be. The first is call'd, the <HI>Apogaeum:</HI> The second, the <HI>Perigaeum</HI> of a Planet. By the mutation of these <HI>Absides,</HI> or points, and their passing from one Sign to another, Astrologers pretend to discover the <HI>Revolutions</HI> of States, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Absolute Equation,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>is the aggregate or sum of the Excentrique and Optique Equations; and therefore it is called the Absolute or Compound Equation.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Accidents;</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Astrologers by this term mean the most remarkable chances that have happened to a man in the course of his life: As a grand sickness at such a year: An extraordinary fortune such a year: An eminent danger at such a time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By these, where they have not the true, but only the estimate time when a person was born, they find out the true hour and minute of the Native's birth, as exactly as they could have found out at what age such accidents should have happened to him, had the true time of birth been given them.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL><HI>Accidental Dignities</HI> and <HI>Debilities</HI></LABEL>
<ITEM><P>are certain casual affections of the Planets, whereby they are streng∣thened or weakned, by reason of being in such a house of the Figure, or the like. As a Planet in the mid-Heaven has five Accidental Dignities: In the 12th house as many Accidental Debilities. They are called Accidental, because they are suddenly altered, and in contra-distinction to Essential Forti∣tudes and Debilities: As when a Planet is in his own
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
House, or in his fall. The Table of the Planets essen∣tial dignities is common in Mr. <HI>Lillie's</HI> Almanack. That of their Accidental Fortitudes and Debilities, you have in his Introduction, <HI>p.</HI> 115.</P></ITEM>

<ITEM><P>From a Greek word <HI>Acronychos;</HI> signifying, of, or belonging to the evening, is one of the remarkable manners of the Rising or Setting of Stars, and different both from Cosmical, or He∣liacal: For when a Star rises when the Sun Sets, 'tis said to Rise Acronycally; and when it Sets when the Sun Sets, 'tis said to Set Acronycally.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Acute Angle,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Is an Angle less than a Right An∣gle, or less than 90 degrees, and therefore called Acute, that is, sharp: As in <HI>Scheme</HI> 1. the Angle O. A. B. containing but 40 degrees, is an Acute An∣gle.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Addition</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>is one of the five vulgar Rules of Arithmetick; and is no more but a putting toge∣ther, or collection of two or more numbers into one.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Aera,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>A Latin word, and sometimes from the Greek, called <HI>Epocha,</HI> is the beginning of an ac∣count of Time, founded on some extraordinary ac∣cident. As we Christians reckon from the Birth of our Saviour: The old Romans, from the founda∣tion of their City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence the Birth of Christ, or the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> is called the Aera of our or their account.</P></ITEM>

<LABEL>Alcochoden,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>or the Giver of Life; is a Planet that disposes of, or has dignities in the Hylegiacal (or principal) places of the Figure when a person is born; and according to his condition, so may the Natives life be expected to be longer or shor∣ter.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Aldebaran,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>The name of a Royal Fixed Star in the 4th degree of <HI>Gemini,</HI> within almost three degrees of South Latitude, of the nature of <HI>Mars,</HI> and so violent, that Astrologers say, being with the Luminaries, or <HI>Saturn</HI> or <HI>Mars,</HI> especially in the Ascendant, he threatens an untimely or violent death.</P></ITEM>

<ITEM><P>is a word seldom used by English Au∣thors, but signifies only the Label or Index that moves upon the Centre-pin of an Astrolabe.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Aliquot parts,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>are the even or equal Numbers that may be had out of any great Number; As 6. 4. 3. 2. 1, are severally Aliquot parts of 12; be∣cause six may be had twice in 12. Four may be had thrice in 12. Three may be had four times in 12. Two may be had six times in 12. And One, twelve times.</P></ITEM>

<LABEL>Altern Base,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>A term used in Trigonometry, distinguishing from the true Base: As thus; in ob∣lique Triangles the true Base is always either the sum of the Sides, (and then, the difference of the Sides is called <HI>the Altern Base,</HI>) or the true Base is the difference of the Sides, and then the sum of the
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
Sides is called the Altern Base. As in the Oblique Triangle, A D E (in Scheme 2.) A C is the sum, and A F the difference of the Sides D E and D A; A E is the true Base, and A I the Alternate Base, ac∣cording to <HI>Norwood.</HI></P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Altitude,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>[Lat. Height,] the Sun, Moon, Stars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being any number of <HI>degrees</HI> above the Hori∣zon, are said to have so many degrees of Alti∣tude.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Amblygonium,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>From the Greek <HI>Ambluys,</HI> blunt, or obtuse, and <HI>Gonia,</HI> an Angle; is a term in Geometry, and signifies a Triangle, that hath one of its Angles obtuse, that is, greater than a Right Angle. See Angle.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Amblygon,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>is of the same derivation and sig∣nification, but used for an obtuse Cone, <HI>viz.</HI> A Cone whose Axis is shorter than the Radius of its Base.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Amphiscii,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>(From the Greek <HI>Amphi,</HI> on either side, and <HI>Scia,</HI> a shadow, or, in English, people of <HI>double shadows</HI>) are the Inhabitants of those Re∣gions under the Equator, or between the Tropicks of <HI>Cancer</HI> and <HI>Capricorn,</HI> because their shadows are cast sometimes towards the North, and sometimes towards the South, according to the Sun's different course; such are the people of the Golden <HI>Cherso∣nesus,</HI> or <HI>Malacha</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> the Isle of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> the middle of the Isle of St. <HI>Laurence, &amp;c.</HI></P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Amplitude,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Lat. signifies the space or number of degrees contained between the East or West point of the Horizon, and the Rising or Setting of the Sun, Moon, or any Star; or if the Sun, Moon, or Star be above the Horizon, then so many de∣grees as are contained between the Azimuth of the

<ITEM><P>A branch of the Opticks, cal∣led also Catoptrics, a Science, which by the Rays of some luminous object, reflected on a plain super∣ficies, partly obscure, and partly diaphanous, con∣siders, and finds out its form, affections, greatness, distance, and the like.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Anaclatics,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Are also part of the Opticks, which by the lines of the Stars, and other visual objects, refracted in a medium of different thickness, mea∣sures their figures, magnitudes, distances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Analemma,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Gr. [properly the Firmament, but used for] A plain Projection of the Sphere, called al∣so the Orthographical Projection, where the Sphere is cut into two Hemispheres, and the Eye placed at an infinite distance vertically to one of the Hemi∣spheres, then a right line extended from the Eye to any assigned point in the Sphere, called Surface of that Hemisphere, shall project the assigned point upon the plain, and the distance upon the plain from the Apex, or top of the Hemisphere, to the projected point, is equal to the sine of the Arch from the ver∣tex of the Hemisphere to the assigned point, the Radius being the Semidiameter of the Sphere. See the Description and Use of the English Globe, <HI>sect.</HI> 6.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Analysis,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Gr. [A resolution, unfolding, or untwisting of a Matter, Argument, or Problem;] Whence the Adjective <HI>Analytical,</HI> done▪ or doing, by way of opening, or resolving.</P></ITEM>

Analogie,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Gr. [Proportion, or like compari∣son;] but in Mathematicks 'tis a double compa∣rison, or proportion of Numbers or Magnitudes one to another: As when we say, as 4 is to 2, so is 8 to 4. Hence <HI>Analogicai,</HI> proportionate, or alike.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Anareta,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>Is a Greek word, and signifies, <HI>A cutter off;</HI> and therefore Astrologers use it for the killing Planet, or Planet threatning death in a Na∣tivity, which is usually the Lord of the Eighth, or one posited near the Cusp of the <HI>8th. &amp;c.</HI></P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Angle,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>In Geometry, the meeting of two Lines make an Angle. As in Scheme 1, A is an Angle, so is B and C, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus B is the Angle of the sides B A and B C; and C is the Angle of C A and C B. Thus the meeting of two <HI>Walls</HI> in a Building makes a <HI>Corner,</HI> (call'd in Latin <HI>Angulus,</HI> whence this term of Art is derived.) An Angle is either <HI>Right, Acute,</HI> or <HI>Obtuse.</HI> A <HI>Right Angle</HI> is, when a Right Line falls perpendicularly upon an∣other Right Line, so as it leaves an equal space on either side: for where it so touches the other Line, it makes two <HI>Right Angles.</HI> As in Scheme 3, the line B A makes two Right Angles at A, on the line D A C.

<ITEM><P>These terms are chiefly used by Physitians; but since they can∣not be found out but by Astro∣nomy, we shall here briefly explain them. <HI>Crisis</HI> is used for a sudden change of a Disease into better or worse, Life or Death; and because by experi∣ence it hath been found that such changes happen for the most part regularly at such and such times; Hence they call those days <HI>Critical days,</HI> which are commonly believed to be every 7th day, by reason of I know not what kind of vertue in that number:
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
but the truth is, the reason of those Conflicts be∣tween Nature and the Disease, is the Moons coming to the Quadratures, Opposition, or Radical place, where she was at the beginning of the sickness; and one of these generally happens about the 7th day; but as the Moon is swifter, or slower in mo∣tion, it often comes sooner or later. Therefore the discreet Physitian ought to consult <HI>Ephemerides,</HI> without which they cannot give any true or ra∣tional Account of their observing these Critical days: For the better doing it, they should Erect a Scheme with 16 Houses; the form whereof you have in Mr. <HI>Culpeper's Semiotica Uranica.</HI></P></ITEM>

More plainly, It is the Circle where the Heavens and Earth seem to meet, as far off as you can see when you turn your self about at Sea, or in an open field: And above which, when the Sun or any Star comes▪ 'tis said to Rise; when it goes below it, to Set. But yet more particularly, the Horizon is to be considered two manner of ways.</P>
<P>First, the Natural Horizon.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Mathematical Horizon.</P>
<P>The first is that apparent Circle we have just now described. But the second, which is oftner made use of in the Doctrine of the Sphere and Astronomy, Is a great Circle which divides that part of Heaven which we call above us, from that which is counted under us, precisely into two equal parts, whose Poles are the <HI>Zenith</HI> and <HI>Nadir;</HI> and in which Cir∣cle, the <HI>Azimaths,</HI> or Vertical Circles are numbred; and likewise by it our Days and Nights measured out unto us; for whilst the Sun is above the Ho∣rizon, it is Day; and when under, Night.</P></ITEM>

And since the same has a very great signification of the Constitution, Corporature, and Manners of a Native, 'tis used in Authors sometimes for the General Fate of a Man's Life.

Hence it comes to pass, that when 4 Numbers have proportion one to the other, the Sum of the Logarithm of the first and last shall be equal to the Sum of the 2 middle ones. As for Example, take two Numbers, 4 and 8, where one is as big again as the other. Hence the like pro∣portion shall be between all Numbers doubly as big as each other: As between 5 and 10, 12 and 24, 24 and 48, 50 and 100, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore the Logarithms of the Numbers, 4 and 10, 4 and 24, 4 and 48, 4 and 100, added together, will be equal to the Aggregate of the Logarithms, 8 and 5, 8 and 12, 8 and 24, 8 and 50, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The use of these Logarithms is very excellent, both for ease and saving of time; for whatever can be done by the Golden Rule by a wearysome Calculation, and tedious Circuit through Multiplication and Divi∣sion, that a 4th Number unknown, may be found out from 3 known; this by Logarithms is per∣formed at one single operation: For if 2 Numbers be to be multiplied, take their Logarithms, and you have your intent only by Addition: If to be divi∣ded,
<PB N="78" REF="47"/>
you need onely use Substraction. For example,
<TABLE>

<CELL>3, 031408</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE>
Would you multiply 43 by 25; set down those Numbers, and against them set their respe∣ctive Logarithms. So the Logarithm of 43 is 1, 633468; of 25 is 1, 397940, which added, make 3, 031408.

But what Planet this shall be, is con∣troverted: for <HI>Julius Firmicus,</HI> a celebrated Au∣thor, that flourish'd about 320 years after Christ, would have it to be the Lord of that Sign into which the Moon enters next after the Birth, ex∣cept onely the Luminaries, as being universal Sig∣nificators. But we must note this Author to be a bet∣ter Latinist than Astrologer; and the sounder opi∣nion is, To constitute that Planet of the Five, Lord, that being in fit Places, shall have most Dignities in the places of the Luminaries, the Ascendant, the Mid-Heaven, and part of Fortune.</P></ITEM>

that the Star has to the Earth. Besides, it has place, in a Ray obliquely cast, or when a Star, not being Vertical, projects his Beams, as it were, on one side, and so to the Centre and Superficies of the Earth: For when 'tis Vertical, casting its Beams directly to the Superficies, it must needs pass by the Centre which is just under, and so suffer no Parallax: Therefore the further they are from the Zenith, and nearer the Horizon, so much the greater is their Parallax; which on the contrary is proportionably decreased, as they more and more approach the Vertix.</P>
<P><HI>Comets</HI> and new Appearances in the Aery Re∣gion suffer the greatest Parallax, next the <HI>Moon,</HI> and other Planets, to whom the Earth carries some sensible proportionate bulk: But higher, as in the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, to which the whole Earth is but as a Point, there is no Parallax; nor is it sensible in <HI>Saturn,</HI> or <HI>Jupiter;</HI> but <HI>Mars</HI> in Pe∣rigaeon, has a Parallax of 4 Minutes; in Apo∣gaeon, scarce any at all; <HI>Sol</HI> generally 3 Minutes, <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> very little; but the <HI>Moon,</HI> when near the Horizon, almost a whole Degree, and always appears lower than indeed she is.

<ITEM><P>[from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a Greek word, that sig∣nifies to turn about] are properly the two Extre∣mities of an Axis about which anything movable is turn'd: And because in the Heavens there is such a regular and never ceasing Circular Motion, and many Moveables, of which, each goes by its proper Orbit, therefore the Poles are very much to be minded in our Considerations of the Heavens, and as many Orbits as there are, so many double Poles are to be conceived. Thus the Poles of the <HI>Horizon</HI> are the <HI>Zenith</HI> and <HI>Nadir;</HI> the Poles of the <HI>Meridian,</HI> the two Points of the Rising and Setting of the Equator in the Horizon; the Poles of the <HI>Equinoctial Colure,</HI> are the two Solstitial Points <HI>Cancer</HI> and <HI>Capricorn;</HI> the Poles of the <HI>Solstitial Colure,</HI> the two Equinoctial Points <HI>Aries</HI> and <HI>Libra;</HI> the Poles of the <HI>Equator,</HI> and Circles thereunto Parallel, are the two Poles of the World; and lastly, of the <HI>Zodiac</HI> and <HI>Ecliptic,</HI> the Poles of the Zodiac, which describe two lesser Circles, <HI>Artick</HI> and <HI>Antartick,</HI> distant 23 Degrees and a half from the Poles of the World. Yet the word <HI>Poles</HI> absolutely taken, and without addition, is usually meant the Poles of the World, because onely they continue immovable, and all the Spheres hurried by the motion of the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> are once in 24 hours wheel'd round about them.

<P>But since these Poles are onely Points conceived in the Heavens, therefore that the Artick Pole of

<PB N="129" REF="72"/>
Diaphonous body, when thereby the Rays or Species of the Visible object are broken, and repre∣sent the things otherwise than in truth they are; as is manifest in Looking-glasses, which according to their greater Density or rarity notably alter the Object; the general Cause of Refractions are the obliquity of the Sight, and the thickness of the Air, which the thicker it is the greater will be the Re∣fraction, hence Stars near the Horizon are most obnoxious to it, whereas in the Meridian the Air is more clear and free from vapours, so that there they suffer little or no Refraction; the knowledge here∣of is of good use in Eclipses to find out the <HI>true</HI> time of Incidence, Greatness and Duration from the <HI>Ap∣parent.</HI></P></ITEM>

<LABEL>Retrograde,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>[Lat. moving or going back∣wards] A Planet is said to be so by Astronomers, when by his proper Motion in the Zodiac he moves contrary to the succession of the Signs; as if he go from the second degree of <HI>Aries</HI> to the first, and so into the 30th degree of <HI>Pisces,</HI> which is by all ac∣counted the greatest Debility that can happen to a Planet, as to be swift in Motion is a very great Fortitude; the reason whereof seems to be this, that when a Planet is swift, he strives more against the Motion of the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> and staying longer above the Earth has more time to diffuse his Light and Influence on Inferiors, whereas he that is Retrograde is so far from resisting, that he An∣ticipates the Motion of the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> and finishes his Revolution in less than 24 hours, so has not time to affect inferiors so powerfully with his Qualities, and consequently must be accounted <HI>weak;</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="73"/>
and this (by the way) may be one reason why the Planets have more power over us than the Fixed Stars.</P>
<P>To Retrogradation all Planets, except the <HI>Lu∣minaries,</HI> are subject; not that really they move backward, but because they are carried every one in his Epicycle, which has the <HI>Sun</HI> for his Centre and so whilst the Orbs are carried about with the rapid motion under the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> their Bodies, in respect of us, seem sometimes to move backwards, sometimes to stand still, and sometimes move swifter and slower, though in truth they always go on equally and in the same manner in their Epi∣cycle. But when they are in their first station, de∣scending from their <HI>Apogaeon</HI> to their <HI>Perigaeon,</HI> they appear Retrograde, as you may sensibly be∣hold in a Sphere.</P></ITEM>
<LABEL>Revolution,</LABEL>
<ITEM><P>[Lat. a turning round, or rol∣ling about] Is the Circulation of any Sphere or Star, till it return to the same point in which it was when first it began to move. Thus <HI>Saturn</HI> finishes his Revolution in the Zodiac in the space of almost thirty years, <HI>Jupiter</HI> in twelve, <HI>Mars</HI> in two, the <HI>Sun</HI> in one year, the <HI>Moon</HI> in one month, and the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> in the space of one natural day, that is, 24 hours. But sometimes, especially among Astrologers, the word is more strictly ta∣ken for the return of the <HI>Sun</HI> precisely to the same point of the Zodiac that he was in at the beginning of a thing. Thus the Figure of his en∣tring <HI>Aries</HI> is called the <HI>Revolution of the World.</HI> So in the Doctrine of <HI>Nativities,</HI> a <HI>Revolution</HI> is the annual return of the <HI>Sun</HI> to that very point wherein he was at the Radix, or time of Birth.

The second Mutual, when the Planet that is in most Degrees is Direct, and he in the least Degrees Retrograde, for then there is a Separation made on both sides. The con∣sideration of this is of great use in Astrology; for admit two Planets, being Significators in a Question of Marriage, are lately separated but a few minutes, we may judge there has been but few days before great probability of effecting the Mar∣riage; but now it hangs in suspense, and there seems some dislike or rupture in it: and according to the number of Degrees that the swifter Planet wanteth ere he can be wholly separated from the more pon∣derous, so many days, weeks, months and years as the Signs are movable, common, or fix'd, may it be ere the two Lovers will wholly desist, or see the matter quite broke off.</P></ITEM>

<P>But in Astronomy 'tis taken more specially for the whole Frame or Machine of the World, being of a Spherical Figure: but most strictly, for the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> embracing all the other Orbs and Celestial Bodies, which, in the space of one Natu∣ral Day, is volv'd and carri'd round on the Poles of the World about the Earth, according to <HI>Pto∣lomy;</HI> and which by reason of its different habi∣tude, or respect of the parts of the Earth to its Poles, is said to be either Right or Oblique.</P>
<P>A Right or Direct Sphere hath both the Poles of the World in the Horizon, &amp; the Equinoctial transiting the Zenith; so that all the Circles parallel to the E∣quator make Right Angles with the Horizon, and by it are divided into two equal parts, the <HI>Sun, Moon,</HI> and <HI>Stars</HI> being always 12 hours above, and 12 hours below the Horizon; conse∣quently the Days and Nights always just 12 hours long: and is called <HI>Right,</HI> because all the Celestial Bodies, by the Diurnal motion of the <HI>Pri∣mum Mobile</HI> Ascend directly above, and Descend directly below the Horizon As at the Isle of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and other places under the Equator.

<P>A <HI>Parallel Sphere</HI> is so called, because there the Equator lies directly in the Horizon, and in parallel thereunto; the whole year there being but as one Natural day, <HI>viz.</HI> one half year Day, and the other Night. The adjoyning Figure represents a Parallel Sphere.</P>
<P>From this division of the Sphere arises the di∣versity of Ascensions, to wit, of the Degrees of the Equator, and parts answering thereunto, thence denominated <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Oblique.</HI> For in a Right Sphere, all the Ascensions are Right; but in an Oblique Sphere, Oblique.</P>
<P>All which is demonstrated sensibly in that Ma∣thematical Instrument called the Sphere, which hence takes its name, having the Poles, Lines, and Great Circles therein represented.</P>

The second is their Perigaeum, where they are below the <HI>Sun,</HI> and nearest to the Earth, yet joyned again to the <HI>Sun</HI> in the same Degree of the Ecliptic, and from thence the Superiors become Occidental, and the Inferi∣ors Oriental. The other two points are on each side, in which they are farthest removed from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and are called their <HI>Stations,</HI> because as they are Ascending therein to their Apogaeum, or De∣scending therein to their Perigaeum, they seem in a manner to stand still, and not change their place in the Zodiac: Of which, the first Station is that on the right hand of the <HI>Sun,</HI> where they begin to go backward in the Zodiac, passing by their Pe∣rigaeon to their second Station, when being on the left hand of the <HI>Sun,</HI> they begin to grow Di∣rect.</P>
<P>Hence a Planet is said to be <HI>Stationary,</HI> when he is about either of these his Stations, Ascending or Descending in his Epicycle to his Apogaeum or Perigaeum, for that he seems not at all, or insensi∣bly at least, to be moved in the Zodiac, but per∣sisteth long in the same Degree, as long as he Ascends or Descends in those parts of his Orb, which are directly under one Degree of the Zo∣diac.</P></ITEM>

<ITEM><P>A Greek word whereby is intended the general Constitution, Fabrick and Harmony of the Universe, or an orderly Representation there∣of, according to some noted Hypothesis, wherein the Celestial Bodies are so disposed amonst them∣selves, and in respect of the Earth; as their Scitua∣tion, Order, Motions and Passions, may in such an Authors opinion best answer Appearances and Phi∣losophical Demonstrations; To this purpose the Ancients agreed, that the Globe of the Earth and Sea should be the Centre of the World, about which was diffused the Air, and round that the more light Element of Fire; Then the Orb of the <HI>Moon,</HI> and so <HI>Mercury, Venus, Sol, Mars, Ju∣piter,</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> in order, all respecting the Earth as their Centre; After which they placed the Firmament or Orb of the fixed Stars, and last of all the <HI>Primum Mobile.</HI></P>
<P>But of late, <HI>Copernicus,</HI> (a most ingenious Astro∣nomer) the better to Solve the appearances Invented, or rather revived, (for it was many ages before Started by some old Philosophers, but now buried
<PB N="154" REF="85"/>
and forgot) he, I say, revived another Hypothesis, which Constitutes the <HI>Sun</HI> Immoveable in the Centre of the World, next the Orb of <HI>Mercury,</HI> then <HI>Venus,</HI> in the third place the Globe of Earth, with the <HI>Moon</HI> continually moving about it, to which Globe of Earth, he assigns a threefold Mo∣tion, <HI>Diurnal,</HI> in 24 hours from West to East, which was before attributed to the <HI>Primum Mobile, An∣nual,</HI> which the <HI>Sun</HI> antiently challeng'd, and a third of <HI>Libration,</HI> whereby he solvd the Inequa∣lity of the Equinoxes, and obliquation of the Ecliptick from the Equater, for the <HI>5th.</HI> Planet he places <HI>Mars,</HI> then <HI>Jupiter,</HI> then <HI>Saturn,</HI> and last of all the Sphear of fixed Stars,</P>
<P>Since this, the Noble <HI>Tytho Brahe</HI> proposed his Hypothesis, making the Earth the Centre of both the Luminaries, and the Orb of fixed Stars, but the <HI>Sun</HI> the Centre of the othet four Planets; whom he counts all Eccentrick to the Earth, and constantly moving in the fluid Ether about the <HI>Sun, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All these Systemes have found their Disciples, and Propugnators: if any have a mind to be better Instructed in all or any of them, there are Sphears extant fitted for every of them, and shewing all the Motions and Affections of the Celestial Bodies truly, according to the intention of each Hypothesis.</P></ITEM>
