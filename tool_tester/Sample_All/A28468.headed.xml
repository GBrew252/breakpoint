<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ome will perhaps wonder, why I took so much pains to write this <HI>Book;</HI> and object, that we have two good <HI>Ones</HI> of this kind extant; <HI>Cowels Interpreter,</HI> and <HI>Terms of the Law,</HI> nay haply thrust in <HI>Leighs Phylolo∣gical Commentary,</HI> as a third: I answer, though it is not my design to raise the reputation of <HI>this Work,</HI> by disvaluing <HI>Those,</HI> yet it may be allowable modestly to declare <HI>their</HI> Defects, that my undertaking <HI>this</HI> may not appear unnecessary.</P>
<P><HI>Doctor Cowel</HI> was certainly a Learned Man, and his Enterprise very commendable, but his Profession the Civil Law; and, that he did not singly intend his <HI>Interpreter</HI> for us, appears by his often ex∣pressing what each word signifies in the <HI>Common Law,</HI> to distinguish it from the <HI>Civil;</HI> in which learning he bestowes a considerable part of his Book. He ingenuously says, <HI>His design is the advancement of knowledge, and to incite others to finish his model, and supply his de∣fects,</HI> which in truth are not a few; For, he directly mistakes the meaning of some Words, and derivation of others, as <HI>Ordel, Mindbruch, Brodehalpeny, Furlong, Avishering, Third∣with-hawanman,</HI> &amp;c. He confounds <HI>Realty</HI> with <HI>Royalty,</HI> and <HI>Commote</HI> with <HI>Comorth,</HI> which are distinct words. In the word <HI>Honor,</HI> he sayes, that in reading he has observ'd <HI>thus many</HI> Ho∣nors <HI>in England,</HI> and sets down 25; wherein, either his Reading was short, or his observations defective; for, I have collected above twice that number out of approved Authors and Records, in being when he wrote. He is sometimes too prolix in the derivation of a Word, setting down several Authors Opinions, without categori∣cally determining which is the true; as in <HI>Exchequer, Wither∣nam, Herald, Earle, Justices of Trailbaston, Pawnage, Purlieu,</HI> &amp;c. And lastly, gives us divers bare Words without ex∣plication, as <HI>Cone</HI> &amp; <HI>Key, Calendring, Coggs, Duch, Lance∣gay, Palingman, Bread of treet,</HI> &amp;c. which I have sup∣ply'd; Not but that I have lest some <HI>quaere's</HI> too but those in Words of greater difficulty.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Law-Terms</HI> was without doubt not less learned; but, wrote so long since, that his very Language and man∣ner
<PB REF="4"/>
of expression was almost antiquated, till help'd by the late cor∣rection of it; He has added to divers <HI>Words</HI> several Cases in Law, relating thereto in general, not tending much to their explication; which I have declin'd, lest the bulk should swell too big, and the principal Design be wav'd: He omits the <HI>Etymons</HI> for the most part, and is much more copious in the first part of the <HI>Alphabet,</HI> then in the later, which argues, the Author had not time, or perseve∣rance to finish it. They are both much wanting in the number of Words, especially the later; For <HI>Cowel</HI> glean'd many after the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> of the <HI>Law-Terms</HI> had inn'd his Harvest: yet, both have much useless and repealed Law in them; as in reference to <HI>Tenures</HI> by <HI>Knights-service</HI> and their Appendi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, <HI>Wardship, Villenage, Purvey∣ance, Star-chamber, Knighthood,</HI> &amp;c. For, thus sayes the learned Author of the <HI>Preface</HI> to <HI>Roll's Abridgment—As time, and ex∣perience, and use, and some Acts of Parliament have abridg'd some, and antiquided other Titles, so they have substituted and enlarged others. Cowel</HI> also, especially in the <HI>Folio Edition,</HI> (besides the misalphabeting) is extreamly misprinted; yet the <HI>Terms of the Law</HI> will still deservedly retain an usefulness <HI>pro tanto,</HI> and parti∣cularly for the <HI>Law-French,</HI> to instruct the young Student therein.</P>
<P><HI>Leigh</HI> affords not the least Objection against my Undertaking; for, he is a <HI>Commentator,</HI> not an <HI>Expositor;</HI> his Title speaks it, though sometimes he acts a little in both capacities.</P>
<P>Having found, these, among other, as I judg'd, important defects in those <HI>Authors,</HI> consider'd the usefulness of Books of this Na∣ture, and reflected on these Expressions of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coke on Litt. fo. 325, <HI>a &amp; 106. b.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Oracle</HI> of our Law—<HI>Here, as in ma∣ny other places it appears, how necessary it is to know the signification of Words.</HI> And again, <HI>That the explanation of ancient Words, and the true sence of them is requisite to be understood, per verba notiora:</HI> I was encourag'd to bestow my endeavour herein. And, it will abate the wonder, that I, who <HI>inter doctos me non effero,</HI> should yet not onely assume the liberty in many pla∣ces to correct those learned <HI>Authors,</HI> but also make an additional collection of above a thousand <HI>Words;</HI> if it be consider'd, That they wanted those Helps I have had, <HI>viz.</HI> That incomparable <HI>Glossarium Arohaiologicum</HI> of Sir <HI>Henry Spelman;</HI> The elaborate <HI>Institutes</HI> of Sir <HI>Edward Coke;</HI> That excellent <HI>Dictionarium Saxo∣nico-Latino-Anglicum</HI> of Mr. <HI>Somner;</HI> The Learned Works of Mr. <HI>William Dugdale,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fabian Philips,</HI> and others, publish'd since
<PB REF="4"/>
those <HI>Authors</HI> wrote. My <HI>Genius</HI> has also led me (though some∣times diverted) to this kind of search these thirty years, as my <HI>Glossographia</HI> will in some measure witness; For, whil'st my Con∣temporaries studied the Law it self, and gain'd Riches; I was hun∣ting after the difficult and uncuth <HI>Terms</HI> of it, and got nothing, but my own satisfaction.</P>
<P>Nor can I otherwise judge, but a <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o lexicon</HI> may be as neces∣sary and useful in our Law-Common-wealth, (even from the <HI>Coif</HI> to the puny-Clerk) as a <HI>Lexicon Juridicum</HI> among the <HI>Civilians,</HI> or <HI>Lexicon-Medicum</HI> with the <HI>Physitians</HI> since I am by this time perswaded, that no Law or Science has more abstruse <HI>Terms</HI> then ours.</P>
<P>Now, that I may in some measure prevent the Readers suspiti∣on, that my abilities are not commensurate with so great an Under∣taking; I'le tell him freely, I have, in this <HI>Meadow,</HI> made little <HI>hay</HI> with my own <HI>fork;</HI> but, in the more common <HI>words</HI> have made use of <HI>Cowel, Lambert, Crompton, West, Terms of the Law, Skene,</HI> &amp;c. yet seldom without Corrections, Contractions or Additions; In the Supplementals, <HI>Bracton, Britton, Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta, Spolman, Camden, Cake,</HI> our several <HI>Reporters,</HI> and divers other Authors have been my Guides: And, in such <HI>Words,</HI> wherein Printed Books afforded me no light, I have consulted <HI>Records, Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, ancient Manu∣scripts,</HI> and some of the best <HI>Antiquaries</HI> of these times, from whom I received both encouragement and assistance.</P>
<P>To many <HI>Words</HI> I have added their <HI>Etymo∣logies,</HI> where I found them apposite, encoura∣ged <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dodridges English Lawyer, fo. 75.</NOTE> thereto by the opinion of a Learned Judge—<HI>Etymologies, if they be rightly us'd, and drawn from the final cause, or from the Effect, do not onely yield an Argument of good consequence, but also afford much illustration and delight.</HI></P>
<P>I have briefly inserted all the old Writs out of the <HI>Registers,</HI> though many of them are worn out of use; and have not omitted even the <HI>Mechanick Words,</HI> mentioned in our <HI>Statutes;</HI> since there may be use of such knowledge in <HI>Pleadings:</HI> And <HI>Lawyers</HI> (as <HI>Cowel</HI> well observes) professing true Philosophy, should not be ig∣norant of such, nor even of Trees, from the <HI>Cedar of Lebanon</HI> to the <HI>Hysop</HI> that springs out of the Wall.</P>
<P>Though, to gratify the young Student, I have inserted some <HI>Words,</HI> which will seem very common to the more Learned, yet I have rejected divers I found in <HI>Cowel,</HI> as too mean, and indeed not
<PB REF="5"/>
at all deserving an explication; such are <HI>Groome, Sluce, Copie, Re∣vels, Toile, VVedding, Baubels,</HI> &amp;c. And the names of our common Drugs and Spices, mentioned in the Statute of 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> Besides the general design of this <HI>Dictionary</HI> in explaining the difficult <HI>Law∣terms</HI> both ancient and modern, I conceive the <HI>Student</HI> may make a further use of it, as a <HI>Repertory,</HI> or <HI>Common-place;</HI> Since many <HI>Statutes, Law-books, Charters</HI> and <HI>Records</HI> are cited, or referr'd to in most <HI>words:</HI> For, I have heard, the learned <HI>Lord Keeper Littleton</HI> made use of <HI>Cowels Interpreter</HI> for the like service.</P>
<P>If I have sometimes committed a <HI>Jeofaile,</HI> or hunted Counter in any explication or Etymology, in so large a field of words, and stor'd with such variety of Game, it will be no wonder, and, I hope, will draw no censure upon me from the Ingenuous: <HI>Quis enim mortalium in argumento tam vario &amp; im∣menso;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spel. in Praef. Glossar.</NOTE> <HI>tam nodoso, rigido &amp; caliginoso, alias non erret, alias non cae∣cutiat?</HI> Besides, the learned <HI>Spelman</HI> sometimes concludes a Word with a <HI>fateor me ignorare,</HI> and even Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> has err'd (pardon the boldness of that word) at least in <HI>Etymons,</HI> as in <HI>Atin, Hotchpot, Panel, Heriot, Domicellus,</HI> &amp;c. Therefore, if I leave some words with a <HI>Quaere,</HI> or a <HI>Fortasse,</HI> to be resolved, or corrected by the more learned; it is but what <HI>Cowel</HI> frequently, and <HI>Spelman</HI> has sometimes done.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O the end the</HI> Reader <HI>may readily know the Series of our Kings from the Conquest, and, for the most part, in what Kings Reign a Charter without Date is made, by His Title; and again, in what Year of our Lord every King Reigned, and how long, I have prefix'd a Necessary Table to that purpose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such also of the</HI> Saxon <HI>Characters, as are different from the Common; since, through the want of some knowledge in that Lan∣guage, Authors have committed many Errors; The word <HI>Ger∣suma</HI> being by some miswritten</HI> Gressume, <HI>by others</HI> Grossome, <HI>and by some</HI> Gressame. <HI>Grithbreche <HI>occurs in some,</HI></HI> Geth∣breche, Grithbrich, Greatbreach, Grichbreach, <HI>and</HI> Greach∣breach: <HI>So for</HI> ƿere <HI>&amp;</HI> ƿite (Were <HI>&amp;</HI> Wite) <HI>we meet with</HI> Pere <HI>&amp;</HI> Pite, <HI>and the like of divers other words.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Before the Conquest Charters were usually dated; sometimes by</HI> Olympiads, <HI>sometimes by</HI> Calends, Nones <HI>&amp;</HI> Ides, <HI>but most frequently by the year of our Lord. After the Conquest, Dates were commonly omitted, especially in the Deeds of Subjects, till King</HI> Edward the Second, <HI>and</HI> Edward the Thirds <HI>dayes, and thenceforth the year of the Kings Reign, or that of our Lord was constantly inserted: So that Deeds, made since the Conquest, and found without date, may be presumed to be in time before those Kings Reigns.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Witnesses names were added in the body of the Deed, and with the same Hand the Deed was written, till and in King</HI> Henry the Eighths <HI>time; but now changed into</HI> Endorsements, <HI>where the Witnesses subscribe their own Names.</HI></P>
<P>Additions <HI>to persons Names in publick Writings and Pleadings were very rarely used till the Statute of</HI> 1 Hen. 5.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
<HI>In my Progress, where any ancient Charters or Records were judg∣ed to be extraordinary, either for matter or form, I have transcri∣bed them at large, but the generality are abridg'd, to avoid pro∣lixity. One onely</HI> Seal <HI>of King</HI> Edward the Fourth, <HI>as he was</HI> Earl of March, <HI>I was induced, as well for the rarity, as preservation of it, to exhibit in Sculpture, though without the limits of my Province.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I need not Apologize the Latin, where it occurs, since both in ancient, as well as the modern times, our Law-pleadings, Char∣ters and Records were alwayes expressed</HI> forensi latinitate, <HI>which is acknowlodged not to be of the purer sort; And ae Dipthongs of old seldome used, though I have mostly supply'd them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To some</HI> Words <HI>I have added the</HI> variae lectiones <HI>I met with, as <HI>Churchesset, Flemenefyrinthe, Lairwite, Sca∣vage,</HI></HI> &amp;c. <HI>To others the Etymons, which sometimes proved the more difficult, in that divers of our Law-Terms, of birth since the Conquest, are</HI> voces hybridae, <HI>mungrel words; one part Saxon, the other French or Latin, not without a mixture sometimes of British and other Languages.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Records and Charters I cite were for the most part copied from the</HI> Originals; <HI>some from printed Books of unquestionable Au∣thority; others, from the Collections and Manuscripts of faithful and industrious lovers of Antiquity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Law-Dictionary: Interpreting such difficult Words and obscure Terms, as are found, either in our Common or Statute, Ancient or Modern LAWS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="A" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Bactors <HI>(abactores)</HI></HI> were steal∣ers of Cattle or Beasts, by Herds or great numbers; and were distinguished from <HI>Fures. Nam qui ovem unam surripu∣erit, ut</HI> fur <HI>coercetur, qui gre∣gem, ut</HI> abactor. <HI>M. S.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abate</HI> (from the French <HI>abatre</HI> or <HI>abbatre, i.</HI> To fell, break down or defeat utterly) signifies properly, to diminish or take away; and in our Law-writers, it has a like signification: For to <HI>abate</HI> a Castle or Fortlet <HI>(Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 45.) in <HI>Westm. 1. cap.</HI> 17. is interpreted to beat it down. And to <HI>abate</HI> a Writ, is to de∣feat or overthrow it by some error or excepti∣on. <HI>Britton. cap.</HI> 48. As he that puts out the Possessor is said to <HI>Disseise;</HI> so he that steps in between the former Possessor and his Heir, is said to <HI>abate.</HI> And in the Stat. <HI>De conjunctim Feoffatis, 34. Edw.</HI> 1. The Writ shall be <HI>abated,</HI> that is, shall be disabled or overthrown. So in <HI>Stamfords Pleas of the Crown, fol.</HI> 148. The Ap∣peal <HI>abates</HI> by Covin, <HI>i.</HI> The Accusation is de∣feated by Deceit, <HI>Anno 11 Hen. 6. cap. 2.—The Justices shall cause to be</HI> abated <HI>and quashed the said Writ.</HI> See <HI>Intrusion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abatement</HI> (Fr.) is sometimes used for the Act of the <HI>Abator;</HI> as the <HI>Abatement</HI> of the Heir into the Land, before he has agreed with the Lord <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 91. Sometimes for the affection or passing the thing <HI>abated;</HI> as <HI>Abatement</HI> of the Writ. <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 214. And in this signification it is as much as <HI>Exceptio di∣latoria,</HI> with the Civilians <HI>(Brit. cap.</HI> 51.) or rather an effect of it: For the Exception al∣leaged and made good, works the <HI>Abatement.</HI> And this Exception may be taken, either to the insufficiency of the Matter, or incertainty of the Allegation, by misnaming the Plantiff, De∣fendant, or place; to the variance between the Writ, and the Specialty or Record; to the in∣certainty of the Writ, Count, or Declaration, or to the death of either of the parties, before Judgment had, and for divers other causes: Upon which defaults, the Defendant may pray, That the Writ or Plaint may <HI>abate;</HI> that is, the Plaintiffs sute against him, may cease for that time. To prevent the <HI>Abatement</HI> of Writs of Error, see the Statute 6 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 2. Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> says, <HI>Abatamentum</HI> is a word of Art, and signifies an Entry by interposi∣tion. On <HI>Littl. fol.</HI> 277. where he shews the dif∣ference between <HI>Abatement, Disseisin, Intru∣sion, Deforcement, Usurpation,</HI> and <HI>Purpre∣sture.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abbacy <HI>(abbatia)</HI></HI> is the same to an Abbot, as Bishoprick to a Bishop: We may call it his <HI>Paternity. Talis</HI> Abbatia <HI>(quae Paternitas Lati∣no nomine dicitur) funditus removeatur.</HI> Concil. Meldens. <HI>Anno Dom. 845. cap.</HI> 10. The word is used <HI>Anno 34 &amp; 35 Hen. 8. cap. 17, 18. Sciant—quod ego Isabella<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Comitissa Penbr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pio salute animae meae—Dedi Deo &amp;</HI> Abbathiae <HI>de Nutteleg. totam Wicham juxta praedictam</HI> Abba∣thiam, &amp;c. sine dat.</P>
<P><HI>Abbat or Abbot <HI>(Abbas)</HI></HI> A Spiritual Lord, that has the rule and preheminence over a Religious House. He is by <HI>Justinian</HI> termed <HI>Archimandrita,</HI> by others <HI>Coenobiarcha vel Archimonachus.</HI> Of these, some in <HI>England</HI> were <HI>mitred,</HI> some not: The <HI>mitred</HI> were ex∣empt
<PB REF="8"/>
from the jurisdiction of the Diocesan, having Episcopal Authority within their Pre∣cincts, and being also Lords of the Parliament; which were called <HI>Abbots Soveraign (Anno 9 Rich. 2. cap.</HI> 4.) and <HI>Abbots General;</HI> The other sort were subject to the Diocesan in all Spiritual Government. And as <HI>Abbots,</HI> so were there Lord Priors also, who, both had exempt Jurisdiction, and were Lords of Par∣liament, as appears by Sir <HI>Edw. Coke, de Jure Eccles. fol.</HI> 28. Of which <HI>Lord Abbots</HI> and Priors that sate in Parliament, some Authors reckon but Twenty six: Sir <HI>Edw. Coke</HI> says they were Twenty seven <HI>Abbots</HI> and two Priors. (On <HI>Littl. fol.</HI> 97.) In the Parliament 20 <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. there were but Twenty five <HI>Abbots</HI> and two Priors. But in the Summons to the Parliament at <HI>Win∣ton, Anno 4 Edw. 3.

<P><HI>Abbuttals</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>abutter</HI> or <HI>abouter,</HI> i. <HI>terminare)</HI> are the Buttings or Boundings of any Land, East, West, North, or South; de∣claring on what other Lands, High-ways, or other places it does <HI>Abbut:</HI> As in <HI>Crokes Re∣ports, 2 part. fol. 184.

<PB REF="8"/>
Fee-simple lies in</HI> Abeyance; that is, as himself interprets it, onely in the remembrance, in∣tendment and consideration of the Law. The Frank-tenement of the Gleab of a Parsonage, is in no man during the time the Parsonage is void, but is in <HI>Abeyance.</HI> And it is a Principle in the Law, <HI>That of every Land there is Fee∣simple in some man, or it is in</HI> Abeyance. Con∣sidering this with the signification of the <HI>French</HI> word, it is probable our Ancient Law Books would signifie hereby a kinde of hope or long∣ing expectance; because those things that are in <HI>Abeyance,</HI> though for the present in no man, yet are they in hope and expectation, belonging to him who is next to enjoy them. For I finde also in the <HI>French,</HI> that <HI>Bayard</HI> is a Man that gapes or gazes earnestly at a thing. And, this <HI>Abeyance</HI> may be compared to that which the <HI>Civilians</HI> call <HI>Haereditatem jacentem.</HI> See <HI>Coke on Littl. fol. 342. b.</HI> And <HI>Plowden casu Walsin∣gham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Abet</HI> (from the <HI>a. i.</HI> ad <HI>vel</HI> usque, and <HI>betan. <HI>i. e. emendare, excitare)</HI></HI> signifies to encourage, incite or set on. The Substantive <HI>Abetment</HI> is used for an encouraging or instigation. <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. fol.</HI> 105. And <HI>Abetter</HI> or <HI>Abbettator</HI> for an instigator or setter on. <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 21. But, both Verb and Noun are always used in the evil part: As <HI>Abettors of Murder</HI> are those that command, counsel, or maintain others to murder: And in some Cases such <HI>Abettors</HI> shall be taken as Principals, in other, but as Accessories, and their presence or ab∣sence at the Deed doing, makes a difference in the Case.</P>
<P><HI>Abishersing,</HI> (according to <HI>Rastals</HI> Exposi∣tion) is to be quit of Amerciaments before whomsoever, for Transumption proved. The word originally signifies a Forfeiture, or an Amerciament, and is much transformed in the writing, since more probably it should be <HI>Mishersing, Mishering,</HI> or <HI>Miskering,</HI> accord∣ing to the Learned <HI>Spelman.</HI> It seems by some Authors, to signifie a Freedom or Liberty; be∣cause he that has this word in any Charter or Grant, has not onely the Forfeitures and A∣merciaments of all others for transgressions within his Fee; but also is himself free from all such control, by any within that compass.</P>
<P><HI>Abjuration <HI>(abjuratio)</HI></HI> a forswearing or renouncing by Oath; a sworn banishment, or an Oath taken to forsake the Realm for ever. For, as <HI>Stamford (Pl. Cor. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 40.) saith, The devotion towards the Church (first in <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the Confessors time, and afterward till 22 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8.) was so zealous, That, if a man, having committed Felony, could recover a Church or Churchyard, before he were appre∣hended; he might not be thence drawn to the usual tryal of Law; but confessing his fault to the Justices, at their coming, or to the Coro∣ner, and before them or him, give his oath finally to forsake the Realm: The form and effect whereof you may read in <HI>De Officis Co∣ronatorum,</HI> and in <HI>Horns Mirror of Justices, lib. 1. cap. Del Office de Coroner. Quando ali∣quis abjuravit regnum Cruoc ei liberata fuit in ma∣nu sua portanda in itinere suo per semitas regias &amp; vocabitur vexillum sanctae Ecclesiae, Essex. Plac. Hil. 26 Ed.</HI> 3. But this grew at last to be but a perpetual confining the offender to some Sanctuary, wherein, upon <HI>abjuration</HI> of his li∣berty and free habitations, he would chuse to spend hs life, as appears <HI>Anno 22 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 14. It is Enacted 21 <HI>Jac. cap.</HI> 28. That here∣after no Sanctuary or Priviledge of Sanctuary, shall be allowed; and consequently <HI>Abjuration</HI> is taken away, 2 <HI>Instit. fol.</HI> 629.

<P><HI>Abolition <HI>(Anno 25 Hen. 8. cap.</HI></HI> 21.) A destroying or putting out of memory. <HI>Institutae actionis peremptio.</HI> The leave given by the King or Judges to a criminal accuser to desist from further prosecution.</P>
<P><HI>Abridge</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Abreger)</HI> to make shorter in words, holding still the whole sub∣stance: But in Law it seems to signifie, for the most part, the making a <HI>Declaration</HI> or <HI>Count</HI> shorter, by substracting or severing some of its substance. For example, a Man is said to <HI>abridge</HI> his Plaint in an Assize, or a Woman her Demand in an Action of <HI>Dower,</HI> that hath put into the Plaint or Demand any Land, not in the Tenure of the Tenant or Defendant; and, if the Tenant pleads <HI>Non-tenure,</HI> or such-like Plea to parcel of the Land demanded, in A∣batement of the Writ; the Demandant may <HI>abridge</HI> his Plaint or Demand to that patcel, that is, he may leave out that part, and pray the Tenant may answer the rest, to which he has not yet pleaded any thing: The cause is, for that in such Writs the certainty is not set down, but they run in general. And though the Demandant hath <HI>abridged</HI> his Plaint or De∣mand in part, yet the Writ remains good still for the rest. <HI>Brook, tit. Abridgment. An. 21 H. 8. cap.</HI> 3.</P>

<P><HI>Accedas ad Curiam</HI> (Lat.) is a Writ that lies for him, who has received false Judgment, or fears partiality in a Court Baron, or Hun∣dred Court, being directed to the Sheriff, as appears by <HI>Dyer, fol. 169. numb.</HI> 20. As the Writ <HI>De falso judicio</HI> lies for him that has re∣ceived such Judgment in the County Court, the form whereof you may see in <HI>Fitz. Nat. Er fol.</HI> 18. And in the <HI>Register, fol. 9. b.</HI> where it is said this Writ lies for Justice delayed, as well as falsly given; and that it is a <HI>Species</HI> of the Writ <HI>Recordare.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Accedas ad Uicecomitem,</HI> is a Writ di∣rected to the Coroner, commanding him to deliver a Writ to the Sheriff, who having a

<HI>Pone</HI> delivered him, doth suppress it, <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol.</HI> 83.</P>
<P><HI>Acceptance <HI>(acceptatio)</HI></HI> is a taking in good part, and a tacite kinde of agreeing to some former Act done by another, which might have been undone or avoided, if such <HI>Acceptance</HI> had not been. For example, if <HI>Baron</HI> and <HI>Feme</HI> seized of Land in right of the Feme, make a joynt Lease or Feoffment by Deed; reserving Rent, the Baron dies, the Feme ac∣cepts or receives the Rent: By this the Feoff∣ment or Lease is made good, and shall bar her to bring the Writ <HI>Cui in vita. Coke on Littl. fol. 211. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Accessory</HI> or <HI>Accessary <HI>(particeps criminis)</HI></HI> most commonly signifies, one that is guilty of a felonious offence, not principally, but by participation, as by command, advice or con∣cealment, and is of two sorts, 1. <HI>Before the offence or fact,</HI> is he that commands or procures another to commit Felony, and is not himself present; but, if he be, then he is also a Princi∣pal. 2. <HI>After the offence,</HI> is he that receives, assists, or comforts any man, that has done any Murder or Felony, whereof he hath knowledge. He who counsels or commands any evil, shall be judged <HI>accessary</HI> to all that follows upon it, but not to another distinct thing. As, I com∣mand one to beat another, and he beats him so, that the other dies of it, I shall be <HI>accessary</HI> to this murder. But, if I command one to steal a White Horse, and he steals a Black one; or to burn such a House, which he well knows, and he burns another, I shall not be <HI>accessary.</HI> If I command one to kill <HI>I. S.</HI> in the Field, and he kills him in the City or Church, or to kill him at such a day, and he kill him on another, I shall be <HI>accessary</HI> nothwithstanding: For the killing is the substance, and the day, place, or weapon, is but circumstance. But if I command one to kill <HI>I. S.</HI> and before he hath killed him, I come and say, I am penitent for my malice, and charge him not to kill him, and yet he kills him, I shall not be <HI>accessary.</HI> Where the <HI>Principal</HI> is pardoned or hath his Clergy, the <HI>Accessary</HI> cannot be arraigned; there being a Maxim in the Law, <HI>Ubi non est principalis non potest esse accessorius:</HI> For, it appears not by the Judgment of Law, that he was <HI>Principal;</HI> but if the <HI>Principal,</HI> after Attainder, be par∣doned or hath his Clergy allowed him, there the <HI>Accessary</HI> shall be arraigned. See Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Cokes, 2 Part Institutes, fol.</HI> 183. In the lowest and highest offences, there are no <HI>Accessaries,</HI> but all are <HI>Principals;</HI> as in Riots, forcible Entries, and other transgressions, <HI>Vi &amp; armis,</HI> which are the lowest offences. So in the highest offence, which is <HI>crimen laesae Ma∣jestatis,</HI> there are no <HI>Accessaries;</HI> but in Felony there are, both before, and after. <HI>Coke on Lit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. fol.</HI> 71. There cannot be an <HI>Accessary</HI> before the Fact, in Man-slaughter; because that is sudden and unprepensed. See more in <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. lib. 1. cap. 45, 46, 47, 48.

<P><HI>Accompt <HI>(computus)</HI></HI> is taken for a Writ or Action, which lies against a Bailiff or Receiver, who ought to render an <HI>account</HI> to his Lord or Master, and refuseth. And by the Statute of <HI>Westm. 2. cap.</HI> 1. if the Accomptant be found in arrear, the Auditors that are assigned to him, have power to award him to prison, there to remain, till he makes agreement with the party. But if the Auditors will not allow reasonable expence and costs, or if they charge him with more Receipts then they ought, his next friend may sue a Writ of <HI>Ex parte talis</HI> out of the Chancery, directed to the Sheriff, to take four <HI>Mainpernors,</HI> to bring his body before the Ba∣rons of the Exchequer, and to warn the Lord to appear there at a certain day. See <HI>Fitzh. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 116.</P>
<P><HI>Accord</HI> (Fr.) Agreement, Concordance, Consent. Particularly it is an Agreement be∣tween two or more, where any person is in∣jured by a Trespass, Offence, or Contract, to satisfie and content him with some recompence, which, if executed, and performed, shall be a good Bar in Law, if the other party (after the <HI>Accord</HI> performed) bring any Action for the same.</P>
<P><HI>Accroche</HI> (Fr. <HI>accrocher)</HI> To hook, clasp, or grapple unto. It is used <HI>(Anno 25 Edw. 3. Stat. 3. cap.</HI> 8.) as <HI>Encroach.</HI> In <HI>France,</HI> even at this day <HI>Accrocher un Proces,</HI> signifies to stay a Suit, or to delay the proceeding of it for a time. See <HI>Encroachment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Achat</HI> (Fr. <HI>Achet, i.</HI> A Bargain or Pur∣chase) is used for a Contract or Bargain. <HI>Brook, tit. Contract. Purveyors</HI> were by Parlia∣ment, 36 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. ordained to be then after called <HI>Achators.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Acquietandis plegiis,</HI> Is a Writ lying for a Surety against the Creditor that refuseth to acquit him, after the Debt is paid. <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol.</HI> 158. Where it appears, that this is a <HI>Justicies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Acquital</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>acquiter,</HI> to free, ac∣quit, or discharge) most commonly signifies a Deliverance, discharge, and setting free from the suspition or guilt of an offence; and is twofold, <HI>Acquittal in Law,</HI> and <HI>Acquittal in Fact.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Acquital in Law,</HI> Is when, two are appeal∣ed or endited of Felony, one as Principal, the other as Accessary; the Principal being dis∣charged, the Accessary is by consequence also freed. And in this case, as the Accessary is ac∣quitted by Law, so is the Principal in Fact. <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. fol. 168. Acquital</HI> is also where there is a Lord, Mesn, and Tenant; and the Tenant holds Lands of the Mesn, and the Mesn holds over of the Lord Paramount: Now the Mesn ought to <HI>acquit</HI> the Tenant of all services claimed by any other for the same Lands; for the Tenant must do his service to the Mesn onely, and not to divers Lords for one parcel
<PB REF="9"/>
of Land. See <HI>Coke on Littleton, fol.</HI> 100.</P>
<P><HI>Acquittance <HI>(acquietantia)</HI></HI> Is a Release or Discharge of a Debt formerly due But the Verb <HI>(acquit)</HI> the Participle <HI>acquitted,</HI> and the Noun <HI>acquittal,</HI> signifie also a discharge or clearing from an offence objected; as <HI>acquitted</HI> by Proclamation. <HI>Smith de Rep.

<P><HI>Acre</HI> (from the Germ. <HI>Acker, <HI>i. ager)</HI></HI> Is a parcel of Land, containing in length forty Perches, and four in bredth, or to that quan∣tity, be the length more or less. And, if a Man erect any new Cottage, he must lay four <HI>Acres</HI> of Land to it, after this measure. <HI>Anno 31 E∣liz. cap.</HI> 7. With this measure agrees <HI>Crompt in his Jur. of Courts, fol.</HI> 222. Though he says, ac∣cording to the Custom of divers Countreys, the Pearch differs, being in some places, and most ordinarily but sixteen foot and a half; but in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> twenty four foot, as was adjudged in the Case between Sir <HI>Edward Aston,</HI> and Sir <HI>John B.</HI> in the <HI>Exchequer.</HI> In the Statute concerning sowing Flax, (24 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 4.) eightscore Perches make an <HI>Acre,</HI> which is forty multiplied by four: See also the Ordi∣nance of Measuring Land, 31 <HI>Edw. 1. Stat.</HI> 1. which agrees with this account.</P>
<P><HI>Action <HI>(actio)</HI></HI> is thus defined by <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. cap. 1. &amp; 3. Actio nihil aliud est quam jus prosequendi in judicio quod alicui debetur;</HI> and is divided into <HI>personal, real,</HI> and <HI>mixt.</HI> See <HI>Cokes 2 Inst. fol.</HI> 40.</P>
<P><HI>Action personal,</HI> is that which one Man hath against another, by reason of any Contract for Money or Goods, or for offence done by him, or some other person, for whose Fact he is by Law answerable.</P>
<P><HI>Action real,</HI> is that whereby the Demandant claims title to any Lands or Tenements, Rents, or Commons, in Fee-simple, Fee-tail, or for life. And every <HI>Action real,</HI> is either <HI>Posses∣sory,</HI> that is, of his own Possession or Seisin; or <HI>ancestrel,</HI> of the Seisin or Possession of his Ancestor. <HI>Coke, lib. 6. fol.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Real Actions,</HI> as <HI>Writs of Right, Writs of En∣try, &amp;c.</HI> And their several Appendixes, as <HI>Grand Cape, Petit Cape, Receit, View, Aid-Prayer, Voucher, Counter-plea of Voucher, Coun∣ter-plea of Warrantry, Recovery in value,</HI> were several great Titles in our <HI>Year-Books,</HI> but now much out of use. <HI>Preface to Rolls Abridg∣ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Action mixt,</HI> is that which lies indifferent∣ly against the thing detained, or against the person of the Detainer; and is so called, be∣cause it hath a <HI>mixt</HI> respect, both to the thing and the person: Or (as others define it) is Sute given by the Law to recover the thing de∣manded, and damages for wrong done: As in Assize of <HI>Novel Disseisin,</HI> which Writ (if the Disseissor make a Feoffment to another) the Disseisee shall have against the Disseisor; and the Feoffee, or other Ter-Tenant to recover not onely the Land, but damages also. And so is an Action of <HI>Wast</HI> and <HI>Quare impedit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Actions</HI> are also divided into <HI>Civil, Penal,</HI> and <HI>Mixt. Coke, Vol. 6. fol. 61. a. Action Civil</HI> is that which tends onely to the recovery of that which by reason of any Contract, or other like cause, is due to us: As if a Man by Action seek to recover a sum of Money formerly lent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Action Penal</HI> aims at some penalty, or punishment in the party sued, be it corporal or pecuniary: As in the Action <HI>Legis Aquiliae</HI> in the Civil Law; and with us, the next friends of a Man feloniously slain or wounded, shall pursue the Law against the offender, and bring him to condign punishment. <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. cap.</HI> 4.</P>
<P><HI>Action Mixt,</HI> is that which seeks both the thing, whereof we are deprived, and a penalty for the unjust detaining it: As in an Action for Tythe upon the Statute 2 &amp; 3 <HI>Edw. 6. cap. 13. Item est alia</HI> Actio Mixta, <HI>quae dicitur</HI> Actio Hirciscundae, &amp; <HI>locum habet inter eos qni com∣munem habent haereditatem, &amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Coke on Littl. fol. 262. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Action</HI> is also (according to the Form of the Writ) divided into such as are conceived to recover, either the simple value of the thing chalenged, or the double, trebble, or quadruple. As a <HI>Decies tantum</HI> lies against <HI>Embracers. Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 171. And against Jurors that take Money for their Verdict of either or both par∣ties: And to be short, any other Action upon a Statute, that punishes any offence by Resti∣tution or Fine, proportionable to the Trans∣gression.</P>
<P><HI>Action</HI> is <HI>Pre-judicial</HI> (otherwise termed <HI>Pre∣paratory)</HI> or else <HI>Principal. Pre-judicial</HI> is that which grows from some question, or doubt in the <HI>Principal:</HI> As if a Man sue his younger Brother for Land descended from his Father, and it is objected, he is a Bastard. <HI>Bracton, lib 3. cap. 4. Numb.</HI> 6. This point of Bastardy must be tryed, before the cause can further pro∣ceed; and therefore is termed <HI>Pre-judicialis, quia prius judicanda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Action</HI> is either <HI>Ancestrel</HI> or <HI>Personal, Stamf. Pl. Cor. 59. Ancestrel</HI> seems to be that, which we have by some right descending from our <HI>Ancestor;</HI> and <HI>Personal,</HI> which has begin∣ning in, and from our selves. There is also <HI>Action Ancestrel Droiturel,</HI> and <HI>Action An∣cestrel Possessary;</HI> which see in <HI>Cokes 2 Inst. fol.</HI> 291.</P>
<P><HI>Action upon the Case (actio super casum)</HI> is a general Action given for redress of wrongs done to any Man without force, and by Law not especially provided for, and is now most in use. For, where you have any occasion of Suite, that neither has a fit name, nor certain Form already prescribed; there the Clerks of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> in ancient time, conceived a sit Form of Action for the thing in question, which the <HI>Civilians</HI> call <HI>Actionem in Factum,</HI> and we, <HI>Action upon the Case.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Action upon the Statute (actio super Statutum)</HI> is an Action brought against a Man, upon an offence against a Statute, whereby an Action is
<PB REF="10"/>
given, and lay not before. As, where one com∣mits Perjury, to the prejudice of another, he, who is endamaged, shall have a Writ upon the Statute, and his Cause. And, the difference between an <HI>Action upon the Statute,</HI> and <HI>Acti∣on Popular,</HI> is, Where the Statute gives the Suite or Action to the party grieved, or other∣wise to one person certain, that is called <HI>Acti∣on upon the Statute.</HI> But where Authority is gi∣ven by the Statute to every one that will so sue, that is termed <HI>Action Popular.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Action</HI> is Perpetual or Temporal <HI>(Perpetua vel Temporalis)</HI> and that is called <HI>Perpetual,</HI> whose force is by no time determined. Of which sort were all Civil Actions among the Ancient <HI>Romans, viz.</HI> Such as grew from Laws, Decrees of the Senate, or Constitutions of the Emperors; whereas Actions granted by the <HI>Pretor,</HI> died within the year. So we have in <HI>England, Perpetual</HI> and <HI>Temporary Actions,</HI> and I think all may be called <HI>Perpetual,</HI> that are not expresly limited. As divers Statutes give Actions, so they be pursued within the time by them prescribed; namely, the Statute of 1 <HI>Edw. 6. cap.</HI> 1. gives Action for three years after the offences committed, and no longer. And the Statute of 7 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 3. doth the like for four years, and that of 31 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 5. for one year, and no more. But, as by the Civil Law, no Actions were at the last so per∣petual, but that by time they might be pre∣scribed against: So in our Law, though Acti∣ons may be called <HI>Perpetual,</HI> in comparison of those that are expresly limited by Statute, yet is there a means to prescribe against Real Acti∣ons after five years, by a Fine levied, or a Recovery suffered; as you may see in the words, <HI>Fine, Recovery,</HI> and <HI>Limitation of As∣size.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Action of a Writ,</HI> is a term used, when one pleads some matter, by which he shews the Plaintiff had no cause to have the Writ he brought; yet it may be, he might have another Writ or Action for the same matter. Such a Plea is called, <HI>A Plea to the Action of the Writ.</HI> Whereas, if by the Plea it should appear, That the Plaintiff has no cause to have an Acti∣on for the thing demanded; then it is called <HI>A Plea to the Action.</HI> Cowel.</P>
<P><HI>Acts of Parliament</HI> are Positive Laws, which consist of two parts <HI>(viz.)</HI> Of the words of the <HI>Act,</HI> and the sence of it, and they both, joyned together, make the Law.</P>
<P><HI>Acton-Burnel,</HI> a Statute so called, made 13 <HI>Edw, 1. &amp; An.</HI> 1285. Ordaining the <HI>Sta∣tute Merchant</HI> for Recovery of Debts; and was so termed, because made at <HI>Acton-Burnel,</HI> a Castle, anciently of the <HI>Burnels,</HI> afterward of the <HI>Lovels</HI> in <HI>Shropshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Actuary <HI>(actuarius)</HI></HI> is the Scribe that Re∣gisters the Acts and Constitutions of the Con∣vocation.</P>
<P><HI>Addition <HI>(additio)</HI></HI> signifies, A Title given to a Man over and above his Christian and Sirname, shewing his Estate, Degree, Mystery, Trade, Place of dwelling, <HI>&amp;c. Additions of Estate,</HI> are these, <HI>Yeoman, Gentleman, Esquire,</HI> and such like. <HI>Additions of Degree</HI> are those we call names of Dignity, as <HI>Knight, Lord, Earl, Marquess,</HI> and <HI>Duke. Additions of Mystery,</HI> are, <HI>Scrivener, Painter, Mason, &amp;c. Addition of Town,</HI> as <HI>Dale, Thorp,</HI> and such like. And, where a Man hath houshold in two places, he shall be said to dwell in both of them;. so that his <HI>Addition</HI> in either may suffice.</P>
<P>By the Statute of 1 <HI>Hen 5. cap.</HI> 5. It was or∣dained, That in Suits or Actions where Proces of Outlary lies, such <HI>Additions</HI> should be to the name of the Defendant, to shew his Estate, Mystery, and place where he dwells, and that the Writs, not having such <HI>Additions,</HI> shall abate, if the Defendant take exception there∣to; but not, by the Office of the Court. And this was ordained, to the intent, that one Man might not be vexed, or troubled by the Outlary of another; but by reason of the certain <HI>Ad∣dition,</HI> every person may bear his own burden. See 2 <HI>Part. Institut. fol.</HI> 595. &amp; 666. And the Statute 27 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 7.</P>

<P><HI>Adjournment</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>adjournement)</HI> Is when any Court is dissolved for the present, or put off, and assigned to be kept again at an∣other day or place. <HI>Adjournment in Eyre (Anno 25 Edw.</HI> 3. Statute of <HI>Purveyers, cap.</HI> 18.) Is an appointment of a day, when the Justices in <HI>Eyre</HI> mean to sit again. And in 2 <HI>Edw. 3. cap. 11. Adjournment</HI> has the like sig∣nification. See <HI>Prorogue.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ad inquirendum,</HI> is a Writ <HI>Judicial,</HI> com∣manding enquiry to be made of any thing touch∣ing a Cause depending in the Kings Court, for the better execution of Justice, as of <HI>Bastardy,</HI> and such like. Whereof see great di∣versity in the Table of the <HI>Register Judicial, Verbo, Ad inquirendum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ad jura Regis,</HI> Is a Writ that lies for the Kings Clerk, against him that sought to eject him to the prejudice of the <HI>Kings Title</HI> in right of his Crown. Of which see <HI>Register of Writs, fol. 61. a.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Admeasurement <HI>(admensuratio)</HI></HI> Is a Writ which lies, for bringing those to Reason, or a Mediocrity, that usurp more then their share. And this in two Cases, the one termed <HI>Ad∣measurement of Dower (Admensuratio Dotis)</HI> where the Widow of the deceased, holds from
<PB REF="10"/>
the Heir, or his Guardian, more, in the name of her Dower, then of right belongs to her. <HI>Register of Writs, fol. 171. a. Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 148. In which case, the Heir shall be restored to the overplus. The other, <HI>Admeasurement of Pasture, (Admensuratio pasturae)</HI> which lies between those, who have Common of Pasture, appendant to their Freehold, or Common by Vicenage, in case any of them Surcharge the Common with more Cattle than they ought. <HI>Regist. fol. 156. b.

<P><HI>Adminicle <HI>(adminiculum)</HI></HI> Aid, help, sup∣port. <HI>Anno 1 Edw. 4. cap.</HI> 1.</P>
<P><HI>Administrator</HI> (Lat.) Is he that hath the Goods of a Man dying intestate, committed to his charge by the Ordinary, and is account∣able for the same, whensoever it shall please the Ordinary to call him thereto.

<P><HI>Admiral <HI>(Admiralius, Admirallus, Ad∣miralis, Capitaneus,</HI></HI> or <HI>Custos Maris)</HI> signifies, An High Officer, or Magistrate, that hath the Government of the Kings Navy.

This Officer is in all Kingdoms of <HI>Europe</HI> that border on the Sea. He hath cog∣nizance of the death, or maim of a man, com∣mitted in any great Ship, riding in great Ri∣vers, beneath the Bridges thereof, next the Sea; also to arrest Ships in the great Streams, for the service of the King or Commonwealth, and hath jurisdiction in such Streams, during the same voyages. And it appears, that an∣ciently the <HI>Admirals</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> had juris∣diction of all causes of Merchants and Mari∣ners, hapning not onely upon the main Sea, but in all foraign parts within the Kings Do∣minions, and without them, and were to judge them in a Summary way, according to the Laws of <HI>Oleron,</HI> and other Sea-Laws.

<P><HI>Ad quod damnum,</HI> Is a Writ that lies to the Sheriff to enquire what hurt it may be for the King, to grant a Fair or Market in any Town, or place; or for the King, or any other person to grant any Lands in Fee-simple to any House of Religion, or other Body Poli∣tick. For in such case the Land so given, is said to fall into a <HI>dead hand;</HI> that is, such an estate and condition, that the chief Lords lose all hope of Heriots, service of Court and Es∣cheats, upon any traiterous or fellonious of∣fence committed by the Tenant. For a Body Politick dies not, nor can perform personal service to the King, or their Mesn Lords, as single persons may do. And therefore it is reasonable, that before any such grant be made, it should be known what prejudice it is like to work to the Grantor. Of this read more in <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 221. And see <HI>Mortmain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ad terminum qui praeteriit,</HI> Is a Writ of <HI>Entry,</HI> that lies where a Man, having Leased Lands or Tenements for term of life or years; and after the term expired, is held from them by the Tenant or other Stranger that enjoys the same, and deforceth the Lessor. Which Writ lies for the Lessor, and his heir also. <HI>Fitz Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 201.</P>

<P><HI>Advowzen <HI>(advocatio)</HI></HI> A right to present to a Benefice; as much as <HI>Jus Patronatus</HI> in the Canon Law. The reason why it is so term∣ed, is, Because they that originally obtained the right of presenting to any Church, were up∣holders of, or great Benefactors to that Church, either by building or increasing it; and are therefore sometimes termed <HI>Patroni,</HI> sometimes <HI>Advocati,</HI> sometimes <HI>Defensores, Cap. 4. &amp; 23. De jure Patronatus in Decretal.</HI> And <HI>Advowzen</HI> (being a Bastard-French word) is used for the right of presenting; as appears by the Statute of <HI>Westminster, Anno 13 Edw. 1. cap.</HI> 5.</P>
<P><HI>Advowzen,</HI> Is of two sorts, <HI>Advowzen in Gross,</HI> that is, Sole, not adhering to any Man∣nor, as parcel of its right; and <HI>Advowzen Appendant,</HI> which depends upon a Mannor, as appurtenant to it, termed by <HI>Kitchin</HI> an <HI>In∣cident</HI> that may be separated from the <HI>Subject.</HI> Of this <HI>Skene, De verbor. sign.</HI> hath these words, <HI>Dicitur Advocatio Ecclesiae, vel quia Patronus alicujus Ecclesiae ratione sui juris advocat se ad eandem Ecclesiam, &amp; asserit se in eadem habere jus Patronatus, eamque esse sui quasi clientis loco, vel potius cum aliquis (nempe Patronus) advocat alium jure suo ad Ecclesiam vacantem, eumque loco alterius (veluti defuncti) praesentat, &amp; quasi exhibet.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Affeerers <HI>(afferatores)</HI></HI> probably from the Fr. <HI>affier, i.</HI> To confirm or affirm,) are those that are appointed in Court Leets upon Oath, to settle and moderate the Fines of such as have committed faults arbitrarily punishable, and have no express penalty set down by Statute. The Form of their Oath you may see in <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 46. The reason of this appellation seems to be, because those that are appointed to this Office, do <HI>affirm</HI> upon their Oaths, what penal∣ty they think in Conscience the Offender hath deserved. We finde this word used, <HI>Anno 25 Edw. 3. Stat.</HI> 7. (viz.) <HI>The same Justices

before their rising in every Sessions, shall cause the Amerciaments so be affiered.</HI> And to the same effect, <HI>Anno 26 Hen. 6. cap. 6.

<P><HI>Affray</HI> (of the Fr. <HI>affros, i.</HI> A fright) Sig∣nifies a skirmish or fighting between two or more. <HI>Lamb.</HI> in his <HI>Eirenarcha, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 3. saith, It is ofttimes confounded with <HI>Assault;</HI> but they differ in this, That an <HI>Assault</HI> is onely a wrong to the party, an <HI>Affray</HI> is a common wrong: And therefore both are enquirable and punishable in a Leet. An <HI>Affray</HI> may al∣so be without word or blow given: As if a Man shew himself furnished with Armor or Weapons, not usually worn, it may strike a fear into others unarmed. And so it is used, <HI>An. 2 Edw. 3. cap.</HI> 3.</P>

<P><HI>Age <HI>(aetas,</HI></HI> Fr. <HI>aage,)</HI> Signifies that part of Mans life, which is from his birth, to this, or his last day. But in Law it is particulary used for those especial <HI>times,</HI> which enable Men or Women to do that, which before for want of Age, and consequently of Judgment, they might not do. These in a Man, are two; at Fourteen years he is at the Age of Discretion, Twenty one years, is his full Age. <HI>Littleton, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 4. In a Woman there were six Ages ob∣served: First, at Seven years of Age her Fa∣ther might, of old, Distrain the Tenants of his Mannor, for Aid to marry her: For at those years she may consent to Matrimony. <HI>Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 36. numb.</HI> 3. Secondly, At nine years old, she is Dowable; for then or within half a year after, she is able <HI>Promereri dotem &amp; virum sustinere. Fleta, lib. 1. cap. 22. Littl. lib. 1. cap.</HI> 5. Which <HI>Bracton</HI> does notwithstanding limit unto Twelve years. Thirdly, At Twelve years she is able finally, to ratifie and confirm her former consent to Matrimony. Fourthly, At Fourteen she is enabled to receive her Lands into her own hands, and should be out of Ward, if she were of this Age at her Ancestors death. Fifthly, At Sixteen years she should be out of Ward, though at the death of her Ancestor she was under Fourteen. The reason is, Because then she might take a Husband able to perform Knights service. Sixthly, At Twenty one years she is able to alienate her Lands and Tenements. Also at the Age of Fourteen, a Man is enabled to chuse his own Guardian, and to claim his Land holden in Soccage. <HI>Dyer, fol.</HI> 162. Which <HI>Bracton (Lib.</HI> 2.) limits at Fifteen years, with whom <HI>Glanvile</HI> also agrees. And at Fourteen a Man may consent to Marriage, as a Woman at Twelve. At the Age of Fifteen years, a Man ought to be sworn to keep the Peace. <HI>An. 34 Edw. 1. Stat.</HI> 3. The Age of Twenty one did compel a Man to be Knight, that had Twen∣ty pound Land <HI>per annum</HI> in Fee, or for term of life. <HI>Anno 1 Edw. 2. Stat.</HI> 1. Which Sta∣tute is repealed 17 <HI>Car. 1. cap.</HI> 20. That Age also enables him to make Contracts, and man∣age his estate; which until that time, he cannot do, with security of those that deal with him. The Age of Twelve years binds to appearance before the Sheriffs and Coroner, for enquiry after Robberies. <HI>Anno 52 Hen. 3. cap.</HI> 24. The Age of Fourteen years enables to enter an Or∣der of Religion, without consent of Parents. <HI>Anno 4 Hen. 4. cap.</HI> 17. See <HI>Coke on Littl. fol. 78. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Age Prier <HI>(aetatem precari,</HI></HI> or <HI>aetatis pre∣catio)</HI> Is a Petition or Motion made in Court by one in his minority, (having an Action brought against him for Lands coming to him by descent) that the Action may rest till he come to full age; which the Court, in most Cases, ought to grant. This is otherwise in the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> which enforceth Children in their minority to answer by their Tutors or Cura∣tors.</P>

<P><HI>Agist</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>giste, i.</HI> A Bed or Resting-place, or from <HI>gister, i. stabulari)</HI> Sig∣nifies to take in, and feed the Cattle of Stran∣gers in the Kings Forest, and to gather the Money due for the same. <HI>Charta de Foresta, cap.</HI> 9. The Officers that do this, are called <HI>Agistors,</HI> in English <HI>Guest</HI> or <HI>Gist-takers. Crom. Jurisd. fol.</HI> 146. These are made by the Kings Letters Patent, and he hath four of them in
<PB REF="12"/>
every Forest, where he has any Pawnage. In what their Office consists, see <HI>Manwood, Part 1. Of Forest Laws, p.</HI> 336. Their Function is term∣ed <HI>Agistment;</HI> as, <HI>Agistment upon the Sea Banks. Anno 6 Hen. 6. cap.</HI> 5. This word <HI>agist</HI> is also used for the taking in of other Mens Cattle into any Mans Ground, at a certain rate <HI>per</HI> week. See 4 <HI>Part. Instit. fol.</HI> 293.</P>
<P><HI>Agreement <HI>(Agreamentum, Plowden, fol.</HI></HI> 17.) Is a joyning or putting together of two or more Mindes in any thing done, or to be done; and this is in three manners, 1. An <HI>Agree∣ment</HI> executed at the beginning. 2. An <HI>Agree∣ment</HI> after an Act done by another, and is exe∣cuted also. 3. An <HI>Agreement</HI> executory, or to be done. The first is such, whereof men∣tion is made in the Statute of 25 <HI>Edw. 3. cap.</HI> 3. of Cloaths, which saith, <HI>That the Goods bought by Forestallers, being thereof attainted, shall be forfeit to the King, if the Buyer thereof have made <HI>Gree</HI> with the Seller;</HI> where the word <HI>Gree,</HI> which is otherwise called <HI>Agreement Executed,</HI> signifies Payment for the things, or Satisfacti∣on. The second is, where one does an Act, and another agrees or assents thereunto afterwards. The third is, when both parties at one time are <HI>agreed,</HI> that such a thing shall be done in time to come; which is <HI>Executory,</HI> in regard the thing is to be done afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Aid <HI>(auxilium)</HI></HI> Is all one in signification with the French <HI>aide,</HI> and differs onely in pro∣nunciation, if we take it as it is used in our vulgar language. But, in our Laws, it hath divers particular significations, as sometimes it signifies a Subsidy. <HI>An. 14 Edw. 3. Stat. 2. cap.</HI> 1. Sometimes a Prestation due from Te∣nants to their Lords, as toward the Relief due to the Lord Paramount. <HI>Glanvile, lib. 9. cap.</HI> 3. This the King or other Lord might of old lay on their Tenants, for Knighting his eldest son at the age of fifteen years, or marrying his daughter at seven. <HI>Register of Writs, fol. 87. a.</HI> And that at what rate themselves listed. But the Statute of <HI>Westm. 1. An. 3 Edw.</HI> 1. ordain∣ed a Restraint herein upon common persons, being Lords, and tied them to a constant rate. And 25 <HI>Edw 3. Stat. 5. cap.</HI> 11. Provides, that the rate set down by the former Statute should hold in the King, as well as in other Lords. Of which, I finde mention in the Sta∣tute of 27 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 10. This Imposition seems to have descended to us from <HI>Normandy,</HI> (or rather from a more ancient Original, <HI>viz.</HI> The Feodal Laws.) For in the <HI>Grand Custu∣mary, cap.</HI> 35. you have a <HI>Tractat,</HI> entituled, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> aides Chevelz. i. De auxiliis capitalibus;</HI> whereof the first is, <HI>A faire Paine filz de son seigneur Chevalier, i.</HI> To make the eldest son Knight. The second, <HI>Son ainee fille marier, i.</HI> To marry the eldest daughter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Both these, and all charges incident thereunto, are taken away and discharged by Statute, 12 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>This word <HI>Aid</HI> is also particularly used in Matter of Pleading, for a Petition made in Court for the calling in of help from another, that hath an interest in the Cause in question; and is likely to give strength, both to the party that <HI>prays in Aid</HI> of him, and also to avoid a prejudice growing toward his own right, if not prevented. But this course of proceeding is of late much disused. <HI>Fitz-Herbert</HI> men∣tions both <HI>Prier in Ayde,</HI> and <HI>Prier</HI> Ayde <HI>de Patron, &amp;c. Auxilium petere à patrono, Nat.

<P>This <HI>Ayd-prier</HI> or <HI>Aid-prayer,</HI> is sometime also used in the Kings behalf, that there be no proceeding against him, till his Council be cal∣led, and heard what they can say, for avoid∣ing the Kings prejudice or loss in the cause in hand. Also a City or Borough that hath a Fee-Farm of the King, may <HI>pray in Ayd</HI> of him, if any thing be demanded of them relating thereto. Of this you may read the Statute <HI>De Bigamis, An. 4 Edw. 1. cap. 1. 2 &amp; 3. 14 Edw. 3. Stat. 1. cap. 14. &amp; 19 Car. 2. cap. 8. Vide Resceit.</HI></P>

<PB REF="13"/>
by the before recited Statutes, still holding the name <HI>Alnager,</HI> because the collection of that Subsidy was by <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, committed to the charge of the <HI>Alnager,</HI> and he never∣theless not abridged of his measuring and searching, till by his own wilful neglect they became separated, and that by distinct Laws. Insomuch, as there is now a peculiar <HI>Measurer,</HI> who ought to allow the Assize of length and bredth to every particular Cloth, made in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales:</HI> And, because the Subjects of this Land should not be abused, an office of <HI>Searching</HI> is established by Act of Parlia∣ment, whose Officer ought by his Seals, judi∣ciously and diligently affixed, to denote the defaults and casual abuses which each particular Cloth contains. All these Offices were ancient∣ly under the cognizance of the <HI>Alnager;</HI> as you may read at large in a Treatise, entituled, <HI>The Golden Fleece,</HI> Printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1656.

<P><HI>Amerciament</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Merci, i. mi∣sericordia,)</HI> signifies the pecuntary punishment of an offender against the King, or other Lord in his Court, that is found to be in <HI>misericordia, i.</HI> to have offended, and to stand to the <HI>mercy</HI> of the Lord. There seems to be a difference between <HI>Amerciaments</HI> and <HI>Fines:</HI> These, as they are taken for punishments, are punishments certain, which grow expresly from some Sta∣tute; but <HI>Amerciaments</HI> are arbitrably im∣posed by <HI>Affeerors.</HI> See <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 78. and 214. <HI>Manwood</HI> (in his first part of <HI>Forest Laws, pag.</HI> 166.) makes another difference, as if an <HI>Amerciament</HI> were a more easie or merciful penalty, and a <HI>Fine</HI> more sharp and grievous. Take his words, <HI>If the Pledges for such a Tres∣pass appear by common Summons, and not the Defendant himself, then the Pledges shall be im∣prisoned for the Defendants default.

The benefit of this Tenure consists in these Points. 1. The Tenants holding by Charter, cannot be impleaded out of their Mannor, or, if they be, they may abate the Writ; by Pleading their Tenure, before or after answer made. 2. They are free of Toll, for all things, concerning their Sustenance and Husbandry. 3. They may not be empannelled upon any Enquest. See more in <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol. 14. d. &amp; fol. 228, &amp;c.</HI> By whom it appears, these Tenants held originally by Ploughing the Kings Land, plashing his Hedges, or such like, towards the mainte∣nance of his Houshold; in which regard, they had such Liberties given them, wherein, to avoid disturbance, they may have Writs to such as take the Duties of Toll; as likewise for Immunity of Portage, Passage, or such like.

Annuity</HI> is otherwise de∣fined to be a certain sum of Money granted to another in Fee-simple, Fee-tail, for Life or Years, to receive of the Grantor or his Heirs, so that no Free-hold be charged therewith; whereof a man shall never have Assize, or other Action, but a Writ of <HI>Annuity. Doctor and Student, Dial. 1. cap.</HI> 3. Shews several dif∣ferences between a Rent, and an <HI>Annuity,</HI> whereof the first is, That every Rent, be it Rent-charge, Rent-service, or Rent-seek, is issuing out of Land; but an <HI>Annuity</HI> chargeth the person onely, that is to say, The Grantor or his Heirs that have Assets by descent. The second is, That for the recovery of an <HI>An∣nuity,</HI> no Action lies, but onely the Writ of <HI>Annuity</HI> against the Grantor, his Heirs, or Successors; but of a Rent, the same Actions lie as do of Land, as the Case requires. The third difference is, That an <HI>Annuity</HI> is never taken for Assets, because it is no Free-hold in Law, nor shall it be put in Execution upon a Statute Merchant, Statute Staple or <HI>Elegit,</HI> as a Rent may. <HI>Dyer, fol. 345. numb. 2.

<P><HI>Appeal</HI> (Fr. <HI>Appel)</HI> Is as much as <HI>accu∣satio</HI> with the <HI>Civilians.</HI> For, as in the Civil Law, Cognizance of Criminal Causes, is taken either upon inquisition, denunciation, or ac∣cusation; so in ours, upon <HI>Indictment</HI> or <HI>Ap∣peal: Indictment</HI> comprehending both <HI>Inquisi∣tion</HI> and <HI>Denunciation;</HI> and <HI>Accusation</HI> or <HI>Appeal,</HI> is a lawful Declaration of another Mans crime (which by <HI>Bracton</HI> must be Felony at least) before a competent Judge, by one that sets his name to the Declaration, and un∣dertakes to prove it, upon the penalty that may ensue of the contrary. For the whole course of an <HI>Appeal,</HI> I must refer you to <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. tract. 2. cap. 18. Smith de Republ. Angl. lib. 3 cap. 3. Britton, cap.</HI> 22, 25. And to <HI>Stamf. Pl. Coron. lib. 2. cap. 6, 7, &amp;c.</HI> An <HI>Ap∣peal</HI> is commenced two ways, either by <HI>Writ</HI> or by <HI>Bill; Appeal by Writ</HI> is, when a Writ is purchased out of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> by one to an∣other; to this end, that he Appeal a third of some Felony committed by him, finding Pledges that he shall do it, and deliver this Writ to the Sheriff to be recorded. <HI>Appeal by Bill</HI> is, when a Man of himself gives up his Accusation in Writing to the Sheriff or Coroner, offering to undergo the burden of Appealing the per∣son therein named.</P>
<P>This point of our Law, among others is drawn from the <HI>Normans,</HI> which appears plain∣ly by the <HI>Grand Customary, cap.</HI> 68. Where there is set down a solemn discourse, both of the effects of this <HI>Appeal, viz.</HI> The Order of the Combat, and of the Tryal by Inquest; which by our Law, is in the choice of the De∣fendant. See <HI>New Book of Entries, verbo Ap∣pel. Book of Assizes, fol.</HI> 78. And 3 <HI>Part. Inst. fol.</HI> 131.</P>
<P><HI>Appeal of Maihem,</HI> Is an accusing of one that hath <HI>maimed</HI> another. But that being no Felony, the Appeal thereof is but in a manner an Action of <HI>Trespass;</HI> because there is nothing recorded but damages. <HI>Bracton</HI> calls this <HI>Ap∣pellum de Plagiis &amp; Mahemio,</HI> and writes a whole Chapter of it, <HI>Lib. 3. Tract. 2. cap.</HI> 24. See <HI>Coke, Vol. 4. fol. 43. a.</HI> In King <HI>Johns</HI> time, there is recorded an <HI>Appeal</HI> against a <HI>Jew, Qui fecit ementulari quendam nepotem suum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Appeal of wrong Imprisonment,</HI> Is used by <HI>Bracton</HI> for an Action of wrong Imprisonment, <HI>Lib. 3. Tract. 2. cap.</HI> 25.</P>
<P><HI>Appeal</HI> (from <HI>Appello,</HI> to call, because <HI>Appellans vocat reum in judicium, Coke on Littl. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 11.) Is divers times used in our
<PB REF="14"/>
Common Law, as in the Civil; which is for a removing of a Cause from an Inferior Judge to a Superior; <HI>As Appeal to Rome, Anno 24 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 12. and 1 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 1. So S. <HI>Paul</HI> appealed from <HI>Festus</HI> to <HI>Caesar.</HI> But more com∣monly for the private accusation of a Murderer, by a Person who had interest in the party mur∣dered, or of any Felon by one of his Com∣plices in the Fact. See <HI>Approver,</HI> and see <HI>Coke on Littl. fol. 287. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Appellor</HI> or <HI>Appealor,</HI> Is he, who hath committed some Felony which he confesses, and now <HI>Appeals,</HI> that is, Accuses others who were complices with him. And those that are so ap∣pealed are called <HI>Appealees. Anno 28 Edw.</HI> 1. See <HI>Approver.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Appendant <HI>(appendens)</HI></HI> Is an Inheritance belonging to another that is more worthy; as <HI>Accessorium principali</HI> with the <HI>Civilians,</HI> or, <HI>Adjunctum subjecto</HI> with the <HI>Logicians.</HI> An Hospital may be <HI>Appendant</HI> to a Mannor, <HI>Fitz.

<P><HI>Appennage</HI> or <HI>Apennage</HI> (Fr.) The por∣tion of the Kings younger Children in <HI>France,</HI> a Childes part. They have in <HI>France</HI> a Funda∣mental Law, which they call the <HI>Law of Apen∣nages,</HI> whereby the Kings younger Sons have Dutchies, Counties, or Baronies, granted un∣to them, and their Heirs, or Heirs-males of their Bodies, the Reversion reserved to the Crown, and all Matters of Regality, as Coyn∣age, Levying Taxes, and the like. It is derived <HI>Ab appendendo,</HI> or from the <HI>German</HI> word <HI>Avanage,</HI> which signifies a <HI>Portion.</HI> See <HI>Gerard du Heylan, &amp; Spel. Glossar. in voce</HI> Appen∣nagium.</P>
<P><HI>Appertinances <HI>(pertinentia)</HI></HI> Are things both <HI>Corporal,</HI> belonging to another thing, as to the more principal; as Hamlets to a cheif Mannor, Common of Pasture, Turbary, Pis∣cary, and such like; and <HI>Incorporeal,</HI> as Liber∣ties, and Services of Tenants, <HI>Brit. cap.</HI> 39. Where it may be observed, That he accounts Common of Pasture, Turbary, and Piscary, to be things <HI>Corporal.</HI> See <HI>Common.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Apportionment <HI>(apportionamentum)</HI></HI> Is a dividing of a Rent into parts, according as the Land (whence the whole Rent issues) is di∣vided among two or more. As if a Man have a Rent-service issuing out of Land, and he purchaseth part of the Land, the Rent shall be <HI>apportioned,</HI> according to the value of the Land. So if a Man let Lands for years, re∣serving Rent, and after a stranger recovers part of the Land, the Rent shall be <HI>apporti∣oned.</HI> But a Rent-charge cannot be <HI>apportioned,</HI> nor things that are entire; As if one hold Land by service, to pay to his Lord yearly at such a Feast, a Horse, or Rose; there, if the Lord purchase part of the Land, this service is to∣tally extinct; because such things cannot be divided without hurt to the whole. Yet in some Cases a Rent-charge shall be <HI>apportioned,</HI> as if a Man hath a Rent-charge issuing out of Land, and his Father purchaseth part of the Land charged in Fee, and dies, and this par∣cel descends to his Son, who hath the Rent∣charge; there this Charge shall be <HI>apportioned,</HI> according to the value of the Land; because such portion of the Land, purchased by the Father, comes not to the Son by his own Act, but by descent and course of Law. Common Appendant is of common right, and severable; and though the Commoner, in such case, pur∣chase parcel of the Land, wherein the Common is Appendant, yet the Common shall be <HI>appor∣tioned.</HI> But in this case, Common Appurtenant, and not Appendant, by such Purchase is ex∣tinct. <HI>Coke, lib. 8. fol.</HI> 79.</P>
<P><HI>Apposer.</HI> See <HI>Forein Apposer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Apprendre,</HI> (Fr.) As Fee or Profit <HI>Ap∣prendre (Anno 2 &amp; 3 Edw. 6. cap.</HI> 8.) Fee or Profit to be taken or received.</P>
<P><HI>Apprentice,</HI> (Fr. <HI>apprenti,</HI> and that from <HI>apprendre,</HI> to learn, whence their <HI>apprentisage,</HI> and our <HI>apprentiship)</HI> Is one that is bound by Covenant to serve a Tradesman or Artificer, a certain time (for the most part seven years) upon condition, That the Master shall, during that time, instruct him in his Art or Mystery. Sir <HI>Tho. Smith</HI> (in his <HI>Rep. Angl. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 8.) says, They are a kinde of Bondmen, differ∣ing onely, in that they are servants by Cove∣nant, and for a time. Anciently Barrasters were called <HI>Apprentices of the Law.</HI> As ap∣pears by Mr. <HI>Seldens</HI> Notes upon <HI>Fortescu, p.</HI> 3. So the Learned <HI>Plowden</HI> stiled himself. Sir <HI>Henry Finch</HI> in his <HI>Nomotechnia</HI> writes himself <HI>Apprentice del Ley;</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> in his 2 <HI>Part. Instit. fol.</HI> 564. says <HI>Apprenticii Legis,</HI> in pleading, are called <HI>Homines consili∣arii, &amp; in Lege periti.</HI> And in another place,—<HI>Apprentices, and other Counsellors of Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Appropriation <HI>(appropriatio,</HI></HI> from the Fr. <HI>approprier, i. aptare, accomodare)</HI> Signifies the severing of a Benefice Ecclesiastical (which originally, and in nature is, <HI>Juris Divini, &amp; in Patrimonio nullius)</HI> to the <HI>proper</HI> and perpe∣tual use of some Religious House, Bishoprick, College, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So called, because Parsons, not being ordinarily accounted <HI>(Domini)</HI> but <HI>usu∣fructarii,</HI> having no right of Fee-simple, are by reason of their perpetuity, accounted own∣ers of the Fee-simple, and therefore called <HI>Proprietarii.</HI> Before the time of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, it was lawful (as it seems) to <HI>appro∣priate</HI> the whole Fruits of a Benefice to an Abbey or Priory, they finding one to serve the Cure. But that King ordained, That in every Licence of <HI>Appropriation</HI> made in <HI>Chan∣cery,</HI> it should expresly be contained, That the Diocesan of the place should provide a con∣venient sum of money to be yearly paid out of the Fruits, towards the sustenance of the poor in that Parish, and that the Vicar should be well and sufficiently endowed, <HI>Anno 15 Rich. 2. cap.</HI> 6. To make an <HI>Appropriation</HI> (after Licence obtained of the King in <HI>Chancery)</HI> the consent of the Diocesan, Patron, and Incum∣bent
<PB REF="15"/>
are necessary, if the Church be full; if it be void, the Diocesan, and the Patron, up∣on the Kings Licence, may conclude it. <HI>Plow∣den</HI> in <HI>Grendons</HI> Case, <HI>fol.</HI> 496. To dissolve an <HI>Appropriation,</HI> it is enough to present a Clerk to the Bishop, and he to institute, and induct him: For that once done, the Benefice returns to the former nature, <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br.</HI> 35. and <HI>Coke, lib. 7. fol.</HI> 13.</P>
<P><HI>Approvement <HI>(Anno 43 Eliz. cap.</HI></HI> 11.) Is the same with <HI>improvement;</HI> but it is more particularly used for the enclosing part of a Common by the Lord of the Mannor, leaving sufficient nevertheless for the Commoners.</P>
<P><HI>Approver <HI>(approbator)</HI></HI> Is one, that confes∣sing Felony committed by himself, appeals or accuses others to be guilty of the same; and is so called, because he must <HI>prove</HI> that which he hath alleaged in his Appeal. This Proof is by Battle, or by the Countrey, at his election that appealed. The Form of this Accusation you may in part gather by <HI>Cromptons Justice of Peace, fol. 250. &amp;</HI> 251. That it is done before the Coroner, either assigned to the Felon by the Court, to take and record what he saith, or else cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the Felon himself, and requi∣red for the good of the Commonwealth to do so. The <HI>Approvers</HI> Oath, when he begins the Combat, you may see in the last Page of <HI>Crompton,</HI> as also the Proclamation by the Herauld. Of the Antiquity of this Law, read at large <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. Tract. 2. cap. 21. &amp; 34. Stamf. Pl. Cor. lib. 2. cap. 52. cum seq.</HI> And 3 <HI>Part. Instit. fol.</HI> 129.

<P><HI>Arbitrator</HI> (Lat.) Is an exttaordinary Judge or Commissioner in one or more Causes, between party and party, chosen by their mu∣tual consents.

The <HI>Civilians</HI> make a difference between <HI>Arbiter</HI> and <HI>Arbitrator:</HI> For though they both ground their power upon the comprimise of the parties, yet their liberty is divers. For <HI>Arbiter</HI> is tied to proceed and judge according to Law, with Equity intermingled; <HI>Arbitrator</HI> is per∣mitted wholly to his own discretion, without solemnity of Process or Course of Judgment, to hear or determine the Controversie commit∣ted to him; so it be <HI>Juxta Arbitrium boni viri.</HI> See <HI>Alto &amp; Basso.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Arches Court <HI>(Curia de Arcubus)</HI></HI> Is the chief and ancientest Consistory that belongs to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for debating Spiritual Causes; and is so called from <HI>Bow-Church</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> (dedicated to the <HI>Blessed Virgin)</HI> where it was kept. And the Church is so called of the fashion of the Steeple or <HI>Clochier</HI> thereof, whose top is raised of Stone-pillars, built <HI>Arch-wise,</HI> like so many <HI>Bent-Bows.</HI></P>
<P>The Judge of this Court is termed <HI>The Dean of the Arches,</HI> or <HI>The Official of the Arches Court. Dean of the Arches,</HI> because with this Officialty is commonly joyned a pe∣culiar Jurisdiction of Thirteen Parishes in <HI>London,</HI> termed a <HI>Deanry,</HI> being exempted from the Authority of the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and belonging to the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> of which, the Parish of <HI>Bow</HI> is one, and the chief, because the Court was there kept.</P>
<P>The Jurisdiction of this Judge is ordinary, and extends it self through the whole Province of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> So that upon any Appeal made, he forthwith, and without any further exami∣nation of the Cause, sends out his Citation to the Appealee, and his Inhibition to the Judge, from whom the Appeal was made.

<P><HI>Assart,</HI> (Fr. <HI>Essarter,</HI> to glade or make Glades in a Wood, to make Plain, to Grub up or clear a ground of Bushes, Shrubs, &amp;c.) Is (according to <HI>Manwood, cap. 9. numb.</HI> 1.) an offence committed in the Forest, by pluck∣ing up those Woods by the Roots, which are Thickets, and Cover for the Deer, and by making them plain as arable Land; which is the greatest Offence or Trespass that can be done in the Forest, to Vert or Venison, con∣taining as much or more then <HI>Waste.</HI> For whereas <HI>Waste</HI> of the Forest, is but the Felling and Cutting down the Coverts, which may grow again: <HI>Assart</HI> is a Plucking them up, and Destroying them; which is confirmed out of the Red Book in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> in these words, <HI>Assarta verò occasiones nominantur, quando Forestae nemora vel Dumeta, pascuis &amp; latibulis ferarum oportuna, succiduntur: Quibus succisis &amp; radicitus avulsis, terra subvertitur &amp; excoli∣tur.</HI> And again out of <HI>Register of Writs, fol.</HI> 257. in the Writ <HI>Ad quod Damnum,</HI> sent out in case where a Man sues for a Licence to <HI>Assart</HI> his Grounds in the Forest, and to make it several for Tillage.

To this <HI>Bracton</HI> may be added, <HI>(Lib. 4. cap.</HI> 38.) who saith, That these words <HI>Boscus efficitnr Assartum,</HI> signifie as much as <HI>Redactus ad culturam.</HI> Of this you may read more in <HI>Cromp.

<P><HI>Assets</HI> (Fr. <HI>Assez, i. satis)</HI> Signifies Goods <HI>enow</HI> to discharge that burden, which is cast upon the Executor, or Heir, in satisfying the Testators or Ancestors debts, or Legacies. In <HI>Brook, titulo, Assets par descent,</HI> you shall finde, That whoever charges another with <HI>Assets,</HI> charges him with having <HI>enough</HI> descended, or come to his hands to discharge that which is in demand. Of this there are two sorts, <HI>Assets per descent,</HI> and <HI>Assets enter mains.</HI></P>
<P>The first is, Where a Man enters into Bond, and dies seised of Lands in Fee-simple, which descend to his Heirs, and are therefore charge∣able as <HI>Assets</HI> in his hands: But if the Heir <HI>alien</HI> the Lands, before the Bond be put in suit, he is discharged. <HI>Assets enter mains,</HI> is when a Man dies indebted, leaving to his Ex¦ecutors sufficient to discharge his Debts and Legacies; this is called <HI>Assets in their hands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Assign <HI>(assignare)</HI></HI> Hath two significations; one <HI>general,</HI> as to appoint a Deputy, or to set over a right to another; in which, <HI>Britton (fol.</HI> 122.) saith, this word was first brought into use in favor of Bastards, because they cannot pass under the name of Heirs, were therefore comprised under that of <HI>Assignes.</HI> The other <HI>special,</HI> as to point at, or set forth, <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>Assign Error,</HI> is to shew in what part of the Process Error is committed. <HI>To assign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>false Judgment,</HI> is to declare how and where the Judgment is unjust. To <HI>assign</HI> a false Verdict. <HI>Old Nat. Br: fol. 17, 19, &amp;</HI> 112. To <HI>assign</HI> Waste, is to shew, wherein especially the Waste is committed. <HI>Register of Writs, fol. 72. Assign</HI> in the general signification is used, <HI>Anno 20 Edw.</HI> 1. and 11 <HI>Hen. 6. cap.</HI> 2. in these words, <HI>Justices</HI> assigned <HI>to take Assizes.</HI> And the Substantive <HI>Assignment</HI> hath the same signification; as the <HI>Assignment</HI> of a Lease, is the setting over, or transferring the Lessees interest to another.</P>
<P><HI>Assignee,</HI> Is he that is deputed or appoint∣ed by another to do any act, or perform any business, or enjoy any commodity; and he may be so, either by <HI>Deed,</HI> or in <HI>Law. As∣signee by Deed,</HI> is when a Lessee of a term, sells and assigns the same to another, that other is his <HI>Assignee by Deed. Assignee by Law,</HI> is he whom the Law so makes, without any ap∣pointment of the person; as an Executor is the <HI>Assignee</HI> in Law to the Testator, who dies possessed of a Lease made to him and his <HI>As∣signes. Perkins (tit. Grants)</HI> says, An <HI>Assignee</HI> is he that possesses, or enjoys a thing in his own right; and <HI>Depty,</HI> is he that does it in the right of another.</P>
<P><HI>Assise of mort d'auncester <HI>(Assisa mortis antecessoris)</HI></HI> Lies where my Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, Uncle, Aunt, &amp;c. died seised of Lands, Tenements, Rents, &amp;c. that he had in Fee-simple, and after his death a stranger abates: And it is good as well against the Aba∣tor, as any other in possession. How likewise this is extended, see <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. tract. 3. per totum. Britton, cap. 70. F. Nat. Br. fol. 114. Register of Writs, fol.</HI> 223.</P>

And of this s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. tract. 5. cap 1. &amp; seq. Britton, cap.</HI> 95. The reason why these Writs are cal∣led <HI>Assises,</HI> may be divers. First, because they settle the Possession, and so an outward right in him that obtains by them. Secondly, They were originally executed at a certain time and place formerly appointed. For by the <HI>Norman</HI> Law, the time and place must be known forty days before the Justices sit on them: And by our Law there must be likewise fifteen days of preparation, except they be tried in the standing Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> as appears by <HI>F. Nat. Br. fol. 177. d, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Lastly, They may be called <HI>Assises,</HI> because they are tried most commonly by especial Courts, set and appoint∣ed for the purpose, as may be well proved, not onely out of the <HI>Customary</HI> of <HI>Normandy,</HI> but our Books also: Which shew, That in
<PB REF="17"/>
ancient times Justices were appointed by spe∣cial Commission, to dispatch Controversies of Possession, one or more, in this or that onely County, as occasion fell out, or Disseisins were offered, and that as well in Term time, as out of Term: Whereas of later days, we see that all these Commissions of Assises, of <HI>Eyr,</HI> of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> of <HI>Goal-delivery,</HI> and of <HI>Nisi prius,</HI> are dispatched all at one time, by two several Circuits in the year, out of term, and by such as have the greatest sway of Justice, being all of them the Kings Justices of either Bench, <HI>Barons</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> or <HI>Serjeants</HI> at Law.</P>
<P><HI>Assise,</HI> In the second signi sication, ac od∣ing to <HI>Littleton,</HI> is used for a Jury. For (to use his own example) it is set down in the be∣ginning of the Record of an Assise of <HI>Novel Disseisin, Assisa venit recognitura,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>Juratores veniunt recognituri.</HI> He gives this reason why the Jury is called an Assise, Because, by Writ of Assise, the Sheriff is commanded, <HI>Quod faciat duodecim liberos &amp; legales homines de viceneto, &amp;c. Videre Tene∣mentum illud, &amp; nomina eorum imbrevtari, &amp; quod summoneat eos per bonas summonitiones, quod sint coram Justiciariis, &amp;c. parati inde fa∣cere recognitionem, &amp;c.</HI> This is (as if he should have spoken shorter) <HI>Metonymia effecti.</HI> For they are called the <HI>Assises,</HI> because they are summoned by vertue of the Writ so termed. And yet the jury summoned upon a Writ of Right, is likewise called the <HI>Assise,</HI> as himself there confesseth. Which Writ of Right is not an Assise; but this may be said to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or abusively so termed. Assise in this signification is divided <HI>In magnam &amp; parvam. Glanvile, lib. 2. cap. 6 &amp; 7, &amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 12. Where it appears, wherein the Great Assise differs from the Petit Assise. The for∣mer four kindes of Assises used in Actions onely Possessory, are called <HI>Petit Assises,</HI> in respect of the Grand Assise. For the Law of Fees is grounded upon two Rights: One of Posseshon, the other, of Property. And as the <HI>Grand As∣sise</HI> serves for the Right of Property; so the <HI>Petit Assise</HI> serves for the Right of Possession. <HI>Horns Mirror of Justices, lib. 2. cap. De Novel Disseisin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Assise</HI> in the third signification, according to <HI>Littleton;</HI> is an Ordinance or Statute of <HI>Assise;</HI> as the Statute of <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> made <HI>Anno 51 Hen.</HI> 3. is termed the <HI>Assise</HI> of Bread and Ale <HI>(Assisa panis &amp; cervisiae) Reg. of Writ, fol. 279. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Assise of the Forest <HI>(Assisa de Foresta)</HI></HI> Is a Statute or Condition, touching orders to be observed in the Kings Forest. <HI>Manwood, part. 1. pag. 35. Crompton</HI> in the Court of Justices of the Forest, <HI>per totum, fol. 146. &amp; seq.</HI> And the <HI>Assise of the King, Anno 18 Edw. 1. Stat.</HI> 1. called <HI>The Statute for view of Frank-Pledge.</HI> And these are called <HI>Assises,</HI> because they set down and appoint a certain measure, rate, or or∣der in the things they concern. Of <HI>Assise,</HI> in this signification, <HI>Glanvile</HI> also speaks, <HI>Lib. 9. cap. 10. in fine. Generaliter verum est quod de quolibet placito quod in comitatu deducitur &amp; terminatur, misericordia quae inde provenit, vicecomiti debe∣tur. Quae quanta sit, per nullam assisam gene∣ralem determinatum est.</HI> And thus much touch∣ing <HI>Littletons</HI> Division.</P>
<P>But if we mark well the Writers of the Law, we shall finde this word <HI>(Assise)</HI> more diversly used, then this Author hath noted. For it is sometime used for the measure or quantity it self, (and that <HI>per Metonymiam ef∣fecti)</HI> because it is the very scantline described or commanded by the Ordinance: For exam∣ple, we say, When Wheat, &amp;c. is of this price, then the Bread, &amp;c. shall be of this <HI>Assise.</HI> This word is farther taken, for the whole Pro∣cess in Court upon the Writ of <HI>Assise,</HI> or for some part thereof, as the Issue or Verdict of the Jury. For example, <HI>Assises of Novel Disseisin, &amp;c. shall not be taken, but in their Shires, and after this manner, &amp;c.</HI> Mag. Char. cap. 12. And so it seems to signifie, <HI>Westm. 2. cap. 25. Anno 13 Edw.</HI> 1. in these words, <HI>Let the Disseisor alleage no false exceptions, whereby the taking of the</HI> Assises <HI>may be deferred, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Anno 34 Edw. 1. Stat. 2. if it be found by</HI> Assise; <HI>the</HI> Assise <HI>is arraigned; to aver by the</HI> Assise; <HI>the</HI> Assise <HI>by their default shall pass against them.</HI> And also <HI>Anno 1 Hen. 6. cap.</HI> 2. Assises <HI>awarded by default of the Tenants, &amp;c.</HI> Lastly, By <HI>Merton, cap. 4. Anno 20 Hen. 3. certified by the</HI> Assise; <HI>quit by the</HI> Assise, &amp;c. And in this signification <HI>Glanvile</HI> calls it <HI>Magnam Assisam domini Regis: quae ex duode∣cim ad minus legalium hominum Sacramentis con∣sistit,</HI> L. 2. c. 7. <HI>Bracton</HI> uses it in like sort, as, <HI>Assisa cadit in transgressionem, &amp; Assisa cadit in perambulationem L. 4. c. 30, 31. Fleta</HI> defines an <HI>Assise,</HI> in this signification, thus. Assisa <HI>in jure possessorio, est quaedam recognitio duodecim hominum juratorum, per quam Justiciarii certiorantur de articulis in brevi contentis.</HI> And <HI>Assise</HI> also, thus signifying, is said sometime to pass <HI>(per modum assisae)</HI> and sometime <HI>in modum juratae;</HI> in manner of an Assise, when onely the Dissesin in question, is put to the tryal of the Twelve; in manner of a Jury, when any exception is ob∣jected to disable the interest of the Disseisee, and is put to be tryed by the Twelve, before the Assise can pass.</P>
<P><HI>Assise</HI> in this signification, is taken four ways, <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 105. The first is <HI>As∣sise at large,</HI> which is taken as well upon other Points, as upon the Disseisin. For example, where an Infant brings an Assise, and the Deed of his Ancestor is pleaded, whereby he claims his Right or founds his Title, then the <HI>Assise</HI> shall be taken at large: That is, the Jury shall enquire not onely whether the Plaintiff were disseised, or not, by the Tenant, but also of these Points, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether his Ancestor were of full age, of good memory, and out of Pri∣son, when he made the Deed, pleaded. An∣other example, You may read in <HI>Littleton, cap. Estates upon Condition.</HI> The second manner is, when the Tenant, as it were, setting foot to foot with the Demandant, without farther</P>

have prsented a Clerk to a Church, and after (the Church being void by his death, or other∣wise) a stranger presents his Clerk to the same Church, in my disturbance. And how other∣wise this Writ is used. See <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. tract. 2. Register of Writs, fol. 30. Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 195.</P>
<P><HI>Assise de utrum <HI>(Assisa utrum)</HI></HI> Lies for a Parson against a Lay-man, or a Lay-man against a Parson, for Land or Tencment doubtful, Whe∣ther it be Lay-fee, or Free-alms. And of this see <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. tract. 5. cap. 1. &amp; seq. Britton, cap.</HI> 95. The reason why these Writs are cal∣led <HI>Assises,</HI> may be divers. First, because they settle the Possession, and so an outward right in him that obtains by them. Secondly, They were originally executed at a certain time and place formerly appointed. For by the <HI>Norman</HI> Law, the time and place must be known forty days before the Justices sit on them: And by our Law there must be likewise fifteen days of preparation, except they be tried in the standing Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> as appears by <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol. 177. d, e.</HI> Lastly, They may be called <HI>Assises,</HI> because they are tried most commonly by especial Courts, set and appoint∣ed for the purpose, as may be well proved, not onely out of the <HI>Customary</HI> of <HI>Normandy,</HI> but our Books also: Which shew, That in ancient times Justices were appointed by spe∣cial Commission, to dispatch Controversies of Possession, one or more, in this or that onely County, as occasion fell out, or Disseisins were offered, and that as well in Term time, as out of Term: Whereas of later days, we see that all these Commissions of <HI>Assises,</HI> of <HI>Eyr,</HI> of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> of <HI>Goal-delivery,</HI> and of <HI>Nisi prius,</HI> are dispatched all at one time, by two several Circuits in the year, out of term, and by such as have the greatest sway of Justice, being all of them the Kings Justices of either Bench, <HI>Barons</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> or <HI>Serjeants</HI> at Law.</P>
<P><HI>Assise,</HI> In the second signification, accord∣ing to <HI>Littleton,</HI> is used for a Jury. For (to use his own example) it is set down in the be∣ginning of the Record of an Assise of <HI>Novel Disseisin, Assisa venit recognitura,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>Juratores veniunt recognituri.</HI> He gives this reason why the Jury is called an <HI>Assise;</HI> Because, by Writ of Assise, the Sheriff is commanded, <HI>Quod faciat duodecim liberos &amp; legales homines de viceneto, &amp;c. Videre Tene∣mentum illud, &amp; nomina eorum imbreviari, &amp; quod summoneat eos per bonas summonitiones, quod sint coram Justiciariis, &amp;c. parati inde fa∣cere recognitionem, &amp;c.</HI> This is (as if he should have spoken shorter) <HI>Metonymia effecti.</HI> For they are called the <HI>Assises,</HI> because they are summoned by vertue of the Writ so termed. And yet the jury summoned upon a Writ of Right, is likewise called the <HI>Assise,</HI> as himself there confesseth. Which Writ of Right is not an Assise; but this may be said to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or abusively so termed. <HI>Assise</HI> in this signification is divided <HI>In magnam &amp; parvam. Glanvile, lib. 2. cap. 6 &amp; 7, &amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 12. Where it appears, wherein the Great Assise differs from the Petit Assise. The for∣mer four kindes of Assises used in Actions onely Possessory, are called <HI>Petit Assises,</HI> in respect of the <HI>Grand Assise.</HI> For the Law of Fees is grounded upon two Rights: One of Possession, the other, of Property. And as the <HI>Grand As∣sise</HI> serves for the Right of Property; so the <HI>Petit Assise</HI> serves for the Right of Possession. <HI>Horns Mirror of Justices, lib. 2. cap. De Novel Disseisin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Assise</HI> in the third signification, according to <HI>Littleton,</HI> is an Ordinance or Statute of <HI>Assise;</HI> as the Statute of <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> made <HI>Anno 51 Hen.</HI> 3. is termed the <HI>Assise</HI> of Bread and Ale <HI>(Assisa panis &amp; cervifiae) Reg. of Writ, fol. 279. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Assise of the Forest <HI>(Assisa de Foresta)</HI></HI> Is a Statute or Condition, touching orders to be observed in the Kings Forest. <HI>Manwood, part. 1. pag. 35. Crompton</HI> in the Court of Justices of the Forest, <HI>per totum, fol. 146. &amp; seq.</HI> And <HI>Assise of the King, Anno 18 Edw. 1. Stat.</HI> 1. called <HI>The Statute for view of Frank-Pledge.</HI> These are called <HI>Assises,</HI> because they set down and appoint a certain measure, rate, or or∣der in the things they concern. Of <HI>Assise,</HI> in this signification, <HI>Glanvile</HI> also speaks, <HI>Lib. 9. cap. 10. in fine. Generaliter verum est quod de quolibet placito quod in comitatu deducitur &amp; terminatur, misericordia, quae in de provenit, vicecomiti debe∣tur: Quae quanta sit; per nullam assisam gene∣ralem determinatum est.</HI> And thus much touch∣ing <HI>Littletons</HI> Division.</P>
<P>But if we mark well the Writers of the Law, we shall finde this word <HI>(Assise)</HI> more diversly used, then this Author hath noted. For it is sometime used for the measure or quantity it self, (and that <HI>per Metonymiam ef∣fecti)</HI> because it is the very scantline described or commanded by the Ordinance: For exam∣ple, we say, When Wheat, &amp;c. is of this price, then the Bread, &amp;c. shall be of this <HI>Assise.</HI> This word is further taken, for the whole Pro∣cess in Court upon the Writ of <HI>Assise,</HI> or for some part thereof, as the Issue or Verdict of the Jury. For example, <HI>Assises of Novel Disseisin, &amp;c. shall not be taken, but in their Shires, and after this manner, &amp;c.</HI> Mag. Char. cap. 12. And so it seems to signifie, <HI>Westm. 2. cap. 25. Anno 13 Edw.</HI> 1. in these words, <HI>Let the Disseisor alleage no false exceptions, whereby the taking of the Assises may be deferred, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Anno 34 Edw. 1. Stat. 2. if it be found by</HI> Assise; <HI>the</HI> Assise <HI>is arraigned; to aver by the</HI> Assise; <HI>the</HI> Assise <HI>by their default shall pass against them.</HI> And also <HI>Anno 1 Hen. 6. cap.</HI> 2. Assises <HI>awarded by default of the Tenants, &amp;c.</HI> Lastly, By <HI>Merton, cap. 4. Anno 20 Hen. 3. certified by the</HI> Assise; <HI>quit by the</HI> Assise, &amp;c. And in this signification <HI>Glanvile</HI> calls it <HI>Magnam Assisam domini Regis: quae ex duode∣cim ad minus legalium hominum Sacramentis con∣sistit,</HI> L. 2. c. 7. <HI>Bracton</HI> uses it in like sort, as, <HI>Assisa cadit in transgressionem, &amp; Assisa cadit in perambulationem L. 4. c. 30, 31. Fleta</HI> defines an

<HI>Assise,</HI> in this signification, thus. Assisa <HI>in jure possessorio, est quaedam recognitio duodecim hominum juratorum, per quam Justiciarii certiorantur de articulis in brevi contentis.</HI> And <HI>Assise</HI> also, thus signifying, is said sometime to pass <HI>(per modum assisae)</HI> and sometime <HI>in modum juratae;</HI> in manner of an Assise, when onely the Disseisin in question, is put to the tryal of the Twelve; in manner of a Jury, when any exception is ob∣jected to disable the interest of the Disseisee, and is put to be tryed by the Twelve, before the Assise can pass.</P>
<P><HI>Assise</HI> in this signification, is taken four ways, <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 105. The first is <HI>As∣sise at large,</HI> which is taken as well upon other Points, as upon the Disseisin. For example, where an Infant brings an Assise, and the Deed of his Ancestor is pleaded, whereby he claims his Right or founds his Title; then the <HI>Assise</HI> shall be taken at large: That is, the Jury shall enquire not onely whether the Plaintiff were disseised, or not, by the Tenant, but also of these Points, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether his Ancestor were of full age, of good memory, and out of Pri∣son, when he made the Deed, pleaded. An∣other example, You may read in <HI>Littleton, cap. Estates upon Condition.</HI> The second manner is, when the Tenant, as it were, setting foot to foot with the Demandant, without farther circumstance, pleads directly contrary to the Writ, <HI>no wrong, no disseisin.</HI> The third is, When the Tenant alleageth something by ex∣ception that must be tried by a Jury, before the principal cause can proceed: As if he plead Forein Release, or Forein Matter tryable in another County. For, in this case, the Justices refer the Record to the Court of <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> for tryal of the Forein Pleas, before the Dis∣seisin can come to be decussed. Of this sort read divers other examples in <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. part. 1. cap</HI> 34. For there are of them (as he saith, and <HI>Britton</HI> also, <HI>cap.</HI> 52.) both dilatory and peremptory. The fourth and last manner is, <HI>Assise of Right of Damages;</HI> that is, when the Tenant, confessing an <HI>Ouster,</HI> and referring it to a Demurrer in Law, whether it were right∣ly done or not, is adjudged to have done wrong. For then shall the Demandant have a Writ to recover damages, called an <HI>Assise to recover damages,</HI> as also the whole Process.</P>
<P><HI>Assise,</HI> is further taken for the Court, place, or time, when and where the Writs and Processes of the <HI>Assise</HI> are handled or taken: And in this signification <HI>Assise</HI> is general; as when the Justices go their several Cir∣cuits, with their Commission, to take all <HI>As∣sises</HI> twice in the year, that is called the <HI>Gene∣ral Assise.</HI> It may likewise, in this signification, be <HI>special;</HI> as if an especial Commission be granted to certain persons (as was often done in ancient time, <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. cap.</HI> 11.) for taking an <HI>Assise</HI> upon one Disseisin or two; this would be called a <HI>Special Assise.</HI> And in this very signification, <HI>Glanvile</HI> uses it, <HI>Lib. 9. cap</HI> 12. See <HI>Cokes, 4 Inst. fol.</HI> 158.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>General Assise,</HI> in the most usual signification, thus the Learned Sir <HI>Fr. Bacon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ALl the Counties of this Realm</HI> (says he) <HI>are divided into six Circuits, and two Learned Men are assigned by the Kings Commission to every Circuit, who ride twice a year through those Shires allotted to that Circuit; these we call</HI> Justices <HI>or</HI> Judges of Assise, <HI>who have five several Commis∣sions by which they sit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The first is a Commission of</HI> Oyer <HI>and</HI> Ter∣miner <HI>directed to them, and many others of the best account in their Circuits. But in this Com∣mission the Judges of</HI> Assise <HI>are of the</HI> Quorum; <HI>so as without them, there can be no proceeding. This Commission gives them power to deal with Treasons, Murders, and all manner of Felonics and Misdemeanors; and this is their largest Commission.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The second is of</HI> Goal Delivery, <HI>and that onely to the Judges themselves, and the Clerk of the</HI> Assise Associate; <HI>by this Commission they are to deal with every Prisoner in Goal, for what offence soever he be there.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The third Commission is directed to themselves onely, and the Clerk of</HI> Assise, <HI>to take</HI> Assises, <HI>by which they are called</HI> Justices of Assise; <HI>and the Office of these Justices, is to do right upon Writs called</HI> Assise, <HI>brought before them by such as are wrongfully thrust out of their Lands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The fourth Commission is to take</HI> Nisi Prius, <HI>directed to none but the Judgee themselves, and their Clerks of</HI> Assises; <HI>by which they are called</HI> Justices of Nisi Prius.</P>
<P><HI>The fifth is a</HI> Commission of Peace <HI>in every County of their Circuit. And all the Justices of Peace, having no lawful impediment, are bound to be present at the</HI> Assises, <HI>to attend the Judges, as occasion shall fall out; if any make default, the Judges may set a Fine upon him at their plea∣sure and discretions. The Sheriff of every Shire is also to attend in person, or by a sufficient De∣puty, allowed by the Judges, who may Fine him, if he fail, &amp;c.</HI> See more in Sir <HI>Fr. Bacons</HI> Use of the Law, <HI>fol. 13. usque</HI> 21.</P>
<P><HI>Assisa Continuanda,</HI> Is a Writ directed to the Justices assigned to take an <HI>Assise,</HI> for the <HI>continuance</HI> of the Cause, in case where certain Records alleaged, cannot in time be procured by the party that would use them, <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol.</HI> 217.</P>
<P><HI>Assisa Proroganda,</HI> Is a Writ directed to the Justices of <HI>Assise,</HI> for stay of proceeding, by reason of the Kings business, wherein the party is employed. <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol. 208, &amp;</HI> 221.</P>

<P><HI>Assumpsit</HI> (from <HI>Assumo)</HI> Is a voluntary promise made by word, whereby a man assumes or takes upon him to pay or perform any thing to another.

<P><HI>Attache, <HI>(attachiare.</HI></HI> From the Fr. <HI>attacher, i. figere, nectere, alligare)</HI> Signifies to take or apprehend by Commandment or Writ. <HI>Lamb.</HI> (in his <HI>Eiren. lib. 1. cap.</HI> 16.) makes this differ∣ence between an <HI>Arrest,</HI> and an <HI>Attachment,</HI> that an <HI>Arrest</HI> proceeds out of an Inferior Court by Precept, and an <HI>Attachment</HI> out of higher Courts, by Precept or Writ; and that a Precept to Arrest, hath these formal words, <HI>Duci facias, &amp;c.</HI> And a Writ of <HI>Attachment</HI> these, <HI>Praecipimus tibi quod</HI> attachies <HI>talem &amp; habeas cum coram nobis, &amp;c.</HI> Whereby it ap∣pears, that he, who Arrests, carries the party Arrested to another higher person to be dis∣posed of forthwith; he that <HI>attacheth,</HI> keeps the party attached, and presents him in Court at the day assigned in the <HI>Attachment.</HI> Yet an <HI>Attachment</HI> sometimes issues out of a Court Baron, which is an Inferior Court, <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 79. There is another difference, in that an Arrest lies onely upon the Body of a Man, and an <HI>Attachment</HI> sometimes on his Goods; which makes it in that particular differ from a <HI>Capias,</HI> in being more general: For, a man may be <HI>attached</HI> by an hundred Sheep <HI>(Kitchin, fol.</HI> 263.) but the <HI>Capias</HI> takes hold of the Body onely. See <HI>Skene, Verbo, Attachiamentum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Attachment by Writ,</HI> differs from a Distress or <HI>Distringas</HI> in this, That an <HI>Attachment</HI> reacheth not to Lands, as a Distress doth, and that a Distress toucheth not the Body (if it be properly taken) as an <HI>Attachment</HI> doth, yet are they divers times confounded, as may ap∣pear by <HI>Glanvil, lib. 10. cap.</HI> 3. and <HI>Fleta, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 66. Howbeit, in the most common use, an <HI>Attachment</HI> is an apprehension of a Man by his Body, to bring him to answer the Action of the Plaintiff. A <HI>Distress,</HI> without a Writ, is the taking of a Mans Goods for some real cause, as Rent, Service, or the like, whereby to force him to Replevy, and so to be Plaintuff in an Action of <HI>Trespass</HI> against him that distrained him. See <HI>Distress.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Attachment out of the Chancery,</HI> is had of course, upon an <HI>Affidavit</HI> made, That the De∣fendant was served with a <HI>Subpaena,</HI> and appears not, or issueth upon not performing some Order or Decree. After the return of this <HI>Attachment</HI> by the Sheriff, <HI>Quod non est inventus in Baliva sua</HI>—Another <HI>Attachment with Proclama∣tion</HI> issues out against him; and if he appears not thereupon, then a <HI>Writ of Rebellion. West. part. 2. Symbol, tit. Proceedings in Chancery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Attachment of Priviledge,</HI> Is by vertue of a Mans Priviledge, to call another to that Court, whereto he himself belongs; and in respect whereof he is priviledged, to answer some Action. <HI>New Book of Entries.</HI> Verbo, <HI>Priviledge, fol.</HI> 431.</P>
<P><HI>Forein Attachment,</HI> Is an Attachment of Goods or Money, found within a Liberty or City, to satisfie some Creditor of his within such City or Liberty. And, by the Custom of some places, as <HI>London, &amp;c.</HI> a Man may <HI>attach</HI> Money or Goods in the hands of a Stranger, whilest he is within their Liberty. As if <HI>A</HI> ows <HI>B</HI> 10 l. and <HI>C</HI> ows <HI>A</HI> 10 l. <HI>B</HI> may <HI>attach</HI> this 10 l. in the hands of <HI>C,</HI> to satisfie himself for the Debt due from <HI>A.</HI> See <HI>Calthrops Re∣ports, pag.</HI> 66.</P>
<P>There is likewise an <HI>Attachment of the Forest,</HI> which is one of the Three Courts there held; The lowest is called the <HI>Attachment;</HI> the mean, <HI>Swainmote;</HI> the highest, the <HI>Justice in Eyrs seat.</HI> This <HI>Court of Attachment</HI> seems to be so called, because the <HI>Verderors</HI> of the Forest have therein no other Authorty, but to receive the <HI>Attachments</HI> of Offenders against Vert and Venison, taken by the rest of the Officers, and to enrol them, that they may be presented or punished at the next <HI>Justice Seat.

<P><HI>Attaint <HI>(attincta)</HI></HI> As it is a Substantive, is used for a Writ, that lies after Judgment, against a Jury, that hath given a false Verdict in any Court of Record (be the Action Real or Personal) if the Debt or Damages surmount the sum of 40 s. What the Form of the Writ is, and how in use, is expressed in <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 105. and <HI>New Book of Entries, fol.</HI> 84. The reason why it is so called, is because the party that obtains it, endeavors thereby to <HI>touch</HI> or <HI>stain</HI> the Jury with Perjury, by whose Verdict he is grieved: And if the Verdict be found false, then the Judgment anciently was, That the Jurors Meadows should be ploughed up, their Houses broke down, their Woods grubbed up, and all their Lands and Tenements forfeited to the King: But if it pass against him that brought the <HI>Attaint,</HI> he shall be im∣prisoned and grievously ransomed at the Kings Will. See <HI>Glanvile, lib. 2. cap. 19. Smith de Repub. Angl. lib. 3 cap. 2. 11 Hen. 7. cap. 21 &amp; 23 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 3.

<P><HI>Attainted <HI>(attinctus)</HI></HI> Is used particularly for such as are found guilty of some crime or offence, and especially of Felony or Treason. Yet a Man is said to be <HI>attainted</HI> of Disseisin. <HI>Westm. 1. cap. 24, &amp; 36. Anno 3 Edw.</HI> 1. And so it is taken in <HI>French,</HI> as <HI>Estre attaint &amp; vayn∣cu en aucun case, i.</HI> to be cast in any case. <HI>Britton. cap.</HI> 75. uses the Participle <HI>Attaint,</HI> in the sence we say <HI>attained unto.</HI> A Man is <HI>attainted</HI> by two means, by Appearance, or by Process. <HI>Stanf. Pl. Cor. fol. 44. Attainder</HI> by Appearance is by Confession, by Battle, or by Verdict. <HI>Confession</HI> (whereof <HI>Attaint</HI> grows) is twofold; one at the Bar before the Judges, when the Pri∣soner, upon his Indictment read, being asked <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty,</HI> answers <HI>guilty,</HI> never put∣ting himself upon the Jury; the other is, be∣fore the Coroner in Sanctuary, where he upon his Confession, was, in former times constrain∣ed to abjure the Realm, which kinde also, of the effect, is called <HI>Attainder by Abjuration, Stanf. fol. 182. Attainder by Battle,</HI> is when the party, appealed by another, and chusing to try the truth by Combat, rather then by Jury, is vanquished. <HI>Attainder by Verdict,</HI> is when the Prisoner at the Bar, answering <HI>not guilty</HI> to the Indictment, hath an Enquest of Life and Death passing upon him, and is, by their Ver∣dict, pronounced guilty. <HI>Idem, f. 108 &amp; 192. At∣tainder by Process,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Attainder by Default,</HI> or <HI>Attainder by Outlary,</HI> is where a party flies, or doth not appear, until he hath been five times called publickly in the County Court, and at last upon his default is pronounced or returned <HI>Outlawed.</HI> The same Author <HI>(fol.</HI> 108.) makes a difference between <HI>Attainder</HI> and <HI>Con∣viction;</HI> with whom agrees the Statute, <HI>Anno 34 &amp; 35 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 14. and <HI>Anno 1 Edw. 6. cap.</HI> 12. in these words, <HI>That then every such Offender, being duly thereof convicted or attainted by the Laws of this Realm, &amp;c.</HI> And I finde by <HI>Stanf. (Pl. Cor. fol.</HI> 66.) That a Man by our ancient Laws, was said to be <HI>con∣victed</HI> presently upon the Verdict <HI>(guilty,)</HI> but not to be <HI>attainted,</HI> until it appeared he was no Clerk, or being a Clerk, and demanded by his Ordinary, could not purge himself. And in one word it appears, That <HI>Attainder</HI> is larger then <HI>Conviction; Conviction</HI> being onely by the Jury: And <HI>Attainder</HI> is not before Judgment. <HI>Perkins, Grants, num.</HI> 27, 29. Yet it appears by <HI>Stanf. fol.</HI> 9. that <HI>Conviction</HI> is sometimes called <HI>Attainder:</HI> For there he says, the Verdict of the Jury does either acquit or <HI>attaint</HI> a Man. And so it is, <HI>Westm. 1. cap.</HI> 14. This ancient Law touching the Conviction and Purgation of Clerks is altered by 23 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 2. as you may read in <HI>Clergy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Attainder <HI>(attincta</HI></HI> and <HI>attinctura)</HI> Is when a Man hath committed Treason or Felony, and after Conviction, Judgment hath passed upon him. The Children of a person <HI>Attainted</HI> of Treason cannot be Heirs to him, or any other Ancestor. And if he were noble and gentle be∣fore, he and his posterity are made base and ignoble: This corruption of Blood cannot be salved, but by Act of Parliament. See <HI>At∣tainted,</HI> and <HI>Felony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Attendant <HI>(attendens)</HI></HI> Signifies one that ows a duty or service to another, or depends on him. For example, there is <HI>Lord, Mesn,</HI> and <HI>Tenant,</HI> the <HI>Tenant</HI> holds of the <HI>Mesn</HI> by a penny, the <HI>Mesn</HI> holds over by two pence: The <HI>Mesn</HI> releases to the <HI>Tenant</HI> all the right he hath in the Land, and the Tenant dies; his Wife shall be endowed of the Land, and she shall be <HI>Attendant</HI> to the Heir of the third part of the penny, and not of the third part of the two pence. For she shall be endowed of the best Possession of her Husband. And, where the Wife is endowed by the Guardian, she shall be <HI>At∣tendant</HI> to the Guardian, and to the Heir at his full age. <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 209.

It comes from the Fr. <HI>Attermoye, i.</HI> That hath a term or time granted for the payment of a debt. So in this <HI>Statute,</HI> it seems, to signifie the Purcha∣sing or gaining a longer time for payment of a debt. <HI>Atterminent quaerentes usque in proximum Parliamentum, Westm. 2. cap.</HI> 24.</P>
<P><HI>Atturney <HI>(atturnatus)</HI></HI> Is he that is ap∣pointed by another Man to do any thing in his stead; as much as <HI>Procurator</HI> or <HI>Syndicus</HI> in the <HI>Civil Law. West</HI> defines them thus, <HI>Atturneys are such persons as by the Consent, Commandment, or Request of others, see to, and take upon them the charge of their business, part. 1. Symbol. lib. 2. sect.</HI> 559. In ancient time, those of Authority in Courts, had it in their power, whether to
<PB REF="20"/>
suffer men to appear, or sue by another then themselves, as is evident by <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 25. in the Writ <HI>Dedimus potestatem de Attor∣nato faciendo,</HI> where it is shewed, That Men were driven to procure the Kings Writs or Letters Patent to appoint <HI>Atturneys</HI> for them; but it is since provided by Statutes, that it should be lawful so to do, without any such circuit, as appears by 20 <HI>Hen. 3. cap. 10.—6 Edw. 1. c. 8.—27 ejusdem, Stat. 2.—12 Edw. 2. cap. 1.—15 ejusdem, cap. unico.—7 Rich. 2. cap. 14.—7 Hen. 4. cap. 13.—3 Hen. 5. cap. 2.—15 Hen. 6. cap.</HI> 7. and 17 <HI>Hen. 7. cap.</HI> 2. And you may see great diversity of Writs in the Table of the <HI>Register,</HI> wherein the King by his Writ commands the Judges to admit of <HI>At∣turneys;</HI> whereby there grew at last so many unskilful <HI>Atturneys,</HI> and so many mischiefs by them; that for restraining them, it was enacted (4 <HI>Hen. 4. cap.</HI> 18.) that the Justices should ex∣amine them, and displace the unskilful. And again, (33 <HI>Hen. 6. cap.</HI> 7.) that there should be but a certain number of them in <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI> In what cases a Man at this day may have an <HI>Atturney,</HI> and in what not, see <HI>Fitz. ubi supra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Atturney</HI> is either general, or special. <HI>At∣turney General</HI> is he, who by general Authority is appointed to manage all our Affairs or Suits; As the <HI>Atturney General of the King,</HI> which is as much as <HI>Procurator Caesaris</HI> was in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. <HI>Atturney General</HI> of the Duke. <HI>Cromp. Juris. fol. 105. Atturney Special</HI> or <HI>Particular,</HI> is he that is employed in one or more causes particularly specified; of whom you may read more at large in <HI>Glanvile, lib. 11. cap.</HI> 1. and <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 126. There are also, in respect of the divers Courts, <HI>Atturneys at large,</HI> and <HI>Atturneys special,</HI> belonging to this, or that Court onely. The name is borrowed of the <HI>Normans,</HI> as appears by the <HI>Customary, cap.</HI> 65. Our old Latin word for it, seems to be <HI>Respon∣salis. Bracton, lib. 4. cap.</HI> 31.</P>
<P><HI>Atturney of the Court of the Dutchy of</HI> Lan∣caster <HI>(Atturnatus Curiae Ducatus</HI> Lancastriae) Is the second Officer in that Court, and seems, for his skill in Law, to be there placed as <HI>As∣sessor</HI> to the Chancellor of that Court, being for the most part some Honorable Person, and chosen rather for some especial trust, reposed in him, to deal between the King and his Te∣nants, than for any great Learning; as was u∣sual with the Emperors of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the choice of their Magistrates.</P>
<P><HI>Attournment</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Tourner, i. ver∣tere)</HI> Is an acknowledgment of the Tenant to a new Lord. As when one is Tenant for Life, and he in Reversion, grants his right to another, it is necessary the Tenant for Life agree thereto, which is called <HI>Attornment,</HI> without which no∣thing passeth by the grant. But if the Grant be by Fine in Court of Record, he shall be com∣pelled to <HI>Attourn. Stat. 27 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 16. The words used in <HI>Attournment</HI> are these, <HI>I agree me to the Grant made to you,</HI> or (more commonly) <HI>Sir, I attourn to you by force of the same Grant;</HI> or, <HI>I become your Tenant,</HI> or de∣liver to the Grantee a penny by way of <HI>At∣tournment. Littl. lib. 3. cap. Attournment,</HI> where you may finde divers other Cases, where∣to <HI>Attournment</HI> appertains, and that it is the transposing those duties, which the Tenant owed his former Lord, to another, as his Lord. <HI>Attournment</HI> is either by word, or by act, vo∣luntary or compulsory, by the Writ <HI>Per quae servitia, (Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 155.) or sometimes by Distress. <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 147. It may be made to the Lord himself, or to his Steward in Court. <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 70. There is <HI>Attournment in Deed,</HI> and <HI>Attournment in Law. Coke, vol. 6. fol. 113. a. Attournment in Law</HI> is an Act, which though it be no express <HI>Attournment,</HI> yet in intendment of Law, it is of equal force. <HI>Coke on Littl. fol.</HI> 309.</P>
<P><HI>Atturnato faciendo vel recipiendo,</HI> Is a Writ, which a Man owing sute to a County, Hundred, or other Court, and desiring to make an <HI>Atturney</HI> to appear for him there (whom he doubts the Sheriff or Steward will not otherwise admit) purchaseth, to command him to receive such a Man for his <HI>Atturney,</HI> and admit his appearance by him.

<P><HI>Audience Court <HI>(Curia Audientiae Can∣tuariensis)</HI></HI> Is a Court belonging to the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> of equal authority with the <HI>Arches,</HI> though inferior, both in Dignity, and Antiquity, and is held in the Archbishops Palace.

This Writ is granted by the Lord Chancelor of <HI>England</HI> (upon view of the Exception sug∣gested) to the Judges of either Bench, willing them to grant Summons to the Sheriff of the County, where the Creditor is, for his appear∣ance

<P><HI>Auditor</HI> (Lat.) Is an Officer of the King, or some other great personage, who yearly, by examining the Accompts of all under Officers accomptable, makes up a general Book; which shews the difference between their Re∣ceipts or Charge, and their Allowances, com∣monly called <HI>Allocations.</HI> As namely, the <HI>Au∣ditors</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> take the Accompts of those Receivers, who receive the Revenues of the Augmentation, as also of the Sheriffs, Es∣cheators, Collectors, and Customers. Of which, see the Statute 33 <HI>Hen. 8. c.</HI> 83. and 4 <HI>part. Inst. fol.</HI> 106.</P>
<P><HI>Auditor of the Prests</HI> or <HI>Imprests,</HI> Are also Officers in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> who take and make up the great Accompts of <HI>Ireland, Ber∣wick,</HI> the Mint, and of any Money imprested to any Man for His Majesties service. See <HI>Practise of the Exohequer, p.</HI> 83.</P>
<P><HI>Auditor of the Receipts,</HI> Is an Officer of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> who Files the Tellers Bills, and makes an Entry of them, and gives in every week to the Lord Treasurer, a Certificate of the Money received.

<P><HI>Aventure <HI>(rectiùs adventure)</HI></HI> Is a mis∣chance causing the death of a Man, without Felony; as when he is suddenly drowned or burnt, by any disease or mischance, falling in∣to the Water or Fire. <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 7. where you may read how it differs from <HI>Misadventure,</HI> which see.</P>
<P><HI>Avenage</HI> (Fr.) A certain quantity of Oats paid to a Land-lord in lieu of some other du∣ties, or as a Rent from the Tenant.</P>
<P><HI>Avenor</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>avene, i.</HI> Oats) Is an Officer of the Kings, who provides <HI>Oats</HI> for his Stable; and is mentioned <HI>Anno 13 Car. 2. cap.</HI> 8.</P>

<P><HI>Average <HI>(averagium,</HI></HI> from <HI>Averia, i.</HI> Cat∣tle) Signifies Service which the Tenant ows the King, or other Lord, by Horse or Ox, or by Carriage with either; For in ancient Charters of Priviledges, we finde <HI>Quietum esse de</HI> Ave∣ragiis. Others probably derive it from the French <HI>(euvrage</HI> or <HI>euvre, i. opus)</HI> It hath two significations: First, <HI>Rastal</HI> mentions the Kings <HI>Averages,</HI> which I take to be the Kings carriage by Horse or Cart. Then, <HI>Anno 32 H. 8. cap.</HI> 14. and 1 <HI>Jac. cap.</HI> 32. it is used for a certain contribution that Merchants and others, do proportionably make towards <HI>their</HI> losses, who have their Goods cast into the Sea for the safeguard of the Ship, or of the Goods and Lives of them in the Ship, in time of a Tem∣pest. And this contribution seems to be so cal∣led, because it is proportioned after the rate of every Mans <HI>Average,</HI> or Goods carried. In this last sence, it is also used in the Statute 14 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 27.</P>
<P><HI>Average,</HI> Is also a little duty, which those Merchants, who send Goods in another Mans Ship, do pay to the Master of it, for his care of them, over and above the Freight; for in Bills of Lading it is expressed—<HI>Paying</HI> so much <HI>Freight for the said Goods, with Frimage and</HI> A∣verage <HI>accustomed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Averiis captis in Withernam,</HI> Is a Writ, for taking Cattle to his use, who hath his Cattle unlawfully taken by another, and driven out of the County where they were taken, that they cannot be Replevied. <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol.</HI> 82. When mention is made of one Beast, we say, <HI>Quidam equus, vel quidam bos;</HI> when of two or more, we do not say <HI>Equi</HI> or <HI>boves,</HI> but <HI>tot averia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Averment <HI>(verificatio)</HI></HI> From the Fr. <HI>Ave∣rer, i. verificare, testari)</HI> Signifies commonly an offer of the Defendant, to make good or justifie an Exception pleaded in Abatement or Bar of the Plaintiffs Action; and it signifies the Act, as well as the offer of justifying the Exception. For, <HI>Anno 34 Edw. 1. Stat.</HI> 2. <HI>The Dema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ant will offer to</HI> aver <HI>by the Assise or Jury,</HI> &amp;c. In the English <HI>Nat. Br. fol. 57. These Er∣rors shall be tryed by</HI> Averment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in 15 <HI>Hen. 6. cap.</HI> 1. <HI>The Defendants shall have their</HI> Averment, <HI>to say, that,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Averment</HI> is twofold, <HI>viz. general</HI> and <HI>particular;</HI> a <HI>gene∣ral Averment,</HI> which is the conclusion of every Plea to the Writ, or in Bar of Replications, and other Pleadings (for Counts or Avowries in nature of Counts, need not be <HI>averred)</HI> con∣taining matter Affirmative, ought to be <HI>averred,</HI> with an <HI>hoc paratus est verificare, &amp;c. Particular Averment,</HI> is when the life of Tenant for Life, or Tenant in Tail is <HI>averred, &amp;c.</HI> And an <HI>A∣verment</HI> contains as well the matter as the Form thereof. <HI>Coke on Littl. fol. 362. b.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Averpeny <HI>(quasi average-peny)</HI></HI> Is Money contributed towards the Kings <HI>averages,</HI> or Money given to be freed thereof. <HI>Rastals Ex∣position of words.</HI> Averpeny, <HI>hoc est, quietum esse de diversis Denariis pro averagiis Domini Regis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Augmentation <HI>(augmentatio)</HI></HI> Was the name of a Court, erected 27 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. as appears by the Twenty seventh Chapter of that years Parliament; to this end, that the King might be justly dealt with, touching the profit of such Religious Houses and their Lands, as were given him by Act of Parliament the same year, not Printed. For dissolving which Court, there was authority given Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by the Par∣liament held the first of Her Reign. <HI>Sess. 2 Ca.</HI> 10. Which She afterwards put in execution by Her Letters Patent. The Court took name from this, That the Revenue of the Crown was thought to be much <HI>augmented</HI> by the suppressi∣on of the said Houses, many of which, the King reserved to the Crown.</P>

The reason why it is called <HI>Bail,</HI> is, Because by this means the party Re∣strained, is <HI>delivered</HI> into the hands of those that bind themselves for his forth-coming. There is both <HI>common</HI> and <HI>special Bail; Common Bail</HI> is in Actions of small prejudice or concern∣ment, being called <HI>Common,</HI> because any Sure∣ties in that case, are taken; whereas in Causes of greater weight, as Actions upon Bond or Specialty, <HI>Special Bail</HI> or Surety must be taken, as Subsidy Men at least, and they ac∣cording to the value. <HI>Manwood,</HI> in his first part of <HI>Forest Laws, pag.</HI> 167. says, there is a great diversity between <HI>Bail</HI> and <HI>Mainprise:</HI> For he that is <HI>Mainprised,</HI> is always said to be at large, and to go at his own Liberty out of Ward, from the time he is <HI>Mainprised,</HI> till the day of his appearance: But otherwise it is, where a Man is let to <HI>Bail</HI> by four or two Men, by the Lord Chief Justice in <HI>Eyre,</HI> until a cer∣tain day; for there he is always accounted by the Law, to be in their Ward, and custody for the time: And they may, if they will, keep him in Ward or Prison. So that he who is so <HI>bailed,</HI> shall not be said by the Law, to be at large, or at his own liberty. See <HI>Lamb. Eiren lib. 3. cap. 2. pag. 330. Bail</HI> is also a certain Limit within the Forest, as it is divided into the charges of several Foresters. <HI>Crompton</HI> in the Oath of <HI>Bow-bearer, fol.</HI> 201. See <HI>Mainprise,</HI> and 4 <HI>Instit. fol.</HI> 178.</P>
<P><HI>Bailiff <HI>(Balivus)</HI></HI> As the name, so the Office it self in ancient time was answerable to that of <HI>France,</HI> where there are Eight Parlia∣ments, which are high Courts, whence lies no Appeal; and within the Precincts of those se∣veral parts of that Kingdom, which belong to each Parliament, there are several Provinces, to which Justice is ministred by certain Officers called <HI>Bailiffs.</HI> So in <HI>England</HI> we see many several Counties, in which, Justice hath been ministred to the Inhabitants by the Officer, whom we now call <HI>Sheriff</HI> or <HI>Vicount</HI> (the one name descending from the <HI>Saxons,</HI> the other from the <HI>Normans.)</HI> And though I cannot ex∣presly prove, That this <HI>Sheriff</HI> was ever called a <HI>Bailiff,</HI> yet it is probable <HI>that</HI> was one of his names also; because the <HI>County</HI> is often called <HI>Baliva,</HI> a <HI>Bailywick.</HI> As namely, in the Re∣turn of a Writ, <HI>Non est inventus in Baliva mea, &amp;c. Kitchin Returna Brevium, fol.</HI> 285. And in the Sheriffs Oath, the County is called his <HI>Bailiwick.</HI> I think the word <HI>Bailiff</HI> used in <HI>Magna Chart. cap.</HI> 28. and 14 <HI>Edw. 3. Stat. 1. cap.</HI> 9. compriseth as well <HI>Sheriffs</HI> as <HI>Bailiffs</HI> of Hundreds. But as the Realin is divided into Counties, so every County is again divided in∣to Hundreds; within which, it is manifest, that in ancient time the Kings Subjects had justice ministred to them by the several Officers of every Hundred, which were called <HI>Bailiffs,</HI> as those Officers do in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> being cheif Officers of Justice within every Province. <HI>Grand Customary of Norm. cap.</HI> 1. And it appears by <HI>Bracton (lib. 3. tract. 2 cap. 34. num.</HI> 5.) that <HI>Bailiffs of Hundreds</HI> might hold Plea of Appeal and Approvers. But since that time these Hundred Courts (certain Franchises excepted) are by the said Statute of 14 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. swallowed into the County Courts, as you may read in <HI>County</HI> and <HI>Hundred.</HI> And now the <HI>Bailiffs</HI> name and office is grown into such contempt, at least these <HI>Bailiffs</HI> of Hundreds, that they are now but bare Mes∣sengers and Mandataries within their Liberties, to serve Writs, and such vile Offices; for which see <HI>Crompt. Just. of Peace, fol. 49. a.</HI> Yet is the name otherwise still in good esteem; for the chief Magistrates in divers Corporate Towns, are called <HI>Bailiffs,</HI> as of <HI>Ludlow, Leominster, &amp;c.</HI> And again, there are certain persons to whom the Kings Castles are commit∣ted, who are called <HI>Bailiffs,</HI> as the <HI>Bailiff</HI> of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle.</P>
<P>These ordinary <HI>Bailiffs</HI> are of two sorts, <HI>Bailiffs Errant,</HI> and <HI>Bailiffs of Franchises. Bai∣liffs
<PB REF="22"/>
Errant (Balivi Itinerantes)</HI> are those whom the Sheriff appoints to go up and down the County to serve Writs, Summon the County Sessions, Assises, and such like. <HI>Bailiffs of Franchises (Balivi Franchesiarum aut Liberta∣tum)</HI> are those who are appointed by every Lord within his Liberty, to do such Offices therein, as the <HI>Bailiff Errant</HI> does at large in the County. Of these read Sir <HI>Tho. Smith de Repub. Angl. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 16. There are also <HI>Bailiffs of the Forest (Manwood, part. 1. pag.</HI> 113.) and <HI>Bailiffs of Husbandry,</HI> belonging to private Men of good Estates, who are so called, be∣cause they dispose of the under servants, every Man to his labor and task, check them for mis∣doing their business, gather the profits to their Lord and Masters use, and deliver an account thereof at the years end, or otherwise as it shall be called for.</P>
<P>The Office or Duty of a <HI>Bailiff</HI> of a Manor, or Houshold (which in ancient time seems to have been all one.) <HI>Fleta</HI> well describes, <HI>Lib. 2. cap. 72 &amp;</HI> 73.

<P><HI>Ban</HI> or <HI>Bans <HI>(Bannum)</HI></HI> from the British <HI>Ban, <HI>i. Clamor,</HI></HI> Is a Proclamation or publick notice given of any thing. This word <HI>Bans</HI> we use in publishing Matrimonial Contracts in the Church, before Marriage, to the end, If any Man can speak against the intention of the parties, either in respect of Kinred, Pre-con∣tract, or otherwise, they may take their Ex∣ception in time. And in the Canon Law, <HI>Banna sunt Proclamationes sponsi &amp; sponsae in Ecclesiis fieri solitae.</HI> Yet our word <HI>Banning</HI> seems to come thence, being an Exclamation or Cursing. <HI>Bracton</HI> mentions <HI>Bannus Regis,</HI> for a Procla∣mation or Silence made by the Court, before the Congress of the Champions in a Combat, <HI>Lib. 3. tract. 2. cap. 21.—In terra suae ditionis</HI> Bannum, <HI>i.

<P><HI>Bane,</HI> (from the Sax. bana, A Killer or Murderer) Signifies the destruction or over∣throw of any thing; As I will be the <HI>Bane</HI> of him, is a common saying: And he who was the cause of another Mans drowning, is said to be <HI>Labane, i.

Smith</HI> in his <HI>Repub. Angl.</HI> Others add, That Blood must be first drawn in the Field. They are allowed to display their Arms in a <HI>Banner</HI> in the Kings Army, as <HI>Barons</HI> do. <HI>Camden</HI> in his <HI>Britan. fol.</HI> 109. hath these words, <HI>Baneretti, cum Vassalorum no men jam desierat, a Baronibus secundi erant; quibus in∣ditum nomen a Vexillo, Concessum illis erat Mili∣taris virtutis ergo quadrato vexillo (perinde ac Barones) uti, unde &amp;</HI> Equites Vexillarii <HI>à non∣nullis vocantur, &amp;c.</HI> Some maintain a <HI>Baneret</HI> ought not to be made in a Civil War, but I finde in Sir <HI>Rich. Bakers Chron. fol.</HI> 260. That <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh made divers <HI>Banerets</HI> upon the <HI>Cornish</HI> Commotion in the year 1495. Of creating these Knights, read <HI>Seagar-Norroy</HI> his Book, <HI>Lib. 2. cap.</HI> 10. and <HI>Seldens Titles of Honor, fol.</HI> 799. That they are next to <HI>Barons</HI> in Dignity, appears by the Statute 14 <HI>Rich. 2. c.</HI> 11. and 5 <HI>Rich. 2. Stat. 2. cap.</HI> 4. They were ancient∣ly called by Summons to the Parliament. And we finde that a <HI>Baneret,</HI> for Praying a Pardon for a Murderer contrary to the Statute, is sub∣ject to the same punishment with a Baron, 13 <HI>Rich. 2. Stat. 2. cap. 1.

<P><HI>Bargain and Sale,</HI> Is properly a Contract made of Mannors, Lands, and other things, transferring the property thereof from the <HI>Bar∣gainer</HI> to the <HI>Bargainee,</HI> which ought to be in con∣sideration of Money; it is a good Contract for Land, &amp;c. and the Fee passeth, though it be not said in the Deed <HI>(To have and to hold, to him and his heirs,)</HI> and though there be no Livery and Seisin given by the Vendor; so it be by Deed indented, sealed, and enrolled, either in the County where the Land lies, or in one of the Kings Courts of Record at <HI>West∣minster,</HI> within six moneths after the date of the Deed. 27 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 16.

<P><HI>Baron <HI>(baro)</HI></HI> Hath divers significations. First it is a degree of Nobility next a Vis∣count. <HI>Bracton (Lib. 1. cap. 8. numb.</HI> 4.) says, <HI>Sunt &amp; alii Potentes sub Rege, qui dicuntur</HI> Ba∣rones, <HI>quasi, robur belli.</HI> In which signification it agrees with other Nations, where <HI>Baroniae</HI> are as much as <HI>Provinciae.</HI> So as <HI>Barons</HI> are such as have the Government of Provinces, as their Fee holden of the King, some having greater, some lesser authority within their Territories. Yet it is probable, that of old here in <HI>England,</HI> all those were called <HI>Barons</HI> that had such Seig∣niories or Lordships, as we now call <HI>Court Barons,</HI> who are at this day called <HI>Seigneurs</HI> in <HI>France:</HI> And the Learned in our Antiquities, have informed us, That not long after the Con∣quest, all such came to the Parliament, and sate as <HI>Peers</HI> in the Lords House. But when by experience it appeared, that the Parliament was too much thronged with such multitudes, it was in the Reign of King <HI>John</HI> ordained, That none but the <HI>Barones Majores</HI> should for their extraordinary wisdom, interest, or quality, be summoned to Parliament. After that, again Men seeing this estate of Nobility to be but casual, and depend meerly upon the Princes pleasure, they sought a more certain hold, and obtained of the King Letters Patent of this Dignity, to them, and their Heirs-male; who were called <HI>Barons by Letters Patent,</HI> or by Creation, whose posterity are now by inheri∣tance, and true descent of Nobility, those <HI>Barons</HI> that are called Lords of the Parliament, of which kinde, the King may create at his plea∣sure.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there are yet <HI>Barons by Writ,</HI> as well as <HI>Barons by Letters Patent.</HI> Those <HI>Ba∣rons</HI> who were first by Writ, may now justly also be called, <HI>Barons by Prescription,</HI> for that
<PB REF="23"/>
they and their Ancestors have continued <HI>Barons,</HI> beyond the Memory of Man. The original of <HI>Barons</HI> by Writ, <HI>Camden</HI> (in his <HI>Britan. pag.</HI> 109.) refers to <HI>Henry</HI> the Third. <HI>Barons by Letters Patent,</HI> or Creation commenced 11 <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. The manner of whose Creation read in <HI>Seldens titles of Honor, fol. 687. Ferns Glory of Generosity, pag.</HI> 125, 126. To these <HI>Seager (lib. 4. cap. 13. Of Honor, Civil, and Military)</HI> adds a third kinde of Baron, calling them <HI>Barons by Tenure,</HI> which are some of our Ancient Barons, and likewise the Bishops, who, by vertue of Baronies annexed to their Bishopricks, always had place in the Lords House of Parliament, and are termed <HI>Lords Spiritual.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Baron</HI> in the next signification, is an Officer, as <HI>Barons of the Exchequer,</HI> of whom, the prin∣cipal is called <HI>Lord chief Baron (Capitalis Baro,)</HI> and the three other are his Assistants in Causes of Justice, between the King and his Subjects, touching matters appertaining to the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and the Kings Revenue. The <HI>Lord Cheif Baron,</HI> is the cheif Judge of the Court, and in Matter of Law, Information and Plea answers the Bar, and gives order for Judgment thereupon. He alone in the Term time sits upon <HI>Nisi prius,</HI> that come out of the <HI>Kings Remembrancers</HI> Office, or out of the Office of the Clerk of the Pleas, which cannot be dispatched in the mornings for want of time. He takes Recognizances for the Kings Debts, for appearances and observing orders. He takes the presentation of all the Officers in Court under himself, and of the Lord Major of <HI>London,</HI> and sees the <HI>Kings Remem∣brancer</HI> give them their Oaths. He takes the Declaration of certain Receivers accompts of the Lands of the late Augmentation made be∣fore him, by the Auditors. He gives the two <HI>Parcel-makers</HI> places by vertue of his Office.</P>
<P>The <HI>second Baron,</HI> in the absence of the Lord cheif Baron, answers the Bar and takes Re∣cognizances as aforesaid. He gives yearly the Oath to the late Major of <HI>London,</HI> for the true accompt of the profits of his Office. He takes certain Receivers accompts, and examines the Letters and Sums of such Sheriffs Forein Ac∣compts; as also the Accompts of Escheators and Collectors of Subsidies and Taxes, as are brought him by the Auditor of the Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>third Baron,</HI> in the absence of the other two, answers the Bar and takes Recognizances as aforesaid. He gives yearly the Oath to the late Major and Gawger of <HI>London</HI> for his true accompting. He also takes certain Receivers Accompts, and examines the Letters and Sums of such of the former Accomptants, as are brought unto him.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth Baron,</HI> is always a Cursitor of the Court; at the days prefixed, he takes Oath of all High Sheriffs, and their Under Sheriffs, Bailiffs, and other Accomptants, for their true accompting. He takes the Oath of all Collectors, Comptrollers, Surveyors, and Searchers of the Custom-houses, that they have made true En∣trances in their Books. He apposeth all Sheriffs upon their Summons of the Pipe in open Court; and informs the rest of the <HI>Barons</HI> of the Course of the Court, in any Matter that con∣cerns the Kings Prerogative. He likewise ex∣amines such Accompts as are brought to him.</P>
<P>These <HI>Barons of the Exchequer</HI> are ancient Officers; for I finde them named in <HI>Westm. 2. cap. 11. Anno 13 Edw.</HI> 1. and they are called <HI>Barons,</HI> because <HI>Barons</HI> of the Realm were wont to be employed in that Office. <HI>Fleta, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 24. Their Office is to look to the Ac∣compts of the Prince, and to that end, they have <HI>Auditors</HI> under them; as also to decide all Causes appertaining to the Kings Revenue, coming into the <HI>Exchequer</HI> by any means; as in part is proved by the Statutes of 20 <HI>Edw. 3. cap</HI> 2. and 27 <HI>ejusdem, Stat. 2. cap. 18. 5 Rich. 2. Stat. 1. cap.</HI> 9. and 12 &amp; 14 <HI>ejusdem, cap.</HI> 11. Whereupon they have been of late persons learned in the Laws, whereas in ancient time they were <HI>Majores &amp; Discretiores in Regno, sive de Clero essent, sive de Curia.</HI></P>
<P>There are also <HI>Barons</HI> of the Cinque Ports, <HI>Anno 31 Edw. 3.

<P><HI>Borow-holders <HI>alias</HI> Bursholders, <HI>quasi Borhoe-ealders,</HI></HI> are the same with <HI>Borowheads. Bracton</HI> calls them <HI>Borghy-Alders, Lib. 3. tract. 2. cap.</HI> 10.</P>
<P><HI>Borow-English</HI> (Sax. Borhoe Englisc) Is a customary Descent of Lands, whereby in all places, where this Custom holds, Lands and Tenements descend to the youngest Son; or, if the owner have no issue, to his youngest Brother, as in <HI>Edmunton. Kitchin, fol</HI> 102. And the reason of this Custom (according to <HI>Littleton)</HI> is, For that the youngest is presumed in Law, to be least able to shift for himself.</P>
<P><HI>Borow Goods Divisable.</HI> These words are found in the Statute of <HI>Acton Burnel, 11 Edw.</HI> 1. As, before the Statutes of 32 <HI>&amp; 34 Hen.</HI> 8. no Lands were Divisable at the Common Law, but in ancient <HI>Baronies;</HI> so perhaps, at the making the foresaid Statute of <HI>Acton-Burnel,</HI> it was doubtful, whether Goods were Divisable, but in ancient <HI>Borows.</HI> For it seems by the Writ <HI>De rationabili parte bonorum,</HI> anciently the Goods of a Man were partable between his Wife and Children.</P>

<P><HI>Boscus,</HI> Is an ancient word used in the Law of <HI>England,</HI> for all manner of Wood. The <HI>Italian</HI> useth <HI>Bosco</HI> in the same sence, and the <HI>French, Boys. Boscus</HI> is divided into High∣wood or Timber <HI>(Haut-bois)</HI> and Copice or Under-wood <HI>(Sub-Bois.)</HI> High-wood is pro∣perly called <HI>Saltus,</HI> and in <HI>Fleta, Maere∣mium.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Bottomry</HI> or <HI>Botomary <HI>(Anno 16 Car. 2. cap.</HI></HI> 6.) Is, when the Master of a Ship borrows Money upon the Kiel or Bottom of his Ship, and binds the Ship it self, That if the Money be not paid by the day assigned, the Creditor shall have the Ship. <HI>Ceo</HI> Bottomage <HI>est quand argent est borrow sur le Keil del Neif, &amp; le Neif oblige al payment de ceo.

<P>Others define it thus, When <HI>I. S.</HI> lends Money to a Merchant, that wants it to Traf∣fick, and is to be paid a greater sum at the re∣turn of the Ship, standing to the hazard of the Voyage; and though the profit be above six <HI>per cent,</HI> it is not reckoned Usury.</P>

<P><HI>Cape</HI> (Lat.) Is a Writ Judicial touching Plea of Land or Tenements; so termed (as most Writs are) of that word, which carries the especial est intention, or end of it. And this Writ is divided into <HI>Cape Magnum</HI> and <HI>Cape Parvum:</HI> Both which (as is before said in <HI>Attachment)</HI> take hold of things immoveable, and seem to differ in these points. First, Be∣cause <HI>Cape Magnum</HI> or the <HI>Grand Cape</HI> lies be∣fore appearance, and <HI>(Cape Parvum)</HI> after∣ward. Secondly, The <HI>(Cape Magnum)</HI> sum∣mons the Tenant to answer to the Default, and over to the Demandant. <HI>Cape Parvum</HI> Summons the Tenant to answer to the Default onely; and therefore is called <HI>Cape Parvum</HI> or <HI>Petit Cape. Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 161, 162. Yet <HI>Ingham</HI> saith, it is called <HI>Petit Cape,</HI> not because it is of small force, but that it consists of few words.</P>
<P><HI>Cape Magnum</HI> in the <HI>Old. Nat. Br.</HI> is thus defined; Where a Man hath brought a <HI>Praecipe quod Reddat</HI> of a thing that touches Plea of Land, and the Tenant makes default at the day to him given in the Original Writ, then this Writ shall go for the King, to take the Land into His hands; and if the Tenant come not at the day given him thereby, he loseth his Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Form of this Writ, you may see in the <HI>Reg. Judicial, fol. 1. b.</HI> Of this Writ, and the Explication of its true force and effect, read <HI>Bracton, lib 3. tract. 3. cap. 1. num. 4, 5, &amp;</HI> 6.</P>
<P><HI>Cape Parvum</HI> or <HI>Petit Cape</HI> (in <HI>Old. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 162.) Is thus defined; Where the Tenant is summoned in Plea of Land, and comes at the Summons, and his appearance is of Record; and at the day given him, prays the View, and having it granted, makes default, then shall Issue this Writ for the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The difference betwixt the <HI>Grand Cape</HI> and <HI>Petit Cape</HI> (which in effect or consequence, are alike) is, that the <HI>Grand Cape</HI> is Awarded upon the Defendant or Tenants not appearing or demanding the View in such Real Actions, where the Original Writ does not mention the parcels or particu∣lars demanded: And the <HI>Petit Cape,</HI> after Ap∣parence or View granted. Its Form see in <HI>Reg. Jud. fol.</HI> 2. and <HI>Fleta, lib. 6. cap.</HI> 44.</P>
<P><HI>Cape ad Valentiam,</HI> Is a Species of <HI>Cape Magnum,</HI> so called of the end whereto it tends, and (in <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 161.) thus described. Where I am impleaded of Lands, and I vouch to warrant another, against whom the Summons <HI>Ad Warrantizandum</HI> hath been Awarded, and the Sheriff comes not at the day given; then, if the Demandant recover against me, I shall have this Writ against the Vouchee, and shall recover so much <HI>in value</HI> of the Lands of the Vouchee, if he hath so much, if not, then I shall have execution of such Lands and Tene∣ments as descend to him in Fee; or, if he pur∣chase afterwards, I shall have against him a Re∣summons; and if he can say nothing, I shall recover the <HI>value.</HI> This Writ lies before Ap∣parence. Of these, and their divers uses, see the Table of the <HI>Reg. Judicial, verbo, Cape.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Capias,</HI> is a Writ of two sorts, one before Judgment, called <HI>Capias ad Respondendum,</HI> where the Sheriff, upon Original, or other Writ in a Personal Action returns <HI>Nihil habet in Baliva nostra.</HI> The other is a Writ of Executi∣on after Judgment, being also of divers kindes; as <HI>Capias ad Satisfaciendum, Capias pro Fine, Capias Utlagatum,</HI> after Judgment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Capias ad Satisfaciendum,</HI> Is a Writ of Execution after Judgment, lying where a Man recovers in an Action Personal; as for Debt, Damages, Detinue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Kings Court: In which case, this Writ Issues to the Sheriff, commanding him to take the body of him, against whom the Debt is recovered, who shall be put in prison, till he make satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB REF="30"/>
<HI>Capias pro Fine,</HI> Is where one, being by Judgment fined to the King, upon some offence committed against a Statute, does not discharge it, according to the Judgment: By this there∣fore is his body to be taken and committed to prison, until he pay the Fine. <HI>Coke, lib. 3. fol.</HI> 12. Or where, upon a <HI>Non est factum</HI> pleaded, his Plea is, by evidence or his own after-ac∣knowledgment, not made out or verified, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Capias Utlagatum,</HI> Is a Writ which lies against him, who is outlawed upon any Action Personal or Criminal, by which the Sheriff apprehends the party outlawed, for not appear∣ing upon the <HI>Exigend,</HI> and keeps him in safe custody till the day of return, and then pre∣sents him to the Court, there farther to be or∣dered for his contempt; which (if in the Com∣mon Pleas) was in former times to be commit∣ted to the Fleet, there to remain till he had sued out the Kings Charter of Pardon, and appeared to the Action. At present, in the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> the <HI>Outlary</HI> cannot be reversed, unless the Defendant appear in person, and by a present of Gloves to the Judges, implore and obtain their savor to reverse it. And in the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> the Defendant (not being an Executor or Administrator) is now to give good Bail (which he is allow'd to do by Atturny) to answer the Action, if the Debt or Damage demanded be 20 l. or above, and to pay the Plaintiffs charges, before the <HI>outlary</HI> be re∣versed. And, by a special <HI>Capias Utlagatum</HI> in the same Writ, the Sheriff is commanded, and may seize all the Defendants Lands, Goods, and Chattels for the contempt to the King; and the Plaintiff may (after an Inquisition taken thereupon, and returned into the <HI>Exchequer)</HI> obtain a Lease of the Lands extended, and a grant of the Goods, whereby to compel the Defendant to appear; which, when he shall do and reverse the Utlary, are to be restored to him.

<P><HI>Capias conductos ad proficiscendum,</HI> Is an Original Writ, which lies, by the Common Law, against any Soldier that hath covenanted to serve the King in his War, and appears not at the time and place appointed, directed to two of the Kings Serjeants at Arms to arrest, and take him wheresoever he may be found, and to bring him <HI>Coram Consilio nostro;</HI> with a Clause of Assistance, 4 <HI>Inst. fol.</HI> 128.</P>

The ground of this <HI>Challenge,</HI> you may see in <HI>Fleta, lib. 4. cap. 8.

<P><HI>Champarti</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Champ,</HI> a Field and <HI>Parli,</HI> divided; because the Field or Land in question, is commonly divided between the <HI>Champartor,</HI> who maintains the sute, and the person in whose name and right he sues) Sig∣nifies a Maintenance of any Man in his sute, upon condition to have part of the thing (be it Land or Goods) when it is recovered. This seems to have been an ancient grievance in our Nation; for nowithstanding the several Sta∣tutes of 3 <HI>Edw. 1. cap. 25.—13 Edw. 1. c. 49.—28 Edw. 1. c. 11. 33 Edw. 1.

<P>This Office (ever since the Coronation of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, when <HI>Baldwin Fre∣vile</HI> exhibited his Petition for it) was adjudged from him to Sir <HI>John Dymock,</HI> his Competitor (both claiming from <HI>Marmion)</HI> as producing better Records and Evidence; and hath con∣tinued ever since in the worthy family of <HI>Dy∣mock,</HI> who hold the Mannor of <HI>Scrivelsby</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> hereditarily from the <HI>Marmions,</HI> by Grand Sergeanty, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Lord thereof shall be the Kings <HI>Champion,</HI> as above∣said. <HI>Camd. in part.

<P><HI>Chancellor <HI>(Cancellarius)</HI></HI> This Officer in late times is greatly advanced, not onely in our, but in other Kingdoms: For he is the chief Administrator of Justice, next to the Soveraign. All other Justices in this Kingdom are tied to the Law, and may not swerve from it in Judgment; but the <HI>Chancellor</HI> hath the Kings absolute power to moderate the Written Law, governing his Judgment by the Law of Nature and Conscience, and ordering all things <HI>juxta aequum &amp; bonum.</HI> Wherefore <HI>Stanford</HI> (in his <HI>Praerog. cap. 20. fol.</HI> 65.) says, The <HI>Chan∣cellor</HI> hath two powers, one absolute, the other ordinary; meaning, that, though by his ordi∣nary power in some cases, he must observe the form of proceeding, as other Inferior Judges, yet in his absolute power, he is not limitted by the Written Law, but by Conscience and E∣quity, according the Circumstances of Matter. And though <HI>Polydor Virgil,</HI> an alien, under∣taking to write the History of <HI>England,</HI> sup∣posed he did not mistake, when he makes our <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, the Founder of our <HI>Chancellors;</HI> yet our industrious Antiquary Mr. <HI>Dugdale</HI> can shew us his Error in the many <HI>Chancellors</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> long before that time, which are mentioned in his <HI>Origines Juridiciales,</HI> and Catalogue of <HI>Chancellors,</HI> whose great Authorities under their Kings, were in all probability drawn from the reasonable Cu∣stoms of Neighbor Nations, and the Civil Law.</P>
<P>He that bears this Magistracy, is called <HI>The Lord Chancellor of England,</HI> and is made so <HI>Per traditionem magni Sigilli sibi per Dominum Regem,</HI> and by taking his Oath. And by the Statute 5 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 18. the <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> and <HI>Keeper,</HI> have one and the same Power; and therefore since that Statute, there cannot be a <HI>Lord Chancellor,</HI> and <HI>Lord Keeper,</HI> at one and the same time, but before there might, and hath been. Yet see <HI>Keeper</HI> See <HI>Fleta, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 12, 13. and <HI>Cokes 4 Instit. fol.</HI> 78, 79. Di∣vers Inferior Officers are also called <HI>Chancellors,</HI> As</P>
<P><HI>Chancellor of the Exchequer (Anno 25 Hen 8. cap.</HI> 16.) Whose Office hath been thought by many to have been created for the qualifying extremities in the <HI>Exchequer:</HI> He sits in the Court, and in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Chamber, and with the rest of the Court, orders things to the Kings best benefit. He is always in Com∣mission with the Lord Treasurer, for letting the Lands that came to the Crown by the disso∣lution of Abbeys, or otherwise; and hath by the Statute of 33 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 39. power with others, to compound for the Forfeitures upon Penal Statutes, Bonds, and Recognizances, entred unto the King: He hath also a great Authority and Jurisdiction in the manage and dispose of the Royal Revenue, and concerning the First Fruits, as appears by the Acts for uniting them to the Crown.</P>
<P><HI>Chancellor of the Dutchy of Lancaster, (Anno 3 Edw. 6. cap.</HI> 1. and <HI>Anno 5 Ejusdem, cap.</HI> 26.)

<P><HI>Chance medley</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Chance, i. Lapsus</HI> and <HI>Mesler, i. Miscere)</HI> Signifies the casual slaughter of a Man, not altogether with∣out the fault of the slayer. <HI>Stanf. Pl. Cor. lib. 1 cap.</HI> 8. calls it homicide by misadventure. <HI>West</HI> calls it Homicide mixt <HI>(Part. 2. Symbol. tit. Indictments, Sect.</HI> 5.) and there defines it thus; <HI>Homicide mixt</HI> is, when the Killers ignorance or negligence is joyned with the <HI>Chance;</HI> As if a Man lop Trees by a Highway side, by which many usually travel, and cast down a bough, not giving warning to beware of it, by which bough one passing by, is by <HI>chance</HI> slain. In this case he offends, because he gave no warn∣ing, that the party nigh have taken better heed. See <HI>Skene, verbo, Melletum,</HI> who says this is called <HI>Chaudmelle</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Chapel <HI>(Capella)</HI></HI> Fr. <HI>Chapelle, i. aedicula)</HI> Is of two sorts, either adjoyning to a Church, as parcel of it, which persons of quality build, <HI>Ut ibidem familiaria Sepulchra sibi con∣stituant;</HI> or else separate from the Mother Church, where the Parish is wide, and is com∣monly called a <HI>Chappel of Ease;</HI> because it is built for the ease of one or more Parishioners that dwell far from the Church, and is served by some Inferior Curate, provided at the charge of the Rector, or of him that hath benefit by it, as the Composition or Custom is.</P>
<P>There is also a <HI>Free Chappel,</HI> which seems to be such as hath perpetual maintenance towards the upholding it, and the Curates stipend, by some Lands or Rents charitably bestowed on it, without the charge of the Rector or Parish. <HI>Anno 37 Hen. 8. cap. 4.

<P><HI>Chapiters</HI> (Lat. <HI>Capitula,</HI> Fr. <HI>Chapiters, i.</HI> The Chapters of a Book) Signifies a Sum∣mary or Content of such Matters as are to be enquired of, or presented before Justices in Eyr, Justices of Assize, or of Peace in their Sessions. This it is used <HI>Anno 3 Edw. 1. cap.</HI> 27.—<HI>And that no Clerk of any Justice, Escheator, or Commissioner in Eyr, shall take any thing for delivering</HI> Chapters, <HI>but onely Clerks of Justices in their Circuits.</HI> And again, <HI>Anno 13 Ejusdem, cap.</HI> 10.—<HI>The Sheriff shall certifie the</HI> Chapiters <HI>before the Justices in Eyr, how many Writs he hath, and what. &amp;c. <HI>Britton (cap.</HI></HI> 3.) useth the word in the same signification. <HI>Chapiters</HI> are now most usually called <HI>Articles,</HI> and are delivered by the Mouth of the Justice in his <HI>Charge,</HI> to the Enquest; whereas in ancient time (as appears by <HI>Bracton</HI> and <HI>Britton)</HI> they were (after an Exhortation given by the Justi∣ces for the good observation of the Laws, and Kings peace) first read distinctly in open Court, and then delivered in writing to the Grand Enquest, which the Grand Jury or Enquest were likewise to answer upon their Oaths, Af∣firmatively or Negatively, and, not as they do now, put the Judges to make long and learned <HI>Charges</HI> to little, or no purpose, and forswear∣ing or wilfully not remembring their Know∣ledge of Transgressors, against the Design and Enquiry of those <HI>Articles,</HI> do think their Oaths and Duty to God and the King, and their Countrey, well enough satisfied and performed, if they onely present those few, of many more, Misdemeanors, which are brought unto them by way of Indictments. The same <HI>Order of Articles, Lambert</HI> wishes might still be obser∣ved. <HI>Eiren. lib. 4. cap. 4. pag. 393.

<P><HI>Charter-party</HI> (Lat. <HI>Charta partita,</HI> Fr. <HI>Chartre-parti, i.</HI> A Deed or Writing divided) Is that among Merchants and Sea-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring men, which we commonly call a Pair of Indentures, containing the Covenants and Agreements made between them, touching their Merchandise and Maritime Affairs. <HI>Anno 32 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 14. and 12 <HI>Car. 2. cap. 18.

<P><HI>Chase,</HI> (Fr. <HI>Chasse)</HI> Signifies two things: First, a driving Cattle to, or from any place; as to <HI>chase</HI> a Distress to a Fortlet. <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 45. Secondly, it is a place of Receipt for Deer, and Wilde Beasts, of a middle nature between a Forest and a Park, being commonly less then a Forest, and not endued with so many Liberties, as the Courts of <HI>Attachment, Swain-mote,</HI> and <HI>Justice-seat;</HI> and yet of a larger compass, and stored with greater diver∣sity, both of Keepers and Wilde Beasts, or Game, then a Park. <HI>Crompton</HI> in his <HI>Jurisd. fol.</HI> 148. says, A <HI>Forest</HI> cannot be in the hands of a Subject, but it forthwith loseth its name, and becomes a <HI>Chase;</HI> and yet <HI>fol.</HI> 197. he says, A Subject may be Lord and owner of a Forest, which though it seems a contradiction, yet both sayings are in some sort true. For the King may give or alienate a Forest to a Subject, yet so, as, when it is once in the Subject, it loseth the true property of a Forest; because the Courts called the <HI>Justice-seat, Swain-mote,</HI> and <HI>Attachment,</HI> do forthwith vanish; none being able to make a Lord Chief Justice in <HI>Fyr</HI> of the Forest, but the King; as <HI>Manwood</HI> well observes <HI>Par. 2. cap. 3. &amp;</HI> 4. Yet it may be grant∣ed in so large a manner, as there may be <HI>At∣tachment, Swain-mote,</HI> and a Court equivalent to a Justice Seat, as appears by him in the same Chapter, <HI>num.</HI> 3. So that a <HI>Chase</HI> differs from a Forest in this, because it may be in the hands of a Subject, which a Forest, in his proper and true nature, cannot; and from a Park, in that it is not enclosed, and hath not onely a larger compass, and more variety of Game; but of Keepers also, and Officers. See <HI>For∣est.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chattels</HI> or <HI>Catals <HI>(Catallia alias Capi∣talia)</HI></HI> Comprehend all Goods moveable and immoveable, except such as are in nature of Freehold, or parcel of it, as may be collected out of <HI>Stamf. Praerog. cap.</HI> 16. and <HI>Anno 1 E∣liz. cap.</HI> 2. Yet <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 32. says, That Money is not to be accounted Goods or <HI>Chat∣tels,</HI> because it is not of it self valuable; nor Hawks and Hounds, for they are <HI>Ferae naturae. Chattels</HI> are either <HI>personal</HI> or <HI>real. Personal,</HI> may be so called in two respects: One, because they belong immediately to the person of a

Man, as a Bow, Horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The other, for that being any way injuriously withheld from us, we have no means to recover them, but Personal Actions. <HI>Chattels real,</HI> are such as either appertain not immediately to the person, but to some other thing, by way of dependency, as a Box with Charters of Land, Apples upon a Tree, or a Tree it self growing on the Ground. <HI>Cromp.

<P><HI>Colour <HI>(color)</HI></HI> Signifies a probable Plea, but in truth, false, and hath this end, to draw the tryal of the Cause from the Jury to the Judges.

<P><HI>Commandry <HI>(Praeceptoria)</HI></HI> Was a Mannor or cheif Messuage, with Lands and Tenements appertaining thereto, belonging to the Priory of St. <HI>Johns</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and he, who had the Goverment of any such Mannor or House, was called the <HI>Commander;</HI> who could not dispose of it, but to the use of the Priory, onely taking thence his own sustenance, accord∣ing to his degree, who was usually a Brother of the same Priory. <HI>New Eagle</HI> in the County of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> was, and still is called the <HI>Commandry of Eagle,</HI> and did anciently belong to the said Priory; so were <HI>Slebach</HI> in <HI>Pembrokeshire,</HI> and <HI>Shengay</HI> in <HI>Cambridgeshire Commandries,</HI> in time of the Knights-Templers, says <HI>Camd.</HI>—These, in many places of <HI>England,</HI> are termed Temples, as <HI>Temple Bruere</HI> in <HI>Lincoln∣shire, Temple Newsum</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire, &amp;c.</HI> because they formerly belonged to the said <HI>Templers.</HI> Of these read <HI>Anno 26 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 2. and 32 <HI>Ejusdem, cap.</HI> 24.

<P><HI>Commandment <HI>(Praeceptum)</HI></HI> Hath a di∣vers use; as the <HI>Commandment</HI> of the King, when, upon his meer motion and from his own mouth, he casts any Man into Prison. <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. fol. 72. Commandment</HI> of the Justices is either <HI>absolute</HI> or <HI>ordinary. Absolute,</HI> as when, upon their own Authority in their Wis∣dom and Discretion, they commit a Man to prison for a punishment. <HI>Ordinary</HI> is, when they commit one rather for safe-custody, then punishment. A Man committed upon an <HI>Ordi∣nary Commandment</HI> is replevisable. <HI>Pl. Cor. fol. 73. Commandment</HI> is again used for the offence of him, that willeth another Man to transgress the Law, or to do any thing contrary to the Law; as Murther, Theft, or such like. <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. tract. 2. cap.</HI> 19. which the <HI>Civilians</HI> call <HI>Mandatum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Commendam <HI>(Ecclesia Commendata)</HI></HI> Is a Benefice or Church-Living, which being void, is <HI>commended</HI> to the charge and care of some sufficient Clerk, to be supplied, until it may be conveniently provided of a Pastor. And, that this was the true original of this practise, you may read at large in <HI>Durandus, De sacris Ecclesiae Ministeriis &amp; Beneficiis, lib. 5. cap.</HI> 7. He to whom the Church is <HI>commended,</HI> hath the Fruits and Profits thereof, onely for a certain

time; and the Nature of the Church is not changed thereby, but is as a thing deposited in his hands in trust, who hath nothing but the custody of it, which may be revoked. When a Parson is made Bishop, there is a <HI>Cession</HI> of his Benefice by the Promotion; but if the King gives him power to retain his Benefice, he shall continue Parson, and is said to hold it in <HI>Com∣mendam.

<P><HI>Commissary <HI>(Commissarius)</HI></HI> Is a Title of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, appertaining to such a one, as exerciseth Spiritual Jurisdiction in places of the Diocess so far distant from the cheif City, as the <HI>Chancellor</HI> cannot call the Subjects to the Bishops Principal Consistory, without their too great molestation. This <HI>Commissary</HI> is by the Canonists called <HI>Commissa∣rius</HI> or <HI>Officialis foraneus. Lyndwoods Provin. cap.</HI> 1. And is ordained to this special end, that he supply the Bishops Jurisdiction and Office in the out places of the Diocess, or else in such Parishes as are peculiar to the Bishop, and exempted from the Jurisdiction of the Arch-deacon. For where either by Prescrip∣tion or Composition, Arch-deacons have Juris∣diction within their Arch-deaconries, as in most places they have, this <HI>Commissary</HI> is but superfluous, and oft-times vexations to the peo∣ple. Therefore the Bishop, taking Prestation Money of his Arch-Deacons yearly, <HI>Pro exte∣riori Jurisdictione,</HI> as it is ordinarily called, does by super-onerating their circuit with a <HI>Commissary,</HI> not onely wrong Arch-deacons, but the poorer sort of Subjects much more. <HI>Cowel.</HI> and see 4 <HI>Inst. fol.</HI> 338.</P>
<P><HI>Commission <HI>(Commissio)</HI></HI> Is with us, as much as <HI>delegatio</HI> with the <HI>Civilians,</HI> and is taken for the Warrant or Letters Patent, which all Men (exercising Jurisdiction, either ordinary or extraordinary) have to authorise them to hear or determine any cause or action. Of these see divers in the Table of the <HI>Reg. of Writs,</HI> and see <HI>Broke, tit. Commission;</HI> yet this word is sometimes extended farther then to Matters of Judgment, as the <HI>Commission</HI> of Purveyors or Takers, <HI>Anno 11 Hen. 4. cap.</HI> 28. which seems to be null by the Statute, for taking away Pur∣veyance. <HI>Anno 12 Car. 2. cap.</HI> 24. The High Commission Court which was founded upon the Statute 1 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 1. is also abolished by Act of Parliament, 17 <HI>Car. 1. cap.</HI> 11. and that again explained by another Act, 13 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 12.</P>
<P><HI>Commission of Association</HI> (mentioned 18 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 9.) Is a Commission under the Great Seal, to associate two or more learned persons, with the several Justices in the several Circuits and Counties in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Commission of Anticipation,</HI> Was a <HI>Commission</HI> under the Great Seal, to collect a Subsidy before the day. <HI>Anno 15 Hen 8. Cokes 12 Rep. fol.</HI> 120.</P>
<P><HI>Comission of Rebellion <HI>(Commissio Rebel∣lionis)</HI></HI> Is otherwise called a <HI>Writ of Rebellion,</HI> and Issues, when a Man (after Proclamation issued out of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> and made by the Sheriff, to present himself, under pain of his allegiance to the Court, by a certain day) ap∣pears not. And this <HI>Commission</HI> is directed by way of command to certain persons, three, two or one of them, to apprehend or cause to be apprehended, the party, as a <HI>Rebel,</HI> or con∣temner of the Kings Laws; wheresoever they finde him within the Kingdom, and bring or cause him to be brought to the Court upon a day therein assigned: The Form of it you have in <HI>West, Tract.</HI> Touching proceedings in <HI>Chancery, Sect.</HI> 24.</P>
<P><HI>Commissioner <HI>(Commissionarius)</HI></HI> Is he that hath Commission, as Letters Patent, or other lawful Warrant, to execute any Publick Of∣fice; as Commissioners of the Office of Li∣cences of Alienation. <HI>West.

<P><HI>Committée.</HI> Is he, or they to whom the consideration or ordering of any matter is re∣ferred, either by some Court or Consent of Parties to whom it belongs. As in Parliament, a Bill being read, is either consented to and passed, or denied, or neither, but referred to the consideration of some certain persons, appoint∣ed by the House farther to examine it, who thereupon are called a <HI>Committee. Committee</HI> of the King. <HI>West. pa. 2. Symb. tit. Chancery, Sect.</HI> 144. This word seems to be strangely used in <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 160. where the Widdow of the Kings Tenant being dead, is called the <HI>Commit∣tee of the King,</HI> that is, one committed by the ancient Law of the Land, to the Kings care and protection.</P>

<P><HI>Common <HI>(Commune, i. quod ad omnes per∣tinet)</HI></HI> Signifies that Soil or Water, whereof the use is common to this or that Town or Lordship; as <HI>Common of Pasture, (Commune Pasturae.) Bracton, lib. 4. cap. 19. &amp; 40. Commun of Fishing, (Commune Piscariae.) Idem, lib. 2. cap. 34. Common of Turbary, (Commune Tur∣bariae, i.</HI> Of digging Turves.) <HI>Idem, lib. 4. cap. 41.

Common</HI> is divided into <HI>Common in Gross, Common Appendant, Common Apportenant,</HI> and <HI>Common per cause de Vicinage, i.</HI> By reason of Neighborhood.</P>
<P><HI>Common in Gross,</HI> Is a liberty to have <HI>Com∣mon</HI> alone (that is) without any Land or Te∣ment, in another Mans Land, to himself for life, or to him, and his heirs; and it is com∣monly passed by Deed of Grant or Specialty. <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol. 31. &amp;</HI> 37.</P>
<P><PB REF="39"/>
<HI>Common Appendant,</HI> and <HI>Common Appur∣tenant,</HI> are in a manner confounded, as ap∣pears by <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 180. And are de∣fined to be a Liberty of <HI>Common Appurtaining</HI> to, or <HI>Depending</HI> on such, or such a Freehold; which <HI>Common</HI> must be taken with Beasts Commonable; as Horses, Oxen, Kine, and Sheep, being accounted fittest for the Plough∣man; and not of Goats, Geese, and Hogs: But some make this difference, That <HI>Common Appurtenant</HI> may be severed from the Land whereto it pertains, but not <HI>Common Appen∣dant;</HI> which (according to Sir <HI>Edw. Coke, lib. 4. fol.</HI> 37.) had this beginning—When a Lord enfeoffed another in Arabic Lands, to hold of him in <HI>Soccage;</HI> the Feoffce, to main∣tain the service of his Plough, had at first, by the Curtesie or Permission of the Lord, <HI>Com∣mon</HI> in the Wastes of his Lord, for his neces∣sary Beasts, to ear and compost his Land, and that for two Causes; one, for that, as then it was taken, it was tacitly implied in the Feoff∣ment, by reason the Feoffee could not Till, nor Compost his Land without Cattle, and Cattle could not be sustained without Pasture, and so by consequence the Feoffee had, as a thing necessary and incident, <HI>Common</HI> in the Wastes and Land of the Lord. And this appears by the ancient Books, <HI>Temp. Ed. 1. tit. Common</HI> 24. and 17 <HI>Edw. 2. tit. Common</HI> 23. and 20 <HI>Edw. 3. tit. Admeasurement</HI> 8. and by the rehearsal of the Statute of <HI>Merton, cap.</HI> 4. The second rea∣son was, for maintenance and advancement of Tillage, which is much regarded and favored by the Law.</P>
<P><HI>Common per cause de Vicinage (i. Common</HI> by reason of Neighborhood) Is a Liberty that the Tenants of one Lord in one Town, have to <HI>Common</HI> with the Tenants of another Lord in another Town: Those that challenge this kinde of <HI>Common</HI> (which is usually called <HI>Intercommoning)</HI> may not put their Cattel into the <HI>Common</HI> of the other Town; for then they are distrainable, but, turning them into their own Field, if they stray into the Neighbor-<HI>Common,</HI> they must be suffered; provided they do not surcharge either <HI>Common. Common of Pasture,</HI> the <HI>Civilians</HI> call <HI>Jus compascendi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Common Bench <HI>(Bancus Communis,</HI></HI> from the Sax. banc, <HI>i.</HI> A Bank, or Hillock, and metaphorically a Bench, High Seat or Tribu∣nal.) The Court of <HI>Common Pleas</HI> was ancient∣ly so called. <HI>Anno 2 Edw. 3. cap.</HI> 11. because (saith <HI>Camden</HI> in his <HI>Britan, pag.</HI> 113.)

<P><HI>Common Fine <HI>(Finis Communis)</HI></HI> Is a certain sum of Money, which the Resiants within the view of some Leets, pay to the Lord thereof, called in divers places <HI>Head-silver,</HI> in others <HI>Cert-money,</HI> or <HI>Certum Leta,</HI> and <HI>Head-pence;</HI> and was first granted to the Lord towards the charge of his purchase of the Court Leet, whereby the Resiants had now the ease, to do their Suit-Royal neerer home, and not be compelled to go to the <HI>Sheriffs Turn.</HI> As in the Mannor of <HI>Sheapshead</HI> in <HI>Com.

<P><HI>Common Pleas <HI>(Communia Placita)</HI></HI> Is the Kings Court, now constantly held in <HI>West∣minster Hall,</HI> but in ancient time moveable, as appears by <HI>Magna Charta, cap. 11. 2 Edw. 3. cap.</HI> 11. and <HI>Pupilla oculi, Parte 5. cap.</HI> 22. But <HI>Gwin,</HI> in the Preface to his <HI>Readings,</HI> saith, That until <HI>Henry</HI> the Third granted the Great Charter, there were but two Courts in all, cal∣led the <HI>Kings Courts, viz.</HI> The <HI>Exchequer</HI> and the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> which was then called <HI>Curia Domini Regis,</HI> and <HI>Aula Regis;</HI> because it fol∣lowed the Court or King, and that upon the Grant of that Charter, the Court of <HI>Common Pleas</HI> was erected and setled in one place cer∣tain, <HI>viz. Westminster Hall;</HI> amd therefore after that, all the Writs ran, <HI>Quod sit coram Justi∣ciariis meis apud Westm.</HI> whereas before the party was commanded by them to appear, <HI>Coram me vel Justiciariis meis,</HI> simply without addition of place, as he well observes out of <HI>Glanvile</HI> and <HI>Bracton,</HI> the one writing in <HI>Henry</HI> the Second's time, before this Court was erected; the other in the later end of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third's time, who erected this Court. All Civil Causes, both Real and Personal, are or were in former times tryed in this Court, according to the strict Law of the Realm; and by <HI>Fortescu, cap.</HI> 50. it seems to have been the onely Court for Real Causes. The Cheif Justice thereof, is called the <HI>Lord Cheif Justice of the Common Pleas,</HI> accompanied with three or four Judges, Assist∣ants, or Associats, who are created by Let∣ters Patent, and, as it were, enstalled or placed on the <HI>Common Bench,</HI> by the Lord Chancellor, and Lord Chief Justice of the Court, as appears by <HI>Fortescu, cap.</HI> 51. who expresseth all the circumstances thereof.

<P><HI>Common Intendment,</HI> Is Common Un∣derstanding or Meaning, according to the Sub∣ject Matter, not strained to an exotick sense. <HI>Bar to Common Intendment,</HI> is an Ordinary or General Bar, which commonly disables the Declaration of the Plaintiff.

<P><HI>Common Law <HI>(Communis Lex)</HI></HI> Hath three significations: First, It is taken for the Laws of this Realm simply, without any other Law joyned to it; As, when it is disputed, what ought of right to be determined by the <HI>Common Law,</HI> and what by the Spiritual Law, or Ad∣mirals Court, or the like. Secondly, For the <HI>Kings Court,</HI> as the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> or <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> onely to shew a difference between them and the Base Courts, as Customary Courts, Court Barons, County Courts, Pipowders, and such like: As when a Plea of Land is re∣moved out of Ancient Demesn, because the Land is Frank-fee, and pleadable at the <HI>Common Law,</HI> that is, in the Kings Court, and not in Ancient Demesn, or any other Base Court. Thirdly, and most usually, by the <HI>Common Law,</HI> is understood such Laws as were generally taken and holden for Law, before any Statute was made to alter the same. As, neither Tenant for Life, nor for Years, were punishable by the <HI>Common Law</HI> for doing <HI>Waste,</HI> till the Statute of <HI>Glouc. cap.</HI> 5. was made, which gives an Action of <HI>Waste</HI> against them.

To have and to hold the Land in <HI>S.</HI> for three years from henceforth, and the Indentures are delivered the Fourth day of <HI>June</HI> following: In this Case, <HI>from henceforth</HI> shall be accounted from the day of the Delivery, and not from the date; and if the Indenture be delivered at four of the Clock in the Afternoon of the said Fourth day of <HI>June,</HI> the Lease shall end the Third day of <HI>June,</HI> in the Third year. For the Law, in this <HI>Computation,</HI> rejects all fractions or divisions of the day, for the incertainty, which always is the Mother of Contention. So where the Sta∣tute of Enrolments, made 27 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 16. is, That Writings shall be enrolled within six Moneths after the date thereof, if such Wri∣tings have date, the Six Moneths shall be ac∣counted from the date, and not from the De∣livery; but if they want date, then it shall be accounted from the Delivery. <HI>Coke, lib. 5. fol.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>If any Deed be shewed to a Court at <HI>West∣minster,</HI> it shall remain in Court (by Judgment of the Law,) all the Term, in which it is shewed, for all the Term in Law, is but as one day. <HI>Coke, lib. 5. fol.</HI> 74. If a Church be void, and the Patron does not present within Six Moneths,

<P><HI>Concord <HI>(Concordia,</HI></HI> Agreement) Is, by a peculiar signification, defined to be the very Agreement between Parties, who intend the levying a Fine of Lands one to the other, how, and in what manner the Land shall pass.

<P><HI>Concord</HI> is also an Agreement made (upon any Trespass committed) betwixt two or more; and is divided into a <HI>Concord Executory,</HI> and a <HI>Concord Executed.</HI> See <HI>Plowden,</HI> in <HI>Reniger</HI> and <HI>Fogassa's</HI> Case, <HI>fol. 5, 6, &amp;</HI> 8. where it ap∣pears by some opinion, That the one bindes not, as being imperfect; the other absolute, and ties the party: Yet by some other opinion in the same Case, it is affirmed, That Agree∣ments Executory, are perfect, and binde no less then Agreements executed.</P>
<P><HI>Concubinage</HI> (Fr.) Signifies properly the keeping a Whore for ones own filthy use; but it is used as an exception against her, who sues for Dower, alleaging thereby that she was not Wife lawfully married to the party, in whose Lands she seeks to be endowed, but his <HI>Concubine. Britton, cap. 107. Bracton, lib. 4. tract. 6. cap.</HI> 8.</P>
<P><HI>Conders</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Conduire, i.</HI> to con∣duct) Are such as stand upon high places, near the Sea-coast, at the time of Herring-Fishing, to make signs with Boughs, &amp;c. to the Fishers, which way the shole of Herrings passeth, which may better appear to such as stand upon some high Cliff on the shore, by a kinde of blew colour they cause in the Water, then to those that are in the Ships. These are otherwise cal∣led <HI>Huers,</HI> (of the Fr. <HI>Huyer,</HI> i. <HI>Exclamare)</HI> and <HI>Balkers, Directors,</HI> and <HI>Guiders,</HI> as appears by the Statute 1 <HI>Jac. cap.</HI> 23.</P>
<P><HI>Condition <HI>(Conditio)</HI></HI> Is a Manner, Law, Quality, or Restriction annexed to Mens Acts, qualifying or suspending the same, and making them uncertain, whether they shall take effect, or no. <HI>West, pa. 1. Symb. lib. 2. sect.</HI> 156. In a Lease there may be two sorts of <HI>Conditions; Condition collateral,</HI> or <HI>Condition annexed to the Rent. Coke, lib. 3. Penants Case, fol. 64. Col∣lateral Condition,</HI> is that which is annexed to any Collateral Act, as, that the Lessee shall not go to <HI>Paris. Ibidem, fol. 65. Condition</HI> is al∣so divided into <HI>Condition in Deed or Fact,</HI> and <HI>Condition in Law;</HI> which otherwise may be termed Condition expressed, and Condition implied. <HI>Perkins, tit.

<P><HI>Condition in Deed,</HI> Is that which is knit and annexed by express words to the Feoffment, Lease, or Grant, either in writing, or without writing: As if I enfeoff a Man in Lands, re∣serving a Rent to be paid at such a Feast, upon Condition, if the Feoffee fail of payment at the day, then it shall be lawful for me to re∣enter.</P>
<P><HI>Condition Implied,</HI> which is called a <HI>Condi∣tion in Law,</HI> Is when a Man Grants to another the Office of Keeper of a Park, Steward, Bai∣liff, or the like for Life, though there be no <HI>Condition</HI> at all expressed in the Grant; yet the Law makes one covertly, which is, if the Grantee does not justly execute all things per∣taining to his Office by himself, or his sufficient Deputy, it shall be lawful for the Grantor, to enter and discharge him of his Office.

<P><HI>Confederacy <HI>(Confederatio)</HI></HI> Is when two or more confederate or combine themselves to do any damage to another, or to commit any unlawful act. And though a Writ of Conspi∣racy does not lie, if the party be not indited, and in lawful manner acquitted, for so are the words of the Writ; yet false confederacy be∣tween divers persons shall be punished, though nothing be put in execution, which appears by the Book of 27 <HI>Assis. Placit.</HI> 44. where two w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e indited of <HI>Confederacy,</HI> each to maintain
<PB REF="40"/>
other, whether their matter were true or false, and though nothing were supposed to be put in practise, the Parties were enjoyn'd to an∣swer, since the thing is forbidden by Law. So in the next <HI>Article,</HI> in the same Book, enquiry shall be made of <HI>Conspirators</HI> and <HI>Confederators,</HI> which binde themselves together, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This <HI>Confederacy,</HI> punishable by Law before it be executed, ought to have four incidents. First, It must be declared by some matter of prose∣cution, as by making of Bonds or Promises the one to the other: 2. <HI>Malicious,</HI> as for un∣just revenge. 3. It ought to be <HI>false,</HI> against an innocent. Lastly, to be out of Court, voluntary. <HI>Terms de la Ley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Confirmation <HI>(Confirmatio)</HI></HI> Is a strength∣ning or confirming an estate to one, who hath the possession, by a voidable Title, though not at present void. As, a Bishop grants his Chancellorship by Patent for term of the Pa∣tentees life: This is no void grant, but void∣able by the Bishops death, except it be strength∣ned by the Dean and Chapters Confirmation. See more of this in <HI>West, pa. 1. Symb. lib. 2. sect. 500. Fitz. Nat. Br. fol. 169. b.</HI> and <HI>Littleton, lib. 3. cap.</HI> 9.</P>
<P><HI>Confiscate,</HI> From the Lat. <HI>Confiscare,</HI> and that from <HI>Fiscus,</HI> which originally signifies a Hamper, Pannier or Basket; but Metonymi∣cally the Emperors Treasure, which was an∣ciently kept in such Hampers; and though our King keeps not His Treasure in such things, yet (as the <HI>Romans</HI> said) such Goods as were for∣feited to the Emperors Treasury for any offence, were <HI>Bona confiscata,</HI> so say we of those that are forfeited to our Kings <HI>Exchequer.</HI> And the title to have these Goods, is given the King by the Law, when they are not claimed by some other. As, if a Man be indited for feloniously stealing the Goods of another, where in truth they are the proper Goods of him indited, and they are brought in Court against him; who, being asked what he saith to the said Goods, disclaims them. By this Disclaimer he shall lose the Goods, though he be afterwards ac∣quitted of the Felony, and the King shall have them as <HI>Confiscate;</HI> but otherwise, if he had not disclaimed them. So where Goods are found in the Felons possession, which he dis∣avows, and afterwards is attainted of other Goods, and not of them, there the Goods which he disavows, are <HI>Confiscate</HI> to the King; but had he been attainted of the same Goods, they should have been said forfeited, not <HI>Con∣fiscate,</HI> notwithstanding his disavowment. See more in <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 24.

<P><HI>Conge d'Eslire</HI> (Fr. <HI>i.</HI> Leave to chuse) Signifies the Kings Permission Royal to a Dean and Chapter, in time of Vacation, to chuse a Bishop, or to an Abbey or Priory of his own Foundation, to chuse their Abbot or Prior. <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol. 169, 170.—Gwin,</HI> in the Preface to his <HI>Readings,</HI> says, The King of <HI>England,</HI> as Soveraign Patron of all Arch-Bishopricks, Bishopricks, and other Eccsesiasti∣cal Benefices, had of ancient time free appoint∣ment of all Ecclesiastical Dignities, whensoever they chanced to be void, investing them first <HI>per baculum &amp; annulum;</HI> and afterwards by His Letters Patent, and that in process of time he made the Election over to others, under certain Forms and Conditions; as namely, that they should, at every vacation, before they chuse, demand of the King <HI>Conge d'Eslire,</HI> that is, Leave to proceed to Election, and then after the Election, to crave His Royal assent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he affirms, that King <HI>John</HI> was the first that granted this, which was afterward confirmed by <HI>Westm. 1. cap.</HI> 1. and again, by <HI>Articuli Cleri, cap.</HI> 2.</P>

<P><HI>Conjuration <HI>(Conjuratio)</HI></HI> Signifies a Plot or Confederacy, made by some persons com∣bining themselves together, by oath or promise, to do some publick harm. But it is more espe∣cially used for the having personal conference with the devil, or some evil spirit, to know any secret, or to effect any purpose. <HI>Anno 5 Eliz. cap.</HI> 16. The difference between <HI>Con∣juration</HI> and <HI>Witchcraft</HI> seems to be, because the one endeavors by Prayers and Invocation of Gods powerful names, to compel the divol to say or do what he commands him; the other deals rather by friendly and voluntary con∣ference or agreement with the devil or familiar,
<PB REF="41"/>
to have her, or his desires served, in lieu of blood, or other gift offered him, ospecially of his or her Soul. And both these differ from <HI>Enchantments</HI> or <HI>Sorc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries;</HI> because those are personal conferences with the Divel, as is said; and these are but Medicines and Ceremonial Forms of words (called commonly <HI>Charms)</HI> without Apparition. <HI>Cowel.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Conservator of the Peace <HI>(Conservator vel custos Pacis)</HI></HI> Is he that hath an especial charge, by vertue of his Office, to see the Kings Peace kept: Which <HI>Peace, Lambert</HI> defines to be, a with-holding or abstinence from that injurious force and violence, which boisterous and un∣ruly persons are, in their nature, prone to use towards others, were they not restrained by Laws, and fear of punishment: He farther adds, that before the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, who first erected Justices of Peace, there were sundry persons, who by the Commmon Law, had interest in keeping the Peace. Of those, some had that charge, as incident to the Offices they bore, and so included in the same, that they were called by the name of their Office onely; others had it simply as of it self, and were there∣of named <HI>Custodes Pacis,</HI> Wardens, or Conser∣vators of the Peace.

<P><HI>Consideration <HI>(Consideratio)</HI></HI> Is the mate∣rial cause, the <HI>Quid pro quo</HI> of any Contract, without which no Contract binds. This <HI>Con∣sideration</HI> is either expressed, as if a Man bar∣gain to give Five pounds for a Horse; or im∣plied, as when the Law it self inforces a <HI>Con∣sideration;</HI> as if a Man come into a Common Inn, and there stay some time, taking Meat and Lodging, or either for himself and his Horse, the Law presumes he intends to pay for both, though there be no express Contract be∣twixt him and his Host; and therefore, if he discharge not the House, the Host may stay his Horse. <HI>Fulb.

<P><HI>Consistory <HI>(Consistorium)</HI></HI> Signifies as much as <HI>Praetorium</HI> or <HI>Tribunal.</HI> It is commonly used for a Council-House of Ecclesiastical Persons, or the place of Justice in the Court Christian; a Session or Assembly of Prelates. Every Arch∣bishop and Bishop of every Diocess, hath a <HI>Consistory Court</HI> held before his Chancellor or Commissary in his Cathedral Church, or other convenient place of his Diocess, for Ecclesia∣stical Causes.

<P>This word is diversly used, First for the <HI>Constable of England,</HI> of whose great Dignity and Authority, we may finde many proofs in the Statutes and Chronicles of this Realm.

<P>Out of this High Magistracy of <HI>Constable of England</HI> (says <HI>Lambert)</HI> were drawn those Inferior Constables, which we call <HI>Constables of Hundreds</HI> and <HI>Franchises;</HI> and first ordained by the Statute of <HI>Winchester, Anno 13 Edw.</HI> 1. which appoints for conservation of the Peace, and view of Armor, two Constables in every Hundred and Franchise, which in Latin are called <HI>Constabularii Capitales,</HI> High Constables; because continuance of time and increase, both of People and Offences, hath, under these, made others in every Town called <HI>Petit-Constables,</HI> in Latin <HI>Sub-Constabularios,</HI> which are of like nature, but of Inferior Authority to the other.

<P><HI>Copihold <HI>(Tenura per Copiam Rotuli Curiae)</HI></HI> Is a Tenure for which the Tenant hath nothing to shew, but the <HI>Copy</HI> of the Rolls made by the Steward of his Lords Court. For, as the Ste∣ward enrols and makes Remembrances of all other things done in the Lords Court; so he does also of such Tenants as are admitted in the Court, to any parcel of Land or Tenement belonging to the Mannor, and the Transcript of this, is called the <HI>Court-Roll,</HI> the <HI>Copy</HI> where∣of the Tenant keeps, as his onely evidence. <HI>Coke, lib. 4. fol. 25. b.</HI> This is called a <HI>Base Te∣nure,</HI> because it holds at the Will of the Lord. <HI>Kitchin, fol. 80. cap. Copiholds. Fitzh. (Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 12.) says, It was wont to be called <HI>Te∣nure in Villenage,</HI> and that <HI>Copihold</HI> is but a new name; and yet it is not simply at the Will of the Lord, but according to the Custom of the Mannor. So that if a <HI>Copiholder</HI> break not the Custom of the Mannor, and thereby forfeit his Tenure, he seems not so much to stand at the Lords curtesie for his right, that he may be displaced at his pleasure. These Customs are infinite, varying in one point, or other, almost in every several Mannor.</P>
<P><HI>Copiholders</HI> do upon their Admittances, pay a Fine to the Lord of the Mannor, of whom the Lands are holden, which Fines are in some Mannors certain, in others incertain: Those which are incertain, the Lord rates at what Fine he pleaseth; but if it exceeds two years value, the Courts of <HI>Chancery, Kings Bench, Common Pleas,</HI> or <HI>Exchequer,</HI> have in their several Jurisdictions, power to reduce the Fine unto two years value.</P>
<P><HI>Copiholds,</HI> are a kinde of Inheritance, and called in many places <HI>Customary;</HI> because the Tenant dying, and the <HI>hold</HI> being void, the next of the Blood, paying the Customary Fine, as Two shillings for an Acre, or such like, may not be denied his admission. Secondly, some <HI>Copiholders</HI> have by Custom, the Wood grow∣ing upon their own Land, which by Law they could not have. Thirdly, Others hold? by the Verge in ancient Demesns, and though they hold by <HI>Copy,</HI> yet are they in account a kinde of Freeholder; for if such a one commit Fe∣lony, the King hath <HI>Annum, diem &amp; vastum,</HI> as in case of Freehold; some others hold by Common Tenure, called <HI>Meer Copihold,</HI> whose Land, upon Felony committed, Escheats to the Lord of the Mannor. <HI>Kitchin, fol. 81. Cha. Tenants</HI> per <HI>Verge in ancient Demesn.</HI> This is the Land, which (in the <HI>Saxons</HI> time) was cal∣led <HI>Folkland. <HI>West, (Par. 1.

Religion, whereof he is Founder, towards the reasonable sustenance of such a one of his servants, or vadelets, as he thinks good to bestow it on: The difference between a <HI>Corody</HI> and a <HI>Pension,</HI> seems to be, That a <HI>Corody</HI> is allowed towards the maintenance of any of the Kings servants in an Abbey; a <HI>Pension</HI> is given to one of the Kings Chaplains for his better maintenance, till he may be provided of a Benefice. Of both these, read <HI>Fitzh. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 250. who sets down all the <HI>Corodies</HI> and <HI>Pensions</HI> certain, that any Abbey, when they stood, was bound to perform to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Corody</HI> seems to be ancient in our Law; for in <HI>Westm. 2. cap.</HI> 25. it is ordained, that an Assisc shall lie for a <HI>Corody.</HI> It is also apparent by the Stat. 34 &amp; 35 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 26.

<P><HI>Coroner <HI>(Coronator a Corona)</HI></HI> Is an ancient Officer of this Land (for mention is made of his Office in King <HI>Athelstans</HI> Charter to <HI>Bever∣ley, Anno</HI> 925.) and is so called, because he deals wholly for the King and Crown. There are four of them commonly in every County, in some fewer, and in some Counties but one; they are chosen by the Freeholders of the same by the Kings Writ, and not made by Letters Patent. <HI>Crompt. Jurisd. fol.</HI> 126. This Officer, by the Statute of <HI>Westm. 1. cap.</HI> 10. ought to be a sufficient person, that is, the most wise and discreet Knight, that best would, and might attend upon such an Office, yea, there is a Writ in the <HI>Register, Nisi sit Miles, fol. 177. b.</HI> whereby it appears. it was sufficient cause to remove a <HI>Coroner</HI> chosen, if he were not a Knight, and had not a hundred shillings Rent of Freehold. The Lord Cheif Justice of the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> is the <HI>Soveraign Coroner</HI> of the whole Realm in person, i. wheresoever he abodes, <HI>Lib. Assisarum, fol. 49. Coke, lib. 4.

<P><HI>Corruption of Blood <HI>(Corruptio Sanguinis)</HI></HI> Is an Infection growing to the State of a Man (attainted of Felony or Treason) and to his Issue: For, as he loseth all to the Prince, or other Lord of the Fee, as his case is; so his issue cannot be heirs to him, or to any other Ancestor by him. And, if he were Noble, or a Gentleman before, he and his children are thereby ignobled and ungentiled. But, if the King pardon the offender, it will cleanse the corruption of Blood in those Children, which are born after the Pardon, and they may in∣herit the Land of their Ancestor, purchased at the time of the pardon, or afterward; but so cannot they, who were born before the pardon. Yet note, there are divers offences made Trea∣son by Act of Parliament, whereof, though a Man be Attaint, yet his Blood, by Provisoes therein, is not corrupt, nor shall he forfeit any thing, but what he hath for his own life; for which, see the several Statutes of 5 <HI>Eliz. cap. 1, 11 &amp; 14.—18 Eliz. cap. 1.—31 Eliz. cap.</HI> 4. and 1 <HI>Jac. cap.</HI> 12.</P>

<P><HI>Corsepresent</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Corps presenté,</HI> i. the Body presented) Signifies a <HI>Mortuary, Anno 21 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 6.

<P><HI>Covenant <HI>(Foedus)</HI></HI> The late Solemn League and Covenant, first hatch'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was a Seditious Conspiracy, too well known to need any Explication; it was Voted Illegal and Irreligious by Parliament in <HI>May,</HI> 1661. and provision is made against it by the Statute 14 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 4.

<P><HI>Covent</HI> or <HI>Convent <HI>(Conventus)</HI></HI> Signifies the Society or Fraternity of an Abby or Prio∣ry; as <HI>Societas</HI> does the number of Fellows in a College. <HI>Bracton, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 35.</P>
<P><HI>Coverture</HI> (Fr.) Any thing that covers, as Apparel, a Coverlet; but it is particularly applied to the state and condition of a married Woman, who by our Law is <HI>Sub potestate viri,</HI> and therefore disabled to contract with any, to the prejudice of her self or husband, without his consent and privity, or, at least, without his allowance and confirmation. <HI>Broke, hoc ti∣tulo. Omnia quae sunt uxoris, sunt ipsius viri. Vir est caput mulieris. Sine viro respondere non potest. Bracton, lib. 2. cap. 15. &amp; lib. 4. cap.</HI> 24.

<P><HI>Covine <HI>(Covina)</HI></HI> Is a deceitful Compact or Agreement between two or more, to preju∣dice a third person. As if Tenant for Life conspires with another, that this other shall re∣cover the Land which the Tenant holds, in prejudice of him in Reversion. <HI>Plow. Com. fol.</HI> 546.</P>
<P><HI>Count</HI> (Fr. <HI>Conte)</HI> Signifies the original Declaration in a Real Action; as <HI>Declaration</HI> is, in a personal. <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol. 26. Libellus</HI> with the <HI>Civilians</HI> comprehends both. Yet <HI>Count</HI> and <HI>Declaration</HI> are sometimes confound∣ed, as <HI>Count in Debt. Kitchin, fol. 281. Count</HI> or Declaration in Appeal. <HI>Pl. Cor. fol. 78. Count</HI> in Trespass. <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 26. See <HI>Declaration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Countée</HI> (Fr. <HI>Comte.</HI> A <HI>Comitando,</HI> be∣cause they accompany the King) Was, next to the Duke, the most eminent Dignity of a Sub∣ject, before, as well as since, the Conquest; and those, who in ancient time, were created <HI>Coun∣tees,</HI> were Men of great Estate and Dignity: For which cause, the Law gives them great priviledges; as, their persons may not be ar∣rested for Debt, Trespass, &amp;c. (because the Law intends, that they assist the King with their Council for the Publick Good, and preserve the Realm by their Prowess and Valor;) they may not be put upon Juries. If issue be taken, whether the Plaintiff or Defendant be a <HI>Coun∣tee,</HI> or not, This shall not be tried by the Countrey, but by the Kings Writ. Also the Defendant shall not have a day of Grace against a Lord of the Parliament, because it is in∣tended he attends the Publick. And of old the <HI>Countee</HI> was <HI>Praefectus,</HI> or <HI>Praepositus Comi∣tatus,</HI> and had the charge and custody of the County, whose Authority the Sheriff now hath. <HI>Coke, lib. 9. fol.</HI> 49. And is therefore called <HI>Viscount.</HI> See <HI>Earl.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Countenance,</HI> Seems to be used for credit or estimation. <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 111. And likewise <HI>Anno 1 Edw. 3.

<P><HI>Counter-mand,</HI> Is where a thing formerly executed, is afterward, by some Act or Cere∣mony, made void, by the party that first did it. As, if a Man makes his last Will, and de∣vises his Land to <HI>I. S.</HI> and afterward enfeoffs another of the same Land, here this Feoff∣ment is a <HI>Countermand</HI> to the Will, and the Will void, as to the disposition of the Land.</P>
<P><HI>Counter-plée,</HI> Signifies a Replication to <HI>Ayde Prier;</HI> For, when Tenant by curtesie in Dower, or other Real. Action, prays the View or Aid of the King, or him in the Reversion, for his better defence; or else, if a stranger to the Action begun, desires to be received, to say what he can for the safegard of his Estate,

<P><HI>County <HI>(Comitatus)</HI></HI> Signifies the same with <HI>Shire;</HI> the one coming from the French, the other from the Saxons, both containing a circuit or portion of the Realm, into which the whole Land is divided, for the better Go∣vernment of it, and more easie Administration of Justice: So that there is no part of this Na∣tion that lies not within some <HI>County,</HI> and every <HI>County</HI> is governed by a yearly Officer, whom we call a <HI>Sheriff. Fortescu, cap.</HI> 24. Of these <HI>Counties,</HI> there are four of special mark, which therefore are termed <HI>Counties Palatines,</HI> As <HI>Lancaster, Chester, Durham,</HI> and <HI>Ely.

But by the Statute 27 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 24. This power is much abridged, to which I refer the Reader; as also to <HI>Cromp. Jurisd. fol.</HI> 137. and 4 <HI>Instit. fol. 204, &amp;</HI> 221.</P>

<P><HI>County Court <HI>(Curia Comitatus)</HI></HI> Is by <HI>Lambert</HI> otherwise called <HI>Conventus,</HI> and di∣vided into two sorts; one retaining the gene∣ral name, as, the <HI>County Court</HI> held every Moneth by the Sheriff, or his Deputy the Under-Sheriff.

<P><HI>Court <HI>(Curia)</HI></HI> Signifies the Kings Palace, or Mansion; and more especially the place where Justice is judicially administred, of which, you may finde Thirty two several sorts in <HI>Cromptons Jurisdictions</HI> well described; where∣of most are Courts of Record, some not, and therefore are accounted Base Courts, in com∣parison of the rest. Besides these, there are also <HI>Courts Christian. Smith de Rep. Angl. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 6. which are so called, because they handle matters especially appertaining to <HI>Chri∣stianity,</HI> and such as, without good knowledge in Divinity, cannot be well judged of, being held heretofore by Archbishops and Bishops, as from the Pope, because he challenged the superiority in all Causes Spiritual, but since his ejection, they hold them by the Kings Au∣thority, <HI>Virtute Magistratus sui,</HI> as the Admiral of <HI>England</HI> doth his Court: Whereupon they send out their Precepts, in their own names, and not in the Kings, as the Justices of the Kings Courts do.

<P><HI>Damage</HI> (Lat. <HI>Damnatio,</HI> Fr. <HI>Dommage)</HI> Signifies generally any hurt or hindrance, that a Man receives in his Estate, but particularly, a part of that the Jurors are to enquire of, when the Action (be it real or personal) passeth for the Plaintiff. For, after Verdict given of the principal cause, they are asked their Con∣sciences touching <HI>Costs</HI> (which are the charges of Sute, called by the <HI>Civilians Expensae litis)</HI> and <HI>Damages,</HI> which comprehend a recompence for what the Plaintiff or Demandant hath suffer∣ed, by means of the wrong done him by the the Defendant or Tenant. <HI>Coke on Littl. fol.</HI> 257.</P>
<P><HI>Damage Cléer <HI>(Damna Clericorum)</HI></HI> Is now assessed by the Tenth part in the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and the Twentieth part in the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> and <HI>Exchequer</HI> of all <HI>Damages,</HI> (exceed∣ing Five Marks) recovered either by Verdict, Confession, or Judgment of the Court, in all Actions upon the Case, Covenant, Trespass, Battery, False imprisonment, Dower, and all others, wherein the <HI>Damages</HI> are incertain, which the Plaintiff must pay to the Prothono∣tary or chief Officer of that Court, wherein they are recovered, before he shall have any Executi∣on for them. For example, If one lends another on his word, or note under hand, One hundred pound, or sells commodity to that value; the Lender or Seller is forced to sue in an Action of the Case, recovers, must pay Ten pound, if in the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and Five pound in the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> or <HI>Exchequer,</HI> (and so propor∣tionably for a greater or lesser sum) before he can have Execution. This was originally no other then a gratuity given the Prothonotaries, and their Clerks, for drawing special Writs and Pleadings, which afterwards grew to a cer∣tainty, and was not, as some have fancied, anciently, a Tenth part of the <HI>Damages</HI> re∣covered; For it doth appear by ancient Re∣cords, that it hath been at an incertain rate, sometimes a Sixth, and at other times a Third part. This, by Act of Parliament, 17 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 6. is taken away from and after the 29 of <HI>September,</HI> 1672. And till that time, and no lon∣ger, <HI>Damage Cleer</HI> shall be paid out of such Moneys onely, as shall be actually levied, or otherwise paid by the Defendants, and onely for the proportion of the Money which shall be so levied or paid, and no more, or other∣wise.</P>

<P><HI>Danegelt, Danegold, or Dane-geld (Gelt</HI> in <HI>Dutch</HI> signifies Money) Was a Tri∣bute laid upon our Ancestors of Two shillings for every Hide of Land, through the Realm by the <HI>Danes,</HI> who once mastered us, in regard (as they pretended) of clearing the Seas of Pyrats, which greatly annoyed our Coasts in those days. <HI>Camd.

<P><HI>Dean, <HI>(Gr.</HI></HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>decem,)</HI> Is an Ecclesiastical Magistrate, so called, because he presides over <HI>Ten</HI> Canons or Prebends at the least. We call him a <HI>Dean</HI> that is under the Bishop, and chief of the Chapter, ordinarily in a Cathedral Church; and, the rest of the So∣ciety or Corporation we call <HI>Capitulum,</HI> the <HI>Chapter.</HI> But, how diversly this word is used, read <HI>Lindwood, Tit. de Constitut. ca. 1. verbo, Decani Rurales;</HI> where <HI>Rural Deans</HI> are said to be certain persons that have Jurisdiction Ec∣clesiastical over other Ministers and Parishes neer adjoyning, assigned them by the Bishop and Arch-Deacon, being placed and displaced by them: Such are the <HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>Croiden</HI> in <HI>Surrey, Dean</HI> of <HI>Battel</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As there are two Foundations of <HI>Cathedral Churches</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the old and the new, (the new are those which <HI>Henry the Eighth</HI> upon Sup∣pression of Abbies transformed from Abbot, or Prior and Convent, to <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter,)</HI> so are there two means of Creating these Deans: For, those of the Old Foundation were exalted to their Dignity much like Bishops; the King first sending out his <HI>Conge d'Eslire</HI> to the <HI>Chap∣ter,</HI> the <HI>Chapter</HI> then chusing, the King yielding His Royal Assent, and the Bishop Confirming him, and giving his Mandate to enstal him. Those of the New Foundation are by a shorter course Enstalled, by Vertue of the Kings Let∣ters-Patent, without either Election or Con∣firmation. This word is also applyed to di∣vers that are the chief of certain peculiar Churches or Chappels, as the <HI>Dean of the Kings Chappel,</HI> the <HI>Dean of the Arches,</HI> the <HI>Dean of St. Georges Chappel</HI> in <HI>Windsor,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Nec Collegio alicui praefecti, nec jurisdictione ulla donati, no∣mine tamen velut honoris gratia insignes,</HI> sayes <HI>Spelman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>De bene esse,</HI> Are three common Latin words, but their signification more mysteri∣ous, conceiv'd to be thus, To take or do any thing <HI>De bene esse,</HI> is to accept or allow it, as well done for present; but, when it comes to be more fully examin'd or try'd, to stand or fall, to be allowed or disallowed, according to the Merit or Well-being of the thing in its own nature; or (as we say) <HI>Valeat quantum valere potest:</HI> So in <HI>Chancery,</HI> upon motion to have one of the less-principal Defendants in a Case, examin'd as a Witness, the Court (not then throughly examining the justice of it, or not hearing what may be objected on the other side) often orders such a Defendant to be ex∣amined <HI>de bene esse. i.</HI> That his Depositi∣ons shall be allowed or suppressed at the Hear∣ing of the Cause, upon the full debate of the Mat∣ter, as the Court shall then think fit, but for the present they have a <HI>well-being,</HI> or conditional∣allowance.

<P><HI>Debentur,</HI> Was by a <HI>Rum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Act</HI> in 1649, ordained to be in the nature of a Bond or Bill, to charge the Common-wealth (forsooth) to pay the Souldier-Creditor, or his Assignes the Sum due upon Auditing the Account of his Ar∣rears. The Form of which <HI>Debentur,</HI> as then used, you may see in <HI>Scobels Rump-Acts Anno 1649, ca.</HI> 63. The word is also men∣tion'd in the Act of <HI>Oblivion, 12 Car. 2. ca. 8.

<HI>Debet &amp; solet,</HI> Are Latin words, often used in our Law-Writers. In old <HI>Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 98. it is said, This Writ <HI>De secta molendini,</HI> be∣ing in the <HI>debet</HI> and <HI>solet,</HI> is a Writ of Right, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And again, <HI>fol.</HI> 69. A Writ of <HI>quod per∣mittat</HI> may be pleaded in the County before the Sheriff; and, it may be in the <HI>debet,</HI> and <HI>solet,</HI> or in the <HI>debet,</HI> without the <HI>solet,</HI> according as the Demandant claims. Wherefore note, that those Writs which are in this sort brought, have these words in them as Formal words, not to be omitted. And, according to the diver∣sity of the Case, both <HI>debet</HI> and <HI>solet</HI> are used, or <HI>debet</HI> alone; That is, if a man sue to reco∣ver any Right, whereof his Ancestor was dis∣seis'd by the Tenant or his Ancestor, then he useth only the word <HI>debet</HI> in his Writ; because <HI>solet</HI> is not fit by reason his Ancestor was dis∣seis'd and the Custom discontinued: but, if he sue for any thing that is now first of all de∣ny<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him, then he useth both these words; be∣cause his Ancestors before him, and he himself usually enjoyed the thing sued for, as sute to a Mill, or Common of Pasture, until this pre∣sent refusal of the Tenant.

In later times I find mention of them, as in <HI>Britton. ca.</HI> 12. who sayes, in the Kings Per∣son, (for so he Writes his whole Book,) <HI>We will, that all those who are 14 years old, shall make Oath, That they shall be sufficient and loy∣al to Us; and, neither be Felons, nor assenting to Felons: And, We will, That all Profess them∣selves to be of this or that</HI> Dozein, <HI>and make, or offer Surety of their Behaviour by these or those</HI> Doziners; <HI>except Religious Persons, Clerks, Knights eldest Sons, and Women.</HI> Yet, the same Author in his 29th <HI>Chap.</HI> sayes, all of 12 years old and upwards are punishable for not coming to the Sheriffs Turn, except Earles, Prelates, Barons, Religious persons, and Women. <HI>Stamf.

<P>We may note out of the Premisses, a diver∣sity between the ancient and these modern times, in this Point of Law and Government, as well in the age of those who are to be sworn, as also that <HI>Decennier</HI> is not now used for the chief Man of a <HI>Dozein,</HI> but for him that is sworn to the Kings Peace; and lastly, That now there are no other <HI>Dozeins</HI> but Leets, and that no Man ordinarily gives other security for keeping the Kings Peace, but his own Oath, and that therefore no Man answers for anothers transgression, but every Man for himself.

<P><HI>Déed <HI>(Factum)</HI></HI> Is an Instrument written in Parchment or Paper, consisting of three things, <HI>viz.

A <HI>Deed Indented,</HI> is a Deed consisting of two parts, or more (for there are Tripartite and Quadripartite Deeds) in which it is expressed, That the parties thereto, have to every part thereof interchangably set their several Seals. The cause of their Indenting is, that it may appear they belong to one business or contract. A <HI>Deed Poll</HI> or polled (anciently called <HI>Charta de una parte)</HI> is a plain Deed without Indent∣ing; as if we should say, The Indenting is <HI>polled</HI> or cut off; and is used, when the Vendor for example onely Seals, and there is no need of the Vendees sealing a Counterpart, by rea∣son the nature of the Contract is such, as it requires no Covenant from the Vendee, unless in such case the Vendor will out of caution or curiosity have a Counterpart, to see, upon any occasion, what Covenants himself hath given.

<P><HI>Defender of the Faith <HI>(Defensor fidei)</HI></HI> Is a peculiar title given to the Kings of <HI>England</HI> by the Pope, as <HI>Catholicus</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain, Christianissimus</HI> to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Advocatus Ecclesiae</HI> to the Emperor: Which title was given by Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the Tenth to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, for writing against <HI>Martin Luther,</HI> in behalf of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the <HI>Bull</HI> for it bears date <HI>Quinto Idus Octobr.</HI> 1521. which may be seen at length in the Lord <HI>Herberts</HI> History of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, <HI>fol.</HI> 105.</P>

<P><HI>Deforceor <HI>(Deforciator,</HI></HI> of the Fr. <HI>Forceur, i. expugnator)</HI> Is one that overcomes and casts out by force, and differs from <HI>Disseisor:</HI> First in this, because a Man may disseise another without <HI>force,</HI> which is called <HI>Simple Disseisin. Britton, cap.</HI> 53. Next, because a Man may <HI>de∣force</HI> another that never was in <HI>possession.</HI> For example, if more have right to Lands, as Common Heirs, and one entring, keeps out the rest, the Law says, He <HI>deforceth</HI> them, though he do not disseise them. <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 118. And <HI>Littleton, (cap. Discontinuance, fol.</HI> 117.) says, He who is inseoffed by the Tenant in Tail, and put in Possession, by keeping out the Heir of him in Reversion being dead, doth <HI>deforce</HI> him, though he did not <HI>disseise</HI> him; because he entered, when the Tenant in Tail was living, and the Heir had no present right. A <HI>Deforceor</HI> differs from an <HI>Intruder,</HI> because a Man is made an <HI>Iutruder</HI> by a wrongful entry onely into Land or Tenement void of a Pos∣sessor; And a <HI>Deforceor</HI> is he that holds out the right Heir as abovesaid. <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. cap.</HI> 1.</P>

De∣mains</HI> (according to common speech) are the Lords chief Mannor place, with the Lands thereto belonging, which he and his Ancestors have from time to time kept in their own Manu∣al occupation; howbeit (according to Law) all the parts of a Mannor (except what is in the hands of Freeholders) are said to be <HI>De∣mains.</HI> And the reason why Copihold is account∣ed <HI>Demain,</HI> is because Copiholders are adjudged in Law to have no other estate, but at the will of the Lord; so that it is still reputed to be in a manner in the Lords hands.</P>
<P><HI>Demain</HI> is sometimes used in a more special signification, as opposite to <HI>Frank-fee:</HI> For example, those Lands which were in the posses∣sion of King <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor,</HI> are called <HI>Ancient Demains,</HI> and all others <HI>Frank-fee;</HI> and the Tenants which hold any of those Lands are called <HI>Tenants in Ancient Demain;</HI> the others, <HI>Tenants in Frank-fee.

<P><HI>Demand</HI> (Fr. <HI>Demande, i. postulatio)</HI> Sig∣nifies a calling upon a Man for any thing due. It hath also a proper signification, distinguished from <HI>Plaint:</HI> For all Civil Actions are pur∣sued, either by <HI>Demands</HI> or <HI>Plaints;</HI> and the pursuer is called <HI>Demandant</HI> or <HI>Plaintiff, viz. Demandant</HI> in Actions Real, and <HI>Plaintiff</HI> in

As a Release of Sutes is more large then a Release of Quarrels or Acti∣ons; so a Release of <HI>Demands</HI> is more large and beneficial, then either of them. By Re∣lease of all <HI>Demands,</HI> all Executions, and all Freeholds and Inheritances executory are re∣leased; By Release of all <HI>Demands</HI> to the Dis∣seisor, the right of Entry in the Land, and all that is contained therein, is released. And he that releaseth all <HI>Demands,</HI> excludes himself from all Actions, Entries, and Seisures; but a Release of all <HI>Demands,</HI> is no Bar in a Writ of Error to Reverse an Outlary. <HI>Coke, lib. 8. fol.</HI> 153, 154.</P>
<P><HI>Demandant <HI>(Petens)</HI></HI> Is he, who is Actor or Plaintiff in a Real Action, because he de∣mandeth Lands, <HI>&amp;c. Coke on Littl. fol. 127. b.</HI> See <HI>Demand.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Demurrer</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Demeurer, i. Ma∣nere in aliquo loco, vel morari)</HI> Is a kinde of pause or stop put to the proceedings of any Action upon a point of difficulty, which must be determined by the Court, before any further proceedings can be had therein: For in every Action, the Controversie consists, either in Fact or in Law; if in Fact, that is tried by the Jury; if in Law, the Case is plain to the Judge, or so hard and rare, as it breeds just doubt. We call that plain to the Judge, where∣in he is assured of the Law; though perhaps the party and his Council yield not to it: And in such case, the Judge with his Associats, pro∣ceed to Judgment, without more ado; but when it is doubtful, then stay is made, and a time taken, either for the Court to consider further of it, and agree if they can; or else, for all the Judges, to meet together in the <HI>Ex∣chequer Chamber,</HI> and upon hearing what the Serjeants can say on both sides, to determine what is Law, And whatsoever they conclude, stands firm without further Appeal. <HI>Smith de Repub. Angl. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 13. This <HI>Demurrer</HI> is in our Records expressed in Latin by <HI>Moratur in Lege.</HI> At the Common Law, the Defendant sometimes <HI>demurreth</HI> to the Plaintiffs Count or Declaration, and sometimes the Plaintiff <HI>de∣murs</HI> to the Defendants Plea, by averring, That it is not a sufficient Plea in the Law, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In <HI>Chancery,</HI> the Defendant <HI>demurs</HI> to the Plain∣tiffs Bill, averring it to be defective in such, or such a point, and demands the Judgment of the Court thereupon, whether he shall be compelled to make any further or other answer thereunto, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Moratur in Lege.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Denizen</HI> (Fr. <HI>Donaison, i. Donatio)</HI> Sig∣nifies an Alien that is enfranchised here in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> by the Kings Charter and Donation, and enabled in many respects, to do, as the Kings Native Subjects do, namely, to purchase and possess Lands, to be capable of any Office or Dignity. Yet is it short of <HI>Naturalization;</HI> because a stranger <HI>naturalized</HI> may inherit Lands by descent, which a <HI>Denizen</HI> cannot. And again in the Charter, whereby a Man is made <HI>Denizen,</HI> there is commonly contained some one clause or other, that abridges him of that full benefit which natural subjects enjoy. And when a Man is thus enfranchised, he is said to be under the Kings Protection, or <HI>Esse ad fidem Regis Angliae;</HI> before which time, he can enjoy nothing in <HI>England. Bracton (lib. 5. tract. 5. cap. 25. num.</HI> 3.) saith, That he and his goods might be seised to the Kings use. See <HI>Horns Mirror, lib. 1. cap. de la Venue de Franc-plege,</HI> and 2 <HI>Part.

<P><HI>Deodand <HI>(Deodandum)</HI></HI> Is a thing given or forfeited, as it were to God for the pacification of his Wrath, in a Case of Misadventure, whereby a Christian Soul comes to a violent end, without the fault of any reasonable Crea∣ture. As, if a Horse strike his Keeper and kill him: If a Man, in driving a Cart, falls so, as the Cart-wheel runs over him, and presses him to death: If one be felling a Tree, and gives warning to the standers by, to look to them∣selves, yet a Man is killed by the fall of it. In the first of these Cases, the Horse; in the second, the Cart-wheel, Cart, and Horses; and in the third, the Tree is to be <HI>given to God,</HI> that is, to be sold and distributed to the Poor, by the Kings Almoner, for expiation of this dreadful event, though effected by unreason∣able, yea, sensless and dead creatures. <HI>Stamf.

<P><HI>Fleta</HI> says, This <HI>Deodand</HI> is to be sold, and the price distributed to the Poor, for the Soul of the King, his Ancestors, and all faithful people departed this life. <HI>Lib. 1. cap. 25. De Submersis.</HI> Which Law seems to bear an imitation of that in <HI>Exodus, cap. 21. Si cornu perierit bos virum vel mulierem, ita ut moriatur, lapidabitur bos neque comedetur caro ejus, ac Dominus ejus crit innocens.</HI> This word is mentioned in the Stat. <HI>De Officio Coronatoris, Anno 4 Edw.</HI> 1. See 3 <HI>Part. Inst. fol.</HI> 57.</P>
<P><HI>Deoneranda pro rata portionis,</HI> Is a Writ that lies where one is distrained for a Rent, that ought to be paid by others propor∣tionably with him. For example, a Man holds ten Oxgangs of Land, by Fealty, and ten shillings Rent of the King, and aliens one Ox∣gang thereof to one, and another to another in Fee: Afterward, the Sheriff or other Of∣ficer distrains onely one of them for the Rent, he that is so distrained, may have this Writ for his relief. <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 234.</P>
<P><HI>Departer</HI> or <HI>Departure</HI> Is a word properly applied to him, who, first pleading one thing in Bar of an Action, and being replied unto, does in his Rejoynder, wave that, and shew another matter contrary, or not pursuing his first Plea. <HI>Plow∣den in Reneger and Fagossa, fol.</HI> 7, 8. Or it may be applied to a Plaintiff, who in his Replica∣tion, shews new matter from his Declaration. As in <HI>Crokes 2 Part, Bagshaws</HI> Case, <HI>fol. 147. The Defendant hereupon demurred, because it was a</HI> departure <HI>from the Declaration.</HI> So if a Man plead a General Agreement in Bar, and in his Rejoynder alleage a special one, this shall be adjudged a <HI>Departure in Pleading.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Departure in despight of the Court,</HI> Is when the Tenant or Detendant appears to the Action brought against him, and hath a day over in the same Term, or is called after, though he had no day given him, so it be in the same Term; if he do not appear, but make default, it is a <HI>Departure in despight of the Court,</HI> and therefore he shall be condemn∣ed; which <HI>departure</HI> is always of the part of the Tenant or Defendant, and the Entry of it is, <HI>Quod praedictus</HI> A, <HI>licet solenniter exactus, non revenit, sed in contemptum Curiae, recessit &amp; defaltum fecit</HI> Coke, lib. 8. fol. 62.</P>
<P><HI>Departers of Gold and Silver.</HI> See <HI>Finors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Depopulation <HI>(Depopulatio)</HI></HI> A wasting, pilling, or destruction; a desolation, or un∣peopling of any place. <HI>Cokes 12 Rep. fol.</HI> 30.</P>
<P><HI>Depopulatores agrorum,</HI> It appears by the Stat. 4 <HI>Hen. 4. cap.</HI> 2. that they were great offenders by the ancient Law, and that the Ap∣peal or Indictment of them, ought not to be General, but in Special manner. They are cal∣led <HI>Depopulatores Agrorum,</HI> for that by pro∣strating or decaying the Houses or Habitation of the Kings people, they <HI>depopulate,</HI> that is, dispeople the Towns. 3 <HI>Part.

<P><HI>Deposition <HI>(Depositio)</HI></HI> Is the Testimony of a Witness, otherwise called a <HI>Deponent,</HI> put down in writing by way of answer to Interro∣gatories, exhibited to that purpose in the Court of <HI>Chancery;</HI> And when such witness is exami∣ned in open Court, he is said to be examined <HI>Viva voce.

In some places the Substantive <HI>Dereinment</HI> is used in the very literal signification with the French <HI>Disrayer</HI> or <HI>desranger,</HI> that is, turning out of course, displacing or setting out of order; as <HI>Deraignment</HI> or departure out of Religion, <HI>Anno 31 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 6. and 5 <HI>&amp; 6 Edw. 6. cap.</HI> 13.

To this is answe∣rable in some sort <HI>actio depositi</HI> in the Civil Law.

<P><HI>Devastaverunt bona Testatoris,</HI> Is a Writ lying against Executors, for paying Lega∣cies and Debts without Specialties, to the pre∣judice of the Creditors that have Specialties, before the Debts on the said Specialties are due; for in this Case the Executors are as lia∣ble to Action, as if they had wasted the Goods of the Testator riotoufly, or converted them to their own use; and are compellable to pay such Debts by Specialty out of their own Goods, to the value of what they so paid ille∣gally.

<P><HI>Devenerunt, <HI>(lat.)</HI></HI> Is a Writ anciently directed to the Escheator, when any of the Kings Tenants, holding in <HI>Capite,</HI> dyed; and when his son and heir, within age, and in the Kings custody, dyed; then this Writ went forth, commanding the Escheator, that he, by the Oath of good and lawful men, enquire what Lands and Tenements, by the death of the Tenant, <HI>came</HI> to the King. See <HI>Dyer, fol. 360. Pl.</HI> 4. and <HI>Keilways Rep. fol. 199. a.</HI> Though this Writ in the sence abovesaid be disused, yet a new use of it is prescribed by Act of Parl. 14 <HI>Car. 2. ca.</HI> 11. Entituled, <HI>An Act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses in His Majesties Customes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Devest, <HI>(Devestire)</HI></HI> Is contrary to <HI>Invest;</HI> for, as <HI>Invest</HI> signifies to deliver the posession of any thing; so <HI>Devest</HI> signifies the taking it away.</P>
<P><HI>Devise, or Divise,</HI> (from the <HI>French, De∣viser,</HI> to confer, or converse with; or from <HI>Diviser,</HI> to divide, or sort into several parcels) Is properly that act, by which a Testator gives, or bequeaths his Lands or Goods, by his last Will in Writing. He who makes the <HI>Devise</HI> is called the <HI>Devisor;</HI> and he to whom the <HI>Devise</HI> is made, the <HI>Devisee.</HI> The words of a Will the Law interprets in a larger and more favourable sence then those of a Deed; For, if Land be <HI>Devised</HI> to a man, to have to him for ever, or to have to him and his Assignes; in these two Cases the <HI>Devisee</HI> shall have a Feesimple; but, <HI>given</HI> in the same manner by Feoffment, he has but an Estate for term of life. So, if one <HI>De∣vise</HI> Land to an Infant in his Mothers Belly, it is a good <HI>Devise;</HI> but, 'tis otherwise by Feoff∣ment, Grant or Gift, for in those Cases, there ought to be one of ability, to take presently, otherwise it is void. 14 <HI>Eliz.

<P><HI>Disability, <HI>(disabilitas,)</HI></HI> Is, when a man is <HI>disabled,</HI> or made incapable, to inherit or take that benefit which otherwise he might have done; which may happen four wayes; by the act of the Party, or his Ancestor; by the act of Law, or of God. <HI>Disability</HI> by the parties <HI>own act,</HI> is, If I bind my self, that upon surrender of a Lease, I will grant a new Estate to the Lessee, and afterwards I grant over my Rever∣sion; In this case, though I afterwards repur∣chase the reversion, yet I have forfeited my Obligation, because I was once disabled to per∣form it. <HI>Coke lib. 5. fol.</HI> 21. Also if a Man be Excommunicated, he cannot, during that time, sue any Action, but shall be thereby <HI>disabled. Coke lib. 8. fol. 69. Disability</HI> by the <HI>act of an Ancestor</HI> is, if a man be attainted of Treason or Felony; by this attainder, his blood is cor∣rupt, and both himself and children <HI>disabled</HI> to inherit. <HI>Disability</HI> by the <HI>Act of Law</HI> is most properly, when a Man by the sole act of the Law is <HI>disabled;</HI> and so is an Alien born, who is <HI>disabled</HI> to take any benefit thereby. <HI>Disa∣bility</HI> by the <HI>Act of God,</HI> is, where a man is not of whole Memory, which <HI>disables</HI> him so, that in all cases, where he passeth any Estate out of him, it may, after his death, be disanull'd; for it is a <HI>Maxim</HI> in Law, <HI>That a Man of full Age shall never be recceav'd to</HI> disable <HI>his own person.

<P><HI>Discent,</HI> (Latin, <HI>Discensus.</HI> French <HI>Des∣cente,)</HI> An order or means whereby Lands or Tenements are derived unto any Man from his Ancestors; As to make his <HI>discent</HI> from his An∣cestors, <HI>(Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 101.) is to shew how and by what particular degrees the Land in question came to him from his Ancestors. This <HI>Discent</HI> is either <HI>Lineal</HI> or <HI>Collateral; Lineal Discent</HI> is convey'd downward, in a right-line, from the Grandfather to the Father, and from the Father to the Son, and from the Son to the Nephew, <HI>&amp;c. Collateral Discent</HI> springs out of the side of the whole blood, as Grandfathers brother, Fathers brother, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If one die seised of Land (in which another has right to enter,) and it des∣cends to his Heir, such <HI>discent</HI> shall take away the others right of entry, and put him to his Action for recovery thereof. <HI>Stat. 32 Hen. 8. ca. 33.

<P><HI>Disclaimer,</HI> (from the French, <HI>Clamer,</HI> with the privative <HI>Dis,)</HI> Is a Plea containing an express denyal, renouncing, or disclaiming. As, if the Tenant sue a Replevin upon a Di∣stress taken by the Lord, and the Lord Avow, saying, That he holds of him, as of his Lord, and that he Distreyned for Rent not paid, or Service not perform'd; then the Tenant, de∣nying to hold of such Lord, is said to <HI>Disclaim,</HI> and the Lord proving the Tenant to hold of him, the Tenant loseth his Land. Also if a man denying himself to be of the Blood or Kindred of another in his Plea, is said to <HI>Disclaim</HI> his Blood. See <HI>Coke on Litt. fol.</HI> 102. and <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 197. If a man Arraigned of Fe∣lony, <HI>Disclaim</HI> Goods; being cleared, he loseth them. See <HI>Broke,</HI> and <HI>New Book of Entries,</HI> tit. <HI>Disclaimer:</HI> And <HI>Stamf. Pl.

<P><HI>Discontinuance, <HI>(Discontinuatio,)</HI></HI> Signi∣fies an interruption, intermission, or breaking off; as <HI>Discontinuance</HI> of Possession, or of Pro∣cess: The effect of <HI>Discontinuance</HI> of Posses∣sion is this, That a Man may not enter upon his own Land or Tenement alienated, whatsoe∣ver his right be to it, of his own self, or by his own authority, but must bring his Writ, and seek to recover Possession by Law: As if a Man alien the Lands he hath in right of his Wife, or if Tenant in Taile make any Feoff∣ment, or Lease for Life, not warranted by the Stat. 32 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. by Fine, or Livery of Seizin, such Alienations are called <HI>Discontinuances;</HI> which are indeed impediments to an Entry, whereby the true owner is left onely to his Action. See the <HI>Institutes of the Common-Law, ca.</HI> 43. and <HI>Cokes Reports, lib. 3. Case of Fines.</HI> The effect of <HI>Discontinuance</HI> of Plea, is, That the opportunity of Prosecution is lost, and not recoverable, but by beginning a new Sute; For to be <HI>Discontinued,</HI> and to be put without Day is all one, and nothing else but finally to be dismissed the Court for that instant. So <HI>Crompton, in his Jurisdict. fol.</HI> 131. useth it, in these words, <HI>If a Justice Seat be</HI> Discon∣tinued, <HI>by the not coming of the Justices, the King may renew the same by His Writ,</HI> &amp;c.

By the <HI>Canon Law</HI> there are two sorts of <HI>degrading,</HI> one <HI>Summary,</HI> by word onely; the other, <HI>So∣lemn,</HI> by devesting the party degraded of those Ornaments and Rights, which are the Ensigns of his Order or Degree.

<P><HI>Disherison</HI> (Fr. <HI>Desheritement)</HI> Is an old word, signifying as much as <HI>Disinheriting.</HI> It is used in the Statute of <HI>Vouchers,</HI> made 20 <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. <HI>Our Lord the King, considering his own damage and disherison of his Crown, &amp;c.</HI> And in 8.

<P><HI>Disrationare, <HI>Est contrarium ratiocinando asserere, vel quod assertum est ratiocinando de∣struere.</HI></HI> We now call it <HI>Traversare,</HI> to Traverse. See <HI>Gloss. in decem Scriptor.</HI> And <HI>Deraign.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Disseisin</HI> (Fr. <HI>Dissaisine,</HI> not from <HI>Dissei∣sir,</HI> as <HI>Cowel</HI> mistakes it) Signifies an unlaw∣ful dispossessing a Man of his Land, Tene∣ment, or other immovable or incorporeal right. And how far this extends, see <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. cap.</HI> 3. Therefore the Assises are called <HI>Writs of Disseisin,</HI> that lie against <HI>Disseisors</HI> in any Case, whereof some are termed little Writs of <HI>Disseisin,</HI> being <HI>Vicontiel,</HI> that is suable before the <HI>Sheriff</HI> in the County Court, be∣cause determined by him without Assise. <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol.</HI> 98.

<P><HI>Distress</HI> (Fr.) Signifies most commonly a Compulsion in certain Real Actions, whereby to cause a Man to appear in Court, or to pay Rent, or other duty denied; or it is the thing distreined. The effect whereof most com∣monly is, To compel the party Distreined to Replevy the Distress, and so take his Action of Trespass against the Distreiner, or else to compound neighborly with him for the Debt or Duty, for which he Distreins. There are di∣vers things not distreinable, as another Mans Gown in the House of a Tailor, or Cloth in the House of a Fuller, Sheerman, or Weaver: For they, being common Artificers, it is pre∣sumed such things belong not to themselves, but to others. <HI>Victual</HI> is not distreinable, nor <HI>Corn</HI> in Sheaves, unless they be in a Cart: For a Distress ought to be of such things, whereof the Sheriff may make Replevin, and deliver again in as good Case, as they were at the time of the taking. A Man may <HI>Distrein</HI> for Homage of his Tenant, for Fealty, Escuage, and other services, and for Fines, and Amerceaments as∣sessed in a Leet, but not in a Court Baron, and for Damage-feasant, &amp;c. But not for Rent due for any Land, except upon the same Land charged therewith, &amp;c. When one hath taken a <HI>Distress,</HI> it behoves him to bring it to the Com∣mon Pound, or he may keep it in an open place, so that he give notice to the party, that he (if the <HI>Distress</HI> be a Quick-beast) may give
<PB REF="52"/>
it food. See the Stat. <HI>De districtione Scaccarii, 51 Hen.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Distress,</HI> is by <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 71. divided into <HI>Personal</HI> and <HI>Real. Distress Personal</HI> is made by distreining a Mans movable Goods, and seising all the profits of his Lands and Tene∣ments from the <HI>Teste,</HI> or date of the Writ, for the Defendants contempt, in not appearing to an Action brought against him, after he was Summoned or Attached; and the Issues so re∣turned by the Sheriffs, are forfeited to the King, and Estreated into the <HI>Exchequer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Distress Real,</HI> is made upon immovable Goods. This differs from an <HI>Attachment</HI> in this (among others) that it cannot be taken by any common person, without the compass of his own Fee; except it be presently after the Cattle, or other thing, is driven or born off the Ground, purposely to avoid the Distress. <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 904. See <HI>Attach.</HI> and the Stat. 17 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 7.</P>
<P><HI>Distress</HI> is also divided into <HI>Finite</HI> and <HI>In∣finite; Finite</HI> is that which is limited by Law, how often it shall be made to bring the party to tryal of the Action, as once, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c. <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol. 43. Distress infin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> is with∣out limitation, until the party come; as against a Jury, which refuseth to appear upon Certifi∣cate of Assise, the Process is <HI>Venire facias, Habeas corpora,</HI> and <HI>Distress infinite. Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 113. Then it is divided into a <HI>Grand Distress (Anno 52 Hen. 3. cap.</HI> 7.) which <HI>Fitz∣herbert</HI> calls <HI>Magnam Districtionem,</HI> and an <HI>Or∣dinary Distress.</HI> A <HI>Grand Distress</HI> is that which is made of all the Goods and Chattels that the party hath within the County. <HI>Britton, cap. 26. fol.</HI> 52. But see whether it be not sometimes <HI>all one</HI> with a <HI>Distress infinite. Idem, fol.</HI> 80. With whom also the Statute of <HI>Marlbridge</HI> seems to agree. <HI>Anno 52 Hen. 3. cap. 7, 9 &amp;</HI> 12. See <HI>Grand Distress</HI> and <HI>Attachment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>District <HI>(Districtus)</HI></HI> Is the place in which a Man hath the power of distreining, or the Cir∣cuit or Territory wherein one may be compel∣led to appear. <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 120. Where we say, <HI>Hors de son Fee,</HI> others say, <HI>Extra districtum suum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Distringas,</HI> Is a Writ directed to the Sheriff, or any other Officer, commanding him to Distrein one for a Debt to the King, &amp;c. or for his not appearance at a day. See great diversity of this Writ in the Table of <HI>Register, Judic. verbo Distringas.</HI> This was sometimes of old called <HI>Constringas,</HI> as appears by this Writ in <HI>Henry</HI> the First or second days. <HI>Lib. Rames. sect.</HI> 227. Henricus <HI>Rex Angliae hominibus Ab∣batis de</HI> Ramesia <HI>salutem.

<P><HI>Domicellus</HI> and <HI>Domicella. <HI>John</HI></HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> had by <HI>Katherine Swinford,</HI> before marriage, four illegitimate Children, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Dower by the Common Law,</HI> Is a Third Part of such Lands, as the Husband was sole seised of in Fee, during the Marriage, which the Wife is to enjoy, during her life; for which, there lies a Writ of Dower. <HI>Dower by Custom,</HI> gives the Wife, in some places, half her Husbands Lands, so long as she lives sole, as in <HI>Gavelkind:</HI> And as <HI>Custom</HI> may enlarge, so may it abridge <HI>Dower,</HI> and restrain it to a fourth part. <HI>Ex Assensu Patris, ad Ostium Ecclesiae,</HI> the Wife may have so much <HI>Dower,</HI> as shall be so assigned or agreed upon, but it ought not to exceed a third part of the Hus∣bands Lands. <HI>Glanv. lib. 6. cap.</HI> 1. And if it be done before Marriage, it is called a <HI>Joynture. Dower de la Plus Bele,</HI> Is when the Wife is endowed of the <HI>fairest,</HI> or best part of her Husbands Estate.

<P>The Officers belonging to this Court, are, the <HI>Chancellour, Atturney, Receiver-General, Clerk of the Court, Messenger:</HI> Besides which, there are certain Assistants, as one <HI>Atturney</HI> in the Exchequer, one <HI>Atturney</HI> of the Dutchy in Chancery, four Persons learned in the Law, re∣tained of Councel with the King in the said Court; whereof <HI>Gwin</HI> (in Preface to his <HI>Rea∣dings,)</HI> speaks thus; <HI>It grew out of the grant of King</HI> Edward the Third, <HI>who gave that Dutchy to his Son</HI> John of Gant, <HI>and endowed it with such Royal Right, as the County Palatine of</HI> Che∣ster <HI>had.</HI> And, for as much as it was afterward extinct in the Person of King <HI>Henry the Fourth,</HI> by reason of the Union of it with the Crown, the same King (suspecting himself to be more rightfully <HI>Duke of Lancaster,</HI> then King of <HI>Eng∣land,)</HI> determined to save his Right in the <HI>Dutchy,</HI> whatever should befall the King∣dom; and therefore he separated the <HI>Dutchy</HI> from the Crown, and setled it so in the natural Persons of Himself and his Heires, as if he had been no King or Politic Body at all; In which condition it continued, during the Reign of <HI>Henry the Fifth,</HI> and <HI>Henry the Sixth,</HI> that descended from him, But, when <HI>Henry the Fourth</HI> had, (by recovery of the Crown,) re∣continued the Right of the House of <HI>York,</HI> he feared not to appropriate that <HI>Dutchy</HI> to the Crown again; yet so, that he suffer'd the Court and Officers to remain as he found them; In which manner it came, together with the Crown, to <HI>Henry the Seventh,</HI> who, liking well of
<PB REF="54"/>
<HI>Henry the Fourths</HI> Policy, (by whose Right also he obtained the Kingdom,) made a like sepa∣ration of the Dutchy, and so left it to His Po∣sterity, who still injoy it. <HI>Cowel.</HI></P>

<P><HI>EAlderman, or Ealdorman, <HI>(Alderman∣nus)</HI></HI> Among the <HI>Saxons,</HI> was as much as <HI>Earl</HI> among the <HI>Danes. Cam. Britan. pa.</HI> 107.

<P><HI>Earl, <HI>(Sax.</HI></HI> Eorl, <HI>Comes,)</HI> This Title, in ancient times, was given to those, who were Affociates to the King in his Councels, and Martial-Actions; And, the manner of their Investiture into that Dignity, was, <HI>Por cinctu∣ram gladio Comitatus;</HI> without any Formal Charter of Creation. See Mr. <HI>Dugdales War∣wickshire, fol.</HI> 302. But, the Conquerour, (as <HI>Camden</HI> notes) gave this Dignity, in Fee, to His Nobles, annexing it to this or that County, or Province; and, allotted them, for their Maintenance, a certain proportion of Money arising from the Princes Profits, for the Plead∣ings, and Forfeitures of the Provinces: For example, he brings an ancient Record in these words; <HI>Henricus 2. Rex Angliae, bis verbis</HI> Co∣mitem <HI>creavit; Sciatis nos fecisse</HI> Hugonem Bi∣got <HI>Comitem de Norf.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>de tertio denario de Norwic. &amp; Northfolk; sicut aliquis Comes An∣gliae liberius Comitatum suum tenet.</HI> About the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> and ever since, our Kings have made <HI>Earles</HI> by their Charter, of this or that County, Province, or City; but, of late, giving them no Authority over the County, nor any part of the Profits arising by it; onely some Annual Fee out of the Exchequer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The manner of their Creation is, by Girding them with a Sword. <HI>Cam. pa.</HI> 107. but, see the Solemnity described more at large in <HI>Stowes Annals, pa.</HI> 1121.

An <HI>Inditement</HI> is alwayes at the Sute of the King, and differs from an Accusati∣on in this, That the Preferrer of the Bill is no way tied to the Proof of it, upon any Penalty, except there appear conspiracy.

<P><HI>Enfranchise,</HI> (French, <HI>Enfranchir,)</HI> To make Free, to Incorporate a man into any So∣ciety or Body Politic, to make one a Free De∣nizen.</P>
<P><HI>Enfranchisement, <HI>(French,)</HI></HI> Signifies the Incorporating a Man into any Society or Body Politick; For example, he that by Charter is made Denizen of <HI>England,</HI> is said to be <HI>En∣franchised;</HI> and so is he that is made a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> or other City, or Burgess of any Town Corporate; becaufe he is made parta∣ker of those Liberties that appertain to the Corporation, whereinto he is <HI>Enfranchised.</HI> So a Villain was <HI>Enfranchised,</HI> when he was made Free by his Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Englecerie, Englecherie,</HI> or <HI>Engleschyre <HI>(Engleceria)</HI></HI> Is an old abstract word, signify∣ing the being an Englishman. For example, if

<P><HI>Enquest,</HI> Fr. (Lat. <HI>Inquisitio)</HI> Is especially, taken for that <HI>Inquisition</HI> of Jurors, or by Jury, which is the most usual tryal of all Causes, both Civil and Criminal in this Realm. For in Causes Civil, after proof is made on either side, so much as each party thinks good for himself, if the doubt be in the fact, it is re∣ferred to the discretion of Twelve indifferent Men, impannelled by the Sheriff for the pur∣pose; and as they bring in their Verdict, so Judgment passeth: For the Judge saith, the Jury findes the Fact thus, then is the Law (if their Verdict do not contradict it) thus, and so we judge. As to the <HI>Enquest</HI> in Causes cri∣minal, see <HI>Jury,</HI> and see Sir <HI>Tho. Smith de Re∣pub. Angl. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 19. An <HI>Enquest</HI> is either of Office, or at the Mise of the party. <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 12.</P>
<P><HI>Entail <HI>(Feudum talliatum,</HI></HI> Fr. <HI>Entaille, i. inscisus.)</HI> Is a Substantive Abstract, signifying Fee-tail or Fee entailed; that is abridged, cur∣tailed, or limited, and tied to certain condi∣tions. See <HI>Fee</HI> and <HI>Tail.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Entendment</HI> (Fr. <HI>Entendement)</HI> Signifies as much as the true meaning, intent, or signifi∣cation of a Word, Sentence, Law, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 224. See <HI>Intendment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Enterplede</HI> (Fr. <HI>Entreplaider)</HI> Signifies to discuss or try a Point incidently falling out, before the Principal Cause can be determined. For example, Two persons being found Heirs to Land by two several Offices in one County, the King is brought in doubt, to which of them, Livery ought to be made; therefore before Livery be made to either, they must <HI>Enterplede,</HI> that is formally try between themselves, who is the right heir. <HI>Stamf.

<P><HI>Entiertie</HI> or <HI>Intiertie</HI> (From the Fr. <HI>En∣tierete, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Entireness)</HI> The whole: Contradistin∣guished in our Books to <HI>Moity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Entire Tenancy,</HI> Is contrary to <HI>Several Tenancy,</HI> and signifies a sole possession in one man, whereas the other signifies a joynt or com∣mon one in more. See <HI>Broke Several Tenancy.</HI> See <HI>New Book of Entries, verbo Entier-te∣nancy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Entrie</HI> (Fr. <HI>Entree, i. Introitus, ingnessus)</HI> Properly signifies the taking possession of Lands or Tenements. See <HI>Plowden, Assize of Fresh∣force in London, fol. 93. b.</HI> It is also used for a Writ of Possession, for which see <HI>Ingressu;</HI> and read <HI>West, pa. 2. Symbol. tit. Recoveries, sect.</HI> 2, 3. who there shews for what it lies, and for what not. Of this <HI>Britton</HI> in his 114 Chapter writes to this effect. The Writs of Entry savor much of the Right of Property. As for exam∣ple, some are to recover Customs and Services, in which are contained these two words <HI>(solet &amp; debet)</HI> as the Writs <HI>Quo Jure, Rationabilibus Di∣visis, Rationabili Estoverio,</HI> with such like. And in this Plee of <HI>Entry</HI> there are three degrees: The first is, where a Man demands Lands or Tenements of his own Seisin, after the term expired; the second is, where one demands Lands or Tenements, let by another, after the Term expired; the third, where one demands Lands or Tenements of that Tenant, who had Entry by one, to whom some Ancestor of the Plaintiff did let it for a Term now expired. According to which degrees, the Writs, for more fit remedy, are varied. And there is yet a fourth form, which is without degrees, and in case of a more remote Seisin, whereunto the other three degrees do not extend. The Writ in the second degree is called a Writ of Entry <HI>In le Per;</HI> in the third degree, a Writ of Entry <HI>In le per &amp; cui;</HI> and in the fourth form without these degrees, it is called a Writ of Entry <HI>In le post;</HI> that is, <HI>after</HI> the Disseisin, which such a one made to such a one. And if any Writ of Entry be conceived out of the Right Case, so that one form be brought for another, it is abateable.</P>
<P>In these four degrees, are comprehended all manner of Writs of Entry, which are without certainty and number. Thus far <HI>Britton,</HI> by whom you may perceive, that those words <HI>Solet &amp; debet,</HI> and those other, <HI>In le per, in le per &amp; cui,</HI> and <HI>In le Post,</HI> which we meet with many times in Books shortly and obscurely mention∣ed, signifie nothing else but divers Forms of this Writ, applied to the Case, whereupon it is brought, and each Form taking its name from the words contained in the Writ. And of this read <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 193.</P>
<P>This Writ of <HI>Entry</HI> differs from an <HI>Assize,</HI> because it lies for the most part against him, who entred lawfully, but holds against Law; where∣as an <HI>Assize</HI> lies against him that unlawfully disseised; yet sometimes a Writ of <HI>Entry</HI> lies upon an Entrusion. <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol. 233. b.</HI> See the <HI>New Book of Entries, verbo Entre Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vis, fol. 254. col.</HI> 3. There is also a Writ of <HI>En∣try</HI> in the nature of an <HI>Assize.</HI> Of this Writ, in all its degrees, see <HI>Fleta, lib. 5. cap. 34. &amp; seq.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Entrusion <HI>(Intrusio)</HI></HI> Is a violent or unlaw∣ful entrance into Lands or Tenements (void of a Possossor) by him that hath no right at all to them. <HI>Bracton, lib. 4. cap.</HI> 2. For example, a Man steps into Lands, the owner whereof lately died, and the right heir, neither by himself or others, hath as yet taken possession of them. See the difference between <HI>Abator</HI> and <HI>Intrudor,</HI> in <HI>Coke on Littl. fol.</HI> 277. Though the <HI>New Book of Entries, fol. 63. C.</HI> latines <HI>Abatement</HI> by this word <HI>Intrusionem.</HI> See <HI>A∣batement,</HI> see <HI>Disseisin,</HI> and <HI>Britton, cap. 65. En∣trusion</HI> is also taken for the Writ brought

<P><HI>Entrusion de Gard,</HI> Is a Writ, that lies, where the Infant within age, entred into his Lands, and held his Lord out. For in this Case, the Lord shall not have the Writ <HI>De Communi custodia,</HI> but this. <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 90.</P>
<P><HI>Envoice.</HI> See <HI>Invoice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Enure,</HI> Signifies to take place or effect, to be available. Example, A Release shall <HI>Enure</HI> by way of extinguishment. <HI>Littleton, cap. Re∣lease.</HI> And a Release, made to a Tenant for term of life, shall <HI>Enure</HI> to him in the Re∣version.</P>

<P><HI>Equity <HI>(Equitas)</HI></HI> Is the Correction or Qualification of the Law, generally made, in that part wherein it faileth, or is too severe. For, <HI>Ad ea quae frequentiùs accidunt jura adap∣tantur:</HI> As, where an Act of Parliament is made, That whosoever does such a thing, shall be a Felon, and suffer Death, yet if a Mad∣man, or an Infant of tender years do the same, they shall be excused. Breaking of Prison, is Felony, in the prisoner himself, by the Statute <HI>De Frangentibus Prisonam;</HI> yet if the Prison be on fire, and they within break Prison to save their lives; this shall be excused by the Law of Reason. So to save my life, I may kill another that assaults me.</P>

<P><HI>Errour <HI>(Error)</HI></HI> Signifies more specially an Error in Pleading, or in the Proces. <HI>(Broke, tit. Errour.)</HI> Whereupon, the Writ, which is brought for remedy of this over-sight, is cal∣led a <HI>Writ of Error,</HI> in Latin, <HI>De Errore Corri∣gendo,</HI> thus defined by <HI>Fitz. Nat. Er. fol. 20. A Writ of Error doth also lie to redress false Judgment given in any Court of Record, as in the Common Bench,</HI> London, <HI>or other City, having power (by the Kings Charter, or Prescription) to hold Plea of Debt or Trespass above</HI> xxs. This is borrowed from the French practice, which they call <HI>Proposition d'Erreur;</HI> whereof you may read in <HI>Gregorius de Appell. pag.</HI> 36.

Merchant ought to <HI>Exchange,</HI> or return Money beyond Sea without the Kings License.</P>
<P><HI>Escape</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Eschapper, i. Effugere)</HI> Signifies a violent or privy evasion out of some lawful restraint. For example, if the Sheriff, upon a <HI>Capias</HI> directed to him, take one, and endeavor to carry him to the Goal, and he by the way, either by violence or slight, breaks from him; this is called an <HI>Escape. Stamf. (lib. 1. cap. 26 &amp; 27. Pl. Cor.)</HI> names two kindes of <HI>Escape; voluntary</HI> and <HI>negligent. Voluntary,</HI> is when one Arrests another for Felony, or other crime, and afterward lets him go: In which <HI>Eseape,</HI> the party that permits it, is by Law guilty of the fault committed by him that escapes, be it Felony, Treason, or Trespass. <HI>Negligent Escape</HI> is, when one is Arrested, and afterward escapes against his will that arrested him, and is not pursued by fresh suit, and taken again, before the party pursuing hath lost the sight of him.

Charta, cap. 31. Fitz. Nat. Br. fol. 143. T. Escheat</HI> is also used sometimes for the place or circuit, in which the King or other Lord hath <HI>Escheats</HI> of his Tenants. <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. tract. 2. cap. 2. Pupilla ocull par. 2. cap. 22. Escheat</HI> (thirdly) is used for a Writ, which lies, where the Tenant having Estate of Fee-simple in any Lands or Tenements holden of a Superior Lord, dies seised without Heir general or special: In which case the Lord brings this Writ against him that possesseth the Lands, after the death of his Tenant, and shall thereby recover the same in lieu of his servi∣ces. <HI>Fitz.

Nat. Br. fol. 142. k.</HI> And <HI>Broke, hoc titulo. Coke lib. 2. Casu Goddard,</HI> defines an <HI>Estopel</HI> to be a bar or hindrance to one to plead the truth, and re∣strains it not to the impediment given a man by his own act onely, but by anothers also. <HI>Lib. 3. Case of Fines, fol.</HI> 88.

<P><HI>Estrepement,</HI> or <HI>Estrepament,</HI> (From the Fr. <HI>Estropier.</HI> i. <HI>mutilare,)</HI> Signifies spoil made by the Tenant for term of life upon any Lands or Woods to the prejudice of him in the Re∣version, <HI>Stat. 6. Edw. 1. ca.</HI> 13. And, it may seem by the derivation, that <HI>Estrepament</HI> is properly the unreasonable soaking, or drawing away the heart of the Land, by Plowing and Sowing it continually, without Manuring, or other good Husbandry; And yet <HI>Estropier</HI> sig∣nifying <HI>mutilare,</HI> it may no less properly be ap∣plyed to those that cut down Trees, or lop them farther then the Law allowes. It signifies also a Writ, which lies in two Cases, the one, when a Man, (having an Action depending, as a <HI>Formdon, dum fuit infra atatem, Writ of right,</HI> or such like, wherein the Demandant is not to recover Damages,) sues, to inhibit the Tenant from making wast, during the Sute. The other is for the Demandant, who is adjudged to recover Seisin of the Land in question, and be∣fore Execution sued by the Writ <HI>Habere facias possessionem,</HI> for fear of waste to be made before he can get possession, sues out this Writ. See more in <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol 60 &amp; 67. Reg. of Writs, fol.</HI> 76. And <HI>Reg. Judic. fol.</HI> 37. In an∣cient Records we often find <HI>Vastum &amp; Estrepa∣mentum facere.

And indeed, as the very first creation of this tenure grew from the love of the Lord towards his Followers; so did it bind the Tenant to <HI>Fidelity,</HI> as appears by the whole course of the <HI>Feods;</HI> and the breach thereof, is loss of the Fee. <HI>Hotoman</HI> in his <HI>Commentaries, de verbis Feudalibus,</HI> shews a <HI>Double Fealty,</HI> one <HI>general,</HI> to be performed by every Subject to his Prince; the other <HI>spe∣cial,</HI> required onely of such, as in respect of their Fee, are tied by this Oath towards their Land-lords; we may read of both in the <HI>Grand Custumary</HI> of <HI>Normandy, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fealty special</HI> is with us performed, either by Freemen or by Villains; the form of both see, <HI>Anno 17 Edw.</HI> 2. in these words, <HI>When a Fréeman shall do</HI> Fealty <HI>to his Lord, he shall hold his right hand upon a Book, and shall say thus,</HI> Hear you my Lord R. that <HI>I.

B.</HI> from this day forth, unto you shall be true and faithful, and shall ow you <HI>Fealty,</HI> for the Land that I hold of you in Villange, and shall be justified by you, in Body and Goods: So help me God, and all his Saints. <HI>See Reg. of Writs, fol. 302. a.

<P><HI>Fée <HI>(Feodum alias Feudum)</HI></HI> Is applied to all those Lands and Tenements, which we hold by perpetual right, and by an acknowledgment of any superiority to a higher Lord. Those that write of this subject, divide all Lands and Te∣nements, wherein a Man hath a perpetual estate to him, and his heirs, into <HI>Allodium</HI> and <HI>Feudum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Allodium</HI> is defined to be every Mans own Land, &amp;c. which he possesseth meerly in his own right, without acknowledgment of any service or payment of any Rent to any other, and this is a property in the highest degree.</P>
<P><HI>Feudum,</HI> is that which we hold by the bene∣fit of another, and in the name whereof we ow Service, or pay Rent, or both, to a Superior Lord. And all our Land here in <HI>England</HI> (the Crown Land, which is in the Kings own hands, in right of His Crown excepted) is in the na∣ture of <HI>Feudum,</HI> or Fee: For though many have Land by descent from their Ancestors, and others have dearly bought Land for their Money, yet is it of such nature, that it cannot come to any, either by descent or purchase, but with the burthen that was laid upon him,
<PB REF="61"/>
who had <HI>Novel Fee,</HI> or first of all received it, as a benefit from his Lord, to him, and to all such, to whom it might descend, or any way be conveyed. So that there is no Man that hath <HI>Directum Dominium, i.</HI> The very Property or Demain in any Land, but the Prince, in right of His Crown. <HI>Camd. Britan. pag.</HI> 93. For, though he that hath Fee, hath <HI>Jus perpetuum &amp; utile Dominium,</HI> yet he ows a duty for it, and therefore it is not simply his own; which thing, I take those words, we use for the expressing our deepest Rights in any Lands or Tenements, to import; for he that can say most for his estate, saith thus, <HI>I am seised of this, or that Land, or Tenement, in my Demain, as of Fee;</HI> and that is as much, as if he had said, it is my Demain or Proper Land after a sort, because it is to me and my heirs for ever, yet not sim∣ply mine, because I hold it in the nature of a benefit from another; yet the Stat. 37 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 16. useth the word <HI>(Fee)</HI> of Lands invest∣ed in the Crown, but it proceeds from an igno∣rance of the nature of the word; for <HI>Fee</HI> can∣not be without <HI>Fealty</HI> sworn to a Superior, as you may read partly in the word <HI>Fealty,</HI> but more at large in those that write <HI>De Feudis;</HI> and namely <HI>Hotoman,</HI> both in his <HI>Commentaries</HI> and <HI>Disputations;</HI> since no Man may grant, that our King or Crown oweth <HI>Fealty</HI> to any Superior, but God onely. And all that write <HI>De Feudis,</HI> hold, that <HI>Feudatarius</HI> hath not an en∣tire property in his Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Fee</HI> is divided into <HI>Fee absolute,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Fee-simple,</HI> and <HI>Fee-conditional,</HI> other∣wise termed <HI>Fee-tail. Fee-simple (Feudum sim∣plex)</HI> is that whereof we are seised <HI>To us and our heirs for ever. Fee-tail (Feudum taliatum)</HI> is that whereof we are seised, with limitation, to us, and the heirs of our Body; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which <HI>Fee-tayle</HI> is both <HI>general</HI> and <HI>special; General</HI> is, where Land is given to a Man and the heires of his body; the reason whereof is shewed by <HI>Lit∣tleton, lib. 1. ca.</HI> 2. because a Man seised of Land by such a gift, if he Marry one or more Wives, and have no issue by them, and, at length marry another by whom he hath issue, this issue shall inherit the Land. <HI>Fee-tayl speci∣al</HI> is that, where a Man and his Wife are seised of Lands to them and the heirs of their two bo∣dies; because in this case, the Wife dying without issue, and he Marrying another by whom he hath issue, this issue cannot inherit the Land, being especially given to such heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This <HI>Fee-tayl</HI> has Original from the Stat. of <HI>Westm. 2. ca.</HI> 1. Yet see <HI>Bracton, lib. 2. ca. 5. num. 3. Item quaedam absoluta &amp; larga &amp; quae∣dam stricta &amp; coarcta, sicut certis haeredibus.</HI> To whom add <HI>Plowden casu, Willion, fol.</HI> 235. For, before that Statute, all Land given to a Man and his heirs, either general or special, was accounted in the nature of <HI>Fee,</HI> and there∣fore held to be so firmly in him to whom it was given, that, any limitation notwithstanding, he might alienate it at his pleasure, <HI>Coke on Litt. fol.</HI> 19. for redress of which inconvenience the said Statute was made, whereby it is ordain'd, that if a Man give Lands in Fee, limiting the heirs to whom it shall descend, with a rever∣sion to himself or his heires for default, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that the form and true meaning of his gift shall be observed. He that hath <HI>Fee</HI> then, holdeth of another by some duty or other which is called <HI>Service.</HI></P>
<P>This word <HI>Fee</HI> is sometimes used for the compass or circuit of a Lordship or Mannor. <HI>Bracton lib. 2. ca. 5. in eadem villa &amp; de eodem Feodo.</HI> Thirdly, It is used for a perpetual right incorporeal, as, to have the keeping of Prisons in <HI>Fee.

<P><HI>Fee Farm,</HI> or <HI>Fee Ferm, <HI>(Feudi firma</HI></HI> vel <HI>feofirma,)</HI> Is, when the Lord, upon creation of the Tenancy, reserves to himself and his heirs, either the rent, for which it was before letten to Farm, or at least a fourth part of that rent. 2 <HI>Part Inst. fo.</HI> 44. and, that with∣out homage, fealty, or other services, other then are especially comprized in the Feoffment, but, by <HI>Fitzh.</HI> it seems the third part of the value may be appointed for the Rent, or the finding of a Chaplain to Sing Divine-Service, <HI>&amp;c. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 210. C. And, the Nature of it is this, That, if the Rent be behind, and unpaid for the space of two years, then the Feoffor or his heirs have Action to recover the Lands, as their Demesnes. <HI>Britton. ca. 66. num.</HI> 4. But observe out of <HI>Wests Symbol. part 1. lib. 2. Sect.</HI> 463. that the Feoffment may contain ser∣vices and sute of Court, as well as rent: And, the Author of the <HI>New Terms of Law</HI> saith, That <HI>Feeferm</HI> oweth fealty, though not expres∣sed in the Feoffment, since Fealty belongs to all kinds of Tenures.

<P><HI>Felony, <HI>Felonia,</HI></HI> (Fr. <HI>Felonnie.)</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> sayes, <HI>Ideo dicta est</HI> Felonia, <HI>quia fieri de∣bet felleo animo, lib. 4. fol. 124. b.</HI> We account any offence <HI>Felony</HI> that is in degree next <HI>Petit Treason,</HI> and compriseth divers particulars, as <HI>Murder, Theft, Killing ones self, Sodomy, Rape, Willful burning of Houses,</HI> and divers such like, which are to be gathered especially out of the Statutes, whereby many offences are daily made <HI>Felony,</HI> which were not so before. <HI>Felony</HI> is discerned from lighter offences, in that the pu∣nishment thereof is death: yet not alwayes; For <HI>petit Larceny,</HI> (which is the stealing any thing under the value of twelve pence) is <HI>Fe∣lony,</HI> as appears by <HI>Broke tit. Coron. num.</HI> 2;
<PB REF="61"/>
his reason is, because the Inditement against such a one must run with these words, <HI>Felonice cepit,</HI> yet not punished by Death, though it be loss of Goods. Other exception I know not, but that a Man may call that <HI>Felony,</HI> which is under Petit-Treason, and punished by death: Of this there are two sorts, one lighter, which, for the first time, may be relieved by <HI>Clergy,</HI> another that may not; which, may also be known by the Statutes; for, <HI>Clergy</HI> is allowed where it is not expresly taken away. Of this read <HI>Stamf. pl: Cor. lib.</HI> 1. (but many offen∣ces are made <HI>Felony</HI> by Statute since he wrote,) and <HI>Lamb. Justice of P. lib. 2. ca.</HI> 7. in a Table drawn for the purpose. <HI>Felony</HI> is also punished by loss of Lands not intailed, and Goods and Chattels, both real and personal; yet the Sta∣tutes make difference in some cases concerning Lands, as appears by 37 <HI>Hen. 8. ca. 6.

<P><HI>Fiftéenth <HI>(Decima quinta)</HI></HI> Is a Tribute or Imposition of Money laid upon any City, Bo∣rough, or other Town through the Realm, not by the Poll, or upon this or that Man, but in general upon the whole City or Town; and is so called, because it amounts to a <HI>Fifteenth part</HI> of that which the City hath been valued at of old, or to a <HI>Fifteenth part</HI> of every Mans Goods and Personal Estate, according to a reasonable valuation. This is imposed by Par∣liament, and every Town, through the Realm, knows what a <HI>Fifteenth</HI> for themselves amounts unto, because it is always the same: Whereas the <HI>Subsidy,</HI> which is raised of every particular Mans Lands or Goods, must needs be incertain, because every Mans Estate is incertain: And in that regard, the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> seems to have been a Rate anciently laid upon every Town, accord∣ing to the Land or Circuit belonging to it, whereof <HI>Camden</HI> mentions many in his <HI>Britan. viz. pag. 171.

<P><HI>Fine <HI>(Finis)</HI></HI> Hath divers uses or significa∣tions; the first and most noble is, (according to <HI>Glanvile, lib. 8. cap. 1.) Amicabilis compositio &amp; finalis concordia, ex consensu &amp; licentia Domini Regis vel ejus Justiciariorum;</HI> or a Covenant made before Justices, and entred of Record for Conveyance of Lands, Tenements, or any thing inheritable, being <HI>In esse tempore Finis;</HI> to the end, to cut off all Controversies. <HI>Et Fi∣nis dicitur Finalis Concordia, quia imponit finem litibus, &amp; est exceptio peremptoria,</HI> says <HI>Bracton, lib. 5. tract. 5. cap. 28. num.</HI> 7. See the <HI>New Book of Entries, verbo, Fines.</HI> And 27 <HI>Edw. 1. stat. 1. cap.</HI> 1. So that this <HI>Fine</HI> appears to be a Compo∣sition or <HI>Concord,</HI> acknowledged and recorded before a Competent Judge, touching some Hereditament, or thing immovable, that was in controversie between the parties to the same <HI>Concord;</HI> and that, for the better credit of the transaction, it is by imputation made in the presence of the King, because levied in his Court; and therefore it bindes Women-Co∣vert, being parties, and others whom ordinari∣ly the Law disables to transact, onely for this reason, That all presumption of deceit or evil meaning is excluded, where the King and His Court of Justice are supposed to be privy to the Act.</P>
<P>Originally the use of this <HI>Final Concord</HI> was instituted and allowed, in regard that, by the Law and ancient course of Proceedings, no Plaintiff (giving Real Security or Sureties, <HI>De clamore suo prosequendo,</HI> and being to be Fined or Amerced by the Judges, if he failed there∣in, which, as appeareth by the Records of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First, were duly Estreated and certified into the <HI>Exchequer)</HI> could agree without License of the Court: So as <HI>Fines</HI> have been anciently levied in Personal Actions, and for no greater a sum of Money then xi l. But subtilty of Wit and Reason, hath in time wrought other uses of it, <HI>viz.</HI> To cut off <HI>In∣tails;</HI> and with more certainty to pass the in∣terest or title of any Land or Tenement, though not controverted, to whom we think good, either for years or in Fee. In so much as the passing a <HI>Fine,</HI> in most Cases now, is but <HI>Mera fictio Juris,</HI> alluding to the use for which it was invented, and supposing an Action or Contro∣versie, where in truth none is, and so not one∣ly operating a present Bar, and Conclusion against the parties to the <HI>Fine,</HI> and their Heirs; but at five years end, against all others, not expresly excepted (if it be levied upon good consideration and without Covin) as Women∣covert, Persons under Twenty one years, Pri∣soners, or such as are out of the Realm, at the time of its acknowledging. Touching which, see the Statutes <HI>Anno 1 Rich. 3. cap. 7.—4 H. 7. cap. 14.—32 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 36. and 31 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>This <HI>Fine</HI> hath in it <HI>five</HI> essential Parts, 1. The <HI>Original Writ</HI> taken out against the Cog∣nizor. 2. The Kings License giving the par∣ties liberty to accord, for which he hath a Fine, called the <HI>Kings Silver,</HI> being accounted part of the Crowns Revenue. 3. The <HI>Concord</HI> it self, which begins thus, <HI>Et est Concordia talis, &amp;c.</HI> 4. The note of the <HI>Fine,</HI> which is an ab∣stract of the <HI>Original Concord,</HI> beginning thus. <HI>Sc. Inter R. querentem, &amp; S. &amp; T. uxorem ejus deforcientes, &amp;c.</HI> (where in stead of <HI>Deforcien∣tes,</HI> anciently <HI>Impedientes</HI> was used) 5. The foot of the <HI>Fine (Haec est Finalis Concordia facta in Curia Domini Regis apud Westm, a die Poschae in Quindecim dies, Anno &amp;c.)</HI> includes all, containing the day, year, and place, and be∣fore what Justice the Concord was made. <HI>Coke, vol. 6.

<P>This <HI>Fine</HI> is either <HI>single</HI> or <HI>double;</HI> a <HI>Single fins</HI> is that by which nothing is granted or ren∣dred back again by the Cognizees to the Cogni∣zors, or any of them. A <HI>Double fine</HI> contains a grant, and render back, either of some Rent, common, or other thing out of the Land, or of the Land it self, to all or some of the Cogni∣zors for some Estate, limiting thereby many times Remainders to strangers, not named in
<PB REF="63"/>
the Writ of Covenant; and a <HI>Fine</HI> is sometimes called a <HI>double fine,</HI> when the Lands do lie in several Counties. Again, a <HI>Fine</HI> is in its effect, divided into a <HI>Fine executed,</HI> and a <HI>Fine execu∣tory;</HI> a <HI>Fine executed</HI> is such, as of its own force gives a present possession (at least in Law) to the Conizec, so that he needs no Writ of <HI>Habere facias Seizinam,</HI> for Execution of the same; but may enter, of which sort is a Fine <HI>Sur cognizance de droit come ceo que il ad de son done,</HI> that is, upon acknowledgment, that the thing mentioned in the <HI>Concord</HI> is, <HI>Jus ipsius cogniza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, ut illa quae idem habet de dono Cognitoris. West, sect. 51. K.</HI> The reason is, be∣cause this <HI>Fine</HI> passeth by way of Release of that thing, which the Conizee hath already (at least by supposition) by vertue of a former gift of the Conizor. <HI>Coke, lib. 3. Case of Fines, fol. 89. b.</HI> Which is, in very Deed, the surest <HI>Fine</HI> of all. <HI>Fines Executory,</HI> are such as of their own force, do not execute the possession in the Cognizees, as <HI>Fines, Sur cognizance de droit tantum, Fines sur done,</HI> Grant, Release, Con∣firmation, or Render. For, if such <HI>Fines</HI> are not levied, or such render made to those who are in possession at the time of the Fines levied, the Conizees must needs sue out Writs of <HI>Habere facias seisinam,</HI> according to their seve∣ral Cases, for obtaining their possessions, ex∣cept at the levying such <HI>Executory fines,</HI> the parties to whom the Estate is limited, be in possession of the Lands passed thereby: For in this Case such <HI>Fines</HI> do enure by way of extin∣guishment of Right, not altering the Estate or Possession of the Cognizee, but perhaps better∣ing it. <HI>West Symbol. sect.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>Touching the form of these <HI>Fines,</HI> it is to be considered, upon what Writ or Action the <HI>Concord</HI> is to be made, and that is most com∣monly, upon a Writ of Covenant, and then there must first pass a pair of Indentures be∣tween the Cognizor and Cognizee, whereby the Cognizor Covenants with the Cognizee, to pass a <HI>Fine</HI> to him, of such and such things, by a day limited: As these Indentures are first in this proceeding, so are they said to lead the <HI>Fine.</HI> Upon this Covenant, the <HI>Writ of Cove∣nant</HI> is brought by the Cognizee against the Cognizo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who thereupon yields to pass the <HI>Fine</HI> before the Judge, and so, the Acknow∣ledgment being Recorded, the Cognizor and his Heirs are presently concluded, and all stran∣gers (not excepted) after five years passed. If the Writ, whereon the <HI>Fine</HI> is grounded, be not a Writ of Covenant, but of <HI>Warrantia Chartae,</HI> or a Writ of Right, or of Mesn, or of Customs and Services (for of all these <HI>Fines</HI> may also be founded, <HI>West, sect.</HI> 23.) then this Form is observed; the Writ is served upon the party that is to acknowledge the <HI>Fine,</HI> and then he appearing, doth accordingly. See <HI>Dyer, fol. 179. num.</HI> 46.</P>
<P><HI>Fines</HI> are now onely levied in the Court of <HI>Common Pleas</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in regard of the solemnity thereof, ordained by the Statute of 18 <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. Before which time they were some∣times levied in the County Courts, Court Barons, and in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> as may be seen in Mr. <HI>Dugdales Origines Juridiciales &amp; alibi.</HI></P>
<P>This word <HI>Fine</HI> sometimes signifies a sum of Money, paid for an income to Lands or Tene∣ments let by Lease, anciently called <HI>Gersuma,</HI> sometimes an amends, pecuniary punishment, or recompence upon an offence committed against the King, and his Laws, or a Lord of a Mannor. In which case a Man is said <HI>Facere Finem de transgressione cum Rege, &amp;c. Reg.

But in all these diversities of Uses, it hath but one significa∣tion, and that is a <HI>Final conclusion</HI> or end of differences between parties. And in this last sence, wherein it is used for the ending and remission of an Offence, <HI>Bracton</HI> hath it <HI>(lib. 2. cap. 15. num.</HI> 8.) speaking of a <HI>Common Fine,</HI> that the County pays to the King, for false Judgments, or other Trespasses, which is to be Assessed by the Justices in Eyr before their de∣parture, by the Oath of Knights, and other good men, upon such as ought to pay it; with whom agrees the Statute 3 <HI>Edw. 1. cap.</HI> 18.

For preservation and continuance of which place, with the Vert and Venison, there are certain particular Laws, Priviledges, and Officers, belonging onely thereto.</HI></P>
<P>Its properties are these: First, A <HI>Forest,</HI> as it is truly and strictly taken, cannot be in the hands of any, but the King; because none hath power to grant Commission to be a Justice in Eyre of the Forest, but the King. (Yet the Abbot of <HI>Whitby</HI> had a Forest by Grant of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, and King <HI>John,</HI> with all Officers incident thereto. 4 <HI>Inst. fol. 305. &amp;</HI> 314.) The second property is the Courts, as the <HI>Justice Seat,</HI> every three years; the <HI>Swain∣mote</HI> thrice every year, and the <HI>Attachment,</HI> once every forty days. The third, may be the Officers belonging to it, for preservation of the Vert and Venison: As first, the <HI>Justices</HI> of the Forest, the <HI>Warden</HI> or Keeper, the <HI>Verderers,</HI> the <HI>Foresters, Agistors, Regarders, Bailiffs, Bedels,</HI> and such like, which see in their places. See <HI>Manwood, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> cap. 1. num. 4 &amp;</HI> 5. But the most especial Court of a Forest, is the <HI>Swain-mote,</HI> which is no less incident to it, then the Court of <HI>Pye-Powders</HI> to a Fair. If this fail, then is there nothing of a <HI>Forest</HI> remaining, but it is turned into the nature of a <HI>Chace.</HI> There are reckoned to be in <HI>England</HI> Sixty eight <HI>Forests.</HI> For the ascertaining the Meets and Bounds of <HI>Forests.</HI> See <HI>Anno 17 Car. 1. cap.</HI> 16.</P>

<P><HI>Formdon, <HI>(Breve de forma donationis,)</HI></HI> Is a Writ that lies for him, who has right to any Lands or Tenements, by vertue of any <HI>Intail,</HI> growing from the Stat. of <HI>Westm. 2. ca.</HI> 1.

<P><HI>Fitz. Nat.

<P><HI>Frank-fée <HI>(Feudum Liberum)</HI></HI> Is (by <HI>Broke, tit.

See <HI>Reg. of Writs, fol. 12. a.</HI> which says, that is <HI>Frank-fee</HI> which a Man holds at the Common Law to him and his Heirs, and not by such Service as is required in Ancient Demesn, according to the custom of the Man∣nor. And that the Lands which were said to be in the hands of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, at the making of <HI>Domesday</HI> Book, is Ancient De∣mesn, and all the rest <HI>Frank-fee;</HI> wherewith <HI>Fitzherbert</HI> agrees <HI>(Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 161.) So that all the Lands in the Realm by this Rule, are either <HI>Ancient Demesn</HI> or <HI>Frank-fee.</HI> Another defines <HI>Frank-fee</HI> to be a Tenure in Fee-simple of Lands, pleadable at the Common Law, and not in Ancient Demesn. <HI>Feudum francum est, pro quo nullum servitium praestatur Domino,</HI> says <HI>Fachineus, lib. 7. cap.</HI> 39.</P>
<P><HI>Frank-ferm <HI>(Firma Libera)</HI></HI> Is Land or Tenement wherein the nature of Fee is changed by Feosment out of Knights-service, for cer∣tain yearly services; and whence neither Homage, Wardship, Marriage, nor Relief may be demanded, nor any other Service not contained in the Feofment. <HI>Britton, cap. 66. num.</HI> 3.

<P><HI>Frank-Law <HI>(Libera Lex)</HI></HI> Is the benefit of the Free and Common Law of the Land. He that for any offence, as Conspiracy, &amp;c. loseth his <HI>Franc-Law,</HI> is said to fall into these mischeifs; first, That he may never be em∣panell'd upon any Jury or Assise, or otherwise used in testifying any truth. Next, if he have any thing to do in the Kings Court, he must not approach it in person, but appoint his At∣turney. Thirdly, his Lands, Goods, and Chattels, must be seised into the Kings hands, and his Lands must be Estreaped, his Trees rooted up, and his Body committed to prison.

<P><HI>Frank-pledge</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Frank, i. Liber &amp; Pleige, i. Fidejussor)</HI> Signifies a Pledge or Surety for Freemen. The ancient custom of <HI>England</HI> for preservation of the Publick Peace, was, that every free-born Man, at fourteen years of age (Religious persons, Clerks, Knights, and their eldest Sons excepted) should finde Surety for his Truth, towards the King and his Subjects, or else be kept in Pri∣son; whereupon a certain number of Neigh∣bors became customably bound one for another, to see each Man of their <HI>Pledge</HI> forth coming at all times, or to answer the Transgression committed by any gone away. So that whoever offended, it was forthwith enquired in what <HI>Pledge</HI> he was, and then those of that <HI>Pledge,</HI> either brought him forth within thirty one days to his answer, or satisfied for his offence. This was called <HI>Frank-pledge,</HI> and the circuit there∣of <HI>Decenna;</HI> because it commonly consisted of ten housholds; and every particular person thus mutually bound for himself, and his Neigh∣bors, was called <HI>Decennier;</HI> because he was of one <HI>Decenna</HI> or other. This custom was so kept, that the Sheriffs, at every County Court, did from time to time take the Oaths of young ones, as they grew to Fourteen years of age, and see, that they were setled in one <HI>Dozein,</HI> or another; whereupon this Branch of the Sheriffs Authority was called <HI>Visus Franci-plegii,</HI> View of Frank-pledge. See the Statute for <HI>View of Frank-pledge, Anno 18 Edw.</HI> 2. See <HI>Decen∣nier, Leet, View of Frank-pledge,</HI> and <HI>Friborgh.</HI> What Articles were wont to be enquired of in this Court, see in <HI>Horns Mirror, lib. 1. cap.

<P><HI>Frée-bench <HI>(Franc-bank, Francus Bancus, i.

<P><HI>Garnishment,</HI> (Fr. <HI>Garnement,)</HI> Signifies a warning given to one for his appearance; and that for the better furnishing the Cause and Court. For example, one is sued for the deti∣nue of certain Charters, and says, They were deliver'd to him, not onely by the Plaintiff, but by <HI>J. S.</HI> also, and therefore prayes, that <HI>J. S.</HI> may be warned to plead with the Plaintiff, whether the conditions are performed or no; and, in this petition he is said to pray <HI>Garnish∣ment.

S.</HI> to provide himself of a defence, or else a furnishing the Court with all parties to the action, whereby it may throughly determine the Cause. <HI>Brit∣ton (cap.</HI> 28.) says, Contracts are some na∣ked and <HI>sans garnement,</HI> and some furnished, or (to use the literal signification of his word) apparelled, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Howbeit <HI>Garnishment</HI> is gene∣rally used for a warning; As in <HI>Kitchin, fol. 6.

<P><HI>Garter,</HI> (Fr. <HI>Jartier.</HI> i. <HI>Periscelis, fas∣cia poplitaria,)</HI> Signifies, both in divers Statutes and otherwise, one special <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>r,</HI> be∣ing the Ensign of a great and noble Socie∣ty of Knights, called Knights of the <HI>Garter.</HI> This high Order (as appears by <HI>Camd. pa.</HI> 211.) was instituted by that famous King <HI>Edward the Third,</HI> upon good success in a Skirmish, wherein the Kings Garter, (the time or occasion not mentioned,) was used as a token. <HI>Pol. Virgil</HI> casts in a suspition of another original; but, his grounds, by his own confession, grew from the vulgar opinion, however, it runs thus; The said King, after he had obtained divers great Victories, King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being both prisoners in the Tower of <HI>London</HI> at one time, King <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Castile,</HI> the Bastard, expulsed, and Don <HI>Pedro</HI> restored by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> did, upon no weightier occasion, first institute this Order in <HI>Anno 1350, viz.</HI> He dancing with the Queen, and other Ladies of the Court, took up a <HI>Garter</HI> that hapned to fall from one of them, whereat some of the Lords smiling, the King said, That ere long he would make that <HI>Garter</HI> to be of high reputation, and shortly after instituted this Order of the <HI>Blew Garter,</HI> which every Companion of the Order is bound to wear dai∣ly, richly adorned with Gold and Precious Stones, and having these words wrought upon it, <HI>HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENCE;</HI> which is thus interpreted, <HI>Evil be to him, that evil thinks;</HI> or rather thus, <HI>Shame take him that thinks evil.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Fern,</HI> in his <HI>Glory of Generosity, fol.</HI> 120. agrees with <HI>Camden,</HI> and sets down the victories, whence this Order was occasion'd; whatsoever cause of beginning it had, the Or∣der is inferior to none in the World, in Honor or Antiquity, consisting of 26 Martial and He∣roical Nobles, whereof the <HI>King of England</HI> is the Chief, and the rest are either Nobles of the Realm, or Princes of other Countries, friends and confederates with this Nation; the Ho∣nour being such, as Emperours, and Kings of other Nations have desired, and thankfully ac∣cepted, it being long before the order of St. <HI>Michael</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Golden Fleece</HI> in <HI>Bur∣gundy,</HI> or the <HI>Anunciada</HI> in <HI>Savoy.</HI> The Ce∣remonies of the Chapter, proceeding to Electi∣on, the Investitures and Robes, the Installati∣on, Vow, with such other observations see in <HI>Segars Honor militar &amp; civil, lib. 2. ca. 9. fol.</HI> 65.

ancient British word; For, <HI>Gardd</HI> in that lan∣guage signifies a Garden, the <HI>dd</HI> being liquefy'd in the pronunciation like <HI>th.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Garthman, <HI>Anno 17 Rich. 2. ca.</HI></HI> 9. <HI>It is ordained, that no Fisher, nor</HI> Garthman, <HI>shall use any Nets or Engins to destroy the fry of fish,</HI> &amp;c. Whereby it seems to signifie one that keeps or owns an open Wear, where Fish are caught. It may haply be derived from the <HI>Scottish</HI> word <HI>Gart,</HI> which signifies forced or compelled, because the Fish are for∣ced by the Wear to pass in at a loop, where they are caught.</P>
<P><HI>Gavel,</HI> (Sax. gafel,) Tribute, Toll, Cu∣stom; yearly Rent, Payment or Revenue; Of which we had of old several kinds paid by Te∣nants to their Landlords; As <HI>Gavel-Corn, Ga∣vel-malt, Oate-gavel, Gavel-fodder;</HI> As you may read in Mr. <HI>Fabian Philip's</HI> Book, Entitu∣led, <HI>Mistaken Recompence, pa. 39 &amp;</HI> 40.</P>
<P><HI>Gavelet,</HI> Is a special and ancient kind of <HI>Cessavit</HI> used in <HI>Kent,</HI> where the Custom of <HI>Ga∣velkind</HI> continues; whereby the Tenant shall for∣feit his Lands and Tenements to the Lord; if he withdraw from him his due Rents and Ser∣vices; after this manner.—The Lord must seek, by the award of his Court, from three weeks to three weeks, to fin I some distress upon the Tenement, until the fourth Court, alwayes with Witnesses; and, if in that time he can find none, then at the fourth Court let it be awarded, that he take the Tenement into his hand, in name of a Distress, and keep it a Year and a day without Manuring; within which time, if the Tenant pay his Arrears, and make reasonable amends for the withholding, let him have and enjoy his Tenement as before; and, if he come not before the year and day be past, let the Lord go to the next County-Court with his Witness of what past at his own Court, and pronounce there this Process to have fur∣ther Witnesses; and then, by the award of his own Court, he shall enter and Manure the Te∣nement as his own: And, if the Tenant will afterwards re-have it, and hold it as he did be∣fore, let him make agreement with the Lord, according to this old saying,
<Q><P><HI>Neghesith selde &amp; neghesith geld, &amp; v l. for his Were, er he become healder.</HI> i.</P>

<P><HI>Homage,</HI> (Fr.) Is derived from <HI>Homo,</HI> and is called <HI>Homage,</HI> because when the Tenant does this service, he says, <HI>I become your Man;</HI> It is also called <HI>Manhood,</HI> as the <HI>Manhood</HI> of his Tenant and the <HI>Homage</HI> of his Tenant is all one. <HI>Coke on Litt. fo.</HI> 64. In the Original Grants of Lands and Tenements by way of Fee, the Lord did not onely tye his Tenants to certain Services, but also took a submission with Promise and Oath to be true and loyal to him, as their Lord and Benefactor. This sub∣mission is called <HI>Homage,</HI> the form whereof you have in 17 <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. Stat. 2. in these words. <HI>When a freeman shall do Homage to his Lord, of whom he holds in chief, he shall hold his hands together between the hands of his Lord, and shall say thus,</HI> I become your man from this day forth for life, for mem∣ber and for worldly honour, and shall owe you my faith, for the Land I hold of you, sa∣ving the Faith that I owe unto our Soveraign Lord the King, and to mine other Lords. And in this manner the Lord of the Fee, for which <HI>Homage</HI> is due, takes <HI>Homage</HI> of every Tenant, as he comes to the Land or Fee. <HI>Glanv. lib. 9. ca.</HI> 1. except women, who perform not <HI>Homage,</HI> but by their Husbands (yet <HI>Fitz.</HI> in his <HI>Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 157. sayes the contrary) because <HI>Ho∣mage</HI> specially relates to service in War. He says also, That Consecrated Bishops do no <HI>Homage,</HI> but onely fealty; the reason may be all one; yet the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> does <HI>Homage</HI> on his knees to our Kings at their Co∣ronation; and, I have read, that the Bishop of the Isle of <HI>Man</HI> is Homager to the Earl of <HI>Der∣by. Fulbec</HI> reconciles this, <HI>fol.</HI> 20. in these words; By our Law a Religious Man may do <HI>Homage,</HI> but may not say to his Lord, <HI>Ego de∣venio homo vester,</HI> because he has professed him∣self
<PB REF="75"/>

<P><HI>Homage</HI> is either new with the Fee, or <HI>ance∣strel. Homage</HI> is also used for the Jury in a Court Baron, because it commonly consists of such as owe <HI>Homage</HI> to the Lord of the Fee. This <HI>Homage</HI> is used in other Countreys as well as ours, and was wont to be called <HI>Hominium.</HI> See <HI>Hotoman de verbis feud. verbo</HI> Homo.</P>
<P><HI>Homage auncestrel,</HI> Is, where a Tenant holds his Land of his Lord by <HI>Homage,</HI> and the same Tenant and his <HI>Ancestors,</HI> (whose heir he is) have holden the same Land of the same Lord and his Ancestors, whose heir the Lord is, time out of memory of man, by <HI>Homage,</HI> and have done them <HI>Homage;</HI> such service draws to it warrantry from the Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus <HI>Littleton. In this example here put</HI> (says Sir <HI>Edward Coke) There must be a double prescripti∣on, both in the blood of the Lord and of the Te∣nant; and therefore, I think there is little or no land at all at this day holden by</HI> Homage ance∣strel: Yet, I have been credibly informed, that in the Mannor of <HI>Whitney,</HI> in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> whose Lord is of the same name, and the fa∣mily has been seated and continued there for many ages; is one <HI>West</HI> a Tenant, who can perfectly prescribe to hold his Land of <HI>Tho.

<P><HI>Homicide, <HI>(Homicidium) Is the slaying of a Man, and it is divided into voluntary</HI></HI> and <HI>casual.

<P><HI>Hundred, <HI>(Hundredum, Centuria,)</HI></HI> Is a part of a Shire so called; either because at first there were an hundred Towns and Villages in each Hundred, or because they did find the King 100 able Men for his Warrs. These were first ordain'd by King <HI>Alfred,</HI> the 29th King of the West-<HI>Saxons: Aluredus Rex,</HI> (sayes <HI>Lambert, verbo,</HI> Centuria) <HI>ubi cum</HI> Gu∣thruno <HI>daco foedus inierat, prudentissimum illud olim a Jethrone Moisi datum secutus consilium, Angliam primus in Satrapias, Centurias &amp; de∣curias, partitus est.

This dividing Counties into Hundreds, for better Government, King <HI>Alfred</HI> brought from <HI>Ger∣many;</HI> For there <HI>Centa</HI> or <HI>Centena</HI> is a juris∣diction over a hundred Towns. This is the original of <HI>Hundreds,</HI> which still retain the name, but their Jurisdiction is devolved to the County Court, some few excepted, which have been by priviledge annexed to the Crown, or granted to some great Subject, and so remain still in the nature of a Franchise. This has been ever since the Stat. 14 <HI>Edw. 3. Stat. 1. c.</HI> 9. whereby these <HI>Hundred Courts,</HI> formerly Farmed out by the Sheriff to other Men, were all, or the most part reduced to the County Court, and so remain at present. So, that where you read now of any <HI>Hundred Courts,</HI> you must know they are several Franchises, wherein the Sheriff has not to do by his ordi∣nary Authority, except they of the <HI>Hundred</HI> refuse to do their Office.

So that where it is said, all things are tryable by <HI>Battel</HI> or <HI>Assise: Assise</HI> in this place, is taken for a <HI>Iury,</HI> or Enquest, empanelled upon any Cause in a Court where this kinde of Tryal is used. This <HI>Iury,</HI> though it pertain to most Courts of the Common Law, yet is it most notorious in the half-yearly Courts of the <HI>Justices Itinerants,</HI> or of the <HI>Great Assises,</HI> and in the Quarter Sessi∣ons, where it is usually called a <HI>Iury;</HI> and that in Civil Causes; whereas in other Courts it is oftener termed an <HI>Enquest,</HI> and in the Court Baron, a <HI>Iury</HI> of the <HI>Homage.</HI> In the General Assise, there are usually many <HI>Iuries,</HI> because there are many Causes, both Civil and Criminal, commonly to be tryed, whereof one is called the <HI>Grand Iury,</HI> or <HI>Great Enquest,</HI> and the rest <HI>Petit Iuries,</HI> whereof it seems there should be one for every Hundred. <HI>Lamb. Eiren. lib. 4. cap. 3. pag.</HI> 384.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Iury</HI> consists ordinarily of Twen∣ty four grave and substantial Gentlemen, or some of them of the better sort of Yeomen, chosen indifferently out of the whole County by the Sheriff, to consider of all Bills of In∣dictment preferred to the Court, which they do either approve, by writing upon them <HI>Billa Vera,</HI> or disallow, by writing <HI>Ignoramus;</HI> such as they approve, or <HI>finde,</HI> as they term it, if they touch life and death, are farther referred to another <HI>Iury</HI> to be considered of; because the Case is of such importance; but others of less moment in Trespass, or for misdemeanors, are, upon their allowance, without more ado, fined by the Bench, except the party Traverse the Indictment, or challenge it for insufficien∣cy; or remove the Cause to a higher Court by <HI>Certiorari;</HI> in which two former Cases it is re∣ferred to another <HI>Iury,</HI> and in the later, trans∣mitted to the higher Court. <HI>Lamb. Eiren. lib. 4. cap.</HI> 7. And presently upon the allowance of this Bill by the <HI>Grand Enquest,</HI> a Man is said to be <HI>indicted;</HI> such as they disallow, are de∣livered to the Bench, by whom they are forth∣with cancelled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Petit Jury</HI> in Criminal Causes, consists of Twelve Men, at least, and being impanel∣led, do bring in their Verdict, either <HI>guilty,</HI> or <HI>not guilty;</HI> whereupon, the Prisoner, if he be found guilty, is said to be <HI>Convict,</HI> and ac∣cordingly afterward receives his Judgment, and
<PB REF="81"/>
Condemnation, or otherwise is acquitted. Those that pass upon Civil Causes real, are so many, as can conveniently be had, of the same Hundred, where the Land or Tenement in question lies, or four, at the least: And they, upon due examination of the Matter, bring in their Verdict, either for the Demandant or Tenant. Of this, see <HI>Fortescu, cap.</HI> 25, 26, 27. According to which, Judgment passeth after∣wards in the Court, where the Cause first began; and the reason hereof is, because these Justices of Assise are in this Case, for the ease of the Countrey; onely to take the Verdict of the <HI>Jury,</HI> by vertue of the Writ called <HI>Nisi Prius,</HI> and so return it to the Court, where the Cause is depending.

<P><HI>Justice <HI>(Justiciarius)</HI></HI> Signifies him that is deputed by the King to administer <HI>justice,</HI> and do right by way of Judgment: The reason why he is called <HI>Justice,</HI> and not <HI>Judex,</HI> is; because, in ancient time, the Latin word for him was <HI>Justicia,</HI> and not <HI>Justiciarius,</HI> as ap∣pears by <HI>Glanvil, lib. 2. cap.</HI> 6. and <HI>Hoveden, fol. 413. a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Secondly, Because they have their Authority by deputation, as Delegates to the King, and not <HI>Jure Magistratus;</HI> and there∣fore cannot depute others in their stead; the <HI>Justice</HI> of the Forest onely excepted, who hath that liberty especially given him by the Statute 32 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 35. For the Chancellor, Marshal, Admiral, and such like are not called <HI>Justici∣arii,</HI> but <HI>Judices.</HI> Of these <HI>Justices</HI> we have divers sorts in <HI>England,</HI> the manner of their Creation with other Appurtenances read in <HI>Fortescu, cap.</HI> 51. These in <HI>Mag. Char. cap.</HI> 12. and other Statutes are called <HI>Justicers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cheif Justice of the Kings Bench <HI>(Ca∣pitalis Justicia vel Iusticiarius Banci Regii)</HI></HI> Hath the Title of <HI>Lord,</HI> whilest he enjoys his Office, and is called <HI>Capitalis Iusticiarius,</HI> be∣cause he is the <HI>cheif</HI> of the rest. His Office is specially to hear, and determine all Pleas of the Crown, that is, such as concern offences, committed against the Crown, Dignity, and Peace of the King, as <HI>Treasons, Felonies, May∣hems,</HI> and such like, which you may see in <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. tract. 2. per totum.</HI> And in <HI>Stanf. Pleas of the Crown.</HI> He also, with his assist∣ants, hears all Personal Actions, incident to his Jurisdiction. See Sir <HI>Edw. Cokes 4 Inst. fol.</HI> 74. who says, The <HI>Cheif Iustice</HI> of this Court was anciently created by Letters Patent, but now by Writ, in this form.</P>

<P><HI>Cheif Justice of the Common Pleas,</HI> Hath also the Title of <HI>Lord,</HI> whilest he enjoys his Office, and is called <HI>Dominus Iusticiarius Communium Placitorum,</HI> who, with his Assistants, did originally, and do yet hear and determine all Causes at the Common Law, that is, all Civil Causes, as well personal as real, between common persons; wherefore it was called <HI>The Court of Common Pleas,</HI> in distinction from <HI>The Pleas of the Crown,</HI> or the Kings Pleas, which are special and appertaining to him onely. This Court was appointed to be in a setled place, and not as other Courts, to follow or attend the Kings Court or Palace, as appears by the Stat. 9 <HI>Hon. 3. cap.</HI> 11.

<P><HI>Justice of the Forest <HI>(Iusticiarius Forestae)</HI></HI> Is also a <HI>Lord</HI> by his Office, and hath the hearing and determining all offences within the <HI>Forest,</HI> committed against Venison or Vert; of these
<PB REF="81"/>
there are two, whereof the one hath Juris∣diction over all the <HI>Foresta</HI> on this side <HI>Trent,</HI> the other over all beyond. The cheifest point of their Jurisdiction consists in the <HI>Articles</HI> of the Kings Charter, called <HI>Charta de Foresta,</HI> made 9 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. See <HI>Cam. Britan. pag.</HI> 214. The Court, where this <HI>Iustice</HI> sits, is called the <HI>Iustice Seat of the Forest,</HI> held once every three years. See <HI>Manwood, par. 1. pag. 121. &amp;</HI> 154. He is also called <HI>Iustice in Eyre</HI> of the <HI>Forest.</HI> This is the onely <HI>Iustice</HI> that may appoint a De∣puty by Stat. 32 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 35.</P>
<P><HI>Justice of Assise <HI>(Iusticiarii ad capiendas Assisas)</HI></HI> Are such as were wont by special Commission to be sent (as occasion was offered) into this or that County to take <HI>Assises,</HI> for the ease of the people. And it seemes the <HI>Iustices</HI> of the <HI>Common Pleas</HI> had no power to take <HI>Assises,</HI> until the Statute of 8 <HI>Rich. 2. cap.</HI> 2. for by that, they are enabled thereto, and to deliver Goals. And the <HI>Iustices</HI> of the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> have by that Statute such power affirmed unto them, as they had One hundred years before. Of later years it is come to pass, that these Commissions, <HI>Ad capiendas Assisas,</HI> are executed in the <HI>Lent;</HI> and long Vacation, when the <HI>Iustices</HI> and Lawyers are most at lea∣sure to attend them. Hence the matters, ac∣customed to be heard by more general Commis∣sion of <HI>Iustices in Eyre,</HI> are heard all at one time, with the <HI>Assises,</HI> which was not so of old, as appears by <HI>Bracton, lib. 3. cap. 7. num.</HI> 2. Yet no <HI>Iustice</HI> of either <HI>Bench,</HI> nor any other, may be <HI>Iustice of Assise</HI> in his own Countrey. <HI>Anno 8 Rich. 2. cap.</HI> 2. and 33 <HI>Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 24. And these, who are in one word called <HI>Iustices of Assise,</HI> and twice every year go the circuit by two and two through all <HI>England,</HI> have one Commission to take <HI>Assises,</HI> another to deliver <HI>Goals,</HI> another of <HI>Oyer and Terminer, &amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Assise</HI> and <HI>Cromp. Iuris. fol.</HI> 210. That <HI>Iustices of Assise,</HI> and <HI>Iustices in Eyre,</HI> did anciently differ, appears <HI>Anno 27 Edw. 3. cap.</HI> 5. And that <HI>Iustices of Assise,</HI> and <HI>Iustices of Goal De∣livery,</HI> were divers, is evident by <HI>Anno 4 Ed. 3. cap.</HI> 3. The Oath taken by <HI>Iustices of Assise,</HI> is all one with that taken by the <HI>Iustices</HI> of the <HI>Kings Bench. Old Abridgment of Statutes, titulo, Sacramentum Iusticiariorum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Justices of Oyer and Terminer <HI>(Justi∣ciarii ad audiendum &amp; terminandum)</HI></HI> were <HI>Justices,</HI> Deputed upon some special or extra∣ordinary occasion, to hear and determine some particular Causes. <HI>Fitz.</HI> (in his <HI>Nat. Br.)</HI> saith, The Commission of <HI>Oyer and Terminer</HI> is direct∣ed to certain persons, upon any Insurrection, heinous Demeanor or Trespass committed. And, because the occasion of granting this Commis∣sion should be maturely weighed, it is provided by the Statute 2 <HI>Edw. 3. cap.</HI> 2. That no such Commission ought to be granted, but that they shall be dispatched before the <HI>Iustices</HI> of the one Bench, or the other, or <HI>Iustices Errants,</HI> except for horrible Trespasses, and that by special favor of the King. The Form of this Commission, see in <HI>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 110.</P>
<P><HI>Justices in Eyre <HI>(Justiciarii itinerantes, alias Errantes, alias Perlustrantes)</HI></HI> are so termed of the old French word <HI>Erre, i. iter;</HI> as <HI>a grand Erre, i. magnis itineribus,</HI> proverbial∣ly spoken. These, in ancient time, were sent with Commission into divers Counties, to hear such Causes specially, as were termed the Pleas of the Crown; and that for the ease of the Subject, who must else have been hurried to the Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> according to their several Jurisdictions.; if the Cause were too high for the County Court. These Justices (ac∣cording to <HI>Gwin,</HI> in his Preface to his <HI>Reading)</HI> were anciently sent but once in seven years, with whom <HI>Horn</HI> (in his <HI>Mirror of Justices)</HI> seemes to agree, <HI>Lib. 2. cap.

These probably, in ancient time, were sent into the Counties upon this several occasion: But afterwards <HI>Iustices of Assise</HI> had this in Commission also. <HI>Anno 4 Edw. 3. cap.</HI> 3.

<P><HI>Justices of Nisi Prius,</HI> Are now all one with <HI>Iustices of Assises:</HI> For it is a common Adjournment of a Cause in the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> to put it off to such a day, <HI>Nisi prius Iusticiarii venerint ad eas partes ad capiendas Assisas.</HI> Up∣on which Clause of Adjournment, they are cal∣led <HI>Iustices of Nisi Prius,</HI> as well as <HI>Iustices of Assises,</HI> by reason of the Writ or Action they have to deal in. Their Commission you may see in <HI>Cromp. Iuris. fol.</HI> 204. Yet he makes this difference between them, because <HI>Iustices of Assise</HI> have power to give Judgment in a Cause, and <HI>Iustices of Nisi Prius</HI> onely to take the
<PB REF="82"/>
Verdict. But in the nature of both their Fun∣ctions, this seems to be the greatest difference, that <HI>Iustices of Nisi Prius</HI> have Jurisdiction in Causes Personal, as well as Real; whereas <HI>Iustices of Assise,</HI> in strict acception, deal onely in the Possessory Writs, called <HI>Assises.

<P><HI>Latitat,</HI> Is the name of a Writ whereby all Men in Personal Actions are called original∣ly to the <HI>Kings Bench. Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 78. which hath this name, upon a supposition, commonly untrue, that the Defendant doth <HI>lurk and lie hid:</HI> For <HI>Latitare est se maliciose occultare animo fraudandi creditores.</HI> The true original of this Writ, is this: In ancient time whilest the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> was moveable, the Custom was, when any Man was to be sued, to send forth a Writ, to the Sheriff of the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> where the Court was Resident, called a <HI>Bill of Middlesex</HI> to take him; where∣upon the Sheriff returned <HI>Non est inventùs in Baliva nostra, &amp;c.</HI> Then was there a second Writ sued forth, that had these words,—<HI>Cum Testatum est quod Latitat, &amp;c.</HI> And thereby the Sheriff willed to attach him in any other place, where he might be found: And when the Tri∣bunal of the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> came to be setled at <HI>Westminster,</HI> the former course of Writ was kept for a long time, first sending to the Sheriff of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> to Summon the Party; and if he could not be found there, then to apprehend him wheresoever: But afterwards, by the con∣trivance of Clerks, and upon a pretence of Expedition of Justice, it was at last devised to put both these Writs into one, and so to at∣tach the party complained of, upon a Supposal or Fiction, that he was not within the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> but lurking elswhere; and that therefore he was to be apprehended in any place else, where he was presumed to <HI>lie hid,</HI> by a Writ directed to the Sheriff of the County where he is suspected to be.</P>

<P><HI>Law <HI>(Lex)</HI></HI> From the Saxon Lag or Laugh) The Law of <HI>England</HI> is divided into Three Parts: The <HI>Common Law,</HI> which is the most Ancient and General Law of the Realm; <HI>Sta∣tutes</HI> or Acts of Parliament; and thirdly, <HI>Par∣ticular Customs,</HI> I say, <HI>particular;</HI> for if it be the General Custom of the Realm, it is part of the Common Law. <HI>Coke on Littl. fol. 15. b. Bracton</HI> defines it to be <HI>Sanctio justa jubens honesta &amp; prohibens contraria.</HI> And the Divine Schoolman says, <HI>Lex humana est quoddam dicta∣men rationis, quo diriguntur humani actus.</HI> See <HI>Merchenlage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Law</HI> hath also a special signification, where∣in it is taken for that which is lawful with us, and not elswhere: As Tenant by the curtesie of <HI>England. Anno 13. Edw. 1. cap.</HI> 3. To <HI>Wage Law (Vadiare Legem)</HI> and <HI>to make,</HI> or <HI>do Law (Facere Legem.) Bracton, lib. 3. tract. 2. cap.</HI> 37. When an Action of Debt is brought against one, upon some secret Agreement or Contract, as in an Action of Detinue for Goods, Money, or Chattels, lent or left with the Defendant, the Defendant may <HI>wage his Law,</HI> if he will, that is, swear, and certain persons with him, that he detains not the Goods, or ows nothing to the Plaintiff, in Manner and Form as he hath declared, which is intended by Law, to be onely in case of the Plaintiffs want of Evidence, and when he cannot prove his Surmise by any Deed, or open Act. When one <HI>wages his Law,</HI> he shall bring with him so many of his Neigh∣bors as the Court shall assign (Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> says Eleven) to swear with him, That they think in their Consciences he hath sworn truly; who in the Civil Law are called <HI>Compurgators.</HI> The offer to make the Oath, is called <HI>Wager of Law;</HI> and when it is accomplished, it is called <HI>The making,</HI> or <HI>doing of Law.</HI> See <HI>Glanvil. lib. 1. cap. 9. &amp;</HI> 12.

<P><HI>Livery of seisin, <HI>(Deliberatio seisinae,)</HI></HI> Is a delivery of possession of Lands, Tenements, or other corporeal thing, (for, of things incor∣poreal no <HI>Livery of seisin</HI> may be) to one that has right, or a probability of right thereto. For, (as <HI>Bracton</HI> sayes, <HI>lib. 2. ca. 18. num. 3.) Traditio debet esse vestita, &amp; non nuda.</HI> It is a Ceremony used in conveyance of Lands or Te∣nements, where an estate in Feesimple, Feetayl, or a Freehold passeth; And, it is a testimonial of the willing departure of him, who makes the <HI>Livery,</HI> from the thing whereof <HI>Livery</HI> is made. And the receiving of the <HI>Livery</HI> is a willing acceptance by the other party of all that where∣of the other hath devested himself. The com∣mon manner of delivery of Seisin, is thus: If it be in the open Field, where is no House, nor building, and if the estate pass by Deed, one openly reads it or declares the effect of it, and after that is fealed, the Vendor takes it in his hands, with a clod of Earth upon a twig or bough, which he delivers to the Vendee, in the name of Possession or Seisin, according to the effect of the Deed: But if there be a House or Building upon the Land, then this is to be done at the door of it, (none being left at that time within the house) and the Ring of the door delivered to the Vendee, who enters alone, shuts the door, and presently opens it again. If it be a House, without Land or Ground, the Livery is made, and Possession taken by de∣livery of the Ring of the door, and Deed onely. And where it is without Deed, either of Lands or Tenements, there the party de∣clares by word of Mouth, before witnesses, the estate he parts with, and then delivers Seisin or Possession in manner asoresaid: And so the Land or Tenement passeth as well as by Deed, and that by force of the <HI>Livery of Seisin.</HI> See <HI>West. par. 1.

<P>Touching its original, There was antiently a certain compass of Ground, granted by the King to some <HI>Baron,</HI> or such like man of worth, for him and his heirs to dwell upon, and to ex∣ercise some jurisdiction, more or less, within that circuit, as he thought good to grant; per∣forming him such services, and paying such yearly rent for the same, as he by his grant re∣quired; and, that afterward this great Man parcelled his Land to other meaner Men, en∣joyning them again such services and rents, as he thought good; and by that means, as he became Tenant to the King, so the inferiors became Te∣nants to him. See <HI>Perkins Reservations.</HI> 670. and <HI>Horns Mirror of Justices, lib. 1. ca. du Roy Alfred.</HI> In these dayes a <HI>Manor</HI> rather signi∣fies the jurisdiction and Royalty incorporeal, than the Land or scite: For, a man may have a <HI>Manor in Gross,</HI> that is, the right and interest of a Court Baron, with the Perquisits, and ano∣ther enjoy every foot of the land belonging to it. <HI>Kitchin, fo. 4.

<P><HI>Misaventure,</HI> or <HI>Misadventure, <HI>(Fr.

As if one, thinking no harm, carelesly throwes a stone, or shoots an Arrow, wherewith he kills another. In this case he commits not Felony, but onely loseth his goods, and has a Pardon of course for his life. <HI>Stam. Pl. Cor. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>ca.</HI> 8. <HI>Brit∣ton, ca.</HI> 7. distinguishes between <HI>Aventure</HI> and <HI>Misavonture;</HI> The first he makes to be meer chance, as if a Man, being upon, or near the Water, be taken with some sudden sickness, and so fall in, and is drowned, or into the fire, and is burnt. <HI>Misaventure</HI> he says is, where a man comes to his death by some outward vio∣lence, as the fall of a Tree, the running of a Cart-wheel, the stroke of a Horse, or such like. So that <HI>Misadventure</HI> in <HI>Stamfords</HI> opi∣nion, is construed somewhat more largely then <HI>Britton</HI> understands it.</P>

Homicide by chance mix'd,</HI> he defines <HI>(Sect.</HI> 50.) to be, when the killers ignorance or negligence is joyned with the chance; as if a man lop Trees by a high-way side, in which ma∣ny usually travel, and cast down a Bough, not giving warning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which Bough a man is slain.</P>

<P>Sometimes <HI>Mises</HI> are taken for Taxes, or Tal∣lages. <HI>Anno</HI> 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. <HI>ca.</HI> 5. Sometimes for Costs or Expences, as <HI>pro misis &amp; custagiis,</HI> for Costs and Charges in the Entries of Judgments in personal Actions.</P>
<P><HI>Mise</HI> is also a word of Art, appropriated to a Writ of right, so called, because both parties have put themselves upon the meer right, to be tryed by the grand Assise, or by Battel; so as that which in all other Actions is called an <HI>Is∣sue,</HI> in a Writ of Right in that case is called a <HI>Mise.</HI> But, in a Writ of Right, if a collateral point be tryed, there it is called an <HI>Issue;</HI> and is derived from <HI>missum,</HI> because the whole cause is <HI>put</HI> upon this point. <HI>Coke on Litt. fol.</HI> 294. <HI>b. Anno</HI> 37 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>ca.</HI> 16. <HI>To joyn the Mise upon the Meer,</HI> is as much as to say, to joyn the <HI>Mise</HI> upon the cleer right, and that more plainly, to joyn upon this point, whether has the more right, the Tenant or Demandant.</P>

<P><HI>Miserere,</HI> Is the name and first word of one of the Paenitential Psalmes, most commonly that which the Ordinary gives to such guilty Malefactors, as have the benefit of the Clergy allowed by Law; and it is usually called the <HI>Psalm of mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Misericordia,</HI> Is used for an Arbitrary A∣merciament or Punishment imposed on any Person for an offence. For where the Plaintiff or Defendant in any Action is amerced, the Entry is always—<HI>Ideo in misericordia, &amp;c.</HI> And it is called <HI>Misericordia</HI> (as <HI>Fitzherbert</HI> says, <HI>Nat. Br. fol.</HI> 75.) for that it ought to be but small, and less then the offence, according to the tenor of <HI>Magna Charta, cap.</HI> 14. There∣fore, if a Man be unreasonably amerced in a Court, not of Record, as in a Court Baron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is a Writ called <HI>Moderata Miseri∣cordia</HI> directed to the Lord, or his Bailiff, commanding them, that they take <HI>Moderate A∣merciaments,</HI> according to the quality of the fault. <HI>Est enim misericordia Domini Regis</HI> (says

<P><HI>Parcinerie <HI>(Participatio,</HI></HI> from the Fr. <HI>Partir, i.

<P><HI>Pardon</HI> (Fr.)

<P><HI>Parson, <HI>(Persona)</HI></HI> Signifies the Rector of a Church; because he for his time represents the Church, and susteins the <HI>person</HI> thereof, as well in suing, as being sued in any action touching the same.

Heretofore the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> under pretence of her Supremacy, and the Dignity of S. <HI>Peters</HI> Chair, took upon her to bestow most of the Bishopricks, Abbathies, and other Eccle∣siastical Livings of worth here in <HI>England,</HI> by Mandates, before they were void; pretend∣ing therein a great care to see the Church pro∣vided of a Successor, before it needed. Whence it arose, that these <HI>Mandates</HI> or <HI>Bulls</HI> were cal∣led <HI>Gratiae Expectativae;</HI> or <HI>Provisiones,</HI> where∣of you may read a learned Discourse in <HI>Dua∣renus; de Beneficiis, lib. 3. cap.</HI> 1. These <HI>Provi∣sions</HI> were so ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with us, that at last, King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third not disgesting so intollerable an Encroachment, made a Statute in the Twen∣ty

fifth year of His Reign, <HI>Stat. 5. cap.</HI> 22. and another <HI>Stat. 6. cap.</HI> 1. and a third <HI>Anno</HI> 27. against those that drew the Kings people out of the Realm, to answer things belonging to the Kings Court; and another <HI>Anno 28 Stat. 2. cap. 1, 2. 3, &amp;</HI> 4. whereby he greatly restrained this liberty of the Pope; who notwithstand∣ing, still adventured to continue the <HI>Provisions;</HI> in so much, as King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, like∣wise made a Statute against them, <HI>Anno 12. cap.</HI> 15. And in the Thirteenth year of His Reign, <HI>cap.</HI> 2. making mention of the said first Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, ratifying the same, and appointing the punishment of those that offended against it, to be <HI>Perpetual banish∣ment, Forfeiture of their Lands, Tenements, Goods, and Chattels, &amp;c.</HI> And again in the Six∣teenth year of His Reign, <HI>cap.</HI> 5. to meet more fully with all the shifts, invented to avoid the former Statutes, he expressed the offence more particularly, and sets the same punishment to it, that he ordained in the last mentioned Sta∣tute. After him, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, in like manner aggrieved at other abuses, not fully met with in the former Statutes, in the second year of His Reign, <HI>cap. 3. &amp;</HI> 4. adds certain new Cases, and lays upon the Offenders in them, the same punishment; whereto I refer you, as likewise to <HI>Anno 9 Ejusdem, cap.</HI> 8. and 3 <HI>Hen. 5. cap.</HI> 4. and <HI>Smith de Repub. Angl. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>Some later Statutes do cast this punishment upon other Offenders, as namely the Statute of 1 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 1. upon him that denies the Kings Supremacy the second time; and the Stat. 13 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 2. upon him that affirms the Authority of the Pope; or refuseth to take the Oath of Supremacy; and the Stat. 13 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 1. upon such as are Seditious talkers of the inheritance of the Crown, or affirm the Queen to be an Heretick. And the Stat. 13 <HI>Car. 2. cap.</HI> 1. upon such as affirm the Parliament begun at <HI>Westmin∣ster, 3 Nov.</HI> 1640. is not yet dissolved, or that there is any obligation by any Oath, Covenant, or Engagement whatsoever, to endeavor a change of Government, either in Church or State, or that both or either House of Parlia∣ment have, or hath a Legislative Power with∣out the King. And the word is applied most commonly to the punishment first ordained by the Statutes before mentioned, for such as trans∣gressed them: For where it is said, that any Man for an offence committed, shall incur a <HI>Praemunire,</HI> it is meant, That he shall incur the same punishment, as is inflicted on those that transgress the Stat. 16 <HI>Rich. 2. cap.</HI> 5. commonly called the Statute of <HI>Praemunire,</HI> which kinde of Reference or Application is not unusual in our Statutes. As to the Etymology of the word, some think it proceeds from the <HI>strength</HI> given to the Crown, by the former Statutes, against the usurpation of forein power; which opinion may receive some ground from the Stat. 25 <HI>Edw. 3. stat. 6. cap.</HI> 1. But others think it grows from the Verb <HI>Praemonere,</HI> being bar∣barously turned into <HI>Praemunire,</HI> to forewarn or bid the offender take keed; or from the se∣verity or grievousness of the Punishment. Of which, a Reason may be gathered from the Form of the Writ, in <HI>Old Nat. Br. fol. 143. Praemunire facias praefatum praepositum &amp; J. R. procuratorem, &amp;c. Quod tunc sint coram nobis, &amp;c.</HI> Which words can be referred to none, but parties charged with the offence. See 3 <HI>Inst. fol.</HI> 119.</P>
<P><HI>Prender</HI> (from the Fr. <HI>Prendre, i. accipere)</HI> Is the power or right of <HI>taking</HI> a thing, before it is offered.—<HI>It lies in</HI> Render, <HI>but not in</HI> Pren∣der. <HI>Cokes Rep. 1 Part.</HI> Sir <HI>Jo. Peters</HI> Case.</P>

LL. Edw. Confess. cap.</HI> 18. The Kings Person is subject to no Mans Sute; His Possessions cannot be taken from Him, by any violence or wrong∣ful Disseisin; His Goods and Chattels are un∣der no Tribute, Toll, or Custom, nor Distrain∣able; with very many other Regal Rights, and Priviledges. See <HI>Stamf. Praerog.</HI> and the Sta∣tute of the Kings <HI>Praerogative, Anno 17 Edw.</HI> 2. and <HI>Plowden, Casu, Mines. Spelman</HI> calls it <HI>Lex Regiae Dignitatis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prerogative Court <HI>(Curia Praerogativa Archiepiscopi Cant.)</HI></HI> Is the Court wherein all Wills are proved, and all Administrations granted that belong to the Archbishop, by his <HI>Prerogative,</HI> that is, in case where the deceased had Goods of any considerable value out of the Diocess, wherein he died, and that value
<PB REF="106"/>
is ordinarily 5 l. except it be otherwise by composition between the said Archbishop, and some other Bishop, as in the Diocess of <HI>London</HI> it is 10 l. And if any contention arise, touch∣ing any such Will or Administration, the cause is properly debated and determined in this Court; the Judge whereof is called <HI>The Judge of the Prerogative Court of</HI> Canterbury.

<P><HI>Prescription <HI>(Praescriptio)</HI></HI> Is a Title, taking its substance of use and time allowed by the Law, As when a Man claims any thing, because he, his Ancestors, or they, whose estate he hath, have had, or used it all the time, whereof no memory is to the contrary; or when, for con∣tinuance of time, whereof there is no memory, a particular person hath particular right against another particular person. <HI>Kitchin, fol.</HI> 104. See <HI>Coke on Littl. fol. 140. b.</HI> But as in the Civil Law, so in the Common, <HI>Prescription</HI> may be in a shorter time, at least in some particular Cases. For example, where the Statute <HI>Anno 8 Rich. 2. cap.</HI> 4. says, That a Judge or Clerk convicted for false entring of Pleas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be Fined within two years, the two years being past, he <HI>prescribes</HI> against the punishment of the said Statute. So the Statute <HI>Anno 11 Hen.</HI> 7. says, That he, who will complain of Mainte∣nance or Embracery, whereby Perjury is com∣mitted by a Jury, must do it within six days, those six days ended, the parties <HI>prescribe:</HI> And divers other Statutes have the like Limitations of time, whence may arise a like <HI>Prescription.</HI> See <HI>Action Perpetual</HI> and <HI>Temporal.</HI> See <HI>Lamb.

<P><HI>Prest,</HI> Is used for a duty in Money to be paid by the Sheriff, upon his account in the <HI>Ex∣chequer;</HI> or for Money left or remaining in his hands. <HI>Anno 2 &amp; 3 Edw. 6. ca.</HI> 4.</P>
<P><HI>Prest Money,</HI> Is so called of the French word <HI>Prest, i. Promptus, Expeditus;</HI> for that it binds those that receive it, to be <HI>ready</HI> at all times appointed, commonly meant of Soldiers. <HI>Anno 18 Hen. 6. 19.—7 Hen. 7. 1.—7 Hen.</HI> 8 5. And 2 <HI>Edw.</HI> 6: 2.</P>

<P><HI>Presumption <HI>(Praesumptio)</HI></HI> Is of three sorts. 1. <HI>Violent,</HI> which is many times <HI>Plena Probatio;</HI> as if one be run through the Body in a House, whereof he instantly dies, and a Man is seen to come out of the House with a Bloody Sword, and no other Man was at that time in the House. 2. <HI>Probable,</HI> which moveth little. 3. <HI>Levis seu temeraria,</HI> which moves not at all. So in case of a Charter of Feossment, if all the witnesses to the Deed be deed, then <HI>Violent Presumption,</HI> which stands for a proof, is con∣tinual and quiet Possession. <HI>Coke on Littl. lib. 1. ca. 1. sect. 1.

<P><HI>Probat of Testaments, <HI>(Probatio testa∣mentorum)</HI></HI> Is the exhibiting and proving last Wills and Testaments before the Ecclesiastical Judge, delegated by the Bishop, who is <HI>Ordina∣ry</HI> of the place where the party dies. If all the deceased parties Goods, Chattels, and Debts owing him were in the same Diocess, then the Bishop of the Diocess, or the Arch-deacon (ac∣cording as their composition or prescription is) has the <HI>Probat</HI> of the <HI>Testament;</HI> if the Goods were dispersed in divers Dioceses, so that there were any summ of note, (as five pounds ordi∣narily) out of the Diocess where the party lived, then is the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> (or <HI>York)</HI> the Ordinary by his Prerogative. This <HI>Probat</HI> is made in two sorts, either in <HI>common form,</HI> or <HI>per testes;</HI> The first, is onely by the Oath of the Executor, who swears upon his credality, that the Will by him exhibited, is the last Will and Testament of the Party de∣ceased. <HI>Per testes</HI> is, when, besides his Oath, he also produceth Witnesses, or makes other proof to confirm the same; which later course is ta∣ken most commonly, where there is fear of strife or <HI>dispute</HI> about the Testators Goods: For, it is held that a Will proved in <HI>common form</HI> one∣ly, may be call'd in question any time within thirty years after. And, where a Will dispo∣ses of Lands, or Tenements of Freehold, it is now usually proved by Witnesses in <HI>Chancery.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Property <HI>(Proprietas)</HI></HI> Is the highest right that a Man hath, or can have to any thing, and no ways depending upon another Mans curtesie.

And it is used specially for an Exemption or Immunity, given by the King to a person against Sutes in Law, or other vexations, upon reasonable causes him thereto moving, which is a Branch of His Prerogative.

<P>The second form of <HI>Protection</HI> is <HI>Cum clau∣sula Nolumus,</HI> which is granted most commonly to a Spiritual Company for their Immnnity from having their Cattle taken by the Kings Ministers: But it may also be granted to a single person Spiritual or Temporal. <HI>Protection</HI> extends not to <HI>Pleas of Dower, Quare Impedit, Assise of Novel Disseisin, Darrein Presentment, Attaints,</HI> nor <HI>Pleas</HI> before Justices in Eyre.

<P><HI>Recovery <HI>(Recuperatio,</HI></HI> from the Fr. <HI>Re∣couvrer, i.

A <HI>feigned Recovery</HI> is a certain form or course set down by Law, to be observed for the better assuring Lands or Tenements unto us; the end and effect whereof is, to discontinue and destroy Estates in Remainder and Reversion, and to Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>the Intails thereof. And to this Forma∣lity, there are (in a <HI>Recovery with single Voucher)</HI> required three parties, the <HI>Demandant,</HI> the <HI>Tenant,</HI> and the <HI>Vouchee.</HI> The <HI>Demandant,</HI> is he that brings the <HI>Writ of Entry,</HI> and may be termed the <HI>Recoverer.</HI> The <HI>Tenant</HI> is he, against whom the Writ is brought, and may be called the <HI>Recoveree.</HI> The <HI>Vouchee</HI> is he, whom the Tenant <HI>Voucheth,</HI> or calls to Warranty for the Land is demand. <HI>A Recovery with double Voucher,</HI> is where the Tenant voucheth one, who Voucheth another, or the Common Vou∣chee; and <HI>a Recovery with treble Vouchers,</HI> is where three are <HI>Vouched.</HI> See <HI>West, par. 2. Symb. tit. Recoveries, sect.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>But, to explain this Point: A Man, that is desirous to cut off an Estate-tail in Lands or Tenements, to the end, to sell, give, or be∣queath them, causeth (by the contrivance of his Councel or Atturney) a feigned Writ of Entry, <HI>Sur Disseisin in le Post,</HI> to be brought for the Lands, of which, he intends to dock or cut off the Intail; and, in a feigned Count or Declaration thereupon made, pretends he was disseised by him, who, by a feigned Fine or Deed of Bargain and Sale, is named and sup∣posed to be Tenant of the Lands. This feigned Tenant, if it be a <HI>single Recovery,</HI> is made to appear and vouch the <HI>Bag-bearer</HI> of Writs, for the <HI>Custos Brevium,</HI> in the Court of <HI>Common Pleas</HI> (in which Court onely the said <HI>Common Recoveries</HI> are to be suffered) who makes de∣fault; whereupon a Judgment is, by such Fiction of Law, entred, That the <HI>Demandant</HI> shall recover, and have a <HI>Writ of Seisin,</HI> for the possession of the Lands demanded, and that the <HI>Tenant</HI> shall recover the value of the Lands, against the Lands of the <HI>Vouchee-Bag∣bearer,</HI> a poor unlanded and illiterate person, which is feigned to be a satisfaction for the Heir in Tail, though he is never to have or expect it; one <HI>Edward Howes,</HI> a Bag-bearer, and Common Vouchee, having in the space of 25 or 30 years, passed or suffered to be <HI>recovered</HI> against him, by such fictitious Actions and Pleadings, a considerable part of the Lands of <HI>England,</HI> and obliged his own Lands, when he had none at all, to answer the value of the Lands, recovered against the Tenants or Re∣mainders in Tail. This <HI>feigned Recovery</HI> is also called a <HI>Common Recovery;</HI> because it is a bea∣ten and <HI>Common Path</HI> to that end, for which it is ordained; <HI>viz.</HI> To cut off the Estates above specified.

<P><HI>Recto,</HI> Is a Writ, called a <HI>Writ of Right,</HI> which is of so high a nature, that whereas other Writs in Real Actions, are onely to recover the possession of the Lands or Tenements in questi∣on, which have been lost by an Ancestor, or by the Party Demandant himself, this aims to re∣cover both the Seisin, which some Ancestor or the Demandant himself had; and also the pro∣perty of the thing, whereof the Ancestor died not seised, as of Fee, and whereby are plead∣ed and tryed both their Rights together, <HI>viz.</HI> That of Possession and Property. And if a Man once lose his cause upon this Writ, either by Judgment, Assise, or Battel, he is without remedy, and shall be excluded, <HI>Per exceptio∣nem rei judicatae.

<P><HI>Reteiner,</HI> (from <HI>Retineo)</HI> Signifies a Ser∣vant, not menial nor familiar, that is, not con∣tinually dwelling in the house of his Lord or Master, but onely wearing his Livery, and at∣tending sometimes upon special occasions. This <HI>Livery</HI> was wont to consist of Hats (or Hoods) Badges, and other suites of one Garment by the year, and were given by Lords and great Men many times on purpose for maintenance and quarrels, and therefore have been justly prohi∣bited by many Statutes, as by 1 <HI>R. 2. ca.</HI> 7. upon pain of Imprisonment and grievous forfeiture to the King. And again, <HI>Anno 16 ejusdem, ca. 4. &amp; 20 ejusdem, ca.</HI> 1 &amp; 2. and 1 <HI>Hen. 4. ca.</HI> 7. By which the Offenders herein should make Ransom at the Kings will; and any Knight or Esquire hereby duely attainted, should lose his said <HI>Livery,</HI> and forfeit his Fee for ever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Statute is further confirmed and explain∣ed <HI>Anno 2 Hen. 4. ca.</HI> 21. and <HI>Anno 7 ejus∣dem, ca.</HI> 3. &amp; <HI>Anno 8 Hen. 6. ca.</HI> 4. And yet this offence was so deeply rooted, that <HI>Edward the Fourth</HI> was forc'd to confirm the former Sta∣tutes, and further to extend the meaning of them, as appears by 8 <HI>Edw. 4. ca.</HI> 2. adding a special pain of five pounds on every man that gives such <HI>Livery,</HI> and as much on every one so reteined, either by Writing, Oath, or Promise for every Moneth. These by the Feudists are called <HI>Affidati:</HI> And, as our Reteiners are here forbidden, so are those <HI>Affidats</HI> in other Countries.

<P><HI>Retenementum,</HI> (from <HI>Retineo)</HI> A with∣holding, reteining, or keeping back—<HI>Sine ul∣lo retenemento</HI> was a frequent expression in old Deeds.</P>
<P><HI>Retraxit,</HI> Is so called, because it is the em∣phatical word in the Entry; and is, where the Plaintiff or Demandant comes in person alone, or with the Defendant into Court, and sayes, <HI>He will proceed no further;</HI> which is peremptory, and a perpetual Barr, and may be pleaded as such to the Plaintiff in the same Action for ever. <HI>Qui semel Actionem renunciavit, amplius repe∣tere non potest.</HI> Coke on Litt. lib. 2. ca. 11.

<P><HI>Return, <HI>(Returna vel retorna)</HI></HI> From the Fr. <HI>retour,</HI> i. <HI>Reditio, reversio)</HI> has two particu∣lar applications, namely, the <HI>return</HI> of Writs by Sheriffs and other Officers, which is a Certi∣ficate made to the Court from whence the Writ issued, of that which they have done, touching the execution of the same Writs. Of <HI>returns</HI> in this signification, speaks the Statute of <HI>Westm. 2. ca.</HI> 39. So is the <HI>Return</HI> of a Commission, a Certificate, or answer to the Court of that which is done by the Commissioners, Sheriff, Bai∣liff, or others, unto whom such Writs, Commis∣sions, Praecepts, or Mandats, are directed.</P>
<P>Also certain days in every Term are called <HI>Returns,</HI> or Dayes in Bank: As <HI>Hillary Term</HI> has four <HI>Returns,</HI> viz. <HI>Octabis Hilarii, Quindena Hilarii, Crastino Purificationis, Octabis Purifica∣tionis: Easter Term</HI> five, <HI>viz. Quindena Pasche, Tres Pasche, Mense Pasche, Quinque Pasche</HI> and <HI>Crastino Assensionis</HI> Domini. <HI>Trinity Term</HI> four, viz. <HI>Crastino Trinitatis, Octabis Trinitatis, Quin∣dena Trinitatis, Tres Trinitatis:</HI> And <HI>Michaelmas Term</HI> six Returns, viz. <HI>Tres Michaelis, Mense Michaelis, Crastino animarum, Crastino Martini, Octabis Martini, Quindena Martini.</HI> See the Statutes of <HI>Dayes in Bank, Anno 51 Hen. 3. 32 Hen. 8. ca.</HI> 21. and 17 <HI>Car. 1. ca.</HI> 6.</P>
<P>The other Application of this word is in case of <HI>Replevin;</HI> for, if a man distrain Cattel for Rent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and afterwards so justifie or avow his act, that it is found lawful, the Cattel, before deliver'd to him that was distrained, upon secu∣rity given to follow the Action, shall now be <HI>returned</HI> to him that distrained them, <HI>Brook tit.</HI> Return d'avers &amp; hommes, <HI>fo.</HI> 218.</P>
<P><HI>Returno habendo,</HI> Is a Writ that lies for him, who has avow'd a Distress made of Cattel, and proved his Distress to be lawfully taken, for the <HI>return</HI> of the Cattel distreined, unto him, which before were repl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the party di∣streined, upon surety given to pursue the Acti∣on, or when the Plaint or Action is removed by <HI>Recordari;</HI> or <HI>Accedas ad Curiam,</HI> into the
<PB REF="117"/>
Court of <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and he, whose Cattel were distrained, makes default, and doth not declare or prosecute his Action.</P>
<P><HI>Returnum Averiorum,</HI> Is a Writ Judici∣al, and the same with <HI>Retorno Habendo,</HI> granted to one impleaded for taking the Cattel of an∣other, and unjust detaining them <HI>Contra vadium &amp; Plegios;</HI> and appearing upon Summons, is dismissed without day, by reason the Plaintiff makes default, and doth not declare <HI>ut supra,</HI> and it lies for the <HI>return</HI> of the Cattle to the Defendant, whereby he was summoned, or which were taken for security of his appearance upon the Summons. <HI>Regist. of Writs Judic. fol. 4. a.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Returnum Irreplegiabile,</HI> Is a Writ Ju∣dicial, sent out of the <HI>Common Pleas</HI> to the Sheriff, for the final restitution or return of Cattle to the owner, unjustly taken by another, as Damage-Feisant, and so found by the Jury before Justices of Assise in the County; or otherwise, by default of Prosecution.

<P><HI>Revenue</HI> (Fr. <HI>Revenu)</HI> Signifies properly the Yearly Rent and Profits that accrews to every Man from his Lands and Possession.</P>
<P><HI>Reversion <HI>(Reversio)</HI></HI> Signifies a returning again: Therefore <HI>Reversio terrae est tanquam terra revertens in possessione Donatori sive haere∣dibus suis post donum finitum. Coke on Littl. fol. 142. b.</HI> It hath a double acception; the one is, <HI>Jus revertendi cum status possessionis defecerit;</HI> and this is but an interest in the Land, when the Occupation and Possession of it shall fall, and so it is commonly taken. 2. When the Possession and Estate, which was parted with for a time ceaseth, and is determined in the persons of the Alienees, Assignees, Grantees, or their Heirs, or effectually returns to the Donor, his Heirs, or Assigns, whence it was de∣rived. This is the most proper signification of the word, which is derived from <HI>Revertor, &amp; apte dici non potest</HI> Reversio, <HI>antequam reverta∣tur in facto.</HI> See <HI>Littl. lib. 2. cap.</HI> 12. And see <HI>Remainder.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Reviving,</HI> Is a word metaphorically appli∣ed to Rents and Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and signifies a renew∣ing them, after they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extinguished.

<P><HI>Revocation <HI>(Revocatio)</HI></HI> Is the recalling a thing granted: Of which, you have divers in the <HI>Register of Writs.</HI> As, <HI>Revocationem brevis de audiendo &amp; terminando, fol. 124. Revocati∣onem Praesentationis, fol. 304, 305, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Serjeant <HI>(Serviens vel Serians)</HI></HI> Is diversly used and applied to sundry Offices and Cal∣lings. First, a <HI>Sergeant at Law</HI> (or of the <HI>Coyf)</HI> otherwise called <HI>Serjeant Conutor,</HI> is the highest degree taken in that Profession, as a Doctor in the Civil Law: And to these, as Men best learned, and best experienced, one Court is severed, to plead in by themselves, which is that of the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> where the Common Law of <HI>England</HI> is most strictly ob∣served; and where they are not so limited ex∣clusively to others, but they may likewise plead and be heard in other Courts, where the Judges, (who cannot be Judges until they have taken the degree of <HI>Serjeant at Law)</HI> do stile them <HI>Brother,</HI> and hear them with great respect, next unto the Kings Attorney, and Sollicitor General.

<P><HI>Tail</HI> (Fr. <HI>Taille, i. Sectura)</HI> Signisies two things grounded upon one reason. <HI>(Plowden, Ca∣su Willion. fol.</HI> 251.)

<P><HI>Tail General,</HI> Is that whereby Lands or Te∣nements are limited to a Man, and to the Heirs of his Body begotten, and it is <HI>General,</HI> be∣cause how many Women soever the Tenant, holding by this title, shall take to his Wives one after another, his issue by them all have a possibility to inherit one after another.</P>
<P><HI>Tail Special,</HI> Is that whereby Lands or Tene∣ments are limited to a Man and his Wife, and the Heirs of their two bodies begotten; be∣cause, if the Man bury his Wife, before issue, and take another, the issue by his second Wife cannot inherit the Land. Also, if Land be given to <HI>A.</HI> and his Wife <HI>B.</HI> and to their Son <HI>C.</HI> for ever; this is <HI>Tail Special.</HI> See <HI>Fee,</HI> and <HI>Littl. lib. 1. cap.</HI> 2. and <HI>New Book of Entries, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erbo Tail.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tailes <HI>(Talliae)</HI></HI> Are in these days called <HI>Tallies,</HI> explicated before: Of these we read in our Statutes two sorts, long used in the <HI>Ex∣chequer.</HI> The one <HI>Tailes of Debt (Anno 1 Rich. 2. cap.</HI> 5.) which are a kinde of Acquit∣tance for Debt paid to the King. For example, the University of <HI>Cambridge</HI> pays yearly 10 l. for such things as are by their Charter granted them in Fee-farm, 5 l. at the <HI>Annunciation,</HI> and 5 l. at <HI>Michaelmas.</HI> He that pays these, re∣ceives at each day a <HI>Tail</HI> or <HI>Talley</HI> for his dis∣charge; with both which, or notes of them, he repairs to the Clerk of the Pipes Office, and there in stead of them receives an Acquittance in Parchment for his full discharge. The other, <HI>Tails of Reward,</HI> (mentioned <HI>Anno 27 Hen. 8. cap.</HI> 11. and in other Statutes) which seem to be <HI>Tails</HI> or <HI>Tallies</HI> of allowances or recompence made to Sheriffs, for such Matters, as (to their charge) they have performed in their Office, or for such Moneys as they, by course, have cast upon them in their accounts, but cannot levy, &amp;c. See <HI>Anno 2 &amp; 3 Edw. 6. cap.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>There are also <HI>Tallies</HI> of Debt used among Subjects.—<HI>Et si creditor habeat</HI> Talleam, <HI>o∣portet creditorem probare illam per convicinos suos vel per alios, per quorum fidelitatem Balivi &amp; alii praesentes illo tempore in Curia noticiam ha∣bere possunt, &amp; si Creditor petat debitum per vocem suam simplicem, tunc debitor potest esse ad suam legem manifestatam.</HI> MS.

<P><HI>Tales</HI> (a Latin word of known significati∣on) Is used for a supply of Men, impannelled on a Jury or Enquest, and not appearing, or at their appearance, challenged by either party, as not indifferent; in which case, the Judge upon motion grants a supply to be made by the Sheriff of one or more <HI>such</HI> there present, equal in reputation to those that were empan∣nelled. Whereupon the very act of supplying is called a <HI>Tales de Circumstantibus.</HI> But he that hath had one <HI>Tales,</HI> either upon default or chal∣lenge may not have another to contain so many as the former: For the first <HI>Tales</HI> must be under the principal <HI>Pannel,</HI> except in a Cause of Appeal, and so every <HI>Tales</HI> less then other, until the number be made up of such as are without exception: Yet you may finde some exceptions to this general Rule in <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 5. These commonly called <HI>Tales</HI> may in some sort, and indeed are called <HI>Me∣liores, viz.</HI> When the whole Jury is challenged, as appears by <HI>Brook, tit.

<P><HI>Twelve men, <HI>(duodecim homines legales,)</HI></HI> otherwise called the <HI>Jury,</HI> or <HI>Enquest,</HI> is a number of twelve persons, or upwards to twen∣ty four, by whose Oath, as to matters of Fact, all Trials pass both in Civil and Criminal Cau∣ses, through all Courts of the Common Law in this Realm. In Civil Causes, when proof is made of the matter in question, the point of the Fact (on which they are to give their ver∣dict) is deliver'd likewise to them, which we call the <HI>Issue,</HI> then they are put in mind of their Oath, to do right, and are, by the Judges, sum∣ming up the evidence, sent out of the Court, by themselves to consider upon the Evidence on both sides, untill they are agreed: which done, they return to the Court, and deliver their ver∣dict by the Mouth of their Foreman; accor∣ding to which (if the matter be not arrested, or staid by the discretion of the Judge or the Court,) the Judgment passeth.</P>
<P>In <HI>Causes Criminal</HI> there are two sorts of Enquests, one called the <HI>Grand Enquest,</HI> the other the <HI>Enquest of life and death;</HI> The first is so called, either because it consists of sixteen at the least, or else because all causes Criminal or Penal first pass through them; whereas the other Enquest is especially appointed for one or few matters touching life and death. Those of the <HI>Grand Enquest</HI> are called by <HI>Bracton, 12 Milites;</HI> because they were wont to be Knights, if so many could be had. And their Fun∣ction is to receive all Presentments of any Of∣fence, and accordingly to give their general opinion of them, by writing either these words <HI>billa vera</HI> upon the Bill of Presentment, which is an Inditement of the Party presented, or else <HI>Ignoramus,</HI> which is a doubting of the Fact presented.

<HI>Waste</HI> is brought for recovery of the thing wasted, and trebble damages. See <HI>Vasto. Waste</HI> of the Forest is most properly, where a Man cuts down his own Woods within the Forest, without Licence of the King or Lord Cheif Justice in Eyre. See <HI>Manwood, 2 Part, cap. 8. num. 4 &amp;</HI> 5.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Waste</HI> is taken for those Lands which are not in any one Mans occupation, but lie common, which seem to be so called, because the Lord cannot make such profit of them, as he does of his other Lands, by rea∣son of that use which others have of it, in passing to and fro. Upon this none may build, cut down Trees, dig, &amp;c. without the Lords Licence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Year, day, and Waste, (Annus, Dies, &amp; Vastum)</HI> Is a punishment or forfeiture belonging to Petit-Treason or Felony, where∣of you may read <HI>Stamf. Pl. Cor. lib. 3. cap.</HI> 30. And see <HI>Year, Day,</HI> and <HI>Waste.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Waste-ground <HI>(Vastus fundus)</HI></HI> Is so called, because it lies as <HI>Waste,</HI> with little or no profit to the Lord of the Mannor, and to distinguish it from the Demesns in the Lords hands. 2 <HI>Part Inst. fol.</HI> 656. See <HI>Waste.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Year, Day, and Waste, <HI>(Annus, dies, &amp; vastum)</HI></HI> Is a part of the Kings Prerogative, whereby he challengeth the profits of their Lands and Tenements, for a year and a day that are attainted of Petit-Treason, or Felony, whosoever is Lord of the Mannor, whereto the Lands or Tenements do belong; and not onely so, but in the end may <HI>waste</HI> the Tene∣ment, destroy the Houses, Root up the Woods, Gardens, Pasture, and Plough up Meadows, except the Lord o the Fee agree with him for redemption of such <HI>Waste;</HI> afterwards re∣storing it to the Lord of the Fee, whereof you may read at large <HI>Stamf. Praerog. cap. 16. fol.</HI> 44.</P>
<P><HI>Yelding</HI> or <HI>Yéelding,</HI> and <HI>Paying (Red∣dendo &amp; solvendo)</HI> Is a corruption from the Sax. geldan and gyldan, <HI>Sulvere, praestare.</HI> And in <HI>Domesday Gildare,</HI> is frequently used for <HI>sol∣vere, reddere;</HI> the Saxon g being often mis∣taken into Y.</P>
<P><HI>Yeme,</HI> Is an ancient corruption of <HI>Hieme,</HI> Winter, as I have seen in an old Deed—<HI>Red∣dend.—Ad Festum S. Martini in <HI>Yeme,</HI></HI> &amp;c. And in another of 4 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. Thus,—<HI>Reddend quando dict. quatuor acrae terrae s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣miaantur somine</HI> Yemali, <HI>duodecim</HI> Bussel. <HI>boni &amp; legalis frumenti ad Festum Purificationis, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yeven</HI> or <HI>Yeoven,</HI> (as we use at the end of Indentures, and other Instruments, <HI>Yeoven the day and year first above written)</HI> Is a corrup∣tion from the Saxon Geofian, <HI>i. Dare,</HI> and is the same with <HI>Given.</HI> So <HI>Dictum de Kenelworth</HI> concludes with—<HI>Yeoven and proclaimed in the Castle of</HI> Kenelworth <HI>the day before the Ca∣lends of Nov.</HI> Anno 1256.</P>
<P><HI>Yeman</HI> or <HI>Yoman</HI> (from the Sax. geman, <HI>i. Communis)</HI> These <HI>Camden</HI> in his <HI>Britan, pag.</HI> 105. placeth next in order to <HI>Gentleman,</HI> call∣ing them <HI>ingenuos,</HI> whose opinion the Statute affirms, <HI>Anno 6 Ric. 2. cap.</HI> 4. And 20 <HI>Ejusdem. cap.</HI> 2. Sir <HI>Tho. Smith</HI> in his <HI>Repub. Angl. lib. 1. cap.</HI> 23. calls him a <HI>Yoman,</HI> whom our Laws call <HI>Legalem hominem,</HI> which (says he) is in English a Freeman born, that may dispend of his own Free-land, in yearly Revenue to the sum of Forty shillings Sterling. <HI>Verstegan</HI> (in his restitution of <HI>Decayed Intelligence, cap.</HI> 10.) writes, That <HI>Gemen</HI> among the ancient Teu∣tonicks and <HI>Gemein</HI> among the Modern, sig∣nifies as much as <HI>Common,</HI> and that the first Let∣ter G. is in this word, as in many others, turn∣ed into Y. and so written <HI>Yemen,</HI> which there∣fore signifies <HI>Commoner. Yoman</HI> signifies also an officer in the Kings House, in the middle place between the <HI>Serjeant</HI> and the <HI>Groom;</HI> as <HI>Yoman</HI> of the Chaundry, <HI>Yoman</HI> of the Scallery. <HI>Anno 33 Hen. 8. cap. 12. Yoman</HI> of the Crown. <HI>Anno 3 Edw 4. cap.</HI> 5. The word <HI>Yongmen</HI> is used for <HI>Yomen</HI> in the Statute of 33 <HI>Hon. 8. cap.</HI> 10. And I have seen it written <HI>Jeman</HI> in old Deeds. See <HI>Jeman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yingeman. <HI>LL. Hen. 1. cap. 16. Danagil∣dum quod aliquando</HI> Yingeman <HI>dabatur, i.</HI></HI> 12 d. <HI>de unaquaque hida per annum, si ad ter∣minum non reddatur,</HI> Wita <HI>emendetur.</HI> The Learned <HI>Spelman</HI> thinks this may possibly be mistaken for <HI>Inglishman</HI> or <HI>Englishman,</HI> though he findes it written <HI>Yingeman,</HI> both in Sir <HI>Rob.
