<HEAD>PROLOGUE Spoken by the Genius of <HI>England,</HI> holding a Trident in one hand and a Sword in the other.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IS <HI>England's</HI> Genius, that Victorious Name,</L>
<L>Which shakes the World and fills the mouth of Fame,</L>
<L>So much forgot, as you mispend your Witt</L>
<L>(which my Great Deeds as Greatly might have Writt)</L>
<L>To court a Fancy, or improve a Dreame,</L>
<L>And seek new Worlds for a less noble Theame?</L>
<L>Can you in Armes conspiring Nations see,</L>
<L>And think on any thing but Fame, and Me?</L>
<L>While the loud Cannon, with prophetick sound,</L>
<L>Foretells our King must be in <HI>Paris</HI> crown'd,</L>
<L>And with such Heat once more invade the French,</L>
<L>As all the Waves between us cannot quench,</L>
<L>To the just fury of whose Fatall Blowes</L>
<L>Fleets, Walls, and Armies they in vaine oppose;</L>
<L>This Trophy, which so gloriously to yours</L>
<L>Add's a fourth Crown, and those four Crownes secures,</L>
<L>The <HI>Belgian</HI> Admirall usurping bore,</L>
<L>And I from him and all his Tritons tore.</L>
<L>He to another Element was blowne,</L>
<L>Who thought himself Immortall in his owne;</L>
<L>For still the Sea his Losses did Repair,</L>
<L>Till our <HI>Alcides</HI> killd him in the Ayr.</L>
<L>This Sword, which in <HI>French</HI> blood so often dyed</L>
<L>Intail'd success on the young <HI>Edwards</HI> side,</L>
<L>Resign'd to you shall all those Arts exceed</L>
<L>Which made him Triumph and that Kingdome Bleed.</L>
<L>Their frighted Lillies shall confess their loss,</L>
<L>Wearing the Crimson livery of your Cross;</L>
<L>And all the World shall learn by their Defeat,</L>
<L>Our Charles, not theirs, deserves the name of Great.</L>

<HEAD>THE Black Prince.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE FIRST ACT.</HEAD>
<STAGE>The first Scene is a magnificent Palace, King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third standing in the middle of the Theater, environ'd with his Nobi∣lity and Guards; the Lord <HI>Delaware</HI> presents the King a Letter which when he has read, the King sayes;</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>BRave <HI>Delaware,</HI> my Son doth let me know</L>
<L>How much my Empire to thy Sword does owe;</L>
<L>What, generous Youth, could more thy Fame advance</L>
<L>Then with thy hand to take King <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>France.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, What you say, more Fame to me does yield</L>
<L>Then I could gain in <HI>Peictiers</HI> glorious Field;</L>
<L>For 'tis more honour to be priz'd by You</L>
<L>Then 'tis another Monarch to subdue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>No Subject winning Glory can admit</L>
<L>Such Joy, as does his King rewarding it:</L>
<L>The Chape of that Kings Sword whom thou didst take</L>
<L>The Crest for ever of thy Armes shall make;</L>
<L>In that addition to them shall be shown,</L>
<L>While the World lasts, the honour thou hast won:</L>
<L>To thee thy General leaves it to relate</L>
<L>The English Glory and the Frenchmans Fate.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>As soon, Sir, as the Prince to <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> came</L>
<L>(So much doth Glory his great Soul inflame)</L>
<L>He took the Field, and did forthwith regain</L>
<L>All that King <HI>Iohn</HI> possess'd in <HI>Aquitaine;</HI></L>
<L>Then with like speed <HI>Anjou</HI> he did subdue,</L>
<L>And all his Towns, but <HI>Poictiers,</HI> of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>itou,</HI></L>
<L>That place alone his Forces durst oppose.</L>
<L><HI>Guesclin</HI> the Gallantest of all our foes</L>
<L><HI>Poictiers</HI> did for their Governour admit,</L>
<L>And he a while bravely defended it,</L>
<L>Yet our Success was but a while deny'd,</L>
<L>That by a greater it might be supply'd;</L>
<L>For Heav'n decreed, that <HI>Poictiers,</HI> Sir, should yield</L>
<L>As deathless Wreaths to you as <HI>Cressy</HI> Field;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
The noblest Wreaths which ever Victor wore</L>
<L>Wreaths which shall last when Time shall be no more.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>But tell me how King <HI>Iohn</HI> employ'd his time,</L>
<L>While those three Provinces were torn from him.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>He, the mean while, rais'd all the Powers of <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>And to relieve the City did advance.</L>
<L>The Prince had notice of a strength so great,</L>
<L>And timely might have made a fair retreat;</L>
<L>Yet since before the place he once did lie,</L>
<L>He was resolv'd to take it, or to die:</L>
<L>From this resolve he could not, Sir, be won.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>He did therein, but what became my Son;</L>
<L>No humane force could ever yet subdue</L>
<L>An English Prince, and English Army too.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>The French appear, and <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ctiers</HI> spacious plain</L>
<L>Was not enough their Army to contain;</L>
<L>Th' advantages of ground our General takes,</L>
<L>And plants before his Squadrons sharp'ned Stakes;</L>
<L>With the like Art, but yet in thicker Ranks,</L>
<L>He strongly fortify'd his Rear and Flanks.</L>
<L>The Word was giv'n, and all our Bows were bent,</L>
<L>When a French Herauld to the Prince was sent,</L>
<L>Who told him that his King had thought it good,</L>
<L>To avoid the shedding of much Christian blood,</L>
<L>To let him know he could not win the Field,</L>
<L>And all should have fair quarter, would He yield:</L>
<L>The Prince unmov'd did instantly reply,</L>
<L>None does deserve to live who fears to die:</L>
<L>Go tell your King, those English I command</L>
<L>The name of Quarter hardly understand;</L>
<L>But that, ere night, he may have cause to know,</L>
<L>What we refuse to take we may bestow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>This answer did the message well befit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Herauld, Sir, return'd amaz'd at it,</L>
<L>Their odds in number rais'd them to that height,</L>
<L>They thought they came to take us, not to fight.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>How many were the French?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>—————Themselves confess'd,</L>
<L>That eighty Thousand men they were at least.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>What was my Son?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>————The truth I do not wrong,</L>
<L>Protesting he was but eight Thousand strong;</L>
<L>But those eight Thousand, Sir, were English men.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>And One of those may well be reckon'd Ten.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, since your Army by your Son was led,</L>
<L>We all did then believe what now you said;</L>
<L>For in his eyes we our Success did see,</L>
<L>His looks did ante-date our Victory.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
His face, that morning, to us all did show</L>
<L>Those Lawrels, which that ev'ning Crown'd his Brow;</L>
<L>Now all the Drums do beat, the Trumpets sound,</L>
<L>The Soldiers shout the trembling Air does wound,</L>
<L>The flying Arrows such thick clouds had made,</L>
<L>As ev'n the heat of Fight produc'd a shade:</L>
<L>Our Van brave <HI>Oxford</HI> and great <HI>Talb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t</HI> lead,</L>
<L>Whose Swords, that day, did much increase the Dead:</L>
<L><HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> did command our Rear,</L>
<L>And there deserv'd those Titles which they bear;</L>
<L>So did <HI>Audley,</HI> Sir, and <HI>Barkley</HI> too,</L>
<L>Whom all did imitate but none outdo.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>The like at <HI>Cressy</HI> by those Six was done,</L>
<L>Danger they slight where Glory may be won.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>Fortune, a while, did fear to ruine <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>But when the Prince his battle did advance,</L>
<L>He courted her with Valour so Sublime,</L>
<L>As she turn'd just, and did declare from him;</L>
<L>They in three Armies did divide their Pow'rs,</L>
<L>And every one of them did treble ours;</L>
<L>By which our Prince found, when the day was done,</L>
<L>That he had fought Three battels to gain One:</L>
<L>So many heaps of Frenchmen there were slain,</L>
<L>As into Hills they seem'd to change the Plain;</L>
<L>And all those Clouds, their Horses feet had rais'd,</L>
<L>Were with the Blood of their dead Riders laid:</L>
<L>Two Lords arm'd like King <HI>Iohn</HI> were in the Field,</L>
<L>And by our Princes hand they both were kill'd;</L>
<L>In doing which he did prodigious things,</L>
<L>For though they were Not, yet they fought like Kings,</L>
<L>While in the Field wars bloody Game was plaid;</L>
<L><HI>Guesclin</HI> did sally, and was Prisoner made.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>In your Relation you omit one thing</L>
<L>I fain would hear, 'tis, how you took the King.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, In the heat of Battel 'twas my chance</L>
<L>To fight with, and to take King <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>France;</HI></L>
<L>'Twas Fortune onely favour'd me in this.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your Modesty great as your Valour is,</L>
<L>For here my So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> to me at large does write</L>
<L>The Honour which you purchas'd in the Fight.</L>
<L>And all those brave Attempts which you did make,</L>
<L>Before your Regal Prisoner you did take;</L>
<L>Nothing which you perform'd from me is hid</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>He writes what I'de have Done, not what I Did:</L>
<L>When the French King into my pow'r did fall,</L>
<L>I did conduct him to our General,</L>
<L>Who then was giving of Rewards to those</L>
<L>Who took two hundred Colours from your Foes,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Amidst those Glorious Trophies, Sir, he stood,</L>
<L>His Armour cover'd all with dust and blood;</L>
<L>Those sights afresh the Captive King did wound.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>None in a Nobler Posture could be found.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>When to the Prince I nam'd King <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>He hastily to meet him did advance,</L>
<L>And to his Prisoner did as humbly bow,</L>
<L>As, Sir, he could have done, had it been You.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>He did therein what did a Prince befit,</L>
<L>Fierce in the Fight and Humble after it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>The King then said, since Fortune does decree,</L>
<L>I should be taken by my Enemy;</L>
<L>Part of the wounds she gives, she also cures,</L>
<L>Since now I fall into such hands as Yours;</L>
<L>I am your Prisoner, Sir, and come to know</L>
<L>The end you aim at by my being so.</L>
<L>The Prince, in whom all Vertues do reside,</L>
<L>Pitying the Kings misfortune, thus reply'd;</L>
<L>That, mighty Prince, to which I most pretend</L>
<L>Is, from an Enemy you'll turn a Friend:</L>
<L>And if you'll grant what now is begg'd by me,</L>
<L>I'le prize it more then this dayes Victory.</L>
<L>These words the Prince with such an Accent grac'd,</L>
<L>As by the King he closely was embrac'd,</L>
<L>Who told him, in this Action you have shown,</L>
<L>You have more ways to Conquer me then one,</L>
<L>And, Sir, to prove this does my Mind subdue;</L>
<L>That which you ask of Me I beg of You.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>This last Success transcends the other Three:</L>
<L>'Tis more to Gain then Beat an Enemy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dela.</SPEAKER>
<L>All things to tell you too much time would take,</L>
<L>But then so strict a Friendship they did make,</L>
<L>As Our Prince vow'd he would sollicit you</L>
<L>To grant the King a Peace and Freedom too;</L>
<L>Then by a Generosity Sublime,</L>
<L>He did that night at sopper wait on Him:</L>
<L>By which that Vanquish'd Monarch well might boast,</L>
<L>He there Receiv'd more Honour then he Lost.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Son in this did such High Worth express,</L>
<L>As I more value It then his Sccess.</L>

<L>For their Reception every thing prepare</L>
<L>Which may your joys and your Respects declare.</L>
<L>I'le treat this Royal Pris'ner at a rate</L>

<L>Ah my dear Friend; it is in vain you strive</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sev.</SPEAKER>
<L>This is the day you promis'd I should know</L>
<L>That Fatal Sorrow under which You bow.</L>
<L>I thought the Charms of Musick might abate</L>
<L>The Grief which springs from what you will relate.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aliz.</SPEAKER>
<L>Too mean a thought you of my Grief admit,</L>
<L>In thinking any thing can Lessen it.</L>
<L>Who would not all delights of Life decline</L>
<L>That had a Soul so out of Tune as Mine?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sev.</SPEAKER>
<L>Do not from such a Friend your self refrain,</L>
<L>My Help may put your Soul in Tune again:</L>
<L>'Tis to your Promise, Madam, that I trust,</L>
<L>Let not your Sorrow make you prove Unjust.</L>
<L>If Grief should make you to such Wrong submit,</L>
<L>You will Deserve as well as Suffer it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliz.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Fatal Promise why do you pursue;</L>
<L>Though Old Griefs, when related, turn to New,</L>
<L>Yet you no longer shall of me complain,</L>
<L>I'le rather Heighten then Deserve my Pain.</L>
<L>You know, Dear Friend, when to this Court I came,</L>
<L>My Eyes did all our bravest youths Inflame:</L>
<L>And in that happy state I liv'd a while,</L>
<L>When Fortune did betray me with a smile;</L>
<L>Or rather Love against my Peace did fight;</L>
<L>And, to revenge his Power which I did ssight,</L>
<L>Made <HI>Edward</HI> our Victorious Monarch be,</L>
<L>One of those Many who did Sigh for Me.</L>
<L>All other Flames but His I did deride,</L>
<L>They rather made my Trouble than my Pride:</L>
<L>But this, when told me, made me quickly know,</L>
<L>Love is a God to which all Hearts must bow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sev.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis certain every Creature that hath Breath</L>
<L>Is no more priviledg'd from Love than Death:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Think you what is your Duty is your Crime,</L>
<L>Or else do you repent you Conquer'd Him?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aliz.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh had you heard, in what a Mourning way</L>
<L>He the first time his Passion did display,</L>
<L>And had you seen that Grief and matchless Grace</L>
<L>Which did at once Cloud and Adorn his Face;</L>
<L>You had admir'd such Differing Charmes to see,</L>
<L>But more admir'd had they not Conquer'd Me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Ah Friend, I grant 'tis something else indeed,</L>

<L>The Bright <HI>Plantagenet</HI> I there did see,</L>
<L>And soon my Heart a Passion did admit</L>
<L>Vast as those Beauties which created it:</L>

<L>It springs at once from Love and Friendship too:</L>

<L>The Prince on her did alwayes fix his Sight,</L>
<L>And often from his breast a Sigh wold steal</L>
<L>Which as his Looks his Passion did reveal;</L>
<L>But that which made my Trouble much more great</L>
<L>Was, when her Sight did with the Prince's meet:</L>
<L>A bright Vermillion in her Face would rise,</L>
<L>Then with a Sigh she would cast down her Eyes;</L>
<L>What stronger Prooff could either of them show,</L>
<L>That he lov'd her, and that she Lov'd him too:</L>

<L>By Gifts I won a Lady who of late</L>

<L>How can you justly, Sir, this News deplore</L>
<L>Since I but tell you what you thought before.</L>
<L>'Tis the least Wonder does in Love befall,</L>
<L>To think a Mistress is Ador'd by all.</L>
<L>I as a Lover to that Thought was bound,</L>
<L>But now that Thought a Certainty is found,</L>
<L>Which justly in my Soul does grief infuse.</L>

<L>She has acquainted me with stranger News,</L>

<L>How strange and intricate a Pow'r is Fate,</L>
<L>The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> finds in a slighted Flame</L>
<L>The Noblest of all wayes to raise his Fame;</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="14"/>
Glory does heal what Love made him endure,</L>
<L>And his Dispair presents him with his Cure.</L>
<L>He mist her Love a while, that he might be</L>
<L>More worthy of it by his Conquering Me;</L>
<L>A happy Planet at his Birth did Reign;</L>
<L>A seeming Loss brings him a double Gain;</L>
<L>While Fate with me so cruelly does act,</L>
<L>As by one Loss a greater I contract,</L>
<L>Successless Love his way to Fame does prove,</L>
<L>And loss of Fame does make my way to Love.</L>

<L>You wrong your Vertue by this strange Debate;</L>
<L>The Brave are still the makers of their Fate;</L>
<L>'Tis onely, Sir, those men whose Souls are low,</L>
<L>Which first made Fate and then to Fate did bow.</L>
<L>Nor War nor Love, Sir, are Resistless Powers,</L>
<L>Both have their Happy as Unhappy Hours;</L>
<L>But he who does for one Mischance Dispair,</L>
<L>Can ne're be prosperous in Love or War.</L>
<L>As I have told you what has rais'd your Grief,</L>
<L>So now I will present you some Relief;</L>
<L>For my informer, Sir, to me has swore,</L>
<L>That though the Prince your Mistress does Adore,</L>
<L>He hath not yet his Love to her disclos'd,</L>
<L>She therefore, Sir, has hopefully propos'd.</L>
<L>That you this moment to the Prince would go</L>
<L>And let him from your self this Passion know;</L>
<L>His Friendship for you and so great a Trust</L>
<L>Will make him cease to Love or be Unjust;</L>
<L>If, Sir, he does the first, your End you win,</L>
<L>And by the last make Rivalship no Sin:</L>
<L>This, Sir, which She Proposes I approve.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<L>No Friendship ever yet could conquer Love,</L>
<L>He to that Passion vainly does pretend</L>
<L>Who can resign his Mistris to his Friend;</L>
<L>I scarce can relish what she does advise,</L>
<L>It seems to me nor Generous, nor Wise,</L>
<L>For in vain hopes of what it ne're will do</L>
<L>I clearer shall the lesser Friendship show;</L>
<L>My Friendship too were guilty of a Crime</L>
<L>Should his do more for me then mine for him.</L>

<L>Sooner then I my Passion will forgo</L>
<L>I will forsake my Crown and Friendship too.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Then pray, Sir, follow what she does Advise,</L>
<L>And you will find 'tis Generous and wise;</L>
<L>If to the Prince you first your Passion own</L>
<L>You first do that which he first should have done,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="15"/>
And lay that Blame on him while this you do,</L>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Earl of <HI>KENT</HI> to the Lord DELAVVARE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MY Death forces me to discover by what Arts I obtai∣ned, from the Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>the faire</HI> Plan∣tagenet. <HI>Before He ador'd her I did; and as soon as he fell in Love, (not knowing mine) he made me his Confi∣dent; but the King, being against the match, the Prince the better to cloud his reall passion for</HI> Plantagenet, <HI>seem'd to have one for the fair</HI> Aurelia; <HI>but still trusted me with the Superscription, Cypher, and Seale, which he used when he writ to my</HI> Plantagenet, <HI>and I had the fatal employ∣ment of carrying all their Letters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At length, the Glory the Prince wonn at</HI> Cressy, <HI>joyn'd with his grief for the King's denyal, conquer'd his Father; and the Day was appointed for his marrying</HI> Plantagenet, <HI>which, if not prevented,</HI> I <HI>found would be the Day of my Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This I imparted to my Mother, who had no small as∣cendant over</HI> Plantagenet, <HI>and by my Mothers advice, I got the Prince to write a Letter to</HI> Aurelia, <HI>(whom I seem'd to be passionatly in Love with) wherein he beg'd her pardon, for having counterfeited a Love to her, when</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="31"/>
<HI>his was otherwise disposed of; but to repair it, he earnest∣ly recommended me to her affection, as most worthy of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Letter I seal'd, and superscribed with the Cypher the Prince alwayes made use of to</HI> Plantagenet, <HI>whom my Mother had so warmly alarm'd, with the Prince</HI>'s <HI>passion for</HI> Aurelia, <HI>that this letter being delivered to</HI> Plantagenet, <HI>in a fit time, all written with the Prince</HI>'s <HI>own hand, sealed and superscribed, as all his Letters to her were wont to be, made her so abhor the Prince</HI>'s <HI>inconstancie, that in the dictates of those resentments, she gave her self to me, whereunto my Mothers Friendship with her, did high∣ly contribute.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Prince in despair, undertakes the war with</HI> France, <HI>and, I, soon after, disguised to all but you, follow'd him, in hope by some great action to wash off the Guilt my Love for∣ced me to contract; but here I met my Death. Tell them all this; and that I hope their hatred to me, will be bu∣ried in my Grave.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THe Poet, Sir, has offer'd to your sight</L>
<L>An <HI>English</HI> prince, whose Fame appear'd so Bright,</L>
<L>As never any since his time was known,</L>
<L>To shine with clearer Lustre, but your Own;</L>
<L>For though Immortal Honour he did gain,</L>
<L>By conquering <HI>France,</HI> and by restoring <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>Yet, Sir, you brought Three Kingdomes to Remorse,</L>
<L>And gain'd by Vertue more then he by Force;</L>
<L>Which, Sir, on you a greater Name bestows</L>
<L>By conquering Them by whom he conquered Those:</L>
<L>'Tis more by Vertue <HI>England</HI> to o'recome,</L>
<L>Then by the <HI>English</HI> to beat Christendome.</L>
<L>As when the Universe was to be made,</L>
<L>The Vast Design was on the Waters laid;</L>
<L>So you in Conquering it like Method keep,</L>
<L>Laying your first Foundation in the Deep:</L>
<L>Though the Black Prince, so happy, Sir, did prove,</L>
<L>As to be Crown'd with Victory and Love,</L>
<L>Yet Sir, he knows from you he may receive</L>
<L>A Nobler Crown then War or Love can give;</L>
<L>This makes him like the Poet trembling stand,</L>
<L>Till, Sir, that Crown be given him by your Hand.</L>

<L>HOld, hold.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Why, Sir?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>What is't you mean to say?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>I mean to speak the <HI>Prologue</HI> to the Play.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>Therefore to stop you I esteem it fit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>The Poet then will not be thought a Wit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>A wit Forsooth!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, Sir, a wit.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>What's that?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>A wit is in one word—I know not what.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of that kind Title give your Poet Ioy.</L>
<L>A wit is then in French, <HI>A je ne scay quoi.</HI></L>
<L>A modish Name.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet, Sir, that Name to gain,</L>
<L>How many of our Writers crack their brain?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>That's a mistake, for who'd that Name contract,</L>
<L>Must, e're he Court it, first his brain have crackt.</L>
<L>To be a Wit (believe me, Sir, 'tis true)</L>
<L>Is the worst State a Man can Fall into.</L>
<L>The Wits first vow, is, that they none will spare,</L>
<L>But jeer at every Creature that they dare;</L>
<L>And the No-Wits, these Wits so dis esteem,</L>
<L>That they give Money oft to hiss at them;</L>
<L>'Tis the Wits Nature, or at best their Fate,</L>
<L>Others to scorn, and one another hate.</L>
<L>They would be <HI>Sultans</HI> if they had their will,</L>
<L>For each of them would all his Brothers kill.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hold, Sir, the Wits you too severely school.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>I say, to be a Wit's to be a Fool;</L>
<L>For who but such a Creature would not grudge,</L>
<L>T' have any one for half a Crown his Iudge;</L>
<L>Nay, toil, that he such a wise Act may do,</L>
<L>Then lets the Players get the half Crown too.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why was this Play then by the Author writ?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>In fear, 'tis said, of being call'd a Wit.</L>
<L><PB REF="36"/>
And many a Man does doubt that it his Friend,</L>
<L>Ere three hours hence he will have reach'd his end.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>Take heed, if at this rate we gable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>re</L>
<L>Our Poet will attain his end before.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>For fear of that 'tis best we should be gone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<L>What without <HI>Prologue?</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm resolv'd to have none.</L>
<L>For some on Wit that needless Tax did lay,</L>
<L>Which Poets now are grown too poor to pay.</L>
<L>But yet as mettled School-boyes set to cuff,</L>
<L>Will not confess that they have done enough,</L>
<L>Though dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ly weary, till spectators do</L>
<L>At once both part and call them good Boys too;</L>
<L>But then these Cussers monstrous joyful are:</L>
<L>Iust thus it would with all our Poets fare,</L>
<L>Would you decree (what I for them implore)</L>
<L>Poets with <HI>Prologues</HI> nere should meddle more.</L>
<L>'Tis the best thing you for your selves could do,</L>
<L>For <HI>Prologues</HI> first tire Poets and then you;</L>
<L>If you'l not do't, while in your power it lies,</L>
<L>They'l do it of themselves, if they be wise:</L>

<STAGE>Demetrius <HI>and</HI> Aretus.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>TRyphon,</HI> I grant, through Seas of blood has gone</L>
<L>To force his passage to the <HI>Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ian</HI> Throne;</L>
<L>But how men gain their Pow'r the Gods do not</L>
<L>So much regard, as how 'tis us'd when got.</L>
<L>Our Murther'd King <HI>Antiochus</HI> did own,</L>
<L>That <HI>Tryphons</HI> Father did restore his Crown,</L>
<L>Which made him trust the Sons ambitious youth</L>
<L>With so much pow'r as did corrupt his truth:</L>
<L>This our dead Prince discover'd, but too late,</L>
<L>Which did provoke <HI>Tryphon</HI> to act his fate:</L>
<L>For Kings should not to too great Subjects shew</L>
<L>They mean their ruine, till they act it too;</L>
<L>And he almost deserves to lose his Throne</L>
<L>Who makes a Subject's power exceed his own.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>What ever you in his defence have brought,</L>
<L>Rather then lessen doth augment his fault;</L>
<L>For what could show this Tyrant more unjust</L>
<L>Then to abuse such gratitude and trust;</L>
<L>Trust, which the wicked often does reclame,</L>
<L>This monstr'ous wickedness does more inflame.</L>
<L>That he repents nothing can us perswade,</L>
<L>Since what makes others good has made him bad.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>When once Ambition does the mind devour,</L>
<L>Men Sacrifice their Vertue to their Pow'r.</L>
<L><HI>Antiochus</HI> had rais'd him up so high,</L>
<L>As he was either to usurp, or die;</L>
<L>And when he had perceiv'd the Kings distrust,</L>
<L>He made him think, that what was safe was just.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh let him not be pleaded for by you,</L>
<L>Who did his King depose and murther too,</L>
<L>Lest on your self th' Usurpers blood you bring;</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis less to kill, then to arraign a King;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="37"/>
And he who does an Empires loss endure</L>
<L>Cannot think death a punishment, but cure.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>But Actions should be taken as they'are meant.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>To vindicate him is not my intent;</L>
<L>Since all which can in his excuse be said</L>
<L>Is, that his Pride his Virtue has betray'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>No glimps of vertue e're in him could shine</L>
<L>Who kill'd his King, and all the Royal line.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>After he had the chief of it supprest,</L>
<L>He thought it was unsafe to save the rest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ambition made him act the Parricide,</L>
<L>And Cruelty must then preserve his Pride.</L>
<L>By the same rule he ought to shed the blood</L>
<L>Of all his Country-men that dare be good:</L>
<L>Then from the Throne let us th' Usurper fling.</L>
<L>To save our selves, and to Revenge the King:</L>
<L>For should we to this Tyranny submit,</L>
<L>We shall deserve as well as suffer it:</L>
<L>And to the virtuous 'twill much more appear</L>
<L>Such a misfortune to deserve then bear.</L>
<L>That <HI>Tryphon</HI> calls you favourite I know,</L>
<L>But to his Fear alone that name you ow:</L>
<L>Yet though the kindness which he feigns were true,</L>
<L>Even layes the ground of what I call you to;</L>
<L>From you he merits death, since he hath dar'd</L>
<L>To hope, such Friendship could such Guilt have spar'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whom <HI>Tryphon</HI> fears he doth to death pursue,</L>
<L>And if he fear'd me he might kill me too,</L>
<L>But, that he fears me not, he could not give</L>
<L>A stronger proof then that he lets me live.</L>
<L>Yet do not think his friendship such a charm,</L>
<L>As from revenge it could confine my arme;</L>
<L>But if my patience you a sin esteem,</L>
<L>It springs from Love to <HI>Syria,</HI> not to him:</L>
<L>For since the Royal line are made away,</L>
<L>Were <HI>Tryphon</HI> kill'd, who should the Scepter sway?</L>
<L>All the Ambitious for the Throne would fight,</L>
<L>For where none has the Title, all have Right.</L>
<L>Thus while we cast a bloody Tyrant down</L>
<L>By Blood, we raise another to the Crown.</L>
<L>'Tis this, 'tis this which chiefly frightens me,</L>
<L>We may change Tyrants, not the Tyranny.</L>
<L>Where Force is Title, Force must make it good,</L>
<L>And who comes in by Armes must reign by Blood.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>Banish such groundless fears, for he alone</L>
<L>Who kills the Tyrant should ascend his Throne.</L>
<L>Who from this Tyranny does <HI>Syria</HI> free,</L>
<L>All will confess, deserves our King to be.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="37"/>
If by your Arm this generous Act is done,</L>
<L>Saving the Kingdom will deserve the Crown.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh my <HI>Aretus</HI> should I yield to this,</L>
<L>T'would then be my Ambition punish'd his:</L>
<L>And he's unfit a Tyrant to dethrone</L>
<L>Who with his Countreys ends dare mix his own;</L>
<L>Since <HI>Tryphon</HI> is call'd King, I'le rather bear</L>
<L>His Tyranny then be his Murtherer,</L>
<L>That name <HI>Aretus</HI> is a sacred thing.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>But <HI>Tryphon's</HI> an Usurper, not a King.</L>
<L>Ah shall he keep his blood from being spilt,</L>
<L>By taking off that name which makes his guilt:</L>
<L>If such a principle we should endure,</L>
<L>Then the most guilty would be most secure.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>What ever sins to gain a Crown are done,</L>
<L>The God's do pardon when they put it on.</L>
<L>We ought, when Heav'ns Vicegerent does a Crime,</L>
<L>To leave to Heav'n the right to punish him.</L>
<L>Those who for wrongs their Monarchs murther act,</L>
<L>Worse sins then they can punish they contract:</L>
<L>And while his favour I so much possess,</L>
<L>My Pow'r will hinder any new excess.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Are.</SPEAKER>
<L>But from new crimes while <HI>Tryphon</HI> you withhold,</L>
<L>You bribe our swords from punishing the old.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<L>He that's so bad as to gain pow'r by Blood,</L>
<L>Some reparation makes if he turn good;</L>
<L>And 'tis my hope as much as 'tis my care,</L>
<L>To fill his Court with those who virtuous are.</L>
<L>If Virtue in his Court it self advance,</L>
<L>Vice there will soon grow out of countenance.</L>
<L>That he no more into new crimes may fall,</L>
<L>Hee'll make this day <HI>Nicanor</HI> General;</L>
<L>And our <HI>Seleucus</HI> free from Vice as Fear</L>
<L>Shall head the guards—</L>
<STAGE>Tryphon, Nicanor, Seleucus. <HI>and</HI> Tryphon's <HI>Guards.</HI></STAGE>
<L>But <HI>Tryphon</HI> does appear</L>
<L>Who must not see me since he sent me now</L>
<L>On an affair which you at night shall know.</L>
<STAGE><HI>Demet.</HI> and <HI>Aret.</HI> go out several ways.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, no, <HI>Nicanor,</HI> I can truly own</L>
<L>My safety made me chiefly take the Crown;</L>
<L><HI>Antiochus</HI> had rais'd me to such height</L>
<L>As I had felt what was an Empire's weight,</L>
<L>And scarce th' Ambitious would be brought to reign</L>
<L>If with the Pomps of Pow'r they knew the Pain:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="38"/>
But when false doubts of me his mind did fill,</L>
<L>Then whom he Rais'd he had design'd to Kill:</L>
<L>And though the Father plac'd him in the Throne,</L>
<L>Yet this return he would have made the Son;</L>
<L>Finding that he or I must be opprest,</L>
<L>I of two evils did embrace the least;</L>
<L>Since to my Services he was severe,</L>
<L>From him what might not his best Subjects fear;</L>
<L>Which shows, my Countreys good in what was done</L>
<L>As much did urge me to it as my own.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nica.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sir, you have known me long, and that my heart</L>
<L>In what I speak disdains the vails of art:</L>
<L>If therefore you would now my silence break,</L>
<L>Be not offended if I freely speak.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nought you can say, such an offence will be,</L>
<L>As doubting freedom can be so to me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nica.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then Sir, my mind I'le freely speak to you</L>
<L>Yet with that reverence which to Kings is due.</L>
<L>I know your Fathers Valour, and your own</L>
<L>Did to <HI>Antiochus</HI> restore his Throne;</L>
<L>Since for your King you did that Service do,</L>
<L>Ah Sir, forget not 'twas your duty too:</L>
<L>Subjects, too oft, whose services are great</L>
<L>Consider that as merit, which is debt;</L>
<L>And have the ruine of their Kings design'd,</L>
<L>Judging them cruel when not over-kind:</L>
<L>Those are sad truths which Histories oft show,</L>
<L>Judge Sir if this has been your case, or no.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>I need n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> clearer proof to let you see</L>
<L>That once <HI>Antiochus</HI> was kind to me,</L>
<L>Then, when he alter'd and my murther meant,</L>
<L>I by his ruine could my own prevent:</L>
<L>To me his kindness he had largely shown,</L>
<L>Trusting me with a Pow'r above his own;</L>
<L>Had he but told me he'd that Power recall,</L>
<L>I at his feet would have resign'd it all;</L>
<L>But why because he rais'd me up so high</L>
<L>Should he conclude I merited to Die?</L>
<L>If he did erre, placing me where I stood,</L>
<L>Why must his fault be washt off with my Blood.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nica.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah Sir, though this had been the state of things,</L>
<L>Yet subjects, Sir, should die to save their Kings;</L>
<L>Much rather they their own death should endure</L>
<L>Then by their King's their Safety's to procure;</L>
<L>And Virtue does oblige us, where 'tis strong,</L>
<L>Rather to suffer then to act a wrong.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>But Natures Dictates which no man can wave</L>
<L>Obliges every one his Life to save.</L>
</SP>

Nica.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nature whose Dictates in defence you bring,</L>
<L>Ties subjects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>y their Deaths to save their King,</L>
<L>Nature is Reason, Sir, and that does show</L>
<L>More to our Kings then to ourselves we owe,</L>
<L>Form a subjects Death but one does fall,</L>
<L>But a King's Life contains the Life of All.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Seleu,</SPEAKER>
<L>Yet though your Safety, Sir, did you Incline</L>
<L>To Kill your King, you might have spar'd his Line,</L>
<L>Oh, Sir, you needed not their Bloods have spilt.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their Births to me <HI>Seleucus,</HI> made their Guilt,</L>
<L>Who his own Murther by his Monarch's Shuns,</L>
<L>Makes it more certain if he spares his Sons.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sel.</SPEAKER>
<L>But though to save the Sons unsafe was held,</L>
<L>Why was <HI>Antiochus</HI> the grandchild kill'd?</L>
<L>An Infant who was then not two years old?</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>Whatever of his Death my Foes have told,</L>
<L>Yet to you both here solemnly I Vow,</L>
<L>That child, for ought I know, is living now,</L>
<L>And one who oft informes me what is True</L>
<L>Tell's me▪ <HI>Nicanor,</HI> he's conceall'd by you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nica.</SPEAKER>
<L>I doe not doubt but many there may be,</L>
<L>Too apt to give ill Characters of me,</L>
<L>But, Sir, I think if you reflection make,</L>
<L>With what Affront the King from me did take</L>
<L>The Generals place, you'l scarce believe he durst</L>
<L>To one so wrong'd commit so great a Trust,</L>
<L>Yet if you think it true——</L>

<L>—————<HI>Nicanor</HI> hold,</L>
<L>'Tis not what I believe but what I'm told;</L>
<L>And to convince you what I say is true,</L>
<L>The Generals Office I restore to you;</L>
<L>If I to <HI>Syria</HI> meant not to be Just,</L>
<L>I would not lodge in you so great a Trust;</L>
<L>A Trust which if I use the <HI>Syrians</HI> ill,</L>
<L>Gives power to punish me, and Pow'r gives Will!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<L>That Trust which, Sir, you now on me would lay,</L>
<L>Does merit more then I have Pow'r to pay,</L>
<L>But when my King did wrong me, I did swear</L>
<L>No publick Office I again would bear,</L>
<L>Forgive me, Sir, since 'tis a Sacred Vow</L>
<L>Makes me decline what you have offer'd now,</L>
<L>I should for such a Trust appear unfit,</L>
<L>If I forswore my self accepting it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>Take heed, for if this Offer be refus'd,</L>
<L>I may believe you Justly are accus'd.</L>

<L>You should methinkss much rather, Sir, from thence</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Try.</SPEAKER>
<L>But if you would accept what I restore,</L>
<L>That Action would convince me of it more,</L>

<L>'Twould bind you too not to betray your Trust;</L>
<L>Yet I'l believe 'tis nothing but your Vow</L>

<L>And if you should dislike it now 'tis seen,</L>
<L>I pray how would you get it back again?</L>
<L>Since never yet at Law an Action lay</L>
<L>For Money paid to see a Cry'd-down-Play;</L>
<L>Then whatsoe'r it be, dispraise it not,</L>
<L>But doe as some when they a Clap have got;</L>
<L>Commend the Wench that more to her may goe,</L>
<L>Thus if they Ieer you, you may jeer them too;</L>
<L>New Playes, like Wives, are subject to the curse</L>
<L>Of being took for better or for worse.</L>
