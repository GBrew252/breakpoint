<HEAD>Act approving VIII generall Heads of
Doctrine against the Tenents of Erastia∣nisme,
Independencie, and Liberty of
Conscience, asserted in the CXI Proposi∣tions,
which are to be examined against the
next ASSEMBLY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Eing tender of so great an ingage∣ment
by solemn Covenant, sin∣cerely,
really, &amp; constantly to en∣deavour
in our Places &amp; Callings,
the preservation of the Reformed
Religion in this Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,
and Government, the Reformation of Religion in the
Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> in Doctrine Wor∣ship,
Discipline and Government, according to the
Word of God, and the example of the best Reformed
Kirks, and to endeavour the neerest Conjunction and
Uniformity in all these, together with the extirpation
of Heresie, Schisme, and whatsoever shall be found
contrary to sound Doctrine: And considering withall
that one of the special means which it becometh us in
our Places and Callings to use in pursuance of these
<PB REF="3"/>
ends, is in zeal for the true Reformed Religion, to
give our publick testimony against the dangerous te∣nents
of <HI>Erastianisme, Independency,</HI> and which is falsly
called <HI>Liberty of Conscience,</HI> which are not onely con∣trary
to sound Doctrine, but more speciall lets and
hinderances as well to the preservation of our own
received Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Govern∣ment,
as to the Work of Reformation and Uniformi∣ty
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Generall Assembly
upon these considerations, having heard publickly
read the CXI following Propositions exhibited and
tendered by some Brethren who were appointed to
prepare Articles or Propositions for the vindication
of the Truth in these particulars, Doth unanimously
approve and agree unto these eight generall Heads of
Doctrine therein contained and asserted. <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That
the Ministery of the Word, and the Administration
of the Sacraments of the New Testament, Baptisme
and the Lords Supper, are standing Ordinances insti∣tuted
by God himself, to continue in the Church to
the end of the world. 2. That such as administer the
Word and Sacraments▪ ought to be duely called and
ordained thereunto. 3. That some Ecclesiasticall
censures are proper and peculiar to be inflicted onely
upon such as bear Office in the Kirk; Other censures
are common, and may be inflicted both on Mini∣sters,
and other Members of the Kirk. 4. That the
censure of Suspension from the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, inflicted because of grosse ignorance,
or because of a scandalous life and conversation; As
likewise the censure of Excommunication, or casting
out of the Kirk flagitious or contumacious offenders,
<PB REF="3"/>
both the one censure and the other is warrantable by
and grounded upon the Word of God, and is ne∣cessary
(in respect of Divine institution) to be in the
Kirk. 5. That as the Rights, Power and Authori∣ty
of the Civill Magistrate are to be maintained ac∣cording
to the Word of God, and the Confessions
of the Faith of the Reformed Kirks, So it is no lesse
true and certain that Jesus Christ, the onely Head and
onely King of the Kirk, hath instituted and appoint∣ted
a Kirk Government distinct from the Civill Go∣vernment
or Magistracy. 6. That the Ecclesiasticall
Government is committed and intrusted by Christ to
the Assemblies of the Kirk, made up of the Ministers
of the Word and Ruling Elders. 7. That the lesser
and inferiour Ecclesiasticall Assemblies ought to be
subordinate and subject unto the greater and supe∣riour
Assemblies. 8. That notwithstanding hereof,
the Civill Magistrate may and ought to suppresse by
corporall or civill punishments, such as by spreading
Errour or Heresie, or by fomenting Schisme, great∣ly
dishonour God, dangerously hurt Religion, and
disturb the Peace of the Kirk, Which Heads of Do∣ctrine
(howsoever opposed by the authours and fo∣menters
of the foresaid Errours respectively) the
Generall Assembly doth firmly beleeve, own, main∣tain,
and commend unto others as solid, true, or∣thodox,
grounded upon the Word of God, conso∣nant
to the judgement both of the ancient, and the
best Reformed Kirks. And because this Assembly
(through the multitude of other necessary and pres∣sing
businesse) cannot now have so much leasure as
to examine and consider particularly the foresaid
<PB REF="4"/>
CXI Propositions: Therefore a more particular ex∣amination
thereof is committed and referred to the
Theologicall Faculties of the four Universities of
this Kingdom, and the judgement of each of these
Faculties concerning the same, is appointed to be re∣ported
to the next Generall Assembly. In the mean
while, these Propositions shall be printed, both that
Copies thereof may be sent to Presbyteries, and that
it may be free for any that pleaseth to peruse them,
and to make known or send their judgement concer∣ning
the same to the said next Assembly.</P>

PROPOSITIONS
Concerning
THE MINISTERIE
AND
GOVERNMENT
OF THE
CHURCH.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S our Lord Jesus Christ doth invisibly teach
and govern his Church by the Holy Spirit:
So in gathering, preserving, instructing, buil∣ding
and saving thereof, he useth Ministers as
his instruments, and hath appointed an order
of some to Teach, and others to Learne in
the Church, and that some should be the Flock, and others the
Pastours.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<P>For, beside these first Founders of the Church of Christ
extraordinarily sent, and furnished with the gift of Miracles,
whereby they might confirme the Doctrine of the Gospel, hee
appointed also ordinary Pastours and Teachers, for the exe∣cuting
of the Ministery, even untill his coming again nnto
Judgement, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4. 11, 12, 13. Wherefore, also as many as
are of the number of God's People, or will be accounted
Christians, ought to receive and obey the ordinary Ministers
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
of God's Word and Sacraments, (lawfully, though medi∣ately
called) as the Stewards and Ambassadours of Christ
himself.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<P>It is not lawfull for any man, how fit soever, and how
much soever enriched or beautified with excellent gifts, to un∣dertake
the Administration either of the Word or Sacraments
by the Will of private persons, or others who have not power
and right to Call; much lesse is it lawfull by their own judge∣ment
or arbitrement to assume and arrogate the same to them∣selves:
But before it be lawfull to undergoe that sacred Mi∣nistery
in Churches constituted, a speciall Calling; yea beside,
a lawfull Election (which alone is not sufficient) a Mission,
or sending, or (as commonly it is termed) Ordination, is
necessarily required, and that both for the avoyding of confu∣sion,
and to bar out, or shut the door (so far as in us lieth) up∣on
Impostors; as also by reason of divine Institution delivered
to us in the holy Scripture, <HI>Rom. 10. 15. Heb. 5. 4. Tit.</HI> 1 5.
1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 14.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<P>The Church ought to be governed by no other persons then
Ministers and Stewards preferred and placed by Christ, and
after no other manner then according to the Lawes made by
him; and therefore there is no power on earth which may
challenge to it self Authority or Dominion over the Church:
But whosoever they are that would have the things of Christ to
be administred not according to the Ordinance and will of
Christ revealed in his Word, but as it liketh them, and accor∣ding
to their own will and prescript, what other thing go they
about to do, then by horrible Sacriledge to throw down Christ
from his own Throne.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<P>For our onely Law-giver and Interpreter of his Fathers
will, Jesus Christ hath prescribed and fore-appointed the rule
according to which he would have his Worship and the Go∣vernment
of his own House to be ordered. To wrest this
rule of Christ laid open in his holy Word, to the Counsels,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Wills, Manners, Devices or Lawes of Men, is most hight im∣piety;
But contrarily, the Law of Faith commandeth the
counsell and purposes of men to be framed and conformed
to this rule, and overturneth all the reasonings of worldly
wisdome, and bringeth into captivity the thoughts of the
proud swelling minde to the obedience of Christ: Neither
ought the voice of any to take place or bee rested upon in the
Church, but the voice of Christ alone.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<P>The same Lord and our Saviour Jesus Christ, the onely Head
of the church hath ordained in the New Testament, not only
the Preaching of the Word and Administration of Baptisme
and the Lords Supper, but also Ecclesiasticall Government,
distinct and differing from the Civill Government, and it is
his will that there be such a Government distinct from the Ci∣vill
in all his Churches everywhere, as well those which live
under Christian, as those under indfiell Magistrates, even un∣till
the end of the World. <HI>Heb. 13. 7. 17. 1 Tim.</HI> 5. 17, 19.
<HI>Rom. 12. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. 1 Thes. 5. 12, Acts 1. 20, 28. Luke</HI> 12.
42. 1 <HI>Tim. 6. 14. Apoc.</HI> 2. 25.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<P>This Ecclesiasticall Government distinct from the Civill,
is from God committed, not to the whole body of the Church
or Congregation of the faithfull, or to be Exercised both by
Officers and People, but to the Ministers of Gods Word, to∣gether
with the Elders which are joyned with them for the
care and Government of the Church, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 17. To these
therefore who are over the Church in the Lord, belongeth
the Authority and Power, and it lyeth upon them by their of∣fice,
according to the rule of Gods Word to discerne and
judge betwixt the Holy and Prophane, to give diligence for
amendment of delinquents, and to purge the Church (as
much as is in them) from scandalls, and that not onely by en∣quiring,
inspection, warning, reproving, and more sharply
expostulating, but also by acting in the further and more
severe parts of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, or exercising
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Ecclesiastick jurisdiction, even unto the greatest and weighti∣est
censures, where need is.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="8" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>8.</HEAD>
<P>None that is within the Church ought to be without the
reach of Church Law, and exempt from Ecclesiastick Cen∣su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es;
but Discipline is to be exercised on all the Members
of the Church, without respect or consideration of those ad∣hering
qualities which use to commend a man to other men;
such as Power, Nobility, illustrious Descent, and the like:
for the judgement cannot be right, where men are led and
moved with these considerations. Wherefore, let respect of
Persons be farre from all Judges, chiefly the Ecclesiasticall:
And if any in the Church doe so swell in pride, that he refuse
to be under this Discipline, and would have himself to be free
and exempt from all trial and Ecclesiastick judgement, this
mans disposition is more like the haughtinesse of the Roman
Pope, then the meeknesse and submissivenesse of Christs
Sheep.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="9" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>9.</HEAD>
<P>Ecclesiasticall Censure moreover is either proper to be
inflicted upon the Ministers and Office-bearers onely, or with
them common to other Members of the Church; the for∣mer
consisteth in Suspension or Deposition of Ministers from
their Office (which in the ancient Canons is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
The latter consisteth in the greater and lesser Excommunica∣tion,
(as they speak.) Whatsoever in another Brother de∣serveth
Excommunication, the same much more in a Mini∣ster
deserveth Excommunication: But justly sometimes a
Minister is to be put from his Office, and deprived of that
Power which by Ordination was given him, against whom
neverthelesse to draw the sword of Excommunication, no rea∣son
doth compell.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>10.</HEAD>
<P>Sometime also it happeneth that a Minister having fallen
into Heresie or Apostasie, or other grievous crimes, if hee
shew tokens of true repentance, may be justly received in∣to
the communion of the Church; Whom notwithstanding,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is no way expedient to restore into his former place or
charge; yea, perhaps it will not be found fit to restore such a
one to the Ministery in another Congregation, as soone as he
is received into the bosome of the Church; Which surely is
most agreeable as well as to the Word of God, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 23 9.
<HI>Ezech.</HI> 44. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. as to that Ecclesiasticall Disci∣pline,
which in some ages after the times of the Apostles was
in use.</P>
<P>So true is it that the Ministers of the Church, are lyable as
well to peculiar as to common censures; Or that a Minister of
the Church is censured one way, and one of the people ano∣ther
way.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>11.</HEAD>
<P>Ecclesiasticall censure, which is not proper to Ministers,
but common to them with other Members of the Church, is
either suspension from the Lords Supper, (which by others is
called the Publicanes Excommunication,) or the cutting off
of a Member, which is commonly called Excommunication.
The distinction of this twofold censure (commonly, though
not so properly passing under the name of the lesser and grea∣ter
Excommunication) is not onely much approved by the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Synode now assembled at <HI>West∣minster,</HI>
but also by the Reformed Churches of <HI>France,</HI> the
Low-countreys, and of <HI>Pole-land,</HI> as is to be seen in the <HI>book
of the Ecclesiastick Discipline of the Reformed Churches in
France. Chap. 5. Art. 9. In the harmonie of the Belgicke
Synodes. Chap. 14. Art.</HI> 8. 9. In the Canons of the generall
Synode of <HI>Torne,</HI> held in the yeare 1597.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="12" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>12</HEAD>
<P>That the distinction of that twofold Church censure was al∣lowed
also by antiquity, it may be sufficiently clear to him who
will consult the sixtie one Canon of the sixth generall Synode,
with the Annotations of <HI>Zonaras</HI> and <HI>Balsomon;</HI> also the
thirteenth Canon of the eighth Synode (which is termed the
first and second) with the Notes of <HI>Zonaras;</HI> Yea besides,
even the penitents also themselves of the fourth degree, or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, which were in the <HI>consistency,</HI> were
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
suspended from the Lords Supper, though as to other things
of the same condition with the faithfull; For to the commu∣nion
also of Prayers, and so to all priviledges of Ecclesiasticall
society, the Eucharist alone excepted, they were thought to
have right: So sacred a thing was the Eucharist esteemed. See
also beside others, <HI>Cyprian 1. Book. Epist.</HI> 11. That <HI>Dyonisius</HI>

Strabo of Ecclesiasticall matters. Chap.</HI> 17.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="13" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>13.</HEAD>
<P>That first and lesser censure by Christs ordinance, is to be
inflicted on such as have received Baptisme, and pretend to be
true Members of the church, yet are found unfit and unwor∣thy
to communicate in the signes of the grace of Christ with
the church, whether for their grosse ignorance of divine
things, the Law namely and Gospell, or by reason of scan∣dall
either of false Doctrine or wicked life. For these causes
therefore, or for some one of them, they are to be kept back
from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper (a lawfull judiciall
tryall going before) according to the interdiction of Christ,
forbidding that that which is Holy be given to dogs, or Pearles
bee cast before swine, <HI>Matth</HI> 7. 6. and this censure of suspensi∣on
is to continue, till the offenders bring forth fruits worthy
of repentance.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="14" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>14.</HEAD>
<P>For the asserting and defending of this suspension, there
is no small accession of strength from the nature of the Sacra∣ment
it self, and the institution and end thereof. The Word
of God indeed is to be Preached, as well to the ungodly and
impenitent that they may be converted, as to the Godly and
repenting, that they may be confirmed: But the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper is by God instituted, not for beginning
the Work of Grace, but for nourishing and increasing Grace,
and therefore none is to be admitted to the Lords Supper, who
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
by his life testifieth that he is impenitent, and not as yet con∣verted.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="15" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>15.</HEAD>
<P>Indeed if the Lord had instituted this Sacrament, that
not onely it should nourish and cherish faith, and seal the pro∣mises
of the Gospell, but also should begin the work of Grace
in sinners, and give regeneration it self, as the instrumentall
cause thereof, verily even the most wicked, most uncleane
and most unworthy were to be admitted. But the Reformed
Churches do otherwise judge of the nature of this Sacrament,
which shall be abundantly manifest by the gleaning of these
following Testimonies.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="16" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>16.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The</HI> Scottosh <HI>Confession,</HI> Art. 23. But we confesse that the
Lords Supper belongs onely to those of the houshold of faith,
who can try and examine themselves, as well in faith, as in the
duties of faith towards their neighbours. Whoso abide without
faith, and in variance with their brethren, doe at that holy
Table eate and drinke unworthily. Hence it is that the Pa∣stors
in our Church doe enter on a publike and particular exami∣nation,
both of the knowledge, conversation and life of those
who are to be admitted to the Lords Table. The Belgick <HI>Con∣fession.</HI>
Art. 35. We beleevs also and confesse that our Lord
Jesus Christ hath ordained the holy Sacrament of his Supper,
that in it he may nourish and uphold them whom he hath already
regenerated.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="17" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>17.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The</HI> Saxon <HI>Confession.</HI> Art. 15. <HI>of the Lords Supper.</HI> The
Lord willeth that every receiver be particularly confirmed by
this testimony, so that he may be certified that the benefits of
the Gospel doe appertaine to himself, seeing the Preaching is
common, and by this testimony, by this receiving, he sheweth
that thou art one of his members, and washed with his blood. <HI>And
by and by.</HI> Thus therefore we instruct the Church, that it be∣hooveth
them that come to the supper, to bring with them re∣pentance
or conversion, and (faith being now kindled in the
meditation of the death and resurrection, and the benefits of the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Son of God) to seek here the confirmation of this faith. <HI>The
very same things are set downe, and that in the very same
words in the consent of the Churches of</HI> Pole-land <HI>in the</HI> Sen∣dominian
<HI>Synode,</HI> Anno 1570. Art. of the Lords Supper,</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="18" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>18.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The</HI> Bohemian <HI>Confession.</HI> Art. 11. Next our Divines
teach that the Sacraments of themselves, or as some say, <HI>ex
opere operato,</HI> doe not confer Grace to those, who are not first
endued with good motions, and inwardly quickened by the Holy
Spirit, neither doe they bestow justifying faith, which maketh
the soule of man in all things obsequious, trusting and obedient
to God; for faith must goe before (wee speake of them of
ripe yeares) which quickeneth a man by the work of the Ho∣ly
Spirit, and putting good motions into the heart. <HI>And after:</HI>
But if any come unworthily to the Sacraments, he is not made
by them worthy or cleane, but doth only bring greater sinne and
damnation on himself.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="19" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>19.</HEAD>
<P>Seeing then in the holy Supper, that is in the receiving the
Sacramentall Elements (which is here distinguished from
the Prayers and Exhortations accompanying that action) the
benefits of the Gospell are not first received, but for them being
received are thanks given; neither by partaking thereof doth
God bestow the very spirituall life, but doth preserve, cherish
and perfect that life; and seeing the Word of God is accoun∣ted
in the manner of letters patents, but Sacraments like seals,
(as rightly the <HI>Helvetian</HI> Confession faith, Chap. 19) it
plainely followeth that those are to be kept back from the Lords
Supper, which by their fruits and manners doe prove them∣selves

knows not that the vassals of Antichrist have drawn the
Lords Supper into the worst and most pernicious abuses, as also
the Ordination of Ministers, and other Ordinances of the Gos∣pel?

there is another and different consideration to be had; for be∣sides
that it would be a great inconvenience that plaintifes, per∣sons
accused, and witnesses be drawne from the most remote
Churches, to the generall or universall Counsell; the visible
communion it selfe of all the Churches (on which the universal
Counsel is built, and whereupon as on a foundation it leaneth)
is not so much of company, fellowship, or conversation, as of
Religion and Doctrine. All true Churches of the World doe
indeed professe the same true Religion and faith; but there is
beside this a certaine commixture and conjunction of the
Churches of the same Nation, as to a more near fellowship,

lawfully constituted Synod, and from the Nationall to the
Occumenicall Synod (when there is a just and weighty
cause) an appeal is open: So there is no need that the Ap∣peals
of them who complain of injury done to them through
the exercise of Discipline in this or that Church, should goe
beyond the bounds of the Nationall Synod: But 'tis most a∣greeable
to reason that they should rest and acquiesce within
those bounds and borders; and that the ultimate judgement of
such matters be in the Nationall Synod, unlesse the thing it
self be so hard, and of so great moment, that the knot be justly
thought worthy of a greater decider: In which case the con∣troversie

appointed as well to the manifestation of his owne glory, as
to the singular profit of mankinde: and withall, that by rea∣son
of the will of God himself revealed in his Word, wee

how much soever hurtfull and pernicious enemies to true Re∣ligion

</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="43" TYPE="proposition">

<P>Yet the civill Power and the ecclesiasticall ought not by
any means to be confounded or mixed together: Both Pow∣ers
are indeed from God, and ordained for his glory, and both
to be guided by his word, and both are comprehended under
that precept, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother:</HI> So that men
ought to obey both civill Magistrates and ecclesiasticall gover∣nours
in the Lord; To both powers their proper dignity and
authority is to be maintained and preserved in force: To both
also is some way entrusted the keeping of both Tables of the
Law; also both the one and the other doth exercise some juris∣diction,
and giveth sentence of Judgement in an externall court
or judicatory: But these, and other things of like sort, in
which they agree notwithstanding; yet by marvellous vaste
differences are they distinguished the one from the other, and
the rights of both remain distinct, and that eight manner of
wayes, which it shall not be amisse here to adde, that unto each

maintained.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="44" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>44.</HEAD>
<P>First of all therefore they are differenced the one from the
other in respect of the very foundation and the instituti∣on:
For the politicall or civill Power is grounded upon the
Law of Nature it selfe, and for that cause it is common to In∣fidels
with Christians: the Power ecclesiasticall dependeth
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>
immediatly upon the positive Law of Christ alone, that belong∣eth
to the Universall Dominion of God the creator over all Na∣tions;
but this unto the speciall and Occonomicall Kingdom of
Christ the Mediator, which he exerciseth in the church alone,
and which is not of this World.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="45" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>45.</HEAD>
<P>The second difference is in the object, or matter about
which: The power politick or civill is occupied about the out∣ward
man, and civill or earthly things, about Warre, Peace,
conservation of Justice, and good order in the Common-wealth;
also about the outward businesse or externall things of the
Church, which are indeed necessary to the church, or profita∣ble,
as touching the outward man, yet not properly and purely
spirituall, for they doe not reach unto the soule, but onely to the
externall state and condition of the Ministers and Members of
the Church.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="46" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>46.</HEAD>
<P>For the better understanding whereof, tis to be observed
that so farre as the Ministers and Members of the Church are
Citizens, Subjects, or Members of the Common-wealth, it is
in the power of the Magistrate, to judge, determine and give
sentence concerning the disposing of their bodies or goods; As
also concerning the maintenance of the poore, sick, the ba∣nished,
and of others in the church which are afflicted; To
regulate (so far as concerneth the civill order) Marriages,
Burials, and other circumstances which are common both to
holy, and also to honest civill societies; to afford places fit
for holy Assemblies and other externall helps by which the
sacred matters of the Lord may be more safely, commodious∣ly,
and more easily in the church performed: To remove the
externall impediments of divine worship or of Ecclesiasticall
Peace, and to represse those which exalt themselves against
the true Church and her Ministers, and doe raise up trouble a∣gainst
them.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="47" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>47</HEAD>
<P>The matter may further be thus illustrated: There is al∣most
the like respect and confideration of the Magistrate as he
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>
is occupied about the outward things of the church, and of
the Ecclesiastick Ministery as it is occupied about the inward
or spirituall part of civill Government, that is about those
things which in the government of the common-wealth be∣long
to the conscience. It is one thing to governe the com∣mon-wealth,
and to make politicall and civill Lawes; ano∣ther
thing to interpret the Word of God, and out of it to

that the Magistrate as being Gods Minister may by this guiding

properly to treat of civill businesses, but of the scandalls

both to establish the Rights and Liberties of Synods assem∣bling
together, at times appointed by the known and recei∣ved
Law, and to indict and gather together Synods occasio∣nally,
as often as the necessity of the Church shall require
the same; Not that all or any power to consult or determine

<P>So that the Magistrate calleth together Synods, not as

of the things which are common to Synods with other

are Assemblies in the name of Christ, to treat of matters spi∣rituall,
but as they are publick Assemblies within his Territo∣ries;
for to the end that publick conventions may be kept in
any Territorie, the licence of the Lord of that place ought to
be desired. In Synods therefore a respect of order, as well
civill as ecclesiasticall is to be had; And because of this Ci∣vill

are the preaching of the Word, the Administration of

not as they are Spirituall and Evangelicall Ordinances piercing

</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="58" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>58.</HEAD>
<P>Thirdly, Those powers are differences in respect of their
formes, and that three wayes: For first the civill Power, al∣though
in respect of God it bee Ministeriall, yet in respect of the
Subjects it is Lordly and Magisteriall. Ecclesiasticall power is
indeed furnished with authority, yet that authority is liker the
Fatherly then the Kingly authority; Yea also tis purely Ministe∣riall,
much lesse can it be lawfull to Ministers of the Church to
bear dominion over the flock.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="59" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>59.</HEAD>
<P>Emperors, Kings and other Magistrats are indeed appointed
fathers of they countrey, but the are withall Lords of their
People and Subjects; Not as if it were permitted to them to
bear rule and command at their owne will and as they list (for
they are the Ministers of God for the good and profit of the
Subjects) yet it belongs to their power truely and properly to
exercise dominion, to hold principality, to proceed imperi∣ously.
It is indeed the duety of Ministers and Rulers of the
Church to oversee, to feed as shepherds, to correct and re∣ctifie,
to bear the keyes, to be Stewards in the house of Christ,
but in no wise to be Lords over the house, or to governe as
Lords, or Lordlike to rule; yea in brief, this is the difference be∣tween
the civill Magistrate and the Ecclesiasticall Ministery,
in respect of those that are committed to their trust, that the lot
of the former is to be served or ministred unto, the lot of the
latter to minister or serve.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="60" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>60.</HEAD>
<P>Now we have one onely Lord which governes our souls,
neither is it competent to man, but to God alone to have pow∣er
and authority over consciences. But the Lord hath appoin∣ted
his owne Stewards over his owne Family, that according
to his commandment they may give to every one their allow∣ance
or portion, and to dispense his mysteries faithfully; and
to them hee hath delivered the keyes, or power of letting in in∣to
his house, or excluding out of his house those whom he him∣self
will have let in or shut out. <HI>Matth.</HI> 16. 19. and 18. 18. <HI>Luk.</HI>
12. 42. 1 <HI>Cor. 4. 1. Tit.</HI> 1. 7.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="61" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>61.</HEAD>
<P>Next, the civill power is indued with authority of com∣pelling;
But it belongs not to the Ministery to compell the
disobedient; if any compulsion be in or about Eclesissticall
matters, tis adventitious from without, to wit, from the
help and assistance of the Magistrate, not from the nature of
Ecclesiasticall power, from which it is very heterogenous;
and therefore if any Suspended or Excommunicate persons
should be found, who shall be so stiffe-necked, and so impudent
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>
that at once he cast off all shame, and make no account at all
of those censures, but scorn or contemn the same, or perad∣venture
shall insolently or proudly engyre and obtrude himself
upon the Sacrament, or being also filled with divelish malice,
do more and more contradict and blaspheme; the ecclesiasti∣call
Ministry in such cases hath nothing more to do by way of
jurisdiction: But the Magistrate hath in readinesse a compel∣ling
jurisdiction and externall force, whereby such stubborn, re∣bellious
and undaunted pride may be externally repressed.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="62" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>62.</HEAD>
<P>Last of all, the power of the Magistrate worketh onely
politically or civilly, according to the nature of the Scepter
or Sword, maketh and guardeth civill Lawes, which some∣times
also hee changeth or repealeth, and other things of that
kinde hee eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cteth with a secular power: But the ecclesiasti∣call
power dealeth spiritually, and onely in the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and by authority entrusted or received from
him alone: neither is it exercised without prayer or calling on
the Name of God: nor lastly, doth it use any other then spiritu∣all
weapons.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="63" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>63.</HEAD>
<P>The same sinne therefore in the same man may be punished
one way by the civill, another way by the ecclesiasticall
Power; By the civill Power under the formality of a crime,
with corporall or pecuniary punishment: By the ecclesiasti∣call
Power, under the notion or nature of scandall, with a
spirituall censure; even as also the same civill question is one
way deliberate upon and handled by the Magistrate in the Se∣nate
or place of Judgement; another way by the Minister of
the Church, in the Presbytery or Synod: By the Magistrate,
so farre as it pertaineth to the Government of the Common-wealth;
by the Minister, so far as it respects the conscience;
for the ecclesiastiall Ministery also is exercised about civil
things spiritually, in so far as it teacheth and admonisheth the
Magistrate out of the Word of God what is best and most ac∣ceptable
unto God; or as it reproveth freely unjust judgements,
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>
unjust wars, and the like, and out of the Scripture threatneth
the wrath of God to be revealed against all unrighteousness of
men: So also is the Magistrate said to be occupied civilly about
spiritual things.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="64" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>64.</HEAD>
<P>Therefore all the actions of the civill Magistrate, even
when he is imployed about Ecclesiasticall matters, are of their
own nature, and essentially, civill. He punisheth externally I∣dolaters,
Blasphemers, Sacrilegious persons, Hereticks, Pro∣phaners
of holy things, and according to the nature and mea∣sure
of the sin, he condemneth to death or banishment, forfei∣ture
of goods, or imprisonment: he guardeth and under∣proppeth
Ecclesiasticall Canons with civill authority, giveth
a place of habitation to the Church in his territory, restrain∣eth
or expelleth the insolent and untamed disturbers of the
Church.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="65" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>65.</HEAD>
<P>He taketh care also for maintaining the Ministers and
Schools, and supplyeth the temporall necessities of Gods Ser∣vants,
by his command assembleth Synods, when there is need
of them: and summoneth, calleth out, and draws to tryall the
unwilling, which without the Magistrates strength and autho∣rity
cannot be done, as hath bin already said: he maketh Sy∣nods
also safe and secure, and in a civil way presideth or mode∣rateth
in them (if it so seem good to him) either by himself, or
by a substitute Commissioner. In all which the power of the
Magistrate, though occupied about spirituall things, is not, for
all that, spiritual but civill.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="66" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>66.</HEAD>
<P>Fourthly, they differ in the end: The immediate, nearest end
of civil power, is, that the good of the Common-wealth may
be provided for and procured, whether it be in time of Peace,
according to the rules of Law and counsel of Judges; or in
time of War, according to the rules of Military prudence: and
so the temporall safety of the Subjects may be procured, and
that external Peace and civil Liberty may be preserved, and be∣ing
lost, may be again restored.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="67" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>
<HEAD>67.</HEAD>
<P>But the chiefest and last end of civill Government is, the
glory of God the Creator, namely, that those which do evil, be∣ing
by a superior power restrained or punished, and those which
do good, getting praise of the same, the subjects so much the more
may shun impiety and injustice: and that Vertue, Justice and the
Morall Law of God (as touching those eternal duties of both
Tables, unto which all the posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> are obliged) may
remain in strength, and flourish,</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="68" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>68.</HEAD>
<P>But whereas the Christian Magistrate doth wholly devote
himself to the promoting of the Gospel and Kingdom of Christ,
and doth direct and bend all the might and strength of his au∣thority
to that end: This proceedeth not from the nature of his
office and function, which is common to him with an Infidell
Magistrate; but from the influence of his common Christian
calling into his particular vocation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="69" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>69.</HEAD>
<P>For every member of the Church (and so also the faithful and
godly Magistrate) ought to referr and order his particular vo∣cation,
faculty, ability, power and honour to this end, that the
Kingdom of Christ may be propagated and promoted, and
the true Religion be cherished and defended: So that the
advancement of the Gospell, and of all the Ordinances of the
Gospell, is indeed the end of the godly Magistrate: not of
a Magistrate simply; or (if ye will rather) tis not the end
of the office it self, but of him who doth execute the same pi∣ously.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="70" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>70.</HEAD>
<P>But the end of Ecclesiastical power, yea the end as well
of the Ministry it self, as of the godly Minister, is, that the King∣dom
of Christ may be set forward, that the pathes of the
Lord be made straight, that his holy mysteries may be
kept pure, that stumbling-blocks may be removed out of the
Church, least a little leaven leaven the whole lump; or
least one sick or scabbed sheep infect the whole flock; that the
faithfull may so walk as it becometh the Gospell of Christ,
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>
and that the wandring sheep of Christ may be converted and
brought back to the sheep-Fold:</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="71" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>71.</HEAD>
<P>And seeing this power is given of the Lord, not to destructi∣on
but to edification; Therefore this same scope is propounded
in Excommunication, (which is the greatest and last of Ecclesi∣astical
censures) namely, that the soul of an offending brother
may be gained to Christ, and that being stricken with fear,
and the stubborn sinner filled with shame, may by the grace of
God be humbled, and may (as a brand plucked out of the fire)
be snatched out of the snare of the Devill, and may repent unto
salvation; at least, the rest may turn away from those which are
branded with such a censure, least the soul infection do creep
and spread further.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="72" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>72.</HEAD>
<P>Fiftly, they are distinguished by the effect. The effect of civil
power is either proper or by way of redundance: The proper
effect is the safety temporal of the Common-wealth, externall
tranquillity, the fruition of civil Liberty, and of all things which
are necessary to the civil Society of men. The effect, by way of
redundance, is the good of the Church, to wit, in so far as by ex∣ecution
of Justice and good Laws, some impediments that usu∣ally
hinder and disturb the course of the Gospel, are avoided or
taken away.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="73" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>73.</HEAD>
<P>For by how much the more faithfully the Magistrate exe∣cuteth
his office in punishing the wicked, and cherishing and
encouraging good men, taking away those things which
withstand the Gospell, and punishing or driving away the
troublers and subverters of the Church; so much the more the
orthodox Faith and Godlyness are reverenced and had in esti∣mation,
sins are hated and feared: Finally, and all the sub∣jects
contained (as much as concerneth the outward man)
within the lists of Gods Law: Whence also by consequence
in happeneth, by Gods blessing, that the Church is desiled
with fewer scandalls, and doth obtain the more freedom and
Peace.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="74" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>74.</HEAD>
<P>But the proper effect of the Ecclesiasticall power, or keys
of the Kingdom of Heaven is wholly spirituall; for the act
of binding and loosing, of retaining and remitting sins, doth
reach to the soul and conscience it self (which cannot be said
of the act of the civill power:) And as unjust Excommunica∣tion
is void, so Ecclesiasticall censure being inflicted by the Mi∣nisters
of Christ, and his Stewards, according to his will, is ra∣tified
in Heaven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. 18. and therefore ought to be estee∣med
and acknowledged in like manner as inflicted by Christ
himself.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="75" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>75.</HEAD>
<P>Sixthly, they are also differenced in respect of the Subject:
The politick power is committed sometimes to one, sometimes
to more, sometime by right of election, sometime by right of
succession: But the Ecclesiasticall power is competent to none
under the New Testament by the right of succession, but he
who hath it, must be called, by God and the Church, to it; nei∣ther
was it given by Christ to one, either Pastor or Elder, much
less to a Prelate, but <HI>to the Church,</HI> that is, to the consistory of
Presbyters. 'Tis confessed indeed, and who can be ignorant of
it, that the power (as they call it) of <HI>order,</HI> doth belong to par∣ticular
Ministers, and is by each of them apart lawfully exerci∣sed?
but that power which is commonly called of jurisdiction,
is committed not to one, but to the unity, that is, to a consisto∣ry;
therefore Ecclesiasticall censure ought not to be inflicted,
but <HI>by many. 2 Cor.</HI> 2. 6.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="76" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>76.</HEAD>
<P>Seventhly, they differ as touching the correlative: God
hath commanded, that unto the civil power, every soul, or all
Members of the Common-wealth, of what condition and estate
soever, be subiect; for what have we to do with the Papists,
who wil have them, whom they call the Clergy or Ecclesiasti∣call
persons, to be free from the yoke of the civill Magistrate?
The Ecclesiasticall power extends it self to none other subiects,
then unto those which are called Brethren, or Members of the
Church.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="77" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>77.</HEAD>
<P>Eightly, there remaineth another difference in respect of
the distinct and divided exercise of authority. For either
power ceasing from its duty, or remitting punishment, that
doth not (surely it ought not) prejudice the exercise of the
other power; namely, if the Magistrate cease to do his duty,
or do neglect to punish with secular punishment, those male∣factors
which by profession are Church Members: Neverthe∣less,
it is in the power of the Governors of the Church, by the
bridle of Ecclesiastical Discipline, to curb such men; yea also,
by vertue of their office they are bound to do it; and on the
other part, the Magistrate may, and ought to punish in life and
limb, honours or goods, notwithstanding the offenders re∣pentance,
or reconciliation with the Church.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="78" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>78.</HEAD>
<P>Therefore the one sword being put up in the scabbard, it
is free, and often necessary to draw the other. Neither power
is bound to cast out, or receive him, whom the other doth cast
forth or receive: The reason whereof is, because the Eccle∣siastical
Ministry doth chiefly respect the repentance to sal∣vation,
and gaining of the sinners soul; wherefore it also im∣braceth
all kind of wicked men repenting, and receiveth
them into the bosome of the Church. The Magistrate pro∣poseth
to himself another, and much differing scope; for e∣ven
repenting offenders are by him punished, both that Ju∣stice
and the Laws may be satisfied, as also to terrifie others;
hence it is, that absolution from Ecclesiastick censure, freeth
not at all the Delinquent, from civill Judgment, and that ex∣ternal
sword.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="79" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>79.</HEAD>
<P>Seeing then there are so many and so great differences of
both Offices, and seeing also, that the function of Ministers and
Elders of the Church, is not at all contained in the office of
the Magistrate; neither on the other part, this is comprehended
within that; Magistrates shal no less sin in usurping Eccle∣siastical
power, ministring holy things, ordaining Ministers,
or exercising Discipline Ecclesiasticall, then Ministers should
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>
sin in rushing into the borders of the Magistrate, and in thru∣sting
themselves into his calling.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="80" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>80.</HEAD>
<P>Neither are those powers more mingled one with other, or
less distinguished, where the Magistrate is a Christian, then
where he is an Infidell; For, as in a believing Father and in an
Infidel Father, the rights of a Father are the same, so in a Chri∣stian
Magistrate, and in an Infidell Magistrate, the rights of Ma∣gistrates
are the same: So that to the Magistrate converted
to the Christian Faith, there is no accession of new right, or in∣crease
of civil power, although being indued with true Faith
and Piety, he is made more fit and willing to the undergoing of
his office and the doing of his duty.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="81" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>81.</HEAD>
<P>So then the Word of God and the Law of Christ, which by
so evident difference, separateth and distinguisheth Ecclesiasti∣cal
Government from the Civill, forbiddeth the Christian Ma∣gistrate
to enter upon, or usurp the Ministry of the Word and
Sacraments, or the juridicall dispensing of the keys of the King∣dom
of Heaven, to invade the Church-Government, or to chal∣lenge
to himself the right of both swords, spirituall and corpo∣ral:
But if any Magistrate (which God forbid) should dare
to arrogate to himself so much, and to enlarge his skirts so far,
the Church shal then straight way be constrained to complain
justly, and cry out, that though the Pope is changed, yet Pope∣dom
remaineth still.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="82" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>82.</HEAD>
<P>It is unlawfull moreover to a Christian Magistrate, to with∣stand
the practise and execution of Ecclesiasticall Discipline,
(whether it be that which belongs to a particular Church, or
the matter be carryed to a Class or Synode:) Now the Magi∣strate
withstandeth the Ecclesiastick Discipline, either by pro∣hibitions
and uniust Laws, or by his evil example, stirring up,
and inciting others to the contempt thereof, or to the tram∣pling
it under foot.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="83" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>83.</HEAD>
<P>Surely the Christian Magistrate (if any time he give
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>
any grievous scandall to the Church,) seeing he also is a mem∣ber
of the Church, ought no ways disdain to submit himself to
the power of the keys; Neither is this to be marvelled at: for
even as the office of the Minister of the Church is no ways sub∣ordinate
and subjected to the civil power, but the person of the
Minister, as he is a member of the Common-wealth, is subject
thereto: So the civil power it self, or the Magistrate, as a Ma∣gistrate,
is not subjected to Ecclesiastick power; yet that man
who is a Magistrate ought (as he is a member of the Church)
to be under the Churches censure of his manners, after the ex∣ample
of the Emperour <HI>Theodosius,</HI> unless he wil despise and
set at nought Ecclesiastick Discipline, and indulge the swelling
pride of the flesh.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="84" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>84.</HEAD>
<P>If any man should again object that the Magistrate is not
indeed to resist Ecclesiasticall Government, yet that the abuses
thereof are to be corrected and taken away by him: The an∣swer
is ready, in the worst and troublesome times, or in the
decayed and troubled estate of things, when the ordinance of
God in the Church, is violently turned into tyranny, to the
treading down of true Religion, and to the oppressing of the
Professors thereof, and when nothing almost is sound or
whole, divers things are yielded to be lawfull to godly Magi∣strates,
which are not ordinarily lawfull for them, that so to ex∣traordinary
diseases, extraordinary remedies may be applyed.
So also the Magistrate abusing his power unto tyranny, and ma∣king
havock of all, tis lawfull to resist him by some extraordi∣nary
ways and means, which are not ordinarily to be al∣lowed.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="85" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>85.</HEAD>
<P>Yet ordinarily and by common or known Law and Right
in settled Churches, if any man have recourse to the Magistrate
to complain, that through abuse of Ecclesiastick Discipline,
injury is done to him, or if any sentence of the Pastors and
Elders of the Church, whether concerning Faith or Disci∣pline,
do displease or seem uniust unto the Magistrate himself;

<P>What then? Shall it be lawful ordinarily for Ministers and
Elders to do what they list, or shall the Governors in the Chur∣ches,
glorying in the Law, by their transgression dishonour
God? God forbid. For first, if they shall trespass in any thing
against the Magistrate or municipal Laws, whether by inter∣medling
in judging of civil causes, or otherwise disturbing the
peace and order of the Common-wealth, they are liable to civil
tryal and judgments, as it is in the power of the Magistrate to
restrain and punish them.</P>

<P>Again it hath been before shewed, that to Ecclesiastical evils
Ecclesiastical remedies are appointed and fitted, for the Church
is no less then the Common-wealth, through the grace of
God, sufficient to it self in reference unto her own end: and
as in the Common-wealth, so in the Church, the errour of
inferior judgments and Assemblies, or their evil Govern∣ment,
is to be corrected by superior judgments and Assem∣blies,
and so still by them of the same order, lest one order
be confounded with another, or one Government be inter∣mingled
with another Government. What shall now the ad∣versaries
of Ecclesiastical power object here, which those who
admit not the yoke of the Magistrate may not be ready in like
manner to transfer against the civil Judicatories and Govern∣ment
of the Common-wealth? Seeing it happeneth sometimes
that the Common-wealth is no less ill Governed then the
Church.</P>

<P>If any man shall prosecute the argument, and say, that yet
no remedy is here shewed, which may be applyed to the
injustice or error of a National Synod: surely he stumbleth
against the same stone, seeing he weigheth not the matter with
an equal ballance; for the same may in like sort fall back
and be cast upon Parliaments, or any supream Senate of a
Common-wealth: for who seeth not the judgment of the
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>
supream civill Senate to be nothing more infallible, yea also in
matters of Faith and Ecclesiasticall Discipline, more apt and
prone to Error (as being less accustomed to sacred Studies)
then the judgment of the Nationall Synod? what medicines
then, or what soveraign plaisters shal be had, which may be
fit for the curing and healing of the Errors and miscariages of
the supream Magistrate and Senate? The very like, and be∣side
all this, other and more effectuall medicines, by which
the Errors of Nationall Synods may be healed, are possible
to be had.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="89" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>89.</HEAD>
<P>There wanteth not a Divine Medicine, and Soveraign
Balm in Gilead; for although the Popish opinion of the in∣fallibility
of Counsels, be worthily rejected and exploded;
yet tis not in vain that Christ hath promised, he shal be pre∣sent
with an Assembly, which in deed and in truth, meeteth
together in his Name; with such an Assembly, verily he useth
to be present by a spirituall aide and assistance of his own Spi∣rit,
to uphold the falling, or to raise up the fallen. Whence it
is, that divers times the Errors of former Synods are discove∣red
and amended by the latter: sometimes also the second, or
after thoughts of one and the same Synod are the wiser and
the better.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="90" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>90.</HEAD>
<P>Furthermore, the line of Ecclesiasticall Subordination is
longer and further stretched, then the line of civill Subordina∣tion;
for a Nationall Synod must be subordinate and subject
to an Universall Synod, in the manner aforesaid, whereas yet
there is no Occumenicall Parliament, or generall civill Court
acknowledged, unto which the supream civill Senate, in this or
that Nation, should be subject. Finally, neither is the Church
altogether destitute of nearer remedies, whether an universall
counsell may be had or not.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="91" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>91.</HEAD>
<P>For the Nationall Synod ought to declare, and that with
greatest reverence, to the Magistrate, the grounds of their sen∣tence,
and the reasons of their proceedings, when he deman∣deth
or enquireth into the same, and desireth to be satisfied: but
if the Magistrate nevertheless do dissent, or cannot by con∣trary
reasons (which may be brought, if he please) move
the Synod to alter their judgment, yet may he require, and pro∣cure,
that the matter be again debated and canvassed in another
National Synod; and so the reasons on both sides being
throughly weighed, may be lawfully determined in an Eccle∣siastical
way.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="92" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>92.</HEAD>
<P>But as there is much indeed to be given to the demand of the
Magistrate; so is there here a two-fold caution to be used: For
first, notwithstanding of a future revision, it is necessary that
the former sentence of the Synod, whether concerning the
administration of Ecclesiastick Discipline, or against any Here∣sie,
be forthwith put in execution; least by lingering and ma∣king
of delays, the evil of the Church take deeper root, and
the gangreen spread and creep further: and least violence be
done to the Consciences of Ministers, if they be constrained to
impart the signs and seals of the Covenant of Grace to dogs and
swine, that is, to unclean persons, wallowing in the mire of
ungodliness; and least subtile men abuse such interims or inter∣vals,
so as that Ecclesiasticall Discipline altogether decay, and
the very decrees of Synods be accounted as cobwebs, which
none feareth to break down.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="93" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>93.</HEAD>
<P>Next it may be granted, that the matter may be put under
a further examination, yet upon condition, that when it is
come to the revision of the former sentence, regard may be
had of the weaker which are found willing to be taught,
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>
though they doubt, but that unto the wicked and contentious
tempters, which do mainly strive to oppress our liberty which
we have in Christ, and to bring us into bondage, we do not
for a moment give place by subjecting our selves: For what
else seek they or wait for, then that under the pretence of a re∣vising
and of new debate, they cast in lets and impediments e∣ver
and anon, and that by cunning lyings in wait, they may
betray the liberty of the Church, and in process of time may by
open violence, more forceably break in upon it, or at least,
constrain the Ministers of the Church to weave <HI>Penelop's</HI> web,
which they can never bring to an end.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="94" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>94.</HEAD>
<P>Moreover, the Christian Magistrate hath then only dis∣charged
his office in reference to Ecclesiasticall Discipline,
when not only he withdraweth nothing from it, and ma∣keth
no impedient to it, but also affordeth speciall furtherance
and help to it, according to the Prophecy, <HI>Esai. 49. 23. And
Kings shal be thy nursing fathers, and Queens thy nursing
mothers.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="95" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>95.</HEAD>
<P>For Christian Magistrates and Princes embracing Christ,
and sincerely giving their names to him, do not only serve him
as men, but also use their office to his glory, and the good of
the Church: they defend, stand for, and take care to propagate
the true Faith and Godliness, they affoord places of habitation
to the Church, and furnish necessary helps and supports, turn
away injuries done to it, restrain false Religion, and cherish,
underprop, and defend the Rights and Liberties of the Church:
so far they are from diminishing, changing or restrai∣ning
those Rights, for so the condition of the Church
were in that respect worse, and the Liberty thereof more
cut short, under the Christian Magistrate, then under the infi∣dell
or heathen.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="96" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>
<HEAD>96.</HEAD>
<P>Wherefore seeing these nursing fathers, favourers and de∣fenders,
can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth,
nor have any right against the Gospel, but for the Gospel; and
their power in respect of the Church, whereof they bear the
care, being not <HI>privative</HI> or <HI>destructive,</HI> but <HI>cumulative</HI>
and <HI>auxiliary,</HI> thereby it is sufficiently clear, that they ought
to cherish, and by their authority, ought to establish the
Ecclesiasticall Discipline; but yet not with implicite Faith,
or blind obedience: For the Reformed Churches do not
deny to any of the faithfull, much less to the Magistrate,
the judgment of Christian prudence and discretion, concer∣ning
those things which are decreed or determined by the
Church.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="97" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>97.</HEAD>
<P>Therefore, as to each Member of the Church respectively,
so unto the Magistrate belongeth the judgment of such things,
both to apprehend and to judg of them; for although the Magi∣strate
is not ordained and preferred of God, that he should be
a judg of matters and causes spirituall, of which there is con∣troversie
in the Church: Yet is he questionless judg of his own
civill act, about spirituall things; namely, of defending them
in his own Dominions, and of approving or tolerating the
same; and if in this business he judg and determine according
to the wisdom of the flesh, and not according to the wisdom
which is from above, he is to render an account thereof before
the supream Tribunall.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="98" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>98.</HEAD>
<P>However the Ecclesiasticall Discipline, according as it
is ordained by Christ, whether it be established and ratified
by civill authority, or not, ought to be retained and exercised
in the Society of the faithfull (as long as it is free and safe for
them to come together in holy Assemblies) for the want of
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>
civil authority is unto the Church like a <HI>ceasing gain,</HI> but not
like <HI>Damage</HI> or <HI>loss ensuing;</HI> as it superaddeth nothing more,
so it takes nothing away.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="99" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>99.</HEAD>
<P>If it further happen (which God forbid) that the Magistrate
do so far abuse his authority, that he doth straitly forbid what
Christ hath ordained; yet the constant and faithful servants of
Christ, will resolve and determine with themselves, that any
extremities are rather to be undergone, then that they should
obey such things, and that we ought to obey God rather then
men; yea they will not leave off to perform all the parts of
their office, being ready, in the mean time, to render a reason of
their practice to every one that demandeth it, but specially
unto the Magistrate, (as was said before.)</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="100" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>100.</HEAD>
<P>These things are not to that end and purpose proposed, that
these functions should be opposed one against another, in a ho∣stile
posture, or in terms of enmity, then which nothing is more
hurtful to the Church and Common-wealth, nothing more
execrable to them who are truly and sincerely zealous for the
house of God (for they have not so learned Christ:) but the
aim is, First and above all, that unto the King of Kings and Lord
of Lords, Jesus Christ the only Monarch of the Church, his own
prerogative Royal (of which also himself in the World was
accused, and for his witnessing a good confession thereof before
<HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> was unjustly condemned to death) may be fully
maintained and defended.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="101" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>101.</HEAD>
<P>Next, this debate also tendeth to this end, that the pow∣er
as well of Ecclesiasticall censure as of the civil sword be∣ing
in force, the licentiousness of carnal men, which desire
that there be too slack Ecclesiastical Discipline or none at all,
may be bridled, and so men may sin less, and may live more
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>
agreeably to the Gospel. Another thing here intended is, that
errours on both sides being overthrown, (as well the errour
of those who under a fair pretence of maintaining and defen∣ding
the rights of Magistracy, do leave to the Church either no
power, or that which is too weak; as the errour of others,
who under the vail of a certain suppositious and imaginary
Christian Liberty, do turn off the yoke of the Magistrate)
both powers may enjoy their own Priviledges; add hereto
that both powers being circumscribed with their distinct bor∣ders
and bounds, and also the one underpropped and strength∣ned
by the help of the other, a holy concord between them
may be nourished, and they may mutually and friendly imbrace
one another.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="102" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>102.</HEAD>
<P>Last of all, seeing there are not wanting some unhappy men,
who cease not to pervert the right ways of the Lord, and with
all diligence go about to shake off the yoke of the Ecclesiastical
Discipline, where now tis about to be introduced, yea also
where it hath been long ago established, and as yet happily re∣maineth
in force, it was necessary to obviate their most wicked
purposes; Which things being so, let all which hath been
said, passe with the good leave and liking of those orthodox
Churches in which the Discipline of Excommunication is not
as yet in use: neither can any offence easily arise to them from
hence; yea (if the best conjecture do not deceive) they cannot
but rejoyce and congratulate at the defence and vindication of
this Discipline.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="103" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>103.</HEAD>
<P>For those Churches do not deny but acknowledg and
teach, that the Discipline of Excommunication is most agree∣able
to the Word of God, as also that it ought to be restored
and exercised; Which also heretofore the most learned <HI>Za∣chary

<P><HI>For thus he,</HI> In other Churches, where either no Ex∣communication
is in use, or tis not lawfully administred,
and neverthelesse without all controversie, it is confessed
and openly taught, that it ought justly to be received and
be of force in the Church: <HI>and a little after,</HI> Lest also
your Hignesse by this new opinion do sever your self and
your Churches from all other Churches, as well those which
have not Excommunication, as those which have it: For∣asmuch

confessed, that there is reason why it ought to be
in use.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="105" TYPE="proposition">

<P><HI>To the same purpose it tendeth which the highly esteemed</HI>
Philip Melancthon <HI>in his Common places, chap. of civil Ma∣gistrates,
doth affirm:</HI> Before <HI>(saith he)</HI> I warned that civil
Places and Powers are to be distinguished from the adhering
confusions which arise from other causes, partly from the ma∣lice
of the devil, partly from the malice of men, partly from
the common infirmity of men, as it cometh to passe in other
kinds of life and Government ordained of God. No
man doubteth, that Ecclesiastical Government is ordained
of God, and yet how many and great disorders grow in it
from other causes. <HI>Where he mentioneth a Church Govern∣ment

take care that this wholesom medicine, thrown out of the

that is, that scandalous sins be punished: fon this is
the very end of Excommunication, that mens manners may
be well ordered, and the Saints flourish, the prophane being
restrained, lest wicked men by their impudency and impiety
increase and undo all. It is our part, ô brethren, with
greatest diligence to take care of these things; for we see

for the establishing of their own tyranny,
it cometh to pass, that almost no just Discipline can be any
more settled in the Church, but unlesse the wicked be re∣strained,
all things must of necessity run into the worst
condition, <HI>See besides, the opinion of</HI> Fabritius, <HI>upon</HI>
Psal. 149. 6, 7, 8, 9. <HI>of spirituall corrections, which he

<P>It can hardly be doubted or called in question, but besides
these, other learned and Godly Divines of those Churches were
and are of the same mind herein, with those now cited; and
indeed the very Confession of Faith of the Churches of <HI>Helve∣tia,
Chap.</HI> 18. may be an evidence hereof. <HI>But there ought
to be in the mean time a just Discipline amongst Ministers,
for the doctrine and life of Ministers is diligently to be enquired
of in Synods: Those that sin are to be rebuked of the Elders,
and to be brought again into the way, if they be curable; or to
be deposed, and like wolves driven away from the floek of the
Lord, if they be incurable.</HI> That this manner of Synodical
censure, namely of deposing Ministers from their office for
some great scandal, is used in the republike of <HI>Zurick, Lava∣ter</HI>
is witness, in his book of the Rites and Ordinances of the
Church of <HI>Zurick,</HI> Chap. 23. Surely they could not be of that

<P><HI>Yea the</HI> Helvetian <HI>Confession in the place now cited, doth
so tax the inordinate zeal of the Donatists and Anabaptists
(which are so bent upon the rooting out of the tares out of the

up the wheat) that withall it doth not obscurely commend the
Ecclesiastical</HI> Forensical <HI>Discipline, as distinct from the civil
Power,</HI> and seeing (<HI>say they</HI>) ttis altogether necessary that
there be in the Church a Discipline; and among the Anci∣ents
in times past Excommunication hath been usual, and Ec∣clesiastical
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>
Courts have been among the People of God, among
whom this Discipline was exercised by prudent and goods men;
It belongeth also to Ministers according to the case of the
times, the publick estate and necessity, to moderate this Dis∣cipline;
Where this rule is ever to be held, that all ought to
be done to edification, decently, honestly, without tyranny and se∣dition;
The Apostle also witnesseth, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. that to him∣self,

their eares against the importunate suits of whatsoever claw∣backs,
which would stir them up against the Church; and
that also all Governours and Rulers of Churches, being every

<P>Finally, all those who are more averse from Eccle∣siastick

and intreated through our Lord Jesus Christ, that
they be no longer entangled and enveagled with carnall
prejudice, to give place in this thing to humane affections,

and to measure by their own corrupt reason spirituall Disci∣pline,
but that they do seriously think with themselves, and

and be permitted to follow their own lusts without
