<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Rich. II.</HEAD>
<P>BY the <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg1">Mirror of Ju∣stices. <HI>f.</HI> 152.</NOTE> Common Law of <HI>England</HI> the punishment of Heresie was burning the Heretick, by vertue of the Writ <HI>de Haeretico comburendo</HI>; <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg1">Fitz. Natur. Brev. <HI>f.</HI> 269.</NOTE> which was first to issue. What was accounted Heresie before the time of <HI>Ed.</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> I shall not enquire. That the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> hath always ter∣med those <HI>Hereticks,</HI> who have opposed her Innovasions and Corrup∣tions, can't be denyed, and is sufficient to my purpose. The first of these that apppeared in <HI>England,</HI> was <HI>John Wickliffe,</HI> in the latter end of the Reign of <HI>King Ed.</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> in the year 1371. And therefore there was no occasion for putting the Law in Execution till his time; but upon his ap∣pearance, he Preaching and Teaching several Doctrines that tended to a Re∣formation; the <HI>Romish</HI> Clergy (<HI>fond of their Diana</HI>) presently endeavours to si∣lence him, which they had done, had not the favour of some great men at that time stopt their proceedings against him; so that, (notwithstanding their Rage and Malice against him) he at last dyed in his Bed: But such an Implacable Hatred they bore to his Memory, because he had begun to dispel those Clouds of Darkness and Ignorance, with which this Church of <HI>England</HI> was then over∣spread, that they <NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg1">Ex actis Con∣silii <HI>Constan.</HI></NOTE> Procured a Decree of the Synod of <HI>Constance,</HI> for the taking up his Body and Bones to be burnt▪ one and forty years after he was buried, for being an obstinate Heretick: In obedience to which Decree, the <HI>Popish Clergy</HI> in the time of <HI>King Richard</HI> the 2<HI>d,</HI> took up his Bones out of his Grave, and burnt them, and cast the Ashes into a River. Such Enemies were they then to <HI>Christ's</HI> Religion, that they would not suffer the Ashes of this great <HI>Luminary</HI> to rest, lest (as they were superstitious enough to think) they should again revive, to make a further discovery of their Works of Darkness.</P>
<P>In this <NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg1"><HI>Trussel</HI>'s Con∣tinuation of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Histo∣ry of <HI>England.</HI> fol. <HI>49.</HI></NOTE> King's Reign execution by Fire was first put in practice within this Realm, for opposing the Superstition and Idolatry of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Before this time there being no Statute to punish the Oppugners of the <HI>Romish</HI> Innovasions, and Corruptions in matters of Doctrine and Worship. The Clergy of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, made use of the weakness of <HI>R.</HI> 2. and prevailed with him to consent to the owning a supposititious Law, of their own contriving and drawing up, with∣out the consent of <HI>the Commons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. Inst. 3. <HI>p. fol.</HI> 40, 41.</NOTE> <HI>That Commissions should be by the Lord Chan∣cellor made, and directed to Sheriffs and others, to arrest such as should be cer∣tified into the</HI> Chancery <HI>by the Bishops and Prelates, to be Preachers of Heresie and notorious Errors, their Fautors, Maintainers, and Abettors, and to hold them in strong Prison, until they would justifie themselves to the Law of Holy Church.</HI> Which Act of Parliament was the first that was made against them that preached against the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> under the Notion of their being Hereticks▪
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
who were then called <HI>Wicklivites.</HI> The Act it self I have here inserted, as it is Printed in <HI>Rastal</HI>'s Statutes.</P>
<P><NOTE N="5" PLACE="marg1"><P>R. <HI>2.</HI> Ca. <HI>5. Rast. Stat.</HI> f. <HI>140.</HI></P><P>The <HI>Wickli∣vites</HI> to be im∣prisoned.</P></NOTE><HI>Forasmuch as it is openly known, that there be divers evil persons within the Realm, going from County, to County, and from Town, to Town, in certain habits, under dissimulation of great Holyness, and without the Lycens;e of the Ordina∣cies of the places, or other sufficient Authority, Preaching daily, not only in Churches, and Church-yards; but also in Markets, Fairs, and other open places, where a great Congregation of people is, divers Sermons containing Heresies, and notorious Er∣rors, to the great embleamishing of the Christian Faith, and destruction of the Laws, and of the estate of Holy Church, to the great peril of the souls of the people, and of all the Realm of</HI> England, <HI>as more plainly is found, and sufficiently proved, before the Re∣verend Father in God the Arch-Bishop of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>and the Bishops and other Pre∣lates, Masters of Divinity, and Doctors of canon and of civil Law, and a great part of the Clergy of the said Realm, especially assembled for this cause: which persons do also preach divers matters of slander, to engender discord and dissention, betwixt divers Estates of the said Realm, as well Spiritual as Temporal, in exciting of the people to the great peril of all the Realm: which Preachers cited or summoned before the Ordinaries of the places, there to answer of that whereof they be Impeached, will not obey to their Summons and Commandments; nor care not for their Monitions nor Censures of the Holy Church, but expresly despise them: and moreover, by their subtil and ingenious words, do draw the people to hear their Sermons, and do main∣tain them in their Errors, by strong hand and by great Routs: It is ordained and assented in this present Parliament, that the King's Commissions be made, and di∣rected to the Sheriffs, and other Ministers of our Soveraign Lord the King, or other sufficient persons Learned, and according to the Certifications of the Prelates thereof, to be made in the Chancery from time to time, to arrest all such Preachers, and also their Fautors, Maintainers and Abettors, and to hold them in Arrest and strong Prison, till they will justifie them according to the Law and Reason of Holy Church, and the King will and commandeth, That the Chancellor make such Commissions at all times, that he by the Prelates or any of them, shall be certified and thereof required as is aforesaid.</HI></P>
<P>By this Act it appears, that there were then several persons, who would not submit themselves to the <HI>Romish Bishops</HI> and <HI>Prelates,</HI> and the Histories of those times acquaint us, that they were the Professors of the true Religion, afterwards called <HI>Protestants.</HI> By Colour of this supposed Act, certain persons that held that <HI>I∣mages</HI> were not to be worshipped,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. Inst. 3<HI>d. fol.</HI> 40.</NOTE> and such like Doctrines (which the <HI>Protestants</HI> now hold) were detained, and tormented in Prison, till they were compelled be∣fore the <HI>Masters of Divinity</HI> (as they called themselves) to take an Oath, and did swear to worship Images, which was against the Moral and Eternal Law of Al∣mighty God. This, these <HI>Popish Bishops</HI> and <HI>Prelates</HI> did, by vertue of this Law; which indeed was none, for it was onely signed by the King at the instance of the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Prelates,</HI> and never assented to by the Commons; and therefore in the next Parliament, the Commons preferred a <HI>Bill,</HI> reciting the said supposed Act, and constantly affirmed, that they never assented thereunto, and therefore desired, that the same might be made void, for they <HI>protested</HI> that it was never their in∣tent to be justified, and to bind themselves and their Successors to the <HI>Prelates</HI> more than their Ancestors had done in times past, whereto the King gave his Roy∣al Assent, in these words, <HI>y pleist au Roy.</HI> But in the Proclamation of the Acts of that Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. 12.58. <HI>and</HI> 3.

<P><HI>THe Rage of the Popish Clergy <HI>against the</HI> Wicklivites, <HI>or Professors of the true Religion, increasing with the increase of the light of the</HI> Gospel, <HI>and they fearing that the said contrivance might be detected, to the end that they might be yet more able effectually (if it were possible) to suppress the truth; when they

had requited</HI> R. <HI>2. for granting them that supposed Law, with deposing him, and assisting</HI> H. <HI>4. to usurp the Crown; they in the 2</HI> d.

<P>Whereas it is shewed to our Soveraign Lord the King, on the behalf of the Prelates and Clergy of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> in this present Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>2</HI> H. <HI>4.</HI> ca. <HI>15. Rast. Stat.</HI> f. <HI>180.</HI></P><P>By this Law the Professors of the true Religion: were to be burnt as Hereticks.</P></NOTE> that although the Catholick Faith builded upon Christ, and by his Apostles, and the holy Church, sufficiently determined, declared, and approved, hath been hitherto, by good, and holy, and most noble Progenitors of our Soveraign Lord the King, in the said Realm, amongst all the Realms of the World, most devoutly observed; and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by his said most noble Progenitors, and Ancestors, to the honour of God, and of the whole Realm aforesaid, laudably endowed, and in her Rights and Liberties sustained, without that, that the same Faith, or the said Church was hurt, or grievously oppres∣sed, or else perturbed by any perverse Doctrine, or Wicked, Heretical, or Erronious Opinions: Yet nevertheless, divers false and perverse people, of a certain new Sect, of the Faith of the Sacraments of the Church, and the Authority of the same, dam∣nably thinking, and against the Law of God and of the Church, usurping the Office of Preaching, do perversly and malitiously, in divers places within the said Realm, under the colour of dissembled Holiness, preach and teach these dayes openly and privily, di∣vers new Doctrines, and wicked, heretical and eronious Opinions, contrary to the same Faith, and blessed determinations of the Holy Church. And of such Sect, and wicked Doctrine and Opinions, they make unlawful Conventicles and Confederacies, they hold and exercise Schools, they make and write Books, they do wickedly instruct and informe people, and as much as they may, excite and stir them to Sedition and Insurrection, and maketh great strife and division among the people, and other Enor∣mities horribly to be heard, daily do perpetrate and commit, in subversion of the said Catholick Faith, and Doctrine of the Holy Church, in diminution of God's Honour, and also in destruction of the Estates, Rights, and Liberties of the said Church of <HI>England,</HI> by which Sect, and wicked and false Preachings, Doctrines, and Opinions of the said false and perverse people; not only most greatest peril of the Souls, but also many other harts, flanders, and perils, (which God prohibit) might come to this Realm, unless it be the more plentifully and speedily holpen, by the King's Majesty in this behalf, namely, whereas the Diocesans of the said Realm, cannot by their Iurisdiction Spiritual, without aid of the said Royal Majesty, sufficiently correct the said false and perverse people, nor refrain their malice, because the said false and perverse people, do go from Diocess to Diocess, and will not appear before the said Diocesans, but the same Diocesans, and their Iurisdiction Spiritual, and the Keys of the Church, with the Censures of the same, do utterly contemn and despise, and so their wicked Preach∣ings, and Doctrines, doth from day to day, continue and exercise, to the hatred of Right and Reason, and utter destruction of Order and good Rule. Vpon which No∣velties and Excesses above rehersed, the Prelates and Clergy aforesaid, and also the Commons of the said Realm, being in the said Parliament, praying our Soveraign Lord the King, that his Royal Highness would vouchsafe in the said Parliament, to provide a convenient Remedy: The same our Soveraign Lord the King, gratiously considering the premises, and also the laudable steps of his said most noble Progeni∣tors, and Ancestors, for the conservation of the said Catholick Faith, and sustentation of God's Honour, and also the safeguard of the Estates, Rights, and Liberties of the said Church of <HI>England,</HI> to the laud of God, and merit of our said Soveraign Lord the King, and prosperity and honour of all the said Realm, and for the eschew∣ing of such Dissentions, divisions, hurts, slanders and perils in time to come; and that this wicked Sect, preachings, doctrines and Opinions, should from henceforth cease and be utterly destroyed, by the assent of the States and other discreet men of the Realm, being in the said Parliament; hath Granted, Established, and Ordained from henceforth, and firmly to be observed, That none within the said Realm, or any other Dominions subject to his Royal Majesty, presume to preach openly or privily, without the Lycense, of the Diocesan of the same place, first required, and obtained, Curates in their own Churches, and persons hitherto priviledged, and other of▪ the Cannon Law granted, only except. Nor that none from henceforth any thing preach, hold, teach or instruct, openly or privily, or make, or write any Book, contrary to the Catholick Faith, or determination of the Holy Church, nor of such Sect and wicked Doctrines, and O∣pinions, shall make any Conventicles, or in any wise hold or exercise Schools, and also that none from henceforth, in any wise, favour such preacher, or maker of any such, and like Conventicles, or holding or exercising of Schools, or making or writing such Books, or so teaching, informing, or exciting the people, nor any of them maintain, or any wise sustain, and that all and singular having such Books or any
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Writings of such wicked doctrines and opinions, shall really with effect, deliver or cause to be deliverd, all such Books and Writings, to the Dyocesan of the same place, within forty days from the time of the Proclamation of this Or∣dinance and Statute: And if any person or persons, of whatsoever kind, estate, or condition, that he or they be, from henceforth, do attempt against the Royal Ordinance and Statute aforesaid, in the premises, or in any of them, or such books, in the forme aforesaid, do not deliver; then the Diocesan of the same place, in his Dyocess, such person or persons in this behalf defamed, or evidently suspected, and every of them, may by the Authority of the said Ordinance and Statute, cause to be arrested, and under safe custody in his prisons to be detained, till he or they, of the Arti∣cles laid to him or them, in this behalf, do canonically purge him or themselves, or else such wicked Sect, Doctrines, Preachings, and Heretical, and Erroneous Opinions, do abjure, according as the Laws of the Church do require; so that the said Diocesan by himself, or his Commissaries, do openly and judiciously proceed against such persons, so arrested, and remaining under his safe Custody to all effect of the Law, and deter∣mine that same business, according to the Canonical Decrees, within three months af∣ter the said arrest, any lawful impediment, ceasing. And if any person, in any case above expressed, be before the Diocesan of the place, or his Commissaries, Canonically convict, then the same Diocesan may do to be kept in his prison, the said person, so con∣vict for the manner of his default, and after the quality of the offence, according and as long as to his discretion shall seem expedient, and moreover to put the same person to the secular Court (except in cases, where he according to the Canonical Decree ought to be left,) to pay to our Soveraign Lord the King his pecuniar fine, accor∣ding as the same fine shall seem competent to the Diocesan, for the manner and quality of the offence, in which case the same Diocesan shall be bound to certifie the King of the same Fine in his Exchequer by his Letters Patents, sealed with his seal, to the effect, that such Fine by the King's Authority may be required, and levyed to his use, of the goods of the same person so convict. And if any person within the said Realm and Dominion, upon the said wicked preachings, doctrines, opinions, schools and he∣retical and erroneous informations, or any of them, be before the Diocesan of the same place, or his Commissaries, sententially convict, and the same wicked Sect, preachings, doctrines and opinions, schools, and informations, do refuse duely to abjure: Or by the Diocesan of the same place, or his Commissaries, after the abjuration made by the same person pronounced, fall into relaps, so that according to the holy Canons, he ought to be left to the secular Court, whereupon credence shall be given to the Diocesan of the same place, or to his Commissaries in this behalf, then the Sheriff of the County of the same place, and Mayor and Sheriffs, or Sheriff, or Mayor and Bayliffs, of the City, Town, and Burrough of the same County, next to the same Diocesan, or the said Commissaries, shall be personally present in preferring of such sentences, when they by the same Diocesan, or his Commissaries, shall be required, and they the same persons, and every of them, after such sentence promulgate, shall receive, and them before the people, in a high place do to be burnt, that such punishment may strike in fear to the minds of other, whereby no such wicked Doctrine, and Heretical and Erroni∣ous Opinions, nor their Authors, and Fautors in the said Realm and Dominions against the Catholick Faith, Christian Law and Determination of the holy Church, which God prohibit, be sustained, or in any wise suffered, in which all and singular the premises, concerning the said Ordinance and Statute, the Sheriffs, Mayors, and Bayliffs, of the said Counties, Cities, Burroughs and Towns, shall be attending, aiding and supporting, to the said Diocesans and their Commissaries.</P>
<P><HI>From the Preamble of which Act of Parliament, and the Act it self, I observe three things. 1</HI><HI>st. <HI>That it being soon after the death of</HI> Wickliffe, <HI>the persons there mentioned to have had a new Faith, about the Sacraments of the Church, and the Authority of the same; and that Preached without authority, that gathered Conventicles, taught Schools, and wrote Books against the Catholick Faith, with many other hainous aggravations, had been the followers of</HI> Wickliff, <HI>and were then of</HI> John Huss, <HI>and</HI> Jerom <HI>of</HI> Prague, <HI>and the rest of the</HI> Reformers <HI>from Po∣pery, and were carrying on that Blessed Work, as fast as they could. 2</HI>ly. <HI>That the end and Design of this Law, was, That that</HI> Sect <HI>(as the Act calls them) their Preachings, Doctrines, and Opinions, should from thenceforth Cease, and be utter∣ly destroyed. And 3</HI>dly. <HI>That in order thereunto by this Statute: The Sheriffs or other Officers, were immediately to proceed, to the burning of</HI> Hereticks <HI>(i. e.)</HI> Protestants, <HI>without any Writ or Warrant from the King; without which Writ (as I observed before,) they could not proceed to burn any Person; and accordingly they proceed in burning the Professors of the true Religion, all the Reign of</HI> King H. the <HI>4</HI>th.</HI></P>

And if any be Indicted of Heresie, Error, or <HI>Lollardry,</HI> and taken by the Sheriff or other Officer, he shall be let to main prize within the said ten days by good Surety, to whom the said Sheriffs, or other Officers will answer, so that the said person or persons, which were so indicted, be ready to be delivered to the said Ordinaries or to their Commissaries, before the end of the said ten days, if he may by any means for sickness, and every Ordi∣nary shall have sufficient Commissaries or Commissary, dwelling in every County, in a place notable; so that if any such person so indicted be taken, that the said Commissaries or Commissary, may be warned in the notable place where he dwelleth, by the Sheriff or his Officers, to come to the King's Iayl in the same County, there to receive the same persons so indicted by Indentures as before: And that in the inquest in this case to be taken, the Sheriffs and other Officers to whom it belongeth, shall do to be Impannel'd good and sufficient persons not suspected nor procured, that is to say, that every of them which shall be so Empanell'd in such Inquest, have within the Realm of <HI>England</HI> an hundred Shillings of Lands, Tenements, or of Rent by the year, upon pain to lose to the King's use <HI>10 l.</HI> and they which shall be Impannell'd in such Inquests in <HI>Wales,</HI> every of them shall have to the value of <HI>40 s.</HI> by year, and if any such person be arrested, be it by the Ordinary or by the King's Officers or Ministers, and escape or break the pri∣son, before that he be acquit before the Ordinary, the Goods and Chattels which he had the day of such arrest, shall be forfeit to the King, and his Lands and Tenements which he had the same day seized also in the King's hands, the King shall have the profits thereof from the same day until he be yeilden to the prison from which he escaped, and that the aforesaid Iustices have full power to enquire of all such Escapes, breaking of Prison, and also of Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels of such persons so indicted, pro∣vided also that if any such person indicted, do not return to the said prison, and dieth not convict, it shall be lawful to his Heirs to enter into the Lands and Tenements of their Ancestor, without any other pursuit making to the King for this cause, and that all they which have Liberties and Franchises Royal in <HI>England,</HI> as in the County of <HI>Chester,</HI> the County and Liberty of <HI>Durham,</HI> and other like, and also the Lords which have Iurisdi∣ction and Franchises Royal in <HI>Wales,</HI> where the King's Writs do not run, have power to execute and put in due execution these Articles in all points, by them or by their Officers, in like manner as the Iustices and other the King's Officers before declared should do.</P>
<P><HI>By which Act it plainly appears, that the Professors of the true Religion, were not only to suffer in their own persons by being most inhumanly burnt, but their very Wives <HI>and</HI> Children <HI>must feel the effects of</HI> Popish <HI>Cruelty, having nothing left by this Law, whereby to support their Families</HI>.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Hen. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE three Laws in the precedent Chapters mentioned, were put in severe Exe∣cution, during the Reigns of <HI>R.</HI> 2. <HI>H.</HI> 4. <HI>H.</HI> 5. <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>E.</HI> 4. <HI>R.</HI> 3. <HI>H.</HI> 7. and to the twenty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th.</HI> during which time the <HI>Whore</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> made her self drunk with the Blood of the <HI>Saints</HI>; not only halling them to prison, but burning their Persons, and ruining their whole Families. In which time divers were
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HI>Martyred</HI> purely to please and gratifie the <HI>Popish Clergy,</HI> for whatever they said was <HI>Heresie.</HI> must be so, upon which Account they run the Persecution so high, that in 25 <HI>H.</HI> 8. (about which time the Professors of the true Religion were first called Pro∣testants) the Parliament began to consider, That <HI>Heresie</HI> was no where defined, and made an Act of Parliament, for the Punishment of <HI>Heresie,</HI> but by it repealed the Statute of 2 <HI>H.</HI> 4. <HI>ca.</HI> 15. the preamble of which Act doth declare.</P>
<P><HI>That the Clergy did upon their suggestions, obtain the said Act,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>25</HI> H. <HI>8.</HI> ca. <HI>14. Rast. Stat.</HI> fo. <HI>537.</HI></P><P>By this Law Pro∣testants were to abjere or be burnt.</P></NOTE> <HI>but that the same did not in any part thereof declare what was Heresie, and that the word Canonical Sancti∣ons, are so general that it was difficult to avoid the Penalties of the Act, in case he should be examined upon captious interrogatories, as the Ordinaries did then use to per∣sons suspect of Heresies, and that all such proceedings were against the antient Laws of the Kingdom, and for those reasons did repeal the said Act of</HI> 2 H. 4. ca. 15. <HI>and for redress of Heresie did establish</HI> 5 R. 2.5. <HI>and</HI> 2 H. 5.7. <HI>and did enact, that Sheriffs in their Turns, and Stewards in their Leets, Rapes, and Wapentakes, should have Authority to en∣quire of Hereticks, and every such Presentment made in any Turn, Leet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Co.

<P>By this Act indeed some part of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> as to the Tryal of the Parties guilty, seems to be restored, but they could not yet think of parting with the seve∣rity of the Penalties, I mean burning their Persons, and confiscating their Estates; and that the World might at length know, who were deemed <HI>Hereticks,</HI> and who not, (for before it was no where defined what Heresie was) in the 31<HI>st</HI> of <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>ca.</HI> 14.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>31 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>ca.</HI> 14. Rast. Stat. <HI>fol.</HI> 652.</P><P>By this Law Pro∣testants are made Traytors, Felons, and guil∣ty of a premu∣nire.</P></NOTE> An Act of Parliament was made, called an Act for abolishing of Opinions in certain Ar∣ticles concerning Christian Religion, six Articles were agreed on, and consen∣ted to, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That in the most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, by the strength and efficacy of Christ's mighty word (it being spoken by the Priest) is present really under the form of Bread and Wine, the natural Body and Blood of our Saviour Jesu Christ, Conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the Consecration, there remaineth no substance of Bread or Wine, nor any other substance, but the substance of Christ God and Man.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Communion in both kinds, is not necessary</HI> ad salutem <HI>by the Law of God, to all persons, and that it is to be believed, and not doubted of, but that in the Flesh under the form of Bread, is the very Blood, and with the Blood, under the form of Wine, is the very Flesh, as well a part, as though they were both together.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That Priests, after the Order of Priesthood received, may not marry by the Law of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That Vows of Chastity, Widdowhood, by Man or Woman, made to God advisedly, ought to be deserved, by the Law of God, and that it exempts them from other Liberties of Christian People, which without that they might enjoy.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That it is meet, and necessary, that private Masses be continued, and admitted in the King's</HI> English <HI>Church, and Congregations, as whereby good Christian People, ordering themselves accordingly, do receive both Godly and goodly consolations and benefits, and it is a∣greeable also to God's Law.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That Auricular Confession is expedient, and necessary to be retained and continued, used and frequented, in the Church of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He that by word of Mouth, Writing, Printing, Cyphering, or in any otherwise, doth Pub∣lish, Preach, Teach, Say, Affirm, Declare, Dispute, Argue, or hold any Opinion contrary to the first Article, is by that Act of</HI> 31 H. 8. ca. 14. <HI>Declared a Heretick, to suffer Death by burning, and to forfeit his Estate as in case of High Treason: The publick Preaching, and affirming in a Court of Justice, any thing contrary to the other five Articles, and Mar∣rying after a vow of Chastity, is declared Felony, without Benefit of Clergy, and to forfeit as in cases of Felony. And if any Person by Words, Writing, Printing, Cyphering, or otherwise, publish, declare, or hold Opinion, contrary to the said five Articles, he forfeits his Goods and Chattels for ever, the Profits of his Lands, Tenements, and other his real Estate, during his life, his Spiritual Promotion shall be utterly void, and his body imprisoned, at the King's Pleasure, for the first offence, and for the second offence to be adjudg'd a Felon,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
and suffer and forfeit as a Felon, without Benefit of Clergy.</HI> By which Act it plainly ap∣pears, that the denying of Transubstantiation, was by this Law made High Treason.</P>
<P>The publishing or holding the necessity of Receiving in both kinds, the lawful∣ness of Priests Marrying, the unlawfulness of vowing Chastity, of private Masses, and Auricular Confession, was no less than <HI>Felony,</HI> or at least a <HI>Premunire</HI>; So that in a word, to be a <HI>Protestant,</HI> was to be a <HI>Traytor,</HI> a <HI>Felon,</HI> or subject to a <HI>Premunire</HI>: And could they have found any punishment inflicted by our Laws, that is worse, they would (no doubt) have made the <HI>Protestants</HI> subject to it, and that, not as Offenders against the Polity of the Civil State, but purely upon the Account of their <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, the next thing that is done by these destroyers of Souls as well as Bodies, is to take away all means of Knowledge (as well as to inhibit the Promulga∣tion thereof,) upon such severe Penalties; and for that purpose was the Act of 34 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>ca.</HI> 1. made: Whereby,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>34</HI> H. <HI>8.</HI> ca. <HI>1. Rast. Stat.</HI> p. <HI>782.</HI> The means of Knowledge in Religion, taken away by this Act from the Pro∣testants.</NOTE><HI>All Books of the Old and New Testament in</HI> English, <HI>being of</HI> Tindal's <HI>Translation, or Comprising any matter of Christian Religion, Articles of the Faith or holy Scrip∣ture, contrary to the Doctrine aforesaid,</HI> (i. e. <HI>the Doctrine of Popery) and set forth after the year</HI> 1540, <HI>or then to be set forth by the King were utterly abolished; no Printer or Bookseller was to utter any of the aforesaid Books, no person was to play in enter∣lude; sing or rhyme, contrary to the said Doctrine; no person was to retain any</HI> English <HI>Books, or Writings, concerning matter against the Holy and Blessed Sacra∣ment of the Altar,</HI> (i. e. <HI>the Mass) or other Books, abolished by the King's Proclamation, there was to be no annotations, or preambles in Bibles, or New Testaments in</HI> Eng∣lish: <HI>The Bible was not to be read in</HI> English <HI>in any Church, no Women, or Artificers, Prentices, Iourneymen, Servingmen, of the degrees of Yeomen, or under Husband∣men, nor Labourers, should read the new Testament in</HI> English: <HI>Nothing was to be taught or maintained, contrary to the King's Instructions, (which were for the suppressing Heresie or Protestantism) and if any Spiritual person should preach, teach, or maintain any thing contrary to the King's Instructions, or Determinations made, or to be made, and should be thereof Convict, he should for his first Offence recant, for the second ab∣jure, and bear a Fagot, and for his third should be adjudged an Heretick, and be burnt, and lose all his Goods and Chattels.</HI></P>
<P>And whoever will take the pains to read over <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg1"><HI>Dr.</HI> Burnet.</NOTE> the History of the Reformation, together with <NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg1">Fox.</NOTE> the Book of Martyrs, (of which Book Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his Preface to the first part of his History of the Reformation, saith, that he having compared his Acts and Monuments with the Records, had never been able to discover any Er∣rors or Prevarications in them, but the utmost fidelity and exactness,) will find so many instances of putting all these bloody Laws before mentioned in Execution, as I perswade my self, that there are some <HI>Papists</HI> would e'en blush at, and be throughly ashamed of; and if they have any thing of Humanity in them, must utterly abhor. But before I can carry on the account of the rest of the <HI>Penal Laws</HI> made by the <HI>Papists</HI> against the <HI>Protestants,</HI> (the Reformation in King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI>'s time, of Glorious Memory, intervening) I shall shew how the <HI>Reformers</HI> used the <HI>Papists</HI> in his Reign.</P>

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Ed. VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be expected that I should say something of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI>'s Reformation: But as to what was done in <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th</HI>'s time, I shall not trouble the Reader with any thing, because the Reverend and Learned Doctor <HI>Burnet</HI> is so far from giving him the Character of good; that he concludes his first part of the History of the Re∣formation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the Re∣formation, vol. <HI>1.</HI> p. <HI>362.</HI></NOTE> with this, (speaking of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<HI>th.</HI>) I do not deny that he is to be num∣bred among the ill Princes, yet I can't rank him with the worst. Which Character cer∣tainly the preceeding account of the Laws made in his time against the Protestants, does evidence to be very favourable to him.</P>
<P>I shall therefore begin with the Laws made in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6<HI>th.</HI> and the manner of introducing them. King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> coming to the Crown young, and <HI>Cranmer</HI> and others designing throughly to reform the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
from the Errors and Corruptions that were crept into Her, during the time she was under the <HI>Popish Tyranny</HI>: The first step that was set in order to it, was the visiting the <HI>Clergy</HI> quite over <HI>England,</HI> and compiling some wholesome <HI>Homilies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mild Methods us'd by King <HI>Ed.</HI> the <HI>6</HI>th. before any Laws made.</NOTE> to supply the defect of Sermons, by reason of the ignorance of the then <HI>Clergy,</HI> and to prevent unnecessary Disputes in the Pulpits: Their Articles and Injunctions for the Visitation, were to be observed, under the pains of <HI>Excommunication, Sequestration,</HI> or <HI>De∣privation,</HI> not upon the Penalty of being <HI>burnt</HI> as a <HI>Heretick,</HI> or forfeiture either of Lands in fee simple, or Goods or Chattels, or either, or any of them: This was done before the Parliament was called.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the 4<HI>th,</HI> 1547. The <HI>Parliament</HI> met, and the first <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> that was made, was an <HI>Act</HI> against such as should unreverently speak against the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Altar,</HI> and of the receiving thereof under both kinds, which <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> in the Preamble, takes notice:</P>
<P><HI>That the King, minding the Governance and Order of his most loving Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>1</HI> Ed. <HI>6.</HI> ca. <HI>1. Rast. Stat.</HI> f. <HI>902.</HI></P><P>The Administra∣tion of the Lords Supper restored and the punish∣ment inflicted on despisers and neglecters of it, more moderate than what the Papists inflicted on the Prote∣stants.</P></NOTE> to be in most perfect unity and concord in all things, and in especial in the true Faith and Religion of God, and wishing the same to be brought about with all Clemency and Mercy on his Highness part towards them, as his most Princely Serenity and Majesty, hath already declared by evident proof, to the intent that his most loving Subjects pro∣voked by Clemency and Goodness of their Prince and King, should study rather for love than fear, to do their duties, first to Almighty God, and then to him and the Com∣monwealth, nourishing concord and love amongst themselves; yet considered and per∣ceived, that in a Multitude, all were not of that sort, that Reason and the Knowledge of their Duty could move them from Offences, but many had need of some bridle of fear, and that same were men most contentious and arrogant, for the most part, or else most dlind and ignorant: by the means of which sort of men, many things well and godly instituted, and to the Edification of many were perverted and abused, and turned to their own and others great loss, and hindrance, and sometime to extream destruction, the which doth appear in nothing more, or sooner, than in matters of Religion, and in the great and high Mysteries thereof, and particularly, instanceth in the most comfortable Sacra∣ment of the body and blood of our Saviour Iesus Christ</HI>; and sets forth, <HI>that the same was Instituted by Christ himself, the words of the Institution, and for what end,</HI> and then saith, <HI>that notwithstanding this, the said Sacrament had been marvelously abused, by such manner of men before rehearsed, who of wickedness, or else of ignorance, and want of learning, for certain abuses then-to-fore committed, of some, in misusing there∣of, had condemned in their hearts and speech the whole thing, and contemptuously de∣praved, despised, or reviled the same most holy and blessed Sacrament, and not only dis∣puted and reasoned unreverently and ungodly of that most high Mystery, but also in their Sermons, Preachings, Readings, Lectures, Communications, Arguments, Talks, Songs, Plays, or Iests, name or call it by such vile and unseemly words, as Christian Ears do abhor to hear rehearsed.</HI></P>
<P>From this preamble, I gather, that the Popish Clergy had been greatly guilty of de∣faming the administration of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as used by the Pro∣testants, according to our Saviour's Institution, and that this Law was made to inhibit such defamations, and to effect the same with as much Clemency and Gentleness, as the nature of the thing and the circumstances of time would bear, as will appear by what was Enacted for Reformation of such abuse, which was, <HI>That whoever was guilty of the like abuse, after the time in the Act for that purpose mentioned, should be imprisoned, and make fine and ransome at the King's Will and Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That three Justices of the Peace at least, whereof one to be of the</HI> Quorum, <HI>should have power to take Informations and Accusations by the Oaths and Depositions of two able, honest, and lawful Persons, at the least, and then to trye the party accused, by a Jury at their Quarter Sessions.</HI></P>
<P>From which I observe, First, that the <HI>Reformers</HI> did not make any Offence, relating to the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> high Treason, as the Papists had done denying <HI>Transubstantiation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That they did not leave it to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> to examine in a <HI>Summary way,</HI> and convict, and then deliver the Offender over to the <HI>Secular</HI> power to be burnt; but left the Party to be accused by <HI>Legal Witnesses,</HI> and Tryed by a Jury of Honest and Legal Men, according to the <HI>Fundamental</HI> Laws of the Kingdom: Nay,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> They were so far from restraining the party accused of his <HI>Liberty,</HI> That it is particularly provided by the said Statute, that they might take Bail for his ap∣pearance. After which it was Enacted, by the same <HI>Act</HI> (and which I desire you to take in Doctor <HI>Burnet</HI>'s own words) <Q>That it being more agreeable to Christ's first Institution, and the practice of the Church for five hundred years after Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist Reform. pt. <HI>2.</HI> p. <HI>41.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
that the Sacrament should be given in both the kinds of Bread and Wine, than in one kind only, it should be commonly given in both kinds, except necessity did otherwise require; and it being also more agreeable to the first Institution and the Primitive Practice; that the People should receive with the Priest, than that the Priest should receive it alone: Therefore the day before every Sacrament, an Ex∣hortation was to be made to the People, to prepare themselves for it, in which the benefits and dangers of worthy and unworthy Receiving, were to be ex∣pressed, and the Priests were not without a lawful Cause, to deny it to any who humbly asked it.</Q></P>
<P>From which I observe, That this <HI>Act</HI> was made to restore the Administration of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> to its Antient and Primitive usage, in both kinds with the <HI>Priest,</HI> and that the <HI>Priest</HI> had not power to refuse giving it to any, without just ground; and that however here is no <HI>Penalty</HI> annexed either Spiritual or Temporal.</P>

And for the third offence should suffer Imprisonment during his life. And that Lay persons offending in the premi∣ses, should for the first offence, suffer Imprisonment during six Months without Bail or Mainprize, and for his second offence suffer Imprsonment during his Life. And it is further thereby Enacted, that if any person should in any Interludes, Plays, Songs, Rhymes, or by other open words, declare or speak any thing, in the derogation, depraving, or despising of the same Book, or of any thing therein contained, or any part thereof, or should by open Fact, Deed, or by open thréatnings compel, or cause, or otherwise pro∣cure, or Maintain any Parson, Vicar, or other Minister, in any Cathedral, or Parish Church, or Chappel, or in any other place, to sing or to say any common or open Prayer, or to Minister any Sacrament, otherwise, or in any other manner, or form, than is mentio∣ned in the said Book, or that by any of the said means, shall lawfully interrupt, or let any Parson, Vicar or other Minister, in any Cathedral, or Parish Church, Chappel, or any other place, to sing and say common and open prayer, or to minister the Sacraments, or any of them, in such manner and form, as is mentioned in the said Book, they should forfeit to the King our Soveraign Lord, his Heirs and Successors, ten pounds for the first offence, and for non-payment, should suffer three months Imprisonment, without Bail or Mainprize, and for the second offence twenty pounds, and for want of payment, should suffer six months Imprisonment, without Bail or Mainprise, and for the third offence should forfeit all his Goods and Chattels, and suffer Imprisonment during his life time.</HI></P>
<P>From which Act it is evident, that all the mild Methods were taken, that could be thought on, to win over the <HI>Papists</HI> to the Reformed Re∣ligion, for the Penalties incurred, were not only suspended, but the offender pardoned, after they had been so long winkt at, and the Penalties upon which Conformity was injoyned, must be by all considering men adjudged reasonable, to be inflicted upon those that remained obstinate, after such kind usage, and the ra∣ther, for that it is apparent, they made it their business to compel persons to go to <HI>Mass.</HI> One thing I can't let pass without a remark, That in this, as well as the Sta∣tute

<P>Upon the Death of King <HI>Edward,</HI> the Crown devolved upon Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> accor∣ding to the settlement of it, by 35 <HI>H.</HI> 8. but she being a <HI>Papist,</HI> and King <HI>Ed.</HI> the 6<HI>th,</HI> having by his Letters Patents, limited the <HI>Crown</HI> to the Lady <HI>Jane</HI> (Daughter of <HI>Frances</HI> Dutchess of <HI>Suffolk</HI>) who was a <HI>Protestant</HI>▪ the Council Proclaimed the Lady <HI>Jane</HI> Queen, which Proclamation sets forth, that the late King had settled the Crown as aforesaid, and declared, that it should not descend to his two Sisters, since they were both Illegitimate in the <HI>Spiritual Courts,</HI> and by <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and were only his Sisters by the half blood, who (tho' it were granted they had been Legiti∣mate) are not Inheritable by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> it was added, that there was also great cause to fear, that the King's Sisters might marry Strangers, and so change the Laws of the Kingdom, and subject it to the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and other Foreign Laws; for these Reasons they were excluded from the <HI>Succession,</HI> and the said Lady <HI>Jane</HI> was Proclaimed Queen as aforesaid, she promising to be most Benign and Gracious to all her people, to maintain God's Holy Word, and the Lavvs of the Land, requiring all the Subjects to obey and acknowledge her. And now all had been well, and the Reformed Religion was in a likely way to flourish, could the <HI>Protestants</HI> have been all of a mind, and the common sort of People been as well

The Earls of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> raised Forces and joyned with her, so did the sons of the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> and <HI>Mordant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist.

<P>A wonderful Mercy to her! What returns to God Almighty the Author, and to the <HI>Suffolk</HI> men the Instruments hereof? Why the first thing was, secret consultations for the overthrowing the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> and introducing the <HI>Popish</HI>; however, there must be something externally done, that may induce people to believe the con∣trary; and therefore <HI>August</HI> the 12<HI>th,</HI> the <HI>Queen declares</HI> in Council, that altho' her Conscience was stayed in the matters of Religion, yet she was resolved not to compel or strain others, otherwise than as God should put into their hearts a per∣swasion of that truth she was in, and this she hoped should be done by the opening his word to them, by Godly, Learned, and Vertuous <HI>Preachers.</HI></P>
<P>And well she kept this <HI>Declaration,</HI> for the next thing that she did, was to <HI>inhibit</HI> all Preaching, so that they were like to be prevail'd with by Preaching, to be of the Queen's Perswasion.</P>
<P>But let us see how the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> men were requited for their kindness to her, in hazarding their Lives and Estates, (if not their Souls) for her; why,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Requital.</NOTE> they of the <HI>Protestants,</HI> presuming upon what they had merited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist.

This was thought insolent, and she return'd no other answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Popish Head of a Protestant Church.</NOTE> but that they being Members thought to rule her who was their <HI>Head,</HI> but they should learn, the Members ought to obey the Head, and not to think to bear rule over it; and as an instance of it, she ordered one of them, whose name was <HI>Dobb,</HI> to stand three daies in the Pillory, and afterwards the <HI>Suffolk</HI> men were the first in her Reign, that tasted of the burning for <HI>Heresie.</HI> Neither was she any kinder to Judge <HI>Hale,</HI> (who was the only Judge of the twelve that declared for her) for he, in his charge in the Circuit in <HI>Kent,</HI> requiring an Execution of the Laws made in King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>'s Days, which were still in force and unrepealed, was first committed to the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> afterwards to the <HI>Fleet,</HI> where being distracted, attempted to have killed himself with a Pen-knife, and, being afterwards upon his submission discharged, never came to his Wits, but drowned himself; from these things it was then said (with a great deal of truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Case of the Bishop of <HI>Lon∣don, Magdalen</HI> Colledge, the Judges <HI>Hol∣loway</HI> and <HI>Powel,</HI> and the Officers in the Army in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> the <HI>2</HI>d.

<P>These things together with Imprisoning divers of the <HI>Protestant Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Mini∣sters</HI> of Parishes, were done from her entrance in <HI>July</HI> to <HI>October</HI> following, in the which Month she was Crowned, and having before summoned a <HI>Parliament,</HI> the same opened the 10<HI>th</HI> day of the same Month of <HI>October,</HI> (according to Doctor <HI>Burnet</HI>) but the 5<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October</HI> according to <HI>Rastal</HI> and <HI>Keeble</HI>'s Statutes.</P>
<P>In the first Session of this Parliament, a Law was made, to repeal and take away certain Treasons, Felonies, and Premunires, introduced with a most specious Pream∣ble; which is this,</P>

<P>By this Parliament another worse Law was made, whereby it was Enact∣ed, <HI>that if any Person should pray, or desire that God would shorten the Queens Days, or take her out of the Way, or any such Malicious Prayer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>1 2</HI> Ph. <HI>and</HI> Mary ca. <HI>9.

<P>I find no more Laws made in her time relating to <HI>Religion,</HI> and indeed one would think that the Repeal of the Laws that were made for the Establishing the Refor∣mation, and the reviving all the Bloody Laws that were made against the <HI>Prote∣stants,</HI> together with the additional ones above mentioned, had been sufficient to have gratified the most Barbarous, Blood-thirsty, and Cruel Tyrant: But, (O <HI>Popery</HI>) when wilt thou be satisfied with Cruelties?

This startled the <HI>Bishops,</HI> since it was now plain, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> disowned these extream Courses, and hereupon there was a stop for several Weeks put to any further severities: But the <HI>Popish Clergy,</HI> being once engaged in Blood, have been always observed, to become the most <HI>Brutally</HI> cruel of any sort of men, so that it was not easie to restrain them, and therefore they Resolved rather than the <HI>Hereticks,</HI> (<HI>i. e.

But notwithstanding all these Instru∣ments of Cruelty they had framed, they could not be satisfied unless they rai∣sed it to the very height of all Barbarity, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> did ever pretend to; and that was the setting up the <HI>Inquisition</HI> here in <HI>England</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>A Commission extraordinary, for proceeding against the Pro∣testants.</P><P><HI>Hist. Ref. pt. 2.</HI> fol. <HI>247.</HI></P></NOTE> and in <HI>February</HI> 1557. they had made a good step towards it, for a Commission was given to divers Popish Lords, Spiritual and Temporal, and others, which men∣tions, that since many false Rumors were published amongst the Subjects, and many <HI>Heretical (i. e.</HI> Protestant) Opinions, were also spread among them, there∣fore they or any three of them, were to enquire into those, either by Present∣ments, by Witnesses, or any other Politick Way they could Devise, and to search after all <HI>Heresies,</HI> the Bringers in, the Sellers, or Readers of all <HI>Heretical</HI> Books, they were to Examin and Punish all Misbehaviours, or negligences in any Church, or Chappel, and to try all Priests, that did not preach of the Sacra∣ment of the Altar, all Persons that did not hear <HI>Mass,</HI> or come to their Pa∣rish Church to Service; that would not go in Procession, or did not take Holy Bread, or Holy Water. And if they found any that did obstinately persist in such <HI>Heresies,</HI> they were to put them into the hands of their Ordinaries, to be proceeded against according to the Laws, giving them full power to proceed, as their Discretions and Consciences should direct them, and to use all such means as they could invent, for the searching of the premises, empowring them also, to call before them such Witnesses, as they pleased, and to Force them to make Oath of such things, as might discover what they sought after.

It shews how high they intended to raise the Persecution, when a Power of such a Nature, was put into the hands of any three of a number so selected. Besides this, there were many subordinate Commissions issued out, and after this a Commission was given to the Archbishop, the Bishop <HI>suffragan</HI> of <HI>Hull,</HI> and divers others, to the same effect, but with this limitation, that if any thing appeared to them, so intricate that they could not determine it, they were to refer it to the <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg1">Bonner.</NOTE> Bishop of <HI>London</HI> and his Collegues; who had a much larger Commission (and great reason he should, because they were sure he would spare none that came before him.) And now all was done that could be devised, for extirpating of <HI>Heresie,</HI> except Courts of Inquisition had been set up, which doubtless had been done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Death. <HI>Fox.</HI></NOTE> had that <HI>Blood-sucking</HI> Queen lived a little longer.

Ref. <HI>pt.</HI> 2. <HI>fol.</HI> 364.</NOTE> that he that writ the Preface to <HI>Bishop Ridley</HI>'s Book, <HI>de Carne Domini,</HI> who is supposed to be <HI>Grin∣dal,</HI> afterwards <HI>Arch-bishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> says, that in the two first years of this Queens Persecution, there were above 800 put to most cruel kinds of Death for Religion. By which it seems, <HI>Fox</HI> hath come far short in his account.</P>
<P>I cannot omit the Account that Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> gives, of the Method,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Methods of the Persecution of Protestants in this Reign.</NOTE> of the Perse∣cutions of this Reign. Saith he, <HI>At first the Bishops dealt earnestly with those that were brought before them, to recant; and were ready at any time to receive them: The Queens Pardon was also sent to them as they were ready to be tyed to the Stake, if they would then turn. But now it was far otherwise. For in the Council Books there is an Entry made of a Letter, written the</HI> 1st. <HI>of</HI> August 1558, <HI>to Sir</HI> Richard Pexhall, <HI>Sheriff of</HI> Hampshire, <HI>signifying, That the Queen thought it very strange, that he had delayed the Execution of one</HI> Bembridge, <HI>Condemned of Heresie, because he had re∣canted; Requiring him to Execute it out of hand, and if he still continued in the Catho∣lick Faith, which he outwardly pretended, he was then to suffer such Divines as the Bi∣shop of</HI> Winchester <HI>should appoint, to have access to him for confirming him in the Faith, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on him at his Death, that he might dye God's Servant. And as soon as the</HI> Sheriff <HI>had thus burnt him, he was to come to the Council, and answer for his Pre∣sumption in deferring it so long. The matter of Fact was thus:</HI> Bembridge <HI>being had to the Stake, and the Fire taking hold of him, he through the violence of it yielded, and cryed out, I recant; upon which, the Sheriff made the Fire to be put out, and</HI> Bembridge <HI>signed such a Recantation, as Dr.</HI> Seton, <HI>who was near him, writ for him:</HI> But for all that, upon this Order of Council, he was burnt; and the Sheriff was put in the <HI>Fleet.</HI> So that now it appeared, that it was not so much the Conver∣sion of those they called <HI>Hereticks,</HI> as their Destruction, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> desired: and I think, the Instance of Burning Arch <HI>Bishop Cranmer,</HI> after he had recanted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Ref. <HI>pt.</HI> 2. <HI>fol.</HI> 333.</NOTE> upon the Promise of a Pardon, is as pregnant an instance, as this; which you may see related by Dr. <HI>Burnet Hist. Ref. part</HI> 2. <HI>fol.</HI> 333.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="12"/>And sure it will be no wonder, that there was such a severe Persecution during this Reign:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Ref. <HI>2</HI> pt. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.370, 371.</HI></NOTE> If it be considered, that the <HI>Bishops,</HI> besides the other Cannons binding them to proceed against them they called <HI>Hereticks</HI>; were by the words of the Oath of Obedience, which they sware to the Pope at their Consecration, engaged to op∣pose and persecute the <HI>Hereticks</HI> with all their might; so that their giving severe Counsels, and the Queens following them, flowed mainly from the Principles of their Religion; (and can any thinking man imagine they are altered since?) in which the sowerness of the Queen's Temper, made it the more easie to perswade her to a compliance to those courses to which her own inclinations led her, without any such motives.</P>
<P>And now they that can expect any better usage from the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and Prelates of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> under a Prince of that perswasion, must, I think, have for∣feited their Reason, and are fitter to converse with <HI>Wolves</HI> and <HI>Tygers,</HI> than men, much less the most refined of them, those who are sincerely of the Reformed Re∣ligion, commonly called <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>My design in being thus long in setting forth the cruel Penal Laws that were made or revived, and put in Execution in this Reign, was, that the Reader might com∣pare the Penal Laws in <HI>Edward</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI>'s time, with the Penal Laws in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s, and then judge, whether his are not merciful, compared with these, especially re∣specting the Execution, there being not one put to Death for Religion in all King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI>'s Reign, that so the Moderation of the one may be admir'd, and the Cruelty of the other abhor'd: And not as any Reason, why the Penal Laws against the <HI>Papists,</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, were made upon such severe Penalties, for I shall shew that they were made upon quite different reasons, than in revenge (as the <HI>Papists</HI> maliciously suggest) for the severe usage of the <HI>Protestants</HI> in this Reign.</P>

<P>Thus stood the Laws, when that Glorious Queen (of ever Blessed Memory) as∣cended the <HI>Throne</HI>; and one would have thought, these would have guarded her against all attempts of the <HI>Papists,</HI> and 'tis not unreasonable to believe, that she her self was of that mind, if we consider,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ly,</HI> That the Methods taken by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for restoring the <HI>Protestant</HI> Re∣ligion▪ were much milder, than those taken by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> to introduce the <HI>Popish.</HI> This will appear by the Laws themselves, of which I come now to give an account, and of the occasion of their making.</P>
<P>The first is. <HI>That which restores to the Crown,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>1 Eliz.</HI> ca. <HI>1. Rast. Stat. 2.</HI> part. f. <HI>1.</HI></P><P>The Crown re∣stored to its An∣tient Jurisdicti∣on in causes Ec∣clesiastical, a power given to delegate the ex∣ercise of it; the Oath of Supre∣macy, and what shall be taken for Heresie ascer∣tained.</P></NOTE> <HI>the Antient Iurisdiction over the Estate Ecclesiastical and Spiritual, and abolisheth all Foreign Powers repugnant to the same: Which it doth by reviving the Laws of</HI> Henry <HI>the</HI> 8th <HI>against the See of</HI> Rome, <HI>and of</HI> Edward <HI>the</HI> 6th <HI>for the Protestants: Which Laws were repealed by Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>and Laws for Convicting and Burning Hereticks</HI> (i. e. <HI>Protestants</HI>) <HI>in an Arbitrary way re∣vived; which had been Repealed in</HI> Edward <HI>the</HI> 6th's <HI>time. This Law therefore parti∣cularly repeals</HI> 5 R. 2.5. 5 H. 4.15. 2 H. 5.7. <HI>made against the Protestants, then called Hereticks, and</HI> Lollards, <HI>and then doth abolish Foreign Iurisdiction,</HI> (wherein it is but declarative of the Antient Laws of the Kingdom) <HI>and annereth Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction to the Crown; and gives a power of delegating the Exercise of it; establisheth the Oath of Supremary</HI> (but in tenderness to the Papists, leaves out Supream Head of the Church) <HI>and provides that all Ecclesiastical Persons, Temporal Iudges, Iustices, Mayors, or other say or temporal Officers, and every other person having her Highness Fee or Wages, shall take the said Oath, upon the penalty of forfeiting their places Ecclesiastical or Temporal, upon an obstinate refusal, and disability to hold the same for the future, the penalty of maliciously maintaining a Foreign Iurisdiction, is, for the first offence, the loss of Goods and Chattels only, and if he be not worth</HI> 20 l. <HI>then over and above the forfeiture of his Goods and Chattels, he shall suffer twelve Months Imprisonment with∣out Bail or Mainprize, the second offence is made a premunire, the third offence high Treason. This Act declares what shall not, and what shall be Heresie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Ref. pt. <HI>2.</HI> ib. <HI>3.</HI> f. <HI>386.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that no matter of Re∣ligion or cause Ecclesiastical within this Act, shall be Heresie, Schism, or Schismatical O∣pinion, nor any thing, but what is so adjudged by the Canonical Scriptures, and the four first general Council, or other Councils, by the true and genuine sence of the Holy Scriptures, or what should afterwards be declared Heresie by the Parliament, with the consent of the Convocation.</HI></P>
<P>From which Act. I observe, that altho' it was a <HI>Premunire</HI> before this Law, to own a Foreign Jurisdiction, as bringing in Bulls doth, yet the Queen was willing to inflict a less punishment, for the first offence, to see if she could gain upon the <HI>Papists</HI> by Clemency▪ and made it not high Treason, till a conviction of the third offence, and that Conviction to be according to the Antient Laws of the Land, (and not in an Arbitrary way) which is much more mild, than any of the <HI>Popish</HI> Laws were, neither was this Law put in Execution against them, till they grew troublesome to the State, as I shall plainly make appear hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="13"/>The next Law was, for the uniformity of <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> and service in the Church, and administration of the Sacraments.

<P>By which Law it is provided, <HI>that spiritual persons that shall use any other service, or deprave, or speak against the use of that, for the first offence, being legally Con∣victed, shall lose the profits of his Benefice for a Year; and shall suffer six months Imprisonment; for the second Offence, shall be deprived</HI> ipso facto; <HI>for the third, not only deprived, but suffer Imprisonment during his Life; a Lay person offending in the Premisses, shall for the first Offence, suffer Imprisonment for a Year, without Bail or mainprize; and for the second Offence, shall suffer Imprisonment during Life. Every one that by Enterludes, Plays, Songs, Rhimes, or other open words, shall speak against any thing in derogation, depraving, or despising of the same Book, or shall any ways maintain any person,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in using any other Service,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>or shall hinder, or interrupt the use of this Book, For the first Offence, shall forfeit</HI> 100 Marks, <HI>for the second Offence</HI> 400 Marks, <HI>and for the third Offence, shall forfeit all his Goods and Chattels, and suffer Imprisonment during Life; and for</HI> non-<HI>payment of the</HI> 100 Marks <HI>in</HI> 6 <HI>Weeks after his Conviction, shall suffer six Months Imprisonment, and for</HI> non-<HI>payment of the</HI> 400 Marks, <HI>shall suffer</HI> 12 <HI>Months Imprisonment, without Bail or Mainprize.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All persons are by this Act required, having no reasonable Excuse, to resort to their Parish Church, or upon reasonable Let, to some other place, where the service is u∣sed, upon Sundays, and Holy-days, upon the Penalty of punishment, by the Cen∣sures of the Church, and</HI> 12 d. <HI>for every Default. And for due Execution of this Act, the Queen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">il <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean trying the Bishops for being guilty of a Misdemeanor, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not complying with a Popish Prince against this Law be justified?</NOTE> <HI>the Lords Temporal, and all the Commons in that Parliament assembled, did in God's Name earnestly require, and charge the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and other Ordinaries, that they should endeavour themselves to the utmost of their knowledges, that the due and true Execution thereof might he had, throughout their Diocess, and charges, as they would answer before God, for such Evils and Plagues, wherewith Almighty God might Iustly punish his People, for neglecting that good and wholsome Law.</HI></P>
<P>All Laws for other Service are hereby made void.</P>
<P>But may the <HI>Papists</HI> say, Are not imprisonment, Premunire, and High Treason very great Penalties? What Greater? To this I answer, That there is not any of them inflicted for the first Offence; But punishment for the first offence is still but a pecuniary molct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Penalty an∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to this Law justified.</NOTE> and extends to neither Pillory, Loss of Ears, striking off hands, or death, much less death by Fire and Fagor. The second Offence is re∣straint of Liberty, and that but Temporary, except in one single Case, where it is for Life.</P>
<P>The punishment for the first Offence, is no where made a Premunire▪ nor Trea∣son; and 'tis but in one case, that the Party offending, is made Guilty of High Treason, and that is upon being Convicted of the third Offence too, and for that very Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, the Party incurr'd a <HI>Premunire</HI> by the Law before; And if it be granted me▪ that it is necessary that some kind of Penalties be annexed, to inforce obedience to Laws, which certainly cannot be denyed, these being such gradual Penalties, the <HI>Papists</HI> themselves cannot but own, that they are reasonable.</P>

<P><HI>That if any person dwelling, inhabiting, or resiant within the Queens Dominions, should after</HI> 1 Apr. 1563▪ <HI>by writing,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>advisedly, and wittingly hold,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>maintain, or defend the Authority, Iurisdiction, or Power of the Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>or of his See, heretofore usurped within this Realm, being lawfully Convicted thereof within a Year, should incur a Premunire for the first Offence, and High Treason for the Second; the like Penalties are annexed to the Refusal of the Oath of Supremacy. The reason of the making</HI> which Law appears from the Preamble of the Act, and the History of those times.</P>
<P>The Preamble takes notice, <HI>that Hures, Perils, Dishonours, Inconveniences, had be∣fore time befallen the Queens Majesties Noble Progenitors, Kings of this Realm, and the whole estate thereof by means of the Jurisdiction of the See of</HI> Rome, <HI>unjustly claimed, and usurped within this Realm, and the Dominions thereof, and also takes notice of Dan∣gers the Queen and state was then in, by the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters of the said usurped Power, at that time grown to marvellous outrage, and Licentious Boldness, and therefore it was
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
necessary to have more sharp restraint, and correction of Laws, then before in the time of the Queens Majesties most mild, and merciful Reign had been establish'd.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it plainly appears, that the <HI>Parliament</HI> thought the Queens Person, and the Kingdom in great Danger from the <HI>Papists,</HI> who are all favourers of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Authority in <HI>England,</HI> and if <HI>Cambden</HI> may be believed, not without reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambd Annals <HI>fol.</HI> 58.</NOTE> for he tells us, That <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1562 in <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Professors</HI> of the <HI>Reformed Religion</HI> were most grievously afflicted: And that thereupon the <HI>Papists</HI> in <HI>England</HI> muttered many and Great matters in secret talk amongst Companies, of suppres∣sing in like manner the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> And every one that is acquainted with the History of those times, knows, that at the same time that these things were bruited about, the <HI>Papists</HI> here, the <HI>Guises</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> (that restless and unwearied Enemy of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion) were plotting and Con∣triving against the Queen, and that those Plots and Contrivances of the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> were never at an end, till the Axe put a period to her Life and them together.</P>
<P>And how forward the Priests of the <HI>Romish Church,</HI> especially of the Order of <HI>Jesuits,</HI> are, to assert the <HI>Pope's</HI> jurisdiction, and bring in and Execute his <HI>Bulls</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> is well known amongst <HI>Protestants.</HI> And that this is laid by the secu∣lar Priests themselves to the Charge of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> I shall hereafter make appear. So that certainly it must be owned, that there was very good reason to make this Law; and as for the Penalties, they were annexed <HI>in terrorem,</HI> rather, than with any design to be inflicted to the ruine of them, against whom the Laws were made, as plainly appears from the History of the first 12 years of this Queens Reign, during which time, the Persons of the <HI>Papists,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queens mild usage of the Pa∣pists.</NOTE> (notwithstanding these Laws) remained in the Kingdom quiet, and undisturbed, till they themselves gave just occasion, for putting these, and the Antient Laws of the Kingdom in Execution against them, and making further provision by the adding new Laws, with more severe Penalties, or rather inforcing the Execution of the old ones. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg1"><P><HI>Foulis Hist.</HI> of Romish Trea∣sons. li. <HI>7.</HI> cap. <HI>2.</HI> fol. <HI>325.</HI></P><P>The secular Priests in their important consi∣derations, con∣fess not above <HI>12</HI> in <HI>10</HI> years, and of those <HI>12,</HI> some were attainted of Treason. <HI>Col∣lections f. 41.</HI> Lord Treasurer <HI>Burleigh</HI> hasserts the same <HI>f. 28.

Papists</HI>) was tollerable, and after a sort in some good quietness; such as for their Consciences, were impri∣soned in the beginning of her coming to the Crown, were very kindly and mercifully used, the state of things then considered▪ some of them were appoin∣ted to remain with such their Friends, as they themselves made choice of. Others were placed, some with <HI>Bishops,</HI> some with Deans, and had their Dyet at their Ta∣bles, with such convenient Lodgings and Walks for their Recreations, as did well content them. They that were in the ordinary Prisons, had such Liberty and other Commodity, as the places would afford, not inconvenient for men in their Cases. But that our Brethren of the more fiery and Jesuitical Humour may not snuff here∣at; we have thought it meet to cool their heat, with some of Master <HI>Parsons,</HI> and his Fellow Mr. <HI>Creswel</HI>'s more gentle delaies (then are usual with them:) who in one of their Books do confess as much in effect, as here we have set down, if not more, thus those great <HI>Emperor-like Jesuits,</HI> do speak to her Majesty. <HI>In the begin∣ning of thy Kingdom, thou didst deal something more gently with Catholicks: None were then urged by thee, or pressed either to thy Sect, or to the denyal of their Faith, all things (indeed) did seem to proceed in a far milder course: no great complaints were heard of: there were seen no extraordinary contentions or repugnancies; some there were, that to please and gratifie you, went to your Churches, but when afterwards thou didst begin to wrong them,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And thus, not only our own <HI>Historians,</HI> do acquit Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of all imputa∣tions of Rigour, or cruelty towards the <HI>Papists,</HI> for the beginning of her Reign, but even the Secular <HI>Priests,</HI> not only do it themselves, but have Printed and published it to all the world, that the Jesuits themselves, <HI>Parsons</HI> and <HI>Creswel,</HI> could not but acknowledge it too.</P>
<P><Q>And when was it that she began to be severe?

<P>After this, in the same year, <HI>Robert Rodolph,</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> who had lived long time as a Factor in <HI>London,</HI> was imployed by <HI>Pius Quintus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> (for he durst not send his Nuntio openly) to excite the <HI>Papists</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> secretly against Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which he most carefully and closely performed. And this same Pope writ a Letter to the Earls of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Westmerland,</HI> which had such success, that the latter end of 1569, a Rebellion of the <HI>Papists</HI> broke out in the <HI>North,</HI> fomented and carryed on by one <HI>Nicholas Morton,</HI> a Priest, who was sent from the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> to pronounce Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to be an Heretick, and there∣by to have forfeited all Dominion and Power. The Ring-Leaders of the Rebels, being the <HI>Earls</HI> of <HI>Northumberland, Westmerland,</HI> and <HI>Sussex.</HI> The Rebels went first to <HI>Durham</HI> an Episcopal See, where they rent and trampled under feet, the <HI>English Bibles,</HI> and <HI>Books of Common Prayer,</HI> which they found in Churches, and Cele∣brated <HI>Mass</HI> in all places where they came, their number was <HI>six hundred Horse,</HI> and <HI>four thousand Foot.</HI> But this Rebellion was quickly suppressed, threescore and six petty Constables hanged for a terror at <HI>Durham</HI>; amongst whom the men of most note, was one <HI>Plomtree</HI> a Priest, <HI>Simon Digby, John Fulthorp, Thomas Bishop,</HI> and <HI>Robert Peneman</HI> at <HI>York</HI>; and at <HI>London</HI> some few months after, <HI>Christopher</HI> and <HI>Thomas Nor∣ton,</HI> and some few elsewhere.</P>

These mens Convictions and Proscriptions, was confirmed in the next Parliament. The rest, which had no Estates, nor had fled the Land, (as the Earl of <HI>Westmerland</HI> and several others did) were pardoned; not taken and hanged like <HI>Dogs</HI> in <HI>Cold-Blood,</HI> without Tryal, as many hundreds were in the <HI>West</HI> in 1685.</P>

<P>BY your Letters dated to us, the eighth day of <HI>November,</HI> (which being brought to us the eighth of <HI>February,</HI> we have speedily returned Answer) understanding more certainly and particularly, the Miseries and Calamities of that most flourishing Kingdom, not unknown to us before, we were affected with that grief of mind, wherewith both the Indignity of these Evils which we suffer
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
in you, and Our Paternal Affection towards both you and other Catholicks in that Kingdom, ought to affect us; for besides that Common Duty of Pastoral Charity, wherewith we ought to rejoice at the Welfare, or to be grieved at the Calamity of all the Faithful of Christ, and of every Province in which the Christian Name is professed, we are affected with an Episcopal prerogative of Love and Benevolence towards that Kingdom, both because We remember it was heretofore by the Labour and Industry of our Predecessor, the Blessed <HI>Gregory</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> (next after God Omnipotent) Converted from the Worship of Wood and Stones, to the Christian Faith; and by fit Men sent thither from him, instituted in Manners, and in the Catholick Doctrine, and also because it used to exhibit to the Apostolick See, an excellent Faith and sincerity of Devotion; therefore how much we grieve and are troubled at these your Evils, and the Evils of that Kingdom, which you in the same Letters no less Truely than Miserably Lament, cannot easily be exprest in Words. We grieve that so many and so great Poisonous Infections of wicked Heresies, and so deadly Wounds of the Christian Common-Wealth, should chiefly happen in the times of Our <HI>Pontificate</HI>: We are troubled, because We are Compelled to be Solicitous about the Danger of you and other Catholicks; but yet when We remember the Power of his Prayers, who entreated for St. <HI>Peter, that his Faith might not fail</HI>; and who enlarging his Church in Tribulation, does by so much the more admirably govern it by the Providence of his secret Council, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much the more he sees it tossed by the Waves of Troubles. We de∣spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not, but what we have heard to have been done in former times, may also by the Divine assistance, be done in ours. That the Church which often seems by the prevailing Persecution of <HI>Hereticks</HI> to be trodden down, may re∣turn to its State of Antient Felicity, (the Lord Conspiring with her to a good Omen) and may receive encrease from that wherein she seemed to have suffe∣red Loss. For Behold, even now, he that of old things makes new ones, and of new things old ones, Our Lord Jesus Christ hath by you, (Men, Dear to Ʋs, and Eminent, as well by the Study of Catholick Piety, as by Nobleness of Birth) determined, peradventure to renew and confirm the Antient Ʋnion of the Romish Church, with that Kingdom; and therefore hath infused into you that mind, most worthy of the Zeal of your Catholick Faith, that you should attempt to reduce back that Kingdom (delivered from the most vile Servitude of a Womans Lust) to the Antient Obedience of this Holy <HI>Roman</HI> See, which Pi∣ous and Religious endeavour of your Minds, We recommend (as is fit) with just Praises in the Lord, and giving it that Our Blessing, which you desire; We do with the Benignity which becomes us, receive your Honours flying to the Power and Protection of us, and of this Holy See, to whose Authority they Subject themselves; exhorting you in the Lord, and with all possible earnestness of Our Mind, entreating you to Persevere constantly in this your so exceeding good will and lawdable Purpose: Being assured that the Omnipotent God, whose Works are Perfect, and who hath excited you to deserve well of the Ca∣tholick Faith in that Kingdom, will be assisting to you. But if in asserting the Catholick Faith, and Authority of this Holy See; you should suffer Death, and your Blood be spilt, it would be much better for the Confession of God, to flye by the Compendium of a Glorious Death to Life Eternal, than living Basely and Ignominiously, to serve the Lust of an Impotent Woman, with the Loss of your Souls. For think not, Beloved Sons in Christ, that those Catho∣lick Bishops, or Princes of that Kingdom whom you name, are ill dealt with, who because they would not forsake the Profession of the Catholick Faith, are either Imprisoned, or undeservedly affected with other Punishments, for the Constancy of these Men, which is even now confirmed by a new Example (as we conceive) of the Blessed <HI>Thomas,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> no man can sufficiently commend, as it deserves. This same Constancy, you also imitating; be
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>
of a Couragious and Constant mind, and desist not from the Enterprize by any Threats or denunciation of Danger. For God in whom you ought to repose your Trust, who did cast the Chariot and Army of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> into the Sea, is able to break the Strength and Power of his Adversaries; so that by you, the Pri∣mitive Religion and Ancient dignity of that Realm may be restored, which that it may be Compassed, we shall not only help you in performing with those Chri∣stian Princes whom you would, those Offices which you desire, but also in Con∣tributing at present, that Sum of Money, which according to our Ability, in answer to your Request, We can supply you with, as you shall more clearly and fully understand by our Beloved Son <HI>Robert Rodolphus,</HI> We being also ready to endeavour hereafter to contribute a Greater Sum than the Imbecility of Our Power will bear, and with a ready and chearful Mind to help your Pious Endea∣vour, with all our Estate and Power, which We can in the Lord.</P>

<P>And as the <HI>Papists</HI> gave Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> these disturbances here in <HI>England</HI>; so they were not wanting in Embroiling of <HI>Ireland</HI>: So ungrateful were they for all the favour and kindness, that she had from time to time shewn them. <HI>Edmond</HI> and <HI>Peter Boteler,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s Brethren, engaged themselves with the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> for maintaining the Popish Religion, and outing Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of her Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI> But their Brother the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> quench∣ed this Flame, by perswading his Brethren to submit themselves, who by that means saved their Lives.</P>
<P>And no wonder it is, that the <HI>Papists</HI> thus Rebel against Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; when <HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> who had from the time he came to the See, been con∣tinually plotting against her, had the year before by his Bull declaratory, with∣out any previous admonition, or Citation, excommunicated her, and did afterwards cause the same to be openly published, and set up upon the Gates of the Bishop of <HI>Londons</HI> Palace, in these words.</P>

<HEAD>A Sentence Declaratory of our Holy Lord Pope <HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> against <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Queen of <HI>England,</HI> and the Hereticks adhering unto her, wherein also all her Subjects are decla∣red to be absolved from the Oath of Allegiance, and whatever other Duty they owe unto her: And those that from henceforth shall obey her, are involved in the same Curse or Anathema.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Pius, Bishop,</HI> Servant to God's Servants, for a future Memorial of the matter.</P>
<P>He that raigneth on high, to whom is given all Power in Heaven and in Earth, hath Committed his one, Holy, Catholick, and Apostolick Church, out of which there is no Sal∣vation, to one alone upon Earth, namely, To <HI>Peter</HI> the Chief of the Apostles, and to <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>'s Successor, the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> to be by him govern'd with plenary Authority. Him alone hath he made Prince over all People, and all Kingdoms, to pluck up, destroy, scatter, consume, plant, and build; that he may preserve his faithful People, (knit together with
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>
the band of Charity) in the Ʋnity of the Spirit, and present them spotless and unblamable to their Saviour. In discharge of which Function, we, who are by God's Goodness so called to the Government of the aforesaid Church, do spare no pains, labouring with all earnestness, that unity and the Catholick Religion, (which the Author thereof hath for the tryal of his Chil∣drens Faith, and for our amendment suffered to be tossed with so great Afflictions) might be preserved sincere. But the number of the ungodly hath gotten such power, that there is now no place in the whole world left, which they have not assayed to corrupt with their most wicked Doctrines, and amongst others, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the pretended Queen of <HI>England,</HI> the Servant of Wickedness, lendeth thereunto her helping hand, with whom, as in a Sanctuary, the most perni∣cious persons have found a refuge. This very Woman having seized on the Kingdom, and monstrously usurped the place of Supream Head of the Church in all <HI>England,</HI> and the chief Authority and Jurisdiction thereof; hath again reduced the said Kingdom into a miserable and ruinous condition, which was so lately reclaimed to the Catholick Faith and a thriving Condition.</P>
<P>For having by strong hand prohibited the exercise of the true Religion, which <HI>Mary</HI> the law∣ful Queen of Famous Memory, had by the help of this See restored, after it had been former∣ly overthrown by <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, a Revolter there-from, and following and embracing the Errors of Hereticks, she hath changed the Royal Council, consisting of the <HI>English</HI> Nobi∣lity, and filled it up with obscure Men, being Hereticks; suppressed the Embracers of the Catholick Faith; Constituted lewd Preachers and Ministers of Impiety; Abolished the Sacri∣fice of the Mass, Prayers, Fastings, choice of Meats, unmarried Life, and the Catholick Rites and Ceremonies; commanded Books to be read through the whole Realm, containing manifest Heresie, and appointed Impious Rites and Institutions, by her self entertained and observed according to the Prescript of <HI>Calvin,</HI> to be likewise observed by her Subjects; pre∣sumed to eject Bishops, Parsons of Churches, and other Catholick Priests, out of their Churches and Benefices, and to bestow them and other Church Livings upon Hereticks, and to determine of Church Causes; prohibited the Prelates, Clergy, and People, to acknowledge the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or obey the Precepts or Canonical Sanctions thereof; compelled most of them to con∣descend to her wicked Laws, and to abjure the Authority and Obedience of the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and to acknowledge her to be sole Lady in Temporal and Spiritual Matters, and this by Oath; imposed Penalties and Punishments upon those which obeyed not, and exacted them of those which persevered in the Ʋnity of the Faith, and their Obedience aforesaid; cast the Catholick Prelates and Rectours of Churches into Prison, where many of them, being worn out with long languishing and sorrow, miserably ended their Lives: All which things being so manifest and notorious to all Nations, and by the serious Testimony of very many so substantially proved, that there is no place at all left for excuse, defense or evasion: We seeing that Impiety and Wicked Actions are multiplyed one upon another, as also that the Persecution of the Faithful and Affli∣ction for Religion groweth every day heavier and heavier, through the instigation and by means of the said <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and since we understand her Heart to be so hardened and obdurate, that she hath not only contemned the Godly Requests and Admonitions of Catholick Princes, concer∣ning her cure and Conversion, but also hath not so much as suffered the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncio's of this See to cross the Seas for this purpose into <HI>England,</HI> are constrained of necessity to betake our selves to the Weapons of Justice against her, being heartily grieved and sorry that we are compelled thus to punish one, to whose Ancestors the whole State of Christendom hath been so much be∣holden. Being therefore supported with his Authority whose pleasure it was to place us (tho' unable for so great a burthen) in this Supream Throne of Justice, we do, out of the fulness of our Apostolick Power, declare, the aforesaid <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as being an Heretick and a fa∣vourer of Hereticks, and her adherents in the matters aforesaid, to have incurr'd the Sen∣tence of Excommunication, and to be cut off from the unity of the body of Christ. And more∣over we do declare her to be deprived of her pretended Title to the Kingdom aforesaid, and of all Dominion, Dignity, and Priviledge whatsoever; and also the Nobility, Subjects, and People of the said Kingdom, and all others who have in any sort sworn unto her, to be for ever absolved from any such Oath, and all manner of Duty of Dominion, Allegiance and Obe∣dience: and we also do by Authority of these Presents absolve them, and do deprive the said <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of her pretended Title to the Kingdom, and all other things before named. And we do command and charge all and every the Noblemen, Subjects, People, and others afore∣said, that they presume not to obey her, or her Orders, Mandates and Laws: And those which shall do the contrary, we do include them in the like Sentence of Anathema. And because it would be a difficult matter, to convey these Presents to all places wheresoever it shall be need∣ful; Our Will is, that the Copies thereof under a Publick Notaries hand, and Sealed with the Seal of an Ecclesiastical Prelate, or of his Court, shall carry altogether the same credit with

<P>It appears by Letters from the Pope to the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> written in the year 1571. 13 <HI>Eliz.</HI> that there was a design on Foot to introduce <HI>Popery</HI> and to subvert the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion here in <HI>England,</HI> which Letter was delivered by <HI>Ridolpho</HI> the <HI>Flo∣rentine,</HI> before mentioned, his means to the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>: And <HI>Ridolpho</HI> by his own particular Letters to the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> desired her to acquaint the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and her Friends with the Design, but there being at that time a Treaty begun, in order to her being restored to her Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> whereof she was at that time dispos∣sest, she defer'd answering the Letter; but the Treaty afterwards coming to nothing, she privately sent a large commentary or draught of her Counsels and Affairs to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> before mentioned, written in Cyphers, known only to them two; as also other Letters to be conveyed by <HI>Ridolpho</HI> to the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camd.</HI> Hist. lib. <HI>2.</HI> fol. <HI>157.

<P>The Commentary of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> before mentioned, being afterwards disco∣vered, there the Design appearing, I have inserted what <HI>Cambden</HI> saith she therein discoursed, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the <HI>French</HI> approved of the Conference begun with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and yet propounded the Marriage of the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and that to no other end, but that they might have the better pretence to deny the aid promised for her Restitution. That the same <HI>French</HI> privately opposed her Marriage with <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> and highly favoured that with <HI>Norfolk,</HI> in hatred to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> That the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> did so far condemn the Design, for sending back the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> that he thought it to be atten∣ded with the utter undoing of the Queen, and the overthrow of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Re∣ligion in <HI>Britain</HI>; for the Queen being returned into <HI>Scotland,</HI> must of necessity ei∣ther undergo the danger of being besieged, or else hazard a Battel with the Re∣bels, who with the help of the <HI>English,</HI> would soon get her into their power, before any foreign Forces could come to her assistance. Seeing then she could not be safe in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from <HI>France</HI> there was swall hope, that being embroiled with Wars within it self, he thought it her best Course to fly to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> help, who had proffered her Marriage with <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> (which, notwith∣standing she would refuse, having given her Faith that the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion in <HI>Brit∣tain,</HI> should be restored by <HI>Norfolk</HI>:) as also that her Son should be forthwith con∣veyed out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and sent into <HI>Spain</HI>; for so he would be kept in safety, and instructed in the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, from his very Childhood, and withal all pre∣tences would be taken from the <HI>Scots,</HI> who Cloaked their Rebellion under his Name.

<P><PB N="29" REF="17"/>I confess that <HI>Keble</HI> saith in his Collection of Statutes, that this Act of Parliament is expired, but what ground he hath for it, appears not any where that I can find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keble.

<P>There was also another <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI> made in the same Session, the which is in∣tituled, <HI>an Act against the bringing in, and putting in execution of Bulls, writings, or Instruments, and other Superstitions from the See of</HI> Rome.</P>

And sets forth the effect of the said Bull herein before particularly set forth; and that by colour of the said Bulls, and Writings, the said wicked Persons very secretly, and most seditiously, in such parts of this Realm, where the People for want of Instruction, were most weak, simple, and ignorant, and there∣by, furthest from the good understanding of their Duty towards God, &amp; the Queen, had by their Lewd and subtle Practices, and Perswasions, so far wrought, that sundry persons had been re∣conciled to the said usurpt Authority of the See of</HI> Rome, <HI>and did take Absolution at the hands of the said naughty and subtle Practicers; whereby there was grown great disobe∣dience, and boldness in many, not only to withdraw, and absent themselves from all Di∣vine Service; but also did think themselves discharged from all Obedience, Duty, and Allegiance to her Majesty, that thereupon most wicked and unnatural Rebellion had ensued, and to the further danger of this Realm, was likely to be renewed, if the ungodly attempts in that behalf, were not by severity of Laws restrained and bridled</HI>: This Law therefore provides, <HI>that they who by Bulls, or other Instruments of the Bishop of</HI> Rome; <HI>should re∣concile any person to the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>and those also who should be so reconciled, should incur the Penalty of High Treason.

<P>From the precedent History of Fact, and the Preamble of these two Acts of Parliament, and the Acts themselves, I observe three things.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> That the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> is in it self a Free State; exempt from all Fo∣reign Jurisdiction whatever, by the Common Law of this Kingdom.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> That there had been deep Designs on foot, before the making of these Acts of Parliament, for the inslaving this Kingdom to the Bishop and See of <HI>Rome,</HI> subverting the Protestant Religion, and introducing Popery; and in order thereunto, there were several Plots laid to destroy the person of the Queen.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> That these were all laid and carried on by the <HI>Pope,</HI> and some Papists that were the Queens own Subjects, and others their adherents, and therefore certainly it must be granted that it was very necessary at that time to make these Laws against the Papists.</P>
<P>And that it was but reasonable to make them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Secular Priests own the Reasonableness of making these Laws.</P><P><HI>Collection</HI> of several Treatises concerning the reasons and oc∣casions of the Penal-Laws.

They confess that <HI>Pius</HI> V. did practise her Ma∣jesties subversion; that <HI>Ridolpho</HI> was sent hither by the <HI>Pope</HI> (under Colour of Merchan∣dize) to sollicit a Rebellion; That <HI>Pius</HI> V. moved the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to Joyn in this ex∣ploit; That the Bull was devised purposely to further the intended Rebellion, for de∣priving her Majesty from her Kingdom; That the <HI>Pope</HI> and King of <HI>Spain</HI> assigned the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> to be head of this Rebellion; That the <HI>Pope</HI> gave order to <HI>Ridolpho,</HI> to take 150000 Crowns to set forwards this Attempt. That some of this money was sent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and some delivered to the Duke; That King <HI>Philip,</HI> at the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Instance, de∣termined to send the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> with all his forces out of the <HI>Low-Coun∣tries,</HI> to assist the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; which they confess in this manner. That these things their Adversaries the <HI>Protestants</HI> Charged on them as true, and that they were in hand whilst her Majesty dealt so mercifully with them, and therefore ask'd them how they could excuse these designs so Unchristian, so unpriestly, so Treacherous, and so unprince-like? To which they answer, that when they first heard the aforementioned particu∣lars, they did not believe them, but would have laid their Lives they had been false; but
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>
when they saw them printed in the Life of <HI>Pius</HI> V, they appeal to God, they were ama∣zed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collection. f. <HI>37</HI></NOTE> and say, they can say no more, but that his Holiness was misinformed, and indirect∣ly drawn to these courses. They confess, that there being several persons in Prison, when the Rebellion in the <HI>North</HI> before mentioned brake forth, that it was known that the Pope had Excommunicated the Queen, that there followed a great restraint of the Pri∣soners, but none of them were put to death upon that occasion; the Sword being then only drawn against such Catholicks, as had risen up actually into open Rebellion, where∣in, say they, we cannot see what her Majesty did, that any Prince in Christendom, in such a case, would not have done, and confess these things to have been the occasion of making 13 <HI>Eliz. ca.</HI> 2. against bringing in Buls <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thus they express themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collection. f. <HI>38.</HI></NOTE> <HI>we cannot but con∣fess, as reasonable men, that the State had great Reasons to make some Laws against us, except they should have shown themselves careless for the continuance of it, but be the Law, as any would have it, never so extream, yet surely it must be granted, that the occasions of it were most outragious, and likewise that the Execution of it was not so Tragical, as many have since written and reported of it; for whatsoever was done against us, either upon the pretence of that Law, or of any other, would never we think have been attempted, had not divers other preposterous occasions, besides the Causes of that Law, daily fallen out amongst us, which procured matters to be urged more se∣verely against us.</HI> And afterwards they accuse <HI>Saunders</HI> the <HI>Jesuit</HI> for writing a Book in 1572, <HI>de visibili Monarchia,</HI> and therein justifying the Excommunicating the Queen, and the said Rebellion in the <HI>North,</HI> and do themselves own, that the persons that suffered upon that account, were Arraigned, Condemned, and Executed, by the Antient Laws of the Country, for High Treason.</P>
<P>As to the Acts themselves, It is not to be denyed, but they are very severe, yet not severe enough to deter the Papists from carrying on their designs against the Queen, and the Protestant Religion, as I shall by and by make appear; but before I do that, let us a little enquire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Story<HI>'s</HI> Plot. <HI>Cambd.

<P>In the year 1572,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Camb. Annals <HI>fol.</HI> 188.</P><P>Baker's <HI>Chron. f.</HI> 347.</P></NOTE> the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was also Executed for his Treason in the <HI>Northern</HI> Rebellion before mentioned. But I find, that altho' several Persons were ap∣prehended for offending against 13 <HI>Eliz</HI> 2. which was made against bringing in Bulls, <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI> &amp;c. as private Tokens of Papal Obedience, and against reconciling any to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet not one was Executed till 1577, which was almost twenty years after the Queen's Accession to the Crown.</P>
<P>The first that was convicted upon this Law, was one <HI>Cuthbert Mayne,</HI> a Priest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambd. <HI>An∣nals, f.</HI> 224, 225</NOTE> who being an obstinate Maintainer of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Power against his Princess, was put to Death at <HI>St. Stephens Fane,</HI> commonly called <HI>Launston</HI> in <HI>Cornwel,</HI> and one <HI>Trugion</HI> a Gentleman, that had harboured him, was turned out of his Estate, and condemned in perpetual Impri∣sonment; and after him <HI>Hanse</HI> and <HI>Nelson,</HI> and one <HI>Sherwood,</HI> all for maintaining that the Queen was a <HI>Schismatick</HI> and <HI>Heretick</HI> and ought to be Deposed, so that from the time of making 13 <HI>Eliz. ca.</HI> 2. in 1571, to this year of 1577, fair and calm weather shone upon the <HI>Papists</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who, by a merciful connivance, served God according to their own way of Worship, in their private Houses, in a manner without any Punishment, al∣tho' it were prohibited by the Law, by which a pecuniary Mulct was to be inflicted on them; neither did the Queen in all this time offer violence to their Consciences, nor was she easily to be induced to believe any thing amiss of the people, much less to inflict punishments upon them, for differing in Opinion; being wont to say, <HI>That she could be∣lieve nothing of her people, which Parents would not believe of their Children.</HI></P>
<P>And was not this Clemency and Kindness sufficient to prevail with the <HI>Papists,</HI> to leave off their <HI>Plots</HI> and <HI>Contrivances against her</HI> and the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI>? Were not these Laws severe enough to keep them within the bounds of their Duty? Will neither Love allure them to Obedience, nor threatnings upon so severe penalties, as the loss of Life and Estate, deter them from offending? one might reasonably have expected it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Steukly<HI>'s Plot.</HI> Cambd. <HI>Annals f.</HI> 230.</P><P>Baker<HI>'s Chron. f.</HI> 354.</P></NOTE> But instead there∣of in 1578, for Invading <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> both at once, and deposing of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> (who was the strongest Bulwark of the Reformed Religion) both the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> the thirteenth Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> entred into a Confederacy, at and by the instigation of one <HI>Thomas Steukly,</HI> a Fugitive, herein before mentioned, but that design by the Pro∣vidence of God being defeated,</P>
<P>In the year 1579, one <HI>James Fitz-Morris,</HI> a Fugitive, raised a Rebellion in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Fitz-Morris <HI>his Plot.</HI></P><P>Camb. <HI>Annals, f.</HI> 336.</P></NOTE> the same <HI>James,</HI> who had not long before been in a Rebellion, and was upon his sub∣mission (having most religiously vowed his Fidelity and Obedience to the Queen) par∣doned. He having (at the earnest solicitations of <HI>Saunders,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Priest, and <HI>Allen</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> one, both of them <HI>Doctors</HI> in <HI>Divinity</HI>) gotten a little Money of the <HI>Pope</HI>; the Authority of a <HI>Legate</HI> granted to <HI>Saunders</HI>; a <HI>consecrated Banner,</HI> and Letters of recom∣mendation to the <HI>Spaniard</HI>; went to <HI>Spain,</HI> and thence into <HI>Ireland</HI>; where he landed the first day of <HI>July,</HI> with those two <HI>Romish</HI> Priests, three Ships, and a small body of men, who were all soon disperst, and <HI>Fitz Morris</HI> slain.</P>
<P>There is one story, relating to this Rebellion, that for the <HI>Cruelty</HI> of it, I can't let pass: As soon as the Lord Deputy had certain intelligence of <HI>Fitz-Morris</HI> his being land∣ed, he commanded the Earl of <HI>Desmond,</HI> and his Brothers jointly, by <HI>Henry Davil</HI> an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Gentleman, and a stout Souldier, and very familiar with the <HI>Desmonds,</HI> that they should forthwith assault the Fort; which when they shifted off, as a thing full of Danger, <HI>Davil</HI> departed, in order to obey the Deputy's Commands, and <HI>John Desmond</HI> followed after him; at <HI>Trally,</HI> a small Town, he overtook him at his Inn, and in the dead of the night, having corrupted his Host, broke into his Chamber, with certain Cut-Throats, having their Swords drawn, where <HI>Davil</HI> slept securely, with <HI>Arthur Carter,</HI> Lieutenant to the <HI>Marshal</HI> of <HI>Munster,</HI> a stout old Soldier; but being awakened with the noise, when he saw <HI>John Desmond</HI> in the Chamber with his Sword drawn, he raised himself up, say∣ing, what's the matter my Son? (<HI>for so he was wont familiarly to call him.</HI>) I will no longer be thy Son, (says he) nor shalt thou be my Father, thou shalt dye; and therewithal they slew both him and <HI>Carter</HI> that lay with him, stabbing them in many places, after that <HI>Davil</HI>'s Lackey, by interposing his naked body, had done the best he could, for a while,
<PB N="32" REF="19"/>
to defend his Master, and had receiv'd some wounds; then he slew all <HI>Davil</HI>'s Servants, one after ano¦ther, who were lodged here and there in several Chambers, and so returning all begored with Blood, he boasted amongst the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the Murther: And <HI>let this</HI> (said he) <HI>be a pledge to you of my faithfulness to∣wards you, and the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>They were then ingaged in a Conspiracy for the Subversion of the Protestant Religion.</P><P><HI>Desmond</HI> car∣ries on the Re¦bellion.</P><P><HI>Camb.</HI> Annals, f. <HI>238, 239, 240.</HI></P><P><HI>Baker</HI>'s Chron. f. <HI>355.</HI></P></NOTE> Cause you are ingaged in.</HI> This Fact <HI>Sounders</HI> commended as a sweet Sacrifice in the sight of God.

<P>This Rebellion ended not with <HI>John Fitz-Morris</HI>; but was, after his death, carried on by <HI>John Desmond,</HI> and notwithstanding the Earl of <HI>Desmond</HI> had promised <HI>Drury,</HI> then Lord Deputy, his fidelity and obedience to the Queen, and bound himself by Oath, that both himself in person, and his would serve her against the Rebels, yet he afterwards pulled off his Vizzard, and openly went over to the Rebels, and the Lord De∣puty dying and the Council of <HI>Ireland</HI> having made <HI>Sir William Pelham</HI> Justicer of <HI>Ireland,</HI> he admonished the Earl of <HI>Desmond</HI>▪ and demanded the delivery up of <HI>Saunders,</HI> the Foreign Souldiers, and the Castles of <HI>Carigo Foyle</HI> and <HI>Asketten,</HI> but he refusing, was Proclaimed a Traytor, and guilty of High Treason, for having dealt with Foreign Princes for the Conquest and Destruction of his Native Country, reliev'd <HI>Saun∣ders</HI> and <HI>James Fitz-Morris</HI> Rebels, harboured the <HI>Spaniards</HI> which escaped out of the Fort at <HI>Smerwick</HI> hanged up divers faithful Subjects, displayed the Pope's Banner against the Queen, and brought Foreign∣ers into the Realm: And then the Lord Justicer committed the prosecution of the whole War to <HI>Ormond,</HI> which he prosecuted so vigorously, that this <HI>Desmond</HI> and his Brethren were forced to lurk and hide their heads▪ yet they added so much Popish Impudence to their former base Treachery and Perfidiousness, that they signified to the Lord Justicer in a long Letter▪ that they had undertaken the protection of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Faith (<HI>i. e.

<P>Out of these <HI>Seminaries,</HI> were sent forth into divers parts of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> at first, a few young men, and afterwards more, according as they grew up, who were entered over-hastily into holy Orders, and instructed in the above mentioned Principles. They pretended only to administer the Sacraments of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, and to preach to <HI>Papists</HI>; but the Queen and her Council soon found, that they were sent over, underhand, to seduce the Subjects from their Allegiance, and Obedience due to their Prince; to oblige them by reconciliation, to perform the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Command, to stir up intestine Rebellions, under the Seal of Confession, and flatly to execute the Sentence of <HI>Pius</HI> V. against the Queen; to the end, that Way might be made for the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who had designed the Conquest of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To these <HI>Seminaries,</HI> were sent daily out of <HI>England</HI> by the Papists, in contempt and dispight of the Laws, great numbers of Boys, and young Men of all sorts, and admitted into the same, making a Vow to return into <HI>England</HI>; Others also crept secretly from thence into the Land, and more were daily expect∣ed with the Jesuits, who at that time came first into <HI>England.</HI> This occasioned the Queen to issue out a Proclamation.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Camb.</HI> Annals, f. <HI>245.</HI></P><P>Collection, f. <HI>42.</HI></P></NOTE> <Q>That whosovever had any Children, Wards, Kinsmen, or other Relations, in the parts be∣yond the Seas, should after 10 days give in their Names to the Ordinary, and within four Months call them home again, and when they were returned, should forthwith give notice of the same to the said Ordinary.

<P>This <HI>Parsons</HI> was of <HI>Somerset-shire,</HI> a violent, fierce natur'd Man, and of rough be∣haviour, <HI>Campian</HI> was a <HI>Londoner,</HI> of a sweet disposition, and a well pollish'd Man, both of them were, by Education <HI>Oxford</HI> Men, and known there to <HI>Cambden</HI> himself, as he avers; <HI>Campian</HI> being of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Colledge, bare the Office of <HI>Proctor</HI> of the Uni∣versity, in the Year 1568. and being made <HI>Deacon,</HI> made a shew of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, he withdrew himself out of <HI>England, (they can turn themselves into all shapes, to carry on their Barbarous and Cruel Conspiracies against the</HI> Protestants, <HI>and the true Reli∣gion which they profess: Modern Instances of this we have not a few.) Parsons</HI> was of <HI>Balliol</HI> Colledge, wherein he openly professed the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, until he was for his loose carriage Expell'd with disgrace, and went over to the <HI>Papists, (and it hath been observed by many, and that very truly, that they who go over from the</HI> Protestant <HI>to the</HI> Popish <HI>Religion, are generally Men of very vitious and loose Lives:</HI>) These two coming privately into <HI>England,</HI> Travelled up and down the Country, and to <HI>Popish</HI> Gentlemens Houses, Covertly, and in the disguised Habits, sometimes of Souldiers, sometimes of Gentle∣men, sometimes of Ministers of the Word, and sometimes of Apparitors, diligently performing what they had in Charge, both in word and writing: <HI>Parsons</HI> who was Constituted Superior, being a Man of a Seditious and Turbulent Spirit, and Armed with a Confident Boldness, tampered so far with the <HI>Papists</HI> about deposing the Queen, that some of them (<HI>Cambden</HI> saith, he speaks upon their own Credit,) thought to have delivered them into the Magistrates hands; <HI>Campian</HI> the more modest, yet by a written Paper, Challenged the Ministers of the <HI>English</HI> Church to a Disputation, and published a Neat well-pen'd Book in Latine, called, <HI>Ten Reasons in Defence of the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> Rome: And <HI>Parsons</HI> put out another virulent Book in <HI>English</HI> against <HI>Clark,</HI> who had soberly written against <HI>Campian</HI>'s Challenge; but to <HI>Campian</HI>'s Reasons, <HI>Whitaker</HI> gave a solid Answer. <HI>Campian</HI> himself was taken a Year after, and put to the Rack, and afterwards being brought forth to Dispute, he scarcely answered the expectation raised of him.</P>
<P>Neither wanted there others also of the <HI>Popish</HI> Faction (<HI>for Religion was then grown into faction as it was very lately here in</HI> England) who Laboured Tooth and Nail at <HI>Rome,</HI> and elsewhere in Princes Courts, to raise War against their own Country: Yea, they published also in Print, that the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had Con∣spired together, to Conquer <HI>England</HI>; and expose it for a Spoil and Prey. And this they did on purpose to give Courage to their own Party, and to terrifie others from their Allegiance to their Prince and Country. This forced a <HI>Manifesto</HI> from the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camb. <HI>Annals,</HI> f. 247.</NOTE> wherein (after acknowledgment of the goodness of God towards her;) She declar∣eth, <HI>that she had attempted nothing against any Prince, but for preservation of her own King∣dom; nor had she Invaded the Provinces of any other, tho she had been sundry times thereunto both provoked by Injuries, and invited by Opportunities, that if any Prince go about to attempt ought against her, she doubts not but to be able (by the Blessing of God) to defend her People, and to that purpose she had Mustered her Forces, both by Sea, and Land, and had them now in readiness against any Hostile Invasion; her faithful Subjects she Exhorts, to continue immoveable in their Allegiance and Duty towards God and their Prince, the Minister of God,</HI> (not their absolute Supream Lord, to dispose of them and theirs according to will and pleasure,)

<HI>the rest who had shaken off their Love to their Country, and their Obedience to their Prince, she commands to carry themselves modestly and peaceably, and not provoke the severity of Justice a∣gainst themselves, for she would no longer be so imprudent, as by sparing the Bad, to prove cruel to her self and her good Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>By this <HI>Manifesto</HI> all Men may see how tender and compassionate the Queen was to her worst Subjects, even them who had renounced their Allegiance to her, and very hardly was she brought to put the Laws in Execution against them, although they so justly deserved it, of which take the following account from Mr. <HI>Cambden.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Camb. <HI>Annals f.</HI> 270.</NOTE>The Queen, to take away the fear which had possest many Minds, that Religion would be altered, and Popery tollerated, being overcome by importunate Intreaties, permitted, (<HI>not furiously Commanded, as if she thirsted after Blood</HI>) That <HI>Edmund Campian</HI> aforesaid, of the Society of <HI>Jesus, Ralph Sherwin, Luke Kirby</HI> and <HI>Alexander Briant,</HI> Priests, should be Arraigned; who being Indicted upon the Act for Treason made 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. and charged to have compassed and imagined the destruction of the Queen and Realm, to have adhered to the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Queens Enemy, to have come into <HI>England</HI> to disturb the Peace and Quiet of the Realm, and to have raised forces to that end, were condemned to dye; and persisting obstinately to defend the <HI>Popes</HI> Authority against the Queen, were Executed; <HI>And not for professing the Popish Religion, or exercising it barely, as some of the Romanists and a few ignorant Protestants pretend</HI>: For <HI>Campian,</HI> after he was condemned, being askt first, whether Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> were a true and lawful Queen? refused to answer, then whether he would take part with the Queen, or the <HI>Pope</HI> if he should send Forces against the Queen? he openly professed, and testified under his hand, that he would stand for the <HI>Pope.</HI> Afterwards some others also were Exe∣cuted for the same Reasons, whereas in full ten Years time after the Northern Rebel∣lion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But five Pa∣pists put to death in ten Years.</NOTE> there had been no more then five Papists put to death.</P>
<P>But such now were the times, that the Queen (<HI>who never was of opinion that Mens Consciences were to be forced</HI>) complained many times, that she was driven of necessity, to take these Courses, unless she would suffer the ruin of her self and her Subjects, upon some Mens pretence of Conscience and the Catholic Religion (<HI>i. e. the Abby Lands and a Cardinals Cap</HI>) yet for the greater part of these silly Priests, she did not at all believe them guilty of Plotting the destruction of their Country; but their <HI>Superiors</HI> were they, she held,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Camb.</HI> Annals f. <HI>271.</HI></P><P>Lord <HI>Burleigh</HI> saith the same thing, Collecti∣on. f. <HI>28.</HI></P></NOTE> to be the Instruments of this villany; for these inferior <HI>Emissaries</HI> committed the full and free disposure of themselves, to their, Superiors: And when those of the Superiors that were then and afterwards taken, were asked, whether by the Authority of the Bull of <HI>Pius</HI> V. Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Subjects were so absolved from their Oath of Allegiance towards the Queen, that they might take up Arms against her? whether they thought her to be a lawful Queen? whether they would subscribe to <HI>Saunders</HI> and <HI>Bristow's</HI> opinion, concerning the Authority of that Bull? whether, if the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> should wage War against the Queen, they would joyn with her or him? they answered, some of them so ambiguously, some so resolutely, and some by prevarication or silence shifted off the matter, in such a manner, that divers ingenious <HI>Papists (which are rare to find in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Age)</HI> began to suspect they fostered some treacherous disloyalty; and <HI>John Bishop,</HI> a Man otherwise devoted to the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> wrote against them, and solidly proved, that that Constitution obtruded under the Name of the <HI>Lateran</HI> Council, upon which the whole Authority of absolving Subjects from their Allegiance, and deposing Princes is founded, is no other, then a Decree of <HI>Innocent</HI> the <HI>III.</HI> and was never ad∣mitted in <HI>England</HI>; yea that the said Council was no Council at all, nor was it at all there decreed by the Fathers.

void; and to be esteemed as of no validity; and some of them were not ashamed to own, that they were returned into <HI>England</HI> with no other intent, then by reconciling Men at Confession, to absolve every one particularly from all his Oaths of <HI>Allegiance</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> to the Queen, just as the said Bull did absolve them all at once, and in general. And this seemed the easier to be effected, because they promised withal absolution, from all Mortal sins; and the safer, because it was pronounced more close∣ly, and under the Seal of Confession.</P>

<P><HI>That our most Gracious Queen, did at her first Entry loosen us from the Yoke of</HI> Rome, <HI>and did Restore unto this Realm the most pure and holy Religion of the Gospel, which for a time was overshaddowed with Popery, is known of all the World, and felt of us to our singular Com∣fort. But from hence as from the Root, hath sprung that implacable Malice of the Pope, and his Confederates against her, whereby they have and do not seek only to trouble, but if they could, to bring the Realm again into a Thraldom; the rather for that, they hold this as a firm and setled opinion, that</HI> England <HI>is the only setled Monarchy that most doth maintain and counte∣nance Religion, being the chief Sanctuary for the afflicted Members of the Church, that fly thither from the Tyranny of</HI> Rome, <HI>as Men being in danger of Shipwrack, do from a raging and tempestuous Sea to a calm and quiet Haven. This being so, what hath not the Pope assay∣ed to annoy the Queen and her State, thereby as he thinketh to remove this great obstacle, that standeth between him and the overflowing of the World again Popery, for the proof whereof these may suffice.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The Pope turned thus the Venom of his Curses, the Pens of his malitious Parasites into Men of War and Weapons, to win that by force, which otherwise he could not do. And though all these are said to be done by the Pope, and in his Name; yet who seeth not, that they be main∣tained under hand by some Princes his Confederates? And if any Man be in doubt of that, let him but note from whence the last Invasion into</HI> Ireland <HI>came, of what Country the Ships, and of what Nation the most part of the Souldiers were, and by direction of whose Ministers they received their Victuals and Furniture.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the Pope of himself at this present is far unable to make War upon any Prince of that Estate which Her Majesty is of; having lost as you know many years by the Preaching of the Gospel, those infinite Revenues, which he was wont to have out of</HI> England, Scotland, Ger∣many, Switzerland, Denmark <HI>and others, and now out of</HI> France <HI>and the</HI> Low Countries, <HI>so as we are to think that his Name only is used, and all or the most part of the Charge born by others.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Queen nevertheless, by the Almighty Power of God, standeth fast, maugre the Pope and all his Friends; having hitherto resisted all Attempts against her, to her great Honour and their Shame, as the Rebellion in the North suppressed without Effusion of Blood, wherein her Majesty may say as Caesar did,</HI> Veni, Vidi, Vici, <HI>as expedite and as honourable was the Victory that God did give her, by the Diligence and Valour of those Noble Men that had the conducting thereof.

<P><HI>Neither these nor any other Threatnings or Fears of Danger, hath or doth make her to stagger or relent in the Cause of Religion, but like a constant Christian Princess, she still holdeth fast the Profession of the Gospel, that hath so long upholden her, and made us to live in Peace, twenty two years and more under her most gracious Government, free from those Troubles that our Neighbours have felt; so as this now seemeth to be our present State, a Blessed, Peaceable, and happy Time, for the which we are most bound to God, and to pray unto him for the con∣tinuance thereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But yet notwithstanding, seeing our Enemies sleep not, it behoveth us not to be careless, as tho all were past, but rather to think that there is but a piece of the Storm over, and that the greater part of the Tempest remaineth behind, and is like to fall upon us, by the Malice of the Pope, the most capital Enemy of the Queen and of this State, the Determinations of the Councils of</HI> Trent, <HI>and the Combinations of the Pope with other Monarchies and Princes devoted unto</HI> Rome, <HI>assuring our selves, That if their Powers be answerable to their Wills, this Realm shall find at their Hands, all the Miseries and Extremities that they can bring upon it. And though by the late good Success, which God hath given in</HI> Ireland, <HI>these leud and malicious Enterprises seem for a time to be as it were at a stand; yet let us be assured, that neither their Attempts up∣on</HI> Ireland, <HI>neither the Mischief intended against</HI> England, <HI>will cease thus; but if they find us negligent, they will be ready with greater Forces then have been yet seen. The certain De∣termination which the Pope and his combined Friends have to root out the Religion of the Gospel in all Places, and to begin here as their greatest Impediment, is Cause sufficient to make us the more vigilant, and to have a wary Eye to their Doings and Proceedings, how smoothly soever they speak or dissemble their Friendships for the time, for let us think surely, that they have joyned Hands together against us, and if they can, they will procure the Sparks of the Flames that have been so terrible in other Countries, to fly over into</HI> England, <HI>and to kindle as great a Fire here. And as the Pope by open Hostility, as you see, hath shewed himself against her Majesty, so the better to answer in time the Purposes that he hath set down in the mean Season, till they may come to Ripeness, he hath and doth by secret Practices within the Realm, leaving nothing unprovided, emboldning many undutiful Subjects to stand fast in their Disobedience to her Majesty and her Laws. For albeit, the pure Religion of the Gospel hath had a free Course, and hath been freely preached now many Years within this Realm, by the Protection of Her Majesties most Christian Government; yet such have been the Practices of the Pope and his secret Ministers, as the obsti∣nate and stiff-necked Papist is so far from being reformed, as he hath gotten Stomach to go back∣ward, and to shew his Disobedience, not only in arrogant Words, but also in contemptuous Deeds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To confirm them herein, and to increase their Number, you see how the Pope hath and doth comfort their hollow, Hearts with Absolutions, Dispensations, Reconciliations, and such other things of</HI> Rome. <HI>You see how lately he hath sent hither a sort of Hypocrites, naming them∣selves Jesuits, a Rabble of Vagrant Fryars, newly sprung up, and running through the World, to trouble the Church of God; whose principal Errand, is by creeping into the Houses of Men of Behaviour and Reputation, not only to corrupt the Realm with false Doctrine, but also under that Pretence, to stir up Sedition, to the Peril of Her Majesty and her good Subjects. How these Practises of the Pope have wrought in the disobedient Subjects of this Land, is both evident and lamentable to consider; for such Impressions hath the Estimation of the Popes Authority made in them, as not only those, which from the Beginning have refused to obey, but many, yea, very many of these, who divers years together, did yield and conform themselves in their open Accounts, since the Decrees of that unholy Council of</HI> Trent, <HI>and since the publishing and de∣nouncing of that Blasphemous Bull against Her Majesty, and since those secret Absolutions and Reconciliations, and the swarming hither of a number of Popish Priests, and Monkish Jesuits, have, and do utterly refuse to be of our Church, or to resort unto our Preaching and Prayers. The sequel whereof must needs prove dangerous to the whole State of the Common-wealth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By this you see what Cause we have justly to doubt great Mischief threatned to this Realm, and therewith you may easily see also, how far the preventing and withstanding of the same, it behooveth her Majesty, not only to provide in time, sufficient Laws for the continuing of this Peaceable Government, but also to be ready with Forces to repress all Attempts that may be en∣terprised, either by Enemies abroad, or by evil Subjects at home.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What Difference there is between the Popes Persecuting Church, and this</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Church of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mild Church of the Gospel, hath been seen in all Ages, and especially in the late Government, compared with the merciful time of Her Majesties Reign. The Continuance of which Clemency, is also to be wish∣ed, so far as may stand with Gods Honour, and the Safety of the Realm. But when by long

proof, we find that this favorable and gentle Manner of Dealing with the Disobeyers and Con∣temners of Religion, to win them by fair Means, if it were possible, hath done no good, but hath bred in them a more arrogant and contemptuous Spirit, so as they have not only presumed to disobey the Laws and Orders of the Realm, but also to accept from</HI> Rome <HI>secret Absolutions, Reconciliations and such like; and that by the Hands of leud Runnagates, Priests and Jesuits, har∣bouring and entertaining them even in their Houses, thereby shewing an Obedience to the Pope, by their Directions; also nourishing and training up their Children and Kinsfolks, not only at home, but also abroad in the Seminaries of Popery; Now, I say, it is time for us to look more narrowly and strictly to them, least as they be corrupt, so they prove dangerous Members to many born within the Entrails of our Common-wealth.</HI></P>
<P>And seeing that the Lenity of the Time, and the Mildness of the Laws heretofore made, are no small Cause of their arrogant Disobedience, 'tis necessary that we make a Provision of Laws, more strict, and more severe, to constrain them to yield their open Obedience, at the least, to her Majesty, in Causes of Religion, and not to live as they lift, to the perillous Example of o∣thers, and to the encouraging of their own evil affected Minds; but if they will needs submit themselves to the Benedictions of the Pope, they may feel how little his Curses can hurt us, and how little his Blessings can save them from that Punishment, which we are able to lay upon them; letting them also find, how dangerous it shall be for them to deal with the Pope, or any thing of his, or with those Romish Priests and Jesuits; and therewith, also how perillous it shall be for those Seditious Runnagates to enter into the Land, to draw away from Her Majesty that Obedience, which by the Laws of God and Man, are due unto her.</P>
<P>This then is one of the Provisions which we ought to take care of in this Council, whereby we may both enjoy still that happy Peace we live in, and the Pope take the less Boldness to trouble us, by any Favour he shall find here.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore, seeing the Malice of the Pope and his Confederates are so notorious unto us, and seeing the Dangers be so great, so evident, and so imminent, and seeing that Preparations to withstand them, cannot be made without support of the Realm, and seeing that our Duty to God, our Queen and Country, and the Necessity that hangeth upon our own Safeguards, be rea∣son sufficient to perswade us; let us think upon these Matters as the Weight of them deserveth, and so provide in time, both by Laws to restrain and correct the evil affected Subjects, and by Provision of that which shall be requisite for the Maintainance of Forces, as our Enemies finding our Minds so willing, and our Hands so ready, to keep in order our Country, and to furnish her Majesty with all that shall be necessary, may either be discouraged to attempt any thing against us, or if they do, they may find such Resistance, as shall bring Confusion to themselves, Honour to our most Gracious Queen, and Safety to all of us.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> seconding the Motion, it was referred to a Committee to prepare Bills.</P>
<P>And that Session there was an Act of Parliament made, that is intituled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 <HI>Eliz.</HI> ca. 1. Rast. Stat. 2. <HI>part f.</HI> 243.</NOTE> <HI>An Act to retain the Queens Majesties Subjects in their due Obedience</HI>; which Act recites, <HI>That, where since the making of the</HI> 13th. <HI>of the Queen,</HI> Ca. 2. <HI>divers evil affected Persons have promised, contrary to the meaning of the said Statutes, by other means then by Bulls, or Instruments written or printed, to withdraw divers the Queens Majesties Subjects from their natural Obedience to Her Majesty, and to obey the usurped Authority of</HI> Rome, <HI>and in respect of the same, to perswade great Numbers to withdraw their due Obedience to Her Majesties Laws, established for the due Service of Almighty God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is thereby enacted, that they should be guilty of High Treason,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treason in Re∣conciler and Reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> <HI>who should diswade the Subjects from their Obedience to their Prince, and from the Religion established in</HI> England, <HI>or should reconcile them to the Church of</HI> Rome; <HI>as also those who should be diswaded or reconciled; those also who should say Mass, were to be fined</HI> 200 <HI>Marks, and to suffer Imprisonment for a Year, or longer, if they paid not the Money; they who should be wittingly and willingly present at Mass, were to be fined</HI> 100 <HI>Marks, and to suffer Imprisonment likewise for a Year; and they who refused to frequent Divine Service, are to forfeit</HI> 20 <HI>Pounds a Month: but there must in every Case a legal Conviction precede.</HI></P>
<P>From the History of the <HI>Papists</HI> Conspiracies, and the Queens Carriage towards them, during these last ten Years, whereof I have given an Account, I cannot but observe.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="38" REF="22"/>1. That the <HI>Papists</HI> are a most perverse and disingenuous Generation of Men, who never have lived, (<HI>nor is it to be believed ever will</HI>) in Obedience to any Prince who is not of their own Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That, notwithstanding their many Treasons and Rebellions in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> against Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> yet, in ten years time, there were not above five exe∣cuted upon any of the Penal Laws made against them; and that she was hardly pre∣vailed upon to execute any of them, although for the most apparent Treason; and would not have yielded, but that it appeared necessary, for the Preservation of her self, her Protestant Subjects, and the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. That therefore the Penal Laws were not made so much with design to offend the <HI>Papists,</HI> as to defend the Queen and her Government from the Treasons, Rebelli∣ons, Outrages and Violences every where committed by the <HI>Papists,</HI> stirred up and egged on by the <HI>Seminary Priests, Jesuits,</HI> and sent hither for that very Purpose.</P>
<P N="4">4. That notwithstanding all their Plots and Contrivances, there was no restraint up∣on their exercising their Religion in their own private Families; nor no Prohibitions of saying or hearing Mass, till this last Act of Parliament was made; which was ex∣torted from the State by their horrid Abuse of their former Liberty.</P>
<P>So that he that denies the Reasonableness of those Penal Laws against <HI>Papists,</HI> must (one would think) offer Violence to his own Reason.</P>
<P>But yet least the <HI>Papists</HI> should object, and any <HI>weak Protestant</HI> think, with too great <HI>Colour</HI> of Reason, that these Facts are the Relation of <HI>Protestant Historians,</HI> who will be sure to write all things with the greatest plausibleness and shew of Reason and Justice on their own side, and will be sure to blacken and villifie the <HI>Papists</HI> as much as they are able, although they have never so little reason so to do.</P>
<P>I shall, to back what I have related from our own <HI>Historians,</HI> and to convince all mankind that it is true, subjoyn what the <HI>Seeular Priests</HI> themselves, in their important Considerations have owned, was the true ground and reason of making this Act of Parliament, of 23 <HI>Eliz. Cap.</HI> 1. and because the <HI>Papists</HI> shall not say I bely, mis-con∣strue or misrepresent them, take it in their own Words.</P>

(abused still by false Pretences) did set forward that Course, and sending thither certain Forces, Mr. <HI>Saunders</HI> (too much Jesuited) did thrust himself in Person into that Action, as a chief Ring-leader, and to perswade the Catholics, when he should come into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to joyn with the Popes said For∣ces, for the better assisting certain Rebels, then in Arms against their Soveraign. Now whilst these Practises were in hand in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen Ex∣communicated by <HI>Gregory 13th.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Gregory</HI> the Thirteenth reneweth the said Bull of <HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> and denounceth her Majesty to be excommunicated, with Intimations of all other particulars in the former Bull mentioned, which was procured (we doubt not) by Surreptions, the false Jesuits (our Country-men) daring to at∣tempt any thing, by untrue Suggestions, and any leud Surmises that may serve their turns. This Stratagem accomplisht, and ground laid, whereupon they imagined to work great Matters: these good Fathers (as the Devil would have it) came into <HI>England,</HI> and intruded themselves into our Harvest, being the Men in our Consciences (we mean both them and others of that Society, with some of their Adherents) who have been the chief Instruments of all the Mischiefs that have been intended against her Majesty, since the beginning of her Reign, and of the Miseries which we, or any other Catholics, have upon these Occasions sustained. Their first repair hither, was <HI>Anno</HI> 1580. when the Realm of <HI>Ireland</HI> was in great Combustion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parsons <HI>and</HI> Campians <HI>coming into</HI> England <HI>in</HI> 1580.</NOTE> and then they entred (<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Campian</HI> the Subject, and Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI> the Provincial) like a Tempest, with sundry such great Brags and Challenges, as divers of the gravest Clergy then living in <HI>England</HI> (Dr. <HI>Watson,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and others) did greatly dislike
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>
them, and plainly foretold, that (as things then stood) their Proceedings after that fashion, would certainly urge the State to make some sharp Laws, which should not only touch them, but likewise all others, both Priests and Catholics, upon their Arrival; and after these brags, Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI> presently fell to his Jesuitical Courses; and so be-laboured both himself and others in matters of State, how he might set her Majesties Crown upon another Head (as appeareth by a letter of his own to a certain Earl,) that the Catholics themselves threatned to deliver him into the hands of the Civil Magistrate, except he desisted from such kind of practices.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In these tumultuous and rebellious proceedings by sundry Catholics, both in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> it could not be expected, but that the Queen and the State would be greatly incensed with indignation against us. We had (some of us) greatly ap∣proved the said Rebellion, highly extoll'd the Rebels, and pitifully bewailed their Ruin and Over-throw. Many of our affections were knit to the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; and for our Obedience to the <HI>Pope,</HI> we all do profess it. The attempts both of the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Spaniard</HI> failing in <HI>England</HI>; his Holiness as a temporal Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Popes Ban∣ner displayed in <HI>Ireland</HI> to de∣pose the Queen.</NOTE> displayed his Banner in <HI>Ireland.</HI> This Plot was to deprive Her Highness first from that Kingdom (if they could) and then by degrees to depose her from this. In all these Plots, none were more forward then many of us that were Priests: The Layity, if we had opposed our selves to these designments, would out of doubt) have been over-ruled by us. How many of our Calling were addicted to these Courses the State knew not. In which Case (the premises discreetly considered) there is no King, or Prince in the World, disgusting the See of <HI>Rome</HI>; and having either force or Metal in him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen Vindicated and commended.</NOTE> that would have indured us, if possible he could have been revenged, but rather (as we think) have utterly rooted us out of his Territories, as Traytors, and Rebels both to him and his Country. And therefore we may rejoyce unfeignedly, that God hath blessed this Kingdom with so gracious and merciful a Soveraign, who hath not dealt, in this sort with us. Assuredly if she were a Catholic, she might be accounted the Mirrour of the World; but as she is, both we and all other Catholics, her natural Subjects, deserve no longer to live, then we hereafter shall Honour her from our Hearts, obey her in all things (so far as possibly we may) pray for her Prosperous Reign and long Life, and to our Powers, defend and Protect, both her and our Country against any whatsoever, that shall by force of Arms attempt to damnifie either of them; for in the said Garboils, and very undutiful Proceedings; how hath her Highness dealt with us? From the time of the said Rebellion and Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papists themselves con∣fess not above twelve Execu∣ted in ten years.</NOTE> there were few above twelve, that in ten Years, had been Executed for their Consciences (as we hold) al∣tho our Adversaries say for Treason, and of those twelve, some parhaps can hardly be drawn within our Account, having been tainted with matters of Rebellion. The most of the said number were Seminary Priests, who if they had come over with the like intents, that some others have done, might very worthily have been used as they were: But in our Consciences; nay, some of us do know it, that they were far from those Seditious humours; being Men that intended nothing else then simply the good of our Country; and the Conversion of Souls. Marry, to say the Truth, as we have Confessed before, how could either her Majesty or the State, know so much.</Q> They had great Cause, as politic Persons, to suspect the worst.</P>
<P><Q>Besides to the further Honour of Her Majesty we may not Omit, that the States of the whole Realm Assembled in Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> 1576. Were pleased to pass us over, and made no Laws at that time against us: The Antient Prisoners that had been restrained more narrowly in the Year 1570. were (notwithstanding the said Enter∣prizes in <HI>Ireland</HI>) again restored to their former Liberty, to continue with their Friends as they had done before; such as were not suspected to have been Dealers or Abet∣tors, in the said Treasonable Accounts, were used with that humanity, which could not well be expected. But when the <HI>Jesuits</HI> were come, and that the State had notice of the said Excommunication, there was then within a while great alteration; for such were the <HI>Jesuits</HI> proceedings, and with so great boldness, as tho all had been theirs, and that the State should presently have been changed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Her Majesty had seen what followed in her Kingdom upon the first Excommuni∣cation, and was therefore in all worldly Policy to prevent the like by the second. The Jealousie also of the State was much increased by Mr. <HI>Sherwin's</HI> answer upon his Ex∣amination,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jesuits in∣direct answe∣ring of plain Questions.</NOTE> above Eight Months before the Apprehension of Mr. <HI>Campian</HI>: For being asked, whether the Queen was his lawful Soveraign, notwithstanding any Sentence of the <HI>Popes</HI>? he prayed that no such Question might be demanded of him,
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>
and would not further thereunto Answer. Two or three other Questions much to the like effect, were likewise propounded unto him, which he also refused to Answer. Matters now <HI>sorting</HI> on this fashion, there was a greater restraint of <HI>Catholics,</HI> then at any time before, many both Priests and Gentlemen were sent into the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> and other places, there to be more safely kept and looked unto.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Proclamation upon the com∣ing over of the Jesuits &amp; Se∣minary Priests. This is a Mi∣stake, for the Law made by this Parliament was <HI>23. Eliz.

(according to the general Computation) a Procla∣mation was made for the Calling home of Her Majesties Subjects beyond the Seas, (such especially as were trained up in the Seminaries) pretending that they Learned little there, but disloyalty; and that none after that time should harbour or relieve them, with sundry other Points of hard intendment toward us. The same Month also a Parliament ensued; wherein a Law was made agreeable in effect to the said Proclamation: But with a more severe punishment annexed, for it was a Penalty of Death, for any Jesuit or Seminary Priest to repair into <HI>England,</HI> and for any to receive or entertain them, which fell out according to Bishop <HI>Watsons</HI> for∣mer Speeches or prediction, what mischiefs the <HI>Jesuits</HI> would bring upon us▪ We could here as well as some others have done, shew our dislike with some bitter∣ness of the said Law and Penalty. But to what purpose should we do so? It had been a good Point of Wisdom in two of three Persons, that have taken that course to have been silent, and rather to have thought by gentleness and sweet Carriage of themselves, to have prevented the more sharp Execution of that Law; then by ex∣claiming against it, when it was too late; to have provoked the State to a greater se∣verity against us. And to confess something to our disadvantage, and to excuse the said Parliament. If all the Seminary Priests then in <HI>England,</HI> or which should after that tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have come hither, had been of Mr. <HI>Morton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Saunders</HI> his mind be∣fore mentioned (when the first Excommunication came out) or of Mr. <HI>Saunders</HI> his second resolution (being then in Arms against Her Majesty in <HI>Ireland</HI>) or of Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI>▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parliament excused.</NOTE> Traiterous disposition both to our Queen and Country: The said Laws (no doubt) had carried with them a far greater shew of Justice. But that was the Error of the State; and yet not altogether (for ought they knew) improbable, those times being so full of many dangerous designments and Jesuitical practices.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In this Year, also divers other things fell out unhappily towards us poor Priests, and other the graver sort of Catholics, who had all of us single Hearts, and disliked (no man more) all such factious enterprizes: For notwithstanding the said Proclamation and Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heywoods <HI>Practices.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Heywood</HI> a Jesuit came then into <HI>England,</HI> and took so much upon him, that Father <HI>Parsons</HI> fell out exceedingly with him, and a great trouble grew amongst Catho∣lics, by their Brablings and Quarrels. A Synod was held by him the said Mr. <HI>Heywood,</HI> and sundry Ancient Customs were therein Abrogated, to the offence of ve∣ry many.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Campian</HI> an∣swered as <HI>Sherwin</HI> did.</NOTE> These Courses being understood (after a sort) by the State; the Catholics and Priests in <HI>Norfolk</HI> felt the smart of it. This Summer, also in <HI>July,</HI> Mr. <HI>Campian</HI> and other Priests were apprehended, whose Answers upon their Examinations, agreeing in effect with Mr. <HI>Sherwins</HI> before mentioned, did greatly incense the State, for, amongst other Questions that were propounded unto them, this being one, <HI>viz.</HI> if the <HI>Pope</HI> do by his <HI>Bull,</HI> or Sentence pronounce, Her Majesty to be deprived, and no Law∣ful Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Question propounded to <HI>Campian</HI> and others.</NOTE> and her Subjects to be discharged of their Allegiance and Obedience unto Her; and after the <HI>Pope</HI> or any other by his Appointment and Authority do Invade this Realm, which part would you take, or which part ought a good Subject of <HI>England</HI> to take? some Answered, that when the Case should happen, they would then take Councel, what were best for them to do: Another, that when that Case should happen, he would Answer and not before: Another, that for the present he was not resolved, what to do in such a Case: Another, that when the Case happen∣eth, then he will Answer: Another, that if such deprivation and Invasion should be made, for any Matter of his Faith, he thinketh he were then bound, to take part with the <HI>Pope.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Now, what King in the World, being in doubt to be invaded by his Enemies, and fearing that some of his own Subjects were by indirect means drawn, rather to adhere to them then to himself, would not make the best Tryal of them he could for his better satisfaction, whom he might trust to? In which Tryal, if he found any, that either should make doubtful Answers, or peremptorily affirm, that (as the Case stood betwixt him and his Enemies) they would leave him their Prince and take part with them; might he not justly repute them for Traitors, and deal with them accordingly; sure we are, that no King or Prince in Christendom, would like or tolerate any such Subjects within their Dominions, if possibly they could be rid of them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="23"/>Thus much the secular Priests themselves Confess; and certainly then, 'tis not to be denied, but they own all the Treasons and Villanies that the Protestants charge upon the Papists, only they would fain excuse themselves, and the grave sort of <HI>Catholicks</HI> from having any hand in them; And at the same time, they justifie the State in their pro∣cedure against them; because they have a Colour of reason to believe them all alike, and know not but they are so.</P>
<P>But may the <HI>Papists</HI> say, tho the States might have reason, to make it a Capital offence, to reconcile any of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet it seems hard, to make a Man a Traitor, for staying in, or if a Man be out, returning to his Native Countrey; which 27<HI>th Eliz. cap.</HI> 2. doth, which Objections will be suffici∣ciently answered, by the following Account of their Practices in the Queens Domini∣ons, from the twenty third year of her Reign to the twenty seventh.</P>

<P>One <HI>Edward Arden, Somervil's</HI> Wives Father, his own Wife, <HI>Somervil's</HI> Wife, and one <HI>Hall</HI> a Priest, were Arraigned, and Condemned for this Conspiracy. <HI>Somer∣vil</HI> was three days after found strangled in Prison; <HI>Arden</HI> was hanged and Quartered: But so merciful was the Queen, that she spared the Women, and the Priest. This unfortunate Gentleman <HI>Somervil</HI> was drawn into all this, by the cunning of a Priest, and cast by his Evidence, saith Mr. <HI>Cambden.</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>Parry</HI> had been pardoned formerly by the Queen of a Burglary and Assault, for which he was Tryed and Condemned, and to requite her, enters into a Conspiracy to take away her Life; which he being resolved to do, and being then beyond Seas, comes forthwith for <HI>London,</HI> and the better to get access to the Queen, and credit with her, resolves to discover, how he had been perswaded to kill her, which he doth at <HI>White-Hall</HI> as cunningly as he can. The Queen gave him the hearing, and began to put some confidence in him; He afterwards engageth the said Mr. <HI>Nevel</HI> in the design, who declared himself convinced of the lawfulness and braveness of the Action; so they both swear, in <HI>Parry's</HI> Lodgings, Secrecy, to kill her; yet all this while, <HI>Parry</HI> carried it so fair with the Queen, that She not only thought him a trusty Loyal Subject, but intended him a liberal Pension or Allowance.</P>

<P><PB N="43" REF="24"/>The Secretary entertains him kindly, telling him that the Queen had appointed him to deal with him, in a Matter that highly concerned her Majesty, knowing him to be one, who bore an extraordinary devotion to her; the Matter was, the Queen had been advertized, that there was some Plot in hand against her own Person, where∣with she thought, he could not but be made acquainted; considering the great trust that some of her greatest Enemies reposed in him: of this, she desired to understand his knowledge, and whether he himself might not at some time, or other have let slip some suspitious words, not with any real design against her, but to discover the intentions of others.</P>
<P><HI>Parry</HI> (strongly confiding in <HI>Nevil</HI>) earnestly denied it again and again, with several Protestations, that he was neither party nor privy to any such motion or enterprize, <HI>Walsingham</HI> dealt fairly with him, telling him that there was a Gentleman, and his friend, who would prove the contrary to his Face; yet <HI>Parry</HI> denieth all (<HI>true Popish impudence</HI>) though probably had he confest (<HI>and these were hints enough</HI>) and, accused <HI>Ne∣vil,</HI> at his first asking, he might have saved himself; and in this his great cunning was overseen.</P>
<P><HI>Parry</HI> thus obstinate in his denials, is not, permitted to go home, but lodged that Night at Mr. Secretry <HI>Walsinghams</HI> House in <HI>London</HI>: This put him in a peck of troubles, fills his Head full of suspitions; and having consulted with, his Pillow, the next Morn∣ing he desired to speak with Mr. Secretary, which granted, he confesseth that now he called to remembrance, that he once had Speech with one <HI>Nevil,</HI> concerning a Point of Doctrine, contained in one of Dr. <HI>Allen's</HI> Books; wherein it was maintained that it was lawful to take away the Life of a Prince, to benefit the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, but denied that he spake any thing of the Queen.</P>
<P>That Night he was Examined in <HI>Leicesters</HI> House before several, but still he deny'd all; whereupon <HI>Nevel</HI> was brought before him, who punctually justified every circum∣stance before his Face, yet the other, as formerly, denied all; however he is sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> where perceiving the exactness of the Proof against him, he freely and of his own accord, confessed all, which Confession take as the same is related by <HI>Cambden</HI> in these words.</P>
<P><Q>In the Year (saith he) 1570.

At <HI>Paris</HI> I was reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> at <HI>Venice</HI> I had conference with <HI>Benedict Palmio,</HI> a Jesuit, concerning the de∣stressed Catholics in <HI>England</HI>; and I gave him some hints that I had found out a way to relieve them, if the Pope or any Learned Divines would justifie it to be lawful; <HI>Palmio</HI> extolled this as a Pious design, and me he recommended to the Popes Nuncio at <HI>Venice,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Campeius</HI>; and <HI>Campeius</HI> recommended me to the Pope: I besought by Letters, that I might come to <HI>Rome,</HI> with a safe Conduct; Letters of safe Conduct were sent me from the Cardinal of <HI>Como,</HI> but not large enough, afterwards others were sent me more large and full, but then was I returned to <HI>Paris,</HI> there I lighted upon <HI>Morgan,</HI> who told me that it was expected by divers, that I should do some no∣table Service for God and the Catholic Church; I answered, that I was ready to kill the greatest Subject in <HI>England</HI>; but (said he) why not the Queen her self; and this said I, might easily be done, if it might appear to be lawful, for <HI>Watts</HI> a Priest with whom I had conference about it, (concealing persons Names) affirmed flatly, it was not lawful (and <HI>Chreighton</HI> also, a Scotish Jesuit, avouched the same, Teaching, that evil was not to be done that good might come of it; that God was better pleased with Adverbs then Nouns, and approved what was well done and lawfully, then what was otherwise good; and that many Souls were not to be redeemed with the destruction of any one, without the Express command of God) notwithstanding I having engaged my self, both by Letters and Promises, whilst I was in <HI>Italy,</HI> thought it an heinious sin to give over my enterprize, in case the Pope should approve it by his Letters, and grant me a plenary Pardon; which I begged of him, by Letters
<PB N="44" REF="25"/>
I sent to him by <HI>Ragozonio,</HI> his Nuncio in <HI>France</HI>; who highly commended my de∣sign, and sent my Letters to <HI>Rome,</HI> being returned into <HI>England,</HI> I procured access to the Queen, to whom after all By-standers were removed, I discovered the whole Conspiracy, how be it, cloaked with the best Art I could, she heard me without be∣ing daunted, I departed not without being terrified; and cannot now forget what she then said; That no Catholic should be called in Question meerly for Religion, or the Popes Supremacy, so that they shewed themselves good Subjects: In the mean time, whilst I was a daily Suitor in the Court, for the Mastership of St. <HI>Catharines,</HI> I received Letters from the Cardinal of <HI>Como,</HI> wherein my enterprize was commended, and my self absolved in the Popes Name. These Letters I imparted to the Queen, what effect they wrought with her I know not; to me they certainly added Courage, and took away all scruples; yet was I not minded to offer her any violence, if she could by any means be perswaded to deal more favourably with the Catholics. And therefore least I should commit the Murther, I layed away my Dagger still, as often as I had access to her; when I seriously considered her, and her truly Royal vertues, I was distracted with doubtful thoughts, for my Vows were recorded in Heaven, my Letters and Promises amongst Men; these things I often pondered with an un∣quiet Mind, I was never much beholden to her for any thing; my Life indeed she once Pardoned me; but to have taken it away upon that occasion, had been cruel and tyrannical; hereupon, I departed from Court much unsatisfied with my condi∣tion: I lighted upon Dr. <HI>Allens</HI> Book against the Justice of <HI>Brittain,</HI> where he taught, That Princes Excommunicate for Heresie, were to be deprived of Kingdom and Life; which Book did strongly encourage me, to prosecute my attempt. This Book I read to <HI>Nevil</HI> (whom I sometimes invited to my Table) six whole Months before he accused me; afterwards he came to me and said, let us venture upon somewhat, since we can get nothing from the Queen, and he propounded several things about the deli∣very of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>: But I have (said I) a greater business in my Mind, and of more advantage for the Catholic Church. The next day he came and swore up∣on the Bible, that he would conceal, and constantly persue any thing that should be for the good of the Catholic Religion, and I sware the like, we then resolved with ten more Men to set upon the Queen, as she rode abroad to take the Air, and to kill her: All which <HI>Nevil</HI> concealed till now. But having heard, that the Earl of <HI>Westmorland</HI> was dead, whose Estate he hath already swallowed in hopes, he presently brake his Oath, and accused me of these things.</Q></P>

<P>YOƲR Majesty may see, by my voluntary Confession, the dangerous Fruits of a discontented Mind, and how constantly I pursued my first conceived Purpose in <HI>Venice,</HI> for the Relief of the afflicted Catholicks, continued it in <HI>Lyons,</HI> and resolved in <HI>Paris</HI> to put it in adventure, for the Restitution of <HI>England,</HI> to the antient Obedience of the See Apostolick.</P>
<P>You may see withal, how it is commended, allowed and warranted, in Conscience, Divinity and Policy, by the Pope and some great Divines, though it be true, or likely, that most of our English Divines (loss practiced in Matters of this weight) do utterly mislike and condemn it.</P>

<P>For reformation whereof, it is enacted, <HI>That all Iesuits, Seminary Priests, and other Priests whatsoever, Ordained within or without the Queens Domini∣ons, by virtue of the Popes Authority, should depart within forty Days, That those who should afterwards return into the Kingdom, should be guilty of High-Treason.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections upon the foregoing Plots, Trea∣sons and Acts of Parliament occasioned by them.</NOTE>From which said Plots, Conspiracies and Treasons, and the said Acts of Par∣liament occasioned by the same, I observe these things amongst many others ob∣servable.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there are no Villanies that can be imagined so bad, but the <HI>Romish Clergy,</HI> even the <HI>Pope</HI> himself, will tell you is lawful to be Committed, to carry on the interest of that Religion; and instruments enough are to be found, amongst Men of that Communion, to undertake the Committing thereof, one instance whereof we have in this <HI>Parry,</HI> who did not only think it lawful, but undertook it, to murder his own <HI>Lawful Soveraign,</HI> and had Authority so to do from the Pope himself; and that he might sit in the House of Commons, must needs be Guilty of a <HI>Wilful Perjury</HI>; for by 13. <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 2. none could sit in that House, but he who first had taken the <HI>Oath of Supremacy,</HI> and that he did sit there is plain from the History, and tho it doth not appear that he had a <HI>Dispensation</HI> for it, yet 'tis not to be doubted but that he was sure of a <HI>Pardon,</HI> in case he had not a Dispensation.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="49" REF="27"/>2. That the <HI>Protestants</HI> (in those days) thought it not only lawful, but their Duty to <HI>Associate</HI> for the preservation of their <HI>Prince,</HI> and of their Religion, and having so done, they were so far from being <HI>blamed</HI> by the Parliament, that the Parliament did esteem it not only as a <HI>Lawful,</HI> but a <HI>Commendable Act,</HI> and added their Sanction, to confirm what before they judged <HI>Lawful.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That the Parliament in the 27<HI>th.</HI> Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign, were so far from questioning, their own power of determining and limiting the <HI>Crown,</HI> and the <HI>Suc∣cession</HI> thereof, that they did not only think it in their Power, but reduced it into Act too, to make the Successor Guilty of High Treason, that should imbrue His or Her hands in the Blood of the Predecessor: and hereby altered the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. H. 7.4. Fitz. Abr. tit. Parl. 3. Bro. Abr. tit. Parl. 37. Plowd. 238. b.</NOTE> that the Accession to the Crown purges the Treason; because all Persons named in Acts of Parliament, (even the King himself) are bound by such Acts of Parliament, wherein they are named, they being no ways alterable; but by the same power (not Persons) that made them.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the severity of the Laws hitherto made, did not actually deter the <HI>Papists</HI> from Plotting and Conspiring the Death of the <HI>Queen,</HI> and the subverting the <HI>Prote∣stant</HI> Religion; Nor was it likely to be effected, so long as the <HI>Jesuits, Seminary Priests,</HI> and other <HI>Priests</HI> were tollerated here, for it hath been observed by some, with a great deal of Truth, that there was never yet a Plot against the Government, but the <HI>Po∣pish Priests</HI> had their share in it. It was therefore thought necessary to follow the example of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> and other Countries, who have banisht the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and wisely to carry it a little further, and banish <HI>Priests</HI> too they being such Disturbers of the State; which was accordingly done by 27. <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>But least the <HI>Papists</HI> should again object against the Authorities I cite for the History of the Fact, I shall here insert the very Words of their Secular Priests in their impor∣tant Considerations, whereby the truth of the Fact is Confest, the Words are these.</P>
<P><Q>About the time of the overthrow of the Popes Forces in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Secular Priests confess the truth of all the foregoing Account.</P><P>Collect. f. <HI>44.</HI> The Popes Plot with King of <HI>Spain</HI> and Duke of <HI>Guise. Mendoza.</HI></P></NOTE> his Holiness (by the false instigation of the Jesuits) plotted with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> for the assistance of the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> to enterprize upon the sudden, a very desperate design against Her Majesty: and for the Delivery and advancement to the Crown of the Queen of <HI>Scotland.</HI> For the better asserting whereof <HI>Mendoza</HI> the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> and <HI>Ledger</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> set on work (a worthy Gentleman otherwise) one Mr. <HI>Francis Throckmorton</HI> and divers others. And whilst the same was Contriving (as afterwards Mr. <HI>Throckmorton</HI> himself Confessed 1584) the Jesuitical humour had so pos∣sessed the hearts of sundry Catholics; as we do unfeignedly rue in our hearts the remembrance of it, and are greatly ashamed that any Person so intitl'd should ever have been so extreamly bewitched: Two Gentlemen about that time also, <HI>viz. Anno</HI> 1583. Mr. <HI>Arden</HI> and Mr. <HI>Somervil</HI> were convicted by the Laws of the Realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Throgmor∣tons <HI>Confession you have Prin∣ted,</HI> Camb. <HI>An∣nal. l.</HI> 3. <HI>f.</HI> 297. Arden <HI>and</HI> So∣mervil.</P><P><HI>Dr.</HI> Parry. <HI>Earl of</HI> Nor∣thumberland.</P></NOTE> for ha∣ving purposed and contrived how they might have laid violent hands upon Her Maje∣sties sacred Person. Mr. <HI>Somervils</HI> Confession therein was so notorious, as it may not be either quallified or denied. And Dr. <HI>Parry</HI> the same Year was plotting with Jesuits, how he might have effected the like Villany: How the worthy <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> was about this time brought into the said Plot by the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> (then still in hand) we will pretermit. Mr. <HI>Parsons,</HI> that was Actor in it, could tell the Story very roundly at <HI>Rome,</HI> it wrought the Earls overthrow in 1585, which may justly be ascribed to the Jesuitical Practices of the Jesuite <HI>Mendoza,</HI> and others of that Crew.</Q> They mentioned several other Treasons, which I shall not here take Notice of, but reserve them till I come to give the further Account of their Treasons, and only set down the Conclusion of this Paragraph. <Q>These things <HI>(say they)</HI> we would not have touched, had they not been known in effect to this part of the World, and that we thought it our Duties to shew our own dislike of them, and to clear Her Majesty (so far as we may) from such imputations of more then barbarous Cruelty towards us, as the <HI>Jesuits</HI> in their Writings have cast <HI>by Heaps</HI> upon her: They themselves (as we still think in our Consciences, and before God) having been, from time to time, the very Causes of all the Calamities which any of us have endu∣red in <HI>England,</HI> since Her Majesties Reign; which we do not write simply to excuse Her Highness, altho we must Confess we can be contented to indure much, rather then to seek her Dishonour: but for that we think few Princes living, being perswa∣ded in Religion as Her Majesty is, and so provoked as she hath been; would have dealt more mildly with such their Subjects (all Circumstances considered) then she hath done with us.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="28"/>Let us now see what reason can be given for making the rest of the Penal Laws, that were made against the Papists in this Queens Reign.</P>

Bakers Chron. <HI>f.</HI> 367.</NOTE> same year, a very dangerous Conspiracy was discovered against Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> in the <HI>English</HI> Seminary at <HI>Rheimes,</HI> there were some who were so bigotted to the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion, that they thought the Pope could by his Authority, do any thing, and that the aforementioned Bull of <HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> for deposing the Queen was dicta∣ted by the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and thought it a <HI>Meritorious</HI> Act to take away her Life, and doubted not of a <HI>Canonisation,</HI> as <HI>Martyrs,</HI> if they fell in the Attempt. <HI>William Gifford</HI> Doctor in Divinity, <HI>Gilbert Gifford,</HI> and one <HI>Hodgson</HI> Priests did so infuse this treasona∣ble Doctrine into the mind of one <HI>John Savage,</HI> a <HI>Bastard</HI> as was reported, that he readily Vowed to kill the Queen.</P>
<P>One <HI>Ballard,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Priest at <HI>Rheimes,</HI> bestirs himself in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> for carrying on the Design, and for that purpose, prepares Disciples, then goeth into <HI>France,</HI> and treats with <HI>Mendoza</HI> before named, <HI>Charles Paget</HI> and others, about invading of <HI>England,</HI> judging they could never have a fairer opportunity, then at that Juncture of time, forasmuch as the <HI>Pope,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> were all resolved to set upon <HI>England,</HI> thereby to divert the War from the <HI>Ne∣therlands:</HI> Having delivered the Message there he returns for <HI>England</HI> to promote the design here, gets to <HI>London,</HI> where in a Souldiers habit, under the false Name of Cap∣tain <HI>Fescue</HI> he agitates the Plot.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Babington</HI> and divers other Gentlemen en∣gaged in this de∣sign of taking off the Queen.</NOTE>At <HI>London</HI> he discovered this Affair to one Mr. <HI>Anthony Babington</HI> of <HI>Dethick</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> a young Gentleman greatly addicted to the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, and who had in <HI>France</HI> Commenced an Acquaintance with the Bishop of <HI>Glascow,</HI> the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> Ambassador, and one <HI>Thomas Morgan</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Fugitive, and a busie Agent for her. <HI>Babington</HI> at first, was of opinion, that as long as the Queen lived, an Invasion would signifie little or nothing, but when he understood, that <HI>Savage</HI> had undertaken to remove that Obstacle by killing her, altered his opinion; but was for joyning five more to <HI>Savage,</HI> to make sure of the Matter: Which being agreed on, they set forward the design of the Invasion. The design was by <HI>Babington</HI> imparted to the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> and she was to reward the Heroical Actors in this barbarous Attempt, or else their <HI>Posterities,</HI> in Case they perisht in it. And he was Commanded to pass his word to the six Gentlemen and the rest, concerning their re∣ward for their Service. In this Conspiracy were ingaged, divers Gentlemen who were very Zealous for Popery. <HI>Edward Windsor,</HI> Brother to the Lord <HI>Windsor, Thomas Salis∣bury</HI> of a Knights Family in <HI>Denbeighshire, Charles Tilney</HI> of an ancient Family, who was then but lately reconciled to the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, <HI>Chideock Tichburn</HI> of <HI>Southampton, Ed∣ward Abbington</HI> whose Father had been the Queens under Treasurer, <HI>Robert Gage</HI> of <HI>Surry, John Travers,</HI> and <HI>John Charnock</HI> of <HI>Lancashire, John Jones,</HI> whose Father was Yeoman of the Wardrobe to Queen <HI>Mary, Savage</HI> before named, <HI>Barnwel</HI> of a noble Family in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Henry Dun</HI> Clark in the Office of first Fruits and Tenths, and one <HI>Polley.</HI></P>
<P>To every of these Gentlemen was a Part in this Conspiracy assigned, and all things went according to their hearts desire, as they thought. Nothing perplexed <HI>Babing∣ton,</HI> But his Fears of being failed in the <HI>Foreign Aid,</HI> that was promised him, therefore to make sure of it, he resolved himself to go over into <HI>France,</HI> and to that purpose to send <HI>Ballard</HI> privately before, for whom by his Money, under a Counterfeit name, he procured a License to Travel. And that there might not be the least Suspicion of himself, he insinuated into Secretary <HI>Walsingham,</HI> by means of <HI>Polley,</HI> and earnestly be∣sought him to procure him a License from the Queen to travel into <HI>France,</HI> promising her to do her extraordinary good Service, in pumping out, and discovering the secret designs of the Fugitives in behalf of the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plot disco∣vered.</NOTE> but, as we say, forewarned forearmed, he being a faithful and cunning Secretary, by his Spies had discovered all,
<PB N="51" REF="28"/>
and informed the Queen, and therefore only commended <HI>Babingtons</HI> pretended design, and made him fair Promises, and so from time to time delayed him. The chief instru∣ment in discovering this Plot, was one <HI>Gilbert Gifford,</HI> (who lurked in <HI>England</HI> under the Name of <HI>Lauson</HI> in mind <HI>Salvage</HI> of his Oath) but had informed the Secretary what he was, and to what purpose sent into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This having gone on for some time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ballard</HI> appre∣hended.</NOTE> the Queen apprehending there might be great danger in letting it proceed further, ordered <HI>Ballard</HI> to be apprehended who was seiz∣ed on before he was aware in <HI>Babingtons</HI> House, just as he was setting out for <HI>France, Babington</HI> and some others of the Confederates, being jealous the design was discovered, hid themselves in St. <HI>Johns</HI> Wood near <HI>London.</HI> Notice being given of their with∣drawing, they are proclaimed Traitors, at last are found, and seized on, and the rest of their fellow Rebels, fourteen of whom were executed in <HI>September</HI> 1586. in St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the Fields, where they used to meer, and consult about their intended mur∣thering of the Queen, and invading the Kingdom.</P>

<P>The next thing this Parliament did, was by their Votes to approve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tryal and Condemnation of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> appro∣ved, and Her Execution de∣sired by the Parliament, and their Rea∣sons for it.

They were drawn from the dangers that threatned Religion, the Queens Person, and the Realm by means of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> who having been bred up in the <HI>Popish</HI> Re∣ligion, and sworn a <HI>confederate</HI> in the <HI>Holy</HI> League for the extirpation of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Reli∣gion, had now for a long time Arrogated unto her self, the Title of <HI>Queen of</HI> England while the Queen lived, whom as being excommunicate, she held it lawful to do mischief to, (as far as lay in her Power) and to take away her life, a thing <HI>meritorious:</HI> One who had over-thrown, and ruined sundry flourishing Families in the Kingdom, and cherished all the Treasonable designs and Rebellions in <HI>England,</HI> to spare her there∣fore, were nothing else but to spoil the People, who would take impunity in this Case much to heart, and would not think themselves discharged of their Oath of <HI>Association,</HI> unless she were punished according to her deserts, and lastly they called to her re∣membrance, how fearful the examples of Gods vengeance were upon King <HI>Saul</HI> for sparing <HI>Agag,</HI> and upon King <HI>Ahab</HI> for sparing the Life of <HI>Benhaddad.</HI></P>
<P>These Reasons were strongly inforc't by a Petition presented by the Parliament to the Queen: and by her answer it appears, what a great straight she was in,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>D' <HI>Ewes</HI> Journal, <HI>f. 400.</HI></P><P>Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> in a great streight.</P><P><HI>Camb.</HI> Annal. <HI>f. 363, 364, 365.</HI></P></NOTE> between her Natural inclinations to mercy backt with the consideration of the near Relation the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> stood in to her, and the danger her Person and the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion were in, sufficiently evidenced by an <HI>Oath</HI> which she her self said she had seen, where∣in some had bound themselves to kill her within a Month. <Q>By which, she said, she saw her Subjects danger in her Person, which she would be careful to prevent; she told them she had not forgot the <HI>Association,</HI> they had entred into for her safety, which was a thing she never somuch as thought of, till a great number of Hands and Seals to it were shewn her, that it had laid a perpetual tie and obligation upon her, to bear them a singular good Will and Love: That she had no greater comfort then in the Common-Wealths respect and affection towards her, and promised them that whatsoever the best of Subjects might expect at the hands of the best Princes, they might expect from her to be performed to the full.</Q></P>
<P>After this she sent to the Lords by the Chancellor, and to the Commons by their Speaker <HI>Puckering,</HI> to enter anew into the consideration of this Matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A message from Qu. <HI>Eliz.</HI> to the Parliament. <HI>Camb.</HI> Annal. <HI>l. 3. f. 365.</HI></NOTE> and to find out a more pleasing expedient, whereby both the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> Life might be spared, and her own security provided for.</P>
<P>They Concur again in their former Opinion for these Reasons;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment Concur in their former Opinion, their Reasons for it.</NOTE> the Queens safety (they said) could no ways be secured so long as the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> lived, unless she should either seriously repent, and acknowledge her offence; or were kept with a closer or stricter Guard, and sufficient security given by Bond, or Oath for her good Demean∣our, or delivered <HI>Hostages,</HI> or else departed the <HI>Realm.</HI> They proved by invincible Reasons, that neither by expectation of Reformation in the disposition of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> (if the Queens Majesty should spare her Life.) Nor yet by safer or stronger Garding of her Person, nor by her promise upon word, or Oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D' <HI>Ewes</HI> Journal, <HI>f. 405.</HI></NOTE> nor by the <HI>Hostages</HI> of other Princes or Allies, nor by her Banishment, nor by the revocation of the <HI>Bull</HI> of Pope <HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> nor yet by the Bond or Word of a Prince, or of any or all the Princes her Allies, nor by any other way or means whatsoever, other then by the speedy Execution to Death of the said <HI>Scottish</HI> Queen, the safety or continuance of the true Religion, of the most Royal Person of the Queens Majesty, and all the peaceable State of this Realm, could in any ways be provided for and Established.

<P>The Answer to this Speech will, I hope, give the Reader great satisfaction, as to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s proceedure in this weighty concern; and therefore I have here in∣serted it <HI>verbatim,</HI> as I find it in <HI>Cambden,</HI> which is as followeth:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Queens Speech in An∣swer to the Parliaments Reasons.</P><P><HI>Camb.</HI> Annal. <HI>f. 366.</HI></P></NOTE><Q>Very unpleasing is that way where the setting out Progress and Journeys end, yield nothing but trouble and vexation. I have this day been in greater conflict with my self then ever I was in all my Life; whether I should speak or hold my peace? If I should speak and not complain, I shall dissemble, if I should be silent; all your Labour and Pains taken were in vain; and if I should complain, it might seem a strange and unusual thing. Yet I confess, that my hearty desire was, that some other means might have been devised to provide for your security and my own safety, then this which is now propounded: So that I cannot but complain, tho not of you; yet to you, since I perceive by your Petition, that my safety dependeth wholly upon the ruin of another. If there be any that think I have spun out the time on pur∣pose to get commendation by a seeming shew of Clemency; they do me wrong un∣deservedly, as he knoweth, who is the searcher of the most secret thoughts of the Heart; or if there be any that are perswaded, the Commissioners durst pronounce no other Sentence, for fear they should displease me, or seem to fail of their Care for my preservation, they do but wrong me with such injurious conceits; for either those whom I have put in Trust, have failed of their Duties; or else they acquainted the Commissioners in my Name, that my will and pleasure was, that every one should act freely according to his Conscience; and what they thought not fit to be made publick, that they should communicate to me in private. It was of my favourable inclination towards her, that I desired some other way might be found out to prevent this mis∣chief. But since it is now resolved, that my security is desperate without her death, I find a great reluctancy and trouble within me, that I, who have, in my time, pardon∣ed so many Rebels, wincked at so many Treasons, or neglected them by silence, should now seem to shew my self cruel towards so great a Princess.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have since I came to the Government of this Realm, seen many defamatory Libels and Pamphlets against me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> foresaw she should be reflected upon for this Acti∣on, but by the <HI>Papists only.</HI> She could not suspect the <HI>Pro∣testants</HI> would judge hereby of her, or censure her.</NOTE> taxing me to be a <HI>Tyrant,</HI> wellfaret he Writers hearts; I be∣lieve their meaning was to tell me News; and News indeed it was to me to be branded with the note of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> I would it were as great news to hear of their wickedness and impieties. But what is it which they will not venture to write now, when they shall hear that I have given my consent, that the Executioners hands should be em∣brewed in the Blood of my nearest Kinswoman? But so far am I from cruelty, that though it were to save my own Life; I would not offer her the least violence: Nei∣ther have I been so careful how to prolong mine own Life, as how to preserve both hers and mine: which that it is now impossible to do, I am heartily troubled; I am not so void of sence and judgment; as not to see mine own danger before mine Eyes; nor so indiscreet as to sharpen a Sword to cut my own Throat; nor so egregiously careless, as not to provide for the safty of mine own Life. This I consider with my self; that many a Man would hazzard his own Life; to save the Life of a Princess; but I am not of their opinion, these things have I many times thought upon seriously with my self.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But since so many have both written and spoken against me, give me leave I pray you, to say somewhat in mine own defence, that ye may see what manner of Woman I am, for whose safety and preservation you have taken such extraordinary care, wherein as I do with a most thankful heart discern and read your great vigilancy; so I am sure, I shall never requite it, had I as many lives as all you together.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When first I took the Scepter into my hand, I was not unmindful of God the giver, and therefore I began my Reign with securing his Service, and the Religion I have been both born-in, bred in, and I trust shall dye in: And though I was not ignorant how many dangers I should meet withal at home for my altering Religion, and how ma∣ny great Princes abroad of a contrary Profession, would in that respect bear an Hostile mind towards me; yet was I no whit, dismayed thereat, knowing that God, whom alone I eyed and respected, would defend both me and my Cause. Hence it is, that so
<PB N="55" REF="38"/>
many Treacheries and Conspiracies have been attempted against me, that I might well admire to find my self alive at this present day, were it not that Gods holy hand hath still protected me beyond all Expectations. Next, to the end I might make the better progress in the Art of Ruling well; I had long and serious Consultations with my self, what things were most worthy and becoming Kings to do, and I found it absolutely necessary that they should be compleatly furnished with those prime Capital Vertues, Justice, Temperance, Prudence and Magnanimity: Of the two latter I will not boast my self, my Sex doth not permit it, they are proper to Men; but for the two former and less rough, I dare say (and that without ostentation) I never made a difference of Persons, but high and low had equally right done them; I never preferred any for favour, whom I thought not fit and worthy; I never was forward to believe Storys at the first telling; nor was I so rash as to suffer my Judgement to be forestalled with prejudice before I had heard the Cause. I will not say but many reports might happily be brought me too much in favour of the one side or the other: for a good and wary Prince may sometimes be bought and sold, whilst we cannot hear all our selves; yet this I dare say boldly, my Judgment (as far as I could understand the Case) ever went with truth. And as <HI>Alcibiades</HI> advised his friend, not to give any answer till he had run over the Letters of the whole Alphabet, so have I never used rash and sudden resolutions in any thing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And therefore as touching your Councils and Consultations, I acknowledge them to have been with such care and Providence, and so advantageous, for the preservation of my Life, and to proceed from hearts so sincere and devoted to me, that I shall endea∣vour what lyes in my power, to give you cause to think your pains not ill bestowed, and strive to shew my self worthy of such Subjects.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And now for your Petition, I desire you for the present to content your selves, with an answer without answer; your Judgement I condemn not, neither do I mislike your reason, but I must desire you to excuse those thoughtful doubts and cares, which as yet perplex my Mind; and so rest satisfied with the profession of my thankful esteem of your affections, and the answer I have given, if you take it for any answer at all; if I should say I will not do what you request, I might say perhaps more than I in∣tend; and if I should say I would do it, I might plunge my self into as bad inconveni∣encies as you endeavour to perswade me from: which I am confident your wisdom and discretions would not that I should, if you consider the circumstances of place, time, and the manner and conditions of Men.</Q></P>
<P>In <HI>December</HI> 1586. the Parliament was prorogued saith <HI>Cambden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">D' Ewes <HI>Jour. f.</HI> 407.</NOTE> Adjourned (saith D' <HI>Ewes</HI>) to the 15th of <HI>February,</HI> and thence ajourned to the 22 of <HI>February,</HI> and soon after, notice was given to the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> of her Sentence, which she received joyfully, and seemed to Triumph that she was taken for an instrument for introducing Popery. But a <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Dean</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> carriage to a Bi∣shop and Dean of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P><P><HI>Camb.</HI> Annals f. <HI>308.</HI></P></NOTE> being commended to her, to fit her for Death, she rejected them, and sharply taxed the <HI>English</HI> Nation, saying that the <HI>English, had many times put their own Kings to death, no marvel there¦fore if they now also shewed their cruelty upon her, who was issued from the Blood of their Kings.</HI></P>
<P>After her Sentence was published (before any Warrant for her Execution) People vented their several Opinions, some for it, some against it, I shall Wave all but the then <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours Reasons on the behalf of the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Answer to those Reasons, as they are related by <HI>Cambden,</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>That it very much concerned the most Christian King of</HI> France, <HI>and all other Kings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> Ambassadours Reasons against executing the Queen of <HI>Scots. Camb.</HI> Annals f. <HI>374.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that a Queen, a free and absolute Princess, should not be put to death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Queens safety would not be more endangered by the death of Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>then it would be by her Life: That if she were delivered out of Prison, she could probably attempt nothing against the Queen, being now in a sickly condition and having but a short time to live.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That although she had laid claim to the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>she was not to be blamed for it, but it was wholly to be imputed to her young and tender Years, and to bad Coun∣cellors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="39"/><HI>That she came at first a supplicant into</HI> England, <HI>and therefore having been unjustly de∣tained, she was now at length to be either ransomed, or mercifully dealt withal. Moreover, that an absolute Prince was not to be called in question, which made</HI> Tully, <HI>say,</HI> So unsual a thing it is for a King to be put to death, for any Crime, that before this time, it was never so much as heard of,</P>
<P><HI>That if she were Innocent, she were not to be punished; if Guilty she was to be spared; for this would turn to far greater honour and advantage, and would be recorded eternally, as an example of the</HI> English <HI>Clemency. That the story of</HI> Porsenna <HI>in this Case was to be remembred, who snatched the right hand of</HI> Mutius Scaevola <HI>out of the Fire, and set him at Liberty, though he had Conspired his Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That it was a prime Rule and Precept for well Governing, to be sparing of Blood; that Blood cryeth for Blood: That to use the extreamity of rigour towards her, could not but seem a cruel and bloody Part.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the</HI> French <HI>King would do his best to repel and frustrate the Attemps of all Men what∣soever, who should offer violence to the Queen: and that the</HI> Guises, <HI>the Queen of</HI> Scots <HI>near Kinsmen, would engage themselves to do the like by Oath and Covenant under their hands, who in Case she should be put to death, would take it very hardly and haply not leave her unrevenged.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly, they required she might not be proceeded against according to so rigorous, and ex∣traordinary a Sentence: Otherwise the</HI> French <HI>King, could not but take very great displeasure thereat, howsoever other Princes should hap to resent it.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Answer to those Reasons.</NOTE>To these Reasons Answer was made from Point to Point as followeth.</P>
<P>That the Queen of <HI>England</HI> trusted, the most Christian King of <HI>France</HI> would have no less a regard and respect for her, then he had for the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> who had practised the destruction of an Innocent Princess, her near Kinswoman, and a Confederate with the <HI>French</HI> King. That it was expedient and necessary for Kings and Common-wealths, that wicked attempts (especially against Princes) should not go unpunished.</P>
<P>That the <HI>English,</HI> which acknowledged the Soveraign Authority of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> only in <HI>England,</HI> could not acknowledge two Supream free and absolute Princes in <HI>England</HI> at one time, or account any other whomsoever, equal to her in <HI>England</HI> as long as she lived. Neither indeed did they see, how the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> and her Son who at present Reigneth, can be reputed both at one time for Supream and Abso∣lute Princes.</P>
<P>Whether the Queens safety would be exposed to greater danger upon her being Exe∣cuted, depended upon future Accidents and Contingences; the Estates of <HI>England,</HI> upon serious deliberations of the Matter, thought otherwise there would never be occasions wanting for bad attempts, especially when the Matter was now come to that pass, that the one had no hope of safety, unless the other were ruined: and this saying they might call to Mind <HI>aut ego illam, aut illa me,</HI> either I must take away her Life, or she will take away mine. The shorter the time to come of her Life was, the sooner and more eagerly would the Conspirators hasten the Queens danger.</P>
<P>That the Title which she claimed to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> she would not yet re∣nounce, and therefore she was with good reason detained in Prison, and so to be de∣tained (though she came a Supplicant into <HI>England</HI>) till she had renounced the same, and the Crimes which she had committed since she was Prisoner, she ought to suffer for, whatever were the Cause of her first casting into Prison.</P>
<P>That the Queen had formerly most Graciously spared her Life, when by unani∣mous consent of the Estates, she was Condemned for a Rebellion raised, about an in∣tended Marriage between her and the Duke of <HI>Norfolk:</HI> and to spare her again, were but unadvised and cruel pity; that no man was ignorant of that saying of the Lawyers. <HI>A Man offending in anothers Territory, and there found, is punished in the Place of his Offence, without regard of his Dignity, Honour or Priviledge</HI>: And that this was both justi∣fiable by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and by the Examples of <HI>Licinius, Robert</HI> King of <HI>Scicily,
<PB N="57" REF="39"/>
Bernard</HI> King of <HI>Italy, Couradine, Elizabeth</HI> Queen of <HI>Hungary, Joan</HI> Queen of <HI>Naples,</HI> and <HI>Dejotants</HI>; for whom <HI>Tully</HI> pleading, said, it was no unjust thing that a King should be found Guilty, and put to Death, though it were not usual: For thus the words run, <HI>which I speak first touching a Kings forfeiture of Life and Estate, which thing though it be not unjust, especially when thy Life is in danger from him, yet is it so un∣sual,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That she ought to be punished, having been found Guilty upon a just and legal Tryal; considering that what is just, the same is honest, and what is honest, is also profitable and Expedient.</P>
<P>That the Story of <HI>Porsenna</HI> suited not with the present Case, unless a Man should imagine a numerous Combinations of men to have laid wait for the Queens Life, and should thereupon perswade her to let the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> at Liberty without any hurt, out of a fear of them, with some regard to her own honour, but none to her safety, as <HI>Porsenna</HI> discharged <HI>Mutius,</HI> after he had affirmed that three hundred like himself had Conspired and vowed his death: Moreover, <HI>Mutius</HI> attempted this against <HI>Porsenna,</HI> in a just and declared War; and when <HI>Mutius</HI> was let go, <HI>Porsenna</HI> verily perswaded himself that all the danger was over; but the Case here is quite otherwise.</P>
<P>That Blood indeed is to be spared, but it must be inoncent Blood, this God hath commanded. True it is indeed, that the voice of innocent Blood crieth for Blood; and this can <HI>France</HI> both before and since the Massacre at <HI>Paris,</HI> well witness and testifie.</P>
<P>That Death that is justly inflicted cannot seem Bloody; as is neither Physic prapared duly, and as it ought to be, esteemed violent.</P>
<P>That howsoever the <HI>Guises,</HI> the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> Kinsmen, might take the Matter, yet it highly concerned the Queen, to regard rather the safety of her self, the Nobility and People of <HI>England</HI> (upon whose love and affection she wholly depended) then the displeasure of any whomsoever.</P>
<P>That the Matter was come to that pass, that what was said of old concerning two Princes, <HI>Couradine</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Anjou,</HI> might now be spoken of two Queens, it might now be truely said, <HI>the Death of</HI> Mary <HI>is the Life of</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>and the Life of</HI> Mary <HI>the Death of</HI> Elizabeth.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> King or the <HI>Guises</HI> promises could not secure the Queen and Realm, much less make satisfaction for her Life, if she should be made away.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> King could neither discover nor hinder secret Plots against himself at home, much less was he like to hinder those against the Queen of <HI>England</HI>: For Treason is plotted in secret, and therefore hard to be prevented, if the fact were once committed, what would it avail to claim their Promises? how should an incomparable Prince's death be made amends for? and in so sad and woful a Confusion of all things, what Remedy could be found for the languishing Common-wealth?</P>
<P>That the Obligations and Oaths of the <HI>Guises</HI> were of small value, who judged it Meritorious to kill the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI>'s Adversaries, and could easily procure Dispensati∣ons for their Oaths, and what <HI>Englishman,</HI> if Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> were slain, and the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> of the house of <HI>Guise,</HI> advanced to the Crown, durst accuse them of the Murther? and if any should accuse them; could they thereby make her alive again?</P>

<P>The Catholics abroad, the Pope, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Princes of the League, the Papists at home and their Ministers.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Principal Root hereof:</HEAD>
<P>The Councel of <HI>Trent</HI> which agreed to extirpate Christian Religion (which they term Heresie) whereunto divers Princes assented, and bound themselves in solemn Manner.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Pius Quintus</HI> sent his Excommunication against Her Majesty. <HI>Dr. Mourton</HI> and <HI>Mendoza</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador bestirred them, a Northren Rebellion was bred, the Pope and the rest Practiced for the <HI>Scottish</HI> Queen, and she being acquainted proceeds by her means.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Paulus</HI> the thirteenth proceeds and sends Jesuites and Seminaries to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and they proceed to inveagle the the Subjects, and disswade them from obedience. <HI>Viska</HI> beginneth a Rebellion in <HI>Ireland, James Fitz Morris</HI> furthereth the Execution thereof. Doctor <HI>Saunders</HI> and <HI>Desmond</HI> stir new Rebellion there, and wrote into <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Parry</HI> was moved to kill Her Majesty, and perswaded it was Me∣ritorious.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fifth imitateth the other Popes, to execute their former Devices, and writeth to the Cardinal of <HI>Lorain</HI> and <HI>Guise</HI>; that he will overthrow the Gospel (which Mr. <HI>Vice Chamberlain</HI> honourably termed the glorious Gospel) and therefore moved them to joyn with the Princes of the League, and to practice to win the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and to set up the <HI>Scottish</HI> Queen in <HI>England,</HI> and make his reckoning of the <HI>Cantons</HI> that were <HI>Popish,</HI> the <HI>Switzers,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> they Duke of <HI>Ferara,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and King of <HI>France:</HI> A chief Instrument to work this was one <HI>Carew,</HI> called also Father <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>He was sent into <HI>Germany,</HI> and over <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> wrote to the <HI>Scottish</HI> Queen, that the Powers will joyn to overthrow <HI>England,</HI> and make known the effect of his Labour to the <HI>Pope.</HI> Invasion should have been made into <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> the last year, and not like to be unattempted this year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pope</HI> Excommunicateth the King of <HI>Navar</HI>; the <HI>Pope</HI> accounteth not of <HI>Popish</HI> Prea∣ching and perswasions that way; But nevertheless moveth all to use the Word, and for maintenance thereof spareth his Treasure otherwise, and withdraweth maintenance from Jesuites, Seminaries; and divers other Letters were found with the <HI>Scottish</HI> Queen, which prove all these to be true. If we serve Almighty God in sincerity of <HI>Heart,</HI> we need not to fear. It is to be remembred that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> sought to recover some part of his Fathers Credit, by using our Treasure and Force to get St. <HI>Quintines</HI>; but he soon made his advantage of it, and regarded not our Territo∣ries in <HI>France</HI>: But suffered the loss of <HI>Calice</HI> and all our Territories; and after the Death of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> what he could. Her Majesty sought for his Good-will, sending the Lord <HI>Mountague,</HI> the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> Sr. <HI>Thomas Chamberlain</HI> Knight, Mr. <HI>Maun</HI> and others, and they were but hardly used, some of them were offered great indignity, and Mr. <HI>Mauns</HI> Son forced by strength to do a kind of Pennance.

<P>We must look to the <HI>Papists</HI> at home and abroad. It hath touched us in the Blood of the Nobility, and the Blood of many Subjects.</P>
<P>They practice to frame Subjects against all Duty, and bring in Doctrine of Law∣fulness and Merit to kill the Queen, and have sent their Instruments abroad to that purpose.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding things stood thus, yet the Parliament having made so many Laws, thought convenient, to make but one Law this <HI>Session</HI> against the <HI>Papists,</HI> which was not made Provisory of any new Remedy against them, but to enforce the Execution only of a former Law. It is entitled, An <HI>Act for the more speedy and due Execution of certain Branches of the</HI> Stat. 23. Eliz. <HI>intitled, An Act to retain the Queens Majesties Sub∣jects in their due obedience.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29. Eliz. cap. 6, Rast. Stat. 2. Part. <HI>f.</HI> 338. <HI>An Act to en∣force the Exe∣cution of</HI> 23. Eliz.</NOTE>By which Act, <HI>For the avoiding all Frauds and Delays, in hinderance of the Execution of the said Act, it is provided; that certain assurances made by Pa∣pists shall be void against the Queen: That the Conviction shall be at the Kings Bench, or at the Assizes or general Goal Delivery; and certified into the Exche∣quer: The twenty pounds a month for not going to Church is to be paid into the Exchequer every Easter and Michaelmas Term; In default of Payment the Queen may take all the Goods, and two parts of the Lands and Leases of the Offenders.

<P>Thus did the Plots and Conspiracies of the <HI>Papists,</HI> from time to time, force the State to make either New Laws against them, or else Laws for the more effectual exe∣cuting the old; for the truth of the Plots and Conspiracies before mentioned, I shall here insert the very words of the Secular Priests in their important Considerations as hereunto followeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Secular Priests Con∣fession of the <HI>Plots</HI> before-mentioned.

And especially it was wondred at a while, until the Drift thereof appeared more manifestly in the year 1588) that the said worthy Person laid down this for a ground, in justifying the said <HI>Stanley. viz.</HI> that in all
<PB N="61" REF="41"/>
Wars which may happen for Religion, every <HI>Catholick</HI> Man is bound <HI>in Conscience,</HI> to employ his Person and Force, by the <HI>Popes</HI> Direction, <HI>viz.</HI> how, for, when, and where, either at home or abroad, he may and must break with his Temporal Sove∣raign.</Q></P>
<P>Let us now see what was further doing by the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Papists,</HI> against the <HI>Protestant</HI> Queen, and the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion in <HI>England,</HI> in the Year 1588, and we shall doubtless see very good reason for making the Statute of 35 <HI>Eliz. Ca.</HI> 2. which was the last Law that was made against them in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pope,</HI> some Religious Persons in <HI>Spain,</HI> and several <HI>English</HI> Fugitives,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Pope plot∣ting again.</HI> Camb. Annal. <HI>f.</HI> 402. Ba∣ker's Chron. <HI>f.</HI> 374.</NOTE> had called back the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to his former Designs for the Conquest of <HI>England,</HI> which had been interrupted by the Portugal Wars; earnestly exhorting him, that seeing God had given him Success in laying <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies</HI> to his Dominions, he would do something which should be acceptable to God, and becoming the Grandeur and Maje∣sty of the <HI>Catholic</HI> King, that nothing could be more, then the propagating and en∣larging the Church of God, which could not be more gloriously, nor more <HI>meritori∣ously</HI> done, then by the Conquest of <HI>England,</HI> re-planting the <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Religion, and abolishing <HI>Heresie</HI> there. They suggested, that this War would be just, because it was necessary, as also because it was for the Maintainance of Christs Religion; in re∣gard, That the Queen of <HI>England</HI> being excommunicate, persisted contumaciously a∣gainst the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> supported his Rebels in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> annoyed the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> by continual Depredations, suppressed and sackt his Towns in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> and had very lately put the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> to Death, violating thereby the Majesty of all Kings: That it would be no less profitable than just, for so he should add to his Empire those three Kingdoms, quell the Rebellion in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> secure his Voyages to the <HI>Indies,</HI> without the Expence of Convoys. To prove this, they sug∣gested, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Navy did far exceed the <HI>English</HI> in Number, Largeness of Ships, and Strength, especially considering the Addition of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Fleet; that <HI>England</HI> had no Forts nor defences, that it was unprovided of Commanders, Souldiers, Cavalry and Munition, bare of Wealth and Friends; that there were many <HI>Papists</HI> who would presently joyn with him; that so great was the Strength of <HI>Spain,</HI> and so unmatchable their Valour, that none durst oppose them; and confidently assured themselves of Victory; That this Opportunity was offered by God himself, a Peace being then concluded with the <HI>Turk,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> embroiled in a Civil War: That the Conquest of <HI>England</HI> would be far easier than the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> in respect the Cut from <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>England</HI> was much more short and convenient, than from <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>Nether∣lands.</HI> That in order to the Conquest of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> it was necessary, first to con∣quer <HI>England,</HI> and that <HI>England</HI> being once conquered, the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> must of ne∣cessity be subdued.</P>

<P>The Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> also in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Kings Command, built Ships, and many Flat-bottomed Boats, and other great Preparations in the Sea Towns of <HI>Flanders,</HI> he had an Army of an hundred and three Companies of Foot, and four thousand Horse; amongst which were one thousand <HI>English</HI> Fugitives, who of all others, were least esteemed; neither was <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>William Stanley</HI> before named.</NOTE> <HI>Stanley,</HI> who had the Command of them, nor others who offered their Service and Council once heard; but for their unnatural∣ness to their Country, they were debarred from all access, and (as most inauspicious Persons) worthily, and with Detestation rejected.</P>

<P><Q>The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> at length, as well by his <HI>Holiness</HI>'s Authority and Exhortati∣ons, as by his own unspeakable Zeal and Piety, moved also not a little by my hum∣ble and continual Suit, together with the afflicted and banished <HI>Catholicks</HI> of our Nati∣on, of all and every Degree, who have been by his special Compassion, and Regal Munificency, principally supported in this our long Exile, hath condescended at last, to take upon him this so holy and glorious an Act, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And then proceeds to encourage, nay, and threaten too, the <HI>English</HI> to take up Arms against their Queen, and to joyn with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other Invaders.—<Q>If you will avoid the <HI>Popes,</HI> the <HI>Kings</HI> and other <HI>Princes</HI> high Indignation; let no Man, of what Degree soever, obey, abet, aid, defend, or acknowledge her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>—Ad∣ding—<Q>That otherwise they should incur the Angels Curse and Malediction, and be as deeply excommunicated as any, because that in taking her part, they should fight against God, against their <HI>Lawful</HI> King <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg2">How com∣eth <HI>Philip</HI> to be lawful King of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> against their Country, and not∣withstanding
<PB N="64" REF="43"/>
withstanding all they should do, they should but defend her bootless, to their own pre∣sent Destruction and eternal Shame.</Q></P>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Foulis</HI> relates out of <HI>Clark</HI> a Secular Priest, is so remarkable with relati∣on to this Invasion, that I cannot omit it, saith he, and quotes his Author.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> you shall hear what <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg2"><HI>C. W.</HI> A Reply to Fa∣ther <HI>Parson</HI>'s Libel, <HI>f. 64, 65.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Clark</HI> the Priest saith, who with <HI>Watson,</HI> suffered afterward for Treason against King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>It is most certain, that all the World had very admirable Expectance of that Army, and the Jesuits more than any.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>It is plain by the Cardinals Book (if</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg2">They would hint to us, as if <HI>Parsons</HI> were the Com∣piler of the Ad∣monition; but its certain that <HI>Allen</HI> was the Author of it, and <HI>Parsons</HI> with the other Romanists con∣fess <HI>Allen</HI> to be the Author.</NOTE> <HI>it were his) writen as a Preparative to that Account, that he was made Cardinal on purpose for that Exploit, and to have been sent hither presently upon the</HI> Spaniards <HI>Conquest. But Father</HI> Parsons <HI>saith, that he laboured to set forward, at that time, the</HI> Cardinals <HI>Preferment (if you will believe him) which maketh it evident,</HI> à primo ad ultimum, <HI>that Father Parsons was a Dealer in that Ac∣count.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>It is certain, that the Jesuits in</HI> Rome <HI>were great with the</HI> Spanish <HI>Ambassa∣dor</HI> Leger <HI>there, and had great recourse unto him, when the Matter was on foot, doth not this then urge them to be Concurrers thereunto?</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>It is likewise most certain, that the</HI> English Jesuits <HI>in</HI> Rome, <HI>appropriated cer∣tain Pallaces in</HI> London <HI>to themselves, to fall unto their Lots (when the Matter was in hand∣ling) to wit,</HI> Burghley-House, Bridewel, <HI>and another, which I have forgot, makeing them∣selves cock sure of their already devoured Prey. This all the Students that lived in the</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg2"><HI>Viz.</HI> The English Col∣ledge at <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Colledge at that time will witness with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, now would I demand of you, what reasons they might have to be their own Carve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if they had not some Interest in that Affair</HI>?</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>We know that they were more forward in</HI> Rome <HI>concerning this Matter, than the Cardinal or any other</HI>; insomuch, <HI>as, at the first News of the</HI> Spaniards <HI>coming down into the narrow Seas, they would have had</HI> Te Deum <HI>sung in the Colledge for joy of Victory, if the Cardinal had not stayed it.</HI></P>
<P>And to conclude, <HI>Doth not the posting of Father</HI> Parsons <HI>into</HI> Spain, <HI>presently after the Overthrow of this Army, for further dealing with the</HI> Spaniard <HI>for the time to come, and his better information in</HI> English <HI>Affairs; and Father</HI> Holt <HI>posting into the</HI> Low-Countries, <HI>for the like Purpose, to keep the</HI> Spaniard <HI>still in hope of future times, that this Mishap might not withdraw him from ever enterprizing the like afterwards, shew, that they were Dealers in the former? Doubtless all these Circumstances cannot but sufficiently prove it, that they were, in the Judgment of wise Men.</HI></P>

Amongst the rest was <HI>Roderigo Lopez</HI> a Jewish Physician, whom the Queen entertained in her own Service, making him Physician to her Houshold; and <HI>Stephano Ferreira de Gama,</HI> with <HI>Emanuel Loisie.</HI> These three were enticed by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to undertake the Murther of the Queen, for which they were promised great rewards, but <HI>Lopez</HI> was to be the main instrument.</P>
<P><HI>Lopez</HI> confessed that of late years he had been allured to do service secretly to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which he did by means of one <HI>Manuel Andrada</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lopez</HI> his Confession.</NOTE> an Agitator under <HI>Don Bernardino Mendoza,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador in <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P N="9">9. That he sent these Letters by one <HI>Gomez Davilla</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI> that the reason why the Murther was not Executed according to promise was, because he perceived the delivery of the 50000 Crowns defer'd, tho promised him from day to day.</P>

<P><PB N="66" REF="44"/>These Plots and Conspiracies against the Queens Person, and for the Extirpating Heresie (as they called the Protestant Religion) moved the Queen to call a Parliament, which she did in the thirty fifth Year of her Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament called to secure the Queens Person and the Protestant Re∣ligion against the Plots and Conspiracies of the Papists.</NOTE> and recommended the preservation of her Person, and the Protestant Religion to them, that they would put her into a posture of defending her self, and these Kingdoms against any further attempts that might be made by the <HI>Pope,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> or any other, which was done by giving her large supplies, and making an additional Act to the many that had been before made against the <HI>Papists</HI>; which is Intituled, an Act for restraining of Popish recusants, to some certain places of abode.

<P>This said, he embraceth him, then throwing his left Arm about <HI>Squires</HI> Neck; so hugging him with his right-hand, he makes the sign of the Cross upon <HI>Squires</HI> Fore∣head; thus Blessing him, <HI>God Bless thee my Son, and strengthen thee, be of good Chear; I will pawn my Soul for thine, and thou shalt always have the benefit of my Prayers; and whither thou livest or dyest, thou shalt enjoy a full pardon and remission of all thy Sns.</HI> And another time thus encourageth him: <HI>There is one thing necessary, which if thou prefer before all other things, and dost fulfil it, I have my desire, and thou shalt be a glorious Saint in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Squire</HI> thus divelishly resolved, gets into <HI>England,</HI> goes to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where the Court then was, watcheth opportunity; and being inform'd that the Queen was to Ride abroad, goeth to her Horse, holdeth him according to his place; and cunningly puts strong Poyson upon the pumel of the Saddle; yet saying with a loud Voice, as she mounted, <HI>God save the Queen.</HI> But such was the providence; that her Majesty, neither in getting up, riding, or going down, once touched the Pumel; yet he doubted not, but that in time it would work the intended ruin, fully persuaded the Queen had laid her hands on it.</P>
<P>Of this Poyson, being great expectation amongst some, and seeing no signs of any such effect, they became incensed against <HI>Squire,</HI> thinking that he had left them and the Cause in the lurch, and meerly deluded them: Thus jealous and enraged, a revenge is resolved on, and <HI>Squire</HI> cunningly accused of some design against the Queen, <HI>Squire,</HI> upon the noise, is Examined, and wondring how any thing should be known against him, yet suspecting <HI>Walpool</HI> his confession, and believing all was fully discovered, free∣ly confesseth all as above is said; so, as a Traytor, is Condemned and Executed. I shall close my account of the History of making the Penal Laws in this Queens Reign, with the words of the secular Priests in their important considerations relating to what the <HI>Papists</HI> did, and writ, from 1588 to the end of her Reign; whereby they justyfie the Queen, and lay blame on the Jesuits.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="45"/>But now we are come to the Year 1588. and to that most Bloody attempt, not only against Her Majesty and our common Enemies, but against our selves, all Catholics:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Secular Priests confess all the matters before related to be true. Collection, <HI>f. 46.</HI></NOTE> Nay, against this flourishing Kingdom and our Native Country. The Memory of which attempt will be (as we trust) an ever-lasting monument of Jesuiti∣cal Treason and Cruelty.</P>
<P>Then reckoning up the Treasons from 1580. to 1590. <Q>Let us consider, say they, how we our selves all this while have been dealt with, such or us as remained in Prison at <HI>Wisbich,</HI> (and were committed thither, 1580. and others not long after commit∣ted also thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collect. <HI>f. 94.</HI></NOTE> to the number of about thirty three or thirty four) continued still in the several times of all the said most wicked designments as we were before, and we were never brought into any trouble for them, but lived there Colledge-like, with∣out any want, and in good reputation with our Neighbours that were Catholics about us. It is true, that towards the number of 50. (as our Memory serveth us) Priests and Catholics of all sorts, within the Compass of the said ten Years were put to Death; we say, upon our knowledges (concerning the most of them) for their Consciences; but our Adversaries (as they think) do still affirm for Treason: Such Priests as in their Examination were found any thing moderate, were not so hardly proceeded with insomuch as 55. (to our remembrance) that by the Laws (we acknowledge) might have been put to Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camb. <HI>saith</HI> 70. <HI>Annals</HI> f. 295.</NOTE> were in one Year, <HI>viz.</HI> 1585. (what time great Mischiefs were in hand) spared from that extremity, and only ba∣nished: which fact, howsoever some have written of it; the Parties themselves ac∣counted it for a great benefit, and so would they also have done (we doubt not of it) if they had been of that number. Whereas therefore Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI> (as we think) exclaimeth in a Pamphlet set out shortly after; saying, <HI>where are now the Old Tyrants of the World</HI>: Nero, Decius, Dioclesian, Maxentius <HI>and the rest of the great Persecutors of the Christians? Where is</HI> Genserick <HI>and</HI> Henricus <HI>with their Arian Hereticks</HI> alluding to the <HI>State.</HI> Here we think both him and divers others that have written to the same effect, very greatly to blame. Sure we are, that the general Cause of Religion, for the which both we and they contend (as oft we have said) getteth no good but hurt by it; and contrary to the Old saying (be he never so bad, yet let him have Justice,) tho some hard Courses have been taken by the <HI>State</HI> against us, yet hath it not by many degrees been so extream as the Jesuits and that Crue have falsely written and reported of it <HI>(nor indeed as they deserved.)</HI></Q></P>
<P>Afterwards they inveigh against the <HI>Spanish Invasion,</HI> against <HI>Parsons</HI> for a Book he writ, and against him and <HI>Creswel,</HI> for another they writ, they go on thus: <Q>Whilst the said Invasion was thus talked of, and in preparation in <HI>Spain,</HI> a shorter course was thought of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heskets <HI>Plot.</HI></NOTE> it might have had success. Mr. <HI>Hesket</HI> was set on by the Jesuits, 1592. or there∣abouts with Father <HI>Parsons</HI> consent or knowledge, to have stirred up the Earl of <HI>Darby</HI> to Rebellion against Her Highness.</Q></P>
<P><Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cullen.</NOTE>Not long after good Father <HI>Holt</HI> and others with him, persuaded an <HI>Irish</HI>-man one <HI>Patrick Collen</HI> (as he himself confessed) to attempt the laying his violent and villanous hands upon Her Majesty. Shortly after in the Year 1593. that Notable Stratagem was Plotted (the whole State knoweth by whom) for Dr. <HI>Lopez</HI> the Queens Physi∣cian to have Poysoned her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lopez.</NOTE> for the which he was Executed the Year after. This wicked designment being thus prevented by Gods providence, the said Traiterous Je∣suit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">York <HI>and</HI> Williams.</NOTE> <HI>Holt</HI> and others did allure and animate one <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Williams,</HI> to have accompli∣shed that with their Bloody hands, that the other purposed to have done with his Poyson; we mean Her Majesties destruction. Hereunto we might add the late Villanous attempt 1599. of <HI>Edward Squire</HI> animated and drawn thereto (as he con∣fessed) by <HI>Wallpool</HI> that pernicious Jesuit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walpool.</NOTE> But we must turn again to Father <HI>Parsons,</HI> whose turnings and doublings are such as would trouble a right good Hound to Trace him. For in the mean time, that the said Traytors one after another, were Plotting and Studying how best they might compass Her Majesties Death; they cared not how nor by what means, he the said <HI>Father Parsons</HI> so prevailed with the King, as he attempted twice in two sundry Years, his new Invasion, meaning to have proceeded therein,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniard</HI> designed a Se∣cond Invasion.</NOTE> not with such great preparation as he did at the first, but only to have begun the same, by taking some Port <HI>Westward.</HI> Towards which he came so far onward as <HI>Silley</HI> with his Fleet. At both which times, God who still hath fought for her Majesty and this Realm; did notably prevent him, by such Winds and Tempests, as the most of his Ships and Men perished in the Sea as they were coming hitherward.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Furthermore, the said good Father in the midst of all the said Trayterous enter∣prizes both at home and abroad, (devised and set forward by him and his Companions)
<PB N="69" REF="45"/>
was ploding amongst his Papers, and playing the herauld; how, if all his said wicked designments failed, he might at the last Intitle the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and consequently the <HI>Infanta</HI> his Daughter to the Crown and Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> To which pur∣pose he framed, and after published a Book,</Q> wherewith he acquainted the Students in those Seminaries in <HI>Spain,</HI> and Laboured nothing more, <HI>then to have their subscrip∣tions to the said</HI> Infanta's <HI>Title, therein promissing unto her their present Allegiance, as unto their lawful Soveraign; and that when they should be sent into their Country, they should per∣swade the Catholics there to do the like, without any further Expectation of the Queen of</HI> Englands <HI>Death.</HI> <Q>As Mr. <HI>Charles Paget</HI> affirmeth in his Book against <HI>Parsons.</HI></Q></P>
<P>They confess in these words: <Q>That the Jesuitical designments beyond the Seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collect. <HI>53, 54.</HI></NOTE> together with certain Rebellions and Traiterous attempts of some Catholics at home, have been the cause of such Calamities and troubles as have happened to us far less (we think) then any Prince living in Her Majesties Case, and so provoked, would have inflicted upon us. And after they tell us, <HI>that divers of their Communion have owned so much.</HI> I shall conclude this Reign with these words of theirs which fully justifie the making the Laws that were made in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are fully persuaded in our Consciences; and as Men, besides our Learning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Collect.</HI> 55, 56 57.</NOTE> who have some experience, that if the Catholics had never sought, by indirect means, to have vexed Her Majesty with their designments against her Crown; if the Pope and King of <HI>Spain</HI> had never plotted with the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>: If the Rebels in the <HI>North,</HI> had never been heard of; if the <HI>Bull</HI> of <HI>Pius</HI> the V. had never been known; if the said Rebellion had never been justified: If neither <HI>Steukly</HI> nor the <HI>Pope</HI> had attempted any thing against <HI>Ireland,</HI> if <HI>Gregory</HI> the Thirteenth had not renew∣ed the said Excommunication, if the Jesuits had never come into <HI>England,</HI> if the <HI>Pope</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had not practised with the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> for his attempt against Her Majesty, if <HI>Parsons</HI> and the rest of the Jesuits, with other our Country∣men beyond Seas, had never been agents in these Traiterous and Bloody designments of <HI>Throckmorton, Parry, Collen, York, Willians, Squire</HI> and such like, if they had not by their Treatises and writings endeavoured to defame their Soveraign and their own Country, labouring to have many of their Books Translated into divers Lan∣guages, thereby to shew more their own disloyalty: if Cardinal <HI>Allen</HI> and <HI>Parsons</HI> had not published the Renovation of the said <HI>Bull</HI> by <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI>; if thereunto they had not added their scurrillous and unmanly Admonition, or rather most Prophane Libel against Her Majesty; if they had not sought by false persuasions, and ungod∣ly Arguments to have allured the Hearts of Catholics from their Allegiance, if the <HI>Pope</HI> had never been urged by them to have thrust the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> into that Barbarous Action against the Realm, if they themselves with the rest of that gene∣ration, had not laboured greatly with the said King for the Conquest and Invasion of this Land by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who are known to be the cruelest Tyrants that live up∣on the Earth: If in all their Proceedings, they had not from time to time depraved, irritated and provoked both Her Majesty and the State, with these and other such like their ungodly and unchristian practices: But on the contrary, if the <HI>Popes</HI> from time to time had sought her Majesty, by kind Offices and gentle Persuasions, never ceasing the prosecution of those and such-like courses of humanity and gentleness, if the Catholics and Priests beyond the Seas had laboured continually the furtherance of those most Priest-like and Divine allurements, and had framed their own proceed∣ings in all their words and writings accordingly, if we at home, all of us, both Priests and People, had possest our Souls in meekness and humility, honoured Her Majesty, born with the infirmity of the <HI>State,</HI> suffered all things, and dealt as true Catholic Priests: If all of us (we say) had thus done, most assuredly the State would have loved us, or at least born with us; where there is one Catholic, there would have been ten: There had been no Speeches amongst us, of Racks and Tortures, nor any cause to have used them; for none were ever vexed that way simply, for that he was either Priest or Catholic, but because they were suspected to have had their hands in some of the said most Traiterous designments: None of Her Majesties Enemies durst so really have attempted her State and Kingdom; we had been in better friend∣ship with those that seek now most to oppose themselves against us, and to all Men (as we are persuaded.) <HI>Bonus odor Christi odor vitae ad vitam.</HI> Whereas by following the said new violent Spirits, <HI>quasi turbae impellentes parietem,</HI> we are become, <HI>odor Mortis ad mortem, non solum iis qui pereunt, sed etiam iis qui salvi fiunt.</HI> And there∣fore let us all turn over the Leaf, and take another course, then hitherto we have done.</Q></P>

<PB N="71" REF="47"/>
were on foot, against the said King <HI>James</HI> his Life, before his accession to the Crown.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> being old and weak (and as they thought,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papists plot against <HI>James</HI> the First, before his coming to the Crown.</NOTE> could not live long) the Papists thought it needless to make any more attempts against her person, least her death should anticipate their quickest Designs: But she and the Kingdom having their Eye upon the said King <HI>James,</HI> being a Protestant, to succeed her, their main drift was to prevent him, if possible, from succeeding Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>In order to this in the Year 1601. there was one <HI>Francis Mowbray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Mowbray's</HI> Plot against King <HI>James</HI> the First.</P><P><HI>Fowlis</HI> Hist. li. <HI>10.</HI> cap. <HI>1.</HI> f. <HI>498.</HI></P></NOTE> Son to the Laird <HI>Barnbowegal,</HI> who had lived some while in the <HI>Infanta's</HI> Court at <HI>Brussels,</HI> he they say undertook to take this <HI>rub</HI> out of the way, by killing the King, to which purpose he went for <HI>Scotland,</HI> but took <HI>England</HI> in his way. At <HI>London</HI> one <HI>Daniel</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Fencing Master, discovers the Plot to the Queen; she seized them, and sent them into <HI>Scotland: Mowbray</HI> supposed Guilty, is cast into <HI>Edenburgh</HI> Castle; whence thinking one Night to escape out of a Window by his Bed sheets, they proved too short, and he fell upon the Rocks and so dyed, his Body was hanged for sometime, then quartered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1601.</NOTE> and set upon the Gates, and several places of the City.</P>
<P>This Design failing, another is in hand in <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A design to poy∣son King <HI>James</HI> the First.</NOTE> <HI>Ferdinando</HI> I. the Grand Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> by the intercepting some Letters, discovereth a Plot to poyson the said King <HI>James.</HI> The Duke, by what reasons induced, is not material, but 'tis conjectured, in hopes to convert him, (<HI>rather pervert him</HI>) to the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, resolved to disco∣ver and prevent it. At this time one Mr. <HI>Henry Wotton</HI> sojourned in <HI>Florence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1602.</NOTE> and was well acquainted with Seigniour <HI>Vietta,</HI> the Dukes Secretary; upon whose Commenda∣tions <HI>Wotton</HI> is pitched on to be the Messenger.

<P>As the Popes are never without Designs for promoting some of their Nephews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope de∣signs to exclude King <HI>James</HI> the First.</NOTE> so <HI>Clement</HI> the VIII. the then Pope, in these Designs against the said King <HI>James</HI> his succeeding Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was not wanting, intending the Crown of <HI>England</HI> for some of his friends, and perceiving that some in <HI>England (English</HI> Papists to be sure) were tampering to promote the Interest of the Lady <HI>Arabella,</HI> in this case he thought it best to deal warily; he was very desirous that the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> should wear the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> but finding that this was not feasible, by reason <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Interest was too strong for him, he steers another course, and thinks of Cardinal <HI>Farnese,</HI> who being unmarried, might take to Wife <HI>Arabella,</HI> and so unite Forces and Interests to carry the Crown. To carry on this design, it was advised that all the <HI>Romanists</HI> in <HI>England</HI> should unite, that their Cause might not suffer by any dissentions about this Succession amongst themselves (<HI>a good Caution may hence be given to all Protestants in</HI> England, <HI>that they do not divide upon their present Majesty</HI>'s <HI>King</HI> William <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary's <HI>accession to the Crown</HI>; (who under God) <HI>are the preservers of the Protestant Religion amongst us</HI>; for <HI>vis unita fortior</HI>; and nothing but division can hurt us) to promote this union the <HI>Romish</HI> Clergy, who then had and still have a great awe and authority over the Layety, were exhorted by the Pope to be all of a Mind, as to this Succession, and to press it home upon the Layety, that so the Layety might not be divided. To which purpose it was concluded, that there should be an Arch Priest, who should have a Jurisdiction over the rest, who are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it according to his Rules and Directions, and in these designs Father <HI>Parsons</HI> (who was not yet advanc'd according to his merit) was a main stickler and contri∣ver, the Pope also had drawn up some Bulls, and sent to his <HI>Nuncio</HI> in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> to Divulge and spread them abroad at convenient times, wherein he declared, that not any, though never so near in blood, should after Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> death be admitted to the Crown, but such an one as would not only tollerate the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, but would swear to promote and resettle it; and that in the mean time, Cardinal <HI>Farnese</HI> might, in this Island, have the greatest vogue, the Pope made him Protector of <HI>England</HI> (<HI>as Pope</HI> Pius V. <HI>had before made</HI> Mary <HI>Queen of</HI> Scots, <HI>Queen of</HI> England <HI>to carry on the same design</HI>) as he was of other Countrys; Nay rather then fail, the same Pope had for∣merly exhorted the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> to unite, invade <HI>England</HI> and divide it be∣tween

<P>This Proclamation I thought fit to insert, because by it, it appears that King <HI>James</HI> himself was of opinion; that the before mentioned Conspiracy was conceived by the <HI>Popish</HI> Priests, however they prevailed upon some of the Protestant Profession to joyn with them in Midwiving it into the World, and therefore may truly be called <HI>Popish.</HI></P>
<P>By the Kings issuing out this Proclamation, the heat and hopes of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and their Correspondents were somewhat allayed, but it made way for more dark and se∣cret Contrivances, which they afterwards put into Practice, and I shall give a full Ac∣count of. But before I do that, I shall give you King <HI>James</HI> the First his Opinion of the <HI>Papists,</HI> both <HI>Laicks</HI> and <HI>Clericks,</HI> as he himself delivered it in his first Speech to his first Parliament in 1603. Take it in his own Words as related by <HI>Wilson.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> his Speech a∣gainst Papists <HI>Wilson</HI> f. <HI>19.</HI></NOTE><Q>For the <HI>Papists,</HI> I must put a difference betwixt my own private Profession of my Salvation, and my politick Government of the Realm for the weal and quietness thereof. As for my own Profession, you have me your Head now among You, of the same Religion that the Body is of, as I am no stranger to you in Blood, no more am I a stranger to you in Faith, or in Matters concerning the House of God. And altho' this my Profession be according to my Education, wherein (I thank God,) I suckt the Milk of Gods truth, with the Milk of my Nurse, yet I do here protest unto you, that I would never (for such a Conceit of Constancy, or other prejudi∣cate Opinion) have so firmly kept my first Profession, if I had not found it agreea∣ble to all Reason, and to the Rule of my Conscience: But I was never violent, nor unreasonable in my Profession; I acknowledge the <HI>Roman</HI> Church to be our Mother Church; altho defiled with some Infirmities and Corruptions, as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, before they Crucified Christ. And as I am no Enemy to the Life of a sick Man, because I would have his Body purged of ill Humours; no more am I an Enemy to their Church, because I would have them reform their Errors, not wishing the down-throwing of the Temple, but that it might be purged and cleaned from Corruption: Otherwise how can they wish us to enter, if their House be not first made clean? But as I would be lother to dispense in the least point of mine own Conscience, for any Worldly respect, then the foolishest Precisian of them all: So would I be as sorry to streighten the politick Government of the Bodies and Minds of all my Sub∣jects to my private Opinions: Nay, my Mind was ever so free from Persecution, or inthralling of my Subjects in Matters of Conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> his Mildness to Papists.</NOTE> as I hope those of that Pro∣fession within this Kingdom have a proof since my Coming, that I was so far from increasing their Burthens with <HI>Rhehoboam,</HI> as I have so much as either time, occasion or Law could permit, lightned them. And even now at this time, have I been careful to revise and consider deeply upon the Laws made against them, that some Overture might be made to the present Parliament, for clearing these Laws, by reason, (which is the Soul of the Law) in Case they have been in times past, further, or more rigorously extended by Judges, then the meaning of the Law was, or might tend to the hurt as well of the innocent, as of the guilty Persons. And as to the Persons of my Subjects which are of that Pro∣fession, I must divide them into two ranks <HI>Clericks</HI> and <HI>Laicks,</HI> for the <HI>Laicks</HI> I ever thought them far more excuseable then the other sort, because their Religion containeth such an ignorant, doubtful and implicite kind of Faith grounded upon their Church, that except they do generally believe whatsoever their Teachers please to affirm, they cannot be thought guilty of these particular points of Heresies, and Corruptions, which their Teachers so wilfully profess. And again I must subdivide the <HI>Laick</HI> into two Ranks, which are either quiet and well minded Men, peaceable Sub∣jects, who either being old, retain their first Drunk in Liquor, upon a certain Shame∣facedness to be thought Curious, or Changeable: Or being young Men through evil Education, have been Nursed and brought up upon such Venome, instead of whol∣some Nutriment; and this sort of People I would be sorry to punish their Bodies for
<PB N="75" REF="49"/>
the Error of their Minds, the Reformation whereof must only come of God, and the true Spirit. But the other Rank of <HI>Laicks,</HI> who either through Curiosity, Affecta∣tion of Novelty, or Discontentment, have changed their Coats, only to be Factious, stirers of Sedition, and perturbers of the Common-wealth, this giveth a ground to me (the Magistrate) to take better heed to their Proceedings, and to correct their Ob∣stinacy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But for the <HI>Clericks,</HI> I must directly say and affirm, that as long as they maintain one special point of their Doctrine, and another of their Practise, they are no way sufferable to remain in this Kingdom, the point of Doctrine is, that Arrogant and Ambitious Supremacy of their Head the Pope, whereby he not only Claims to be spiritual Head of all <HI>Christians,</HI> but also to have an <HI>Emperial</HI> Civil power over all Kings and Emperors, Dethroning and Crowning Princes with his Foot as pleaseth him, and dispensing and disposing of all Kingdoms and Empires at his Appetite. The other point which they observe, in continual Practise, is the Assassinates and Murthers of Kings: Thinking it no sin, but rather a Matter of Salvation, to do all Acts of Rebellion, and Hostility against their natural Sovereign Lord, if he be once Cursed, his Subjects discharged▪ of their Fidelity, and his Kingdom given a prey, by that three Crowned <HI>Monarch,</HI> or rather <HI>Monster</HI> their Head. And in this point I have no occasion to speak further here, saving that I could wish from my Heart, It would please God to make me one of the Members of such a general Christian Uni∣on in Religion, as (laying Wilfulness aside on both hands) we might meet in the midst, which is the Center, and perfection of all things. For if they would leave and be ashamed of such new and gross Corruptions of theirs, as themselves cannot maintain, nor deny to be worthy of Reformation, I would for my own part be con∣tent to meet them in the mid way, so that all Novelties might be renounced on either side: For as my Faith is the true Ancient and Apostolick Faith, grounded upon the express word of God; so will I ever yeild all reverence to <HI>Antiquity,</HI> in the points of <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Policy: And by that means shall I ever, with Gods Grace, keep my self from either being an <HI>Heretick</HI> in Faith, or <HI>Shismatick</HI> in Matters of Policy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But of one thing would I have the <HI>Papists</HI> of this Land to be admonished, that they presume not so much upon my Lenity (because I would be loath to be thought a Persecutor) as thereupon to think it lawful for them, daily to encrease their num∣ber and strength in this Kingdom; whereby if not in my time, at least in the time of my Posterity, they may be in hope to erect their Religion again. No,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As they were very lately.</NOTE> let them assure themselves, that as I am a Friend to their Persons, if they be good Subjects; so am I a vowed <HI>Enemy,</HI> and do denounce Mortal War to their Errors; And as I would be sorry to be driven, by their ill Behaviour, from the Protection and Con∣servation of their Bodies and Lives; so I will never cease, as far as I can,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suffering the increase of Po∣pery called by <HI>Jam. 1.</HI> a be∣traying <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></NOTE> to tread down their Errors, and wrong Opinions. For I could not permit the increase and growing of their Religion, without betraying my self, and my own Conscience, and this whole <HI>Island,</HI> as well the part I am come from, as the part I remain in, in be∣traying their Liberties, and reducing them to the former slavish Yoke, which both had cast off before I came among them, as also the Liberty of the Crown in my Po∣sterity, which I should leave again under a new Slavery, being left free to me by my Predecessors. And therefore I would wish all good Subjects, that are deceived with this Corruption, if they find any beginnings in themselves, of Knowledge, and Love to the truth, to foster the same by all lawful Means, and to beware of quench∣ing the Spirit that worketh within them. And if they can find as yet no Motion tending that way, to be studious to read and confer with Learned men, and to use all such means as may further their resolutions; assuring them, that as long as they are disconformable in Religion to us, they cannot be but half my Subjects, be able to do but half service, and I shall want the best half of them, which is their Souls.</Q> After which, the Parliament considering the said Proclamation and Speech, and that notwithstanding, the Jesuites, and Seminary Priests flockt over in great numbers into <HI>England,</HI> made an Act of Parliament; intituled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Jac. cap. 4.

<P>To carry on this Design when it was laid, first an Oath of <HI>Secrecy</HI> was compiled, and afterwards the Conspirators took the same, and not only so, but <HI>Garnet</HI> confest them, and they afterwards received the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> to bind them to the greater Se∣crecy; the Oath was this.</P>

<P>And think not slightly of this Advertisment, but retire your self into your Country, where you may expect the Event in Safety; for though there be no Appearance of any stir, yet, I say, they shall receive a terrible Blow this Parliament, and yet they not see who hurts them.</P>
<P>This Councel is not to be contemned, because it may do you good, and can do you no harm, for the Danger is past, as soon as you have burned this Letter, and I hope God will give you the Grace to make good use of it; to whose Holy Protection I commend you.</P>

<P><PB N="78" REF="51"/><HI>Monteagle</HI> wondred at the Letter and its Delivery, and thinking it might relate to some Mischief, thought it his Duty to make it known; so away he goeth to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> shows it to the Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> then Secretary of State, who tells some other of the Privy Council of it, and the King being returned from his Hunting at <HI>Royston,</HI> they de∣livered it to him.</P>
<P>His Majesty having seriously considered it, and all other Circumstances, concluded, that it might relate to some Design to blow up the Parliament; and in this Jealousie, or∣dered the Rooms and Vaults about the House to be searched, which was done the Night before the Session, when in the aforesaid Cellar, under the Lords House, were found the Barrels of Powder, and at the Door, standing <HI>Guido Faux</HI> booted and Spur∣red, with a large dark Lanthorn (now to be seen in <HI>Oxford</HI> Library) with Matches, Tinder-Box, and other Materials for his Design.</P>
<P><HI>Faux</HI> was presently carried to Court and examined, where he appeared sturdy and scornful, maintaining the Design to be lawful; that <HI>James</HI> was not his King, because an Heretic; was sorry that the Plot failed, and that he had not blown up the House, with himself and those that were sent to search; affirming, that God would have had the Plot concealed, but it was the Devil who revealed it; at last, <HI>Faux</HI> himself confest all that he knew of the Treasons. Thus far discovered, the King suspecting some Commotions or Risings, sent with all speed to prevent them by timely Notice, by <HI>Lep∣ton</HI> and others. This was that Mr. <HI>John Lepton</HI> of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> who rid so often betwixt <HI>London</HI> and <HI>York</HI> in one Week, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>May</HI> 1606, who though he won his Wager, yet was a Looser, never getting his Winnings.</P>

<P>On the 27<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>January</HI> 1605. were arraigned upon one Indictment, <HI>Robert Win∣ter</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Thomas Winter</HI> Gent. <HI>Guy Fawks</HI> Gent. <HI>John Garnet</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Ambrose Rookwood</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Robert Keys</HI> Gent. and <HI>Thomas Bates</HI>; upon another Indictment, Sir <HI>Everard Digby.</HI> At the Tryal of <HI>Winter</HI> and the rest, upon the first Indictment, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Heads of the Speech of Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> at the Tryal of some of the Conspi∣rators.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> than Attorney General, made a very long and learned Speech, wherein he first answered the Clamor that the <HI>Papists</HI> and their Adherents had then made, because they were not sooner tryed. Then he opened the Hainousness of the Crime in all the Ag∣gravating Circumstances of it. He said, that as the <HI>Powder-Treason</HI> was of its self prodigi∣ous and unnatural, so was it in its Conception and Birth most monstrous, as arising out of the dead Ashes of former Treasons; and then takes notice of very many, if not all the Treasons before mentioned; I think in this Speech, and the Speech he made at <HI>Garnets</HI> Tryal, all, I am sure the most, are taken in. He then considered the <HI>Powder-Plot</HI> it self, with regard to the Persons by whom the same was conspired: And they were <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion. The Laity, Gentlemen of good Houses, of excellent Parts, however most perniciously seduced, abused, cor∣rupted and <HI>Jesuited,</HI> of very competent Fortunes and Estates. It being then said, that there was never a <HI>Religious</HI> Man in the Action; saith he, in answer, I never yet knew a Treason without a <HI>Romish</HI> Priest, and names, as ingaged in this, <HI>Henry Garnet,</HI> alias <HI>Wally,</HI> the Superior of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> Legier here in <HI>England</HI>; Father <HI>Creswel,</HI> Legier Jesuit in <HI>Spain</HI>; Father <HI>Baldwin,</HI> Legier in <HI>Flanders,</HI> as <HI>Parsons</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> be∣sides their Cursory Men, as <HI>Gerrard, Oswald, Tesmond,</HI> alias <HI>Greenway, Hamond</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI>; then he opened the Doctrines and Practices of the Jesuits and o∣ther Priests of the Romish Church, which he proves from <HI>Simanca, Creswels, Phi∣lopater</HI> and other Books. Then he considered the Persons against whom this Treason
<PB N="79" REF="51"/>
was conspired; the King, the Queen, the Royal Issue Male, the most honourable and prudent Councellors, and all the true hearted and worthy Nobles, all the Reverend and Learned Bishops, all the Grave Judges, and Sages of the Law, all the principal Knights, Citizens and Burgeesss of Parliament, the Flower of the whole Realm. Then he considered, that this was designed, notwithstanding the King had used so great Le∣nity toward the <HI>Papists,</HI> that by the space of a whole Year and four Months, he took no Penalties of them due upon the Statutes; and besides this, divers of the Papists were greatly preferred. Then he considered the House of Parliament, which they pretended they chose, because there the Penal Laws were made against them; which he answered, by briefly showing what Laws were made against them, and that their own Treasons were the true Grounds of making them. Then he considered the End of this Conspiracy, which was to bring a final and fatal Confusion upon the State, and this is to be effected by damnable Means, by mineing, by thirty six Barrels of Powder, having Crows of Iron, Stone and Wood laid upon the Barrels, to have made the Breach the greater. Then he considered the Secresie of the Contrivance and Car∣riage of this Treason, in three Respects; the first, that <HI>Catesby</HI> had Recommendation for a Regiment of Horse in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> that under that Pretence, he might furnish this Treason with Horse without Suspicion. The Second was, the Oath be∣fore mentioned. The Third, the Sacrament. He then took notice of the admirable Discovery of this Treason, and proceeded to make nine several Observations upon the whole, which were these: First, The Mine had never been discovered, had not the Cellar been hired. 2. The Kings Directing the Search to be made there, from those dark Words, <HI>A Terrible Blow.</HI> 3. <HI>Catesby, Rookwood</HI> and <HI>Grants,</HI> their narrow Escapes, having a few Days before they were taken, been in very great Danger of being blown up by Gun-powder. 4. Gun-powder was the Invention of a <HI>Fryar.</HI> 5. <HI>Binham</HI> was sent to the Pope, to give notice of this Blow, and to crave his Directi∣on and Aid. 6. Notwithstanding their rising in open Rebellion, and giving out, that the <HI>Catholics</HI> Throats would be cut, not one Man came in to take their Parts, but their own Company. 7. The Sheriff immediately supprest them. 8. The Discove∣ry was made a few hours before it was to have been put in Execution. 9. That there never was any <HI>Protestant Minister</HI> in any Treason and Murther that had been then attempted within the Realm. Then he compared this Plot with that of <HI>Raleigh</HI> and <HI>Watson</HI> and <HI>Clark.</HI> 1. They had both one end. 2. Both to be effected by <HI>Po∣pish</HI> and discontented Persons, <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Laymen.</HI> 3. They all played at Hazzard, the <HI>Priests</HI> were at the By, <HI>Raleigh</HI> at the Main, but these in at all, purposing to de∣stroy King, Issue, whole State. 4. All obliged by the same Oath and Sacrament. 5. The same Proclamation (after the Fact) for Reformation of Abuses. 6. The like Army provided for Invading. 7. The same Pension of Crows promised. 8. The Agreeing of the Times, which was when the Constable of <HI>Spain</HI> was coming hi∣ther, which was intended a Colour to the <HI>Invasion,</HI> that it might not be sus∣pected.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> had ended his Speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Evidence against the Traitors.</NOTE> the Examinations of <HI>Winter</HI> and the rest, subscribed by themselves, were shown particularly to every one of them, and acknowledged by them to be their own, and true; and in their Examinations, every one had confest the Treason, which Confessions were afterwards openly and distinctly read; by which it appeared, that <HI>Bates</HI> was resolved for what he undertook in this Pow∣der-Treason, being therein warranted by the <HI>Jesuits.</HI> Also that <HI>Hamond</HI> the Jesuite, the 7<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> after the Discovery, confest and absolved them. The Confessions of <HI>Watson</HI> and <HI>Clark,</HI> Seminary Priests, upon their Apprehension, was also taken no∣tice of, who affirmed, that there was some Treason intended by the Jesuits, and then in hand.</P>
<P>After the reading their several Examinations, Confessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Con∣viction, Con∣demnation, and Execution.</NOTE> and voluntary Declarati∣ons, as well of themselves, as of some of their dead Confederates, they were all found guilty, and having nothing to say for themselves, were comdemned and exe∣cuted.</P>

He was a grand Agitator in this Plot, and did himself at last confess thus much, That <HI>Catesby</HI> had told him of the Plot, but not by way of Confession; that <HI>Greenwel</HI> had told him of this, not as a Fault (<HI>for how could they do so, that approved it as meritorious</HI>) but as a thing that he had Intelligence of, and told it him by way of Consultation; that <HI>Catesby</HI> and <HI>Greenwel</HI> came together to him to be resolved; that <HI>Tesmond</HI> and he had Conference of the Particulars of the Powder-Treason in <HI>Essex</HI>; that <HI>Greenwel</HI> asked him who should be Protector? <HI>Garnet</HI> said, that was to be deferred till the Blow was past; that he ought to have revealed it to the King; that nothing deterred him from the Discovery so much, as his Unwillingness to betray <HI>Catesby</HI>; that he had greatly sin∣ned against God, the King and the Kingdom, in not revealing it, of whom he heartily begged Pardon and Forgiveness.</P>

First of all, the rest of the Confederates have accused me.</HI> Secondly, Catesby <HI>always made use of my Authority amongst them, whereby most of them were perswaded to have a good Opinion of the Enterprize; so that all knew I was in it.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>two</HI> (set on purpose) <HI>heard me discourse the whole business with</HI> Oldcorn, <HI>and tell him how I thought to answer all Objections.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>My Letters writ with the Juice of Orange to Mrs.</HI> Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne Vaux.</NOTE> <HI>are (I know not how) fallen into their Hands, whereby I plainly enough discovered my Knowledge of it.</HI> Whence I gather, that the Jesuits did sufficiently tamper with him to conceal his Guilt, and that he would have concealed it if he could; and all that have writ in Justification of him, are sufficiently answered by his own Con∣fession; and the four Reasons above mentioned, that induced him thereunto, to which add his further Confession—<HI>That he had often vowed, both by Words and Writings, to the Lay Conspirators, that he would never discover or betray any of them</HI>; and his acknow∣ledging his Offence, wishing <HI>it were in his Power to undo that which was done,</HI> and <HI>that if the whole World were his, he would willingly give it to quit himself from the Guilt of Treason, which now troubled his Conscience.</HI> Moreover, he himself owned in a Letter to Mrs <HI>Anne Vaux, That he was sorry he could not die for Religion, but for Treasons.</HI> These Instances are, certainly, sufficient to convince any unbyassed Reader; but to put the Matter out of doubt and (if it be possible) to convince even the <HI>Papists. Thuanus</HI> himself, one of their <HI>own Communion,</HI> Privy-Councellor to the <HI>French</HI> King, and <HI>President</HI> of the Supream <HI>Senate</HI> of that Kingdom, was so fully convinced of the Truth of this Conspiracy, and that all the Conspirators before named were ingaged in it, that he writ a most ingenu∣ous Narrative of the whole in Latin, which was in the year 1674. faithfully rendred into English, and printed; where the Papists that do not understand Latine, may, if they please, receive ample Satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="52"/>So detestable, it seems, this Conspiracy was to some of the <HI>English</HI> Colledge at <HI>Rome,</HI> that being informed of the Discovery of this Plot, sixteen of them (abhorring such jugling and bloody Designs) forsook the Colledge, slipt into <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Translation of <HI>Thuanus, f. 1.</HI></NOTE> and thence some of them came into <HI>England</HI> and turned Protestants. But nothing will convince some Papists, for notwithstanding all the Confessions aforesaid, and Convictions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Foulis</HI> Hist. l. 10. cap. 2. f. 510.</NOTE> and Executions upon those Confessions, there are not a few, who would perswade the World to believe, that all this was but a mear Cheat, a Trick of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the then Secretary. And <HI>Foulis</HI> saith, he once heard a Story very gravely told, that one lurking under the Council-Table, concealed by the long Carper, heard much of the Contri∣vance; a Tale so absurd and ridiculous, that after what hath been already said, to en∣deavour to confute it, would argue more impertinence then they were guilty of, who broached the Story.</P>
<P>This Conspiracy being discovered in so wonderful a manner, and the Deliverance attended with so many amazing Circumstances, the Parliament took the same into their Consideration, and in the first place, made a Law for keeping an Anniversary Day of Thanks-giving on the <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> and enacted the same Law should be read in the Churches publickly upon the same Day, and then made an Act for the Attainder of the Offenders. Which Acts of Parliament, because they yet strength∣en and confirm the Truth of the said Conspiracy (and that they do so, must be con∣fest, unless Men will fly in the Face of that Parliament.)

If God of his infinite Mercy had not most Miraculously by your Majesties blessed direction Discovered the same, in finding out the said Barrels of <HI>Gun-Powder</HI> in the said Vault or Cellar, but few hours before the time appointed for the Execution thereof: All which most Heinous, Horrid and Damnable Treasons, are most manifest and apparent by the volunta∣ry confession and acknowledgments of the Offenders themselves: Of which most Barbarous, Bloody and detestable Treason, for Conspiring and preparing to blow up the Parliament-House with <HI>Gun-Powder,</HI> The said <HI>Robert Winter, Thomas Winter, Guy Fauks, Robert Keyes, Ambrose Rookwood, John Graunt</HI> and <HI>Thomas Bates</HI> have been lately indicted, and during this present Sessions of Parliament Arraigned, convicted by Verdict and thereupon attainted.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VVHereas the late unapproveable and must wicked design,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papists threatning Let∣ter to the Earl of <HI>Salibury, Foulis</HI> Hist. <HI>l. 10. c. 3. f. 521.</HI></NOTE> for destroying of his Majesty, the Prince and Nobility, with many other of worth and qua∣lity (attempted through the undertaking Spirits of some more fiery and turbulent, then Zealous and dispassionate Catholics) hath made the general State of our Ca∣tholic Cause, so scandalous in the Eye of such, whose corrupted Judgments are not able to fan away and sever the fault of the Professor, from the profession its self as that who now is found to be of that Religion, is persuaded at least in mind, to allow (tho God knoweth as much abhoring as any <HI>Puritan</HI> whatsoever) the said former most inhumane and Barbarous project.</P>
<P>And, whereas some of His Majesties Councel (but especially your Lordship, as be∣ing known to be, as the <HI>Philosopher</HI> termeth it, a <HI>Primus Motor</HI> in such uncharitable proceedings) are determined (as it is feared) by taking advantage of so foul a scandal, to root out all the Memory of Catholic Religion, either by suddain Banishment, Mas∣sacre, Imprisonment, or some such unsupportable vexations and pressures; and per∣haps by decreeing in this next Parliament, some more cruel and horrible Laws against Catholics, then already are made.</P>
<P>In regard of the premises, there are some <HI>good Men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Good men and <HI>Roman</HI> Ca∣tholics,</NOTE> who through their earnest desire for the continuing the Catholic Religion, and for saving many Souls both of this present, and of all future posterity, are resolved to prevent so great a mischief, tho with a full assurance aforehand of the loss of their dearest Lives.</P>
<P>You are therefore hereby to be admonished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May Murther Privy Coun∣cillors.</NOTE> that at this present there are <HI>Five</HI> who have severally undertaken your <HI>Death,</HI> and have vowed the performance thereof, by taking already the <HI>Blessed Sacrament,</HI> if you continue your daily Plotting of so Tra∣gical Stratagems against Recusants.</P>
<P>It is ordered, that none of these <HI>Five</HI> knoweth who the other <HI>Four</HI> be; for the better preventing the discovery of the rest, if so any one by attempting, and not performing, should be apprehended.</P>
<P>It is also already agreed who shall first attempt it by shot, and so, who in order shall follow.</P>
<P>In accomplishing of it there is expected no other than assurance of Death; yet it will willingly be embraced, for the preventing of those general Calamities, which by this your transcendent Authority and Grace with His Majesty, are threatned unto us.</P>
<P>And indeed the difficulties herein are more easily to be digested, since <HI>Two</HI> of the intended attempters, are in that <HI>weak</HI> estate of Body, that they cannot live above three or four Months.</P>
<P>The other <HI>Three</HI> are so distressed in themselves and their Friends, as that their present griefs (for being only Recusants) do much dull all aprehensions of Death.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter at the beginning affords fair, seeming to detest the Gun-Powder-Plot, (as <HI>Watson</HI> did the Popish Treasons in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, and was hanged for Treason in the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>James</HI>) but little credit is to be given to what they say, if it be considered, that the very design of it is to apoligize for <HI>Murther</HI>; and that they therein assert, that although they Murther <HI>Privy Counsellors</HI>; yet the Mur∣therers may be <HI>good men,</HI> nor are they to be blamed for it, for it is a true and spi∣ritual resolution. What influence this Letter had the sequel will evince, for the said Oath was immediately confirmed by Act of Parliament, and the Papists injoyned to take it, in the Circumstances, and upon the Penalties in the Act for that purpose mentioned: the sum and substance of which Act followeth; it is Intitled, <HI>An Act for the better discovering and repressing of Popish Recusants.</HI> The Preamble of the Act runs thus.</P>
<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3. Jac. 1. c. 4. Rast,</HI> Stat. f. <HI>591.</HI> Papists must receive the Sacrament and take the Oath of Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon pecuniary mulcts if neg∣lected.</NOTE><HI>FOrasmuch as it is found by daily Experience, that many His Majesties Subjects, that adhere in their hearts to the Popish Religion, by the infection drawn from thence, and by the Wicked and Divelish Councel of Iesuits, Seminaries, and other like Persons, dangerous to the Church and State, are so far perverted in the point of their Loyalty and due Allegiance to the Kings Majesty, and the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>as they are ready to entertain and Execute any Treasonable Conspiracies and Practices, as evidently appears by that more then barbarous and horrible Attempt to have blown up with Gun-powder, the King, Queen, Prince, Lords and Commons in the House of Parliament Assembled, tending to the utter Subversion of the whole State, lately undertaken by the instigation of Iesuits and Seminaries, and in Advancement of their Religion, by their Schollars Taught and Instructed by them to that purpose, which Attempt by the only goodness of Almighty God, was discovered and defeated: And where divers Persons Popishly affected, do neverthe∣less, the better to cover and hide their false Hearts, and with the more safety to at∣tend the opportunity to execute their mischievous Designs, repair sometimes to Church to escape the Penalty of the Laws in that behalf provided.</HI></P>
<P>Then, <HI>for the better discovery of such Persons and their Evil affections to the Kings Majesty and to the State of the Realm, to the end that being known their Evil Purposes might be the better prevented.</HI> It was enacted, <HI>that every Papist that Conforms shall Yearly receive the Sacrament, upon twenty pounds Forfeiture upon the first Years neglect, forty pounds the second, sixty pounds the third, and so
<PB N="87" REF="55"/>
forwards, sixty pounds Yearly, until he or she shall have received it. That Pa∣pists, their Children of Nine Years, and Servants, shall be once a Year presented at the general or Quarter Sessions; Which presentments are to be recorded at the Sessions. That the Iustices of Assize and Goal Delivery, and Iustices of Peace shall hear and determine the Offence. That Proclamation shall be made at the Assizes or Sessions, for the Offender to render his body to the Sheriff, Bayliff or Keeper of the Goal of the Liberty before the next Assizes or Sessions,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And if the Offender doth not, he stands Convicted; and forfeits twenty pounds a Month for every Month contained in the Indictment whereon he his Convicted. That every Conviction shall be certified into the</HI> Exchequer, <HI>that the King may refuse twenty pounds a Month and take two parts of the Papists Lands, save their Man∣sion House. That the Kings two parts shall not be Leased to Papists.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Noblemen and Noblewomen are excepted.</NOTE> <HI>That the Oath of Allegiance, shall be tendred to all Persons of the Age of Eighteen Years or above Convicted or Indicted for Recusancy, for not going to Church, for not receiving the Sacrament, or that pass through any Country, Shire or Liberty, and unknown.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Who refuse taking this Oath incur a Premunire except Women covert, who are to be Committed to the Common Goal, without Bail or Mainprize, till they take the Oath. No Indictment or other Proceedings against the Papists shall be discharged or reversed for default of Form, but Conformity discharges all Pro∣ceedings whatever. Felony in any that go beyond Seas to serve any Forreign Prince,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>or being there shall voluntarily serve such Prince, not first having taken the Oath. Felony in any Gentleman, or Person of higher Degrée, or any that is or hath born Office in Camp, Army or Company of Souldiers, to go beyond the Seas voluntarily to serve a Foreign Prince, or shall voluntarily serve any Prince unless he first enters into Bond to the King (not to the use of the King) Condi∣tioned, not to be reconciled to</HI> Rome, <HI>nor to enter into any Plot, against the King or Government. But after Knowledge thereof to Reveal the same, the Bond to be taken and the Ooth Administred by the Customer and Controuler of every Port, Haven or Créek or one of them; Which Bond and Oath are to be certifyed into the</HI> Exchequer <HI>once a Year upon Penalty of five pounds for every Bond and twenty pounds for every Oath not certifyed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treason in Re∣conciler and Reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> <HI>All Persons reconciling and reconciled to the See of</HI> Rome <HI>are Traytors. Every Person that Maintains, Retains, Relieves, Kéeps or Harbours in his, or their House, any Servant, Sojourner or Stranger that absents from Church for a Month, forfeits ten pounds, the same Forfeiture for Retaining or Keeping in his, her, or their Service, Fee, or Livery, any such Person or Persons. Father, Mother, Wards, and Persons Committed by Authority are excepted. Sheriffs and other Officers may break open Doors to Apprehend Pa∣pists Excommunicate. No Forfeiture for the Wives Offence. The Lords of the Privy Councel, or any six of them, whereof the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasur∣er or the principal Secretary, to be one, are impowred to Administer the said Oaths before mentioned to any Noble Man or Noble Woman above the Age of Eigh∣teen Years; refusing to take them, they incur a Premunire. In the Cinque Ports the Lord</HI> Warden <HI>of the Cinque Ports are to take the said Bond and Oaths.</HI></P></Q>
<P>What cause there was for the compiling this Oath, and imposing it upon the Pa∣pists, King <HI>James</HI> himself tells us in his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, take it in his own words.</P>
<Q><P><HI>But now having sacrificed (if I may say so) to the</HI> Manes <HI>of my late Predecessor</HI> Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> (whose Government and Moderation he vindicates,) <HI>I may next with St.</HI> Paul <HI>justly vindicate my own fame from those innumerable calumnies spread against me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This King de∣clares his fa∣vourableness towards the Papists, and their ingrati∣tude to him. <HI>Apol. p. 18, 19, 20.</HI></NOTE> <HI>in testifying the truth of my behaviour towards the</HI> Papists: <HI>wherein I may truly affirm that whatsoever was her just and merciful Government over the</HI> Papists <HI>in her time, my Government over them since, hath so far exceeded hers, in mercy and clemency, as not only the</HI> Papists <HI>themselves grew to that height of pride, in confidence of my mildness, as they did directly expect, and assuredly promise to themselves</HI> Liberty of Conscience, <HI>and equality with other of my Subjects, in all things, but even a number of the best and faithfullest of my said Subjects, were cast in great fear and amazement of my Course and Proceedings, ever Prognosticating, and justly suspecting, that sowr Fruit to come of it, which shewed it self clearly in the</HI> Powder-Treason.</P>
<P><HI>How many did I honour with Knighthood, of known and open Recusants? how indifferently did I give audience and access to both sides, bestowing equally all Favours and Honours on both Professions? How free and continual access had all ranks and degrees of</HI> Papists <HI>in my Court and Company? and above all how frankly and freely did I free</HI> Recusants <HI>of their ordinary payments</HI>?</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="56"/><HI>Besides, it is evident what strait order was given out of my mouth to the</HI> Judge; <HI>to spare Execution of all Priests</HI> (notwithstanding their Conviction) <HI>joyning thereunto a Gracious Pro∣clamation, whereby all Priests that were at Liberty, and not taken, might go out of the Country by such a day, my general Pardon having been extended to all Priests in Prison, whereupon they were set at Liberty, as good Subjects, and all convicted Priests that were taken after, sent over, and set at Liberty there. But Time and Paper will fail me to make ebnumeration of the benefits and favours that I bestowed, in general, and particular, upon Papists, in recounting whereof, every scrape of my Pen would serve but for a blot of the Popes ingratitude and injustice, in meeting me with so hard a measure for the same.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Yet notwithstanding all this Mildness and Clemency exercised towards them by the King, he himself in his Monotory Preface to all Christian Monarchs, tells us, That,</P>
<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monotory Pre∣face p. <HI>6, 7, 8, 9.</HI></NOTE><HI>The never-enough wondred at, and abhorred</HI> Powder-Treason (<HI>though the Repetition there∣of grieveth, I know, the gentle hearted Jesuite</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The same Parsons that I have before taken notice of, and who had the good luck all this while to scape the Gollows.</NOTE> Parsons) <HI>This Treason,</HI> I say, <HI>being not only in∣tended against me and my posterity, but even against the whole House of Parliament, plotted only by</HI> Papists, <HI>and they only led thereto by a preposterous zeal for the advancement of their Religion; some of them continuing so obstinate, that even at their death they would not acknowledg their fault; but in their last words immediately before the expiring of their breath, refused to condemn themselves, and crave pardon for their deed, except the</HI> Romish <HI>Church should first condemn it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And soon after, it being discovered, that a great number of my</HI> Popish <HI>Subjects of all</HI> Ranks <HI>and</HI> Sexes <HI>both Men and Women, as well within as without the Country, had a confused Notion, and an obscure knowledge, that some great thing was to be done in that Parliament for the weal of the Church, altho for secrecys cause they were not acquainted with the particulars, certain Forms of Prayer having likewise been set down and used for the good success of the great Errand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Adding hereunto that divers times, and from divers Priests, the Arch Traytors themselves received the Sacrament for confirmation of their heart and observation of Secresie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Some of the principal</HI> Jesuites <HI>likewise, being found</HI> Guilty <HI>of the foreknowledge of the Treason it self, of which number some fled from their Tryal, others were apprehended (as</HI> holy Garnet <HI>himself and</HI> Oldcorn <HI>were) and justly</HI> Executed <HI>upon their own plain</HI> Con∣fession <HI>of</HI> Guilt.</P>
<P><HI>If this Treason now clad with these circumstances, did not minister a just occasion to that Parliament House, whom they thought to have destroyed, couragiously and zealously at their next sitting down, to use all means of Tryal, whether any more of that</HI> mind, <HI>were yet left in the Country; I leave it to you</HI> (i.e. the Emperors, Kings and Princes) <HI>to judge, whom God hath appointed his highest Deputy Judges upon Earth; And amongst other things for this purpose, this Oath of Allegiance, so unjustly impugned, was then devised and enacted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And in case any sharper Laws were then made against the Papists that were not obedient to the former Laws of the Country, if ye will consider the time, place and persons, it will be thought no wonder, seeing that occasion did so justly exasperate them to make severer Laws then otherwise they would have done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Time <HI>I say, being the very next sitting of the Parliament, after the Discovery of that abominable Treason.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Place <HI>being the same where they should all have been blown up, and so bringing it fresh∣ly into their Memory again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Persons <HI>being those very Parliament Men whom they thought to have destroyed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And yet so far hath both my Heart and Government been from any bitterness, as almost never one of those sharp additions to the former Laws, have ever yet been put in Exe∣cution.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And that ye may yet know further for the more convincing these Libellers of wilful Malice, who impudently affirm, that this Oath of</HI> Allegiance <HI>was devised for deceiving and intrapping of</HI> Papists <HI>in point of Conscience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The truth is, that the</HI> Lower-House <HI>of Parliament at the first framing of this</HI> Oath, <HI>made it contain,</HI> that the Pope had no Power to Excommunicateme, <HI>which I caused them to reform, only making it to conclude,</HI> That no Excommunication of the Popes can warrant my Subjects to practice against my Person or State; <HI>denying the</HI> deposition <HI>of Kings to be in the Popes lawful Power. As indeed I take any such Temporal violence to be far without the Limits of such a spiritual Censure as Excommunication is.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="56"/><HI>So careful was I that nothing should be contained in this</HI> Oath, <HI>except the profession of</HI> Natural Allegiance, <HI>and</HI> Civil <HI>and</HI> Temporal obedience, <HI>with a Promise to resist all contrary un∣civil violence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Oath now grounded upon so great and just occasion, set forth in so reasonable Terms, and ordained only for making a true</HI> distinction between Papists <HI>of</HI> quiet dispotion, <HI>and in all other things</HI> good Subjects, <HI>and other</HI> Papists, such <HI>as in their hearts, maintained the like violent</HI> bloody Maxims <HI>that the</HI> Powder Traytor, <HI>did.</HI></P></Q>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">And here I can't but take notice, that the very design of the Oath of Al∣legiance was to make a distinction between Papists, of unquiet and turbulent, and of quiet and peaceable Minds, and had not, in its original, any influence upon the Protestants, nor did at the time of making, concern them, and that after Protestants were enjoyned to take it, the same was intended to no other purpose then to difference them from Papists, and therefore the taking the new Oaths to their present Majesties, cannot but be well consistent with the former Oath of Al∣legiance, especially if it be considered that the late King is himself a Papist.</NOTE> So that it is evident King <HI>James</HI> thought, the said Plots, Treasons, Conspiracies and other unbecoming and undutiful words and practices was ground sufficient to make the said Law.</P>
<P>And doubtless, The Powder-Treason justifies the <HI>State</HI> in making another <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI> the same Session, Intitled, <HI>An Act to prevent and avoid danger which may grow by Popish Recusants.</HI> The preamble of which Act making it further to appear, that the Powder-Treason was the occasion of making this Law, I shall here insert the Preamble <HI>verbatim,</HI> and then the substance of the Act.</P>

Bull against ta∣king the Oath of Allegiance. <HI>Foulis</HI> l. <HI>10.</HI> cap. <HI>3.</HI> f. <HI>528.</HI></NOTE> that there are found certain amongst you (who) when as we have sufficiently declared by ous Letters, Dated the last year on the 22<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> in the form of a Breve, that ye cannot with safe Conscience take the Oath which was then required of you, and when as we have further straitly Com∣manded you, that by no means you should take it.</P>
<P>Yet there are some (I say) among you, who dare now affirm, that such Letters con∣cerning the forbidding of the Oath, were not written of our own accord, or of our own proper Will. But rather for the re∣spect, and at the instigation of other Men; and for that cause the same Men go about to perswade you, that our Commands in the said Letter are not to be regarded.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="58"/>Truly this News did trouble us, and that so much the more, because having had experience of your obedience (most dearly beloved Sons) who to the end you might obey this holy See, have Godlily and Valiantly contemned your Riches, Wealth, Honour, Liberty, yea and Life it self: We should never have suspected, that the truth of our Apostolical Letters could once be called in question amongst you, that by this Pretence you might exempt your selves from our Commandments.</P>
<P>But we do perceive herein the subtilty and craft of the Enemy of Mans Salvation, and we do attribute this your backward∣ness rather to him, then to your own Will.</P>
<P>And for this cause we have thought good to write the second time unto you, and to signifie unto you again, that our Aposto∣lical Letters, dated the last year on the 22<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>September</HI> concerning the Prohibi∣tion of the Oath, were written not only upon our proper motion, and of our cer∣tain knowledge; but also after long and weighty Deliberation used concerning all those things, which are contained in them: And that for that cause you are bound fully to observe them, rejecting all interpretation perswading to the contrary.</P>
<P>And this is our meer, pure and perfect Will; who being always careful of your Salvation, do always mind those things which are most profitable unto you. And we do pray without ceasing, that he who hath appointed to our Lowliness the keeping of the flock of Christ, would en∣lighten our thoughts and counsels; whom we do also continually beseech, that he would increase in you (our most beloved Sons) Faith, Constancy, with mutual Cha∣rity, and Peace, one to another.

<P>In the 12<HI>th.</HI> Year of his Reign, there were a generation about the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camb. f. 77.</HI> A Parliament called and dis∣solved, because they complained of grievances and particular∣ly of the in∣crease of <HI>Pa∣pists.</HI></NOTE> that undertook for the calling such a Parliament as the King would have, these were Men that presumed, they had friends in every County and Borough, who (by their power among the People) could make Election of such Men for Knights and Burgesses, as should comply solely with the Kings desire; and <HI>Somerset</HI> was the head and chief of these undertakers, but these projects against the Fundamentals of the <HI>English</HI> Government proved an abortive; for the Parliament meeting, such Faces appeared there, as was no ways pleasing to the <HI>Court,</HI> who instead of contributing to the Kings wants, lay open his wasts, especially upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> with whom they de∣sire a share of Favour.</P>
<P>The Bread (by our Saviour's Rule) properly belongs to the Children of the Kingdom, and they beseech his Majesty to stop the Current of future access of that Nation to make residence here, having enough to eat up their own <HI>Crums,</HI> they en∣quire into the Causes of the unexpected increase of <HI>Popish</HI> Recusants since the <HI>Gunpow∣der Plot,</HI> the detestation whereof (they thought) should have utterly extinguished them, and they attribute it to the admission of <HI>Popish</HI> Nobility into his Councels; the silencing of many watchful and dilligent Ministers, the divers Treaties his Majesty had entertained, not only for the Marriage of Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> but for Prince <HI>Charles</HI> with the Daughters of <HI>Popish</HI> Princes, which disheartned the <HI>Protestant</HI> and encouraged the <HI>Papist</HI>; they laid open with these many other miscarriages in Government, the King desirous to conceal these Matters dissolves the Parliament and Committed to the <HI>Tower</HI> and other Prisons, such as were most active for the common good, and who can deny but that this must needs give encouragement to the <HI>Papists</HI>?</P>
<P>In the 15<HI>th.</HI> Year of his Reign he put out a Book to Tollerate Sports on the <HI>Lords Days</HI>; this Book came out with a Command, injoyning all Ministers to read it to their Parishoners, and to approve of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Book of Sports obtru∣ded.</NOTE> and those that did not were brought be∣fore the <HI>High Commission,</HI> Imprisoned, and Suspended. This was a contrivance of the <HI>Papists</HI> and their adherents, to trap the most Conscientious Men of the Church of <HI>England</HI> (who were in all other matters exactly conformable) and to lay them aside; and good reason the <HI>Papists</HI> had for this, because no Nation will ever receive their innovations in Matters of Religion, where there is a Sound, Orthodox, Learned and Pious Clergy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilsons <HI>Hist.</HI> f. 105.</NOTE> <HI>Wilson</HI> says, that some of the Ministers that were Suspended said, that they would Preach the Gospel in a <HI>Fools Coat</HI> rather then be silent for a <HI>Surplis</HI>; and the Conjuring of them with the Cross in Baptism and the Circle of the Ring in Marriage, could not make a well composed Reason, and a sound Conscience then start at it: But when so frighful an Aparition as the <HI>Dancing</HI> Book appeared, some of the Ministers left all for fear, others by force, they were so terrified by it.</P>
<P>This I have set down in <HI>Willsons</HI> own words, because it appears by this that the Men that were suspended, were proceeded against not for <HI>Puritanism,</HI> or <HI>Nonconformity</HI> to the discipline of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but for non-complying with things obtruded on them, by right down <HI>Papists,</HI> or those (who whether they saw it or no I cannot tell) were carrying on the <HI>Popish</HI> designs.</P>

<P>By this Letter it plainly appears, that it was the Arch-Bishops Opinion, that it tended much to the promoting the Reformation, that the Count <HI>Palatine</HI> should accept the Crown of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Crown of <HI>England</HI> should stand by him in it; and who∣ever reads the most impartial writers of those times will find, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Match, which was then a foot, and <HI>Popish</HI> Councels at home, was the true Cause of the loss of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and the ruine of that <HI>Protestant</HI> Prince; and how could things be expected otherwise, so long as <HI>Gondamor,</HI> had so far the ascendant of the King, that when the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> solicited the King (after the War was begun) to send more Forces, <HI>Gondamor</HI> obstructed it, whatever he desired was done, and few or none were well respected at Court but <HI>Spanish</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Wilsons 144.

After the <HI>Palatinate</HI> was lost, the King outwardly seemed willing to assist towards the Recovery of it; and therefore proposes it first to the Privy Councel, and after∣wards called a Parliament which was to meet the thirteenth of <HI>January,</HI> in the 18<HI>th.</HI> Year of his Reign, proposing to himself that the People for regaining the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> would open their Purses, which he might make use of, and that a good agreement Between him and his People, would induce his Brother of <HI>Spain</HI> to be more Active, and so he should have supply from the one, and dispatch from the other, <HI>i. e.</HI> Mony and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Match, were the ends he aimed at, let the <HI>Palatinate</HI> Sink or Swim, 'twas no matter.</P>
<P>This the Jesuits and Seminary Priests knew well enough, and therefore they,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilsons <HI>Hist.</HI> f. 151.</NOTE> range∣ing up and down like Spirits let loose, did not now, as formerly, creep into Corners, using close and cunning Artifices, but practised them openly, having admission to our Councellors of State. And when <HI>Secretaries</HI> and such as manage the intimate Councels of Kings, are Jesuits, and Clients to the <HI>Pope,</HI> there can be no tendency of affection to a contrary Religion, or Policy. Yet these were the Men that carried all before them at Court: And the <HI>Protestant</HI> interest must <HI>needs</HI> flourish under such Ministers of State; especially if it be considered; that <HI>England</HI> was not only Man'd with <HI>Jesuits</HI> (all Power now failing to oppose them) but the Women also began to practice the Trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Women Jesui∣trices.</NOTE> calling themselves <HI>Jesuitrices</HI>: This Order was first set on foot in <HI>Flanders,</HI> by Mrs. <HI>Ward</HI> and

Mrs. <HI>Twitty,</HI> two <HI>English</HI> Gentlewomen, who Cloathed themselves in <HI>Ignatian</HI> Habit, and were Countenanced and Supported by Father <HI>Gerrard</HI> Rector of the <HI>English</HI> Col∣ledge at <HI>Leige,</HI> with Father <HI>Flack</HI> and Father <HI>More.</HI> Their design was to Preach the <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrine to their own Sex in <HI>England,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> to Alienate their Hearts from their Soveraign, if he be not of their Religion, or will not at least connive at it;) to engage them in Plots, Conspiracies and Treasons, for the destroying Heretical, <HI>i. e. Protestant</HI> Kings, and Heresie, that is, Protestantism, that they do, or should defend.</P>
<P>This project took so (as any thing doth that tends to promoting Mother Church) that in a short time this Mrs. <HI>Ward,</HI> by the <HI>Popes</HI> indulgence (who will indulge any thing that tends to destroy, what he calls Heresie) became the Mother General, of no less then two Hundred <HI>English</HI> Damsels of good Birth and Quallity, whom she sent abroad to Preach.</P>

<PB N="99" REF="61"/>
shall undertake the Defence of his own Cause) he may be able to do that with his Sword, which by a peaceable Course shall not be effected.</HI></P></Q>

<P>The Parliament met again the twentieth of <HI>November,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment meet.</NOTE> and because the House of Commons found, that though the King declared for War, he pursued Peace, and re∣solved to close with <HI>Spain.</HI> They resolved to try the Kings Spirit by the following Petition and Remonstrance, wherein they laid open the Distempers of those Times, with their Causes and Cures.</P>
<P>The Causes they told him were these: <Q>The Vigilance and Ambition of the <HI>Pope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Remonstrance by the Parlia∣ment against Popery.</HI> Wilson f. 167. Rushw. Coll. 1 pt. f. 40.</NOTE> and his Son the <HI>Spanish</HI> Prince: The Devilish Doctrines of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church: The distressed Estate of the Protestants abroad: The disasterous Accidents to his <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg2">The Count <HI>Palatines</HI> Fa∣mily.</NOTE> Chil∣dren abroad: The strange Confederacy of the <HI>Popish</HI> Princes, to subvert the <HI>Prote∣stant</HI> Religion here: The great Armies raised by the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> The Papists Expecta∣tions of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Match: Foreign Princes interposing for Favour to <HI>Papists</HI> here: The Papists open Resort to Foreign Ambassadors: Their Concourse to <HI>London,</HI> and their Conventicles there: The Education of their Children in <HI>Seminaries:</HI> The Grants of their Forfeitures to Persons, who take little or nothing of them: The printing <HI>Popish</HI> Books: The Swarms of <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Jesuits:</HI> (The common Incendiaries of all Christendom) disperst in all parts of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>The growing Mischiefs to <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> they told him were these: <Q>The <HI>Po∣pish</HI> Religion is incompatable with ours, and draws with it an unavoidable Depen∣dance on Foreign Princes. It opens a wide Gap for <HI>Popularity,</HI> to any who shall draw too great a Party; <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg2">We have lately seen the Truth of this verified, when the Papists from Conni∣vance, actually got a Toleration, and that with an Equality, and had got the Superiority, and subverted our Religion, had not God in his Providence interposed.</NOTE> it hath a restless Spirit, and will strive by these <HI>Gradati∣ons.</HI> If it get but a <HI>Connivance,</HI> it will press for a <HI>Toleration</HI>; if that should be obtained, they must have an Equality; from thence they will aspire to Superiority, and will never rest till they get a <HI>Subversion</HI> of the true Religion.</Q></P>
<P>The Remedies proposed were: <Q>That the King would take his Sword into his Hand; that he would therewith assist the <HI>Protestants</HI> abroad, not to rest upon a War in these Parts only, but give a Diversion otherwise: That this War might be against him, that had maintained the War in the <HI>Palatinate</HI>: That he would put the Laws in Execution against the <HI>Papists:</HI> That the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg2"><HI>Charles</HI> the First.</NOTE> <HI>Prince</HI> might be married to a <HI>Protestant</HI>: That the Children of the Nobility and Gentry beyond Seas, might be called home: That <HI>Papists</HI> Children, and their Children, whose Wives were <HI>Papists,</HI> might be educated by <HI>Protestant</HI> School-Masters and Teachers: That the King would revoak all former Licences for Youth to travel beyond Sea, and grant no more after. That all former Grants of <HI>Papists</HI> Lands might be avoided, if by Law they could, and no such Grants made afterwads.</Q></P>

<P>No wonder then, that the Papists were quiet here in <HI>England,</HI> and not engaged in Plots and Contrivances against the Kings Person; for the Reason is plain, the whole Substance of the Spanish Treaty, was a Plot for ruining the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and thereby weakning, in order to destroy, the Protestant Interest abroad; which they effected, by feeding the King with the Hopes of that Match, and thereby diverting him from taking the Parliaments Advice, in order to recover the <HI>Palatinate</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">You may read the whole Story in <HI>VVilson</HI> and <HI>Rushworth.</HI></NOTE> and when they had brought their Designs about, and the <HI>Palatinate</HI> was irretrievably lost, they broke off the <HI>Match,</HI> and left the King and Prince in the Lurch.

In <HI>August</HI> 1624. this <HI>Match</HI> was concluded, and in <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> the Articles were sworn unto by King <HI>James,</HI> Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King; the Articles concerning Religion, were not much short of those for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Match.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Papists encou∣raged by the Treaty with <HI>France.</HI></P><P><HI>Rushw.

Among others, <HI>Matthew Kil∣lison</HI> and <HI>Richard Smith</HI> were presented.</P>
<P>And though the <HI>Regulars</HI> were opposite to the <HI>Seculars</HI> in this Matter, yet those of the Order of St. <HI>Benedict</HI> joyned with the Seculars, and <HI>Rudesin Barlo,</HI> the President of the English <HI>Benedictines</HI> of <HI>Doway,</HI> wrote a Letter in their Behalf, at the Congregation at <HI>Rome,</HI> named of the Propagation of the Faith.

<P>In which Letter was this Passage: <Q>That there were above sixty <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monks in <HI>England</HI>; and that it is not to be doubted (said he) (for that it is already seen, the good Success under the first Bishop) that another Bishop being constituted, there would be more joyful Fruits within two Years, in the <HI>English Mission,</HI> than hitherto hath been for sixty years now lapsed.</Q></P>
<P>But not long after the <HI>Episcopal</HI> party of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church prevailing, <HI>Pope Ʋrban</HI> the VIII. created <HI>Richard Smith</HI> Bishop of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> and sent him into <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Episcopal</HI> Authority over the <HI>Priests</HI> within the <HI>English</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The Close of this Kings Reign.</P><P><HI>Rushw.

<PB N="103" REF="63"/>
the Power he left him, to restablish him in the Estate and Dignitys of his Father on the 27th of <HI>March</HI> in the Twenty third Year of his Reign he gave up the Ghost.</P>
<P>From what Account I have given of Matters relating to the making the Penal Laws, and the Reasons of not putting them in Execution in this Kings Reign, I gather these things,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is no heed to be taken to any promises made, Advice given nor Oaths taken by <HI>Papists,</HI> for if the Interest of the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion Intervenes, the Pro∣mises, Advice, yea even the Oaths themselves, must give way, and 'tis <HI>Meritorious</HI> too.</P>
<P N="2">2. That when it is to serve the <HI>Popish</HI> Interest, they are allowed to deny the plainest truths, although confest by Men <HI>in Articulo Mortis,</HI> at the very point of Death.</P>
<P N="3">3. That whenever they are detected of any <HI>Conspiracy</HI> or <HI>Treason,</HI> they immediately set their Wits to work, to throw the <HI>odium</HI> of it upon some sort of <HI>Protestants</HI> or other, nay sometimes they make it an essential part of the <HI>Conspiracy</HI> it self.</P>
<P N="4">4. That when they found themselves lost as to more private <HI>Conspiracies,</HI> they in∣volved <HI>Christendom</HI> in War, to destroy the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest, upon the Colour of the Elector <HI>Palatines</HI> having Usurped the Crown of <HI>Bohemia</HI> notwithstanding he was le∣gally Elected; and made use of the <HI>Cowardise</HI> of King <HI>James</HI> to carry on that De∣sign.</P>
<P N="5">5. That they want not Arts to deceive even <HI>Protestants</HI> themselves, if they look not narrowly to them; so much can they transform themselves into the likeness of <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. That the loss of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> the differences between King <HI>James</HI> the first and his <HI>Parliaments,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Treaty, and at last the compleating the <HI>French</HI> Match, were all carried on by <HI>Popish</HI> Intregues and to serve the Popes turn.</P>
<P>Certainly then, there was good reason for the making the Penal Laws in this Kings Reign, and the Parliament are greatly justified in pressing an Execution of them, which had it been granted, a Man may with good reason believe all the Civil Wars in the suc∣ceeding Reign had been prevented.</P>
<P>And this might lead me to show the share the Popish Party had in the beginning, managing and carrying on that unhappy and ever to be lamented War; but my de∣sign being only to show the reasonableness of making the Penal Laws against the Papists, and there being but one Law made against them in this unfortunate Princes Reign, I shall only give the grounds of making that Law, and pass on to the Reign of his Son King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>

<ITEM>1. The want of the due Execution of the Laws against <HI>Jesuits, Seminary Priests,</HI> and <HI>Popish</HI> Recusants; occasioned partly by the Connivency of the State, partly by defects in the Laws themselves, and partly by the manifold abuse of Officers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The interposing of Foreign Princes by their Ambassadors, and Agents in favour of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Their great Concourse to the City and frequent Conferences and Conventicles there.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The open and usual resort to the House and Chappels of Foreign Ambassa∣dors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. the Education of their Children, in Seminaries and Houses of their Religion in Foreign Parts, which of late hath been greatly multiplied and enlarged for the enter∣taining of the <HI>English.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That in some places of your Realm your People be not sufficiently Instructed in the Knowledge of the true Religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The Licentious Printing and Dispersing of Popish and Seditious Books.</ITEM>

<P N="1"><LABEL>The Remedies against this Outragious and dangerous Disease, we conceive to be these ensuing.</LABEL>
1. That the Youth of this Realm be carefully Educated by careful and Religious Schoolmasters, and they to be enjoyned to Catechize and Instruct their Schollars, in their Grounds and Principles of true Religion. And whereas by many Complaints from divers Parts of the Kingdom it doth plainly appear, That sundry <HI>Popish</HI> Schollars dissembling their Religion, have craftily crept in and obtained the Places of Teach∣ing in divers Counties, and thereby infected and perverted their Schollars, and so fit∣ted them to be.

And being asked why he did so? He Answered, that he was no Informer: And being asked of some particulas, whether they come to the Church or not, his Answer was, they did not.

<P N="4">4.

<P>A Parliament was Summoned to meet the 17<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> 1627. and a little before this Parliament Assembled, a Society of <HI>Papists</HI> were taken in <HI>Clerkenwel</HI>; divers of them were <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and the House wherein they were taken was designed to be a Colledge of that <HI>Order.</HI></P>

it contains Matter that justifies the making of the Law that was made against the <HI>Papists</HI> in this Sessions of Parliament, as I find it Printed in <HI>Rushworth,</HI> f. 474. I have here inserted.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter from a <HI>Jesuit</HI> concerning the ensuing PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Father Rector,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET not the damp of astonishment seize upon your Ardent and Zealous Soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter from a <HI>Jesuit</HI> con∣cerning the en∣suing <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI> Rushw. Coll. <HI>1. pt.</HI> f. <HI>474.</HI></NOTE> in apprehend∣ing the suddain and unexpected calling of a Parliament: We have not opposed but rather furthered it; so that we hope as much in this Parliament as ever we feared any in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> days.</P>
<P>You must know the Council is engaged to assist the King by way of Prerogative, in Case the Parliament any way should fail. You shall see this Parliament will resemble the <HI>Pelican,</HI> which takes a pleasure to dig out with her Beak her own Bowels.</P>
<P>The Election of Knights and Burgesses hath been in such confusion of apparent faction, as that which we were wont to procure heretofore with much Art and Industry (when the <HI>Spanish Match</HI> was in Treaty) now breaks out naturally as a botch or boyl and spews out its own Rankor and Venom.</P>
<P>You remember how that famous and immortal Statesman the Connt of <HI>Gondomar</HI> fed King <HI>James</HI> his fancy and Rocked him asleep with the soft sweet sound of Peace, to keep up the <HI>Spanish</HI> Treaty; likewise we were much bound to some Statesmen of our own Country, for gaining time by procuring the most advantageous Cessation of Arms in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> and advancing the Honour and integrity of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation, and villifying the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> remonstrating to King <HI>James</HI> that the State was most ungrateful both to his Predecessor Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and his Sacred Majesty; that the States were more obnoxious then the <HI>Turk,</HI> and perpetually injured his Majesties Loving Subjects in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and likewise they have usurped from his Majesty the Regality and unvaluable profit of the narrow Seas, in fishing upon the <HI>English</HI> Coasts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This great Statesman had but one principal means to further their great and good designs, which was to set on King <HI>James</HI> that none but the <HI>Puritan</HI> Faction, which plotted nothing but Anarchy and his Confusion were averse to this most happy Ʋnion. We Steered on the same Course, and have made great use of this Anarchical Election, and have prejudicated and anticipated the great one, that none but the Kings Enemies, and his, are chosen of this Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We have now many Strings to our Bow, and have strongly Fortified our Faction, and have added two Bulwarks more: For when King <HI>James</HI> lived (you know) he was very violent against <HI>Arminianism,</HI> and interrupted (with his pestilent Wit and Learning) our strong designs in <HI>Holland,</HI> and was a great Friend to that Old Rebel and Heretick the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> Now we have planted that Soveraign drug <HI>Arminianism,</HI> which we hope will purge the Protestants from their Heresie; and it Flourisheth and beareth Fruit in due Season.</P>
<P>The Materials which build up our Bulwark, are the Projectors and Beggars of all Ranks and Qualities, howsoever both these Factions co-operate to destroy the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and to intro∣duce a new Species and Form of Government, which is <HI>Oliargchy.</HI></P>
<P>Those serve as direct Mediums and Instruments to our End, which is the Ʋniversal <HI>Catho∣lick Monarchy.</HI> Our Foundation must be Mutation, and Mutation will cause a Relaxation, which will serve as so many violent Diseases, as the Stone, Gout, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the speedy Distraction of our perpetual and insufferable Anguish of Body, which is worse than Death it self.</P>
<P>We proceed now by Councel and mature Deliberation, how, and when to work upon the <HI>Dukes</HI> Jealousie and Revenge, and in this we give the Honour to those which merit it, which are the <HI>Church Catholics.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Matter of Consequence, which we take much into our Consideration and Tender care, which is to stave off <HI>Puritans,</HI> that they hang not in the <HI>Dukes</HI> Ears, they are impudent subtil People.</P>
<P>And it is to be feared, least they should negotiate a Reconciliation between the <HI>Duke</HI> and the Parliament at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Westminster;</HI> but now we assure our Selves, we have so handled the Matter, that both <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Parliament</HI> are irrecon∣cileable.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="70"/>For the better prevention of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> the <HI>Arminians</HI> have already lockt up the <HI>Dukes</HI> Ears, and we have those of our own Religion which stand continually at the <HI>Dukes</HI> Chamber, to see who goes in and out; we cannot be too circumspect and careful, in this Regard.</P>
<P>I cannot chuse but laugh, to see how some of our <HI>Coat</HI> have accoutred themselves; you would scarce know them if you saw them; and 'tis admirable, how in Speech and Gesture they act the <HI>Puritans.</HI> The <HI>Cambridge</HI> Schollars, to their woful Experience, shall see we can act the <HI>Puritan</HI> a little better than they have done the <HI>Jesuites</HI>: They have abused our sacred Patron, St. <HI>Igna∣tius</HI> in jest, but we will make them smart for it in earnest. I hope you will excuse my merry Digression, for I confess unto you, I am at this time transported with Joy, to see how happily all Instruments and Means, as well great as less, co-operate unto our Purposes.</P>
<P>But to return unto the main Fabrick, our Foundation is <HI>Arminianism.</HI> The <HI>Arminians</HI> and <HI>Projectors,</HI> as it appears in the Premises, affect Mutation, this we second, and enforce by probable Arguments; in the first place, we take into Consideration, the Kings Honour and present Necessity, and we shew how the King may free himself of his Word, as <HI>Lewis</HI> the Eleventh did, and for his great Splendor and Lustre, he may raise a vast Revenue, and not be beholden to his Sub∣jects, which is by way of Imposition and Excise, then our Church <HI>Catholicks</HI> proceed, to show the Means how to settle this Excise, which must be by a <HI>mercenary</HI> Army of Horse and Foot. For the Horse, we have made that sure, they shall be Forreigners and <HI>Germans,</HI> who will eat up the Kings Revenues, and spoil the Country where-ever they come, though they should be well paid; what Havock will they make there, when they get no Pay, or are not duly paid? they will do more Mischief then we hope the Army will do.</P>
<P>We are provident and careful that this <HI>mercenary Army,</HI> of two thousand Horse, and twenty thousand Foot, shall be taken on and in Pay before the Excise be setled. In forming the Excise, the Country is most likely to rise: If the <HI>Mercenary Army</HI> subju∣gate the Country, then the Souldiers and <HI>Projectors</HI> shall be paid out of the Confiscati∣ons; if the Country be too hard for the Souldiers, then they must consequently mutiny, which is equally advantagious unto us, our superlative Design, is to work, the <HI>Protestants,</HI> as well as the <HI>Catholicks,</HI> to welcome in a <HI>Conqueror,</HI> and that is by this Means: We hope instantly to dissolve Trades, and hinder the building of Shipping, in devising probable Designs, and putting on the State upon Expeditions, as that of <HI>Cadiz</HI> was, in taking away the Merchant Ships, so that they may not easily catch and light upon the <HI>West-India</HI> Fleet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>His Majesties ANSWER to the Eighth ARTICLE.</HEAD>
<P>TO the eighth, His Majesty doth well approve it, as a Matter of necessary Consi∣deration, and the Parliament now sitting, he recommendeth to both Houses, the Preparation of a fitting Law to that effect. And His Majesty doth further declare, that the Mildness that hath been used towards those of the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion, hath been upon Hope, that Foreign Princes thereby might be induced to use Moderation towards their Subjects of the <HI>Reformed</HI> Religion; but not finding that good Effect which was expected, His Majesty resolveth, unless he shall very speedily see better Fruits, to add a further degree of Severity, to that which in that Petition is de∣sired.</P>

<P>Before this Act of Parliament was made, the Papists were ingaged in a most <HI>Horrid Plot</HI> against the Protestant Religion, and the Parliament having now made this Act, whereby the Papists are excluded from all Places of Profit and Trust; it is not hard to believe that their Malice was thereby greatly heightned, and their Rage very much increased against the Protestants; and their Actings put it beyond doubt that it was so. For this Act passed in the Year 1673. and then it is we find them deeply ingaged in contriving our Destruction; and so inhumane were they, that not∣withstanding the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Kindness to them, yet, unless he would fully comply with them in the butchering his Protestant Subjects, extirpating the Pro∣testant Religion (which they called a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Coleman's <HI>Tryal,</HI> p. 69.</NOTE> Pestilent Heresie) and the introducing of the Romish Superstition and Idolatry, he must be taken out of the way, to make room for one that would.</P>
<P>I confess, I have met with very many that have owned the Dis-believing of any such Design, but when I seriously reflect upon the Letters that were produced against Mr. <HI>Coleman,</HI> and owned by himself to be his; when I consider the Evidence that was given by all the Witnesses that proved the Horrid and Treasonable Popish Plot, that was discovered in 1678. and the Agreement that there is in the Substance of the thing (although there may be some Variations as to Circumstances) when I consider the Witnesses were Strangers to one another, that did so agree in their Testimony, and that the Discovery was so sudden, and the Witnesses came in so quick one after another, after the Discovery, that it is not to be presumed there could be any Suborna∣tion; when I consider the Credit they had with the King himself, and with four Par∣liaments; when I consider the great Attempts notwithstanding, to take the Odium off the Papists, and cast it upon the Protestants; when I consider the unwearied Pains taken by the Papists, and some that are much worse, because they espoused their Cause under a Protestant Vizar, to lay the Murther of Sir <HI>Edmond-Bury-Godfrey</HI> at the Prote∣stants Door, and to wipe off the Stain thereof from the Papists; when I consider the Methods that were taken in the late King <HI>James</HI> the Seconds his Reign, so exactly pursuant to what was designed, in case <HI>Charles</HI> the Second had fallen (as was contrived) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Either by Shooting, Poi∣son or Stobing.</NOTE> the first of which Methods was, by granting a general <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">The Decla∣ration for Li∣berty of Con∣science, Design∣ed to be pub∣lished, in case the Popish Plot had then taken effect, you may find printed in <HI>Coleman's</HI> Trial, <HI>p. 58.</HI></NOTE> Liberty of Conscience, and thereby deluding divers Protestants to serve a Popish Interest, although against their Wills; it is to me matter of Amazement, that there should remain the least doubt of the Truth of that Plot, in the Minds of any that are really Protestants; espe∣cially when I consider that there wanted nothing in the late King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, but a Parliament to take off the Penal Laws and Tests, to bring that Popish Plot to the highest Perfection that the Papists ever designed, and what Endeavors there were to obtain that, is sufficiently known.</P>
<P>To run through the whole Series of that Popish Plot, would be to draw out this Account of the Grounds of making the Penal Laws to a Length beyond what its De∣sign can warrant, which is the publick Good, and therefore as a Confirmation of the Truth of that Plot, and to refresh the Memory of those, who perhaps are willing to forget it, I shall here only insert <HI>Coleman</HI>'s Letters, as you will find them printed in his Tryal, and also <HI>Bedloes</HI> Depositions, as they were taken before, and printed by Sir <HI>Francis North,</HI> then Lord Chief Justice of the Common-Pleas, and afterwards made

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Coleman's</HI> First Letter.</HEAD>
<P>SInce Father St. <HI>German</HI> has been so kind to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coleman<HI>'s Tryal,</HI> p. 44.</NOTE> as to recommend me to your Reverence so advantagiously, as to encourage you to accept of my Correspon∣dency; I will own to him, that he has done me a Favour without consulting me, greater than I could have been capable of if he had advised with me, because I could not then have had the Confidence to have permitted him to ask it on my Be∣half. And I am so sensible of the Honour you are pleased to do me, that though I cannot deserve it, yet to shew at least the Sense I have of it, I will deal as freely and openly with you this first time, as if I had had the Honour of your Acquaintance all my Life. And shall make no Apology for so doing, but only tell you, that I know your Character perfectly well, though I am not so happy as to know your Person; and that I have an Opportunity of putting this Letter into the Hands of Father St. <HI>Germans</HI> Nephew (for whose Integrity and Prudence he has undertaken) without any sort of Hazard.</P>
<P>In order then Sir, to the plainness I profess, I will tell you what has formerly pas∣sed between your Reverences Predecessor, Father <HI>Ferryer</HI> and my self. About three Years ago, when the King my Master sent a Troop of Horse Guards into his most Christian Majesties Service, under the Command of my Lord <HI>Durass,</HI> he sent with it an Officer, called Sir <HI>William Throckmorton,</HI> with whom I had a particular Intimacy, and who had then very newly imbraced the Catholic Religion; to him did I con∣stantly write, and by him address my self to Father <HI>Farryer.</HI> The first thing of great Importance, I presumed to offer him (not to trouble you with lesser Matters, or what passed here before, and immediately after the fatal Revolution of the Kings Declaration for Liberty of Conscience (to which we owe all our Miseries and Ha∣zards) was in <HI>July, August</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> 1673. when I constantly inculcated the great Danger the Catholic Religion, and his most Christian Majesties Interest would be in at our next Sessions of Parliament, which was then to be in <HI>October</HI> follow∣ing; at which I plainly foresaw, that the King my Master would be forced to something in prejudice to his Alliance with <HI>France.</HI> Which I saw so evidently and particularly, that we should make Peace with <HI>Holland</HI>; that I urged all the Argu∣ments I could, which to me were Demonstrations, to convince your Court of that Mischief, and pressed all I could to perswade his most Christian Majesty to use his utmost Endeavor to prevent that Session of our Parliament, and proposed Expedients how to do it: But was answered so often and so positively, that his most Christian Majesty was so well assured by his Embassador here, our Embassador there, the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and even the King himself, that he had no such Apprehensions at all, but was fully satisfied to the contrary, and looked upon what I offered as a very zealous Mistake; that I was forced to give over arguing, though not believing as I did, but confidently appealed to Time and Success to prove who took their Measures rightest. When it happened what I foresaw came to pass; the good Father was a little surprised to see all the great Men mistaken, and a little one in the Right, and was pleased by Sir <HI>William Throckmorton,</HI> to desire the Continuance of my Correspon∣dence, which I was mighty willing to comply with, knowing the Interest of our King, and in a more particular manner, of my more immediate Master, the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>James</HI> the Se∣cond.</NOTE> Duke, and his most Christian Majesty, to be so inseparably united, that it was impossible to divide them, without destroying them all. Upon this I shewed that our Parliament, in the Circumstances it was, managed by the timerous Councels of our Ministers, who then governed, would never be useful either to <HI>England, France,</HI> or Catholic Religion; but that we should as certainly be forced from our Neutrality at their next Meeting, as we had been from our active Alliance with <HI>France</HI> the last Year: That a Peace, in the Circumstances we were in, was much more to be desired than the Continuance of the War; and that the Dissolution of our Parliament would certain∣ly procure a Peace: For that the Confederates did more depend upon the Power they had in our Parliament than upon any thing else in the World: And were more en∣couraged
<PB REF="74"/>
from them to the continuing of the War: So that if they were Dissolved, their measures would be all broken, and they consequently in a manner necessitated to a Peace.</P>
<P>The good Father minding this Discourse somewhat more then the Court of <HI>France</HI> thought fit to do my former, urg'd it so home to the King, that his Majesty was pleased to give him Orders to signifie to his <HI>R. H.</HI> my Master, that his Majesty was ful∣ly satisfied of his <HI>R. H's.</HI> good intention towards him, that he esteemed both their Interests, but as one and the same: That my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and the Parliament were both to be lookt upon as very unuseful to their Interest. That if his <HI>R. H.</HI> would endeavour to dissolve this Parliament, his most Christian Majesty would assist him with his Power and Purse to have a new one, as should be for their purpose. This and a great many more Expressions of kindness and confidence, <HI>Father Ferryer</HI> was pleased to Communicate to Sir <HI>William Throckmorton,</HI> and commanded them to send them to His Royal Hhighness, and withal to beg his Royal Highness to propose to his most Christian Majesty, what he thought necessary for his own Concern, and the ad∣vantage of Religon, and his Majesty would certainly do all he could to ad∣vance both or either of them. This Sir <HI>William Throckmorton</HI> sent to me by an Ex∣press, who left <HI>Paris</HI> the Second of <HI>June</HI> 1674. <HI>Stilo novo.</HI> I no sooner had it, but I Communicated it to his <HI>R. H.</HI> To which his <HI>R. H.</HI> commanded me to Answer as I did on the twenty ninth of the same Month, That his <HI>R. H.</HI> was very sensible of his most Christian Majesties Friendship, and that he would Labour to cultivate it with all the good Offices he was capable of doing for His Majesty: That he was fully convinced that their Interests were both one: That my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and the Parliament were not only unuseful, but very dangerous both to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI>: That therefore it was necessary, that they should do all they could to dissolve it. And that his <HI>R. H's.</HI> opinion was, that if his most Christian Majesty would write his thoughts freely to the King of <HI>England</HI> upon this Subject, and make the same proffer to his Majesty of his Purse to dissolve this Parliament, which he had made to his <HI>R. H.</HI> to Call another, he did believe it very possible for him to succeed with the Assistance we should be able to give him here: And that if this Parliament were dissolved, there would be no great difficulty of getting a new one, which would be more useful. The Constitutions of our Parliaments being such, that a new one can never hurt the Crown, nor an old one do it good.</P>
<P>His <HI>R. H.</HI> being pleased to own these Propositions which were but only General, I thought it reasonable to be more particular, and come closer to the Point, we might go the faster about the work, and come to some issue before the time was too far spent.</P>
<P>I laid this for my Maxim: The dissolving of our Parliament will certainly pro∣cure a Peace: Which Proposition was granted by every Body I conversed withal; even by <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI> himself, with whom I took Liberty of conversing so far, but durst not say any thing of the Intelligence I had with Father <HI>Ferryer.</HI> Next, that a Sum of Money certain, would certainly procure a Dissolution; this some doubt∣ed; but I am sure I never did: For I knew perfectly well, that the King had fre∣quent Disputes with himself at that time, whether he should dissolve or continue them: And he several times declared that the Arguments were so strong on both sides, that he could not tell to which to incline; but was carried at last to the conti∣nuance of them by this one Argument; if I try them once more, they may possibly give me Money; if they do, I have gained my Point: If they do not, I can dissolve them then, and be where I am now: So that I have a possibility at least of getting Money for their continuance, against nothing on the other side. But if we could have turn'd this Argument, and said, Sir, their Dissolution will certainly procure you Money, when you have only a bare possibility of getting any by their conti∣nuance, and have shewn how far that bare possibility was from being a Foundation to build any reasonable hope upon, which I am sure His Majesty was sensible of: And how much 300000 Pounds Sterling certain (which was the Sum we propos'd) was better than a bare possibility (without any reason to hope that, that could ever be Compassed) of having half so much more (which was the most he design'd to ask) upon some vile dishonourable Terms; and a thousand other hazards; which he had great reason to be afraid of; if I say, we had had Power to have argued this, I am most Confidently assured, we could have Compassed it, for Logick in our Court built upon Money, has more powerful Charms than any other sort of reasoning.
<PB N="125" REF="74"/>
But to secure his most Christian Majesty from any hazard, as to that Point I propos'd His Majesty should offer that Sum upon that Condition, and if the Condition were not perform'd, the Money should never be due; If it were, and that a Peace would certainly follow thereupon (which no Body doubted) His Majesty would gain his Ends, and save all the vast Expences of the next Campaign, by which he could not hope to better his Condition, or put himself into more advantagious Circumstances of Treaty then he was then in: But might very probably be in a much worse, con∣sidering the mighty opposition he was like to meet with, and the uncertain Chances of War. But admitting that His Majesty could by his great Strength and Conduct main∣tain himself in as good a Condition to Treat the next Year, as he was then in (which was as much as could then reasonably be hoped for) he should have saved by this Proposal, as much as all the Men, he must needs lose, and all the Charges he should be in a Year, would be valued to amount to more than 300000 Pounds Sterling, and so much more in Case his Condition should decay, as it should be worse than it was when this was made: And the Condition of his <HI>R. H.</HI> and of the Catholick Religion here (which depends very much upon the success of his most Christian Majesty) delivered from a great wany frights and real hazards, Father <HI>Ferryer</HI> seemed to be very sensible of the benefit, all Parties would gain by this Proposal. But yet it was unfortunately delayed by an unhappy and tedious Fit of Sickness, which kept him so long from the King in the <HI>France Comte,</HI> and made him so unable to wait on His Majesty after he did return to <HI>Paris.</HI> But so soon as he could compass it, he was pleased to acquaint His Majesty with it, and wrote to the Duke himself; and did me the Honour to write unto me also the 15<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1674. and sent his Letter by Sir <HI>William Throckmorton,</HI> who came Express upon that Errand. In these Letters he gave his <HI>R. H.</HI> fresh assurance of his most Christian Majesties Friendship, and of his Zeal and readiness to comply with every thing his <HI>R. H.</HI> had or should think fit to propose in favour of Religion, or the business of Money. And that he commanded <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI> as to the latter, to Treat and deal with his <HI>R. H.</HI> and to receive and observe his Orders and Directions, but desired that he might not at all be concerned as to the former, but that his <HI>R. H.</HI> would cause what Proposition he should think fit to be made about Religion to be offered, either to Father <HI>Ferryer,</HI> or <HI>Monsieur Pompone.</HI></P>
<P>These Letters came to us about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> and his <HI>R. H.</HI> expected daily, when <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI> should speak to him about the Subject of that Letter: But he took no notice at all of any thing till the 29<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> the evening be∣fore the King and the Duke went to <HI>Newmarket</HI> for a Fortnight, and then only said that he had Commands from his Master to give his <HI>R. H.</HI> the most firm assurance of his Friendship imaginable, or something to that purpose, making his <HI>R. H.</HI> a ge∣neral Complement, but made no mention of any particular Orders, relating to Fa∣ther <HI>Ferryer's</HI> Letter. The Duke wondring at this Proceeding, and being obliged to stay a good part of <HI>October</HI> at <HI>Newmarket,</HI> and soon after his coming back, hearing of the Death of Father <HI>Ferryer,</HI> he gave over all other further prosecuting of the former Project. But I believe, I saw <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI>'s Policy all along, who was willing to save his Masters Money upon assurance, that we would do all we could to stave off the Parliament for our own sakes, that we would struggle as hard without Money as with it. And we having by that time upon our own Interest, prevailed to get the Parliament Prorogued to the 13<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> he thought that Prorogation being to a day so high in the Spring, would put the Confederates so far beyond their measures, as that it might procure a Peace, and be as useful to <HI>France</HI> as a Dis∣solution. Upon these Reasons, I suppose he went. I had several Discourses with him and did so far open my self, to him as to say, I could wish his Master would give us, leave to offer to our Master 300000 Pounds for the Dissolution of the Parliament. And shewed him that a Peace would most certainly follow a Dissolution (which he agreed with me in) and that we desired not the Money from his Master to excite our Wills, or to make us more industrious to use our utmost Powers to procure a Dissolution, but to strengthen our Power and Credit with the King, and to render us more capable to succeed with his Majesty, as most certainly we should have done, had we been fortified with such an Argument.</P>
<P>To this purpose, I press'd <HI>Monsieur Pompone</HI> frequently by Sir <HI>William Throckmorton,</HI> who returned hence again into <HI>France,</HI> on the 10<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> the Day our Par∣liament should have met, but was Prorogued. <HI>Monsieur Pompone</HI> (as I was infor∣med
<PB N="126" REF="75"/>
by Sir <HI>William</HI>) did seem to approve the thing: But yet had two Objections against it: First, that the Sum propos'd was great, and could be very ill spar'd in the Circumstances his most Christian Majesty was in. To which we answer'd, That if by his Expending that Sum he could procure a Dissolution of our Parliament, and thereby a Peace, which every Body agreed would necessarily follow: His most Christian Majesty would gain his Ends, and save five or ten times a greater Sum, and so be a good Hus∣band by his Expence: And if we did not procure a Dissolution, he should not be at that Expence at all: For that we desired him only to promise upon that Condition, which we were content to be obliged to perform first. The second Objection was, the Duke did not move, nor appear in it himself. To that we answer'd, That he did not indeed to <HI>Monsieur Pompone,</HI> because he had found so ill an effect of the Nego∣tiation with Father <HI>Ferryer</HI> when it came into <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny's</HI> hands: But that he had concern'd himself in it to Father <HI>Ferryer.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I continued to prosecute and press the Dissolution of the Parliament, detesting all Prorogations as only so much loss of time, and a means of strengthening all those, who depend upon it in opposition to the Crown, the interest of <HI>France,</HI> and Catho∣lick Religion, in the Opinion they had taken, that our King durst not part with his Parliament, apprehending that another would be much worse. Second, that he could not live long without a Parliament, therefore they must suddenly meet: The longer he kept them off, the greater his necessity would grow, and consequently their Power to make him do what they listed, would increase accordingly. And therefore, if they could but maintain themselves a while, the Day would certainly come in a short time, in which they should be able to work their Wills. Such Discourses as these kept the Confederates, and our Male-contents in heart, and made them weather on the War in spight of all our Prorogations. Therefore I press'd (as I have said) a Dissolution until <HI>February</HI> last, when our Circumstances were so totally Changed, that we were forced to change our Councels too, and be as much for the Parliaments sitting, as we were before against it.</P>
<P>Our Change was thus; before that time the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> was the only Minister in Credit, who thought himself out of all danger of the Par∣liament: He having, been accused before them, and justified, and therefore was Zealous for their Sitting: And to increase his Reputation with them, and to become a perfect Favourite, he sets, himself all he could to Persecute the Ca∣tholick Religion and to oppose the <HI>French.</HI> To shew his Zeal against the first, he re∣vived some old dormant Orders, for prohibiting <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks to appear before the King, and put them in Execution at his first coming into his Office of Lord Cham∣berlain: And to make sure work with the Second as he thought, prevailed with the King to give him, and the Earl of <HI>Ossery</HI> (who married two Sisters of <HI>Myne Heere Odyke</HI>'s) leave to go over into <HI>Holland</HI> with the said <HI>Heere,</HI> to make a Visit as they pretended to their Relations. But indeed and in truth, to propose the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> (eldest Daughter of his Royal <HI>H.</HI>) as a Match for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>; not only without the Consent, but against the good liking of his <HI>R. H.</HI> Insomuch that the Lord <HI>Arlington's</HI> Creatures were forced to excuse him with a Distinction, that the said Lady was not to be looked upon as the Dukes Daughter, but as the Kings, and a Child of the State was, and so the Dukes Consent not much to be considered in the disposal of her, but only the interest of State. By this he intended to render himself the Dar∣ling of Parliament and Protestants, who look'd upon themselves as secured in their Religion by such an Alliance, and design'd further to draw us into a close Conjun∣ction with <HI>Holland</HI> and the Enemies of <HI>France.</HI> The Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> set forth upon this Errand the 10<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1674 and returned not till the 6<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>January</HI> following. During his absence the Lord Treasurer; Lord Keeper, and the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> who were the only Ministers of any considerable Credit with the King, and who all pretended to be entirely united to the Duke, declaimed loudly, and with great violence against the said Lord, and his Actions in <HI>Holland</HI>: And did hope in his absence to have totally supplanted him, and to have routed him out of the Kings favour. And after that, thought they might easily enough have dealt with the Par∣liament. But none of them had Courage enough to speak against the Parliament, till they could get rid of him: For fear they should not succeed, and that the Par∣liament would Sit in spight of them, and come to hear that they had used their endeavours against it. Which would have been so unpardonable a Crime with our <HI>Omnipotent Parliament,</HI> that no Power could have been able to have saved them from Punishment. But they finding at his Return that they could not prevail against him,
<PB N="127" REF="75"/>
by such Means and Arts as they had then tryed, resolved upon new Councels: Which were, to out-run him in his own Course: Which accordingly they undertook, and became as fierce Apostles, and as Zealous for Protestant Religion, and against Popery, as ever my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had been before them, and in pursuance thereof persuaded the King to issue out those severe Orders, and Proclamations against Catho∣licks, which came out in <HI>February</HI> last: By which they did as much as in them lay to extirpate all Catholicks, and Catholick Religion out of the Kingdom. Which Coun∣cels were in my poor Opinion so detestable, being levelled (as they must needs be) so directly against the Duke by People which he had advanced, and who had pro∣fessed so much Duty and Service to him, that we were put upon new thoughts, how to save his <HI>R. H.</HI> now from the deceits and snares of those Men, upon whom we formerly depended. We saw well enough, that their Design was to make them∣selves as grateful as they could to the Parliament if it must Sit; they thinking nothing so acceptable to them, as the Persecution of Popery: And yet they were so obnoxi∣ous to the Parliaments displeasure in General, that they would have been glad of any Expedient to have kept it off: Though they durst not engage against it openly themselves; but thought this Device of theirs might serve for their purposes; ho∣ping the Duke would be so alarm'd at their Proceedings, and by his being left by every Body, that he would be much more afraid of the Parliament than ever; and would use his utmost power to prevent its Sitting: Which they doubted not but he would endeavour: And they were ready enough to work underhand too for him (for their own sakes, not his) in order thereunto, but durst not appear openly: And to encourage the Duke the more to endeavour the Dissolution of the Parlia∣ment, their Creatures used to say up and down, That this Rigour against the Catho∣licks was in favour of the Duke, and to make a Dissolution of the Parliament more easie (which they knew he coveted) by obviating one great Objection which was commonly made against it, which was, That if the Parliament should be Dissol∣ved, it would be said, That it was done in favour of Popery: Which Clamour they had prevented before hand, by the Severity they had used against it.</P>
<P>Assoon as we saw these Tricks put upon us, we plainly saw what Men we had to deal withal, and what we had to trust to, if we were wholly at their mercy: But yet durst not seem so dissatisfyed as really we were, but rather magnified the Con∣trivance as a Device of great Cunning and Skill. All this we did purely, to hold them in a belief, that we would endeavour to dissolve the Parliament, and that they might rely upon his <HI>R. H.</HI> for that which we knew they long'd for, and were afraid they might do some other way, if they discovered, that we were resolved we would not. At length when he saw the Sessions secured, we declared, that we were for the Parliaments meeting, as indeed we were, from the moment we saw our selves handled by all the Kings Ministers at such a Rate, that we had reason to believe they would Sacrifice <HI>France,</HI> Religion and his <HI>R. H.</HI> too, to their own Interest, if occasion served: And that they were led to believe, that that was the only way they had to save themselves at that time. For we saw no Expedient fit to stop them in their Carreer of Persecution, and those other destructive Councels, but the Parliament: Which had set it self a long time to dislike every thing the Ministers had done, and had ap∣peared violently against Popery, whilst the Court seem'd to favour it: And there∣fore we were Confident, that the Ministers having turned their Faces, the Parlia∣ment would do so too, and still be against them: And be as little for Persecution then as they had been for Popery before. This I undertook to mannage for the Duke and the King of <HI>France</HI>'s interest: And assured <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI> (which I am sure he will testifie, if occasion serves) that that Sessions should do neither of them any hurt: For that I was sure I had Power enough to prevent mischief: though I durst not engage for any good they would do: Because I had but very few Assistances to carry on the Work; and wanted those Helps which others had, of making Friends. The <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spaniard</HI> spared no Pains, or expence of Money to animate as many as they could against <HI>France:</HI> Our Lord Treasurer, Lord Keeper, all the Bishops, and such as called themselves Old Cavaliers (who were all then as one Man) were not less industrious against Popery, and had the Purse at their Girdle too: Which is an excellent Instrument to gain Friends with, and all united against the Duke as Patron both of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Catholick</HI> Religion. To deal with all this Force, we had no Money but what came from a few private hands: And those so mean ones too, that I dare venture to say, that I spent more my particular self out of my own Fortune, and
<PB N="128" REF="76"/>
upon my single Credit, then all the whole Body of Catholicks in <HI>England</HI> besides: Which was so inconsiderable in Comparison of what our Adversaries commanded, and we verily believe did bestow in making their Party, that it is not worth mentioning. Yet notwithstanding all this we saw, that by the help of the Non-conformists as Presbyterians, Independants, and other Sects (who were as much afraid of Per∣secution as our selves) and of the Enemies of the Ministers, and particularly of the Treasurer, who by that time had supplanted the Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> and was grown sole Manager of all Affairs himself, we sheuld be very able to prevent what they de∣sign'd against us, and so render the Sessions ineffectual to their Ends, though we might not be able to Compass our own: Which were, to make some brisk step in fa∣vour of his <HI>R. H.</HI> to shew the King that his Majesties Affairs in Parliament were not obstructed by reason of any Aversion they had to his <HI>R. H.</HI> Person, or Apprehensions they had of him or his Religion: But from Faction and Ambition in some, and from a real Dissatisfaction in others, that we have not had such Fruits and good Effects of of those great Sums of Money which have been formerly given, as was expected. If we could then have made but one such step, the King would certainly have re∣stored his <HI>R. H.</HI> to all his Commissions: Upon which he would have been much greater than ever yet he was in his whole Life, or could probably ever have been by any other Course in the World, than what he had taken of becoming Catholick <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And we were so very near gaining this Point, that I did humbly beg his <HI>R. H</HI> to give me leave to put the Parliament upon making an Address to the King, that His Majesty would be pleased to put the Fleet into the hands of his <HI>R H.</HI> as the only Person likely to give a good Account of so important a Charge as that was to the Kingdom, and shewed his <HI>R. H.</HI> such Reasons to perswade him that we could carry it, that he agreed with me in it, that he believ'd we could. Yet others tell∣ing him, how great a damage it would be to him, if he should miss in such an undertaking (which for my part I could not then see, nor do I yet) he was pre∣vail'd upon not to venture, though he was perswaded he could carry it. I did Communicate this Design of mine to <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny,</HI> who agreed with me, that it would be the greatest advantage imaginable to his Master, to have the Dukes Power and Credit so far advanced as this would certainly do, if we could Compass it: I shew'd him all the Difficulty we were like to meet with, and what Helps we should have: But that we should want one very material one; Money to carry on the Work as we ought: And therefore I do Confess, I did shamefully beg his Masters help, and would willingly have been in everlasting Disgrace with all the World, if I had not with that Assistance of twenty thousand Pounds sterling, (which per∣haps is not the tenth part of what was spent on the other side) made it evident to the Duke that he could not have missed it. <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI> used to tell me, that if he could be sure of succeeding in that Design, his Master would give a very much larger Sum: But that he was not in a Condition to throw away Money upon un∣certainties. I answered, That nothing of that Nature could be so infallibly sure, as not to be subject to some Possibilities of failing; but that I durst venture to under∣take to make it evident, that there was as great an assurance of succeeding in it as any Husbandman can have of a Crop in Harvest, who sowes his Gound in its due Season, and yet it would be counted a very imprudent piece of wariness in any body to scruple the ventring so much seed in its proper time, because it is possible▪ it may be totally lost, and no benefit of it found in Harvest. He that minds the Winds and the Rains at that rate, shall neither Sow nor Reap. I take our Case to be much the same as it was the last Sessions. If we can ad∣vance the Dukes Interest one step forward, we shall put him out of the step of Chance for ever: For he makes such a Figure already that cautious Men do not care to Act against him, not always without him, because they do not see that he is much out-power'd by his Enemies. Yet is he not at such a pitch as to be quite out of danger, or free from Opposition. But if he could gain any consi∣derable new addition of Power, all would come over to him as to the only stedy Centre of our Government, and no body would contend with him further. Then would <HI>Catholics</HI> be at rest, and his most Christian Majesty's Interest secured with us in <HI>England</HI> beyond all Apprehensions whatsoever.</P>
<P>In Order to this, we have two great designs to attempt this next Sessions. First that which we were about before, <HI>viz.</HI> To put the Parliament upon making it their hum∣ble request to the King that the Fleet may be put into his R. H<HI>'s.</HI> care. Secondly,
<PB N="129" REF="76"/>
to get an Act for general Liberty of Conscience. If we carry these two, or either of them, we shall in effect, do what we list afterwards: And truly we think we do not undertake these great points very unreasonably, but that we have good Cards for our Game: Not but that we expect great opposition, and have great reason to beg all the Assistance we can possibly get; and therefore if his most Christian Majesty would stand by us a little in this Conjuncture and help us with such a Sum as 20000 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> (which is no very great Matter to Venture upon such an undertaking as this) I would be content to be Sacrificed to the utmost Malice of my Enemies, if I did not succeed. I have proposed this, several times to Monsieur <HI>Rouvigny,</HI> who seemed always of my Opinion; and has often told me that he has writ into <HI>France</HI> upon this Subject, and has desired me to do the like. But I know not whether he will be as Zealous in that point as a <HI>Catholic</HI> would be; because our prevailing in these things would give the greatest blow to the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> here, that ever it received since its Birth, which perhaps he would not be very glad to see; especially when he believes there is another way of doing his Masters business well enough without it: Which is by a Dissolu∣tion of the Parliament, upon which I know he mightily depends, and concludes that if that comes to be Dissolved, it will be as much as he needs care for, proceeding perhaps upon the same manner of Discourse, which he had this time twelve Months. But with submission to his better Judgment; I do think that our Case is extreamly much altered to what it was, in relation to a Dissolution, for then the Body of our Governing Ministers (all but the Earl of <HI>Arlington)</HI> were intirely United to the Duke and would have govern'd his way, if they had been free from all fear and controul, as they had been if the Parliament had been removed.</P>
<P>But they having since that time engaged in quite different Councels, and Embarkt themselves and Interests upon other Bottoms, having declared themselves against <HI>Popery, &amp;c.</HI> To dissolve the Parliament simply and without any other step made, will be to leave them to Govern what way they list, which we have reason to suspect, will be to the prejudice of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Catholic Religion.</HI> And their late Declarations and Actions have Demonstrated to us that they take that for the most popular way for themselves, and likliest to keep them in absolute Power. Whereas if the Duke should once get above them (after the Tricks they have plaid with him) they are not sure he will totally forget the usage, he has had at their hands. Therefore it imports us now to advance our Interest a little further by some such Project as I have named, before we dissolve the Parliament: Or else perhaps we shall but change Masters (a Parliament for Ministers) and continue still in the same Slavery and Bondage as before. But one such step as I have proposed, being well made, we may safely see them Dissolved, and not fear the Ministers; but shall be Established and stand firm without any Opposition; for every body will then come over to us and worship the Rising Sun.</P>
<P>I have here given you the History of three years, as short as I could, though I am affraid it will seem very long and troublesome to your Reverence, among the mul∣titude of affairs you are concern'd in. I have also shewn you the present State of our Case, which may (by Gods providence and good Conduct) be made of such advantage to Gods Church, that for my part I can scarce believe my self awake, or the thing real, when I think on a Prince in such an Age as we live in, converted to such a degree of Zeal and Piety as not to regard any thing in the World in compa∣rison of <HI>God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The bringing in <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Superstition,</HI> the invading of Liberty and Property, and the inslaving the Nation.</NOTE> <HI>Almighties Glory, the Salvation of his own Soul, and the Conversion of our poor Kingdom</HI>: Which has been a long time opprest and miserably harrast with Heresie and Schism. I doubt not but your Reverence will consider our Case, and take it to heart, and afford us what help you can, both with the King of Heaven, by your Holy Prayers and with his most Christian Majesty, by that great Credit which you most justly have with him. And if ever his Majesties affairs (or your own) can ever want the Service of so inconsiderable a Creature as my self, you shall never find any Body rea∣dier to Obey your Commands, or faithfuller in the Execution of them to the best of his power, than</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Copy of the Letter Written to <HI>Monsieur Le Chese</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Kings Confessor, which Mr. <HI>Coleman</HI> confessed, he himself wrote and Counterfeited in the Dukes Name.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oleman's <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ryal,</HI> p. 66.</NOTE>THe second of <HI>June</HI> last past, his most Christian Majesty offered me most generously his Friendship, and the use of his Purse, to the Assistance against the Designs of my Enemies and his, and protested unto me, that his interest, and mine were so closely link'd together, that those that oppose the one should be lookt upon as Ene∣mies to the other; and told me moreover, his Opinion of my Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and the Parliament which is, that he is of Opinion, that neither the one nor the other is in his Interest or mine: And thereupon he desired me to make such propositions as I should think fit in this conjuncture.</P>
<P>All was transacted by the means of Father <HI>Ferrier,</HI> who made use of Sir <HI>William Throgmorton,</HI> who is an honest Man, and of truth, who was then at <HI>Paris,</HI> and hath held correspondence with <HI>Coleman,</HI> one of my Family, in whom I have great confi∣dence.</P>
<P>I was much satisfied to see his most Christian Majesty altogether of my Opinion, so I made him Answer the 29<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> by the same means he made use of to write to me, that is by <HI>Coleman,</HI> who addrest himself to Father <HI>Ferrier</HI> (by the Forementioned Knight) and entirely agreed to his most Christian Majesty as well to what had re∣spect to the Union of our Interest, as the unusefulness of my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and the Parliament in order to the Service of the King my Brother, and his most Christian Majesty; and that it was necessary to make use of our joynt and utmost Credits to prevent the success of those evil designs, resolved on by the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and the Parliament, against his most Christian Majesty and my self, which of my side I pro∣mise really to perform, of which, since that time, I have given reasonable good proof.</P>
<P>Moreover, I made some proposals, which I thought necessary to bring to pass what we were obliged to undertake, assuring him, that nothing could so firmly establish our Interest with the King my Brother, as that very same offer of the help of his Purse, by which means I had much reason to hope I should be enabled to perswade to this Dissolving of the Parliament, and to make void the designs of my Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who works incessantly to advance the Interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and to lessen that of the King your Master, notwithstanding all the protestations he hath made to this hour to render him Service.</P>
<P>But as that which was proposed was at a stand by reason of the sickness of Father <HI>Ferrier,</HI> so our affairs succeeded not according to our designs, only Father <HI>Ferrier</HI> wrote to me, the 15<HI>th.</HI> of the last Month, that he had Communicated those pro∣positions to his most Christian Majesty, and that they had been very well liked of; but as they contained things that had regard to the <HI>Catholic Religion,</HI> and to the of∣fer and use of his Purse, he gave me to understand he did not desire I should Treat with <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI> upon the first, but as to the last, and had the same time acquaint∣ed me, that <HI>Monsieur Rouvigny</HI> had order to grant me whatsoever the conjuncture of our affairs did require; and have expected the effects of it to this very hour: But nothing being done in it, and seeing on the other hand that my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and several others endeavoured by a thousand deceits to break the good Intelligence which is between the King my Brother, his most Christian Majesty, and my self, to the end they might deceive us all three, I have thought fit to advertise you of all that is past, and desire of you your assistance and friendship to prevent the Rogueries of those, who have no other design then to betray the concerns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and who by their pretended Service, are the occasion they succeed not.</P>
<P>As to any thing more I refer you to Sir <HI>William Throgmorton</HI> and <HI>Coleman,</HI> whom I have commanded to give an Account of the whole State of our affair, and of the true condition of <HI>England,</HI> with many others, and principally my Lord <HI>Arlington's</HI> en∣deavours to represent to you quite otherwise then it is.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Sent your Reverence a tedious long Letter on our 29<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coleman's <HI>Tryal,</HI> p. 68.</NOTE> to inform you of the Progress of affairs for these two or three last years. I having now again the opportunity of a very sure hand to conveigh this by, I have sent you a Cipher, because our Parliament now drawing on, I may possibly have occasion to send you something, which you may be willing enough to know, and may be necessa∣ry for us that you should, when we may want the conveniency of a Messenger: When any thing occurs of more concern other than which may not be fit to be trusted even to a Cipher alone; I will, to make such a thing more secure write in Limon between the lines of a Letter, which shall have nothing in it visible, but what I care not who sees, but dryed by a warm Fire, shall discover what is written; so that if the Letter comes to your hands and upon drying it any thing appears, more then did before, you may be sure no Body has seen it by the way. I will not trou∣ble you with that way of writing, but upon special occasions, and then I will give you a hint to direct you to look for it, by concluding my visible Letter with some∣thing of Fire or Burning, by which mark you may please to know, that there is something underneath, and how my Letter is to be used to find it out.</P>
<P><HI>We have hear a mighty Work upon our Hands, no less then the Conversion of three Kingdoms and by that perhaps the utter subduing of a <HI>Pestileat Heresie,</HI> which has domineered over great part of this Nothern World a long time, there were never such hopes of success since the Death of our Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>as now in our days when God has given us a Prince, who is become, may I say a Miracle, zealous of being the Author and Instrument of so glorious a Work; but the opposition we are sure to meet with, is also alike to be great.</HI> So that it imports us to get all the Aid and Assistance we can, for the Harvest is great, and the Labourers but few, that which we rely upon most next to God Almighty's providence, and the favour of my Master the Duke, is the mighty mind of his most Christian Majesty, whose generous Soul in∣clines him to great undertakings, which being managed by your Reverence's exem∣plary Piety and Prudence, will certainly make him look upon this as most suitable to himself, and best becoming his Power and thoughts, so that I hope you will pardon me if I be very troublesome to you upon this occasion, from whom I expect the great∣est help we can hope for; I must confess, I think his Christian Majesties Temporal Interest is so much attracted to that of his R. H. (which can never be considerable, but upon the growth and advancement of the Catholic Religion) that his Ministers cannot give him better advice, even in a Politic Sence, abstracting from the considerati∣ons of the next World, that of our Blessed Lord, to seek first the Kingdom of Hea∣ven, and the Righteousness thereof, that all other things may be added unto him: That I know his most Christian Majesty has more powerful motives suggested to him by his own devotion, and your Reverences zeal for Gods Glory, to engage him to afford us the best help he can in our present circumstances, but we are a little unhappy in this, that we cannot press his Majesty by his present Minister here upon these latter Arguments (which are most strong) but only upon the first, Mr. <HI>Rouvigny</HI>'s sence and ours differing very much upon them, though we agree perfectly upon the rest. And indeed, though he be a very able Man as to his Masters Service in things where Religion is not concerned, yet I believe it were much more happy (con∣sidering the posture he is now in) and his temper were of such a sort, that we might deal clearly with him throughout, and not be forced to stop short in a discourse of Con∣sequence, and leave the most material part out, because we know it will shock his particular Opinion; and so perhaps meet with dislike and Opposition, though never so necessary to the main concern. I am afraid we shall find too much reason for this Complaint in this next Session of Parliament, for had we had one here from his most Christian Majesty, who had taken the whole business to Heart, and who would have
<PB N="132" REF="78"/>
represented the State of our Case truly as it is, to his Master; I do not doubt but his most Christian Majesty would have engaged himself further in the affair then at present I fear he has done, and by his approbation have given such Councels as have been offered to his R. H. by those few <HI>Catholics,</HI> who have access to him, and who are bent to serve him and advance the <HI>Catholic Religion</HI> with all their might, and might have more Credit with his R. H. then I fear they have found, and have assist∣ed them also with his Purse as far as 10000. Crowns or some such Sum (which to him is very inconsiderable but would have been to them of greater use than can be imagined) towards gaining others to help them, or at least not to oppose them. If we had been so happy as to have had his most Christian Majesty with us to this Degree; I would have answered with my Life for such success this Sessions, as would have put the Interest of the <HI>Catholic Religion,</HI> his R. H. and his most Christian Maje∣sty out of all Danger for the time to come. But wanting those helps of re∣commending those necessary Councels, which have been given his Royal High∣ness in such manner as to make him think them worth his accepting, and fit to Govern himself by, and of those advantages which a little Mony well ma∣naged would have gained us; I am afraid we shall not be much better at the end of this Sessions then we are now; I pray God we do not loose ground. By my next, which will be er'e long, I shall be able to tell your Reverence more particularly what we are like to expect.</P>
<P>In the mean time I most humbly beg your <HI>Holy Prayers</HI> for all our under∣takings, and that you will be pleased to Honour me so far, as to esteem me what I am entirely and without any reserve.</P>

<HEAD>The Narrative of Sir <HI>Francis North,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> at the Council-board.</HEAD>
<P><Q>AT my first coming to Mr. <HI>Rumsey</HI>'s House, where I was to Lodge at <HI>Bristol,</HI> upon <HI>Monday</HI> the 16th day of <HI>August</HI> in the Afternoon, being the first day of the Assizes, Sir <HI>John Knight</HI> came to me, and said, That Mr. <HI>Bedlow</HI> lay dangerously ill of a Fever, and had little hopes of Life, and desired that I would give him a

Visit, that he might impart something of great consequence to me before his death.</Q> I told him I would give him a Visit that Night after Supper, about Nine a Clock, if I might be satisfied of two things, first that there was no infection in his distemper; Se∣condly, that the time would not be inconvenient, but he might discourse to me with∣out prejudice to his Condition. After a little while, two Physitians came to me, and assured me, that there was no danger of Infection, and that the time I had appointed would be most proper; for commonly he took his repose in the Afternoon, and at nine a Clock, he would, in all probability, be refreshed, and fit to Discourse with me: thereupon I declared my resolution of going, and desired the company of the two Sheriffs, and my Brother <HI>Roger North,</HI> and appointed my Marshal <HI>William Janes</HI> to go with me to him. As we were upon the way, Mr. <HI>Crossman,</HI> a Minister in that City, told me <HI>Mr. Bedlow</HI> had desired him to come with me to him. I said it was very well, and I should be glad of his Company, whereupon we went altogether; and being come into the Room where <HI>Mr. Bedlow</HI> lay, I saluted him, and said, I was extream sorry to find him so ill; I came to visit him upon his own desires, I did imagine he had some∣thing to impart to me as a Privy Counsellor, and therefore if he thought fit, the Com∣pany might withdraw. He told me that needed not yet, for he had much to say, which was proper for the Company to hear, and having saluted the Sheriffs, and <HI>Mr. Crossman,</HI> he discoursed to this purpose.</P>
<P>That he looked upon himself, as a dying man, and found within him∣self that he could not last long, but must shortly appear before the Lord of Hosts, to give an account of all his actions: and because many Persons had made it their business to baffle and deride the Plot, he did, for the satisfaction of the World, there declare upon the Faith of a dying Man, and as he hoped for Sal∣vation, that <HI>whatever he had testifyed concerning the</HI> Plot, <HI>was true.</HI> And that <HI>he had wronged no Man by his Testimony, but had testifyed rather under that over what was truth. That he had nothing lay upon his Conscience upon that account.</HI> That he should appear chearfully before the Lord of Hosts, which he did ve∣rily believe he must do in a short time. He said, he had many Witnesses to pro∣duce, who would make the Plot as clear as the Sun, and he had other things to discover, which were of great importance to the King and the Country. Hereupon he making some pause, I told him, the Plot was so evidently made out, that no reasonable Man, no Protestant, I was sure, could doubt of the Truth of it, but he ought not to have concealed any thing that concerned the King so highly, he ought to discover his whole knowledge in Matters of Treason, that Traytors may be apprehended and secured; who otherwise may have opportunity to execute their Treasonable Designs. To this he reply'd, that much of that which he had not discovered, was to coroborate his former Testimony; that he had concealed nothing that was necessary to the Kings preservation. That he thought it not fit to accuse more Persons, till he had ended with those whom he had already accused: He expressed great grief and trouble at the the Condition of this poor King and Country (so he termed them) whom he knew, at that time, to be in eminent Danger from the Jesuites, who had resolved the Kings death; and he was sure they would spare him no longer then he continued to be kind to them; he said, he was privy to their Consultations at <HI>Salamanca</HI> and <HI>Valadolid,</HI> where they used to observe the favourable Conjuncture they had to intro∣duce their Religion into <HI>England,</HI> which consisted in their having a <HI>Head,</HI> he must be set up what ever came of it, and if they let slip that opportunity, they should ne∣ver have such another, for without a <HI>Head</HI> they could do nothing, he said further, he knew the wickedness and resolution of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> they stuck at nothing to compass their own ends, they had attempted to poison him, but he had escaped.</P>
<P>When he had finished this Discourse (which lasted about a quarter of an hour) I asked him if the Company should not withdraw, and he said yes, and ordered his Nurses to go out, and only his Wife to stay to tend him. And thereupon all went out saving Mrs. <HI>Bedlow</HI> and my self, and my Servant <HI>William Janes</HI>; then I told him, I thought it convenient, that what he should then say unto me, should be upon Oath; he replyed, that it was necessary it should be so; and called for a Bible, but my Ser∣vant having brought a Book with him, administred the Oath to him, and laying his Pa∣per upon a Chair by the Bed-side, writ down his Deposition as he delivered it.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="79"/>When Mr. <HI>Bedlow</HI> had concluded and said, That was all he had to inform me of, I took the Paper, and read it over distinctly to him and he approved it, and signed it laying the Paper upon a Pillow.</P>
<P>I thought it not fit, considering his Condition to perplex him with Questions, but took his Information as he offered it, and held no discourse with him, when the Com∣pany was withdrawn, but concerning the true setting down his Depositions, and when he seemed to be weary, to mind him of taking Cordials, which his Wife reach∣ed to him as he desired them.</P>
<P>The next day Mr. <HI>Bedlow</HI>'s Brother came to me, and told me that his Brother de∣sired a Copy of the Deposition he made before me. But I told him, I had well considered it, and could not give him a Copy without the Kings leave. But I would move the King in it, and if he gave leave I would take care to send one to him. And Mr. <HI>Bedlow</HI>'s Brother then told me, That it was his Brothers desire, that I should represent to his Majesty his Condition and that his Sickness was very chargable, and move his Majesty on his behalf for some supply of Money for his Subsistance, which I promised to do.</P>
<P>This is all that I can recollect of what passed upon this Occasion, and is in sub∣stance true, but the very Words, or the Order, I cannot positively remember.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Right Honourable Sir <HI>Lyonel Jenkins</HI> One of His Majesties Principal Secretaries of State.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Always intended to write from hence, to pay my thanks for the whole Circuit which was much more pleasant, by your Favour of holding Correspondence with me. But now I have business of some Importance, for as I soon as I came to this City, I received a Message from Mr. <HI>Bedlow</HI> by Sir <HI>John Knight,</HI> that he, be∣ing very ill, and in the Judgment of Physitians, in great danger of Death, had some business of great moment to impart to me. I knowing the Man, and the Season, would not refuse the pains to give him a Visit: and being satisfied by Physitians that there was no Contagious quality in his Distemper, (though I did not much fear it) I went well accompanied, and in the presence of the Company he declared, that <HI>what he had said relating to the Plot was true; and be being a dying Man had nothing lay upon his Conscience upon that score.</HI> The greatest trouble he had, was the danger the King (whom he loved above all things) was in from the Papists at this time, who would attempt his Life as soon as ever he should cease to be kind to them: and many other expressions of this kind. After this I asked, if he had any thing to impart to me in private, he told me he had, and having made the Company withdraw, all but my Clark, I took the inclosed Examination upon Oath, you may imagine I was not curious to perplex him with Questions; I took it just as he delivered it, of what signification it will be, I leave to wiser Men, I think my duty is to send it to you, that you may inform his Majesty of the truth. I shall wait upon you at <HI>Windsor</HI> upon <HI>Sunday</HI> next, to receive your further Commands,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="135" REF="79"/>And now the Truth of this is thus confirmed by as strong Testimony as can well be given, the first part of it, premeditated Letters of one of the Conspirators themselves, nay the chiefest, those Letters owned and acknowledeged by him to be his own Writing, and he after¦wards fairly tryed, legally convicted and condemned, and afterwards justly executed for the Treason; The other, <HI>verba morientis,</HI> which have always weight, unless they be dilivered Men who, 'tis known, think it meritorious to dye with a falsehood in their Mouth, when 'tis to serve the interest of the Church whereof they profess to dye Members; I say, the Truth of this being thus apparent, there certainly needs no other ground, or rea∣son to be given for the making the 30. <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>ca.</HI> 1. <HI>for excluding Papists from sitting in either House of Parliament,</HI> especially if it be considered, how much they, by being at Court, and sitting in Parliament in the precedent Reigns had interrupted the Prote∣stants in the measures they designed to take for their own preservation; which things were examined into upon the discovery of this Plot, and therefore it appeared abso∣lutely necessary to exclude them both the Court and the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Preamble of the Act and the Substance of the Enacting Part, take as follow∣eth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>FOR, as much as divers good Laws have been made for preventing the increase and danger of Popery in this Kingdom, which have not had the desired effects,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>30. Car. c. 1.</HI> An Act for ex∣cluding the Pa∣pists the Par∣liament.</NOTE> <HI>by reason of the free access which Popish Recusants have had to his Majesties Court, and by reason of the Liberty, which of late some of the Recusants have had and taken, to sit and vote in Parliament. Wherefore for the safety of his Majesties Royal Person and Government,</HI> It was Enacted, <HI>that from the first day of</HI> December 1678. <HI>No Member of the House of Peers or Commons should vote or sit in either House after the Speaker was chose, till every such Peer or Member had first taken the several Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and made, subscribed and credibly repeated the Declaration following.</HI></P>
<Q><P>I <HI>A. B.</HI> do solemnly and sincerely in the presence of God profess, testifie and declare, that I do believe that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, there is not any Tran∣substantiation of the Elements of the Bread and Wine, into the Body and Blood of Christ, at or after the Consecration thereof by any Person whatsoever, and that the Invocation or Adoration of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> or any other Saint, and the Sacrifice of the Mass, as they are now used in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are Superstitious and Idolatrous. And I do solemnly in the presence of God, profess, testify and declare, that I do make this Declaration and every part thereof, in the plain and ordinary sence of the Words read unto me, as they are commonly understood by <HI>English</HI> Protestants, without any evasion, equivocation or mental reservation whatsoever, and without any dispensation already granted me for this purpose by the Pope, or any other Authority or Person whatsoever, or without any hope of any such dispensation from any Person or Autho∣rity whatsoever, or without thinking that I am, or can be, acquitted before God or Man or absolved of this Declaration, or any Part thereof, although the Pope or any other Person or Persons, or Power whatsoever, should dispence with or annul the same, or declare that it was null and void from the beginning.</P></Q>
<P><HI>The same Oaths and Declarations to be made in every succeeding Parliament in full House, that all members of Parliament not swearing and declaring as afore∣said, and Popish Recusants convict, are forbidden the Kings and Queens presence, That if any Member of the House of Peers or Commons, do any thing contrary to this Act, or shall offend in any of the Cases aforesaid, such Member should be thenceforth judged a Popish Recusant Convict, and should be disabled to hold or execute any Office in any of his Majesties Dominions, and likewise to sit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote in either House of Parliament, or make his Proxy in the House of Peers, or in prosecute any suit in Law or Equity, or to be Guardian to a Child, or Executor or Administrator to any Person, and uncapable of any Legacy, Deed or Gift, and should fofeit for every willful offence against this Act the sum of Five hundred Pounds to be recovered by whomsoever would sue for the same, and to be prosecuted in any of his Majesties Courts, where no Essoin, Protection or Wager of Law should lye, that either House of Parliament may cause any of their Mem∣bers to swear and subscribe as aforesaid, and upon their sitting without taking the same, they should be adjudged disabled in Law to all intents whatsoever, to sit or vote in the said Houses during that Parliament. That the Places of Members of
<PB N="136" REF="80"/>
the House of Commons disabled to vote should be void, and new Writs issue out for new Elections, that the King and Queens sworn Servants should swear as afore∣said, and subscribe the Declaration, and that if after refusal of the same, they presumed to come into their Majesties presence, they should be disabled to hold any place, and incur the Penalties aforesaid. Nothing contained in this Act to relate to the Subjects of the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>being in the Queen Dowagers service, not exceeding the number of eighteen at one time. That during the taking the Oaths all proceedings in Parliament should cease, and the Oaths,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and Names of the Persons who should take them, should be entred in Parchment Rolls, and for every such entry not above the sum of Twelve pence to be paid. This Act not to extend to such who come into the King or Queens presence, being Licensed by six Privy-Counsellors, upon some urgent occasion therein to be expressed, and such License not to exceed Ten days at a time, and not above Thirty days in a Year: That all offenders against this Act, that shall take the said Oaths,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall be dis∣charged and freed from all Penalties and Incapacities incurred thereby, but such freedom and discharge not to extend to restore any such person to any office or place filled upon voidance by this Act, nor to any other Officer till after the Expiration of one Year from taking the said Oath,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>nor to discarge the said forfeiture of Five hundred Pounds as aforesaid, nothing in this Act to extend to the then Duke of</HI> York.</P></Q>
<P>Thus I have given an Historical Account of the making of these Laws, and of the Laws themselves; and as they were highly reasonable in their Making; so certainly it is as highly reasonable to continue them, if the attemps of the Popish party under King <HI>James</HI> the Second be duly weighed: which were carried so far, that the Protestant Religion had been inevitably destroyed with the Professors thereof, had not we been redeemed out of their hands by the <HI>Conduct</HI> and <HI>Valour</HI> of his present Majesty, to whom (under God) we owe our Deliverance; and therefore can never sufficiently ex∣press our gratitude. He hath given sufficient Testimony of his Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and therefore it is reasonable to believe, that he will readily concur to the Making any Laws, that shall be thought fit to preserve it, I know of but one; and that is Castration, of all Priests and Jesuites when ever they are found here, and breeding up the Children of Papists in the Protestant Religion. Which I humbly offer to the Consi∣deration of the Parliament, for I believe this will terrify them more than Gallows or Galleys.</P>
<P>And how necessary it is for this Kingdom, to rid themselves of this Vermin every one sees, but they that are either Papists, or so blinded, with hopes or expectations of the late Kings return, that they neither can nor will see.</P>
<P>And now, methinks I hear <HI>some</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> tell me; I have shewn the rea∣sonableness of the Laws against the Papists, but have not said one word in vindication of the Laws against the Dissenters, who have been as violent against the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> as ever the Papists were, and the Laws against them are equally as just.</P>
<P>To this I give this Answer, that I ways alwas of Opinion, that the differences between the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Dissenters, have been made and carried on by the Pa∣pists. And I wish there were not too much truth in it, that the Papists influenced the Coun∣sels when the Laws were made against the Dissenters: I am sure a very Learned Pen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Sherlock.</NOTE> of the Church <HI>England</HI> own'd the putting them in severe Execution the last seven or eight years to have proceeded from Popish Councils. And I doubt not but the severe usage of the Church of <HI>England</HI> by the Dissenters, when in Power, was promoted by the same Party. Since therefore the Papists can transform themselves into all shapes to promote differences amongst Protestants; in order to their Ruine; it can't certainly but be honest Policy, for the Protestants, in order to the preservation of the whole, to unite against them as the common Enemy. And therefore as we, who are Lawyers, never love to go to Law, especially with one another; so the Protestants in <HI>England,</HI> under the denomination of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and Dissenter, being now pret∣ty even as to severities on both hands, let them no more quarrel, but shake hands and be friends, which will tend more to the preservation of the true Religion amongst us than all the Laws that can be made.</P>
