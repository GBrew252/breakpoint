Emperours of <HI>Rome,</HI> whe∣ther they were Originaries there, or Forraigners, they according to the re∣port of <HI>Aymoynus, Ado,</HI> and other Hi∣storians, had for an intervall of time ceased to be governed by Kings, being contented to be ruled by Dukes, untill such time that they had a desire to re∣turne to their manner and custome, be∣ing incited thereto by the example of other Nations; in so much that upon a mature deliberation, they concluded their Election upon <HI>Pharamond</HI> for their King, by reason that over and above the vertues resplendent in him, he was the last Sonne of their latest Duke <HI>Marco∣mire,</HI> who was Duke of <HI>Franconia,</HI> or <HI>East France,</HI> whom <HI>Stilico</HI> had confi∣ned as an Exulant in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> from the yeare of our Lord 395.</P>
<P>The time of his Election hath not beene precisely recorded by any Histo∣rians; the Moderne Authors also agree not upon the certainty and number of the yeares of his Reigne: For some
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<HI>German</HI> Chronicles accompt but 7, o∣thers 9, <HI>Onuphrius</HI> 14, but almost all the <HI>French</HI> Annalists following <HI>Sigebert,</HI> a∣gree upon 10. or 12. yeares, which they begin at the yeare of Grace, 419, or 420.</P>
<P>The <HI>French-men</HI> then estated him in the Castle of <HI>Dispargun,</HI> which was, ac∣cording to <HI>Gregory,</HI> in <HI>Tongry</HI> or <HI>Turin∣gia,</HI> on that side the <HI>Rhine,</HI> where hee made his residence, or rather in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> without an intent of enlarging his command any farther, studying onely to institute and found the King∣dome with good policy, and the Lawes called <HI>Ripuary</HI> and <HI>Salique,</HI> by reason the <HI>French</HI> inhabiting for the most part upon the River of <HI>Sals,</HI> (which disgor∣geth it selfe into the <HI>Mein,</HI> a great and famous River of <HI>Germany</HI>) were called <HI>Salians,</HI> and their principall City <HI>Sel∣gestadt,</HI> which peradventure might seeme to derive its nomination from <HI>Salagast,</HI> who was a chiefe Founder thereof. <HI>Pharamond</HI> lastly comming to
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
the period of his life, left the succession to his Son <HI>Clodion, Anno Domini</HI> 430. His Character of life is drawne in these Lineaments; he made good Lawes, and conformed the <HI>French</HI> to the obedience of civill government; revived the <HI>Sa∣lique</HI> Lawes, and was the Founder of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy: his Name <HI>Wara∣mond</HI> or <HI>Pharamond,</HI> imported a true mouth, Truth being a noble vertue in a Prince. The Church was then happy in those Lights of Religion, <HI>Jerome, Chrysostome, Ambrose,</HI> and <HI>Augustine,</HI> shining through the Clouds of Oppres∣sion, wherewith those times were dark∣ned and obscured: And the Papacy was then but weake in power, after∣ward growing strong by the Emperors absence, warring against the <HI>Barbari∣ans,</HI> and by succouring afflicted Chri∣stians.</P>

<P>This King was fortunate in his Warres, for after the Death of <HI>Aetia,</HI> executed by the Emperour <HI>Valentini∣ans</HI> command, being so faithfull a ser∣vant, that it was said that the Empe∣rour had cut off his right hand with his left: by valour, potency, and oppor∣tunity hee advanced the Monarchy of <HI>France,</HI> growing more exact and com∣pleate in strength, hee being the third Stone in that Royall building called <HI>Gaule,</HI> which new-begun Estate was raised to a greater perfection by many other Royall Builders, descended from his Race, and called <HI>Merovin∣gieres,</HI> in memory of this <HI>Merovee,</HI> who, as <HI>Titus Vespasian</HI> said, <HI>Non per∣didi</HI>

<P>In the interim, King <HI>Aribert</HI> de∣ceased the seventh yeare of his reigne, leaving a sonne called <HI>Chilperic,</HI> who survived him but few dayes, of whose death <HI>Dagobert</HI> was strongly suspect∣ed.

<P>The Character of this King may bee thus drawne: He was better furnished with vertue than his education promi∣sed: he strained the Kingdome by Iu∣stice, and brought it to moderation, and obedience; the state thereof be∣ingtoo much slackned by his fathers le∣nity, and as he had tun'd the govern∣ment to yeeld a vertuous harmony, he grew into the opinion of his Sub∣jects, by his affection to Piety, which he made to shine most cleare and evi∣dent, by building and enriching many Temples, especially St. <HI>Denis,</HI> honour'd since by being the constant Sepulchre where the Kings of <HI>France</HI> lye buried. He banished also the <HI>Iewes</HI> out of his Territories. But these resplendant ver∣tues
<PB N="48" REF="30"/>
were darkened and disgraced by the foule sinne of Adultery, whereby he grew infamous to his Subjects and Strangers, and was so confirmed in this vice, that <HI>Anand</HI> Bishop of <HI>Paris</HI> perswading his Conversion, was therefore banished. But his reason was awaked by <HI>Pepius</HI> constant repre∣hension, to whom banishment being threatned, yet he persisted, and by a brave importunity, neglecting his owne danger, obtained of the King to bee mercifull unto himselfe, and forsake his sinne; such was the minde of this vertuous Prince to hearken to the words of a wise man which were spoken in season, that ever after he was wary both of his words &amp; actions; lea∣vingan example of loyalty in a servant, and of Reasons victory in a Prince.</P>

themselves: making Warres, Peace, Al∣liances, Ordinances and Customes of the Kingdome at their pleasure.

<P>Hee may be reckoned among those Kings that were living Pictures of So∣veraignty, shewed every yeare to the people, and so put up againe into his Chamber: but if Vertue be active, and consists in doing good, how could Kings thinke that they might rule by their Deputies?

Duke of <HI>Frizeland,</HI> who was as yet a Pagan and an Idolater; so that he being overthrowne, <HI>Pepin</HI> would not grant him any conditions of peace, unlesse he would permit a Monke called <HI>Wilebros, (aliâs) Clement,</HI> a learned and vertuous man, might freely give instructions to the <HI>Frizons</HI> in the Christian Religion; which for the most part was generally approved and liked by the people: but the Nobles and chiefe men remained and continued in their ancient errour together with their Prince.

<HI>Alpaide</HI> was so much enraged, that shee instigated her brother <HI>Dodon</HI> to kill him: but he and his associates received a reward due for such a demerite and murther. <HI>Pepin</HI> on the other part hea∣ring that <HI>Norbert</HI> his Lieutenant of Maireship of <HI>France</HI> was deceased, sub∣stituted his second sonne <HI>Grimoald</HI> in the place, and caused him to marry <HI>Theudesinde,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Ratbod,</HI> Duke of <HI>Frizeland.</HI></P>

<P>That which is chiefly observable in

this King, was his dotage on <HI>Alpaide,</HI> a faire &amp; beautifull Gentlewoman, whom he loved beyond all respect of himselfe, letting his Fame bleed to death, woun∣ded with a bad report for his inconti∣nent life.

<PB N="128" REF="70"/>
From thence they came before <HI>Paris</HI> under the conduct of their King <HI>Sige∣sroy,</HI> hoping there also to make a prey as they had done elsewhere; but it was so bravely defended by Count <HI>Eudes</HI> &amp; the Abbot <HI>Goslin,</HI> that they were quite frustrate of their expectation and pre∣tence.

<P>This King was approved in the be∣ginning of his Reigne, and reverenced by his Subjects, but afterwards having

made a dishonourable peace with the <HI>Normans,</HI> yeelding them <HI>Neustria,</HI> now called <HI>Normandy,</HI> hee lost his Subjects affection, and then through griefe and jealousie conceived against his Queene <HI>Richarda,</HI> fell sicke, and through the dis∣temper of his body and minde be∣ing unfit to governe, was deposed, re∣jected both from the Realme and Em∣pire, banished from the Court, and ha∣ving neither house nor meanes, was star∣ved, and dyed for want of reliefe in a poore Village of <HI>Suevia.</HI> Thus one of the great Monarchs of the world dyed without house, without bread, without honour, without mourning, &amp; without memory, but that his end was prodigi∣ously memorable. The reasons were his imperious pride in prosperity, and his despairing dejectednesse in adversity, foolish extreames becomming not a magnanimous mind; therefore his af∣fliction was hated of his subjects, not considering the true cause of his afflicti∣on.

<P>This King being perswaded to take revenge on a Bishop who had under∣hand strooke fire to kindle the tindar of contention betweene him and the Pope, he said: That it was more noble in a Prince to save, than kill; to pardon, than to persecute; and to forgive and remit, rather than to revenge: for saith he, It must be of necessity that all things which angry men doe, must needs be full of blindnesse and necessity, because it is no easie matter for a man troubled with envy, to have the use of Reason; and whatsoever is without Reason, is without Art. It behooveth us therefore to take reason as our guide in all our actions, and to remove these passions of envy and revenge, for they

ought not to rest in a wise mans breast: Yet he was much affronted by Pope <HI>Bo∣niface,</HI> cōmanding him by his <HI>Bull</HI> to suc∣cour the <HI>Tartar,</HI> which the King, enga∣ged in many affaires, refusing to doe, the Bishop sent by the Pope, told him: That if the King would not obey the Pope, he would deprive him of his Realme.

Being told af∣ter a battaile, that his enemy Count <HI>Charolois</HI> did lodge in the field: He re∣plyed, That he having neither Towne nor Castle must needes lodge in a field∣bed. It was his usuall saying: That when pride walketh, or rideth afore, shame and dishonour, like servingmen,
<PB N="273" REF="142"/>
attend behind. Being told that one of the Canons of the Church where hee had heard Masse was dead, he gave the Prebendship to a Priest which lay slee∣ping in an adjoyning Chappell, that hee should say afterward, that his good for∣tune came unto him sleeping. To a Gentleman that was ready to handle a rich Chaine of gold, which a Captaine wore about his neck, and was suspected to be made of the reliques of a Church, he said: Take heede how you touch that Chaine, for it is a holy thing.</P>
<P>He said also, that, in regard of his trou∣bles at the beginning of his reigne, if by the expression of courage and experi∣ence he had not procured feare and re∣verence, he might have beene ranked a∣mongst the unfortunate Princes in the last Chapter of <HI>Boccace.</HI> A rich Noble∣man having builded a faire Hospitall, he said, That having made many poore for the Hospitall, hee might justly make an Hospitall for the poore, and so con∣vert his sinnes into Almes-houses. Hee

would often say to his Noblemen, that his sonne should learne no more Latine, than <HI>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit reg∣nare;</HI> and that the government of the Kingdome and Common-wealth was his best study, for other studies would too much soften his minde, and Histo∣ricall examples, unfortunate in their e∣vent, and successe, would discourage him from attempting brave Actions. He said also that the <HI>Genowayes</HI> should not long remaine under his protection, for he would bequeath them to the Divell. Being advised to send an Embassadour, that had many Dignities and Titles: he said he is like a peece of <HI>Brachigraphy,</HI> that hath many a Title but Learning very little. Being told that the Gout haunted rich men that fared delicious∣ly, and wore fine cloathing; he said, hee would alwaies afterward weare cloath∣cloathes, because the Gout should not take him for a rich man. He could finde all things he said in his Kingdome, and his Court, except truth, which was sicke

The Realme of <HI>France</HI> he said was a meddow which he did cut every yeere, and as often as he listed. He asking a meane fellow, which knew not the King when he saw him, what he gained by following the Court? The fellow answered, I get as much as the King, that is, maintenance while I live, and a sheete when I dye.</P>
<P>He said that a curious ignorant man, having a Library of faire Bookes, was like a crooke-backt man having a Bunch on his backe, whereby the defor∣mity of the one, &amp; the ignorance of the other was more discerned. He made gold the engine of his actions, saying, that an Army of silver Launces doth usually winne the victory. Great services (he said) through the arrogancy of the par∣ties performing them, or the neglect of Princes regarding them, were often re∣compenced with hatred or ingratitude▪ and therefore the bounty of Princes ex∣ceeding
<PB N="276" REF="144"/>
desert was more fortunate and happy than desert exceeding the bounty of Princes, not enduring to be indebted or obliged. Having felt the smart of the English warres, he said the King of <HI>England</HI> was his Brother in his owne Countrey, but hee did not like his company in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Having caused a faire goodly Tombe to bee made for the faire Lady <HI>Agnes,</HI> the love of his late Father, the Cannons of the Church desiring that the Monu∣ment might bee removed out of the heart of the Church into a side Ile, or Chappell, he answered, that their re∣quest was neither just nor reasonable, neither would he suffer her Tombe (whom his father loved) to be vio∣lated.</P>
<P>After <HI>Monsieur Bussi</HI> was beheaded and buryed, he caused the head to be digged up againe, and placed on a wooden pole in the Market place, and so being covered with a scarlet Cappe, furred with <HI>Minivere,</HI> in regard he had

beene a Counsellour of the Parliament. A suiter to the King for an Office, be∣in denyed, humbly thanked his Maje∣stie, who wondring at his moderate, yet man-like spirit, asked if he concei∣ved a right of his answer? yes, said the Suiter, and I thanke your Maje∣sty for giving me a dispatching denyall, rather than feeding delayes: with which Answer the King was so contented, that he had his Office immediatly granted.</P>
<P>A Noble-man seeing this King ride a Hunting on a very little Horse, said he had gotten a goodly stout Horse; for though he seemed but weake and little, yet he must needes be very strong, because he carryed him with all his Counsell: Thereby taxing the King, preferring the wisedome of his owne conceite before all other Counsell.</P>
<P>Hee demanding what present he might bestow on the English Embassa∣dors that might not cost him much, was answered; That he might pre∣sent
<PB N="278" REF="145"/>
them with his Musitians, that so they might not cost him much, as for∣merly they had done.</P>
<P>Before the joyning of a Battaile, this King said hastily unto a Noble-man, that he had no affiance in his service: who for proofe thereof, having desired to exchange Armes and Ensignes with the King, charged bravely on the ene∣my, and being supposed to be the King, was slaine: wherein the King with wee∣ping teares sayd, he had lost his life to expresse his love and loyalty. Being in∣formed that the <HI>Saracens</HI> were misreck∣ned 10000 <HI>Francks,</HI> in the payment of 200000 thousand pounds for a ran∣some, he would not embarke or set saile untill the aforesaid <HI>Francks</HI> were paid: such was his fidelity to those Infidells. This King having appoynted a Bishop to goe take a Muster of the Souldiers in <HI>Paris,</HI> a great Noble-man desired a Commission to reforme the Bishops Church, saying that employment was as fit for him, as the other was for the
<PB N="279" REF="145"/>
Bishop. When this King was <HI>Daul∣phin</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> he taking great pleasure in hunting, often resorted to a poore Forresters Cottage, where he did use to eate Radishes, he comming to be <HI>King,</HI> the Forrester perswaded by his Wife, &amp; in hope of reward, presented to the <HI>King</HI> a faire Radish, which his Majesty accepted, and rewarded the Forrester with a thousand Crownes. After∣ward a Courtier presented the <HI>King</HI> with a faire goodly Horse, expecting a greater reward, because he had beene so bountifull to the Forrester. But the <HI>King</HI> contrary to his expectation, gave the Courtier his Radish, wrapped up in white paper; the Courtier returning to his lodging, opening the packet, found nothing but a Radish, whereup∣on he informed the King of the mis∣take, as he supposed: The King said, I have paide thee well for thy horse: for the present which I gave thee cost mee a thousand Crownes; thus the poore mans good affection was wel rewarded,
<PB N="280" REF="146"/>
and the Courtiers audaciousnesse slight∣ly regarded.</P>
<P>This <HI>Lewis</HI> sends an Embassadour to the Emperour, to excuse him for not sending an army, promised by treaty, en∣treating him not to make a greement with the Duke of <HI>Burgogne;</HI> but that he should confiscate all the Dukes Signo∣nories that held of the Emperour, as hee would doe those that held of the Crowne of <HI>France:</HI> The Emperour an∣swered, that they must not divide the Beares skinne before the Beast be dead. This King commming to an interview of the King of <HI>Castile,</HI> unto whom hee was formerly strickly allyed, conceived a contempt and disdaine each of other: The <HI>French</HI> of the <HI>Castilians</HI> sumptu∣ousnesse and pride, in their words, coun∣tenance and apparrell: The <HI>Castilians</HI> of the plainnesse of the <HI>French</HI> attire: So as from that day these Kings did never love, and the <HI>French</HI> did ever since hate the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>

afterward on colder thoughts growing wiser, this piece of leatherne igno∣rance, contrary to his former agree∣ment, without either fidelity or cour∣tesie, demanded the price of his Goose in the presence of her Husband, and made her, for the former sawce of the Goose, pay him againe. And with this <HI>Italian</HI> Proverb, which had this wanton Originall, the King answered the unfaithfull Embassadours of <HI>Florence.</HI> His Queene <HI>Anne</HI> having received ti∣dings of his Death, said; Gods will be done, I doubt not but I shall be as great as I was before, intimating thereby her hopes to be Queene of <HI>France;</HI> after∣wards verified by her Marriage with King <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth.

After the City of <HI>Dijon</HI> submitted, and in a manner all <HI>Burgun∣dy.</HI> Also the second generall Truce was published, and in the <HI>interim</HI> the re∣conciliation of the Duke of <HI>Mayenne</HI> was wrought, together with those of the Dukes of <HI>Toyeuse</HI> and <HI>Espernon.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of the yeare 1596, the City of <HI>Marsilles</HI> was surrendred to the King, and to the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> Governour of <HI>Provence:</HI> Hee also after eight Moneths siege, tooke the Towne of <HI>La Fere</HI> in <HI>Picardy</HI> about mid <HI>May,</HI> notwithstanding the resistance of the <HI>Spanish</HI> forces then under the Conduct of the Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> who came purposely out of <HI>Flanders</HI> to raise that siege.</P>
<P>At <HI>Rouen</HI> in a generall assembly of the
<PB N="324" REF="168"/>
Peeres of <HI>France,</HI> the Alliance between him and Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>England</HI> was renewed by Embassages extraordi∣nary in <HI>October,</HI> when the King recei∣ved from her the Order of <HI>St. George, (aliàs)</HI> the <HI>Garter,</HI> as, not long before, the Order of the <HI>Chevalry</HI> or <HI>Knight∣hood</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was sent unto the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> by <HI>Monsieur</HI> the Marshall of <HI>Bouillon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1599. the King made ordinary Knights of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> at <HI>Rouen,</HI> which was never there done be∣fore, at any other place than at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after, the Towne of <HI>Ami∣ens</HI> was taken by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and cruelly pillaged for the space of 5. daies, and the <HI>French</HI> beaten out. The King resolved upon a revenging siege, and to that end caused it to be encompassed by <HI>Monsieur</HI> the Marshall of <HI>Biron</HI> and his Troops for the impeachments of all manner of supplies: and the King in person the 21. of <HI>May</HI> marched towards
<PB N="325" REF="168"/>
the said siege of <HI>Amiens,</HI> which after many furious assaults, Sallies, and Skir∣mishes, was surrendred upon composi∣tion upon Thursday the 25. of <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI> notwithanding that the Cardinall of <HI>Austria</HI> came even to the Trenches with an Army of 18000. foot, and 2000 Horse, with 18. Cannons for Battery, but was valiantly beaten backe, and in∣tercepted of his designe of relieving the City, and enforced to a shamefull re∣treate, with the losse of a great part of his men.</P>
<P>The same yeare the Marriage of the King with <HI>Madam Margaret</HI> of <HI>France</HI> for many strong and lawfull causes was annulled and made void, and by the Authority of Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the eight, was so published.</P>
<P>The yeare 1600. the Marriage of the King was treated, and concluded with the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medicis,</HI> Princesse of <HI>Florence,</HI> Daughter of the late Great Duke of <HI>Tuscany, Francis</HI> of <HI>Medicis,</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="169" MS="y"/>
and of <HI>Joane</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> Daughter of the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and in <HI>May</HI> shee in her owne Countrey was proclai∣med Queene of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The 13. of <HI>June</HI> 1602. <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Biron,</HI> and Lord High Marshall of <HI>France,</HI> being come to <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> was arrested upon high Treason by the Kings command, and from thence conveyed to the <HI>Bastile</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> Hee was convicted by his Peeres for at∣tempts against the Kings Person and State, and upon the Munday before, being the 29. of <HI>July,</HI> hee was adjudged to lose his head, with the confiscation of his goods, and the land of <HI>Biron</HI> de∣prived for ever of being a Dutchy and Pairy of <HI>France,</HI> and was reunited to the Crowne.</P>
<P>It was pleaded against him, <HI>Qui nec virtute nec fide prodest, prosit exemplo: He that can never profit by his vertue, nor his loyalty, must profit by his example;</HI> and thereupon he was condemned, and
<PB N="327" REF="169" MS="y"/>
put into the said Bastile, whither the Chancellour comming to pronounce the sentence of death against him, hee shaked the Chancellour by the Arme, saying, You have judged me, and God will absolve me; hee will lay open their iniquities, which have shut their eyes, because they would not see my innocen∣cy: You my Lord shall answer for this injustice before him, whither I doe summon you within a yeare and a day. I goe before by the judgment of men, but those that are the cause of my death, shall come after by the judgment of God. Afterward he said, I see well that I am not the most wicked, but I am the most unfortunate. Those that have done worse than I would have done, are favoured, the Kings Clemency is dead for me. He doth not imitate <HI>Caesar</HI> nor <HI>Augustu,</HI> or those great Princes, who not onely pardoned the intention of doing ill, but the Act; and wherein can the King shew himselfe greater than in
<PB N="328" REF="170"/>
pardoning? Clemency is a Kingly ver∣tue; every one may give Death, but it belongs onely to Soveraignty to give life: But the Chancellour told him, that a condemned man must not dispute a∣gainst his Judgment, whereupon the Duke of <HI>Biron</HI> delivered up the Kings order. Afterward the Chancellour said that hee had brought two Divines to comfort him, and prepare him for death, but the Duke said, That he was already prepared, and that his soule was in such tranquillity, as the night before hee had spoken with God. Within few daies after he was beheaded, and his body in∣terred by night in the Church of <HI>S. Paul.</HI></P>
<P>The yeare 1604. the King was adver∣tised that one <HI>Nicholas l'Hoste,</HI> Secreta∣ry of State, discovered to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> (from whom he received an an∣nuall Pension to that end) the secrets and affaires of the State: upon the no∣tice taken <HI>L'Hoste</HI> put himselfe in flight for his owne safety, but he was so closely
<PB N="329" REF="170"/>
followed and pursued, that he was en∣forced to hide himselfe in the River of <HI>Marne,</HI> where he dyed through cold and feare. His body being found, was con∣demned to bee drawne in peeces with wilde horses, and the foure quarters to be set upon foure wheeles at foure gates of <HI>Paris.</HI> The yeare 1610. there were taken out of the <HI>Arsenal</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> Fifty great Gunnes, with store of Munition of powder and shot, and great numbers of Souldiers were leavied.</P>
<P>The King intended shortly after to enter into his Army, but he would first see his Queene should bee crowned at <HI>St. Denis,</HI> which was performed with great solemnity. But the next day af∣ter this Magnificence and pompe of the Queenes Coronation, this great King was on Friday the 14. of <HI>May,</HI> 1610. a∣bout foure in the afternoone most tray∣terously murthered in his Caroch with two stabbs with a knife neare the region of his heart, passing in the Streete of the

<HI>Ferronery,</HI> neare the Charnells of the <HI>Innocents</HI> Church-yard, by <HI>Francis Ra∣vaillac,</HI> borne in <HI>Angolesme.</HI> His Obse∣quies were performed the three dayes following, the 21, 22, 23. of <HI>June,</HI> with infinite teares and lamentations: and af∣ter many funebriall solemnities, his Corps was conducted to <HI>St. Denis,</HI> where it remaineth interred.</P>
<P>He lived fifty sixe yeares, and thirty one daies. Hee reigned in <HI>Navarre</HI> Thirty seven yeares, eleaven moneths, or thereabout; and in <HI>France</HI> Twenty yeares, nine moneths, and thirteene dayes.</P>

<P>This yeare were solemnized the mar∣riages of the <HI>King</HI> with the Lady <HI>Anne Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and of the Kings Sister, with the Prince of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>

<P>The Prince distasted with the Kings espousalls with the Queene at <HI>Burgos,</HI> made a hurly burly in the Countrey,

but the Espousalls being ended, the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> with a strong Army con∣ducted her to <HI>Fontarable,</HI> where shee was received by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and an exchange being made, the Queene was by the said Duke conveyed to <HI>Bourde∣aux,</HI> where shee was most magnificently entertained by the King, where hee ex∣pected her, and the Nuptials were cele∣brated on St. <HI>Katharines</HI> day.</P>
<P>The yeare 1616. such was the rigour of cold weather in <HI>January,</HI> that the Ri∣vers were frozen, and the yce was the cause of the fall of St. <HI>Michaels</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The 16. of <HI>August,</HI> the taking of <HI>Pe∣ronne</HI> was a cause of new commotions, and the first of <HI>September</HI> was apprehen∣ded at the <HI>Louure,</HI> and after kept under a strong guard in the <HI>Bastile.</HI></P>
<P>Many of the Lords retired from the Court, as the Duke of <HI>Vendosme,</HI> of <HI>Ne∣vers,</HI> of <HI>Guise,</HI> of <HI>Mayenne,</HI> and <HI>Bovillon,</HI> with other Lords, whereof some retur∣ned againe, the others not: which was
<PB N="340" REF="176"/>
a cause that the King in Parliament de∣clared the causes wherefore he kept the Prince his brother in hold.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the yeare 1617. he made a Declaration against the Duke of <HI>Nevers</HI> in Parliament, the 17. of <HI>Ja∣nuary,</HI> also in <HI>February</HI> against the Dukes of <HI>Vendosme, Mayenne, Bouillon,</HI> the Marquesse of <HI>Caevure,</HI> and the President <HI>le Jay.</HI> Also another Declaration was made in <HI>March</HI> for the re-union to his <HI>Domaines,</HI> and a Confiscation of the goods of the said Nobility upon the 16. of the said Moneth.</P>
<P>This King succeeded after the Tragi∣call death of his Father, when great troubles were like to follow; but all those clouds were blowne away, and this young Prince shined forth like the Sun in a cleare skie. First of all hee went to the Parliament, and made a Declara∣tion that his Mother should be Queene Regent during his minority. After∣ward the Jesuites received his Fathers

heart, with great Ceremony, being re∣ceived into <HI>La Flech.</HI> Here the Arraign∣ment and cruell Execution of the Mur∣therer <HI>Ravilliac</HI> deserves to be drawne forth in blacke colours. Imagine that <HI>Ravilliac</HI> was first arraign'd after he had beene put to the Rack, then condem∣ned, afterward hee was brought out of the prison in his shirt, with a Torch of two pound weight lighted in one hand, and the knife wherewith he had murde∣red the King, chained to the other: then he was set upright in a Dung-cart, now hee is doing pennance at our <HI>Ladies Church;</HI> now imagine the raging people are ready to teare him in peeces, but the Officers restraine them; the Murderer came to the Scaffold, he crosses himselfe in signe that he dyed a Papist; hee was bound to a St. <HI>Andrews Crosse,</HI> then his fatall hand with the knife chained to it, smoaks in a Furnace of fire and brim∣stone; it is consum'd, yet hee will not confesse any thing, but roare and cry like
<PB N="342" REF="177"/>
to a Soule in hell, but yet unpitied: and then his flesh was pulld off with hot Pin∣cers, and burnt, then scalding Oyle, Ro∣zen, pitch, and brimstone, melted toge∣ther, were powr'd into his wounds, and on his navell a roundell of Clay was set, into the which they powred molten Lead, and then he roared, but confessed nothing. At last, to conclude this Tra∣gedy, his body was torne in pieces with foure strong Horses, which could not plucke them asunder, being so firmely knit together, untill the flesh under his armes and thighes was cut. In this man∣ner was this Paricide tormented and ex∣ecuted, being the horrid picture of a Traytor, suffering extreame tortures, yet misery nor death could not enforce from him any confession. And surely if Hells tortures might be felt on earth, it was approved in this mans punishment, yet he would reveale nothing, but that he did it by the instigation of the Devil, and his maine reason was, because the
<PB N="343" REF="177" MS="y"/>
King tollerated two Religions in his Kingdome. Oh small occasion, that for this cause one servile slave should thu quench the great light of <HI>France,</HI> whose brightnesse glistred thorow <HI>Europe:</HI> One thing this Villaine confessed, that of all the severall torments that were inven∣ted and laid upon him, none was more terrible to him, than his losse of sleepe for sixe dayes and nights together, for there were appointed severall offi∣cers by turnes to keepe him waking, by thrusting red-hot bodkins into his breasts and sides; so that if he did but of∣fer to winke or give a nod, then present∣ly they awaked him with those Irons. He was torne in peeces as I said before, and his bones burnt, the ashes whereof were scattered in the winde, as being thought unworthy of the earths buriall. This <HI>Ravaillac</HI> was borne at <HI>Angolesme,</HI> and by profession a Lawyer, and was perswaded as it is thought, by the Jesu∣ites to perpetrate this bloody act, by
<PB N="344" REF="178"/>
murdering this Kings Father, <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the hope of Learning, and the glory of Armes. Afterward the Duke of <HI>Fener,</HI> Embassadour from <HI>Spaine,</HI> came to <HI>Paris,</HI> and being brought into the Kings presence, he said that he came from the King his Master to visite his Majesty. This young <HI>Prince</HI> answered, I thanke the King my brother for his good will, I will remember him and you also: Seeing he desires it, he may ex∣pect from me all friendship and good in∣telligence, such as hee had with the de∣ceased King my Father. Afterward the Lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> Embassadour from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> came to <HI>Paris,</HI> and then Embassa∣dours for confirmation of mutuall league being sent into <HI>Spaine, England,</HI> and to <HI>Rome,</HI> the King was at <HI>Rheims</HI> with solemne pompe and great state crowned.</P>
