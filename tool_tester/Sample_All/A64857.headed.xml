<HEAD>To the Worthy and my ever Honored Friends,
HENRY HEYLYN
of Minster-Lovel, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Nephew;
AND
HENRY HEYLYN Gentleman, Son, to Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Know no persons in the Nation,
that have a more unquestionable
right unto these Papers, than you;
who have not only running in
your Veins the Blood, but, which is
more material, abiding in your minds
the Endowments of the Great Man,
whose <HI>Life</HI> is now perfected and expo∣sed
to publick view. In which it must be
acknowledged there is sufficient matter
for an useful History: And either of
you might have named the man, who
had been more able to have underta∣ken
<PB REF="3"/>
the Writing of it than my self; it
being a very bold attempt for any one
to give an account of the Actions and
Sufferings of Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> beside Dr.
<HI>Heylyn;</HI> or at least such an one, who
inherits his <HI>Natural,</HI> if not his <HI>Acqui∣red</HI>
Accomplishments, and to whom
an <HI>equal,</HI> if not a <HI>double</HI> portion of his
Spirit is imparted.</P>
<P>However, 'tis no small satisfaction
to me, that I have in this Composure
obey'd your Commands, and in some
measure answered your expectations
in doing right to the memory of your
very learned Ancestor, if your Friend∣ship
and Affection did not put a veil
upon your Judgments, when you first
read what I now again offer to your
perusal.</P>
<P>There is little doubt, but in the
publication of these Papers, the very
name of Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> will raise the
Blood, and exasperate the Passions of
some quarrelsom and unquiet spirits,
who like Ghosts and Goblins fight
with those that are <HI>dead,</HI> as well as
<PB REF="3"/>
affright others that are <HI>living.</HI> But
whatever hard censures or harder
names the Writer of these Papers meets
with, 'tis no more than he expects from
those who are such enemies unto
peace, that notwithstanding all their
pleadings for it, yet their souls are so
connaturaliz'd to turbulency and con∣tention,
that rather than have no ene∣my,
they will fall out and fight with
their own shadows. And who can ex∣pect
but that the peace and quiet of
private men should be ruffled and dis∣composed
by those, whose business it is
to embroil a whole Nation? And yet
these persons must by all means be ac∣counted
the <HI>only True Protestants.</HI> A
name, tho it imports little in it of the
positive part of Christianity (it being
only a rejecting or <HI>protesting</HI> against
the abominable Errors and Superstiti∣ons
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church) yet 'tis too
honorable a Title to be bestowed upon
many that boast of it.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
It was in <HI>April,</HI> 1529. when Refor∣med
Christianity obtain∣ed
the glorious name of
<HI>Protestantism;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleid. Com. l. 6.</NOTE> which in
a short time spread it self not only over
the <HI>German</HI> Empire, but most of the
<HI>European</HI> Nations. And here in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
(especially) it prevailed over Po∣pish
Darkness and Superstitions by
Peaceableness, Meekness, Modesty,
Humility, Mercifulness; and by teach∣ing
men to be studious of doing good,
and averse to vice and doing evil.
What right then have those to it, who
are Turbulent, Contentious, Malicious,
Proud, Merciless, Wrathful, <HI>&amp;c▪</HI> Why
should those be celebrated for zealous
<HI>Protestants,</HI> who question the Being,
and blaspheme the name of God▪ Who
deny the only Lord that bought them?
Who renounce all the Offices and Insti∣tutions
of Christianity, and whose
lives are a direct contradiction to all
Moral as well as Evangelical Virtues.
In a word, why should the <HI>Indepen∣dents</HI>
with some other Sects now re∣assume
<PB REF="4"/>
this Renowned Title, when in
the days of ihe late <HI>Vsurper</HI> they abso∣lutely
renounced it, calling those,
who would not list themselves as mem∣bers
in their Schismatical Assemblies,
<HI>Queen Besses Protestants?</HI></P>
<P>The words of the devout <HI>Salvian</HI>
are with a little variation applicable
unto these Professors, <HI>In vobis patitur
Christus opprobrium, in vobis patitur
lex Protestantium maledictum.</HI> The
name of <HI>Protestancy</HI> which heretofore
commanded veneration from ingenu∣ous
(tho professed) enemies, is now
prophaned and blasphemed through
these persons and stinks amongst <HI>Pa∣pists</HI>
and <HI>Infidels:</HI> either of which Sects
do as much deserve the name of <HI>Catho∣licks,</HI>
as some do that of <HI>Protestants.</HI>
When 'tis bestowed on them, 'tis only
<HI>Titular,</HI> and a meer <HI>nick-name.</HI> They
are <HI>Pseudo-Protestants,</HI> as <HI>Papists</HI> are
<HI>Pseudo-Catholicks.</HI> Neither is it mate∣rial
what way of Religion is embraced
by them; whether <HI>True</HI> or <HI>False, Chri∣stian</HI>
or <HI>Pagan, Protestant</HI> or <HI>Popish, any</HI>
or <HI>none,</HI> or <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
God be praised, notwithstanding the
great declensions of true Goodness
amongst us, we have many persons of
Eminency and Honor in the Nation,
who are not carried away from their
Loyalty to their Prince, and Love to
the Church by any popular Artifices
of those Zealots who lie in wait to de∣ceive
unstable and less discerning
minds. Amongst whom I heartily re∣joyce
that both you are in the num∣ber;
and I shall pray to God ever to
<HI>continue you in that holy Fellowship,</HI>
and to preserve you from the evil of
this world, whilst you remain in it;
as also to reward you for the many
charitable and friendly Offices, which
you have expressed and conferr'd up∣on</P>

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAD it not been for the indi∣scretion
of some persons, and
the forwardness and ostenta∣tion
of others, no one had been
put to the trouble of reading, or expence
of buying a second Impression of Dr. <HI>Hey∣lyn</HI>'s
Life; this very Account of it ha∣ving
been writ on purpose to be printed
with that learned Volume of his works
that has been lately collected and exposed
to publick Light: wherein the Reader
may reap the benefit of being satisfied in
various Points, both <HI>Theological</HI> and
<HI>Political.</HI> As, 1. In the <HI>way</HI> and
<HI>manner</HI> of the <HI>Reformation</HI> of the
Church of <HI>England;</HI> and that both a∣gainst
the <HI>Papists</HI> who tell us we had too
little of the <HI>Pope,</HI> and too much of the
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>Parliament;</HI> and against the <HI>Genevi∣zers,</HI>
who affirm, that we had too little
of the People, and too much of the Prince
therein. 2. In the sacred Offices of the
publick <HI>Liturgy;</HI> wherein is presented
to the Reader a <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Liturgies</HI>
from the <HI>Patriarchs, Jews, Gentiles</HI>
and <HI>Christians;</HI> as also an Account of
the <HI>Dedication</HI> of Churches, and the
<HI>Anniversary Feasts</HI> occasioned thereby.
3. In the Churches <HI>Patrimony,</HI> and the
Right of the <HI>Clergy</HI> to receive <HI>Tithes</HI>
from the People. 4. In her <HI>Govern∣ment;</HI>
wherein both from the sacred
Scriptures and Ancient Fathers is evin∣ced
by way of <HI>Historical</HI> Narration,
(and matter of Fact cannot be so easily
evaded as bare Logical Argumentation)
the Imparity of Ministers in the Christi∣an
Church; the Foundation of which was
laid in Episcopacy. 5. In the <HI>Time</HI> set
apart for Divine Worship; wherein the
constant Practice of the Church of God
from the Creation to the Year 1635. is
Learnedly and Laboriously represented
in that matter. 6. In the <HI>Doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine</HI> of
<PB REF="6"/>
the <HI>Western</HI> Churches, concerning the
five Controverted points; an <HI>Historical</HI>
Account of which is given out of the Pub∣lick
Acts and Monuments, aswell as the
most approved Authors in those several
Churches. 7. In the Kings <HI>Supreme
Dignity</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> against that
<HI>Stumbling-block</HI> of Disobedience and
Rebellion, laid by Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> about the
<HI>Ephori</HI> of <HI>Sparta,</HI> the <HI>Tribunes</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and the <HI>Demarchi</HI> of <HI>Athens;</HI> than
which Treatise few more Rational or
Learned have seen the light upon that
subject. And lastly, in the Bishops <HI>Right</HI>
of <HI>Peerage;</HI> a Treatise written in the
Year 1640. when it was Voted in the
House of Lords, <HI>That no Bishop should
be of the Committee for the preparato∣ry
Examination of the Earl of</HI> Strafford:
this Tract was never before Printed; and
as for the rest that were, they could rarely
be met with to be sold; and those that
could, were not to be purchased at any
ordinary or easie rates. And there is no
Reason, but that the old Books (Lear∣ned
and useful as they are) reprinted,
<PB REF="7"/>
should meet with as kind reception from
the World, as new Books composed with
less judgment out of old ones; unless it
be that some finical Readers will have
their fancies gratified by the novelty of
a Title Page, even like some Ladies that
are always affecting new Modes and Fa∣shions
in their Garbs and Garments:
And there are Botchers in Books as well
as Cloaths, that have the knack to make
new ones out of old ones.</P>
<P>I shall not attempt to particularize or
rectifie either the mistakes or omissions,
that are in the <HI>Life,</HI> as it stands before
the collected Treatises now specified. The
Reader may easily discern both, by com∣paring
what is there writ, with the Me∣morials
now published. In which, I have
made use of no materials out of the Prin∣ted
<HI>Folio,</HI> except these two, <HI>viz.</HI> The
charitable zeal which the <HI>Doctor</HI> exer∣ted
in saving the Parish-Church of St.
<HI>Nicholas</HI> in <HI>Abingdon</HI> from being laid
even with the ground, and the Dream
that he had immediately before his fatal
Sickness: neither of which came unto my
<PB REF="7"/>
knowledg before I met with them before
the <HI>Collection,</HI> And I hope he that fa∣voured
the World with the publication
of them will pardon my presumption;
since what I have made use of, tends to
the adorning of the memory of so near a
Relation; and since also many more par∣ticular
passages were excerpted out of my
Papers (the very words as well as matter)
when he had them in his Custody; as any
Reader may easily discern, who will be at
the pains of comparing the Life now Pub∣lished,
with what is extant before the
<HI>Keimelia Ecclesiastica.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, though I did with some
unwillingness and regret undertake the
writing of what is here offered to the
World, yet I was the more easily induced
to it, not only out of Reverence to the
memory of a right Learned man, and the
honour that I owe to some of his nearest
Relatives; but also from those black
Clouds of darkness, which have of late
threatned our publick Peace and Com∣mon
Interests; deeming that it would be
beneficial unto my self, and not unaccep∣table
<PB REF="8"/>
unto Loyal <HI>English-men</HI> (especially
those of the Clergy) if their minds were
fortified with Courage and Resolution to
suffer and submit unto the Will of God
in the times that might happen, by cal∣ling
to remembrance what others have
done in the days that are past. For God
does not only <HI>know the Frame</HI> of our Bo∣dies,
that they are <HI>dust,</HI> but the temper
of our minds, <HI>viz.</HI> how averse they are
to exercise patience under heavy Perse∣cutions,
and how unable to contend with
the infelicity of an unrighteous World,
unless he did now and then represent unto
our view some fresh example of his righ∣teous
servants, who by their faith and
patience, have beat out a path and made
the way plain before us. And whoever
reads over the following Account given
of Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> will find few of his Qua∣lity
and Profession, who survived the fu∣ry
of that storm that was raised in the
Vnnatural War, and who brought their
Vessel to safe shore and landing at the
last, that endured more numerous and vi∣olent
<HI>Hurricanes,</HI> than he did. And
<PB REF="8"/>
what can be more seasonable or advanta∣geous
against that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that lan∣guishing
and faintness of spirit which
may possibly seize on us under the Cross,
than that being in a tendency to endure
and encounter with the like hardships, we
should arm our selves with the same Re∣solution
of mind, as the person did, trea∣ted
of in these papers? Perhaps the per∣secutions
that are here mentioned are not
of so wide an extent, as to furnish any
one with a <HI>Panoplie</HI> against all the Evils,
that this inconstant World may bring up∣on
us, But although they may not in all
respects parallel those sufferings which
may be our Portion and Lot, yet they may
be of that efficacy to mind us of our duty;
and to prepare us for the vicissitudes of
Providence, that whenever our <HI>Fiery
Tryal</HI> comes, we may not think it <HI>strange</HI>
or unusual; but by some preparatory ex∣ercises
of Piety and self-denial we may
be mortifying in our selves all that
softness, tenderness and effeminacy of
temper, which will render Affliction
grievous and intollearable to us. The
<PB REF="9"/>
blessed Apostle acquaints us what good
effect his passive fortitude produced
in some new Converts to Christianity,
when they became possessed of the very
same zeal and constancy as he had; for
<HI>waxing confident by his bonds, they
were much more bold to speak the
word without fear,</HI> Phil. 1. 14. God be
praised, as yet we have no sharper perse∣cutions
to exercise our Christian Vertues,
than what have befallen the holiest Chri∣stians
in the most flourishing Condition of
the Church. The Sun shines upon our
Tabernacles, and notwithstanding all the
outcries about <HI>Property</HI> and <HI>Liberty,</HI>
yet there is no such irruption into either,
as to occasion <HI>complaining in our streets.</HI>
But we know not how soon our Fate may
be the same with Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s; to be
brought before the <HI>Rulers of the dark∣ness
of this World</HI> for the sake of the
Christian Righteousness. And whenever
'tis our lot, it concerns us to behave our
selves with that Faith and Courage, that
we neither violate the Oaths we have ta∣ken,
nor disgrace the Religion we profess,
<PB REF="9"/>
nor forfeit the happiness we hope for and
expect. We see with our eyes, or hear
with our ears, with what resolution men
suffer for evil doing. And if a natural
Sturdiness or Fool-hardiness does sustain
the spirits of men against the Terrors of
a violent Death, notwithstanding those
black guilts of Schism, Faction, Sedition,
Treason, Murther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which lye upon
their consciences; What a disgrace will
it be unto our profession, for us to be <HI>wea∣ry
and faint in our minds,</HI> when any ex∣ternal
evils or dangers make disquieting
impressions on them? And there is no bet∣ter
way for us to prevent that dishonour,
than by <HI>looking unto Jesus the Author
and Finisher of our Faith, and by ta∣king
those who have spoken in his
Name for an example of suffering Affli∣ction
and of Patience,</HI> Iam. 5. 10.</P>
<P>But although Dr. <HI>Heylyn spoke in
Name of the Lord,</HI> yet few will be pre∣vailed
with to take him for a pattern in
suffering persecution, who believe those
black Characters, that have been of late
given him by some of the Writers of this
<PB REF="10"/>
pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent Age. And amongst the rest, 'tis
matter of just wonder that Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI>
who writes so frequently of Death and
Iudgment, and the account that must be
given of all the <HI>hard speeches</HI> that are
either spoke or writ against his Fellow-Christians,
should not be desirous to leave
the troublesome stage of this world in a
peaceable and calm temper, and let those
sleep quietly in their
Graves, whom he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">So he did in a Letter to Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></NOTE> <HI>wish'd
he had let alone,</HI> when
alive; and unto whose
learned labors he has not vouchsafed to
return one word of Answer for above
these two and twenty years. And yet so
it is, that in his <HI>Preface</HI> to the <HI>Abridg∣ment</HI>
of Church-History he represents
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> to be a man of <HI>a malicious
and bloody strain,</HI> and one who <HI>spake
of blood with pleasure, thirsting after
more,</HI> &amp;c. I shall say little of that Book
of Mr. <HI>Baxters,</HI> understanding that it is
taken into consideration by another hand.
But this I will not be afraid to affirm,
that if an impartial Pagan were to pass
<PB REF="10"/>
his judgment upon Christianity from those
matters of Fact, that are recorded in the
<HI>Abridgment,</HI> he would look upon it with
a more uncharitable eye than Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>
does upon Dr. <HI>Heylyn;</HI> and conclude it
the most horrid Imposture in the world.
For what kind of Religion and Church
was that, which had little or nothing but
Covetousness, Ambition, Oppression, Si∣mony,
Anarchy, Tyranny, Cruelty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
prevailing in it for so many centuries of
years, and no persons or conventions of
men that had Wisdom and Power all that
while to manage its affairs and concerns,
and to put it into any Apostolical or toler∣able
Order, till an <HI>Army-Black-Coat,</HI>
who first almost dreined his Veins of their
Blood against his Prince, and then cour∣ted
and caress'd a Tyrant and Vsurper;
and since that time has been employing
his Spleen against the Church; I say, till
such an one arose in the world, and in af∣front
to all the laws of Modesty and good
Manners, first prescribed a Platform of
Civil Polity or <HI>Holy-Commonwealth</HI> to
the State, and then Rules of Government
<PB REF="11"/>
or Polity to the Church, which should bind
all Christians, and be a Standard to all
Superiors? Let but any one seriously pe∣ruse
the <HI>Abridgment,</HI> and then judg,
whether <HI>Herod</HI> endeavoured with more
malice to suppress the Genealogies of the
<HI>Jewish</HI> Nation (and especially those of
the Royal Family) that he himself might
reign with more security, than Mr. <HI>Bax∣ter</HI>
has done, in throwing dirt upon Anti∣quity:
whereas a Divine, of all men in
the World ought to be very tender, how
he exposed the Nakedness of the Ancient
Fathers, lest he thereby exposed Christi∣anity
it self to scorn and contempt. And
we do not live in such an Age of piety
and modesty, but that some men would be
very glad from the <HI>Abridgment</HI> (if they
had patience to read it) to fix the like
Infamy upon the Christian Faith, as <HI>Cham</HI>
did when he proclaimed the Nakedness
of his Aged Father.</P>
<P>For my own part I never had the Ho∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur
either to know Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> or to be
known by him. But those who were his
Familiars represent him to be one of a
<PB REF="11"/>
tender compassionate Spirit, and that few
men put a more candid construction upon
Persons and Actions, than he did. 'Tis
true, he writ of a bloody Sect; but with
a purpose to prevent the shedding of
more Blood. He vindicated the <HI>Mo∣narchy</HI>
and <HI>Hierarchy</HI> from the Calum∣nies
of that Faction, that was and is the
implacable and sworn enemy of both. And
for this the Ashes of his Grave must be di∣sturbed
by one, who (as <HI>Tullie</HI> speaks)
<HI>does not consider but cast Lots in wri∣ting
Books,</HI> and whose voluminous Trea∣tises
are no more to be compared with the
Learned Writers of this Church, than
the stuff of <HI>Kiderminster</HI> is to be valued
at the same rate with the best <HI>Arras.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> was no more a Man of
Blood, than St. <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Mover of Se∣dition.</HI>
And if he had, 'tis to be hoped,
he might have been as well Canonized for
fighting for his Prince, as some others are
celebrated for <HI>Saints</HI> in the <HI>Everlasting
Rest,</HI> who died in the very Act of Rebel∣lion
against him. But 'tis no new thing for
those who cut a purse, to cry stop the Thief.</P>
<P><PB REF="12"/>
Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> may be pleased to call to
mind, what was done to one Major <HI>Jenning</HI>
the last War, in that Fight that was
between <HI>Lynsel</HI> and <HI>Longford</HI> in the
County of <HI>Salop;</HI> where the Kings Party
having unfortunately the worst of the day,
the poor Major was stript almost naked
and left for dead in the Field. But
Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> and one Lieutenant <HI>Hurd∣man</HI>
taking their walk among the woun∣ded
and dead Bodies, perceived some
Life left in the Major, and <HI>Hurdman</HI>
run him through the Body in cold blood;
Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> all the while looking on, and

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
Dr. Peter Heylyn.</HEAD>
<P>IF any Augury or Conjecture could
be made of the Course and For∣tune
of Mens Lives by the Cal∣culation
of their Nativity, the
Birth of Dr. <HI>Peter Heylyn,</HI> according
to the Rules of our Astrologers, presa∣ged
firm Constitution of Body, and
prosperous Success in the Civil Affairs
of Humane Life. For it was <HI>Novemb.</HI>
29. 1599. at <HI>Burford,</HI> in the County
of <HI>Oxon,</HI> between Eight and Nine in
the Morning. At which time the Sun
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
was in the <HI>Horoscope</HI> of his Nativity,
and the <HI>Houses</HI> very well disposed.
But our <HI>Almanack</HI> Prognostications a∣bout
Weather, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shew what incon∣siderable
Influence the Stars have up∣on
the inanimate-part of the Creation,
much less upon free and discerning A∣gents;
especially upon men Wise and
Learned: For Wisdom has an Empire
over Stars and Constellations, accord∣ing
to that Adagy,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>
And this Reverend Man was in this
particular fortunate, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad the
honor to carry the mark of the Cross,
which was imprinted on him at the
Font, through the most considerable
part of his Pilgrimage; having frequent
opportunities in Suffering for a Righte∣ous
Cause, to manifest his Passive, as
well as his Active Courage; as will
sufficiently appear in the subsequent
Circumstances and Account of his
Life.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="15"/>
He was the second Son of <HI>Henry
Heylyn,</HI> Gentleman, descended from
the Antient Family of the <HI>Heylyns</HI> of
<HI>Pentre-Heylyn</HI> in <HI>Montgomery-shire,</HI>
then part of <HI>Powes-land;</HI> from the
Princes whereof they were derived,
and unto whom they were Hereditary
<HI>Cup-Bearers:</HI> For so the word <HI>Heylyn</HI>
doth signifie in the <HI>Welsh</HI> or <HI>British</HI>
Language. After which Office, they
were in great Authority with the Prin∣ces
of <HI>North-Wales;</HI> as plainly appears
from <HI>Llewellyn,</HI> the last Prince of that
Country, who made choice of <HI>Grono-Ap-Heylyn</HI>
to Treat with the Commis∣sioners
of <HI>Edward</HI> the First, King of
<HI>England,</HI> for the Concluding of a full
and final Peace between them. And
<HI>Pentre-Heylyn</HI> continued the Seat of
this Antient Family till about the
Year 1637. at which time <HI>Rowland
Heylyn,</HI> Alderman and Sheriff of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and Cousin-German to our Do∣ctors
Father, dying without Issue-Male,
the Seat was transferred to another
Family, into which some of the Heires∣ses
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
were Married: But the Doctor de∣sign'd
to repurchase it, and had infal∣libly
effected it, had not Death preven∣ted
the Execution of his Purpose.</P>
<P>His Mother was <HI>Elizabeth Clampard,</HI>
Daughter of <HI>Francis Clampard</HI> of <HI>Wro∣tham</HI>
in <HI>Kent,</HI> Gentleman, and of <HI>Ma∣ry
Dodge</HI> his Wife; Descended in a di∣rect
Line from that <HI>Peter Dodge</HI> of <HI>Stop∣worth</HI>
in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> unto whom King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the First gave the <HI>Seigneury</HI> or
Lordship of <HI>Padenhugh</HI> in the Barony
of <HI>Coldingham</HI> in the Realm of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
as well for the especial Services
done by him in the Sieges of <HI>Barwick</HI>
and <HI>Dunbar,</HI> as his Valour shew'd in
divers Battels; <HI>Encontre son grand
Enemy &amp; Rebelle le Baillol Roy d' Escoce
&amp; Vassal d'Angleterre,</HI> as the words
are in the Original Charter of Arms,
given to the said <HI>Peter Dodge</HI> by <HI>Guyen</HI>
King of <HI>Arms</HI> at the said Kings Com∣mand,
dated <HI>April</HI> 8. in the 34th. year
of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First. Neither is
this unworthy of observation, that one
of the Descendents from the said <HI>Peter
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
Dodge</HI> was Uncle to Doctor <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s
Mother, and gave the <HI>Mannor</HI> of <HI>Lech∣lade</HI>
in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> worth 1400 <HI>l.
per ann.</HI> to <HI>Robert Bathurst</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Uncle
to our Reverend Doctor, and Grand-Father
to that honest and modest Gen∣tleman
Sir <HI>Edward Bathurst</HI> Baronet,
now living.</P>
<P>In the sixth year of his Age, he was
committed to the Tuition of Master
<HI>North,</HI> School-Master of <HI>Burford;</HI> un∣der
whose Instructions he so well pro∣fited,
that in a short time he was able
to make true <HI>Latine:</HI> and his Improve∣ments
were so very considerable, that
in a little space after he was advanc'd
a Form higher than his Fellows; with
which he kept pace and arrived to the
ability of making Verses: to which ex∣cellency,
together with History, his
<HI>Genius</HI> did so naturally incline him, that
at the Age of ten years he framed a
Story in Verse and Prose upon a ludi∣crous
Subject, of which he himself was
Spectator. And he Composed it in imi∣tation
of the <HI>History of the Destructi∣on
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
of</HI> Troy, and some other Books of
Chivalry, upon which he was then ve∣ry
studious and intent. The Story was
exceedingly prized by his School-Fel∣lows,
and afterward by one Master
<HI>Hinton,</HI> Fellow of <HI>Merton-College,</HI> un∣to
whom it was communicated by his
Father. And I presume to specifie it as
an Argument of the prodigious preg∣nancy
of those Endowments which
God had bestowed upon him. For he
may truly be accounted one of the
<HI>Praecoces Fructus,</HI> the forward Fruits
of his time, that was soon ripe, and
contrary to the Proverb, of a lasting
duration. It may be truly affirmed of
him, as once of <HI>Lipsius, Ingenium ba∣buit
docile, &amp; omnium capax: Memo∣ria
non sine praeceptorum miraculo (eti∣am
in puero) quae senectute non defe∣cit.</HI></P>
<P>But his proficiency in Letters was
very much retarded by a Distemper
that seized on his Head; the Cure of
which was not effected under the space
of two years; and therefore occasion'd
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
great loss of time, as well as infinite
pain and torture of Body to one so
young and tender. For by reason of the
unskilfulness of Country Empericks
who first undertook him, the Flesh in
the fore-part of his Head rotted to the
Skull, where never any Hair came af∣terward.
And the Distemper again
returning upon him as the Flesh grew
up, he was in the 13th. year of his
Age sent to <HI>London</HI> by his Father, to
be under the Cure of Dr. <HI>Turner</HI> (Hus∣band
to that Gentlewoman that had a
hand in the Death of Sir <HI>Tho. Overbury</HI>)
who keeping him to a strict Diet and
frequent Sweatings, sent him back into
the Country after four Months time.
But his Distemper again returning, he
was fain once more to apply himself
unto his old Doctor, before a Cure
could be completed.</P>
<P>Upon his return to <HI>Burford,</HI> he found
his old Master dead, and was commit∣ted
to the Care of a Successor, <HI>viz.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Davis,</HI> a Reverend good man;
who notwithstanding his long discon∣tinuance
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
from School, found his Scho∣lar
not to have mis-spent or mis-em∣ployed
any time, that gave him the
least Relaxation from his Distemper,
and therefore placed him <HI>Third</HI> in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppermost Form. Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> spared
no diligence that might tend to the
cultivating of a Plant so flourishing and
hopeful, making him fit for the Uni∣versity
by having him but twelve
Months under his Tuition: A kind∣ness
so gratefully resented by our Do∣ctor,
that he dedicated to him one of
his Books, called <HI>Ecclesia Vindicata;</HI>
and had it not been for the misfortune
of the War, had given better Testimo∣nies
of a thankful and generous mind
in preferring him to some considerable
Benefice or Dignity in the Church.</P>
<P>He was the beginning of <HI>December,</HI>
1613. in the 14th. year of his Age sent
to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and placed under the Tuiti∣on
of Mr. <HI>Ioseph Hill,</HI> an antient Bat∣chelor
in Divinity, once one of the
Fellows of <HI>Corpus Christi College,</HI> but
then Commoner of <HI>Hart-Hall;</HI> by
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
whom Mr. <HI>Walter Newberry</HI> (after∣ward
a zealous Puritan) was made
choice of to instruct him in <HI>Logick,</HI>
and other Academical Studies, as far
as the tenderness of his Age rendred
him capable. And he made such pro∣gress
in them, that upon the 22d. of
<HI>Iuly,</HI> 1614. he stood Candidate for a
<HI>Demies</HI> place in <HI>Magdalen College,</HI> ha∣ving
no other Recommendations than
Sir <HI>Iohn Walters,</HI> then <HI>Attorney Gene∣ral</HI>
to the Prince, and afterward Lord
Chief <HI>Baron</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> Grand-Father
to that worthy Gentleman Sir
<HI>William Walter</HI> now of <HI>Sarsden</HI> in the
County of <HI>Oxford,</HI> Baronet. Dr. <HI>Lang∣ton,</HI>
President of the College, put Mr▪
<HI>Heylyn</HI> the <HI>Eighth</HI> upon the Roll;
which was the first place of the second
Course; but it succeeded not till the
year following, being then Elected
<HI>First</HI> upon the Roll, and having very
much endeared himself to the President
and Fellows by a facetious <HI>Latine</HI>
Poem upon a Journey that he made
with his two Tutors, unto <HI>Woodstock.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19"/>
But immediately after his admission
into that noble Foundation, he fell in∣to
a Consumption, which constrain∣ed
him to retire to his Native Air,
where he continued till <HI>Christmas</HI> fol∣lowing.
He was a year after his Ad∣mission
made <HI>Impositor</HI> of the Hall; in
which Office he acquitted himself with
so much Fidelity, that the College-Dean
continued him longer in it, than
any ever before; by which means he
contracted a great deal of Hatred and
Enmity from those Students that were
of his own standing, being called by
them the <HI>Perpetual Dictator.</HI> But he
diverted the violence of the Storm by
the assiduity of his Studies, and parti∣cularly
by Composing an <HI>English</HI> Tra∣gedy,
called <HI>Spurius;</HI> which was so
well approved of by some learned per∣sons
of that Foundation, that the <HI>Pre∣sident</HI>
caused it to be privately acted in
his own Lodgings.</P>
<P>In <HI>Iuly</HI> 1617. he obtained his <HI>Grace</HI>
for the degree of <HI>Batchelor of Arts,</HI> but
was not Presented to it till the <HI>October</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
following, by reason of the absence of
one of his <HI>Seniors,</HI> holding it unworthy
to prejudice another person for his own
Advancement. After the performance
of the <HI>Lent</HI>-Exercises for his Degree,
he fell into a Fever, which increasing
with great violence, at last turned into
a <HI>Tertian</HI> Ague, and caused him again
to retreat unto his Countrey Air;
which he enjoyed till the middle of
<HI>Iuly</HI> following, and then according to
the <HI>College</HI> Statutes (which require
that Exercise to be performed every
long Vacation by some <HI>Batchelor</HI> of
Arts) he began his <HI>Cosmographical</HI> Le∣ctures,
and finished them in the end
of the next <HI>August.</HI> His Reading of
those Lectures drew the whole So∣ciety
into a profound admiration of
his Learning and Abilities; insomuch
that before he had ended them, he
was admitted Fellow upon <HI>Probation,</HI>
in the place of one Mr. <HI>Love.</HI> And
that he might give a Testimony of his
grateful mind for so unexpected a Fa∣vour,
he writ a <HI>Latine</HI> Comedy, call'd
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
<HI>Theomachia,</HI> which he Composed and
Transcribed in a Fortnights space. On
<HI>Iuly</HI> 29. 1619. he was admitted <HI>in ve∣rum
&amp; perpetuum Socium;</HI> and not long
before was made <HI>Moderator</HI> of the <HI>Se∣nior</HI>
Form, which he retained above
two years: And within that compass
of time he began to write his <HI>Geogra∣phy,</HI>
accordingly as he designed when
he Read his <HI>Cosmographic</HI>-Lectures;
which Book he finish'd in little more
than two months, beginning it <HI>Feb.</HI> 22.
and completing it the 29th. of <HI>April</HI>
following. At the <HI>Act, Ann. Dom.</HI> 1620,
he was admitted <HI>Master of Arts;</HI> the
honor of which Degree was the more
remarkable, because that very year the
Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> Chancellor of the
University, signified his pleasure by
special Letters, that from that time for∣ward,
the <HI>Masters of Arts,</HI> who before
sate bare, should wear their Caps in
all <HI>Congregations</HI> and <HI>Convocations;</HI>
unto which Act of Grace his Lord∣ship
was induced by an humble Petiti∣on
presented to him by the <HI>Regent
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
Masters</HI> in behalf of themselves and
<HI>Non-Regents;</HI> as also by Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>
then <HI>Vice-Chancellor,</HI> who being pre∣acquainted
with the business, gave
great encouragement to proceed on∣ward
in it; and lastly by the indefa∣tigable
pains of one Master <HI>Clopton,
junior,</HI> of <HI>Corpus-Christi-Colledge,</HI> who
was the principal Solicitor in that Af∣fair.</P>
<P>His <HI>Geography</HI> was committed by
him to the perusal of some Learned
Friends, and being by them well ap∣proved,
he obtained his Fathers con∣sent
for the Printing of it; which was
done accordingly, <HI>November</HI> 7. 1621.
The first Copy of it was presented by
him to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, then
Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> unto whom he De∣dicated
it; and by whom, together
with its Author, it was very graci∣ously
received; being introduced into
the Princes Presence by Sir <HI>Robert
Carre,</HI> one of the Gentlemen of his
Highnesses Bed-Chamber, and since
Earl of <HI>Ancram;</HI> unto whose Care
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
Master <HI>Heylyn</HI> was commended by
the Lord <HI>Danvers,</HI> then at <HI>Cornbury</HI>
by reason of some bodily Indispositi∣on.
But after this Sun-shine of Favour
and Honor darted on him by the
Prince, there followed a Cloud which
darkened all his Joys: for in a few
months after, his Father died at <HI>Oxon</HI>
with an Ulcer in his Bladder, occasi∣oned
by the Stone, with which he
had been for many years grievously af∣flicted:
His Body was conveyed to
<HI>Lechlade</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> where he
was buried near his Wife, who died
six years before him of a Contagious
Fever, and lay in the Chancel of that
Parish-Church.</P>
<P><HI>Septemb.</HI> 15. 1622. he received <HI>Con∣firmation</HI>
from the hands of Bishop
<HI>Lake,</HI> in the Parish Church of <HI>Wells;</HI>
and in a short space after exhibited a
<HI>Certificate</HI> to Doctor <HI>Langton</HI> concern∣ing
his Age; by which means he ob∣tained
a <HI>Dispensation,</HI> notwithstanding
any Local Statutes to the contrary,
that he should not be compelled to
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
enter into <HI>Holy Orders</HI> till he was
Twenty four years of Age, according
to the time appointed, both in the
<HI>Canons</HI> of the Church, and the <HI>Statutes</HI>
of the Realm. And such were his fears
to enter upon the Study, as well as
undertake the profession of Divinity,
that it was not without great Relu∣ctance
and Difficulty on his own part,
as well as many weighty Arguments
and Persuasions of a very Learned and
Reverend person (Mr. <HI>Buckner</HI>) that he
applied himself unto <HI>Theology.</HI> Thus
<HI>Moses</HI> pleaded his Inability, and not∣withstanding
the express command of
the Almighty, refused to be sent upon
the Divine Embassie, persevering in
his unseasonable modesty, till God
threatned him with his Anger, as he
had before encouraged him with his
promises. But as the difficulties in Di∣vinity
made Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> for some time
to desist, so the sweetness and amabi∣lities
of that Study allured him to un∣dertake
the Profession. And therefore he
received the <HI>Orders</HI> of <HI>Deacon</HI> and
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
<HI>Priest</HI> (but at distant times) in St. <HI>Al∣dates</HI>
Church in <HI>Oxon</HI> from the Right
Reverend Bishop <HI>Howson.</HI> And when
he was Ordained <HI>Priest,</HI> he Preach'd the
Ordination Sermon upon those words
of our Blessed Saviour to St. <HI>Peter,</HI>
Luke 22. 32. <HI>And when thou art con∣verted,
strengthen thy Brethren.</HI> What
course and method he observed in his
Theological Studies, he tells of with
his own Pen; <Q>When
I began my Studies in
Divinity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theol. Vet.</HI> Pref. to the Reader.</NOTE> I thought no
course so proper and expedient for
me, as the way commended by King
<HI>Iames </HI></Q><HI>(which was, that young Stu∣dents
in Divinity should be excited to
study such Books as were
most agreeable in Doctrine
and Discipline to the
Church of</HI> England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Iames</HI> Instru∣ctions to the U∣niversity, <HI>Ian.</HI> 18. 1616.</NOTE> <HI>and
to bestow their time in
the Fathers and Councils, Schoolmen,
Histories, and Controversies, and not
to insist too long upon Compendiums and
Abbreviators, making them the grounds
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
of their Study</HI>) <Q>and opened at the
charges of Bishop <HI>Montague,</HI> though
not then a Bishop. For though I had
a good respect to the memory of <HI>Lu∣ther,</HI>
and the name of <HI>Calvin,</HI> as
those whose Writings had awakened
all these parts of <HI>Europe</HI> out of the ig∣norance
and superstition in which they
suffered, yet I always took them to be
men: men as obnoxious unto Error,
as subject to humane Frailty, and as
indulgent too unto their own Opini∣ons,
as any others whatsoever. The
little knowledge I had gained in the
course of Stories, had pre-acquainted
me with the <HI>Fiery Spirit</HI> of the one, and
the <HI>Busie Humor</HI> of the other; thought
thereupon unfit by Arch-Bishop
<HI>Cranmer</HI> and others, the chief Agents
in the <HI>Reformation</HI> of this Church, to
be employed as Instruments in that
weighty Business. Nor was I igno∣rant
how much they differed fsom us
in their <HI>Doctrinals</HI> and Forms of Go∣vernment.
And I was apt enough to
think, that they were no fit <HI>Guides</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
to direct my▪ Judgment in order to
the <HI>Discipline</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the
Church of <HI>England;</HI> to the establish∣ing
whereof they were held unuse∣ful;
and who both by their <HI>Practi∣ces</HI>
and <HI>Positions</HI> had declared them∣selves
Friends to neither.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Geography</HI> was in less than three
years Re-printed; and in this second
Edition Enlarged and again Presented
by him to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and
by him received with most affectionate
Commendations of the Author. But it
met with a far different entertainment
from K. <HI>Iames.</HI> For the Book being put
into the hands of that learned Monarch
by Dr. <HI>Young</HI> Dean of <HI>Winton</HI> (who
thereby designed nothing else but the
highest kindness to Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>) the
King at first expressed the great Value
he had for the Author: but unfortu∣nately
falling on a passage, wherein
Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> gave Precedency to the
<HI>French</HI> King, and called <HI>France the more
Famous Kingdom,</HI> King <HI>Iames</HI> became
very much offended, and ordered the
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
Lord <HI>Keeper</HI> that the Book should be
call'd in. The good <HI>Dean</HI> gave notice
to Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> of his Majesties Displea∣sure,
advising him to repair to <HI>Court,</HI>
and to make use of the Princes Patron∣age,
as the best lenitive to prevent the
rankling of this wound, lest it festered
and became incurable. But he rather
chose to abide at <HI>Oxon,</HI> acquainting the
Lord <HI>Danvers</HI> with the business, and
requesting his Advice and Intercession,
and sending afterward an Apology and
Explanation of his meaning to Doctor
<HI>Young,</HI> the substance of which was,
<Q>That some crimes are of a nature so
unjustifiable, that they are improved
by an Apology; yet considering the
purpose he had in those places, which
gave offence to his Sacred Majesty,
he was unwilling that his Innocence
should be condemn'd for want of an
Advocate: The burthen under
which he suffered was rather a mi∣stake
than a crime, and that mistake
not his own, but the Printers. For if
in the first line of <HI>page 441. was</HI> be
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
read instead of <HI>is,</HI> the sense runs as
he design'd it: And this appears from
the words immediately following;
for by them may be gathered the
sense of this corrected reading,<HI>When</HI>
Edward <HI>the Third quartered the Arms
of</HI> France <HI>and</HI> England, <HI>he gave Pre∣cedency
to the French; first, because</HI>
France <HI>was the greater and more fa∣mous
Kingdom. Secondly, That the
French,</HI> &amp;c. These Reasons are to be
referr'd to the time of that King, by
whom those Arms were first quartered
with the Arms of <HI>England,</HI> and who
desired by this honor done unto their
Arms to gain upon the good opinion
of that Nation, for the Crown and
Love whereof he was a Suitor. For
at this time (besides that it may seem
ridiculous to use a Verb of the pre∣sent
Tense in a matter done so long
ago) that Reason is not of the least
force or consequence; the French ha∣ving
so long since forgot the Rights
of <HI>England,</HI> and our late Princes claim∣ing
nothing but the Title only.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24"/>
<Q>The place and passage so corre∣cted,
I hope (says Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>) I may
without detraction from the Glory
of this Nation affirm, That <HI>France</HI> was
at this time the more famous King∣dom.
Our <HI>English</HI> Swords for more
than half the time since the <HI>Norman</HI>
Conquest had been turned against
our own Bosoms; and the Wars we
then made (except some fortunate
Excursions of King <HI>Edward</HI> the First
in <HI>France,</HI> and King <HI>Richard</HI> in the
<HI>Holy Land</HI>) in my conceit were ful∣ler
of Pity than of Honor. For what
was our Kingdom under the Reign of
<HI>Edward</HI> the Second, <HI>Henry</HI> the
Third, <HI>Iohn, Stephen</HI> and <HI>Rufus</HI> but
a publick Theatre, on which the Tra∣gedies
of Blood and civil Dissentions
had been continually acted? On the
other side, the <HI>French</HI> had exercised
their Arms with Credit and Renown
both in <HI>Syria, Palestine,</HI> and <HI>Egypt;</HI>
and had much added to the Glory of
their Name and Nation by Conquer∣ing
the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Si∣cily,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
and driving the <HI>English</HI> them∣selves
out of all <HI>France, Guyen</HI> only
excepted. If we look higher, we shall
find <HI>France</HI> to be the first Seat of the
<HI>Western</HI> Empire, and the Forces of it
to be known and felt by the <HI>Saracens</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and
the <HI>Lombards</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> at which time
the Valour of the <HI>English</HI> was impri∣soned
in the same Seas with their
Island: And therefore <HI>France</HI> was at
that time, when first the Arms were
quartered, the more famous King∣dom.
'Tis true indeed, since the time
of those victorious Princes, those
<HI>Duo Fulmina Belli, Edward</HI> the Third
and the <HI>Black Prince</HI> his Son, the
Arms of <HI>England</HI> have been exerci∣sed
in most parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Nor am
I ignorant how high we stand above
<HI>France</HI> and all other Nations in the
true fame of our Atchievements.
<HI>France</HI> it self divers times over-run,
and once Conquered, the House of
<HI>Burgundy</HI> upheld from Ruine, the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> Supported, <HI>Spain</HI> Awed
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
and the <HI>Ocean</HI> Commanded, are suf∣ficient
testimonies, that in pursuit of
Fame and Honor, we had no Equals.
That I was always of this opinion my
Book speaks for me (and indeed so
unworthy a person needs no better
an Advocate) in which I have been
no where wanting to commit to me∣mory
the honorable performances of
my Countrey. The great <HI>Annalist
Baronius</HI> pretending only a true and
sincere History of the Church, yet
tells the <HI>Pope</HI> in his Epistle Dedicato∣ry,
that he principally did intend
that work, <HI>pro Sacrarum Traditionum
Antiquitate, &amp; Authoritate Romanae
Ecclesiae.</HI> The like may I say of my
self, though not with like imputation
of Imposture. I promised a Descri∣ption
of all the World, and have ac∣cording
to the measure of my poor
Abilities fully performed it: yet
have I apprehended withal every mo∣dest
occasion of enobling and extol∣ling
the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers and Kings of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
Besides that I do not now speak
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
of <HI>England</HI> as it now stands aug∣mented
with, by the happy Additi∣on
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I had had it from an
Author, whom in poverty of read∣ing
I conceived above all exception,
<HI>viz. Cambden Clarencieux,</HI> that gene∣ral
and accomplish'd Scholar in the
fifth part of his <HI>Remains,</HI> had so in∣formed
me. If there be error in it,
'tis not mine but my Authors. The
Precedency which he there speaks of
is in <HI>General Councils.</HI> And I do hear∣tily
wish it would please the Lord to
give such a sudden Blessing to his
Church, that I might live to see Mr.
<HI>Cambden</HI> Confuted by so good an Ar∣gument
as the sitting of a <HI>General
Council.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> was the interpre∣ter
of his own words; and by these
demonstrations of his integrity, King
<HI>Iames</HI>'s indignation was appeased, and
his own fears were ended: Only he took
care to have these offensive words blot∣ted
out of his Book, as the Dean of
<HI>Winton</HI> advised him.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
In the year 1625. he took a Jour∣ney
with Mr. <HI>Levet</HI> of <HI>Lincolns-Inn</HI> in∣to
<HI>France,</HI> where he visited more Ci∣ties,
and made more Observations in
the space of five weeks (for he staid
there no longer) than many others
have done in so many years. The par∣ticulars
of this Journey he put in Wri∣ting,
and some years after gratified his
Countrey with the Publication of it,
together with some other very excel∣lent
Remarks made by him, when he
attended upon the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> to
the Isles of <HI>Guernsey</HI> and <HI>Iersey, Anno
Dom.</HI> 1628. Had King <HI>Iames</HI> lived to
have perused that Book, Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>
had needed no other Advocate to have
restored him to his Princely Favour
and Protection. For never was the
Vanity and Levity of the <HI>Monsieurs,</HI>
and the Deformity and Sluttishness of
their <HI>Madames</HI> more ingeniously expo∣sed
both in Prose and Verse, than in
the Account that he gives of his Voy∣age
into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
On <HI>April</HI> 18. 1627. he opposed in
the <HI>Divinity-School,</HI> and the 24th. day
following he answered <HI>pro Forma</HI> upon
these two Questions, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L>An. Ecclesia unquam fuerit invisibilis?</L>
<L>An Ecclesia possit errare?</L></Q>
Both which he determined in the <HI>Ne∣gative:</HI>
And in stating of the first, he
fell upon a different way from that of
Doctor <HI>Prideaux</HI> in his
Lecture <HI>de Visibilitate
Ecclesiae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix to the <HI>Adv.</HI> on Mr. <HI>San∣derson</HI>'s Histories.</NOTE> and other
Tractates of and a∣bout
that time; in which the visibility
of the Protestant Church (and conse∣quently
of the Renowned Church of
<HI>England</HI>) was no otherwise proved,
than by looking for it into the scatter∣ed
Conventicles of the <HI>Berengarians</HI> in
<HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Waldenses</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> the
<HI>Wickliffs</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Hussites</HI>
in <HI>Bohemia;</HI> which manner of proceed∣ing
not being liked by Mr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> be∣cause
it utterly discontinued that Suc∣cession
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
in the <HI>Ecclesiastical Hierarchy,</HI>
which the Church of <HI>England</HI> claims
from the Apostles; he rather chose to
look for a continual Visible Church in
<HI>Asia, Aethiopia, Greece, Italy,</HI> yea and
<HI>Rome</HI> it self; as also in all the <HI>Western</HI>
Provinces then subject to the power of
the Popes thereof: And for the proof
whereof he shewed, 1. That the
Church of <HI>England</HI> received no Suc∣cession
of Doctrine or Government
from any of the scattered <HI>Conventicles</HI>
before remembred. 2. That the <HI>Wick∣liffes,</HI>
together with the rest (before
remembred) held many <HI>Heterodoxies</HI>
in Religion, as different from the Esta∣blish'd
Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
as any point that was maintained
at that time in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI>
And 3. That the Learned Writers of
that Church, and <HI>Bellarmin</HI> himself a∣mong
them have stood up as cordially
and stoutly in maintenance of some
Fundamental points of the Christian
Faith against <HI>Socinians, Anabaptists</HI> and
<HI>Anti-Trinitarians,</HI> and other Hereticks
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
of these Ages, as any of the Divines
and other Learned men of the Prote∣stant
Churches; which point Mr. <HI>Hey∣lyn</HI>
closed with these words, <HI>viz. Vti∣nam
quod ipse de Calvino, sic semper er∣rasset
nobilissimus Cardinalis.</HI> And this
so much displeased the <HI>Doctor of the
Chair,</HI> that so soon as our young Di∣vine
had ended his <HI>Determination,</HI> he
fell most heavily upon him, calling him
by the most odious names of <HI>Papicola,
Bellarminianus, Pontificius,</HI> &amp;c. bitter∣ly
complaining to the younger part of
his Audients (unto whom he made the
greatest part of his Addresses) of the
unprofitable pains he had took amongst
them, if <HI>Bellarmin,</HI> whom he had la∣boured
to decry for so many years,
should now be honored with the Title
of <HI>Nobilissimus.</HI> The like he did with∣in
a few days after (<HI>Tantaene animis
coelestibus irae?</HI>) when the <HI>Respondent</HI> be∣came
<HI>prior Oppenent,</HI> loading him with
so many Reproaches, that he was
branded for a <HI>Papist</HI> before he under∣stood
what Popery was. And because
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
this Report should not prepossess the
minds of some great Persons, the <HI>Di∣sputant</HI>
went to <HI>London;</HI> and after the
Lord <HI>Chamberlain</HI> had ordered him to
Preach before the Kings Houshold,
Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> then Bishop of
<HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> took notice of the pas∣sages
that had happened at <HI>Oxford.</HI> But
Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> told him the story at large,
and for a farther testimony of his Judg∣ment
and Innocency, gave him a Copy
of his <HI>Supposition;</HI> which, when it was
perused, the <HI>Disputant</HI> waited on him,
and his Lordship made him to sit down
by him, and after enquiry made into
the course of his Studies, told him,
<Q>That his <HI>Supposition</HI> was strongly
grounded, and not to be over thrown
in a fair way of Scholastick Argu∣ing,
That he would not have him be
discouraged by noise and clamour.
That he himself had in his younger
days maintained the same <HI>Positions</HI> in
Disputation in St. <HI>Iohns College,</HI> for
which he was much blamed by Arch-Bishop
<HI>Abbot,</HI> then Vice-Chancellor,
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
and made a <HI>By-word</HI> and <HI>Reproach</HI> in
the University. Finally he exhorted
him to continue in that moderate
course, telling him, That as God had
given him more than ordinary Gifts,
so he would pray to God that he
might employ them in such a way
and manner, as might make up the
Breaches in the Walls of Christen∣dom.</Q>
The Discourse between them
continued for the space of two hours,
<HI>Amotis Arbitris.</HI> For he ordered his
Servants that no one should come to
him on any occasion before he called.</P>
<P>But this was not all that was done then
by our young Divine to secure him∣self
from the Reproach of a <HI>Papist.</HI>
For in <HI>November</HI> next following, he
Preached before the King on those
words, <HI>Iohn 4. 20. Our Fathers wor∣shipped
on this Mountain.</HI> In which Ser∣mon
he declared himself with such
warm zeal against some Errors and Cor∣ruptions
in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, that he
shewed himself to be far enough from
any inclination to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion,
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
But his innocency in that matter will
be made more apparent in some follow∣ing
passages of his Life.</P>
<P>Unto one of the most principal parts
of which the Reader is now invited,
<HI>viz.</HI> his Marriage, which was so far
from being <HI>Clandestine</HI> and <HI>Clancular</HI>
(as it was objected to him in Print a∣bove
thirty years after its solemnizati∣on)
that he ordered it to be performed
upon St. <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Iudes</HI> day, between
ten and eleven of the Clock in the
morning in his own <HI>College-Chappel,</HI>
which by his appointment was set out
with the richest Ornaments, in the pre∣sence
of a sufficient number of Wit∣nesses
of both Sexes, according to Law
and Practice. The Wedding-Dinner
was kept in his own Chamber, some
Doctors and their Wives, with five or
six of the Society being invited to it.
Mrs. <HI>Bride</HI> was placed at the head of the
Table, the Town-Musick playing, and
himself waiting most part of the Din∣ner,
and no Formality wanting which
was accustomably required (even to
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
the very giving of Gloves) at the most
solemn Wedding. These things are
more particularly related, because some
of his Enemies, having nothing else
with which they could blast his Re∣putation,
were pleased to accuse him
of a <HI>Clandestine</HI> Marriage, and that he
was obliged in Conscience to restore
all the Emoluments that he had recei∣ved
from his Fellowship between that
time and his Resignation. <HI>But what shall
be given to thee, or what shall be done
unto thee, thou false tongue?</HI> It seems it
must be injustice in Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> to re∣ceive
his share of an half-years Divi∣dent,
which was usually allowed to
persons in his circumstances, but it was
no act of unrighteousness in other men
to take bread out of the mouths of
young Students, and send them to
wander in solitary ways, being <HI>hungry
and thirsty, and their souls ready to
faint in them.</HI> The Ceremony was per∣formed
by his faithful and ingenuous
friend Dr. <HI>Allibond;</HI> and the person
that he made choice of for his Wife
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>
was Mrs. <HI>Laetitia Heygate,</HI> third Daugh∣ter
of <HI>Thomas Heygate</HI> of <HI>Heys</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
one of his Majesties Justices of Peace
for the County of <HI>Middlesex</HI> (who in
his younger days, whilst his elder Bro∣ther
was alive, had been <HI>Provost-Mar∣shal-General</HI>
of the Army under the
Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> at the Action of <HI>Cales</HI>)
and of <HI>Margery Skipwith</HI> his Wife, one
of the Daughters of—<HI>Skipwith</HI> of—
in the County of <HI>Leicester,</HI> a Family
of good note and credit in those parts.
Which said <HI>Thomas Heygate</HI> the Father
was second Son of that <HI>Thomas Hey∣gate,</HI>
who was <HI>Field-Marshal-General</HI>
of the <HI>English</HI> Forces before St. <HI>Quin∣tins,</HI>
under the Command of the Earl
of <HI>Pembroke, Anno Dom.</HI> 1557. and
of—<HI>Stonner</HI> his Wife, a Daughter of
the antient Family of the <HI>Stonners</HI> in
<HI>Oxfordshire.</HI></P>
<P>These particulars are set down by
our learned Doctor in his little <HI>Manu∣script</HI>
to this end, <HI>That Posterity might
know from what Roots they sprang, and
not engage in any thing unworthy their
<PB N="34" REF="31"/>
Extraction.</HI> 'Tis an inestimable blessing
for any one to be well Born and De∣scended,
but the present guilt and fu∣ture
account of that person will be in∣creased
who blemishes and stains his
Family by unworthy and ill-done acti∣ons.</P>
<P>Continuing this time, Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>
had no very considerable subsistence for
himself and his new Companion. For
the Portion which he was to have
by her (being a thousand pounds) was
never paid, many irreparable losses and
mis-fortunes happening to her eldest
Brother, which he was not able to re∣cover,
though left by his Father in the
possession of 800 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI> His
Fellowship he resigned, and although
he had the Advowson of <HI>Bradwel,</HI> a
very good Living in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> left
him by his Father, together with a Rent-charge
of Inheritance paid him out of
the <HI>Mannor</HI> of <HI>Lechlade,</HI> yet he was
constrained for a while to wrestle with
some necessities and frowns of Fortune.
He parted with his Title to <HI>Bradwel,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="31"/>
resolving to lay the foundation of his
future Felicity in this world by his own
honest industry, and not bury him∣self
in the obscurity of a Rural Life.
His noble Friend, the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI>
whom he attended in the quality of a
Chaplain to the Isles of <HI>Guernsey</HI> and
<HI>Iersey</HI> (his own Chaplains modestly
refusing a Voyage which they concei∣ved
to be troublesome and dangerous)
was not a little troubled to see such ex∣traordinary
merits continue still dis∣couraged
and unrewarded; and there∣fore
out of his generous Nature pre∣sented
him to the great Judg and <HI>Me∣coenas</HI>
of Learning, Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI>
then Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> who making a
second and more narrow enquiry into
his Temporal concerns, appointed him
to meet him Court, which not long af∣ter
was to remove to <HI>Woodstock.</HI> But
his Lordship fell sick at <HI>Reading;</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> met with some rude usages
in the Kings Chappel, which was tal∣ked
of the more at <HI>Oxon,</HI> the interest
he had at Court being universally
<PB N="36" REF="32"/>
known in that University. But it was
not very many months after, that
power was given him to revenge the
Affront, being admitted Chaplain in
<HI>Ordinary</HI> to the King, and into great
Favour with the <HI>Grandees</HI> of that time.
But a soul enobled with the principles
of Gratitude and Generosity is as a∣verse
to retaliate, as to do an injury.
The first person therefore, unto whom
he paid his thankful Acknowledgments
for his honorable Preferment, was the
Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> who presently told him,
<Q>That those thanks were not in the
least due unto himself, but to the
Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> unto whose
generous and active mind the whole
of that Dignity was to be ascribed.</Q>
Upon which hint he attended upon the
Bishop; who after he had wish'd him
happiness in his new Preferment, gave
him some particular Instructions for his
behaviour in it, which he carefully ob∣served
the whole time of his Atten∣dance
upon the Sacred Person of his
gracious Master.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="32"/>
Having thus gained the advantage
of this rising ground, he found out an
honest Art by which he might recom∣mend
himself to the Patronage of some
noble mind; and that was to assert the
History of St. <HI>George,</HI> Patron of the
most noble <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Garter, A bu∣siness</HI>
(as he tells the King in his Epistle
Dedicatory) <HI>of so intricate and invol∣ved
a nature, that he had no Guide to
follow, nor any Path to tread, but what
he had made unto himself.</HI> Neither had
that Task ever come to perfection, had
not so able an hand undertaken it,
whose industry and abilities were supe∣rior
to every thing but themselves. Ma∣ny
enemies the Book met withal, when
it came first to light. But 'tis more easie
to load learned Authors with Railing
and Reproaches, than to Encounter and
Confute their Arguments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Historian</HI> had the honor to be
introduced by the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> in∣to
his Masters Bed-Chamber, unto
whom he presented his Book, which
his Majesty graciously accepted, and
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>
held some conference with the Author
about the subject-matter contained in
it. He also gave Copies of the Histo∣ry
to all the Knights of the Order, that
were then attending at Court, who all
used him with respect suitable to his
merits, except the Earl of <HI>E.</HI> who cal∣led
him a <HI>begging Scholar;</HI> of which
words he was afterward very much a∣shamed,
when the incivility unbecom∣ing
a Nobleman and Courtier, came to
the knowledge of those that were of
hiw own Quality. Against this <HI>History</HI>
Doctor <HI>Hackwel</HI> appeared in Print; of
which the King was presently informed,
and sending for Mr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> comman∣ded
him to consider the Arguments of
his <HI>Antagonist,</HI> and withal sent him to
<HI>Windsor</HI> to search into the <HI>Records</HI> of
the <HI>Order.</HI> This occasioned a second
Edition of the <HI>History,</HI> wherein were
answered all the Doctors Arguments
and Allegations, but no Reply made
to his Invectives, which were too fre∣quently
interspersed in the Book of that
learned Writer; of whom Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="33"/>
heard no more till his very excellent
Book about the <HI>Supposed Decay of Na∣ture</HI>
came out in a new Edition, where∣in
there was a Retractation made of
those passages that related to St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> began now to conceive
some hopes of not being any longer un∣kindly
dealt withal by the hand of
Fortune, having a <HI>Presentation</HI> given
him by one Mr. <HI>Bridges</HI> to the Parson∣age
of <HI>Meysie-Hampton</HI> in the Diocess
of <HI>Glocester;</HI> unto the Bishop of which
he made Application, but found him
already pre-engaged to further the pre∣tended
Title of <HI>Corpus Christi College</HI>
in <HI>Oxon.</HI> However his Lordship promi∣sed
not to give <HI>Institution</HI> to any person,
till the Title was cleared; advising Mr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI> to leave his <HI>Presentation</HI> with
him, and to enter a <HI>Caveat</HI> in his Court.
But he who was false to God and his
Mother-Church, could never be faith∣ful
to those engagements thich <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
made to man; the one he deserted by
turning <HI>Papist,</HI> being the only Bishop
of the <HI>English</HI> Hierarchy, who re∣nounced
<PB N="40" REF="34"/>
a Persecuted Church to em∣brace
the Errors and Idolatries of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Communion: And as for his
promises to Mr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> those he vio∣lated,
giving one Mr. <HI>Iackson</HI> who was
presented by <HI>C.C.C. Institution</HI> so soon
as ever he requested it. This engaged
our young Married Divine in a tedious
Suit at Law, which occasioned him
great trouble, and that which he could
not well at that time undergo, vast
charge and expence; especially if we con∣sider
the bad success that attended it. For
by reason of the absence of many of
the <HI>Iury,</HI> and the supply of <HI>Tales</HI> (who
attended upon the Trial as Water-men
wait for a <HI>Fare</HI>) together with the Ter∣giversation
or rather Treachery of one
of his <HI>Council,</HI> upon whose Wisdom
and Integrity the <HI>Client</HI> most relied,
the Cause went against him, though
affirmed by all <HI>Standers-by,</HI> and by the
<HI>Council</HI> himself the night immediately
preceding the Trial, to be as fair and
just an Action as ever was brought to
Bar. But <HI>indignus es felictate, quem
<PB N="41" REF="34"/>
fortuitorum pudet.</HI> It was not the first
time that a poor man was oppressed
and a righteous Cause miscarried. And
God ever rewards the quiet submission
of his faithful Servants to his wise and
unsearchable Providence with far more
valuable Blessings, than those which
he deprives or with-holds from them.
<HI>Ioseph</HI> had never met with those signal
honors and dignities in <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Court,
had not he been first sold by his Bre∣thren
for a Bond-slave into <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Neither was this the only disappoint∣ment
he met with in his way to Pre∣ferment.
For not long after, Preaching
at Court in his second Attendance, his
Majesty expressed a very high opinion
of him to many noble Lords about
him, and in a few months after gave
him a <HI>Presentation</HI> to the Rectory of
<HI>Hemingford</HI> in the County of <HI>Hunting∣ton.</HI>
But this also missed of the desired
effect, which his Majesties Bounty and
Mr. <HI>Heylyns</HI> necessities required. For
the Bishop of <HI>Linclon,</HI> unto whom he
made Application with his <HI>Presenta∣tion,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="35"/>
would not allow the King to have
any Title to the Living; so that the
poor man was fain to return to <HI>London
re infectâ.</HI> The Bishop was much of∣fended
as well as surprized that a
young Divine should have so compre∣hensive
a knowledg of the Law. For he
made good the Kings Right upon the
passages of the Conveyances of the
other party. But the King soon un∣derstood
the entertainment his Chap∣lain
met with at <HI>Bugden,</HI> and sent him
this gracious Message, <HI>That he was sor∣ry
he had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him to so much charge
and trouble, but it should not be long
before he would be out of his debt.</HI> And
he soon performed his Royall promise;
for within a week after, he bestowed
on him a <HI>Prebe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dship</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI>
(void by the death of Dr. <HI>Darrel</HI>) to
the extreme vexation of his Lordship,
who was then <HI>Dean</HI> of the same
Church. And that which added to the
honor of this Preferment, was his not
only being the same day ini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iated into
the friendship of the <HI>Attorney-General,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="35"/>
Mr. <HI>Noye,</HI> but the condescending Mes∣sage
that came along with the Royal
Gift, <HI>viz. That he bestowed that Pre∣bendship
on him to bear the charges of
his last Iourney, but he was still in his
debt for the Living.</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> was
deserted by his Parents for fear of
<HI>Pharaohs</HI> fury, God was pleased to
provide him a Saviour and a Nurse;
and he was taken out of the Bul-rushes,
and fed and preserved in despight of
all his enemies.</P>
<P>Being possessed of this Preferment,
he began the repairing and beautifying
of his House, with many other things,
so far as his narrow contracted Fortune
would permit him. And the first ho∣norable
Visit that he received in his
new Habitation, was from the learned
Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> who brought along
with him one Captain <HI>Nelson,</HI> that
pretended a new Invention, <HI>viz. The
Discovery of the Longitude of the Sea.</HI>
The Captain had imparted his design
to many learned <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> who
by no means could approve of, or sub∣scribe
<PB N="44" REF="36"/>
to his Demonstrations. But the
King referr'd him to Mr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> who
told that noble Lord, That his Majesty
was mistaken in him; his skill and
knowledg lying more in the <HI>Historica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
than <HI>Philosophical</HI> part of <HI>Geography▪</HI>
His Lordship seem'd much offended
with the answer, conceiving that out
of a supercilious disdain of the old
Captain, Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> declined the bu∣siness.
But he presently rectified his
Lordships mis-apprehensions, assuring
his Honor that he would confer with
some learned men about that <HI>Hypothe∣sis,</HI>
and by previous Study fit and pre∣pare
himself to discourse it with them,
and in a short time give the King and
his Lordship an account of what he
did in the business. With this his Lord∣ship
went away satisfied, and commen∣ded
to Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> he acquaintance of
Mr. <HI>Oughtred,</HI> as he ablest person to
be consulted in an affair of that nature.
Some Letters also passed between his
Lordship and Mr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> in which his
Lordship commended the <Q>honest old
<PB N="45" REF="36"/>
Captain to his Religious and Judici∣ous
care and consideration, telling
him that in the credibility of that
<HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> his Majesties Resolu∣tion
would be very much guided by
his Judgment, which he found would
be of special Authority with him:
That he press'd the point the oftner to
him, because he conceived it a duty
which he owed to the Truth it self to
have it made manifest one way or
other; that is, either to be freed from
the Captains Imposition and Pre∣tence,
if upon trial it appeared to be
fallacious; or else to be approved and
declared for right and perfect (if such
it be) to the perpetual silencing of all
malicious impugners thereof, that
the world may be deprived no lon∣ger
of the participation and use of so
publick and common a Benefit.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> being backward in no∣thing,
wherein he might be really ser∣viceable
to any one part of Learning,
went to Mr. <HI>Oughtred,</HI> with whom he
had much discourse concerning the Ca∣ptains
<PB N="46" REF="37"/>
<HI>Hypothesis.</HI> Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> told
his Visitant, that the Captain was ve∣ry
much mistaken in his Principle;
which he made afterward appear unto
the Captain at <HI>London,</HI> and gave this
following account of it in a Letter to
Mr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI>—<Q>I asked him the
ground whereon he went, and tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him the difficulties which other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
found. His ground, he said, was by
the Nodes of the Moons Circle, be∣cause
the Moon accompanies the
Earth, having it the Center of her
Orb. The difficulties which others
imagined was the finding out of the
place of the Node or ☊ upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
superficies of the Earth. His Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ple
I determine to omit till more le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sure
(for I had but one whole day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
stay in <HI>London.</HI>) The difficulty of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
place of ☊ I saw factible at Sea, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
accordingly let him understand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪
Now being at <HI>London,</HI> I desired co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ference
with him, and thus I pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ceeded.
You require for the discov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ry
of the Longitude, the place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="47" REF="37"/>
upon the earth. Well, imagine you
were now at Sea in an unknown
place, and what I gave you in de∣grees
of Longitude, the distance of
☊ from that place where you are;
what will you conclude? He was en∣tring
into I know not what by-de∣mands
of <HI>If this,</HI> or <HI>If that;</HI> but I
held him to the Question in the <HI>Hy∣pothesis,</HI>
telling him he had what he
required. At last he answered, Why
methinks you have done it already
your self. You have the distance of
☊ in the degrees of Longitude of ☊
from an unknown place, and there∣fore
the difference of the ☊ is also
unknown, except to that place only.
But we required the distance from
the other known place which you
promised to argue. At last he began
to be sensible of his mistake, and I
advised him to desist from such un∣dertakings;
and being of so great an
Age, to labour the Discovery of an∣other
Voyage, or rather only labour
to attain to the blessed end thereof,
<PB N="48" REF="38"/>
being already opened to us by our
Saviour. And this was the end of our
Communication, and will be I sup∣pose
of that business also. I wonder
how the Captain for these twelve
years, wherein he hath mused upon
this, and hath had conference with so
many learned men, would receive no
answer. But it seems they gave him
too much liberty of digression; and
he having a very ill expression of his
of his confused Conceits, intangled
himself more and more in perplexi∣ties.</Q></P>
<P>Thus this business ended; but before
it was brought to this issue, there was
an end put to the life of that learned
Lord. However Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> continued
his endeavours in the business, till the
Captain was convinced of his mistake.
Had the poor Captain lived unto these
days, wherein Philosophy has met
with such wonderful improvements,
'tis not unlikely but that he might have
had the honor of giving the first hint
of the truth of that <HI>Hypothesis.</HI> For I
<PB N="49" REF="38"/>
have been informed from a good hand,
that Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> the great pattern of
modesty and industry, did not many
years since in his Lectures at <HI>Gresham-College</HI>
read upon this very subject;
and divers of his Auditors as well as
himself were of opinion, that he had
really found out and demonstrated the
<HI>Seas Longitude.</HI> And perhaps what is
here inserted from Mr. <HI>Oughtred</HI> may
invite him to oblige his Country with
what he was written upon that <HI>Hypo∣thesis.</HI></P>
<P>But to make our return unto the
subject of these Papers; whose mind
was intent rather upon useful than no∣tional
Learning; and therefore about
this time he began with great diligence
to read over the <HI>Statute-Laws</HI> of the
Nation, and to compare them with the
times and circumstances that occurr'd
in Story: and this he did with the
greatest care, to enable himself for the
service of his Royal Master, who then
had the Small-Pox appearing on him,
but soon recovered of that Distemper:
<PB N="50" REF="39"/>
and our young Divine to testifie his
joy, turned <HI>Poet,</HI> making a Copy of
<HI>English</HI> Verses, which were presented
by one of his Friends to his Majesty;
and they were so well liked, that both
their Majesties gave him the honor of
their thanks.</P>
<P>But the King found Improvement
rather for the Judgment than Fancy of
his Chaplain; and therefore <HI>Ian.</HI> 27.
1632. s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt for him to the <HI>Council-Table,</HI>
where he received his Royal Com∣mands
to read over that Book of Mr.
<HI>Pryns,</HI> called <HI>Histriomastix;</HI> and to
collect thence all such passages, as were
scandalous or dangerous to the King or
State, and to reduce them into method.
The Book was delivered to him, and a
fortnights time assigned him to perform
the task imposed. But he had learned
from the wisest of men, That <HI>diligence
in business</HI> and a quick dispatch of it
would qualifie him for the service of
Kings, and not <HI>mean persons.</HI> And
therefore he performed what he un∣dertook,
and carried it to the <HI>Secretary</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="39"/>
of State in less than four days; for
which he had his Majesties thanks, as
also new Commands to revise his Pa∣pers,
and to write down such logical
Inferences as might naturally arise from
the Premisses of Mr. <HI>Pryn.</HI> Which task
was accordingly done by him, but ei∣ther
the Papers were lost, or at least
pretended to be so. And he received a
third Command to deliver his own
Copy to the <HI>Attorney-General;</HI> and a∣bout
this time, and upon this occasion
wrote a small Tract touching the pu∣nishments
due by Law, and in point
of practice unto such Offenders as Mr.
<HI>Pryn.</HI> And this was observable in the
Trial of that person, that nothing was
urged by the <HI>Counil</HI> to aggravate his
Faults, but what was contained in the
Collections made by Mr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></P>
<P>For a reward of these and other Ser∣vices,
his Majesty bestowed on him
the Parsonage of <HI>Houghton,</HI> in the Bi∣shoprick
of <HI>Durham,</HI> now let for above
470 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> and made void by the
preferment of Dr. <HI>Lendsel</HI> to the See of
<PB N="52" REF="40"/>
<HI>Peterborough;</HI> and ordered Mr. Secre∣tary
<HI>Windebank</HI> to take care for the
Broad Seal; but within a few hours
after intimated his Royal Pleasure to
him by the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> <Q>that
it should be exchanged for some other
Living nearer hand, and more for the
convenience of his Chaplain, his Ma∣jesty
conceiving that he might have
frequent occasion to make use of his
service, and therefore was unwilling
that he should have any Preferment
that was so far distant from his
Court.</Q> Upon this Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> entred
into a Treaty with Dr. <HI>Marshal</HI> for the
Parsonage of <HI>Alreford</HI> in <HI>Hampshire;</HI>
where the first thing he did after <HI>Insti∣stution</HI>
and <HI>Induction,</HI> was to order the
daily Reading of Morning-Prayer, be∣ing
a populous Market-Town, which
gave very great content unto the peo∣ple.
And being <HI>Ordinary</HI> of the place,
he removed the <HI>Communion-Table</HI> to the
<HI>East</HI> end of the Chancel; the decency
of which act, he not only justified by
Reason, convincing the people how
<PB N="53" REF="40"/>
much it had been profaned by sitting
on it, Scribling and casting Hats on it
in Sermon time, and at other times pas∣sing
the Parish Accounts, and dispu∣ting
businesses of like nature; and
which was worst of all, by Dogs pis∣sing
against it, and sometimes snatch∣ing
away the Bread that was provided
for the use of the Blessed Sacrament,
but by the place and posture which the
<HI>Communion-Table</HI> and Altars had been
situated in former times. And in a
short time after, this act of his was
justified and confirmed by what his
Majesty determined in the case of St.
<HI>Gregories</HI> Church near St. <HI>Pauls, Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P>But before these things happened, he
took his Degree of <HI>Batchelor</HI> in Divi∣nity,
<HI>viz.</HI> In <HI>Iuly</HI> 1630. his <HI>Latine</HI> Ser∣mon
was upon those words, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 19.
<HI>Faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.</HI>
Upon the <HI>Sunday</HI> followi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g (being the
time of the <HI>Act</HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Preached in the
Afternoon on <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 25. In which
<PB N="54" REF="41"/>
Sermon he discovered the great <HI>Mystery
of Iniquity</HI> that lay under the specious
pretext of <HI>Feoffees</HI> for buying in of <HI>Im∣propriations.</HI>
And he was the first per∣son
that ever gave notice of the dan∣ger
of it to the undeceiving of the peo∣ple.
What he said concerning it made a
loud clamour throughout the whole
Nation, and was one of the first things
that exposed him to the implacable ha∣tred
and malice of a restless Faction.
At first he looked upon the project
with as great reverence and affection,
as any that were deceived and abused
by it; and could not but congratulate
the felicity of those times, in giving
birth to a design of such signal merit.
But when he look'd more narrowly in∣to
the mannagement and conduct of
it, he apprehended it to be (as in∣deed
it was) the most pernicious im∣posture
that ever since the Reforma∣tion
was imposed upon the people;
and the most dangerous device to
subvert the Church and undermine
<PB N="55" REF="41"/>
Episcopal Power and Jurisdiction.
And having satisfied himself in the
danger of it, he conceived it his boun∣den
duty to give notice of it to other
men; that being once discovered and
set out in its proper Colours, it might
be taken into deeper consideration,
than had been to that time observed
if it. The Sermon was Preach'd <HI>Iuly</HI>
11. and the passage in it which con∣cern'd
the <HI>Feoffees</HI> was in these words,
<Q>Planting of Pensionary-Lecturers in
so many places where it needs not,
and upon days of common labour,
will at last bring forth those fruits,
that will appear to be a Tare indeed,
though now no Wheat be accounted
fairer. For what is that which is most
aimed at in it, but to cry down the
standing Clergy of this Kingdom, to
undermine the Publick Liturgy by
Law Established, to foment Fa∣ctions
in the State, Schisms in the
Church, and to have ready Sticklers
in every place for the Advancement
of some dangerous and deep Design?
<PB N="56" REF="42"/>
And now we are fallen upon this
point, we will proceed a little far∣ther
in the proposal of some things to
be considered. The Corporation of
<HI>Feoffees</HI> for buying of <HI>Impropriations</HI>
to the Church, doth it not seem in
the appearance to be an excellent
piece of Wheat, a noble and gracious
part of Piety? Is not this <HI>Templum
Domini, Templum Domini?</HI> But bles∣sed
God! that men should thus draw
near to Thee with their mouths and
be so far from Thee in their hearts!
For what are those entrusted in the
managing of this great Business? Are
they not most of them the most a∣ctive
and best affected men in the
whole cause, and <HI>Magna partium mo∣menta,</HI>
chief Patrons of this grow∣ing
Faction? And what are those that
they prefer? Are they not most of
them such men as are and must be
serviceable unto their dangerous In∣novations?
And will they not in
time have more Pref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rments to be∣stow
than all the Bishops of the King∣dom?
<PB N="57" REF="42"/>
And so by consequence a
greater number of Dependents to
promote their Interest? yet all this
while we sleep and slumber and fold
our hands in sloth, and see perhaps,
but dare not note it. High time it is
assuredly you should be awaked and
rouze up your selves upon the appre∣hension
of so near a danger.</Q> The
noise and calumnies that were raised
and fixed upon Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> after this
Sermon, incited him to make a more
narrow search into the matter, and to
multiply as well as strengthen his for∣mer
Arguments, which he delivered to
his endeared Friend Mr. <HI>Noye,</HI> who un∣dertook
the suppression of the <HI>Feoffees</HI>
in the Kings name; and they were ac∣cordingly
suppressed in a judicial way
of proceeding in the <HI>Exchequer-Cham∣ber,</HI>
Feb. 13. 1633.</P>
<P>In which year Mr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> com∣menc'd his
Degree of Doctor in Divi∣nity;
an honor not usually in those
days conferr'd upon men of such green
years; but he verfied those excellent
<PB N="58" REF="43"/>
words of the Son of <HI>Syrach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisdom 4. 8, 9.</NOTE>
<HI>That honorable Age is not
that which stands in length of
time, nor that which is measured by
number of years, but Wisdom is the gray
hair unto men, and an unspotted life is
old age.</HI> He entertained some hopes that
those prejudices and heats which for
some years past he had fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at <HI>Oxon,</HI>
had been cooled and allayed; and that
the remembrance of them was quite
buried by Dr. <HI>Prideaux,</HI> having so long
a tract of time as from 1627. to 1633.
to forget them. In his first Disputation
he had insisted on the Churches <HI>Visi∣bility;</HI>
and now he resolved to assert
and establish its <HI>Authority:</HI> and to that
purpose made choice to answer upon
these three Questions for his Degree of
Doctor,
<LIST>
<HEAD>An Ecclesia ha∣beat

All which he held in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI>
according to the plain and positive
Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in
the 20th. <HI>Article,</HI> which thus runs <HI>in
terminis,</HI> viz. <HI>Habet Ecclesia Ritus si∣ve
Ceremonias statuendi Ius, &amp; in Fi∣dei
Controversiis Authoritatem,</HI> &amp;c. But
the <HI>Regius Professor</HI> was as little pleased
with these Questions, and the <HI>Respon∣dents</HI>
stating of them, as he was with
the former: And therefore that he
might the more effectually expose him,
he openly declared how the <HI>Respondent</HI>
had falsified the publick Doctrine of
the Church, and charged the <HI>Article</HI>
with that Sentence, <HI>viz. Habet Eccle∣sia
Ritus sive Ceremonias,</HI> &amp;c. which
was not to be found in the whole Body
of it; and for the proof thereof, he
read the <HI>Article</HI> out of a Book which
lay before him beginning thus, <HI>Non
licet Ecclesiae quicquam instituere quod
verbo Dei scripto adversetur,</HI> &amp;c. To
which the <HI>Respondent</HI> rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y answer∣ed,
That he perceived by the bigness
of the Book which lay upon the Do∣ctors
<PB N="60" REF="44"/>
Cushion, that the <HI>Article</HI> he read
was out of the <HI>Harmony of Confessions</HI>
publish'd at <HI>Ceneva, Anno Dom.</HI> 1612.
which therein followed the Edition of
the <HI>Articles</HI> in the time of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 6.
<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1552. in which that Sen∣tence
was not found; but that it was
otherwise in the <HI>Articles</HI> agreed on in
the <HI>Convocation, Anno Dom.</HI> 1562. to
which most of us had subscribed in our
several places; but the <HI>Professor</HI> still
insisting upon that point, and the <HI>Re∣spondent</HI>
perceiving the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est part of
his Auditory dissatisfied, he called to
one Mr. <HI>Westly,</HI> who had formerly been
his Chamber-Fellow in <HI>Magdalen Col∣lege,</HI>
and desired him to fetch the Book
of <HI>Articles</HI> from some Adjacent Book∣sellers;
which being observed by the
<HI>Professor,</HI> he declared himself very wil∣ling
to decline any farther Debate a∣bout
that business, and to go on dire∣ctly
in the Disputation; But the <HI>Re∣spondent</HI>
was resolved to proceed no
further, <HI>Vsque dum liberaverit animam
suam ab istâ calumniâ,</HI> (as his own
<PB N="61" REF="44"/>
words were) till he had freed himself
from that Imputation. And it was not
long before the coming of the Book put
an end to the Controversie; out of
which he read the Article in <HI>English in
his▪ verbis, The Church hath power to de∣cree
Rites and Ceremonies, and Autho∣rity
in Controversies of Faith,</HI> &amp;c. which
done, he delivered the Book to one of
the Auditors who desired it of him, the
Book passing from one hand to another
till all were satisfied. And at this point
of time it was, that the Bishop of <HI>An∣golesme,</HI>
Lord <HI>Almoner</HI> to the Queen,
left the <HI>Schools,</HI> professing afterward,
<HI>That he could see no hope of a fair Dis∣putation
from so foul a beginning.</HI></P>
<P>It has been laid to Doctor <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s
charge, that at this time he was <HI>Hissed,</HI>
because he <HI>excluded King and Parlia∣ment
from being parts of the Church:</HI>
But he never deny'd either to be parts
of the <HI>Diffusive</HI> Body of the Church,
but only to be parts of the Church <HI>Re∣presentative,</HI>
which consists of the Bi∣shops
and Clergy in their several <HI>Coun∣cils.</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="45"/>
For neither King nor Parliament
are Members of the <HI>Convocation,</HI> as he
then proved and asserted. The <HI>Articles</HI>
ascribe to the Church of <HI>England</HI> Re∣presented
in a <HI>National Council</HI> power
of decreeing <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and
Authority of determining <HI>Controver∣sies</HI>
in Faith, as well as other Assem∣blies
of that nature. And this neither
deserved nor met with any <HI>Hiss.</HI> Per∣haps
a <HI>Hiss</HI> was then given, but it was
when the <HI>Regius Professor</HI> went to
prove, that not the <HI>Convocation,</HI> but
the <HI>High Court of Parliament</HI> had pow∣er
of ordering matters in the Church,
in making <HI>Canons,</HI> ordaining <HI>Ceremo∣nies,</HI>
and determining <HI>Controversies</HI> in
Religion. And he could find no other
<HI>medium</HI> to make it good, but the Au∣thority
of Sir <HI>Edw. Coke</HI> in one of the
Books of his <HI>Reports.</HI> An Argument
unto which the <HI>Respondent</HI> returned no
other <HI>Answer</HI> than <HI>Non credendum est
cuique extra suam Artem;</HI> upon which
immediately he gave place to the next
<HI>Opponent,</HI> which put an end to the
<PB N="63" REF="45"/>
heats of that Disputation. But it did
not so to the <HI>Regius Professors</HI> passion
against Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI> For conceiving his
Reputation somewhat lessened in the
eye of the world, he gave an account
in a paper of the whole transaction,
that tended very much to the Doctors
disgrace, as well as his own Justificati∣on.
But Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> well knew upon
what bottom he stood, and therefore in
his own Vindication caused the <HI>Profes∣sor</HI>
to be brought before the <HI>Council-Table</HI>
at <HI>Woodstock,</HI> where he was pub∣lickly
rebuked for the mis-representati∣ons
that he had made of him. And
upon the coming out of the Kings <HI>De∣claration</HI>
concerning Lawful Sports, Dr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI> took the pains to translate the
<HI>Regius Professors</HI> Lecture upon the
<HI>Sabbath</HI> into <HI>English,</HI> and putting a
Preface before it, caused it to be Prin∣ted;
A performance which did not on∣ly
justifie his Majesties proceedings,
but abated much of that opinion, which
Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> had amongst the Purita∣nical
Faction in those days.</P>

Pass we now from the University,
the School of Learning and Study, to

Dean of <HI>Worcester</HI>) presented to the
King a very learned Treatise, called
<HI>Charity Mistaken;</HI> and for a reward of
his great Abilities, had a <HI>Prebendship</HI>
of <HI>Windsor</HI> design'd for him, which
was then likely to become vacant by
the promotion of the Bishop of <HI>Gloce∣ster</HI>
to the See of <HI>Hereford.</HI> Many of
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s Friends were very zea∣lous
with the King on his behalf, es∣pecially
Dr. <HI>Neile</HI> then Archbishop of
<HI>York.</HI> But his Lordship stuck faster to
his Bishoprick, than he did to his Prin∣ciples,
and so the business ended. But
whilst it was in agitation, it occasioned
this merry <HI>Epigram</HI> from our young
<HI>Doctor,</HI> who was conceived by every
one to have missed that <HI>Prebendship</HI>
upon the supposed Vacancy;
<Q><PB N="65" REF="46"/>
<L><HI>When</HI> Windsor-<HI>Prebend late disposed
was,</HI></L>
<L>One ask'd me sadly how it came to pass,</L>
<L>Potter <HI>was chose and</HI> Heylyn <HI>was for∣saken?</HI></L>
<L><HI>I answered, 'twas</HI> Charity Mistaken.</L></Q>
But the Doctors Juvenile humor was
presently converted iuto a far less plea∣sing
passion. For Mr. Attorney-Gene∣ral
<HI>Noye</HI> left this world for a better,
very much to the sorrow, but much
more to the loss of Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI> He
kept his <HI>Whitsontide</HI> in 1634. with the
Doctor at <HI>Brentford,</HI> where he used
all imaginable arguments and intrea∣ties
to dissuade him from going to
<HI>Tunbridge</HI>-Waters the following <HI>Vaca∣tion,</HI>
importuning him to accompany
him to <HI>Alresford,</HI> where he would be
certain to find a better Air, and a more
careful Attendance. But we are very
often wise to our own hurt, and stand
in that light which would guide us to
safety and felicity. But whatsoever
<PB N="66" REF="47"/>
damage our Doctor sustained by the
loss of so invaluable a Friend, some
persons else have gained well by it, ha∣ving
two large Manuscripts of Mr.
<HI>Noys</HI> own hand-writing: The one con∣tains
the Collections he made of the
Kings maintaining his <HI>Naval</HI> power
accroding to the practice of his Royal
Predecessors: The other about the Pri∣viledges
and Jurisdictions of Ecclesiasti∣cal
Courts. These two Books Doctor
<HI>Heylyn</HI> had a sight of from Mr. <HI>Noye</HI>
about two months before the death of
that learned man. And it would be a
generous act and highly conducive to
the honor of Mr. <HI>Noy</HI>'s memory, as well
as the Kings and Churches interest, if
such Treasures were communicated to
the benefit of all his Majesties Subjects,
which are now only useful to some sin∣gle
persons.</P>
<P>Neither was this all the trouble that
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> met with at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime. For
some enemies then living added to the
sorrow and disturbance that he had for
his departed Friend. The grievances
<PB N="67" REF="47"/>
which the Collegiate Church of <HI>West∣minster</HI>
suffered under the Government
of <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> then
<HI>Commendatory-Dean</HI> thereof, became so
intolerable, that our Doctor was con∣strained
for the common safety of that
Foundation, to draw up certain <HI>Articles</HI>
(no less than 36.) against his Lordship
by way of charge; which he commu∣nicated
to Dr. <HI>Thomas Wilson,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ga∣briel
Moore,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ludovicus Wem∣mys,</HI>
Prebendaries of the said Church,
who embarqu'd themselves in the same
bottom with him, and resolved to
make complaint by way of <HI>Petition;</HI>
which was drawn up and presented to
the King by all four together in the
<HI>Withdrawing-Chamber</HI> at <HI>Whitehal,
March</HI> 31. 1634. And a <HI>Commission</HI>
was issued out thereupon to the Arch∣bishops
of <HI>Centerbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> the Earl
of <HI>Manchester</HI> Lord Privy-Seal, Earl of
<HI>Portland</HI> Lord high Treasurer, the Lord
Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and
the two Secretaries of State, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir
<HI>Iohn Coke</HI> and Sir <HI>Francis Windebank;</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="48"/>
authorizing them to hold a <HI>Visitation</HI>
of the Church of <HI>Westminster</HI> to exa∣mine
particular charges made against
<HI>Iohn</HI> Lord Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and to
redress such Grievances and Pressures
as the <HI>Prebendaries</HI> of the said Church
suffered by his Mis-government. The
Articles were returned to Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>
to be put in <HI>Latine,</HI> and the <HI>Commission</HI>
bore date <HI>April</HI> 20. But the whole
thing lay dormant till <HI>December</HI> 1635.
at which time the Bishop began again
to rage in his Province of <HI>Westminster,</HI>
dispossessing the <HI>Prebendaries</HI> of their
Seats, neglecting to call the <HI>Chapter</HI> to
pass accounts, conferring <HI>Orders</HI> in the
said Church within the space of a
month, permitting a Benefice in the
gift of the said Church, and lying
within his Diocess, to be lapsed unto
himself; with many other Grievances
which caused the forementioned <HI>Pre∣bendaries</HI>
to present a second <HI>Petition</HI>
to his Majesty, <HI>Humbly beseeching him
to take the ruinous and desperate estate
of the said Church into his Princely con∣sideration,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="48"/>
as 'tis worded in the <HI>Peti∣tion</HI>
it self.</P>
<P>Upon which the former <HI>Commission</HI>
was revived and delivered to the Lords
whom it did concern; and a Citation
fixed upon the Church-doors of <HI>West∣minster</HI>
accordingly. Upon <HI>Ianuary</HI> 25.
they were warned by the <HI>Sub-Dean</HI> to
meet the Bishop in <HI>Ierusalem-Chamber,</HI>
where amongst other matters his Lord∣ship
desired to know what those things
were that were amiss, that so he might
presently redress them. To whom Dr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI> replied, That seeing they had
put the business into his Majesties
hands, it would ill become them to
take it out of his into their own▪ <HI>Ian.</HI>
27. both parties met before the Lords
in the <HI>Inner Star-Chamber,</HI> where the
<HI>Commission</HI> was tendred and accepted,
and the whole business put into a me∣thodical
course; each following <HI>Mon∣day</HI>
being appointed for the day of
hearing, till the whole was concluded.
<HI>Feb.</HI> 1. The <HI>Commissioners</HI> with the
<HI>Plaintiffs</HI> and <HI>Defendant</HI> met in the
<PB N="70" REF="49"/>
<HI>Council-Chamber</HI> at <HI>Whitehal,</HI> where it
was ordered that the <HI>Plaintiffs</HI> should
be called by the name of <HI>Prebendaries-Supplicant.</HI>
That they should be admit∣ted
upon Oath as Witnesses. That they
should have a sight of all Registers,
Records, Books of Accounts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That
the first business that they should pro∣ceed
in should be that of the <HI>Seat,</HI> be∣cause
that made the breach or diffe∣rence
more visible and offensive to the
world, than those matters that were
more private and domestick, and fi∣nally
that the <HI>Prebendaries-Supplicant</HI>
should have an <HI>Advocate,</HI> who should
plead their Cause, defend their Rights,
and represent their Grievances. And
the person that they unanimously
made choice of was Dr. <HI>Peter Heylyn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 8. the <HI>Dean</HI> put in his Plea a∣bout
the <HI>Seat</HI> or great Pew under <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
the II. and the <HI>Advocate</HI> being
appointed by the <HI>Prebendaries-Suppli∣cant</HI>
to speak in the defence of their
common Interest, in the <HI>Seat</HI> now con∣troverted,
and of which the Bishop of
<PB N="71" REF="49"/>
<HI>Lincoln</HI> had most disgracefully dispo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses∣sed
them, he made choice to represent
to the Lord <HI>Commissioners,</HI> 1. Their
<HI>Original</HI> Right. 2. Their <HI>Derivative</HI>
Right, and lastly their <HI>Possessory</HI> Right.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Original</HI> Right he proved from
the Charter of their Foundation, from
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> their Foundress, who
declared by Act of Parliament made
in the first year of her Reign, the <HI>Abbey</HI>
of St. <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>Westminster</HI> fell into her
hands, and that being seized thereof,
and of all the Lands thereunto belong∣ing,
she did by her <HI>Letters Patents</HI> erect
the said dissolved <HI>Abbey</HI> into a Colle∣giate
Church, consisting of a <HI>Dean</HI> and
twelve <HI>Prebendaries;</HI> and that the
said <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Prebendaries</HI> should be
both in <HI>re &amp; nomine unum corpus corpo∣ratum,
one only Body Politick; that they
should have a perpetual Succession, a
Common Seal; and that they should Call,
Plead and be Impleaded by the name of
the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate
Church of St.</HI> Peter <HI>in</HI> Westminster.—So
that by this Donation the <HI>Dean</HI> hath
<PB N="72" REF="50"/>
no propriety in the said Church (his
own <HI>Stall</HI> excepted) but is joynt-Owner
with the <HI>Prebendaries</HI> of the
<HI>Site</HI> and <HI>Soil.</HI> Nor did the Queen be∣stow
upon them the Church alone, but
bestowed it <HI>joyntly upon them, una cum
omnibus antiquis privilegiis, libertati∣bus,
ac liberis consuetudinibus; and those
to be enjoyned in as full a manner, as ever
tho Abbot and Convent did before enjoy
the same.</HI> By which it appears, that all
the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the
Church of <HI>Westminster</HI> is vested joyntly
in the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter,</HI> and not in
the <HI>Dean</HI> alone. For as the <HI>Dean</HI> and
<HI>Chapter</HI> are one <HI>Body,</HI> so they make
one <HI>Ordinary;</HI> and as one <HI>Ordinary,</HI>
have a common and joynt Power to
dispose of <HI>Seats.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Derivative</HI> Right, he proved
from their <HI>Original</HI> Right: For the
Queen giving the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Prebenda∣ries</HI>
with their Successors all Rights,
Possessions, Privileges and Immunities,
they need only to prove their Successi∣on
in the Church of St. <HI>Peter;</HI> and
<PB N="73" REF="50"/>
then whatever Right was in their Pre∣decessors
<HI>Original,</HI> must be on them
<HI>derived.</HI></P>
<P>As for their <HI>Possessory</HI> Right, he desi∣red
their Lordships pardon, if he should
fail in the proof of it. For the Book of
the <HI>Chapter-Acts</HI> was missing, which
was very necessary in order to it. And
although one offered to take his Oath,
that the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> never saw
it; yet the Oath was so desperate, that
either the person who offered to take
it had an hand in making away the
Book, or else that he durst swear what∣ever
the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> said or asser∣ted.
But being deprived of that Evi∣dence,
he proceeded to <HI>Testimony;</HI>
where he did not make use of such Wit∣nesses
as were summoned by the <HI>Dean,
viz. Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ege</HI>-Servants and Tenants, who
were obnoxious to him; but indiffe∣rent
men, that were no way Friends to
the <HI>Complainants,</HI> but only to the
Truth; some of them Bishops, some
Doctors in Divinity, all of them of
unquestion'd Credit, and such as spake
<PB N="74" REF="51"/>
upon certain and affirmative know∣ledge.</P>
<P>Finally, the <HI>Advocate</HI> (than whom
never any Orator or Lawyer did better
acquit himself) urged, that however
things were in time past, yet the Bi∣shop
by his <HI>Non-Claim</HI> had pre-judged
himself; and that the possession of the
<HI>Prebendaries</HI> since his Lordship became
<HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> was sufficient to
create a Right, though they had never
any right before. And this he made
good by particular Cases and Decisions
in the <HI>Civil, Canon,</HI> and <HI>Common</HI> Laws.</P>
<P>First, for the <HI>Civil</HI> Law it was deter∣mined
by the Laws of the <HI>twelve Ta∣bles,</HI>
That a continued and quiet pos∣session
which any man had gained in a
<HI>Personal</HI> Estate, for one year only, or
for two years together in matters <HI>Real,</HI>
which they call <HI>Immovable,</HI> should cre∣ate
a Right; (those times being thought
sufficient for any man to put in his
Claim.) And so it held in <HI>Rome</HI> many
hundred years, till that upon some in∣conveniences
which did thence arise, it
<PB N="74" REF="51"/>
pleased <HI>Iustinian</HI> to set out his <HI>Edict</HI>
(which is still extant in the 7th. Book
of his <HI>Code</HI>) and in that <HI>Edict</HI> to De∣cree,
That a possession of three years
in matters <HI>Personal</HI> should beget a
Right: and as for <HI>Real</HI> Estates, it was
determined that a possession of ten years
<HI>inter praesentes,</HI> and twenty years <HI>in∣ter
absentes</HI> should conclude as much.
And in almost all Nations Christened,
the same Law has continued to this ve∣ry
time. So that if this be applied to
my Lord of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> he is gone in <HI>Civil</HI>
Law: For being resident here continu∣ally
for fifteen years together, he never
made his Claim to the <HI>Seat</HI> in questi∣on,
and so has lost his Right, if ever
he had any.</P>
<P>Next for the <HI>Canon</HI> Law, it yields as
many ruled Cases and Decisions, by
which to regulate this point as the for∣mer.
But the <HI>Advocate</HI> instanc'd only
in one. The Church of <HI>Sutry</HI> in <HI>Tusca∣ny</HI>
being void, the <HI>Canons</HI> go to the
Election of a Bishop, and make choice
of one whom they desire to have con∣firmed.
<PB N="76" REF="52"/>
The Clergy of the <HI>Convents</HI>
about the City interpose their Claim,
and make it manifest, <HI>Eos Electionibus
trium Episcoporum qui immediatè prae∣fuerunt,
&amp;c. interfuisse,</HI> i. e. that they
were present at the Election of the
three last Bishops, and did give their
Voices. The Pope thereupon deter∣mined,
that seeing the Witnesses on
the <HI>Canons</HI> part did seem to differ a∣mong
themselves, <HI>Et quod negativam
quodammodo astruere satagebant,</HI> and
that they went about to prove the Ne∣gative,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the said Clerks had no
Voices in the three last Elections, or
were not present in the same: (which
negative proof it seems was taken for
a strange attempt.) And seeing on the
other side, that it was manifest how
the said Clerks were present at the
three last Elections, and had their
Voices in the same, the former Ele∣ction
was made void, and the said
Clerks put into that possession which
they had before. A Case (says Dr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI>) that is very parallel to our
<PB N="77" REF="52"/>
present business, we claiming, that
if not before, yet in the time of the
three last <HI>Deans</HI> we had possession of
this <HI>Seat,</HI> and therefore are to be re∣stored
unto that possession, out of
which we had been cast by my Lord
of <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, for the <HI>Common</HI> Law, how∣ever,
there is nothing against which the
Laws do provide more carefully, than
the preventing or removing of a Force;
nor any thing wherein they do proceed
with more severity than in punishing
of the same; yet by the Laws it is en∣acted,
that they which keep their pos∣sessions
by Force in any Lands or Te∣nements
whereof they or their Ance∣stors,
or they, whose Estate they have
in such Lands or Tenements, have con∣tinued
their Possession by the space of
three years or more, be not endangered
by any former Statutes against Force,
Forcible Entries, and Forcible Detain∣ers.
So careful are the Laws to pre∣serve
Possession, that in most cases they
do prefer it before Right; at least till
<PB N="78" REF="53"/>
Right be cleared and Judgment be pro∣nounced
in favour of it. And albeit in
the <HI>Common</HI> Laws there is no ruled
Case in the present business, as being
meerly of Ecclesiastical Cognizance and
Jurisdiction, yet in the <HI>Common</HI> Law,
there is one Case which comes very
near it; and 'tis briefly this. If there
be two <HI>Ioynt-</HI>Tenants, or Tenants in
<HI>Common</HI> of certain Lands, and one of
them doth expel or put forth the other
out of Possession of the said Lands by
force, he that is so expelled may either
bring his Writ of Assize of <HI>Novel Dis∣seisin,</HI>
and so recover treble dammages,
or have his Action of Trespass of For∣cible
Entry against his Companion
that did so expel him, and thereupon
shall have a Writ of Restitution. This
Case is very near ours, as before is
said, the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Prebendaries</HI> being
<HI>Ioint-</HI>Tenants, or Tenants in <HI>Common</HI>
of the <HI>Seat</HI> in question, out of which
we are expelled forcibly by my Lord
of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and now desire the benefit
of the Law for our Restitution.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="53"/>
But (says the <HI>Advocate</HI>) my Lord ob∣jects,
that the <HI>Prebendaries</HI> are in sub∣jection
to him, that they swear <HI>Cano∣nical</HI>
Obedience to him, and therefore
should not sit in the same <HI>Seat</HI> with him.
But to both we answer with an <HI>Absque hoc,</HI>
we are not in subjection to him;
for we are made <HI>Ioynt-</HI>Governors with
him in every thing pertaining to the
Church, and in the Statutes are enti∣tuled
<HI>Primarii &amp; principes viri,</HI> and
are to be Assistants to him, and Asso∣ciates
with him in the common Go∣vernment
of the same. Nor do we
swear <HI>Canonical</HI> Obedience to him, as
is pretended. We only make <HI>Oath</HI> that
we shall give him <HI>dignam debitamque
Reverentiam,</HI> and that we swear to
give to all Officers: So that if <HI>Digna
Reverentia</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be construed <HI>Canonical</HI>
Obedience, we owe <HI>Canonical</HI> Obedi∣ence
to the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> the <HI>Treasurer,</HI>
the <HI>Sub-Dean</HI> and <HI>Steward,</HI> as well as
to the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln.</HI></P>
<P>Much more was spoken by Dr. <HI>Hey∣lyn
vivâ voce</HI> in this matter, which will
<PB N="80" REF="54"/>
be too tedious to be inserted in his <HI>Life.</HI>
But when he had ended his Speech, the
Lord <HI>Commissioners</HI> expected that the
Bishop would have made a Reply:
but after a long pause, he said no other
words than these, <HI>If your Lordships will
hear that young fellow prate, he will pre∣sently
persuade you that I am no Dean of</HI>
Westminster. But upon hearing the
proofs of both sides, it was ordered by
general consent of the Lord <HI>Commissi∣oners,</HI>
that the <HI>Prebendaries</HI> should be
restored to their old <HI>Seat,</HI> and that
none should sit there with them but
Lords of the Parliament and Earls El∣dest
Sons, according to the antient cu∣stom.
After this, there was no Bishop
of <HI>Lincoln</HI> to be seen at Morning-Pray∣er
in the Church, and seldom at Even∣ing.
<HI>Feb.</HI> 15. the Lord <HI>Commissioners</HI>
went on in hearing the particulars of
the second <HI>Petition,</HI> and so they pro∣ceeded
from one <HI>Monday</HI> to another, till
<HI>Monday April</HI> 4. and then adjourned
till the 25th. of the same month: up∣on
which day the business was again
<PB N="81" REF="54"/>
re-sumed, and the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI>
appeared not so well to the Lord <HI>Com∣missioners;</HI>
except those of the Laity,
who were apparently inclined to favour
him; and therefore those of the Clergy
thought it neither fit nor safe to pro∣ceed
to Sentence; and upon that the
<HI>Commission</HI> was put off <HI>sine die.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Advocate</HI>'s Activity in this Af∣fair
procured him a great deal of enmi∣ty
and ill-will both in Court and Coun∣trey,
as every mans Zeal will do, that
will be true to his Principles, and faith∣ful
in his Station. For whoever does
impartially administer, or peremptorily
demand publick Justice, will as cer∣tainly
be exclaimed of, as a Patient
will cry out of that Chirurgeon that
Launces a gangren'd or fester'd Wound.
But Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> gained these two ad∣vantages
by his zeal in this business,
<HI>viz.</HI> That he justified the Priviledges of
the <HI>Prebendaries,</HI> out of whose Reve∣nues
the Bishop kept a plentiful Ta∣ble;
inviting to it the chiefest of the
Nobility, Clergy and Gentry; the
<PB N="82" REF="55"/>
<HI>Prebendaries</HI> having no other advan∣tages
by his Hospitality, than to fill
their bellies with the first Course, and
then after the manner of great mens
Chaplains, to rise up and wait till the
coming in of the second: And the o∣ther
was, that by his frequent and <HI>ex∣tempore</HI>
Debates before the Lords <HI>Com∣missioners,</HI>
he was at last brought to
such an habit of speaking, that Preach∣ing
became more easie and familiar to
him, than it had been in the first part
of his life.</P>
<P>I will not (as I before promised) men∣tion
all the Grievances that were com∣plained
of concerning that great per∣son.
One thing more it may not be a∣miss
to insert in these Papers, and that
is Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s Refusal to sit in the
<HI>Choire</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> according to
Academical Decrees. For the Bishop of
<HI>Lincoln</HI> having taken a Resolution, that
the twelve <HI>Prebendaries</HI> should sit in
the <HI>Choire</HI> according to their Degrees in
the Vniversity, our Doctor remonstra∣ted
against it, giving these Reasons for
his Refusal.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="55"/>
1. In the <HI>Charter</HI> of the Foundati∣on
of that Church, the <HI>Prebendaries</HI>
are distinguished by <HI>Primus, Secundus,
Tertius, &amp;c.</HI> as now by <HI>Prima, Secunda,
Tertia Praebenda, &amp;c.</HI> according unto
which account, both in the <HI>Treasurers</HI>
Book, and in the <HI>Chanters,</HI> I am reckon∣ed
as the sixth <HI>Prebendary,</HI> and do
preach accordingly, as Successor to <HI>Ed∣mund
Schambler,</HI> the <HI>Sextus Prebenda∣rius</HI>
here first established.</P>
<P>2. In the same <HI>Charter</HI> of the Foun∣dation,
<HI>William Young</HI> being of no De∣gree
is placed before <HI>Gabriel Coodman,</HI>
Master of Arts, which makes it evi∣dent,
there was no purpose that for
the after-times, the Order of Acade∣mical
Degrees should be observed in
marshalling the <HI>Prebendaries</HI> places.</P>
<P>3. The Statutes of the <HI>College</HI> give
to the new succeeding <HI>Prebendaries</HI>
the <HI>Stall</HI> and <HI>House</HI> belonging to their
Predecessors in the same <HI>Prebend,</HI> ac∣cording
to these words thereof, <HI>Succe∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt
Prebendarii praedecessoribus suis in
eâdem praebenda tam in Stallo, loco &amp;
<PB N="84" REF="56"/>
voce in Capitulo, quam in domo eidem
Praebendae annexis.</HI> By which it is appa∣rent,
that the <HI>Stalls</HI> as well as <HI>Houses</HI>
are annexed to the <HI>Prebendaries.</HI> But
the <HI>Prebendaries</HI> by this Statute take
not their places in the <HI>Chapter-House</HI>
by any such Seniority as is pretended;
nor have two several <HI>Chapter-Acts</HI> been
found of any force to sever the <HI>Houses</HI>
from the <HI>Prebendaries,</HI> and therefore
not their <HI>Stalls</HI> neither.</P>
<P>4. His Majesties <HI>Letters Patents,</HI>
whereby I claim whatsoever I hold in
<HI>Westminster,</HI> give me <HI>Praebendam illam
quae vacat per mortem,</HI> G. Darrel (which
was the sixth <HI>Prebend) cum omnibus ju∣ribus
&amp; praeheminenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> with all Rights
and Pre-eminences thereunto belong∣ing;
and so by consequence the sixth
<HI>Stall</HI> also, as the pre-eminenee apper∣taining
to it.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>Mandat</HI> in those Letters Pa∣tents
is, that I be installed fully and
absolutely in the same <HI>Prebend</HI> which
was then vacant (<HI>In eandem Praeben∣dam
plenariè installari faciatis,</HI> as the
<PB N="85" REF="56"/>
Patent goes) which is not done at all,
either <HI>plenariè</HI> or <HI>in eandem,</HI> if this or∣der
hold.</P>
<P>6. The <HI>Mandat</HI> issuing out with
the said Letters Patents, is, that I be
Installed <HI>prout moris est,</HI> according to
the antient custom. But such a custom
by sitting according to degrees of
Schools was never yet known in <HI>West∣minster,</HI>
nor in any Church out of the
University that I can hear of, and is
not kept in many Colleges of the Uni∣versity,
which I am sure of: therefore
that clause reflects upon such a custom
as hath formerly been used in <HI>West∣minster,</HI>
and hath both the <HI>Statute</HI>
and the <HI>Charter</HI> for the ground there∣of.</P>
<P>7. Your Lordship did determin the
last <HI>Chapter,</HI> that the way of sitting by
<HI>Prima, Secunda, Tertia Praebenda, &amp;c.</HI>
was most agreeable to Statute; and
that if any man should take his place
accordingly, he could not be hindred
from so doing; to which determinati∣on
there was then a full assent in <HI>Cha∣pter,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="57"/>
and divers of the <HI>Prebendaries</HI>
have since sate accordingly.</P>
<P>8. Whereas your Lordship took a
Corporal Oath at your Admission into
this <HI>Deanery</HI> to govern this Collegiate
Church <HI>ex his Statutis,</HI> according to
the tenor of these very Statutes which
are now in use; and that the <HI>Preben∣daries</HI>
have all of them taken a several
Oath faithfully to observe the same Sta∣tutes;
and whereas the Statute is most
plain, that the new <HI>Prebendaries</HI> are
to have the <HI>Stalls</HI> of their Predecessors
in the same <HI>Prebend,</HI> I cannot see how
prossibly this new order can stand with
the same Statute, and so by consequence
with out Oaths, who have sworn to
keep them.</P>
<P>9. Upon this new order there will
follow such confusion in the Church,
that upon the coming in of a new <HI>Pre∣bendary,</HI>
the greatest part of the com∣pany
will be still troubled to remove
their <HI>Stalls</HI> higher or lower from one
side to another, according as the New-comer
is in Seniority; and so instead
<PB N="87" REF="57"/>
of order, we shall bring disorder into
our Church.</P>
<P>10. This new order is an Innovation
never before known in this Church, and
hath no ground in Statute or in Cu∣stom,
which, as your Lordship noted,
is <HI>optimus Insterpres Legis;</HI> but is quite
contrary thereunto. Unto which Sta∣tute
and his Majesties <HI>Letters Patents</HI>
I refer my self; humbly desiring that
these just reasons of my refusal to yield
to such an order, as neithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stands with
Statute, or with Custom, nor any other
true ground of Reason, may find a fa∣vourable
Interpretation and Admission.</P>
<P>Whilst these hot contests continued,
out came our Doctors <HI>History of the
Sabbath;</HI> the <HI>Argumentative</HI> or <HI>Scho∣lastick</HI>
part of which subject was refer'd
to Bishop <HI>White</HI> of <HI>Ely;</HI> the <HI>Historical</HI>
part to Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> who had before that
time given ample Testimony of his
knowledge in the antient Writers. The
<HI>History</HI> is divided into two parts: The
first whereof begins with the Founda∣tion
of the World, and carries on the
<PB N="88" REF="58"/>
story till the destruction of the Temple
at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> The second begins with
our Saviour Christ and his Apostles,
and is drawn down to the year 1633.
It was Written, Printed and Presented
to the King (by whose Special Com∣mand
he undertook it) in a less space
of time than four months, and had a
second Edition within three months af∣ter:
and notwithstanding the polemi∣cal
Debates upon that Argument, there
was never any one yet that had the
courage to return an Answer to that
<HI>History.</HI> And whoever peruses it with
serious and unprejudiced thoughts, will
find that its Author principally de∣signed
to withdraw his Country-men
from a <HI>Iudaical</HI> Observation of the
Lords day, <HI>i. e.</HI> from Dedica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the
whole of that time to the services and
offices of Religion; and refusing to
engage in any business, which our own
or our Neighbors Conveniences or
Necessities might exact from us. And
when all that our voluminous Writers
have said upon this Argument is
<PB N="89" REF="58"/>
summ'd up together, there are none of
them but will subscribe to the truth of
these two Propositions: 1. That
worldly cares and bodily Recreations
tend very much to discompose and ra∣rifie
men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spirits, and to fill them full
of froth and worldliness, of gaiety and
wantonness; so that they cannot fix
their thoughts upon Christian Duties
with any serious or continued Attenti∣on.
2. That 'tis impossible for the
minds of the generality of Christians,
who are not used to Contemplation to
be for a whole Lords day, or the great∣est
part of it, intent upon Religious
Exercises. And besides, if all Refresh∣ments
and Recreations were absolutely
unlawful upon that day. poor Servants
and the laborious part of mankind
would be highly prejudiced, for whose
benefit the Sabbath was first instituted
and appointed.</P>
<P>No sooner had the Doctor perfected
this <HI>History,</HI> but the Dean of <HI>Peterbo∣rough</HI>
engages him to answer the Bishop
of <HI>Lincloln</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Vicar</HI> of
<PB N="90" REF="59"/>
<HI>Grantham.</HI> He received it upon <HI>Good-Friday,</HI>
and by <HI>Thursday</HI> night follow∣ing
discovered the Sophistry, Mistakes
and Falshoods of it; and yet did not
for all that intermit any of the publick
Religious Exercises of the holy Feast
of <HI>Easter.</HI> It was approved by the
King; by him given to the Bishop of
<HI>London</HI> to be Licensed and Published
under the Title of <HI>A Coal from the Al∣tar.</HI>—In
less time then a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> twelve-month
the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> writ an
Answer to it, entituled, <HI>The Holy Ta∣ble,
Name and Thing:</HI> but pretended it
was writ long before by a Minister in
<HI>Lincolnshire</HI> against Dr. <HI>Cole,</HI> a Divine
in the days of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> Our Re∣verend
Doctor received a Massage from
his Majesty to return a Reply to it, and
not in the least to spare the Author,
<HI>April</HI> 1. 1637. And he obeyed the
Royal Command, in the space of se∣ven
weeks, presenting it ready Printed
to the King the 20th. of <HI>May</HI> following,
and called it <HI>Antidotum Lincolniense.</HI>
And although the Bishops Book was
<PB N="91" REF="59"/>
(from the dissatisfaction of the times,
the subject-matter of the Book it self,
and the Religious esteem of the Au∣thor
who was held in high Veneration)
looked upon to be unanswerable, and
sold for no less than 4 <HI>s.</HI> yet upon the
coming out of the answer, it was
brought to less than one. But before
this, he answered <HI>Burtons</HI> Seditious
Sermon, being thereunto also appointed
by the King; which Book although he
dispatch'd in a fortnight, yet it was
not published till <HI>Iune</HI> 26. 1637. being
kept in readiness till the Execution of
the <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> Sentence
upon the <HI>Triumviri;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pryn, Burto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Bastwick.</NOTE> that
so people might be satisfied
as well in the greatness of the Crimes,
as the necessity and justice of the pu∣nishment
inflicted upon those Offen∣ders.</P>
<P>In <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1637. the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI>
was Censured in the <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> for
tampering with Witnesses in the Kings
Cause, being suspended <HI>à Beneficio &amp;
Officio,</HI> and sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> where he
<PB N="92" REF="60"/>
continued three years, and did not in
all that space of time hear either Ser∣mon
or Publick Prayers. Not long af∣ter
this, Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> was chosen <HI>Trea∣surer</HI>
for the Church of <HI>Westminster,</HI>
and continued in that Office all the
while of the Bishops Imprisonment and
Suspension. And he made use of the
power with which that place invested
him to the best advantage of that
Foundation. For first he regu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated the
Disorders of the <HI>Iury</HI> by exacting the
<HI>Sconces</HI> or <HI>Perdition-money,</HI> and divi∣ding
it amongst those that were most
diligent and devout. Then he proceed∣ed
to repair the Timber-work of the
great <HI>West Isle,</HI> which was ready to
fall down; caused the new Arch over
the Preaching-place to be new Valuted,
and the Roof thereof to be raised to
the same heighth with the rest of the
Church; the Charge whereof amoun∣ted
to 434 <HI>l. 18 s. 10 d.</HI> and lastly,
made the <HI>South-side</HI> of the lower <HI>West-Isle</HI>
to be new Timbred, Boarded and
Leaded, being fallen into great decay.
<PB N="93" REF="60"/>
Thrice he assisted in the Election at
<HI>Westminster-School,</HI> and every time had
an opportunity of bringing in a Scho∣lar
into that Royal Foundation; for
two of which he was never spoke un∣to:
and for his kindness unto all three
he never had the value of one pint of
Wine, nor any thing of less moment.</P>
<P>Whilst he continued <HI>Treasurer,</HI> the
Parsonage of <HI>Islip</HI> became vacant by
the Death of Dr. <HI>King,</HI> unto which he
was presented by the <HI>Chapter.</HI> But he
deferr'd receiving <HI>Institution</HI> by reason
of its great distance from <HI>Alresford,</HI> be∣ing
advised to exchange it for some o∣ther
that was more near and conveni∣ent.
After many offers, he at last ex∣changed
with Mr. <HI>Atkinson</HI> of <HI>St. Iohns
College</HI> in <HI>Oxon</HI> for <HI>South-Warnborough,</HI>
which was eight miles distant from his
other Living; and the perpetual Pa∣tronage
of which Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> had
bestowed upon that fore-mentioned
Society. But that Gentleman enjoyed
<HI>Islip</HI> but a few weeks; and those of
his <HI>College</HI> conceiving themselves pre∣judiced
<PB N="94" REF="61"/>
by the change, our Doctor was
so generous, as to obtain for one of the
Fellows a second <HI>Presentation</HI> to <HI>Islip,</HI>
for which he never received so much as
the least civil Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>But he had other things to afflict his
spirit at that time, his whole Family
being visited with a contagious Fever,
and no person in it, except one Servant,
but were all sick at one and the same
time. The Doctor did as narrowly e∣scape
death, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his Compa∣nions
did Shipwrack, when they went
to <HI>Rome.</HI> The Fever had so seized up∣on
his spirits, that after the abatement
of its Paroxisms, he had many dull and
sleepless nights: and returning upon
him with greater violence a twelve-month
after, he was reduced to so ex∣treme
a weakness, that all his Friends
together with himself supposed him
fallen into a deep Consumption. And
yet even at this time his mind was not
idle or unactive. For now it was that
he first meditated of a project of Wri∣ting
a <HI>History</HI> of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="61"/>
since the <HI>Reformation.</HI> And no
sooner had he recovered some measure
and degrees of strength, but he pre∣pared
materials for it; and upon his
return to <HI>London,</HI> obtained the freedom
of Sir <HI>Robert Cotton</HI>'s Library, and by
the recommendation of Archbishop
<HI>Laud</HI> had liberty granted him to carry
home some of the Books, leaving 200 <HI>l.</HI>
apiece as a pawn behind him.</P>
<P>About this time it was, that the
Commotions began to be hot in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and the Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI>
designing to put out an <HI>Apology</HI>
for vindicating the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> that he
had recommended to that <HI>Kirk,</HI> desi∣red
our Doctor to translate it into <HI>La∣tine;</HI>
that being published with the
<HI>Apology,</HI> the world might be satisfied
in his Majesties Piety, as well as his
<HI>Graces</HI> care; as also that the rebellious
and perverse temper of the <HI>Scots</HI> might
be apparent unio all, who would raise
such tumults upon the recommendati∣on
of a Book that was so venerable
and Orthodox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Our Reverend Doctor
<PB N="96" REF="62"/>
undertook and compleated it; but the
distemper and troubles of those times
were the occasion that the Book went
no farther than the hands of that lear∣ned
<HI>Martyr.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Feb.</HI> 1639. Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> was put in
<HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> for the County
of <HI>Hampshire;</HI> into which he was no
sooner admitted, but he occasioned the
discovery of an horrid Murther, that
had been committed many years be∣fore
in that Country. <HI>April</HI> following
he was elected Clerk of the <HI>Convocati∣on</HI>
for the College of <HI>Westminster.</HI> At
which time the Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI>
sending a <HI>Canon</HI> to that Assembly
for <HI>the Suppressing the further growth
of Popery, and bringing Papists to Church,</HI>
our Reverend Doctor moved his <HI>Grace</HI>
that the <HI>Canon</HI> might be enlarged for
the greater satisfaction of the people,
as well as the protection of the Church,
<HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That all persons entrusted with
Care of Souls, should respectively use
all possible Care and Diligence by
open Conferences with the Parties,
<PB N="97" REF="62"/>
and by Censures of the Church in in∣ferior
Courts, as also by Complaints
unto the Secular Powers, to reduce
all such to the Church of <HI>England</HI> as
were misled into Popish Superstition.</Q>
This and much more was offered by
Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> as may be seen
more at large in his Life of
the Archbishop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 426.</NOTE> And a∣bout
the same time he drew up a Pa∣per
wherein he offered a mutual Con∣ference
by select <HI>Committees</HI> between
the House of <HI>Commons</HI> and the Lower
House of <HI>Convocation:</HI> And this he did
that the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the Cler∣gy
might give satisfaction to the <HI>Com∣mons</HI>
in point of <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and in
other matters relating to the Church,
if the motion was accepted; but if re∣fused,
that they might gain the advan∣tage
of Reputation among knowing
and wise persons. But the unhappy Dis∣solution
of the Parliament prevented
all things of this nature: The news of
which was so unwelcome and amazing
to Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> that being then busied
<PB N="98" REF="63"/>
at the Election for the School at <HI>Westminster,</HI>
the Pen fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of his hand;
and it was not without some difficulty
before he could recollect his thoughts
in the business about which he was en∣gaged.</P>
<P>The <HI>Convocation,</HI> according to usual
custom, had expired the next day after
the Parliament, had not our Reverend
man gone to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and there dis∣played
to the Archbishop the Kings ne∣cessities,
and acquainted him with a
precedent in the Reign of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI>
for granting <HI>Subsidies</HI> or a <HI>Be∣nevolence</HI>
by <HI>Convocation</HI> to be taxed
and levied without help of Parliament.
Upon which proposal the <HI>Convocation</HI>
was adjourned till <HI>Wednesday, May</HI> 13.
on which day the Bishops met in full
<HI>Convocation,</HI> and a <HI>Commission</HI> was sent
down to the <HI>Lower-House,</HI> dated <HI>May</HI>
12, which <HI>enabled the Prelates and
Clergy then Assembled to treat of, and
conclude upon such Canons as they con∣ceived
necessary for the good of the
Church.</HI> The greatest part of the Clergy
<PB N="99" REF="63"/>
very much scrupled this matter, con∣ceiving
the <HI>Convocation</HI> to end with the
Parliament. But our Reverend <HI>Divine</HI>
being well skill'd in the Records of
<HI>Convocations,</HI> shew'd the distinction between the
<HI>Writ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbishops Life, <HI>page</HI> 429.</NOTE> for calling a Parlia∣ment,
and that for assembling a <HI>Convo∣cation;</HI>
their different <HI>Forms,</HI> the in∣dependence
of one upon the other, as
also between the <HI>Writ,</HI> by which they
were called to be a <HI>Convocation,</HI> to
make <HI>Canons</HI> and do other business. He
proved also, that although the <HI>Commis∣sion</HI>
was expired with the Parliament,
yet the <HI>Writ</HI> continued still in force;
by which they were to remain a <HI>Convo∣cation</HI>
till they were Dissolved by ano∣ther
<HI>Writ.</HI> With this distinction he sa∣tisfied
the greatest part of those who
scrupled to sit after the Parliaments
Dissolution. But the King proved the
best <HI>Casuist</HI> in the case; who being ac∣quainted
with these scrupulosities, cal∣led
the most learned in the Laws to
consult about them; by whom it was
<PB N="100" REF="64"/>
determined, <HI>That the Convocation be∣ing
called by the Kings Writ, notwith∣standing
the Dissolution of the Parlia∣ment,
was to be continued till it was Dis∣solved
by the Kings Writ,</HI> And this was
subscribed by <HI>Finch,</HI> Lord Keeper, <HI>Lit∣tleton</HI>
Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Com∣mon-Pleas,
Banks,</HI> Attorney-General,
<HI>Whitfield,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It will be too tedious to insert into
these Papers all the Debates that were
in this learned Assembly; most of them
are to be seen in the Life
of the Archbishop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 430.</NOTE> Suf∣fice
it to acquaint the
Leader, that few or none of those pro∣positions
which either concerned the
Institution, Power, or Priviledges of So∣vereign
Kings, or related to the Episco∣pal
Power, Doctrine, or Discipline of
the <HI>English</HI> Church, but were either
first proposed, or afterward drawn up
by Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> though he ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his
great modesty and worth ascribes them
to other persons. It was the Clerk of
the Church of <HI>Westminster,</HI> who was
<PB N="101" REF="64"/>
placed on purpose by the <HI>Prolocutor</HI>
to speak last in the Grand <HI>Committee</HI>
for the <HI>Canon</HI> of Uniformity, and to
answer all such Arguments as had been
brought against any of the Points pro∣posed,
and were not answered to his
hand. It was he who made a proposition
for one uniform Book of <HI>Articles</HI> to be
used by all Bishops and Arch-deacons in
Visitations, to avoid the confusion that
happened in most parts of the Church
for want of it; those <HI>Articles</HI> of the Bi∣shops
many times everting those of the
Arch-Deacons, one Bishop differing
from another, the Successors from the
Predecessors, and the same person not
consistent to those <HI>Articles</HI> which him∣self
had published; by means whereof
the people were much disturbed; the
Rules of the Church contemned for
their multiplicity; unknown by rea∣son
of their uncertainty, and despised
by reason of the inconstancy of those
that made them. The motion back'd
by these Reasons did so well please the
<HI>Prolocutor,</HI> with the rest of the Clergy,
<PB N="102" REF="65"/>
that they desired the Doctor in pursuit
of his own project to undertake the
Compiling of the said Book of <HI>Articles,</HI>
and to present it to the House with all
convenient speed. It was the same lear∣ned
man who took into consideration
the great Excesses and Abuses, which
were crept in, and complained of Ec∣clesiastical
Courts: the redress and Re∣formation
of which Grievances, was
brought within the compass of these
seven Heads. 1. Concerning <HI>Chancel∣lors
Patents, and how long their virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was to continue.</HI> 2. That <HI>Chancellors
were not alone to censure the Clergy in
sundry cases.</HI> 3. That <HI>Excommunicati∣on
and Absolution were not to be pro∣nounced
but by a Priest.</HI> 4. Concern∣ing
<HI>Commutations and the way of dispo∣sing
of them.</HI> 5. Concerning <HI>Concur∣rent
Iurisdictions.</HI> 6. Concerning <HI>Li∣cences
to Marry.</HI> 7. Against <HI>Vexatious
Citations.</HI> Some other things were
proposed and designed, but never put
in execution; there being intended an
<HI>English Pontifical,</HI> which was to con∣tain
<PB N="103" REF="65"/>
the <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of the Coro∣nation
of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and to serve
as a standing Rule to succeeding Ages
on the like occasions. Another Form to
be observed by all Archbishops and
Bishops for consecrating Churches,
Church-yards and Chappels. And a
third for reconciling such <HI>Penitents</HI> as
either had done open <HI>Pennance,</HI> or had
revolted from the Faith of Christ to
the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Which three, to∣gether
with the Form of <HI>Confirmation,</HI>
and that of ordering Bishops, Priests
and Deacons, (which were then in
force) were to make up the whole Bo∣dy
of the Book intended. But the trou∣bles
of the times increasing, it was
thought expedient to defer the prose∣cution
of it till a fitter conjuncture.
And yet notwithstanding all the storms
that were then rising, this excellent
person went through the Book of
<HI>Articles;</HI> the compiling of which gave
no obstruction to him from attending
the service of the <HI>Committee</HI> upon all
occasions. And for the better Authori∣zing
<PB N="104" REF="66"/>
of the <HI>Articles,</HI> he placed before
every one of them in the Margin, the
<HI>Canon, Rubrick, Law, Injunction,</HI> or o∣ther
<HI>Authentick</HI> Evidence upon which
they were grounded: Which being fi∣nished,
were by him openly read in the
House, and by the House approved
and passed without any alteration; on∣ly
that exegatical or explanatory clause
in the fourth <HI>Article</HI> of the fourth <HI>Cha∣pter</HI>
touching the reading of the <HI>Com∣munion-Service</HI>
at the Lords Table, was
desired by some to be omitted, which
was done accordingly. Finally, it was
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> who proposed a <HI>Canon</HI> <Q>for
enjoyning the said Book to be only
used in <HI>Parochial Visitations,</HI> for the
better settling of Uniformity in the
outward Government and Admini∣stration
of the Church, and for pre∣venting
of such just Grievances as
might be laid upon the Church-War∣dens
and other sworn men by any im∣pertinent,
inconvenient, or illegal <HI>En∣quiries</HI>
in the <HI>Articles</HI> for <HI>Ecclesiasti∣cal
Visitations.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="66"/>
Neither were these the only Fruits
of his labours and travels in this busi∣ness;
there being six Subsidies granted
to the King; and the Bishops and Cler∣gy
in <HI>Convocation</HI> upon the 20th. of
<HI>May</HI> received his Majesties Letters, Sea∣led
with his Royal <HI>Signet,</HI> and atte∣sted
by his <HI>Sign</HI> Manual, which requi∣red
and authorized them to proceed in
making <HI>Synodical Constitutions</HI> for le∣vying
of those Subsidies which had
been before granted. And this was ea∣sily
done, there being nothing to be al∣tered
but the changing of the name of
<HI>Subsidy</HI> into that of <HI>Benevolence. Fri∣day,
May</HI> 29. the <HI>Canons</HI> were formally
subscribed unto by the Bishops and
Clergy, no one dissenting except the
Bishop of <HI>Glocester</HI> (who died in the
Communion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and
was all that part of his life in which he
revolted from the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
a dear Favourite and Servant of <HI>Oliver
Cromwel,</HI> unto whom he dedicated
some of his Books) for which he was
voted worthy of Suspension by the
<PB N="106" REF="67"/>
<HI>Convocation,</HI> and was accordingly Su∣spended
by the Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury.</HI>
Which being done, the <HI>Convoca∣tion</HI>
was dissolved.</P>
<P>Proceed we now from the <HI>Active</HI> to
the more <HI>Passive</HI> part of Dr. <HI>Heyly</HI>'s
life. For the Long Parliament, the
Churches as well as the Kings Scourge,
began to sit at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and a ge∣neral
Rumor was spread both in City
and Country, that our Doctor being
conscious to himself of many Crimes,
durst not stand the brunt of their dis∣pleasure,
and therefore had made use
of his heels as his best weapons of de∣fence;
being run away out of a fear
and foresight of an approaching storm.
When these rumors were raised, he was
at his Parsonage of <HI>Alresford,</HI> from
whence he hastened with all conveni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt
speed, confuting the Calumny, by
shewing himself the very next day after
his coming to <HI>London</HI> in his Gown and
Tippet in <HI>Westminster-Hall.</HI> And upon
a Vote passed in the House of Lords,
that no Bishop should be of the <HI>Com∣mittee</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="67"/>
for the Preparatory Examinati∣ons
in the Cause of the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford,</HI>
under colour that they were ex∣cluded
from acting in it by some anti∣ent
<HI>Canons,</HI> as in cause of Blood, our
learned <HI>Divine</HI> did thereupon draw up
a brief Discourse, entituled, <HI>De jure
Paritatis Episcoporum</HI> (now inserted in
the Re-printed Volume of his Works)
which he presented unto many of the
Bishops to assert all their Rights of
<HI>Peerage</HI> (and this of being of that <HI>Com∣mittee</HI>
among the rest) which either by
Law or antient custom did belong un∣to
them.</P>
<P>The Parliament began their <HI>Session
Novemb.</HI> 3. 1640. and upon the 9th.
of <HI>December</HI> following, upon the Com∣plaint
of Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI> our Doctor was
called before the <HI>Committee</HI> of the
Courts of Justice; who accosted him
with that fierce fury, that no one could
have withstood the Torrent, but one
whose Soul was fortified with Inno∣cence
equal to his Courage. The Crime
objected against him, was, that he had
<PB N="108" REF="68"/>
been a subservient Instrument under
the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> all the
sufferings of Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI> having read the
<HI>Histriomastix,</HI> out of which he had fur∣nished
the Lords of the <HI>Council</HI> and ma∣ny
other persons with matter to pro∣ceed
against its Author. But our Do∣ctor
made a bold and just Defence for
himself, telling his Accusers, That the
Task was imposed upon him by Royal
Authority, which he would readily
prove, if they would have so much pa∣tience
as to allow him time for that
purpose. Great hopes they had to
squeeze something out of him concern∣ing
his being engaged in it by the Arch∣bishop:
but he was too wary to be en∣snared
by any of their Artifices, and be∣ing
faithful to his Friend and Patron,
was kept four days under Examinati∣on,
suffering for the two first the bru∣tish
Rage of the People, more perhaps
than St. <HI>Paul</HI> did at <HI>Ephesus;</HI> for that
blessed man did not adventure himself
amongst those Savages. But our poor
Doctor was tossed up and down by the
<PB N="109" REF="68"/>
fury of an ungovern'd multitude, and
railed at as he passed through them
by their leud and ungoverned tongues.
But God who sets bounds to the Waves
of the proud Ocean, rebuked their
rage, and rescued him from their ma∣lice.</P>
<P>But alas! what civility can be expe∣cted
from the ill-bred Rabble unto
Clergy-men, when they themselves
like the Eagle in the <HI>Greek Apologue</HI>
wound one another with Arrows fea∣thered
with their own Plumes. For
four days after he had received order
to appear before the <HI>Committee,</HI> he
preach'd his turn in the <HI>Abbey</HI> at
<HI>Westminster,</HI> and in the midst of his
Sermon was insufferably affronted by
the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> who knocking
the Pulpit with his Staff, cried out a∣loud,
<HI>No more of that Point, No more of
that Point,</HI> Peter. This happened to
the poor man in very ill circumstances,
for it occasioned new clamours, and a∣nimated
his enemies to proceed on
with greater violence against him. But
<PB N="110" REF="69"/>
notwithstanding all their united ma∣lice,
he held out bravely, sending the
whole passage of his Sermon as he de∣signed
to Preach it both to his Friends
at <HI>Court,</HI> and Enemies in Parliament:
and taking Sir <HI>Robert Filmore,</HI> with
some other Gentlemen that were his
Auditors, out of the Church along
with him to his House, where he im∣mediately
sealed up his Sermon-Notes
in their presence, they setting their
Seals to them, that so there might not
be the least Alteration in the Sermon,
nor any ground to suspect it. Nay he
made choice of one Mr. <HI>White,</HI> the
fiercest man in the <HI>Committee,</HI> to be
judg of the affront offered to him, de∣siring
him in his Letter, <Q>That he
would recommend him to the House
of Commons, that they might so far
take him into their protection, as
might consist with the Honor and Ju∣stice
of their House; otherwise he
would rather chuse to put himself up∣on
their Censure for a Contempt in
not appearing, than be again exposed
<PB N="111" REF="69"/>
to the fury of an outragious people,
whose malice is most merciless be∣cause
most groundless: That after he
was dismissed from the <HI>Committee,</HI> he
was set upon by the rude and uncivil
Multitude with thrustings, justlings,
spurnings, and worse than that, with
such opprobrious and reviling lan∣guage,
that as he never endured the
like before, so he was confident it
would add much to the esteem and
reputation of that honorable House,
if neither he nor any other honest
man do endure it more. And lastly,
whereas he was intertupted in his
Sermon by the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and
thereupon might justly think that
there was some strange matter like
to follow, which might enforce him
to such an unusual course, therefore
he intreated him to accept of the
whole passage, as it should have been
spoken <HI>verbatim</HI> out of the original
Copy.</Q></P>
<P>And the whole passage I shall here
transcribe, as being that which may at
<PB N="112" REF="70"/>
least gratifie the curiosity, if not in∣form
the judgment of the Reader.
<Q>Such also should the correspondence
and affections be between the Mem∣bers
and particular Assemblies of the
Church Militant▪ all which, though
many and of different natures, make
but one Body in the whole; and
therefore to be so affected each to o∣ther
as the bodily members. Now
God hath so disposed the members in
the body natural, that they should
have the same care of one another;
and though they be of several quali∣ties,
yet do endeavour the subsistence
of the whole <HI>composition,</HI> that so there
may be no Schism nor dangerous divi∣sion
in the body of man. An excellent
<HI>Item</HI> unto us, to teach us our behaviour
to our Fellow-members in the Church
of Christ; that we aim all of us at
Gods glory, and the Churches peace,
raising no Schism, nor making any
Division in this blessed body. But
we alas! neglect this <HI>Item,</HI> and hear∣ken
not to those instructions of peace
<PB N="113" REF="70"/>
and unity which every member of
the Body doth even preach unto us.
Men of dull spirits in the Lord, who
will not give an ear to his word and
works, when now the very flesh is
become a preacher to them. How
comes it else to pass, that in the very
Church of Christ there be almost as
many Schisms as Nations; such dif∣ferences
not alone in points of Do∣ctrin,
but also in the Forms of our
Devotions? The Christian Church
divided into the <HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Western:</HI>
the <HI>Western</HI> into <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Prote∣stant:</HI>
the <HI>Protestant</HI> into the <HI>Luthe∣ran</HI>
and <HI>Zuinglian:</HI> the <HI>Zuinglian</HI> in∣to
<HI>Calvinist</HI> and <HI>Remonstant.</HI> Not to
say any thing of any other Sects, or
Subdivisions into the same Sects,
more dangerous though not so no∣table.
And how comes this to pass,
but that forgetting that we make to∣gether
one Body only, we would
have every member be a several Bo∣dy,
and thereby make our Saviour
Christ more monstrous than the Gi∣ant
<PB N="114" REF="71"/>
<HI>Gerion,</HI> and not to have three
Bodies only, but three hundred thou∣sand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That so it is, who knows not that
knows any thing? But why it should
be so we must ask our selves. Is it
not that we are so affected with our
own Opinions, that we condemn
whoever shall opine the contrary?
And so far wedded to our own wills,
that when we have espoused a Quar∣rel,
neither the Love of God, nor
the God of Love shall divorce us
from it? Instead of hearkening to the
voice of the Church, every man
hearkens to himself, and cares not if
the whole miscarry so that himself
may bravely carry out his own de∣vices.
Upon which stubborn height
of pride, what quarrels have been
rais'd! What Schisms in every cor∣ner
of this our Church! (to enquire
no further) some rather putting all
into open tumult, than that they
would conform to a lawful Govern∣ment
derived from Christ and his A∣postles
<PB N="115" REF="71"/>
to these very times.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">At these words the Bi∣shop knock'd with his Staff on the Pulpit.</NOTE> Others com∣bining
into close and
dangerous Factions, be∣cause
some points of
Speculative Divinity are otherwise
maintained than they would have
them. All so regardless of the com∣mon
peace, that rather than be quiet,
we will quarrel with our Blessed
Peace-maker for seeking to compose
the differences, though to the preju∣dice
of neither party. Thus do we
foolishly divide our Saviour, and rent
his Sacred Body on the least occasi∣on;
vainly conceiving that a diffe∣rence
in point of Judgment must
needs draw after it a dis-jointing of
the affection also, and that conclude
at last in an open Schism. Whereas
diversity of Opinions if wisely man∣naged,
would rather tend to the dis∣covery
of the Truth, than the distur∣bance
of the Church; and rather
whet our Industry than excite our
Passions. It was S. <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Resolu∣tion,
<PB N="116" REF="72"/>
<HI>Neminem, licet aliter senserit, à
communione amovere;</HI> not to suspend
any from the Churches Communi∣on;
although the matter then deba∣ted
was (as I take it) of more weight
than any of the points now contro∣verted.
Which moderation, if the
present age had attained unto, we
had not then so often torn the
Church in pieces, nor by our fre∣quent
broils offered that injury and
inhumanity to our Saviours Body,
which was not offered to his Gar∣ments
by those that Crucified him.</Q></P>
<P>These were the feuds that passed be∣tween
these two Clergy-men; and 'tis
worthy of remark, that although both
of them were at so wide a distance
in the prosperous condition of the
Church, yet there was a closure made
when the heavy storm fell upon it. For
a motion being offered by Dr. <HI>Newel,</HI>
but coming originally from the Bishop
of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> with the privi∣ty
and consent of the Archbishop paid
the respects of a Visit to his Lordship
<PB N="117" REF="72"/>
at his Lodging in <HI>Westminster,</HI> where
he met rather▪ with a ceremonious
than a kind Reception. A short Reca∣pitulation
there was made of some past
differences between them, and a pro∣posal
for atonement of all faults, <HI>viz.</HI>
the calling in of the <HI>Antidotum Lin∣colniense,</HI>
and that too by the Kings
command. Unto which our Doctor
answered, That it was Writ and Pub∣lished
by the Kings Command, and
therefore it was improbable that
he would call it in; however he would
try all possible ways to give his Lord∣ship
satisfaction; and then presented to
him his Papers about the <HI>Peerage of
Bishops,</HI> which he then read over and
approved. After this there was no
more meeting between them, till a∣bout
a year following the Doctor gave
his Lordship a Visit in the <HI>Tower,</HI>
which he received so kindly, that for
ever after a fair correspondence passed
interchangeably between them.</P>
<P>And the passage in the Sermon had
as kindly an effect upon the <HI>Committee,</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="73"/>
as his Visit had upon the Bishop. For he
found those fierce Gentlemen, after the
perusal of his Notes, much more fa∣vourable
and respective than before.
They demanded a Copy of the Charge
which he drew up against Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI>
which being delivered, Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI> accu∣sed
him of Libelling and Preaching a∣gainst
him; for proof of which he pro∣duced
in Court some of the Doctor's
Books, urging many passages out of
them; but all concluded nothing. That
which was at last most insisted on was
a Sermon Preach'd some years before
Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI>'s Censure in the <HI>Star-Chamber</HI>
before his Majesty. but the sense of
his past dangers before the <HI>Committee</HI>
was in some measure recompenc'd by
this days mirth and jollity. For Mr.
<HI>Pryn</HI> resolving effectually to damnifie
the Doctor, produced a company of
<HI>Butchers</HI> to bring in Evidence against
him about a Sermon formerly Preach'd
by him. And after the Testimony of
these great Criticks had been mannag'd
to the best advantage of Raillery and
<PB N="119" REF="73"/>
Mirth, the Criminal was favourably
dismissed and never more called before
them. 'Tis true, many attempts were
made to create him new Disturbances,
some being employed to make a severe
inquisition into his Life and Manners,
which they found too spotless for their
spleen and malice. Others engaged his
Neighbours at <HI>Alresford</HI> to draw up
<HI>Articles</HI> against him; which was ac∣cordingly
done by two of them, and
few others of the most inconsiderable
Inhabitants; who were prevailed on
to make their Marks (for Write they
could not) by telling them it was a bu∣siness,
in which the Town were very
much concerned. But when the <HI>Articles</HI>
were produced before the <HI>Committee,</HI>
they appeared so foolish and frivolous,
as not to be deemed worthy of consi∣deration,
and upon that were retur∣ned
to be amended upon a <HI>Melius In∣quirendum:</HI>
and this being done in a
more correct and enlarg'd Edition, they
were again return'd to the <HI>Committee,</HI>
and a set day was appointed for a
<PB N="120" REF="74"/>
Hearing: And that being come, the
Complaint was put off <HI>sine die,</HI> and a
Copy of the <HI>Articles</HI> delivered to the
person accused, together with those
newly put in against him by Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI>
collected out of his Printed Books. But
the poor Doctor being quite tir'd with
Business and Attendance, obtained
leave of the <HI>Chair-man</HI> to retire into
the Country, who freely promised to
send a private Messenger to him, if
there were any occasion for his return.
Upon which he removed his Study to
<HI>Alresford,</HI> setting his House for no
more than 3 <HI>l.</HI> a year, with a purpose
never more to come back to <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
whilst those two incomparable
Friends remained in it, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>House
of Commons,</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Lincoln.</HI>
At his coming to <HI>Alresford</HI> the people
were amazed to see him, having been
persuaded that they should never more
fix eye on him, unless they took a
journey to a Goal or a Gallows.</P>
<P>About this time it was that Doctor
<HI>Hacwel</HI> taking advantage of the innu∣merable
<PB N="121" REF="74"/>
troubles and enemies of this
learned man, publish'd a book against
him concerning the Sacrifice of the <HI>Eu∣charist.</HI>
It was not without some diffi∣culty
that he obtained one of them to
be sent to him in the Country, where he
wrote a speedy Answer to it. But Dr.
<HI>Hackwel</HI>'s Friends thought fit to call
in the Book, so soon as it first came in∣to
light, and then our Doctor was ea∣sily
persuaded to suppress his Answer,
diverting his Studies to more pleasing
and no less necessary subjects, <HI>viz.</HI> The
<HI>History of Episcopacy,</HI> and the <HI>History
of Liturgies.</HI> The first was Printed pre∣sently
after it was written, and Presen∣ted
to the King by Mr. Secretary <HI>Ni∣cholas,</HI>
and Published under the name
of <HI>Theophilus Churchman;</HI> but the o∣ther,
although sent to <HI>London,</HI> and re∣ceived
by the Bookseller, was not Prin∣ted
till some years after.</P>
<P>For now there was more employ∣ment
found out for the Sword than
the Pen, the noise of <HI>Bellona</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI>
silencing the Laws of God and Men;
<PB N="122" REF="75"/>
and Christians conceiving it their duty
rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to spill the Blood of their Coun∣try-men
for Religion, than to part with
one drop out of their own veins, and
to plunder the Goods of their Neigh∣bours
than to <HI>endure the spoiling</HI> of
their own. Sir <HI>Will. Waller</HI> sent eighty
of his Soldiers to be quartered at the
Doctors house, with full Commission
to strip him naked of all he had: But
his fair and affable carriage towards
them did so mollifie the Austerity of
their natures, that they quite dismis∣sed
all thoughts of violence and re∣venge:
So were <HI>Esau</HI>'s bloody resolu∣tions
quite converted into kindness and
respect by the humble deportment as
well as noble presents that were made
to him by his Brother <HI>Iacob.</HI> But not∣withstanding
the Diversion of this
storm, the Reverend man was early
the next morning brought before Sir
<HI>William</HI> by his <HI>Provost-Marshal;</HI> by
whom he was told that he had received
Commands from the Parliament to
seize upon him, and send him Prisoner
<PB N="123" REF="75"/>
unto <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> The Doctor had the
like privilege with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> being per∣mitted
to plead for himself, and by his
powerful reasoning did so far prevail
upon the <HI>General,</HI> as to be dismissed
back to his house in safety. But pru∣dently
fore-seeing that this would on∣ly
be a Reprieve till a further mischief,
within a few days he left <HI>Hampshire</HI> and
went to <HI>Oxon;</HI> where he no sooner ar∣rived,
but he received his Majesties
Commands by the <HI>Clerk</HI> of his <HI>Closet</HI>
to address himself to Mr. Secretary
<HI>Nicholas,</HI> from whom he was to take
directions for some special and impor∣tant
Service; which was at last signified
to Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> under the Kings own
hand, <HI>viz.</HI> to write the <HI>Weekly Occur∣rences</HI>
which befel his Majesties Go∣vernment
and Armies in the unnatural
War that was raised against him. The
Reverend Man was hugely unwilling
to undertake the employment, concei∣ving
it not only somewhat disagreeable
to the Dignity and Profession that he
had in the Church, and directly thwar∣ting
<PB N="124" REF="76"/>
his former Studies and Contem∣plations;
but that by a faithful dis∣charge
of his Duty in that Service, he
should expose both his Family and him∣self
to the implacable malice of those
persons, whose very mercies were Cru∣elty
and Blood. But no Arguments or
Intercessions could prevail to have him
excused from that Employment, at
least for some time, till he had made it
facile by his own diligence and exam∣ple.
Neither were dangers or difficul∣ties
of any moment with him, when
the Service of his Prince and Master
required his Labours and
Assistance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. in Vit. lul. Agr.</NOTE> <HI>Discere à peri∣tis,
sequi optimos, nihil
appetere ob jactationem, nihil ob formi∣dinem
recusare, simulque anxius &amp; in∣tentus
agere,</HI> is a Character as truly ap∣plicable
to Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> as to the brave
<HI>Roman</HI> of whom it was first written.
For he desired no employment out of
vain-glory, and refused none out of
fear, but equally was careful and in∣tent
in whatever he undertook; and
<PB N="125" REF="76"/>
at that time too, when he was denied
the poor <HI>Deanery</HI> of <HI>Chichester,</HI> for
which his Majesty was earnestly impor∣tuned
in his behalf by Mr. <HI>Secretary Ni∣cholas.</HI>
The <HI>Weekly Occurrences</HI> that
were wrote by him, he called by the
name of <HI>Mercurius Anglicus;</HI> which
name continued as long as the Cause
did for which it was written. And be∣sides
these weekly Tasks, being influ∣enced
by the same Royal Commands,
he writ divers other Treatises, before
he could obtain his <HI>Quietus est</HI> from
that ungrateful Employment, <HI>viz.</HI>
1. <HI>A Relation of the Lord</HI> Hopton'<HI>s
Victory at</HI> Bodwin. 2. <HI>A View of the
Proceedings in the West for Pacification.</HI>
3. <HI>A Letter to a Gentleman in</HI> Leice∣stershire
<HI>about the Treaty. 4. A Re∣lation
of the Queens Return from</HI> Hol∣land,
<HI>and the seizing of</HI> Newark. 5. <HI>A
Relation of the Proceedings of Sir</HI> John
Gell. 6. <HI>The Black Cross,</HI> shewing
that the <HI>Londoners</HI> were the cause of
the present Rebellion, with some others
that were never Printed.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="77"/>
These zealous services produced the
very same effect, that he foresaw when
he first undertook them. For in the
space of six months, he was voted a
<HI>Delinquent</HI> in the <HI>House of Commons;</HI>
this being given for a reason, <HI>viz.</HI> that
he resided and lived at <HI>Oxon.</HI> Upon
which, an Order was sent to the <HI>Com∣mittee</HI>
at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> to Sequester his
whole Estate and seize upon all his
Goods. And <HI>Reading</HI> being taken by
the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> a free and easie pas∣sage
was opened for the Execution of
those unrighteous Decrees. For in a
short space after, his Corn, Cattle and
Money were taken by one Captain
<HI>Watts,</HI> and all his Books carried to
<HI>Portsmouth.</HI> Colonel <HI>Norton</HI>'s hand be∣ing
set to the Warrant of his Sequestra∣tion,
he twice Petition'd to have some
Reparation out of his Estate; but was
denied the first time, and put off in a
more Courtly manner the last. Before
he left <HI>Alresford,</HI> he took care to hide
some of his choicest and most costly
Goods, designing the first opportunity
<PB N="127" REF="77"/>
to have them conveyed to <HI>Oxon.</HI> But
either by ill luck, or the treachery and
baseness of some of his Neighbours,
the Cart with all the Goods were ta∣ken
by part of <HI>Nortons</HI> Horse, and car∣ried
to <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> himself also vio∣lently
pursued, and by Divine Provi∣dence
delivered from the snare of those
Fowlers, who thirsted after his Blood
and lay in wait for his Life. The Cart
with all contained in it was carried to
<HI>Southampton,</HI> and delivered unto <HI>Nor∣ton</HI>
(Saintship then being the ground of
Propriety, as it afterward was of Sove∣reignty.)
A loss great in it self, but much
more so to a poor <HI>Divine;</HI> and chiefly
to be ascribed to a <HI>Colonel</HI> in the King's
Army, who denied to send a Convoy
of Horse for the guarding of his Goods,
although the Marquess of <HI>Newcastle</HI>
gave Order for it. And these Oppres∣sions
which he suffered from his Ene∣mies
were increased by as unjust pro∣ceedings
of those who ought to have
been his Friends. For part of the Royal
Army defaced his Parsonage-House at
<PB N="128" REF="78"/>
<HI>Alresford,</HI> making it unhabitable and
taking up all the Tithes; for which he
never had the least satisfaction, unless
it was the Manumission of himself from
the troublesome Employment under
Mr. Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and at his go∣ing
off, at the request of that worthy
Gentleman, he writ a little Book cal∣led
<HI>The Rebels Catechism.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus dismissed from business so
disagreeable to his <HI>Genius,</HI> he found
leisure to employ his Contemplative
thoughts about subjects more weighty
and serious. And having obeyed the
Commands of his Superiors, he endea∣voured
to satisfie the doubts of his
Friends; and particularly of one whose
thoughts were confusedly perplexed
about our <HI>Reformation.</HI> And to do
this, he drew up a Discourse in answer
to that common but groundless Ca∣lumny
of the Papists, who brand the
Religion of our Church with the nick∣name
of that which is <HI>Parliamentary.</HI>
But our Reverend Doctor Demon∣strates
in that Book how little, or in∣deed
<PB N="129" REF="78"/>
nothing the Parliament acted in
the <HI>Reformation.</HI> For some years indeed
that are past, there have been <HI>Parlia∣ments</HI>
that have had a <HI>Committee</HI> for
Religion, which is to have an Aposto∣lical
care of all the Churches. And our
Reverend Doctor observes that this cu∣stom
was first introduced into the
House of <HI>Commons,</HI> when the Divinity-School
in <HI>Oxon</HI> was made the Seat of
their Debates. For the <HI>Speaker</HI> being
placed in or near the <HI>Chair</HI> in which
the Kings <HI>Professor</HI> of Divinity did usu∣ally
read his publick Le∣ctures
and moderate in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations on the History of the Reign of K. <HI>Charles,</HI> 34.</NOTE>
all publick Disputations,
they were put into a
conceit, that the deter∣mining
in all Points and Controversies
in Divinity did belong to them. As <HI>Vi∣bius
Rufus</HI> having married <HI>Tullies</HI> Wi∣dow,
and bought <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Chair, con∣ceived
that he was then in a way to
gain the Eloquence of the one, and the
Power of the other. For, after this we
find no Parliament without a <HI>Com∣mittee</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="79"/>
for Religion, and no <HI>Committee</HI>
for Religion but what did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk it self
sufficiently instructed to mannage▪ the
greatest Controversies in Divinity
which were brought before them: And
with what success to the Religion here
by Law Established, we have seen too
clearly.
<Q>—Tractent fabrilia fabri.</Q>
Let things of a spiritual nature in the
name of God be debated and determi∣ned
by Spiritual persons. Doctrinal
matters are proper for the cognizance
of a <HI>Convocation▪</HI> not of a <HI>Committee;</HI>
which does often consist of wise men,
but the common Title
given to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Committee of Affectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> some of them,
does at least prove that
those wise men are not always either
the best Christians or greatest Clerks.</P>
<P>Neither were these things the only
Subjects of the vast mind and contem∣plative
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thoughts of this great man.
For toward the latter end of this year
(being 1644.) he Presented to his Ma∣jesty
<PB N="131" REF="79"/>
a Paper containing the Heads of a
Discourse writ by him, called, <HI>The
Stumbling-block of Disobedience remo∣ved</HI>—in
answer to and examination of
the two last Sections in Mr. <HI>Calvins
Institutions,</HI> against Sovereign Monar∣chy.
The Lord <HI>Hatton,</HI> the Bishop of
<HI>Sarum,</HI> Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgman,</HI> and Dr.
<HI>Steward</HI> perused the whole Treatise,
and the King approving of the Con∣tents,
commanded the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> fur∣ther
to consider the Book, in whose
hands it did for a long time rest; nei∣ther
was it made publick till about ten
years after the War was ended.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1645.
he left <HI>Oxon,</HI> and went into <HI>Hampshire,</HI>
settling himself and Family at <HI>Winche∣ster;
Alresford</HI> with all the rest of his
Preferments being taken from him, and
having nothing to subsist upon besides
his own Temporal Estate. And yet
even now the exuberancy of an honest
zeal (that I may use his own words
though upon another occasion) carried
him rather to the maintenance of his
<PB N="132" REF="80"/>
Brethrens and the Churches Cause,
than to the preservation of his own
peace and particular contentments.
And therefore considering unto what a
deplorable condition the poor Loyal
Clergy were reduced, how they were
<HI>hungry and thirsty,</HI> and their <HI>souls</HI> rea∣dy
to <HI>faint in them;</HI> as also how the
Parliament were about to establish
those <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ministers for term
of life in those Livings, out of which
himself and many others were ejected,
he drew up some <HI>Considerations,</HI> and
presented them to some Members of
the House of <HI>Commons,</HI> to see whether
he could move them to any Christian
Charity and Compassion. And they
are so clear and convincing, that they
would have prevailed upon any, but
those that were made up all of Guts,
but no Bowels. They are these that
follow.</P>
<P>1. <Q>The Clergy which were sequa∣strated
in the time of the Long Par∣liament,
were charged for the most
part with no other Crime, than their
<PB N="133" REF="80"/>
adhaesion to the late King in the long
course of his Troubles; which many
of them did in gratitude for Prefer∣ments
received; others in relation to
their services and personal Duties;
and all as I conceive out of consci∣ence
of that Loyalty and Allegiance,
in which by their several Oaths and
Subscriptions they were bound to
him.</Q></P>
<P>2. <Q>Sequestration is in Law no o∣ther
than a suspension à <HI>Beneficio,</HI> de∣priving
a man only of the profits,
not of the rights of his Incumbency;
nor leaving him in an incapacity in
returning to those profits again, upon
the taking off of the Sequestration,
or Suspension, which in the intend∣ment
of the Law is reckoned only
for a temporary, no perpetual punish∣ment.</Q></P>
<P>3. <Q>The persons put into those Be∣nefices
have been ever since looked
upon but as Curates, not as Proprie∣taries
of those Livings; and in the
wisdom of the Parliament were con∣sidered
<PB N="134" REF="81"/>
but as Tenants at will, or
<HI>quamdiu benè se gesserint</HI> at the best:
the power of presenting to those Li∣vings
upon the death or deprivation
of the right Incumbent, being left
wholly to the Patron, as by Law it
ought; which kept those Ministers
(for the most part Presbyterian) in a
continual obnoxiousness to the Com∣mands
and Will of that Parliament,
to which they were very useful on all
occasions.</Q></P>
<P>4. <Q>The Bill now brought into the
House for settling those new Mini∣sters
for term of life, hath many
things which seem worthy of conside∣ration,
as carrying in it many disad∣vantages
to parties interessed therein,
and something prejudicial to the pub∣lick
peace: For,</Q></P>
<P>1. <Q>It deprives the right Patron
of his lawful power of nominating
to those Livings, descended to him
from his Ancestors, or purchased
by his money; and consequently
settled on him in as strong a way,
<PB N="135" REF="81"/>
as the established Laws of the
Land could confirm the same.</Q></P>
<P>2. <Q>It destroys many a learned,
peaceable and Religious man with∣out
hope of remedy; but serves
withal for a great justification of
their Innocence, when for want of
Crime to proceed upon, and lega∣lity
in their conviction, the power
of the legislative Sword is fain to
be made use of to effect the busi∣ness.</Q></P>
<P>3. <Q>It subverts those ends for
which those men were first put in∣to
their Livings; who being set∣tled
in the same for term of life by
Act of Parliament, and following
the impetuosity of their own spi∣rits,
will be apt when time and
opportunity serves, to let fly all
their fury at the present Govern∣ment,
as they did formerly at the
other in the late Kings Reign. And
though it be conceiv'd by some,
that the Ordinance for ejecting
scandalous Ministers will be curb
<PB N="136" REF="82"/>
sufficient to hold them in, yet I find
no such thing as turbulent and fa∣ctious
Preachings to be specified a∣mongst
the scandals which are
therein enumerated.</Q></P>
<P>5. <Q>Whereas it is intended that the
Minister thus deprived shall have a
<HI>Fifth</HI> part of the Profits of the Li∣ving,
if he be not otherwise provi∣ded
of some temporal means suffici∣ent
to maintain himself and Family,
I conceive with all submission to bet∣ter
Judgments, that the said limitati∣on
will be occasion of much trouble
to the men deprived, if it doth not
quite overthrow the benefit intended
to them; that being a sufficient means
for one man which is not for another,
with reference to their Degrees, Fa∣milies
and ways of Living: whereas
to these new-comers-in the profits of
the Living will be always certainly
sufficient with an <HI>Over-plus,</HI> if we
measure by that Standard wherewith
they make others; it being no un∣usual
thing in some of that Party to
<PB N="137" REF="82"/>
tell the sequestred Clergy, when they
sued for their <HI>Fifths, That it was
sufficient for them to be suffered to live.</HI>
And then assuredly
<Q>—Populo satis est Fluvius{que} Ceresque.</Q>
It will be accounted a high degree of
sufficiency (if not of superfluity ra∣ther)
that they have wherewithal to
buy themselves a morsel of Bread and
a cup of cold Water.</Q></P>
<P>And accordingly as this Reverend
Person foretold, so it came to pass.
For when the <HI>Presbyterian Intruders</HI>
were settled in the Benefices of the Se∣questred
Clergy for term of life, al∣though
the <HI>Commissioners</HI> for <HI>Rejecting
of Scandalous Ministers</HI> had power to
grant a <HI>Fifth</HI> part, together with the
Arrears thereof to the Ejected Clergy,
yet the <HI>Bill</HI> was clogg'd with two such
circumstances, as made it unuseful to
some and but a little beneficial to the
rest. For first it was ordered that no
man should receive any benefit by the
<PB N="138" REF="83"/>
<HI>Bill,</HI> who had either 30 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> in
<HI>Real,</HI> or 500 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>Personal</HI> Estate: By
means whereof many who had former∣ly
500 <HI>l.</HI> yearly to maintain their Fa∣milies,
were tied up to so poor a pit∣tance,
as would hardly keep their
Children from begging in the open
Streets. And 2dly. There was such
a power given to the <HI>Commissioners,</HI>
that not exceeding the <HI>Fifth</HI> part, they
might give to the poor Sequestred
Clergy as much and as little as they
pleased, under that pro∣portion.
And the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Exam. Hist. p. 111.</NOTE> Do∣ctor
instances in one of
his certain knowledg, who for an Ar∣rear
of 12 years out of a Benefice Ren∣ted
formerly for 250 <HI>l, per ann.</HI> obtai∣ned
but 3 <HI>l. 6 s. 8 d.</HI> (the first Intru∣der
being then alive and possessed of
the Benefice) and no more than 20
<HI>Marks per ann.</HI> for his future subsi∣stence;
which is but a <HI>Nineteenth</HI> part
instead of a <HI>Fifth.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after which Oppressions,
the <HI>Intruders</HI> themselves were in as
<PB N="139" REF="83"/>
imminent danger to be devested of all
their maintenance, as the Loyal Cler∣gy,
who had suffered the utmost extre∣mity
of Cruelty and Injustice. For
<HI>Tithes</HI> being represented as a <HI>Publick
Grievance</HI> in the <HI>Rump-Parliament,</HI> the
Gentry were in a fair way to be depri∣ved
of their <HI>Impropriations,</HI> and the
<HI>Presbyterians</HI> themselves of their Pa∣trimony.
And although our Reverend
<HI>Doctor</HI> paid <HI>Tithes</HI> himself, and there∣fore
had no Obligations to appear in
the defence of them for private Ends or
Interests, yet for the upholding of the
common Christianity and some kind
of standing Ministry in the Nation, he
endeavoured in a modest and rational
way the <HI>undeceiving of the people</HI> in
that particular. For whereas it was ob∣jected</P>
<P>1. That the maintenance allowed
the Clergy was <HI>too great for their Cal∣ling;</HI>
He shewed that <HI>never any Clergy
in the Church of God hath been, or is
maintained with less charge to the Sub∣ject,
than the Established Clergy of the
Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="84"/>
2. <HI>Whereas it was objected that
their</HI> Maintenance was made up out of
the Tenth part of each mans estate; <HI>He
demonstrated,</HI> That there is no man in
the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> who pays any
thing of his own toward the Maintenance
of his Parish-Minister, but his Easter-Offerings.</P>
<P>3. Whereas it is suggested, That
the <HI>changing of this way by the payment
of Tithes into Stipends,</HI> wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be more
<HI>grateful to the Country, and more ease to
the Clergy;</HI> He proved, <HI>That the chan∣ging
of Tithes into Stipends would bring
greater trouble to the Clergy, than is yet
considered, and far less profit to the Coun∣try,
than was then pretended.</HI> So zea∣lous
was this excellent person, not on∣ly
for his Friends and Fellow-sufferers,
<HI>viz.</HI> the poor oppressed and ejected
Clergy; but for his very enemies the
<HI>Intruders,</HI> that had Preach'd the King
out of his Life, and himself and Bre∣thren
out of all their Livelihoods and
Preferments. And at that time too his
zeal appeared, when he was by a small
<PB N="141" REF="84"/>
temporal Estate incapacitated to receive
the least benefit by any Act of Mercy
that could accrue to him by his labours
in that particular: Nay had the pro∣ject
of <HI>removing Hirelings out of the
Church</HI> (as it was then phrased) taken
effect, Doctor <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s Estate would
have received considerable improve∣ments
and advantages. For which he
was fain to compound with the <HI>Com∣mittee-men</HI>
in <HI>Goldsmiths-Hall</HI> in the
year 1645. But he has left no memo∣rial
of what he paid to those insatiable
Leeches and Oppressors. However he
sped well, as the case stood with him.
For being (as was before observed) vo∣ted
a <HI>Delinquent,</HI> the Parliament mar∣ked
him out for an Oblation, resol∣ving,
that whenever they could get
<HI>Heylyn</HI> into their snares, who had been
an instrument of so much mischief to
them, his Blood should appease their
Fury, and expiate his own Guilts. But
being at the Siege at <HI>Oxon,</HI> he shared
with the <HI>Royallists</HI> in the common be∣nefit
of those <HI>Articles,</HI> that were made
<PB N="142" REF="85"/>
at the surrender of that City; and by
that means saved his Life, as well as
his Estate.</P>
<P><HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1648. he settled himself
and Family at <HI>Minster-Lovel</HI> in <HI>Oxford∣shire.</HI>
And although he had lost his Li∣brary
(which for choiceness of Authors
was inferior to few Clergy-mens in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>)
and therefore might well be dee∣med
unfit to write Books for others,
when he was robb'd of his own; yet
he would not permit his own private
<HI>Oeconomicks</HI> to swallow up his precious
minutes, but endeavoured to benefit
his Country, and to divert his mind
from the sad complexion of the times,
by enlarging his <HI>Geography</HI> into a <HI>Cos∣mography;</HI>
which as it now remains per∣fected
by him, may be truly averr'd to
be a Repository of as much useful and
delightful Learning, as any published
either in that present, or in preceding
Ages. It is true many material Errors
were justly charged upon it, when it
was a <HI>Geography,</HI> but his own Apology
is more powerful than any can be made
<PB N="143" REF="85"/>
in his behalf;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preface to the <HI>Cosmography.</HI></NOTE> <Q>for being
writ in an Age, on
which the pride of
Youth and Self-opinion might have
some predominancies, I thought it
freer from mistakes than since I have
found it: and those mistakes by run∣ning
through eight Editions (six of
them without my perusal or supervi∣sing)
so increased and multiplied, that
I could no longer call it mine, or look
upon it with any tolerable degree of
patience.</Q></P>
<P>If it be said, that as 'tis now com∣pleted
by him, he has as well run into
new Errors, as corrected the old ones;
it may be so too. For those humane
Abilities are yet to be named, that were
in all things governed by an infallible
Spirit. And no man that is not so gui∣ded,
can plead the privilege of not be∣ing
liable to mistakes. But his own
words are the most satisfactory answer
to this objection. <Q>I must have been a

<HI>Greek Vlysses,</HI> or the <HI>English Mande∣ville,</HI>

bargain, if in describing of the whole
world, with all the Kingdoms, Pro∣vinces,
Seas and Isles thereof, I had
not relied more on the Credit of
others, than any knowledg of my
own. But if any Gentleman, Mer∣chant,
or other Traveller shall please
to let me understand in what those
Authors, which I trusted, have mis∣informed
me, let it be done in jest or
earnest, in love or anger, in a fair man∣ner
or a foul, with respect or dis-re∣spect
unto me, in what way soever, I
shall most thankfully receive the In∣structions
from him, and give him the
honour of the Reformation, when
that Book shall come out in another
Edition. I will neither kick against
those who rub upon such sores as I
have about me, nor fling dirt on them
who shall take the pains to bestow a
brushing on my Coat. I was trained
up, when I was a Child, to kiss the

<P>In the year 1653. he removed to
<HI>Lacies-Court</HI> in <HI>Abingdon.</HI> For being
<Q>robb'd of his choicest Companions,</Q>
his Books; he resolved to fix himself as
near as possibly he could to <HI>Oxford;</HI>
loss of time, together with the charge
and trouble of a Journey, rendring his
Visits less frequent to the <HI>Bedleian</HI> Li∣brary,
than would well comport with
his condition. For al∣though
he was a <HI>Living
Library,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">As <HI>Euscapius</HI> said of <HI>Longinus.</HI></NOTE> <HI>a Locomotive
<PB N="146" REF="87"/>
Study,</HI> a Scribe fully instructed in the
Kingdom of God, a Housholder that
could bring out of his Treasury things
both new and old, yet for all that he
resolved to continue a laborious Sear∣cher
after Wisdom, and gave his Flesh
no rest, that he might entertain his
mind with the noblest Contemplati∣ons:
neither would he fix his thoughts
upon notional and useless Speculations,
but whenever he could by any kind of
labour either of Body or Brain be real∣ly
serviceable to the just Interests of his
Prince or Church, he refused no pains
or expences, but would undergo (to
others) the most unsupportable bur∣thens,
to restifie his zealous affection
unto both. One instance of which is evi∣dent
in what he contributed to Saint
<HI>Nicholas</HI> Church in <HI>Abingdon,</HI> the ut∣ter
demolishing of which was resolved
on by the Sacrilegious Schismaticks of
those times.</P>
<P>The then <HI>Vsurping Powers</HI> had by
the severest <HI>Edicts</HI> solemnly interdi∣cted
the Regular Clergy, the discharge
<PB N="147" REF="87"/>
of their publick Ministry in the sacred
Offices of Religion: Nay they were
forbid the teaching and instructing of
Youth in all private houses, though
they wanted the necessaries of Humane
Life for themselves and Families. In
which sad prospect of Affairs, our <HI>Di∣vine</HI>
built a private <HI>Oratory,</HI> where he
had frequency of <HI>Synaxes;</HI> the <HI>Liturgy</HI>
of the Church being daily read by him,
and the Holy <HI>Eucharist</HI> administred as
often as opportunity gave leave; many
devout and well-affected persons, after
the manner of the Primitive Christians
when they lived under Heathen per∣secutions,
resorting to his little Chap∣pel,
that there they might wrestle with
the Almighty for his blessing upon
themselves, and upon a divided infa∣tuated
people. But in a few years, the
rage of the <HI>Higher Powers</HI> abating, the
<HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church began in some
places to be publickly read; and Mr.
<HI>Huish</HI> (then Minister in <HI>Abingdon</HI>) had
a numerous Auditory of Loyal per∣sons,
who frequented publick Prayers
<PB N="148" REF="88"/>
at St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> which became so great∣ly
offensive to the Factious party, that
they laboured all they could to have the
Church raz'd to its very Foundations:
But notwithstanding the Authority
which then ruled, God rendred the en∣deavours
of Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> and some other
<HI>Royallists</HI> successful in the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervation
of his own house. And because Mr.
<HI>Huish</HI> either out of a principle of pru∣dence
or fear had for some time whilst
those contests continued. desisted from
performing the sacred Offices of Reli∣gion,
therefore our Doctor to animate
him unto the performance of his Duty,
sent him the following Letter after his
return from <HI>London,</HI> where he had been
soliciting in the common Cause of the
Church, which was to have been laid
even with the ground.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>We are much beholden to you for
your chearful condescending unto our
desires, so for as to the Lords-days
Service; which though it be <HI>Opus
<PB N="149" REF="88"/>
Diei in Die suo,</HI> yet we cannot think
our selves to be fully masters of our
requests, till you have yielded to be∣stow
your pains on the other days al∣so.
We hope in reasonable time to al∣ter
the condition of Mr. <HI>Blackwel</HI>'s
pious Gift, that without hazzarding
the loss of his Donation, which
would be an irrecoverable blow unto
this poor Parish, you may sue out
your <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etus est</HI> from that daily At∣tendance,
unless you find some fur∣ther
motives and inducements to per∣suade
you to it: yet so to alter it, that
there shall be no greater wrong done
to his Intentions, than to most part
of he Founders of each University,
by changing Prayers for the Souls
first by them intended, into a Com∣memoration
of their Bounties as was
practised. All dispositions of this
kind must vary with those changes
which befal the Church, or else be
alienated and estranged to other pur∣poses.
I know it must be some dis∣couragement
to you to read to Walls,
<PB N="150" REF="89"/>
or to pray in publick with so thin a
company, as hardly will amount to
a Congregation: But withal I desire
you to consider, that <HI>magis</HI> and <HI>minus,</HI>
all <HI>Logicians</HI> say, do not change the
<HI>Species</HI> of things; that Quantities of
themselves are of little efficacy (if at
all of any) and that he who promised
to be in the midst of two or three
when they meet together in his
name, hath clearly shewed, that
even the smallest Congregations shall
not want his presence. And why
then should we think much to bestow
our pains where he vouchsafes his
presence? or think our labour ill be∣stowed,
if some few only do partake
of the present benefit? And yet no
doubt the benefit extends to more than
the parties present: For you know
well that the Priest or Minister is not
only to pray with, but for the peo∣ple;
that he is not only to offer up
the peoples Prayers to Almighty God,
but to offer up his own Prayers for
them; the benefit whereof may cha∣ritably
<PB N="151" REF="89"/>
be presumed to extend to, as
well as it was intended for, the ab∣sent
also. And if a whole Nation may
be represented in a Parliament of
400 persons, and they derive the
Blessings of Peace and Comfort upon
all the Land, why may we not con∣ceive
that God will look on three or
four of this little Parish, as the <HI>Re∣presentative</HI>
of the whole, and for
their sakes extend his Grace and Bles∣sings
unto all the rest; that he who
would have saved that sinful City
of <HI>Sodom,</HI> had he found but ten
righteous persons in it, may not
vouchsafe to bless a less sinful people
upon the Prayers of a like or less
number of Pious and Religious per∣sons.
When the High Priest went in∣to
the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI> to make
Atonement for the Sins of the Peo∣ple,
went he not thither by himself?
none of the people being suffered to
enter into that place. Do not we read,
that when <HI>Zacharias</HI> offered up In∣cense,
which figured the Prayers of
<PB N="152" REF="90"/>
the Saints within the Temple, the
people waited all that while in the
outward Courts? Or find we any
where that the Priest, who offered
up the daily Sacrifice (and this comes
nearest to our Case) did ever intermit
that Office by reason of the slackness
or indevotion of the people in repai∣ring
to it? But you will say <HI>There is
a Lion in the way,</HI> there is danger in
it. Assuredly I hope none at all; or
if any, none that you would care for.
The Sword of the <HI>Committee</HI> had as
sharp an edg, and was managed
with as strong a malice, as any Or∣dinance
of later <HI>Date</HI> can impower
men with. Having so fortunately e∣scaped
the danger of that. why
should you think of any thing but
despising this? as <HI>Tully</HI> did unto
<HI>Mark Antonie, Catilinae Gladios con∣tempsi,
non timebo tuos.</HI> Why may you
not conclude with <HI>David</HI> in the like
sense and apprehensions of Gods pre∣servation,
that he who saved him
from the Bear and the Lion, would
<PB N="153" REF="90"/>
also save him from the Sword of that
railing <HI>Philistine.</HI> And you may see
that the Divine Providence is still a∣wake
over that poor Remnant of
the Regular and Orthodox Clergy,
which have not yet bowed their knees
to the <HI>Golden Calves</HI> of late erected,
by putting so unexpectedly a hook
into the nostrils of those <HI>Leviathans</HI>
which threatned with an open mouth
to devour them all. I will not say
as <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> did in a
case much like that, it is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
to indulge too much to apprehensi∣ons
of this nature in matters which
relate to Gods publick Service. All
I shall add is briefly this, that ha∣ving
presented you with these Consi∣derations,
I shall with greediness ex∣pect
the sounding of the Bell to mor∣row
morning; and in the mean time
make my Prayers to Almighty God
so to direct you in this business, as
may be most for his Glory, your
own particular Comfort, and the
good of this people: with which ex∣pressions
<PB N="154" REF="91"/>
of my Soul, I subscribe
my self,</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon the receipt and reading of
this Letter, Mr. <HI>Huish</HI> betook himself
to his wonted duty, reading the
Churches Prayers with that frequency,
gravity and devotion as became a man
of his Reverence and Profession.</P>
<P>And the daily visits which were paid
by our Doctor to the place of Gods pub∣lick
Worship, the better enabled him as
well to undergo the severity of Study,
as to contend with the hardships of For∣tune.
And amongst the products of his
Studies, the <HI>Theologia Veterum</HI> or Ex∣position
of the Apostles <HI>Creed</HI> does
first merit our Commendations. In∣deed
many other Books were written
by him, when the King and Church
were in their low and calamitous con∣dition;
<PB N="155" REF="91"/>
some of which were <HI>Historical</HI>
relating to matters of <HI>Fact;</HI> some <HI>Po∣litical,</HI>
relating to the power of Prin∣ces
and various Forms of Government;
and lastly others <HI>Theological;</HI> and those
either <HI>Didactical,</HI> tending to the settling
and informing of mens understandings;
or <HI>Practical,</HI> that conduced to the a∣mending
of their manners; or <HI>Polemi∣cal,</HI>
that vindicated the Truths of God
and Unity of his Church against the
Errors, Schisms and Persecutions of
its Enemies, whether <HI>Papists, Socinians,</HI>
or <HI>Disciplinarians.</HI> His Book upon the
<HI>Creed</HI> is a mixture of all these excellent
Ingredients; insomuch that whoever
would be acquainted with the Sence
of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> Fathers upon
the Twelve <HI>Articles</HI> of our Faith, as
also with <HI>Positive, Polemical</HI> and <HI>Philo∣logical
Theology,</HI> he will not find either
his labour lost, or his time mispended, if
he peruse what our learned <HI>Doctor</HI> has
writ upon that Subject.</P>
<P>But neither Learning or Innocency
are a sufficient safe-guard against the
<PB N="156" REF="92"/>
assaults of mischievous and malicious
men; many of whom combined toge∣ther
to render Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> as infamous
in his Name, as they had before made
him improsperous in his Estate And to
that purpose they used their utmost
endeavours to have one of his Books
burned (called <HI>Respondet Petrus</HI>) by an
Order from <HI>Olivers Council-Table.</HI> For
Dr. <HI>N. Bernard</HI> Preacher of <HI>Grays-Inn</HI>
putting out a Book, entituled, <HI>The
Iudgment of the Lord Primate of</HI> Ire∣land,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> our Reverend <HI>Doctor</HI> being
therein accused for violating his Sub∣scription
and running cross to the pub∣lick
Doctrine of the Church or <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
as also being taxed with Sophi∣stry,
Shamelesness, and some other
things which he could not well endure
either from the <HI>Dead,</HI> or the <HI>Living,</HI>
he returned an Answer to it, against
which, <HI>Articles</HI> were presently formed
and presented to the then <HI>Council-Table;</HI>
and the common Rumor went, that
the Book was publickly
burnt: A fame (as the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Certam Epist. 100.</NOTE>
<PB N="157" REF="92"/>
Doctor says) that had little truth in it,
though more colour for it, than many
other charges which had been laid up∣on
him. He was in <HI>London,</HI> when he
received the first notice of it; and
though he was persuaded by his friends
to neglect the matter, as that which
would redound to his honour, and
knew very well what Sentence had
been passed by <HI>Tacitus</HI> upon the Or∣der
of <HI>Senate,</HI> or <HI>Roman Consul</HI> for
burning the Books of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. An. lib. 4.</NOTE>
<HI>Cremutius Cordus</HI> the
<HI>Historian, Neque aliud externi Reges,
aut qui eâdem saevitiâ usi sunt, nisi de∣decus
sibi atque illis gloriam peperere,
i. e.</HI> they gained nothing but ignominy
to themselves and glory to all those
whose Books they burnt; yet our Do∣ctor
was rather in that particular of
Sir <HI>Iohn Falstaff</HI>'s mind, not liking such
grinning honour; and therefore rather
chose to prevent the Obloquy, than
boast in it. To which purpose he ap∣plied
himself to the Lord Mayor of
<HI>London</HI> and a great Man in the <HI>Council</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="93"/>
of <HI>State,</HI> and receiving from them a
true information of what had passed,
he left his Solicitude, being quite freed
from all fear and danger.</P>
<P>About this time it was that the King,
Church and Church-men were arraign∣ed
and traduced by many voluminous
Writers of the Age; and the Doctor be∣ing
solicited to answer them by Letters,
Messages and several personal Addres∣ses,
by men of all Orders and Dignities
in the Church, and of all Degrees in the
Universities, was at last overcome by
their Importunities; the irresistible In∣treaties
of so many Friends having
something in them of Commands. And
the first Author, whose Mistakes, Fal∣sities
and Defects he examined, was
Mr. <HI>Thomas Fuller</HI> the <HI>Church-Histo∣rian,</HI>
who intermingling his <HI>History</HI>
with some dangerous Positions, which
if reduced into practice, would over∣throw
the Power of the <HI>Church,</HI> and
lay a probable Foundation for Distur∣bances
in the <HI>Civil-State;</HI> the Doctor
made some <HI>Animadversions</HI> on him by
<PB N="159" REF="93"/>
way of <HI>Antidote,</HI> that so, if possible,
he might be read without danger. An∣other
was Mr. <HI>Sanderson</HI>'s long <HI>History</HI>
of the Life and Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI>
I. whose errors being of that nature as
might mis-guide the Reader in the way
of Knowledg and Discourse, our <HI>Doctor</HI>
rectified him with some <HI>Advertise∣ments,</HI>
that so he might be read with
the greater profit. It would swell these
Papers into too great a bulk, if I should
give a particular account of the Con∣tests
that this Reverend man had with
Mr. <HI>Harington,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hickman,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Baxter;</HI> the last of which was so very
bold as to disgorge himself upon the
whole Clergy of <HI>Eng∣land</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. Ded. be∣fore <HI>Cert. Epist.</HI></NOTE>
in his <HI>Grotian</HI> Reli∣gion,
<HI>which caused</HI> in our
Doctor, (as he tells his Brethren the
old Regular Clergy) <HI>So great an horror
and amazement, that he could not tell
whether or no he could give any credit
to his Senses; the words sounding loud
in his ears and not sinking at first into
his heart.</HI> Neither Did Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> ar∣raign
<PB N="160" REF="94"/>
the whole Clergy in general, but
more particularly directed his Spleen
against Dr. <HI>Heylyn;</HI> whose name he
<HI>wish'd</HI> afterwards <HI>he had spared.</HI> But it
was whilst he was living; he has made
more bold with him since he was dead;
and that for no other reason (that I can
learn) but for exposing the Follies,
Falshoods, and uncharitableness of a
daring and rash Writer, who never re∣turned
one word of Answer (besides
Railing and Reproaches) unto what
our <HI>Doctor</HI> Published against him.</P>
<P>And having made mention of these
Authors, against whom our excellent
Doctor appeared in the Lists, it may
not perhaps be deemed unacceptable
to those Readers who are either un∣able
to buy, or unwilling to read the
Books written against them, to tran∣scribe
some particular passages which
may be a farther testification of the
zeal of this great Scholar for the King
and Church.</P>
<P>And the first (relating to the King)
shall be about the <HI>Coronation;</HI> it being
<PB N="161" REF="94"/>
a piece of new <HI>State-Do∣ctrine,</HI>
that the <HI>Corona∣tion</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exam. Histor. 201.</NOTE>
of the King should
depend upon the consent of the Lords
and Commons assembled in Parliament.
For in the Form and Manner of the
<HI>Coronation</HI> of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. de∣scribed
in the <HI>Catalogue of Honour,</HI> set
forth by <HI>Thomas Mills</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,
Anno Dom.</HI> 1610, we find it thus:
<Q>The King being carried by certain
Noble Courtiers in another Chair un∣to
the four sides of the Stage, was by
the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> decla∣red
to the people standing round a∣bout,
both by Gods and mans Laws
to be the Right and Lawful King of
<HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
proclaimed that day to be Crowned,
Consecrated and Anointed: unto
whom he demanded, Whether they
would Obey and Serve, or not? By
whom it was again with a loud cry
answered, <HI>God save the King, and ever
live his Majesty.</HI></Q> The same we have
in substance both in fewer words in the
<PB N="162" REF="95"/>
<HI>Coronation</HI> of King <HI>Iames;</HI> where it is
said, <Q>The King was shewed to the
people, and that they were required
to make acknowledgment of their Al∣legiance
to his Majesty by the Arch∣bishop,
which they did with Accla∣mations.</Q>
But assuredly (says Dr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI>) the difference is exceeding vast
between <HI>Obeying</HI> and <HI>Consenting;</HI> be∣tween
the peoples <HI>acknowledging their
Allegiance, and promising to Obey and
Serve their Lawful</HI> Sovereign, <HI>and gi∣ving
their Consent</HI> to his <HI>Coronation,</HI> as
if it could not be performed without it.
This makes the King to be either made
or unmade by his people, according to
the <HI>Maxim</HI> of <HI>Buchanan, Populo jus est,
imperium cui velit deferat:</HI> than which
passage there is nothing in all his Books
more pestilent or seditious.</P>
<P>Neither is another <HI>Position</HI> any less
derogatory to Regal Power, <HI>viz. That
Parliaments are to be Assistant to the
King in the exercise of his Regal Go∣vernment.</HI>
Unto which our excellent
<HI>Doctor</HI> says, <Q>That Parliaments or
<PB N="163" REF="95"/>
Common-Councils con∣sisting
of the Prelates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cert. Epist. 243.</NOTE>
Peers and other great
men of the Realm were frequently
held in the time of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings,
and that the <HI>Commons</HI> were first cal∣led
to those great Assemblies at the
Coronation of K. <HI>Henry</HI> I. to the end
that his Succession to the Crown be∣ing
approved by the Nobility and
People, he might have the better co∣lour
to exclude his Brother. And as
the Parliament was not instituted by
King <HI>Henry</HI> III. so was it not institu∣ted
by him to become an <HI>Assistant</HI> to
him in the Government, unless it
were from some of the Declarations
of the <HI>Commons</HI> in the <HI>Long Parlia∣ment,</HI>
in which it is frequently af∣firmed,
<HI>That the Fundamental Go∣vernment
of this Realm is by King,
Lords and Commons;</HI> which if so, then
what became of the government of
this Kingdom under <HI>Henry</HI> III. when
he had no such Assistants joyned with
him? Or what became of the Foun∣dation
<PB N="164" REF="96"/>
in the Intervals of following
Parliaments, when there was neither
<HI>Lords</HI> nor <HI>Commons</HI> on which the Go∣vernment
could be laid? And there∣fore
it must be apparently necessary,
either that the Parliaments were not
instituted by King <HI>Henry</HI> III. to be
his <HI>Assistants</HI> in the Government; or
else that for the greatest space of time
since <HI>Henry</HI> III. the Kingdom hath
been under no Government at all for
want of such <HI>Assistants.</HI> And I would
fain learn, who should be Judg tou∣ching
the <HI>Fitness</HI> or <HI>Vnfitness</HI> of such
Laws and Liberties, by which the
People and Nobility are to be grati∣fied
by their Kings: For if the Kings
themselves must judg it, it is not
likely that they will part with any
of their just Prerogatives, which
might make them less obeyed at
home, or less feared abroad, but
where invincible necessity or violent
importunity might force them to it.
And then the Laws and Liberties,
which were so extorted were either
<PB N="165" REF="96"/>
violated or annulled whensoever the
<HI>Granter</HI> was in power to weaken or
make void the <HI>Grant;</HI> for <HI>Malus diu∣turnitatis
Custos est metus.</HI> But if the
People must be Judges of such Laws
and Liberties as were fittest for them,
there would be no end of their De∣mands,
unreasonable in their own
nature and in number infinite. For
when they meet with a King of the
<HI>Giving hand,</HI> they will press him so
to give from one point to another, till
he give away Royalty it self; and if
they be not satisfied in all their <HI>Ask∣ings,</HI>
they will be pleased with none of
his former <HI>Grants.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But that which pared the Preroga∣tive
to the quick, was, that the <HI>Re∣formation</HI>
of Religion was the Pro∣vince
of the People, or that they might
do their Duty in the business when the
King omitted his; concerning which
our excellent <HI>Doctor</HI> delivers his judg∣ment
in these clear and convincing
words, [<HI>Exam. Hist.</HI> 135.] <Q>That Idola∣try
is to be destroyed by all them that
<PB N="166" REF="97"/>
have power to do it, is easily granted.
But then it must be understood of law∣ful
Power, and not permitted to the li∣berty
of unlawful violence. <HI>Id possumus
quod jure possumus,</HI> was the Rule of old,
and it hath held good in all attempts
for Reformation in the elder times.
For when the Fabrick of the <HI>Iewish</HI>
Church was out of order, and the
whole Worship of the Lord either de∣filed
with Superstitions, or intermin∣gled
with Idolatries, as it was too of∣ten;
did not Gods Servants tarry and
wait for leisure, till those who were
Supreme both in Place and Power,
were by him prompted and inflamed
to a Reformation? How many years
had that whole People made an Idol
of the <HI>Brazen-Serpent</HI> and burnt In∣cense
to it, before it was defaced by
<HI>Hezekiah?</HI> How many more might
it have stood longer undefac'd, un∣touch'd
by any of the common Peo∣ple,
had not the King given order to
demolish it? How many years had the
seduced <HI>Israelites</HI> adored before the
<PB N="167" REF="97"/>
<HI>Altar</HI> at <HI>Bethel,</HI> before it was hewn
down and cut in pieces by the good
<HI>Iosiah?</HI> And yet it cannot be denied
but that it was much in the power of
the <HI>Iews</HI> to destroy that <HI>Idol,</HI> and of
the honest and Religious <HI>Israelites</HI>
to break down that <HI>Altar,</HI> as it ei∣ther
was or could be in the power of
our <HI>English</HI> Zealots to beat down <HI>Su∣perstitious
Pictures</HI> and Images, had
they been so minded. <HI>Solomon</HI> in the
Book of <HI>Canticles</HI> compares the
Church to an <HI>Army, Acies castrorum
ordinata,</HI> as the <HI>Vulgar</HI> hath it; <HI>An
Army terrible with Banners,</HI> as we
read it: A powerful Body without
doubt, able which way soever it
moves to wast and destroy the Coun∣try,
to burn and sack the Villages
through which it passes. And que∣stionless
many of the Soldiers know∣ing
their own <HI>Power,</HI> would be apt
to do it, if not restrained by the Au∣thority
of their Com∣manders and the <HI>Laws</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. Hist. l. 1.</NOTE>
of War. <HI>Ita se ducum Authoritas, sic
<PB N="168" REF="98"/>
gor disciplinae habet,</HI> as we find in
<HI>Tacitus.</HI> And if those be not kept as
they ought to be, <HI>Confusi equites pedi∣tesque
in exitium ruunt;</HI> the whole runs
to a swift destruction. Thus it is al∣so
in the Church with the Camp of
God; If there be no subordination
in it, if every one might do what he
list himself, and make such uses of
that power and opportunity as he
thinks are put into his hands▪ what
a confusion would insue? how speedy
a calamity must needs fall upon it?
Courage and zeal do never shew
more zealously in inferiour powers,
than when they are subordinate unto
good Directions, from the right hand,
<HI>i. e.</HI> from the Supreme Magistrate,
not from the interests and passions of
their Fellow-Subjects. It is the
Princes Office to Command, and
theirs to execute; with which wise
Caution the Emperor <HI>Otho</HI> once re∣prest
the too great forwardness of his
Soldiers, when he found them apt
enough to make use of that power
<PB N="169" REF="98"/>
in a matter not com∣manded
by him. <HI>Vobis</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tacit.</HI> Hist. l. 1.</NOTE>
<HI>arma &amp; animus, mihi Concilium &amp;
virtutis vestrae Regimen relinquite,</HI>
as his words are. He understood their
Duty and his own Authority; al∣lows
them to have power and will,
but regulates and restrains them both
unto his own Command. So that
whether we behold the Church in its
own condition, proceeding by the
starrant and examples of Holy Scri∣pture;
or in resemblance to an Ar∣my
(as compared by <HI>Solomon</HI>) there
will be nothing left to the power of
the people either in way of Reforma∣mation
or Execution, till they be ve∣sted
and entrusted with some lawful
Power derived from him, whom God
hath placed in Authority over them.
And therefore though Idolatry be to
be destroyed, and to be destroyed by
all which have Power to do it, yet
must all those be furnish'd with a
lawful Power, or otherwise stand
guilty of as high a Crime, as that
<PB N="170" REF="99"/>
which they so zealously endeavour
to condemn in others. And if it be
urged, <HI>That the Sovereign forgetting
his Duty, the Subjects should remember
theirs;</HI> 'tis a lesson which was never
taught in the Book of God. For be∣side
the examples which we have in
demolishing the <HI>Brazen-Serpent</HI> and
the <HI>Altar of Bethel,</HI> not acted by
the Power of the People, but by the
Command of the Prince, I would
fain know where we shall find in the
whole course and current of Holy
Scriptures, that the common people in
and by their own Authority, removed
the <HI>High Places,</HI> and destroyed <HI>Ima∣ges,</HI>
or cut down the <HI>Groves,</HI> those
excellent Instruments of Superstition
and Idolatry; or that they did at∣tempt
any such thing till warranted
and commissionated by the Supreme
Powers? Where shall we find that
any of the seventy thousand persons,
which <HI>had not bowed the knee to Baal,</HI>
did go about to destroy that Idol?
or that <HI>Elijah</HI> or <HI>Elisha</HI> (two men as
<PB N="171" REF="99"/>
extraordinary for their Calling, as for
their Zeal and Courage) did excite
them to it? Where shall we find the
Primitive Christians, when living un∣der
the command of Heathenish Em∣perors,
busied in destroying Idols,
or defacing the Temples of those
gods, whom the <HI>Pagans</HI> worshipped,
though grown in those times unto
those infinite multitudes, that they
filled all places of the Empire, <HI>Et
vestra omnia implevimus,</HI> Cities, Ca∣stles,
Burroughs, your places of As∣sembly,
Camps, Tribes, Palaces, yea
the very Senate and common <HI>Forum,</HI>
as <HI>Tertullian</HI> pleads. No other Do∣ctrine
preach'd or heard of, till either
the new Gospel of <HI>Wickliff,</HI> or the
new Lights shining from <HI>Geneva.</HI></Q></P>
<P>These, with many more if it were
safe to insert them in these Papers,
were the Doctrines which this Reve∣rend
man taught when there was no
King in our <HI>English Israel.</HI> He did not
only rescue the actions of his Sove∣reigns
Life and Reign from those Ca∣Calumnies
<PB N="172" REF="100"/>
and Mistakes which were
obtruded on him by malicious or inob∣servant
Writers; but he took care that
what he writ should be beneficial to
Regal Government, and that those his
Country-men who had any share of
guilt in the unnatural Rebel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion might
be induced to a hearty Contrition and
Reformation. And this he did too in
those days of Libertinism and Danger,
when he could expect nothing for his
pains, but Death mingled with all the
ingredients of Cruelty and Torment.
Suffice it to acquaint the Reader that
Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> imparted to his judicious per∣usal
his <HI>Elenchus Motuum,</HI> (a secret of
that weight and importance that it
ought only to be lodg'd in so faithful
and loyal a Breast) upon which he
made many <HI>Considerations,</HI> that very
much tended to the honor of the King
and Church, as well as of that loyal
<HI>Physician</HI> and <HI>Historian.</HI> And which is
not unworthy of remark; in whatever
he Writ or Preach'd either before or af∣ther
the Murther of his Royal Master,
<PB N="173" REF="100"/>
he took care in asserting the Preroga∣tive
and Rights of the Crown, not to
intrench the least upon the Liberties
and Privileges of the People. For thus he
himself acquaints us, [<HI>Cert. Epist.</HI> 326.]
<Q>If any were faulty in this kind, <HI>viz.</HI> in
maintaining that all the Goods of the
Subject were at the Kings absolute
disposal, let them speak for themselves;
neither my Tongue nor Pen shall ever
be employed in their behalf: Certain
I am, that I am free enough from the
Accusation; my nearest kindred be∣ing
persons of too fair a Fortune to be
betrayed by one of their own Blood
to a loss of that property, which
they have by Law in their Estates.
And no less certain am I, that no flattery
or time-serving, no preaching up
of the Kings Prerogative, nor dero∣gating
from the property of the <HI>Eng∣lish
Subject,</HI> could be found in any of
my Sermons before his Majesty, had
they been sifted to the very <HI>Bran.</HI> In
confidence whereof, I offered the
<HI>Committee</HI> of the <HI>Courts of Iustice</HI> (be∣fore
<PB N="174" REF="101"/>
whom I was called on the Com∣plaint
of Mr. <HI>Pryn</HI>) to put into their
hands all the Sermons which I had
either Preach'd at <HI>Court</HI> of in <HI>West∣minster-Abby,</HI>
to the end they might
see how free and innocent I was from
broaching any such new Doctrines,
as might not be good <HI>Parliament-Proof,</HI>
whensoever they should come
to be examined.</Q></P>
<P>Nor was the courage of our <HI>Doctor</HI> for
the Church, less active and vigorous,
than for the King. For whenever its
<HI>Doctrine,</HI> of <HI>Discipline;</HI> its <HI>Ministry,</HI> or
<HI>Government;</HI> its <HI>Liturgy,</HI> or <HI>Ceremonies;</HI>
its <HI>Offices,</HI> or <HI>Revenues</HI> were assaulted
by Tongue or Pen, its enemies were in
a short space of time made acquainted
with their Malice or Mistakes. For he
encountred the Errors and Heresies,
the Schisms and Sacrileges, the Disloy∣alties
and Rebellions of the Age with
no less zeal than St. <HI>Paul</HI> did the gross
Idolatries and Superstitions of the
<HI>Athenians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="101"/>
The <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Church he de∣fended
against <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Calvinists.</HI>
What he did against the first will be a
sufficient vindication of his sincerity in
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion; a thing not
only doubted of, but called in question
in the Long Parliament; before whom
he made a large <HI>Protestation</HI> touching
his soundness in Religion and his averse∣ness
from <HI>Popery.</HI> The Form of his <HI>Pro∣testation</HI>
I never had communicated to
me; but whatever it was, he was then
freed by it from all suspicion of that
<HI>Crimination</HI> in the judgment of all so∣ber
men. He had before set himself
right in the opinion of the King and
the whole Court in the Sermons which
he Preach'd upon the Parable of the
<HI>Tares.</HI> For making the principal points
controverted between <HI>Vs</HI> and the <HI>Pa∣pists</HI>
the constant Arguments of his Dis∣courses
upon that Subject, his Audito∣ry
were so well satisfied about his inte∣grity
in <HI>Protestantism,</HI> that some of the
most judicious did not stick to say,
<HI>That Dr.</HI> Heylyn <HI>had in his Tare-Ser∣mons
<PB N="176" REF="102"/>
pulled up Popery by the Root and
subverted the Foundations of it:</HI> To
which it was replied by some bitter
spirits (whether with more unchari∣tableness
or imprudent zeal, is hard to
say) That <HI>the</HI> Archbishop <HI>might Print
and Dr.</HI> Heylyn <HI>might Preach what they
pleased against</HI> Popery, <HI>but they should
never believe them to be any thing the
less</HI> Papists <HI>for all that.</HI> A censure of a
very strange nature, and so little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣vouring
of Christianity, that it is hard
to parallel it by any instance, except
it be of the Age we now live in. And
so industrious has the Devil, the great
<HI>Calumniator and Accuser</HI> of Holy men,
been to propagate this Reproach, that
some persons, whose <HI>Tongues are their
own</HI> and will admit of <HI>no Lords over
them,</HI> have visited the very Grave of
this Reverend person and like <HI>Vultures</HI>
prey'd upon his body. Amongst whom,
the Author of that pestilent Pamphlet,
called <HI>An Appeal from the Country to
the City,</HI> lets flie at him
in these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 6.</NOTE> <HI>Dr.</HI> Heylyn
<PB N="177" REF="102"/>
<HI>has made more Papists by his Books than
Christians by his Sermons.</HI> And Dr.
<HI>Heylyn,</HI> though dead, does yet speak
for himself to the eternal confutation
of the <HI>Calumny,</HI> as well as shame of
the <HI>Calumniator.</HI> The present <HI>Dean</HI> of
St. <HI>Pauls</HI> has very gene∣rously
justified the <HI>Doctor</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">General Pre∣face to an An∣swer of seve∣ral Treatises.</NOTE>
against <HI>T. G.</HI> who by all
means would have
brought him over to his
Cause and Party in the Controversie
between them, about the Idolatry
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, quoting a pas∣sage
out of his fourth Sermon upon
the <HI>Tares,</HI> where he lays to the charge
of the <HI>Papists</HI> the most <HI>gross Idolatry,
greater than which, was never known
among the Gentiles.</HI> And indeed the
whole Volume of those Sermons is stu∣diously
contrived against <HI>Popery;</HI> and
put out on purpose in the last times of
Confusion, by our <HI>Doctor,</HI> to obstruct
the spreading of that Canker of Chri∣stianity.
And when he had preach'd
only the two first, some of his judici∣ous
<PB N="178" REF="103"/>
hearers did not stick to de∣clare,
That Dr. <HI>Heylyn had done more
in two Sermons for the Suppression of</HI>
Popery, <HI>than ever Dr.</HI> Pr. <HI>had done in
all his life.</HI></P>
<P>But that the Reader may be con∣vinc'd
about the <HI>Doctors</HI> sincerity in
<HI>Protestantism,</HI> let it be considered that
never any Writer upon the Apostles
<HI>Creed</HI> did more industriously expose
and strenuously confute the Errors of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, than he does in his
Treatise upon that Subject; which
was put out also at that time, when
he and the <HI>exauctorated</HI> Clergy (as he
calls them) had all the provocations of
want and scorn to have forsaken a per∣secuted
Church and embraced <HI>Popery.</HI>
He disproves their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Preface to <HI>Theo. Vet.</HI> p. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Tra∣ditions:</HI>
And as for their
<HI>Idolatry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theol. Vet.</HI> p. 27, 28. Edit. 1.</NOTE> he speaks in
these words, <HI>That altho
they publickly profess but
one Sovereign God, yet the poor Chri∣stians
in the Roman Church are taught
every where to place their confidence in
<PB N="179" REF="103"/>
more local Saints, than ever Heathen-Rome
did muster of its Topical gods.</HI>
—And how in <HI>a very little time</HI> Rome-<HI>Christian
came to have more Tutelary
Saints and Patrons (and those too of each
Sex) than ever Heathen</HI>-Rome <HI>should
gods, or goddesses.—Neither is this
any studied Calumny, but so clear a
Truth, that it was never yet gain-said
by their greatest Advocates: so much
hath Rome relapsed into her ancient
Gentilism,</HI> revived again so many of
her gods and goddesses, <HI>that both</HI> Jews
and Infidels <HI>may have cause to question,
whether she doth believe in one God alone,
or that he only is the Almighty Father,

<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">277.</NOTE> condemning <HI>Maldonate</HI>

to her. He<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">195.</NOTE> largely
disproves the monstrous
Paradox of <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> which
he shews was hammered in the brains
of capricious <HI>School-men,</HI>
<NOTE N="ib" PLACE="marg">269, 270, 294.</NOTE> and that the Sacri∣fice
of the <HI>Mass</HI> is a dan∣gerous
deceit and blas∣phemous
Fable affabulated to <HI>Transub∣stantiation</HI>
by the Popes of <HI>Rome;</HI> the
Rise and absurd consequences of which
Doctrine he at large illu∣strates.
He is content<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">292.</NOTE> to
be accounted a <HI>Heretick</HI>
by the <HI>Papists,</HI> because he will admit of
no more <HI>Mediators of Intercession</HI> than
Christ, who is the <HI>Media∣tor
of Redemption.</HI> He<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">294.</NOTE>
confutes the strange Posi∣tions
of the <HI>Trent-Council</HI> about the
<HI>Mass,</HI> shewing how absurd it is that a
<HI>poor Priest should have power to make his
Maker; and having made him with the
Breath of his Mouth, he should fall
down and Worship what himself had
made: That having worship'd him as
<PB N="183" REF="105"/>
God, he should presume to lay hands up∣on
him, and Offer him in Sacrifice as
soon as Worship'd; that his Oblation once
made is efficacious both to Quick and
Dead; to the Absent and the Present;
and that such as are present at it, may,
if they find their stomachs serve, devour
their God.</HI> He<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">304.</NOTE> attacks
the <HI>Papists</HI> in the <HI>Funda∣mental</HI>
of their Religion,
<HI>viz.</HI> That Christ must have the Pope
for his <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> to supply his place and
absence, and to govern and direct his
Church in Peace and
Unity; and he<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">384.</NOTE> again
re-assumes the Argument
and confutes all that <HI>Bellarmin</HI> and o∣thers
produce for it. But then the mis∣chief
is, he tells of those,
who would<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">305.</NOTE> <HI>impose up∣on
the Church as many pe∣tite
Popes as there are Parishes—by
means whereof they make Christs Body
more monstrous, than the Monster</HI> Hy∣dra,
<HI>not, to have seven Heads only, but
seven hundred thousand</HI>—He takes
<PB N="184" REF="106"/>
<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">332.</NOTE> <HI>Estius</HI> to task for ma∣king
Christ in his Exposi∣tion
of <HI>Mark</HI> 13. 32. the
Author of <HI>Equivocation.</HI>
He<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">359.</NOTE> confutes <HI>Harding</HI>
for asserting, that the <HI>proof of Christs
Deity depended not upon the Holy Scri∣ptures,
but the Tradition of the Church,
and the Authority of some subsequent
Councils confirmed by</HI> Popes; as if God
could not be God, unless the <HI>Pope</HI> al∣lowed
it. He vindicates
<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">361, 362.</NOTE> the <HI>Greek</HI> Church a∣gainst
the uncharitable∣ness
of the <HI>Roman,</HI> and
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">371, 372.</NOTE> the Authority and
Honor of the Scriptures
against the Blasphemies
that are fixed upon them by the <HI>Pa∣pists;</HI>
but then as luck would have it,
he speaks of some <HI>Reformers,</HI> who as∣sert
that <HI>Preaching</HI> viva voce <HI>is only
able to convert sinners, and that the
Word sermoniz'd, not written, is alone
the Food that nourishes to eternal life;</HI>
and he proves unanswerably how such
<PB N="185" REF="106"/>
men detract more from its perfection
and sufficiency than the <HI>Papists.</HI> He
condemns those who call <HI>Papists</HI> by the
name of <HI>Catholicks,</HI> professing that he
<HI>never gave that name to them either in
Writing or common Speech, as thinking
it a greater condemnation to our selves
than men are aware of—And that if
we once grant them to be</HI> Catholicks, <HI>we
thereby do conclude our
selves to be no</HI> Christians.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De not. Eccles. l. 4. c. 4.</NOTE>
Nay he proves out of
<HI>Bellarmin,</HI> how they are delighted with
the name of <HI>Papists,</HI> and that they have
no mind to be called <HI>Christians;</HI> the
name in most parts of <HI>Italy</HI> being
grown so despicable, that <HI>Fool</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stian</HI>
are become <HI>Synonymous.</HI> Since
then (says the <HI>Doctor</HI>) they have no
mind to be called <HI>Christians,</HI> no reason
to be called <HI>Catholicks,</HI> let us call them
as they are, by the name of <HI>Papists,</HI> con∣sidering
their dependence on the <HI>Popes</HI>
decisions for all points of Faith. But
then he tells of another <HI>Faction</HI> that
make as ill an use of the Title <HI>Holy,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="107"/>
as the <HI>Papists</HI> do of the name <HI>Catho∣lick;</HI>
that are holy in the sense of <HI>Co∣rah</HI>
and his Factious <HI>Complices,</HI> who
made all the Congregation <HI>holy</HI> and
all <HI>holy</HI> alike. He gives also an ex∣cellent
account of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and
<HI>Independent</HI> platforms,
and<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">386, 387.</NOTE> proves against
both of them, that the
Churches Government is
not <HI>Democratical,</HI> and against the <HI>Pa∣pists,</HI>
that 'tis not <HI>Monarchical,</HI> but in
the judgment of the purest Antiquity
<HI>Aristocratical.</HI> In a word,
he<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">397, 398.</NOTE> shews how both
the <HI>Eastern</HI> and <HI>Western</HI>
Churches opposed the
<HI>Popes Supremacy,</HI> forced <HI>Celibacy of
Priests, Transubstantiation, Half-Com∣munion,
Purgatory, Worshiping of Ima∣ges,</HI>
and <HI>Auricular Confession:</HI> Of which
last Doctrine, he at large
<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">457, 458.</NOTE> states the whole busi∣ness
about it from Bishop
<HI>Morton,</HI> shewing how it
ought to be <HI>free</HI> in regard of <HI>Conscience,</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="107"/>
and <HI>possible</HI> in regard of <HI>Performance.</HI>
But then withal he asserts the Efficacy
and Power of the <HI>Sacerdotal Absolu∣tion,</HI>
proving it not only <HI>Declarative</HI>
but <HI>Authoritative</HI> and
<HI>Iudicial;</HI> as also the<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">403, 404.</NOTE>
Right that every <HI>National</HI>
Church has to decree <HI>Rites and Cere∣monies</HI>
for the more orderly officiating
in Gods Publick Worship, and the pro∣curing
of a greater degree of Reverence
to the Holy Sacraments.</P>
<P>In the belief of these Doctrines, this
great Scholar lived and died: And
with what confidence can any one rake
in his Grave and asperse his Memory,
not only with things which he never
opined, but with those which his soul
ever abhorr'd? But, if there can be any
accession to the degrees of Bliss in the
other world, I doubt not but his Re∣wards
are advanced and grow more
massie with the persecutions which his
name suffers upon earth. Our Blessed
Saviour himself was not out of the
reach of malevolent tongues, when his
<PB N="188" REF="108"/>
Body was laid in the
Grave,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 27. 63.</NOTE> being then called
a <HI>Deceiver</HI> by his Mur∣therers.
And thrice welcome are those
aspersions and mis-constructions that
make us conformable to so glorious a
pattern. Spiteful and inconsiderate men
do ever judg rashly of things and per∣sons,
taking a great pleasure to assault
the Innocence and undermine the Re∣putations
of those that are more up∣right
and vertuous than themselves.</P>
<P>But against these things 'tis com∣monly
said, and as commonly belie∣ved,
that some persons, and those too
of the most illustrious Quality have
been perverted from the <HI>Protestant</HI>
Faith to <HI>Popery,</HI> by reading some of Dr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI>'s Books, and particularly his
<HI>Ecclesia Restaurata,</HI> or <HI>History of the
Reformation.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> in the
first Volume of his History upon the
same Subject, has done all he can to
confirm the world in the belief of that
injurious imputation: For after a short
commendation of our <HI>Doctors</HI> stile and
<PB N="189" REF="108"/>
method (it being usual with some men
slightly to praise those at first, whom
they design to lash more severely after∣ward)
he presumes to tell
his Reader,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI>'s Preface to the <HI>History of the Reformation,</HI> Vol. I.</NOTE> <HI>That either
Doctor</HI> Heylyn <HI>was very
ill informed, or very
much led by his Passions;
and he being wrought on
by most violent prejudices against some
that were concerned in that time, deli∣vers
many things in such a manner and
so strangely, that one would think that
he had been secretly set on to it by those
of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>tho I doubt not
he was a sincere Protestant, but violent∣ly
carried away by some particular con∣ceits.
In one thing he is not to be excu∣sed,
That he never vouch'd any Autho∣rity
for what he writ, which is not to be
forgiven any who write of Transactions
beyond their own time, and deliver new
things not known before. So that upon
what ground he wrote a great deal of his
Book, we can only conjecture; and many
in their ghesses are not apt to be very fa∣vourable
to him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="109"/>
This Objection containing many
particulars in it, will require as many
distinct Answers in the Vindication of
the <HI>Doctors</HI> Honor and Writings, and
more especially of his <HI>History of the
Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>And first, if it be true, that any
have embraced the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith by rea∣ding
of that Book, we may conclude
them very incompetent Judges in mat∣ters
of Religion, who will be prevailed
on to change it upon the perusal of one
single <HI>History;</HI> and especially in the
Controversies between <HI>VS</HI> and the <HI>Pa∣pists,</HI>
which do not so very much de∣pend
upon matters of Fact, or upon an
<HI>Historical</HI> Narration of what occur∣rences
happened in <HI>England,</HI> in the
Reigns of any of our preceding Prin∣ces;
but upon Doctrines of <HI>Faith, viz.</HI>
what we are to believe or dis-believe in
order to our pleasing of God in this
life, and our being eternally blessed
with him in the next. Altho <HI>Iunius</HI>
and others have by their reading of
Holy Writ found the efficacy of it up∣on
<PB N="191" REF="109"/>
their hearts, and from profligate
<HI>Atheists</HI> have become Gods faithful
Servants; yet the blessed Doctrine of
the Bible, has through the depravation
of mans Nature, had a quite contrary
efficacy upon other persons; being just
like wholsom meat which administers
health and vigor unto Atheletick and
sound Bodies, but infeebles nature and
feeds the diseases of those that are
sickly and distempered. Let the <HI>Hi∣story
of the Reformation</HI> be never so fa∣tal
to unwary and less intelligent Rea∣ders,
yet it was writ with an intent to
justifie the <HI>Reformation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. Ded.</NOTE>
and that upon such <HI>just
and solid Reasons as might
sufficiently endear it to all knowing men,</HI>
as its Author tells his Majesty. <HI>Bonae
res neminem scandalizant nisi malam
mentem,</HI> says one of the Antients.
Some men have such inveterate Disea∣ses,
that no Physick can do them good;
and some Stomachs are so foul, that
Antidotes are turned by them into poi∣son.
If any one was ever unsetled in
<PB N="192" REF="110"/>
<HI>Protestantism</HI> by reading of <HI>Ecclesia Re∣staurata,</HI>
it was only accidental; his
perversion being to be ascribed ei∣ther
to the ignorance or weakness of his
Judgment, or to the stubbornness of
his Will, or some other evil principle of
his Mind. It cannot proceed from any
intrinsick evil quality in that or any
other Book of Doctor <HI>Heylyns,</HI> which
abound with unanswerable Arguments
to establish the <HI>Discipline</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI>
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> against its
professed Enemies of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Geneva.</HI>
But our <HI>Doctors</HI> own words will be a
sufficient defence of him unto all equal
and unprejudic'd Judgments, <Q>In the
whole carriage of this work, I have as∣sumed
unto my self the freedom of a
just <HI>Historian;</HI> concealing nothing
out of Fear, nor speaking any thing
out of Favour; delivering nothing for
a Truth without good Authority;
but so delivering that Truth, as to
witness for me, that I am neither bias∣sed
by Love or Hatred, nor over∣swayed
by partiality and corrupt af∣fections,</Q>
<PB N="193" REF="110"/>
<Q>I know 'tis impossible in a
work of this nature to please all par∣ties,
tho I have made it my endea∣vour
to dissatisfie none, but those
that hate to be reformed; or other∣wise
are so tenaciously wedded to
their own opinion, that neither Rea∣son
nor Authority can divorce them
from it.</Q> In short, his love to Truth,
and veneration to the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
were the only motives that made
him undertake to write that <HI>History:</HI>
The one was the <HI>Mistris,</HI> which he ever
serv'd; and the other was the <HI>Mother,</HI>
whose Paps he had always suck'd, And
whoever dis-regards, or deviates from
either of those, may perhaps be offen∣ded
with some particular passages in
<HI>Ecclesia Restaurata.</HI></P>
<P>As for his <HI>never vouching Authority
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r what he writ, which is not to be for∣given
him;</HI> I hope he has met with a
more merciful Judg in another world,
than it seems Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> is in this. But
who is to pardon Dr. <HI>B.</HI> for accusing
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> of <HI>violent prejudices</HI> against
<PB N="194" REF="111"/>
persons, of writing things so <HI>strangely,</HI>
as if he had been a <HI>Factor</HI> for the <HI>Pa∣pists,</HI>
and yet not specifying one parti∣cular
Instance, wherein he was thus
partial and perfidious. He began the
writing of that History in <HI>September</HI>
1638, communicating his design to
Archbishop <HI>Laud,</HI> from who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he re∣ceived
all imaginable encouragement.
And what benefit would any Reader
receive to have quoted to him the pa∣ges
of <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> Acts of <HI>Parliament,</HI>
Registers of <HI>Convocation,</HI> old <HI>Records</HI>
and <HI>Charters,</HI> orders of <HI>Council-Table,</HI>
or other of those rare pieces in the
<HI>Cottonian</HI> Library, which were made
use of in that elaborate <HI>History.</HI> Had
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Heylyn</HI> borrowed his materials out
of Vulgar or Printed Authors, he ought
then to have vouch'd particular Au∣thorities
for what he writ, but ma∣king
use of those which few Scholars
either could or had perused, it had been
the part of a <HI>Pedant,</HI> not of an <HI>Historian,</HI>
to have been exact and parti∣cular
in his Quotations. Not to men∣tion
<PB N="195" REF="111"/>
either <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latine Historians.</HI>
Does not Dr. <HI>B.</HI> esteem the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s
<HI>History</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. to contain as com∣plete
and judicious an account of the
Affairs of that Princes Reign, as any
thing of that nature, that is extant in
<HI>English</HI> Story? But the <HI>Margent</HI> of
that Book is not stust with many
more Quotations, than the <HI>Doctors Ec∣clesia
Restaurata.</HI> And yet the Lord <HI>Ba∣con
writ of Transactions beyond his own
time,</HI> and lived as far distant from the
Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. as Dr. <HI>Hey∣lyn</HI>
did from King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who laid
the first Foundation of our <HI>Reformation.</HI>
For my own part I cannot with the
most diligent search find out any passa∣ges
in <HI>Ecclesia Restaurata,</HI> which evert
the great Rule that ought to be obser∣ved
by all <HI>Historians,</HI> viz. <HI>Ne quid fal∣se
audeant,</HI> to commit nothing unto
Writing which they know to be false,
or cannot justifie to be true. <HI>History</HI>
is the Record of time, by which the
Revolutions of Providence are trans∣mitted
from one Age unto another. And
<PB N="196" REF="112"/>
if it can be proved that Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> has
either suborned <HI>Witnesses,</HI> falsified <HI>Re∣cords,</HI>
or so wrested <HI>Evidence,</HI> that
posterity cannot make a certain judg∣ment
of those Transactions, of which
he undertook to inform his Country∣men,
then it must be confessed that he
was led by Passion more than Judg∣ment,
and by <HI>violent prejudices</HI> more
than the substantial evidences of
Truth.</P>
<P>And yet if all this were made out,
'tis no more than what may be laid at
the door of that Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. D. <HI>Ham. p.</HI> 29, 30.</NOTE> who not ma∣ny
years since writ the
<HI>History of Duke</HI> Hamilton;
where are reported the
most abominable Scandals, broach'd by
the malicious <HI>Covenanteers</HI> against the
<HI>Hierarchy</HI> of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Church. And
the <HI>Historian,</HI> without the least con∣tradiction
or confutation, permits them
to pass for infallible Truths, that so
Posterity as well as the present preju∣diced
Age might be leavened with an
implacable enmity and hatred against
<PB N="197" REF="112"/>
the whole Order of Bishops. And al∣tho
the <HI>Hamiltons</HI> were the old inve∣terate
enemies of the <HI>Stuarts;</HI> and the
<HI>Duke,</HI> of whom that large <HI>History</HI> is
compiled, was an enemy as treacherous
to K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. as any that ever ap∣peared
against him in open Arms,
drawing the <HI>Scots</HI> in the <HI>English</HI>
Court to be his Dependents; aliena∣ting
their Affections from the King his
Master. Tho wise men of both Nations
thought that the first Tumult at <HI>Edin∣borough</HI>
was raised by his Instruments,
and the Combustions that ensued were
secretly fomented by him: Tho when
he was <HI>High Commissioner,</HI> he drew the
King from one Condescention to ano∣ther
in behalf of the <HI>Covenanteers,</HI> till
he had little else left to give but his
Crown and Life: Tho he drew him
first to suspend and then to suppress the
<HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Canons</HI> made for the use
of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Church, and to abrogate
the five <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Perth,</HI> procured
with so much difficulty by K. <HI>Iames,</HI>
and confirmed by <HI>Parliament:</HI> Tho he
<PB N="198" REF="113"/>
authorized the Covenant with some
few alterations in it, and generally im∣posed
it on that Kingdom: Tho he
yielded to the calling of the Assembly,
and was assured by that means, that the
Bishops by the Majority of their Ene∣mies
Voices should be Censured and
Excommunicated; that Episcopacy
should be abolished, and all the Regu∣lar
Clergy exposed to Ruine: Tho he
got to himself so strong a Party in the
Kingdom, that the King stood but for a
Party in the Calculation: Tho when
he had Command over a considerable
part of the Royal Navy in the <HI>Frith</HI>
at <HI>Edinburough,</HI> he made good that
saying of the <HI>Scots, That the Son of so
good a Mother</HI> (being a most rigid <HI>Cove∣nanter)
could do them no hurt,</HI> by loiter∣ing
about on purpose till he heatd that
the Treaty of <HI>Pacification</HI> was begun
at <HI>Barwick,</HI> whither he came in <HI>Post∣hast,</HI>
pretending to disturb that busi∣ness,
when he knew it would be con∣cluded
before he came thither: Tho
he was guilty of the vilest Treachery
<PB N="199" REF="113"/>
to the Best of Princes, and the Best of
Subjects, <HI>viz. Charles</HI> I. and the Mar∣quess
of <HI>Montross,</HI> who returning out
of <HI>France,</HI> and designing to put him∣self
into the Kings Service, made his
way to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who (knowing the
gallantry of the man, and fearing a
Competitor in his Majesti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Favour)
told <HI>Montross</HI> on the one hand, That
the King slighted the <HI>Scottish</HI> Nation,
that he designed to reduce it unto a
Province, and that he would no lon∣ger
continue in the Court were it not
for some services that he was engaged
to do for his Country: And on the o∣ther
hand told the King, That <HI>Montross</HI>
was so popular and powerful among
the <HI>Scots,</HI> that he would embroil the
Affairs, and endanger the Interest of
his Majesty in that Kingdom; which
suggestions made the King take little
notice of him, and the Martyred <HI>Heroe</HI>
was confirmed in the belief of what
<HI>Hamilton</HI> had secretly whispered to
him; which caused him to go to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and there to list himself with the
<PB N="200" REF="114"/>
Male-contents of that Kingdom, whose
concerns he espoused till he saw his own
Error, and <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Treachery: Tho
D. <HI>Hamilton</HI> was the man that prevai∣led
with the King to pass that Act for
continuation of the Parliament during
the pleasure of the Two Houses, and
boasted how he had got a perpetual
Parliament for the <HI>English,</HI> and would
do the like for the <HI>Scots</HI> too, and con∣trary
to the wishes of all good men,
prevailed with the King to Dissolve
that Parliament which was immedi∣ately
precedent, playing with both
hands at once; pulling with one hand
back the Commons from all Compli∣ance
with the King, and thrusting on
the King with the other hand to Dis∣solve
the Parliament: In fine (for the
repetition of these things is not very
delighting) Tho this D. <HI>Hamilton</HI> did
in the opinion of very many wise men
aim at nothing less than the Crown of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and had so courted the Com∣mon
Soldiers, raised for the Service of
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and obliged their Com∣manders,
<PB N="201" REF="114"/>
that <HI>David Ramsey</HI> openly
began an health to King <HI>Iames</HI> the
Seventh; yet all these with many more
particulars are either quite smothered,
or so painted over by Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> that
the Volume he has writ upon <HI>Hamil∣ton</HI>
may rather be called an <HI>Apology,</HI> or
a <HI>Panegyrick</HI> than a <HI>History.</HI> But Dr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI> had the courage to acquaint the
world with these harsh Truths in the
Life of the Archbishop, and in the
<HI>Observations</HI> that he has writ upon Mr.
<HI>L'Estrange</HI>'s <HI>History</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.
And there was no other way to be re∣venged
on him, than to traduce his
Labours, and blast his Memory, as if
he had been <HI>secretly set on to write by
those of the Church of</HI> Rome. A Calum∣ny
so improbable, that 'tis confuted
in the very Preface to
<HI>Ecclesia Restaurata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 6.</NOTE> where
he tells how the <HI>Owners
of the</HI> Abby-Lands <HI>had all the reason
in the world to maintain that Right,
which by the known Laws of the Land
had been vested in them.—And that the</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="115"/>
Exchanges, Grants and Sales <HI>of the</HI> Mo∣nasteries
and Religious Houses <HI>were
passed and confirmed by the Kings</HI> Let∣ters-Patents
<HI>under the</HI> Great Seal of
<HI>England in due form of Law, which gave
unto the</HI> Patentees <HI>as good a Title as the
Law could make them; and that Pope</HI>
Julius <HI>the Second in</HI> Queen Maries
<HI>Reign confirmed all those Lands by his</HI>
Decree <HI>to the present Occupants, of
which they stood possessed</HI> (justo titulo)
<HI>by a lawful Title.</HI> But the Doctors Ob∣servation
is verified in himself, <HI>viz.
That 'Tis the Faction a man joyns with,
not the Life or Principles of the man
himself that makes him a good or a bad
man;</HI> And I will add a learned or good
Writer. He did not write Books, or
Preach Sermons, as anciently <HI>Poets</HI> did
<HI>Comedies,</HI> of whom <HI>Terence</HI> tells us,
<Q><L>Poeta cum primum animum ad scriben∣dum appulit,</L>
<L>Id sibi negotii credidit solum dari,</L>
<L>Populo ut placerent, quas fecissit fabulas.</L></Q></P>
<PB N="203" REF="115"/>
<P>Thus Englished by Dr. Heylyn.</P>
<L>Thus Poets when their mind they first apply,</L>
<L>In looser Verse to frame a Comedy.</L>
<L>Think there is nothing more for them to do</L>
<L>Than please the people whom they speak
unto.</L>
<P>But this Reverend man was of no
crouching temper to popular Factions,
or Opinions, And whoever they are
that oppose those, will be charged
with Railing and Reviling, as well as
with Falsities and Mistakes, tho they
use the most unaffected propriety of
words to represent the conceptions of
their minds, in giving an account of
things in their proper and due circum∣stances.
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> had too much in
him of a <HI>Gentleman</HI> and a <HI>Scholar</HI> to
use any unseemly expressions in his
Writings, to render either Persons,
Opinions, or Actions odious. If he
<PB N="204" REF="116"/>
found them so, he ought so to repre∣sent
them, or else he would not have
acquitted himself like an <HI>Historian, i. e.</HI>
faithful to the just interests of Truth.
Had he but employed his Pen to have
written one half of those things against
the King and Church of <HI>England,</HI>
which he writ for them, he would
have been accounted by very many
persons (I will not say by Dr. B.) the
greatest <HI>Scholar,</HI> the greatest <HI>Protestant,</HI>
the most faithful <HI>Historian,</HI> or in their
own phrase, <HI>the most precious man</HI> that
ever yet breath'd in this Nation. But
he had the good luck to be a Scholar,
and better luck to employ his Learn∣ing
like an honest man and a good
Christian, in the defence of a Righte∣ous
and pious King; of an Apostoli∣cal
and true Church; of a Venerable
and Learned Clergy: And this drew
upon him all the <HI>odium</HI> and malice that
two opposite Factions, <HI>Papist</HI> and <HI>Sectary</HI>
could heap upon him.</P>
<P>Had he writ only against the first,
his name had received no more distur∣bance
<PB N="205" REF="116"/>
from men upon earth, than his
Soul does amongst its blessed associates
in Heaven. But diving into unbeaten
paths, in his Theological Studies, he
gives an account of the first entrance
of the <HI>Calvinian</HI> Tenets
into this Kingdom, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exam. Hist. 162.</NOTE>
<Q>How the controversies
about Grace, Predestination, &amp;c. had

the <HI>Dominicans</HI> grounding their opini∣on

many of our exiled Di∣vines
returning from

places, where <HI>Calvins</HI> Dictates were
received as celestial Oracles, brought
with them his opinions in the points
<HI>of Predestination, Grace</HI> and <HI>Perseve∣rance:</HI>
which being dispersed and
scattered over all the Church by <HI>Cal∣vins</HI>
authority and the diligence of
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> party (then busie in
advancing their Holy Discipline)
they came to be received for the on∣ly
true and orthodox Doctrine, and
<PB N="207" REF="117"/>
were so publickly maintained in the
Schools of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> till Dr. <HI>Peter
Baroe, Professor</HI> for the Lady <HI>Marga∣ret</HI>
in that University, revived the
<HI>Melancthonian</HI> way in his publick Le∣ctures,
and by his great Learning and
Arguments had drawn many others
to the same persuasions.</Q></P>
<P>From which words it appears what
little shew of reason there is to call
those Divines <HI>Arminians,</HI> who are of a
different judgment from Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> in
the points aforesaid. For first, The
<HI>Arminians</HI> are rather a Branch of the
Sect of <HI>Calvin;</HI> to whose Discipline
in all particulars they conform them∣selves,
and to this Doctrines in most,
differing from him only in <HI>Predestina∣tion</HI>
and the Points subordinate; but
managing those differences with a far
better temper than their <HI>Opposites,</HI> as
may be seen at large in Mr. <HI>Hales</HI>'s
Letters. And secondly,
<Q><HI>Arminius</HI></Q> (as our <HI>Doctor</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cert. Epist. 22.</NOTE>
Tells us) <Q>was too much
a <HI>puisne,</HI> of too late standing in the
<PB N="208" REF="118"/>
world, to be accounted the first
<HI>Broacher</HI> of those <HI>Doctrinal</HI> Points,
which have such warrant from the
Scriptures, and were so generally
held by the ancient Fathers both
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine,</HI> till St. <HI>Austins</HI> time;
defended since that time by the <HI>Ie∣suites</HI>
and <HI>Franciscans</HI> in the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> by all the <HI>Melancthonian</HI>
Divines among the <HI>Lutherans;</HI> by
<HI>Castalio</HI> in <HI>Geneva</HI> it self; by Bishop
<HI>Latimer</HI> and Bishop <HI>Hooper</HI> in the
time of K. <HI>Edward</HI> VI; by some of
our <HI>Confessors</HI> in Prison in the days
of Qu. <HI>Mary:</HI> by Bishop <HI>Harsnet</HI> in
the Pulpit; by Dr. <HI>Peter Baroe</HI> in the
Schools in the Reign of Qu. <HI>Elizabeth;</HI>
by <HI>Hardem Bergius</HI> the first Reformer
of the Church and City of <HI>Emden;</HI>

in the Province of <HI>Friezeland,</HI>
before the name of <HI>Iacob van Har∣mine</HI>
was heard of in the world.</Q></P>
<P>And if it be objected that the whole
stream of <HI>Protestant</HI> Divines, who were
famous either for Piety or Learning
embraced the <HI>Calvinian</HI> Doctrines; to
this also the <HI>Doctor</HI> gives a satisfactory
answer in many places of his learned
Writings. The Reader
may please to consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cert. Epist. 173.</NOTE>
1. That this being granted to be a
truth, we are rather to look upon it
as an infelicity which befel the Church,
than as an argument that she concurr'd
with those Divines in all points of
judgment. That which was most aimed
at immediately after the <HI>Reformation,</HI>
and for a long time after, in prefer∣ring
men to the highest dignities of the
Church, and chief places in the Uni∣versities,
was their zeal against <HI>Popery,</HI>
and such a sufficiency of learning as
might enable him to defend those
Points, on which our separation from
the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was to be main∣tained,
<PB N="210" REF="119"/>
and the Queens Interest most
preserved. The Popes <HI>Supermacy,</HI> the
<HI>Mass,</HI> with all the Points and Nicities
which depended on it, <HI>Iustification</HI> by
Faith, <HI>Marriage</HI> of <HI>Priests, Purgatory,</HI>
the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Civil</HI> Magistrate,
were the Points most agitated: And
whoever appeared right in those, and
withal declared himself against the
corruptions of that Church in point of
Manners, was seldom or never looked
into for his other Opinions, until the
Church began to find the sad conse∣quences
of it in such a general tenden∣cy
to Innovation both in <HI>Doctrine</HI> and
<HI>Discipline,</HI> as could not easily be re∣dress'd.
2. In answer to the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re-men∣tioned
objection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. 153.</NOTE> It is re∣corded
in St. <HI>Marks</HI> Gospel,
<HI>cap.</HI> 8. that the blind
man whom our Saviour restored to
sight at <HI>Bethsaida,</HI> at the first opening
of his eyes <HI>saw men as Trees walking,</HI>
ver. 24. i. e. walking as Trees; <HI>quasi
dicat homines quos ambulantes video,
non homines sed arbores mihi videren∣tur,</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="119"/>
as we read in <HI>Maldonate.</HI> By
which words, the blind man declared
(saith he) <HI>se qauidem videre aliquid, cum
nihil antè videret, imperfectè tamen vi∣dere,
cum inter homines &amp; arbores di∣stinguere
non posset.</HI> More briefly <HI>Esti∣us</HI>
upon the place, <HI>Nondum ita clarè &amp;
perfectè video, ut discernere possim inter
homines &amp; arbores.</HI> I discern somewhat,
said the poor man, but so imperfectly,
that I am not able to distinguish be∣tween
Trees and Men. Such an imper∣fect
sight as this the Lord gave many
times to those whom he recovered out
of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> darkness, who not
being able to discern all Divine Truths
at the first opening of the eyes of their
understandings, were not to be a Rule
and Precedent to those that followed
and lived in clearer times. and under a
brighter Beam of Illumination than
others did.</P>
<P>What grounds were laid down by
this excellent person for Unity and
Charity in the Worship of God, and
in the Doctrine and Government of
<PB N="212" REF="120"/>
the Church, may be seen in these
words to Mr. <HI>Baxter;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cert. Epist. 57.</NOTE>
<Q>Unity and Charity in
the ancient simplicity of Doctrine,
Worship, and Government, no man
likes better than my self; bring but
the same affections with you, and the
wide Breach that is between us (in
some of the Causes which we manage
on either side) will be suddenly clo∣sed:
but then you must be sure to
stand to the word <HI>Ancient</HI> also, and
not keep your self to <HI>simplicity</HI> on∣ly.
If <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> will con∣tent
you in the ancient Doctrine, in
the <HI>simplicity</HI> thereof without sub∣sepuent
mixtures of the Church, I
know no Doctrine in the Church
more pure and <HI>Ancient,</HI> than that
which is publickly held forth by the
Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Book of
<HI>Articles,</HI> the <HI>Homilies,</HI> and the <HI>Ca∣techism</HI>
authorized by Law, of which
I may safely affirm as St. <HI>Austin</HI> does
in his Book <HI>Ad Marcelinum, His qui
contradicit, aut a Christi fide alienus
<PB N="213" REF="120"/>
est, aut est Haereticus, i. e.</HI> He must
either be an In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idel or an Heretick
who assents not to them, If <HI>Vnity</HI>
and <HI>Charity</HI> in the <HI>simplicity</HI> of Wor∣ship
be the thing you aim at, you
must not give every man the liberty
of worshiping in what Form he plea∣seth,
which destroys all <HI>Vnity;</HI>
nor Cursing many times instead of
Praying, which destroys all <HI>Charity.</HI>
The ancient and most simple way of
Worship in the church of God was
by regular Forms prescribed for the
publick use of Gods people in the
Congregations, and not by unpreme∣ditated
undigested Prayers, which
every man makes unto himself, as his
fancy shall lead him. And if set <HI>Forms</HI>
of Worship are to be retained, you
will not easily meet with any, which
hath more in it of the ancient <HI>sim∣plicity</HI>
of the Primitive Times, than
the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy. And if ancient
<HI>simplicity</HI> of Government be the point
you drive at, what Government can
you find more pure or <HI>Ancient</HI> than
<PB N="214" REF="121"/>
that of <HI>Bishops;</HI> of which you have
this Character in the <HI>Petition</HI> of the
County of <HI>Rutland,</HI> where it is said
to be, That Government which the
Apostles left the Church in; that the
Three Ages of Martyrs were gover∣ned
by; that the thirteen Ages since
have always gloried in; (by their Suc∣cession
of Bishops from the Apostles,
proving themselves Members of the
<HI>Catholick</HI> and <HI>Apostolick</HI> Church) that
our Laws have established; that so
many Kings and Parliaments have
protected; into which we were Ba∣ptized;
as certainly <HI>Apostolical</HI> as the
Lords day; as the distinction of
Books were written by such <HI>Evange∣lists</HI>
and <HI>Apostles,</HI> as the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecrati∣on
of the <HI>Eucharist</HI> by <HI>Presbyters,</HI>
&amp;c. An ample commendation of E∣piscopal
Government, but such as ex∣ceeds
not the bounds of Truth or
Modesty. Stand to these grounds for
keeping <HI>Vnity</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> in the an∣cient
<HI>simplicity</HI> of <HI>Doctrine, Worship</HI>
and <HI>Government</HI> in the Church of
<PB N="215" REF="121"/>
God, and you shall see how chear∣fully
the Regal and Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atical Par∣ty
will joyn hands with you, and
embrace you with most dear affecti∣ons.</Q>
But you tell me, That <HI>if I will
have men in peace as Brethren, our</HI>
Union <HI>must be Law, or Ceremonies, or
indifferent Forms.</HI> <Q>This is a pretty
Speculation, but such as would not
pass for practicable in any well-go∣verned
Commonwealth, unless it be
in the old <HI>Vtopia,</HI> the new <HI>Atlantis,</HI>
or the last discovered <HI>Oceana.</HI> For how
can men possibly live in peace as Bre∣thren,
where there is no Law to li∣mit
their desires, or direct their acti∣ons?
Take away Law, and every
man will be a Law unto himself, and
<HI>do whatsoever seems best in his own
eyes</HI> without controul: then Lust
will be a Law for one; Fellony for
another; Perjury shall be held no
Crime; nor shall any Treason or Re∣bellion
receive their punishments; for
<HI>where there is no Law, there can be no
Transgression:</HI> and where there is no
<PB N="216" REF="122"/>
Transgression, there can be no pu∣nishment;
punishments being only
due for the breach of Laws. Thus is
it also in the Worship of God; which
by the Hedg of <HI>Ceremonies</HI> is preser∣ved
from lying open to all prophane∣ness;
and by <HI>Set-Forms</HI> (be they as
indifferent as they will) is kept from
breaking out into open confusion. St.
<HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <HI>God is the God of
Order, not of Confusion in the Churches.</HI>
If therefore we desire to avoid Confu∣sion,
let us keep some Order; and if
we would keep Order, we must have
some Forms; it being impossible that
men should live in peace as Brethren
in the house of God, where we do
not find both. <HI>David</HI> has told us
in the <HI>Psalms,</HI> that <HI>Ierusalem</HI> is like
a City which is at <HI>Vnity</HI> with it self.
And in <HI>Ierusalem</HI> there were not on∣ly
solemn Sacrifices, <HI>Set-Forms</HI> of
Blessing, and some significant <HI>Ceremo∣nies</HI>
prescribed by God; but <HI>Musi∣cal</HI>
Instruments and <HI>Singers,</HI> and <HI>Lin∣nen
Vestures</HI> for those <HI>Singers,</HI> and
<PB N="217" REF="122"/>
certain <HI>Hymns</HI> and several <HI>Times</HI> and
<HI>Places</HI> for them ordained by <HI>David.</HI>
Had every Ward in that City, and
every Street in that Ward, and every
Family in that Street, and perhaps
every Person in that Family used his
own way in Worshiping the Lord his
God, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> could not long have
kept the name of a <HI>City,</HI> much less
the honor of being that <HI>City which
was at Vnity in it self</HI>—When there∣fore
the Apostle gives us this good
counsel, that we endeavour to <HI>keep
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace,</HI> he seems to intimate that there
can be no <HI>Vnity,</HI> where there is no
Peace; and that <HI>Peace</HI> cannot be pre∣served
without some <HI>Bond.</HI> If you
destroy all <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and subvert all
<HI>Forms,</HI> you must break the <HI>Bond;</HI>
and if the Bond be broken, you must
break the <HI>Peace;</HI> and if you break
the Peace, what becomes of the <HI>Vni∣ty?</HI>
So that it is but the dream of a
dry Summer (as the saying is) to
think that without <HI>Law,</HI> or <HI>Forms,</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="123"/>
or <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> men may live peace∣ably
together as becomes Brethren,
though they profess one Faith, ac∣knowledg
one Lord, receive one Ba∣ptism,
and be Sons of one Father
which is in Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus surveyed some particu∣lars
pertaining to the Doctrine and Ce∣remonies
of the Church, proeced we
next to take a short view of some
things delivered by this right learned
man concerning the <HI>Convocation;</HI>
which in ancient times
was <Q>part of the Parlia∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exam. Hist 126.</NOTE>
there being a
Clause in every Letter of Summons
by which the Bishops were required
to attend in Parliament, that they
should warn the Clergy of their re∣spective
Dioceses, some in their Per∣sons,
and others by their <HI>Procura∣tors</HI>
to attend there also▪ But this
has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n so long unpractis'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that we
find no foot-steps of it since the Par∣liaments
in the time of King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
the Second. It is true indeed
<PB N="219" REF="123"/>
that in the 8th. year of <HI>Henry</HI> VI.
there passed a Statute, by which it
was enacted,</Q> <HI>That all the Clergy
which should be called thenceforth to
the Convocation by the Kings Writ, to∣gether
with their Servants and Families,
should for ever after fully use and enjoy
such liberty and immunity in coming,
tarrying and returning, as the Great men
and Commonalty of the Realm of</HI> Eng∣land
<HI>called or to be called to the Kings
Parliament have used, or ought to have
or enjoy.</HI> <Q>Which though it makes
the <HI>Convocation</HI> equal to the Parlia∣ment
as to the freedom of their Per∣sons;
yet cannot it from hence be
reckoned or reputed for a part there∣of.</Q></P>
<P>And as it is now no part of the Par∣liament,
so neither has it any necessary
dependence upon that Honourable
Council and Assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observat. on the History of the Reign of K. <HI>Charles,</HI> 220.</NOTE> ei∣ther
in the Calling or
Dissolving of it, or in the
Confirmation or Autho∣rizing
of the Acts thereof, but only
<PB N="220" REF="124"/>
in the King himself; and not upon the
Kings sitting in the Court of Parlia∣ment,
but in his Palace or Court-Royal
where ever it be. And this appears
both by the Statute made in the 26th.
of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and the constant pra∣ctice
ever since. Indeed since the 25th.
year of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. no <HI>Convocation</HI> is
to assemble, but as it is Convocated and
Convened by the Kings Writ? for in
the Year 1532. the Clergy made their
Acknowledgment and Submission in
their <HI>Convocation</HI> to that mighty and
great Monarch; which <HI>Submission</HI>
passed into a <HI>Statute</HI> the very next year
following. But this does not hinder,
but that their Acts and Constitutions
ratified by Royal Assent, are of force to
bind the Subject to submit and con∣form
to them. For before the <HI>Statute</HI>
of <HI>Proemunire,</HI> and the <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>Sub∣mission,
Convocations</HI> made <HI>Canons</HI> that
were binding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exam. Hist. 97.</NOTE> altho
none other than <HI>Synodical</HI>
Authority did confirm
the same. And certainly they must
<PB N="221" REF="124"/>
have the same power; when the Kings
Authority signified in his Royal As∣sent
is added to them. They also gave
away the money of the Clergy, by
whom they were chosen, even as the
Commons in Parliament gave the mo∣ney
of the Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obs. 196.</NOTE> Towns
and Countries, for which
they served. For in chu∣sing
the Clerks for <HI>Convocation,</HI> there is
an Instrument drawn up and sealed by
the Clergy, in which they bind them∣selves
to the Arch-Deacons of their
several Dioceses upon the pain of for∣feiting
all their Lands and Goods, <HI>Se
ratum, gratum &amp; acceptum habere, quic∣quid
Dicti Procuratores sui dixerint, fe∣cerint
vel constituerint, i. e.</HI> to allow,
stand and perform whatsoever their
said Clerks shall say, do, or condescend
unto on their behalf. Nor is this a spe∣culative
Authority only and not redu∣cible
unto practice, but precedented in
Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time. For in the
year 1585. the <HI>Convocation</HI> having gi∣ven
one <HI>Subsidy</HI> confirmed by Parlia∣ment,
<PB N="222" REF="125"/>
and finding that they had not
done sufficiently for the Queens occa∣sions,
did after add a <HI>Benevolence</HI> or
<HI>Aid</HI> of two shillings in the pound to be
levied upon all the Clergy; and to be
levied by such <HI>Synodical</HI> Acts and Con∣stitutions,
as they digested for that
purpose, without having any recourse
to the Parliament for it.</P>
<P>But against these things it was ob∣jected
in the Long Parliament of King
<HI>Charles</HI> I, That the Clergy had no
power to make <HI>Canons</HI> without com∣mon
consent in Parliament, because
<HI>in the</HI> Saxon <HI>times, Laws and Consti∣tutions
Ecclesiastical had the Confirma∣tion
of Peers, and sometimes of the peo∣ple,
unto which great Councils our
Parliaments do succeed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exam. Hist. 237.</NOTE>
<Q>Which argumeut (says
our Reverend <HI>Doctor</HI>) if
it be of force to prove, that the Cler∣gy
can make no <HI>Canons</HI> without con∣sent
of the Peers and People in Par∣liament,
it must prove also that the
Peers and People can make no <HI>Sta∣tutes</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="125"/>
without consent of the Clergy
in their <HI>Convocation.</HI> My reason is,
because such Councils in time of the
<HI>Saxons</HI> were mixt Assemblies, con∣sisting
as well of <HI>Laicks</HI> as <HI>Ecclesia∣sticks?</HI>
and the matters there conclu∣ded
on of a mixt nature also; <HI>Laws</HI>
being passed as commonly in them in
order to the good Governance of the
Commonwealth, as <HI>Canons</HI> for the
regulating such things as concerned
Religion. And these great Councils
of the <HI>Saxons</HI> being divided into
two parts in the times ensuing, their
Clergy did their work by themselves
without any Confirmation of the
King or Parliament, till the <HI>Submis∣sion</HI>
of the Clergy to King <HI>Henry</HI>
VIII. And if Parliaments did succeed
in the place of those great Councils,
it was because that anciently the Pro∣curators
of the Clergy, not the Bi∣shops
only had their place in Parlia∣ment,
tho neither <HI>Peers</HI> nor <HI>People</HI>
voted in the <HI>Convocations.</HI> Which be∣ing
so, it is not much to be admired
<PB N="224" REF="126"/>
that the <HI>Commons</HI> repined about the
disuse of the general making of
Church-Laws, as they did in the be∣ginning
of the Long Parliament, when
they voted</Q> <HI>the proceedings of the
Clergy to be prejudicial and destructive
to the Fundamental Liberties and Pri∣viledges
of the Subject.</HI> <Q>For besides
that this repining at the proceedings
of any Superiour Court does not
make its <HI>Acts</HI> illegal, there is a new
memorable passage in the Parliament
of the 51. of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. which will
clear this matter, which in brief is
this: The <HI>Commons</HI> finding them∣selves
agrieved as well with certain
<HI>Constitutions</HI> made by the Clergy in
their <HI>Synods,</HI> as with some <HI>Laws</HI> or
<HI>Ordinances</HI> which were lately passed,
more to the advantage of the Clergy
than the common People, put in a
Bill to this effect,</Q> <HI>viz. That no Act or
Ordinance should from thenceforth be
made or granted on the Petition of the
said Clergy without consent of the Com∣mons:
and that the said Commons should
<PB N="225" REF="126"/>
not be bound in times to come by any
Constitutions made by the Clergy of this
Realm for their own advantage, to which
the Commons of this Realm had not gi∣ven
consent.</HI> <Q>The reason of which is
this,</Q> and 'tis worth the marking
<HI>Car eux ne veulent estre obligez anul de
vos Estatuz ne ordinances faits sanz leur
Assent,</HI> i. e. <HI>because the Clergy did not
think themselves bound</HI> (as indeed they
were not in those times) <HI>by any Statute,
Act, or Ordinance made without their
Assent in the Court of Parliament.</HI>
<Q>And besides these precedents already
mentioned, there is another memo∣rable
<HI>Convocation</HI> in the 4th. and 5th.
years of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Ma∣ry;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduct. un∣to <HI>Exam. Hist.</HI></NOTE>
in which the Cler∣gy
taking notice of an
Act of Parliament then newly pas∣sed,
by which the Subjects of the
<HI>Temporalty,</HI> having Lands in the
yearly value of five pounds and up∣wards,
were charged with finding
Horse and Armor according to the
proportion of their yearly Revenues
<PB N="226" REF="127"/>
and Possessions, did by their sole
Authority in the <HI>Convocation,</HI> impose
upon themselves and the rest of the
Clergy of this Land, the finding of
a like number of Horses, Armor
and other necessaries for the War,
according to their yearly Income,
proportion for proportion, and rate
for rate, as by that <HI>Statute</HI> hath been
laid on the Temporal Subjects. And
this they did by their own sole Au∣thority,
as was before said; order∣ing
the same to be levied on all such
as were refractory, by <HI>Sequestration,
Deprivation, Suspension, Excommuni∣cation,</HI>
without relating to any sub∣sequent
Confirmation by Act of Par∣liament,
which they conceived they
had no need of.</Q></P>
<P>Nor did the zeal of our learned
<HI>Doctor</HI> here terminate; it was like
<HI>Aarons</HI> Ointment, that descended from
his Beard to the lowest Skirts and Frin∣ges
of his Garments. For first, as for
the Bishops, he did not only write for
them when their Order flourished, but
<PB N="227" REF="127"/>
he defended their Function and Honor
when their power was expired. For
that Episcopacy might never revive in
this Kingdom, its enemies used all pos∣sible
endeavours to render it odious to
all sober and considering Christians.
And to do that, 1. The Bishops were
made the cause of the Civil War; to
which calumny our <HI>Doctor</HI> answers;
<Q>Its true, the <HI>Covenan∣teers</HI>
called it the <HI>Bishops
War,</HI> and gave out,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Observ.</HI> on—151.</NOTE> that
it was raised only to
maintain the <HI>Hierarchy;</HI> The truth
is, <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Episcopacy</HI> were made
the <HI>occasions,</HI> but they were not the
<HI>causes</HI> of the War; Religion being
but the Vizard to disguise the busi∣ness,
which Covetousness, Sacriledg
and Rapine had the greatest hand in.
But the thing was thus. The King
being engaged in a War with <HI>Spain,</HI>
and yet deserted by those men who
engaged him in it, was fain to have
recourse to such other ways of Assi∣stance
as were offered to him.</Q> But
<PB N="228" REF="128"/>
what those ways were will be too te∣dious
to acquaint the Reader with in
this place: he may better inform him∣self
in the <HI>Observations</HI> on Master
<HI>L'Estrange</HI> his <HI>History.</HI> 2. Another
Engine raised to demolish <HI>Episcopacy,</HI>
was to persuade the People that Bi∣shops
were an imperious proud sort of
men, or as Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> (who was resol∣ved
as well to make up the measure of
his own Incivilities as of the Bishops
Afflictions) a <HI>Turgid persecuting sort of
Prelacy;</HI> as also that in respect of their
Studies, they were no way fit for Go∣vernment,
or to be <HI>Barons</HI> in Parlia∣ment.
Unto which the <HI>Doctor</HI> answers
with an old story of a Nobleman in
K. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII's time, who told Mr.
<HI>Pace</HI> one of the Kings <HI>Secretaries,</HI> in
contempt of Learning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exam. Hist. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>46.</NOTE>
<HI>That it was enough for</HI>
Noblemens <HI>Sons to Wind
their</HI> Horn, <HI>and carry
their</HI> Hawk <HI>fair, and leave Learning
to the study of mean men.</HI> <Q>To whom
Mr. <HI>Pace</HI> replied, <HI>Then you and other</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="128"/>
Noblemen <HI>must be content that your
Children may wind their</HI> Horns <HI>and
keep their</HI> Hawks, <HI>whilst the Children
of mean men do manage matters of
State.</HI> And certainly there can be no
reason, why men that have been ver∣sed
in Books, studied in Histories, and
thereby made acquainted with the
chiefest Occurrences of most States
and Kingdoms, should not be thought
as fit to manage the Affairs of State,
as those who spend their time in
Hawking or Hunting, if not in worse
Employments. For that a <HI>Superin∣duction</HI>
of Holy Orders should prove
a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> to all civil prudence, is
such a wild extravagant fancy, as
no man of Judgment can allow of.</Q>
And as for the Clergies Pride and Co∣vetousness,
he thus tells their Accuser:
<Q>How sad their Conditi∣on
is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cert. Epist. 44.</NOTE> and under what
impossibilities of giving
content unto the people. For if they
keep close, and privately, and live
any thing below their Fortunes, the
<PB N="230" REF="129"/>
People then cry out, <HI>O the base sor∣didness
of the Clergy!</HI> But if accord∣ing
to their means, or in any out∣ward
lustre; then on the other side,
<HI>Oh the pride of the Clergy!</HI> But tell
me (Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>) if you can, in what
the <HI>Turgidness</HI> or high swelling pride
of the Prelates did appear most vi∣sibly.
Was it in the bravery of their
Apparel, or in the train of their At∣tendance,
or in their Lordly Port, or
lofty looks, or in all, or in none?
Admitting the most and worst you
can of these particulars, would you
have men that shine in a <HI>higher Orb,</HI>
move in a <HI>lower Sphere,</HI> than that
in which God has placed them? Or
being rank'd in Order and Degree
about you, would you not have
them keep that distance which be∣longs
to their Places: Or because
you affect a <HI>Parity</HI> in the Church,
would you have all men brought to
the same <HI>Level</HI> with your self, with∣out
admitting <HI>Sub</HI> and <HI>Supra</HI> in the
Scale of Government? If they were
<PB N="231" REF="129"/>
your <HI>Fathers in God,</HI> why did not
you look upon them with such re∣verence
as becomes Children? If
your <HI>Superiors in the Lord,</HI> why did
not you yield them that subjection
which was due unto them? If fix'd
in Place and Power above you by
the Laws of the Land only, and no
more than so, why did not you give
obedience to those Laws under which
you lived, and by which you were
to be directed? Take heed I beseech
you Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> that more Spiritual
Pride be not found in that heart of
yours, than ever you found worldly
and external Pride in any of my
Lords the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hops; and that you do
not trample on them with greater
insolence (<HI>Calco platonis Fastum, sed
majori Fastu,</HI> as you know who said)
in these unfortunate days of their
Calamity, than ever they expressed
toward any in the time of their Glo∣ry.
Were it my case, as it is yours,
I would not for ten thousand worlds
depart this life, before I had obtained
<PB N="232" REF="130"/>
their pardon, and given satisfaction
to the world for these horrible Scan∣dals.</Q>
3. As for those persons that
were heartily affected with <HI>Episcopacy,</HI>
and dissatisfied with the extinction of
an Order so sacred and venerable, there
was this way found out to quiet their
di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>contents, <HI>viz.</HI> to persuade them that
<HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> were of equivo∣lent
importance, and comprehended
under the same name in the Holy Scri∣ptures. <Q>But grant (says
this their Champion)
that they be so:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obser. 183.</NOTE> who,
that pretends to <HI>Logick,</HI> can dispute
so lamely, as from a <HI>Community</HI> of
names to infer an <HI>Identity</HI> or <HI>Same∣ness</HI>
in the thing so named? <HI>Kings</HI> are
called <HI>Gods</HI> in Holy Scripture; and
God does frequently call himself by
the name of <HI>King:</HI> yet if a man
should thence infer, that from this
<HI>Community</HI> of names, there arises an
<HI>Identity</HI> or <HI>Sameness</HI> between God
and the King, he might worthily be
condemned for so great a Blasphe∣mer.
<PB N="233" REF="130"/>
St. <HI>Peter</HI> calls our Saviour Christ
by the name of <HI>Bishop,</HI>
and himself a <HI>Presbyter</HI>
or <HI>Priest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet 2. 25.</NOTE> or an <HI>Elder,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5. 1.</NOTE> as
we unhandsomly read
it: yet were it a sorry piece of <HI>Lo∣gick</HI>
to conclude from hence, that
there is no distinction between an
<HI>Apostle</HI> and an <HI>Elder,</HI> the Prince of
the Apostles, and a simple <HI>Presbyter;</HI>
or between Christ the Supreme <HI>Pa∣stor</HI>
of his Church and every ordinary
<HI>Bishop.</HI> Lastly, take it for granted
that <HI>Bishops</HI> have an <HI>Identity</HI> or <HI>Same∣ness</HI>
in <HI>Name, Office, Ordination</HI> and
<HI>Qualification</HI> with <HI>Presbyters,</HI> it will
not follow convertibly that <HI>Presby∣ters</HI>
have the like <HI>Identity</HI> or <HI>Same∣ness</HI>
of <HI>Qualification, Ordination, Name</HI>
and <HI>Office,</HI> which the <HI>Bishop</HI> hath.
My reason is, because a <HI>Bishop</HI> being
first Regularly and Canonically to be
made a Priest before he take the Or∣der
and Degree of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> hath in
him all the <HI>Qualifications,</HI> the <HI>Ordina∣tion,
Name</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> which a <HI>Presbyter</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="131"/>
has; and something further super∣added,
as well in point of <HI>Order</HI> and
<HI>Iurisdiction,</HI> which every <HI>Presbyter</HI>
hath not: So that altho every <HI>Bishop</HI>
be a <HI>Priest,</HI> or <HI>Presbyter,</HI> yet every
<HI>Presbyter</HI> is not a <HI>Bishop.</HI> To make
this clear by an example in the <HI>Civil</HI>
Government. When Sir <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI>
Knight, and principal <HI>Secretary</HI> of
State was made first Earl of <HI>Salisbu∣ry,</HI>
and then Lord <HI>Treasurer,</HI> continu∣ing
<HI>Knight</HI> and <HI>Secretary</HI> as he was
before; it might be said that he had
an <HI>Identity</HI> or <HI>Sameness</HI> in <HI>Name, Of∣fice,
Order</HI> and <HI>Qualification</HI> with Sir
<HI>Iohn Herbert</HI> the other Secretary;
yet this could not be said reciprocally
of Sir <HI>Iohn Herbert,</HI> because there
was something superadded to Sir <HI>Ro∣bert
Cecil, viz.</HI> the Dignity of an <HI>Earl</HI>
and the Office of Lord <HI>Treasurer,</HI>
which the other had not. So true is
that of <HI>Lactantius, Adeo argumenta
ex absurdo petita ineptos habent exi∣tus.</HI>
It is ordinary for Arguments
built upon weak grounds to have
<PB N="235" REF="131"/>
worse Conclusions.</Q> And a better In∣stance
cannot be given of this, than in
the Retortion that Mr.
<HI>Selden</HI> made to one in the
House of <HI>Commons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. 188.</NOTE> who
disputed against the Divine Right of
<HI>Episcopacy,</HI> His argument was this.
<Q>1. That <HI>Bishops</HI> are <HI>Iure Divino</HI> is
of Question. 2. That <HI>Archbishops</HI>
are not <HI>Iure Divino</HI> is out of Que∣stion.
3. That <HI>Ministers</HI> are <HI>Iure
Divino,</HI> there is no Question. Now
if <HI>Bishops</HI> which are questioned whe∣ther
<HI>Iure Divino</HI> shall Suspend Mi∣nisters
which are <HI>Iure Divino,</HI> I leave
it to you Mr. <HI>Speaker.</HI> Which Mr.
<HI>Selden</HI> (whether with greater Wit or
Scorn is hard to say) thus retorted on
him. 1. That the <HI>Convocation</HI> is
<HI>Iure Divino,</HI> is a Question. 2. That
<HI>Parliaments</HI> are not <HI>Iure Divino,</HI> is
out of Question. 3. That <HI>Religion</HI>
is <HI>Iure Divino,</HI> is no Question. Now,
Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> that the <HI>Convocation</HI>
which is questioned whether <HI>Iure
Divino,</HI> and <HI>Parliaments</HI> which out
<PB N="236" REF="132"/>
of Question are not <HI>Iure Divino,</HI>
should meddle with <HI>Religion,</HI> which
questionless is <HI>Iure Divino,</HI> I leave to
you Mr. <HI>Speaker.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There are some other Points relating
to <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> has
long time since cleared and determi∣ned.
And if some of our pretending
<HI>States-men</HI> had considered and read
what was written upon those Subjects,
their time and pains would have been
more profitably spent to the honor and
security of this Church and Kingdom,
than in raising doubts and scruples,
which had long before been so clearly
stated and resolved. For, 1. As for
<HI>Bishops</HI> sitting in Parliament to Vote
in Causes of <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> this the
<HI>Doctor</HI> evinced not only in the Tract,
entituled, <HI>De Iure parita∣tis
Episcoporum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 224.</NOTE> but in his
<HI>Observations</HI> upon Mr.
<HI>L'Estrange</HI>'s <HI>History,</HI> where he says,
<Q>that altho the ancient <HI>Canons</HI></Q> disable
<HI>Bishops</HI> from Sentencing any man to
Death, yet they do not from being <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sistants</HI>
<PB N="237" REF="132"/>
in such cases; from taking Ex∣aminations,
hearing Depositions of Wit∣nesses,
or giving Counsel in such mat∣ters
as they saw occasion. The <HI>Bishops</HI>
sitting as <HI>Peers</HI> in the <HI>English</HI> Parlia∣ment,
were never excluded from the
Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s Trial, from any
such <HI>Assistances,</HI> as by their Gravity and
Learning and other Abilities, they
were enabled to give in any dark and
difficult business (tho of <HI>Blood</HI> and
<HI>Death</HI>) which were brought before
them. 2. With the like solid reason∣ing,
the <HI>Doctor</HI> has evinced the <HI>Bishops</HI>
to be one of the <HI>Three Estates.</HI> For,
not to mention what he says upon this
Argument in his <HI>Stumbling-Block of
Disobedience:</HI> That they have their
Vote in Parliament as a <HI>Third Estate,</HI>
not in capacity of <HI>Temporal Barons</HI>
(altho they are so, as Mr.
<HI>Selden</HI> evinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Yitles of Hon.</HI> p. 2. cap. 5.</NOTE> and an
Act of Parliament, <HI>Stat.</HI>
25. <HI>Edw.</HI> III.) will evi∣dently
appear from these following Reasons, <Q>For, first the Clergy in all
<PB N="238" REF="133"/>
other Christian Kingdoms of these
<HI>North-West</HI> Parts make the <HI>Third
Estate;</HI> that is to say, in the <HI>German</HI>
Empire, as appears by <HI>Thuanus</HI> the
<HI>Historian, lib.</HI> 2. In <HI>France,</HI> as is af∣firmed
by <HI>Paulus Aemilius, lib.</HI> 9.
In <HI>Spain,</HI> as testifieth <HI>Bodinus de Re∣publ.
lib.</HI> 3. For which also consult
the general <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> as in
point of practice, <HI>lib.</HI> 9, 10, 11, 14.
In <HI>Hungary,</HI> as witnesseth <HI>Bonfinius,
Decl. 2. lib.</HI> 1. In <HI>Poland,</HI> as is verified
by <HI>Thuanus</HI> also, <HI>l.</HI> 56. In <HI>Denmark,</HI>
as <HI>Pontanus</HI> tells us <HI>in Historia rerum
Danicarum, l.</HI> 7. The <HI>Swedes</HI> observing
anciently the same Form and Order
of Government as was used by the
<HI>Danes.</HI> The like we find in <HI>Cambden</HI>
for the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which
anciently the <HI>Lords Spiritual,</HI> viz.
<HI>Bishops, Abbots,</HI> and <HI>Priors</HI> made the
<HI>Third Estate.</HI> And certainly it was
very strange, if the <HI>Bishops</HI> and other
Prelates in the Realm of <HI>England,</HI>
being a great and powerful Body,
should move in a lower Sphere in
<PB N="239" REF="133"/>
<HI>England,</HI> than they do elsewhere.
But 2dly. Not to stand only upon
probable inferences, we find first in
History, touching the Reign and
Acts of <HI>Henry</HI> V. <HI>That when his Fu∣nerals
were ended, the</HI> Three Estates
<HI>of the Realm of</HI> England <HI>did assemble
together, and declared his Son King</HI>
Henry VI. <HI>being an Infant of eight
Months old to be their Sovereign
Lord, as his Heir and Successor.</HI> And
if the <HI>Lords Spiritual</HI> did not then
make the <HI>Third Estate,</HI> I would fain
know who did? Secondly, The <HI>Pe∣tition</HI>
tendred to <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of
<HI>Glocester,</HI> to accept the Crown, oc∣curring
in the Parliament Rolls, runs
in the name of the <HI>Three Estates</HI> of
the Realm, that is to say, the <HI>Lords
Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal,</HI> and the <HI>Com∣mons</HI>
thereof. Thirdly, <HI>In the said
Parliament of the said</HI> Rich. <HI>Crowned
King, it is said expresly, That at the
request and by the consent of the</HI> Three
Estates <HI>of this Realm, that is to say,
the</HI> Lords Spiritual <HI>and</HI> Temporal,
<PB N="240" REF="134"/>
<HI>and</HI> Commons <HI>of this Land Assembled
in this present Parliament, and by Au∣thority
of the same, it be Pronounced,
Decreed and Declared, That our Sove∣reign
Lord the King was and is the ve∣ry
and undoubted King of this Realm
of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Fourthly, <HI>It is acknow∣ledged
in the</HI> Statute of 1. <HI>Eliz.</HI> c. 3.
<HI>where the</HI> Lords Spiritual <HI>and</HI> Tempo∣ral,
<HI>and the</HI> Commons <HI>in that Par∣liament
Assembled, being said ex∣presly
and</HI> in terminis, <HI>to represent
the</HI> Three Estates <HI>of this Realm of</HI>
England, <HI>did recognize the Queens Ma∣jesty
to be their true, lawful, and un∣doubted
Sovereign Liege Lady and
Queen.</HI> Add unto these the Testi∣mony
of Sir <HI>Edward Cooke,</HI> tho a pri∣vate
person, who in his Book of the
<HI>Iurisdiction of Courts</HI> (published by
Order of the <HI>Long Parliament) c.</HI> 1.
doth expresly say, <HI>That the Parlia∣ment
consists of the Head and the Body,
that the Head is the King, that the
Body is the</HI> Three Estates, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Lords Spiritual, Temporal,</HI> and the
<PB N="241" REF="134"/>
<HI>Commons.</HI> In which words we have
not only the Opinion and Testimo∣ny
of that learned Lawyer, but the
Authority of the <HI>Long Parliament</HI>
also, tho against it self.</Q></P>
<P>I hope the perusal of these things
will be no less acceptable to the sober
Reader, than the transcribing of them
has been unto my self; which I have
done to the end as well of informing
my Country-men about the Rights of
the Crown and Privileges of the
Church and Clergy, as to shew that
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> had a zeal according unto
knowledg, and was not less zealous
for knowledge-sake.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Doctor</HI> having thus stood up
in the defence of <HI>Monarchy</HI> and <HI>Hie∣rarchy,</HI>
both in their prosperous and
adverse condition; when the black
Cloud was dispelled, and a fair Sun∣shine
began to dawn upon these harras∣sed
and oppressed <HI>Islands,</HI> by the Re∣turn
of his Sacred Majesty, this excel∣lent
man having in his mind <HI>Tullies</HI>
Resolution, <HI>Defendi Rempub. Adole∣scens,
<PB N="242" REF="135"/>
non deseram Senex,</HI> thought it
unbecoming him to desert the Church
in any of its pressing needs: and there∣fore
when the <HI>door of Hope</HI> began to
<HI>open,</HI> he busied his active and search∣ing
mind in finding out several expedi∣ents
for the restoring and securing of
its Power and Privileges in future Ages
against the attempts of Factious and
Sacrilegious men. And the first thing
that he engaged in, was to draw up
several Papers, and tender them to
those Persons in Authrority, who in the
days of Anarchy and Oppression, had
given the most signal Testimonies of
their Affection to the Church. In
which Papers he first shewed what Al∣terations,
Explanations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were made
in the Publick <HI>Liturgy</HI> in the Reigns
of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
and King <HI>Iames;</HI> that so those who
were intrusted with so sacred a <HI>Deposi∣tum,</HI>
might be the better enabled to
proceed in the Alteration and enlarge∣ment
of it; as they afterward did, and
as it now stands by Law Established
<PB N="243" REF="135"/>
in this Church. Secondly, Whereas
in the first year of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.
it was enacted that all <HI>Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, &amp;c.</HI> should make their <HI>Proces∣ses,
Writings,</HI> and <HI>Instruments</HI> in the
Kings name, and not under their own
Names—(which <HI>Act</HI> was afterward
extended unto <HI>Ordinations,</HI> as appears
by the Form of a Testimonial extant
in <HI>Sanders</HI>'s Seditious Book, <HI>De Schis∣mate
Anglicano</HI>) and whereas the <HI>Act</HI>
was repealed in the last year of Queen
<HI>Mary,</HI> and did stand so repealed all
the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> but was
by the activity of some, and the inco∣gitancy
of others revived again in the
first year of King <HI>Iames,</HI> but lay dor∣ment
all the Reign of that Prince, and
during the first ten years of King
<HI>Charles</HI> I. after which it was endeavou∣red
to be set on foot by some distur∣bers
of the Publick Peace; upon which,
the King having it under the hand of
his Judges, that the proceedings of the
<HI>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, &amp;c.</HI> were not
contrary to the Laws of the Land, in∣serted
<PB N="244" REF="136"/>
their Judgment about it in a
<HI>Proclamation</HI> for indemnifying the <HI>Bi∣shops,</HI>
and the satisfying of his loving
Subjects in that Point; therefore Dr.
<HI>Heylyn</HI> considering that what the Jud∣ges
did was extrajudicial, and that the
Kings <HI>Proclamation</HI> expired at his
Death, solicited the concerns of the
Church in this Affair, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Act</HI>
so pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, as before is said, in the first of
King <HI>Iames,</HI> might be repealed, that so
the <HI>Bishops</HI> might proceed as formerly
in the exercise of their Jurisdiction
without fear or danger. Thirdly,
Whereas in the 16. year of <HI>Charles.</HI> I.
there passed an <HI>Act</HI> that no <HI>Arch-Bishop,
Bishop, &amp;c.</HI> should minister any
Corporal Oath unto any <HI>Church-War∣den,
Sideman,</HI> or any other person
whatsoever, with many other things
whereby the whole <HI>Episcopal</HI> Jurisdi∣ction
was subverted (except <HI>Canonical</HI>
Obedience only) and all proceedings in
Courts <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> in Causes <HI>Matri∣monial,
Testamentory,</HI> &amp;c. were wea∣kened,
and all <HI>Episcopal</HI> Visitations
<PB N="245" REF="136"/>
were made void as to the ordinary Pu∣nishments
of <HI>Heresie, Schism, Non-con∣formity,
Incest, Adultery</HI> and other
Crimes of <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Cognizance,
therefore Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI> stated the Case,
and in a Petition drawn up by him,
prayed, that for the restoring of the
<HI>Episcopal</HI> Jurisdiction, the Clauses of
that <HI>Act,</HI> and the penalties thereunto
annexed, might be wholly abrogated
and annulled.</P>
<P>But the most remarkable Effort of
his zeal for the Church, after the Kings
Restauration, was the Application
made by him to the great Minister of
State in those days, that there might be
a <HI>Convocation</HI> called with the Parlia∣ment.
What good effects were produ∣ced
by his endeavours in that particu∣lar,
let the Reader judg, when he has
perused the following <HI>Letter,</HI> with
which the Reverend <HI>Doctor</HI> saluted
that powerful <HI>Statesman.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="246" REF="137"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable and my very good
Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>I Cannot tell how welcome or un∣welcome
this Address may prove
in regard of the greatness of the Cause
and the low condition of the Party,
who negotiates in it. But I am apt
enough to persuade my self, that the
honest zeal which moves me to it,
not only will excuse, but endear the
boldness.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is, my Lord, a general
Speech, but a more general Fear
withal amongst some of the Clergy,
that there will be no <HI>Convocation</HI> cal∣led
with the following Parliament;
which if it should be so resolved on,
cannot but raise sad thoughts in the
hearts of those, who wish the peace
and happiness of our <HI>English Sion.</HI>
But being the Bishops are excluded
from their Votes in Parliament, there
is no other way to keep up their Ho∣nor
and Esteem in the eyes of the
<PB N="247" REF="137"/>
people, but the retaining of their
places in the <HI>Convocation.</HI> Nor have
the lower Clergy any other means to
shew their duty to the King, and
keep that little freedom which is left
unto them, then by assembling in
such Meetings, where they may ex∣ercise
the Power of a <HI>Convocation,</HI> in
granting <HI>Subsidies</HI> to his Majesty, tho
in nothing else. And should that
Power be taken from them, according
to the constant (but unprecedented)
practice of the late Long Parliament,
and that they must be taxed and ra∣ted
with the rest of the Subjects with∣out
their liking and consent, I cannot
see what will become of the first <HI>Ar∣ticle</HI>
of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> so solemnly,
so frequently confirmed in Parliament,
or what can possibly be left unto them
of either of the Rights or Liberties
belonging to an <HI>English Subject.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>I know 'tis conceived by some, that
the distrust which his Majesty hath
in some of the Clergy, and the Diffi∣dence
which the Clergy have of one
<PB N="248" REF="138"/>
another, is looked on as the principal
cause of the <HI>Innovation:</HI> For I must
needs behold it as an <HI>Innovation,</HI> that
any Parliament should be called with∣out
a meeting of the Clergy at the
same time with it. The first year of
King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. Qu. <HI>Mary,</HI> and Qu.
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> were times of greater diffi∣dence
and distraction, than this pre∣sent
Conjuncture. And yet no Parlia∣ment
was called in the beginning of
their several Reigns, without the
company and attendance of the <HI>Con∣vocation,</HI>
tho the intendments of the
State aimed then at greater alterati∣ons
in the face of the Church, than
are now pretended or desired. And
to say the truth, there was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anger
to be feared from a <HI>Convocation,</HI> tho
the times were ticklish and unsettled,
and the Clergy was divided into
Sides and Factions, as the case then
stood, and so stands with us at
this present time. For since the Clergy
in their <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vocations</HI> are in no Autho∣thority
to propound, treat, or con∣clude
<PB N="249" REF="138"/>
any thing (more than the pas∣sing
of a <HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Subsides</HI> for his
Majesties use) until they are impow∣red
by the Kings <HI>Commission,</HI> the King
may tie them up for what time he
pleases, and give them nothing but
the opportunity of entertaining one
another with the news of the day.
But if it be objected, that the <HI>Com∣mission</HI>
now on foot for altering and
explaining certain passages in the Pub∣lick
<HI>Liturgy,</HI> that either pass instead
of a <HI>Convocation,</HI> or else is thought to
be neither competable nor consistent
with it; I hope far better in the one, and
must profess that I can see no reason in
the other. For first, I hope that the se∣lecting
of some few Bishops and other
learned men of the lower Clergy to
debate on certain Points contained in
the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> is not inten∣ded
for a <HI>Representation</HI> of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> which is a Body more
diffused, and cannot legally stand
bound by their <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Counsets.</HI>
And if this <HI>Conference</HI> be for no other
<PB N="250" REF="139"/>
purpose, but only to prepare matter
for a <HI>Convocation</HI> (as some say it is
not) why may not such a <HI>Conference</HI>
and <HI>Convocation</HI> be held both at once?
For neither the selecting of some lear∣ned
men out of both the <HI>Orders</HI> for
the composing and reviewing of the
two <HI>Liturgies</HI> digested in the Reign
of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. proved any hin∣drance
in the calling of those <HI>Convo∣cations,</HI>
which were held both in the
second and third, and in the fifth and
sixth of the said Kings Reign. Nor
was it found that the holding of a
<HI>Convocation</HI> together with the first
Parliament under Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
proved any hindrance to that <HI>Confe∣rence</HI>
or <HI>Disputation</HI> which was de∣signed
between the Bishops and some
learned men of the opposite parties.
All which considered, I do most hum∣bly
beg your Lordship to put his Ma∣jesty
in mind of sending out his Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dates
to the two <HI>Arch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bishops</HI> for
summoning a <HI>Convocation</HI> (according
to the usual Form) in their several
<PB N="251" REF="139"/>
<HI>Provinces,</HI> that this poor Church may
be held with some degree of Venera∣tion,
both at home and abroad. And
in the next place, I do no less humbly
beseech your Lordship to excuse this
freedom, which nothing but my zeal
for Gods glory and my affection to
this Church could have forced from
me. I know how ill this present of∣fice
does become me, and how much
fitter it had been, for such as shine in a
more eminent Sphere in the holy <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rarchy</HI>
to have tendered these Parti∣culars
to consideration. Which since
they either have not done, or that no
visible effect hath appeared thereof, I
could not chuse but cast my poor
Mite into the Treasury; which if it
may conduce to the Churches good, I
shall have my wish; and howsoever
shall be satisfied in point of Consci∣ence,
that I have not failed of doing
my duty to this Church, according
to the light of my understanding;
and then what happens unto me shall
not be material. And thus again most
<PB N="252" REF="140"/>
humbly craving pardon for this pre∣sumption,
I kiss your Lordships hands,
and subscribe my self</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Having thus surveyed the most im∣portant
Occurrences of Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s
Life, I doubt not but every judicious
and impartial Reader will be convinced
at once of his vast Abilities and Ac∣quirements
in the large Circle of Lear∣ning
and Sciences, of his immovable
Integrity in the Protestant Religion,
and of his indefatigable Industry and
Service to the just Interests both of the
Crown and Mitre. For tho I will not
say as St. <HI>Paul</HI> does of his Son <HI>Timothy,</HI>
that there was <HI>no man like-minded,</HI> yet
no one had more hearty and unbiassed
affections, no man did more <HI>naturally
<PB N="235" REF="140"/>
care</HI> for this Church and Kingdom than
Dr. <HI>Heylyn;</HI> and at that time too, when
he expected nothing for his pains and
industry, but all the miseries and mis∣chiefs,
which armed Malice and succes∣ful
usurp'd Tyranny could inflict upon
him. Preach indeed he could not in
those days of danger and persecution.
But he plentifully made up that una∣voidable
omission by his Writings:
through all which there runs such a na∣tive
plainness and elegancy, as can be
parallel'd in very few of the Writers of
that Age he lived in. In all his Books
his Stile is smooth and masculine, his
Sence full and copious, his Words plain
and intelligible, his Notions numerous
and perspicuous, his Arguments per∣tinent,
ponderous and convincing.
Those Accomplishments which rarely
concentred in any Individual, were in
Doctor <HI>Heylyn,</HI> in their eminency and
perfection, <HI>viz.</HI> a solid Judgment, an
acute Wit, a rich teeming Fancy, and
a memory so prodigiously quick and
tenacious, that it was the Store-house
<PB N="254" REF="141"/>
of most Arts and Sciences. And which
is most wonderful, it was not impaired
either by Age or by Afflictions. For
many of those learned Volumes that
have his learned Name annexed to
them, were writ when his Sight failed
him. And here I cannot forget that
deserved Character, which a right lear∣ned
man, and now an eminent Prelate
of our Church bestowed on him, <HI>viz.</HI>
That Dr. <HI>Heylyn never writ any Book,
let the Argument be never so mean and
trivial, but it was worthy of a Scholars
reading.</HI> And another very celebrated
<HI>Professor</HI> (now) in <HI>Oxon,</HI> paying him the
respects of a Visit at <HI>Abingdon,</HI> retur∣ned
home with the profoundes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Admi∣ration
of his incomparable Abilities,
saying, <HI>That he never heard any</HI> Do∣ctor
<HI>of the</HI> Chair <HI>deliver his Iudgment
more copiously and perspicuously upon any
Subject, than our</HI> Doctor <HI>did upon those
various Theological Points, that were
proposed to him.</HI> Insomuch that what
<HI>Livie</HI> affirmed of <HI>Cato,</HI> might without
any injury to Truth be affirmed of
<PB N="255" REF="141"/>
this Reverend person, <HI>Natum ad id di∣ceres,
quodcunque ageret.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis just matter of wonder, how
any Scholar that had so many Sicknes∣ses
and Avocations from the <HI>Muses</HI> in
his Childhood and Youth, and that
was incumbred with the burthen of so
many secular businesses in his middle
Age, should arrive to such vast know∣ledg
and improvements. For he was a
<HI>Critick</HI> (and that no vulgar one) both in
the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> Languages: A
polite <HI>Humanist,</HI> being exactly acquain∣ted
with the best <HI>Poets, Orators</HI> and <HI>Hi∣storians:</HI>
He was also an excellent
<HI>Poet;</HI> but a more able Judg of it in
others, than a practiser of it himself.
<HI>Philosophy</HI> he studied no farther, than
as it was subservient to nobler Con∣templations.
But as for <HI>History, Chro∣nology,</HI>
and <HI>Geography,</HI> they were as fa∣miliar
to him, as the Transactions of
one months business can be to any pri∣vate
person. And that <HI>Divine</HI> is yet
to be named, whose knowledg did ex∣ceed
Dr. <HI>Heylyn's</HI> in the <HI>Canon, Civil,
<PB N="256" REF="142"/>
Statute,</HI> or <HI>Common</HI> Laws: To the
profession of which last if he had be∣took
himself, few men in the Nation
would have exceeded him either in
Fame or Estate.</P>
<P>In all things that were either spoke
or writ by him, he did <HI>loqui cum vulgo,</HI>
so speak as to be understood by the
meanest Hearer, and so write as to be
comprehended by the most vulgar Rea∣der.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observ. on the Hist.—<HI>page</HI> 2.</NOTE>
<Q>It is true indeed
(as he himself observes)
that when there is ne∣cessity
of using either
<HI>Terms</HI> of <HI>Law,</HI> or <HI>Logical</HI> Notions,
or any other words of <HI>Art,</HI> an Au∣thor
is then to keep himself to such
<HI>Terms</HI> and <HI>Words,</HI> as are transmitted
to us by the Learned in their several
Faculties. But to affect <HI>new Notions,</HI>
and indeed <HI>new Nothings,</HI> when there
is no necessity to invite us to it, is a
Vein of writing which the two great
Masters of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Elo∣quence
had no knowledg of. But
many think, that they can never speak
<PB N="257" REF="142"/>
elegantly, nor write significantly, ex∣cept
they do it in a language of their
own devising, as if they were asha∣med
of their Mother-Tongue, and
thought it not sufficiently curious to
express their fancies. By means where∣of
more <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> words
have gained ground upon us since
the middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> than
were admitted by our Ancestors
(whether we look upon them as the
<HI>British</HI> or <HI>Saxon</HI> Race) not only since
the <HI>Norman,</HI> but the <HI>Roman</HI> Con∣quest.
A folly handsomly derided in
an old blunt <HI>Epigram,</HI> where the
spruce Gallant thus bespeaks his
Page, or Laquey</Q>
<Q><L>Diminutive and my defective Slave,</L>
<L>Reach my Corps Coverture immediately:</L>
<L>'Tis my complacency that Vest to have,</L>
<L>T' insconce my person from Frigidity.</L>
<L>The Boy believed all <HI>Welsh</HI> his Ma∣ster
spoke,</L>
<L><HI>Till rail'd in</HI> English, <HI>Rogue go fetch
my Cloak.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="143"/>
And yet this simplicity and plain∣ness
of writing is the true cause, why
so many were heretofore and are still
scandalized at the <HI>Doctors</HI> Books. But
let the Reader attend to him whilst he
pleads for himself:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pref. to <HI>Theol. Vet.</HI></NOTE> <Q>The
truth is, I never volunta∣rily
engaged my self in
any of those publick
Quarrels, by which the Unity and
Order of the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath
been so miserably distracted in these
later times. Nor have I lov'd to run
before or against Authority; but al∣ways
took the just Counsels and
Commands thereof for my ground
and warrant: which when I had re∣ceived,
I could not think that there
was any thing left on my part, but
<HI>obsequii gloria,</HI> the honor of a chear∣ful
and free obedience. And in this
part of my obedience, it was my lot
most commonly to be employ'd in
the <HI>Puritan</HI> Controversies; in mana∣ging
of which, altho I used all <HI>equa∣nimity</HI>
and temper which reasonably
<PB N="259" REF="143"/>
could be expected (the argument and
persons against whom I writ being
well considered) yet I did thereby so
exasperate that prevailing party, that
I became the greatest object of their
spleen and fury.</Q></P>
<P>When the Jewish Libertines could
not resist the wisdom, and spirit, and
excellence of Elocution
with which St. <HI>Stephen</HI>
defended himself and
blessed Saviour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 6. 10.</NOTE> we find in the next
<HI>Chapter,</HI> that his enemies deserted all
rational arguings, and betook them∣selves
to acts of the most inhumane
violence; first <HI>gnashing upon him with
their teeth,</HI> and then assaulting him with
stones. Add the truth is, Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>
had few other answers returned to the
many learned Volumes written by him,
besides vollies of audacious and viru∣lent
slanders to wound his name, and
to hinder easie and credulous persons
from perusing of his Books. He tells
one, who called him the <HI>Primipilus,</HI> or
<HI>chief of the Defenders</HI> of Prelacy, that
<PB N="260" REF="144"/>
altho he did sometimes put vinegar in
his Ink to make it quick
and operative,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cert. Epist. 31.</NOTE> as the case
did require, yet there was
nothing of scurrility or malice in it;
nothing that savoured of uncharita∣bleness,
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of such bitter reproaches,
as he was unjustly charged with. When
he met with such a Fire-brand as Mr.
<HI>Burton,</HI> it was not to be expected, that
he should pour oil upon him to in∣crease
the flame, and not bring water
to quench it, whether foul or clean.
And when he met with other unsavory
pieces, it was fit that he should rub
them with a little salt to keep them
sweet. The good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> when he
took care of the wounded passenger, is
said to have poured into his wounds
both <HI>Oil</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> i. e. <HI>Oil</HI> to cherish
and refresh it, and <HI>Wine</HI> to cleanse it;
<HI>Oleum quo foveatur, vinum quo morde∣atur.</HI>
He had not been a skilfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chi∣rurgeon,
if he had done otherwise.
And the <HI>Doctor</HI> being to contend with
so many and malicious Adversaries,
<PB N="261" REF="144"/>
had been a very unwary writer, had
he made no distinction, but accosted
them all after one and the same man∣ner.
The grand <HI>Exemplar</HI> of Sweetness,
Candor and Ingenuity, used the seve∣rest
invectives against the hypocritical
<HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees.</HI> Certainly one
Plaister is not medicinal to all kind of
sores; some of which may be cured
with Balm, when others more corrupt
aud putrified, do require a Lancing.
And thus did this Reverend man deal
with the enemies of the King and
Church; insomuch that he received
thanks from the Ministers of <HI>Surrey</HI>
and <HI>Bucks</HI> (in the name of themselves
and that party) for his fair and respect∣ful
language to them, both in his Pre∣face
to his <HI>History of the Sabbath</HI> and
conclusion of the same. To conclude,
unless good words may receive pollu∣tion
by confuting bad principles, and
describing bad things, nothing of any
rude or uncharitable language can be
found in any of the Writings of Dr.
<HI>Heylyn,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="145"/>
But as all men have not abilities to
write Books, so neither to pass sentence
on them, when written. And yet what∣ever
hard censures the <HI>Doctors</HI> Books
have met with in the world, I am per∣suaded
his most inveterate enemies
who will have but so much patience
as to peruse impartially this Account
given of his Life, will believe that one
who had acted, written and suffered
so much in the defence of the King and
Church, might have met with some
Rewards or Respects in some measure
suitable to his merits. But God Almigh∣ty
and wise Providence had otherwise
ordered the Event of things; purpo∣sing
(no doubt) that this excellent per∣son,
who had for the greatest part of
his pilgrimage encountred with the
spite and threatnings, oppositions
and persecutions of those who had
subverted Monarchy in the State, and
Order and Decency in the Church,
(should (notwithstanding the Kings Re∣stauration)
have administred to him
another Trial of his passive Fortitude;
<PB N="263" REF="145"/>
and that was to wrestle with the neg∣lects
and ingratitude of his Friends.
Indeed some Right Reverend Fathers
in the Church (amongst whom Bishop
<HI>Cousins</HI> ought not to be passed over in
silence) protested not their wonder on∣ly,
but their grief, that so great a Friend
and Sufferer for the Royal Family and
Church, should like the wounded men
in the Gospel, be <HI>passed by</HI> both by
Priest and Levite, and have no recom∣pence
for his past Services, besides the
pleasure of reflecting on them. But
the <HI>States-men</HI> of those days rank'd the
<HI>Doctor</HI> with the <HI>Milites emeriti,</HI> the <HI>old
Cavaliers,</HI> of whose Principles there
could be no fear, and of whose Services
there could be no more need. But not∣withstanding
all the frowns of For∣tune,
yet he could say his <HI>Nunc Dimit∣tis</HI>
with more sensible joy and chear∣fulness,
than he was able to do, for
many of the precedent years; having
the satisfaction to live, (I cannot say to
see) till the King was restored to his
Throne, and the Church to its Immu∣nities
<PB N="264" REF="146"/>
and Rights. <HI>Yea, let them take all,
forasmuch as my Lord the King is come
again in peace unto his own House.</HI> The
<HI>Doctor</HI> had nothing given him, but
what neither Law nor Justice could
detain from him; and that was the
former Preferments that he had in the
Church, from the profits and possession
of which he had been kept above se∣venteen
years. And with those he con∣tentedly
acquiesced; and not unlike
some of the old famous <HI>Romans,</HI> after
they had done all the Services they
could for their Country, returned
home to their poor Wives, and little
Farms, yoking again their Oxen for
the Plough, when they had fettered
their enemies in Chains. Above all,
this excellent Scholar enjoyed the in∣ward
peace and tranquillity of his own
mind; in that he <HI>fought a good fight,
kept the Faith, finished his course,</HI> dis∣charged
his Duty and Trust, and had
been <HI>counted worthy to suffer the loss of
all things</HI> (except his Conscience) for
the best of Princes, and the most
<PB N="265" REF="146"/>
righteous of Causes in the world. And
I pray God grant that an old observati∣on
which I have somewhere met with∣al,
may not be verified either as to
the concerns of Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> or any of
the old <HI>Royallists,</HI> viz. <HI>It is an ill sign
of prosperity to any Kingdom, where such
as deserve well, find no other recompence,
than the peace of their own Consciences.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! all these unkindnesses and
neglects were trivial to the irreparable
loss of his eye-sight: of which he
found a sensible and gradual decay for
many years; and therefore was the
better enabled to endure it. But about
the year 1654. <HI>tenebrescunt videntes
per foramina;</HI> those that looked out of
the windows were darkened, and he
was constrained to make use of other
mens eyes (but not in the sense as great
persons do) to guide him in the Moti∣ons
of his Body▪ tho not in the Con∣templations of his Mind.
Like good old <HI>Iacob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 48. 10.</NOTE> <HI>his
eyes were dim and he could
not see:</HI> but there was this
<PB N="266" REF="147"/>
difference between them, that the <HI>Pa∣triarchs</HI>
eyes were grown dim by rea∣son
of Age, but Dr. <HI>Heylyns</HI> were dar∣ken'd
with Study and Industry. As
the whole frame of his Body was uni∣form,
comely and upright, his Stature
of a middle size and proportion; so
his Eye naturally was strong, sparkling,
and vivacious; and as likely to conti∣nue
useful and serviceable to its Owner,
as any mans whatsoever. But by con∣stant
and indefatigable Study (which
for many years he took in the night,
being hurried up and down with a suc∣cessive
crowd of Business in the day)
either the <HI>Crystalline</HI> humor was dried
up, or the <HI>optick</HI> Nerves became perfo∣rated
and obstructed; by which means
the <HI>Visive</HI> Spirits were stop'd, and an
imperfect kind of <HI>Cataract</HI> was fixed
in his eyes, which neither by inward
Medicines nor outward Remedies
could ever be brought to that maturity
and consistence, as to be fit for cutting.

Author proceeds in presenting his

that were highly useful in their
Generations after they were deprived
of their sight. And Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> as well

useless. And amongst other advantages
which the <HI>Doctor</HI> received from this

I can truly say, that of those short <HI>Me∣moirs</HI>
which he left behind him of the

eleven first <HI>Lustrums</HI> of his Life (for they
extended no further) he ever and anon
intersperses some Religious Sentence or

with which the Divine Providence was

devout affections that he had toward
his Maker and Redeemer; taking all
occasions, according to the various ac∣cidents
aud occurrences that happened
unto him, to stir up his Soul, either to
magnifie the Mercies, or acknowledg
the Justice, or adore the Wisdom, or
trust in the Power, or rely upon the
promises of God. When

space of time; the <HI>Doctor</HI> replies,
<Q>Tho I cannot say that I have many
<HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lpers,</HI> yet I cannot but confess in
<PB N="272" REF="150"/>
all humble Gratitude, that I have one
great <HI>Helper,</HI> which is <HI>instar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mnium,</HI>
even the Lord my God: <HI>Auxilium
meum a Domino, my help cometh even
from the Lord which made Heaven and
Earth.</HI> And I can say with the like
humble acknowledgments of Gods
mercies to me, as <HI>Iacob</HI> did, when he
was ask'd about the quick dispatch
which he made in preparing <HI>savoury
meat</HI> for his aged Father, <HI>Voluntas Dei
fuit ut tam citò occurreret mihi quod
volebam,</HI> Gen. 27. 20. It is Gods good∣ness
and his only, that I am able to do
what I do.</Q></P>
<P>That name is yet to be mentioned,
that was ever loaded with more re∣proach
and infamy than Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>'s.
And he ever kept silence, unless it was
when he was accused of gross errors
against any Fundamentals in Religion:
For that he looked upon to be a self-conviction;
having that advice of St.
<HI>Hierom</HI> frequently in his Writings, but
oftener in his thoughts, <HI>In suspicione
haereseos se nolle quenquem fore patien∣tem.</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="150"/>
But as for private whispers or
bold calumnies, which reach'd only
to the private concerns of his Name
and Repute, they did not in the least
move him; having long learned with
him in the old <HI>Historian</HI> (as he once
told one of his friends) <HI>civili animo la∣ceratam
existimationem ferre,</HI> to bear
with an undisturbed mind the greatest
calumnies which either the tongues or
pens of malicious men could lay upon
him. But when ever the concerns of
Church or State in general, or his
Friends in particular required his hel∣ping
hand, then like the dumb Son of
<HI>Craesus,</HI> he found a Tongue (and a Pen
too) tho no extremity of his own (un∣less
in the Instance now mentioned)
could remove him from his espoused
silence.</P>
<P>And as he had learned to contemn
calumnies himself; so he endeavoured
to fix the same resolution in the poor
ejected Clergy;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cert. Epistola.</HI> Epist. Ded.</NOTE> thus
writing to them, <Q>You,
my Brethren, who have
<PB N="274" REF="151"/>
been so long trained up in the School
of patience; the suffering of Re∣proaches,
whether from theTongue
or Pen, from the Press or Pulpit, can∣not
be taken out as a new Lesson,
never learnt before. I know I speak to
men, who are not to be put in mind
of that which you have learned in
Aesop's Fables: In one of the <HI>Morals,</HI>
you are taught to imitate those gene∣rous
Horses, <HI>Qui latrantes caniculos
cum contemptu praetereunt,</HI> which use
to pass by barking Curs with neglect
and scorn: Or to be told of that
which you once read in
the Annals of <HI>Tacitus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tacit.</HI> Anal. l. 13.</NOTE>
viz. <HI>Convitia spreta exo∣lescunt,</HI>
Those contu∣melies
die soonest, that are least re∣garded:
or to be remembred of that
memorable saying of St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who
had suffered as much in this kind, as
the most amongst us; but having suf∣fered
no more from the tongues of
his enemies, than Christ our Saviour
did before from the hands of <HI>Iudas,</HI>
<PB N="275" REF="151"/>
he thus encouraged himself and
others by this golden sentence, <HI>Nec
nobis turpe esse pati, quae passus est
Christus; nec illis gloriam facere, quae
fecerit</HI> Judas. Which passages, tho
very full of use and comfort, how
infinitely short are they of that cele∣stial
consolation, which our Saviour
gives us in his Gospel, pronouncing
a <HI>Blessing upon all those who are perse∣cuted
and reviled, and against whom
all manner of evil is falsly spoken for
his name sake;</HI> assuring them, that it
<HI>should be cause of gladness and rejoy∣cing
to them</HI> in this present life, and
of great reward in Heaven for the
life to come. Let us therefore be∣have
our selves with such Sobriety
and Moderation, such Piety and
Christian Candor, that the <HI>ignorance
of foolish men may be put to silence,</HI>
and that all those who <HI>speak against
us as evil-doers,</HI> may be convicted of
their faults and malicious speaking,
before God and man.—Let us en∣tertain
Fortune bythe day, and pa∣tiently
<PB N="276" REF="152"/>
submit our selves to the ap∣pointments
of that heavenly Provi∣dence,
which powerfully disposeth
all things to the good of the Uni∣verse.
So doing we shall shew our
selves the Followers of that Lamb of
God, who opened not his mouth be∣fore
the Shearers; the Scholars of
that gracious Master, who when he
was reviled, reviled not again, nor
used any unbecoming speeches in the
midst of his sufferings.</Q></P>
<P>Nor were these the only instances of
Christian Goodness, that were conspicu∣ous
in this Reverend person. His Cha∣rity
was more than verbal or persua∣sive.
For not to enlarge upon those par∣ticular
Testimonies of his Liberality to
private Christians in relieving their
Wants, as well as rescuing them from
their Errors and evil Principles (of
which there might be given consider∣able
Instances) those publick demon∣strations
of his Bounty and Generosity
in contributing to the necessities of his
Prince, not only <HI>to his power, but be∣yond
<PB N="277" REF="152"/>
his power,</HI> ought not to be passed
over in silence. For first in the year
1639. when King <HI>Charles</HI> I. began his
Journey against the <HI>Scots,</HI> the <HI>English</HI>
Clergy by means of Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud</HI>
(but first thought on and proposed by
Dr. <HI>Heylyn</HI>) were aiding and assisting
to his Majesty in their speedy and li∣beral
Contributions; and the <HI>Doctor</HI>
for his Parsonage of <HI>Alresford</HI> gave
50 <HI>l.</HI> for <HI>South-Warnb.</HI> 20 Marks;
and at that time he was in the First-Fruits
for it. He was the very first of
of the Clergy that subscribed in <HI>Ham∣pshire,</HI>
and his example proved so pow∣erful,
that in that very County, the
sum of what was given by the Clergy
amounted to no less than 1348 <HI>l. 2 s.
4 d.</HI> In the year 1642. when the War
was actually begun, he attending up∣on
his Royal Master at <HI>Reading,</HI> made
a <HI>Present</HI> to him of Money and Plate,
to the value of 100 <HI>l.</HI> Neither was his
liberal hand defective in some other In∣stances
of Bounty; for <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 2634.
he gave 20 <HI>l.</HI> toward the repairing of
<PB N="278" REF="153"/>
S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church. And after the return of
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. tho by the neglect of
his Friends he was rendred an object of
scorn and triumph to his Enemies, yet
he gave in the Royal Benevolence 50 <HI>l.</HI>
for his Parsonage of <HI>Alresford,</HI> besides
his share of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> as he was <HI>Preben∣dary</HI>
of <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>And that which enabled him to do
these and many other such Charitable
acts, was an honest Providence or
Thrift; that being (as one calls it) <HI>the
Fuel of Magnificence.</HI> And certainly
our Churches, with other Monuments
of Honor, that are in this and other
Nations erected to the Worship of God
and the benefit of mankind, were no
more built by the riotous prodigal
Spend-thrift, than by the penurious
Mammonist.</P>
<P>Temperance is the common Atten∣dant
of Frugality: in the exercise of
which Virtue, the <HI>Doctor</HI> was a perfect
Christian Philososopher. For in what
ever he eat or drank, he confined him∣self
to simple nourishments, designing
<PB N="279" REF="153"/>
only to satisfie natures necessities; but
never irritating his Appetite with any
artificial Delicacies either of Meat or
Drink. And of all the calumnies with
which his Reputation was sullied and
aspersed, none of his virulent Ene∣mies
had the confidence ever to charge
him either with incontinency or inso∣briety.
For he never gratified or diver∣ted
himself in any wanton behaviour
or brutish desires. And the only rea∣son
that induced him so soon to sorsake
the Seat of the Muses and enter into
the state of Marriage, was to avoid
all unchast and impure inclinations,
and to be possessed of an habitual cha∣stity
of mind, as well as of body. To
preserve which, he had not only a con∣tinual
watchfulness over his Appetite,
being never seen raised by Drink be∣yond
his usual chearfulness; but like
the holy Apostle he was
<HI>in weariness and painful∣ness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 27.</NOTE>
<HI>in watchings often, in
hunger and thirst, in fastings often.</HI> His
Study was seldom without his compa∣ny,
<PB N="280" REF="154"/>
except his Meals, or necessary busi∣ness,
or the Rules of Civility obliged
him to take his leave of it. Little or
no exercise was allowed by him for his
bodily health, except walking in his
House or Garden; and then he was
digesting and fixing those Notions and
Observations in his mind, which he had
before read, or caused to be read to him.
His Fastings or Abstinencies were not
only very frequent, but so long and
tedious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32. 4.</NOTE> that his bodily
<HI>moisture was turned into
the drought of</HI> Summer;
and his digestive faculty became so de∣bilitated
and depraved, that he was
very often subject unto Fevers. And
perhaps the severity and frequency of
his Fastings might be the cause of his
little and short Angers, which were
quickly raised and as speedily still'd
and calmed in him; and were also ren∣dred
very tolerable unto those on
whom they lighted, not only by the
shortness fo their continuance, but by
the wonderful goodness of his Nature,
<PB N="281" REF="154"/>
which express'd it self (as in many other
things, so) in an habitual pleasantness
and chearfulness of conversation, and a
tender compassion to all persons that
groaned under the weight of any Trou∣ble
or Affliction.</P>
<P>The Son of <HI>Syrach</HI> re∣sembles<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. c. 34. 2, 7.</NOTE>
him, that <HI>regar∣deth dreams, to one that
catcheth at a shadow, and followeth af∣ter
the wind,</HI> And he gives a reason,
<HI>For dreams have deceived many, and
those have failed that have put their
trust in them.</HI> But notwithstanding his
decrying of Dreams as vain and foolish;
yet in the very same
Chapter he intimates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 6.</NOTE>
that <HI>if they be sent from
the most High in our Visitation, we may
then set our hearts upon them.</HI> And such
a Dream as this had our Reverend <HI>Do∣ctor</HI>
of his approaching End. For on
<HI>Saturday</HI> night before his fatal Sick∣ness,
he had this Dream, <HI>viz.</HI> That
being in an extraordinary pleasant
Place, and admiring the beauty and
<PB N="282" REF="155"/>
glory of it, he saw King <HI>Charles</HI> I. his
Martyr'd Master, and heard him spea∣king
to him in these words, <HI>viz.</HI> Peter,
<HI>I will have you buried under your Seat
at Church, for you are rarely seen but
there, or in your Study.</HI> This Dream
he related to his Wife the very next
morning, telling her it was extraordi∣nary
and significant, and desired her
that his Burial might be exactly ac∣cording
to it. On the <HI>Monday</HI> he pur∣chased
an House in the <HI>Almonry,</HI> and
the same day had the Writings Sealed
and the Money paid; and at night told
his dear Companion, that he had
bought that House on purpose near the
<HI>Abbey,</HI> that she might be near the
Church, and serve God after his Copy
and Example. And renewing the charge
to her, he went to Bed in as good bodi∣ly
health, as he had done before for
many years; but after his first sleep,
he found himself taken with a violent
Fever, occasioned (as was conceived by
his Physician) by eating of a little
<HI>Tansey</HI> at Supper. It seized him,
<PB N="283" REF="155"/>
<HI>May</HI> 1. 1662. and deprived him of his
understanding for seven days: the
eighth day he died; but for some hours
before had the use of his Faculties re∣stored
to him, telling one of the <HI>Vergers</HI>
of the Church, who came to him; <HI>I
know it is Church-time with you, and this is</HI>
As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ension-day, <HI>I am ascending to the
Church triumphant, I go to my God and
Saviour, into Ioys Celestial, and to Hal∣lelujahs
Eternal.</HI> He died in his great
<HI>Climacterical</HI> upon <HI>Ascension-day</HI> 1662.
when our Blessed Saviour <HI>entred into
his Glory,</HI> and as a Harbinger went to
