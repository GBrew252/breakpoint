<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT Worshipfull, my very good Friend, Sir THOMAS BARKER.</HEAD>
<P>SIR,</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> <HI>Send you here, an Answer to that Paper I re∣ceived from you; containing a col∣lection of cer∣taine Reasons, conveyed into the hands of some devout Gentlewo∣men your friends, with purpose to divert them from society with Pro∣testants,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>and specially in Gods ser∣vice established among us. Vp∣on the first view of them, I mar∣velled at the Authors strange drawing and misapplying Scri∣ptures to his purpose, &amp; at the opi∣nions which he imputed to ancient Hereticks, whereof, to my re∣membrance, I had never read nor heard before. But when I came to examine the places more particu∣larly in his owne Authors, I found cause even to be astonished at the boldnesse of the man, that taking advantage of the credulity of such good people, durst put such a pac∣ket of lies into their hands: And I could not but pitty their case, who being fallen into the net of errour,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>are by such a cunning, but ungod∣ly practise, in danger to be inwrap∣ed and snarled by this perswasion of separation, so as, if Gods mercy be not the more, there is no meanes for them to come ever even to un∣derstand this falshood, wherby their simplicity is abused. There is not a more approoved remedie against the stinging of a Scorpion, then the Scorpion it selfe bruised in oyle, and applyed. I have here endea∣voured to bray this Scorpion; it shall be your part to apply it. And if this Collector can and will justifie under his name his</HI> Do∣ctrine of Separation, <HI>and his</HI> Catalogue of Heresies, <HI>and his</HI> Charge of Protestants to

renew them, <HI>he shall proove himselfe an honest man: if he cannot, and will yeeld to the truth, at least a good Christian. If he doe not one of the two, request your friends (as our old Proverbe hath it) to let him con∣tinue in their</HI> Pater noster, <HI>but cast him, &amp; his</HI> additions to the Catholick faith, <HI>for ever out of their</HI> Creed. <HI>Concluding, I de∣sire God to give you and them a right understanding in all things, and to follow the truth in Charity; and rest</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN EXAMINATION of certaine Motives to RECVSANCIE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="position">
<Q>¶ <HI>Society with those of contrary Religion, hath alwaies been pernicious and unlawfull.</HI></Q>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His Assertion is ve∣ry <NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE> confusedly set downe. As it stands without limitation, it is utterly untrue; and besides, nothing to the purpose; For, society of such as are of a false religion with those of the true Religion, hath been often very profitable to them, al∣waies lawfull. And the Religion of the
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
reformed Churches is not a contrary religion to that of the Romane obedi∣ence, but onely different, as pure and corrupt, reformed and deformed.</P>
<P>For the discovery of the truth, the words and termes are to bee opened. This terme <HI>Religion,</HI> is not alwaies used in the same meaning: Sometime it is put for the perswasion of the minde and judgement, touching some divine nature, and the devotion of the heart toward the same: as the Iewish reli∣gion, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>.</HI> 26. 5. So religion of An∣gels, <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 18. sometimes it is put for some more speciall observance and ceremony, as the <HI>Religion of the Pas∣chall Lambe, Exod.</HI> 12. 26, 43. Accor∣ding to which sense, the rules of Saint <HI>Benedict,</HI> Saint <HI>Basill,</HI> and others have <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vulgat. edit. quae <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ista religi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>▪</NOTE> been called religions; although they had not a divers faith or perswasion touching God, nor yet a different wor∣ship in the substance, but onely in cir∣cumstances, as apparell, formes, and houres of praier, and such like. <HI>Con∣trary Religions</HI> therefore are such as have a <HI>contrary faith</HI> touching the God
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
they worship; as <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Laban, Gen. 31. Or a contrary manner of worshipping him in matter of substance.</HI> Circumstan∣ces and differences in opinions, go∣vernment and ceremonies, doe not make a diverse, much lesse a contrary religion; as appeares in the religion before and after the Law written, be∣fore and after Christ. These were dif∣ferent, as an infant, a childe, and a man of yeares, yet the same person.</P>
<P>As for the terme <HI>Society,</HI> it is like∣wise of divers sorts; one in the duties of religion, another in common life. Wherein againe some is <HI>necessary,</HI> and not at our choice and discretion, as the society of parents and children, ser∣vants and masters, subjects and prin∣ces, citizens, neighbours, kinsfolkes, passengers in the same ship, guests at the same table; yea, every man with another, in that hee is a man. Some againe is <HI>voluntary,</HI> and at pleasure, as of contracting marriage, friendship, fa∣miliarity, choosing our habitation and company with whom we will consort our selves. These explications premi∣sed,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
I answer in these five propositions.</P>
<P>First, <HI>society</HI> in the worship of God with true beleevers, professing pure <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> religion, is lawfull and necessary, and when it may be had, cannot long bee omitted without sin, <HI>Psal. 122. 1. I was glad when they said unto me, let us goe into the house of the Lord, Psal. 133. 1. Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity, Act.</HI> 2. 42, 44. The Christians of the primitive Church are said to have <HI>con∣tinued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in praiers, and were together: and Vers. 46. And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and brea∣king bread from house to house, did eate their meat with gladnesse, and singlenesse of heart. Heb. 10. 25. Not forsaking the assembling of our selves together, as the manner of some is.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>society</HI> with men that worship the true God, though in some <NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> points ignorant or misbeleevers, may be holden so long as they are not ob∣stinate, and God is not dishonoured:
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<HI>Act. 19. 9. Paul resorted to the Syna∣gogue of the Iewes,</HI> till they were hard∣ned, and blasphemed the way of the Lord, then hee <HI>separated the Disciples.</HI> See also 1. <HI>King.</HI> 8. 41. where <HI>Solomon</HI> praieth for the stranger that was not of Gods people Israel, but came out of a farre countrey, and should come and pray towards the Temple, that God would heare, and doe according to his request, that all the people of the earth might know his Name, to feare him as Israel did.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>society</HI> with men that wor∣ship <NOTE PLACE="marg">3</NOTE> a false God, or the true God with a false and Idolatrous worship in the exercise of their religion, is utterly un∣lawfull, <HI>Deut. 12. 30. Take heed to thy selfe, that thou bee not snared by follow∣ing them, after that they be destroyed from before thee, saying, how did these na∣tions serve their gods? even so will I doe likewise. Thou shalt not doe so unto the Lord thy God.</HI> How neer so ever they be; <HI>Deut. 13. 6, 7. If thy brother, the sonne of thy mother, or thy sonne, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosome, or</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<HI>thy friend, which is as thine owne soule, &amp;c.</HI> So <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. 27. The Levites are bidden by <HI>Moses</HI> from the Lord, to <HI>slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour,</HI> that had committed idolatry by worshipping God in the golden Calfe.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>civill society</HI> with men of a false religion, or wicked life, to <NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> whom we are necessarily bound by the Law of God, or man, must be holden, and cannot bee broken without sinne: as that of the <HI>subiect and the Prince, Rom.</HI> 13. <HI>the husband and the wife,</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 10. <HI>servant &amp; master,</HI> 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 18. yea, <HI>Iew &amp; Samaritane, Luk.</HI> 10. 37.</P>
<P>Fiftly, <HI>civill society,</HI> such as is un∣necessary with men of a false religion <NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> or wicked life, albeit sometimes it be turned to good, yet it is hazardous to the professours of the truth, as 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> 18. 31. and Chap. 19. 2. where <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> hardly escaping with his life, is thus reprooved, <HI>Shouldest thou helpe the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord?</HI> And <HI>Gen.</HI> 19. 15.
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<HI>Lot</HI> is sent out of <HI>Sodome</HI> in haste, with this terrour, <HI>Lest thou be consumed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the city.</HI> And <HI>Peter,</HI> while he would associate himselfe with the servants of the high Priest need∣lesly, fell into the snare of the Devill, and denied his master, <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. 58. 70. And 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 27. <HI>If any of them that beleeve not b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> you to a feast, and ye will goe, &amp;c.</HI> Hee doth not absolutely forbid it, but implies the danger in go∣ing to the feasts of Idolaters. And 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 14. expresly forbids enter∣marrying with such▪ <HI>Bee not unequally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with unbele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>vers, &amp;c.</HI> But let us examine his proofes.</P>

<Q><HI>The professours of true religion did so farre avoid the followers of er∣rours,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Object. 2.</NOTE> <HI>that they would not after their death bee buried in the same Church-yard; therefore</HI> Abraham <HI>bought a speciall place for the buri∣all of</HI> Sara <HI>and himselfe, Gen.</HI> 23. 20.</Q>

<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<P>THe professours of true religion ne∣ver <NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer.</NOTE> esteemed much where their bodies were buried after death, as be∣ing assured, whatsoever became of them, they should have a glorious re∣surrection. Neither were there in <HI>A∣brahams</HI> time, Churches or Church-yards to be buried in, nor was it the use to be buried all in one place; every man was buried in his owne possession: So that the burying of <HI>Sara,</HI> in a field pur∣chased by <HI>Abraham,</HI> is very fondly
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
attributed to a desire of separation from the Canaanites. <HI>Abraham</HI> had not till then a foot of land in the coun∣trey. And whereas <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Ioseph</HI> gave charge of their buriall in the land of Canaan, it was to confirme their po∣sterity in the faith of Gods promise, that he would give it them for an inhe∣ritance, <HI>Gen.</HI> 50. 25.</P>

<P>Thirdly, his maintaining, that while we live, we may pray mutually each

<HI>they are present.

<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
within the first foure hundred years after Christ. Which that it may the better appeare, I will set downe the doctrine that sounds in our Chur∣ches, touching these points.</P>
<P>First, we teach, that a sinner truly penitent for all his sinnes, and resting <NOTE PLACE="marg">I.</NOTE> by faith upon the Redemption that is in Christ Iesus, is by that faith alone <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 3. 24. 28.</NOTE> freely justified, without the workes of the Law. Notwithstanding, true faith worketh by charity, and sheweth it selfe by good workes, which God doth account for righteous, and re∣ward farre beyond desert.</P>
<P>Secondly, that Baptisme is a Sacra∣ment, appointed by Christ our <NOTE PLACE="marg">II.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 22. 16. Col. 2. 12. Rom. 4. 11, 20.</NOTE> Lord, to wash away sinne, and in stead of Circumcision, to be a seale of the righteousnesse of faith. And that none despising this Sacrament, can be saved. Yet they are not wholly to be excluded from the mer∣cy of God, who by the straits of
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>
time, not by the will of their Parents are deprived thereof; for they may <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 11. 16. <HI>See Saint</HI> Ambrose orat. de obi∣tu valent. &amp; S. Aug. de Bapt. cont. Don. l. 4. c. 22. &amp; 25.</NOTE> have the baptisme of the Spirit, though not of Water: as those cate∣chised in the Christian faith, that suf∣fered martyrdome sometimes before outward Baptisme.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that in the state of this <NOTE PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE> present life, it is impossible to keep Gods Commandements to <HI>perfection,</HI> according to the Law; but not to <HI>ac∣ceptation,</HI> when we are in Christ.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that the gate of mercy is <NOTE PLACE="marg">IV.</NOTE> not to be shut against any sinner; peni∣tently desiring reconciliation, but he is to be admitted to the same, private∣ly or publikly.</P>
<P>Fiftly, that Praiers are to be made <NOTE PLACE="marg">V.</NOTE> for all that are departed in the true faith of Christ; that is, first, <HI>Thankes∣giving,</HI> that they are delivered from the body of death, and miseries of this sinfull world. Secondly, <HI>Requests</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>
of Gods mercy, that they may have their perfect consummation and blisse in body and soule, in the kingdome of God, at the last judgment.</P>
<P>Sixtly, that Virginity, such as the <NOTE PLACE="marg">VI.</NOTE> Apostle describeth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 34, 37. holy in body and spirit, and underta∣ken to be free from the cares of this world, to be carefull for the things that pertaine to the Lord, is a more excellent estate then marriage.</P>
<P>Seventhly, that the Saints in hea∣ven <NOTE PLACE="marg">VII.</NOTE> pray for the Church on earth; and it is lawfull for us to pray to God to heare their praiers: but they know not our hearts; neither may we aske grace or glory of any but God onely.</P>

<PB N="53" REF="30"/>
with incense, vowes, or praiers.</P>

<P>Did the <HI>Councell</HI> then forbid that which God commands? Did Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> consent to it? I think not. But the Author of this Collection, whether wittingly or ignorantly, God knowes, goeth about to beguile the
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>
simple with a cunning Translation, and wrong application of this Canon, to make feare where there is no feare.</P>
<P>The word which he Englisheth, <HI>To sing Psalmes,</HI> is more generall, <HI>To sing</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psallere.</NOTE> <HI>any Ditty or Song,</HI> whether it be out of the Book of <HI>Psalmes,</HI> as we doe use the terme, or composed by any other Author.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Psalmes</HI> had the Hereticks in their assemblies, both the <HI>Arrians,</HI> and the <HI>Donatists;</HI> wherein they inser∣ted <NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>zomen l. 8 c. 8.</NOTE> such things, as made to the advan∣cing of their owne Sect; yea, as tended to increase contention: which mooved Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> at <HI>Milane,</HI> and by their example many other Churches in the world, to take up the like use of singing also, besides the <HI>Psalmes</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> which long before were wont to be sung in the Church.</P>
<P>The Churches in <HI>Africk</HI> were more slack herein, as Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. confes. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 9. c. 7.</NOTE> relateth; so as the <HI>Donatists</HI> blamed

<P>And thus did Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.

<HI>songs</HI> of <HI>Arrians</HI> and <HI>Donatist,</HI> and the sacred <HI>Psalmes</HI> of the <HI>Pro∣phets.</HI></P>
<P>And for the application of this <HI>Ca∣non,</HI> to the reformed Churches, judge whether there be no ods betweene the assemblies of true Catholick, and charitable Christians, and the Con∣venticles of desperate Hereticks, and cut-throats, denying the Lord that bought them, or the Catholick Church that brought them forth, con∣fining it to <HI>Africk,</HI> (as some doe now to <HI>Rome)</HI> re-baptizing those that come from others to them, burning Church∣es and the holy Scriptures, ris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing hou∣ses, pulling out the eyes, cutting out the tongues, and off the hands of those that dissented from their madnesse, and setting upon them by the high∣waies, to kill or to be killed, upon hope of becomming Martyrs.

amongst the <HI>Grisons;</HI> or, not to goe so farre, of our Powder Traitors here in <HI>England,</HI> and generally of the Romish, then the <HI>reformed Ca∣tholicks.</HI></P>
<P>Iudge againe whether that be like∣ly to be true which the Author of this Collection would perswade by his wresting the Scriptures, forgeing and framing to his purpose the opini∣ons of ancient hereticks, slandring his even-Christians, making them to hold that, which it is marvell if his owne conscience did not tell him is otherwise. Whether it be likely to be a Sect, which as himselfe ob∣serves, is different from all Sects, in that according to another <HI>Canon</HI> of the selfe same <HI>Councell</HI> which he cites, it <HI>prohibites none to come into the Church and heare Gods Word, Gen∣tile, Heretick, or Iew; at least, till such be dismissed as receive not the Commu∣nion.</HI></P>

<HI>approoves that which is right, gives what is lacking, acknowledges what is present:</HI> according to the Apostles precept, <HI>Followes peace with all that call upon the Name of the Lord.</HI></P>
