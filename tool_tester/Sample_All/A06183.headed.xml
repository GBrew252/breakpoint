Of late daies knowing that his grandfather determines to keepe graund Christmasses in hel, he hath insinuated himselfe into the city in these kind of furnitures &amp; apparitions, to prouide him store of fuell to furnish Sathans house of Distresse, and common place of Confusion. In Powls hée walketh like a gallant Courtier, where, if hée méet some rich chuffes worth the gulling, at euery word he speaketh, hée makes a mouse of an elephant, he telleth them of wonders done in <HI>Spaine</HI> by his ancestors: where, if the matter were well examined, his father was but Swabber in the ship where Ciuill Oranges were the best merchandize: draw him into the line of history, you shall heare as many lies at a breath, as would breed scruple in a good conscience for an age: talke with him of trauels, ware thirty thousand crownes in eggeshels at a <HI>Venetian</HI> banquet: if any worthy exploit, rare stratageme, plausible pollicie, hath euer past his hearing, hée maketh it his owne by an oath: nay, to speake the whole pith of his commendations, truths are as rare in his mouth, as a∣dulteries in <HI>Sparta.</HI> Touch me his hat, it was giuen him by <HI>Henry</HI> the second of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> when hée kist the <HI>Reintgraues</HI> wife at his going into <HI>Almaine:</HI> commend the fashion of his beard, hée tels you it is the worke of a Turkish barber: his band was a prize gotten in <HI>Transiluania;</HI> where the truth is, he bought it in the Exchange for his mony: <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour gaue his cloake: his sword was <HI>Mountdragons,</HI> all that hée hath if you beléeue him, are but gifts in reward of his vertue: where (poore asse as he is) were hée examined in his owne nature, his courage is boasting, his learning ignorance, his ability weak∣nesse, and his end beggery: yet is his smooth tongue a fit bait to catch Gudgeons; and such as saile by the wind of his good fortune, become Camelions like <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> féeding on the va∣nity of his tongue with the foolish credulity of their eares.

Beware of this Deuill friends, for if you make him a souldier, you shall find a false heart, or howsoeuer you thinke him, a very ideot.

If you desire commodities at his hand, why sir you shall haue them, but how? not (as the caterpillers wont to sell) at high prises, but as the best and easiest penyworth, as in con∣science you can desire them: only this, at the insealing of the assurance, if you helpe him away with a chest of glasse for ten pound of ten shillings price, you shall command his warehouse another time. Tut he is for you at casuall marts, commodities of Proclamations, and hobby-horses, you shall haue all that you please, so hée receiue what he desires. It is a common cu∣stome of his to buy vp crackt angels at nine shillings the piece. Now sir if a gentleman (on good assurance of land) request him of mony, Good sir, (saith hée, with a counterfait sigh) I would be glad to please your worship, but my good mony is abroad, and that I haue, I dare not put in your hands. The gentleman thinking this conscience, where it is subtilty, and being beside that, in some necessity, ventures on the crackt angels, some of which can not flie for soldering, and paies double interest to the miser, vnder the cloake of honesty. If he failes his day, God forbid he should take the forfaiture, hée will not thriue by other mens curses, but because men must liue, and we are Infidels if we prouide not for our families, hée is content with this his owne; only a lease, a toy, of this or that manor, worth both his principall and ten times the interest, this is easie for the gen∣tleman to pay, and reasonable in him to receiue. If a citizen come to borrow, my friend, quoth he, you must keepe day, I am glad to helpe young men without harming my selfe: then paying him out the mony and receiuing his assurance, he casts Iolly Robbins in his head how to cousin the simple fellow.

who had seuentie Quienes and thrée hundreth concubines, so that euen in his age his heart was depraued: and whereas in al other sinnes their venome is not contracted by societie, in lust a man by conuersation may be corrupted: so that neither the wise mans wit, neither the strong mans armes, nor the holy mans meditation is defenced against lust, but as <HI>Ierome</HI> saith, <HI>ad Paulum &amp; Eus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ochaim, Ferreas mentes libido domat,</HI></P>
<P>Lust conquereth the most vntamed minds. As soon saith <HI>Grego∣rie,</HI> as lust hath possessiō of the mind, it scarsly suffereth it to con∣ceiue any good desires, and in that the desires therof are vicious by the suggestion thereof riseth corrupt thought, and of thought the like affection, &amp; of affection delèctation, &amp; of delight consent, &amp; of cōsent operation, &amp; of operatiō custome, &amp; of custome despe∣ration, and of desperation, defence of sinne and glorieng there∣in, and of glorying in sinne, damnation. Lururious men haue outwardly the Deuill suggesting them; and inwardly concupis∣cence incensing them; and of these two, al carnal sinn̄es are be∣gotten. It is likewise to be noted, that the word of God, is two waies indemnified by lasciuious men, the one way is <HI>conculcator a transeuntibus,</HI> It is troden downe by them as they passe by it: This treading downe and oppression of the word of God, is the custome of euill thoughts, whereby the Gospell is oppressed: The second is, that it is deuoured of birds; which deuouring is the suggestion of the Deuill. Against these defects there are likewise two remedies, the first is, that we fence in the inclo∣sure of our hearts, with the thornes of the memorie of the passi∣on of Christ, according to that of the wise man, <HI><HI>Popule sepi aures</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 28.</NOTE> <HI>tuas spinis.</HI></HI> For there is no greater remedie saith <HI>Origen,</HI> nor bet∣ter means against euill cogitations, then the remembrance of Christs passion. The second remedie is, to fatten this inclosure of our hearts with the vertue of charitie; for of it it is said, That it couereth the multitude of sinnes. To conclude a sea of mat∣ter in a short circle of admonition, refraine lust and her proge∣nie for these causes, First it destroieth the infused graces of God, and the gifts of the holie ghost: Secondly, it consumeth the foure cardinall vertues: Thirdly, it weakeneth the body, in∣féebleth the spirit, and hardeneth the heart against all deuotion.

<P>A great and mighty Lord desirous to know the difference be∣twixt an enuious &amp; couetous man commāded a seruant of his to bring one of both sorts to his presence: to whom (after some courtly salutations) he made this offer, that aske what they would he would grant it them, on that condition, that he might giue the second the double of that the first demanded: these two vnderstanding the summe of the Noblemans intent, fell at de∣bate betwixt themselues which of them should wish first; the couetous, desiring to wish last, by reason of the commoditie de∣pending thereon, and the enuious disdaining the other should haue more then he. At last the Nobleman séeing their contenti∣on without end, &amp; desirous to sée the issue of his expectation, cō∣manded the enuious to begin, reseruing the couetous the latter choice; But what desired he thinke you, being preferred to this election? Forsooth, nought els but that one of his eies might bée pulled out, to the end the other might loose both his, chusing ra∣ther the losse then the profit, to the end that he whom he enui∣ed might haue mischiefe with the aduantage: whereby wée may easilie vnderstand, in what blindnesse and error that miserable man is, that suffereth himselfe to bée conque∣red by this cursed humor: to conclude with <HI>Iob,</HI> this sort<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 5.</NOTE> of maligning enuie killeth a foole, I wish therefore that all wise men should flie it.</P>

if his purge worke not presently; and kill his horse, if he gallop not when he commands him: he is like captaine <HI>Cloux</HI> foole of Lyons that would néeds die of the sullens, because his master would entertaine a new foole besides himselfe: this deuill is an arrant swearer, a swift striker, a short liuer, thrée good marks to know him by, and of all his imperfections this is not the least, that if he be detracted he stormeth, be it either iustly or vniustly, not considering what an honour it was for <HI>Zerxes, Caesar, Domitian, Titus, Traian,</HI> and <HI>Tiberius,</HI> who being certifi∣ed that a certaine man had spoken ill of him, answered, That tongues are frée in a city. For to heare a mans fault is wis∣dome, but to be flattered is méere misery. A certaine Empe∣rour confirming the lawes of <HI>Theodosius, Arcadius,</HI> and of <HI>Homer,</HI> said thus: If any one not knowing the law of mode∣sty, so far forth forget himselfe to speake ill of vs, our will is, that he be not punished for the same, for if it procéed of lightnesse of spirit, and readinesse of tongue, it is to be neglected: if it pro∣céed of folly or choller, it is to be pitied: and if it procéed of iniu∣ry, it is to be pardoned: A golden saying, and worthy an Empe∣rour, which if you follow my friends, you haue a sufficient spell about you, to coniure the spirit of Impatience from you. Thus haue I briefly shewed you the whelpes of <HI>Wrathes</HI> lit∣ter: now for a conclusion, let vs a litle canuase this cursed fiend <HI>Baalberith.</HI> To discourse therefore of this immoderate passion (procéeding from the sensetiue appetite, as <HI>Aquine</HI> saith) it is the increase of the gall (according to the Phisitians) but the decrease of all modesty, by the law of reason: for he that is af∣fected with this short madnesse (according to <HI>Seneca</HI>) is angry with his quill if it deliuer not inke; with his dice, if he play and loose, and then he bites them: his gesture is inconstant, he looks red in the gils like a Turkie cocke, his eie lids are deprest, his lips tremble, his tongue stutters, and he is vnquiet in all his body.

What shall I say? this Deuill in all men darkeneth reason, &amp; confoundeth memory: and as smoke drweth a man out of his house, so wrath erpelleth the Holy-Ghost from our hearts. Those that write of Ire, disswade and debar men from the vse thereof for thrée causes: First, because it iniureth God; next, their neighbours; and lastly themselues. For from God it taketh the effect of his power; from our neighbour it taketh the affect of due beneuolence; and from mens selues it taketh the aspect of reason and vse of intelligence.

But the Irefull man is contrari∣ous to God in all these things: first, hée taketh from God his reuenge, because Ire is a disordinate appetite of reuenge: and God saith, <HI>To me belongeth reuenge, <HI>Et ipse retribuum,</HI></HI> For God<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.</NOTE> hath reserued two things vnto himselfe, glory, &amp; reuenge; and the proud man robbeth him of the one, and the irefull man of the other: secondly, an Irefull man iniureth God, because he ex∣pelleth him from the rest of his habitation: <HI><HI>In pace factus est locus eius,</HI> His place is made in peace:</HI> but according to the Prouerbs, <HI>An Irefull man prouoketh brawles, <HI>erga</HI></HI> he displaceth God of that habitation wherein hée would dwell, by corrupting his heart with contentions: thirdly, God is iniuried, in that the peace he sent into the world, is by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>refull man disturbed.

That it destroieth the honesty and comelinesse of mans disposition, it appeareth, because how faire soeuer a man be, it deformeth his lookes, it discōlours his face, it altereth his gesture, it transpor∣teth his tongue, and euery way disgraceth him. And therefore <HI>Seneca</HI> faith▪ Nothing more profiteth an Irefull man then to behold his owne deformity: and therefore another Philosopher said, that it was requisite for a wrathfull man to sée his owne face in a myrrour, to the end, that by the reflexion thereof, hée might behold his unnaturall alteration. It is said of <HI>Minerua,</HI> that being delighted in the musicke of a cornet, she once plaid by a transparant and christall fountaines side, wherein spying her chéekes mightily puft and swollen with winding, shee cast away her instrument, and repined the further vse of it: As it happened to <HI>Minerua</HI> the goddesse of wit, so fortuneth it often times to many wise men subiect to indignation, who somtimes distracted with Ire, and perceiuing in the cléere fountaine of their iudgement, the vndecencie and errour thereof, vtterly disclaim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>: secondly wrath hindreth the power of reason, ac∣cording to Catos saying:
<Q><L>Impedit ingenium ne possit cernere verum,</L></Q>
<HI>It hindreth the iudgement and vnderstanding, least it should dis∣cerne truth:</HI> and for that cause the Deuill behaueth himselfe like a cunning fisherman, who purposing to catch and insuare the fish more cunningly, troubleth the waters, to the end, that blin∣ding their sight, they may the sooner fall in his net. In like man∣ner doth the Deuill demeane himselfe, who striuing to draw men to sinne, hee stirreth perturbation, strife, and dissentious among them, to the end they may the sooner fall into sinne, and be seduced by his mallice. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in the first of his Topiques saith, that Ire neuer subuerteth reason, but when the mind and soule is peruerse and froward: and euen as it is the craft of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> Sophister (as the same Philosopher saith) to prouoke his aduer∣sary to Ire, to the end he may hinder his iudgement, so it is the

pollicte of the Deuill to blind our vnderstanding with wrath, least we would discerne his villany: thirdly, Ire shorteneth life, as may appeare in beasts, which being naturally chollericke, haue but short time of continuance; as namely, in the dog, and that in <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> it is approoued, where it is said, <HI><HI>Zelus &amp; ira∣cundia minuent dies, &amp; ante tempus senectam adducent,</HI> Zeale and wrath shorten life, end hasten age.</HI> It is said of the Duyr (a stone gathered in India and Arabia) that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ieth spirits, presenteth dolefull visions, multiplieth strife, &amp; causeth brawles: The like may be said of Wrath, for it banisheth all good thoughts from the heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lleth the imagination with vntoward visions, and increaseth enuy, wrong, and contention: and as the stone <HI>Sar∣dius</HI> hindreth the properties thereof, so doth Patience mollifie &amp; pacifie trouble: according to that of the Wise man, <HI><HI>Responsio mollis frangit iram,</HI> A soft answer putteth downe strife.

and litle will in such sort créepe and attaine to the feiguurie of the heart, that by no meanes or medicine it will be vuseated therefrom. The heauen (said <HI>Gallen</HI>) hath so much fauoured me, that I had a iust, good, and courteous father, &amp; no waies oppres∣sed with passion and choller; whose good precepts and instru∣ctions, I haue euer retained: for at no time, in what choller so∣euer he hath béene, haue I séene him transported so farre, as to strike any man, but (which more is) hée had alwaies a custome to reprehend those, that beat and stroke their subiects and ser∣uants. But if I were fortunate in a father (said he) I was lesse fortunate in a mother, for I had one the most chollericke and troublesome woman liuing vpon the earth, shée was alwaies at the staffes end with my father, to whome shée was no lesse troublesome, then was earst <HI>Xantippe</HI> to her <HI>Socrates:</HI> she ne∣uer ceased to raile against him, continually filling the house w<SUP>t</SUP> tumult, yea, choller had such power in her from her youth, that when she entred into any discontents, she finng, stampt, strooke, yea so far forgot her selfe, that she strooke her chambermaids. The same author saith like wise, that the first time he began to detest that vice, was, that being a young lad he beheld a man seased with this passion, who was so far disguised by choller, that hée séemed rather a monster then a man, for hée had his countenance changed, his eies staring, his haires bristling on his head, his lookes furious, and all the rest of his body trem∣bling, and agitated with fury; he cried, he stamped, he threatned, he fomed at the mouth like a bore, and to conclude, he shewed such strange, insolent, and prodigious countenauces, that hée gaue manifest euidence that this brutall passion, brings a man besides himselfe, and makes him like vnto beasts. Thus farre <HI>Gallen,</HI> by whose counsell if wée propose vnto our selues the image and picture of a distempered and wrathfull man, no doubt but the obscene, filthy, and lothsome behauiour which he vseth, will bring vs in detestation of his vice, and determination to a∣uoid and conquer such like perturbations and affections.</P>

<P>It resteth now (according to course) that I speake some∣what of the deformity of <HI>Beelphogor</HI> the father, since I haue in part scored out the vncleannesse of his children. Gluttony (as the Schoolemen write) is (both according to the habitude and act) a disordinate delight in eating and drinking, a mortall enemy of the vertue of temperance; of∣fending both in quantity, quality, time, and manner. It was first introduced from Asia into Rome, where (corruptions commonly being the swiftest in springing) it became from a seruile thing, the delight of the soueraignes: so that <HI>Apicius</HI> (an abiect cooke that profest the art of cookery in the kitchin) was not ashamed afterward to step into the schoole, and declaime in praise of it, whome for his insatiable abuses and inuentions, <HI>Pliny</HI> (and that rightly) called the Gulfe of prodigality. To this sinne <HI>Milo Crotoniates</HI> and <HI>Tagon</HI> (the belly-ged) were so addi∣cted, that the one bare an Oxe on his shoulders, and after de∣noured it; and the other (at the table of <HI>Autelian</HI> the Emperor) eat a Goat, a Hog, and drunke a Tierse of wine, and far more in boast of his intemperance. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>boinus</HI> and <HI>Maximinus</HI> Empe∣rours, yéelding nothing in sensuality to this; for y<SUP>e</SUP> one deuoured at a supper an hundred Peaches, ten Pepins, fiue hundred figs, beside diuers other things: the other, in one day eat forty pound

And now a daies our world rather superior then infe∣riour to other ages, in these kind of infirmities, neglecteth no∣thing in sensuality: our bankets are sauced with surfets, so that <HI>Beelphogor</HI> may (I feare me) claime as many followers and fautors in our age, as either he had in Persia, Rome, or Media: for our bankets excéed nature, and where our fathers were con∣tent with bread and water, which at first nourished mans life after the creation of the world: now neither the fruit of trées, nor the variety of corne, nor the roots of hearbs, nor the fishes of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t.</NOTE> the sea, nor the beaste of the earth, nor the foules of the aire, can satisfie our intemperance: but (as <HI>Innocentius</HI> saith) paintings are sought for, spices are bought, foules are nourished, &amp; cookes hired, to please appetite: one stampes and straines, another in∣fuseth and maketh confections; turning the substance into the accident, and nature into art. For which cause <HI>Seneca</HI> (deriding the variety of banquets) saith, <HI><HI>Vna s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lua pluribus Elephantibus suf∣ficit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. 8.</NOTE> <HI>homo vero pascitur terra &amp; mari.</HI> One wood sussiseth to nou∣rish diuers Elephants, but man feedeth both on sea and earth.</HI> And in his tenth booke of his Declamations, he saith, <HI>Whatsoeuer bird flieth, whatsoeuer fish swimmeth, whatsoeuer beast runneth, is buried in our bodies:</HI> all which in the truth of things is both a∣gainst nature and Art: for both Art and nature, forbiddeth that contraries should be mixt togither: which not withstanding in our festiuals are often done.

<PB N="92" REF="50"/>
mans body by continuall sicknes, and at last bringeth cruell death. <HI>Galen</HI> (the interpreter of <HI>Hypocrates</HI>) saith, That they that are grossesed, can not be long time healthfull: concluding, that those soules can not meditate or conceiue celestiall things, whose bodies are ouergrowen with blood, flesh, and fat. It is re∣ported of <HI>Dionysius</HI> the tirant, that being too much swallowed vp by surfet and drunkennesse, he lost his eie sight; for there is nothing sooner dulleth the eie, then excesse: because (as <HI>Portu∣minus</HI> saith) <HI><HI>Edacitas cibos terit, sed oculos v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>rat,</HI> Gluttony spendeth meat, but deuoureth the eies. Macrobius</HI> in his Saturnals, pro∣poseth a very prety and disputable question; namely, whether vniforme and simple meat, be better and easier of digestion, then diuers and different? and to this a certaine Philosopher answereth, that diuers and different meat is the hardest of dige∣stion for these causes: first it appeareth in beasts, which be∣cause they féed on a simple and pure nutriment, are most helth∣full; and if any of them be diseased, it is when by variety of medicine and mans folly, they are nourished against the course of their nature: secondly, because all simple meat is more easily digested, in signe whereof, euery Phisitian recouereth and mi∣nistreth to his patient in one kind of food, that nature may more easily conuert the simple meat into her selfe: thirdly, because as the variety of wine, hurteth more then one sort of wine in the same quantity, in like sort doth the variety of meat: fourthly, because he that obserueth one kind of simple diet, may more ea∣sily iudge and gesse at the cause of his infirmitie (if at any time he féele himselfe distempered) and consequently can more easily auoid such kind of food: whereas if hée should haue vsed diuers, he should vtterly be ignorant, to which of many he should im∣pute the cause of his sicknesse: fistly, because in the stomacke, the nature of diuers meats is very different, therefore (nature working vniformitie for her owne part) certaine are sooner di∣gested then other, (the rest remaining in the stomacke being crude) and consequently that r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ts which is afterwards to be di∣gested: by which reasons it followeth, that these rich men v∣sing diuers kind of dishes, do by that means shorten their owne liues. But perhaps to particularize diseases will be held more

forcible argumenes, I will therefore tell you what infirmi∣ties surfet bréedeth. First (as <HI>Auicen</HI> saith) it hindreth the braine, the liuer, and the nerues, it causeth conuulsions, sown∣dings, Epilepsies, the falling sicknesse, and the palsey: it ingen∣ders the lamenesse in the legges, the gout, the Sciatica, the A∣poplexie, and a thousand defluxions, cathars, and crudities of the stomacke, which procéed from nought els, but from the insa∣tiable desire of drinking and eating. All philosophie will con∣fesse vnto me, that the more a man stuffes and chargeth his sto∣macke, the more he gréeueth it; for first of all it is necessary that he surmount and excéed the nutriment and meat, and digest it also; and in the surmounting he must striue, and in striuing he wearieth himselfe, and in wearying himselfe he waxeth féeble, and in waxing féeble he finally consumeth, and then his cooke (I meane his stomacke) vnable to worke or boile, it followeth of necessity that he must die. But leaue we this to Phisitians to decide, and like Christians let vs learne to say with <HI>Seneca</HI> (though a Pagan) <HI><HI>Maius sum, &amp; ad maiora natus sum, quam vt fiam mancipium corporis mei,</HI> I am greater, and borne to greater things, then to become the bondslaue of mine owne body.</HI> Brief∣ly, (since according to <HI>Augustine</HI>) Gluttony marcheth neuer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. de b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> but accompanied with other vices: and (in his fourth booke <HI>ad Sacras virgines</HI>) since Ebrietie is the mother of all vice, the trou∣ble of the head, the subuersion of the sense, the tempest of the tongue, the storme of the body, the shipwracke of sanctity, and the soule; let vs conquer this monster by our abstinence, liuing according to the examples of <HI>Paul,</HI> the first Hermite <HI>Hilarius, Macharius,</HI> and others; that that saying may be truly verified in vs, that <HI><HI>In carne esse, &amp;c.</HI> To be in the flesh and not to liue after the flesh, is rather the life of Angels then men.</HI> And thus far for <HI>Gluttony</HI> and <HI>Beelphogor,</HI> whome (I hope) I haue so coniured, as he shall haue little welcome to those that haue any sparke of piety: the vantgard and battell are already discoinsited, now <HI>Astaroth</HI> looke to your rereward, for I assure my selfe to dis∣comfit you.</P>

for, he shipt in a Brasile man for Ciuill, but the ship being vn∣fortunately taken by an English man, they were brought into England, and no sooner set foot on land, but ran away from their Captaine. Now sir, hauing all languages perfectly, they follow strange directions, not tying their spirits to one determinate body, but flying here and there, and infecting all places, and ex∣empting themselues from no persons: yet as subtill as they are, I haue sounded them out; and that I know them, I will resolue you if you please to read their descriptions. The eldest of them <HI>Desperation</HI> (a peculiar vice procéeding frō <HI>Idlenes,</HI> but not y<SUP>•</SUP> which is the sin against the Holy-ghost,) is such a sin, that if he méet w<SUP>t</SUP> a rich man, he makes him distrust himselfe for get∣ting vp on his horse without helpe; he causeth him forbeare the reading of bookes in suspect of his vnderstanding, he driues him to be dainty of his meats, telling him his stomack is squeasie; he féedeth him in his dreams with terrible visions, he driues him to mistrust himselfe in whatsoeuer he pretendeth, inforcing such a diffidence in himselfe, that both he maketh him an enemy to his body, and the ruine of his owne soule. He perswades the Mer∣chant not to traffique, because it is giuen him in his natiuity to haue losse by sea; and not to lend, least he neuer receiue againe. He makes the Scholler loath to read bookes if they be long, carelesse to heare lectures, because he vnderstands not at the first. He causeth a louer to lie sighing in his bed, and rather die sicke of the sullens then tell his griefe. The poore man he tea∣cheth to curse his birth, and desperately to giue ouer labour, where otherwise if he would shew diligence, he might be relie∣ued. He tels a Lady it is best kéeping her bed, when the Phisi∣tians assure her the disease is cured with exercise: and let him but light on a séeble heart, he will die first before he take a medi∣cine. If a friend intreateth his friend to speake in his behalfe, out steps he, and counsels him to forbeare the demand, for feare he be denied: and if a husband man haue a good crop, in the midst of his haruest hée teacheth him this tetch of vnthanke∣fulnesse, I would I were a beast, so I were rid of this trouble.

and plausible? Is not his perswasion conformable to weake na∣ture? If you say nay, you erre; if you confesse it, then learne thus to preuent him: First, remember that <HI><HI>Volenti nihil diffici∣le,</HI> A good will winneth all things:</HI> and to condemne our owne abilitie in good things, is to suspect Gods mercifull prouidence in furtherance of iustice and vertue: obserue that lesson in <HI>Se∣neca,</HI>
<Q><L>Qui nihil potest sperare, desperet nihil.</L><L>Who nothing hopes, let him despaire in nought.</L></Q>

Let the rich know this, that he that feareth a litle frost of infir∣mity, shall haue a great snow fall vpon him: let him consider, that to helpe nature, winneth ease; and that to endeauour wil∣lingly, is halfe the meane to attaine happily: let him remem∣ber this, that God openeth the vnderstanding, if we offer the endeauour; and commanding vs temperance, killeth the feare of ercesse; and being all in all things, is defectiue in nothing that is vertuous. Let the superstitious Merchant trust the cre∣ator, and he shall not superstitiously be tied to creatures; and succour his neighbours necessities with good intent, and God shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eward him. Let the scholler know, that the harder he is to conceiue, the surer he is to retaine: and as no way is too long to him that séeketh a place desired; so no booke can be too tedious that le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s any path to knowledge. Let the poore labour to pre∣uent néed, and he may be assured to find no cause to suspect ne∣cessities. Let the Lady fast in continence, she shall not languish in excesse: and let all men build on God, and desperation shall not hurt them.

<Q><L>Magna tamen spes est in bonitate dei,</L><L>Yet in Gods goodnesse is our hope increast.</L></Q>
<P>The second furie (now adaies ranging vp and downe our countrie, and infecting fraile and inconstant hearts) is <HI>Pusaila∣nimitie</HI> and <HI>Worldlie feare,</HI> who (wheresoeuer he lurketh,) is knowne by these tokens; hée maketh the eie inconstant, the co∣lour come and goe, the heart beat, the thought suspitious, he kils weake desire, by suspitious feares; and as a little water (as <HI>A∣ristotle</HI> saith) is sooner corrupted then a great deale; so with this abastardizing spirit, the weaker minds are sooner attainted thē the great. This fiend maketh easie thinges impossible by mi∣strust, and so transporteth affections that they can claime no ti∣tle in their owne natures. This is a temporall and foolish kind of feare, rising either from the loue of transitorie things, or the supposed difficulties of life. The ordinarie seate of this humor is in the sensualitie of the heart: With this weaknesse of spirit was <HI>Anthonie</HI> the Romane seasd, who séeing the increases of <HI>Caesar,</HI> when his meanes of resist were sufficient, retired him∣selfe to his Timoneum, leauing both <HI>Cleopatra</HI> and his busines, as destitute of all hope, before the assurance of his danger: mor∣tall is this sinne if it bée accompanied with the consent of the will, the Apostle writing to the Colossians saith, Fathers pro∣uoke not your children vnto indignation, least they become weake in mind, and loose their courage, (according to the Syriak:) noting hereby, that this infirmitie accompanieth for the most part those that are of the weakest abilitie and Iudge∣ment. This deiection of spirit likewise is an effeminate and womanish disease, expressed often by foolish huswifes in those words, Good God what shal I do? How shal I dresse my house?

easie and rediculons to bée forced. Against this infirmitie, and inue noming spirit of feare, I will applie that of <HI>Doctor Ger∣son,</HI> where hée sayth, That there are diuers that thinke they of∣fend by dispaire, which offend not: For this procéedeth from a certaine Pusillanunitie of their hearts, or of emotiue or fée∣ling of dispaire, which they estéeme to bée a consent, but it is not. For whatsoeuer féeling they may haue, (yea, although it presse so farre as that they thinke themselues almost attainted with this temptation) they lose not charitie, as long as they are sorrowfull, and the reason is contrarie and consenteth not thereto: So that the spirit of a man is ouercome by the ene∣mie, except there bée consent of the will: For the seuce maketh not the sinne, but the consent. You that are or may happen to bée intangled in these briars, and assailed by this temptation, make your generall recourse to God, saying with the Apostle, <HI><HI>Omnia possum in co qui me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> I can doe al things by the grace of him that comforteth mee.</HI> To conclude, let no man hide his Talent whatsoeuer, which God hath bestowed on him to trafficke and profite his neighbour, least hée incurre this vice of <HI>Pusillanimitie;</HI> but let vs all cleaue vnto <HI>Magnanimi∣tie</HI> his opposite, considering this of <HI>Tullies, <HI>Qui magno animo est &amp; forti; omnia quae cadore in hominem possunt de∣sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>cit, &amp; pro nihiloputas.</HI> Hee that hath a noble and resolute mind, despiseth all miisfortunes that are incident to man, holding them of no reckoning.</HI> And that of <HI>Lucans,</HI></P>

<P><HI>Dulnesse of spirit</HI> (the next borne to <HI>Pusillanimitie</HI>) hath great conformitie with him, for <HI>Pusillanimitie</HI> hinders the beginning and enterprise of a good worke, and this fiend letteth the per∣formance of it whe it is begun, &amp; maketh a man giue ouer in the midst of his busines. This monster hath thrée heads whersoeuer
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>
he seaseth one body: the first is <HI>Idlenesse,</HI> (slack to performe any thing, and a poison that confoundeth many men;) the second is <HI>Slownesse,</HI> that deserreth to follow vertue, or conuersion from sinne: the third is <HI>Tepiditie,</HI> which causeth a man do his worke coldly, without courage or feruor in his busines. This fiend haunteth most commonly among those sort of men, that are too much subiect to their flesh, and being bondslaues to their sensual lusts, haue their reasons obscured, and their desires dulled: they hate Musike, despise Arts, accounting their excellence to be in ignorance; if they speake, it is so abruptly and lothsomly, as it mooueth not; and if they be silent, they rather looke like some blind statues of marble, then liuing and moouing men. If they write, it is <HI>Inuita Minerua,</HI> so coldly and without conceit, as they (like the vntunable ring of Bels) rather fill the ears with iarring and noise, then delight or reason. Many &amp; too many are possessed with this spirit, and this spirit is incarnate in them. For they only like beasts respect present things, hauing no care of that which is to come: you shall sée a slouen sléeping in his bed, that for want of rising loseth the commodity of preferment: another so cold in his enterprises, that he is vnfortunate in all busines. Whatsoeuer commeth from such men, séemeth to be enforced, (so is the eie of their iudgements blinded in percei∣uing that which best behooueth them.) I knew one of this factiō in Oxford, who (after he had studied seuen yeres, &amp; often beaten ouer the Predicables,) at last thanked God y<SUP>•</SUP> he had a litle sight in <HI>Genus:</HI> This was as slouenly a lout as euer I lookt vpon, who often found in his heart to loose his breakfast for want of fetch∣ing: come into his study, you should still sée him sléeping ouer his booke. In all exercises he was alwaies the last: &amp; in all dis∣putations so cold, &amp; duncicall, that neither any man vnderstood him, nor he, himselfe. With this spirit was those two Seruing men seased, the first of which being asked by his master sitting at dinner, what hée had brought from the Sermon? In faith Sir, (said he) your hat and cloake, and nothing els. The second examined in the like manner, answered thus: Faith I markt not the beginning, I was asléepe in the midst, and came a∣way before the end. This is a daungerous fiend wheresoeuer
<PB N="100" REF="54"/>
he gets footing, causing men to make shipwracke of their time, which being short and swift once past is irrecouerable, &amp; which lost (saith <HI>Bias</HI> and <HI>Theophrastus</HI>) a great treasure is lost. This made certaine discontented (as <HI>Timon</HI> and <HI>Apermantus</HI>) waxe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch</NOTE> careles of bodie and soule, fretting themselues at the worlds in∣gratitude, and giuing ouer all diligent indeuor, to serue the fury of their vnbridled minds. The stories registred by learned men are full of men thus affected, and who so considereth the most pollices and Common weals of Christians, shall I fear me (and let me write it with griefe) find more oportunitie lost by cold∣nesse, slacknes, and delay, then consideration can remedy with many yeares heart break and studie. By delay and protraction, enemies wax strong, and lingering hate giueth preuention a di∣ligenter eie; and though <HI>Affricanus</HI> admitteth not officious dili∣gence, yet am I so contrarie to him, that I dare boldly auow, that the most stratagems that are done happily, are done sud∣dainly: yet desire I not to bée misconstrued in this, for be∣fore action, I admit counsel, and secresie: But matters once in∣tended, I hold all time lost till they be executed; for delay giueth the enemie oportunitie of intelligence, weakeneth the heart of the souldior, generally more feruent in the first exploits; and af∣flicteth the heart of the gouernor till the issue be discouered. To conclude, as waters without stirring &amp; mouing, wax corrupt; so without diligence all affaires are either lost or weakened.</P>

with dust for want of looking too, his garments fall in pieces for want of amending, his haire ouergrow his shoulders, for want of barbing, his face couered with durt for want of washing, and he walks generally vntrust, not for exercise sake, but for idlenes: he is still thinking and deuising on things, but he executeth no∣thing, and (like a lunaticke person) runs into strange imagina∣tions, and only speaks them without effecting them: he defers in al that he doth, and thereby loseth the most of his thrift; and in neglecting to sollicite his friends, hée loseth &amp; smothereth his fortunes; so that <HI>Occasion</HI> may rightly say and crie to him out of <HI>Ausonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE></P>

It is a Cinicks life not a Christians, which is ouerpast in negligence, and no∣thing worse becommeth a man, then to be carelesse and impro∣uident: For as fruits vnlookt vnto, are for want of turning soone rotten, so minds for lacke of vertuous meditation, become cor∣rupt and polluted: memorie without vse decai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>th, and the bodie without exercise becommeth lothsome, negligence therefore is fitly compared to a sléepe, for as in it man resteth and is depriued of al that he hath, so in the sléepe of negligence and sinne, al ver∣tues are dispoiled: which is very prettily figured in the sléepe of <HI>Ionas,</HI> of whom it is said, That he fled from the face of our Lord in Tharsis, and entring into a ship fell into a profound sléep, and there arose a great wind, and the tempest increased, and the ship
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>
was in danger; Finally, <HI>Ionas</HI> was cast into the sea, where falling into the belly of a Whale, hée lost his haires of his head, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ud became bald. On which place the glosse saith, That the great and heauie sléepe of the Prophet signifieth a man loa∣den and drowsied in the sléepe of error, for whom, it sufficeth not to flie from our Lord, but furthermore (ouerwhelmed with a certaine carelesnesse) hée is ignorant of Gods wrath and se∣curelie sléepeth, and at last is cast into the Whales bellie, which is the bosome of hell. For as the Whale dwelleth in the déepest flouds, and profoundest seas; so Hell is said to bée in great obscuritie, and in the depth of the earth. Wherevpon in the Gospell it is said, To be in the heart of the earth: For as the heart is in the middest of a creature, so is Hell in the middest of the earth. At the last hée is made bald and spoild of his haire, that is, depriued of his vertues and graces. And where it is said, <HI>Ionas</HI> sléeping the winds arose; it implieth thus much, that a man sléeping in idlenesse, negligence, and carelesnesse, the winds and stormes of temptations suddainlie and vehement∣lie arise: For then are wée most suddainlie surprised with error, when wée are most intangled with improuidence and negligence. And as <HI>Caesar</HI> in his Senate house was assailed when hée least suspected, by his conspirators, so men in their securities are soonest subdued by the assaults of wickednesse; which conspireth the death of the soule. The Poets faine thus of the Syrenes which haunt about Sicily (and of late daies haue appeared in the Sea in India) That with their swéet tunes they draw the Marriners asléepe, that whilest they sléepe soundly, they may sincke their ship. The like may bée said of the Deuill, who lulleth vs in the lap of inconsiderate se∣curitie, and singeth vs asléepe with the notes of <HI>Negligence,</HI> till he sincke the ship of our soule, which is our bodie, in the bottom∣lesse seas of confusion, which is Hell.</P>

<P><HI>Somnolence</HI> and <HI>Sleepinesse</HI> lurketh continually with vn∣fortunate persons, and the excesse thereof sheweth the spirit hath small working: he is a fiend that (wheresoeuer hée in∣habiteth) dulleth the sences, maketh the head heauie, the eies swolne, the bloud hote, corrupt, and excessiue, the face pufft, the members vnlustie, the stomacke irkesome, the féet féeble: Looke in a morning when you sée a fellow stretching himselfe at his window, yawing, and starting, there bée assured this Diuell hath some working: This is a shrowd spirit where∣soeuer hée gets seasure, for hée liueth by the expence of life, and hée that entertaines him, hath rhewms, ca∣thars, defluxions, repletions, and opilations, as ordinari∣lie about him, as euerie substance hath his shadow.

<P>This considered, let this Deuill incarnate (too ordina∣rie a guest in this countrie) bée banished from our societie, least being corrupted by his example, wée fall into the same sinne wherewith hée is intangled: for as <HI>Plato</HI> sayth, <HI><HI>Dormieus est nullius praetis,</HI> A sleepie man is of no worth;</HI> and in the seuenth of his lawes, hée thus writeth, <HI><HI>Somnus mul∣tus, nec animis, nec corporibus▪ nec rebus preclare gerendis, ap∣tus est à natura,</HI> Excessiue sleepe is neither good for the soule or bodie, or auailable in any vertuous or laudable action:</HI> For hée that sléepeth, is no more accounted of then hée that is dead: and truly I am of this opinion, that hée tooke this custome and law from <HI>Homer,</HI> and no other, who sayth, That sléepe is the brother of death: The same allusion also vsed <HI>Diogenes,</HI>

<P>The like consideration likewise had the Doctors of Israel: so that one amongst them (called <HI>Rabi-Dosa</HI> the son of <HI>Harkinas</HI>) writeth, The mornings sléepe, and the euenings dronkennesse, shorten a mans life: corporal sléepe likewise oftentimes ingen∣dreth the sléepe of the soule, which spirituall sléepe is farre more dangerous then the other, and therefore <HI>Cato</HI> dissuadeth youth from it.</P>

This sin (by the Fathers) is compared to the disease (called by the Phi∣sitians) <HI>Paralisis,</HI> with which, whosoeuer is seased, his mem∣bers are dissolued▪ his vitall powers and naturall faculties are weakened, and he himselfe is wholly not himselfe, neither be∣ing able to mooue, nor master his owne lims. So fareth it by a slothfull man, who looseth by this sicknes the light of his mind, the vse of his vnderstanding, y<SUP>•</SUP> good affections that are the props and pillars of the same, and becommeth but the image of that which in effect he is not: and as this infirmity is healed by ve∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> hot Pultesies and inward potions, so except the heat of cha∣rity, and the remembrance of hell fire, be applied to the wounds and dulnes hereof it remaineth wholly incurable. Besides, this sinne is against nature, for as the bird to flie, the fish to swim, the floure to grow, the beast to féed, so man was ordained to la∣bour; which if he do not, he wrongs nature, wrongs his bodie, and which worse is, dams his-soule. <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>li esse piger,</HI> (saith <HI>Augu∣stine</HI>)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serm. 2. de tim. lib. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Be not slow, labour earnestly and God will giue thee eternal life. Helinandus</HI> in his Chronicies reporteth, that when a cer∣taine Bishop (called <HI>Philippus Beluacensis</HI>) was for a night lod∣ged in their Monastery, hée slept so long, that hée was neither present at Gods seruice, neither ashamed to let the sunne (it be∣ing

then Winter time) to behold him sléeping, which when <HI>Helinandus</HI> perceaued, and saw no man readie or bold enough to tell him of his fault, hée confidentlie stept neare vnto his bed, and in briefe spake thus vnto him, Sir the Sparrows haue long since forsaken their nests to salute God, and wil a Bishop y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>t lie sléeping in his chamber? Consider (father) what the Psal∣mist saith, Mine eies haue preuented the day; and that of <HI>Am∣brose,</HI> It is vncomely for a Christian that the beame of the Sunne should behold him idle; and let this persuade you to cast off your slugginesse: The Bishop (rowsed with these wordes all in rage) said vnto him, goe wretch as thou art and louse thy selfe, I disdaine thy counsailes: to whom the Moncke an∣swered in a pleasant manner, Take héed father least your wormes kill you, for mine are alreadie slaine: hée meant the worme of conscience, which shall at last bite them, who are giuen ouer to their sensualities. I haue read also a pret∣tie storie in an old dunce called <HI>Petrus de Lapiaria,</HI> which be∣cause of the pithie allusion I will not sticke to tell you. A cer∣taine King (saith hée) hauing thrée sonnes, and being well kept in yeares, resolued to make his Testament, certify∣ing his children, that which of them was most slothfull, on him hee would bestow his kingdome; to whom the first said, to me belongs the kingdome, for I am so sluggish, that as I sit by the fire I rather suffer my shinnes to bée burnt, then to draw them from the flame: the second hée said, the crowne in all rea∣son belongs to mée, since I am farre more slothfull then thou art, for hauing a rope about my necke, and being rea∣die to bee hanged, and a sword in my hand, suficient to cut the same, yet am I so slothfull, that I will not stretch out my hand to saue my life: after him the third stept vp, and in these wordes m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e his claime, nay saith hée I alone ought to raigne, for I excell you all in flothfulnesse, For lying continually on my backe, water stilleth vpon mine eies, yet I for sloth sake forsake not my bed, neither turne to the right nor to the left hand: and on this sonne the King bestowed his Crowne and kingdome. To yéeld this a Morrall interpre∣tation,
<PB N="107" REF="57"/>
these thrée sonnes are thrée sorts of idle persons; The first that cares not for fire, signifieth him, that being in the companie of euill and luxurious men, will not forsake them: The second, (knowing himselfe hanged in the snaro of the Deuill, as the couetous man) yet hauing and know∣ing the sword of Praier sufficient to cut the rope, neuer∣lesse hée will not vse it: The third (that will neither turne his eie to the right or to the left hand) signifieth him that neither considereth the paines of Hell, nor the rewards of Heauen, So that neither for feare of punishment, nor hope of reward, hée will rise againe from sinne: On him the Deuill his father (who as <HI>Iob</HI> saith, is the King euer the children of pride) bestoweth the kingdome of Hell, where no order but continuall horror inhabiteth. And tru∣lie to the iole and slothfull person Hell doth most iustly ap∣pertaine, because hauing eies to sée his infirmitie hée blindeth them; a mind to vnderstand his remedie, hée disdaineth it; and times made for labour, yet refuseth it: but as <HI>Salomon</HI> saith, <HI><HI>Omnis piger in egestate erit,</HI> The sloth∣full man shall liue in pouertie,</HI> and Hell iustly shall bée his inheritage that negligently forbeareth to labor for heauen. Oh thou slothfull man if this persuade thée not, looke fur∣ther; the male storke senteth the adulteries of the female, except shée wash her selfe, doth not God then both sée and will punish thy sinne except thou mend thy selfe? The Lion smelleth the filthinesse of his adulteresse, and will not hée thinke you looke into the offences of his creatures, yet as∣suredly he that séeth all things beholdeth thy wickednesse, and except thou repent thée, will do iustice on thy negligence.</P>
<P>Hauing alreadie heard the deformities of this mon∣ster, now at the last let vs consider the ren edies against him. First, let vs intentiuely ponder and weigh how much our Sauiour hath laboured and trauailed for the sal∣uation of mankind: It is said that hée past the nights in praier, after whose example if wee desire to bée his, wee must (with the holie Martyrs of the
<PB N="108" REF="58"/>
Primitiue Church) mortifie our earthly members, and follow him in the like exercise: secondly, (in that this sinne of Idlenes hindreth both soule and body, and by that meanes is the occa∣sion of many mischiefes, as well corporall as spiritual.) It hath bene as well detested both in holy scriptures, as in fathers of the Primitiue Church, as appeareth by <HI>Iohannes Clymachus,</HI> where he saith, <HI>Idlenes is a dissolution of the spirit, an abiect feare in all good exercises, an hatred and griefe of any godly profession.</HI> He saith likewise that worldly men are happy, he speaketh til of God, accounting him cruell, and without humanity; he ma∣keth a man astonished in heart, and weake in praier; more hard then iron in the seruice of God, &amp; both slothfull and rebellious to trauell with his hands, or to do obedience. Behold the right effects of deuilish <HI>Astaroth:</HI> consider likewise what fruites spring from this cursed fiend. Thirdly, one of the best meanes to resist the craft of this fiend, is to trauell and to be alwaies doing somewhat, to the end we be not surprized suddenly, as <HI>Saint Ierome</HI> counselleth. To this purpose, the ancient monks of Egypt, had alwaies these words in their mouthes▪ That he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cass lib. 10. cap. 23.</NOTE> which occupieth himselfe in any good exercise, is not tempted by the Deuill; but hée that doth nothing, but liueth Idly, is tormented and possessed with diuers. And if the Heauens, the Sunne, the Moone, and other planets, the birds, beasts, and fishes. are in continuall motion, and without ceasing apply those offices for which they were created; what ought man to do, who is created for trauell, and whose soule is defined by the Philosopher to be a perpetuall motion? Let the Idle go<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>b. de an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>mal.</HI> Prouerb. 6.</NOTE> to schoole to the Ant (as saith <HI>Salomon</HI>) and learne of her to be∣haue him selfe: and let him take héed that hée prooue not that vnfruitfull trée, which must be cast into eternall fire, and that barren figtrée which Christ cursed. Let him alwaies remēber y<SUP>•</SUP> Idlenes is the nurse of all euils, &amp; that it is &amp; hath bin the ouer∣throw of many millions of soules. Let him consider y<SUP>•</SUP> by labour we obtaine reward; by negligence, loose our selues.

wood, where, for the whole day, he occupied the people in cutting downe the wood, and in continuall toile in lopping the trées. But the next day, he caused very sumptuous feasts to be prepared, &amp; commanded his hoast to feast, sport, and make holy day with gladnes; and going to euery company in the midst of their sports, he asked them which of those two daies best liked them: who answered, that the second was more pleasant then the first. To whom he replied in this sort: As by yesterdaies labor you came togither and were assembled to this daies ban∣quet, so can you not be happy and blessed, till first of all you o∣uercome the Medes. So (in alluding to this after a morrall meaning) we can not attaine to blessednesse, except we ouer∣come in this world the Medes, which are the deuils, by vertu∣ous actions; neither can we be admitted to the banket, except by labour in this life time. <HI>Agamemnon, Vlysses,</HI> and <HI>Hercules,</HI> the one besieged and raced Troy; the other, subdued and ouer∣came <HI>Polyphemus;</HI> the third atchieued twelue incredible la∣bours for glories sake: Let not vs therefore refuse labour for heauens sake. The Angels are not idle, but sing praises; the ce∣lestiall bodies (as I say) are not Idle, but obserue their moti∣ons; all airie, earthly, and watry creatures, are in continuall exercise: aire is continually tossed by the wind; water continu∣ally ebbes and flowes. If therefore all creatures detest <HI>Sloth,</HI> and imbrace Labour, to giue man example; let vs forsake loth∣some Idlenesse, for many foretold and these set down by <HI>Ouid:</HI></P>

Let vs follow <HI>Paul,</HI> who wrought with his hands, least he should be troublesome to his brethren. Let exercise neuer forsake vs, ei∣ther of mind or of body: for the Deuill (as <HI>Ierome</HI> saith) is like a thiefe, who finding a horse idle in the fields, gets vpon the backe of him, where contrary of those that labour, he can catch no holdfast. <HI>Idlenesse</HI> (saith <HI>Bernard) <HI>Est mater nugarum, nouerca virtutum,</HI> Is the mother of toies, and the stepdame of vertue:</HI> for it casteth the strong man headlong into offence, and choking vertue, nourisheth pride, and squareth out the path to hell. If the castle be vnwalled, the Enemie enters; if the earth be vn∣manured, it bringeth forth thornes; if the vine be neglected, it groweth fruitlesse: So if our bodies and mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> be vnexercised, they are the sooner seduced and distracted.</P>
