<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Entle and Curteous Reader; hauing for many yeares past spent my time both in rea∣ding, practising, and confer∣ring with others in, and a∣bout the studie of the Ma∣thematicall Sciences, and through great paines and trauell, at the request of diuers Worshipfull Gentlemen. Merchants, and others of my very louing friends, haue at last collected and gathered together many excellent Rules and easie Abreuiations in the Science of Arithmatick, which at the entreaty, and by the meanes of the helpe of some of them, I haue at last made bold heere to present abroad vnto the worlds view, the first fruites of some idle houres studie, the most part whereof I doe acknowledge to haue gotten by the practice and vse of the most excellent Instrument, inuented by Master <HI>William Pratt,</HI> called, The Iewell of
<PB REF="4"/>
Arithmatick in which I haue done the best of my Indeauours, not to hide that Tallent in the earth, which God hath bestowed vp∣on me for the benefit of others, but rather to his great glory and prayse, and for the benefit of my Country, and for the furthe∣ring of all that are studious in the Art of Numbers, I haue laboured to set it forth in the most briefe, plaine, and easie manner that I could fit for the vnderstanding of the weakest and meanest capacitie. In which if any thing shall seeme obscure or doubtful to any man, I could wish my selfe were pre∣sent to resolue his doubts, for I haue indea∣uoured to make the Rules as briefe, short and easie, as I could deuise.</P>
<P>In my first Book I haue intreated concer∣ning vulgar Arithmatick, with new inuen∣tions of my owne, in all the first foure parts of Arithmatick, <HI>viz</HI> in <HI>Addition</HI> and <HI>Subtracti∣on,</HI> with two seuerall kinds of <HI>Multiplication,</HI> not charging of the memory, neuer extant before in any Author that I haue read, with foure seuerall kinds of <HI>Diuision,</HI> the latter of them bringing the proofe by <HI>Addition</HI> of the figures vnder the diuidend, without any multiplication, or casting away of nines, according to the accustomed manner.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>Againe, in the worke of Fractions, I haue set them forth in plaine and perfit figures after another manner of my owne inuenti∣on, because the fractionall figures in most bookes of Arithmatick were so vnperfit, that they were scarce to be descerned, and in this manner they will performe all facti∣onall operations, as well as if they were set out according to the vsuall manner. In the end of which Rules I haue shewed the rea∣sons and proofes of fractions by the known parts of Coyne.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in the second part of the former booke, I haue set forth Reduction, both in Coyne sterling `waights, measures, time and motion; the Tables whereof are in the first part of the book, with diuers Rules how to bring pence, or farthings at the first worke into pounds, shillings and pence; with di∣uers questions wrought by Reduction, with Progression Arithmaticall and Geo∣metricall, with examples.</P>
<P>And lastly, I haue shewed how to worke the Rule of 3 Direct and Conuerst, both in whole numbers and fractions, after diuers seuerall manners of workings, and how to find the diuisor in any question, as also di∣uers wayes to worke Fellowship, Barter,
<PB REF="5"/>
Exchange, Allegation, Interest, Position, and all other operations Arithmeticall, with ex∣amples and briefe Rules of euery part.</P>
<P>In my second booke of Decimall Arith∣matick, I haue first described out the parts and vse of the decimall Table, and how to set forth any number giuen in Decimalls.</P>
<P>Secondly, I haue shewed how to worke all the seuerall parts of Arithmatick, <HI>viz. Numeration, Addition, Subtraction▪ Multiplicati∣on</HI> and <HI>Diuision</HI> in Decimalls; with examples and proofes of euery worke in the knowne parts of Coyne.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I haue handled in as briefe man∣ner as I could, the Rule of 3 Fellowship, Barter, Exchange and Interest in Decimall Arithmatick, as before in vulgar, in which you may perceiue the great labour that is auoided, in vulgar Arithmatick, with diuers examples and proofes of the same.</P>
<P>Lastly, I haue added a small Treatice of <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Annuities;</HI> with the manner how to calculate Tables or Breuiats at any rate, or yeares purchase giuen; all which I haue drawne into a pocket vollume. If therefore any Gentleman, Merchant, or other, be desi∣rous to haue further instruction, if they re∣paire to my lodging in <HI>Coleman-street,</HI> I shall
<PB REF="6"/>
be ready to giue them any satisfaction.</P>
<P>If therefore I shall find these my labours and indeauors to take that effect, which I do hope and wish for, I shall be thereby the sooner incouraged to hasten the comming forth of the third part of this volume con∣cerning the extraction of Rootes, with ma∣ny easie operations and rules showing the vse of the Square and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubicque rootes, con∣cerning Mensurations of land Timber, Board, Glasse and Stone, and the reduction of Measures from one proportion to another by their squares giuen: and lastly, concer∣ning Millitary affaires and Gunners Art; concerning the Arithmeticall worke, with demonstration by examples, which I had in∣tended to haue ioyned to this vollume, but that it would haue increased it far beyond a pocket book. And so hoping of your friend∣ly censure &amp; acceptance of these first fruits of my labours, I cease, hoping to haue my true indeauors and meaning well taken, and the faults in the Printing friendly amended, desiring a blessing from God vpon these my poore labours, I take my leaue,</P>

<P>If a number be giuen, whose value is to be expressed, you shall vnderstand, that the figure next the right hand is the least in va∣lew, and signifieth simply his owne valew, as the figure of 1 doth signifie but one, and the figure of 2 doth signifie but two, and the figure of 8 signifies but eight, and so of any other. And in the second place towards the left hand, euery figure is in valew tenne, so that the figure of one there doth signifie tenne, the figure of 2 twenty, the figure of 8 eightie, and so of all other: in the third place towards the left hand, euery figure is in valew one hundred, so that the figure 1 in that place signifies one hundred, the 2, two hundred, &amp;c. In the fourth place, euery fi∣gure is in valew one thousand, so there the figure of one signifies one thousand, the fi∣gure 2, two thousand, &amp;c. In the fifth place, euery figure is in value ten thousand: in the sixth place, one hundred thousand; and in the seuenth place, one thousand thousands, or one million: in the eight place, ten mil∣lions: in the ninth place, one hundred mil∣lions:
<PB REF="11"/>
in the tenth place, one thousand mil∣lions, or one milliot; and so infinitely names may be giuen to the valew of euery pricke, as is vsuall in the second part of Arithme∣tick, of Number, Square, Cube, sursolid, &amp;c. or in Astronomicall Arithmetick, Primes, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths and Fifths, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now to expresse the valew of any num∣ber giuen, set a prick with the pen ouer the fourth figure towards the left hand, and o∣uer the seuenth, and tenth; and so ouer eue∣ry third figure towards the left hand, to the end of your figures, as in this Exam∣ple:</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Now begin and expresse the first foure figures towards the right hand, as if they stood alone, which are 2567, or two thou∣sand fiue hundred sixty seuen. Then reade the figures belonging to the second prick, which are 430, as if they stood alone thus, foure millions three hundred two thousand fiue hundred sixty seuen: then take the three figures belonging to the third prick, which
<PB REF="12"/>
are 635, or sixe millions three hundred fif∣tie foure millions three hundred and two thousand fiue hundred sixtie seuen: and so this whole summe is thus to bee read, two hundred thirty seuen thousand eight hun∣dred fifty sixe milliots three hundred fiftie foure millions three hundred and two thou∣sand fiue hundred and sixty seuen; and so of any other summe.</P>

<P>ADdition is the second part of Arith∣matick, and serueth to adde or collect diuers summes of seuerall denominations, and to expresse their totall value in one summe.</P>
<P>In Addition begin to adde your sums at the right hand with the smallest numbers or denominations first, and gathering of their totall mark how many of the smaller makes one of the next greater; as if your addition be Farthings, for euery foure farthings car∣ry one peny in mind to be added to the num∣bers

<P>In the first example toward the left hand I begin with farthings, which are 3, which I set downe: then next 9 pence and 11 is 20, and 2 is 22, and 1 makes 23, and 2 makes 25, and 3 makes 28, and 11 makes 39 pence, or 3 shillings 3 pence; I set downe the 3 pence, and carry in mind the 3 shillings to be added to the place of shillings. Then adde the seuerall summes of shillings, which are 1. 1. 2 7. 8, the totall is 19, and the 3 in mind makes 22 shillings; set downe the 2 shillings, and keepe two tennes to be added to the tennes of shillings, which are 3 tens,
<PB REF="13"/>
which makes 5 tennes, or 50 shillings; set downe the odde tenne to the 2 shillings, which makes 12 shillings, &amp; carry 2 pound for the forty shillings to the next place of pounds, which are 5. 9. 6. 4. 7. 2. 4, and the 2 in mind makes 39; leaue the 9 vnder the place of vnites, and carry 3 tennes in mind, and 7. 5. 5. 5. 8. 2. 2, totall is 37; set downe the 7 vnder the place of tennes, and carry 3 in mind for the 30 tennes, which is 3 hun∣dred: then 3 in mind, and 2. 8. 8. 3. 1. 2. 3, totall is 30; set a cypher, or 0 in the place of hundreds, and carry 3 for the 30 into the place of thousands: then last of all, 3 in mind, and 3. 7. 1 makes 14 thousand, and be∣cause it is the last summe, you must set them all downe, placing the 4 vnder the place of thousands, and the 1 one place more towards the left hand, and then the Totall summe of those particulars will be 14079 pound, 12 shillings, 3 pence, 3 farthings, as appeareth in the example; and in the like manner is the other example to bee cast vp into one Totall: and so I will here end with Additi∣on of Coine, &amp; put a seueral example of eue∣ry table for the full tables &amp; perfect vnder∣standing of the said table, which are of great vse in all the seuerall rules of Arithmetick.</P>

first, I begin with the drams in the first ex∣ample to the right hand, which are 3. 1. 3, to∣tall is 7 drames, which I note downe vnder∣neath, because they are lesse then one ounce.

<P>Thirdly, the pounds are 2. 10. 1. 12. 10. 17 totall is 52 pound, which is one quarter of a hundred, and 24 pound, place 24 pound vnder the place of pounds, and put one quarter, as before in the place of quarters of hundreds.</P>
<P>Fourthly, 1. 3. 1. 2. 3 quarters, are 10 quarters, or 2 hundred and 2 quarters, or halfe a hundred; place 2 quarters in the place of quarters, and put ouer 2 into the place of hundreds for the 8 quarters.</P>
<P>Then 2. 7. 2. 7. 3. 8. 7 makes 36 hundred, place 6, and carry 3 for the 30: then say, 3. 1. 2. 1. 3. 1. 2, totall is 13; place 3 there, and carry one for the 10, which one in mind, and 1. 1 makes 3, which set downe, and the total is 336 hundred, 2 quarters, 24 pound, 0 ounces, 7 drammes; and so the other ex∣ample

<P>In the first example of Coyne, begin your subtraction at the right hand, saying; 1 farthing from 3 farthings, leaues 2 far∣things, which note downe vnder the 1 far∣thing. Then 10 pence from 11 pence, leaues 1 penny. Thirdly, 19 shillings from 17 shil∣lings you cannot haue, therefore take one pound, or 20 shillings, and adde to 19 shil∣lings, saying, 19 shillings from 37 shillings, rests 18 shillings, which note downe. Then 1 that you borrowed, &amp; 3 pound, is 4 pound from 6 pound, leaues 2 pound to set downe vnder 3. Then 8 from 8 leaues nothing, place there a Cypher, or 0 vnder 8. Then 5 from 7 rests 2; then 2 from 9 leaues 7,
<PB REF="22"/>
which also note againe; 9 from 8 cannot be taken, then make it 10 more, and say 9 from 18 leaues 9, which set downe: and last of all, 1 borrowed and 6 is 7, from 7 leaues no∣thing, and the worke is ended, and the re∣mayner will bee 97202 pound 18 shillings 1 penny 2 farthings, as appeareth in the ex∣ample before going.</P>

<P>THis Table of Multiplication must bee learned perfectly by heart, for to know readily what the multiplication of any two digit numbers vnder nine, or vnto nine doe make, and then Multiplication will be very easie: for Multiplication is a number of ad∣ditions speedily performed; as if you should

say, How many in number is 8 times 7, if you should set downe 7 eight times one vn∣der another, and adde them together, the to∣tall will be 56: but if you looke in the Ta∣ble for 8 in the head, and 7 in the side, you shall finde vnder 8, right against 7 in the the same paralell 56; or if you find 8 in the side, and 7 in the head, the like number will appeare, and these numbers in the table are to be fit in memory.</P>

<P>First, begin your multiplication at the right hand, saying, 7 times 8 make 56, place 6 vnder the 7, and keepe 5 in mind, to bee added to the product of the multiplication of 7 by 6, saying, 7 by 6 makes 42, and 5 in mind is 47; set 7 downe vnder the 6, and keepe 4 in mind: then 7 by 9 is 63, and 4 makes 67; set 7 downe, and keepe 6 in mind: then 7 by 7 is 49, and 6 is 55; place 5 and keepe 5 in mind: lastly, 7 by 8 is 56, and 5 is 61, which set downe the 1 first, and the

<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Secondly, begin with 8, the second figure of your multiplier, saying, 8 times 8 is 64; place the 4 vnder the said 8, and keepe the 6 in mind: then 8 by 6 is 48, and 6 makes 54; set downe 4 in the next place, and keepe 5 in mind: then 8 by 9 is 72, and 5 makes 77; set downe 7, and keepe 7 in mind: then 8 by 7 is 56, and 7 makes 63; set downe 3, and keepe 6. Lastly, 8 by 8 is 64, and 6 makes 70; set the 0 first, and the 7 one place more towards the left hand, and cancell the 8 of your multiplier, and the worke will stand thus.</P>

Thirdly, begin with 9, the last figure of your multiplyer, saying, 9 by 8 is 72; place the 2 vnder the said 9, and keepe 7: then 9 by 6 is 54, and 7 is 61; place 1, and keepe 6: then 9 by 9 is 81, and 6 is 87; place 7, and keep 8: then 9 by 7 is 63, and 8 is 71▪ place 1, and keepe 7: last of all, 9 by 8 is 72, and 7 is 79; place the 9 first, and the 7 one place more towards the right hand, and the whole worke is ended, then gather the totall by ad∣dition.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Diuision.</HEAD>
<P>SEt your Diuidend, which is the number to be diuided in the vpper part, and the Diuisor next to the left hand, vnder the greatest figures in value of your Diuidend: If the vpper numbers bee greater then the lower, or else place your diuisor one place more towards your right hand, as in this example.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>If you would diuide 78567 by 84, place them as aboue; for because you cannot haue 8 out of 7 in the Diuidend, therefore place your 8 one place more towards the right hand, and the 4 next to it, and your quoti∣ent you must place at the right side of your numbers behind a crooked line. But I will first giue an example of Diuision by one fi∣gure: I would diuide 65490 pound amongst 5 men; place your numbers thus.</P>
<P><PB REF="33"/>
<HI>Example.</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>First, I seeke how oft 5 is in 6, this I may haue but once; then put 1 in the quotient beyond the crooked line, and take 5 out of 6, and there will rest 1, set that ouer 6, and then remoue your diuisor one place more to the right hand, and then seeke you how ma∣ny times 5 may be had in 15, and the answer is, thrice, therefore place; in the quotient, and by it multiply your diuisor 5, makes 15, which taken out of 15, leaues nothing, place a 0 ouer the 5, and remoue your diuisor, and seeke how ost you may haue 5 in the 4 ouer it, but you cannot haue it once; where∣fore put a 0 in the quotient, and remoue your diuisor, and seeke how many times you may haue 5 in the figures ouer and behind it, which are 49, and you may haue it nine times, put 9 in the quotient, and by it mul∣tiply your diuisor 5, makes 45, which taken from 49, leaues 4, which place aboue the 9. And lastly, remoue againe your Diuisor 5
<PB REF="33"/>
vnder the 0, and seeke how many times 5 is in 40, and you shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd it 8 times, place 8 in the quotient, and by it multiply 5, makes 40 which taken from 40, leaues nothing remai∣ning and the worke is ended, and will stand thus, as in the example, and I find, if I di∣uide 65490 pound amongst 5 men, euerie man shall haue for his part 13098 pound.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>And this is the order of Diuision for one figure: but if your Diuisor doe consist of more figures then one, then you must take the first figure of your Diuisor no oftner out of the Diuidend, then you can also take eue∣ry seuerall figure of your Diuisor, out of the same figures of the Diuidend standing a∣boue them, as for example.</P>
<P>If you would diuide 86824416 by 987, which was one of the products of the multi∣plications in the rules before going, for a triall of your former worke, then place your numbers, as in the example following.</P>
<P><PB REF="34"/>
<HI>Example.</HI>
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Then I seeke how oft I may haue 9 in 86, I find I may haue it 9 times; but if I consider the next figure 8 of my Diuisor, I cannot haue also 9 times 8 out of the numbers re∣maining; if I take 9 times 9, which is 81, out of 86, there will remaine but 5; and then 9 times 8, the next figure of my diuisor, makes 72, which cannot be taken out of 58 which will remaine; therefore I place 8 in the quotient, and by that I multiply all the figures of my Diuisor, 987 makes 7896, which taken from 8682, leaues 786 aboue them: and the worke will stand thus.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P><PB REF="34"/>Secondly, I remoue my Diuisor 987 one place nearer the right hand, and then I seeke how oft I may haue 9 in 78, which I see I can haue but 7 times, so I put 7 in the Quo∣tient, and by that 7, I multiply my Diuisor 987, makes 6909, which taken from 7864, the numbers aboue them there will remaine 955, and the worke will stand thus.</P>

<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Thirdly, againe I remoue my diuisor 987 one place nearer the right hand, and seeke how many times I may haue 9 in 95, and I find I may haue it 9 times, which 9 I set in∣to the Quotient, and by it multiply 987, makes 8883, which taken from 9554 leaues 671, and the worke will stand thus.</P>

<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></P>
<P>Fourthly, I remoue my Diuisor againe, and seeke how oft I may haue 9 in 67, and I see I can haue it but 6 times, then I put 6 in the quotient, and by it multiplie 987, makes 5922, which taken from 6711, leaues 789, and the worke will stand in the example fol∣lowing.</P>

<P>Lastly, I remoue my Diuisor againe, and seeke how oft I may haue 9 in 78, and I find I may haue it 8 times, which 8 I put into the quotient, and by it I multiply my Diuisor 987 makes 7896, equal vnto the numbers a∣boue; and so being taken away, leaues no∣thing remaining, and proues the multipli∣cation to be truly wrought, as appeareth in the example following.</P>

<P>ALlegation is an Artē teaching to com∣bine or knit together diuers things vn∣equally prised, and thereby to find an equall price of any part of the said mixture, Alli∣gation Mediall, is that which by the aug∣menting the quantitie of euery seueral por∣tion to be mixed by his owne price, and di∣uiding the summe of all the products by the totall of the seuerall portions to bee mixed, findeth the thing sought.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Three seueral sorts of Barly are to be mix∣ed; <HI>viz.</HI> 34 bushels at 18 pence, and 76 at 20 pence, and 100 at 22 pence; the Questi∣on is, what one bushell of that mixture will be worth? First, multiply each number by his price, <HI>viz.</HI> 34 by 18, 76 by 20, and 100 by 22, makes 612, 1520, and 1200, the to∣tall is 4332: then adde the number of bush∣ells into one summe, makes 210; by which diuide 4332 <HI>d.</HI> makes 20 pence, 132∶210 of one penny for the price of one bushell so mixed.</P>

<P>If you will mixe 30 gallons of Sacke at 4 shillings a gallon, with 150 gallons of White Wine at 2 shillings the gallon, what will a gallon of that mixture bee worth?

Set your number of one hun∣dred found in the Table, to a vnite in deci∣malls, as in the last example 164 stands thus 1|64 seconds, then you neede but diuide
<PB N="342" REF="227"/>
your number 356 by 1 pound, 64 seconds, and the quotient is 217 ells, 12 164 ells, as in the last example.</P>
<P>Againe, if you would reduce London measure to the measures of any other place? Find the number of 100 to that place, and set it decimalls, and multiply your number of ells at London by those numbers found, and the product will be your desire.</P>
<P><HI>2. Example.</HI></P>
<P>In 758 ells at London, how many ells at Dantzing, I find in the Table 139 ells there make 100 at London; so I set 139 to a vnite, and it is 1 pound, 39 seconds; by which I multiply 758, makes 1053 ells, 62∶100 parts.</P>
