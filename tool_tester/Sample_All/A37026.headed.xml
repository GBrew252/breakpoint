<P>Now listen then. There was a Gentleman, one <HI>Beauford,</HI> bred up here at our University, who, about two years since, unfortu∣nately killing a Gentleman in a Duel, was forc'd to fly—but, ere he went, there was a Match propounded by his Father (and for some time secretly carried on by him) betwixt his Son, and my now Wife, the sole Daughter and Heir of the old Lord <HI>Thorough-good</HI>; she never saw <HI>Beauford</HI> but once, and then this misfortune happening, the business was deferred — till he got his Pardon; but, before he could procure it, the old man his Father dy'd, leaving his Estate in Trustees hands, till <HI>Beauford</HI> should come to age. Now, in this juncture, I neerly resembling him in stature, and complexion, and being then pas∣sionately in Love with <HI>Olivia,</HI> boldly pursu'd the Plot, and, about six Months since, changing my Name for his, as if I came just then from <HI>Paris,</HI> made my Address; 'Twas doubtful at first, by reason we differ a little in Face; but, telling her I had lately been sick of the Small Pox, which had extremely alter'd me, it pass'd clearly, and in a Weeks time I Married her, then discover'd all, and ask'd her pardon, which she never wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d grant, and that's the reason of all our Quar∣rels and Jealousi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s—</P>

<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Mistriss, but not beating Rascal, nor had the last pre∣vail'd so, had I not been orepower'd; but the Devil's in't, my damn'd fortune still jades me, for when I have brought a Plot just to perfection, by some awkard negligent action or other, I am sure to spoil all agen, and then if no skirmish happen, 'tis ten to one but I am disgrac'd, and that's all one: as for example, When I was in Town last, dining at a Judges House, whilst he was in his study setling some Law-business, I took the boldness to make Love to his Wife.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! alas poor silly creature, if thou didst but know what an insufficient—what a sign of a Husband thou wert so ea∣ger of, thou wouldst think the purchase dear at the rate of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gilt shilling. Sure never was creature so fond, she haun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s me where ever I goe, smiles when I smil'd, and is sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncholly when I am so, and then is eternally vowing perpetual Love and Constancy. Nay, and what feeds my revenge high, and pleases me most of all, is, she is now going to deliver me up all her Jewels—those very Jewels which my Husband has given her, as the price of his impure Love; and this is so full satisfaction, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my wishes are all bounded — here comes <HI>Beauford</HI> too, whom I must confes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d but s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urvi∣ly, in so long delaying the reward due to his passion, but 'tis his mis∣fortune, for the only satisfaction he desires, is the only thing I dare not grant him.

<P>And when Love Madam—like hoarded mettle, lies rust∣ing, and is almost spoil'd for want of use, where lies the pleasure or profit?</P>

<P>Bring but your recompence within the list of Honor▪ Reason, and Virtue, and there's my hand, I'll be more free than your wishes in the performance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah dear Rogue— on this white Altar I could eternally pay my hearts oblations — but a word more of Virtue and Reason, and I swound, my Teeth chatter already; 'gad 'tis like swallowing an Issicle just after a man has drunk a comfortable Elixir to warm him. But Madam, in strict sense, what greater reason is there, than in charitably saving a poor young hopeful fellow from the grave; or what's more like a Woman of Honor, than to be punctual in keep∣ing her word?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cucko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lding ones Husband is a glorious point of Honor, I must needs say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauf.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is, and necessary too, as your case stands; let me tell you that Madam, virtue has nothing to do here, you are to follow the dictates of Love and Revenge, without the consideration of what is right or wrong.—As in a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el no man of Honor or Courage invited to be Second, stays to debate whose Cause is best, but boldly pushes on at all adventures—and makes his friends Life and Honor equal with his own; he that coldly stands in niceties or punctillo's, is a Craven and no Cock of the Game, I'll answer for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, since 'tis decreed, and that I am to pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o dear∣ly for your service, I'm resolv'd to have my penny worth out of ye, therefore listen to my Commands, which obey'd and perform'd, perhaps I may come to terms.</P>
