<HEAD>¶ <HI>To the right worshipfull and his singu∣ler</HI> good friends, M. Thomas Darcie and M. Brian Dat∣cie Esquiers. <HI>William Lowth</HI> wisheth happie health, ioyfull <HI>prosperitie with the increase of all Godly knowledge</HI> in Christ Iesus our Lorde.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN I had diligently weighed and duely considered with my selfe. (Right Woorshipfull) the manifolde curtesies, and sure to∣kens of vnfeigned friendshippe, which diuers and sundry times I haue heretofore receiued at your worships hands, sithence my first cōming into this countrie of Es∣sex: I was inwardly moued, stirred, and procured there∣by, to deuise, studie and finde out some way, whereby I might some what exonerate and discharge my selfe of the heauie loade of your vndeserued friendlinesse towards me and mine. So that after I had well deliberated of this mat∣ter, ransaked all my weake and sillie senses, and throughly recounted with my selfe, mine owne estate, wealth and condition, I found it altogether more simple, ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and slen∣der, then that it mighte in any respecte counteruayle your kindenesse. Notwithstanding at the last by good happe, lighting on a Booke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ <HI>De Oeconomia Christi∣ana,</HI> A matter cōtaining a Christianlike ordering &amp; gouer∣ning
<PB REF="3"/>
of an houshoulde and familie: collected, framed and composed in the Latine tongue (after the order of a Dia∣logue) by the first Author Bartholomew Batty of <HI>Alostensis</HI> for the vtilitie and profite of his brethren, children, and countrie men, whereof. I taking some good liking at the first viewe, setled my selfe therein, and would not giue it ouer, vntill suche time as I had throughly perused and diligently read ouer the same. And the matter being pitthy, pleasaunt and profitable, bewrapt me in such delight, that I could not choose, but bestow the second reading therof, &amp; so waded through againe with a more deep consideration, care and diligence then before. Thus passing through the second time I gleyned and gathered together certaine speci∣all notes for mine owne better instruction and reformati∣on of mine owne family. Of the whiche when some of my deare friendes had taken the viewe, together with the Booke, and also hauing good liking thereof, they beganne to perswade me earnestly, and that with ma∣ny and great reasons, that it would be very profitable not only vnto my selfe, for mine owne priuate exercise and in∣crease of knowledge (but also vnto all Parents &amp; childrē, Maisters and seruants old and young, of what estate, degree &amp; condition soeuer, being ignorant of the Latine tongue) if I would bestow, not only the translating therof. But al∣so afterwards commit the same to the printing, that therby our countrie and countriemen (which are right deare vnto vs) might also reape some profite and commodity. And al∣beit I thought my selfe farre vnfit for that purpose and not sufficiētly able to performe their honest &amp; earnest requests nor to manifest the Authours iust deserued praise, in fra∣ming so fit a paterne for this our age &amp; time. Yet at the last aswel for their importunacy, as also chiefly for the increase of mine owne knowledge, and to doe my countriemen
<PB REF="3"/>
some pleasure (after the example of others.) I haue presu∣med very boldly to attēpt this matter. And as time would permit me frōmine other daily exercises, haue brought the same to such effect as may now appeare, without any iniu∣ry vnto the first Authour. I haue now disfurnished &amp; chan∣ged him out of his owne rich robes and gallant garments, and haue apparelled him after the English fashion, which though perhaps to some may seeme euill shapen, at the first sight, and will also deeme, that the stuffe is not so fine, excel∣lent and costly, nor set out with such delicate deuises, picked points, and curious colours, as the worthinesse of the thing doth deserue, nor that I haue shewed my selfe ther in a cun∣ning and skilful Artificer: yet is it good, wholsome and du∣rable, and not of the coursest nor vilest kind of stuffe, ney∣ther of the basest and simplest fashion. So that such as shall behold the sound body and inward substance, rather thē the outward shew, and shall endure the same vnto the end: shal find (no doubt) sufficient matter ministred vnto them: to garde and defend them at all assayes from many mishaps, sharpe showers, terrible tempests, iniuries and inconuenien∣ces, which otherwise for want therof, might more sodain∣ly annoy them. And for that your worships are Fathers of many children (which I am perswaded are dearly beloued vnto you) and maisters of great families, wherof I knowe you haue care to be vertuously instructed, guided, gouerned and trayned vp in the feare of God. And because this whole discourse tendeth to the same purpose and effect, I haue thought it good to offer these my simple paynes and trauels vnto your woorships, as the present of a true and faithfull friend, which faine would haue offered you a better gift, if his power would haue extended thereunto. But herein fol∣lowing the examples of poore men in the auncient hysto∣ries, I am so much the bolder, euen for the very goodwill
<PB REF="4"/>
I beare to you and yours. Humbly beseeching your woor∣ships to shrowd the same vnder the shadow of your wings. So shall I thinke my selfe safe, let the bawling Barkers, cu∣rious Cauillors, sawsie Sycophants and Momus his mates, with all the rable of Ruffians in their fretting fumes say what they can. Which if you wil vouchsafe to doe, I haue my whole desire, and will continually pray vnto Almigh∣tie God, to send you in this earthly habitatiō happie health, ioyfull prosperitie, with the increase of much woor∣shippe. And after this life euerlasting bles∣sednesse in the heauenly Hierusalem.</P>

And herewithal calling to mind that worthy &amp; notable saying of the Diuine Philosopher <HI>Plato,</HI> cyted by <HI>Cicero</HI> in his first booke of Offices. <HI>Non nobis solum nati sumus: ortus e∣nim nostri, partem patria vendicat, partem parentes, partem amici.</HI> I was heereby incited, stirred, and procured, to make this more fa∣miliar and openly knowne vnto thee, beeyng a matter so profita∣ble and necessary for all parents, maisters, children, and seruants, Wherein as in a most cleere glasse they may plainly see, what doth appertayne to their seuerall dueties.</P>
<P>And albeit I haue vsed a playne and simple stile in this my trās∣lation: yet well beseeming the matter (I trust) though perhaps not to eche mans lyking.

<P>And I (my good louing father) doe wish asmuch vnto you with all my heart. But heare I pray you, from whence come you so early? It is scarcely day as yet, hath any thing chaunced contra∣ry to your minde? Is your wife and children well, and in good health?</P>

<SPEAKER>Amusus.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife, with my whole familie are in very good health (thankes bee vnto God) if you weigh and consider only their bodies. But if you in∣wardly beholde their soules (which is the most excellent part of man) then shall you finde nothing to bee more lamented, nothing more miserable, nothing (to bee short) more out of order, the Lorde God amend it when his will is.</P>

<P>Alas, why so? Let mée know it I pray you, kéepe it not secrete, bée not afraide, beléeue mée I say, I will helpe you either with my counsel, or otherwise with any thing that I may, to the vttermost of my power.</P>

<P>When I doe beholde the families in these our borders and partes<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Amusus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦leth the state of disordered fa∣milies.</NOTE> euery where, I am exceedingly mooued with sorrowe: for I see the youth growe vp in euery place without any instruction of godlinesse, vertue or good manners, as if they were the children of the most barbarous nati∣ons, nay rather of the very Turkes and Infidels, so little regarde is there
<PB REF="6"/>
of true godlinesse and vertue for the most part. And againe when I am cō∣pelled to come to mine owne familie and to consider the same so farre out of order (I had welnigh said vtterly corrupted and past al hope) I am altogether wearie of my life: For by the disposition of mine owne children I easily gather, that the youth in this our age is not onely void of al good discipline, but also growne to such libertie and boldnesse, that al∣most they wil receiue no admonition, be it neuer so godlie. This plague when I note in mine owne: I am moued vnto anger, I chide, I threaten, yea and sometime I strike them, but with al these thinges it auaileth little or nothing. Wherfore very earnestly and not without teares I haue often de∣sired of Almighty God, that in this my greate heauinesse and sorrowe hee woulde vouchsafe to send me some wholsome and godlie Counsel, so that after many praiers, &amp; supplicatiōs made, I haue foūd nothing to be more profitable for me, then to cōmit the same to some godly and learned man, which after I had deepely weighed &amp; considered in my mind, you are the first with whom I met, therfore al shame laide aparte, I come vnto you, as it were mine only aide and sanctuarie, &amp; this hath bin often in my mind heretofore, but I haue byn afraide to trouble you, yet now at the last, ne∣cessitie that cruel weapon, hath euen compelled mee to shake of al shame and feare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am angry with this your continual &amp; vnprofitable shamefast∣nesse: haue not I euer borne you goodwill, euen as to my brother? And therefore, why shoulde you not bée bolde to come vnto mée af∣ter a familier manner? I haue often promised vnto you my studie and trauell without any exception, &amp; am still mynded to performe the same: what is the cause therfore that you haue not come to my house? so that if you had come, think not that you should haue trou∣bled me, but rather that nothing could haue chaunced more accep∣table, and ioyfull vnto me then your presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amusus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reuerend Sir, I most humbly thanke you for this your greate curtesie and goodwil towards me, and I heartily pray you, that according to your accustomed wisedome and godlinesse you would teach me, and as it were with your finger, point me out the methode &amp; order of godly &amp; vertuous education &amp; instructing of children, for albeit I am vnlearned, &amp; a poore house keeper, yet (God is my witnesse) how earnestly I doe desire &amp; wish with al my heart, to see my poore and wretched children godly and ver∣tuously
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
trained vp and instructed in the true knowledge, faith, religion, &amp; feare of almighty God. And further, that they might be taught in al ciui∣litie and good manners, and so learne to walke in the waies of our Lorde God, that at the last after this wretched miserable and short life, they may be made heires of that most excellent and euerlasting ioy with the electe and Saintes of God in heauen: for what other thing is this life, then dust, a shadow, and the very image of death? The prophet Dauid saith, thou hast<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 39.</NOTE> made my daies as it were a spanne long, and mine age is euen as nothing in respect of thee: And verily euery man liuing is altogether vanitie. For man walketh in a vaine shadow, and disquieteh himselfe in vaine: Hee heapeth vp riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Verely, neither by chaunce, nor fortune▪ haue you come hither, but by the determinate wil and appointment of God. Forasmuch as I haue earnestly desired to haue some cōference about this mat∣ter with a man thus hungring and thirsting after righteousnesse, the woorde of God, and chiefly in this kinde of studie, or exercise, wherein is handled the dutie of housholders, Parentes and Chil∣dren, then the which in this our time I iudge nothing more accep∣table to God, nothing more profitable or necessarie to mankinde: For as there is nothing more to bée lamented, then that father of housholde which neglecteth his familie in their good reformation: so is there none more honest or godly, then hée which beginneth to informe his youth euen from their young and tender yéeres, and doeth prouide to haue them diligently instructed in all good &amp; godly literature: And agayn as there is nothing more vnséemely or to bée lamented in a familie or housholde, then to sée the youth suffered to growe vp &amp; passe foorth their time, without shewing vnto their Parentes or Maisters, any honour, reuerence, or obedience: so is there nothing more pleasing vnto God, &amp; more ioyful to Parents and Maisters, then diligently to sée their families exercised in the feare and loue of God, and to shew due honour vnto their Parents or maisters, with al obedience and reuerence in the Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amusus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is God onlie, and that by his prouidence wherwith he gouerneth al¦thinges, that guided and brought me vnto you, to the ende that I of you beeing wel, and Godlie instructed might returne vnto my familie,
<PB REF="7"/>
and that so heereafter I may bee able to exhort and instruct my children, and seruants, that they aswell by mine examples, as exhortations and counsels, may learne to serue God, and walke in his waies all the dayes of their liues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I had diligently read ouer Saint Paule <HI>1. Corin. 12.</HI> If one member suffer, all suffer with him: if one member bee had in honor, al the members bée glad also. I doe not iudge my selfe bounde to you onely, as one member to another, as the foote to the hand, and eare to the eye, but I acknowledge my selfe a seruant vnto all men, and that I am borne to the ende I shoulde doe good vnto all with counselling, teaching, and reléeuing their necessities to the vttermost of my power, chiefly mée to whom hee hath com∣mitted his talent. And I being thus admonished with this lesson of Saint Paule, when I was about xxv. yéeres olde, It chaunced that I tooke in hand this paines, not without great care and dili∣gence to gather together examples out of diuers Authours, wher∣by I might admonishe and instruct aswell fathers and maisters, as children and seruants of their dueties, séeing that I iudged this kinde of doctrine very profitable for both: and that the chiefe parte of mans happinesse in this life floweth out of this fountaine. And to the end that this my paines might bée more profitable vnto all men, I began to collect from all partes of the best Authours, diuers Sayings, Examples, Apothegmes, Similitudes, Comparisons, &amp; the most apt sentences, which séemed to apperteine or tende any thing at all, to the instructing either of parents or children in their seuerall dueties. And these are gathered chiefly out of the sacred writings of the Prophets and Apostles.</P>
<P>Moreouer, I haue chosen and selected out of the writinges of godly fathers such things as I haue thought méete for this purpose whereunto lastly I haue ioyned also very many things out of the Philosophers, which might▪ séeme any thing profitable to godly housholders, So that I haue indeuoured in this my studie, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">The workes commended.</NOTE> my collection might increase to a reasonable volume, without doubt very profitable and necessary for fathers, mothers, and children, wherein as in a most cleare glasse, they may plainely sée what is their seuerall dueties.</P>

<P>Oh right happie and fortunate day, in the which it hath chaunced mee to enioy your presence and speech, would God I might haue conue∣nient time to stay with you, and to heare those thinges, that you with so great paines and diligence haue collected I say, if this might be brought to passe, I should then haue good hope, that it should bee verie profitable both to my selfe, and also to my family, and that if afterwardes I might heare from you the interpretation and apt applying of those things which you haue thus gathered together, I should iudge my selfe more happie a great deale, nay rather persuade my selfe, to be altogether deliuered from all those perils and daungers which to me and mine are imminent.</P>

<P>Syr, I most hartily thanke you, or rather God, that hath giuen you so willing a minde. But yet Syr I beseech you before we proceede any fur∣ther, that we may sende for <HI>Theophilus</HI> our neighbour and verie friende, who (as you know) is a man of an excellent wit and verie good memorie, a louer of godly admonitions, and learned both in the Greeke and latine tongue: I verely am vnlearned, of dul wit and no memorie, so that he wil demaund many thinges of you, which I should not once think of. Wher∣fore if it please you, we wil come to you tomorrowe, in the meane time I wil certefie him hereof, whereby he may heare you with better atten∣tion, and demaund of you more aptly the thinges that are conuenient, I in the meane while wil giue my selfe to silence, so that with some profite I may heare your godly communication, and commit the same to memorie with all that I may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can not but greatly commend this your wholsome counsell, vndoubtedly all things shall haue good successe, if <HI>Theophilus</HI> will vouchsafe to handle this kinde of argument with mée, for we haue conferred many thinges heretofore, concerning the education of children: therefore you haue done well to put mée in remembrance of him, But for that the night approcheth, let vs prepare our selues to rest, and call vpon God with heartie and feruent prayers, that hée wil graunt tomorrow, that I may so speake, and you so heare,

as that his glorie may be set foorth, and the good state of many fa∣milies increased.</P>

<P>Syr, according to your appointment yesterday, I haue not feared to come vnto you with our verie friend <HI>Theophilus,</HI> and haue also brought with mee <HI>Martina</HI> my welbeloued wife, that shee might in like manner heare, and perfectly vnderstand your godly admonitions, for this is with∣out all controuersie, shee must shewe her selfe aswell a Mother, as I a Fa∣ther, vnto our family. And for this cause, by the commandement of God, shee is no lesse bounde to doe her duetie, than I mine: and this can shee not doe, except shee be first taught of some bodie.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are all most hartily welcome, &amp; chiefly you (O my good<NOTE PLACE="marg">The family is committed to the wife, aswell as the husband.</NOTE> <HI>Martina</HI>) and I can you thanke, that you haue followed the wise counsell of your husband, for it is most certain, that your children and family are as well committed vnto your charge, as vnto your husbande.</P>

<SPEAKER>Martina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reuerend sir, I beleeue nothing to be truer, than that you haue said, and for that cause am I come hither, to heare your godly cōference, wher∣by I might the rather learne, how to accomplish and performe my duetie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amusus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Syr, yesterstay I was so rauished with your wordes, and had such great ioy &amp; pleasure in them, that I was once minded to haue brought all my children with mee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theophilus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good neighbour <HI>Amuse,</HI> tomorrow shal bee more conuenient for that purpose, when we shal treate of their dueties (that is to say) the ho∣nour and obedience that children owe vnto their Parents: for then shal it be good that you bring them all, because it shal bee verie profitable for them.</P>

Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The argument diuided into si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> partes.</NOTE> wée will set before you howe horrible and pernitious a thing it is, when Parentes neglect their dueties. Fiftly, wee will declare that children are often punished for the offences of Parentes. Sixtly, and lastly, wée will let you vnderstande of certaine vices, from the which your children are to be feared. Of these points seuerally (by the assistance of almightie God, without whō we can doe nothing) with the greatest diligence and wisedome that wée may, wée will speake in order, and those thinges which wée cannot finish in one day, wée will end them in two or thrée. And there is no labour so painefull, neither charges so great, which for your sakes I haue not willingly purposed to bestow. For amongst friends, all things are common.</P>

<P>And I also for this your good wil doe thinke my selfe greatly bound vnto you, for I perceiue this your purpose shal be profitable and necessarie for mee, I would there were more of our friendes present, to take the be∣nefite of your counsels together with vs. When <HI>Amusus</HI> came to me ye∣sternight, and shewed mee in what you had communicated vnto him tou∣ching this matter, I was more glad (so God helpe mee) than if a man had powred into my lappe many millians of gold.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would it might please God, to grant vs many of your mind and towardnesse: but ah las, I feare me that the most men do more estéeme millians, nay rather one millian of golde, than the counsell and admonitions of their faithfull friends, though neuer so learned and godly. The world is now set on such folly, vndoubtedly most like vnto the Asse, that had rather to féede on the dry Barly straw, then of good wheate, were it neuer so swéete and pleasaunt. But I will omit these thinges, and returne to my purpose: And for be∣cause mariage is the original and fountaine of all priuate and pub∣like gouernment, I will touch some thinges, of the beginning, ex∣cellencie, and end thereof. Mariage is properly a lawfull and godly<NOTE PLACE="marg">The definition of mariage.</NOTE> ioyning together of one man, and one woman, ordeined to the ser∣uice of God, for the procreation and vertuous educatiō of children, to the preseruation of his Church and common wealth.

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Godly Matrimony was ordeined of God him selfe, and that in the terrestriall Paradise, a place full of all ioy and pleasure in the time of mans innocencie, and was adorned &amp; bewtified with great miracles in Cana of Galalie, where Christ him selfe vou∣chedsafe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. 2.</NOTE> to be present at the mariage with his mother Marie the virgine, and his Disciples, and with his diuine power turned the water into excellent good and most pure Wine, which was highly commended of the Maister of the feast, by whose presence and mi∣racle is plainly testified, that lawful mariage pleaseth him greatly, and it is certaine that God doeth blesse the mariage of those that feare him and call vpon him faithfully. And Saint Paul highly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mariage doth please God.</NOTE> commend, that holie and lawfull coupling of man and wife toge∣ther, saying thus: Mariage is honourable among all men, and the bed vndefiled. Wherefore I may boldly and fréely affirme, that mariage is the most excellent state and condition of life, instituted of God, preserued and garnished with his blessing, which all the godly both by preaching and example haue commended vnto vs, and placed the same in the toppe of all good workes.</P>

<P>Saint Peter sayeth, Yée husbandes dwell with your wyues according to knowledge, in giuing honour to the woman, as to the weaker vessell, and that your prayers be not hindred. This com∣maundement properly belongeth vnto the man, because hée is the head and Authour of the nourishing and confirming this concorde, which shal by this meanes come to passe, if hée vse a milde and mo∣derate kind of gouernmēt, &amp; not a tyrannous: sometime pardoning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good lesson<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for husbandes and wiues.</NOTE> the womā, because she is y<SUP>•</SUP> weaker creature, not indued with like fortitude, &amp; greatnesse of courage: but yet it is not the wiues parte to abuse the moderation, curtesie and lenitie of her husband. For the wiues faire and gentle spéech, and modest silence, shal quiet and pacifie much chiding and brawling. It is also the wiues dueties to know and consider their owne weakenesse &amp; infirmitie of nature. And that I might comprehend much matter in fewe wordes, the most excellent duetie of godly maried persons, is to solicite and call<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dueties of godly couples.</NOTE> vpon God with heartie prayers verie often, that hée would vouch∣safe to be present with them, and that they might continually nou∣rish concord and mutuall good wil betwéene them: and with great diligence, that they accustome them selues to lenitie and gentle∣nesse, bearing one with an other, and studie to take in good parte whatsoeuer shall chaunce, and so shall their conuersation bée most pleasaunt and ioyfull together. Forthermore, if afflictions, con∣tentions, or any other euils (which the Deuil is wont to thrust vp∣on the maried persons) do assaile them, and séeme to be imminent: straight way that both of them with their eyes lift vp into heauen, doe desire Gods aide &amp; protection, &amp; cease not from prayer till they finde some comfort, for the Lord is readie at hand to those that call vpō him in faith, without douting. For Christ himself saith, Where two vpon the earth do agrée together, whatsoeuer they shal aske of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 18.</NOTE> my heauenly Father, it shall be graunted vnto them. Prayer is most necessary in so great perils &amp; daungers of life, neither is there any thing more séemely &amp; pleasant in the house, than to sée &amp; behold an honest &amp; godly societie, of the husband, wife, &amp; children, whē they striue in their seuerall dueties, to loue cherish, &amp; comfort one an o∣ther,
<PB REF="10"/>
that they talke vpon God, and of his benefites, that they call vpon him with one voice, and haue a care that the knowledge and true worship of God may be set foorth. And lastly, that the Parents hold not this doctrine only in wordes, but also by example of life.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put me well in remembrance, for as the procreatiō of chil∣dren<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Procre∣ation of chil∣dren.</NOTE> is the gift of God, so is it the proper office of true and lawfull wedlocke, which alwayes for the most part, doeth waite theron, as an inseperable companion, which hath the blessing of God, as wit∣nesseth she scripture. <HI>Gene. 1.</HI> where as Moses saith: God blessed them and said: increase and multiply, and replenish the earth.

<P>Verie wisely and worthily spoken, fors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing that the procreation of children is not the common gift of God, it is not without cause, that wee ought to bestow al our paines &amp; diligence, that youth may bee brought vp in the feare &amp; word of God. But in what words hath God commaunded and inioyned vnto vs this diligent education, and instruction of children?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The God of Israell, beginneth after this maner. <HI>Deut. 4.</HI> saying, Be not forgetfull of the words which thine eyes haue séene, &amp; that they slip not out of thine heart, all the dayes of thy life, Thou shalt teach them thy sonnes, and thy sonnes sonnes, saying, When thou stodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord saide vn∣to mée, gather mée the people together, and I wil make them heare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> wordes, that they may learne to feare mée, all the dayes that they shall line vpon the earth, &amp; that they may teach their children.
<PB REF="11"/>
And againe, These wordes which I commaund thée this day, shall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6.</NOTE> be in thine heart, and thou shalt shewe them vnto thy children, and shalt talke of them when thou art at home sitting in thine house, and as thou walkest by the way, and when thou lyest downe, and when thou risest vp: And thou shalt binde them for a signe vpon thine hand. And they shal be warninges betwéene thine eyes, and thou shalt write them vpon the postes of thine house, and vpon thy gates. And in the 11. Chapter he saith: Therfore shal ye lay vp these<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eodem. 11.</NOTE> my words in your heart &amp; in your soule, &amp; bind them for a signe vpō your hands, &amp; set them before your eyes, teach them your children, that they may talke of them, when thou sittest in thine house: And when thou walkest by the way: when thou liest down, &amp; whē thou risest vp: yea, &amp; thou shalt write them vpon thy doore postes of thine house, &amp; vpon thy gates, y<SUP>t</SUP> your dayes &amp; the dayes of your children may be multiplied.

Behold, y<SUP>e</SUP> truth hateth not the light, but wil be manifested in all things. Therefore the Prophet is not cōtent to teach the people of his time, but doeth desire y<SUP>t</SUP> they might be taught vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> end of the world: And he doeth exhort them, y<SUP>t</SUP> one generation might teach &amp; instruct an other. And now, albeit that very many Parents at this day (my <HI>Theophilus</HI>) do lightly regard y<SUP>e</SUP> teaching &amp; instructing of their children: yet how earnestly, the instructing of them is charged &amp; commaunded here, your self may easily iudge. So y<SUP>t</SUP> when I do bewaile sometime the negligēce of many parents, I oft burst out into these wordes. Alas, vnto what end would the education of children haue come, if there had béen no commandement, nor order prescribed for the same▪ By this we may gather, none other thing, then excéeding darknesse and confusion of minde: &amp; that the nature of mankinde should haue vt∣terly béen defiled, which so shamefully contemneth her children of her own self begotten &amp; borne, whom God &amp; nature neuerthelesse would haue beloued &amp; carefully regarded: As these places also fol∣lowing, doe manifestly shewe &amp; witnesse. Thou that hast children,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccle.</HI> 7.

And againe he saieth, Teach thy some, &amp; be diligent therin, least it be to thy shame: The whole Chapiter is worth the reading. We finde a like commandement in Solomō, which saith,
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
Chasten thy sonne, whiles there is some hope of his amendement. And Saint Paule is not vnmindfull of this godly precept, saying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 6.</NOTE> Bring vp your children in instruction and information of the Lorde. Paule woulde haue young men and children brought vp, first, by instruction, and then by correction in the Lorde, which rea∣sons and orders if they were of euery Parent diligently obserued, it coulde not bée why at this day so many families (vtterly spoyled and ouerthrowne) should bée lamented. Such is the infinite good∣nesse, care, and great loue of God towardes vs, who doeth not on∣ly send vs children: but also most diligently setteth before vs, the forme and order how we shall nurture and correct them.</P>

<P>The father which desireth y<SUP>•</SUP> his sōne should not only be adorned in the vertues of the mind, but also would haue him wel instructed in an honest and ciuill maner of life, ought to observe diligently, that hée be carefully instructed and exercised in certeine precepts of good manners.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wée must deale with children, that they be taught by litle and litle, like as when wée would fill a narrow mouthed vessell: For if wée powre in a great deale of licour at once, it runneth ouer on euerie side, but if wée will powre it in faire and softly, as it were through a fonnell, it will be filled vnto the brimme. <HI>Plantae quum</HI>

<P>These thinges are no lesse wisely, than eligantly spoken: But yet if you haue any other Methode of teaching, I pray you shewe it vnto vs.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Children, in good Artes, and vnto good and godly studies, are to be drawne: some with praise, and through hope of preferment: o∣thers with small giftes, and inticements: others are to be compel∣led<NOTE PLACE="marg">Optimaratio iustituendi.</NOTE> with threatnings and stripes. <HI>Pueri bonis artibus, ad bona re∣cta{que} studia sunt inducendi: alij laude, &amp; per spem honoris: alij munu∣sculis blandicijs{que} alliciendi; minis alij flagris{que} cogendi erunt.</HI> But yet all these thinges must be so duely considered, and by reason gui∣ded and moderated, that in ordering of wittes, Parents and Tea∣chers doe vse great Art and skil, and beware that they be neither too gentle, nor too seuere. For as too much libertie and cockering mar∣reth a towarde wit: so too sharpe and ouermuch chastisement, dul∣leth the same, and quickly extinguisheth the litle sparkes of nature in children, which while they feare all thinges, dare attempt no∣thing. And so commeth it to passe, that they alwayes erre, whilest that they feare, they shall faile in euerie thing.</P>

<P>The chiefest duetie of parents is, that they carefully prouide to<NOTE PLACE="marg">De nobili of∣ficio paren∣tum.</NOTE> haue their children taught in the word of God from their infancie, and to instruct them in their dueties towards God, &amp; also towards themselues. And séeing the darknes of mans mind is so wonderful, it is necessary, that parentes sée their children taught in the Cate∣chisme (that is to say) in the true doctrine of the law &amp; Gospeh from their tender yeares: that the holie Ghost may haue a place and in∣strument, through the ministration of parents, wherby he may in∣fuse his gifts into the childrens mindes: And thus shal they not on∣ly moue them with wordes, but also stirre them vp by their good ex∣amples: This is their vocation, this is that duetie that God requi∣reth of thē. Therfore they shall indeudur themselues, that they liue godly, in the sight of God &amp; of their children, that they be merciful, gentle and louing vnto the poore, not to care for this only, that they leaue their children rich &amp; wealthie when they are at the pointe to die, but rather that they leaue them to Gods prouidence: for y<SUP>e</SUP> earth is ful of the goodnes of the Lord. And as Dauid saieth: I haue béene<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 36. 37.</NOTE> young &amp; now am old, &amp; yet saw I neuer the righteous forsaken, nor their séede neuer begging bread.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theophilus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I gather of your speech, that God doeth exact of Parences, that as by wordes, so in like manner by godly examples they ought to instruct their children. But what is there more required of good &amp; godly Parentes?</P>

<P>This paine and charge lieth vpon Parentes, and for this cause chiefly are they appointed of God, that they teache &amp; bring vp their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe, 6,</NOTE> childrē, not according to their own fātasies, &amp; as séemeth best to thē selues, but after the cōmādement of God.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better to bée without, and neuer to haue any, than to haue wicked and vngodly children, I reade of <HI>Epaminundas</HI> an excellent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of degenerate children.</NOTE> wise man, and of great authoritie in his time, which did neuer ma∣ry: and when at a certaine time one <HI>Pelopides</HI> a friend of his did re∣proue him therfore, because hée could leaue behind him no sonnes in whom hée might sow the séedes of his vertues, therefore hée pro∣uided very euill for his countrie: <HI>Epaminundas</HI> smiling thereat an∣swered: Take héede you prouide not worse for the same, which shal leaue behind you so wicked a son: by w<SUP>t</SUP> words this wiseman sheweth, y<SUP>•</SUP> parēts should feare nothing more, then y<SUP>•</SUP> they shoulde haue &amp; leaue behind thē degenerate childrē either in body or mind. Erasmus saith, A mans minde in a beastly body, is a monster to bée abhorred, as wée read of <HI>Circes,</HI> that with her poisons coulde trans∣forme men into Lions, Beares, and swine: Who could abide saith <HI>Augustine</HI> to bée called the father of such a monster? But a beastly mind in a mans body is more monstrous. And yet there are many (in their own iudgements, and in the iudgement of cōmon people very wise) which content themselues with such issue, and thinke them no degenerat children (and that very truely) for they digresse

Whosoeuer therfore hath taken vpon him the office of gouerning others, let him take héed least he disdain or neglect the same with being giuē to idlenes &amp; drowsines, or that he leaue not y<SUP>e</SUP> flock wherof he taketh charge, to be spoyled with wolues, &amp; the blood of the lost shéep be required at his handes: but if any prouide not for his owne, &amp; speciall for thē of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P><HI>Socrates</HI> setteth downe a verie good order, saying: wée must deale with them, as wée woulde doe with those Horses, in which wée see great courage, good proportion of limmes, countenance &amp; pace: if straight from their tender yeares wée watch them, handle them carefully, and breake them orderly, they are like to proue excellent for the Saddle, and verie profitable to serue their maisters turn, in all his exploits and néedfull businesse, either for profite or pleasure: But if they be neglected and suffered to runne ouer long, then they become wilde, int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actable, and profitable to no good vse or purpose: And hereof it commeth to passe, that those Coltes which by all signes were like to proue verie good and profitable, are spoyled by the ignoraunce and vnskilfulnes of the breaker, which straight frō good &amp; comely horses, are cōuerted &amp; chaunged into very Asses: For

like as the earth, the better it is and more fertile by nature, the soo∣ner it will be spoiled and ouergrowne with wéedes, nettles, &amp; bry∣ers, if it be not orderly tilled, manured, and dressed: Euen so the forwarder and nobler wittes, except they be the better ordred and instructed, will the sooner be inclined to wickednes, and obdusked, and defaced with many vices.

<P>Our Lorde God in whose handes wée are all, which also lo∣ueth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Children are to be corrected.</NOTE> our children excéedingly, prouideth for them, and kéepeth them verie carefully, which of the children of his wrath, hath made vs the children of God, and would haue vs to be the heires of his cele∣stiall kingdome, through the precious blood of his dearely beloued Sonne Iesus Christ: Euen the same God I say, woulde not only that our children and youthes should be vertuously &amp; godly brought vp and instructed: but would also haue them continually preserued and kept vnder the same godly discipline and correction. For cor∣rection is no lesse necessarie &amp; profitable for children, than instructi∣on: which these places doe clearely make manifest, that I will re∣site here in order, in the which God doeth set foorth his will vnto vs concerning this pointe. For Solomon saieth: <HI>Noli subtrahere a</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 23.</NOTE> <HI>puero tuo disciplinam, si enim percusseris eum virga, non morietur: tu virga percuties eum &amp; animam eius ab inferno liberabis. <HI>Withholde</HI></HI>

<HI>not correction from thy childe, for if thou smitest him with the rodde, he shal not die thereof: thou smitest him with the rodde, but thou shalt de∣liuer his soule from hell.</HI> This sentence doeth not only conteine a pre∣cept, but also a most comfortable promise.

<P>Seeing that our Lord God, hath commaunded vs so often and so ear∣nestly the chastening of our youthes, maruel it is, that Parents, do so spoile and marre their children with nice pampering, and too much cockering of them: and chiefly seeing that they are stirred vp vnto the performance of their dueties with most louing and sweete promises. For to those Parents, which vse due correction vnto their children, the Lorde God doeth pro∣mise a sweete and ioyful life, yea, in their old age: which benefit cannot be obteined with gold, siluer, nor any other treasure though it be of neuer so great price or value.

<P>As, to those Parents (which carefully perfourme their dueties in correcting their children) there are promised great ioyes both of bodie and minde: So they are compelled to beare and suffer great shame and griefe of minde, which without any regarde of fatherly admonitions and corrections, permit &amp; suffer their childe to growe vp in all lewdnesse and disobedience, as by these texts doe appeare. <HI>Puer qui demittitur voluntati suae, confundit matrem suam, &amp; rursū:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Confusio matris est de filio indisciplinato. <HI>The childe that is suffred to runne after his owne wil, doeth shame his mother,</HI></HI> and againe: <HI>A rude and vnmannerly sonne, shal be a reproch to his mother. <HI>Dolor patris</HI></HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 4.</NOTE> <HI>filius stultus: melior est puer pauper &amp; sapiens, rege sene &amp; stulto: fi∣lius sapiēs laetificat patrem, filius vero stultus, maestitia est matris suae.</HI>

For howe shall the children perfourme their dueties towardes their Parents, if that parents shall first neglect their dueties towardes their children? And albeit the slouth and negligence of parents doeth not excuse the wickednesse and impietie of children before God, notwithstan∣ding parents owe this duetie to their children, that they prouide for them not only corporall foode for their bodies: but much rather spirituall foode and nourishment for their soules, if otherwise they couet and desire to haue them saued.</P>

<P>Truely, it is an harde and fearfull sentence, wherout all young men may gather, as is méet for them, how great the wrath of God is against the sinne of disobedience.

<P>Concerning this negligent instruction of children, there are so many waightie and graue sayings, and such horrible and fearefull examples euerie where, as well in the holy scriptures, as also in o∣ther godly Authours, and Heathen writers, that if I should goe a∣bout to shewe and declare vnto you euery thing that I haue reade and noted, touching the same, a whole day would not suffice.

<P>If oportunitie and leysure doe not serue, to shewe vs euerie thing as you wish, yet at the least, you wil vouchsafe wee pray you, to recite suche thinges as may seeme more sharply to admonishe, and as it were, compell negligent Parentes, that (at the last, this filthie drowsinesse, and pernitious negligence being shaken off,) they may more diligently and carefully dis∣charge their dueties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Men might easily be drawne to the duties of their vocation and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against negli∣gent parents.</NOTE> calling, if they were throughly persuaded, and woulde beléeue that their children are the gift of God, and that they are the pledges of God him selfe, neither néeded they any compulsion in this matter: But rather verie willingly, and of their owne accords, would they credit and beléeue, that these pledges of God, ought with great care and diligence to be preserued, instructed, and corrected: For it they shall be neglected, spoiled, or lost by their meanes and sufferaunce, then shall they be required at the handes of the Treasuror and kée∣per. Nowe for example sake, a King or Emperour, hath his Trea∣surer, or some one of his Priuie Chamber, to whom hée commit∣teth many thinges of great charge and value, to be kept, preserued, and diligently looked vnto. Suppose and thinke it to be a precious Crowne, most worthie for a Prince, the Imperiall Scepter, Letters Pattentes, precious Stones, Pearles, Iewels, and other riche and costly Robes, which are moste commonly woont to be in kings and Emperours palaces. I say, He that shal carefully kéepe,

and diligently preserue these thinges, according to the trust in him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the pledges of God.</NOTE> reposed, shall not only of the King or Emperour be esteemed and greatly beloued, but also at the last, promoted vnto great dignitie, and woorthely rewarded. But if this Chamberlayne or Trea∣surer shall neglect his duetie and office, or spoile and lose those most precious Iewels and ornaments of the King or Emperour. Then shall hée not only lose his office, but also be depriued and dispoiled of all his possessions, goods, and Cattels, and besides, that suffer most extreame punishment.

<P>I doe not so much maruel, that such corrupters of youth were found amongst the Heathen which liued without the light of the Gospel, and true knowledge of God: but that this chaunceth very often amongest those men, which boast themselues to bee good and perfect Christians, this is much rather to bee maruelled at, and by no meanes to bee suffered.

Mothers take no regarde, no care of their daughters, but winke at their faultes, suffer them to rome abrode, seeke their amendment by no milde nor moderate correction, neither doe they perswade them vnto sobrie∣tie, mildnesse, nor modestie, with their wholesome admonitions and mo∣therly counsels. Wee haue greater care, and will take more paines a great deale about any thing els, then about the godly education of our children. I am perswaded that God is greatly offended with vs, euen for this one fault, that wee deale so negligently with our children, and cast the raines of al libertie and loosenesse into their owne necks after this maner:

<P>Without all doubt a horrible punishment remaineth to suche Parents, which so negligently contemne and despise their owne naturall children, besides that it is a very great negligence, or ra∣ther a horrible mischiefe, either to cast the bridle into the neckes of young men, or to corrupt and spoyle them with wicked instruction or their owne lewde and naughtie examples.

wicked and iniurious to themselues, but also to their whole fami∣lies, so that suche shall receiue double the greater condenination. It is set downe in the Decalogue or tenne Commaundementes, That children woulde honour their Parents, but with what face dare that Father exact of his child the honour commaunded of God in the second Table, when as hée himselfe doth not perfourme his owne duetie, which in the first Table of the Commaundements is required of him, touching the due honour of God, and the sancti∣fying of the Sabboth day? Children are not borne of their parents at auenture, but they bée the gift and blessing of God.

<P>Therefore, what is more cruell, what is more horrible or<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the inhe∣ritance of y<SUP>•</SUP> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣uenly life being lost, is recoue∣red by the pa∣rentes.</NOTE> mōstrous, then such a father, which after he hath children, doth not apply all his whole studie and indeuour to this ende chiefly, that hée may recouer againe the right of that Heauenly inheritaunce before loste as is said▪ For except this bée brought to passe, what other thing doe children gaine by their Parents, but hell and euer∣lasting death.</P>

<P>I doe not altogether mislike or despise your opinion, notwithstanding<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is the chiefe of mans felicitie?</NOTE> in the meane time, I thinke and iudge that it is not vnprofitable if suche negligent Parentes should be admonished, and the rather, for because the good &amp; vertuous education of children, is a thing so worthie &amp; so neces∣sarie, that if a man wil account it the verie fountaine and whole summe of mans felicitie, I iudge hee should not be greatly deceiued.

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is euen so in déed, you haue read and remembred very well, <HI>Solon,</HI> that most wise lawe maker set foorth a sore sharpe and gree∣uous lawe, to kéepe Parents in their dueties, and they tooke great care of their childrē to be kept according to the prescript rule of the same, So that if they had let passe or forgot any thing, &amp; being moo∣ued either with couetousnes or any other wickednes, had violated and broken the good purpose and meaning of the lawe, touching the education and instructing of their children. There were paynes<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solons</HI> law was verie sharpe a∣gainst negligent Parents.</NOTE> prescribed and set downe, and gréeuous feare of iudgement, to the which it was lawfull for any man that was willing, to bring thē, that woulde complaine of such a father. Moreouer, their lawful authoritie was taken from them, which nature by the lawe of hu∣manitie had giuen them, and that the childe did owe to his father: For neither was hée compelled to regard nor reuerence such a one, nor to sustaine, cherishe, comfort or relieue him with his goods or mony, no though hée were poore, sicke, féeble, or indigent. To con∣clude, who so did not throughly perfourme the office and duetie of a good father towards his childe, the lawe would not that any due∣tie should remaine &amp; abide in his force &amp; authoritie from the childe either of naturall loue and affection, or of a thankfull and willing minde towardes such a father.</P>

<P>It was an extreame lawe, and they were greeuous paines no doubt, which would haue all humanitie, authoritie, and loue (which is due vnto Parentes) to be as it were extinguished &amp; vtterly rooted out of the hearts of children.

<P>They doe dissent &amp; disagrée from mine opinion, I must néedes confesse: but yet I affirme that those Parents are not to be cōstrai∣ned, which haue professed them selues Christians, and which haue béene truely taught and instructed in the true faith and knowledge of God, and are not altogether <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say) estraunged from a naturall and fatherly affection, such (as I haue saide) are not to be compelled: For there is great difference betwéene a true

<P>When I sée those Parentes offende as gréeuously (which not∣withstanding glorie and boast them selues to be dipped and dyed in the blood of Christ) as the Infidels, and haue as litle care and re∣garde of their children: And are not only equall with the Gentils, but also doe farre excéede them in that faulte, I might easily bée persuaded, that they shoulde bée vrged and constrained vnto their dueties: For albeit litle fruite from them were to be looked for, yet this lawe might be an example vnto others, which might be exci∣ted and stirred vp, vnto a greater diligence and carefulnesse to∣wardes their children, and chiefly when they did heare the instruc∣tion and vertuous education of children so earnestly commaunded of God: which when it is rightly taught, setteth foorth the glorie of God excéedingly, and is most necessarie and profitable as wel to the common wealth generally, yea as also to all families perticularly. Wherefore as I haue often sayde héeretofore, so I now say againe, that diligent care and regard is to be had about this first age: which the porche and entraunce of life, sheweth it selfe, as it were, a cer∣teine platforme, and frame or whole building of the yeares fol∣lowing.</P>

<P>For that you haue so diligently dissolued this doubt, and so plainly declared and made manifest this question vnto vs, we haue to reioyce and giue you hartie thankes, If I remember wel the matter going before, you proued by the testimonies of godly &amp; learned men, that Parēts run in great daunger which shal not bring vp and chasten their children vertuously and

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gather my reasons very rightly.

<P>The most perfect order of bringing vp children (as witnesseth<NOTE PLACE="marg">A declaration of Saint Paules wordes. <HI>Educat libe∣ros per erudi∣tionem et cor∣reptionem.</HI></NOTE> Paul) doth depend vpon two things (that is to say) of godly instru∣ction and moderate correction. And it apperteineth vnto erudi∣tion that Parents from their tender yéeres shewe and set before them, the Almightie power, goodnesse, and clemencie of our moste mercifull God, and put them often in remembrance of his innu∣merable benefites, which hée bestoweth vpon them most bountiful∣ly, aswell for the furniture of their bodies, as also for the adorning and garnishing of their soules, and thus dayly more and more doth hée binde them vnto him through his bountifull liberalitie. For the giftes and benefites aswell of the body as of the minde, are ex∣ceeding<NOTE PLACE="marg">What, and how greate benefits children doe re∣ceaue from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> parents.</NOTE> great, as strength, agilitie, and health of body, and what so∣euer serueth both to the outward and inwarde garnishing of the same. And this is not to bée thought one of the least benefites, that it was his goodwill and pleasure that wee shoulde bée borne, not of the Heathen Infidels, and of wicked &amp; vngodly, but of god∣ly, faithful, and christian parents, which haue caused vs to be bap∣tized, that so being washed and bathed in the Lauer of regenerati∣on, by the precious blood of Iesus Christ, and cleansed from the fil∣thinesse of our sinne (wherein wée were conceiued and borne) are nowe ingraffed and haue societie in the fellowship and company of all the children of God, and faithfull seruants of Christe.</P>

much with them, so that it be done with great aduisement, counsel, and consideration (that is to say) if Parents shal first diligently in∣struct their children in the true knowledge &amp; reuerend fear of God, and that the same be surely setled, and most firmely fixed in their heartes, that it may not be easily remooued, and they caried away with euerie vaine blast of blasphemous doctrine, and hatefull He∣resies, which shal soone be blowne aswel into their outward eares, as also into their inward mindes, wherwith their hearts shalbe so infected, that both bodie &amp; minde shal soone be out of all good course. Wherof all the Patriarkes and Prophets had great regard, as we may reade in their Bookes, which haue most diligently and care∣fully taught and instructed their children in the feare of God, fore∣tolde them of perilles and daungers, and discouraged them from the company and fellowship of wicked men, as wée may sée by the example of <HI>Beniamin,</HI> which was alwayes kepte at home of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gene. 42.</NOTE> his father Iacob.

<P>In mine opinion, it is most necessarie and best agréeing to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mothers oght to nourish their children with their owne dugges.</NOTE> nature of the childe, that mothers nourish and giue sucke to their owne children; with their owne dugges and breastes: for mothers with a greater care and diligence will cherish them, and are moued therunto with a certain intire loue, &amp; naturall affection, for y<SUP>•</SUP> they are of them bread &amp; born. And therfore they haue often this prouerb in their mouthes: It is a neare collop, that is cut from their owne flesh: So that the mothers loue is vnfained But these Nurses vse no true, but fained &amp; dissembled loue, because they are hirelings and so by y<SUP>•</SUP> meanes: vrged to practise &amp; vse their kindnesse, for gaine and lucer sake. And <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI> saith: <HI>Optima mater non permittat ali∣ouius</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aulus Gol.</NOTE> <HI>lactis contagione filiū suum infici. <HI>A good mother cannot abide nor suffer her childe to bee infected with the contagion of a straungers milke.</HI></HI> And nature her selfe doeth euidently declare and shewe, that mo∣thers ought to cherish with their owne milke those, whiche they haue ingendred and borne. And therefore nature hath giuen to euerie liuing beast that bringes foorth young, power to nourishe and comforte the same, with their owne milke. And God by his great prouidence and inscrutable wisedome, hath prouided and giuen vnto women two breastes, that if it shoulde fortune at one trauayle, they shoulde be deliuered of two children, that then they might haue two fountaynes for their better nourishing. Great rare therefore must bée imployed, and paynes bestowed, that the verie mothers them selues (as I haue sayde) doe nourishe and bring vp their infantes with their owne breastes and mylke.</P>
<P><PB REF="58"/>For the benefite of the mothers milke, hath wrought suche great effect, rewarde and merite with our elders, that whensoeuer the mothers haue desired any harde or difficult thing at the handes of their children, they haue euer desired and requested the same after this maner, that (for the tender loue they beare vnto them in their infancie, when they nourished and suckled them euen with the milke of their owne breastes, with great care and diligence, mix∣ed sometime with sorrowe, and the oft abridging of their wonted pleasures, with the abandoning of many swéete sléepes) they wold graunt their requestes.

But at the last when the childe was dead, and that his scruauntes durst not tell him.

But Dauid perceiuing his Seruauntes whyspering, and thought that the Childe was dead, and sayde vnto them, is the Childe dead? They sayde yea.

Hée sayde, while the childe was yet aliue, I fasted and wepte. For this I thought, who can tell, whether GOD will haue mercie on mée, that the Childe may liue.

<P>Our vnlearned youth haue alwaies supposed and thought, that true honour hath consisted in the putting of their Cappe, and making of cur∣tesie, and that there is none other thing due vnto Parents: Wherefore wee woulde bee right glad to heare further of you, what it is to honor Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>To honor Parents, is to déeme and iudge honorably of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it is to honour &amp;c.</NOTE> for that God hath made vs subiect vnto them, for by the determi∣nate will and appointment of God, they are to gouerne, and we to obey. And therefore with all our heartes, wee must submit our selues vnto their wisedome, iustice, iudgement and authoritie. And albeit they shall sometime offend and erre in performing their du∣ties (as it is the nature of all men) yet must wée pardon, excuse, and couer their faultes most louingly and reuerently. For wheras Saint Paule saith: Honor thy father and mother &amp;c. Hée requireth
<PB REF="68"/>
this one thing of children, that with all their heartes, they loue, re∣uerence, &amp; ayde their parents to the vttermost of their power, and also those to whom their Parents haue committed them, that is to say, Magistrates, Elders, Preachers, Maisters, Teachers, Tu∣tors and such like. Therefore to honor Parents is not onely to sa∣lute them humbly, to speake to them louingly, and to vse them courteously, to put of the cappe before them, to giue them the way and vpper hand in euery place: But also the holy Scriptures doe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 6. Coll. 3. Heb. 12. 7. 9. Prou. 1. 4. 6. 8. 15. 17. &amp; 29.</NOTE> teach children to obey their parents, to serue them, to feare, loue, ho¦nor, and reuerence them, not only in wordes and outwarde shewe, but in their heartes and mindes also: To follow their godly pre∣cepts and examples of life: and paciently to take correctiō at their hands: To make continuall and heartie prayers vnto God for thē, and to relieue and nourish their Parentes in case they fall into po∣uertie and decay. And whē they are olde, to guide, lead, yea &amp; beare them on their shoulders if néede require and in all pointes by she∣wing themselues obedient and good children, to moue their Pa∣rents to bée louing and good vnto them.</P>

<P>True honour consisteth in this, that wée thinke and iudge wor∣thily<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what thinge the true honor of pa. doth con∣siste.</NOTE> of our parents, that wée regarde them most honorably, that wée yéelde and giue al reuerence vnto their authoritie and iudge∣ment: that wée neuer contemne or despise them, bée they neuer so poore, olde, and croked, yea, if they did séeme to dote, and were very wayward, to preferre the title and name of Father and mother, be∣fore all faults whatsoeuer. Neither to regard or estéeme what ma∣ner of parents, but to reioyce &amp; bée glad that we haue parents.

<P>You say very truely, for Parents are to bée honored after thrée sortes chiefly, First children shall truely loue their parentes with all their heartes and minde they shall giue vnto them all high dig∣nitie and reuerence: they shall so estéeme of them, as that no trea∣sure in the world ought to bée more deare and precious vnto them. Secondly they shall honour them with wordes and good maners, shewing vnto them all kinde of reuerence that may bée, they may not curse them, nor chat or mutter against them, but rather suffer them paciently, albeit they bée more waieward, hard, &amp; egar, than either reason or wisdom doth require. Thirdly, they must also ho∣nor them with their labor, paines &amp; trauel (that is to say) they shal helpe, relieue and prouide for them, both with their bodies &amp; goods: and in no wise suffer thē to be oppressed with pouertie and miserie when they growe aged. And children shall doe this, not onely wil∣lingly, but also reuerently, and with great lowlinesse of minde, as though this duetie and benefite, shoulde bée doone to God him selfe (as it is in very déed) &amp; they ought to be most thankful vnto God which hath thus preferred them to this worship and honour, and hath made them able thus to perfourme this duetie.</P>

<P>Fourthly, when now wée are growne vp, &amp; that it is time, that wée shoulde know, learne, and vnderstand the worde of God, then the Almightie God by our parents, doth deliuer vnto vs that most pure &amp; excellent doctrine (that is to say) the ten Commandements, the Simbole or Créede of the Apostles, and the Lordes prayer.

<P>Lastly, they doteach, or cause vs to be taught, som handiecraft, Science, Trade or Occupation, wherwith wée may honestly get our liuings, in that state &amp; condition of life, vnto the which it shall please God to appoint vs: by them wée haue our Countrie, then the which nothing is more swéete or deare vnto vs: by them wee inioy the benefite of the lawes of our Towne, Citie, &amp; Common Wealth, then the which nothing is more to bée obeyed: by them wée receiue and inioy our Patrimony and inheritance, then the which nothing is more to bée wished: Finally, what is it that wée doe not receiue by their meanes? So great paines and labour haue they in bringing vp their children, in framing, forming, tea∣ching, nurturing and adorning them, that they are not able fully to perfourme their dueties, woulde they neuer so faine: And these be the chiefest causes, why God doth commaund vs to honour our Parents. Therefore vndoubtedly they are very wicked children, which do not this (asmuch as they possible may) séeing they receiue so great an heape of benefites from their Parents.</P>

<P>My good <HI>Theodidactus,</HI> hitherto you haue instructed vs, that parents are not slightly to bee honored: but also you haue added heereunto, that they are reuerently to bee honored, with great submission and lowlines of minde, and to whom children ought to bee obedient, not as to men, but as to God himselfe. These things are not as yet sufficiently vnderstanded of these children, wherefore you had neede to explane and make manifest the same vnto vs more plainely.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although this sentence hath no scruple or doubt, yet with all my hearte wil I gratifie these young ones concerning this thing: there is a like saying of S. Paul touching seruants, to whom the Apostle speaketh after this maner: Seruants obey your bodily maisters, with feare &amp; trembling, in y<SUP>•</SUP> simplenes of your hearts, as to Christ<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 6. Coll. 3.</NOTE> himselfe, not with the eye seruice as pleasing men, but as seruing the Lorde Christ. And if seruants ought to obey their maisters, as the Lord God himself: ought not children much more to reuerence and obey their parents? But to the ende that these thinges may be the better vnderstood, I will vse a similitude for the better capacity of children. Euen as the chiefe maister cōmitteth his schollers vn∣to his vssher, to teach, guide, and gouerne them in his absence, to whom they owe the like reuerence for the time as to their maister And as the vssher doth sharply punish and correct their disobediēce<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parentes are Gods vicars in earth.</NOTE> if they offend, so doth y<SUP>•</SUP> Lord God gréeuously punish those children which do not obey their Parents: For he hath appointed parents to be his vsshers in his stéede for the training vp and instructing of children. Now God is the chiefest workmaister &amp; vssher, &amp; the pa∣rents are but meanes and instruments, by the which god worketh these things. Therfore parents are to be honored, loued, &amp; obeyed, because God will haue it so, who punisheth rebels, not as contem∣ners of men, but as railers of his will &amp; high maiestie, wherfore I woulde haue good children héereby admonished, least that they su∣fer themselues to be drawne of the Diuel into the sinne of disobe∣dience and rebellion.</P>

<P>You giue vs very wise and godly counsell, but wee knowe that there is so greate malice ingendered in the mindes of children, that they fall

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I iudge no remedy to bée more effectuall for this purpose, then if they set before their eyes the feare of plagues &amp; punishmentes, and that by this meanes they may bée brideled; and restrayned frō<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disobedient children are ac∣cursed of God.</NOTE> these rashe assaultes and giddie attemptes and that they accustome themselues to loue and cherish discipline, that they may be obediēt to their parents, and to all pollitike gouernment. And let them as∣sure themselues that God will punish their pride, their malapert∣nesse, and contempt of discipline, as we sée in <HI>Caine,</HI> which is accur∣sed. In the sonnes of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and <HI>Heli, Absolon</HI> and <HI>Siba</HI> which moued sedition against <HI>Dauid,</HI> and therefore were destroyed. It should bée very profitable vnto young men, if they woulde consider these hor∣rible examples in histories. For it is certayne in the whole lawe there are added promises of rewards, which are bestowed vpon the obedient, as is to be séene in <HI>Tobia</HI> which was blessed of his father, in Iesu the sonne of Mary which was subiect to his Parentes, and obeyed them euen to the death. And in Iohn and others innumera∣ble of godly children. And there are also added vnto the law threat∣nings of plagues and punishmentes, which the stubborne, wicked and disobedient children shal féele, that haue contemptuously diso∣beyed their Parents. For it is written: Al collusion, disobedience and rebellion, receiueth iust recompence of such hurte and dam∣mage, which thing at this day, manie young men haue assayed and prooued to their greate shame and confusion: which haue contemned the obedience of Parents. Euen as it happened vn∣to <HI>Esau,</HI> which vered his Parentes in marrying vngodly wiues, which intreated their Father and mother in lawe very contumeli∣ously despitefully and contemptuously: And he himselfe also taketh vpon him in his fathers house to commaund most malapertly and proudly, and expulsed his brother Iacob, for whom he lay in waite to haue murdered and slayne: neyther doth he feare punishment nor regardeth the threatnings of God, but contemneth his fathers admonitions, and therefore he is accursed.</P>
<P>But on the contrary part Iacob both reuerenceth his parents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iacob.</NOTE>
<PB REF="71"/>
and loueth his brother: for he feareth the iudgement of God, &amp; pu∣nishment that might therof ensue. And agayne also he knew &amp; cōsi∣dered y<SUP>•</SUP> rewards which were promised for well doyng, therfore he doeth his duetie, that hee might call vpon God with a good consci∣ence. Furthermore also he acknowledgeth that God hath care and regarde vnto corporall blessinges, and therefore prayeth vnto GOD and desireth that he might bée defended and ayded against his brother, after this manner doth he exercise his faith and inuo∣cation, whiles hée studieth by all meanes possible to comfort and appease the sorrowes and griefes of his Parentes, &amp; at the last gi∣ueth place to his brother: Therfore he enioyeth great rewardes at Gods hand, he is instructed and defended in a woonderfull manner, preserued &amp; enriched amongst his very enimies, that being olde, he saw his sonnne Ioseph in floorishing &amp; most prosperous state, which to him was no little ioy and comfort. Let children weigh and con∣sider these and such like examples, and let them learne vndoubted∣ly y<SUP>•</SUP> God hath great care of them, &amp; that he will bestow vpon them many corporall blessinges for performing their dueties towardes their Parents, Magistrates, Maisters, &amp; Teachers: Let them also consider and call to their remembraunce what greate paynes and cares Parentes haue had in their education, and what true loue they beare towardes them, and what greate benefites shall redounde vnto them by their godlie education and instruction. For these and such like blessinges, let them acknowledge them∣selues to bée thankfull. And let them knowe that GOD doeth punishe the vnthankefull as sayeth Solomon: <HI>Non recedet ma∣lum à domo ingrati. <HI>Plagues and punishmentes shall not departe from the house of an vnthankfull person.</HI></HI> Also let all godly Children<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph.</NOTE> and young men studie to followe the Patriarche Ioseph, and by his example learne to honour their Parentes: Who when hee was solde into Egypt, and afterwarde by Gods prouidence pro∣moted to great honour, and high authoritie, so that hee was the very next vnto the king, how did hee prouide for his father Iacob, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding for him very honorably to come to him into Egypt, where he had great entertainment of the king and enioyed the pleasures and blessings of the lande, afterwards when hée was dead, with what great pompe &amp; renome did he carrie him foorth thence into the land of <HI>Chanaan,</HI> there to bée buried with the Fathers the Patriarkes:

<P>But to contemne them, is surely a most pestilent thing, and ex∣treame madnesse.

A disobedient sonne (saieth a cer∣taine man) is a cruell murtherer of his Parentes, for that there is no sorow or griefe in the whole course and life of men greater, than that which ariseth of the calamitie and wickednes of children, such as was of our first Parentes or of <HI>Dauid,</HI> Let children consider of these thinges, that it may increase in them a greater and more di∣ligent care of obeying than heretofore.</P>

A lyke example is also recised of <HI>Vale∣rius</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Valerius <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</NOTE> <HI>maximus,</HI> in this wise: The <HI>Pretor</HI> sitting in iudgement, deli∣uered vnto one of the <HI>Triumuir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a noble woman condemned to death to be executed in the prison. And when hée had sent her vn∣to the kéeper of the prison, hée being moued with pitie and compas∣sion towardes the woman, did not foorth with execute her, but per∣mitted her daughter to haue accesse vnto her mother, hauing great regard (as hée thought) that hée should bring nothing vnto her for her nourishment and preseruation, that might prolong her life, sup∣posing that so within a litle while shée should famish &amp; pine away. And when many dayes were nowe past ouer, and the woman yet<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the daugh∣ter that nouri∣shed her mo∣ther in prison.</NOTE> liuing, hée musing with himselfe what should be the cause, that shée was susteined so long, watched her daughter now more narrowly than before, at the last hée espied the daughter giuing her mother sucke of her full breasts, which shée had prepared for the same pur∣pose, alwayes against her comming thither, which so rare &amp; won∣derfull a spectacle when hée beheld, hée coulde not choose but make the <HI>Triumuir</HI> priuie thereof, and hée went and shewed the <HI>Pretor,</HI> and the <HI>Pretor</HI> opened the matter vnto the Consuls, who graunted vnto the woman remission and pardon for her fact before commit∣ted, and highly commended her for nurturing and bringing vp so naturall and louing a daughter.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="75"/>And to the ende that children might bée the more excited and moued to the loue of their parents, I will shewe you another rare example. There is in the region and countrie of <HI>Scicilia</HI> the moun∣taine <HI>Aethna</HI> of an vnmeasurable bignesse, which burning with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aethna.</NOTE> continuall fire, casteth out such fiery flambes, and bloweth out such burning stones, with such violence and forcible maner, by means whereof the neighbours there aboutes bordering, susteine no litle losse, hinderance, and perill. It chaunced therefore (in the 3510. yéere of the foundation of the worlde, after the <HI>Babilonicall</HI> deliue∣rance) that this Mountaine threw foorth such forcible and mighty fiers, that the Citie <HI>Cathana</HI> was burnt and consumed to dust, as witnesseth <HI>Pansania,</HI> saying: <HI>Et, arderent aruis segetes, &amp; milliacul∣tuiugera cum dominis, syluae colles{que} virtutes. Adëo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t quis{que} quod sibi charissimum esset, conaretur ex incendio asportare, &amp;c. <HI>The corne fields a thousande acrees with their furniture, together with the owners, the greene woods, vallies, and hilles were quite consumed and burnt to dust. So that whatsoeuer any man had, that hee esteemed, hee did his best to conueigh and carry it out of this dreadfull and raging fire.</HI></HI> There were dwelling in the same Citie two brethren (to wit) <HI>Philonius</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An example o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Philonius &amp; Callias.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Callias,</HI> which leauing golde, siluer, precious stones, and all o∣ther Iewels whatsoeuer: tooke vp their Parents vpon their shoul∣ders (being now aged, and there withall so weake and féeble, and therefore not able to helpe them selues) deliuered them from the rage of that furious Fire, to the great admiration of the behol∣ders.</P>
<P>Thus were they deliuered, euen as the people of Israel in the red Sea, or the thrée brethren in the hot burning Ouen, whom <HI>Da∣niel</HI> spake of at large, to the great prayse of Almightie God. And if these naturall affections of the <HI>Ethnickes</HI> and Heathen men▪ which do these things without faith, and the true knowledge of God, are to bée liked and allowed, how much more of Christians, which are baptized in the name of Iesus Christe?</P>
<P>A like thing happened of one <HI>Cymon</HI> an <HI>Athenian,</HI> whose loue and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cymon.</NOTE> pietie towards his Parents was so excéeding great, that the Lord God rewarded him wonderfully for the same (that is to say) with prosperitie and long life. For when his father <HI>Miltiades</HI> for the mo∣ney which hée had borowed out of the common treasury, was cast into prison, there to suffer famishment except he could pay the debt
<PB REF="76"/>
and hée nowe almost pined and withered away. <HI>Cymon</HI> to the end that hée might nowe deliuer and redéeme his father, besought the Magistrates, that hée might bée kept in prison in the stéed of his fa∣ther, vntill hée coulde pay those thirtie thousand crownes into the treasurie (for so much hée ought). <HI>Cymon</HI> was receiued into prison, the father was set at libertie, who not long after died, héere (to mans iudgement) <HI>Cymon</HI> was like to perish for the loue he bare to his father. At the last a certaine famous and worthie Citizen be∣ing very rich tooke to wife the daughter of this <HI>Miltiades,</HI> who payd the money that was due for <HI>Cymon</HI> his brother in law, and so deli∣uered him out of that calamitie, perill, and misery. There is no doubt but that it was Gods prouidence, that <HI>Cymon</HI> shoulde bee deliuered. For by this example, God would shewe himselfe ac∣cording to his promise, to render vnto obedient and louing childrē the rewardes of their godlinesse, albeit they be strangers from the Christian faith.</P>

<P>I thinke you doubt not of this point, yet for the goodwil I beare to Amusus and his children, I will declare &amp; open vnto you what∣soeuer may séeme to apperteine to this purpose, if so bée now I can call to my remembrance, those things which héeretofore I haue read in good authours concerning this matter. Although Pa∣rents<NOTE PLACE="marg">The persons of pa are not to be respected but the will of God is to be conside∣red.</NOTE> bee neuer so poore, base, simple, féeble, &amp;c. They ought not for any of these causes to bée destitute and spoyled of the honor gi∣uen them of God: for they ought not to behold their person (to wit) what maner men they hée: but héere the will of God only is to bée obserued and regarded, which hath willed and commaunded it so, which also to this his commaundement, hath added a promise, farre more excellent then all the riches in this worlde: For who so doe truely and vnfeignedly honour their parents, there are pro∣mised vnto them of God in this world, long life, peace, health, and happy, and prosperous successe in all thinges. But contrariwise, who so resist the diuine worde of God, an vnhappie life, and that very short, is ready to fall vpon them by and by, because they haue disobeyed the Lord of life. For these stubborne &amp; rebellious wret∣ches, are vtterly forsaken of God, and so become théeues, robbers, and murtherers, to their owne shame &amp; confusion. For with great disdaine and hatred they contemne the good and godly instructions of Parents, and wil not suffer any correction or chastisement, and so it often chaunceth that these varlots come very seldome vnto mature and rype age, but are cut of before their time. Neyther be they so happy, as that they fall into the handes of the hangman, whereby they may haue time to repent them of their former liues, but being ouercome with drunkennesse and ryot, behaue them∣selues

in such ruffianlie maner, that in their desperate frayes, they dye of the sworde, or by some other misfortune, are slaine, or els by fier or water doe miserably perish.

Let them also kéepe in memory the horrible ex∣ample of <HI>Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiron,</HI> which for resisting the Magistrates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 16.</NOTE> were swallowed vp quicke &amp; throwne into Hell. The wayward∣nesse &amp; wrabbednesse of parents, doth not discharge the fift cōman∣dement, as witnesseth S. Peter, saying: <HI>Non solum bonis, sed ettam discolis obedite, <HI>Obey not only your good and wise parents, but also your wayward &amp; foolish parents.</HI></HI> As also the Prophet <HI>Baruch</HI> saith. 2. <HI>Vult Iudaeos malis &amp; imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is obedire. <HI>God would haue the Iewes to obey their wicked &amp; vngodly parents,</HI></HI> as hath bin said before. <HI>Moses</HI> doth not say honor yée, your good, wise, &amp; rich parents, but speaketh simply with∣out any distinction or difference: <HI>Honora parentes. <HI>Honor thy parents.</HI></HI> But when God at any time sendeth wrabbed, wayward, and hard hearted parents, this chaunceth for our sinns &amp; wickednes: For it maketh no matter to vs, whether they bée worthie or vnworthie, noble or base, rich or poore: for what maner parents soeuer they bée yet not without the great prouidence of God they are our parents. But who so thinketh that decript &amp; doting parents are not to be ho¦nored and reuerenced. Let them heare now a notable example and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An example worthy to be re∣membred of an olde man.</NOTE> worthie to bee remembred, of a certaine housholder, which had an olde father decript and bowed together with age, and therewithall doting and very childish againe, so that when the meates &amp; things were set vpon the table, he would by and by ouerthrow the dishes and pottes, &amp; powre out the pottage vpon the table, to the great an∣noyance of the guests many times: but whē this had chanced thus very often, y<SUP>e</SUP> housekéeper his sonne begā to disdain therat, &amp; to take y<SUP>e</SUP> matter gréeuously, &amp; studied which way he might find a remedy, for this trouble, &amp; at the last he deuised a trough or hollow thing to be made of wood, whereout he might eate his meat: And whiles the thing was in making &amp; preparing, the young sonne of this houshol∣der,

began to reason with his father, &amp; demaunded of him to what vse that shoulde serue (for hée knewe very well his father had no Swine to féede therein): his father answered: that hée had made it for his graundfather, that hencefoorth he may dine and suppe out of the same: Then the litle child asked his father againe, saying after this maner. My good father, when you shalbe as old as my grand∣father, shall I be compelled to make such a hogges trough for you also? which wordes so soone as his father heard, he was excéedingly astonished, and began to sigh meruellously, and straight way with great sorrow of mind, hee threw from him the trough very dis∣dainfully, and began to bethinke with himselfe what that childishe question should meane, &amp; rightly wayed and considered with him∣self vnto how many great miseries and calamities mans life was subiect insomuch as after that, he euer gaue great honor &amp; reuerēce vnto his old father, and neuer was offended after that, with the mad &amp; doting pranckes of his father so long as hée liued.</P>

<P>The chiefest care of children toward their parents is this, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the dutie of children to∣wardes their parentes.</NOTE> before all things they studie to loue them intirely: for as witnes∣seth <HI>Plinie <HI>Amor optimus discendi magister.</HI> Loue is the best maister to learne any thing.</HI> For euery doctrine and teaching is much more easie translated and conneighed into the minde of the childe, if hée loue his father: wherefore I iudge and thinke it conuenient that children are to bée admonished, that they loue their parents no lesse then their godly disciplines, doctrines and chidings. For suche godlinesse and pietie of children auaileth greatly to this purpose, they will heare more willingly, and giue credite to their wordes, and will couet and desire to bée like them, they will not take it in ill part to be corrected, but they will reioyce to bée praysed, &amp; they wyll acknowledge that it is their fathers dutie to teach, and theirs to shew themselues willing to be taught.

to bée too heard or vngentle vnto them, yet shall they beare it with a lowly and willing mind.

If they shall fall into any gréeuous sicknes, pouer∣tie, or extreeme olde age, it shalbe the childrens duetie willingly to relieue and comfort them by all possible meanes. To bee briefe, if all things chaunce w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ily vnto them, the children shall reioyce with all their heartes: Againe, if they shall sée them vnfor∣tunate, then shall the children forrow no lesse, then if it were their owne case, and they ought to bée mooued with as great pitty and compassion, as though this sicknesse, griefe, paine, or punishment, did apperteine only to them.</P>

<P>Seeing that by many and diuers examples, and also daily experience it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the affec∣tions of chil∣dren are more colde towards their Parents, than of the Pa∣rentes towards their children.</NOTE> selfe can teach vs, that all Parents (by a certaine guiding of nature) do tru∣ly and with all their heartes loue their children (which natural effect also appeareth in the wilde and sauage beastes.) Howe commeth this to passe, that the children doe not loue their Parents againe, neither reuerence nor obey them, to whom neuerthelesse they are bounde for all thinges which they haue receiued, yea the life it selfe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that I perceiue in al families y<SUP>•</SUP> natural affectiōs &amp; loue of chil∣dren<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first cause of disobedience.</NOTE> towards their parents, for the most part are more cold, weak, &amp; faint, this happeneth of two causes chiefly. First, the dispositions and inclinations of children are so corrupted with the faultes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>innes of our old &amp; great Graundfather <HI>Adam,</HI> that they more fer∣uently desire to be beloued than their parents. Secondly, as y<SUP>e</SUP> Phi∣losophers do iudge, the parents are in the ascendent degrée: but the children in the descendent degrée, and so falleth out their loue. Euen as a stone falleth more easily downwards than vpwards. Where∣fore most true is that common saying: One father with a lesse care and more chearfull minde can nourish and bring vp ten children, than ten children can comfort and cherish one father: hereof it may easily be iudged, how great the loue and readie good will of children is to helpe their parents in their necessities. Therfore they do very foolishly, which being poore and well striken in yeares, doe looke for great aide &amp; succour frō their children: wherefore if they couet &amp; de∣sire to take good counsel for thēselues, they shal rather earnestly en∣deuour to settle &amp; repose al their whole cōfidence &amp; trust in y<SUP>•</SUP> which is the fountaine of all paternitie &amp; goodnes. But yet more foolishly and vnaduisedly do they which through too fond affection &amp; loue be∣ing yet aliue, do yéeld &amp; deliuer vp into the hands of their children, their goods, coyne, &amp; all their inheritance, wholly persuading them selues to liue more easily of the beneuolence &amp; loue of their children,
<PB REF="82"/>
whom oftentimes they finde very foolish, negligent and carelesse, to their great losse, hindrance, and vtter vndoing, with their intolle∣rable sorrow and griefe all the dayes of their liues. When neuer∣theles <HI>Eccle. 33.</HI> setteth foorth vnto these olde men most wholesome counsell. <HI>Filio, inquit Iesus Syrach &amp; mulieri, fratri aut amico, non des potestatē super te in vita tua, non dederis alij possessionē tuā, ne for∣tè poeniteat te, &amp; depreceris pro illis. Dū adhuc superes &amp; aspiras non immutabit te omnis caro. <HI>Saith Iesus Syrach, giue not thy sonne, thy wife, thy brother, nor thy friend, power ouer thee while thou liuest: &amp; giue not away thy goods &amp; possession to another, lest it repent thee, and thou beest faine to beg therfore thy self. As long as thou liuest and hast breath let no man chaunge thee:</HI> Melius est enim vt filij tui te rogent, quàm te respi∣cere in manus filiorum tuorum. <HI>For better it is thy children to pray and intreat thee, than that thou shouldest be faine to looke into their handes saieth</HI> Syrach.</HI> Yet it is not the wil of God, y<SUP>•</SUP> they should depart this life altogether without y<SUP>e</SUP> making &amp; preparing of their last wil and Testament. But he would haue vs willing &amp; readie to dispose our goods, lands &amp; possessions before our death, saying after this maner: <HI>In consummatione dierū vitae tuae, &amp; in tēpore exitus tui distribue h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣reditatē tuam. <HI>At the time when thou shalt end thy dayes, &amp; finishe thy life, distribute thine inheritance, possession and goods.</HI></HI></P>

<P>How commeth it to passe, that at this day, there is almost no dutie per∣formed vnto Magistrates &amp; Elders, nor any reuerence or regard vnto Pa∣rents?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes verely. For another cause why children doo not obey &amp; honor<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seconde cause why chil∣dren are so diso∣bedient.</NOTE> their parents at this day, is y<SUP>•</SUP> filthy slothfulnes of parēts, &amp; the neg∣ligence, &amp; too much carelesnes, nothing beséeming without dout, or méet for Christians: For howe shall a childe kéepe &amp; performe the precepts of the second table, which is ignorant of the precepts of the first table? out of y<SUP>•</SUP> which as out of a fountaine issueth &amp; procéedeth the dutie of parents &amp; Magistrates, &amp;c. And all other works of loue &amp; obedience. It were therfore to be wished, nay rather to be perfor∣med, that children &amp; subiects ought diligētly to be instructed in the first preceptes, to y<SUP>e</SUP> end they might learn to know God, to trust in him, to loue, feare, and worship him, to call vpon him, to giue him
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
thankes, to honor his holy name, &amp; willingly to heare &amp; learne his word: these &amp; such like if they were truely obserued, then without doubt the good fruites of obedience should by &amp; by follow, wherfore in these things the greatest care and diligence must be vsed.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding albeit it is euidēt that youth is depraued &amp; corrupted partly with the fault of our corrupt nature, &amp; partly made worse through the negligēce &amp; too much cockering of parents: shal they not be vrged &amp; pricked forward with stripes, &amp; admonished and stirred vp with examples &amp; reasons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The loue &amp; reuerēce of young men towards their parents shal by no meanes neither more easily nor more aptly bee prouoked &amp; stir∣red vp thē if they acknowledge their parēts to be the original cause of their birth, if they acknowledge them to bée the shop of their life, &amp; to be briefe, the men, by whom we begin to be men: also we shall indeuour to honor &amp; reuerence them with al our harts, if we weigh with our selues the greate and manifold charges, the gréeuous sor∣rowes, and cares which they haue byn compelled to suffer for our sakes, for they haue oftē spared frō their own bellies, to féede ours, brokē many sléepes to quiet &amp; pleasure vs, afflicted with many grée∣uous cares, and wéeried with labours, to the ende that they might prouide &amp; get those things y<SUP>•</SUP> might doe vs good &amp; are necessary to the furtherance of our life, Besides this with their admonitions they haue procured vnto vs the true catholike faith in God, and also the hope &amp; loue of euerlasting saluatiō, y<SUP>•</SUP> after this life ended, we might liue with God for euer: whē we vnderstād y<SUP>•</SUP> these so great benefits are giuē vnto vs of our parēts, how shal we not loue them? &amp; reue∣rēce thē with al our hearts at al times &amp; in al places? this saying of <HI>Philo</HI> shal also stirre vp &amp; moue children very much vnto the reue∣rence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo.</NOTE> of their parents, which saith: <HI>Quod Deus est mundo, hoc liberis Parentes esse arbitror: <HI>Looke what God is vnto the worlde, I iudge Pa∣rents to be the same thing to their children:</HI></HI> For as God made y<SUP>•</SUP> that was not, to the ende it might appeare: So they imitating his pow∣er as much as possible might be, doe make an immortall generatiō<NOTE PLACE="marg">Only the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. commaunde∣ment hath a promise.</NOTE> and linage by their progenies. Also it shal not a litle stirre vp the mindes of godly children to the loue of their Parentes if they shall rightly weigh and consider that neuer one of the commandements hath any singuler promise, but only the 5. commandement. For by the name of long life is not only vnderstood the cōtinuance of daies,
<PB REF="83"/>
but also the tranquillitie and quietnesse of this corporall life. But heere I am more full of wordes then the matter doth require: For séeing that youth doe now vnderstand y<SUP>•</SUP> they receiue so great bene∣fites frō their elders, surely except they haue hearts more hard then the Adamant, they woulde bee inflamed and incited by their owne accord vnto the honor and loue of their Parents, &amp; should neede no spurres nor such prouocations and allurementes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theophilus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true my good <HI>Theodidactus.</HI> For it were the partes of wise &amp; godly childrē willingly to be drawne to the obedience of their parēts. But what more special things are there to be deuised for children, which might more gladly &amp; with greater affection moue them to the obedience of their Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the better performing of this honor to their parents, childrē ought most specially to remember (except they be altogether harde<NOTE PLACE="marg">What thinges do chiefly stirre vp children to the honor and obedience of Parentes.</NOTE> hearted &amp; vnnatural) y<SUP>•</SUP> perils dolors &amp; anguishes which their mo∣thers sustained &amp; suffered for thē in their trauaile &amp; birth: &amp; therw<SUP>t</SUP>∣al let thē diligētly cōsider with what greate paines, cares, frightes, sorrowes &amp; charges frō their infancy vpwards, they are brought vp of their parents, which thing they may more easily collect &amp; gather by the education and bringing vp of other children and infantes. In like maner they ought to remember and ponder this one thing wel, that their children shalbe such to them when they are parents, as they now shew themselues towards their parents. But this as<NOTE PLACE="marg">To honor Pa∣rents is the most accepta∣ble worship to God.</NOTE> yet is but a small thing, for they ought diligently to consider that to honour their Parentes is the most acceptable woorship to God that can bee, &amp; that what dueties soeuer thou shalt performe to thy parents, the same God iudgeth &amp; estemeth as done vnto himself the which also he wil recōpence, with many &amp; great benefits: whē on y<SUP>•</SUP> cōtrary part (as is aforesaid) he wil punish the impietie of children towards their Parents, with grieuous maledictions, plagues, and tormentes. There is a very profitable lesson concerning these thinges in <HI>Eccle. 3.</HI> Which because it is somewhat touched before I will here omit. Moreouer children ought to set before their eyes, the example of Iesus Christ the sonne of the liuing God who albeit he was the liuely image of his father, became neuerthelesse obedi∣ent vnto his father euen to the death of the Crosse. But if children when they bée adopted into Sonnes of GOD for Christ his sake,
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
doe desire to be made fellow heires of Christ in heauen: surely then very duety requireth, that they also follow the exāple of Christ his obedience in earth according to their seueral callings. For there bée among the very bruite beasts, which when their Parents are well striken in yéeres, do by course and turne requite them againe with foode &amp; nourishment. Therfore what great dishonestie, filthinesse, detestation and villanie is it, if he which bosteth &amp; vanteth himself, that he is not only a man indued with reason: but also beléeueth y<SUP>•</SUP> he is the adopted sonne of God, bee ouercome of the bruite beastes with gratitude &amp; kindnes towards their parents? Godly children ought to study, find out &amp; practise these &amp; such like examples, that at the last willingly &amp; by their owne minds they might be excited and drawne to the due obedience of their Parentes.</P>

Second∣ly it followeth, that this commaundement is necessary that there
<PB REF="84"/>
might be a true worship of God, in the which youth might exercise themselues▪ vnto true pietie and godlines. Thirdly it is profitable for the rewards that therein is promised. Fourthly, those doe wel and rightly, which kéepe the same. Fiftly wée are bounde to the kéeping of the same vnder payne of damnation. But that I may be more briefe &amp; at the last make an end of these things, the minds of children shalbe wonderfully stirred vp to honor their parents, if they rightly weigh with themselues, what <HI>Moses</HI> meaneth when he saith: Honor thy father &amp; mother▪ for although their parents be mē, yet doth not <HI>Moses</HI> say, honor thē, as they are mē, but honor thy fa∣ther &amp; mother, as though he shoulde say, honor thē whō▪ God fauou∣reth, which God hath coupled together, and which are exercised in y<SUP>•</SUP> kind of life y<SUP>•</SUP> pleaseth almighty God, In like manner he doth not say, honor thy God or thine euil father or mother, or thine hard har∣ted, gētle, wayward, rich, or poore parents: but he saith, honor thy fa¦ther &amp; thy mother, without adding any <HI>Epithite,</HI> cōdition or quality. Therefore let children &amp; young men learne to reuerence and obey their parents, &amp; to hold these vocables &amp; titles, (father &amp; mother) in great price &amp; for most sacred reliques. And let them rather wishe to die, then willingly &amp; obstinately to offende them: for parents haue nothing in this life, wherein they are more affected and delighted, then in the loue of their children, and therfore most easily offended, when they doe any thing contrary to their liking.</P>

<P>I maruel nothing more (<HI>O Theodi.</HI>) thē why parents are moued with so great loue &amp; delight in their childrē, wheras they oftētimes on the cōtrary part, proue very vnkind, wicked &amp; vnnatural towards their parentes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>There be many causes why parēts are so affected towards their childrē, but y<SUP>•</SUP> first &amp; chiefest cause of al is god, which hath created, &amp; put into the mindes of parentes such a most perfect &amp; true natural affectiō towards their children, y<SUP>•</SUP> if at any time their minds be hurt strickē &amp; wounded w<SUP>t</SUP> sorrow &amp; heauines of heart for y<SUP>•</SUP> calamitie of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellious chil∣dren doe stay their parents very often, not with sword, but with sorowe and heauinesse of heart.</NOTE> their childrē, y<SUP>•</SUP> same is a most presēt▪ plague &amp; poysō to their liues: so y<SUP>•</SUP> they are easily s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aine &amp; murdred albeit not w<SUP>t</SUP> sword or other wea∣pō, yet with lamentation, wéeping, wailing, inward sorrow griefe and heauines of hearte.

<P>Wherefore such as are conuersant among the wise and learned can easily iudge, how profitable and also how necessary the know∣ledge of tongues is, and the perfect instruction of good artes.

earnestly (in my iudgement) they are to be moued vnto vertue and godlines: For what shall it profite to haue the knowledge of many artes and sciences, if the loue of vertue and true godlinesse shall bée wanting. <HI>Socrates</HI> was wont to persuade young men, that they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates.</NOTE> shoulde behold themselues often in a looking glasse, and if they sée∣med beautiful &amp; well fauoured, y<SUP>•</SUP> thē they shall beware, least they shoulde commit any thing not beséeming their beautie: if not, looke what lacked in the comelinesse and fauour of their face and bodies, they should recompence the same, with the towardnesse of wit, and comelinesse of maners. Thus did this excellent man take occasion in euery place, to exhort men to the studie and loue of ver∣tue.

<P>There is nothing truer without doubt.

And when this delicate Dame did offer and promise vn∣to him, that if hée would choose her wayes, hée shoulde haue with her, mirth, ioy, wealth and the abundance of all worldly pleasures: But the other could assure him of nothing but hunger, thirst, heat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The example of <HI>Hercules.</HI></NOTE> colde, and whatsoeuer sadnesse, heauinesse, hardnesse and horrour might bée deuised, but the end and rewarde of these thinges, shall be at the last, the inioying of the euerlasting felicitie in heauen, with the sight of the Godhead, and felowship of the Angels and Saints. He taking the more excellent and wholsome counsell, chose rather
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
to follow the way of vertue, albeit for the present time more hard, daungerous and odible: But surely there are very few that will follow <HI>Hercules</HI> in this point.</P>
<P>Moreouer, what the Poets doe declare of <HI>Hercules,</HI> that doeth the holy Scripture truely testifie to haue chaunced vnto <HI>Moses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The example of <HI>Moyses.</HI></NOTE> which as S. Paul saith <HI>11.

A good and faithfull father of fami∣ly, and maister of houshold, ought alwaies to propone and set foorth such examples as these, vnto his children and seruants, that at the last hée may reduce and bring them into the way of vertue: but the youth which cannot bee moued by these and such like examples, are very dull, blockish, and must needes bée enstraunged from all vertue and godlinesse.</P>

<P>As the studies of good Artes, and vertue are so nigh kinne, and so wel agreeing betweene themselues, that the one cannot, neither ought to bee without the other: So I iudge this third thing (to wit) the studie of wise∣dome meete to bee added vnto them, without the which those two are but as dumbe images, or rather of things hauing no life.

But shée that will prooue a good wife, is for the most parte indued with these thrée vertues: shée will honor, esteeme and obey both fa∣ther and mother with great reuerence and lowlinesse of mind, she wil loue, cherish, and make much of infants, shée can sing wel and swéetely.</P>
<P><HI>Philelphus</HI> saith: When a man goeth about to woe his wife. Let<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philelphus.</NOTE> him first very warily and diligently séeke to vnderstande of the life fame, and good report of her mother, and of such fréendes, as haue had the education and trayning vp of her, with whom hée purpo∣seth to marry: And if all things fall out and bée answerable to his desire, then in Gods name let him not feare to take to wife the daughter of an honest and godly mother: Nor let him marry her<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of ma∣riage.</NOTE> only for necessitie sake, but for the cause of a more commodious &amp; ioyfull life to come, with whō an acceptable societie of life must now begin▪ not for the fulfilling of lust, but for the propagation and increase of children. And <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith: Let him marry a maid, to the end hée may teach her good maners, and such other dueties, as are most beséeming and decent for a wife, for shée wil also be more tractable then a widdow, whe rather will looke to bee obeied, aswel for that shée hath béen before acquainted with loue matters, as also bicause for the most part they bring greater wealth vnto their hus∣bands▪ then the maides doe.</P>
<P>And if you woulde now demaunde of mée what maner of wife is<NOTE PLACE="marg">What mauner Wife is to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e maried.</NOTE> to bée married, I say it is very méete and conuenient, that you matche not your sonnes with such wiues as bée more Noble, and of greater birth or richer than they, But rather followe that olde and wise Prouerbe: <HI>Equalem tibi mulierem inquire. <HI>Search out a wo∣man that is thine equall.</HI></HI> And as the Poet saith: <HI>Si vis nubere, nube pa∣ri. <HI>If thou wilt needes marry, then marry thy matche.</HI></HI> For who so matcheth withfarre richer wiues then themselues, they seldom
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
acknowledge them for their husbands, but rather account them as bondmen of their dowrie. And <HI>Menander</HI> saith: <HI>Vxorem ducito ex aequalibus, ne si ex ditioribus duxeris, dominos tibi pares, non affines, imo fugiendae sunt pecuniosae vxores: quia pecuniosa vxor, non est vxor sed verius imperiosa domina. <HI>Marry thou a wife from among thy fami∣lier mates, least if thou shalt marry one of the richer sort, thou gettest lordes and maisters ouer thee, in steede of kinsmen: nay rather these rich monied wiues are to bee shunned: for such as doe bring with them their stuffed bagges with these red ruddockes, proue very seldome louing and o∣bedient wiues, but rather stately, Lady like and imperious dames.</HI></HI></P>

<P>I pray you sir, tell me yet this one thing: Is it not good to marry a faire wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>All young men for the most part couet to marry faire<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theophra∣stus.</NOTE> wiues: But <HI>Theophrastus</HI> is of this minde, that a man may vse and inioy a harde fauoured and browne woman, with lesse griefe and sorrowe, then hée may preserue and kéepe his faire and well fauoured wife, for hée accounteth nothing certaine and sure vnto any man, whereon both the eyes and feruent desires of all people are wholy bent and firmely fixed. For as muche as, one with fauour and comelinesse, will séeke to solicite her, another with his fine wit and painted eloquence will moue and prouoke her, some with delicate daliance mixed with mery conceipts, wil séeke to al∣lure her, and others with liberall giftes will not sticke to intic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her: <HI>Nam pecuniae obedunt omnia. <HI>For all thinges obey to money.</HI></HI> And the fort or Castle (bée it neuer so strong) by one meane or other must néedes bée ouercome and vanquished, which one euery parte is so besieged and assaulted. The Poet <HI>Ennius,</HI> perswadeth vs to marry such, as are of pure and perfect chastitie, &amp; of comely stature, (though somewhat browne▪) which also <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI> de∣clareth and affirmeth, saying: <HI>Eas stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> formae esse, quae nec formosissima nec turpissima forma sunt, sed mediocritatem quan∣dam habent, quae quidem mediocritas omnibus in rebus laudatissi∣ma est. <HI>Those women are accounted well fauoured and comely, which</HI></HI>
<PB REF="103"/>
<HI>are neither the fairest, nor yet the foulest or harde fauoured, but haue a cer∣taine meane</HI> (as wée commonly vse to say, shee is neither faire nor foule, but browne louely:) <HI>which mediocritie in all things verily, is to bee commeded and praised.</HI> And this comely stature (out of doubt) is sufficient and best agreing for the procreation of children. For comelinesse and séemly proportion in women auaileth very much, euen as in the men a good countenance, a comely stature, with wisdome and discretion is to bée wished, and moste acceptable vnto a woman. Therfore in a wife, not beautie and finenesse: but vertue and godlinesse is to bée respected, as <HI>Michael Verinus</HI> saith ve∣ry properly in these verses:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Sit form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa aliis, vxor tibi si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bona, nescis,</HI></L>
<L><HI>quàm noceat castae forma pudicitiae.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Egrè formosam poteris seruare puellam:</HI></L>
<L><HI>nuuc prece, nunc aura, forma petitaruit.</HI></L>
<L>The faire and beautifull let be, to other wights (I say▪)</L>
<L>the vertuous and the modest maide get thou (if that thou may.)</L>
<L>For beautie hindereth chastitie, (of this thou maiest bee sure)</L>
<L>the maide that beautie doeth possesse, chaste hardly shall indure.</L>
<L>For some with wordes will her assault, and sleights of <HI>Venus</HI> vse,</L>
<L>and some with gold will her allure, which scarsce she will refuse.</L>
</LG>
<P>These and many other thinges are to bée wayed and considered in the choyse of a wife, and chiefly this, that thou chosest one like to thy selfe in religion, stocke wealth and comelinesse: for the vn∣likenesse of these things: is oftentimes the occasions of contempt and continuall brawling and chiding.</P>
<P>For <HI>Cicero</HI> in his first booke of Offices saith: <HI>Nihil amabilius, nec</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cecero.</NOTE> <HI>copulatius, quàm morum similitudo bonorum, <HI>There is nothing that win∣neth more loue, nor surelier knitteth men together, then a likenesse in good conditions,</HI></HI> For in whom bée like desires, and like mindes it happeneth among them, that either with other is as much deli∣ted, as with himselfe: And so is it brought to passe that <HI>Pithagoras</HI> requires in amitie▪ <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vnus fiat ex pluribus. <HI>That many may be∣come</HI></HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pithagoras.</NOTE> <HI>one.</HI> Also it is good for a man to marry a maide, and suche a one, as before hath béene married to no man. For who so taketh a Widdowe to wife, tyeth hym selfe chiefly
<PB N="99" REF="103"/>
vnto two great troubles, first hée must deuise and labour by all meanes possible, to make her forget the manners and qualities of her first husbande: secondly, hée must acquaint her verie warely with his owne nature and qualities, and make her to haue a good opinion &amp; liking of himselfe, and of his maners, both which hee shal hardly doe, without great pollicie and discretion.</P>

<P>You haue nowe declared vnto vs the chiefe pointes concerning Matri∣mony it selfe: Nowe it is needful that you shew vnto vs whether the pri∣uie contractes and espousalles made without the consent of Parentes and gouernours, ought to be accounted lawful before God and men, or not? And whether such knottes, affiances, and betrothinges may bee broken, which are done without the good wil and consent of Parentes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before all thinges, young men must séeke to shunne &amp; abhorre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We ought not to marry with∣out the consent of our Parents, &amp; dear friends.</NOTE> this detestable sinne of disobedience (the which alas at this day is too common) lest they intangle them selues vnto marriage with∣out the consent of their Parentes: for this is not only great diso∣bedience, but rather verie great madnesse. For what is more grieffull and more miserable, than a marriage enterprised and be∣gunne so wickedly, or a knot so vnluckely knit, that it cannot bée vnlosed againe all the dayes of our life? wherein wée shall conti∣nually be exercised in sorrowe, vnquietnesse, and brawling, detay∣ned in miserie, misfortune and calamitie, out of the which wee can neuer wynde our selues, nor be deliuered, excepte it be by death. Truely youth must néedes fall into great perilles and daungers, when neglecting and contemning the authoritie of their Parents, they aspire and studie by all meanes possible to attaine vnto mar∣riage, making them priuie nothing at all, vntill the matter be past remedie, and so begin their wedlocke in sin and disobedience, which God will neuer blesse nor prosper: But contrariwise, if they will endeuour to kéepe the commaundementes of Almightie God, and to honour and obey their Parentes, then hée hath promised to loue them, and will bestowe his bountifull liberalitie and blessings vp∣on them. In the meane time, Parents ought not to neglect their dueties in bestowing and matching of their children, for when the time serueth, and the occasion is offered of God, to bestowe their sonnes or daughters vnto matrimony, then shal they not doubtful∣ly
<PB REF="104"/>
dispute and reason about the dowrie, stocke, or Parentage, and to séeke a knot in a rush (as they say) or to detract and prolong the time without iust cause, but the will of God must alwayes be re∣spected and obeyed, and the honour, health, estimation, and credit of the persons must be rightly weighed and considered.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> in the historie that hée writeth of <HI>Rebecca,</HI> saieth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrose.</NOTE> that it is néedfull, requisite, and verie necessarie to haue the consent of the Parents in matters of marriage, &amp; he saith further, that it is an honest, godly, and a thing best agreeing to nature. The lawes of Princes also doe seuerely prohibit, that no contract be made of ma∣trimony<NOTE PLACE="marg">De nuptiis tit. decimo.</NOTE> without the consent of Parents. Looke in the first booke of <HI>Iustiniane,</HI> in the title of marriage the 10. where hée treateth of this thing at large. <HI>Filij filiaeue consensum parentum habeant, quorum sunt in potestate: <HI>Let the sonnes or daughters haue the cōsent of parents, vnder whose power &amp; gouernment they are.</HI></HI> For this thing ought to be, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Franciscus Barbarus.</NOTE> both the ciuill lawe, and the lawe of nature doeth counsel and per∣suade, that the commaundement &amp; consent of the father ought to procéed &amp; go before the marriage. <HI>Franciscus Barbarus</HI> is of the same minde, saying after this maner: We doe forewarne &amp; tell you, that there can be ascribed no excellencie or worthinesse vnto y<SUP>•</SUP> mariage, to the which the good will &amp; consent of the father hath not béene had before. The example of <HI>Cyrus</HI> may also teach all youth what aun∣swere<NOTE PLACE="marg">The example of <HI>Cyrus.</HI> King of <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE> to make in that behalf, who (when hée was moued and per∣suaded by certaine friendes to take to wife a great and noble wo∣man, &amp; that with a verie great dowrie and large summe of mony) answered: <HI>Se non antè velle, quàm a parentibus collaudari certior esset. <HI>That he would not marrie her, before he had heard from the mouth of his Parentes, that she was a meete match for him, &amp; a woman worthie praise and commendation.</HI></HI> By the example of this noble King, all young men may be admonished, that they linke not them selues in matri∣monie, except first they conferre, &amp; desire the good will and cōsent of their Parentes, maisters, and gouernours: For if Parentes at all times, &amp; in all places be to be honoured, reuerenced, &amp; regarded, and that in the smallest thinges, much more in so great and waightie a cause, the wise &amp; prudēt counsell of parents is to be heard, followed and embraced, except a man will make no account nor reckoning of the commaundement of Almightie God</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="104"/><HI>Euaristus</HI> a Bishop of <HI>Greece,</HI> iudged priuie contractes in Matri∣mony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euaristus.</NOTE> very vnlawfully instituted, &amp; ordeined that the bridegrome and bride, should be ioyned together of the Priest or Minister in the face of the congregation. It is the parte and duetie of Parentes to place and bestow their children, and not of the children to bestowe them selues at their pleasure (albeit it is great reason that their willes and consents agrée thereunto) and the ordinance of God re∣quireth the same. <HI>Deut. 22.</HI> Abraham prepared a marriage for his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 22.

And as the children haue this libertie, to be willing and giue their consents vnto their contractes in marriage, and that their Parents ought not to force them against their willes: So is it not lawfull for the children to contract and ioyne them selues in matrimony at their owne willes and pleasures, without the authoritie &amp; consent of their Parentes. For it is the ordinaunce of God▪ that children honour and obey their Parentes, and follow their mindes &amp; coun∣sell in contracting them selues vnto mariage. Most gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enously ther∣fore doe those children offend, which contemning the authoritie of their Parents, enterprise mariage without their consent▪ For then they doe not honour them, but rather procure their shame and re∣proch, which so great wickednesse God wil not suffer vnpunished. Daily examples doe continually &amp; sufficiently teach vs, that God is excéedingly offended and angrie with these contemners of Pa∣rentes, whom Satan hath rather ioyned together, then God: be∣cause hée is not the worker of iniquitie, and to sinne against the fift commaundement, is great iniquitie.</P>

<P>Those priuie spousages and secret contractes therfore; enterprised and taken in hand without the consent of Parentes, are not to be liked, appro∣ued nor allowed, as farre as I can gather of your wordes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gather of my wordes verie wisely, for these stollen &amp; pri∣uie contractes, affiances and betrothinges, are not only forbidden and prohibited by the lawes of Princes, but also by examples and testimonies out of the holie scriptures, as wée haue before suffici∣ently proued.</P>
<P><PB REF="105"/>Therefore let Parentes beare this alwayes in minde, that the right and authoritie to place and bestowe their children, is giuen and attributed vnto them of God: And let children knowe, that they (as it hath béene often said) owe this reuerence and obedience vnto their Parentes, that they séeke for their counsell, and earnest∣ly craue and desire their good wils in these cases That young man which is of age, wisedome, discretion, and méet to take a wife, may not be afraide nor ashamed, to reueale his secretes, and open his minde vnto his Parentes, that hée woulde be glad (if it were his fathers pleasure) to match him selfe with some honest and godlie mayde, and therfore humbly desireth his Parents good will, coun∣sell, and furtheraunce in that behalfe, that of many of his famili∣ers and acquaintaunce, hée might choose such a one as should bée to their liking: And albeit this may séeme to be some signe of lust and vnshamefastnesse, yet let them know and vnderstand, that the di∣uine clemencie doeth couer this in marriage, and addeth a remedie vnto this disease and malladie. Therefore let children humble them selues before their Parentes, and most lowly and gentely say, (my good father and mother) let mée haue I pray you suche a honest and godly young man or mayde, whom I loue in the feare of the Lorde, and in the way of wedlocke and lawfull matrimony, if hée or shée shall be thought worthie and meete for your affinitie, kindred, stocke, and Parentage, honest and wise Parentes will not deny the thing, that is in such wise so honestly, &amp; in such hum∣ble maner required, although the dowrie, goods, or summes of mo∣ny, be not altogether answerable to their desire and wish. And such marriages, cannot be but happie, prosperous, &amp; fortunate, because God with his vnmeasurable and excéeding goodnesse doeth blesse, fauour, and as it were with this vaile and couer of wedlocke doeth hide, kéepe secrete, defende and alay this excéeding heat and seruen∣cie of lust, and also the holie scriptures doeth approue, and for ex∣ample bringeth foorth the loue and voice of the Bride: after this maner doth God not only pardon our filthinesse and miserable lust wherein wée were conceiued and borne, but also adorne and make vs more honourable, by and through lawfull matrimony.</P>

<P>What is your counsell I pray you? If after the affiances and spousalles once done, they proceede to their nuptiall day &amp; act of generation against
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
the will and consent of their Parentes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theodidactus.</SPEAKER>
<P>This we ought to knowe and vnderstand, that after such com∣mixion and coupling of them selues together, they may not be se∣uered, nor disioyned, neither may such marriages be broken by the authoritie of their Parents: for because there is now no question of any marriage to come, and the authoritie of Parentes is alrea∣die violated and corrupted, so that great iniurie shoulde be offered vnto the woman, if shee should be cast off againe and forsaken. And to conclude, I will adde this one thing, that it doeth appertaine as wel to the duetie of Parents, as of Iudges, for they ought to weigh and consider, where, and in what cases the fathers may haue a pro∣bable cause to breake the marriage, and where not, which causes I will leaue to be discided, of the Diuines, and such as haue to deale in those nuptiall affaires. Beséeching Almightie God to graunt your children good successe, and to bestow his blessings on them, as well in this single life, as also in that married estate, whensoeuer it shall hereafter please him, to all your comfortes, and his euerlasting glorie, to whom be praise for euer,</P>
