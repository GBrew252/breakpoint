<HEAD>A true Relation of the late Battell
fought in New England, between the
English and Salvages, with the present
state of things there.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NEw England,</HI> a name now
every day more famous,
is so called, because the
English were the first
Discoverers, &amp; are now
the Planters thereof. It
is the Easterne Coast of
the North part of <HI>America,</HI> upon the
Southwest adjoyning to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and
part of that Continent, large and capable
of innumerable people. It is in the same
height with the North of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and
South part of <HI>France,</HI> and the temper not
much unlike, as pleasant, as temperate and
as fertile as either, if managed by industri∣ous
hands.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>This is the Stage. Let us in a word see
the Actors. The yeare 1620, a Company
of English part out of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI>
and some out of <HI>London</HI> and other parts,
were sent for <HI>Virginia.</HI> But being cut
short by want of wind, and hardnesse of
the Winter, they landed themselves in
this Countrey, enduring, with great hope
and patience, all the misery that Desart
could put upon them, and imployed their
wits to make their best use of that then
Snow-covered land for their necessities.
After two yeares experience of the nature
of the soyle, commodities, and natives,
they returned such intelligence to their
Masters, that others tooke notice of their
endevours, and the place. Then some
Westerne Merchants collected a stocke,
and employed it that way. But they dis∣couraged
through losses, and want of
present gaine, some Londoners, and
others (men of worth) undertooke it,
with more resolution, building upon the
old foundation. Hence a second planta∣tion
adjoyned to the other, but supported
<PB REF="4"/>
with better pillars, and greater meanes.
All beginnings are ever difficult. The
halfe, saith the Proverbe, is more then the
whole. Some errours were committed,
and many miseries were endured. No
man is wise enough to shunne all evils
that may happen; but patience and
painefulnesse overcame all. The successe
proved answerable even to ambitious ex∣pectations,
notwithstanding the impedi∣ments
inevitable to such undertakings.</P>
<P>There is scarce any part of the world
but habitable, though more commodi∣ously
by humane culture. This part
(though in it's Naturals) nourished ma∣ny
natives, distinguished into divers petty
nations and factions. It were needlesse
curiosity to dispute their originall, or
how they came hither. Their outsides say
they are men, their actions say they are rea∣sonable.
As the thing is, so it operateth.
Their correspondency of disposition with
us, argueth all to be of the same constitu∣tion,
&amp; the sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and that we had
the same Maker, the same matter, the same
<PB REF="5"/>
mould. Only <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> have given us
that perfection, which yet they want, but
may perhaps be as capable therèof as we.
They are of person straight and tall, of
limbes big and strong, seldome seene vio∣lent,
or extreme in any passion. Naked
they go except a skin about their waste,
and sometimes a Mantle about their
shoulders. Armed they are with Bowes
and Arrowes, Clubs, Iavelins, &amp;c. But as
soyle, aire, diet; &amp; custome make ofttimes
a memorable difference in mens natures,
so is it among these Nations, whose coun∣tries
there are like so many Shires here, of
which every onè hath their Sagamore, or
King, who as occasion urgeth, comman∣deth
them in Warre, and ruleth them in
Peace. Those where the <HI>English</HI> pitched,
have shewed themselves very loving and
friendly, and done courtesies beyond ex∣pectation
for these new-come Inmates.
So that much hath beene written of their
civilitie and peacefull conversation, untill
this yeare.</P>
<P>But Nature, heavens daughter, and the
<PB REF="5"/>
immediate character of that divine pow∣er,
as by her light she hath taught us wise∣dome,
for our owne defence, so by her
fire she hath made us fierce, injurious, re∣vengefull,
and ingenious in the device of
meanes for the offence of those we take
to be our enemies. This is seene in crea∣tures
voide of reason, much more in man∣kind.
We have in us a mixture of all the
Elements, and fire is predominant when
the humours are exagitated. All motion
causeth heat. All provocation mooveth
choller, and choller inflamed, becom∣meth
a phrensie, a fury, especially in bar∣barous
and cruell natures. These things
are conspicuous in the Inhabitants of
<HI>New England.</HI> In whose Southermost
part are the <HI>Pequets,</HI> or <HI>Pequants,</HI> a stately
warlike people, which have been terrible
to their neighbours, and troublesome to
the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> last they killed some
<HI>English</HI> at <HI>Sea-brooke,</HI> a Southerly Planta∣tion
beyond <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> at the mouth of the
River of <HI>Connectacutt.</HI> Since that the
<PB REF="6"/>
Lievtenant of the Fort there, with tenne
men armed, went out to fire the Med∣dowes,
and to fit them for mowing. Ar∣riving
there he started three <HI>Indians,</HI>
which he pursued a little way, thinking
to cut them off. But presently they per∣ceived
themselves incompassed with
hundreds of them, who let flie their ar∣rowes
furiously, and came desperately up∣on
the musles of their Muskets, though
the <HI>English</HI> discharged upon them, with
all the speed they could. Three <HI>English</HI>
men were were slaine, others wounded.
The eight that remained, made their way
through the <HI>Salvages</HI> with their swords,
and so got under the command of the
Canon of the Fort, (otherwise they had
been all slaine, or taken prisoners) one of
the wounded falling downe dead at the
Forts Gate The <HI>Indians</HI> thus fleshed and
encouraged, besieged the Fort as neere as
they durst approach. The besieged pre∣sently
dispatched a messenger to the Go∣vernour
at the <HI>Bay,</HI> to acquaint him with
these sad tidings, who with all speed lent
<PB REF="6"/>
unto their aide, Captaine <HI>Vnderhill,</HI> with
twenty souldiers. Not long after these
<HI>Salvages</HI> went to <HI>Water-Towne,</HI> now cal∣led
<HI>Wetherfield,</HI> and there fell upon some
that were sawing, and slew nine more,
whereof one was a woman, the other a
childe, and tooke two yong Maids priso∣ners,
killing some of their cattell, and dri∣ving
some away. Mans nature insulteth
in victory and prosperity, and by good
successe is animated even in the worst of
wicked actions. These <HI>Barbarians</HI> trium∣phed
and proceeded, drawing into their
Confederacy other <HI>Indians,</HI> as the <HI>Nyante∣cets,</HI>
and part of the <HI>Mohigens;</HI> of whom
about fifty chose rather to joyne with the
<HI>English,</HI> and sat downe at <HI>New-Towne,</HI> at
<HI>Connectacut</HI> (now called <HI>Hereford,</HI> as the
other Towne that went from <HI>Dorchester</HI>
thither is called <HI>Windsore.</HI>) Fame encrea∣seth
by flying. The former sad newes was
augmented by the report of sixtie men
slaine at Master <HI>Pinch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> Plantation, &amp;c.
which proved false. The <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>gansets</HI>
neighbours to the <HI>Pequets,</HI> sent word to
<PB REF="7"/>
the <HI>English</HI> that the <HI>Pequets</HI> had sollicited
them to joyne their forces with them.
Hereupon the Councell ordered that
none should go to worke, nor travell, no
not so much as to Church, without Arms.
A Corps of Guard of 14. or 15 souldiers
was appointed to watch every night, and
Centinels were set in convenient places
about the Plantations, the. Drumme bea∣ting
when they went to the Watch, and
every man commanded to be in readi∣nesse
upon an Alarme, upon paine of five
pound. A day of fast and prayers was also
kept. Fourty more were sent to streng∣then
the former twenty that went to the
Fort, and 50 under the command of Cap∣tain
<HI>Mason,</HI> which being conjoyned, were
about100. Two hundred more were to
be sent after them with all expedition.</P>
<P>The 50 <HI>Mohigins</HI> that joyned with the
<HI>English,</HI> scouring about, espied <HI>7 Pequets,</HI>
killed five of them outright, wounded the
sixt mortally, took<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the seventh prisoner,
and brought him to the Fort. He braved
the <HI>English,</HI> as though they durst not kill a
<PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Pequet.</HI> Some will have their courage to be
thought invincible, when all is desperate. But
it availed this Salvage nothing; they tied one
of his legs to a post, and 20 men with a rope
tied to the other, pulled him in pieces, Captain
<HI>Vnderhill</HI> shooting a pistol through him, to dis∣patch
him. The two Maids which were taken
prisoners were redeemed by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Those 50 sent from the three plantations of
<HI>Connectacut</HI> with Captain <HI>Mason,</HI> being joyned
with Captain <HI>Vnderhill</HI> and his 20 men, (for
the other 40 were not yet arrived with them)
immediately went upon an expedition against
the <HI>Pequets,</HI> after they had searched for them.
The manner was this. The <HI>English</HI> with some
<HI>Mohigens</HI> went to the <HI>Naragonsets,</HI> who were
discontented that they came no sooner, saying
they could arme and set forth two or three
hundred at six houres warning, (which they
did accordingly, for the assistance of the <HI>Eng∣lish)</HI>
onely they desired the advice of the <HI>Saga∣more,
Mydutonno,</HI> what way they should go to
worke, and how they should fall on the <HI>Pe∣quets;</HI>
whose judgement, in all things, agreed
with the <HI>English,</HI> as though they had consulted
together. Then went they to the <HI>Nyanticke,</HI> and
<PB REF="8"/>
he set forth 200 more, but before they went, he
swore them after his maner upon their knees.
As they marched they deliberated which Fort
of the <HI>Pequets</HI> they should assault, resolving
upon the great Fort, and to be there that night.
Being on the way, and having a mile to march
through woods and Swamps, the <HI>Nyanticke</HI>
hearts failed, for feare of the <HI>Pequets,</HI> and so
they ran away, as also did some of the <HI>Narra∣gansets.</HI>
Of five or 600 <HI>Indians,</HI> not above halfe
were left: and they had followed the rest had
not Capttaine <HI>Vnderhill</HI> upbraided them with
cowardise, and promised them they should
not fight or come within shot of the Fort, but
onely surround it afarre off. At breake of day
the 70 <HI>English</HI> gave the Fort a Volly of shot,
whereat the <HI>Salvages</HI> within made an hide∣ous
and pittifull cry, the shot without all que∣stion
flying through the <HI>Pallisadoes</HI> (Which
stood not very close) and killing or wounding
some of them. Pitty had hindred further hostile
proceedings, had not the remembrance of the
bloodshed, the captive Maid, and cruell inso∣lency
of those <HI>Pequets,</HI> hardned the hearts of the
<HI>English,</HI> &amp; stopped their eares unto their cries.
Mercy marres all somtimes, severe Iustice must
now and then take place.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="8"/>The long forbearance, and too much lenitie of
the English toward the Virginian Salvages, had
like to have beene the destruction of the whole
Plantation. These Barbarians (ever treacherous)
abuse the goodnesse of those that condescend to
their rudenesse and imperfections. The English
went, resolutely up to the dore of the Fort. What
shall wee enter said Captaine <HI>Vnder-hill?</HI> What
come we for else? answered one <HI>Hedge,</HI> a young
Northampton-shire gentleman: who advancing
before the rest, pluckt away some bushes and en∣tred.
A stout Pequet encounters him, shootes his
arrow (drawne to the head) into his right arme,
where it stuck. He slasht the Salvage betwixt the
arme and shoulder, who pressing towards the
dore, was killed by the English. Immediatly Ma∣ster
<HI>Hedge</HI> incountred another, who perceiving
him upon him before he could deliver his arrow,
gave backe: but he struck up his heeles and run
him thorow; after him hee killed two or three
more. Then about halfe the English entred, fell on
with courage, and slew manie. But being strait∣ned
for roome because of the Wigwams (which
are the Salvage huts or cabins) they called for fire
to burne them. An English man stept into a Wig∣wam
and stooping for a fire-brand, an Indian
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
was ready to knock out his braines. But he whipt
out his sword and runne him into the belly, that
his bowels followed. Then were the Wigwams
set on fire, which so raged, that what therewith,
what with the sword, in little more than an
houre, betwixt three and foure hundred of them
were killed, and of the English onely two, one of
them by our owne Muskets, as is thought. For
the Narragansets beset the Fort so close, that not
one escaped. The whole worke ended, ere the
Sun was an houre high, the Conquerors retraited
downe toward the Pinnace, but in their march
were infested by the rest of the Pequets: Who
scouting up and downe, from the swamps and
thickets let flie their arrowes amaine, which were
answered by English bullets. The Indians that
then assisted the English, waiting the fall of the
Pequets,(as the dogge watcheth the shot of the
fouler to fetch the prey) still fetched them their
heades, as any were slaine. At last the Narragan∣sets
perceiving powder and shot to faile, and fea∣ring
to fall into the hands of their enemies, be∣tooke
themselves to flight upon the sudden, and
were as suddenly encompassed by the Pequets:
Feare defeateth great armies. If an apprehension
of eminent danger once possesse them, it is in
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
vaine to stay the runne awaies. No oratory can re∣call
them, no command can order them againe.
The onely sure way, is by all meanes that may be,
promises, threats, perswasions, &amp;c. to maintaine
and keepe up courage, where yet it is. But these
fearefull companions had one Anchor, whose
cable was not broken. They sent speedily to the
English, who came to their reskew: and after five
Muskets discharged the Pequets fled. Thus freed
from that feare, they vowed henceforth to cleave
closer to the English, and never to forsake them
in time of need. The reason why the Englsh wan∣ted
amunition was, because they had left that
which they had for store with their drum at the
place of their consultation: But found it in their
returne. They now all went a ship-board and say∣led
to Seabrooke-Fort, where the English feasted
the Narragansets three daies, and then sent them
home in a pinnace.</P>
<P>Let mee now describe this military fortresse
which naturall reason &amp; experience hath taught
them to erect, without mathematicall skill, or
use of yron toole. They choose a piece of ground
dry and of best advantage, forty or fifty foote
square. (But this was at least 2 acres of ground.)
here they pitch close together, as they can young
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
trees and halfe trees, as thicke as a mans thigh,
or the calfe of his legge. Ten or twelve foote
high they are above the ground, and within ram∣med
three foote deepe, with undermining, the
earth being cast up for their better shelter against
the enemies dischargements. Betwixt these pal∣lisadoes
are divers loope-holes, through which
they let flie their winged messengers. The doore
for the most part is entred side-waies, which
they stop with boughes or bushes as need requi∣reth.
The space within is full of Wigwams, where∣in
their wives and children live with them.
These huts or little houses are framed like our
garden arbours, something more round, very
strong and handsome, covered with close
wrought mats, made by their women of flagges,
rushes, and hempen threds, so defensive, that
neither raine, though never so sad and long, nor
yet the winde, though never so strong can enter.
The top through a square hole giveth passage to
the smoke, which in rainy weather, is covered
with a pluver. This Fort was so crowded with
these numerous dwellings, that the English wan∣ted
foote-roome to graple with their adversaries,
and therefore set fire on all.</P>
<P>The Mohigens which sided with the English
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
in this action behaved themselves stoutly.
Which the other Pequets understanding, cut off
all the Mohigens that remaine with them, (lest
they should turne to the English) except seven:
who flying to our Countrey-men related this
newes, and that about an hundred Pequets were
slaine or hurt, in the fight with the English at
their returne from the Fort. Moreover that they
had resolved to have sent an hundred choyce
men out of their Fort as a party against the
English, the very day after they were beaten out
by them. But being now vanquished Sasacus the
Pequetan Captaine, with the remainder of this
massacre was fled the Countrey.</P>
<P>It is not good to give breathing to a beaten
enemy, lest he returne armed if not with greater
puissance, yet with greater despight and revenge.
Too much security or neglect in this kinde hath
oft times ruined the Conquerours. The 200 En∣glish
therefore, resolved on before, were now sent
forth to chase the Barbarians and utterly roote
them out. Whereupon Cap. <HI>Vnderhill</HI> with his
20 men returned and gave this account of those
exploits of the New-Englanders, which here we
have communicated to the old English world.
This last partie invaded the Pequetan Countrie,
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
killed twenty three, saved the lives of two Saga∣mores
for their use hereafter, as occasion shall
serve, who have promised to doe great matters
for the advancing of the English affaires. They
pursued the remnant threescore miles beyond the
Country (till within 36. miles of the Dutch plan∣tations
on <HI>Hudsons</HI> river) where they fought with
them, killed fortie or fiftie besides those that they
cut off in their retrait, and tooke prisoners 180,
that came out of a Swampe and yeilded them∣selves
upon promise of good quarter. Some o∣ther
small parties of them were since destroyed,
and Captaine <HI>Patrick</HI> with 16. or 18. brought 80
Captives to the Bay of <HI>Boston.</HI> The newes of the
flight of <HI>Sassacus</HI> their Sagamore, is also confir∣med.
He went with forty men to the Mowhacks,
which are cruell bloodie Caniballs, and the most
terrible to their neighbours of all these nations:
but will scarce dare ever to carrie armes against
the English, of whom they are sore afraid,
not daring to encounter white men with their
hot-mouth'd weapons, which spit nothing
else but bullets and fire.</P>
<P>The terrour of victorie changeth even the affe∣ction
of the allies of the vanquished, and the se∣curing
of our owne estates makes us neglect, yea
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
forsake, or turne against our confederates, and side
with their enemies and ours, when wee despaire
of better remedie. These cruell, but wily Mow∣hacks,
in contemplation of the English, and to
procure their friendship, entertaine the fugitive
Pequets and their Captaine, by cutting off all
their heads and hands, which they sent to the
English, as a testimony of their love and service.</P>
<P>A day of thanksgiving was solemnly celebra∣ted
for this happie successe, the Pequetans now
seeming nothing but a name, for not lesse than
700. are slaine or taken prisoners. Of the English
are not slaine in all above 16. One occurrent <HI>I</HI>
may not forget. The endeavours of private men
are ever memorable in these beginnings: the
meanest of the vulgar is not incapable of vertue,
and consequently neither of honour. Some acti∣ons
of <HI>Plebeians</HI> have elsewhere beene taken for
great atchievements. A pretty sturdy youth of
new <HI>Ipswich,</HI> going forth, somewhat rashly, to
pursue the Salvages, shot off his Musket after
them till all his powder and shot were spent;
which they perceiving, re-assaulted him, thinking
with their hatchets to have knocked him in the
head. But he so bestirred himselfe with the stock
of his piece, and after with the barrell, when that
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
was broken, that hee brought two of their heads
to the armie. His owne desert and the incou∣ragement
of others will not suffer him to bee
namelesse. Hee is called <HI>Francis Waine-wright,</HI>
and came over servant with one <HI>Alexander
Knight</HI> that kept an Inne in <HI>Chelmsford.</HI></P>
<P>I have done with this tragick scene, whose ca∣tastrophe
ended in a triumph. And now give
mee leave to speake something of the present
state of things there. The transcribing of all
Colonies is chargeable, fittest for Princes or
states to undertake. Their first beginnings are
full of casuality and danger, and obnoxious to
many miseries. They must bee well grounded,
well followed, and mannaged with great stocks
of money, by men of resolution, that will not
bee daunted by ordinarie accidents. The <HI>Ber∣muda's</HI>
and <HI>Virginia</HI> are come to perfection from
meane, or rather base beginnings, and almost
by as weake meanes, beyond all expectation,
and reason. But a few private men by uniting
their stocks and desires have now raised new∣England
to that height, that never any planta∣tion
of Spaniards, Dutch, or any other arrived
at in so small a time. Gaine is the load-stone of
adventures: Fish and Furres, with Beaver wooll,
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
were specious baites. But whiles men are
all for their private profit, the publique
good is neglected and languisheth. Woe∣full
experience had too evidently instru∣cted
New Englands Colones in the prece∣dents
of Guiana, the Charibe Ilands, Vir∣ginia,
and Novonia, or New-found-land,
(now againe to bee planted by Sir <HI>David
Kirke,</HI> though part of the old planters
there yet remaine.) Wee are never wiser,
than when wee are thus taught. The new
Englanders therefore advanced the weale
publique all they could, and so the private
is taken care for.</P>
<P>Corne and Cattell are wonderfully en∣creased
with them, and thereof they have
enough, yea sometime to spare to new
commers, besides spare roomes, or good
houses to entertaine them in. Where they
may make Christmas fires all winter, if they
please for nothing. I speake not of the na∣turals
of the Countrey, fish, fowle, &amp;c.
which are more than plentifull. They that
arrived there this yeere out of divers parts
of Old England say that they never saw
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
such a field of 400 acres of all sorts of
English graine as they saw at Winter-towne
there. Yet that ground is not comparable
to other parts of New England, as Salem,
Ipswich, Newberry, &amp;c. In a word, they
have built faire Townes of the lands owne
materials, and faire Ships too, some where
of are here to be seene on the Thames. They
have overcome cold and hunger, are dis∣pearsed
securely in their Plantations sixty
miles along the coast, and within the Land
also along some small Creekes and Rivers,
and are assured of their peace by killing the
Barbarians, better than our English Virgi∣nians
were by being killed by them. For ha∣ving
once terrified them, by severe execu∣tion
of just revenge, they shall never heare
of more harme from them, except (perhaps)
the killing of a man or two at his worke,
upon advantage, which their Centinels,
and Corps du guards may easily prevent.
Nay, they shall have those bruites their
servants, their slaves, either willingly
or of necessity, and docible enough, if
not obsequious. The numbers of the
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
English amount to above thirty thou∣sand,
which (though none did augment
them out of England) shall every day bee,
doubtlesse, encreased, by a facultie that
God hath given the Brittish Ilanders
to beget and bring forth more children,
than any other nation of the world: I
could justifie what <HI>I</HI> say from the mouthes
of the Hollanders and adjoyning Provinces,
where they confesse (though good breeders
of themselves) that never woman bore two
children, nor yet had so many by one
man, till the English and Scotch frequen∣ted
their warres and married with them. I
could give a good reason hereof from na∣ture,
as a Philosopher (with modestie bee
it spoken) but there is no neede. The aire
of new England, and the Diet equall, if not
excelling that of old England: besides their
honour of marriage, and carefull preven∣ting
and punishing of furtive congression
giveth them and us no small hope of their
future puissance, and multitude of subjects.
Herein, saith the Wiseman, consisteth the
strength of a King, and likewise of a nation,
or Kingdome.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="14"/>But the desire of more gaine, the slavery
of mankinde, was not the onely cause of our
English endeavours for a plantation there.
The propagation of Religion was that pre∣cious
jewell, for which these Merchant ven∣turers
compassed both Sea and Land, and
went into a farre Country to search and seat
themselves. This, I am sure, they pretended,
and I hope intended. Onely this blessing
from my heart I sincerely wish them, and
shall ever beseech the Almightie to bestow
upon them, devout Piety towards God,
faithfull loyaltie towards their Soveraigne,
fervent charity among themselves, and dis∣cretion
and sobriety in themselves, accor∣ding
to the saying of that blessed Apostle,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
Rom 12. 3. Not to bee wise (in spirituall
things) above what wee ought to bee wise;
but to bee wise unto wise sobriety.</P>
<P>Doubtlesse there was no other way bet∣ter
to chastise the insolencie of these insulting
homicides, than a sharpe warre pursued with
dexterity and speed. <HI>Virginia</HI> our mother
plantation, and for her precedent a rule, hath
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
taught us what to do in these difficulties; fore∣warned,
forearmed. They were endangered
by their friendship and peace, secured by their
enmity and warre with the natives. From
these experiments, shall the now inhabitants
of those two Sister Lands, beat out unto
themselves an Armour of proofe, and lay
a sure foundation to their future happi∣nesse.</P>
