<HEAD>A memoriall of the fa∣mous monumentes, and charitable almesdeedes of the Right worshipfull Mai∣ster William Lambe Esquire, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>Iue me leaue (good Christians) to com∣mend to memorie the notable actes and fa∣mous monuments of a right Gentleman, loued in his life, and lamented at his death: whose praises to suppresse with silence, si∣thence they are deserued and not sought, it were a wrong, as I iudge in conscience, which the verie <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Monuments of memorie were vsuall a∣mong the Heathen.</HI></NOTE> Hea∣then would not once conceiue, much lesse commit, if they had béene (as we are) eie and eare witnesses of his me∣ritorious déedes. Giue me leaue (I say) for the glorie of God, and the memorie of the Gentleman, to re∣port


<PB REF="3"/>
vnto the world, or at least to the people of this land, not the visions of a vaine head, not the sudden deuises of an vnstaied braine, not the rashe rimes of a running penne, not the bolde babling of an imagined lie, not the cunning conueiance of a wanton toy, &amp;c. but <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The Argu∣ment of this small pam∣phlet.</HI></NOTE> the determinations of a deuout minde, the precise purposes of a settled heart, the commendable workes of a liberall hand, the verie certeintie of an vndoubted trueth, which is worthie, not to be printed in white and blacke, but to be grauen in Marble with letters of golde, in the memoriall of him after death, whose déedes did sufficiently aduaunce him in his life.</P>
<P>A great matter, &amp; of more impor∣tance than the cōmon sort of people can conceiue, to vndertake the blaso∣ning of so <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The memo∣rie of whome shall neuer die.</HI></NOTE> vertuous a mans mani∣fold benefits▪ wherin as I want wit to write as he is worthie, so I lacke skill to dispose and order the sundrie circumstances, which offer them∣selues to my barren inuention, tou∣ching


<PB REF="3"/>
his last will and testament. There are missing in me the méetest meanes in this matter, quickenesse of capacitie, smoothnesse of spéeche, ripenesse of iudgement: I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Presuppo∣sed impedi∣ments con∣cerning the writer.</HI></NOTE> am a stranger, or rather a nouesse in af∣faires of the worlde, vnacquainted with the trades of men, as called to a more solitarie life: which (besides other vnremembred) are impedi∣ments, wherby I shal séeme so much the more insufficient to accomplishe this enterprise, by how much I am to complaine of the want of know∣ledge and experience. Againe, my methode will be more marked, for his sake concerning whom it is pur∣posely penned: and in some thing wherein I thinke my selfe not to haue offended, I may do amisse, and so incurre controlment. For where manie eies are fixed, manie faultes may be found: and manie mindes may soone iudge where a thing may be amended.</P>
<P>But I, though not cunning, yet carefull to deliuer in due order <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>According to the tenour of the Testators owne last will &amp; testament.</HI></NOTE> the


<PB REF="4"/>
trueth of this Gentlemans almes∣déedes: beséech all such as shall per∣vse this pamphlet, not so much to descant vpon the writers rude and vnpolished report, as looking for some deintie deuise to tickle their it∣ching eares: but to behold with ear∣nest eies the Testatours bountifull bequests, which as they cannot, be∣ing so charitable, but smell swéete in the Lords sight, euen so they deserue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Two necessa∣rie things wished.</HI></NOTE> a pithie commemoration, which I woulde to God I were able to com∣passe: and (if it could be) an effectu∣all imitation, which the Lord God worke in the hearts of all them that are wealthie.</P>
<P>To come therfore to our purpose, a custome it hath béene both ancient and famous, not onely among Pa∣gans, with whome in déedes of de∣uotion I intende not to deale, but al∣so among people fearing God, and addicted to the extolling of his name, that the notable actes of such persons as were singular, shoulde not sléepe in obliuion, but by one monument


<PB REF="4"/>
or other made immortall. Herevpon some by one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Prophane writers verifie this matter.</HI></NOTE> solemne ceremonie, some by another, had that honour and renowme done vnto them after death, by some notable deuise of man, were it either workmanship of the hande, or inuention of the heade, which did as it were reuiue, &amp; restore them againe to life. Among all the rest, passing ouer a multitude, we shall sée, euen in the sacred Scrip∣tures, that the holie Ghost hath vouchsafed some such speciall and so∣uereigne dignitie, as to haue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The memo∣rie of whome is euerlasting.</HI></NOTE> their names registred euen in the Bible, their vertues extolled, their déedes aduaunced: partly that the remem∣brance of them should neuer die, and partly to be prouocations vnto vs to walke worthie of our calling.</P>
<P>This to be a truth, the verie touch∣stone of trueth doeth testifie. For, there is none so ignorant, but can quickly call to memorie, where men∣tion is made of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eight tripli∣cities of no∣table and fa∣mous men.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Enoch, Noe, and Abraham: Isaach, Iacob, and Ioseph: Moses, Aaron, and Phinees: Iosue,


<PB REF="5"/>
Caleb, and Samuel: Nathan, Dauid, and Salomon: Elias, Elizeus, and E∣zekias: Ieremie, Ezechiel, Zoroba∣bel: Neemias, Sem, and Seth, &amp;c.</HI> ho∣lie and approued men in the eies of the highest: &amp; commended in Scrip∣ture, some for their faithfulnesse, some for their méekenesse, some for their wisedome, some for their inno∣cencie, some for their valiantnesse, some for their riches, some for their glorie, some for one blessing of God, and some for another.</P>
<P>Wherein <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Obseruati∣ons to be noted.</HI></NOTE> is to be obserued, first the loue of God towardes his elect, in that he vouchsafeth his seruants so notable a register: Secondly the rare vertues wherewith they were indued, deseruing immortall memo∣rie: Thirdly that the wicked are not recorded, but for the reuiuing of their reproch: And fourthly that the remembrance of both, might bréede in vs a desire to doe well, that good may growe thereby: and a detesting of the contrarie, which commonly bringeth shame.</P>
<P>

<PB REF="5"/>The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The offence of Cain made his name o∣dious.</HI></NOTE> name of <HI>Cain,</HI> or the report of his déedes, are they written to his commendation? Nothing lesse. For as the offence which he committed was heinous, so is his name odious. As well then are the wicked recor∣ded, as the righteous: that by a view of eithers life, our election might be the better grounded. Few fathers that loue their children, will baptise them by the name of <HI>Absalon,</HI> of <HI>A∣chitophel,</HI> of <HI>Hamman,</HI> of <HI>Iudas</HI>? And why? Because the course of these mens conuersation was so accurssed, that they became abhomi∣nable whiles they liued: and though their bodies in tract of time putrified &amp; waxed rotten, yet the holie Ghost by committing their actes to memo∣rie, hath doubled their infamie.</P>
<P>So then the sequele of all is this, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Both good and bad regi∣stred in the Bible.</HI></NOTE> as well the wicked as the righ∣teous haue their remembraunce in Gods booke: but in contrarie re∣spects, the one to become more fa∣mous, the other more infamous: the one more beloued, the other more


<PB REF="6"/>
hated: the one more honoured, the o∣ther more abhorred: the one more followed as commendable, the other more eschewed as condemnable. What praise hath the proud Phari∣sie by his memoriall in the Gospell? His hypocrisie turneth his glorie in∣to shame. What renowme the riche glutton, what fame the thriftles ser∣uant, what aduancement the vnre∣pentant théefe? The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Not without the grace of God.</HI></NOTE> Publicane was iustified, poore Lazarus glorifi∣ed, the trustie seruant rewarded, the sorowfull théefe receiued, and all this appeareth manifest in the volume of the Bible, as monuments which no age, no time, no season shal consume.</P>
<P>Doe you not remember, that the holie Ghost speaketh of a couetous miser, a wretch, a worldling, one that very buisily occupied his head about inlarging his barnes, that his soule might be more merrie in the middest of his abundance: not mindfull in the meane space of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>This night they shall fetch thy soule from thee.</HI></NOTE> shortnes of his iournie? Beléeue me, this is written no more to his commendation, than


<PB REF="6"/>
the pretended innocencie of Pilate in condemning Christe, is noted to his honour. And now to riche men I must direct the summe of all my spéech: for hauing to deale with the distribution of riches, how can I o∣mit such a néedefull common place?</P>
<P>It is a sore saieng of <HI>S. Iames,</HI> which he vseth to the wealthie of the world, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>A hard rec∣koning for rich men.</HI></NOTE><HI>Go to now ye rich men, weepe and howle for your miseries that shall come vpon you. Your riches are cor∣rupt, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold &amp; siluer is cankred, and the rust of them shalbe a witnes against you, and shall eate your flesh as it were fire, &amp;c.</HI> The place is knowne. They are bitter wordes of <HI>S. Paule,</HI> touching the same matter, that <HI>Such as wil be rich fall into ten∣tation and snares, &amp; into many foo∣lish &amp; noisome lustes, which drowne men in perdition and destruction. For the desire of monie is the roote of all euill, which while some lusted after, they erred from the faith, and</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>For they are neuer at quiet in themselues, neither in soule nor bodie.</HI></NOTE> <HI>pearced themselues through with


<PB REF="7"/>
many sorrowes.</HI> But a sharpe sen∣tence against such is that of our Sa∣uiour Christ, vttered not with a na∣ked and bare pronuntiation, but con∣firmed with an oth: <HI>Verely I say vn∣to you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdome of heauen.</HI> This is made more manifest by a comparison of impossibilitie, in the wordes following, <HI>It is easier for a camel, (or a cable rope) to goe tho∣rough the eie of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king∣dome of God.</HI> And therfore the good counsell of our Sauiour is to be ta∣ken in due and acceptable time, <HI>To lay vp treasures for our selues in hea∣uen, where neither moth nor canker corrupteth, and where theeues nei∣ther digge through nor steale.</HI></P>
<P>And the example of the yong Gen∣tleman mentioned in the Gospell, being a rich heire, and in possession of much land, is no lesse to be mar∣ked, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Riches an e∣nimie to the saluation of the soule.</HI></NOTE> who after he had béene instruc∣ted what to doe toward the attaine∣ment of eternall life, was likewise


<PB REF="7"/>
exhorted, if he would be perfect, to sell all that he had, &amp; to giue it to the poore. But the hearing of this vnsa∣uorie doctrine stoong him at the hart as loth to buy the ioies of heauen with the losse of his temporall trea∣sures: wherevpon he went away sor∣rowfull, as vnwilling to make so harde a reckoning.</P>
<P>This is a thing not onely worthie rehersall, but also remembrance: and not only remembrance, but also con∣sideration. And though they are but wordes, yet they haue their <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>As procee∣ding from christ and his Apostles.</HI></NOTE> weight, they haue their trueth, they haue their certeintie. <HI>For heauen and earth shall passe, but one worde of the Sonne of man shall not passe,</HI> as our Sauiour testifieth of himselfe. And therefore, will rich men liue in Gods loue, and die in his fauour? Then let them be mercifull, as their heauenly Father is mercifull. Will rich men be at peace with God, and his sonne Christ? Then let them fol∣low him, who said, that <HI>Except they forsake wife, children, kinred, house,


<PB REF="8"/>
landes and life, they are not worthie to be his disciples.</HI></P>
<P>Will riche men so die, that they may liue in the Lorde? Then <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Good coun∣sell for the rich.</HI></NOTE> let them be charitable and pitifull, libe∣rall and bountifull: for the riches wherewith they are blessed, though theirs in possession for the time of their life, yet let them know that the Lorde will one day looke ouer his ac∣counts, &amp; call them to a reckoning. God forbid that rich men should des∣paire of their saluation, because they are rich. <HI>Abraham</HI> was rich, yet was he faithfull: <HI>Lot</HI> rich, yet righteous: <HI>Tobie</HI> rich, yet mercifull: <HI>Iob</HI> rich, yet innocent: <HI>Zacheus</HI> rich, yet boun∣tifull. And therefore, as in former ages, it hath pleased God, with his blessings temporall to knit assured hope of life eternall in the hearts of his chosen: so there is no cause of mis∣trust, but that the Lord <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Some riche men Gods seruants.</HI></NOTE> hath reser∣ued vnto himselfe a remnant of rich men, in these latter daies, though daungerous, whose light shining to the worlde, and their good workes


<PB REF="8"/>
plentifully emploied to the benefite of the comfortlesse, prouoketh euerie godly disposed person to glorifie our Father which is in Heauen.</P>
<P>A rare testimonie hereof may be séene in this famous Citie, euen at this instant, in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Maister Wil∣liam Lambe Esquier.</HI></NOTE> a notable Gentle∣man, whose good déedes bare witnes of his Christianitie in his life, and shall continue the memorie of his charitie after death. Of whome, because it is a trauell purposely vn∣dertaken, I must speake that to his commendation, which he deserueth. And though I cannot applie my pen sufficiently to expresse his praise: yet by the commemoration or recitall of his benefites, euerie indifferent rea∣der will soone gather what is due to such a singular Gentleman.</P>
<P>And first, to touch the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Learning a readie way to honour.</HI></NOTE> instru∣ment of his aduancement, learning I meane, I will say no more than I haue laide before me in writing, and maie boldely exemplifie: that the knowledge &amp; vnderstanding where∣with the Lorde vouchsafed to reple∣nish


<PB REF="9"/>
him, remoued him from a mean estate, to a worshipfull calling: from the Countrie, to the Court: where being placed euen in the Chappell, to serue his souereigne Lord <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Master Lamb in fauor with King Henrie the eight.</HI></NOTE> King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight of immortall me∣morie, of whome he was well liked, and béeloued, he spent his time ap∣pointed in such séemelinesse as might be thought requisite for his degrée and person.</P>
<P>And remembring that learning bringeth preferment, yea euen to them which are but basely borne, as it pleased God to moue him by his good and gratious spirite, he proued himselfe by testimonials of his do∣ings, a louer of learning, and a fa∣uourer of euerie honest profession. For in the towne of <HI>Sutton Valens</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> this worshipfull Gentleman at his owne costs and proper expences erected a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The erection of a Grammar schoole and necessarie al∣lowance to the Maister and Vsher.</HI></NOTE> Grammar schoole for the education of youth in the feare of God, in good maners, in knowledge and vnderstanding.</P>
<P>He also weieng with himselfe, that


<PB REF="9"/>
<HI>The labourer ought of right to haue his hire:</HI> And that, <HI>No man goeth to warre of his owne proper charge,</HI> besides other commodities which he thought méete &amp; necessarie, hath al∣lowed the Maister twentie pounds, and the Vsher tenne pounds, from time to time, as either place shall be supplied by succession, for their yeare∣ly stipends and perpetuall pensions. To continue the rehersall of his good déedes in <HI>Sutton</HI> aforesaide, note his tender and pitifull heart toward the poore, for whose sustentation, main∣tenance, and reliefe, he hath <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Almes hou∣ses built for the poore.</HI></NOTE> builded sixe almes houses for the impotent▪ and hath giuen sixe poundes to be yearely paied vnto them for their ne∣cessarie prouision. Moreouer, be∣sides this charitable déede, to kéepe still within the compasse of <HI>Kent,</HI> marke the singular loue which this Gentleman did beare vnto learning, for the furtherance whereof, and the more encouragement of poore scho∣lers, he hath giuen to the schoole of <HI>Maidstone,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Allowance for poore mens children to be kept at schoole.</HI></NOTE> ten pounds a yeare for


<PB REF="10"/>
euer, with this caueat or prouiso, that néed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mens children should be pre∣ferred to the enioieng of this singu∣lar benefite.</P>
<P>Here you sée, in the Countie of <HI>Kent,</HI> the monumentes which this woorthie Gentleman hath left be∣hinde him: and nowe be you iudges, whether these so godly and charita∣ble workes of Christianitie, deserue not a more permanent memoriall than penne and inke can performe. There remaineth behind a remem∣brance of other his notable actes, which as they are not to be omitted, so it is to be wished they were accor∣dingly followed.</P>
<P>That this Gentleman had not onely a regarde for the séede-plots of learning, to haue them watered with the springs of his bountie: but also a prouident eie, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cōmon∣welth remem∣bred.</HI></NOTE> a carefull heart for the profit of the Common-welth, the particulars following substanti∣ally do proue. For, séeing in his life time, the decay of sundrie trades, the ruine of diuerse occupations, and o∣ther


<PB REF="10"/>
inconueniences, which are like to growe to the vndoing of a multi∣tude, except by policie they be pre∣uented: of a méere affection (if I said fatherlie I were not controllable) he hath fréely giuen to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>A reliefe to poore Clo∣thiers in di∣uerse place:</HI></NOTE> the poore Clo∣thiers in <HI>Suffolke</HI>: to the poore Clo∣thiers of <HI>Bridgenorth</HI> in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> &amp; to the poore Clothiers at <HI>Ludlow</HI> in the saide Countie, thrée hundred pounds, to be paid by euen portions, to each seuerall towne of the saide Counties, one hundred poundes a péece, for their supportation &amp; main∣tenance at their worke and occu∣pation.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the well of his wel-doing not yet waxing drie, but yéel∣ding liquor of reliefe verie largely, hath watered other places. For, as the Countrie, so likewise the Citie, (this Citie <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>London the better by Master Lamb.</HI></NOTE> I meane of <HI>London</HI>) hath cause, yea iust cause with open month to magnifie the goodnesse of God, so mightily working in this praise worthie Esquire. The memo∣rable monuments, which shall liue


<PB REF="11"/>
when he is dead, and shall flourishe when he is rotten, are witnesses of the loue, which he being a Citizen bare vnto this Citie.</P>
<P>For, let vs begin with the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>A remem∣brance of Holborne Conduit foun¦ded and fini∣shed in Anno 1577.</HI></NOTE> Con∣duite which he of his owne costs, not requiring either collection or contri∣bution, founded of late in Holborne, not sparing expences so it might bée substantiall, not pinching for char∣ges so it might be durable and plen∣tifull, as they can testifie which sawe the séeking of the springs, the maner of making the trenches, the ordering of the pipes, lieng in length from the head, to the saide Conduite, more than two thousande yardes: and fi∣nally, the framing of euerie necessa∣rie appurtenance therevnto belong∣ing. Besides this, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The wast wa∣ter at the bridge runing at the Stan∣dart.</HI></NOTE> meanes is made, by a Standart with one cocke at Holborne bridge to conueie the wast, which doeth such seruice, the water thereof being both swéete, pleasant, and holsome, as neither riche nor poore can well misse. Which great worke as he aduisedly attempted, so


<PB REF="11"/>
he commendably finished, hauing disbursed thereabouts, of his owne costes and charges to the summe of fiftéene hundred poundes.</P>

<P>This Gentlemans distributions are so diuerse, and so many, that the rehearsall of them requireth a large discourse. It is well knowne, &amp; that canne the worshipfull companie of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>M.

Neither is this charitable déede laid a sléepe,


<PB REF="14"/>
but <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Perpetuall prouision for the poore.</HI></NOTE> continued euen to the worldes end, for the perpetuall succour of the poore and impotent, a legacie of sixe poundes, thirtéene shillings &amp; foure pence, allowed to that end, the be∣stowing whereof is in the handes of the said worshipfull societie of Sta∣tioners.</P>

<PB REF="14"/>
that we may sée in all his procée∣dings with what mercie he was mo∣ued, with what pitie pricked: &amp; final∣ly, in all respects how godlie giuen.</P>
<P>And here by the way it is to bée noted, that whereas it is recorded in the summarie of English Chroni∣cles, that he gaue to the hospitall, commonly called <HI>The Sauoy,</HI> foun∣ded by K.

For his bene∣ficence towards that hospitall was staid, not through any default in him, but because such agréements could not be concluded vpon, as he reaso∣nably required. Wherefore his con∣tribution that way ceased, sore (I dare say) against his godlie will. Thus much I was desired to speake touching that matter, to the intent that nothing but plaine truth might be reported, with the contrarie whereof he was not a litle offended.</P>
<P>And although offenders deserue rather to be punished than fauoured,

<P>

<PB REF="15"/>It were iniurie offered, to let slip vnremembred his mindfulnesse of poore maides marriages: &amp; how wil∣ling he was to helpe them, it appée∣reth by his good gifte of twentie pounds to be equally diuided among <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Marriage monie for poore maides.</HI></NOTE> fourtie suche in number by e∣quall portions of tenne shillings a péece: with this caueat, that these poore maides so to be married, should be of good name and fame: wherein marke how in all his bequests, wise∣dome is ioined as a yokfellowe with his bountie.</P>
<P>Lastly, and for conclusion, this discréete Gentleman, caried away with the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>His loue to∣wardes his seruants.</HI></NOTE> zeale of a good conscience, tendering the state of his seruantes, left them also at a reasonable good stay.
