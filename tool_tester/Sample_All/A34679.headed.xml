<HEAD>TO
THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE tongue of the just, or righteous</HI>
(saith <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. 10. 20.) <HI>is as
choise silver.</HI> The words that fall from the
tongue of such are very precious and profi∣table.
And truly such are the words that
dropt from the tongue and lips of this holy
and righteous man Mr. <HI>Cotton:</HI> As he himselfe had by his
owne blessed experience found the tongue of that righteous
man (D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sibbs)</HI> as choise silver, yea better then the choisest
gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI> by which the Lord was pleased to convey
heavenly and eternall treasure into his soule: Even so also
have many precious soules (some now above in glory, others
still here below) found the words that have distilled from
his tongue to be above much fine gold, and of more weight
and value then the greatest treasure of this whole world.
Divers that are yet alive, and do remain unto this present,
may &amp; can hear witnesse to the gracious words which pro∣ceeded
out of his mouth. But I shall crave leave to name on∣ly
one now amongst the Saints at rest, who was indeed one
of a thousand in his time and place, <HI>viz.</HI> that great and e∣minent
man, Dr. <HI>Preston,</HI> whose heart the Lord wrought
powerfully upon by the tongue of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> and that not
long after his heart had been seized upon by the tongue of
<PB REF="3"/>
that <HI>sweet Singer</HI> before mentioned. And because the sto∣ry
is so remarkable, I shall be willing to relate in briefe the
substance of what I had sometimes in private from the
tongue of this our <HI>Reverend Author</HI> himselfe. He being
according to his course to Preach before the <HI>University</HI> &amp;
Schollars in <HI>Cambridg,</HI> had a great conflict in himselfe a∣bout
the composing of his Sermon, <HI>viz.</HI> whether after the
plain &amp; profitable way, by raysing of <HI>Doctrines,</HI> with pro∣pounding
the <HI>Reasons</HI> and <HI>Uses</HI> of the same. Or after the
<HI>mode</HI> of the <HI>University</HI> at that time, which was to stuffe
and fill their Serm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns with as much Quotation and citing
of Authors as migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssibly be. On the one side 'twas sug∣gested
to him, that if he should not go the former way, he
should not be faithfull to the Lord in seeking his glory, but
his owne, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And on the other side, if he should not shew
his Learning, it would not onely be a disparagement unto
himselfe, but also unto the Colledg which had so lately cho∣sen
him out of another to be Fellow (for he was chosen <HI>Fel∣low</HI>
in <HI>Emanuel Colledg</HI> out of <HI>Trinity,</HI> where accor∣ding
to his yeare it fell out so as he could not be capable of a
<HI>Fellowship)</HI> What? is this that <HI>Cotton</HI> that was so fa∣mous,
and had such a name, for a great Schollar? what a
poore choise hath <HI>Emanuel Colledg</HI> made? Thus he was
tossed too and againe, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> in his thoughts (as I
thinke he sayd) about a fortnight, the Lord seeming to try
his sincerity at the first; but at length he came to a resolu∣tion
to deny himselfe, what ever the world might judge or
say of him: His Text (if I mistake not) being in 2 <HI>Cor. 2.
16. And who is sufficient for these things?</HI> Two or
three Doctrines (as it seems) he raised from the words. The
Schollars came generally with great expectation to heare a
more then ordinary learned Sermon from him that was so
famous throughout the <HI>University:</HI> and thereupon the Ma∣sters
<PB REF="3"/>
of Art at the beginning stood up, <HI>erectis auribus,</HI> a∣mongst
whom Mr. <HI>Preston</HI> was one; but soone perceiving
which way he went, which was so extreamely contrary to
their expectation, they sate them downe in great discontent,
pulling their hats over their eyes, thereby to expresse their
dislike of the Sermon: but before 'twas ended, something
dropt from the tongue of the Preacher, which the Lord made
unto Mr. <HI>Preston</HI> to be as choise silver indeed; whereby hee
was so affected, that he was made to stand up againe, and
change his posture, and attend to what was spoken, in ano∣ther
manner then he and the rest had done. These things
Mr. <HI>Preston</HI> afterward, getting to be acquainted with Mr.
<HI>Cotton</HI> (by coming to him under pretence of borrowing a
Booke of him, which he might have easily had elsewhere, &amp;
returning it againe) related particularly unto him.</P>
<P>Thus our Reverend <HI>Author</HI> by denying himselfe for the
Lord, had that cast in upon him <HI>(viz.</HI> the gaining of such
an eminent person to Christ) which was a thousand times
better then the airy applause of the world, in being accounted
a learned man: Yet neither did he loose that way, but had
the repute of that too (and not without cause) to his dying
day; notwithstanding his continuall care to avoyd all ap∣pearance
of affectation in the course of his Ministry, either
in regard of shewing Learning, or in the manner of expres∣sing
what he did deliver: whereby the power and effect of
his Preaching did appear to be wholly of God, being desirous
to speak to the understanding and capacity even of the mea∣nest,
and by manifestation of the Truth, to commend him∣selfe
to every mans conscience in the sight of God, A taste
whereof we have in these Sermons of his here published.</P>
<P>It were too great arrogance for mee to thinke to adde any
authority to these or any other of his precious labours by my
commendation of them, I might as well go about to adde to
<PB REF="4"/>
the light of the Sunne by my Candle: The very name of <HI>Cotton</HI> is e∣nough
to set an high price upon what ever hath that <HI>stamp:</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely
(being earnestly desired by the Christian brother, the publisher of this
<HI>Exposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion,</HI> who having the pen of a ready Writer, did take those
Notes from the mouth of the <HI>Preacher,</HI> to give my testimony to the
world that these were indeed the very Sermons of that holy Servant
of the Lord, whose name they bear) I shall willingly affirm and testifie
(having lived in that American wildernesse about 13. or 14. yeares
in the Towne next adjoyning to <HI>Boston,</HI> and so had thereby the hap∣py
priviledg of enjoying the benefit of the precious labours of Mr. <HI>Cot∣tons,</HI>
in his Lecture upon every fifth day in the week) I say I do here
declare and testifie unto the world that these Sermons upon the <HI>13<SUP>th.</SUP></HI>
Chapter of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> for the substance of them (giving al∣lowance
for such defects of the Amanvensis, which cannot but be ex∣pected
ordinarily, and yet I confesse are but very few in this Treatise)
were published by that faithfull servant of the Lord, Mr. <HI>John Cot∣ton,</HI>
about the 11. and 12. moneths (if I mistake not) of the year,
1639. and the first and second of the yeare 1640. upon his weekly
Lecture at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> where he went over the other
Chapters of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> as he did this thirteenth Chapter: and
indeed they that were acquainted with his Preaching, may easily dis∣cern
his very spirit in them all along.</P>
<P>Now that the holy spirit of the Lord may breath in these holy La∣bours
of his precious Servant, so as the Reader may experience the
truth of that divine sentence mentioned in the beginning, <HI>The tongue

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Revel. 13. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q><P>And I stood upon the sand of the Sea, and saw a Beast rise
up out of the Sea, having seven heads, and tenne horns,
and upon his horns ten Crowns, and upon his heads the
name of blasphemy.</P>
<P>And the Beast which I saw was like unto a Leopard, and his
feete were as the feete of a Beare, and his mouth as the
mouth of a Lyon: and the Dragon gave him his power,
and his seate, and great authority.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OU have heard from the last Chapter,
that when the Dragon (that is the
Devill, as he ruled the Roman Pagan
Empire) was cast downe out of
Heaven, (that is, dethroned from his
heavenly and Divine worship) he en∣deavoured
by all meanes to oppresse
the Church (that is, the woman) that
brought forth a Christian Emperour,
her and her seed. 1. By persecution. 2. By an inundation
of damnable Heresies, and barbarous Nations. 3. By open
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
War; which open war is exprest in the last verse of the former
Chapter, and here more fully described in this Chapter, a
whereof hath been now read.</P>
<P>The warre which is made against the Church, is here de∣scribed
to be managed by two beasts which the Devill raised
up; One he calls a Beast rising up out of the Sea, described
from the first verse to the end of the tenth. Another Beast hee
beheld coming up out of the Earth, from the 11<SUP>th.</SUP> verse to
the end of the Chapter.</P>
<P>Now the former of these Beasts is described by three argu∣ments.</P>
<P>1. By his Originall or Fountain from whence he springs;
he riseth up out of the Sea, which is amplified by the place of
<HI>Johns</HI> beholding him; <HI>I stood upon the sand of the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>2. He is described by his shape, here is his figure and resem∣blance:
For his head, he had seven heads, and they amplified
by honourable Ornaments (or rather dishonourable indeed,
but honourable in the beasts view) namely upon his heads
the name of blasphemy. 2. For his horns, he had ten horns,
and they are set forth by their Crowns which he had on his
horns; He had so many horns, so many Crowns, upon his
ten horns, ten Crowns. And as his shape is set forth by his
head and horns, so also by his resemblance, or likenesse; the
whole shape or bulk of the Beast is like a Leopard: The Leo∣pard
is of the femenine gender, and signifies the female of the
Panthers; the she Panther, spotted and ravenous, famous for
her speedy race, and yet of a good smell, by which she allures
other beasts to her, and as she hath occasion, doth devoure
them. And as his resemblance for his whole shape is like a
Leopard, so for his feet he is like a Bear: And for his mouth,
he hath the mouth of a Lyon: This is the second argument by
which he is described.</P>
<P>3. The third argument whereby he is described is his state,
and that amplified by three arguments. 1. By the efficient
cause. 2. By the variable change of it: And 3ly. by a wise
conclusion and observation. For the efficient cause of it, it is
said to be the Dragon; he gave him his power and authority.
For the variable change of it, it was, 1. Great, for it is here
called <HI>Power, and Seate, and great Authority.</HI> 2. One of his
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
heads was wounded; <HI>I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to
death.</HI> And thirdly, this wound was healed: this is the varia∣ble
change of it. 1. <HI>Great authority, honourable seate. 2. Woun∣ded
to death.</HI> And thirdly, <HI>healed of that deadly wound.</HI> And this
healing is amplified by five Effects, or Consequents. The first
was the worlds wondering: <HI>All the world wondered after the
Beast:</HI> The admiration was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this great change (so happily
atchieved as they thought) that he should recover that despe∣rate
danger. The second effect it wrought was, <HI>worship both
towards himselfe:</HI> And secondly, <HI>to the Dragon that gave
him power.</HI> The third effect of this healing was, <HI>liberty to blas∣pheme:
There was a mouth given him to speake great things &amp; blas∣phemies.</HI>
A fourth eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct was, <HI>Authority and Power</HI> (to do
what?) First, <HI>To continue forty two moneths,</HI> vers. 5. Second∣ly,
<HI>Power to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome them,</HI>
that was the fourth effect that followed his healing. The
fifth effect was amplitude, or largenesse of his Dominion:
<HI>Power was given him over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations,</HI> vers.
7. <HI>And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,</HI> vers. 8.
Which worshippers are described by their estrangement from
the number of Gods elect, whose names are not written in
the book of the life of the Lamb, and the Lamb set forth by
the eternall efficacy of his death, <HI>Slaine from the foundation of
the world.</HI> This is the second part of the description of the
Beast.</P>
<P>The third part is a conclusion, which contains a word of
Caution, and Consolation, or a word of Attention and Con∣solation
in the ninth and tenth verses. <HI>If any man have eares to
heare, let him heare;</HI> as if it were a matter worthy of observa∣tion
and diligent attention, and of exact understanding and
of consolation, in the tenth vers. <HI>He that leadeth into captivity
shall goe into captivity; he that killeth with the sword, must he killed
with the sword,</HI> &amp;c. This is the former Beast and his descrip∣tion.</P>
<P>The latter Beast is in the eleventh verse to the end: <HI>I beheld
another Beast coming up out of the earth,</HI> &amp;c. He is described by
his variety from the former beast: For his Original, he comes
not as the other Beast out of the Sea, but from the Earth:
And for his resemblance, he hath two horns like a Lamb,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
and he spake lik a Dragon. 2. He is described by his power,
as in the twelfth verse, but I will not now speak further of
him.</P>
<P>Now for the meaning of the words; It is that which the
holy Ghost calls us diligently to attend unto; <HI>He that hath
cares to heare, let him heare:</HI> If any man have an eare to under∣stand,
any apprehension of spirituall mysteries, any capacity
of matters of Religion, let him heare what manner of beast
the Devill stirred up, and set against the Church, to make
war against the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as if it were a matter that few would
understand but such as were of spirituall understanding, and
who will listen duly to a diligent observation of this descrip∣tion,
the matter whereof is weighty, and challengeth all our
intentions; and the more, because it is very rare to meet with
that which will satisfie a diligent Reader in the Exposition
hereof; But yet so much light God casts almost into the head
of every man that takes this Book in hand, especially in his
name and feare (according to his promise, <HI>Cap. 1. vers. 3)</HI>
that he adds some light more than hath been before brought
to his hand. Here you see are two Beasts, what is the former?
Many take it to be the Roman Empire, some take it to be the
Roman Pagan, some the Roman Christian Empire, but I
feare neither of them are right: It is not the Roman Papan
Empire, that is, take the Empire as it was before the conversi∣on
of <HI>Rome</HI> from Pagan to Christian, in the dayes of <HI>Tyberius,</HI>
and other persecuting Emperours, till <HI>Constantine:</HI> This Beast
was not the Roman Pagan Empire, I will give you a double
reason from the Text, the first is this.</P>
<P>1. The Pagan Empire was described as this Beast is, in
<HI>Rev. 12. 3. Behold a great red Dragon, having seven heads aud tenn
horns;</HI> but with this difference, <HI>The seven heads had seven
Crowns upon their heads:</HI> Now this Beast hath also seven heads,
which make it like the other, but these Crowns are not upon
the heads, but upon the horns, which maketh a great diffe∣rence,
an evident signe it is not the Roman Pagan Empire.</P>
<P>2. Againe, it is said of this Beast, that he continues 42.
moneths, and that is as long as the Church was in the wilder∣nesse;
for the Church continues in the wildernesse (as in <HI>chap.
12. 6.) a thousand two hundred and three-score dayes,</HI> which is
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
just 42. moneths: And so <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 2. It is said, <HI>The holy City
they shall tread under foot forty two moneths, all the time that the
two witnesses prophecyed in sackcloath, which was a thousand, two
hundred and threescore dayes.</HI> Now it is certain the Roman Pa∣gan
Empire did not continue as long as the Church was in
the wildernesse; for the Church went not into the wilderness
till the Pagan Empire ceased to be Pagan, and was translated
to Christian. Now the Roman Pagan Empire was removed
as by a great Earth-quake in <HI>Constantines</HI> time, and changed
from Pagan to Christian; it cannot therefore be the Roman
Pagan Empire, though many judicious Divines have gone
that way.</P>
<P>What then, may it be the Christian Empire? Many have
run that way, but neither is it so:</P>
<P>1. For it is said, <HI>this Dragon gave to him his power, his seate,
and great authority;</HI> now the seat of the Roman pagan Empire
indeed was <HI>Rome,</HI> but the Dragon did not give the Christian
Emperors <HI>Rome</HI> for their Seat, they would never sit there; but
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sate at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and prepared it to sit there, and
for that end <HI>Constantine</HI> named it after himselfe, <HI>Constantinople;</HI>
and if they had occasion to come into the Western parts of <HI>I∣taly,</HI>
they would sit at <HI>Ravenna,</HI> but at <HI>Rome</HI> they would not
come, unlesse it were Guest-wise.</P>
<P>2. Though it be true, as they say, the Roman Christian
Emperour had a deadly wound given him by barbarous Na∣tions,
yet when it was healed, the whole world did not ad∣mire
him: When <HI>Charles</HI> the great did heale the wound, yet
all the world did not wonder after him; It is true, <HI>France,</HI>
and <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> did admire him, but all the Eastern
parts did not submit to him, no nor <HI>England,</HI> nor <HI>Scotland,</HI>
nor <HI>Sweden,</HI> nor many other parts, they did not acknowledg
the Western Emperour, gave him neither civill nor religi∣ous
worship.</P>
<P>3. Neither doth this suffer it to be the Roman Christian
Empire, that it should be a note of perdition and reprobation
to honour the Roman Christian Emperours; for they that
have lived under the Roman Christian Emperour, have not
hazarded their salvation by that subjection: but here it is said
in the eighth verse, that they that honour this beast are such,
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<HI>whose names are not written in the booke of the life of the Lambe:</HI>
So that for these reasons I dare not so conceive this Beast to
he either Roman Pagan, or Roman Christian Empire.</P>
<P>What then, is it Antichrist? The third sort of Interpreters
run that way, and I would not exclude that wholly, but
yet neither dare I consent to rest in it; for when we open the
Oracles of God, we must not alwayes give the Comments
and Judgments of men for Scripture truths (though the men
be highly to be reverenced:) But in this place their Interpre∣tation
doth not satisfie me, I will give my reason; Antichrist
doth evidently appeare to be the other Beast that comes out
of the Earth, which is sayd to have <HI>two hornes like a Lamb,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>You may say, but Antichrist may be more wayes conside∣red
then one, as he is invested with temporall sovera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnty
and dominion, and so he may be the former beast: and as he
is invested with spiritual supremacy, and so he may be the lat∣ter
Beast; and indeed so, many Interpreters take it: but con∣sider
these descriptions.</P>
<P>1. They differ in number; <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>I saw a beast rise out
of the Sea;</HI> and then it is said in <HI>vers. 11. I beheld another beast;</HI>
it is not therefore the same.</P>
<P>2. <HI>They differ, as in number, so in their originall;</HI> the first
rose out of the sea, the second out of the earth.</P>
<P>3. <HI>They differ in their shape;</HI> The first beast had ten horns, the
second had but two horns like a Lamb.</P>
<P>4. They differ (and are apparantly distinguished in the ex∣ercise
of their power, for he exerciseth all the power of the
first Beast in his presence: And it is said also in the 12th. <HI>vers.
He causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first
beast: and he causeth them to make an image of the first beast, and he
had power to gve life to the image of the beast,</HI> &amp;c. So that the de∣scription
seems to be different; The second beast gives all his
power to the first, and yet honours himselfe too.</P>
<P>But that which most of all prevailes with me, and which
wholly captivates my Judgment to leane another way, is this,
That whereas they say the first beast was the Pope, as <HI>Dominus
in Temporalibus,</HI> as Lord in Temporalls; and the second beast
is the Pope, as he is <HI>Dominus in Spiritualibus.</HI> It is evident that
the Pope did not invest himselfe with temporall authority at
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
the first: But at first claimed spirituall and universall Episco∣pacy,
over-sight over all the Churches; he was first supream
head of the Church in his spirituall Jurisdiction, and did not
claime dominion in Temporalls till after his wound was hea∣led,
and then he took power to depose the Emperour of the
East, and translated his Empire from <HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> this
was his Dominion in earthly Monarchies which he took in
the latter place: And therefore I would rather say, that the
second beast is the Pope in both respects, as Lord and Sove∣raign,
high Priest in Spiritualls, and the high Priest also o∣ver
the Kings of the world in Temporalls: <HI>Hee had two hornes
like a Lamb,</HI> as the successor of <HI>Peter,</HI> and as if he had nothing
but from Christ, <HI>but he spake like a Dragon;</HI> When he had once
power by his Lamb-like horns, <HI>he then spake like a Dragon:</HI>
Therefore to speak that which I conceive to be the truth, I do
look at this first beast as indeed of like condition with the
Pope, and very nearly joyned to him. The Pope is one of the
heads and rulers of this Beast, but yet distinguished from the
beast it selfe, and is not the same with the beast.</P>
<P>This therefore (all things weighed according to the Text)
I conceive to be the first beast, the Roman Catholick visible
Church.</P>
<P>The seven heads and ten horns are a clear description of the
Roman State:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> Now this State here is neither the Pagan Ro∣man
Empire, nor the Christian Roman Empire, as hath been
shewed. And therefore it must needs be a third Roman State
distinct from the former, and succeeding in their place;
and what is that but the Roman Catholicke visible Church?
Of this Church the Pope is the head both as universall Bishop
over all Churches, and chiefly Lord in Temporalls, that had
both Swords, and obtained both Authorities, to be highest
supream head in Spirituals, as also supream head in Tempo∣ralls,
he was Soveraign Governour in all: And the Roman-catholick
visible Church, it comes just in the room of the Ro∣man
Empire: how was it described? The beast that had seven
heads, and ten horns, this comes in his room; the one go∣verns
all the world in his way, and the other all the Churches
another way: This is the Beast that the Dragon stirs up to
make War with the Saints. Now to appply this description
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
to this Church, for the better understanding of the Text.</P>
<P>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: <HI>I saw a beast rise out of the Sea:]</HI> You may aske what
is the Sea from whence this beast ariseth?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Sea is the collection of many waters; <HI>The ga∣thering
together of the waters called the Seas,</HI> Gen. 1. 9, 10. And
what are the waters? <HI>The waters which thou saw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st are People,
and Nations, and Languages, and Tongues,</HI> Rev. 17. 15. So then,
what is the beast here that ariseth out of the Sea? It is some
soveraign State that ariseth out of the connexion of many
Nations into one body, as you know the Roman Catholick
Church is not confined within the lifts of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI>
(though there the head is seated) but the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Sea;
it is well called a Sea in that respect, it is that which com∣prehends
all Nations, whether subject to the Eastern or We∣stern
Emperour; yea and other Nations that did not submit
themselves to the one or other, as if they did recollect them∣selves
as into one Sea, all banks are broken down in the Sea,
yet there is no distinction, but all is one Sea, one vast body:
And such is the Roman Catholick visible Church, all partiti∣ons
are here broken downe, all Churches make but one visi∣ble
Catholick Church.</P>
<P>And again, it is well said to arise out of the Sea, according
to the like description which <HI>Daniel</HI> makes of the foure Mo∣narchs,
in <HI>Dan. 7. Hee saw the foure windes of heaven strive upon
the great Sea, and foure Beasts came up from the sea; divers one from
another:</HI> From the multiplyed agitations of the Sea it came
to passe four great Monarchs did arise: Just thus, from the
tumult of particular Churches did this Beast arise; for when
they could not agree in the Churches, but some were of one
minde, some of another, it was the wisdom, as they thought,
of Christian Princes and Bishops (but it was but humane wis∣dome,
and was indeed from the Dragon, and not from
Christ) they thought it would be best to have but one church,
and the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> to be the head, though at first they di∣vided
them to four, but in the end they would have the Bishop
of <HI>Rome</HI> over all, that so they might have unity; for they
say unity springs from one head; and unlesse you have one
head, you cannot have unity: Therefore, from the particular
Church of a Congregation, they came to Diocesan, from Di∣ocesan,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
to Metropolitan; from Metropolitan to Patriarchal,
from Patriarchal to Cecumenical: And so it comes to pass, all
Churches must be gathered into one Sea, that is, one Catho∣lick
Church: For look what reason they had to set Bishops o∣ver
particular Churches: So having many Bishops, by the same
reason they must have some Metropolitan, and of many Me∣trapolitans,
foure or five Patriarchs, and of them one Chief,
that is the Pope, the Father of Fathers, he must be the grand
Governour of all: Therefore doth he rise out of the Sea, out
of the Sea of Tumult, and Sea of Contention: And if you
take Sea for corruption in Doctrine, and worship, and Go∣vernment
(as some good Interpreters do) it was from thence
also that this beast did arise; This beast did arise out of them
all; for had either pure Doctrine, or worship, or Discipline
been well looked unto, it had not been possible that such a
beast as the Catholick visible Roman Church should have bin
raised up.</P>
<P>It is further described to have <HI>seven heads, and ten horns:</HI>
The holy Ghost describes them so fully, that we need no fur∣ther
interpretation of them: He tells us in the 17. Chapter of
this book, the ninth and tenth verses; The seven heads are se∣ven
Mountaines on which the Woman sitteth, which are the
mountaines of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> it is built upon seven hills,
and the seven heads are also seven Kings, that is, seven Kingly
governments, soveraign governments: The first were Kings,
then Consuls, then Decemvins, then Dictators, then Tri∣bunes,
and then the <HI>Caesars:</HI> Five were fallen, that is, were
past in <HI>John's</HI> time, the sixth were then extant, and they were
the <HI>Caesars;</HI> the Pope he makes the seventh: Now the Pope
then is the seventh of these Heads, but the seventh head and
the beast are two distinct things, though he be one that rules
the beast, and hath a great influence in the guiding of it: Hee
was to receive a deadly wound, and after became an eighth
head, whereas he was but one of the seven: So that he is one
of the Heads, but there is difference between the head and the
beast, and the beast it selfe: And it is said, <HI>He exerciseth all the
power of the first Beast;</HI> that in conclusion, what the Pope de∣crees,
that stands: So that it is not a generall Councell that
determines any thing authentically without him, but he doth
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
all that the first beast doth; Hee would have the Catholick
Church honoured, but it is that himselfe may be honoured,
as the Lord of the Church: So therefore for the heads, these
are the seven Heads.</P>
<P>And for the Hornes, he tells you they are so many Kings,
which were not then risen to Soveraigne Power, but <HI>John</HI>
saw it in a Mystery afore hand; But when this Beast ariseth,
this <HI>Pontifex maximus,</HI> then they receive a Kingdome at the
same time, <HI>Chap.</HI> 17. 12. And the severall Kingdomes that
then were broken off from the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire (whereof <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
was one) they were so many severall Kings that all
gave their dominion to the Beast with one consent, and so
were his protectors, <HI>ver.</HI> 17. They were his Beauty and his
Strength, as the Hornes are to the Beast: So it is true, here
is a great Beast indeed, of a vast comprehension, here is an
universall visible Church, and he hath seven Heads; that is,
Seven Hilles, there he sits, and seven Governments; There
are seven Heads, both of the one and other, both Hills and
Governments, whereof five were fallen, and the sixth was
when <HI>John</HI> wrote: The seventh was to rise in their roomes,
and that is, <HI>He that hath two Hornes like a Lambe, and spake
like a Dragon, and doth exercise all the Power of the first Beast:</HI>
what power is in the Church, the <HI>Pope</HI> hath the ordering
thereof; And it is said here, that these Hornes had ten
Crowns, but so had not the Hornes of Pagan <HI>Rome.</HI> The
heads of Pagan <HI>Rome</HI> had soveraign Authority, and lived
like Princes, but so had not the <HI>Pope,</HI> they did not wear the
Crowns though they affect temporall dominion, but leave
the Crowns to the hornes, leave them to Crowned Kings
that give their power to him.</P>
<P><HI>Now upon these Heads are names of Blasphemy.]</HI> The old
High-Priest of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Synagogue he had a plate of pure
Gold, and there was graven upon it, <HI>holiness to the Lord,</HI> Exod.
28. 36, 37. This Beast hath not holinesse to the Lord, but
names of Blasphemy, the <HI>Pontifex maximus; His head is full of
names of Blasphemy;</HI> But the Pope exceeds all in this case, for
who ever took upon him as he to pardon Sinne? A name of
Blasphemy; To be Judge of Scriptures, a name of blas∣phemy:
Hee hath many other names of Blasphemy; he
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
will dispence with Oaths of allegeance, and all civil subjecti∣on;
he will dispence with marriages most incestuous, <HI>and doth
exalt himself above all that is called God,</HI> especially the Gods of
the Earth. His heads are full of names of Blasphemy (as we
shall come to speak God willing, in the 5 and 6 verses.)</P>
<P>Now it is said of this Beast, <HI>he is like a shee Leopard.]</HI> It is
in the 17 <HI>Chap.</HI> compared to a woman, to shew, that the
<HI>Roman</HI> catholick visible Church is as fitly resembled by a wo∣man
as a she Panther, &amp; such is this Beast: <HI>Can a Leopard change
his spots,</HI> Jer. 13. 23. Is it not a State full of spots, and the
spots are not the spots of Gods people, but spots of herisie,
and spots of Idolatry, &amp; spots of Tyranny, and great variety
of all spots of Blasphemy: To tell the spots of that Sea,
were ineeed to enter into a Sea of wickednesse, which that
Church abounds withall. <HI>Can a Leopard change his spots;</HI> This
church they make account cannot erre, &amp; so how should they
change? for they that cannot erre, to what purpose should
they change? yet of a very sweet &amp; fragrant smel, as they they
perfume their Temples with incense, and love to please ambi∣tious
minds, and to fill covetous hearts; they are sweet also,
and faire to voluptous spirits, with their Brothel houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But for the Leopard, Bear, and Lyon, I suppose there is
speciall reference to them all, In <HI>Dan.</HI> 7. 4, 5, 6. where he
resembles the Monarch of <HI>Babell</HI> to a Lyon, and the Monarch
of <HI>Persia</HI> to a Bear, and the Monarch of <HI>Greece</HI> to a Leopard:
There the Leopard is the last of the three, here it is the first, to
shew a direct contrary course that this Beast takes in his rise
to the old Monarchies. Of the great Monarchies, the first
was a Lyon, full of magnanimity, the next was a Beare, full
of cruelty, a Bear that devoures mucb flesh, and the Leopard,
the spotted Beast comes after, cruell as the former: Now
here the Leopard is first, the whole shape is sweet and savou∣ry;
other beasts would follow him by the smell; and so
this church seemes in the wole bulk sweet and savory to in∣veagle
all unstable Soules; But where he gets hold, he layes
his paw like a Beare, presseth hard, and holds fast, and will
not let goe; Just like the <HI>Persian</HI> State, they hold fast; Never
did any of the States last so long as the Papall State; The
<HI>Assyrian</HI> lasted, long but yet did not continue above a thousand
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
years; but this is to continue 1260. dayes, that is, so ma∣ny
yeares, in a great deal of Power and Authority; And
therefore as by subtilty he drawes others to him, so them hee
holds fast, that it is marvellous hard to root out where he
hath got hold; you may cut off his head, as it is in <HI>England;</HI>
but it is a wonder to see what paines there is to have the Go∣vernment
of Christ brought in, and of the Beast cast out:
they will make so many Statutes in Parliament, that you can
have no wills confirmed, nor Marriages made, but by them,
nor no Parliments Acts passe but through their hands; you
have so many matters in the State depending on them, that
one would think it impossible ever to root them out: you
may take off the Beast his head; you may thrust the Leopard
out at windows, but he will take hold with his feet, that you
shall have much ado to root him out: The great profits, and
great preferments they sink deep in the hearts of carnall men.</P>
<P><HI>And he hath a mouth like a Lyon.]</HI> How did the Lyon of <HI>Ba∣bell</HI>
speak presumptuously; <HI>what God is able to deliver you out of
the firey furnace?</HI> &amp;c. and he commands all that will not
worship his Image should be cast into the fyery furnace: Just
such is the mouth of this Beast; who so will not worship
the Image of this Beast shall be killed, in the 15 <HI>v.</HI> of this chap∣ter.
So you see this is the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick visible church.</P>
<P><HI>And the Dragon gave this church power.]</HI> All that the Roman
Emperor could doe before, that doth the Catholick church;
that w<SUP>ch</SUP> the old Roman Emperor did by force of arms, that
doth the Roman Church by the power of Religion and con∣science:
<HI>The Dragon gave him his power, and Seat, and great Au∣thority.</HI>
And Satan will worke by the power of conscience,
making them believe that all must be subject to them: <HI>He
gave them his Seat:</HI> what was the Seat of the old Roman Em∣peror?
It was <HI>Rome,</HI> Satan gave that to the Beast; There
is his Seat, and great Authority, insomuch that all the world
were deeply taken with the reverence they owe as to the Im∣perial
mother City; So to this soveraign mother Church, &amp;
their holy Father the Pope that was the head of that Church:
This is the plain description of this first Beast. I canot pro∣ceed
now to open the wounding of one of the heads of this
Beast, nor of the healing of that wound, nor of his warre
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
against the Saints: I am the longer in this, because the more
clearly these things are opened, the more fully will the coun∣sell
of the holy Ghost appear in the sequell. <HI>If any man have
eares to heare, let him heare:</HI> doe not think that these things
concern Students onely, and Scollars; But what is this to
common christians? <HI>He that hath an eare, let him heare what
the holy Ghost saith:</HI> It is the same charge which he gave con∣cerning
the Epistles which were common to all churches; <HI>If
any man have an eare let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
Churches:</HI> Those generall doctrines necessary for all Christi∣ans
to understand, the same charge is laid upon all to heare
what is spoken concerning this beast; If thou understandest
Religion, if thou wouldst be, or art a member of a Church of
Christ know this point; <HI>If any man have an ear let him hear this.</HI></P>
<P>But you will say to me▪ shall we make it an Article of our Creed to
believe the Catholick Church; and shall we now make it an Article
of Faith to beleive it to be a Monster? I believe the holy Catholick
Church, and shall we make it a Beast?</P>
<P>To this I answer; The holy Catholick Church we make
it an Article of our Creed, that is, a company of the Godly
called out of the world; we look at them all as those for
whom Christ shed his bloud: But we must not look at this
as a visible Catholick Church, much lesse the Roman Church
as the Catholick Church: we believe the Catholick Church
is invisible; we believe no visible Church, but Congregati∣ons;
and therefore if you come to heare of a Roman Ca∣tholick
visible Church, whereof the Pope is the head, and
who takes upon him all this Soveraignty and power here
described, we look at such a body as a great B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast: Commu∣nion
of Saints wee acknowledge, and that all the Churches
of Christ have one and the same power amongst them: The
Church of this Congregation hath power within it selfe e∣quall
to what others have, and none have power one over a∣nother:
None of us are like Leopards to other beasts, per∣fumed
to draw other beasts after us, and then like Beares to
clasp them in to be subject to this Church, &amp; then speak like
Lyons, that all shall be subject to our commands: This is a
Beast, and this is no Catholick Church; This is a Catholick
Church of the Devill, but not of Christ. Thus have you the
two first verses opened unto you.</P>

Come we now to gather one briefe note from the words:</P>
<P>The visible Catholicke Roman Church is in the esteem of the holy
Ghost a monstrous Beast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct.</NOTE> <HI>that is the note.</HI></P>
<P>That it is the beast here described, you have heard it ope∣ned:
Some Roman State it must be, and you have heard it
can neither be <HI>Rome</HI>-Pagan, nor <HI>Rome</HI>-Christian: It must
therefore be the Roman Church; for it is described by seven
heads, and ten horns, which are the Arms of <HI>Rome,</HI> as they
are described in the <HI>Revelations.</HI></P>
<P>That it is in the eyes of the holy Ghost a monstrous beast is
here evident; for imagine a beast set before you with seven
heads, and ten horns, would it not seem a monster, and un∣naturall?
that it should look like a Leopard, all sported, <HI>and
feete like a Beare?</HI> and look at his mouth, <HI>and that's like a Ly∣on,</HI>
is not this a monster? to say nothing of his blasphemies,
which makes him a wicked beast: but look at his visage which
is here resembled, and what is here deciphered but a mon∣ster?
It holds forth his description in other places, in <HI>Chap.
16. 13. There came forth three unclean spirits out of the mouth of
the Dragon</HI> (that is the Devill) <HI>and out of the mouth of the Beast,
&amp; out of the mouth of the false Prophet.</HI> And you shall also read,
that the beast was taken, and with him the false Prophet;
these were two still, they could not be made one, <HI>Rev. 19.
20. And they were both cast alive into a lake of fire burning with
brimstone,</HI> both the the first beast and the latter beast, the beast
and the false Prophet: <HI>He like a Lamb comes in sheeps cloathing,
but inwardly is a ravening wolfe.</HI></P>
<P>Now why is it such a monstrous beast?</P>
<P>If God had made such a kinde of creature; a Leopard is no mon∣ster,
nor a Beare, nor a Lyon: But if you make a Beast of all these,
that will be a monster, that is contrary to the course of nature, cleare
besides the ordinary course of naturall generation, that makes a thing
monstrous, this then is the reason of the point.</P>
<P>A beast ingendred against the course of nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason.</NOTE> that is a
monster, especially if there be so many uncouth shapes of
which it is composed: And it is not so with this universall
Catholick visible Church? Doe but consider what kinde of
Church the Lord instituted, the Church of a particular con∣gregation:
<HI>If thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
fault between thee and him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>If he will not hear thee, take with
thee one or two more,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>If he shall neglect to heare them, tell it to
the Church,</HI> Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. What, the Catholick vi∣sible
Church, when will that meet think you? And is it ever
to be expected that when they do meet, that every brother of
this countrey and other countreys must go to <HI>Rome,</HI> and tell
the Trespasses of his brother against him, and send for those
that have offended him, and thus and thus plead with them?
And when do you think that a Catholick Church will heale
all offences between brethren? Will not this be a monstrous
beast when the Catholick Church must heare and remove of∣fences?
That Church which Christ hath ordained will heare
the offences of brethren, and a brother hath liberty to tell
his offence to the Church, and at length the matter will be
brought to an issue, when they they have two witnesses, then
the Church sees what is to be done: Now to have a Catho∣lick
visible Church, what a monstrous disturbance will that
be to the free dispensation of the government of Christ? and
yet the rulers thereof will be the only visible Church-govern∣nours
of the world.</P>
<P>Again, you read in 1 <HI>Cor. 14. 23. When the whole Church</HI> (saith
the Apostle) <HI>shall come together into one place,</HI> &amp;c. The Church
therefore which the Apostles instituted may be gathered into
one place, <HI>that all may heare, and all may be edefied:</HI> Why, is it
possible that all Churches should be gathered into one place?
or should all heare if they were gathered? or will they be ever
so gathered? what a wondrous beast will this be?</P>
<P>Againe, whereas Christ hath said, <HI>his Kingdome is not of this
world,</HI> and hath appointed to his Disciples, <HI>that they should not
be Lords over Gods heritage,</HI> 1 Pet. 5. 3. and in <HI>Mat.</HI> 20. from 23.
to 29. <HI>It shall not be so among you: But whosoever will be great a∣mong
you, let him be your Minister: and let every soule be subject to
the authority of the higher powers.</HI> Well now, if there must be a
Catholick Church, and an Officer that shall rule all Nations,
and that in so many Nations with Spirituall and Temporall
Dominion, carry all before him, will it not be a Monster?
What a disproportion is this to the Churches of Christ, and to
the Officers thereof? Not to speak of their other monstrous
usurpations of the head of this Church, but take the body as
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
it is, how they speak like a Lyon, and hold fast when they get
like a Beare, and are spotted like a Leopard, that they are
nothing but hotch-potch, and mingle-mangle: <HI>If any man
have understanding, let him understand</HI> what kind of Church this
is that is thus deciphered, and described, this visible Catho∣lick
Church. For the Use.</P>
<P>It may first teach us the great and just reason which all Pro∣testant
Churches have to with-draw themselves from the fel∣lowship
of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> from the Catholick visible
Roman Church, though they look at those that submit not
to them as Schismaticks and Hereticks; I pray you consider
would they have us submit to this great beast? would they
have the Lambs of Christ (for such are the Churches of
Christ) to submit to a Lyon, Beare, or Leopard? Hath any
Lamb in the world (much lesse a Lamb of Christ) so many
Heads and Horns, and such spots, and such fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and such a
mouth? Therefore I pray you consider, it is not time for
the Lambs of Christ, and for all the Churches of Christ to flye
off from this Monster, and to abandon them utterly, as ha∣ving
no part nor portion with such a beast as this?</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> let this be another Use; it may teach us how
Christian Protestant Churches wrong themselves that leave
any footsteps of this government in their Churches: For that
is part of the image of the beast; for the second beast, when he
was advanced, he would have an image of the first beast, they
must have Provinciall and Diocesan Churches, and National
Churches, and carry I know not how many hundred con∣gregations
into one Nationall Church, and there must be
some Diocesan and Metrapolitan church, and the rest must be
inferiour to that: Though this be not so great a monster as
the great Beast, yet it is an image of this beast; can any bro∣ther
tell his offence to such a church? And will you have him
stay till the whole National church meets? Or will you have
him stay till the Diocesan church meets, and carry his offen∣ces
to the Visitation? Do you think they will right his cause
then? Are a few such kind of men, the Chancellor, and Regi∣ster,
and Surrogate, and Apparitor, do you think the church
that our Saviour bids us tell? Are these they that are gathe∣red
together, <HI>that all may heare, and all may be edefied? Do these
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
serve the Lord Jesus, and not their owne bellies?</HI> I say therefore,
you may see what great reason men have to with-draw from
subjection in spirituall matters to the Image of this great
beast that in some measure represent the same state as they.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> let it be a seasonable advertisement to all (if I
were to speak to Princes) to all Princes, but however to all
Magistrates, how to make use of their Authority to be as Pro∣tectors
of the Church, &amp; in respect of their spirituall estate, as
children of the church, but not to give the horns to the
church (though horns be for beauty and strength:) you see
it makes the Church a monster, and it is to make a beast of
the Church: And so if you should make Church-Officers Ju∣stices
of Peace, or Councellors, or prostitute your own Go∣vernment
to them, that if the Church condemn any, then
you must do so too (as heretofore if a man were condemned
by the Church, and by them delivered to the secular power,
then burn him presently;) this puts your Horns upon the
Churches head, unto monstrous deformity: And therefore it
is necessary for Magistrates to keep their power in their owne
hands, and not to take things <HI>Ipso facto,</HI> from the Church,
but to consider what is done, and then they are to confirm
what the Church doth according to God; Here are ten horns,
and these are tenne Kings by the holy Ghosts interpretation,
and they adde to the monstrousnesse of this Beast, by giving
their power thereto. Why, doth this mishape a Christian
Church, for Magistrates to submit their crownes to the
Church? No, God forbid, it is an honour and happinesse to
them, when Kings are nursing Fathers to the church, and
bow down their faces to the earth, <HI>Isa.</HI> 49. 23. But why then
doth he put it as a part of the mishapen state of the Church,
that it had <HI>tenne hornes,</HI> to wit, because these Kings did give
their strength and power to the Beast, that the Beast did act
these Horns acording to the power of his lust, as <HI>Chap.</HI> 17. v.
17. as it was truly accomplished in all the Kings of <HI>Europe,</HI>
that did submit all their Scepters, and Thrones, and Crowns,
and Dignities to the Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> That if hee command
this or that, there must be room for him, what ever becomes
of Princes, Laws, and Endeavours, and all acts and enterpri∣ses
of War, or Peace: He had their horns on his head, he
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
might push with them as he would: This made the Church a
monster, when soveraign power was obnoxious to the Bi∣shop
of <HI>Rome,</HI> when without Excomunication, whether a
cause were of God or no, Magistrates proceeded, if the Church
had censured: As a Beast that hath horns on his head, as hee
turns, so must the power of his horns be set and put forth:
If therefore the Catholick Church, or any Officer of it shall
condemn a man as an Heretick, and then deliver him to the
secular power, they never dispute the cause, but take it for
granted; If their holy mother Church condemn him, the Se∣cular
Power must push and crush him to the very Earth, and
trample him under foot, and rend his bowels from his body,
if he once be delivered to them. Now this makes the Church
a beast, that hath this power over the Princes of the Earth,
that look what is their lust, or their ignorance, or their er∣rour,
and the contrary adjudged by them to be Heresie, that
the Secular power must mayntain the one, and condemn the
other. It is a comfortable thing for Churches to be strength∣ned
and protected by civill Magistrates: But if they captivate
their power to the Church, that what Church Rulers call
for not according to the Word, but their Lusts, that the civill
Magistrate must confirm, that makes the Church a Beast: And
<HI>therefore be wise now O ye Kings, be instructed O ye Judges of the
earth, serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling,</HI> &amp;c.
Psal. 2. 11, 12. Kisse the Lord Jesus, submit to him, and in
him to the church; Lick the dust off the feet of the church,
dispensing his counsell and will: But when by implicite obe∣dience
the Common-wealth must he prostitute to the Beast, it
makes the Beast more monstrous then it is: The authority of
Princes in that kind makes such churches to be very beastly
and ugly monsters.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> let it be of this use to raise up our hearts in holy
thankfulnesse to God, that hath delivered us from this Mon∣ster,
both our Fathers from this great beast, and our selves
from the remnants of the Image of this beast, from all Dioce∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>san
and National Churches, and from Metropollitan &amp; Ca∣tholick
visible Churches that are Images of this great beast.
You know how much the civill Laws of Christian Kingdoms
doe strengthen Ecclesiasticall power, that if once a Church
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
excōmunicat a man, you know the power of the Law, if once
this or that court excomunicate a man, though it be but for
not paying fees, when it may be he hath no money, or thinks
it not lawfull to maintain them by his purse: yea when he is
excommunicate, it may be for going to hear a Sermon in a∣nother
place, when he hath nothing but reading at home; or
if a man fast with his neighbors in his house, then what pow∣er
there is out of such a Court, civill Courts of Justice con∣firme,
there comes a Significavit, that if he shall live so ex∣communicate:
and if he continue and stay out a certain time,
then the Common-wealth apprehends him, and never con∣siders
whether the cause be just or unjust: I confesse there is
a liberty to traverse such a cause; but if a man want money,
or want friends, he may be taken and carryed to Prison, and
there he may lie and rott for any of these mishapen Clergy
men: But I say it is a great liberty to be freed from this
great beast, that he hath no finger amongst us, we are out of
his paw, and out of his smell: It was a matter in question
here not long agoe, whether the Court should not take a
course to punish such persons as stood excommunicate out
of the Church, if they should stand long excommunicate,
but it was a good providence of God that such a thing was
prevented: Let not any Court, <HI>Ipso facto,</HI> take things
from the Church; If such a Law were made (the Fathers
live not for ever;) and if such a Law were once established,
that a Church-member standing so long excommunicated,
the Common-wealth then should proceed against him; were
this established, it would make a Beast of the Church; we
are subject to erre, and our posterity that comes after us may
erre (it may be feared) worse; It is therefore a mercy to be
freed from the beast, from the paw of the Bear, and the mouth
of the Lyon: It is such a mercy that they that got the victory
over these, they stood praising God, as <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. 1, 2. The
Lambs company that stood on mount Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on they stand and
praise, and wonder at the gracious hand of God in this case;
And therefore we should in the fear of God be unfeignedly
thankfull to God for our present liberties, and withall that
we may be so, <HI>Let him that hath an eare to heare, heare;</HI> If you
be of Spirituall discerning, and know what these mercies
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
mean, you will be really thankfull; Therefore shew this
thankfullnesse, not onely in searching the true meaning of
the Text, and the true nature of this beast described in it, but
also in standing fast in these great liberties wherewith Christ
hath made us free, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 1.</P>
<P>You shall have many poore creatures that came hither to
this Country, and will be ready to go back againe, they
looke at things as mean and poor here; believe it, such a
man hath not an eare, nor an eye open, he knows not whe∣ther
he goes: <HI>Hagar,</HI> Sarahs maid, whether goest thou? saith
the Lord to her: And so may I say to such, whether will you
goe? will you be gone back againe to <HI>Egypt</HI> (God forbid
I should count all our Native Country as <HI>Egypt)</HI> but if you
goe thither, you will have much adoe to escape the paw of
of the Bear: If you be once incorporated into any of their
Parishes, you will finde such beastly work in Church Go∣vernment
(I may speak it without wrong to any, but that
I may bear witnesse against what is corrupt) that you will
then finde the blessing of those that enjoy liberty and piety
together, you must worship the beast or the Image of the
beast; A Diocesan, or Nationall Church, it is but an Image
of the great beast, it is a plain pattern of the same; and you
will finde the body of the Church rent from you, or you
will be rent from the body, if you shall walk roundly and
sincerely in the ways of God; you will finde sad work to
have your own officers or others to rise up against you: but
we have here cause to praise God for our present liberties,
and therefore you are to be wary what you doe. If this be
cause of thankfulnesse, turn not againe to that from which
the Lord by his stretched out arme hath delivered you: And
this let me say further, as it may provoke us to thankfulness,
so to forego all the Profits of this life, rather then to be
drawn to subjection to such a Spirituall Government; you
see what the holy Ghost counts it, seven heads, ten horns,
heads full of names of blasphemy, horns crowned, and here
is a beast like a Leopard, with feet like a Bear; that all the
Government of it looks like rapine and robbery, catching
and snatching, rending and tearing, this is the sum and
scope of it: And therefore be not deceived; if men shall
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
tender you faire termes that may smell sweet, you shall
have liberty in this and that, and protection of a good State,
but it is but the smell of a Leopard; when you have yielded
to such Conditions as may be tendred, you will finde such
strong hold got of you, that you will never get out: And
then you shall finde what ever Conditions are put in at first,
the last Edition will be <HI>a mouth like a Lyon:</HI> They will bring
you in with subtilty, like a Leopard, lay fast hold upon you
like a Beare; and before they have done, there will be <HI>a mouth
like a Lyon:</HI> And therefore as we are to be thankfull, so we are
to be faithfull to God, that hath purchased these great liber∣ties
for us, and be no more willing to be intangled with your
former state, than you would be willing to fall into the
mouth of a Lyon, or come under the paw a Beare.</P>
<P><HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> But you will say, what is this to me, I am but a private Chri∣stian?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Private Christians must not live alwayes in a pri∣vate
State, for that darkens a mans estate, if he knows not
the order of Gods house, nor addresseth himselfe to it. It is
true, if a man either were in the Temple, or looked towards
it, his prayers were accepted; but if a man have no minde to
know the orders of Gods house, his ignorance of Church
matters will darken his own spirituall estate: And therefore
whosoever thou be, Sonne or Daughter; <HI>If any have eares to
heare, let them listen to what is here spoken,</HI> that so by the bles∣sing
of God, you may be the more able to finde the free
passage of joy, and the power of godlinesse in all your pri∣vate

<BIBL>Revel. 13. the latter part of the 2<SUP>d</SUP>. verse.</BIBL>
<Q>And the Dragon gave him his power, and his seate, and
great authority.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe next note is this;</P>
<P>That the Dragon (that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct. 2.</NOTE> Satan) as he had the government of the
Pagan Roman Empire: so being cast out of it, he gave (or procured
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
and obtained) to the Roman Catholicke visible Church his power,
and seate (or Throne) and great authority.</P>
<P><HI>For so it is plainly here said,</HI> That the Dragon gave to the
Beast his power, and his seate, and great authority.</P>
<P>The Dragon, who is that? You heard, <HI>the Dragon is the old
Serpent called the Devill, and Satan:</HI> but the Dragon considered,
as he sometimes swayed the Roman Pagan Empire, as in <HI>Rev.
12. 3. There appeared a wonder in heaven, a great red Dragon,
having seven heads and ten horns;</HI> they are interpreted by the
Angell, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 3, 4. 9, 10. 12. 18. The seven heads to be
the seven hills of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the ten horns, so many Kings
that arose with the last head of the Beast; Therefore he means
the Dragon, as he sometimes swayed the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
so the Seate and State of the Pagan Roman Empire: And be∣ing
now cast out, and seeing he cannot maintaine his State
and divine honour, as before, to whom doth he give his ho∣nour?
what, to the Roman Christian Empire? No, his rage
is against them, and the Church amongst them: Neither did
he give them his Seate; they sate not at <HI>Rome,</HI> but at <HI>Con∣stantinople:</HI>
Neither can he easily fasten upon the civill State
such delusions, as to cause the Christian Emperours to take
to themselves divine honour, though the Pagan Roman Em∣perours
had so done: But now hee doth choose to fasten them
upon the Ecclesiasticall State, and thinks he shall more pre∣vaile
with Church-men (as I may speak) to drinke in an i∣nundation
of Heresies in Doctrine, and Tyranny in Govern∣ment,
and Superstition in Worship, he thinks he shall soo∣ner
prevaile with the Ecclesiasticall State, then with the Ci∣vill;
Therefore upon this Beast (which can neither be Ro∣man,
Heathen, nor Christian Empire, but the Roman
Church) doth he fasten his power, and seate, and great au∣thority.</P>
<P><HI>His power.]</HI> A three-fold power did the Devill fasten upon
the Roman Catholick visible Church.</P>
<P>1. The power of signes and lying wonders: <HI>Hee gave him
great power to worke great wonders,</HI> 2 Thes. 2. 9. Of which there
is more spoken in the sequell of the Chapter, where some of
his miracles are mentioned.</P>
<P>2. He gave him the power of effectuall Sophistry, or (as
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
the Scripture calls it, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2 9, 10.) of deceit, of unrigh∣teousnesse;
partly in the Schoolmen, and partly in their Vo∣taries,
or Cloyster-men, and partly in their Canonists. By
the efficacy of Sophistry in School-men, he corrupted all Do∣ctrine.
By the deceit of the Cloyster-men, the Monkes, he
corrupted all their devotion and worship: And by the policy
of their Canonists, he corrupted all Church-government;
and this was carryed with such efficacy of deceit, that those
School-Divines were accounted the most profound, and the
Monks most devout, and the Canonists most judicious, and
exquisite Polititians: Now these three did mightily deceive
the Christian world by their power, and all this power Satan
gave to this Beast.</P>
<P>3. He gave him the power also of making war; for in <HI>vers.
7. It was given him to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome
them;</HI> putting into the hearts of christian Kings to give their
power to the Beast, and to wage all their Battels at their own
charges whiles he sate still; this was the power which was gi∣ven
him by the Dragon.</P>
<P>And for his seate, what was it? <HI>It was the City of</HI> Rome
<HI>which ruled over the Kings of the earth,</HI> Rev. 17. 18. And for
that end he would not suffer <HI>Constantine,</HI> nor other Emperors
to dwell at <HI>Rome:</HI> If they were in <HI>Italy,</HI> they should dwell at
<HI>Ravenna:</HI> So that the Dragon granted his owne Seate or
Throne, not to the Emperors, for they never cared for it,
but he reserved it for this Beast, to be the center and chief Seate
of the Roman Catholick Church.</P>
<P>And he gave him also great authority, transcendently great in∣deed.</P>
<P>Great Authority.</P>
<P>1. Over the Scriptures.</P>
<P>2. Over the consciences of men.</P>
<P>3. Over the treasury of the church: Over Church-Ru∣lers,
and Churches, over the merits of Christ, over King∣doms
and Common-wealths, over Purgatory, and for
mitigating the paines of Hell: All this he gave to the Ro∣man
Catholick visible Church.</P>
<P>1. He gave him power over the Scriptures.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As Judg of them. The Church is the Judg of contro∣versies,
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>
and the head of that Church is the Judg of all places
of Scripture, by his authority it is authenticall; This the Ca∣tholick
Church doth challenge.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He doth prefer the vulgar Latine before the Originall
Scripture, a transcendant power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It is in his power to make <HI>Apocrypha</HI> Scripture, to
be of like power with the canonicall Scripture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It is his power and authority that gives unwritten
Traditions like power with the canonicall Scripture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He takes upon him to be the infallible Interpreter,
and Judge of the meaning of Scripture, and that is Blas∣phemy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He takes upon him power to dispence with Scrip∣ture.
Hee hath power to dispence with the morall Law of
God in point of Marriages, even in incestuous Marriages, this
is a power beyond Scripture.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>2. He hath great authority over the consciences of men,
making Laws and Canons to bind the conscience, and relea∣sing
and loosing them from the power of Gods Lawes, either
in point of Marriage, or in point of Oaths and Covenants, or
in point of naturall relation: He can dispence with children
in respect of duty to Parents, if they come into Monasteries,
and with duty which Subjects owe to Magistrates.</P>
<P>3. They have power over the Church Treasury, by which
they meane the supererogation of the merits of Christ, and of
the Saints: They say Christ merited for a thousand worlds:
and because he saved but a few, it is free for the Pope to take
the surplussage of merit; He can take them and apply them
by Indulgences, for the pardoning of them that pay well for
them. And thus they who despise Gods imputation of the
righteousnesse of Christ for justification, they take upon them
to impute it to themselves, and to this and that notorious
wicked man.</P>
<P>4. They have power over Kingdomes and Common-wealths,
to depose Kings, and to dispose of their Kingdoms
as they please, and to absolve Subjects from all Allegiance
to civill power, and for that end to nullifie their Oath, for
that end you know what the Pope sent to <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth:
Christ (say they) gave this power to <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> to the
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
Pope, and to that end abuse. <HI>Jer. 1. 10. See, I have this day
set thee over the Nations, to root cut and pull downe, and to destroy,
and to throw downe, to build, and to plant.</HI></P>
<P>5. They have power over the estate of the life to come.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Over Heaven. Hee claimes transcendent power in
that, and doth abuse that place in</HI> Mat. 16. 19. To thee
will I give the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, that whatsoever
thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; whatsoever thou
shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven: <HI>Therefore he can
open the gates of Heaven to them that are dead.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They have power over Purgatory; Upon so much
done and given, they can help them out of Purgatory: They
make account the torments of Purgatory are equall to the
paines of Hell; but that Hell is for ever, and Purgatory but
till the last Judgment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They have power over Hell: they have not absolute
power to deliver out of Hell (only <HI>Gregory</HI> is said to have
delivered <HI>Trajans</HI> soul out of Hell;) but though they can∣not
deliver out of Hell, yet they can ease the torment. The
witnesses of this will hardly owne it, but it is the judgment
of the most devout to that Sea.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>So that he gave to the Catholick church his power of signs
and lying wonders, of all kinds of efficacy of delusions, and
power of making Warre, and he gave him great authority o∣ver
the Scriptures, over mens Consciences, over the treasures
of the Church, over Kingdomes, and Princes, and Powers
of the world to come, and over Purgatory and Hell: And
therefore consider, if this be not a vast power, which is here
given, and acknowledged to be given by himselfe to the Ca∣tholick
visible Roman Church: You must not wonder that
the Catholick Church did not claim all this at first, but came
to this by degrees, and more faster grew to this, especially at
that time when this second Beast (that received in spiritualls
his power, speaking like a Dragon) had got all this transcen∣dant
power. In the mean time, from the very first you shal find
this power in the representative Catholick Church; They
quartered them into severall Jurisdictions, into Bishopricks;
and when they had done that, they rested not till they had
set one over the rest, and that was this of <HI>Rome:</HI> And besides,
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
this was devillish Authority to make Laws to bind all Chri∣stian
Congregations, to take their Government from them.
3ly. In every Councell they devised some new Doctrine, and
some new form of worship and Government, which was the
seed out of which this transcendant power was hatched.</P>
<P>For the reason of the point, you may aske how hee should
give all this power which he never had himself, how he should
give that which never was his to a Beast, so as to carry all
things with that transcendant power, for divine power he
had not himself, he was cast out from it, how then could hee
give this to any State in the world?</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> from Gods divine Justice, and heavy Judgment upon
the unthankfull world: That look, as God in former times
did give up the Roman Pagan world to be ruled by Satan as
the god of it (and therefore he is called in 2 <HI>Cor. 4. 4. the God
of the world)</HI> So now God gave up the Roman Christian
world, as he did the Pagan world before; the Scripture tells
us so, 2 <HI>Thes. 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Because they received not the
love of the truth that they might be saved, he gave them up to effica∣cy
of delusions to believe lies: That they all might be damned who be∣lieve
not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousnesse.</HI> They lo∣ved
not the simplicity of the Apostles Institutions, concer∣ning
Churches, and Laws, and Doctrine, and Apostolick go∣vernment,
but did affect high preferments, and setled en∣dowments,
and carnall excellency. Now the Lord therefore
gives Satan wonderfull power, that as of old he was once the
God of Pagan <HI>Rome,</HI> so now in the Church he gives them
Church-power; that what he could not retaine in his owne
hands, that he substitutes, and gives to the Roman Catholick
Church, to carry it along with great successe: and that's the
first Reason, the judgment of God upon the unthankfull
world.</P>
<P>A second Reason is taken from the effectuall means which
Satan used to advance the Roman Church by,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> to exalt his
Church above all others; what were the means? The means
were these;</P>
<P>First, Ignorance, raising a smoak out of the bottomlesse Pit,
darkning all the light of the Church, <HI>Rev. 9. 2. The Sun and
the Aire were darkned by reason of it:</HI> There was a mighty
<PB N="27" REF="18"/>
dark mist as it were: They regarded not the love of the truth,
they studyed it not, and so the Lord left them to palpable
grosse ignorance, in so much that at that time when the se∣cond
beast arose, had we seene any that lived in the former
time of Religion, and that lived now, we would not have
thought they had been the same men, such palpable darkness
were they left unto of ignorance; Now palpable ignorance
is the mother of all Superstition and Idolatry, and the mis∣guidance
of all things in the Church.</P>
<P>A second means which he used, was, terror of Conscience
which he set on effectually by the Locusts, <HI>Rev. 9. 3, 5. There
came out of the smoak Locusts, and unto them was given power as the
scorpions of the Earth have power:</HI> They had such a notable
power to sting the Consciences of men, that men would seek
for death, and could not finde it, and take desperate courses,
drowning, or hanging, or any thing, rather then to live in
that terrour. They that shall read <HI>Parsons Resolutions Grana∣tensis,</HI>
shall find what terrible threats there are applyed to ter∣rifie,
but never shewed them the way to come to Christ, to
binde up such broken souls: Now the Conscience broken
and not healed, is fit to sow any superstition in.</P>
<P>A third means was the superstition and hypocrisie of the
votaries, and of all afflicted, but unsetled consciences. Terror
of conscience makes them greatly devout; They tell them
of a state of perfection, and that they shall shrowd themselves
in such a Monastery, and there they should live devoutly, and
be kept from the pollutions of the world; Many Princes
have been thus taken, and have given large endowments to
pray for their souls, their consciences being wounded.</P>
<P>A fourth meanes was the subtilty and sophistry of the
School-men, suppressing the reading of the Scriptures, and
mixing Philosophy with Divinity, that they might as well
have studied a point of <HI>Aristotle</HI> as their divinity, and make
as good use of the one as of the other. They left studying of
Scriptures, and read <HI>Peter Lombard,</HI> which was mentioned in
Latine, and this was a notable meanes.</P>
<P>A fifth meanes was the policy of the Canonists, who had
gathered together all those Canons that tended to Christs
powerfull Government, and fastned them upon the Catho∣lick
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
Church, and the Bishop of Rome being head, he had
it all committed to him, a notable means to bring in Ty∣ranny.</P>
<P>Last of all lying miracles, 2 <HI>Thes. 2. 9. Whose coming is af∣ter
the working of Satan, with all power, and signes, &amp; lying wonders.</HI>
Thus you see the means how the Dragon gave him his power,
and Authority, and such Authority that he exalts himself a∣bove
all that is called God.</P>
<P>The use is thus much; First it serves to shew the vanity of
all that admiration of the Roman Catholick visible Church,
and devotion to that Church, which hath so long for many
Ages deluded the world, and with which Jesuites and Semi∣naries
doe to this day delude devout, but carnall souls; Here
is great power given to them, and great authority; but whence
hath the Church all this? They pretend they have it all
from Christ, but they have it from the Dragon of the bot∣tomlesse
pit; He gave him his power and seat and great au∣thority:
It never came from Christ, he never gave this pow∣er
to any Church nor State in the world, it is from the Dra∣gon.
And whereas they plead it is the keys of the kingdome
of Heaven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 19. It is verely (as the Text calls it, <HI>Rev.
9. 1.) The key of the Bottomlesse pit; There fell a star from Hea∣ven
to the Earth, and to him was given the key of the Bottomlesse pit:</HI>
It is he that hath power to let out smoak out of the bottom∣lesse
pit; Not to let out men from thence, as some have pre∣tended,
or from <HI>Limbus,</HI> which is the suburbs of Hell; But to
let out smoak, damnable doctrine, and false Government;
He hath power to open it, but no power to shut it; power to
sting mens consciences, but no power to heal them. And
therefore when <HI>Bellarmine</HI> makes the Roman Catholick visi∣ble
Church to be the true Church, he makes this the first
note of a true Catholick Church; whereas our Divines make
Preaching of the word, and administration of the Sacraments,
and holy Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cipline, he refutes them, and sets down three o∣ther,
universall, Catholick, visible Church, to be the true
Church; And the truth is, it is the very Beast, to which the
Devill gave this great Authority and power: Wherefore let
not men be bewitched with them, but let us know they are all
but efficacies of delusions what ever have been in this kinde
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>
spoken. If any man say, shall we disclaim an Article of our
Creed, to despise the holy Catholick Church? God forbid,
we doe believe the holy Catholick Church spread over all
Nations; But a Church Catholick that shall have one visible
head, and be the Mother Church, verily we look at it as the
greatest and ugliest beast, that ever was raised in the world.
Take all other Monarchies that the Scripture describes, the
Leopard of <HI>Greece,</HI> the Lyon of <HI>Babell,</HI> and the Bear of <HI>Persiae,</HI>
and they are either of them but a beastly state, but here all
these Beasts are mingled and confounded in one: And besides,
<HI>It hath seven heads, and ten horns.</HI> A Leopard, a Lyon, and a
Beare, they are orderly creatures, according to some Institu∣tion:
But here is a Beast that runs besides all institution, and
description of Scripture, and societies of men that ever was
raised. The Catholick visible Roman Church, is the most
monster; God forbid we should blaspheme any Church, but
I do but speak Scripture; Let the world be judg, if the Scrip∣ture
can be accommodated to any but to this Roman-Catho∣lick
mother Church. It is evident in Scripture, these <HI>seven
heads, and ten horns,</HI> must be some <HI>Roman</HI> State, the Roman Pa∣gan
State it cannot be, nor yet the Roman Christian State,
and a Roman State it is: but there hath been no other Ro∣man
State, but the Roman-Catholick visible Church, and
that hath claimed such great power and authority, which
is doubtlesse as incompatible to Scripture as may be, which
by the wit of man hath not been invented, but by the
Dragon; and yet so goodly in the eyes of the world, which
great Princes are deluded and besotted withall, and happy
they that can be reconciled to that State.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> Learn we to magnifie the free rich grace of God
that hath delivered us from this great Beast, and the worship
of it, and hath restored us in a great measure to the govern∣ment
of primative simplicity, that now we may meet every
Lords day, <HI>that all may heare, and all may be edefied,</HI> where every
one may brign his offence (if hee cannot be satisfied in pri∣vate)
and may be heard, and the case in due time searched
into, and healed according to God. This is Primative sim∣plicity,
and this is direct proceeding without Lordly Prela∣cy,
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
which overwhelms all the world like a great Sea; And it
i, well called a Sea, for it swallows up all like a vast Ocean.</P>
<P>And the more thankfull ought we to be, that he hath deli∣vered
us from the Image of the Beast, as well as from the beast
it selfe; A Catholick Church that beareth sway over so many
hundred Churches, and overwhelms them all: Such Lawes
they shall make as shall binde all Nations, and whether they
give consent or no, they must subscribe to them in point of
government. Were we sensible how odious this Beast were in
the sight of the holy Ghost, and of the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> it would
affect us with strong thankfulnesse, and hearty enlargednesse
to God, that hath delivered us from so great a beast, and
from any image and picture of it, unto which all the world
is subject, unlesse in some few places.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> It may teach all Church Officers not to affect a∣ny
Lordly pomp and state: For Officers of a Church to take
upon them any great State, or to see a Church composed in
any such form, you see in the eyes of the holy Ghost it is a
Beast. There is nothing more disproportionable to us, then
for us to affect Supremacy, for us to weare the hornes that
might push Kings; to throw downe any, or to desire Magi∣strates
to execute what we shall think fit, verily it is not com∣patible
to the simplicity of the Church of Christ. Neither
may they give their power to us, nor may we take it from
them: That when an Excommunication passe in the Church,
then to leave it to the Magistrate, that so a man being excom∣municated,
is left, <HI>Ipso facto,</HI> to civill censure, upon the Chur∣ches
censure, this will cause the Magistrates to submit their
power to the Church unavoidably; that if a Church censure,
the Magistrates must proceed against them: Now it is good to
have these two States so joyned together, that the simplicity
of the church may be maintained and upheld, and strengthe∣ned
by the civill State according to God, but not by any sim∣plicity
further then according to the word. Beware of all se∣cular
power, and Lordly power, of such vast inspection of
one church over another: Take heed of any such usurpation,
it will amount to some monstrous Beast: Leave every church
Independant, not Independant from brotherly counsell;
God forbid that we should refuse that; but when it comes to
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
power, that one Church shall have power over the rest, then
look for a Beast, which the Lord would have all his people to
abhor.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> let it be in the feare of God an use to beware
how we take Satans offers. This very offer Christ had once
made to him by this Dragon, he came to Christ, and said
<HI>(Luke 4. 6, 7.) All this power will I give thee, and the glory of
them, for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give
it; if thou therefore wilt worship mee, all shall be thine.</HI> Hee said
thus far true, that he had a great stroke in the Kingdomes of
the world (but yet it was limited to him) for it's true, hee
was the god of the world, in the time of Heathenish and Po∣pish
apostacy; He offers Christ he will give it all to him, if he
will fall down and worship him; The Lord Jesus rejects him,
<HI>It is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
thou serve.</HI> When he offers such baites, and barbarous tempta∣tions
as these be, we are to rej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct him. The Devill comes and
offers this to the Vicar of Christ (as they call him) I wil give
you government over all the Churches in the world, and
Kingdoms, and States; and he in very deed takes Satans offer,
and doth take all the pomp and state of the world. Time was
when <HI>Naaman</HI> the Assyrian offered large matters to <HI>Elisha</HI> for
healing him of his Leprosie, but the Prophet would have
none of them (though he was no Pagan) for when he came
home, they would aske, what did it cost you? he might say,
it cost me not a groat, but what it cost me in the Innes where I
lay; this is honour to Religion: His servant <HI>Gehezi</HI> indeed
runs after him, <HI>As the Lord liveth, he shall not goe so away, but he
will have a reward;</HI> He makes an excuse, <HI>There are two sonnes of
the Prophets come, and he desires a talent of silver, and two changes
of garments;</HI> and hee very liberally fastens a great deale more
on him then he asks: What, saith <HI>Elisha, Is this a time to take
money, and to receive garments, and Olive-yards, and Vine-yards,
and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants?</HI> Hee
meant such money as would buy all these; <HI>The leprosie there∣fore
of Naaman shall cleave unto thee:</HI> And so truly the lepro∣sie
of Antichrist, and of the Catholick Church cleave to us,
if we take up any thing that derogates from the simple, and
naked, and sheep-like government of Christ Jesus; It will be
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
a Leprosie that wil cleave to us, &amp; make us grow more &amp; more
leprous: And therefore it must teach us not to regard the pro∣fits
and pleasures of this world: I speak chiefly to men, as we
are Church-members; Such simple government, though it
hath horns (for the Lamb hath horns, and can tell how to
push) yet meeknesse and simplicity is best: Just and faithfull
Administrations becomes the simplicity of civill government,
but how much more the Church of Christ, that so this great
and vast Beast may be kept away from us.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 5.</NOTE> it may teach us all, as ever wee desire, not to grow
monstrous and ugly in the sight of the Lord Jesus, to take
heed of hearkning to any power of Nationall Churches, you
will finde that this will grow to such ugly deformity, that
God will turn away his face from you: You will never finde
him as in times of ignorance; Though God hath pardoned
what we did in ignorance, not knowing what wee did (as
Christ prayed, <HI>Luke 23. 34. Father forgive them, they know not
what they doe.)</HI> And I doubt not but he doth the like for ma∣ny
of our deare brethren, who in their ignorance do submit
to the Beast, and the image of the Beast, and doth vouchsafe
his gracious presence with them: But for us here, if we shall
in our hearts turn back againe to <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and be content to
stoop to these Superstitions, and be thus ruled, for order, and
forme of worship (believe it) then we may looke for an end
of all our prosperity, and liberty of the Churches here; Then
look we should grow mishapen and monstrous, and look ug∣ly,
we shall then soon see an end of all the comforts of the
Churches here. As therefore God hath betrusted us with such
a handsome body as hee is pleased to own, so continue in
your profession, and in the maintenance of the same even to
death.</P>

<Q>And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death,
and his deadly wound was healed, and all the world
wondered after the Beast.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN these words is described the variation of the state of the
Beast in respect of one of his heads.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John</HI> saw it as it were wounded to death, and all men
thought it unrecoverable; that is one State.</P>
<P>2. A State of recovery, <HI>His deadly wound was healed.</HI></P>
<P>3. The effects of this healing
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The worlds admiration
after the Beast.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Their worship both of
the Dragon &amp; the Beast.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>For a little opening of the words.</P>
<P><HI>I saw one of his heads.]</HI> You heard before that the Beast had
seven heads: Now as the Scribes asked Christ concerning the
woman that had seven Husbands, <HI>whose wife shall she be of the
seven?</HI> So here is a Beast hath seven heads, and one is woun∣ded,
which of the seven must it be? To this the Apostle <HI>John</HI>
tells us, <HI>Chap. 17. That five of them were gone;</HI> they had been,
but were not now, and these are the seven governments of
the Roman State: These five had been Kings and Consuls,
Decemviers, Dictators, Tribunes. The sixth yet was, and
that was the <HI>Caesars,</HI> the Roman Emperours they were the
sixth head, whether Christian or Pagan, it differs not much
the state of the Government, for they were all governed by
Roman Laws, under one head or other. Now therefore what
is this that is here spoken of, <HI>One of his heads were as it were
wounded to death?</HI> was it the Roman Emperour, whether Pa∣gan
or Christian? you heard reasons before why it could not
be Pagan, nor indeed Christian <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>1. That head was crowned, but this hath no Crown; All
the seven heads were crowned, they governed and exer∣cised
their Administrations in the world, <HI>Rev. 12. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>
But here these heads are not crowned, but the Crowns
are upon the Horns.</P>
<P>2. Neither can it be they, because of this wound upon this
head, The Roman Christian Emperours they never cha∣lenged
to themselves Head-ship over the Church of <HI>Rome.
Constantine</HI> doth utterly abandon it; He professeth he
ought to be judged by them, and not they by him. And
<HI>Theodosius</HI> doth submit himselfe to <HI>Ambrose</HI> censure, and
doth not exercise any Head-ship over the Church: It was
not therefore the Emperours, for they were not heads of
the Church.</P>
<P>3. It is said, the wound here given, was healed, to the ad∣miration
of the world: Now certaine it is, the wound
given by the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandalls,</HI> it was never healed to
this day: but the Eastern part was swallowed up by the
Turk. And for the Emperors of the West, <HI>Charles</HI> the
great, and his Successors, though they healed a branch of
it, yet it was far off from healing the wound of the Ro∣man
Empire, those wounds have decayed, and fall short
of that which was the admiration of the Nations: Nor
was it the healing of this wound from the first time it
was given, that was the admiration of the world. There∣fore
it must be some head that was so wounded, as all the
world wondered at it, and were captive to it; You heard
it was not the Roman Christian Emperors, it must be
him that claimes to be head over all the Churches, and
who is that but <HI>Pontifex maximus?</HI> It was that which <HI>The∣odosias</HI>
abhor'd, he thought it an unworthy style for a
Christian Emperour to be accounted the great high Priest
of the Church; but what he laid down, they willingly
took up, to be accounted the great Pastor of the Church,
and therefore he is the head of the Church: For if it be
neither Pagan nor Christian Emperours, it must be the
government that succeeded them, they were the sixth,
and hee is the seventh: It is the seventh head that was
thus wounded, and whose wound was afterward
healed.</P>
<P>Qu. 2. <HI>Now a second Question will be,</HI> If he be the seventh
head, the head of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> If he be this head, then when
was he wounded?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="22"/>
<HI>Answ:</HI> When the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandalls,</HI> and <HI>Hunnes,</HI> and other
barbarous Nations overwhelmed <HI>Italy,</HI> and the western parts.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Alaricus</HI> about the yeare 415. took <HI>Rome;</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d I remem∣ber
in a Treatise of <HI>Hierom</HI> (saith he) The government which
then was left of the Church before, was wholly taken away,
as if a man were beheaded, and yet it fell after into worse ca∣lamity.</P>
<P>2. It was after taken againe by <HI>Adulphus,</HI> who thought to
change the name of it, and call it <HI>Gothia.</HI></P>
<P>3. It was taken againe by <HI>Gensericus Vandalus.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>Odoacer Rugionus</HI> reigned in it fourteen years.</P>
<P>5. After him, <HI>Theodoricus</HI> King of the <HI>Goths</HI> having slaine
him, his Successor <HI>Totilas</HI> destroyed it, and brought it to such
desolation, that there was neither man, woman, nor child
seen in it for forty dayes. Now this was such a wound, that
all the Bishops in the world that were wont to give homage
to him, they now began to neglect his Head-ship, that was but
a servant at home: They despised him, to be the head of the
Church, that was a servant to <HI>Barbarians;</HI> Insomuch, that the
Bishop of <HI>Revenna,</HI> he challengeth universall Supremacy, he
takes indignation at him, that he will be Lord Paramount:
But so great was the wound, that indeed the Roman Bishop
was utterly discouraged, and this continued for 140. yeares
together; and though he would have used many meanes for
his cure, and have called in help from the Emperor of <HI>Greece,</HI>
yet he was not willing to help him, for they had fallen out
before about worshipping of Images; he was constant for I∣mages,
the other was against them, and so he might sinke or
swim for them; so his wound seemed incurable.</P>
<P><HI>Quest:</HI> 3. When was this wound cured, and how?</P>
<P><HI>Answ:</HI> By degrees.</P>
<P>1. In the yeare 555. the Lord stirred up <HI>Justinian,</HI> who by
his Generalls, <HI>Belisarius</HI> and <HI>Morses,</HI> drove and destroyed
the <HI>Goths</HI> out of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>2. By <HI>Justinians</HI> novell Constitutions, we decree according
to the Canons of the holy Councels, the most holy Bi∣shop
of old <HI>Rome</HI> to be the first (or to have the Primacy)
of all Priests.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="23"/>
3. <HI>Phocas</HI> the <HI>Parricide</HI> about fifty yeares after, about the
yeare 606. healed up the wound, granting to <HI>Boniface</HI>
the third, that he should be universall Bishop, not only
the first in order, but in honour also, and that all the
whole world should be his Diocesse: And this was the
healing of his Head, which was so perfectly cured, that
all the world wondered at the preservation of the head
of this Church, and began by degrees more and more to
adore both the Church, and the Head of it.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> There is an Objection made against this exposition; That by
this means the Bishop of Rome should be healed before he be a head of
Beast, for this was his headship when he was allowed to be chief Lord
over all the Churches, and all the rest to be under him; and the Pope
was not this head till the Act of <HI>Phocas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I answer, He had not the peaceable possession of this
Headship till this time, but yet it is evident in story that he
did claim this supremacy before, he sought it ambitiously,
and it was given him by the devotion of many Bishops, and
Churches, and Nations, it was usually rendred to him long
before that time. <HI>Socrates</HI> saith, that <HI>Ballo</HI> the Pope had bro∣ken
forth into the Government over the Churches: And
<HI>Bellarmine</HI> himselfe confesseth (when he is put to it) that the
Bishop of Rome would never goe to any Consultation in the
East, but sent his Legat; for saith he, it is not meet the head
should follow the members: A second reason he gives, the
Emperor (saith he) is at least Vice-gerent of the East, he well
may have the materiall Seat that was taken up by the Empe∣rors,
where shall the Bishop of Rome sit then? and this he ga∣thers
out of some of their writings: So that it is evident,
that he did ambitiously desire it, and the manner was (being
elderly men) all his beloved and dear children they call him
Father, and so he takes in good part all their honorable Ti∣tles,
and he destributes to them such parcells of respect, as
may stand with his own Sumpremacy, and their subjection,
and therefore they need not say, The wounded head was hea∣led
before he was a head of the Beast, for it was in conception
long before. He did from <HI>Constantines</HI> time seek Supremacy:
They confesse, little respect was had to him in <HI>Constantines</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>
time; But when order was set in Churches, he took all ad∣vantages
for his exaltation, and did take all appeals from o∣thers,
that what others did to him in respect of his gravity, &amp;
learning, and understanding, he takes as done to him as sitting
in <HI>Peters</HI> Chaire, and so did challenge headship in those times,
and they thought it was meet to give it; And after this, he
was ratified, and confirmed, and established in peace, then
was his wound healed.</P>
<P>Come we then to gather a note or two from the word;
The first note you may observe is this.</P>
<P>The ambition and arrogancy of Church Officers claym∣ing
headship over the Church of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctr. 1.</NOTE> the Lord plagues it
with a mortall wound, and crusheth it even to the death.</P>
<P>I gather it out of these words, <HI>I saw one of his heads as it
were wounded to death;</HI> It was one of the heads of the Catholick
Church; As the body was a Monster, so was the head;
to set a head over such a vast body it was a Monster in Gods
sight: The Lord wil not suffer him to go on in this ambitious
designe, but will meet him as he did <HI>Balaam,</HI> when he crushed
his foot against the wall, and if he had gone on, he had sleine
him, <HI>Numb.</HI> 22. 32, 33. So doth the Lord here meet the Bi∣shop
of Rome; if he will be the head of the visible Church,
and animate such a Body, what will the Lord doe? He will
wound him to death, and slay him, and crush his spirituall
arrogancy, that under pretence of Vicarship to Christ, will
yet be the Lord of the Church.</P>
<P>The Reason of the point is,</P>
<P>From the dishonour put upon Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> to take the headship
from him to whom it belongeth. This honour to be the head
of the Church is the proper right of the Lord Jesus: It is
his, First by gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t from the Father, <HI>Ephes. 1. 22. To be head
ever all things to the Church:</HI> and <HI>Col. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. He is the head of the
body the Church.</HI> Secondly, it is his by Purchase: <HI>He gave him∣selfe
to death, even the death of the Crosse; and God hath
highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above e∣very
name,</HI> Phil. 2. 8, 9. <HI>He dyed and rose again, that he might
be Lord both of the dead and living,</HI> Rom. 14. 9. So that now
when the Lord hath this headship of the Church granted him,
<PB N="38" REF="24"/>
and also hath purchased it by his own death; now for ano∣ther
to claym headship, it must needs imply, either that the
head is a non-resident, or else thrust out of his headship, he
doth administer. And though the Lord be not present in bo∣dy,
yet in his spirituall presence, he is as truely present, and
more effectually then any that can be devised. And there∣fore
in regard of injury done to Christ, which the Lord
will not bear, he will therefore crush, and wound such
heads.</P>
<P>2dly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> From the sacrilegious injury put upon the Church:
It is an usurpation of all power from the Church, that if a
Catholick Church be met, they will give power and Lawes
to other Churches, and look what the second Beast doth, he
administers all the power of the first Beast; Look what pow∣er
is given to the Catholick Church, that doth the Bishop of
Rome incorporate to himself, and he causeth an Image of
that Church to be made in Provinciall Nations; which when
they have taken hold, like a Bears claws, they will not easily
be rooted out: Now this is such injurous usurpation, that
from that day to this, they have never been free; That where
the Pope hath had to doe, the Churches are spoiled of the au∣thority
that is given to them by Christ; And therefore you
must not wonder if the Lord wound the head of such as goe
on in their wickednesse, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68. 20, 21. The jealousie of the
Lord riseth against such usurpations: For a visible Catho∣lick
Church to be set over the world, who may make Lawes
to rule conscience, and make Officers for the ordering of all
Churches; It is such a Monster, and the Government of
it is so odious in the sight of God, that he wounds it to
death.</P>
<P>For the use of the point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> It may serve to provoke us all to
pray heartily, and faithfully, for the repressing of all such
heads as either the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> is, or any Images of him
whatsoever they be. You read of a little horn in <HI>Daniel,</HI>
whose root was stubbed up; wherever you read of any horns
that will usurpe power over the Church, look at it (as it is)
abominable to Christ, it provokes the spirit of Christ, Sove∣raign
Authority is his: If the Lord be set upon the hill of
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>
Sion, he will wound the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> or any that shall
take his Image; He will give them a deadly blow, especial∣ly
when they are more arrogant, then his Indignation ari∣seth
against them, to execute judgement on such. The head∣ship
of the Church is a singular priviledge to the Lord Jesus,
and incompitable to any: They must either take Christs of∣fice
out of his hands, or think him negligent, or non-resident,
and that he doth not sufficiently discharge his headship, and
therefore they will usurpe an office in his name, but that is
abominable to Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> But you will say, So wee shall pluck the Crowne off from
the heads of Christian Princes, for they challenge that stile to be head
of the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I doe not know any Christian Prince that chalen∣geth
that stile. That which was sometimes given to <HI>Saul,</HI>
may be given to Princes, 1 <HI>Sam. 15. 17. When thou wast little
in thine eyes, wast thou not made the head of the Tribes of Israel?</HI>
That is true, and so the King is head of all the Peeres, and
head of all the Shires, and the Churches are in some or other
of them, that is,</P>
<P>1. They have power over the Church in all civill mat∣ters.</P>
<P>2. And I will say thus much, that they have power to re∣dresse
and reforme inordinate abuses in the Church, provo∣king
Church officers to doe it; If they doe not, other Chur∣ches
are to treat with them; and if their corruptions be pre∣judicial
either to the doctrine of the Gospell, or if they dege∣nerate
to any Tyranny, they are to look to redresse such
things, but this gives them not headship over the Church;
over their persons it doth, but not over the Church, that
is,</P>
<P>1. They have no power either to call Church-officers, or
to depose them.</P>
<P>2. They have no power to dispence Church-censures.</P>
<P>3. They have no power to suspend Church liberties.</P>
<P>4. They have no power to appoint Church-ordinances;
nor power to administer any matter further then any
other member of the Church: and this did the Church
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>
of <HI>England</HI> acknowledge, and no more then this was due:
Therefore we allow some power and authority to Prin∣ces,
and Magistrates, in the sence spoken of; If they
claime any further, it will so kindle the jealousie of the
Lord, that the Lord wil certainly wound it to the crack∣ing
of the Crowns of all that take it upon them: which
may be a notable warning to all Church-men (I mean
Church officers) to beware of cleeking into their hands
the power which God hath not given them; the Lord
will wound their heads, he will not endure it, 'tis a pri∣viledge
that he hath purchased with his owne bloud. I
think there is no need here to presse it; but this let me
say, it is a just motive to pray the more ardently, and
faithfully for the crushing of such heads, wherever the
Lord findes any arrogant head, that any Church-officer
will undertake to give Lawes to the Churches in their
diocesse, that they will put Officers upon them, that they
will suspend them at their pleasure, and put in, and put
out, whether the Church will or no; This kinde of in∣solency
in such a state, let it look for a wound, for a
wound it shall have. And therefore, we are the more
encouraged to pray for, and to look for deliverance from
these Heads; for John tells us, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5. 14. that <HI>if we
aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us;</HI> And this
is according to the will of God, that all ambitious heads
be wounded: What he hath done he will doe, <HI>There is
no new thing under the Sun;</HI> he spares, and changes, and
wounds in every change: Persons are changed, but Gods
administrations are one and the same: If Gods indig∣nation
have been ardently kindled against the Bishop of
<HI>Rome,</HI> he will certainly visite such powers as take upon
them to put doctrine upon the Church; to take away
Church liberties; and sometimes to scater one Church
from another, the Lord will certainly visit it, we may
pray for it, and comfortably expect it.</P>
<P>The next note is this;</P>
<P>That though God doe wound and crush,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctr. 2.</NOTE> and represse the
arrogance of Church officers, affecting headship over all
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
Churches for a time, yet he doth sometimes again heal their
wounds, and binde up their breaches, and give free passage to
their ambitious designes.</P>
<P>This is evident here, <HI>I saw one of his heads, as it were wounded
to death</HI> (and you have heard when, and how) and yet,
which is wonderfull, <HI>His deadly wound was healed,</HI> and that to
the admiration of all the world; <HI>And all the world wondred after
the Beast,</HI> to see a wound so really and perfectly healed: when
this Church was wounded, afterwards the Pope was per∣fectly
recovered, but the wound of <HI>Caesars</HI> head was left blee∣ding,
both in the East and West. This head must therefore be
the spirituall head of <HI>Rome:</HI> God though he represse some
insolency, yet he doth many times give free passage to their
designes at length. He did so with <HI>Balaam,</HI> he met with him
in the way, and had not the Asse hindred, certainly he had
slain him, <HI>Numb. 22. 32. Because thy way was perverse before
me, saith God: Balaak</HI> had sent him word, that if he would
come and curse the people that were come out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> that
he would give him this, and that; he saw he had an eye to
these outward things; The Lord seeing his way perverse, he
would have killed him; but yet at length in <HI>v. 35. The An∣gell
of the Lord said unto</HI> Balaam, <HI>if it be thy minde to go, I will
give thee leave, go with the men, but onely the word that I shall
speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak;</HI> And when he comes, he
doth blesse the people to the Indignation of the King of <HI>Mo∣ab;</HI>
but afterwards when <HI>Balaam</HI> saw that he should loose all
that he came for; come, saith he to the King, take some course
to invite the Gallants of <HI>Israel</HI> to a feast (and it was an Ido∣latrous
feast to the honour of <HI>Baal Peor)</HI> and so the anger of
the Lord was kindled against <HI>Israel,</HI> and there were foure and
twenty thousand dyed of the Plague, and at length <HI>Balaam</HI>
was slaine also: But yet you see, he gives way to his cove∣teous
designes, to satisfie himselfe to the full, though he af∣terward
visited his Sinne upon him. So did the Lord here
with the Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> he wounded him as it were to
death, and afterwards he heals him, and raiseth him up again,
and sent <HI>Justinian</HI> to destroy the <HI>Goths</HI> out of <HI>Italy;</HI> and he be∣ing
a wise man, gives him his Titles, and makes him Bishop
<PB N="42" REF="26"/>
of Bishops, inspector over all the rest, and perfectly cures
him; That whereas before he had lost his Titles, and one or
other wrote against him; the Emperor being loath to make
their own Arch-Bishop (that lived in their City with them)
chief, for disturbing their civill Government; They had ra∣ther
conferre all that honour upon him that had been so ad∣mired
&amp; worshiped for so many years, especially having had
32 M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nasteries, &amp; had been more Orthodoxall then all other
Churches: These were great inducements to give all ho∣nour
to the Pope, though they saw him desperately woun∣ded;
but when they see him recovered, they wonder at him,
and every one submits to him, especially the Western parts;
though they in the East also would consult with him, and be
led and guided by him, and all their decrees in counsell were
referred to him; if he did dislike them, they were antequa∣ted;
if he did approve them, they were received as Authenti∣call
Lawes of the Church.</P>
<P>You may aske, why the Lord would heal such an abomina∣ble
and ugly Beast, this visible Catholick Church, and this
Beast that was one of the heads of this Church; for he had a
beastly shape; take him alone without the other Beast, and
take them together, here is a great Beast; afterwards he is
called in <HI>Chap. 17. the great whore,</HI> and she sits upon this Beast,
and he hath all his supportance from her; he restores the
Church, and the head of the Beast to that state they were in
before; The reason why God doth this is double.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> in regard of his just displeasure against the backsli∣ding
apostacies of the Church in such times: When the Lord
sees the spirits of men are bent to apostacy and backsliding,
so as that they reject the simplicity of the Gospell of Christ,
and if they might have it they will not; now it is a righteous
thing with God to plague them with the arrogance &amp; tyran∣ny
of Antichrist: <HI>If I come in my Fathers name, you will not re∣ceive
me; if another come in his own name, him you will receive;</HI>
Now it is a just judgement of God, if Christ come and offer
himself in the simplicity of his Ordinances, and they think
this is too mean, and doth not reach the state of an Imperiall
City, but they must have such and such orders in all Chur∣ches,
<PB N="43" REF="26"/>
and Churches must be distinguished by such Patrons,
and it is fit that one be Lord Paramount over them all, and
none is so fit as the Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> If people dote upon
such (some goodly shape, but drawn by the inventions of
men) well you shall have such Bishops: This head that
sometimes hath been thus wounded, that some have had cause
of solemn praise for his wounding, and God hath by this
means given the Churches liberty to take some better way of
worship, but they would not, well you shall have enough of
him. It is one of <HI>Solomons</HI> Proverbs, <HI>(Chap. 14. 14.) the
Backslider in heart shall be filled with his own wayes;</HI> If you dote
after inventions of men, you shall be filled with vain Super∣stition
to the contentment of your own hearts. God out of
his tender faithfulnesse to his Church he will redeem some,
and doth give them faire opportunities to undertake their
own liberties out of the usurpations of men; but if they
will rather sit under the shadow of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> then feed upon
<HI>Manna,</HI> then goe you back again saith God, none of you
shall eat of that which I have prepared, that is one Reason;
Such backsliders that delight in such communion in such
heads over their Churches, it is just with God to fill them
with their own inventions.</P>
<P>The second Reason is taken from the just judgement of
God upon such kinde of heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> that doe affect such ambiti∣on;
the Lord will shew them this favour, he will crosse them
as he did <HI>Balaam;</HI> but if their hearts be bent to go on in their
mischevous course, he gives them leave to fulfill their own
lusts to their own perdition; And thus he did <HI>Balaam,</HI> he
gave him leave not onely to blesse the people, but to draw
them aside from God; for he could not have taken a more
ready course to have cast them out of Gods favour, then to
draw them to offer Sacrafice to <HI>Baal,</HI> for that was one of the
worst dunghill gods. It is out of Gods righteous judge∣ment,
when a man will not be reclaimed, when the Lord
wounds, and crushes him, and brings him to the last gaspe,
if he have a licourish affection still; now it is an usuall thing
with God to pay men to their own perdition: And there∣fore
in <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 11. It is said, <HI>the beast that was and is not, shall
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
goe into perdition,</HI> that's the head of this Beast; that is the next
newes you heare of this second beast here in the Text, and
therefore it is called both the beast, and the head of the beast,
where the first beast is presented in the form of a great whore,
who is to be brought to the last gaspe; A whore she was, but
he presents her to <HI>John</HI> as a great beast; Now hee gives him
leave to rise againe to his own perdition, and of many thou∣sands
more. Thus you see the truth of the point.</P>
<P>Now for the use of it.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> it may be a just watch-word and warning to all the
Sons of men, to beware of Gods checks. When the Lord
checks you, crushes your Crowns, and exposeth you to this
and that danger in one kind or other, beware of this;
whether you be the children of God or not, yet come home
effectually to him; for this you shall finde, if you be in di∣stress,
and call, he is ready to heare; He will heare <HI>Ishmael;</HI>
and he hears the Lyons that roar, <HI>and seek their meat of him;</HI> He
will many times, once, or twice, or thrice do thus: But if the
Lord once strike, and almost crush you, beware now that you
lay aside all carnall ends and ambitious designes; for other∣wise,
if you shall recover againe, and persist in your former
wayes without repentance, then the next news is, you goe
on to perdition: And therefore when ever the Lord affects us,
and afflicts us in any kind, it is heavenly wisdome to be war∣ned
by the least phylip of his finger; be warned by any sick∣nesses,
crosses, danger by Land or Sea, by any thing whatsoe∣ver
the Lord is pleased to exercise you with, this is both chil∣drens
bread, and the bread of strangers: Beware you goe not
on still, but if the Lord check you, then turn back again; but
if you go forward, be sure you go to God-ward, and accor∣ding
to Gods will, and after Gods ends:</P>
<P>This is that which God calls for, that you walke more
exactly, and more accurately, <HI>Ephes. 5. 15. See then that yee
walke circumspectly, not as fooles, but as wise, redeeming the time;</HI>
because God hath thus and thus taken paines with you, and
hath thus and thus been as a Leopard in your paths. It is a
strong speech that in <HI>Amos 3. 5. Will a man lay a snare</HI> (and
the word is a deadly snare) <HI>will a man lay a deadly snare, and
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>
take it up, and catch nothing?</HI> The Lord will catch a prey when
he layes a trap for us, and he will not leave till he have girded
our loynes and our hearts close to him, and made us more
exact in our way, or otherwise if he let us slip, it will be to
perdition: And therefore let all that heare the word, ever be
sensible of the least wounds &amp; checks, especially if they grow
to some bulky frame: <HI>I saw one of his heads as it were wounded
to death,</HI> and this deadly wound was healed, and it was healed
to immortall perdition, and therefore all that wonder after
the Beast, they are such as have no part in the Lambs book of
Life, they have no part in Christ.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> It may teach us the more earnestly to wrestle
with God by faithfull and earnest prayer for any of the Chur∣ches
of Christ in any parts of the world; that if the Lord give
them an opportunity to wound the head of any Image of the
Beast, any of his heads or horns, then it will be necessary that
all such Churches do take the hint and opportunity that God
puts into their hands, and that they do not rather close with
such heads whom God wounds, and be loath to lay hold of
those liberties that he procures for them: But let this be the
constant care of Christians to desire that such heads may not
be usurping: but if the Lord gives an opportunity, the Lord
looks that all Christians should improve it, to vindicate
themselves, when the Lord gives any hint thereof: When he
gives an opportunity, then is the time; when the iron is hot,
then strike; Intreat God, that when he puts a prize into their
hands, that they then may learn to get wisdome, and not in
their hearts turn to tolerate arrogant designes, and such as
are ugly in the sight of God: When God wounds the head of
Enemies, and casts shame upon them, and hath rescued his
people from them; If Churches shal again comply with them,
then what will the end of that be? It is a fearfull thing, such
kind of Heads goe to perdition, and those that dote upon
such Heads. It is a check especially for this great beast of
<HI>Rome,</HI> but it will be dangerous for other States too: This
will be the finall issue, they shall have enough of it, they shall
be filled with Hirarchicall power, and with their Agents in
Civill States, their feete like a Beare will raven in all, that
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>
they shall all be weary of the burden, and shall be so filled
with them, as to spew them out of their mouths: And there∣fore
how should we help the people of God to traverse that
wounded Head that it never rise up more.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> this may serve to teach such whose Heads have at
any time been wounded; As there is none of the servants of
God, but sometimes he will have them sacrifice their <HI>Isaac,</HI>
that which is most deare to them: The Lord will rend away
our most desirable comforts; he will follow us there, where
we most of all are affected: And let this teach the people of
God, that if the Lord then bow their hearts to unfeigned re∣pentance,
turning from all evill in their hands and hearts,
how then? If the Lord will restore the wounded head of a
beast, a beastly head, of a beastly shape, will he not much
more restore the hearts of his servants that seek to him for
healing of all their corruptions, and scattering all their
temptations, that they may walke before him according to
to his will? What saith the holy Ghost, <HI>Hos. 6. 1, 2. Hee puts
words into their mouths, come let us return unto the Lord: He hath
torne, and he will heale us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up:
after two dayes will he revive us, and the third day he will raise us
up, and we shall live in his sight.</HI> Wherein he shewes the meanes
whereby the Lord will apply this medicine to his own ser∣vants,
namely by the death and resurrection of Christ, to
which he doth allude; that <HI>as Christ dyed, and rose the third day,</HI>
so shall all that have part and portion in him; They may lye
in danger, but they shall come out in due time: but however,
it should be a warning to the sonnes of men how they adven∣ture
their lives by going into any danger where God calls
them not: But if you be brought into danger when the Lord
doth deliver, you have cause to blesse him, and to render your
selves and Families back to him, that you may walke with
more girt up spirits to God, that so he may not repent of
what deliverances he vouchsafeth to you.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Come now to speak of the sequell of the healing of this
wound; upon the healing of it there is a double effect.</P>
<P>1. The admiration of the world after the <HI>Beast.</HI></P>
<P>2. A worship, set forth by a double object, the <HI>Dragon,</HI> and
the <HI>Beast.</HI></P>
<P>3. The causes are set forth that made them to worship
them both; The <HI>Dragon</HI> in that he gave power to the
<HI>Beast,</HI> and the <HI>Beast</HI> for his unmatchable power. <HI>Who is
like unto the Beast? who is able to make war with him?</HI> Here
might be three or four Notes justly gathered from hence,
but because I affect brevity in mysticall Scriptures, I shall
compact them into one: The note is this;</P>
<P>That upon the healing of the Beasts wounded head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctrine.</NOTE> all the world
fell into an admiration of the Beast, and of his power, yea into an a∣doration
of worship, both of the Beast, and of the Dragon.</P>
<P>This containes both the latter end of the third, and part
of the fourth vers.</P>
<P>For the causes of this Admiration, they will be just rea∣sons
of the point.</P>
<P>To open the Doctrine [upon the healing of this wounded
head of the Beast] Remember the Beast is the Roman Catho∣lick
visible Church, whereof <HI>Rome</HI> was the mother City, and
mother Church, accounted of all the Churches in the world,
and the Pope is the visible head of this Church, in this Chap∣ter
called the seventh head.</P>
<P>Observe 2ly. the healing of this seventh Head, wounded by
the captivity and calamity it fell into by barbarous Nations.
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>
Upon the healing of this wounded Head, by the removal, and
scattering, and subduing of these Enemies, as also by the
playster that was put to him, when such Titles of Soveraign
Authority, were put upon him by the Emperors: Now this
was the Originall of that wonder, for so it comes in; <HI>His
deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondered after the beast:</HI>
And so he expresseth it, <HI>Chap. 17. 8. All that dwell upon the
earth shall wonder when they behold the Beast that was, and is not,
and yet is.</HI> He was when he flourished, as that which was the
great Authority of the world: He is not, when he is woun∣ded
in his head; but as it were troden under foot, wounded
to death, as if he had not been: But yet he is againe, that is,
he is restored: <HI>And they that dwell on the earth, when they saw
that, wondered to behold the Beast that was, and is not, and yet is;</HI> A
Beast that cannot be crushed and beaten downe with such des∣perate
calamities, so that's the occasion of their wonder∣ment;
now upon this occasion they fell into an admiration
of the Beast, and of his power. An admiration implies some
high esteem of some great happinesse betiding this Beast, not
only beyond their expectation, but transcendant, beyond
their apprehension and capacity to understand. For a man
doth not admire a thing, unlesse it goe not only beyond ex∣pectation,
but is transcendant above his reason and under∣standing.
Yea, beyond any meanes he could use to bring such
a thing to passe: Therefore when they see this great change,
they fall admiring of the <HI>Beast,</HI> and the head of the <HI>Beast,</HI> and
of the <HI>Dragon</HI> that gave power to the <HI>Beast,</HI> and worship them
both. For their Admiration then, let me speak something of
that; and then of their Adoration both of the <HI>Beast,</HI> and of
the <HI>Dragon.</HI></P>
<P>It was in a way of Admiration; I will not say what ex∣pressions
some have made of it, some that were called Fathers
of the Church, and have left such things in writing: It would
mightily possesse one with Admiration of the Sea of Rome,
looking at him as the Lyon of the Tribe of <HI>Judah;</HI> looking
at him as by his Primacy to be like <HI>Adam,</HI> for his Faith like
<HI>Abraham,</HI> for his government like <HI>Noah,</HI> gathering all the
world under him; for Order like <HI>Melchisedech,</HI> for his functi∣on,
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
to be Christ himselfe, deservedly to be God, after some∣times
called the Vicar of Christ, and of God; marvellous
transcendant strains put upon him, which argues a high e∣steem
of him: But to omit such things as are but flourishes,
these are reall.</P>
<P>1. That all the Churches of the world are to receive all
their doctrine and worship from them; Though it were
never so superstitious, as worshipping of Angels, and
Saints, and making use of their meditation besides Christ;
and they did receive from them more then all this, which
is the life and quintiscence of all. They looked from the
Father of the Catholick visible Church to receive Indul∣gences,
and pardon of all their sinnes: If he retained
them, then they were retained; if he remitted them, they
were remitted: This they looked for from him, not on∣ly
for Doctrine and worship, but for sealing up their
Pardon for so many hundreds and thousands of years,
and not sealed with waxe, but with a wap of Lead, and a
Seale set on that: And this was the chiefe comfort of
troubled minds in those ages, these things they received
from them, and admirable honour they put upon that
Beast, to receive all such things from them.</P>
<P>2. They made to <HI>Rome</HI> all their Appeals: What ever go∣vernment
there was in the Christian world, from thence
were their Laws, and thither were their Appeals, as out
of <HI>England</HI> and many other places, to the great distur∣bance
of Church and Common-wealth, as also large and
bountifull payments were made to them: It were a vast
thing to sum up the totall sum of constant payments
that were from every Kingdome repayed to the Sea of
<HI>Rome:</HI> And as their Appeals &amp; Payments went to <HI>Rome,</HI>
so did their bodies on pilgrimage, and it was thought a
great devotion to kisse the feet of the Pope, and to see
those blessed Shrines; Thus was their admiration of the
Beast.</P>
<P>3. They fetched from <HI>Rome</HI> the Ordination of all their
chiefe Officers: Any Arch-bishop, who-ever chose him,
yet he was not installed, but he must fetch it from <HI>Rome,</HI>
and pay well for it. And from thence they fetched all
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
their Coronation of Kings and Emperors; and sundry
fundamentall Lawes of every Catholick Kingdom were
derived from thence. All their Dispensations were
fetched from thence, that Princes might marry where
they would: And dispensation from Oaths, and from
Marriages contracted, all these things they fetched from
<HI>Rome:</HI> It was an admirable honour they put upon the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and upon the Head of it; what ever the
first Beast did, the second Beast also did; and so in wor∣shipping
the one, they worshipped the other; and in ad∣miring
one, they admired both.</P>
<P>4. They expresse their admiration in this, that they will
undertake establishing of Laws from the Sea of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and persecution of such godly persons as did not submit,
such as were different in their minds from the Catholick
Church, if they never so little swerve from that, they
undertook to execute the Laws of the Church: And if the
Church declared him him to be an Heretick, there was
no more to do, the Common-wealth presently put him
to death: And as they took upon them persecution of
their Subjects at home, so the Subjects took upon them
to depose their Princes, and might depose them, if they
would not submit their power to the Pope, so that there
was no subsisting without submitting to them. And
which is a branch of this, they undertook a vast and cost∣ly
War abroad, against the common Enemy the Turke,
whereas in very deed, whilst the Pope stands, it is not
possible any War should prosper against him; for it was
for the sinne of <HI>Rome</HI> that the Turk was advanced, a bar∣barous
and beastly Enemy, to punish a beastly Religion:
This was their admiration.</P>
<P><HI>And all the world wondered after the Beast.]</HI> He meanes as he
expounds himselfe, <HI>ver. 8. Those whose names are not written in
the book of the life of the Lamb.</HI> They that were redeemed from
the world, they were not of the world, though they lived in
it: but those in the world that were of the world, they did
honour this beast, and were subject to him, and gave all their
devotion to the Catholick Church: And when I say all the
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>
world, I meane all the Christian world, which was the visible
face of the world, the reputed world; These barbarous Na∣tions
were not then so owned; but as for the Eastern world,
they were all willing to give way to this transcendant Usur∣pation
of the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> in a generall Councell at <HI>Asia:</HI>
They looked at the reigning and Imperiall City of <HI>Rome,</HI> as
the chiefest Seate of the Catholick Church, the highest throne
of that Church, and were content that no Councell should
be ratified but by him: If hee ratified a Councell in so many
Canons, it was established; if he did not, then they were not;
and the Emperors were willing it should be so, because they
found insufficiency in themselves to maintaine the Royal Ci∣ty
of Rome against barbarous Nations: And therefore they
thought it State-policy to maintain the Bishop of Rome, and
let him grow up to as great power as he could; It was as
they thought, the preservation of their State (but it was in∣deed
their ruine) so they willingly gave their power to the
beast: Now the barbarous Nations that had not forsaken the
Country, and had builded them houses, they that were not
driven out (as many rested in some parts of the Empire)
they willingly closed with such a Religion as was pretty sa∣voury
to their apprehensions, they began to comply with
it, and put their necks under it. <HI>Charles</HI> the Great having
received the Kingdome of <HI>France</HI> from the Pope, he did his
best endeavour to bring the people to yeeld themselves, but
the people were somewhat sowr and rugged that way to be
wrought upon: Therefore the Pope had another sophistry to
help himselfe; He sends three Apostles, <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great, he
was one Apostle that he sent for <HI>England,</HI> and he brings great
Reformation, that is, he sways the whole State to the Bishop
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and those that would not yeeld were miserably
slaughtered. And <HI>Bonifacius</HI> he did the like in <HI>Genevah,</HI> and in
<HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> And where ever the
world was Christian, it was now Catholick, all submitted to
the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and so by this means all the world ad∣mired
him, they received doctrine and worship from Rome,
they will goe for pardon of Sin thither: They make Pilgri∣mages
to <HI>Rome,</HI> Appeals to <HI>Rome;</HI> From thence they receive
<PB N="52" REF="31"/>
their fundamental Constitutions, Disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsations, Persecutions,
deposition of Princes; They receive and undertake generall
war from thence for the recovery of the holy Land: And in
one word, in such admiration the Beast of <HI>Rome</HI> was, that it
was a Proverb among them, <HI>He ruled all the world;</HI> and there∣fore
he ruled all the Churches, and was esteemed to be God
on Earth: Thus did all the world wonder after the Beast, and
admire him, and so did they also hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> power: They did exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dingly
admire his power; <HI>Who is like unto the Beast? who is a∣ble
to make warre with him?</HI> It is not cleare adoration, but it is
an attributing to the Beast, that which is peculiar to God;
<HI>Who is like unto the Lord our God?</HI> Exod. 15. 11. It is a style of
the high and mighty God: This admiration of this wonder∣full
power and holinesse it is now added to the Pope: <HI>Who is
like unto the Beast? who is able to make warr with him? Who is the
Lord of hosts but our God?</HI> as if he were invincible: For they had
found, that when some of the Grecian Emperours that had
given their power to the Beast did vary in point of judgment
(as they did not love to take up the worship of Images) then
the Beast is offended, and excommunicates him, and deprives
him of his Empire, and gives it to <HI>Charles</HI> the Great; takes a∣way
the Kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> puts him into a Monastery, re∣moves
<HI>Fredericke,</HI> first and second: And what he did with
King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> you know; He deprived him of his
Kingdome, and hee makes some of them do very hard pe∣nance,
whiles he was solacing himselfe with his Harlot: She
being more compassionate then he, besought his Holinesse to
have compassion on him, and so he sent him back, yet after∣wards
they made him away: And his Son, when they came
to Crown him, it must be with the Popes foot; and when he
hath done, he dasheth it off, to shew, that he hath power to
take it as easily from him, as to fell it from his head. Though
great men, and greatly beloved of the people, all is nothing,
if they be alienated from the Pope: All mens affections are
his; when he turns, the whole body turns; when the head
moves, the whole body doth accordingly: So that it was
marvellous admirable power that he had; whom he would he
set up, and whom he would he pulled downe. <HI>Peter,</HI> he said,
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>
gave it to him, and he did what he would to those that were
on the earth, this is great power. They professe, if their ho∣ly
Father carry many millions of soules to Hell, yet no man
must say, Sir, why do you so: All appeals were from him, so
that there is transcendant, soveraign power, and indeed di∣vine,
such as no man can attaine; Power to pardon sin, pow∣er
to bind Conscience, to dispence with the Law of God, to
interpret and judg of Scripture as he sees cause, and this is
such power, as is far above the reach of man: None of them
all have such power as he, not those that are called Gods:
So they admire his power, what he can do to inward or out∣ward
man, to publique or private States. And they do not
only admire the Catholick Church, and the head of it, and
adore them; but in both these they adore the Dragon that
gave all this power to the Beast. The meaning may be exprest
in two branches.</P>
<P>1. The Dragon is expressed as animating heathen <HI>Rome,</HI>
for that hath seven heads and ten horns, which are the
armes, both of heathen <HI>Rome,</HI> and of this Beast: Now
he is called the Dragon, as he acted heathen <HI>Rome,</HI> and as
he was Lord of heathen <HI>Rome,</HI> he gave all this power to
the Pope; For they thought it meet, since it was the
Imperiall City when it was Pagan, that therefore it
should be the mother of all Churches: And being the
Imperial City, it was the bloud-sucker of many millions
of the souls of Gods servants, that caused the Dragon
to put that honour upon <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>2. But that is not all, There is another branch comes
neerer the full meaning of the Text; that was for the
honouring of the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and of the Catholick
Church, <HI>viz.</HI> taking another doctrine for the Gospell,
their Idolatry for pure worship, their Government for
the discipline of Christ, their pardons for Justification
of sinne by Christ; In all this they doe indeed give true
worship to the Dragon, for what are all these but Ima∣ges,
they are none of Gods Ordinances; if you referre
them to the heads of Scripture, they are but Images of
Christ; In stead of the Ministery of Christ, you have do∣ctrines
<PB N="54" REF="32"/>
of men; In stead of justification by the righteous∣nesse
of Christ, you have justification by works; In stead
of pardon of Sin from Christ, you have it from the Pope;
All things are in another forme, an Image of another
forme set up, devised, contrary to what the word esta∣blisheth:
Now you shall finde this to be true; if you doe
vary from the kingdome of God, and Christ, then you
worship the Dragon: You read in 2 <HI>Chron. 11. 15. Je∣roboam</HI>
ordained him Priests, for the high places, and for
the Devils, and for the Calves, which he had made: he
had no Preists but for the golden Calves, and what were
they? they were but Images, and his intendment was
not to bring in another object of worship, but another
manner of worship; <HI>Jeroboam</HI> worshiped Jehovah in I∣mages,
which God had not appointed, and so he wor∣shipped
the Divill, and not God. And you shall read,
when the <HI>Turke</HI> was brought in to revenge the Idolatry
of Christendome, <HI>Rev.</HI> 9. 20. It is said, <HI>The people that
were not cut off with the plague, they repented not of the worke
of their hands, that they should not worship Devils, and Idols of
Gold and Silver, and brasse, and Stone, and of wood, which nei∣ther
can see, nor hear, nor walk:</HI> which shews, that when
men worship Images, that is, God in Images; it is not
God that is so worshipped, but the Divill, and all such
worship doth not advance the kingdome of God, but
the kingdome of the Devill, therefore it is reall ho∣nour
to him: and therefore this their taking all this
vast honour (all Churches receiving all from them) is
none of Gods Institution, but the Devils practice, for
it was the Devill that gave him his power and great au∣thority;
Therefore saith the holy Ghost, <HI>they worshiped
the Dragon who gave power unto the Beast, and they worshipped
the beast:</HI> This worship of the beast they gave it all to him
that gave this power to him, which was to the Dragon;
and therfore you read that he had the key of the bottom∣lesse
pit, <HI>Rev. 9. 1, 2. And he opened the bottomlesse pit, and
there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great fur∣nace,
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth:</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
There went out Monks &amp; Friars, and a rabble of all su∣perstition.</P>
<P>Now if you shall aske the reason why people upon the hea∣ling
of this wound did so mightily admire both the visible
Catholick Church, and the head of it, and adore both, and
Satan himselfe in both? The reason was,</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> from the wrong Interpretation of some Scriptures,
which were very frequent with them in those dayes, and are
still; and that was, that the Catholick Roman Church was
builded upon a rock, and that rock was the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and into his hand the Lord Jesus by <HI>Peter</HI> had given the keys
of the kingdome of Heaven, and these keys had absolute uni∣versall
power to binde on Earth, and upon his binding on
earth, Christ would bind in heaven: this was an error in judg∣ment
that did so possesse their hearts, that upon the healing
of this wounded head, all the world did admire him: There∣fore
<HI>Bellarmine</HI> makes a large discourse; <HI>Behold, I lay in Zion
a chief corner stone, and they that trust in him shall never be confoun∣ded;</HI>
and so never was there any man that was an enemy to
the Catholick Church, but was confounded; nor never did
any man stand for the Catholick Church, but was preserved:
and so they did admire him; A great inundation of barba∣rous
Nations were all driven out by the piety of the Bishop
of <HI>Rome;</HI> they were able to overturn the Emperors of the
East (and it was overturned) and bring them to his feet, and
all to be at his disposing; This was some confirmation to
them, that he was the successor of <HI>Peter,</HI> that now whoever is
saved, it must be by the power of this key, or else never look
for any saving in this world.</P>
<P>A second reason may be taken from the correspondency
and plausablenesse of such a kinde of Religion and Govern∣ment
to carnall reason.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> especially when it is subdued by any
terrors of consceence: for it was a season (and that held
many years together) wherein the Priests, Friers, and Monks,
had marvellous power to sting the consciences of men with
the loathsomnesse of their sinne in the sight of God, and
they had admirable dexterity therein: These foure things
were all the matter of their Sermons, Vertue and vice, Heaven
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>
and Hell; If you be vertuous, then you shall go to Heaven;
If you be vicious, then you must go to Hell: Now they
would so convince mens consciences, and upon conviction
binde the conscience under terror, as eternally shut out of
Heaven, for want of virtue, which they had not; that indeed
when these mens consciences are thus perplexed and woun∣ded,
here is a Religion that findes them so many salves and
medicines, as ease the power, but not remove the cause of the
disease; that is, they set men a course; well, though you be
vicious, and though Hell be dreadfull, yet Purgatory may
ease you by Prayer, and you may be dispensed with from go∣ing
to Hell, especially by the Popes pardon, or by your own
workes, by your confessions, by selfe-whippings and scour∣gings,
or by going a Pilgrimage, you may be discharged of
this burden; This was very plausable to carnall reason, es∣pecially
if they gave so much to such a Monastery, that they
may offer so many Sacraments for them (for they look at the
bread in the Lords supper as a propiatory Sacrament:) here
were so many means to satisfie the consciences of those that
were superstitious, as nothing could be devised to give better
content to the spirits of men in those dayes: any man that
knowes it, shall finde it true, that when the conscience is ter∣rified
with the curse of Gods Law, and never shewed the true
way of fellowship with Christ, no man is so tender and con∣scionable
in the performance of all duties as they: If you
will have them kisse the Popes foot, or give so much to a
Monastery; and by this means Hell shall be shut against them,
and Purgatory discharged: But for assurance of Salvation
in Christ, they could not endure that; they that stood
for that, they tell them, what, you will not have men doe
good workes, away with that, faggot and halter for such
Hereticks.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> there was a third Reason, and that was from the
great reverence of all Councells, and Synods to the Sea of
<HI>Rome.</HI> The City of <HI>Rome</HI> had wont to be the imperiall City,
now in such a case as this they thought it but reasonable; In
heathenish <HI>Rome</HI> they gave all worship to them, and so let
Christian <HI>Rome</HI> give all their worship to the chief Head there,
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>
and so to their mother Church, all Catholicks would incou∣rage
others so to doe; and so by this means there were such
incouragements laid for admiration and adoration, that you
may not wonder at what the holy Ghost saith, <HI>That when the
wound was healed, all the world wondred after the beast, saying, who
is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</HI> Not
the Emperors of the East and West, not the King of <HI>England,
France, Spain,</HI> nor all that have been of greatest force, they
were none of them able to hold up their heads against this
great Beast. The use of this point is thus much;</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> you may observe from hence, that Universality,
and Prosperity, though they be given for two notes of a true
Church by the Papists, yet indeed they are but sopisticall, de∣ceitfull
delusions; They are not such marks of a Church as
are peculiar to a true Church; here is Universality, <HI>All the
world wondred after the beast;</HI> and here is Prosperity, all the
world adore, and admire the Beast; <HI>Who is like unto the beast?
who is able to make war with him?</HI> Not all the Princes of the
world: So that here is externall prosperity, for so they call
it; here are both these concur, and they doe indeed argue a
Catholick Church, as <HI>Bellarmine</HI> saith; but note this, that
Catholick Church which is visible, (which is the Roman vi∣sible
Catholick Church) the Scripture holds it forth as a
great, and ugly, and monstrous Beast: look not therefore at
these as any good marks and signes, by which Jesuites, and
Seminaries are wont to draw to deep devotion to the Ca∣tholick
Church, for all the world have run this way, there
is but a handfull, a few of such as are otherwise minded;
what is <HI>Genevah</HI> and some others to <HI>Rome?</HI> what have they
been able to doe in comparison of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
which is the Church of Churches, none have been able to doe
as they.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> we may see the danger of this admiration, and
adoration, the deadly and desperate danger of adoring the
Catholick visible Church and the Dragon. It is the cunning
of these Priests and Jesuites to draw men by all means to be
at least devoted to the Catholick Church, and to submit
their power thereunto; for they say there is no union with
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
Christ the head, unlesse you be united to the visible head on
Earth; this is their usuall plea: Now marke what the holy
Ghost speaks in this Text; he doth say, that all the worship
of this mother Church is but the worship of the Dragon.
Men are devoutly adicted to give up their souls to the Devill,
when they give up themselves to the Catholicke visible
Church, the Lord professeth he is not honoured by them;
they professe honour to he-Saints and shee-Saints, and dead
Saints, and to all relicks and remnants of them; the honour
of them is given unto the Devill, and not to God. That look
what <HI>Paul</HI> sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of heathen <HI>Rome, John</HI> speaks of christian
<HI>Rome; This I say,</HI> saith the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor. 10. 20. That the
things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to Devils, and not
to God; and I would not that ye should have fellowship with Devils;</HI>
And so this saith <HI>John</HI> the holy Apostle (equall to the Apo∣stle
<HI>Paul,</HI> or next him, but here guided equally with <HI>Paul</HI> in
the Authentical word of God) he saith, <HI>They that worship God
according to the prescript of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>they worship the
Devils, and not God; they worship the Dragon, the old Serpent.</HI> So
that it is not so light a matter as Gallants at Court, and great
Kings apprehend, they will be reconciled to their mother
Church, they will goe a Pilgrimage that is devised by the
Pope, and perform duties as their ghostly Father directs
them, and have their bead-prayers; In all this what do they
doe? This is a worship to the great beast, but this is the issue,
and substance of it, they doe indeed worship the Dragon; It
is not the Lord Jesus, nor God the Father, nor the blessed
spirit that is thus worshipped, but this is indeed the worship
of the Devill.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> this may serve to teach us, to blesse the name of
the Lord, that hath delivered us from this admiration and
adoration, from this wofull Captivity and Calamity where∣to
our Fathers have been enthralled; All those of them
<HI>whose names are not written in the Lambs book of life,</HI> they were
all led this way; and it is a marvellous deliverance that God
hath wrought for us in taking our Religion from universa∣lity,
and from outward prosperity. It is sometimes a snare
to Christians, this kinde of Government that we have, and
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
they are apt to say what doe any of the great Nations of the
world for worship and Government; did you ever know a∣ny
such thing authorised in any Kingdome? There is an in∣ward
principle in us by nature to doe as all the world doe:
what, are we more wise then they? It is a great temptation,
but we have cause to blesse God that hath wrought delive∣rance
for us; But what if all the world did worship the De∣vill,
as time was when they did? what if all the world wor∣ship
the Beast, and the Dragon that gave power to the Beast,
must we doe so? And as they are not grounds of our wor∣ship,
so they are fit grounds of unfeigned thankfulnesse to
God that hath delivered us from that Religion by which all
the world was bewitched to give their Crownes, Honours,
Bodies, and States to the devotion of the visible Catholick
Church, and to the head of that Church: It is cause of ever∣lasting
thankfulnesse and watchfulnesse, not to be deluded
by fine shewes of worldly men, but let us see and know where
true worship lies, as the Lord hath declared himself in Christ,
and held him forth in the Gospel of truth.</P>
<P>Forthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> let it teach us all where to bestow our admira∣tion,
and adoration; It was a charge that our Saviour gave
to the Devill, (and which accordingly he himself practised,
and requires us to doe) <HI>Mat. 4. 10. Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve:</HI> The Devill askes this
of Christ to bow downe to him and worship him; The Lords
Indignation is kindled, his holy Zeale is inflamed against
such a Sacriligious request; <HI>Get thee hence Satan, for it is writ∣ten,
thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou
serve.</HI> And as we are to worship him alone, and no God but
him, so we are to admire none but him; <HI>Who is like unto thee,
O Lord amongst the Gods? who is like unto thee, glorious in holi∣nesse,
fearfull in praises, doing wonders,</HI> Exod. 15. 11. There is
matter of admiration; <HI>who is a God like unto the Lord that for∣giveth
Iniquity, Transgression and Sinne;</HI> of which you read, <HI>Mic.</HI>
7. 18. and which the Church holds forth there upon this very
ground: <HI>who is a God like unto thee?</HI> why what is there in him
that you so magnifie him? <HI>he is a God that forgives Iniquity,
Transgression, and Sinne;</HI> here is cause indeed of admiration.
<PB N="60" REF="35"/>
They admire and adore the Pope, why? Because they had sa∣tisfaction
to their consciences in their way, and an ungroun∣ded
hope of a better state in another world, and pardon of
Sinne in this, and now they come to fellowship with Christ
by the worship of the Devill: <HI>But who is a God like unto thee
that pardoneth Iniquity, Transgression, and Sinne?</HI> So that here is
indeed matter of due admiration, and let it be fastned there.
When a mans soul is brought low with the sence of Sinne,
and overpoured with the burden that lyes upon his consci∣ence
by reason of the guilt of Sinne; what is matter of ad∣miration
now? <HI>who is a God like unto thee, that passeth by Iniqui∣ty,
transgression, &amp; sin?</HI> It is not the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> that can take
away sin, it is not all the cunning of the Dragon that can do
it: And therefore to what end are all the admirations, and
worships that are put upon the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> and the Dra∣gon
that gave him his power? They may please themselves
in what satisfaction they apprehend they have, but their own
principles possesse them, that they can never come to see the
admirable goodnesse of God in forgiving their Sinnes. But
now when the Lord sheds abroad a spirit of grace and peace
in the conscience, and applyes the goodnesse of Christ to the
discharge of the burden of Sinne, and of quickning the heart
in the peace of Christ Jesus, this breeds admiration: <HI>Blessed
be God the Father of mercy, and God of all consolation, that of his a∣boundant
mercy hath begotten us again to a lively hope:</HI> I say this
blessing is worthy of admiration, and not onely of wonder∣ment,
but of acknowledging all glory and blessednes to him.
When the conscience is not pacified by a sorry duty done
from man, but by a sealed pardon from the spirit of God,
witnessed by the breath of the holy Ghost; this is such a
mercy to the soule; as indeed raiseth the heart above all ad∣miration
of such a Beast, I, to a true detestation of this Beast,
and of the Dragon that hath so long bewitched, and carried
them captive to the imaginations of their own hearts, and in
the end to their everlasting perdition. But let it be the care
of Gods people, as ever you desire to be blessed from the ad∣miration
of such a worm-eaten Religion, so grow to an ad∣miration
of the God of mercy and grace: and so we shall
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
doe that upon just grounds, which our Fathers did without
grounds, to this Beast, and to the head of it. Upon this
ground, this head being wounded, and afterwards healed, all
the world wondred after him: Here is an Image of Christ,
<HI>he was wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed:</HI> and he
riseth againe, and he proclaims all power is given him, in
Heaven and Earth; Now see how this Vicar of Christ (as
they call him) usurps; as Christ was wounded, and is risen
againe; so it is with this Beast, he is wounded to death, and
afterwards healed and restored, and now all the world ad∣mire
and worship him: Have they forgotten that <HI>Christ dyed
for our Sinnes, and was raised again for our Justification?</HI> and doe
they stand admiring at this Beast as he that was wounded, and
healed? Therefore let it be a ground of true thankfulnesse to
the Lord, for the great change that is wrought in Christen∣dome,
and let us give the Lord the admiration that is due to
him, that we may be preserved from those delusions, where∣with
others have been deceived and may goe on in this way
constantly which the Lord hath established, and called us un∣to.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Revel. 13. 5, 6.</BIBL>
<Q><P>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great
things, and blasphemies, and power was given unto him
to continue forty and two moneths.</P>
<P>And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to
blaspheme his name, and his Tabernacle, and them that
dwell in heaven.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE events that followed upon the healing of the Beast;
the first was, <HI>That all the world admired him.</HI> The second
was, <HI>Ʋniversall worship given both to the Beast, and to the Dragon
that gave power to the Beast,</HI> of which wee have already spoken.
The third event remains now to be spoken to, and that is,
the deligation of power to this Beast, upon his recovery, and
the power given him is four-fold.</P>
<P>1. There was power given him to speak great things, and
in particular, great blasphemies.</P>
<P>2. <HI>There was power given him to continue,</HI> that is, as the word
signifies, to be doing, to be active, to be powerfull and effica∣cious
in his worke 42. moneths.</P>
<P>3. There was power given him to make war with the Saints, and
to overcome them.</P>
<P>4. Power was given him of dominion over all Kindreds, Tongues,
and Nations.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> There was given him a mouth speaking great things.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>There was power given him to continue 42. moneths,</HI>
and both these Authorities or Liberties, they are amplified
by the effect it wrought in the Beast: He did effectually take
that power which was given him, and employed it to the ut∣most.
As he had a mouth given him, so he opened his mouth
in blasphemies, and that amplified by the object of his blas∣phemy
against God, and God distributed, his Name, his Ta∣bernacle,
and those that dwell in Heaven. The note then that
the words do afford first, is this.</P>
<P>That after the healing of the wounded head of the Beast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctr. 1.</NOTE> there was
given to him power to speak great things, even blasphemies, which
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
also he did effectually and abundantly exercise, or put forth.</P>
<P>For so it is here said, <HI>There was given him a mouth speaking
great things and blasphemies,</HI> and he opened his mouth accor∣dingly,
abundantly against God, and against his name, and
his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven: Every thing
of God he did with open mouth blaspheme.</P>
<P>Let me a little open the words, and the Doctrine, for the
doctrine is in a manner the words of the Text.</P>
<P><HI>There was given him a mouth.]</HI> what mouth had he more
then other men? The meaning is, he had such liberty of
speech as no man had; <HI>There was given him liberty, and power,
and authority to speak great things.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Given him.]</HI> by whom?</P>
<P>1. It was given him by God in his just judgment that gave
up men to efficacy of delusions, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. 11.</P>
<P>2. It was given him by Satan, in the efficacy of whose
power Antichrist comes, <HI>with all deceivablenesse of unrighteous∣nesse,</HI>
2 Thes. 2. 9, 10.</P>
<P>3. It was given him by the generall consent of Princes and
States Ecclesiasticall and Civill. In Ecclesiasticall Councels,
great was the authority that was given him, none of all them
thought themselves equall to him: And for the Civill State,
God put it into their hearts to give their power and Throne
unto the beast, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 17.</P>
<P>What power did they give him to speak great things, and
in particular blasphemies? It is an allusion to the horn in
<HI>Dan. 2. 8. There came up a little horne which had a mouth speaking
great things;</HI> whether it be the same Beast, or a type of him, I
will not now stand to determine, but great things he spoke;
as indeed this was a great thing that the Catholick Church
had power to speak, for he did open his mouth to speak
great things, that is, such things, as for other men to speake,
were too great arrogance, and too much affectation of inor∣dinate
Vain-glory; but for this Church, or the head of it
to speak, they had a mouth given for the same purpose.</P>
<P><HI>And Blasphemies.]</HI> They make many distinctions in Schools
of Blasphemies, which I will not trouble you with: they
may be brought to two heads, either in attributing to God
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
something unworthy of him, things incompatible to his di∣vine
nature, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 29. It is blasphemy to ascribe to
God likenesse of four-footed beasts, or creeping things, and
the like. Or otherwise, if you attribute to the Creature that
which properly doth belong to God, you hurt the name of
God, and crush it when you so speak. Now what is it for
the Beast to open his mouth, to speak great things and blas∣phemies?
The phrase is very significant in the Hebrew: It im∣plies
three things.</P>
<P>1. That a man speaks upon the meditation: He opens his
mouth to speak, that is to say, he hath something to say, and
power to deliver it, and he sets himselfe of purpose to speak
it: <HI>I will open my mouth in wisdome, and the meditation of my heart
shall be of understanding,</HI> Psal. 49. 3, 4. He tells you of his me∣ditation,
and then he will open his mouth, and declare it.</P>
<P>2. To open the mouth implies an audable, and full, and
bold, and confident expression of a mans minde, that a man
doth not whisper, but lift up his voyce, and declare with o∣pen
mouth what he hath to deliver; as in <HI>Exod. 3. 23. Open
thy mouth and tell them,</HI> that is, speak boldly: Though they be
a rebellious People, and will brow-beate thee, <HI>yet open thy
mouth, and speake unto them;</HI> speak boldly, and confidently, as
one that goes not behind the door, but speaks plainly: And
I put in plainly with boldnesse, because they are ever conco∣mitants.
If a man speak boldly, he doth not extenuate what
he hath to deliver, but speaks it plainly.</P>
<P>3. This opening of the mouth doth imply that hee speaks
fully and abundantly, his heart was full of it, and he doth ac∣cordingly
powr out that which he delivers: As <HI>Elihu</HI> tells
you in <HI>Job 32. 18, 19, 20. I am full of matter, the spirit within
me constraineth me: Behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent,
it is ready to burst like new bottles,</HI> &amp;c. So the meaning is this,
That as the Pope saw (which was the head of this Beast) that
he had a mouth given him; that is, uncontrollable liberty to
speak what he would: He did not sodainly or rashly speake,
some inconsiderate, or erroneous, or arrogant speech which
he did eate in againe; but he spake advisedly in his grave and
considerate Councell, upon advised judgment he did speak
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>
great things and blasphemies: And this he did plainly and
boldly, not in ambiguous or obscure phrases, but plainly
in such expressions as could beare no other meaning; and
that with such confidence, that you may see he cared not
who heard, nor what Construction might be made of it.
And this he did, not in a word or two that dropped from
him, but as flowing from him; Hee was full of matter, as
2 <HI>Cor. 6. 11. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is
enlarged.</HI> He did poure forth his matter with no little State;
it was stout matter that he did poure forth to the world.
What did hee speake? that which was given him to speake.
What was that? <HI>Great things.</HI> As for instance, to sum up the
great things he speaks: The Catholick Roman Church in
Scripture is accounted <HI>the mother of Harlots, and abomination of
the earth,</HI> Rev. 17. 5. There is not such an adulterous Church
in the world.</P>
<P>1. And yet is not this a great word and a great blasphmy,
for the mother of Harlots to hold forth her selfe as the only
immaculate Spouse of Christ upon the face of the Earth? Is
not this a grand word for a common Harlot, the mother of
Harlots, the lewdest Harlot that ever the earth bore, for her
to arrogate this stile as the only Church of Christ? And
that which is parallel to this, that the Pope (who is the head
of this Beast) is the head and Husband of this Church, and is
without controule: He hath a mouth given him, and he is
not ashamed to speak great things, and blasphemies.</P>
<P>2. It is a great word to make himselfe the infallible Inter∣preter,
and absolute judge of Scriptures, that cannot erre
in derision, or determination of any controversies of Religi∣on;
nor may it be for any mortall man to controll his judg∣ment
nor practice.</P>
<P>In Judgment he cannot erre: in practice, though he may
erre, yet other men may be judged; but God hath put such
an uncontrollable power upon him, as he thinks that none
may meddle with him; Though he should carry millions of
soules to Hell, yet no man must say, Sir, why do you so:
Councels may not judge, Princes may not judge, inferiour
States may not judge him, all the world may not judge him;
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
He stands and falls to the Canonists, his owne well-studied
Canonists have so determined it: A great word to be infalli∣ble
judge of Scripture, and to be uncontrollable; it is a great
matter, and greater then any man can reach unto: Never did
any earthly Prince challenge that he could not erre, nor that
none must controll him if he did: There have been Laws made
to controll the greatest Princes: <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was taught
to be controlled, that in the end <HI>Shadrach, Mesech,</HI> and <HI>Abed∣nego</HI>
goe away rewarded,</P>
<P>3. The Catholick Church, and the Pope is the head of it,
claimes a power of binding and loosing. To bind mens con∣sciences
by his Laws, and to loose mens consciences by his
Indulgences, and that not ministerially, as Ministers do from
the Word, but by a Juditiary power, to dissolve the bond of
naturall Obedience, incestuous Marriages, Oaths and Co∣venants
in Marriage; Natural relations between Parents and
Children, and morall Relations between Princes and Sub∣jects:
There is not any bond that he cannot loose, nor any
liberty which he cannot restraine: And this not over a few
only, but over the vast world so far as it is Christian. And</P>
<P>4. It is a great thing he speakes (and he speakes it not be∣hind
the door) when he challengeth Soveraign dominion
(in way of advancement of Religion) over all Kingdoms, so
as to depose their Kings, and dispose of their Kingdoms, leave
any State to choose where he hath power: If his Crowne be
to be fetched from <HI>Rome</HI> (as it was in former times when it
was most active) He will set it on, but dash it off againe, out
of the plentitude of his power, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et up and throw downe at
his pleasure. He opened his mouth to speak great things; He
is never so in his element as when he doth hold forth such vast
authority, and divine propriety, proper to the Father, Son,
and holy Ghost.</P>
<P>Now as he speaks great things, so blasphemes against God,
and wherein? <HI>Against his Name, and Tabernacle, and them that
dwell in heaven. Against his name:</HI> All these are blasphemies a∣gainst
Gods name, to attribute all these divine properties to a
beastly man, to a great beast. And it is blasphemy to ascribe
any divine honour, or to put it upon any creature: Images
<PB N="67" REF="38"/>
served, the holy Ghost calls blasphemy. <HI>Isa. 65. 7. You have
blasphemed me upon every green hill.</HI> And in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20. 27, 28.
he complaines of the like blasphemy, <HI>that they blasphemed him
by their Idolatires.</HI> In <HI>Mar. 2. 7. Why doth this man speak blasphe∣mies?
who can forgive sins but God onely?</HI> It were to speak blas∣phemy
in any but in Christ.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>It is against his Tabernacle;</HI> that may be either
meant the body of Christ, as 1 <HI>John 14. He tabernacled amongst
us.</HI> Or it may be meant the visible Churches, such as are insti∣tuted
by him. For the body of Christ, it is blasphemy to go
to every Masse Priest, to make him the body and blood of
our Saviour. Or if you understand the Tabernacle to be the
Church; that is the Temple of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 16. Now to
call the Church of Christ a Conventicle of Hereticks and
Schismaticks, it is blasphemy, and so they count all the
Churches here: And for the Saints in heaven, to put upon
them divine worship, to build Temples to them, to put up
Prayers to them, to keep Holy-dayes to them, it is blasphe∣mie
to them, it is a great dishonour. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI>
when they saw men to come and offer sacrifice to them, <HI>Men
and brethren why doe you these things?</HI> you cannot do us a grea∣ter
injury. And for the Saints in heaven, that is, pure Chur∣ches,
he condemns them for Hereticks, and Schismaticks, and
as unworthy of Christian communion, and Christian burial,
these are blasphemies: So you see the meaning of this Scrip∣ture;
<HI>There was given him a mouth to speake great things, and to
blaspheme God, in his Name, in his Tabernacle, in those that dwell in
Heaven:</HI> Thus hath he done many yeares, and thus doth hee
still.</P>
<P>Now for the reason of the point; you see the point stands
upon two branches.</P>
<P>1. That such power was given him.</P>
<P>2. That he did effectually and abundantly put it fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h, <HI>He
opened his mouth:</HI> Let mee give the reasons of both. 1. Why
such power was given him; it was</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> from God, in his just judgement to punish the un∣thankfull
world that received not the love of the truth,
<HI>Therefore the Lord gave them over to efficacy of delusions to believe
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>
lies; That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
had pleasure in unrighteousnesse,</HI> 2 Thes. 2. 10, 11. This is the
just judgment of God, that since they refused the simplicity
of wholsome Doctrine, and had itching eares, they should
have such men as came with the subduing word of the Law to
speak great things, and they should have what they aske; This
is from Gods just jugement.</P>
<P>A second Reason is from Satan;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> for God concurred, and
Satan concurred, and Christian Princes concurred herein:
Satan concurred for this reason, that he might be avenged of
God, and despight the name of Christ, that had cast him out,
and dethroned him from his divine power: That whereas he
was the great God of the world, and the God of Israel but a
puny God of the lesser Nations; now hee is to be no God to
trust on, but like a Toad or Serpent; this doth so enrage the
venome of the old Devill, that he powrs forth a flood of ma∣lice
and venome against the Church and Christ, as much as
may be, to testifie to the world hee would be Lord, and the
Lord Jesus should not prevaile: And if he may not be God,
he will set up a Beast that shall be adored as God: And it is a
great despight to Christ, to advance a Beast, that shall carry
great State and power, and dare, and will speak greater
things then all the Churches of Christ, I, as great as the
Lord himself shall speak; look what one speaks, the other wil
speak it all, and speak it abundantly: As the Devill himselfe
sometimes said to Christ, <HI>All these will I give thee, if thou wilt
fall downe and worship me.</HI> The same doth he speak at this day,
and he will speak without controll.</P>
<P>Another reason that binds Satan so to speak, is not only
his old enmity to Christ, but from his malice against the
Church. When hee saw that the seed of the woman had thus
dethroned him, and cast him out of divine power, he powrs
forth a flood of malice after her, and he sends forth an ugly
Beast, that if he can, may root out the face of Christianity,
and root her out from the face of the earth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. 15.
These are the Devils reasons that mooved him to stirre up the
Beast, and to give him a mouth to speake so boldly as hee
did.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="39"/>
But why will Christian Princes be so prodigall, to submit
themselves to him? God had committed to them the care of
the Churches, that all Churches should live peaceably and
quietly under them, in all godliness and honesty: why would
they so degenerate, and suffer the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> so to arro∣gate
and speak such great blasphemies? The reasons were,</P>
<P>1. Because they were ignorantly blinde;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> It was a time
of palpable darknesse, darknesse that might be felt: From the
ninth Centuary to the tenth, both Protestant and Popish Di∣vines
complaine, that had not some lived in the 800. year,
and in the thousand yeare after Christ, they should not have
known what had beene done in the nine hundred, a whole
hundred years together: Men were so full of darknesse and
ignorance, that scarce any set pen to paper to tell us what
was done in those dark times; that men did not know what
were principles of Christianity, much lesse were able to dis∣cern
of Cases of Church-government, or the misterie of god∣linesse
which requires more diligent attendance: And thence
it was that they were so taken with the pretended claymes of
the Catholick visible Church, that it would not erre, because
it was built upon a Rock, and had the keys of <HI>Peter,</HI> and he
had the keys of heaven: <HI>What he bound on earth was bound in hea∣ven;
and what he loosed on earth was loosed in heaven;</HI> that had
there not been palpable grosse ignorance, it had not been pos∣sible
such grosse things should have been suffered to come in.</P>
<P>And a second thing that moved them was the strange suc∣cesse
of the Beast in recovering of his wounded head;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> for that
made them wonder after the Beast, when they saw such a mor∣tall
wound so throughly healed: They thought, had it not
been above the power of mortall men, it had not been possible
it should have been healed, but certainly there was a power
above mortall men in it, and that is the reason in the Text
to give him a mouth to speak great things, to speak what hee
would.</P>
<P>And a third reason why Princes gave this power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> was their
devout superstition; many were convinced by Matchivilian
policy, of their great sins, and they had in those dayes a no∣table
dexterity to apply the Law of God, and to sting mens
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>
consciences like a Cockatrice, <HI>Rev.</HI> 9. 5. and then they would
do any thing for ease out of the bondage they lay under, and
this was a great meanes: Then they directed them to give so
much to such a Monastery, or to goe a Pilgrimage, or fast
such a time, and such devotion which a mans own unsancti∣fied
heart could reach: That when this Beast speaks great
things, that he can pardon sinne, and his Shavelings will take
a course for redeeming souls, and preserving them out of hel,
this was such satisfaction to them, that you need not wonder
if all Princes gave their Kingdomes to the Beast: And so ha∣ving
advanced him as supream over them all, he hath a mouth
he may speak what he will; Princes may make Laws on this
hand or on that; but if they do not suite with him, they are
disannulled: And they must be reconciled to the mother
Church, and so this Harlot gives them all to her, and hath
a mouth speaking great things, and therewithall great blas∣phemie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>Thus have you the point, and the reasons of it.</P>
<P>For the use of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> I might from hence first speak to this
point; that it were therefore a necessary counsell to all Ro∣man
Catholicks, to consider diligently the grounds of the
great priviledges of the visible Catholick Church, they
stretch their authority beyond all degrees of Churches, be∣yond
all Temporall States or particular Churches: Now ne∣cessary
it were for them to reverse all the great things which
are delivered, and which the Pope hath set open his mouth
to speak, though they be delivered with never such fulnesse,
and boldnesse, and plentitude of power: It behoves men to
consider whether all these great words be not the words of a
Beast, and blasphemies which the head of the Beast had taken
upon him to utter, for it is not enough that they are spoken
boldly and confidently, and with good advisement and grave
Counsell, Provinciall Decretals and Decrees, for they are
distinct things: It behoves Catholicks not to be gulled with
Titles and great things; for it is not alwayes that power
which God in mercy gives to men when they dare speak great
things; they think the Pope is not Antichrist; but when An∣tichrist
comes, <HI>will he do greater things then these?</HI> as they sayd
<PB N="71" REF="40"/>
of Christ; <HI>when Christ comes will he doe greater workes then these?</HI>
And so when Antichrist comes can he speak grater things
then these? And if I were to speak to Lay-men (as they say)
in their Religion, I might advise them to take heed they be
not taken with the confidence of their Priests, that speak with
good advisement even to impudency, and with such resolute
courage, that many thousands are carryed away with it,
and say, certainly men would never be so bold, if they were
not possessed with the goodnesse of their cause: Let them not
be deluded, the Beast hath power to speak great things, and
he opens his mouth with all courage and confidence, and
whispers it not, but speaks with impudency, and abundance
of resolution.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> This may serve to teach us the danger of allow∣ing
to any mortall man an inordinate measure of power to
speak great things, to allow to any man uncontroll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bleness
of speech, you see the desperate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ger of it: Let all the world
learn to give mortall men no greater power then they are
content they shall use, for use is they will: and unlesse they
be better taught of God, they will use it ever and anon, it
may be make it the passage of their proceeding to speake what
they will: And they that have liberty to speak great things,
you will finde it to be true, they will speak great blasphe∣mies.
No man would think what desperate deceit and wick∣ednesse
there is in the hearts of men: And that was the reason
why the Beast did speak such great things, hee might speak,
and no body might controll him: What, saith the Lord in
<HI>Jer. 3. 5. Thou hast spoken and done evill things as thou couldst.</HI> If
a Church or head of a Church could have done worse, he
would have done it: This is one of the straines of nature, it
affects boundlesse liberty, and to runne to the utmost extent:
What ever power he hath received, he hath a corrupt nature
that will improve it in one thing or other; if he have liberty,
he will think why may he not use it. Set up the Pope as Lord
Paramount over Kings and Princes, and they shall know
that he hath power over them, he will take liberty to depose
one, and set up another. Give him power to make Laws, and
he will approve, and disprove as he list; what he approves is
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>
Canonicall, what hee disproves is rejected: Give him that
power, and he will so order it at length, he will make such
a State of Religion, that he that so lives and dyes shall never
be saved, and all this springs from the vast power that is gi∣ven
to him, and from the deep depravation of nature. Hee
will open his mouth, <HI>His tongue is his owne, who is Lord over
him,</HI> Psal. 12. 3, 4. It is therefore most wholsome for Magi∣strates
and Officers in Church and Common-wealth, never
to affect more liberty and authority then will do them good,
and the People good; for what ever transcendant power is
given, will certainly over-run those that give it, and those
that receive it: There is a straine in a mans heart that will
sometime or other runne out to excesse, unlesse the Lord re∣straine
it, but it is not good to venture it: It is necessary
therefore, that all power that is on earth be limited, Church-power
or other: If there be power given to speak great things,
then look for great blasphemies, look for a licentious abuse of
it. It is counted a matter of danger to the State to limit Pre∣rogatives;
but it is a further danger, not to have them limi∣ted:
They will be like a Tempest, if they be not limited: A
Prince himselfe cannot tell where hee will confine himselfe,
nor can the people tell: But if he have liberty to speak great
things, then he will make and unmake, say and unsay, and
undertake such things as are neither for his owne honour, nor
for the safety of the State.<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞ Note.</NOTE> It is therefore fit for every man to
be studious of the bounds which the Lord hath set: and for
the People, in whom fundamentally all power lyes, to give
as much power as God in his word gives to men: And it is
meet that Magistrates in the Common-wealth, and so Offi∣cers
in Churches should desire to know the utmost bounds of
their own power, and it is safe for both: All intrenchment
upon the bounds which God hath not given, they are not
enlargements, but burden and snares; They will certainly
lead the spirit of a man out of his way sooner or later. It is
wholsome and safe to be dealt withall as God deales with the
vast Sea; <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, but there shalt thou stay thy
proud waves:</HI> and therefore if they be but banks of simple sand,
they will be good enough to check the vast roaring Sea. And
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>
so for Imperiall Monarchies, it is safe to know how far their
power extends; and then if it be but banks of sand, which is
most slippery, it will serve, as well as any brazen wall. If you
pinch the Sea of its liberty, though it be walls of stone or
brasse, it will beate them downe: So it is with Magistrates,
stint them where God hath not stinted them, and if they were
walls of brasse, they would beate them downe, and it is meet
they should: but give them the liberty God allows, and if it
be but a wall of sand it will keep them: As this liquid Ayre
in which we breath, God hath set it for the waters of the
Clouds to the Earth; It is a Firmament, it is the Clouds, yet
it stands firme enough, because it keeps the Climate where
they are, it shall stand like walls of brasse: So let there be due
bounds set, and I may apply it to Families; it is good for
the Wife to acknowledg all power and authority to the Hus∣band,
and for the Husband to acknowledg honour to the
Wife, but still give them that which God hath given them,
and no more nor lesse: Give them the full latitude that God
hath given, else you will finde you dig pits, and lay snares,
and cumber their spirits, if you give them lesse: there is never
peace where full liberty is not given, nor never stable peace
where more then full liberty is granted: Let them be duely
observed, and give men no more liberty then God doth, nor
women, for they will abuse it: The Devill will draw them,
and Gods providence leade them thereunto, therefore give
them no more then God gives. And so for children; and ser∣vants,
or any others you are to deale with, give them the li∣berty
and authority you would have them use, and beyond
that stretch not the tether, it will not tend to their good nor
yours: And also from hence gather, and goe home with this
meditation; That certainly here is this distemper in our na∣tures,
that we cannot tell how to use liberty, but wee shall
very readily corrupt our selves: Oh the bottomlesse depth of
sandy earth! of a corrupt spirit, that breaks over all bounds,
and loves inordinate vastnesse; that is it we ought to be care∣full
of.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> it may teach us to observe the hand of God in
all the vast out-runings of the Sonnes of men: when you see
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>
men outragious beyond all power, wonder not at the matter,
<HI>for he that is above is higher then the highest, and he regardeth it,
Eccles.</HI> 5. 8. A man would wonder that a Bishop should take
upon him to controul all the Churches, and in very deed all
the Common-wealths and Nations of the world, and that in
such high things both in nature and measure, that a man
would think it were not possible for a mortall man to under∣take
such a vast enterprize, yet they have done it, the Pope
hath done it, and the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> hath done it, but won∣der
not at it, <HI>for he that is higher then the highest hath given him
this power,</HI> John 3. 27. not given it him in an Ordinance, but
in his common Providence; This transcendant power that
he is able to carry all before him without controll; it is a
strange power, he may say what he will, and doe what he
will, for so many moneths, the time indeed is limited. So
that it will be of this use to us, if we see men outrageous,
and break bonds beyond measure is any common-wealth or
Church, our way is to see Gods hand in it, and to look up
to him to muzzle that power: He is able to bridle the high
King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> that whereas he spake great things, what is
the God of <HI>Israel</HI> that he shall deliver you out of my hand;
the Lord can put a bridle in his nostrills and bring him back
the way that he came. And therefore when men speak great
things against us, from any part of the world, know, that he
that is higher then the highest regardeth, and our eyes must
be to him, that he will muzzle such, and take order to cut
them off. <HI>The Lord will cut out the tongue that speaketh proud
things,</HI> Psal. 12. 4. He hath promised to doe it, and he will
doe it effectually. You have two places where the Lord
useth the word to <HI>muzzle,</HI> the one is about the Sea, <HI>Marke</HI> 4.
39. the other is spoken to the Devill, <HI>Mark 1. 25. Hold thy
peace,</HI> it is translated; but the word in the Originall is, <HI>be
thou muzzled: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that
treadeth out the Corne;</HI> it is the same word: It shews that the
Lord hath a muzzle for the great Sea, and a muzzle for the
Devils of hell, when we have to deal with them: If it be the
great King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> he will put his bridle in his nostrils,
and make him return back the same way he came: the Lord
<PB N="75" REF="42"/>
is above all; when they are above the reach of men, they are
not above him; he sits in heaven, <HI>and laughs them to scorn.</HI>
Those that have been most insolent in blaspheming, all Tur∣kish
or Popish blasphemies, the Lord will muzzle them: In
the mean time it it our part to sanctifie his name that gives
this vast liberty, that for so long they shall speak great things,
and no longer.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> it may teach us that there is a pronenesse in our
natures, to abuse all the providences of God, whether of spe∣ciall
mercies, or speciall judgements; and it warns us to be∣ware
of the same, in the enjoyment of any mercy, or in fee∣ling
of any stroak of God upon us: Here was this Beast, so
wounded in one of his heads, as it seemed to be deadly; he
was again healed: The Lord visits this Church with a dead∣ly
blow, by acts of his justice; and he also visits it with great
deliverances, and acts of his mercifull providence, and when
he hath done, see his great admiration, and adoration,
would you not think this should melt the heart of a Beast?
<HI>but the Oxe knowes his owner,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>and the Asse his ma∣sters
crib, but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider,</HI> Isa.
13. Though this deadly wound be healed, to the admiration
of the world, yet consider what little use he makes of it;
when he gives him power to doe what he will, what doth he?
He opens his mouth to speak great things, and blasphemies,
and he makes war with all the Saints of Heaven: he doth
much abuse his glory. He was knocked on the head, because
he would affect such vast Authority to be <HI>Pontefex Maximus;</HI>
the Lord cracked his Crown, breaks the head of this enemy,
and wounds the hairy scalpe of such as go on in wickedness:
He heals him again, and gives him great power; but what
doth he with it? He abuseth it against God, and against the
Church of God, and speaks great things, even blasphemies:
So there is a nature in us that will abuse every mercy of God,
to the corrupting of our hearts, and every judgment of God,
and every deliverance from that judgement; one would not
think what wofull distempers there are in our natures. If a
body be stuft with choller, it will turne the whole body to
feed the humour: So it is with us, we turne all the provi∣dences
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>
of God into distempers and outragious licentious∣nesse.</P>
<P>But you will say, he was a Beast, and the Church a Beast;
we hope Christians shall do better.</P>
<P>See it in <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> when the Lord had wrought great de∣liverances
for him, brought the Sunne ten degrees back, and
avenged him of his Enemies; afterwards he recovered him
from sicknesse, when his soule was brought to the jaws of
death: yet when the Princes of <HI>Babylon</HI> sent to him to en∣quire
of the wonder, that was done in the Land, God left
him to try him, that he might know what was in his heart,
and then he shews them his great Treasures, and works, and
fortifications, that he had throughout his Kingdome: and
it is said, <HI>He rendred not according to the benefits done unto him,
for his heart was lifted up, 2 Chron.</HI> 32. 25. 31. You see good
<HI>Hezekiah</HI> is apt to forget sicknesse: It argues the depth of
the body of Sinne which is not onely in wicked men (such
as these proud Prelats be) but in the Godly, in those that are
most eminent in Grace, they are not able to bear great Sailes;
if God shews us mercy and judgement, it is a wonder to see
what poore work we make.</P>
<P>Many a carnall heart will say, if he be delivered from sick∣nesse,
or if he be at Sea in danger, if he get a shore; or if in
Prison, if he get but liberty, God and men shall see what a
new man he will be: O the bottomlesse depth of a deceitfull
heart! let the Lord chastise us, and raise us up again, we for∣get
our humiliation, and grow to exaltation; and if God
helpe us a little, we grow to such out-runings of spirit as we
exceed therein: no gift that a man hath, no ordinance of
God, but he will thus abuse. And therefore we have cause
to sit down in dust and ashes, that we should abuse such mer∣cies
as we dayly partake in.</P>
<P>Fiftly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse 5.</NOTE> since this is the nature of wicked men, let God give
them but liberty, and men give them liberty, and they will
take it to the full: let God give a mouth, he will speak great
things; and if he have liberty to speak great things, he will
speak great blasphemies, against God, and his Tabernacle,
and the Saints: Then this will be a shame to Godly men, if
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>
the Lord give us great things, a mouth to speak all the good
we can, and liberty to do all the good we can, if we doe not
open our mouths and hearts to be speaking and doing all
the good we can; It is not for us to stand snorting out the
time which God hath carved out for us, but if a beast have
this liberty; if you tether a Beast at night, he knows the
length of his tether before morning; he will goe to the end
of it before he have done: And you see this Bishop the head
of the Church, if God give him a mouth, he will open it:
wicked men will take the utmost bounds of their liberty;
will wicked men doe so? why should not the children of God
then, and all that fear his name take the like care to improve
all their liberties, and power to doe all the good we can?
doth God give a liberty for laying foundations, for establi∣shing
jurisdictions, and liberty for well ordering our Fami∣lies
and Town-ships; if the Lord give us opportunities, why
should we want a heart to improve them? If the Beast hath
a heart to improve his wickednesse to the utmost, why
should not we improve all our Talents to Gods best advan∣tage,
to make it our whole study to doe all which the Lord
requires, that so we may bear plentifull witnesse in our Ge∣nerations
to all the liberties the Lord hath betrusted us with.
It is not for men that have received five Talents, that is to
say, five opportunities, to render to God as those that have
received but one or two; <HI>To whom much is given of them will
much be required,</HI> Luke 12. 48. And therefore is behooves us
all, as to know the liberties of Church &amp; Common-wealth,
so to set hand and affection a work to be doing all the good
we can: If it were the Beast, take a patterne from him (but
they must go fast that the Devils drives) he would improve
all his liberty: And why should they not goe fast whom
the Spirit of God drives, and improve the liberty they
have of God. And therefore it is for us to doe all the good
we can, and to leave nothing to those that shall come after
us, but to walk in the righteous steps of their fore-Fathers.
And therefore let us not leave, nor give rest to our eyes, till
in Family, Church, and Common-wealth we have set a pat∣terne
of holinesse to those that shall succeed us.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="44"/>
Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse 6.</NOTE> it may teach us a reverend use of the things of
God, for all Blasphemy against the name of God, or h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Tabernacle, or those that dwell in heaven, it is blasphemy
against God. It is said here, there was power given to the
Beast to speak great things, and blasphemyes: wherein did
that lye? against Gods name, and against his Tabernacle,
and those that dwell in Heaven: So that blaspheme any of
these, and you blaspheme God: blaspheme the name of
God, the Tabernacle of God, and those that dwell in Hea∣ven,
whether Saints above, or Saints on Earth, and you blas∣pheme
God himself. And therefore it should be farre from
us to abuse any ordinance or providence of God, for it is
blasphemie against God himselfe; they are the name of
God; Gods name is called on his providences: If we speak
evill of Gods ordinances or providences, as for a man to
say, would to God I had never known such a woman, it is
blasphemy; Gods wisedome and righteousnesse hath orday∣ned
it. If we be in distresse, or in any sicknesse, and we
snarle against God, and mutter at our poverty and sickness,
it is to blaspheme the name of God; all these are providen∣ces
of God. To speak evill of Churches, as if they were
Congregations of Heriticks, or Schismiticks, or Congrega∣tions
of Rebels, or Libertines, and Brownists, and such like,
it is blasphemy against the God of Heaven. Besides, it is blas∣phemy
against the Body of Christ in the Sacrament, to think
every Baker can make it, that is Popish blasphemy. To
speak evill of the Saints of God on earth, to thinke to take
liberty because they are absent; <HI>Our tongues are our owne,
who is Lord over us:</HI> Little do we know how tender God
is of his people: we cannot speak evill of any in the Church,
but we blaspheme God: And so if we speak evill of his pro∣vidences,
it is as much as if we speak evill of God himself.
And therefore how precious ought the name of God to be
to us, to whom our names are pretious: It is but a scan∣dall
to a christian brother, but it is blasphemy to God, and
therefore speak not evill, as thinking it shall never come to
his eare. If we speak evill of Authority, of Churches, of
Saints, or evill of them that doe evill, unlesse you may take
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
order to represse it, the Lord himself looks at it as blasphe∣my:
and therefore we must not look at it as a light matter;
our tongues are our own, and we may have liberty to speak:
I, you have liberty, but not to speak blasphemies, either small
or great. There is not the least blasphemy, but it is a great
Sinne, and therefore greatly to be avoyded.</P>

<Q><P>And power was given him to continue forty and two
moneths.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis is the continuance of the description of the former
Beast which the Apostle <HI>John</HI> saw rising out of the Sea,
to be the instrument of the Dragons power (that is, Satans
rage) against the Woman, and her feed.</P>
<P>Among other parts of the description (which have been o∣pened)
this Beast is described by the change that befell him,
in his head, wounded, and healed; the effect whereof was,</P>
<P>1. The admiration of the world.</P>
<P>2. The worship of the Beast, and of the Dragon.</P>
<P>The third effect or event was the authority or power that
the Beast did receive, and did exercise, and that power
was,</P>
<P>1. <HI>To speake great things and blasphemies;</HI> which according∣ly
he did exercise, in blaspheming the name of God,
and his Tabernacle, and the Saints.</P>
<P>2. There was a power of continuance (as it is here tran∣slated)
<HI>forty and two moneths.</HI></P>
<P>3. There was given to him power to make warre with the Saints,
and to overcome them.</P>
<P>Of the first part, to speak blasphemy, we have already spo∣ken.
Now come we unto the second part of the power gi∣ven
him, which is his continuance; <HI>There was power given
him to continue forty and two moneths.</HI></P>
<P>The note from thence is shortly this;</P>
<P>That power and authority was given to this Beast (that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctr. 2.</NOTE> to the
Roman Catholicke Church) to continue, that is, to be active and do∣ing,
to be busie fortie and two moneths.</P>
<P>This expresseth the sum and sence of the words; they are
obscure as any place in the word, and therefore need your
more diligent attention, and the power of the Lord Jesus to
<PB N="81" REF="45"/>
clear his counsel and will in this point, <HI>who alone openeth the
Seales, and none can shut them.</HI></P>
<P>To open the words.</P>
<P><HI>Power was given to him.]</HI> The word in the Originall is
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which properly signifies the power of Authority or Ju∣risdiction;
a soveraign kind of power (as it is here described
in the seventh <HI>verse) over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nati∣ons:</HI>
Such power that all the world wondered at it, and ado∣red,
especially that which they call the Christian world, did
exceedingly magnifie the power and authority of this Beast,
and he speakes here principally of Spirituall Authority,
though it grew to Temporall Power in making Warr, in the
7. <HI>vers.</HI> for he riseth by degrees to further power, but au∣thority
was given him: Given him, by whom?</P>
<P>1. By God, that put it into the heart of the tenne Horns
(that is, the tenne K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gs) to give their Kingdoms with one
consent to the Beast, <HI>Rev</HI> 17. 17. So God by his wise and
just providence gave him authority, such as God hath ordai∣ned
in his word; but he put it in their hearts by his wise and
just providence.</P>
<P>2. This authority was given by Satan, who assisted Anti∣christ
in the mystery of Iniquity, in working signs and lying
wonders, <HI>with all deceivablenesse of unrighteousnesse, till hee lift
up himselfe above all that is called God,</HI> 2 Thes. 2. 9, 10. And in∣deed
Satan wrought mightily, what by the sophistry of the
School-men, and by the policy of the Canonists, and what
by the devotion of Cloyster-men and Fryers, it was a won∣der
to see how he gained a mighty power against Churches
all the world over.</P>
<P>3. This power was given him by those States, the ten
Horns which gave their Crowns with one accord to the
Beast, that he should rule in their Dominions. The chiefe
Kingdoms in <HI>Europe</HI> are in these ten; our Native Countrey
for one, <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Navarre, Sweden,</HI> &amp; <HI>Denmarke,</HI>
and the rest, they did with one accord give their Kingdomes
to the Beast, that in point of Religion they should establish
all Ordinances according to the wisdome of his soveraign
power: And in Temporall matters they gave him greater
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>
power to depose, and dispose of their Kings, then the <HI>Roman</HI>
Emperour had in sundry respects; for his was lim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by
Laws, but this was without Laws. 2 <HI>Thes. 2. 4. He opposeth
and exalteth himselfe above all that is called God.</HI> That without
all power of Laws he did out-rage out of measure. Given it
was by their Devotion and Superstition, God piercing their
hearts much in those times by the Ministery of their Fryars,
that did wound their consciences with the sense of their
murthers and lusts, that they were willing to do any thing
for the peace of their Consciences, and therefore willingly
gave up all their power and Kingdomes into his hands; so it
was given him.</P>
<P>Again further, he is said to continue.] Some Translations
doe read it, <HI>to make Warre,</HI> but War is not in the best corre∣cted
Copies, but <HI>making Warre</HI> is spoken to in the seventh <HI>ver.</HI>
But making War is not spoken to expresly in this fifth <HI>verse;</HI>
but power was given him to be doing; and as we call it in a
generall phrase, to be (a <HI>Factotum)</HI> the onely doer of the
world forty two moneths: That what he did was done, and
what he did not authorize and allow, it was not done. If the
Princes chose an Emperour, if he accepted him, he stood; if
he did not accept of him, he was not received. If any decrees
be made, if the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> establish them (which is the
seventh head) then they are authenticall; If he do not, then
they are Apocrypha. So it is with Scripture; though it be
such as God never ratified, as the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> but what sense
he gives it is Authenticall; He hath power to be active and
doing. This word then <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is here translated <HI>to
continue,</HI> doth indeed so signifie usually, when it is joyned
with words of time; you have many examples of it in Scrip∣ture,
as in <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 33. it is said, <HI>After they had tarried there
a space,</HI> the word is the same as here, <HI>continue.</HI> So in <HI>Acts</HI> 18.
23. it is said, <HI>After they had tarried some time;</HI> about three
moneths. So in <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 3. you have there continuance or
tarrying expressed by the same word: And <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Night
and day I was in the deep, 2 Cor.</HI> 11. 25. the same word; he had
his businesse there, there he was duely, he continued so long.
But sometimes the word ever used with this word of time,
signifies to be active and busie: So in <HI>James 4. 13. You say you
<PB N="83" REF="46"/>
will goe into such a Citie, &amp; continue there a yeare, and buy, and sell,
and get gaine;</HI> the same word here and there; you will be busie
and gaining, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This same power therefore to continue and
be doing, argues that this authority of power, absolute
Soveraign power over Kindreds, Nations, and Tongues, this
is here said to continue a matter of 42. moneths.</P>
<P>Now for these 42. moneths.] I would not busie my selfe
in needlesse speculations: but I finde not any word of God a
neednesse speculation for the Church to search into, and un∣derstand.
We have had this number three or foure times be∣fore:
For it is the same number, of which it is said, <HI>The Gen∣tiles
shall tread under foot the holy City forty two moneths,</HI> Rev. 11.
2. And 42. moneths, if they be dissolved into dayes, make up
just the sum of a thousand two hundred and threescore days,
allowing thirty dayes to a moneth as the old account was
wont to do, which is the same time of the <HI>two Witnesses pro∣phecying,
cloathed in sack-cloath,</HI> Rev. 11. 3. And the same time
of a thousand two hundred and threescore dayes, or forty
two moneths, is just the computation of three years and an
halfe; that is, <HI>a time, and times, and halfe a time;</HI> which time it
is said <HI>the woman fled into the wildernesse, and was nourished there,</HI>
Rev. 12. 6. So that all these are manifest to be contempora∣ry
(as they call it) to begin together in the same period of
time, and to end together; The Beasts rising and continuing
in power 42. moneths: The Gentiles (which is the Roman
Catholick Church) treading down the true Church of God
forty two moneths: And the two Witnesses prophecying in
sack-cloath 1260. dayes: And the womans flight into the
wildernesse, and her continuance and abode there 1260.
dayes, where she was nourished by the prophecying of those
two Witnesses: So that expound aright one of these, and you
cleare the right Interpretation of all. Three questions
therefore may be enquired into to open the durance or conti∣nuance
of the authority of this Beast.</P>
<P>1. Whether this be a definitive, or indefinitive time?</P>
<P>2. Why it is sometimes reckoned by moneths, and some∣times
by dayes: And</P>
<P>3. When doth this time take his beginning, and where
doth it expire and take his ending. These things spoken to,
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>
will reach as farre as God hath revealed to me.</P>
<P>For the first of these Questions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest: 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. There be that think this time is not a definite or de∣terminate
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE> but indefinite; forty two moneths shewes a
good space of time, known, and determined by God, but un∣certaine
to the Church. Now I must confesse, that meaning
doth not well sink into my heart, to receive it with any faith
in Gods word; for if God would have put a definite time for
an indefinite; a certain time for an uncertaine, I thinke he
would rather have chosen (as he is wont to do) some such
phrase as is wont to expresse illimited time, if it had been se∣ven
moneths, or ten moneths: <HI>Thou hast changed my wages tenne
times</HI> saith <HI>Jacob</HI> to <HI>Laban;</HI> that is, many times: <HI>How often
shall I forgive my brother, till seven times?</HI> I, <HI>till seventy times se∣ven
times:</HI> He doth not meanee, to limit us, but as oft as he
doth offend, forgive, if he repent; or if he professe such re∣pentance
as you have no just exception against, forgive him:
But when he saith 42. moneths, why not 600. moneths, for
that is a definite time for an indefinite: why should hee say
1260. dayes, it is not a speech used in Greek and Latine to
express an indefinite number: no more is the time, and times,
and halfe a time, usuall in <HI>Daniel.</HI> Therefore I cannot rest in
that Interpretation, though sundry have gone that way.</P>
<P>2. There be that take it indeed for a definite time, but
they would confine it to three years and an halfe, for forty
two moneths, or 1260. dayes, is just three yeares and an
halfe, and that is true: But I cannot accept that Interpreta∣tion;
and though it be common, yet our Divines do with
one accord reject it: For this Antichrist which they say is
their Beast (in which they say true) that he should come out
of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> three years and an halfe before the great Judg∣ment
day, and prevaile against <HI>Rome:</HI> But that it cannot be
taken for three years and an halfe, may appeare from the
great authority he shall gaine in this time, and the power
that he shall exercise over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and
Nations; now for any one in three yeares and an halfe to o∣vercome
all Nations, and to rule them by an Ecclesiasticall
and Civill power, it is incredible. The Leopard of <HI>Greece,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="47"/>
which was a swift Beast, and had wings, yet he did not con∣quer
the world but in twelve yeares, and it was a great
matter to overcome it then: But this Beast is described to be
a Leopard, but not with wings: now that he should do as
much in three yeares and an halfe without wings, as <HI>Alexan∣der</HI>
did in twelve years with wings, is not credible.</P>
<P>3. There is a third Interpretation that make indeed the
dayes, and time, and moneths definite; that is, determined
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, and do limit them according to the account of the
Prophets that take a day for a yeare: A like proportion of
42. moneths, of a <HI>time, times, and halfe a time,</HI> and of 1260.
dayes; taking a day for a yeare, they will all come to the
same period, to the same computation of 1260. yeares. Now
that the Prophets do sometimes so reckon them, appears
from <HI>Ezek.</HI> 4. 5, 6. where the Lord did direct the Prophet to
lye upon his side 390 dayes, according to the defection of
<HI>Israel</HI> from the house of <HI>David,</HI> in all which time the Prophet
did beare the burden of the defection of the People; and to
represent that: <HI>Son of man</HI> (saith he) <HI>I have given thee to lye so
long, I have appointed each day for a yeare; thou shalt lye so many
dayes, as their apostacy hath continued in yeares:</HI> For from the
defection of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> to the captivity of the Land, they con∣tinued
390. years. <HI>And after that</HI> (saith he) <HI>thou shalt turne
thee, and lye upon thy other side forty dayes,</HI> and that was the
time of the renewing of the Covenant by <HI>Josiah,</HI> in which the
Lord was reconciled with his people: but the people falling
into apostacy againe, it proved forty dayes more.</P>
<P>And so when the twelve Spyes had gone forty dayes, and
searched out the Land, the Lord saith, <HI>They shall beare the
provocation of their Fathers forty yeares, after the number
of the dayes in which yee searched the Land, even forty dayes,
each day for a yeare,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 34. So that this is a Pro∣pheticall
phrase in mysticall Scriptures; when <HI>Ezekiel</HI> is to
set out a vision for God to expresse his Justice, he sets it
down dayes for years: Then it is not uncouth, but very a∣greeable
to Scripture, to say 1260. dayes is so many yeares,
and forty two moneths being so many dayes is all one, and
those dayes being three yeares and an halfe, if you reckon e∣very
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>
day for a yeare, they will be just 1260. yeares; that
therefore I take to be most agreeable to Scripture phrase, and
the sense of the words.</P>
<P>But then here grows a second Question.</P>
<P>Why doth he reckon some of these times by dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest: 2.</NOTE> and some by
moneths?</P>
<P>There may be a double reason of that.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. When he describes what the Children of God doe, he
sums up their actions by dayes. Children of light, it is meet
that their actions should be measured out by the period of
dayes: The Witnesses prophecying, and the womans flight
into the wildernesse is said to be 1260. dayes: But as
God gave the Sunne to rule the day, so the Moon to rule
the night, <HI>Psal.</HI> 136. 8, 9. Now therefore when you are to
speak of superstitious devotions, they are works indeed of
darknesse, and therefore are best reckoned by moneths, by
that Creature in Heaven which measures out Night, the
Moon: And therefore it may be, and so the holy Ghost useth
it, if he speak of the Gentiles treading under foot the holy
City, though it be by day-light, yet it is a work of darkness;
<HI>They tread under foot the holy City forty two moneths,</HI> Rev. 11. 2.
And if Antichrist be to continue long, all his continuance is
but a work of darknesse, and therefore he is said to continue
42. moneths: But what the Church do, and what the Wit∣nesses
do, is reckoned by dayes, but it is the same time, the
one makes day-work of it, and the other night-work.</P>
<P>There may be also this Reason; That the Apostle in these
Prophecyes in the New Testament, might allude to the like
in the old Testament, as to <HI>Antiochus</HI> whose dispensation was
only a time, and times, and halfe a time.</P>
<P><HI>Now for the third Quest:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest: 3.</NOTE> when this may be said to begin, and
when it may be said to end?</P>
<P>There I confesse lyes the greatest difficulty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. Some of our best interpreters pitch the beginning from
the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Constantine,</HI> when the Man-child
was brought forth, that is, advanced to Imperiall dignity,
which some make in the yeare 304 after Christ; though it be
true, of later times, they will by no meanes grant his Reigne
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>
began then, but two or three years after, and an easie mistake
grows there; for when they come to measure out a Princes
Reign, they begin in such a time, and a whole yeare is al∣lowed
to it, and it may be the next begins in that year, and
so they bring a variation in Chronologies; but you may not
wonder in such mistakes, if there be foure or five years varia∣tion,
that makes no great difference; God knows certain∣ly;
but through reckoning the last yeare of one, and the first
of another, applying the same to both, may sometimes make
a yeares difference: But holy <HI>Brightman</HI> makes the beginning
of that time to be in <HI>Constantines</HI> coming to the Crown, and
thence expires the authority of this Beast in the yeare 1546.
Now though his paines have been most serviceable to the
Church of all that have written of this Book, and God is to
be exceedingly magnified for him, and his Learning esteemed;
that having such a Prophetical spirit, he spake so homely and
plainly, that without pregnant reason I would not perveri∣cate
his judgment: Yet as it falls out ordinarily, there is
something amisse in the best humane Writers that ever wrote;
Therefore let me tell you what doth not satisfie me: The first
is this, that neither in the beginning nor end doth it punctu∣ally
jump and suite with all events described.</P>
<P>First, for the beginning, it is sayd, <HI>the woman fled into the
wildernesse, and continued a time, and times, and halfe a time, af∣ter
the Dragon was cast out of heaven, and there was place found for
him in heaven;</HI> And it is true, <HI>Constantine</HI> made warre against
the Dragon, but I cannot say there was no place for him in
heaven, for this was the failing of the good Emperor, that he
still allowed the Heathens Idols Temples to continue, though
he shut the doors; and his Successor <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate ope∣ned
them againe, and restored the Dragon to spiritual autho∣rity,
stated him in heaven as before with a great part of the
Empire.</P>
<P>And besides this, certaine it is till <HI>Gracians</HI> time, they all
kept the title of <HI>Pontifex maximus</HI> which was an honour be∣longing
to the great Priest of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or to the Devill; One∣ly
<HI>Gracian,</HI> and <HI>Theodosius</HI> after him, being tender in consci∣ence,
refused it, then the Senate of <HI>Rome</HI> sayd if he will not
<PB N="88" REF="49"/>
be <HI>Pontifex maximus</HI> yet they will have him to <HI>Rome,</HI> and call
him to <HI>Rome,</HI> and had it not been by a marvelous providence,
they had wonderfully prevailed; for at the same time they
did restore all the Temples as <HI>Julian</HI> had done, and establi∣shed
all the Revenues belonging to them, restored them all
to the Priests, and the Devill had the place of worship as be∣fore;
but the Lord putting them down by a mighty provi∣dence
of his, through the prosperity of <HI>Theadosius,</HI> he utterly
overthrew that title, and through the zeal of his spirit cast
down the Temples, would suffer none of them to stand,
rooted them out from East to West; Wherever there was a∣ny
famous Temples, down he throws them; he utterly re∣nounceth
the <HI>Pontifex maximus,</HI> and will have no Temples;
he doth confiscate the revenues to the Emperors treasury;
and from that time forward indeed, they never recovered,
there was no more place found in Heaven: It is true, <HI>Con∣stantine</HI>
began that war in the Empire: but war, it is not a
Skirmish or a Battell, it is not soon done, but many times
continues long, as between the house of <HI>David,</HI> and the house
of <HI>Saul,</HI> and that for some scores of yeares: So in this case,
the war began with <HI>Constantine,</HI> there holy <HI>Brightman</HI> takes
it most right; but for the accomplishment of it, for the De∣vill
to be wholly cast out, and no more place found in Hea∣ven,
that was not till <HI>Theodosius</HI> time; now from that time
the Emperors renouncing the title of <HI>Pontifex maximus,</HI> the
Popish sort thought it was a marvellous providence for the
advancing of the Roman Catholick Church, that is this
Beast; so the next year the Pope took up that name, and
holds it to this day: what ever the Popes name be, it is <HI>Pon∣tifex
maximus,</HI> that is his ordinary style, not Bishop, or Arch
Bishop, or Primate, or Metropolitan, these are but Images
of the Beast, but the head of this Beast is <HI>Pontifex maximus,</HI> the
chiefe Bishop of <HI>Rome:</HI> Now this was to the best observati∣on
that I can finde, in the year 395. about 90. years after
<HI>Constantines</HI> time, or wanting one or two of that: Now
that is therefore one Reason why I doe not conceive that
these 42. months are only at least to be reckoned from <HI>Con∣stautines</HI>
beginning of his reigne, for they are reckoned from
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>
the time when there was no place found for the Dragon in
Heaven, which was afterwards accomplished about 90 years
after. Another Reason why I cannot goe so fully with
that holy man of God, is, because of the end of it, when he
comes to 1546. It is evident that in that year the Councell
of <HI>Trent</HI> did condemn the Scriptures, and advance the vulgar
Latine to be the authenticall word of God: And <HI>Charles</HI>
the fifth did prevail against the Lant-grave of <HI>Hesse,</HI> &amp; Proste∣stant
Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> in the year 1547. So by that rea∣son
it cannot end aright, for the Beast hath power given him
to continue to make war for 42 moneths; now he continu∣ed
longer then so, though it is true, his time was limited
soon after; and therefore I cannot with so full assurance go
so clearly with him in that, as usually I do in his Interpre∣tation,
yet still reserving this liberty, according to the gift
of the spirit of Prophecy he had, you may many times read
the context of the word of God, it may be sometimes some∣what
more exactly according to the true meaning then all∣wayes
is exprest; which I speak not to impeach the faith∣fulnesse
and learning of the holy man of God, but would
give every man the honour that God hath put upon them,
make use of their gifts, and leave them where they may at a∣ny
time mistake, the like liberty God forbid but may be left
to others that come after us.</P>
<P>2. Therefore if you doe a little more narrowly search the
Text, and weigh every circumstance in it, you may observe
(as I take it) a double computation of this time in respect
of the beginning and ending of it; for you shall read which
M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Brightman</HI> rightly observes; that the woman fled into
the wildernesse at <HI>Constantines</HI> coming to the Crown, it is
true, for so it is expresly sayd, <HI>Revel. 12. 6. She fled into the
wildernesse, where she had a place prepared of God:</HI> and this was
before the battell was sought; and then he tells you of the
battell that was fought in <HI>vers.</HI> 7, 8, 9.; The end of which
was, <HI>there was no place for the Dragon in Heaven;</HI> and now
there is given two wings of an Eagle unto the woman, that
she might flee into the wildernesse into her place, where she
is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time from the
face of the Serpent, which is just 42 moneths. So that take
<PB N="90" REF="50"/>
both these places, and it will appear there is a double begin∣ning
of this time; the one from <HI>Constantines</HI> Reigne, the o∣ther
96 or 97 years after, there abouts it was, there is the
beginning of it. Now if you take it by moneths, and take
it not as holy <HI>Brightman</HI> doth, the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> yeare, but the
<HI>Roman</HI> yeare; methinks it is most probable to take the ac∣count
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Affaires to be registred by Roman com∣putation,
not <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> though it is true, <HI>Rome</HI> is spiritually
called <HI>Egypt,</HI> but that's in another sence, they did not follow
them in computation; and though the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> count 30
dayes to a moneth, which sutes well with this, yet it is not
usuall in Scripture; for roundnesse of number sake, they
pitch a certain time of the moneth, 30 dayes for a moneth;
and therfore if you count so may years in the <HI>Roman</HI> Kallen∣der,
you shall come somewhat neere the account of the con∣tinuance
of the Power, and transcendant Authority of this
Beast; and if you so reckon 1260. years, if you adde them
to 300. and the odde four years after before <HI>Constantines</HI> be∣ginning,
there-abouts it was; and computations are not
clear, the expiration will fall somewhat after the beginning
of the reigne of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> And especially if you take
the account from more exact Chronologies, it will come in
the year wherein the Pope sent a Bull, that is, an excommu∣nication
agaist Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to deliver her to Satan,
which brought forth new treasons against her that followed
every year, and brought her at length the <HI>Spanish</HI> invasion,
hostile invasion; but from that time it was, that the blast of
his power was then broken; that whereas before if he had
excommunicated a Prince, it was fatall, he could never have
stood out, he had been everlastingly blasted with his hopes,
but from that time forward, it hath been truly said by
some, that have spoken of this time, that from that
time all the Popes Bulls were but baubles; they could
not prevaile against her, though they brought the Ex∣communication,
and fastned it upon the Cathedrall Church
as they call it, and afterwards read it; she going to prayer,
used the words of the Prophet, <HI>Psal. Though they curse, blesse
thou, let them be confounded that rise up against me, but let thy ser∣vant
rejoyce:</HI> God heard her prayer, and marvellously broke
<PB N="91" REF="50"/>
his power, he had not the power that the great Bishop of
<HI>Rome</HI> had, who by his power should rend rocks in peices,
and blast all before him, he never had that power after: God
delighting by weak means to bring mighty things to passe:
By her hand the Lord did maintain the low Countries, that
this beast had great power over, his arme was broken there;
and so against the King of <HI>Navar</HI> by her assisting him; and so
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> she mightily prevailed to break his power there;
and so in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where she set her hand, she brake mightily
his power, and the power of Catholick Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though
mightier then she. She renounced the Catholick Church,
that is this great beast, and cut off his head to her best under∣standing,
which was about the sounding of the seventh
Trumpet, <HI>Rev. 11. 15. When the Kingdomes of this world be∣came
the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Christ:</HI> For then did
begin the seventh Trumpet to sound, which brought the
conversion of Kingdomes and States; that though the beast
still continued, yet he still lost his Authority which he had
before; what he did approve before, that stood, and what he
did not, that fell to the ground. Now he hath so much
power, that if <HI>France</HI> be more pravalent, or <HI>Spaine,</HI> he will
take with them, as he thinks he may with his Catholick
Sons for his own security: but his power is so blasted, that
though he doth continue still, and will continue, yet a great
Beast that rules all the world; that power the Catholick Ro∣man
Church hath lost, though he prevail with his superstiti∣ous
inventions with those that are his in a carnall way, or
from an opinion of their fathers honesty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But yet the
power is not left to the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> to doe all things, as
in those former times he might; his word is not a law, nor
his decrees so Authenticall, they are now considered of, even
among Catholicke Princes; It is not now in his power to
take up Controversies between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> if they will
make war: Time was, they durst as well have eaten a Bears
foot, as have ventured upon any war without his likeing;
but that was the time when the armes of his power, and his
jawes were not broken.</P>
<P>Thus if you take this Scripture as <HI>Brightman</HI> takes it, from
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>
<HI>Constantines</HI> coming to the Crown, it will expire then about
the time when the Bull came forth against Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: <HI>Eliz.</HI> and as
they thought would be sufficient to blast her, and all the <HI>Hu∣guenots</HI>
with her: But yet that makes but one beginning and
ending of this account, whereas the Text makes two; for in
<HI>Chap.</HI> 12. 6. when the child was caught up to God, and to
his throne, and the woman fled into the wildernesse, then
there was a great battle; that battle lasted 90 years, and
then was the Devill cast out of Heaven, and his Flamins, and
Arch-flamins were blasted with him, they had no power in
<HI>Theodosius</HI> time: from that time the Dragon was cast out of
Heaven, and persecuted the woman which brought forth the
man child, and there was given to her two wings of a great
Eagle, that she might flee into the wildernesse: Now I say
according to this, there is another computation of this time,
there was no more place found for him in heaven w<SUP>ch</SUP> was in
the year 395. for two or three years, we must not pinch much;
it is hard to keep exact account by reason of taking up one
year from the Predecessor, which in so many years come to
sometimes more, sometimes lesse: Now if you shall take
the Computation from that time, (tis true from <HI>Constantines</HI>
time, the Church might fly into the wildernesse; for it is
true, the Church is made a wildernesse if you set the doores
of the Church so wide and pull down the walls, that where∣as
before, <HI>it was a Garden inclosed,</HI> Cant. 4. 12. now you let
in vast territories, bring in the whole world, now you make
it Catholick; now though it had no Catholick power; a
Garden is made a wildernesse if you pull down the pales,
take down the narrow watch of Officers, and let in all men
that will thrust in ambitiously to gratifie them; The Church
was full of covetousnesse, whoredomes, adulteries, decei∣vers,
haters of God, and the true power of Godlinesse, even
in his time, and so forward, was almost worn out, and never
was so in all the time of persecution; but after that the Bi∣shop
of <HI>Rome</HI> had taken the stile of <HI>Pontifex maximus,</HI> and <HI>The∣odosius</HI>
slept with his Fathers, then the Church grew more
transcendantly Catholick, and that they thought he would
be Lord Paramount; but yet his transcendant power did
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>
spring as he was cheif Bishop, then he was universall Bishop,
for his power grew by degrees;) Now I say, if you take
this latter computation, which also the Text doth, then if
you reckon from 395. years, and adde to that 1260. years,
putting these two together, they will expire in the yeare, that
shall be according to the Roman account 1655. I will not
be two confident, because I am not a Prophet, nor the Son
of a Prophet to foretell things to come, but so far as God
helps by Scripture light, about the time 1655. there will be
then such a blow given to this beast, and to the head of this
beast, which is <HI>Pontifex maximus,</HI> as that we shall see a further
gradual accomplishment and fulfilling of this Prophecy here.
You must not think it strange that some Prophecies receive a
graduall accomplishment; Sometimes you have a Prophecy
of the 70. yeares captivity, which is accomplished by the re∣demption
of the Church out of <HI>Babell;</HI> yet a more full ac∣complishment
shall be when the Church shall be delivered
from this whore of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Church of the <HI>Jewes</HI> shall
be called againe. So it is here, according to the different
computation of time, the wise God hath all seasons in his
hand, he doth foresee, and foretell to his people when they
shall come to passe: So that though the arme of his glorious
power be broken, and his bones broken, that he is nothing
that beast in power that he was, and hath not been since the
sending of that dreadfull excommunication, which was
thought to be so dangerous to the famous Princesse I spake
of; yet a power he hath over many Churches, and the pow∣er
given him by the ten horns, they are not all broken; as in
<HI>Chap. 11. 13. The tenth part of the City fell by reason of the earth∣quake:</HI>
There was such a fall, that a tenth part fell, but yet
a great part stands still to this day in some measure, that will
take their Religion from him as they see cause, but not all in
Religion neither, for the King of <HI>France</HI> will not yield to the
Councell of <HI>Trent</HI> to this day; it falling out that his Ambas∣sadors
did not sit in the cheife place, he will not authorize
that Councell: Thus is his power broken, but yet it conti∣nues
in some measure till a further accomplishment of it,
but for two or three years I cannot limit that, for there may
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>
be some uncertainty by reason of the variation of Chronicles
that have sometimes more, sometimes lesse in the beginning
and ending of the Reign of Princes: But otherwise, about
that time will be the expiration of the power and great au∣thority
of this Beast: But already we see, by the blessing of
God, his power weakned, but we look for a further accom∣plishment.</P>
<P>The matter hath required some-what large opening, but
it is a counsell of God, and given of him for this end, that
it may be expounded and explained: And the Lord hath pro∣mised
blessednesse, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. to those that read and search this
Booke; and therefore he would encourage all to search dili∣gently
the meaning of it, especially as God gives opportu∣nity:
It was that which <HI>John</HI> mourned for, that he found
none worthy to open this book, and to loose the seals there∣of,
only the Lyon of the Tribe of <HI>Judah:</HI> I think there is no
man shall be diligently studious on this Book, depending up∣on
the Lyon of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> for helpe, but he shall find
something more then he did expect. It is true, if a man go in
confidence of his own gifts and knowledge, he may foole
himself; but if in modesty of Christian wisdome, and in the
feare of God; the spirit of any Christian Minister, or other
that layes hold of this Book, he shall not be sent empty a∣way:
What light God hath given me in this particular, you
have heard opened.</P>
<P>The use in a word is thus much.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> it is a word of stay to the soules of Gods people: It
serves to strengthen our faith, that the Lord is exact in his
Propheticall expressions: Look what he speaks, though it
be many a yeare or day before, he will not faile to bring it
to accomplishment in his time. It is truly observed, if God
tarry long, <HI>a thousand years with God is but as one day,</HI> till the
appointed time come: But when his time is come, then <HI>one
day with God is as a thousand yeares:</HI> God will as soon faile a
thousand yeares, as one day: Indeed till his time be come, he
thinks it not long, though it tarry 1260. yeares; but when it
is come, then he will not faile one day. It is a memorable
speech that in <HI>Exod. 12. 40, 41, 42. The sojourning of the chil∣dren
<PB N="95" REF="52"/>
of Aegypt was foure hundred and thirty yeares: And it came to
passe at the end of the foure hundred and thirty yeares, even the self∣same
day it came to passe, that all the host of the Lord went out from
the Land of Aegypt: It is a night much to be observed,</HI> &amp;c. Hee
doth not say they dwelt there so long, but were sojourners
there: <HI>And it came to passe at the end of the foure hundred and thir∣ty
yeares, even the selfe same day, it came to passe that all the best
of the Lord went out from the Land of Aegypt;</HI> as if God would
put some Emphasis upon it: The word in the Originall is, <HI>in
the bones of the day:</HI> It is an usuall Hebraism, the strength of a
thing they call the bones of it; that is, in the face of all the
people, in the strength of the day, even when it was full
day: God kept reckoning to a day; he will as well faile a
thousand yeares as one day when his time is come; and till
his time be come, we must think it long if he stay a thousand
yeares: It must therefore strengthen our Faith, that God is
the same God in the New Testament, as in the Old; that if
we could know times as exactly as God knows them, we
might write, in the bones of such a yeare and day, the bones
of the Roman Catholick Church is broken, and lyes bed∣rid;
as it is foretold, <HI>Jezebel shall be cast into the bed of afflicti∣on,
and all that commit adultery with her into great tribulation.</HI> Let
it strengthen the faith of Gods people in every time; for if
God be so exact in every circumstance, what time he sets, he
will keep, then it may more strengthen us in substantiall
promises and threatnings: and what ever the Lord hath spo∣ken,
be not discouraged, the Lord will make good what hee
hath spoken, he will not faile of a minute of time when his
period is come.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> it may serve to encourage us the more to pray
to God for a speedy accomplishment of the power of this
great Beast (the Roman Catholick visible Church) that hath
bewitched the world for so many ages together, and to grow
this way in our prayers for the destruction of him from yeare
to yeare: and the neerer the time of the accomplishment
grows, the more earnest should our expectations be to see the
accomplishment, and the more earnest our prayers should
be.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="53"/>
You read of holy <HI>Daniel,</HI> that when hee understood by
books, that the Lord had set the captivity for 70. years, then
he set himselfe by prayer and supplication to seek the Lord,
in <HI>Dan.</HI> 9. 1, 2, 3. He takes this very occasion; he found it was
written that thereabouts it would be, and he found that
time was at hand, therefore he wrestles with God in fasting
and prayer for the accomplishment of that deliverance: And
so ought we to do; and indeed about that time it is, that
in the Exposition of other Scriptures, that holy man of God
that hath given light to this Booke; some-what after he en∣courageth
to look for no small changes that may befall the
State: So that it may encourage us to look for such a great
mercy: It is a great mercy that the Lord hath discovered the
vanity of subjection to the Roman Catholick Church, from
day to day the Lord discovers it more and more to this
country, and hath given us to see the true platform of a true
Church, from which the Roman Catholick Church is so
far disproportionable (to be governed by a supream head, in¦stead
of a particular Church ordered by Pastors and Teach∣ers,
there is such a vast distance) that well doth the holy
Ghost call it a great Beast, a lewd Strumpet, to undertake
such an Institution. Therefore as the thing hath been odi∣ous
in Gods sight long, so let us pray that he will go on to
break the power of this Beast: It hath not been in vain, what
a blow he hath given to the Image of this Beast, by the late
stirs in <HI>Scotland:</HI> True it is, before great deliverances, there
will be great afflictions, whether here, or else-where: It is
an usuall providence to the most faithfull ones of God: But
what ever bitter cup the Lord may give us to drink of, yet the
day of this great Beast is coming, wherein he is to go to per∣dition:
He hath begun to fall before the Lamb; and if he be∣gin
to fall before him, say the Magicians to the Kings Favou∣rite
<HI>Haman, Esth. 6. 13. If Mordecai be of the seed of the
Jewes before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevaile a∣gainst
him, but shalt surely in falling fall;</HI> that is, fall more and
more: It's true, there may be some pangs, as a Beast when
he is going to his last gaspe, he will fling with his tayle, and
with his horns; but he is falling, and leaves not falling till
<PB N="97" REF="53"/>
he finally fall; though there be pangs, as dying creatures, to
win the horse, or lose the saddle, but otherwise he will ne∣ver
stand, that there may be a <HI>Factotum</HI> at that time, and will
grow more and more after that time.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Rev. 13. 7.</BIBL>
<Q><P>And it was given unto him to make warre with the Saints,
and to overcome them: and power was given him over
all Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations,</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHen the Devill, that is to say, the Dragon, could
not find any longer resting place in heaven, that
is to say, he could no longer enjoy Soveraign
and divine worship as the great God <HI>(Constantine</HI> and his Suc∣cessors
having brought in Christ and his worship alone in¦stead
of all the gods of the Gentiles;) He therefore to re∣venge
himselfe, makes warre against the Church, that were
the rooters out of Pagan Idolatry: This warre, because he
could not manage by himselfe, it being very strong, he there∣fore
raiseth two Beasts out of his power, the first and second
Beasts in this Chapter; the first, from <HI>vers.</HI> 1. to the 10. The
second, from <HI>vers.</HI> 10. to the end of the Chapter. It was a
third Roman State, not <HI>Rome-Pagan,</HI> nor <HI>Rome-Christian,</HI>
but <HI>Rome-antichristian,</HI> that is to say, the Roman visible Ca∣tholick
Church. This is described many wayes, by a wound
given him upon one of his heads for a season; that when
<HI>Rome</HI> was sacked, he was almost in a forlorn estate, and des∣pairing
of recovery; but being healed, the effects were</P>
<P>1. The worlds admiration after the Beast.</P>
<P>2. Their worship both of the Beast, and of the Dragon, <HI>which is
Satan himselfe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="54"/>
The third event is <HI>Power,</HI> or as the word signifies, <HI>Authority
(ver. 5, 6, 7.)</HI> And this <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> did stretch forth
it selfe to three employments.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He had power given him to speake great things and blas∣phemies;
<HI>He might speak blasphemy by authority.</HI></P>
<P>The second power that was given him, was to continue,
or to be doing, to be acting and working all in all, for the
number of 42. moneths, which in the former Chapter is de∣scribed
by dayes, and the dayes meant years, 1260. yeares,
which have been at large spoken to.</P>
<P>The third power and authority given him, was, <HI>To make
warre with the Saints;</HI> and that not a vain and loose war, but an
effectuall prevailing war, a victorious war: <HI>It was given him
to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome them.</HI></P>
<P>There was also a fourth power given him, and that was
<HI>dominion over all the Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations:</HI> All Chri∣stian
Kingdomes, they did all of them submit their Crowns
and Scepters to this Beast, the Roman Catholick visible
Church, whereof the Pope is the seventh head, for he had
seven heads, and ten horns: Five of them were fallen, the
sixth then which was the <HI>Caesars,</HI> and the Pope he was the se∣venth.
Two of these Powers have been opened; <HI>Power to
blaspheme;</HI> and <HI>Power to continue, and be doing.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the third Power or Authority given to this
Beast, and that is, <HI>to make war with the Saints, and to overcome
them.</HI></P>
<P>The note then is shortly this;</P>
<P>The Roman visible Catholicke Church had power to make warre
against the Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctr. 3.</NOTE> yea and to overcome them. <HI>They are in a man∣ner
the words of the Text, explained in their true meaning.</HI></P>
<P>The warre that he speaks of (as I conceive) in this place,
is not a spirituall warre (though that also this beast did
make, for he caused all that dwelt upon the Earth to admire
and adore him, and that was spirituall war:) But he speaks
of such a warre here, the effect whereof is killing with the
Sword; <HI>Hee that killeth with the sword must be killed with the
sword,</HI> vers. 10. As if God would reward him in his owne
kind: He that slayes many thousands of Christians with the
<PB N="99" REF="54"/>
sword, that is, by the power of warre, he himselfe shall at
length be destroyed by warre also: So that he speaks of a war
fought by Arms, by slaughter and blood-shed, by open ex∣pedition
of Military persons fighting in the quarrell of this
beast against the Saints of God. There is another warre men∣tioned
in the 17. <HI>Chap.</HI> of this book, where it is said, this
Beast, and the ten Horns, that is, the Christian Kings, that
shall give their power and authority to this Beast, shall make
warre with the Lamb; and they which are of the Lambs
side, <HI>are called, and chosen, and faithfull,</HI> and here they are call∣ed
Saints: But there you shall see it is not the same kinde of
warre, but differing there from what is here; for there it is
sayd, <HI>They shall make warre with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall o∣vercome
them;</HI> but here it is said, <HI>He shall make warre with the
Saints, and overcome the Saints:</HI> So that one of these warres he
speaks of, when he that hath smitten others, he shall be
smitten himselfe; that is, towards the end of his Authority;
then the Lamb shall make warre, and overcome him; but in
the meane time he hath power to make warre, and overcome
them, it is therefore a bloody warre: And it is not said that
he began this war as soon as he began to do; for here are sun∣dry
acts and passages of Authority, before he comes to this
transcendant power to violent warre: Hee was admired and
adored in the consciences of all Roman Catholicks; Hee had
done many things, spake great blasphemies many a day, and
yeare together: And in the end he receives also this power,
<HI>to make warre with the Saints;</HI> that he was able to muster up
such an Army of his owne, or his Horns, that is, those Prin∣ces
that were obedient to him, as he was able to make warr.
Now this Scripture (I conceive) was accomplished in his
wars against the <HI>Waldenses</HI> and <HI>Albingenses</HI> in the 12. Century
after Christ, they held all things conformable to the Scrip∣tures,
and the Fathers, as they called them, and every way
Orthodoxall, only they blasphemed the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
this Beast could not tell what he had against them otherwise;
but otherwise he commended them for their honesty, piety,
and good dealing, and there was nothing culpable in their
doing, but that they spake against the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> now
<PB N="100" REF="55"/>
against them did the Pope and the Catholick Church procure
many expeditions of sore warre for many yeares together,
and in conclusion rooted them out of the Countrey, and
scattered them up and downe, some to some part of <HI>France,</HI>
some to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> some to <HI>Germany,</HI> some to <HI>England,</HI> and
some to one place, and some to another: though the Papists
did confesse that the people were not rooted out, but scatte∣red;
and where-ever they came, they propagated their Reli∣gion,
that it was more and more spread where they came;
but they overcame them, for they slew (as stands upon Re∣cord)
about ten hundred thousands of them, and did burn
up their Cities, and Cattell, fel'd their wood, that there
might be no more Hereticks nestled in that wildernesse; and
they did take a course that Midwives, and Mothers, and In∣fants
in the womb, all should be slaughtered by fire and
sword, that there might be no more continuance of that
Generation: So that in this War the Pope did mightily pre∣vaile,
and prospered so farre, that he spread all Christendom,
and in one battle did overcome a great many of the Saints:
Whereupon the <HI>Waldenses</HI> being warned by a Religious man
sent by the Bishop of <HI>Tholouse,</HI> to confesse the hand of God a∣gainst
them for Hereticall pravity, in blaspheming the
Roman Catholick visible Church, and continuing so long
in it, and to turn to the Catholick Church: For their de∣fence,
to answer the Temptation that was put upon them,
said they, it is written, <HI>The Beast shall make war with the Saints
and overcome them;</HI> therefore it is no argument of Gods being
against us, in respect of our Religion, for he may acknow∣ledg
us Saints, though we be slain to this day; and therefore
though there were but a handful left, they would rather dye,
then yeeld to conformity to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> So you see
the point opened: For the Reasons,</P>
<P>First, how this Beast comes to have this power to make
warre.</P>
<P>Secondly, how the Saints come thus to be warred upon.</P>
<P>And thirdly, how they come to be overcome (for all these
would be opened.)</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> this beast had power given him to make warre by se∣verall
<PB N="101" REF="55"/>
hands; First, the devout subjection of the ten Christian
Kings to him, that gave their kingdoms and swords into his
hand, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 17. God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his
will, and to agree, and give their Kingdoms unto the Beast:
The principall Kings of Christendome in those dayes came
and gave their power to the beast, and by their power he was
able to do wonders against all.</P>
<P>A second reason and cause of his power to war against the
Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> was, because of the prosperous successe which they had
in the warre against Christians a hundred yeares before, and
that was in an expedition of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloign</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> and
Duke <HI>Dalbo,</HI> that went forth to recover the holy Land (as
they call it) to overcome the Turks and Sarazens, and <HI>God∣frey
Bullen,</HI> a Christian Prince, as they call him, they made
him King at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there he continued, and prospered
mightily in this war, and held it for many years together:
and Christian Princes seeing the prosperous successe of this
War which he had raised up to recover the holy Land, and
the Sepulchre of Christ; therefore upon the same tearms that
he did procure that Expedition against Infidels, he doth pro∣cure
warre against these Hereticks, and out of the same noti∣on
there were gathered an innumerable company.</P>
<P>A third Reason was from the zealous Sermons of Fryars
and Monks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> exciting all Christendom to this Warr under the
Standard of the Crosse in promise of equall pardon, as if the
Expedition had been against the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> thence came he to
make such authority to make Warre with the Saints, that if
he call for it, it is done: He agrees upon it in his own Coun∣cell,
and he gives instruction to all Abbots and Fryars, and
Governours of religious Orders, that they should send out
chiefe Preachers to call upon all the people, as in <HI>Psal. 94.
16. Who wil rise up for me against the evill doers? or who will stand
up for me against the workers of Iniquity?</HI> Sometimes complay∣ning
of the slacknesse of men to holy zeale for Gods glory,
and maintenance of purity of Religion, and sometimes a
necessity of taking part with those that are Infidels abroad,
and Hereticks and Schismaticks at home; They found their
Explication amounting to that use, that whereas there had
<PB N="102" REF="56"/>
been many Hereticks nestled up in this Countrey, therefore
it pleased him and the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> to stirre up the Bishop of
<HI>Rome</HI> to vouchsafe the like plenary pardon to those which
would go to warre against these Hereticks, as those which
had prevailed against Infidels; and the premise of pardon did
so farre prevail, that they shortly gathered together 300000.
that in hope of plenary pardon of sinne did give up them∣selves
to go on upon their owne charges; they would sell
goods and Lands for pardon of sin, and peace of conscience:
And in those dayes men were wont to be troubled at the Ser∣mons
of the Fryars and Monkes, and never found setled
peace by pardon from Christ Jesus, and never thought to
look for pardon where it was: and they told them it was to
be had by bestowing their goods and lands thus; and those
Fryars and Monks did so inculcate and drive the nayl to the
head in the hearts of people, that they were never at rest till
they went about this Expedition, there were raised a matter
of ten Captains, <HI>Simon Munford</HI> was one, a notable instru∣ment
for the Devill and this great Beast.</P>
<P>The last Reason was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 4.</NOTE> the superstition of those times, the
deep devotion and dejection of spirit that was in the bodies
of Christians in those dayes in regard of their spiritual estate:
They being deepely convinced of sinne, and sharply reproved
by the Fryars and Monks, who had a notable dexterity to
sting the consciences of men, and wound them by the terrour
of Gods wrath, sometimes for their great exactions, some∣times
for their incest; sometimes for their whoredome, and
neglect of the Ordinances of the Church; and they had things
so full against them, that it made them strictly devout, and so
were taken up in devotion to this great Beast, and the head
of it, that all the world admired and adored him for his ad∣mirable
and transcendant power, and keyes that he had to
heaven (as they thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) they all yeelded themselves, some
their bodies to fight, and some that had not sufficient to
maintaine themselves, other good Catholicks were ready to
cast in some more, some lesse, to maintaine them, according
to their abilities, and happy he that could make something
to make warre aginst these Hereticks: So that lay all these
<PB N="103" REF="56"/>
together, and you will see how he had this great power to
make war with the Saints. Here was a great and vast change
from the Institution of Christ, who confined all Churches in∣to
one Congregation, <HI>that all may heare, and all may be edefi∣ed,</HI>
that one Parish Church should grow to that vastnesse, to
levy 300000. to the warre, and that by a word of his mouth
to have them all mayntained without grudging, for every
man did thinke the worke as pious, a marvellous change:
and well doth the holy Ghost say, <HI>Hee had great power,</HI> that
the power of that Church should reach over all Churches,
and shall have such an influence into Kings, that look what
they shall dictate, all shall be ready, body, and goods, and
life, and all to maintain them; you see the reasons of it, how
he comes by this power.</P>
<P>But secondly, how comes he to make War against the
Saints?</P>
<P>There is a double reason for that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> one is taken from
the profession, and practice, and conversation of these
Saints: This was their practice, <HI>They followed the Lamb,</HI> as in
the next Chapter; <HI>I looked, and loe a lambe stood on the mount Sion,
and with him an hundred fourty and four thousand, having his Fa∣thers
name written in their foreheads: These are they which are not
defiled with women, for they are Virgins: These are they which
follow the Lamb whether soever he goeth:</HI> They kept themselves
undefiled of this Antichrist of <HI>Rome,</HI> were not defiled with
the whoredome of this great beast; in all things they consen∣ted
with the Doctrine of the Primitive Church, and their hy∣pocrisies,
and whoredomes, and coveteousnesse, were things
that would by no means be borne; therefore the Pope, who
was the great head, discerning he was thus contested against,
and (as they say) blasphemed, he thinks he does nothing,
though he destroy <HI>Turkes,</HI> and <HI>Sarazens,</HI> and <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and
whoever took the Sepulcher of Christ, as long as those Here∣tickes
at home were not subdued, therefore he thinks it as me∣ritorious
a worke to subdue them, as ever to fight for the ho∣ly
Land. But there was another thing that made the war, for
no warre can be made but by levying of Forces on both
part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="57"/>
And therefore a second was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> their taking up of Armes, in
the just defence of their liberties, both of conscience and out∣ward
man: For if the Catholick Church had raised up all
these Forces, and they had quietly submitted themselves like
sheep to the slaughter, there had beene no warre then, there
had been massacres: It would have amounted to that as the
massacre in <HI>Paris,</HI> that a man did not lift up his hand, but
they were slaughtered like dogs in the street: Though they
come with fire and sword, yet unlesse they resist with fire and
sword, it cannot be said to be war: Some set in against them,
though their weaknesse caused them to presume, but it was
to weak a businesse for flesh and bloud; <HI>Wee wrestle not
against flesh and blood, but against Principalities and Powers,
and spirituall wickednesses:</HI> They which trust to flesh and
bloud shall be deceived; as these men, they stood out, and
sometimes prospered, while the Earl of <HI>Tone,</HI> and some other
Princes joyned together, though they were but few, they
prospered; but war is not one Battel or two, and in the end
they were overcome, and this Beast prevailed; and that's the
reason of the 2<SUP>d</SUP> part, how he came to make warre against
the Saints.</P>
<P>For the 3<SUP>d</SUP>, How came he to overcome them? Truly not
by strength, he had very little that way; but</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> he overcame them by their a little too much confi∣dence
in the arme of flesh: when they see the King of <HI>Aragon</HI>
set on, they come to be a little set on by the power of the
King, and a great Battell recoyled by trusting to the arme of
flesh. You read in <HI>Heb. 11. 34. That by faith the Saints waxed
valiant in Fight, turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens;</HI> but
when our faith runne in another channell, that we grow
confident not in the Lord Jesus, by trusting in him, but on
the arme of flesh; we know what is said in <HI>Jer. 17. 5. Cursed
be the man</HI> (ye though he be a good man) <HI>that trusteth in man,
and maketh flesh his arme, and whose heart departeth from the Lord:</HI>
It withers, it cannot stand against the potent Army that rise
up against them; though their enemies were never lesse in
number, nor never lesse provided, yet they prevailed more
then ever before.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="57"/>
The second Reason was, by their attention to politick and
deceitfull Treaties of peace; for when they saw the men
were good Souldiers, valient in battell, and able to fight it
out, and they found the 3000. that were to fight for plenary
pardon three years, had served out their time, and they had
got as they thought, their souls saved, they would go home
now, and they had got peace by this carnall confidence of
theirs: So they perceived this war would be troublesome,
and the Hereticks were like to prosper, therefore they gather
in the cheif Leaders to Treaties about peace, and great pitty
that such bloud should be shed; therefore for the honour of
<HI>Rome</HI> it were needfull to cease the warre, and so would draw
their cheif Leaders to firme leagues of Peace, and then they
kept their best Generals in Prison; and thus when they had
got them to yeild to their pretences, then they had their
neckes under their girdles, and their throats under their axes,
they might hew them out of measure: Insomuch that the
King of <HI>France</HI> hearing of such cruell massacre, he sent to
know what their Religion was; and though he sent expresse
charge that none of his Souldiers should offer violence to
them, yet they concealing his Letters, they went on in
massacring the poor Saints, and scattering them up and
down, in so much that they prevailed, partly by the Saints
cleaving to the arme of flesh, and by trusting their false pre∣tences.</P>
<P>And there is a third Reason mentioned in the 10. <HI>vers.</HI>
saith he, <HI>Here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints:</HI></P>
<P>It was Gods pleasure to make it the season of the Patience
of the Saints:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> It was the season wherein Antichrist should
swell to his height, and the Saints be brought low, and their
Patience be tryed to the utmost; and it being a time of the
Saints Patience, it must needs be a time of their suffering; and
suffer they did with much patience: but yet they were not
utterly exterpated, for some fled to <HI>France,</HI> and some to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and so propagated Christian Religion, which after tur∣ned
to the conversion of many, <HI>John Husse,</HI> and <HI>Jerome</HI> of
<HI>Pragues</HI> Doctrine grew and spread more, till God raised up
<HI>Luther</HI> to set forward the power of the Gospell. Thus you
see the truth of the Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="58"/>
For the use then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> First it may serve to let us see whence is
the power of waging war; for the Text saith, it was given;
<HI>To him it was given to make war with the Saints: All men cannot
receive this,</HI> as our Saviour saith in another case, <HI>but they to
whom it is given.</HI> It is not an easie matter for any to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to wage war, it requires great store of persons, and great
store of Treasury, and Fountain to maintaine both; And
besides all this, it require<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no small measure of Wisdome
and Policy to undertake such designes: all these you see
the Lord gives, and gives them to those that his soul take no
pleasure in, and to those that in his esteem are men of beastly
spirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet he gives them power to make warre: He may
blesse himself in his rule and bravery that they were able to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against Infidels, and after against Heriticks as they called
them, but indeed the Saints of God: but you see God gave
power unto this Beast, which is therefore no cause of tri∣umph
or glorying that he hath recived such a power, for
you see it may be given to these that are enemyes to the Lord
Jesus.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> observe this much, That the Lord himselfe doth
acknowledge even his poor children on Earth to be that
which is commonly by priviledge sequestred to the holy
Saints in Heaven; He calles them Saints.</P>
<P>We think Saint-ship is a peculiar priviledge to the Saints
in Heaven, when they have ended their dayes in peace and
a good conscience, then they are accounted Saints and An∣gels;
but the Lord accounts them Saints while they live
upon the Earth, whiles they are the Church Militant,
a warfaring Church; while men undertake warre against
them, and overcome them by warre, even then they are
called Saints. And which is wonderfull, Saints when they
are overcome, and that by their owne sinfulnesse; for they
loose not the Saintship, when they loose the victory. The
Lord looks at his poorest children here as Saints, though there
be a miserable body of death hang about them, that they cry
out, <HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this Body
of Death,</HI> Rom. 7. 24. Yea though they complain of their
Pride, and Passion, and Lusts, and Hypocrysie, and many of∣fences
<PB N="107" REF="58"/>
they finde against themselves, though they think them∣selves
more flesh then any, though they thinke themselves
(as <HI>Paul</HI> did) <HI>Carnall, sold under Sinne, (Rom. 7. 17.)</HI>
yet then the Lord accounts them Saints when they are en∣compassed
about with a body of Sin:</P>
<P>Yea which is worse then that, when they give way to their
own Sinnes for a time, and doe withdraw their confidence
from the Lord in this and that act, and put their trust in the
arme of flesh: When they are so childish as to trust Popish
pretences, when they are warred against, and overcome by
enemies, and by their own folly; as <HI>David</HI> saith in <HI>Psal. 69.
5. O God, thou knowest my foolishnesse, and my Sinnes are not hid
from thee.</HI> The Lord knew it, but yet he did not know it to
hurt them, and loath them, and dishearten them: but yet they
are Saints, and such as he account to be his, and not onely in
regard of Regeneration, and the holinesse of Christ, but in
regard of the fruits of holinesse begun in them, as he saith,
<HI>Rev. 14. 4. These are they which are not defiled with women.</HI> They
are sincere in their course, and keep faith and a good consci∣ence
in the main, and where they do fail, they judge them∣selves:
Indeed in darknesse of Temptation they may be
surprised, but they judge themselves for it, and God looks at
them as though they were without fault before his Throne;
when it comes to the Throne of God, the Lord Jesus covers
it with the Robe of his Righteousnesse; and in the intenti∣ons
of their hearts and endeavours they are according to
God; if they be carried aside, it is by humane frailty.</P>
<P>Now this is comfort that the Lord accounts them Saints
when they are warred against, (as here in the Text)
and all the world thinks it a matter justly deserving Salvati∣on
to shed their bloud like water, then doth the Lord beare
witnesse they are Heriticks. So that let every christian soul
carry this home with him, that it is not every act of unbeleif
that makes a man no Saint, for these trusted too much upon
the forces of others, and if they had prevailed, for God never
failes any that put their trust in him; never do the Saints
fail in any expedition to men but when they faile in trust to
God, 1 <HI>John 5. 4. This is the victory that overcometh the world,
<PB N="108" REF="59"/>
even our Faith:</HI> He that believeth in the Sonne of God for
Redemption and Protection, and turnes not asside, whether
he go forth with many, or with few, it is all one for that; if
it were but <HI>David</HI> with a sling and a stone, he shall prevaile a∣gainst
<HI>Goliah:</HI> The Lord is faithfull, never did any faithfull
soul perish till his faith failed and shrunk; and then when
<HI>Peters</HI> faith shrinks, he begins to sinck. But it may be a ground
of much consolation to any Saint of God, the Lord doth not
dissaint a man, or cast him out of the Catalogue of Saints for
this and that failing, but still they are Saints, a Saint in
peace, and a Saint in warre, even when they are overcome;
when they are in calamity, and the plowers plow upon their
backes, and make large furrows, they are the Saints of God,
still leaning to the Voice and Councell of the Lord; and
when they start asside to Popish pretences: Onely when they
cleave to the Lord, and trust steadfastly upon him, then they
prosper and flourish; but if they begin to shrink in their
faith, and to harken to pretences and terms of peace, then
wonder not if you see them overcome, yet still faith is invin∣cible,
and their cause and Religion is propagated by their dis∣pertion,
it was not destroyed. And therefore if the Lord ac∣counts
us Saints, it behooves us to be ashamed of every passage
of our lives that doth not become the Saints of God. When
Religion came low, and Antichrist overspread the world, the
Lord accounted his faithfull ones to be Saints; in this battel
there was a Generation of Saints whom he owns: and there∣fore
how much more should we that live in dayes of peace
and liberty, bring forth fruits of holinesse in our conversati∣on,
that the Lord may account us his Saints whoever came to
make war against us.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> this may serve to teach us the lawfulnesse of chri∣stians
waging warre in their own just defence. You see it e∣vident
here, the Beast did make warre against the Saints, and
did overcome them at length, though at first the Saints over∣came
them, and killed divers of them; they stood upon their
own defence, and it it is not laid to their charge, but still
they are accounted Saints while they make warre: It is true,
their confidence in the arme of flesh, and listning to Popish
<PB N="109" REF="59"/>
pretences was an argument of weaknesse, and timerousnesse,
but it was not their failing to resist: and had they not heark∣ned
to those suggestions brought to them by those that lye in
wait to deceive; had they not leaned to humane policy, and
trusted to humane strength, they had certainly prospered. It
is true indeed, when the Laws of a State are armed against Re∣ligion,
though christians be fewer, or more in number, they
are to submit, and not take up armes; and that was the
constant practice of the Primitive Church, the Laws of the
Empire being for Idolatry, they willingly suffered, though
they were more then the rest. Or secondly, when the Laws
of a State are ordayned for Religion, private christians must
lift up their hands, to right the abuse of the Laws, and there∣fore
<HI>David</HI> being a private person, he would not lift up his
hand against <HI>Saul,</HI> the Lords Annointed, though he did a∣gainst
Law. But yet neverthelesse, if the Law be for the
maintenance of Peace and Trueth, and true Religion; and
Governours and Princes will against Law, and beyond Law,
and consequently against the Oath which themselves have
taken to maintain the Laws and Religion, if they will make
warre against the Saints, and Religion, and Truth, or against
the way of Justice and happinesse, which they are sworn to
maintain; now in such a case as this, It is as lawfull to take
up armes of defence, as it was for these men to take up war in
their own just defence.</P>
<P>Now they are not private persons, but in the place of the
Country: The Lord he put the power of the sword into the
head of their Guides &amp; Leaders where they lived; and though
they were by former Lawes engaged by way of Homage, yet
now they may take up the sword of their own defence and
maintenance, in witnesse bearing to the Truth to the last
bloud: In such cases the case is much altered, for their Prin∣ces
and supream Governours, they are all subject to the Laws
and Oath of the Kingdome, and they have no power but ac∣cording
to the Lawes which are made: If therefore they
take up a power against Law, and contest with the people of
God, then this power which these holy men did exercise to
maintain their peace against all opposition to be raised against
them is lawfull.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="60"/>
For a fourth use;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> it may teach all the people of God not
to measure a cause by the event, nor persons by accidents
that do befall them, lest they should condemn the generati∣on
of the Just. It was a grievous temptation <HI>Asaph</HI> lay un∣der,
to see the ungodly prosper, and have what their hearts
could desire, and himselfe plagued all the day long, <HI>and
chastned every morning,</HI> Psal. 73. 3. to 13. and by this meanes
he condemned the generation of Gods children: But no mat∣ter
though the Beast prosper, and the Saints are overcome,
yet the Beast is a Beast when he prospers, and the Saints are
Saints, though they be overcome; therefore let us not judge
of things according to their appearance.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 5.</NOTE> It may teach all the Saints in this Countrey, or
where-ever, not to trust the pretences of deceitfull men, es∣pecially
such as are not sound in Religion, and take heed
also how you trust upon your own strength (let me put them
both together for brevity sake): We know not how soon a∣ny
of us may be tempted in this kind, what warres may be
raised against this Countrey (though wee have none for the
present, nor feare none) yet in time we know not what may
come: what, are we better then our Fathers? The Beast of
<HI>Rome</HI> still lives, his 42. moneths is not yet out (though his
power he much weakned) but his Agents still live: He is a∣ble
to blow a coale to those that look for salvation from
him, to do this great and glorious service to the Catholick
Church and cause: And if it please the Catholick Church,
then it grows a great businesse to root out Hereticks, to blast
them by censures of Excommunication, and Civill State; if
it were so, we stand upon our own defence you see. It be∣hooves
you therefore, as you desire to be faithfull to God, to
Religion, to your Churches and Common-wealths, to your
Wives, Children, Estates, as you desire to be faithfull to his
Ordinances, to the Kingly, Priestly, and Propheticall Of∣fice
of Christ, to attend to that which these Saints neglected,
that is to say, to attend to the word of Faith, and to the
wisdome of God: Trust not upon the experience of your
Captaines or Souldiers, to fight by Land or Sea: Trust not
upon your Castles or Vessels by Sea, any thing you have, or
<PB N="111" REF="60"/>
may have: Trust not upon the pieces of Ordnance, they are
all vaine things to save if you stand in need (and yet of use.)
Be prepared in this kind, that you may be instrumentall to
Gods providence, but trust not in them, they are but the
Arm of flesh: And if Wars come against <HI>New-England,</HI> it will
be from <HI>Principalities and Powers,</HI> and flesh and blood will not
be able to with-stand them: They will be Principalities from
Hell, or the great Beast, the Catholick Church, or from the
Image of this Beast, otherwise there is no feare of any War:
but if any War do come, trust not in those means you have,
nor though all the Natives in the Countrey were on your
side: and if any great Protestant States should offer you help,
use them, but do not trust in them. It was the way of over∣coming
the Saints of God, they trusted on the arm of Flesh,
and that was their great folly, and that brought the hand of
God against them; therefore see your Faith be sincere, and
upright to him.</P>
<P>Secondly, Leane not to the wisdome of carnall reason,
nor trust not to faire pretences, you shall have your liberties
longer established, only something or other you must give
way to, and some principall ones must be singled out to
treat of peace, but it was the ruine of this State: It behoves
the Saints to sanctifie God in their hearts, to trust upon his
grace, to cleave to the word of God; trust what the Lord
saith, and not what deceitful men say: It was a grave saying
of an ancient Prince in <HI>England; Obey according to the Law, and
you obey the King: but if you obey what comes suddenly out of his
mouth, or against Law, you obey not me as King:</HI> And that is it
which Christian Religion teacheth; no Religion teaches a
man more to obey Kings in wholsome Laws; to obey them,
it to obey God in them, for Princes are subordinate to God
himselfe. The people do concur in making some Laws in e∣very
Common-wealth, and Princes have transcendant pow∣er
over the People; and God forbid any should spring out of
this Countrey to plead against their Governours, and wea∣ken
their forces, but keep their Scepters fresh from one Gene∣ration
to another; yet this is the best service done to Kings,
service according to God: If Laws be made, let a man yield
<PB N="112" REF="61"/>
active obedience to them, if they be good, and passive if they
be evill; but against Law, contrary to the stream of Law, to
make a man think himselfe bound, in such a case it is to flat∣ter
Princes and Powers, and not to yeeld professed subjection
to them. Therefore it behoves the people of God to know
upon what terms they stand, that wee may carry our selves
like loyall Subjects and Christians, that the name of God
may not be dishonoured by any weaknesse of ours, and start∣ing
aside on any hand or other.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Rev. 13. latter part of the 7. vers.</BIBL>
<Q>And power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues,
and Nations.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WEe come now to the fourth thing which these words
hold forth, and that is the power (or as the Greek
word hath it) the authority which is here sayd to
be given to the Roman Catholick Church, and that is, <HI>over
all Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations.</HI></P>
<P>The note is this,</P>
<P>To the Roman Catholicke visible Church was given very ample
jurisdiction and authority over all the Christian world (if we may so
speake) or as in the Text,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctr. 4.</NOTE> over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Na∣tions.</P>
<P>And he meanes Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations of such
Countreys which were wont to be subject to the Empire of
<HI>Rome,</HI> which were then counted all the Civill Nations of
the world.</P>
<P><HI>To open it briefly:</HI> It was given him over all kindreds, tongues,
and nations.</P>
<P>Here are three words, and one include another: Nation is
the largest; for in a Nation there may be many Tongues,
and in one Tongue there may be many Kindreds. He had
dominion and soveraignty over all Nations, or over the ten
Kings; that is to say, the body of Christian Princes, and all
the Nations subject to them, they all gave their power unto
the Beast, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 17. No nation professed Christianity, but
professed also subjection to the Sea of <HI>Rome,</HI> that is, to the
Romon Catholick visible Church: And the Papists are large
in this; <HI>Bellarmine</HI> makes it a 4<SUP>th.</SUP> note of the visible Church,
amplitude of power, and he gives sundry instances: Stories
are evident, that all Nations did professe this Religion (spe∣cially
after the subduing of the <HI>Waldences,</HI> though they did
before) setting aside that remnant of the womans seed that
<PB N="114" REF="62"/>
were fled into the wildernesse: Now no Nation in Christen∣did
professe other Religion then Popery, especially from
the time of <HI>Charls</HI> the Great, to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, which was
a matter of 720. years: There was no visible profession open,
unlesse in some secret corners of the world: no Nation held
forth any other Religion then Popish, nor professed subjecti∣on
to any other Church. Now in every Nation there are, or
may be divers Tongues, as in <HI>England,</HI> you have the English,
and Welsh, and Cornish Tongues, besides others that are
discrepant from <HI>English:</HI> But he saith not only every Nation,
but every Tongue, that is, every Language, they all gave
their power to the Beast: And in every Tongue we have ma∣ny
Kindreds, and there is no man that could ever say but
some of his kindred have been Popish, or are Popish to this
day, if not all, yet some of the ancientest, and those the grea∣ter
part, here is the universality of it.</P>
<P>And (I say) further, he had ample and great power; for
to have power over all argues amplitude. It is said in the be∣ginning
of the 8 <HI>vers.</HI> (which I will take in, and open here)
it is said, <HI>They shall worship him:</HI> That's a great power when it
doth amount to inward worship, not civill, but divine wor∣ship.
It was divine worship that he challenged, and all Na∣tions
gave him. To give Laws of faith, and worship, and go∣vernment
to all Churches in Christendom, that was divine
power peculiar to the Lord Jesus. It was divine power to
challenge toihimselfe imposition of Kings, and deposition of
Kings without consent of the people: To provoke the people
to do it whether they liked their Prince or no, this is tran∣scendant
above all created power. Besides, it was divine
worship they gave, in giving him power over their Conscien∣ces,
challenging to himself (and they also yeelding freely)
a power to bind Conscience with the Laws he gave them, to
loose their consciences either from the Laws of God, in mat∣ter
of Oaths; to loose them from guilt of sinne, to loose
their consciences from Contracts, from Confederacies, this
is divine power; <HI>They all worship him, whose names are not writ∣ten
in the booke of the Lamb,</HI> and some of them too for a sea∣son,
but they continue not, God opens their eyes to repent
<PB N="115" REF="62"/>
of it, and to rise from under it. It was divine power to cha∣lenge
infalibility of Judgment, to judg of Scripture out of the
Oracle of his owne braines: These were all divine worship
they gave to the Catholick Church, and to the head of it, the
Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI> So that marvayl not (as the Text saith)
<HI>there was given,</HI> Exasia, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> not a lame power, but an unli∣mited
power over all people in Church and Common-wealth,
and over conscience. There is nothing wherein the
Catholick Church had not power throughout all Christen∣dome.</P>
<P>Now further, the Text tells you, <HI>All this power was given:</HI>
He did not wholly arrogate this power to him (though he
did so too) but it was given him, though he took it, and
took all advantages to get it. <HI>No man can receive any thing, ex∣cept
it be given him from above.</HI> But he had it given him: Gi∣ven
him, by whom? by God, by the Devill, and given him
by Christian Kings, Churches, and Common-wealths, and
Families.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> it was given by God in his just judgment: <HI>God gave
them up to delusions to believe lyes,</HI> 2 Thes. 2. 11. And he gave
two reasons why God gave them up to those delusions.</P>
<P>1. To avenge their want of entertainment of the truth in
love. <HI>Because they received not the love of the truth that they
might be saved,</HI> vers. 10. 12. Because they would not receive
Christ, nor the simplicity of his government and worship (in
Church-state) therefore God gave them up to Satan, and to
the man of sinne, and to the Catholicke visible Roman
Church.</P>
<P>2. <HI>That they all might be damned that have pleasure in unrighte∣ousnesse,</HI>
in the same verse. The Lord gave them up therefore
to damnable distempers, damnable usurpations and Ord∣nances;
the Lord gave them up for these two Reasons, and
they are one subordinate to another.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> this power was given by Satan also. For it is
said, <HI>The coming of Antichrist shall be after the working of Satan,
with all powers, and signes, and lying wonders, and with all deceive∣ablenesse
of unrighteousnesse,</HI> 2 Thes. 2. 9, 10. By the efficacy of
delusion, which was by the jugling of those great men in
<PB N="116" REF="63"/>
those times, for efficacy of delusion is by miracles, so by de∣ceivablenesse
of unrighteousnesse, which is three-fold; The
sophistry of Schoolmen, the policy of the Canonists that
made their Laws out of the Popes decrees, still advancing the
Popish Church, and the head thereof, partly by the devotion
of Monks and Fryars: And if you aske why Satan did this,
there is a double reason of that.</P>
<P>First, to revenge the injury which the Church did him by
bringing forth a Man-child, a Christian Emperour to depose
him from his glory, wherein he was worshipped as the great
God of the world. Now when hee sees hee is cast off from the
honour he had, <HI>and there was no more place left for him in heaven,</HI>
it comes to passe that he pours forth a flood of barbarous na∣tions
and damnable Heresies after the woman, and makes war
with the remnant of her seed, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. 13. 15.</P>
<P>2. A second Reason that stirred up Satan, was out of the
ancient enmity against Christ, and the seed of Christ, <HI>Gen. 3.
15. I will put enmity between thy seed and her seed,</HI> which is
Christ; and all the seed of Christ, which are both publique
and private Christians, he hath an inveterate enmity against
them all; and therefore he gives the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> all the
power that Pagan <HI>Rome</HI> had.</P>
<P>The third sort of givers of this large power to this Beast,
and the head of it, the Pope was.</P>
<P>The voluntary devotion of Christian Princes and States.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE>
They did voluntarily resign themselves up, and their King∣doms,
and States, and Churches, and Common-wealth, and
Consciences and all, to the obedience of the Sea of <HI>Rome,
Rev. 17. 17. They with one accord gave their Kingdomes to the
Beast;</HI> God put it into their hearts to do it; that is true, but
they were left of God, and acted by Satan, and so were they
brought about to give this power unto the Beast. Some were
brought unto this by the Popes favour, and large gifts he be∣stowed
upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the Great had his Empire from the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and translated it from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI>
and therefore he had reason to stand to the Authority that
set him up. And the ten Kings of Christendom that rose up∣on
<PB N="117" REF="63"/>
the demolition of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire, which was then
called the Empire of <HI>Rome,</HI> their absolute authority did
much depend upon the Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> if the <HI>Grecian</HI> Empire
had not yeelded, they had been liable in conscience to restore
these ten Kingdoms: In point of State-policy, they had cause
to be much observant to the Pope: But that is not all, for
they could never have done it, had not the Subjects yeelded:
And what moved them? Truly they were all taken with the
Religion of the man of sinne: That flood of Heresies and Ab∣hominations
which the Catholick Church did hold forth
(as in a cup of poyson to the world) these earthly sort of
Christians swallowed it all up. They were carnall, and yet
superstitious and devout: Carnall, for want of saving grace
and regeneration: And devout, for then generally Christians
lay under the terrour of the Law, as in <HI>Rev. 9. 5, 6. The lo∣custs
came in,</HI> which were the Fryars and Monkes, and they
had this power to sting their Consciences even to the death,
that a man would give all he had for pardon of sinne: Now
having power to sting mens Consciences, but not to heale
them; to kill, but not to make alive, they were now fitted
to receive the Impression of the Popish Religion; and that re∣ligion
to men so qualified and disposed, was fit to heal them
overly, and to skin the wound of Conscience; and there are
three things in that Religion that helped to skinne over the
Conscience.</P>
<P>1. The suitablenesse of it to humane and naturall sences.</P>
<P>2. To carnall naturall reason.</P>
<P>3. To naturall Conscience.</P>
<P>For these three concur, and that strongly in this Religion,
to carry all Christendome after it.</P>
<P>First, for naturall sense: All that have travayled into Po∣pish
Countreys know that their Religion is composed to na∣turall
sence.</P>
<P>1. To satisfie the eyes with goodly Images, and Pictures,
and gorgeous Temples, and Vestures, that young and
old are taken with these goodly spectacles.</P>
<P>2. For the eares; you know in their Cathedralls what cu∣rious
musique they have, both vocall and instrumentall.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="64"/>
3. For the smell, you have Incense and sweet perfumes to
entertaine you.</P>
<P>4. For the taste, you have double Feasts and solemn Feasts,
many Feasts full of luxury and ryot.</P>
<P>5. For the Touch; there is toleration of Stews, to give up
their names to Stews: They will not suffer men to
live, unlesse they give up their names to be free of such
unclean houses: And if you commit any lewdnesse,
then it is easie to come off with some light penanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;
and especially the purse, that will doe all. These
things marvellously please the sense.</P>
<P>Secondly, for naturall Reason, it suits marvellously with
naturall reason.</P>
<P>1. To hold forth an historical &amp; implicite faith▪ Historical
the Devils may have: and implicite, for a man to be∣lieve
as the Church believes, and hee believes this Faith
hath power to quench all temptations of the Devill.</P>
<P>2. To hold forth such a repentance as consists in Contri∣tion,
Confession, and Satisfaction; <HI>Judas</HI> reached all
this: For contrition, his heart was humbled in sence of
his sinne. For confession, <HI>I have sinned in betraying inno∣cent
blood:</HI> And for satisfaction; <HI>He brought again the thir∣ty
pieces of silver;</HI> He would not meddle nor make with
them.</P>
<P>3. To hold forth such an obedience as a man may be able
to perform and keep the whole Law of God, which he
thinks to be easie: And this doth please naturall Sence
to work our own salvation.</P>
<P>4. To hold forth pardon of sin for money, and for bodily
exercises.</P>
<P>5. Uncertainty of Salvation.</P>
<P>6. Such a frame of Church-government as keepeth all in a
politick order and unity: That all Popish Churches be
subordinate to such a Bishop, as he is to some Metropo∣litan,
and they to some Primate, and all to the Bishop of
<HI>Rome.</HI> And why? From one unity ascends, and it is
good to keep unity: And so to look at a mans selfe as
unworthy to come into the presence of God, and to call
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>
upon Christ, and therefore manners would make a man
cleave to some he-Saints or she-Saints, and they shall
present their prayers to Christ, and Christ to the Father,
which is very plausable to naturall reason: And for our
Fathers which grew zealous of that Religion, we should
not damn them to hell, Reason abhors that.</P>
<P>Thirdly, for naturall Conscience; it will counter-work
with God, and walk in equipage with God all the way, that
is to say, for a man to look to find according to his works,
natural Conscience hath this in Nature, it is ingrafted in na∣ture
from the God of <HI>Adam,</HI> from his Ordinance in Nature,
or the rudements of it restored.</P>
<P>1. Election of Faith, or works foreseen.</P>
<P>2. Redemption of all men alike.</P>
<P>3. Conversion by the power of free-will. This is in
the natures of all men, by the very Law and works of
Nature.</P>
<P>4. Justification by works, naturall Conscience dictates
that; <HI>Do this and thou shalt live;</HI> do it not, and thou dost
forfeit the favour of God; but receive it, and thou hast
fellowship with God.</P>
<P>5. Perseverance by our owne endeavours.</P>
<P>6. Glorification by merits of works.</P>
<P>All these suit with naturall Conscience, that Conscience
is satisfied if the work be accomplished; if not, then they make
satisfaction: If they faile in these works by giving way to
this o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that arrogance that the work is not compleat, then
Conscience hangs in some dispence and demur: And if they
cannot satisfie all in this world, yet they should do what
they can by giving to this and that good use, and do pen∣nance
for their sinne: And if all faile, they may make satis∣faction
in Purgatory, and not sink downe to the nether most
Hell: These things be very acceptable to naturall Consci∣ence.
Thus we see how it comes to passe, that to this Beast
was given authority and power over all Kindreds, Tongues,
and Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> You will say to me, But doth not this crosse some other Text,
in <HI>Rev.</HI> 5. 9. where it is said, the Lord hath redeemed his people out
<PB N="120" REF="65"/>
of every Kindred, and Tongue, and Nation? If the Pope had this power
over every Kindred, Tougue, and Nation, where stands Christs re∣demption?</P>
<P>I answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE> for Christs Redemption, it is some out of every
Kindred, Tongue, and Nation, <HI>whose names are written in the
Lambs booke of life,</HI> but it was but a remnant: There is at
this time a remnant <HI>according to the Election of Grace,</HI> Rom.
11. 5. But otherwise all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations
have been swallowed up by the usurpation of this Beast, and
by their subjection to him: So that Christ hath his number
out of all these; but it is the Beast that carryes away the bo∣dy
of them, for that season especially: He did rule over
them by a kinde of sacred Authority, in the consciences of
men, because he had this absolute power in Churches, a great
power for 1260. years together: whether you reckon from
<HI>Constantines</HI> time, or <HI>Theodosius</HI> his time, he had a marvellous
power in Kingdomes, Nations, and Common-wealths. But
notwithstanding he had this power in those times, yet Christ
kept the interest in his own chosen, as in <HI>Rev.</HI> 14. 1. where
he had 144000. that were spotlesse virgins.</P>
<P><HI>Answ. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The Lord Jesus will at length challenge all his
own, purchase them into his own hand, when at the calling
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> all the Kingdomes of the world shall be given to
the Saints of the most high, <HI>Dan.</HI> 7. 26, 27. The Lord will
take them all into his own hand, and power and jurisdiction,
but he must first throw down this enemy that hath usurped o∣ver
his purchased possession: But in the mean time this Beast
swallows up all for so many Ages together.</P>
<P>For the use of the point.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> it may be to refute the Papists that give this as a true
note of the Church, namely, amplitude of dominion, as the
Catholick Church had: They give this for an infallible
note of the Church; now that note you see is here evidently
ascribed to the people that worship the great Beast, of whom
the Lord saith here <HI>(ver. 8.) their names are not written in the
booke of the Lamb.</HI> So that this is a note, not of an Apostoli∣call
Church, but it may be a note of an Apostaticall Church
that is fallen away from the Apostles Doctrine: It is a true
<PB N="121" REF="65"/>
description of that State of the Church. You see here <HI>Power
was given over to the Beast over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nati∣ons:</HI>
And therefore amplitude of dominion is not an inse∣perable
character of the Spouse of Christ; for it may be given
to those that are not the Church of Christ, even to those
that are but a Beast in the sight of God, not his Spouse. I
may rather say the contrary, that amplitude of Dominion
was never a note of a Church of Christ since the world began:
For in the old Testament the State of the Church was Nati∣onall,
and they had power over one Nation, and sometimes
conquered others, as in <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Solomons</HI> time, they con∣quered
the <HI>Philistims,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ammonites,</HI> and <HI>Moabites,</HI> and <HI>Edomites,</HI>
but it was never over all the whole world, and that dominion
which they had, they did not challenge it by Church power,
but left them still to their own Religion, for the Common-wealth
propagated their power by arms, having first occasi∣on
of warre given them by their arrogance to them. In the
dayes of the new Testament, the Church that Christ instituted
reacheth no further then to their own members, and their
own members reach no further then to one Congregation,
<HI>that all might hear, and all might be edefied, 1 Cor.</HI> 14. 23. So
that if Church power extends no further then the bounds of
one Congregation; then that Church that swelleth and stre∣cheth
forth her power all the world over, Kindreds, and
Tongues, and Nations; what an out-ragious swelling Beast
is that, that reacheth such vast dominion beyond the pro∣portion
that the Lord gave to his Church? If you should
see a body swell to such a vast bignesse, that his armes shall
reach from one end of the world to another, would it not be
counted a monster? So in this case, the Lord hath limited
the power of the Church within it selfe; it is a great power
that they have, but not so great as to binde conscience, unless
it be Ministerially, and so they have power to binde Kings
in chains, and Nobles in lincks of Iron; but to have power,
judiciary power over the Scriptures, and over the conscience,
over and above the application of the word; it is such as the
Lord never gave to any Church, but it is arrogated, and usur∣ped
by the man of Sinne.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="66"/>
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> it may serve to teach you the prouenesse of your
natures to that which is evill, above that which is savingly
and spiritually good. This power over all Kindreds, and
Tongues, and Nations, <HI>the Lord hath purchased by his death,</HI> Rev.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 9. <HI>He dyed and rose againe that he might be Lord both of quick
and dead,</HI> Rom. 14. 9. And upon his resurrection, all power
was given him in Heaven and Earth, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 18. He prayed
for this power, and the Lord promised to give him it. <HI>Psal.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8. Aske of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheri∣tance;
and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy Possession.</HI> This
hath the Lord bought with his pretious bloud, and paid for
by the power of his eternall Spirit; and yet never did the
Lord Jesus enjoy this power to this day, which the man of
Sinne hath enjoyed for so many years together. He will en∣joy
it at lenght, when he shall call in the <HI>Jews,</HI> and with
them the fulnesse of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and reigne in Soveraigne
Authority both in Church and Common-wealth, according
to all the Councell of his word and will: But yet it was ne∣ver
known to this day that so many Nations did submit
their thrones to the Dominion and Government of Christ,
and to the Truth of Christ, and to worship him with the ser∣vants
of God, notwithstanding the purchase which Christ
hath made of this Soveraignty, and notwithstanding the
efficacy of his prayer for obtaining this power, that hee
might have dominion over all. As soon as <HI>Constantine</HI>
brought the world to become Christian, the woman she fled
into the Wildernesse: The true worshippers of Christ were
soon troden under the hatches, a mountaine of corruption
in Church Government overwhelmed them amain, that you
cannot set the time when so many Nations served him, and
were as ready to take up arms in his quarrell, as they have
done for the man of Sinne.</P>
<P>You will say, did they not for the recovery of the holy
Land, many Churches conspire and lay their heads together,
and engaged themselves for this Warre? why, when they
they undertook that Warre, was it Christ that commanded
any such thing, that Churches should engage themselves,
and their Estates, and Lives, and Souls, and all for the reco∣very
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>
very of the holy City; was it not meerly undertaken by the
Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and by the motion of the Catholick Church
in a Generall Councell? The Roman Catholick Church
met in a Generall Councell, and they agreed to set about
this expedition; They promised pardon of Sinne to the peo∣ple,
and in hope of that, and such like things they went a∣bout
it. It was service to the Beast, not to Christ: God ne∣ver
acknowledgeth it as any service to Christs Kingdome: It
was for the advancement of the head of the catholick Church▪
but as any grew more wise, they grew more afraid of them.</P>
<P>So that it is a wonder to see; never did the the Christian
world give that Authority to Christ, as they have done unto
the Pope, and his Institutions, which are not Ordinances of
Christ. Yea let me say another word (which is above what
I said:) It hath been a very rare and singular case when any
man would acknowledge a particular visible Church, depen∣ding
on no power, but Independant within it selfe: It is
such a rarity that a man may here and there indeed finde it in
times of persecution (in 3000. years): But after the Church
come to peace, it is very rare to heare such a matter till you
come down to the <HI>Waldences,</HI> and <HI>Albedences,</HI> and those poor
Churches that were scattered in the Wildernesse. It is very
hard to finde the Church of Christs Institution to remain in
the world, whereas this Roman Catholick Church reigns in
the world: This is a great power, and yet this power the
Church of <HI>Rome</HI> had. The Harlot reigns over Kindreds,
Tongues, and Nations, whereas the true Spouse of Christ
hath scarce a subsistance in the world.</P>
<P>So that consider, if it did not smite with our hearts to
close with the Inventions of men, with satanicall power ra∣ther
then with Christ, it were not possible there should be
such aberations from the Institutions of Christ, were it
not for the impetuous licentiousnesse of the hearts of the
Sonnes of men. And therefore when there is such a vast
swelling, that many Congregations shall be but one Church;
how shall we go home edefied by such discourse? This be∣longes
to all the Churches, to take the opportunities that we
have, that we may not runne headlong upon the devices of
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>
men, or our owne wits, to that which is suitable to sence,
and naturall reason, and walking according to the light of
naturall conscience. Conscience was never so corrupt as in
corrupt nature it is; and reason never so blinde as in corrupt
nature it is, and sence never so luxurious. A man is ready
to please sence, his pallat, his nostrils, his eye, and hand, and
touch, and naturall reason, and conscience, a manis marvel∣lous
free that way; so free, that the lesse a man discerne it,
the more he is captivated to it. And therefore let every man
know that we carry about with us a principle of subjection
of our selves to the Ordinances of men rather then to Christ.
If it be to speak to our owne honour and applause, we have
words at will, and hearts that runne full stream that way;
If it were to set out our selves, or our friends, we are open
hearted, and open mouthed that way: but if it shall be to
give glory to God, in the presence of a particular visible
Church of Christs Institution, there we are marvellous un∣willing
to submit to edifie our brethren, and glorifie God. If
it were to an Ordinance of man, it is a wonder to see how
men will runne and ride to give satisfaction to this and that
Episcopal Court higher, and lower, and clear all scores
there, that we may not be debarred of Christian buriall, or
Church Communion, though it may be we cannot have it
with mixture of corruption, and can scarse close with it,
especially those that are enlightned:</P>
<P>But when we come to sanctifie God, &amp; his praise, and hol∣ding
forth our own shame, there is an inward principle in us
to consider whether it stands with our honour, and credit,
with our peace, and safety; a world of carnall reason and
conscience will worke together in this case, and inwardly so
reply, and muzzle the hearts and consciences of men, that
it is a wonder to see what shifting and daubing there is, which
they willingly give up themselves to, when they are called a∣bout
the inventions of the Sons of men.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> it may teach us, if the whole world have runthus
mad and wild, to give their Crowns and Scepters, Churches,
Common-wealths, and consciences, to have power put upon
all these of their own choise by the man of Sinne, every Kin∣dred,
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>
Tongue, and Nation: what a shame will it be if we be
not as truely devout in our Religion? as it is said of <HI>Cornelius,
Acts 10. 1. He was a devout man,</HI> a Godly man given up to
God; So should we give up our selves to the Lord, and sacri∣fice
our credit, and profit, and whatever wee have to the Lord.
There have been men that have been content to forfit all their
Kingdomes to the man of Sin; The Emperours in <HI>Germany</HI>
have given their Crowns; The Kings of <HI>England,</HI> King <HI>John</HI>
in his time did as much to the Popes Legat: And it hath
been frequent with him, to set the Crowns upon their heads,
and dash them down with his feet: These 42. moneths it
hath been frequent with them to give up their Crowns to
him, but much adoe to runne any hazard for Christ, though
a petty jurisdiction: And yet none did ever truely runne
hazard for the Lord, but the Lord took up their Crowns, and
maintayned their cause and honour, and recoverd what ho∣nour
they lost.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> by making known his Adultery, and by his repen∣tance
for it, did recover what Power and Authority he might
seem to loose in the hearts of his subjects: It is true, he had
lost his Kingdome, but was it for his Repentance? No, but
for his natural affection to his rebellious Sonne <HI>Absolom,</HI> and
his incestuous Sonne <HI>Amnon,</HI> that should have been cut off:
He lost his Crown, not for his Repentance, but for want of
executing the Law of God upon his own children, as upon
others, there was his Sinne: otherwise had he executed
judgement upon his rebellious Sonne <HI>Absolom,</HI> as the Lord re∣quired
(thou shalt pluck him from mine Altar, that Rebell)
he had not lost his Kingdome: But if so be his naturall af∣fection
over-rule him, that he doe not execute judgement,
then no marvaile though they cast him out of his Kingdome,
and cut his throat at length, if God doe not come between,
as he did to <HI>David:</HI> But belive it, no man did ever loose by
sanctifying God in his heart, by giving honour to him, and
taking shame to himselfe: The Lord hath maintained peace
in the conscience, &amp; hath given it when it hath bin wanting,
and the Lord hath been pleased to sanctifie their names, as
they have sanctified his before men; <HI>whoever shall be ashamed of
<PB N="126" REF="68"/>
me, and of my words in this adulterous and sinfull Generation, of
him also shall the Sonne of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the
Glory of his Father, with the holy Angels,</HI> Mark. 8. 38. And it
will shortly be the ruine of those things they would preserve,
the ruine of a mans name and state, the ruine of his body and
soul together, if a man shall dare in the presence of God to
give the Glory doe to his Name to a Beast: The Lord will be
a swift witnesse against all the workers of iniquity. Trust
God with your honour and estate; did he ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aile any man
to this day? <HI>Theodosius</HI> did submit himselfe, and gave glory
to God, and acknowledged his offence to <HI>Ambrose</HI> the Pastor
of his Church, and to the people of God, because he had sin∣ned
against the Lord, to the offence of the Church of God:
did it weaken his esteem? did not all the Churches hear of his
repentance? Though there were some ruffinly Captains that
would have had him cut off <HI>Ambroses</HI> head; no saith he, let
him alone, he does it out of love to God and my soul: There∣fore
with many teares, and much dejection of soul, he sancti∣fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
God in his heart, and was afterwards received againe in∣to
the Church, not onely to the great comfort of the Church
where he lived, but of all others that were under his Govern∣ment,
and he never lost the honour of his Government. No
man ever lost by submitting to the Authority of Christ, we
may trust the Lord for that: Authority is more worth then
our haires, and yet he numbers our haires, and all the com∣forts
of the world are not answerable to it: trust him with
it, as he that is faithfull, and he will certainly provide that
nothing shall be lost: commit your souls to him, as to a faith∣ful
Creator; and the Lord finding his name sanctified in it be∣fore
the people, he will certainly sanctifie us and our names
before them as we sanctifie his. Let us yeild up our selves to
the service of his Kingdome: when men have been contrary
minded, the Lord hath pursued them with fearful judgements.
You know the case of <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu, Lev.</HI> 10. 1. They
came before God with strange fire, and the Lord makes a
strange worke, and consumes them with fire. <HI>Annanias</HI> and
<HI>Saphira</HI> that dealt deceitfully with the Church, some part
they delivered, but kept back part of their substance: what
<PB N="127" REF="68"/>
followed upon that? The Lord struck them dead; you will
say, those were in those dayes in which God was neere to his
Church. Beleive it, the Lord is as neere to his Church now
(though not in miracles as then, there needs not miracles
now:) The Lord will confirme his Truth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 23. All
the Churches shall know, that I am he which searcheth the
reignes and hearts, and <HI>I will give to every one of you according
to your workes:</HI> As men deal subtilly, he will deal subtilly;
with the faithful, with plain hearted, with conscionable men,
he will deal faithfully, and all the Churches shall know it:
the Lord will not have his judicature in his Church bafled
down with partiall, and <HI>Annanias</HI> his confession. The Lord
will set his face against those men, and cut them off from the
land of the living, that shall dis-regard his throne and Crown.
And therefore it behooves all men whom it may at any time
concern, to sanctifie his name; <HI>My sonne give glory to God, and
tell me what thou hast done,</HI> Josh. 7. 19. And he ingenously
tells him from first to last, which no body ever could tell: but
saith hee, I saw among the spoiles a goodly Babilonish Gar∣ment,
and two hundred sheckels of Silver, and a wedge of
Gold of fifty sheckels weight, then I coveted them, and took
them; well saith he, thou hast troubled <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Lord
shall trouble thee: but yet this acknowledgement was the
valley of <HI>Achor</HI> for a door of hope <HI>(Hos. 2. 15.)</HI> for their
prosperity, and victory over all their enemies.</P>
<P>So that if all Nations and Languages be thus ready to sub∣mit
to the inventions of men, how justly doth the Lord chal∣lenge
due subjection to his will, to sanctifie him in our hearts,
to throw down our Crowns (if we have them) at his feet,
and glad we may do so. It is evident, <HI>Rev.</HI> 4. 10. that all
the Church, (the four Officers, and 24. Elders) they all cast
their Crowns down before him: Though they all did
weare Crowns, all had Authority, yet they cast them all
down at his feet, when they came before him that sate upon
the throne, and before the Lambe: There they stooped; In
the presence of Christ they threw down their Soveraign∣ty;
and let the name of Christ be magnified, and his Ordi∣nances
have free passage, but for them let their honour fall
down.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="69"/>
Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> let it learn us thus much, to take to heart in these
dayes the estate of our Ancestors and Fathers of old in those
dayes: For if every Kindred have worshipped the Beast, then
thy Kindred have done it, or Ancestors. We speak not in de∣derision
of them, but they have all done it, the body of them
(though here and there some may be left out) and all their
power they have given to the Beast, to rule Families, Chur∣ches,
and Common-wealths, and all our Kindred, and espe∣cially
our Tongues have done it; not onely those that speak
<HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spanish,</HI> but we have been more devoted then any
Christian Nations, in giving such vast revenues, and Monaste∣ries,
and so large devotion to the man of sinne, none have
been so devout as <HI>English:</HI> It is incredible to tell the great
payments they made to the Pope, it is not to be numbred.
And if all Tongues have submitted to the Beast, then they that
speak <HI>English,</HI> as well as those that speak <HI>Scottish,</HI> or <HI>Welsh,</HI> or
<HI>Brittish,</HI> the body of all Kindreds if not to this day.</P>
<P>It must therefore humble us in regard of this their sinne,
which will be set upon our score, unlesse the Lord humble us
for it: the contagion of their sinn reaches to us, and his jea∣lousie
will cut off root &amp; branch. Gods jealousie is kindled by
Images and superstitions; <HI>I will visit the iniquities of their Fathers
upon their children:</HI> men may suffer much for their Ancestors,
and for their Kindred, Tongues, and Nation. And therefore
it behoovs us all to be humbled for the sinne of our Ancestors;
and they hoped to be saved by the intercession of Saints,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This provokes the jealousie of God. Therefore if we
would not have our teeth set an edge by these sour Grapes, it
behooves us to be humbled, that the intaile of Gods curse may
be cut off from us though it lay heavy upon them that went
before us.</P>

<BIBL>Rev. 13. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>And all that dwell on earth shall worship him whose names
are not written in the booke of life of the Lamb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOu have heard that upon the recovery and healing of
the wounded head of the Catholick Church, sundry
effects followed; the Dragon gave unto the Beast a
four fold power, <HI>Power to speak great things, power to
continue and to be active 42. moneths, power to make warre with the
Saints and to overcome them;</HI> Power of soveraignty and Autho∣rity
over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations, and that even
to worship, that all that dwell on the Earth shall worship him,
believing as the Church believes, and neither more nor lesse,
submitting themselves in conscience to all their decrees, and
expecting their salvation in the fellowship of that Church,
which is divine worship peculiar onely to the Lord Jesus. In
the words now read, you have these that worship the Beast,
that is, that give this divine honour to the Catholick Church,
to believe as they believe, to submit their consciences to the
power of this Beast, taking up all their observations for wor∣ship,
for Government from them, not from God, and looking
for their salvation in reconcilement with this Church; I say
these men that doe thus worship this Beast, they are described
here by their state, by their spirituall and eternall state; that
is to say, they are described by a deniall of their elect estate,
and that is exprest in a deniall of the proper adjunct of that
state, and that is, the writing of their names in the Lambs
book of life, for that is the proper adjunct of all the elect peo∣ple
of God, that their names are written in the book of life of
the Lamb; these men men therefore being denied this proper
adjunct of an elect state, they are the refore here described
by their damnable condition and state; now this therefore
is here predicated of them all, that their names are not writ∣ten
in the booke of the life of the Lambe, who ever they be
that worship this Beast; and he saith, <HI>All did worship him,</HI> save
<PB N="130" REF="70"/>
onely they <HI>whose names were written in the Lambes booke of life:</HI>
They that did worship the Beast, had not their names written
in the Lambs book of life. So then this book in which
their names are said not to be written, it is set forth by the
end, and by the subject of it.</P>
<P>1. By the end, <HI>It is the Book of life:</HI> Not that it was a li∣ving
book, but because they that are written in that book, are
written unto life, that they may live to eternity to grace and
glory.</P>
<P>2. It is described by the subject, <HI>It is the Lambs Book of life;</HI>
either he is the possessor of it, God giving it to him that he
might take notice of all the names therein, and keep them safe
to salvation: or else he is the subject of it, as being the first and
principall person who is written in it; for he of old hath
been observed to be the head and cheif of the elect of God, in
<HI>Ephes. 1. 4. He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
world,</HI> therefore he chose him first, and us in him, as he is well
pleased, first with Christ, and in Christ with us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 17.
whether you speak of Gods everlasting complacency, or of the
manifestation of it in effectuall vocation, it is in Christ that he
is well pleased; first with Christ, and in his name with us, so
he is said to be fore-ordained <HI>before the foundation of the world,
1 Pet.</HI> 1. 20. So therefore it is said to be the book of the Lamb,
the Lambs booke of life, because that the book is given to him,
and because also that he is the principall person, that is first,
and primarily, and fundamentally written in this book. I
say it is first given to him, as if all the persons that God in∣tends
life unto, he did give them as it were in a scroul or book
to the Lord Jesus, (but of that I shall speak a little more by
and by.) In the mean time I speak now to the Analysis of the
Text; but if you shall not tras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e it, <HI>whose names are not writ∣ten
in the Lambs Book of life</HI> (but as it is here and indeed so it
holds in the Originall) <HI>the Book of life of the Lambe;</HI> Though
it be the like sence, then it may hold out a further notion
and meditation, and that is this.</P>
<P>1. That the Lambe is the subject of that life whereof it is
said, <HI>it is the Book of life of the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>2. He is the Author of it, <HI>to the elect people of God,</HI> in <HI>John</HI>
14. 19. that holds forth both that he is that life to us: Christ as
<PB N="131" REF="70"/>
God-man is the subject of this spirituall and eternall life; and
his man-hood, so receives it as a common vessell to all his
elect members, and because he lives, we shall live also, there∣fore
he is the Author both of giving and preserving this life to
his heavenly Kingdome.</P>
<P>Now by this Lambe, I need not tell you is meant Christ the
Lambe, <HI>without spot,</HI> John 1. 29. <HI>We are redeemed by the precious
bloud of Christ as of a Lambe without spot, 1 Pet.</HI> 1. 19. This
Lambe is here described by his suffering which was slain, was
put to death, a violent death: and that suffering of his is
amplified by the ancient vigour and efficacy of it, <HI>slain from the
beginning of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Now the note that first offers it selfe from this <HI>verse</HI> is
this.</P>
<P>That such whose names are written in the lambs book of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctr. 1.</NOTE>
they all and they onely are preserved from the worship of the
Beast: For here it is said, <HI>That all that dwell upon the Earth shall
worship him,</HI> saving they <HI>whose names are written in the Lambes
Book of life,</HI> they shall not worship him; but all whose names
are not written in the book of the life of the Lambe, they shall
worship the Beast: So then they whose names are written in
the Lambes book of life, they doe not worship him; (for if
their names be written there, they are expresly exempted;)
but they that doe worship him, they are said not to have their
names written in the Lambes book of life: So that such
whose names are written in the Lambes book of life, they and
all they, and they onely are preserved from the worship of the
Beast. It is a speech to the like purpose that you read in <HI>Rev.</HI>
17. 8. and upon the like occasion: <HI>The Beast that thou sawes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomelesse pit and go into
perdition, and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder (whose
names were not written in the Book of life from the foundation of the
world,</HI> &amp;c.) They admire and adore him, where he tells you
of an ancient act, hee doth not tell here when it was written,
there he doth, that ancient book wherein from the foundation
of the world they were written, and therefore before the
world such as were written in the Lambes book of life, were
lockt up to be preserved from the adoration of the Beast, and
<PB N="132" REF="71"/>
all the rest were left to worship the Beast.</P>
<P>For opening this point, here a Question or two may be mo∣ved
for explication of the termes of the Doctrine (which have
been a little expounded before.) First▪</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. Then it may be demanded, what is this Book of life?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> You read in Scripture of sundry books according
to which our eternall state stands or falls (if I may so call
them) that are said to be opened at the judgement day, whether
at the last judgement, or some representation of the last judge∣ment,
it is all one for the Doctrine: In <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 12. it is sayd,
<HI>When the Thrones were set, the Books were opened; and another book,
which is the Booke of life:</HI> So here is one book, according to
which, his Saints were judged, besides the booke of life, but
that also was opened. These bookes are truly observed by o∣thers,
to be first the book of Gods Providence, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. 16.
which is also called in <HI>Mal.</HI> 3. 16. the booke of Gods Remem∣brance,
wherein he takes notice of all persons and actions;
that is, keeps as exact account of them as if they were written
before him in a book, which day by day were fashioned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In
the providence of God there was a deliniation of all creatures
and actions that should come to passe. There is truly also the
booke of conscience; for also in that God registers all our
actions, according to which we shall be judged, the conscience
bearing witnesse about our persons and actions, so farre as
they are enlightned by God. And you read also of another
booke; <HI>The word that I have spoken, that shall judge them at the last
day,</HI> John 12. 48. he shall judge all the world by it, <HI>Rom. 2.
16. In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
according to my Gospel:</HI> These books will be opened; the booke
of Gods Providence, the booke of the Scripture, and the book
of conscience, by which we shall be judged.</P>
<P>But there is also the booke of Life, by which wee shall
be judged, in <HI>Rev.</HI> 10. 12. Now for the book of life that hath
a double exception in Scripture, for sometimes it is put for
the Church register, in which all are registred, as those that
were the living in <HI>Jerusalem. Isa. 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> It is said, <HI>Every one that
remaineth in Hierusalem shall be called holy, even every one that is
written among the living in Hierusalem:</HI> Or as the word is in the
<PB N="133" REF="71"/>
margent or bigger Bibles written, <HI>To life in Hierusalem;</HI> In the
Originall it is capable of both constructions, <HI>Every man capa∣ble
of life is written in Hierusalem:</HI></P>
<P>There is a book written of them that live there, of which it
is said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 87. 6. the Lord will recount when he writteth up
the people, that this or that man was born there: Of this book
also you read in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 13. 9. where the Lord doth threaten the
false Prophets, that his hand shall be upon them that see vani∣ty,
and devine lyes; they shall not be as members of my peo∣ple,
nor shall they be written in the writing of the house o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Israel;</HI> they shall neither have fellowship with Church nor
Common-wealth: There is a writing, therefore a Register,
a Record of them, which in the Old Testament were counted
Geneologies, and very carefully did they keep them; that if
they could not shew their pedigree from this Geneology, they
were as polluted. <HI>Ezra</HI> 2. 59. as also <HI>vers.</HI> 62. where he tells
you of sundry that came in among the people of <HI>Israel;</HI> but be∣cause
they could not find their names in the Register, they
were left aside till they could finde further proof of their pe∣digree;
they might be received as other Proselytes, but not as
native Israelites, who were counted of the Church from the
line of their Parents, and some of the sonnes of <HI>Barzilli,</HI> some
of the Priests, they thought it more honour to fetch their pe∣digree
from their father <HI>Barzilli,</HI> whom <HI>David</HI> had advanced
to sit at his Table; and they thought it more honour to be
counted of the house of <HI>Barzilli,</HI> then of the order of <HI>Aaron:</HI>
And they, when they would have presented themselves to the
Priests office, they were not received: why? because they
were not found in the Churches Register, and they had no di∣rection
from the Word to take Noble mens sons to be Priests,
but only of the sons of <HI>Aaron:</HI> So this is the book of Life, it
is called <HI>The writing of the living in Hierusalem;</HI> This is the
book of life, the Church-book, it is nothing but a counter∣pane
of the book of life, but not exactly agreeing to it; some∣times
we put in more then God doth, and sometimes lesse:
There be that belong to life whom we do not receive: Others
they do not present themselves, or we do not receive through
some failings in them or us; but if they belong to life, they
<PB N="134" REF="72"/>
are written in the Lambs book of life, they may not be writ∣ten
in the Church book; but this is not the book here spoken
of, the book of the life o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lamb: The Church is the body
of the Lamb, but they cannot discern who are his: <HI>The Lord
knows who are his,</HI> so do not we, nor the members of the
Church, therefore you heare here of a distinct booke of the
Lambs book of life, of which book it is expresly written,
<HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 15. That <HI>whosoever was not found written in the Lambs
book of life, was cast into the lake of fire.</HI></P>
<P>All men therefore that are written in the book of Life, or
in the book of the Lamb, they are written to life. Now this
we cannot say of the Church-book; for as hath been observed
of ancient time, there are many wolves within, and many
sheep without: Sometimes the Church hath cast out her
most precious members, both Officers and Members,
sad experience hath made it true in our times, therefore that is
not a certaine rule, that if a man be left out of the Church, he
is left everlastingly, unlesse there be such contempt of means
of grace, as in those whom the Lord hath branded for such
whom he takes no pleasure in to eternity: For it is said, <HI>who∣ever
was not found written in the Lambs book of life was cast into the
lake of fire;</HI> Therefore this is some other then that booke
of the Church: What book is that? no other but the eternall
record and register of Gods election, that is, the Lambs book,
whoever is not found, he is indeed cast out into the lake of
fire, being shut out from salvation by Christ, and then what
hope of salvation is there in himselfe?</P>
<P>Now of this book it is, of which <HI>Moses</HI> speaks, <HI>Exo. 32. 33. If
thou wilt not forgive the sin of thy people, then blot me out of the book
which thou hast written;</HI> not which the Church hath written,
but which thou hast written, which the Lord hath written of
life in Christ, in which the Lord hath written all the names
of his Elect: This is the book out of which hee desires to be
blotted out of; such was the extasie, I cannot say of his zeale,
but he was filled with such ardent zeale, that rather then such
a reproach should be cast upon God, that he was not able to
bring them to the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> let him be blotted out of
the book which he had written, let damnation it selfe fall up∣on
him, rather then the name of the Lord should be reproa∣ched
<PB N="135" REF="72"/>
by the uncircumcised Heathens; and in that sence <HI>Paul</HI>
wisheth himselfe separate from Christ, <HI>for his brethren, his kins∣men
according to the flesh,</HI> Rom. 9. 3. He doth not say, he would
be cast out of the Church; but he found, that zeale for the
whole Church, and for the Lord Jesus, that rather then the
Gospel of Christ should be hindered, if it may stand with Gods
liking, he could rather wish such a wretch as he should be cut
off, then that the whole body of his people should be cast off:
This is the Lambs book of Life, called the book of Life, not
because the Lord stands in need of a book, but because those
whom in his eternall purpose he hath decreed to save, his un∣changeable
purpose doth fixe them as fast in his remembrance,
as if they were written in a book before him: For that end his
decree hath taken such particular notice of them, that if they
were written in a book before him, they could not be more
stedfastly and particularly recorded.</P>
<P>It is a phrase borrowed from men, that when they would
remember such a man, or such a freind, they set them down in
a booke; God stands not in need of books, but his clear, and
everlasting love to them is such, that they are engraven as on
the palmes of his hands, as the Shew-bread was present before
the Lord continually, which represented the 12. Tribes, that
his eye might be upon them from one end of the week to ano∣ther,
and the word which the <HI>Septuagints</HI> use for Shew-bread, it
is translated as the word which the Apostle useth, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 28.
and the Greeke Translators and Hebrew expresse it, it is the
bread of Gods purpose, or of Gods face, and what is his pur∣pose?
it is not with him as it is with us, that whiles we speak
of one man, we forget another; but his purpose is alwayes
the same; and these being the bread of Gods purpose, they are
ever before him from one end of the week to another, and
from one end of the year to another, now that is the meaning
of the Question, <HI>what is the Booke of life?</HI> It is the booke of
Gods eternall election, that is, it is the register or record of
the names of all whom God hath chosen to life and salvation
in Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. If you shall aske why it is called the Lambes Booke of
life?</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="73"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> First, because the Lord hath given this booke to
Christ, and all the names of his elect by name to be brought to
salvation, and kept in a state of salvation to imortality, and
therefore you shall read in Scripture, when God puts forth an
eternall love to his people, wrought eternall salvation for us,
I mean when he did eternally elect us to grace and glory in
this eternall election of his, there was accompanying an eter∣nall
donation in giving them to Christ, Christ knew his fa∣thers
counsel from eternity, and the Lord gave them to Christ
by him to be brought, and he undertaking that they shall be
brought to salvation, the Lord requiring that he should keep
them to immortality; he shall work the means and apply the
same effectually to the end of the world: This is evident
from those Scriptures that speak of the grant, and of the gift of
them to Christ before their effectuall calling, though donati∣on
go before that; for from that love of God by which he
gives us to Christ in our effectuall calling, he gives us Christ,
and faith to receive Christ; but before this, there is a giving, a
donation of us to Christ, as <HI>John 6. 37. All that the Father gi∣veth
me, shall come unto me;</HI> So this coming to Christ is belie∣ving
on Christ, and it is so exprest in <HI>ver. 35. He that cometh to
me shall never hunger, and he that beliveth on me shall never thirst:</HI>
To come to Christ, is to belive on his name; thus much doth
hee expresse himselfe; that all that the Father give him in
his eternall counsell, they shall come unto him, to wit, in
effectuall calling him: the Father will draw none but whom
in his eternall counsell he hath given to Christ; <HI>and whom he
drawes, I will not cast out,</HI> in <HI>ver.</HI> 37. to 44. So then when this
act of Gods eternall election passed on those whose persons are
designed to grace and glory, hee gave all by name to the
Lord Jesus, as if they were particularly registred in a booke:
And he promised, that in fulnesse of time, he would draw
them to him, and required that the Lord Jesus should keep
them under his wing to imortality; it is called therefore
the Lambs booke of life, because he is the subject receptive of
it.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. And again, it is called the Lambs booke of life,
because he is the head of all Gods elect; they are all elect in
<PB N="137" REF="73"/>
him, not besides or out of him, not as actually believing in
him, for it is long before any work of ours, <HI>Rom. 9. 11. Not of
workes, but of him that calleth, the children being not yet born, nei∣ther
having done good or evill, that the purpose of God according to e∣lection
might stand.</HI> Election i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before any worke of ours, God
gives us in his eternall councell to Christ, but we are not then
in him by faith; faith is an effect of our election, not the
cause of it: <HI>As many as were ordained to eternall life believed,</HI>
Acts 13. 46. 48. But this is the thing; It is a true distinction
that some give in that case; we are in Christ, not by actuall
existence in beleiving; nor as so considered, but by virtuall
comprehension: the Lord looks at us as in him, we are not
in him by faith; but the Lord comprehending us in his ever∣lasting
decree, we are in him by Gods charter, even children
not born, the Lord hath wrapped us in his everlasting armes,
in his electing love, promising in time to give us faith to be∣leive
on him, and therefore to come to him, and to give him
to us that wee may live in his sight; therefore it is the Lambs
book of life, as he is the sonne of man, the sonne of the Virgin
<HI>Mary,</HI> to be united to the second person in Trinity, long be∣fore
his humane nature was in being.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 3. And it is called also the book of the life of the
Lambe; if you have respect of referring to Christ this life, then
you take Christ as he is the subject of this life, in <HI>John 14. 19.
Because I live, you shall live also;</HI> I live, and then you live: and
he is the author, the efficient, the procreant, and conservant
cause of life in us to eternity; the Lord hath given us eter∣nall
life, and this life is in his son; <HI>He that hath the sonne hath
life, 1 John</HI> 5. 12. So you see the meaning of these words,
these persons that are thus given to Christ, elect vessels to
grace and glory that are given to Christ, they are preserved
from the worship of the Beast, and none but they, they onely;
for this purpose you read that false Christs (whereof Anti∣christ
is chief) <HI>Mat. 24. 24. They shall deceive many, yea if it were
possible the very elect:</HI> It implies thus much, that none of them
shall be deceived by all false Christs, but all others shall be de∣ceived;
earthly minded men, and such whose names are not
written in the Lambes book of life, they shall be deceived, <HI>the
<PB N="138" REF="74"/>
Beast shall go into perdition, and they with him,</HI> Rev. 17. 8. Not but
that for a time they that are Gods elect may be taken with a
fond admiration and adoration of the Beast, to beleive as the
Church of <HI>Rome</HI> believes, and may look for peace of consci∣ence
from the dispensations of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> it may
be so as <HI>Bilney</HI> and <HI>Latimer,</HI> that were marvellous devout to
that Church; though it pleased God that <HI>Bilney,</HI> you may
read it in his Epistle to Bishop <HI>Tonstall,</HI> that being troubled in
conscience, he had taken all the courses that their Religion
enjoyned him; had made confession to the Preists, and they
enjoyned him pennance and whipping of himselfe, but for all
these his wound bled as fresh as before; till in the end he took
an English Testament, as it was translated by <HI>Erasmus,</HI> not with
any intent to finde any thing in it that might ease his trouble,
but because he was a perfect Latinist; but reading that place
in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 15. these words did so affect him, that immediate∣ly
the Lord letting him see his love in Christ Jesus: The Lord
(saith he) let me see that I had taken a wrong course all this
while; I have sought for salvation where it was not to be had,
and prayed those to whom he spoke, not to take it ill, for it
was not out of any neglect of them, but out of his faithfulness,
having had experience, that the course they prescribed, that
was not the way; but it so farre prevailed, as that he was
marvellously esteemed; but he was taken up by <HI>Latimer,</HI> he
made <HI>Bilney</HI> hear him Preach a most fearfull Sermon against
<HI>Lutherans,</HI> that were then better then he; yet <HI>Bilney</HI> saw that
he had zeal, but not according to knowledge, and he knew
not how to come within him; but he went to him in private,
and desired to speak with him, and he must not say him nay;
then he up and tells him what a miserable wretch he had been,
how he had wounded his conscience; how he had confest his
sin to this and that Preist; how unprofitable all those meanes
were to him which they prescribed; and there was no means
in the world to finde peace till the Lord applyed that everla∣sting
redemption in the bloud of Christ; why saith <HI>Latimer,</HI>
he comes to seek for pardon from me to his soul; and saith
he, I saw I stood in more need of being taught by him, and
therefore stiles him in his Sermon Saint <HI>Bilney,</HI> that caught his
<PB N="139" REF="74"/>
soul, and revealed that to him which he never heard of. There∣fore
it is possible that <HI>Latimer</HI> and <HI>Bilney</HI> may be devout Ca∣tholicks
for a time; but now when this electing love of God
puts forth it selfe in the fruits of it, which is effectual calling;
now they are fully satisfied that all this devotion, beleiving
as the Church beleives, they see they are so farre out of the
way, as faith is contrary to sence and reason: So that those
whom God reserved and chosen to life, they are preserved
from totall and finall adoration of the Beast, they may for a
time through ignorance worship the Beast, as the best of Gods
servants in those times did, and many times have been most
zealous for the Catholick cause; and yet when the Lord hath
called them effectually to his grace, then, not one that are
written in the Lambs book of life doe worship him; so that
though they worship him before, yet now they do not, when
they come to see their folly, and have the love of God made
known to them.</P>
<P>The Reason is first taken from the experimentall knowledg
of every child of God effectually called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> from the evident ex∣perience
that he hath of the vanity of the Roman Catholick
Church, and of the emptinesse of calling on any to look from
Church power, to heale or wound the conscience, as of them∣selves,
further then they dispence the Ordinances of Christ:
and then it is not they, but Christ in them, and for them to
look for salvation in the communion of that Church, and in
reconcilement to that Church; They are so experimentally
beaten off from that, and possest of the contrary by their own
experience, that you need not take them from adoring the
Beast; for they see it is a Beast, and they shall as wel utterly de∣stroy
their souls, as worship the Beast; and therfore the love of
Christ constrains <HI>Bilney,</HI> and he draws <HI>Latimer,</HI> and <HI>Latimer</HI>
draws others, till they have propogated the truth of God to
all ages. But that, though it be one reason, yet it is the least.</P>
<P>Let me shew another reason why the elect of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> after the
electing love of God comes to be dispenced to them in out∣ward
execution: For, before it may come to passe, they may
worship the Beast, but then they will not doe it finally: but
when the electing love of God is shed abroad in their hearts,
<PB N="140" REF="75"/>
then they will not do it; and the reason of that (you cannot
give a demonstrative reason but from this) to prevent impos∣sibility,
it is not possible that they should: now there are three
fundamentall reasons of the impossibility of it; two proper∣ties
there are in Gods electing love: There is in Gods election,
first, immutability, as God himselfe is unchangeable, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.
6. so are his decrees unchangeable, the foundation of God
stands sure, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 19. and what he hath purposed, he will
bring to passe: <HI>The counsell of the Lord is true for ever,</HI> in <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.
10, 11. he disappoints all the decrees of men, but his own
counsels they take place for ever in every age, therefore it is
not possible that any of his should perish; and perish they
should, if they should worship the Beast; but it is not possible,
his unchangeable decree keepes them.</P>
<P>Again, there is another property in his electing love, which
is the efficacy of it, for Gods electing love doth choose us out
of the world, <HI>John</HI> 15. 19. And if he choose us out of the world,
the efficacy of that is, that it delivers us from the evill world:
God electing us out of the world, hath redeemed and delive∣red
us from this present evill world, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 4. Now if the e∣lecting
love of God be of such efficacy, that when he elects
men of his grace, he will in fulnesse of time deliver them from
the world, then they shall not run headlong to the worship of
the Beast, whom their hearts cannot close withall; the Lord
redeemes them from that vaine conversation received by tra∣dition
from their Fathers, I, though there be such efficacy in
the bloud of Ancestors, yet the electing love of God redeemes
them from that: But that will more appear in the second
Reason.</P>
<P>And that is the faithfulnesse of Christ, and the efficacy of
of his redeeming bloud. <HI>All that the Father hath given me shall
come unto me, and those that doe come unto mee, I will by no means
cast out,</HI> John 6. 37. <HI>Of those that thou hast given me, I have lost
none,</HI> but the sonne of perdition, that (but) is not an excep∣tive,
but an adversative; he that was never given, was lost, he
did not bring him on to salvation; <HI>For this is the will of the Fa∣ther
that sent me, that of all that he hath given me, I should loose
nothing,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>John</HI> 6. 37, 38, 39. That is, his faithfulnesse, and
<PB N="141" REF="75"/>
with his faithfulnesse there is such efficacy in his bloud, that
though the bloud of Ancestors run very warme, that a man
would choose to live no better life, nor keep a better house
then his Father or Grandfather, but wish their souls might be
but as safe as theirs, when men are once redeemed by the bloud
of Christ, and that is sprinkled upon their consciences, then
the bloud of Christ is warmer then the bloud of Ancestors:
though the Religion of our Fathers should be strong in the
hearts of devout Catholicks, as in <HI>Bilney</HI> or <HI>Latimer,</HI> then a∣lasse
for our poor Fathers, what is become of them? they pity
them, and see plainly, that unlesse the Lord led them a further
way then the Religion of those that taught them, they are
gone everlastingly, and then they wonder that God should e∣ver
choose such a dunghill, thee and me, that they see a broad
difference between the Religion of their Ancestors, and that
which they see now; but that is the efficacy of the bloud of
Christ, there is that efficacy in it, that it washeth away all re∣lations
to Fathers, to antiquity, and universality, he is cru∣cified
to them all; <HI>God forbid</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>that I should
glory save in the crosse of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is
crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</HI> Gal. 6. 14. So that though
all the world runne after the Beast, they will not; the world
looks at them as base unworthy creatures, and so they look
at the world.</P>
<P>And there is a third fundamentall Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> and that is ta∣ken
from the power and presence of the Spirit of Gods grace,
in the hearts of his people. <HI>We are kept by the power of God,
through faith unto salvation,</HI> 1 Pet. 1. 5. That is, by the spirit of
God, and by the power of that spirit, he keeps our faith, and
by faith keeps us in the way of his ordinances, and in the way
of sanctification to salvation: <HI>Little children, yee are of God,
and you have overcome these Antichrists;</HI> why? <HI>for greater is he
that is in you, then he that is in the world, 1 John</HI> 4. 4. The power
of God is in you, they are of the world, and the world is car∣ryed
away with them; you are of God, and you hear them
not; <HI>for greater is he tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is in you, then he that is in the world.</HI>
These are three fundamentall Reasons which are indeed the
demonstrative cause of the impossibility of them to be finally
<PB N="142" REF="76"/>
carried to the worship of the Beast, the election of God will
not suffer it, the unchangeblenesse thereof, the faithfulnesse of
Christ, the efficacy of the blood of Christ, and the power of the
spirit, and that which flowes from it is the experience of Gods
love, and the vertue of their faith in Christ: Their faith is
unchangeble, not possible to be rooted out, in <HI>Luke 22. 31, 32.
I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not:</HI> It may be shaken,
but it shall not finally fail; <HI>I will put my fear in their hearts that
they shall not depart from me,</HI> Jer. 32. 40. and that is the proper
act of faith: <HI>Be not high minded, but fear;</HI> his mercy is suffici∣ent
for us, trust steadfastly on the grace of Christ; and though
<HI>Peter</HI> seemed not to trust on the grace of Christ, yet in his worst
state he knew that all the courses of Satan were vanity, and he
durst not but in his heart believe that Christ was the <HI>Messiah:</HI>
so all the elect of God know the Beast is a Beast, and the Ca∣tholick
Roman Church is a Beast, and the head of that Beast is
a beastly head, and they know that their Doctrine is sensuall,
and carnall, and that they all shall go into perdition; and
withall, their experience doth evidently convince them, that
were it not in a pang of temptation in which they are not able
to abide by it, yet by a renewall of the blood of the Lord Je∣sus
sprinkled on their souls, they are brought a fresh to see the
work of Gods grace stirred up in them; but otherwise their
constant course is, as in <HI>Rev.</HI> 14. you hear them coming as on
a stage, representing the Lambe in their carriage and conver∣sation,
<HI>and follow the Lambe wheresoever he goes:</HI> but for the
Beast, a stranger, they will not follow; but both their faith
and experience yeild them a third cause, and that is, the spirit
of God carying them an end: <HI>My sheep hear my voyce, and they
follow me;</HI> but they know not the voyce of strangers, they see
a difference between good and evill; and therefore if they
hear a man speak, and doth not speak of salvation by him,
but of the world, or of himselfe, they will not follow him,
<HI>John</HI> 10. 45. Thus you see the Reason why none of them
worship the Beast: But on the other side, all the rest of the
world doe, meaning where Antichrists power comes, speaking
of those times when there was great power given to him, to
speak great things, and no man might say, Sir, why do you
<PB N="143" REF="76"/>
so: in that time when he had power to be active forty &amp; two
months, when he had power to make Warre with the Saints,
and to overcome them, and when all Nations worshipped
him, and did not shake off that Religion; but in former
times, before reformation of Religion, this was an universal
practice; they all, Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues gave their
power to the Beast; and the reason of that was, from Gods just
judgement, for their not receiving the truth in love, <HI>therefore
he gave them over to strong delusions to believe lyes.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, from the efficacy of Satan in the power of deceit∣full
sophistry, and doing wonders.</P>
<P>And thirdly, by the plausiblenesse, trumpery, and bravery
of that Religion, so suitable to carnal reason, that they were
carried away thereto, and it could not be, but they should be
carried away by the man of Sinne.</P>
<P>The use first may then be thus much;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> If all that dwell on
Earth, whose names are not written in the book of life, do
worship the Beast, and none are excluded but those whose
names are written in the Lambs booke of life, then this will
unavoidably follow, that a Papist by his Religion cannot
go beyond a Reprobate; what he may, and renounce his Re∣ligion,
is another matter, as <HI>Bilney</HI> and <HI>Latimer</HI> sometimes
did; they were written in the Lambes booke of life: but by
his Religion, take them that do believe, as the Catholick
Roman Church believes, and believe no more, but practice
that which that Religion directs them to, and goe no further,
and they continue and live and die in that, then I must pro∣nounce
it from the Text, they cannot go beyond a Reprobate,
the reason is evident from the Text; for if none of them
whose names are written in the Lambs booke of life doe wor∣ship
the Beast, and onely they do worship the Beast, whose
names are not written in the Lambs booke of life, then if they
be not written in the Lambs booke of life, the Text is very
strong &amp; clear in <HI>Rev. 20. 15. Whosoever was not found written in
the Lambs Book of life, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone:</HI>
But those that worship the Beast, are not <HI>written in the Lambs,
booke of life,</HI> that is in the Text: Here are two propositions
<PB N="144" REF="77"/>
very evident; <HI>All that are written in the Lambs booke of life doe
not worship the Beast:</HI> But those that worship the Beast, <HI>are not
written in the Lambs baok of life.</HI> Then the conclusion is, <HI>They
shall be cost into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone:</HI> That
if it appear that this Beast is the Roman Catholick Church,
and the head of this Beast is the Pope: The conclusion will be
most evident, that no man living and dying a Papist, can go
beyond a Reprobate: I dare not say, but some that are igno∣rant,
whom devotion hath carryed to that Religion; it is
possible some of them when they come to death, may see the
vanity of that Religion of worshipping Saints, and of confi∣ning
their Faith to them, but that is not by their Religion:
but if they dye in that Religion, and if their faith and wor∣ship
be thrust upon them from the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Church,
and they worship Saints and Angels, and believe in their
owne merits for their justification, I do pronounce to you,
that a Papist, living and dying a Papist, cannot go beyond a
Reprobate; I meane such an one <HI>was not written in the Lambs
booke of life:</HI> And they that are not, <HI>are cast into the lake that
burns with fire and brimstone,</HI> that is the issue: And therefore
what a fearfull thing is it in such that do all they can to re∣concile
Nations to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and are mad upon
Romish religion? what desperate service do they undertake,
to bring men to such a religion as destroys many millions of
soules? It is true, <HI>Those that are written in the Lambs booke of
life;</HI> God looseth none of his sheep: but it is evident they are
bloody Butchers of many Christians not chosen, yet devout
Christians, many an one under pang of Conscience, with
sence of many sinfull passions and lusts, are not able to get
out but by a Priests absolution; and if they be covered with a
Fryars coule, they hope they shall do well enough: Such a
conscience as can be opened and healed by such wooden keys
as these, if they know no more, such cannot be saved.</P>
<P>I will not enlarge it, but it were necessary to be pressed
and urged in some places, look not at it as a matter of curi∣osity
and circumstance what Religion a man dyes in, and
think as some States-men doe, that if it were not for hot-spur'd
Jesuites on the one side, and hot-spur'd Puritans (as
<PB N="145" REF="77"/>
they call them) on the other side, Protestants and Papists
might be easily reconciled. These are the whisperings of flesh
and blood; but that which is written in the word, doth bear
expresse testimonie against such a conclusion: For if Jesuites
were removed, and Puritans too, yet if there were any left
that thought they could worship the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as they
require, that you must believe as they believe, your faith is
built upon the Church, and upon the dispensation of the
keyes of that Church, such a faith and obedience as fals short
of Christ Jesus, that all salvation is to be expected from him,
if both Jesuites, and those they call Puritans were removed,
if there were none, but that take up their faith and obedi∣ence
in that worship they hold forth: I say there is not any
one of them that so live, and so dye, knowing what they be∣lieve,
that can be saved. Indeed you read in <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. many
know not the depth of Satan, and it is another matter what
God may dispence to them in private; but men that know
what they do, and believe according to the doctrine of that
Church, and worship according to the direction of it: I say,
men living, and so dying, there is not one of them whose
names are written in the Lambs book of life, and <HI>therefore
shall be cast into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone.</HI></P>
<P>This may teach us a true ground of any mans preserva∣tion
from the pollutions of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> bewitching polluti∣ons;
sometimes a Catholick Strumpet carries all the world
after her, as in those times: Sometimes the world swallows
up the Church, and every man thinkes him happy, if hee
may be clad with thick clay; others are taken up with provi∣sions
for their belly, and sensuall Epicurean lusts, there be a
world of such people: Now what doth preserve the people
of God, that they are not carryed away either with the Ca∣tholick
religion, or with worldly ambition, they are not
taken with these: but see the vanity of them; what, are any
of us better then those that have been bewitched by these? but
what puts the difference? The originall difference is, God
hath written them in the Lambs book of life, and <HI>what hee
hath written, he hath written,</HI> as <HI>Pilate</HI> sayd: Hee hath written
such to life, and his decree is irrecoverable: <HI>My counsell shall
<PB N="146" REF="78"/>
stand, and I will do all my pleasure,</HI> Isa. 46. 9, 10. Therefore there
is the Originall, from thence it flows, the Lord Jesus Christ
concurring with the Fathers counsell, he hath given us re∣demption
from the blood of Ancestors, and redeemed us from
the present evill world, and will seek up every stragling
Lamb, and presents us spotlesse to his heavenly Father, and
then the spirit of God, by which he works all in the hearts
of his people that receives us, for Christ and the spirit; for
Christ comes and takes possession of us, and so thereby girds
up our loyns to a dependance on him, and his grace, that we
are preserved and saved from those fearfull temptations that
overcome others, and all the world are over-whelmed
withall.</P>
<P>It may teach us the marvellous freedome of the love of
God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> and therefore to admire the wonderfull love of God,
the cause of all this our preservation from such prevailing e∣vills
as swallow up the whole world; how doth it appear?
why, I pray you consider, when the Lord wrote down thy
name, or mine, or any mans name, who stood by at his elbow
(if I may so speak) to put him in mind of my name or thine?
he thought of us, if our names be there, and he set us downe,
and he delivered us to Christ Jesus by name; what ever thy
name is, he took notice of thy name; such a man in such a
place, he will live in this or that Countrey, he is one, take
notice of him, lay down a price for him; in fulnesse of time
send a spirit into this heart; if he live in a Popish Countrey,
save him from Popery; If in a worldly Countrey, save him
from the world: where ever he lives, save him from himself,
and bring him to my heavenly Kingdom; but what was
there in us that could commend us to God? or what could
there in us but what he appointed, but what he should put
into us; he could not fore-see any thing, but that hee must
work it, therefore it must certainly be his undeserved love
that must take notice of them, and give them so to come to
Christ, <HI>and all that the Father hath given him shall come unto him.</HI>
The Lord will draw them, and then they shall come; in the
meane time he keeps them from his Fathers eternal donation,
in <HI>John 17. 17. Those whom thou hast given me, I have kept.</HI> Hee
<PB N="147" REF="78"/>
hath not lost any, but one that was not given him to keep, he
prays to God to keepe them through his own name, he
keeps them by his own spirit, and this was agreed on from
the foundation of the world, when this book was written;
and it was not written yesterday, but before the foundation
of the world, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 8. His thoughts were about thee and
me; and whoever is written therein, a matter of much praise
and glory to God, that he should have such marvellous pre∣cious
thoughts to us. <HI>Psalm. 139. 17. How precious are thy
thoughts to me O God.</HI> And so in <HI>Psal.</HI> 40. 5. we read of the
precious thoughts of God towards us; that hee should have
such thoughts, when time yet was not, neither we nor our fa∣thers;
and all he did fore-see in thee and me, would but pro∣voke
his wrath; what was good he must work, and that was
from his counsell: If you see any vanish away, or fall away
from his grace, and from his Saints, and he hath no pleasure
in them, they are not given to Christ, you see he is the giver
of them; but if men be not given to Christ, they will fall a∣way:
<HI>All that the Father gives me shall come unto me, it is my Fa∣thers
will I should not loose one of them.</HI> If men will not hearken
to the Bishop of their souls, the Lord Jesus Christ, see the des∣perate
danger thereof, and the originall root, <HI>They are not
written in the Lambs book of life.</HI></P>
<P>It may be of singular comfort to all the elect of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE>
whose names are written in the book of Life: It is a great
comfort that a man is written to life, hee might have beene
written to death, had not the Lord been pleased so to doe:
You read in the Epistle of <HI>Jude,</HI> vers. 4. <HI>Of certain men crept
in unawares, who were of old ordained to condemnation:</HI> The word
in the Originall is, <HI>fore-written, written afore-time to destructi∣on:</HI>
Now I say, that a man is not written to destruction, but
to life, and to life in Christ; not as <HI>Adam,</HI> that was to stand
by his own strength, and so long as he useth grace well, he
shall live; but if not, he shall dye: and he so used it, that if
God give him not life in Christ, he dyed for ever: This is in
<HI>Adams</HI> covenant, not in Christs, that was for a man to live by
his own righteousnesse: <HI>Do this and thou shalt live,</HI> Levit. 18. 5.
How wofull was our condition in this case, but to be writ∣ten
<PB N="148" REF="79"/>
to life, and to life in Christ; that is, <HI>Because hee lives, we
shall live also: I am the way, the truth, and the life:</HI> And by this
being written in the Lambs book of life, that the Lord should
think upon us, when we had no thoughts of him; nay had
no being, that he should then undertake for us; that when
the Father gives us, he will receive us; and by receiving us,
keep us spotlesse to his heavenly Kingdome, that he wil pre∣serve
us from possibility of damnable Errors: <HI>They shall seduce
if it were possible, the very Elect,</HI> Mat. 24. 24. But there is no pos∣sibility;
what a marvellous matter is it, that it is not possi∣ble
that any of those that are given to Christ should be sedu∣ced;
it is such a mercy that may swallow up all discourage∣ments,
all afflictions, all blasphemy of a mans good name
and state, and wealth, and health, and all whatsoever;
this may support him, that it is not possible he should be se∣duced:
For <HI>the Lord knows who are his,</HI> the foundation of
God stands sure; the Lord hath written it, and he is more
constant then <HI>Pilate,</HI> or the Kings of <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Medes:</HI> The
Law is written and established by the Kings Ring, and God
is more stedfast then any of the Kings of the Earth, what he
hath written shall be accomplished; the Lord will draw them
to Christ, and Christ will keep them, not one of them shall
perish, not one of them shall worship the Beast; or if they
do, they soone see their folly, and are recovered out of all
snares, they shall not prevaile against them.</P>
<P>It may be of instruction and exhortation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 5.</NOTE> to provoke
you to make your election sure, then you make your sal∣vation
sure, and preservation from Popery and the world,
and from the Devill, and from your own corrupt Nature,
sure that you shall not be carried captive with the polutions
of the times and places you live in, though hundreds run from
God one way, and ten thousands another way, &amp; fall off hi∣ther
and thither, yet you shall still be preserved: in <HI>John</HI> 6.
68. where our Saviour asked his Disciples, <HI>will ye also go away?</HI>
when many of those that were his Disciples went away and
fell off from him, being offended from something which he
had spoken to them, and that was that Doctrine that we have
now in hand, and some other corolaries from it, they walked
<PB N="149" REF="79"/>
no more with him; then saith Christ to the rest, <HI>will yee also
go away? Peter</HI> answered in the behalfe of the rest; <Q>Lord, to
whom shall we go, thou hast the words of eternall life:</Q> As
who should say, whether shall a man go to mend himself?
<HI>Thou hast the words of eternall life?</HI> and having the words of
eternall life, how shall they do better else where? so it be∣hooves
us then as we desire, to be preserved from all apostacy
and backsliding from God, notwithstanding all the temptati∣ons
of the flattering world, or busie world, or from the de∣stroying
world, by persecution, and flattering by prosperity,
and busie world, by the cares of the world, and continuall
cumber about the world, and distempers in our hearts on that
ground, in such a case as this what shall preserve us? If our
names be written in the Lambes book of life, truely we shall
be preserved, that neither the world, nor our passions and
lusts shall prevail against us. <HI>My father</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>is grea∣ter
then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand:
and I and my Father are oue, my Father and I will keepe them,</HI> Joh.
10. 27, 28.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> You will say, it is a needlesse exhortation to make
our election sure, if that be not done long ago; for it is not
begun in this world, but long before; it is concluded long be∣fore,
or else we are not written in the Lambes book of life;
one of these two is concluded in Heaven: Christ knows those
that are given to him by his Father, before he knows them by
name, <HI>John</HI> 10. 14. It is worthy of memory that Christ
knows them all by name, that argues the particularity and
singularity of them, as he knows all the Stars in Heaven, so
doth he much more know all his elect; if he know them all
by name, hee then particularly observes them, and pre∣vents
us with blessings of goodnesse, and preserves us from pre∣vailing
evills, but if it be recorded of God, is it not in vain to
exhort to make it sure.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If it were in vain, methinks the Apostle should not
have used it, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 10. Then that is it that lyes upon all
Christians; some think it is not possible, but then it were a
vain exhortation, <HI>Make your calling and election sure;</HI> if you
do, a wide and open door of entrance shall be minished unto
<PB N="150" REF="80"/>
you; well then though I cannot make sure my election in it
selfe, for it is sure in it selfe; but the Question is, whether it
it is sure to me, that is my duty, for he knowes who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,
and knows them by name, and keeps them in his name, and
hath given his Angels charge over us, and they will all watch
over us, and therefore our Saviour in <HI>Luke</HI> 10. 20. saith to
his Disciples, <HI>Rejoyce not in this that the Devils are subject unto
you, but that your names are written in Heaven.</HI> Our election is
sure enough in heaven, no stormes will alter it there: But
now (in a word) can we make our election sure? the Apostle
intimates when you make your calling sure, you make your
election sure: your calling, that is but the actuall execution
of this eternall election; but they are so neere, that many
the Lord puts them one for another, he tells his Disciples,
<HI>you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,</HI> John 15. 16. he
means of his selection, his calling them out of the world, then
he doth communicate his electing love to such; it is wrought
for us before in Christs death, in Gods councell, and in his
effectuall redemption, wrought for us on the Crosse: but
yet it is not manifest to our consciences till calling, but make
your calling sure, and then election is sure: <HI>When you are
called according to his purpose,</HI> Rom. 8. 28. that is this book of
life, that is his purpose, that we are in Gods purpose written
to life, look to that he hath saved us, and called us, <HI>Not accor∣ding
to our workes, but according to his own purpose and grace which
was given us in Christ Jesus, 2 Tim.</HI> 1. 8. that is the book of life
and grace; of free grace, purposing us to life; and you read
in <HI>Rom. 8. 30. Whom he predestinated, them he hath called; and
whom he called, them he justified:</HI> now if a man be effectually
called to grace that doth search election, let me briefly touch
it, that which makes sure calling.</P>
<P>1. In our effectuall calling, there is a declaration of Gods
love to the soul in Christ Jesus by the spirit of grace, in the
doctrine of the Gospell, for that is Gods call; in our calling,
God calls for his part by his grace and spirit, and we answere
that spirit, by that faith, which by the call of God is wrought
in our hearts; I say, God calls effectually to his grace by
manifesting the rich grace of God in Christ, electing freely,
<PB N="151" REF="80"/>
calling freely, from the obedience of sinne and Satan, to the
liberty of the sons of God, as to those in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> time,
when they wandered up &amp; down like Lambs in a large place:
<HI>Bilney</HI> he fetches in that one word in his lost and forlorn con∣dition;
He read this promise, and the spirit of God applies
it; <HI>Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
chiefe:</HI> This being applyed by the spirit, it falls on him with
power, and he sees the goodnesse of God in Christ, and the
vanity of all things else: and seeing so much glory in Christ,
and in particular to him also, this lets him see the vanity of
all other courses; for this manifestation of Gods spirit doth
effectually and manifestly open our eyes to see, and hearts to
believe what the Lord offers, for faith is said to receive what
the Lord gives of grace; here is then that which makes call∣ing
sure, for otherwise how can we know it, but by the ma∣nifestation,
and declaration, and revelation of the Spirit:
The things that eye never saw, nor eare heard, nor e∣ver
entred into the heart of man, but he hath revealed them
by his spirit, 1 <HI>Cor. 2. 9, 10. As no man knows the things of
man, but the spirit of man, so no man knows the things of God, but the
spirit of God: And we have not received the spirit of this world, but
the spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are free∣ly
given us of God.</HI> The spirit of God it is that searcheth all
things, <HI>even the deep things of God,</HI> and reveals them to us, and
lets us see the treasures of grace, and lets us see them thus ap∣plyed,
this is the ground of effectuall calling, God calling
by his spirit, and we answering that call, and from both
these springs another fruit of our effectuall calling, which
is likewise a certaine pledge of it that being thus called: <HI>Bles∣sed
be God</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>that hath called us to the fellowship
of his sonne</HI> actually and effectually.</P>
<P>2. Thence it comes to passe, that wee choose the Lord for
our God: <HI>We have none in heaven but him, nor none on earth that
we desire in comparison of him:</HI> Away then with those beautifull
Strumpets, and all works of iniquity, and wayes of dark∣nesse,
wayes of ambition, these are all blasted; now <HI>I desire
to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified,</HI> 1 Cor. 2. 2.
and now it is, <HI>that he rejoyceth in nothing, save in the Crosse of
<PB N="152" REF="81"/>
our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> Gal. 6. 14. Now this electing love in
that we elect God, we could never choose God, had not he cho∣sen
us, and in some measure discovered what his electing love
was to us, this brings the heart back again to choose him, and
none but him: now that is another security of our election,
and therein it differs from all others; a man may have a kinde
of sanctification by common gifts, which will leave him still
to work for himselfe, but this is to abuse the very gifts of
God, which the spirit hath wrought in us, though they be not
such as accompany salvation, still we are not lift up above
our selves, but when we are called effectually to Christ;
now no motion swayes us, but as we see the will of God in it,
we cannot beleive as the Church beleives: but we beleive
our brethren and the Church, as we see the Church follows
the foot-steps of the will of God; <HI>If I now please men</HI> (saith
the Apostle) <HI>I am not the servant of Christ, 1 Thes.</HI> 2. 4. Nor of
men sought we glory, when we might have been burden some,
as the Apostles of Christ: If a man be left to fast for himselfe,
or pray for himselfe, or worke for himselfe, and all is for
himselfe, that he work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from a principal respect unto him∣selfe,
truly this will darken a mans effectuall calling; and if
it be his constant course, doubtlesse his heart is not right with
God: It is true, in a pang of temptation a man may be
wheeled about, as <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> yet the sight of Gods e∣lecting
love quickens them to see their sinne, how farre they
are turned aside from God; but there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soul is bent, as it
were, with the point of a compass touched with a Load-stone,
it may be jogged by windes and stormes, yet it lookes still to
the North pole; though you may shake it from its course,
yet let it but stand a while, it will directly look to the North
pole, there it will stand; so it is with all the children of
God, they cannot but worke; for Christ in <HI>John 16. 14. He
shall glorifie me, for he shall receive of mine, and give it unto you:</HI>
So that the heart that is sincere, it workes from Christ, and
for Christ, and with Christ; <HI>I laboured more abundantly then
they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me, 1 Cor.</HI>
15. 10. So that you see what the manner of Gods people in
this case is, they are from Christ, and for Christ, and with
<PB N="153" REF="81"/>
Christ, and it is a seal of Gods election; the highest seal is,
<HI>God knowes who are his,</HI> and that seal he manifests by his spirit
in the Gospel, it is the spirit that seals up our adoption, and
here is another seal we set to our seal, while we cleave to him
with all our heart and soul, and seek after him, <HI>and have none
in heaven but him, nor on Earth that we desire in comparison of
him.</HI></P>
<P>And thirdly, the last assurance of a mans election and cal∣ling
(which I shall name at this time) is that which <HI>Peter</HI>
himselfe doth expresse, in 2 <HI>Pet. 1. Give all deligence to make
your calling and election sure;</HI> How shall they do that? he tels
us in <HI>ver. 5. Moreover adde to your faith virtue, and to virtue know∣ledge,</HI>
&amp;c. He reckons sundry sorts of graces, and he calls up∣on
them to adde grace to grace and one degree of grace to a∣nother;
<HI>and</HI> (saith he) <HI>if these things dwell in you, and abound,</HI>
by this means an open entrance shall be ministred unto you
abundantly into the everlasting kingdome of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, as if men that did not grow in grace,
and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow from grace to grace; if they get to heaven at length,
they must mend their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, thrust and croud for it; but
if these things be in you and abound, so an open entrance
shall be ministred unto you; as if the great gates of Heaven
were opened to you: there must be a growing, you are blind
else, and cannot see afar off; you shall not see your state, un∣lesse
you grow from faith to faith, and from knowledge to
knowledge, then an open entrance shall be ministred to you,
that you shall die in full assurance of faith, and of the love of
God: And thus shall a man make his calling and election
sure; and by so doing, he shall make sure to himselfe his pre∣serva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
from this world, and shall be translated to everla∣sting

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Rev. 13. 8. latter part of the vers.</BIBL>
<Q>The Lamb slaine from the foundation of the
world.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THere remayns now the latter part of this vers, which
is a description of Jesus Christ: and he is described.</P>
<P>1. By the similitude of a Lamb.</P>
<P>2. By his passion; <HI>He is slaine:</HI> And</P>
<P>3. <HI>By the antiquity of it;</HI> He is slaine from the foundation of
the world.</P>
<P>The note is this:</P>
<P>The Lord Jesus Christ was as a Lamb;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctrine 2.</NOTE> and though a Lamb, yet
was slaine: and though slaine in fulnesse of time (about 4000. years
after the world began) yet in effect he was slaine from the foundati∣on
of the world.</P>
<P>This is the sum of this latter part of the verse. Not to stay
long in any of these things, and put to stay upon them, be∣cause
they are principles of our Christian faith; and princi∣ples
may not be passed over in hast, especially considering
the handling of them is a speciall branch of our calling. <HI>Be∣hold
the Lamb of God</HI> (saith <HI>John) that taketh away the sinnes of
the world,</HI> John 1. 29. 36. It was his particular office to point
at Christ, and he doth it under the notion of a Lamb: So it
is said, <HI>A Lamb stood upon mount Zion,</HI> Rev. 14. 1.</P>
<P>Now why a Lamb? In a double respect (and I speak of no
more then what the Scripture hath respect unto:)</P>
<P>First, in respect of his innocency.</P>
<P>2ly. In respect of his meeknesse and patience.</P>
<P>1. His innocency.</P>
<P>1. <HI>In his birth:</HI> That holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall
be called the sonne of God, <HI>John</HI> 1. 35.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="82"/>
2. <HI>Innocent in his life.</HI> It behooves us <HI>(saith Christ to</HI> Iohn)
to fulfill all righteousnesse, <HI>Mat. 3. 15. And in</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 22. He
did no sinne, neither was guile found in his mouth.</P>
<P>3. Innocent also in his death. <HI>Pilate</HI> bare him that re∣cord,
<HI>Mat.</HI> 27. 24. when he had heard all things that were
born witnesse against him, hee tooke water and wash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his
hands before the multitude, saying, <HI>I am innocent of the blood of
this just person.</HI></P>
<P>And as he was thus innocent as a Lamb: So he was meeke
and patient as a Lamb: and the holy Ghost hath respect unto
it, <HI>Acts 8. 32. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a
Lamb dumb before the shearers, so opened he not his mouth.</HI> And
therefore there is something respected in his silence and quiet
subjection to the slaughter knife: And his patience or meek∣nesse
doth expresse it self in two things chiefly.</P>
<P>1. In submitting not himself only, but his will to his fa∣thers
will. <HI>Father,</HI> saith Christ (in his agony in the Garden)
<HI>if it be possible, let this cup passe from me, neverthelesse not as I will,
but as thou wilt. And if this cup may not passe away from me except
I drinke it, thy will be done,</HI> Mat. 26. 39. 42 And that is pro∣perly
after Gods own heart, when a mans heart is subdued to
the will of God; in which respect he did not murmure at his
Fathers hand, nor did expostulate his being delivered into
the hands of wicked men, 1 <HI>Pet. 2. 23. Who when he was revi∣led,
reviled not againe; when he suffered, he threatned not, but com∣mitted
himselfe to him that judgeth righteously:</HI> And so meek was
be in this very kind, as that be prayed for his very enemies
and persecutors. <HI>Luk. 23. 34. Then said Jesus, Father forgive
them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>2. His patience and meeknesse stood in keeping silence in
his own just defence. <HI>As a Lamb dumb before the sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arer,</HI> kee∣ping
silence before his Accusers, and Judges, and Condem∣ners.
He answered nothing before the high Priest; any thing
that might tend to his crucifying, as he doth expresse: If they
will make it a point to crucifie him, because he said, <HI>He was
the son of God:</HI> Saith he, <HI>I came into the world to bear witness unto
that.</HI> When <HI>Pilate</HI> did accuse him, he answered nothing, and
the Governour wondred at it, knowing that hee could tell
<PB N="156" REF="83"/>
what to answer: He marvailed that so just a man, in so just a
case did not answer a word which did so narrowly concern
him: But he did not know what the cause was, that he was
as a Lamb dumb before the shearer, and before the slaughter
also.</P>
<P>What might be the reason then of this Lamb lik innocen∣cy
and meeknesse of Christ? (They are principles, and ought
to be incultated often:)</P>
<P>The first ground is,</P>
<P>To fulfill the types that went before of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> <HI>Exod</HI> 12. 5.
The paschall Lamb was without blemish. And <HI>Exod.</HI> 29 39.
The daily Sacrifice was to be a Lamb without spot and ble∣mish,
therefore Christ must be such.</P>
<P>The second Reason is taken from his personal union with
the second person in Trinity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> <HI>For in him dwelleth all the ful∣nesse
of the God-head bodily,</HI> Col. 2 9. that is personally: So
that Christ must be a sinner, if in any thing Christ had fai∣led
either in doing or suffering (which were blasphemy to
say): And hence springs an utter impossibility of his man∣hood,
acting any thing without the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d head acting by
him; for the Son can do nothing of himselfe, but as he seeth
the Father do.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> there is a further necessity of his Lamb-like inno∣cency:
From our necessity of such a Sacrifice, and such an
high Priest as was holy, and blamelesse, and undefiled, <HI>Heb.</HI>
7. 26, 27, 28. Such an high Priest it behooved us to have:
Yea, it was requisite the Sacrifice should be blamelesse, <HI>Levit.</HI>
1. 3. And the Priest that offered it to be so also, <HI>Levit.</HI> 21. 18.
For otherwise he could not make attonement for us, nor
could his attonement be accepted.</P>
<P>But why was he thus patient, silent, and meek? a double
reason of that.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> That his Sacrifice might be voluntary, and so ac∣cepted
of the Father. <HI>Sacrifice and offering for sinne thou wouldst
not, neither hadst pleasure therein,</HI> which are offered by the law;
Then said he, <HI>Loe I come to doe thy will, O God,</HI> Heb. 10. 8, 9.
Whoever was to offer a Sacrifice, was to bring it himselfe,
and deliver it up, and himselfe with it, and it must be offered
<PB N="157" REF="83"/>
willingly: Wheeher it was the Congregation that had com∣mitted
a sinne, or whether it were any particular person,
they were to bring their oblation: Any Sacrifice that a man
would have accepted, he must bring it to the door of the Ta∣bernacle,
<HI>Lev.</HI> 4. 4. 14. 23. The Priest must not fetch it: If a∣ny
would bring their Sacrifice they might; but if they were
extorted from them, they were not accepted: So the Lord Jesus
must come and freely offer up himselfe, as one that was to be
presented in the stead of all the Elect: Hee offered himselfe a
Surety of the Covenant; we should have brought it, but we
had it not in our hearts: But hee brings himselfe, and layes
downe his life of himselfe, and takes it up againe, <HI>John</HI>
10. 18.</P>
<P>And 2ly. why did he expresse his patience in that silence of
his? The reason was from this very cause, even</P>
<P>From the want of sufficient matter to give a just Answer in
our behalfe by all things that he could alledg for us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> If hee
had stood in his own person, and had had nothing to do
but to cleare himselfe, he had had a world to have answered
for himselfe, and this <HI>Pilate</HI> saw; for he said that he was a
King, but a King of another world, and <HI>Pilate</HI> knew that
there was no <HI>Cesarian</HI> Law that did forbid a Kingdome in a∣nother
world: but standing in our persons, hee knew not
what to answer: What could there be charged upon Christ,
but we have been guilty of it? Can it be sayd that none of
the Elect of God did blaspheme? and that none of them did
destroy the Temple of God? and can it be justified that all the
Elect of God have been freed from commotions? Can any
undertake that defence for the elect of God? What sinne can
you charge upon him, but some of the servants of God have
been guilty of it? Therefore it is, that the Lord Jesus an∣swers
not: He doth not deny, he doth not out-face them in
the businesse: It is not so with him; He is not such an Advo∣cate:
He pleads with a good conscience when he pleads, and
he is clear, but he cannot clear his Elect ones from Church-censure,
and Civill censure: Nor doth he plead with God a∣bout
any kind of hard-ship, in putting upon him that extre∣mity,
he knew the elect of God had deserved such: And
<PB N="158" REF="84"/>
though he knew that they dealt wickedly, yet standing in
our room, hee had not a sufficient plea, let them charge him
with what they will: A man cannot charge him with any
sinne, but some of his Elect have been guilty of it, and
therefore what can be answered? Therefore he was not wil∣ling
to excuse himselfe: He doth neither deny nor extenu∣ate
any Crime that can be layd ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst him; but take it in its
full rigour, and the accusation doth stand good: They stand
not good against the Principall, but against the Surety, as
hee is a Surety, they stand good against him; for as it is
in <HI>Job 9. 2, 3. How should man be just with God? If hee will con∣tend
with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</HI></P>
<P>Let a man stand before the Tribunall of the justice of God,
and he cannot answer one of a thousand: And if Christ be
to stand for all the elect of God, hee cannot answer one of a
thousand: And therefore when the King came to see the
man in the room that had not on the wedding Garment, the
man was speechlesse; which plainly shewes us, that if Christ
stand in the room of Gods people, the case stands so, that
Christ cannot answer for us, to excuse us. <HI>Job</HI> could not
answer one of a thousand, though he was the perfectest man
in his Generation (and I know not whether any man after
him that was more innocent then he:) And what shall o∣thers
of Gods called ones be able to doe? and what they are
not able to doe, the Lord Jesus Christ hee doth carry it in
the same manner, as one that cannot excuse them from being
guilty of those sinnes, no more then himselfe can.</P>
<P>Thus you see the reasons both of Christs innocency and
patience.</P>
<P>The use of the point is,</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> to convince us of the guilt of all the elect people of
God, and their guiltinesse even of violent death, and unexcu∣sablenesse
under that death. If so be we had been innocent,
what needed Christ to have been so patient as hee was, so
Lamb-like in his innocency? His Lamb-like innocency is an
argument of our guiltinesse: The servants of God, especially
such as take any more narrow search of their own waves,
they see themselves full of blemishes, spots, and wrinckles,
<PB N="159" REF="84"/>
and many such things, <HI>Isa. 64. 6. We are all as unclean things,
and all our righteousnesses are as filthy ragges.</HI> They are all as the
clouts of a mensteruous woman, even all our best righteous∣nesse:
This this the condition of us all, full of uncleanesse,
and pollution, and deformity: And wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch is worse then that,
unexcuable in all: for if wee cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have told what to say,
and to say justly, Christ would have sayd it much more fully
then we could; for he is our Advocate, and it were a shame
for an Advocate, if the party of the cause could defend his
cause better then his Advocate: Christ is more skilful in the
Law then we; but his silence doth professe, that he knows
not what to say, to stand out in our defence. He might have
excused some of Gods elect from this or that actual grosse
Sinne; but he could have excused none from a guilty prone∣nesse
to all manner of Sinne: There is a vicious pronenesse
in us to all sinne, and therefore Christ could not tell what to
say. And as there is a pronenesse in us to all sinne, so there
is an actuall commission of many sinnes, <HI>And in many things
we sinne all,</HI> James 3. 2. And there are few or none of Gods e∣lect;
that if so be a man that is privy to all their dealings,
were to give an account of them, he could not justifie them
from the guilt, and stain of all sinne. Now this is the case of
Christ, he hath been acquainted with all our wayes; and if he
be examined of what hath been done wickedly, before the
Church, and before the Common-wealth, he is not able to
deny, but both Church and Common-wealth might proceed
against us all. And this may cast a holy blushing upon us in
the presence of the Lord, and of this Lamb: Christ could
have told what to have answered, if ought had been to be
answered; but when he stands in our room, he stands silent:
he could not with truth bear witnesse unto any of us touching
our guiltinesse: knowing what he knew by us, it would
make us unfit for both societies, either of Church or Com∣mon-wealth.
And it is a just humiliation for a man to know
that he stands in such a state, of which no good account can
be given: A man that is skilful indeed, and knows the Law
as well as Christ did, standing in our room, he hath nothing
to answer for himselfe, and the Lord knows it, and time was
<PB N="160" REF="85"/>
when this considered did muzz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his mouth, <HI>he was like a lamb
dumbe before his shearer:</HI> you cannot rake up such a base accu∣sation
against him, but he knows where the dint of it will
fall, and therefore he is very sensible of the truth of all that is
laid unto his charge. Let God come upon us with spiritual
dissertions, we must know that it is just with God to dissert
us; and though the Church should spue us out, and the Com∣mon-wealth
cut us off from the land of the living, who can
plead for us? If Christ stand in our persons, he hath nothing
to plead.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> it doth teach us, where to look for all our justi∣fication
and reconcilement with the Father. Truly brethren
not in our own righteousnesse, for the Lord himselfe that
knowes it better then we do, he knows that it will not hold
out before the judgement seat of God. He might have plea∣ded,
that <HI>David</HI> was a man after Gods own heart; he might
have pleaded the wisedome of <HI>Solom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n;</HI> and the truth of <HI>Jo∣sias</HI>
heart, and the zeal of <HI>Phineas,</HI> and the patience of <HI>Job:</HI>
but he knowing the Law well enough, and what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y have
been, (and we have all been) he hath nothing to plead; and
therefore we must not plead our own righteousnesse: let no
man think that his own pleading will reach his own justifi∣cation,
whereas Christ himselfe could not reach it for him.
<HI>All have sinned, all have been out of the way, and there is none that
doth good no not one,</HI> Psal. 14. 1, 2, 3. he speaks of us by nature,
and we were natural, before we came to be spiritual: There∣fore
saith the Apostle, <HI>What things soever the Law saith it saith to
them who are under the Law, that every mouth may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and

use the Apostle himselfe makes of it, <HI>Vers. 23, 24, 25▪ We
have all sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being justified

whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,
to declare his righteousnesse, for the remission of sinnes that are past,
through the forbearance of God.</HI> So that (I say) this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
of our justification; the Lord J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus hath borne, and suffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed

justifie themselves; they will bring you many instances of this
Saint, and that Saint, (and of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> above all o∣thers)
of their purity, and righteousnesse, and how able they
are to plead for others: They may be wise for themselves,
and do as Procters are wont to do, regard their fees, and not
their Cause: but the Lord Jesus is faithful, and yet he cannot
plead as guiltlesse: Nor must you think, as sometimes poor
christians will do; I cannot say much for my selfe, but such
a brother, such a sister, they may indeed give a better account
of me then I can do of my selfe; but truly, nothing to satis∣fie
Gods justice, can any give account, for Christ himself could
not do it: And indeed so marvellously did God accept this
kinde of defence that our Saviour makes, that he hath crow∣ned
this faithfulnesse of Christ with everlasting honour unto
all ages: he hath so fully, so gratiously accepted him, as that
he hath for ever ratified it in Heaven, that no man shall ever
passe away righteous from the judgement seat of God that
can plead any righteousnesse of his own: Whoever he be that
will not stand righteous before the judgement seat of God by
any righteousnesse of his own, he must stand mute as Christ
himselfe stood: and if he be just, he must be just by his righ∣teousnesse.
Christ could plead nothing for us of our own,
not our active obedience, nor any passive obedience of ours:
but he having suffered for us, the punishment that all the
wickednesse of the Elect have deserved, <HI>Now he doth ever live to
make intercession for us,</HI> Heb. 7. 25. Now he hath arguments e∣nough
to plead: <HI>If any man sin now, we have an Advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, 2 John</HI> 2. 1. Why did he not
plead before? Truly he could not open his mouth before,
because he had not yet suffered: but now he hath suffered,
the just for the unjust, and now that he hath borne the censure
of Church and Common-wealth, now he hath enough to
plead in the behalfe of the poorest christian. And if so be
that any plead against his Saints and servants, and say that
they are guilty of these &amp; these sins, God wil say, <HI>Deliver him
from going down to the pit; I have found a ransome,</HI> Job 33. 24.
He now pleads satisfaction to the justice of his Father; and
having satisfied for all, there is a sufficient plea in his mouth
<PB N="162" REF="86"/>
for all the Elect of God: whatever our actual transgressions
have been, the Lord hath aboundant plea for all his people:
that so he may both obtain of the Father, the spirit to bestow
good things upon us; and having given us such things, as
faith, and love, and repentance, he may plead our sincerity of
heart, and that argues communion with himselfe, and saith
in his bloud: But that which doth make us stand righteous
before him is this, that he himselfe was a Lamb without spot,
and yet did not plead his own innocency, but did bear all for
us, and for us all, that we might ever be righteous in the sight
of God. And thus will God have all his servants plead, or
else they shall not have salvation.</P>
<P><HI>First to plead silence;</HI> That then thou mayest remember, and be
confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame,
when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the
Lord God, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 63.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly to plead our iniquity,</HI> Psal. 51. 3, 4. I acknowledg
my transgression, and my sinne is ever before mee: Against thee
onely have I sinned and done this evill in thy sight, that thou mightest
be justified when thou speakest <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But purge me with by sope and I
shall be clean.</P>
<P>Looke therefore unto this point mainly and principally,
that if we come to plead before the Lord our God, hee doth
require we should examine our selves, and in the end be so
surprized (when we have done) as not to have what to an∣swer.
Christ could not tell what to answer, and we must
not wonder, if wee doe not finde what to answer: For here
God magnifieth his love in setting forth himselfe unto a be∣liever,
to be a God justifying him that cannot justifie him∣selfe:
He seeth there is the way of the grace of God, the Lord
hath done this in Christ; and the manifestation and declara∣tion
of it doth so possesse the hearts of Gods children, that
it causeth them to cleave unto him for all their righteous∣nesse
and peace: And this is of great necessity, and of conti∣nuall
practice for the Saints of God to attend unto, that we
might not be at a losse in this great question of our soules.
Conscience cryes out unto us, and wee know not in the
world what to say, for wee are wicked beyond measure in
<PB N="163" REF="86"/>
the sight of God, our own sincerity will not plead our righ∣teousnesse
before God: But all it will do, will come to this
end, that we shall be convinced, we have nothing to say:
(Nay an Angel, nay the Sonne himselfe could not tell what
to say for us) but wee look to be justified freely by his grace:
And the God of all grace doth so justifie Christs cause, that
all the world that are justified, shall be justified by his plea,
who hath done all things for us that concern our everlasting
salvation.</P>
<P>For a third use of the point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> it may be for reproof to un∣conscionable
Advocates (but I have not I thinke so much
cause to speak of it here, but in most places of the world I
might speak of it) It might teach all Advocates to take heed
of bolstering out a bad Case by qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks of wit, and tricks and
quilets of Law, the Lord abhors such things. If you will
have the Lord to smell a savour of rest, plead the cause of the
faithful, and of the widow, but thou shalt not accept the
person of the poor, nor of the rich. And for men that pro∣fesse
Religion (as many Lawyers do) to use their tongues as
weapons of unrighteousnesse unto wickednesse, it is a pro∣fessed
practice against the doctrine of mortification; For a
man to give his tongue (his glory, as <HI>David</HI> calls it) to be∣come
a member of unrighteousnesse, to plead in corrupt Cau∣ses,
and to strain the Law to that purpose, were I to speake
in place where, I should think it meet to speak more. But I
shall not be accounted a good Lawyer, may some say: No,
Christ was the best Advocate that ever was, and yet he could
not answer: Let the cause be what it is, where the tree fals,
let it lye: If Christ do keep silence in point of our righteous∣nesse,
let us keep silence also in point of our own.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> It may be a use of instruction unto all those
that professe fellowship with Christ, and the saving know∣ledg
of Christ Jesus: You see here how Christ is described, <HI>a
Lamb slaine from the foundation of the world;</HI> None more inno∣cent,
and yet none more me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient.</P>
<P><HI>If you speak of Christ as a Minister, the spirit of a Dove
doth come upon him. For the Sacrifice, he is a Lamb.</HI> The

the hole of the Aspe, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the
Cock-atrice den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy moun∣taine,
<HI>Isa.</HI> 11. 6. to 9.</P>
<P>Doe you see a man boysterous in his spirit, and in his own
will and wayes, and will not be willing to see a difference
in himselfe from the spirit of Christ Jesus (as it is possible
that a child of God may be rough in his way, yet hee dare
not allow himselfe long in it, it is a body of death: But)
if you see a man that doth allow himselfe in a passionate
frame of spirit, that a man will have his owne will (and
will not be crossed in it) whether it be right or wrong,
doubtlesse this is not the spot of Gods children; It is not the
spirit of those whose names are written in the Lambs b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok
of life. God did not indeed elect us, because either we are
such, or would be such, but he did elect us to be made such
first or last, before we come to enjoy the everlasting Inheri∣tance
which this book hath written us downe unto. And
therefore it must cut off all our boysterousnes and churlishnes
of spirit; all this ruggednesse and churlishness it must be ta∣ken
off; <HI>The wolf shall dwell with the Lamb and the Leopard shall lye
downe with the kid, and a little child shall lead them:</HI> Therefore
all bitternesse of contention, and pangs of passion that pre∣vaile,
that are farre from the spirit of love, must be removed:
But this will prevaile in all Gods people, that God will car∣ry
an end your spirits, in conformity to the spirit of his own.
Be of that spirit therefore in all your Transactions, that is to
say, mild, and patient, and innocent: And so it will re∣quire
all the children of God in the same kind, to keep Lamb-like
silence, when you are charged with any fault whereof
you are guilty.</P>
<P>It is a dangerous sinne when men are found in a fault, they
have a thousand excuses for it, and utter denyal of such
things, so as they will cut you a Weavers beame unto a very
moate: But you see the spirit of Christ Jesus will not doe it,
<PB N="157" REF="87"/>
nor will he confesse it, for they charged it upon him in his
own person, and so he could not confesse it: Hee could not
deny it, because then he should not have stood in our room
as he did. And therefore it behooves those that are young or
old; if you be innocent, then you may excuse it; if you be
guilty, beware of denying, for if you do, you shall leave a
difficult travayl upon Jesus Christ to plead your cause: He
that knoweth the heart, and the truth of the thing, he is a∣shamed
of such a proud spirit, that so defends himself as you
doe.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 5.</NOTE> it is a ground of singular comfort to all <HI>whose names
are written in the Lambs booke of life,</HI> and brought on to this
Lamb-like frame of heart, in the greatest horrour of spirit,
whereas the soule in this or that man is confounded, and he
knows not what to say: Here is comfort for such a soule laid
up, for here is a sufficient plea before Gods Judgment seate,
the Lord Jesus Christ hath been silent at it, he hath born and
suffered for it. It will come unto this passe with a soule un∣der
spiritual confusion: Wee shall lye downe in our shame,
with our confusion upon our faces, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 24, 25. Wee
cannot deny it, nor excuse it, and therefore we are ready to
conclude, woe to us that ever we were born; That is not a
just conclusion though, for truly this we must come unto, if
ever we come unto Christ: And therefore it is a way of ju∣stification,
and of life for a man to be confounded in himselfe
for his sin, for the Lord doth never justifie a sinner, untill hee
hath confounded him.</P>
<P>Many a man many times will say, it is true, godly friends
have had a good opinion of me, but they are deceived by my
expressions, performances, and outward carriage; Here the
soule is mady times apt to sinke, and would sink, if the Lord
Jesus stood not at a non-plus in his room; for Christ could
not tell what to say, till hee had made satisfaction; neither
could he acknowledg the faults that were layd to his charge,
because himselfe was guiltless; not deny them, lest he should
falsly justifie us.</P>
<P>We cannot tell now what to say to our owne estates some∣times;
The Church complaines, all our Prophets are gone,
<PB N="166" REF="88"/>
and our signes are gone, the case is now desperate, when wee
are in a desperate taking: But though wee cannot tell pre∣sently
what to say, yet the Text and the Gospel tels you,
<HI>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world.</HI> He
himself could make no words about our justification, it was
a case past words, excuses would not heale us, then there
was something to be suffered, and that to the utm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st: This
he hath suffered, <HI>wherefore he is able to save them to the utmost
that come unto God by him, Heb.</HI> 7. 25. He is now able to
do it; but when he stood before <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> he could not
tell what to say, but now he hath suffered in Family, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch
and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmon-wealth. In his family, they forsook him, and
denyed him, and forswore him; therefore now having made
perfect satisfaction unto the exact justice of his heavenly Fa∣ther,
by being condemned to death, crucified upon the
Crosse, dead and buried, now his mouth is ever open to
make intercession: There is a stay and staffe unto a Christi∣an:
<HI>Looke unto me, and be yee saved all the ends of the earth,</HI>
Isa. 45. 22. Now here is the brazen Serpent lifted up, <HI>That
whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting
life,</HI> John 3. 14, 15.</P>
<P>Rest not now in a naked knowledge of this, but look up to
Heaven with your inner man, be confounded because of your
shame, and yet see the Lord offering you Christ, and giving
you grace to receive him and to rest there, that whatever ca∣vils
and temptations the Devil may make, and your own
consciences may make, yet there is hope in <HI>Israel</HI> concerning
this: <HI>The Lord is righteous, but I and my house are wicked,</HI> may
a man say, my wayes are corrupt, and my heart worst of
all: <HI>But the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all, and by
his stripes we are healed,</HI> Isa. 53, 5, 6, 7.</P>
<P>There is nothing that will cleare him before God, when
he stands in our case, but he must stand ashamed and con∣founded
for us all: And though wee be thus and thus guil∣ty
in our owne apprehensions, and culpable in the sight of
men, yet the Lord hath made satisfaction for us, and
therefore saith, Deliver him, for I have received a ran∣some:
And where there is any seede of God, there will be
<PB N="167" REF="88"/>
a secret quieting of the heart upon this very ground,
which the Lord doth dart into the soule, by causing it to rest
upon him, and cleave to him, and hang about him, where
onely Redemption, Reconciliation, and Attonement for
us are to be found.</P>

<Q>The Lamb slaine from the foundation of the
world.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>CHrist is here described. First by the similitude of a
Lamb. 2. By his passion, <HI>a Lamb slaine.</HI> Thirdly, his
passion is amplified by the antitiquity of it, <HI>slain from
the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P>We shewed the last time, that Christ was as a Lamb. Now
we come to the next part of the description of Christ; the
next note then concerning Christs passion is this.</P>
<P>Christ though a Lamb was slain and slaughtered.</P>
<P><HI>Though a Lamb.]</HI> That is to say, though innocent, meek,
and patient, yet slain and slaughtered: So you read in <HI>Acts
2. 23. Him being delivered by the determinate councell and fore-knowledge
of God, yee have taken, and by wicked hands have cruci∣fied
and slain;</HI> and in <HI>Acts 7. 52. You have slain them which shewed
before of the coming of the just one, of whom you have been now
the betrayers and murderers.</HI> He was a Lamb murdered, slain, and
slaughtered; <HI>He was led as a Lamb to the slaughter.</HI> Slaughter
implyes a violent death put upon him, partly by the justice
of God, partly by the wickednesse of men, and partly by the
malice of Satan. By the justice of God: the word is very
strong in <HI>Isa. 53. 10. It pleased the Lord to bruise him,</HI> it is tran∣slated,
but it signifies properly to grind him: the same word
is translated destruction in <HI>Psal. 90. 3. Thou turnest man to de∣struction:</HI>
and so it pleased the Father thus to grinde him to
powder that he might have nothing of chaffe; he ground
him to dust with grief, and horror, anguish, and agony, and
terrour, and pain, Isa. 53. 6. <HI>The Lord laid upon him the iniquity of
us all:</HI> and so he ground him to dust for our transgressions, I
<PB N="169" REF="89"/>
mean to dissolution of soul and body. And so by the wick∣ednesse
of men, he was accused, condemned, and according∣ly
executed. <HI>What think you of him</HI> saith <HI>Caiphas, you have heard
his blasphemies; and they answered and sayd, he is guilty of death,
Mat.</HI> 26. 66. And <HI>Pilate</HI> himselfe, though he thought him to
be guiltlesse, yet delivered him to be crucified, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27▪ 26.
And the people sayd, <HI>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to
dye,</HI> John 19. 7. Thus was he delivered by the wickednesse
of men: <HI>and</HI> Pilate <HI>knew they did it of envy,</HI> Mat. 27. 18. So
that it was a great wickednesse in <HI>Pilate</HI> to gratifie the people,
and to suffer such an innocent Lamb to be crucified; yet ra∣ther
then he will loose the favour of <HI>Caesar,</HI> and of the people,
he delivers him to be crucified.</P>
<P>And which is more then so; as he dyed by the justice of
God, and the wickednesse of men, so by the malice of Satan:
for our Saviour saith in <HI>Luke 22. 52. This is the very hour and
power of darknesse.</HI> The gates of Hell were opened to powre
upon him all the vengence they were able. It was fore-tould
in <HI>Gen. 3. 15. It shall bruise they head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</HI>
The Serpent should bruise his heel, that is Christ, the seed of
the woman. His heel, you will say that falls far short of death;
to pinch a man on the heele, it may make him go lamely, but
not kill him: but the holy Ghost intends, that all the mis∣chief
that Satan works against Christ or any of his members,
it doth but reach to the bruising of the heele. It bruised his
heele, that implies, that Christ should have a body like ours:
and his heele, that is the lower part of Christ, his humanity,
Satan should bruise it. <HI>And he shall break thy head;</HI> it is the
same word, and therefore you may take them both for
breaking, or both for bruising: therefore <HI>Peter</HI> expounds it
well (in 1 <HI>Pet. 3. 18.)</HI> when he tells you Christ suffered for
sinne, <HI>The just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being
put to death in the flesh:</HI> His heele was brused, that is, his flesh.
So that though the Lord suffered unsupportable misery, to be
forsaken of his Disciples, betrayed by one, and forsworn by
another, to be forsaken of his Father in regard of any com∣fortable
fellowship he had with him: Though he suffered all
this, in inward and outward man, to such extremity that
<PB N="170" REF="90"/>
made him sweat drops of blood, and in the end to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve up
the ghost, yet all this was but the heele, the lower part of
Christ as it were; for his personal union is not in the least
measure intercepted: his head and councel stands sure, and
all his indeavours will finde a blessed accomplishment.
Whereas the Lord breakes the head of Satan, not onely cuts
him off from all hope of fellowship in grace, but all his plots
shall be disappointed at length, and all execution of his de∣signes,
they shall be brused: the Sonne of God comes to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣solve
the works of Satan, to undoe them. Thus comes the
Lamb to be slaine. The reason of the point is double.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> to fulfil all the former types of the Legall Sacrifices.
The Israelites were to slay the Paschal lamb in the evening (at
the ninth hour of the day) <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 6. about the same time
he was slain: And all other Sacrifices for reconciliation
were to be killed, necessary therefore he should be slain; The
daily Sacrifice which consisted of a Lamb in the morning, and
a Lamb in the evening, were both slaine, though without ble∣mish,
and so was Christ. But that was but a shadow, for
Christs suffering was rather the cause of them: but it is
the Scripture phrase, this was done, that this and that may
be fulfilled, because such a thing in after times was fulfil∣led.</P>
<P>Secondly, the cheif reason why it was requisite Christ should
be slaine, and why he would be slaine, was</P>
<P>That he might lay down his life for a ransome or price for
his people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> <HI>Mat. 20. 28. The Sonne of man came to give his life
a ransome for many.</HI> A ransome of what? or price of what?
The Scripture holds forth a price of Redemption, and a price
of Purchase.</P>
<P>A price of Redemption; <HI>We are not redeemed with Silver
and Gold, but with the precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lamb without
blemish and without spot, 1 Pet.</HI> 1. 18, 19, 20. He paid a price
for our redemption, that so he might discharge the debt of
our sinnes which lay upon us, <HI>Rom. 6. 23. Gen. 2. 17. What
day soever thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye.</HI> And partly by
this means to satisfie the justice of God, who had threatned
according to the curse of the Law, <HI>that cursed is every one that
<PB N="171" REF="90"/>
continues not in all things written in the Law to doe them:</HI> Be∣hold,
saith the Lord, I set before you life and death; obey it
and live, do it not, and dye; This is the sanction and ratifi∣cation
of the Law of God throughout the books of <HI>Moses.</HI>
And therefore that he might satisfie the Law, and the wrath
of God <HI>(Ezek. 18. 20. The soul that sinneth, it shall dye)</HI> that
he might discharge the debt wee ran into, and satisfie for our
defects, it was necessary to pay this price of redemption, to
save us from death, and all evils that drew on death. And
consequently therefore he hath saved us from sinne, <HI>Rev. 1.
5. He hath loved us, and washed us from our sinnes in his bloud. He
hath redeemed us also from the world,</HI> Gal. 1. 4. <HI>Who gave himselfe
for our sinnes, that he might deliver us from this present evill world:
and he hath also given himselfe unto the death, that he might destroy
through death, him that had the power of death, that is the Devill,</HI>
Heb. 2. 14. So this is one part of the reason, and the sum
of the ends why Christ gave himselfe to be slaughtered, and
his life as a price of redemption to redeem us from evill, for
redemption is from captivity and bondage from sinne and Sa∣tan,
and the world. This was a principal end of his death;
but it was but part of it. Here is a price to redeem us from
evil, from so many captivities wherein we were overwhel∣med.
But there is a price given of purchase, to the praise of
his glory, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1. 14. It is a price of purchase of some glo∣rious
possession: and for that end it was also given in a prin∣cipal
manner. Now what is the purchased possession which
the Lord hath given his bloud as a price to pay? Truly as
the Lord hath redeemed us from the three great enemies of
our souls, so he hath purchased the three greatest blessings the
sonnes of men are capable of, and they are the greatest bles∣sings
they can reach to.</P>
<P>1. He hath purchased reconcilement with the Father. <HI>He
hath reconciled us by the death of his Son,</HI> Rom. 5. 10. God loved
us indeed from eternity when he chose us, <HI>but we were by na∣ture
children of wrath as well as others.</HI> How came we to be re∣stored
and reconciled to the Father, from whom we fell as
much as we could, by the bloud of the Lamb, that hath re∣conciled
us to God.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="91"/>
Secondly, by his death, he hath paid a price of purchase
for union, and possession of union with the Sonne. So doth
the holy Apostle teach us, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. 13. to 16. <HI>You that
were sometimes farre off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ:</HI>
For he is our peace who hath made both one <HI>(Jewes</HI> and
<HI>Gentiles</HI> both one) and hath broken down the middle wall
of partition between us: So that he hath made <HI>Jewes</HI> and
<HI>Gentiles</HI> one houshold of God, and hath built us upon Jesus
Christ the cheif corner stone.</P>
<P>This is the second purchase which the Lord hath given
his blood for the price of. We had never been united to
Christ, nor by Christ been brought to the Father, but by the
bloud of his crosse: his blood hath flain all enmity between
God and us.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by the same price he hath also purchased us the
holy Spirit. These are the three persons in Trinity, a posse∣ssion
of Christ to be our head: of the Father to be our God
and King, and our Father, as his Father; therefore he tels
his Disciples in <HI>John</HI> 20. 17. saith he, <HI>Touch me not, for I go
to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as he had by death overcome death, <HI>now I go to my
Father and your Father:</HI> He hath purchased the possession of
Gods fatherly love: he hath also purchased union with
himselfe, and therefore he prayed that his passion might be
available to this end, that all that should beleive through the
Apostles preaching should be one with them, <HI>John 17 21, 23.
That they all might be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,
that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that
thou hast sent me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that
they may be one, even as we are one.</HI> So that this is the purchase
which the Lord by his blood hath purchased, reconciliation
with the Father, and union with the Sonne, and also the in∣habitation
of the holy Ghost, as 1 <HI>Cor. 3. 16, 17. Know yee
not that yee are the Temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwel∣leth
in you.</HI> And as he tels us in <HI>Ephes. 2. 18. Through him we
have an accesse by one spirit unto the Father.</HI> So that this is a
purchase of unspeakable blessings which the Lord hath given
<PB N="173" REF="91"/>
his blood for. It was not meet the blood of the Sonne of
God should be spilt in vain (it were abhomination to God)
therefore he gives it to avoyd the greatest evill that can befall
us, to cleanse us from sinne, and Satan, and to redeem us from
the curse of God; and to free us also from death, and hell,
and the world, and all the enemies of our souls.</P>
<P>He gave his blood for all this, not to redeem us from cros∣ses,
but from the curse in crosses, and that is the part which
drives us from God, <HI>Matth. 25. 41. Depart from me yee cursed.</HI>
So farre as any affliction might separate us from God, he
hath redeemed us from it.</P>
<P>Now from thence, as Christ hath given his blood for re∣conciliation
with the Father, and for union with the Sonne,
and for communion with the holy Ghost; so he hath given
his blood for the purchase of some blessings that flow from
these. For by communion with the spirit we have.</P>
<P>1. <HI>First communion with Christ in his death, mortifying
sinne, and communion with him in his resurrection raising
us up to righteousnesse. Whence the Apostle professeth,</HI> that he
desires to rejoyce in nothing but the crosse of Christ, whereby the world
is crucified to him, and he unto the world, <HI>Gal. 6. 14. And in</HI> Rom.
6. 6. Our old man is crucified with him, that the body of death might
be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sinne.</P>
<P>So there is the power of the spirit of Christ applying his
death, killing and crucifying sinne and the world in us, cru∣shing
the head of the Serpent, and consequently all the pow∣er
of the Beast, of the Catholick Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the
head of that Beast which is the Pope. He did therefore shed
his blood that he might destroy all the power of the enemy,
<HI>That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve
him without feare all the dayes of our life,</HI> Luke 1. 74. This is
the mighty power of the spirit applying the warme blood of
Christ to our foules.</P>
<P>2. The second fruit that flows from union with the blessed
Trinity, is ratification of the Covenant of Grace. And
Christ layd downe his bloud for that end to ratifie all the pro∣mises
that a reconciled God hath made; and that is God in a
<PB N="174" REF="92"/>
Covenant of Grace, <HI>That he will write his law in our hearts; that
he will forgive our sinnes, and remember our iniquities no more; that
we shall know him,</HI> Jer. 31. 33, 34. Christ gave his blood to
ratifie this Covenant, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 15, 16, 17. And as the Te∣stament
of a Testator stands not in force till the death of him
that made it, so the death of Christ ratifies this Covenant:
and as all the Covenants were confirmed by bloud, so hath
Christs blood done in a speciall manner. And when he
speaks of ratifying the Covenant, he doth not onely speak of
ratifying of it in word, but cheifly in the hearts of Gods peo∣ple;
and no price could have done that, but the blood of the
Sonne of God, by which he hath ratified all the promises of
God to the consciences of Gods people: That when the heart
and conscience of a sinner is overwhelmed with inward a∣gony,
and fear of the wrath of God, and the curse of the Law,
the fear of death and Hell: now what shall satisfie a christian
in this, but the death of Christ? and what shall ratifie it? His
death hath purchased reconciliation with the Father, union
with the Son, and communion with the holy Ghost; <HI>now he
hath shed his spirit in our hearts, whereby we cry Abba Father,</HI> Gal.
3. 14. This spirit of God works faith in the hearts of
Gods people, whereby all these promises are confirmed: they
are all certainly made good, because such is the value and
virtue of the death of this innocent lamb of God, they are
now free from the terrour of death. It was not possible the
bloud of Buls and Goats should take away sinne, therefore
still they had new sacrifices, for the conscience had lost the co∣py
by which it pleaded reconciliation by the spirit of God:
now he applying the death of Christ to the soul, doth fully
pacifie the conscience, and ratifie the Covenant to the soul,
that now all the promises of Grace belong to this or that ser∣vant
of Christ: and I pray mark it, because it is as weighty
as any point of Religion: And of all the doctrines of Reli∣gion,
there is none sanctified so effectually, and immediatly
to beget faith in the soul, as the preaching of the crosse of
Christ: All the doctrines of the Gospel are for the begetting
of faith, but they have no efficacy this way, further then they
are sprinkled with the blood of Christ: other promises do
<PB N="175" REF="92"/>
confirme faith, and they may also beget it, but it is with re∣ference
to the crosse of Christ. That which gives satisfacti∣on
to Gods justice, that gives satisfaction to our consciences,
for conscience is convinced, that if God deal in justice (as he
knows no reason but he should) then he of all men is most
miserable: the burden of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s lies heavy, and is ready to
plunge him to hell: what will satisfie the conscience now?
nothing in the world except it see some reason why Gods ju∣stice
should be satisfied; and how shall that be done? onely
by the death of the lamb of God. So that well doth the A∣postle
make the crosse of Christ the ratification of the Cove∣nant,
for that cuts of all sinne, and curse, and the rigor of the
Law, hell and death, and devill, and damnation, and all evil
that can befall us in this or another world, and doth satisfie
the justice of God that it might remove all these, and bears the
whole burden of the desert of our sinnes, purchaseth recon∣ciliation
with the Father, union with the Sonne, communion
with the holy Ghost. But what is all this to me, will the
soul say, unlesse these be so given that faith be wrought in my
heart to discerne all these, and finde them? The Lord doth
indeed all these; the spirit of God comes and so preacheth the
Gospel, and so applyes the Gospel, as that in preaching these
things, he doth beget faith in the heart to believe that all
these things are indeed belonging to such a soul, and to every
one whom he is pleased to accept, to the benefit of the crosse
of Christ, and to fellowship therein: and now indeed is the
whole Covenant of Grace confirmed when by the death of
Christ the virtue of it is applyed by the spirit to the soul:
Not that there is a reconcilement to God before faith, and
union with the Sonne, and communion with the holy Ghost
before faith: It is before in Gods purpose, and Christs pur∣chase,
but when the spirit comes to apply this (whose work
it is to give accomplishment to the work of the other per∣sons;)
he applying this, works saith, and ratifies the Cove∣nant,
and thereupon the heart is satisfied, and the justice of
God satisfied, and the spirit at rest from unsupportable an∣guishes
which did before plow up the tender heart of a christi∣an
that he lay sprawling as it were in his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="93"/>
3. A third benefit that flowes from the former in respect of
the price paid, and in regard of the virtue and efficacy of the
price when it comes to be applyed: you have not onely law∣full
right unto the creatures to eat and drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but some
right and title to them by the blood of Christ. And he hath
also paid a price for the possession of eternall glory. <HI>Ʋntill
the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory,
Ephes.</HI> 1. 14. Untill doth argue, that there is a purchase we
do not yet receive: and when shall that be received? when
both we our selves, and the creatures shall be redeemed to the
glorious liberty of the sons of God. Then shall we receive
the full benefit of the price which he hath paid whiles he suf∣fered
upon the Crosse. Therefore wonder not, that though
Christ being a lamb yet he was slain, that he being slain we
might be redeemed, and might enjoy the purchased possession,
redemption from all evill in every kinde, from sorrow, paine,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the evil of them. And his blood also was a price
for a purchased possession of reconciliation with the Father,
of union with the Sonne, of communion with the holy
Ghost; dominion over all sinne, ratification of the Cove∣nant
to our soules, and at length the possession of everlasting
glory. This was the reason why the lamb was slaine, and
had it not been for these divine, and supernatural, and bles∣sed
ends, he would not have prostituted his life to such a bit∣ter
and shamefull death, as the death of the Crosse was. It
was not meet the onely begotten Sonne of God should come
down into the world to lead a miserable life, and to dye an
accursed death, but for noble and glorious ends, and you have
the sum in these particulars.</P>
<P>For the use of it.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> it is a cause of just humiliation to us, whose sins were
so out of measure sinful, as that there is no ransome to be gi∣ven
for them, but such an invaluable price, as the blood of
the Sonne of God. All the Gold of <HI>Ophir;</HI> all that the
world can give, what is it, to this invaluable blood of the
Sonne of God? Yet this was our case, and estate, that if we
had had many worlds for our inheritance, and given them all
for the redemption of one soule, it had not been sufficient.
<PB N="177" REF="93"/>
This was our estate, and this is the estate of all such as yet live
in sinne to this day. It is a desperate estate that cannot be
repaired, nor themselves rescued from by ransome, but the
blood of Christ. If our sinnes had been of a lesse nature, a
lesse price might have made satisfaction: And yet such is the
pride of the hearts of the sonnes of men; that because we live
civil lives (though yet natural) we have good natures, are so
well bred, do so many good offices, that we think it is not so
dreadful a matter, nor that we are so dangerous for our estate
as others: If it go ill with us, what will become of desperate
roaring ruffines? whatever becomes of them, it is a frivolous
matter to you, or to such as are civil, and hinder the free pas∣sage
of the grace of God: but if our natures be so good, and
our carriage so comely, I pray you what need such an inva∣luable
price be given? If a small matter would have saved us
from the world, what need such an invaluable price be given
to rescue us from it? You will say, I hope I am not so addi∣cted
to the world, I would drive a bargaine home to the
head, and would not be cheated. But is that all you know
by your selves? certainly there is more; for if the Lord did
not see that inveglement which the word hath of us, and that
close combination of us to it, the Lord would not have
thought it needful to send his onely Sonne to redeeme us
from this present evill world. Frugality is not a vice in a∣ny,
but a virtue; and if there were no more but good hus∣bandry,
surely there need not such a price to be paid to re∣deeme
us from the world: But certainly the Lord sees such
power of worldlinesse, and untemperance in us, and such
power of passions and lusts, that no means would rescue us
therefrom but the power of the blood of his Sonne: and the
world hath such hold of us, and we of it, that if it were not
for the blood of the Sonne of God, we should never be rescu∣ed
from that engagement. And therefore let all flesh know,
there is that power of sinne, and of the world, in the best na∣tures,
and best education, that unlesse the Lord come with the
blood of his Sonne, we should be wedded to the world, and
our sins, and lusts, and perish everlastingly.</P>
<P>And for the Devil, you say you defie him, and did renounce
<PB N="178" REF="94"/>
him in Baptisme, and promise it, or some other in your
stead.</P>
<P>But if there were not a strong power of Satan in us, how
comes it that the blood of Christ must be shed, to destroy
him that had the power of death, <HI>that is the Devill, Heb.</HI> 2. 14.
And therefore consider of it, so strongly did the cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of the
Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reaten us, such power hath sin over the best nature,
that were it not for the blood of the Sonne of God, is
were not possible we should be redeemed from them.</P>
<P>Therefore if thou hast a good opinion of thy selfe, that the
world hath no hold of thee, nor thy passions and lusts, and the
Devill least of all, whatever the Law of God saith: know
that there was nothing could redeem us from this, but the
blood of the Sonne of God; and if thou dost not believe this
(however thou art thus naturally born) the truth is, thou
tramplest under foot the blood of Christ, as not worth the
spilling: If men be thus exact in their courses, so equal in
their dealings, if the Devil have no power over you, to what
end did he through death destroy the Devill that had the po∣wer
of death? If sinne have no dominion over you, where∣fore
did he shed his blood, that the power of sinne should be
destroyed? And therefore all the while a man is out of Christ,
and the warme blood of Christ is not applyed thee, thy soule
is a bleeding to death.</P>
<P>That look as it is with some men when in a consumption,
&amp; have little hope of recovery, then they wil kill some lamb,
and while it is warme, will take the warme body of the lamb
and fasten it to them that they may be repaired: Truly thus
doth the Lord with us, he knowes we are farre consumed, in
a state of worldlinesse, and a state of sinne, and Satan: how
shall the Lord rescue us, and repaire us? No way but this,
here is an innocent Lamb, he wraps him about us, warmes us
with his blood, and so he recovers us againe from our consu∣ming
condition, consuming with sinfull lusts, and passions,
and Satanical delusions. Look as Physitians, they will soon
ghesse what the disease is by the receipt: If the Lord prescribe
such a receipt as this, the blood of the innocent Lamb of God,
then know it for a certain truth, we were in a desperate con∣dition,
<PB N="179" REF="94"/>
consuming and wasting, and dead too, overspread
with the world and Satan, and so had everlastingly perished,
had not the Lord provided such a plaister as this.</P>
<P>And indeed this will yet humble us the more, in case the
Lord make it appear that all this is done for me, and thee;
we may say as <HI>Mephibosheth, 2 Sam.</HI> 19. 28 what are we, but
as dead dogs in the sight of God, that the Lord should give his
onely Sonne to recover such dead dogs as we from that wo∣full
estate in which we and our fathers lived, and many of
them dyed in, yet the Lord hath been more mercifull to us;
but what are we all but that the Lord might have cut us off?
Herein the Lord commends his love to us, <HI>that when we were
sinners Christ dyed for us,</HI> Rom. 5. 8.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> it may serve to teach us, the wonderful and un∣speakable
love of God and of his Christ to us; the one, that
was thus willing to send his Sonne, the other thus willing to
go, that his blood should be thus spilt like water upon the
ground, and himselfe cast aside of men for the while (but for
ever accepted of God) that we might be saved. Herein the
Lord magnifies his mercy to mankinde; his justice, that he
will be satisfied; his mercy, that he will have satisfaction in
his Sonne, and doth not require it of our persons. It is rich
Grace, that so we may stand, and wonder that the Lord should
ever do it to such as we, to give his Sonne (an innocent
Lamb) for us.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> it may teach us for ever to loath and abhor all
sinne, as that which so deeply displeaseth God, so as no satis∣faction
might be made for sinne, but the blood of his own
Sonne; and no blood could satisfie but that, and this sin
hath been the slaughterer of the innocent Lamb of God. It
provokes God greatly, and slaughters his own Sonne; this is
the power and venome of Sinne. And therefore unlesse we
take delight in the deep displeasure of God, which is unap∣peasable,
but in the blood of his Sonne, <HI>how shall we that are
dead to sinne, live any longer therein? Rom.</HI> 6. 2. He means dead
through Christ; Christ is dead, and we in him, and with him,
all that have fellowship with him.</P>
<P>Can we see the wrath of God rising again, first in our
<PB N="180" REF="95"/>
soules, and breaking forth in fiercenesse of the Lords indigna∣tion?
How shall we dare to tread under foot the blood of
the Covenant, as if it were an unholy thing? If there were
no other argument to discourage from sinne, this alone might
prevaile, the nature of sinne, that so deeply displeaseth God,
as there is no satisfaction but by the blood of Christ; and to
consider, that sinne hath slaughtered Christ Jesus. And there∣fore
the meditation of the slaughter and death of Christ,
should be as a slaughtering knife to cut asunder all temptati∣ons
to sinne. What is it that all pleasures and profits can
put upon us, to countervaile the losse of the favour of God,
and the blood of the Lamb? can any sinne procure the favour
of God, or any thing answerable to the favour of God? or
can any allurements of the world, or temptations that can
put upon us, or Satans suggestions; can they make the blood
of Christ an unworthy thing? or give us greater matters
then the blood of Christ hath purchased? And therefore
how shall we sinne against the love of God? <HI>how shall we com∣mit
this great wickedness, and sinne against God?</HI> sinne against the
blood of this immaculate Lamb of God. These very conside∣rations
are enough to cut off all sinne.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> this may serve therefore to teach us all to give
up our selves back again to Christ, that we may now live to
him. That we may now live to the father, and to the Son;
that we may not live to sinne, to Satan, to the world, <HI>But to
him that hath dyed for us, and given himselfe for us; I live by the
faith of the Sonne of God,</HI> Gal. 2. 20. <HI>Christ suffered for sinne, he
dyed for us, that we might not now live to our selves, nor to the lusts of
men, but to the will of God, 1 Pet. 4. 1, 2, 3. 2 Cor.</HI> 5. 15. So
that this is that which the Lord now cals us to, to wit, to live
now no longer to those things from which we were redeemed
by an invaluable price.</P>
<P>We are redeemed from the bondage of sinne, and Satan,
and from the world: and not onely redeemed from these,
but purchased to life, as a reconciled people to God, to be as
the friends of God: <HI>Abraham</HI> was called the friend of God.
Though a man make no bones of breaking out against an e∣nemy;
yet now being reconciled especially to him in whom
<PB N="181" REF="95"/>
we live, or move, and have our being, it is for us to walke as
those that are reconciled to God, as those that are united to
Christ, as those that are sanctified by his Spirit, as those that
have the grace of Christ applyed to our soules, <HI>as those that are
dead to sinne, and alive to righteousnesse;</HI> It is for us to walk as
those that look for a purchased possession to the glory of
Gods grace when this life shall be no more. If we be dead
with Christ, why are we not free from all that which is evil,
and free to all that is good? <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 20. It is a staine and ble∣mish
to the blood of Christ, to see a child of God live in any
durty corruption, to see a child of God a worldling, to yeild
to any temptation, it is a staine to the blood of Christ: To
see a child of God set loose from the Father, or the Sonne, or
the Spirit, it is a staine to the blood of Christ; for the blood
of Christ is a purchase to redeem us from all evill, and to pur∣chase
to us all good.</P>
<P>For a fifth use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 5.</NOTE> it may teach us to apply effectually the
blood of Christ: as we for our parts in our Ministery, so
you in your meditations, and repititions; there is the ground
of your peace. No conscience that hath been troubled with
sence of sinne, but there lies his grief, the wrath of God that
is upon his unbeleiving soule. He is condemned; <HI>the wrath
of God abideth on him.</HI> If you ransack it to the bottom, there
is it that crusheth the spirit: all other will be cast off in case
we be clear in this principle, about the satisfaction of Gods
justice provoked against us by our many and great transgres∣sions:
what shall satisfie the soule now? There is nothing
in the world so fit to beget faith, as the preaching of the cross
of Christ: <HI>If I be lift up from the earth, I will draw all men unto
me, John</HI> 12. 32. If Christ be drawn up on the Crosse, held
forth for his drawing of people that are troubled about the
wrath of God, and the removing thereof, and about satisfacti∣on
to God about all our iniquities, this will draw soules un∣to
him: For how will you uphold any man to bear his bur∣den
of the apprehension of Gods wrath with any tolerable
ease? No way but by holding forth Christ the innocent
Lamb of God, crucified upon the crosse, and his blood spilt
as a price of satisfaction to Gods justice, as a price of redemp∣tion
<PB N="182" REF="96"/>
from all evill, and purchase of all good: then saith the
soule, me-thinks there is some hope, even for me; For who
shall hinder the power of the blood of Christ? and who shall
hinder the free passage of Gods grace? if the Lord Jesus hath
undertaken it, and hold it forth especially to men that are
sick, and oppressed, and cast downe, and ready to perish for
want of succour: In such a case, while this is held forth,
there is the blood of Christ held forth, which was shed to pur∣chase
the spirit of grace; as it is written in <HI>Gal. 3. 13, 14.
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a
cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se for us, that we might receive the promise of the spirit.</HI> The same
blood of Christ, that hath redeemed us from the curse, and
hath purchased the communion of the spirit, he is wont in
the preaching of the crosse of Christ, to open Heaven to the
soule, to open the doors of the heart to beleive on this blood,
thus h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld forth, and so by this means you shall finde a sup∣port,
some satisfaction to all turmoils, and agonies of consci∣ende.
It is a wonder to see how this blood of Christ is migh∣ty
through God to make our peace, while the spirit doth con∣veigh
the efficacy thereof to the quieting, and establishing the
soule, In fellowship with Christ, and reconcilement with the
Father; that the soule sees, Christ hath not dyed in vaine,
that he hath not heard the word in vaine, nor waited upon
Christ in vaine, but sees there is life, and peace, and all in the
blood of Christ. And therefore wonder not now that the
Apostles were so carefull in preaching the crosse of Christ,
ther's the ground of all our reconciliation: That satisfies
the justice of God, and that satisfies the soule, the spirit ap∣plying
it begets faith to receive it; and there is they stay of
the soul.</P>
<P>So this is the principall duty, as for us to teach, so for
the people of God continually to attend unto, to ponder
upon this: especially those whose hearts are at a losse about
satisfaction of Gods wrath, and pardon of their sinne; It is
that which in a speciall manner they stand in need to attend
unto.</P>
<P>For a sixth use:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 6.</NOTE> If any man shall aske, how shall I know
that all this belongs to me? what it is for thee we cannot yet
<PB N="183" REF="96"/>
tell, in case a man have had no impression upon his soule
yet it may be to thee for ought thou canst tell, because all
the Elect are not yet called home, but are to be called:
Therefore it is not the thing, to say they have no hope in it,
because they are not yet washed by it, for they may be before
they dye.</P>
<P>But if for the present you would know whether you have
part in it or no: you see what the nature of it is, where the
blood of Christ comes, where it is sprinkled, you see what it
doth; it hath a redeeming power in it, and a purchasing
power: It doth redeem thee from all evill, from the power
of sinne, and Satan, and of this world, and of thine owne
heart, and withall from the wrath of God, and the curse of
the Law, so that the Conscience is more pure and peaceable
then before, and both these go together.</P>
<P>But mind what I say further, if this blood hath had this
free passage in thine heart, it hath purchased reconcilement
with the Father, union with the Sonne, communion with
the Spirit, conformity to Christ, and comforting thee in
Christ: Conforming thee to Christ in his death, and com∣forthing
thee in Christ and the fruits of his death, the favour
of God, and the pardon of sinne, and the blessed priviledges
that his death hath purchased. I say this is the efficacy of the
blood of Christ where it is received in power: If these fruits
be in us, they are lively pledges of the love of God in our
hearts: If these things be smothered and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubed, and over∣whelmed
with many Temptations, and worldly businesses,
distracting cares, and temptations; though it is true, the
children of God may be at many losses, yet mark what I say,
the blood of Christ is a living Spring, and a running Foun∣taine;
though it may be troubled, yet it will runne cleare
againe; if it do not, it is a signe it was not from the blood
of Christ, but from a delusion: But if it were from the
blood of Christ, thou shalt finde hee will purifie and pacifie
thy conscience, for he will not loose the value and efficacy
of that rich blood; great is the power of it, and he will not
loose the vertue of it.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="97"/>
I know there may be many pangs to Temptations, and
Christians in this new world may meet with new Temptati∣ons,
and Christians are at a losse because passions breake in,
we have lost all our peace, and comfort of our union, and the
power of it; it may be so, it is not unusuall; but (minde
what I say) truly if the blood of Christ have any efficacy in
us, or power upon us, you will find that the fountaine of
the blood of Christ is higher then any other fountain</P>
<P>A fountaine that springs from a low place may be stopped,
but if it comes from a high place, higher then the highest, no
creature here below can hinder it, nor created thing below
it can intercept the flowing of it: The Lord will redeeme
thee from the world, and from these passions and lusts, and
from the Satanicall, and malignant distempers, and the
Lords blood will restore thee to reconcilement with the Fa∣ther,
and bring thee to union with the Son, and the com∣fort
of the Spirit, and the sence of it. And therefore know,
if he have left thee to live in such distempers, and thou dost
blesse thy selfe in them, and canst not looke further, and
there is nothing in the blood of Christ that much takes up
thy heart, for redemption from evill, or purchasing good,
it is much to be feared thou hast not yet tasted of the blood
of Christ: what there may be in heaven wee know not, but
no man on earth can give thee a comfortable signe of a good
estate.</P>
<P>If a man blesse himselfe in these engagements, and in these
imbondagements to the enemies of his soule, and thinks his
captivity is his liberty, hee doth not know what the Lord
Jesus hath purchased, there is little hope such a man hath
redemption from the blood of Christ. This is the condition
of all the people of God in the greatest temptations, unlesse
it be in some extreame hurry of passion, it is a captivity to
him, and a burden to him that he wants Christ Jesus, and
that is a good signe of a mans liberty purchased by Christ:
This Christ who hath reconciled others to God, and done
great things for them in a way of grece, and hath also re∣conciled
him to God, and delivered him from death to see
this captivity, and to groane under it, it is a signe this man
<PB N="185" REF="97"/>
hath had some other liberty in times past: For otherwise there
is no man naturally but he thinks this is his freedom to have
his owne minde not crossed, to have his full liberty in the
world, to have good bargains, and not to be pinched in
this and that, and not for conscience to fly in his face; it is a
sign a man is yet a natural born captive. But when a man feels
his captivity, and looks at it as his burden, that he feeles not
the favour of God, and union with Christ, and communion
with the Spirit: It is a signe God hath called him to liberty,
but he hath sold himself for a captive again; &amp; now he cryes
as the Apostle, <HI>Rom. 7. 24. O miserable man that I am, who shall
deliver me from this body of death:</HI> There he is carryed captive.
<HI>I see another law in my members warring against the law of my
minde, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sinne which is
in my memebers,</HI> vers. 23. Here is a sign of redeeming love by the
blood of the Lamb.</P>
<P>O the wofull captivity that naturall corruption is to a re∣deemed
soule, and the great liberty it is to a carnall heart,
that hee thinkes it a liberty to have his thoughts free, and
none to tell him: But to a good conscience that hath been
washed and redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, the body of
death is a wofull bondage to him.</P>
<P>This body of death it is not actuall transgressions, but a
powerfull body of carnall corruption that hangs about us;
that though we do not break out into actuall sinnes as other
men do, yet we see a body of death in us, and this is our cap∣tivity.
So then, if the Lord hath redemed a soul, and pur∣chased
these comfortable blessings as brings us to the sence of
our wofull condition by reason of the losse of this liberty,
all these are witnesses of the redeeming love of Christ.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 7.</NOTE> it may be a use of consolation to every such soule
thus farre (even so farre as there is no bounds and limits to
it) it is a marvellous satisfaction to a soule in temptation,
nothing more then this I now speak of. One would think
it were a great misery to live in horrour of conscience conti∣nually,
and so it is: but if a man be redeemed by the blood
of this Lamb, then it is not terrour of conscience that can
<PB N="186" REF="98"/>
separate thee from God; for Christ himselfe was under ter∣rour
of conscience as much, and more then thou art with∣out
sin, that he sweat drops of blood, and cries out and be∣moans
it in a holy manner. Why will you say, but will you
have me set such things at my heele? the desertions of God
at my heele? Is the favour of God to be set a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the heele? it
will not hinder your union with your head, though you
have lost the sense of it.</P>
<P>All that Christ suffered, all his desertions, it did not hin∣der
his fellowship with the second person in Trinity, neither
will it hinder yours. The Serpent bruiseth our heel, makes
us go heavily and lamely. <HI>Psal. 43. 2. Thou art the God of my
strength, why dost thou cast me off? why goe I mourning because
of the oppression of the enemy?</HI> It makes us go heavily while
God forsakes us, as a man goes that is crushed by an enemy,
but yet it will not break his head. And what great consola∣tion
is this, it is not terrour of conscience that can separate
a man from Christ: Nay I may speake a greater thing then
that, it is not the power of your corruptions that can break
your head, though they will make you go more lamely and
heavily, yet pride and passions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do not separate union.
It must therefore raise up the heart of a Christian above his
temptations, above corruptions, above the world, above
all the enemies of his soule, what can they all doe? If the
Lord be with us, who can be against us? <HI>He that delivered up
his owne sonne to death for us, how shall he not with him freely give
us all things?</HI> Rom. 8. 31, 32. So that wee are freed from all
annoyance from the curse of the Law, the rigour of the law,
free from desertion and corruption, and the Lord hath gi∣ven
us himselfe, and his Son, and his Spirit, and his C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve∣nant,
and Kingdome, and his Church and people, and Or∣dinance,
and all is yours, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 22, 23. And how comes
all to be ours? By the blood of the Lamb that hath purcha∣sed
all good things, and the removall of all evill, therefore
how comfortable may the soules of Gods people be, if they
did attend to the blood of the Lamb.</P>
<P>And therefore let not those that have any part and portion
in the blood of Christ Jesus be discouraged; let them in Gods
<PB N="187" REF="98"/>
feare meditate more of this blood, and of the power and ver∣tue
of it: As you desire your lives may be more comfortable
and serviceable to God and man, and your death more
peaceable, so be much in meditation of this blood: And if
you be doubtfull of your spirituall estate, then more seri∣ously
meditate of it, who hath suffered, and what, and for
what end he layd downe his life, and lay all together, and
see if all will not amount at length to the begetting of Faith
where it is wanting, and to the reviving of it where it is, that
we may live fruitfully, and holily, and dye comfortably.</P>

<BIBL>Rev. 13. 8. latter part of the vers.</BIBL>
<Q>The Lamb slaine from the foundation of the
world.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HERE is something yet to be handled in this Verse,
and that is the antiquity of the sufferings of Christ.
He doth not only say that Christ was a Lamb, and
slaughtered, but his death is described by the anti∣quity
of it, <HI>From the beginning of the world:</HI> Or as it is here
translated (and very fitly) <HI>from the foundation of the world;</HI>
though I would not put any great weight in the very nick of
the foundation, for the foundation of the world was laid the
first day of the creation, when the Lord made the highest hea∣vens,
and the lowest earth: the highest heaven, the kingdom
of the blessed Saints and Angels, of whom it is said, <HI>Come yee
blessed of my Father inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the
beginning of the world:</HI> There was a kingdome in the founda∣tion
of the world, and therefore the Angels were created the
first day: and it is true Christ was slaine even then also, else
those Angels had not been in that kingdome: But whether
you take it for the foundation in the creation, or in the nick
of the creation, it is not greatly material, for the death
of Christ reached both to the fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and in some re∣spect
before it, and the explication of that will shew the truth
thereof, and I would not be exquisite nor curious in opening
of it.</P>
<P>The Note is this.</P>
<P>The slaughter of Christ was from the foundation of the world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>So it is said here, <HI>The Lamb</HI> (that is Christ, <HI>The Lamb of
God) slaine from the foundation of the world:</HI> the Lamb is
Christ, evident it is that in fulnesse of time he was slaughtered
<PB N="189" REF="99"/>
about 4000. years after the world was made, but yet the holy
Ghost saith, <HI>He was slaine from the foundation of the world;</HI> so
that though it was actually accomplished and performed in
fulnesse of time, yet as time began, the suffering of Christ be∣gan
also; slaine he was therefore <HI>from the foundation of the
world.</HI></P>
<P>First, In respect of Gods eternall purpose, who from the
foundation of the world, and before the foundation of the
world appointed Christ to this slaughter. <HI>We are redeemed,</HI>
(saith <HI>Peter) not with silver and gold, but with the precious blood
of Christ as of a Lamb without spot, who verily was fore-ordayned be∣fore
the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times,</HI>
&amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19, 20. Before the foundation of the world,
and from the foundation of the world, many times in Scrip∣ture
are both one in meaning; before the foundation of the
world he was ordained to be slaughtered, the Apostles words
are expre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly so, as of a lamb slaine he was ordained, and from
the foundation of the world implyes long before the time he
was slaughtered, and then you know not where to put the
period, but some reference it hath to the foundation of the
world.</P>
<P>Secondly, He is truly said to be slaughtered from the foun∣dation
of the world, in regard of the promise of God made
to <HI>Adam</HI> since the world began; the same day that <HI>Adam</HI> was
created he fell, or certainly soon after, but most probable
the same day: the same day that he fell, it is clear the Lord
gave him a promise of the death of Christ, in <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 15. for
that is the meaning of the promise: <HI>He shall break thine head,</HI>
speaking to the Serpent, he shall crush the head of the Serpent:
<HI>For the seed of the woman shall break the Serpents head; Thou shalt
bruise his heel.</HI> Heel implyes the humanity of Christ, which
was to be tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n upon, and indeed it was all that the tempter
could doe, but that bruising the heel was the crushing of his
humanity, his soul and body was rent asunder, that was pro∣mised
from the foundation of the world.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>From the foundation of the world,</HI> Christ was slaine
in the foreruning types of him; for it is said, <HI>that Abel brought
of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof,</HI> and that was a
<PB N="190" REF="100"/>
type of this Lamb, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 4. the sacrifice of <HI>Abel</HI> was a type
of Christ suffering: now because offering that sacrifice was
by faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 4. And faith hath ground from the word
of God, though there was no written word, yet there was
from the mouth of God to <HI>Adam,</HI> that taught <HI>Adam,</HI> he and his
sonnes to offer sacrifice in type of Christ that was to be slain,
who should break the head of the Serpent, and therefore as a
type of the bruising of the heel of the promised seed which
God had set before them, they were to offer sacrifice, to sha∣dow
forth that great worke of Christ: <HI>Abel</HI> beleived on
Christ, how far expresly or distinctly I do not know; but
had he not beleived, he had not sacrificed by faith, nor had
not been accepted.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>He was slaine from the foundation of the world,</HI> in
regard of the virtue and efficacy of his death: from thence,
the lively virtue and efficacy of the death of Christ did express
it selfe from the very foundation of the world, that <HI>Abel did
offer a more acceptable sacrifice then Cain,</HI> it was from his faith;
what was his faith fastened on, by which his sacrifice was ac∣cepted?
(for it is said, <HI>the Lord had respect to him, and to his offe∣ring)</HI>
it is Christ alone, it implyes he looked not for accep∣tance
by his sacrifice; it is impossible that the blood of buls
should take away sinne, but he looked to be accepted in Christ
Jesus: so <HI>Enoch</HI> is said to have walked with God, <HI>Gen</HI> 5. 24.
and no man can walke with God except he be reconciled with
God, <HI>Amos</HI> 3 3. And is there any reconciliation but in the
blood of the Sonne of God? <HI>We are reconciled to God by the
death of his Sonne,</HI> Rom. 5. 10. It is said of <HI>Abraham,</HI> that <HI>by
faith he left his country and his fathers house, and his kindred, and
went out, not knowing whether he went, Heb. 11. 8. Gen.</HI> 12. 1.
How comes <HI>Abraham</HI> to be redeemed and rescued from the
blood of his Ancestors and from his fathers house? <HI>We are
redeemed from our vaine conversation received by tradition from our
fathers, not with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ,
as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, 1 Pet.</HI> 1. 18, 19.
Which argues plainly and evidently that <HI>Abraham</HI> himself, if
he had not been washed in the blood of this Lamb, he could
not have been saved from hankering after the blood of his
<PB N="191" REF="100"/>
Ancestors; if the blood of Ancestors had been more warme
in him then the blood of Christ, he would not have been re∣deemed
from his fathers house: but now in his old age he
leaves his country and goes to seek that seed in whom they
all should be blessed in that country. It is said in <HI>Gen.</HI> 15. 6.
That <HI>he beleived in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righ∣teousnesse:
and all justiffication is by faith</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>in
the blood of Christ,</HI> Rom. 3. 23, 24, 25. <HI>We all have sinned,
and are deprived of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, &amp;c.</HI> For all the
sinnes that have passed us from the beginning of the world,
the Lord received atonement for them in the blood of his
sonne: and our father <HI>Abraham,</HI> if he were justified, <HI>it was by
faith in the sonne of God.</HI> How came it to passe that <HI>Joseph</HI> was
able to overcome the strong and subtile temptations of his
Mistresse, in <HI>Gen. 39. 9. How shall I do this great wickednesse,
and sinne against God?</HI> Can he mortifie a lust by any power of
his own? No, let the Apostle answer it, in <HI>Gal. 5. 29. They
that are Christs have crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts;</HI>
for so it is, it is not affections, but all the sinful passions that
hang about the soules of men, the Lord frees us from them
all by the blood of his Sonne: So that if you see <HI>Joseph</HI> cru∣cified
to his lust, and <HI>Abraham</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from his fathers house
and justified; if you see <HI>Abel</HI> offering a more acceptable sacri∣fice
then <HI>Cain:</HI> Look at all these as lively fruits of the blood
of the Lamb slaine from the beginning of the world, whence
also springs their faith? heavenly mindednesse, their sancti∣fication?
their power of godlinesse was as great (and in ma∣ny
things greater) as in those that have lived since his cruci∣fying
on the crosse.</P>
<P>Now if it had not been as effectuall and reall before his
coming, as when he did come, doubtlesse the efficacy of his
death would have been lesse powerfull and more weak in
them that lived before his coming; but when you see such
livelinesse spring from the virtue and power of it, then you
see the efficacy of it from the foundation of the world, onely
the manifestation of it was not so clear as afterwards, whence
it comes to passe that the generality of Christians now are,
<PB N="192" REF="101"/>
or ought to be, more cleare and more pure then the generali∣ty
of Christians then; but in some men, you have had them
that exceeded those that lived in Christs owne time, and
since.</P>
<P>5. There is a fifth respect in which Christ is said to be
slaine from the beginning of the world, and that is in
respect of the faith of Gods elect who lived from the begin∣ning
of the world: As soon as there was a man on the earth,
the same day the Lord put emnity between the seed of the
woman and the Serpent; now the seed of the woman looks
for salvation in the seed of the woman, and they did even
then look to the Lord Jesus the <HI>Messias</HI> as much as we do since
in <HI>John 8. 56. Your father Abraham rejoyced to see my day, he
saw it and was glad:</HI> that was the day of the coming of Christ
into the world to be an attonement for the sinnes of his peo∣ple:
If <HI>Abraham</HI> saw it, then <HI>Enoch, Noah, Abel,</HI> and <HI>Adam,</HI>
and <HI>Eve;</HI> and who ever lived by Jesus Christ, they all saw
Christ afar off, yet they saw him notwithstanding, they saw
his day, the day of his Incarnation, and Passion, and Resur∣rection:
and it is said in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 1. That <HI>faith is the subsi∣stence
of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seene;</HI> that
is, it did give the Fathers before Christ, as clearly to see Christ
already present to them, as if he had been actually come in
the flesh, and so it is with all the Saints at this day; look as
we do, as really believe the Resurrection of the body, that by
faith gives it substance as verily as if it were present, and as
we believe the salvation of our soules, as verily as if it were
accomplished; and it is as clear, I meane, as certaine as if it
were already done, and in some measure as evident; for so he
saith, <HI>It is the evidence of things not seen;</HI> he speaks in the Apostle
words, <HI>The confidence and evidence of things not seen.</HI> Hence it
comes, <HI>That the fathers saw the promises &amp; embraced them, but did
not receive them,</HI> Heb. 11. 39. That is, did not receive them ac∣complished
(for they never saw Christ in his death) but
they were perswaded of them, and embraced them, and did
verily look for them in expectation, as if they had been pre∣sent
with them; that is, if Christ had been come, they would
not have done nor suffered more then they did; which argues
<PB N="193" REF="101"/>
that faith gives a basis and subsistence to what it layes hold
on; and makes it so reall, that we shall neither do more, nor
suffer more, if it were present; They did believe that the time
would come, when the <HI>Messias</HI> being bruised himselfe, he
would break the Serpents head.</P>
<P><HI>These are the severall respects in which Christ is said to be
the Lamb slaine from the foundation of the world;</HI> In regard
of the purpose of God, in regard of his promise, in regard of the
types of him, in the Sacrifices that were shadowes of Christ, and
did really hold him forth; in regard of the vertue of it, and in re∣gard
of the faith of Gods people that lived from the beginning of the
world; in regard of all these Christ was slaine from the beginning of
the world,</P>
<P>For the Reasons of the point;</P>
<P>All the ways and respects I have spoken to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> are as so many
Reasons; yet if a man should stand upon a Reason, I would
first say this; the first may be from the eternity of that which
is infinite; what ever is infinite, is eternall: Now the value
and vertue of the death of Christ is infinite, as <HI>being the blood
of the sonne of God,</HI> Acts 20. 28. Now that which is infinite,
as well reacheth that which is before, as after it; infinite it is,
or else it cannot be eternall: and infinite it had need to be,
or else the infinite wrath of God could not be satisfied there∣by;
but being infinite, it was of eternall efficacy, and there∣fore
he was a Lamb slain, and <HI>slaine from the foundation of the
world:</HI> So that all that are elect were in Christ before the
foundation of the world. <HI>Ephes. 1. 4. Hee hath chosen us in
Christ before the foundation of the world;</HI> in Christ, and in Christ
crucified before the foundation of the world; for being of in∣finite
value, it must of necessity be eternall; there is nothing
infinite, but is eternall, they are co-incident; that which is
finite will end, it began in time, and will end in time: But
that which is infinite must needs have respect to eternity;
and therefore saith our Saviour, <HI>John 8. 38. Before Abraham
was I am:</HI> So that take him whether as God, or in point of
the vertue and efficacy of his mediation, he was before <HI>Abra∣ham;</HI>
it could not be eternall, if it be not infinite; and if it be
infinite, it must needs be eternall.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="102"/>
From the presence of all future things to Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> I speak
in proper speech, it is truly said, there is nothing future to
Christ: I confesse the point is unconceivable to finite capaci∣ties,
but to God all things to come are present, as if they
were in actuall being: <HI>All things are naked and open unto the
eyes of him with whom we have to doe,</HI> Heb. 4. 13. It is an anci∣ent
speech, Eternity is like a circumference about a Center
that compasseth it round about, that if you fit on the Center,
you see all the lines: Suppose a great tower as high as the
clouds, and one sitting thereupon, he sees one man coming
this way, and another another way, he sees they will meet
in one place; they know nothing of it, it is future to them,
but present to him: So the Lord that sits upon the clouds of
eternity (if I may use such a word) he sees all things as if
they were present to him: and certaine it is, God is not one
day older then he was from the beginning; the Angels are
older, and Satan, but God is not older, nor is capable of
being older; time addes nothing to him, his eternity swal∣lows
up all; that which hath been, is, and shall be, it is fresh
still to him; that which is past, and that which is to come,
whence it is said, <HI>Before Abraham was I am,</HI> he doth not say I
was; but his past time is not lost to him, no time is past with
God; <HI>Before Abraham was I am: a thousand yeares are but as ye∣sterday;</HI>
when it is past, all are one time to God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. 4.
So then, if you look at Gods account of things that hath en∣tred
into such a Covenant from eternity, hath written so
many in the book of life to be brought on to God by the
death, and resurrection, and ascention of Christ, he knew the
person of the God-head would certainly take the humane
nature of Christ; it was present to him, and therefore hee
doth so elect, and govern, and dispose of creatures as he that
had received a ransome before the world began: And there∣fore
<HI>Elihu</HI> his speech is weighty, in <HI>Job</HI> 33. 23. That <HI>if an in∣terpreter,
one of a thousand come to a sicke man, and shew to a man
his righteousnesse, and that then God is gracious to him,</HI> and saith,
<HI>deliver him, for I have found a ransome</HI> (to wit, in the blood of
the Lamb) then will he say, <HI>deliver him:</HI> What, had he recei∣ved
a ransome in <HI>Jobs</HI> time? <HI>Job</HI> lived before <HI>Abraham?</HI> truly
<PB N="195" REF="102"/>
then he hath a ransome, as a man hath a bond from a good
surety: but so it was in his apprehension, not only because
Christ was a good surety, and would make good payment
in time, but the thing was as present with God, and really
performed; All times with God are but as now, past, pre∣sent,
and to come; all times with God are one and the same,
<HI>Jesus Christ yesterday, and to day, and for ever;</HI> Yesterday before
the Law, and to day, both under the Law, and especially
under the Gospel, and for ever the same, of the same vertue
and efficacy, and power: So you see the truth of the Point.</P>
<P>The use is shortly thus much.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> it shews you the dangerous and damnable estate of
the world from the foundation of the world; the deep de∣pravation
and corruption of the world from the foundation
of it; it is said by <HI>John,</HI> 1 John 5. 19. <HI>We know we are of God,
and all the world lyes in wickednesse:</HI> Did it lye so in <HI>Johns</HI> time,
when all the great Nations of the world worshipped the De∣vill,
<HI>Apollo, Hercules,</HI> and <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and such dunghill gods?
Did it not then lye in wickednesse? Truly it was so since the
world began, it was never better from <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI>
from <HI>Moses</HI> to Christs time, and from Christs time to this,
the whole world lyes in wickednesse; for otherwise to what
end should Christ be slain from the foundation of the world,
if there were no need of a Redeemer, else there had been no
need of his sacrificing from the foundation of the world
There were all errors in the world, not as God made it, but
they suddenly corrupted themselves. <HI>Man being in honour
abideth not, but is like the beast that perisheth,</HI> Psal. 49. 20.
The word in the Original is, <HI>he shall not sleep in it, nor lodg in it,</HI>
meaning that hee shall not take one nights rest, but become
like a beast, and clad with the skin of a beast: So this is the
condition of civill men that are like bruit beasts from the
foundation of the world: <HI>The Lord looked down from heaven,
and beheld the children of men:</HI> And the Apostle interprets it of
all men; <HI>He looked downe and beheld all the children of men, to see
if there were any that did understand and seeke God: They are all
gone aside, they are all become filthy, &amp;c.</HI> Psal. 14. 2, 3, 4, 5.
This is the case of all men by nature. The Apostle expounds
<PB N="196" REF="103"/>
it of all, <HI>Jewes</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> by nature, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 10. to 16.
And in <HI>Gen. 6. 5. The Lord looked upon the earth, and beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld it
was corrupt.</HI> And in <HI>Gen. 11. v. 12. The earth also was corrupt
before God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And God saw that all the imaginations of mans
heart were evill, onely evill, and that continually.</HI> The word
translated, <HI>Imaginations,</HI> in the Originall is, <HI>The frame and
bent of his thoughts is evill, and onely evill, and that continually;</HI>
bent to back-sliding from God, not a good thought in any
mans heart since the world began; take him as hee is by na∣ture,
not a good thought riseth in any mans heart, not a
good word from his lips, nor a good action from his hands;
Take him without the vertue of Christ since the world be∣gan,
there never rose a good thought in all mens hearts; if
there did, it was by the vertue of this Lamb of God that was
slaine from the foundation of the world. <HI>The heart of man,
(Jeremiah</HI> complained long before Christs time) <HI>is deceitfull
above measure, and desperately wicked, who can know it,</HI> Jer. 17.
9▪ <HI>Who can know the bottomlesse depth of it.</HI> This is the very
state of all the world since the world began; the whole frame
and state of the world is enmity against God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8▪ 7. It is
not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, and
that in such a deep measure, you may see by the medicine that
the Lord prepares for it; it shews the depth of the depravation
of the world from the beginning, it hath been corrupt and
incurable, unlesse it were by the vertue of the death of Christ,
by the sonne of God made man, taking upon him mans na∣ture;
and the greatnesse and infinitenesse of the vertue of this
remedie doth evidently argue the bottomlesse depth of the
corruption of the world since the world began: No man
would bespeak a Smiths great hammer to break an egg-shell,
a man would think it a marvellous vanity if he should. Tru∣ly
the Lord hath prepared the strongest iron hammer to break
the Serpents head; and which is wonderfull, this iron ham∣mer,
the Lord Jesus, that breaks all before it; The stone cut
out of the mountaine, that breaks the iron mountaine of
<HI>Rome,</HI> Dan. 2. 34. It is the same it was: it makes men many
times wonder how they came to be well conceited of the old
Religion, when Antichrist re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gned; then were golden dayes
<PB N="197" REF="103"/>
(as they say) then there was nothing, but every man regarded
other mens good as their own; precious golden seasons in
the old world, then an easie matter would have perswaded
them all: but to what end was Christ slain from the begin∣ning
of the world, if it were not full of wickednesse? if it
were not so tough that this hammer of hammers must come
to break it in pieces? If men were so tractable, children to
Parents, servants to Masters, and yoke-fellows so abundantly
in sweetnesse and amiablenesse, what needed Christ to be
crushed in pieces? <HI>Say not,</HI> saith <HI>Solomon,</HI> Eccles. 7. 10. <HI>what
is the cause that the former dayes were better then these, for thou
dost not enquire wisely concerning this:</HI> It is not a wise question;
for the truth is, thou art deceived to think the elder times
were better; it is true, it is possible men by the policy of Sa∣tan
may grow worse; But take them at the best, had there
not been a Lamb slain to rescue the same from the corruption
of it, no flesh had been saved. It is true, in some ages, when
the Gospel found free passage, there was some difference. It
was so in <HI>Davids</HI> time, better then in <HI>Sauls</HI> and <HI>Solomons,</HI> for
a time better then in <HI>Davids;</HI> and so in <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> time, bet∣ter
then in <HI>Zedekiah's,</HI> and so it hath been up and down: but
take it the best, all flesh have corrupted their wayes, there is
not a good thought, not a good word, nor a good practice
since the world began. Sometimes in morall vertues men
have more exceeded, when the Devill knew they were farre
off from spiritual grace; he tempted them not when he knew
he had them fast in a golden and silken chaine, or cord of
morall vertues (so I may call them) he led the prisoners
of those dayes in a golden chaine. The strong man armed
kept the house all the time of the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Monar∣chy
long before Christ: and if any were delivered, it was by
the death of Christ as well as now. It is true, we read in an∣cient
Poets, I think it was fetched out of <HI>Daniel</HI> from <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzars</HI>
dreame; there was a golden world, and then a
silver world, and then a brasse, and sometimes iron, there
was all. The <HI>Babylonian</HI> Monarch was gold: but when it
was gold, it was but golden fetters of sinne, and a land of
wickednesse that held men close to the Devill; and the silver
<PB N="198" REF="104"/>
Monarch of <HI>Persia</HI> was but silver fetters; and the brasse Mo∣narch
of <HI>Greece</HI> it was but brazen fetters.</P>
<P>It is true, when Religion brake forth, then hee put upon
them more chaines, strong beastly lusts, <HI>men with men com∣mitting
filthinesse,</HI> Rom. 1. 17. These were iron chains to ca∣ry
men captive to Satan: He sees Learning break forth, and
therefore he layes stronger chains and bands upon them: <HI>Be
no more stiffe-necked, lest your bands encrease, saith the Lord:</HI> and
so from golden bands you have silver, and from silver, brasse,
and from brasse, iron, and all to lead you captive to your
last execution: And what is the difference? if a man be py∣nion'd
with a golden cord, or a silver, or a brazen and iron
cord, the one is more glittering then the other, but all
bring to destruction: Therefore look at all the world living
in wickednesse since the world began, or else in vain was
the Lamb slain: The very frame of mans transgression brought
in a necessity of a like remedy, and therefore a like need of the
blood of Christ.</P>
<P>And it is a vain Question, as <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, why the former
times should be better then these: so it is a vain apprehensi∣on
that men have of themselves as good, to say, I thank God
I have a good heart, and you shall finde me tractable, and rea∣sonable,
(though they be but naturall) and so their children
are very tractable, you may lead them with a twinde theerd,
and need not use violence, you may soon break them; what
then are you but eggshels? what need then a iron hammer to
crush all the power of the enemy? do not you and your chil∣dren
stand in need of the virtue of the blood of the Lamb as
much as others have since the world began? That men have
stood in need of the blood of the Lamb from the foundation
of the world to rescue them from the power of the strong man,
if they were so tractable, young or old? I know there is a
great difference between spirits. God forbid we should de∣fame
the work of God in nature, but take the best spirit, there
is unconceivable enmity in the best natur'd man against Christ;
there is an in-bred emnity against him ever since the world be∣gan,
as is impossible to be healed, but by the blood of Christ;
Christ came to crush them whiles they are in the shell, and
<PB N="199" REF="104"/>
unlesse he heal them, verily children of a span long cannot
be saved: Therefore let no man flatter themselves in their
good inclination; there is that in us since the world began,
that Christ must be broken and crushed to break the league be∣tween
us and the Devill: Christ himselfe in his soule and bo∣dy
must be striken, he kils himselfe by the stroke he gives to
the enemy.</P>
<P>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, and it is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
goodnesse of nature, or what ever else you can talke of, that
will root it out; nor the rod of correction, unlesse the blood
of the Lamb be sprinkled upon it, and then it may be of great
use, and any other ordinance to bring them to the wayes of
Christ Jesus. Now if this were well stamped and revetted
into the spirits of men, it would humble proud flesh, and not
onely take them off from the free will of Popery, and Armi∣nianisme,
and a pack of such; but I hope there is lesse need of
speaking against such heresies, but to set it home upon our
own hearts; whatever our fathers have been, we their chil∣dren
are not better: Some accidentall difference there may
be, but setting aside such accidentall differences for the sub∣stance
of prevailing corruptions, they have ruled and reigned
in the hearts of men, since the world began, by invincible
power unable to be subdued, but onely by the blood of the
Lamb: And therefore you that are children of godly Pa∣rents,
hear this word and know it; you bring such engage∣ments
into the world with you to the strong man, and now
are so engaged, that unlesse Christ be broken for you, and his
death suffered for you, and his blood shed for you; you see
how it is with younger and elder people, and let all Parents
tell it to their children, and Masters to their servants, and all
that have to do with the world; be not deluded with a good
affection to your own nature you are in, this is the state of all
since the world began; they are all sprauling in wickednesse,
and there is such a league between the Devil and them, that
unlesse the Lamb be slaughtered, we cannot be saved.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> Let all the sonnes of nature, and all other sons
of grace, know, that if Christ was slaughtered from the be∣ginning
of the world, and onely to break the Serpents head,
<PB N="200" REF="105"/>
which had plotted our destruction from the foundation of
the world, then certainly it is not possible we should live in
those sinnes by which we have slaughtered Christ; can any
man that knows the difference between the right hand and
left, commit sinne that slaughters Christ Jesus, and live and
die in it well enough? and think with himselfe, that not∣withstanding
the lewd lusts that hurry me, I shall do well e∣nough
with it? an oath is not such a great matter, or to sit
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ippling till we be drunk, or gaining too much in bargains,
it is no such great matter: I tell thee, if it be breach of the
law of God, thou canst not live in it; Christ himselfe could
not, it cost his breaking.</P>
<P>I speak nothing to the difference between mortall and ve∣niall
sins; was it a veniall sin, think ye, that slaughtered
the Son of God? they have been breaking him since the
world began; and is it possible that if he lye a bleeding for sin,
is it possible that this or that sinne should be veniall and ought
to be passed over? be not deceived, look what slaughter it
hath brought of the chiefest of the world, even the God of
the world, it slaughtered him; and there are none of all his
people that shall be saved by him, but must be slaughtered in
his lusts and passions, they must be crucified with Christ, if they
have any part in him; he was slaine from the beginning, and
so from first to last, they must be crucified from the power of
sinne, or else they cannot be saved. And therefore let no
man blesse himself, and think he shall do well enough though
he continue in sin; for the truth is, there is no sin but cost
Christs breaking and crushing, and either thou must lay hold
on his death, and be conformable unto him, or else thou shalt
never have part in him; it is tough work to slaughter sin; let
this slaughter of Christ cut off all out-runnings of sinne, whe∣ther
in thoughts, words, and deeds; let it be as a slaughte∣ring
knife to all our lusts, considering there is no taking
leave in this and that; for the truth is, it cost the very blood
of Christ.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> It may teach us the unity of our Religion with
the Religion of the ancient Patriarks since the world began;
how did they look to be saved? In <HI>Acts</HI> 15. 11. they all loo∣ked
<PB N="201" REF="105"/>
to be saved by grace, and by the blood of the Lord Jesus,
as we doe in doing and suffering all for them, and we know
no other way: There is no name under heaven whereby wee
must be saved, but onely the name of Christ, and by that we
are saved from the guilt and filth of sinne, and supplyed with
grace to conform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us to Christ Jesus, and to make us like to
him our head and husband; there is the old way of salvation,
and it is the same now; there is unity and true antiquity.
The Papists speak much of antiquities, but let them bring no
other way of salvation but the blood of the Lamb, and we
will look at them as Churches for point of salvation; we
will grant them the right hand of fellowship if they will look
for no salvation neither from free will, nor from merits of
their own, nor from the intercession of Saints and Angells,
nor from dispensations of the Pope, nor from the going on
pilgrimage, nor from the satisfaction of Saints, but that they
look for salvation onely from the blood of the Lamb; truly
we will give them the right hand of fellowship; let them
have errours, there may be many errours otherwise: but let
them hold there, and look for all salvation there, and rest not
upon any other hopes of salvation, but what they receive
from the blood of the Lamb by faith in him (for so alone it
is received) faith in the blood of the Lamb, breeds and sheds
abroad every grace in some measure and makes fruitfull. <HI>No
man hath washed his roabs in the blood of the Lamb, but is fit to walk
with Christ in white to justification to his sanctification, Rev.</HI> 7. 14.
And so you shall have a true and perfect agreement in Religi∣on,
if that we agreed upon looking there for salvation, and
put not salvation else-where: but when men magnifie na∣ture,
and pinch upon, and extenuate the blood of Christ, and
in their deep devotion you shall have pictured, here is the
blood of Christ, and the blood of the sonne of the Virgin;
when he looks upon the sonne of the Virgin, he thinks there
is perfect salvation; but when he looks upon other things, to
the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of his mother; oh there is more sweetnesse in milk
then in blood! when he looks againe to the passion of Christ,
then he priseth that; but when he looks to the tendernesse of
his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her, hee thinkes there is more in that: And thus
<PB N="202" REF="106"/>
doth their blasphemous devotion hang between the milk of
the mother, and the blood of the Lamb, which argues their re∣ligion
is transported to a notion of the blood of the Lamb,
and they are captive hither and thither, and any whether, ra∣ther
then to the blood of Christ.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> It may be of instruction to us, that never any
evill can befall us, but there is a remedy prepared before it
come upon us: <HI>The Lamb was slaine from the beginning of the
world.</HI></P>
<P>Though we lived before Christs time, and much more, if
after it: there is no sinne that <HI>Adam</HI> nor his wife committed,
but there was a remedy prepared for it before the foundation
of the world; it was of infinite value, it was provided from
eternity, and promised from the foundation of the world;
it was shadowed in types, and exhibited in sundry represen∣tations,
and in the lively efficacy of it in the hearts and lives
of his people since the world began: All that we read of <HI>No∣ah,
Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> of Kings,
Priests, and Prophets, and Apostles, what have they all been,
but lively representations and foot-steps of the power of the
blood of the Lamb: the Lord provided his slaughter of the
Lamb, for the redemption of all his people, out of the world,
before the world began.</P>
<P>It is many a conceit that Christians have; this and that
might have fallen out better, if such means had been taken in
time, such a mans life had been saved; according as <HI>Martha</HI>
said unto our blessed Saviour in <HI>John 11. 21. Lord if thou hadst
been here, my brother had not dyed;</HI> why so? Christ had been a∣ble
to heal him; By what virtue shall he raise a man from
death to life? Is it not by the virtue of his death and resur∣rection?
If it be, was not his death and resurrection before
the world began? For it is of infinite value; and therefore
though he came four dayes after <HI>Lazarus</HI> death was past, yet
he came timely enough, for he brought virtue with him; and
so let no man say, if I had known as much now as before, I
should not have done thus: By what virtue should you have
been preserved? if there be any saving benefit, it must be by
the blood of the Lamb, for it is from that, that we look for
<PB N="203" REF="106"/>
all our redemption from all afflictions and temptations from
his blood, then there was remedy enough before, but it was
not applyed, because God hath some other work more hea∣venly
and spirituall and usefull to us then the accomplish∣ment
of our hearts desire, then the repairing of our losses and
crosses.</P>
<P>So then this is of speciall use to us, that if his blood be shed
from the founda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the world, then the remedy is never
too late: If we thinke if we had not known many things, we
might have saved a world of sorrow: why did we not? was
it because there was no balm in <HI>Gilead,</HI> or no vettue in the
blood of the Lamb, or that the vertue of it is dryed up? No,
God forbid; but the Lord hath some other exercise for us to
make us conformable to Christ, he would have us more
weaned from the world, and more Christ-like, and more
Lamb-like; more spirituall, and every way more conforma∣ble
to Christ, and for that his blood was sufficient, for he
came not to save us from crosses, but from curses from any
thing that might hurt our soules, as might break our heads,
as might hurt our union with Christ, and communion with
his spirit, for that it may be of value; it was of value 4000.
yeares before his coming in the flesh; and do you think it is
not of value 4000. yeares after? it is not yet 2000. yeares
since his coming, but 1600. and some odde: then be per∣swaded
that the blood of Christ is still lively and fresh to re∣move
all sinne and crosses, and to leave a gracious Tincture
on all crosses, to do us more good then if we were without
them; This is the efficacy of this blood which is a stay to
Christians that are troubled with the power of their corrup∣tions
and temptations, they are not able to overcome and
resist such temptations; why not able? If all the powers of
hell come against you, verily there was a remedy provided
long ago, and it was abundantly efficacious foure thousand
yeares before, and it is of more efficacy now, though they
had the Gospel before, yet not in that clear manifestation:
and therefore if you read that <HI>Abraham</HI> sacrificed, and he plea∣sed
God; but I doubt my prayers and my prophecying<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
please not God; why do they not? <HI>Abraham</HI> knew of the
<PB N="204" REF="107"/>
meanes whereby he should please God. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> walked with
God,</HI> but I shall never keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch fellowship with him; he was
reconciled to God, and there was no meanes of reconcilia∣tion
but by the blood of the Lamb, it is able to put strength
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> faith. <HI>Abraham</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Countrey and his
Fathers he use, onely because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> blood of the
Lamb: and if he prevailed so far, why not we? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f he was ful∣ly
satisfied in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by believing him that
had promised, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it that his death i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not of infinite
value <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as well as before? If <HI>Joseph</HI> was able to withstand
his wanton <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, doubtless there is the like power now;
how shall I crucifie the Sonne of God, and put him to open
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>? Thus poor Christians work upon this infinite vertue,
and lively power of the death of Christ; it wonde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fully
calmes and purifies the heart, it mightily strengthens against
all corruption: and what ever riseth in the hearts of Gods
people that prevailes against them, it is because the blood of
the Lamb is not applyed, otherwise it could not be they
should be dead-hearted and blind-spirited, and many times
at a losse in this and that practice, and wrestling with this
and that temptation, it springs only from want of applying
the efficacy of this blood which hath been of such infinite ver∣tue
from the beginning of the world.</P>

<BIBL>Rev. 13. 9, 10.</BIBL>
<Q><P>If any man have an eare let him heare.</P>
<P>He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: Hee
that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword,
here is the patience and the faith of the Saints.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F any man have an eare, let him heare:</HI> What should
he heare? For when he doth often use this phrase
in the second and third Chapter, he tells you
what they shall heare: <HI>Heare what the Spirit saith
unto the Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Now he doth not put in that object of hearing; but yet ta∣king
his meaning, he meanes that which the Spirit hath sayd
unto you in the former description of the Beast, especially
that which he said to them in the words before going, to wit,
the universality of the worshippers of the Beast, and the cer∣tain
destruction of those that do worship him, and the preser∣vation
of the elect children of God from that contagion.</P>
<P>It is meet to be heard that such a Beast would come into
the world as the Roman visible Church, and that he hath in
him the resemblance of all the old Empires, of the Lyon of
<HI>Babell,</HI> of the Beare of <HI>Persia,</HI> of the Leopard of <HI>Greece,</HI> and
of other Beasts, and of that other Beast the old Roman Pa∣gan
Empire: And it is not unworthy to be heard, the wound
that should be given gim by the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandalls,</HI> and the
time of his greatnesse, and that those that worship him shall
not be saved, only Reprobates shall worship him: And <HI>those
whose names are written in the booke of life,</HI> they shall either
not be worshippers of him, (but beare witnesse against him)
or else they shall be rescued from it, and not live and dye in
that worship. So these two verses are Corolaries, or uses,
<PB N="206" REF="108"/>
which the holy Ghost makes (in the former verses) of the
description of the Beast.</P>
<P>The first is a word of attention, and due consideration to
every intelligent reader of this Prophecy: <HI>If any man have an
eare, let him heare.</HI></P>
<P>The second is a word of consolation to all the Church and
people of God, and that is double.</P>
<P>1. From the violent destruction of this great Beast, a dou∣ble
destruction.</P>
<P>1. Captivity.</P>
<P>2. Slaughter; and both amplified by the equity of both,
the Lord rendering the like vengeance unto this Beast, which
hath rendered unto the Saints: <HI>Hee that leadeth into captivity
shall goe into captivity.</HI> And againe, <HI>Hee that killeth with the
sword</HI> (as this Beast had done by his Warr, some millions of
Saints) <HI>must be killed with the sword.</HI></P>
<P>The second Consolation is a word of acknowledgment of
the Patience, and Faith of the Saints that have, or shall suffer
from this Beast: <HI>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints;</HI>
not only of the Saints acknowledged as Sufferers in the time
of the Pagan, Roman Empire, but even such as suffer under
his Holinesse (as they call it) and that suffer under this Ca∣tholick
visible Church: These sufferings are here acknow∣ledged
for witnesse bearing, against the Heresies, Idolatries,
and Tyrannies of that State. The Lord doth acknowledge
their Sufferings to be the patience and faith of the Saints: As
he did acknowledg it when the Saints were put to death in
the tenne Persecutions, so likewise doth he acknowledge
these. And this is some part of the meaning of the words:
That which more concerneth it may be further opened in
handling the notes that arise from them.</P>
<Q><P>If any man have an eare to heare.]</P></Q>
<P>That is, an intelligent, understanding eare: If any man
be taught of God to hear; if any man have learned of the Fa∣ther
to heare; if any man have a spirituall understanding
(for that is the meaning of it) let him heare what God hath
sayd: For it was a great word hee said, that all the Repro∣bates
in Christendome should worship this great Beast, and
<PB N="207" REF="108"/>
none of all the Saints of God should do it. This none can
heare, but those that have eares given them to heare.</P>
<P>The note arising first from thence is this:</P>
<P>It is a point worthy of due and deep Attention and Consi∣deration,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct. 1.</NOTE> and yet such as none but intelligent Christians
(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aught of God) will or can understand; <HI>That a Roman Ca∣tholicke
by his Religion cannot goe beyond a Reprobate: and that an
elect child of God cannot live and dye a Roman Catholicke.</HI></P>
<P>This is the summe and true meaning of the words: These
two points were the sum of the former verses which the holy
Ghost had delivered with much evidence and strength; and
yet lest it should be slighted over by some carelesse Readers,
he doth therefore set it on as he is wont to do the weightiest
matters that concern a State: <HI>If any man have an eare let him
heare:</HI> If he have the eare of a Christian, that discernes the
voyce of Christ the Shepheard of his soule, let him heare it,
and mind it well, worthy it is therefore of due and deep at∣tention,
and he doth never use the phrase but in matters of
singular importance; and it doth imply, <HI>That every man hath
not an eare to heare,</HI> but only those to whom God hath gi∣ven
eares. What shall they heare? They shall heare this,
<HI>That none of all the devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Catholicks have their names written in
the Lambs booke of life,</HI> but their devout worship in the end
will leave them in no better estate then a reprobate state. If
they go no further then their Religion, it leads them to the
worship of this Catholick Church, but never leads them
further then a reprobate condition: But for such, <HI>whose
names are written in the Lambs booke,</HI> hee excepts them from
this generality of worship, they are not of this number: It
doth expresly hold forth, <HI>That a sincere hearted Christian, an
elect Christian brought home to God, and brought to fellowship with
Christ, and the fruits of his Election are expressed in his Justifica∣tion,
and Sanctification, he cannot live and dye a Roman Catholick.</HI>
He may for a time worship the Beast in his ignorance, and
do as the rest of the world do, and shew no difference be∣tween
himselfe and the rest of the world: but when this ele∣cting
love of God doth shed it selfe abroad into his heart, it
doth make him see the counsell of God more; and it doth
<PB N="208" REF="109"/>
discover the delosions of the man of Sinne, that he cannot,
nor dare not worship him: He seeth that God requires more
to Salvation, then the subjection unto the injunctions of this
Beast of <HI>Rome.</HI> And this is the point which the Holy Ghost
tells you as of so great, and necessary, and due attention
and censideration, which none but understanding eares can
or will understand, but all the world will run admiring af∣ter
the Beast.</P>
<P>The Lord did foresee that Doctrine would be thought a
harsh, and peremptory, and sensorious sentence, that mor∣tall
men, and they sometimes but an handfull too, should
dare to bid defiance to the whole Catholick Church to looke
at them as Reprobates: and to look at those whom they con∣demn
for Hereticks, as the elect servants of God.</P>
<P>This the Holy Ghost did see would be accounted great ar∣rogance,
and almost scurrility, and therefore the Holy
Ghost doth put it on with a watch-word, <HI>Let him that hath an
eare heare:</HI> And he puts it on with strength, that all Chri∣stendome
should worship the Beast, and yet none should wor∣ship
him <HI>whose names were written in the Lambs booke of life.</HI></P>
<P>It might be of singular use in some places, nor here of so
much: Yet it being a part of the counsell of God, I may not
lightly passe it over, because we know not what times may
come, nor whether some of us may have occasion to travell,
it is meet therefore that Christians should know something
of it, more briefly, and plainly.</P>
<P>If you should desire any further testimony to confirm it,
consider what the Holy Ghost saith, in <HI>Rev</HI> 11. 2. where he
tels you of the Court that is without the Temple: <HI>Measure it
not</HI> (saith he) <HI>for it is given to the Gentiles and to the holy City,
they shall tread under foot forty and two moneths.</HI> Where you shall
see that he speaks of the same persons, and of the same di∣stance
of time: Hee would have a Temple of God measured,
even in the darkest times of Popery: But for the Court (al∣luding
to the outward Court of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple where a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
the people came in) do not measure that: Look at them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
not capable of measuring b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the rule of the word of God,
count them as given to the Gentiles: <HI>And the holy City shall
<PB N="209" REF="109"/>
they tread under foot forty and two moneths,</HI> the same time that
here the Beast is to rule: Now Gentiles are accounted <HI>without
Christ, and without God in the world,</HI> Ephes. 2. 12. He meanes
Pagan Gentiles, nor Christian Gentiles, for such are we.
And in <HI>Rev. 11. 8. The dead bodies of the witnesses, they shall lye
in the street of the great City;</HI> and he doth account it spiritually
<HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Aegypt: Sodome</HI> for lewednesse, and beastly lusts:
and <HI>Aegypt</HI> for barbarous and base idolatry, and oppression of
Gods people; This is the esteem the holy Ghost hath of him.</P>
<P>And in <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. 5. Hee calls her <HI>a great whore, and the
mother of harlots:</HI> And the Text is playn, and holds forth
this doctrine playnely, and the Holy Ghost would have
all the Churches of Christ to know it, <HI>That none do wor∣ship
this Roman Catholicke Church</HI> (that is, are reconciled to it,
and give up themselves to the fidelity of it) <HI>that goe beyond the
state of a Reprobate: And all the Churches of God cannot do thus,
and therefore cannot live and dye Roman Catholicks.</HI></P>
<P>Let me name you some popular reasons: I will not make
any subtile discourse of it, though it would require strong
Judgement, and sinewes of Reason: but take popular Rea∣sons,
and yet such as will bear some waite.</P>
<P>The first is from their want of Christ Jesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> in whom all
our life and salvation is laid up. <HI>He that hath not the Sonne,
hath not life;</HI> it is a plaine and peremptory principle of the
Gospell, 1 <HI>John 5. 12. No Christ, no salvation. There is no other
name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,
Acts</HI> 4. 12. Now this Roman Catholick Church, and they
that worship the same, they have not Christ: How proove
you that? For Christ is not had, nor received, but by faith
in the Gospell, in a free promise of Grace unto the soule. <HI>As
many as received him, to them gave he power, to become the sonnes of
God, even to them that bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive on his name,</HI> John 1▪ 12. <HI>Christ
dwels in our hearts by Faith, Ephes.</HI> 3. 17. The faith therefore
by which we receive Christ whether have they that faith or
no, let themselves be Judge? They do professe that the Ca∣tholick
Faith is no more but a perswasion of the truth of all
the doctrines of the Gospell, and of the whole word of God:
but for a particular application of Christ unto the soule, they
<PB N="210" REF="110"/>
do not acknowledge it as that which is the means of receiving
of Christ. So that the Faith which they do in this case hold
forth, is in very truth no other, but that which <HI>James</HI> saith of
the faith of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vils; they have received as much. <HI>James 2▪ 19.
Thou beleivest that there is one God, thou doest wed, the Devils also
beleive and tremble.</HI> A Roman Catholick beleives the whole
doctrine of the world; He does well; the Devils know as
much, and beleive as much as they do, yet no man will say
that the Devils faith receives Christ. Now where there is no
Christ, there is no salvation. Where there is no Faith, there
is no Christ: And where there is no Faith but that which
the Devils may reach unto, there is no true Faith at all.</P>
<P>It would be endlesse to run into all the objections that they
make: but let any that know Faith aright, judge whether
the Faith of theirs is such a Faith whereby a man can receive
the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> Without Grace there is no salvation. For saith
the Apostle, <HI>By Grace are ye saved through Faith, and that not of
your selves, it is the gift of God. Not of workes, least any man
should boast, Eph.</HI> 2. 8, 9. If therefore the Roman Catholickes
say that they are saved by workes, and they say so, if we take
workes in the worst tenour of workes, that is by the meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
works: The Apostle saith, <HI>Not of works, least any man should
boast,</HI> and say, <HI>that he hath wrought his own salvation,:</HI> And the
Apostle tels you, <HI>If it be of works, it is not of Grace, Rom.</HI> 11. 6.
For works cannot be joyned with grace in the merit of salva∣tion;
they are onely the way of salvation. And in that sence
it is said, <HI>Worke out your salvation with fear and trembling: For
it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good pleasure,
Phil.</HI> 2. 12, 13. But if a man look for salvation out of the
merit of works, he hath it not from grace. Papists reply,
they have it from works and grace also; for they have it
not from works of nature, but from works of grace, and they
are not opposite, but subordinate. But what saith the A∣postle?
He saith, <HI>workes and grace are not subordinate, but oppo∣site
one to another: and if it be of grace, it is not of workes: and
if of workes, then not of grace.</HI> And the Apostle tels you, <HI>Gal. 5.
4. If ye be justified by the workes of the Law, you are fallen from
<PB N="211" REF="110"/>
grace:</HI> you have no part nor portion of the grace of Christ:
And therefore they are fallen from grace; and if from Grace,
then from salvation.</P>
<P>These are principles of Religion; and he that hath any un∣derstanding
to hear what the holy Ghost saith in this case,
may easily perceive the truth of what we speak. In very
truth you will finde that all which they hold, is but in a te∣nor
of the Covenant of works. Their election they hold is
from works and faith foreseen: Some of them indeed are af∣fraid
of it, as the <HI>Dominicans;</HI> but the most prevailing are
those that think Gods electing love, is but out of faith and
works foreseen. They look as the grace of effectuall calling
to be founded upon the good inclination of a mans will, and
co-operation of it with the grace of Gods calling. They
professe that <HI>Simon Peter</HI> had no more grace given him then
<HI>Simon Magus</HI> to become a christian. And what cut the scant∣ling
between the one, and the other? <HI>Peter</HI> had received so
much grace, that if he would, he might be saved; and so they
say, <HI>Simon Magus</HI> did receive the same, but God did not bow
&amp; change his will, or reason, but left them both so far suffered,
as they might beleive if they would. How comes it then, that
<HI>Simon Peter</HI> did beleive, and was saved? and <HI>Simon Magus</HI> did
not beleive (with a lively faith) and was damned? They
will confesse it really (the body of them) that it did spring
from <HI>Peters</HI> will; he did out of the freenesse of his will choose
it. This is vocation from the working of a mans will:
whereas the Covenant of Grace doth confesse, that it is not of
our will, but of the Lords, that takes away our strong heart,
and gives us a soft heart before any preparation.</P>
<P>Justification they look for none, but by works: nor per∣severance
in a state of grace but by their works: and everla∣sting
salvation, from the merit of their works: And this is
the very doctrine of a Covenant of works. And this is all
the doctrine of the <HI>Arminians:</HI> onely they do acknowledge
justification by faith, and differ in point of Faith, and the me∣rit
of works.</P>
<P>A third Reason may be this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> The worship of creatures is
a going a whoring from God, and so of destruction unto such
<PB N="212" REF="111"/>
as go a whoring from the Lord in that way. All worship of
creatures with divine worship is called going a whoring from
God, <HI>Hos. 4. 12. They have gone a whoring from under their God:</HI>
so in <HI>Psal. 73. 27. Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring
from thee.</HI> And the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is known to go a who∣ring
after the worship of Saints, and Angels, and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages, and
thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great Beast mentioned in the Text, and the Pope the head
of it. They place their salvation in beleiving as the Catho∣lick
Church beleives: They place their salvation in recon∣cilement
to the Catholick Church▪ and are more solicitous of
it, then of reconcilement unto God by Christ. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 18, 19.
You read of some there that do not hold the head, but lay
hold upon Angels, and that is Idolatry: now that is spoken
of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> For a fourth reason of the point.</P>
<P>Without unfeigned repentance and lively faith there is no
hope of salvation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 4.</NOTE> <HI>Luke 13▪ 5. Except ye repent ye shall all like∣wise
perish. And without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb.</HI>
11. 6. Now the repentance which the Roman Catholick
Church holds forth, what is it but such as <HI>Judas</HI> did performe?
They require contrition: <HI>Judas</HI> he was deeply wounded and
broken, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27. 3. And they require confession: He came
unto them before whom he had done evill, and said, <HI>I have
sinned in betraying innocent blood.</HI> And they require satis∣faction:
He came and brought the mony, and threw it into
the Temple, and would by no means meddle with it. Here is
the repentance of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and all (for ought I
know) that they require. I finde no rule of repentance in
this Catholick Catechise, but I finde it in <HI>Judas,</HI> which will
end in despaire (which is the common end of an hypocritical
repentance) as <HI>Stephen Gardner</HI> came unto it: and so they will
do, or else dye in <HI>Nabals</HI> stoninesse.</P>
<P>And for their faith: The faith of the Elect is described to
be a confidence, and evidence, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 1. So expound <HI>Heb.</HI>
3. 14. If we hold fast the confidence, the word is all one
with subsistance, it is such a confidence as doth give a being,
and subsistance unto the thing beleived: it doth as truly
make them to be as if they were actually extent: But what
say they to this? They look at is as presumption, and an
<PB N="213" REF="111"/>
abomination: yea it will cost a man his life to hold forth such
a Faith. And for evidence, they do professe it to be incom∣patible
to a christian; and their Faith is some conjecture but
no certainty. Now gather up these things; If the Roman
Catholicks have no better Faith, no better repentance then
their Religion holds forth, if they receive Christ no other∣wise,
and worship God no better, and have no more interest
in God then their Religion leads them to; let all the world
look to it, for there is none of all the elect of God can live
and dye so.</P>
<P>But why is this a point of so serious and deep considerati∣on
and attention? that is taken</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> from the weight of the point, as most concerning
our salvation.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> it is a point that generally men are deaf to hear,
and sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to understand, and beleive: And therefore he doth
cry out, and make a solemn proclamation; <HI>If any man have an
eare to hear, let him hear.</HI> Why are they so unable and unwil∣ling
to understand? They look at it as a monstrous blas∣phemy,
to speake thus of the Roman visible Catholick
Church.</P>
<P>Then the Reason why men are so slow of heart to beleive
it, and none beleive but them which are taught of God, is
taken</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> from the spirituallnesse of the things themselves.
They are spirituall matters, and cannot be discerned but by
spiritual understanding, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 14. A naturall man doth
not discern the spiritual mysteries of iniquity, nor the spiri∣tuall
mysteries of discerning Grace; nor can they, because
they are spiritually discerned.</P>
<P>The second Reason why none but faithful intelligent chri∣stians
do understand it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taken</P>
<P>From Gods gift of Grace unto them to understand it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> <HI>To
you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdome of Heaven,
Mat.</HI> 13. 11. But being not given unto the world, the world
doth not understand it.</P>
<P>For the use of the point.</P>
<P>First it may serve to refute the damnable principle of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE>
<PB N="214" REF="112"/>
Roman Catholick Religion which is this: That for every
Nation and Kingdome to be reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>
i. is of necessity to salvation. Whoever he be that hath ears to
heare let him hear saith the holy Ghost, that to be reconciled
to the Catholick Church, and subject to that Church and the
head thereof, it is of necessity the way to damnation, if a soul so
live and so dye. For this purpose the Text is as plain as possi∣ble,
<HI>Rev. 20. 15. Whoever is not found written in the book of life
is cast into the lake of fire.</HI> This Roman Catholick Church
hath not his name written in that book of life, and there∣fore
of necessity, they must be cast into the lake of fire. Let
all Noble men, and Gentlemen hear this, that they may not
listen unto the whisperings, and croakings of the Locusts of
the bottomlesse pit. Much God hath borne with men in
their ignorance; but if ever men have belonged unto God,
they have known the way of a better faith and repentance,
then ever Popish Religion have taught them, and the holy
Ghost hath helped them in their private prayers, and reading,
or in conference with others, to understand the same.</P>
<P>Obj. 1. <HI>You will say unto me,</HI> but this is a very uncharitable
censure.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Whether doe you thinke it more charity to fore∣warn
men of a desperate danger, or to be indulgent to men,
and to tell them they may be saved in both Religions, when
the word of God is playn against it? What charity count
you that to gull men in a charitable, but a foolish conceit of
their own good estate? It is cruell charity, and most uncha∣ritable,
when the Holy Ghost doth profess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <HI>Their names are
not written in the Lambs booke of life, whosoever worship the
Beast.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 2. <HI>But you will say,</HI> Are not all the Catholicks in the
world perswaded of it, that the devotion to the Catholique Roman
Church is a way of salvation? Catholiques are confident of it, and
you Protestants dare not deny it: And then I pray you whether is it
not safer to be devoted to that Church, wherein all confesse there is a
possibility of salvation, then unto that Church in which one say there is
salvation, the other not?</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="112"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> We answer: So farre as there is any charity, it is
in God, but God hath no such charity: And if any Prote∣stants
be so charitable, they are more charitable then the
word of God allows them: If they say that a man may live
and dye in that Religion, and be saved; The holy Ghost
doth professe the contrary, and would have all the world to
know and believe it.</P>
<P>Therefore let no man build upon the policy of State Pro∣testants.
<HI>Let God be true, and every man be a lyar.</HI> If that the
voyce of the Lord speak, let it be heard, and let the voyce
of <HI>John</HI> be heard, <HI>That if any man be devoted to that Church, hee
cannot live and dye a child of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 3. But what an opinion is this, to cast away our fore-fa∣thers,
that kept such good houses, and such good Christmasses, and Fe∣stivalls,
and double Festivalls, to damne them all to hell: Is it not a
cruell, and barbarous opinion?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I answer, for our Fore-fathers, their soules are in
Gods hand: They lived in those times; but how farre they
were devoted unto the Catholick Religion, wee know not:
This we know, that there was a Temple of God; a company
of Gods people in the darkest times of Popery that did see
their vanity, and did beare witnesse against them, otherwise
we must not out of naturall affections destroy divine Revela∣tion.
A man must in this case <HI>forsake father and mother,</HI> Luk.
14. 26. I speak of it the more, because I know not whether
some of you may have occasion to travell where you shall
finde some that will tell you a quite contrary taile to these
that you have now heard out of the word of God.</P>
<P>For a second Use.</P>
<P>It may serve to teach us the darknesse of our hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> which
is in us generally to believe this: and indeed the impossibility
that any naturall man should heare it, that is to say, so to
heare it as to believe it.</P>
<P><HI>He that hath an eare to heare let him heare;</HI> That is, let him
know and understand it: And this doth argue evidently,
that all that have not hearing eares do not believe this, else
would they see the truth of these things. And let this take
away all admiration from poor Christians, who do often ad∣mire;
<PB N="216" REF="113"/>
why do not such great Doctors and Bishops believe
these things, and see them as well as some poor despicable
Puritans? and why doth not the Catholick Church see it?
The reason is playn why they do not see it, they want eares
to heare, and how should they heare it? Now the Text tells
you, <HI>They that worship the idolls are like unto them,</HI> Psal. 115.
6, 7, 8. <HI>They have mouths, but they speake not: Eyes have they,
but they see not. They have eares but they heare not,</HI> &amp;c <HI>They
that make them are like unto them, so is every one that trusteth in
them.</HI></P>
<P>If they that worship the Beast be like unto the Beast, then
it is not great Learning in the Tongues that can give men
eares to heare. And let not any man be offended, if so be they
see the world of another opinion, if they be but naturall
men; <HI>the naturall man receiveth not these spirituall mysteries,</HI> 1
Cor. 2. 14.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> how much will it lye upon the people of God,
what a weight will it lay upon us all (whether in Church-fellowship,
or out of Church-fellowship) to blesse God who
hath delivered us from the fellowship of this Religion: And
to be everlastingly thankfull, that our next Fathers (though
not our Grand-fathers) have been separated from the wor∣ship
of the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> And how are we bound to stand
for ever stedfast from communion with them, what ever pre∣tences
are put upon us? Be not deceived, you forsake your
owne salvation if you hearken to their whisperings. If you
think your soules precious, then know it, you cannot be re∣conciled
unto <HI>Rome,</HI> but your names are blotted out of the
Lambs book of life.</P>

<P>THat as the Roman Catholicke Church have led the Churches

<P>The reason is from the wisdome and equity of Gods ju∣stice,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason.</NOTE> expresly mentioned in the Text: For, <HI>he that leades into</HI>

<P>The use is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> first of terrour to all Roman Catholicks; what
ever their devotion may be, let them know, and understand,
the issue of it will be utter desolation, and blood and slaugh∣ter
will be their portion one day: And when Gods appoin∣ted
is come, it will be measured unto them, as they have

<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> It may be a great comfort unto the Churches
and Saints of Christ, that have been overcome, or have suffe∣red
any hard-ship from any of these. Those that have been
troublesome to Gods Churches and people, the Lord will

of the land of the living. They shall one day know what
pillars and scourges, and fire and faggot meanes, what tor∣ments
meane, what bloody inquisitions meane: They shall
be recompenced seven-fold into their bosomes.</P>
<P>Here is the patience and faith of the Saints.</P>
<P>The third note is this.</P>
<P>The Lord doth as much acknowledg and accept the patience and
faith of his Saints that have suffered under the Roman Catholique
Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct. 3.</NOTE> as he did the faith and patience of the Primitive Saints, that
suffered under the Roman Pagan Emperours, against Heathenish ido∣latry.</P>
<P>The Papists themselves are full of acknowledgment of the
Primitive Martyrs, and will write many Legends of them;
as the Pharisees, they did build the Sepulchers of the Pro∣phets,
and yet killed their Successors: <HI>Fulfill</HI> (saith Christ)
<HI>the measure of your fathers:</HI> You garnish the sepulchers of the
<PB N="219" REF="114"/>
dead bodies, and yet you kill their Successors. They will ac∣knowledg
them the Primitive Martyrs; but what are those
that suffered in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>Germa∣ny?</HI>
They look at those as <HI>Lolards,</HI> and Hereticks: But what
saith the Lord of them? Even of them as well as of those that
suffered in former times; the Lord doth accept their suffe∣rings,
and saith of them, <HI>Here is the patience and faith of the
Saints.</HI> Wherein the Lord doth acknowledge the faith by
which they overcome this Beast, and patience, <HI>to be the pati∣ence
and faith of the Saints.</HI> The world saith otherwise: but
the Lord saith of those that suffered under this Beast, <HI>Here is
the patience and faith of the Saints.</HI> So in <HI>Rev. 12. 13. Here is
the patience of the Saints: Write, blessed are the dead which dye in
the Lord from hence-forth,</HI> as well as in ancient times: Blessed
are they that dye in the faith of Christ Jesus, in the hottest
and highest times of Popery.</P>
<P>The Reason is evident,</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> because the faith of such Christians, and their pati∣ence,
was the faith and patience of Christ: That is to say,
that which both fastned upon Christ, and bore witnsse unto
Christ, and suffered patiently for Christ as did the Primitive
Christians in the ten Persecutions: And it was such a faith,
as by which they overcame the world, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5. 4. It was
faith in Christ Jesus, even that faith by which they chose <HI>ra∣ther
to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the plea∣sures
of sinne for a season,</HI> Heb. 11. 24, 25. It was that faith by
which they despised honour. Even the same case of Christ in
<HI>Moses</HI> hand, and in their hands, and the point is of like na∣ture:
Roman Idolatry is but another Edition, and their Er∣rors
are as fundamentall subvertions to that which shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be
the faith of Gods elect: And their Government is directly
contrary unto the Gospel-government of Christ Jesus as
light is to darknesse. When their faith in the cause of Christ
do carry them along in suffering for him, it is then the pati∣ence
of Christ. It was the like faith and patience of Christ to
suffer under <HI>Annas</HI> and <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> as under <HI>Herod.</HI> It is true,
in the one he suffered as an enemy to <HI>Caesar,</HI> in the other as a
blasphemer, but the case is all one. No matter what the per∣sons
<PB N="220" REF="115"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Christian in profession; I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the cause be the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Christ, it is the patience and faith of Christ which
is in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> whomsoever they suffer.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Reason is from the greater exercise of saith and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to discern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> and suffer under Christians, against
Christians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Pagans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heathen persecutors.</P>
<P>For the use of the point.</P>
<P>Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> it cryes downe all the scandalous sentences that
Courts have given against the Saints of God; they say here
are the suffering of Lolards and Hereticks: Jesus Christ from
heaven saith, <HI>Here is the faith and patience of the Saints.</HI> Do
not therefore count it obstinacy, and contumacy in heresie,
nor pravity: It is the faith and patience of the Saints; if
Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st calls it so, his word must carry it. When they shall
all appear before his Judgment-seate, whose word shall stand
then, his or theirs? He will say, here is the cruelty and out∣rage
of the persecution of Antichrist that puts the Lambs of
Christ to death.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> It may serve to teach us, how much the Lord
delights to honour his patient and faithfull servants: Hee
writes upon their Toomb-stones as it were, so many Saints,
or faithfull Martyrs of Christ, are those who have thus suffe∣red:
This doth the Lord Jesus Christ write upon their
stakes where they are burned (in <HI>Smithfield</HI> or else-where)
and upon the chains wherewith they are bound.</P>
<P>A great encouragement it is unto Christians to be con∣stant
in the profession of the Gospel, and to contend earnest∣ly
for the faith once given to the Saints. We must not there∣fore
be afraid to stand fast in the profession of the Truth, and
to hold it to the death: If we should dye in his Cause in a
way of persecution to be slaughtered by the outrage of un∣godly
men; what ever the world say of it, the Lord will
from heaven beare this witnesse to it, That it is the patience
and faith of the Saints.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> it must teach all who would suffer for the name
of Christ to be well assured of their cause, and then to adde
constancy to their suffering in their cause. Otherwise, un∣lesse
it be the cause of Christ, it is no patience, but obstinacy,
<PB N="221" REF="115"/>
blindenesse, and ignorance: But see that your cause be the
cause of Christ, and then cleave unto it by the invincible
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith of Gods elect, to overcome the world, and look Lyons
and Dragons in the fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, without fear and astonishment; and
look at punishment and tortour, as not worthy of the glory
that shall be revealed: It looks at them as things that Christ
hath endured greater, and other of the Saints of God have
gone before u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the like, or a greater martyrdome.</P>
<P>Therefore, first, look to the cause, and then believe in the
truth of the cause, and the faithfulnesse of Christ that will
maintaine his servants stable and firme, and cause them to
hold out unto the end. But do not take up your reforma∣tion
upon custome, nor side with any thing for custom of the
country where you are, because your Magistrates and Elders
do commend it to you; for it behooves every christian man
to know well, what he beleives, and practise, and to know the
doctrine of Christ, and the Government and the worship of
Christ; and that not because men say so, but because you see
light for it from the word of the Son of God.</P>
<P>Then your next care is, to look that you depend upon
Christ for strength, that as he suffered for you, you may be
able to suffer for him; ther's the faith of Gods children:
And for patience (I pray consider it) I do not enter into a
common place of faith, and patience; but let me say thus
much of it, Patience is a virtue, mortifying and moderating
greifs, and fears, or afflictions, and subduing our wils to the
will of God, not onely in contentment, but comfort. <HI>My
brethren</HI> (saith <HI>James) count it all joy when you fall into divers
temptations, James</HI> 1. 2. That whereas other men, or our
selves in time of prosperity, when as God applies his will to
our wils, are joyful (and this is no great matter.) This is
the joy of Gods people when God shall apply our wils unto
his. As Christ did comforme his will unto his Fathers will,
and say, <HI>O my God, I delight to do thy will: It is written in thy
book▪ I came to do thy will, Psal.</HI> 40. 8. This indeed doth make
us compleat christians.</P>
<P>A man is a happy man that hath his will and Gods will to∣gether
in all that his heart does desire: If God would have
<PB N="222" REF="116"/>
me suffer, then certain it is best it should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
should christians come armed with faith and patience, and
with wils subdued to the will of the most high; not onely to
be contented, but comfortable in suffering all things for
Christ: And let your faith fasten upon it, and let your pati∣ence
moderate your greifs, and make your hearts comfortable
also, and this is that which God delights in; <HI>Here is the pa∣tience
and faith of the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>And so I will end with that speech of the Apostle; <HI>My bre∣thren,
be ye followers of them, who through faith and patience inhe∣rit
the promises, Heb.</HI> 6. 12. Both by faith of well doing, and

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Rev. 13. 11. to the end of the 17.</BIBL>
<Q>And I beheld another beast coming up out of the
earth, and he had horns like a Lamb, and he
spake as a Dragon, &amp;c.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Ee come now to the description of the second
Beast; <HI>I beheld another Beast,</HI> &amp;c. I do not love
to be large in those Scriptures that do not so
narrowly concern us, as knowing how farre,
and what a vast distance by the grace of God we
stand in here from them: but yet because it is a part of Gods
counsell, and some-what largely described, give me leave to
declare the meaning of the words, and gather such notes
from them as they hold forth.</P>
<P>Observe then, here is a description from the 11th. verse to
the end of the Chapter, of the second Beast; <HI>I saw another
Beast.</HI> The Originall sets him forth by his nature; they that
know the language, knows it signifies only a wild beast, and
in proper speech it signifies such a wilde beast as was veno∣mous;
and therefore the remedy for the venome of this beast,
they call it <HI>Therion,</HI> a proper preservative against venome or
poyson.</P>
<P>This beast is described by four arguments.</P>
<P>1. <HI>By his originall;</HI> He comes out of the earth.</P>
<P>2. By his similitude (or resemblance) in three things.</P>
<P>First, to a Lamb in his horns; <HI>Hee hath two hornes like a
Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, he is resembled to a Dragon in his speech; <HI>He
spake like a Dragon.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, he is resembled to the former beast in the exerci∣sing
<PB N="224" REF="117"/>
of his power; <HI>He exerciseth all the power of the first beast.</HI></P>
<P>3. This beast is described by the particular exercises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
power, or the effects of his power which are these:</P>
<P>1. He causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship
the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed; <HI>he procures ado∣ration
to the first Beast.</HI></P>
<P>2. He doth great wonders, making fire come downe from heaven
in the sight of men, <HI>vers.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>3. He deceives them that dwell on the earth by the meanes
of those miracles.</P>
<P>4. He doth prevaile with them that are on earth to make
an Image to the Beast, which had the wound by the sword,
and did live, <HI>vers.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>5. He doth animate and give life to this image of the Beast,
that this image of the Beast should have both power to speak,
and to cause as many as would not worship the image of the
Beast to be killed.</P>
<P>A sixth effect is, he causeth all sorts of men, rich and poor,
free and bond, to receive a mark in their hand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or at least
his name, or the number of his name, or otherwise hee ex∣cludes
them not only from spirituall, but civill commerce,
<HI>vers.</HI> 16, 17.</P>
<P>For the Notes that these words afford, I will handle them
all in two: They will not need much enlargement, the Ex∣plication
and Application of them will reach the meaning,
and scope of the words. Remember what the first Beast was,
and then you will more easily know what this Beast must be.
You know this first Beast being described to have seven heads,
and ten horns, was taken by all for the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; and
this being not that, but another that comes in his room af∣ter
him: Is is evident then that this Beast must either be the
<HI>Roman-Heathen</HI> Empire, or the <HI>Roman-Christian</HI> Empire, or
the Roman-catholick visible Church; one of these three Ro∣man
States it must be.</P>
<P>Not the first, for this rose after that was cast down; after
the Dragon was cast out of Heaven, and had no more to rule
that State. Also you heard in <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. that Beast had ten
crowns on the heads; this hath not Crowns on the heads,
<PB N="225" REF="117"/>
but on the horns; the Princes and heads of that State were
crowned: This doth not weare the temporall Crown, but
those Princes that mayntaine him, they weare the Crowns.</P>
<P>Againe, that Beast, Pagan <HI>Rome,</HI> did not begin his time of
prosperity, and flourishing, with the womans flight into the
wildernesse, and the <HI>two witnesses prophecying in sackcloath, a
thousand two hundred and sixty dayes;</HI> for their government en∣ded,
when the Christian State began, and therefore it could
not be Pagan-heathen <HI>Rome;</HI> Nor could it be the Christian
Imperial Roman <HI>State:</HI> For</P>
<P>1. It is said in the second <HI>vers.</HI> That <HI>the Dragon gave him his
power, and his seate, and great authority;</HI> but that he did not to
the Christian Emperours, for they would not live at <HI>Rome,</HI>
but at <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>2. It was never made a signe of reprobation to worship the
Roman Christian Emperors, but it is made a sign of repro∣bation
to worship this Beast.</P>
<P>It remayns therefore, that this Beast described in the for∣mer
pare of the Chapter, is the third Roman State; which
being not Rome-Pagan, nor Rome-Christian, it must needs
be the Roman Papall <HI>State,</HI> under the government of the
Pope, and that is no other but the Roman Catholick visible
Church, to which all the description you have heard ope∣ned
doth naturally belong.</P>
<P>Now that being the first beast, what is this second beast?
This is apparantly distinct from it; and it is not so proper to
say, that the first beast was the Pope, as he had soveraign au∣thority
in Temporalls; and that he is the second Beast as he
hath supream power in Spiritualls, for he had his Tempo∣rall
power l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st: and therefore that would not agree to the
P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll State; he first had supream power in Spirituals, before
he had supream power in Temporals. Now the beast here
being not the Roman Catholick Church, what is it then? It
is the head of that Church; and what is that? It is no other
but the Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> The heads of the Roman Catholique
visible Church, from one succession to another, they are this
second be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st; and that will appeare in a double note, which
will both cleare that, and the rest of the Text.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="118"/>
First then, take this note;</P>
<P>That the Bishop or Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> is in the sight of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctrine 1.</NOTE> and of
his Saints, no better then a wilde beast, for his Originall, arising out
of the earth; for his resemblance, like to a Lamb in his borns; like
to a Dragon in his speech; like to the whole Roman Catholick
Church in his power.</P>
<P>This is the former part of the description by his Adjunct,
by his Similitude, and by his Originall: However he seems to
Catholicks a holy Father, and a god on earth; yet in the
sight of God, and of his Saints, he is no better the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a wilde
Beast, whose off-spring is from the earth; who though he
have horns like a Lamb, yet speaks like a Dragon, and thus
<HI>John</HI> guided by the holy Ghost, saw him. Let me shortly o∣pen
these points.</P>
<P>1. <HI>He is here described to be a wilde beast▪]</HI> The word so sig∣nifies;
that is to say, not so tame a beast as those in <HI>Isa▪</HI> 11,
6. to 9. <HI>that a child may lead them:</HI> Wolves, or Leopards, or Lyons
that can sleep with Kids, and Calves, and little children, <HI>and
they may play on the hole of the Aspe, and put their hand on the
Cockatrice den:</HI> He is not so tame, that hee can be tamed by
the word of Truth, or by the censures of the Church, no nor
by the power of Princes; he is above them all, and beyond
them all; a wild beast he is therefore.</P>
<P>For his Originall, <HI>He ariseth out of the earth.]</HI> That im∣plyeth,
he hath it not from Heaven, but from below; not
from Christ, but from Satan; <HI>You are from beneath</HI> (saith
Christ) <HI>I am from above,</HI> John 8. 23. Hee springs from the
earth, especially from earthly and carnall policy; that for
keeping of good agreement in the Churches, they must be
folded up into certain Metropolitans or Patriarchs; and to
keep unity, you must have one over them all, and that was
the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> for all unity they say springs from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nits;
if you have more then one Governour, you will have
no peace: Now this being a carnall principle, some carnall
reason being the ground for the preservation of the Church
of <HI>Rome;</HI> for that the Emperours thought, if the Bishop of
<HI>Rome</HI> were advanced, it would be a means to strengthen them
against the barbarous Nations that come against them; this
<PB N="227" REF="118"/>
carnall reason brought him to be exalted: And though his
Originall was earthly for the cause, yet he ascended above
the earth to Ecclesiasticall power. And</P>
<P>2. He arose out of the Earth, because he rose up insensi∣bly
by degrees, he makes no great noyse; As any thing that
comes out of the earth, it makes no great noyse in its grow∣ing,
but at length comes to a vast height: So it was with the
Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> this is his descent out of the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>For his resemblance,</HI> He hath horns like a Lamb.]</P>
<P>Horns expresse his power: <HI>Like a Lamb;</HI> that is, <HI>like the
Lamb of God.</HI> Church-power he claims directly, no other
at least for a long time; The power of binding and loosing
were his two horns, to bind all, and loose all, and that lay
in the closet of his own breast when to put it forth; this is
but the power of the Lamb.</P>
<P>But he spake like a Dragon.]</P>
<P>You have two or three severall speeches of the Dragon. In
<HI>Rev. 12. 9. The old Serpent is called the Dragon:</HI> What did hee
speak?</P>
<P>1. Venomous words to our first Parents; <HI>You shall not dye
at all,</HI> Gen. 3. 4. And so the Pope he draws the hearts of men
from conscience of the word.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The speech of the Dragon, it is imperious and arro∣gant:</HI>
All the kingdomes of the earth will I give thee, if thou wilt
fall downe and worship me, <HI>Luk.</HI> 4. 6, 7.</P>
<P><HI>And that is the speech of the Pope in</HI> Jer. 1. 10. I have set
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this day over the Nations, and over the kingdomes, to roote out,
and to pull downe, and to destroy, and to throw downe, and to build,
and to plant: <HI>And the Pope sends a Crown with this inscrip∣tion
to</HI> Frederick <HI>the Emperour; Christ gave this power to</HI>
Peter, <HI>and</HI> Peter <HI>gave it to the Pope, this is Imperiall State.
And</HI></P>
<P>3. The Dragon hath a devouring and ravenous mouth,
whereby he speaks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avenous words: <HI>Whoever will not worship
the Image that I have set up, shall be cast into a hot fiery furnace, and
who is that God that is able to deliver you?</HI> Dan. 3. 15. And you
have heard what worship the Pope claymes, and what he
threatens if it be neglected. Thus you see in Gods account,
<PB N="228" REF="119"/>
and in the sight of <HI>John,</HI> the Pope is a wild Beast: and the
holy Ghost as he insp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red <HI>John,</HI> he directs him what to say;
The holy Apostle he stood upon the sand of the Sea, and few
two beasts; one arisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g out of the Sea of corruption in do∣ctrine,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And another out of the earth, out of earthly
pretences; He sees no holinesse in this Beast, nothing but
beastly cruelty, and beastly blasphemy, nothing but argues a
wilde beast that will not be tamed, neither by the Church of
God, nor by the word of God, nor by Princes and States:
He sees him rising out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ire pretences, pretending nothing
but Lamb-like power; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee speakes like a Dragon, veno∣mous
and devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing words: Damnable heresies, as being
spewed out of the Dragons mouth, such a volume of false
worship, and doctrine, and government, as destroys the faith
of the Church, and subverts the foundation of the Church:
This is the very state of the Pope as <HI>John</HI> beheld it, as he was
wrap't up in a vision by the Spirit, and he judged of it as hee
saw it.</P>
<P>Now because I cannot so well make use of this, before I
have spoken of the rest, because they are co-incident, take
this for a second Note, and so make use of both together.
The note is long, but it is but the collection of the sum of
these verses, the words of the Text will bring the Doctrine
easily to remembrance; This then is the note.</P>
<P>The Bishop of Rome exerciseth all the Authority of the first Beast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct. 2.</NOTE>
that is, of the Roman visible Catholick Church, he causeth all that
dwell on the Earth to worship that Church, he doth worke wonders,
even to the fetching of fire from Heaven, and by his wonders procures
all christian States to make an Image to the first Beast, and gives such
life and power to the Image of the Beast that it is able to speak, and
it shall cause such as do not worship it to be put to death, and finally he
leaves an impression, or imprints a character upon all sorts of christi∣ans,
and will suffer none to enjoy spirituall or civill communion with
them, unlesse such as will receive either his marke, or his name, or the
number of his name.</P>
<P>I put them into a doctrinall frame, because they are the
sum of the words of the Text. Let me breifly open them
all.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="119"/>
First, <HI>He doth exercise all the Authority of the first Beast.</HI> Let
all that are acquainted either with the writings of the Roma∣nists,
or of our Divines that bear witnesse against <HI>Rome,</HI> be
testimonies in this case; what is there that the Catholick
Church claimes, but the Pope can do it all: There are six or
seven trascendant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts of power, which that Church claymes,
and the Pope familiarly exerciseth them all.</P>
<P>1. The Pope hath power to convent generall Councels;
or if the Emperours will call a general Councel, it shall not
stand in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce unlesse the Catholick Church and the Bishops
meet in a representative Synod, it concludes with their deter∣mination;
this he pleads for to this day, it belongs not to
the Emperors, nor to Christian Princes, but to the Bishop of
<HI>Rome:</HI> It is one of <HI>Bellarmines</HI> affirmations, that one Church
shall have power to call all Churches, be it to <HI>Florence,</HI> or
<HI>Basseil,</HI> thether they must go whether he will.</P>
<P>2. As the Catholick Roman Church did usurpe power to
make Laws and Canons to binde all Churches; So the Pope
doth challenge the same power to make Laws to binde all
Churches; he pleads for it, and will not be content without
it.</P>
<P>3. Look as the Catholick visible Roman Church doth
claime Authority of ratifying Scriptures; if they put in the
Apocrypha, it shall be good Scripture; and if the Church do
not approve the Gospel of <HI>Matthew</HI> in Greek, but in Hebrew, it
shall be that; or if they refuse both them, and take the vulgar
Latine, that shall stand: This power the Catholick Church
challengeth power to do, and the same doth the Pope.</P>
<P>4. If the Roman Catholick visible Church challenge a po∣wer
of interpreting Scripture, and judging of controversies
with infalibility of judgement: The Pope challengeth that
to himselfe when he interprets Scripture, or decides contro∣versies
about Religion, he cannot erre, and so they make ac∣count
he is a fit Judge therein.</P>
<P>5. Look as you see the Roman Catholick visible Church
had power of binding and loosing, challengeth all appleal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and great things they will do by that priveledge, excommu∣nicate
some of many Churches that are absent, some they ex∣communicate
<PB N="230" REF="120"/>
for seven years, some to their death, that the
shall not be reconciled: All this the Pope challengeth in a
larger measure then the old Roman visible Church did chal∣lenge.
This the Roman Bishop challengeth to binde consci∣ence,
to loose oathes and covenants between Prince and peo∣ple,
between man and wife, to loose vows, and oaths, and na∣tural
relations, between parents and children, if they will
shrowd themselves in a Monastery, and will dispence against
the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in case of incest: this is such a power to loose
the bonds of Gods commandments, and Gods oaths, and re∣lations
to God and his servants, it is such Transcendant po∣wer,
the Roman visible Catholick Church never challenged
greater.</P>
<P>6. The Roman visible Catholick Church never challen∣ged
so great power till it was animated and acknowledged by
the Pope, to take upon them to set up one King, and to take
down another; King <HI>John</HI> in England, <HI>Frederick</HI> the first, and
<HI>Frederick</HI> the second, <HI>Henery</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henery</HI> the fifth;
he crowns and discrowns whom he will, and this out of the
plentitude of his power.</P>
<P>And lastly, he doth challenge this beyond the Church it
selfe, Immunity, and Impunity from all Civill and Ecclesiasti∣cal
power, and judicature. The Church is above all j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dicial
power, and the Pope the head of it is above it, and therefore
may not be brought into order by any censure of any Church,
nor by the civil sword: And therefore he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well called one
that exerciseth all the power of the first Beast, and rather puts
more power to it; whatever the Catholick Church may do,
that he can do; where they can dispence and make Laws,
where they can bind or loose, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So farre as they may
go, he can go, and he doth all in the name, and sight of the
Church.</P>
<P>And he causeth all that dwell on the Earth.] <HI>That is, carnal
christians,</HI> whose conversation is not in Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>To worship the first Beast.]</HI> How to worship? He speaks of
divine worship not civil adoration: This is an aberation
from a Church; but a beastly Church, it is a monster; The
Church of the first institution was of one particular congre∣gation;
<PB N="231" REF="120"/>
and for all the Churches of the world to be subject
to one Cathedral, it is far beyond all comprehension of rule:
Now he causeth all that dwell on the Earth to worship that
Beast. Wherein are they to worship him?</P>
<P>1. It is made a matter of necessity to salvation to be recon∣ciled
to that Church; and more care is had of being recon∣ciled
to that Church, then of being reconciled to God in
Christ: All pleas of being reconciled to Christ will not stand
in their judgment, unlesse you be reconciled to them.</P>
<P>2. Except you be bound in conscience to that state, he will
allow you no communion; he will have all the decrees of
the Church as binding the conscience.</P>
<P>3. This is divine worship, you shall take no doctrine but
that is of his stamp, nor worship, nor Government but of his
acknowledgment, nor no dispensation of them but according
to his Canons: And all that dwell on the Earth must wor∣ship
him, all run upon the Beast; the Pope doth not so much
challenge it to himselfe as to the Church, and that which is
given to the Church he takes to himselfe.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>He doth great wonders, so that he makes fire come
from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of men:</HI> And it is said,
<HI>Antichrist shall come in all power of signes and lying wonders, 2 Thes.</HI>
2. 8, 9. Their Legions are full of these wonders: And in
particular, for this point, of causing fire to come down from
Heaven: It is an allusion sure to the fire that the old Prophet
fetched from Heaven: As <HI>Eliah fetched fire from Heaven to con∣sume
the sacrifice, 1 Kings</HI> 18. 38, 39. And that was a fire that
expressed Gods gracious acceptance, that made all the people
cry, <HI>the Lord he is God:</HI> But this the Pope did not fetch sure,
he never fetched any acceptance from Heaven. But you read
of another fire fetched from Heaven by <HI>Eliah,</HI> and that was,
<HI>to destroy those that mocked him, 2 Kings</HI> 1. 10. 12. Which pra∣ctise
when <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John</HI> would have followed in <HI>Luke</HI> 9. 54,
55, 56. You shall read, that they being offended with the <HI>Sa∣maritans</HI>
because they would not receive them; <HI>Master</HI> say
they, <HI>shall we call for fire from Heaven to consume them as</HI> Eliah
<HI>did?</HI> Our Saviour utterly rejects that; <HI>You know not,</HI> saith he,
<HI>of what spirit ye are:</HI> Now minde you, that fetching fire from
<PB N="232" REF="121"/>
Heaven, which is to destroy mens lives, and not save them,
that <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John</HI> are taught to refus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as being incompati∣ble
to the Gospel: But that which they refuse, the Successour
of <HI>Peter,</HI> as they call him, takes up; if any <HI>Scribe,</HI> or <HI>Pharisee,</HI>
or <HI>Samaritan</HI> refuse him, then fire comes down from Heaven,
consuming fire, and vengance, and wrath, and blood-shed,
and extreamity of outraged evils he causeth to come down
upon them; and in pretence from Heaven, to destroy the
Church and people of God, that I take to be the cheif par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the meaning of that. But if any man will urge the letters
of the Text (which you need not in mystical Scriptures) yet
it is not without truth therein.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> the seventh he declares this, that he had strange po∣wer,
when he had much people about him, he would have sha∣ked
the sleeve of his gound, and caused fire to come down;
Now it is evident it might be, for he was a Conjurer, and 22.
Popes together (as their own storyes do record) they were
wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches, and gave their soules to the Devil, that they might
obtaine the Popedome, but they were but lying wonders;
for miracles require divine power, but the Devil cannot go
beyond the power of nature; so that you may take it in the
proper meaning; their own men do much magnifie it, and
make it one of the markes of their Churche, whereas Prote∣stants
that want miracles are not Churches: So that those
censures by which they thundred against christian Emperors,
they did follow with such success, that they made all wonder,
that none could stand against them, not <HI>Henery</HI> the fourth,
nor <HI>Henery</HI> the fifth, not <HI>Leo</HI> the Emperour, nor the King of
<HI>Fraunce,</HI> none of them all were able to take up armes against
him; they did all admire him; <HI>Who is able to stand against him,
end to make Warre with him?</HI> And that gave such free passage to
his Laws, that all christian States presently took up what in∣junctions
he put upon them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, by these miracles, and the mighty successe of
them, he had power <HI>to cause them that dwell on the earth to make
an Image to the Beast, that had the deadly wound, and was healed;</HI>
that is, the Roman Catholick visible Church: What is this
Image of the Beast? he causeth all the earth, that is, all earthly
<PB N="233" REF="121"/>
States to receive it; he will suffer none to be without it:
what is this Image? an Image not of their own making, they
must make an Image by his appointment: It is an Image of
the first beast, not of the second directly, and consequently
the officers of that Beast must represent this second Beast, but
be an Image of the first: if the first Beast was the Roman Ca∣tholick
visible Church; then if he causeth all the Earth to
make an Image to that Beast, then he causeth all Churches
and Common-wealths, to frame their State and platforme,
according to the Image of the Roman Catholick visible
Church, and therefore he causeth all Christian Princes to erect
all their Churches in a Roman Catholick way: what is that?
Metropolitan, National, Provnciall, Diocesan, Cathedral,
and Provincial Churches; These are all lively characters of
the Roman Catholick Church, reserving stil pre-emenency to
their mother Catholick Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but otherwise they
are the lively Image of such a Church, even as daughters are
of their mothers: and being overcome with the power of his
miracles, and deceits, and delusions (as you heard) by the
Policy of Canonists, by carnall Policy, and by their Votaries,
and by working miracles, signes, and lying wonders; it is a
wonder to see what power he had, that all the power of the
Popedome, and of the Catholick Church was in a model and
representation drawn in all Churches in <HI>Christendome</HI> during
the time of 42. moneths, which is 1260. years, and then a
great part of his Image was marred in a great part of Chri∣stendome,
but yet he still continues; so then there is a lively
Image of the Roman Catholick Church, though it may be,
some are drawn from subjection thereunto; and yet though
they be drawn off from subjection to it, yet still the Image, and
representation is written in the very foreheads of such Chur∣ches;
that is a fourth thing.</P>
<P>Fiftly, <HI>He had power to give life to the Image of the Beast;</HI> what
life? that it should both speak, and cause, <HI>That as many as
would not worship the Image of the Beast should be killed:</HI> How
doth he put this life into the Image of this Beast to speak? It
is, to speak with authorty, as in <HI>verse 5. A mouth speaking
great things;</HI> He would speak, and speak with authority;
<PB N="234" REF="122"/>
that now these Diocesan, Metropolitan, and Provinciall
Churches, they can speak with authority, as the Roman Ca∣tholick
Church doth, and their words must take place, and
he puts that life into it by his own canons and laws which
they take up; the canons and laws made by the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> do so animate Provincial, and Diocesan Churches, that
they speak the same language, not altogether so corrupt, but
with like authority, and require like subjection of all per∣sons;
and by your leave, they grow to it for very conscience
sake; that those things which were indifferent before, yet
being laws of the Church, now they must binde conscience;
this is to speak great things. Now they have power likewise
<HI>to cause as many as will not worship the Image of the Beast, they shall
be killed;</HI> a signe none of them took that power like the beast;
but yet though they have not power to kill them, yet to deli∣ver
them to the Secular power, and they must kill them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whatever the Diocesan Church doth agree on against her He∣reticks,
that will not obey the Government or doctrine of
the Church; what then? The deliver him to the Secular
power, then they cause him to be put to death, and they deli∣ver
him to fire and faggot, so you see the mighty power of
this Beast.</P>
<P>There is one thing remaining of his power, and that is the
sixth and last effect, He causeth all, both small and great, rich
and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand,
or in their foreheads: Kings, and Princes, Ministers and Cler∣gy
men (as they call them) high and low, whatever they be,
he causeth them all to receive a character, or marke, either in
their right hand, or in their foreheads.</P>
<P>A marke in the hand; that character themselves call an
indelible character, and they receive that who receive any
orders from the Pope, and are reconciled to the Roman Ca∣tholick
visible Church; This Beast causeth all to receive a
marke, that is, they shall sweare fidelity, and loyalty to the
Roman Catholick visible Church, this they make indelible;
wherever they come, <HI>they are Priests for ever after the order of
Melchesidech.</HI></P>
<P>Or on their foreheads; they have a marke answerable to
<PB N="235" REF="122"/>
their name; their name, what is that but Roman Catholicks?
or else there is no fellowship with them; and all must at
length have that name, and go under the number of that
name, Roman Catholicks; there is the number of that name:
but I leave that to the next time (as being too large to enter
into at present.) In the mean time, you see these things
thus opened, touching the nature and character of this second
Beast.</P>
<P>Now to make some use of all.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> it may be an evident conviction, and demonstrati∣on,
and designation of this Beast who it is: Is hath been
much disputed, but all the parts of this description doth di∣rectly
fall upon the Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> that if <HI>John</HI> had lived
in these dayes, he would have seene all this with his eyes,
which he saw in a vision: No man can tell where to bestow
all this description for 1260. years, but upon the Bishop of
<HI>Rome,</HI> that is of such a wilde nature, that no Church, no law
of God, no society of men, no Kings, nor Princes can rule;
and all the world that knows this Beast, knows this to be true
of the Pope, whose Original (all Christians know) springs
from the Earth, to keep men in unity, and to preserve the Em∣pire
from inundations of Barbarians, to keep Christian Prin∣ces
closer together, and in better order, all carnall policy out
of which he springs, yet incensibly, and slowly, that he is not
discerned for many years together.</P>
<P><HI>And he hath horns like a Lamb,</HI> that he pretends nothing but
(Saint <HI>Peter</HI> as they call it) the Keys of the kingdom of Hea∣ven;
<HI>But he speaks like a Dragon,</HI> as if he had the Keys of the
bottomlesse pit; he thunders such sentences, gives dispensa∣tions
both against the lawes of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> to dissolve
oaths, and covenants, and relations, they shall marry whom
they will, their own sisters: he will venom with such noy∣some
doctrine, as the breath of them will stinke: he will
speak so terrible, that time was, when Princes were to trem∣ble;
<HI>he hath spoken as a Dragon:</HI> The Devil himselfe as he ru∣led
the Roman Pagan Empire, hath not spoken greater words
then he: Those that spake, <HI>Whoever will not worship an Image
set up, shall be cast in a fiery furnace,</HI> it is not a greater word then
he speaks.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="123"/>
Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">V;se 2.</NOTE> this doth justly reprove all the Popish admi∣ring
and adoring of the man of Sinne; They look at him as
their holy Father, and Bishop of Christ, and Vicar of God, as
one that hath an infallible judgment, that cannot erre, that
he is above all power of censure: If he should draw missions
of soules to hell, no man must say, Sir, why do you so? they
have this opinion of him: No matter what they conceive, he
must be judged by the King of Kings, and by the God of Gods,
and by the Saints of that God that judgeth according to the
word; and they look at this Father as a Monster, as a wilde
beast, whom no Scripture, no Church can keepe in awe,
but he is Lord paramount above them all; they look at him
as the Dragon of the bottomlesse pit, as he that destroys the
Christian world: and however he may pretend, as if he had
nothing but Lamb-like power, yet <HI>hee speakes like a Dragon;</HI>
thus <HI>John</HI> saw him.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> Observe from hence a reason of a note that trou∣bles
many Interpreters; That if this beast have such power,
why doth he not cause the earth to worship himself? why
doth he not provide for his own honour, but for the first
beast? The reason is plain; the first Beast being the Roman
Catholick Church, and the head of that Beast, all the ho∣nour
that redounds to the beast, falls upon the head of the
beast, and it is upon himselfe; He exerciseth all that power
that the first beast hath, and therefore no marvell if he labour
to draw all men what he can to worship, not himselfe, but
the Roman Catholick Church, to be reconciled to it, and re∣ceive
decrees from it, and submit in conscience thereunto,
and receive no worship nor doctrine but from them, nor go∣vernment,
but established by them; no Lawes to be enjoyned
and transacted but by them, for he knows that this honour
will redound to him; He knows all this power doth rest in
his own breast, and it is he that acts the Roman Catholick
Church, and he can do with a Councell, and without a
Councell what the Church can do, and he failes not to do
it from time to time. Wonder not therefore that he puts off
the honour to the first beast, the old Roman Church, there
he layes all his devotion, but in conclusion it is all for him∣selfe.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="123"/>
Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> you may see the corrupt Originall, and dange∣rous
State of corrupt religion, and of such kind of Chur∣ches
as are drawn out by the modell of the Roman Catholick
visible Church, any image of that beast: I do not trouble you
with what others think to be the image of the Beast (I should
but weary my selfe in so doing) but if the first beast be the
Roman Catholick Church, as it must needs be, then the i∣mage
must be according to it, though not of equall authori∣ty,
yet of the like frame; whereas the Lord hath instituted
no other but particular Congregations to bring in a whole
Nation (that may containe a thousand Congregations) in∣to
one Church, what an image is this of the Roman visible
Catholick Church: It is not Catholick indeed, it is short
of that, but so large as it carries a Nation, it exceeds Dio∣cesan,
and Diocesan exceeds particular Congregations:
Now see the danger of this; you see the first rise was from the
power of this beast, <HI>He causeth all the earth to make an Image of
this Beast:</HI> He did not bring them to make one in number, but
one in <HI>England,</HI> and one in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and one in <HI>France,</HI> and
one in <HI>Germany,</HI> and in every Countrey according to their
divisions, and Princely Potentates; that all that dwell in the
limits of that Jurisdiction, they have one Cathedral Church,
to which all other Parochiall Churches do belong; this hee
causeth them to do: and when he hath done it, giveth it the
very like breath of the <HI>Roman</HI> Order; though not in so vast a
measure, yet in a faire modell, that they are like the image
of this holy Father, and so by this meanes it comes to passe,
by his Laws and Canons which he perswades all to receive,
and which is a wonder, since they have cut him off from be∣ing
head of the Church, yet still they reteyn the life of Papa∣cy,
in the State of such Chancellors, and Parators, and such
kind of Civill, and Ecclesiasticall power mingled together;
that a Cathedrall Church forty or fifty miles off, shall send
terrible censures to cut off the poor Saints of God, and they
must obey it; and if they stand in an Hereticall course (as
they call it) there is no living for them, they will kill their
Propheticall life, as they did the two Witnesses; or if they
do in any effectuall manner work, they will not stick to call
<PB N="238" REF="124"/>
them to account, and cast them out, and deliver them to
the Secular power, and they shall deliver them to fire and
sword.</P>
<P>So then, see the danger of such Constitutions, it was
wrought by the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and lives by life from him,
the life of the Law of God breaths not in the pulses of it; any
that know them, know how far they be from the pattern of
the Scripture, how ridiculous they be to such as discern the
state of them; You see also what mighty power they have,
that all civill States have been contented to deliver such to
fire and sword, whom they have delivered up as Hereticks:
They soon loose the protection of the Civill State, if they
loose the favour of imaginary Churches; well doth he call
them images, they are images of the Pope, and images which
God forbids, and the inventions of the sonnes of men; <HI>Thou
shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image,</HI> in the second Com∣mandement:
You shall make no Images of Officers, nor Go∣vernment,
nor worship, but that which Christ himselfe hath
set up.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 5.</NOTE> it lets us see how dangerous it is, to annex civill
penalties, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> upon such as are cast out of the Church;
an usuall thing in Popish Churches, or in the Images of such.
First, they suspend them from the Sacrament, but then it
comes with an Excommunication, no man must buy nor
sell, he hath refused to honour the image of the Beast: It is
dangerous to bring in civill Authority immediately upon
Church-censure: A warning to us here, that if men be ex∣communicated,
not to deny them civill Commerce, or to
say such as stand out excommunicated so long, shall no
longer enjoy the priviledges of the State: The Church may
cut them off from fellowship with it selfe, there may be just
reason so to do; they may discover such hypocrifie as may
make them unfit for the Church, but yet they may not alto∣gether
be unfit for the Common-wealth.</P>
<P>Sixthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 6.</NOTE> It may serve to humble us so farr, as in times past
we had any thing to do with this Beast, eyther in the loynes
of our Fathers with this first Beast, the Roman Catholick
visible Church, or as in our own time we have had any com∣munion
<PB N="239" REF="124"/>
(I meane Ecclesiasticall communion) with the i∣mage
of this first Beast, that is, with Provinciall, Diocesan,
Cathedrall, National Churches.</P>
<P>You know it is not my manner to fall into speeches of
Christs in other parts, it is best for us to look to our owne;
but when the Text is just so fit, now to be silent, were to de∣ny
the children of God the bread of their portion: If it be
such a Church as is of the Popes devising, as hath provoked
the jealousie of God, and hath not been derived from the
primitive institution that Christ hath established; then so far
as we have had to deale with them, either in office, or out of
office, receiving their Sacraments, and their Censures, or
have published their Censures, though God (it may be) mer∣cifully
kept us from publishing such as we did conceive un∣just;
yet forasmuch as there hath been any submittance in this
kind, any Church-communion, whereby we have been ad∣mitted
into Church-office by the Image of this beast, or instal∣led
by the ordination of the first beast, or so far as wee have
submitted to the first or second Beast; so far as we have par∣taked
in the holy things of God, which flow from Church-communion,
as Sacraments and Censures do, verily so farre
we have cause to be humbled; though the Lord kept any of
us from thinking it any necessity to be reconciled to the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or kept us from sundry things in our pra∣ctice,
which the Image of the Beast required; and though he
kept us also from receiving all their Dictates without con∣troll;
yet for our practice in entring into our calling, and
our dispensations which have been but images of the first
beast: and so far as our fellowship in Ordinances with them
have cleaved to that Church, verily the guilt of that will lye
upon such soules as have not unfeignedly bewailed it before
the Lord.</P>
<P>What think you might be the cause that Christians do
complayn of so much deadnesse, under such plenty, and (as
some say) power of Ordinances? I might as justly blame
the world for as great part, that men think they are forced
to lanch out in building and planting; an evill haunt and
custome hath been rivetred into mens spirits, that they have
<PB N="240" REF="125"/>
much ado to be content any where; but this is not all: Nor
can I lay it wholly upon over-much confidence in Ordinan∣ces;
we have heretofore thought men happy that had liberty
of Ordinances, though out in a duty of humiliation; God will
let you see the emptinesse of all Ordinances, &amp; that there is no
life in them further then he puts in them; but I will not put in
neither of both these, though both these may challenge a part
of the deadnesse of the Countrrey, and may because of humi∣liation:
But giue me leave to say, I feare this chiefly, that men
thought it enough that they were got out of the reach of
Summoners, and Pariters, and such like, whose offices have
been by the power of the beast, the remnants whereof hang
in those places where they should not stand; I feare men have
rested in turning their backs upon such troubles as they were
put unto, when they have not been serious in judging them∣selves
for these Images of jealousie, when they are so loft to
be rent from them, I feare the Lord hath not humbled them
for their old contagion, and therefore they are not so dead,
for what is an Image but deadnesse? truly because we are ra∣ther
in bodily presence, then in heart departed from them,
therefore there is such deadnesse: what's the reason, that up∣on
the least motion, men are ready to remove to a new Plan∣tation,
as if they removed from old <HI>England</HI> to New in a
pang: If men had a calling upon just grounds to come hi∣ther,
then when we come where the Ordinances of God are,
we should sit down under the Ordinances, under the shadow
of the Almighty, and never look for more: But when that
doth not satisfie that we enjoy Ordinances, all that liberty
we did desire, we do enjoy, and yet it doth not satisfie;
certainly there is some sinne lyes in the breast still, for which
the Lord pursues men with a restlesse frame, they are not yet
purged from the image of Romish pollution, and therefore
the Lord sees it not meet to give us rest, no not in <HI>Sion,</HI> be∣cause
in heart we are not returned from <HI>Babell,</HI> but every
new occasion puts us to a new plantation, and when we are
there we cannot rest: And therefore I feare, because we have
not judged our selves for our inordinate walking in polluted
Churches, but have rather sought for our own peace, then
<PB N="241" REF="125"/>
purity from these pollutions, which there have defiled us, or
do not see any great need of judging our selves in that kinde;
thence it is, that to this day the Lord hath much ado to qui∣et
our hearts in his peace and purity, and in power, but still
we are much destitute of inward purity and power of godli∣nesse,
and therefore dead heartednesse hangs about us to this
day. And therefore as we desire the power, and purity, and
peace of Ordinances stamped upon our hearts, so we are to
bewaile the contagions we have had in this Image of the beast
with Officers or people, that so the Lord may give a reviving
according to the desire of our hearts.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 7.</NOTE> let it be of much praise and thanksgiving to God,
that hath delivered us and ours, from these Contagions and
pollutions, in which you see all that dwell on the earth have
been intangled and polluted in time past: That he hath deli∣vered
us from the power of this Beast (the Roman Catholick
Church) that he hath freed us from making an Image to that
Beast; we own none of his Ordinances, and that God hath
removed us from the marke of this Beast, that we desire not to
be accounted Catholicks, nor Hirarchies, nor stand members
of a Diocesan, or Provinciall, or Cathedrall, or Nationall
Church, but beare witnesse against them all: And also that
he hath freed us in some measure from the number of his
name; that many things that are of number and account
with them, are not of any number with us, if there be any
thing of the Beast in it. And therefore it is matter of great
praise to God; You shall read of the hundred and forty foure
thousand, that God had gotten victory over the Image, and
mark of the Beast, and over his name, and the number of his
name, or had not left them in any bondage, they sung as it
were a new song before the Throne; It is great matter of
praise that here we may enjoy no head but the Lord Jesus.
<HI>(Saul</HI> indeed was head of the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> but not of the
Church, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15. 17.) That the Lord hath given us to
enjoy Churches, and Congregational Assemblies by his Co∣venant,
to worship him in all his holy Ordinances; that he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given us to look for no Laws but his word, no rules nor
forms of worship, but such as he hath set downe in his word;
<PB N="242" REF="126"/>
no platforms of Doctrine, but such as are held forth in the
word of the Prophets and Apostles: It is such a priviledge,
that for 1260. years, the Christian world knew not the mea∣ning
of it, unlesse it were here and there a few whom God
had sealed (this was the priviledg of a few sealed ones) but
this the Lord vouchsafeth to us this day, above all Nations
that have power of the civill sword: It is true, there is a great
deale of these things in sundry other Churches, but yet there
is a tang of the image of the Beast, that a company of Elders
and Ministers, they shall have power to impose Officers up∣on
Churches, and to excommunicate Officers and Members;
It is too much the image of the first Beast, and too much of
the power of both Beasts, and therefore it is to be lamented:
but that the Lord should give us such liberty, that all our
Churches are not subordinate one to another, and none ar∣rogate
nor plead Supremacy, but are preserved and kept from
all contagion of the first and second beast, this calls us to a∣bundant
thankfulnesse, and wee are to desire that the Lord
would keep us at such a distance, that we may never return
to the image of either of the beasts.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hese words are some part of the description of the
second Beast which arose after the former, conti∣nued
from the 11<SUP>th</SUP>. <HI>verse</HI> of this <HI>Chap.</HI> unto the end
of it. The former beast (as you have often heard)
is the <HI>Roman-Catholick visible Church,</HI> described at large from
the first <HI>verse</HI> to the end of the 10<SUP>th</SUP>. The latter Beast is the
head of the <HI>Catholique Church,</HI> the Bishop, or <HI>Antichrist</HI> of
<HI>Rome,</HI> and he is here described,</P>
<P>1. <HI>By his Originall;</HI> He came out of the earth.</P>
<P>2. <HI>By his resemblance; which is three-fold;</HI> To the Lamb in
his hornes; To the Dragon in his tongue and speech, and to the first
beast in his power; He exerciseth all the power of the first beast.</P>
<P>3. As he is described thus by his Originall, and by his re∣semblance,
so he is described by his great power, and his
power exerciseth it selfe in divers acts. First, <HI>He exerciseth all
the power of the first beast.</HI> Now the first beast being the <HI>Roman
Catholique Church,</HI> he exerciseth all the power of the <HI>Roman
Catholique Church,</HI> that look what the <HI>Roman Catholick Church</HI>
can do, the <HI>Pope</HI> can do with them, or without them: He
can call Councels, and make their Canons authenticall; He
can make Lawes to bind Conscience, he can make Lawes to
bind whole <HI>Churches,</HI> as well as the Aecumenicall power of
the whole Councell: He can forbid any other doctrine, or
worship, or government, but what himselfe establisheth: He
can adde to the Scriptures the <HI>Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crypha,</HI> and he hath infalli∣ble
power to judge Controversies: Hee can binde and loose
<PB N="244" REF="127"/>
Conscience; he can depose Kings, and dispose of their King∣doms,
and he can absolve Subjects from the oath of Fideli∣ty:
He hath power to pardon sinne, and to sell out pardons
to them that buy them. All that the first beast can do, he will
do, and more; but yet he doth it (as the Text sayes) <HI>in the
sight of the first beast;</HI> that is, <HI>in the face and countenance of the
first b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast;</HI> He is so modest, that he will not take all that ho∣nour
to the head, but the whole body, and derives all that
honour expresly to himself.</P>
<P><HI>The second act of his power,</HI> He causeth all that dwell on the
earth to worship the first beast.</P>
<P>The third act of his power; <HI>He doth great wonders, even to
call downe fire from Heaven in the sight of men.</HI> Not the fire of
Acceptance, which <HI>Eliah</HI> brought to consume the Sacrifice;
but the fire of Vengeance upon the Rebellious, as the Prophet
called for fire upon the Captains that came to attach him.</P>
<P>4. He doth by his miracles deceive all that dwell upon the earth.</P>
<P>5. <HI>He causeth them all to make an Image like unto the first beast.</HI>
The first beast (as you heard) was the <HI>Roman visible Catholicke
Church,</HI> then the image of the beast are all such like models
and forms of <HI>Churches</HI> as are <HI>Diocesan Churches, National Chur∣ches,</HI>
and <HI>Provinciall Churches.</HI></P>
<P>6. He causeth all men to worship that Image, that if any will
not worship that Image <HI>(Churches of that mold)</HI> they shall be
delivered to the secular power, and so they shall be killed.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> He will not suffer any Commerce, nor civil Commerce,
much lesse Ecclesiasticall communion, but to them that have the mark
of the beast, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name,
<HI>vers.</HI> 16, 17.</P>
<P>They must swear, or perform some loyalty to the Church
of <HI>Rome.</HI> The mark of the beast, the carriage of the beast in
the Originall: All that have received Religious Orders, have
received the mark of the beast, all their religious Orders leave
an indelible Character upon them, so that all that are entred
into religious Orders, are sworn <HI>Catholiques.</HI> The name of
the beast, what is it? Though they be not of the religious
Order, yet they professe themselves to be <HI>Roman Catholiques,</HI>
and professe subjection to the head of that <HI>Church,</HI> and so to
<PB N="245" REF="127"/>
his doctrine and worship, though it be be to Saints and An∣gels,
and to his government, as that which binds the con∣science,
the name of the Beast is a <HI>Roman Catholicke,</HI> submit∣ting
himselfe both to the <HI>Church,</HI> and to the head of that
<HI>Church,</HI> and that for conscience sake.</P>
<P>But for the number of his name, it was reserved to this
dayes exercise: Wheras the holy Ghost having said that he
would permit no man to buy or sell, but such as had received
the marke, or his name, or the number of his name; he doth
in this last Verse declare what this number of his name is,
which at least they must have, or else they cannot have com∣merce:
Now this number he first doth amplifie or illustrate,
and then expresse it.</P>
<P>He doth illustrate or amplifie it,</P>
<P>First, by the adjunct of wisdome needful for the understan∣ding
of it; <HI>Here is wisdome.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the duty of men that have understanding to
count it.</P>
<P>And thirdly, He doth amplifie it by the subject, or by the
efficient of it, <HI>It is the number of a man:</HI> This is his illustra∣tion:
It requires wisedome to count it: It is the duty
(though) of them that have understanding to search it out.
And when they do count it, they finde it the number of a
man.</P>
<P>In the Second place he doth expresly designe or discipher
out the number, and that is in the last word, <HI>his number is six
hundred threescore and six.</HI></P>
<P>The place is very obscure as any in the word, and therefore
the holy Ghost tels us, <HI>here is wisdome to finde it out:</HI> but
withal, here is a command that every one that hath received
the least measure or talent of wisdom should endeavour it,
and he doth incourage men to find it out.</P>
<P>But were it not that the Lord hath said, <HI>If any man want
wisdome let him aske it of God, and it shall be given him, James</HI> 1. 5.
And were it not that God hath given Christ to be our wise∣dome
to declare to us the whole councel of his Father, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>
1. 30. And were it not that the providence of God in the
<PB N="246" REF="128"/>
invitation of sundry brethren, hath put me upon the handling
of this book, and now it fals in order to be opened; for my
own part, I think I should never have chosen this Text to
have spoken to whilst I had lived: But now since we are
come to it, in our interpretation of this book, and the wis∣dome
of God is perfected in the weaknesse of his servants, I
shall therefore endeavour by the helpe of God, and by the
light of his wisdome, to expresse such meditations as God
hath suggested to men, and leave them to your further consi∣deration,
and spiritual discerning and judgement.</P>
<P>The note then is shortly thus much.</P>
<P>To finde out the number of the Beast requires heavenly wisdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctrine.</NOTE> and
yet such as have received any wisdome ought to count that number, and
upon the acount shall find it to be the number of a man, in sum six hun∣dred
threescore and six.</P>
<P>This is the sum, I wrap up all in one Doctrine, that hand∣ling
the Doctrine in the parcels, all the parts of the verse may
be opened therewith.</P>
<P>First, I say to finde out this number is wisdome, it requires
heavenly wisdome; <HI>Here is wisdome:</HI> And God accounts
not the wisdome of this world wisdome, but foolishnesse; he
speaks therefore of that which in Scripture language is wis∣dome,
not Mathematical, nor Airthmetical wisdome; for
what great wisdome would it require to count this number, it
ariseth out of six, and is multiplyed by ten, this is such wis∣dome
as any mean Arithmetition might count, six times ten
is 60. and ten times 60. is 600. and six times one is six, the
wisdome therefore lies not there. But to see how this count
disciphers the Beast, and by that means to give more perfect
intelligence of the Beast, and of his nature, then by his marke
and name alone could be gathered, that requires heavenly
wisdome, but wisdome therefore it doth require▪ It requires
a mans best understanding to enquire what the holy Ghost
hath said of this number: and though it require much wis∣dome,
yet the counting of this number is both possible, and
necessary: if it were not possible, the holy Ghost would not
say, <HI>Let him that hath understanding, count the number of the
Beast:</HI> Hee is wont to say, <HI>Let him that hath an eare, hear what
<PB N="247" REF="128"/>
the spirit saith:</HI> but here he saith, <HI>Let him tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath understan∣ding
count the number of the Beast.</HI> And it is also necessary for
him, not of necessity to salvation, <HI>without which a man cannot
be saved,</HI> but <HI>(necessitate precepti)</HI> necessary in regard of Gods
command: Now because there are none of Gods comman∣dements
that are vaine things, but weighty, therefore they are
either <HI>very necessary to salvation, or very expedient:</HI> so that a
man shall be much weakened in his spiritual progresse, (espe∣cially
in Popish times, or in such times where men live in the
Image of Popish Churches, National or Diocesan,) if he be
ignorant thereof, he shall finde it to be much expedient to
count the number of the Beast.</P>
<P>And further I adde, it will be found to be but <HI>the number of
a man:</HI> What is the meaning of that? I will not trouble you
with variety of interpretations, briefly the number of a man:
I suppose it is here opposed to that which ye read of in <HI>Rev.</HI>
21. 17. where he tels us, <HI>The new Jerusalem was measured, an
hundred and fourty and four cubits, according to the measure of a
man,</HI> that is of the Angel: here he doth not say so, <HI>the num∣ber
of a man,</HI> that is of the Angel: but it is the number of a
meere man, a carnal man, and therefote in sum this number
wil proove but an humane invention, it is therefore called <HI>the
number of a man.</HI></P>
<P>And finally, he saith this number is <HI>six hundred threescore and
six.</HI> Six hundred sixty six is not in the Original in so many
words, onely three greek letters are put for these three num∣bers,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Now it is true in the Greek account they do
reckon numbers by the letters of the Alphabet, and from the
first letter <HI>Alpha</HI> to <HI>Iota,</HI> they are for singular units, for <HI>Alpha</HI>
is one, and <HI>Beta</HI> is two, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they put in <HI>Sigma</HI> and make
that six, <HI>Iota</HI> is the tenth letter, and so is ten in number; and
from <HI>Iota</HI> to <HI>Rho,</HI> they are reckoned by tens, as <HI>Cappa</HI> is twen∣ty,
<HI>Lambda</HI> thirty, <HI>Mu</HI> fourty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so till you come to
<HI>Rho</HI> and that is one hundred, and then the rest that follow
are so many multiplied, as <HI>Sigma</HI> is two hundred, <HI>Tau</HI> three
hundred, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> six hundred. So that if these be under∣stood
as holding out the numbers, as here the words expresse,
then <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is six hundred, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is sixty, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is six; which being sum∣med
<PB N="248" REF="129"/>
together they make up six hundred sixty six.</P>
<P>Now a man would wonder that the holy Ghost should de∣light
in such Arithmetical riddles; but since it pleaseth him
thus to expresse himselfe, we must not look at it as a cabalis∣tical
curiosity, nor as an unsearchable mystery: but they
that labour herein, shall finde that which may solace them∣selves
and others: For though by the arme of flesh no man
shall be strong, yet by the wisdome of God the servants of
Christ shall see light, and babes shall see the mystery of it.
Therefore to cleare up this point, so far as God shall give
light, consider with me I pray you six or seven several obser∣vable
passages of the holy story of the <HI>Revel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> that may h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lp
us in some measure in enquiring and counting this sum of <HI>six
hundred three score and six,</HI> what it may point at. Let it not be
wearisome to you; for though to us that are Ministers, we
think we are most properly in our element when we preack
Christ, and the need of Christ; yet forasmuch as Antichrist is
opposed to Christ, and is an enemy to Christ, the one contra∣ry
may be the better known by the other, and no part of
Scripture but is worthy our consideration, we may not be so
squemish as to neglect to seek what may be the councel of the
holy Ghost in this point. Observe therefore what the Scrip∣ture
doth observe about this number.</P>
<P>First, you shall observe this, to finde out the meaning;
that such as have this number they all have liberty of com∣merce,
either in the Catholick Roman Church or in the I∣mage
of that Church; they may trade with them, whether in
spiritual or temporal businesses, they will not grudge you;
you are a currant market man among them; you are a ven∣dable
commodity, and you may passe with them, and your
mony is good silver, as in <HI>Verse</HI> 16, 17. But if you be not a
Preist of their order, nor a Roman Catholick, nor have
his number, you may not buy, nor sell; that is something
then.</P>
<P>Secondly, Marke this, that this number of the name is the
degree of commerce with the Roman Catholick Church, for
so he doth discend, <HI>Verse 17. No man may buy or sell but those
that have the marke, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his
<PB N="249" REF="129"/>
name:</HI> As who should say, they were of the lowest, they were
the least sort of them, yet to them it did pertaine that had
the number of the name: yet there is so much real difference
between them, that he saith plainly, <HI>They that receive the mark
or his name, they shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation: And
they shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the
holy Angels, and in presence of the Lamb: And the smoak of their
torment shall ascend up for ever and ever, and they shall have no rest
day nor night,</HI> Rev. 14. 9, 10, 11. Which shews if they conti∣nue
in it, they cannot be saved: There was a cry of the Angel
with a loud voyce, <HI>If any man worship the Beast and his Image,
and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, &amp;c.</HI> It shews
the danger is very great to receive the mark of the Beast or the
name of the Beast: But the number of his name I do not
read of any such judgement pronounced to be inflicted upon
them: though it be great wisdome to avoyd it, and it will
wonderfully advance their heavenly good to get free from
it: For wherein lies wisdome but in attaining our cheife
good, and to know the best means that leads to that good, &amp;
that is in communion with God in his Ordinances purely
dispenced; that is a second thing.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there is this recorded of this number of the name,
that the choicest christians and the best christians, they gave
God thanks for victory over the number as well as over the
Beast, <HI>Rev. 15. 2. They got victory over the Beast, and over his
Image, and over his marke, and over the number of his name, so that
they sung the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the
Lamb, saying, great and marvellous are thy works Lord God almighty,
&amp;c.</HI>
They had got the victory over the number of the name
of the Beast, and they are more abundant in thanksgiving for
deliverance, then they that had onely victory over the marke,
and that is their Preistly order or profession of Roman Ca∣tholick
Religion; so that this will come neare some Chur∣ches,
conformed to the Image of the Beast, that is, National,
Diocesan, or Cathedrall Churches; but these have got victo∣ry
over that, not onely over the Beast and his Image, and his
mark, and his name, but also the number of his name.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="130"/>
The fourth observable thing in Scripture is (I am occasi∣oned
to gather up little bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of wisdome which the holy
Ghost hath scattred that so we may gather up this account)
that this number of his name is not said to be the number of
his years; It is neither the number of his years when he be∣gan,
nor the number of his years when he shall end: They
cannot make it the beginning of his years; for though there
be some that thought that Antichrist did first arise to a name
in the year 606. yet they cannot cleare it by story. It is
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in 606. or rather 604. <HI>Boniface</HI> took upon him the title
of cheif Bishop, that is, spiritual advancing, which was a part
of Antichrist, yet Antichrist was begun; and 606 is not 666.
there is 60. years difference; and it is like the holy Ghost
would not have varied so much in such an expresse number,
therefore this number is not for the time of the beginning of
this beast. Neither is it the end of his years, for the beast
continues still to this time, which hath been almost a thou∣sand
years since 666. But some say in this round number,
something is omitted, as when we say 88. we mean 1588. yet
in Scripture phrase such small numbers are not regarded, we
speak to those that know what we speak.</P>
<P>But the Scripture requires us to use wisdome in finding
out this number: but what wisdome were it for the holy
Ghost to leave out a thousand, as we leave out when we say
88. for 1500. the holy Ghost doth not so here. And besides,
I would faine learn of any man of that judgement, what vi∣ctory
the Saints got, either the year when Antichrist began, or
when he shall end. What victory have we got? or shall no
body conflict with this number of the beast but those that li∣ved
in the year 666? or that shall live in the year 1666? In
<HI>Rev. 15. 2. They got victory over the Beast and his Image, and over
his name and number of his name, before the pouring out of the seven
vials;</HI> So that I cannot say this is the number of the period of
the beast, that those are the number of his name.</P>
<P>And for a fifth thing, there is this further to be observed in
it, that it is not the number of the followers of the beast, but
the number of the beast: If it were the number of his follow∣ers,
then it would be lesse then the number that followed the
<PB N="251" REF="130"/>
Lamb; for they are said to be <HI>an hundred fourty and four thou∣sand,</HI>
in <HI>Chap</HI> 14. 1. And had the beast had no more but 666.
then he had a lesse number to fight for him, then the Lamb
had to fight for him: but in <HI>Verse</HI> 8. of this chapter, he tels
you, <HI>All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
are not written in the Lambs book of life:</HI> And the world was
never so hapy, as to leave but 666. reprobates in it in any ge∣neration,
therefore that cannot be the meaning.</P>
<P>Sixthly, whereas he saith, this number is the number of a
man, and the number is <HI>six hundred threescore and six,</HI> he doth
apparently put a difference between that and the name of the
beast; for hee doth expresly distinguish them in the former
verse, for he saith, <HI>The marke of the Beast, and the name, and the
number of his name, Verse</HI> 17. They are three distinct things:
So in <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. 2. where he saith, <HI>They got victory over the beast
and his Image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name:</HI>
And more yet, expresly in <HI>Chap.</HI> 14. 9, 10, 11. He denouceth
vengence to them that receive his mark or name, and yet not
damnation to all that receive his number; so that the num∣ber
is not his name, it is a distinct thing from the name, as
the adjunct is from the subject. Then it will follow, me
thinks (but I referre it to men of better judgement) it cannot
be that either <HI>Latinus</HI> should be the number of the name, or
<HI>(Ecclesia Catholica)</HI> the Roman Catholick Church; yet upon
these points do our chief and late Expositers run: But (lea∣ving
them their due honour) it doth not satisfie me, because
<HI>Ecclesia Catholica</HI> is the name of the first beast; and the name is
one thing, and the number is another thing. And <HI>Latinus</HI> is
one of the names of the second beast, of <HI>Latinus Episcopus,</HI> the
name of the Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> therefore it being his name, it is
not the number of his name: So then all these things be con∣sidered,
these observations being laid down, attend to a se∣venth
observation for the clearing of the meaning of the text,
and for opening the true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it;</P>
<P>Observe this,</P>
<P>7. That this number is expresly opposite to the number of
the Lamb in the next <HI>verse,</HI> in the following <HI>Chapter:</HI> The
number of the <HI>Beast</HI> is one thing, and the number of the <HI>Lamb</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="131"/>
is another thing: For enough this be not the number of the
Beasts followers, <HI>sixe hundred threescore and sixe,</HI> yet it is the
number of the Beast; and the number of the Lambs followers
<HI>is an hundred forty &amp; foure thousand,</HI> what will that hold forth?
You shall find what the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> intends expresly in that
number in some other parts of this book, that this <HI>hundred
forty and foure thousand</HI> hath his originall and rise from 12.
And 12. multiplyed by 12. will arise from so many <HI>scores</HI> to
so many <HI>hundreds,</HI> and 12. times <HI>twelve-thousand</HI> is <HI>an hundred
forty and foure thousand.</HI> So that that is the number of <HI>an hun∣dred
forty and foure thousand,</HI> the basis of the number is 12. and
multiplyed by 12. it will still be derived into the same 12.
Now thus doth the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> lead us by the hand to consider
of more distinctly; In <HI>Rev</HI> 12. 14. 16. He tells us, <HI>The walls
of the City had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the
twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and the City lyeth foure-square, and
the length is as broad as the breadth, &amp;c.</HI> He measured the City
with the read, 12000. furlongs, the length, and the breadth,
and the height of it are equall. There he layes the number
according to the number of the 12. Apostles, the foundation
of the Church of the living God: And further, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k how he
multiplies on that 12. saith he, <HI>They are all equall, twelve thou∣sand
furlongs in breadth, twelve thousand furlongs in length, twelve
thousand furlongs in height:</HI> Which argueth still, that as the Ci∣ty
of the new <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is built upon them, so it is multi∣plyed
from them: And when he comes to measure the wall,
he tells you in <HI>vers.</HI> 17. that <HI>it was an hundred forty and foure:</HI>
Just the Lambs company; Still the whole Fabrick of <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI>
is 12. the foundation of the number is Apostolicall, it is
numbred by 12. and multiplyed by 12. It ariseth still but to
Apostolical simplicity, their number, and their measure, and
their order, in all their dementions; when you have sum∣med
it up to the highest, their Laws and Orders that they set
up, you shall finde 12. there, and you shall finde no more.
Now then what is the number of the Beast? You see what the
Lambs number is, <HI>An hundred forty and foure thousand:</HI> what is
the Beasts number? <HI>It is sixe hundred threescore and sixe,</HI> it falls
short in the beginning, sixe of the first 12. There is nothing
<PB N="253" REF="131"/>
Apostolical in it from the first rise: And as the rise is not the
Apostolicall number, and constitution, so neither is the mul∣tiplication
of it, for six is not multiplyed by 12. but by ten;
for sixe unites being multiplyed by tenne, make 60. and ten
times sixty is 600. So all the multiplications is by ten, not
by 12. the Apostolick number is not here. It is true, 666.
runs roundly, and hath a comely proportion in it; where e∣ver
ye look, ye have sixe, and it is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etty pleasing to the fan∣cy,
and easie to remember; 144. is not so round a number,
neither for apprehension, nor for memory. But yet wee are
not at the bottome: What should be the reason that the <HI>Holy
Ghost</HI> should fingle out the number sixe, and multiply it by
ten? why doth the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> put it upon sixe? Seven had bin
no Apostolical number, nor 10. multiplyed by 20. But why
doth the <HI>H. Ghost</HI> pitch upon sixe, and the multiplication of
sixe by ten? Why you that are conversant in the Latine Bible
look <HI>Junius</HI> his notes, and he tells you; whereas all the <HI>Ca∣tholique
Church</HI> was formerly governed by five books of De∣cretalls,
<HI>Boniface</HI> he did compile a sixth book of Decretalls,
and called it <HI>Sextus</HI> (you that have the book of Canons may
finde it) which being (said the Pope) a perfect number, and
therefore being added to the former books of Decretalls, it
maketh up a certain plat-form of direction for all matters of
practice and manners in the discipline of the Church, and so
it is a perfect number of all things to be done in the Church,
both for doctrine, worship, and government: so the Popes
Canons are summed up in his <HI>Sextus,</HI> there is the reason why
he makes sixe the foundation; all their Administrations are
founded and measured out from their Canon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Lawes, which
are all wrapped up in six volumes, and the sixth is the most
compleat of them all.</P>
<P>Now if you will aske why this sixe comes to be multiply∣ed
by ten? If ye observe it, all the government and mainte∣nance
of the <HI>Roman State</HI> is by tenths, by tithes; all the peo∣ple
must give the <HI>tenth</HI> to the Priest, and the Priest to the
Bishop for the mayntenance of the <HI>Catholicke Church,</HI> and so
the whole Government comes to be multiplyed, maintained,
and established.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="132"/>
Thus you see what the number is, and the reason why the
<HI>Holy Ghost</HI> calls it so, and how he doth oppose it to the con∣trary
number of that which is delivered by the blessed Apo∣stles,
and followed by the holy Saints of God from one ge∣neration
to another. Put then all these together, and all
will amount to this; That whereas the number of Christ up∣on
which both his followers are built, and his <HI>Church,</HI> and
all the Dimentions and Administrations of it: Their foun∣dation,
their gates, their <HI>length, heighth,</HI> and <HI>breadth,</HI> all of
them are founded in the Apostolicall doctrine: For <HI>Christ
prayed for his twelve Apostles, and all that should believe in his name
through their word,</HI> John 17. 20. It is the comprehension of
all Saints to the end of the world, whereas they are built up∣on
Apostolicall simplicity, both for their <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Church-administrations,</HI>
they are all built upon <HI>twelve,</HI> and multiplyed
and enlarged by 12.</P>
<P>On the contrary, all the <HI>Roman Catholickes</HI> they are built
upon the Popish Lawes and Decrees, all which require sub∣jection
to the Popish Church, and submission to that <HI>Church,</HI>
and to the Pope as the head of that <HI>Church,</HI> receiving do∣ctrine,
and worship, and discipline from that <HI>Church,</HI> and
that was founded in sixe, on the sixe books of their Decrees,
and it is multiplyed according to the same books, to mayn∣tayn
all the Clergy, from the Pope to the lowest Parish priest:
And it is wisdome to find this out, and it requires heavenly
wisdome to see the dangerous state of this, and yet they that
have wisdome may finde this out; and when they search it
out, <HI>They will finde it but the number of a man, not of the Angel,
or of the Apostles, or of any messenger of God.</HI></P>
<P>I remember the speech of one of the Saints of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parker.</NOTE> That it
is a most unworthy thing that the Church of Christ should be
governed by the Lawes of <HI>Antichrist</HI> (and such were all their
sixe books) and it is most unworthy, that both the Church
it selfe, and all the Images of it, that they are all governed by
these sixe bookes; and it is most unworthy that Antichrist
should govern all the Administrations of the Church; that
if a man be cited, it shall be by a Latine writ; and if he ap∣peare,
he shall be proceeded against according to Canon
<PB N="255" REF="132"/>
Lawes; and if he be censured, it shall be a Canon Law, and in
<HI>Latine,</HI> and so shall his Absolution be; and what pertayns to
their whole government, it is but founded in these sixe books
of Decretals, and count them, and you shall find them but the
number of a man; nothing but meerly the wit and policy of
men, either to keep unity as they say (but tyranny in govern∣ment)
or to enrich men with fees, or maintayne the honour
of some Cathedrall person, it is all but meer humane inven∣tion.
Now for a man to see not only the <HI>Roman Catholicke
visible Church</HI> to be a Beast, but that the Pope the head of it is a
beast, and the image of that Church is a beast; Diocesan, Pro∣vinciall,
Nationall, and Metropolitan Churches are but ima∣ges
of this great beast, and to see all the numbers and rights
they thrust upon the Church by Canons, they are but the
number of the beast, the number of a man, humane inventi∣ons;
what is appointed by the Church, whether Crosse or
Surplice, or kneeling at the Sacrament, they are but the mul∣tiplication
of Canons, Canon multiplyed on Canon, but it
is still but the power of the Canon, this is great wisdome to
find it out: And it behooves those that have wisdome to con∣sider
it; and they that consider it, shall find it but a meer hu∣mane
device, one as well as another; and they will consider
which way the <HI>State</HI> goes, and which way the <HI>State</HI> leanes:
Though some poor hearts think they are bound to obey the
Lawes of the Kingdom, and some good souls many times will
be tampering with them too much; but he that shall observe
it, shall find it but the number of a man when he doth find it:
He shall find thus much, that if he do believe as God is wont
to teach to his people, they shall not have the liberty of Com∣merce
in buying and selling, nor leave in spirituall or tem∣porall
occurrances and dealings with them.</P>
<P>For the use of it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 1.</NOTE> First, let it be some word of encourage∣ment
and comfort unto all the servants of God, that have got
the victory over this number, though with their losse, not to
look at their losses as an unexpected thing, or new matter,
but prophecyed of above 1500. years agone. <HI>John</HI> wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of
it in his time, what you lost in your liberties in the Church
wherein you lived, it is no more then what the Lord foretold
<PB N="256" REF="133"/>
you, that you should not have liberty to buy and sell if you
did beare witnesse against the beast, and his mark, and name,
and number of his name; then there is no abiding for you in
any Church in <HI>Christendome,</HI> which is either <HI>Catholicke,</HI> or fra∣med
after the image of it, as Nationall, Diocesan, or Cathe∣dral,
or Provincial, it is not possible you should get the vict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣over
these things, and have liberty of commerce. It is not e∣nough
that we have cast off the Pope: and what is an image
of Popery (which we sometimes have submitted unto) and
have born against it, and it is not enough to abhor the name
of a Papist so far as we have been corrupted: It is well that ye
have born witnesse against the Hierarchy and the papall go∣vernment;
but may we not hearken to the Canon of the
Church maintained by a whole National Councel? and may
we not yield to the orders of these Canons, and beare wit∣nesse
to the number of the Name? Suppose the Cross, or Sur∣plice,
or kneeling at the the Sacrament, many Christians have
strong reasonings about this, that they may keep their liber∣ty
of Commerce, their buying and selling, and <HI>will not God
have mercy and not sacrifice?</HI></P>
<P>Though such Godly christians in their weaknesse have such
reasonings, yet beleive it we are to blesse God that hath given
us to see that there is no correspondency to be kept with
<HI>Rome:</HI> If you have the number of his name, this is not that
which the holy Ghost speaks of as damnable heresie, you may
live and dye in that judgment, and be saved, therefore he doth
not pronounce fire and brimstone to such; they think in con∣science
they may yeild to this and that, as being the command
of <HI>Caesar,</HI> or of the Church; <HI>the Lord spare you</HI> as the Apostle
saith; But if a man will adore the Roman Catholick Church
or the Pope the head of it, and submit in conscience to be
guided by their Laws, he renounces his salvation in such a
case; that a man shall pin his faith upon the Churches sleeve,
and his hope, and Government, and course of life on the
Churches sleeve, this is the way to everlasting damnation:
And therefore in those Churches that are even Images of An∣tichrist,
it pleaseth God to keep his servants so far, that they
dare not take all their Laws for doctrine without question,
<PB N="257" REF="133"/>
nor all the ways of their Government as the Government of
Christ, that God opens all the hearts of his faithful servants
to see: But yet for the number of his name; It is (say they)
but a few trifling things, they are made a matter of six, as
Crosse, and Surplice, and kneeling at the Sacrament, and bow∣ing
to Altars, and the name of Jesus, and ye will have six in
the end, and what will be multiplyed on that six, the Lord
knows: But for you here, look at it as a special mercy, that
you see the vanity of receiving the number of his name, and
that you have this deliverance from it; that though you have
lost your buying and selling, that if you were there, you
might hardly be seen in the Market, and in many of those
Churches you will hardly be allowed, yet you have lost no
more then ought to be forsaken.</P>
<P>There are that have sometimes put X for the crosse, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a
long letter in wrinkles for the Surplice, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for the propor∣tion
of a man bowing, but I would not limit the counsell of
the holy Ghost so strictly: But take all that is numbred by
their Canon Law, and it will come all to one reckoning;
they are but the number of the beast, whether the Pope dictate
them, or they receive them; and though they cut of his head
for saith, yet for discipline, and order, and circumstances they
still retaine him, and these are the number of the Beast; there∣fore
blesse the Lord that hath shewed you these to be evils, and
saved you from such prevailing evils.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 2.</NOTE> for your present condition, learn thus much,
It will not be safe for ye to receive the Image of any other
Church, then that which Christ hath established, and this is
grounded upon 12. upon the Apostles doctrine, and multi∣plyed
by 12. increased with the increasings of God, blessed be
his name, therefore it being so, hold fast this forme, and be
not removed from it: If you fall to adore National, or Dio∣cessan,
or Provincial, or Cathedral Church-government, then
you will fall to number by 6. and multiply 6. by 10. in the
end it will come to passe all this shall be maintained by tenths,
such setled endowments and preserments, and then it may be
you shall have liberty of buying and selling, of traffique
and trading; the Beast of <HI>Rome</HI> will allow you some liberty
<PB N="258" REF="134"/>
that way; yet believe it, it is a special part of your wisdome
to know this, and the danger of it. If a man in his ignorance
shall yeild to these things, God will pardon it; but if a man
know these things, and willingly give way to them, the Lord
will require it at his hands: Consider therefore this number,
and avoyd it, though it cost you all your liberties, the Lord
will say, <HI>this onely is a wise people,</HI> that renounce not onely the
Beast, but the Images of him, and his marke, and the name
<HI>Catholick,</HI> and <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> and conformity to all the
number of his name; If ye establish your hearts in these spi∣ritual
resolutions, here is wisdome; and thereof how should
it provoke the hearts of Gods people to be setled in consci∣ence
about such points as these, though it may be your coun∣trey-men
will count you fools in runing such desperate ven∣tures,
that you would hazard your fortunes, and at length
bring a noble to nine pence; you shall bring your six hun∣dreds
to sixties, and your sixties to sixe: No matter what
they think of it, so long as ye shall keep the Apostolical num∣ber,
and multiply by their rule; the holy Ghost saith, <HI>Here is
wisdome, and he that hath understanding, let him so esteem that here
is wisdome;</HI> and it was wisdome to come hither: and he that
came for this end, never made a better bargaine in his life,
then to come over for this, because he would have no more to
do with the Beast, and his Image, and his name, and the num∣ber
of his name; I say thou hast made a wise bargaine, if thou
wilt take the word of the holy Ghost for thy security; he
saith, <HI>here is wisdome.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 3.</NOTE> it may teach us that are come hither to see that
the Lord acknowledgeth our wisdome in the abrenuntiation
which we have made from these inventions of the sonnes of
men: The Lord did foretel us what should be our case, we
should not have liberty to buy nor sell, neither be seen in
Church nor Market, and he counts it wisdome to remoove on
these termes: but if we shall have flittering mindes to go
back againe, the Lord will write upon it, <HI>here is a foole, this
their way is their folly, Psal.</HI> 49 13. When men in their hearts
wax weary of the Churches of Christ, and of the discipline of
Christ, and look at them as fulsome and empty things for
<PB N="259" REF="134"/>
want of feeling the life of Christ, and wisdome of Christ, run
on foolishly and preposterously, and truly take a course to o∣verthrow
their communion they have with Christ, and make
shipwrack as much as in them lies of all that which they have
undergone, of all our sufferings and tryals: Saith the Apo∣stle
to the elect Lady and her children, in 2 <HI>John 8. Look to your
selves, that ye loose not those things which ye have wrought but that
ye receive a full reward.</HI> That as you have made a wise bargain
and a safe, &amp; bin at so much charge, and have been freed from
the image of Antichrist, and the remnant of his image, and the
remnant of his number (we have cause to blesse God for it.)</P>
<P>And though we may think of mending our selves here or
there, yet you will finde it a difficult thing to finde 12. multi∣plyed
by 12. in any place under Heaven, that is, either your
foundation shall not be Apostolical institution, or your ad∣ministration
apostolick doctrine: That christians should be
the foundation of Churches, as the Apostles require, Saints
by calling, and to build on such, and to administer such ac∣cording
to the word of God: Yea though the Lord should
be pleased to give our Countrey-men free passage of a Parlia∣ment,
(as now we have speech of it) and though they be a
wise Nation, yet such is the very frame of the State, and of the
Sonnes of men, that if the Lord give free passage of a Parlia∣ment,
you will find it a very difficult thing, to have the State
ruled by Apostolical judgment, to reject all devices of men, to
shut out the greatest part of a kingdom from the Lords Table,
you would finde rebellions multiplyed exceedingly, if they
were of the spirit that they were of in <HI>Edward</HI> the sixths time.
And when you are gone out of the Countrey (not that I
would flatter the Countrey, the Lord knows we our selves
here, have need to grow more spiritual daily; but yet in re∣spect
of the Churches of God, and administration of things
here, though we faile and go aside, we have the rule to shew us
the way back againe:) I say when you are gone, go whe∣ther
you will, you will have much ado to finde materials, and
more ado to finde forme and administration: as that it may
be in cold blood, you will fit and mourn by the waters of <HI>Ba∣bilon,</HI>
and hang your Harpes upon the willowes, and say, <HI>how
<PB N="260" REF="135"/>
shall we sing the Lords song, the song of Zion in a strange La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d?</HI>
Therefore let it provoke us to hold fast what we have received
and not to be taken off with faire pretences, to turne aside to
one hand or the other; if we be in a state of wisdome, let us
keep in it, and beleive it, whatever takes you to a contrary
course to things as they stand; if the holy Ghost say this
is wisedome, then I am sure the contrary of it must needs be
folly.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋse 4.</NOTE> it may teach us (in the fear of God) to have an
eye to our brethren in our native Country, to consider those
defects that those which reformed religion before us did leave
in the recovery of the Country out of the jaws of Antichrist;
(you see what the Lord requires of us, that we should have
nothing to do with the number of the Beast) Though they
cut off the head of the Beast, from being of any soveraign po∣wer
to them, yet they took too much liberty for forme of
worship, and for the number of the Popes name, and of Go∣vernment
by Canon Laws, yea the whole Church discipline
by the Popish Canon Law, onely with this destinction, that
whereas the Pope enjoyed it before, now the King he claims
headship over the Church aswel as the civil State, and he deri∣veth
the Church-power to the chief Bishops, and they worke
upon it more and more; and though it be true, both <HI>Henery</HI>
the eighth, and much more <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI>
all these did set so many Councellors, so many Di∣vines,
and so many common and civil Lawyers to cull out of
the Popes Decretals such Canons as were most fit for Govern∣ment,
and most of such as cut off Popish supremacy, yet they
could never agree of it, and so they admit them as the Popes
Canons only; yet so that whereas reference of Ecclesiastical
matters was to the Pope, now it is to the King as supream
head and Governour, but the Popes Canons are the govern∣ment
of the Church. Now what was the reason? There was
an unsafe principle in their hearts, that they thought it law∣full
to take the Laws of the Roman Church, and that any
King might have power to make Laws to govern the Church,
as well as the Pope had. It is true, he hath power to make
Lawes as well as the Pope had, and better; but the truth is,
<PB N="261" REF="135"/>
neither the Pope, nor King hath power to make Laws to rule
the Church, but it must be by the Laws of Christ.</P>
<P>Whatsoever is not of the number of 12. is superadded, and
will never prosper; but this principle making them willing
to admit such things, though they were the chiefest of the
Kingdome, that were appointed for that worke, yet they could
never agree: But had they received a little more light and
wisdome to cut off the number of the Beast aswel as his head,
it would have prevailed for the liberty of Gods Ordinances
and purity of Doctrine: I say this being wanting to them,
let it not be wanting to us; but through the mercy of God,
the servants of God have taken no small paines to clear up
such things; what the Laws are in the Church of Christ by
which Magistrates and others are to be guided, how far civil
Government may reach, and how farre it may not go, still re∣serving
this fundamental principle, to hold them close to the
direction of the holy Ghost by the 12. Apostles; and this be∣ing
the pious care of our Magistrates, and of the Churches,
this wisdome will by the blessing of God be established; that
that which other Nations have not attained to this day, may
by the blessing of God be reached by us: and yet though the
Elders are to enquire and to commend to them such rules as
may establish it, it pleaseth God not to give as yet passage to
our purposes; appoint one day, a storme of raine hinders; ap∣point
the second day fortnight, then a storme of snow pre∣vents,
that it is tough work to establish things of this nature;
it is difficult, as if the Lord would have them established in a
spirituall way, as <HI>Moses</HI> the Law by 40. dayes fasting, he had
the spirit of God and larger measure by much then we, yet
the Lord requires serious humiliation of him. And there∣fore
since I heard that there hath been a seasonable motion to
commend such a thing to the State that the whole country
do in special maner seek God at such a time against the con∣sultation
of the general Court; and this weighty point fal∣ling
in for ripening of mens thoughts for the Laws of the
Country and limitation of jurisdictions both of Church and
Common-wealth, the Lord saith, <HI>he will be sought unto by the
house of Israel.</HI> Therefore I think the motion is seasonable
<PB N="262" REF="136"/>
and was glad to hear of it; and thought to commend it to our
honoured Governours that sit at <HI>Stern,</HI> and all other Chur∣ches
(but we that are present have no power but in our own
Church, nor that but with the consent of the Church) that if
it be thought convenient this day seven-night might be set a∣part
to seek the face of God, that we may take time both to
ripen our consultations, and to prevaile with the Lord to
prosper our consultations and administrations, that this mat∣ter
which so much concerns posterity may be established;
for my own part, while we live I am not greatly solicitous
thereabout, yet for future we know not what Governors may
arise, and what may be put upon our posterity; needful there∣fore
that things were put in a right frame, that whatever
men say, yet the Lord may say here is wisdome, and here is
neither marke, nor name, nor number of name, but all carri∣ed
according to the laws of the 12. Apostles, and this will re∣quire
some humiliation, and if <HI>Moses</HI> stood in need of 40.
days, we much more of one day. And for our native coun∣trey,
we do not know what conflicts there may be there about
the number of the name of the Beast; we are come from them
in bodily presence, and therefore cannot helpe them by a
word of advice; but this we may do, put up supplications to
heaven, and we may intreat the God of wisdome, and the
Prince of peace, that he would put in amongst them that they
may see the whole fabrick, root and branch of the man of sin,
that so there may be a perfect combination of the two great
Nations, that the Parliament may be for the better, not for
the worse, but purity of ordinances (if it be the blessed will
of God) may be established; however we shall finde a blessing,
and some of our brethren shall fare the better: and if things
wax clearer and zeal warmer▪ they will begin to suspect the
number as well as the name, and as the head of the beast; o∣therwise
the three innocent ceremonies (as they call them)
they are grown to six; and being multiplyed by ten, they may
grow to 60. yea to 600. for ought I know: Let us help them
what we can by Prayer.</P>
