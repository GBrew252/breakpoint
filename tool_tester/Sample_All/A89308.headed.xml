<HEAD>TO
The Honourable William Lenthal <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
Speaker of the Honourable House of Commons.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Truly Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving received a command from
the honourable Committee of
both Kingdomes to take charge
of a Brigade of horse and foot,
drawn out of the Garisons of <HI>Glo∣cester,
Hereford</HI> &amp; <HI>Evesham,</HI> to prevent the Lord
<HI>Ashleys</HI> conjunction with the Kings forces at
<HI>Oxford;</HI> and to effect that designe I drew forth
&amp; rendezvouzed seasonably betwixt Evesham
and Warwick, notwithstanding the Lord <HI>Ash∣ley</HI>
endeavoured by all wayes to get by me,
which much foiled my Brigade to prevent in
marching from place to place to secure the
Fords upon the river <HI>Avon:</HI> yet after some
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
considerations perceived that he was unwil∣ling
to passe over so long as I lay near the ri∣ver,
resolved upon Thursday last to draw off
and to quarter at Cambdin, the most conve∣nient
place wheresoever he made his passage,
and that night had intelligence of his march
from Droitwich near Worcester, towards
Bitford, three miles from Evesham; whereof
I presently advertised Colonel <HI>Walley</HI> and Co∣lonel
<HI>Fleetwood,</HI> and sent post to Sir <HI>William
Brereton,</HI> to desire the assistance of his Horse,
which was accordingly granted. But upon
Friday the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> still continuing his
march (and Sir <HI>William Breretons</HI> horse not
come up) was forced to hold him in action for
the space of four hours, skirmishing with him
by parties, and keeping my Body drawn up
in a most advantagious place for pursuit, in
case he should passe by me (before Sir <HI>William
Brereton</HI> came up) which about nine a clock
that night he did: whereupon I resolved to
pursue, thinking it more advantagious to fol∣low
upon his rear, then at that time to draw
out to meet him in the field; and in my pursuit
Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> came up with 800 horse,
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
(of whom I desired to receive orders, but he
referred the whole command of the field to
me) then being equall in number to the Lord
<HI>Ashleys</HI> forces consisting of 3000, I comman∣ded
400 horse and 200 firelocks to charge
home his Rear guard, to put him to a stand
before he should passe through Stow upon the
Wold (and as my intelligence informed me,
the King was to have joyned with him with∣in
seven miles of that place) where he made
choice of his ground and had the wind with
him: yet trusting in God I drew up and char∣ged
him home (halfe an hour before day upon
Saturday morning) put him to a totall rout,
killed many Gentlemen and Officers of quali∣ty,
took prisoners the Lord <HI>Ashley,</HI> and all his
Foot officers, whose names are in the inclosed
List, besides 1600 common Souldiers; where∣of
many of them being wounded, I gave them
liberty to go to their own homes, (taking the
oath of the 5 of <HI>April)</HI> the rest are now sent
to Glocester. I took also 2000 armes and all
their ammunition. Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> desi∣red
that the Lord <HI>Ashley</HI> might be his prisoner,
which I willingly condescended unto; not
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
doubting but he will give a good account of
him to the Parliament. This good successe,
(the glory whereof I desire may be given unto
God) will prevent the King from drawing an
army into the field which he expected, and am
now marched towards Worcester; where <HI>I</HI>
shall observe such orders as shall come from
the honourable house of Parliament, or the
Committee of both Kingdomes; and in the
mean time shall endeavour to make use of all
opportunities to weaken the Enemy, and to
advance the publick service. The honourable
House was pleased to promise a summe of mo∣ney
to this Brigade, which <HI>I</HI> hope you will
be pleased to hasten down, that thereby Free
Quarters may be prevented, and <HI>I</HI> enabled to
prevent the disorders of the Souldiers in the
countrey; which shall alwayes be the desire
of him who will ever subscribe himself to be</P>
