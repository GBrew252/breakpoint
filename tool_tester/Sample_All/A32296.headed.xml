<DIV2 TYPE="case">
<HEAD><HI>The Case of the City of</HI> London <HI>con∣cerning</HI> Neusans <HI>in stopping up the lights of their Neighbours Houses by New-buildings.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>REginold Hughs</HI> an Attorney of the Kings Bench being seized in his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trinterm. 7. Jac. Rex Rot. 1490.</NOTE> demesne as of Fee, of an ancient house
<PB N="2" REF="6" MS="y"/>
in the Parish of Saint <HI>Olaves</HI> in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings-Bench. The pleading of this case see in the New-Book of entries fol. 20 &amp; 21.</NOTE> Ward of <HI>Queen Hithe London</HI> in the <HI>South-Part</HI> of which House have been three ancient Lights (time our of mind.) <HI>Anthony Keeme</HI> having taken a Lease for 31. years from the Rector and Guar∣dians of the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> at <HI>Queen Hithe</HI> by Indenture of a rumous house, and yard next adjoyn∣ing unto the said House, with a Cove∣nant to bestow a 100 marks at the least upon the repairing or new building of the said House; doth within two years pull down the said House, and doth build a new House in the place where the old House stood, and likewise upon the yard whereby the three ancient Lights on the South-side of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> House are stopt up, whereupon <HI>Reynold Lewes</HI> doth bring his action upon the case against <HI>Anthony Keem,</HI> for the stopping up the Lights; unto which the said <HI>Anthony</HI> doth plead a special Plea in Bar, shewing the ruinousness of the House, and like∣wise the Lease made by the Rector and Guardians, and the Covenant comprised within the Lease, and doth also shew that there is a custom in <HI>London,</HI> that if one have an ancient house, wherein there are
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
ancient Lights, and one other hath a House adjoyning upon that House; he that hath the adjoyning House may well enough enhance his House, or build a new House upon his ground, and to stop those ancient Lights of the House next adjoyning, unless there be some writing to the contrary. And he doth aver <HI>in facto,</HI> that there was no writing to the contrary, and that he according to the Custome did take down the old House and build a new one upon the same Foundation and upon the Yard opposite unto the said Lights, whereby they were stopped up; and upon this Plea in Bar; the Plaintiff demurreth in Law.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="questions">
<HEAD>The Questions of this case are.</HEAD>
<P>First, whether it be lawful for a man to build a House upon his own Ground, whereby the Lights of an ancient House are stopped, there being no Custome to enable him?</P>
<P>Secondly, whether the Custome of <HI>London</HI> will enable a man to build a new house from the ground; where no house formerly was, whereby he may stop the
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
ancient lights of his Neighbours house?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Whether upon an ancient foundation a house may lawfully be en∣hansed, so as it shall stop up the light of the Neighbours house adjoyning?</P>
<P>As to the first, it is clear by the opi∣nion <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 1.</NOTE> of Sir <HI>Thomas Flemming,</HI> Chief Ju∣stice of the Kings Bench, Sir <HI>Cristopher Yelverton,</HI> Sir <HI>David Williams,</HI> and Sir <HI>Iohn Crook,</HI> Justices of the Kings Bench, that there being no custome, it is not lawful to erect a new house upon a void piece of ground, whereby the old lights of an ancient house may be stop∣ped up; for the rule of equity, and law saith, <HI>Utere tuo, ut alienum non laedas;</HI> and the light which cometh in by the Win∣dowes, being an essential part of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three commodi∣ties of lights by a Window, Air by Health, light by profit, pleasure by pro∣spect.</NOTE> House, by which he hath three great commodities, that is to say, Air for his Health, Light for his profit, prospect for his pleasure, may not be taken away no more, then a part of his House may be pulled down, whereby to erect the next House adjoyning. And with this resolu∣tion agreeth the Case of <HI>Eldred</HI> report∣ed by Sir <HI>Edw. Cook,</HI> in his Ninth Re∣port, <HI>fol.</HI> 58. where he sheweth the an∣cient <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cook</HI> 9. Rep. <HI>El∣dred</HI> case.</NOTE> form of the Action upon the
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
case to be <HI>quod messuagium horrida tene∣britate obscuratum fuit;</HI> but if there be hinderance only of the prospect by the new erected House, and not of the Air, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide, Ho∣barts</HI> Re∣ports, <HI>Ro∣bins</HI> of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns.</HI> 131.</NOTE> not of the light, then an Action of the case will not lye, insomuch that the pro∣spect is only a matter of delight, and not of necessity.</P>
<P>As to the second, it was resolved by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 2.</NOTE> the opinion of the aforesaid Judges, that the custome of <HI>London</HI> will not en∣able a man to erect a new House upon a void space of ground, whereby the ancients lights of an old house are stopt up; for first the owner of the old house having possession of a lawful easment and profit which hath been belonging unto the house by prescription, time out of mind of man, may not be prescrib∣ed out of it by another <HI>thwarting</HI> cu∣stome which hath been used time out of mind of man, but the latter custome shall rather be adjudged to be void, and Prescription against a Prescription will never be allowed by the Law. 2. It may well be that before time of memory the owner of the said void piece of ground granted unto the owner of the House, to have his Windows that way without
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
any stopping of them, the which being done, and continued accordingly, hath begotten a prescription, the which may not be defeated by the Allegation of a general custome; and with this resolu∣tion doth agree a case adjudged, <HI>Trin.</HI> 29. <HI>Eliz. Rot.</HI> 253. in the Kings Bench; whereupon an action upon the case brought by <HI>Thomas Bloond</HI> against <HI>Thomas Mosley,</HI> for erecting of a House in the County of the City of <HI>York,</HI> whereby the ancient lights of his House were stopped up: The Desendant did plead a Custome for the City of <HI>York,</HI> as there is here for the City of <HI>London,</HI> and adjudged that the Custome was naught, whereupon the Plaintiff had his Judgement: But if the Houses had been new erected Houses, or otherwise Windowes had been newly made Win∣dows in that ancient House, the erecti∣on of that new House upon that void space of Ground would have been law∣ful notwithstanding that the Windows and Lights be stopped up; for it shall not lie in the power of the owner of the ancient House by setting out his new Windows to prevent him, that hath the void peice of Ground from making the best benefit of it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
As to the third point, it was conceived that if the new house be only erected <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. <HI>Quest.</HI> A new house built upon an old foundati∣on, with∣out en∣largement either in longitude or lati∣tude, though never so high built, shall not be taken to preju∣dice the Neigh∣bour.</NOTE> upon the ancient foundation, without any inlargement either in Longitude or Latitude, howsoever it be made so high that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oppeth up the lights of the old house yet he is not subject unto any action, because the law authorizeth a man to build as high as he may upon an ancient Foundation, and it is no reason to foreclose a man from making his house convenient unto his estate and de∣gree by building up higher, when there is no other impediment, but only some windowes which are built out over his house; and agreeing to this, seemeth the old book of 4. <HI>E.</HI> 3. 150. to be where an Assize of Nusans was brought for e∣recting his house so high, that the light of the Plaintiff in the next adjoyning house was disturbed by it, and the Plain∣tiff upon the opinion of <HI>Herl,</HI> Chief Ju∣stice, did not proceed in the Assize, but let it fall to the ground; but if the new builded house exceeded the ancient foundation, whereby that excess is the cause of stopping up of lights, then is he subject unto the action of him whose light is stopped up, as it may appear by
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
22. <HI>H.</HI> 6. 25. And in the case at the Bar, Judgement was given for the Plaintiff, because he had brought his action for building of a new House upon a void piece of ground, by which his Windows were stopt up. And <HI>Keeme</HI> the Defendant only justifieth by the Custome, the ere∣ction of the House upon an old Founda∣tion, and upon the void piece of ground, the which is not any answer at all unto that which the Plaintiff layeth unto the charge of the Defendant.</P>

<HEAD>Touching the Custome of Citizens leaving that Trade whereunto they have been Apprentices seven years, and betaking themselves to other Trades.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IOhn Tolley</HI> having been an Apprentice <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hill.</HI> 12. <HI>Jac. in Banco</HI> Rep.</NOTE> in <HI>London</HI> by the space of seven years unto a <HI>Wool-Packer,</HI> after the seven years expired, is made a Freeman of <HI>London;</HI> afterwards he leaveth the Trade of a <HI>Wool-Packer,</HI> and betaketh himself to the Trade of an <HI>Vpholster,</HI> and doth exercise that Trade by many years, whereupon one <HI>Thomas Allen</HI> an In∣former, doth exhibit an Information in the Court of the Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> as well for the King as for himself, upon the branch of the Statute made in the fifth year of the late Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Informa∣tion upon the Stat. of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> 4. concern∣ing Ma∣nualoccu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>cap.</HI> 4. whereby it is enacted, <HI>That after the first day of</HI> May <HI>next ensuing it shall not be lawful unto any person or persons, other than such as now do lawfully use, or exercise any art, Mystery, or manual oc∣cupation, to set up,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>any such occupation</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<HI>now used or occupied within the Realm of</HI> England, <HI>or</HI> Wales, <HI>except he shall have been brought up seven years at the least as an Apprentice in manner and form afore∣said, nor to set any person on work in such Mystery, Art, or Occupation, being not a Workman at this day, except he shall have been an Apprentice as aforesaid, or else having served as an Apprentice as is aforesaid, shall or will become a Iourney-man or hired by the year upon pain that every person willingly offending or doing the contrary, shall forfeit and lose for eve∣ry default fourty shillings for every moneth.</HI> And he sheweth, that <HI>Iohn Tolly</HI> the now Defendant hath exercised the trade of an <HI>Upholster</HI> by the space of fourty moneths, whereas he was never an Ap∣prentice to that trade by the space of seven years; contrary unto the aforesaid Statute, whereby the said <HI>Thomas Allen</HI> doth demand the forfeiture of eighty pound unto the King and himself, where∣of he the said <HI>Allen</HI> doth require the one moyety, according to the form of the said Statute. And this Information <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cu∣stome of L pleaded in Bar</NOTE> being removed out of the Court of the Mayor of <HI>London</HI> by <HI>Certiorari</HI> into the Kings Bench, the said <HI>Iohn Tolley</HI> doth
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
plead a special Plea in Bar, shewing, that there is a custome of <HI>London</HI> which hath been used time out of mind of man, <HI>That every Citizen and Freeman of</HI> London, <HI>which hath been an Appre∣tice in</HI> London <HI>unto any trade by the space of seven years, may lawfully and well re∣linquish that trade, and exercise any other trade at his will and pleasure.</HI> And shew∣eth further, <HI>That all the Customes of</HI> London <HI>were confirmed by K.</HI> R. 2. <HI>in the Parliament holden in the seventh year of his Raign.</HI> And averteth, That he had served one in the Trade of a <HI>Wool-Packer,</HI> as an Apprentice, by the space of seven years, and that he was a Citi∣zen and a Freeman of <HI>London,</HI> and that he did relinquish the trade of a <HI>Wool-Packer,</HI> and betook himself to the trade of an <HI>Upholster,</HI> as lawful it was for him to do; and so he demandeth the Judgment of the Court if this Infor∣mation against him will lie; and upon this Plea in Bar, the said <HI>Thomas Allen</HI> doth demur in Law.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="questions">
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>The Questions in the Case were these.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Whether the custome of relinquish∣ing one Trade, after that he hath been an Apprentice by the space of seven∣years, and betaking himself to another Trade, wherein he hath not been an Ap∣prentice, be good or no?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether it may be taken as a cu∣stome or no, or whether it shall be said to be the Common Law of the Realm, and so the Allegation of it, as a custome, nought?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether the Statute of the Con∣firmation of the <HI>Customes of London,</HI> made in the seventh of <HI>R.</HI> 2. as it is plead∣ed, shall be taken to be an Act of Par∣liament, or only a Confirmation made by the Letters Pattents of the King in Parliament?</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether the branch of the statute of 5. <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 4. being in the Nega∣tive, inhibit all men to exercise the trade when they have not been Apprentice seven years thereunto, is a Control∣ment of the custome of <HI>London,</HI> which can receive no support by the Statute of confirmations? and whether that custom
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
shall stand good in opposition of that branch?</P>
<P N="5">5. Whether the trade of an <HI>Vpholstor</HI> be a Trade restrained by the Statute of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> so as <HI>Iohn Tolley</HI> may exercise it, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 1.</NOTE> notwithstanding that he hath not been an Apprentice to it by the space of seven years, according to the course of the Common Law?</P>
<P N="6">6. Whether the Court of the Mayor of <HI>London</HI> be such a Court of Record, as that an Information may be exhibited there?</P>
<P N="7">7. Whether a Moyety may be de∣manded of this Forfeiture by the In∣former, when as a Proviso in the Stat. of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> 4. doth appoint the levying, gathering, and receiving of such For∣feiture as falls in a City or Town Cor∣porate to the Mayor, or other head Of∣ficers, to the use and maintenance of the same City or Town Corporate?</P>
<P>As to the first Question, Which is the lawfulness of the custome, it was agreed to be good; for it might have a reasonable construction, beginning, and just cause, for the putting of it in Execution, insomuch that <HI>London</HI> being a famous City for traffique and com∣merce,
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
cannot but sometimes have Mer∣chants and Tradesmen in it, who by mis∣adventure of Pyrates or Shipwrack in the Seas, or by conffiscation of their Goods in Forraign Countries abroad, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by casu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lties of Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at home, have their Estates sunk, whereby they are not able for want of Stock and Meane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to continue that course of Merchandiz∣ing and Trade wherein they have been brought up there being great Stocks and sums of money requisite for the con∣tinning of it, whereupon they are forc'd to leave that course, and betake themselves to some other Trade propor∣tionable to that means which they have left. And it were lamentable, that wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inevitable casualties have disabled a man to proceed in that course wherin he was brought up, he now should not be per∣mitted to acquire his living by any o∣ther Trade. Also it may be, that the Trade whereunto he was an Apprentice, requireth great labour and strength of body, as the Trade of a Smith, Carpen∣ter, and such like, and that through sick∣ness or other disasters befaln him, he is become infirm in body, and weak in strength, whereby he is not able to use
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
that Trade. Now to deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him of all other Trades, which are more be fitting his crazy body, were somwhat unreason∣able. Wherefore to meet with these inconveniencies, and to give incourage∣ment unto the Citizens and Freemen of <HI>London</HI> this Custome of relinquishing the Trade whereunto they have been Apprentices by the space of seven years, and betaking themselves unto another Trade, hath had a perpetual allowance, and being grounded upon so good rea∣son still hath its continuance, and may not any wayes be called in question for the unreasonableness of it.</P>
<P>As to the second question <HI>scil.</HI> Whe∣ther the Allegation of it as Custome in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>London</HI> that every Citizen and Freeman of <HI>London</HI> may relinquish his Trade wherein he hath been an Apprentice by the space of seven years, and exercise a∣nother Trade or no, be warrantable by the Rules of Law or no, insomuch that before the Stat. of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> 4. which restraineth it, it was lawful for every man to use what Trade he would, al∣though he had not been an Apprentice by the space of seven years: And then it being the Common Law of the
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
Realm that a man might use any Trade, although he had not been an Ap∣prentice for seven years, it may not be alledged by way of custome in <HI>London,</HI> but it ought to have been shewed, as the custome of the Realm, for that which is the Common Law of the Realm, is the custome of the Realm? It was an∣swered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sel.</NOTE> and agreed, That as this custom was alledged in this information, the al∣legation of it was warrantable in the Law, and it may well be said to be a custome before the Stat. of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> For first.</P>
<P>The custome is restrained to a Citizen <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and Freeman of <HI>London,</HI> so as he that is not a Citizen and Freeman may not enjoy the benefit of this custome, and it being restrictive of the Common Law which giveth power unto all, as well Freemen as Citizens, to exercise what Trade they will, standeth well in cu∣stome, and may well be alledged by way of custome.</P>
<P>This is alledged to be the custome <NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> of <HI>London,</HI> and so is tyed to a particu∣lar place; and howsoever it may be the Common Law of the Realm in other places, yet in <HI>London,</HI> which is for the
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
most part governed by their particular Customes, it may well be said a Custom, and so the Plea in Bar good enough, as to this exception.</P>
<P>As to the fourth Question, <HI>soil.</HI> Whe∣ther the branch of the Statute of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 4.</NOTE> 4. be a repeal and controul of the Cu∣stome of <HI>London</HI> concerning the exer∣cise of a Trade where he hath not been an Apprentice by the space of seven years?</P>
<P>It was resolved that the Custome of <HI>London</HI> was of force, and was not any wayes controuled by that branch.</P>
<P>First, In regard that this being a par∣ticular Custome used in <HI>London,</HI> the ge∣neral <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat,</HI> 1.</NOTE> words of the branch of that Stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall not be taken to extend to the re∣peal of it: For so much regard is to be given unto that City, being <HI>Camera Re∣gis,</HI> and as dear to him as the Apple of his Eye, that the Customes of that place shall not be overthrown by the extent of general words, where there is no particular provision for it, might tend to a great derogation of the City, and likewise might be very prejudicial to the Commonwealth, when as the ill-affect∣edness of this City being the chief mem∣ber
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
of this politique body, cannot but make all the other members to be parta∣kers of theill disposition of it. And up∣on this reason it is, that before such time as the Stat. of <HI>R.</HI> 2. was thought of, it was holden that the Stat. <HI>De Religiosis,</HI> otherwise called the Statute of <HI>Mort∣main,</HI> made in the seventh of the Reign of <HI>E.</HI> 1. which did make a general re∣straint from disposing of lands in <HI>Mort∣main,</HI> did never extend unto the repeal of the custome of <HI>London,</HI> which did en∣able those that were Citizens and Freemen of <HI>London</HI> to devise their lands in <HI>Mortmain,</HI> as before.</P>
<P>Secondly, The City of <HI>London,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 2.</NOTE> the custome therein used, being the ex∣ample and patern which the Statute of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> in some parts of it doth require should be followed, as in that branch, wherein provision is made, that every person being an housholder, and twenty four years old at the least, dwelling or inhabiting, or which shall dwell or inhabit in a City or Town Corporate, and use or exercise any art, mystery, or manual occupation, shall and may yet have and retain the Son of any Freeman not occupying Husbandry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to serve.
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
and be bound as an Apprentice, after the custome and order of the City of <HI>London</HI> for seven years at the least. It seemeth that the intent of the makers of that Statute, was rather to confirm; than repeal the customes of <HI>London,</HI> for it would never make the custome of <HI>London</HI> to be the example which ought to be persued, if it had had an intenti∣on to repeal it. And by the same reason, that the custome of <HI>London</HI> shall not be comprehended within the general words of one branch of the Statute, the general words of another branch shall not be extended unto them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it is to be observed, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 3.</NOTE> Statute of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> hath a <HI>proviso,</HI> That this Act, nor any thing therein contain∣ed or mentioned shall not be prejudicial or hurtful unto the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Norwich</HI> or to the lawful Liberties, usa∣ges, customes, or priviledges of the same Cities. And howsoever it speaketh, on∣ly concerning the having or taking of Apprentices, yet by the whole scope of the Statute, which maketh the customes of <HI>London</HI> to be their directions in many things enacted by that Statute, it appear∣eth, that the intent was to preserve the
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
Customes of <HI>London,</HI> and not any ways to abolish them. For it should be very mischievous to the City, and would en∣danger the subversion and decay of it; if all Acts of Parliament by their gene∣ral words should stretch to repeal the cu∣stoms of <HI>London,</HI> in Case where they are somewhat opposite unto the Statute.</P>
<P>Fourthly, upon the matter, there must be a repeal of the Statute of <HI>Magna Char∣ta,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 4. 9. <HI>H.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 9.</NOTE> <HI>cap.</HI> 9. which confirmes all the Cu∣stomes of <HI>London,</HI> the which shall not be done by general words in a Statute, be∣cause it hath been so often-times con∣firmed.</P>
<P>As to the Fifth Question, <HI>scil.</HI> Whe∣ther the Trade of an <HI>Upholster</HI> be a Trade <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 5.</NOTE> restrained within the Statute of 5. <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 4. So that none can exercise it, but he that hath been an Apprentice by the space of seven years?</P>
<P>It was agreed and resolved, That an <HI>Upholster</HI> is not a Trade within that Stat. For first it is not a trade that is mention∣ed in any of the branches of the Statute, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 1.</NOTE> howsoever in all parts of the Statute there is mention made of sixty one seve∣ral trades and mysteries. And if the Arti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans which at that time were Assistants
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
unto the Commitees for the expressing of all manner of Trades, and thought that the Trade of an <HI>Vpholster</HI> had been such a Trade that required Art and Skill for the exercising of it, they would not have failed to make mention of it. Se∣condly, there having been two former <NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> Acts of Parliament, that is to say, the Sta∣tute of 7. <HI>H.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 17. and 5. <HI>Ed.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 23. made concerning <HI>Vpholsters,</HI> it was not necessary that mention should be made of it in this Statute, and so it shall be intended that there was purposely an omission made of an <HI>Vpholster,</HI> because there was sufficient Provision made for him formerly. Thirdly, the Trade of an <HI>Vpholster</HI> doth not require any Art or <NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> Skill for the exercising of it, inasmuch as he hath all things made to his hand, and it is only to dispose them in order after such time as they are brought to him, as the Ticks of his Beds he borroweth from a Weaver, the Frames of his Beds and Stooles from the Joyners and Tur∣ners, his Iron-Rods and Nailes from the Smith, his guilding, and setting forth and adorning of his Beds and Stools from the Guilder and Painter; and so he is like to <HI>Aesops</HI> Bird, which borroweth
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
of every Bird a feather, his art resting meerly in the overseeing and disposition of such things which other men work, and in the putting of feathers into a tick, and sowing them up when he hath done, the which one that hath been an Appren∣tice unto it but seven days is able to per∣form. And the intent of this Statute was not to extend unto any other trades, but such as required Art and Skill for the managing of them: and therefore it was adjudged in the Exchequer upon an in∣formation against one in the 42, year of the Reign of the late Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> that a Coster-monger was not a Trade intended by the Statute of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> because his art was in the selling of Apples, the which required no skill or experience for the exercise of it. So an Husbandman, Tankard-bearer, Brick∣maker, Porter, Miller, and such like Trades, are not within the Statute of 5. <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 4. so as none may exercise them, but such a one that hath been an Apprentice by the space of seven years; for they are arts which require rather a∣billity of body than skill: But a Brewer and Baker are within the Statute, be∣cause it concerneth the health of mens
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
bodies to have good Bread baked, and Beer b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewed, and so it is fit that they should have skil for the exercise of them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, an <HI>Upholster</HI> being no such <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 4.</NOTE> Trade within the Stat. of 5. <HI>Eliz.</HI> as may compel one to be an Apprentice unto him for the space of seven years; for it is not mentioned within that branch that concerneth the compelling of men to be Apprentices. It is not any such trade as is within that branch, which com∣pelleth men to be Apprentices for the space of seven years, before such time as they can exercise it; for none shall be within the branch that restraineth men to exercise their trades, where they have not bin Apprentices by the space of seven years; but such as are within that other branch, to compel men to be Apprenti∣ces unto them by the space of 7. years. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>As to the sixth Question, which is; whether the Court of the Mayor of <HI>London</HI> be such a Court of Record, as an information may be exhibited in it upon this Statute of the 5. of <HI>Eliz. cap</HI> 4?</P>
<P>It was answered and resolved, that it <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sol.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</NOTE> was. For it is expressed by precise terms, in one of the last branches of the said Statute, That the said Mayor, or o∣ther
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>
Head-Officers of the Cities or Towns Corporate, shall have full pow∣er and authority to hear and determine all and every offence and offences, that shall be committed or done against this Statute, or against any branch thereof, as well upon Indictment to be taken be∣fore them in the Sessions of the Peace, as upon Informatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Action of Debt, or Bill or Complaint to be sued or exhi∣bited by any person, and shall and may by vertue thereof make process against the Defendant, and award Execution, as in any other case they lawfully may by any the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, and the Presidents have been alwayes accordingly. For in the 44. year of the late Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> an Information was exhibited by one <HI>Robinson</HI> against <HI>Toby,</HI> in the Mayors Court of <HI>London,</HI> because he exercised the Trade of a <HI>Cut∣ler▪</HI> where he had not been an Apprentice by the space of seven years, and allow∣ed to be well exhibited. So in the Case \l=o▪\f one <HI>Banister,</HI> and Information exhi∣bited in that Court, because he had ex∣ercised the Trade of a <HI>Weaver,</HI> where he had not been Apprentice by the space of seven years, was admitted good.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="17"/>
As to the seventh Question, which is, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 7.</NOTE> Whether the Informer may demand the Moyety of the forfeitures upon this Sta∣tute, because in a branch in the latter end of the Statute, it is enacted, <HI>That all manner of Amerciaments, Fines, Issues, and Forfeitures, which shall arise, grow, or come by reason of any offences, or defaults mentioned in this Act or any branch there∣of, within any City or Town Corporate, shall be levied, gathered, and received by any person or persons of the same City, or Town Corporate, as shall be appointed by the Mayor, or other Head Officers mentioned in this Act, to the use and maintenance of the same City or Town,</HI> in such case and condition as any other Amerciaments, Fines, Issues, or Forfeitures, have been used to belevied, or imployed within the same City or Town Corporate, by rea∣son of any Grant or Charter from the Queens Majesty that now is, or any her Graces Noble Progenitours, made or granted to the same City, Burrough, or Town Corporate, any thing, or clause before mentioned or expressed to the contrary notwithstanding?</P>
<P>It was answered and resolved, That the Informer might well demand a Moyety; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sol.</NOTE>
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
for there being a former branch, that enacted, that the one half of all forfei∣tures and penalties expested and menti∣oned in this Act other than such as are expresly otherways appointed, shall be to our Soveraign Lady the Queens Ma∣jesty, her Heirs, and Successors, and the other moyety to him or them that shall sue for the same in any of the Queens Majesties Courts of Record or before a∣ny of the Jus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> or before any other Justices or Presi∣dents and Councel before remembred, by action of Debt, Information, Bill of Complaint or otherwise: The Inform∣er may demand his Moyety, by ver∣tue of this branch; and the subsequent branch which gives the Forfeitures unto the Mayor, shall be taken only of the forfeitures which are given to the Queen, and not of that which is given to the Informer, who is the means whereby the other Moyety is brought to the Mayor, and other Officers.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Custome of</HI> London <HI>Touching Forreign Attachment.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>IOhn Tenant</HI> a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> is indebted fourty pound by specialty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mich. 12 <HI>Jac.</HI> Rs.

<P><HI>Spink</HI> forbeareth <HI>Tenant</HI> accordingly, but the fourty pounds is not paid accord∣ing to promise.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="questions">
<HEAD>The Questions in this Case are,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Whether this Debt of the Intestate being only a Debt due upon a simple Contract, be such a Debt of which a Forreign Attachment may be made according to the custome of <HI>London?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Whether the custome of forreign At∣tachments may hold in this Case, In∣asmuch as by the Statute made in <HI>An</HI> 31. <HI>Ed. cap.</HI> the name of <HI>Admini∣strators</HI> was created, and before that Statute <HI>Lettars of Administration</HI> were never granted?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether there being a Forreign At∣tachment of the Debt due unto the <HI>Intestate,</HI> after the not performing of the promise, and Title of action gi∣ven unto <HI>Spink</HI> the Plaintiff, be a dis∣pensation with the promise, so as now
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>
the action faileth upon the promise for not paying the money.</P>
<P>As to the first Question, which is, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 1.</NOTE> Whether for the debt, being a debt due only upon a simple contract, a forreign Attachment may be used or no?</P>
<P>It was agreed and resolved, that a forreign Attachment might well be su∣ed for it: For by the custome of <HI>London,</HI> the Executor or Administrator being chargeable for a debt due by the Testa∣tor, or Intestate upon a simple contract, as well as upon a specialty, a Forreign Attachment may be sued as well for that debt, as for a debt due upon Specialty. And howsoever the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> or any other Court of <HI>Westminster,</HI> be not bound to take notice of this particular custome of <HI>London</HI> in charging the Ex∣ecutors, or Administrators upon the simple Contract, nor to give judgement according to the custome yet when judgment hath been given according to that custome, and that judgement appeareth judicially unto the Judges by the Record: Now they ought to al∣low the custome, and give their judge∣ment
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
according to that custome in af∣firmance of the judgment given in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> But it was agreed, that if there had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mich.</HI> 39 40. <HI>Eliz Para∣moreversus Pain.</HI></NOTE> not been any debt due by the Intestate unto <HI>Haydon;</HI> Now howsoever there had been an Attachment made in <HI>London</HI> of the debt due by <HI>Spink</HI> unto the Intestate, and a judgement given upon it, yet might the Administrator have relieved himself by way of Denial, and Traverse that there had been any debt due by the Intestate unto <HI>Haydon.</HI></P>
<P>As to the second Question, which is, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 2.</NOTE> Whether the custome of Forreign At∣tachments in <HI>London</HI> may hold as this Case is?</P>
<P>It was agreed and resolved, That it may and doth well enough hold. For howsoever that none was charge able at the Common Law by the name of an Administrator, inasmuch as by the Sta∣tute of 31. <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> No accusation lay against an Administrator by that name; And that <HI>A custome may not commence since the making of that Statute;</HI> yet in∣asmuch as he was chargable at the Com∣mon Law as an Executor for his Admini∣stration
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
so that the name of the charge is only changed, and yet in substance is all one (For every Executor is an Ad∣ministrator and the pleading is upon an action brought against an Executor, that he never was Executor, nor ever admi∣nistred as an Executor. And an Ad∣ministrator hath the quality and office of an Executor.) Therefore the custom of Forreign Attachments will hold a∣gainst an Administrator, as well as against an Executor.</P>
<P>As to the third Question which is, Whether the Forreign Attachment for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest.</NOTE> the debt due unto the Intestate after the promise broken be such a dispensation with the promise, that no Action now lieth for the Administrator upon the breach of the promise?</P>
<P>It was agreed and resolved, that the promise was dispensed with, and no action lay upon the breach of it; for the debt due by <HI>Tenant</HI> unto the Intestate; which was the ground, and cause of the promise made unto <HI>Spink:</HI> the Plaintiff is taken away by the judgement had in <HI>London</HI> upon the custome of Forreign
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
Attachments, <HI>Et sublato fundamento fal∣lit opus.</HI> And therefore if after the pro∣mise broken there had been a Recovery had of the principal debt by the Plaintiff as Administrator, or otherwise, there had been a Release made unto the Defen∣dant. Now the Action upon the Case upon the promise would have failed, in∣asmuch as the debt, which was the con∣sideration, and ground of the promise is gone, and so the dampnification which he should have had by not performance of the promise faileth.</P>
<P>And agreeing to this resolution was the Case of one <HI>Bardeston,</HI> and <HI>Humfry</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mich.</HI> 37 38. <HI>Eliz.

<PB REF="23"/>
<HI>George Hanger,</HI> to be recovered as his <NOTE PLACE="marg">22. <HI>H.</HI> 6. 4.</NOTE> Wines, to be taken in execution as his Wines, and to prevent a Forfeiture, be∣cause these Wines shall be said to be the Wines of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> whereby they may be protected, and priviledged from the payment of Prisage within the words, intent, meaning of the before re∣cited Charter made by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, which pointeth rather at the Wines then at the person of <HI>George Hanger.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, in regard that <HI>Frances Han∣ger</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 2.</NOTE> being the Executrix of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> is the representative person of <HI>George Hanger</HI> as to these Wines, so that such Priviledges and Immunities as <HI>George Hanger</HI> was to enjoy if he had been li∣ving, the same shall <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> have benefit of after his death. And there∣fore <NOTE PLACE="marg">21 <HI>H.</HI> 6. 30</NOTE> notwithstanding <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> had been a Nun, and so a dead person in Law to all intents and purposes, yet she being made an Executrix and so the re∣presentative person of the said <HI>George Hanger,</HI> shall be enabled to sue, and be sued, as concerning the personal Estate of the Testator, so far as <HI>George Hanger</HI> him∣self might sue, or be sued. And if <HI>Fran∣ces
<PB REF="24"/>
Hanger,</HI> being a Neif had been made <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1 <HI>E.</HI> 4. 50.</NOTE> Executrix now she being the representa∣tive person of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> may well enough sue her Lord unto whom she is a Neif Reguardant, or any other person whatsoever, and the being of a Neif shall not be any disability unto her, as to her office of Executrix-ship. The same Law would have been if <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> had been wained and afterwards had been made Executrix; for she putting on the person of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> and represent∣ing him, shall be clothed with the same Priviledges and Abilities as he was, and so <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> being enabled by the common Laws of this Realm, to sue, and to be sued, although she had been a Nun, a Neif, or a wained person, because she represented the person of <HI>George Hanger</HI> whose Executrix she was, shall be likewise capable of this priviledge of the payment of Prisage for the Wines of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> as <HI>George Hanger</HI> was.</P>
<P>Thirdly this Charter made by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, being a Charter only <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat,</HI> 3.</NOTE> to discharge the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> of the payment of Prisage, and not a Charter whereby the Prisage of the Citizens of
<PB REF="24"/>
<HI>London</HI> is granted unto others, shall have a liberal construction, and not be strein∣ed unto a special intent as a Patent of charge shall be; for it is evident by di∣vers cases in our Books, that <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> being an Executrix, shall be ta∣ken to be within the remedy of an Act of Parliament, to discharge her self of a burden imposed upon her in respect of <HI>George Hanger</HI> her Testator, notwith∣standing there was never so much as any mention made of her as Executrix, in the Act of Parliament. And therefore <HI>Fran∣ces Hanger</HI> being an Executrix, shall have an attaint upon the Statute of 23. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>chap.</HI> 3. <NOTE PLACE="marg">3 <HI>Eliz</HI> Dy 100.</NOTE> to discharge her self of a false Verdict given against <HI>George Hanger,</HI> whereby his Goods are to be charged, and yet she is not named in the Act of Parliament. So <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> being an Executrix, shall have a Writ of Errour upon the Statute of 27. <HI>El. chap.</HI> 8. in the Exchequer Chamber, to discharge her <NOTE PLACE="marg">26. <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Lord <HI>Mordants</HI> Case.</NOTE> self of an Erroneous Judgement given into the Kings Bench against <HI>George Han∣ger,</HI> whereby his Goods are subject to an Execution. Likewise if <HI>George Han∣ger</HI> be Out-lawed upon a Writ of <HI>Cap. ad satisfaciend,</HI> awarded upon a Judge∣ment
<PB REF="25"/>
given in Debt, or other personal Action against him, <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> as Executrix of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> shall take advantage of a general pardon made by Act of Parliament in the life of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> and shall be suffered to plead it, <HI>and to give satisfaction of the judgement</HI> given against <HI>George Hanger,</HI> whereby she may be enabled to take benefit of the pardon; the which being so, that <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> is a person capable to discharge her self of a false Verdict of an Erroneous Judgement, of an Out-lawry pronounced against <HI>George Hanger</HI> her husband where the Statute by precise words doth not relieve her, <HI>à fortiori</HI> shall <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> in the case at the Bar, be enabled to discharge her self of the prisage of these Wines, within the Char∣ter of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.</P>
<P>Fourthly, by the same reason, that the Butlarage shall be paid by the Executors <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat</HI> 4.</NOTE> or Administrators of an Alien, for the Wines brought into <HI>England,</HI> in case where the Alien owner of the Wines do die before such time as the Ships are un∣laden, and way shall not be given to make an evasion to the payment of Butlarge, upon an averment that the owner of the
<PB REF="25"/>
Wines is dead before the unbulcking of the Ships, so by the same reason prisage shall not be paid for the Wines of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> who dyed before such time as the Ships came in; for those Wines shall continue the Wines of the Alien, to make his Executors subject unto the pay∣ment of Butlarage: so these Wines shall remain the Wines of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> to free <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> his Executrix from the payment of prisage.</P>
<P>Fifthly, there being nothing done in the case at the Bar, to prevent <HI>George</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <HI>Hanger</HI> whereby his Wines should be made uncapable of the discharge of the payment of Prisage within the Charter granted by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third but only the death of <HI>George Hanger</HI> before the disburdening, and unlading of his Ships; and this being only the Act of God, which by no power of man can be resisted, nor wit prevented, shall never turn him to that prejudice that a charge now shall be imposed upon his Wines, the which ought not to have been, if <HI>George Hanger</HI> had over-lived the time of breaking the bulk; for it is a Maxim, held, and a principle of the common Lawes of the Realm, that the Act of
<PB REF="26"/>
God shall never prejudice in case where there is not any Latches in the party; and upon this reason is it that if one that is impleaded hath cause of privi∣ledge, because he is the menial Ser∣vant of the Lord Chancellour, he shall not be prevented of priviledge by the death of the Lord Chancellour, but he <NOTE PLACE="marg">35. <HI>H.</HI> 6. 3.</NOTE> shall enjoy it, that death notwith∣standing; likewise it would be a great discouragement to the Merchants, to hazard their own lives in fighting a∣gainst the Pyrates, and in being upon the Seas when their deaths shall sub∣ject them to the payment of Pri∣sage.</P>
<P>Sixthly, in the case at the Bar, there <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 6.</NOTE> are four times to be observed; the first of which is the time of the fraughting of the Ships, and the sending them out of <HI>England</HI> beyond the Seas; the second is the time of the arrival of the Ships, and the unlading, and disburdening of them beyond the Seas, the third is the time of the lading of the Ships with Wines, and the returning of them for <HI>England;</HI> the fourth is the time of the arrival at the Port in <HI>England,</HI> and the unlading of them here; and three of these times were passed
<PB REF="26"/>
in the life of <HI>George Hadger</HI> when he was a member of the City, and a Citizen as others are, for all the four Ships, and part of the fourth time also for two of the Ships; for at the time that the Ships were Fraughted and sent out of <HI>England</HI> to the intent to bring in these commodi∣ties, <HI>George Hanger</HI> was a Citizen; so when the Ships arrived in the Port beyond the Seas, and unladed themselves to receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Wines for which they went, he continued a Citizen. Likewise when the Ships were laden with Wines, and returning to the coasts of <HI>England,</HI> the hand of Heaven had not as yet disfran∣chised him from being a Citizen, and member of the City of <HI>London.</HI> And as to two of the Ships, the said <HI>George Han∣ger</HI> had his abode here until such time as they were in the Port at <HI>London</HI> safe from being swallowed by the surging waves of the Sea, secure from the sur∣prizing of the desparate Pyrates; the which being so that three of the four times as to all the four Ships were past during the time that he was a member of the City, and also part of the fourth time as to two of the Ships, it is reasona∣ble to think that these Ships shall partici∣pate
<PB REF="27"/>
of Immunity and Priviledge, it be discharged of the payment of prisage which is granted by the Charter made b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King <HI>Edward</HI> the third notwithstand¦ing that the last time was not com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before his death; and the more espe∣cially also, because the law hath such re¦gard unto the commencement, and be∣ginning of a thing, and will have respect unto it, notwithstanding that there be∣long distance of time between the in choation, and consummation of it. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore where a servant having an in¦tention to kill his Master, doth depart ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his service and long time after his de¦parture out of his Masters service doth kill him, that is petty treason in the ser∣vant, <NOTE PLACE="marg">33. <HI>Ass.</HI> Parl. 7.</NOTE> in regard of the retrospect which the Law hath to the first intention of the servant, when he was in his Masters service; and yet if you respect the time of the murder committed, without re∣gard had unto the first time, it cannot be petty treason, because the servant was out of his service at that time.</P>
<P>Seventhly, it is to be observed, that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 7.</NOTE> this Charter to be discharged of the pay∣ment of prisage granted by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was granted unto the Mayor
<PB REF="27"/>
and Commonalty of <HI>London,</HI> which is a body that alwayes continueth, and never dieth; and so howsoever that <HI>George Hanger,</HI> unto whom (as unto a member of that body) the priviledge of that Char∣ter is distributed, be dead, and cut off from that body, yet in so much that the body politique of the Mayor and Commonalty unto whom the Charter was made liveth, the Priviledge and Immunity of <HI>George Hanger</HI> to have his Wines discharged of the payment of prisage will live, and continue in that body notwithstanding that <HI>George Hanger</HI> be dead.</P>
<P>Eightly this Charter being a Charter made for the advancement and good of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 8.</NOTE> Merchandize and trading (which are as it were the Blood which giveth nourish∣ment unto the politique body of the Kingdome) is to have a favourable and benigne construction, whereby trading may be the better supported and main∣tained; and the life of the State longer continued; and therefore where King <HI>Edward</HI> the third in the third year of his Reign, granted unto the Merchants of <HI>Almagne, France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> that they should come safely, and securely with their Merchandize into <HI>England,</HI> and
<PB REF="28"/>
should be free from Pontage, Murag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and such other Tolles, this Grant was al∣lowed to be good, and received an ex¦position according unto the Law o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Merchants, which is the Law of Nati∣ons; and howsoever it would not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good by the strict rules of the Common Law, because the Merchant-strange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were not a Corporation able to take yet it was admitted sufficient by that <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gem marcatoriam,</HI> according to whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in some cases of Merchants the Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Common Law ought to give the Judgement, wherefore in the case at the Bar, this Charter concerning the City of <HI>London,</HI> which is the University of Mer∣chants, and this case concerning <HI>George Hanger</HI> which was a Scholar trained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this in School, and had been matricula∣ted in this place, the Judge are to fram and give their Judgement so, as the Un∣versity and Scholars of it, may receive the better encouragement to proceed and may not be disheartened to dive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their courses intended, from Merchandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing and Trading, by reason of the stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> construction of Charters which giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto them Immunities, and Priv¦ledges.</P>
<P><PB REF="28"/>
Ninthly and lastly, this very case re∣ceived <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 9.</NOTE> formerly the resolution of three Barons in the Exchequer, upon an Infor∣mation exhibited there by Sir <HI>Thomas Waller,</HI> that <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> should be discharged of Prisage for the Wines in all the four Ships; whereupon Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> discontinued his Information, and exhi∣bited it <HI>denove</HI> in the Kings Bench, whereby he would take the opinion of this Court likewise; and there having been former opinion conceived for the discharge of them, it is more agreeable with reason to have this opinion confirm∣ed than opposed.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Thomas Fleming;</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Crook,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Haughton</HI> seemed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Judges of Contrary opinion.</NOTE> upon the reasons hereafter ensuing, that Judgement ought to be given for Sir <HI>Thomas Waller,</HI> and that prisage ought to be paid by <HI>Frances Hanger,</HI> both for the Wines wich were in the Ships that were arrived before the death of <HI>George Hanger,</HI> as likewise for the Wines which were in the two Ships which were upon the Sea at the time of the death of <HI>George Hanger;</HI> howsoever by way of advice they wished that for the Wines in the Ships which were come home du∣ring
<PB REF="29"/>
his life, the payment of prisage ought not to be pressed by Sir <HI>Thomas Waller.</HI></P>
<P>First, in regard the Charter extendeth <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> 1.</NOTE> only to discharge the Wines of such a person as is a Citizen of <HI>London</HI> of the payment of prisage, and <HI>George Hanger</HI> being dead, and so a Citizen of the hea∣vedly <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> may not be longer said to be a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> and so not within the compass of the Immunity granred by the Charter.</P>
<P>Secondly this priviledge to be dis∣charged <NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> of the payment of prisage, is in respect of the person who is the own∣er of the Wines, and not in respect of the Wines themselves and then there be∣ing a remotion of the person unto whom the exemption is tyed, there is a remo∣tion of the exemption it self; and there∣fore notwithstanding a Tenant in ancient Demesne, be by the Common Lawes of this Realm to be discharged of the pay∣ment of Toll in all Faires, and Markets, yet if the Tenant in ancient Demesne make his Executors, and die the Execu∣tors for the Goods of the Testator are to pay a Toll, in so much, that it was only a personal priviledge which dieth together with the person.</P>
<P><PB REF="29"/>
Thirdly, this Charter bereaving the King of the payment of prisage which is a Flower of his Crown, ought to have a strict construction, so as none may take benefit of it, but only such as are within the precise words of the Charter; wherefore <HI>George Hanger</HI> being dead, and so no more a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> howsoever the Wines in the Ship may be said to be the Wines of <HI>George Hanger</HI> to a special intent, that is to say, for the payment of his Debts, and the perform∣ance of his Legacies according to his true intendment expressed in his Will, yet may they not be said to be the Goods of <HI>George Hanger</HI> to every intent, in so much that <HI>Frances Hanger</HI> the Executrix hath the disposition of them according to her will, and pleasure, and the Poet saith, <HI>Da tua dum tua sunt, nam post mortem tua non sunt;</HI> and they not being the Wines of a Citizen to every intent, but only to a special intent, may not be said to be capable of the discharge of pay∣ment of prisage according to the Case that hath been adjudged, that where the King by his Letters Patents doth grant <NOTE PLACE="marg">8. <HI>H.</HI> 42.</NOTE> the Goods, and Chattels of all Felons and Fugitives unto a common person, now
<PB REF="30"/>
the Patentee, by vertue of this grant, may not claim the Goods, and Chattels of one that is a Felon of himself, in so much that he is a Felon only to a special in∣tent; and this being a Flower of the Kings Crown, shall not pass by general words,</P>
<P>Fourthly, Prisage being a thing <NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> which is not due until such time as the bulk be broken; now forasmuch as <HI>George Hanger</HI> was dead, and so was dis∣franchised before such time as the duty accrued, the Charter shall not extend to discharge the Wines in the hands of the Executrix of the payment of Prisage.</P>
<P>And so having given you a taste of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>H. Calthrops</HI> report and opinion.</NOTE> opinion of the Judges upon the main case: I will descend to the other mat∣ters considerable in this case, upon this Charter; and for better order and me∣thods sake, I will divide it into the parts hereafter following, that is to say.</P>
<P>First, what Prisage is, and to whom due, the nature of it, and the diversity between Butlerage, and Prisage.</P>
<P>Secondly, what is the cause, and ground why the King hath Prisage.</P>
<P>Thirdly at what time prisage shall be said to be due.</P>
<P><PB REF="30"/>
Fourthly, whether a grant, or discharge may be made by the King of Prisage.</P>
<P>Fifthly, whether the Charter of dis∣charge unto the Mayor and Commonal∣ty of the payment of Prisage be good, when the grant is made to the Mayor and Commonalty, and the benefit di∣stributed unto the natural persons and the ground of the making of this Charter.</P>
<P>Sixthly, what persons shall be discharg∣ed of the payment of Prisage within the words of the Charter which saith, <HI>Quod de vinis Civium nulla prisa fiat.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly, what Wines shall be said to be discharged of the payment of Pri∣sage within the words of the Charter.</P>
<P>As to the first, Prisage is a certain duty which the King and his Predecessours by <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. What pri∣sage is.</NOTE> themselves, or their Officers by a custom (time out of mind of man) hath used to take for the provision of his houshold of all <HI>English</HI> Merchants of all Wines whatsoever, which the said <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chants bring from beyond the Seas into the Coasts of <HI>England.</HI> In which said description it is first observed, that it is a duty due from the subject unto his Maje∣sty, and not a voluntary gift of the subject unto the King. Hereupon it is that in
<PB REF="31"/>
<HI>H.</HI> 4. 3. in the Patent-Roll in the Tower you shall find prisage termed by the name of <HI>Regia, &amp; Recta prisa;</HI> for that it apper∣reineth and is due unto the King of com∣mon Right; and being a Flower of his Crown, may not belong unto any man else but by especial Grant. Secondly, it appeareth that it is called a certain duty, because it is manifestly certain, what the King shall have out of every Ship, both in respect of the time when he shall take it, in respect of the place where he shall have it, and in respect of the quantity which he shall have. For as to the time when he shall take it, it is upon the breaking of the Bulk of the Ship, and not before; for if a Ship come into the Port laden with Wines, and the Bulk of her is not broken, now may not <NOTE PLACE="marg">6. <HI>E.</HI> 3. 5.</NOTE> Prisage be demanded of her. And as to the place where the King shall take this prisage, it is ascertained by a Book-Case, where it is said, That the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">20. <HI>Ric.</HI> 2. Rot. Pat.</NOTE> shall take one Tun behind the Mast, and the other before. And as to the certain quantity which the King is to take, it is manifest by divers ancient Records; for if a Ship have ten Tun in her, and under the number of twenty
<PB REF="31"/>
Tuns, then the King is to have one Tun only; but if the Ship containeth twenty Tuns and more, then the King is to have two Tuns, the one to be taken behind the Mad, and the other before the Mast, the King paying for the portage twen∣ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, and by reason of these certainties you shall find in the Patent-Rolls in the Tower 28. <HI>E.</HI> 1. that it is called, <NOTE PLACE="marg">28. <HI>E,</HI> 1. Rot. Pat.</NOTE> <HI>Certa prisa.</HI> Thirdly, it is to be observed that is not a duty newly encroached, for it hath by custom (time out of mind of man) been taken; for the ancientest Records now remaining with us do make mention of the payment of it; for in the Pat. Rol. aforementioned being in the 40<SUP>th</SUP> year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third it is spoken of; and <HI>Fleta</HI> who wrote in the begin∣ning <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fleta. Lib.</HI> 2. cap. 22.</NOTE> of <HI>E.</HI> 1. his time, hath not been si∣lent in declaring the nature of prisage; and in the 15. <HI>E.</HI> 2. <HI>Rast all</HI> Estreats Sect. 22. an ordinance is made amongst other things that the Butler of the King for the time being, either by himself or his De∣puty shall enroll the Wines of prisage, how many times he hath taken them, the testimony of persons of whom the price was had, where, and when, and the Customers of <HI>England</HI> shall be charged
<PB REF="32"/>
according as they are assigned for the gathering of customes within I certain bounds, that they twice yearly shall certifie the Treasurer and Barons how many Ships have arrived within their bounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And how many Ships arri∣ved of whom the King did take prisage of Wine, and how many Tunnes, and in what Ships the King did take twosh. for the Tun. And for the other price. And in the Pat. Rol. extant in 20. <HI>R.</HI> 2. you <NOTE PLACE="marg">20. <HI>R.</HI> 2. Rot. Pat.</NOTE> may see the Record speak in this manner. <HI>Memorandum quod Rex habet ex antiqua consuetudine de qualibet navi mercatoria applicante infra aliquem portum Regni Angliae duo dolia vini,</HI> &amp;c. All which shew the antiquity of it. Fourthly, it is said of all <HI>English</HI> Merchants to make a difference between those that are Mer∣chants, and those that buy Wines be∣yond the Seas for their own private pro∣vision. Secondly to make a distinction between the <HI>English</HI> Merchants and the Merchant-strangers, for Merchant-strangers by a Charter made unto them (called by the name of <HI>Charta Merca∣toria)</HI> in the one and thirtieth year of <HI>E.</HI> 1, his Reign are discharged of the payment of prisage, in recompence, and lien of
<PB REF="32"/>
which Immunity granted unto them, the Merchant-strangers by way of thankful restitution granted unto the King and his Successours, that he should have two sh. of every Tun of Wine brought in by them within fourty dayes after it is brought into the Port, the which two sh. is called by the name of Butlerage, because the Kings Chief Butler by reason of his Office is to re∣ceive it. And those subject of the Kings who do buy Wines beyond the Seas for their own spending, without a∣ny intention to Merchandize, ought not to pay prisage for those Wines. Sixthly, it is expressed of all Wines brought from beyond the Seas; for that if Wines should be made in <HI>England.</HI> as in times past they have been (as it appeareth by an ancient Record in <HI>Windsor-Castle,</HI> where it is said that the Parson had ten pound for the Tythe of Claret-Wine mad there) and they should be trans∣ported from one Port to another to be sold, no prisage shall be paid for them. Lastly, it is described which hath used to be taken, and not which hath used to be paid by the owners, and Merchants of the Wines, and the <HI>Etymology</HI> of the
<PB REF="33"/>
word importeth as much. For <HI>Prisae</HI> being the Latine word for prisage, hath it's name of <HI>prendere,</HI> and is no more than <HI>Prizel,</HI> which is taking, and is a Participle of the word <HI>Prendere,</HI> which may be applied to all manner of takings; howsoever here it is only limited to the taking of Wines.</P>
<P>As to the second part, which is what <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. The ground of paying the K. pri∣sage.</NOTE> is the cause, and ground of the payment of prisage, there is not any Record to be seen which manifesteth the original cause of the payment of it; but it is pro∣bably conjectured that for as much as the King of <HI>England</HI> is King of the nar∣row Seas, and hath been alwayes at a perpetual charge in the maintaining of Ships for the defence of his Merchants, and protecting of them from the cruel spoile of the Pyrates, and in scouring the Seas to make their passage the more se∣cure; therefore in recompence and sa∣tisfaction of this care, and charge, the Merchants have always used (time out of mind) to give an allowance unto the King, and his Officers for the taking of this prisage of Wines for the better pro∣vision of his houshold, the which al∣lowance, and usage being continued
<PB REF="33"/>
time out of mind, hath made it to be a duty unto the King, and likewise be∣cause the King hath used to take one Tun out of ten Tuns, and two Tuns out of twenty Tuns (for in ancient time, the Ships that went for these Wines being no great Voyage, were not of much greater burden) some have conceived that this was in nature of a Tythe, paid unto the King, and as the particular Pa∣stor, which ministreth spiritual things for the Food of the Soul, hath of right the tenth part of his clear gains due unto him: So the King in that proportion be∣ing <HI>Parens patriae,</HI> and the general Pa∣stor of all his Subjects, protecting their lives and goods from violent oppression upon the Seas hath received, and taken the tenth part of the Wines brought in. But this only conjectured, and there∣fore I cannot warrant it to be a sure Foundation to build on.</P>
<P>As to the third, which is, at what time prisage is said to be due. I do like∣wise <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. When pri∣sage is due.</NOTE> find some doubt to be made of it; for some Judges (unto whose Learning, and Judgement because of their Emi∣nent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Ed. Crook,</HI> Sir <HI>John Dod∣dridge.</HI></NOTE> parts, and singular industry, much reverence is to be ascribed) have been

of opinion that before such time as the bulk of the Ship be broken up, or that it be arrived at the <HI>English</HI> Port, prisage is due, and therefore if a Ship after such time as it is come up into the Haven, finding that Wines will not bear any price, doth before the Bulk of the Ship be broken, depart out of the Harbour, and go back beyond the Seas, and there vent those Wines. The King, this not∣withstanding, may require his prisage at the Merchants hands; for the narrow Seas being within the Alleageance of the King of <HI>England,</HI> as it appeareth by di∣vers of our year-Books, so soon as the <NOTE PLACE="marg">6. <HI>R.</HI> 2. 46.</NOTE> Ships come upon them, there is the duty of prisage accrued unto the King, where∣of it doth not lie in the power of the Merchant to defeat him; and also the very nature of prisage being to have one Tun before the Mast, and one other Tun behind the Mast, sheweth that the King hath an Election to take his Tuns of Wine where he will, the which may not be, if the duty of prisage should arise out of the breaking of the Bulk for when the Bulk is broken, how doth it appear which is the Tun before the Mast, and which is the Tun behind the
<PB REF="34"/>
Mast? So as the King may have the E∣lection to take his prisage, as the Law giveth it unto him; and they are of o∣pinion, that if a Ship come into the Port laden with Wines, that the King is not to expect his prisage where the Mer∣chant will unlade his Wines; for it be∣ing a certain duty accrued unto the King upon the coming into the Port, he may take it at the Port, and is not bound to wait upon the Merchant from one Port unto another, untill he will or can un∣lade his Ship: But the residue of the Justices which argued in this case, were of opinion, that prisage is not due, un∣til the Bulk of the Ship be broken; so as that if the Merchant after his arrival at the Port, will go unto another Port, the King may not take his prisage before such time as they come unto that Port where they unlade; and their opinion was grounded upon the reasons follow∣ing, that is to say; First, because the reason and ground of the payment of prisage, being the security which the Merchants enjoy by, and through the care and charge of the King upon the narrow Seas, they ought to be secured of that benefit, before such time as
<PB REF="35"/>
they shall be forced to pay the duty; and before the breaking of the Bulk of the Ship, they are not ascertained of their safe conduct, insomuch that how∣soever they be in the Port or Harbour, yet they may have cause to put out into the Main again, as if they were driven in there through danger of Pyrates, or violence of Tempests, their Cocquet shewing their course to be bent unto an∣other place, and it is no reason that the K. should take his duty before such time as the Merchant be assured of his protection. Secondly, incertainties are always odious in Law; for they are the Mother of confusion, whereas the Law expecteth and requireth order: And if the time expressed be alwayes ambigu∣ous, or doubtful, it is careful in the de∣termining and setting of it down cer∣tainly; and for the most part where it is left to her construction, she giveth the longest time for the doing of it, whereby best advantage may be given unto the party which is to do it, the which may be manifest by divers instan∣ces of cases set down in our Books which I do purposely omit to avoid too much prolixity; Wherefore it being the
<PB REF="35"/>
most certain, and the most equal time both for the King and Merchant to have the prisage taken when the Bulk of the Ship is broken; the Law, to whose con∣struction it is left, shall rather ordain the taking of it to be then, than at any o∣ther time; for if the Law should say, that it is a duty presently upon the com∣ing upon the narrow Seas, it should say, it is a duty before such time as the Merchant can assure himself they are his Wines to dispose, insomuch that before the coming into Harbour, they may be swallowed up by the Seas, or he may be dispoiled of them by Enemies unto the King, or Rebels unto the State. And if the Law should determine the duty to the King when the Ships are safely in the Harbour, there might a great incon∣venience ensue upon this Judgement, be∣cause it may very well be, that their course was intended to another place, and they were driven in there only by misadventure, and it would be mis∣chievous to have the Ship rifled, and their Wines disordered, before they had attained unto the intended Haven. Thirdly, this opinion is consonant unto the Judgements in former times; for it
<PB REF="36"/>
was ruled in the case of one <HI>Kenniston,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Kenniston.</NOTE> and <HI>Boggius,</HI> in the fifth year of his Majesties Reign that now is, that prisage shall not be said to be due until such time as the Bulk be broken, and the Ship unladen. And likewise there is a Re∣cord, by which it appeareth, that the King is to have Prisage of every Ship bringing VVine into <HI>England</HI> and un∣laden thereof, so as if it be not unladen then the King by that Record is not to have Prisage. Besides, it appeareth by the Record concerning the payment of Butlerage by the Merchant Aliens, that the King is to have there two shillings of them for every Tun within fourty dayes after the unlading; so as the Law pointeth at the unlading; wheresore this Prisage differing only because the VVines are paid <HI>in specie,</HI> it shall be an Argument thus far to perswade, that the Law will not appoint the time of taking the Wines <HI>in specie</HI> before the unlading, when it giveth for the payment of the two shillings until sourty dayes after the unlading.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it was resolved that how∣soever <NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Whether the King may grant, or discharge Prisage.</NOTE> Prisage of Wines is a Flower of the Crown, yet is it not such an insepar∣able
<PB REF="36"/>
Flower of the Crown, but that it may well enough be granted over, for it is a matter of profit and benefit which is to redound unto the King, and it is not of the nature of a Purachans meerly, for that it is inseperably an∣nexed in privity unto the person of the King, that it may not be granted over. And accordingly it was resolved in the case of Sir <HI>Thomas Vavasor,</HI> who mar∣ried <NOTE PLACE="marg">41. <HI>Elix.</HI></NOTE> one of the Daughters of Alderman <HI>Houghton,</HI> who had a Grant of the Pri∣sage made unto him. And in the 15. of <HI>E.</HI> 4. in the Patent-Rolls it appeareth, that one <HI>Fitzherbert</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg">15 <HI>E</HI> 4. Rot. Pat.</NOTE> a Grant made unto him, and by the same reason that a Grant may be made of Prisage, <HI>à fortiori</HI> may there be a Grant made unto certain persons to discharge them of the payment of it; for it is ea∣sier to make one capable in point of discharge, than by way of Grant, and the Charter made to the Merchants Strangers for the discharge of the pay∣ment of Prisage. And the Statute of 1. <HI>H</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 5. sheweth that a Charter made for the discharge of Prisage, is well, and allowable,</P>
<P>Fifthly, this Grant made unto the <NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Grant to a body po∣litique for the benefit of bodies natural. 39 <HI>E.</HI> 3. 21. 21 <HI>E.</HI> 4. 55.</NOTE>
<PB REF="37"/>
Mayor and Commonalty, and their Suc∣cessors, <HI>Quod de vinis civium nulla prisa fiat,</HI> is good enough, and the grant may well enough be made unto a body poli∣tique, and the benefit of the Patent di∣stributed unto a body natural; for Pa∣tents of that nature are usual in the year-Book of the Common Laws of this our Realm, and never any exception taken unto them when there hath been less warrant in reason to make them good, then there is for this our Patent which we have here in hand: For the City of <HI>London</HI> being the Metropolitan City of this Land, the which may well be called the Heart and Epitome of the whole Realm, and the Chamber of the King, the Merchants whereof do fill the Cof∣fers of the Prince by their customes, and do supply the Subjects of his Majesty with all manner of necessaries, do en∣crease the honour of their Nation by their Commerce, and Traffique abroad, and do strengthen the whole body of it by shipping, which are termed the wooden Walls. It is reason that all Char∣ters made in their favour, and giving them Immunities and Priviledges, should receive a benigne interpretation, and the
<PB REF="37"/>
more especially also, because at this time all Merchants strangers had a Charter of discharge for the payment of prisage, but only that they were to pay two shil∣lings in the Tun; and so if the Mer∣chants of <HI>London</HI> should not have had a Charter of discharge, they would have been discouraged from trading for Wines, because the Merchants strang∣ers would have been able to have afford∣ed their Wines at easier rates, because they were freed of some part of that charge, which the English Merchants were burthened with.</P>
<P>Sixthly, as to the Declaration, what persons shall be discharged of the pay∣ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">6. Whatper∣sons are discharg∣ed by the words of the Char∣ter.</NOTE> of prisage within the words of this Charter, it will be the better manifested by shewing the destinctions and degrees of Citizens which are to be found, for there is mention made of five manner of Citizens. The first of which is, he <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Sort.</HI> Citizens of five sorts.</NOTE> that is a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> for the bear∣ing of offices in the City, and such spe∣cial intents, because he is a Freeman of the City, but he is not a Citizen in resi∣dency and continuance in the City; for he inhabiteth and dwelleth out of the Ci∣ty, and such a Citizen as this, is not
<PB REF="38"/>
such a Citizen as shall enjoy the benefit and priviledge to be discharged of the payment of prisage, according to the resolution given in the Exchequer in the Case of one <HI>Knolls. Trin.</HI> 4. <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>Rot.</HI> 14. where it was ruled, that one that was a Citizen and Freeman of <HI>London</HI> but dwelt in <HI>Bristol,</HI> might not partake of the benefit of this Charter, inso∣much, that he by reason of his dwelling out of the City, was only a Citizen to a special intent. The second sort of <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Sort.</HI></NOTE> Citizens are those which are Citizens in respect of their Freedome, and likewise in regard of residence within the City, but are not such Citizens as do keep a Family and Houshold within the City, but are Inmates and Sojourners, and they do harbour themselves under the Roof of another, and a Citizen of this nature, is not a Citizen which is capable of the Immunity granted by this Char∣ter; for the discharge of payment of prisage, according to the resolution gi∣ven in the Exchequer, in the case of one <HI>Snead</HI> and <HI>Sacheneril. Hill.</HI> 43. <HI>Eliz. Rot.</HI> 22. for such a Citizen is not subject to Scot and Lot, as he that is a housholder, <HI>Et qui non sentit onus, sentire non debet</HI>
<PB REF="38"/>
<HI>commodum.</HI> The third sort of Citizens are those which do inhabit, reside, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. <HI>Sort.</HI></NOTE> keep a Family in the City, but they are not Freemen of the City, so as they may be chosen in any office, and undergo the charge of the City; and as well as the Common Law doth exclude such Citizens for devising Lands in <HI>Mort∣maigne</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">28. Ass. Par. 25.</NOTE> unto the <HI>Guild</HI> of the City, ac∣cording to the custome of the City of <NOTE PLACE="marg">28. Ass. Pat. 18.</NOTE> <HI>London,</HI> as appeareth by divers Book-Cases, as well shall the Common Law ex∣clude them from enjoyning the benefit of the Charter to be discharged of the payment of prisage. The fourth sort of Citizens, are those which are both Ci∣tizens, <NOTE PLACE="marg">4. <HI>Sort.</HI></NOTE> and Freemen, and do reside, and keep family in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and they are not continuing Citizens at such time as the Bulk is broken, and the Ship unladen; for they were disfranchised be∣fore. These Citizens likewise shall not enjoy the exemption granted for the discharge of the payment of Prisage: insomuch that they were not continuing Citizens at that time as the prisage ought to be taken. The fifth sort of Citizens, are those which are both Ci∣tizens, <NOTE PLACE="marg">5. <HI>Sort.</HI></NOTE> and Freemen, and have their fa∣milies
<PB REF="39"/>
and dwelling in <HI>London,</HI> and do continue Citizens at such time as prisage, ought to be taken: Now Citizens of this kind are the real, proper, and na∣tural Citizens intended by this Charter, which are to be discharged of prisage; and therefore a Woman which is a Citi∣zen of this kind, howsoever she can∣not bear offices in the City as a Citize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is yet intended by the Charter: And yet also in some cases, Citizens of this kind shall not be intended within the words of this Charter; and therefore if the Mayor and Commonalty have a joynt Stock of Wines come into the Port of <HI>London,</HI> now prisage shall be ta∣ken of these Wine, not withstanding that every of them in their proper persons Citizens, both <HI>residentiâ, familiâ,</HI> and <HI>continuatione;</HI> for respect is not to be had to their natural bodies, but to their politique body, in which capacity the Charter will not extend to them. So if one at the time, that he fraughteth a Ship, be not a Citizen in all the degrees, now howsoever afterwards before the return of the Ship he be enabled in eve∣ry respect, yet he shall not enjoy the be∣nefit of the Charter, insomuch that he
<PB REF="39"/>
was not so at that time that the Ship was sent abroad.</P>
<P>Seventhly and lastly, what Wines shall be discharged of the payment of <NOTE PLACE="marg">7. What Wines are discharg∣ed of pri∣sage.</NOTE> prisage, it will better appear by the consideration had of the several kinds of properties; and therefore he that shall have his Wines discharged of pri∣sage ought to have a property in them, <HI>quarto modo,</HI> that is, <HI>sibi solùm &amp; sem∣per;</HI> and also he ought to have <HI>jus pos∣sessionis</HI> and <HI>jus proprietatis,</HI> and the one without the other will not serve the turn; and therefore if a Citizen and Forreigner be joynt Merchants for Wines, now the Wines of these joynt Merchants shall not be discharged of the payment of prisage, insomuch that the Citizen hath not a sole property in them, and it may not be distingnished which of the Wines belong unto the Citizen, and which to the Forreigner, because of their joynt interest. But if two Citizens be joynt Merchants or Te∣nants in common of Wines, now these Wines shall be within the compass of the Charter to be discharged of prisage, because they are the Wines of the Citi∣zens of <HI>London,</HI> according to the words
<PB REF="40"/>
and intent of the Charter; howsoever neither of them have a sole interest and property in them. And if a Citizen and Freeman of <HI>London</HI> hath Wines pledged unto him by another Citizen and Free∣man. Now these Wines upon their com∣ing home shall not be discharged of the payment of prisage, insomuch that the Citizen hath only a special property in them, and not any absolute property. So if a Forreigner that hath fraughted Ships beyond the Seas for the bringing of Wines into <HI>England,</HI> doth make a Citizen of <HI>London</HI> his Executor, and die, and the Ship cometh into the Port; now these Wines thus in the custody of the Citizen shall not be discharged of the payment of prisage, for as much as the Citizen hath only a property in the Wines to the use, and behoof of the For∣reigner, and hath not any absolute pro∣perty in the Wines. And if one Citizen of <HI>London</HI> that hath Wines abroad com∣ing into <HI>England,</HI> do make a Forreigner his Executor, and dieth, and this forreign Executor doth imploy the Stock that cometh of these wines so returned home after the death of him that set them forth, and Wines are returned home, now how∣soever
<PB REF="40"/>
these last Wines so returned into <HI>England</HI> are Assets in the hands of the Executor, and in Appellation are the Goods of the first Citizen, yet they are such Wines as are capable of the dis∣charge of prisage within the words of, the Charter, because these Wines came in <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>H.</HI> 8. cap. 5.</NOTE> as it were upon a new contract. And if a Citizen do buy Wines with an intent that a Forreigner upon their coming home shall have these Wines, now these Wines shall not be discharged of prisage, and this deceit of buying them by a Ci∣tizen, shall not any wayes avail him, no more then if a Citizen buy Cloth, in <HI>London</HI> for a Forreigner he shall defeat the custome of Forreign bought, and For∣reign sold, to avoid the Forfeiture of them. So the Wines which a Forreigner buyeth of a Citizen; or that a Citizen buyeth of a Forreigner, shall not be dis∣charged of prisage within the words of the Charter, because they were not the Wines of a Citizen alwayes, from the time of the lading of them, until the time of the unlading of them, as they ought to be.</P>

<PB REF="42"/>
it was ordained, That as well Citi∣zens, as Strangers, should pay, and the King could not grant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to the City; son it is an imposition not al∣lowed by the Law, first against Ci∣tizens; because although the Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be made for the genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good of the City, yet it cannot b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imposed or taxed upon particula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> persons, but upon every House o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but here it is particu∣lar and personal to this part of the City.

And also
<PB REF="42"/>
here is no certain profit to the City, but this taxation is farmed for one and twenty years, for ten shillings a year to the City, which if it were a general charge, there ought to come some general benefit by it to the City. It is not like to the case of Cloth, <HI>Co. part.</HI> 5. <HI>fol.</HI> 62. because that was for the general good of the Realm, and in the furtherance of the Execution of divers Sta∣tutes; but this is neither in furthe∣rance of either Statute, or common Law, but rather to the prejudice of both, because every Citizen, in re∣spect of his Freedome, is equal to the Lord Mayor. And 29. <HI>Eliz.</HI> in the Common Pleas, it was ordained by the <HI>Common Councel,</HI> That none should use any Sand in the City, except it were taken out of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and it was adjudged to be against Law, and the Officer of the Mayor was committed to Prison.

Also the Assessment is to be levied, and to continue for twenty one years together, which is unreasonable; and it hath been ad∣judged here, that an Assessment levied for twenty one years, for re∣parations of a Church, was not lawful. <HI>(Mosley</HI> of <HI>Grays-Inne)</HI> pray∣ed for a <HI>Procedendo,</HI> and said, that it did not appear by the return, that <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate</HI> was a Citizen, and the Judges are not to meddle with any thing which is not within the re∣turn, and he said it was a good By∣law,

Of Fair and Market <HI>(Walter)</HI> was of the same side, this by Law is good: First, it is not against the Rules of Law, nor the Prerogative of the King, nor the benefit of the Sub∣fect; for by the Statute of 4. <HI>H.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 15. 16. that the City of <HI>London</HI> is conservator of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> from <HI>Stanes</HI> to <HI>Yea∣land,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent:</HI> Al∣so by the Statute of 28. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> it is ordained, that the River shall not be stopped, <HI>Ergo</HI> this by Law is for the better execution of those two Acts of Parliament Se∣condly, it is a benefit to the Sub∣ject,

because before, none could any thing there without danger; but now by this means the rubbish is cleansed, and a stranger shall have a quicker and safer return, and the penalty upon the Cloth, in the Case before cited, <HI>Co. part.</HI> 5. is a stronger Case then this is, because Dock hath continue all need to be cleansed; and if such a Tax should be for reparations of the Walls of a City, it would be good: As to the objection, he answered, that as the said Case of <HI>Hallage</HI> cited before, <HI>Co. part.</HI> 5. so this is a general in particular, and the Tax upon the Cloth was to be paid to a particular person, <HI>viz.</HI> the Chamberlain, as here it is, who is a General Offi∣cer for the City.

<P>He becometh bound accordingly un∣to the Major and Commonalty for pay∣ment of the said sum at a certain day, and thereupon is enlarged.</P>
<P>The four hundred Marks are not paid at the day, whereupon the Mayor and

Commonalty affirm a Plaint against him in <HI>London</HI> for the said Debt. The Defendant obtaineth a <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> to remove the body and the cause into the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> upon a supposition that he was to have the Priviledge by reason of a Priority of Suit in the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> and upon returne of the <HI>Habeas Cor∣pus,</HI> all this matter appeared unto the Court, and it was moved by Sir <HI>Henry Mountague,</HI> now Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> then one of the Serje∣ants of the King and Recorder of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> that a <HI>Procedendo</HI> might be granted, whereby the Major, and Commonalty might proceed against him in the Court at <HI>London.</HI> It being a customary Suit meerly grounded upon the custome of <HI>London.</HI> But that was denied by Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Cook</HI> Chief Justice, and the whole Court, because by the Law, <HI>Chamberlain</HI> having cause of Priviledge by reason of the Priority of Suit against him in the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> might not be re-manded; but he was to answer in that Court. Whereupon the Major and Common∣alty did declare against him upon the said Obligation in the <HI>Kings Bench.</HI></P>

Secondly, it was moved that the acti∣on upon this obligation might be laid in some indifferent County, and not in <HI>London;</HI> forasmuch as the Trial there must be had by those that were Parties unto the Action, it being brought by the Mayor and Commonalty.

<HEAD>The Case of the Merchant-Adventu∣rers.</HEAD>
<P>KIng <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the year of his reign by Letters Patents doth incorporate certain persons by the name of the <HI>Merchants-Adventurers of England,</HI> and doth give power unto them to transport <HI>white Clothes</HI> into di∣vers parts beyond the Seas, restrayning them from carrying over <HI>Woolls.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchants-Adventurers do trade beyond the Seas and continue the tran∣sposing of Clothes <HI>white</HI> until the 29. of <HI>August,</HI> in the tenth year of his Ma∣jesties Reign that now is. At which time the King by his Letters Pattents doth encorporate the Earl of <HI>Sussex</HI> late Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Vavasour,</HI> Sir <HI>Stephen Soam, William Cock∣ayn,</HI> and others by the name of <HI>The Mer∣chants Adventerers of the new trade of Lon∣don</HI> with full power &amp; authority to tran∣sport <HI>dyed, and dressed Cloths</HI> into divers parts beyond the Seas, with a restraint prohibiting all the <HI>Old Merchants-Ad∣venturers,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="47"/>
which did not joyn them∣selves unto this new Company to tran∣port any under the forfeiture of them, and also inhibiting the <HI>New Merchants</HI> from transporting any Clothes but such as are died and dressed. And after three years passed, they having power during that time to transport 36000, white Clothes: And there being a refusal of the <HI>Old Merchants Adventurers</HI> to sur∣render up their Patent; The King bring∣eth a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> against divers of the Merchants of the old Company by par∣ticular names, to know by what War∣rant they do without Licence of the King transport Clothes white, undied, and undressed beyond the Seas.</P>
<P>The <HI>Merchants</HI> upon the return of the <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> do make their appear∣ance; And an Information being exhibit∣ed gainst them by Sir <HI>Fr. Bacon</HI> Knight, now Lord Chancellour of <HI>England</HI> and then Attorney General unto his Maje∣sty, cometh into the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> and moveth the Court that the old Merchants Adventurers might have a short day the next ensuing Term, to answer unto the Information exhibited against them. In∣somuch, that the new Company of Mer∣chants
<PB N="38" REF="48"/>
Adventurers standing at a gaze, as being uncertain of what validity the old Patent would be, did slack to trans∣plant the <HI>Diers,</HI> and other Tradesmen out of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> being necessary Instruments for the put∣ing in Execution of this design, because there were not here in <HI>England</HI> those that were able to Die and Dress, in that manner that the <HI>Low-Country</HI> men did. And so there was in the <HI>interim</HI> a stop of the current of Merchandizing with our Cloth, the which being the <HI>principal Commodity</HI> that we had here in <HI>England;</HI> the Fleece that causeth it, may well and aptly have the term of, <HI>The Golden Fleece;</HI> and there being a stop made of the traffiquing and trading with these clothes, it is as dangerous unto the <HI>Po∣litique Body</HI> of the Commonwealth, as the stop of a Vein could be to the natu∣ral Body; for as by the stop of a Vein the Blood is debarred of his free passage, and so of necessity there must be a Con∣sumption by the continuance of it fol∣low unto the body natural: So traf∣fique being the Blood which runneth in the Veins of the Commonwealth, it cannot be but that the hinderance of it
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
by any long continuance, must breed a Consumption unto the State of the Commonwealth; Wherefore, to open this Vein, which was as yet somewhat stopped, and to give a more free passage unto the Blood, he was a Suitor unto the Court, on the behalf of the Compa∣ny of the <HI>New Merchant-Adventurers,</HI> that the Court would give expedition in this Case; for they conceived, that if this new design might take its full effect, as it was intended, it could not be, but of necessity there must a great benefit redound to the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>For first, Whereas our State groweth sick, by reason of the many idle Per∣sons <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Benefits of having Woollen Cloth Di∣ed and dressed in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> which have not means to be set on work, this Dying and Dressing of Cloths within our Kingdome, would give suffi∣cient imployment unto them all, where∣by there should be a cure to the lazy Leprosie, which now overspreadeth our Commonwealth.</P>
<P>Secondly, Whereas now we send out clothes <HI>White,</HI> and the <HI>Low-Country-men</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> receive them of us, and Dye them and Dress them, and afterwards transport them unto forreign parts, making a won∣derful benefit to themselves, both in
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
point of profit, and likewise in respect of maintaining their <HI>Navy;</HI> whereas, if the Clothes were Died and Dressed by our selves, we might reap that matter of gain, and also be Masters of the Sea, by strengthening our selves in our Ship∣ping.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Whereas there happeneth <NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> often a confiscation of all our Clothes, and much disgrace and discredit lighteth upon our Nation, and our Clothes, by the abuse of the <HI>Low-Country-men,</HI> in stretching them a greater length than they will well bear, when they Dye and Dress them; now it should be prevent∣ed, when they should never have the fin∣gering of them, to put that abuse in practice: Wherefore this Patent made by King <HI>Edw.</HI> the 3. bereaving the King and Commonwealth of these great be∣nefits and commodities, is against the Law and so ought to be repealed. And day was given accordingly to put in their Plea.</P>
<P>At which time, many of the old Mer∣chants-Adventurers being willing that trial should be made, whether the be∣nefit intended unto the Commonwealth might be compassed, did shew (to their
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
obedience unto the King, and desire of the good of their Country) Surrender up their Patent into the hands of his Majesty; since which time, it being found by experience that the project had not that success which they expect∣ed, and likewise Cloth and Wooll lay dead, because there was no vent for them abroad: The King according to his power reserved unto him in his Pa∣tent, by which he erected, and created the new Company of Merchants Adven∣turers of <HI>London,</HI> did make repeal and revocation of the said New Patent and new Company, and did redeliver unto the old Merchants their Patent, con∣firming it, and likewise by another Charter did enlarge the Liberties and Priviledges of the old Merchants, by reason of which Grace of the King, the old Company of Merchants-Adventurers of <HI>England</HI> are reestablished in that estate wherein they formerly were, and they do now trade again, as formerly they did, to the great content of the Subject, and benefit of the King and Country.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Certifying Indictments upon</HI> Certio∣raries.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IOhn Forner, Iohn Evans,</HI> and divers o∣thers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hill. 12. <HI>Jac.</HI> Rex K.

<P>That is to say, that King <HI>H.</HI> 6. in the 23. year of his Reign by his Letters Patents, bearing the same date, did grant unto the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> that they should not be com∣pelled upon any Writ directed unto them, to certifie the Indictments themselves, taken before them, but only the Tenors
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
of them, the which they have done ac∣cordingly; and Exception being taken unto this Return for the insufficiency of it; it was resolved by Sir <HI>Edward Cook</HI> Chief Justice of the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Crook,</HI> Sir <HI>Iohn Doddridg,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Haughton,</HI> that the return, upon the reasons hereafter following, was in∣sufficient.</P>
<P>For first, the Letters Patents being granted unto them by the name of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 1.</NOTE> Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of the City of <HI>London,</HI> warranteth only the not certifying of Indictments taken be∣fore them, as Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of <HI>London;</HI> and where the Writ is directed unto them by that name, and they do not excuse them, in Case where the Writ is directed unto them as Justices of <HI>Peace,</HI> and where the In∣dictments are taken before them as Ju∣stices of <HI>Peace,</HI> by virtue of the Kings Commission. And howsoever the Mayor and Aldermen are Justices of Peace by Charter, yet insomuch that they are distinct powers, return made by them by the name of Mayor and Aldermen, where the Writ is directed unto them (as Ju∣stices of Peace) will not be good.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="51"/>
Secondly, there being a Resumption <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Past all Resumpti∣on.</NOTE> made by Act of Parliament in 28. <HI>H.</HI> 6. whereby all Lands, Tenements, Grants, Rent, and Fees granted since the first day of his Reign were resumed; the Letters Patents made in 23. <HI>H.</HI> 6. unto the Mayor and Commonalty, are annihi∣lated and made void, and so no hold may be taken of them; and the Statute made in 1. <HI>Edw.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 1. only confirmes those priviledges not heretofore revoked and repealed by Act of Parliament, or otherwise; and howsoever there be a Charter made by <HI>H.</HI> 7. in the first year of his Reign, whereby restitution was granted of this priviledge, yet no advan∣tage may be taken of it, because it was not spoken of upon the return, and the Court may not intend it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Letters Patents of the King being the sole ground and founda∣tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> to make the return good, are not sufficiently returned unto the Court, in∣somuch that it was said upon the return only, that the King by his Letters Pa∣tents did grant unto the Mayor.

not appear, that they were sealed with the Grand Seal, and if they were not sealed with that Seal, the Letters Pa∣tents may not be of any validity in Law, howsoever they were sealed with the Ex∣chequer Seal, or Dutchy Seal, in respect of which, they may well be called the Letters Pattents of the King.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the use hath alwayes been to remove Indictments, and the Record <NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE> of them upon a <HI>Certiorari</HI> awarded out of the Kings Bench, and there was ne∣ver any denial made of it before this time; and in 5. <HI>Ed.</HI> 6. where a <HI>Certiora∣ri</HI> was directed unto them for the remo∣ving of an Indictment of a Woman which was Indicted for being a common Whore, the Indictment was certified in obedience unto the Writ, although in the end of the return, they shewed their Charter, and prayed that it might be remanded, because it was an In∣dictment only warrantable by the cu∣stome of the City, and not by the Common Law: And the Court was of opinion in the return at the Bar, to have imposed a Fine, and to have awarded a third <HI>Certiorari,</HI> but it was stayed, and the second return was amended.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning Orphans Portions.</HEAD>
<P>THe custome of <HI>London</HI> is, that if a∣ny Freeman deviseth and, or other <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hill. 13. K.

The Widow of a Freeman of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> dwelling in <HI>Middlesex,</HI> bequeathed a Legacy of a thousand pound unto her Daughter after all Debts and Legacies

paid, and upon condition that she should not marry without the as∣sent of her Executor, and maketh a Free∣man her Executor, and dieth. The Exe∣cutor is convented before the Court of Mayor and Aldermen, and required to put in Sureties unto the <HI>Chamberlain</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> according to the Custome for the payment of a thousand pound, ac∣cording unto the time limited by the Will, and according to the Will afore∣said. The Executor denieth to find Sure∣ties; whereupon he was committed to prison, and a <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> being a∣warded out of the Court of <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> to have the Body of the Executor, to∣gether with the cause; all this matter appeareth upon the return. And now it was moved by <HI>Richard Martin</HI> late Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> then an Apprentice of the Law, that the return was insuffi∣cient, and so the Executor ought to be enlarged.</P>
<P>First, in regard that the ground of the imprisonment was the Custome of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rat.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and the custome is against the Law, and void, insomuch that it enforceth an Executor to find Sureties for the pay∣ment of a Legacy, according unto the
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
Will, where the law requireth, that debts be paid, before such time as Legacies be performed; and the Law giveth an ele∣ction unto the Executor, to pay which of the Legacies he will, in case there be not sufficient to pay all the debts and le∣gacies of the Testator; but this excepti∣on was disallowed by the said Court, in∣somuch that the custome of <HI>London</HI> ap∣peareth by the return to be, that he shall find Sureties for the performance of the Legacies according unto the Law of the Realm, and the Will of the Testator: So as if the Executor had not sufficient to pay debts, and legacies, he hath the same power and liberty after such time as he hath found Sureties, as he had before.</P>
<P>Secondly, except on was taken, be∣cause it appeared by the return, that the Devisor was a woman, and also only the Wife of a Freeman, and not a Free-wo∣man, and she is not within the custom of <HI>London,</HI> which only speaketh of a Free∣man. But this exception was over-ruled; for a woman being a Free-woman with∣in the Statute of <HI>Magna Charta cap.</HI> 29. which enacteth, that no Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but by the lawful judgement of his Peers: So that
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
she being a Barroness or Countess shall be tried by her Peers upon an Indictment preferred against her, she shall also be reputed a Freeman within this custome.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Wife of a Freeman ha∣ving the liberty and priviledge to Trade in the City, and so able to take benefit by it, she shall also be bound by the cu∣stomes of it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, howsoever she was dwelling out of <HI>London</HI> at the time of the Will made, she is a Freeman within the com∣pass of the custome.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it was objected, that this custome of <HI>London</HI> concerning Orphans, was an antiquated custome, and had not been put in use by many years, and there∣fore ought not now to be put in ure to take away the liberty of a man, and especially also, because the life of a cu∣stome is the usage; but this exception was over-ruled, for this custome is day∣ly put in Ure.</P>

That <HI>London</HI> is an ancient City, and, that time out of mind of man, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> have had Conusans of all manner of

And exception being taken to the insufficiency of this return, it was agreed and resolved by the whole Court of Kings Bench, that this return made, was ill; for common experience teacheth, that the usual course is, and alwayes hath been, that upon <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> the body, together with the cause, have been removed out of <HI>London,</HI> into the Kings Bench; and likewise upon <HI>Certio∣raries</HI> awarded out of the Kings Bench.

bedience unto the Writs awarded out of that Court, as the Supetiour Court; but if the cause should be such, that there should be a failer of Justice in the Kings Bench upon the removing of the cause, because it is only an action grounded meerly upon the custome of <HI>London,</HI> then a return made of the spe∣cial matter will be warrantable; or o∣therwise if the return be made, that the custome of <HI>London</HI> is, that no cause, which is a meer customary cause, wherein no remedy can be had but only in <HI>London,</HI> according unto the custome of <HI>London,</HI> may well be allowed, so as the cause specially be returned into the Court, whereby it may appear unto the Court, that it is such a cause, which will not bear action at the Com∣mon Law; for it is usual in the Kings Bench, that if the cause returned unto the Court upon the <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> ap∣pear to be such a cause as will bear an action only by the custome, and not at the Common Law, the Court will grant a <HI>Procedendo,</HI> and send it back again to <HI>London,</HI> as if the cause returned, ap∣pear to be an action of Debt brought upon <HI>concesit se solvere,</HI> or to be an a∣action

<P>Fifthly, whether this reservation of twenty five pounds by the year, by way <NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE> of fine and income, shall be adjudged to be a rent within the intent and mean∣ing

of the Statute an Decree, or no?</P>
<P>Sixthly, who shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be Judge of the Tithes for houses in <HI>London?</HI> and the re∣medy for the Parson, in case that pay∣ment be not made unto him, according to the Decree.</P>
<P>As to the first part, which is, whether by the Common Law, any thing can be <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. What the Parson may by Law de∣mand for houses in <HI>London? Fitz. Herb. nat. brev. fol.</HI> 53.</NOTE> demanded for the houses in <HI>London?</HI> It is to be agreed, and clear that nothing can be demanded. For that which the Parson ought to demand of houses, is Tythes; and it is improper, and cannot be, that Tythes can be paid of houses. First, in regard that houses do not in∣crease, and renew, but rather decrease for want of reparations, and Tythes are not to be paid of any thing, but such things as do increase, and renew; as it appeareth by the Levitical Law, and the Common Law of the Land. Secondly, houses are matters of inheritance, where∣of a <HI>praecipe</HI> lieth at the Common Law. And the rent reserved upon a Lease made of them, is likewise knit unto the inhe∣ritance, and parcel of it; so that it shall go along unto him that hath the inheri∣ritance; and therefore shall descend un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Heir: and it is a rule in Law that
<PB N="61" REF="59"/>
Tythes are not to be paid of part of the Inheritance, but they ought to be paid of such things as renew; upon which reason it is that Tythes by the Com∣mon Law of the Land are not to be paid of Slate, Stone, and Cole digged out of the Pit. Thirdly, houses being built only for the receiving, habitation, and dweling of men, and for conveni∣ency of protection against the scorching Heats in Summer, and tempestuous Storms in Winter, without any profit at all redounding unto the owner. And the Parson being to have a benefit o∣therwise, in the payment of personal Tythes arising through his industry in the house, no Tythes can be demanded for the houses themselves, or for the rent reserved upon them. Fourthly, the Decree made 38. <HI>H.</HI> 8. which exempteth the houses of Noblemen from the pay∣ment of any rate-Tythes, sheweth the Common Law to be, so that houses of themselves are to be discharged of the payment of Tythes, and accordingly it <NOTE PLACE="marg">34. <HI>Eliz. Dawsons</HI> case K. Bench.</NOTE> hath been adjudged in divers cases hap∣ning at the Common Law: that Tythes by the course of the Common Laws may not be demanded for houses, but they are to be discharged.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="60"/>
As to the second point, which is, whe∣ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> custom can establish a right of pay∣ment of any thing unto the Pason for houses? It is clear that it may well e∣nough: for it may well be, that before such time as any house was built upon the ground where the house stood, there had been a summe of money paid for the profits of the ground in the name of a <HI>modus decimandi,</HI> and so howsoever the house is built upon the ground, yet the <HI>modus</HI> continues, and is not taken a∣way by it; and so there being a conti∣nuance of payment of the <HI>modus</HI> after the building of the house, time hath made it to be a payment for the house. But this payment is to be termed a <HI>modus decimandi,</HI> and cannot be well called a Tithe paid for houses, because as it is formerly said, Tithes may not be paid for houses; and all this appeareth by <NOTE PLACE="marg">11. Re∣port. sol. 16.</NOTE> Doctor <HI>Grants</HI> case in the eleventh Re∣port.</P>
<P>As to the third point, which is, what <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. What was anciently paid for houses in <HI>London</HI> to the Par∣son.</NOTE> was anciently paid by the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> unto the Ministers of <HI>London</HI> and how the payment grew? It appear∣eth by the Records of <HI>London,</HI> that <HI>Ni∣ger</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> 13. <HI>H.</HI> 3. made a
<PB N="63" REF="60"/>
Constitution in confirmation of an an∣cient custome formerly used time out of mind, that provision should be made for the Ministers of <HI>London</HI> in this man∣ner, that is to say, that he which pay∣eth <NOTE PLACE="marg">And how these pay∣ments grew <HI>Niger</HI> Bishop of <HI>London's</HI> Constitu∣tion. 13. H. 3.</NOTE> the rent of twenty shillings for his house wherein he dwelt, should offer e∣very Sunday, and every Apostles day, whereof the Evening was fasted one half-penny: and he that paid but ten shillings rent yearly, should offer but one farthing; and all this amounted un∣to but according to the proportion of 2. sh. 6. d. <HI>per</HI> pound: for there were fifty two Sundayes, and but eight Apo∣stles dayes, the Vigils of which were fasied. And if it chanced that one of the Apostles dayes fell upon a Sunday, then there was but one half-penny, or farthing paid; so that sometime it fell out to be less by some little then 2. sh. 6. d. <HI>per</HI> pound: and it appeareth by our Book-cases in <HI>Edward</HI> the third his <NOTE PLACE="marg">30. <HI>E.</HI> 3 i.</NOTE> Reign, that the provision made for the <NOTE PLACE="marg">30. L. 3. 3.</NOTE> Ministers of <HI>London</HI> was by offerings and obventions, howsoever the particulars are not designed there, but must be un∣derstood according to the former Or∣dinance made by <HI>Niger,</HI> and the pay∣ment
<PB N="64" REF="61"/>
of 2. sh. 6. d. in the pound, con∣tinuing until 13. K. <HI>Ric.</HI> 2. <HI>Thomas A∣rundel.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tho Arun</HI> Arch-bish. of <HI>Cant.</HI> 13. <HI>R.</HI> 2.</NOTE> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> made an explanation of the constitu∣tion made by <HI>Niger,</HI> and thrust upon the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> two and twenty o∣ther Saints days then were meant by the constitution made by <HI>Niger,</HI> whereby the Offerings now amounted unto the summe of 3. sh. 5. d. <HI>per</HI> pound; against which explanation there being some re∣luctation by the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> in 5. <HI>H.</HI> 4. granted his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pope <HI>In∣nocent.</HI> 5. <HI>H.</HI> 4.</NOTE> <HI>Bull,</HI> whereby the former explanation was confirmed; which confirmation, notwithstanding the difference between the Ministers and Citizens of <HI>London</HI> a∣bout those two and twenty Saints dayes which were added unto their number, Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> by his <HI>Bull</HI> in 31. <HI>H.</HI> 6. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pope <HI>Nich.</HI> 31. <HI>H.</HI> 6.</NOTE> made a second confirmation of the ex∣planation made by the said Arch-Bishop: Against which the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> did contend with so high a hand that they caused a Record to be made, where∣by it might appear in future Ages, that the Order of explanation made by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was done without calling the Citizens of <HI>London</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="61"/>
unto it, or any consent given by them. And it was branded by the name of an Order surrepritiously, and abruptiously gotten and therefore more fit to have the name of a destructory then a decla∣ratory Order: the which contending not∣withstanding, as it seemeth the pain was most usually made according unto the rate of 3. sh. 5. d. in the pound; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Linwood,</HI> fol. 146.</NOTE> for <HI>Linwood,</HI> who writ in the time of K. <HI>H.</HI> 6. in his Provincial Constitutions de∣bating the question, whether the Mer∣chants and Artificers of the City of <HI>London</HI> ought to pay any Tythes? shew∣eth, that the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> by an ancient Ordinance observed in the said City are bound every Lords day, and every principal Feast-day, either of the Apostles, or others whose Vigils are fast∣ed to pay one farthing for every ten shil∣lings rent, that they paid for their houses wherein they dwelt; and in 36. <HI>H.</HI> 6. there was a composition made between the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> and the Ministers of <HI>London,</HI> that a payment should be made by the Citizens according unto the rate of 3. sh. 5. d. in the pound, and if any house were kept in the proper hand of the owner, or were demised
<PB N="66" REF="62"/>
withoutreservation of any rent; Then the Churchwardens of the Parish, where the houses were, should set down a rate of the houses, and according unto that rate and payment should be made. After which composition so made, there was an Act of Common Councel made 14. <HI>E.</HI> 4. in <HI>London,</HI> for the confirmation of the <HI>Bull</HI> granted by Pope <HI>Nicholas.</HI> But the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> finding that by the Common Lawes of the Realm, no <HI>Bull</HI> of the Pope, nor Arbitrary compo∣sition, nor Act of Common Councel could bind them in such things as con∣cerned their inheritance; They still wresiled with the Clergy, and would not condes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end unto the payment of the said elevenpence by the year, obtruded upon them by the addition of the two and twenty Saints days, whereupon there was a submision unto the Lord Chan∣cellour, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Submissi∣on to the Lord Chancel∣lour and Privy-Councel.</NOTE> and divers others of the Privy Councel, and they made an Order for the payment of Tythes according unto the rate of 2. sh. 9. d. in the pound: the which Order was first promulgated by a Proclamation made, and afterwards established by an Act of Parliament made 17. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 21. in confirmation <NOTE PLACE="marg">27. <HI>H.</HI> 8. 21. <HI>cap.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="67" REF="62"/>
of which said Order there was a Decree made 37. <HI>H.</HI> 8. with some further addi∣tions, the which said Decree was con∣firmed <NOTE PLACE="marg">37. <HI>H.</HI> 8. decree, cap. 12.

So as it appeareth by that which hath been formerly said, that the first payment was only accord∣ing unto the rate of 2. sh. 6. d. <HI>per</HI> pound; afterward, the payment was increased to the rate of 3. sh. 5. d. <HI>per</HI> pound: and lastly, there was an abatement and pay∣ment made only according to the rate of 2. sh. 9. in the pound. The first pay∣ment grewby Custome, the second by Constitutions, and <HI>Bulls</HI> of the Pope; the last by Decree in the <HI>Chancery.</HI></P>
<P>As to the fourth part, which is, whe∣ther this twenty five pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Whether the Fine paid, by 25. <HI>Per. An.</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a rent with∣in the words of the de∣cree?</NOTE> reserved by way of sine and income, be a rent within the words of the Decree, or Statute, or not? It was clearly agreed, and resolved, that it was not a rent. For it may not be said either a rent-service, rent-charge, or rent-seck; and there are only three manner of Rents, <HI>Et ar∣gumentum à divisione fortissimum.</HI> Se∣condly, it hath not the properties and qualities of a Rent; for it shall not be incident to the reversion of the house to
<PB N="68" REF="63"/>
pass, or descend with it, it shall not be extinguished by the purchase of the house not suspended by an entry in the house, nor apportioned by an eviction of part of the house. Thirdly, the party himself in his Indenture of Lease hath called it a Fine, and Income, and hath expressed the days of payment for it, as a Fine and Income; and there∣fore now it may not well be said to be a rent either in the judgement of the Common Laws, or Ecclesiastial Laws, or in common accepration.</P>
<P>As to the fifth part which is, whether this twenty five pounds by the year, thus <NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Whether the 25 <HI>per∣ann.</HI> thus Covenan∣ted to be paid for fine, be lent with∣in the in∣tent of the decree? 1. Argu∣ments on Ministers part.</NOTE> reserved upon a Covenant by way of Fine and Income, be a rent within the intent and meaning of the Decree made 37. K, <HI>H</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 12? It was conceived by those that argued on the behalf of the Ministers of <HI>London,</HI> upon the rea∣sons hereafter following that the reser∣vation of twenty five pounds by the year, by way of Income, was a rent with∣in the meaning of the Decree, and that the Plaintiff ought to have the rate-Tythes paid unto him, according to the proportion of thirty pounds by the year, and not according unto the rate of five
<PB N="69" REF="63"/>
pounds by the year only; First, in re∣gard that this Fine being profit which ariseth by reason of the house, and be∣ing payable at the same times, that the first five pounds (which without questi∣on is a rent) is payable, and upon the same conditions may well be said a rent; both out of the Etymology of the word, by common acceptation of the thing, by the judgement both of Common Laws, and of the Laws of the Church and so is a rent within the intent of the Decree; and the nameing of it a Fine, or Income shall not cause an evasion out of the Law. Secondly, this Decree, and Act of Parliament being made for the avail of the Church, and setling of the reve∣nue thereof; shall have as liberal con∣struction to give life unto the true in∣tent and meaning of it, as may be, and the slight of payment of it, as a gross sum by way of Fine and Income upon a Covenant made by <HI>Goff</HI> the Leassee, shall not defeat the good provision made by the Decree. Thirdly, this 2. sh 9 d. in the pound being the labourers hire, and given him in satisfaction and recom∣pence of all manner of Tythes, either personal, predial, or mixt, the Decree
<PB N="70" REF="64"/>
made concerning it, ought to be extend∣ed and enlarged so far, as by reason∣able exposition it may, and is not any wayes to be restrained, whereby to give way to any cautelous provision made by the party. Fourthly, the Common Law, and Statutes having all with one voice, condemned fraud, covin, and deceit used in any manner of kind or way, and ban∣dying themselves against it, whereby to extirpate and root it out of the hearts of all; and to prevent it from being put in Ure in the actions of any man; It is great reason in this case, which con∣cerneth God, the Church, Religion, and Learning, to suppress all manner of Acts which may any way have a taste, or touch of fraud. Wherefore this Fine, or Income thus reserved by way of Co∣venant, having the appearance of fraud, shall be taken to be a rent, within the intent, and meaning of the Decree; and way shall not be given to this device, whereby to defeat the Church and Mi∣nisters <NOTE PLACE="marg">Argument on the Ci∣tizens part.</NOTE> of it of their due. But those that argued on the behalf of the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> were of opinion that this Fine, and Income was not within the intent and meaning of the Decree; for the De∣cree
<PB N="71" REF="64"/>
being that the Citizens and Inhabi∣tants of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Liber∣ties of the same for the time being shall yearly for ever without fraud, or covin, pay their Tythes to the Parsons, Vicars, Curates of the said City and their Suc∣cessors for the time being, after the rate hereafter following; that is, to wit, of every ten shillings rent by the year, of all, and every House, and Houses, Shops, Warehouses, Cellars, and Stables within the said City, and Liberty of the same, sixteen pence half-penny, and of every 20. sh. rent of all and every such House, and Houses, Shops, Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>houses, Cellars, and Stables within the said City, and Li∣berties, 2. sh. 6. d. and so above the rate of twenty shillings by the year, ascend∣ing from ten shillings to ten shillings ac∣cording to the rate aforesaid. And where any Lease is, or shall be made of any dwelling house or houses, shops, ware∣houses, cellars, or stables or any of them, by fraud, or covin, reserving less rent then hath been accustomed, or is, or that any such Lease shall be made without any rent reserved upon the same by reason of any Fine, or Income paid before hand or by ay fraud, or covin, that then, and in
<PB N="72" REF="65"/>
every such case the Tenant or Farmer; Tenants or Farmers thereof shall pay his or their Tythes of the same, accord∣ing to the quantity of such rent, or rents, as the same house, or houses, shops, ware∣houses, cellars, stables, or any of them were last letten, without Fraud or Covin, before the making of such a Lease. It ap∣peareth that the Decree aimeth at a rent, and not at a Fine, or Income, for within the words above mentioned, it appear∣eth that there is a difference, and distin∣ction made between a Fine, and an In∣come, and the intent of the maker of the Decree, is best drawn and under∣stood by the words of the Decree, where∣fore the Party Leassee having expressed himself that this twenty five pounds by the year, shall be paid in name of a Fine, and Income. And the Decree it self shewing that by reason of a Fine, or In∣come, less rent is reserved, it may not be said that this twenty five pounds by the year, shall be a rent within the mean∣ing of the Decree, when there is a rent of five pounds also reseserved, beside this Income. Secondly, this Decree made in 37. <HI>H.</HI> 8. being penal unto the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> because it inflicteth imprison∣ment
<PB N="73" REF="65"/>
upon him, upon his non-payment of his Tythe according to the rent re∣served, and being also in advantage of the Ministers of <HI>London</HI> because, by ver∣tue of this Decree, the Minister is to have according to the rate of 2. sh. 9. d. in every twenty shillings, where ancient∣ly he had but 2. s. 6. d. it is no reason to extend it by equity, and to construe that to be a rent within the intent and mean∣ing of the Decree, which of it self is a Fne, or Income. Thirdly, there never hauing been above the rent of five <NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> pounds by the year, reserved upon any Lease made, it cannot be taken to be any covin, or collusion. When the ancient rent is reserved, insomuch, that now so much as the Law requireth, is done and besides where the Common Law or Sta∣tute Law shall take notice of a Fraud, it ought to be in case where the thing in which the Fraud, or deceit was supposed, is formerly in being; for a Fraud may not be committed to a person, or thing not in being. Fourthly, it is to be re∣served, so that if no rent at all had been reserved, there might not any more have been demanded, but only according to the rate of the rent, which was last re∣served
<PB N="74" REF="66"/>
for the houses; wherefore the an∣cient rent of 5. l. being here reserved, it cannot be, that within the intent and meaning of the Decree there can be more rate-Tythes demanded, then ac∣cording to that rent. And besides the very words of the Decree, intimates that there is no fraud within the mean∣ing of the Decree, but only where by reason of the Fine, or Income, there is not rent at all reserved, or a less rent then was anciently reserved; where∣sore in the Case at the Barre, the old rent being reserved, there may be no fraud at all.</P>
<P>As to the sixth, and last part, which is, who shall be Judge of the payment of Tythes for houses in <HI>London,</HI> and the remedy for the recovery of them? It is apparent out of the words of the De∣cree, that the Mayor of the City of <HI>London</HI> is Judge, and is to give or∣der concerning them; and Suit is not to be made in the Ecclesiastical Court for them; and if it be, a Prohibiti∣on is to be granted, insomuch, that the party grieved resorteth unto an∣other Judge then the Statute hath ap∣pointed. But if the Mayor do not
<PB N="75" REF="66"/>
give aid within two moneths after com∣plaint made, or do not give such aid as is fitting; then resort is to be made unto the Lord Chancellour of <HI>England,</HI> who hath three moneths given him for ending of the said Cause.</P>
