<HEAD>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Haue obserued (gentle Reader) from the words and writings of the learned, that it is a Maxime or Rule in Philosophie; <HI>Finis est primus in intentione,</HI> The end aymed at is first setled in the intention of man: And finding this Romanist to boast and brag much of his learning, it is not vnlike, that like a cunning Clerke (whatsoeuer his lear∣ning be) the ende of this his worke was the first ground of his writing.</P>
<P>He proclaimeth Temperance in his title, he pursueth the Art of Rayling in the whole processe following, and in the end of all, he perswadeth ruine both to Church and Com∣mon-wealth: In the first dissimulation, in the second scurri∣litie, and the third trecherie is contained; for he shakes handes with Temperance at the verie first, and leaueth her to rest and remaine with his title, and the leafe being tur∣ned he plungeth presently into his vaine of rayling, which (if he had affected Temperance) he would neuer haue done, and the end sheweth his intention to be to bring in either a tolleration or flat alteration of Religion.</P>
<P>But wilt thou know (Christian Reader) what forced this fellow to become so suddenly distempred? My <HI>Watch-word</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
presented vnto thee to prepare thee with a couragious heart, and readie hand, to resist forraine malice, and home treason, plotted and purposed by <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spayne,</HI> a∣gainst our Soueraigne and Countrie, hath wakened him be∣fore his time, and out of the lightnesse of his braine (through ouer-watching of himselfe to deuise and worke mischiefe) he tearmeth this my booke (in the beginning of his Preface) an iniurious Pamphlet and a <HI>biting Libell</HI>: my la∣bours therein he calleth a base exercise of calumniation and rayling, and in the matter thereof it pleaseth him to say; I spare neither God nor man, <HI>So farre forth as they con∣cerne the Catholike cause, or the cause of them,</HI> and for this I must receiue my checke and refutation at his pleasure.</P>
<P>The iniurie he chargeth me to haue done is to his Catho∣likes, of whose doctrine and dealing I confesse (in my former booke) I warne thee to beware: as for the tearme of a byting Libell, thou wilt say (gentle Reader) when thou hast peru∣sed him and me both ouer, that it is a more fit addition to the title of his temperate <HI>Ward-word</HI> which is byting, be∣cause it is full of rayling, and is a Libell, because it is slaun∣derous against her Maiestie, and the seat of her Iustice, and is thrust out without name: as for the basenes of the exer∣cise imputed to me for writing and publishing that booke, and the cause thereof, indeed it is a verie base thing to ca∣lumniate, and rayle as he doth; but to lay before Subiects the doctrine and deeds of disloyaltie, and to warne them to take heed thereof, as I haue endeuoured therein to doe, will proue neither calumniation nor rayling.</P>
<P>If any simple seduced Catholike stand free from subscri∣bing to the disloyal doctrine of <HI>Rome,</HI> &amp; from doing that it directeth and teacheth, he is not touched by me; therefore
<PB REF="3"/>
this Champion that draweth all Catholikes within the com∣passe of my words wrongeth them more then I doe: but he might haue spared to name the God of heauen, as a partie in his Catholike cause, till he can proue the cause warranted from God, and his truth, which he shall neuer do; yet I must receiue this worthie Gentlemans checke for my labour, but he shall find it is farre from a mate, and that his Bishops are too weake to bring it to that.</P>
<P>The Gentleman saith he is verie loath to be ouer eager and sharpe with me in his Encounters, not onely in his owne worshipfull disposition, but also for the reuerent respect he carrieth to the house and family I come of, and the particu∣ler affection he feeleth towards some of my name and li∣nage; but this is no sooner vttered then that he breaketh out presently into these words: <HI>Who will not confesse but that lying, forging, and falsifying, ignorant vaun∣ting, odious scoffing, malicious calumniations, se∣ditious interpretations, bloudie exaggerations, bar∣barous insultations, ouer them that alreadie are in af∣fliction and calamitie, ought to be farre from the na∣ture, pen and tongue of a Knight or Gentleman?</HI> And who would haue thought that so temperate a title could haue afforded so vntemperate a stile? Againe, who would haue expected such raging and rayling Rhetoricke a∣gainst me from one of so milde a disposition, as he professeth to be of, and that caried so reuerend a respect to the family whereof I am a braunch, and such a feeling affection to some of my name as he would perswade? But he hath cut the throate of his temperate title, and procl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imeth intempe∣rance in his whole booke, and I doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> breake the strength of his chiefe wards (for all his fencing skill if he meane to play the fencer) and to leaue him altogether to his
<PB REF="4"/>
hanging-ward, which proueth alwaies a dangerous ward if it be sharpely followed by the assaylant, but for his reuerent respect to my family and his affection to some of them (which surely I thinke it verie slender and scunt sounde to any of them) I would aduise him not to lie so open, but to betake him to a stronger and sounder ward least be catch a double venue for his labour.</P>
<P>But he is prouoked by me to breake out into choler for that I not onely (saith he) <HI>Touch the honours, states, and liuings of home-borne subiects, and bring them into question, vniustly being no waie tollerable, but rush further to the open assault of forraine Monar∣chies, also their honours, fame and reputations which is lesse tollerable, and consequently hath neede of some more sharpe and forcible reiection.</HI> The former persons meant by him are made apparant before, and there∣fore of them I onely say this in this place, I wish them all from my heart, that as they are home-borne, so they may be home-hearted Subiects, that their Soueraigne and countrie may enioye them sound English Subiects indeed: as for his Monarches of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spayne</HI> hee hath no cause to carpe at me, but to blame themselues, for it is they, and not I that haue teinted their honours, fame, and reputations, the first of them hauing long sought to depose her Maiestie from her regall and supreame right within her owne Domi∣nions, the other hauing made attempts to inuade and make a conquest of her land, and both of them hauing conspired the death of her Maiestie by setting on both bastard borne, English and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h strangers to depriue her of life, this I confesse I lai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in my former booke, and for this am I fiercely assaulted by this f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous Romanist in his vntempe∣rate <HI>Ward-word</HI>; but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in discouering, or he in de∣fending
<PB REF="4"/>
deserue more blame, I leaue (gentle Reader) to thy wise and indifferent iudgement.</P>
<P>The violence of the <HI>Puritane</HI> spirit is added by him for a reason why he is prouoked by me, by which words (for all his difference made betweene <HI>Protestant</HI> and <HI>Puritane</HI>) both of them are apparantly knowne to professe Christ Iesus crucified in religion, and in true Christian pollicie to condemne Subiects that shall denie or breake their oath of fealtie; and alleageance to their Soueraigne, for the pleasing of any earthly power or Potentate whatsoeuer, and not to fa∣uour eyther Prince or Pope that shall vsurpingly challenge our Soueraignes princely titles from her, or ambitiously seeke by inuasion to dispossesse her of her kingdome, or trecherously practise by violence or any waies else to depriue her of life; so that though he disioyne vs in tearmes and names, yet he shall assuredlie finde wee all ioyne in condemning disloyaltie in subiects, ambition in forraine Princes and Potentates, and trecherie, and treason in any of them all against the State and person of the Lords annoynted: and of this num∣ber that carrie this minde, I professe my selfe most willingly and gladly to be one.</P>
<P>This Encounterer seemeth to glorie that the yeares of her Maiestie growe on fast, but the God of mercie I trust will prolong her daies to the holding out stil of the Popes vsurped authoritie, and superstitious doctrine, to the suppressing of traitours, and treasons, and to the daunting and ouer∣throw of any, that shall attempt by fraud or force to bring in or maintaine either; for from these onely come the gar∣boyles by which our State hath beene disquieted, and our Soueraigne endangered, and from these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gers the Lord of might and mercie preserue her still. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>fore (gentle
<PB REF="5"/>
Reader) you may see that neither Sir <HI>Francis</HI> nor any <HI>Pro∣testant</HI> nor <HI>Puritane</HI> are fit subiects for this seditious fellow to worke vpon, to set on foote his desired garboyles, as this <HI>Machiuilian witted Romanist</HI> seemeth propound (but most iniuriously) to put his owne, and his adherents traite∣rous practises out of memory, which are so plentifull in num∣ber, and so manifest in fact as they can neuer be forgotten.</P>
<P>After all this he layeth extreame flatterie to my charge, both of the State, and her Maiesties person in particular, which extreame charge of his (for he is all in his extreames) because it is redoubled vpon me, giue me leaue to referre thee (gentle Reader) to my answere thereunto, in my resistance to his first Encounter, only where he termeth this flattery by him supposed against me) <HI>to be a fit bait for such hooks as angle after popular fauour for a further fetch</HI>: my popularity onely consisteth in this, to haue loyalty, stand sound and vpright, and all trechery and treason suppressed. But if it please thee (Christian Reader) to obserue well this Gentlemans smooth Remitter to the Lords after his thun∣dring Encounters against me, with his fawning perswasion of peace, and crouching sute for tolleration or alteration of Religion (which before I affirme to be the first matter in his intention, and iustly call the ruine of our Church and Com∣mon-wealth) thou wilt easely perceiue what baytes he hookes withall, and what good he angles after vnder the sugred and sweet names of peace, &amp; vnity, wheras the good of our peace standeth vpon a good peace, &amp; vnlesse our peace may be free from present and plaine danger, it can promise little present or future good: and for his vnitie if it be vnity in veritie (as his is not) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eligious Christian man can, or will refuse it; but praise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for it, and (if our vnthankfulnes bereaue
<PB REF="5"/>
vs not of it) we enioy that already by and vnder her Ma∣iestie with great comfort, and both of her and it would this masked Romanist most gladly see vs depriued: Notwith∣standing all his fawning and crouching to the Honoura∣ble Lords in his Remitter, their wisedomes (I doubt not) will easely finde out this subtile <HI>Synons</HI> intention, who shameth not with a brasen face to seeke to bring in his brasen horse, loaden with armed calamities for Englands ruine. I haue vndertaken this Popish Champion not with any purpose to follow him in his vaine of rayling, for therein I finde him not matchable, nor hauing a disposi∣tion or desire to be stirring in matter of this nature, being more fit to be dealt in by men qualified with farre greater giftes of learning and art then I am, but being called as it were into the field by him, I haue aduentured vpon the height of his swelling pride, and haue shaped him a plaine and sound answere to all the materiall points culled out of my former booke &amp; excepted against by him, in which (how vainegloriously soeuer this proud Encounterer promiseth to himselfe victorie) I hope (Christian Reader) thou shalt find me fully cleared and freed from the force and fury of his false imputations, and byting blowes, and him directly pro∣ued a blind superstitious Papist in Religion, a false hear∣ted subiect to his Soueraigne, and a man wholy degenerate from the honest affection of a true Englishman. And this being performed and finished, (which I held my selfe bound in duty to doe, for thy satisfying and mine owne cre∣dit) my full resolution is not to toyle any more by contending with such rayling and wrangling spirits. And so (retur∣ning all his vniust imputations against me, with his tearmes of fictions and calumniations set downe in the end of his
<PB REF="6"/>
Epistle to himselfe, from whom they came) I leaue the scope and ende of vs both to be found out by thy Christi∣an wisedome, and the carriage of vs both to be censured as in the vprightnesse of thy iudgemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, thou shalt finde we deserue. To our good God I commend thee, and will now hasten to ioyne the combate with this proud Romanist touching his Encounters seuerally, and as shortly as possibly I can.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Resistance to the first Encounter about the manifold bles∣sings, from God, through her Maiesties happie Raigne, powred vpon this Land.</HEAD>
<P>THough my intent is not to make answere eyther to the immo∣dest raylings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The scope of this Apologie.</NOTE> or friuolous ex∣ceptions, or vagrant excursions of this <HI>Encounterer</HI>; but onely to set downe a short defence of my speeches by him impugned (because my state of health, and disposition of my bodie will not beare to write vo∣lumes:) yet, because both in the entrance of this <HI>Libell,</HI> and in other places of his processe, he doth so hainously charge me with the odious crime of flat∣terie (which I hate naturally as a badge of a base mind, much more through Christian knowledge as most contrarie thereto,) I haue thought it not a∣misse to shape a short answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vnto it. In suspition of heresie <HI>Ierome</HI> (as Bishop <HI>Iuell</HI> alleadgeth) would haue no man to be patient, &amp; though I will not burst
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
out into any impatience (as considering more what is fit for me to speake then for him to heare) yet I hold that in the grieuous accusation of flatterie I ought not to be silent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Flatterie false∣ly charged vp∣on me.</NOTE>Therefore I allow it not onely for wittie, but worthie to be imbraced for truth, that which you al∣leadge concerning flatterers, &amp; I hold the answere to the question no lesse true in the whole, then in part. The question was, <HI>What beasts were most perilous?</HI> And the answere is, <HI>Of all wilde-beastes a Tyrant, &amp; of tame-beastes a flatterer</HI>; and if you can as easily free such as you seeke with might and maine to defend, from the iust imputation of tyranny, as I shall be able to cleare my selfe from any the least intention to flatter, you shall doe more then euer any could doe for them before.</P>
<P><HI>Antisthenes</HI> is reported to be wont to say, he <HI>had rather haue rauens resort to his house then flatterers,</HI> yeel∣ding this reason, that rauens do but pray vpon the carcasse being dead, but flatterers deuoure both bodie and soule aliue. To enterprise the enumerati∣on of great States and Princes through flatterers vt∣terly ruinated, were to vndertake an endles labour but as the verse hath:
<Q><L>Blanditiae plusquam dira venena nocent,</L>
<L>Sugred and sweet flatter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>teth more,</L></Q></P>
<P>Then deadly poyson th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gh thou drink great store. So were it not hard to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew more seigniories and kingdomes subuerted by secret flatterie, then by o∣pen hostilitie: by how much the more earnestly I beseech the Lord, that if her Maiesties Court can∣not be altogether free from flatterers (who as burres
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
doe commonly hang vpon the sleeues of Princes,) yet by her princely wisedome she may alwaies espie them, and finde them out, saying as the Philosopher is reported that was Nephew to <HI>Plato. Define adu∣lari, nihil enim proficis cum te intelligam,</HI> leaue thy flea∣ring and fawning, thou preuailest nothing, for I per∣ceiue thee well enough.</P>
<P>But I pray you (Sir <HI>N. D.</HI>) where learned you that skill to take vpon you to affirme and proue, that to publish the commendation of Princes vpon iust desert is flatterie?<NOTE PLACE="marg">What flatte∣rie is.</NOTE> I doubt me for all your desire to be thought a great Clerke, it will trouble you and all your colleagues to fortifie this position But not to dwell long vpon this point; disdaine not to heare what <HI>Democritus</HI> will tell you. <HI>Rectè quidem facta lau∣dare honestum est, mala verò laudibus vehere adulterini est animi &amp; impostoris.</HI> To giue due praise to good de∣serts is honest; but to praise and extoll euill deeds ar∣gueth a corrupt and a couzening mind: and there∣fore I doubt not with farre more ease to free my selfe from flatterie, wherewith you falsely charge me for commending the good things of our land, then you shalbe able to auoid the iust imputation of an adulte∣rous and deceiuing mind in deprauing Gods bles∣sings with your Macheuilian wit, and false inter∣pretations.</P>
<P>And if I had leasure to stand vpon iust retortion of vniust accusations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arch flatte∣rers at Rome.</NOTE> I could send you to the Popes Pallace where a man may finde more shamelesse flatterers, then (I thinke) were euer to be found in any Christian Princes Court. <HI>Panormitan</HI> (as is by
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
sundrie learned men alleadged) shameth not to flat∣ter your Pope so farre, as to make him almost equall with God. <HI>Excepto peccato Papa potest quasi omnia fa∣cere quae Deus potest:</HI> Sinne excepted the Pope can in a manner do all things that God can doe: Againe a∣nother clawbacke: <HI>Non minor honor debetur Papae, quam Angelis, &amp;c.</HI> No lesse honour is due to the Pope then to the Angels, for which cause he receiueth of Christian people adorations, prostrating themselues on the ground, and the kissing of his feete, which the Angell would not permit by <HI>Iohn</HI> the Euangelist to be done to him. Another, <HI>Imperatoria Maiestas tantò est inferior Papa, quantò creatura Deo:</HI> The impe∣riall Maiestie is so much inferiour to the Pope, as the creature is to God. Others, that he is <HI>Ens secundae in∣tentionis compositum ex Deo &amp; homine:</HI> And in a word, the Canonists roundly in the Glosse: <HI>Dominus Deus noster Papa</HI>: Our Lord God the Pope. Which blas∣phemous flattering speech <HI>Doctor Raynolds</HI> noteth that the Cardinals, and others deputed by <HI>Gregorie</HI> 13 to reuise, correct, and purge out, such things as by er∣rour had crept into the Glosses, &amp; annotations in the booke of decrees and decretals, &amp;c. yet haue not on∣ly not remoued this blasphemie, but not so much as giuen the least castigation vpon it: belike because they thought that could not fit the Pope, which the Apostle writeth of Antichrist, that he doth sit as God in the Temple of God, shewing himselfe that he is God, vnlesse they should suffer a place to be extant, wherein he is plainely called, <HI>Lord God,</HI> in a popish worke, by the Papists themselues corrected, printed
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
at <HI>Rome,</HI> and that at the Popes own speciall comman∣dement: and so much concerning your accusation of flatterie.</P>
<P>The which yet you labour to enforce, because I take vpon me to speake of infinite blessings from Al∣mightie God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">About the blessings of this land.</NOTE> by her Maiesties gracious gouernment powred vpon this land, and yet my selfe (you say) confesse a thousand feares and frights, and imminent perils which hang ouer vs in these words. <HI>I doubt not but you are men of wisedome, and can easily conceiue what dangers we stand in, by that which hath beene said before.</HI> And againe, <HI>The life of Religion, Queene, and Countrie is at the stake.</HI></P>
<P>Verely if I should speake of the great blessings be∣stowed vpon this land in the happie establishing of true Christian Religion amongs vs, and should think the contrarie, I should iudge my selfe worthie to be taxed with so odious a crime as flatterie is. For I will say as he in the Poet:
<Q><L>Odi etenim ceu claustra Erebi, quicun{que} loquuntur,</L>
<L>Ore aliud, tacito{que} aliud sub pectore claudunt:</L>
<L>I hate as gates of hell, who euer thou art</L>
<L>That one thing say'st, another think'st in hart.</L></Q></P>
<P>But (good Sir) what contrarietie is there in my words?<NOTE PLACE="marg">No contrarie∣tie betwixt our present daun∣gers and our former bles∣sings.</NOTE> May not a land be truly blessed from God, in hauing a gracious Prince, by whom Idolatrie is remoued, and true Religion planted: and yet (for want of due acknowledgement of the Lords good∣nes, and true fruits of thankfulnes) be by forraine e∣nemies maligned, or by home-traitors hazarded?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 49.</NOTE> The remembrance of <HI>Iosiah</HI> (saith <HI>Iesus Syrach</HI>) is like the composition of perfume, that is made by the Art

<P>There remaineth now onely the fourth and last charge against me in this <HI>Encounter</HI> briefely to be dis∣charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">About Par∣dons and In∣dulgences.</NOTE> namely, that I lay to your charge (vn∣truly as you say) that yee prescribe a meanes of deliuerie from all daungers (euen when men sin∣ned immediately against God) which is a pardon from the Popes holines, and absolution from his ho∣ly Priestes. In which accusation what say I more then all the world knoweth to be true? Is it not strange that these men either so vnconscionably pra∣ctise that openly, and generally, which they dare not auow, and iustifie? or so impudently denie, that, which they doe so commonly practise the Catho∣like doctrine is (saith this Champion) that the Popes and Churches Indulgences auaile not to remooue mortall sinnes, &amp;c. neither doth the pardon remit the
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>
guilt of sinne, &amp;c. But (Sir) whatsoeuer your do∣ctrine is in this point, your practise is quite contra∣rie; neither is it any rare thing with your almightie Pope, to practise that generally by his infinite autho∣ritie, which all his Doctors and schoole-men are a∣shamed to defend.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indulgences grounded nei∣ther vpon Scripture, nor vpon ancient Fathers.</NOTE> For as for the authoritie wherup∣on your indulgences are grounded, your owne men confesse, as namely (amongst the rest) <HI>Durandus, De Indulgentijs pauca dici possunt per certitudinem, quia nec scriptura expressè de ijs loquitur, sancti etiā patres Am∣brosius, Hilarins, Hieronymus, Augustinus minime loquun∣tur de indulgentijs:</HI> Little can be certainly affirmed of indulgences, because neither the Scripture speaketh expressely of them, and the ancient fathers, <HI>Ambrose, Hilarie, Ierome, Augustine</HI> make no mention of them.

Notwithstanding whatsoeuer eyther your Doctors pressed with truth doe write, or your Councels for shame are forced to decree, the Pope hath forced for no shame to make marts and mar∣chandise of mens soules by his pardons, and to sell sinne for money, as flesh is sold in the shambles.

Certaine it is that her Maiestie when she was in that trouble and daunger, vsed these words when shee protested her innocencie at her landing at the Tower. <HI>Before thee O God I speake it, hauing none other friends but thee alone:</HI> and as certaine it is that neither wise States-man, nor any other can definitelie say of these, or any other supposed causes, in these respects, or for these causes chiefly shee was preserued: what though shee were gracious, amiable, and vertuous, and much fauoured of the Spanish King (who in policie it may be did by that meanes seeke to win the peoples hearts vnto him,) must it needs follow hereupon, that therefore her innocent behauiour could not bee called into question, nor her bloud shed by any wicked conspi∣racie? The King of Spaine was farre from her in her greatest trouble, and neither you, nor any other can say that hee pleaded her cause or stoode openly for her freedome at any time. If hee sent the Duke of Feria to visite her, or secretly did speake for her to Queene <HI>Marie,</HI> as Master <HI>Foxe</HI> seemeth to confesse,
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>
he did that which was seemely and honorable in a King, and that which her place and innocencie iust∣ly deserued.</P>
<P>As for the generall hope which you say most men had of her Maiesties being a Catholike: if it had been either so vniuersally conceiued as you imagine, or by such outward tokens had appeared as you haue set downe, how can it be true that she was presumed by many to be inclined to a different Religion from yours, as you a little before in this <HI>Encounter</HI> doe con∣fesse? If shee had been deuoted so earnestly to Po∣pish Religion, why needed commaundement to be giuen that shee should haue Masse within her house, within two daies after her committing to the Tow∣er? and how happened it, that her men were so vnskilfull to helpe the Priest, that the first day there could be no Masse for want of a Clerke, and the next day one of her yeomen at <HI>Kyrieleson</HI> made a stop, and set the Priest being not able, or not willing to pro∣ceede any further? Her sound affection to true Re∣ligion was the cause of all her trouble and danger in her Sisters daies, and her willing and ioyfull embra∣cing of the true Christian faith, and of God his true worship and seruice, hath so sufficiently been witnes∣sed euer since the beginning of her Raigne, that no man of common sense or Christian charitie hath the least cause to suspect that her heart should bee vn∣sound in the present profession of God his true Reli∣gion and Gospell.</P>
<P>The last cause which you alleage to concurre to the preseruation of her Maiestie, is but a thing ima∣gined by you seeing the matter of depriuing her Ma∣iestie
<PB N="86" REF="47"/>
of life neuer came to any such stately consulta∣tion as you your selfe in handling this point, doe plainelie graunt; and seeing also that in such a case they could haue found out other meanes, for pre∣uenting such a potent pretender: whatsoeuer you say of the Spaniards affection to the Queene of <HI>Scots</HI> at that time, I am sure all <HI>England</HI> had like to haue ta∣sted by so lamentable an experience, that this Lady of <HI>Scotland</HI> was so affected by <HI>Spaine,</HI> and sundrie of our English Espagniolized traitours, as (if through Gods goodnes shee had not been cut-off in time) hardly could our Soueraigne haue escaped with life long, being almost daily in daunger (whilest that <HI>Scottish</HI> Queene liued) through the practise of <HI>Rome, Spaine,</HI> and our home Traytors. Thus notwithstan∣ding all your flourishes and deuises, your potent cau∣ses are too weake to weaken my speech, the gracious worke of God in preseruing her Maiestie at that time appearing to euery Christian and indifferent iudgement, no lesse miraculous and strange, then I haue affirmed. God is the onely proper maker of mi∣racles, I onely acknowledge his worke in deliuering this my Soueraigne from daunger with thankfulnes, without either flatterie of any person, or ambitions seeking after honour, though you very maliciously and scornefullie do charge me with both; but by that time that veine of your carriage in this your rayling Pamphlet be throughly scanned and conceiued, nei∣ther your tongue nor pen will proue any great slaun∣der. I will shut vp this point with a speech of Master <HI>Iohn Hales</HI> vsed in his oration to her Maiestie at her first entrance to her raigne, which seemeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="87" REF="47"/>
fying of my sayings, his words are these. <HI>He that sit∣teth on high and laugheth at their madnes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Hales Ora∣tion.</NOTE> <HI>would not suf∣fer that the malicious purposes, and most cruell deuised In∣iustice should haue successe. He did take vpon him the pro∣tection of you, he onely hath been your Iehosheba, that preser∣ued you from this wicked Athalia: he onely was the Iehoia∣da that destroyed this cruell Athalia: he onely hath made you Queene of this realme in stead this mischieuous Ma∣rana: No earthly creature can claime any peece of thanks therefore, no mans face, no mans counsaile, no mans aide hath been the cause thereof.</HI></P>
<P>The second thing you finde fault with in this your <HI>Encounter</HI> is my affirming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fretting of the Papists against her Maiestie now being Queene</NOTE> that when our Soueraigne was fullie possessed of her royall seat, then Sathan began to rage, and his ministers to fret and chafe; these my words you terme to be wicked calumniati∣ons, and tales of a tubbe, to entertaine fooles and ignorant people; but with how little truth and ho∣nestie, and with what abundance of malice and folly, that which followeth shall I doubt not make appa∣rant to the indifferent reader.</P>
<P>You aske how it could be that the Papists did freat and chafe, seeing they as the greatest number, and chiefest persons did freelie, and willingly place her, crowne her, annoint her, take her oath, for preser∣uing the lawes of the Realme, and sweare fidelitie to her againe. To which question I returne the like for answere: how could it be that <HI>Haman</HI> commaun∣ded to honour <HI>Mardocheus</HI> in the sight of the people, should fret and chafe at his aduancement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hester. 6.</NOTE> when as he was the man that arrayed <HI>Mardocheus</HI> with roy∣all apparrell, brought him on horsebacke through the
<PB N="88" REF="48"/>
streete, and proclaimed before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the King will honour. This is no tale of a tubbe, as this carping companion would perswade, but a truth out of Gods booke, whereby we may see that some do yeeld vnto that outwardlie in shew, which in their hearts they yeeld not vnto, and at which, afterwards they fret &amp; chafe. And could it otherwise be, but that they must fret and chafe, when as before her raigne in her sisters time one <HI>Ferrar</HI> that was defended by <HI>Storie</HI> and <HI>Bonner,</HI> said that he hoped that she and they that ho∣ped she should haue the Crowne should hop head∣lesse, or be fired with faggots before she should come to the Crowne: and also after her aduancement to the Crowne, the Bishops, and Clergie maisters as they shewed themselues in the conference at <HI>West∣minster,</HI> and in the Parliament assembled verie diso∣bedient, stubborne and malicious, (wherupon some of them were committed to prison,) so they had a consultation to haue excommunicated her, as your worshipfull Cardinall <HI>Allen</HI> affirmeth in his 52. page of his answere to English Iustice, and (as your <HI>Rishton</HI> saith) the Archbishop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> whose dutie it was to haue crowned her, Cardinall <HI>Poole</HI> being dead, refu∣sed to doe it, and so did all the Bishops, except one, and he almost the lowest.</P>
<P>But I will proceed to peruse the examination of some particulars, of the hostilitie by me alleadged, willing the Reader by the way to consider deeply of your graue aduise, which (vpon my vsing the words <HI>Sacred</HI> and <HI>Annoynted,</HI> as honourable and rightly ap∣pertaining to her Maiestie) you offer to be aduised∣ly
<PB N="89" REF="48"/>
thought of, as tending to the commendation of annointing Priestes and Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">About an∣nointing.</NOTE> and concluding stronglie the great honour that her Maiestie had by Catholikes at her first entrance. What, must it needs follow that annointed must be taken for annointing with oile, or must her Maiestie needs be beholding to the Clergie for that she is called the Lords annoin∣ted? I had well hoped that your quoting in the mar∣gent diuers places of Scripture, for confirmation of the ceremony of annointing Priests and Princes, had been a better Bible-clerke then so foulie to be mista∣ken in the 105. Psalme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 150.</NOTE> which place hath been allead∣ged for Priuiledge of the Popish Clergie from the sword of Iustice, notwithstanding their filthie life. The Patriarches, <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI> are cal∣led annointed, and yet were neuer annointed with oile. In <HI>Esay.</HI> 45. <HI>Cyrus</HI> is called the Lords annointed, and yet a heathen Prince:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 2.</NOTE> our Sauiour Iesus is cal∣led annointed, and yet it is not read, that euer he was annointed with outward oile. Princes are cal∣led the Lords annointed chieflie because God hath put them apart, and consecrated them to serue him in place of gouernment, because they are indued with wisedome, courage, strength, and feare of the Lord, and because they should be profitable to the people, gentle, and mercifull, the truth is more respected then the outward ceremonie in the word annointed. Priestes, Kings, and Prophets before Christes time were annointed with visible oile. I confesse, not for such cause as you imagine that Princes are, but to shew that they were appoynted of God, consecrated, and furnished with gifts from him, as
<PB N="90" REF="49"/>
also to be types and figures of Christ, who vnder the law was represented by these three offices, estates, or orders of men. The ceremonie is not now of neces∣sitie to continue; Christ without outward annoin∣ting was called by <HI>Simeon</HI> the annointed of the Lord. So that hir Maiestie may be tearmed honorablie and deseruedlie the Lords annointed, and yet neither your superstitious, and Iewish ceremony of greazing your popish Priests commended thereby, nor her Maiestie made much beholding to your Clergie for that honour.</P>
<P>The first particular of hostilities which you take vpon you to disprooue is my speech of your dar∣ling Doctor <HI>Storie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">About D. Sto∣rie.</NOTE> whom because I call a bloudsuc∣ker, as <HI>Dauid</HI> calleth his persecutors <HI>Saul, Doeg,</HI> and others, bloudie men, you charge me to be light-wit∣ted, and foule mouthed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 5. &amp; 59.</NOTE> you may take your pleasure (Sir <HI>N.D.</HI>) at me stil, as you haue done, but you know the reward of such as contemptuouslie reproach o∣thers with follie, or maliciouslie doe raile and speake euil of them vndeseruedly. You tell vs there are three things in my speech of <HI>Doctor Story</HI> to be considered; the words I charge him with, my interpretation of them, and the iudgement he receiued; in all which if you can either conuince me of vntruth, or iustlie condemn me for vncharitably censuring the speech, and his person, we will beleeue you another time, in your proud boasting. The words (you say) were ne∣uer sufficiently proued to haue been spoken by him, neither by sufficient witnesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stories words.</NOTE> nor by his owne con∣fession: and because the words could not serue to a∣ny purpose, but to his owne ruine (he being known
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>
to be wise and no foole,) you would haue it belee∣ued that he spake them not at all. This is but a simple defence (Sir <HI>Encounterer</HI>) of your stout champion, seeing the words were spoken in the hearing of so many witnesses, both of your side and ours, in the Parliament house, and seeing that the speech being generally testified by them that heard him at that time, it was neuer, either by himselfe denied, or by others that were present controlled. If Doctor <HI>Storie</HI> had been so wise, as you would perswade he was, he would neuer haue vsed such impudent words, such shamelesse talke, such vnconscionable and cruell speeches, without anie pittie, of such as he had per∣secuted most cruellie, as it is certainelie reported he did also at that time. As for the interpretation which you call a bloudie commentarie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The interpre∣tatiō of them.</NOTE> it was not deuised to draw bloud, nor to presse him downe, see∣ing he long since receiued his iust iudgement, it doth onely descrie his bloudie and disloyall heart, which caused his tongue to vtter such furious and bloudie speeches. You would faine haue Doctor <HI>Storie</HI> not to meane the Queene by the roote, but either here∣sie it selfe, or the infected Nobilitie and Gentrie. But alas (Sir <HI>N.D.</HI>) your fained glosses are so farre from drawing his words to another sense, that they rather confirme the same, much like to <HI>Pilates</HI> superscrip∣tion, which being set vp to shew the cause of Christs condemnation, did yet notwithstanding proclaime his innocencie, and conuince them of crueltie: for doe not you a little before confesse, that these words could serue to no other purpose, but to his owne ruine? and doe not you here acknowledge that the
<PB N="92" REF="50"/>
Nobilitie and Gentrie seasoned with true Religion (which you in the madnes of your idle braine call heresie) were but inferiour roots, both which things doe proue, that his words (which were these) <HI>They</HI> (meaning the Commssioners, and Counsellors in Queene <HI>Maries</HI> time) <HI>laboured onely about the young and little sprigs and twigs while they should haue stricken at the roote, and cleane haue rooted it out</HI>) cannot be meant of any other, but of the Prince and chiefe roote, from whom by the great goodnes of God, the gene∣rall and open profession of Christian Religion, hath againe sprung vp in this our land, and with whom it doth continue yet still, notwithstanding that <HI>Bacon, Cicill, Knowles</HI> and all those that you named are dead and gone. The words must needs aime at a person, and not an heresie; at one, and not at many; at a chiefe, and not at anie inferiour; howsoeuer this glosing and cunning <HI>Encounterer</HI> would perswade vs of our Queenes affection to Poperie, or denie that true Re∣ligion was willinglie and ioyfullie without compul∣sion and constraint from others established and maintained by her. <HI>Rishton</HI> one of your Masters, speaking of her before she was crowned, saith, <HI>Ani∣mum in eare suum statim patefecit, &amp;c.</HI> 1. she presentlie shewed her mind in Religion, both by silencing Ca∣tholike preachers (as he calleth them) as also by suf∣fering all those that had liued in exile for Religion, to returne home: and by charging a certaine Bishop readie to celebrate before her, that he should not ele∣uate the consecrate host. For which respects (as he confesseth) the Archbishop of <HI>Yorke</HI> and the rest re∣fused to crowne her,</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="50"/>The iudgement which Doctor <HI>Storie</HI> receiued by the Iustice of our land, was most iust, not being iudged to death for these words (as you craftily, yet verie foolishlie, and falsely haue set downe) but for that he denied her Maiesties Supremacie in the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stories iudge∣ment.</NOTE> and Soueraigntie ouer him, and pleaded himselfe to be no subiect to the Queene, but to the king of <HI>Spaine:</HI> And this is it that your Martyr-maker Doctor <HI>Saun∣ders</HI> seemeth to insinuate in his title added to Doctor <HI>Storie,</HI> shewing that he suffered for the Primacie of your Bishop of <HI>Rome:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Martyrium Io∣an. Stor. Angl. pro ecc. Rom. primat.</HI></NOTE> but obserue the blasphemie of this Pope-holy <HI>Encounterer</HI> against Christ, and his heinous accusation out of a trecherous heart against the Magistrates, and Iustice of our land, in compa∣ring such a traitour as <HI>Storie</HI> was, with our Sauiour Christ, and our Iudges with <HI>Pilate.</HI> Leaue your blind zeale (Sir Romanist) which carrieth you so violent∣ly to such impieties, and begin at length to imbrace true Religion with vs, in the feare of God, and in all loyaltie, and dutie, reuerence and commend the true Iustice of your Countrie.</P>
<P>Whatsoeuer your Catholikes doe imagine <HI>Storie</HI> to be worthie of, hauing made him a Martyr, who indeed was a traitour, howsoeuer your selfe blinded with partiality &amp; heresy cannot find out any trespasse of moment committed by him, (though he denied our Prince to be his Soueraigne and Queene) yet to euerie Christian and in different reader his iudge∣ment will appeare to be iust, and his offence no lesse then treason. Doctor <HI>Saunders</HI> indeed hath made him a Martyr in his booke of the visible Monarchie of the Church, and it may be you haue a purpose to cano∣nize
<PB N="94" REF="51"/>
him for a Saint, if there might be found a <HI>Suriu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that by his Legions or Legend of lies would faine vn∣to him a better life, &amp; some strange miracles; but it be∣ing true that the cause, &amp; not y<SUP>e</SUP> punishmēt doth make a Martyr, and that some things had in great estimatiō with mē, may be abominable in Gods sight, your trai∣terous <HI>Story</HI> shal be no better a Martir, then the Martirs of <HI>Montanus, Marcion, Nouatus</HI> heresies of whom <HI>Euse∣bius</HI> maketh mentiō. And so leauing your traiterous Doctor: let vs come to y<SUP>e</SUP> second hostilitie, wherwith you find fault, &amp; that is the Bull of <HI>Pius Quintus</HI> with the excommunication of her Maiestie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bull of Pius Quintus.</NOTE> concerning which Bul, it moueth your patiēce greatly, that euery where in schooles, sermons, books &amp; places of Iustice, this fact of your Pope should be produced, as a sound witnes and testimony, of the vnsound and disloyall hearts of such of your catholikes, as approue your Popes dealing therein, by which you would enforce that matter wanted wherwith to charge your traitors; at their arraignment for there was alwaies many and sufficient proofes, wee need not seeke farre for matter to conuict you of most grosse impieties, and cursed practises, you haue herein yeelded vs too great an haruest to labour in, and our hearts desire hath euer been that we might trulie speak better things of you: We charge none to be guiltie of y<SUP>e</SUP> fact, but such as ap∣proue it, or shew thēselues too forward to yeeld obe∣diēce vnto it: &amp; yet (sir <HI>N.D.</HI>) I think you could hard∣ly resolue this doubt, how a papist acknowledging your Popes authoritie, and iustifying his proceeding therein, may acknowledge her Maiestie to be his true and rightful Queene. For in the title to that Bul, you
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>
know the Queene is called a pretended Queene, by the Bull she is deposed, her Subiects are absolued frō their oath of fealtie &amp; allegeance, and those that obay her are accursed. What though all Catholiks are not priuie to your Popes reasons, &amp; informations? may it not be concluded necessarily (notwithstāding that) that such as acknowledge the Popes supreme autho∣ritie ouer Prices, and hold it for a <HI>maxime,</HI> that in a definitiue sentence he cannot erre, are enemies to Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> &amp; the State? I know in deed some, as Master <HI>Hart,</HI> may deny that y<SUP>e</SUP> Pope hath any thing to doe with disposing of kingdomes, &amp; deposing of Princes, and so the Bull may not any waie concerne them; but I doubt there be but a few that will affirme the Popes supremacy in tēporal things to be vsurped. But because you post ouer this matter to other treati∣ses, esteeming of me in matter of dispute, as <HI>Goliah</HI> did of <HI>Dauid</HI> whō he scorned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Master Iuel. Bullenger.</NOTE> I wil also referre the Chri∣stiā reader to such learned treatises as are extāt for this <HI>Pandora</HI> her box, &amp; descrying the hurtful and vnhol∣some euils that lye in the bowels of y<SUP>e</SUP> seditious Bull.</P>
<P>And because in this place (before you consider fur∣ther of this Bull) you take exceptions against a propo∣sition of mine which you terme ridiculous, &amp; to pro∣ceede from deepe ignorance and a base breast, I will a little fortifie my saying, and make it apparant to the indifferent reader, either your grosse mistaking, or wilfull and malicious peruerting of my said speech: as for your <HI>Lucyfer</HI>-like pride it is more then apparant alreadie: my words are these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether any man may de∣pose Kings.</NOTE> <HI>As though it were in the power of any one mortall childe of man, to dispose of King∣domes, to depose Princes, or to dispense with subiects for not,
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>
onely disobeying, but rebelling against their lawfull Soue∣raignes, &amp;c.</HI> Is this such a ridiculous proposition (Sir <HI>Encounterer</HI>) or doe these words either make tempo∣rall Kingdomes matters of Godhead and immorta∣litie, or necessarily conclude that wicked Princes, such as <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Caligula,</HI> must bee obeyed in all things, with which flourishes, and false gloses you seeke to discredite my sayings? Your malice did ma∣ster your reason, and your will did ouerrun your wit in this your lewde construction.</P>
<P>That which I said I may lawfullie still vphold, that Princes are not depriuable by any mortall man, nei∣ther can any man dispense with subiects for refusing to yeeld that obedience which the Lorde requireth them to yeeld. The Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> acknowledgeth that it is God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 2. and 4.</NOTE> that hath this power to take away Kings, and to set vp Kings, and to giue the kingdome to whom hee will, and saieth that the Lord ordereth the States and Princes of the world at his pleasure: <HI>Marie</HI> the blessed Virgine reserueth this honor who∣lie to God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 1.</NOTE> <HI>He putteth down the mightie from their seate, and exalteth the base:</HI> reade ouer the bookes of Kings, none euer disposed of kingdomes, but the Lorde of Lordes; neither were any throwne from their thrones, but by the Lords speciall appointment, as in the deiection of <HI>Ieroboam, Baasa, Elah, Achab</HI> and <HI>Io∣ram</HI> is apparant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 14.</NOTE> There was neuer any King of <HI>Israel</HI> or <HI>Iudah</HI> remoued from the Crowne, by any Priest or Prophet, though all the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> were open Idolaters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 19.</NOTE> as also the most part of the Kings of <HI>Iudah,</HI> euen fourteene of them.</P>
<P>But it may be you thinke, because the Prophets
<PB N="97" REF="52"/>
denounced Gods iudgements, annointed some to be Kings, and some others by speciall commandement and authority did execute Gods iudgements, as <HI>Iehu</HI> vpon <HI>Ioram</HI> and <HI>Achabs</HI> children, that therefore my proposition is infringed; which cannot be (Sir <HI>En∣counterer</HI>) for it was done by Gods speciall appoint∣ment, as Iudge and superiour ouer Princes, and not by their owne motions, or in their owne name: No Priest, no Prophet, no Apostle, no Bishop euer had authoritie to depose Princes. Hee that saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 8.</NOTE> <HI>By mee Kings raigne,</HI> doth challenge this power to himselfe, and it is plaine blasphemie to giue it to any other. Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> expressely resolueth that Kings neede not to feare to lose their Kingdomes, or that their Kingdome shall bee taken from them, as wret∣ched <HI>Herod</HI> feared, and therefore out of all question,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August. in Psalm.</HI> 47.</NOTE> there is no such authoritie giuen to any mortall child of man to depose Princes.</P>
<P>But although I thus confidently and vpon good grounde doe pleade against the Popes vsurped au∣thoritie, yet I am neither so seruily sottish, or so super∣stitiouslie conscienced, as either to adore earthlie Princes, or to denie that any Prince established may be touched or disobeyed in any matter: for as I haue learned to giue to <HI>Caesar</HI> that which is <HI>Caesars,</HI> and to God, that which is Gods, worshipping the Lord on∣lie with Religious worship: so I know vsurpers may be suppressed by rightfull inheritance, as <HI>Athalia</HI> by <HI>Iehoiada,</HI> and in our land <HI>Richard</HI> the third, by <HI>Henrie</HI> the seuenth: and to our Princes wee must yeeld such obedience as the Lorde alloweth, obeying them in the Lord, chusing rather with the Disciples to obey
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>
God then man, when man commaundeth wic∣ked and vnlawfull things. And so leauing you (Sir Pope-Idolater) to your palpable flatterie, and to please and defend your <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Caligula,</HI> as a more fit fellow to flatter seriouslie, and to adore such saints then my selfe, I stand as becommeth me in loyaltie for my Christian, and religious Soueraigne, and so will doe (by Gods grace) whilest I liue to my last breath.</P>
<P>Your three points which you would haue to bee considered vpon my speech of the Bull come next to be handled, by which you would gladlie proue, that not the malignitie of the Pope and Papists against our Prince brought forth this roring Bull, but some dealings of ours, and that the Popish Recusants are not to be accused for it, or inforced by meanes there∣of to change their olde beleefe about the Popes au∣thoritie.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1</NOTE>The first point to be considered, is that the Bull of <HI>Pius Quintus</HI> cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rth in the thirteenth yeare of her Maiesties raigne and not before, as by our owne Chronicles (you say) appeareth: Let it bee so (Sir <HI>N.D.</HI>) though the Bull was set vp in the thirteenth yeare of her Raigne, and dated 1567. 5. <HI>Calend. Martij,</HI> what conclude you hereupon? Must it therefore needes follow that the Bull proceeded not from any malignitie of the Pope, and Papists? but of some o∣ther cause, as out of mine owne words you would seeme to proue. Your argument is verie weake, your conclusion cannot bee inforced vpon such slender premisses. The malignitie of the Papists is most ap∣parant by their consulting to excommunicate her
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>
Maiestie, as before I shewed out of Cardinall <HI>Allyn,</HI> by Doctor <HI>Stories</HI> words, by informations giuen a∣gainst her, which you confesse, whereupon the Pope in his Bull chargeth her with many things most vn∣truely and falselie. The hatred of the Pope is most euident, calling her a pretended Queene and an vsur∣per, euen in the title, and beginning of the Bull. And though the Bull was not published till the 12. yeare, being yet concluded vpon about two yeares before, as the date sheweth, yet both the Pope and his adhe∣rents might as well fret and storme at her enioying of the Crowne, as at her Christian and Religious gouernment. Buls are not hastelie procured, your Pope must be sued vnto, and false informations must be giuen, and it might be as they had vaine hopes for a time to feede themselues with, so (those hopes fay∣ling) the fittest season for publishing of the Bull, was thought to be when others were prepared to raise re∣bellion.</P>
<P>The second point is a matter of as deepe conside∣ration<NOTE PLACE="marg">2</NOTE> as the former, wherein hee telleth vs by enu∣meration of diuers hard vsages offered by her Maie∣stie and the Protestants, against the Pope and Popish Catholicks, that it must needs be, that not malignitie of the Pope and his adherents against her, but diuers iniuries and cruelties offered, inforced the publicati∣on of the Bull. I will not vouchsafe to make an Apo∣logie for defence of those things, which you (Sir <HI>En∣counterer</HI>) recken vp as wrongs and iniuries offered to your Pope and Pope-worshippers; this onely I say for answere, that as her Maiestie hath done nothing in the reformation of Religion, in requiring an oath

of her people for acknowledgement of her authori∣tie, in inforcing her Subiects to the true seruice of God, in punishing offenders, and obstinate persons, and such like proceedings, but that which God com∣maunded her, and the godlie zealous Princes haue done before her: so it doth not necessarilie follow, that notwithstanding all those things haue been done in godlie zeale and louing care for the saluati∣on of the soules of her people, therefore you are free from malignitie, your faultines wherein I haue eui∣dentlie proued before, though in your deepe and cunning flatterie you would gladlie denie it: you fawne vpon her Maiestie, and yet accuse her most falselie of breach of promise in altering Religion: you seeme to free her from a desire to publish Gods Gospell, and yet affirme that your Pope had great cause to proceede against her. Other Princes as <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the first, <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Henrie</HI> the fourth, haue made lawes against the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> his au∣thoritie and vsurped iurisdiction, and yet haue not tasted so much of his malice, which sheweth the malignitie of your Pope and his adherents against her Maiestie. As for your Poperie and superstition rooted out of this land, it was not of so long conti∣nuance as you boast, for but little before <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, Kings were Gods Vicars for gouer∣ning his Church, Ecclesiasticall liuings were be∣stowed by the Princes, they made Ecclesiasticall lawes, Priests were married, and your Transubstan∣tiation was not then knowne: You blasphemouslie scoffe at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and ye glorie in the dissention betweene vs and the <HI>Luthe∣rans,</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>
but as the Lord is of will and power to mocke mockers, so can hee make the infirmitie of his ser∣uants, worke to his glorie and their good. I passe ouer many things willinglie in this your Rhetoricall flou∣rishing, contenting my selfe to haue shewed the <HI>non sequitur</HI> of your allegation.</P>
<P>The third point which you would haue conside∣red, is that it was an acte of iurisdiction from an Ec∣clesiasticall superiour, as also an auncient kinde of proceeding against Princes in our land, as well as in other places without any trouble to the people for the same, and therefore you would not haue your Catholikes to be charged with it, or troubled for it. For answere thereunto this I affirme, that as wee ac∣knowledge not your Popes superioritie, or Ecclesia∣sticall iurisdiction ouer vs, he playing the vsurping Tirant, in censuring our Prince; so we neither yeelde that this his proude and malicious cursing and ex∣communication of Princes hath been of long con∣tinuance; or that those his adherents, who iustifie his proceedings are to bee freed from blame. We ac∣knowledge that Princes the annointed of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.</NOTE> are the higher powers ordained to execute Iustice, and Iudgement ouer the good and euill: We knowe no other Superiour in nations and kingdomes, next and immediatelie vnder God, but such as the Apo∣stle <HI>Peter</HI> willeth vs to be subiect vnto, when he saith, <HI>Submit your selues vnto all manner ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be vnto the King, as to the Su∣periour, &amp;c.</HI> he speaketh of one not of many superi∣ours, where a Monarchie is established.</P>
<P>The time was when your Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> was far
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>
from hauing a superioritie euen in <HI>Rome</HI> and his do∣minions; for both <HI>Charles</HI> the great, and <HI>Otho</HI> the great, had right soueraigntie, and royaltie of the Countries giuen to your Popes, with acknowledge∣ment to bee their Soueraigne Lordes, in regarde of which they yeelded tributes, and other seruices vnto them: as also in former times, the Emperours had their Lieutenants and deputies in <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Valentinian Theodosius.</HI></NOTE> euen to <HI>Gregorie</HI> the seuenths time; and your Popes obtained not the Soueraigntie which now they challenge, till it was almost 1200. yeares after Christ, in the daies of <HI>Alexander</HI> the third, and <HI>Innocentius</HI> the third, both Bishops of <HI>Rome.</HI> Your vsuall engine of ex∣communication, and depriuing of Princes of their Crownes, is likewise far short of that antiquitie, by which you would seeme to mitigate the rigour and crueltie thereof. For as there was neuer any <HI>Romane</HI> King or Emperor excommunicated and depriued of his kingdom by any Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> before <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> who was excommunica∣ted &amp; cursed by <HI>Gregory</HI> the seuenth, the brand of hel, who being a Necromancer, a periured person, and a most wicked man, confessed at his death to a Cardi∣nall that he was set on by the Diuell to raise vp dis∣cord, and warres in Christendome: so in <HI>England</HI> from the conquest vnto King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight, there was no Prince of this land deposed by your pope, but onely King <HI>Iohn.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sigebert. in Anno</HI> 1088.</NOTE> It is a noueltie (Sir <HI>N.D.</HI>) and not a matter of antiquitie (as <HI>Sigebert</HI> telleth you,) to teach that people owe no subiection to euill kings, &amp;c. As for that you say that Subiects heretofore in our land haue not beene troubled, or forced to al∣ter
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>
their beliefe concerning the Popes power, not∣withstanding his cursing and depriuing of Princes is more then you know, and it maketh no great matter whether it were so or no, seeing that your vse of ex∣communication hath not been so frequent in our land, and your dealings were neuer so treacherous and desperate as they haue been of late. Our English Nation did neuer at any time since the first recei∣uing of the faith vnto this day, acknowledge the v∣surped power of your Pope to depose Princes, much lesse hath it been anie matter of our faith: your Pope <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and <HI>Boniface</HI> the eight, may put in tran∣substantiation to be an Article of our beliefe, and make your popes supremacie of the necessitie of sal∣uation; but wee haue learned to ground our faith vpon the Scriptures of God, which teacheth no such absurd and diuellish points. The lawes of our land haue heretofore in King <HI>Richard</HI> the seconds time, and <HI>Edward</HI> the thirds time, made it treason to bring in any excommunication from <HI>Rome,</HI> to im∣pugne the lawes of the Realme for benefices and pa∣tronages, to compasse or imagine the death of the King, to leuie warre against the Prince, or to be ad∣herent and fauourers of the Kings enemies, all which lawes doe verie neerly concerne such amongst you, as vouch the Popes wicked claime to depose Prin∣ces, and are perswaders, aiders, and comforters of in∣uasion and rebellion: Your affections wee deale not with, but with your confessions, wee punish you not, for your faith, but for your works.</P>

vpon anie Recusant for his recusancie, but either im∣prisonment, or amercement? If your aduentures had not been most audacious, and your attempts most dangerous, being as men perplexed and enraged to see her Maiestie liue, and gouerne in so long happi∣nes, you might haue been stil vsed with as much mer∣cie and clemencie, as it is possible for a Christian Prince to offer to vnrulie, and vndutifull subiects<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Princes for their safetie, and repressing of rebellions, may temper their lawes with seuerity, and make that treason which to some seemeth a matter of Reli∣gion; as wee see in <HI>Augustines</HI> time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. contrali∣terai Petil. lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ca. 92.</HI></NOTE> it was treason to say that Emperours perished for persecuting, which yet <HI>Petilian</HI> and his companie thought they might say trulie and zealously.</P>

<P>The third and last hostilitie, against which in this <HI>Encounter</HI> you take exception,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Traterous practises of some Papists.</NOTE> is the rebellion and traiterous practises of diuers of your Catholikes a∣gainst our gracious Soueraigne, where with I charge them, which though you labour with all your skill and cunning to excuse, will appeare to be no lesse im∣pious, and hainons in them, nor lesse daungerous to Prince and Countrie, then I haue affirmed.

Are not these open hostilities, and open and actuall proofes that there is in you a resolution to doe anie thing that you can, for the ouerthrow of the present State, vnder which (through Gods mercie) we happily and bles∣sedlie liue? That we had but one commotion in this Realme we may thanke our good God, and not you and your Catholikes, who haue done your best by procuring inuasion from abroad, and ripening rebel∣lion at home, to multiplie that one to many; but that the mightie hand of God did alwaies disioynt your deuises, praised be his name for it.</P>

It is no new thing with you and your adherents by outcries, tragicall exclamations, and most slaunderous vntruthes, to seeke to blemish her Maiesties milde gouernment, and the iust exe∣cution of Iustice amongest vs: there is a God that knoweth all, and will iudge betweene vs; how light a matter soeuer you take it to be, to rayle vpon his annointed, and to vilifie and reuile the reuerent Iudges and wholesome lawes of the land, by the odious names of Atheists and bloudie lawes.</P>
<P>The third colour wherewith you would dasell our eies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A vaine co∣lour.</NOTE> in beholding your traiterous practises, is no lesse vaine and foolish, then the other two before are slan∣derous, and false: for what though it be incident to all Common-wealthes to be troubled with commo∣tions, shall it therefore not follow that your rebelli∣ous, and seditious practises moued onely for the maintenance of the Romish primacie, and saith, doe manifest the dangerousnes of your doctrine, and

treacherie of your hearts against the State of Chri∣stian Princes? you cannot defend your selues by so sleight a reason. Those troubles that were in King <HI>Henrie</HI> and King <HI>Edwards</HI> raigne proceeding chiefely not from your onely suffering with groaning (as you say) but from the treacherous disloyall hearts of Pa∣pists, who were the chiefest actors therein, doe con∣uict you of such crimes as I haue charged you with. And euen these rebellions so often attempted in the latter end of King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight, and the raigne of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, doe testifie of your admira∣ble patience and loyaltie. I maruaile with what face you can commend your Catholikes, and compare them with Protestantes for loyaltie, and willing subiection to Princes, when with your owne penne you shew your forwardnes in euerie Princes raigne to rebell, and yet cannot trulie charge vs with any one rebellious practise in the maintenance of true Religion.</P>

as both <HI>Wyat</HI> and the rest were carried by other per∣swasions, then the maintenance of true religion, to deale so rashly and vnsoundly as they did: so there is no reason that some priuate actions, and opinions generally condemned by our doctrine should preiu∣dice all Protestants. You haue great cause to com∣plaine of our rebellions, when you can recken vp, but one poore insurrection, and that vpon other grounds then religion, and such a one as was suppres∣sed without the spoile or hurt of anie of the Queenes side.

As for your commotions and reuels you say haue been made in other countries by those of the Re∣ligion, I leaue both you and them to their Apo∣logies in print, wherein you shall finde, that none of them did holde, that eyther Pope or other might depose Princes, or dispence with Subiectes for their obedience to their lawfull Soueraignes.

But for orders sake to take a short view of them, as they are by him headed out: In this <HI>Encounter</HI> hee bringeth in a yoake of Popish Prelates, Bishop <HI>Gardiner</HI> and Cardinall <HI>Allen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop Gardi∣ner and Car∣dinall Allen compared.</NOTE> whome he supposeth to be greatlie wronged, and in∣iured by mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vpon whom he looking through the spectacles of a partiall and Popish affection, imagi∣neth greater giftes of learning and vertue in them then were in deede, making them a peereles paire of Prelates, and verie sagelie compareth their qualities together, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> doth the most famous worthies of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece:</HI> which his comparison I passe

ouer, as nothing concerning any thing said by me in my former booke against them. Onely I yeelde they were birdes of a feather, and therefore fit to slie to∣gether, and according to our English prouerbe, <HI>like will to like,</HI> (you know what followeth) and in deede milke is not liker milke, nor one egge another, then were these two statelie Prelates, each of them being brides of the Popes owne hatching, and as it is in the Prouerbe, <HI>Mali corui, malum ouum,</HI> and both of them for the Popes sake being false and treacherous a∣gainst their Soueraignes. Cardinall <HI>Allen</HI> against her Maiestie (as hereafter shall bee shewed) Bishop <HI>Gardiner</HI> against her renowmed Father, when he was Ambassadour for the King to the Emperour, hauing secret intelligence with the Pope, then the Kings o∣pen and professed enemie, in so much that the King in euery generall pardon that he graunted by Parlia∣ment after this practise, he did still except all treasons committed beyond the Seas: meaning thereby (as it was supposed) that the Bishop should not take any benefite by any generall pardon, if his Maiestie would at any time call him to account: and further minded (as it seemeth) to haue vsed extremitie of lawe against him, (if the Lord had lent his Highnes longer life) vpon iust matter not taken away by any pardon, commaunding thereupon often the Lorde <HI>Paget</HI> (being then his Secretarie) to keepe safe cer∣tain writings which he had against him. But the pari∣ties, or disparities of your two Prelates by you com∣pared together, I passe ouer as matter impertinent, and come to your exceptions against my speeches vttered of them in particular. And first concerning
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>
Bishop <HI>Gardiner</HI> he setteth downe these my speeches. <HI>Gardiner that most proude and bloodie monster, left no corner of his wit vnsought, to shorten her Maiesties daies, and preuent her by the bloodie slaughter of her sacred per∣son, from being our Queene.</HI> And againe, <HI>The Recusants of our age cannot professe, nor make greater shew of loy∣altie and loue to our dread Soueraigne, neither, &amp;c.</HI></P>

His wife made often sute to the Bi∣shop to be permitted to visite her husband, but his bowels wanted compassion, till at length she meeting him at the Court, was bold to pul him by the Rochet and said to him: <HI>O my Lord these eighteene daies I haue troubled your Lordship, now for the loue of God, and as euer you came of a woman, put me off no longer, but let me goe to my husband:</HI> One of the kings seruants, and her next neighbour standing by, besought him to be good Lord to her; which had her owne mother ly∣ing bedredde vpon her hands, besides fiue or six chil∣dren.

But a taste must be giuen to the Reader, for which this may suffice: when that reue∣rent learned man, (and afterwards a most constant Martyr of Iesus Christ) D. <HI>Rowland Taylor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Tailor</NOTE> a Doctor professed in both the lawes, and withall a right per∣fect diuine, appeared before <HI>Gardiner</HI> vpon his sum∣mons; how vngently did he intreat him? nay how fu∣riously

all post haste from <HI>Oxford,</HI> assuring the Bishop most certainly that he saw fire put to them.

And thereof no doubt (as most like it is) came the thrusting out of his tongue from his mouth, so swolne and blacke with the inflammation of his bodie. A specta∣cle worthie to be noted and beholden of all such bloudie burning persecutors.</P>
<P>But not to stand vpon the deuotion of this your milde Bishop, who would not eate till he were sure of the death of these two worthies (a deuotion matchable with that of the Tyrant <HI>Richard</HI> the third, then but Protector, who sware by Saint <HI>Paule</HI> that he would not dine till the Lord <HI>Hastings</HI> head were off, and would needs stay so long for his oathes sake) nor vpon the great ioy this Bishop conceiued at the certaine report of their deaths, as if the shedding of Christian bloud had been to him as the obteyning of great treasures; nor yet vpon the fearfull iudgement of God, so vpon the present, and on the suddaine inflicted vpon him: I will remember this one thing,
<PB N="124" REF="66"/>
how that the Dutches of <HI>Suffolke</HI> espying him in the Tower, (being the prisoner) inking <HI>Edwards</HI> raigne: said it was merrie with the Lambes, now the Wolfe was shut vp: which speech, this your gentle natured Bishop, and nothing vindicatiue (as you terme him) well remembred in Queene <HI>Maries</HI> time, and ther∣fore in the first lent of her raigne, studied an holie practise of reuenge, first by touching this Dutches in the person of her husband Master <HI>Bertye,</HI> for whom he sent an attachment to the Sherife of <HI>Lin∣colneshire,</HI> with a speciall letter, commaunding him most strictly to attach him, and without Bale to bring him vp to him to <HI>London,</HI> whereas he had no cause at all to send for him. Afterwards examineth him of the Dutches his wiues Religion, whether she was now as readie to set vp the Masse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiners de∣sire of reuenge against the Duches of Suf∣folke.</NOTE> as before to pull it downe, with further obiections to the same purpose: by which Master <HI>Berty</HI> fully perceiued the cruell minde of the Bishop set vpon bloudie reuenge, and therefore obtained leaue of the Queene for his vr∣gent and important affaires to passe the Seas, secret∣ly appointed how the Dutchesse should come after, who with her daughter of a yeere olde, with a fewe of her meanest seruants, in great danger tooke barge at Lion Key, in the mistie morning, chusing rather to commit her selfe to the winde and waues, then to your <HI>Gardiners</HI> gentle, and nothing vindicatiue disposition.</P>
<P>What should I stand vpon any further matter to lay open the nature &amp; disposition of this your milde Prelate? <HI>Boner</HI> who knew him better then you (Sir <HI>Encounterer</HI>) doth more then iustifie me in that large

And this (I hope) is sufficient to cleare me from malignitie, and sycophancie, for calling so vnworthie a man a bloudie monster.</P>
<P>After this flourish to make shew in generall of the Bishops milde mature (whereof by these fewe)<NOTE PLACE="marg">About Gardi∣ners seeking Queene Eli∣zabeths life.</NOTE> particulars the reader may more soundly iudge) this his Proctor proceedeth to cleere him of seeking her Maiesties life in the raigne of her sister: but it see∣meth his conscience gaue him a secret checke, when he set pen to paper about this defence.

to his nature, then to seeke the bloud of so gracious and innocent a Ladie? And seemeth not (trow ye) his case to be verie good which so wood∣die, yea so hot, and fierie a Patrone seekes to main∣taine with so slender and cold a defence, as <HI>I dare say he doth him apparunt and wilfull wrong?</HI> But he ad∣deth, <HI>she was an obiect rather of loue and compassion, then of enuie, and hatred:</HI> But what loue could proceede from him that was of an hard heart, and cancred ma∣licious stomacke? what compassion could he shewe whose verie bowels were cruell? As for the misteri∣ous bracelet of which this brabler talketh, in which all the secrecie of <HI>Wyats</HI> conspiracie was said to lie hidden, which <HI>Gardiner</HI> farther pierced then any o∣ther, but neuer vsed or vrged the knowledge gotten thereof, to the Ladies perill: I answere, that the mi∣sterie of this <HI>Shemeis</HI> treacherie against that innocent Ladie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The misterie of his tale of a misterious bracelet.</NOTE> &amp; his now Soueraigne, may hereby appeare to all men; who to grace his client with the commenda∣tion of a deepe politike, to pearse further into the mi∣sterie of that conspiracie, then anie other, and of a tender harted man, in not vsing nor vrging his know∣ledge gotten thereof to the Ladies perill: layeth the highest disgrace vpon his Soueraigne that can be imagined; as if she had been secretly confederate with <HI>Wyat</HI> in his rebellion against her sister; and that this Eagle-eyed Bishop had spied so much in a miste∣rious bracelet, but of pure good will did neuer vrge it to her perill. Whereas for euer finding any suspiti∣on against her, through so manie hard and earnest sif∣tings, his owne mouth is a witnesse against him, who (kneeling downe to her Grace, after long triall

had of her loyaltie and integritie,) said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiner con∣fesseth the wrong impri∣sonment of Ladie Eliza∣beth.</NOTE> <HI>Then hath your Grace the aduantage of me, and other of the Lords, for your long and wrong Imprisonment.</HI> As for his concealing of any thing that hee might finde a∣gainst her, or desire to free her from daunger: who knoweth not how farre both hee and the rest of the Clergie were from any such inclination?

But was your Bishop more mildlie affected then the Doctor? Nay hee was so vnwilling to haue her cleered, as hee chafed exceedinglie at a poore Apprentise in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> for saying that <HI>Wyat</HI> had cleered her, and the Lord <HI>Courtney,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiner vn∣willing to haue the Ladie Eli∣zabeth clee∣red.</NOTE> and caused the Lord Maior to bring this poore youth to the Starre Chamber, where hee vttered a speech vpon that occasion, and pronounced the innocent Ladie guiltie, and commaunded the Apprentise should be punished. And if Master <HI>Brid∣ges</HI> then Lieutenant of the Tower had not (as is re∣ported) most honestly aduentured to Queene <HI>Marie,</HI> to informe her of a warrant that was out for the exe∣cution of this her worthie Sister, the innocent Ladie had lost her life, poore <HI>England</HI> had been depriued of so gracious a Soueraigne, and the light of our Candlesticke had been put out. But blessed bee the Lorde who gaue not the Soule of his Turtle Doue to the beasts, nor his darling to the power of the dogges.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="68"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bringing in of the Spa∣niard.</NOTE>With this, for good fellowship may walke hand in hand, his plea for the Bishops freedome concerning the bringing in of the <HI>Spaniard</HI>; of which I affirme, that <HI>Gardiner</HI> and his complices neuer rested, vntill they had brought in the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and matched him with Queene <HI>Marie:</HI> by which they betraied God, her, and the whole Realme: from which this Proctor first would cleare him, by imagining in him a partiall affection to the Earle of <HI>Deuonshire,</HI> whom he would haue married to the Queene. But it were strange that in a man of <HI>Gardiners</HI> place, there should bee so great ficklenes and mutabilitie, that in so short a space, so great loue should bee turned into such extreame ha∣tred; a little before in his loue he would haue made him (as you say) as a King, by matching him to Queene <HI>Marie:</HI> within a while after he would haue made him worse then a caitife, and to suffer as a Trai∣tour, accusing him earnestlie in the Starre Chamber, when as <HI>Wyat</HI> had cleered him. Secondlie, hee de∣maundeth if this had been so (as hee saith it was not) why did they betraie therein both God, their Queene and their Countrie? To which his de∣maunde I briefelie answere. God was betraied be∣cause his true Religion was exiled, (which Queene <HI>Marie,</HI> before her obtaining the Crowne, promised to the <HI>Suffolke</HI> men to maintaine,) and in steede there∣of Idolatrie was established. The Queene they be∣traied, because they matched her to an vnhusband-like husband, who estranged both his affection and companie from her, which was thought to be a great cause of the shortning of her daies: for when the cause of her often sighing a little before her death
<PB N="129" REF="68"/>
was asked, of her selfe she confessed this to bee one (though not the onelie) cause, that she could not en∣ioie the companie of her husband. The Realme they betraied, because they sought to make it subiect to a stranger, though yet (blessed bee God) doe all they what they could, or the Queene herselfe, they could neuer set the Crowne of <HI>England</HI> vpon King <HI>Phillips</HI> head: And that the temporall inconueniences by that match were not more fullie felt, God is to bee praised, who gaue him here so short an aboade. Fur∣ther by this match they bringing in the Pope, and re∣signing the Supremacie to him, did wrong to the Crowne: for by the Lawe of God, the King in his owne Realme is chiefe gouernour, both in causes Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill; the Pope contrariwise will not onelie be aboue the King in all causes Ecclesiasti∣call, but also in some Ciuill, challenging all Bishops and Cleargie men for his subiects, exempting them in things Ciuill from the Kings authoritie, whereby he robbeth the King of a great part of his Subiects, and in the Realme doth gleane out another Realme to himselfe: yea challengeth to haue power to de∣pose the Prince. Againe, the auncient Lawes of the Realme were hereby made to stand for cyphers; the Lawes of the Realme will haue a Priest for debt to bee sued before a temporall Iudge, but the Popes Lawe commeth and crieth the contrarie: Patrones by the Lawes of the Realme should giue Benefices; but the Popes Lawe setteth them besides.

But to looke backe a little vpon this famous Sermon, in the long narratiō that you set down by occasion of this Sermon, I must examine some few points, wher∣in either this Proctor belieth the Bishop, or the Bi∣shop the King. And first if it be true that he affirmeth that King <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight appointed <HI>Gardiner</HI> to be one of the sixteene Counsellors in his testament to gouerne his Sonne, and the Realme: how happe∣ned it that Sir <HI>Anthonie Browne</HI> was so earnest and importunate a sutor to the King, to haue <HI>Gardiner</HI> put into his Will againe when he was put out?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiner put out of King Henries Will.</NOTE> And why did the King bid him holde his peace, and trouble him therewith no more? For if hee were in, he would trouble them all; and if hee moued him a∣ny more for <HI>Gardiner,</HI> he would also put him out. Is not this an argument that the King reposed great trust in <HI>Gardiner</HI> for the gouernment of his Sonne and the Realme? Another thing you say <HI>Gardiner</HI> vttered in his Sermon, that King <HI>Henrie</HI> in his latter time was inclined to reconcile himselfe to the Pope. But I would the Bishop had had more wit to speake truth, and lesse skill in lying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">King Henrie the eyght not minded to re∣concile him∣selfe to the Pope as Gar∣diner saith, but quite contra∣rie.</NOTE> for it is apparant that not long before the Kings death, hee with his owne mouth answered the Ambassadour of <HI>Frederick</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> that if the quarrell of the Duke his master were nothing else against the Emperour but for Religion, he should stand to it stronglie, and hee would take his part. Nay more then this (as the wor∣thie Archbishop of <HI>Canterburie</HI> Doctor <HI>Cranmer,</HI> a man farre more inward with the King then <HI>Gardiner</HI> was, doth testifie) the King but little before his death resolued, talking with the Archbishop, and <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="135" REF="71"/>
Embassadour, that he and the King of <HI>France</HI> within one halfe yeere, would not onely change the Masse in both the Realmes to a Communion, as it is now vsed, but vtterly to haue banished the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> &amp; his vsurped authority: Yea they were so throughly and firmely resolued in that behalf, that they minded also to exhort the Emperour, to doe the like in <HI>Flaun∣ders</HI> and other his Countries and Seigniories, or else to breake off from him.</P>
<P>A third thing in this discourse you alleadge, that Bishop <HI>Gardiner</HI> was wont to say of King <HI>Henrie,</HI> that after he left to loue that person which by Gods law, and mans law, he was bound to loue aboue all others (to wit his first wife and Queene) he ne∣uer loued anie person heartilie, and constantlie after.</P>
<P>Whereunto I shortly answere, that concerning his often changes of his wiues putting som to death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">About King Henries di∣uorce from his first wife with Gard. iudge∣ment of it.</NOTE> and others away, I will not take vpon me to answere at all. But to <HI>Gardiners</HI> report I answere, that this his mutabilitie proceeded not hereof, because he ceased to loue the first, but because he first loued where he should not, namely his owne brothers wife, against the voice of God and nature: as crouching and glo∣sing <HI>Gardiner,</HI> who flattered with the issue of this vn∣lawfull match, not in word onely, but in publike writing professed to the whole world, vtterly con∣demning the former mariage, with his brothers wife, and approuing &amp; iustifying the second with Queene <HI>Anne.</HI> In his booke <HI>De vera obedientia,</HI> he writeth of that point to this purpose. And amongst these, <HI>Sith there is commaundement that a man shall not marrie his
<PB N="136" REF="72"/>
brother's wife, what could the King: excellent Maiestie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> otherwise then he did? by the consent of the people and iudgement of his Church, that is, be diuorced from vn∣lawfull marriage, and vse lawfull and permitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>∣tion: and obeying (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) conformablie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> commaundement, cast off her whom neither law, nor right permitted him to haue, and take him to chast and lawfull marriage?</HI> Wherein although the sentence of Gods word (whereto all things ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oupe) might suffice: yet his Maiestie was contented, to haue the assisting consents of the most notable graue men, and the censures of the most famous Vniuersities of the whole world: and all to the intent, that men should see he did both that he might, &amp; ought to do vprightly, seeing the best learned, &amp; most worthy men haue subcribed to it, shewing therein such obediēce, as Gods word requireth of euerie good and godly man; so as it may be said that both he obeyed God, and obeied him truly, &amp;c. Hitherto <HI>Gardiners</HI> words. Who reading this discourse of <HI>Gardiner,</HI> concerning the kings first vnlawful, &amp; his second lawful mariage, would euer haue suspected such mutability in y<SUP>e</SUP> man? so suddainely to turne the Cat (as the Prouerbe is) in the panne, approuing that which before he openlie condemned, and condemning that which before he publikely approued? or who noting this his incon∣stancie, and not this onely, but the other of condem∣ning and abiuring the Popes Supremacie, and ear∣nest maintaining of it againe; will not thinke him a verie <HI>Proteus,</HI> which can change himselfe into all shapes, serue all times, sooth all Princes affecti∣ons, with, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, aio, negat, nego?</HI> And so I leaue, your

wauering Bishoppe, and come to your constant Car∣dinall.</P>
<P>About whom you professe to be verie briefe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinall Allen.</NOTE> but if you had not spoken in his defence at all, you had shewed yet some loue of truth, and hate of trea∣son: for as wicked <HI>Sheba</HI> blew the trumpet of sediti∣on against <HI>Dauid</HI>; so hath this your Cardinall done against her Maiestie. In my former booke, I charge him that though he seemeth to wish that Doctor <HI>Saunders,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Bristow</HI> had spared to speake so much in defence of <HI>Puis Quintus</HI> his Bull against her Maiestie: yet he both affirmeth, that these two lear∣ned men, of great zeale, and excellencie, had their speciall reasons to doe so. And in another treatise, <HI>Viz.</HI> his defence of Sir <HI>William Stanlies</HI> act in giuing ouer <HI>Deuentre</HI> to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> he doth as ful∣ly approue the Bull, as anie of the other: which though I condemne (as good cause I should, being a point of so high treason, as that the Queene being by the Pope deposed, is no longer Queene no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to bee obeyed) yet you answere for him smoothly, <HI>that he must needs be of like iudgement, with Saunders and the rest: and that he might speake his mind plainely, (being in the place and dignitie that he was) when occasion should be offered.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Allens iudge∣ment of Pius Quintus Bull.</NOTE> Which in other words is as much to say, as your Cardinall must needs be of the iudgement, that the Queene was no longer Queene after the Bull published, neither might her Subiectes obey her: But yet it was good pollicie to speake spa∣ringly of that point, and for the Papistes to yeeld for a time outward obedience, to auoide the daunger of the law, till a fit time might come, either by open
<PB N="138" REF="73"/>
force, or secret treason to put the Bull in execution. And so much doe the faculties granted by <HI>Gregorie</HI> the thirteenth to <HI>Parsons,</HI> and <HI>Campion</HI> import:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parsons and Campions fa∣culties.</NOTE> which is further warranted by <HI>Saunders</HI> going after into <HI>Ire∣land</HI> with Italian and Spanish forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saunders Re∣bellion in Ire∣land</NOTE> to haue depri∣ued her Maiesty of that kingdome: which fact as you cannot deny, so will you not shew to detest in a sub∣iect against his Prince, because it was for your Pope.</P>
<P>For a further defence yet of your Cardinall, you alleadge the example of childrens sorrow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A similitude alleadged for Allens de∣fence exami∣ned.</NOTE> to see their parents at iarre, that the yonges <HI>sort are fitter to weepe and mourne, then to determine the controuersies, and that the elder sort may speake more freely, and interpose their iudgements also, (but euer with due reuerence to both parents, &amp;c.</HI>) All which by way of similitude you ap∣ply to our Queene as a mother, and your Pope as a father; and to your <HI>Saundrs, Allen, Bristow, Stapleton, &amp;c.</HI> as elder brethren, and to the Priestes and lay men in <HI>England</HI> as yonger brethren, &amp;c. which simi∣litude consisteth of nothing but dissimilitudes. For first the Pope is no way our father, and therfore our obedience, reuerence, &amp; loue, not to be deuided be∣twixt the Queene and him,<NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">The Pope no way our fa∣ther.</NOTE> as the childrens betwixt the father and mother: the Queene is our mother, both nourishing vs as a tender parent in things tem∣porall, as also in taking care for the Church of Christ in this land, in things spiritual, according to the Lords promise by the Prophet to his Church. <HI>Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and Queenes thy nurses:</HI> So did <HI>Iehosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias,</HI> amongest the Iewes; <HI>Constantine, Iustinian, Charles</HI> the great, with other like Princes amongst the Christians, commaund and
<PB N="139" REF="73"/>
make lawes in causes ecclesiasticall, and acknow∣ledged no vniuersal father-hood of your Pope. I wish he did discharge the dutie of a true spirituall father within his owne Diocesse and Bishopricke, but it is an hard testimonie that <HI>Laurentius Valla</HI> giueth him. <HI>Papas dici nomine Patres, re Parricidas,</HI> that the Popes are called fathers in name, but in deed they are Parri∣cides.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">Your elder brethren yeeld not due reue∣rence to the Queene their mother.</NOTE> Againe, if the elder brethren interpose their iudgement betwixt their Parents, by your own con∣fession it must euer be with due reuerence to both partes: this reuerence your elder brethren haue not shewed towards the Queene, (too good a mother for so vngracious Impes,) whom they not onely call he∣retike, pretended Queene, vsurper, &amp;c. but haue by all meanes sought the murthering of her sacred person. Thirdly, the yonger children (you say) <HI>must holde their peace and mourne for the contentions, but not inter∣meddle:</HI><NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">Your yonger brethren are the elders a∣gents against the Queene.</NOTE> But (Sir) your elder brethren, (whom you allow to speake) are farre enough from reach, they may safely define what they will against the Queene, and cast abroad their iudgements in railing bookes to yonger brethren, to settle in them a consent therto: Which being done, they must yet make shew not to intermeddle, to the end they may the better auoide perill to their persons, &amp; secretly hearten the people against her Maiestie.</P>
<P>Take an instance hereof, from one of your yonger brethren, one <HI>Paine</HI> a Priest:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paines pra∣ctise against her Maiestie.</NOTE> who walked no lesse closely for his safetie, then he was directed; nor lesse cunningly to corrupt the peoples hearts, then he was commanded: who from his owne mouth discouered to one <HI>Eliot,</HI> a bloudy platforme laid to destroy her
<PB N="140" REF="74"/>
iestie, and diuers of her Honorable Councell with armed men: the effecting whereof stayed onely the comming ouer of certaine Priests which were expe∣cted, &amp; in the meane time (through Gods goodnes) this horrible treason was discouered, and preuented. And <HI>Paine</HI> being asked, how they durst practise or at∣tempt any such mischieuous action? his answere was; that to kill the Queene, or to vse anie crueltie against her, or any that would take her part, was no offence to God, and that they might doe it as lawfully as to a brute beast; and to approue himselfe a fit messenger to be sent on such a bloudie errant, he affirmed that himselfe would be one of the first that should exe∣cute the same: here is one of your yonger brothers, whom all the world must confesse to be a fit son for such a father as your Pope is.</P>
<P>Besides this, your Cardinall <HI>Allen,</HI> Doctor <HI>Wor∣thington</HI> and others (as elder brethren) sent <HI>Richard Hesketh</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Lancashire</HI> and a younger brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heskets trea∣son.</NOTE> to induce the Lord <HI>Strange</HI> late Earle of <HI>Der∣bie</HI> to make a suddaine rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> and to take vpon him the title of the Crowne; assuring him from them and others, of treasure and forraine for∣ces to maintaine the same: which treason the Hono∣rable Earle dutifully detected, <HI>Hesketh</HI> himselfe con∣fessed, and bitterly cursed his elder brethren, to make him a yonger brother, to aduenture the danger of the treason, that they as elder brethren doe teach and deuise, farre enough from reach. Is this the weeping of your yonger brethren without intermedling? are these the teares? then are they of a right Crocodiles brood, which seemeth to weeepe, but it is to this end,
<PB N="141" REF="74"/>
that they may sooner kill and destroy. Nay further then this, these elder brethren commend to their yongers, treason against her Maiestie, for a point of their faith, namely, that if the Pope say the worde, none of the Papistes ought to obey her Maiestie, nor to account her Queene of <HI>England</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treason a∣gainst the Queene made a point of the popish faith and religion.</NOTE> for in the cases of conscience (as Doctor <HI>Bilson</HI> now Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester</HI> noteth) wherewith the Iesuites that came in∣to <HI>England</HI> were furnished, to the 55. Article, when they be asked whether the Bull of <HI>Pius Quintus,</HI> that was giuen out, or any Bul that the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> can hereafter giue out, all Catholikes be bound to yeeld obedience, faith, and loyaltie, to Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as to their lawfull Prince and Soueraigne? the reso∣lution is, he that demaundeth this question, asketh (in effect) whether the Pope might doe it or no: to which demaund, what a Catholike should answere it is playner then I need here to explicate. If therefore a Catholike be asked, do you beleeue that the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> may depriue Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of her crown? he must answer (not regarding any danger of death) I beleeue he may; for this questiō is a point of faith, and requireth a confessiō of (our) faith. Do not these elder brethrē (think you) dutifully put in their iudgements between these two imagined Parēts, the Queen &amp; the Pope, when they teach their yonger brethrē treason a∣gainst the Queen, for an article &amp; point of their faith?</P>
<P>To ende with this Cardinall, who (thanks be to God) ended his life before he could attaine the ex∣pected end of his traiterous dessignments: doth he not perswade that it is not onely lawfull, but honora∣ble to murther Princes for Religion? for (saith hee)
<PB N="142" REF="75"/>
<HI>There is no warre in the world, so iust, or honorable, be it ciuill, or forraine, as that which is waged for Religion:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Allen perswa∣deth it to be honorable to kill the Queene.</NOTE> Now if it be true that ciuill warre (which is the warre of Subiects against the Prince) be iust, and honourable, then is it an honourable act for Sub∣iectes to kill the Prince; for the ende proposed in warre is victorie, and the way to victorie is bloud∣shed, and slaughter, not so much of the people (who are not impugned, but for partaking with the Prince) as of the Prince himselfe, whom you seeke to depose and place an other in his steed. And this doctrine of your Cardinals, <HI>Parrie</HI> himselfe confesseth vnder his owne hand writing, did throughly resolue, confirme and strengthen him, in his diuellish purpose to kill the Queene.

<HEAD>Resistance to the fift Encounter, concerning the Iesuites.</HEAD>
<P>THe sundrie occurrents in his last <HI>Encounter</HI> about Bishop <HI>Gardiner</HI> and Cardinall <HI>Allen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The grouud of this Encoun∣ter.</NOTE> did draw from mee moe lines, then either at the first entrie I purposed, or these two worthie Prelates were wor∣thie of: Now for the ground and foundation of his long and tedious prattle in this fift <HI>Encounter,</HI> he saith he will set downe my accusation in mine own words which are these that ensue. <HI>I doe not heare that the Popes holines is so purged from ambition, or so reconciled to Religion, as he meaneth not to continue his clayme for the Supremacie, or will cease to settle the dregs of his poysonfull and superstitious doctrine amongst vs. I cannot perceiue that the thirst of Parsons and his Pew-fellowes is yet quen∣ched, for seeking the bloud of our deare Soueraigne, and in her the destruction of vs all, the cause remaining still, for which heretofore they haue sought it, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And here first like a right Hicke-scorner (as in deed scorning and rayling are the flowers wherewith hee doth garnish all his speech) hee noteth the fond and ridiculous manner of my fantasticall writing (as it is his pleasure to censure it) and because his note, if it were not worth noting, men would thinke it worth nothing: therefore hee also painteth his margent therewith, that ye might not faile to remember it, in these words [<HI>Sir Francis ridiculous.</HI>] <HI>Festus</HI> called <HI>Paul</HI> a madde man, who yet spake the words of truth and sobernes, the madnes was in <HI>Festus</HI> himselfe: e∣uen so (gentle Sir) I doubt not, but to sober men I

shall appeare to write soberlie, howsoeuer you iudge me ridiculous, and the follie shall rest in your owne bosome. And therefore I say againe, that I doe not heare, (nay more then that, I doubt I shall neuer heare) that the Popes holines is so purged from am∣bition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope will not disclaime his title of v∣surped Supre∣macie.</NOTE> or so reconciled to true Religion, &amp;c. or that the thirst of <HI>Parsons</HI> and his Pew-fellowes is yet quenched, for seeking the blood of our deere Soue∣raigne, &amp;c. And in the first you giue me a good satis∣faction, for you assure me, that your holy Pope will neuer leaue his claime for Ecclesiasticall Supremacy; because when he doth that, he must leaue to be Pope. In this I easilie beleeue you, and for this I will neuer put you to your oath, for it is hard for the Pope to cease to vsurpe other mens rights: but if you should take a solemne oath vpon your holie Masse booke, that your Popes Popedome or Supremacie was or∣dained by our Sauiour; I could not beleeue you. Therefore looke not that your bare word shall goe for a currant proofe with mee in this behalfe, seeing you haue no one title of the word of God to war∣rant it, it being manifestlie to be proued thereby, that he is wholie opposite to Christ, both in faith, man∣ners, and gouernment, which long challenge of his, and leane proofe of yours, is largelie confuted, and ouerthrowne by sundrie learned.</P>

For <HI>Marcellinus</HI> fell not onelie into heresie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marcellinus.</NOTE> but into Idolatrie, for he sacrificed to Idols: <HI>Honorius</HI> held &amp; taught the here∣sie of the <HI>Monothelites,</HI> and was therefore accursed by the sixt generall Councell, <HI>Honorio haeretico Anathe∣ma</HI>; Cursed be <HI>Honorius</HI> the heretike:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honorius.</NOTE> <HI>Liberius</HI> became an <HI>Arrian</HI> heretike:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liberius.</NOTE> <HI>Stephen</HI> fell into the error of the <HI>Donatists:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stephanus.</NOTE> and to be short, <HI>Iohn</HI> the 22.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohan. 22.</NOTE> did so notori∣ouslie erre about the state of the Soules after death, that his error was by the Diuines of <HI>Paris,</HI> with sound of Trumpets openlie condemned, in the presence of the King himselfe, who beleeued rather the <HI>Parisien</HI> Diuines in that point, then the Court of <HI>Rome.</HI> I would they were not so prone to heresie, nay authors of heresie, but that they would returne from whence they are fallen, that is, to that truth of Christian Reli∣gion which we professe, which also many Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI> for the space of some hundreths of yeares after Christ, religiouslie professed. But though you thinke the Iesuites much honoured by mee, in that I ioyne them (as you say) in slaunder and calumniation with the Pope himselfe; yet you please not to ioyne them in defence with the Popes holines, whom for a pre∣rogatiue you will handle by himselfe. And in deede I mislike not your method, for it were absurd to make the worke equall to the workeman, and to ioyne the Creator, and the creature together: for so a learned man writeth of the sect of the Iesuites, that it is <HI>Crea∣tura Papae nouissima &amp; nequissima,</HI> The last and worst creature of the Popes making.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="77"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iesuites.</NOTE>You therefore enter your plea for the Iesuites, de∣ferring the Popes cause to the last saue one, that hee might bee accompanied with the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> fol∣lowing in the last: whom yet you might, if you had followed your Booke of ceremonies, haue sent be∣fore the Pope to leade his horse by the bridle, that the Pope in his pontificalibus might haue come all behinde. But your method be at your owne choice, for defence of your Iesuites you labour and sweate amaine, but it is like <HI>Sisyphus</HI> toyle;

Your tedious and irkesome prolixitie, I will recom∣pence with all conuenient breuitie. You run a long course about the contradictors of the Iesuites, which you acknowledge to be not onely those whom you account heretikes, but sundrie Pope-Catholikes, and to them you applie the saying of the Iewes against the Christians: That the sect of the Christians was euery where spoken against, with a long idle dis∣course to the same purpose. But (Sir) all this is be∣sides the purpose, and it is apparant that all this while you doe <HI>extra chorum saltare.</HI> If you had first by Scrip∣ture proued, and strengthned the originall of your Iesuiticall societie together with their doctrine and institute of life; these places might haue seemed to serue some turne: but to seeke to raise vp a building without a sure and sound foundation, is to climbe high for a certaine, and dangerous downefall. There∣fore vnles you can fetch their foundation from the word of truth, these places of Scripture shall neuer
<PB N="147" REF="77"/>
be proued to concerne them any thing at all. A wor∣thie sect it must needes be that was so lately sounded by <HI>Ignatius Loiola,</HI> a lame Souldiour, who when hee would tricke vp these Nouices (as the Beare licketh her deformed whelpes) and send them abroade into the world, offered by himselfe and his friends 3000. hoastes or propitiatorie sacrifices to God (so many horrible blasphemies against that alone true propitia∣torie sacrifice of Christ Iesus, which was offered once, and onely once for our sinnes) thereby to ob∣taine grace and fauour to his new erected societie.</P>
<P>Concerning the profession of these Iesuites, their doctrine, their life, name, and conuersation, what is to be obiected against them, whether they be seditious troublers of Common-wealths, and seekers of Prin∣ces deaths, I neede not say any thing, since they are by so many, so plainelie handled, and laide open, and almost all the Christian world seeth, and abhorreth their treacheries.

By whose perswasions <HI>Par∣rie</HI> confessed that hee was animated and encouraged to kill the Queene; as also by the cases of conscience, which the Iesuites brought with them into <HI>England,</HI> in which they teach that it is a point of faith, that if the Pope depose her Maiestie, she is no longer to bee obeyed nor acknowledge for our Queene.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parrie harte∣ned by Iulio Palmio a Ie∣suite.</NOTE>To which may be added, that <HI>Parrie</HI> was hartened and resolued likewise by <HI>Iulio Palmio</HI> a Iesuite, to put in execution his intended treason against her Maie∣stie. And besides this, <HI>Edmund Yorke,</HI> and <HI>Richard Wil∣liams</HI> (who being apprehended confessed the same) were by <HI>Iberra</HI> the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Secretarie, hired to murther the Queene, the assignation for the pay∣ment of 40000.

Yea further, that the insa∣tiable thirst in this Iesuite after her Maiesties bloud, may be more manifest; he tolde <HI>Yorke,</HI> that seeing the English had often failed to perfourme this enterprise, if now it should not be perfourmed by <HI>Yorke</HI> and his Companie, he would afterwards imploie Strangers in it: Which in deede before this he attempted, by perswading one <HI>Patricke Cullin</HI> an <HI>Irishman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Patricke Cul∣len.</NOTE> and a Pencioner of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> to come secretly in∣to <HI>England</HI> to kill her Maiestie, and being his ghostlie Father gaue him absolution to this purpose: which <HI>Cullin</HI> being at his comming apprehended, and exa∣mined, confessed the whole, and was accordinglie condemned and executed.

A worthy example of the wise and politike Kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> to try out their treacheries, which I wish all Christian Kingdomes would follow, that so all Iesu∣ites might be perpetually banished, into <HI>Terra Virgi∣nea,</HI> or <HI>Terra Florida</HI> (with which this fellow in the entrie of his libell disporteth himselfe) from whence no daunger of them might redound to any Christi∣an Monarch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chiefe vow of Iesuits.</NOTE>Whereto the consideration of the principall vow of this new-found sect might serue to perswade.

<PB N="151" REF="79"/>
Christ to be present (as it were,) and if Iesus Christ should commaund to goe kill, they must doe so.</HI> In which vow to omit the intollerable blasphemie, that they make a sinfull man equall with God: for Gods will is the Rule of Iustice, and God doth not commaund things, because in themselues they are good; but they are therefore good and lawfull, because he com∣maundeth them; so that if God commaund <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> to kill his owne sonne, he must yeeld simplie o∣bedience, and be content to doe so:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacriledge to vow simple o∣bedience to man.</NOTE> but it is high sacriledge for any man to vsurpe this piuiledge of God; all men may and oftentimes doe erre. So that we may not thinke any thing lawfull to be done, be∣cause our superiours commaund it, but we must exa∣mine all their commaundements whether they be consonant to the reuealed will of God, which is the Rule to trie right and wrong, good and euill. <HI>Cicero</HI> an heathen man, and ledde onely by the light of na∣ture, condemneth as most wicked the resolution of <HI>Blasius,</HI> who professed that he so highly esteemed <HI>Gracchus,</HI> that he held himselfe bound to doe what∣soeuer he badde him, who being asked (as before is noted) whether if he should bidde him set the Ca∣pitole on fire? answered he would neuer bid me do so, but if he would, I would haue done it. But (I say) to omit this blasphemie, is it obscure by the example set downe in this vow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The scope of their vow.</NOTE> (if Iesus Christ should com∣maund to go kill, they must doe so) whereto this sect tendeth?

of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> territories, or for other reasons pleasing themselues, to commaund to kill, where is the safetie of Princes liues?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclusi∣on.</NOTE>Therefore leauing your Iesuites branded with <HI>Cains</HI> bloudie worke, which is proued (not by my words) but by their owne, out of their speciall vow, and by their many bloudie practises: I wish that as <HI>England</HI> breedeth no Wolues, and <HI>Ireland</HI> will beare no Snakes &amp; venemous Serpents; so these two kingdomes may neuer harbor, or foster Iesuites: who pretend the sweet name of Iesus, and come in sheeps cloathing; but inwardlie are rauening wolues, and as serpents doe hisse into the eares of Subiectes sedition and rebellion against their lawfull Soueraignes.

<P>The first exception or rather meere cauill is a∣gainst these my words that I direct to the common sort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An outward ciuill conuer∣sation.</NOTE> <HI>That though some Papistes doe shew a good out∣ward ciuill carriage in ciuill matters; yet let not that possesse you with too great a regard of them, tearming it afterward a deceitfull bayte.</HI> Whence you gather, or rather wring out two things, first that I make little ac∣count of good life in Catholikes: secondly, that I leaue good-workes to Catholikes, and reserue onely threed-bare faith to our selues. But (good Sir) there
<PB N="155" REF="81"/>
is no such matter, you misse your ayme verie much: as I know &amp; grant that not the hearers of the law but the doers shal be iustified, and that if we be not doers of the word, but hearers onely, we deceiue our owne selues, hauing no interest in those three benefits spe∣cified in our Creed by Christ purchased to the faith∣full, Forgiuenes of sinnes, Glorious resurrection of our bodies, Eternall life: so I did neuer so much as by dreame imagine any the least forwardnes to good workes in Papistes aboue vs, to whom (God forbid) that herein we should be inferiour. It seemeth you are possessed with <HI>Narcissus</HI> folly, to fall in loue with your owne shadowe, take heede of his end.</P>
<P>But I pray you are not the vulgar and common sort easilie deceiued by and outward ciuill carriage of men? Who when they see a man keepe good hospi∣talitie, giue almes to the poore, performe his word, and such like; (which are all commendable vertues) they pronounce such a man, without further enqui∣rie to be a good Christian, and a religious man: whereas many times they that doe such things, not onelie are not true Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciuill honesty to be found a∣mongst Infi∣dels &amp; Turkes.</NOTE> but professe no Reli∣gion at all: may not these then be truly said to be de∣ceitfull baites in such a man? It is written of <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostata, that he caused almes-houses to be erected, in sundrie places of his Empyre, appointing that poore Christians aswell as others, should be there re∣lieued: yeelding this reason, that sith the Christians taught to doe good not onely to friends, but to our enemies, it were ashame for them to be inferiour to Christians in doing good. Amongst Turkes, Iewes, Pagans, many things are done wisely, valiantly, iustly,
<PB N="156" REF="82"/>
and according to ciuill honestie; yet are but deceit∣full arguments to perswade to be of their Religion, and (as <HI>Chrysostome</HI> I trow tearmeth such mens out∣ward good works) as gaye apparrell put vpon a dead carcase. I haue ascribed no more to the Papists in this point, then may trulie be yeelded to the heathen: and yet the Papistes especiallie of the wealthier sort, when now the streame and course of the law goeth against them, vsing for policie much kindnes, cour∣tesie, affabilitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">True faith not without good workes.</NOTE> to the inferiour and common sort; may by this meanes winde themselues into their bo∣somes; and as a Mirmaiden with her sugred song, and the Scorpion with his fawning and smiling, meane destruction in the ende: fo by this plausible courtesie they seeke to drawe and induce to their religion, by which sugred baite many are ensnared, with the wordes of our Sauiour, <HI>Beware of false Pro∣phets, by their fruites ye shall know them, &amp;c.</HI> I gladly agree and subscribe to them, as also to the testimony of Saint <HI>Iames: Thou hast faith, and I haue workes, shew me thy faith without workes, and I will shew thee my faith by my workes.</HI> For as wee see not the soule of man (it being a spirituall substance) yet whom we see to walk, to speake, to haue sense and feeling, wee know the soule to be in that man: so faith being an inward qualitie of the soule, cannot be seene of anie but by effectes, namely good workes. And as a painted fire is no fire, because it wanteth heate, and an Image is not a man, because it wanteth sense: so no more is that faith indeed (but onely in name) which doth not fructifie by good workes; as the Church of <HI>Sardi</HI> had a name that it liued, but indeed it was dead,
<PB N="157" REF="82"/>
it was called spirituall, but was carnall. The true iusti∣fying faith must be accompanied with an holy con∣uersation: Iustification, and sanctification cannot be seuered. But being my selfe in the ranke of learners, I confesse it becommeth me to referre you, for a full answere to your blasphemy against our true doctrine of iustifycation to those that haue both learnedlie and diuinelie handled it, to the true comfort of all Gods children.</P>
<P>Now to bring you out of your wonder, for my speaking so much of deceipt and dissimulation in your Catholikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissimulation taught by Pa∣pistes.</NOTE> seeing of all other people in the Realme, these men (say you) dissemble least, &amp;c. I must pray you with patience to peruse some of your Iesuiticall instructions, discouered by one of their owne crew, some few yeeres past, in the Northparts, to a godlie learned man, who by authoritie was im∣ployed in the examination of them, and tell me how you can cleare your Recusants, I meane such of them as haue been taught these holy lessons, and apprehen∣ded them for fit to be followed, and follow them (as too manie doe) from deceipt and deepe dissimulati∣on? A seducer being sent ouer to play his part a∣mongst vs, when he was taken, did reueale (amongst many other things) to his assigned examiner these three positions following.

<PB N="158" REF="83"/>
their answeres and other behauiours, they should shew themselues as dutifull Subiects, till such time as there were <HI>certa spes victoriae:</HI> these be brought with speciall direction to be taught and perswaded, and how farre these lead wide from deepe dissimulation I appeale to the indifferent Reader, but this is no no∣ueltie in Poperie, though your dimme sight cannot discerne it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissimulation of some Pa∣pists mani∣fested.</NOTE> And I pray you (Sir) what meant sundry of your Recusants the last sommer (when all the land was in armes) to sell away their goods, and to slide out of the way themselues, when order was gi∣uen to dsarme them? did not this arguea reseruing of themselues <HI>in plenitudinem temporis,</HI> and that, they had some hope, that their <HI>certa spes victoriae</HI> was not farre off?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The threefold accusation examined.</NOTE>You proceed further to my triple accusation (as you terme it) against them, which yet is rather an admonition for due prouidence, then an accusation to draw on anie heauie punishment. I note three things. First, the harme they continually doe; se∣condly, the hurt they would doe; thirdly, their deep dissimulation:<NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">The hurt Recusants do.</NOTE> for the first, I onely insist in this one hurt, that when the Gentleman recuseth, and is borne withall, the meaner sort receiue infection and draw backe also: Likewise though the husband come to the Church, if the wife refufe, the danger redoun∣deth to the whole household, and wiues of the mea∣ner sort are by them likewise infected. Of which you make light, but it ought to be of more moment to vs; and therefore more heedfully to be seene vnto, then you desire to haue it. For how shall the child, the ser∣uant, the tenant, be forward to know the truth, when
<PB N="159" REF="83"/>
the Parent, the Master, the Land-lord refuse know∣ledge? The wifes recusancie was not so common, till men infected with popery were perswaded, that they could not be drawne by law to pay the penaltie for the wiues: and the Popes holines had a dispensation readie for the husband to goe to Church. Now that the meaner and poorer sort of women are infected by these of the wealthier, and that they when they come home, labour also to peruert their husbndes, it neither need seeme strange to you, and we that liue to serue in the countrie, finde too lamentable experi∣ence of it. For commonlie and for the most part, men proue to be such, as are they whose companie they frequent: and daily experiēce doth teach vs the tiuth of the old saying: <HI>Cum boni, cum malis conuer santur, &amp;c.</HI> When the good conuerse and keepe companie with the euill, sooner are the good by the euill corrupted, then the euill by the good conuerted. Heresie is by sundrie writers compared to the plague, as for sundry other respectes; so for this, that as the plague doth spread it infection to manie, oftentimes infecting the whole house, and reaching the venome thereof to neighbour-houses, so that it sometimes filleth the whole Towne or Citie with dead corpses: so heresie feeketh to infect manie, and to spread the poyson of it from one to another. Now those that are sicke of the plague, by a laudable policie, we seclude from companie, that so they may not infect others: grea∣ter care ought (in my opinion) to be taken of here∣tikes, that they may not raunge whither they wil, and keepe companie with whom they please, for that the danger is greater of heresie, then of the plague: for
<PB N="160" REF="84"/>
the plague killeth but the bodie, heresie killeth the soule; the plague threatneth temporall death, here∣sie eternall.</P>
<P>But you aske from what these wiues, children, ser∣uants, tenants, and husbands doe fall? and I answere, as manie of them as become Papists, fall from true Religion, and manie of them also from loyaltie and sound loue to their countrie. But you say conscience is cause of this fall, and not euill will or rebellion? and I answere, it is fancie that leadeth them rather then conscience; for <HI>conscientia</HI> must be <HI>cum scientia,</HI> conscience must be grounded vpon knowledge, and knowledge is to be fetched not from your traditio∣nall doctrine of <HI>Rome,</HI> and vnwritten verities, but from the written word of God, which is able to make a man wise to saluation, through faith which is in Ie∣sus Christ.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forcing to do against Con∣science.</NOTE>The long idle discourse that you runne, about for∣cing men to doe an act contrarie to their conscience, maketh nothing against vs, but much against your selues: for we neuer taught it, we doe not practise it, we subscribe to the whole discourse of Saint <HI>Paule,</HI> concerning the meates sacrificed to Idols, as also to the generall proposition; whereupon he groundeth that particular argument, that what soeuer is not of faith is sinne.

They were discommoned from buying and selling, from be∣queathing their goods or lands to others, or recei∣uing anie Legacies from others, yea they might not inioy their fathers inheritaunce, &amp;c.

ouer, in which kind I list not to contend with you: your cauilling and misconstruing shall briefely be laid open. My words you set downe; <HI>These ciuill ho∣nest men that vnder pretence of Conscience rebell against God in religion, and refuse to yeeld a loyall obedience to their Liege-Ladie, seeme to carrie a most lamentable resolution lurking in their bosomes against Queene, Countrie, and vs all, &amp;c. And if this be conscience, I know not what con∣science meaneth, and yet this conscience they fetch from Rome, &amp;c.</HI> You beginne with the last wordes, from which you pike out this conclusion against me, that I know not what conscience meaneth, either in nature and definition, or in practise and feeling; the first you say is past my vnderstanding, by reason my bring∣ing vp hath hnot been in schooles; the other you take vpon you to make plaine I am voide of, by my manner of writing against Catholikes, &amp;c. Surely I willingly confesse my wants in learning to be verie great, and doe bewaile my losse of time in that be∣halfe, yet this I hope I may say without suspition of vanitie or ostentation, that I laid the grounds of lear∣ning in one of the best schooles in this land, namely <HI>Winchester,</HI> and added some further building in one of the best Vniuersities in Christendome, namelie <HI>Oxford,</HI> studying there in <HI>Magdaleine</HI> Colledge vnder that worthy Doctor <HI>Humfrey,</HI> where besides my pri∣uate study, I wanted not such furtherance, as the cōfe∣rence with sundrie of the best learned in the Vniuer∣sitie could afford me; and since I left the Vniuersitie, I haue not spent so much time in hunting &amp; hawking, as you presume, although I hold them for lawfull re∣creations moderatelie vsed in the feare of God. And
<PB N="167" REF="87"/>
therefore I did long since know (I praise God) that Conscience is a part of our vnderstanding, determi∣ning of our particular actions, either with them or a∣gainst them: I knowe also that of this Conscience God onelie is Lorde, and his words and lawes, doe onely binde the same properlie; and from hence must we fetch the direction and warrant of our prac∣tise of Conscience which will not admit vs to de∣pose, and set vp, and to obey &amp; disobey Soueraignes at our pleasures, yea and to kill Princes (as your Pope giueth warrant to doe) and then to say we doe it of Conscience, but will giue me a sufficient warrantise, to condemne all such Schoolemasters and Schollers; and so Sir (not as a teacher in our Israel, but as a Scholler) I haue tolde you what Conscience is, and by that touch I haue giuen of the practise and feeling of Conscience (which must bee warranted by the word of God, and not by mens dreames, and traditi∣ons) I haue cancelled the warrant you would take to your selues, to disobey and resist the authoritie, giuen to her Maiestie from God.</P>
<P>The rest that you snarle at in these words, or in those that follow, concerning my speeches against Recusants, or any thing materiall thereto belonging, I will briefelie answere: <HI>First my tearmes of falsehoode; disloyaltie, wicked treasons, and lurking resolutions against Queene and Countrie, calling them the Catilines of our time, &amp;c.</HI> This doth moue your patience much, and for this I must vndergoe the bitter biting of your ve∣nemous and slaunderous tongue, and bee called a monstrous lyer, and calumniatour, which by a bricke wall will hazard to light vpon your selfe. For why
<PB N="168" REF="88"/>
should I be blamed to charge them with falsehoode, disloyaltie, treason, and lurking resolutions against Queene and Countrie, and to bee the very <HI>Catilines</HI> of our age, when your Popes doctrine teacheth no∣thing else, and they frame themselues in all things to obey him? When Rebellions haue been raised with∣in our owne bowels? When her Maiesties life hath so many times been shot at, and her Kingdome at∣tempted to be inuaded? And in the first two, sundrie of your Recusants false fingers haue been set on worke, and in the third the Inuaders haue promised to themselues (and so published) great assistance from them, and both for Inuasion, Rebellion, and taking away of her Highnes life; who haue been the very <HI>Catilines</HI> of our Countrie, but they? Doth not your Captaine and Cardinall <HI>Allen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinall Al∣len inciteth to Rebellion.</NOTE> openlie blow the trumpet of sedition against her Maiestie, teaching all English Papists this Catholike doctrine, that, since her excommunication, and deposition by the Pope, she hath no iust title or interest to her Crowne and Kingdome; and that no Acte done by her authoritie, since the publishing of that excommunication and deposition, hath been or can be lawfull, by the lawe of God, or man? and therefore that no man may lawfullie serue her in any action, bee it otherwise ne∣uer so iust? If <HI>Catiline</HI> himselfe were aliue, could hee more pestilentlie perswade to sedition then doth this Cardinall? And are not they <HI>Catilines</HI> mates, so ma∣ny as yeelde to the perswasion of this <HI>Catilinarian</HI> Cardinall? And what doth the dispensation graun∣ted to <HI>Parsons</HI> and <HI>Campion</HI> teach our Papists? Doth it not teach them to dissemble? Consider the wordes
<PB N="169" REF="88"/>
of the dispensation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dispensation of Gregorie 13 to Parsons and Campion.</NOTE> where in the Bull of <HI>Pius Quin∣tus</HI> all her Subiects are commaunded not to obey her, and she being excommunicate and deposed, all that doe obey her, are likewise innodate and accur∣sed (which point is perilous to the Catholikes, for if they obey her, they are in the Popes curse, and if they disobey, they are in the Queenes danger) therefore the present Pope to relieue them hath altered that part of the Bull, and dispensed with them to obey and serue her, without perill of excommunication, which dispensation is to endure, but till that it please the Pope otherwise to determine. First, they teach generallie that all which obey the Prince, by the Pope deposed; are accursed, which if it be not a sedi∣tious and <HI>Catilinarian</HI> Doctrine, let the Reader iudge.

Therefore sith earthlie King, are vnder the King of Kings, wee must so obey the inferiour, as wee diso∣bey not the Superiour. The highest King hath set downe his law to earthlie Kings, as well as others, in the two tables: if they presume to make a law, con∣trarie to this lawe, therein we are not to obey. It was not disloyaltie in the AEgyptian Midwiues, in for∣bearing to murther the male-children of the Israe∣lites at <HI>Pharaohs</HI> commaundement; nor in <HI>Obadiah</HI> in hiding the Lordes Prophets, contrarie to <HI>Achabs</HI> will; neither in the Apostles in not forbearing to preach in the name of Iesus, at the Rulers commaun∣dement; they did (as they ought) preferre obedience to God, before obedience to man, when they cannot both stand together. By all obedience then, it is plaine that I meant, true and sincere obedience from the heart, not dissembling obedience onlie for feare; as the Apostle when he perswadeth the <HI>Philippians</HI> to walke worthie of the vocation whereunto they are called, with all humblenes of minde, meaneth by all humblenes, true, sincere, inward humilitie, not counterfeite, and hypocriticall.

If the Lawes of the Prince or Countrie commaunde any thing contrarie to it, wee ought in such things not to obey our Prince, and for such things we may flie our Countrie; but yet not rebell or fight against them, as you seeke to perswade, saying that Christ alloweth greatlie of them that despise Father, Mother, Coun∣trie and Kinred, yea they are willed to hate them and make warre against them, for his sake; and conse∣quentlie also the like is willed against Princes in the same cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is <HI>N.D.</HI> his spirituall conceite as you may reade in his booke pag. 83.</NOTE> and this out of your conscienceles hart, made fit for Rebellion, you falselie and impudentlie affirme: but we say, we must hate Father and Mother as we must our life for Christ, not to doe violence to our selues, or to make warre vpon them, nor to doe a∣ny thing against either, but in comparison of Christ, and for his sake, not to regarde the losse of either; and therefore that which you adde of warring against our Countrie and Prince for Religion, as it is not in any text of holie Writ, so doe you plainelie discouer your traiterous minde, against Queene and Coun∣trie, and what was the marke you aime at, in all this wrangling against the point of obedience.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How farre England stan∣deth behol∣ding to Rome.</NOTE>To conclude, whereas this Romane aduocate saith, that this lande ought to beare more reuerence to the sea of <HI>Rome</HI> then other Nations, for that it hath recei∣ued more singular benefits from thence, namely that it was conuerted from Paganisme to Christian Re∣ligion, by the speciall diligence, labour, and industry <NOTE PLACE="marg">1</NOTE>of the same Sea.

<P>CHrist Iesus our supreame Soueraigne and Lord, that hath the Key of <HI>Dauid</HI> which openeth and no man shutteth, shutteth and no man openeth, hath made the Ward of his truth so strong, as neither pa∣pisticall nor satanicall force can preuaile against it; so that your counterfaite Ward is too weake to keepe in safetie, and strength your Romish <HI>Babell</HI> or the Bi∣shops thereof, being not onely shaken by the wise∣dome of our watchman, who keeping our <HI>Israel,</HI> doth neither slumber nor sleepe, but beaten downe by the power of his might: Therefore you vaunt before the conquest, and triumph before the victorie. As for the bickering you begin now about your Spanish King (placed as your second great Monarch before spoken of) it consisteth rather of the ordinary blowes of your biting and rayling tongue, then of anie sound matter of defence for your Kings clearing, which your foule mouthed Rhetoricke I haue spared hi∣therto to encounter, and so will I still, carrying the same mind that <HI>Cato senior</HI> did, who being abused by one of a like intemperate spirit with slaunderous and reprochful tearmes, made this answer: <HI>Impar mihi tecū est certandi cōditio, nam vt malè audire, &amp; malè dicere tibi facillimū simul &amp; promptissimū est; sic &amp; mihi malè dicere &amp; insuaue est, &amp; insuetum: i.</HI> My encountring with you is not on euen ground, for as to you it is verie facile

<P>This second Monarch of yours I acknowledge of farre more regarde in his place then your former without comparison,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of libertie of speech vsed a∣gainst Spaine.</NOTE> and of such persons bearing the iust titles of Monarches, I desire in mine owne disposition, to speake and write with all reuerence; but when I found how <HI>Rome</HI> had incited this Mo∣narch to take holde of Ambition, and vpon this hu∣mour to seeke the ruine of our Soueraigne and Countrie, and that he bent himselfe accordinglie to giue his attempts daily to that end, both by fraude and force: and when I saw how dangerouslie their practises and platformes had preuailed in the hearts of many simple superstitious Subiects, I thought it high time to possesse my Countriemen with a true taste of her Maiesties worthie parts, of the many blessings we had from God by her, and of the infi∣nite wrongs done to her, both in person, profession, and gouernment; as also to collect somewhat for their warning, of the nature of the Spanish Nation, whensoeuer and wheresoeuer they attained the So∣ueraigntie to commaund; that both the profession, person, and gouernment of our liege Ladie, might be imbraced, honoured, and obeyed; and the peoples hearts might be held free from forsaking their loyal∣tie to a lawfull Queene, and betraying the libertie of their natiue Countrie to the making way for an vsur∣ping stranger, and the bringing of this our noble na∣tion into perpetuall thraldome.

It is not vnknowne that the Iesuites gene∣rally are agents for the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and their ar∣rants commonly tend to the raising of sedition and treason, (as their practises haue shewed many waies amongst vs) to the hazard of our Prince and daun∣ger of our state; and to this end hath hee called into his Seminaries too many of our English youthes qualified with fine naturall wits, to their lamentable downefall.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this iust and important occasi∣on drew mee to set downe that short admonition or cautele of the Spaniards nature, and Spanish Kings intention: this <HI>Encounterer</HI> (whom all men may see to carrie a Spanish heart in an English bodie) not on∣lie seeketh to holde the Spaniards credite vpright,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Encoun∣terers iniuri∣ous rayling.</NOTE> a∣mong the simpler sort of our Country men, (whose further fetch therein, the godlie, wise, and politike of our Land will I doubt not more easilie find out then I can conceiue,) but belcheth out against mee from

<P>And therefore whereas the wiser sort of our nation haue learned by the lawes of morall ciuilitie, that a man must speake moderatelie of his enemie (a lesson which Papists haue not learned, no though it be their naturall Prince whome they account their enemie) yet he that speaketh truly, speaketh moderately, espe∣cially where the enemies carriage is so immoderate and outragious, as if a man had an hundreth tongues, hee were neuer able sufficiently to set it sorth. That this moderation I haue kept in speaking truly that I haue said, and saying farre lesse then the enemie de∣serued, I will shew with all conuenient breuitie: first in the Spanish Nation generally; then particularly in the Spanish King himselfe.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Experiments of the Spani∣ards pride, crueltie, &amp;c.</NOTE>You shall finde in a Catholike Frenchman intitu∣led the <HI>Anti-Spaniard,</HI> that the pride of these Spani∣ards was great, when they durst presume to take a prisoner violentlie from the Parliament Sergeant of <HI>Paris,</HI> who was conuicted and condemned of mur∣der, making him to passe through the chiefe Cham∣ber of that high and honorable Court: adde vnto that a villanous attempt offered by them (recorded in the same booke) to rauish a young damosell left worth an hundreth thousand crownes, the stopping whereof (some thinke) did hasten the Countes <HI>Ed∣mond</HI> and <HI>Horne</HI> to their deaths, who would not in∣dure such a villanie to be committed. Read you also the estate of English Fugitiues, and there you shall finde how kinde (or rather how cruell) they are to those, that haue aduentured their liues (and more then their liues) with them and for them: for when they had discontented <HI>Rowland Yor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> (who betrayed the Sconce of <HI>Zutphen</HI> to them) by putting him be∣sides the gouernment of <HI>Deuenter,</HI> doubting what might ensue thereof, by reason of his great stomacke, they found the meanes at a dinner to requite him for all his seruices with a Spanish figge, killed his Lieu∣tenant, and ransacked all that they had: when the poore Souldiours had their Captaine and Lieute∣nant murdered, and had no meanes of reliefe, they made an humble suite to <HI>Verdugo</HI> and humblie be∣sought his helpe, who for a gentle rewarde charita∣blie

cashiered them all, not giuing them one peny. You shal also reade there, that when there had been a great slaughter of the English at <HI>Rosendale</HI> without pittie, or mercie (which was more then enough) they did deale most barbarouslie with the English that were prisoners to the Italians and Burgognians, who being led quietly by those that had taken them, towards their quarter, the Spaniardes spying them cried kill, kill, and drawing their Rapiers, ranne furi∣ously vpon these naked poore soules, and killed them euerie man. Further it is worth the noting that which is written of the west Indian people (though not without remorse, and griefe) who by the faw∣ning and flattering of the Spaniard were drawne to accept his gouernment, and for a time (the poore soules) did honour them like Gods, but when they had tasted of their insolent customes, hu∣mors, and cruelties, they did so deepely and despaire∣fully detest them, as men might see the poore wret∣ches goe by companies together vp to the rockes, and throwe themselues downe into the sea.</P>

of the indifferent Reader, I will onely adde the testimonie of <HI>Paulus Iouius</HI> both a Papist, and there, fore one that will not slaunder them, especially when he compareth them with Protestants, &amp; who was an eie witnes of the thing he writeth, and therfore could not be deceiued through other mens information. He writing of the taking of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the armie of <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. (consisting of Spaniards and Italians, Papistes, and the Germane Protestants) saith, that the Germanes after the slaughter of their armed enemies at the first <HI>Encounter,</HI> laid aside their swordes, with so calme a carriage, that they set their prisoners at liber∣tie for a verie small ransom: their rage they turned a∣gainst the Churches and Images, defacing them be∣cause they were Protestantes; and did deride the Popes lawes: then speaking of the Spaniards he ad∣deth; <HI>Hispani autem astuta &amp; implacabili crudelitate acerbiores, vt abdita arcaná{que} familiarium eruerent, tor∣mentis atque supplicijs in nobilissima corpor a graffabantur, tanta auri cupiditate vt Iulij Pontificis Cadauer, multa exesum carie, eruere, &amp; anulo spoliare non dubitarent</HI>: But the Spaniardes being more bitter with a subtile and implacable crueltie, did assaile the bodies of honou∣rable personages with tortures and tormentes, to get their secret and hidden treasures, though they had beene before that, their familiars, with so great desire of gold, that they doubted not to dig vp the bodie of Pope <HI>Iulius</HI> almost consumed with rot∣tennes, and to spoile it of his ring.

they speake of our land vntrulie, and wee of them report nothing but knowne truth. And if af∣fection to Spaine preuailed not more with you then truth, you might remember and report, that manie outrages were by the Spaniardes at that time com∣mitted against our countriemen; as namely, that great tumult at <HI>Westminster</HI> betwixt our men and the Spa∣niards, whereof great mischiefe was like to haue en∣sued. What was the ground of it? in whom was the fault? was it not about two harlots? and was not the fault wholie in the Spaniardes? for whiles some Spa∣niardes committed wickednes with those strumpets, others with dags and other weapons kept the entrie of the cloistures; some of the Deanes men came in the meane space into the cloyster, at whom the Spa∣niardes discharged their dagges and hurt some of them, whereof great busines was like to follow: But you shew your selfe worse then one of the broode of <HI>Cham,</HI> who was cursed for vncouering his fa∣thers shame, for you seeke to lay shame vpon your mother <HI>England</HI> before she deserue it, to please a for∣reiner, and a sworne enemie to her.

him out of the letter of discouery which I cited, this <HI>Encounterer</HI> promiseth himselfe great aduantage a∣gainst me, the vanitie of whose conceite shall appeare by that which followeth for all his great paines ta∣ken, and his leauing no stone vnmoued whereby he might discredite either me in cyting such a letter, or the discouerer in writing it, or both. Sometimes hee seemeth to doubt whether there were any such let∣ter of discouerie sent, or whether the tale bee not wholy forged by my selfe; nay he perswadeth him∣selfe to discouer both treacherous cogging, and shameles forgery in my heart and hand. Concerning which obiection of forgerie, I doubt not but to all men indifferent it might bee sufficient for me to an∣swere, as one <HI>AEmilius Scaurus</HI> did, who being by one <HI>Varius</HI> accused of treason, made this short and plaine answer, <HI>Varius dicit, Scaurus negat; vtri creditis? Varius</HI> saith it, <HI>Scaurus</HI> denieth it, whether doe you beleeue? In like sorte if I should answere concerning this odi∣ous crime of forging and inuenting this letter, <HI>N.D.</HI> a Iesuiticall scholler and sworne Spanish obiecteth it, <HI>Francis Hostings</HI> a Christian and true hearted Eng∣lishman denieth it; whether doe you credite? The iudgements of as many as were not more then halfe Spanish would acquite mee. But yet for further eui∣dence I adde, that this discouerie was written in na∣ture of a letter from a true hearted Englishman, dwel∣ling at that time with a great man in <HI>Spaine,</HI> the name of the writer was one <HI>Iohn Bradford</HI> (not <HI>Bradford</HI> whom <HI>Boner</HI> put to death, but <HI>Bradford</HI> a Papist;) the Nobles to whom this letter was directed, were the Earles of <HI>Arundel, Shrewsbury, Pembroke</HI> with other
<PB N="204" REF="106"/>
Nobles, and these named I trust you will cleare them from being infected with the humour you imagine to be fed by him.</P>
<P>Hauing little hope to perswade the indifferent rea∣der that I forged this letter of mine owne head, hee proceedeth to seeke to discredite the certificate in it selfe. For short answere whereto, there be two things materiall of which I must say somewhat, the marri∣age it selfe of this King to Queene <HI>Marie,</HI> with the conditions thereof insisted vpon by this English Spaniard, and made a speciall colour to crush the cre∣dite of <HI>Bradfords</HI> aduertisement, and the secret intent of the King by this letter discouered. By the first, <HI>viz.</HI> the conditions of the marriage together with the Kings vsage, towards the English for a space, hee would ouerthrow the second, namely the certificate of the Kings secret meaning. But (Sir) your infe∣rence hereupon is very feeble and weake, in taking vpon you hereby to controule the aduertisement of <HI>Iohn Bradford</HI> to be false. The world hath not found it strange for some politike men to make semblance of loue when they meane nothing lesse; I will not hunt far for proofe touching the argument in hand, or for disproofe of this <HI>Encounterers</HI> wrongfull ex∣ception against me: Let the <HI>Anti-Spaniard</HI> and <HI>Mercu∣rius Gallo-Belgicus</HI> both Papists, and <HI>Emanuel Lewis</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI> in his open confession at the Guild-hall, and sundrie others suffice for my clearing, not to haue written that I did without ground of proofe in my former booke. It were not amisse to remember and consider, what moued your Popish Prelates and o∣thers to bee so busie in hand to haue Ladie <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="106"/>
now our most worthie and happie Queene, married to some Spaniard, and to bee posted ouer with her portion much about the time, that it was said, Queen <HI>Marie</HI> was with childe, and when your Catholike King was concluded to bee Protector and gouer∣nour to the issue hoped for. I dare not say (for offen∣ding your Worship) that I feare it should haue been the best of our sweet Queenes fortune, (if that match had gone forward) to haue liued with her husband in <HI>Spaine,</HI> whilest your King Catholike enioyed by v∣surpation the possession and gouernment of her Kingdome in <HI>England,</HI> to the killing of all true Eng∣lish hearts: but I dare boldlie say that many thou∣sands in <HI>England</HI> doe praise God from their hearts, that she so happelie escaped so daungerous and base a match, and that we so happelie enioy so worthie and blessed a Queene.</P>
<P>The conditions of the Marriage and vsage of the King for a space being too weake an inference to dis∣proue the certificate concerning his secret meaning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The person of the discouerer considered.</NOTE> let vs in few words consider somewhat both of the person of the Discouerer, and the substance of the discouerie: I pray you (Sir) what should moue <HI>Brad∣ford</HI> to write this; but that an honest true English∣mans heart incited him thereunto? he was by profes∣sion a Papist, by habitation a Spaniard, for his Master on whom he attended was one, and being amongst them his perill was great in writing this; for if he had been discouered, his life must haue paide for it: he did it not then for hatred to Poperie, as you would sur∣mise, nor for malice to his Master with whom it ap∣peared he was in good account, nor for any hope of
<PB N="206" REF="107"/>
rewarde being farre enough off from receiuing any, but neere vnto daunger it is plaine he was, only when he heard of such a perilous plot to the vtter rooting out of his Countrey men, and ouerthrow of his flourishing Countrey, hee was forced out of the re∣morse of a true English mans heart to expose him∣selfe to the hazard of his life, by his setting downe, and sending this aduertisement to these Lords.</P>
<P>But to fill vp the discredite you desire to lay vpon <HI>Bradford</HI> for this his aduertisement so honestlie giuen to the Nobles of <HI>England,</HI> you aske <HI>How he could in Spaine discouer so great a secret that lay in the Kings breast in England?</HI> For answere I must tell you, that I hope it is not vnknowne that there was some intermission of time betweene the Kings marrying of Queene <HI>Mary</HI> and her death; besides that, when the King was in <HI>England</HI> I trust he had not all his Nobles and Coun∣sellors with him: if this were consulted on, and con∣cluded before the marriage, he might then get notice of it; if it were concluded on after the marriage, why might not this be brought to his Master and others into <HI>Spaine,</HI> by letters from some of the Nobles that were with the King here? So that this is but a poore shift to discredite <HI>Bradfords</HI> aduertisement, and the circumstances considered that I did set downe be∣fore of his being a Papist in profession, in dwelling a Spaniard, and in place not to write this without pe∣rill, I doubt not but to euery one in whom reason ru∣leth and not passion, it will proue probable enough that there might bee a iust cause of such an aduer∣tisement.</P>

And so farther proceeding, and with many teares pittying the extreame miserie this land was like to come vnto, he brake out into these words: <HI>My friendes, I counsaile you earnestly to looke to your selues, and to prouide the reme∣die in time, least it come vpon you vnwares; your King for a season hath kept you vnder, but if Lodowicke preuaile he will put you from all. &amp;c.</HI> Had <HI>Lodowicke</HI> so treache∣rous an intent when our Nobles so highly fauoured him, and shal it seeme strange that King <HI>Philip</HI> should haue such a secret meaning? did a Frenchman and an enemie vpon very remorse of conscience bewray this secret? and might not <HI>Bradford</HI> an Englishman (though a Papist) hazzard his life to discouer King <HI>Philips</HI> daungerous plot against his countrie? Or may our Chronicles recorde this purpose of <HI>Lodowicke</HI> and publish it to posteritie? and may it not be law∣full for me to set downe the discouerie of your Ca∣tholike Kings secret determination, to admonish my countrie men, to take heed how they lend aide to bring in a forraine ruler into the Realme, least per∣haps it follow that they be displaced themselues, and be made straungers in their owne land?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Taxes.</NOTE> But the taxes
<PB N="208" REF="108"/>
set downe by me as intended to be brought vpon this land you call <HI>childish toyes, such as one would not imagine that a man of Sir Francis name, house, and cal∣ling, would euer publish:</HI> But such childish toies they are, as euerie sound &amp; true Englishmā, hearing of the ser∣uile gonernment of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and feeling the freedome we liue withall in <HI>England,</HI> will from his heart praise God for the blessed freedome we liue vnder, and pray to God for euer to deliuer vs from Spaines bon∣dage, and this doe many other Nations besides vs, wherof some haue been so miserably taxed, that they haue been forced (as one doth crediblie report) to sell their beds they lie vpon to pay taxations imposed vpon them.</P>
<P>In the cloze of this, when I set downe what you say of your kings determination concerning the La∣die <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as well as the rest after, you haue refer∣red vs to that you haue set downe before of his kind∣nes to her, when she was prisoner (to which I haue made you alreadie a full answere:) you runne into your common place of railing againe, and adde; <HI>That no modest man can cease to wonder how so infamous a libell could be suffered to passe to the print, especially contai∣ning diuers personall, reprochful, contēptuous calumniations against so great &amp; potent a Prince. &amp;c.</HI> I like you wel (sir) you are fast to your friends, I wish I could find you as faithfull to your Soueraigne; then should I find you as hot (if not more hot) in raging against those of your side that haue most wretchedlie railed against her Maiestie your rightful Soueraigne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papists the only contem∣ners of princes</NOTE> (if you proue worthie to be her Subiect) wherin they haue sought to impugne her right, to defame her faith, to discre∣dit
<PB N="209" REF="108"/>
her gouernment, to touch her honour, to violate and abate the Maiestie of her place, &amp;c. But as <HI>A∣thalia</HI> fled into the Temple and cried out, treason, treason, whereas her selfe indeed was the traitour, and <HI>Hercules furens</HI> in the tragedie raged, and threat∣ned to be reuenged of those that had slaine his chil∣dren, himselfe indeed hauing slaine them, in his mad moode: so these good fellowes crie out against those that vtter opprobrious speeches against Princes, whereas themselues are the peerles and matchles men of all Christendome, in whom the saying of Saint <HI>Iude</HI> is verified: <HI>Which despise gouernment and speake euill of them which are in authoritie.</HI> I protest I am abashed and my pen trembleth to set down those intolerable calumniations that not onely forreiners, but home-borne Papistes haue vttered against her Maiestie. I know not how to compare them herein, but to the diuell the father of all slaunder and calum∣niation, for as it is written in the Reuelation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 52.</NOTE> That the Serpent did cast out of his mouth water against the women like a floud, that he might cause her to be carried away of the floud: so haue these hell hounds spued forth whole flouds of reprochfull and calumnious slaunders, thereby to darken and drown the honour of her Maiestie if they could possiblie. Remember (Sir) in what sort <HI>Bartholomaeus de miran∣da</HI> master of the Popes Pallace, behaueth himselfe to∣wards your Soueraigne, and with how villanous re∣proches he doth load her in his admonition set be∣fore the Epistle of <HI>Osorius</HI> directed to her. Remem∣ber how he raileth at her that wrote the cononiza∣tion of <HI>Didacus,</HI> who being a Spaniard, was of spe∣ciall
<PB N="210" REF="109"/>
purpose sainted by the Pope to further the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> in his intended conquest of <HI>England.</HI> And though the wiser sorte of our Nation haue learned euen by the lawes of morall ciuilitie (as your selfe confesse) that a man must speake moderately also of his enemie, yet the learned'st of our English Papistes haue not learned to speake moderatelie of their So∣ueraign, whom they ought not to reckon their ene∣my: you know how immoderatly &amp; immodestly <HI>Sta∣tion, Saunders,</HI> and <HI>Rishton</HI> (to omit others) doe raile against her, as against the Turke himselfe they could not doe worse. Now (Sir) how should that which vpon vrgent occasion (if to inuade, and seeke to con∣quer the land, and to make way thereunto by see∣king the shortning of my Soueraignes life through treasons may be reckoned an vrgent occasion) I say how should that I haue set downe against your Ca∣tholike King, anger you, if so manie opprobrious and contumelious reproaches (as you know) vttered a∣gainst your Soueraigne; and that not alone by for∣rainers, but by such as should be subiects, doe not moue you? I write against a straunger, truly; these against their Soueraign, falsely: I, to confirme sub∣iects hearts, in loyaltie and obedience to their law∣full Soueraigne; they, to corrupt Subiectes heartes, and to make them disloyall and disobedient to their Soueraigne: I, to free my countrie from all vsurpers, they, to fill their countrie with forraine go∣uernment: I, to preserue vnto vs the sincere truth of Gods Gospell; they, to thrust vpon vs a false worship by Poperie and superstition. And this shall suffice to shield and deliuer me from being harmed, or grie∣ued
<PB N="211" REF="109"/>
by your slaunders, and for all your malice to me, I am sorie you should carrie so vilde and villanous a mind, as not to be vexed to see your Soueraign so dis∣pitefully and disloyally dealt withall. But I haue now so good cause to guesse the vnsoundnes of your heart to my Soueraigne, by this your wrangling, and wic∣ked <HI>Ward-word,</HI> as I cannot expect or hope for anie good fruit of a loyall heart towardes her Maiestie from you.</P>
<P>And to confirme me and all true Subiectes in this opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">About Lopus.</NOTE> you close vp this your last <HI>Encounter</HI> with a doubt, whether <HI>Lopus</HI> euer ment to kill our deare So∣raigne; and why you should doubt I see not, but be∣cause it was not done, and with a deniall that your Catholike King should be priuie thereunto, (and yet all the Agents in it doe plainely confesse so) by the first whereof, you lewdlie labour to taxe the seat of our Soueraignes Iustice; and by the second you abuse her Maiestie and her people: and by both you offer to discredit the honourable testimonie in print, of the proofes and proceedings, by examinations be∣fore the Lords of her Maiesties Councell. In which you may finde, how <HI>Lopus</HI> was first solicited by <HI>An∣drada</HI> from <HI>Mendoza</HI> the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> Embassa∣dour in <HI>France,</HI> to poyson her Maiestie: Secondly, by the same <HI>Andrada,</HI> he was solicited by a token from <HI>Christophero de Moro</HI> (one of the Kings priuie Councell,) Thirdly by one <HI>Roderoquo Marques</HI> a <HI>Por∣tugale,</HI> vnto whom <HI>Lopus</HI> did vndertake to doe the abominable fact, for which he was profered and pro∣mised fiftie thousands crownes (which I hope can∣not be taken to be the gift of anie Subiect:) fourthly
<PB N="212" REF="110"/>
for this purpose, <HI>Lopus</HI> sent <HI>Andrada</HI> ouer to <HI>Callis</HI> to conferre with <HI>Counte Fuentes</HI> about this practise; and caused <HI>Stephano Ferrera de Gomo</HI> another <HI>Portugale</HI> to write letters to <HI>Stephano Iberra</HI> the Kings Secretary at <HI>Bruxels,</HI> to assure him &amp; <HI>Fuentes,</HI> that the detestable fact should be performed if the 50000. crownes were paid, which letter <HI>Lopus</HI> himselfe sent by one <HI>Gomes Dauila</HI> a <HI>Portugale.</HI> But <HI>Andrada</HI> not being thought fit to follow so great a cause, <HI>Ferrera</HI> was chosen to manage it, by whom the Doctor did againe assure the performance of this villanie; and then there were bils of exchaunge for the mony deliuered by the <HI>Counte Fuentes,</HI> the one from <HI>Gonzalo Gomez</HI> to <HI>Pedro de Carreras,</HI> the other from <HI>Gomez</HI> to <HI>Iohn Pallacios:</HI> And if (through the merciful prouidence of almigh∣tie God) these had not been lingered, and that in the meane time by the diligence and carefulnes of one of the Lords of her Maiesties priuie Councell the mat∣ter had not been discouered, the villanie had been at∣tempted and acted, and so brought out of doubt (as this Espaniolized champiō seemeth to haue wished) to the vnauoydable hazard of ruine in mans iudge∣ment to our Countrie and State. So haue you here vpon honorable credence plainely proued, that <HI>Lo∣pus</HI> should haue been the Actor of this villanie, that <HI>Andrada, Ferrera Gomez Dauila,</HI> and <HI>Manuell Le∣wes</HI> (all <HI>Portugales</HI>) were Agents and Messengers to him about it; that <HI>Mendoza</HI> your Kings Embassador in <HI>France, Christofero de Moro, Count Fuentes,</HI> and Se∣cretarie <HI>Iberra</HI> (all Councellors to your King) were Directors to these Agents and Messengers, and how farre your King himselfe did direct herein, let the
<PB N="213" REF="110"/>
booke tell you: And therefore haue you no cause to doubt of <HI>Lopus</HI> his bloudie meaning in this bloudie busines.</P>
<P>To returne to your selfe (Sir) I make no doubt but you desire to be beleeued in all that you haue scattered in your Libell, and not least in this last part; for if you could creepe into the secret bosomes of our English Nation, and winne credit to be beleeued, that all that you say is Gospell, you might then hope of some likelihood to preuaile in your shameles sute for toleration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His sute to the Lords.</NOTE> or alteration in Religion tendered to the Lords in your Remission immediatly following. But as it is well knowne to them all, that we haue been much blessed of God by her Maiesties gouern∣ment (although you inuert all out of your popish and traiterous affection into cursings) so I doubt not, but they all see and will acknowledge, that the true worship of God erected and established amongst vs by her Maiestie, is the verie assured and principall ground-worke of all our blessings: Religion and pie∣tie must be our safetie, and so long as wee keepe God by imbracing his truth without halting; so long shall God keepe this land safe from all malice of all our e∣nemies whatsoeuer. Therefore farre shall it be from them, so much as to lend an eare to so impudent and euill affected a Sutor, as you shew your selfe to be, in daring with shameles face to slaunder and scorne our Religion, to depraue our seat of Iustice, to harten disobedience, to excuse traitors, to darken and some∣times to defend y<SUP>e</SUP> malice of your two Monarches of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI> against our Soueraigne &amp; Queene; contrariwise when her iust commendation was set
<PB N="214" REF="111"/>
out, for being God his good instrument of many great blessings brought vnto vs, you maliciouslie turne them (as I said before) into cursings: when to the praise of almightie God mention is made of her wonderfull and happy deliuerances, both in the time of Queene <HI>Marie,</HI> and in her owne time, you doe in derision call the first a miracle of Milne-wheeles, and the second you shameleslie seeme to perswade, they were things rather feared by vs, then intended to her. When I vrge <HI>Stories</HI> traiterous and bloudie words a∣gainst her, you cunningly seeke to turne his meaning to other persons and purposes. When I condemne Cardinall <HI>Allin</HI> and Bishop <HI>Gardiners</HI> proude and pernitious dealing towards her, you fall into extraor∣dinarie high commendations of them, as if the trum∣pet of their praises for so dealing had been worthie to bee blowne ouer all the world: when I say, that we should keepe these three things safe in our breast; first our Conscience to God; secondly, our Loue to our Countrey; thirdly, our Loyaltie to our Prince, you earnestlie labour to proue that wee are not bound al∣waies to loue our Countrey, and to beare Loyaltie to our Prince, but that for Religions sake, wee must hate them and warre against them: and when I lay downe the many, and manifold wrongs most vnchri∣stianlie and vnkindly offered to her Maiestie by <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> you bend your whole force to couer all, and to proue wrongs offered by her Maiestie and our Nation to them, such is your speciall loue to these your two Monarches, and to all treasons, and Traytors plotted and encouraged by them; and so little and key-colde is your loue and dutie to her Ma∣iestie,
<PB N="215" REF="111"/>
to whom you owe all loue and obedience. But this is the fruite of <HI>Pius Quintus</HI> his Bull, the perill of which curse you will not incurre; and such is the force of your Catholike Religion and Spanish Crownes, as you will rather worship <HI>Dagon,</HI> then serue the liuing God, and giue your faith to an vsur∣ping stranger, then keepe yours giuen, and due to your lawfull Soueraigne. Yet for all this you doubt not to tender a remission of your whole answere to the iudgement of the Lords of her Maiesties Coun∣cell, by which your answere, and remission (if it bee well scanned in matter and manner) you will bee found iustlie to deserue all the titles contained in this one verse,
<Q><L>Vafer, detractor, mendax, elatus, iniquus.</L>
<L>A subtile, railing, lying, proud, &amp; treacherous man.</L></Q>
And thus much haue I aduentured to offer to the view of my Christian Countrymen in defence of my former <HI>Watch-word,</HI> collected by me out of my Christian affection to them for their benefite, that they may know I stand still constant, and confident to defend the truth of my God, against Poperie and all other heresies, to performe my Loialtie to my So∣ueraigne against all Popish Espaniolized Traytours, and treason, and to stand for the libertie of my Coun∣trie against <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> and all forraine Poten∣tates whatsoeuer; as also that my silence should not cause them to conceiue, that this masked Champi∣ons rayling tongue hath any way distempered me, or his threatning brauadoes any whit dismaied me, the first whereof I passe ouer, with little regard, accor∣ding to the Counsell of wise <HI>Salomon: It is the glorie
<PB N="216" REF="112"/>
of a man to passe by offences:</HI> the second I scorne, being sent out by a cowardlie Companion that speakes big, and dares not shew his face.</P>
<P>To conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclu∣sion.</NOTE> I delight not in warre and hostili∣tie betweene Princes, I wish peace in all States and Common-wealths, from my heart, so farre forth as may stand with the glorie of almightie God, who is the supreame author of all authoritie and gouern∣ment, and is onely to bee serued both by Prince and people, as his word prescribeth. For I confesse, <HI>Dulce est nomen pacis; res verò ipsa, tum iucunda, tum salutaris.</HI> And yet can I not subscribe to this blinde Peace-makers desire, that longeth for a Peace to the disho∣nour of God, and laboureth by a Peace to bring in his Idoll worship againe amongst vs: but I heartelie pray to my God, to preserue vs from such a Peace, and with <HI>Erasmus</HI> I affirme, <HI>Melior est talis pugna, quae Deo proximum facit, quàm pux illa quae à Deo separat.</HI> But if such a Peace may be had, as may not preiudice a good Conscience in the truth of Religion we now holde, nor impeach the safetie of our deare Queene, nor hazard bondage to our Countrie, by the gouern∣ment of forrainers and strangers; blessed bee that Peace-maker, and God almightie graunt vs such a Peace all our daies. And this haue I presumed to say in answere to this Champions Peace prayed for in the Conclusion of these his <HI>Encounters,</HI> with a minde rather to raise vp the power and pride of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> then for any good minde or meaning he hath to our Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> or <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And now to knit vp this my Resistance to euery of your rayling <HI>Encounters,</HI> (Sir <HI>N.D.</HI>) I assure my selfe
<PB N="217" REF="112"/>
you shall finde all the Protestants and Professors of Gods truth in <HI>England,</HI> as also many of those that are infected with the Romish Religion, so well resolued from your owne pen of your want of ciuilitie in ray∣ling beyond measure, and your want of a found heart to your Soueraigne and Countrie, in so highly ex∣tolling your two greatest Monarches of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> to the preiudice and touch both of Queene and Countrie (so farre forth as the power of your wicked wit and words can deuise, and perswade) as your glosing shall gaine little credite to worke my condemnation in any of their iudgements, either for any thing that was in my former booke, or for any thing contained in this latter: For I meane none o∣ther in all that is said, but a desire of confirmation to the one in a holy profession, and a reformation to the other of their being any longer seduced, and misled by <HI>Romes</HI> inchantments, and a care in both to stand firmelie and faithfullie to defend their Soueraigne and Countrey, against forraine malice and home Treason; whereunto if way should bee giuen, God should be dishonoured, our Queene endaungered, our Countrie depriued of it auncient and most com∣fortable liberties, and then what can either one or o∣ther looke for but miserie, and desolation. For what befell both to <HI>Guelphes</HI> and <HI>Gibellines</HI> when the <HI>Gibel∣lines</HI> brought in a friend of theirs called <HI>Facinus Ca∣nis,</HI> who was to haue the goods of the <HI>Guelphes</HI> for his paie? He was no sooner gotten in, but that without sparing of either, both sides were spoyled; whereof when the <HI>Gibellines</HI> complained, saying that their goods were spoyled contrarie to agreement, this
<PB N="218" REF="113"/>
their friend by them brought in answered, <HI>That themselues were Gibellines, and they should bee safe; but their goods were Guelphes and they must pay for it:</HI> Your selues can make the application; and so to your wis∣domes I leaue it, beseeching God to continue his wonted mercie towards our Queene and land, and to giue to this my aduersarie and all of his faction a better minde, if it stand with his good will and pleasure. Amen.</P>
