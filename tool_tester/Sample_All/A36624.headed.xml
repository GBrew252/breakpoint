<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable, MY Lord <HI>RADCLIFFE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THese Miscellany Poems, are by many Titles yours. The first they claim from your accept∣tance of my Promise to present them to you; before some of them were yet in being. The rest are deriv'd from your own Merit, the exactness of your Judgment in Poetry, and the candour of your Nature; easie to forgive some trivial faults when they come accompanied, with countervailing Beauties. But after all, though these are your equitable claims to a Dedi∣cation from other Poets, yet I must ac∣knowledge a Bribe in the case, which is your particular liking of my Verses. 'Tis
<PB REF="5"/>
a vanity common to all Writers, to over∣value their own productions; and 'tis bet∣ter for me to own this failing in my self, than the World to do it for me. For what other Reason have I spent my Life in so unprofitable a Study? Why am I grown Old, in seeking so barren a Reward as Fame? The same Parts and Application, which have made me a Poet, might have rais'd me to any Honours of the Gown, which are often given to Men of as little Learning and less Honesty than mv self. No Government has ever been, or ever can be, wherein Time-servers and Blockheads will not be uppermost. The Persons are only chang'd, but the same juglings in State, the same Hypocrisie in Religion, the same Self-Interest, and Mis-mannagement, will remain for ever. Blood and Mony will be lavish'd in all Ages, only for the Pre∣ferment of new Faces, with old Consci∣ences. There is too often a Jaundise in the Eyesof Great Men; they see not those whom they raise, in the same Colours with other Men. All whom they affect, look Golden to them; when the Gilding is only in
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
their own distemper'd Sight. These Con∣siderations, have given me a kind of Contempt for those who have risen by unworthy ways. I am not asham'd to be Little, when I see them so Infamously Great. Neither, do I know, why the Name of Poet should be Dishonourable to me; if I am truly one, as I hope I am; for I will never do any thing, that shall dishonour it. The Notions of Morality are known to all Men: None can pretend Ignorance of those Idea's which are In-born in Mankind: and if I see one thing, and practise the contra∣ry, I must be Disingenuous, not to acknow∣ledge a clear Truth, and Base to Act against the light of my own Conscience. For the Reputation of my Honesty, no Man can question it, who has any of his own: For that of my Poetry, it shall either stand by its own Merit; or sall for want of it. Ill Writers are usually the sharpest Censors: For they (as the best Poet, and the best Patron said), when in the full perfection of decay, turn Vinegar, and come again in Play. Thus the corruption of a Poet, is the Generation of a Critick: I mean of a
<PB REF="4"/>
Critick in the general acceptation of this Age: For formerly they were quite another Species of Men. They were Defendors of Poets, and Commentators on their Works: to Illustrate obscure Beauties; to place some passages in a better light, to redeem others from malicious Interpreta∣tions: to help out an Author's Modesty, who is not ostentatious of his Wit; and, in short, to shield him from the Ill-Nature of those Fellows, who were then call'd <HI>Zoili,</HI> and <HI>Momi,</HI> and now take upon themselves the Venerable Name of Censors. But nei∣ther <HI>Zoilus,</HI> nor he who endeavour'd to defame <HI>Virgil,</HI> were ever Adopted into the Name of Criticks by the <HI>Ancients:</HI> what their Reputation was then, we know; and their Successours in this Age deserve no better. Are our Auxiliary Forces turn'd our Enemies? Are they, who, at best, are but Wits of the Second Order, and whose only Credit amongst Readers, is what they obtain'd by being subvervient to the Fame of Writers, are these become Rebels of Slaves, and Usurpers of Subjects; or to speak in the most Honourable Terms of
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/>
them, are them from our Seconds, become Principals against us? Does the Ivy un∣dermine the Oke, which supports its weak∣ness? What labour wou'd it cost them to put in a better Line, than the worst of those which they expunge in a True Poet? <HI>Petronius,</HI> the greatest Wit perhaps of all the <HI>Romans,</HI> yet when his Envy prevail'd upon his Judgment, to fall on <HI>Lucan,</HI> he fell himself in his attempt: He perform'd worse in his Essay of the Civil War, than the Authour of the <HI>Pharsalia:</HI> and avoid∣ing his Errours, has made greater of his own. <HI>Julius Scaliger,</HI> wou'd needs turn down <HI>Homer,</HI> and Abdicate him, after the possession of Three Thousand Years: Has he succeeded in his Attempt? He has indeed shown us some of those Imperfections in him, which are incident to Humane Kind: But who had not rather be that <HI>Homer</HI> than this <HI>Scaliger?</HI> You see the same Hypercritick, when he endeavours to mend the beginning of <HI>Claudian,</HI> (a faulty Poet, and Living in a Barbarous Age;) yet how short he comes of him, and substitutes such Verses of his own, as deserve the <HI>Ferula.</HI> What a Cen∣sure
<PB REF="7"/>
has he made of <HI>Lucan,</HI> that he rather seems to Bark than Sing? Wou'd any but a Dog, have made so snarling a Compari∣son? One wou'd have thought, he had Learn'd Latin, as late as they tell us he did Greek. Yet he came off, with a <HI>pace tuâ,</HI> by your good leave, <HI>Lucan;</HI> he call'd him not by those outrageous Names, of Fool, Booby, and Blockhead: He had somewhat more of good Manners, than his Succes∣sours, as he had much more Knowledge. We have two sorts of those Gentlemen, in our Nation: Some of them proceeding with a seeming moderation and pretence of Re∣spect, to the Dramatick Writers of the last Age, only scorn and vilifie the present Po∣ets, to set up their Predecessours. But this is only in appearance; for their real design is nothing less, than to do Honour to any Man, besides themselves. <HI>Horace</HI> took no∣tice, of such Men in his Age: <HI>Non Ingeniis favet ille, Sepultis; nostra sed impugnat; nos nostraque lividus odit.</HI> 'Tis not with an ul∣timate intention to pay Reverence to the Manes of <HI>Shakespear, Fletcher,</HI> and <HI>Ben John∣son,</HI> that they commend their Writings, but
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/>
to throw Dirt on the Writers of this Age: Their <HI>Declaration</HI> is one thing, and their Practice is another. By a seeming venera∣tion to our Fathers, they wou'd thrust out us their Lawful Issue, and Govern us them∣selves, under a specious pretence of Refor∣mation. If they could compass their in∣tent, what wou'd Wit and Learning get by such a change? If we are bad Poets, they are worse; and when any of their woful pie∣ces come abroad, the difference is so great betwixt them and good Writers, that there need no Criticisms on our part to decide it. When they describe the Writers of this Age, they draw such monstrous figures of them, as resemble none of us: Our pre∣tended Pictures are so unlike, that 'tis evi∣dent we never sate to them: They are all Grotesque; the products of their wild Ima∣ginations, things out of Nature, so far from being Copy'd from us, that they resemble nothing that ever was, or ever can be. But there is another sort of Insects, more ve∣nomous than the former. Those who ma∣nifestly aim at the destruction of our Poe∣tical Church and State. Who allow no∣thing
<PB REF="6"/>
to their Country-Men, either of this or of the former Age. These attack the Living by raking up the Ashes of the Dead. Well knowing that if they can subvert their Original Title to the Stage, we who claim under them, must fall of course. Peace be to the Venerable Shades of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> and <HI>Ben Johnson:</HI> None of the Living will pre∣sume to have any competition with them: as they were our Predecessours, so they were our Masters. We Trayl our Plays under them: but, (as at the Funerals of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperour,) our Ensigns are furl'd, or dragg'd upon the ground, in Honour to the Dead; so we may lawfully advance our own, afterwards, to show that we suc∣ceed: If less in Dignity, yet on the same Foot and Title, which we think too, we can maintain, against the Insolence of our own Janizaries. If I am the Man, as I have Reason to believe, who am seemingly Courted, and secretly Undermin'd: I think I shall be able to defend my'self, when I am openly Attacqu'd. And to shew besides, that the <HI>Greek</HI> Writers only gave us the Rudiments of a Stage, which they never
<PB REF="8" MS="y"/>
finish'd. That many of the Tragedies in the former Age amongst us, were without Comparison beyond those of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides.</HI> But at present, I have neither the leisure nor the means for such an Un∣dertaking. 'Tis ill going to Law for an Estate, with him who is in possession of it, and enjoys the present Profits, to feed his Cause. But the <HI>quantum mutatus</HI> may be remember'd in due time. In the mean while I leave the World to judge, who gave the Provocation.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is, I confess, a long di∣gression, from <HI>Miscellany Poems</HI> to <HI>Modern Tragedies:</HI> But I have the ordinary Excuse of an Injur'd Man, who will be telling his Tale unseasonably to his Betters. Though at the same time, I am certain you are so good a Friend, as to take a Concern in all things which belong to one who so truly Honours you. And besides, being your self a Critick of the Genuine sort, who have Read the best Authours, in their own Lan∣guages, who perfectly distinguish of their several Merits, and in general prefer them to the Moderns, yet, I know, you judge
<PB REF="9"/>
for the <HI>English</HI> Tragedies, against the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> as well as against the <HI>French, Ita∣lian</HI> and <HI>Spanish,</HI> of these latter Ages. In∣deed there is a vast difference, betwixt ar∣guing like <HI>Perault,</HI> in behalf of the <HI>French</HI> Poets, against <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and be∣twixt giving the <HI>English</HI> Poets their un∣doubted due, of excelling <HI>AEschylus, Euri∣pides,</HI> and <HI>Sophocles.</HI> For if we or our greater Fathers, have not yet brought the <HI>Drama</HI> to an absolute Perfection, yet at least we have carried it much farther than those An∣cient <HI>Greeks;</HI> who beginning from a <HI>Chorus,</HI> cou'd never totally exclude it, as we have done, who find it an unprofitable incum∣brance, without any necessity of Entertain∣ing it amongst us; and without the possi∣bility of establishing it here, unless it were supported by a Publick Charge. Neither can we accept of those Lay-Bishops, as some call them, who under pretence of reform∣ing the Stage, wou'd intrude themselves upon us, as our Superiours, being indeed in∣competent Judges of what is Manners, what Religion, and least of all, what is Po∣etry and Good Sense. I can tell them in
<PB REF="7" MS="y"/>
behalf of all my Fellows, that when they come to Exercise a Jurisdiction over us, they shall have the Stage to themselves, as they have the Lawrel. As little can I grant, that the <HI>French</HI> Dramatick Writers, excel the <HI>English:</HI> Our Authours as far surpass them in Genius, as our Souldiers Excel theirs in Courage: 'Tis true, in Conduct they surpass us either way: Yet that pro∣ceeds not so much from their greaterKnow∣ledge, as from the difference of Tasts in the two Nations. They content themselves with a thin Design, without Episodes, and manag'd by few Persons. Our Audience will not be pleas'd, but with variety of Ac∣cidents, an Underplot, and many Actours. They follow the Ancients too servilely, in the Mechanick Rules, and we assume too much License to our selves, in keeping them only in view, at too great a distance. But if our Audience had their Tasts, our Poets could more easily comply with them, than the <HI>French</HI> Writers cou'd come up to the Sublimity of our Thoughts, or to the difficult variety of our Designs. Howe∣ver it be, I dare establish it for a Rule of
<PB REF="8"/>
Practice on the Stage, that we are bound to please those, whom we pretend to En∣tertain: And that at any price, Religion and Good Manners only excepted. And I care not much, if I give this handle, to our bad Illiterate Poetasters, for the de∣fence of their <HI>SCRIPTIONS</HI> as they call them. There is a sort of Merit in delight∣ing the Spectatours; which is a Name more proper for them, than that of Auditours: Or else <HI>Horace</HI> is in the wrong, when he commends <HI>Lucilius</HI> for it. But these com∣mon places I mean to Treat at greater lei∣sure: In the mean time, submitting that lit∣tle I have said, to your Lordship's Appro∣bation, or your Censure, and chusing ra∣ther to Entertain you this way, as you are a Judge of Writing, than to oppress your Modesty, with other Commendations, which though they are your due, yet wou'd not be equally receiv'd, in this Satirical, and Censorious Age. That which cannot with∣out Injury be deny'd to you, is the easiness of your Conversation, far from Affectation or Pride: not denying even to Enemies, their just Praises. And this, if I wou'd dwell
<PB REF="9" MS="y"/>
on any Theme of this Nature, is no vulgar Commendation to your Lordship. Without Flattery, my Lord, you have it in your Nature, to be a Patron and Encou∣rager of Good Poets, but your Fortune has not yet put into your Hands the opportu∣nity of expressing it. What you will be hereafter, may be more than guess'd, by what you are at present. You maintain the Character of a Nobleman, without that Haughtiness which generally attends too many of the Nobility, and when you Con∣verse with Gentlemen, you forget not that you have been of their Order. You are Marryed to the Daughter of a King, who, amongst her other high Perfections, has de∣riv'd from him a Charming Behaviour, a winning Goodness, and a Majestick Person. The Muses and the Graces are the Orna∣ments of your Family. While the Muse Sings, the Grace accompanies her Voice: even the Servants of the Muses have sometimes had the Happiness to hear her; and to receive their Inspirations from her.</P>
<P>I will not give my self the liberty of go∣ing farther; for'tis so sweet to wander in
<PB REF="10"/>
a pleasing way, that I shou'd never arrive at my Journeys end. To keep my self from being belated in my Letter, and tiring your Attention, I must return to the place where I was setting out. I humbly Dedi∣cate to your Lordship, my own Labours in this Miscellany: At the same time, not arrogating to my self the Priviledge, of In∣scribing to you, the Works of others who are join'd with me, in this undertaking; over which I can pretend no right. Your Lady and You have done me the favour to hear me Read my Translations of <HI>Ovid:</HI> And you both seem'd not to be displeas'd with them. Whether it be the partiality of an Old Man to his Youngest Child, I know not: But they appear to me the best of all my Endeavours in this kind. Perhaps this Poet, is more easie to be Translated, than some others, whom I have lately attempted: Perhaps too, he was more according to my Genius. He is certainly more palatable to the Reader, than any of the <HI>Roman</HI> Wits, though some of them are more lofty, some more Instructive, and others more Correct. He had Learning enough to make him
<PB REF="10"/>
equal to the best. But as his Verse came easily, he wanted the toyl of Application to amend it. He is often luxuriant, both in his Fancy and Expressions; and as it has lately been observ'd, not always Natural. If Wit be pleasantry, he has it to excess: but if it be propriety, <HI>Lucretius, Horace,</HI> and above all <HI>Virgil</HI> are his Superiours. I have said so much of him already, in my Preface to his Heroical Epistles, that there remains little to be added in this place. For my own part, I have endeavour'd to Copy his Character what I cou'd in this Translation, even perhaps, farther than I shou'd have done; to his very Faults. Mr. <HI>Chapman</HI> in his Translation of <HI>Homer,</HI> professes to have done it somewhat paraphrastically; and that on set purpose; his Opinion being, that a good Poet is to be Translated in that manner. I remember not the Reason which he gives for it: But I suppose it is, for fear of omitting any of his Excellencies: sure I am, that if it be a Fault, 'tis much more pardonable, than that of those, who run into the other extream, of a litteral, and close Translation, where the Poet is confin'd
<PB REF="11"/>
so streightly to his Author's Words, that he wants elbow-room, to express his Elegan∣cies. He leaves him obscure; he leaves him Prose, where he sound him Verse. And no better than thus has <HI>Ovid</HI> been serv'd by the so much admir'd <HI>Sandys.</HI> This is at least the Idea which I have remaining of his Translation; for I never Read him since I was a Boy. They who take him upon Con∣tent, from the Praises which their Fathers gave him; may inform their Judgment by Reading him again: And see, (if they un∣derstand the Original) what is become of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Poetry, in his Version; whether it be not all, or the greatest part of it evapo∣rated. But this proceeded from the wrong Judgment of the Age in which he Liv'd: They neither knew good Verse, nor lov'd it; they were Scholars 'tis true, but they were Pedants. And for a just Reward of their Pedantick pains, all their Translations want to be Translated, into <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>If I Flatter not my self, or if my Friends have not Flatter'd me, I have given my Author's Sense, for the most part truly: for to mistake sometimes, is incident to all
<PB REF="11"/>
Men: And not to follow the <HI>Dutch</HI> Com∣mentatours alwaies, may be forgiven to a Man, who thinks them, in the general, hea∣vy gross-witted Fellows; fit only to gloss on their own dull Poets. But I leave a far∣ther Satire on their Wit, till I have a better opportunity, to shew how much I Love and Honour them. I have like wise attempt∣ed to restore <HI>Ovid</HI> to his Native sweetness, easiness, and smoothness; and to give my Poetry a kind of Cadence, and, as we call it, a run of Verse, as like the Original, as the <HI>English</HI> can come up to the <HI>Latin;</HI> As he seldom uses any <HI>Synalephas,</HI> so I have en∣deavour'd to avoid them, as often as I cou'd: I have likewise given him his own turns, both on the Words and on the Thought: Which I cannot say are inimitable, because I have Copyed them: and so may others, if they use the same diligence: But certainly they are wonderfully Graceful in this Poet. Since I have Nam'd the <HI>Synalepha,</HI> which is the cutting off one Vowel, imme∣diately before another, I will give an Ex∣ample of it, from <HI>Chapman's Homer</HI> which
<PB REF="12"/>
lyes before me; for the benefit of those who understand not the <HI>Latine Prosodia.</HI> 'Tis in the first Line of the Argument to the First <HI>Iliad.</HI>
<Q><L>Apollo<HI>'s Priest to th'</HI> Argive <HI>Fleet doth bring,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>There we see he makes it not the <HI>Argive,</HI> but th' <HI>Argive,</HI> to shun the shock of the two Vowels, immediately following each other. But in his Second Argument, in the same Page, he gives a bad Example of the quite contrary kind:
<Q><L>Alpha <HI>the Pray'r of</HI> Chryses <HI>Sings:</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Army's Plague, the Strife of Kings.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In these word <HI>the Armies, the</HI> ending with a Vowel, and <HI>Armies</HI> beginning with ano∣ther Vowel, without cutting off the first, which by it had been th' Armies, there re∣mains a most horrible ill-sounding-gap be∣twixt those Words. I cannot say, that I have every way observ'd the Rule of this <HI>Synalepha,</HI> in my Translation; but wheresoe∣ver I have not, 'tis a fault in sound: The
<PB REF="12"/>
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> have made it an inviola∣ble Precept in their versification; thereinfol∣lowing the severe Example of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. Our Countrymen have not yet Reform'd their Poetry so far; but content themselves with following the Licentious Practice of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> who though they sometimes use <HI>Synalepha's,</HI> yet make no diffi∣culty very often, to sound one Vowel upon another; as <HI>Homer</HI> does, in the very first line of <HI>Alpha.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 'Tis true, indeed, that in the second line, in these words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>Synalepha</HI> in revenge is twice ob∣serv'd. But it becomes us, for the sake of <HI>Euphony,</HI> rather <HI>Musas colere severiores,</HI> with the <HI>Romans;</HI> than to give into the looseness of the <HI>Grecians.</HI></P>
<P>I have tir'd my self, and have been sum∣mon'd by the Press to send away this Dedi∣cation; otherwise I had expos'd some other faults, which are daily committed by our <HI>English</HI> Poets; which, with care and ob∣servation, might be amended. For after all, our Language is both Copious, Significant, and Majestical; and might be reduc'd into
<PB REF="13"/>
a more harmonious sound. But for want of Publick Encouragement, in this <HI>Iron Age,</HI> we are so far from making any pro∣gress in the improvement of our Tongue, that in few years, we shall Speak and Write as Barbarously as our Neighbours.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding my haste, I cannot for∣bear to tell your Lordship, that there are two fragments of <HI>Homer</HI> Translated in this <HI>Miscellany;</HI> one by Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> (whom I cannot mention without the Honour which is due to his Excellent Parts, and that entire Affection which I bear him;) and the other by my self. Both the Subjects are pathe∣tical; and I am sure my Friend has added to the Tenderness which he found in the Original; and, without Flattery, surpass'd his Author. Yet I must needs say this in reference to <HI>Homer,</HI> that he is much more capable of exciting the Manly Passions, than those of Grief and Pity. To cause Admiration, is indeed the proper and adequate design of an Epick Poem: And in that he has Ex∣cell'd even <HI>Virgil.</HI> Yet, without presuming to Arraign our Master, I may venture to af∣firm, that he is somewhat too Talkative,
<PB REF="13"/>
and more than somewhat too digressive. This is so manifest, that it cannot be deny'd, in that little parcel which I have Translated, perhaps too literally: There <HI>Andromache</HI> in the midst of her Concernment, and Fright for <HI>Hector,</HI> runs off her Biass, to tell him a Story of her Pedigree, and of the lamen∣table Death of her Father, her Mother, and her Seven Brothers. The Devil was in <HI>Hector,</HI> if he knew not all this matter, as well as she who told it him; for she had been his Bed-fellow for many Years together: And if he knew it, then it must be confess'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> in this long digression, has ra∣ther given us his own Character, than that of the Fair Lady whom he Paints. His Dear Friends the Commentators, who ne∣ver fail him at a pinch, will needs excuse him, by making the present Sorrow of <HI>Andromache,</HI> to occasion the remembrance of all the past: But others think that she had enough to do with that Grief which now oppress'd her, without running for assistance to her Family. <HI>Virgil,</HI> I am confident, wou'd have omit∣ted such a work of supererrogation. But <HI>Virgil</HI> had the Gift of expressing much
<PB REF="14"/>
in little, and sometimes in silence: For though he yielded much to <HI>Homer</HI> in Invention, he more Excell'd him in his Admirable Judg∣ment. He drew the Passion of <HI>Dido</HI> for <HI>Eneas,</HI> in the most lively and most natural Colours that are imaginable: <HI>Homer</HI> was ambitious enough of moving pity; for he has attempted twice on the same subject of <HI>Hector</HI>'s death: First, when <HI>Priam,</HI> and <HI>Hecuba</HI> beheld his Corps, which was drag'd after the Chariot of <HI>Achilles;</HI> and then in the Lamentation which was made over him, when his Body was redeem'd by <HI>Priam;</HI> and the same Persons again be∣wail his death with a Chorus of others to help the cry. But if this last excite Compassion in you, as I doubt not but it will, you are more oblig'd to the Tran∣slatour than the Poet. For <HI>Homer,</HI> as I observ'd before, can move rage better than he can pity: He stirs up the iras∣cible appetite, as our Philosophers call it, he provokes to Murther, and the destru∣ction of God's Images; he forms and equips those ungodly Man killers, whom we Poets, when we flatter them, call He∣roes;
<PB REF="14"/>
a race of Men who can never enjoy quiet in themselves, 'till they have taken it from all the World. This is <HI>Homer</HI>'s Commendation, and such as it is, the Lo∣vers of Peace, or at least of more mode∣rate Heroism, will never Envy him. But let <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> contend for the Prize of Honour, betwixt themselves, I am satis∣fied they will never have a third Concurrent. I wish Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> had the leisure to Tran∣slate him, and the World the good Nature and Justice, to Encourage him in that No∣ble Design, of which he is more capable than any Man I know. The Earl of <HI>Mul∣grave,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Waller,</HI> two the best Judges of our Age, have assur'd me, that they cou'd never Read over the Translation of <HI>Chapman,</HI> without incredible Pleasure, and extreme Transport. This Admiration of theirs, must needs proceed from the Author himself: For the Translator has thrown him down as low, as harsh Numbers, im∣proper <HI>English,</HI> and a monstrous length of Verse cou'd carry him. What then wou'd he appear in the Harmonious Version, of one of the best Writers, Living in a much bet∣ter
<PB REF="15"/>
Age than was the last? I mean for versi∣fication, and the Art of Numbers; for in the <HI>Drama</HI> we have not arriv'd to the pitch of <HI>Shakespear</HI> and <HI>Ben Johnson.</HI> But here, my Lord, I am forc'd to break off abruptly, without endeavouring at a Compliment in the close. This <HI>Miscellany,</HI> is without di∣spute one of the best of the kind, which has hi∣therto been extant in our Tongue. At least, as Sir <HI>Samuel Tuke</HI> has said before me, a Modest Man may praise what's not his own. My Fellows have no need of any Protection, but I humbly recommend my part of it, as much as it deserves, to your Patronage and Acceptance, and all the rest to your Forgiveness.</P>

<HEAD><HI>THE BOOKSELLER TO THE</HI> READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAving formerly Printed two Parts of Mi∣scellany Poems, they were so very kindly receiv'd, that I had long before now En∣deavour'd to obtain a Third, had I not al∣most ever since the Publishing of the Second been Solliciting the Translating of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> and <HI>Persius.</HI> Soon after the Publishing of that Book I waited upon several Gentlemen to ask their Opinion of a Third Miscellany, who encourag'd me to endeavour it, and have considerably help'd me in it.</P>
<P>Many very Ingenious Copies were sent to me upon my giving publick notice of this Design; but had I Printed em all, the Book wou'd have swell'd to too great a bulk, and I must have delay'd the Publishing of it 'till next Term: But those omit∣ted, shall upon Order from the Authors be restored;
<PB REF="16"/>
or if the Gentlemen will be pleas'd to stay 'till next year, I shall take it as a favour to insert them in another Miscellany, which I then intend, if I find by the Sale that this proves as Entertain∣ing as the former.</P>
<P>Several Reasons encourage me to Proceed upon the endeavouring a Fourth Volume: As, That I had assurance of many Copies from Persons now out of <HI>England;</HI> which, though not yet arriv'd, I am confident will be sent in a short time, and they come from such Hands, that I can have no reason to doubt of their being very much esteem'd.</P>
<P>I would likewise willingly try if there could be an Annual Miscellany, which I believe might be an use∣ful diversion to the Ingenious. By this means care would be taken to preserve ev'ry Choice Copy that appears; whereas I have known several Celebrated Pieces so utterly lost in three or four years time after they were written, as not to be recoverable by all the search I cou'd make after 'em.</P>
<P>I was for some years together possest of several Poems of Sir <HI>Carr Scrope</HI>'s, written with his own Hand, which I in vain of late strove to recover; for as I forgot to whom I lent 'em, so I believe the Person to whom they were lent does not remember where they were borrowed: But if the present Pos∣sessour of them reads this, I beg their being return'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="16"/>
If I should go on with the Design of an Annual Miscellany, after I have procur'd some Stock to pro∣ceed upon, I will give Publick Notice of it. And I hope the Gentlemen who approve of this Design, will promote it, by sending such Copies as they judge will be acceptable.</P>

<L>OF Bodies chang'd to various Forms I sing:</L>
<L>Ye Gods, from whom these Miracles did spring,</L>
<L>Inspire my Numbers with Coelestial heat;</L>
<L>Till I, my long laborious Work compleat:</L>
<L>And add perpetual Tenour to my Rhimes,</L>
<L>Deduc'd from Nature's Birth, to <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Times</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Before the Seas, and this Terrestrial Ball,</L>
<L>And Heav'ns high Canopy, that covers all,</L>
<L>One was the Face of Nature; if a Face,</L>
<L>Rather a rude and indigested Mass:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="23"/>
A lifeless Lump, unfashion'd, and unfram'd;</L>
<L>Of jarring Seeds; and justly Chaos nam'd.</L>
<L>No Sun was lighted up, the World to view;</L>
<L>No Moon did yet her blunted Horas renew:</L>
<L>Nor yet was Earth suspended in the Skye;</L>
<L>Nor pois'd, did on her own Foundations lye:</L>
<L>Nor Seas about the Shoars their Arms had thrown;</L>
<L>But Earth and Air and Water were in one.</L>
<L>Thus Air was void of light, and Earth unstable,</L>
<L>And Waters dark Abyss unnavigable.</L>
<L>No certain Form, on any was imprest;</L>
<L>All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest.</L>
<L>For hot and cold, were in one Body fixt;</L>
<L>And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But God or Nature, while they thus contend,</L>
<L>To these intestine Discords put an end:</L>
<L>Then Earth from Air, and Seas from Earth were driv'n,</L>
<L>And grosser Air, sunk from AEtherial Heav'n.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="23"/>
Thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place;</L>
<L>The next of kin, contiguously embrace;</L>
<L>And Foes are sunder'd, by a larger space.</L>
<L>The force of Fire ascended first on high,</L>
<L>And took its dwelling in the vaulted Skie:</L>
<L>Then Air succeeds, in lightness next to Fire;</L>
<L>Whose Atoms from unactive Earth retire.</L>
<L>Earth sinks beneath, and draws a numerous throng</L>
<L>Of pondrous, thick, unweildy Seeds along.</L>
<L>About her Coasts, unruly Waters roar;</L>
<L>And, rising on a ridge, insult the Shoar.</L>
<L>Thus when the God, what ever God was he,</L>
<L>Had form'd the whole, and made the parts agree,</L>
<L>That no unequal portions might be found,</L>
<L>He moulded Earth into a spacious round:</L>
<L>Then with a breath, he gave the Winds to blow;</L>
<L>And bad the congregated Waters flow.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="24"/>
He adds the running Springs, and standing Lakes;</L>
<L>And bounding Banks for winding Rivers makes.</L>
<L>Some part, in Earth are swallow'd up, the most</L>
<L>In ample Oceans, disimbogu'd, are lost.</L>
<L>He shades the Woods, the Vallies he restrains</L>
<L>With Rocky Mountains, and extends the Plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And as five Zones th'AEtherial Regions bind,</L>
<L>Five Correspondent, are to Earth assign'd:</L>
<L>The Sun with Rays, directly darting down,</L>
<L>Fires all beneath, and fries the middle Zone:</L>
<L>The two beneath the distant Poles, complain</L>
<L>Of endless Winter, and perpetual Rain.</L>

Nature beheld her self, and stood aghast,</L>
<L>A dismal Desart, and a silent waste.</L>

<LG>
<L>Which when <HI>Deucalion,</HI> with a piteous look</L>

<L>Oh Wife, oh Sister, oh of all thy kind</L>
<L>The best and only Creature left behind,</L>
<L>By Kindred, Love, and now by Dangers joyn'd,</L>
<L>Of Multitudes, who breath'd the common Air,</L>
<L>We two remain; a Species in a pair:</L>
<L>The rest the Seas have swallow'd; nor have we</L>
<L>Ev'n of this wretched life a certainty.</L>
<L>The Clouds are still above; and, while I speak,</L>
<L>A second Deluge, o're our heads may break.</L>
<L>Shou'd I be snatch'd from hence, and thou remain,</L>
<L>Without relief, or Partner of thy pain,</L>
<L>How cou'd'st thou such a wretched Life sustain?</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="38"/>
Shou'd I be left, and thou be lost, the Sea</L>
<L>That bury'd her I lov'd, shou'd bury me.</L>
<L>Oh cou'd our Father his old Arts inspire,</L>
<L>And make me Heir of his informing Fire,</L>
<L>That so I might abolisht Man retrieve,</L>
<L>And perisht People in new Souls might live.</L>
<L>But Heav'n is pleas'd, nor ought we to complain,</L>
<L>That we, th' Examples of Mankind, remain.</L>
<L>He said; the careful couple joyn their Tears;</L>
<L>And then invoke the Gods, with pious Prayers.</L>
<L>Thus, in Devotion having eas'd their grief,</L>
<L>From Sacred Oracles, they seek relief.</L>
<L>And to <HI>Cephysus</HI> Brook, their way pursue:</L>
<L>The Stream was troubl'd, but the Foord they knew;</L>
<L>With living Waters, in the Fountain bred,</L>
<L>They sprinkle first, their Garments, and their Head,</L>
<L>Then took the way, which to the Temple led.</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="38"/>
The Roofs were all defil'd with Moss, and Mire,</L>
<L>The Desart Altars, void of Solemn Fire.</L>
<L>Before the Gradual, prostrate they ador'd;</L>
<L>The Pavement kiss'd, and thus the Saint implor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Righteous <HI>Themis,</HI> if the Pow'rs above</L>
<L>By Pray'rs are bent to pity, and to love,</L>

<L>If yet they can forgive; and yet be kind,</L>
<L>Tell, how we may restore, by second birth,</L>
<L>Mankind, and People desolated Earth.</L>
<L>Then thus the gracious Goddess, nodding, said;</L>
<L>Depart, and with your Vestments veil your head:</L>
<L>And stooping lowly down, with loosn'd Zones,</L>
<L>Throw each behind your backs, your mighty Mother's bones.</L>
<L>Amaz'd the pair, and mute with wonder stand,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Pyrrha</HI> first refus'd the dire command.</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="39"/>
Forbid it Heav'n, said she, that I shou'd tear</L>
<L>Those Holy Reliques from the Sepulchre:</L>

<L>This Earth our mighty Mother is, the Stones</L>
<L>In her capacious Body, are her Bones.</L>
<L>These we must cast behind: with hope and fear</L>
<L>The Woman did the new solution hear:</L>
<L>The Man diffides in his own Augury,</L>
<L>And doubts the Gods; yet both resolve to try.</L>
<L>Descending from the Mount, they first unbind</L>
<L>Their Vests, and veil'd, they cast the Stones behind:</L>
<L>The Stones (a Miracle to Mortal View,</L>
<L>But long Tradition makes it pass for true)</L>

<L>And, suppl'd into softness, as they fell,</L>

<L>And took the Rudiments of Humane Form.</L>
<L>Imperfect shapes: in Marble such are seen</L>
<L>When the rude Chizzel does the Man begin;</L>
<L>While yet the roughness of the Stone remains,</L>
<L>Without the rising Muscles, and the Veins.</L>
<L>The sappy parts, and next resembling juice,</L>
<L>Were turn'd to moisture, for the Bodies use:</L>
<L>Supplying humours, blood, and nourishment;</L>
<L>The rest, (too solid to receive a bent;)</L>
<L>Converts to bones; and what was once a vein</L>
<L>Its former Name, and Nature did retain.</L>
<L>By help of Pow'r Divine, in little space</L>
<L>What the Man threw, assum'd a Manly face;</L>
<L>And what the Wife, renew'd the Female Race.</L>

<L>Laborious life; and harden'd into care.</L>

<L>The native moisture, in its close retreat,</L>

<L>Then swell'd, and quicken'd by the vital seed.</L>
<L>And some in less, and some in longer space,</L>

<L>Thus when the <HI>Nile</HI> from <HI>Pharian</HI> Fields is fled,</L>
<L>And seeks with Ebbing Tides, his ancient Bed,</L>
<L>The sat Manure, with Heav'nly Fire is warm'd;</L>

<LG>
<L>She hopes, while <HI>Telethusa</HI> fears the day;</L>

But having done whate're she cou'd devise,</L>

<L>Then <HI>Telethusa</HI> had recourse to Pray'r,</L>

<L>Trembling with fear, great <HI>Isis</HI> they ador'd;</L>

<L>Fair Queen, whodost on fruitful <HI>Egypt</HI> smile,</L>

<L>And sev'n-fold falls of disimbogueing <HI>Nile;</HI></L>
<L>Relieve, in this our last distress, she said,</L>
<L>A suppliant Mother, and a mournful Maid.</L>
<L>Thou Goddess, thou wert present to my sight;</L>
<L>Reveal'd I saw thee, by thy own fair light:</L>
<L>I saw thee in my Dream, as now I see</L>
<L>With all thy marks of awful Majesty:</L>
<L><PB N="81" REF="62"/>
The Glorious Train, that compass'd thee around;</L>
<L>And heard the hollow Timbrels holy sound.</L>
<L>Thy Words I noted, which I still retain;</L>
<L>Let not thy Sacred Oracles be vain.</L>
<L>That <HI>Iphis</HI> lives, that I my self am free</L>
<L>From shame and punishment, I owe to thee.</L>
<L>On thy Protection, all our hopes depend:</L>
<L>Thy Counsel sav'd us, let thy Pow'r defend.</L>
</LG>

<L>Her tears pursu'd her words; and while she spoke</L>
<L>The Goddess nodded, and her Altar shook:</L>
<L>The Temple doors, as with a blast of wind,</L>
<L>Were heard to clap; the Lunar Horns that bind</L>
<L>The brows of <HI>Isis,</HI> cast a blaze around;</L>
<L>The trembling Timbrel, made a murm'ring sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some hopes these happy Omens did impart;</L>
<L>Forth went the Mother with a beating Heart:</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="63"/>
Not much in fear, nor fully satisfi'd;</L>
<L>But <HI>Iphis</HI> follow'd with a larger stride:</L>
<L>The whiteness of her Skin forsook her Face;</L>
<L>Her looks emboldn'd, with an awful Grace;</L>
<L>Her Features and her Strength together grew;</L>
<L>And her long Hair, to curling Locks withdrew.</L>
<L>Her sparkling Eyes, with Manly Vigour shone,</L>
<L>Big was her Voice, Audacious was her Tone.</L>
<L>The latent Parts, at length reveal'd, began</L>
<L>To shoot, and spread, and burnish into Man.</L>
<L>The Maid becomes a Youth; no more delay</L>
<L>Your Vows, but look, and confidently pay.</L>
<L>Their Gifts, the Parents to the Temple bear:</L>
<L>The Votive Tables, this Inscription wear;</L>
<L><HI>Iphis</HI> the Man, has to the Goddess paid,</L>
<L>The Vows that <HI>Iphis</HI> offer'd, when a Maid.</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>ACIS,</HI> the Lovely Youth, whose loss I mourn,</L>
<L>From <HI>Faunus</HI> and the Nymph <HI>Symethis</HI> born,</L>
<L>Was both his Parents pleasure: but, to me</L>
<L>Was all that Love cou'd make a Lover be.</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="64"/>
The Gods our Minds in mutual Bands did joyn;</L>
<L>I was his only Joy, as he was mine.</L>
<L>Now sixteen Summers the sweet Youth had seen;</L>
<L>And doubtful Down, began to shade his Chin:</L>
<L>When <HI>Polyphemus</HI> first disturb'd our Joy;</L>
<L>And lov'd me fiercely, as I lov'd the Boy.</L>
<L>Ask not which passion in my Soul was high'r,</L>
<L>My last Aversion, or my first Desire:</L>
<L>Nor this the greater was, nor that the less:</L>
<L>Both were alike; for both were in excess.</L>
<L>Thee, <HI>Venus,</HI> thee, both Heav'n and Earth obey;</L>
<L>Immense thy Pow'r, and boundless is thy Sway.</L>
<L>The <HI>Cyclops,</HI> who desi'd th' AEtherial Throne,</L>
<L>And thought no Thunder louder than his own,</L>
<L>The terrour of the Woods, and wilder far</L>
<L>Than Wolves in Plains, or Bears in Forrests are,</L>
<L>Th' Inhumane Host, who made his bloody Feasts</L>
<L>On mangl'd Members, of his butcher'd Guests,</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="65"/>
Yet felt the force of Love, and fierce Desire,</L>
<L>And burnt for me, with unrelenting Fire.</L>
<L>Forgot his Caverns, and his woolly care,</L>
<L>Assum'd the softness of a Lover's Air;</L>
<L>And comb'd, with Teeth of Rakes, his rugged hair.</L>
<L>Now with a crooked Sythe his Beard he sleeks;</L>
<L>And mows the stubborn Stubble of his Cheeks:</L>
<L>Now, in the Crystal Stream he looks, to try</L>
<L>His Simagres, and rowls his glaring eye.</L>
<L>His Cruelty and thirst of Blood are lost;</L>
<L>And Ships securely sail along the Coast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Prophet <HI>Telemus</HI> (arriv'd by chance</L>
<L>Where <HI>AEtna</HI>'s Summets to the Seas advance,</L>
<L>Who mark'd the Tracts of every Bird that flew,</L>
<L>And sure Presages from their flying drew,)</L>
<L>Foretold the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> that <HI>Ulysses</HI> hand</L>
<L>In his broad eye, shou'd thrust a flaming Brand.</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="65"/>
The Giant, with a scornful grin reply'd,</L>
<L>Vain Augur, thou hast falsely prophesi'd;</L>
<L>Already Love, his flaming Brand has tost;</L>
<L>Looking on two fair Eyes, my sight I lost.</L>
<L>Thus, warn'd in vain, with stalking pace he strode,</L>
<L>And stamp'd the Margine of the briny Flood,</L>
<L>With heavy steps: and weary, sought agen,</L>
<L>The cool Retirement of his gloomy Den.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Promontory sharp'ning by degrees,</L>
<L>Ends in a Wedge, and over-looks the Seas:</L>
<L>On either side, below, the water flows;</L>
<L>This airy walk, the Giant Lover chose.</L>
<L>Here, on the midst he sate: his Flocks, unled,</L>
<L>Their Shepherd follow'd, and securely fed.</L>
<L>A Pine so burly, and of length so vast,</L>
<L>That sailing Ships requir'd it for a Mast,</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="66"/>
He weilded for a Staff; his steps to guide:</L>
<L>But laid it by, his Whistle while he try'd.</L>
<L>A hundred Reeds, of a prodigious growth,</L>
<L>Scarce made a Pipe, proportion'd to his mouth:</L>
<L>Which, when he gave it wind, the Rocks around,</L>
<L>And watry Plains, the dreadful hiss resound.</L>
<L>I heard the Ruffian-Shepherd rudely blow</L>
<L>Where, in a hollow Cave, I sat below;</L>
<L>On <HI>Acis</HI> bosom I my head reclin'd:</L>
<L>And still preserve the Poem in my mind.</L>

<L>Oh lovely <HI>Galatea,</HI> whiter far</L>

<L>More flowry than the Meads, as Crystal bright,</L>

Than Apples fairer, when the boughs they lade,</L>

<L>And softer to the touch, than down of Swans;</L>
<L>Or Curds new turn'd: and sweeter to the taste</L>
<L>Than swelling Grapes, that to the Vintage haste:</L>
<L>More clear than Ince, or running Streams, that stray</L>
<L>Through Garden Plots, but ah more swift than they.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, <HI>Galatea,</HI> harder to be broke,</L>
<L>Than Bullocks, unreclaim'd to bear the Yoke,</L>
<L>And far more stubborn, than the knotted Oak:</L>
<L>Like sliding Streams, impossible to hold;</L>
<L>Like them fallacious, like their Fountains cold.</L>
<L>More warping than the Willow, to decline</L>
<L>My warm Embrace, more brittle than the Vine;</L>
<L>Immoveable and fixt in thy disdain;</L>
<L>Rough as these Rocks, and of a harder grain.</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="67"/>
More violent than is the rising Flood;</L>
<L>And the prais'd Peacock is not half so proud.</L>
<L>Fierce as the Fire, and sharp as Thistles are,</L>
<L>And more outragious than a Mother-Bear:</L>
<L>Deaf as the billows to the Vows I make;</L>
<L>And more revengeful, than a trodden Snake.</L>
<L>In swiftness fleeter, than the flying Hind;</L>
<L>Or driven Tempests, or the driving Wind.</L>
<L>All other faults, with patience I can bear;</L>
<L>But swiftness is the Vice I only fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if you knew me well, you wou'd not shun</L>
<L>My Love, but to my wish'd Embraces run:</L>
<L>Wou'd languish in your turn, and court my stay;</L>
<L>And much repent of your unwise delay.</L>

<L>COu'd mournful Sighs, or floods of Tears pre∣vent</L>
<L>The ills, unhappy Men lament:</L>
<L>Cou'd all the anguish of my Mind,</L>
<L>Remove my Cares, or make but Fortune kind;</L>
<L>Soon I'd the grateful Tribute pay,</L>
<L>And weep my troubl'd Thoughts away:</L>
<L>To Wealth and Pleasure every Sigh prefer,</L>
<L>And more than Gems esteem each falling Tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">

<L>But since insulting Cares are most inclin'd</L>
<L>To triumph o're th' afflicted Mind:</L>
<L>Since Sighs can yield us no Relief,</L>
<L>And Tears, like fruitful Showers, but nourish Grief;</L>
<L>Then cease, fair Mourner, to complain,</L>
<L>Nor lavish, such bright Streams, in vain:</L>
<L>But still with chearful thoughts thy Cares beguile,</L>
<L>And tempt thy better Fortunes with a Smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>The generous Mind is by its Sufferings known,</L>
<L>Which no Affliction tramples down:</L>
<L>But when opprest will upward move,</L>
<L>Spurn down its clog of Cares, and soar above.</L>
<L>Thus the young Royal Eaglet trys</L>
<L>On the Sun-beams his tender eyes:</L>
<L>And if he shrinks not at th' offensive light,</L>
<L>He's then for Empire fit, and takes his soaring flight.</L>

<L>Tho' Cares assault thy Breast on every side,</L>

<L>No tributary Tears to Fortune pay,</L>

<L>But with kind hopes support thy mind,</L>
<L>And think thy better Lot behind:</L>
<L>Amidst afflictions let thy Soul be great,</L>

<L>Then, lovely Mourner, wipe those Tears away,</L>

<L>But keep thy looks, and mind serene,</L>
<L>All gay without, and calm within:</L>
<L>For Fate is aw'd, and adverse Fortunes fly,</L>
<L>A chearful look, and an unconquer'd Eye.</L>

<L>Welcome thou glorious Spring of light, and heat,</L>
<L>Where hast thou made thy long Retreat?</L>
<L>What Lands thy warmer Beams possest,</L>
<L>Whàt happy <HI>Indian</HI> Worlds thy fruitful Presence blest?</L>
<L>Where deep in the dark bosom of the Ground,</L>

<L>Even there thy Beams the Earth refine,</L>
<L>And mix, and stamp thy Lustre through the dazling Mine.</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="79"/>
Since thy retreat so far from our cold Isle,</L>
<L>She never wore a lovely Smile,</L>
<L>No joy her wither'd Brow adorn'd,</L>
<L>In dark unlovely Days, and in long Nights she mourn'd.</L>
<L>The poor dejected Beasts hung down their heads,</L>
<L>And trembled on their naked Beds;</L>
<L>No footsteps of green life remain,</L>
<L>But dying Fields, and Woods, and a bare, bleaky Plain.</L>
<L>The drooping Birds were silent in the Groves,</L>
<L>They quite forgot their Songs and Loves,</L>
<L>Their feeble Mates sate sullen by,</L>
<L>We thought the feather'd World resolv'd their Kind shou'd die.</L>
<L>But see the Land revives at thy approach,</L>
<L>She blooms and quickens at thy touch,</L>
<L>Her kindled Atoms life receive,</L>
<L>The Meadows, and the Groves, begin to stir and live.</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="80"/>
Mixt with thy Beams the Southern breezes blow,</L>
<L>And help the sproutng Births below,</L>
<L>The Infant Flowers in haste appear,</L>
<L>And gratefully return Perfumes to the kind Air.</L>
<L>The Trees, and Fields agen look fresh and gay,</L>
<L>The Birds begin their softer Play,</L>
<L>Thou hast their Life, nay more, their Love restor'd,</L>
<L>Their late, and early Hymns praise thee, their wel∣come Lord.</L>
<L>The spreading Fire glides through the Plains, and Woods,</L>
<L>It even pierces the cold Floods:</L>
<L>The duller Brutes feel the soft Flame,</L>
<L>The Fishes leap for joy, and wanton in their Stream.</L>

<HEAD>AGAINST THE FEAR OF DEATH. BY A <HI>Person of HONOUR.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SINCE all must certainly to Death resign,</L>
<L>Why should we make it dreadful, or repine?</L>
<L>How vain is Fear where nothing can prevent</L>
<L>The loss, which he, that loses, can't lament.</L>
<L><PB N="118" REF="81"/>
The Fear of Death is by our Folly brought,</L>
<L>We fly th' acquaintance of it, in a thought;</L>
<L>From Something into Nothing is a change</L>
<L>Grown terrible, by making it so strange.</L>
<L>We always shou'd remember, Death is sure,</L>
<L>What grows familiar most, we best endure;</L>
<L>For Life and Death succeed like Night and Day,</L>
<L>And neither gives encrease, nor brings decay.</L>
<L>No more or less by what takes Birth or dies,</L>
<L>And the same Mass the teeming World supplies.</L>
<L>From Death we rose to Life; 'tis but the same,</L>
<L>Through Life again to pass, from whence we came.</L>
<L>With shame we see our Passions can prevail,</L>
<L>Where Reason, Certainty, and Vertue fail.</L>
<L>Honour, that Empty Name, can Death despise,</L>
<L>Scorn'd Love to Death as to a Refuge flies,</L>
<L>And Sorrow waits for Death with longing Eyes.</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="81"/>
Hope triumphs o're the thought of Death, and Fate</L>
<L>Cheats Fools, and flatters the Unfortunate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps, deceiv'd by Lust-supplying Wealth,</L>
<L>New enjoy'd Pleasures, and a present Health,</L>
<L>We fear to lose, what a small time must waste,</L>
<L>Till Life it self grows the Disease at last:</L>
<L>Begging for Life, we beg for more decay,</L>
<L>And to be long a dying only pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No just and temperate thought can tell us why,</L>
<L>We should fear Death, or grieve for them that die;</L>
<L>The Time we leave behind, is ours no more,</L>
<L>Nor our concern, than Time that was before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twere a fond fight, if those that stay behind</L>
<L>For the same passage, waiting for a wind</L>
<L><PB N="120" REF="82"/>
To drive them to their Port, sho'ud on the Shore</L>
<L>Lamenting stand, for those that went before.</L>
</LG>

<L>We all must pass through Death's dead Sea of Night</L>
<L>To reach the Haven of Eternal Light.</L>

To view our endless Griefs, our groundless Fears,</L>
<L>Our hopeless Sorrows, and our fruitless Tears,</L>

<L>Till weary Nature with its Load opprest,</L>
<L>Compos'd the tempest of his troubled Breast,</L>
<L>And borrow'd from his Grief some time for rest:</L>
<L>When Sleep (Death's Image) to his fancy brought</L>
<L>The hourly Object of his waking Thought;</L>
<L>And lo! his Mother's awful Shade appears,</L>
<L>Not pale and ghastly, as the sullen Fears</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="83"/>
Of brain-sick Minds their dismal Phantomes paint,</L>
<L>But bright and joyful as a new-made Saint.</L>
<L>A Crown of Glories shone around her Head;</L>
<L>She smil'd, and thus the happy Spirit said.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail, Noble Son, whom pow'rful Fates design</L>
<L>To fill the Glories of thy mighty Line,</L>
<L>In whom the Good is mingled with the Great,</L>
<L>As generous Light unites with active heat:</L>
<L>For thee I thought Life pleasant, and for thee</L>
<L>I after Death endur'd this World to see,</L>
<L>And leave a while the Dwellings of the Blest,</L>
<L>Where Heav'nly Minds enjoy Eternal Rest;</L>
<L>Where having reach'd the Universal Shore,</L>
<L>I fear the Winds and Billows now no more;</L>
<L>No more in anguish draw a painful Breath,</L>
<L>Nor wrestle with that mighty Tyrant, Death,</L>
<L><PB N="124" REF="84"/>
Who cannot boast he gave the Fatal blow,</L>
<L>I conquer'd Sin, from whence his Pow'r did flow:</L>
<L>The proud Insulter threatn'd me in vain,</L>
<L>For Heav'n increas'd my Patience with my Pain,</L>
<L>Till my unfetter'd Soul at last took Wing,</L>
<L>The Grave its Conquest lost, and Death its Sting.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No longer then these Pious Sorrows shed,</L>
<L>Nor vainly think thy happy Parent dead;</L>
<L>Whose deathless Mind from its weak Prison free,</L>
<L>Enjoys in Heav'n its Native Liberty:</L>
<L>I soon distinguish'd in that blissful Place</L>
<L>Thy God-like Ancestors, a numerous Race;</L>
<L>There plac'd among the Stars, in them I see</L>
<L>A Glorious Destiny reserv'd for thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then weep no more; ev'n here I still survive</L>
<L>In thee, and in thy Virtuous Fair I live:</L>
<L><PB N="125" REF="84"/>
I saw her happy Mother shine on high,</L>
<L>A brighter Spirit ne're adorn'd the Skie;</L>
<L>With Joy she met me at the Crystal Gate,</L>
<L>And much enquir'd her beauteous Daughter's State,</L>
<L>She Wish'd her there; but Heav'n ordains it late,</L>
<L>And long defers her Joys, that she may be</L>
<L>A mighty Blessing to this World, and Thee.</L>
<L>Long shall she live, and Ages yet to come</L>
<L>Shall bless the happy Burden of her Womb:</L>
<L>Still shall her Off-spring, with her Years, increase,</L>
<L>With both, her Virtues, and thy Happiness.</L>
<L>In all thy Race the wondring World shall find</L>
<L>The Noble Image of each Parent's Mind.</L>
<L>Thus bless'd in her and hers, thou shalt receive</L>
<L>The richest Bounties Heav'n and Earth can give.</L>
<L>Nor shall my Care be wanting to your aid,</L>
<L>My faithful Spirit shall hover o're thy head,</L>

<L>With awe, and gravely first with Death debate.</L>
<L>They kindle slowly, but when once on Fire,</L>
<L>Burn on, and in the blaze of Fame expire.</L>

<L>Hail Princess! hail! thou fairest of thy Kind!</L>
<L>Thou shape of Angels, with an Angel's Mind!</L>
<L>Whose Vertues shine, but so as to be born,</L>
<L>Clear as the Sun, and gentle as the Morn.</L>
<L>Whose brighter Eyes like lambent Glories move,</L>
<L>And ev'ry glance wounds like a Dart of Love.</L>
<L>How well, oh Prince, how nobly hast thou fought,</L>
<L>Since to thy Arms the Fates such <HI>Beauty</HI> brought!</L>

Methinks I hear thee in thy Nuptial Bed,</L>

<L>I saw them launch, the Prince the Princess bore,</L>

<L>The Prince still bowing on the Deck did stand,</L>
<L>And held his weeping Princess by the hand.</L>

Which waving oft, she bid them all farewell,</L>
<L>And wept as if she wou'd the Ocean swell.</L>

<L>Farewel! thou best of Fathers, best of Friends!</L>
<L>While the mov'd Duke, with a heav'd Sigh, com∣mends</L>

<L>But Manly Vertue binds them to the brim.</L>
<L>Farewel (she cry'd) my Sister, thou dear part,</L>
<L>Thou sweetest part, of my divided Heart.</L>
<L>To whom I all my Secrets did unfold,</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT Introductory to this Translation.</HEAD>
<P>Hector<HI>'s Body, (after he was slain) remain'd still in the Possession of</HI> Achilles; <HI>for which,</HI> Priam <HI>made great Lamentation.</HI> Jupiter <HI>had pity on him, and
<PB N="208" REF="126"/>
sent</HI> Iris <HI>to comfort and direct him, after what manner he should go to</HI> Achilles<HI>'s Tent, and how he should there ransom the Body of his Son.</HI> Priam <HI>accordingly orders his Chariot to be got ready, and preparing rich Presents for</HI> Achilles, <HI>sets for∣ward to the</HI> Grecian <HI>Camp, accompany'd by no body but his Herald</HI> Idaeus. Mercury, <HI>at</HI> Jupi∣ter<HI>'s Command, meets him by the way, in the Fi∣gure of a young</HI> Grecian, <HI>and, after bemoaning his misfortunes, undertakes to drive his Chariot, unob∣served, through the Guards, and to the door of</HI> A∣chilles<HI>'s Tent: which having perform'd, he disco∣ver'd himself a God, and giving him a short In∣struction, how to move</HI> Achilles <HI>to Compassion, flew up to Heaven.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>SO spake the <HI>God,</HI> and Heav'nward took his flight:</L>
<L>When <HI>Priam</HI> from his Chariot did alight;</L>
<L>Leaving <HI>Idoeus</HI> there, alone he went</L>
<L>With Solemn pace, into <HI>Achilles</HI> Tent.</L>
<L>Heedless, he pass'd through various Rooms of State,</L>
<L>Until approaching where the <HI>Hero</HI> sate;</L>
<L>There at a Feast, the good old <HI>Priam</HI> found</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI>'s best belov'd, with all his Chiefs around:</L>
<L><PB N="209" REF="126"/>
Two only were t' attend his Person plac'd,</L>
<L><HI>Automedon</HI> and <HI>Alcymus;</HI> the rest</L>
<L>At greater distance, greater State express'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Priam,</HI> unseen by these, his entrance made,</L>
<L>And at <HI>Achilles</HI> Feet his <HI>Aged Body</HI> laid,</L>
<L>About his Knees, his trembling <HI>Arms</HI> he threw,</L>
<L>And clasp'd 'em hard, as, they together grew;</L>
<L>Then, caught his Hands, and press'd, and kiss'd 'em close,</L>
<L>Those Hands, th' inhumane Authors of his Woes;</L>
<L>Those Hands, whose unrelenting Force had cost</L>
<L>Much of his blood, (for many Sons he lost)</L>
<L>Now bath'd in tears, he to his Cheeks did lay,</L>
<L>As if he meant to wash their Guilt away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, as a Wretch who has a Murder done,</L>
<L>And seeking Refuge, does from Justice run;</L>
<L><PB N="210" REF="127"/>
Entring some House, in haste, where he's unknown,</L>
<L>Creates amazement in the lookers on:</L>
<L>So did <HI>Achilles</HI> gaze, surpriz'd to see</L>
<L>The Godlike <HI>Priam</HI>'s <HI>Royal Misery;</HI></L>
<L>All on each other gaz'd, all in surprize</L>
<L>And mute, yet seem'd to question with their Eyes.</L>
<L>Till he at length the Solemn silence broke;</L>
<L>And thus the venerable Suppliant spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Divine <HI>Achilles,</HI> at your Feet behold</L>
<L>A prostrate King, in wretchedness grown old:</L>
<L>Think on your Father, and then, look on me,</L>
<L>His hoary <HI>Age</HI> and helpless person see;</L>
<L>So furrow'd are his Cheeks, so white his Hairs,</L>
<L>Such, and so many his declining Years;</L>
<L>Cou'd you imagine (but that cannot be)</L>
<L>Cou'd you imagine such, his Misery!</L>
<L><PB N="211" REF="127"/>
Yet it may come, when, he shall be oppress'd,</L>
<L>And Neighb'ring Princes lay his Country waste;</L>
<L>Nay, at this time perhaps some pow'rful Foe,</L>
<L>Who will no Mercy, no Compassion show,</L>
<L>Ent'ring his Palace, sees him feebly fly,</L>
<L>And seek Protection, where no help is nigh.</L>
<L>In vain, he may your fatal absence mourn,</L>
<L>And wish in vain for your delay'd return;</L>
<L>Yet, that he hears you live, some comfort gives,</L>
<L>And while he hopes (tho' vainly) he believes:</L>
<L>It glads his Soul to think, he once may see</L>
<L>His much-lov'd Son; wou'd that were granted me!</L>
<L>But I, most wretched I! of all bereft!</L>
<L>Of all my Royal Sons, how few are left!</L>
<L>Yet fifty goodly Youths I had to boast,</L>
<L>When firsts the <HI>Greeks</HI> invaded <HI>Ilion</HI>'s Coast:</L>
<L>Nineteen, the joyful Issue of one teeming Womb,</L>
<L>Are now, alas! a mournful Tribute to one Tomb:</L>
<L><PB N="212" REF="128"/>
Merciless War, this devastation wrought,</L>
<L>And their strong Nerves to Dissolution brought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still one was left, in whom was all my hope,</L>
<L>My Age's comfort, and his Country's prop;</L>
<L><HI>Hector,</HI> my Darling, and my <HI>last Defence,</HI></L>
<L>Whose life alone, their deaths cou'd recompence:</L>
<L>And, to compleat my store of countless Woe,</L>
<L>Him you have slain—of him bereav'd me too!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For his sake only, hither am I come;</L>
<L>Rich Gifts I bring, and Wealth, an endless Sum;</L>
<L>All to redeem that fatal Prize you won,</L>
<L>A worthless Ransom for so brave a Son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fear the just Gods, <HI>Achilles;</HI> and on me</L>
<L>With pity look, think you your Father see;</L>
<L><PB N="213" REF="128"/>
Such as I am, he is, alone in this,</L>
<L>I can no equal have in Miseries;</L>
<L>Of all Mankind, most wretched and forlorn,</L>
<L>Bow'd with such weight, as never has been born;</L>
<L>Reduc'd to kneel and pray to you, from whom</L>
<L>The Spring and Source of all my Sorrows come;</L>
<L>With Gifts, to court mine and my Country's <HI>Bane,</HI></L>
<L>And kiss those hands, which have my Children slain.</L>
<L>He spake.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, sadness o're <HI>Achilles</HI> face appears,</L>
<L>And viewing <HI>Priam,</HI> for his Father fears;</L>
<L>That, and Compassion melt him into Tears.</L>
<L>Then, gently with his hand he put away</L>
<L>Old <HI>Priam</HI>'s Face, but he, still prostrate lay,</L>
<L>And there with tears, and sighs, afresh did moan</L>
<L>Th' untimely death, of his beloved Son.</L>
<L><PB N="214" REF="129"/>
But Passion diff'rent ways, <HI>Achilles</HI> turns,</L>
<L>Now, he <HI>Patroclus,</HI> now, his Father mourns:</L>

<L>Three gloomy Years against this day were set:</L>
<L>But this one mighty Sum has clear'd the Debt.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Dream, but with a better doom;</L>
<L>The Famine past, the Plenty still to come.</L>
<L>For Her the weeping Heav'ns become serene,</L>

<L>But awful Charms on her fair Forehead sit,</L>
<L>Dispensing what she never will admit.</L>

<L>Distemper'd Zeal, Sedition, canker'd Hate,</L>
<L>No more shall vex the Church, and tear the State;</L>
<L>No more shall Faction civil Discords move,</L>
<L>Or only Discords of too tender Love:</L>
<L>Discord like that of Musick's various parts,</L>
<L>Discord that makes the harmony of Hearts,</L>

<L>Can neither Injuries of Time, or Age,</L>
<L>Damp thy Poetick Heat, and quench thy Rage?</L>
<L>Not so thy <HI>Ovid</HI> in his Exile wrote,</L>
<L>Grief chill'd his <HI>Breast,</HI> and checkt his <HI>rising Thought;</HI></L>
<L>Pensive and sad, his drooping Muse betrays</L>

<L>Turn'd yellow by degrees, and ripen'd into Gold:</L>
<L>How some in Feathers, or a ragged Hide</L>

<L>TRust me, my <HI>Atticus,</HI> in Love are Wars;</L>

<L>The Age that's fit for War best suits with Love,</L>
<L>The old in both unserviceable prove,</L>
<L>Infirm in War, and impotent in Love:</L>
<L>The Souldiers which a General does require</L>
<L>Are such as Ladies wou'd in Bed desire:</L>
<L>Who, but a Souldier and a Lover, can</L>
<L>Bear the Night's cold in show'rs of Hail and Rain?</L>
<L>One in continual Watch his station keeps,</L>
<L>Or on the Earth in broken slumbers sleeps;</L>
<L><PB N="274" REF="159"/>
The other takes his still repeated round</L>
<L>By's Mistress's House—then lodges on the ground:</L>
<L>The Souldiers long and tedious Marches make:</L>
<L>The active Lover, for his Mistress sake,</L>
<L>Will any toils and dangers undergo;</L>
<L>Not rugged Mountains, nor untrodden Snow,</L>
<L>Rivers by Floods increast, no raging Sea,</L>
<L>Nor adverse Winds can ever make him stay,</L>
<L>When <HI>Love</HI> commands, and <HI>Beauty</HI> leads the way.</L>
<L>Souldiers and Lovers, with a careful Eye,</L>
<L>Observe the motions of the Enemy:</L>
<L>One to the Walls makes his approach in form,</L>
<L>Pushes the Siege, and takes the Town by Storm;</L>
<L>The other lays his close to <HI>Celia</HI>'s Fort,</L>
<L>Presses his point, and gains the wish'd-for Port:</L>
<L>As Souldiers, when the Foe securely lies</L>
<L>In Sleep and Wine dissolv'd, the Camp surprise</L>
<L><PB N="275" REF="159"/>
So when the jealous to their rest remove,</L>

<L>Regain the ground, and rout the Conquerour.</L>
<L>You then, who think that Love's an idle fit,</L>
<L>Know, that it is the exercise of Wit:</L>
<L>In flames of Love the fierce <HI>Achilles</HI> burns,</L>
<L>And quitting Arms, absent <HI>Briseis</HI> mourns:</L>

<L>The God of War was caught in th'act of Love;</L>

<L>Once did I pass my hours in sloth and ease,</L>

<L>As <HI>Helen,</HI> when to <HI>Troy</HI> she did escape,</L>
<L>And <HI>Greeks</HI> with Fire and Sword pursu'd the Rape;</L>
<L>As <HI>Leda,</HI> when the <HI>God</HI> his <HI>Love trick</HI> play'd,</L>
<L>Under the Figure of a Swan, betray'd;</L>
<L>As <HI>Amymone,</HI> wandring o're the Plains,</L>
<L>That rural Fair, admir'd by all the Swains;</L>
<L>So fair was You, so much in Love was I,</L>
<L>I ran to the extreams of Jealousie,</L>
<L>Fear'd Eagles, Bulls, and every shape that <HI>Jove</HI></L>
<L>Had e're transform'd himself into, for Love:</L>
<L>Now free from Love or Fears, my Mind's at ease,</L>
<L>Nor does that <HI>Beauty</HI> any longer please:</L>
<L><PB N="278" REF="161"/>
This humour, you may say, is wondrous strange,</L>
<L>And ask the reason of this sudden change;</L>
<L>Once, when your undesigning Heart was kind,</L>
<L>Fair was your Face, and perfect was your Mind;</L>
<L>But now the slighter <HI>Beauties</HI> of the Skin</L>
<L>Do yield to the prevailing Vice within:</L>
<L>Love is a Child, who uses no deceit,</L>
<L>Nor wears he Cloaths to cover any cheat,</L>
<L>Accepts no bribes;—why for a wretched Fee</L>
<L>Shou'd you then prostitute his Deity?</L>
<L>Make <HI>Venus</HI> to her Son serve every day,</L>
<L>And drudge i'th' meanest Offices, for pay?</L>
<L>They're softly bred, and wou'd not work, but play:</L>
<L>The Whore, to whom each Purchaser has right,</L>
<L>Forces for gain decaying appetite,</L>
<L>Yet there's a Bawd to whom the Spoils accrue;</L>
<L>She fain wou'd shun what you by choice pursue:</L>
<L><PB N="279" REF="161"/>
These sordid ways the very <HI>Brutes</HI> reprove,</L>
<L>Who by their practice teach you how to love;</L>
<L>The lusty Bull his Female does enjoy,</L>
<L>Nor can a bribe their mutual Loves destroy:</L>
<L>Woman alone rejoyces in the Spoil,</L>
<L>And makes advantages of every smile,</L>
<L>Rates at her pleasure the high-priz'd delight,</L>
<L>And Men must purchase every happy night;</L>
<L>Yet does she meet him with as much desire,</L>
<L>And no less fierce and raging is the fire;</L>
<L>Since with an equal pace our passions move,</L>
<L>Why shou'd one buy, and th' other sell in Love?</L>
<L>Why, since the pleasures mutual, shou'd it be</L>
<L>To you advantage, and a loss to me?</L>
<L>The way is infamous a Witness takes,</L>
<L>Who of his Perjury a living makes;</L>
<L>So for the raising of a low Estate</L>
<L>To set your <HI>Body</HI> at a common rate!</L>
<L><PB N="280" REF="162"/>
Can you to such mean ends as these employ</L>
<L>The gifts by Nature's bounty you enjoy?</L>
<L>Grant but the Blessing freely, and you may</L>
<L>An everlasting Obligation lay;</L>
<L>But where's the mighty favour, when we pay?</L>
<L>Forbear, ye fair, to make a Trade of Love,</L>
<L>The Wealth that's got so ill can ne're improve;</L>
<L>Justly the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tarpeia.</NOTE> Vestal by their <HI>Armour</HI> fell,</L>
<L>Who wou'd her Honour for their <HI>Bracelets</HI> sell:</L>
<L>The rich your Wishes are oblig'd to meet,</L>
<L>And lay their frequent Presents at your feet;</L>
<L><HI>Alcinous</HI> Orchards Fruit enough can spare,</L>
<L>From the full Vines the Grapes in clusters tear,</L>
<L>And ease th' o're-loaded boughs which numerous</L>
<L><HI>Apples</HI> bear:</L>
<L>Let Faith and Love supply my little Store,</L>
<L>The Will shall ne're be wanting to the Pow'r:</L>
<L><PB N="281" REF="162"/>
Verse is the greatest Tribute I can bring;</L>
<L>Your Charms I cou'd to future Ages sing;</L>
<L>Jewels and Gold will perish,—but the Fame</L>
<L>The Muses give shall ever be the same:</L>
<L>You check my generous passion when you crave,</L>
<L>Not that I'm loth to part with what I have,</L>

Her Monsters seem a Violence to sight,</L>
<L>They're form'd for Terrour, Insects to delight.</L>
<L>Thus when she nicely frames a piece of <HI>Art,</HI></L>
<L>Fine are her stroaks, and small in every part;</L>
<L>No Labour can she boast more wonderful,</L>

<L>Whenin less Volumes we more pleasure find,</L>

When weary'd out with the stupendious weight,</L>

<L>Made for Diversion, and design'd to please.</L>

<L>Those Messengers of Fate fly to provide the way,</L>
<L>To give the Signal of a gloomy Day.</L>
<L>The Moon her Tokens constantly fulfils,</L>
<L>And with her <HI>Beams</HI> points out th' approaching Ills.</L>
<L>Her waining Orb puts on a various Form</L>
<L>To give the Sign of an impending Storm.</L>
<L>When South Winds rise the Herdsmen justly fear,</L>
<L>And seek a Shelter when the Tempest's near.</L>
<L>First from a gentle blast the Winds arise,</L>
<L>Whose Infant Voice in whisp'ring Murmurs flys,</L>
<L>Then with loud Clamours fills the troubled Skies.</L>
<L>By small degrees advanc'd, it stronger grows,</L>
<L>Till every Point each other does oppose.</L>
<L>Then through the jarring Zones it frets and roars,</L>
<L>And lifts the swelling <HI>Billows</HI> to the Shores.</L>
<L><PB N="416" REF="230"/>
Vast watry Mountains rowl upon the Sand,</L>
<L>And angry Surges beat the trembling Land.</L>
<L>A harsh, shrill noise the ecchoing Caverns fills,</L>
<L>And strikes the Ear from the resounding Hills;</L>
<L>Whose <HI>Reverend Tops,</HI> with aged Pine-trees crown'd,</L>
<L>Rock with the Wind, and tremble with the sound.</L>
<L>Then threatning Surges hardly can forbear</L>
<L>The tatter'd Vessel, while the Seamen fear</L>
<L>Each rowling <HI>Billow</HI> shou'd their last appear.</L>
<L>The frightned Native of the troubled Waves</L>
<L>His long accustom'd Habitation leaves.</L>
<L>Now born aloft a winged <HI>Army</HI> soar</L>
<L>To seek for safety on a calmer Shore.</L>
<L>The More-Hen, conscious of the Tempest near,</L>
<L>Plays on the Sand, and so prevents her fear.</L>
<L>The Hern forsakes his ancient marshy <HI>Bed,</HI></L>
<L>And tow'rs to Heav'n while Clouds bedew his head.</L>
<L>Sometimes he's met by a descending Star,</L>
<L>Which warns the Tempest rushing from afar.</L>
<L><PB N="417" REF="230"/>
The headlong Planet glides in fiery Streams,</L>
<L>And shoots through Darkness with its <HI>Radiant Beams.</HI></L>
<L>It cuts the Shadows with a Train of Light,</L>
<L>And makes a Medley of the Day and Night.</L>
<L>A sportive Whirlwind lifts the moving Sand,</L>
<L>In my stick Circles dancing on the Land.</L>
<L>Now wanton Feathers whiten all the Flood;</L>
<L>And sapless Leaves fly o're the shaken Wood,</L>
<L>At distance black'ning in a dusky Cloud.</L>
<L>But when a <HI>new-fledg'd Storm</HI> comes blust'ring forth,</L>
<L>And quits the thund'ring Regions of the North:</L>
<L>When East and West in distant Poles conspire,</L>
<L>Uniting Rage, to swell the Deluge higher,</L>
<L>With rapid Streams the full-charg'd Chanels flow,</L>
<L>Collecting Forces as they farther go.</L>
<L>Th' unruly Tide no sturdy <HI>Banks</HI> controul,</L>
<L>O're unknown Plains the furious Torrents rowl.</L>
<L>The Reapers mourn to see the Deluge bear</L>
<L>Their long expected Labours of the Year.</L>

<L>THus having said, brave <HI>Hector</HI> went to see</L>

<L>From whence with heavy Heart she might survey</L>
<L>The bloody business of the dreadful Day.</L>
<L>Her mournful Eyes she cast around the Plain,</L>
<L>And sought the Lord of her Desires in vain.</L>

<L>But he, who thought his peopled Palace bare,</L>
<L>When she, his only Comfort, was not there;</L>
<L>Stood in the Gate, and ask'd of ev'ry one,</L>
<L>Which way she took, and whither she was gone:</L>
<L>If to the Court, or with his Mother's Train,</L>
<L>In long Procession to <HI>Minerva</HI>'s Fane?</L>

The Servants answer'd, neither to the Court</L>

<L>Nor to the Temple was she gone, to move</L>

<L>But, more solicitous for him alone,</L>
<L>Than all their safety, to the Tow'r was gone,</L>
<L>There to survey the Labours of the Field;</L>

<L>Th'admiring Throng divide, to give him way:</L>

His Wife, who brought in Dow'r <HI>Cilicia</HI>'s Crown;</L>

<L>Breathless she flew, with Joy and Passion wild,</L>
<L>The Nurse came lagging after with her Child.</L>

<L>The <HI>Royal Babe</HI> upon her <HI>Breast</HI> was laid;</L>

<L><HI>Hector</HI> beheld him with a silent Smile,</L>

<L>Employ'd in Works that Womankind become.</L>
<L>The Toils of War, and Feats of Chivalry</L>
<L>Belong to Men, and most of all to me.</L>
<L>At this, for new Replies he did not stay,</L>
<L>But lac'd his Crested Helm, and strode away:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His lovely Consort to her House return'd:</L>
<L>And looking often back in silence mourn'd:</L>
<L>Home when she came, her secret Woe she vents,</L>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Fracastorius.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FRacastorius</HI> was descended from the <HI>Fracastorian</HI> Family of great Antiquity in <HI>Verona.</HI> He seem∣ed not only to rival the Fame of <HI>Catullus</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> who had long before made that City re∣nown'd, but to have very far exceeded all his Contem∣poraries, for Learning and Poetry. His Parents were <HI>Paulo-Philippus Fracastorius,</HI> and <HI>Camilla Mascarellia,</HI> both of great Reputation. He was so well educated by his Father, that he gave early proofs of a great Genius, so that in his Childhood all men conceived hopes of an extraordinary man. Nor was Providence wanting to give him a signal Testimony, forasmuch as when he was an Infant in the Arms of his Mother, a sudden Tem∣pest arising, in which the Mother was struck dead by
<PB REF="260"/>
Lightning, the Child received no harm. He was sent for literature while very young to <HI>Padua,</HI> where even in that Age with indefatigable labour, he opened his way to that height of Glory which he afterwards attained: After the initiatory Arts he applied himself to the secrets of distinct Sciences, but infinitely delight∣ed with the Mathematicks, in all, assisted by a Memory equal to his Ingenuity. After several years spent in Philosophical studies under the Tutorship of <HI>Peter Pom∣ponatius</HI> of <HI>Mantua;</HI> he devoted himself by the dictates of his Genius to Physick, with such resolution and suc∣cess, that in the School disputations, not only his fellow Students, but most experienc'd Doctors, were sensible that he was designed by Providence for great Undertak∣ings. Accordingly they then gave him the honour of the Pulpit, which had never before been permitted to any person till they had perfected their studies, and were arrived to the years of Manhood. This School being dissolv'd by the breaking out of the War, while he had thoughts of returning to his Countrey (his Fa∣ther being then dead) he was on honourable conditions invited by <HI>Livianus,</HI> General of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Forces, and a noble Patron of Wit, to the College <HI>Forojulien∣sis,</HI> &amp;c.—and lodged in the same apartment of <HI>An∣drea Naugerus</HI> and <HI>Johannes Cottac,</HI> two excellent Poets. He had not long resided here before he published Verses on every extraordinary Occasion that happened, which were received with such general applause throughout <HI>Italy,</HI> that their fame has to this day stifled the per∣formances of his Companions. Having afterwards accompanied <HI>Livianus</HI> through many Wars, the Ge∣neral being at last overthrown and taken Prisoner by the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Abdua;</HI> he returned late into his native
<PB REF="260"/>
Countrey, where in the general devastation he found his Patrimony almost utterly destroyed.</P>
<P>He marry'd, but was soon unhappy in the loss of two Sons, whose untimely Death he bewailed in a most passionate Elegy. He was low of Stature, but of good bulk, his Shoulders broad, his Hair black and long, his Face round, his Eyes black, his Nose short and turning upwards by his continual contemplation of the Stars, a lively air was spread over his Countenance, that displayed the Serenity and Ingenuity of his Mind. He affected a quiet and private life, as being a Man free from abmitious desires; contenting himself with a moderate fortune, and placing his happiness in im∣provement of his knowledge. He was cheerful though frugal at his Table, having a constant regard to his health; his Wit being always the best part of his Ban∣quet. He was notwithstanding sparing in his Speech, and affecting no vanity in his Dress: he was never cen∣sorious of other Mens performances, but always glad of an occasion to commend; for which he was de∣servedly celebrated by <HI>Johannes Baptista</HI> in a noble E∣pigram. He spent his time in curing the diseased, a divine Power seeming always to attend his endeavours, above the sordid desire of gain, and thought himself best rewarded in the health of his Patient. By these means he contracted many friendships, and had (de∣servedly) no Enemy.</P>
<P>He was not only esteemed for his skill in his own Countrey, but was sought to by foreign Princes in desperate sickness, for which though vast rewards were offered, he brought nothing home beside their Friend∣ship.</P>
<P>In his leisure he diverted himself with reading Hi∣story, at which time <HI>Polybius,</HI> or <HI>Plutarch</HI> were never
<PB REF="261"/>
out of his hands. He sometimes relieved his Studies with Mathematicks and Musick, and made no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall performances in Cosmography. He was much alone, yet always employed; and though by reason of his backwardness to discourse, he seemed of a Saturnine Temper, yet none were more chearful and pleasant when entred into Coversation. He performed won∣ders by his exact knowledge of Herbs and Simples, by searching the best Books of the Ancients. That most excellent Antidote called <HI>Diascordium,</HI> was of his preparing; we are likewise beholding to his judg∣ment for specifying many useful Herbs, of which the Ancients had left uncertain description. The Age in which he lived saw nothing equal to his Learning, but his honesty. In his retreat from the City, while the Pestilence raged, he found leisure to compose the following Poem, a work of such elegance, that <HI>Sana∣zarius</HI> freely acknowledged it to excell his own, <HI>De partu Virginis,</HI> that had cost him above twenty years labour and correction. His Treatises in Prose and efforts of Poetry are too numerous to be recited on this occasion.</P>
<P>In all which he affected so little vanity, that he ne∣ver preserv'd a Copy; and we are beholding for what are extant, to the Industry of his Friends that collected them after his death.</P>
<P>He was above 70 years old when he dyed, which was by an Apoplexy that seiz'd him while he was at Dinner at his Countrey seat. He was Sensible of his malady, though speechless, often putting his Hand up∣on the top of his Head, by which sign he would have had his Servants administer a Cupping-Glass to the part affected, by which he had formerly cured a Nun in <HI>Verona,</HI> labouring under the same Distemper. But
<PB REF="261"/>
his Domesticks, not conceiving his meaning, apply'd first one thing and then another, till in the Evening he gently Expired. He was Interr'd at <HI>Verona:</HI> His Sta∣tue, together with that of <HI>Andrea Naugerus,</HI> delicately cast in Brass, was erected in the School of <HI>Padua</HI> by <HI>Johannes Baptista Rhamnusius.</HI> His fellow Citizens of <HI>Verona,</HI> not to be behind <HI>Rhamnusius</HI> in respect (two years after the erecting the brazen Statue in <HI>Padua)</HI> set up his Image in marble at <HI>Verona,</HI> in imitation of their Ancestours, who had performed the same ho∣nour to their <HI>Catullus</HI> and <HI>Pliny;</HI> with Laurel round their Heads.</P>

Say, Goddess, to what Cause we shall at last</L>

<L>For Fame Reports this Grief perpetual there,</L>

<L>Whole Cities Victims to its Fury fall;</L>
<L>Few scape, for what relief where vital Breath,</L>
<L>The Gate of Life, is made the Road of death?</L>
<L>If then by Traffick thence this Plague was brought,</L>
<L>How Dearly Dearly was that Traffick bought!</L>
<L>This Prodigy of sickness, weak at first,</L>

<L>When once confirm'd, with sudden rage breaks forth</L>

<L><PB N="5" REF="266"/>
So while the Shepherd travelling through the dark</L>
<L>Strikes his dim Torch, some unsuspected Spark</L>
<L>Falls in the Stubble, where it smothers long</L>

<L>Since from <HI>Pyrene</HI>'s foot, to <HI>Italy,</HI></L>
<L>It shed its Bane on <HI>France,</HI> while <HI>Spain</HI> was free.</L>

<L>Whole Ages pass before the Monster's born.</L>
<L>Diseases thus which various Seeds compound,</L>
<L>As various in their Birth and date are found.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="268"/>
Some always seen, some long in darkness hurld,</L>
<L>That break their chains at last to scourge the World.</L>
<L>To which black List this Plague must be assign'd,</L>
<L>Nights foulest Birth and Terrour of Mankind.</L>
<L>Nor must we yet think this escape the first,</L>
<L>Since former Ages with the like were curst.</L>
<L>Long since he scatter'd his Infernal flame,</L>
<L>And always Being had, though not a Name,</L>
<L>At least what Name it bore is now unfound:</L>
<L>Both Names and things in times Abyss lye drown'd,</L>
<L>How vainly then do we project to keep</L>
<L>Our Names remembred when our Bodies sleep?</L>

<L>Beneath this Pest the wretched Natives groan</L>
<L>In every Nation there and always known,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="268"/>
Such dire Effects depend upon a Clime,</L>
<L>On varying Skies and long Revolving time:</L>
<L>The temper of their Air this Plague brought forth,</L>
<L>The Soil it self dispos'd for such a Birth.</L>
<L>All things conspir'd to raise the Tyrant there,</L>
<L>But time alone cou'd fix his Conquest here.</L>
<L>If therefore more distinctly we would know</L>
<L>Each Source from whence this deadly Bane did flow,</L>
<L>His Progress in the Earth we must survey</L>
<L>How many Cities groan beneath his sway.</L>
<L>And when his great Advancement we have trac'd,</L>
<L>We must allow his Principles as vast.</L>
<L>That Earth nor Sea th' Ingredients cou'd prepare</L>
<L>And wholly must ascribe it to the Air,</L>
<L>The Tyrant's seat, his Magazine is there.</L>
<L>The Air that do's both Earth and Sea surround,</L>
<L>As easily can Earth and Sea confound;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="269"/>
What Fence for Bodies when at every pore</L>
<L>The soft Invader has an open door?</L>
<L>What fence, where poyson's drawn with vitall Breath,</L>
<L>And Father Air the Authour proves of Death?</L>
<L>Of subtile substance that with ease receives</L>
<L>Infection, which as easily it gives.</L>
<L>Now by what means this dire Contagion first,</L>
<L>Was form'd aloft, by what Ingredients nurst,</L>
<L>Our Song shall tell; and in this wondrous Course,</L>
<L>Revolving times and varying Planets force.</L>

<L>Amongst our Elements raise endless Wars;</L>
<L>And when the Planets from their Stations Range,</L>
<L>Our Orb is influenc'd, and feels the Change.</L>
<L>The chiefest instance is the Suns retreat,</L>

<L>But fruitless Fields with Snow are cover'd o'er,</L>

<L><PB N="11" REF="269"/>

<L>Some mighty work of Fate is to be done.</L>
<L>Long tracts of time indeed must first be spent,</L>

<L>What mischiefs Earth and Sea at once Invade!</L>

Poor Mortals then shall all extremes sustain</L>
<L>While Heav'n dissolves in Deluges of Rain;</L>
<L>Which from the mountains with impetuous course,</L>
<L>And headlong Rage, Trees, Rocks and Towns shall force,</L>
<L>O'er swelling <HI>Ganges</HI> then shall sweep the Plain,</L>
<L>And peacefull <HI>Poe</HI> outroar the Stormy Main.</L>
<L>In other parts the Springs as low shall lye,</L>
<L>And Nymphs with Tears, exhausted streams supply.</L>
<L>Where neither Drought nor Deluges destroy,</L>
<L>The winds their utmost fury shall employ;</L>
<L>Whlie Hurricans whole Cities shall o'erthrow,</L>
<L>Or Earthquakes Gorge them in the depths below.</L>
<L>Perhaps the Season shall arrive (if Fate</L>
<L>And Nature once agree upon the date)</L>
<L>When this most cultivated Earth shall be</L>
<L>Unpeopled quite, or drench'd beneath the Sea;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="270"/>
When ev'n the Sun another Course shall steer,</L>
<L>And other Seasons constitute the year:</L>
<L>The wondring North shall see the springing Vine,</L>
<L>And <HI>Moors</HI> admire at Snow beneath the Line.</L>
<L>New <HI>Species</HI> then of Creatures shall arise</L>
<L>A new Creation Nature's self surprise.</L>
<L>Then Youth shall lend fresh vigour to the Earth,</L>
<L>And give a second breed of Gyants birth.</L>
<L>By whom a new assault shall be perform'd,</L>
<L>Hills heap'd on Hills, and Heaven once more be storm'd.</L>
<L>Since Nature's then so lyable to change,</L>
<L>Why should we think this late Contagion strange;</L>
<L>Or that the Planets where such mischiefs grow,</L>
<L>Should shed their poyson on the Earth below?</L>
<L>Two hundred rowling years are past away,</L>

To find what Signs did former times direct,</L>
<L>And what the present Age is to expect:</L>
<L>From hence perhaps we shall with ease descry</L>
<L>The Source of this stupendious Malady.</L>
<L>Behold how <HI>Cancer</HI> with portentous harms</L>
<L>Before Heav'ns Gate unfolds his threatning Armes;</L>
<L>Prodigious ills must needs from thence ensue,</L>
<L>In which one House we may distinctly view</L>
<L>A numerous Cabal of Stars conspire,</L>
<L>To hurl at once on Air their bainsull fire.</L>
<L>All this the Rev'rend Artist did descry</L>
<L>Who nightly watch'd the Motions of the Sky,</L>
<L>Ye Gods (he cry'd) what does your rage prepare,</L>
<L>What unknown Plague engenders in the Air?</L>
<L>Besides, I see dire Wars on <HI>Europe</HI> shed,</L>

<L>To search the Book of destiny and show</L>
<L>What change shall rise in Heav'n or Earth below.</L>
<L>Behold him then in awfull Robes array'd,</L>

Old <HI>Saturn</HI> last with heavy pace comes on,</L>

<L>Thus, much distracted, and arriving late,</L>
<L>Sits grudging down beside the Chair of State.</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI> now unfolds what Fate's dark laws contain,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Jove</HI> alone has Wisedom to Explain:</L>

<L>Hell's Agent thus no sooner quits his Cage,</L>

The purer Orbs disdain th' Infernal foe,</L>

<L>The Offices of Nature to define,</L>

Besides the Power of Chance shall oft prevail,</L>

<L>Sometimes th' infected Air hurts Trees alone,</L>

<L>When Earth yields store, yet oft some strange Disease</L>
<L>Shall fall and onely on poor Cattel seize.</L>
<L>Here it shall sweep the Stock, while there it sheds</L>
<L>Its fury onely on devoted Heads.</L>
<L>My own Remembrance to this hour retains,</L>
<L>An Autumn drown'd with never ceasing Rains:</L>
<L>Yet this Malignant Luxury the breed</L>

Of this Contagion let us take a view,</L>
<L>More terrible for being Strange and new,</L>
<L>That with the proudest Son of Slaughter vies,</L>

<L>And as he did aloft conceive his Flame,</L>
<L>The proud Destroyer seeks no common Game,</L>
<L>He scorns the well finn'd Sporters of the Flood,</L>
<L>He scorns the well plum'd Singers of the wood;</L>
<L>Disdains the wanton Browzers of the Rock,</L>
<L>Disdains the lowing Herd and bleating Flock;</L>
<L>With Wolf or Bear, despizes to engage,</L>
<L>Nor can the generous Horse provoke his rage:</L>
<L>The Lords of Nature onely he annoys,</L>
<L>And humane frame, Heav'ns Images, destroys.</L>
<L>The bloud's black viscous parts he seizes first,</L>
<L>By whose malignant Aliments he's nurst;</L>
<L>And e'er he can the fierce Assault begin,</L>
<L>Factions of humours take his part within;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="275"/>
The strongest Holds of nature thus he gains,</L>
<L>Quar'tring his cruel Troops throughout the veins,</L>
<L>While some more noble Seat the Tyrant's Throne contains.</L>
<L>Such principles brought this Distemper forth,</L>
<L>Such Aliments maintain'd the dreadfull Birth.</L>
<L>His certain signs and symptoms to rehearse,</L>

<L><PB N="23" REF="275"/>
For thô th' infernal Pest should quit the Earth,</L>
<L>Absconding in the Hell, that gave it Birth;</L>
<L>Yet after lazy Revolutions past</L>
<L>The unsuspected Prodigy at last,</L>
<L>Shall from the womb of Night once more be hurl'd,</L>
<L>T' infect the Skies, and to amaze the World.</L>
<L>What therefore seems most wondrous in his course</L>
<L>Is that he should so long conceal his Force;</L>
<L>For when the Foe his secret way has made,</L>
<L>And in our Intrails strong detachments laid;</L>
<L>Yet oft the Moon four monthly rounds shall steer</L>
<L>Before convincing Symptoms shall appear;</L>
<L>So long the Malady shall lurk within,</L>

<L>Yet with Disturbance to the wretch diseas'd,</L>

The chearfull glories of his Eyes decay,</L>

<L>Till by degrees the Secret parts shall show,</L>

<L>Who now his dreadfull ensigns shall display,</L>

<L>Again, when chearfull Light has left the Skies,</L>

<L>When th'out works are no more of warmth possest,</L>

<L>Armes, Shoulders, Legs, with restless Arches vext,</L>

<L><PB N="25" REF="276"/>
For when through all our Veins th' Infection's spread,</L>
<L>And by what e'er should feed the Body fed;</L>
<L>When Nature strives the Vitals to defend,</L>
<L>And all destructive humours outward send:</L>
<L>These being viscous, gross and loath to start,</L>
<L>In its dull March shall torture ev'ry Part;</L>
<L>Whence to the Bloudless Nerves dire Pains ensue,</L>
<L>At once contracted, and extended too;</L>
<L>The thinner Parts will yet not stick so fast,</L>
<L>But to the Surface of the Skin are cast,</L>
<L>Which in foul Botches o'er the Body spread,</L>
<L>Prophane the Bosome, and deform the Head:</L>

<L>Whose Ripness is Corruption, that in time,</L>
<L>Disdain confinement, and discharge the slime;</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="277"/>
Yet oft the Foe would turn his Forces back,</L>
<L>The Brawn and inmost Muscles to attack,</L>
<L>And pierce so deep, that the bare Bones have been</L>
<L>Betwixt the dreadfull fleshy Breaches seen;</L>
<L>When on the vocal parts his Rage was spent,</L>
<L>Imperfect sounds, for tunefull Speech was sent.</L>
<L>As on a springing Plant, you have beheld</L>
<L>The juice that through the tender Bark has swell'd,</L>

<L>That we the fair <HI>Hesperian</HI> Gardens found,</L>

<L>While Ships for Camels the rich Lading brought:</L>

<L>Our fam'd Adventures on the western Shore,</L>

<L>An inspir'd Poet, and by none excell'd,</L>

<L><HI>Sebethe</HI>'s God, and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s sacred Shade,</L>

From Gardens to the Stars his Muse would rise,</L>
<L>And made the Earth acquainted with the Skies.</L>
<L>His Name might well the Ages pride sustain,</L>
<L>But many more exalted Souls remain;</L>
<L>Who, when Expir'd, and Envy with them dead</L>
<L>To equal the best Ancients shall be said:</L>
<L>But, <HI>Bembus,</HI> while this List we do unfold,</L>

<L><HI>Leo,</HI> the most illustrious place do's claim,</L>
<L>The great Restorer of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name;</L>

<L>Malignant Planets to their Cells retire.</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI>'s friendly Star once more is seen to rise</L>

<L>He, onely He, our Losses could repair,</L>

<L>Polish Religion, from Barbarian Rust.</L>

For Heav'n, and <HI>Rome</HI> engag'd in fierce Alarms,</L>
<L>With pious Vengeance, and with sacred Arms,</L>
<L>Whose terrour to <HI>Euphrates</HI> Banks was spread,</L>
<L>While <HI>Nile</HI> retir'd t'his undiscover'd Head,</L>
<L>And frighted <HI>Doris</HI> div'd into hisoozy Bed.</L>
<L>While some more able Muse shall fing his Name,</L>
<L>In Numbers equal to his Deeds and Fame.</L>
<L>While <HI>Bembus</HI> thou shalt this great Theme rehearse,</L>
<L>And weave his Praises in eternal Verse,</L>
<L>Let me, in what I have propos'd, proceed</L>
<L>With Subject suted to my slender Reed.</L>
<L>First, then your Patient's Constitution learn,</L>
<L>And well the Temper of his Bloud discern,</L>
<L>If that be pure, with so much greater ease</L>
<L>You will engage, and vanquish the Disease,</L>
<L>Whose venome, where black Choler choaks the Veins,</L>
<L>Takes firmer hold, and will exact more Pains</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="283"/>
More violent Assaults you there must make,</L>
<L>And on the batter'd Frame no pity take.</L>
<L>Who e'er can soon discern the lurking Grief,</L>
<L>With far less labour may expect Relief;</L>
<L>But when the Foe has deeper inroads made,</L>
<L>And gain'd the factious humours to his Aid,</L>
<L>What Toil, what Conflicts must be first sustain'd</L>
<L>Before he's dispossest, and Health regain'd;</L>
<L>Therefore with Care his first approaches find,</L>
<L>And hoard these usefull Precepts in thy Mind.</L>
<L>From noxious Winds preserve your self with care,</L>
<L>And such are all that from the South repair</L>
<L>Of Fens and Lakes, avoid th'unwholsome Air.</L>
<L>To open fields and sunny Mountains fly</L>
<L>Where <HI>Zephyr</HI> fans, and <HI>Boreas</HI> sweeps the Sky:</L>
<L>Nor must you there indulge Repose, but stray,</L>
<L>And in continu'd actions spend the Day;</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="284"/>
With ev'ry Beast of Prey loud Warproclaim,</L>
<L>And make the grizly Boar your constant Game,</L>
<L>Nor yet amongst these great Attempts disdain,</L>
<L>To rouse the Stag, and force him to the Plain.</L>
<L>Some I have known to th'Chase so much inclin'd,</L>
<L>That in the Woods they left their Grief behind,</L>
<L>Nor yet think fcorn the sordid Plow to guide,</L>
<L>Or with the pondrous Rake the Clods divide,</L>
<L>With heavy Ax, and many weary blow,</L>
<L>The towring Pine, and spreading Oak o'erthrow;</L>
<L>The very House yields Exercise, the Hall</L>
<L>Has room for Fencing, and the bounding Ball.</L>
<L>Rouze, rouze, shake off your fond desire of Ease,</L>
<L>For Sleep foments and feeds the foul Disease,</L>
<L>'Tis then th'Invader do's the Vitals seize.</L>
<L>But chiefly from thy Thoughts all sorrows drive.</L>
<L>Nor with <HI>Minerva</HI>'s knotty Precepts strive,</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="284"/>
With lighter Labours of the Muses sport,</L>
<L>And seek the Plains where Swains and Nymphs resort.</L>
<L>Abstain however from the Act of Love,</L>
<L>For nothing can so much destructive prove:</L>
<L>Bright <HI>Venus</HI> hates polluted Mysteries,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Nymph from foul Embraces flies.</L>
<L>Dire practice! Poison with Delight to bring,</L>
<L>And with the Lovers Dart, the Serpent's sting.</L>
<L>A proper Diet you must next prepare,</L>
<L>Than which there's nothing more requires your care;</L>
<L>All Food that from the Fens is brought resuse,</L>
<L>Whate'er the standing Lakes or Seas produce,</L>
<L>Nor must long Custome pass for an Excuse;</L>
<L>Therefore from Fish in general I dissuade,</L>
<L>All these are of a washy Substance made,</L>
<L>Which though the luscious Palate they content,</L>
<L>Convert to Humours more than Nourishment;</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="285"/>
Ev'n Giltheads, though most tempting to the sight,</L>
<L>And sharp-fin'd Perch that in the Rocks delight.</L>
<L>All sorts of Fowl that on the Water prey,</L>
<L>By the same Rule I'd have remov'd away,</L>
<L>Forbear the Drake, and leave <HI>Rome</HI>'s ancient Friend</L>
<L>The Capitol and City to Defend.</L>
<L>No less the Bustard's luscious Flesh decline,</L>
<L>Forbear the Back and Entrails of the Swine,</L>
<L>Nor with the hunted Boar thy Hunger stay,</L>
<L>Enjoy the Sport, but still forbear the Prey.</L>
<L>I hold nor Cucumber nor Mushroms good,</L>
<L>And Artichoke is too salacious Food:</L>
<L>Nor yet the use of Milk would I enjoin,</L>
<L>Much less of Vinegar or eager Wine,</L>
<L>Such as from <HI>Rhaetia</HI> comes, and from the <HI>Rhine;</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Sabine</HI> Vintage is of safer Use,</L>
<L>Which mellow and Well-water'd fields produce:</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="285"/>
But if your Banquets with the Gods you'd make</L>
<L>Of Herbs and Roots the unbought Dainties take;</L>
<L>Be fure that Mint and Endive still abound,</L>
<L>And Sowthistle, with leaves in Winter crown'd.</L>
<L>And <HI>Sian</HI> by clear Fountains always found;</L>
<L>To these add Calamint, and Savery</L>
<L>Burrage and Balm, whose mingled sweets agree,</L>
<L>Rochet and Sorrel I as much approve:</L>
<L>The climbing Hop grows wild in ev'ry Grove,</L>
<L>Take thence the infant Buds, and with them join</L>
<L>The curling Tendrells of the springing Vine,</L>
<L>Whose Armes have yet no friendly shade allow'd,</L>
<L>Nor with the weight of juicy Clusters bow'd.</L>
<L>Particulars were endless to rehearse,</L>
<L>And weightier Subjects now demand our Verse.</L>
<L>We'll draw the Muses from <HI>Aonian</HI> Hills,</L>
<L>To Natures Garden, Groves and humble Rills,</L>

Where if no Laurels spring, or if I find</L>
<L>That those are all for Conquerours design'd;</L>
<L>With Oaken Leaves at least I'll bind my Brow,</L>
<L>For millions sav'd you must that Grace allow.</L>
<L>At first approach of Spring, I would advise,</L>
<L>Or ev'n in Autumn months if strength suffice,</L>
<L>To bleed your Patient in the regal Vein,</L>
<L>And by degrees th' infected Current drein:</L>
<L>But in all Seasons fail not to expell,</L>
<L>And purge the noxious Humours from their Cell;</L>
<L>But fit Ingredients you must first collect,</L>
<L>And then their different Qualities respect,</L>
<L>Make firm the Liquid and the Gross dissect.</L>
<L>Take, therefore, care to gather, in their prime,</L>
<L>The sweet Corycian and Pamphilian Tyme,</L>
<L>These you must boil, together with the Rest</L>
<L>In this ensuing Catalogue exprest;</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="286"/>
Fennell and Hop that close Embraces weaves,</L>
<L>Parsley and Fumitory's bitter Leaves;</L>
<L>Wild Fern on ev'ry Down and Heath you'll meet</L>
<L>With Leaves resembling <HI>Polypus</HI>'s shagg'd feet,</L>
<L>And Mayden-hair, of virtue strange, but true</L>
<L>For dipt in Fountains, it reteins no Dew:</L>
<L>Hart's-tongue and Citarch must be added too.</L>
<L>The greater Part, and with success more sure,</L>
<L>By Mercury perform the happy Cure;</L>
<L>A wondrous virtue in that Mineral lies,</L>
<L>Whether by force of various Qualities</L>
<L>Of Cold and Heat, it flies into the Veins,</L>
<L>And with a fiercer Fire their Flame restrains,</L>
<L>Conqu'ring the raging Humours in their Seat,</L>
<L>As glowing Steel exceeds the Forge's heat,</L>
<L>Or whether his keen Particles (combin'd</L>

Disperse, all Quarters of the Foe to seize,</L>
<L>And burn the very Seeds of the Disease;</L>
<L>Or whether 'tis with some more hidden force</L>
<L>Endow'd by Nature to perform its Course,</L>
<L>Is hard to say, but though the Gods conceal</L>
<L>The virtual Cause, they did its use reveal.</L>
<L>Now by what means 'twas found our Song shall shew,</L>
<L>Nor may we let Heav'ns Gifts in Silence go.</L>
<L>In <HI>Syrian</HI> Vales where Groves of Osier grow,</L>
<L>And where <HI>Callirrhoe's</HI> sacred Fountains flow.</L>
<L><HI>Ilceus</HI> the Huntsman, who with Zeal ador'd</L>
<L>The rural Gods, with Gifts their Altars stor'd;</L>
<L>Was yet afflicted with this restless Grief,</L>
<L>And, if Tradition may obtain belief,</L>
<L>As he was watering there each spicy Bed,</L>
<L>Thus to entreat the <HI>Sylvan</HI> Pow'rs, is said.</L>
<L>You Deities by me ador'd, and Thou,</L>
<L><HI>Callirrhoe,</HI> who do'st Relief allow</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="287"/>
'Gainst all Diseases, as I slew for. Thee</L>
<L>The Stag, and fix'd his Head upon a Tree;</L>
<L>A Tree that do's with lesser Branches spread,</L>
<L>Than those that join to that most horrid Head:</L>
<L>You sacred Pow'rs if you'll remove away</L>
<L>This plague that Racks my Frame all Night and Day,</L>
<L>I, all the mingled glories of the Spring,</L>
<L>Lilies and Violets to your Seats will bring,</L>
<L>With Daffadills first budding Roses weave,</L>
<L>And on your Shrines the fragrant Garland leave.</L>
<L>He said, and down upon the Herbage lay,</L>
<L>Tir'd with the raging Pain, and raging Day.</L>
<L><HI>Callirrhoe</HI> (bathing in the neighbouring Well,</L>
<L>With Musk that grew in Plenty round the Cell)</L>
<L>Heard the Youth's pray'r and streight in soft repose,</L>
<L>Th'indulgent Nymph his heavy Eyes did close,</L>
<L>Then to his Fancy, from her sacred Streams,</L>
<L>Appear'd and charm'd him with prophetick Dreams.</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="288"/>
<HI>Ilceus</HI> (said she) my Servant, and my Care,</L>
<L>The Gods at last have hearken'd to thy Pray'r;</L>
<L>Yet, on the Earth, as far as <HI>Sol</HI> can spy,</L>
<L>For thy Disease remains no Remedy.</L>
<L><HI>Cynthia</HI> and <HI>Phoebus</HI> too at her Request,</L>
<L>Into thy tortur'd Veins have sent this Pest,</L>
<L>The Stag to her was sacred which you slew,</L>
<L>And this the Punishment that did ensue,</L>
<L>For which the Earth, as far as <HI>Sol</HI> can see,</L>
<L>The spacious Earth, affords no Remedy:</L>
<L>Then since her Surface no relief canlend,</L>
<L>To her dark Entrails for thy Cure descend;</L>
<L>A Cave there is its self an awfull shade,</L>
<L>But by <HI>Jove</HI>'s spreading Tree more dreadfull made,</L>
<L>Where mingling Cedars wanton with the Air,</L>
<L>Thither at first approach of Day repair;</L>
<L>A jet-black Ram before the Entrance slay,</L>
<L>And cry, these Rites great <HI>Ops</HI> to Thee I pay.</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="288"/>
The lesser Pow'rs, pale Ghosts and Nymphs of Night,</L>
<L>The Smoak of Yew and Cypress shall invite;</L>
<L>These Nymphs shall at the outmost Entrance stay,</L>
<L>And through the dark Retreats conduct thy way.</L>
<L>Rise, rise, nor think all this an idle Dream,</L>
<L>For know I am the Goddess of this Stream.</L>
<L>This for thy pious Homage to my Cell—</L>
<L>So spake the Nymph, and div'd into the Well.</L>
<L>The Youth starts up astonish'd, but restor'd,</L>
<L>With gratefull pray'rs th'obliging Nymph ador'd:</L>
<L>Thy Voice, bright Goddess, I'll with speed Obey,</L>
<L>O still assist and bless me on my Way.</L>
<L>With the next Dawn the sacred Cave he found,</L>
<L>With spreading Oaks and towring Cedars crown'd;</L>
<L>A jet-black Ram did at the Entrance slay,</L>
<L>And cry'd these Rites, great <HI>Ops,</HI> to thee I pay:</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="289"/>
The lesser Pow'rs, pale Ghosts and Nymphs of Night,</L>
<L>The Smoak of Yew and Cypress did invite.</L>
<L>His Voice resounding through the hollow Seats,</L>
<L>Disturb'd the Nymphs within their deep Retreats.</L>
<L>Those Nymphs that toil in Metals underground,</L>
<L>Gave o'er their Work at th' unexpected Sound;</L>
<L>Some Quicksilver and Sulphur others brought,</L>
<L>From which calcin'd, the golden Oar was wrought;</L>
<L>Of pure AEtherial Light a hundred beams,</L>
<L>Of Subterranean fire a hundred Streams,</L>
<L>With various seeds of Earth and Sea they joyn'd,</L>
<L>For humane Eyes too subtle and refin'd.</L>
<L>But <HI>Lipare</HI> who forms the richer Oar,</L>
<L>And to the Furnace brings the Sulph'rous store,</L>
<L>To <HI>Ilceus</HI> through the dark Recesses broke,</L>
<L>And in these words the trembling Youth bespoke.</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="289"/>
<HI>Ilceus</HI> (for I have heard your Name and Grief)</L>
<L><HI>Callirrhoe</HI> sends you hither for relief;</L>
<L>Nor has the Goddess counsell'd you in vain,</L>
<L>These Cells afford a Med'cine for your Pain;</L>
<L>Take courage therefore, and the Charge obey,</L>
<L>She said, and through the Cavern leads the way</L>
<L>He follows wondring at the dark aboads,</L>
<L>The spacious Voids and Subterranean Roads;</L>
<L>Astonisht there to see those Rivers move,</L>
<L>Which he observ'd to lose themselves above:</L>
<L>Each Cave, cry'd <HI>Lipare,</HI> some Pow'r contains,</L>
<L>I'th lowest Mansion <HI>Proserpine</HI> remains;</L>
<L>The middle Regions <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Treasure hold,</L>
<L>And Nymphs that work in Silver, Brass and Gold,</L>
<L>Of which rich Train am I, whose Veins extend,</L>
<L>And to <HI>Callirrhoe</HI>'s Stream the smoaking Sulphur send.</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="290"/>
Thus through the Realms of Night they took their way,</L>
<L>And heard from far the Forge and Furnace play.</L>
<L>These (said the Nymph) the Beds of Metals are,</L>
<L>That give you wretched Mortals so much Care.</L>
<L>By thousand Nymphs of Earth and Night enjoy'd,</L>
<L>Who yet in various Tasks are all employ'd.</L>
<L>Some turn the Current, some the Seeds dissect</L>
<L>Of Earth and Sea, which some again collect,</L>
<L>That, mixt with Lightning, make the golden Oar,</L>
<L>While others quench in Streams the shining store.</L>
<L>Not far from hence the <HI>Cyclop's</HI> Cave is found,</L>
<L>See how it glows, hark how their Anvils sound.</L>
<L>But here turn off, and take the right-hand way,</L>
<L>This Path do's to that sacred Stream convey,</L>
<L>In which thy onely Hope remains: She said,</L>
<L>And under golden Roofs her Patient led,</L>

Hard by, the Lakes of liquid Silver slow'd,</L>
<L>Which to the wondring Youth the Goddess show'd;</L>
<L>Thrice washt in these (said she) thy Pains shall end,</L>
<L>And all the Stench into the Stream descend.</L>
<L>Thrice with her Virgin hands the Goddess threw</L>
<L>On all his suffering Limbs the healing Dew:</L>
<L>He, at the falling Filth admiring stood,</L>
<L>And scarce believ'd for joy, the virtue of the Flood.</L>
<L>When therefore you return to open Day,</L>
<L>With Sacrifice <HI>Diana</HI>'s Rage allay,</L>
<L>And Homage to the Fountain's Goddess pay.</L>
<L>Thus spake the Nymph, and through the Realms of Night,</L>
<L>Restor'd the gratefull Youth to open Light.</L>
<L>This strange Invention soon obtain'd belief,</L>
<L>And flying Fame divulg'd the sure Relief.</L>
<L>But first Experiments did onely joyn,</L>
<L>And for a Vehicle use lard of Swine:</L>

Larch-gum and Turpentine were added next,</L>

<L>Horse-grease and Bears with them they did com∣pound,</L>
<L>Bdellium and Gum of Cedar usefull found;</L>
<L>Then Myrrh, and Frankincense were us'd by some,</L>
<L>With living Sulphur and <HI>Arabian</HI> Gum;</L>
<L>But if black Helebore be added too,</L>
<L>With Rain-bow Flowers your Method I allow;</L>
<L>Benzoin and Galbanum I next require,</L>
<L>Lint-Oil, and Sulphur's e'er it feels the Fire.</L>
<L>With these Ingredients mix'd, you must not fear</L>
<L>Your suffering Limbs and Body to besmear,</L>
<L>Nor let the foulness of the Course displease,</L>
<L>Obscene indeed, but less than your Disease:</L>
<L>Yet when you do anoint, take special care</L>
<L>That both your Head and tender Breast you spare</L>
<L>This done, wrapt close and swath'd, repair to Bed,</L>

What God did first the wondrous use display,</L>
<L>Of this blest Plant, what chance did first convey</L>
<L>Our <HI>European</HI> Fleet to that rich shore,</L>
<L>That for their Toil so rich a Traffique bore,</L>

<L>For no known Port nor yet discover'd Ground,</L>
<L>Resolv'd the secrets of the Main to find,</L>
<L>And now they leave their Native shore behind,</L>
<L>Clap on more Sail and skudd before the Wind.</L>
<L>Thus on the spreading Ocean they did stray,</L>
<L>For many Weeks uncertain of their way:</L>
<L>The thronging Sea-Nymphs wondring at the Pride,</L>

'Twas night, but <HI>Cynthia</HI> did such beams display.</L>
<L>So strong as more than half restor'd the Day.</L>
<L>When the bold Leader of this roving Train,</L>
<L>(The bravest Youth that ever stemm'd the Main;)</L>
<L>As on the Decks he lay with anxious care,</L>

<L>Bright Goddess of the night (said he) whose sway,</L>

<L>Twice have we seen thy infant <HI>Crescents</HI> spring,</L>
<L>And twice united in a glorious Ring,</L>
<L>Since first this Fleet commenc'd her restless toil,</L>

<L>O Virgin Star, of nightly Planets chief,</L>

The Goddess heard not this Address in Vain,</L>
<L>But leaves to her nocturnal Steeds the Rein,</L>

<L>With such a meen she cut the yielding Tide,</L>

Like clouds at first, but as they nearer drew,</L>
<L>Rocks, Groves and Springs were open'd to their View;</L>
<L>High on the Decks the joyfull Sailers stand,</L>
<L>And thrice with Shouts salute th' expected Land.</L>
<L>Then safely Anchor'd in the promis'd Bay,</L>

<L>Four days, no more, are spent upon this Soil,</L>

<L>Is that dire Curse which <HI>Phoebus</HI> did relate;</L>
<L>The Birds prodigious Song I now recall,</L>
<L>The strange Disease that on our Troops shou'd fall.</L>

<L>To what dread Power these Off'rings did belong?</L>
<L>What meant that languishing infected Throng?</L>
<L>And why the Shepherd by the Altar stood?</L>
<L>And wherefore Sprinkled with the gushing bloud?</L>

<L>If you have any Sense of Strangers fate,</L>
<L>From its first source the Story I'll relate:</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="301"/>
Perhaps you may have heard of <HI>Atlas</HI> name,</L>
<L>From whom in long descent great Nations came;</L>
<L>From him we sprang, and once a happy Race,</L>
<L>Belov'd of Heav'n while Piety had place,</L>
<L>While to the Gods our Ancestours did Pray,</L>
<L>And gratefull Off'rings on their Altars lay.</L>
<L>But when the Powers to be despis'd began,</L>
<L>When to leud Luxury our Nation ran;</L>
<L>Who can express the Mis'ries that ensu'd,</L>
<L>And Plagues with each returning Day renew'd?</L>
<L>Then fair <HI>Atlantia</HI> once an Isle of fame;</L>
<L>(That from the mighty <HI>Atlas</HI> took its Name,</L>
<L>Who there had govern'd long with upright Sway)</L>
<L>Was gorg'd intire, and swallowed by the Sea.</L>
<L>With which our Flocks and Herds were wholly drown'd,</L>
<L>Not one preserv'd or ever after found.</L>
<L>Since when outlandish Cattle here are slain,</L>
<L>And Bulls of foreign Breed our Altars stain;</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="301"/>
In that dire Season this Disease was bred,</L>
<L>That thus o'er all our tortur'd Limbs is spread:</L>
<L>Most universal from it Birth it grew,</L>
<L>And none have since escap'd or very few;</L>
<L>Sent from above to scourge that vicious Age,</L>
<L>And chiefly by incens'd <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Rage,</L>
<L>For which these annual Rites were first ordain'd,</L>
<L>Whereof this firm Tradition is retain'd.</L>
<L>A Shepherd once (distrust not ancient Fame)</L>
<L>Possest these Downs, and <HI>Syphilus</HI> his Name.</L>
<L>A thousand Heifers in these Vales he fed,</L>
<L>A thousand Ews to those fair Rivers led:</L>
<L>For King <HI>Alcithous</HI> he rais'd this Stock,</L>
<L>And shaded in the Covert of a Rock,</L>
<L>For now 'twas <HI>Solstice,</HI> and the <HI>Syrian</HI> Star</L>
<L>Increast the Heat and shot his Beams afar;</L>
<L>The Fields were burnt to ashes, and the Swain</L>

<L>No nightly Dew refresht the thirsty Ground:</L>
<L>This Drought our <HI>Syphilus</HI> beheld with pain,</L>
<L>Nor could the suff'rings of his Flock sustain,</L>
<L>But to the Noon-day Sun with up-cast Eyes,</L>
<L>In rage threw these reproaching Blasphemies,</L>
<L>Is it for this O <HI>Sol,</HI> that thou art styl'd</L>
<L>Our God and Parent? how are we beguil'd</L>
<L>Dull Bigots to pay Hom'age to thy Name?</L>

<L>Why do we yearly Rites for thee prepare,</L>
<L>Who tak'st of our affairs so little Care?</L>
<L>At least thou might'st between the Rabble Kine</L>
<L>Distinguish, and these royal Herds of Mine.</L>
<L>These to the great <HI>Alcithous</HI> belong,</L>

<L>A thousand Heifers of the snowy Breed,</L>
<L>A thousand Ews of mine these Downs didfeed;</L>
<L>Whilst one Etherial Bull was all your stock,</L>
<L>One Ram, and to preserve this mighty Flock,</L>
<L>You must forsooth your <HI>Syrian</HI> Dog maintain,</L>
<L>Why do I worship then a Pow'r so Vain?</L>
<L>Henceforth I to <HI>Alcithous</HI> will bring</L>
<L>My Off'rings and Adore my greater King,</L>
<L>Who do's such spacious Tracts of Land possess,</L>
<L>And whose vast Pow'r the conquer'd Seas confess.</L>
<L>Him I'll invoke my Suff'rings to redress.</L>
<L>Hee'll streight command the cooling Winds to blow,</L>
<L>Refreshing Show'rs on Trees and Herbs bestow,</L>
<L>Nor suffer Thirst, both Flock and Swain to kill:</L>

<L>Erects an Altar to his Monarch's name,</L>

At length to greater Victims they proceed,</L>
<L>Till Swine and Heifers too by hundreds Bleed,</L>

<L>Commands all Altars else to be destroy'd,</L>

<L>The onely and sufficient Deity;</L>
<L>That Heav'nly Pow'rs liv'd too remote and high,</L>
<L>And had enough to do to Rule the Sky.</L>
<L>Th' all-seeing Sun no longer could sustain</L>
<L>These practices, but with enrag'd Disdain</L>
<L>Darts forth such pestilent malignant Beams,</L>

'Tis sacred Truth—</L>
<L>These Groves that spread so wide and look so green</L>

<L>Commands them in his stead a Heifer slay,</L>

<L>This made our gratefull Ancestours enjoin,</L>
