<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Finde (gentle Reader) in Hi∣stories
commended vnto vs▪
the painfull trauels of some
(both by Sea and by Land)
which visited farre countries,
that they might bee made
more wise and learned. For
this purpose <HI>Pythagoras</HI> tra∣uelled
into <HI>Egypt</HI> to heare the
M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>phiticall Poets. plato leauing <HI>Athens,</HI> where hee
taught with great commendation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into <HI>Italy</HI> to
<HI>Archit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arentum,</HI> that he might learne somewhat of
that Philosopher and Disciple of <HI>Pythag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as.) Apollonius</HI>
(with no lesse labour than danger and cost) passed and
iourneied to the furthest par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Philoso∣phers
there, that he might heare <HI>Hierarchs,</HI> sitting in a
throne of gold, and drinking of the Well of <HI>Tantalus,</HI>
disputing amongst a few Schollars, of Nature, of Man∣ners,
of the course of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Statres▪ from thence,
returning by the <HI>Elamites, Babylonians, Chalda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, Medes,
Assyrians, Palestines;</HI> he came to <HI>Alexandria:</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> that he might see the Philosophers
in <HI>India,</HI> which went alwaies naked, and the Table of the
<PB REF="3"/>
Sunne, which was famous throughout the world. <HI>Solon</HI>
went from <HI>Graecia</HI> to <HI>Egypt</HI> for a like purpose. All these
trauelled to get wisdome and learning.</P>
<P>It is written of <HI>Hierome,</HI> that he went from <HI>Dalmatia</HI>
to <HI>Rome;</HI> from thence to <HI>Germanie;</HI> then to <HI>Constantino∣ple;</HI>
then to <HI>Alexandria;</HI> then to <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> onely to see
and heare famous men, that he might alwaies goe for∣ward
in wisdome.</P>
<P><HI>Iacob</HI> in his old age trauelled into <HI>Egypt,</HI> partly con∣strained
by necessity, and partly for loue of <HI>Ioseph.</HI> The
Queène of the South, a woman (whom <HI>Aristotle</HI> calleth
imperfect creatures) trauelled farre to heare the wisdom
of <HI>Sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mon.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst vs there haue beene (and are still) sundrie
Trauellers of great name, which haue enterprised and
taken in hand great Voyages, and dangerous iournies;
Some to <HI>Venice,</HI> some to <HI>Rome,</HI> some to <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
some to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> some to <HI>Syria,</HI> some to <HI>Persia,</HI> some to
the <HI>Turke,</HI> some to the <HI>Barbarians:</HI> And these haue tra∣uelled
vpon diuers respects: Some for pleasure, some for
profit, some to see their manners, some to learne their
languages, some to get experience, some to get wisdome
and knowledge; not sparing any cost, fearing any dan∣ger,
nor refusing any paines. Others would trauell, but
are loth to be at any charges. Others would bee at the
cost, but feare to expose themselues to dangers by Sea
and by Land. It is good (say they) to sleepe in a whole
skinne. They cannot abide to bee tossed and tumbled
like tennis-bals on the turbulent and tempestuous seas,
as <HI>Ouid</HI> in his exile complained he was, when hee said,
<HI>Eleg.</HI> 2.</P>
<Q><PB REF="3"/>
<L>Me miserum, quanti montes voluuntur aquarum,</L>
<L>Iamiam tacturos <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idera summa putes.</L>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amiam tacturas Tartara nigra putes.</L></Q>
<P>That is,</P>
<Q><L>What boisterous billowes now (O wretch!)</L>
<L>Amidst the waues we spie,</L>
<L>As I foorthwith should haue beene heau'd</L>
<L>To touch the Azure skie?</L>
<L>What vacant vallies be there set</L>
<L>In swallowing Seas so wrought,</L>
<L>As presently thou look'st I should</L>
<L>To drery hell be brought?</L></Q>
<P><HI>Aeneas</HI> was tossed with a like tempest, as <HI>Virgil</HI> finely
describeth it, <HI>Aeneid.</HI> 1. which place is well knowen to
all yoong scholars. And these fresh water souldiers dis∣courage
themselues from trauell, and say, It was one of
the three things which <HI>Cato</HI> repented, to trauell by Sea
when hee might haue gone by Land: And a charge
that <HI>Antigonus</HI> gaue his sonnes (when they were tossed
with a tempest) <HI>Remember (my sonnes) and warne your po∣sterity
of it, that they neuer hazard themselues vpon such ad∣uentures.</HI>
For Sailers and Aduenturers (as one saith very
well) are neither amongst the liuing, nor amongst the
dead: they hang betweene both, ready to offer vp their
soules to euery flaw of wind and billow of water where∣with
they are assaulted, especially to euery stormy wind,
and huge sea. And it is more safe (say they) to stand vp∣on
<PB REF="4"/>
the shoare, and to see the raging of the waters from
the sea bankes, than to be tossed thereupon, and endan∣gered
thereby.</P>
<P>Wherefore (albeit I be no great traueller my selfe)
yet to set foorth the praise of the one, who haue beene
at the cost, hazarded the danger, and returned with cre∣dit;
and to helpe the pusillanimitie of others who feare
to vndertake the trauell in regard of the danger; and to
releeue the miserie of others, who are loth to bee at the
cost though they delight to heare and see strange coun∣tries,
people, and manners: I haue thought good to
publish the trauels of others, which lately (by good
chance) is come vnto my hands, after the death of Ma∣ster
<HI>Bezaliell Biddulph</HI> a learned and religious gentleman,
to whom they were first written. In whose study (a∣mongst
his letters and loose papers) was found first of all
a Copy of a voyage to <HI>Ierusalem</HI> by Land, from <HI>Aleppo</HI>
in <HI>Syria Comagena,</HI> not long since vndertaken and per∣formed
by fiue Englishmen there soiourning, viz Ma∣ster
<HI>William Biddulph</HI> (Preacher to the Company of En∣glish
Merchants resident in <HI>Aleppo</HI>) Master <HI>Ieffrey Kirbie</HI>
Merchant, Master <HI>Edward Abbot</HI> Merchant, Master <HI>Iohn
Elkin</HI> gentleman, and <HI>Iasper Tyon</HI> Ieweller.</P>
<P>This vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age was well penned, and generally well li∣ked
of all that saw it, who craued copies thereof, by
which meanes at length it came to my hands: which I
thorowly perusing; and finding therein mention made
of former Letters, concerning other voyages by one of
these fiue trauellers formerly performed, directed to the
said Gentleman <HI>Bezaliel Biddulph:</HI> I could not satisfie my
selfe vntill (by the meanes of friends) I came to the sight
of the rest also, which were many in number, at least
<PB REF="4"/>
twenty letters, besides the voyage to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> all dire∣cted
vnto one man: Some by the Preacher aboue na∣med,
maister <HI>William Biddulph:</HI> and some by his brother
<HI>Peter Biddulph</HI> Lapidarie and Diamond cutter in those
Countries. Out of all which Letters I haue gathered the
matter therein contained, (leauing out onely some salu∣tations
and priuate matters) and haue thought good (for
the helpe of Trauellers and delight of others) to make
one body of them, and (without the consent of either of
them) to put them in print. For the one of these two bre∣thren
is yet beyond the Seas; the other (after ten yeeres
trauell) is lately arriued into England, and hath sundrie
times beene requested (by diuers of his good friends) to
publish his trauels, but he could neuer be perswaded so
to doe, but answered▪ that he knew how to spend his time
better, and that he was not ignorant of the incredulitie
of others in such cases, who wil hardly beleeue any thing
but that which they themselues haue seene; and when
they heare any thing that seemeth strange vnto them,
they reply, that trauellers may lie by authority: but they
are liers themselues which say so; for trauellers haue no
more authority to lie than others, neither will they arro∣gate
vnto themselues more liberty to lie than others, e∣specially
being men that feare God, as they (of all others)
should be, who goe downe to the Sea in ships, and see
the workes of the Lord both by Sea and by Land, and
his wonders in the deepe.</P>
<P>In regard whereof, hee hath beene so farre from prin∣ting
his trauels, that he (being a very modest man) taketh
no delight to speake thereof, except it be vnto some fa∣miliar
friend. But for that old acquaintance which I
haue had with him (hauing beene his schollar) and that
<PB REF="5"/>
mutuall loue betwixt vs of long continuance; I was so
bold to make knowen vnto him, that I had seene all the
letters which both he and his brother <HI>Peter Biddulph</HI> had
written to their friend <HI>Bezaliel Biddulph,</HI> (wherein they
discoursed of all their trauels) and what paines I had ta∣ken
to gather them together for mine owne delight, and
direction in my trauels, which I purposed shortly to vn∣dertake.
Whereupon he requested mee to keepe them
secret to my selfe, which I told him I had done, foras∣much
as I had read in one of his letters to M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Bezaliel
Biddulph,</HI> the like request, which hee made vnto him in
these words: <HI>I pray you keepe my Letters to your selfe, lest
whiles to giue content vnto you in writing what you would, I
receiue discontent my selfe in hearing what I would not.</HI></P>
<P>Heereby I found him very affable, and willing to
conferre with me of his trauels, and to giue me direction
for mine, and to resolue me in any thing I desired, con∣cealing
my purpose of imprinting them, when (by con∣ference
with him and other trauellers into those parts)
I had perfected them. Yet, forasmuch as a publike good
is to be preferred before a priuate, I could not but im∣part
vnto others that which I my selfe had learned of o∣thers:
For that which <HI>Persius</HI> speaketh interrogatiuely,
in this case I vnderstand positiuely:</P>
<Q>Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter:</Q>
<P>That is,</P>
<Q><L>It is nothing for thee a good thing to know,</L>
<L>Vnlesse thou impart it toothers also.</L></Q>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
And who knoweth what good may redounde vnto o∣thers,
by reading of this discourse of other Countries?
For hereby all men may see how God hath blessed our
Countrie aboue others, and be stirred vp to thankeful∣nesse.</P>
<P>Hereby subiects may learne to loue, honour, and obey
their good and gratious King, when they shall reade of
the tyrannous gouernement of other Countries, and of
the mercifull gouernement of theirs.</P>
<P>Heereby hearers may learne to loue and reuerence
their Pastors, and to thank God for the inestimable bene∣fit
of the preaching of the word amongst them; when
they shall reade in what blindnesse and palpable igno∣rance
other nations liue, not knowing the right hand
from the left in matters that concerne the kingdome of
Heauen, and yet reuerence and honour their blind guids
and superstitious Church-men like Angels, and prouide
for their maintenance roially.</P>
<P>Heere wiues may learne to loue their husbands, when
they shal read in what slauery women liue in other Con∣tries,
and in what awe and subiection to their husbands,
and what libertie and freedome they themselues enioy.</P>
<P>Heereby seruants may bee taught to be faithfull and
dutifull to their Masters, when they shall read of the
brutish and barbarous immanitie in other Countries of
masters towards their seruants; who not only beat them
like dogs, but sell them at their pleasure, and sometimes
kill them for small offences.</P>
<P>Heere rich men may learne to be thankefull to God,
not onely for their libertie and freedome of their Con∣science
and persons; but of their goods also: when they
shall read, how in other contries no man is master of his
<PB REF="6"/>
owne, but as the fattest oxe is neerest vnto the slaughter,
so the richest men are neerest vnto death.</P>
<P>Here poore men may learne to be thankefull to God
for their benefactors, and not to be repining and impa∣tient
beggers (as many of them are) when they shal read
how in other countries the poore liue like brute beastes,
on grasse and water, the rich hauing no more mercie on
them, then the rich glutton had of <HI>Lazarus.</HI></P>
<P>Heere they that trauell in England may learne what a
benefit it is to haue the refuge of Innes in their trauell,
and bee content to pay well for it, where they are well v∣sed:
wheras in other countries they lodge without dores
all night and carie their prouision with them.</P>
<P>And the publishing hereof without the Authors con∣sent
may perhaps bee an inducement vnto him to en∣large
this discourse, by adding thereunto the diuersities
of Religions in those countries, and what conference and
disputation he hath had with Iewes, Iesuites, and people
of sundry other countries: and by perfiting any thing
which herein shall be thought imperfect.</P>
<P>And yet I haue had conference with one of the Au∣thors,
and shewed his Letters vnto many other trauellers
of good iudgement, who haue beene in those parts, and
all of them subscribe vnto the trueth of euery thing ther∣in
contained. And of my selfe I haue set downe nothing
but what I either haue found in the Letters of these two
brethren (master <HI>William Biddulph,</HI> and <HI>Peter Biddulph</HI>)
or else (by conference with one of them and sundry other
trauellers of credit) heard spoken and deliuered for truth.</P>
<P>Onely in two things (I confesse) I haue beene some∣what
bold with mine Authors. First, in the number of
their: letters for whereas they wrote very many letters,
<PB REF="6"/>
and his companions went thither onely as trauellers to
see the Holy Land.</P>
<P>Againe, if it were his owne doing, he being both wise
and Religious (as hee is accounted) would neuer bee so
simple to publish his owne disgrace in Printe, in going
to Masse, and obseruing many other ceremonies as are
mentioned in that booke which goeth foorth vnder his
name.</P>
<P>In the voiage of the fiue Englishmen from <HI>Syria</HI> to <HI>Iu∣daea,</HI>
(which is the last letter) I haue written only of their
trauels thither, and such things as they saw there, but no∣thing
of their returne, for I could not meet with any let∣ter
wherein my Authour had written thereof, neither
could I learne it of him by conference with him, for
when I spake vnto him thereof, desiring him to set it
downe in writing for my further direction, I could haue
no other answere of him but this which <HI>Aeneas</HI> spake to
Queene <HI>Dido,</HI> as <HI>Vigil.</HI> setteth it downe <HI>Aeneid. lib.</HI> 2.</P>
<Q>Infandum regina iubes renouare dolorem.</Q>
<P>that is,</P>
<Q><L>A dolefull worke me to renew</L>
<L>(Deare friend) you craue, wherefore adew.</L></Q>
<P>Whereby I perceiued he tooke no pleasure to talke of
it, and lesse to write of it. The reason, I vnderstood by
others; because it was more dangerous, troublesome,
and tedious to him then all the rest of his voiage: for ma∣nie
nights they slept in the open fields, when it rained all
night exceeding fast, and in the day time they were often
<PB REF="7"/>
dangered by theeues, and oftentimes in the night they
were glad to hire a guard to watch whiles they slept, for
feare lest their throats should be cut whiles they were a∣sleepe:
and many other miseries they were subiect vnto,
as hunger and thirst, heate in the day, cold (being har∣borles)
in the night.</P>
<P>And besides many miseries which hee hath indured
by land; he hath very narrowly escaped many extreame
dangers by Sea, whereof I will mention only one, which
I haue heard, not only from his owne mouth (with grate∣full
memorie vnto God for his miraculous and vnexpe∣cted
preseruation) but also from others who were in the
same danger with him. In relation whereof they all a∣gree
in one, that it was on this manner.</P>
<P>Ann. Dom. 1605 Febr. 9. He, with some other En∣glishmen,
viz. <HI>Sampson Newport,</HI> and his brother <HI>Edward
Newport, Edward Concke, Martin Kentish, William Welch,
Thomas Mania<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> and others: hauing occasion to trauell
from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Zante</HI> (for want of an English ship)
imbarked thēselues in a <HI>Raguzean</HI> ship which was bound
thither. Wherein they sailed safely, vntill they came a∣mongst
the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> or the 53. Iles in the Arches, where
they were a while becalmed ouer against <HI>Milo,</HI> where
they were minded to touch.</P>
<P>But suddenly this calme was turned to a storme, which
speedily droue them out of the sight of <HI>Milo,</HI> and <HI>Ami∣milo,</HI>
and so confounded the <HI>Raguzean</HI> Mariners (being
no skilfull Nauigators) that they knew not where they
were, (an vncomfortable case in such a dangerous place,
amongst so many Ilands so thicke together.) Before them
they sawe land in three places, yet none of them knew
whether it were the maine land, or some Iland, and ther∣fore
<PB REF="7"/>
were ignorant what course to take. The prouidence
of God so directed, that they passed so neere the Ile <HI>Se∣rigotta,</HI>
as seldome or neuer any ship did, and not rush
vpon the rockes.</P>
<P>When they were past this Iland, they were out of the
Arches or <HI>Cyclades,</HI> and had sea-roome inough, which
was some comfort.</P>
<P>But the ignorance of the Mariners, The violence of
the storme, The weaknes of the ship, and the prophane∣nesse
of the company with whom he was shipped, were
great causes of discomfort.</P>
<P>The Mariners were ignorant, not accustomed to saile
by compas or cunding of the ship, but by the eie and
view, and to be still in sight of land, The storme still in∣creased
more vehemently, and continued three daies and
three nights together; during which time, they could nei∣ther
eate nor drinke, nor sleepe. The ship was weake and
halfe full of water, ready to be split in pieces with euery
blast of wind, or to bee deuoured by euery waue of the
Sea.</P>
<P>The boat which the ship towed after her, was cut off,
and let goe at randome without hope of euer seeing it a∣gaine,
lest it should be full of water, and sinke, and draw
the ship also vnder water. The companie as they were
of diuers nations, so of diuers natures: and as they dif∣fered
in religion, so likewise in their conuersation and ca∣riage,
during the continuance of this tempest. For the
storme increased, the aire thundered, the winds bluste∣red,
the Sea raged, and the waues thereof arising like
mightie mountaines, tossed vp the ship (to vse the Poets
<HI>Hyperbole</HI>) sometimes as high as heauen, and by and by
tumbled her downe againe as low as hell; so that (as the
<PB REF="8"/>
Psalmist speaketh, Psal. 107. 27.) <HI>They were tossed to and
fro, and staggered like drunken men, and all their cunning be∣ing
gone,</HI> euery man called vpon his god (like the Mari∣ners
in <HI>Ionas</HI> ship.) The <HI>Raguzeans</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> called vp∣on
all the gods and goddesses, the Hee Saints, and She
Saints, and cast <HI>Grand Benedicta</HI> into the sea, to asswage
the madnes therof. Which nothing preuailing, the ma∣ster
of the ship called master <HI>Samson Newport</HI> (an English
Merchant) and told him in Italian that hee vnderstood
that the Signior <HI>Reuerendo Dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore Inglese:</HI> that is, That the
reuerend English Doctor (who was in his ship) had bin
at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and requested him to speake vnto him, if he
had any holy reliques in his chest which hee brought
from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to giue him some to throw into the Sea,
to pacifie the rage thereof. M. <HI>Newport</HI> made answer,
that he knew that their English Preacher had no such
Reliques as he desired.</P>
<P>Then there was nothing amongst the superstitious Pa∣pists,
but weeping and wringing of hands; some prepa∣ring
boards ready to cast themselues into the Sea, loo∣king
at euery blast when the ship would bee disiointed
and shaken asunder: Others pattering on beads, and ma∣king
large vowes to <HI>Madonna de Lauretta,</HI> if shee would
deliuer them; and to this Saint and that Saint, if they
escaped.</P>
<P>The Master of the ship, called <HI>Andrea,</HI> and his bro∣ther
<HI>Stephano,</HI> (being both owners of the ship) said, that
surely the English Doctor was a Coniurer, for they ne∣uer
saw him without a booke in his hand, but still read∣ing,
vntill (by his learning) he had raised a storme vpon
them; and thought it best to make a <HI>Ionas</HI> of him, and
to cast both him and his books into the Sea: which they
<PB REF="8"/>
had done indeed, if God (in mercy towards him) had
not preuented them; for our Englishmen (like good
Christians) hauing learned out of the Scriptures (Psal.
46. 1.) That <HI>God is a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent helpe in time of trouble,</HI> and hath
promised to deliuer them that call vpon him in time of
trouble, gaue themselues both iointly and seuerally to
praier, and all the time of this tempest <HI>cried vnto the Lord
in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distresse.
He turned the storme to calme, so that the waues thereof were
still.</HI> And so (at length) by the prouidence of God, they
came all safely to their desired Port, where they heard
of many ships (as some reported, fiftie) which were cast
away in that storme, out of which they were deliuered.
Many such desperate plunges hath he escaped in his ten
yeeres trauell, which I haue heard of, but forbeare (for
breuities sake) to speake of.</P>
<P>These things considered, I thought it not meet to presse
him any further therewith, lest the remembrance of for∣mer
miseries, should be a cause of fresh sorowes, know∣ing
that he hath indured much hardnesse both by sea and
by land, &amp; so much as may seeme admirable, yea, almost
incredible that such a spare leane man, and of such a
weake body (as he seemed to be of) should endure in ten
yeeres tedious trauell together. And yet notwithstan∣ding
his continuall dangers both by sea and by land, hee
hath continued still to preach the Gospel constantly and
boldly (in Heathen countries) both by sea and by land;
receiued great honour amongst them; and is now at
length (by the prouidence of God) returned into his na∣tiue
countrie in health and safety to preach the Gospell
wheresoeuer it shall please God to call him: and is at this
<PB REF="9"/>
day the greatest traueller (of a man of his calling, that I
know) in all England both by sea and land.</P>
<P>By land, he hath trauelled further then <HI>Iacob,</HI> and the
same way that <HI>Iacob</HI> did from <HI>Hebron</HI> to <HI>Padan Aram,</HI>
and hath had as hard lodging in his trauell as <HI>Iacob</HI> had,
viz. the ground to his bed, a stone for his pillow, the skie
for his couering, and sometimes the aire for his supper.</P>
<P>By Sea, farther then S. <HI>Paul,</HI> then <HI>Aeneas,</HI> or <HI>Vlysses</HI>
haue done, and all the whole way that they all haue tra∣uelled,
and further.</P>
<P>Wherefore (gentle Reader) if thou take in good part
these his trauels, and my paines and labour in collecting
them together, it may perhaps encourage him to en∣large
them, and me to procure them, and to adde there∣unto
his conference and disputations with Iewes, Iesuits,
and sundry other nations (which I vnderstand hee hath
had with them) and such arguments as haue beene vsed
on both sides, &amp; letters in sundry languages which haue
beene written on both sides from one to another.</P>
<P>In the meane time, I leaue him (with his foure fellow
trauellers) soiourning at the earthly Ierusalem; and thee
(gentle Reader) trauelling towards the heauenly <HI>Ierusa∣lem:</HI>
where God grant at length we may all ariue, IESVS
CHRIST being our Pilot and Ienisary to conduct vs
thereunto, AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER SENT
from Constantinople, to a learned Gen∣tleman
in England, wherein the Author discourseth of
his voiage from England thither, and of such famous
places, and memorable matters as hee saw in the
way thither.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Orshipfull, and my worthy good
friend, in most kind and curteous
manner I salute you: wishing vn∣to
you all ioyes internall, externall,
and Eternall. Being now (by the
prouidence of God) after long and
tedious trauell, arriued in safety at
<HI>Constantinople:</HI> and calling to mind
your continuall kindnesse towards
me since our first acquaintance, and
your earnest request vnto me at my
departure out of <HI>England,</HI> which was, to acquaint you with such
occurrences as in my voyage should offer themselues vnto my
viewe; I could not without some note of ingratitude (which I
would not willingly incur) refuse to impart vnto you what me∣morable
matters and famous places I haue seene and obserued in
my voyage.</P>
<P>May it please you therefore to vnderstand, that after our depar∣ture
from the coast of <HI>England,</HI> wee saw no land vntill wee came
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
neere vnto the coast of <HI>Spaine:</HI> and then appeared first of all in
sight vnto vs a towne in <HI>Spaine</HI> called <HI>Territh</HI> or <HI>Tenerith,</HI> which
was discerned first by a red sandy path on a mountaine neere vn∣to
it. And shortly after, wee saw <HI>lubraltore</HI> on <HI>Europe</HI> side, and
<HI>Abshi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (commonly called <HI>Ape hill</HI>) on <HI>Affrica</HI> side, betwixt which 2.
places we entred in at the straights mouth, with a swift currant
and a good wind, commonly called the straights of <HI>leubraltore,</HI> be∣twixt
which place and <HI>Porungal,</HI> wee saw many Whales in the
bay or G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lph of <HI>Portingal.</HI> And in three dayes sailing from the
straights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argier.</NOTE> we arriued at <HI>Argier</HI> in <HI>Barbary,</HI> where we staied three
daies, and were kindly intreated both by <HI>Ally Bashaw</HI> king of <HI>Ar∣gier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rayse, signi∣fieth a Cap∣taine.</NOTE>
and also by <HI>Amurath Rayse,</HI> commonly called <HI>Morat Rayse.</HI>
This citie is in forme like vnto a top-saile, broad below, and nar∣row
aboue. It is situated on the side of an hill, walled about, and
a strong Castle neere vnto the water side. It was first called
<HI>Mesgana,</HI> secondly, <HI>Iol,</HI> the royall seate of <HI>IVBA,</HI> the noble king
of <HI>Mauritania.</HI> who in the time of the ciuil warre betwixt <HI>Caesar</HI> and
<HI>Pompey,</HI> valiantly defended <HI>Pompeyes</HI> part. By the Moores and
Turkes at this day it is called <HI>Iezaier,</HI> but by the Spaniards it is
called <HI>Algier.</HI> The people of this place, and the Spaniards are
bitter enemies, and annoy one another oftentimes.</P>
<P>About 300. leagues from <HI>Argier</HI> wee saw <HI>Teddel,</HI> a citie in
<HI>Affrica,</HI> and cape <HI>Bonne,</HI> which was formerly called <HI>Hyppo,</HI> where
S. <HI>Augustine</HI> was Bishop, and <HI>Tunis,</HI> neere whereunto the anci∣ent
citie <HI>Carthage</HI> stood, built by Queene <HI>Dido,</HI> whereof some ru∣mes
are yet to bee seene.</P>
<P><HI>Tunis</HI> is in <HI>Libia,</HI> and <HI>Morocus</HI> and <HI>Fesse</HI> in <HI>Numidia.</HI></P>
<P>About these parts we saw flying fishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flying Fishes.</NOTE> as big an Hearing,
with two great sinnes like vnto wings before, and two lesse be∣hind;
who being chased by <HI>Dolphines</HI> and <HI>Bonitaes,</HI> fly as long as
their wings are wet, which is not farre, but oft agables length.
<HI>Porpisces</HI> and many other strange and deformed fishes we saw in
our voiage, the names whereof we knew not. We saw also sword
fishes and threshers: which two kind of fishes are deadly enemies
vnto the Whale. The sword fish swimmeth vnder him and pric∣keth
him vp, and then the Thresher, when hee hath him vp, bela∣boureth
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
him with his flayle or extraordinary long taile, and ma∣keth
him roare.</P>
<P>On the other side, ouer against <HI>Barbary</HI> in the Spanish sea,
we saw two Iles called <HI>Baleares,</HI> which are also called <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orque
Minorque,</HI> thirty miles distant the one from the other. And o∣ther
2. Iles in the <HI>Balearique</HI> sea, called <HI>Ieuis</HI> &amp; <HI>Ebusus</HI> betweene
<HI>Sardinia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> the earth whereof will suffer no venemous
thing to liue: we saw also an Ile called now <HI>Pantalarea,</HI> but of
old it was called <HI>Paconia.</HI> It is very full of hils and rockes:
there groweth great quantity of Cotton, Capers, Figs, Melons
and Reisings. The Iland is full of cesternes. They say, that
not onely the men of that Iland, but the women also are natu∣rally
good swimmers, but whether they be all so or not, I know
not: but sure I am, we saw one woman come swimming from
thence to our ship (being becalmed) with a basket of fruite to
sell. The Ile is but thirtie miles in length, and ten miles in
breadth.</P>
<P>The day following, we saw <HI>Sicilia,</HI> a famous Iland in the
<HI>Tyrrhen</HI> sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sicilia.</NOTE> 618. miles about. The Iland is most pleasant,
and no lesse fertile. In this Iland is <HI>Aetna,</HI> an high hill, burning
continnally with brimstone: it is now called <HI>Mons Gibelli;</HI> out
of this hill riseth most horrible smoake, and flames of fire, and
sometimes burning stones in great number. I haue heard that
in this Ile there is a water whereinto if a dog be cast, he will die
presently, but being taken out and cast into another water neere
vnto it, he liueth againe, but this I haue not seene, and there∣fore
referre it to others which haue seene it. <HI>Messana,</HI> common∣ly
called <HI>Missina,</HI> is the chiefest citie in <HI>Sicilie,</HI> neere the <HI>Promon∣tory
Pelorus.</HI> In the sea néere vnto this Iland, there is a dan∣gerous
rocke called <HI>Scylla,</HI> and ouer against this dangerous
rocke, there is a gulfe of the sea called <HI>Charibdis,</HI> commonly at
this day called the <HI>Kirbies.</HI> It is a very dangerous place, by rea∣son
of streames flowing contrary each to other. It is ouer a∣gainst
<HI>Scylla:</HI> Marriners which saile betwixt these two, are
carefull to keepe an euen course, lest, whiles they seeke to shun
the one, they rush vpon the other, according to that verse,</P>
<Q><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
<L>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charib dim.</L></Q>
<P>that is,</P>
<Q><L>Seeking to auoid one danger, they fall into another.</L></Q>
<P>And in the <HI>Terrhen</HI> sea by <HI>Sicilie</HI> there is another Ile called
<HI>Strongyle</HI> or <HI>Stromboly,</HI> which burneth in like sort as <HI>Aetna</HI>
doeth, it is ouer against <HI>Naples. Sicilia</HI> is 50. leagues in length,
that is 150. miles, accounting three leagues to a mile.</P>
<P>Ouer against cape <HI>Passera</HI> (which is a marke for Marriners
at the Eastward end of <HI>Sicilia</HI>) there is an Iland called <HI>Malta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Malta.</NOTE>
where (vpon some occasion) we touched. It is that Iland men∣tioned
<HI>Act.</HI> 28. 1, 2. where the viper came on <HI>Pauls</HI> hand. It
was then called <HI>Melita,</HI> but now <HI>Malta.</HI> The inhabitants were
then <HI>Barbarians,</HI> yet shewed <HI>Paul</HI> no little kindnesse, for they
<HI>kindled a fire, and receiued him and his companie, because of the
present colde, &amp;c.</HI> But now they are such <HI>Barbarous</HI> people
which inhabit it, that rather then they will receiue <HI>Paul</HI> and
his companions (I mean Protestants or any good Christians)
to the fire in kindnes to warme them, they will rather in cru∣eltie
cast them into the fire to burne them. Then a viper came
on <HI>Pauls</HI> hand, and hee shooke him off without hurt: but now
there are so manie viperous people there, who vse so strict In∣quistion
when strangers come, that it is impossible for a good
man to shake them off without harme either to his soule, if hee
dissemble,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Renegadoes</HI> of denying the faith.</NOTE> or to his body, if he professe the trueth. The inha∣bitants
are Renegadoes and Bandidoes of sundry nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bandidoes</HI> are banished men</NOTE> es∣pecially,
<HI>Greekes, Italians, Spaniards, Moores</HI> and <HI>Maltezes:</HI>
There are many Souldiers there, who are in pay vnder the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and their Captaines are called Knights of <HI>Malta.</HI>
The common sort weare no other clothing (because of the ex∣treamitie
of the heat) then a linnen or white shirt girded vnder
their brests, and ouer the same a fine white woollen mantle,
called by the <HI>Moores</HI> a <HI>Barnuse.</HI> There are in this Iland 60.
Castles, &amp; as many villages, all well inhabited. There grow∣eth
great store of Cottons, Pomegranates, Cytrons, Orenges,
Melons, and other exellent fruits; but for wheat &amp; wine, they
doe furnish themselues out of <HI>Sicilia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<HI>Tripoly</HI> in <HI>Barbary</HI> is a City situated on the maine land, vpon
the coast of the <HI>Mediterranian</HI> Sea. It was builded by the
<HI>Romans,</HI> and afterward subdued by the <HI>Gothes,</HI> which posses∣sed
the same vnto the time of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>The next places of any note, which wée saw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zephalonia.</NOTE> were two
Ilands in <HI>Graecia,</HI> namely, <HI>Zephalonia</HI> and <HI>Zante,</HI> betwixt
which two our Ship passed. Both of them are inhabited by
<HI>Greekes,</HI> but gouerned by the Signiory of <HI>Venice,</HI> who every
third yéere send <HI>Prouidores</HI> with other Officers to rule there.
They are both very fruitfull Ilands, yéelding great store of
currance, oliues, pomecitrons, oringes, and lemmons, but
small store of corne, which they continually fetch from other
Countries. If through extremity of wether, or danger of Pi∣rates,
or cursares, corne be not duly brought vnto them, in
short time they are ready to famish.</P>
<P><HI>Zephalonia</HI> was of old called <HI>Ithaca,</HI> where <HI>Vlysses</HI> the sonne
of <HI>Laertes</HI> was King, who excelled all other <HI>Greeks</HI> in eloquence
and subtilty of wit. He is commended by ancient Writers, for
a famous Traueller: but if he were liuing in these daies, his
trauels would be counted nothing, in respect of the trauels of
many other now liuing: for he trauelled but betwixt <HI>Venice</HI>
and <HI>Egypt</HI> which is now a common voyage.</P>
<P><HI>Zante,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zante▪</NOTE> of old was called <HI>Zacynthus,</HI> it was somtimes a wooddy
Ile in the sea <HI>Ionium,</HI> on the West of <HI>Peloponesus.</HI> But there
is now very little wood in it. It is hilly round about, but the
middle of it is a plaine and fruitfull valley, yéelding great store
of Currance, which are brought from thence into <HI>England.</HI> The
<HI>Greekes</HI> wonder what we vse to doe with so many Currance,
and aske sometimes whether we vse to dye with them, or feed
Hogges with them. They were a very poore kind of people,
when our English Marchants vsed traffique there first: but
now they are growen rich and proud.</P>
<P>There is also a citie in that Ile called <HI>Zante</HI> by the name of the
Iland, which citie was built by <HI>Zacynthus</HI> sonne to <HI>Dardanus,</HI>
who raigned there. We staied ten dayes in the rode of this city
before we could get Pratticke, that is: leaue to come amongst
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
them, or to vse traffique with them, for their custome is not to
giue present Pratticke vnto any strangers, vnlesse they bring a
letter of health from the place whence they come, which we had
not. And therefore some of our companie who had businesse
there, we sent to the <HI>Lazaretta,</HI> which is a place like vnto the pest
house in More-fields, where, though they be in health, yet there
they must stay so long as it pleaseth the Signiors of health,
which is sometime twenty, and sometimes forty dayes: and
in the meane time, if any of their companie fall sicke, though it
be at the end of fortie daies, yet must they stay forty daies lon∣ger.
So long as they are kept without Pratticke, they haue a
Guardian set to watch them that they come into no companie,
neither any man into theirs: yet may their friends come to vi∣sit
them, and standing farre off, may speake with them, but if
they come too neere them, the Guardian will cry out vnto them,
<HI>Alargo, alargo,</HI> that is: Stand backe. And whosoeuer cōmeth
so néere them as to touch them, looseth his owne Pratticke, and
must kéepe them companie during their continuance there. If
they bring any letters for any Merchants in the Citie, the Gu∣ardiā
wil open them &amp; aire them at the fice before he wil deliuer
them. But if the letter be sowed (or if there bee any thread a∣bout
them) they must not be deliuered vntill they that brought
them haue Prattick. And this they doe vnder pretence of auoi∣ding
sicknesse: but they haue a further meaning therein, <HI>viz.</HI>
partly to get money and bribes; and partly to bee acquainted
with the businesse of all commers, and what commodities they
bring. And whosoeuer presumeth to come on shoare without
Pratticke, is in danger of hanging, or hauing the strappado. And
though they haue a certificate that there is health in the place
from whence they came, yet must they not come on shoare be∣fore
they haue shewed their <HI>Fede,</HI> or <HI>Neate patent</HI> vnto three
officers, called Signiors of health.</P>
<P><HI>Zante</HI> is very much subiect vnto earthquakes. There is no
yeere passeth without many earthquakes, especially in the mo∣neths
of September and October, in which moneths I haue
knowen two or three earthquakes in one weeke. In regard
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
whereof they build houses very lowe, lest they should bee
ouerthrowen by earthquakes. And when they feele the earth∣quakes
beginne (whether it be by day or by night) the <HI>Greekes</HI>
vse presently to ring their bels to stir vp the people unto Praier.</P>
<P>In <HI>Zante</HI> there is a very strong Castle standing on an high
hill, it is also very large, halfe as big as the Citie of <HI>Zante,</HI> and
therein dwelleth the <HI>Prouidatore</HI> who gouerneth the Iland,
and many other: and there is the place of iudgement where all
causes both Criminall and Iudiciall are decided by the <HI>Pro∣uidatore</HI>
&amp; his Counselliers: ouer which place these two Lattin
verses are written on the walle in letters of gold.</P>

<HI>Morea,</HI> but of old <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> almost enuironed with the sea,
hauing on the West and South, the sea <HI>Adriaticum;</HI> on the east
the sea of <HI>Creete:</HI> And in the middle of <HI>Peloponnesus</HI> is a Coun∣try
called <HI>Arcadia,</HI> so called of <HI>Arcas</HI> sonne to <HI>Jupiter</HI> by <HI>Calistho,</HI>
who raigned there. <HI>Arcadia</HI> is famous for shepheards: There
are great store of shéepe continually feeding, and good pasture
for them. In the narrow strait, going into <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> was
<HI>Corinth,</HI> that famous City in <HI>Achaia,</HI> situated, but now vtter∣ly

dedicated vnto the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> whereunto there is great re∣sort
of such as haue escaped dangers by sea, or sicknesse, or other
dangers by land, to offer something to <HI>Madonna de Gazopo,</HI>
for their deliuerance. And amongst many others, it was told vs

an <HI>Italian</HI> ship being in great distresse by extremity of wether in
the gulfe of <HI>Venice,</HI> when all hope of helpe by worldly meanes
was past, euery man fell to praier (like the Mariners in <HI>Ionas</HI>
ship) and euery man called vpon his god, some to <HI>Neptune,</HI>
some to <HI>S. Nicolas,</HI> some to one Saint, some to another: But
the master of the ship praied to <HI>Madonna de Gazopo,</HI> in this
manner: <HI>O blessed Virgin, deliuer me out of this danger, and J
will offer vnto thee (if I come safely to Gazopo) a candle as bigge
as the maine maste of my ship.</HI> One of his mates hearing him,
plucked him by the shoulders, and said, O master, what doe
you meane to dally with our blessed Lady in this extremitie?
For it is impossible you should performe it. Whereunto he re∣plied,
Hold thy peace foole, it concerneth vs to speake faire now
we are in danger, and to make large promises: but if she deliuer
vs, I will make her content with a candle of seuen or eight in
the pound. Not much vnlike vnto another desperate Mariner
whom I haue heard of, who in a dangerous storme, séeing eue∣ry
man fall to his praiers, and prepare themselues to die, he fell
on his knées, and praied in this manner: <HI>O Lord, I am no com∣mon
begger; I doe not trouble thee euery day; for I neuer praied
to thee before; and if it please thee to deliuer me this once, I will
neuer pray to thee againe as long as I liue.</HI> So true is that old
saying, <HI>Qui nescit orare, discat nauigare:</HI> that is, <HI>He that know∣eth
not how to pray, let him goe downe to sea.</HI> For great dangers
by sea do driue them to praier who neuer praied before, though
none pray effectually, but the faithfull who pray feruently.</P>
<P>From <HI>Madonna de Gazopo</HI> we sailed along by <HI>Albania,</HI> and
were driuen with a crosse winde to <HI>Ottronto</HI> in <HI>Calabria,</HI> at the
entrance into the gulfe of <HI>Venice,</HI> where we staied two daies.
And then we had a good winde, which brought vs to <HI>Ragouza,</HI>
an ancient City in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> which is a part of <HI>Jllyrium,</HI> or
<HI>Illyricum</HI> (as others call it) bordering vpon <HI>Liburnia</HI> Eastward.
But at this day, that which of old was called <HI>Illyris</HI> or <HI>Illyricum,</HI>
is now called <HI>Sclauonia</HI> or <HI>Wendenlande;</HI> hauing on the North,
<HI>Pannonia;</HI> on the West, <HI>Jstria;</HI> on the East, <HI>Mysia superior;</HI> on
the South, the <HI>Adriaticke</HI> Sea. It was so called of <HI>Illyrius</HI> son
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
to <HI>Polyphemus.</HI> From thence we sailed along the <HI>Illyrian</HI> shoare
in the gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI> and came to an hauen towne in <HI>Istria</HI>
called <HI>Rauina</HI> ouer against <HI>Rauenna</HI> on the coast of <HI>Calabria:</HI>
which <HI>Rauenna</HI> is an ancient Citie in <HI>Italy,</HI> by the <HI>Adri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tticke</HI>
Sea. At <HI>Rauina</HI> we tooke in a Pilot to direct vs to <HI>Venice. Istria</HI>
is a part of <HI>Italy</HI> ioyning to <HI>Illyricum,</HI> and is now called <HI>Scla∣uonia.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Rauina</HI> in one dayes sayling we arriued at <HI>Leo</HI> néere vn∣to
<HI>Venice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Venice.</NOTE> which is a most famous Citie, so well knowen vnto
all men by report, that I néed not to spend any time in descri∣bing
it, lest I should rather obscure it, then any way (by my
barren stile) illustrate the same, onely this I note, that there
is both a countrey called <HI>Venetia,</HI> and a Citie called also by the
same name.</P>
<P>The countrey of <HI>Venice</HI> ioyneth to the <HI>Adriaticke</HI> Sea on
the one side, and hath the Alpes on the other side. Therein are
these Cities, <HI>Verona, Vincentia, Patauium,</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> the head
citie of the rest.</P>
<P><HI>Patauium</HI> is the Citie and Vniuersitie of <HI>Padua</HI> by <HI>Padus.</HI>
This <HI>Padus</HI> is the riuer <HI>Po</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> which riseth out of <HI>Vesulus,</HI>
the highest hill of the Alpes, and runneth by the marches of <HI>Li∣guria,</HI>
into the <HI>Adriaticke</HI> Sea. One arme of <HI>Padus</HI> called <HI>Pa∣dusa</HI>
stretcheth to <HI>Rauenna.</HI></P>
<P>The Citie <HI>Venice</HI> standeth in the <HI>Adriatticke</HI> sea, not far from
the countrey of <HI>Venice.</HI> We stayed in <HI>Venice</HI> 17. daies, and ha∣uing
ended our businesse there, wee returned to <HI>Zante,</HI> where,
after we had staied thrée daies, we set saile for <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefest places of note which we saw betwixt <HI>Zante</HI> and
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> are these: First, not farre from <HI>Zante,</HI> wée
passed by two Iles on the West side of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> in the sea
<HI>Jonium,</HI> called of old <HI>Strophades</HI> or <HI>Plotae,</HI> but vulgarly at this
day, <HI>Striuales,</HI> whereof one of them is vninhabited, the other
inhabited only by certaine of their religious men, whom they
call <HI>Coloires,</HI> about thirty in number, who weare long haire,
and neuer eat flesh, and very seldome fish, but at certaine sea∣sons
of the yéere, but liue of hearbes, oliues, oile, and wine, and
such like things. They neuer come out of that Ile, neither euer,
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
vpon any occasion admit any women to come amongst them:
for they may not marry, but liue single and solitary al the daies
of their life. A <HI>Coloire</HI> hath his etymologie of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>&amp;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>▪ <HI>calos
hiereus,</HI> that is, <HI>bonus Sacerdos, a good Priest.</HI></P>
<P>From thence wée sailed along in sight of the maine land of
<HI>Graecia,</HI> which amongst all other Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> hath
béene accounted the most noble and most famous. It was first
called <HI>Helles,</HI> of one of the sonnes of <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> And
afterwards it was called <HI>Graecia,</HI> of a King whose name was
<HI>Graecus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Peloponnesus</HI> is a Prouince in <HI>Greece,</HI> now called <HI>Morea.
Macedonia</HI> is also a large Country in <HI>Europe,</HI> or Prouince in
<HI>Graecia,</HI> now called <HI>Romnelli:</HI> It hath on the East, the Sea
<HI>Aegaeum;</HI> on the West, the Sea <HI>Ionium;</HI> on the South, <HI>Epirus;</HI>
on the North, <HI>Dalmatia.</HI> It was first called <HI>Emathia,</HI> of <HI>Ema∣thias,</HI>
who was King thereof. Afterwards, <HI>Macedonia,</HI> of <HI>Ma∣cedon</HI>
the sonne of <HI>Deucalion.</HI> The <HI>Macedonians</HI> descended of
<HI>Sethim,</HI> sonne of <HI>Iaon.</HI> The Prouinces of <HI>Macedonia</HI> are these:
first, <HI>Thessalia;</HI> secondly, <HI>Hellade;</HI> thirdly, <HI>Myrmidone:</HI> By
reason whereof, <HI>Homer</HI> gaue thrée sundry names vnto the <HI>Thes∣salians,</HI>
vz. <HI>Myrmadons, Helenes,</HI> and <HI>Achees.</HI> But at the last
it was called <HI>Thessalia,</HI> of <HI>Thessale</HI> which possessed that King∣dome.
The principal Citie in <HI>Macedonia</HI> is <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> which
at this day is called <HI>Salonica</HI> by corruption. In this part of <HI>Grae∣cia</HI>
is <HI>Parnassus,</HI> a mountaine hauing two tops, whereon the
nine Muses did dwell.</P>
<P><HI>Athens</HI> is still inhabited: it is situated betwéene <HI>Macedonia</HI>
and <HI>Achaia</HI> on the sea coast; first built by <HI>Cecrops,</HI> and called
<HI>Cecropia;</HI> lastly called <HI>Athens,</HI> of <HI>Minerua,</HI> who in <HI>Greece</HI> was
called <HI>Athene.</HI> This City was the mother and nurce of all li∣berall
Arts and Sciences: but now there is nothing but Athe∣isme
and Barbarisme there: for it is gouerned by <HI>Turkes,</HI> and
inhabited by ignorant <HI>Greekes.</HI> Some ruines of ancient buil∣dings
are there yet to be séene. <HI>Thebes</HI> was a famous Citie in
<HI>Macedonia;</HI> but now a small Castle of little account.</P>
<P>After we came as high as the Iland <HI>Creta,</HI> which is now cal∣led
<HI>Candie,</HI> we left the way towards <HI>Egypt,</HI> and entred into
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
the Arches (called <HI>Archipellago</HI>) betwixt <HI>Cerigo</HI> and <HI>Cerigotta.
Cerigo</HI> is an Iland at the entrance into the Arches, subiect to
the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but inhabited by <HI>Greekes.</HI> This Ile was first
called <HI>Scothera,</HI> and after (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith) <HI>Porpheris</HI> for the
beautifull marbles which are there. <HI>Plinie,</HI> and diuers others
doe call it <HI>Citherea,</HI> by the name of <HI>Cithere</HI> the sonne of <HI>Phaenis,</HI>
and is now called <HI>Cerigo▪</HI> where <HI>Venus</HI> made her first habitati∣on,
and therein is a Temple erected for her. The ruines of that
Temple of <HI>Venus</HI> are to bee séene there to this day. A little be∣low
this Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> vpon the same mountaine, was the
Castle of <HI>Menalaus</HI> husband to <HI>Helene,</HI> who was king of <HI>Sparta.</HI>
and Lord of this Ile. Departing from <HI>Cerigo,</HI> we came amongst
the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> which are 53. Iles in the sea <HI>Aegaeum,</HI> called also
by some <HI>Sporades,</HI> but vulgerly, the <HI>Arches</HI> or <HI>Archipelago.</HI>
But more properly <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clade,</HI> and not vnfitly <HI>Sparades,</HI> althogh
<HI>Sporades</HI> are taken especially for certaine scattered Ilands in
the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Sea, about <HI>Creete</HI> or <HI>Candia,</HI> which is not farre
from the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> or Iles in the <HI>Arches.</HI> Onely this is the
difference, that all the Ilands betwixt <HI>Cic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> and <HI>Candia</HI> are
in the <HI>Ionian</HI> sea. But <HI>Cerigo</HI> and all the Ilands in <HI>Archipel∣lago</HI>
are in the <HI>Aegean</HI> sea. On a cléere day a man may sée twen∣ty
Ilands at one time in these Arches. It is a dangerous place
for shipping in a storme, by reason that the Ilands are so néere
together, whereof some are inhabited, and some not.</P>
<P>About twenty leagues from <HI>Cerigo,</HI> we touched at an Iland
called at this day <HI>Milo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Milo.</NOTE> but of old, <HI>Miletum,</HI> mentioned in S.
<HI>Pauls</HI> voyage, <HI>Act.</HI> 20. 15. This Ile is inhabited by <HI>Greekes,</HI>
and yéeldeth great store of milstones and dymmety, which are
there both good and good cheape. Whiles our ship staied at <HI>Mi∣lo,</HI>
we tooke boat to saile to sée another Iland not farre from <HI>Mi∣lo,</HI>
called of old, <HI>Delos,</HI> where sometimes was the famous
Temple aud Oracle of <HI>Apollo:</HI> But at this day it is called <HI>Sdi∣les,</HI>
and is a very small and poore Iland.</P>
<P>About twenty miles from <HI>Delos</HI> there is another Ile called
of old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delos.</NOTE> <HI>Seriphus,</HI> by an inhabitant whereof <HI>Themistocles</HI> was
vpbraided, that the commendation and fame he gat, was for
his Countries sake, because hée was borne an <HI>Atheman.</HI> But
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
<HI>Themistocles</HI> answered the <HI>Seriphian,</HI> that neither had himselfe
béene worse, if hée had beene borne in <HI>Seirphus,</HI> nor the other
better, if he had béene borne at <HI>Athens.</HI> But this Iland com∣monly
is called <HI>Serigo.</HI></P>
<P>But the most famous and fruitfull Iland in all the <HI>Arches</HI> at
this day is <HI>Chios</HI> (as it was formerly called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chios.</NOTE> <HI>Act.</HI> 20. 15.) so cal∣led,
because it resembleth the Gréeke letter <HI>Chi</HI> in forme and fa∣shion:
As also <HI>Delta,</HI> an Ile by <HI>Nilus,</HI> not farre from <HI>Alexan∣dria</HI>
is so called, because it representeth the figure of the letter
<HI>Delta.</HI> But <HI>Chios</HI> is now called commonly <HI>Syo. Chios</HI> is an
Iland in the sea <HI>Aegeum,</HI> betwixt <HI>Lesbos</HI> and <HI>Samos.</HI> It is di∣stant
from <HI>Delos</HI> an hundred miles: it is in circuit nine hun∣dred
furlongs. It was first called <HI>Ethalie</HI> by <HI>Ephodore.</HI> But by
<HI>Methrodorus, Chio,</HI> of the <HI>Nymph Chione;</HI> and (as others say)
<HI>Macrine</HI> or <HI>Pythiosa;</HI> but at this day called <HI>Syo.</HI></P>
<P>This Iland is inhabited chiefly by Gréekes, but gouerned
by Turkes. It is full of gardens, oringes, lemmons, citrons,
figs, peares, apples, pruans, apricocks, dates, and oliues: and
likewise of all sorts of hearbes, swéet flowers, good and holesome
waters. There is also great store of mastick in this <HI>Iland,</HI> which
is gathered of certaine trées like vnto <HI>Lentiscos</HI> trées, in this
manner: About the beginning of the moneths of <HI>Iuly</HI> and <HI>Au∣gust,</HI>
the husbandmen with a sharpe pointed iron, doe rent and
cut the barke of the trées in diuers places, and out of these inci∣sions
and cuts procéedeth the masticke by drops, as it were
gumme, which they gather in the moneth of September fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Iland</HI> are also great store of Partriges, which both
in colour and quality doe much differ from ours. Their colour
is somewhat red, and they are as tame as though they were
chickens or hens. In certaine villages of this <HI>Iland,</HI> the coun∣try
people doe féed them by great flocks, driuing them in the day
time to grase in the mountaines; and towards night, the boyes
or girles (which doe kéepe them) doe call them together by a
whistle or song. And these Partriges being accustomed to such
calls, presently euery flocke (which sometimes are two or thrée
hundred) gather to their conducter, which bringeth them home
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
to their village and dwelling, as though they were hens, or
tame géese. They goe also a feeding by small flocks in the stréets
of the City.</P>
<P>This <HI>Iland</HI> is one of the seuen which contended for <HI>Homers</HI>
birth. And they say that <HI>Homer</HI> was buried in this <HI>Iland,</HI> and
that his sepulcher is to be séene to this day vpon the <HI>Mount He∣lias,</HI>
within an old Castle in this <HI>Iland,</HI> but I haue not séene it.</P>
<P>The maine land of <HI>Asia</HI> is in sight ouer against <HI>Chios,</HI> and
therein <HI>Smyrna, Ephesus,</HI> and <HI>Thyatira,</HI> called now <HI>Tyria,</HI> with
the rest of the seuen Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> to whom <HI>S. Iohn</HI> wrote,
which are mentioned <HI>Reuel.</HI> 1. 11. And <HI>Pathmos</HI> the <HI>Ile</HI> where
<HI>Iohn</HI> was put into a hot tunne of oile, <HI>Reuel.</HI> 1. 9.</P>
<P>After we had staied ten daies in <HI>Chios,</HI> which (as I haue
said) is now vulgarly called <HI>Sio</HI> or <HI>Scio,</HI> we sailed towards
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> by <HI>Mitilene</HI> an <HI>Iland</HI> in the <HI>Aegean</HI> sea. It was
first called, <HI>Lesbos;</HI> secondly, <HI>Issa;</HI> thirdly, <HI>Pelasgie;</HI> fourthly,
<HI>Mitilene</HI> and <HI>Mytais;</HI> and lastly, <HI>Metelyn,</HI> of <HI>Milet</HI> the sonne of
<HI>Phoebus,</HI> which builded the City, and named it <HI>Mytelene.</HI> Of
this City was <HI>Pythagoras, Alceus</HI> the Poet, and his brother
<HI>Antimenides, Theophrastus,</HI> and <HI>Phanius,</HI> and <HI>Arion</HI> that skil∣full
plaier on the harpe, and <HI>Tersander</HI> that famous Musitian.
<HI>Sapho</HI> a woman well learned in Poetry, was also a <HI>Lesbian,</HI>
being called the tenth Muse. She inuented the verses which
(after her name) were called Saphicke Verses.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mytilenes</HI> was formerly called <HI>Bythinia,</HI> which is a
Country in <HI>Asia,</HI> opposite to <HI>Thracia,</HI> néere <HI>Troy.</HI> It was first
called <HI>Bebricia;</HI> after, <HI>Mygdonia;</HI> and then <HI>Bythinia:</HI> but at
this day it is called <HI>Lesbos,</HI> néere vnto <HI>Lemnos,</HI> from whence
commeth the <HI>terra sigillata,</HI> otherwise called <HI>terra Lemnia,</HI> which
is said to be a remedy against poison, the bloody flixe, and the
plague.</P>
<P>From <HI>Mittelyn</HI> we sailed by <HI>Tenedos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenedos.</NOTE> an <HI>Ile</HI> betwixt <HI>Lesbos</HI>
and <HI>Hellespont,</HI> néere <HI>Troy,</HI> whereof <HI>Virgill</HI> speaketh, <HI>Aeneid.</HI> 2.</P>
<Q><L>Est in conspectu Tenedos, notissima fama</L>
<L>Insula, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<Q><L>There is an Ile in sight of Troy,</L>
<L>And Tenedos it hight:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="17"/>
A wealthy land while Priamus state</L>
<L>And kingdome stood vpright.</L></Q>
<P>The best and most excellent wines in all <HI>Graecia</HI> are made at
<HI>Chios</HI> and <HI>Tenedos.</HI> There is also a City in the same <HI>Ile</HI> called
<HI>Tenedos,</HI> built by <HI>Tenes.</HI> In this <HI>Iland</HI> was the Temple of
<HI>Neptune.</HI></P>
<P>Ouer against <HI>Tenedos</HI> is <HI>Troy,</HI> which is also called <HI>Troas</HI> or
<HI>Troada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Troy.</NOTE> whereof I can speake no more but this that hath béene
long since written:</P>
<Q><L>Iam seges est vbi Troia fuit:</L></Q>
<P>That is,</P>
<Q><L>Waste lie the wals that were so good,</L>
<L>And corne now growes where Troy towne stood.</L></Q>
<P>And againe, as <HI>Virgill</HI> speaketh:</P>
<Q><L>—fuit Ilium, &amp; ingens</L>
<L>Gloria Teucrorum.—</L></Q>
<P>That is,</P>
<Q>The City of Troy (<HI>called</HI> Ilium, <HI>of</HI> Ilus <HI>who enlarged the same</HI>)
did florish, and the glory of the Troians was great.</Q>
<P>And finally,</P>
<Q><L>O iam periere ruinae:</L></Q>
<Q><L>The very ruines of it are come to ruine.</L></Q>
<P>The Sea betwéene <HI>Moeotis</HI> and <HI>Tenedos</HI> is called <HI>Pontus.</HI></P>
<P>A little beyond <HI>Troy,</HI> we entered the strait of <HI>Hellespont,</HI>
which is a narrow sea, called <HI>Hellespontus,</HI> of <HI>Helle.</HI> It lieth
betwéene the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea and <HI>Propontis,</HI> and parteth <HI>Europe</HI>
from <HI>Asia,</HI> It is not now called by the name of <HI>Hellespont,</HI> but
it is called now <HI>The Castles;</HI> for there are still two Castles,
which were of old called <HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydos,</HI> one on the one side
of the <HI>Helispont,</HI> the other on the other side, erected in memory
of the loue of <HI>Leander</HI> and <HI>Hera,</HI> ouer which narrow sea he of∣ten
swomme vnto her, and was in the end drowned. The riuer
<HI>Scamander</HI> runneth by the Castles.</P>
<P><HI>Mayto</HI> is still a towne ouer against <HI>Abydos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mayto.</NOTE> but on the same
side as <HI>Seste.</HI> There is made great store of good wine, which is
red in colour, &amp; in taste like claret wine and sugar, and yet they
put no sugar into it, for it is pleasant of it selfe. Héere our Mer∣chants
ships vsually take in wine for their prouision. There
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
are very many wind milles there, hauing ten wings a piece.</P>
<P>The strength of <HI>Constantinople</HI> consistet chiefly in these
two Castles; for these Castles are well fortified with muniti∣on,
and are to examine all shippes that passe by, from whence
they came, and whither they would: and there they are to
pay a tribute to the King. If any Ships refuse to stay from
the Castles, they will shoote them through. But if these Castles
were battered down, <HI>Constantinople</HI> and all the countrey there∣abouts
might be easily wonne. Notwithstanding, these Ca∣stles,
a small flight to kéepe the narrow seas betwixt <HI>Chios</HI> and
the Castles, might in short time famish all that countrey, for
the greatest part of their prouision, for Rice and other Corne,
commeth from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and those parts, with the <HI>Gazenda</HI>
of the great Turk: but I leaue this to martiall men, and marri∣ners.</P>
<P><HI>Gallipolis</HI> is a great &amp; ancient Citie 20. miles distant from the
Castles (which are at this day called the Castles of <HI>Gallipoly,</HI>
in the way to <HI>Constantinople</HI> situated vpon <HI>Cherenes</HI> of <HI>Thra∣cia,</HI>
at the point which looketh towards <HI>Propontis,</HI> which is all
the sea from the straites of <HI>Hellespont</HI> to <HI>Bosphorus Thraicus.</HI>
Some hold opinion that it was built by <HI>Caius Caligula.</HI> And
others say that it was in times past inhabited by French men,
for that this word <HI>Gallipoly▪</HI> signifieth the Citie of the <HI>Gaules</HI> or
Frenchmen, and for that the French men do dwell in <HI>Gaule,</HI> as
<HI>Nicopolis</HI> and <HI>Phillipopolis</HI> signifie the City of <HI>Nicolas</HI> and
<HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Gallipoly</HI> was that famous City <HI>Nice,</HI> where
the Generall Councell was held in <HI>Bythinia.</HI> And néere vnto
<HI>Constantinople</HI> is <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alcedon</HI> or <HI>Chalcedonia</HI> ouer against <HI>By∣zantium,</HI>
which was a famous City in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> where another
Generall Councell was held. But it is now no City, but onely
a plaine field, hauing héere and there an house yet standing. At
the point of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> we first beheld the prospect of <HI>Constan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣nople.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Constanti∣nople.</NOTE>
which is most pleasant to behold, being like vnto a City
in a wood, or a wood in a City, hauing firre trées, Cyprus
trées, and other pleasant trées in gardens adioining to their
houses. It is also adorned with many stately Towers, Chur∣ches,
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
and high Stéeples. The forme of the City is like vnto a
Triangle, whereof two squares are by the water side, the other
adioineth to the Land. After our Ship had saluted the Port,
we went ouer to the other side, and anchored at <HI>Fundac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee,</HI> and
went on shore at <HI>Gallata,</HI> to salute the honourable Sir <HI>Henrie
Lello,</HI> Lord Ambassadour for Quéene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous me∣morie,
and to visit our English Merchants resident there.</P>
<P>Our ship hauing discharged her goods at <HI>Fundacle,</HI> remoued
from thence, and anchored further from shoare, betwixt <HI>Tapa∣nau</HI>
and <HI>Bezetash,</HI> expecting a good winde to depart. <HI>Constan∣tiople</HI>
is on the other side the water in <HI>Thracia,</HI> which is also cal∣led

on the North, <HI>Isther,</HI> on the East, <HI>Pontus,</HI> on the South,

ACHOMET, the 15. Grand-Chan of the
line of OTTOMAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Salutem in Authore salutis, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ince the writing of my former letters, I
hauing often beene at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and
thorowly viewed the same, according to
promise, I haue thought good to write som∣thing
vnto you thereof.</P>
<P>May it please you therefore to vnder∣stand,
that <HI>Constantinopolis</HI> is a Citie in
<HI>Thracia,</HI> so called of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour, because hee en∣larged
the same. It was before called <HI>Byzantium. Strabo</HI> en∣tituled
it <HI>Illustre,</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> &amp; <HI>Iustine</HI> called it <HI>most Noble,</HI> being
one of the most fertile in all <HI>Europe.</HI> It is situted in <HI>Thracia,</HI>
vpon the gulph <HI>Ponthus,</HI> which separateth <HI>Asia</HI> from <HI>Europe.</HI>
The forme thereof is thrée square, whereof the two sides are
washed by the sea, &amp; the third ioyneth vnto the firme land. The
soile thereof is very delectable, bringing foorth all kindes of good
fruites, necessarie for sustenance of humane life. The situation
thereof is so well deuised and ordered, that no Ship can enter,
nor goe foorth but with leaue from the head <HI>Vizeir:</HI> for the
Turke is master of the Sea <HI>Pontike,</HI> which hauing 2. mouths,
the one comming from <HI>Propontidis,</HI> and the other from the Sea
<HI>Euxinum,</HI> (which is the Blacke sea) is by <HI>Ouid</HI> called the Port
of two Seas, for the distance from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Calcedon</HI>
is but 14. furlongs. And the place which by the ancients is cal∣led
<HI>Phane,</HI> situated in <HI>Asia</HI> (whereas <HI>Jason</HI> returning from <HI>Cal∣chos</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
sacrificed vnto the 12. gods) hath in breadth but 10. fur∣longs.
But for as much as many great riuers of <HI>Asia,</HI> &amp; ma∣ny
more of <HI>Europe,</HI> doe fall into the <HI>Euxine</HI> sea, commonly called
the blacke sea; it commeth to passe, that being full, shee gusheth
out through the mouth of her with great violence, into the sea
<HI>Pontique,</HI> and from thence through the straight of <HI>Hellespont</HI>
(being not much broader then thrée furlongs) into the <HI>Aegean</HI>
Sea.</P>
<P>This citie (according to the saying of many ancient Authors)<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of the building and repairing of <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stanti∣nople.</HI></NOTE>
was first builded by the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> vnder the conduct of
their Captaine <HI>Pausanias,</HI> which was about the yeere of the
world 3292. and before the birth of Iesus Christ 663. yeeres;
which, after they had consulted with <HI>Apollo,</HI> where they should
plant and settle their abode and dwelling place, they were by
an oracle answered, that they should doe it, euen hard by the
blind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Me garians</HI> are called blind.</NOTE> which were the <HI>Megarians,</HI> for that, after they were sai∣led
into <HI>Thracia,</HI> leauing the good and fruitfull coast (where
since <HI>Byzantium</HI> was builded) vnaduisedly went and planted
themselues, (either for y<SUP>•</SUP> opposition) in the most fruitful ground
of <HI>Asia,</HI> or for the vain hope they had for the fishing; they builded
there a Citie, which was called <HI>Calcedon.</HI> But they found
themselues greatly deceiued.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calcedon</HI> was builded by the <HI>Megarians.</HI></NOTE> For, the fishes being caried by
the violence of the floud and tide of the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea into <HI>Pro∣pontis,</HI>
approaching néere vnto the Banks of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> being
afraid, through the whitenesse of the rockes, doe retire straight
waies to the side of <HI>Bizantium,</HI> which gaue occasion vnto the
valiant <HI>Paulanias,</HI> to fortifie the Citie with good walles &amp; ram∣piers,
changing the first name thereof, which as <HI>Plinie</HI> saith,
was <HI>Ligos,</HI> and called the same <HI>Bizantium.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding, <HI>Diodorus</HI> &amp; <HI>Polybius</HI> doe contrarily say,
that it was called <HI>Byzantium,</HI> by the name of a Captaine, which
was the first founder thereof. <HI>Pausanias</HI> (as <HI>Zonoras</HI> writeth)
possessed the same seuen yéeres: during which time, (Fortune
shewing her selfe an enemie vnto his magnificence) stuffed the
hearts of the <HI>Athenians</HI> with such an insatiable ambition, that
they hauing brought thither their forces, after a long siege, and
diuers assaults, did beare away the victorie, which the <HI>Lacede
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
monians</HI> seeing could not abide, but with their whole puissance
tooke their weapons in hand with such pertinacy, that the ad∣uenture
thereof on the one side and on the other, was very dan∣gereous
and variable. And being sometimes taken againe by
her first founders, and afterwards by her aggressors, became
in the end a pray vnto both the armies.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Byzanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> ruined by <HI>Se∣uerus</HI> the Em∣perour.</NOTE> And after that, <HI>Seuerus</HI>
succeeding in the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mane</HI> Empire, the tyrant <HI>Pissininus,</HI> her
mortal enemie being in possession, <HI>Byzantium</HI> suborned the Em∣perour
to lay siege vnto the same: who, not hauing sufficient
power to ouercome the same by assaults, kept them besieged
the space of three whole yéeres, &amp; in the end, through extreame
famine, constained them to yéeld themselues vnto the mercy of
the <HI>Romanes,</HI> which was such, that after they had put to the
sword all the men of warre that were within it, and killed the
Maiestrates thereof, ruined and cast downe to the ground the
walles of the Citie: and <HI>Seuerus</HI> afterwards (to satisfie his cru∣eltie)
spoiled the Citizens of all their rights, franchises and liber∣ties;
giuing moreouer the Land and possessions vnto the <HI>Perin∣thians.</HI>
And thus, this most famous Citie remained in miserable
calamitie, vntill such time as <HI>Constantine</HI> the great Emperour
remouing from <HI>Rome,</HI> did réedifie the same.</P>
<P>But before I write any thing of the reedifyigns of <HI>Byzantium</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause wherefore <HI>Constantine</HI> remooued from Rome.</NOTE>
of <HI>Constantine</HI> the great: giue mee leaue to shew you the cause
wherefore <HI>Constantine</HI> remoued from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Thessal.</HI> 2. 7. S. <HI>Paul</HI> prophesying of the reuealing of Anti∣christ,
saith thus: <HI>Yee know what withholdeth that he might be
reuealed in his time, &amp;c.</HI> Which hinderance was the <HI>Romane
Emperous,</HI> which were first to depart from <HI>Rome,</HI> and giue
place to the Popes, because, both Emperours and Popes could
not raigne together in one Citie. And that hinderance was ta∣ken
away long since, when <HI>Constantine</HI> the great translated his
imperiall Seat to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and indowed the Popes with
the Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Italy</HI> lying about it.</P>
<P>The Emperours then being farre off, and (by reason of con∣tinuall
warres with <HI>Saracens</HI> and enemies in the East) notable
to maintaine their own right in the West, the Popes incroach∣ed
vpon them too far, and vsurped so much authoritie, that they
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
discarded them cleane in <HI>Italy,</HI> and at their pleasure set vp other
Emperours in the West, but such as would take an oath to bée
subiect to the Apostolike Sée of <HI>Rome,</HI> and acknowledge the
Popes to be vniuersall Bishops. So the hinderance was ta∣ken
away when <HI>Constantine</HI> remooued to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and
Antichrist was manifestly disclosed not long after when <HI>Boni∣face</HI>
the third obtained the title of Vniuersall Bishop, which
was 900. yéeres agoe, for (as <HI>Gregorie</HI> saith) none but Anti∣christ
would assume vnto him such a title.</P>
<P>But yet <HI>Constantine</HI> had no regard to any prophecie, when
hée remooued at first from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Byzantium,</HI> and there set∣led
his Emperiall pallace: but he respected onely a more com∣modious
gouernement of those matters and kingdomes of his
that lay Eastward, which at that time were miserably disquie∣ted
by the <HI>Parthians</HI> and <HI>Persians.</HI> For <HI>Constantinople</HI> did séem
to be so situated (whereas otherwise <HI>Constantine</HI> had once
thought to haue setled elsewhere) as that it was (as you would
say,) the nauel or middest vnto the whole <HI>Romane</HI> iurisdiction,
which, as we know, spread it selfe farre and néere: and yet it
could not possibly otherwise fall out, because that so the <HI>Romane</HI>
Empire might become double headed, &amp; haue those two horns
which God before had reuealed. So the prouidence of God gui∣ded
this whole enterprise of <HI>Constantine,</HI> and so fulfilled what
himselfe had decréed.</P>
<P>Hereby you may perceiue two causes wherefore <HI>Constantine</HI>
remoued from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>1. The first more secret in the prouidence of God, that the
prophecie of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2. <HI>Thessal.</HI> 2▪ 7. might be fulfilled.</P>
<P>2. The second more publike and better knowen to all, <HI>viz.</HI>
that <HI>Constantine</HI> the great Emperour of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> séeking to
resist the courses and robberies which the <HI>Parthes</HI> daily vsed to∣wards
the <HI>Romanes,</HI> deliberated to transport the Empyre into
the East parts, and there to build a large Citie: which first hee
minded to haue builded in <HI>Sardique,</HI> and afterwards in <HI>Troyada</HI>
a countrey of high <HI>Pmygia</HI> néere vnto the cape <HI>Sige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> in the place
where sometime stood the Citie of <HI>Troy,</HI> which he began to ree∣difie,
and to repaire the foundations thereof. But being by a
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Reuelation in the night inspired to change the place, caused to
be recommenced the workes of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> where certaine Ea∣gles
(as <HI>Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arus</HI> writeth) being flowen thither, tooke in their
bils the masons lines, and crossing the stréete, let them fall neere
vnto <HI>Byzantium▪</HI> whereof the Emperour being aduertised, ta∣king
the same for a good signe and diuine instruction, after hee
had taken view of the place, called backe the masters of his
workes from <HI>Calcedon,</HI> caused the City to be repaired and am∣plifyed,
which, according to his name, he called <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
notwithstanding that at the first he had called the same new
<HI>Rome.</HI> Whereupon it came to passe, that both in generall
Counsels, and in the decrées of Emperours, mention is made of
two <HI>Romes:</HI> one, the olde, which is the true <HI>Rome,</HI> built by
<HI>Romulus;</HI> the other, the new, which is <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which
also began to hold vp the head, by vertue of the priuiledges and
prerogatiues of old <HI>Rome.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Constantinople</HI> is called by the Turkes <HI>Stambolda.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Constantinople</HI> was likewise called <HI>Ethuse</HI> and <HI>Antonie,</HI> but
by the <HI>Grecians Stimboli,</HI> and of the <HI>Turks Stambolda,</HI> which in
their language signifieth a large City, and so it is called by them
at this day.</P>
<P>The Emperour now seeing his Citie builded and sufficiently
peopled, compassed the same with walles, towers and ditches,
building therein many sumptuous Temples, adorning it with
many magnifique buildings, and necessary works as well pub∣lik
as priuate.</P>
<P>And afterwards for the more beautifying thereof, caused to
be brought from <HI>Rome</HI> diuers Antiquities worthy of memorie,
and amongst others the <HI>Palladium</HI> of ancient <HI>Troy,</HI> that is, the
image of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llas</HI> in <HI>Troy,</HI> which he caused to be set in the place of
<HI>Placote</HI> the great columne of <HI>Porphyre</HI> which was set vp in the
same place. Neere vnto which he caused to be erected a Statue
of brasse, to the likenesse of <HI>Apollo,</HI> of a maruailous bignesse, in
which place hee ordained his name to ve set vp. But in the time
of the Emperour <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xis Comine</HI> this Statue, through a great
and impetuous tempest, was cast down to the ground, and bro∣ken
all to pieces.</P>
<P>This Emperour liued there many yéeres most prosperously
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
in happy estate, as likewise did many of his successours, but not
altogether exempted from persecutions, as well by wars, fires,
pestilence, earth-quakes, as sundry other calamities, vntill
such time as God purposing to punish the people for their sins,
through negligence of Emperours, stirred vp <HI>Mahomet</HI> the se∣cond
of that name, and the eighth Emperour vnto the <HI>Turkes,</HI>
who being mooued with an earnest desire to bring the Christi∣ans
vnto decay, and thereby to augment his Empire, being be∣yond
measure iealous to sée this noble City so florish before his
eies, went with a maruellous power both by sea and by land, to
giue a furious siege vnto the City: The end and issue whereof
was such, that after a long siege, battery, and diuers assaults,
the <HI>Jnfidels</HI> hauing gotten the wals, with a great hurlyburly
and fury entred into the city: where at the first entry they made
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperor.</NOTE> a maruellou slaughter of the poore assieged Christians, without
sparing any age or degrée. The <HI>Emperour Constantine</HI> they kil∣led
in the prease, as he though to haue saued himselfe; and af∣ter
that they had cut off his head, in derision and ignominy, they
carried the same vpon the point of a speare, round about the
Campe and City. And afterwards <HI>Mahomet</HI> not contenting
himselfe with the violating and deflouring of the Emperours
wife, daughters, and other Ladies of honour, by a sauage cru∣elty,
caused them in his presence to be dismembred and cut in
péeces. During the time of the sacking (which continued thrée
daies) there was no kinde of fornication, Sodometry, sacrilege,
nor cruelty, by them left vnexecuted.</P>
<P>They spoiled the incomparable Temple of <HI>S. Sophia</HI> (which
was built by the Emperour <HI>Iustinian</HI>) of all ornaments and hal∣lowed
vessels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temple of <HI>S. Sophia</HI> was made a stewes.</NOTE> and made thereof a stable, and a brodell for bug∣gerers
and whores.</P>
<P>This lamentable losse of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> being chiefe of the
Orientall Empire, and likewise of the City of <HI>Perah,</HI> by the
<HI>Turkes</HI> called <HI>Gallata,</HI> being the seat of trade of the <HI>Geneuoises,</HI>
lying hard by <HI>Constantinople,</HI> vpon the other side of the Cha∣nell,
was in the yéere of our Sauiour 1453. March 29. (some
doe say of Aprill, and others of May) after it had remained vn∣der
the dominion of the Christians 1198. yéeres.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21"/>
But this is a maruellous thing, and worthy to be noted, that
<HI>Constantinople</HI> being reedified and new set vp by <HI>Constantine</HI>
the sonne of <HI>S. Helene</HI> (whom some report to haue beene an En∣glishwoman
borne at <HI>Cholchester</HI>) after the proportion and like∣nesse
of <HI>Rome,</HI> was by another <HI>Constantine,</HI> sonne of another
<HI>Helene,</HI> taken, sacked, and brought into the hands of the
<HI>Turkes,</HI> which foreuer is like to be (in the iudgement of man)
an irreparable dammage vnto al Christendome. Yet the Turks
haue a Prophecie, that as the Empire was gotten by <HI>Maho∣met,</HI>
so by another of that name <HI>Mahomet</HI> it shall be lost againe.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet,</HI> after hée had thus taken the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The policie of Mahomet.</NOTE> resoluing to
kéepe there the seat of his Empire, caused (with all diligence)
the wals to be new made, and certaine other ruinated places to
be repaired. And in stead of the great number of the people that
were there slaine and carried away as prisoners, he caused to be
brought thither, out of all the Prouinces and Cities by him con∣quered,
a certaine number of men, women, and children, with
their faculties and riches, whom he permitted there to liue ac∣cording
to the institutions and precepts of such Religion as it
pleased them to obserue, and to exercise with all safety, their
handicrafts and merchandises; which ministred an occasion
vnto an infinite multitude of <HI>Iewes</HI> and <HI>Marannes,</HI> driuen out
of <HI>Spaine,</HI> for to come and dwell there: By meanes whereof, in
very short time the City began to increase in trafficke, riches,
and abundance of people.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mahomet</HI> was the first founder of the great <HI>Seralia</HI>
(where the great Turke now vsually dwelleth) which he buil∣ded
at the entry of the channell, about one of the corners of the
City, vpon the <HI>Promontorie Chrisoseras,</HI> which afterwards by
the great Turkes which successiuely haue dwelled there, hath
béene greatly beautified and augmented.</P>
<P>He sounded likewise vpon one of the Mounts of the same
City, a sumptuous <HI>Muskia</HI> or Church, with an <HI>Amarathe</HI> and
College, enduing them all with great yéerely reuennues: which
is not to be maruelled at, for fortune was so fauourable vnto
him, that after he had ruinated the Empire of <HI>Constantinople</HI>
and <HI>Trapezonde,</HI> he tooke from the Christians 12. Kingdomes,
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
and 200. Cities; so that, by reason of his great prowesses and
Conquests, the name and title of <HI>[Great]</HI> was giuen vnto him,
and to this day remaineth vnto the house of the <HI>Ottomans:</HI> As
the Turke who died about foure yéeres since, was called <HI>Sultan
Mahomet,</HI> the <HI>Grand Chan</HI> of <HI>Turkey,</HI> and the fourtéenth of the
Line of <HI>Ottoman.</HI> And his sonne which now raigneth (being
not yet aboue twenty yéeres of age) is called <HI>Sultan Achomet</HI>
the fifteenth <HI>Grand Chan</HI> of the Line of <HI>Ottoman:</HI> and writeth
himselfe also (as his Predecessors haue done) King of the blacke
and white Seas, and of the holy Cities <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem:</HI>
<Q><L>Proijcit ampullas &amp; sesquipedalia verba:</L></Q>

<P>Ouer against <HI>Constantinople</HI> about the <HI>Seralia</HI> point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perah or Gallata.</NOTE> on the
other side the water, there is another City called <HI>Gallata</HI> or <HI>Pe∣rah,</HI>
which (in ancient time) was called <HI>Cornubizantij.</HI> It is a
City of great antiquity, builded by the <HI>Genoezes.</HI> It is called
by the <HI>Greekes</HI> vulgarly <HI>Perah,</HI> which is a Gréeke word, signi∣fying

<HEAD>Of fearfull fires and terrible Earth-quakes,
which haue happened within
Constantinople.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ZOnoras</HI> the <HI>Constantinopolitan Historian</HI> maketh mention
in his Histories, of two fearfull fires which happened vn∣to
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> whereof the first was in the time and Em∣pire
of <HI>Leon</HI> the great, spreading it selfe from the North vnto
the South, along by <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> to wit, the length of one of the
Seas to the other, and was so horrible and furious for the space
of foure daies, that it deuoured and brought to ashes the whole
beauty of the City, namely, the place where the Senate and
Citizens (chosen to deliberate vpon common affaires) did as∣semble.
There was also burned another princely house, and a
<PB N="25" REF="22"/>
Pallace ioyning vnto the caue or den called <HI>Nymphee,</HI> and di∣uers
other Churches and priuate houses.</P>

<HEAD>Of two fearefull Earth-quakes which hap∣pened
to CONSTANTINOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE said <HI>Zonoras</HI> reciteth, that during the raigne of <HI>Ana∣stasius</HI>
chosen vnto the Empire of the East parts, there hap∣pened
such a great earthquake, that it ruined euen to the foun∣dations,
a great number of buildings, not onely at <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI>
but likewise in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> and other places thereabout.</P>
<P>But the last (whereof diuers worthy Authors haue written,
namely <HI>Munster</HI> in his <HI>Geographie</HI>) was so strange &amp; fearefull
for the space of 18. dayes continually, that with horrible feare∣fulnesse
&amp; dammage, it cast downe to the ground the walles of
the Citie, and all the buildings towards the sea side, and ouer∣threw
all the ditches. It did also cast downe the Tower
where the Turk kept his munition, with fiue others more. The
house of Tribute which stoode néere vnto the walle, was ouer∣throwen
euen to the foundation into the sea, with the Leadings
of the waters and conduits, which, with incredible expences
had beene made to leade the waters out of the <HI>Danube</HI> into the
<PB N="26" REF="23"/>
Citie, were for the most part broken and bruised. And the
chanell which is betwixt <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Perah</HI> was so mo∣ued,
that by great surges it cast the water ouer the walles of
both the Cities.</P>
<P>But the worst of all was, that more then 13000. persons
remained dead on an heape. This great Earthquake happe∣ned
in the moneth of September, in the yeere of grace 1509.

Emperour vnto the Turkes (which succéeded <HI>Mahomet</HI> the se∣cond)
who, with all diligence caused the walles of the Citie to

<P>The rest of the noble Antiquities which presently are to be

Emperours made the horses to run for the pleasure and dele∣ctation
of the people, which beheld the same vpon a stage or

which were too long to set downe. But these <HI>Bezestans</HI> are not
open all the day, but at certaine houres, vz. from nine of the
clocke in the morning, to three or foure in the afternoone; and not
euery day neither, but on certaine daies in the wéeke.</P>
<P>There is also a vsual market in <HI>Constantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Markets of men.</NOTE> wherein they
sell men and women of all ages as ordinarily as we doe cattle in
England, which are (for the most part) Christians, such as the
<HI>Turkes</HI> take captiues in <HI>Hungarie</HI> or other places where they
ouercome: Their custome is to make slaues of all they can take
aliue, and (at their returne) to sell them in the open market.
If Christians be moued in compassion to buy them, because they
are Christians, the <HI>Turkes</HI> will sell them excéeding deare to
them, but cheape to a <HI>Musslelman</HI> (as they call themselues) that
is, <HI>true beleeuers.</HI> But if they cannot get their owne price for
them, they will enforce them to turne <HI>Turks,</HI> and to serue them
in all seruile labours as the <HI>Israelites</HI> did the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>

the kéeping whereof, there is a Captaine called <HI>Disdaragla,</HI> a

commeth thither very seldome. This Castle also with
<PB N="28" REF="24"/>
seuen Towers (commonly called <HI>The seuen Towers</HI>) is a Pri∣son
for great men, like vnto the Tower of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>There are also two other strong Castles which I haue séene
towards the Blacke Sea (called <HI>Mare Euxinum</HI>) wherinto they
put prisoners of whom they make great account, and for whom
they expect great ransome.</P>
<P>At the Blacke sea we saw <HI>Pompeis</HI> Piller of marble, erected
one a rocky Iland, neere vnto the shoare, whereon some of our
company wrote their names, <HI>viz.</HI> master <HI>Robert Yong,</HI> Gentle∣man
(who also there wrote the name of our noble Prince <HI>HENRY</HI>)
<LIST>
<ITEM>Nathaniel Persiuall.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Iohn Milwarde.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thomas Marson,</HI> and others.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And on the shoare néere vnto the Blacke Sea, there is a Lant∣horne
as high as stéeple, and on the top thereof a great pan of
liquor, in darke nights continually burning to giue warning to
ships how néere they approach vnto the shoare. For it is a very
dangerous shoare, and it is therefore called the Blacke Sea, not
because the waters thereof are any whit blacker then others,
but from the dangerous euents, because in blacke and darke
nights many ships are cast away, rushing either vpon rockes or
sands: as the Red Sea also in <HI>Egypt</HI> is not therefore called the
Red Sea, because the waters thereof are redder than others,
but (as some thinke) because the waters were turned into blood
when <HI>Moses</HI> wrought miracles before <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> But this rea∣son
I doe not so well approue, because we doe not reade that
the sea was turned into blood, but the Riuers, so that they could
not drinke of the Riuers, nor the Fish liue therein. But I like
better of their iudgement who say it is called the Red Sea, be∣cause
of the red grauell and red bull-rushes which still grow in
great abundance by the shoare thereof.</P>
<P>The Blacke sea is not farre from <HI>Constantinople;</HI> for we tooke
boat from thence in the morning, and were at the Blacke Sea
before noone, &amp; hauing séene <HI>Pompeis</HI> piller, we went on shoare,
and tooke wine and other victuals with vs vp into the Lanthorn
and there dined, and returned to <HI>Constantinople</HI> by Supper

My brother <HI>Peter Biddulph</HI> in right humble manner saluteth
you, and that vertuous Gentle-woman your wife. I vnder∣stand
by a Letter which I lately receiued from him dated at <HI>An∣chona,</HI>
that he had béene at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the yéere of <HI>Iubile:</HI> but at
this present he is either in <HI>Venice</HI> or in some other principal City
in <HI>Italy,</HI> where hée cutteth <HI>Diamonds, Rubies, Saphiers, Emrods,</HI>
and all other sorts of precious stones. I wrote for him to come
vnto me to <HI>Aleppo</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> to bée factor for a worshipfull Mer∣chant
of our Company: but he answered me that he had learned
not to be another mans man so long as he could be his owne, ac∣cording
to that versicle.</P>
<Q><L>Alterius non sit, qui suus esse potest.</L></Q>
<P>that is:</P>
<Q><L>Let not him a mans seruants be,</L>
<L>Who can liue well, and may be free.</L></Q>
<P>Whereby I perceiued that his purpose was to follow the trade
of a <HI>Lapidarie,</HI> and buying and selling precious stones, which he
buyeth rough and rouged: and when he hath smoothed them, and
curiously wrought them, then he selleth them againe. Yet I
expect his comming hither before many yéeres be expired: for I
vnderstand he hath a purpose to trauell to <HI>Spahan</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> and
to other of the chiefest Cities there to buy precious stones, which
are brought thither from <HI>India</HI> and other places. And his direct
way thither is to trauell thorow <HI>Siria,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Baby∣lon</HI>
in <HI>Assyria;</HI> wherefore I make account he will visit me in his
iourney thither. And I doubt not but hee will salute you with
many letters before his departure out of Christendome; for he
writeth vnto mee that you by your kindnesse haue bound him
vnto you in bond of perpetuall gratefulnesse; which, though he
be vnable to requite, yet hée is not vnwilling to record. Hée
hath béene in most of the chiefest Cities in <HI>Italy, Germany,</HI> and
the low Countries, and in <HI>Geneua, Sauoy, Spaine,</HI> and in all
the chiefe Cities of <HI>France;</HI> and is better able to acquaint you

you for satisfaction of your expectation therein.</P>
<P>Many other matters I haue to acquaint you withal, concer∣ning
the manners, gouernement, Religion and discipline of the

any further to sillicite you. Of the rest,
heereafter (if God permit.) If you write héere∣after

<HEAD>A LETTER WRITTEN
from Aleppo in Syria Comagena, wherein
is discoursed of a voyage from Constantinople
to Syria, with such memorable matters as were obser∣ued

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Salutem in Christo, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lbeit (deare friend) since my com∣ming
into <HI>Syria</HI> (which is now
2. yeres fully expired) I haue not
as yet saluted you with any let∣ters
(notwithstanding your of∣ten
prouoking of mée by your let∣ters
to more diligence in wri∣ting)
yet I pray you impute it
not vnto mée for vngratefulnesse
or forgetfulnesse: for no continu∣ance
of time, or distance of place,
shall make mée forget you. For although I am now many
thousand miles distant from you, yet I haue changed but the
aire, I remaine still the same man, and of the same minde, ac∣cording
to that old verse, though spoken in another sense,</P>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="26"/>
<L>Coelum, non animos mutant qui trans mare currunt.</L></Q>
<P>That is,</P>
<Q><L>They that ouer the sea from place to place doe passe,</L>
<L>Change but the aire, their minde is as it was.</L></Q>
<P>And God forbid I should forget you: for I haue learned,
that he who hath deserued well, ought not to be forgotten, but
with all duties of loue and kindnesse remembred and regarded.
And that foule vice of ingratitude I haue alwaies abhorred;
yea the very suspicion thereof I haue euer detested, as a vice
most odious and detestable both to God and all good men.
Wherefore if all loue require loue againe, I were most vnkind
if I would not requite your loue towards me, with mutuall
loue and gratefull memorie. But the cause of my long silence
hath béene, rather a desire to sée you in presence, than to salute
you in absence: for I am weary of this vncomfortable Coun∣try,
and did thinke of haue repaired towards my natiue Coun∣try
long before this time, which I desire as earnestly to sée, as
<HI>Vlysses</HI> did to sée the smoake of his Country before he died; and
pray with the banished man in his Exile,
<Q><L>Sedibus in patrijs det mihi posse mori.</L></Q>
<Q><L>God grant I may die in my owne Country.</L></Q>
Yet when I remember how the Heathen man could comfort

doe comfort my selfe with this confidence, that he which broght
<HI>Iacob</HI> from <HI>Padan Aram</HI> in <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> to his owne countrey
in safety, after twenty yéeres seruice; and <HI>Naomi</HI> after ten
yéers soiourning in idolatrous <HI>Moab,</HI> to <HI>Bethlehem Ephrata</HI> her

from this Heathenish <HI>Babylon,</HI> to <HI>Israel</HI> his people, and En∣glish
<HI>Sion,</HI> where, with the true <HI>Israelites,</HI> the remembrance of
<HI>Babylon</HI> will make me sing more swéetly in <HI>Sion.</HI> In the meane
time, though I want the swéet society, comfort and conference
of you and other my kinde friends (whose remembrance is com∣fortable
vnto me) yet I will not cease by writing to supply that
<PB N="37" REF="26"/>
duty which I cannot performe by speaking, hoping and expe∣cting
the like from you; for nothing can be more comfortable to
me in this strange countrey, than often to heare from my
friends, and by mutuall writing to be acquainted with the af∣faires
of each other.</P>
<P>The dolefull and lamentable beginning of your last letter
made me excéeding sorrowfull;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queene <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> was fa∣mous throgh∣out the whole world, &amp; her death bewa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣led by hea∣then people.</NOTE> for therein you acquainted me
with the death of blessed Quéene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of late and famous

Nation mourned, but many other Christians who were neuer
in Christendome, but borne and brought vp in Heathen coun∣tries,
wept to heare of her death, and said she was the most fa∣mous
Quéene that euer they heard or read of since the world
began.</P>
<P>But the ending of your letter comforted vs againe, and mi∣tigated
our mourning, and gaue vs occasion to vse that verse
of <HI>Sybill</HI> concerning the branch of the holy trée, <HI>Virg. Aenid li.</HI> 6.

<P>And (as my duty was) I appointed one day to be kept holy,
which we spent in praier, and preaching, and thanksgiuing vn∣to
God for the happy aduancement of so noble, wise, learned,

partakers with vs of our ioy. And I beséech God continue such
ioyfull daies vnto our Land so long as the Sunne and Moone

<P>Now, because the nature of man is desirous of newes, and
(as it is said) the first question of an Englishman, <HI>What newes?</HI>
I know you expect from me to heare of such newes as this coun∣try
affoordeth. Wherefore (in some measure to satisfie your
expectation) as in my former letters directed to you from <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
I acquainted you with my voyage thither, and
<PB N="34" REF="27"/>
such Antiquities and memorable matters as I saw and obser∣ued
there, so the Subiect of this present letter shal be my Voyage
from <HI>Thracia</HI> to <HI>Syria,</HI> with such obseruable circumstances as
I haue noted there since my comming into this countrey.</P>
<P>And first of all I giue you to vnderstand, that after my depar∣ture
from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the first place we touched at, was the
2. Castles at the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> about 220. miles distant frō <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
where the order is, for all ships to stay thrée daies,
to the end that if any slaues be run away from their masters, or
théeues haue stollen away any thing, they may thither be pur∣sued
in thrée daies, before the ships passe: And then at thrée
daies end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That is, good for∣bidden.</NOTE> the ship must be searched for goods <HI>contra bando,</HI> and
the Grand-signiors Passe shewed for all the passengers in the
ship; and then (their vsuall duties paied) they may set saile and
away. Yet if the master of the ship pay extraordinarily, they
may more spéedily be dispatched: and many giue very liberally
(when they haue a good winde) rather than they will be staied
many houres.</P>
<P>From thence we sailed betwéene <HI>Moeotis</HI> and <HI>Tenedos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pontus.</NOTE> in
the sea called <HI>Pontus.</HI> For although sometime in the Poets, e∣uery
sea be called <HI>Pontus</HI> (as <HI>Ouid</HI> in his Booke <HI>De Tristibus</HI>

an <HI>Ile</HI> in the middest betwixt <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Creet.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Rhodes</HI> we came to <HI>Cyprus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyprus.</NOTE> a famous and fruitfull
<HI>Iland</HI> in the sea <HI>Carpathium.</HI> betwéene <HI>Cilicia</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> which

But the chiefest Cities in <HI>Cyprus</HI> are <HI>Famogusta</HI> and <HI>Nico∣sia.</HI>
There is great store of cotten-woollgrowing in this <HI>Iland,</HI>
and exceeding good wine made héere, and the best dimetey, with
other good commodities. From hence a French Gentleman
(who came in our ship from <HI>Constantinople</HI>) imbarked himselfe
for <HI>Ioppa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioppa</NOTE> with a purpose to goe to <HI>Ierusalem. Ioppa</HI> is not two
daies sailing from <HI>Cyprus</HI> with a good winde: and <HI>Ioppa</HI> is but

of the Signiory of <HI>Venice;</HI> but now it is inhabited by
<HI>Greekes,</HI> and gouerned by <HI>Turkes.</HI></P>
<P>But our Ship from <HI>Cyprus</HI> went to <HI>Tripoly</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tripoly in Syria.</NOTE> a City
on the maine land of <HI>Syria,</HI> néere vnto <HI>Mount Lybanus,</HI> which
is a mountaine of thrée daies iourney in length, reaching from

at <HI>Tripoly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lybanus</NOTE> I and some others rode vp to <HI>Mount Lybanus</HI> to sée
the Cedartrées there, and lodged the first night at the Bishops
house of <HI>Eden,</HI> who vsed vs very kindly. It is but a little vil∣lage,
and called by the <HI>Turkes, Anchora,</HI> but most vsually by
the Christians there dwelling it is called <HI>Eden,</HI> not the garden
of <HI>Eden,</HI> (which place is vnknowen vnto this day) but because
it is a pleasant place, resembling in some sort the garden of <HI>Eden</HI>
(as the simple inhabitants thereof suppose) therefore it is called
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
<HI>Eden.</HI> This Bishop was borne in the same parish, but brought
vp at <HI>Rome:</HI> his name was <HI>Franciscus Amyra,</HI> by whom I vn∣derstood,
that the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> many yéeres since sent vnto
the Christians inhabiting <HI>Mount Lybanus,</HI> to perswade them
to embrace the <HI>Romish Religion,</HI> and yéeld themselues to the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> making large promises vnto them if they
would so doe: whereof they deliberated long, but in the end
yéelded, vpon condition they might haue liberty to vse their
owne Liturgie, and Ceremonies, and Lents (for they strictly
obserue foure Lents in the yéere) and other customes. Euer
since which time, the Pope hath and doth maintaine some of
their children at <HI>Rome.</HI> These Christians which dwell vpon
<HI>Mount Lybanus,</HI> are called <HI>Maronites:</HI> they are very simple and
ignorant people, yet ciuill, kinde, and curteous to strangers.
There are also many <HI>Turkes</HI> dwelling on the same mountaine,
and an <HI>Emeer</HI> or great Lord, called <HI>Emeer Vseph,</HI> who gouer∣neth
all the rest, both Christians and Turkes, being himselfe a
<HI>Mahometan,</HI> yet one who holdeth the gouernment of <HI>Mount Ly∣banus</HI>
in despight of the great <HI>Turke,</HI> and hath done a long
time.</P>
<P>From <HI>Eden</HI> we rode ten miles further vp the mountaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cedars were plentifull in Solomans time, but none very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are.</NOTE> to
sée certaine Cedar trees, where we saw 24. tall Cedar trées
growing together, as bigge as the greatest oakes, with diuers
rowes of branches one ouer another, stretching straight out, as
though they were kept by Art. Although we read of great store of
Cedars which haue growen on <HI>Mount Lybanus,</HI> yet now there
are very few, for we saw none but these 24. neither heard of
any other but in one place more. At these Cedars many <HI>No∣stranes</HI>
met vs, and led vs to their villages.</P>
<P>From these Cedars we returned towards <HI>Tripoly</HI> another
way, descending by the side of the Mount towards a village of
the <HI>Maroniticall Christians,</HI> called <HI>Hatcheeth,</HI> where (as we were
descending downe the side of the Mountaine) all the men, wo∣men,
and children, came out of their houses to behold vs: And
when we were yet farre off riding towards them, they gaue
a ioifull shout all together iointly, to expresse their ioy for our
comming. And when we came néere, their women with chaf∣fingdishes
<PB N="35" REF="28"/>
of coales burnt incense in our way, and their <HI>Cassee∣ses,</HI>
that is, their Churchmen (with blew shashes about their
heads) made crosses with their fingers towards vs (as their
manner is in signe of welcome) and blessed vs, giuing God
thankes that he had brought Christian Frankes (that is, free∣men)
of such farre countries as they vnderstood we were of, to
come to visit them.</P>
<P>So soone as we were dismounted from our horses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shch, signi∣fieth an an∣cient man.</NOTE> the chiefe
<HI>Sheh,</HI> with all the rest of their ancientest men, came and brought
vs to the chiefe house of the parish, called the <HI>Townehouse</HI> or
<HI>Church-house,</HI> and there spread carpets and table-cloathes on
the ground (as their manner is) and made vs all sit downe; and
euery one that was able, brought flaskets of such good chéere
as they had, to welcome vs, which was many bottles or in∣gesters
of excéeding good wine, with oliues, sallets, egges, and
such like things, as on the sudden they had ready, and set them
before vs; and both by the chéerefulnesse of their countenan∣ces,
gestures of their bodies, and presents of such present
things as they had, expressed their gladnesse for our comming;
and would also haue prepared hens, kids, and other good chéere,
but we would not suffer them. This was about 11. or 12. of
the clocke. They would haue had vs continue with them all
night, and with great importunity craued it; but we vnder∣standing
that the Patriarch was but thrée miles off, at a vil∣lage
called <HI>Sharry,</HI> we went to salute him, who hearing of our
comming (albeit he were at a feast amongst all his neighbours)
came to méet vs, and saluted vs, and brought vs all in amongst
his neighbours into a roome fouresquare, and round about be∣set
with carpets and table-cloathes on the ground, and such
chéere as the season of the yéere did affoord, set thereon, and
made vs all sit downe, and conferred with vs of our countrey,
and many other matters, sauing matters of Religion, for the
poore man had no Latine, and little learning in any other Lan∣guage;
only he had the Syriac (which was his naturall lan∣guage)
with the Turkish and Arabian t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngue. After wée had
spent one houre with him, we left him with his neighbours at
<HI>Sharry,</HI> where wée found him, for hée could not conueniently
<PB N="38" REF="29"/>
come from them: for their manner is, when they feast, to sit
from midday vntill midnight, and sometimes all night, neuer
all together rising from their good chéere, but now and then one
by intercourses, as occasion requireth, returning againe spéedi∣ly.
Yet he sent with vs three men to bring vs to his own house
neere vnto a village (foure miles distant from <HI>Sharry</HI>) called <HI>Bo∣loza,</HI>
but vulga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <HI>Blouza,</HI> from whence we descended downe
the side of another part of the mountaine, and in the middle of
the descending of this mountaine was the Patriarkes house,
called <HI>Kanobeen kadischa Mir-iam</HI> in the Syria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tongue, but in
Latine, <HI>Coenobium sanctae Mariae;</HI> that is, <HI>The Monasterie of
Saint Mary.</HI> Ouer against the Patriarkes house is an high stée∣py
mountaine, from whence the water runneth downe into a
déepe valley betwixt the Patriarkes house and the hill, and in
the fall, the water maketh an excéeding great noise, like vnto
that <HI>Catadupa</HI> in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> where the fall of <HI>Nilus</HI> maketh such
a noise, that the people are made deafe therewith that dwell
neere it. This place is somewhat like vnto it in fall, but not in
effect: for this water being not so great as <HI>Nilus,</HI> maketh not
the like noise, neither worketh the like effect. There is also an
extraordinary <HI>Eccho</HI> thereabout.</P>
<P>One side of the Patriarkes house is a naturall rocke, the o∣ther
of hewen stones and squared timber: a very strong house,
but not very large, nor spetious to behold. So are also many
of their houses, in most of their villages, built against a rocke,
as a wall vnto one side of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That is, Lord Ioseph.</NOTE> especially <HI>Emeer Vseph</HI> his house,
the greatest part thereof being hewed out of the liuely rocke,
and the passage or descending vnto it so narrow and dangerous,
that it is counted inuincible, which maketh him to hold out
against the <HI>Turke,</HI> and to dominéere in this mountaine, will he,
nill he.</P>
<P>It is a most intricate mountaine with hilles and valleyes,
woods and riuers, and fruitfull pastures, oliues, vines, and
figtrees, goates, shéepe, and other cattle. It is also excéeding
high, hauing snow on the top all the yéere long.</P>
<P>At this Monastery of S. <HI>Mary</HI> (which is the Patriarches
house) we lodged all night, and both on Saterday at Euening
<PB N="39" REF="29"/>
Praier, and on Sunday of morning Praier, we both heard and
sawe the manner of their Seruice in the <HI>Syriac</HI> tongue, both
read and sung very reuerently, with Confessions, Praiers,
Thankesgiuings, the Psalmes of <HI>Dauid</HI> sung, and Chapters
both out of the old Testament and the new distinctly read. It
reioyced me greatly to see their order: and I obserued in these
ancient Christians called <HI>Nazarites,</HI> the antiquitie of vsing set
formes of Praiers in Churches, and also the necessitie thereof,
that the people might haue something to say Amen vnto, being
read in their mother tongue, that they may learne to pray priua∣tely
by those Praiers which they daily heare read publikely.
This is too much neglected in <HI>England,</HI> God grant reformation
thereof.</P>
<P>There is no place in all the world but foure parishes or villa∣ges
on this mountaine where they speake the <HI>Syriac</HI> tongue na∣turally
at this day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But 4. Pari∣shes in all the world which speake Syriac.</NOTE> And these are these foure villages, which

<P>There are dwelling on one side of mount <HI>Lybanus</HI> towards

to remoue, after the manner of the ancient <HI>Israelites:</HI> and where
they finde good pasture, there they pitch their tents; the men fol∣lowing

keepe their tents, and spend their time in spinning, or carding,
or knitting, or some houshold huswifery, not spending their
time in gossipping and gadding abroade from place to place, and
from house to house, from ale-house to wine tauerne, as many
idle huswies in <HI>England</HI> doe.</P>
<P>Yet sometimes are these simple soules abused by <HI>Ianisaries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ianisaries, are souldiers.</NOTE>
who in trauailing by them take from them perforce victuals for

<P>We returned from mount <HI>Lybanus</HI> to <HI>Tripoly</HI> by such an in∣tricate
way, that if we had not had a guide with vs, we should
haue lost our selues.</P>
<P>Néere vnto <HI>Tripoly</HI> there is a plaine at least one mile in length,
full of Oliue trées and Figge trées.</P>
<P>At the foote of this mountaine, néere vnto <HI>Tripoly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A mountaine of sand.</NOTE> there is a

<P>And now thirdly, a mile from the sea, where it is annoyed

<P>Our ship being not ready to set saile at our returne from the

<PB N="37" REF="30"/>
for a good wind; we trauailed by land two daies iourney,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrus and Sidon.</NOTE> to see
<HI>Tyrus</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> hard by the sea. And at <HI>Sidon</HI> wée saw the

<P><HI>Tyrus</HI> is now called (by the Turkes) <HI>Sur,</HI> because there be∣ginneth
the land of <HI>Siria,</HI> which they call <HI>Sur; Tyrus</HI> is destroy∣ed,
and no such Citie now standing, onely the name of the place
remaineth, and the place is still knowen where it stood. Eight
miles from <HI>Tyrus</HI> towards the East is the Citie <HI>Sarepta▪</HI> of the
<HI>Sidonians,</HI> where the Prophet <HI>Elias</HI> raised the Widowes sonne
from death to life.</P>
<P>We saw also <HI>Baruta,</HI> where somtimes was a great trade for
Merchants, but from thence they remooued it to <HI>Damascus,</HI> and
from <HI>Damascus</HI> to <HI>Tripoly,</HI> and of late, from <HI>Tripoly</HI> to <HI>Sidon.
Ioppa</HI> is not farre from these parts, oftentimes Barkes come

<P>At our returne wee went aboard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scanderon.</NOTE> and presently set saile for
<HI>Scanderone,</HI> (as it is now called by Turks:) otherwise called <HI>A∣lexandretta</HI>
by the Christians, which is the very bottome and
vtmost border of all the straights. The ayre is very corrupt,
and infecteth the bodies, and corrupteth the blood of such as con∣tinue
there many daies, partly by reason of the dregs of the sea,
which are driuen thither: and partly by reason of two high
mountaines which keepe a way the sunne from it a great part of
the day. And it is very dangerous for strangers to come on
shoare before the sunne be two houres high, and haue dried vp
the vapors of the ground, or to stay on shoare after sunne set∣ting.
The waters also néere vnto the towne are very vnhol∣some,
comming from a moorish ground; but at the fountaine, a
mile off, there is excéeding good water to drinke. It is far more
healthfull to sléepe aboard then on the shoare.</P>
<P><HI>Scanderone</HI> is in <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and <HI>Cilicia</HI> is the countrie <HI>Caramo∣nia,</HI>

<P>At the gardens neere <HI>Tarsus</HI> (and likewise at other gardens
within three miles of <HI>Scanderone</HI>) we saw great store of Silke∣wormes,
which at the first bee but little graines like vnto Mu∣stardseed:
but by the bearing of them in womens bosomes, they
doe gather an heat, whereby they come vnto life, and so proue
wormes; they kéepe them in tents made of réeds with one loft
ouer another full of them, and féed them with leaues of Mulbe∣ry
trées; these wormes (by naturall instinct) doe fast often,
(as some report) euery third day.</P>
<P>Heere we staied certaine dayes to auoid the infection of <HI>Scan∣derone.</HI>
The mountaines which obscure <HI>Scanderone,</HI> and make
it more vnhealthfull, I take to be a part of <HI>Taurus,</HI> which is a
great and famous Mountaine, beginning at the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea,
and rising into the North, passeth by <HI>Asia</HI> vnto <HI>Moeotis,</HI> borde∣ring
vpon many Countries, and is called by many names.
Sometimes it is called <HI>Caucasus,</HI> which is the highest hill in all
<HI>Asia,</HI> which parteth <HI>Jndia</HI> from <HI>Scythia,</HI> and is part of the hill
<HI>Taurus.</HI> Sometimes it is called <HI>Amanus,</HI> which hill parteth <HI>Sy∣ria</HI>
from <HI>Cilicia.</HI> And sometimes it is called by other names, ac∣cording
vnto the sea coasts along which it extendeth.</P>
<P>About <HI>Scanderone</HI> there are many rauenous beasts about
the bignesse of a For, commonly called there <HI>Iackalles,</HI> engen∣dered
(as they say) of a Fox and a Woolfe, which in the night
make a great crying, and come to the graues, and if there haue
béene any corse buried the day before, (if the graue be not well
filled, with many great stones vpon it) many of them together,
with their feet, doe scrape vp the earth, and pull vp the corps
and eat it.</P>

<P>Our Merchants and passengers making haste to bee gone

an ancient towne about 25. miles from <HI>Scanderone,</HI> mentioned

Héere we lodged in an house, but on the bare ground, hauing
nothing to sléepe on, or to couer vs, but what we brought with
vs, <HI>viz.</HI> a pillow, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a quilt at the most, and that was lodging

<P>This <HI>Antioch</HI> hath beene, as a famous, so an excéeding strong
Towne, situated by the Sea, and almost compassed (at the least
on both sides) with excéeding high and strong rockes. The In∣habitants
at this day are Gréekes, but vnder the gouernement
<PB N="40" REF="32"/>
of the Turke, but for matters of Religion, ordered and ruled by
their Patriarchs, for the Gréeks haue foure Patriarchs to this
present day, <HI>viz.</HI> The Patriarch of <HI>Antioch,</HI> the Patriarch of
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the Patriarch of <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
who ruleth all the rest. Yet as the Iewes, so also
the Greekes to this day are without a king, and both they, and
their Patriarks are but slaues to the great Turke.</P>
<P>And although their Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople</HI> bee counted
their chiefe Patriarch: yet I haue knowen one <HI>Milesius</HI> (a lear∣ned
man indéed) who was first Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
preferred to the place by master <HI>Edward Barton,</HI> an English
Gentleman, and Lord Ambassadour for Quéene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of
famous memorie, (and the mirror of all Ambassadours that e∣uer
came to <HI>Constantinople</HI>) who for his wisedome, good gouern∣ment,
policie, and Christian cariage hath left an immortal fame
behind him in those Countries, to this present day, and lieth
buried at an Iland of the Gréeks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bartons Iland.</NOTE> within twelue miles of <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI>
called <HI>Bartons</HI> Iland to this day.</P>
<P>After whose death, this good man <HI>Milesius</HI> was by the Gréeks
displaced from being Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> (which they
durst not doe whiles master <HI>Barton</HI> was liuing) because, being
a man of knowledge, he laboured to reforme the Greekes from
many of their superstitious customes. Whereupon (presently
after the death of master <HI>Barton</HI>) they said their Patriarch was
an Englishman, and no Gréeke, and therefore Manzulled him,
that is: displaced him. Yet bearing some reuerence towards
him for his learning, made him Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> And
being there Patriarch, he excommunicated the Patriarch of <HI>An∣tiochia,</HI>
because he accepted of reliefe at the Popes hand; and
made him come to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> to humble himselfe vnto him,
and acknowledge his fault before he would suffer him to exe∣cute
his Patriarkes office.</P>
<P>Master <HI>Henry Lello</HI> (a learned, wise, and religious English
gentleman, sometime student in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and afterwards at
the Innes of the Court) succéeded Master <HI>Barton</HI> in his place,
and in many things excéeded him, especially in his religious
carriage and vnspotted life: and had not the times béene more
<PB N="41" REF="32"/>
troublesome in his regiment, than in the time of his predecessor
Master <HI>Barton;</HI> he would euery way haue gone beyond him.
He first of all reformed his family, and afterwards so ordered
himselfe in his whole carriage, that he credited our Countrey:
and after ten yéeres gouernment of the English Nation there,
he returned into his Countrey with the teares of many, &amp; with
generall good report of al Nations there dwelling or soiourning;
&amp; is worthily by his excellent Maiesty rewarded with Knight∣hood
for his good seruice.</P>
<P>If <HI>Milesius</HI> had liued, this good gentleman would haue re∣stored
him to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as he placed many other Arch∣bishops
both at <HI>Salonica,</HI> (of old called <HI>Thessalonica</HI>) and else∣where.</P>

<P>The second night, in our trauell from <HI>Scanderone,</HI> we lodged

in cakes, after the ancient manner, as <HI>Abraham</HI> entertained

And their custome hath béene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pigions car∣rying letters.</NOTE> and is still sometimes,
when they haue occasion to send some sudden newes from <HI>Ba∣bylon</HI>
to fasten some briefe writing to one of the wings of a
Bagdat or Babylonian pigeon, or about her necke, in such sort
that it may not hinder her flying, and to send her therewith
to bring newes to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> which is at the least ten daies iour∣ney
off: which when I heard at the first, it séemed to me won∣derfull
strange, and almost incredible: but after I vnderstood
how they traine them to it, the strangenesse thereof was dimi∣nished.
For when the hen doue sitteth, or hath yoong ones, they
take the cocke pigeon and put him in a cage, and when the Car∣riers
goe with their camels, they set the pigeon in an open cage
on a camels backe, and when they are a daies iourney or two
from home, set her at liberty, who presently mounteth vp aloft,
and beholding her way, neuer ceaseth flying vntill she come to
her mate; which any of the house perceiuing, looke for some pa∣per
fastned about her, and so in post haste vnderstand speedie
newes. And so by degrees they traine them further &amp; further
to the places of their trafficke. This I haue knowen put in pra∣ctise,
and performed by an English Merchant of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who
in such sort sent a Bagdat pigeon to <HI>Scanderone,</HI> three daies
<PB N="44" REF="34"/>
iourney from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and by her returne, vnderstood when
ships arriued thither, and departed from thence: which séemeth
not vnto me so strange as that which we reade of, performed
by a Cobler of <HI>Rome,</HI> who taught a dawe to speake, and to sa∣lute
the Emperour, as he passed by, with these words, <HI>Salue
Caesar;</HI> which the Emperour hearing, gaue vnto the Cobler a
good reward, and bought his dawe: which another poore man
in <HI>Rome</HI> perceiuing, hoping to get the like reward, tooke vpon
him to teach another daw, the same lesson; and day and night
as he sate at his work vsed still to prattle vnto his daw, and bid
him say, <HI>Salue Caesar:</HI> and when he perceiued he could not make
his daw once frame himself to pronounce those words, he cha∣fing,
rapped him on the bill, and said, <HI>Operam &amp; oleum perdi∣di;</HI>
that is, <HI>I haue lost my labour in vaine:</HI> yet still continued his
diligent endeuour, and by often repeating both <HI>Salue Caesar,</HI>
and <HI>Operam &amp; oleum perdidi,</HI> in the end his daw had learned
both the one and the other, and when the Emperour passed by,
said, <HI>Salue Caesar;</HI> the Emperour answered, <HI>Tales habeo domi
salutatores;</HI> that is, <HI>J haue such saluters inow at home:</HI> where∣upon
the daw replied, <HI>Operam &amp; oleum perdidi:</HI> which the Em∣perour
hearing, bought this daw also, because he had one lesson
more than the other, and rewarded the poore man well for his
labour.</P>
<P>I am bold to write vnto you in absence as pleasantly as I

<P>But to procéed in my discourse and description of <HI>Syria:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of Syria.</NOTE> All
<HI>Syria</HI> of old was called <HI>Aram,</HI> and the <HI>Syrians, Aramites.</HI> But
especially I doe read of thrée of the chiefest Cities in <HI>Syria</HI> called
by the name <HI>Aram:</HI> The first was <HI>Aram Naharaim,</HI> which was
<HI>Mesopotamia;</HI> for <HI>Nahar</HI> in Hebrue signifieth a Riuer, and <HI>Na∣haraim</HI>
is the duall number thereof, signifying two Riuers,
which were <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tygris. Mesopotamia</HI> the Gréeke
word signifieth the same, comming of two Gréeke words, <HI>viz.</HI>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifieth the middle, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifieth a
Riuer: and therefore was it called <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> because it
<PB N="45" REF="34"/>
was situated betwéene two Riuers, that is, <HI>Euphrates</HI> and
<HI>Tygris.</HI></P>
<P>The second was <HI>Aram Damasek,</HI> that is, <HI>Damascus,</HI> which
is still the chiefest City in all <HI>Syria.</HI></P>
<P>The third was called <HI>Aram Sobah,</HI> which some thinke to
haue béene that City which is now called <HI>Aleppo.</HI> And of this
<HI>Aram Sobah</HI> I finde mention made, 2. <HI>Sam</HI> 8. 3. 4. 5. And also
in the title of the sixty Psalme, where mention is made of the
salt valley which is but halfe a daies iourney from <HI>Aleppo,</HI>
which is a very great plaine, without grasse growing on it, the
very sand whereof is good salt naturally: after raine, being dri∣ed
againe by the sunne, they gather it. There is also a little
Iland or mountaine in the midst thereof, plaine on the toppe,
which yéeldeth the best salt.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Iewes</HI> there dwelling, doe also say, that <HI>Aleppo</HI> was
the City <HI>Sepheruaim:</HI> but I thinke it to be a latter City, which

séeme this City <HI>Aleppo</HI> hath often changed her name, and that,

next, of the Religion, Gouernment, Manners, and Customes
of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> and other Nations there dwelling or soiourning.
Wherfore, that I may the better make knowen vnto you their
Religion, I will begin with the first Author thereof, which
was (no doubt) the Deuill, who vsed that false Prophet <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>
as his instrument to broach it abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Diuers Prophets haue foretold of the wickednesse and ty∣rannie
of the</HI> Turkes: <HI>but I will only recite the Prophecie of</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="35"/>
Daniell, chap. 7. 7. <HI>which is very notable, and agréeth especial∣ly
vnto the time when this impiety and tyranny did beginne.</HI>
After this (<HI>saith</HI> Daniel) I saw in the visions by night, and behold,
the fourth beast was fearefull, and terrible, and very strong. It
had great iron teeth; It deuoured, and brake in peeces, and stam∣ped
the residue vnder his feet; and it was vnlike to the beasts that
were before it, for it had ten hornes. <HI>Hitherto spake</HI> Daniel <HI>of
the fourth, that is, the</HI> Romane Empire, <HI>and of the crueltie of
the same, and of the ten Kings in subiection thereunto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now followeth the Prophecie of the Turkish Kingdome, in
these words,</HI> Dan. 7. 8. As I considered the hornes, behold, there
came vp among them another little horne, before whom there
were three of the first hornes pluckt away. And behold, in this
horne were eies like the eies of a man, and a mouth speaking pre∣sumptuous
things.</P>
<P>And afterwards, <HI>verse</HI> 23. <HI>The fourth beast shall be the fourth
Kingdome in the earth, which shall bee vnlike to all the King∣domes,
and shall deuoure the whole earth, and shall tread it
downe, and breake it in peeces. And the ten hornes out of this
Kingdome, are ten Kings that shall rise; and another shall rise af∣ter
them, and he shall be vnlike to the first, and he shall subdue
three Kings, and shall speake words against the most high, and
thinke that he may change times and lawes.</HI> Hitherto <HI>Daniell,</HI>
whose Prophecie the euent hath prooued to be true.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahomets birth and parentage.</NOTE> For <HI>Anno
Dom.</HI> 591. (<HI>Mauritius</HI> then Emperor of the <HI>Romanes</HI> &amp; raining
in <HI>Constantinople</HI>) was <HI>Mahomet</HI> borne in <HI>Arabia,</HI> in a base vil∣lage
called <HI>Itraripia.</HI> His parents were of diuers Nations, and
different in Religion. His father <HI>Abdallas</HI> was an <HI>Arabian:</HI>
His mother <HI>Cadige</HI> a <HI>Iew</HI> both by birth and profession. His pa∣rentage
(according to most Histories) was so meane and base,
that both his birth and infancie remained obscure, and of no
reckoning, till that his riper yéeres (bewraying in him a most
subtill and crafty nature and disposition) did argue some likeli∣hood,
that the sharpnesse and dexterity of his wit would in time
abolish the basenesse and obscurity of his birth. And soone did
he make shew and proofe thereof: for being trained vp of a boy
in the seruice of a rich and wealthy Merchant, by his great in∣dustry
<PB N="48" REF="36"/>
and diligence, he so insinuated and wrought himselfe in∣to
the good fauour and liking both of his master and mistresse,
that when his master died, and had leaft all his wealth and ri∣ches
vnto his wife, she made choise of her seruant <HI>Mahomet</HI>
for her husband, making him Lord and Master both of her per∣son,
and of her substance. The man being thus raised from
base and low degrée, to great wealth and possessions, and ha∣uing
a working and aspiring head, did from thencefoorth plot
and imagine how he might raise himselfe in honour and repu∣tation;
presuming that the greatnesse of his wealth would bée
a fit meane to worke his higher fortunes. Neither was he de∣ceiued
in the expectation of his hope: For consorting himselfe
with one <HI>Sergius</HI> a fugitiue Monke, a notable Heretike of the
<HI>Arrian</HI> Sect (whom he had made bounden vnto him by his
great liberalitie) there grew so strict a league of amity and se∣cret
familiarity betwéene them, that they had many times pri∣uate
conference, how and by what meanes <HI>Mahomet</HI> might
make himselfe way to rise in honour and estimation. After
much consulting and debating of the matter, the best course
which they conceiued to effect their purpose, was to coine a new
kinde of Doctrine and Religion, vnder colour whereof (the
times then being troublesome, the people full of simplicitie and
ignorance, Religion also waring cold, and neglected) they
thought it an easie matter to draw many followers vnto them,
and by that meanes to grow great in the eie and opinion of the
world. Héereupon these two helhounds (one of them being an
Arch enemie vnto Christ and the truth of his Religion, and the
other séeming a méere Atheist or prophane person, neither per∣fect
<HI>Iew,</HI> nor perfect Christian) patched vp a particular doctrine
vnto themselues out of the old and new Testament, deprauing
the sense of both of them, and framing their opinions accor∣ding
to their owne corrupt and wicked affections; they brought
foorth a monstrous and most diuellish Religion, sauouring part∣ly
of <HI>Judaisme,</HI> partly of <HI>Christianity,</HI> and partly of <HI>Arrianisme,</HI>
as I will shew you more particularly in that which followeth:
But first marke (I pray you) how <HI>Daniels</HI> Prophecie (before
set downe) is prooued true.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="36"/>
<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 623. <HI>Herachius</HI> being Emperour, <HI>Mahomet</HI> moo∣ued
sedition, and forthwith the <HI>Saracens</HI> or <HI>Arabians</HI> ioyned to∣gether
these thrée dominions, <HI>Egypt, Syria</HI> and <HI>Aphrica,</HI> which
are the thrée hornes plucked from those ten hornes of the fourth
beast: and <HI>Daniel</HI> ascribeth to this little horne, that is: to the
Turkish Empire, thrée notes whereby it may be knowen.</P>
<P>1. The first whereof is a new Law contrary to the Law of
God. For the <HI>eyes</HI> doe signifie a law subtilly inuented.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The second marke is, Blasphemie against the most high,
which is Christ.</HI> For the mouth speaking words against the true
God, signifieth blasphemies against the Sonne of God.</P>
<P>3. The third note is Crueltie towards the Church; <HI>And hee
shall consume</HI> (saith he) <HI>the Saints of the most high.</HI></P>
<P>4. The fourth is, an endeauour to Abolish the Gospell and
the Church. <HI>Hee shall thinke</HI> (saith hee) <HI>that hee may change
times and lawes.</HI></P>
<P>God would haue this prophecie to be extant for a strengthe∣ning
of the godly against the crueltie of Turks, that when they
should sée the euent to answeare to the prophecie, they might
not be offended at the stumbling blocke of so great persecution,
and of such reuolting from the true Church. And therefore be∣ing
thus forewarned by the Prophet, let vs take heart to our
selues against this Turkish tyranny and wickednesse, especial∣lie
séeing how the euent hath answered to the prophecie. For
there haue foure Monarchies béene one after an other. And
now raigneth a people which are enemies to God, that openly
doeth abolish the Propheticall and Apostolicall Scriptures.
Thus you may see how fully <HI>Daniels</HI> prophecie is fulfilled.</P>
<P>I will now procéed to shew more plainely how the Turkes
began,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Turks began.</NOTE> multiplied, and encreased.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> in his youth, by reason of his pouertie, liued by
theft and robberie. Afterward hauing heaped much riches to∣gether,
he was a souldier among his countrie men the <HI>Arabians,</HI>
vnder <HI>Heraclius.</HI> In the warre he found occasion of principality
and power. For when the <HI>Arabians</HI> being offended with <HI>Hera∣clius</HI>
for denying them their pay, and for his religion had seue∣red
themselues from him, <HI>Mahomet</HI> ioyned himselfe to the an∣gried
<PB N="50" REF="37"/>
souldiers, and stirred vp their minds against their Empe∣rour,
and encouraged them in their defection. Whereupon,
by a certaine company of Souldiers, he was chosen to bee their
Captaine (as they commonly are extolled in euery commotion,
which fauour the wicked enterprise of the rebellious people, and
set vpon the mightie, and gouernours.)</P>
<P>In this new Captaine many could not abide the basenesse of
his birth, nor the odiousnesse of his former life, especially, they
loathed him for a disease he had, which was the falling sicknes.
He therefore to redeeme himselfe from this contempt (which is
an easie matter among the foolish common people) pretended a
diuinitie in his doings, faining himself to enter communication
with God, and so when he talked with him, to be rauished out
of himselfe, and séemed like vnto one afflicted with the falling
sickenesse. And therefore he said plainely (but vntruely) how
he was no more a Captaine, and Prince elected through the fa∣uour
of Souldiers, but a Prophet, and a messenger of Almighty
God, that vnder the shew of Diuinitie, hee might haue all men
the more obedient vnto his words.</P>
<P>But, for as much as he was rude altogether and vnlearned,
hee adioyned vnto himselfe two masters and counsellers that
were Christians: the one whereof was <HI>Sergi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> an <HI>Arrian,</HI> and
the other <HI>John Nestorius,</HI> to whom there came a third who was
a <HI>Iew,</HI> a <HI>Talmudist.</HI> Of which thrée, euery one of them defen∣ded
his seuerall sect.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Mahomet</HI> supposing that hee should not onely
gratifie his companions, but also the more easily allure all nati∣ons
vnto himselfe, receiued all, that is: The pertinacie of <HI>Arius,</HI>
the errour of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> and the vaine inuentions of the <HI>Thalmu∣dist.</HI>
And therefore he receiued from the Iew Circumcision;
from the Christians sundry washings, as it were Baptismes.
And with <HI>Sergius</HI> he denied the Diuinitie of Christ. Now some
worshipped Idols, others were Baptised and somewhat in∣structed
in Christianitie, who, as soone as they had left the Ro∣mane
Emperour for the hatred they bare against him, renoun∣ced
foorthwith the Religion which hee defended, euen after the
example of those ten tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> which reuolting from the
<PB N="51" REF="37"/>
house of <HI>Dauid</HI> vnto <HI>Ieroboam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 12.</NOTE> despised the lawes of their Fa∣thers,
and went from the seruice of the onely true God, vnto the
innocation of deuils.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomets</HI> manner to enlarge and establish his kingdome
was this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Turks increa∣sed.</NOTE> (which also his masters taught him.)</P>
<P>Hee said how God at the first, to mankind sent <HI>Moses;</HI> after
him, Iesus Christ; who were indewed with the power to worke
miracles. But men gaue small héed to them. Therefore he de∣termined
to send <HI>Mahomet,</HI> a warrier without miracles, that
whom miracles had not mooued, weapons might compell.</P>
<P>Hee said, how he was the last messenger, and that after him
none should come; how Christ in the Gospell had prophecied of
him, and how tidings was of him through a wonderfull light,
which passed from <HI>Eua</HI> by succession of kind through all women,
euen to his very mother.</P>
<P>Sée the subtiltie of this dissembler and deceiuer <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
who knowing that hee was destitue altogether of the hea∣uenly
gift to worke miracles; hee fained that hee was sent
with the sword. But this Armed man at the length was van∣quished,
and receiued a soare wound in his mouth, whereby he
lost some of his chéeke téeth, and was throwen into a ditch, and
pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o a shamefull foyle, and that, the very day before hee had
(from the oracle of God) promised victorie to him and his. Yea,
and while he was yet a common thiefe, he was oftentimes bea∣ten
sore of the <HI>Drianites,</HI> whose Cammels he set vpon returning
from <HI>Mecha.</HI></P>
<P>And that Citie which hath him now in honour, sometime ad∣iudged
him vnto death, as a very hurtful théef, and appointed a
reward if any could bring him vnto them, either quicke or dead.</P>
<P>This champion first a théefe, afterwards a seditious souldier,
then a runnagate, after that a Captaine of a rebellious hoste,
perswadeth light heads, enemies to the true Religion, how hée
is the messenger of God; whereby wee may gather how great
the power of Satan is in them, which imbrace not the truth.
Whereof it is, that at this day that aduersarie of God defen∣deth
his blasphemies against God, by Turkish and <HI>Mahometi∣call</HI>
force, according to the prophecie of <HI>Daniel.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="52" REF="38"/>
<HEAD>Of Mahomets lawes and eight Com∣mandements.</HEAD>
<P>AND for the better broaching abroad of his deuilish reli∣gions
hee hath prescribed certaine lawes or Commande∣ments,
and fortified the same by Policie.</P>
<P>His lawes are in number eight, which are partly Politicall
and party Ceremoniall.</P>
<P>The first, concerning God: which is this.</P>
<P>1. God is a great God, and one onely God, and Mahomet is
the Prophet of God.</P>
<P>In this Commandement they acknowledge a God; and also
Christ they acknowledge to be a great Prophet: but deny him
to be the Sonne of God, for God (say they) had no wife, and
therefore could haue no sonne. But <HI>Mahomet</HI> they hold to bee
a greater Prophet then Christ, and the last Prophet of all.</P>
<P>For it is a common saying amongst them, that <HI>Abraham</HI> was
the friend of God, <HI>Moses</HI> the messenger of God, Christ the
breath of God, and that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was the Prophet of God.
They speake reuerently of them all foure, and punish as well
those that blaspheme Christ, as those that speake euill of <HI>Ma∣homet.</HI>
Yea, they acknowledge Christ to be the Sonne of the
Virgine <HI>Mary,</HI> but not to haue beene borne according to the
common course of nature, but to haue procéeded from her
breasts. And as for his conception by the holy Ghost, they
know not what it meaneth; neither doe they know whether
there be any holy Ghost or not. But in their praiers they often
reiterate these words together, <HI>hu, hu, hu,</HI> that is: he, he, he. In
despite of all the Christians there is but one God; he, he, he, a∣lone
is God. For they hold, because we acknowledge thrée
persons, that therefore wee worship thrée Gods, and they ac∣knowledge
but one God, and are altogether ignorant of the
Trinitie in Ʋnitie, and Ʋnitie in Trinitie.</P>
<P>The second Commandement is, concerning their duety
toward their Parents, in these words.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="38"/>
2. Obey thy parents, and doe nothing to displease them, either
in word or deed.</P>
<P>How badly this duty is performed among them, I know by
experience: for I did neuer read or heare of more disobedient
children to their parents, either in word or déed.</P>
<P>The third is concerning their Neighbours, which is this:</P>
<P>3. Doe vnto others as thou wouldest be done vnto thy selfe.</P>
<P>Some of them are iust in their dealings one with another:
but most of them vniust &amp; deceitfull in their procéedings with
strangers, some few shopkéepers only excepted.</P>
<P>The fourth is concerning praier, wherein is required,</P>
<P>4. That euery man fiue times a day repaire to their Churches, to
make publike praier vnto Mahomet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkes</HI> haue no bels, but very faire Churches, and high
Steeples; and at the houres of their publike praier they are cal∣led
to Church by the voice of Criers, who goe vp into their stée∣ples,
and cry with a loud voice, <HI>Come now and worship the
great God.</HI> And sometimes also thus: <HI>La Illa Eillala, Mahomet
Resullala:</HI> that is, <HI>God is a great God, and Mahomet is his Pro∣phet.</HI>
And sometimes no more but thus: <HI>Ollah hethbar:</HI> that is,
<HI>God is alone:</HI> that is, <HI>There is but one God.</HI> And oftentimes
there is but one Crier in one stéeple. But on their Sabboth
day (which is friday) and at sundry other times, there are ma∣ny
men crying and bauling in euery stéeple, like a kennell of
hounds when they haue started their game.</P>
<P>The first méeting at publike praier euery day, is before the
rising of the sunne.</P>
<P>The second is about noone or midday, and on their Sabboth
day two houres sooner, and againe at noone, so that they pray
fiue times euery day, and on their Sabboth day, six times.</P>
<P>The third time for publike praier euery day, is at the tenth
houre of the day, called by the <HI>Turkes, Kindi;</HI> by the <HI>Moores, As∣sera,</HI>
about thrée or foure of the clocke after noone.</P>
<P>The fourth méeting is about sunne setting.</P>
<P>The fifth and last houre of praier, is two houres within
night, before they goe to sléepe.</P>
<P>Before they come to praier, they prepare themselues thereun∣to
<PB N="54" REF="39"/>
by outward washings of themselues, in token of reuerence,
and suffer no women to come to their Churches, lest the sight
of them should with-draw their mindes from praier. And
though they doe not come to Church, yet when they heare the
voice of the Criers, they will pray wheresoeuer they be, and fall
downe and kisse the ground thrée times.</P>
<P>Oftentimes also these Criers walke about the stéeples in the
euenings, and sing (after their rude manner) <HI>Dauids</HI> Psalmes
in the Arabicke tongue. And when rich men heare them sing
well, and with cléere voices, they are so delighted therewith,
that they vse to send them money.</P>
<P>Their fifth Commandement is concerning fasting, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>5. That one Moone in the yeere, euery one (of any reasonable
age) spend the whole time in fasting.</P>
<P>They haue but one Lent in the yéere, and then they fast ge∣nerally
in this manner: When the new moone changeth, which
they call <HI>Romadan,</HI> then during all that moone, they fast all the
day long betwixt sunne rising and sunne setting, and neither
eat nor drinke any thing at all. But when the sunne setteth,
then the crier calleth them to Church, and after they haue prai∣ed,
then they may eat what kinde of meat they will (sauing
swines flesh, which is forbidden by their Law) and as oft as
they will, vntill sunne rising: so that their Lent is but a chan∣ging
of day into night. During this moone <HI>Romadan,</HI> they ob∣serue
this kinde of abstinence very strictly. And so soone as the
next moone changeth, which they call <HI>Byram,</HI> then their Lent en∣deth,
and they hold a feast for thrée daies space together. At
which time (they say) <HI>Mahomet</HI> deliuered vnto them their law.</P>
<P>Their sixth Commandement is concerning Almesdéeds.</P>
<P>6. Let euery man, out of his store, giue vnto the poore, libe∣rally,
freely, and voluntarily.</P>
<P>Their Almes is either publike or priuate.</P>
<P>Their publike Almes is a sacrifice or offering of some beast
for a sacrifice vnto <HI>Mahomet</HI> once euery yéere: which being kil∣led,
it is cut into small péeces, and giuen all to the poore.</P>
<P>Their priuate Almes (notwithstanding their Law) is much
neglected; for I haue heard of many poore people who haue died
<PB N="55" REF="39"/>
amongst them for want of reléefe: and in the way as I haue
trauelled, I haue found some dead for hunger and cold. And
though a man be neuer so poore, yet if he be not able to pay his
Head money to the King yéerely, they are beaten, and their wo∣men
and children sold to pay it. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our murmuring and impa∣tient
poore were héere but a short time, they would learne to bee
more thankfull to God and man, and how to estéeme of a bene∣fit
bestowed on them, and not curse and reuile (as many of
them doe) if any one that passeth by them doe not giue vnto
them. The <HI>Turkes</HI> are more mercifull to birds, cats, and dogs,
than to the poore.</P>
<P>Their seuenth Commandement is concerning Marriage.</P>
<P>7. That euery man must of necessitie marry, to encrease and
multiply the Sect and Religion of Mahomet.</P>
<P>Their custome is to buy their wiues of their parents, and
neuer to sée them vntil they come to be married: and their mar∣riage
is nothing but enrolling in the <HI>Cadies</HI> booke. And it is
lawfull for them to take as many wiues as they will, or as ma∣ny
as they are able to kéepe. And whensoeuer he disliketh any
one of them, it is their vse to sell them or giue them to any of
their men-slaues. And although they loue their women neuer so
well, yet they neuer sit at table with men, no not with their
husbands, but wait at table and serue him, and when he hath
dined, they dine in secret by themselues, admitting no man or
mankinde amongst them, if he be aboue twelue yéeres of age.
And they neuer goe abroad without leaue of their husbands,
which is very seldome, except it be either to the <HI>Bannio</HI> or hot
Bath, or once a wéeke to wéepe at the graues of the dead, which
is vsually on Thursday, being the Ene before their Sabboth,
which is Friday, and the <HI>Iewes</HI> Sabboth on Saturday, and the
Christians on Sunday, thrée Sabboth daies together in one
Country. If their husbands haue béene abroad, at his en∣trance
into the house, if any one of their women be sitting on a
stoole, she riseth vp, and boweth herselfe to her husband, and
kisseth his hand, and setteth the same stoole for him, whereon
they sate, and stand so long as he is in presence.</P>
<P>If the like order were in England, women would be more
<PB N="56" REF="40"/>
dutifull and faithfull to their husbands than many of them are:
and especially, if there were the like punishment for whores,
there would be lesse whoredome: for there, if a man haue an
hundred women, if any one of them prostitute herselfe to any
man but her owne husband, he hath authoritie to binde her,
hands and feet, and cast her into the riuer with a stone about
her necke, and drowne her. And this is a common punishment
amongst them; but it is vsually done in the night. And the
man, if he be taken, is dismembred.</P>
<P>But the daughters and sisters of the great <HI>Turke</HI> are more
frée than all other men and women. For when their brethren
die, they liue: and when they come to yéeres of marriage, their
father (if he be liuing) or brother (if he be King) will giue vnto
them, for their husbands, the greatest <HI>Bashawes</HI> or <HI>Viziers</HI>
whom they shall affect, and say vnto them, Daughter, or sister,
I giue thée this man to be thy slaue and bedfellow: and if he be
not louing, dutifull, and obedient vnto thée, héere, I giue thée
a <HI>Canzhare</HI> (that is, a dagger) to cut off his head. And alwaies
after, those daughters or sisters of the King weare a broad and
sharpe dagger: and whensoeuer their husbands (which are gi∣uen
vnto them by the King to be their slaues) displease them,
they may and doe cut off their heads.</P>
<P>They exempt no calling from marriage, but hold it a blessing
from God to haue many children: and the desire of many chil∣dren
maketh them take many wiues. The <HI>Great Turke</HI> hath
many hundred, yea (as I haue heard) a thousand women only
for his owne vse. And yet, as <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> spake of <HI>Herod,</HI>
when he killed his owne two sonnes <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Aristobulus,</HI>
with the infants of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> rather than he would faile of his
purpose in killing Christ, <HI>It is better to bee Herods hogge than
his sonne; for his hogges liued, but his sonnes died:</HI> So it is bet∣ter
to be the <HI>Great Turkes</HI> hogge than his sonne: for they (be∣ing
forbidden by their Law to eat swines flesh, kill no hogges,
but all the sonnes of the <HI>Great Turke</HI> are strangled to death by
their eldest brother (after the death of their father) to auoid
treason.</P>
<P>A diuelish policie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hatto.</NOTE> and like vnto that of <HI>Hatto</HI> a Bishop of
<PB N="57" REF="40"/>
<HI>Mentz</HI> or <HI>Magunce</HI> in <HI>Germanie,</HI> who (as the Cronicles menti∣on)
500. yéeres agoe, in time of a great dearth, called all the
poore people in all the whole Country, into a great barne, pre∣tending
to make a great dole: But hauing them sure enough,
he fired the barne, and burnt them all vp, saying, <HI>These be the
Rats and Mice which deuoure vp the corne.</HI> This was his poli∣cie
to make bread better cheape. But for this vnmercifull mer∣cie,
God made him an example for all vnmercifull men, to the
worlds end. For a multitude of Rats came and deuoured him,
in such terrible sort, that where his name was written in win∣dowes,
walles, or hangings, they neuer ceased till it were ra∣zed
out; and droue him from house to house to saue his life. And
where he had a strong Tower in the middest of the great Riuer
of <HI>Rhene,</HI> which yet standeth there to be séene in the midst of the
Riuer, he thought himselfe sure if he could flie thither: Not∣withstanding,
the Rats swamme after him thither, and there
deuoured him: And it is called the Rats tower to this day, as
Trauellers know, and I my selfe haue séene this present yeere
1608. <HI>Iuly</HI> 7. It standeth on a little <HI>Jland</HI> in the midst of the
Riuer of <HI>Ryne,</HI> betwixt the Cities <HI>Mentz</HI> and <HI>Cullyn,</HI> or <HI>Colo∣nia,</HI>
néere vnto a Towne called <HI>Bingam</HI> on the one side of the
Riuer, and another Towne called <HI>Baccara,</HI> on the other side
the Riuer, where is made the best <HI>Rhenish</HI> wine in all <HI>Alma∣nia.</HI>
Not far from <HI>Sanquer,</HI> where there is a choller of iron faste∣ned
to a wall, whereinto all fresh Trauellers are enforced, by
their company, to put in their necks, to make them frée, and are
enhansed at <HI>Bobar</HI> vsually, or at <HI>Sanquer,</HI> if they lodge there.</P>
<P><HI>SVLTAN Mahomet</HI> (this great Turkes father) when he
came to the Crowne, put to death 19. of his brethren (according
to the custome of his predecessors) as a wicked policie to pre∣uent
treason.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> are yet somewhat better, (although too bad)
where the eldest sonne is king after the death of his father, and
all the rest of their brethren haue their eyes put out, yet liue.</P>
<P>Other Turkes haue thrée wiues, and haue as many women∣slaues
as they can kéepe, whom they vse as wiues, and esteeme
them equall with their wiues.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="41"/>
The manner of their mariage is this. First, if a man like
a yong woman, he buyeth her of her father, and giueth a great summne of money for her, and then enrolleth her in the <HI>Cadies</HI>
booke, that hee hath bought her of her Father for his wife, and
then the friends feast and banket together, and this is all they
performe in mariage. Onely the father of the yong woman gi∣ueth
great store of houshold-stuffe with her, and this is caried
openly by particulars through the stréetes of the citie on horses
or Cammels, and sometime by men and women, the parties
newly maried going before with musicke playing before them.</P>
<P>Their eight Commandement is the same with our sixt.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Thou shalt not kill.</HI></P>
<P>In their <HI>Alcoran</HI> it is written that God hateth murther. And
they say, that it is the second sinne which crept into the world
after the creation, being first committed by cursed <HI>Cain,</HI> who
killed his brother <HI>Abel.</HI> And their beliefe is, that this sinne of
wilfull murther is impardonable. But if it be by méere chance,
or in their owne defence, or else in lawfull wars, or in cases of
iustice by the Maiestrate they hold it lawfull.</P>
<P>Often haue I heard Turkes brawle one with another, and
in words most vilely reuile one another; but neuer did I sée
or heare of two Turkes in their priuate quarrels strike one
another, neither dare they strike one another, for if they do, they
are presently brought before the Maiestrate, and seuerely puni∣shed.
Yea, if one doe but lift vp his hand to strike another, hée
is cast into prison, and kept in irons, vntill he haue payed some
great fine, or receiued some other punishment. But they will
strike Iewes and Christians oftentimes, who dare not strike
them againe. If a man in secret be killed and found dead, ei∣ther
openly in the stréete, or priuately in an house, the master of
the house, or the parish where hee dwelleth must find out the
murtherer, otherwise hee himselfe shall be accused of murther,
and both he, and the whole <HI>Contrado</HI> where hee dwelleth must
pay vnto the <HI>Subbashaw</HI> so many hundred Dollers as shall be
required at their hands.</P>
<P>And therefore the <HI>Subbashaws</HI> oftentimes being wicked men,
doe hire some desperate person to kill a man in the night, that
<PB N="59" REF="41"/>
thereby he may take occasion to eat of the whole <HI>Contrado.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">William Matrin. Anno Dom. 1603. Sept. 18.</NOTE> We
had an English man, not long since, who sléeping on the <HI>Tarras,</HI>
(that is, on the top of the house) in the night, (as the custome
of the contrie is in the heate of Sommer) who had his throat
cut being asléepe in bed, by two or thrée wicked men, who came
from the stréete by a ladder to the top of the house; and after they
had committed this murther, being discried by the barking of a
dog, and séene also by the master of the house through his
chamber windowwhere he slept, (but not plainely discerned be∣ing
somewhat darke) they made haste downe againe, and were
neuer knowen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">leames Sa∣pers.</NOTE> But on the morrow after, the master of the
house (an English man also) was in trouble himselfe, because he
could not find out the murtherers, and it cost him an hundreth
Dollers at the least before hee could bee fréed, and the whole
<HI>Contrado</HI> or Parish, was also fined.</P>
<P>In like sort, if an house be robbed, he who is robbed, must
either finde out the thiefe, or els he himselfe shall be troubled for
it, and put to a great fine.</P>
<P>If an house be but endangered by fire either by the burning
of a chimney, or any other small part thereof without great
harme, yet they will lay to his charge, who dwelleth therein,
that he would haue burnt the whole Citie; and take from him
all that he hath, and imprison him as long as they please. Such
secret murtherers, théeues, and violent oppressors are they;
though their lawes forbid murther and theft, and they them∣selues
know those to bée guiltlesse whom they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Turks call that eating, which we call oppression or extortion.</NOTE> eate vpon, and
imprison.</P>
<P>Yea, <HI>Mahomet</HI> himselfe alloweth to his contrimen the <HI>Ara∣bians,</HI>
that is, to poore men, accustomed to liue vpon the spoile,
he alloweth theft, and setteth a law of reuengement. <HI>Hurt him</HI>
(saith he) <HI>which hurts you.</HI> He saith also, <HI>Hee that either killeth
his enemie or is killed by his enemie, entreth into Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>And it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vnusuall thing amongst them, specially for <HI>lene∣saries,</HI>
to kill their seruants as Butchers kill Calues, and throw
them into a ditch when they haue done: and oftentimes for
small offences lay them down on their ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vp their heeles, and bind their feete together and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="60" REF="42"/>
a coul staffe, and with a great cudgell giue them two or thrée
hundred blowes on the soles of their féete: after which punish∣ment
they are not able to stand on their feete for the space of ma∣nie
daies, and some of them goe lame alwaies after.</P>
<P>Seruants there are as vsually bought and sold in the market
with them, as bruite beasts amongst vs, whom they vse as
slaues in all kind of drudgerie. It it better to be a seruant in
England, then a master ouer many seruants in Turkey.</P>
<P>These are the eight Commandements of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>But the two chiefest points forbidden in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> are, the
eating of swines flesh, and the drinking of wine. Yet many
of them drinke wine vntill they be drunken: but I neuer heard
of any Turkes would eate swines flesh.</P>
<P>The things considered, being so fond and rediculous, it
may séeme strange, that men of courage in Turkey, doe not for∣sake
this deceiuer and deluder of mankind.</P>
<P>But it is the lesse strange if we consider how he hath fortified
his law with foure bulwarks or strong defences.</P>
<P>1. First, hée commandeth to kill them which speake against
the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> And therefore no man dare gainesay or deny any
thing contained in their <HI>Alcoran:</HI> but whosoeuer shall dare
either to dispute against that booke, or to doubt of any Article
therein written, he shall be sure, either to haue his tongue pul∣led
out of his head, or els his bodie to be burnt and consumed
with fire.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, he forbiddeth conference to be had with men of
a contrary sect or religion.</P>
<P>3. Thirdly, he forbiddeth credit to be giuen to any beside the
<HI>Alcoran.</HI></P>
<P>4. Fourthly, hee commandeth them to separate themselues
altogether from other men, and to say, <HI>Let me haue my law, and
take you yours: ye are free from, that which I doe, and I likewise
from that which you doe.</HI> And herein I hold it better for Mer∣chants
and other Christians to soiourne and to vse trade and
trafficke amongst Turkes then Papists; for, the Turke giueth
libertie of conscience to all men, and liketh well of euery man
that is forward and zealous in his owne religion.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="42"/>
But among the Papists no man can buy and sell, Vnlesse
hée beare the markes of the beast as S. <HI>John</HI> foretold, <HI>Reue∣lation</HI>
13. 17.</P>
<P>Moreouer, to driue away all feare of damnation from the
mindes of his Disciples, <HI>Mahomet</HI> telleth them, that euery man
shall be saued by his owne Religion (he only excepted which re∣uolteth
from the <HI>Alchoran</HI> vnto another Law) The <HI>lewes</HI> by the
Law of <HI>Moses; Christians</HI> by the Law of the Gospell; and the
<HI>Saracens</HI> by the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And they hold, that at the
day of iudgement all shall appeare vnder thrée banners; The
<HI>Iewes</HI> vnder the banner of <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> vnder the ban∣ner
of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Turkes</HI> and other <HI>Mahometans</HI> vnder <HI>Maho∣mets</HI>
banner, and vnder their conduct enter into Paradise,
which they describe after an earthly, sensuall, and brutish man∣ner;
affirming,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahomets paradise.</NOTE> <HI>That the ground of Paradise is of golD, which is
distinguished with pretious stones, and sweet flowers set thicke
together, planted with all fruitfull trees, the pleasant riuers run∣ning
thorow the greene fields, whereof some powre out milke,
others white honey, others the purest wine; and that there they
shall be clothed with all sorts of colours, except blacke.</HI> And
therefore the <HI>Turkes</HI> to this day weare no blacke; but when
they sée a man clothed in blacke, many of them will goe backe,
and say they will fly from him who shall neuer enter into Para∣dise.
Yet whosoeuer will liue in quiet amongst them, must<NOTE PLACE="marg">A note for trauellers.</NOTE>
neither meddle with their Law, their Women, nor their
slaues.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomets</HI> comming to iudgement was expected 20. yéeres
since; for their beléefe was, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> would come againe
at the end of 1000. yéeres (as he promised them) and bring them
to Paradise: which time expiring, and he not comming, they
haue dealt more fauourably with him, and giuen him longer
time; for they say he was extremely sicke when he was asked
of the time of his comming, and that he answered them with
such a low voice, that he could not well be vnderstood: and that
they which reported that he would returne at the end of 1000.
yéeres, mistooke him, for that he meant 2000. yéeres. At which
time, if he doe not come (according to promise) they will looke
<PB N="62" REF="43"/>
for him no longer, nor belacute;eue in him any more, but become
Christians.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moores</HI> are more ancient dwellers in <HI>Aleppo</HI> than <HI>Turks,</HI>
and more forward and zealous in <HI>Mahometisme</HI> than <HI>Turkes:</HI>
yea all the Churchmen amongst the <HI>Turkes</HI> are <HI>Moores,</HI> whom
the <HI>Turkes</HI> count a base people (in regard of themselues) and call
them <HI>Tots.</HI> Yet their Churchmen they haue in great reuerence;
and not only theirs, but they reuerence Churchmen of all nati∣ons,
and call them holy men, Saints, and men of God.</P>
<P>I my selfe haue had great experience héereof both in the place
of my abode at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and in my iourney towards <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
and in other places. In <HI>Aleppo</HI> as I haue walked in the stréets,
both <HI>Turkes,</HI> and <HI>Moores,</HI> and other Nations, would very reue∣rently
salute me after the manner of their Country: yea their
very souldiers, as I haue walked in the fields, with many other
of our Nation, without a <HI>Ienesarie</HI> to guard vs, though they
haue béene many hundreds together, yet haue they not offered
either me or any of my company wrong, for my sake, but haue
said one to another, <HI>Hadah Cassies;</HI> that is, <HI>This is a Church∣man,
and therefore take heed what you doe vnto him, for hee is a
good man, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Ierusalem</HI> many strangers of sundry Nations vnderstan∣ding
that I was an English Preacher, came and kissed my
hand, and called me the English Patriarke. Yea in all my ten
yéeres trauels, I neuer receiued, neither was offered wrong by
any Nation but mine owne Countrimen, and by them chiefly
whom it chiefly concerned to protect me from wrongs: yet haue
I found them most forward to offer me wrong only for doing
my duty, and following the order of our Church of England:
knowing that I had none of the Reuerend Fathers of our
Church to defend me. So would it be in England, if we had
not the Reuerend Fathers in God the Lord Bishops of our
Church to protect vs. All other Nations, both Heathen and
Christian, goe before vs héerein, in reuerencing and prouiding
for their Churchmen. The <HI>Turkes</HI> honour their <HI>Muftie</HI> (which
is their chiefe Ruler in Ecclesiasticall matters, next vnder the
<HI>Grand Signior</HI>) as an Angell: The <HI>Nostranes, Greekes, Ar∣menians,
<PB N="63" REF="43"/>
Chelfalines,</HI> and Christians of all other Nations, per∣forme
double honour vnto them: only in England, where there
is a more learned Ministery (I speake by experience) than in a∣ny
Nation in the world, they are least of all regarded: Which
maketh our Aduersaries, the Papists, say, (as I haue heard
some of them speake in my hearing, many thousand miles from
England) that if we our selues were perswaded of the truth of
our Religion, we would reuerence our Churchmen as they do,
and not scorne them and contemne them as we doe.</P>
<P>They also account fooles, dumbe men, and mad men, <HI>San∣tones,</HI>
that is, <HI>Saints.</HI> And whatsoeuer such mad men say or do,
though they take any thing out of their house, or stricke them,
and wound them, yet they take it in good part, and say, that
they shall haue good lucke after it. And when such madde men
die, they Canonize them for Saints, and erect stately Monu∣ments
ouer their graues, as we haue héere many examples, e∣specially
of one who (being mad) went alwaies naked, whose
name was <HI>Sheh Boubac,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheh Boubac.</NOTE> at whose death they bestowed great
cost on his funerall, and erected an house ouer his graue, where
(to this day) there are Lampes burning night and day, and ma∣ny
idle fellowes (whom they call <HI>Daruises</HI>) there maintained
to looke vnto his sepulcher, and to receiue the offerings of such
as come to offer to <HI>Sheh Boubac,</HI> which they take to themselues,
and there is no wéeke but many come out of the City of <HI>Aleppo</HI>
and other places, to offer. For this sepulcher is built on an hill,
thrée miles from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> betwéene the Kings garden and the
fountaine of fishes. If any be sicke, or in danger, they vow
that if they recouer or escape, they will offer so much money, or
this or that good thing to <HI>Sneh Boubac.</HI></P>
<P>There is also such another Bedlam Saint in <HI>Aleppo</HI> yet li∣uing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheh Maham∣met <HI>a</HI> naked Santone.</NOTE>
whom they call <HI>Sheh Mahammet a Santone,</HI> who goeth
alwaies naked, with a spit on his shoulders; and as hee goeth
thorow the stréets, the shop-kéepers will offer him their rings;
and if he thrust his spit thorow their rings, they take it for a fa∣uour,
and signe of good successe: The like account they make if
he take any thing from their shop boards, or bor them or any
of their house: yea they are yet more mad vpon this mad man
<PB N="64" REF="44"/>
than so, for both men and women will come vnto him, and kisse
his hand, or any other part, sometimes his thighs, and aske
him counsell, for they hold that mad mens soules are in heauen
talking with God, and that he reuealeth secrets vnto them. In
regard whereof, the <HI>Bashawes</HI> themselues oftentimes, and
chiefe Captaines will come vnto him with some present, and
kisse some part of his naked body, and aske him whether they
shall goe to battle or not, and what successe they shall haue in
warre: And looke whatsoeuer he saith, they hold it for an
Oracle.</P>
<P>Not long since, the <HI>Turkes</HI> had a victorie against the Chri∣stians;
and at their returne, they reported that this naked <HI>San∣tone
Sheh Mahammet</HI> of <HI>Aleppo</HI> was séene naked in the field
fighting against their enemies, and that by his helpe they ouer∣came
them, although he were not néere them by many thousand
miles. Whereby you may sée how the Deuil doth delude them
still, as he did their forefathers at the first by <HI>Mahomets Machi∣aucilian</HI>
deuices.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Daruises</HI> also they haue in such reputation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daruises.</NOTE> that often
times great <HI>Bashawes,</HI> when they are in dissáuour with the
King, and feare either losse of life, or goods, or both, to auoid
danger, will turne <HI>Daruises,</HI> and then they account themselues
priuileged persons from the rigour of their Law.</P>
<P>The witnesse of a <HI>Daruise</HI> or of a Churchman, will passe bet∣ter
than any mans witnesse besids, yea better than <HI>Shereffes</HI>
whom they account of <HI>Mahomets</HI> kindred, and they are know∣en
from others by their greene Shashes, which no man else
may weare: for greene, they account <HI>Mahomets</HI> colour, and if
they seeany Christian wearing a garment of that colour, they
will cut it from his backe, and beate him, and aske him how he
dare presume to weare <HI>Mahomets</HI> colour, and whether he bee
kine to God or not?. This I haue knowen put in practise vpon
Christians (not acquainted with the customes of the countrey)
since my comming: one for hauing but greene shooestrings,
had his shooes taken away. Another wearing greene breeches
vnder his Gowne (being espied) had his breeches cut off, and
he reuiled and beaten.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="44"/>
Wee of more knowledge come far behind them in reueren∣cing
the Preachers of the truth, and providing for them; and
it is to be feared that they shall rise vp at the day of iudgement
and condemne vs heerein.</P>
<P>The Turks haue no Printing amongst them, but all their
Law and their Religion is written in the <HI>Morisco</HI> tongue, that
is the <HI>Arabicke</HI> tongue. And hee is accounted a learned man a∣mongst
them, that can write and read. And as for the Latin
tonge, he is a rare man amongst them that can speake it. Some
few amongst them haue the Italian tong: and many (especally
in and about <HI>Constantinople</HI>) speake the vulgar Greeke, that
is <HI>Romeica</HI> tongue. For in <HI>Constantinople</HI> there are as many
<HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Hebrues,</HI> as <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The poore, amongst the <HI>Moores</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> beg of∣tentimes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Syntana Fissa.</NOTE>
in the streets in the name and for the sake of <HI>Syntana
Fissa,</HI> who was (as they say) a whore of charity, and would
prostitue her selfe to any man <HI>Bacshese</HI> (as they say in the <HI>Ara∣bicke</HI>
tongue) that is <HI>gratis</HI> freely.</P>
<P>The Diet of the Turks is not very sumptuous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diet of the Turkes. Pilawe.</NOTE> for the most
common dish is Pilaw, which is good sauory meat made of Rise,
and small morsels of Mutton boyled therein, and sometimes
rosted Buckones, (that is, small bits or morsels of flesh.) Their
more costly fare is Sambouses and Muclebites. Sambouses
are made of paste like a great round Pastie with varietie of
hearbes and meates therein, not minced but in Buckones. A
Muclebite is a dish made of Egs and hearbs. Their smaller
Sambouses are more common, not so big as a mans hand, like
a square Pastie, with minsed meat therein. They haue also va∣rietie
of Helloway, that is, swéet meats compounded in such sort
as are not to be séen elswhere. The poorer sort féed on hearbs and
fruites of the trées.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coffa.</NOTE> Their most common drinke is <HI>Coffa,</HI> which
is a blacke kind of drinke made of a kind of Pulse like Pease,
called <HI>Coaua;</HI> which being grownd in the mill, and boiled in
water, they drinke it as hot as they can suffer it; which they
find to agrée very well with them against their crudities and
féeding on hearbs and rawemeates.</P>
<P>Other compound drinkes they haue called <HI>Sherbet,</HI> made of
<PB N="66" REF="45"/>
water and Sugar, or hony, with snow therein to make it coole;
for although the countrie bee hote, yet they kéepe snow all the
yeere long to coole their drinke.</P>
<P>It is accounted a great curtesie amongst them to giue vnto
their frends when they come to visit them, a Fin-ion or Scudel∣la
of <HI>Coffa,</HI> which is more holesome than toothsome, for it cau∣seth
good concoction, and driueth away drowsinesse. Some
of them will also drinke Bersh or Opium, which maketh them
forget themselues, and talke idly of Castles in the ayre, as
though they saw visions, and heard Reuelations.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Coffa</HI> houses are more common than Ale-houses in
England; but they vse not so much to sit in the houses as on
benches on both sides the stréets néere vnto a <HI>Coffa</HI> house, euery
man with his Fin-ion ful; which being smoking hot, they vse to
put it to their noses &amp; eares, and then sup it off by leasure, being
full of idle and Ale-house talke whiles they are amongst them∣selues
drinking of it; if there be any news, it is talked of there.
They haue also excellent good fountaine waters in most places
of that countrie, which is a common drinke amongst them, espe∣cially
in Sommer time, and in their trauels at all times of the
yéere.</P>
<P>Some of our Merchants haue weighed their water and ours
in England when they haue come home, and haue found their
water lighter then ours by foure ounces in the pound; and the
lighter the water is, the more pleasant it is to drinke, and goeth
downe more delectably, as if it were milke rather than water.</P>
<P>In great Cities where the fountaines are either farre off, or
not so plentifull, there are certaine poore men which goe about
the stréetes from morning to night with a Beares skinne full of
water, sowed vp and fastened about his stoulders like a Tin∣kers
budget, with a bole of brasse in his hand, and offreth water
freely to them that passe by, except they giue them any thing in
curtesie, (some seldom times.)</P>
<P>The greatest part of them are very courteous people amongst<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salutations of the Turks.</NOTE>
themselues, saluting one another at their méetingwith their
hand on their brest (for they neuer vncouer their head) with
these words: <HI>Salam Alike Sultanum:</HI> that is, peace be vnto you
<PB N="67" REF="45"/>
Sir. Whereunto the other replieth, <HI>Alekem Salam,</HI> that is:
Peace be to you also. And sometime thus: <HI>Elph Marhabba ia∣num.</HI>
Or in <HI>Turkish</HI> thus: <HI>Hosh Geldanos, Sophi Geldanos:</HI>
that is: Welcome my déere friend. And in the morning, <HI>Sub∣alkier
Sultanum,</HI> that is, good morrow Sir: and in the euening
thus. <HI>Misalker Sultanum,</HI> that is: good euen Sir.</P>
<P>And when friends and acquaintance meet, who haue not séene
one another many dayes before, they salute one another in
<HI>Turkish,</HI> thus: <HI>Neder halen?</HI> that is: how doe you? In <HI>Arabick</HI>
thus, <HI>Ish halac Seedi?</HI> that is: How doe you Sir? And <HI>Ish bab∣tac?</HI>
that is: how doth thy Gate? (meaning all within his gate)
And so procéed by particulers to aske how doth thy Child, slaue,
horse, cat, dog, asse, &amp;c. and euery thing in the house, except his
wife; for that is held a very vnkind question, and not vsuall a∣mongst
them. And if a man come to their houses, and at the
doore enquire of the children for their father, they will answere
him: but if he enquire for the mother, they will throw stones
at him and reuile him.</P>
<P>Their women (as hath béene shewed before) haue little liber∣ty
to come abroad, except it be on the Eue before their Sabbath,
(which is Thursday) to wéepe at the graues of the dead, or to the
<HI>Bannios</HI> or hot Bathes to wash themselues (as the vse of the
contry is.) And when they come abroad, they are alwayes mas∣ked;
for it is accounted a shame for a woman to be séene bare-fa∣ced:
yea, they are so iealous and suspitious ouer them, that fa∣thers
wil not suffer their owne sonnes, after they come to foure∣téene
yéeres of age, to sée their mothers.</P>
<P>These be their common salutations one to another.</P>
<P>Their more speciall salutations to great personages are
these.</P>
<P>When a man commeth to salute the great <HI>Turke,</HI> or Grand
Signior himselfe (into whose presence few are admitted except
Ambassadors and great Personages) they are led betwéene
two by the armes, for feare of a stab, by which meanes one of
their Grand Signiors was once killed, and when they returne,
they goe backwards; for it is accounted a disgrace to turne their
back-parts to a great man. In like manner they salute their
<PB N="68" REF="46"/>
<HI>Bashawes</HI> and other great men, (but not led by the armes) but
with their hands on the brest, bowing downe their heads to
kisse the skirt of his garment, pronouncing these words, <HI>Ollah
towal omrac Seedi.</HI> That is: God prolong your dayes Sir. And
so long as they talke with a <HI>Bashaw</HI> they stand with their hands
on their brest maiden-like, and bow low at their departure,
and goe backward. They neuer vncouer their heads vnto any
man, no not to the King himselfe; yea, it is a word of reproach
amongst them to say when they mislike a matter, <HI>I had as liue
thou shewedst me thy bare head.</HI></P>
<P>They call one another diuersly, and not alwaies by their
names, but sometimes by their fathers Calling, trade, or de∣grée:
as <HI>Eben Sultan,</HI> that is, <HI>The sonne of a King: Eben Terzi,
The sonne of a Tailor.</HI></P>
<P>And sometimes by their father qualities, as <HI>Eben Sacran,</HI>
that is, <HI>The sonne of a Drunkard.</HI></P>
<P>And sometimes by their markes, as <HI>Colac cis,</HI> that is, <HI>A
man without eares: Cowsi Sepher,</HI> that is <HI>Sepher with the thinne
beard.</HI></P>
<P>And sometimes by their Stature, as <HI>Tow-ill,</HI> that is, <HI>A tall
man: Sgire rugiall,</HI> that is, <HI>A little man.</HI></P>
<P>And sometimes by their Offices, as <HI>I-asgee,</HI> that is, <HI>A Secre∣tarie:
Nibe,</HI> that is, <HI>A Clerke, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And sometimes by their humours, as</HI> Chiplac, <HI>that is,</HI> A
naked man; Or, <HI>One who was of a humour to weare no cloathes
but breeches.</HI></P>
<P>But their common word of curtesie either to strangers, or
such whose names they know not, or whom they purpose to re∣uerence,
is <HI>Chillabee,</HI> that is, <HI>Gentleman.</HI> And there is no man
amongst them of any degrée, will refuse to answer to any of
these names. But if nature haue marked them either with
gogle eies, bunch backes, lame legs, or any other infirmitie or
deformitie, as they are knowen by it, so they are content to bée
called by it.</P>
<P>But they that haue gone on pilgrimage to their holy Citie
<HI>Mecha,</HI> where their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> was buried, at their
returne are called Hogies, that is, <HI>Pilgrimes,</HI> as <HI>Hogie Tahar,
<PB N="69" REF="46"/>
Hogie Mahammet, &amp;c.</HI> which is counted a word of great grace
and credit amongst them. And the witnesse of an <HI>Hogie</HI> will be
taken before any other.</P>

<P>TThere are also many <HI>Arabians</HI> in <HI>Aleppo,</HI> called vulgarly,
<HI>Arabs</HI> or <HI>Bedweens.</HI> They cal themselues <HI>Saracens,</HI> of <HI>Sara;</HI>
but they are rather <HI>Ishmalites,</HI> of <HI>Ishmael Abrahams</HI> sonne by
<HI>Hagar,</HI> and therefore also called <HI>Hagarens.</HI> But some take them
to be of the race of the <HI>Sabaeans,</HI> which were wilde and sauage
people, of <HI>Sabaea,</HI> a Country in the middle of <HI>Arabia,</HI> towards
the East, enuironed with great Rocks, where is great store of
<HI>Cynnomon</HI> and <HI>Casia, Frankincense</HI> and <HI>Myrrh,</HI> which people
came of <HI>Sheba,</HI> nephew to <HI>Ketura</HI> and <HI>Abraham.</HI> Their natiue
Country was <HI>Arabia,</HI> a Country in <HI>Asia,</HI> betwéene <HI>Iudaea</HI> and
<HI>Egypt,</HI> so called of <HI>Arabus</HI> the sonne of <HI>Apollo.</HI> It is diuided
into thrée Regions, which are these, <HI>Arabia Petrea, Arabia De∣serta,</HI>
and <HI>Arabia Foelix.</HI> But at this day they haue no certaine
Country or place of abode, but wander vp and downe thorow∣out
all <HI>Syria, Assyria, Gallely, Iudaea, Palestina,</HI> and <HI>Egypt.</HI> And
as in <HI>Iobs</HI> tune they liued by theft and robberie and spoile of
men, so doe they also to this present day. They haue two Kings
at this day, <HI>viz. Dandan</HI> and <HI>Aborisha;</HI> the one their lawfull
King, the other an Vsurper; and some follow the one, and some
the other, and are bitter enemies one to another; yet haue I sel∣dome
heard of any great wars betwixt them, for they seldome
méet. They neuer come into any walled Townes or Cities, for
feare of treason: but liue in tents, and are héere to day, and ma∣ny
hundred miles off within few daies after.</P>
<P>They are a base, beggerly, and rogish people; wandering vp
and downe, and liuing by spoile, which they account no sinne,
because they are <HI>Mahomets</HI> Countrimen, and he allowed them
liberty to liue by theft. Yet their Kings doe no great harme, but
take toule or tribute of the Carauans as they passe by, which if
they pay willingly, they passe quietly, and are not robbed, but
a little exacted vpon.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="47"/>
One of their Kings hath often times pitched his tents néere
vnto the City of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and many Merchants being desirous
to see them and their order, tooke occasion to present him with
some small present or other, which he tooke very kindly, and
admitted them to his table, and gaue them a tent to lodge in all
night: on the morrow for breakfast one of them made him a
minsed pie, and set it before him hot as it came out of the ouen:
But as <HI>Diogines</HI> accustomed to féed on roots, hauing a péece of a
tart giuen him to eat, and as he was eating it, being asked what
it was, answered that it was bread; and when he was laughed
at for his answer, he said again, Either it is bread of a very good
making, or bread very wel handled in the baking: So this Sy∣nicall
or Diogenicall King accustomed to féed grosly, hauing ne∣uer
séene a pie or pastie before, maruelled what it was: And
when he saw it cut vp and opened, and perceiued smoke to comè
out of it, shrunke backe, fearing it had béene some engine to de∣stroy
him, and that the fire would follow after the smoke. But
when he perceiued no fire followed the smoke, he was content
to taste of it, and highly commended it, as the daintiest dish that
euer he tasted of in his life.</P>
<P>These <HI>Arabian</HI> Kings neuer kéepe any money in their purses,
but spend it as fast as they finde it, and when they want, with
their sword they séeke a new purchase. Some are souldiers,
fighting faithfully on any side that will giue them pay. Some
of this rogish <HI>Arabian</HI> race follow neither of their Kings, but
wander from place to place in caues and rocks, and liue by their
sword, not only robbing, but killing such as they can ouercome.
Others of them (of a better minde) soiourne in Cities of trade
and trafficke, and make themselues seruants to any Nation
that will set them on worke, and well reward them. Some of
them are horse-kéepers, some Bastages, that is, Porters, and
some vnder-cookes in kitchins, and are very seruiceable. But
for the most part their lodgings are on some dunghill or other,
or odde corner of the City, with some silly tent ouer their heads.
Their wiues weare rings in their noses, either of siluer or
brasse, fastned to the middle gristle of their nose, and colour
their lips blew with <HI>Indico,</HI> and goe alwaies bare legged and
<PB N="71" REF="47"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or rings of brasse aboe their ancles and bracelets of brasse abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their hands. They are people which

and lodging. Their women are skilfull in mourning and cry∣ing
by art, and therefore they are hired to cry at the funerals of
<HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Moores</HI> oftentimes, tearing their haire, and ma∣king
all their face blew with <HI>Indico;</HI> The chiefest thing that I
haue obserued in them, worth praise, is this, that they retaine
the vse of speaking their naturall tongue to this day, speaking
the <HI>Arabicke</HI> naturally, which is a farre more learned language
than the <HI>Turkish:</HI> for as the <HI>Turkes</HI> Religion is a mixed Reli∣gion,
compounded of many Religions; so is their language al∣so
a medly language, or (as I may iustly call it) a linke wolfie
Religion and language, compounded of many other languages,
wherein nothing is written. But the <HI>Arabian</HI> tongue is a lear∣ned
language, wherein Aui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en and many learned Physitians
haue written much, and to this day the <HI>Turkes Alcoran</HI> and all
their Law and Religion is written in the <HI>Arabicke</HI> tongue,
which is one of those Orientall Languages which depend on
the Hebrue tongue, wherin because you haue some knowledge,
and are studious in the tongues, (according to your request in
your last letters) I will àcquaint you what languages are héere
spoken, and which languages are most common and commen∣dable
to trauellers to goe furthest withall. There are héere spo∣ken
so many seuerall languages as there are seuerall Nations
héere dwelling or soiourning, euery Nation (amongst them∣selues)
speaking their owne language. And héere are of most
Nations in the world some, who either come with their Mer∣chandise
to sell or by commodities, or soiourne héere as stran∣gers,
or else haue accesse, and recesse to this City as trauellers.
But of all Christian languages, the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue is most vsed,
and therewithall a man may trauell furthest. But of all the
Orientoll tongues, these foure are most spoken in these parts,
<HI>Arabicke, Turkish, Armenian,</HI> and <HI>Persian,</HI> or <HI>Agimesco:</HI> Of
euerie one of which languages (that you may sée how they dif∣fer)
I will shew you how they number from one to twenty,
to satisfie your expectation.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Jewes.</HEAD>
<P>BEsides all these <HI>Mahometans</HI> (which I haue already named)
there are many Iewes in <HI>Constantinople, Aleppo, Damas∣cus,
Babylon, Grand Cayro,</HI> and euery great Citie and place of
Marchandise throughout all the Turkes dominions, who are
knowne by their hatts: for they were accustomed to weare red
hatts without br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes at my first comming: But lately (the
head <HI>Vizier</HI> being their enemy) they are constrained to weare
hatts of blewe cloth, because red was accounted too stately
and princelike a colour for them to weare.</P>
<P>They are called by three names, which were giuen to them of
old. First, they are called <HI>Hebrewes,</HI> (as some suppose) of <HI>Heber</HI>
the fourth from <HI>Noah,</HI> in whom the hebrew tongue remained
at the confusion of tongues, whence he had his name. But S.
<HI>Augustine</HI> and other fathers affirme, that they were first called
<HI>Hebreweof Abraham,</HI> with the alteration of a fewe letters, <HI>He∣braei
quasi Abrahaei,</HI> that is, <HI>Hebrewes</HI> as it were <HI>Abrahites.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly they were called Israelites from <HI>Jacob</HI> surnamed <HI>Is∣rael,</HI>
whose grandfathers <HI>Abraham</HI> was.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they were called <HI>Iewes,</HI> after that <HI>Juda</HI> and <HI>Benia∣min</HI>
(which for the vnity of minds were (as it were one <HI>Tribe</HI>)
following <HI>Rehoboam</HI> the sonne of <HI>Solomon</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Iuda,</HI>
made the kingdome of Iuda. The other ten betaking them to
<HI>Ieroboam</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> set vp the kingdome of the
<HI>Ephramites</HI> or <HI>Israel.</HI> And what became of those ten tribes, the
Iewes acknowledge themselues to be ignorant. Only some of
their <HI>Rabbies</HI> thinke them to bee in <HI>Tarracia:</HI> the onely reason
which I haue heard them alledge for their opinion is this, be∣cause
they often vnderstand by <HI>Tartarians</HI> who came from
thence to vse marchandise in <HI>Aleppo</HI> and else where, that there
are many amongst them called by <HI>Hebrew</HI> names to this day.
Of these thrée names whereby they are knowne, the most com∣mon
name whereby they are called at this day is, the name of
<HI>Iewes.</HI> One and the same people thrice changed their names, &amp;
often the place of their abode: And to this day they haue no
<PB N="73" REF="49"/>
king nor country proper to themselues, but are dispersed through∣out
the whole world, and in euery place where they come, they
are contemptible and of base account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 27. 25.</NOTE> according to the cry of
those crucifiers. <HI>His blood bee vpon vs and our children,</HI> which
is fulfilled this day in our eares and eies. They are of more
vile account in the sight of <HI>Turkes</HI> then <HI>Christians;</HI> in so much
that if a Iewe would turne Turke, he must first turne <HI>Christi∣an</HI>
before they will admit him to be a <HI>Turke.</HI> Yea, it is a word
of reproach amongst the <HI>Turkes,</HI> &amp; a vsuall protestation amongst
them, when they are falsly accused of any crime, to cleare them∣selues
they vse to protest in this manner, <HI>If this be true; then
God graunt I may die a Iewe,</HI> And the Iewes in like cases vse
to say, <HI>If this be not a false accusation, then God graunt I may
dye a Christian,</HI> praying better for themselues then they be∣lieue,
and as all of them must be that shall bee saued. And the
poore <HI>Christians</HI> soiourning and dwelling in these partes doe
hate them very vncharitably and irreligiously: (in that we read
<HI>Rom.</HI> 11. many arguments prouing that they shall bee con∣uerted
againe.) for on good fryday in many places (especially
at <HI>Zante</HI>) they throw stones at them, insomuch that they dare
not come out of their houses all that day, and yet are scarse in
safety in their houses, for they vse to throw stones at their win∣dowes
and dores, and on the roofe of their houses. On thrus∣day
about noone, the Iewes begin to kéepe within dores, and
continue there with their dores shut vntil saturday about noone,
for if they come forth before that time they are sure to be sto∣ned,
but after noone on Easter eue if they come abroad, they
may passe as quietly as euer they did. These in their blinde
zeale thinke to be reuenged on them for whom Christ prayed
saying, <HI>Father forgiue them, for they know not what they
doe.</HI></P>
<P>And some ignorant Christians refuse to eat of their meat or
bread: their reason is, because the <HI>Iewes</HI> refuse to eat or drinke
with Christians to this day, or to eat any meat that Christians
kill. But it is not vnusuall amongst Christians of better know∣ledge,
to eat of the <HI>Jewes</HI> meat, which ordinarily they buy of
them: for the <HI>Iewes</HI> to this day eat not of the hinderpart of any
<PB N="74" REF="50"/>
beast, but only of the former parts, and sell the hinder quarters
of their béefe, mutton, kids, goats, &amp;c. to Christians.</P>
<P>They obserue still all their old Ceremonies and feasts, Sa∣crifices
only excepted, which the <HI>Turkes</HI> will not suffer them to
doe: for they were wont amongst them to sacrifice children,
but dare not now for feare of the <HI>Turkes.</HI> Yet some of them
haue confessed, that their Physitians kill some Christian pati∣ent
or other, whom they haue vnder their hands at that time,
in stead of a sacrifice.</P>
<P>If a man die without children, the next brother taketh his
wife, and raiseth vp séed vnto his brother: and they still marry
in their owne kindred. Many of them are rich Merchants:
some of them Drogomen, and some Brokers. Most of them
are very crafty and deceitfull people. They haue no beggers
amongst them, but many théeues, and some who steale for ne∣cessity,
because they dare not begge.</P>
<P>They are also very great Vsurers, and therein the <HI>Turkes</HI>
ecell them: for although there be Vsurers amongst them, yet
they allow it not: for if a Christian or any man borrow money
of a <HI>Turke</HI> (though he promise him interest) yet if he pay the
principall, he dares not molest him for interest, nor complaine
of him, being against their law.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iewes</HI> Sabboth is on Saturday, which they obserue so
strictly, that they will not trauell vpon any occasion on that
day, nor receiue money, nor handle a pen to write, (as I haue
knowen by experience in a Doctor of Physicke:) but on the
morrow he would take double fées of his Patient.</P>
<P>They read their law in the Hebrue tongue, written in Phy∣lacteries
or long roles of parchment. And the Old Testament
is also read in the Hebrue. But their Cakams and Cohens
preach in the Spanish tongue. All matters of controuersie be∣twixt
themselues are brought before their Cakam to decide,
who is their chiefe Churchman. <HI>Cakam</HI> in Hebrue is as much
as <HI>Sapiens</HI> in Latine, that is, a wise man: and <HI>Cohen</HI> in Hebrue
is as much as <HI>Sacerdos</HI> in Latine, that is, a Priest.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Iewes</HI> can read Hebrue, but few of them speake
it, except it be in two places in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and that is at <HI>Salonica,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="50"/>
formerly called <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> a City in <HI>Macedonia</HI> by the gulfe
<HI>Thermaicus;</HI> and at <HI>Safetta</HI> in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> néere vnto the sea
of <HI>Galile:</HI> Which two places are as it were Vwersities or
Schooles of learning amongst them, and there (<HI>honoris grati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>)
they speake Hebrue.</P>
<P>I haue sundry times had conference with many of them;
and some of them, yea the greatest part of them, are blasphe∣mous
wretches, who (when they are pressed with an argument
which they cannot answer) breake out into opprobrious spée∣ches,
and say Christ was a false Prophet, and that his Disci∣ples
stole him out of his graue whiles the souldiers (who wat∣ched
him) slept: and that their forefathers did deseruedly cruci∣fie
him; and that if he were now liuing, they would vse him
worse than euer then forefathers did.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Christians of sundry sorts so∣iourning
in Aleppo.</HEAD>
<P>Besides these <HI>Turkes, Moores,</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> (which are all
Mahometans) and <HI>Iewes</HI> (which are Talmudists) there are
also sundry sorts of Christians in this Countrey, which are of
two sorts, either such as were borne, brought vp, and dwelled
in the Country, or such as were borne in Christendome, and
only soiourne héere for a time to exercise merchandises.</P>
<P>The first sort who were borne in this Heathen Countrey,
and dwell there, are either <HI>Armenians, Maronites, Iacobites,
Georgians, Chelfalines,</HI> or <HI>Greekes;</HI> which are all gouerned by
their Patriarkes for Ecclesiasticall matters. But for ciuill go∣uernment,
both they and their Patriarkes are subiect to Tur∣kish
Lawes, yea they are all slaues vnto the great Turk, whom
they call their <HI>Grand Signior.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Nostranes or Nazaritans.</HEAD>
<P>Amongst all these sorts of Christians, there is amongst the
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ronites</HI> an ancient / company of Christians, called vulgarly
<PB N="76" REF="51"/>
Nostranes, <HI>quasi</HI> Nazaritans, of the Sect of the <HI>Nazarites,</HI> more
ciuill and harmlesse people than any of the rest. Their Country
is <HI>Mount Lybanus</HI> (as I wrote vnto you héeretofore) but many
of them dwell at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> whereof some of them are <HI>Cassises,</HI>
that is, Churchmen; some of them are Cookes, and seruants
vnto English Merchants and others; some Artificers: All of
them liue somewhat poorely, but they are more honest and true
in their conuersation than any of the rest, especially at their first
comming from <HI>Mount Lybanus</HI> to dwell in <HI>Aleppo;</HI> and many
during their continuance there, if they be not corrupted by o∣ther
wicked Nations there dwelling: in whom I obserued more
by experience than I heard of them, or noted in them when I
was amongst them at <HI>Mount Lybanus.</HI> And especially for the
manner of their marriage, and how they honour the same.</P>
<P>They buy their wiues of their fathers (as others there dwel∣ling,
doe) but neuer sée them vntill they come to be married, nor
then neither vntill the mariage be solemnized betwixt them: for
there is a partition in the place where they méet to be married,
and the man and his friends stand on the one side, and the yoong
woman &amp; her friends on the other side, where they may heare,
but not sée one another, vntill the <HI>Cassies</HI> bid the yoong man put
his hand thorow an hole in the wall, and take his wife by the
hand. And whiles they haue hand in hand, the mother of the
maid commeth with some sharpe instrument made for the pur∣pose,
and all to bepricketh the new married mans hand, and
maketh it bléed. And if he let her hand goe when he féeleth his
hand smart, they hold it for a signe that he will not loue her:
But if he hold fast (notwithstanding the smart) and wring her
hard by the hand vntill she cry, rather than he will once shrinke,
then he is counted a louing man, and her friends are glad that
they haue bestowed her on him.</P>
<P>And how they honour marriage aboue others, I obserued
by the naming of their first manchilde. For as amongst vs the
women, when they are married, lose their Surnames, and are
surnamed by the husbands surname, and children likewise; so
amongst them the father loseth his name, and is called by the
name of his eldest sonne, in this manner. I haue knowen a
<PB N="77" REF="51"/>
<HI>Nostrane</HI> whose name was <HI>Mou-se,</HI> that is, <HI>Moses,</HI> who ha∣uing
a manchilde, named him <HI>Vseph,</HI> that is, <HI>Ioseph,</HI> and then
was the father no more called <HI>Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> but <HI>Abou Vseph,</HI>
that is, the father of <HI>Ioseph.</HI> Another whose name was <HI>Vseph,</HI>
named his eldest sonne <HI>Pher-iolla,</HI> after which he was no more
called <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eph,</HI> but <HI>Abou Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r-iolla,</HI> the father of <HI>Pher-iolla.</HI> An∣other
man called <HI>Iubraell,</HI> that is, <HI>Gabriell,</HI> his sonne at the time
of Baptisme being named <HI>Mouse,</HI> he alwaies after was called
<HI>Abou Mouse,</HI> that is, the father of <HI>Moses:</HI> such an honour doe
they account it to be father of a manchilde.</P>
<P>These <HI>Nostranes</HI> reuerence their <HI>Cassises</HI> greatly, and kisse
their hand wheresoeuer they méet them: yet are most of them
altogether vnlearned, hauing only the knowledge of the Syri∣ac
tongue, wherein their Liturgie is read.</P>
<P>They kéepe their Feasts at the same time as we doe, <HI>viz.</HI>
Christmasse, Easter, and Whitsuntide: and at Christmasse on
the Twelfth day in the morning, called <HI>Epiphanie,</HI> their yoong
men haue a custome (betimes in the morning) to leape naked
into the water: I could neuer heare any reason of their so do∣ing,
but <HI>Vzansa de prease,</HI> the Custome of their Countrey. And
though it be then very cold, yet they perswade themselues and
others, that then it is hotter than at any other time, and that
the water then hath an extraordinarie vertue to wash away
their sinnes.</P>
<P>On Munday in Easter wéeke and Whitsun wéeke, these <HI>No∣stranes</HI>
goe with their <HI>Cassises</HI> to the graues of the dead, and
there knéele downe, and burne incense, and pray at euery
graue.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>Of the Chelfalines.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Chelfalines</HI> are Christians, dwelling vpon the borders
of <HI>Persia,</HI> betwéene <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> at a place cal∣led

be but one peece ouer, so soone as they perceiue it, though it bée
many daies after, they will bring it backe againe, and restore
it, and thinke they shall neuer returne safely into their Coun∣try,
if they should not make restitution thereof. These people
perswade themselues, and report vnto others, that they dwell
in that place which was called <HI>Eden,</HI> whereinto <HI>Adam</HI> was put
to keepe it and dresse it. But some hold that this pleasant gar∣den
<HI>Eden</HI> did extend ouer all the earth. But by the second chap∣ter
of <HI>Genesis</HI> it appeareth manifestly, that this garden where∣in
man was placed, which we call <HI>Paradise,</HI> was a certaine
place on earth, not spreading ouer all, but only a part thereof,
containing a conuenient portion of the Countrey called <HI>Eden,</HI>
bounding vpon the Riuer <HI>Euphrates▪</HI> which Riuer is deuided
into foure streames, and runneth (or at leastwise did then flow)
in manner as it is described, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 10. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Eden</HI> is the
name of a Country, so called for the pleasantnesse of it. For <HI>Ha∣dan</HI>
in Hebrue, is in English to delight. From hence also the
<HI>Greekes</HI> call pleasure, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>And howsoeuer it besomewhat probable, that these <HI>Chelpha∣lines</HI>
dwell now in that Country which was called <HI>Eden,</HI> yet
<HI>Plato,</HI> and <HI>Aristo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,</HI> and <HI>Lactantius,</HI> and others, doe constantly
affirme (as they haue receiued of ancient monuments) that
Mountaines, and Riuers, and Ilands, and Countries, haue
receiued much alteration in this kinde. <HI>Sicilia</HI> is said to haue
beene diuided from <HI>Italy, Cyprus</HI> from <HI>Syria, England</HI> from
<HI>France,</HI> by the violence of the Sea, whereas before they were
ioined, as <HI>Pelo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> is to the rest of <HI>Grecia,</HI> or as the towne
of <HI>Rye</HI> (at an high water) séemeth to be to the rest of England:
So that no certainty can be giuen either by reading, or trauel∣ling,
of the place where <HI>Eden</HI> was, because these Riuers run in
other streames: forasmuch as <HI>Cyrus,</HI> at the taking of <HI>Babylon,</HI>
is affirmed to haue restrained the maine chanell of this very ri∣uer
<HI>Euphrates,</HI> vnto an vnwonted course; and to haue deuided
the riuer <HI>Gindes</HI> (which is next vnto it in greatnesse) into 360.
streames. Besides, the Country of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> by which
these riuers passe, being partly dry and sandy, and seldome wa∣tered
with the showers of heauen; and on the other part, excée∣ding
<PB N="79" REF="52"/>
fruitfull by the nature of the soile; is (by the industry of
the inhabitants) so nourished with waters, by cutting out cha∣nels
and ditches out of the maine streames, as the same is a∣mended,
where it is barren, of the same vnfruitfulnesse; and
corrected againe of his ouerrich increase, where it is ouer fertile.
No maruell therefore if these riuers are not fully agreed vpon
by Writers, hauing lost perhaps their ancient streames, toge∣ther
with their names, as Paradise, and the whole earth be∣sides
hash lost her ancient fruitfulnesse.</P>
<P>And these <HI>Chelphalines</HI> are ignorant people, and haue no
reason to prooue that they now dwell in the place which was
called <HI>Eden,</HI> whereinto <HI>Adam</HI> was put to kéepe it and to dresse
it, but that the riuer <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and other riuers (mentioned
<HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 10. 11. 12.) run by their Country.</P>
<P>Others of them say, that they haue receiued it by Tradition
from their Elders, from time to time. But that which God
hath concealed, I will not search out. But (notwithstanding
all that I haue read, heard, or séene in my trauels) I resolue my
selfe, that no man liuing can demonstrate the place, which God
(for the sinnes of <HI>Adam</HI>) accursed; and euer since, the place is

<P>They hate the Papists, and yet in many things agrée with

<P>The <HI>Greeke</HI> in <HI>Aleppo</HI> are very poore, for they are there (for

<P>In <HI>Pera</HI> or <HI>Gallata</HI> (on the other fide the water) there is a

with his money, and left this light huswife to the mercie of her
former louers, hauing thrée husbands liuing, yet shee her selfe
liuing with none of them. This is common in euery mans
mouth thereabouts, and talked of many thousand miles off, to
the disgrace of his Countrie, and slander of Christianitie.</P>
<P>And both at <HI>Constantinople, Aleppo,</HI> and other places of
Turkey where there is traffiking and trading of Merchants,
it is no rare matter for popish Christians of sundry other Coun∣tries,
to <HI>Cut Cabine,</HI> (as they call it) that is: to take any woman
of that contrie where they soiourne, (Turkish women onely ex∣cepted,
for it is death for a Christian to meddle with them) and
when they haue bought them, and enroled them in the <HI>Cadies</HI>
booke, to vse them as wiues so long as they soiourne in that
countrie, and maintaine them gallantly, to the consuming of
their wealth, diminishing of their health, and endangering of
their owne soules. And when they depart out of that Country,
they shake off these their swéet-hearts, &amp; leaue them to shift for
themselues and their children. And this they account no sinne,
or at least wise such a sinne as may be washed away with a litle
holy water.</P>
<P>And these are the vertues which many Christians learne by
soiourning long in Heathen Countries: which is not to be mar∣uelled
at; for if <HI>Ioseph</HI> (a good man) liuing in <HI>Pharaoh</HI> his Court,
had learned to sweare by the life of <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> (a great
Apostle) being in the high Priests hall but once, denied Christ
thrice; we may well thinke that they which dwell long in wic∣ked
Countries, and conuerse with wicked men, are somewhat
tainted with their sinnes, if not altogether sowred with the lea∣uen
of their vngodlinesse.</P>

<HEAD>Of those whom they call Franks or Free∣men,
soiourning in Aleppo.</HEAD>
<P>THE other sortes of Christians liuing in <HI>Aleppo</HI> are such
as are borne in other parts of Christendome, and onely so∣iourne
there for a time to vse trafficke and trade in merchandise,
and these are Englishmen, Italians, Frenchmen, Dutchmen,
and others, whom they call by a generall name <HI>Frangi,</HI> that is,
Franks, or Fréemen. For all the rest, euen from the greatest
Bashaw or Vizier vnto the poorest peasant, are slaues vnto the
Grand Signiour, who onely is free; and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est are borne,
brought vp, liue and die his slaues: for the Grand Signiour
can commaund the head of any one of them at his pleasure.</P>
<P>Yea, if some great Vizier or Bashawe to whom he hath com∣mitted
the gouernement of some Citie or countrie, fall into
his disfauour, if he send but a <HI>Cappagie,</HI> that is, a Pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to
him with his writing, with a blacke seale in a blacke boxe, none
of them all dare withstand him, but suffer this base C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppagie to
strangle him: though it be in the house before his wiues, chil∣dren
and seruants, yet none dare lift vp their hands against
him.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Bashawe</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who gouerned the Citie and
Countrie adioyning, who was in the disfauour of the King, and
the King sent a <HI>Cappagie</HI> to strangle him, who inquiring for the
Bashaws house at <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eppo.</HI> and vnderstanding he was at his
Garden foure miles from the Citie, he rode and met him in the
way, and opened his black box and shewed him his commission
to strangle him, whereat his countenance changed, and he only
craued this fauour, that hee might haue libertie to say his Prai∣ers
before he died: which performed, hee yéeldeth his head and
was strangled, sitting on his horse before all his followers,
which were at the least 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. men, and no man durst speake one
worde against it, much lesse offer to resist him, but said, it was
Gods will it should be so.</P>
<P>And not onely the great Turke doeth thus tyrannize ouer
<PB N="83" REF="54"/>
his slaues, but euery <HI>Bashaw</HI> who hath gouernment ouer o∣thers
in a Citie or Countrie, tyrannise ouer those which are
vnder their regiment, and sometimes strangled, sometimes be∣headed,
and sometines put vnto terrible tortures those who
offend. Yea, oftentimes without offense; onely because they
are rich and haue faire houses the <HI>Bashaw</HI> will lay to their
charge such things as he himselfe knoweth to be vntrue, and
put them to death that he may seaze vpon his goods.</P>
<P>There was a Sherife or a Green-headin <HI>Aleppo,</HI> whom they
account <HI>Mahomets</HI> kinred, who offending the <HI>Bashaw</HI> and bra∣uing
him in tearmes as thogh he durst not punish him, he caused
one of his officers to goe with him home, and when hee came
before his owne doore, openly in the street to break both his legs
and armes, &amp; there let him lie, and no man durst finde fault, or
giue him food; or Physician, or Chirurgion come to him; or wife
or seruants take him into house, but there he lay all day, and
should so haue continued vntill he had died for hunger, or dogs
eaten him, had not his friends giuen money to the <HI>Bashaw</HI> to
haue his throat cut to rid him out of his paine. And this is a
common punishment amonst them.</P>
<P>And somtimes for small offenses, they will lay a man downe
on his backe, and hoyse vp his féete, and with a cudgell giue
them 300. or 400. blowes on the soles of their féete, whereby ma∣nie
are lamed.</P>
<P>And some they set on a sharpe stake naked, which commeth
from his fundament vp to his mouth, if he find not fauour to
haue his throat cut sooner.</P>
<P>And some are ganched in this manner; they are drawen vp
by a rope fastened about their armes to the top of a Gazouke or
Gibbet full of hookes, and let downwards againe, and on what
part soeuer any hooke taketh hold, by that they hang vntill they
die for hunger.</P>
<P>And some in like sort are drawen ouer a Gibbet, and they be∣ing
compassed about the naked waste with a small coard, the
coard is drawen by 2. men to make them draw vp their breath,
and still pulled straiter and straiter, vntill they bee so narow
in the waste, that they may easily be cut off by the middle at one
<PB N="84" REF="55"/>
blow, and then the vpper part is let downe on a hot grid-iron
and there seared vp, to kéepe them in sense and feeling of paine
so long as is possible, and the neather part is throwen to the
dogges, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Vnspeakeable is their tyranny to those that fall into their
hands, not vnlike the tyrannie of the Spaniards towards the
poore <HI>Indians</HI> who neuer offend them.</P>
<P>They, whom they call Franks or Fréemen, liue in greater
securitie amongst them then their owne people, by reason that
they are gouerned by Consuls of their owne nation, and those
Consuls also are backed by Ambassadours for the same nations
which are alwaies Leige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at <HI>Constantinople:</HI> and when their
Consuls abroad are offered wrong, they write vnto the Ambas∣sadours,
how, and by whom they are wronged: and then the
Ambassadour procureth from the great Turk commandements
to the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of <HI>Aleppo</HI> to redresse their wrongs, and punish
such as offend them. Otherwise there were no dwelling for
Franks amongst them, but they should be vsed like slaues by e∣uery
slaue.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding their Consuls and Ambassadours too,
yet they are oftentimes abused by Turks both in words and
deeds.</P>
<P>In words they reuile them as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did the <HI>Israelites,</HI>
and call them <HI>Gours,</HI> that is, <HI>Infidels:</HI> and <HI>Cupec,</HI> that is, dog:
and <HI>Canzier,</HI> that is, Hogge: and by many other odious and re∣proachfull
names. And though they strike them, yet dare they
not strike againe lest they loose their hand, or be worse vsed.</P>
<P>They also oftentimes make <HI>Auenias</HI> of them, that is, false
accusations; and suborne false witnesses to confirme it to bee
true: and no Christians word will bee take against a Turke,
for they account vs infidels, and call themselues <HI>Musselmen,</HI>
that is, True beléeuers.</P>
<P>This miserie abroad will make bs loue our owne Contrie
the better when wee come thither. And that is the best lesson
which I haue learned in my trauels, <HI>Mundi contemptum,</HI> that
is, <HI>The contempt of the world.</HI> And S. <HI>Pauls</HI> lesson, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 11.

to transport my Letters vnto you: Nothing doubting

being my voyage from <HI>Aleppo</HI> in <HI>Syria Comagena</HI> to
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> vndertaken this present yéere 1600. not mooued as
Pilgrimes with any superstitious deuotion to see Relikes, or
worship such places as they account holy; but as Trauellers
and Merchants, occasioned by dearth and sicknesse, pestilence
and famine in the City where we soiourne: which two are such
followlike companions, that the <HI>Graecians</HI> distinguish them
but by one letter, calling the pestilence <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the famine <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:
By reason whereof all trafficke was hindred, and those Mer∣chants
whom they call <HI>Frankes</HI> or <HI>Freemen,</HI> either remooued to
other places; or such as staied in the City, caused their gates to
be shut vp, and came not abroad vntill <HI>Sol</HI> entered into <HI>Leo,</HI>
which is vsually the twelfth or thirtéenth day of Iuly, at which

sicknesse, nor refuse any mans company infected therewith;
for they say euery mans fortune is written in his forehead, and
that they shall not die before their time; not knowing what it is
to tempt God, and to refuse ordinarie meanes. But in this <HI>in∣terim,</HI>
from the beginning of this sicknesse (which was in <HI>March</HI>)
vntill the expected and vndoubted end, when the Sunne enter∣eth

seuen or eight miles, to bring vs on the way, and then retur∣ned

vs to <HI>Cane Toman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cane Toman.</NOTE> ten miles from <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where wée made
merry with such good chéere as we brought with vs. For there
was nothing to be had for money but goats milke, whereof
we had as much as we would. Heere we purposed to haue slept
all night, but hauing no other beds but the hard ground, with
<HI>Iacobs</HI> pillow (a good hard stone) vnder our heads, vnaccusto∣med
to such Downe beds, we could not sléepe, but spent the
time in honest mirth vntill it was past midnight, and then our
friends tooke their leaue of vs, and returned towards <HI>Aleppo,</HI>
and we procéeded in our iourney towards <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> The night
being darke, and the way dangerous and théeuish, our <HI>Ienesa∣rie,
Byram Bashaw,</HI> willed vs euery one to take a match lighted
in our hands, and to whirle it about, that the fire might be
séene the further, to terrifie the théeues, lest they should surprise
vs on the sudden. And when we came to suspicious places (as
caues, rockes, barnes, or odde Cottages in the way) our <HI>Iene∣sarie</HI>
vsed to ride before; and as fowlers beat vpon bushes for
birds, so he (with his launce) would strike and beat vpon such
places, lest wilde <HI>Arabs</HI> (which lie lurking in such places) should
steale vpon vs on the sudden.</P>
<P>When the day appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saracoope.</NOTE> our way was pleasant and comfor∣table
vnto vs, vntill we came to a village called <HI>Saracoope,</HI> whi∣ther
we came about noone, March. 10. And because our Seise∣nars
or sumptor horses (which caried prouision for man and
horse, as the custome of the Countrie is) were tyred, and wee
our selues also (for want of sléepe the night past) wearied and
hungrie, wee were constrained to lodge there all night on the
hard ground by our horse héeles, in an old Cane distant from
<HI>Cane Toman</HI> 28. miles.</P>
<P>March. 11. betimes in the morning we departed frō <HI>Saracoop,</HI>

(commonly called <HI>Morat) Chillabee,</HI> sometimes <HI>Defterdare,</HI> that

that all Trauellers that way should haue their entertainement

which our Ienesaries accepted off; but we scorning reliefe from

other good things for money. <HI>Marrah</HI> is distant from <HI>Saracoope</HI>

<P>March 12.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacmine.</NOTE> was a very rainy day, yet we trauelled all the

farre off made shew of a very faire village; but when we came
thither, we found it so ruinous, that there was not one house a∣ble
to shroude vs from the extremitie of the shower: the inha∣bitants
thereof hauing forsaken it and fled into the mountaines
to dwell, for feare of the Ienesaries of <HI>Damascus,</HI> who trauel∣ling
that way vsed to take from them, not onely victuals for
themselues, and prouender for their horses without money,
but whatsoeuer things els they found in their houses. Onely
there was a little Church or Chappel there in good preparation,
whereinto (for a little money) we obtained leaue to enter, our
selues with our horses and carriage, and there we brought out
our victuals, and refreshed our selues, and baited our horses,
and rested vntill it left raining. After the shower, while our
horses were preparing, we walked into the fields néere vnto the
Church, and saw many poore people gathering Mallas and thrée
leafed grasse, and asked them what they did with it: and they
answered, that it was all their foode; and that they boiled it,
and did eate it: then we tooke pitie on them, &amp; gaue them bread,
which they receiued very ioyfully, and blessed God that there
was bread in the world, and said: they had not séene any bread
the space of many moneths. We also gaue vnto them small
pieces of siluer to relieue their necessitie, which they receiued
gratefully, and wished that their Countrie were in the hands of
Christians againe.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="58"/>
The shower ceasing, we rode from this Chappell and village
of Lacke money (I should haue said <HI>Lacmin,</HI> but might say,
lacke men and money too) and rode forward vntill we came vn∣to
a village or towne called <HI>Tyaba,</HI> where (because it was neere
night) we desired to lodge, but could not be admitted into any
house for any money, whereupon our chiefe Ienesarie <HI>Byram

and childe out of the house, that we might bring in our horses,
and lodge there our selues. But when we saw what pitifull la∣mentation
they made, we intreated our <HI>Ienesarie</HI> either to per∣swade
them for money, or to let them alone. And vnderstan∣ding
that there w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a faire City in our way, ten miles off, we
fiue, with our <HI>Ienesarie</HI> being well horsed, rode thither, and left

<P>This City is now commonly called <HI>Aman,</HI> but of old it was

but on the cold ground, and vpon the hard stones, and thought
our selues well prouided for, that we had an house ouer our
heads to keepe vs day. Héere we met with victuals for money,
and prouender for our horses. On the morrow, the rest of our
company came vnto vs from <HI>Tyaba,</HI> and one of our horses be∣ing
lame, we staied there all that day to buy another, and met
there that day another swaggering <HI>Ienesarie</HI> of <HI>Damascus,</HI> of
our old acquaintance at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> called <HI>Mahomet Bashaw,</HI> who
came from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> with <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants, whom he had

to come of the posteritie of <HI>Esay.</HI> And some thinke him to haue
béene the sonne of <HI>Abram</HI> by <HI>Ketura.</HI> Yet might this City, now
called <HI>Hemse</HI> or <HI>Hus,</HI> be the Land of one called by name <HI>Hus:</HI>
for I doe finde in the Genealogies of the holy Scripture, thrée
men of that name <HI>Hus:</HI></P>
<P>One was <HI>Arams</HI> sonne, nephew to <HI>Noah, Gen.</HI> 10. 23.</P>
<P>A second was <HI>Nachors, Abrams</HI> brothers sonne by <HI>Milchah,

not vnlikely that some one of these thrée might haue dwelt at
this place in <HI>Syria,</HI> called <HI>Hus,</HI> which by corruption of time was
called <HI>Hemse.</HI></P>
<P>On the fiftéenth day of March we went from <HI>Hus</HI> towards
<HI>Damascus,</HI> which is foure daies iourney off, and all the way
(vntill we came within ten miles of <HI>Damascus</HI>) is a desart, vn∣inhabited,
and a théeuish way; onely there are erected in the
way certaine Canes to lodge in. But if they bring not prouisi∣on
with them both for man and horse, and some quilt or pillow
to sléepe on, the hard stones must be their bed, and the aire their
supper: for some of their Canes are nothing but stone wals to
kéepe out théeues. In Cities they haue very stately Canes, but
not for Trauellers, but for themselues to dwell in; for euerie
rich man calleth his house a Cane. But the Canes that stand in
high waies, are in charity erected by great men, for the prote∣ction
of Trauellers; but most of them are very badly kept, and
are worse than stables. Our first daies iourney from <HI>Hus</HI> was
a very vncomfortable and dangerous desart: we saw no house
all the way vntill we came vnto a village called <HI>Hassia,</HI> where

<P><PB N="92" REF="59"/>
March 16. From <HI>Hassia,</HI> we rode to an ancient Christian

but gouerned by <HI>Turks</HI> only. There is but one Church in the
Towne, which is dedicated to <HI>S. Nicolas,</HI> by the Christians,
who first builded it. But both Christians and Turkes pray
therein: the Christians on the one side or Ile of the Church, and
the Turkes on the other. But the Christians are ouer ruled
by the Turkes, and constrained to finde them oile to their lamps
in the Church. For the Turkes not only burne lamps in their
Churches euery night, but during the whole time of their Lent
they beset the battlements of their steeples round about with
lampes. But when their Lent is ended, they burne lampes in
their stéeples onely once a wéeke, and that is on Thursday at
night, which is the Eue before their Sabboth. After we had
refreshed our selues héere, halfe the day being not yet spent, we
rode from hence to a poore village called <HI>Nebecke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nebeck.</NOTE> or (as they
pronounce it) <HI>Nebhkeh,</HI> where we lodged in an old Cane, di∣stant
from <HI>Hassio</HI> 27. miles.</P>
<P>And vnderstanding at this place, that the way that we were
to passe on the morrow, was full of <HI>Arabs,</HI> and that two daies
before, many men were found in the way killed by them, wée
feared to goe any further. Yet meeting with company contra∣rie
to expectation (March 17.) we went forwards, and saw no
house nor company all the day long besides our selues, vntil we
came to a village called <HI>Cotifey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotifey.</NOTE> where wee lodged in a very
stately new Cane, built by <HI>Synan Bashaw;</HI> and not altogether
finished. This Cane doth far exceed that at <HI>Marrah</HI> (before men∣tioned)
for herunto is adioyned a fair new Church and a Bazar,
that is a Market place where trauellers may buy many good
things. Heere is also meat for trauellers, and prouender for
their horses to be had of the founders cost. And in the middle of
this Cane, there is a faire large fountaine of water, of hewed
stones foure square, wherein there is excéeding good water for
Trauellers to drinke, and chambers for their lodging: but if
they will haue any beds, they must bring them with them, or
<PB N="93" REF="60"/>
sléepe on the hard ground, as most men that trauell that way
are wont to doe.</P>
<P>March 18. From <HI>Cotifey</HI> we had not much more than 20.
miles to <HI>Dama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cus.</HI> The first ten miles was a desart and dan∣gerous
way, and we hardly escaped danger; for an <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian</HI>
horsman seeing vs come, stood as a spie in our way, to view our
strength, and marked euery one of vs very narrowly, and what
weapons we had; and then rode vp an high mountaine as fast
as if it had beene plaine ground, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o acquaint his companions
what a prey he had found for them. Whereupon our <HI>Ienesarie</HI>
cast aside his vpper garment, being a gambe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>looke, and bad vs
all make ready our weapons, and he himselfe rode before vs
with his launce on his shoulders, expecting there comming vp∣on
vs suddenly: but they hauing esp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed (from the top of the
mountaine) fifty <HI>Ienesarie,</HI> of <HI>Dama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cus</HI> at the least, with their
I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmoglans comming after vs, came not, and so by the proui∣dence
of God we escaped their hands.</P>
<P>The other part of our way to <HI>Damascus</HI> was a pleasant plain
of ten miles in length, hauing many fruitfull oillages, fine ri∣uers,
and pleasant gardens thereon. At our entrance into this
plaine or valley, riding downe an hill, we beheld the prospect
of <HI>Damascus</HI> ten miles off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damascus.</NOTE> whither we came about two of the
clocke in the afternoone, and tooke vp our lodging in the middle
of the City, at a Cane called in <HI>Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>co, Cane Nebbe,</HI> that is,
the Cane of the Prophet; but by the Turkes, <HI>Cane Haramin,</HI>
where we hired three chambers for our mony, and our seruants
bought our meat, and dressed it themselues, as they did also all
the rest of the way where we could get any thing. To this end
we tooke a Cooke with vs, and other seruants from <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eppo,</HI> to
dresse our meat, and to looke to our horses. Héere we met with
Frenchmen, and other Christians, staying for company to go
to <HI>Ierus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lem.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Damascus</HI> many Iewish Merchants, and Gréekes, and

vs with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good things as they had, both wine, and bread,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd fruit, &amp;c. and lent vs very good beds, with sheets

<P><PB N="94" REF="60"/>
March 19. and 20. we staied at <HI>Damascus</HI> to rest our selues,
and see the City.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Damascus.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAmascus</HI> is a most ancient City, and as <HI>Esay</HI> spake of it in
his time, <HI>The head of Aram is Damascus: Isa.</HI> 7. 8. so <HI>Da∣mascus</HI>
is the chiefest City of <HI>Syria</HI> to this day. The situation
thereof is most pleasant, being built on a plaine ground, strong∣ly
walled about, and a strong Castle therein, with many fine
riuers running on euery side of it, especially <HI>Abanah</HI> and <HI>Phar∣par,</HI>
mentioned 2. <HI>King.</HI> 5. which now are diuided into many
heads.</P>
<P>The Turkes say, that their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> was once at
<HI>Damascus,</HI> and that when he saw the pleasant situation of it,
and beheld the stately prospect of it, excelling all others that e∣uer
he saw before; refused to enter into the City, lest the plea∣santnesse
thereof should rauish him, and moue him there to set∣tle
an earthly Paradise, and hinder his desire of the heauenly
Paradise.</P>
<P>It hath also many pleasant Orchards and gardens round a∣bout
the Citie, and some waies for the space of a mile and more
about the citie there are many Orchards, and great varietie of
fruites: some called <HI>Adam,</HI> apples, and <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms</HI> figs, &amp; sundry o∣ther
strange fruites. <HI>Damascus</HI> is called by the Turkes <HI>Sham,</HI>
and they call it the garden of Turkey, because there is no place
in all the Turkes dominions (especially in <HI>Syria,</HI> that yeeldeth
such abundance of fruit. Heere we stated two daies and three
nights to rest our selues, and see the Citie. And hauing a
Greeke to our guide, hee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hewed vs first a stately Muskia, or
Turkish Church erected in the place where the Temple of <HI>Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mon</HI>
stoode, mentioned 2 King. 5. And two other memorable
matters, mentioned <HI>Act.</HI> 9. 25. <HI>viz.</HI> the place where the Disci∣ples
let downe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the night through the wall in a basket,
whereof the Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Keepe an eract memori∣all;
taking vpon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to demo: strate the very place of the wal;
which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> bek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, they confirmed it with this reason, that
<PB N="95" REF="61"/>
<HI>Damascus</HI> was neuer ouercome; and that there haue béene
Christians dwelling there euer since the time of <HI>Paul,</HI> and there∣fore
might keepe a memoriall of the very place: But to let the
place passe, the thing it selfe we know to be true.</P>
<P>He shewed vs also the house of <HI>Ananias,</HI> which is vnder the
ground, whereinto we were led, downe a paire of staires from
the stréete, as it were into a Celler; and the dore being vnlocked,
wee entred with candels into the place, where wee sawe two
darke chambers, where a man cannot see to reade in the day
time without candels; here they say, he liued in secret for feare
of the Iewes. Many Christians comming thither to sée that
place, with a coale write their names on the wall, and there are
so many names there already, that there is scarce roome for any
other to set his name.</P>
<P>Some of them report <HI>Damascus</HI> to be built in the place where
<HI>Kain</HI> killed his brother <HI>Abel.</HI> And some say it is néere it, and of∣fered
to bring vs to the place; but we refused.</P>
<P>They take vpon them also at <HI>Damascus</HI> to demonstrate the
place where S. <HI>George</HI> was buried, so they do likewise at <HI>Alep∣po,</HI>
but I thinke the one to be as true as the other.</P>
<P>There is a fine towne néere vnto <HI>Damascus,</HI> about two or
thrée miles distant on the side of an hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salhia.</NOTE> called <HI>Salhia,</HI> from
whence a man may behold the prospect of the Citie of <HI>Damascus</HI>
most pleasantly, with the gardens and pleasant places about it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Damascus</HI> we met many thousand Turkes going on Pil∣grimage
towards <HI>Mecha</HI> in <HI>Arabia</HI> to visit <HI>Mahomets</HI> sepulchre,
as they vsually doe euery yéere about their <HI>Byram</HI> time; for
they hold that whosoeuer once in his life time shall not goe on
Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha,</HI> to sée the sepulcher of their Prophet, shall
neuer enter into Paradise. And therefore some of them goe
thither often in their life time, partly for deuotion, and partly
to buy merchandise. For there are brought thither at that time
of the yéere, great store of commodities from <HI>India, Persia,</HI> and o∣ther
places; and none may by or sell there but <HI>Mahome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans.</HI>
And it is forbidden to all Christians vpon paine of death to
come néere <HI>Mecha</HI> within fiue miles: partly, lest they should
marre their markets; but chiefly, lest they should see their folly
<PB N="96" REF="61"/>
or rather madnesse in worshipping an iron sepulcher, after the
sight whereof, many of their old men (which thinke neuer to
come thither againe) vse to pull out both their eyes, after they
haue seene so holy a sight (as they accout it) as their Prophets
sepulcher, and thinke thereby to inherit heauen.</P>
<Q><L>Tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum.</L></Q>
<P>that is:</P>
<Q><L>In such shamefull sort themselues to deface,</L>
<L>Their Religion mooues them for want of grace:</L></Q>
<P>And whosoeuer (say they) dieth in his pilgrimage thither,
or returning from thence, is sure to goe to Heauen presently.
And they that haue béene there but once, are alwaies after cal∣led
<HI>Hogies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hogies.</NOTE> that is, Pilgrimes: and are called by that name in
this manner.</P>
<P>If his name before were <HI>Mahomet,</HI> he is at his returne cal∣led
<HI>Hogie Mahomet.</HI> If before <HI>Mustapha,</HI> he is alwaies after
called <HI>Hogie Mustapha, &amp;c.</HI> And they that haue béene often at
<HI>Mecha</HI> and returne againe, are called great <HI>Hogies.</HI> And euery
yéere when the Carauan of Pilgrimes returneth from <HI>Mecha,</HI>
he that hath béene there oftnest is called <HI>The great Hogie:</HI> and
is greatly honoured of them all, for he rideth before them all in
more stately apparell then they, with flowers and garlands a∣bout
his horse, and when they come néere any great Citie, the
chiefest men in the citie ride foorth to méet him, and bring him
into the Citie with great solemnitie.</P>
<P>They falsly affirme that this their Temple at <HI>Mecha</HI> in <HI>Arabia</HI>
was built by <HI>Abraham,</HI> and they prepare themselues with grea∣ter
care to goe to worship there, then many Christians do when
they come to the Lords Supper; for they disburden their hearts
of all hatred and malice, and reconcile themselues one to ano∣ther,
&amp;c. Otherwise they hold that all their labour is lost, and
that they shalbe neuer a whit the better for their Pilgrimage.
But if they forgiue one another, and repent them for their for∣mer
sinnes, they thinke there to obtaine ful remission of all their
sinnes, and that at their returne they are pure and without
spot.</P>
<P>March 21. We departed from the City of <HI>Damascus,</HI> and a∣bout
<PB N="97" REF="62"/>
fiue or six miles from the City, passed by a village called
<HI>Daria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Daria.</NOTE> néere vnto which we saw a great multitude of men, wo∣men,
and children on their knees in the high way: and by that
tune they had ended their deuotion, we drew so neere as to sa∣lute
them; and asking what they were, it was told vs that they
were all Christians of sundry Nations, <HI>viz. Armenians, Greeks,
Chelfalmes, Nostranes,</HI> and sundry others, who went to <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI>
to visit and worship the holy places there. We asked fur∣ther,
what they meant to fall on their knées in that place: they
answered vs, that it was the place where<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mucro, furor Sauh, liber est conue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sio Pauli.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> was conuerted,
and that it was their custome when they trauelled that way, to
fall on their knees, and pray vnto God to conuert them. They
were in number at the least foure or fiue hundred people. There
was a Greeke Patriarke, and an Armenian Bishop in their
company. Many of them knew vs, (hauing séene vs in <HI>Alep∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>)
and saluted vs by our names. We rode a while in compa∣ny
together, and lodged all together that night at a Cane called
<HI>Sassa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sassa.</NOTE> distant from <HI>Dama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cus</HI> 26. miles.</P>
<P>March 22. We rode before the rest of the company. Our
way that we trauelled all this day was exceeding bad, rocky,
watrish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabia Petr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a.</NOTE> and barren, called <HI>Arabia Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea,</HI> where our horses
often times stucke fast in the puddles and miry places, and
sometimes ready to breake their owne legs, and their Riders
necks among rocks and stones. It was neither pleasant go∣ing
on foot, nor riding this way, for there was no path nor euen
ground, but huge stones and rocks so néere together, that our
horses could goe but a foot pace, and often times met with such
marishes and quagmires, that we were constrained to goe
farre about before we could finde better waies to passe ouer.
It is also exceeding cold in this place alwaies (in respect of other
places in that Country) for there are neither trées, nor houses,
nor high hils to keepe away the violence and force of the winds.
The Carauans that trauel vsually that way betwixt <HI>Damascus</HI>
and <HI>Egypt,</HI> say that this daies iourney troubleth them more
than all the rest, and that they neuer passe by that way, but
they leaue two or three of their Cammels behinde them, some
misfortune or other befalling vnto them. We saw also in sun∣drie
<PB N="98" REF="62"/>
places this way, the carcases of many dead cammels which
haue miscarried amongst the rocks. It is also a very théeuish
way, full of wilde <HI>Arabs:</HI> yet (by the prouidence of God) wee
came safely that day to <HI>Conetra,</HI> where we lodged in a good
Cane, distant from <HI>Sassa</HI> 28. miles.</P>
<P>After our tedious trauell to <HI>Conetra,</HI> finding the place plea∣sant
at our comming thither, we walked about to solace our
selues in beholding the gréene pastures and running riuers nere
vnto it, and in viewing the order of sundry Nations there as∣sembled
together from sundry places. Some comming from
<HI>Egypt,</HI> and bound to <HI>Damascus,</HI> pitched their tents without the
Cane, néere vnto the riuer. Others comming from <HI>Damascus,</HI>
and bound to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> accommodated themselues (in such
sort as they could) within the Cane. But especially in a Bazar
(like vnto a cloister) adioining to the Cane, wee tooke plea∣sure
to walke vp and downe some few turns, which the Turks
beholding, wondred at vs: (for it is not their custome in those
hot Countries to walke vp and downe as we doe in cold Coun∣tries,
but to sit still on the ground like brute beasts) and one of
them came vnto vs, and asked vs what we meant to walke vp
and downe in such sort, and whether we were out of our way,
or out of our wits. If your way (said he) lieth toward the vp∣per
end of the cloister, why come you downwards? And if at
the netherend, why goe you backe againe? We answered him,
For our pleasure. He replied, that it was greater pleasure to
sit still, than to walke vp and downe when we néed not. But
their brutish sitting stil on the ground was as strange vnto vs,
as our walking vp and downe was to them.</P>
<P>It séemed no lesse strange vnto them to sée a Christian with
a cut dublet: and they called him foole, and asked him what hée
meant to make holes in his coat: for they neither cut nor pinke
any of their garments, but weare them all plaine, sparing for
no cost to guard them with lace of siluer and gold if they be able.</P>
<P>And such as weare long haire on their heads, the Turkes
call slouens, and account them sauage beasts; for they them∣selues
weare no haire on their heads at all, but shaue them eue∣ry
wéeke once, and kéepe them warme with a Turbant of white
<PB N="99" REF="63"/>
shash made of cotten woole, which they neuer vncouer in their
salutations to any man, but bow their heads, with their hands
on their breasts.</P>
<P>But if a man haue a faire long beard, they reuerence him,
and say he is a wise man, and an honourable personage. But
if they haue no beards at all, they call them (if they be yoong)
<HI>Bardasses,</HI> that is <HI>Sodomiticall boies.</HI> But if they be men grow∣en,
and haue no beards, they call them fooles, and men of no
credit; and some of them refuse to buy or sell with such, and
say they haue no wit, and that they will not beléeue them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>March 23. We had a more pleasant way; for the first ten
miles wée rode thorow the fields and a very pleasant Parke.
But when wée came out of this Parke or Forest, wee were
somewhat troubled, partly by reason of the bad way, and part∣lie
by bad people in the way. The way was stony and rockie
(as the former daies iourney was) but yet dry, and not long,
for it was but the descending downe a rockie hill, where though
the way were dangerous vnder our féet, yet it was pleasant be∣fore
our faces, for wée beheld the prospect of part of the holy
Land, <HI>viz. Galile.</HI></P>
<P>But at our desending downe this mountaine, the people did
more trouble vs then the way; for there sate amongst the rocks
in our way many <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabs,</HI> with maces of Iron and o∣ther
weapons, who staied vs and demanded <HI>Caphar</HI> or tole mo∣ney;
we were glad to giue them content that wée might passe
safely by them, as <HI>Iacob</HI> was glad to send his brother <HI>Esau</HI> gifts,
for a <HI>Ne noceat</HI> (as the Lawyers speake) that is, for feare of dan∣ger.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Carauan</HI> of Christians, who came after vs, though
they were many hundreds, yet some of them being not able,
some not willing to pay so much mony as they demanded, were
shrewdly beaten with their iron mases. There was a <HI>Iesuite</HI>
in their company, who escaped not without stripes, whereat
(as I haue heard) he reioiced, and counted it meritorious, in
that he suffered such misery in so holy a voyage. And in my hea∣ring,
at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> one of his companions told him, that he meri∣ted
much to susteine such trauell and labour, and be at so great
<PB N="100" REF="63"/>
cost and charges, and suffer so many stripes for Christs sake:
But I know, had it not béene more for loue of his purse than for
loue of Christ, he might haue escaped without stripes, yea
with these kinde speeches, <HI>Marhabbah Ianum,</HI> that is, <HI>Welcome
my friend or sweet-heart.</HI></P>
<P>At another place in my trauels I heard a Friar bragging of
his good workes, and saying, that hée had done so many good
workes, that if he should kill thrée men, his good works would
make satisfaction, and merit remission for them all. To whom
one in my company answered, that by his murder he might
merit indéed a double reward, <HI>viz.</HI> death in this life, and dam∣nation
in the life to come, for blood will haue blood; For whoso∣euer
sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed. But
to let passe these <HI>Iesuiticall Iebusites,</HI> or <HI>Iebusiticall Iesuites:</HI> In
that these trauellers were thus beaten for sparing their purses,
and though they were many hundreds, durst not strike them
againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An admoni∣tion for Tra∣uellers.</NOTE> héere I may fitly take occasion to teach those that pur∣pose
to trauell into Turkey, how to behaue themselues. If
they be set vpon by théeues, they may defend themselues in
their trauels, if they be strong enough; but if they be poling of∣ficers
(as these were) they must not be contradicted. But nei∣ther
in their Cities, nor in their trauels, may they strike againe
though they be abused and beaten by any man (except they be
théeues and robbers) for if they doe, they shall either be put to
death, or haue their hand cut off. Neither if a man receiue a
box on the eare at any of their hands, must he giue one bad
word, or looke frowningly vpon him that smote him: for then
he will strike him againe, and say, What, <HI>Goure?</HI> Doest thou
curse me, and wish that the Deuill had me? But he must kisse
his beard, or the skirt of his garment, and smile vpon him, and
then he will let him passe.</P>
<P>Wherefore, trauellers into those parts must looke vpon the
picture of a seruant as of old he was wont to be painted, that
thereby they may learne how to behaue themselues in trauell.</P>
<P>I read, that of old they were wont to paint the picture of a
seruant at the doores of their houses, that their seruants might
sée how they should behaue themselues. And he was painted on
<PB N="101" REF="64"/>
this manner; With the snout of a Swine, the eares of an Asse,
the feet of an Hart, with hands open, with his garments clean∣ly,
and on his head a bonnet, hauing on his backe a coulestaffe,
with two vessels, the one hauing in it fire, the other water.</P>
<P>This description, though it be rude and homely, yet it tea∣cheth
plainly seruants and trauellers their duties.</P>
<P>The Swines snout declareth that they must not be daintie
mouthed, but must be content with any meat which God hath
prouided for man.</P>
<P>The Asses eares, that they must patiently heare the sharpe
speeches of their Masters, without answering againe.</P>
<P>The Harts féet, that they must be swift in doing their bu∣sinesse.</P>
<P>Their Hands wide open, that they must be faithfull, not
deceitfull: They must doe nothing closely or secretly: They
must haue their chests, their hands, their hearts open to their
Masters eie and commandement, when it pleaseth him to call
them to account.</P>
<P>Their garments comely and honest, which their bonnet de∣clares,
that they must not be slouenly, but handsome and séem∣ly
apparelled, and yet not proudly aboue their degrées.</P>
<P>The coulestaffe on their shoulder, that they must not refuse
to doe any worke, no not to carry water.</P>
<P>And the fire and water, the one before them, and the other
behinde, sheweth their discretion in their businesse: They must
not mingle fire and water together.</P>
<P>Most of these qualities are required in Trauellers. In diet
they must not be dainty, but eat what they can get. Their
eares must not be nice, for they shall heare speeches enough to
offend them. Their féet must be swift to flie from dangers:
Their hands wide open to giue liberally: Their apparell also
must be neat in Cities where they soiourne, for their credit:
But when they trauell abroad, it must be simple, for their safe∣ty:
for the baser their apparell is, the better shall they passe:
for if they weare good apparell, their throats will be cut for
their apparell, and hope of much money: for those that go braue
they account rich. And whereas in seruants it is commendable
<PB N="102" REF="64"/>
to haue asses eares; in trauellers it is néedfull to haue asses
backes also, to beare all abuses in good part, and rather to beare
an hundreth abuses then to offer one.</P>
<P>Wherfore seruants and trauellers must alwaies remember
this Distichon, or couple of verses following.</P>
<Q><L>Nobile vincendi genus est patientia, vincit</L>
<L>Qui patitur: sivis vincere, discepati:</L></Q>
<P>that is,</P>
<Q><L>A noble kind of conquering</L>
<L>is patience to see and heare:</L>
<L>He which forbeareth, conquereth,</L>
<L>If thou wilt conquer, learne to beare.</L></Q>
<P>But to leaue these matters, and to procéede to my voiage.
At the foote of this mountaine there is an old Cane where v∣sually
trauellers lodge: but it béeing not yet noone, we resolued
to trauell 18 miles further, to the Sea of <HI>Galile.</HI> At the foote of
this stony hill, hard by this Cane, there runneth a pleasant ri∣uer,
which diuideth <HI>Siria</HI> from <HI>Galile.</HI> And ouer this riuer
there is a fair bridge, the one end whereof is out of the holy land,
the other in it. This riuer is called <HI>Iordane,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iordan.</NOTE> the head whereof
commeth from <HI>Mount Libanus,</HI> and maketh three Seas.</P>
<P>The first is the waters of <HI>Maron</HI> which wee left on our right
hand, about ten miles off. The other on the left hand, which lay
in our waie as we should trauell.</P>
<P>The second is the sea of <HI>Galile,</HI> or <HI>Tiberias,</HI> or lake of <HI>Gene∣zereth.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the Sea of <HI>Sodome,</HI> called <HI>Mare mortuum,</HI> where
the riuer <HI>Iordan</HI> endeth.</P>
<P>The bridge that crosseth this Riuer <HI>Iordan</HI> at the entrance
into the holy land, is called <HI>Iacobs</HI> bridge; for two causes.</P>
<P>First, it is said that there <HI>Iacob</HI> met his brother <HI>Esau.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, that there <HI>Iacob</HI> wrestled with an Angel.</P>

<HEAD>A description of the Holy Land.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Holy Land of old was called <HI>Chanaan,</HI> and it
was deuided into thrée parts, <HI>viz. Galile, Iudea</HI> &amp; <HI>Pale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tina.</HI>
Later writers haue called all by the name of <HI>Palestina.</HI> The first
<PB N="103" REF="65"/>
part of <HI>Canaan</HI> called <HI>Galile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iacobs bridge.</NOTE> beginneth at this bridge, and to
this day it is a very pleasant and fruitful Countrie. After wee
were entred into <HI>Galile</HI> about 2. miles from the bridge, our <HI>Ie∣nesarie</HI>
asked vs whether we would go vp to a mountaine, and
so to <HI>Saphetta</HI> neere vnto mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> which is a place of lea∣ning
for Iewes; or keepe the lower way, and goe by the sea of
<HI>Galile,</HI> which is the pleasanter way: and thereof we made choise;
and tooke <HI>Saphetta</HI> in our way afterwards.</P>
<P>About seuen miles from <HI>Iacobs</HI> bridge, our guide brought
vs to a well, adorned with marble pillers, and couered with
stone, which he said to haue beene the pit whereinto <HI>Ioseph</HI> was
put when his brethren sold him to the <HI>Ishmalites.</HI> But it seemed
to vs incredible: first, because that was a dry pit, and this is ful
of sweet water.</P>
<P>Againe, <HI>Iacob</HI> dwelt at <HI>Hebron</HI> twelue miles beyond <HI>Ierusa∣lem,</HI>
and his sonnes kept shéepe in <HI>Shechem.</HI> And that dry pit
whereinto they put <HI>Ioseph</HI> was at <HI>Dothan</HI> (which we saw after∣wards)
And this pit which they shewed vs with marble pil∣lars,
was in <HI>Galile;</HI> not néere <HI>Dothan</HI> nor <HI>Shechem</HI> where <HI>Io∣sephs</HI>
brethren kept their fathers sheepe.</P>
<P>But by others of better iudgement wee vnderstood that
this also was called <HI>Ioseps</HI> pit, or well, because it was built by
one <HI>Iosph,</HI> not <HI>Ioseph</HI> the sonne of <HI>Iacob,</HI> but some other. But
the ignorant people which trauell that way, are apt to beleeue
any things that is told them. About ten miles from this well,
we came to a Cane called by the Moores <HI>Minium,</HI> but by the
Turkes <HI>Missia,</HI> hard by the sea of <HI>Galile,</HI> where we lodged all
night, hauing trauelled that day by computation 36. miles.</P>
<P>The foure and twentieth of March we rode along by the Sea
of <HI>Galile,</HI> which, <HI>Iohn</HI> 6. 1. is called by two mames, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sea
of <HI>Galile</HI> or <HI>Tiberias. Galile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Galile.</NOTE> because it is in <HI>Galile:</HI> and <HI>Tibe∣rias,</HI>
because the City <HI>Tiberias</HI> was built by it, and <HI>Bethsaida</HI>
an other ancient City; of both which we saw some ruinous
Wals. And it is said in that Chapter (<HI>Iohn</HI> 6. 1.) that Iesus
went ouer the Sea of <HI>Galile:</HI> and in an other place that he went
beyond the Lake. And <HI>Luke</HI> 9. 10. It is said, that hée went
into a slitary place, neere vnto a Citie called <HI>Bethsaida,</HI> which
<PB N="104" REF="65"/>
place of <HI>Iohn</HI> I learned to vnderstand better by seeing it, then e∣uer
I could before by reading of it. For, séeing that <HI>Tiberias</HI>
and <HI>Bethsaida</HI> were both Cities on the same side of the Sea, and
Christ went from <HI>Tiberias</HI> too, or neere vnto <HI>Bethsaida;</HI> I ga∣ther
thereby that our Sauiour Christ went not ouer the length
or breadth of that Sea; but ouer some Arme, bosome or reach
thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> so farre as <HI>Tiberias</HI> was distant from <HI>Bethsaida;</HI>
which is also confirmed in that it is said elswhere, <HI>A great mul∣titude
followed him on foot thither;</HI> which they could not haue
done if he had gone quite ouer the Sea, to the other side among
the <HI>Gergelens,</HI> which is out of the holy Land. And therfore this
Sea of <HI>Galile,</HI> is also called the Lake of <HI>Genesereth,</HI> because the
Countrey of the <HI>Cergesens</HI> is on the other side the Lake, from
whence the Swine ran headlong into the Sea and were choa∣ked
therein: and as that place was out of the holy Land; so the
people which then inhabited it, were as far from holines, when
they requested our sauiour Christ to depart out of their Coasts.
And such like holy people inhabite there still, <HI>viz.</HI> wild <HI>Arabs,</HI>
and <HI>Turks, &amp;c.</HI> We sawe also (neere vnto this Sea) the place
where that Towne (mentioned <HI>Iohn</HI> 2. 1. called <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galile</HI>
stood, where our Sauiour Christ at a mariage turned water
into wine; in place whereof there standeth now a poore village
inhabited by <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>This sea of <HI>Galile</HI> is (by computation) in length 8. leagues,
and in breadth 5. leagues, and euery league is thrée miles; and
then it encloseth it selfe into a narrowe compasse, carrying but
the breadth of an ordinarie riuer vntill it come to <HI>Sodome,</HI>
where it endeth, which is called <HI>mare mortuum,</HI> that is, The
dead Sea.</P>
<P>After we had rode about seuen miles by the sea of <HI>Galile,</HI> we
left it on our left hand, and ascended vp a mountaine on the
right hand.</P>
<P>This mountaine was not very stéepie, but excéeding plea∣sant
and fertile, for (being the springtime) it was so beset with
such varietie of flowers among the greene grasse, that they sée∣med
to flire in our faces, and to <HI>laugh and sing</HI> (as the Psal∣mist
speaketh) as we went. Psal. 65. 13.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="66"/>
This is said to bee that mountaine mentioned <HI>John</HI> 6. 9.
where our Sauiour Christ wrought a miracle in feeding 5000.
men with fiue Barley loaues, and two fishes.</P>
<P>When we came to the top of the mountaine, we saw <HI>Saphet∣ta</HI>
on the right hand, a Vniuersitie of the Iewes where they
speake Hebrew, and haue their Synagogues there. The Ci∣tie
<HI>Saphet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> is situated on a very high hill with thrée tops, and so
the Citie h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th three parts; one part is inhabited by Iewes, the
other two by Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes. We asked some Iewes whom we knew
formerly to haue béene Merchants of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> what they meant
to leaue their trade and to liue there: They answered, they
were now olde and came thither to die, that they might bée
néerer to heauen: wee told them, that howsoeuer they might
seeme there to bee néerer to heauen whiles they lined, because
they dwelt on an high mountaine, yet that they should not bee
néerer vnto heauen when they died, vnlesse they repented and
beléeued in Christ, &amp;c. The Iewes haue here more libertie then
in any part of the holy land. They dare not come to <HI>Ierusalem</HI>
for feare lest the Christians there dwelling, stone them.</P>
<P>Whiles wee were at <HI>Saphetta,</HI> many Turkes departed from
thence towards <HI>Mecha</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI> And the same morning they
went, we saw many women playing with Tymbrels as they
went along the stréete, and made a yelling or scriking noise as
though they cryed. We asked what they meant in so doing?
It was answered vs, that they mourned for the departure of
their husbands, who were gone that morning on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilgrimage
to <HI>Mecha,</HI> and they feared that they should neuer sée them again,
because it was a long way and dangerous, and many died there
euery yéere. It séemed strange to vs, that they should mourne
with musicke about the stréetes, for musicke is vsed in other
places at times of mirth, and not at times of mourning. But
they did it but <HI>Paruae consuetudmis causa.</HI> For a litle customes
sake. And I doubt not but many of them were glad for their
departure, and would be glader if they would neuer come a∣gaine,
they vse them so kindly.</P>
<P>And vnder pretence of deuotion, many trauell to <HI>Mecha</HI> to
buy their <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> commodities: for many of them
<PB N="106" REF="66"/>
see their palpaple ignorance, and in secret speake against it to
those with whom they may be bold, and say, their religion is
naught, yet (being merchants) to auoid pouertie they trauell
thither amongst the rest. So true is that common and com∣mendable
saying:</P>
<Q><L>Impiger, ex tremos, currit mercator ad Indos:</L>
<L>Per mare, pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes.</L></Q>
<P>that is,</P>
<Q><L>The Merchant man though slowe of soote,</L>
<L>To th'Indian shoare doeth runne:</L>
<L>By sea, by land, by fire, by sword,</L>
<L>That pouertie he may shunne.</L></Q>
<P>Yea there was one of their chiefe learned men in <HI>Constanti∣nople,
Anno Dom.</HI> 1604. spake against their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which is
the booke of all their religion, but he lost his head for his labor,
which he willingly and chéerefully yeelded vnto them.</P>
<P>All the way which we trauelled this day, was very pleasant;
and all the ground both hils and dales very fruitfull, according
as it is described by <HI>Moses. Deut.</HI> 8. 7. 8. <HI>and Deut.</HI> 11. 10 <HI>and,</HI> 11.
And we came that day, about two of the clock in the afternoone
to a village called in the <HI>Arabick</HI> tongue <HI>J-nel Tyger,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I-nel Tyger.</NOTE> that is (by
interpretation) <HI>The Marehants eye,</HI> wherein there are two very
faire Castles for trauellers to lodge in from danger of wilde
<HI>Arabs,</HI> which abound in those parts: we tooke vp our lodging in
the néerest castle which is the fairest.</P>
<P>After wee had refreshed our selues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tabor.</NOTE> and slept a while: beeing
hard by mount <HI>Tabor,</HI> we desired to ascend to the top of it, and so
much the rather because I had read that the Papists to prooue
the primacie, or supremacie of <HI>Peter</HI> aboue the rest of the Apo∣stles,
alledge this for one argument, after that Christ was
transfigured vpon mount <HI>Tabor</HI> (as we read <HI>Matth.</HI> 17. 1. 2. <HI>&amp;c.</HI>)
and there appeared to them, <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> talking with him,
<HI>Peter</HI> said to Iesus, Master, <HI>It is good for vs to bee heere, Let vs
make heere three Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and
one for Elias.</HI> Which (say they,) at his request was done, and
remaine there to this day: which to make triall of, wée tooke <HI>Ally</HI>
(one of our Ienesaries,) and rode towards the mountaine. But
<PB REF="67"/>
vnderstanding that it was very dangerous by reason of wilde
<HI>Arabs</HI> which lodged in caues and rockes and bushes about the
mountaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount Tabor</NOTE> we hired some of the principall <HI>Arabs</HI> to goe with vs
and guard vs from the rest. And as we went, we beheld the
prospect of the mountaine to be very pleasant, somewhat stéepy,
but not very high (in respect of some other mountaines there∣about)
nor very large, but a comely round mountaine, beset
with trees and thicke bushes, which at that time of the yéere
flourished greene: we rode so farre as we could for steepinesse
and then left some of our seruants at the foot of the mountaine
to keepe our horses, and tooke vpon vs to clamber vp on foot,
which we should neuer haue been able to haue done, had there
not beene very high grasse, sprigs, and bushes to hold by.</P>
<P>One of our <HI>Arabs</HI> went vp before vs, as fast as if it had been
euen ground, but we came very slowly after, which he percei∣uing,
would looke backe, and often vse these words to chéere vs,
<HI>Gel, Gel, Gel,</HI> that is, <HI>come, come, come:</HI> And sometimes these,
<HI>Ish halac Seeach;</HI> How do you masters. We were almost al out
of breath, and one of our company cried, For the loue of God
let vs returne, for I can goe no further, Oh I shall die, I shall
die. Whereupon one of vs being néerer the top than he himselfe
supposed, (to chéere the rest) said, Come chéerefully; I am on
the top; which somewhat hartued the rest: otherwise they had
all gone downe againe.</P>
<P>Being on the top, we rested a while to take breath; and then
we walked vp and downe the top of the Mount, and saw onely
one house, or rather low cottage, vninhabited, hauing onely
two darke roomes in it, méet for foxes or iackals to lodge in, and
saw no signe of any other tauerne or tabernacle. Only we vn∣derstood
that (many yéeres since) there was a Monasterie there
inhabited by Popish Friers, but being molested by the <HI>Arabs,</HI>
tooke away the holinesse with them, and left the mountaine be∣hind
them; yet still they call this mount <HI>Tabor</HI> in Italian
<HI>Monte Santo,</HI> that is, the holy mountaine: as if there were some
inherent holinesse in the mountaine.</P>
<P>And two daies after we had béene there, came a Iesuite and
two Friers with a yong Gentleman of <HI>Parris</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> who
<PB REF="67"/>
was a Protestant; and some other company with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference betwixt a Ie∣suite and a Protestant.</NOTE> who
had a desire to ascend to the top of this holy mountaine, &amp; went
all together vntill they were wearie which was at the foote of
the mountaine, and in the heat of the day: wherefore the
French Gentleman said, he would stay for them there vntill
they returned, but was himselfe already weary and would goe
no higher; the Iesuite and Friers reproued him, and called him
foole, and told him he did not know what hee might merit by
going to the top of that holy mountaine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merit-mon∣gers.</NOTE> Merit, (said the Gen∣tleman)
what may I merit? Thou maiest merit (said they) 50.
yéeres pardon. The Gentleman, to breake a iest with them,
asked them whether he might merit fiftie yeeres pardon for the
time past, or for the time to come: If (said he) for the time past,
I am not so old (for he was but twenty two yeeres of age) if
for the time to come, hée did not thinke hée should liue so long.
They answered him, if he did not liue so long, he might giue the
yéeres which remained to his friends. Yet could they not per∣swade
him to goe vp any higher.</P>
<P>The same Iesuite called this French Gentleman, Heretike,
because he did not professe himselfe a Romanist: He denied his
argument; and although he was not able to dispute with him
Scholar-like, yet he answered him Christian-like, and told him
that he did abhorre the name of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the nature more:
The Iesuite said, Thou scarce knowest the name, much lesse
the nature of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Gentleman replied, I haue read of
both. And that <HI>Rome</HI> had a name according to her nature, hée
shewed by these verses following:</P>
<Q><L>Roma quid est? Quod te docuit praeposterus ordo.</L>
<L>Quid docuit? Iung as versa elementa, scies.</L>
<L>Roma amor est: Amor est? Qualis? Praeposterus. Vnde hoc?</L>
<L>Roma mares. Noli dicore plara: Scio.</L></Q>
<P>The same in English:</P>
<Q><L>Rome what is? A Loue. A loue? What loue?</L>
<L>Contrary vnto kinde.</L>
<L>How so? Rome loueth men. No more.</L>
<L>Cease speech. I know thy minde.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="113" REF="68"/>
He further told him, that he had béene at <HI>Rome,</HI> and both
séene and heard there the manner of life which he and his fellow
Iesuites lead, and that he was not ignorant how odious they
were euen vnto other Papists, amongst whom one of them
gaue him a Hymne made (by a Papist at <HI>Rome</HI>) against Iesu∣ites,
a copy whereof he gaue vnto me, which I haue thought
good héere to set downe, that the world may see that vnity both

<P>We our selues, when we had séene enough this Mount, re∣turned

<P>March 25. being the Feast of the Annunciation of the Vir∣gin
<HI>Mary,</HI> and (according to the computation of our Church of

places worthy obseruation, but (for want of a good guide) we
knew not the names thereof, for the Turkes inhabiting those
Countries, haue giuen new names to most places. This was
the pleasantest daies iourney we had in our whole trauell. I
neuer saw more fertile ground and pleasant fields, and so much
together, all the whole day from <HI>Mount Tabor</HI> to a village cal∣led
vulgarly <HI>Ienine,</HI> but of old <HI>En-gannim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">En-gannim.</NOTE> whereof we read

thereabout vpon vs: he told vs we were best giue them content
or else we were all but dead men: wherefore to auoid further
danger, we gaue them their owne desire, vpon condition, they
would pursue vs no further, nor suffer any of their company to
molest vs: the chiefest of them answered, <HI>Stopherlo, Stopherlo,</HI>
that is, God forbid, God forbid we should do you any harme,
if you pay vs what wee demaund; which we did with all spéed,
and rode away from them being glad we were rid of them.</P>
<P>About ten miles from them we rode through a wood, (a very
fit place to harbour theeues, who had killed certaine men tra∣uelling
that way the day before, and tooke away both a man and
horse from the <HI>Carauan</HI> which followed after; and a woman al∣so
riding on an asse with their cariage) and (as our guide tolde
vs) he neuer trauelled that way but he sawe some men killed:
and therefore bade vs all charge our pieces and shoot off when
he bade vs, though we saw no bodie, lest the wild <HI>Arabs</HI> should
set vpon vs on the suddain, lying in ambush, which wee also
did in a place most dangerous, to daunte the enemies before we
saw each other. But before we came vnto the most dangerous
<PB N="114" REF="70"/>
place, there ouertooke vs many <HI>Turkes</HI> well armed, who dwelt
in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and were glad of our company thither. And short∣ly
after we had discharged euery man his peece, we saw a great
company of <HI>Arabs</HI> on an high mountaine neere vnto our way,
yet out of the reach of our shot, who perceiuing vs to be too
strong for them, durst not set vpon vs.</P>
<P>And so (by the prouidence of God) we came that night to an
ancient and famous City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Samaria.</NOTE> (situated in a fruitfull valley betwixt
two mountaines) called <HI>Sychar,</HI> a City in <HI>Samaria,</HI> mentioned
<HI>Iohn</HI> 4. Néere whereunto we saw <HI>Iacobs</HI> Well, where our Sa∣uiour
Christ asked water of the woman of <HI>Samaria.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sychar.</NOTE> We came
thither in good time, for we were exceeding thirsty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iacobs Well.</NOTE> and drunke
thereof liberally and freely. The water thereof goeth downe ve∣ry
pleasantly, like vnto milke.</P>
<P>From <HI>Iacobs</HI> Well we went into the City, and lodged in a
very ancient &amp; stately Cane, but very badly kept. It had béene
better for vs to haue slept by <HI>Iacobs</HI> Well, as others did; for here
we slept on the hard stones néere vnto a Chapel in the middle of
the Cane, vnder two or thrée great figge trees and mulberry
trées, where we were scarce safe from theeues; for we had some
things stollen from vs in the night, whiles we slept vnder the
trees on faire broad stones, whereunto we ascended by a faire
stone paire of staires, six or seuen steps from the ground. <HI>Sy∣char</HI>
is distant from <HI>En-gannim</HI> 27. miles.</P>
<P>March 28. We staied at this City in <HI>Samaria,</HI> called of old
<HI>Sychar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Napolis.</NOTE> but at this day commonly, <HI>Napolis;</HI> for the Holy Land
hauing beene often conquered, hath had new names imposed
vnto all the chiefe Cities, and most other townes and villages
also: partly by <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rey</HI> of <HI>Bullome,</HI> who conquered that con∣trey
in the yeere 1098. But chiefly by the Turkes, who con∣quering
the Holy Land and al the Countrie about it, haue chan∣ged
the names of places, to roote out all memoriall of reuenge
in the hearts of posteritie (as they supposed.) Yet the chiefest
Cities are still knowen by their ancient names, though other
names haue béene giuen thereunto. As for example, <HI>Dam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI>
which was so called of old, is still knowen by that name, though

<PB N="115" REF="71"/>
or rather <HI>Kuds,</HI> comming (as I suppose) of the Hebrew word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Kadasch▪</HI> which signifieth to sanctifie or to be holy: or of
<HI>Kadosch,</HI> which signifieth holy. And (as they themselues say)
the word <HI>Cuts</HI> or <HI>Kuds</HI> (whereby they call it) signifieth a holy
City in their language.</P>
<P>The cause of our staying this day at <HI>Sychar,</HI> was this, it was
told vs that 2. <HI>Emeers</HI> or great Lords in our way to <HI>Ierusalem</HI>
were vp in armes one against an other, and therefore it séemed
good to our <HI>Ienesary</HI> that wee should stay for the <HI>Carauan,</HI> that
we might be the stronger and passe safer. But when the <HI>Carauan</HI>
came, they pitched their tents by <HI>Iacobs</HI> well, and purposed to
stay there two or three daies at the least. Wee were loath to
stay so long being now but thirtie miles from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and
therefore resolued to procéed in our iourney without any lon∣ger
expectation for companie which was vncertaine.</P>
<P><HI>March.</HI> 29. We departed from <HI>Samaria</HI> to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and met
many souldiers in seuerall companies by the way, who know∣ing
our <HI>Ienesary</HI> and other Turks in our company, let vs passe
by them quietly, and gaue vs the <HI>salam alick,</HI> that is <HI>peace be vn∣to
you.</HI></P>
<P>The first part of this daies iourney was somewhat pleasant;
but, the néerer we came to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the more barren and te∣dious
our way was. About ten of the clock wee came to a great
forrest or wildernes full of trées and mountaines. When wée
were on the top of this mountaine, wée saw the maine sea on
our right hand, and small Ships sayling towards <HI>Ioppa.</HI></P>
<P>About thrée or foure of the clocke, we came to a ruinous vil∣lage
called <HI>Beere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beere,</NOTE> but of old (as it is reported) <HI>Beersheba,</HI> which
in former times was a great Citie: And it is said to be the place
where <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> comming from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> (the feast be∣ing
ended) missed the child <HI>Iesus,</HI> and sought him sorrowing; and
returning to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> found him in the Temple amidst the
Doctors, hearing them and posing them. Our purpose was to
lodge here all night, being all of vs weary and hungry, and all
our prouision spent. But finding nothing here to bee had for
money either for man or horse; and vnderstanding that <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI>
was but ten miles off, we went on in our way somewhat
<PB REF="71"/>
faintly fiue or sixe miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierusalem.</NOTE> and then beholding the prospect of the
Citie, wee were somewhat cheered and reuiued, and solaced our
selues with singing of Psalmes, vntill we came neere vnto the
Citie.</P>
<P>Many Gréekes dwelling in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> seeing vs a farre off,
came to meet vs, supposing their Patriarch had been in our
companie, who came two or thrée daies after vs.</P>
<P>Wee dismounted from our horses at the west gate of the Ci∣tie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioppa gate.</NOTE>
called <HI>Ioppa</HI> gate, or the Castle gate; which is a very strong
gate of iron, with thirteen pieces of brasse ordinance planted on
the wall about the gate. Wee staied in the porch of this gate,
and might not be admitted into the Citie, vntill we were sear∣ched
by an officer (as the maner is.) In the meane time there
came to vs two Italian Friers, <HI>viz. Padre Angelo,</HI> and <HI>Padre
Aurel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o</HI> and kissed our hands, and bade vs welcome, and told vs
that two other Englishmen were at their house, <HI>viz.</HI> master
<HI>Timberley,</HI> and master <HI>Borell.</HI></P>
<P>When we were searched without the gate by a Turkish offi∣cer,
and deliuered vp our weapons to the porter to kéepe for vs
in the gate-house vntill our returne (because no Christian may
enter into <HI>Ierusalem</HI> with weapons) these two <HI>Padres</HI> led vs
to their Monasterie; at the gate whereof wee were searched a∣gaine
by another Turkish officer before wee might enter into
the house. For the office of the former searcher at the gate of
the Citie was onely to receiue the weapons of all Christians,
and deliuer them safe to them againe at their departure. But
this searcher went further and searched all our cariage which he
caused to be opened, to see whether we had any gun-powder or
any other engins there. For they are very suspicious of all
Christians, fearing, lest for deuotion to the place, they should
worke treason; therefore they suffer not Christians to enter in∣to
the City weaponed, lest they make insurrection against them
when they are many together, and conquer the Citie, as hereto∣fore
they haue done,</P>
<P>To this end also is the Citie walled about with strong wals,
and fortified with foure strong gates and a Castle, (built by
<HI>Sultan Soliman</HI>) and euery gate well planted with ordinance for
<PB N="117" REF="72"/>
feare of Christians. And partly for hope haue they enuironed
this City with such strong wals, that Christians for deuotion to
the place, might come and build within the wals and be subiect to
the Turke. For though their walles bee large and strong, yet
there is great roome within the wals to build more houses then
are there, for there are fields of Corne within the walles of the
Citie; and the houses stand very thin, scattered, and dispersed,
héere one and there two or three together; there is not one
faire stréet in all <HI>Ierusalem</HI> as it now is.</P>
<P>After they had thus narrowly searched al our cariage, euen to
our Cases of Bottles, we were admitted into the Monastery; at
the entrance whereinto, met vs master <HI>Timberley</HI> and master
<HI>Boreel,</HI> and then <HI>Signior Franciscus Mannerba</HI> the <HI>Padre Guar∣dian</HI>
of the monastery, and all the rest in order, and bade vs wel∣come,
and led vs into a faire parler and set good chéere before vs,
and serued vs themselues.</P>
<P>After supper wee deliuered them our letters which wee had
brought from the <HI>Venice</HI> Consull of <HI>Aleppo</HI> and other <HI>Italian</HI>
Merchants there in our behalfe. Which when they had read,
the Guardian said, our custome is, when stangers come to vs,
to call them the first night to Masse, and to Confession, and to
giue euery man a candle to hold in his hand at Masse time; and
at night to wash their feete and to bring them to bed, and to ma∣nie
other ceremonies during the whole time of their continu∣ance
there.</P>
<P>But as for vs, they vnderstood by letters what we were; and
told vs that wee were so highly commended by their Patrones
and Benefactors, the <HI>Venice</HI> Consul, and Merchants of <HI>Aleppo,</HI>
that if they should shew vs halfe the fauour which was required
at their hands, they should themselues lie without doores, and
suffer vs to rule and <HI>dominier</HI> at our pleasures. And that ther∣fore
they would not vrge vs to any thing against our conscien∣ces,
but giue frée libertie both of persons and consciences as if
we were in <HI>England,</HI> or in our own houses elsewhere: &amp; so much
the rather because they vnderstood our Merchants were rich, and
hoped to gaine by vs. In regard wherof, although it were Lent,
wherein they eate no flesh, yet offered vs Hens, Egs, Milke:
<PB N="118" REF="72"/>
any thing that was there to bee had for money, they requested
vs to command it.</P>
<P>And during the time of our continuance there, he commaun∣ded
one <HI>Padre Aurelio</HI> to attend vpon vs, and sée that we wan∣ted
nothing; and another of his brethren, one <HI>Padre Angelo,</HI> to
be our guide abroad and to shew vs al ancient Monuments and
places worth séeing either in the Citie or out of the Citie.</P>
<P>These kind speeches being vsed, they brought vs to our cham∣bers
where we should lodge all night, &amp; prouided for uery man
seuerally a good neate bed with faire shéetes and all things very
holesome and handsome, where we slept swéetly, and refreshed
our wearied bodies all that night very comfortably.</P>
<P>But although they dealt thus kindly with vs (at the instance
of their benefactors) in giuing vs liberty of conscience, yet they
deale not so with others. For some I doe know who haue béen
there, and made no conscience to doe as they haue done, accor∣ding
to those verses:</P>
<Q><L>Cùm fueris Romae, Romano vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ito more:</L>
<L>Cùm fueris alibi, viuito more loci.</L></Q>
<P>That is,</P>
<Q><L>When they are at Rome, they doe what there is done:</L>
<L>When they are elswhere, they doe as they doe there.</L></Q>
<P>But they should rather remember that which <HI>Baptista Man∣tuanus</HI>
(an <HI>Italian</HI>) writeth of <HI>Rome:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Viuere qui sanctè cupitis, discedite: Romae</L>
<L>Omnia quum liceant, non licet esse pium.</L></Q>
<P>The same in English:</P>
<Q><L>Wouldst thou liue well? depart from Rome:</L>
<L>All things there lawfull be,</L>
<L>Except to be a godly man,</L>
<L>Which thing is rare to see.</L></Q>
<P>The same <HI>Baptista Mantuanus</HI> writeth of them thus:</P>
<Q><L>Venalia nobis</L>
<L>Templa, Sacerdotes, Altaria, Sacra, Coronae,</L>
<L>Ignes, Thura, Praeces, Coelum est venale, Deusque</L></Q>
<P>The same in English;</P>
<Q><L>Rome felleth Temples, Priests, and Altars,</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="73"/>
Fires, Frankincense, and Praiers.</L>
<L>Yea Heauen, and God himselfe, for gold,</L>
<L>At Rome is to be bought and sold.</L></Q>
<P>Wherefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An admoni∣tion to such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trauell to Ierusalem.</NOTE> I admonish those who haue a desire to trauell
to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> héereafter, to take héed to themselues, that they
make not shipwracke of conscience; for if they come not well
commended, or well monied, or both, there is no being for them,
except they partake with them in their idolatrous seruices.</P>
<P>True it is, that the <HI>Turkes</HI> giue liberty of conscience vnto
all that come thither; but they giue not entertainment vnto any
Christians in their houses. And the Gréeke Patriarkes are
poore, and not able to protect such as come vnto them for re∣fuge.
These <HI>Padres,</HI> though they be Papists, yet haue they rich
benefactors, and want nothing, and (for the most part) very
kinde and curteous to strangers in all things, liberty of consci∣ence
only excepted, wherein they séeke to make other like vnto
themselues, and to seduce them from their faith, and to winne
them to the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> and offer vnto them who haue
money in their purses, to make them Knights of the Sepulcher;
but no good English Subiect will accept of that order of Knight∣hood;
for at the receiuing thereof, they sweare to be true to the
Pope, and to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and to other things, which no
man can doe with a good conscience.</P>
<P>And this kindnesse and liberty of conscience, which we found
amongst them, we imputed not so much to the men, as to our
owne money; for it cost vs <HI>charo, viz.</HI> 100. duccats for our en∣tertainment:
for we knew them to be of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and were not ignorant that,</P>
<Q><L>Curia Romana non captat ouem sine lana.</L></Q>
<P>that is,</P>
<Q><L>The Court of <HI>Rome</HI> no sheepe doth receiue,</L>
<L>Vnlesse to them her fleece she leaue.</L></Q>
<P>And as one <HI>Iohn</HI> a Monke wrote of them,</P>
<Q><L>Curia vult mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as, bursas exhaurit &amp; arcas;</L>
<L>Si bursae parcas, fuge Papas &amp; Patriarchas.</L>

<L>Fers aliquid? non. Sta foris. Fero quo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> satis, Intra.</L></Q>
<P>The same in English:</P>
<Q><L>The Court of Rome doth aime at markes;</L>
<L>It sucks the purse, and soakes the arkes.</L>
<L>If that you minde to spare your arkes,</L>
<L>Come not at Popes nor Patriarkes.</L>
<L>But if you frankly giue them markes,</L>
<L>And with good gold stuffe vp their Arkes,</L>
<L>I warrant then you shall be free</L>
<L>From any kind of penaltie.</L>
<L>Who's within? Whose there? I per se I.</L>
<L>Why, what would ye? Come in.</L>
<L>Bring you ought? No. Stand still.</L>
<L>But I doe. Goe ye then in.</L></Q>
<P>The same <HI>Monke</HI> writeth, that <HI>Rome</HI> being founded by
théeues, retaineth still somewhat of her old qualities. For (saith
he) she is called <HI>Roma, quod rodat manum,</HI> of greasing the hand:</P>
<Q><L>Roma manus rodit; Quod rodere non valet, odit.</L>
<L>Dantes exaudit, non dantibus ostia claudit.</L>
<L>Curia curarum genetrix, nutrixque malorum.</L>
<L>Ignotos notis, inhonestis in aequat honestos.</L></Q>
<P>The same in English:</P>
<Q><L>Rome is a raker, and spightfull hater of the empty hand:</L>
<L>She heareth the giuer, but others neuer, but letteth them stand.</L>
<L>Her Court a cage of cares; of mischiefes eke the mother;</L>
<L>She vseth knaues like honest men, and strangers like a brother.</L></Q>
<P>Wel, though we were fléeced amongst them, yet had we libertie
of conscience; and safety of persons, and had no way any wrong
offered vs by them, either in word or déed; but by two or thrée
<HI>Iesuiticall Iebusites</HI> (who were strangers there as well as wée)
some vnkindnesse was offered vs behinde our backs (for they
durst not any way deale with vs to our faces) in railing vpon
vs and our Religion, as it was told vs at our departure by one
who heard them: Especially by a Iesuite named (but vndeser∣uedly)
<HI>Benedictus,</HI> and yet he could neither <HI>benedicere</HI> nor <HI>be∣nefacere,</HI>
neither say well nor doe well, by any that were not of
<PB N="121" REF="74"/>
their sect and sort: And therefore deserued not to be called <HI>Be∣nedictus,</HI>
(but <HI>per Antiphrafin.</HI>) but rather <HI>Maledictus, à maledi∣cendo,</HI>
as one of our company wrote vnto him in this manner,
in méeter, although barbarously: truly, although not poetically:</P>
<Q><L>Audi, tace, lege, benedic▪ benefac, Benedicte:</L>
<L>Aut haec peruerte, maledic, malefac, Maledicte.</L></Q>
<P>The same in English:</P>
<Q><L>O Benedict, heare, hold thy peace,</L>
<L>Doe well, say well (O Scorner)</L>
<L>Else let thy name be Meledict,</L>
<L>Peruerting all the former.</L></Q>
<P>After we had rested one night in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the first day wée
walked about the City our selues without our guide, onely to
view the City, not inquiring of any place what it was, because
on the morrow after, and euery day during our continuance,
(which was about fourtéene daies) our guide either walked on
foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolution of a doubt con∣cerning Pe∣ters warming himselfe in the high Priests hall.</NOTE> or rode with vs, to sée all things worthy obseruation. Only
one thing I obserued and duly considered the first day I came,
which was this; that where as we read in the Gospell, that
when our Sauiour Christ was betraied, and brought into the
High Priests Hall, <HI>Peter</HI> following him, stood by the fire, and
warmed himselfe; the reason is there yéelded, because it was
cold. And the memoriall néereof we obserue in March or Aprill.
We being there at the same season of the yéere, found it excée∣ding
hot, &amp; hotter than it is vsually at midsommer in England:
It seemed strange vnto me, how it should then be so cold, that
<HI>Peter</HI> should créepe to the fire, and now (at the same season) so
hot that we could not endure the heat of the Sunne. And on
the sudden I knew not whether the season were altered, or the
passion of Christ might be referred to some colder season of the
yéere. But after I had béene there a few daies, the very place
resolued that doubt: For there fall great dewes, and before the
Sunne haue dried it vp, it is cold, and in the night season (a∣bout
that time of the yéere) somewhat cold, as I felt by experi∣ence
when I slept in the fields all night. And <HI>Peter</HI> hauing
watched with Christ in the night, might well be cold in the
morning, before the heat of the Sunne had expelled cold.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="74"/>
And yet another reason (in my iudgement) more effectuall
than the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Reason.</NOTE> may be yéelded for this matter, taken <HI>à simili,</HI>
that as the same night that Christ was borne, there was great
light at midnight, in token of comfort; And at the time of his
death, great darknesse at noone day, in token of sorrow (for
the Sunne put on his mourning garment, and was asha∣med
to looke vpon that cruelty which the sonnes of men were
not afraid to commit) So at the time of his betraying there
might be extraordinary cold wether, in that an extraordinarie
person suffered, and an extraordinary worke was in hand. And
extraordinary things happened about the time of his passion, as
we read in the Gospell, <HI>viz.</HI> How the graues did open: The dead
bodies of Saints (which slept) arose: The veile of the Temple
did rent in twaine from the top of the bottome: The earth did
tremble, and the stones did cleaue asunder. These things decla∣red
that a notable person suffered. The like alteration might
be in the coldnesse of the aire, and alteration of wether. And al∣though
we read it not in expresse words, yet (since I haue
séene <HI>Ierusalem</HI>) it séemeth to me, that it may be gathered from
that place of the Gospell, where it is said, <HI>Simon Peter</HI> warmed
himselfe.</P>
<P>For (if we truly calculate the time) the season of the yéere
was hot ordinarily; and <HI>Simon Peter</HI> at that season of the yéere
was so cold, that he was driuen to the fire, and therefore it
should séeme to be vnseasonable wether, and extraordinarily
cold. These considerations haue satisfied my selfe (howeuer
they satisfie others) vntill I heare or read some more sufficient
reason.</P>
<P><HI>Ierusalem</HI> is in <HI>Palestina.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquitie of Ierusalem.</NOTE> It was the goodliest City that euer

<HEAD>A particular declaration of such thing as

<HEAD>Apparant Truths.</HEAD>
<P>And first of al it séemeth to me a manifest truth, that <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI>
(that now it) standeth in the same place where the old
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> did: not in euery respect for length b bredth, but with
some difference: for whereas we read in the Gospell, that they
crucified our Sauiour Christ at <HI>Golgotha▪</HI> without the Citie,
néere whereunto there was a new Sepulcher wherein neuer
man lay, and therein they laid his blessed body. Now both
Mount <HI>Caluari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> where <HI>Golgotha</HI> (that is, <HI>The place of dead
mens skuls</HI> was) and the Sepulcher (at least wise the place
where the Sepulcher was) are all enclosed within the wals of
<PB N="124" REF="75"/>
the City, which were built by <HI>Sultan Solyman,</HI> or <HI>Sultan Selim.</HI>
So that, although some difference there be; yet it is not so great
but that a man may boldly affirme, that part of this City is
now in the same place where the old <HI>Ierusalem stood;</HI> and a part
thereof somewhat remooued.</P>
<P>Yet some (who haue neuer béene there) haue presumed to af∣firme,
that no man knoweth the place where old <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
stood, and that no signe of the City is to be séene. But that the
place is still the same, it is manifest by the situation thereof,
which is described in the Scripture to haue beene néere vnto
these mountaines, <HI>Moriah, Syon, Caluarie, Mount Oliuet, Be¦than<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI>
and <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age;</HI> and not far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from <HI>Bethl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem:</HI> which
Mountaines and places are there still to be séene, and called
still by the same names.</P>
<P>And whereas they say no signe of the City is to bée séene,
grounding their assertion upon a place of Scripture falsly appli∣ed,
and say that Christ promised to destroy <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and not
to leaue one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vpon another that should not be ouerthrow∣en:
If they read the place <HI>Luke</HI> 21. 6. they shall finde that
spoken of the Temple which they apply vnto the City. And I
doe verily pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swade nay selfe, that euen in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that now
is, there are stones vpon stones yet leaft, which we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e neuer o∣uerthrowen
since the first building of the City: for on the foun∣dation
of the wals in many places (especially towards Mount
<HI>Oliue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) there are yet stones to be seene, which both for quantity
and quality may be thought to haue beene there euer since the
beginning: for they are of huge length and bredth, and of a
blacke colour; like whereunto I neuer saw any in any other
place of all my trauels. And ouer these old stones, the vpper
part of the wals are a new building, differing both in colour and
quantity from the foundation stones.</P>
<P>But of the Temple it is true which our sauiour Christ spake
<HI>Luk.</HI> 21. 6. For when as the Prophets denounced Gods iudge∣ments
vnto the <HI>Iewes,</HI> vnlesse they repented, they flattered
themselues in their sinnes, and cried, <HI>Templum Domini, Tem∣plum
Domini, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of thy Lord.</HI>
But through their prophanation, they made the Temple of the
<PB N="125" REF="76"/>
Lord a Denne of Théeues. They cried, <HI>Lord, Lord,</HI> but they
did not his will on whom they cried. For swéet grapes, they
yeelded sowre; for hearty and sincere seruice, hypocriticall and
painted shewes of Religion. Their glory was in the externall
beauty of their materiall Temple: They wondred at the stones
and goodly buildings, at the gorgeous furniture and pretious
gifts, wherewith it was both outwardly and inwardly ador∣ned
and enriched. Whereupon our Sauiour (to take away the
cause of this vaine hope, and foolish ioy) tooke occasion thus to
Prophecie of that glorious Temple: <HI>Are these the things that
you looke vpon? The daies will come wherein there shall not be
left a stone vpon a stone, which shall not bee destroied.</HI> This
Prophecie was as euidently accomplished as it was made: for
thirty eight yéeres after they had crucified Christ, their promi∣sed
<HI>Messias,</HI> the Lord of glory; God raised vp the seruants of his
wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <HI>Vespatian</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> Emperours of <HI>Rome,</HI> who besee∣ged,
conquered, and razed their <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> made hauocke of the
people as of dogges, murdered eleuen hundred thousand, man,
woman, and childe, of that cursed Nation. Then was fulfilled
they cry of those crucifiers, <HI>His blood be vpon our heads, and vp∣on
our children.</HI> It hath béene, and shall be for euer.</P>
<P>Yea the violence of the <HI>Romans</HI> procéeded further, and pulled
downe the Temple, and laid it flat with the ground, insomuch
that (according to the expresse words of our Sauiours Prophe∣cie)
they left not one stone vpon another. The <HI>Iewes</HI> sundry
times, hauing obtained leaue of <HI>Iulian</HI> the <HI>Apostata,</HI> attempted
to build it vp againe, but it would not be; for what their hand
builded in the day, the hand of the Lord (most miraculously)
hurled downe, and burnt with lightning by night, the founda∣tion
thereof being shaken with earth-quakes. And at this pre∣sent
day there is built in the place thereof a Muskia or Turkish
Church, whereunto no Christian may haue accesse. It is not
in the forme of <HI>Salomons</HI> Temple, but after the manner of their
Turkish buildings: Not for the seruice of the true God, but of
the false Prophet <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Vnto the truth also of sundry other particulars (which they<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>
shewed vs) doe I subscribe. And first of all, that at <HI>Beth-lehem,</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="76"/>
sixe miles from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> is the very place where our Saui∣our
Christ was borne: although now (<HI>honoris gratia</HI>) they haue
made it more beautifull, being built of marble, at the cost of
Queene <HI>Helena</HI> the mother of <HI>Constantine,</HI> (whome some report
to haue béene an English woman, borne at <HI>Colechester</HI>) who
hath there also erected a stately Church, which to this day is ve∣ry
well kept. They told vs also that <HI>S. Hierome</HI> dwelt there,
which cannot be denied.</P>
<P>From <HI>Beth-lehem</HI> we rode seuen miles further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ziph.</NOTE> to the desart
of <HI>Ziph</HI> or wildernesse of <HI>Iudah,</HI> where <HI>Dauid</HI> hid himselfe when
he was persecuted be <HI>Saul.</HI> We went also to the hill Countrie of
<HI>Iudea,</HI> where the virgine <HI>Mary</HI> saluted <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the wife of
<HI>Zacharias,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudea.</NOTE> mother of <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> being great with child, and
at her salutation the babe sprung in her belly.</P>
<P>From thence wee rode further to the wildernesse of <HI>Iudaea,</HI>
where <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> preached; and in the middle of the de∣scending
of a mountaine, they shewed vs a chamber hewen out
of a liuely rocke foure square, with a dore and a window, and a
place for his bed and table, by which place there issueth a fine
spring of water out of the rocke, at which place we dranke of the
water.</P>
<P>From thence returning to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> they shewed vs (in the
way to <HI>Gaza</HI>) the water where <HI>Philip</HI> Baptized the <HI>Eunuch,
Act.</HI> 8. 38.</P>
<P>At our returne to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> they brought vs to mount Oli∣uet,
from whence our Sauiour Christ ascended into Heauen,
being from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> a Sabboth daies iourney, not two miles.</P>
<P>From the mount of Oliues, we went to <HI>Bethania</HI> and <HI>Beth∣phage,</HI>
which are now ruinous villages. There are many figge
trées still growing about these two villages, and many Oliue
trées about the mount of Oliues: wee cut off some of the bran∣ches
and carried some sprigs with vs.</P>
<P>Néerer <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> they shewed vs mount <HI>Sion</HI> and the mount
<HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h,</HI> on which <HI>Abraham</HI> offered his sonne <HI>Isaac;</HI> we saw also
the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> and the valley of <HI>Iehinnom</HI> and the
brooke <HI>Cedron</HI> which is now in the Sommer time a drie chan∣nell.
Some part of the tower of <HI>Sylo</HI> and the poole <HI>Syloam,</HI> and
<PB N="127" REF="77"/>
the potters field bought with the thirtie pieces of siluer which
<HI>Iudas</HI> had for betraying his master Christ; called <HI>Acheldama:</HI>
which to this day is a place to bury strangers in.</P>
<P>Ascending vp <HI>Acheldama,</HI> we entred into a porch, and looked
downe into a vault, where wee saw many dead bodies; couered
onely with their winding sheet knit at the head and foot, with∣out
any coffin: and some of their shéets were so white, that they
séemed to vs to haue beene buried but few daies before we came.</P>
<P>The valley betwixt <HI>Acheldama</HI> and mount <HI>Syon,</HI> is called
the vale of <HI>Iehinnom.</HI></P>
<P>The valley of <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> is thrée miles in length, reaching
from the vale of <HI>Ieh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nom</HI> to a place without the Citie; which
they call the Sepulcher of the Kings.</P>
<P>Lastly, they brought vs to mount <HI>Caluarie,</HI> to the place where
Christ was crucified, ouer which there is now erected a stately
building with many Iles, Chancels, or little Chapels, in it for
sundry Nations, which were al there at that present time as we
were, and lodged there on Saterday at night before Palme
Sunday.</P>
<P>We entred into this Temple to sée the Sepulcher on Satur∣day
after dinner, and came not foorth vntill Monday about ele∣uen
of the clocke, for there are lodgings adioining vnto it, into
which we entred through the highest Chancell or Chappell.</P>
<P>Before wee were admitted hereunto, euery man paied nine
Shekines to see the Sepulcher, which money the <HI>Syniacke:</HI>
or chiefe Ruler of the citie hath, who is a Turke. Into the Sepul∣cher
we went but one at a time with our guide; the entrance
thereinto is lowe and narrow. The place it selfe is but the
length of an ordinary Sepulcher, it is now as high as an Altar
or table, of faire marble stone, and there are lampes continually
burning night and day.</P>
<P>That this Sepulcher standeth in the same place as the Sepul∣cher
did wherein the bodie of our Sauiour Christ was laid, wée
made no doubt, because it was agréeable to the circumstances of
Scripture whereby the place is described.</P>
<P>But I asked our guide whether any part of the selfesame se∣pulcher
wherein the blessed bodie of our Sauiour was laid,
<PB N="128" REF="77"/>
were to be séene there? Hee answered me, that some part of it
was at <HI>Rome,</HI> and some other part of it lay inclosed vnder that
Altar; but not to be seene.</P>
<P>And further he told me, that at the first, after the resurrecti∣on
of our Sauiour Christ, all the whole Sepulcher was to bee
seene for many yeeres space, vntill strangers (who came to vi∣site
it) began to breake off péeces and to cary them away: then
it was inclosed with barres, and to be séene through the barres,
but not to bée touched, as some Sepulchers in Saint <HI>Pauls</HI>
Church in <HI>London</HI> are.</P>
<P>Yet they saw inconueniences héerein, in that many vsed to
cast into it the first haire of their children, and some candles, and
other things as an offering thereunto; so that the place could
not be kéep neate. Wherefore Quéene <HI>Helena</HI> caused it to bée
inclosed in such sort as it now is, and couered it with Marble.</P>
<P>But whether any part of the selfe same Sepulcher were vn∣derneath
the same or not; it gaue me content that I had seene
the selfe same place where the Sepulcher of our blessed Sauiour
was; as I in heart did then, and do still perswade my selfe it is.</P>
<P>Many superstitious Papists exept on their knees to the Se∣pulcher,
mumbling vp their praiers vpon heads as they went,
according to the definition of Poperie, which is rightly defined
by <HI>Baptista Mantuanus,</HI> to be a Religion:
<Q><L>Quae filo insertis numerat sua murmura baccis.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Poperie is a religion which vseth to patter,</L>
<L>Aue Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vpon beads, and the Pater noster.</L></Q></P>
<P>Not far from thence is the Sepulcher of <HI>Godfroy</HI> of <HI>Bul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and King <HI>Baldewyn,</HI> who conquered that countrey in the yéere
1098. And both of them lie there buried, with the whole
proportion of their bodies in stone, with these <HI>Epitaphs</HI> about
them.</P>
<P>An <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nscription written about the Sepulcher

<P>This <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloine</HI> was the first proclaimed Christi∣an
King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> who refused to be crowned there, saying,
that it was vnfit that the seruants head should there be crow∣ned
with gold, where the Masters head had béene crowned
with thornes.</P>
<P><HI>Ierusalem</HI> is gouerned by <HI>Turkes,</HI> but inhabited by Christi¦ans
of sundry Nations, whereof some come onely to visit and
superstitiously to worship there, and so returne into their coun∣tries.
Others come thither to dwell, and exercise their manu∣all
arts, with a purpose there to die, thinking that they shall
sooner goe to heauen if they die there, than in any other place.</P>
<P>There were at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> (when we were there) Christians
of sundry Nations, especially <HI>Armenians,</HI> whereof some are
called <HI>Georgians,</HI> and some <HI>Iacobites.</HI> Their Patriarke was
not there, but least sicke, at <HI>Aleppo;</HI> but in his place he sent an

<HI>Nazaritans, Cofties,</HI> and <HI>Abassens</HI> or Aethiopians of <HI>Prestar Iohns</HI>

which is a place in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> where the fall of the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI>

that dwell néere it: Besides many <HI>Italians, Frenchmen, Dutch∣men,</HI>
and vs fiue Englishmen.</P>
<P>Many <HI>Turkes</HI> also visited the Sepulcher of Christ; for they
both thinke and speake very reuerently of Christ. And though
they doe not beleeue to be saued by Christ, yet they say hée was
a great Prophet, but that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was greater. And vsual∣ly
when they haue ended their Ceremonies at <HI>Meccha,</HI> at their
returne they visit the Sepulcher of Christ at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> For
they haue an opinion, that vnlesse they visit the Sepulcher of
Christ, and the Holy Land, as well as the Sepulcher of Maho∣met,
their pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha</HI> were to no purpose, nor accep∣table
to God.</P>
<P>But I saw not one <HI>Iew</HI> in all <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> for they are so hate∣full

<HEAD>Manifest vntruths.</HEAD>
<P>BEsides these and many other matters which we there saw
and heard, which I account manifest truths, because there
is Scripture or reason for them, or both; they shewed and told
vnto vs, and especially vnto others who would beléeue them,
many things which were false and ridiculous, whereof (to a∣uoid
tediousnesse) I will name onely some few, referring the
rest to next Letters, or to our good méeting, which it may
please God in good time to grant vs.</P>
<P>At <HI>Beth-lehem</HI> they brought vs into the place which at Christs
birth was a Stable for Oxen and Asses, but now a beautifull
place built of stone, and adorned with a manger of marble, and
a crach ouer it, with an Oxe and an Asse of marble stone, and
the blessed babe in the midst, and the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> sitting by.</P>
<P>And looking vp to the roofe of the house, they shewed vs a hole
made of purpose in the very top of the house, and told vs, that
thorow that hole the Starre fell downe, which directed the three
<PB N="131" REF="79"/>
Kings of <HI>Collen</HI> of Christ: Wherein they deliuered thrée Vn∣truths.</P>
<P>1 In saying that the starre fell downe into the roome, where∣as
the Scripture saith, not that it fell downe, but stood ouer the
place where the babe was, <HI>Matth.</HI> 2. 9.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, they erre in saying that they were thrée Kings of
<HI>Colyn</HI> or <HI>Colonia Agrippina</HI> (as it is called) whereas the Text
saith, <HI>There came wise men from the East to Jerusalem. Colo∣nia</HI>
is not East from <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>3. Thirdly, they erre in setting downe the number of them to
be thrée, because they brought thrée gifts, which is not so to be
taken, but only that they which came, presented vnto him the
chiefest commodities of their Country.</P>
<P>Yet at <HI>Colonia</HI> they perswade themselues to this day, that
thrée Kings went from thence to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the time of
Christs birth, to worship him. For I hauing occasion to trauell
thorow <HI>Germany,</HI> staied at <HI>Colonia Agrippina</HI> one day, and
went into the chiefe Church of the City, where I saw these ver∣ses
written on the wall:</P>
<Q><L>Tres Reges Regi Regum tria dona ferebant,</L>

<P>I had conference there with some, who would bee counted
learned, and they vnderstood that place, of three Kings who
went from their Citie <HI>Colonia</HI> to <HI>Beth-lehem,</HI> to worship Christ
at the time of his birth, and very obstinately and absurdly de∣fended
it.</P>
<P>In the way betwixt <HI>Jerusalem</HI> &amp; <HI>Beth-lehem,</HI> they take vpon
them to shew the place (to ignorant trauellers) where the Angel
tooke vp <HI>Abackuck</HI> the Prophet by the haire of the head, to carie
meat to <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Lions den: but they might doe well first
to prooue that there was such a thing done, before they demon∣strate
the place where it was done.</P>
<P>Another matters of like sort they demonstrate in the way be∣twixt
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> &amp; <HI>Beth-lehem,</HI> which is the Terebinth or Tur∣pentine
trée, vnder which the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> sate when shee gaue
her child sucke, trauelling on foote betwixt those two Cities.</P>
<P>And yet another in the same way as absurd as the rest, which
is this. In the high way or lane betwixt <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and <HI>Beth-lehem,</HI>
they shew a great broad stone immoueable, and euenwith
the ground, (being a naturall rocke) where the Prophet <HI>Elias</HI> in
his trauels was wont to sléepe: and shame not to say that hee
slept so often vpon that stone, that the very impression of his bo∣die
remaineth in that stone to be séene to this day.</P>
<P>Truth it is indéed that there are in a stone that way, some
hollow places, but no formall proportion of a man; and who is
so simple to thinke that it may not rather come by the often fal∣ling
of the raine vpon it, then by often sléeping on it? according
to that verse,</P>
<Q><L>Gutta cauat lapidem, non vi, sed saepe cadendo.</L></Q>
<P>that is,</P>
<Q><L>The drops of raine make hollow the stone,</L>
<L>By often falling thereupon.</L></Q>
<P>Yea, they not onely told vs these false and friuolous matters,
but also reade vnto vs as vaine and fabulous matters as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.

For whiles we were at table at dinner in <HI>Beth-lehem</HI> in com∣panie
with many Friers, one of them read a Chapter out of their
golden <HI>Legend</HI> in Latine, vntill the Guardian of <HI>Beth-lehem</HI>
(perceiuing that wee gaue no eare thereunto, but confounded
the parts of their meale) inioyned him silence.</P>
<P>For it is their custome to deuide their meales into thrée parts.</P>
<P>The first is <HI>Altum silentium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A method in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> that is, <HI>Deepe silence;</HI> which is
not onely whiles they are saying grace, but whiles one of them
readeth a Chapter out of their <HI>Legend</HI> of Lies, which they call
<HI>Legendarium aureum,</HI> the golden <HI>Legende;</HI> and say, that it ex∣celleth
all other bookes, (yea the Bible it selfe) as farre as gold
excelleth other mettals. But why that booke should be called a
golden <HI>Legende</HI> (saith <HI>Viues</HI>) I doe not know, sith it was writ∣ten
by a man of an iron mouth and a leaden heart.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Stridor dentium,</HI> that is, Chapping and Chew∣ing;
grinding and grating their meat with their teeth.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>Rumor gentium,</HI> that is, Chatting and Prating,
talking and telling of newes.</P>
<P>But wee being wearie of walking foure miles on foote from
<HI>Beth-lehem</HI> to <HI>Solomons</HI> Fish-ponds, and the fountaine inclo∣sed
vnder the earth: at our returne to <HI>Beth-lehem</HI> wee were
wearie and hungry, and were no sooner set at table, but after
some short <HI>Silentium,</HI> we fell to <HI>Stridor dentium.</HI> And whiles the
rest of the Friers were at their <HI>Altum silentium,</HI> giuing eare to
the fables read out of their <HI>Legende;</HI> we were at the third part
of our meale, <HI>viz. Rumor gentium;</HI> talking both of forraine and

<P>At <HI>Ierusalem</HI> on mount <HI>Caluarie</HI> in the house erected ouer the
Sepulcher, they shew vnto strangers a marble piller where∣unto,
they say, our Sauiour was bound when hee was whipt
for our sakes: but who is so simple to thinke that there was any
marble piller erected without the Citie for such a purpose to pu∣nish
offendors (as they accounted our Sauiour Christ) at that
day?</P>
<P>Or who knoweth the particular place where he was impriso∣ned
at this day? Yet, say they, this is the place where Christ
was imprisoned whiles they were making his Crosse.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="80"/>
And this is the place where (the Crosse being laid a long) our
Sauiour was fastened or nailed vnto it.</P>
<P>And this is the place where the Crosse stoode: and haue made
there two holes in signe of it, as though the nether parte of his
Crosse consisted of two parts or pillers.</P>
<P>And néere vnto the tower of <HI>Sylo</HI> they shew a water comming
from vnder a rocke, which they call the poole <HI>Syloam:</HI> and there
(say they) did the Virgine <HI>Mary</HI> wash the childs clouts.</P>
<P>And neere vnto the Sepulcher there is a great stone, clouen
with hammers, and set one piece a foot from another: and this
(say they) is the vayle of the Temple which rent in sunder at
the time of Christs suffering, which is most rediculous.</P>
<P>And although it be true (as we read <HI>Luke</HI> 19. 29. 30, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) that
Christ rode on that Asse which his two Disciples brought from
the village ouer against mount Oliuet, called <HI>Bethania</HI> or <HI>Beth∣phage,</HI>
(for they are both together) and as hee rode from the
mount of Oliues to Ierusalem, the people cried <HI>Hosanna,</HI> and
spread their garments in the way, and cut down branches from
the trées, and strawed them in the way.</P>
<P>Yet it is a rediculous matter, and a superstitious custome
for their chiefe Frier called <HI>Padre Guardian,</HI> euery Palme Sun∣day
in the morning to send two of his Friers from the mount of
Oliues to <HI>Betha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia</HI> to fetch the Colt of an Asse, and from thence
(in an apish imitation of Christ) the great one rideth on the litle
one towards <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the rest spread their garment on the
Asse, and in the way; and cut downe branches from the trees,
and straw them in the way.</P>
<P>Wiser are the Turkes herein then they, who although they
suffer them to come with their Asse to the gates of <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> yet
admit them not to enter into the gates in such manner.</P>
<P>And that Turke was to be commended, who (when the Fri∣ers
followed their <HI>Guardian</HI> in such sort riding on an Asse) seeing
a simple Christian woman strip her selfe so farre, as in modesty
she might, and spread her garments in the way; tooke a cudgel
and all to belabored her therewith, saying, Thou foole, art thou
so mad to thinke that this is Christ?</P>
<P>I, with the rest of my companions was at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> on
<PB N="135" REF="81"/>
Palme Sunday, but neither saw this, no heard of it vntill it
was done; for it séemed that they were ashamed that any man
of knowledge should behold such an absurd sight. But the
Frenchmen and Dutchmen, and many others of other nations
followed them, but not one Englishman, who could not pati∣ently
endure to see their Sauiour Christ so dishonoured.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bethania</HI> and <HI>Bethphage</HI> are many fig-trées growing, and
on this fig trée (say they) <HI>Zacheus</HI> (being a man of worship in a
famous Citie) like a boy climed vp to see Christ as he passed by.
<HI>Luke</HI> 19. 2, 3.</P>
<P>And at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> they take vpon them to shewe the place
where Christ made the <HI>Pater noster,</HI> &amp; where the Apostles made
the <HI>Creed,</HI> and where S. <HI>Stephen</HI> was stoned, and where <HI>Iudas</HI>
hanged himselfe. <HI>Pilats</HI> house. <HI>Peters</HI> prison. The garden
where he was betrayed. Where the Virgine <HI>Mary</HI> was in an
agony. Where Christ said to his mother, <HI>Ecce homo,</HI> and shee
said vnto him, <HI>Ecce mulier.</HI></P>
<P>On mount Oliuet there is a litle Chappell, and therein a stone,
whereon (say they) our Sauiour Christ trode when he ascended
into heauen; and the print of his toes remaine to be séene in that
stone to this day. There is indéed a dint in a stone, like vnto the
former part of a mans foote, but that it is the print or impres∣sion
of our Sauiours féet, who will beléeue that he trode so hard
to leaue any impression of his foot, or tipping of his toes behind?</P>
<P>At the foot of mount <HI>Oliuet,</HI> they shewed vs the valley of <HI>Ie∣hosapha;</HI>
and there (say they) shall bee set a throne at the day
of Iudgement, wherein Christ shall sit and kéepe his last iudge∣ment,
and all nations shall appeare before him, euen in this very
place, say they: as though any man could demonstrate the ve∣ry
particular place.</P>
<P>The ground of this opinion they fetch from <HI>Ioel</HI> 3. 2. where
God saith, <HI>I will g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther all nations, and will bring them downe
into the valley of Iehosaphat, &amp;c.</HI> which place they doe not, or
will not vnderstand. For it is to be vnderstood, either by the
way of alluding, as hauing regard to the valley where God mi∣raculously
slew the enemies of <HI>Jehosaphat:</HI> and so it may signi∣fie
the valley of destruction prepared for the wicked.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="81"/>
Or the Lord hath respect vnto the word <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> which
signifieth pleading or iudgement: because God would in the
day of Christ iudge the enemies of the Church, as then hee
did in the valley of <HI>Jehosaphat.</HI> Wherefore, it is not to bee vn∣derstood
of the materiall <HI>Josaphat,</HI> but of <HI>Josaphat</HI> so tearmed,
because the iudgement which heere shall bee pronounced, shall
resemble that which there was executed vpon the <HI>Moabites</HI>
and <HI>Amonites</HI> and the inhabitants of <HI>Seir.</HI></P>
<P>For what is <HI>Iosaphat</HI> (if you interpret it) but the iudgement
of the Lord? And what is the valley, but the depth of that iudge∣ment?
Into which <HI>Solomon</HI> doth assure the yoong man, that
God will bring him after all the iollity of his youth, after hée
hath chéered himselfe in the daies of his youth, and walked in
the way of his heart, and in his sight, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 11. 9.</P>
<P>After conference had with their <HI>Padre Vicatio</HI> (who was ac∣counted
the best learned amongst them) hauing told him thus
much in effect as I haue héere written, he asked me a reason
why the Prophet should specifie this place, if he meant not lite∣rally
to teach the Church, that héere this Iudge was to be ex∣pected?</P>
<P>My answer was: Two reasons had he to make choice of it,
by allusion to which he might shadow to the <HI>Iewes</HI> the day of
Iudgement.</P>
<P>One was the freshnesse of that famous deliuerances memo∣rie
which the Lord had wrought in it for them.</P>
<P>Another, the great resemblance that will be betwéene the ge∣nerall,
and that particular iudgement of his.</P>
<P>For from the time of this Prophet, yet had there not a mans
age passed, since (without stroke of theirs) the Lord had in this
valley, within the sight of this City, dispatched thrée whole ar∣mies,
which had ioined forces to beleager them: And further,
in such sort, as in that generall iudgement he will dispatch the
wicked. For as héere, though the <HI>Moabite,</HI> the <HI>Amonite,</HI> and
the inhabitant of <HI>Seir,</HI> bound themselues against <HI>Iuda,</HI> and yet
could not preuaile; so there, though the Moabitish flesh, the
Amonitish world, the sauage inhabitant of <HI>Seir</HI> the Deuill, en∣ter
a league against the elect, yet shall they haue no hand at
<PB N="137" REF="82"/>
them. As theirs had, so shall these and their complices haue,
swords of their owne consciences accusing them, to turne into
their owne bowels.</P>
<P>And as the same place was to them a valley of iudgement,
which to the <HI>Iewes</HI> was a valley of blessing; so shall that great
day be to the wicked a day of iudgement, for they shall receiue
that heauy doome, <HI>Goe you cursed;</HI> which to the godly shall be
a day of blessing, for they shall heare that ioifull voice, <HI>Come
you blessed, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Frier was not satisfied with this answer, but persisted
obstinate in his errour, and therefore I leaft him as I found
him, referring him to the triall thereof at the day of iudgement.</P>
<P>They say also, that the staires of the High Priests Hall,
whereupon our Sauiour trod when he went to be iudged, are
at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the nailes which nailed him to his Crosse. But
the Ecclesiasticall History reporteth, that <HI>Constantine</HI> made of
those nailes, when his mother had found them in the Mount
where Christ was crucified, a bridle and an helmet for his
owne vse. So bigge were the nailes, and such wide wounds
they made in his blessed hands and féet, that they were rather
digged than pierced: which also <HI>Dauid</HI> foreshewed by these
words, <HI>Psal.</HI> 22. 16. <HI>Foderunt manus meas &amp; pedes meos.</HI></P>
<P>And in the way from that which they call the High Priests
Hall, or the iudgement Hall, towards <HI>Mount Caluery,</HI> at the
end of the Lane, on the right hand: Héere (say they) they met
<HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Cyren,</HI> and compelled him to helpe Christ to beare his
Crosse when he fainted.</P>
<P>And going downe another Lane on the left hand, they poin∣ted
vnto an house, and said, Héere the rich glutton dwelt,
who refused to reléeue <HI>Lazarus,</HI> which is a Parable, and not
an History. And though it were a true History, yet who can
point with the finger at the particular place where the house
stood, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> hauing béene so often altered and transformed?</P>
<P>From thence turning vp towards Mount <HI>Caluarie,</HI> on the
right hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Veronica.</NOTE> they shew (vnto such as they thinke will beléeue
them) the house where a woman called <HI>Veronica</HI> dwelt, who
séeing our Sauiour Christ passe by her doore towards Mount
<PB N="138" REF="82"/>
<HI>Caluarie,</HI> and all in a sweat, she brought foorth a <HI>Sudarium,</HI> that
is, a napkin or handkerchiefe to wipe his face, which he recei∣ued,
and hauing wipt his face therewith, gaue it to her againe:
and therein (say they) remained the print of his face, and is to
be séene at <HI>S. Peters</HI> house at <HI>Rome</HI> to this present day.</P>
<P>There is also a City in <HI>Spaine</HI> which braggeth of the same
handkerchiefe: and the one is as like to be true as the other, but
both cannot be true. If they haue it at <HI>Rome,</HI> it cannot be at
<HI>Spaine:</HI> If at <HI>Spaine,</HI> not at <HI>Rome,</HI> if there were any such mat∣ter.
For if both should be true, to which of them should that

and granted ten thousand daies indulgence to them that

<HEAD>Doubtfull things.</HEAD>
<P>BEsides these things already set downe, whereof some are

shall doth see and heare whereof a man may suspend his iudge∣ment
whether they be true or false, vntill he either sée them, or
receiue further confirmation by reading, than he can by the af∣firmation
of some few superstitious persons. Of which sorte
are these following.</P>
<P>About a mile distant from the Citie, they brought vs to a
rockey place, where there is a vault vnder the ground as it
were a large, porch, from whence we entred into other intricate
roomes as it were into a Laberinth, by a great doore of stone
hewen out of the same place, hauing neither iron worke or tim∣ber
worke about it; but in the same place where it grew, there
it is squared, and made to turne about by the skilful Arte of cun∣ning
Masons, and it is of a huge thicknesse and greatnesse. So
<PB REF="84"/>
soone as we had passed that dore, we crept very lowe, as it were
into an Ouen mouth, euery man with a Candle in his hand; and
so came into a darke roome foure square, with Benches round a∣bout
of stone, hollow, like vnto Mangers, and therin (they say)
some of the noble famely of the Kings and Quéenes of <HI>Israel</HI> and
<HI>Iudah</HI> were buried.</P>
<P>From thence they brought vs into another roome of like sort,
and for like vse; &amp; so from one to another, that (without a guide)
it was impossible to find the way out. How many such roomes
there are, I know not: but wee were in six or seuen, and they
offered to bring vs into more, but being almost stifled for want
of light and aire, we desired to returne.</P>
<P>I make no qustion, but they were places of buriall; for in the
hollow benches of stone wee sawe bones of men: but whether
they were the sepulchers of the kings of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> or not,
is my doubt.</P>
<P>At the entrance in the Temple where the Sepulcher is to bee
séene, the first thing which they shew vnto strangers, is a faire
marble stone, euen with the ground; and there (say they) the
bodie of our Sauiour Christ was laid (when it was taken down
from the Crosse) whiles it was preparing to be laid in the Se∣pulcher.
And heere I saw many simple people (both men and
women) knéeling round about that stone, wringing their hands
wéeping, and crying, as if they had séene the dead bodie of our
Sauiour Christ there present before their eies. And they all to
be-kissed that stone. Yea, more then kissed it, for some of them
rubbed their lips vp and downe vpon that stone very often, vn∣till
they had rubbed off the skin and made their lips bléed. And
some of them rubbed their beads vpon it, that some inherent ho∣linesse
might come out of that stone, and rest vpon their beads.
I censure this superstition of theirs ouer fauourably, in num∣bring
this stone among doubtfull things, which I might rather
haue reckoned amongst manifest vntruts. For if there had béen
any such stone, it would haue béen either caried away by pieces,
or remoued whole to <HI>Rome</HI> as other reliques haue béene. But
this stone is too new to be of any such Antiquitie.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bethania</HI> they brought vs into a Celler vnder the ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bethania.</NOTE>
<PB REF="84"/>
ouer which there was no house, where <HI>Lazarus</HI> lay dead when
Christ raised him vp to life.</P>
<P>And at <HI>Bethphage</HI> they shewed vs the ruines of <HI>Simon</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bethphage.</NOTE>
Phariseis house, where Christ sitting at dinner, <HI>Mary Magda∣lene</HI>
came and powred ointment on his head, and washed his
féete with her teares, and dried them with the haire of her head.
For although no man denieth but that such things were done,
yet a man may make doubt whether those were the particular
places where they were done.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ierusalem</HI> they shewed vs <HI>Porta aurea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Porta aurea.</NOTE> that is, <HI>The gol∣den
gate;</HI> (or place where it stood) called in former times, <HI>The
beautifull gate of the Temple:</HI> which the Turkes haue walled
vp with stones, because of a prophecie, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Citie was
once wonne there, and shall be againe wonne at the same place.</P>
<P>Walking betwixt the valley of <HI>Gehinnom</HI> and the walles of
the Citie, our guide shewed vs a darke Chappell vnder the
ground without windowes, wherein (he told vs) the idolatrous
Iewes did offer &amp; sacrifice their children vnto a brasen Image,
called <HI>Moloch,</HI> which, being made hote, they inclosed them in
the hollownesse thereof, and so slew them. And lest their crying
should moue any to compassion towards them, they made a hi∣deous
noise with Tabrets and Drums. Whereupon the place
was called <HI>Tophet. Iere.</HI> 7. 31.</P>
<P>On the top of mount Oliuet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sodome.</NOTE> they shewed vs thirtie miles off
the lake of <HI>Sodom,</HI> which vnto vs appeared to bee very neere.
And they told vs thereof many strange matters. Not onely that
which the wiseman <HI>Solomon</HI> reported of it in his daies. <HI>Wisd.</HI>
10. 7. that it smoaketh, (as if hell had there found a chinmey
whereout to vent his smoake) and that the trées beare fruit that

nor preserueth any liuing creature. It is commonly called
<HI>Mare mortuum,</HI> that is, <HI>The dead sea;</HI> being so contagious, as
if a bird but flie ouer it, she is presently dampt, and falleth down
dead into it. And as S. <HI>Ierome</HI> saith: <HI>If by the swelling of <HI>Ior∣dan,</HI>
the fishes but flow ouer into it, they die straight and flote a∣boue
the waters.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, they further reported vnto vs of their owne knowledge,
<PB REF="85"/>
hauing (as shey said) séene the same, that it casteth out continu∣al
filthy vapours, by whose stinches and breath the mountaines
and valleys many miles about, are (as it were) scorched, bla∣sted,
and made vtterly barren: besides many vgly shapes and
shewes of terrour in it: besides apples of goodly colour grow∣ing
by it, which being touched turne all to smoake and ashes.</P>
<P>They also tolde vs that the piller of salt whereinto <HI>Lots</HI> wif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>But of these and many other things which they shewed vs,
and told vs, I make doubt; either because I haue not séene them
my selfe, or hauing séene them, doe not beléeue them.</P>
<P>When I shall with mine eyes behold them, I will more
boldly make report of them, and of other matters which offer
themselues vnto my sight in my returne, but which way to re∣turne
we haue not yet determined.</P>
<P>And thus being loth to interrupt your serious domesti∣call
