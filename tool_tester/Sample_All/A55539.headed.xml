<HEAD>To Her GRACE THE DUTCHESS OF ORMOND, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHere the Porticoes of Palaces stand like those of Temples, and the Great and the Fair leave their Accesses unbarr'd, Exalted Ho∣nour in that condescending Goodness, is so far from lessening its Grandeur, that it rather heightens its State; when True Magnificence must certainly consist in the Numbers of wondring Eyes around it, and Crowds of bending Knees before it. This Argument, which I hope I have not mistaken, is my best Warrant for this Confidence.</P>
<P>I confess, indeed, in my Approach to Your Grace, I ought to consider how I find your Court fill'd with Quality, whilst that Nobler Train throngs up Your Presence, that my poor Intru∣sion is a little too presumptuous. This truly I ought to consider, did I not at the same time reflect, that on the very Scaffolds at
<PB REF="3"/>
Coronations, there are some remoter Benches, (or to speak in my own Province) some Upper Gallery Seats, even for poorer Homagers; the Voice of Adoration, and Echoes of Triumph being not only loudest but sweetest, where all Tongues unite in the Choire; whilst the lowest Humility may make up as hearty, though not so gay, a part of the Ceremony.</P>
<P>From that Distant Bench, I beseech Your Grace to believe, that this Addressing Paper is handed down over the Heads of Honour to Your Grace's Feet. 'Tis true, I have dared to dedi∣cate this Trifle to Your Grace, and in it publish that piece of Boldness to the World, which how far they may forgive me, I am not so much concerned, provided Your own Descending Mercy vouchsafe my Pardon.</P>
<P>And thus enter'd under Your Grace's glittering Roof, my daz∣led Veneration presents me so large and so hallow'd a prospect, the concentring Worth of Two Illustrious Families, that in a long long Line from their Renown'd Originals, number their fair de∣volving Honours by Centuries. The Great <HI>Ormond,</HI> and Your bright Self, a fair last Branch of the Royal <HI>Plantage∣nets,</HI> so Noble an Union, in that successive Roll of Fame, bring up the splendid Reer to so distant a Front, Your Remoter Leading Ancestors, as requires a Travel into Annals for a full Survey; so ample Your Hereditary Glories, that 'tis a Voyage but to coast 'em.</P>
<P>But whither am I rapt! I am wandring into so spacious a Field, a speculation so far above me, that the Theme is too sacred for the trembling Pen of so poor a Mushroom Scribler to venture at, Your Graces Herald, and Your Panegyrist, being both an Attempt beyond my humble Talent. Besides, there's Ob∣ject
<PB REF="3"/>
enough for my Adoration in a nearer View of Your Grace's radiant Vertues; an Influence so powerful, Greatness so prideless, Wit so elevated, Piety so exemplary; and to crown all these, Your Nuptial Glory, a Conjugal Affection, so inimitable, that a mini∣string <HI>Cornelia</HI> might be proud to hold up Your Train; And all these lodged in so Beautiful a Personage, so sacred the Divi∣nity, and so bright the Shrine. The prospect, I say, of these sublime Perfections intirely takes up my humble Devotion; with∣out looking back into Urns and Monuments, Records and Chro∣nicles, for their Glorious Derivation. But my Contemplation of those Adorable Vertues is not alone sufficient; give me leave to Congratulate their Felicities too, the attending smiles of Pro∣vidence, Vertues divine Rewarder; when, as an earnest-bles∣sing, the Great <HI>Ormond,</HI> under the Victorious Royal Stan∣dard, has made his first Entry into a Grove of Lawrels, by hew∣ing out the possession of his recover'd Patrimony, by a Sword and an Arm, worthy the Inheriting Son of so Heroick a Fa∣ther. The Continuance of whose Fortunate Successes, the rich, fair Harvest of a Field of Honour abroad, and Your Grace's no less Trophies, the Pride and Ornament of a Court at home, (a fair divided Triumph between You) shall ever be the Prayers of,</P>

<L>PRepar'd to dam' my Play, methinks you sit</L>

<L>'Tis hard you won't allow in any Case</L>

<L>Since then—</L>
<L>I hope to find no Favour in your Eyes,</L>
<L>Who all new Plays before they're heard despise.</L>
<L>From you to the Fair Sex I now appeal,</L>
<L>To whom you dare not but be proud to kneel.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>Bright Ladies then, whose Rays throughout the Pit,</L>
<L>Do influence all around with Love and Wit,</L>
<L>"Oh tune their Iudgments e'er my Fate be known,</L>

<L>For with their <HI>FOIBLES</HI> did not you dispence,</L>
<L>Which of 'em to your Smiles cou'd plead pretence,</L>

<L>Since then 'tis Fancy gives gay Nonsence Charms,</L>
<L>Which the Fair Sex of Iudgment oft disarms;</L>
<L>Let Fancy too, that rules the Wise, the Brave,</L>
<L>That makes a Captive free, a Prince a slave,</L>
<L>The Lawyer honest, th' Honest Man a Knave;</L>
<L>That gives Content to Cuckolds, Wealth to th' Poor,</L>
<L>To Courtiers Friendship, true Love to a Whore;</L>

<L>Who hides her Face on purpose to be seen,</L>
<L>And Apes of Quality, fond Misses think</L>

<L>Fancying their Beauty 'tis that so prevails,</L>
<L>When we all know the Charm lies in their <HI>T—ls.</HI></L>

<L>AS a young sprightly Widow of the Town,</L>
<L>That had some year's the marriage Comforts known.</L>
<L>Believing She had once the best of Men,</L>
<L>Resolves to try her Fortune o'er agin:</L>
<L>So our Young scribling Fool, that found before</L>
<L>Your kind Indulgence, needs must write once more.</L>
<L>Plagu'd with an Itch that does through Poets run,</L>
<L>Who once being enter'd, never can have done.</L>

<L>He says my Intercession cannot fail,</L>
<L>And that a pleading Female▪ must prevail.</L>
<L>I told him, I shou'd never help his Play,</L>
<L>As having ne'er oblig'd, I mean your way,</L>
<L>And that in times of War you Women chuse,</L>
<L>Iust like Iack-Boots, only for present use.</L>
<L>Till your Convenience serv'd to stand at door,</L>
<L>Then laid by, by the Footman to be wore.</L>
<L>Bus'ness of Love moves now no tender Passion,</L>
<L>Your Heads are buzz'd with bus'ness of the Nation;</L>
<L>And when your Ladies sigh for a soft word,</L>
<L>Tou roar, Boy, bring my Pistols, fetch my Sword.</L>
<L>What Hopes then I cou'd have he well might guess;</L>
<L>Pray Heav'n▪ these jarring days may quickly cease.</L>
<L>Women and Misers always pray for peace.</L>
<L>Plunder of Gold, the Miser's fear does move,</L>
<L>Ours, that we shall not plunder'd be of Love.</L>
<L>For to say truth, tho' Souldiers all are brave,</L>
<L>They're the worst Lovers that our Sex can have.</L>
<L>For now adays, their duty grows so hard,</L>
<L>They 're always Resty when they mount our Guard.</L>
<L>However I must try my Luck▪ If then</L>
<L>There chance to be amongst you, Gentlemen,</L>
<L>Any so kind to hear what I can say,</L>
<L>Them I invoke in favour of this Play.</L>
<L>It has some Wit, tho' mix'd with many a Fau't,</L>
<L>Some little Fancy too; but as for Plot,</L>
<L>There are so many New ones found elsewhere,</L>
<L>He thought not worth his time to make one here;</L>
<L>And therefore tho' you can't that Part applaud,</L>
<L>Clap now, for there's a Pumpkin Plot abread.</L>
