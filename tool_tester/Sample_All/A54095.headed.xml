<HEAD>THE Preface to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THis Ensuing <HI>Journal</HI> of my Travils in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> in the Service of the Gospel of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, was written for my own and some Relations, and per∣ticular Friends Satisfaction, as the long time it hath lain silent doth show: But a Copy that was found amongst the late <HI>Countess of Con∣naway</HI>'s Papers, falling into the Hands of a Person that much fre∣quented that Family, he was ear∣nest with me, both by himself and others, to have leave to Publish it for a Common Good: Which upon, per∣usal, I have found a willingness to
<PB REF="3"/>
comply with, hoping that the Lord will make the Reading of it Effe∣ctual to some into whose Hands it may Fall; as well those who have received a Dispensation of the same Ministry, for Their Encouragement in their Publick Service for God, as those who are under the same Ministry, unto Zeal and Faithful∣ness. For it is the Glorious Gos∣pel-Day in which God is Exalting his Dear <HI>Son,</HI> as <HI>Prophet, Priest,</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> in the Hearts of his People. Oh, that the Nations would hear him, their only <HI>Saving Health,</HI> and <HI>Israels</HI> great <HI>Shep∣herd!</HI> who takes care of his Sheep, that hear his Voice, and gives unto them that follow him, in the daily Cross, unto Regeneration, <HI>Eternal Life:</HI> And who hath sent, and is
<PB REF="3"/>
sending forth his Servants to ga∣ther home the Sheep that are gone astray in all Nations, that so there may be but <HI>One Shepherd</HI> and <HI>One Sheepfold,</HI> according to the Glori∣ous Promise made to these latter Times; In which he would be the <HI>Teacher of his People himself:</HI> For he is Teaching thousands, by the Light, Spirit and Grace of his Son Christ, in whom he is well pleased. To this, God hath sent forth his Ser∣vants in this Day, to turn all Peo∣ple, as God's <HI>Call</HI> and <HI>Visitation</HI> to the Nations: And blessed are all those that Hearken to this Testi∣mony, both Mediately and Immedi∣ately. For God is awakening Men to the Knowledge of his Glory in the Face or Appearance of Christ, by his Spirit in their Hearts and
<PB REF="4"/>
Consciences, which reveal to Men the Father; yea, the deep things of God.</P>
<P>Oh, that they would Hear, and Fear, and Learn the things that make for their Eternal Peace! For if the Righteous scarcely are saved, where, O where, shall they appear that neglect so great <HI>Salvation!</HI> A Salvation that comes <HI>so neer</HI> them, as to knock at the door of their Hearts; that teaches them and trys their Reins, and tells un∣to them their most inward Thoughts; and brings a Time of Judgment o∣ver all their Words and Works. This is Christ Jesus the Light of the World, that was given of God for <HI>Salvation</HI> to the ends of the Earth. He has <HI>Enlightned</HI> all, and <HI>Shines</HI> to all, and <HI>Calls</HI> all, that
<PB REF="4"/>
they should see their Sins and be sor∣ry for them, and forsake them, and take up his dayly <HI>Cross</HI> and follow him whom God hath given for an <HI>Example</HI> as well as a <HI>Propitiati∣on</HI> for our Sins. And none can know him to be their <HI>Propitiation</HI> that rejest him as their <HI>Example</HI> and Leader in their Lives and Conver∣sations. Wherefore, <HI>Reader,</HI> be Serious, Inward and Inquisitive for thy Souls Sake. What Faith hast thou? One that over-comes the World, or one that the Spirit of the World over-comes, which is not the Faith of God's Elect, without which we cannot please God. For that Faith works <HI>by love.</HI> Such a love to God as will not affend him, but seeks his Glory through a most willing Obedience to his Holy Will.
<PB REF="5"/>
Blessed are the Souls in which this love dwells. For such have none in Heaven but God, nor in the Earth in comparison of him: As they receive all good from him, so they resign all up to him; and tho' it be through many Tribulations that they must attain the rest of God, yet as nothing can seperate them from his love, so neither can a∣nything deprive them of their Re∣ward in the End.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>Reader,</HI> be thou perswaded to take thy Lot among that blessed Number, if thou art not yet one of them. Thou seest the way to that Divine Priviledge; walk in it; for the End Crowns all: If one of that number, that have chosen God for their Portion, be Di∣ligent, Zealous, and fervent in the
<PB REF="5"/>
Work and Service of God. Re∣deem thy Time and Run thy Race, with care and constancy; <HI>looking to Jesus the Author, that he may be the Finisher of thy Faith.</HI> Remember who said, <HI>there are many Mansions prepared</HI> for the Faithful. Do we beleive and look for another World? Let us not then live in this as if there were no other. Let our Eyes be upon our better World, and live here as Strangers that are but on our way to our Eternal Home; that so we may Answer the End of God's Love by working out the Salvation of our own Souls (by his Power) with fear and Trembling; knowing God will Judge all, by Christ Jesus, according to the Deeds done in the Body.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/><HI>Reader,</HI> this <HI>Journal</HI> is of a Religious Voyage, and has some passages in it that may Engage thy Soul to Seriousness, and let the see how Good▪ God is to those that go of his Holy Errands. May'st thou be heartily affected with this Testimony of his Love and Presence with his People; and feel good de∣sires raised in thee to serve the Lord also, according to his blessed will in thy day, that Peace thou may'st know to thy Soul when time here shall be no more. I am</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF MY JOURNEY INTO Holland <HI>and</HI> Germany.</HEAD>
<P>BEING the First Day of the Week,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d. 5. Month. London.</NOTE> I left my Dear▪ Wife and Family at <HI>Worminghurst</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> in the Fear and Love of God, and came well to <HI>London</HI> that Night.</P>
<P>The next day I Emploied my self on Friends behalf that were in Suffer∣ings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Essex.</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
till the Evening, and then went to my own Mothers in <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning I took my Jour∣ney to <HI>Colchester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">24th. Colche∣ster.</NOTE> and met <HI>George Wats</HI> of <HI>London</HI> upon the Way, who return∣ed with me, and came well to that Town that Evening. We lodged at <HI>John Furly</HI>'s the Elder, but had a Blessed Meeting at <HI>Jonathan Furly</HI>'s House that Night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25th. Harwich.</NOTE>The next Morning early I left <HI>Col∣chester,</HI> and came to <HI>Harwich</HI> about Nine, accompanied with <HI>George Wats</HI> and <HI>John Furly</HI> the Elder, <HI>William Tall∣coat,</HI> and <HI>J. Whiterly</HI> of <HI>Colchester,</HI> where we found dear <HI>G. F.</HI> at <HI>J. Van∣derwall</HI>'s House, with many more Friends.</P>
<P>After Dinner we went all to the Meeting, where the Lord gave us a Blessed Earnest of his Love' and Pre∣sence that should be with us in this Voyage; for his overcoming refresh∣ing Power did open all our Hearts, and many of our Mouths in Ministry, Prayer and Praises, to the Magnifying of his own Name, and Truth in that
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
Place. The Meeting done, we re∣turned to <HI>John Vanderwall</HI>'s House, where we took our leave of Friends, that is to say, of the Friends of that place, with others that came with us, or met us there; and so we went on Board of the <HI>Pacquet-boat,</HI> where (by the special Favour of the Master of the <HI>Pacquets</HI> to me, having formerly served under my Father) we had the best Accommodation given to us: Many of the Friends accompanied us to the Ship, not leaving us till all was fixt, and then we parted in the Fel∣lowship of Jesus. Those that came over were <HI>G. Fox, G. Keith, R. Barclay, G. Wats, J. Furly, W. Tall∣coat, E. Keith,</HI> My self, with two of our Servants. We set Sail a∣bout Three in the Morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Month.</NOTE> being the fifth day of the Week, and got the Sixth day at Night within half a League of the <HI>Briel</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th.</NOTE> we had good Ser∣vice those two daies in the Ship with several Passengers <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and though they seemed at first to be Shy of us, and to Slight us, yet at
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
last their Hearts were much Opened in kindness towards us, and the uni∣versal Principle had place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th. Briel.</NOTE>The next Morning Friends were fetcht on Shore by a Boat of <HI>Rotter∣dam,</HI> with some Friends of that City that came to the <HI>Briel</HI> to meet us; the Friends that came were <HI>A. Sonneman, B. Furly</HI> and <HI>J. Johnson, Yetterkeuken,</HI> with three Young Men that live at <HI>B. Furly</HI>'s House.</P>
<P>After we had Eaten, we took Boat immediately for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rotter∣dam.</NOTE> where we arrived about Noon, and where many Friends came to see us, among whom we were comforted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th.</NOTE>The next day being the First day of the Week, we had two Meetings at <HI>B. Furly</HI>'s House, whither resorted a great Company of People, some of them being of the considerablest Note of that City. And Oh, blessed be the true Word of Life that never fail∣ed them that rest upon it, and abide in it! The Gospel was Preached, the Dead was Raised, and the Living Comforted, and God even our God
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
bore Heavenly Record to his only be∣gotten Son in us; and Truth is ho∣nourable in the Eyes of several of that place.</P>
<P>The next day being the Second day of the Week,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th. 5 Month.</NOTE> we spent in visiting Friends from House to House, not in one Company, being lodged in several quarters of the City. All our Visits were Precious Meetings, for indeed for that end God brought us into this Land. Several of us Dined and Sup∣ped that day at two great Men's Houses, where we had blessed Oppor∣tunities to make known unto them what was the Hope of our Glory, that Mystery, which to the Gentiles is now revealing, even Christ Jesus the Light of the World manifested in us.</P>
<P>The next day being the Third day of the Week,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31st.</NOTE> <HI>G.F. J.F. W.T.</HI> and my self, after having broken our Fast at <HI>A. Sonneman</HI>'s, took Boat for <HI>Leyden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leyden.</NOTE> where we came that Night in Order to be at <HI>Haerlem</HI> next day at a Meeting ap∣pointed by <HI>G.F.</HI> and my self from
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<HI>Rotterdam,</HI> being accompanied by <HI>J. Bocliffs, J. Arents</HI> and <HI>J. Claus</HI> that came from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> on purpose to conduct us thither.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1st 6 Month. Haerlem.</NOTE>At <HI>Haerlem</HI> we arrived about the 11<HI>th.</HI> Hour, and went to the House of a good Old Man, that had long wai∣ted for, and is now come to behold the Consolation and Salvation of <HI>Israel.</HI> After we had a little refresht our selves, we went to the Meeting, where the Lord gave us a blessed Op∣portunity, not only with respect to Friends, but many sober Baptists and Professors that came in, and abode in the Meeting, to the End; <HI>Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Meeting done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amster∣dam.</NOTE> we went to <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in Company with several Friends of that City, and of <HI>Alchmaer</HI> and <HI>Embden,</HI> who met us at the Meet∣ing at <HI>Haerlem,</HI> and we were lodged at <HI>Getrueydt Dirck</HI>'s House. <HI>G. K.</HI> and his Wife, and <HI>R. B.</HI> stayed over the Fourth day's Meeting at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and so came not till the next day, which was the day of the general
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Meeting of Friends in this Country.</P>
<P>The Fifth day of the Week at <HI>G. D</HI>'s House the general Meeting was held both of Men and Women.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th. 6 Month.</NOTE> And the Lord who is setting up his own Kingdom by his own Power, owned us with his own blessed Presence, and opened us in that Wisdom and Love, that all things Ended with Peace, great Concord and Comfort, many things being Spoken, especially by our Dear Friend <HI>G. F.</HI> that were of good Ser∣vice; and I hope will dwell with them for ever. These several things being agreed upon, being of good Savour and Report, I think fit here to insert them.

<HEAD>At the General Meeting of Friends at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the <HI>12</HI>th. of the <HI>6</HI>th. Month, <HI>1677.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. BE it known to all Men that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> power of God, the Gospel, is the Authority of all our Mens and Wo∣mens Meetings, and every Heir of that Power is an Heir of that Authority, and so becometh a living Member of right of either of those Meetings, and of the Heavenly Fellowship and Or∣der in which they stand, which is not of Man, nor by Man.</P>
<P N="2">2. That each Monthly Meeting have a Collection apart; and also that there be another Collection quar∣terly at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> from each Meeting for general Services, and that it be disposed of but by the consent of the said Quarterly Meeting.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is Agreed upon, that hence∣forth a Yearly Meeting be held here at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> unto which Friends in the <HI>Palatinate, Hambrough, Lubeck</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<HI>Frederickstadt,</HI> &amp;c. be invited, of which Meeting there shall be given Notice to the Friends of the Year∣ly Meeting at <HI>London,</HI> to be kept al∣ways on the first day of that Week, which is fully the third Week follow∣ing after the Yearly Meeting at <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is also Agreed upon, that henceforth this General Meeting is to be changed into a Quarterly Meeting, and that the first Quarterly Meeting hereafter shall be held on the second first day of the ninth Month following, and so forth every Quarter on the second first day of the Month; this second of the nine Month is to be this first Quar∣terly Meeting.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is also Agreed, that henceforth a Monthly Meeting in <HI>Vriesland</HI> should be Established, as also at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and that on the second second day of each Month, and at <HI>Harlingen</HI> upon the third third day of the Month.</P>
<P N="6">6. Further, that in the interim, the Friends of <HI>Alchmaer</HI> and <HI>Haerlem</HI> and <HI>Waterland,</HI> are to have their Monthly
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Meeting with Friends at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and to begin the said Meeting the sixth, seventh Month, and so forth alwaies upon the first second day of the first week of the Month at the Eighth Hour.</P>
<P N="7">7. And further concerning Gospel▪order, though the Doctrine of Christ Jesus requireth his People to admonish a Brother or Sister twice, before they tell the Church, yet that limiteth none, so as that they shall use no lon∣ger forbearance before they tell the Church, but that they shall not less than twice admonish their Brother or Sister before they tell the Church; and it is desired of all, that before they publickly complain, they so wait in the Power of God to feel if there is no more required of them to their Bro∣ther or Sister, before they expose him or her to the Church. Let this be weightily considered.</P>
<P N="8">8. And farther, when the Church is told, and the party admonisht by the Church again and again, and he or she remain still unsensible or unrecon∣ciled,
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
let not final Judgment go forth against him or her, till every one of the Meeting hath cleared his or her Consci∣ence, that if any thing be insisted upon any farther to visit such a Transgres∣sour, they may clear themselves, if possibly the party may he reacht and saved, and after all clear of the Blood of such an one. Let the Judgments of Friends in the Power of God go forth against him or her, as moved for the Lord's Honour and Glory's Sake, that no reproach may come or rest upon God's Holy Name, Truth and People.</P>
<P N="9">9. As much as possible can be, let all Difference be ended by some honest Friends, and trouble not the Monthly or Quarterly Meetings with them; and if that will not doe, proceed to your particular Monthly Meetings; but if they be not there ended neither, then take aside six honest Friends out of the Quarterly Meeting, and let them hear and determine the matter; and in case any Person or Persons be so obstinate as that they refuse the Sense and Love of Friends, and will not comply with
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
them, then to proceed towards them according to the way of Truth in such Cases.</P>
<P N="10">10. That all such as behold their Brother or Sister in a Transgression, go not in a Rough, Light, or upbraid∣ing Spirit to reprove or admonish him or her, but in the Power of the Lord and Spirit of the Lamb; in the Wis∣dom and Love of the Truth which suffereth thereby to admonish such an Offender, so may the Soul of such a Brother or Sister be seasonably and ef∣fectually reach'd unto, and overcome, and have cause to bless the Name of the Lord on their behalf, and so a bles∣sing may be rewarded into the Bo∣som of the Faithful and tender Bro∣ther or Sister that so admonisheth.</P>
<P N="11">11. And be it known unto all, we cast out none from among us; for if they go from the Light, and Spirit, and Power, in which our Unity is, they cast out themselves; and it has been our way to admonish them, that they may come to the Spirit and Light of God which they are gone from,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
and so come into the Unity again. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Fellowship standeth in the Light, that the World hateth, and in the Spi∣rit, that the World grieveth, vexeth and quencheth; and if they will not hear our Admonitions, the Light con∣demneth them, and then goeth our Testimony out against them.</P>
<P N="12">12. That no Condemnation is to go farther than the Transgression is known, and if he or she return and give forth a Condemnation against him or her self, (which is more de∣sireable than that we should do it) this is a Testimony of his or her Re∣pentance and Resurrection before God, his People and the whole World. As <HI>David</HI> when <HI>Nathan</HI> came to admonish him, <HI>Psalm</HI> 51.</P>
<P N="13">13. That no Testimony by way of Condemnation be given forth against any Man or Woman (whatever crime they commit) before Admonition, and till such time as they have had Gospel-order according to Christ's Do∣ctrine.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="14" REF="13"/>14. And if any Brother or Sister hear any Report of any Brother or Sister, let him or her go to the Par∣ty, and know the Truth of the Re∣port; and if true, let the thing be judged; if false, go thou to the Re∣porter, and let him or her be judg∣ed, and if any should report it at a second or third hand, without going to the party of whom the Report go∣eth, let such be brought to Judgment, for thou shalt neither raise nor suffer a false Report to lie upon my People, saith the Lord, for they are to be Ho∣ly as he is Holy, and Just as he is Just.</P>
<P N="15">15. And if any Controversie, or Weakness should appear in either Mens or Womens Meeting, let it not be told out of your Meetings, because such Speeches tend to the defaming of such Persons and Meetings, and to the Hurt of the common Unity, and Breach of the Heavenly Society and Previlege.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="meeting report">
<P>Next day (notice being already given) we had a large publick Meet∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th. 6 <HI>Month.</HI></NOTE> in which the sound of the ever∣lasting, Gospel, Testament and Cove∣nant went forth, and the Meeting ended with a sweet and weighty Sense; that Evening we had a more se∣lect meeting of Friends than the day before, in which the Nature of Mar∣riage, and the practice of Friends re∣lating to it, and other things were ve∣ry weightily and closely discoursed; the Resolutions were these following.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Scruple concerning the Law of the Magistrate about Marriage, being proposed and discoursed of in the fear of God among Friends in a Select Meeting, it was the universal and un∣animous sense of Friends, that joining in Marriage is the work of the <HI>Lord only,</HI> and not of Priest or Magistrate; For 'tis God's Ordinance and not Man's, and therefore Friends cannot consent that they should join them together; for we Marry none; 'tis the Lord's Work and we are but Witnesses.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="14"/>2. But yet if a Friend through ten∣derness have a desire that the Magi¦strate should know it before the Marriage be concluded, they may pub∣lish the same, after the thing hath by Friends been found clear, and after the Marriage is performed in a pub∣lick Meeting of Friends and others, according to the Holy Order and Pra∣ctice of Friends in Truth throughout the World, (the manner of the holy Men and Women of old) to go and carry a Copy of the Certificate to the Magistrate, they are left to their freedom herein, that if they please they may Register it. But for Priests or Magistrates to marry, or join any in that Relation, it's not according to Scripture; and our Testimony and Practice have been alwaies against it. It was God's work before the Fall, and it's God's work only in the Re∣storation.</P>
<P N="3">3. If any Friend have it upon him to reprint any Book already Printed and approved either in <HI>England</HI> or here, they may do it upon their own Charges.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="17" REF="14"/>4. It is also agreed that the care of reading and approving Books be laid upon some of every Meeting, to the end no Book may be Publisht but in the Unity, yet any other faithful Friends not so Nominated, are not thereby excluded, though in all these cases it is desired, that all would avoid unnecessary Disputes about words, which profit not, but keep in the love that Edifieth.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is farther concluded that the general Stock of the Quarterly Meeting be not disposed of, but by the consent of the Quarterly Meeting; but if be∣twixt times there should be a pressing necessity concerning the Publick, let that monthly Meeting, where it shall fall out, lay down the Money, and give in an Account at the next Quarterly Meeting in Order to their Relief, if it appear that they are thereby over∣charged; and let all things be done without Favour, Affection, Relation, or any respect to Persons, even for the Lord's Sake and his blessed Everlasting Truth, that God may bless and pro∣sper

his People. And let all things be written down, both as to your monthly and quarterly meeting Col∣lections, what you Receive, what you Disburse, that all may be fair and clear to the satisfaction of all that desire to see and Examine the Books. And the Lord's Fear and Life and Power was over all, in which the Lord God pre∣serve his for ever.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>TO THE KING OF POLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Great Prince,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>ACtions of Justice, Mercy and Truth are worthy of all Men, but in a most excellent manner of the serious con∣sideration of Kings and Princes. We certain Inhabitants of the City of</HI> Dant∣zick <HI>have been long great Sufferers, not for any Wickedness committed against the Royal Law of God, or any Breach of those Civil Laws of this City that relate to the well Government of it in all Na∣tural and Civil things; but purely and only for the cause of our Tender Consci∣ences towards God. This severity being by us represented to the Magistrates of this City, we could not as yet receive from them any Relief, some expressing; as if easing the Burthen of our Oppressions
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>
should give thee, O King, an occasion of Dissatisfaction against them, who art our acknowleged Protector. Being thus ne∣cessitated, and in a manner driven to make this address unto Thee, take it not amiss, that we with that Humility and Patience, that becometh the Servants and followers of Jesus, and with all manner of Chri∣stian respect and sincerity of Mind, brief∣ly relate to Thee, the most Fundamental Principles most surely believed by us, which we hope Thou wilt believe deserve not those Punishments, that are inflict∣ed upon us as evil doers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We do reverently believe that there is one God and Father, one Lord Jesus Christ, and one Holy Spirit, and these three are one,</HI> Eph. 4.6.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to have been given forth by Divine Inspiration, and that they are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness,</HI> able to make the Man of God wise unto Salvation through Faith which is in Christ Jesus, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15, 16.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="16"/>3. <HI>That these Holy Scriptures are not to be understood, but by the Discoveries, Teachings and Operations of that Eternal Spirit from whence they came.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>We beleive that all Mankind through Disobedience to the Spirit of God are fallen short of the Glory of God, and in that State are under Condemnation; but that God out of his infinite Goodness and Kindness, hath sent his Son a Light into the World, that whosoever believeth and obeyeth this Light should not abide in Darkness, but have the Light of E∣ternal Life.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We believe this Gift of Light and Grace through Jesus Christ to be Ʋni∣versal, and that there is not a Man or Woman upon Earth, that hath not a sufficient measure of this Light, and to whom this Grace hath not appeared to re∣prove their ungodly Works of Darkness, and to lead them that obey it to Eternal Sal∣vation. And this is the great Condem∣nation of the World at this Day, under all their great professions of God, Christ, Spirit and Scriptures; that though Christ hath enlightned them, yet they will not
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
bring their Deeds to the Light, but hate the Light, and love their dark Cu∣stoms and Practices rather than the Light,</HI> because their Deeds are Evil.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>We do believe in the Birth, Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Resurrecti∣on and Ascension of Jesus Christ our Lord, and that he laid down his Life for the Ʋngodly, not to continue so, but that they should deny their Wickedness and Ʋngodliness, and live Soberly, Righteously and Godlikely in this pre∣sent evil World, as the Saints of old did, that were redeemed from the Earth, and sat in Heavenly places.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>We do believe, that as the Devil through Man's Disobedience brought sin into Man's Heart, so Christ Jesus, through Man's Belief in, and Obedience to his Holy Spirit, Light and Grace, cleanseth the Heart of Sin, destroyeth the Works of the Devil, finisheth Trans∣gression and bringeth in everlasting Righteousness; that as the Devil hath had his Kingdom of Darkness in Man, so Christ may have his Kingdom of Light, Life, Righteousness, Peace and
<PB N="23" REF="17"/>
Joy in the Holy Ghost in the Heart of Man, and not that Christ Jesus saveth Men from Wrath and not from-Sin</HI>; for the Wages of Sin is Death <HI>in whose heart soever it liveth,</HI> but the Gift of God is Eternal Life <HI>to all that believe and obey through Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>We do believe that all true Mini∣stry and Worship only stand in the experi∣mental Sense, Operations and Leadings of this Holy Light, Spirit, or Grace, that is shed abroad in the Hearts of Men and Women, to conduct them in the Holy way of Regeneration unto Life Eternal; this was the Ancient Aposto∣lical Doctrine, they spoke what they had seen, Tasted and Handled of the Word of God. And this is our Faith, Doctrine and Practice in this day. And be not displeased with us, O King, we intreat thee, if we give this for the rea∣son of our absenting our selves from the publick and common Ministry or Wor∣ship, Namely, that we have no Taste or Relish, no Sense or Evidence that their Ministry and Worship are Authorized
<PB N="24" REF="18"/>
and performed by the Apostolical Power and Spirit of Jesus, but rather that they are the Inventions, Studies and Powers of Man's Nature, all which are but strange Fire, and therefore cannot kin∣dle a true and acceptable Sacrifice to God, for it is not Man's Spirit and degene∣rate Nature, Speaking and Professing the Words of God's Spirit that giveth acceptance with the Lord, or adminstreth Heavenly Edification to Men, nor can we believe, that where Envy, Passion, Wrath, Malice, Persecution, Envy and Strife, Lusts, Vanity, Wantonness and Worldly Mindedness have such Sway and Power, that the true Christian Spirit, Life and Doctrine can be heartily re∣ceived and followed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as this is the Reason in the sight and presence of that God that made Heaven and Earth, and will Judge the Quick and Dead, wherefore we cannot join in the common and publick Wor∣ship of these parts, so doth the same Light and Spirit of God lay an Holy necessity upon us with a Meek and Quiet Spirit to come together after the man∣ner
<PB N="25" REF="18"/>
of the Ancient Christians, that were the true Followers of Jesus; and with Godly fear and a retired Mind to wait upon God, and Meditate in his Holy Law of Life, that he hath writ in our Hearts according to his New Covenant-Promise that he may Feed us, Teach us, Strengthen us, and Comfort us in our in∣ward Man; and as by this Holy Spirit ac∣cording to the Practice of the Churches of Old, any are inclined or moved to Reprove, Exhort, Admonish, Praise, or Pray, we are found exercised in these Holy Practices.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> O Prince, <HI>give us poor Christi∣ans leave to Expostulate with Thee. Did Christ Jesus or his Holy Followers en∣deavour by Precept or Example to set up their Religion with a Carnal Sword? Called he any Troops of Men or Angels to defend him? Did he encourage</HI> Peter <HI>to dispute his escape with the Sword? But did he not say put it up? Or did he countenance his over zealous Disciples, when they would have had Fire from Hea∣ven to destroy those that were not of their Mind? No, but did not Christ
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>
rebuke them, saying, ye know not what Spirit ye are of? And if it was neither Christ's Spirit, nor their own Spirit that would have Fire from Heaven? Oh! what is that Spirit that would kindl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire on Earth, to destroy such as peaceably dis∣sent upon the account of Conscience; if we may not wish that God would smite Men of other judgments, because they differ from us, (in which there is no use of Carnal Weapons) can we so far de∣ceive our selves, as to esteem our selves Christians and Followers of Christ, whilst we incourage Men with Worldly Weapons to persecute such as dissent from us? O King! When did the true Religion Per∣secute? When did the true Church offer Violence for Religion? Were not her Weapons, Prayers, Tears, and Patience? Did not Jesus conquer by those Weapons, and vanquish Cruelty by Suffering? Can Clubs, and Staves, and Swords, and Pri∣sons, and Banishments reach the Soul, convert the Heart, or convince the un∣derstanding of Man? When did violence ever make a true Convert? Or bodily punishments a sincere Christian? This
<PB N="27" REF="19"/>
maketh void the end of Christ's coming, which is to save Men's lives and not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estroy them, to perswade them and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o force them; yea it robbeth God's Spi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of its Office, which is to convince the World, that is, the Sword by which the Ancient Christians overcame: It was the Apostle's Testimony, that their Wea∣pons were not Carnal but Spiritual, but the Practice of their pretended Successors proveth, that there Weapons are not Spiritual, but Carnal: Suppose we are Tares, as the true Wheat hath alwaies been called, yet pluck us not up for Christ's Sake, who saith,</HI> Let the Tares and the Wheat grow together until the Har∣vest, <HI>that is,</HI> till the End of the World; <HI>let God have his due as well as</HI> Caesar; <HI>the judgment of Conscience belongeth to him; and mistakes about Religion are best known to him. And here give us leave to mind thee of a noble Saying of one of thy Ancestors,</HI> Stephen <HI>King of</HI> Poland, I am King of Men, not of Consci∣ences; King of Bodies, not of Souls; <HI>and there have been found and still are among the Emperors, Kings, Princes
<PB N="28" REF="20"/>
and States of the World, some that have had that noble Spirit of indulging their Conscientious dissenting Subjects, and not only with</HI> Gamaliel <HI>and</HI> Gallio <HI>not to persecute, but also eminently to protect and defend them from the Hatred and Violence of their Enemies. Be not then less Noble than they, consider how Quietly and Comfortably our Friends live under other Governments. And indeed we con∣ceive it to be the Prudence of the Kings and States of the World; for if the wise Man say true, The Glory of a Prince is in the Multitude of his People; but this Practice saith, No, the Glory of a Prince is in the Conformity of the People to the Canons of the Clergy; which seemeth to strike at all Civil Society, which con∣sisteth in Men of Virtue, Parts, Arts and Industry. But let Men have never such excellent Abilities, be never so Ho∣nest, Peaceable and Industrious, all which render them good and profitable Subjects to the Prince, yet they must not live within their Native Country, unless they will sacrifice the Peace of their Con∣sciences by an Hypocritical Submission to
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>
the Canons and Fashions of the Church: Is not this, O Prince, to set the Church a∣bove the State? The Bishop above the King? to waste and give away the Strength and Glory of a Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O that thou mayest be wise even in thy Generation, and use the Power that God hath given thee, for God and Truth and Righteousness, that therein thou mayest be like unto God, who</HI> Peter <HI>telleth us,</HI> Accepteth of all that fear him and work Righteousness throughout the World, whose Sun shineth upon all, whose Rain cometh upon all.</P>
<P><HI>And least any should be so injurious to us, as to render us Enemies to Civil Go∣vernment; Be it known unto thee, O King, that we Honour all Men in the Lord, not with the vain invented Honours of this World, but with the true and solid Ho∣nour that cometh from above; but much more Kings, and those whom God hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laced in Authority over us; for we be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieve Magistracy to be both Lawfull and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sefull for the Terrifying of all Evil Do∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, and the Praise and Encouragement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f those that do well.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="21"/><HI>The Premises duely Considered, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣treat thee, O Prince, to take our suffering Case into thy serious Regard, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Power and Influence thou hadst with the Magistrates of this City to recom∣mend our suffering Condition to their se∣rious Consideration, that we may no lon∣ger lie under these not only Ʋnchristi∣an, but Ʋnnatural Severities, but re∣ceive that speedy and effectual Relief which becometh Christian Magistrates to give to their own sober and Christian People.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15th. 6. Month.</NOTE>The first day of the Week being come, the Meeting began about the Eleventh Hour, and held till about the Fourth Hour in the Afternoon. There was a mighty Concourse of People from several places of this Coun∣try, and that of several Perswasions, <HI>Baptists, Presbyterians, Socinians, See∣kers,</HI> &amp;c. and God was with his Peo∣ple, and his Word of Life and Power, of Wisdom and Strength covered them; yea the hidden things both of <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> the mystery both of Iniquity and Godliness were opened
<PB N="31" REF="21"/>
and declared in the Demonstration of the Eternal Spirit that day; and, O Blessed and Magnified be the Name of the Lord that hath not only not left himself, but also his Servants not with∣out a Witness! Oh, he is worthy to be Lov'd and Fear'd, and Obey'd, and Reverenced for ever!</P>
<P>The next day <HI>G.K. R.B. B.F.</HI> and my self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th.</NOTE> having taken our leave of dear <HI>G.F.</HI> and Friends, took Boat for <HI>Naerden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naerden.</NOTE> where we Arrived about the Second Hour in the Afternoon, and after having Eaten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th.</NOTE> we took our leave of those Friends that had Accompani∣ed us hither, and begun our Journey in the common Post-waggon to <HI>Osna∣burg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Osnabrug.</NOTE> where we came the Fourth day following in the Evening.</P>
<P>We past through a very dark Coun∣try to that place, yet I felt not so great a weight and suffering in my Spirit as six Years ago, when I went through the same places.</P>
<P>At <HI>Osnabrug</HI> we had a little time with the Man of the Inn, where we lay, and left him several good Books
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>
of Friends in the Low and High <HI>Dutch</HI> Tongues to Read and to dispose of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19th. 6 Month. Herwer∣den.</NOTE>The next morning (being the fifth day of the Week) we set forward to <HI>Herwerden,</HI> and came thither at Night. This is the City where the Princess <HI>Elizabeth Palatine</HI> hath her Court, whom and the Countess in Company with her, it was especially upon us to Visit, and that upon several Ac∣compts.</P>
<P N="1">1. In that they are Persons seeking after the best things.</P>
<P N="2">2. That they are actually Lovers and Favourers of those that separate themselves from the World for the sake of Righteousness.</P>
<P>For the Princess is not only a pri∣vate supporter of such, but gave pro∣tection to <HI>De Labadie</HI> himself and his Company, yea when they went under the reproachfull Name of <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> about seven Years since.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="22"/>This Man was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> that dis∣satisfied with the loosness and dead∣ness of the <HI>French</HI> Protestants, even at <HI>Geneva</HI> it self, left them and came for <HI>Holland,</HI> and so vehemently de∣claimed against the Apostacy of the Priests and People there, that the Clergy were inraged and stir'd up the Magistrates against him; and the ra∣ther because many followed him, and several Women of great Quality: Up∣on this the Princess giveth them an in∣vitation, and they came and were pro∣tected by her, but since some miscar∣riages falling out in that place, she thereupon in good measure withdrew her Favour from them, and they re∣moved into another place.</P>
<P>I was moved to Visit this Man and his Company six years ago, and did see him and his two great Disciples, but they would not suffer me to see the People which I laboured for; I in that day saw the airiness and unstableness of the Man's Spirit, and that a Sect-master was his Name, and it was upon me both by Word of Mouth and Writing
<PB N="34" REF="23"/>
to let them know, that the Enemy would prevail against them to draw them into inconvenient things, if they came not to be stay'd in the Light of Jesus Christ, and to know the Holy Silence, and that at last they would come to fall out one with another and moulder away; which is in some mea∣sure come to pass as I fear'd; for I clear∣ly perceived, that though they had re∣ceived some Divine Touches, a danger there was they would run out with them, and spend them like Prodigals, not knowing then where to stay their Minds for daily Bread; yea though they were something Angelical and like to the Celestial Bodies, yet if they kept not their Station, they would prove fallen Stars; they moved not in the motion of him that had vi∣sited them, but were fill'd with gross Mixtures, and thereby brought forth mixt Births: That is to say, things not Natural but Monstrous. In fine they were Shy of us, they knew us not; yet I believed well of some of the People, for a good thing was stirring
<PB N="35" REF="23"/>
in them, and in this Case was the Countess commendable, in that she left all to have joined with a People, that had a pretence at least to more Spirituality and Self-denial than was found in the National Religion she was bred up in; for God had reacht her as she told me about Nine Years ago, and that by an extraordinary way. Now it seemed great pity to us, that Persons of their Quality in the World, should so willingly expose themselves for the false <HI>Quaker,</HI> the reprobate <HI>Sil∣ver,</HI> the <HI>Mixtures,</HI> and that they should not be acquainted with the Life and Testimony of the true <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>Now about a Year▪ since, <HI>R.B.</HI> and <HI>B.F.</HI> took that City in the way from <HI>Frederickstadt</HI> to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and gave them a Visit, in which they informed them somewhat of Friends Principles, and recommended the Testimony of Truth to them, as both a nearer and more certain thing than the utmost of <HI>De Labadie</HI>'s Doctrine. They left tender and loving.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="24"/>Soon after this <HI>Getrueydt Dircks</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth Hendricks</HI> from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> visited them, and obtained a Meeting with them, improving that little, way God by his Providence had made more closely to press the Testimony, and though they, especially the Countess, made some Objections, in relation to the Ordinances and certain Practices of Friends, yet she seemed to receive at that time satisfaction from them. These Visits have occasioned a Corre∣spondence by way of Letter betwixt them and several of us, wherein the Mistery of Truth hath been more clear∣ly opened to their Understandings, and they have been brought nearer into a waiting Frame by those Heavenly Di∣rections they have frequently receiv'd by way of Epistles from several of us.</P>
<P>This Digression from the present History, I thought not altogether un∣nessary or unpleasing.</P>
<P>But to Return, being arrived at that City, part of which is under her Go∣vernment, we gave her to understand it, desiring to know what time next
<PB N="37" REF="24"/>
day would be most proper for us to Vi∣sit her. She sent us word, she was glad that we were come, and should be rea∣dy to receive us the next Morning a∣bout the Seventh Hour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th./20th. 6 Month.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next morning being come (which was the sixth day of the week) we went about the time she had ap∣pointed us, and found both her and the Countess ready to receive us, which they did with a more than ordinary Expression of Kindness. I can truly say it, and that in God's fear, I was ve∣ry deeply and reverently affected with the Sense that was upon my Spirit, of the great and notable day of the Lord, and the breakings in of his Eternal Power upon all Nations, and of the raising of the slain Witness to judge the World, who is the Treasure of Life and Peace, of Wisdom and Glory to all that re∣ceive him in the Hour of his Judgments and abide with him. The Sense of this deep and sure Foundation which God is laying, as the Hope of Eternal Life and Glory for all to Build upon, fill'd my Soul with an Holy Testimony
<PB N="38" REF="25"/>
to them, which in a living Sense was followed by my Brethren, and so the Meeting ended about the Eleventh Hour.</P>
<P>The Princess intreated us to stay and Dine with her, but with due regard both to our Testimony and to her at that time we refused it; desiring if she pleased another opportunity that day, which she with all chearfulness yielded to; She her self appointing the Second Hour. So we went to our Quarters, and some time after we had Dined we returned. The Meeting soon began, there were several present besides the Princess and Countess; it was at this Meeting that the Lord in a more emi∣nent manner began to appear, the E∣ternal Word shewed it self a Hammer at this day, yea sharper than a two edged Sword dividing asunder be∣tween the Soul and the Spirit, the Joints and the Marrow; yea this day was all Flesh Humbled before the Lord; it amazed one, struck another, broke another, yea, the noble Arm of the Lord was truly awakened, and the
<PB N="39" REF="25"/>
weight and work thereof bowed and tendered us also after an unusual and extraordinary manner, that the Lord might work an Heavenly Sign before them and among them, that the Maje∣sty of him that is risen among the poor <HI>Quakers</HI> might in some measure be known unto them, what God it is we serve, and what Power it is we wait for and bow before, yea they had a Sense and Discovery that day what would become of the Glory of all Flesh, when God shall enter into Judgment. Well, let my right hand forget its Cunning, and my Tongue cleave to the roof of my Mouth, when I shall forget the loving kindness of the Lord, and the sure Mercies of our God to us his Tra∣velling Servants that day. O Lord, send forth thy Light and thy Truth, that all Nations may behold thy Glo∣ry. Thus continued the Meeting till about the Seventh Hour, which done, with Hearts and Souls filled with Holy Thanksgivings to the Lord for his abun∣dant Mercy and Goodness to us, we departed to our Lodging; desiring to
<PB N="40" REF="26"/>
know whether our coming the next day might not be uneasie or unseason∣able to her with respect to the Affairs of her Government, it being the last day of the Week, when we were in∣formed she was most frequently atten∣ded with Addresses from her Peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but with a loving and ready Mind she replyed, <HI>That she should be glad to see us the next Morning, and at any time when we would.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">11th./12th. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Month.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next Morning (being the Se∣venth day) we were there betwixt Eight and Nine, where <HI>R.B.</HI> falling into some discourse with the Princess, the Countess took hold of the Oppor∣tunity, and Whispered me to with∣draw to get a Meeting for the more inferiour Servants of the House, who would have been Bashful to have pre∣sented themselves before the Princess; and blessed be the Lord, he was not wanting to us, but the same blessed Power that had appeared to Visit them of High, appeared also to Visit them of Low Degree, and we were all sweetly tender'd and broken toge∣ther,
<PB N="41" REF="26"/>
for Vertue went forth of Jesus that Day, and the Life of our God was shed abroad amongst us as a sweet savour, for which their Souls bowed before the Lord, and confess'd to our Testimony, which did not a little please that Noble Young Woman, to find her own report of us, and her great care of them so effectually an∣swered. Oh, what shall we say, is there any God like our God? Who is glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, working Wonders! To his Eternal Name, Power and Arm be the Glory for Ever.</P>
<P>The Meeting done, the Princess came to us expressing much Satisfacti∣on, that we had that good opportuni∣ty with her Servants, telling us she much desired they should have a true and right Character of us, and that therefore she chose to with-draw, that they might have freer access, and that it might look like their own Act, on Words to that Purpose. The Twelfth Hour being come we returned to our Inn, letting them understand, we pur∣posed
<PB N="42" REF="27"/>
(the Lord willing) to Visit them some time that Afternoon.</P>
<P>I must not here forget, that we found at our Inn the first Night at Supper, a Young Merchant of a sweet and ingenious Temper, belonging to the City of <HI>Bremen,</HI> who took occasi∣on from that Night's Discourse, the sixth day at Dinner and Supper, and the Seventh day also, to seek all oppor∣tunities of conference with us, and (as we have reason to be believe) he stay∣ed Twenty Four Hours in that City on our Account. We opened to him the Testimony of Truth; I know not that in any one thing he contradicted us. At last he plainly discovered himself unto us to be a Follower of a certain Minister in <HI>Bremen,</HI> that is even by his Fellow-ministers and Protestants re∣proached with the Name of <HI>Quaker,</HI> because of his singular sharpness against the formal lifeless Ministers and Chri∣stians in the World. We laid fast hold upon this, and askt him, in case any of us should Visit that City, if he would give us the opportunity of a
<PB N="43" REF="27"/>
Meeting at his House? which he rea∣dily granted us: So we gave him some Books, recommending him to the true and blessed Testimony of Christ Jesus the Light and Judge of the World, and Life of them that receive him and be∣lieve in him, and so we parted.</P>
<P>It being now about Three in the Afternoon we went to the Princess's, where being come, after some little time, the Princess and Countess put me in Remembrance of a Promise I made them in one of my Letters out of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> namely, that I would give them an account (at some convenient time) of my first Convincement, and of those Tribulations and Consolations which I had met withal in this way of the Kingdom, which God hath brought me to. After some pause I found my self very free and prepared in the Lord's love and fear to comply with their re∣quest, and so after some Silence, began: But before I had half done, it was Sup∣per time, and the Princess would by no means let us go, we must Sup with her, which importunity not being well able
<PB N="44" REF="28"/>
to avoid, we yielded to, and sat down &amp; her to Supper; among the rest, present at these Opportunities, it must not be for∣gotten, that there was a Countess, Si∣ster to the Countess, then come in to Vi∣sit her, and a <HI>French</HI> Woman of Qua∣lity, the first behaving her self very decently, and the last often deeply broken, and from a light and slighting Carriage towards the very Name of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> she became very intimately and affectionately kind and respectful to us. Supper being ended, we all returned to the Princess's Chamber, where making us all to sit down with her, she with both the Countesses and the <HI>French</HI> Woman prest from me the Continuance of my Relation, but none more than the Countess'<HI>s</HI> Sister, which (tho' late) I was not unwilling to oblige them with, because I knew not when the Lord would give me such an opportunity, and I found them affected. It continued till about Ten at Night, yet many particulars omit∣ted, partly through forgetfulness, and partly for want of time; howbeit, I
<PB N="45" REF="28"/>
must needs say, they heard me with an Earnest and Tender Attention, and I hope and believe the Lord hath made it profitable unto them.</P>
<P>This done, some discourse they had upon it, and afterwards we spoke a∣bout a Meeting for the next day, being the first day of the Week, and that we might have not only as many of her own Family, but as many of her Town as would willingly be there, she yielded to it, and appointed the Meeting to begin at the Second Hour, so we parted being near the Eleventh Hour at Night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th./22th. 6 Month.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next Morning we had a Meet∣ing among our selves in our Chamber, wherein the Lord refresht us, and there was a great Travail upon our Spi∣rits, that the Lord would stand by us that day and magnifie the Testimony of his own Truth by us, that he might have a Seed and People in that place to lift up a Standard for his Name.</P>
<P>At Dinner there were several Stran∣gers that came by the Post-Waggon that day, among whom there was a
<PB N="46" REF="29"/>
Young Man of <HI>Bremen,</HI> being a Stu∣dent of <HI>Duysburgh,</HI> who informed us of a sober and seeking Man of great Note in that City of <HI>Duysburgh</HI>; to him we gave some Books. There was one more who was tender and inquiring, to whom also we gave some Books.</P>
<P>The Second Hour being at Hand we went to the Meeting, where were se∣veral as well of the Town as of the Fa∣mily; the Meeting began with a weighty Exercise and Travel in Pray∣er, that the Lord would glorifie his own Name that day, and by his own power he made way to their Consci∣ences, and sounded his wakening Trumpet in their Ears, that they might know that he was God, and that there is none like unto him. Oh, the day of the Lord livingly dawned upon us, and the searching Life of Jesus was in the midst of us! Oh! the word that ne∣ver faileth them that wait for it, and abide in it, opened the way and un∣sealed the Book of Life, yea the quick∣ning Power and Life of Jesus wrought and reacht to them, and vertue from

him in whom dwelleth the God-head bodily, went forth, and blessedly distill∣ed upon us his own Heavenly Life, sweeter than the Spices with pure Frankincense, yea than the sweet smelling Myrrh that cometh from a far Country, and as it began, so it was carried on, and so it ended; Blessed be the Name of the Lord, and confided in be our God for ever. Assoon as the Meet∣ing was done, the Princess came to me and took me by the hand (which she usually did to us all coming and going) and went to speak to me of the Sense she had of that Power and Presence of God, that was amongst us, but was stopt, and turning her self to the Win∣dow brake forth in an extraordinary Passion, crying out, I cannot Speak to you, my Heart is full, claping her Hands upon her Breast; it melted me into a deep and calm tenderness, in which I was moved to Minister a few words softly to her, and after some time of Silence, she recovered her self, and as I was taking my leave of her, she interrupted me thus, Will ye not come
<PB N="48" REF="30"/>
hither again? Pray call here as ye re∣turn out of <HI>Germany</HI>: I told her we were in the Hand of the Lord, and be∣ing his, could not dispose of our selves; but the Lord had taken care, that we should not forget her and those with her, for he had raised and begotten an Heavenly Concernment in our Souls for her and them, and that we loved them all with that love wherewith God had loved u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with much more to that purpose. She then turned to the rest of the Friends, and would have had us all gone down to Supper with her, but we chose rather to be excused; we should Eat a bit of her Bread and Drink a glass of her Wine if she pleas∣ed in the Chamber where we were. At last we prevailed with her to leave us. The Countess, the <HI>French</HI> Wo∣man, and the Countess's waiting Woman stay'd with us, and we had a very retir'd and seasonable Opportu∣nity with them. After the Princess had Supt, we went all down and took our Solemn leave of her, the Countess, her Sister, the <HI>French</HI> Woman, with
<PB N="49" REF="30"/>
the rest of the Family, whose hearts were reach'd and opened by our Testi∣monies; recommending unto them Holy Silence from all Will-worship, and the Workings, Strivings and Images of their own Mind and Spirit, that Jesus might be felt of them in their Hearts, his holy Teachings witnessed, and fol∣lowed in the way of his Blessed Cross that would crucifie them unto the World, and the World unto them; that their Faith, Hope and Joy might stand in Christs in them the Heavenly Prophet, Shepherd and Bishop, whose voice all that are truly Sheep will hear and follow, and not the voice of any stranger whatever. So we left them in the Love and Peace of God, praying that they might be kept from the Evil of this World. So we returned to our Lodging, having our Hearts filled with a weighty Sense of the Lord's appear∣ance with us in that place, and being late (towards the Ninth Hour) we prepared to go to Rest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th./23th. 6 Month.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next Morning (being the Se∣cond day of the Week) <HI>G.K. B.F.</HI>

and my self got ready to begin our Jour∣ney towards <HI>Franckfort,</HI> w<SUP>c•</SUP> by the way of <HI>Cassel</HI> is about 200 <HI>English</HI> Miles. <HI>R.

The Lord moved me to call upon his great Name, that he would be with them that stayed, and with them that returned also, and with us that went forward in wild and untrodden places, and his blessed Love and Life over-shadowed us, yea he filled our Cup together, and made us drink into one Spirit, even the Cup of Blessings in the Fellowship of the everlasting Seed, in which we took leave of one ano∣ther, and after having Eaten, it be∣ing about the Seventh Hour, we de∣parted the City.</P>
<P>We came to <HI>Paderborn</HI> that Night, six <HI>German</HI> Miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pader∣borne.</NOTE> which are about thirty six <HI>English,</HI> it is a dark Popish Town, and under the Government of
<PB N="51" REF="31"/>
a Bishop of that Religion; howbeit, the Woman where we lodged was an Ancient, Grave and Serious Person, to whom we declared the Testimony of the Light, shewing her the difference betwixt an outside and an inside Reli∣gion, which she received with much kindness. We left some Books with her, which she took readily.</P>
<P>There was also with us at Supper a <HI>Lutheran</HI> that was a Lawyer, with whom I had very good Service in o∣pening to him the great loss of the power of Godliness, as well among them who separated from <HI>Rome,</HI> as in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church: which he confes∣sed: I directed him to the Principle of Light in his Conscience, that let him see the lifeless State of the false Christians; and if he turned his mind to that Prin∣ciple and waited there for Power, he would receive Power to Rule and Go∣vern himself according to true Godli∣ness, and that it was the loss of <HI>Christen∣dom</HI> that they went from this Principle, in which the Power standeth, that con∣formeth the Soul into the Image and

Likeness of the dear Son of God, and thither they must come again, if ever they will have the true knowledge of God, and enjoy Life and Salvation; with much more to that purpose, all which he received lovingly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14th./24th. 6 Month.</NOTE>The next Morning we set forwards toward <HI>Cassel,</HI> but through great foul∣ness of Weather, having only naked Carts to Ride in, the Waters being al∣so High with the Rains: We got not to <HI>Cassel</HI> till the next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th./25th. Cassel.</NOTE> which was the Fourth day of the Week. It being late we made little inquiry that Night, be∣ing also wearied with the foulness of the Ways and Weather.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th./26th.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the next day we made our usual Inquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> who was worthy in the City, and found some that tenderly and lovingly received us, to whom we declared the Visitation of the Light and Love of God. Among the rest was <HI>Dureus</HI> our Countryman, a Man of Seventy Seven Years of Age, who had learned in good Measure to for∣get his Learning, School Divinity, and Priest's Craft, and for his approaches

<P>Upon the Sixth day of the same week about Noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th./27th. 6 Month.</NOTE> we set out towards <HI>Franckfort,</HI> having left several Books behind us, which hath been our Pra∣ctice in our Journey.</P>
<P>At <HI>Franckfort</HI> we Arrived the Se∣cond day about Noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frank∣fort.</NOTE> being just a Week from <HI>Herwerden,</HI> and having from thence and <HI>Cassel</HI> made known our intentions of coming to that City, two considerable Persons came and met us about half a <HI>German</HI> Mile from the City, informing us of several well af∣fected in that Town; upon which we told them the end of our coming, and desired to have a Meeting with them in the Afternoon, which we easily ob∣tained at the House of a Merchant, one of the two that met us. The persons
<PB N="54" REF="33"/>
that resorted thither were generally People of considerable Note, both of <HI>Calvinists</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and we can say, they received us with gladness of Heart, and embraced our Testimony with a broken and reverent Spirit, thanking God for our coming amongst them, and praying that he would pro∣sper this work in our Hands; this in∣gaged our hearts to make some longer stay in this City.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21st./31st. 6 Month.</NOTE>We therefore desired another Meet∣ing the next day, which they cheer∣fully assented to, where several came that were not with us the day before, and the Lord that sent us into the Land was with us, and by his Power reached to them, insomuch that they confessed to the Truth of our Testimony. Of these Persons there were two Women, one a Virgin, the other a Widow, both Noble of Birth, who had a deep Sense of that power and presence of God that accompanied our Testimony, and their hearts yearned strongly towards us;<NOTE PLACE="marg">22/1 6 Mon.</NOTE> the Virgin giving us a particular invitation to her House the next Morn∣ing,
<PB N="55" REF="33"/>
where we had the most blessed Opportunity of the three, for the Lord's power so eminently appeared, that not only those that had been with us before were most effectually reacht, but a certain Student residing in the House of a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Minister (sent for by that Young Woman) was bro∣ken to pieces, and magnified that bles∣sed power which appeared. Also there accidentally came in a Doctor of <HI>Phy∣sick,</HI> who unexpectedly was affected, and confessed to the Truth, praying God to prosper us. This was the bles∣sed Issue of our Visit to <HI>Franckfort.</HI></P>
<P>But there is one thing more not un∣fit to be mentioned. Among some of those that have Inclinations after God, a fearful Spirit together with the shame of the Cross hath entred, against which our Testimony in part striking, we took Notice it was as Life to these no∣ble Women, for that was it as they told us, which had long opprest them, and obstructed the work of the Lord amongst them. Therefore said the Young Virginour, Quarters are free for

you, let all come that will come, and lift up your Voices without fear, for (said she) it will never be well with us till Persecution come, and some of us be lodged in the <HI>Stadthouse,</HI> that is the Prison. We left the Peace of Je∣sus with them, and the same After∣noon we departed out of that City, being the fourth day of the week.</P>

<P><PB N="65" REF="38"/>And, <HI>Friends,</HI> let it never pass out of our remembrance, <HI>what our God hath done for us, since he hath made us a People:</HI> Hath any Weapon formed against us, prospered? hath he cal∣led us, and not protected us? hath he given Power to conceive, and not to bring forth? hath he not sheltered us in many a Storm? did he ever leave us under the Reproaches and Contradictions of Men? nay, hath he not spoken <HI>Peace</HI> to us? were we ever cast out by Men, and he forsook us? No, the Lord hath taken us up: Were we ever in Prison, and he visi∣ted us not? hungry, and he fed us not? naked, and he clothed us not? or have we been sick, and he came not to see us? When were the Jails so close, that he could not come in? and the Dungeons so dark, that he caused not his Light to shine upon us? O nay; he hath never left us, nor forsaken us; yea, he hath pro∣vided richly for us; he hath brought us into the Wilderness, not to starve us, but to try us; yet not above our
<PB N="66" REF="39"/>
measure: For he fed us with Manna from on high, with pure Honey and Water out of the Rock, and gave his good Spirit to sustain us: By Night he was a Pillar of Fire to us, to comfort us; and by Day a Pillar of Cloud, to hide and shelter us. He was a Shadow of a mighty Rock, that followed us; and we never wan∣ted a Brook by the way to refresh us. Was God good to <HI>Israel</HI> outward? Much more hath he abounded to his spiritual <HI>Israel,</HI> the proper Seed and Off-spring of himself. O the noble Deeds and valiant Acts that he hath wrought in our Day for our Delive∣rance! He hath caused One to chase Ten, and Ten an Hundred, and an Hundred a Thousand many a Time. None hath been able to snatch us out of his Hands, who abode in his Truth. For though the Winds have blown, and the Sea hath raged, yet hath he rebuked the Winds and the Sea for his Seed's sake: He hath said to the Winds, <HI>Be still</HI>; and to the Sea, <HI>Thus far shalt thou come, and
<PB N="67" REF="39"/>
no further.</HI> He hath cast up a high Way for his Ransomed to walk in, so plain, that though a Fool he shall not err therein. This is the Light, in which all Nations of them that are saved must walk for ever.</P>
<P>And therefore, <HI>Friends,</HI> let us stay our Minds in the Light of the Lord for ever; and let the Awe, Fear and Dread of the Almighty dwell in us; and let his Holy Spirit be known to be a Covering to us, that from the Spirit of this World we may be chast∣ly kept and preserved unto God, in the holy Light and Self-denying Life of Jesus, who hath offered up him∣self once for all, leaving us an Ex∣ample that we should also follow his Steps; that as he our dear Lord and Master, so we his Servants, and Friends, and Children, might by the eternal Spirit offer up our selves to God in Body, in Soul and in Spirit, which are his; that we may be his Workmanship, created in Christ Je∣sus unto good Works, to the Praise of him that hath called us; which
<PB N="68" REF="40"/>
Calling is an high and an holy Cal∣ling, by the eternal Light and Spirit in our Consciences. O that it might for ever remain in high Estimation with us; and that it may be the daily Watch and Travel of us all, in the Presence of the Holy and Living God, that hath called us, to make our great Call and Election sure, which many have neglected to do, (who have been convinced by the blessed Light and Truth of Christ Jesus revealed in their Hearts, and who for a time have walked among us) have been overcome by the Spirit of this World, and turned their Hands from the Plough, and deserted the Camp of the Lord, and gone back into <HI>Egypt</HI> again, whereby the Hea∣thens have blasphemed, and the Way and People of the Lord greatly have suffered.</P>
<P>Therefore, O my dear Friends and Brethren, in the Sense of that Life and Power, that God from Heaven so gloriously hath dispensed among us, and by which he hath given us
<PB N="69" REF="40"/>
multiplied Assurances of his Loving-kindness unto us, and crowned us together with heavenly Dominion, and in which my Spirit is at this time broken before the Lord, do I most earnestly entreat you to watch continually, lest any of you, that have tasted of the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come, fall by Temptation; and by Carelesness and Neglect tempt the living God to withdraw his fatherly Visitation from any of you; and fi∣nally to desert such: for the Lord our God is a jealous God, and he will not give his Glory unto another. He hath given to Man all but Man himself, and him he hath reserved for his own peculiar Service, to build him up a glorious Temple to him∣self; so that we are bought with a Price, and we are not our own.</P>
<P>Therefore let us continually watch, and stand in awe, that we grieve not his Holy Spirit, nor turn his Grace into Wantonness: But all of us let us wait, and that in a holy travail of
<PB N="70" REF="41"/>
Spirit, to know our selves sealed by the Spirit of Adoption, unto the Day of our compleat Redemption; when not only all our Sins, but all Sorrows, Sighings and Tears shall be wiped a∣way from our Eyes; and everlasting Songs of Joy and Thanksgivings shall melodiously fill our Hearts to God, that sits upon the Throne, and to his blessed immaculate Lamb, who by his most precious Blood shall have compleatly redeemed us from the Earth, and written our Names in the Book of Life.</P>
<P><HI>Friends,</HI> The Spirit of the Lord hath often brought you into my Re∣membrance, since I have been in this desolate Land, and with Joy unutte∣rable have I had sweet and precious Fellowship with you in the Faith of Jesus, that overcometh the World: For, though absent in Body, yet pre∣sent in him that is Omnipresent. And I can truly say, you are very near and very dear unto me; and the Love that God hath raised in my Heart un∣to you, surpasses the Love of Women.
<PB N="71" REF="41"/>
And our Testimony, I am well satis∣fied, is sealed up together. And I am well assured, that all that love the <HI>Light</HI> shall endure to the End through∣out all Tribulations, and in the End obtain Eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Friends,</HI> as I have been travelling in this dark and solitary Land, the great Work of the Lord in the Earth has been often presented unto my view, and the Day of the Lord hath been deeply upon me, and my Soul and Spirit hath frequently been possessed with an holy and weighty Concern for the Glory of the Name of the Lord, and the spreading of his everlasting Truth, and the Prosperity of it through all Nations, that the very Ends of the Earth may look to him, and may know Christ the Light to be given to them for their Salvation: And when the Sense of these things hath been deeply upon me, an holy and strong Cry God hath raised in my Soul to him, <HI>That we, who have known this fatherly Visitation from on High,
<PB N="72" REF="42"/>
and who have beheld the Day of the Lord, the Rising of the Sun of Righ∣teousness, who is full of Grace and full of Truth, and have beheld his Glory, and confessed it to be the Glory of the only begotten Son of God▪ and who by Obedience to his appearance are become the Children of Light, and of the Day, and as the First-Fruits to God after this long Night of Apostacy, might for ever walk and dwell in his holy Covenant, Christ Jesus, the Light of the World; because in him we have always Peace, but out of him comes all the Trouble.</HI></P>
<P>And whilst this heavenly Sense rested with me, the <HI>Lord God,</HI> that made me, and called me by his Grace unto Salvation, laid it upon me, to visit you in an holy Exhortation. And it is the Exhortation of my Life at this time, in the earnest and fer∣vent Motion of the Power and Spirit of Jesus, to beseech you all, who are turned to the Light of Christ, that shineth in your Hearts, and be∣lieve in it, That you carefully and faithfully walk in it, in the same
<PB N="73" REF="42"/>
Dread, Awe and Fear, in which you began; that that holy Poverty of Spirit, that is precious in the Eyes of the Lord, and was in the Days of your first Love, may dwell and rest with you; that you may daily feel the same heavenly Hunger and Thirst, the same Lowliness and Humility of Mind, the same Zeal and Tender∣ness, and the same Sincerity and Love unfeigned; that God may fill you out of his heavenly Treasure with the Riches of Life, and crown you with holy Victory and Dominion over the God and Spirit of this World: That your <HI>Alpha</HI> may be your <HI>Omega,</HI> and your <HI>Author</HI> your <HI>Finisher,</HI> and your <HI>first Love</HI> your <HI>last Love</HI>; that so none may make Shipwrack of Faith, and of a good Conscience, nor faint by the Way. And as in this State we are kept in holy Watchfulness to God, as in the beginning, the Table which our heavenly Father spreads, and the Blessings with which he com∣passeth us about, shall not become a Snare unto us, nor shall we turn the
<PB N="74" REF="43"/>
<HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Mercies</HI> of the Lord into Wantonness; but we shall eat and drink in an holy Fear, apparel our selves in Fear, buy and sell in Fear, visit one another in Fear; keep Meet∣ings, and there wait upon the Lord in Fear: yea, whatsoever we take in hand to do, it shall be in the holy Fear of God, and with an holy Ten∣derness of his Glory, and Regard to the Prosperity of his Truth: yea, we shall deny our selves not only in the unlawful things, but in the things that are even lawful to us, for the Sake of the many Millions that are unconverted to God.</P>
<P>For my Friends and Brethren, God hath laid upon us (whom he hath honoured with the beginning of his great Work in the World) the Care both of this Age, and of the Ages to come; that they may walk, as they have us for Examples: yea, the Lord God hath chosen you to place his Name in you; the Lord hath en∣trusted you with his Glory, that you might hold it forth to all Nations;
<PB N="75" REF="43"/>
and that the Generations unborn may call you Blessed.</P>
<P>Therefore, let none be Treache∣rous to the Lord, nor reward him Evil for Good; nor betray his Cause directly by wilful Wickedness, nor indirectly by Negligence and Un∣faithfulness: But be zealous and va∣liant for Truth on Earth; let none be slothful or careless: O remember the slothful Servant's State. And let the loving-kindness of the Lord over∣come every Soul to Faithfulness; For with him are Riches and Honour, and every good thing: And whither should any go? he hath the words of Eternal Life. O, let none loose their Testimony, but hold it up for God; let thy Gift be never so small, thy Testimony never so little. Through thy whole Conversation bear it for God; and be true to what thou art convinced of: And wait all upon the Lord, that you may grow in your heavenly Testimony; that Life may fill your Hearts, your Houses, and your Meetings; that you may daily
<PB N="76" REF="44"/>
wait to know, and to receive Power to do the Will of God on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</P>
<P>And O! that the Cross of Jesus, may be in high and honourable Esteem with every one; that the Liberty of all may stand in the Cross, which alone preserveth: for it is the Power of God, that crucifieth us to the World, and the World to us. And through Death, way is made un∣to Life and Immortality; which by this blessed Cross, the Gospel, the Power is brought to Light: So shall the Seed of Life that God hath sown in our Hearts, grow; and in that Seed shall we all come to be Blessed, unto whom God hath appointed the Dominion over us: and it is good for all to live under the Holy Govern∣ment of it; for the Ways of it are the Ways of Pleasantness, and all its Paths are Peace; and all that are born of it, can say, <HI>Thy Scepter is a Scepter of Righteousness.</HI> And O! That all Friends every where, may continu∣ally bow unto his righteous Scepter,
<PB N="77" REF="44"/>
and keep to his holy Law, which is written in their Hearts; that it may be a Light to their Feet, and a Lan∣thorn to their Paths. So shall they come to witness that holy Promise made good unto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 59.21.</NOTE> <HI>That the Spi∣rit, which I have given unto him, the Seed; and the Words▪ which I have put into his Mouth, shall not depart from him, nor from his Seed, nor from his Seed's Seed unto all Generations.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, Friends, redeem the Time, because the Days are Evil; God hath given you to see they are so: and be ye separated more and more, yea, perfectly disentangled from the Cares of this World. And be ye not cumbred with the many things; but stand loose from the things that are seen, which are Tem∣poral.</P>
<P>And you that are Poor murmur not; but be Patient, and trust in the Lord, and submit to his Providence, and he will provide for you, that which is convenient for you, the Days of your appointed Time. And
<PB N="78" REF="45"/>
you that are Rich, keep in the Mo∣deration, and strive not to multiply earthly Treasure, nor to heap up un∣certain Riches to your selves; but what God hath given you more than what is convenient for your own Use, wait for his Wisdom, to em∣ploy it for his Glory; that you may be faithful Stewards of this World's Mammon; and the Lord God shall reward you into your Bosoms, of the Riches of that Kingdom that shall never have an End.</P>
<P>O my Friends and Brethren, whe∣ther Rich or Poor, in Bonds or at Liberty, in whatsoever State you are, the Salutation of the universal Life of Jesus is to you. And the Exhortation is, to bow to what is made known unto you; and in the Light, by which ye have received in measure the Knowledg of God, watch and wait diligently to the farther Revelation of the Mind and Will of God unto you, that ye may be endued from on High with Power and Might in your inward Man, to answer the call and
<PB N="79" REF="45"/>
requirings of the Lord; that ye may be enabled to make known to the Nations, what is the Riches of the Glory of this blessed Mystery in the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; which is Christ Jesus the Light of the World, in you the Hope of Glory. For this I have to tell you in the Vision of the Almighty, that the Day of the breaking up of the Nations about you, and of the sounding of the Gospel-Trumpet un∣to the Inhabitants of the Earth, is just at the Door: And they that are worthy, who have kept their Habi∣tation from the beginning, and have dwelt in the Unity of the Faith that overcometh the World, and have kept the Bond of Peace: The Lord God will impower and spirit you to go forth with his Everlasting Word and Testament to <HI>awaken, and gather Kindreds, Languages, and People to the Glory of the rising of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>Light; who is God's Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>And I must tell you, that there is a Breathing, Hungering, Seeking
<PB N="80" REF="46"/>
People, solitarily scattered up and down this great Land of <HI>Germany</HI> where the Lord hath sent me; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believe it is the like in other Nations▪ And as the Lord hath laid it upon me, with my Companions, to see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some of them out, so have we foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> several in divers Places. And w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have had many blessed Opportuni∣ties amongst them, wherein our Hearts have greatly rejoiced; having been made deeply sensible of the Love of God towards them, and of the great openness and tenderness of Spi∣rit in them to receive the Testimony of Light and Life through us. And we have a stedfast belief, that the Lord will carry on his Work in this Land effectually; and that he will raise up those, that shall be as Mi∣nisters of his eternal Testament a∣mongst them. And O! our desire is, that God would put it into the Hearts of many of his faithful Witnesses, to visit the Inhabitants of this Country, where God hath a great Seed of Peo∣ple to be gathered; that his Work
<PB N="81" REF="47"/>
may go on in the Earth, till the whole Earth be filled with his Glo∣ry.</P>
<P>And it is under the deep and weighty Sense of this approaching Work, that the Lord God hath laid it upon me, to write to you to wait for the farther pourings out of the Power and Spirit of the Lord; that nothing that is Careless, Sleepy, Earthly, or Exalted, may get up, whereby to displease the Lord, and cause him to withdraw his sweet and preserving Presence from any that know him. But let all keep the King of Righteousness his Peace, and walk in the Steps of the Flocks of the Com∣panions: For Withering and Destru∣ction shall come upon all such as de∣sert the Camp of the Lord, or with their murmuring Spirit disquiet the Heritage of God; for they are grea∣ter Enemies to <HI>Sion</HI>'s Glory, and <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI>'s Peace, than the open Ar∣mies of the <HI>Aliens.</HI></P>
<P>And it is a Warning to all, that make mention of the Name of the
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>
Lord in this Dispensation he hath brought us to, That they have a care how they let out their Minds in any wise to please the Lusts of the Eye, the Lusts of the Flesh, and the Pride of Life; which are not of the Fa∣ther, but of this World, lest any be exalted in a Liberty, that maketh the Cross of Jesus of none effect, and the Offence thereof to cease: for such will become as Salt that hath lost its Savour, and at last will be trod un∣der the Feet of God and Men. For the Lord will withdraw his daily Presence, and the Fountain will come to be sealed up, and the Well of Sal∣vation be stopped again.</P>
<P>Therefore, as all would rejoice in the Joy of God's Salvation, let them wait for the saving Power, and dwell in it; that, knowing the Mystery of the Work of Regeneration, Christ formed in them the Hope of their Glory, they may be able in the mo∣tion of him, that hath begotten them through Death to Life, to go forth and declare the Way of Life and Sal∣vation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="48"/>And all you, that are young, con∣vinced of the Eternal Truth, come into it, and then you will feel the Virtue of it: And so, you will be Witnesses, otherwise <HI>Vain Talkers, Wells without Water, Clouds without Rain; for which State is reserved the Blackness of Darkness for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Minds, and be sober, and tempt not God; but receive the Day of your Visitation, and walk worthy of so great Love, and delight to retain God in your Knowledg; and grieve not his Holy Spirit, but join to it, and be led by it, that it may be an Earnest to you of an Eternal Inheri∣tance.</P>
<P>And take up your daily Cross and follow Christ, and not the Spirit of this World. He was meek and low∣ly, he was humble and plain; he was few in Words, but mighty in Deeds: He loved not his Life unto Death, even the reproachful Death of the Cross; but laid down his Life, and became of no Reputation, and that
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>
for the Rebellious. <HI>O the Height, and the Depth, the Length, and the Breadth; yea, the Ʋnsearchableness of the Love of God in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, while it is to Day, hear∣ken to his Voice, and harden not your Hearts; and make no Bargains for your Self, neither consult with Flesh and Blood: But let the Lord be your Light, and your Salvation; let him be the Strength of your Life, and the Length of your Days. And this know assuredly, that none ever trust∣ed to the Lord, and were confound∣ed.</P>
<P>Wherefore hold up your Testimo∣ny for God; as ye would enjoy the Increasings of his Life and Love: And let your Light shine, and confess him before the whole World. Smo∣ther not his Appearance, neither hide thy Candle, God hath lighted in thee, under a Bushel; for Christ walketh among his Candlesticks of pure and tried Gold: Wherefore set thy Light upon a Candlestick, and shew forth thy good Conversation in Meekness
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>
and godly Fear, that thou mayest be∣come a good Example; and others beholding thy good Works, may glo∣rify God. But for the Rebellious, the Fearful, and the Unbelieving, the Day hastens upon such, that the things that belong to their Eternal Peace, shall be hid from their Eyes for ever.</P>
<P>And all you my dear Friends and Brethren, who are in Sufferings for the Testimony of Jesus, and a good Conscience; look up to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of your Faith; who for the Joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, and despi∣sed the Shame; and is sat down at the Right Hand of the Father in the heavenly Place: into which, if you faint not, you shall all be received, after the Days of your Pilgrimage shall be at an End; with a <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant.</HI></P>
<P>And though these Afflictions seem not joyous, but grievous for the pre∣sent; yet a far more exceeding weight of Glory stands at the Door.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="50"/>Wherefore count it all Joy, you fall into these Trials, and persevere to the End; knowing that he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry, and that his Reward is with him. Remember the Martyrs of Jesus; that loved not their Lives to the Death for his Name's-sake, that had called them. And Jesus himself, that made a good Confession before <HI>Pon∣tius Pilate</HI>; who hath consecrated through his Blood a new and living Way for all, that come unto God by him, who is made a high Priest, higher than the Heavens, one that can be touched and moved; and is daily touched and moved with our Weakness and Infirmity; that through him we may be made strong in the Lord, and more than Conque∣rors through him that hath loved us.</P>
<P>Wherefore let it not seem, as if some strange thing had happened to you, for all these things are for the Trial of your Faith; which is more precious than the Gold that perisheth. 'Tis the old Quarrel, Children of this
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>
World, against the Children of the Lord; those that are born after the Flesh, warring against those that are born after the Spirit: <HI>Cain</HI> against <HI>Abel,</HI> the Old World against <HI>Noah, Sodomites</HI> against <HI>Lot, Hagar</HI> against <HI>Sarah, Ishmael</HI> against <HI>Isaac, Esau</HI> a∣gainst <HI>Jacob, Egyptians</HI> against <HI>Israe∣lites,</HI> the false Prophets against the true Prophets, as <HI>Isaiah, Jeremiah, &amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> under the Profession of the Letter of the Law against Christ, that came to fulfil the Law, and all his spiritual Followers and Disciples: And all the false Apostate Christians against the true and Spiri∣ritual Christians and Martyrs of Jesus.</P>
<P>So, your Conflict is for the Spiritual Appearance of Christ Jesus against those that profess him in Words, but in Works and Conversations every day deny him; doing Despight to the Spirit of Grace in themselves, and those that are led by it. But though <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> shall gather them∣selves together to lay waste the City
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
of God; yet the Lord hath determi∣ned their Destruction, and he will bring it to pass.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore rejoyce, O thou little Hill of God, and clap thy Hands for Joy; for he that is Faithful and True, Just and Righteous, and able to deliver thee, dwells in the midst of thee: Who will cause thee to grow and increase, till thou becomest a great Mountain, till thou be∣comest the Praise of the whole Earth, and the whole Earth be filled with thy Glory.</HI></P>
<P>And to you all, who are the fol∣lowers of the Lamb of God, who was dead, but is alive, and lives for evermore; who is risen in your Hearts, as a bright shining Light, and is leading you out of the Nature and Spirit of this World, in the Path of Regeneration. I have this to say by way of holy Encouragement un∣to you all; the Lord God Eternal that was, and is, and is to come, hath re∣served for you the Glories of the last Days: and if so be, that the Follow∣ers and Martyrs of Jesus in Ages past,
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>
when the Church was going into the Wilderness, and his Witnesses into Sackcloth, were notwithstanding so Noble and Valiant for the Truth on Earth, that they loved not their Lives unto the Death, and suffered joyfully the Spoiling of their Goods for the Testimony of Jesus, how much more ought you all to be encouraged unto Faithfulness, who are come to the Resurrection of the Day, which shall never more be eclipsed; in which the Bride-groom is to come, to fetch you his Spouse out of the WILDERNESS, to give you Beau∣ty for Ashes, and the Garment of Praise for the <HI>SPIRIT</HI> of <HI>HEA∣VINESS</HI>; who will cover you with his Spirit, and adorn you with his fine Linen, the Righteousness of the Saints. Lean upon his Breast for ever; and know your joyning in an Ever∣lasting Covenant with him, that he may lift up the Light of his Coun∣tenance upon you, and delight to do you Good; that in blessing he may bless you, increase you and multiply

<OPENER><SALUTE>My worthy Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SUCH as I have, such I give unto you, the dear and tender Saluta∣tion of Light, Life, Peace and Sal∣vation, by Jesus Christ the blessed Lamb of God, with the unspeak∣able Joy of which he hath replenish∣ed my Soul at this time, that my Cup overfloweth; which is the Reward of them that chearfully drink his

Cup of Tribulations, that love the Cross, and triumph in all the Shame, Reproaches and Contradictions of the World that do attend it: My God take you by the Hand, and gent∣ly lead you through all the Difficul∣ties of Regeneration; and as you have begun to know and love his sweet and tender Drawings, so resign the whole Conduct of your Lives to him; dispute not away the precious Sense that you have of him, be it as small as a Grain of Mustard-seed, which is the least of all Seeds, there is Power in it (if you do but believe) to remove the greatest Mountains of Opposition. O pretious is this Faith, yea more pretious than the Glory and Honour of this World that perish: It will give Courage, go with Christ before <HI>Caiaphas</HI> and <HI>Pilate</HI>; yea, to bear his Cross without the Camp, and to be crucified with him, know∣ing that the Spirit of God and of Glory shall rest upon them: to the Inheritors of this Faith is reserved the eternal Kingdom of Peace and
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>
Joy in the Holy Ghost. O be you of that little Flock unto whom Jesus said, <HI>Fear not, for it is my Father's good pleasure to give you a Kingdom:</HI> And to be of this Flock, you must become as Sheep; and to be as Sheep, you must become harmless; and to become harmless, you must hear and follow the Lamb of God: as he is that blessed Light which discovereth and condemneth all the unfruitful Works of Darkness, and maketh harmless as a Dove; which word, <HI>All,</HI> leaveth not one Piccadillo or Cir∣cumstance undiscovered or unjudged; and the word <HI>Darkness</HI> taketh in the whole Night of Apostacy; and the word <HI>Ʋnfruitful,</HI> is a plain Judg∣ment against all those dark Works: Wherefore out of them all come, and be you separated, and God will give you a Crown of Life, which shall never fade away.</P>
<P>O! the lowness and meanness of those Spirits that despise or neglect the Joys and Glories of Immortality, for the sake of the things which are
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een that are but Temporal, debasing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Nobility of their Souls, aban∣doning the Government of the Di∣vine Spirit, and embracing with all ardency of Affection the sensual Plea∣sures of this Life; but such as perse∣vere therein, shall not enter into God's Rest for ever. But this is not all that hindereth and obstructeth in the ho∣ly Way of Blessedness; for there is the World's Fear as well as the World's Joy that obstructeth many, or else Christ had not said, <HI>Fear not,</HI> to his little Flock. The Shame of the Cross is a Yoke too uneasy, and a Burden too heavy for Flesh and Blood to bear, 'tis true; but therefore shall Flesh and Blood never enter into the Kingdom of God. And not to them that are born of the Flesh, but to those that are born of the Spirit through the Word of Regeneration, is appointed the Kingdom, and that Throne which shall judg the twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> and all the World. The Lord perfect what he hath be∣gun in you, and give you Dominion

over the Love and Fear of this World▪ And, my Friends, if you would pro∣fit in the Way of God, despise no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Day of small things in you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves: Know this, that to desire an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sincerely to breathe after the Lord, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a blessed State; you must seek befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you find. Do you believe? make no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> haste, extinguish not those small Be∣ginnings by an over-earnest or impa∣tient desire of Victory. God's time is the best time; be you faithful, and your Conflict shall end with Glory to God, and the Reward of Peace to your own Souls. Therefore love the Judgment, and love the Fire; start not aside, neither flinch from the scorchings of it, for it will purify and refine you as Gold seven times tried; then cometh the Stamp and Seal of the Lord upon his own Ves∣sel, <HI>Holiness to him for ever</HI>; which he never gave nor will give to repro∣bate Silver, the state of the Religi∣ous Worshippers of the World. And herein be comforted, that <HI>Sion</HI> shall be redeemed through Judgment, and
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>
her Converts through Righteousness; and after the appointed time of Mourning is over, the Lord will give Beauty for Ashes, the Oil of Joy for Mourning, and the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness: then shall you be able to say, Who is he that condemneth us? God hath justified us; there is no Condemna∣tion to us that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit. Wherefore, my dear Friends, walk not only not after the fleshly Lusts, but also not after the fleshly Religions and Worships of the World: for that that is not born of the Spirit, is Flesh; and all Flesh shall wither as the Grass, and the Beauty of it shall fade away as the Flower of the Field before God's Sun that is risen and rising; but the Word of the Lord in which is Life, and that Life the Light of Men, shall endure for ever, and give Life Eternal to them that love and walk in the Light. And I entreat you, by the Love you have for Jesus, have a care how you
<PB N="98" REF="56"/>
touch with fleshly Births, or say <HI>Amen,</HI> by Word or Practice, to that which is not born of the Spirit: for God is not to be found of that, in your selves or others, that calleth him Fa∣ther, and he hath never begotten it in them; that Latitude and Confor∣mity is not of God, but secretly grieveth his Spirit, and obstructeth the growth of the Soul in its Ac∣quaintance and intimate Communi∣on with the Lord. <HI>Without me,</HI> saith Jesus, <HI>you can do nothing; and all that came before me are Thieves and Robbers:</HI> If so, O what are they that Pray, Preach and Sing without Je∣sus, and follow not him in those Du∣ties, but even in them crucify him? O that I may find in you an Ear to hear, and an Heart to perceive and embrace these Truths of Jesus. And I can say, I have great cause to hope, and patiently to wait till the Salva∣tion of God be further revealed to you, and the whole Family; with whom (I must acknowledg) I was abundantly refreshed and comforted,
<PB N="99" REF="56"/>
in that God in measure made known the Riches of his Grace, and Opera∣tion of his Celestial Power to you; and his Witness shall dwell with you, (if we never see you more) that God magnified his own Strength in our Weakness. With him we leave our Travels, affectionately re∣commending you to his holy Spirit of Grace, that you may be con∣formed to the Image of his own dear Son, who is able and ready to pre∣serve you: O stay your Minds upon him, and he will keep you in per∣fect Peace, and abide with you for ever.

<HEAD>To the Prince Elector Palatine <HI>of</HI> Heydelbergh.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Great Prince,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would seem strange that I, both a Stranger and a Subject, should use this freedom of Address to a Prince, were he not one whose Actions shew him to be of a free Disposition and easy Access to all; would to God all Princes were of that mind: But I have not chosen this way of Application, I am dri∣ven to it by the disappointment thy absence from this Court gave me, and the necessity I am under to expe∣dite my Return. And though I can∣not so fully, and consequently not so clearly, express by Letter the Grounds inducing me to attempt this Visit; yet this being all the way that is left me, I shall declare them as well as I can.</P>
<P>In the first place I do, with all sincere and Christian respect, acknowledg and
<PB N="102" REF="58"/>
commend that Indulgence thou giv∣est to all People professing Religion, dissenting from the National Com∣munion: for it is in it self a most <HI>Natural, Prudent</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> thing. <HI>Natural,</HI> because it preserves Nature from being made a Sacrifice to the savage Fury of fallible yet proud O∣pinions, out lawing Men of Parts, Arts, Industry and Honesty, the grand Re∣quisites of Humane Society; and ex∣posing them and their Families to utter Ruine for meer Noncon∣formity, not to Religion, but to Modes and Fashions in Religions. <HI>Christian,</HI> since the contrary ex∣presly contradicteth both the Precept and Example of Christ, who taught us to love Enemies, not to abuse our Friends, and triumph in the destru∣ction of our harmless Neighbours. He rebuked his Disciples, when they called for Fire from Heaven upon Dissenters, it may be Opposers: Cer∣tainly then he never intended that they should kindle Fire on Earth to devour Men for Conscience. And
<PB N="103" REF="58"/>
if Christ (to whom all Power was given) and his Apostles refused to employ Humane Force and Artifice so much as to conserve themselves, 'tis an Arrogancy every way indefen∣sible in those that pretend to be their Followers, that they assume an Au∣thority to supercede, controul and contradict the Precepts and Exam∣ples of Christ and his Apostles; whose Kingdom not being of the nature of this ambitious violent World, was not erected or maintain∣ed by those Weapons that are Carnal, but Spiritual and Intellectual, ade∣quate to the Nature of the Soul, and mighty through God to cast down the Strong-holds of Sin, and every vain Imagination exalted in Man a∣bove the lowly meek Fear of God, that ought to have the preeminence in the Hearts of the Sons of Men. Indulgence is <HI>Prudent,</HI> in that it preserveth Concord: No Kingdom divided against it self, can stand; It encourageth Arts, Parts &amp; Industry, to show and improve themselves, which
<PB N="104" REF="59"/>
indeed are the Ornaments, Strength and Wealth of a Countrey: It en∣courageth People to transplant into this Land of Liberty, where the Sweat of the Brow is not made the Forfeit of the Conscience. And, lastly, it rendereth the Prince pecu∣liarly <HI>Safe</HI> and <HI>Great. Safe,</HI> because all Interests, for Interest-sake, are bound to love and court him. <HI>Great,</HI> in that he is not govern'd or clogg'd with the Power of his Clergy, which in most Countries is not only a Coor∣dinate Power, a kind of Duumvirate∣ship in Government, <HI>Imperium in Imperio,</HI> at least an Eclipse to Mo∣narchy, but a Superior Power, and rideth the Prince to their Designs, holding the Helm of the Govern∣ment, and steering not by the Laws of Civil Freedom, but certain Ec∣clesiastick Maxims of their own, to the Maintenance and Enlargement of their Worldly Empire in their Church: And all the Villany acted under the sacred, peaceable and al∣luring Name of Christ, his Ministry
<PB N="105" REF="59"/>
and Church; though as remote from their Nature, as the Wolf from the Sheep, and the Pope from <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing I should have taken the liberty to have discours'd, would have been this; What Encourage∣ment a Colony of vertuous and in∣dustrious Families might hope to re∣ceive from Thee, in case they should transplant themselves into this Coun∣try, which certainly in it self is very excellent, respecting Taxes, Oaths, Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Further, to have represented the condition of some of our Friends, and thy own Subjects; who though they are liable to the same Tax as <HI>Mennists, &amp;c.</HI> (not by part the Case of other Dissenters) yet the Vaught of the Town where they live, came yesterday to forbid all preaching a∣mongst them, which implies a sort of Contradiction to the Indulgence given.</P>
<P>And in the last place, for as much as all Men owe their Being to some∣thing greater than themselves, to
<PB N="106" REF="60"/>
which 'tis reasonable to believe they are accomptable, from whence fol∣low Rewards or Punishments.</P>
<P>I had an earnest desire to have spoken of the Nature of Truth, Use, Benefit and Reward of Religion, and therein as to have discours'd what is Christian Religion in it self, (freed from those unreasonable Garbs some Men make it to wear, so justly offen∣sive to wise and thinking Men) so to have proved the Principle and Life of the People, in scorn called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to have been sutable to the true Fol∣lowers of Holy Jesus. But as the Parti∣culars would swell a Letter to a Book, I shall take the Freedom to present thee upon my Return with some Tracts treating upon all these Sub∣jects.</P>
<P>Prince, my Soul is filled with Love and Respect to thee and thy Family; I wish you all true and lasting Feli∣city, and earnestly desire that you may never forget your Afflictions, and in the remembrance of them be dehorted from those Lusts and Im∣pieties,
<PB N="107" REF="60"/>
which draw the Vengeance of Heaven upon the greatest Families on Earth, that God may look upon you with the favourable Eye of his Providence. And blessed is that Man, whose God (by profession) is the Lord in reality, <HI>viz.</HI> that is ruled and governed by the Lord, and that lives in subjection to his Grace, that having a Divine Sense of God in his Heart, delights to retain that Sense and Knowledg of him, and be me∣ditating in his Noble Royal Law, that converts the Soul to God, and re∣deems Man from the sensual Pleasures of this World, to the true Satisfaction of the Intellectual and Divine Life. O the meanness and lowness of their Spirits, that abandon themselves to the Government of Sense, the ani∣mal Life, thereby debasing their Na∣tures, rejecting the Divine Light, that shineth in their Hearts, saying, <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die</HI>; forgetting whence they are descended, and not considering the Peace and Joy of the Vertuous!</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="61"/>I desire that the Lord would put it into thy Heart to think of thy lat∣ter End, and with the Light of Christ in thy Conscience examine how it stands with thy Soul, that thou mayest know, and diligently watch to do those things that belong to thy eternal Peace.</P>
<P>One thing more give me leave to recommend to thee, and that is, to be very careful of inculcating generous, free and righteous Principles into thy Son, who is like to succeed thee, that when thou art gone, the Repu∣tation of the Country may not sink by contrary Practices, nor the People of divers Judgments (now thy Sub∣jects) be disappointed, distressed or ruined.

<P><PB N="109" REF="61"/>Which being done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.26. <HI>6th Month.</HI></NOTE> and having re∣freshed our selves, we returned that night by the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Worms,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Worms.</NOTE> from whence we the next Morning (being the first day of the Week) walked on Foot to <HI>Crisheim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crisheim.</NOTE> which is about six English Miles from <HI>Worms.</HI> We had a good Meeting from the tenth till the third Hour, and the Lord's Pow∣er sweetly opened to many of the In∣habitants of the Town that were at the Meeting; yea, the Vaught or chief Officer himself stood at the Door behind the Barn, where he could hear and not be seen, who went to the Priest and told him, that it was his Work, if we were Hereticks, to discover us to be such, but for his part he heard nothing but what was good, and he would not meddle with us.</P>
<P>In the Evening we had a more re∣tired Meeting of the Friends only, very weighty and tender; yea the Power rose in high operation among them, and great was the Love of
<PB N="110" REF="62"/>
God that rose in our Hearts at the Meeting to visit them; and there is a lovely, sweet and true Sense among them: we were greatly comforted in them, and they were greatly com∣forted in us. Poor Hearts, a little handful surrounded with great and mighty Countries of Darkness; 'tis the Lord's great Goodness, and Mer∣cy to them, that they are so finely kept, even natural in the Seed of Life; they were most of them ga∣thered by dear <HI>William Ames.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.27. 6<HI>th Month.</HI></NOTE>The next Morning we had another Meeting, where we took our leave of them, and so came accompanied by several of them to <HI>Worms</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worms.</NOTE> where having refresh'd our selves, we went to visit the Lutheran Priest, that was at the Meeting the sixth Day before at <HI>Crisheim</HI>; he received us very kind∣ly, and his Wife, not without some sense of our Testimony. After we had discours'd about an Hour with him of the true and heavenly Mini∣stry and Worship, and in what they stood, and what all People must come
<PB N="111" REF="62"/>
unto if ever they will know how to worship God aright, we departed, and immediately sent them several good Books of Friends in <HI>High-Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately we took Boat about the third Hour in the Afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.28.</NOTE> and came down the River <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mentz.</NOTE> where we arrived about the fifth Hour in the Morning, and immedi∣ately took an open Chariot for <HI>Frank∣fort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Frankfort.</NOTE> where we came about the first Hour in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>We presently informed some of those People that had received us the Time before, of our return to that City, with desires that we might have a Meeting that Afternoon; which was readily granted us by the Noble Women, at whose House we met, whither resorted some that we had not seen before. And the Lord did, after a living manner, open our Hearts and Mouths amongst them, which was received by them as a far∣ther confirmation of the coming of the Day of the Lord unto them; yea,
<PB N="112" REF="63"/>
with much joy and kindness they re∣ceived us.</P>
<P>The Meeting held till the ninth Hour at Night; they constrained us to stay and eat with them, which was also a blessed Meeting to them: be∣fore we parted, we desired a select Meeting the next Morning at the same Place of those that we felt more inwardly affected with Truth's Testi∣mony, and that were nearest unto the State of a silent Meeting; which they joyfully assented to.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.29. 6<HI>th Month.</HI></NOTE>We went to our Lodging, and the next Morning we returned unto them, with whom we had a blessed and heavenly Opportunity, for we had room for our Life amongst them; it was as among faithful Friends, Life ran as Oil, and swom a-top of all.</P>
<P>We recommended a silent Meeting unto them, that they might grow in∣to an holy Silence unto themselves; that the Mouth that calls God <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> that is not of his own Birth▪ may be stop'd, and all Images con∣founded, that they may hear the soft
<PB N="113" REF="63"/>
Voice of Jesus to instruct them, and receive his sweet Life to feed them and to build them up.</P>
<P>About the ninth Hour we departed from that Place, and went to <HI>Vander Walls,</HI> where the Meeting was the Time before, and there we had a more publick Meeting of all that pleased to come: The Lord did so a∣bundantly appear amongst us, that they were more broken than we had seen them at any time, yea they were exceeding tender and low, and the Love of God was much raised in their Hearts to the Testimony. In this sensible frame we left them, and the Blessings and Peace of our Lord Jesus Christ with and among them.</P>
<P>And after having refresh'd our selves at our Inn, we took Boat down the <HI>Main</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mentz.</NOTE> where we ar∣rived about the fifth Hour: 'tis a great City, but a dark and supersti∣tious Place, according to the Popish Way, and is under the Government of a Popish Bishop; we stayed not longer there, than till our Boat was
<PB N="114" REF="64"/>
ready, which might be better than half an Hour. From <HI>Mentz</HI> we went on our way down the <HI>Rhine</HI> six Ger∣man Miles, and came that Night to <HI>Hampack</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hampack. 5.30. 6<HI>th Month.</HI></NOTE> from thence the next Morning we went by <HI>Bacherach, Cob∣lentz,</HI> and other places upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tresy.</NOTE> to <HI>Tresy</HI> that Night, being a∣bout eleven German Miles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.31.</NOTE>Next day (being the sixth Day of the Week) we got to <HI>Cullen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cullen.</NOTE> a great Popish City, about the third Hour in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>We gave notice to a sober Mer∣chant in that Town, a serious Seeker a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter God, that we were there arri∣ved; who presently came to us. We sat down, and had a living and preti∣ous Opportunity with him, opening to him the Way of the Lord, as to us it had been mani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested; intreating him, if he knew any in that City, who had desires after the Lord, or that were willing to come to a Meet∣ing, that he would please to inform them of our being here, and of our desire to meet with them: He an∣swered,
<PB N="115" REF="64"/>
That he would readily do it.</P>
<P>This night when we were in Bed, came the Resident of several Princes (a serious and tender Man) to find us out; we had some discourse with him, but being late, promised to see us the next Day.</P>
<P>The next Morning came the afore∣said Merchant, informing us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7.1. 7<HI>th Month.</HI></NOTE> that it was a busy Time, several preparing for the Mass or great Fair at <HI>Frank∣fort</HI>; yet some would come, and he desired it might be at his House in the Afternoon about Three.</P>
<P>In the Morning we were to visit that Resident, whom we met coming to see us; but he returned and brought us to his House. We had a good Time with him, for the Man is an antient Seeker, opprest with the Cares of this World, and he may be truly said to mourn under them: his Heart was opened to us, and he bles∣sed God, that he had lived to see us. We gave him an Account, how the Lord appeared in the Land of our Na∣tivity, and how he had dealt with us,
<PB N="116" REF="65"/>
which was as the cool and gentle Showers upon the dry and scorched Desart. About Noon we returned Home; after we had eaten, we went to the Merchant's House to the Meet∣ing; where came four Persons, one of which was the Presbyterian Priest, who preach'd in private to the Prote∣stants of that Place, for they are no ways allowed in that City. Surely the true Day and Power of the Lord made known it self to the Consci∣ences of them present; yea, they felt that we were such as had been with Jesus, and that had obtained our Te∣stimony through the Sufferings and Travels of the Cross. They were tender: the Resident and Merchant conducted us to our Inn, and from thence to the Boat, being about seven at Night. We set out towards the City of <HI>Duysburgh</HI> of the Calvinist Way, belonging to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> in and near to which we had been informed there were a retired and seeking People.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.2. 7<HI>th Month.</HI> Duysburgh</NOTE></P>
<P>We arrived there next Day about
<PB N="117" REF="65"/>
Noon, being the first Day of the Week; the first thing we did after we came to our Inn, was to inquire out one Dr. <HI>Mastricht</HI> a Civilian, for whom we had a Letter to introduce us from a Merchant of <HI>Cullen:</HI> Whom quickly finding, we informed him what we came about, desiring his As∣sistance; which he readily promised us. The first thing we offered was an Access to the Countess of <HI>Falchen∣steyn</HI> and <HI>Bruch:</HI> He told us she was an extraordinary Woman, one in whom we should find things worthy of our Love; that he would write to her to give us an Opportunity with her; that the fittest time was the pre∣sent time, in that we might find her at the Minister's of <HI>Mulheim,</HI> on the other side of the River from her Fa∣ther's Castle; for that she used to come out the first Day Morning, and not return till Night: That we must be very shy of making our selves pub∣lick, not only for our own sakes, but for hers, who was severely treated by her Father for the Sake of those Reli∣gious
<PB N="118" REF="66"/>
Inclinations that appeared in her, although her Father pretended to be of the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>We therefore dispatched towards <HI>Mulheim,</HI> having received his Letter, and being also accompanied by him about one third of the way; but be∣ing six English Miles, and on foot, we could not compass the Place before the Meeting was over, for it was past three before we could get out of <HI>Duysburgh</HI>; and following that way which led to the back-side of the <HI>Greaf</HI>'s Castle and Orchard, which was also a common way to the Town, (tho if we had known the Country we might have avoided it) we met with one <HI>Henry Smith,</HI> Schoolmaster and Catechiser of <HI>Speldorp</HI>; to whom we imparted our Business, and gave the Letter of Dr. <HI>Mastricht</HI> of <HI>Duys∣burgh</HI> to introduce us to the Countess. He told us, he had just left her, being come over the Water from the Wor∣ship, but he would carry the Letter to her, and bring an Answer sudden∣ly, but notwithstanding staid near an
<PB N="119" REF="66"/>
Hour: When he came he gave us this Answer, <HI>viz.</HI> that she would be glad to meet us, but she did not know where; but rather inclined that we should go over the Water to the Mi∣nister's House whither, if she could, she would come, but that a strict hand was held over her by her Father. Af∣ter some more serious Discourse with him, concerning the Witness of God in the Conscience, and the Discove∣ry, Testimony, and Judgment of that true Light, unto which all must bow that would be Heirs of the Kingdom of God; recommending him to the same, we parted, he returning home∣wards, and we advancing to the Town: but being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cessitated to pass by her Father's Castle, who is Seig∣nour of the Country, it so fell out, that at that very instant he came forth to walk: And seeing us in the Habit of Strangers, sent one of his Atten∣dants to demand who and from whence we were, and whither we went, calling us to him, and asking us the same Questions. We answered,
<PB N="120" REF="67"/>
that we were Englishmen come from <HI>Holland,</HI> going no further in these Parts than his own Town of <HI>Mulheim.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mulheim.</NOTE> But not showing him, or paying him that worldly Homage and Respect which was expected from us, some of his Gentlemen ask'd us, if we knew whom we were before? and if we did not use to deport our selves after another manner before Noble-men, and in the presence of Princes? We answered, we were not conscious to our selves of any Disrespect or unseem∣ly Behaviour: one of them sharply re∣plied, Why don't you put off your Hats then? is it respect to stand covered in the presence of the Soveraign of the Country? We told them it was our practice in the presence of our Prince, who is a great King, and that we un∣covered not our Heads to any but to the Almighty God. Upon which the <HI>Graef</HI> called us <HI>Quakers,</HI> saying unto us, We have no need of <HI>Quakers</HI> here; get you out of my Dominions, you shall not go to my Town. We told him, that we were an innocent Peo∣ple
<PB N="121" REF="67"/>
that feared God, and had good∣will towards all Men; and that we had true Respect in our Hearts towards him, we would be glad to do him any real Good or Service; and that the Lord had made it Matter of Con∣science to us, not to conform our selves to the vain and fruitless Cu∣stoms of this World, or words to this purpose. However he commanded some of his Souldiers to see us out of his Territories, (to whom we also declared somewhat of the Reason and Intention of our coming to that Place in the Fear and Love of God) who were civil to us. We parted with much Peace and Comfort in our Hearts; and as we passed through the Village where the Schoolmaster dwelt, (yet in the Dominions of the <HI>Graef</HI>) we called upon him, and in the sense of God's Power and King∣dom open'd to him the Message and Testimony of Truth, which the Man received with a weighty and serious Spirit. For under the Dominion of the <HI>Graef</HI> there is a large Congrega∣tion
<PB N="122" REF="68"/>
of Protestants called <HI>Calvinists,</HI> of a more religious, inward and zea∣lous frame of Spirit, than any Body of People we met with or heard of in <HI>Germany.</HI> After we had ended our Testimony to him, we took our leave, desiring him not to fear, but to be of good Courage, for the Day of the Lord was hastning upon all the Work∣ers of Iniquity; and to them that feared his Name, wherever scattered throughout the Earth, he would cause the Sun of Righteousness to arise and visit them, with Healing under his Wings; and to remember us with true Love and Kindness to the Coun∣tess, Daughter to this <HI>Greaf,</HI> and to desire her not to be offended in us, nor to be dismayed at the Displeasure of her Father, but eye the Lord that hath visited her Soul with his holy Light, by which she seeth the Vanity of this World, and in some measure the em∣ptiness and deadness of the Religions that are in it; and he would preserve her from the Power of the Wrath of Men, that worketh not the Righte∣ousness
<PB N="123" REF="68"/>
of God: So we left the Peace of Jesus with him, and walked on to∣wards <HI>Duysburgh,</HI> being about six Eng∣lish Miles from thence, and near the eight Hour at Night. The Lord was with us, and comforted our Hearts as we walked (without any outward Guide) through a tedious and solita∣ry Wood (about three Miles long) with the Joy of his Salvation, giving us to remember, and to speak one un∣to another of his blessed Witnesses in the Days past, who wandred up and down like poor Pilgrims and Stran∣gers on the Earth, their Eye being to a City in the Heavens, whose Builder and Maker is God. Betwixt nine and ten, we reached the Walls of <HI>Duys∣burgh</HI>; but the Gates were shut, and there being no Houses without the Walls, we laid us down together in a Field, receiving both natural and spi∣ritual Refreshment, blessed be the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.3. 7<HI>th Month.</HI></NOTE> About three in the Morning we rose, sanctifying God in our hearts, that had kept us that Night; and walked till five, often speaking one to

Soon after the Clock had struck five, they opened the Gates of the City, and we had not long got to our Inn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duysburgh</NOTE> but it came upon me with a sweet, yet fervent Power to visit this prose∣cuted Countess with a Salutation from the Love and Life of Jesus, and to open unto her more plainly the Way of the Lord; which I did in this following Epistle.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JESUS, the Immaculate Lamb of God, (grieved and crucified by all the Workers of Iniquity) illumi∣nate thy Understanding, bless and be with thy Spirit for ever.</P>
<P>Tho unknown, yet art thou much beloved for the sake of thy Desires and Breathings of Soul after the living God: The Report whereof from some in the same State, hath made deep im∣pressions of true Kindness upon my Spirit, and raised in me a very singu∣lar and fervent inclination to visit thee; and the rather, because of that Suffering and Tribulation thou hast begun to endure for the sake of thy
<PB N="126" REF="70"/>
Zeal towards God, my self having from my Childhood been both a Seeker after the Lord, and a great Sufferer for that Cause from Parents, Relations, Companions, and the Ma∣gistrates of this World: the remem∣brance whereof hath so much the more endeared thy Condition unto me; and my Soul hath often in the sweet Sense and Feeling of the holy Presence of God, and the precious Life of his dear Son in my Heart, with great tenderness implored his Divine Assistance unto thee, that thou mayst both be illuminated to do, and made willing to suffer for his Name's sake, that the Spirit of God and of Glory may rest upon thy Soul. And truly I can say, I felt the good Will of God, his holy Care and heavenly Visitations of Love to extend unto thee. But one thing more especially lay upon my Spirit to have communi∣cated unto thee, which made me the more pressing for an Opportunity to speak with thee, and that was this;
<PB N="127" REF="70"/>
That thou shouldest have a true, right and distinct Knowledg of thy own State, and what that is which hath visited thee, and in what thy Faith, Patience, Hope and Salvation stand; where to wait, and how to find the Lord, and distinguish between that which is born of God, and that which is not; both with respect to thy self in all the Motions and Conceptions of thy Heart, and with respect to o∣thers in their Religious Worships and Performances, to the end that thou mayest not be deceived about the things relating to God's Kingdom, and thy Eternal Peace; this is of greatest weight. Now know cer∣tainly, that which hath discovered unto thee the Vanities of this World, the Emptiness and the Fading of all earthly Glory, the Blessedness of the Righteous, and the Joy of the World that is to come, is the Light of Christ Jesus, wherewith he hath enlight∣ned thy Soul; for in him was Life, and that Life is the Light of Man∣kind,
<PB N="128" REF="71"/>
<HI>John</HI> 1.4, 9. Thus God pro∣miseth by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> to <HI>give him,</HI> viz. <HI>for a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</HI> So that Christ the Light is God's Gift, and eternal Life is hid in him; yea, all the Trea∣sures of Wisdom and Knowledg, who is the Light of the Gospel-Temple, true Believers, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. And all that receive this Light into their Hearts, and bring their Deed to it, to see in what ground they are wrought, whether in God or in the evil One, and make this Blessed Light the Guide of their Life, fear∣ing with a holy Fear to do any thing that this Light manifests to be evil, waiting and watching with a godly Care to be preserved blame∣less before the Lord: I say, all such become Children of Light, and Wit∣nesses of the Life of Jesus. O bles∣sed wilt thou be for ever, if in the way of this Holy Light thy Mind walks to the end.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="71"/>Let this that hath visited thee lead thee, this Seed of Light and Life which is the Seed of the Kingdom; yea, 'tis Christ the true and only Seed of God that visited my Soul even in my young Years, that spread my Sins in order before me, reproved me, and brought godly Sorrow upon me; making me often to weep in so∣litary Places, saying within my Soul, O that I knew the Lord as I ought to know him; O that I served him as I ought to serve him: yea, often was there a great Concern upon my Spirit about my eternal State, mournfully desi∣ring that the Lord would give my Soul rest in the great Day of Trouble. Now was all the Glory of the World as a Bubble; yea, nothing was dear to me that I might win Christ: for the Love, Friendship and Pleasure of this World was a Burden unto my Soul. And in this seeking-state I was directed to the Testimony of Jesus in my own Con∣science, as the true shining Light, giving me to discern the Thoughts
<PB N="130" REF="72"/>
and Intents of my own Heart; and no fooner was I turned unto it, but I found it to be that which from my Childhood had visited me, though I distinctly knew it not: and when I received it in the Love of it, it shewed me all that ever I did, and reproved all the unfruitful Works of Darkness▪ judging me as a Man in the Flesh, and laying Judgment to the Line, and Righteousness to the Plummet in me: And as by the brightness of his coming into my Soul, he discovered the Man of Sin there upon his Throne, so by the Breath of his Mouth, which is the two-edged Sword of his Spi∣rit, he destroyeth his Power and Kingdom; and having made me a Witness of that Death of the Cross, he hath also made me Witness of his Resurrection. So that in good mea∣sure my Soul can now say, I am ju∣stified in the Spirit; and though the State of Condemnation unto Death was glorious, yet Justification unto Life was and is more glorious. In
<PB N="131" REF="72"/>
this state of the new Man all is new; behold new Heavens and a new Earth, old things come to be done away, the old Man with his Deeds put off. Now new Thoughts, new Desires, new Affections, new Love, new Friendship, new Society, new Kindred, new Faith, even that which overcometh this World through many Tribulations; and new Hope, even that living Hope that is founded upon true Experience, which holds out all Storms, and can see to the Glory that is invisible (to car∣nal Eyes) in the midst of the greatest Tempest. Now 'tis the same blessed Seed of Light, Life and Grace, that from God the Father is sown in thy Heart, and hath moved and wrought there that Change which thou hast witnessed from the Spirit of this World: turn to it, watch in it, that by it thou mayest be kept from all that it discovers to be contrary to God; espe∣cially from thy self, from thy own runnings, willings and strivings: for whatsoever is not born of the Spirit
<PB N="132" REF="73"/>
is Flesh, and that inherits not the Kingdom of God; and all that sow to it, shall inherit Corruption. By this thou wilt come to feel, not only all Sin to be a Burden, but all thy own Righteousness, yea, all Man's Righteousness to be a Burden. Thou wilt see the difference betwixt the Duties and Prayers which thou be∣gettest, and the Duties and Prayers which in thy true silence from all self-activity of Mind the Lord begets in thee. O that thou mightest know the Mystery of the new Birth, and what that is that can truly call God <HI>Father,</HI> even that that is begotten of him, which liveth and breatheth, and hath its Beginning and Being in that Life which is hid with Christ in God, and by which it hath been quickened to the Knowledg and Worship of Christ and God; and this thou shalt not fail to know and enjoy▪ as thou patiently sufferest the Lord to work his own Work in thee by his own blessed Spirit. And that
<PB N="133" REF="73"/>
which will give thee to savour and discern the right Motions and Con∣ceptions, Duties and Performances in thy self, from the false, will give thee to savour and discern that which is right in others, from that which is false; that which is of God, from that which is of Man. Have a Care of gathering of Sticks, and kindling a Fire of thy own, and then com∣passing thy self about the Sparks of the Fire which thou hast kindled; for the end of this State is to lie down in Sorrow, because the heavenly Fire is absent, which maketh the Sacrifice acceptable; yea, the Lord may stir in thy Heart, and thou mayest bring forth: but he that gives to conceive, he brings to the Birth, and he giveth Power to bring forth, for without Christ we can do nothing; and bles∣sed are they that stir not before the Angel moveth the Waters, and go not before Christ, but are led by him, and that awaken not their Beloved till he please, in whose Hand the
<PB N="134" REF="74"/>
Times and the Seasons are. O bles∣sed are they, whose Eyes are opened to see him always present, a God al∣ways nigh at Hand, whose Hearts are stayed upon his holy Appearance in them, and they are thereby trans∣lated into his Likeness, whose Faith and Hope is in Christ, in them the Hope of Glory.</P>
<P>My dear Friend, weigh these Things with a serious, retired, sweet and tender frame of Spirit; and the God that hath called me and thee, by the Light of his dear Son, open thy Understanding to perceive the Truth as it is in Jesus, and what is the My∣stery of the Fellowship of the Saints in Light. So to the Lord I recom∣mend thee, the Watchman and Keep∣er of <HI>Israel:</HI> the Lord be thy Strength and holy Comfort, and speak Peace to thee, and never leave thee nor for∣sake thee till he hath conducted thee through all Tribulations to his ever∣lasting Kingdom of Rest and Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="74"/>O dear Heart, be valiant, and stay thy self upon Christ Jesus the Ever∣lasting Rock, and feel him a Foun∣tain in thy Soul; feel his Blood to cleanse, and his Blood to drink, and his Flesh to eat; feed upon him, for God hath given him for the Life of the World.</P>
<P>I had seen thee had not thy Fa∣ther's strange sort of severity hindred: I confess I do not use to be so treated in my own Country, where the Lord hath raised up many hundreds of Wit∣nesses, that he hath gathered out of all Sects and Professions, to worship him, not in their Spirits or Wills, but in his Will, Spirit and Truth: and we are generally, after much Afflicti∣on and Suffering, in good Esteem, even with the great Ones of this World. And this let me add for thy particular Comfort, that though I have been a Man of great Anguish and Sorrow, because of the Scorn and Reproach that hath attended my separation from the World, (having been taught

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I <HI>Wish thy Salvation, and the Lord reward thee Good for the Evil that thou shewedst unto me and my Friends the last night, if it be his Will. But since thou art a mortal Man, one that must give an Account, in common with all, to the Immortal God, let me a little ex∣postulate with thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By what Law on Earth are Men, not scandalous, under no Proscription, harm∣less Strangers about lawful Occasions, and Men not Vagabonds, but of good Quality in their own Country; stopt, me∣naced, sent back with Souldiers, and that at Sun-set, exposed to the Night in an unknown Country, and therefore forced to lie in the Fields: I say, by what Law are we judged, yea, thus pu∣nished before heard: Is this the</HI> Jus Gentium <HI>or</HI> Germanicum, Naturale <HI>or</HI> Christianum? <HI>Oh! Where's Nature? Where's Civility? Where's Hospitality? But where's Christianity all this while?
<PB N="146" REF="78"/>
Well, but we are</HI> Quakers; Quakers, <HI>What's that for a Name? Is there a Law of the Empire against that Name? No, Did we own it? No, but if we had, the letters of that Name neither make up Drunkard, Whore-master, Thief, Mur∣derer nor Traitor: Why so odious then? What harm hath it done? Why could</HI> Jews <HI>pass just before us, that have cruci∣fied Christ, and not</HI> Quakers <HI>that never crucified him; but</HI> Ignorance <HI>is as well the Mother of</HI> Persecution <HI>as</HI> Devotion, <HI>and the false</HI> Christian, <HI>and the false</HI> Jew <HI>have but one Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But</HI> Argumentum ad hominem, <HI>my Friend bear with me a little: Art thou a Christian? How canst thou be rude, un∣civil, and persecute then? Thou art to love Enemies, not abuse Friends, harm∣less Strangers. Well, but this Life is dead, this Doctrine antiquated, Jesus Christ turn'd out of doors, I perceive: What art thou for a</HI> Christian? <HI>A</HI> Lu∣theran? <HI>Yes, Canst thou so lately forget the Practises of the</HI> Papists, <HI>and with what Abhorrence thy Ancestors declared against such sort of Entertainment? Were
<PB N="147" REF="78"/>
not they despised, mocked and persecuted? And are their Children treading in the steps of their old Enemies? Friend, 'tis not reformed Words, but a reformed Life that will stand thee instead: 'tis not to live the life of the Unregenerate, World∣ly-minded, and Wicked under the Pro∣fession of the Saint's Words, that will give an Entrance into God's rest: Be not de∣ceived, such as thou Sowest, such must thou Reap in the Day of the Lord. Thou art not come to the</HI> Berean-state <HI>that tried all things, and therefore not noble in the Christian sense; the</HI> Bereans <HI>were noble, for they judged not before Exami∣nation. And for thy saying,</HI> We want no <HI>Quakers</HI> here, <HI>I say,</HI> under favour you do, <HI>for a true</HI> Quaker <HI>is one that trembleth at the Word of the Lord, that worketh out his Salvation with fear and trembling, and all the Days of his ap∣pointed Time waiteth in the Light and Grace of God till his great Change com∣eth, and that taketh up the daily Cross to his Will and Lusts, that he might do the Will of God manifested to him by the Light of Jesus in his Conscience, and ac∣cording

to the holy Precepts and Ex∣amples in the holy Scriptures of Truth, laid down by Jesus, and his followers, for the Ages to come. Yea, he is one that loveth his Enemies, rather than feareth them; that Blesseth those that Curse him, and prayeth for those that despitefully treat him; as God knoweth we do for thee. And O that thou wert such a</HI> Quaker! <HI>Then wouldst thou Rule for God, and act in all things as one that must give an account to God for the Deeds done in the Body, whether Good or Evil. Then would Temperance, Mercy, Justice, Meekness, and the Fear of the Lord dwell in thy Heart, and in thy Family and Country. Repent, I exhort thee, and consider thy latter End, for thy Days are not like to be many in this World, there∣fore mind the things that make for thy Eternal Peace, least Distress come upon thee as an armed Man, and there be none to deliver thee.

<P><PB N="149" REF="79"/>This having done, we went to Dr. <HI>Mastricht</HI>'s to inform him of what had past, who tho' of a kind Disposition, and very friendly to us, yet seemed surprized with fear (the Disease of this Country) crying out, <HI>What will become of this poor Countess!</HI> Her Fa∣ther hath called her <HI>Quaker</HI> a long time, behaving himself very severely to her, but now he will conclude she is one indeed, and he will lead her a lamentable Life: <HI>I know</HI> (said he) <HI>you care not for suffering, but she is to be pittied</HI>: We told him that we both loved her, and pittied her, and could lay down our Lives for her, as Christ hath done for us, in the Will of God, if we could thereby do her good, but that we had not mentioned her Name, neither was the Letter, that he gave us to her, so much as seen or known of her Father. But still he feared that our Carriage would incense the <HI>Graef</HI> so much the more against both his Daugh∣ter, and all those serious and inqui∣ring People up and down the Coun∣try: We answered with an earnest∣ness
<PB N="150" REF="80"/>
of Spirit, That they had minded the Incensings and Wrath of Men too much already, and true Religion would never spring or grow under such fears, and that it was time for all that felt any thing of the Work of God in their Hearts to cast away the slavish fear of Man, and to come forth in the boldness of the true Chri∣stian life; yea, that Sufferings break and make way for greater Liberty, and that God was wiser and stronger than Man. We askt him if there were any in that City who enquired more diligently after the way of the Lord, he recommended us (as we had already been informed in ano∣ther place) to the Family of the <HI>Prae∣tor,</HI> or chief Governour of the Town, whose Wife and Sister more especial∣ly were seeking after the best things: So we parted with him in love, and by the help of his Daughter, were conducted to this Family. We had not been long there, before a School-master of <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI> and withal a Mi∣nister came in enquiring after us, ha∣ving

h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard at <HI>Mulheim</HI> where he preached the day before to the Peo∣ple, or else by the way, of our at∣tempt to visit that place, and the En∣tertainment we received at the hands of the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ef</HI>; He sat down with us, and though we had already a sweet Opportunity, yet feeling the Power to rise, the Meeting renewed: And O magnified be the Name of the Lord, he witnessed to our Testimony abun∣dantly in all their Hearts and Con∣sciences, who were broken into much tenderness, and certainly there is a blessed Power and Zeal stirring in that young Man, yea he is very near the Kingdom. So we took our Leave of them, leaving the Lord's Peace and Blessing upon them. It was now some∣thing past the 12th. Hour of the Day. In the way to our Lodging we met a Messenger from the Countess, a pretty young tender Man near to the King∣dom, who saluted us in her Name with much love, telling us, That she was much grieved at the Ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain∣ment of her Father towards us, ad∣vising
<PB N="152" REF="81"/>
us not to expose our selves to such Difficulties and Hardships, for it would grieve her Heart, that any that came in the Love of God to vi∣sit her, should be so severely handled; for at some he sets his Dogs, upon others he puts his Souldiers to beat them: <HI>But what shall I say, That it self, must not hinder you from doing good,</HI> said the Countess, We answered him, that his Message was joyful to us, that she had any regard to us, and that she was not offended with us: We desi∣red the Remembrance of our kind Love unto her, and that he would let her know that our Concern was not for our selves, but for her: We invi∣ted him to eat with us, but he told us he was an Inhabitant of <HI>Meurs,</HI> and was in haste to go home; so we brief∣ly declared our Principle and Mes∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge, recommending him to Christ the true Light in his Conscience, and parted: So we went home to Dinner, having neither eaten nor drank since first-day Morning, and having lain out all Night in the Field. We had
<PB N="153" REF="81"/>
no sooner got to our Inn, but the Man was constrained to come after us, and sat down with us, and enquired con∣cerning our Friends; their Rise, Prin∣ciples and Progress, and in all things that he desired satisfaction about, he declared himself satisfied. Dinner be∣ing done, and all cleared, we departed that City, being about th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fourth Hour in the Afternoon, and for want of Accommodation were forced to walk on foot 8 <HI>English</HI> Miles to a Town called <HI>Holton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Holton.</NOTE> where we rested that Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning we set out for <HI>Wesel</HI> and got thither at Noon.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>7</HI>th. Month. 3.4. <HI>Wesel.</HI></NOTE> The first thing we did (as had been our Custom) was to enquire who was worthy, particularly for two Persons recommended to us by the Countess of <HI>Hornes,</HI> that lives with the Princess <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> But upon enquiry, we found one of them was gone to <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> with his Wife, who had been formerly a Preacher, but being con∣scienciously dissatisfied with his own Preaching, laid it down, and is now
<PB N="154" REF="82"/>
in a seeking State. But in lied of him we found out three more▪ with the other Person that had been recom∣mended to us. We bespoke a Meet∣ing amongst them after Dinner; which ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordingly we had at a Woman's House of good Note in the Town▪ who told us, That she had been long in a solitary Estate, dissatisfied with the Religions generally profest in that Country, waiting for Salvation, and she hoped that now the time was come, and that we were the Messengers of it.</P>
<P>The Lord was with us in the Mee∣ting, and their Hearts were opened by the Word of God, to receive our Testimony as glad Tidings of Salva∣tion. Meeting being done, we im∣mediately returned to our Lodging, desiring we might see them together in the same place the next Morning to take our Leave of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7<HI>th. Month.</HI> 4.5.</NOTE> to which they readily assented.</P>
<P>Next Morning we came, and had a precious Meeting with them, and there were some present that were not there the Night before: So we left
<PB N="155" REF="82"/>
them in much Love, and went to our Inn, where after having refresht our selves we went to <HI>Rees,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rees.</NOTE> where we met with a Counsellor of <HI>Gelderlandt,</HI> with whom we had a good Oppor∣tunity to declare the Testimony of <HI>Jesus,</HI> who received it, and parted with us in much kindness.</P>
<P>From thence we went to <HI>Emrick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emrick.</NOTE> and there called upon an eminent Baptist-teacher, recommended to us by one of <HI>Wesel,</HI> we spent some time with him, opening to him the way of Life, as in the Light it is manife∣sted to all that love and obey the Light, and of that more spiritual and pure Ministry that from the Living Word of God is received by many true Ministers in this Day; the Man was somewhat full of Words, but we felt the living Visitation of the Love of God reacht to him, and so we left him, making all the haste we could to get to <HI>Cleve</HI> that night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cleve▪</NOTE> which ac∣cordingly we did, though late, being forced to walk one third-part of the way on foot.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="83"/>That Night, notwithstanding, one of us went to a certain Lady, to whom we had Recommendations from the Princess, and that was particu∣larly known to one of us, informing her that we were come to that City, desiring to know what time next day we might give her a Visit; she ap∣pointed Eight in the Morning. About that time we went to see her,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>7</HI>th. Month. 5.6.</NOTE> she re∣ceived us (considering her Quality and Courtship) far from any appea∣rance of Offence at our Deportment: We told her our Message and Visit was to those of that City, that had any Inclinations or Desires, Hunger or Thirst after the true and living Knowledge of God; for that end we had left our own Country, and had wandred up and down in several parts of <HI>Germany</HI>; she told us, That some there were that searched after God, but the feared the Name of <HI>Quaker</HI> would make them shy, because they were called <HI>Quakers</HI> themselves by People of the same Profession, only for be∣ing more serious and retired in their
<PB N="157" REF="83"/>
Conversation. We replied, That it was an honour to the Name, that all Sobriety throughout <HI>Germany</HI> was cal∣led by it; this ought to make the Name less odious, yea it will make the way easier for those that are tru∣ly called so, or that are <HI>Quakers</HI> in∣deed; it will take off much of the wonder, and, it may be, of the Seve∣rity of the places where we come, that the Name is gone before us, and hath received a Dwelling-place in their Towns and Cities. In fine, to all such God had committed to us the Word of Life to preach, and such we seek out in all places where the Lord bringeth us; and hitherto we can say it to the praise of our God, he hath vindicated our Service and Testimo∣ny, by his own blessed Power, shed a∣broad in their hearts to whom we have been sent.</P>
<P>So she told us she would send for an Attorney at Law, one that was more than ordinarily eminent, ha∣ving deserted the Church, and being therefore reproached with the Name of <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="84"/>In this Interval we had close dis∣course with her, a Woman certainly of great Wit, high Notions, and ve∣ry ready Utterance; so that it was hard for us to obtain a true silence, a state in which we could reach to her. But through some travel of Spi∣rit more than ordinary, we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sweet time of refreshment, and the Witness was raised in her, and we really and plainly beheld a true No∣bility, yea that which was sensible of our Testimony, and did receive it.</P>
<P>By this time the person she se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for came, and a blessed sweet time we had, for the power and presence of the Lord our staff and strength, into which our eye hath been throughout all our travels, that we might onely be acceptable in that, plenteously appeared amongst us (the Lord have the glory of his own work) both confessing to the truth of what had been said, and the At∣torney to the living sense in which the truth had been declared. We
<PB N="159" REF="84"/>
would have returned to our Inn to eat, according as we had appointed in the morning, but she laid a kind of violent hands upon us, and ne∣cessitated us to stay and eat with her, which we did. And we had no sooner sat down, but her Brother in Law, a Man of quality and employment in that Court of the Elector of <HI>Brunden∣burg</HI> came in, who dined with us. As we sat at Meat, we had a good meet∣ing, for the time was much taken up about the Things of God, either in answering their questions, or our ministring to them about the true Christian nature and life; in all which her Brother behaved himself with great sweetness and respect. After Dinner we took our Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istian leave of them in the fear of God, re∣commending unto them the Light of Christ Jesus, that brings all that re∣ceive it into the one Spirit, to live in holy Peace and Concord together, particularly and alone speaking to the Lady, and the Attorney what was upon us to their States.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="85"/>And so we departed, and soon af∣ter took Waggon for <HI>Nimwegen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nimwe∣gen.</NOTE> where arriving about the 7th hour that night, we immediately took Waggon for <HI>Utrecht,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Utrecht. <HI>7</HI> th.

you to all the vain-glory, and pleasure and empty worships that are in it; this is from above the heavenly seed of God, pure and incorruptible, that's come down from Heaven to make you hea∣venly, that in heavenly places you may dwell and witness with the Saints of old, this heavenly Treasure in earthen vessels. O stay your minds upon the appearance of Jesus in you, in whose light you shall see light; it will make you of a weighty considering spirit more and more, that you may see how the mystery of iniquity hath wrought, and how mankind is corrupted in all things, and what part you yet have, that be∣longeth not to the paradise of God, that you may lay it all down at the feet of Jesus and follow him, who is going up and down, doing good to all that be∣lieve in his Name. So possess your Souls in the sensible feeling of his daily divine visits, shinings and breathings upon your spirits, and wait diligently and watch circumspectly, lest the enemy surprize you, or your Lord come at unawares upon you, and you be unprepared to receive his

sweet and precious visitations; that so those holy beginnings, which thou art a witness of with thy companions, may not be lost, or as if they had never been, but that you may from day to day feel the growth of his light, life, power and king∣dom in your souls, that you may be able to say, the kingdom of God is come, yea it is given to the Saints. And what I say unto one, I say unto all that received our Testimony in that City, to whom thou mayest give, if thou pleasest, the remem∣brance of my dear Love, who travel in the Spirit for their redemption, that they may be brought into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God: particularly salute me the young Woman, that met with us at thy Lodging. The Lord Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace, dwell amongst you, keep your hearts steadfast in his holy Light, without wavering, all the days of your appointed time, until your great and last change shall come, when he will receive his own Sheep into his own ever∣lasting Kingdom from the power of the Foxes ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Wolves, and all the devou∣ring Beasts and Birds of prey, when he

<P><HI>So dear</HI> I. E.

<PB N="169" REF="89"/>
Bed; we told the Graef at parting, we were Men that feared the Almighty God, we desired the good of all Men, and we came not thither for any evil design, but he would not hear; the Lord, if he plea∣seth, forgive him. Nevertheless we had a good Meeting at</HI> Duysburg, <HI>where we had our heart's desire, the blessed power and life of God making its own way in the hearts of those that heard our Testi∣mony: I also writ a large and tender Letter to the Countess, and received a sweet and loving Message from her; and I have great hopes that all things will work for the best.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From</HI> Duysburg <HI>we went to</HI> Wesel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wesel.</NOTE> <HI>where we inquired out who was worthy, where we found four or five separated from all Congregations, waiting for the Consolation of</HI> Israel, <HI>with whom we had two precious Meetings; and leaving the peace of Jesus with them, went to</HI> Em∣rick, <HI>where we visited the chief Bap∣tist-teacher, who confessed to our Testi∣mony, and received us lovingly: We di∣rected him to that gift of God in him∣self, that pure and eternal Word in the

heart, that he might know the pure Mi∣nistry of that, from the Ministry of Man's Spirit, which cannot profit or give life to the Soul. From thence we went to</HI> Cleve, <HI>where at a Lady's House be∣longing to the Court, we had a preci∣ous Meeting, and we found some that had deserted the publick Ministry, as not being anointed of God to preach, neither knowing by a true experience the way and travel of the new birth, but are made and maintained by Men, we sounded the joyfull Gospel amongst them. And from thence by the way of</HI> Nimme∣gen <HI>and</HI> Utrecht <HI>we came the last sixt day to</HI> Amsterdam, <HI>which was the</HI> 7<HI>th of the</HI> 7<HI>th Month.

<PB N="171" REF="90"/>
<HI>where we met with some of our Brethren, that had been up at</HI> Ham∣burgh <HI>and</HI> Frederickstadt; <HI>and this day we are to have two Meetings in this City, the one among our Friends, the other publick for the Town. It is upon me to visit</HI> de Labadie <HI>'s People, that they might know him in themselves, in whom their Salvation standeth; for these simple people are to be pittied. From thence I think to visit</HI> Leeuwa∣erden, Groningen, Embden, Bremen, Herwerden, Wesel, Emrick, Cleve, Utrecht, <HI>and so to return to</HI> Amster∣dam, <HI>the Lord enabling me by his Power.</HI></P>

<P>Next Morning about the 4th hour I took Boat for <HI>Leeuwaerden, J. Claus</HI> who had been at <HI>Frederickstadt</HI> with <HI>G.F.</HI> went with me. <HI>G.F. J.Y.</HI> and <HI>T.R.</HI> with <HI>P. Hendricks</HI> returned that day towards <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leeuwa∣erden.</NOTE>At <HI>Leeuwaerden</HI> we came about 9, and began the Meeting about 10; which we enjoyed with peace and re∣freshment, several being there (as in other places) that were never at a Meeting before.</P>
<P>The Meeting being done, and ha∣ving refresht our selves with food, we took Waggon for <HI>Wiewart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wiewart.</NOTE> the Man∣sion-house of the Family of the <HI>So∣merdykes,</HI> where <HI>De Labadie's</HI> Com∣pany resideth, it being strong upon my Spirit to give them a Visit. We
<PB N="173" REF="91"/>
got thither about 5, and as we were walking over a Field to the House, we met a young Man of that Com∣pany who conducted us in. I askt for <HI>Ivon</HI> the Pastor, and <HI>Anna Maria Schurmans: Ivon</HI> presently came with his Co-pastor who received us very civilly, however they seemed shy of letting me speak with <HI>A. M. S.</HI> obje∣cting her Weakness, Age, taking Phy∣sick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but putting them in mind how unhandsomely I was used at <HI>Her∣werden</HI> six Years a-go, by <HI>de Labadie</HI> their Father, who, though I came a great Journy to visit him and his Peo∣ple, suffered me not to speak with them; they presently complied, and went in to let her know, that such a Person desired to speak with her, and quickly returned, desiring me to come in: But fore-seeing my time would be too short for my Message, the Sun being near setting, and hav∣ing 2 <HI>English</HI> Miles of unknown way to our Lodging on foot, desired them that they would give an Opportunity the next Morning, which they readi∣ly
<PB N="174" REF="92"/>
complied with. So I took my leave of them, who in a Friendly manner brought us a little on our way. That night a great weight was upon my Spirit, and especially the next Morning, yet my Faith was in the power of God, and I had a plain sight, that I should have a good ser∣vice among them, however I should clear my Conscience, and my Peace should rest with me.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7<HI>th. Month.</HI> 5.13.</NOTE>The next Morning I returned to them, and <HI>John Claus</HI> along with me; so soon as we came, we were brought into <HI>A.M. Shurman's</HI> Chamber, where also was with her one of the three <HI>Somerdikes.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>A. M. S.</HI> aforesaid is an anci∣ent Maid, above 60 Years of Age, of great Note and Fame for Learning in Languages and Philosophy, and hath obtained a considerable place a∣mong the most learned Men of this Age. The <HI>Somerdikes</HI> are Daughters to a Noble-man of the <HI>Hague,</HI> people of great Breeding and Inhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ances. These, with several other Persons, be∣ing
<PB N="175" REF="92"/>
affected with the zealous Decla∣mation of <HI>de Labadie,</HI> against the dead and formal Churches of the World, and awakened to seek after a more spi∣ritual Fellowship and Society, separa∣ted themselves from the common <HI>Cal∣vinist</HI> Churches, and followed him in the way of a refined <HI>Independency.</HI> They are a serious, plain People, and are come nearer to Friends; as in Si∣lence in Meetings, Women-speaking, Preaching by the Spirit, Plainness in Garb, and Furniture in their Houses than formerly, and more than any o∣ther People I know. With these two we had the Company of the two Pa∣stors, and a Doctor of Physick: After some silence, I proposed this Questi∣on to them, <HI>What was it that induced them to separate from the common Way they formerly lived in?</HI> I desired them that they would be pleased to be plain and open with me, as to the ground of their separation, for I came not to cavil, but in the Christian Spirit to be informed.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="93"/>Upon this <HI>Ivon</HI> the chief Pasto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gave us the History of <HI>de Labadie</HI>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Education, how he was bred among the <HI>Jesuites</HI> and Deserted them, and embraced the Protestant Religion, and finally of his great Satisfaction with the Protestant Churches of <HI>France,</HI> and that if God would not give them a purer Church, they three would set down by themselves, resolving never more to mix themselves among the <HI>Ba∣bylonish</HI> Assemblies of the World, ad∣ding several solemn Appeals concern∣ing the Simplicity and Integrity of their Hearts in these things.</P>
<P><HI>Ivon</HI> having done, <HI>A. M. Shurmans</HI> began in this manner, <HI>I find my self constrained to add a short Testimony.</HI> She told us of her former life, of her pleasure in Learning, and her love to the Religion she was brought up in, but she confessed she knew not God or Christ all that while; and though from a Child God had visited her at times, yet she never felt such a pow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rful Stroke as by the Ministry of <HI>de Labadie</HI>: She saw her learning to be
<PB N="177" REF="93"/>
vanity, and her Religion like a Body of Death; she resolved to despise the Shame, desert her former way of Liv∣ing and Acquaintance, and to join her self with this little Family that was retired out of the World, among whom she desired to be found a living Sacri∣fice, offer'd up entirely to the Lord. She spoke in a very serious and broken Sense, not without some trembling; These are but short hints of what she said.</P>
<P>After she had done, One of the <HI>So∣merdikes</HI> began, in a very reverent and weighty frame of Mind, and in a Sense that very well suited her Con∣tempt of the World: She told us how often she had mourned from her young Years because she did not know the Lord, as she desired; of∣ten saying within her self, <HI>If God would make known to me his Way, I would trample upon all the Pride and Glory of the World.</HI> She earnestly ex∣prest the frequent Anguish of Spirit she had because of the Deadness and Formality of the Christians she was
<PB N="178" REF="94"/>
bred among, saying to her self, <HI>O the Pride, O the Lusts, O the vain plea∣sures in which Christians live! Can thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be the way to Heaven? Is this the way to Glory? Are these followers of Christ▪ O no! O God, Where is thy little Flock! Where is thy little Family that will live intirely to thee, that will follow thee? Make me one of that number; and when the Servant of the Lord</HI> de Labadie <HI>came into</HI> Holland, <HI>I, among others, had a curiosity to hear him, and, among se∣veral others, was deeply affected by him. He spoke the very Thoughts of my heart; me-thought my heart was pricked when I heard him, and I resolved by the grace of God to abandon all the Glory and Pride of this World to be one of those that should set down with him in a se∣paration from the vain and dead Wor∣ships of this World. I count my self hap∣py that I ever met with him, and these Pastors, who seek not themselves but the Lord; and we are a Family that live together in love; of one Soul, and one Spirit, intirely given up to serve the Lord; and this is the greatest Joy in the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="94"/>After her <HI>du Lignon,</HI> the other Pa∣stor, gave us also an account of his Inducement to embrace <HI>J. de Labadie,</HI> but not so lively.</P>
<P>After him the Doctor of Physick, that had been bred for a Priest, (but voluntarily refused that Calling) ex∣prest himself after this manner: <HI>I can also bear my Testimony in the presence of God, that tho I lived in as much Repu∣tation at the University, as any of my Collegues or Companions, and was well re∣puted for Sobriety and Honesty, yet I ne∣ver felt such a living sense of God, as when I heard the Servant of the Lord</HI> de Labadie; <HI>adding, The first Day I heard him, I was so struck and affected, that I can truly say, through the good Grace of God, and the Conduct of the Holy Spi∣rit, it was to me as the Day of my Sal∣vation, he did so lovingly touch my heart with the sense of the true Christian Worship: Upon which I forsook the Uni∣versity, and resolved to be one of this Family; and this I can say in the fear of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="95"/><HI>P. Ivon</HI> concludeth, This is what we have to say concerning the Work of God amongst us.</P>
<P>All this while I minded not so much their Words, as I felt and had Unity, with a measure of divine Sense that was upon them: Certainly the Lord hath been amongst them; yea, I had a living Sense in my heart that somewhat of the Breath of Life had breathed upon them; and though they were in great mixtures, yet that God's love was towards them.</P>
<P>After some silence I began on this wise: I come not to judge you, but to visit you; not to quarrel or dispute, but to speak of the things of God's Kingdom, and I have no prejudice, but great love and regard in my heart towards you: Wherefore hear me with Christian patience and tenderness. I do confess and believe that God hath touched your hearts with his divine finger, and that his work is amongst you; that it was his Spirit that gave you a sight of the vanity and folly of this World, and that hath made you
<PB N="181" REF="95"/>
sensible of the dead Religions that are in it. 'Tis this Sense I love and ho∣nour; and I am so far from underva∣luing or opposing this tender sense I feel upon you, that this is it I am come to visit, and you for the love of it: And as for the reproaches that may attend you on the score of your se∣paration, with all the Reports that therefore go concerning you, they are what I respect you for, being well acquainted with the nature and pra∣ctise of this World towards those that retire out of it. Now since I have, with patience, and I can truly say with great satisfaction, heard your ac∣count of your Experiences, give me the like Christian freedome to tell you mine, to the end you may have some sense of the Work of God in me: For those who are come to any mea∣sure of a divine Sense, they are as looking-glasses to each other, seeing themselves in each other, as face an∣swereth face in a glass.</P>
<P>Here I began to let them know, how and when the Lord first appea∣red
<PB N="182" REF="96"/>
unto me, which was about the 12th. Year of my Age, <HI>Anno</HI> 1656. How at times, betwixt that and 15, the Lord visited me; and the divine Impres∣sions he gave me of himself: Of my Persecution at <HI>Oxford</HI>; how the Lord sustained me in the midst of that hel∣lish darkness and debauchery; of my being banisht the College, the bitter Usage I underwent when I returned to my Father; whipping, beating and turning out of doors in 1662, of the Lord's dealings with me in <HI>France,</HI> and in the time of the great Plague in <HI>London:</HI> In fine, the deep sense he gave me of the Vanity of this World, of the Irreligiousness of the Religions of it: Then of my Mournful and Bit∣ter Cries to him that he would show me his own way of Life and Salvati∣on, and my Resolutions to follow him whatever Reproaches or Sufferings should attend me, and that with great reverence and brokenness of Spirit, How after all this the glory of the world over-took me, and I was even ready to give up my self unto, it, seeing no
<PB N="183" REF="96"/>
such thing as the Primitive Spirit and Church on the Earth, and being rea∣dy to faint concerning my hope of the restitution of all things; and that it was at this time that the Lord visited me with a certain sound and testimo∣ny of his eternal Word, through one of those the World calls a <HI>Quaker.</HI> I related to them the bitter Mockings and Scornings that fell upon me, the Displeasure of my Parents, the Inve∣ctiveness and Cruelty of the Priests, the strangeness of all my Companions, what a Sign and Wonder they made of me; but, above all, that great Cross of resisting and watching against my own Inward vain Affections and Thoughts. Here I had a fine oppor∣tunity to speak of the Mystery of Ini∣quity and Ungodliness in the Root and ground, and to give them an ac∣count of the Power and Presence of God, which attended us in our pub∣lick Testimonies and Sufferings; af∣ter an indirect manner censuring their Weaknesses, by declaring and com∣mending the contrary practises a∣mong
<PB N="184" REF="97"/>
Friends, too large to be here related. And notwithstanding all my Sufferings and Tryals by Magistrates, Parents, Companions, and, above, all from the Priests of the false Religions in the World, the Lord hath preser∣ved me to this day, and hath given me an hundred fold in this World, as well as the assurance of Life everlast∣ing: Informing them of the tender∣ness of my Father to me before, and at his death, and how, through pati∣ence and long-suffering, all opposition was conquered: Then beginning my Exhortation unto them, which was on this wise.</P>
<P>That therefore since God had gi∣ven me and them a divine Sense of him, our Eye might be to him, and not to Man, that we might come more into a silence of our selves, and a growth into that heavenly Sense. That this was the Work of the true Ministry, not to keep People to them∣selves, ever teaching them, but to turn them to God, the new Covenant-tea∣cher, and to Christ the great Gospel-teacher.
<PB N="185" REF="97"/>
Thus, <HI>John</HI> did, and thought it no dishonour, that they left him to go to Christ. <HI>Behold the Lamb of God,</HI> saith he, <HI>that taketh away the Sins of the World!</HI> And even <HI>John</HI>'s Disci∣ples left him to follow Christ: Nay, <HI>John</HI> testifies of himself, <HI>That he was to decrease, and Christ was to encrease.</HI> Wherefore I prest them to have their eye to Christ that taketh away the Sin, that is from Heaven, heavenly; to see that he increase in them. Yea, that henceforward they should know no Man after the Flesh, no, not Christ himself. That their knowledge of▪ and regard and fellowship one with another, would stand in the Revela∣tion of the Son of God in them, which is God's great Prophet by whom God speaketh in these latter days: And if their Ministers be true Ministers, they will count it their glory to give way to Christ, and that they decrease, and Christ encrease; that the instru∣ment giveth way to him that useth it, the Servant to the Lord; which though it seemeth to detract from the
<PB N="186" REF="98"/>
Ministers, yet it was and is the glory of a true Minister, that God and Christ should be all in all, and that his Will should be fulfilled: For the day of the Lord God was come, and all Peo∣ple must look to him for Salvation: That all People must now come to keep God's great Sabbath, to rest from meer Man, and the Spirit of Man, and all Men's thoughts, words and works; and that if they were true Believers, they were, at least, entring into their rest. I closely recommend∣ed that to them, that they might not be of those that begin in the Spirit, and end in the Flesh; for that those that should do so, and thereby break God's Sabbath-day, should be stoned to death by the Stone which is cut out of the Mountain without hands; yea, that should fall upon them as a Milstone and grind them to Powder. Therefore let Christ have his honour, let him preach and speak among you, and in you, and you in him, and by him only to sigh, groan, pray, preach, sing, and not otherwise, least Death
<PB N="187" REF="98"/>
come over you; for thereby the Aposta∣cy came in, by their going before Christ, instead of Christ going before them. And wait in the Light and Spirit of Judgment that hath visited you, that all may be wrought out that is not born of God, so will you come to be born of the incorruptible Seed of the Word of God that liveth and abideth for ever. That you may be a holy Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sthood, that offers up a living Sa∣crifice with God's heavenly fire, that God may have his honour in you all and through you all by Christ Jesus. And turning my self towards the <HI>So∣merdikes,</HI> with a serious and tender Spirit I thus exprest my self: <HI>That you should be Pilgrims in the Inheritance of your Father, I have a deep and reverent sense of: O that you might dwell with him for ever, and exalt him that hath so vi∣sited you, with whom are the Rewards of Eternal Blessedness!</HI></P>
<P>So I left the blessing and peace of Jesus among them, departing in the love and peace of God; and I must needs say, they were beyond ex∣pectation,
<PB N="188" REF="99"/>
tender and respectfull to us; all of them coming with us but the ancient <HI>A. M. S.</HI> (who is not a∣ble to walk) to the outward Door▪ giving us their Hands in a friendly manner, expressing their great satis∣faction in our Visit; and being come by the Porch, and meeting several persons of the Family, I was moved to turn about, and to exhort them, in the presence of the rest, to keep to Christ, that had given them a sense of the Spirit of this World, and had raised desires in them to be delivered from it, and to know no Man after the Flesh, but to have their Fellow∣ship in Christ, Union and Commu∣nion with God, and one with ano∣ther, that all their Worship and Per∣formances might stand in him, that he might be all in all; desiring that the Lord might keep them in his fear all the days of their appointed time, that so they might serve him in their generation in his own universal Spi∣rit to his glory, who is blessed for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="99"/>The two Pastors and the Doctor came with us a Field's length, where we took Waggon; and the chiefest of them took occasion to ask me, If the Truth rose not first amongst a poor, illiterate and simple sort of people; I told him yes, that was our com∣fort, and that we owed it not to the Learning of this World: Then, said he, let not the Learning of this World be used to defend that which the Spi∣rit of God hath brought forth; for Scholars now coming among you, will be apt to mix School-learning a∣mongst your simpler and purer Lan∣guage, and thereby obscure the brightness of the Testimony: I told him it was good for us all to have a care of our own Spirits, Words and Works, confessing what he said had weight in it; telling him, it was our care to write and speak according to the divine Sense, and no humane In∣vention.</P>
<P>The Lord comforted my Soul in this service; yea, all that is within me magnified his holy Name, be∣cause
<PB N="190" REF="100"/>
of his blessed Presence that was with us! O let my Soul trust in the Lord, and confide in him for ever; O let me dwell and abide with him that is faithfull and true, and blessed for ever-more! So in a very sober and serious manner we parted, being a∣bout the 12th. hour at noon: This night about ten we got to <HI>Lippenhusen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lippen∣husen.</NOTE> where there is a little Meeting of Friends, being about 25 <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>

resorted, both Collegiant and Calvinist Students, who behaved themselves soberly; the Lord's Power was over all, and his Testimony stands.

Member of the Body in the Unity stan∣deth on the top of them, and hath a Judgment against them, unto which Judg∣ment of both great and small amongst the living Family that in the Unity are pre∣served they must bow, before they can come into the Unity again; yea, this they will readily do, if they are come into Unity with the Life and Power of God in themselves, which is the holy Root, that beareth the Tree, the Fruit and the Leaves all receiving Life and Virtue from it, and thereby are nourished un∣to God's praise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And let all have a care how they weaken that, or bring that under their exaltation and high imagination that it is revealed against: For I feel that un∣ruly Spirit is tormented under the stroke and judgment of the Power, and in its subtilty is seeking occasion against the In∣struments, by whom the Power gave it forth: Let all have a care how they touch with this Spirit in those Workings, for by being one with this Spirit in judging those that have been faithful, according to the Gift of Wisdom they have recei∣ved
<PB N="194" REF="102"/>
from God, they will feed it and for∣tifie it, and in the end come to be one with them against the power it self, and at last run out and become open Enemies and Despisers, for whom is reserved the blackness and darkness for ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wherefore all that labour for the Re∣storation of those that are out of Unity with the Brethren, let them be such as are of a sound mind themselves; Else, What will they gather from? Or, What will they gather to? And let them la∣bour in the Simplicity, Integrity, Love and Zeal of the Power that first gathe∣red us to God. For that which is right∣ly gotten will endure, but that which is obtained by the Contrivance, Interest and Perswasions of Men, getteth no farther than Man, and is of the Flesh, and what is of the Flesh is fleshly, and shall never inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore let none look out of the Seed for help, for all Power is in it, and there the true Light and Judgment stand for ever; and that Seed hath God ordained to bruise the Serpent's head. They that would save it, and those that would bruise
<PB N="195" REF="102"/>
it by any other thing, are Breakers of God's great Ordinance, and fly to</HI> Egypt <HI>for strength. For 'tis</HI> David, <HI>the Strip∣ling, that shall be too hard for</HI> Goliah <HI>the Giant, and that not by</HI> Saul<HI>'s Ar∣mour, but with God's living little stone cut out of the Mountains without hands, without Man's Invention and Contri∣vance. O this hath wrought all our mighty Works in us, and for us to this day! Wherefore let us be still, and trust and confide therein for ever. Let none look back, faint or consult, for if they do, they will darken their pure eye, and lose their way, and into the Eternal Rest of the Flocks of the Companions will never come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the Judgment given forth against this Spirit (and all those that have resisted our love and forbearance that are joined to it) must stand, and all that are out of Unity with the Judg∣ment are judged by it; therefore as all would stand before the Lord, and his People, let not this Spirit be reasoned withal; enter not into Proposals and Ar∣ticles with it, but feed it with Judg∣ment,
<PB N="196" REF="103"/>
that is God's Decree, so may the Souls that are deceived come by the right Door into the heavenly Unity. My Bre∣thren, look forwards, and lift up your Eyes, for the Fields are even white un∣to harvest up and down the Nations, re∣member the great Name of the Lord, and behold the great Work that he is do∣ing before all People; whose saving health is visiting the World, and whose eter∣nal Word and Testament must from us go forth to gather the Nations; let that, that will be unjust, be unjust still, let the Dead bury the Dead, to whose appea∣rance the King and the Kingdom of the</HI> Gen∣tiles <HI>shall bring their glory: Let us all who have received the Gift from God, wait in deep humility, to be raised up and impowered by him more and more to eye and prosecute his universal Ser∣vice in the World; which noble Work had those that are gone into the Sepa∣tion but laid deeply to heart, they would never have sat at home murmuring, fret∣ting and quarrelling against the comely and godly Order and Practice of their Brethren: But Love, Peace and Joy had
<PB N="197" REF="103"/>
filled their hearts, and not the troubler and accuser of</HI> the <HI>Brethren; who hath ope∣ned an evil Eye in them, and begotten them into a discontented self-separating mind, and this Image they bear, and the pure Eye sees it. O let none tempt the Lord! let none provoke the eye of his jea∣lousie; let us all dwell in that divine sense, that he hath begotten in us: Where our love as a fresh and pure stream will always flow to God and one another. Here all his ways are pleasantness, and all his paths are peace; for where he keepeth the House who is Prince of Peace, he will keep all in his heavenly peace. We are but as one Family, and therefore we have but one Lord and Master, we are but as one Flock, and we have but one heavenly Shepherd to hear, who goeth before us, and giveth us eternal like to follow him: And if any are offended in him or in his, it is their own fault; if faint and grow weary we are truly sorry, if through un∣watchfulness the Enemy hath enter'd, be∣gotten coldness to the Brethren, and care∣lessness of embracing the opportunity by which the Unity is renewed and increa∣sed,
<PB N="198" REF="104"/>
so that what's done by the Brethren without them, is lockt upon, first with a sleight eye, and then with an evil eye, which begets distance, and this distance in a time separation, and separation con∣tinueth enmity, and this enmity death it self: We are in our Spirits truly griev'd for them, however the Judgments of God must stand against them, and that Spirit which leadeth them, in which they gather not to God but to themselves, and woe to them, that strengthen their hands and despise counsel, they will have much to answer for before the Lord. I feel a slighting, scornful, laughing Spirit often flying at me with its venemous Sting, but the Seed of Life is over it, and the Lord God will destroy it. Wherefore Friends, in all places where the Spirit hath entrance keep sound Judgment up∣on it, if you will keep your Garments clean, and enter not into Disputes and Contests with it, 'tis that it seeketh and loveth; but go on in your Testimony and business for the Lord, in the Lord's peace∣able Power and Spirit, and his blessing and presence of Life shall be with you,
<PB N="199" REF="104"/>
and in multiplying he shall multiply you, for no good will be withhold from you, we can say it of a truth, God is good to</HI> Israel, <HI>and to all that are of an upright heart. And let us be of good chear, for 'tis God's determination, that the House of</HI> David <HI>shall grow stronger and stron∣ger, and his Branch shall encrease and spread, and of his Government, King∣dom and Dominion there shall be no end.</HI></P>

<P>We arrived at <HI>Embden</HI> about the 11<HI>th</HI> hour. This is the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Embden.</NOTE> where Friends have been so bitterly and bar∣barously used, the like hath scarcely been known in any place, where Truth hath broke forth in our day, they having here been banished some 30, and some 40 times and above. The
<PB N="200" REF="105"/>
first Family that received truth in this City was Doctor <HI>John William Haes∣baert</HI> and his Wife, at whose house also the first Meeting was set up a∣mong Friends to wait upon the Lord by way of publick Testimony: they are now both Dead, but the Memory of their Fidelity is a precious Oint∣ment among the Righteous; they were with me at a Meeting six years ago in this City, and I remember the power had that operation upon them, that I said to <HI>B F.</HI> and <HI>T R.</HI> then with me, it will not be long before they will publickly own and bear te∣stimony in this place; and about three months after he came forth, and she about a year after him; and from their fidelity and integrity, notwith∣standing all the sore and bitter tem∣pest of Persecution, a fine Meeting sprang, but at this day they are scat∣tered, being still sent away as fast as they return. We visited his Mother's Family, where we found three of his Sisters in the love of Truth, his fourth Sister being also a Friend, and is
<PB N="201" REF="105"/>
Wife of <HI>John Claus</HI> living at <HI>Amster∣dam.</HI> We had a little sweet comfor∣table Meeting with them. After it, returning to my lodging, as I was writing to Doctor <HI>Andrews,</HI> President of the Counsel of State (who is re∣ported to have been the Author of this cruelty to our Friends) a burden came upon me, my writing would not serve turn, but I must go my self, and in the fear and name of the Lord to plead the innocent and suffering cause of our Friends with him: So away we went to his house, he was at first astonished to see what manner of Men we were; but after a little time he comported himself with more kindness than we expected at his hand: I askt him if He and the Se∣nate had not received a Letter in La∣tine from an English-man about two years since concerning their Severity towards the People called <HI>Quakers?</HI> He told me he had: I replyed, I was the Man, and I was constrained in Conscience to visit him on their be∣half; and I could not see how he,

being a Common-wealth's-man and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Protestant, could persecute; I plead∣ed with the Unnaturalness, the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣christianity and Imprudence of such proceedings, and prest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earnestly, but tenderly upon him, he assaulted us with several Objecti∣ons, but, blessed be the Lord, they were mostly fictitious, and therefore easily removed and answered: He also promised me, That if I would write to the Senate a Remonstrance of the Case of our Friends, and ex∣press my Request therein, and inclose it to him, he would both present it and get it to be read, and make it appear, that he was not so much our enemy as we lookt upon him to be▪ I promised to send him some Books containing a Defence of our Princi∣ples, which were accordingly put into the hands of <HI>Eliza. Haesbert</HI> to deliver him in my name. Having taken our leave of the Old Woman and her Daughters, and a Man-friend residing in that City, and left the blessings and peace of our God a∣mongst them.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="106"/>We took Ship for <HI>Lier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lier.</HI> 17<HI>th.</HI> 2.</NOTE> where we arrived the next morning; thence we took Waggon for <HI>Bremen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bremen. <HI>7</HI>th. Month. <HI>3.18.</HI></NOTE> where we came safe, through the Lord's good∣ness the next day, where we met our Friends and Companions <HI>G. Keith</HI> and <HI>B. Burly,</HI> who were come hither some hours before us from <HI>Amster∣dam.</HI> In this City there is a work of the Lord begun, though yet ob∣scurely: We had a travel upon our spirits, that the blessed and precious Truth of our dear Lord and Master might find a place to rest its foot upon; to that purpose we wrote to two Ministers under some Suffering from their Brethren, because of their great zeal against the formality and deadness of the so called reformed Churches: This we sent by a Mer∣chant, who we formerly met at <HI>Her∣werden</HI>: With some difficulty we got to them, but the person chiefly struck at was shy to speak with us, his rea∣son was this, it was known that we were in Town, and it was one of the accusations against him, that he was
<PB N="204" REF="107"/>
a Fosterer of all the strange Religions that came through the Town: Also he was then actually under Process, and that the People that had heard of the innocency of his cause con∣ceived a prejudice against our Name, though it might be without cause; he could not at present confer with us, and said he was sorry for it with all his heart, but what we should say to his Brother should be the same as if it been said to him, to whom he re∣ferred us, however I took hold of his Arm and said, I have this Message to deliver to thee, that I may disburden my self before the Lord, which was this: Mind that which hath touched thy heart, let that guide thee, do not thou order that, consult not with Flesh and Blood, how to maintain that cause, which Flesh and Blood in thy enemies persecuteth thee for. He answered, rather than I will betray that cause or desert Christ, by Gods strength they shall pull my flesh of my bones: So he left us in his house, and truely we had a good time with his
<PB N="205" REF="107"/>
Companion the other Minister about three hours testifying unto him, that the day was come and coming in which the Lord would gather out of all Sects (that stand in the oldness of the Letter) into his own Holy Spirit, Life and Power, and in this the Unity of Faith and Bond of Peace should stand, and therefore that he and all of them should have an eye to the principle of God, that being turned to that, they might speak from it, and that therein they would Glorifie God and be edified. So we parted leaving the man in a sensible and savoury frame. We visited the Merchant twice and had a very good time with him, the man is of a loving and simple Spirit, and the Love of God opened our hearts to him often.</P>
<P>We also visited Doctor <HI>Johan So∣phrony Cozack,</HI> an odd <HI>Compositum</HI> of a man, he had great and strange open∣ings, he hath writ several hundred tracts, some of them are now printed at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> he is a great enemy to the Priests, and in society with none,
<PB N="206" REF="108"/>
of a merry yet of a rough disposition, without any method or decency in his Cloaths, Food, Furniture and Enter∣tainments; he wants but three of fourscore, yet of a wonderful Vigor and pregnancy, we were twice with him, and we have reason to think he was as loving to us as to any body, and truly he did show at parting some serious and hearty kindness; but we could fasten little upon him as to God's Power, or any inward sense of us or our testimony, yet we had little to object against what we had said, nay, some things were very extraordinary.</P>
<P>From him we went to Doctor <HI>Bel∣ingham,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Physitian a man of a lowly and tender spirit, who receiv∣ed us in much love, lamenting when we left him, that he had no more time with us. At the Inn we had fre∣quent opportunity to declare the way of Truth, and we must needs say, we were heard with patience and Sobri∣ety, particularly of a Doctor of Law who lodged at the house, and an an∣cient Man of <HI>Kiel</HI> in <HI>Holstein,</HI> we
<PB N="207" REF="108"/>
left Books amongst them all, and in the Love and Fear of God we took our leave of them on the fifth day af∣ter dinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>7</HI>th. Month. Herwer∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. <HI>7.22.</HI></NOTE> and begun our journey towards <HI>Herwerden</HI> the Court of the Princess, where we arrived on the Se∣venth day in the morning every way well, through the Mercies of the Lord. We sent to inform her of our arrival, and to know what hour it would be convenient for us to visit her, who re∣turned us this answer, that being then imployed in the business of her Go∣vernment, it would be the 2d. hour in the afternoon before she could be at leasure. The time being come we went to visit her, and found her and the Countess ready to receive us, which they did with much love and tender∣ness: I observed them to be much lower than ever, and that our former blessed opportunities had had a blessed effect upon them. That afternoon was imployed in the narrative of our tra∣vels, which they heard with great at∣tention and refreshment, the whole discourse ended with a precious little
<PB N="208" REF="109"/>
meeting. The house being clear of Strangers, they both earnestly prest us to sup with them, which being not well able to decline we submitted to. At Supper the Power of the Lord came upon me, and it was a true sup∣per to us, for the hidden <HI>Manna</HI> was manifested amongst us, yea a blessed Meeting it proved to us: O the re∣verent tenderness and lowly frame of Spirit that appeared this Evening both in the Princess and Countess. The <HI>French</HI>-woman we found greatly im∣proved both in her Love and Under∣standing, yea, she is very zealous and very broken, she was always with us on these occasions. After supper we returned to the Princesse's Chamber, where we stayed till it was about 10. at Night, at parting I desired the Prin∣cess would give us such another op∣portunity next day, being the first day of the Week, as we had the last time we were with her; she answered me, <HI>With all my heart, But will ye not come in the Morning too?</HI> I replied, <HI>Yes wil∣lingly, What time wilt thou be ready to receive us,</HI> she answered, <HI>at</HI> 7.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="109"/>About 7 the next Morning we came,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7<HI>th. Month.</HI> 8.23.</NOTE> about eight the Meeting began and held till Eleven, several Persons of the City, as well as those of her own Fa∣mily being present, The Lord's pow∣er very much affected them, and the Countess was twice much broken as we spoke. After the People were gone out of the Chamber, it lay upon me from the Lord to speak to them two, the Princess and the Countess, with respect to their particular con∣ditions, occasioned by these Words from the Countess; <HI>I am fully con∣vinc'd, but O my Sins are great.</HI> Whilst I was speaking, the glorious Power of the Lord wonderfully rose, yea, af∣ter an awful manner, and had a deep entrance upon their Spirits, especial∣ly the Countesse's, that she was bro∣ken to pieces, God hath raised, and I hope fixt his own Testimony in them.</P>
<P>We returned to our Inn, and after dinner we came back to the second Meeting on that day, which began about the second Hour in the after∣noon:
<PB N="210" REF="110"/>
And truly the Reverent, Bles∣sed, Sure Word of Life was divided a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣right, the precious sense of Truth was raised in the Meeting; There came more of the City than in the morn∣ing, and we were much comforted in the Lord's power that was with us. For the Truth had passage, and the hungry were satisfied, and the sim∣ple-hearted deeply affected: This day at both Meetings was one of the Princess's Women, that never was at Meeting before, and she (though ve∣ry shy of us the last time) became tender and loving to us, she was tru∣ly reacht. O, magnified be the Name of the Lord, whose presence was with us, and whose arm stood by us. Af∣ter Meeting the Princess prest us to stay and sup with her, pleading the quietness of the Family, and that they were alone; At Supper (as the night before) it was upon me to commemo∣rate the Goodness of the Lord, his daily Providences, and how pretious he is in the Covenant of Light to the dear Children, and Followers of the
<PB N="211" REF="110"/>
Light. Great was the reverence and tenderness that was upon the Spirits of both Princess and Countess at that instant. After Supper we returned to the Princess's Chamber, where we spent the rest of our time in holy si∣lence or discourse, till about the tenth hour, and then we repaired to our Quarters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">7<HI>th. Month.</HI> 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Next morning about eight we re∣turned to the Court, where the Prin∣cess and Countess were ready to re∣ceive us. The morning was imploy∣ed in very serious Conference, rela∣ting to the affairs, practice and suffer∣ings of Friends in <HI>England,</HI> with which they seemed greatly affected: When about the Eleventh Hour a ratling of Coach interrupted us. The Coun∣tess immediately stept out to see what was the matter, and returned with a countenance somewhat uneasie, tel∣ling us, that the young Princes, Ne∣phews to the Princess and the Graef of <HI>Donaw,</HI> were come to visit her; upon which I told them, we should withdraw, and return to our Lodg∣ing;
<PB N="212" REF="111"/>
but intreated, that for as much as we were to depart that night with the Post-Waggon, we might not be disappointed of a farewell Meeting with them; and the rather, for that I had a great burden upon my Spi∣rit, which they readily complied with, telling me, these persons would onely dine and be gone. As we went to the door, the Countess stept be∣fore us, and opened it for us; and as I past by, she lookt upon me with a weighty countenance, and fetcht a deep sigh, crying out, O the cum∣ber and entanglements of this vain World! they hinder all good; Upon which I replied, looking her stead∣fastly in the face, O come thou out of them then.</P>
<P>After we had dined in our Lodg∣ing, something being upon me to write to the Professors of that Coun∣try, I went up to my Chamber that I might be the more retired; just as I was about the conclusion of the Paper, cometh the Steward of the House to the Princess, with this Mes∣sage,
<PB N="213" REF="111"/>
That the Princess intreated us to come to her, for the Graef of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣naw</HI> had a great desire to see us, and to speak with us; this brought a fresh Weight and Exercise upon us; but committing all to the Lord, and casting our care upon him, we went.</P>
<P>Being arrived, the Graef approach∣eth us in <HI>French</HI>; at first took no great notice of our inceremonious be∣haviour, but proceeded to inquire of us our success in our Journey, and what we found answering our Jour∣ney and Inclinations. Then we fell to points of Religion, and the Nature and End of true Christianity, and what was the way that leadeth to the Eternal Rest. After some short de∣bate about compleat satisfaction in this life, we both agreed that Self∣denial, Mortification and Victory was the Duty, and ought to be the en∣deavour of every sincere Christian.</P>
<P>From this I fell to give him some account of my Retreat from the World, and the inducements I had thereto, and the necessity of an inward work,
<PB N="214" REF="112"/>
with which he seemed much pleased. After this he fell to the Hat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This choaketh; and the rather, because it telleth tales; it telleth what people are; it marketh Men for Separatists; it's blowing a Trumpet, and visibly crossing the World, and that the fear of Man (greatly prevalent with too many serious people in that Land) cannot abide, starteth at, and run∣neth away from him; howbeit the Lord enabled me to open the thing to him, as that it was no plant of God's planting, but a weed of Dege∣neracy and Apostacy, a carnal and earthly Honour, the effect, feeder and pleaser of pride and of a vain mind, that no advantage redounded to mankind by it; and how could they that ought to do all to the glory of God, use that vain and unprofitable custom, which cannot be done to the glory of God. I intreated him seri∣ously to consider with himself the rise and end of it, whence it came, whom it pleased, and what that was that was angry that it had it not? I
<PB N="215" REF="112"/>
also told him of the sincere and ser∣viceable respect which Truth substitu∣teth in place thereof, and exhorted him to Simplicity and Poverty of Spirit, to believe that Jesus he pro∣fessed to be his Saviour, whose out∣side as well as Doctrine pleased not the Jews, and so we parted; he took his leave of the Princess, and then of us with great Civility.</P>
<P>After he was gone, the Princess desired us to withdraw to her Cham∣ber, and there we began our farewell Meeting; the thing lay weighty up∣on me, and that in the deep dread of the Lord: and eternally magnified be the Name of the Lord that over∣shaddowed us with his Glory; his heavenly, breaking, dissolving Power richly flowed amongst us, and his ministring Angel of Life was in the midst of us: Let my Soul never forget the Divine Sense that over∣whelmed all, at that blessed farewell I took of them much opened in me of the Hour of Christ's Temptation, his Watchfulness, Perseverance and
<PB N="216" REF="113"/>
Victory: about the ten Virgins, what the true Virgin was, the true Oyl and Lamp; what the Bride-groom, his Door, Chamber and Sup∣per: and in conclusion, that torrent of heavenly melting Love that we were all deeply affected; I fell on my Knees, recommending them un∣to the Lord, crying with strong Cries for their Preservation, and beseeched the Lord's Presence with us, and so ended.</P>
<P>After some pause, I went to the Princess and took her by the hand, which she received and embraced with great signs of a weighty kind∣ness, being much broken, I spoke a few words apart to her, and left the Blessing and Peace of Jesus with and upon her. Then I went to the Coun∣tess, and left a particular Exhortation with her, who fervently beseeched me to remember and implore the Lord on her behalf. From her I went to the French-woman, and bid her be faithful and constant to that which she knew; she was exceedingly bro∣ken,
<PB N="217" REF="113"/>
and took an affectionate and reverent Leave of us.</P>
<P>Then I spoke to the rest, and took leave severally of them; my Compa∣nions did all the like. They fol∣lowed us to the outward Room, and there it was upon me to step to the Countess, and once more to speak to her and take my leave of her, which she received and returned with great Sense, Humility and Love. So turning to them all, my Heart and Eye to the Lord, I prayed that the Fear, Presence, Love and Life of God, with all heavenly Blessings, might descend and rest with and upon them then and for ever.</P>
<P>Home we went for our Lodging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7<HI>th. Month.</HI> 3.25.4.26.</NOTE> clear'd the House, exhorted the Fa∣mily, left Books, and then took Waggon for <HI>Wesel</HI> about 200 English Miles from <HI>Herwerden,</HI> we rid three Nights and Days without lying down on a Bed, or sleeping, other∣wise than in the Waggon, which was only covered with an old ragged Sheet; the Company we had with
<PB N="218" REF="114"/>
us made Twelve in number, which much streightned us; they were often, if not always Vain, yea, in their re∣ligious Songs, which is the fashion of that Country, especially by Night, they call them <HI>Luther</HI>'s <HI>Songs,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Psalms:</HI> We were forced often to reprove and testify against their Hypocrisy, to be full of all vain and often prophane Talk one hour, and sing Psalms to God the next; we shewed them the Deceit and Abomination of it. We passed through several great Towns by the way, as <HI>Lipstad, Ham,</HI> &amp;c. many Discourses we had of Truth, and the Religion and Worship that was truly Christian, and all was very well; they bore what we said. But one thing was remarkable that may not be omitted. I had not been six hours in the Waggon, before an heavy weight and unusual oppression fell upon me, yea, it weighed me almost to the Grave, that I could almost say, <HI>My Soul was sad even unto Death</HI>; I knew not at present the Ground of
<PB N="219" REF="114"/>
this Exercise, it remained about 24 hours upon me; then it opened in me that it was a travel for the Seed, that it might arise over all in them I had left behind, and that nothing might be lost but the Son of Perdi∣tion. O the strong Cries and deep Agonies, many Tears and sincere bowings and humblings of Soul be∣fore the Lord, that this holy sense which was raised in them, might be preserved alive in them, and they for ever in it, that they might grow and spread as heavenly Plants of Righte∣ousness to the glory of the Name of the Lord.</P>

<P>O That thou mayest for ever dwell in the sweet and tender Sense of that divine Love and Life which hath visited thy Soul, affected and overcome thy heart: O tell me, hath it not some∣times raised thy Spirit above the World, and fill'd thee with fervent and passio∣nate desires, yea, holy resolution to fol∣low Jesus thy blessed Saviour; who hath given his most precious Blood for Thee, that thou shouldest not live to thy self, but to him that hath so dearly purchased thee, O the Retired, Humble, Reverent Frame that I have beheld thee in, when this blessed life hath drawn thee into it self, and adorned and seasoned thee with its own heavenly Vertue; beautifying thy very Countenance beyond all the vain and foolish Ornaments of the wanton Daughters of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> (for therein are Charms not known to the

is not greater than his Master, nor the Servant than his Lord; if you were of the World, the World would love you, and not reproach and persecute you; for the World loveth its own. O my dear Friend, mayst thou be perfectly sensible what it is not to be of this World. But there is yet a farther mystery in these Words, not discerned even of many, in whom some tenderness and inquiry is be∣gotten, much less of the worldly Christi∣ans. This World hath a false Earth and a false Heaven, a false Foundation, and a false Ioy; not only gross Wicked∣ness, but Iniquity in a Mystery inward∣ly and outwardly. The Whore, false Prophet and Dragon, and all their Off∣spring are here concerned: This is their World, that must be burnt with fire, that Christ is not of, nor his true Disciples. O the Light of Jesus dis∣covereth it! And he is that spiritual <HI>Solomon</HI> that giveth true judgment, and that saveth the living Child, the true Birth, giving it to the right Mother, and not to the false pretender. And all that hear his voice and follow him, shall
<PB N="225" REF="117"/>
receive true Light, discerning and Judg∣ment, to whom all Judgment is given: They shall know his Voice from Man's.</P>
<P>There are two Trees of differing Na∣tures have contrary Fruits and Leaves, the one is the Tree of Life, that is Christ, the other the Tree of Death, and that is Satan, the fruit of the one giveth life, the fruit of the other brin∣geth Death; the leaves of the first Heal, the leaves of the last Poison, many that discern the Tree cannot clearly distin∣guish the Branches: And those that see many Arms and Branches cannot distinct∣ly behold the fruit, much less the leaves, this cometh by the gradual Discoveries and Revelations of the Light of Jesus, the Word of God, as it is daily received, and daily obeyed; yea, and that Word is the Ax and Sword of the Almighty to cut it down, daily feel the strokes of this eternal searching Light and Word at the very root of this corrupt Tree, this evil one, and his corrupt Nature, Works and Effects, for which end Jesus Christ is come, and therefore is called a Saviour, which is little known in truth to the Christians of

this World. Ah, my dear Friend, thou knowest this Word, yea, thou hast fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, O hide it in thy heart! Treasure it up it up in thy Soul and love it, and a∣bide with it for ever. Alas! Whether shouldst thou go? This hath, and is the the Word of Eternal Life, daily there∣fore watch and wait that thou mayest be grafted more and more into it, that thou mayest live and grow by the virtue and life of it, and that it may grow in thy heart, as it grew among the first Chri∣stians, the holy followers of the persecu∣ted Jesus; and when it searcheth thy Wound, and cutteth away thy dead flesh, yea, when it separateth between the Soul and the Spirit of this World, and divi∣deth between Joints and Marrow, when it cutteth off the right hand, and pluck∣eth out the right eye. O watch unto Prayer, and pray that thou mayest en∣dure! O keep the holy patience of this pure and living Word, and this very Word will keep thee in the hour of thy sharpest Trials and sorest Tribulations! O all virtue is in it! O 'tis a tried Word, a sure refuge, the staff and strength

of the Righteous in all Ages. 'Twas <HI>David</HI>'s Teacher and Buckler, a Light to his feet, and a Lamhorn to his Paths, Walk thou in the Light thereof, and thou shalt not stumble; in this word is life, as in the root, and this life is the Light of Men: They that receive and love the Light of it, will therein receive divine Life from it to live to God, this is the bread of God, that cometh from God, and seedeth and leadeth up to God, by this only that which is born of God liveth, and is nourished; this is that Carcass to which the wise Eagles gather, see thou gatherest to no other, nor fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dest on no other. This is that hidden <HI>Manna</HI> that cometh from heaven that feedeth God's <HI>Israel;</HI> the World hath a <HI>Manna</HI> but it perisheth, but this endureth for ever, for 'tis not of Man nor from Man but immortal and from God, hid from the knowledge of all the vain Christians in the World: So that the <HI>Israel</HI> of God can say to the Children of this World, and that in Truth and Righteousness, we have a Bread you know not of. For this <HI>Manna</HI> wait daily that thou mayst be
<PB N="228" REF="119"/>
strengthened in thy wilderness-travel to the Land of Eternal Rest. Wherefore labour not for the Bread that perisheth, that is the Bread of Man's inventing and making, which cometh from below, and profiteth not, because it giveth not life eternal. But labour thou (my dear Friend) for the Bread that never perish∣eth, that endureth for ever, and that giveth life eternal to all that feed upon it. O cast thy care upon this Word, love it, and dwell with it, wait daily upon it, hear its Voice only and follow it, for it bringeth the Soul to the eternal Habita∣tion of rest and glory. Yea, when all Flesh wither, and the beauty thereof fade away, this Word, and they that are graf∣ted in shall abide for ever. O that this may be thy choice, and it shall be thy Diadem, and thy Eternal Crown and Glory.</P>
<P>These are the fervent desires, and these the daily prayers of my Soul to the God of my Salvation for thee, not only that nothing in thee may be lost besides the Son of Perdition: But that thou mayst cast off every weight and burden,
<PB N="229" REF="119"/>
and that Sin that doth so easily be-set thee, that grieveth, boweth and oppresseth thee: Under the heavy weight of which thou groanest and sighest that the Re∣deemer would come from <HI>Zion</HI> to deli∣ver thee. O give not heed to the Ene∣my, the false accuser, that seeketh to de∣vour that which is begotten of God in thee, neither look upon thy own Sins, Burdens, or Weaknesses, but lift up thy head and look to Jesus, the Author of thy blessed Visitation, and wholly hun∣ger and thirst after him, the spiritual brazen Serpent that healeth and reliev∣eth all that in Faith and full Assurance look to him. Want of looking to him, hearing and obeying him, and having true faith in him, is the cause both of all the Presumption and Despair that are at this day. He did no mighty things of old in those places where they belie∣ved not. O faint not, look not back, re∣member the holy Ancients, the holy Pil∣grims of Faith, the Royal Generation of Heaven, <HI>Heb. 11.</HI> Thou believest in God, believe also in him for the Work's sake that he has already wrought in thee:
<PB N="230" REF="120"/>
He will minister to thee, as he was mi∣nistred unto by his Father's Angel in the Hour of his Abasement and great Temp∣tation. O watch and be faithful, and thou shalt be a noble Witness for the Lord.</P>
<P>Once more let me expostulate with thee, would thou overcome the Enemies of thy Soul's peace, and enjoy the de∣lightful presence of the Lord with thee, then keep nothing back, let nothing be withheld that he calleth for, remember that <HI>Saul</HI> of old lost his Kingdom, for keeping that alive, which he should have slain: Thou knowest what be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> outwardly. But be thou like the poor Widow of old, that there∣fore gave more into the Treasury than all the rest, because they reserved the greatest part to themselves, but she gave all she had. O blessed are they that make no Bargains for themselves, that have no reserves for Self, neither con∣sult with Flesh and Blood, nor in any Sense conform to the least Ceremony which▪ is born of them: But that submit their Wills in all things to the Lord's, that
<PB N="231" REF="120"/>
they may be made perfect through Suf∣ferings as Christ was. Read me in the mystery of Life, I speak not of deserting or flinging away all outward Substance, but that thy Heart may reign above all Visibles, and make God its Trea∣sure, and never rest in any thing of this lower World, or short of Christ the Eternal Rest of all the Seed of Faith.

<P>THE Lord brought us well to <HI>Wesel</HI> on the fift day after we left <HI>Herwerden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>27.7</HI>th. Month.

<P>The next day we went towards <HI>Duysburgh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>28</HI>th. Duysburgh.</NOTE> we visited the <HI>Schult</HI> or Chief Governour that Night, whom we found at home, he received us with much Kindness. His Wife and
<PB N="232" REF="121"/>
Sister, we fear, have been shaken in their good belief of our Testimony, since we were last there, some Fowls of the Air have devoured the Seed that was sown. O that sweet and tender frame in which we left them the time before! however the en∣trance we had upon the Spirit of the <HI>Schult,</HI> a little consolated us. Hence we sent <HI>Maria, Martha</HI>'s Friend, a Letter, desiring him to let us have his Answer the next Night at <HI>Dussel∣dorp,</HI> inclosed to <HI>Neander,</HI> when and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere we might see him, either at <HI>Dusseldorp, Mulheim,</HI> or <HI>Duysburgh,</HI> and if it were possible, we would gladly visit the Countess of <HI>Bruch.</HI></P>
<P>We got early to <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>29</HI>th. Dusseldorp.</NOTE> next day, being the last day of the Week: but <HI>Neander</HI> was gone to <HI>Mulheim,</HI> in order to Preach on the Morrow; so that we were disappointed of our Intelligence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.30. <HI>Ceulen.</HI></NOTE>Next Morning we went towards <HI>Ceulen,</HI> and there arrived that Even∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="121"/>The next day we had a good op∣portunity with <HI>van Durando</HI> and <HI>Do∣cemius</HI> at the House of the latter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.1. 8</HI>th. Month.

The Meet∣ing done, they went away, but <HI>Ne∣ander</HI> returned, and first of our Let∣ter to <HI>Mulheim,</HI> we found by him (as also at our return to <HI>Duysburgh</HI>) that <HI>Kuper</HI> was so far from endea∣vouring ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> visit to the Countess, that he would not meet us himself neither at <HI>Dusseldorp, Mullheim,</HI> nor <HI>Duysburgh:</HI> nay, it did not please him to send us an Answer, much less any the least Salutation, I confess it grieved us. Now for <HI>Neander,</HI> the Young man hath a Zeal for God, and there is a Visitation upon him, my Soul desireth that it may not be ineffectual: but I have a great fear
<PB N="234" REF="122"/>
upon me, for this I know certainly from the Lord God that liveth for ever, and I have a Cloud of Wit∣nesses to my Brethren, that Retire∣ment and Silence before God, is the alone way for him to feel the hea∣venly gift to arise, and come forth pure and unmixt; this only can preach for God, pray to God, and beget People to God, and nothing else. But alas, his office in that Fa∣mily is quite another thing; namely to perform Set Duties of fixt times, Pray, Preach, and Sing, and that in the way of the World's Appoint∣ments. His very office is <HI>Babylonish,</HI> namely, a Chaplain; for 'tis a Popish Invention: In the good old times, Godly <HI>Abraham</HI> that was a Prince, and <HI>Joshua</HI> a great General, and <HI>Da∣vid</HI> a King, with many more, in∣structed their Families in the know∣ledge and fear of God: But now People are too Idle or too Great to pray for themselves, and so they worship God by Proxy. How can a Minister of the Gospel be at the
<PB N="235" REF="122"/>
beck of any Mortal living, or give his Soul and Conscience to the time and appointment of another? the thing in it self is utterly wrong, and against the very Nature and Worship of the new and everlasting Covenant. You had better meet to read the Scriptures, the Book of Martyrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if you cannot sit and wait in silence upon the Lord, till his Angel move upon your Hearts, than to uphold such a formal, limited and ceremo∣nious, Worship: this is not the Way out of <HI>Babylon.</HI> And I have a deep sense upon my Soul, that if the Young Man strive beyond the talent God hath given him to answer his Office and fill up his Place, and wait not for the pure and living Word of God in his Heart to open his Mouth, but either studieth for his Sermons or speaketh his own Words, he will be utterly ruined. Wherefore, O Dear Friend, have a care thou art no Snare to him, nor he to thee: Man's Works smother and stifle the true life of Christ, what have you to do but
<PB N="236" REF="123"/>
to look to Jesus the Author of the holy desires that are in you, who himself hath visited you, tempt not the Lord, provoke not God, what should any Man Preach from, but Christ? and what should he Preach people too, but Christ in them the hope of Glory? Consider nothing feedeth, that which is born of God, but that which cometh down from God, even the Bread of God which is the Son of God, which giveth his life for the World, feel it and feed on it, let none mock God nor grieve his eternal Spirit that is come to seal them up from the mouth of Man that hath deceived them: that Jesus the anointing may teach them and abide with them for ever. Be sted∣fast and immoveable, and this will draw the Young Man near to the Lord, and empty him of himself and purge away mixtures, and then you will all come to the Divine Si∣lence: and when all Flesh is silent before the Lord, then is it the Lord's time to Speak, and if you will hear

your Souls shall live. O my Soul is in great pain, that you may be all chastly preserved in that divine Sense begotten in your Hearts by the eter∣nal Word of God that abideth for ever, that nothing may ever be able to extinguish it. But more especially thou, my Dear Friend, mayest be kept in faithfulness: for the Lord is come very near to thee and thou must begin the Work, the Lord God ex∣pecteth it at thy hand: if one Sheep break through the rest will follow; wherefore watch, O watch, that thou may'st be strengthned and confirmed, and strengthen all that is begotten of God in that Family, by thy weighty, savoury and circumspect life. O how is my Soul affected with thy present condition! it is the fervent Suppli∣cation of my heart, that thou may'st through the daily obedience of the Cross of Jesus, conquer and shine as a bright and glorious Star in the Firmament of God's eternal Kingdom: So let it be, Lord Jesus. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

Thy Brother in Law's two Sisters were present, we stayed with them at least two Hours. Many Que∣stions she put to me, which I was glad to have an Opportunity to Answer, for it made way for a Meeting; she intreated us to come again if we stayed, and told us, our Visit was very grateful to her;

<P>This done, and having left Books both there and with thy Sister, we left <HI>Wesel</HI> with Hearts full of Joy and Peace: and let me say this, That more kindness, more openness, we have scarcely found in all our Travels.

O Dear Friend, let us live and remember one another (now absent) in that Divine Sense in which the Lord God dissolv'd our Spirits when together.

<P><PB N="249" REF="129"/>The same day we had a blessed Publick Meeting never to be for∣gotten, O the Majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8<HI>th. Month.</HI> 4.10.</NOTE> Glory and Life that the Lord attended us with, our Hearts were deeply affe∣cted with his Presence; great Re∣verence and Brokenness was over the Meeting, more than I had seen. The Meeting done, we were op∣posed by a Preacher, who was closely encountred and pursued by several Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (not of us) that cryed <HI>he was Rude and Ignorant,</HI> and that they had <HI>a Testimony for us,</HI> who offered to Dispute in our Defence; but the Priest run away, they followed him till they housed him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It was upon me this day to en∣gage <HI>Galenus Abrahams</HI> to a second Conference, that we might more fully debate and confute his grand Objections against the present Dis∣pensation of Truth, and the hea∣venly Ministry witnessed among Friends: he refused not my offer
<PB N="250" REF="130"/>
of a second Meeting; but sent me word, his Business would not give him leave to let it be any time this day, upon which the next was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixt for the Conference to begin at Eight, which accordingly it did, and held till One.<NOTE PLACE="marg">5.11.</NOTE> The most impartial ac∣count of both these Conferences that I am briefly able to give fol∣loweth.</P>
<P>The Meeting ended, and having refresht our selves, after a solemn leave taken of our dear Friends at <HI>Amsterdam, G. F.</HI> and I, went that Night to <HI>Leyden,,</HI> accompanied by <HI>B. Furly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leyden.</NOTE> coming there late at Night, we forbore to inquire after any wor∣thy in that place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8<HI>th. Month.</HI> 6.12.</NOTE>But the next Morning we found out two, one a <HI>German</HI> of, or near <HI>Darmstad,</HI> who not only express'd much love to the Principle of Truth, and unto us the Friends thereof; but also informed us of a retired Person of great Quality that liveth about two hours back again
<PB N="251" REF="130"/>
towards <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> at a Village cal∣led <HI>Nortwyck.</HI> Our Resolutions of being that Night at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and having the <HI>Hague</HI> to Visit by the way, made our return at that time unpracticable; however the Rela∣tion of the <HI>German</HI> concerning the good Inclinations of the great Man and his Wife, their disdain of the World, voluntary retreat from the Greatness and Glory of it rested strongly upon our Spirits. This Person presently conducted us to the House of one who had for∣merly been a Doctor in the Uni∣versity, and there left us: To this Person both <HI>G. F.</HI> and my self were more than ordinarily open, he was of a sweet, yet quick, wise, yet very loving and tender Spirit; there were few Strangers we felt greater love to; He assented to every thing we said, and truly his Understanding was very clear and open to the things that lay upon us to declare, and express'd his
<PB N="252" REF="131"/>
firm Belief of great Revolutions at hand, and that they should termi∣nate in the setting up of the glo∣rious Kingdom of Christ in the World. What shall I say, the Man felt our Spirits and therefore loved us, and in the fresh sense of that love, writ a Letter by us to a re∣tired P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson at the <HI>Hague</HI> like him∣self; which in several places of <HI>Germany</HI> was the way whereby we found out several of the retired People we visited: After near two Hours time with him, we took Waggon for the <HI>Hague,</HI> leaving the Peace of God upon him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hague.</NOTE>The first thing we did there was to enquire out the Lady <HI>Overkirk</HI> a Person of a retired and religious Character, separated from the pub∣lick Worship of that Country: She was a home, but her Husband with her, being a great Man of the Army of another Disposition and Way of Living, hindred our Access at that time.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="131"/>The next Person we went to was a Judge at the Law of Chief Court of Justice in that Republick, he re∣ceived us with great Respect, and a more than ordinary desire to know the truth of our Faith and Princi∣ples: We declared of the things most surely believed amongst us in the Power and Love of God: He made his Observations, Objections, and Queries upon several things we spake, to whom we replied, and ex∣plained all Mattters in question, in∣somuch that he declared himself sa∣tisfied in our Confessions, and his good Belief of us and our Principles: We took a solemn and sensible leave of him, and we felt the Witness reacht, and his Spirit tendred, which filled our hearts with dear love to him; he brought us to his Street∣door, and there we parted.</P>
<P>From him we went to visit that Person for whom we had a Letter from the Dr. at <HI>Leyden,</HI> but he was not at home. We immediately took
<PB N="254" REF="132"/>
Waggon for <HI>Delft,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Delft. Rotterdam.</NOTE> and from thence an Express-Boat for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where we arrived well about Eight at Night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8<HI>th. Month.</HI> 7.13.</NOTE>The next day was mostly spent in visiting of Friends, and the friend∣ly People in that place, which con∣sisted of several Persons of worldly Note.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8<HI>th. Month.</HI> 1.14.</NOTE>The next day being the first Day of the Week, we had a large and blessed Meeting, wherein the deep Mysteries of the Kingdom of Christ and Antichrist were declared in the power of an endless Life. Several of divers Religions were there, but no Disturbance and Contradiction, but a profound Silence and reverent Atten∣tion were over the Meeting.</P>
<P>That Night I had a blessed Meet∣ing at my Lodging with those Per∣sons of Note, that at sometimes vi∣sited our publick Meetings, as at that day, and have a Convincement upon them: The Lord's Love, Truth and Life preciously reached towards
<PB N="255" REF="132"/>
them, and they were very sweetly af∣fected.</P>
<P>Next day I bestowed in perfect∣ing and correcting several publick Letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.15.</NOTE> which I was moved to write both in my first and second Jour∣ney in <HI>Germany,</HI> and after my return to these <HI>Low-Countries</HI>: They are left behind to be Translated and Printed; they are omitted here, be∣cause they are large and likely to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereafter printed in English. The Titles whereof follow,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>A Summons to</HI> Christendom <HI>in an earnest Expostulation with her, to prepare for the great and notable Day of the Lord that is at the door.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To all those who are sensible of the Day of their Visitation, and who have received the Call of the LORD by the Light and Spirit of his Son in their Hearts, to par∣take

<P N="3">III. <HI>To all those Professors of Christianity, that are Externally se∣parated from the visible Sects and Fellowships in the Christian World, (so called) wherever hidden or scat∣tered; true Knowledge, which is Life Eternal from God the Father by Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>A tender Visitation in the Love of God that over-cometh the World, to all People in the</HI> High <HI>and</HI> Low-Dutch <HI>Nations, who hunger and thirst after Righteous∣ness,

and desire to know and wor∣ship God in Truth, and in Sinceri∣ty, containing a plain Testimony to the Ancient and Apostolical Life, Way and Worship that God is revi∣ving and exalting in the Earth in his Spirit and Truth.</HI></P>
<P>The sense of the serious retreat of this great Man we heard of at <HI>Lei∣den</HI> was so strong upon me, that I could not see my self clear to leave the Country, before I had given him a Visit. I purposed therefore the next Morning to set forward to the <HI>Hague,</HI> from thence to <HI>Leiden,</HI> and so to <HI>Nortwyck.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>8</HI>th. Month. Nortwyck.</NOTE></P>
<P>I arrived there in the Evening with <HI>B F. A Sonnemans</HI> and <HI>M Sonne∣mans,</HI> and immediately made known our coming, and the end of it to him and his Wife, by the means of the young <HI>German,</HI> who was got thither before us to visit them. An
<PB N="258" REF="134"/>
Invitation came to us all at our Inn, and immediately we repaired to his House, which was very stately, and yet plain; he presently came to us, took us by the hand, and bid us heartily welcome. We immediate∣ly sate down, and after some time of retirement, I spoke something of what was upon me, yet not before he had given us a sober and patheti∣cal Account of his Life, and of the present frame and disposition of his Spirit. All this was in the absence of his Wife; but so soon as I had fi∣nisht what was then upon me to speak of the Witness of God, and of its Work in Man, upon the occasi∣on of the History he gave us of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; he led us into another Room, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Wife was, he told her here were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christian Friends come to vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t her, she saluted us very kind∣ly.</P>
<P>We all sat down, and after some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence, the heavenly Power of God did in a living and tender manner
<PB N="259" REF="134"/>
open their States and Conditions to me, and opened my Mouth to them; the substance of my Testimony was to this purpose, That Death reign∣ed from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses, Moses</HI> was till the Prophets, the Prophets till <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> till Christ: What Christ's day was, how few see this day; and whilst People are talking of be∣ing in Christ under Grace, and not under the Law, Death reigneth over them, and they are not come to <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> nor the shaking Mountain, the Thundrings, Lightnings and Whirl∣winds, and what it was that led to Christ, and what it was to be in him, and under the Government of his Grace; directing them to the blessed Principle of Light and Truth and Grace, which God had shed a∣broad in our hearts. I declared the nature and manner of the appearing and operating of this Principle, and appealed to their own Consciences for the truth of what was said: And I can truly say the holy Life
<PB N="260" REF="135"/>
of Jesus was revealed amongst us, and like Oil swom at the top of all: In this I was moved to kneel down and pray, great brokenness fell up∣on all, and that, that was before the World began, was richly manifested in us and amongst us. The Meet∣ing done, the great Man and his Wife blest us, and the work of God in our hands, saying, with tears in his eyes, <HI>My house is blessed for your sakes, and blessed be God that I ever lived to see you.</HI></P>
<P>And thus we left them, though with much difficulty, for they prest us with great earnestness both to eat and to lodge with them, and were hard to bear our refusal. They said it we was a Scandal to their house, that they should let such good people as were to go out of it; or suffer us to lodge in any other place: But we declared our pre-engagement else∣where, and that it was not for want of true kindness towards them. One passage I had almost forgot to men∣tion,
<PB N="261" REF="135"/>
I was (<HI>said he</HI>) once at table with the Duke of <HI>Holsteyn</HI> at <HI>Frede∣rickstadt,</HI> when the Magistrates came to complain against a people called <HI>Quakers</HI> in that City. The Duke was ready to be prejudiced against them, but at the very naming of them I conceived a more than ordi∣nary kindness in my mind towards them. I askt the Magistrate what they were for a People, he told me that they would not pull off their hats to their Superiors; I askt him whether they would pull off their hats to God, he said, yes; said I, that may be the reason why they will not pull them off to Man. Do they live peaceably? Yes, Do they pay their Taxes? Yes, Do they rub their hats in your eyes? No, Do they do any harm with them? No, Why what is your Quarrel then; not they meet in silence, and they will speak or pray unless they be moved by the Spirit; why, that is according to the Doctrine of Scripture: If this
<PB N="262" REF="136"/>
be to be a Quaker, I would I were a <HI>Quaker</HI> too, but, said he, I never saw one before, but I bless God I see you now. He very much in∣veighed against the false Christiani∣ty that is in the World, and greatly magnified a tender, mortified and re∣tired Estate. I have great hopes he and his Wife will eye the truth. We returned to our Inn to supper, and to bed.</P>

<P>The next day being the sixth day of the Week, we had a very blessed publick Meeting, taking therein our leave of the Country; and after that was done we had another amongst Friends, recommending to them the peaceable, tender, righteous Truth, desiring that they might live and grow in it, and be a People to the Lord's praise; so should his Work prosper, his Dominion enlarge and encrease among them.

O that you may be faithful and fervent for the Lord, that his glorious life and power may break thro' you. And these Lands long dry and barren, as the Wilderness may spring and blossom as the Rose.

A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is worthy, my Spirit reverenceth him, my Heart and Soul do bow before him, eternal Blessings dwell for ever with him.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, my love followeth to you as a fountain, God, even my God, and your God hath made you dear to me, yea, dearer than all natural Kindred. You are Flesh of Flesh indeed, Sea nor Land, Time nor Place can never sepa∣rate our Joy, divide our Communion, or wipe out the remembrance that I have of you; yea, the living Remembrance that my God often giveth me of you in the life of his Son abideth; which break∣eth my heart to pieces, and I can say I have left most of my heart behind me, and the Lord only could have outward∣ly separated me so soon from you. O this Love that is stronger than Death, more excellent than the love of▪ Women that endureth for ever; this Privilege have all the Saints. Jesus the light of the World that saveth from the World, be with you, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="145"/>We got well last night about Seven to <HI>Harwich,</HI> being three days and two Nights at Sea: Most part of the time was a great storm of Wind, and Rain, and Hail, the We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther was against us, and the Vessel so leaky, that two Pumps went night and day, or we ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perisht, 'tis believed that they pumpt twice more water out than the Vessel could contain, but our peace was as a River, and our joy full.

<P>But it is observable that though the Lord so wonderfully delivered us, yet some vain People soon forgot it, and re∣turned quickly to their wanton Talk and Conversation, not abiding in the sense of that hand which had delivered them, nor can any do it as they should, but those that are turned to his appearance in their hearts, who know him to be a

<P>MAny <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Weeks,</HI> yea, some <HI>Months</HI> hath my <HI>Heart</HI> been <HI>Heavy,</HI> and my <HI>Soul unusually Sad</HI> for the sake of this <HI>Nation,</HI> the <HI>Land</HI> of our <HI>Nativity!</HI> For I have not only long beheld with a grieved Eye the many <HI>Abominations</HI> and gross <HI>Impie∣ties</HI> that reign therein, the <HI>Lusts, Plea∣sures, Wantonness, Drunkenness, Whore∣doms, Oaths, Blasphemies, Envy, Trea∣chery</HI> and <HI>Persecution of the Just,</HI> but
<PB N="284" REF="148"/>
for some time I have had a deep Sense, that the <HI>Overflowing Scourge</HI> of God's <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Indignation</HI> was just ready to break out upon the People, <HI>Con∣fusion Amazement</HI> and <HI>Misery!</HI> The Weight of which hath caused me to Cry within my self, <HI>Who shall Save us!

<P>My <HI>Friends,</HI> whilst the Sense of this <HI>Distress,</HI> that is coming as a <HI>Dreadful Visitation</HI> from the Hand of the <HI>Displeased</HI> God upon this <HI>Ungodly Land</HI> to <HI>Stain its Glory, Bring down its Pride</HI> and <HI>Punish its Forgetfulness of the Lord and his many Deliverances,</HI> lay so Heavy upon my Spirit, the Lord pre∣sented before me all the Truly <HI>Con∣scientious</HI>

<P>Wherefore in the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI> be ye all <HI>dis-incumbred of the World</HI> and <HI>discharged</HI> of the <HI>Cares</HI> of it; Fly as for your Lives from the <HI>Snares</HI> therein, and get you into your <HI>Watch-Tower,</HI> the NAME of the LORD!

<P>And <HI>Lastly,</HI> my <HI>Dear Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> by how much this <HI>Day</HI> draws Nigh, by so much the more do ye <HI>Stand loose</HI> in your <HI>Affections</HI> to the World, but <HI>fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> in the <HI>Faith.</HI> And <HI>Assemble</HI> your selves together, and let God <HI>Arise</HI> in you, and his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> among you, that ye may not only Wrestle, but in the End <HI>Prevail</HI>; That it may be seen, that SALVATION <HI>is of the Jews,</HI> the <HI>Jews Inward,</HI> in <HI>Spirit</HI> and in <HI>Truth:</HI> And truly, the time hastens, that <HI>Ten</HI> shall take hold of the <HI>Skirt</HI> of such a <HI>Jew,</HI> and they shall be <HI>saved.</HI> But <HI>Wo</HI> to the <HI>Hypocrite</HI> in that Day, the <HI>For∣malist,</HI> the <HI>Jew Outward,</HI> the <HI>Cir∣cumcision in the Flesh</HI> and Fleshly <HI>Christian,</HI> that cannot Resist the <HI>Temp∣tations</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="151"/>
of this World, the <HI>Tempori∣zer,</HI> one that <HI>Runs with the Tide,</HI> he will be <HI>Divided.</HI> For there will be more <HI>Tides,</HI> more <HI>Interests</HI> on Foot at once, than One; wherefore <HI>Per∣plexity</HI> will take hold on him, his <HI>Policy</HI> will be <HI>Confounded.</HI> He will not know what to do to be <HI>Safe,</HI> nor what to <HI>Joyn</HI> with; this <HI>Double-minded Man</HI> will be <HI>Unstable</HI> in his Counsels and in his Actions, his <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> will be <HI>Shaken.</HI> Therefore, as I said, <HI>Wo</HI> to the <HI>Hy∣pocrite,</HI> and to the <HI>Covetous Man</HI> too, for his Gods will fail him; the <HI>Thief,</HI> the <HI>Moth</HI> and <HI>Rust</HI> will invade his Baggs and surprise his Treasure: his <HI>Anguish</HI> will be <HI>Great</HI> in this Day! But my <HI>Dear Brethren,</HI> as the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord God will Preserve and Establish us, if we <HI>Sincerely</HI> and <HI>Entirely</HI> confide there∣in, and that above our Sollicitation or Need of <HI>Carnal Consultations</HI> or <HI>Contrivances,</HI> which we have there∣fore laid aside; so shall it Vindi∣cate
<PB N="291" REF="151"/>
us in <HI>Due Time</HI> in the Eyes of all <HI>Nations,</HI> and present us a Peo∣ple owned, beloved and protected of God, in whom we have firmly believed. Nor is this <HI>Presumption,</HI> as some <HI>may think,</HI> who being not so well acquainted with that <HI>Entire Resignation</HI> and Supreme <HI>Faith</HI> (of which <HI>Jesus</HI> is the Author, that re∣moves <HI>Mountains</HI> into the <HI>Sea</HI>) con∣clude from meer <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Hu∣man Considerations</HI> against us; yet we know him in whom we have believed: and the same, that hath <HI>Cured</HI> us of our <HI>Diseases,</HI> the same said unto us, <HI>Arise and Walk in this Way of Faith; Trust in me,</HI> and not in another. And truly, this is much of that <HI>Wonder,</HI> which Men shall have in their Minds and Mouths about us in those <HI>Latter Days, In Troubles not to be dejected, and in Jeopardies not to be concerned</HI> to make to our selves <HI>Defences</HI>; but as the <HI>Lillies,</HI> that neither toil nor spin, yet feed and grow, so we may both
<PB N="292" REF="152"/>
be preserved and become <HI>Victorious</HI> without <HI>Worldly Force</HI> or <HI>Projections.</HI> For we must shew our selves to be that <HI>Little City</HI> and <HI>Hill</HI> of God, that hath only his <HI>Salvation</HI> for our <HI>Walls</HI> and <HI>Bulwarks</HI>; by whom he will renown his Arm, and magnifie his Power above the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Con∣trivances</HI> of Men. Our <HI>Weapons</HI> and our <HI>Armour</HI> is <HI>Spiritual</HI>; it hath pre∣vailed, and it will prevail, if we keep in the <HI>Faith,</HI> which was <HI>first delivered</HI> to us: a blessed <HI>Shield,</HI> by which the <HI>Just live.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, <HI>My Dear Friends,</HI> let us be Careful not to <HI>mingle with the Crowd,</HI> lest their <HI>Spirit</HI> enter us instead of our <HI>Spirit</HI> entering them, and we thereby come to fall into the same <HI>Temptations</HI> they are liable to, of <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Flying to the Hills and Mountains</HI> to protect them, confiding in the <HI>Arm</HI> of <HI>Flesh</HI> to deliver them; no, no! they must come to us, we must not go to them. Yet can we not be Unsen∣sible
<PB N="293" REF="152"/>
of their <HI>Infirmities,</HI> as well as we shall not be free from some of their <HI>Sufferings</HI>; we must make their <HI>Case</HI> as our own, and travail alike in <HI>Spirit</HI> for them, as for our selves. Let us stand in the <HI>Counsel</HI> of our God, and he will make us <HI>Preach∣ers</HI>-forth to them of the Works of his <HI>Divine Power,</HI> and the <HI>Virtue</HI> of that <HI>Faith</HI> which comes from Heaven; yea, he will make us as <HI>Saviours</HI> to the People, that they may come to know the Holy <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI> (their Crea∣tor) in their Hearts, and have their <HI>Minds</HI> and <HI>Souls</HI> turned to him, and stay'd upon them, that <HI>Iniquity</HI> may no more abound, nor <HI>Ungodli∣ness</HI> find a place: but that in <HI>Truth, Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> they may be establisht, and the Land keep its <HI>SABBATH</HI> to the <HI>Lord</HI> for ever!
