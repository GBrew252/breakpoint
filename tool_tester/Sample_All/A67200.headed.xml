<HEAD>HERO AND LEANDER. IN <HI>BURLESQUE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THe Towns of <HI>Sestus</HI> and <HI>Abidus</HI> stood</L>
<L>As near to one another as they cou'd;</L>
<L>For spightfull <HI>Hellespont</HI> still 'tween them ran,</L>
<L>Of whose outragiousness you'l hear anon:</L>
<L>Yet that they still communicated, note,</L>
<L>By floating Bridge now call'd a Ferry-boat,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Which if this year lay on <HI>Abidus's</HI> side,</L>
<L>The next to <HI>Sestian</HI> Dock was to be ty'd:</L>
<L>For Senates sage of both Towns cou'd agree</L>
<L>By turns to be the Masters of the Sea:</L>
<L>But always when <HI>Abidus</HI> had the Boat,</L>
<L>The State, and it had but the same Pylot;</L>
<L>A shrewd old Swabber with a neck a tight,</L>
<L>And evermore inclined to the right;</L>
<L>His fellow Burgers sage remark, and cause</L>
<L>Why he was chosen fisher of the Laws:</L>
<L>Besides the scituation of his ears</L>
<L>They saw was such, no trayt'rous whisperers</L>
<L>Could easily approach them, one was still</L>
<L>Prickt up to heaven to receive her will,</L>
<L>T'other did earthward lop, good man, with pain</L>
<L>To hear the needy, and oppress'd complain.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3"/>
But when you know his Education, you'l</L>
<L>Allow the man in all points fit to rule.</L>
<L>He was brought up to danger, and to rapin,</L>
<L>Dabled ith'sea, and with a line, and a pin,</L>
<L>Which the young Urchin cunningly wou'd crook,</L>
<L>With fly, or worm disguise it then, and rook</L>
<L>The Ocean of her fish; for e're a Swabber</L>
<L>He was a Sprat-catcher, or good Eele-bobber.</L>
<L><HI>Alcides</HI> when a whuleing piss-abed</L>
<L>By Poets (if you'l trust 'em) hath been sed</L>
<L>Over a thumping Adder to prevail;</L>
<L>This little Rogue cou'd hold an Eele by th'tail:</L>
<L>And with his strength his art increas'd, was able</L>
<L>Soon well to steer a Skiff, and grasp a Cable,</L>
<L>Cou'd tack about, shift sails, wheadle the wind,</L>
<L>And make it come before him, or behind:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Knew where the rocks did ly, &amp; sneaking shelves,</L>
<L>And places where bold men might drown themâˆ£selves;</L>
<L>Kenn'd Storms far off, knew whether they had more</L>
<L>A mind to come to Sea, or stay a shore:</L>
<L>But to be short, and plain, he knew as well</L>
<L>The Sea, as Beggar doth his Dish, cou'd tell</L>
<L>What the least Cockle did in's shell, and guess</L>
<L>How many arms length where 'twas bottomless;</L>
<L>Such was the man for sway, you'l think him now</L>
<L>Worthy as Roman newly ta'ne from Plow:</L>
<L>Yet know his praises I have not begun,</L>
<L>Fine Gentleman <HI>Leander</HI> was his Son,</L>
<L>With whose most gen'rous inclination he</L>
<L>To's cost (few Fathers doe so) did agree,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
And bound him Prentice to a worthy Barber,</L>
<L>The best, not such another in the harbour,</L>
<L>Unless our poor <HI>Leander</HI> had liv'd to't</L>
<L>Most probable opinion to confute.</L>
<L>He was so handy, nimble, tight, so neat</L>
<L>In's person, and his implements compleat:</L>
<L>His Towels, like his skin, were white, and fine,</L>
<L>Nought but his face his bason could out-shine;</L>
<L>So pickt, so wash't his Combes of Ivory,</L>
<L>Unless his teeth their whiteness nought came nigh,</L>
<L>With others that were made of horn, or box,</L>
<L>He often wou'd compare his golden locks;</L>
<L>With whom (if none had too much beard) he'd play,</L>
<L>And innocently sport out half the day;</L>
<L>But when you did sit down, with such a grace</L>
<L>Handled your throat, your ears, your nose, your face,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Tickled where others pain; Maids who did eye him</L>
<L>Wish'd themselves Satyrs to be trimmed by him:</L>
<L>Cou'd dive into the channels of your brain,</L>
<L>And with a feat dexterity make plain</L>
<L>The passage, though before 'twas nere so rough,</L>
<L>Yet with less pain to you, then taking snuff;</L>
<L>For he wore nails as long as bill of Bittern,</L>
<L>For that to scrape teeth, and to play on Cittern;</L>
<L>Nay he had all good qualities, cou'd tye</L>
<L>A Cuff-String, or Crevat so jantyly:</L>
<L>With all had conscience, and for copper spanker</L>
<L>Wou'd make Sea-faring beard look like an anchor.</L>
<L>For's mettle, and agility, with which</L>
<L>Writers are bound their Heroes to inrich;</L>
<L>I must confess I can't say much, but know</L>
<L>For certain he could crindge, and bow full low.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
For throwing of the Bar he never car'd,</L>
<L>Cudgels, nor wrestling, that I ever heard,</L>
<L>Or any brutish sports, which make men wrangle;</L>
<L>On Holy-days he went alone to angle;</L>
<L>Lov'd swimming well, and swam like any Duck;</L>
<L>But where most skill there ever is least luck:</L>
<L>And Arts, like women after a long wooing,</L>
<L>Oft shame our industry, and prove undoing.</L>
<L>Now towe me Muse o're to the other side,</L>
<L>Where most egregious <HI>Hero</HI> did abide;</L>
<L>You sacred Dame I mean who once did steer</L>
<L>The prosp'rous praise of great <HI>Magnanos</HI> dear;</L>
<L>If you have any time, help me ashore</L>
<L>With <HI>Heros</HI> commendation, and though poor</L>
<L>I am, in socket trimm'd with bayes I swear,</L>
<L>I'll tall rush candle to thy glory rear;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Which likewise may as <HI>Pharo</HI> serve to light</L>
<L>Your groaping Orators, when it is night,</L>
<L>Throughout <HI>Parnassus;</HI> come 'tis as folks say,</L>
<L>Who'd have his business done, must bribe, not pray.</L>
<L>What do you pause at now? I know as Muse</L>
<L>To scorn good wages was your simple use;</L>
<L>With me hang not an arse: <HI>Hero</HI> then was</L>
<L>A bonny buxom bounsing <HI>Sestian</HI> Lass,</L>
<L>Of all the Grecian Girls the very Flower,</L>
<L>Liv'd at the Towns end at the sign of Tower,</L>
<L>With her own Mother a large hearted woman,</L>
<L>Whose house to merry Greeks was alway common;</L>
<L>A comely Widow, and had long been so,</L>
<L>For th'oldest in the town did never know</L>
<L>The Father of fine <HI>Hero,</HI> whence disputes</L>
<L>That some Sea-god disguis'd in fishing boots</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>
Did catch her on the shore, &amp; there did strand her,</L>
<L>And so contriv'd a Mistress for <HI>Leander.</HI></L>
<L>But whether so, or no, or how it was,</L>
<L>She grew too great for Mortal to embrace,</L>
<L>And haughtily did stave off many proffers,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to keep the Keys of her own Coffers,</L>
<L>And scorn'd to be with any a yoke-fellow,</L>
<L>Or to admit competitor of pillow:</L>
<L>But kept the Empire of her bed to cough,</L>
<L>Snore, belch, break wind, and no one shou'd cry soh:</L>
<L>And hows'ere Love, and Lover did contrive it,</L>
<L>The cunning willful Widow did not wive it,</L>
<L>Unless she practis'd secret Matrimony,</L>
<L>For licence but for wine she had not any.</L>
<L>But what of that? I warrant she was wise</L>
<L>Enough to keep her self from Church Excise.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>
Was <HI>Hero</HI> not in spight of all the Clerg'in</L>
<L><HI>Sestus,</HI> and what they all cou'd do, a Virgin?</L>
<L>And to her Mother was but young, yet cou'd</L>
<L>Some say as much as she, nay much more did</L>
<L>Within-doors, and long of her complaisance</L>
<L>It was, her mothers liquor had good utterance.</L>
<L>For she was still in motion, now i'th'Garret,</L>
<L>And strait down in the Cellar drawing Clarret;</L>
<L>Hasty as lightning she wou'd shoot the stairs,</L>
<L>If no one did oppose her unawares;</L>
<L>Wou'd bolt into the room like startled Cunny,</L>
<L>But still dropt at the door due Ceremony;</L>
<L>Then mumpt out, Gentlemen what d'you lackâ€”</L>
<L>When strait she's answer'd with a bob, or smack:</L>
<L>But some one rising, in her ear doth tell her,</L>
<L>She answers him aloud, the best i'th'Cellar:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="7"/>
He follows down, and broaches where he will,</L>
<L>But with a gentle caution not to spill.</L>
<L>She made, and unmade beds most nimblely,</L>
<L>Not like her Dammes, hers was a slim-belly:</L>
<L>And now and then, with her sweet company</L>
<L>Cou'd satisfy gay guest for lodging high;</L>
<L>His rageing bowels supper should not miss,</L>
<L>For she cou'd stay a stomack with a kiss:</L>
<L>At coming in and out cou'd complement</L>
<L>The guests, and give 'um marvelous content.</L>
<L>For truly she well-spoken damsel was,</L>
<L>Like fav'rite Advocate brought all to pass,</L>
<L>And not as foolish Maids with nature nice,</L>
<L>But boldly us'd her own good qualities</L>
<L>Not only for her self, but other foke,</L>
<L>Cou'd break mad ranting Girls to th'marriage yoke.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="8"/>
To bashful, or dumb Lovers she was common,</L>
<L>And publick mouth, or as we say, Spokes-woman:</L>
<L>In other terms a Maidenhead-ensurer,</L>
<L>A Wife, or as it were a Wife-procurer:</L>
<L>For in old Grecian Writ it manifest is,</L>
<L><HI>Hero</HI> had Orders, and was <HI>Venus</HI> Priestess.</L>
<L>At once she drew, and answer'd Lovers pleas,</L>
<L>'Tween them she made, and carry'd messages,</L>
<L>Hagler of <HI>chere entier,</HI> and did supply,</L>
<L>For modest gain, humane necessity;</L>
<L>But needy folks for nothing wou'd relieveâ–ª</L>
<L>And still of her own store was free to give.</L>
<L>She was, I vow and swear, as good a creature</L>
<L>As ever wore bright Symptome of good nature,</L>
<L>Loves Cobweb, or his net, or golden fleece,</L>
<L>As Poets say, who can choose Mistresses,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="8"/>
And they their meanest Heroe will not bed,</L>
<L>With any thing whose Hair is not Fox-red.</L>
<L>Her Brows soft Fur was of a paler Dye,</L>
<L>Conformable to that which prettily</L>
<L>Peep'd on her upper Lip, and cowardly</L>
<L>Made shew of Heroine Virility.</L>
<L>Day in her large Cow-Eyes was broad awake,</L>
<L>No heavy sleepy Morn there seem'd to break.</L>
<L>Sir <HI>Phoebus</HI> given, as you know, to flatter,</L>
<L>With his own Lustre did her Face bespatter:</L>
<L>For then Freckles of night on Cheeks not strew'd</L>
<L>To make the White remaining be allow'd:</L>
<L>Her Lipsâ€”but stay, was not <HI>Pigmalion</HI> won</L>
<L>With a senseless Description of his own?</L>
<L>Let it suffice then all who are concern'd,</L>
<L>That in her Face 'twas openly discern'd</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="9"/>
How near she was to <HI>Venus</HI> in her place;</L>
<L>And by her Stature seen her Heavenly Race:</L>
<L>For she not only streight, but tall as Mast:</L>
<L>Beauty's whole World in all perfection vast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yearly at <HI>Sestus</HI> Town for <HI>Venus</HI> sake,</L>
<L>Mother of Wakes, was kept a jolly Wake:</L>
<L>But <HI>Greeks</HI> say 'twas a customary Howling</L>
<L>For her <HI>Adonis,</HI> or Annual Condoling</L>
<L>Their Goddesses and Countries active Drudge,</L>
<L>Who keenly carry'd on their mortal Grudge</L>
<L>Against a certain Outlaw, who i'th' Woods</L>
<L>Reign'd Lord, and King, and liv'd on true mens Goods:</L>
<L>That reap'd and mow'd where he did never plow,</L>
<L>But where he plow'd, none e're cou'd reap or mow:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="9"/>
Who Plow-mans Joy did trample under foot,</L>
<L>And Tyrant-like, let nothing near him sprout.</L>
<L>But those small faults, such as the <HI>Greeks</HI> cou'd pardon,</L>
<L>And composition Carrots out of Garden</L>
<L>Had giv'n him yearly, wou'd the Churl have spar'd</L>
<L>But their meat, drink, and cloth in the Vineyard:</L>
<L>Yet he wou'd not be wean'd; but at their charges</L>
<L>Basely alone went on carowsing Verjuice,</L>
<L>And was before the pressing of the Liquor,</L>
<L>Of jolly Grecian Bowls the shrewdest Nicker:</L>
<L>Whence all the thirsty <HI>Greeks</HI> grew mad, &amp; swore</L>
<L>Deeply, they'd drink the rest out in his Gore;</L>
<L>And straight the bold Associates pitch'd upon</L>
<L>A Chief to lead them, or to bid 'em on;</L>
<L>Who though he had no hair on Chin, or Brestâ–ª</L>
<L>Had Valour nevertheless most manifest:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="10"/>
And <HI>Mars</HI> himself 'tis thought hath oft out-done;</L>
<L>For it is certain <HI>Venus</HI> loved none</L>
<L>Like him of all her Lusty Boys, and Cronies</L>
<L>Good Bit of flesh, call'd as I said, <HI>Adonis;</HI></L>
<L>Had gift of Vigilance to boot, no Snorter:</L>
<L>Must rise betimes that cou'd beat up his Quarter;</L>
<L>For when Night 'gan to peel, and Day was dawnâˆ£ing,</L>
<L>Up he wou'd get, and leave his Goddess yawnâˆ£ing,</L>
<L>Who waking, turn'd to th' Wall, and thought t'ave had 'im,</L>
<L>As other Utensils, where she had laid him;</L>
<L>But found the eager Huntsman still would leap</L>
<L>The Fence, not taking notice of the Gap:</L>
<L>Whence straight in rage she call'd him curtail'd Fellow,</L>
<L>And then to ease her heart, she cuff'd her Pillow.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="10"/>
So when the Hare is mist where she was squatting,</L>
<L>Next Bush the mump'd Pursuers fall a beating.</L>
<L>But when sh'ad paus'd (quoth she) 'tis <HI>Phoebe</HI> is chief</L>
<L>Cause, and Contriver alway of my Mischief:</L>
<L>That long-legg'd Ramp, that daggle-tail'd she-Ranger,</L>
<L>To well disposed Folkes still Dog in Manger:</L>
<L>She leads the able Youth astray, bewitches</L>
<L>Them with that early Itch of leaping Ditches;</L>
<L>And in their warm Bed will not let them tarry,</L>
<L>Where if they love toil they might be aweary,</L>
<L>And to the prickly Thickets need not roam;</L>
<L>Till out of breath might beat the Bush at home.</L>
<L>But let 'um go like Fops, for know stale Maid,</L>
<L>(With that she snear'd) that we have men more staid,</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="11"/>
And you but spoil our sport to make it better,</L>
<L>And when my Foe, in truth art but my Setter.</L>
<L>So fumbling Bards do oft depose a Rhime,</L>
<L>But to admit one that will better chime.</L>
<L>Mean while the Goddess held all these discourses,</L>
<L><HI>Adonis</HI> was a tooting for his forces:</L>
<L>For note though Hunting's said to be in fashion,</L>
<L>Much like to grinning Honours Recreation;</L>
<L>In this they disagree, for in the War</L>
<L>O'th Woods, the Captain is the Trumpeter,</L>
<L>And makes the first proof of his scorning Death,</L>
<L>By being free, and lavish of his Breath.</L>
<L>So did our Leader, who when he had drawn</L>
<L>His Band of Green-coats out upon the Lawn,</L>
<L>By Proverbs sage advise to scape a trip,</L>
<L>Resolv'd with them to look ere he did leap;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="11"/>
Which to wise Warriors custom is according,</L>
<L>Who ere they fall to Blows, do fall a Wording;</L>
<L>By which means those that are in Reason stout,</L>
<L>The Enemy before they see him, rout.</L>
<L>And first as they in Story oft did find,</L>
<L>Sly Ancients did, they made the most o'th' wind:</L>
<L>Then sent abroad their Scouts, which man still recâˆ£kons</L>
<L>In time of War or Peace, his faithful Seconds.</L>
<L>For when the Shepherd hath a mind to sleep,</L>
<L>They are the Guard, and <HI>Hectors</HI> of the Sheep;</L>
<L>And when it is his pleasure to go murther,</L>
<L>In that Heroick Vertue none go further;</L>
<L>So that if I may judge, they have much wrong,</L>
<L>To be left out of Registering Song.</L>
<L>But he which makes, not he who ends the quarrel,</L>
<L>Is known to run away still with the Lawrel.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="12"/>
But to leave off the wont Poetick Pother,</L>
<L>Small sense with heaps of words t'orelay and smoâˆ£ther.</L>
<L>The Chase, know then in few words, was begun,</L>
<L>And nimble Rogues had got the start o'th' Sun,</L>
<L>And to the Forest merrily did trudge</L>
<L>With Pole on shoulder to leap Ditch, or Hedge,</L>
<L>Which Pole (some say) had iron Peg at end on't,</L>
<L>In case that Boar should chance to prove Defenâˆ£dant.</L>
<L>By Thorn, or Holly Turn-pikes of the Wood</L>
<L>The doubty Yongsters scorn'd to be withstood;</L>
<L>For through the surly Thickets each did rush,</L>
<L>And manfully then fall upon his Bush:</L>
<L>So that, alas, throughout the spacious Forest,</L>
<L>The smallest of her Tenants cou'd have no rest.</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="12"/>
The Hare <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰"/> lurking Cunny, and the Squirril,</L>
<L>Must all have then sate still at their own peril.</L>
<L>For lazy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰"/> himself began to reckon</L>
<L>That he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰"/> move if he wou'd save his Bacon;</L>
<L>And as all Heroes who are truly bred,</L>
<L>Scorn'd to be caught by sneaking Death abed;</L>
<L>So took his heels; yet as bold <HI>Parthian,</HI></L>
<L>His teasing Foes still wounding as he ran:</L>
<L>But finding odds against him, not afraid,</L>
<L>Yet danger prudently with honour weigh'd;</L>
<L>And since not able to resist their force,</L>
<L>Bravely resolv'd to beat 'um in a course:</L>
<L>Or rather (as some guess) he had the cunning</L>
<L>Of the sly <HI>Roman</HI> who made a shew of running,</L>
<L>His Foes not to avoid, but separate;</L>
<L>That singly with 'em he might try his fate.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="13"/>
For when the Sentinel <HI>Adonis</HI> popt</L>
<L>Out of his Hawthorn ambush, strait he stopt;</L>
<L>And Youth no sooner shew'd his meaning cruel,</L>
<L>But Boar tossing his Snout, receiv'd the Duel.</L>
<L>But Fate not half so meek as now adays,</L>
<L>Contented to take up with bloodless frays,</L>
<L>Sends folkes afield to measure Swords, and Valour,</L>
<L>And after trial neither found the taller;</L>
<L>But both lest Fame should lie, do live to tell</L>
<L>The world that they were both invincible:</L>
<L>Nor then was Honour bound by Law of Quarter,</L>
<L>To chouse her self of many a brave Martyr.</L>
<L>The Boar, as wise folkes say, harm watch, harm catch,</L>
<L>In's own defence, his Huntsman did dispatch:</L>
<L>Now tender Virgins who are always ready</L>
<L>To shew y'ave bowels, hold yet till I bed ye:</L>

When Love by shoulder look their Dames do crave,</L>
<L>They stare not on 'um, and ask what they'd have.</L>
<L>And happy Dames, they never were put to't yet</L>
<L>To speak as I am now, or go without it.</L>
<L>Then to <HI>Leander</HI> she made but one stride,</L>
<L>To peer in's Face, which his coy Hands deny'd,</L>
<L>But to withdraw 'em, when in vain she askt him,</L>
<L>She like a <HI>Bully</HI> swore, and then unmask'd him</L>
<L>By force of Arms, since she cou'd not intreat him,</L>
<L>And vow'd she cou'd find of her heart to beat him.</L>
<L>Then poor <HI>Leander</HI> gave himself for gone,</L>
<L>And thought his Breeches were already down:</L>
<L>And of remorse in her he quite despairing,</L>
<L>Took heart, and spoke out thus, in her own hearâˆ£ing;</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="27"/>
Are you the same that look'd but now forsooth</L>
<L>As if Butter wou'd not melt in your mouth?</L>
<L>She that just now refus'd to bait the passion</L>
<L>Of gaping Lovers with the least temptation?</L>
<L>She that did make green Apron fall so low</L>
<L>One might have seen that same assoon as Toe?</L>
<L>And rather than she wou'd take up her Coat,</L>
<L>She with a shameless daggle-tail did trot,</L>
<L>To keep her Followers from sight-provoking</L>
<L>Of Blew, of Russet, or of yellow-Stocking?</L>
<L>And while she follow'd was with humble praying,</L>
<L>She ne'er look'd back, but gave them all their sayâˆ£ing.</L>
<L>She cou'd not speak, at least that one cou'd hear her,</L>
<L>And is she grown o'th' sudden such a Tearer?</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="27"/>
<HI>Hero</HI> mean while was not abash'd a whit;</L>
<L>But rather glad he Venom had to spit:</L>
<L>I mean, that of his Tongue he was so able,</L>
<L>To which she suddenly was responsible:</L>
<L>And with a shrug, a mouth, and cogging smile,</L>
<L>Such as of wrath a Cuckold wou'd beguil,</L>
<L>She said, What will you be a new way jealous,</L>
<L>And 'cause I am not kind to other Fellows,</L>
<L>Naughty <HI>Leander,</HI> think that I can be</L>
<L>But from Teeth outward other ways to thee?</L>
<L>And 'cause for you their Suits I do reject,</L>
<L>Will you inconscionable mine neglect?</L>
<L>The Turtle might as well repudiate</L>
<L>His Female, 'cause with him she'll only mate,</L>
<L>And scorns the common Flocks communication;</L>
<L>But groans out to him (all day) her chast passion,</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="28"/>
And 'cause with neck thrust out shews she is wilâˆ£ling,</L>
<L>As well might he (I say) refrain from Billing;</L>
<L>As you, because you see that I am coming,</L>
<L>Refrain the most delicious sport of Bumming;</L>
<L>And (as 'tis falsely said of us) to spight</L>
<L>Others, will not your self, lov'd self delight?</L>
<L>Be't so, I with your hardship am content,</L>
<L>But you for me shall not your self torment:</L>
<L>For in spight of your teeth you shall consent,</L>
<L>To take on me your full divertisement.</L>
<L>So took him 'bout the neck, and was so quick,</L>
<L><HI>Leander</HI> had not time to turn his Cheek.</L>
<L>But scarce cou'd Five be told, when with his Fist,</L>
<L>Plac'd in the Pit-hole of her Love-sick Brest,</L>
<L>Her tender Breech he had laid on the ground,</L>
<L>Had not kind Hassock in its way been found,</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="28"/>
Which rais'd up lower end so fav'rably,</L>
<L>That something there <HI>Leander</HI> did espy,</L>
<L>That call'd back to his heart Humanity:</L>
<L>And then taking her up by painful halling,</L>
<L>Did expiate his laying her a sprawling.</L>
<L>And mannerly with Leg drawn back did own</L>
<L>His hainous fault in throwing of her down;</L>
<L>But she good-natur'd Maid, said it was none:</L>
<L>And ask'd him pardon if sh'ad done him wrong.</L>
<L>Alas, said he, good <HI>Hero,</HI> if your Tongue</L>
<L>You had kept to your self but when you kist,</L>
<L>I likewise to my self had kept my Fist.</L>
<L><HI>Catso,</HI> quoth <HI>Hero,</HI> was that all the Matter?</L>
<L>Indeed you shan't find fault with that herea'ter,</L>
<L>But try me once again: he cry'd Come 'an.</L>
<L>But from her Sluts Trick she cou'd not refrain:</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="29"/>
Whereat <HI>Leander</HI> once more did look big,</L>
<L>And sputt'ring call'd her Impudent <HI>Tom-Rigg:</HI></L>
<L>While she with Court'sie said, no one exact is</L>
<L>In any thing at first; but let me practise</L>
<L>On you a while, and whip me, if I'm missing</L>
<L>A Tittle in your Method nice of kissing;</L>
<L>But sweet <HI>Leander,</HI> do not turn away</L>
<L>A faithful willing Servant the first day.</L>
<L>As Courts do say, Assurance innocent</L>
<L>I have, but not as you said, Impudent:</L>
<L>I have no harm in me, although I'm frolick,</L>
<L>Which most men (as my Mother tells me) do like.</L>
<L>Therefore but for your satisfaction,</L>
<L>And but to you have now good humour shown.</L>
<L>For as you did observe your self, I'm rugged</L>
<L>To other solkes, ill-natur'd, cross, and dogged:</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="29"/>
But wou'd endeavour to please you alone,</L>
<L>'Cause besides you I pleased am with none.</L>
<L>With that she pump'd some tears into her eyes,</L>
<L>Which into his did pump up some likewise.</L>
<L>For tears do tears beget, and 'tis a true thing,</L>
<L>The Lovers falling out is Loves renewing.</L>
<L>But while he sob'd, <HI>Hero</HI> had prudent thought</L>
<L>Of striking of the Iron while 'twas hot.</L>
<L>Therefore took out crack'd Groat from Purse of Leather,</L>
<L>To witness they wou'd thenceforth lie together,</L>
<L>And ask'd him if he'd deign to break it with her.</L>
<L>He chearfully did lend her all his force;</L>
<L>So they to joyn themselves crack'd Groat divorce.</L>
<L>Now Lover mark you well from Custom antique</L>
<L>I mean thou silly Rogue that art so frantick</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="30"/>
To bustle for a Mistress, sigh, and sob,</L>
<L>When thou hast not a Penny in thy Fob:</L>
<L>For all your pains is lost when you have woo'd her,</L>
<L>If Money you have not your hearts to so'der.</L>
<L>For now not one like <HI>Hero</HI> will disburse</L>
<L>On Love a grey Groat out of her own Purse.</L>
<L>Nay they'll not trust on tick a pair of Kisses,</L>
<L>Nor can you trade with Rhimes, or fine promisses.</L>
<L>But <HI>Hero</HI> was a Lady of a thousand,</L>
<L>Who by her self of her own heart was cousen'd:</L>
<L>For sure <HI>Leander</HI> knew no Politicks,</L>
<L>No Lime-twig words, or subtle sly Dog-tricks</L>
<L>To chase, to circumvent her, or to catch'er;</L>
<L>Or where she itch'd did know, or where to scratch her;</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="30"/>
For she was forc'd, although 'twas not the fashion,</L>
<L>To put him first in mind of consummation;</L>
<L>And told him that about Twelve of the Clock</L>
<L>She wou'd expect him with clean Sheets &amp; Smock,</L>
<L>At her own Mothers House, at sign of Tow'r:</L>
<L>But warn'd him he shou'd knock at the Back-door;</L>
<L>And that her old Nurse should sit up, and spin,</L>
<L>To drown the noise he'd make, and let him in.</L>
<L>In the mean time to th' May-pole, and the Green</L>
<L>She bid him go to see, and to be seen,</L>
<L>Or where he wou'd might saunter up and down,</L>
<L>And count the Signs, and fine things of the Town:</L>
<L>Or to the Shore might go, if nothing else</L>
<L>He had to do, and pick up pretty Shells.</L>
<L>But howsoe're himself he chose to recreate,</L>
<L>He should be sure to keep her Honours Secret.</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="31"/>
There are, quoth she, who kill a womans honour,</L>
<L>Rather than lose their Glory to have won her.</L>
<L>But were there Justice, sure they shou'd have reaâˆ£son</L>
<L>By Halter done, to their pernicious treason.</L>
<L>For plaguy, and unspeakable's the wrong</L>
<L>To the whole world by those Blabs of their tongue</L>
<L>Many an Innocent on both sides mourn,</L>
<L>Look pale, and pine away, in Feavers burn,</L>
<L>And can't trust, nor be trusted for good turn,</L>
<L>But he who is of Female good name chary,</L>
<L>With the whole Sex sure as it were may marry.</L>
<L>Be warn'd <HI>Leander</HI> then; for I defie</L>
<L>'Till now the world to say that black's my Eye,</L>
<L>And none cou'd touch my Reputation</L>
<L>'Till now with man I've been two hours alone;</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="31"/>
Which lest that it shou'd come to be Town-talk,</L>
<L>Prithee my sweet <HI>Leander,</HI> let us walk.</L>
<L>Why don't you wag, my Heart, why do you stay?</L>
<L>Quoth he, d'y' think that I'll lead you the way?</L>
<L>Sure, sure, Fair <HI>Hero,</HI> I'll not go before ye:</L>
<L>Pish, pish, quoth she, again that's such a Story,</L>
<L>I am the Priestess, and must shut the door;</L>
<L>Leave Fooling prithee, and go on before.</L>
<L>Only remember that you keep your hour;</L>
<L>And when 'tis dark, find out your way to th' tow'r.</L>
<L>Then rather than be troublesom, he chose</L>
<L>To do as he was bid, and follow's Nose:</L>
<L>And to the Woods (as Lovers use) did ramble.</L>
<L>Mean while his Mistress to the Town did amble.</L>
<L>But 'twixt true Lovers (you'l say 'tis a wonder)</L>
<L>There's no absence though ne're so much asunder.</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="32"/>
For busie mind can find out no evasion,</L>
<L>Sweet Miss will hang upon imagination.</L>
<L>Though <HI>Hero</HI> and her Dear went quite contrary,</L>
<L>Yet in his heart and mind she still did tarry;</L>
<L>Or else ('tis thought) ere Twelve he had been weary;</L>
<L>Though he had all the pretty Recreations,</L>
<L>With which Lovers do hush their whuling passiâˆ£ons.</L>
<L>As he stalk'd on sometimes he fell a Quaiting</L>
<L>Round Tiles to be unmindful of his Waiting.</L>
<L>And as he reel'd along the green Hedge-Rows,</L>
<L>He rummag'd them for Black-berries and Sloes.</L>
<L>Or then on Mole-hill squatted, with a Key,</L>
<L>Did whistle out a chearing Roundeley,</L>
<L>'Till Emmet put him out to make him scratch</L>
<L>Impatient Buttock, where she made it itch:</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="32"/>
Or by cool Spring lay down on Bed of Dazies,</L>
<L>And on her Cristal Surface made Love-faces,</L>
<L>Or in her murmuring soft conversation</L>
<L>Did weep, and murmur too to cool his Passion:</L>
<L>With <HI>Philomel,</HI> or Pye, or Daw did prate,</L>
<L>And sometime too with Gossip Eccho chat:</L>
<L>Or with the Tag of Codpiece Point on Bark</L>
<L>Of Trees did scratch and scribble <HI>Hero</HI>'s Markâ–ª</L>
<L>Or did unravel all her Sacred Name,</L>
<L>To knit it up again in Anagram.</L>
<L>And sometime in tight Rhime as much bely'd her,</L>
<L>As if the Rogue ne'er in his Life had spy'd her;</L>
<L>For sure <HI>Leander</HI> was a <HI>Burlesque</HI> Poet,</L>
<L>Though 'till in Love (like me) he did not know it.</L>
<L>In such like exercise he whil'd away</L>
<L>The fant'ring minutes of the tedious day:</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="33"/>
But when night came, to keep off Spright or Else,</L>
<L>He talk'd, and sung, and whistled to himself.</L>
<L>But in the Woods no longer then wou'd tarry,</L>
<L>Lest that his Breech shou'd feel the Nails of Fairy.</L>
<L>He therefore back to <HI>Sestus</HI> Town did creep,</L>
<L>And while Folkes were abed, and all asleep,</L>
<L>(As oft his Betters) on a Bulk, or Bench,</L>
<L>Three or four hours had patience for his Wench.</L>
<L>But ere the drawling Clock knockt out thrice four</L>
<L>He was a knocking at back-door of Tow'r,</L>
<L>But first (some say) he had a special care</L>
<L>To make the most of his long yellow hair,</L>
<L>And with his Comb, and Fingers made it stare</L>
<L>Methodically, and look killing big,</L>
<L>For he grand <HI>Virtuoso</HI> was in Wig.</L>
<L>Besides he put his willing Hat in mind</L>
<L>Of cocking up before, and eke behind:</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="33"/>
And then with single Knuckle; and no more,</L>
<L>Inform'd the watchful Nurse he was at dore,</L>
<L>By whom ('tis said) he was not long unheard;</L>
<L>As <HI>Hero</HI> knew she was a trusty Card.</L>
<L>For on Love-Errands oft she made her trudge,</L>
<L>Indeed, she was an honest careful Drudge,</L>
<L>Loves painful Char-woman, and ever did</L>
<L>Help on all Bawdy work in time of need.</L>
<L>When she had let <HI>Leander</HI> in, she made him</L>
<L>Pull off his Shoes ere she to <HI>Hero</HI> led him:</L>
<L>For by the door of <HI>Hero</HI>'s Mothers Chamber</L>
<L>To <HI>Hero</HI>'s Garret he was bound to clamber.</L>
<L>Besides she knew Love is inhans'd by fear;</L>
<L>So stollen Bread and Cheese is mighty Chear.</L>
<L>But though <HI>Leander</HI> went as if on Eggs,</L>
<L>Yet he so loftily did bear his Legs,</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="34"/>
That of four or five steps, he made but one,</L>
<L>And lingring <HI>Hero</HI> was no more alone,</L>
<L>Nor unprepar'd for his Reception.</L>
<L>Her Garret was new swept, and she well drest</L>
<L>For exercise in <HI>Just-au-Corps</HI> or Vest,</L>
<L>As those who can't endure to be strait-lac'd;</L>
<L>Or may be in a Petticoat, and Wastcoat,</L>
<L>In Bawdy <HI>Indian</HI> Gown, or Bawds long last-coat,</L>
<L>In Cloak of Ermin, or a <HI>Tyrian</HI> Mantle;</L>
<L>But for my part, what she had on, I can't tell;</L>
<L>For some are not asham'd to say a Blanquet;</L>
<L>But two joyn'd-stools were cover'd with a Banâˆ£quet,</L>
<L>Which made her Dear <HI>Leander</HI> not much matter</L>
<L>How she was drest, 'twas that made his mouth water:</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="34"/>
She saw't, and therefore let her Passion wait,</L>
<L>Till hungry Lover had ta'ne out his Bait.</L>
<L>So strait, to lose no time, did pull him down</L>
<L>Into a Chair with Arms, and cry'd, Fall on,</L>
<L>If you can like of any thing that's here.</L>
<L>He vow'd it was most excellent good Chear,</L>
<L>But he did praise it better by his Swallow,</L>
<L>And there was nought that was not a <HI>Regallo.</HI></L>
<L>Botargo first, and a Red Herring, for</L>
<L>She still had her <HI>pet it morceau aboire.</HI></L>
<L>But for <HI>Leanders</HI> curious maiden Chaps</L>
<L>There were provided dainty fine Flip-flaps,</L>
<L>Apple-pie, Custard, Florentine, and Cheese-cake,</L>
<L>And only as I said before, for his sake,</L>
<L>Gingerbread, and stew'd Prunes of her own stewâˆ£ing,</L>
<L>And for his Drink, Stypone of her Brewing;</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="35"/>
To which, <HI>Hero,</HI> and he were both beholden,</L>
<L>For modest Lover it did soon embolden,</L>
<L>To take her by the sweaty hand, and sip</L>
<L>Far stronger Nectar from her Blabber-Lip.</L>
<L>And when she had made him drink off his rest,</L>
<L>He cou'd begin a Brimmer to the Best.</L>
<L>But subtle <HI>Hero</HI> in her over-tunning</L>
<L>Of empty Lover, was but over-cunning.</L>
<L>For quite contrary to her wise intent,</L>
<L>All she tunn'd up in him had a false Vent.</L>
<L>Indeed she made him ready for the Bed,</L>
<L>And had the Drunkards sport to hold his head,</L>
<L>But she unfortunate, meant something else,</L>
<L>And ere she was aware, o're-turn'd the Bells;</L>
<L>So oflewd expectation quite did miss,</L>
<L>As now chaste Reader doth I'm sure, of his.</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="35"/>
But be not angry, ere Cock-crowing season,</L>
<L>To you, and <HI>Hero</HI> too I'll see done reason.</L>
<L>But let her put <HI>Leander</HI> first to Bed,</L>
<L>And on Flock-Pillow rest Lop-heavy Head;</L>
<L>Then fit it with a Coifin stead of Cap,</L>
<L>Tuck up the Cloaths in order to his Nap,</L>
<L>And then let her a while but pick her Toes,</L>
<L>And Lamp goes out, and into Bed she goes.</L>
<L>Then (as I told you) ere the Cock crow'd thrice</L>
<L>And <HI>Hero</HI> had piss'd once, <HI>Leander</HI> twice,</L>
<L>(But forward Sir, pray do not now mistake)</L>
<L>Did yawn, and stretch, and civilly awake</L>
<L>At the first Summons of her Elbow, which</L>
<L>On purpose lent his side a plaguie stitch.</L>
<L>Then did he puff, and belch, and sigh, and groan,</L>
<L>And to the Gods make lamentable moan:</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="36"/>
But <HI>Hero</HI> for her sake took pity on him,</L>
<L>Did stroak him, feel his Pulses, and bemoan him,</L>
<L>And charitably too his Stomack settle,</L>
<L>By help of Life-restoring Pewter Bottle:</L>
<L>So by her Aid, Directions, and Dalliance,</L>
<L>As well's he cou'd he made out's new Alliance.</L>
<L>But spiteful Jade <HI>Aurora</HI> strait intruding,</L>
<L>There was an end then of the Secret Wedding:</L>
<L>And glad <HI>Leander</HI> in such hast arose,</L>
<L>That out of Bed he tumbled on his Nose;</L>
<L>And for his own Stockings put on <HI>Hero</HI>'s:</L>
<L>Fate's still contriving Lovers to disclose.</L>
<L>Nor staid to wash his stinking hands, or put on</L>
<L>His Azure Band, or Shamey Doublet button:</L>
<L>But with a Kiss took leave of his dear Bride,</L>
<L>Resolving for her not to lose his Tide;</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="36"/>
For from the Shore was heard thrice, <HI>Eastward hol</HI></L>
<L>And with his Towns-folkes he was mad to go:</L>
<L>So lost no time; but while he was let out,</L>
<L>To the old Nurse made this true Lovers doubt,</L>
<L>That <HI>Hero</HI> wou'd procure her self some <HI>Monsieur,</HI></L>
<L>Who many a good time and oft wou'd bounce her</L>
<L>Ere he shou'd get o'th' t'other side 'oth' water.</L>
<L>To which she said Fie, Fie man, no such matter.</L>
<L>Though heavy Judgments fall upon ye, you men</L>
<L>Will never leave your base thoughts of poor Woâˆ£men.</L>
<L>But time will come (and she or none cou'd tell,</L>
<L>For she in Magick Art had devilish skill,</L>
<L>And on a Col-staff oft had gall'd her Breech,</L>
<L>Was tri'd, and got off'cause she was a Witch)</L>

When Love incens'd, won't tyrannize alone</L>
<L>In Lovers heart (as now he doth) but bone:</L>
<L>When Lover for his Miss obtain'd shall groan,</L>
<L>And through a single Nostril tune his moan:</L>
<L>And jealous man shall envy happy Brute,</L>
<L>Who without fear, or shame does go to Rut.</L>
<L>To this <HI>Leander</HI> nothing cou'd reply,</L>
<L>For Prophesies must give themselves the Lie.</L>
<L>But Pox upon her soul for her Record,</L>
<L>All the World knows she was as good's her word.</L>
<L>She wou'd have farther spun the Pockey Riddle,</L>
<L>But Youth in hast did break't off in the middle,</L>
<L>And left her, and Town <HI>Sestus</HI> 'till dark night,</L>

As he, and <HI>Hero</HI> had contriv'd, was his</L>
<L>To keep him in his way where no path is.</L>
<L>And by her means he did not run aground,</L>
<L>But in the right Port whither he was bound</L>
<L>Unladed safe, and sound his precious Stowage,</L>
<L>And made (as Folkes do say) a happy Voyage,</L>
<L>Nay some (at least) say half a dozen, but</L>
<L>Dame Fortune first, or last, doth prove a Slut.</L>
<L>She did contest with the more faithless wind,</L>
<L>Which should be more false to him, or unkind,</L>
<L>For in the Window of vex'd <HI>Hero</HI>'s Garret</L>
<L>Five or six long Watch-lights in vain did blare out,</L>
<L>Ere he cou'd put to Sea; and when he did,</L>
<L>It had been better he at home had staid.</L>
<L>But though the huffing surly Winds did nose him,</L>
<L>And strutting Billows crowded to oppose him,</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="38"/>
From's Mistress he no longer wou'd be kept,</L>
<L>But like a drunken Heroe headlong leapt</L>
<L>Amidst his Foes, resolving to come at her,</L>

<L>His way, in spight of Northern Blubber-Cheek;</L>
<L>Mean while ('tis said) they made e'ne nothing of him,</L>

<L><PB N="73" REF="38"/>
And as in Blanket you wou'd toss a Whelp,</L>
<L>Tost him, while he no more himself cou'd help.</L>
<L>And though he sprawl'd, and kept on going still,</L>
<L>It was, as one may say, e'ne but up hill.</L>
<L>So to his Oars of Flesh such chearing words,</L>
<L>Was fain to use, as Errants to their Swords;</L>
<L>And told them, if they wou'd row stoutly on,</L>
<L>They shou'd embrace his naked Miss anon.</L>
<L>But finding soon that Harangue prov'd but idle,</L>
<L>He turn'd his Stile, the wind and waves to whedle:</L>
<L>And vow'd if they wou'd please but to reprieve him</L>
<L>From drowning 'till he came back, he'd forgive 'um.</L>
<L>But Fate whose slaves they were, cou'd not be chous'd,</L>
<L>For all his Vows he still was soundly dous'd:</L>

Yet sneering Fate but to augment her sport,</L>
<L>Permitted him almost to touch his Port.</L>

<L>Went out, or when his left Leg had the Cramp.</L>
<L>For he so much in Love was you may see,</L>
<L>He quite forgot a String about his Knee,</L>
<L><HI>Hero</HI> mean while who in her Bed had tost</L>
<L>As much as he at Sea had, or almost.</L>
<L>For she had dream'd of Flowers all the night,</L>
<L>Shrewd sign that some body is to turn Spright.</L>
<L>So weary of her Dreams, awak'd and rose;</L>
<L>But some say she awak'd ta'ne by the Nose</L>
<L>With the rude Haut-Goust of deceased Lamp,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Omen</HI> seiz'd her heart with pannick Damp</L>

For her Sweet-heart, but ah! when she did hear</L>
<L>The Winds and Sea so loud, she was past fear,</L>
<L>And by her croaking bowels then cou'd tell</L>
<L>(Were he at Sea) all with him was not well,</L>
<L>So grown impatient, to the Window flew,</L>
<L>And from her Eye-lids proking off the Glew,</L>
<L>Into the boiling water fell a staring,</L>
<L>Where she perceiv'd her dear Duck dead as herâˆ£ring.</L>
<L>But Day but just had shewn her Scarlet Snout,</L>
<L>So she had time for comfortable doubt,</L>
<L>And took her poor <HI>Leander</HI> for a Whale;</L>
<L>But prying to find out the proof of's Tail,</L>
<L>She out of Window thrust her self so far,</L>
<L>That Tiptoes slipt, and ere she was awar</L>
<L>(Some do dispute it though) she tipt clean over</L>
<L>Into the Brine upon her pickled Lover.</L>

Now hasty Lover do not damn the River,</L>
<L>Which though a while true Lovers it did sever,</L>
<L>Yet did unite 'um afterward for ever.</L>
<L>And let none take my tristful Song to heart,</L>
<L>Or for drown'd Lovers be concern'd a Fart;</L>
<L>For they but div'd directly to <HI>Elizium,</HI></L>
<L>Where such Folkes pass their time as you cou'd wish 'um.</L>
