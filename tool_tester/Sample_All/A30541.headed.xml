<P>SOME
False Principles
AND ERRORS
DISCOVERED
AND
REFUTED:
In a short Answer to a Catechism book, which is said
to contain, <HI>The Principles of Religion,</HI> put forth by
a namelesse Authour; But is supposed to be
the work of one <HI>Samuel Eaton,</HI> a profes∣sed
Minister of the Gospel, among
the Sect of the Independants,
in <HI>Cheshire.</HI> But upon true examination he is found to be teaching
the traditions of men for the commandements
of Christ; and his Principles are proved to
to be not according, but con∣trary
to the Spirit of God
and the Scriptures.</P>
<P>By <HI>E. B.</HI></P>

Printed for <HI>Thomas Simmons,</HI> at the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Mouth</HI> near

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reason and Cause of this being sent abroad
is for the better Information of all, but more
particularly for the good of that Assembly, to
whom <HI>Samuel Eaton</HI> is Minister and Pastor, that they
may know the truth from errour, and the way of Righ∣teousnesse
from all false wayes, and may turn from
Idol-shepherds that destroyes the vineyard, and treads
it down, and may come to Christ, and receive him who
is the chief shepherd, to feed his flock with the bread
of eternal life.</P>
<P>And the reason why these false principles are char∣ged
upon <HI>Samuel Eaton</HI> is this, it being doubtful to
some who was the Authour of that Catechism, wherein
these principles and doctrines was held forth: <HI>John
Gredley</HI> and <HI>Anne Sheeld</HI> by name was with the
said <HI>Samuel Eaton,</HI> and asked him if he owned that book
(the Catechism) and he said he would maintain all in it;
that was his answer.</P>

<PB N="3" REF="2" MS="y"/>
<P>THe wayes of the Lord are equall and just, but the
wayes of the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> are altogether corrupted,
and different and contrary to the wayes of Salvati∣on;
And the wisedome that is of this world is fool∣ishness
with God, and its end is destruction to it self, and to
all that walk therein; And what is man, that he shall prescribe
a way to his Maker? and who is it, that will be more wise then
God, to set him a way how he must teach his people? There∣fore
in vaine have men laboured, and have reaped to them∣selves
nothing but wind and confusion; And in vaine have
they sowen, for others to reap after them, whose fruit hath
been emptiness, and not filled the hand of the gatherer; And
in particular this book with which I am now dealing, is the
fruit of an empty Tree, which cannot satisfie the hungry soul,
nor comfort the weary seeker; for the satisfaction and com∣fort
of the seeking hungry soul dependeth only upon the
Lord, and upon the bread of life that commeth down from
God; and the soul that eats thereof is satisfied and comfor∣ted
for ever, and hungers no more, nor thirsts any longer;
but the fountaine is in him, and the well springs up unto e∣ternall
life, and he goes no more forth: And if so be that all
herein were true and sound Doctrine, and were learned, so as
to express it over againe in words this might be, and yet the
soul still remaining in anguish, and under sin and death,
though increased in the knowledg that is from below, and yet
in a farther ignorance of God; for the wisdom of this world
knows not God, neither can it teach, nor receive the know∣ledg
of the things that pertaines unto life eternall, but to the
simple and to fools doth the Lord teach and reveal the
knowledge of his kingdom, and it is not received from books,
nor the teachings and traditions of men, but by the manifes∣tation
of the eternall spirit which doth lead into all truth, and
reveal the mysteries of Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>The first thing that I take notice of is this, thou saist,</HI> God is
a Spirit, and he is one in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing, and is to be distinguished into three per∣sons,
and the Father, Son, and holy Ghost are personall relations; and if
one be a person such are the other, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y"/>
Ans. The Father, Son, and Spirit is one, this we believe
and know, according to the Scriptures; but as for thy word
person, that is carnall and too low a word to denominate God
by, who is infinite; for God and the spirit hath no person, nor
cannot truely be distinguished into persons; for a person hath
relation to place, time, and change, and is not in all places
at all times at once, and the Scriptures knowes no such di∣stinction,
for God is is a spirit, and hath no relation to one
time, place or alteration more then another, but filleth hea∣ven
and earth, and his presence is in all, and over all, who is
blessed for ever, and is infinite, and without person, or confi∣ned
being, and the Scripture no where in true translation,
doth denominate God, Christ and the spirit by persons, and
personall beings, nor doth distinguish them into three per∣sons;
for persons are related to carnall, as I have said, and
persons is to low, too denominate God and Christ and the spi∣rit
by: so thy principles are unsound, and not agreeing to the
spirit of God, and the Scriptures, And therefore not to be be∣leeved
nor received.</P>
<P><HI>Whereas thou saist,</HI> That the one standing rule, according to
which God is to be sought, worshipped and served, is the holy Scriptures,
in which God hath revealed himself in all things which he would have
believed and done, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ans. It is the spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures,
which spirit was and is within the saints that leadeth into all
truth, and teacheth to know all things, and that spirit of
God only is the standing rule to walk in, and to walk by; it
was the rule to <HI>Abel, Enoch, Abraham,</HI> and the rest of the holy
Fathers that lived before any scripture was written, and it
was the rule to the Prophets, to Christ and to the holy Apo∣stles,
they all followed the spirit and walked in it, and spake
and wrought and acted as the spirit of God within them mo∣ved
them, and led them, it was not the Scriptures, but the
sprit that gave forth the Scriptures that was the standing,
unchangable, unerring rule of worshiping serving and obey∣ing
the Lord God, and that same spirit is the <HI>standing rule to us</HI>
also; for the Apostle commands to walk in the spirit, and that
which we are to walk in is our rule, and as many as are the
sonns of God are led by the spirit of God, and then the spirit
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y"/>
is their rule, and that guides the feet in the way of peace, and
in the spirit is God worshipped, for they that worship him must
worship him in the spirit and in the truth, &amp; such he seeks to
worship him, for it is in the hearts of his people, and within
them that God reveales himself by his spirit, for it is the spi∣rit
that revealeth the things of God, and none knows the
things of God, saving by the spirit of God, and that reveals
God, and teacheth to worship God and to serve him, and the
Scriptures they declare of the rule, and of the revelation of
God, and are a declaration of all things which is to be belie∣ved
and practised by the children of the Lord; so that the
Scriptures are not the standing rule, neither doth it teach to
worship and serve God, but the spirit that gave forth the
Scriptures, that is the standing rule in and through all gene∣rations,
and the spirit doth reveal the knowledge of God, and
how he is to be worshipped and served.</P>
<P><HI>And thou saist,</HI> the Scriptures are the word of God, given by ime∣diate
inspiration of God, and that they are given to all men to be read,
and the Scriptures are sufficient to make the man of God perfect and
throughly furnished, and are able to make wise unto Salvation; and the
Scriptures and plain and easy to be understood by the simplest, and
there is milke in them for babes, and strong meat for persons grown up.</P>
<P>Ans. Christ is the word of God, and his name is called the
word of God, and the word of God was in the beginning and
shall endure for ever; and this word is not the Scriptures, and
the Scriptures are not the word, but the Scriptures are words
of God, given forth from the Word which was in their hearts
that spake forth the Scriptures, which were wro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as the
holy men of God were moved by the holy Ghost, and given
by the inspiration of the spirit of God, and the Scriptures are
a declaration, and a treatise of the Word that was in the be∣ginning,
and shall endure for ever; but the Scriptures are not
the word, and some of them were given to one sort of men,
and some of them to another, and some of them to all; but as
for the threatnings and Judgments pronounced, and the re∣proof
of the wicked, that part was not given to the Saints nor
spoken to them, and so not given to all, and the promises to
the children of the Lord, and the Epistles to the Saints, and
them that were sanctified, that part was not given &amp; spoken to
<PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y"/>
the world and to the wicked who are unconverted, and so
not spoken to all, though all may read them, yet none can un∣derstand
them but by the same spirit as gave them forth, and
who hath not the same spirit to guide them, they cannot un∣derstand
the Scriptures, for it was given forth by the eternall
spirit, and the carnall wisdom that is from below, and sensual,
cannot understand nor receive the things of the kingdom of
God, which is declared of in the Scriptures, and so the Scrip∣tures
are not easy to be understood, but are sealed from the
world, neither are the Scriptures without faith (which thou
hast left out) sufficient to make the man of God perfect, but
the Scriptures <HI>through faith,</HI> is able to make the man of God
perfect, and throughly Furnished, this we know and beleeve,
and doth set the Scriptures in its right place, and give it its
right honour and respect; and as for thee and thy generati∣on
who are erred from the spirit of truth, you know not the
Scriptures nor the power of God, for Christ is the bread of
life, and the water of life, in him is the milk for babes, and
meat for strong men, and not in the Scriptures who testifie
of Christ the life, and in them the Pharisees thought to have e∣ternall
life, but would not come to Christ the end of the
Scriptures that they might have life, and this is the self same
state with yours of this age, who thinks to have the perfect∣ing
of Salvation and the milk for babes, and the meat for
strong men in the Scriptures, but will not receive Christ
who is the perfect Salvation and the bread and water of life
for all the children of the Lord who are born of the spirit;
and so thy Doctrines, and thy principles of thy Religion, are
not sound nor agreeing with the Scriptures but contray, and
by a contrary spirit, and therefore we cannot be of thy mind,
but doth truly Judge thee to be unlearned of the Father, and
knows not the way of Salvation, and so thou cannot truly in∣form
nor direct others.</P>
<P><HI>And thou saist,</HI> men are under a necessity of multiplying trans∣gression▪
&amp;c. Rom. 3. 12. Ephes. 4. 17. 2 Pet. 2 4.</P>
<P>Answ. In this thou hast erred, and spoken contrary to
sound doctrine; for there is no necessity laid upon any to
commit any sin, much lesse a necessity of multiplying trans∣gression;
if there be a necessity, who layes it on men, and why
is that necessity? transgression is of the wicked one, and
<PB N="7" REF="4" MS="y"/>
who sins is of the Devill, and there is no necessity for that
upon any account, because sin destroyes the soul, and is a vex∣ation
to the Lord God, and a cause of everlasting misery, and
for to act that, there is no necessity, which hath these effects,
and thou hast perverted the Scriptures quoted by thee, to
prove thy false assertion which I have set down for the Reader
to peruse, that all may see thou hast perverted them, for they
prove no such Doctrine, as that there is a necessity of multi∣plying
transgression, which thou hast affirmed and brought
the Scriptures to prove it, which is first false doctrine uttered
by three, and also a perverting of the Scriptures to maintain
it, and this is too evils, which thou hast committed in one
work, and because thou hast done evill, it shall lie at thy dore,
and there I will leave it.</P>
<P><HI>And thou saist,</HI> to be Iu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fied is not to be really cleansed from all sin,
nor is it to partake of real righteousness and holines, but it is to be ac∣counted
and reputed Iust and holy, and not to have sin reckoned, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ans. There is none Justified but who are in Christ, and are
changed, and renewed and born again, and such are cleansed
from sin, for he that is born of God sinneth not, and it is he
onely that is Justified, and not the old man that is unchanged,
and committeth sin, he is not Justified; and who is born of God
and are Justified, are really cleansed and really doth partake of
righteousness and holiness, even of the righteousness and ho∣liness
of the Son of God, and in that righteousness he is ac∣counted
righteous, and in no other, nor by no other way
then by receiving Christ and his righteousness, and being
made partakers of it in their hearts, for the Apostle said, if
Christ be not in you, you are reprobates, and such are not Ju∣stified,
nor accounted just and holy who have not Christ
within them, and his righteosness, but who hath Christ
within, the hope of glory, and are accounted just and righte∣ous
in the sight of God, the body of sin is put off; for if Christ
be in you, the body is dead because of sin, and such are really
cleansed, and if he be in you, you are made partakers of reall
righteousness and holiness, and this is the truth of the Gos∣pell
of Christ which confounds and condemnes thy false Doc∣trine,
for no man is accounted and reputed just and holy, but
who are cleansed from sin, &amp; are in Christs; for who doth com∣mit
<PB N="8" REF="5" MS="y"/>
sin are unholy, and so reputed of God, and sin is reckon∣ed
to them, and this all will find in the day of the Lord,
when he comes to Judge righteously, and to give every man
according to his works, and not according to what he may
make a shew of and profess in words, though all you false
daubers with untempered morter, heale up the hurt of the
Daughter of <HI>Sion</HI> deceitfully, and cry peace, peace, by a false
applying the Promises and words of Christ, when God speakes
no peace, and even you and your false daubed wall will be
Whirle-wind of the Lord beat down and destroy utterly;
and this I assert contrary to thy false doctrine and princi∣ples,
that none are Justified, but who hath Christ in them,
and really partakes of holiness and righteousness, and are
really cleansed from sin, and are born of the spirit of
God, and is heire of the promise of eternall life.</P>
<P><HI>And further thou saist</HI> Iustification admitteth not of any degree▪
and if a person be Iustified from any one sin, he is Iustified from all
sin, as well from sins to be committed, as those that are already com∣mited,
and who is once a Iustified person, is not unjustified upon new
sin committed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ans. Grace and faith, and truth, and Christ himself admit∣teth
of degrees, or measures which are one, and there are se∣verall
measures of life, of light, of grace and faith, of sancti∣fication,
and of Justification also; for according as every man,
hath received Christ so hath he received Sanctification, and
Justification, and no otherwise, for Christ is made wisdome,
and Sanctification, and Salvation, and every one feels his
Sanctification, and his Justification, according to the measure
of the gift of Christ given to him, so that there are severall
measures of Justification, and also a man may be Justified
from one sin, or some sin, and not from all sin; for accor∣ding
to every mans Sanctification, so is the witness of his Ju∣stification
to him, and no more; and if thou knowest any
thing by experience thou knowest this, and no man is Justifi∣ed
from the evill which he is to commit, for that faith gives
licence to sin, if any committing sin, shall beleeve that that
sin is long since forgiven, and he is Justified from it, and if he
shall beleeve he is Justified, though he commit sin, even long
before he commits his sin, this will be a cause to run into sin,
<PB N="9" REF="5" MS="y"/>
and is a gap opened by thee, unto all unrighteousnesse; Why, if
people can believe they are justified from the sins which they have
yet to commit, what should restrain them from running with plea∣sure
into all unrighteousness? &amp; if new sins alwaies committed, do not
make persons unjustified, then may the sinners rejoice in their sins,
and take their pleasure in ungodliness; this doctrine of thine is plea∣sant
to the wicked, and it is the way and principle of liberty in all
sin, rather then the principles to lead from sin, and so thou hast
shewed whose work thou art doing, by strengthning the wicked in
his way, so that he cannot turne from sin, rather then drawing him
from sin, and this is the Devils work.</P>
<P>And thou saist such as are <HI>justified, are regenerated and sanctified;</HI>
and a little before thou said <HI>to be justified is not to be cleansed, nor is it
to partake of real righteousnesse; and persons are justified from sins which
they have to commit.</HI> And these are contradictions, and proceed out of
darknesse, and not from the light; and thy folly and ignorance may
be read by all men; for who are regenerated and sanctified are clean∣sed,
and partakes of real righteousnesse; and thou further saist, <HI>that
sanctification is a real change from sin to the purity of the Image of God</HI>
and I say none are sanctified but they are justified, so none are justi¦fied
but who are changed into the Image of God, this the trut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
saith, and wherein thou hast said contrary, thou hast spoken contra¦ry
to the truth, and the truth will judge thee.</P>
<P><HI>Again thou saist</HI> sanctification is not perfect in this life, <HI>&amp;</HI> the new man,
the spirit or law of the mind, is that grace or imperfect sanctification, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Then <HI>Christ</HI> is not perfect in this life, for he is made of God
unto us sanctification, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 30. but we say Christ is perfect, and
therefore sanctification is perfect, and the new man is the Image of
God, and is created in righteousnesse and in true holinesse; but thou
saist the <HI>new man is imperfect;</HI> consider of thy principles, when they
are compared with the scriptures, and see the error and wickednesse
of them, <HI>and the spirit and Law in the mind</HI> is the <HI>spirit</HI> of God, and the
Law of God in which the Apostles served God, and so doth all the
Saints; but thou saist the spirit and Law in the mind, <HI>is imperfect,</HI> and
this is error in the highest degree, to say or signifie that the new
man the Image of God, that is in righteousnesse and true holinesse,
and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God and the Law of God <HI>is imperfect sanctification,</HI>
and grace is the salvation, and is Gods sufficiencie, and that thou saist
<HI>is imperfect also;</HI> and thus thy principles of thy religion which thou
<PB N="10" REF="6" MS="y"/>
walkest in thy selfe, and would teach to others, are abominable, cor∣rupted
principles of error, and contrary to the spirit of truth, and to
the scriptures also; and no marvel that thy name is concealed, for thy
work deserves not a good mans name to it; much more might be
said to lay open further thy folly, but this is sufficient to men of un∣derstanding;
and contrary to thee I do assert, that the new man, the
Image of God, the <HI>Spirit</HI> and Law of God in the mind, is perfect
grace and perfect sanctification, and thou hast said the contrary, and
now whether thy principles of Religion, or mine, be the more true, and
whether fals, let all sober men judg with the light in their conscience,</P>
<P><HI>And thou saist,</HI> the old man, the flesh, the body of sin, the body of death,
is the sin that remaines in sanctified persons.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Who are sanctified, are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reed from the body of sin and death,
and hath put it off, and the Law of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of life hath freed them
from the flesh, and from the old man; for if the old man, the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh,
the body of sin, and death be in the sanctified person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, then there is
none sanctified at all, and what are they sanctified, freed and clean∣sed
from, if the old man, the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, the body of sin and death be yee re∣maining
in them? thou speakest like an unlearned man, and one that,
knowes not the sanctified estate, but art erring in thy mind, and judg∣ment,
and in thy words also, for we have put off the old man, and are
Crucified to the flesh, and made free from the body of sin and death,
and this is our sanctification, and who are remaining in these things
are not sanctified, but in the degeneration, and hath no part yet in the
kingdom of God, nor in Christ Jesus, but are without him in the world.</P>
<P><HI>And thou saist,</HI> the sanctification of the first day, hath put an end to
the sanctification of the seventh &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Here again thou hast uttered that which thou knowes not, for
all daies are alike unto God, and one sanctified as much as an other,
and no respect of daies with him, but all are holy, and pure, and
good, and when the sanctification of any thing is put to an end, (as
as thou saist the sanctification of the seventh day is) then the thing
is no more good, nor holy, but become evil and unclean, if it be no
more sanctified nor holy, and in this principle thou hast erred also; as
for the seventh day it was commanded of God to the Jews, to be kept
and observed holy to the Lord, and all manner of labour to all
Creatures were forbiden, which thing was a signe and a shadow of
a good thing to come, the end of which ordinance was Christs the
substance of all things, and the end of daies, and that there was any
<PB N="11" REF="6" MS="y"/>
anulling of that command to the Jews, and a command to keep and
observe the first day of the week in stead of the other, by any out∣ward
command, this we read not in all the Scriptures, and what
ground thou hast more then thy imaginations I know not; to assert
the changing of dayes, and to teach the observation of the first day,
as the Sabbath instead of the seventh day, seeing thou hast nothing in
the Scriptures to raise such a principle from, and so would make ex∣ception
of daies, and respect of times which the Apostles did not,
after the holy spirit was come; for daies and times all are a like to
God, and who are come to Christ the true rest of the immortal Soul,
are in the end of daies, and out of the respect of times, in the sub∣stance
which endures for ever, and in the Gospel ministrations, there
is no command or injunction, by Christ or by his Apostles given to
us for the observing any one day more then another.</P>
<P><HI>And thou saist, when it is said,</HI> swear not at all, the meaning is not
vainly and unnecessarily.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Christ hath not spoken doubtfully, but plainly, and he hath
not left his words to thee to give thy fals meaning upon; so thou ta∣kest
too much upon thee, and intrudest into things thou hast not seen,
and all swearing which is contrarie to the command of Christ, is
unnecessarie and vain, though by such false consequences and per∣verting
of Scriptures, thou &amp; thy generation hast made the people to
err, and led the blind by the way; for where the Scriptures, as they are
in themselves, doth not made for your turn, then it means not thus,
but otherwise, and this is the consequence, and it must be interpre∣ted
say you, and so you pervert the Scriptures to your own destructi∣on,
and to the undoing of manie others, for you that lead the people
cause them to err.</P>
<P><HI>And where is thou speakst,</HI> of outward seals of the Covenant, <HI>which
is</HI> Baptism (saist thou) which appertaines to grown persons converted,
and also to children, &amp;c. <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 39.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The seal of the covenant of God is the <HI>Spirit,</HI> even the <HI>Spirit</HI>
of promise which sealeth and confirmeth unto God, and not any out∣ward
thing; for the Covenant of God is inward and spiritual, and
not outward and carnal; and the seal and testimonie of it, is the spi∣rit
of life, and no tradition of man; and as for <HI>Baptism</HI> in that way
and manner administred and practised, as in the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
it is wholie an invention of man, and not after any Institution
and commandement of God, and sprinkling of infants, which is
said to be <HI>Baptism,</HI> is so far from being a seal of the Covenant of
<PB N="12" REF="7" MS="y"/>
God, that it is a mark of the whore of <HI>Rome,</HI> and was by her first of all
ordained and begun to be practised in her Church, and your false
Minsters have received it from her, and it is a seal and sign that you
and you Ministrie and Church is of the whore of <HI>Rome,</HI> and not of the
true Church of Christ; for, the Apostles nor the true Church of Christ
never ordained nor practised such a thing amongst them; and in
the true Church, as sprinkling of infants and calling it the Baptism
in the faith of Christ, and the seal of the Covenant, there was
no such practice and dostrine amongst them; but it is come up since
the true Church fled into the wildernesse, and since the beast received
power over kindreds and Nations, and it is an institution of the
great whore that hath sat upon the waters, for many generations, and
she hath made Nations drink her cup of fornication, and the o∣riginal
of this practice and principle is received out of the whores
Cup, and not by any commandement of Christ, or axample of his
Church and Apostles; and I cannot but charge thee, that thou teaches
for doctrine the traditions of men, and holds forth for principles of
Religion, to be believed and learned, the institutions of the great
whore, of whose cup thou hast drunk, and would also give it to others
that they may drink it also, and to accomplish which evil end thou
hast perverted the Scriptures <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 39. for the Scripture hath no such
thing intended in it, as to the baptising of infants, for which end
thou hast falsely cited it, for though the promise is to as many as the
Lord our God shall call, yet what is this to the sprinkling of infants,
which thou asserts as a principle of Religion, and would seem to en∣force
it, by vertue of the Scripture mentioned? but thou hast abused
the Scripture, and shewed thy selfe to be disagreeing to the holie
Ministers and Apostles of Christ, and to be agreeing with the false
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and this is answer sufficient to thee.</P>
<P><HI>And thou saist,</HI> The outward covenant of God is conditionall, and the
profession of the faith entitles both such as make it, and their infants unto
it (<HI>to wit,</HI>) the covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The Covenant of God is not outward but spiritual, as I have
said, and it is also free, even the free gift of God, and the promise
and Covenant is freely manifested without the performing any thing
by the creature to obtain it from God, for it stands not upon condi∣tion,
but upon free love and mercie; and many makes a profession of
faith which hath not right nor title to the inheritance of Salvation,
nor to Gods sure covenant, neither can anie upon earth, much lesse
<PB N="13" REF="7" MS="y"/>
Infants void o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> understanding, have any assurance or title in the Co∣venant
of life eternal, but who are regenerated and born of the elect
seed, for the unchanged and degenerated, in that state hath no ti∣tle
nor right in the Covenant, but <HI>Abrahams</HI> seed which is heir of the
promise, which is born of God and not from below, to that is the Co∣venant;
so thou hast spoken things thou knowest not, and hast mani∣fested
thy false principles which thou walkest in, and would cause o∣thers
to receive them also.</P>
<P><HI>Then thou speakest,</HI> of bread and wine, which (<HI>saist thou</HI>) are the out∣ward
signes in the Lords Supper, and are aseal of the Covenant also, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The supper of the Lord is the bread of eternal life, the bodie
and blood of Christ, and who eats thereof shall never die, nor hun∣ger
and thurst any more; and as for bread and wine visible and car∣nal,
that is not the real <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord, and even the purest insti∣tution
and practice thereof is but a representation of a thing, and not
the very thing, and the end and substance being come, the outward
sign may be neglected; But as for the manner and institution of that
practice in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the practise it selfe, we de∣ny
to be either a sign of good past, or to come; but in an Idolatrous
way it is leld forth, and not in any true honour to God; for he is
thereby dishonoured; for the false Church hath gotten the forme of
that practice as well as of many others, (which the true Church once
practised) without the power, and now doth practise many things,
in meer imitation and vain Idolatry, and in form and tradition, and
without the teaching of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which sometime the true Church
and the Apostles practised in the power, and by the leading of the
<HI>Spirit</HI> of God, and what the command of God was unto them; so
that though you may in some things practice the very same which
the Apostles did, yet having not the same <HI>Spirit</HI> to lead you, nor be∣ing
guided thereby as the saints and the Apostles were, your works
are but Idolatry and formal, and not accepted of the Lord, but stinks
in his nostrels, and your covenant is outward, and your seals out∣ward,
your Baptism and Supper outward and carnal, and while
you are with zeal prosecuting your outward proformances and fol∣lowing
them, you neglect the inward, and the substance, which is
Christ within you the hope of glory, which if he be in you, then the
body of sin is put off, and the vail is done away, and the representati∣ons
are done away, and the substance and salvation is come, and if
Christ be not in you, you are reprobates, notwithstanding all your
profession and practises of outward duties unto God without his
<HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="8" MS="y"/>
<HI>And whereas thou hast quoted,</HI> Col. 3. 10. Gal. 5. 17. Rom 7. 23. <HI>to
prove that</HI> the new man, the spirit or Law of the mind, is called the
imperfect Sanctification.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Hereby openly thou hast shewed thy self to be a perverter of
the Scriptures and a wrester of them to thy own destruction; for let
but reasonable men peruse the Scriptures mentioned by thee, and see
if there be such a thing in them as held forth by thee; that the new
man, the spirit or Law of the mind, is called imperfect Sanctifica∣tion,
which thou hast asserted, and cited those texts to prove it, but to
as to the thing it self I have answered before; onely this is to
shew, thy manner of perverting Scriptures; which is the work of the
evil spirit in thee, and not the work of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>And thus I have examined some part of thy principles of Religi∣on
which thou hast put forth into the world, for others to learn; and
the error and falsness of them is laid open, and how contrary to
the Scriptures they are, and in haste as it were, I have passed over
it, not willing to rake into things which gave no just occasion
against truth; but have onely confuted a few of thy many parti∣culars;
which had I narrowly sought into other things, much un∣soundness
would have been discovered; but what I have said is truly
sufficient to discover unto sober persons, the error of thy judge∣ment,
and of thy principles and practices, and of thy whole Re∣ligion;
and before ever thou be a true instructor of others in the
way, thou must first repent and believe, and learn the way thy self,
which yet thou are ignorant of; for thou hast shewed no knowledge
but what is sensual and devilish, and from below, and meerly
carnal, and natural; and meeting with thy book, and enquiring what
the Author was, I was engaged to say something to it by way of
Answer, and to lay it to the line of judgement according to the
Scriptures; and it hath proved very guilty of error, and perverting
Scriptures, and of corrupt principles; and in justice I could not but
condemn it, and if thou shall receive the conviction of thy error,
and of thy false doctrines by my answer, and repent, it shall prove
to thy good; but if thou shalt be stiff-necked, and harden thy heart,
then shall thy condemnation be the greater and thy Judgement the
more just; because God hath warned thee, and given thee a day of
visitation, and shewed thee the error of thy wayes and judgement
that thou mightest forsake thy transgressions, and be converted and
live; but whether thou shalt harden thy heart and remain in error,
or repent or turn from it; my reward is with the Lord, and in him
<PB N="15" REF="8" MS="y"/>
I have peace in this matter; whatsoever, thy mind shall be towards
me in my work; for I stand not to mans judgement while I cannot
be convinced of error in this business, and if thou shalt envy me,
and have wrath in thy heart towards me, because I have dealt to
plainly with thee in reproving of thee; then thou wilt but add to thy
own sin, and add more wrath up in store against thy self against
the time of thy judgement, and a greater burden will lie upon thy
conscience; wherefore consider of these things and let not the day
of thy visitation passe over, and be shut up with the night of dark∣ness,
and thou be everlastingly condemned; And if thou shalt vin∣dicate
thy own false principles, by answering to me again; thinking
to clear thy self, and to reprove me, that will not prove thy best
way because thou wants the truth and righteousness to stand by
thee; and to appear bold in a bad cause, will shew more wicked∣ness,
then sign of repentance; and if thou do answer a sound reply
will further unfold the misterie of iniquitie that lyes hid in thee,
and be thy greater shame; And as for thee and all the false Mini∣sters,
God hath discovered you, and you are made bare and naked,
and the false woman the Whore, your mother, her shame is dis∣covered
and her judgement is come, and God is avenging us on
her, and great <HI>Babylon</HI> is now come into remembrance before the
Lord, to bring her down to the ground, and you have long made a
prey upon the heritage of the Lord, and been spoilers thereof, ra∣ther
then builders of her breach, and she hath been troden down,
and not pittied by you; and as for your poor ignorant hearers they
lie in thick darkness, and loves to have it so; and the blind hath
led the blind, and yet the light is arising out of thick darkness, and
its appearance shall be glorious to expell all your errors, and that mist
of darkness that doth now cover them, and this light shall arise in
mens consciences, which shall discover the difference between every
false, and the right way; and all that take heed to the light shall
no longer sit in darkness nor in the shadow of death, but their steps
shall be directed in a perfect way; and the glory of the Lord shall
shine forth upon them, and this will the Lord bring to pass, and
hasten his work, and cut it short in righteousness, for his elects
sake.</P>
