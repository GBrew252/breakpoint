<HEAD>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>MY <HI>Blooming</HI> years, happen∣ing
to be in that sullen
<HI>Time,</HI> wherein nothing here but
<HI>Storms</HI> and <HI>Tempests</HI> appeared
were so blasted; that little else was
manifest in me, but what those sad
<HI>Disturbances</HI> had impressed; so
that, at the One and twentieth year
of my <HI>Age,</HI> I found <HI>Ambition</HI> to
outweigh my Natural Inclination:
which I had never discerned, had I
<PB REF="3"/>
not been overwhelm'd by the <HI>Provi∣dence</HI>
of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> and by
his great <HI>Judgments</HI> (both on <HI>Mind</HI>
and <HI>Body</HI>) brought to submit to his
<HI>Government.</HI> Whereupon, it was
clear to me, that the <HI>Actions</HI> of
<HI>Childhood</HI> had not so blemished my
Understanding, as youthful <HI>Ambi∣tion</HI>
had done: from hence, a
<HI>Strife</HI> arose in me, which ended
not, until (through <HI>Mercy)</HI> a right
<HI>Apprehension</HI> was given to me
again; by which, after some series
of time, I could and did willingly
turn out this <HI>Unnatural</HI> and
<HI>Haughty Guest.</HI> Hence procee∣ded
my <HI>Private Life,</HI> which hath
now continued for about Thirty three
years; and given being to my
<HI>Principles,</HI> and <HI>Practice;</HI> and
by Consequence birth to this <HI>Trea∣tise,</HI>
which is a brief Account of
<PB REF="3"/>
my frequent <HI>Experience,</HI> That be∣ing
an unquestionable <HI>Ground;</HI>
and every <HI>Thing,</HI> that hath not
its <HI>Original</HI> from some such unde∣niable
<HI>Principle,</HI> can never have
a certain <HI>Effect.</HI></P>
<P>To fear <HI>GOD,</HI> and love our
<HI>Neighbour,</HI> are <HI>Precepts,</HI> so
universally adhered to (as the
Summary of <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Moral
Acts)</HI> that <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians,
Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> have ever
subscribed to them; notwithstand∣ing
the various <HI>Forms,</HI> and <HI>Fi∣gures,</HI>
wherein they have been
represented. Therefore do I think,
that there is no sensible Man, but
must say, that <HI>Remedies</HI> of an
<HI>Universal Tendency,</HI> in which
all Apprehensions and Inclinations
agree, are more efficacious, safe,
certain and speedy, than any <HI>par∣ticular
<PB REF="4"/>
Remedy</HI> whatsoever,
whereof there are <HI>Doubts</HI> and
different <HI>Opinions;</HI> in as much
as <HI>Nature</HI> never varyes, in all
her <HI>Endeavours,</HI> from the <HI>Ca∣pacity,
Ordination</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of
every <HI>Individual;</HI> and that, which
all concur in, must needs be true:
so that, whatsoever <HI>Seed</HI> she ma∣nageth
to <HI>Generation,</HI> that still
produceth the uniform <HI>Figure</HI> and
<HI>Virtue,</HI> according to its Primitive
<HI>Appointment;</HI> unless by some
accidental <HI>Cause</HI> impeded. Never∣theless,
altho I seem in this whole
<HI>Treatise,</HI> to mind nothing but
<HI>Universal Dispositions;</HI> yet I
have bid fair for <HI>Particulars</HI> also,
as my Seven years living upon <HI>Ve∣getables</HI>
hath sufficiently demon∣strated,
and in that time my <HI>Exa∣minations</HI>
of their particular <HI>Vir∣tues;</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
not by <HI>Reading</HI> what others
have Written thereupon; but by
experimenting their <HI>Operation</HI> on
my own <HI>Body,</HI> and on others al∣so.
But, since I do not find them
useful, except particularly to some
<HI>Persons;</HI> and tho specifical to <HI>Di∣seases</HI>
of each kind, yet unable to
supply the <HI>Defects of Nature</HI> so
well as <HI>Things</HI> of an <HI>Universal
Tendency;</HI> being seldom singu∣larly
serviceable, till after other
<HI>Medicines</HI> are given: I presume
no ingenious Man will think I wholly
decry their use, but rather exalt
them in their proper place, intend∣ing
(in my <HI>Explanation</HI> of this
<HI>Treatise)</HI> to write more fully of
them, whereby it may be known
I have indeavour'd to understand the
use of <HI>Particulars,</HI> as well as of
<HI>Generals.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
But, let not any one think, the
<HI>Doctrine</HI> here asserted to be Novel;
for 'tis as ancient as <HI>Physic,</HI> or
<HI>Physicians;</HI> which <HI>Hermes Tris∣megistus</HI>
his <HI>Smaragdine Table</HI>
sufficiently declares, where he saith,
<HI>As is that, which is above, so
is that which is beneath; and
all is by the Mediation of One
Thing.</HI> Which true <HI>Position</HI> of
his hath been so far from being de∣nyed
by those <HI>Men,</HI> who have ob∣served
<HI>Nature</HI> in her secret <HI>Me∣anders,</HI>
from that <HI>Time,</HI> unto this
very <HI>Day,</HI> that <HI>None</HI> of common
<HI>Reason</HI> will or dare contradict the
same: for the <HI>Egyptian Learning</HI>
plainly enough demonstrates <HI>Hermes</HI>
to be their <HI>Prince;</HI> and their <HI>Hie∣roglyphicks</HI>
shew, that not <HI>Tra∣dition,</HI>
but <HI>Natural Sagacity</HI>
should be the Guide of all Inquisitive
<PB REF="5"/>
<HI>Minds,</HI> whereby to understand their
<HI>Powers</HI> and <HI>Actions.</HI> This was
so certainly believed in that <HI>Age,</HI>
that all the neighbouring <HI>Nations,</HI>
even in the Times of the <HI>Greeks,</HI>
sought knowledge no where, but in
that <HI>Place;</HI> and from thence the
same hath been derived to <HI>Us,</HI> as
appears by the <HI>Romans</HI> first admit∣ting
thereof, and bequeathing it to
our Climate. For, from <HI>Esculapius</HI>
his time, to <HI>Hippocrates</HI> (the <HI>14th</HI>
in Descent from him) it doth appear,
<HI>Nature</HI> was always allowed to be
the <HI>Physicianess</HI> of <HI>Diseases;</HI> and
from that time, unto this Day, none
have denied it; except such Men, as
sought <HI>Innovation,</HI> and thought
they could govern <HI>Nature</HI> better,
than she could govern her self. But
since that <HI>Age,</HI> there have risen a
sort of <HI>People,</HI> that did not so inge∣nuously
<PB REF="6"/>
follow <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI>
in the <HI>Investigation</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> as
their Predecessors did; but have (for
<HI>Interest</HI> sake, or else out of <HI>Igno∣rance</HI>
espoused, and imposed upon
the <HI>World</HI> false <HI>Doctrines</HI> suita∣ble
to their <HI>Ambitious</HI> or Covetous
<HI>Designs;</HI> whereby they have clouded
the Understandings of <HI>Men,</HI> and
introduced erroneous <HI>Positions,</HI> to
the shame of <HI>Sciences,</HI> and preju∣dice
of <HI>Mankind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aristotle,</HI> having a <HI>Monarch</HI>
to defend him, presumed to burn the
<HI>Books</HI> of his <HI>Ancestors;</HI> yet could
not fully confute, nor wholly smother
the <HI>Truth</HI> therein contained. By
these, and other like Means, the
very <HI>Tract</HI> of the <HI>Ancients</HI> is al∣most
wholly lost; and now Nothing,
but <HI>Nature</HI> her self, can restore
that to <HI>Man</HI> of which there are no
<PB REF="6"/>
plain <HI>Presidents,</HI> or evident <HI>Foot∣steps.</HI>
For, when <HI>Christians</HI> had
forsaken that <HI>Simplicity,</HI> which was
the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> and be∣came
Asserters and Ascribers of <HI>In∣fallibility</HI>
to themselves; then arose
the <HI>Roman</HI> Vicar, as their <HI>Dicta∣tor,</HI>
the <HI>Limiter, Bounder,</HI> and
<HI>Measurer</HI> of all Divine and Na∣tural
<HI>Things</HI> which they them∣selves
(being seized with <HI>Egyptian
Darkness)</HI> could not distinguish; so
that, if any new Matter was appre∣hended
and declared, which was not
affirmed by this Governor, death
ensued; as appeared by that <HI>German
Bishop,</HI> who (endeavouring to prove
the <HI>Antipodes)</HI> was condemned to
dye; because he had presumed to as∣sert
<HI>That,</HI> which was not approved by
this <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Church;</HI> and the
<HI>Learning</HI> which many <HI>Academicks</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
(at this Day) boast of, is not so much
the <HI>Result</HI> of <HI>Natural Sense,</HI> as of
that <HI>Politic Government.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless, these Men own and
acknowledg <HI>Hippocrates</HI> to be their
<HI>Patron;</HI> but did they (as they pre∣tend)
truly consider, and imitate him,
they would not force, but follow <HI>Na∣ture.</HI>
For, it appears (by his <HI>Rules</HI>
and <HI>Sayings)</HI> that <HI>Nature</HI> was his
<HI>Guide;</HI> because he taught, that
<HI>Matter,</HI> while crude, was not to be
expelled out of the <HI>Body;</HI> which is
a perfect <HI>Indication,</HI> that he would
have <HI>Us</HI> to expect a due time 'till
<HI>Nature</HI> shewed what she would have
performed, and when she expected
such assistance; and not to precipi∣tate
her into <HI>Actions,</HI> unto which
she had no tendency; and by taking
her off from her own work, to take
part with the <HI>Disease.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
The same <HI>Hippocrates</HI> long
since declared, that the <HI>Man,</HI>
who in all his <HI>Life</HI> brought forth
nothing, which was of <HI>Service</HI> or
<HI>Benefit</HI> to his <HI>Neighbour,</HI> de∣served
no remembrance among <HI>Men.</HI>
Therefore, if I have herein aimed
(according to my narrow <HI>Talent)</HI> to
be serviceable to <HI>Mankind,</HI> I am
thereby but a <HI>Disciple</HI> to that great
<HI>Master:</HI> yet, if what is contained
in this <HI>Treatise,</HI> be of any ad∣vantage
to <HI>Others,</HI> the thanks
thereof is not so much due to me,
as to my <HI>Opposers,</HI> whose <HI>Provo∣cations</HI>
have excited me to this
<HI>Vindication</HI> of my <HI>Proceedings;</HI>
like the <HI>Philosopher</HI>'s contrana∣tural
<HI>Fire,</HI> which (in destroying
the outward <HI>Form)</HI> excites the
inward <HI>Spirits</HI> to unite, and con∣center,
for their own <HI>Preserva∣tion;</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>
to the begetting or bringing
forth of some new <HI>Substance</HI> of
another <HI>Species.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Charge not on me the <HI>Scribe</HI>'s, or <HI>Prin∣ter</HI>'s faults,</L>
<L>Who see with <HI>Others Eyes;</HI> but they
whose <HI>Thoughts</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vulgar Opinion</HI> governs, are worse
blind:</L>
<L>In me the <HI>Organ</HI>'s <HI>dark,</HI> in them the <HI>Mind.</HI></L>

<HEAD>The First Part.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A
Manuduction,
DISCOVERING
The True Foundation of
the Art of Medicine.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Practice of Physick</HI> being
various, (and in the Judgment
of most very uncertain) be∣cause
the <HI>Galenists</HI> have one <HI>Theory,</HI>
and <HI>Chymists</HI> another; I cannot per∣ceive
any thing herein more service∣able
to the Publick, than to distin∣guish
their Foundations, and what use
I have made of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Galenists</HI> have 4 <HI>Humors, 4
Complexions,</HI> and 4 <HI>Qualities,</HI> to raise
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
their Structure on: And when either
of these exceed their due Tempera∣ment,
they judg a Disease present;
and to that apply their Remedies;
never so much as thinking of a Mo∣ver,
or first Cause of these Disor∣ders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chymists,</HI> according to <HI>Para∣celsus</HI>
and <HI>Helmont,</HI> establish their
<HI>Theory</HI> on the first disturbance given
to Nature in her own Inns, and Acts;
not so much respecting <HI>Effects</HI> as <HI>Cau∣ses,</HI>
nor the <HI>Matter</HI> disturbing, as the
<HI>Spirit</HI> disturbed: and to this they ap∣ply
their <HI>Remedies.</HI></P>
<P>This later Foundation, with me
(under great trouble of Spirit) at last
overcame all doubtings, and I readily
adhered to these sublime Concepti∣ons;
having for their Basis such per∣spicuity
as the Light of Nature did
really demonstrate, and <HI>Hippocrates,</HI>
their allowed <HI>Patron,</HI> doth attest, say∣ing;
<HI>Nature is the Physician and Cu∣rer
of Diseases.</HI> Yet, upon Examina∣tion
of their <HI>Remedies</HI> against this
Spiritual assault, or first being of
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<HI>Diseases,</HI> I perceived they depended
not upon any particular known Me∣dicines,
but on universal Dispositions,
drawn from Metals, Minerals, Salts,
Animals, or Vegetables. Hence, I be∣gan
to despair of arriving at any cer∣tainty
to attain <HI>Remedies</HI> so gifted,
as to be capable to reduce <HI>Nature</HI> to
her Primitive Unity with and in the
Faculties of the Body. For, I well
knew, that all the known Remedies
of these Times, were not the Medi∣cines
of our Famous Progenitors, nor
capable to answer to those Ends; be∣ing
the Products and Off-springs ei∣ther
of unfound <HI>Hearts,</HI> or ignorant
<HI>Heads,</HI> too much devoted to Gain
and Applause; who, having forsook
the Substance, embraced the Shadow;
and gave Names to Remedies, as <HI>Para∣celsick,</HI>
which have as much difference
from his in Disposition, as Light has
from Darkness. All their Medicines
were either endued with particular
Faculties, and hostile Dispositions, (as
Purging, and Vomiting, the Sound as
well as the Sick) or else curtailed by
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Fire, and fiery Spirits, and so rendred
<HI>Diaphoretical;</HI> under all which Con∣siderations,
they became wholly unfit
to answer that great End of <HI>Nature,</HI>
Curation.</P>
<P>I did not think those supream and
general gifts were wanting in Nature;
but (because I knew not the Artifice,
by which they might be attain'd)
they were to me as things of no value
or concern: having therefore suspend∣ed
my thoughts, till I better under∣stood
them, I greatly bent my Mind
to <HI>Animals, Salts,</HI> and <HI>Vegetables;</HI>
and from them endeavoured (as far
as in me lay) to separate their <HI>Ter∣restreity,</HI>
and by <HI>Mistion,</HI> their <HI>Specifi∣cality;</HI>
and having spiritualized them,
I found they were not unfit to be ad∣ministred
in any Case, so far, as com∣munication
of Strength was needful:
And so great a Blessing attended for
some space of time, that they seemed
to answer the utmost desires of Na∣ture.
Yet, my Mind being not idle
I allways feared, that this Success
might arise from the smallness of the
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Malignity, or the happy <HI>Genius</HI> that
prompted me to these Endeavours:
Nor was it long before my suspitions
proved truths. For, when I found some
Persons not cured, thô the Principal
Parts were not perished; and that
continual strife stirred up by Nature,
ended in her own Conquest; I posi∣tively
concluded, that those Medicines,
that were fit to stir up Action (if not
also endued with a Vitality, to keep
Nature in Union with and in her own
Organs, to act unto the time of
Death without loss of sensibility)
were far short of what a true Physi∣cian
should endeavour to compass.</P>
<P>Now was I again bewildred, my
Grief renewed, my Ignorance seemed
greater then at first, and my Labours I
undervalued as things of no Moment,
Books could not help, and Counsel
(at that time) among Men was not
to be hoped for. Therefore I accused
my self as rash in attempting that,
which seemed impossible to be attain∣ed;
and even despaired thereof. But,
considering in my self, that these my
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
endeavours had not their Original in
me by Education, nor by any Consi∣deration
of Profit or Honour, that
might accrew from the pursuit of the
same; but from a natural Propensity,
strongly overweighing my other In∣clinations,
which (at that time) to
my outward Man were pleasing e∣nough,
and not without great strife
fully subdued; I resigned my self to
the good Pleasure of the <HI>Highest,</HI> and
endeavoured Stilness more then Un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>Indeed I plainly viewed all things,
but would not discuss them so far, as
to raise any Foundation therefrom, or
to bring thoughtfulness in my Self.
For, I perceived a Disquisition of ought,
that stood not in Unity with all
things, would be particular, uncer∣tain,
and dangerous; yea, utterly un∣fit
to answer the ends of Nature: be∣cause
I found it wanting to the attain∣ment
of true Healing: and in this way
of simplicity I was found of <HI>What</HI>
I knew not how to search for: Na∣ture,
in stilness, brought forth that,
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
which Reason (without Light) could
never have acquired, even under its
most acute Scrutiny; For, it not be∣ing
sensible, there was no ground for
Reasoning.</P>
<P>In this opening, I saw, that every
Universal Remedy had its Root in the
first, or second Life of Minerals and
Metals; the last Life of them being ei∣ther
over-compact, or venomous. This
Aspect was grateful to me, and gave
me strong hope, that Time and Stilness
might produce more Evidence. Nor
was I deceived: for the way of de∣stroying
the last Life of some Sub∣jects
(endued with an Universal
Tendency) was in the Properties of
Nature made manifest to me. Then
did I see, as in a Glass, the wonderful
Gifts implanted in Metals, Minerals,
&amp;c. by the Pleasure of the Most
<HI>High,</HI> as a Relief to Mortals, in this
latter Age of the World; wherein
Diseases are increased and heightned
by various Venoms (the Relicts of
popular Distempers) and complica∣ted
through the Vices of Life, and
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
want of an unspotted vitality in our
original constitution. Besides, it ap∣pears
that the World it self waxeth
old, the Powers thereof are much
altered, all the external Virtues of its
Superficies are declined; but Metals
and Minerals, that have not known
the force of the external <HI>Air</HI> (the
great Propagator of Life and Corrup∣tion)
are less Partakers of the Uni∣versal
Debility, than those Things
which exist chiefly by that Air. Not
that they have not their <HI>Air</HI> also, but
it is otherwise qualified; rather to for∣ward
their Compaction, and concen∣trate
their Virtues, than to corrupt
them. By which means they seem
to be appointed (since, as to our
<HI>Air,</HI> they share an unspotted, un∣changeable
Life) as true Succours,
to withstand the Impressions of our
external <HI>Air,</HI> and the many Changes
and Complications of <HI>Diseases,</HI> that
reign amongst us. But <HI>Vegetables,</HI> by
reason of a seeming decay of Vigour in
the Elements, or the declining State of
the External Virtues of the Worlds
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
Superficies, (thô they have many
Excellent and Peculiar Endowments,
which wisely used may be sometimes
serviceable in the Cure of the Sick;
when freed from their <HI>Terrestreity</HI>
and <HI>Grossness,</HI> that in their Reception,
they put not <HI>Nature</HI> to too much
trouble of <HI>Digestion)</HI> yet, if they be
not so universalized by <HI>Vnition,</HI> that
they no longer serve under their par∣ticular
Gifts, they indeed cannot con∣tribute
any thing to <HI>Nature</HI> in her
most deplorable <HI>Cases:</HI> Whereas, <HI>Mi∣neral</HI>
and <HI>Metalick</HI> Virtues, being
more concentrate, have more univer∣sal
<HI>Dispositions;</HI> and so are more fit
to serve <HI>Nature,</HI> to all intents, than
the other. For, <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals</HI>
are not specificated to this or that
<HI>Person,</HI> or to this or that <HI>Disease;</HI> but
to the Properties of <HI>Nature,</HI> in her
first Operation in Bodies: by which
indeed, as to the noble parts of principal
<HI>Members,</HI> one Mineral or Metal may
be more suitable, than another; but,
as to <HI>Diseases</HI> and <HI>Persons,</HI> there they
solely act according to <HI>Nature's</HI> de∣ficiency
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
and so become true <HI>Succours:</HI>
because, when they are prepared as
requisite, they are not transchanged
in the <HI>Body,</HI> the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Vigour,</HI> or
<HI>Ray</HI> of them being the <HI>Medicine.</HI> So
that the <HI>Substance</HI> of them passeth
away unalter'd as to weight; and
therefore not being touched by our
<HI>Ferments,</HI> bringeth less trouble to
<HI>Nature,</HI> than one spoonful of <HI>Wine</HI>
would do; And this is, because there
is no reaction of <HI>Nature</HI> upon them,
as in other <HI>Medicines:</HI> but if they be
administred in so weak a state, as be∣fore
separation of the form they are
cast out by the Draught, then they are
altogether useless.</P>
<P><HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals</HI> have their
Gifts from GOD, not from Man's
Art: For Art doth not confer Virtue,
but by separating the <HI>Shell</HI> discovers
the <HI>Kernel:</HI> And their implanted <HI>Vir∣tues</HI>
are for our benefit; posited there
and not to be concealed, neglected or
slighted, as things not to be used; be∣cause
<HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Ignorance</HI> have con∣demned
them: for, by that means, the
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
End of their Creation would be fru∣strated;
which will seem to the Ratio∣nal
an evil conceit. Shall <HI>Wheat</HI> be
contemned as unfit for nourishment,
because it hath husks? or <HI>Almonds</HI> for
their hard Shells?</P>
<P>I write not of the external <HI>Proper∣ties</HI>
of <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals,</HI> but of
their inward <HI>Parts,</HI> in which is con∣centred
a more vital <HI>Air</HI> than in other
things, by which they famously ma∣nifest
their Universal <HI>Disposition. Air,</HI>
we see, above all things visible, re∣fresheth
<HI>Man;</HI> Now, the Air inclosed
in them is of an unsearchable power,
purity, and penetration, beyond what
is in any single <HI>Concrete;</HI> more friend∣ly
than ours, wherein we breath; for
though it be lyable to it's Laws for
transchangement, yet its Virtues in
order to Sanity are thereby not dimi∣nished.
But, the external <HI>Parts</HI> of
<HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals</HI> are indeed ve∣nomous,
and may justly be censured
as altogether unfit to be relyed on, for
<HI>Succour</HI> in <HI>Diseases;</HI> because they com∣pel
<HI>Nature</HI> to <HI>Expulsion,</HI> and are not
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
subservient to her, in exciting natural
Vigour, except against their own poy∣sonous
hostility. Therefore, what
hath been, or shall be writ, concern∣ing
this, must not be understood of
the <HI>Exterior Parts</HI> of <HI>Metals</HI> or <HI>Mi∣nerals,</HI>
or of the <HI>Medicines</HI> made
thereof, which are commonly known;
but of such <HI>Medicines,</HI> as truly per∣form
what I have specified, by assist∣ing
<HI>Nature,</HI> and are so vastly different
from those of Common Use, that their
subsequent Operation can never be
declared, before they are taken: to
day they have one Action, to morrow
another, and the third Day another, as
the <HI>Diseases</HI> happen to be changed by
their <HI>Virtues.</HI> As for <HI>Instance;</HI></P>
<P>In all Acute <HI>Diseases,</HI> if much ma∣terial,
<HI>Vomits, Stools,</HI> or <HI>Vrine</HI> are
largely provoked; and then after∣wards,
<HI>Sweats;</HI> but after the <HI>Feavers</HI>
are extinguished, then <HI>Stools</HI> again,
till the <HI>Relicts</HI> are removed. But in
acute <HI>Diseases,</HI> where there is more
depression of <HI>Spirit,</HI> and less <HI>Matter,</HI>
there <HI>Sweats</HI> arise at first, and conti∣nue
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
dayly till the Evil be overcome;
and then <HI>Stools</HI> for a <HI>Day</HI> or two, ac∣cording
to the <HI>Relict,</HI> and so they
cease acting. And all this is effected
by the same <HI>Medicines;</HI> which, if
continued from the Beginning to the
End of <HI>Distempers,</HI> will clearly mani∣fest
these <HI>Properties.</HI></P>
<P>Now, can any One imagin, that
this variety of <HI>Actions,</HI> in one and the
same <HI>Medicine,</HI> in the same <HI>Body,</HI> and
in the same <HI>Disease,</HI> is any thing else,
than the <HI>Action</HI> of <HI>Nature?</HI> seeing it
is evident, that Vomiting and Purging
<HI>Medicines</HI> never become <HI>Sweaters</HI> or
<HI>Binders,</HI> except <HI>Nature,</HI> through In∣capacity
of expelling them (falling
under the Burthen of their Venome)
sends forth <HI>Sweats,</HI> as <HI>Signs</HI> of an evil
<HI>Guest.</HI></P>
<P>Whatsoever therefore doth so di∣rectly
fortify <HI>Nature,</HI> as to make her
act every way suitable to her own
Necessities, cannot be any other than
Virtue; and seeing it hath pleased
GOD to implant such Virtues and
Powers, in <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals,</HI> no
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
unbyass'd person will say 'tis unfit
they should be inquir'd into.</P>
<P><HI>Medicines</HI> thus endowed are more
safe than others, as never performing
ought that can be injurious, seeing
<HI>Nature</HI> only manageth them, and they
<HI>Purge</HI> not when they should pro∣voke
<HI>Sweat;</HI> nor do they <HI>Vomit,</HI> when
purging by <HI>Vrine</HI> or <HI>Perspiration</HI> is
required; they leave no Relicts in the
Body, for they are clean, having all
unnatural Impurities removed. The
<HI>Child</HI> new born, the <HI>Woman</HI> new layd,
the most aged and most weak safely
take them, without any the least dam∣mage
ensuing therefrom.</P>
<P>I write not this conjecturally, but
from the <HI>Experience</HI> of more than
Twenty Years. For, these <HI>Remedies,</HI>
having an universal Tendency (not
working by <HI>Vomit, Stool,</HI> or <HI>Sweat</HI>
upon the sound) do only in the Sick
Operate, as <HI>Nature</HI> findeth most con∣venient,
and so are only her <HI>Servants:</HI>
but other <HI>Medicines,</HI> that have not so
universal a <HI>Disposition,</HI> thô in former
<HI>Ages</HI> (when <HI>Diseases</HI> were more sim∣ple,
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
and had rarely any thing extra∣ordinary
in them) they might be ve∣ry
profitable, yet now they cannot be
used without <HI>Danger.</HI> For, where <HI>Na∣ture</HI>
her self is undetermined, a <HI>Remedy,</HI>
that hath not a Gift to reach the Life,
and strengthen her to compose those
Confusions, that cause so great a Com∣plication,
and indetermination, may
indeed by its particular act alter the
<HI>Scene,</HI> but not the <HI>Tragedy;</HI> and change
the <HI>Seat</HI> of a <HI>Disease</HI> from one <HI>Bowel</HI>
to another; but if any do impartially
observe the <HI>Event,</HI> they will soon
perceive; that the change of <HI>Place</HI>
hath rendred the <HI>Disease</HI> (before easi∣ly
cured) not curable, unless with
great difficulty; and not at all, but
by <HI>General, Remedies.</HI> Yet, let no
Man mistake me so far, as to think
these <HI>Medicines</HI> (I mention) to be
very easily obtained: No, the Com∣mon
Preparations have no such Endow∣ments;
Nor can the converting of a
<HI>Vomitive</HI> and <HI>Purging Medicine,</HI> into
a <HI>Diaphoretick,</HI> render its Gifts more
splendid: nay, rather, what before in
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
it self had an universal <HI>Disposition,</HI> is
now become only a particular <HI>Be∣medy,</HI>
being no otherwise serviceable,
than where <HI>Sweats</HI> are needful. And
it is clear to every skilful Labourer in
the way of natural Medicines, that
every universal <HI>Being,</HI> tormented by
Fire or fiery Spirits, is not bettered
thô changed: For every direct Change
is a diminishing of the Natural Gift;
And whosoever spends his time this
way to alter General Medicines,
will injure both himself and his
Neighbour, and shall never arrive to
any certainty in the true Matter of
<HI>Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>The outward Life of Metals or Mi∣nerals
is poyson, which unless over∣come,
with Conservation of the <HI>Spe∣cies</HI>
of them, they cannot exhibit
their natural Gifts. For Mineral Vir∣tues
are like Lillies among Thorns:
if a Man remove not these, he will be
wounded with their Prickles, before
he can attain the Sweetness of those.
The outward life of Minerals must
dye and be annihilated; their middle
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Life is <HI>Medicine, Antidote</HI> against
Poyson, an Exhilirator and Server of
Nature, without any determinate
Action; a great Light, impressed with
a Divine Seal, capable to extirpate
the Characters of diseasy Images, or
at least to subvert their Acts; having
a natural faculty to remove every oc∣casional
Matter, by Nature's own
Power; not compelling but exciting
Her, as hath been sensibly experimen∣ted.
This proved to me the Truth
of <HI>Helmont</HI>'s Theory, which thô be∣lieved,
yet without this Testimonial
Act, I might (with the generality of
<HI>Searchers)</HI> have ruined my Self, by
adhering to what was visible, and sup∣posing
what I enjoyed not, as impos∣sible
to be attained. For every true
Natural <HI>Medicine</HI> worketh not by its
own Power (which is ever inimical to
<HI>Nature)</HI> to Vomit, Purge, Sweat, pro∣voke
Urine, &amp;c. but by <HI>Nature</HI>'s di∣spose;
being such as never operates
on Bodies well and in health, althô
taken in a six-fold quantity; nor on
the diseased and sick, but in the way
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<HI>Nature</HI> finds most conducent to health.
Because <HI>Nature</HI> is the <HI>Physicianess,</HI>
and all that is ministred to her, ought
to be at her Dispose. And that she
knoweth how to use <HI>Medicines</HI> of an
universal Disposition, appeareth, in
that she doth by them Purge, Vomit
or Sweat, where occasion is; and that
as forcibly and sensibly, as the strong∣est
direct Medicines can do; yet with
so different Success, that Sweats, thô
endured for many daies, do not wea∣ken
so much as others (thô only for
some hours) excited by a forcible <HI>Dia∣phoretick;</HI>
Nay, the <HI>Patients▪</HI> each
day grow stronger and stronger, than
the first Day of taking them. So like∣wise,
in Vomiting and Purging, there
is no debility of <HI>Nature,</HI> thô they
work many Weeks together, in such
a measure, that the gentlest of direct
<HI>Purgers</HI> (if used so long, and wrought
after the same manner) would bring
to <HI>Death</HI>'s dore, if not totally extin∣guish
Life: but these separate the oc∣casional
Matter only, and weaken not.
Besides these Properties mentioned,
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
that prove their Subserviency, (which
is but the dark part of <HI>Vniversal Re∣medies)</HI>
there are other more vital
<HI>Separations,</HI> which manifest their <HI>En∣dowments;</HI>
insomuch, that the very
same <HI>Medicines</HI> that did provoke, do
also stay <HI>Vomiting,</HI> repress unnatural
<HI>Sweats,</HI> stop <HI>Fluxes,</HI> cure the <HI>Dysen∣tery</HI>
and <HI>Gripings of the Guts,</HI> as also
all <HI>Fluxes</HI> of the <HI>Womb,</HI> white or red;
stay the <HI>Menses</HI> if inordinate, and bring
them down when stopped; hinder
<HI>Abortion,</HI> further the <HI>Birth</HI> when
ripe; prevent the <HI>After-pains,</HI> yet
cleanse more securely, than any <HI>Spe∣cifick</HI>
whatsoever; dissolve or ripen
<HI>Imposthumes,</HI> transmit seemingly fixed
<HI>Tumors</HI> from one part to another, so
as <HI>sensible Tumors</HI> of the <HI>Womb,</HI> have
by the use of them become <HI>Im∣posthumes</HI>
of the <HI>Abdomen:</HI> an Action,
if well noted, of no small Advantage
to the <HI>Sick,</HI> and of great Comfort to
an honest <HI>Ingenious Physician.</HI> I have
also known Urine (in a great Obstru∣ction
thereof, contrary to the Com∣mon
course of <HI>Nature,</HI> yet naturally)
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
vented through the fleshy parts about
the Kidneys; and that in such a Quan∣tity,
as was not inconsiderable, had it
been voided the usual way: thô this
continued no longer, than the Ob∣struction
was separating; for then
<HI>Nature</HI> assumed her usual Passages.
And for a Crown to the <HI>Reality</HI> of
<HI>Vniversal Medicines,</HI> I shall add; They
more powerfully excite <HI>Nature</HI> by in∣sensible
<HI>Transpiration,</HI> than by all the
usual <HI>Passages;</HI> which Operation (If
<HI>Physicians</HI> be not stark blind) is of
more service a Thousand fold, espe∣cially
in our days, than Purging, Vo∣miting,
Sweating, &amp;c. were it not the
grand unhappiness of Mankind, to
measure the offices of their Living
Spirits, by the Effects and Consequen∣ces
of their intemperate Lives. For
these <HI>Remedies</HI> of an universal <HI>Ten∣dency,</HI>
exciting <HI>Nature</HI> to <HI>Insensible
Transpiration,</HI> perform that part of
<HI>Medicine,</HI> which is least minded, thô
of greatest Concernment; and althô
of late years it hath been conceded to,
as true, because sensibly experimented;
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
yet the <HI>Medium,</HI> by which it is per∣formed,
is a mystery to the greater
part of <HI>Physicians.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed to more sensible, and
less disputable Actions, (what hath
been already specified being most cer∣tain,
because so often known by my
Self) Nothing, below an Universal
<HI>Tendency,</HI> is capable of such different
Operations, nor can it be so disposed,
as <HI>Nature</HI> may be capable by the
same, to extravert the introversate, and
that without Damage to the Parts or
Organs, since it is not given to <HI>Nature</HI>
to create Gifts, but to use them.</P>
<P>For every particular <HI>Remedy,</HI> thô
most pure, cannot be extended beyond
its Gift: As for Instance; The pu∣rest
<HI>Stomachical,</HI> that hath Gifts to
fortifie, to cleanse and separate the
Impurities of that <HI>Part,</HI> not being in∣dowed
with an Universal Disposition
to strengthen <HI>Nature</HI> (to war against
those dark Images she hath conceived,
and by that means impressed on an∣other
Digestion) and also a Capacity
of removing occasional Causes; it
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
shall indeed corroborate the part for
the present, but at the same time shall
separate the Impurity thereof to
other Digestions, and so rather render
the Party worse: because, the Root
of the Disease being in the <HI>Archeus,</HI>
and that <HI>Specifick</HI> is uncapable of com∣municating
ought thereunto (except
what concerned that particular
<HI>Bowel)</HI> the Disease it self must neces∣sarily
be increased in the place to
which it is transferr'd, and never be
subdued, until the <HI>Darkness,</HI> over∣whelming
the Spirit, shall be driven
away; or the occasional Matter (in
which those <HI>Idea's</HI> are impressed) nul∣lify'd.</P>
<P>Whence it is clear in the <HI>Light</HI> of
<HI>Nature,</HI> That <HI>Remedies</HI> of an Univer∣sal
Disposition are essential to true
healing. Not that I judge <HI>Specificks</HI>
altogether useless; because I certainly
know, that the great Art of <HI>Physicians</HI>
consisteth in finding out and fitly ap∣plying
the same: yet with this <HI>Pro∣viso,
Viz.</HI> That thay suit to Parts and
the Operations thereof, and be univer∣salized
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
as to Persons, so, that the sad,
the merry, the cold, and hot Consti∣tutions
may thence reap a like Bene∣fit;
which is no such hard matter to
accomplish: For, if a <HI>Specifick</HI> be fer∣mented
with an <HI>Vniversal,</HI> by this
means it is made more general, and
mindeth not Constitutions, but the of∣fended
<HI>Part,</HI> in the Operations thereof.
Yet these <HI>Remedies</HI> must be used with
great Judgment; because all <HI>Speci∣ficks</HI>
have a direct <HI>Action,</HI> (whether
they be <HI>Acidums</HI> or <HI>Alkalies, Aperi∣tives,
Diureticks, Diaphoreticks, Vo∣miting,
Purging, Resolving, Separating,
Contracting</HI> or <HI>Coagulating Medicines)</HI>
and if unduly or unseasonably apply∣ed,
are direct <HI>Evils.</HI> For, whosoever
giveth a <HI>Diaphoretick</HI> in the begin∣ing
of a <HI>Feaver,</HI> before any Digestion
happens in the <HI>Febrile Matter,</HI> doth
by the same indeed produce <HI>Sweats,</HI>
but to the great disadvantage of the
<HI>Sick:</HI> because that Action of the <HI>Me∣dicine,</HI>
contrary to the disposition of
<HI>Nature,</HI> carrieth the more subtile
parts of the occasional Cause into the
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
Blood. And besides, the <HI>Sweating
Remedy,</HI> because not gifted to streng∣then
<HI>Nature,</HI> and incline her to her
own Acts, leaves the more gross and
oft-times uncoctable diseasy <HI>Matter</HI> in
the <HI>Stomach;</HI> which proves fatal to
the <HI>Patient;</HI> or at least renders the
Disease difficult to be healed. There∣fore
<HI>Specificks,</HI> thô never so pure or
certain, and having an universal <HI>Fer∣ment,</HI>
but not having thereby univer∣sal
<HI>Gifts,</HI> cannot be used generally
without apparent danger: thô, in de∣fects
of Parts and Faculties, where
<HI>Nature</HI> indicates her own Wants, they
act more swiftly and certainly than
<HI>Remedies</HI> more general. Yet it hath
been obvious to me by manifold Ob∣servations,
that direct working Medi∣cines,
given in the beginning of <HI>Disea∣ses,</HI>
have generally injured the Persons
afflicted; by removing the offensive
Matter to places, where <HI>Nature</HI> (with∣out
that force) would never have
done.</P>
<P>Let any One but observe the Pro∣gress
of Malignant <HI>Feavers, Small
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
Pox, Plague,</HI> &amp;c. and he must necessa∣rily
discern, that any Purging <HI>Remedy,</HI>
thô but a <HI>Clyster,</HI> (because <HI>Nature</HI>
endeavours to make separation an∣other
way by the Skin) doth notably
hinder the then needful and necessary
Expulsion; and, by attracting inward,
brings Death, or a very great danger
thereof. Now, althô in these Acute
Diseases, by reason of their swift Mo∣tion
and sudden determination, Errors
are more obvious; yet are they as cer∣tainly
committed in the Chronical
and more slow <HI>Distempers,</HI> and attend∣ed
with the same Consequences, thô
longer before they be manifested. For,
whensoever, by direct <HI>Remedies,</HI> the
Diseasy-Matter is transmitted from
one Digestion to another, must it not
unavoidably be rendred worse? and
what was Originally an Evil in
the <HI>Stomach</HI> or <HI>Spleen,</HI> if carried to
the <HI>Gaul</HI> or <HI>Liver,</HI> (and there hurting
the Actions and Parts of the same)
shall it not be more difficult to cure,
seing those Bowels are remote from
the Stomach, and have a different
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
Digestion, and are not so easily reach∣ed
by Physick? For, as Mustiness in a
Barrel affects <HI>Wine, Beer,</HI> or <HI>Vinegar,</HI>
with the same Odour; so doth it in
like manner affect any urinous Li∣quor.
How much more shall diseasy
<HI>Ferments,</HI> if by separation, without
being overcome (which no Purgative
Remedy can do) they be carried to
the <HI>Duodenum,</HI> necessarily infect the
adjacent Parts? Also, if I understand
any thing in Nature, the original of
all Chronical Diseases, that are not
seminal, proceeds rather from the
Errors of <HI>Physicians,</HI> or the unruliness
of <HI>Patients,</HI> than from the <HI>Weakness</HI>
of <HI>Nature,</HI> or strength of increasing
Diseases. For, it is almost daily seen,
that one Disease is changed into an∣other;
not as progressing naturally
thereto, but through irregular Pra∣ctice,
by Purging, Bleeding, Sweating,
and other direct Actions; whereby
acute Diseases become Chronical, and
Chronical Acute; by the one making
the Life miserable, and by the other
inferring sudden Death. Which may
<PB N="27" REF="21"/>
easily be demonstrated, and I intend
something thereof, when I shall treat
of the Progress of Diseases.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is very manifest, that
particular Medicines (how prevalent
soever to any particular Part, and the
Disease thereof) where a Complicati∣on
of Diseases is present, act rather
against than with Nature; because
they cannot be imployed by Her a∣gainst
the Complication, or the Ori∣ginal
of the defective Part, for such
Remedies, acting particularly, and not
generally, by cleansing the Part ren∣der
it more fit for Reception of the
Complicating Evil. So that, by such
irregular Practices, Diseases of the first
Digestion consequently become Dis∣tempers
of the second or third, &amp;c.
And this is, because Diseases of the
first Digestion, not being there sub∣dued,
but carried thence to the se∣cond
or third, put on another Nature;
and sometimes become complicated,
thô simple before, through a natural
disposedness to receive all depending
Evils of the Place the diseased live in,
<PB N="28" REF="22"/>
or of the time or season of the Year,
or of the Parts they possess. For, when
Diseases once degenerate, they are ex∣cited
<HI>(Nature</HI> growing weaker) by
every adjacent Evil: whereas in their
first assault, one Digestion alone being
concerned, <HI>Nature</HI> can much more
easily overcome them.</P>
<P>If I thought what is here expressed
were not sufficient to prove the Truth
of this Matter, I could easily demon∣strate
the same, by the Practice, ei∣ther
of <HI>Patients</HI> not timely using <HI>Re∣medies,</HI>
or of <HI>Physicians</HI> using things
improper. For, I do not find Chro∣nical
Diseases (in their beginnings) to
have took Root in Us, except from
the above specified Errors. And althô
some seminal Dispositions derived from
<HI>Parents</HI> (labouring under the same
Affects) may beget diseasy Inclina∣tions;
yet they, not being able to act
without Matter, may well be sub∣dued,
or at least kept from further In∣crease,
if General Means be timely
used; unless some principal Vessel be
naturally deficient.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="22"/>
Every seminal Disposition is incor∣poreal,
till Matter (through debility
of <HI>Nature)</HI> be conjoyned with it; for
then it becomes active and a Disease:
but if the Matter, which is the occa∣sional
Evil, be removed, the Action
ceaseth. Now, this Matter at the first
is easily expelled in a short time;
because, every such occasional Matter
is first manifested in the <HI>Stomach.</HI> But
when the seminal Disposition and that
Matter have moved each with other
any time, strange <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rments</HI> are begot∣ten,
and the Actions of divers Parts
injured thereby. Then indeed <HI>Medi∣cines,</HI>
thô never so speedy in the be∣ginning,
cannot do much, but require
length of time, by reason of the Com∣plication,
which happens through the
many Digestions damnified. For, in
the first Motion thereof, the first Di∣gestion
is but begun to be defiled
therewith, and strives against it: then
Universal Medicines can easily contest
with the Matter, and in small time
overcome; because the Disease is yet
undeterminate and floating; no Dis∣ease
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
of any denomination having Ex∣istence
in the Body (except where
some Vessel or Part is hurt) till the
first Digestion submitteth to it, as an
admitted Guest, and ceasing to strive
against it, sends Superfluities (as Nou∣rishment)
thereunto. This is apparent
in every true <HI>Gout;</HI> Before the <HI>Pa∣roxysm</HI>
begins, Loathing at the Sto∣mach,
and a restless Disposition is per∣ceived
for a Day or two, and the Pain
never approacheth, till the Burthen
be thence removed; thô indeed, the
Torture which happens afterward,
doth many times cause, as it were, a
Loathing: Yet that is rather the Ef∣fect
of Anguish, than of Matter. For,
whereas at the first, these Universal
Remedies work upon the Matter, by
Vomits, Sweats, Stools, or Urine, and
when the Pains exist in the Joynts,
have no action at all; yet when the
Dolours are removed, then they ope∣rate
the same way again. And this
is a sufficient proof of the possibility
of keeping even Hereditary Diseases,
from growing, or increasing to any
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
great height, by General Medicines,
if seasonably applyed.</P>
<P>These General Dispositions of Me∣dicines
here treated of, are singularly
useful, to keep <HI>Physicians</HI> from Error;
because Medicines of an Universal
Tendency do manifest the Distempers
of particular Parts; and (as with the
Finger) point at the Seats of Diseases,
beyond the Imagination of Any, that
have not proved them: for they most
sensibly act on the diseased Part. And,
where such Medicines are first admi∣nistred,
there particular <HI>Remedies,</HI> that
are specifick to Parts, have afterwards
the greater efficacy: because <HI>Nature</HI>
being assisted in General, doth readily
dispose of the Particular, according to
its Gift also. For, althô they cannot
cure every Disease, yet their clearing
the first Digestion, by strengthen∣ing
and removing the Evil thereof,
cause the particular Medicine to act,
without any stop, upon the affected
part. And by this method it is, that
Distempers accounted uncurable, have
often been cured.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="24"/>
But the great Occasions of Errors
committed in the Medicinal Faculty,
are:</P>
<P>1. Ignorance of <HI>Nature,</HI> what she
is able to do.</P>
<P>2. Want of Knowledg of the possi∣bility
of Remedies to be so universal
in their nature, as to do, or leave un∣done,
as it most conduceth to <HI>Nature's</HI>
help.</P>
<P>3. The grand mistake of Practitio∣ners,
touching the Causes of Diseases;
judging all Distempers to have their
Original from Humorous filths, and
in the mean while never thinking of
<HI>Venoms</HI> arising through <HI>Ferments▪</HI>
much less of the <HI>Spirit</HI> that makes
the Assault. For, althô they hourly
see the Effects of <HI>Anger, Sorrow, Envy,
Fear,</HI> &amp;c. yet, when they apply Re∣medies,
the first obvious Cause, that
turns the whole frame of Man, is not
consider'd by them; and only what
they produce is the Subject against
which their Medicines are directed.</P>
<P>As for Example: When <HI>Rage</HI> kind∣leth
<HI>Choler,</HI> they seek to allay <HI>Choler,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
that is only the product of <HI>Rage. Cho∣ler</HI>
maketh not Men angry, but <HI>Anger</HI>
conceived maketh that sensible; For
Nothing liveth, but hath enough of
that Juice (so called) to be in Rage
sufficiently, yet unless the Spirit be de∣filed
by a wrathful Image, there is
no sense of it apparent.</P>
<P>So also, when our thoughts are
greatly exercised with a strong desire
to attain what is unknown, the <HI>Con∣stringing
Fiat</HI> presently ferments the
<HI>Chyle</HI> with so great a sharpness, through
the Contraction of the Spirit in that
<HI>Exercise,</HI> that it is manifest in the
<HI>Gust,</HI> or sensible <HI>Tast,</HI> and is in <HI>Nature</HI>
the Cause of what is called <HI>Melancho∣ly;</HI>
but, if persevered in so long till
Separation happen, without great
helps, a certain distraction is produ∣ced,
or some violence that is worse.</P>
<P><HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> have not much
different Effects, for the former cause,
when they are conjoyned with a
strong desire, except that Madness
hence does more rarely happen; yet
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
in that Cold dark harsh fire they im∣pregnate
the <HI>Chyle,</HI> and induce great
Leaness on the Body, harshness and
darkness in the Skin and Hair, and are
not curable any more than the other,
by any Means applied to the Humour:
For, althô that be altered by the
force of <HI>Physick</HI> to day, and wholly
separated; yet if the Spirit strenuously
persist in the same Design, the Disease
(in the twinkling of an Eye) is gene∣rated
again: because, what is once
done, may be done a second time, and
needs not any intervening <HI>Agent.</HI> Al∣thô
'tis true, that Matter once gene∣rated,
augments the Evil, and increa∣seth
the Darkness so largely, that the
Spirit is thereby more materiated,
more exasperated, and in greater An∣guish.</P>
<P><HI>Fear</HI> stagnizes the Blood, brings
Coldness, Sighing, intermittent Pulses,
Convulsions, and (if strongly persist∣ed
in) sudden Death, or great Stupi∣dity.
Now, it is true, that in case
the occasion of <HI>Fear</HI> be removed, it
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
is no hard matter to conquer the Ef∣fects;
And so, it is consequently true
in other <HI>Idea's:</HI> but if continued in,
thô but in a mere dejection, or sink∣ing
of the Life, they are rendred more
difficult to cure, than the more evil
and active Passions.</P>
<P><HI>Sorrow</HI> is accompanied with debi∣lity
of <HI>Faculties,</HI> a pining away of the
Body, and a wasting of the Spirits;
and is a <HI>Causer</HI> of <HI>Pains</HI> in peculiar
<HI>Vessels,</HI> through the alteration of
<HI>Chyle,</HI> (the Parent of manifold Evils)
yet if once overcome, the Effects are
not long in expelling, thô they have
altered almost all the Constitution.</P>
<P>Now, in as much as 'tis evident,
that <HI>Disturbance</HI> of the Spirit is the
<HI>Generator</HI> of defects in the Body; can
it be thought, that real <HI>Venomes</HI> (whe∣ther
<HI>Epidemical, Endemical,</HI> or <HI>Arti∣ficial)</HI>
shall less distast then the afore∣mentioned
Conceptions; since they
absolutely assault the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and en∣deavour
the Extirpation of Vital Light?
the former arise as well from feigned
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
as real Objects; the later only from
real, active, and (after a sort) living
<HI>Essences:</HI> therefore in reason more
perceptible, and causes of greater
<HI>Wrath, Fear, Stupor, Sorrow,</HI> or irre∣gular
Action in our <HI>Nature;</HI> unless
we think every thing is agitated by
<HI>Necessity,</HI> as Sparks fly upward, and
that there is no living Understanding
and Election in Us. But, if we bring
these things to a sensible <HI>Test,</HI> it can∣not
be denyed, but that we feel the
force of <HI>Anger, Fear,</HI> &amp;c. in our Bodies;
which, if the Spirit in Us were not
the <HI>Ruler,</HI> could never be so.</P>
<P>Yet, to come nearer to our <HI>Selves:</HI>
Do not trivial Errors, even of <HI>Meats</HI>
and <HI>Drinks, Heats</HI> and <HI>Colds,</HI> prima∣rily
affect the <HI>Spirit?</HI> Who is there,
whom fulness of Meats and Drinks
doth not affect with Dulness and Hea∣viness?
Do not Heats, when over∣much,
cause Faintings and Languish∣ments;
and doth not the <HI>Supplement</HI>
of Cordials (actual or potential) sup∣ply
that defect? Likewise, is it not
apparent, that <HI>Cold</HI> (when offensive)
<PB N="37" REF="26"/>
stagnizeth the Bloud, giveth Cause
for dolour in the external Parts to
Imposthumous Humors; or stirs up
Disorders internally, through the let
of vital Separations; and is usually
the <HI>Begetter</HI> (if the Spirit be not help∣ed
to perform its natural Separations)
of Vomitings, Fluxes, Feavers, Coughs,
and what not, through the obstruct∣ing
of the vital Spirit? Yet how∣ever,
this can be no more than the
Occasional Cause; the Efficient must
be the Spirit erring in its own Acts,
that must constitute this formal part
of distemperature, and bring it to a
Disease. And doth any thing sooner
restore Nature to her wonted Action,
than such things as fortifie her, and
help forward Transpiration, which the
Cold letted? Also, it is very clear,
that if any one, upon the first Sense of a
Distemper, doth but use such Univer∣sal
Means, as can keep Nature to act
without disturbance; he will certain∣ly
find, that all these Distempers (so
generally afflicting) are driven away
almost as soon as they came. For, by the
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
first Assault, the <HI>Archeus</HI> is only con∣fused,
and hath not throughly im∣pressed
the obstructed Matter with a
diseasy Character. And this my <HI>Pa∣tients</HI>
do generally find true, inso∣much
that for many years, few of
them know ought of a compleat Dis∣ease,
unless they neglect their Reme∣dies
in the beginning.</P>
<P>For every Medicine of an Univer∣sal
Tendency is gifted from above, to
withstand the Formation of Diseases
(if the Internal Spirit hath not given
to them a Seminal Being) inasmuch
as it addeth Power and Activity to
Nature, through the Light and Life
that is in it, to Act regularly. There∣fore,
of how great Concern is the
knowledg of Medicines strengthening,
exhilarating, and pacifying Nature;
since she is the only Actor, as well as
Curer of her self? How chary then
ought a <HI>Physician</HI> to be of what he
gives to his <HI>Patients,</HI> that he may not
compel Nature by the Crudeness, Con∣trariety,
or Poysonous Property of
Medicines (which qualities all direct
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
Purgers and Vomiters have) to ex∣haust
her strength, by opposing one
Evil with another?</P>
<P>If Physicians have not Remedies
more general, pure and friendly, than
those that are usually given (I mean
such, as can excite Nature to Action,
give her strength, be imployed by
her to this or that Operation, with∣out
leaving Reliques Offensive, nay
sometimes more troublesome, than the
Disease it self) the want of such can
be no excuse to them: For GOD hath
not left Mortals deprived of Reme∣dies,
of a more friendly and benign
Nature and Condition, did not Pride,
Covetousness and an overweaning
Conceit, accompanied with Negli∣gence,
attend some <HI>Book-Doctors,</HI>
keeping them from searching into the
Mystery of true Practice. These Men
conclude, if they administer accord∣ing
to a written Rule, set out by any
they esteem able (let the success be
what it will) 'tis justifiable, because
answearable to what was directed;
they themselves being Judges; thô it
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
be contrary to Nature in all Respects.
But, were Nature more minded, and
the Receipts of Doctors less, we should
see an happier effect on diseased Per∣sons.
And were the errors they com∣mit,
writ on their Foreheads; or the
means, by which they have attained
their Grandeur among the People,
duly examined; they would be asha∣med
of the one, and abhor the o∣ther.</P>
<P><HI>Nature</HI> is that we ought to observe,
to strengthen her where she is weak,
to enlighten her where dark, to pacify
her when inraged; that <HI>Fear</HI> may
vanish, <HI>Rage</HI> may cease, and <HI>Amaze∣ment</HI>
be expelled. Whosoever can ac∣complish
this, shall find the most stub∣born,
and accounted uncurable Dis∣eases,
to fly before him. But, Dili∣gence,
a sound and unbyassed Under∣standing,
accompanied with Patience,
Love and Zeal, are Essential to open
these Deeps, and to discover such Me∣dicines,
as are fit to extirpate those Ex∣orbitances.
Alas! those that have
trod this Path, have been very few
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
(or they have concealed themselves)
and what they have written rather
stirs up desire, than satisfies. The
Famous Medicines of <HI>Paracelsus</HI> and
<HI>Helmont,</HI> notwithstanding their Volu∣minous
Writings, and frequent Cita∣tions
of them, contribute little to us,
only, that they incite us to follow
Nature: but the Remedies themselves,
either dyed with them, or are very
secret: No general Rule is extant,
whereby such Medicines may be ob∣tained.
What shall we do? Where
shall we seek? unless we can find the
Path of Nature is general, we shall
not be able by Art to answer her de∣ficiency
in particular. The Pious and
Learned <HI>Silurist,</HI> in his <HI>Silex Scintil∣lans,</HI>
hath something fitted to this
purpose, where he saith:
<Q><L>When Nature on her Bosome saw</L>
<L>Her Children dye,</L>
<L>And all her Fruits withred to Straw,</L>
<L>Her Breasts grown dry;</L>
<L>She made the Earth (her Nurse and Tomb)
Sigh to the Sky:</L>
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>
<L>Till to those sighs, fetcht from her Womb,</L>
<L>Rain did reply.</L>
<L>So, in the midst of all her Fears</L>
<L>And faint Requests,</L>
<L>Her earnest Sighs procur'd those Tears,</L>
<L>That fill'd her Breasts.</L></Q></P>
<P>What is most natural is most fit to
be exemplary, and will seldom fail
those that follow it. But, to rake the
Volumes of the Dead (when their
Sense is buryed with them) to find
Understanding, is as irrational as for
the Blind to endeavour to discern Co∣lours.
Besides, it is a great underva∣luing
of Mans own Capacity, <HI>Natures</HI>
Bounty, and <HI>God's</HI> Blessing, to judg
what hath been once done may not
be done again. For, altho their Medi∣cines
be dead with them, or obscu∣red;
yet Nature is still in being, and
her <HI>Lord</HI> (the Dispenser of every
Virtue) lives for evermore, loves his
Creatures, created Medicines for
them, and never faileth to impar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Gifts to the Sons of Men, according
as they stand capacitated to receive
them. But, if we think the old Metho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="43" REF="29"/>
of the <HI>Ancients</HI> (set the natural Part
thereof aside, which is the least Particle
thereof) which is already known, and
found to be uncertain, to be sufficient
for <HI>Diseases</HI> which were not then in
being, it is as much as to fit one Hat
to every Head, and one Shoo to every
Foot.</P>
<P>Let it be inquired how <HI>Remedies</HI>
came first to be known, seing we
know Man is born into the World,
with the least Capacity to help him∣self;
and then Knowledg must either
arise by instinct, or by being acquired
by <HI>Experience;</HI> or be attained to by
Education, or by Something beyond
all. Assuredly, Education cannot right∣fully
assume to it self the principal
<HI>Place;</HI> for it is most certain, that that
Knowledg which is real, must either
be taught from Natural Instinct, or be
acquired from Observation. And if
from either of these, whensoever new
Diseases happen, must not the Cures
of the same naturally arise from one
of them two? because there is no
<HI>Rule,</HI> nor can be any for what was
<PB N="44" REF="30"/>
not in being before. If no <HI>Rule,</HI> then
certainly natural <HI>Instinct,</HI> or <HI>Expe∣rience</HI>
acquired by Observation, must
be the only available and truly preva∣lent
<HI>Medium,</HI> by which the most cer∣tain
and proper <HI>Remedies</HI> of such new
Evils can be known. Education in
these Cases cannot help; For, 'tis ap∣parently
manifest, that all Education
ariseth from certain received <HI>Prin∣ciples,</HI>
of supposed Conveniency or
Inconveniency: and as the <HI>Principles</HI>
are, true or false, particular or gene∣ral,
so do they enlarge or diminish
the Understanding. What takes be∣ing
from <HI>Experience</HI> is true (if they,
who possess the same, have a true sen∣timent
of the experiment, and well
understood the <HI>Causes)</HI> being sensible;
yet, as it hath being from <HI>Effects,</HI> it is
not always presidential for the future:
But, what ariseth naturally, and hath
the inborn <HI>Principles</HI> in Man for its
Guide, is the true <HI>Patron</HI> of all Gene∣ral
and Particular Knowledg; I call
to witness the Testimony of all <HI>Ages,</HI>
and ask:</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="30"/>
Who instructed the first <HI>Authors</HI> of
<HI>Physick,</HI> when there were neither
<HI>Books,</HI> nor <HI>Precedents?</HI> Who taught
<HI>Hippocrates</HI> so many <HI>Ages</HI> since, to
distinguish something <HI>Divine</HI> in cer∣tain
Diseases, and to have a Cure for
a popular <HI>Plague,</HI> never known or
heard of before? Whence was it,
that the same Man (in that Age of
the World, wherein Diseases and their
Remedies were neither known nor
distinguished in any measure) did ob∣tain
a most clear Light, not only to
distinguish, but also to cure <HI>Diseases</HI>
with proper <HI>Medicines?</HI> How was
<HI>Basilius</HI> a <HI>Monk</HI> instructed, who in his
days became a most knowing <HI>Physi∣cian?</HI>
Did not <HI>Paracelsus</HI> and <HI>Hel∣mont,</HI>
neglecting the Traditions of
their Predecessors, obtain Medicines
of greater Efficacy, than all that went
before them? <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> thô bred
up in Schools, chosen <HI>Professor</HI> of <HI>Phy∣sick</HI>
in <HI>Basil,</HI> raised not his Knowledg
from what he had read, but from the
<HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> operating in him; as
sufficiently appears by his dissenting
<PB N="46" REF="31"/>
from every known Rule; and by his
effectual Cures; as also, by his own
declaration, That he had not read any
Book of <HI>Philosophy</HI> or <HI>Physick</HI> in Ten
Years time together. And <HI>Helmont</HI>
acknowledged, That he found out
more certainty, when Discourse and
Phansy, or Imagination was subdued,
than by all his Readings or Concep∣tions:
To the Truth of which, some
now in being can bear their testimony.
And is it not daily manifest, that the
<HI>Indians,</HI> which have no Books, by Na∣tural
Instinct only find out the Vir∣tues
of <HI>Plants,</HI> so that they rarely
want a Medicine for their Common
Distempers? Do we not our selves
often see Sick Persons (given over by
<HI>Physicians)</HI> to be cured by their own
natural Impulse? One Person is cu∣red
after one sort, Another after an∣other,
altogetehr contrary to a known
Method; which we ignorantly call
<HI>Chance,</HI> but it is so only to Us: For,
without doubt, this is <HI>Nature,</HI> that
naturally excites Man to his Cure;
as the <HI>Dog,</HI> to <HI>Quitchgrass;</HI> the <HI>Cat,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>
to <HI>Nep;</HI> the <HI>Swallow,</HI> to <HI>Celandine,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>If <HI>Nature</HI> be (as indeed she is) the
Exciter of these Animals, to their pro∣per
<HI>Remedies,</HI> without any Concep∣tion,
Fore-thought, or Reasoning of
their own; how much more is she
of Man, in whom is latent a Capacity
of knowing things in their Roots, so,
that some Men, void of much discourse
or Reasoning, when the internal Man
in them is touched or excited, utter
wonderful things; yet, are uncapable
of Reasoning how, or why they utter
them? Even so, Arts appear more
polite, where Nature bringeth them
forth in Man, without the Consult of
his Reason. For as the Strength of the
Lion, and Fierceness of the Tiger, the
Courage of an Horse in time of Bat∣tel,
and the Fearfulness of the Hare,
are not the Consults of their Strengths
or Weaknesses, or the Effect of Edu∣cation,
but ingenited Properties; so
we see some apted to <HI>Musick,</HI> to <HI>Poe∣try,</HI>
to <HI>Limning,</HI> to <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> the
<HI>Mathematick Science,</HI> and <HI>Mechanick
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>
Arts,</HI> in so high a measure, that they
evidently outstrip all others that have
been educated therein. Who did ever
exceed <HI>Appelles?</HI> When did ever Art
make a Poet come near <HI>Homer,</HI> for
exactness of Phansy? Nay, 'tis gene∣rally
taken for granted, that Poets
are born, not made. Our own days
produced a Child, capable of solving
most solvable Questions in <HI>Arithme∣tick,</HI>
without a <HI>Teacher,</HI> or known
<HI>Rule.</HI> The Merchants, that Trade
to the Gold-Coasts, have told me, that
the <HI>Negroes,</HI> upon their Fingers, soon∣er
account the value of Commodi∣ties,
thô in broken Numbers, than our
acutest Merchants can with their
Pen. How many have we seen ex∣cellent
Artists in Mechanick Works,
that never learned them of Masters
by Education skilled therein? But
to conclude all, of whom did <HI>Archi∣medes</HI>
learn his admirable (and as yet
unparallell'd) Inventions of Mecha∣nick
Engins, by which he so long
withstood the Roman Army, both by
Sea and Land; using his single Arti∣fice
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>
only, without the help of other
Weapons? insomuch, that <HI>Marcellus,</HI>
General of that Army, speaking in
Mockery to the <HI>Engineers</HI> of his own
Camp (as <HI>Plutarch</HI> writeth) said:
<HI>What? shall we never cease to make
War with this</HI> Briarean <HI>Engineer, and
Geometrician here? who, sitting still
at his Ease, in sporting manner, hath
with shame overthrown our Navy, and
exceeded all the fabulous hundred
Hands of the Giants, discharging at
one instant so many Shot amongst us?</HI>
Whence, I say, had these Men their
Instruction, while we, who have had
their Books and Experiments (or at
least an indubitate Relation of them)
yet attain not to their Perfection, thô
so many hundred Years be past, and
so many <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Heads</HI> have been
imployed since their time? Surely
Nothing hath been a greater Cause of
this deficiency in Us, than our sup∣posing
Things declared to be a better
Rule to be gone by, than the <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI>
they began upon, who declared
them. And were it not for that, I
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>
cannot but, think, that we had been
long ago so enlarged in our Under∣standings,
as these Lines need not
have been written at this time. But
then, I would also be understood to
suppose, that the Foundation, in and
by which these famous Men attained
to the Perfection of their Arts, be not
neglected by Us: For they, not re∣garding
(perhaps not having, or not
using) the frail and uncertain help of
Books, not trusting to the written
Experiments of others, suffered them∣selves
in great Simplicity (as the Child
above mentioned) to be taught by
<HI>Nature.</HI> This way they obtained a
more certain knowledg, than wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
possible to be attained by any other
way.</P>
<P>Wherefore, to be unlearned in the
Art of <HI>Physick,</HI> is not to want the
benefit of <HI>Languages;</HI> for a due Ob∣servation
of, and living up to the
Rules of <HI>Nature</HI> in that Case provided,
are the chief Things necessary to
that Science, which is more easily at∣tain'd
by a sound Judgment, than by
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>
reading the most Book-Learned Wits.
For, since <HI>Nature</HI> is the Guide of the
Universe, and of each thing therein,
it is not to be doubted, but that as
she brings forth Medicine, so she doth
the Physician also to administer the
same, whether it be considered gene∣rally
or particularly, as to those <HI>Re∣medies,</HI>
the Gifts of which (in all
Ages, Times and Seasons, to all Per∣sons
and all Diseases) are alwayes the
same: or to such Remedies as are
more specifick, or particular, which
are produced by her in one place
only, at one time, and for some Per∣sons;
as Medicines fit for fome certain
personal, or local <HI>Diseases;</HI> and in
another Place and Time, for other
Persons and Diseases.</P>
<P>And it is clearly manifest, that the
knowledg of the Virtues of <HI>Roots,
Herbs</HI> or <HI>Plants,</HI> hath been nothing
advanced since the Days of <HI>Theophra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus</HI>
(a Man naturally experienced
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herein, and the Divulger thereof)
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcept what hath been discovered by
Observation from <HI>Beasts, Birds, Old
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>
Women, Clowns, Indians,</HI> or some such
way unexpectedly. Not, that <HI>Nature</HI>
hath been all this time ignorant, or
uncapable of succouring her own Off-spring,
especially since Diseases have
multiplyed; but those that pretend
themselves <HI>Physicians,</HI> have not been
gifted by her, but have opposed and
hindred her proper Endeavours; they,
being bent and resolved to be wiser
than she, and to compel her by <HI>Re∣medies:</HI>
a Practice their Fore-fathers
never knew: thinking that Man, who
was made in the Image of GOD, hath
no Light or Guide in himself, sufficient
to direct Him to his own help, or the
help of his Neighbour.</P>
<P>O great Blindness! What Man?
the Summary of all created things,
that hath an immortal Soul, shall not
that in him, which descended from
above, be capable to distinguish what
is fit for his help? Shall <HI>Birds</HI> and
<HI>Beasts</HI> have the priviledge to know
the fitness of <HI>Remedies,</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> be
judged uncapable thereof? Shall
barbarous <HI>Indians,</HI> and rude <HI>Shepherds
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>
Husbandmen</HI> or <HI>Old Women</HI> do grea∣ter
Cures, than the Learned Doctors
of our Age? O Shame! For, to be
ignorant of what illiterate Persons
know, is a great reproach to the
Learned; if they, pretending great
knowledg perform little, (even in the
Faculty, of which they call themselves
Masters) and the other, pretending
little, are able to do much more than
they. But, this is, because the One
is excited by natural <HI>Instinct,</HI> and the
Other only by credulous reading.</P>
<P>Althô, at present, these things may
sound harsh to the Ears of some, yet
being true, and having <HI>Nature</HI> for
their Foundation, they will, perhaps,
out-live the Enemies of the same;
and (in this latter <HI>Age)</HI> be as gene∣rally
received as heretofore (in times
of Apostacy) they have been de∣nyed.</P>
<P>Our Ancestors in Art (though vul∣garly
reverenc'd under the notion of
Antiquity) were really but the Infan∣cy
of the World; 'tis our Age which,
by following long after theirs, is in∣deed
<PB N="54" REF="35"/>
the true Antiquity: Why then
should we dote wholly upon their
Childhood-inventions; and not ra∣ther,
having the advantage of Ex∣ample

grow old in Understanding, as well
as in Time? a Pigmey set upon a

failing in her own endeavour, admit
<HI>Retents</HI> of things to her further Di∣sturbance;
which yet may easily be
prevented, by the help of <HI>Remedies</HI>
specifick to the Parts. But, if to the
weakness of a Part, a material Evil be
added, then indeed the Persons (if
not quickly cleared of that Disease)
through the weakness of their inward
Parts, do either soon die, or live a mi∣serable
Life. Nevertheless, even in
the conveyance of such Morbifick
<HI>Idea's,</HI> if the Parts be sound, and no
<PB N="57" REF="36"/>
accidental thing happen to give vi∣gour
thereunto, they perceive no∣thing
thereof for a long time, as is
observable in the <HI>Derivative Gout,</HI>
which a Child (thô begotten by Pa∣rents
strongly possessed therewith)
feeleth many times nothing▪ thereof,
till 40, or 50 years of Age: For, it is
absolutely necessary and essential to
every <HI>Ideal Disease,</HI> (except <HI>Mental
Evils)</HI> to have material filths for the
<HI>Idea</HI> to work upon. For instance I
have observed, that those, who have
contracted the poyson of the <HI>Lues</HI>
mummially, and have otherwise been
of sound Parts, have had no tokens,
nor appearance thereof in several
Years themselves, (and perhaps never
may) yet some of the Children pro∣ceeding
from the same Bodies, have
been naturally infected therewith.
And likewise I have known other Pa∣rents
<HI>Ideally</HI> defiled, to have had <HI>Issues</HI>
that appeared sound and free (because
<HI>Seeds</HI> admit not of ought but <HI>Idea's)</HI>
for 7, 10, or 12 Years; and afterwards
that <HI>Ideal Disease,</HI> by occasional Mat∣ter,
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>
hath manifested it self apparent∣ly
as an hereditary Communication.
Besides, it is observed generally, that
those who are contaminated with that
Disease, by a seminal Contact, have
never any Sense thereof for several
Months; and Others, on whom the
Disease (so acquired) breaks out at
any time, are conscious of some dis∣orderly
Acts, that have introduced
Superfluities, for captivating the Spi∣rits;
without which that Malady,
when seminally induced, is not made
manifest. But, if the <HI>Lues</HI> be mate∣rially
contracted, then the soundest
Body, and the clearest Spirit, escape
not free from the sense thereof for ma∣ny
hours, or at the most not for above
3 days: because it materially affects
the <HI>Parts,</HI> discovers its proper <HI>Signs,</HI>
and manifesteth it self to be material;
and the <HI>Archeus,</HI> striving against it,
produceth Sores and Fluxes in the
Parts infected, thereby to center the
Evil in the Part, to prevent its further
progress in the Body: by which means,
<HI>Gororrhea's</HI> newly gotten are quick∣ly
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
healed, all the internal Parts being
sound; nor do they ever arise to the
<HI>Lues,</HI> except Means be wanting to
keep them from further spreading.
For, Material Diseases, (thô very ve∣nomous,
by reason of their corporeity)
are easier overcome, than the spiritual
or <HI>Ideal;</HI> because they aseend not to
so great an height, as to captivate
<HI>Nature,</HI> so as to make her nourish the
Evil without resistance, except great
Errors are committed: whereas the
<HI>Ideal</HI> do at first darken the Spirits,
and then make them subservient
(through insensibleness of the unma∣teriated
Venom) to prepare Matter
for the existence and nourishment of
that spiritual Evil, and then is the
Disease formed.</P>
<P>Now, for corporeal Evils that are
derived from Parents, having their
original from maternal Nourishments,
they manifest their cruelty so soon as
the Child is born, by one Sign or
other evident to the <HI>Sense,</HI> as by <HI>Vo∣mitings,
Loosness, Restlessness, Thrush,</HI>
or <HI>Convulsions;</HI> sometimes by <HI>Acri∣monies</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>
external or otherwise, by which
their Lives are quickly cut off, if they
be not helped with Remedies that
can fortify the natural powers to re∣sist
those Evils. And that general
Opinion (grounded upon the defe∣ctiveness
of common <HI>Remedies)</HI> that
<HI>Physick</HI> is not fit for <HI>Children,</HI> hath in
all probability cast away many, that
might have been preserved: for ma∣terial
Evils, how great soever they
seem, are seldom mortal, if the inter∣nal
Powers are strengthened by na∣tural
<HI>Medicines;</HI> because the Spirit in
them is not so vitiated, as to nourish
the Evil: thô indeed a diseasy. <HI>Idea,</HI>
imprinted upon the <HI>Archeus</HI> of a
Child, striveth to bring the <HI>Disease</HI>
into act, upon the advantage of every
occasional disorder.</P>
<P><HI>Preternatural Diseases</HI> (so called,
because they have no Root naturally
from Parents, or from diseasy <HI>Seeds;</HI>
but are accidentally begot by variety
of Distempers, as the Spirit or Part is
more or less vitiated) are such as arise
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>
through the Errors of <HI>Digestion;</HI> by
<HI>Fulness, Emptiness, Colds, Heats, Sor∣row,
Anger, Fear, Hatred,</HI> &amp;c. things
transmuted, transmitted or retained;
or when one Disease is changed into
another through misapplication of
Physick, or the irregularity of the
Patient. Under <HI>Fulness,</HI> is compre∣hended
<HI>Gluttony, Drunkenness,</HI> or any
Excess beyond the ability of <HI>Nature</HI>
to digest: for the disagreements like∣wise
of Foods (which, thô taken in
small Quantities, may notwithstand∣ing
offend) are to be numbred among
<HI>Excesses;</HI> because, by reason of their
Properties disagreeing with Constitu∣tions,
through want of use; their dif∣ficulty
to be digested in their being
over solid, their tendency to corrup∣tion,
their fermental Dispositions, or
their hostile Venomes to particular
<HI>Natures</HI> (by their Antipathy there∣unto)
may prove equally burthen∣some,
as the over-charging of the
<HI>Stomach</HI> with agreeable <HI>Meats</HI> and
<HI>Drinks: Either</HI> of these are the Foun∣dations
of <HI>Surfets,</HI> which beget Lan∣guishings
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>
in the Body, <HI>Vomitings,
Headaches,</HI> and <HI>Loosnesses,</HI> through
disability of the <HI>Pylorus;</HI> and if not
conquer'd or healed in their primitive
Root and Seat, then the <HI>Jaundies</HI>
(black or yellow) <HI>Iliac</HI> or <HI>Cholic Pas∣sion,
Diarrhoea; Quotidian</HI> and <HI>Tertian
Feavers, Dysentery, Lientery, Impost∣humes,</HI>
and <HI>Obstructions</HI> in the <HI>Spleen,
Mesentery,</HI> and <HI>Reins,</HI> have their exi∣stences:
whence <HI>Dropsies, Consumpti∣ons,
Hysterical Passions, Cachexies,
Falsies, Vertigoes, Apoplexies,</HI> and
<HI>Epilepsies,</HI> have their original. For,
when Evils are not subdued in the
<HI>Stomach,</HI> but vitiously slide into other
<HI>Bowels,</HI> to defile and beget strange
<HI>Ferments</HI> in them; then the <HI>Spleen</HI>
and <HI>Stomach</HI> conspire to the mainte∣nance
thereof; their own Government
being characterically blemished with
the foregoing disorders. <HI>Emptiness,</HI>
if too much, makes a depression of
the <HI>Spirits,</HI> languishing of the Vi∣tal
Powers, and an indisposition
of the Parts of assimilate Nourish∣ment.
The only <HI>Remedies</HI> of this,
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>
are Foods of a nourishing and more
spiritual Operation. <HI>Colds</HI> and <HI>Heats,</HI>
in too great a Degree, congeal or re∣solve
the natural <HI>Spirits</HI> to an ex∣tream,
and obstruct, or expend the
same.</P>
<P><HI>Contranatural Diseases</HI> are all <HI>Epi∣demics,
Endemics;</HI> and every Poyson,
yea, all such Maladies as derive not
their original from the <HI>Parent's Seed;</HI>
nor take beginning from preterna∣tural
Excesses in Meats and Drinks,
Errors in Digestion, or the like; but
immediately from without assault the
life. Of this kind are the <HI>Pestilence,</HI>
and all annual (commonly <HI>Autumnal)
Distempers,</HI> by us called <HI>New Diseases,</HI>
which arise from the putridness of the
external <HI>Air,</HI> by which our internal <HI>Air</HI>
or <HI>Aether,</HI> being primarily defiled, sud∣denly
contaminates the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI>
so as to beget <HI>Diseases</HI> correspondent to
the <HI>Calamity</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> is oppressed
with, under the predominating <HI>Powers</HI>
of <HI>Stupor, Rage,</HI> or <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Stupor,</HI> the <HI>Disease</HI> having ener∣vated
the Efficacy of the <HI>Spirits</HI> dis∣crimination,
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>
finisheth the <HI>Tragedy</HI>
without resistance: and when 'tis
finished, <HI>Nature</HI> her self gives testi∣mony
of her own Vanquishment, by
that small refuscitation of her proper
<HI>Powers,</HI> which plainly shews her In∣capacity
to strive against the prevail∣ing
<HI>Evil;</HI> because, while sensible of
the Assault, she willingly yields to
<HI>Death,</HI> without <HI>Strife:</HI> as was suffi∣ciently
manifest to me in those, that
(in the Year 1665,) had the <HI>Plague;</HI>
in whom, <HI>Nature,</HI> so soon as she was
sensible of her own Inability of over∣coming,
voluntarily submitted to the
prevailing Evil. And, thô <HI>Sense</HI> was
perfect, yet, when the <HI>Tokens</HI> appear∣ed,
each <HI>Person</HI> so concerned, thô
seemingly well <HI>(Weakness</HI> excepted)
as at any other usual time, seldom
fayled of dying in 12, or 24 hours▪
Under this manifestation of the pre∣vailing
<HI>Disease,</HI> the <HI>Pulses</HI> are equal▪
thô slow, the <HI>Vrine</HI> thin, and nothing
visibly different from an healthful
<HI>State:</HI> nevertheless in <HI>these,</HI> there are

<PB N="65" REF="40"/>
to <HI>Convulsions,</HI> which (except <HI>Re∣medies</HI>

as to be capable and able to
enliven the <HI>Spirit</HI> to act against the
<HI>Disease,</HI> and resist its <HI>Venome)</HI> always
end in <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Rage, Nature</HI> being sensible of
the Evil, acts violently against it,
moves in and by the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI>
stirs up <HI>Vomitings, Headaches, Phren∣sies,</HI>
and <HI>Vehement Burnings, Blanes,
Buboes, Carbuncles, Pustles,</HI> &amp;c. fer∣ments
the Bloud sometimes to eva∣cuation
by the <HI>Nostrils, Bowels</HI> and
<HI>Vrine.</HI> But, if <HI>Remedies</HI> be used, that
can resist the <HI>Venome</HI> and appease the
<HI>Rage, Sweats</HI> following, all those in∣ordinate
Acts cease; <HI>Blanes, Car∣buncles,</HI>
and <HI>Pustles</HI> ripen; <HI>Buboes</HI> dis∣solve,
and the <HI>Disease</HI> is by little and
little overcome.</P>
<P><HI>Fear</HI> betrayes the Succours of <HI>Na∣ture,</HI>
and renders all endeavours use∣less;
because (through that) she rea∣dily
receives the <HI>Venome,</HI> sinks under

it, and rather endeavours to nourish,
than strives against the <HI>Enemy.</HI> The
<HI>Signs</HI> of which are <HI>Faintings, Languish∣ings</HI>
of the <HI>Spirits, Palpitations</HI> of the
<HI>Heart, Tremblings</HI> of the <HI>Pulse,</HI> and
rarely ever any other <HI>Testimony</HI> of the
<HI>Disease,</HI> than the <HI>Tokens:</HI> and if such
Persons have (as sometimes happens)
<HI>Blanes, Pustles, Carbuncles,</HI> or <HI>Buboes,</HI>
they neither ripen, nor dissolve. In
this Case (thô so desperate) if high
<HI>Cordials</HI> be at first administred and
continued, with those <HI>Medicines,</HI> that
resist malignity, then sometimes the
<HI>Sick</HI> are happily cured, otherwise they

<P>NOw, I proceed to a direct Ex∣planation
of my <HI>Practice</HI> in <HI>Cure</HI>
of <HI>Diseases,</HI> consonant to the <HI>Theory</HI>
above given. But, because I have
elsewhere spoken of <HI>Cures,</HI> by me
performed in the same Method, from
the Year, 1657, to the Year 1665;
I will discourse only of those Distem∣pers,
that since that Time (thô of the
Progress and Determination of the
<HI>Plague</HI> alone then raging, I could write
a large Volume) have fallen under my
Care, and been Cured without the
<PB N="71" REF="43"/>
help of any of the Compositions of
the Shops, or commonly known <HI>Chy∣mical
Remedies;</HI> both which kinds of
Medicines, I do, in a manner, tacitly
disclaim, as unfit to serve the extream
Necessities of <HI>Nature;</HI> yet, have I so
far allowed of them, as they may in
some sort or degree be of use in Cases
less difficult: well knowing, that 'tis
only the Prudence of <HI>Physicians,</HI> in a
due application of <HI>Remedies</HI> specifick
to Parts or Juyces, which renders
them serviceable to the End, for which
they were made. Nevertheless, for
brevity sake, and because in my <HI>Theory</HI>
to this present <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Physick,</HI> I
have at large discoursed about this
matter, I shall say no more of them;
but go on, by the <HI>Practice</HI> it self, to
prove the Use of <HI>General Medicines</HI>
to be rational, and true, certain in
<HI>Nature,</HI> and confirmed by <HI>Experi∣ence.</HI></P>
<P>In order to which, I begin with
the <HI>Plague</HI> in the Year 1665, and the
<HI>Diseases</HI> of the following Years;
wherein popular <HI>Distempers</HI> (the Re∣licts
<PB N="72" REF="44"/>
of the preceding <HI>Plague)</HI> did suf∣ficiently
manifest themselves in their
Vigour, and reigned long, to the Asto∣nishment
of those <HI>Doctors,</HI> who (the
Year before) conscious to themselves
of the Deficiency of their own Medi∣cines,
fit to resist that Malignity, for∣sook
their <HI>Patients</HI> in a time, when
their Skill (had it been worth Esteem)
would have been of greatest Ser∣vice.</P>
<P>Having affirmed, <HI>Diseases</HI> to be ei∣ther
Simple, or Complicated, Resolved
or Congealed, as I must (with <HI>Para∣celsus)</HI>
acknowledg all Diseases are, it
is now time to speak of their <HI>Cures;</HI>
first <HI>particularly,</HI> and afterwards, <HI>gene∣rally.</HI></P>
<P>In order to which, for order sake, I
intend to give a short hint of <HI>Cures,</HI>
both particular and general (in dis∣coursing
of which, I shall be exceed∣ing
brief) afterward, by many Ex∣amples
produced from my own Expe∣rience,
of more than Eighteen Years
since the last <HI>Plague,</HI> confirm the
Truth of this my <HI>Theory,</HI> by my

proper <HI>Practice</HI> in a larger man∣ner.</P>
<P>Therefore first, I thus say: <HI>In Con∣gealed
Distempers, Remedies</HI> further∣ing
<HI>Transpiration,</HI> by resolving those
acrid Powers, that hinder the same,
are most conducent to the Cure of
them. But, in <HI>Resolution</HI> of the <HI>Pow∣ers,</HI>
where <HI>Faintings,</HI> and <HI>Palpitations</HI>
are predominant; there <HI>Constringents</HI>
are most serviceable.</P>
<P>Yet open <HI>Tinctures,</HI> by which <HI>Na∣ture</HI>
may (as in a Glass) see her own
<HI>Deficiency,</HI> perform both the one and
the other, more strongly or more re∣missly,
according to the <HI>Excellency</HI> of
them.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="condition">
<HEAD>Of the Plague.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the said <HI>Plague,</HI>
I used all the known Anti-pesti∣lential
Medicines (both of An∣cient
and Modern Physicians) which I
<PB N="74" REF="45"/>
found would indeed provoke <HI>Sweats;</HI>
yet not naturally, but by help of
Cloaths, where a great Burning gene∣rally
was, before the <HI>Sweats</HI> appeared.
By reason whereof, <HI>Nature,</HI> (being
wearied) through such a forcible way
of acting, could not be supported suf∣ficiently
to the extirpation of that <HI>Ve∣nome,</HI>
so as to dissolve <HI>Buboes,</HI> with∣out
maturation; nor ripen <HI>Blanes,</HI> or
<HI>Carbuncles,</HI> but by a long Series of
Time, and great Conflicts of the Sick,
which too frequently ended in Death;
thô, the <HI>Plague</HI> (at that time) was
not come to the height of its Malig∣nity.
Perceiving this, I had recourse
to my own <HI>Medicines,</HI> which I had
formerly found successful in most <HI>Fea∣vers:</HI>
For, by these <HI>Remedies,</HI> such as
came to me upon the first Assault, if
the <HI>Chyle</HI> was infected, and any Ful∣ness
remained in the Stomach, they
usually Vomited at first, and present∣ly
after fell into <HI>Sweats,</HI> without pre∣ceding
<HI>Burnings,</HI> or the help of <HI>Cloaths.</HI>
And the Sweats, for the first 12, or
24 Hours, were like drops of Water
<PB N="75" REF="45"/>
from a Bucket, for largeness; yet was
there not any Depression of Spirit, but
more ease, and greater vitality or
liveliness, and the Continuation of the
same <HI>Sweats</HI> was pleasant and refresh∣ing:
by which Means, <HI>Buboes</HI> dissol∣ved,
and in the third Day (at farthest)
the Malignity was separated: And,
thô the same <HI>Remedies</HI> were conti∣nued,
yet after that time no <HI>Sweats</HI>
appeared, otherwise, than was usual
in an healthful Person, the Time and
Season being considered. But where
<HI>Blanes</HI> and <HI>Carbuncles</HI> appeared, there
<HI>Sweats</HI> were not so great, nor so con∣tinual;
but usually on the third Day,
the <HI>Blanes</HI> and <HI>Carbuncles</HI> opened, and
their <HI>Eschars</HI> were divided from the
Living <HI>Flesh,</HI> and digestion so followed
into <HI>Matter,</HI> that in a short time (com∣paratively
to that, where other Medi∣cines
were used) perfect Health fol∣lowed.</P>

<PB N="76" REF="46"/>
<HEAD>The different manner of Assaults
at that time.</HEAD>
<P>In the first Assaults of that <HI>Pesti∣lence,</HI>
some were taken with great
shivering Pains in the Back and Head:
others were afflicted with Lightness
of the Head, without pain; but had
Tremblings and Palpitations of the
Heart, and sometimes Swoonings.
Some were assayled, as with a Stroak,
Stab, or Prick; Others with <HI>Blanes,
Buboes,</HI> or <HI>Carbuncles,</HI> without any
manifest Sickness at their first appea∣rance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>My Method of Cure.</HEAD>
<P>Under all these various manifesta∣tions
(except where great fear was)
I always used one and the same Me∣thod.
When they were first taken
ill, I ordered them to go to Bed pre∣sently,
and lay no more Cloaths on,
than they usually did in time of
health; then I gave them my <HI>Pou∣der,</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="46"/>
in a spoonful of Wine, Ale, or Beer:
and I gave my <HI>Aqua Pestilentialis,</HI> if
taken with shiverings, two or three
Spoonfuls; but if hot, then but one
Spoonful, or one Spoonful and half,
perswading them to lye still; which
if they did, <HI>Sweats</HI> presently followed,
and for their supports therein, they
were allowed Mace-Ale, Posset-Drink,
Sack or White-Wine; thin Caudle
with a little Wine in it, and either of
these somewhat often repeated, but in
small Quantities. My <HI>Aqua Pestilen∣tialis</HI>
was taken as often, as need re∣quired;
sometimes once in an hour,
sometimes more, and sometimes less,
as Occasion was. My <HI>Pouder</HI> was
repeated once in two, four, or six
hours, according to the Capacity of
<HI>Nature:</HI> where Diminution of <HI>Sweats</HI>
and of Strength hapned, it was often
taken; but if the Patients continued
sweating, and strong and brisk, only
once in six hours. But, if there seem∣ed
a Tendency to a Loosness, which
(in that Disease) was usually fatal,
<PB N="78" REF="47"/>
my <HI>Coralline Cordial</HI> was often used,
a spoonful at a time every half hour,
until the Signs of <HI>Laxity</HI> disappeared.
Where great Thirst was concomitant
with the <HI>Disease,</HI> I used my <HI>Simplex,</HI>
mixed into the form of a small <HI>Cordial</HI>
Drink, ordering one spoonful at a
time to be taken into the Patient's
Mouth, and swallowed down leisure∣ly,
as it were by Drops. And if great
<HI>Restlesness</HI> hapned, through want of
<HI>Sleep,</HI> I administred ten grains of Salt
of <HI>Hartshorn</HI> purified, and dissolved
in <HI>Cytron</HI>-Water, or White-Wine Pos∣set-Drink,
and repeated the <HI>Dose</HI> once
in two hours, not neglecting the fore∣said
<HI>Pouder.</HI> This <HI>Remedy</HI> thus sea∣sonably
given, seemed to me far more
successful in relieving <HI>Nature</HI> in that
Exigency, than any common Dorma∣tive
<HI>Medicine,</HI> of what kind soever.
But, if presently after the Assault there
appeared a <HI>Stupor,</HI> Drowziness, and a
slow Pulse; then did I make a strong
Cordial of the <HI>Simplex,</HI> and gave of
it a Spoonful at a time, once in an
<PB N="79" REF="47"/>
hour (not neglecting either the said
<HI>Pouder,</HI> or the said <HI>Aqua Pestilentia∣lis)</HI>
till the Pulse was raised, and the
<HI>Sweats</HI> flowed free; and then I pro∣ceeded
in all things, as before speci∣fied.</P>
<P>In great <HI>Fear,</HI> thô I gave the Pou∣der
at first, yet I always used large
Quantities of the <HI>Coralline</HI> Cordial, to
refresh the declining Spirits, and to
procure free <HI>Sweats;</HI> which if attain∣ed,
then the Method before spoken of
was continued to the end of the
<HI>Cure.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Anguish</HI> of <HI>Carbuncles</HI> and
<HI>Blanes,</HI> I applyed outwardly (besides
the internal Medicines) my <HI>Resolving
Cerot,</HI> and changed the same once in
6, or 12 hours, according as the Do∣lours
were more intense, or more re∣miss.
For I had, by sad Experience,
seen the fruitlesness of all Magnetical
Attractives, whether Mineral, Vege∣table
or Animal: nay, the prepared
<HI>Toads,</HI> so famous in the Year, 1603,
(testifyed of by <HI>Helmont,</HI> and before
him highly extolled by <HI>Paracelsus)</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="48"/>
proved here of no use, either to ex∣tract
the <HI>Venome,</HI> or prevent the Ma∣lignity
of that <HI>Disease.</HI></P>
<P>I here write nothing of <HI>Buboes,</HI> be∣cause
(where my Medicines were
used) they never ripened, but dissol∣ved;
except, where <HI>Patients</HI> were
disobedient, and unwilling to conti∣nue
in their <HI>Sweats,</HI> and so gave Oc∣casion
to the maturation thereof:
which (thô but seldom) hapning, I
then applyed only my <HI>Resolving Ce∣rot,</HI>
as before; and found the same,
as well in ripening as in resolving, to
exceed all Poultisses and Plaisters, I
ever used before, or since.</P>

<HEAD>Remarks upon the Carelesness of Pa∣tients
afflicted with the Plague, or
their Attendants, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHen some Persons, using my
Medicines, had layn in <HI>Sweats,</HI>
for 24 hours, more or less, and found
themselves seemingly well, and free
from all Disturbances, or Sense of the
Pestilential Venome, they (notwith∣standing
their Sweats continued large
and free) would needs rise out of Bed,
and so checked those Sweats, inferring
on themselves sudden Death. For, I
always observed, that no One, having
that Disease, who did rise out of Bed
before the third Day; or at least be∣fore
Sweats (excited by the use of my
Medicines) had wholly ceased, did
ever recover; except by that long
and tedious way of Maturation of <HI>Bu∣boes,</HI>
which then admitted not of Dis∣solution;
because after that time,
<HI>Sweats</HI> could never more be naturally
excited.</P>
<P>Also, no less fatal Errours were
<PB N="82" REF="49"/>
committed by <HI>Nurses,</HI> and such as at∣tended
the Sick, in laying on too ma∣ny
Clothes, during the time of their
Sweats: for, so doing, Violence was
offered to <HI>Nature,</HI> and the Spirits,
oppressed thereby, languished under
their own Burthen, and were no lon∣ger
capable of help, by any Means
whatsoever.</P>
<P>Moreover, where People (in time
of the <HI>Pestilence)</HI> to please their Ap∣petites,
eat large Meals, or over-cool∣ing
Foods, as Fresh-Fish, all sorts of
Fruits, Melons, Cowcumbers, &amp;c. thô
in a remiss degree; yet, if the same
Persons were taken with that Disease,
great Vomitings and Loosnesses fol∣lowed,
which did generally end in
Death. Because such Persons could
not (by any <HI>Remedies)</HI> be brought to
Sweat, after the manner of those, that
lived Temperately, and avoided like
<HI>Excesses.</HI> Also, these <HI>Patients</HI> were
wont, for the most part, to impute
their extream Loosnesses and Vomit∣ings,
rather to their own inordinate
<PB N="83" REF="49"/>
Eating, than to the Power of the
<HI>Plague,</HI> then <HI>Raging;</HI> and so, sought
not Remedies against the invading
<HI>Venome,</HI> but used particular Medicines,
according as the present and (by them
thought) only Occasion required.
Whereas, on the Contrary, Those that
lived Temperately, and were watch∣ful
over themselves, so as to take <HI>Re∣medies</HI>
presently after the first Sense
of any Assault of that Venome, and
followed the Order before prescribed,
very rarely miscarried. For, whole
Families, that have been large and in∣fected,
have all escaped, through their
proper Care, and Prudence, in duly
observing the Directions above gi∣ven.</P>
<P>Yet, which is to be lamented, I
have observed, that when <HI>Spots</HI> ap∣peared,
of what kind soever they were,
the <HI>Nurses</HI> and <HI>Tenders</HI> of the <HI>Sick,</HI>
seeing them, were seized with so great
amazement, that they forsook all their
former Care, insomuch as they gave
up their <HI>Patients</HI> for dead; thô those
<HI>Spots</HI> were not the direct <HI>Signs</HI> of
<PB N="84" REF="50"/>
Mortality. For all I have seen, ha∣ving
such <HI>Spots,</HI> (except <HI>One)</HI> did re∣cover.
But that <HI>Spot,</HI> which whoso∣ever
was seiz'd with dyed under it,
had a round Circle, dark blew, and
green, (after the manner of Mixtions
of Colours in the Rain-bow) and in
the Center thereof a Crimson Spot,
that felt hard under the Finger, in
comparison of the Softness of the
other Flesh. This, in that <HI>Plague,</HI> was
the infallible token of sudden <HI>Death:</HI>
Therefore such <HI>Spots</HI> were rightly
called <HI>Tokens.</HI></P>

<P>THis Disease, for some Years (espe∣cially

did sufficiently manifest it self to be a
Relict of that <HI>Popular Distemper:</HI> For
this Malady Exceeded all other acute
<PB N="85" REF="50"/>
Distempers; the Patients, afflicted
therewith usually dying at the third

because the Veins opening, the Bloud
flowed out, like a Torrent, and passing
through the <HI>Guts,</HI> no laudable Excre∣ment
could be seen in the <HI>Stools,</HI> but
Bloud, and a Gelly-like Matter, that
smelt like boyled <HI>Horns.</HI> The <HI>Pains</HI>
were excessive, <HI>Stools</HI> almost conti∣nual,
thô in small Quantities; and
until such time as by the power of
<HI>Nature</HI> alone, or through the help of
proper Medicines, the Bloud was
restrained, the Gelly-like-Matter les∣sened,
and <HI>Excrements</HI> laudable (both

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>My Method of Cure.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the first Assault, or great Gri∣pings,
and appearance of Bloud, or
Gelly-like-Matter in the Excrements,
I gave my <HI>Pouder</HI> (above specifyed
in the <HI>Plague)</HI> once every two hours,
<PB N="86" REF="51"/>
my <HI>Coralline</HI> Cordial once every hour,
and applyed to the <HI>Belly Tripe</HI> par∣boyled,
which was laid on warm;
and when that waxed Cool or Smelt,
other warm parboyled Tripe was ap∣plyed.
By this <HI>Method,</HI> the first Day
the Bloud was restrained, and the
Pain somewhat mitigated: The se∣cond
Day, the Gelly-like-Matter les∣sened,
and some appearance of Excre∣ment
shewed it self: And on the
third Day, laudable Excrements were
seen, and the Gelly-like-Matter dis∣appeared.
Then, by continuing the
same Medicines, in the former Me∣thod,
large Sweats were produced,
which (being continued in but one
Day or two) perfect Health succeed∣ed.
Nor did I ever know any One,
from that time unto this very Day,
perish by ahe Malignity of this Dis∣ease;
if they took my Medicines (and

Beer and Wine I forbid, till the <HI>Disease</HI>
slackned. I permitted Milk and Wa∣ter,

drunk, in small Quantities at

I allowed Posset-Drink, made white,

<HEAD>Remarks upon the Errors of Physicians

<P>In the Cure of this <HI>Disease,</HI> I de∣servedly
rejected all <HI>Common Binders,</HI>
or <HI>Restringents,</HI> too much at that time
used by other Physicians, how speci∣fical
soever they were, or might be

supposed to be; because I discerned,
that <HI>Nature,</HI> being enraged by the
presence of that Corroding <HI>Venome,</HI>
wanted only suitable helps, to restrain
her own Exorbitances. I likewise re∣jected
<HI>Opiats,</HI> because they were un∣certain;
and thô they eased Pains,
they cured not. For, I had well ob∣served,
in this <HI>Disease,</HI> That when∣soever
a forcible Stop was made, either
by <HI>Opiats</HI> or <HI>Restringents,</HI> (if <HI>Nature</HI>
were not, at the same time very strong)
then <HI>Light-headedness</HI> and sudden

having no Power to expel the present

<HEAD>Of the Scurvy.</HEAD>
<P>THis being the general <HI>Disease</HI>
of our Country, seemeth both
<HI>Nurse</HI> and <HI>Tomb</HI> to all other Distem∣pers.
The last <HI>Plague</HI> was buried in
it. For, when that <HI>Pestilence</HI> waxed
more mild, it plainly exhibited Scor∣butick
Symptomes. The <HI>Lues</HI> is, by
it, so masked, that its Original can∣not
be discerned. <HI>Autumnal Distem∣pers</HI>
are hid therein; and every pre∣ternatural
Disease, of what kind so∣ever,
if not radically expelled by suit∣able
<HI>Remedies,</HI> discovers it self under
a <HI>Scorbutick Form.</HI> Yea, <HI>Paternal
Diseases,</HI> thô very various, do never
appear without some Signs of the
<HI>Scurvy</HI> commixed with them. Hence
it comes to pass, that when Particular
<HI>Remedies</HI> are applyed to Particular
<HI>Parts,</HI> or the <HI>Vices</HI> of them, (no <HI>Ge∣neral
Medicine</HI> being in the mean
<PB N="90" REF="53"/>
time used) thô they may cure or re∣move
the particular offences of these
or those Parts, yet it is but as the Cut∣ting
off the <HI>Hydra's</HI> Head, in stead of
which many more appear.</P>
<P>Now, as it is apparent, that all these
<HI>Diseases</HI> are covered by the <HI>Scurvy;</HI>
so it is no less manifest, that the same
Distemper doth both nurse and nou∣rish
them. For the <HI>Lues</HI> becometh
more mild, through the dark cold and
stupifying Nature thereof; so that it
doth not so often occasion great pains
in the Bones between the Joynts, as
were usual (when the <HI>Lues</HI> was sim∣ple,
and not complicated with the
<HI>Scurvy)</HI> but wandereth in the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
disaffecteth the <HI>Brain,</HI> produceth <HI>Gouts</HI>
of a new strain, <HI>Rheumatisms, Convul∣sions,
Palsies, Vertigo's, Lethargies,
Atrophea's, Lamenesses,</HI> &amp;c. In every
of these <HI>Diseases,</HI> thô particular, which
by the <HI>Ancients</HI> (according to what
we read of former <HI>Ages)</HI> were well
known, and often cured; yet, at this
time, if they be remedied, it is rather
<PB N="91" REF="53"/>
casual, than real: because the greatest
part of those <HI>Patients,</HI> that in our
time have been thus afflicted, were
never cured by any <HI>Medicines</HI> of the
<HI>Ancients,</HI> unless in a long Series of
time, where <HI>Nature</HI> her Self was the
Sole and Principal Actor: but, by <HI>Ge∣neral
Remedies,</HI> they usually obtained
a safe and speedy Cure. For, it is clear,
that when the <HI>Lues</HI> is new shaped, by
the modifying power of the <HI>Scurvy,</HI>
that the <HI>Remedies,</HI> usually successful
in expelling and annihilating the <HI>Rage</HI>
of that Disease, proved notoriously
inimical to <HI>Nature;</HI> by reason of the
cruel Qualities of <HI>Mercury,</HI> by the
power of the Venome of the <HI>Lues,</HI>
made corporeal. Which Corporeity,
where the <HI>Lues</HI> is simple, is found to
be of great Use and Service in abating
the Rigour of that <HI>Disease;</HI> but when
Scorbutical it rather increases, than
lessens the same: as I my Self can (by
sad Experience) testify; and <HI>Hart∣mannus</HI>
did many Years ago, in his
own <HI>Practica Chymiatrica,</HI> and in his
Annotations upon <HI>Crollius</HI> his <HI>Basilica
<PB N="92" REF="54"/>
Chymica,</HI> sufficiently manifest the Ini∣miciousness
of <HI>Mercury</HI> to Persons in
any measure afflicted with the <HI>Scur∣vy;</HI>
yet he highly praiseth the Vir∣tue
of Antimony in Scorbutick Di∣stempers;
which plainly shews he
had a true Sense of the different Na∣ture
of such <HI>Diseases</HI> and their <HI>Re∣medies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gouts</HI> of our time very rarely
appear Simple. For in all my <HI>Practice,</HI>
for 30 Years past, I never could dis∣cern
above three Persons, afflicted
with that Disease (which in them was
<HI>Hereditary)</HI> that did exactly answer
to the Descriptions of the <HI>Ancients:</HI>
all the Other have appeared rather
Scorbutical, than otherwise, and been
by me cured after the same <HI>General
Method</HI> above specifyed. But in eve∣ry
true <HI>Gout,</HI> simple and not compli∣cated
(as in this our Day all such Di∣stempers
generally are) the torment∣ing
Pain thereof is only in the <HI>Joynt-Water,</HI>
or <HI>Synovy</HI> between the Joynts;
not elsewhere: whereas these Com∣plicated
<PB N="93" REF="54"/>
or <HI>Scorbutick Gouts</HI> are at∣tended
with Pains in the Muscles,
Nerves, between the Joynts, and in
the <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Back, in the <HI>Os
Sacrum,</HI> and Head; Places never men∣tioned
by the <HI>Ancients</HI> (in all their
Descriptions of that Disease) as lyable
to <HI>Arthritick Dolours,</HI> or more or
less to be affected therewith. There∣fore,</P>
<P>Having thus far given a brief, but
true, Definition of the Nature of the
<HI>Scurvy,</HI> shewing how it intermixeth
it self with other Distempers, disgui∣sing,
changing and nourishing them;
I now proceed to <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Cures</HI>
of the same <HI>Disease,</HI> as it hath mani∣fested
it self to Us, in these our Days,
under several Forms.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>Example 1.</HEAD>
<P>A Man of good repute, having for
some Years laboured under great de∣bility
of <HI>Faculties,</HI> with dejection of
Spirit, and Leanness of Body, inso∣much,
<PB N="94" REF="55"/>
that the Physicians he then
used, concluded an <HI>Atrophea</HI> or <HI>Con∣sumption</HI>
to be present; therefore, as
the best <HI>Remedy</HI> for One in his Con∣dition,
they ordered him to suck his
Wife's Breasts: This Means he used,
and other <HI>Remedies</HI> by them prescri∣bed,
notwithstanding which, a gene∣ral
Lameness followed, with a Palsey,
and great Convulsions, which wrought
so great Confusion in his Physicians,
that (not knowing what to do fur∣ther)
they gave him over for dead or
uncurable. After which, Application
being made to Me, when I had well
weighed his deplorable State, heard
what had been done, and saw the la∣mentable
Effects thereof, I discerned
that the Source of all was the <HI>Scurvy,</HI>
and that nothing could alleviate that
Evil, but Medicines of another Strain.
Therefore, I first of all gave him my
Scorbutic Cordial (the Brain being
deeply affected) with my <HI>Pouder,</HI> re∣peating
that once in six hours, and the
<HI>Cordial</HI> as oft as he pleased. At Night
going to Bed, I gave my <HI>Arcanum
<PB N="95" REF="55"/>
Metallorum,</HI> and my <HI>Scorbutic Tinc∣ture,</HI>
30 Drops at a time, in all his
Drink, Day or Night. This Method
being continued for some few Dayes,
his <HI>Convulsions</HI> ceased, the Weakness
of his Limbs began to abate; and, in∣stead
of great Chilness and Coldness,
that formerly attended, Warmth and
Itchings began to discover themselves,
and (at last) gentle breathing Sweats:
by which Means, his Palsy was taken
off, his lost Speech restored, by little
and little he recovered the Use of his
Limbs, and was at length wholly freed
from his <HI>Disease,</HI> and lived (thô al∣wayes
a weakly Man) Thirteen or
Fourteen Years after.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>Example 2.</HEAD>
<P>An Aged <HI>Gentlewoman,</HI> afflicted
with <HI>Rheumatism-like Pains,</HI> (after an
<HI>Autumnal Feaver)</HI> which Physicians
labouring to remove, by applying
cooling and altering Things, did in∣deed
take off the external <HI>Dolours;</HI> but
<PB N="96" REF="56"/>
(by their <HI>Remedies)</HI> retracted the
Matter causing those Pains inwards
to the Bowels and Mouth of the Sto∣mach;
which great Evil deprived her
totally of the use of her Limbs. Whilst
in this sad and deplorable State, being
utterly given over, as a dying Person,
or at least uncurable, by her Physi∣cians,
I was sent unto. When I came,
and had well considered her Condi∣tion,
and found her Stomach to be so
very weak, as not able to retain a
Glass of Sack, without rejecting the
same suddenly by Vomit; I did not
in this Case (as in Others) give her
my <HI>Pouder</HI> at first, but my <HI>Scorbutic
Cordial</HI> and <HI>Scorbutic Tincture,</HI> as I saw
Cause, and the Exigency of her pre∣sent
State required. When, by these
Means, I discerned her Spirits to be
somewhat enlivened, and her Stomach
fortified in some competent measure,
I then gave my <HI>Pouder</HI> once a Day,
and my <HI>Arcanum Metallorum</HI> at Night.
Having continued this Method for
six or seven Dayes, I found her Water
began to Change, and some Signs of
<PB N="97" REF="56"/>
Separation therein, whereby I judged
her Digestion to be in some measure
recovered. This Course I continued
Day by Day for a long time together;
in which, I discerned that those Pains,
which were before (by their Medi∣cines)
brought into her Belly and
Mouth of her Stomach, were again
retired outward: after which many
<HI>Pustles</HI> came forth, and her Limbs by
little and little gathered Strength;
and, about three quarters of a Year
after, she recovered her pristine State
of Health, and is now alive at this
Day, thô several Years since.</P>

<P>Another <HI>Woman,</HI> thô Young▪ yet

as to go almost double; and
when no <HI>Remedy</HI> could be had for her
from other Physicians, she came to
me. After I understood from her how
it had been with her, I proceeded to
the Cure as follows. I gave her my
<PB N="98" REF="57"/>
<HI>Pouder</HI> every Morning, my <HI>Arcanum
Metallorum,</HI> and <HI>Arcanum Veneris</HI> at
Night; sometimes one, sometimes the
other, as occasion was, and the Exi∣gency
of the <HI>Disease</HI> required; not
omitting to give my <HI>Scorbutic Tincture</HI>
to be taken in all her Drink, during
the whole time of the Cure. Conti∣nuing
this Method, she was recovered
in a short time, and is yet living, thô
several Years since.</P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>Example 4.</HEAD>
<P>A Young <HI>Gentlewoman,</HI> afflicted
with a great <HI>Congelation</HI> in the <HI>Ster∣non,</HI>
always inclining her Head down∣wards
to the Stomach, as if it had
been contracted and forced thither∣wards,
never having the benefit of
<HI>Sneezing,</HI> but long suffering great Pal∣pitations
of the Heart; little or no
Sleep, and such as was, much confu∣sed,
continually under Terrour, and
at the same time with Child; sustain∣ing
this Misery until the time of her
<PB N="99" REF="57"/>
Delivery, and after that finding no
Abatement of the Evil, notwithstand∣ing
the Advice of several Physicians,
and the frequent Use of their <HI>Reme∣dies,</HI>
did at last send to me. I, find∣ing
her in that sad Condition, and un∣derstanding
all the <HI>Remedies</HI> she had
used to be fruitless and unsuccessful,
discerned her Disease to arise from
<HI>Congelation,</HI> under the <HI>Scorbutic Power.</HI>
Therefore, the Fourteenth Day after
her Delivery being come, I first gave
her my <HI>Pouder,</HI> which quickly brought
her to more sedateness, than she had
found in some Months before, and the
small <HI>Sleep,</HI> she then had, proved more
refreshing than formerly, as she her
self acknowledged. This Encouraged
me to proceed, and She (according
to the Result of her own Reason and
Judgment) rationally submitted to the
following Course.</P>
<P>My <HI>Pouder</HI> was given once in 4, or
6 hours; my <HI>Scorbutic Tincture</HI> in all
the Drink she took; my <HI>Arcanum Ve∣neris,</HI>
and <HI>Arcannm Metallorum</HI> every
Night alternately; my <HI>Hysteric Cor∣dial,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="58"/>
and <HI>Hysteric Drops,</HI> upon every
Occasion, or Exigency of <HI>Nature;</HI> not
neglecting other Cordials (by inter∣vals)
for support. This Method, be∣ing
dayly continued, till Strength
came, and she was able to move, did
at last (with a few other <HI>Auxiliaries)</HI>
accomplish the Cure so apparently,
that the external <HI>Cutis</HI> all peeled off,
her whole Mass of Bloud renewed,
and she seemed unto All (that knew
her) to have assumed a new <HI>Comple∣xion,</HI>
and <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note:</HI> That this <HI>Woman</HI> had not
<HI>Sneezed</HI> in 6, or eight Months; but
upon the first Motion thereunto, the
<HI>Congelation</HI> seemed to be much more
easy, and afterwards she sneezed usu∣ally
twice a Day, and by that Means
the Contraction daily lessened, until
it was totally dissolved.</P>
<P><HI>Also,</HI> among the various <HI>Scenes,</HI>
that hapned in this <HI>Disease,</HI> there ne∣ver
was any Purgation by Stools and
Vomits; but the <HI>Distemper</HI> gradually
vanished, by <HI>Transpiration,</HI> small
<HI>Sweats,</HI> and <HI>Vrine,</HI> without any other
<PB N="101" REF="58"/>
sensible Evacuation thereof. And now
she hath attained her full Strength,
and perfect use of her Limbs, with as
great Activity of Spirit, as did ever
attend her before, and hath since con∣ceived
with Child.</P>
<P>It cannot rationally be expected I
should here set down every Accident,
that hapned, and the particular <HI>Auxi∣liaries</HI>
I used, in this and the other
<HI>Scorbutic Diseases</HI> before spoken of:
because, so doing, I should extend this
<HI>Treatise</HI> to too great a Bulk, and ren∣der
it less serviceable (by augmenting
the Price) than otherwise, as by me
intended, it is like to prove. I could
also here subjoyn many more <HI>Examples</HI>

after the former Method; but for the
same Reason I omit them, and pro∣ceed

<HEAD>Of Palseys.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PAlsies</HI> are four-fold, and therefore
have rightly obtain'd four distinct
Denominations, as follows: <HI>Pal∣seys</HI>
of <HI>Contraction, Palsys</HI> of <HI>Resolu∣tion,
Numn-Palsyes,</HI> and <HI>Shaking Pal∣syes;</HI>
which two last are partly resol∣ved,
and partly congealed, therefore
cannot be ranged under either of the
former.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Cure</HI> of these, by four <HI>Ex∣amples</HI>
only, I intend to speak, with as
much brevity, as the Subject Matter
it self can admit.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>Example 1. Of a Contracted Palsy.</HEAD>
<P>A Mayden Child, about Ten years

old, having her Arms and Legs drawn
together, and her Neck drawn of one
Side, (this being certainly known to
every Physician, to be a <HI>Paralytic
Contraction)</HI> I began at first, as I had
done in other Cases, with my <HI>Pouder,</HI>
giving it twice the first Day, and at
Night my <HI>Arcanum Metallorum.</HI> This
Method I continued Day by Day, using
frequently my <HI>Mixtura Simplex,</HI> gi∣ven
five or six times every Day. Some∣times
I gave her my Volatile <HI>Spirit</HI>
(not the fetid acid <HI>Phlegm)</HI> of <HI>Tartar,</HI>
in all her Drink. By which Method,
in three Weeks time, there seemed to
be some Amendment, the <HI>Nerves</HI>
were more relaxed, the Head began
to ake backward, and a Warmth more
than usual in that Part; and this de∣scended
down by the Back-bone. Soon
after this appeared a Drivling in the
Mouth. After the <HI>Pouder</HI> had been
taken for a Month, it began to work
every Day, and wrought a whole
Month after by Vomit and Stool al∣ternately:
yet still, with Increase of
Strength, and Restoration of Facul∣ties.
<PB N="104" REF="60"/>
And, in about ten or twelve
Weeks time, she was perfectly resto∣red
to her pristine State of Health,
and is since married, hath had Chil∣dren,

<P><HI>Note.</HI> In this whole Cure, no other
<HI>Medicines</HI> (than what are above spe∣cified)

<HEAD>Of Convulsions.</HEAD>
<P><HI>COnvulsions</HI> take beginning, either
from an unnatural <HI>Fermentation</HI>
of the <HI>Juyces</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> whereby
every <HI>Vessel</HI> or <HI>Organ</HI> is overmuch di∣sturbed;
or by particular <HI>Compunction</HI>
or <HI>Compression</HI> of the <HI>Nerves</HI> contra∣cted;
or else from <HI>Nature</HI>'s true Sense
of what is fit to be separated from the
Parts offended, and her Endeavour to
separate the same; as is apparent in
the Beginnings of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI>
where the nutritive <HI>Juyces</HI> are con∣densed,
by reason of the <HI>Morbific Fer∣ment,</HI>
and so made unfit for the Nu∣trition
of the Spirits, and the necessa∣ry
Separation appertaining thereunto;
being wholly uncapable to be distri∣buted
to the <HI>Parts.</HI> Here <HI>Nature,</HI>
regularly acting, makes <HI>Convulsions,</HI>
which open the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and render
that <HI>Diseasy Ferment</HI> fit to become
<PB N="108" REF="62"/>
the <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> or <HI>Fea∣vers:</HI>
for, so soon as the <HI>Convulsions</HI>
cease, the <HI>Small Pox</HI> appears; as is
sufficiently evident by the Events:
and it is apparently manifest, that
such <HI>Convulsions</HI> are sooner Perioded,
than the <HI>Ideal.</HI> And althô the <HI>Small
Pox</HI> or <HI>Feavers</HI> be very Malignant;
yet it is rare to see any One fail un∣der
those <HI>Distempers</HI> where <HI>Convul∣sions</HI>
have preceeded: thô a <HI>Convulsion</HI>
happening after those <HI>Diseases,</HI> is
most frequently Mortal. For, the
first is the result of <HI>Nature's</HI> strife a∣gainst
the <HI>Disease;</HI> but the other
(the <HI>Disease</HI> being annihilated, and
Nature overcome) ariseth from the
<HI>Terror</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> of which it is a gene∣ral
<HI>Prodrome.</HI></P>
<P>Also, the <HI>Superfluities,</HI> that <HI>Chil∣dren</HI>
bring with them into the <HI>World,</HI>
are the occasional <HI>Causes</HI> of those ma∣ny
<HI>Convulsions,</HI> that attend them in
their <HI>Infancy.</HI> For, they being <HI>Retents</HI>
of the <HI>Maternal Nourishment,</HI> which
(coming then first under the <HI>Domi∣nion</HI>
of the <HI>Stomach</HI> of the Infant) can∣not
<PB N="109" REF="62"/>
not be received as a <HI>Guest,</HI> but are
rejected, and opposed as an <HI>Enemy</HI> to
<HI>Nutrition;</HI> and if not subdued in the
<HI>Act</HI> of the first <HI>Digestion,</HI> by <HI>Vomit∣ing,</HI>
or <HI>Stools, Red</HI> or <HI>White-Gum,</HI> &amp;c.
they become the Matter of long con∣tinuing
<HI>Convulsions.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise, in Breeding Teeth, <HI>Con∣vulsions</HI>
often happen; For, by the
<HI>Compression</HI> or <HI>Punction</HI> of the Nervous
<HI>Fibres</HI> in the <HI>Gums,</HI> made by the in∣growing
<HI>Teeth, Nature</HI> is enforced
to make <HI>Convulsions,</HI> that the <HI>Teeth</HI>
may break through those <HI>Fibres,</HI> im∣peding
their forth-coming.</P>
<P>But most lamentable are the <HI>Ideal
Convulsions,</HI> which have their Origi∣nal
from <HI>Terror, Frights,</HI> or <HI>Fears:</HI>
For the <HI>Spirit,</HI> by the amazement
they infer, produceth a dark <HI>Image,</HI>
or Impression, by which it is over∣whelmed,
and so driven to irregular
<HI>Actions,</HI> which occasion uncertain
<HI>Events;</HI> because being surprized with
<HI>Stupor,</HI> and not knowing what to do,
it doth nothing to right purpose, by
reason of the variety of <HI>Imaginations</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="63"/>
which (in these Cases) are as va∣rious
as the <HI>Conceptions</HI> of the mind
can be.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Cure of Convulsions, that hap∣pen

<P>In the Cure of these <HI>Convulsions,</HI> I
generally use my <HI>Pouder</HI> once in six
hours, by which the rigour of them
is usually abated; but, if in a short

by the use thereof; then I give my
<HI>Arcanum Metallorum,</HI> or my <HI>Arcanum</HI>

<P><HI>Note:</HI> Here it is to be observed,

<P>These <HI>Convulsions</HI> rarely happen,
where my <HI>Pouder</HI> is given to <HI>Children,</HI>
so soon as they are born, and often
repeated; and if they do afterwards
arise, such <HI>Convulsions</HI> are soon and

there I must confess the <HI>Work</HI>
to be long, and irksome, requiring
Soundness of <HI>Judgment</HI> in the <HI>Physi∣cian,</HI>
because of the great <HI>Variation,</HI>
that happens therein; but more espe∣cially,
by reason of the Dissatisfaction
of <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Nurses,</HI> seeing the
<HI>Fits</HI> more frequent, thô much shor∣ter,
when under my Cure: For, I
once knew a <HI>Child,</HI> so afflicted that

the number not lessening; yet, with

<HI>Fits</HI> were so numerous) that the <HI>Child</HI>
became daily more lively, and each <HI>Fit</HI>
shorter and shorter. After the Tenth

<P><HI>Note:</HI> In <HI>Cure</HI> of this <HI>Child,</HI> I used

too long to be here recited: ne∣vertheless

particular <HI>Auxiliaries.</HI> For, in these

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Lethargies, Coma's, and
Apoplexies.</HEAD>
<P>These <HI>Diseases</HI> have all their Ori∣ginal
from one dark and stupefactive
<HI>Source,</HI> where the Gates of <HI>Sleep</HI> con∣tinually
stand open: for such as are
afflicted with them, are either trou∣bled
with over-much <HI>Drowsiness,</HI> or
oppressed with <HI>Sleeps</HI> too profound.
These Distempers differ only in the
Degrees of their Power: In the two
first, there are only subtile <HI>Vapours,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="65"/>
(by the <HI>Schools</HI> called smoaky) which
having their Assent from the Diseasy
Power of Darkness in Us, do after an
obtuse manner stifle the Natural Fa∣culties;
but in the Latter, <HI>viz. Apo∣plexies,</HI>
they more intensly act, and
materially by <HI>Bloud,</HI> or otherwise sup∣press
the Faculties of Life, and so
absolutely overwhelm all the Powers
of Nature, that the Body (or the Spi∣rit
thereof) becomes wholly Insen∣sible.</P>
<P>I have great Reason to speak of
these Diseases in this manner, having
been much exercised therein. If called
in the beginnings of them, I have
found them to be sooner removed,
than several other Distempers of less
danger: for if the Spirit can be time∣ly
excited, to strive against the Evil,
they quickly vanish. What Medicines
are helpful to One, are really helpful
to All, the <HI>Dose</HI> only considered: but
I never found, in any of these Cases
any other than general <HI>Remedies</HI> to
be profitable, or available in exciting

<HEAD>In Order to Curation,</HEAD>
<P>I here begin with my <HI>Cephalic

I proceed always giving my <HI>Cephalic

in three Dayes time; during
which, <HI>Sweats</HI> rarely happen, until
the <HI>Drowsiness</HI> be wholly over; but
now and then loose <HI>Stools.</HI> And in
real <HI>Apoplexies, Nature</HI> stirs up <HI>Vo∣mitings,
Sneezings, Bleedings</HI> at <HI>Nose,</HI>
or else expels by Urine great Quanti∣ties
of insipid Water void of Odour.</P>
<P><HI>Note:</HI> Where <HI>Vomitings</HI> are, which
<PB N="116" REF="66"/>
usually precede an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> if any

<HEAD>A particular Example of the Method

<P>THis Lady alwayes dreading an
<HI>Apoplexy,</HI> by reason her <HI>Relations</HI>
had often dyed of the same; desired
I would give Order, in Case of a sud∣den
Assault, what should be used
Whereupon I left with her Woman
some of my <HI>Arcanum Metallorum,</HI> gi∣ving
charge, That if the Lady were
suddenly taken with <HI>Vomiting,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Lightheadedness,</HI> she should give that
to her first, and not the <HI>Pouder,</HI> thô
she was formerly used to take it; and
to send immediately away for me,
because she then lived four Miles ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of <HI>London.</HI> This Assault happening
my <HI>Arcanum</HI> given, and I sent for, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="117" REF="66"/>
hastning thither, found her drowsie,
thô the Cold and Stupidity were some∣what
less, than before the taking what
I had left for her. I then gave her
the <HI>Arcanum Antimonii Basilii;</HI> which
is not used or known by any one else
that I can tell: After the taking of
which, <HI>Warmth</HI> increased, a little
<HI>Sneezing</HI> hapned, <HI>Vrine</HI> came away
abundantly; insomuch, that in six
hours time, there was above 3 Pints
of Water received, void of all Urinous
Odour, or <HI>Saline Tast.</HI> The Head
grew hot, Bloud issued by Drops at
the Nosethrils; these Actions happen∣ed
in the first six hours after the As∣sault.
After this, the Spirit became
more lively, and the Bloud more fre∣quently
issued out at Nose and Mouth,
which continued more or less for three
daies together: In the mean time her
<HI>Sleeps</HI> were short, but refreshing. Then
my <HI>Pouder</HI> was given every 4 hours,
my <HI>Arcanum Metallorum</HI> once in 12
hours, and my <HI>Cephalic Cordial</HI> once
an hour. And in four daies time, all
<PB N="118" REF="67"/>
<HI>Symptomes</HI> of the <HI>Disease</HI> vanished,
<HI>Weakness</HI> only remained.</P>
<P><HI>Note:</HI> This Cure being taken in
hand before the <HI>Brain</HI> was fully stu∣pified,
the <HI>Remedies</HI> had the greater
Effect; for I have (to my Grief) too
often seen the same <HI>Medicines</HI> prove
useless, thô the <HI>Dose</HI> was given in a
threefold Quantity; and where they
were serviceable to prevent the Evil,
they did not bring away so much
Bloud, but caused <HI>Sneesings,</HI> and <HI>Vrine</HI>
in like Quantity, and Frequency. Also
I have observed, that <HI>Direct Vomito∣ries,</HI>
given in this <HI>Disease,</HI> (as they
too often are) are as dangerous, as
things repressing <HI>Vomits,</HI> before the
<HI>Patient</HI> is throughly seized with the
Disease; but after the <HI>Stupor</HI> is at its
height, a forcible <HI>Vomit,</HI> if it operate
strongly enough, may do good, other∣wise
the <HI>Patient</HI> certainly dies. The
same may be said of <HI>Sacrification, Phle∣betomy,</HI>
(thô that carry a seeming Con∣veniency
in Sanguineous <HI>Apoplexies)
<PB N="119" REF="67"/>
Blistering, Clysters,</HI> and other forcible
things, which cannot separate the San∣guineous
Matter, except accidentally
only; therefore are uncertain helps;
whereas <HI>Medicines</HI> of an <HI>Vniversal
Tendency,</HI> and truly gifted, act just as
<HI>Nature</HI> requires, and so frequently act
with greater force and certainty, than
any of a <HI>Specific</HI> operation can do.
But there is too often a great failing
in <HI>Physicians,</HI> that they discern not
<HI>Apoplexies</HI> before they seize, and so
cannot contribute help for prevent∣ing
them; which is much to be be∣wailed.</P>

<HEAD>Of Imposthumes.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IMposthumes</HI> are as various as the
<HI>Juyces</HI> of the Body, yet all of them
have but one Original, which is
the <HI>Retents</HI> of Superfluities, not
capable to be separated without <HI>Aper∣tion</HI>
of the Skin; except such <HI>Reme∣dies</HI>
be used that can further the <HI>Re∣solution</HI>
of what is <HI>Congealed</HI> or <HI>Stag∣nized;</HI>
which <HI>Resolution,</HI> so procured,
yields more ease to <HI>Nature,</HI> and is
performed with less <HI>Anxiety,</HI> than
when turned into <HI>Quitter.</HI> For it is
clear, if <HI>Nature</HI> can separate things,
without Corrupting them, her Go∣vernment
is not then much blemish∣ed;
in the performance of which, <HI>Ge∣neral
Medicines</HI> are only capable to
assist her. Here Books must be laid
aside, all <HI>Recipes</HI> dis-esteemed, con∣clusive
Judgment, and all <HI>Indications</HI>
neglected, but <HI>Nature</HI> wholly tended,
and referred to; We in the mean
while (by a due application of suit∣able
<PB N="121" REF="68"/>
<HI>Remedies)</HI> adding <HI>Light</HI> to her
to act by, and <HI>Power</HI> to overcome the
present <HI>Stagnization.</HI> For in so doing,
the <HI>Scene</HI> is altered, and <HI>Nature</HI> ren∣dred
capable with ease to remove
<HI>That,</HI> which before could not be re∣moved,
without too great Molesta∣tion.
For the Wisest of Men, upon
the first Appearance of a <HI>Tumor,</HI> can∣not
by any known Rule judge of <HI>Na∣ture's
Capacity</HI> or Propensity to deter∣minate
the <HI>Evil;</HI> or whether it be
more profitable to resolve, or suppu∣rate
the same. As is apparent in some
<HI>Tumors,</HI> where by attempting <HI>Resolu∣tion,</HI>
the subtillest or thinnest Parts
being separated, the <HI>Remainder</HI> is so
indurated, as not to be resolved or sup∣purated;
and so it becomes the same,
that <HI>Chyrurgeons</HI> call a <HI>Schirrus.</HI></P>
<P>But, in suppurating <HI>Tumors,</HI> great
<HI>Pains, Anguish,</HI> and different <HI>Symp∣tomes,</HI>
in differing forms of <HI>Heats,
Colds,</HI> &amp;c. often happen; through the
Distress <HI>Nature</HI> falls under, by reason
of the Largeness of the <HI>Tumor,</HI> and the
<PB N="122" REF="69"/>
difficulty to bring such Evils to per∣fect
Suppuration: and at last, unless
they open themselves and be judici∣ously
handled, they are often changed
from one thing into another. For,
'tis evident, that the Opening of some
<HI>Tumors</HI> by <HI>Incision,</HI> and keeping them
open by cramming in of <HI>Tents</HI> (a
Practice too often used) doth either
change the nature of the <HI>Tumor,</HI> or at
least prolong the Cure. Whereas, in
either Case <HI>(viz.</HI> in <HI>Resolution,</HI> or <HI>Sup∣puration)</HI>
if <HI>Nature</HI> be well minded,
no such <HI>Symptomes</HI> or Accidents hap∣pen.</P>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> if such <HI>Errors</HI> be committed,
as is daily obvious they are, in Exter∣nal
<HI>Imposthumes,</HI> how much more in
the <HI>Internal</HI> (I mean not those, that
are internally caused by <HI>Contusion,</HI>
or other Acts of Violence; because of
them I have elsewhere spoken) which
are never seen, or known, but by
their Effects? thô, in truth, every
<HI>Internal Imposthumation</HI> hath the same
occasional Cause, as the <HI>External</HI>
have: For they, being also caused by
<PB N="123" REF="69"/>
the Relicts of Nourishment not sepa∣rated,
fall under the Laws of a distur∣bed,
or sensible <HI>Spirit;</HI> which makes
so great Variety in them, not sensibly
to be discerned by the <HI>Physician,</HI> that
he must of necessity, either refer him∣self
to the help of such virtual <HI>Reme∣dies,</HI>
as are capable to take off the
Disturbance, and fortifie the sensible
Power of right Distinction in <HI>Nature;</HI>
or he can never arrive to so much
Satisfaction in himself, as (Scientifi∣cally)
to declare how, or which way,
the Disease is, or may be cured. This
is, by reason of the great Uncertainty
of the Inclination of <HI>Nature</HI> in these
Cases: for sometimes shee seeks to
resolve, or maturate the <HI>Relict,</HI> in the
<HI>Place,</HI> where it is, which is a true na∣tural
<HI>Way;</HI> at another time invirons
the same with a <HI>Cistis,</HI> in order to
Suppuration; and at another Season,
and in another Place, sends forth <HI>Bloud</HI>
out of the <HI>Veins,</HI> intending thereby to
separate that <HI>Retent</HI> (without <HI>Dige∣stion)</HI>
by the common <HI>Passages;</HI> which,
if stopped or letted by the way, quick∣ly
<PB N="124" REF="70"/>
tends to <HI>Pus:</HI> and then (if in that
form it be separated) the Irruption is
so violent, that it sometimes proves
mortal; as is too frequently apparent
by those <HI>Cataracts</HI> of <HI>Bloud</HI> and <HI>Mat∣ter,</HI>
that (in such Cases) issue out by
the <HI>Nosethrils,</HI> by the <HI>Vreters,</HI> by
<HI>Vomiting,</HI> by <HI>Stools,</HI> and by the <HI>Womb.</HI>
Here <HI>Nature</HI> her self erroneously acts,
like those <HI>Physicians,</HI> who inconside∣rately
attempt to purge out <HI>Retents</HI>
before they are digested, contrary to
the Mind of <HI>Hippocrat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and the
known Rule of <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> who saith,
<HI>Every Disease</HI> (to which I add, <HI>every
Diseasy-Inclination) ought to be cured
in its own place.</HI> For 'tis evident, that
some <HI>Imposthumes</HI> are not wholly San∣guineous;
and the <HI>Retents,</HI> being rare∣ly
such, (because the <HI>Veins</HI> as they
have their own <HI>Valves,</HI> so they have
their peculiar <HI>Passages</HI> to evacuate
<HI>Superfluities</HI> by) the <HI>Bloud</HI> that at∣tends
them, is rather in order to <HI>Re∣solution,</HI>
than <HI>Putrefaction,</HI> provided
<HI>Nature</HI> be in her own <HI>Path;</HI> but if di∣verted
therefrom, either through the
<PB N="125" REF="70"/>
want of <HI>Light</HI> in her self to act by, or
the <HI>Physician</HI>'s Error (in mis-applica∣tion
of <HI>Remedies)</HI> those sad Effects,
above spoken of, do inevitably follow.
For every <HI>Retent,</HI> which <HI>Nature</HI> can
neither resolve nor digest, (being for∣saken)
naturally corrupts, by the Heat
and Moisture of the <HI>Place,</HI> and so ma∣keth
a real <HI>Imposthume:</HI> but <HI>Experi∣ence</HI>
proves, that those Actions of Cor∣rupting,
may be prevented by a time∣ly
application of suitable Remedies;
as is apparent by the following Ex∣ample.
Where <HI>Relicts</HI> of preceeding
<HI>Feavers</HI> are, there <HI>Nature</HI> sends <HI>Bloud</HI>
to be materiated, to maturate by pu∣trefaction
the offending Evil, in order
to its Expulsion; but if prevented by
due Medicines, and Transpiration hap∣pens,
then no Putrefaction follows.
For where proper Means are used,
Bloud <HI>(extra Vasa)</HI> is not corrupted,
but kept from putrefying, or other∣wise
resolved without <HI>Pus;</HI> I my self
having often seen Bloud after long ex∣travasation
coughed up dry and hard,
without the least Sign of Putrefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="71"/>
Likewise every <HI>Vessel</HI> (of what kind
soever) being over-filled, and <HI>Nature</HI>
not capable to separate the same by
the Common Passages; that Fullness
(by her forsaken) becomes the Matter
of <HI>Imposthumes.</HI> Or if any Matter be
stagnized, that also is liable to the
same Transchangement, and produceth
Effects as bad, or worse than the for∣mer;
as is sufficiently witnessed by
the <HI>Dry Belly-Ache</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI>
and by some of our Country-Men af∣flicted
with the <HI>Scurvey,</HI> in whom the
Knots in their Nerves give a palpable
Testimony, not only of <HI>Siagnization,</HI>
but also of preternatural <HI>Congelation;</HI>
not much unlike to our knotty <HI>Gouis,</HI>
or <HI>Tophuses</HI> in the <HI>Lues,</HI> which hap∣pen
upon the <HI>Bones;</HI> where, for want
of <HI>Internal Attraction</HI> of the Parts, or
<HI>External Separation</HI> from them, the
nutritive Juice of the Parts is indura∣ted,
and thereby becomes the Matter
it afterwards shews it self to be. For,
when a floating <HI>Evil,</HI> or <HI>Diseasy Spi∣rit</HI>
undetermin'd, assaults the Life;
then <HI>Nature</HI> sends forth Bloud out of
<PB N="127" REF="71"/>
the <HI>Veins,</HI> to encompass that Spiritu∣al
Evil, to materiate the same, and
so makes <HI>Fiery Phlegmones,</HI> and Dis∣eases

the Disease.</P>
<P>The Cure hereof was thus per∣form'd;
The first day I gave my <HI>Pou∣der</HI>
once in 4 hours, my <HI>Arcanum
Veneris</HI> at Night, and my <HI>Aperitive
Spirit</HI> in Drink, as often as the Child
drank; and outwardly I applied my
<HI>Resolving Oyl.</HI> After the first or second
Day (continuing the same Method)
I found the <HI>Tumor</HI> did not increase in
Magnitude, but the Dolour was much
augmented, till two Nights were past.
The third Night, the Pain lessened,
and within a Day or two after, the
Child being taken with great Sick∣ness,
and Vomiting, a large quantity
of suppurated Matter was cast forth;
and no sooner was a cessation of that
Vomiting, but great Coughing hap∣pened,
whereby more of the same pu∣trid
Matter was plentifully spit up.
After which, the Child falling to sleep,
and resting, no more Vomiting fol∣lowed;
<PB N="131" REF="73"/>
but the Coughing and Spit∣ting
continued (by Intervals) for 3
daies together. This time expired, the
Coughing began to abate, and the
Urine thenceforth was filled with pu∣rulent
Matter, which continued to
come forth in great quantity (with
the Urine) for 7 daies together, not
seeming to be diminished in all that
Time. About the eighth day hap∣pened
a loose <HI>Stool</HI> (the Child having
been costive all the time before) in
which appeared the same purulent
Matter, as was before separated by
Vomiting, Coughing, and Urine. From
that time, the Urine began to clear,
and so continued clearing each Day
unto perfect <HI>Recovery.</HI> In this Cure
no other Medicines were used, than

<HEAD>Example. 1. Of an Imposthume in the Womb
of a Woman with Child.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Woman,</HI> about seven Months gon
with Child, was afflicted with great
Pain and Torture in her Womb;
which manifested the proper Signs
of a contra-natural Cause existent, by
Issue of <HI>Bloud</HI> (not <HI>Flouding-like,</HI>
but by <HI>Driblings)</HI> at last of <HI>Quit∣ter.</HI>
Upon these apparent Signs of
a suppurated <HI>Imposthume,</HI> I was sought
for and hearing what had hap'ned,
could not but give Judgment of an
<HI>Imposthume</HI> present. Yet, having
read <HI>Hipocrates</HI> (of whose <HI>Sinceri∣ty</HI>
and deep <HI>Skill,</HI> in curing <HI>Diseases</HI>
of his time, no Prudent <HI>Man,</HI> unto
this day, doubts) and finding him
to proclaim <HI>Imposthumes,</HI> and <HI>Vlcers</HI>
of the <HI>Womb,</HI> not curable in <HI>Women</HI>
with <HI>Child,</HI> I was very loath to be
<PB N="154" REF="85"/>
concern'd in this Case: but, Impor∣tunity
and Necessity overweighing,
I adventur'd to apply my self to the
Cure. In order to which I first gave
my <HI>Pouder,</HI> once in 8 hours, and
my <HI>Arcanum Veneris,</HI> at Night going
into <HI>Bed.</HI> This <HI>Method</HI> was continu∣ed
every <HI>Day,</HI> without other <HI>Medicines</HI>
(except some small <HI>Cordials</HI> for <HI>Sup∣port)</HI>
unto the time of her Delive∣ry.
During which space of Time,
after the taking these <HI>Medicines, Mat∣ter</HI>
flowed each Day more than o∣ther,
for a great part of that time;
in which time her <HI>Pains</HI> neverthe∣less
vanished, and she grew more live∣ly,
than before; but when the time
of her Delivery drew near, the Mat∣ter,
that came forth, was less and
less each day. After Delivery, I
viewing the <HI>Bag,</HI> in which the Child
had been contained, did plainly dis∣cern
the Compass of the <HI>Imposthume,</HI>
and some part of the <HI>Matter</HI> unresol∣ved,
upon the Out-side of the <HI>Bag.</HI>
But afterwards to this same <HI>Woman,</HI>
so well delivered of a Sound and
<PB N="155" REF="85"/>
well proportioned <HI>Child,</HI> I gave my
<HI>Medicines</HI> (all the time of her lying

<HI>Strength,</HI> and after this had several
other Children, and is now alive, tho

<P>A <HI>Woman</HI> with <HI>Child,</HI> before quick∣ning,
being swelled (to outward

sent for me: I seeing the <HI>Wo∣man,</HI>
and hearing how it was with her,
could not but be amazed, and doubt
of the reality of her Conception. Ne∣vertheless
because. I well knew the
certainty, and effecacious Power of
my <HI>Medicines</HI> (above specified) in
Cases no less deplorable, I rejected all
thoughts of particular Remedies, and
applyed my self to that general Me∣thod
<PB N="156" REF="86"/>
I had formerly used. Accor∣dingly,
I gave my <HI>Pouder,</HI> Night and
Morning, for three days; yet no
separation hap'ned during that
time; but the <HI>Woman</HI> found her self
somewhat more lively than before.
The fourth Day, I gave my <HI>Arcanum
Metallorum,</HI> and the following Mor∣ning
my <HI>Pouder:</HI> That Day came
forth a Dribbling of <HI>Water,</HI> and the
next Day more. This Method I con∣tinued,
and, in three Days time after,
more than too Gallons of <HI>Water,</HI> was
voided, and the <HI>Dropsy</HI> separated.
Then I ordered the <HI>Pouder</HI> to be ta∣ken
<HI>Night</HI> and <HI>Morning,</HI> until Quick∣ning;
and all the time after of her
being with Child, I prescribed to her
the same <HI>Pouder,</HI> to be taken a Day
or two at a time, whensoever any
Appearance of a Return of the <HI>Dropsy</HI>
was; and, by this means, she went
out her full time, had a sound <HI>Child,</HI>

continued Well and in <HI>Health</HI> for

<P>In this sad Case, the Neck of the

a third; as was clearly testified by divers
Midwifes then present: The <HI>Sanies,</HI> that
flowed from thence, was Red, Yel∣low,

of Metals, and (perhaps) the next
Night my <HI>Arcanum Veneris,</HI> changing
them as I saw occasion; but my <HI>Pou∣der</HI>
I always gave once a Day. Du∣ring
this Cure, many Changes and
Accidents hap'ned, to which I appli∣ed

<HEAD>Example. 5. Of a Mola.</HEAD>
<P>Being called to a <HI>Woman,</HI> labour∣ing
under great <HI>Floudings,</HI> who con∣ceited
her self to be with <HI>Child;</HI> when
I had observed the great quantity of
<HI>Bloud,</HI> that came from her, the Mid∣wife
(then present) gave me an ac∣count
of the closure of the <HI>Womb;</HI>
and so, an Impossibility of distin∣guishing
the Concern. I finding her
Case such, caused the <HI>Pouder</HI> to be
given twice in one hour; in which
time, the Flux of <HI>Bloud</HI> began to
stop, and the <HI>Womb</HI> to open a little,
yet no more than sufficed to admit
<PB N="160" REF="88"/>
the Midwifes finger to distinguish
somewhat unusual. Whereupon I
desired her to give me some more
plain Testimony of what she felt;
and by her words I judged it to be no
<HI>Child.</HI> And as I judged, so it proved:
for, when the Midwife could some∣what
better reach, what she had be∣fore
touched, she brought forth a
Gleuy Matter, white and clear: I,
seeing this, ordered her to bring it
away as fast as she could; but, she
(having no more place open, than
for one Finger to enter) brought it
away by piece-meal, I giving some
Cordial for support to the afflicted
<HI>Woman,</HI> in the mean time. This
Matter I caused (when as much was
brought away, as possibly could be
by the Midwifes Finger) to be put in∣to
a Bason of <HI>Water,</HI> where it joyned
all together, and seemed in quantity
to be no less than a Quart would con∣tain.
Now because (without force)
the <HI>Womb</HI> could be no further open∣ed,
the Remainder was left to the
power of <HI>Medicine.</HI> Therefore I gave
<PB N="161" REF="88"/>
my <HI>Pouder</HI> every hour for twenty
four hours; at the end of which, this
sadly distressed <HI>Woman</HI> began to be
pretty sedate and quiet, and no <HI>Bloud</HI>
appeared: for I think she had before
evacuated all, or the greatest part of
all she had. Then I gave my <HI>Pouder</HI>
twice or thrice a Day, for several
Dayes after, and sometimes my <HI>Ar∣canum
Veneris.</HI> During this <HI>Cure</HI> the
<HI>Cleansings</HI> were not <HI>Sanguineous,</HI> but
<HI>Aqueous,</HI> and continued for Seventy
two Days. In all which time no
<HI>Bloud</HI> appeared, but a <HI>Cleansing Water,</HI>
sometimes of one Colour, sometimes
of another, as is <HI>Common</HI> to other
<HI>Women</HI> After this, she each Day in∣creased
in Strength, and at length be∣came

safe than any other commonly known

Note at this Day: because it is not
only subservient to Nature in prevent∣ing

also (if timely taken) sufficient to
enervate, or nullifie their existence
when formed. For in the Primary
Assault of any <HI>Disease</HI> (that is, upon
the first perceivance of Illness) being
once or twice taken, it either wholly
prevents the growth and increase of

<P>In <HI>Diseases</HI> arriv'd to some height,

than in Congealed <HI>Distempers;</HI>
because being a <HI>Medicine</HI> truly Natu∣ral,
<HI>Nature</HI> can use it either way, to
her own benefit.</P>
<P>In <HI>Pleurisies, Bruises,</HI> and all <HI>Im∣posthumes</HI>
inward or outward, it will
compleatly answer the <HI>Desire</HI> of a

<HI>Putrefaction;</HI> and thô it cannot
always prevent <HI>Imposthumation,</HI> or
hinder <HI>Putrefaction</HI> when begun; yet
it ripens the Matter begun to be Pu∣trified,
and afterwards expels it when
perfectly digested.</P>

and speedy <HI>Cure,</HI> even to admiration;
also in the <HI>Griping of the Guts,</HI> at∣tended

<PB N="166" REF="91"/>
as is scarcely credible; yet the

accomplisheth the Work, by loosening
the Belly.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> taken in the be∣ginning

Purging,</HI> or <HI>Sweats,</HI> and then
binds the <HI>Body</HI> (as is fit) and brings
out the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> fortifying the Life
as far as it is gifted for that work.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Jaundies,</HI> no <HI>Medicine,</HI> that

<P>This <HI>Pouder,</HI> frequently taken,
prevents the Formation of <HI>Worms</HI> in

<P>In <HI>Surfeits,</HI> contracted from <HI>Ex∣cesses</HI>
of <HI>Meats, Drinks,</HI> or over-great

it either causeth <HI>Vomitings,</HI> or <HI>Stools,</HI>
or provokes <HI>Sweats</HI> powerfully, there∣by
to clear the first <HI>Digestion,</HI> or re∣solve
the <HI>Congelation,</HI> caused by those
<HI>Excesses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="91"/>
In <HI>Convulsions,</HI> it is highly service∣able,
as (in the <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Convulsions</HI> I
have largely shewed;) and if given
to <HI>Children</HI> newly Born, and for some
time used, it prevents such <HI>Fits,</HI> by
carrying off those Crudities <HI>Children</HI>
bring with them into the <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P>In all highly Malignant, and <HI>Pesti∣lential
Diseases,</HI> it proves it self a
true Succour to <HI>Nature,</HI> if taken eve∣ry
four hours. For in such <HI>Cases</HI> it
acts vigorously towards expelling all
<HI>Venomes.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Feminine Diseases,</HI> all Intempe∣rancies,
Inordinancies, and Distempe∣ratures
of the <HI>Womb,</HI> 'tis a certain and
speedy <HI>Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Women</HI> with <HI>Child</HI> take the <HI>Pou∣der</HI>
upon any Sense of Illness, or where
a Tendency to <HI>Abortion</HI> is; it pre∣vents
the Danger thereof by streng∣thening
the <HI>Womb.</HI> In the <HI>Birth</HI> it
brings on <HI>Pains,</HI> and hastens the <HI>La∣bour</HI>
with <HI>Safety;</HI> but if the natural
time of <HI>Delivery</HI> be not near, it re∣streins
<HI>Pains</HI> until that time comes.
It stops <HI>Floudings,</HI> facilitates the <HI>Birth,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="92"/>
and cleanseth as is fit, curing the
<HI>After-Pains;</HI> and in <HI>Women Lying in,</HI>
answereth the Necessities of the Pa∣tient,
either in <HI>Cleansing</HI> or <HI>Streng∣thening.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise, the <HI>Monthly Flux</HI> is by
this <HI>Remedy</HI> brought into due Order;
if inordinate, it checks that inordi∣nancy;
if too little or not at all, it
brings down the same in due time and
Order; being taken at certain times
of the <HI>Moon,</HI> with respect had to the
<HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Women</HI> or <HI>Young Maids.</HI> There∣fore,
in the <HI>Latter</HI> (with other small
helps) it sometimes cures the <HI>Green-Sickness,</HI>
altering the Inordinacy of
the <HI>Appetite,</HI> and brings them to a
due <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Health,</HI> and right <HI>Colour</HI>
of <HI>Complexion.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Piles</HI> and <HI>Hemorrhoids</HI> it is
a <HI>Medicine</HI> of singular use: for it
opens the <HI>Piles,</HI> or dissolves them; it
opens also the <HI>Hemorrhoids,</HI> and
cures them when open'd, preventing
<HI>Vlcers</HI> in the Parts.</P>
<P>Also in the Sore or Ulcerated
<HI>Breasts</HI> of <HI>Women,</HI> this <HI>Pouder</HI> is of
great Service.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="92"/>
It strengthens a weak <HI>Stomach,</HI>
enabling it to retain the <HI>Food,</HI> and
digest it; especially if taken so soon as
the Parties have eaten. And in all
Weaknesses of old Age, so far as the
first Digestion is concerned, it is of
use.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dose</HI> to a <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Woman,</HI> full
grown, is <HI>ʒj.</HI> to a <HI>Child</HI> newly-born,
7 or 10 <HI>gr.</HI> and so proportionably to
all <HI>Ages,</HI> between the <HI>Birth</HI> and full
<HI>Growth.</HI> It is to be repeated once in
4, 6, 8, or 12 hours, according to the
manner of its <HI>Operation,</HI> and the <HI>Ne∣cessity</HI>
of the <HI>Sick.</HI> The <HI>Vehicle</HI> may
be either <HI>Breast Milk, Beer, Ale, Wine,</HI>
or <HI>Mace-Ale,</HI> as the <HI>Patients</HI> best like,
or the Necessity of the <HI>Disease</HI> shall
require.</P>
<P><HI>Note:</HI> In the Use of this <HI>Pouder,</HI>
let the following <HI>General Rule</HI> be al∣wayes
observed. Whether it worketh
by <HI>Vomiting, Purging, Sweating,</HI> or
<HI>Vrine,</HI> so long as any such Operation
lasteth, it ought to be continued; so
likewise, in restreining diseasy <HI>Sweats,</HI>
contra-natural <HI>Vomiting,</HI> or <HI>Purging,</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="93"/>
continue the use of the same, until it be
clearly seen, that <HI>Nature</HI> hath no fur∣ther
need thereof in that Exigency.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Vse and Dose of the Tincture.</HEAD>
<P>In <HI>Apoplexies, Palsys, Vertigoes,</HI>
and <HI>Epilepsies, Rheumatisms, Gouts,
Stone, Stranguries</HI> (too frequent Is∣sues
of the <HI>Scurvey)</HI> and other <HI>Distem∣pers,</HI>
that have their Propagation from
things congealing, or too much acri∣monious,
inferring <HI>Pains</HI> or <HI>Num∣nesses,</HI>
&amp;c. I have by Experience found
this <HI>Tincture</HI> to be of general <HI>Vse</HI>
and <HI>Service,</HI> if taken in the following
Order.</P>
<P>Considering most of the <HI>Diseases</HI>
above-named, are either <HI>Hereditary,</HI>
or of long <HI>Continuance,</HI> or Both, it is
expedient in all the aforesaid <HI>Cases,</HI>
that this <HI>Tincture</HI> be taken daily four
times a Day (in <HI>Beer, Ale,</HI> or <HI>Wine.)</HI>
twenty <HI>Drops</HI> at a time, when the <HI>Sto∣mach</HI>
is most empty; but more espe∣cially;
let it be taken in the <HI>Morning</HI>
fasting, and at Night going into Bed,
<PB N="171" REF="93"/>
without mixing the same with any
<HI>Specific,</HI> or direct-working <HI>Medicine:</HI>
though (it must be understood) that
this <HI>Tincture</HI> must never be taken, but
in some Liquor, or other.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scorbutick Affects,</HI> appearing in
other forms than above described, use
the <HI>Tincture</HI> in the same manner, un∣til
the <HI>Diseases</HI> be abated, never using
any other <HI>Medicine</HI> with it, except
my <HI>Pouder,</HI> or other <HI>Medicines</HI> above
specified in the <HI>Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Scurvy;</HI>
only the <HI>Dose</HI> must sometimes be in∣creased;
as it must also in all Ten∣dencies
to Stagnization, whereof chil∣ness,
and coldness are fore-runners.</P>
<P>In all <HI>Impurities</HI> of the <HI>Bloud,</HI> of
what kind soever, whether <HI>Pox, Sur∣fets,
Scabs, Tetters, Scales, Ring-worms,
Spots, Freckles, Morphews,
Sores</HI> in the <HI>Mouth,</HI> or other <HI>Parts,</HI>
if constantly taken (in manner afore∣said)
for a Month together, <HI>viz.</HI> Four
times a Day, or as often as the affli∣cted
<HI>Party</HI> drinks, and the external
<HI>Parts</HI> washed, with his (or her) <HI>Vrine</HI>
every Morning and Evening, it will
<PB N="172" REF="94"/>
prove it self a very effectual <HI>Re∣medy.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Green-Sickness,</HI> and <HI>Femi∣nine
Obstructions,</HI> this <HI>Tincture</HI> is of
singular use, if taken three, or four
times a Day in <HI>Drink:</HI> For, it restores
their lost <HI>Complexion,</HI> and opens all
Obstructions of <HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Liver.</HI>
Also it cleanseth the <HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Reins,</HI>
easeth the <HI>Dolours</HI> of the same; and
is of admirable <HI>Service,</HI> in <HI>Hypochon∣driac
Melancholy.</HI> But in these <HI>Di∣stempers</HI>
it must be taken in all <HI>Drinks,</HI>
or <HI>Liquid Meats</HI> the <HI>Patients</HI> use,
<HI>viz.</HI> 15 Drops at a time, and con∣stantly
every Day, until their Affli∣ctions
are altered</P>
<P>In the <HI>Distempers</HI> of <HI>Old,</HI> or de∣clining
<HI>Age,</HI> as <HI>Asthma's, Coughs,</HI> &amp;c.
that arise from the debility of the
<HI>Transpirative Faculties;</HI> by reason of
which, they labour under shortness
of <HI>Breath,</HI> and troublesom <HI>Phlegm,</HI> it
is beneficial. For, althô this <HI>Tincture</HI>
cannot wholly take off these <HI>Distem∣pers</HI>
from aged <HI>Persons,</HI> yet it doth
much alleviate them; provided it be
<PB N="173" REF="94"/>
frequently taken, and that in a large
<HI>Quantity,</HI> viz. 40 Drops at Night go∣ing
into Bed, and also every Morning
fasting.</P>
<P>In <HI>Suppression, Difficulty,</HI> or <HI>Sharp∣ness
of Vrine,</HI> it is an Effectual <HI>Reme∣dy,</HI>
if 20 Drops be taken Morning and
Evening in <HI>Mace-Ale,</HI> or in a Deco∣ction
of <HI>Mallowes</HI> if they design Ease;
or <HI>Parsley-Roots,</HI> if they intend Ex∣pulsion.</P>
<P>In <HI>Convulsions, Lethargies,</HI> great
<HI>Pains, Weights,</HI> or <HI>Numnesses</HI> of the
<HI>Head,</HI> it is profitable, if taken 4 times
a Day, 20 Drops at a time.</P>
<P>Against <HI>Pains</HI> in the <HI>Stomach,</HI> and
the <HI>Weaknesses</HI> thereof, it is very effi∣cacious,
if 30, or 40 Drops be taken
at a time, twice or four times a Day
in <HI>Drink</HI> when the <HI>Pains</HI> begin to
invade, and the use thereof continued,
till the <HI>Dolour</HI> ceases. Only in this
Case, let the <HI>Parties</HI> grieved be sure
to take Care, never to eat or
drink, until they are assured, that
what they eat and drank before be
well digested.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="95"/>
In <HI>Imbecillity</HI> of the <HI>Generative Fa∣culty,</HI>
or in <HI>Weakness, Coldness,</HI> and
<HI>Vnaptness</HI> to conceive, this <HI>Tincture</HI>
is very profitable, if twenty Drops at
a time be taken in <HI>Sack,</HI> three times
a Day, <HI>viz.</HI> In the Morning Fasting,
one hour before Dinner, and at four
a Clock after Noon; and the fourth
time at Night going into Bed, in
<HI>Mace-Ale,</HI> especially if the <HI>Pouder</HI> be
us'd with it. This Method must be
continued for a Month together.</P>
<P>For Recovery of Strength in <HI>Con∣sumptions,</HI>
where the <HI>Lungs</HI> are not
Ulcerated, this <HI>Medicine</HI> ought to be
given, by 10 Drops at a time, as often
as the languishing <HI>Party</HI> takes any
thing Liquid (whether <HI>Broth, Milk,
Iellies,</HI> or <HI>Emulsions</HI> of any kind) as also
in all his or her <HI>Drink.</HI></P>
<P>The same <HI>Tincture</HI> is no less effe∣ctual
in the <HI>Jaundies,</HI> if 30, or 40
Drops be taken at a time, in what
<HI>Drink</HI> the afflicted <HI>Party</HI> best liketh,
in the same manner as before; and the
Use thereof continued, till the <HI>Vrine</HI>
be clear, as it was before the <HI>Disease</HI>
invaded.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="95"/>
Against <HI>After-Pains</HI> in <HI>Childbed,</HI>
and to open <HI>Obstructions,</HI> this <HI>Medi∣cine</HI>
effectually yields Relief; if 10
Drops be given to <HI>Women</HI> in that <HI>Con∣dition,</HI>
in their usual <HI>Caudle,</HI> every
time they drink it.</P>
<P>A <HI>Child</HI> of a year <HI>Old</HI> may take 2
Drops, in two Spoonfuls of <HI>Breast-Milk,</HI>
and so proportionably.</P>
<P><HI>Note:</HI> In taking, or administring
this <HI>Tincture</HI> it is very convenient to
be careful, not to suffer your <HI>Selves,
Friends,</HI> or <HI>Patients,</HI> to be over-perswaded,
by any <HI>Arguments</HI> what∣soever,
to take <HI>Purging</HI> or <HI>Solutive
Medicines,</HI> althô your own, <HI>Friends,</HI>
or <HI>Patients Bodies</HI> seem to be some∣what
<HI>Costive:</HI> for so doing you will
much retard the benefit, which would
naturally accrew from this <HI>Tincture,</HI>
by its <HI>Transpirative Vertue.</HI> And let
this also be a <HI>Caution</HI> to <HI>All,</HI> in every
kind of <HI>Distemper,</HI> where this <HI>Medi∣cine</HI>
is used, not to take or intermix
any other things, (except as is above
in this <HI>Treatise</HI> described) with the
same.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="96"/>
Now, because I very well know
the Generality of <HI>People</HI> to be so far
from believing these contrary Opera∣tions,
that they will exclaim against
them, as Impossibilities in <HI>Nature,</HI> I
thought it requisite here to subjoyn
(as is well known to <HI>Practitioners</HI> in
<HI>Chirurgy)</HI> that the Herb <HI>St. Johns-wort,</HI>
doth as certainly dissolve congealed
<HI>Bloud</HI> in <HI>Bruises,</HI> as by Congelation
an incised <HI>Wound, Stab,</HI> or <HI>Prick:</HI>
which being <HI>Actions</HI> so different, may
somewhat plead for the Verity of what
I have written. But, if this single
<HI>Example</HI> be not sufficient, let any
One make Experiment of the Power
of the <HI>Ash-Tree,</HI> cut down (when <HI>Sol</HI>
is in <HI>Gemini,</HI> with the <HI>Girdle of Orion,</HI>
and just ascending) and divided into
small flat Sticks; for any one of them
applied to a <HI>Cut, Stab,</HI> or <HI>Prick,</HI> and
held there for some small time, quickly
and evidently heal the <HI>Wound</HI> without
Suppuration.</P>
<P>Also in <HI>Bruises,</HI> thô large and great,
if a broad piece of that Wood be rub∣bed
gently upon them, he shall find a
<PB N="177" REF="96"/>
sudden Resolution, in the space of a
Quarter of an hour (if this be done
at first) and no <HI>Blackness</HI> appearing:
and if it be apply'd speedily, In <HI>Burns,</HI>
and <HI>Scalds,</HI> no <HI>Blisters</HI> will arise: In
<HI>Stingings</HI> of <HI>Wasps</HI> and <HI>Bees,</HI> and
<HI>Pricks</HI> of <HI>Thorns,</HI> this <HI>Wood</HI> is a speedy
<HI>Remedy,</HI> if presently applied: In
<HI>Bleeding at the Nostrils,</HI> thô very
great and large, if a piece of the <HI>Wood</HI>
be held to the <HI>Nostrils,</HI> and rubbed
just above the Gristle of the <HI>Nose;</HI> you
shall quickly see the <HI>Blood</HI> stopped.
Likewise, in <HI>Bitings</HI> of <HI>Dogs,</HI> thô their
<HI>Teeth</HI> have entred deep, if suddenly
applied, all the <HI>Anguish,</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI>
of those <HI>Bitings</HI> are as suddenly re∣moved.</P>
<P>If a single <HI>Plant</HI> can perform such
various and contrary <HI>Actions,</HI> what
then shall <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals</HI> effect,
wherein all the Seven great <HI>Proper∣ties</HI>
of <HI>Nature</HI> are concentred.</P>
<P>I could enlarge this <HI>Section</HI> with
many other signal <HI>Examples</HI> and
<HI>Proofs,</HI> but I shall conclude all with
this <HI>Corollary:</HI> that, since <HI>Nature</HI> is
<PB N="178" REF="97"/>
the true <HI>Preserver</HI> and <HI>Curer</HI> in all
<HI>Distempers;</HI> and is more active and
subtile for her own Preservation and
Recovery, than any adventitious <HI>A∣gent</HI>
can be. That <HI>Preparation</HI> must
needs be fitter, and more useful (in
those her <HI>Methods)</HI> which attends
and assisteth her <HI>Inclinations</HI> and <HI>A∣ctions;</HI>
than That, which disturbs her
<HI>Intentions,</HI> and imposeth <HI>Operations</HI>
upon her, contrary to her own <HI>De∣signs:</HI>
to which <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Mistakes</HI>
all particular <HI>Medicines,</HI> and the <HI>Ap∣plyers</HI>
of them, are very obnoxious.
Wherefore, if I have had the Blessing
to find out <HI>Medicaments</HI> (universal as
to <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Persons)</HI> which will be
perfectly complyant, and subservient
to <HI>Nature</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Tendencies, as my long
and successful Experience of them per∣swades
me I have done; and whereof
Others may be likewise convinced, if
they will make studious Tryal of my
<HI>Receipts;</HI> I would not have any pre∣judicate
<HI>Person</HI> wonder at this my As∣sertion,
that one and the same indi∣vidual
<HI>Medicine</HI> can congeal and re∣solve,
<PB N="179" REF="97"/>
open and shut, work upwards
and downwards, or (in a word) pro∣duce
quite contrary <HI>Effects,</HI> thô <HI>Some
Doctors</HI> have averred to my <HI>Face,</HI> this
thing to be impossible: For, if <HI>Nature</HI>
in contrary <HI>Exigencies,</HI> cannot but act
contrary ways to her own <HI>Relief;</HI>
then consequently the <HI>Physic</HI> that doth
not forcibly drive <HI>Nature</HI> out of her
<HI>Course,</HI> but officiously follow her in
her own <HI>Motions,</HI> must like an <HI>Hand∣maid</HI>
necessarily trace the <HI>Footsteps</HI> of
her <HI>Mistress.</HI> And what <HI>Man,</HI> that
does but understand, or possess a <HI>Na∣ture,</HI>
is ignorant, that the <HI>Means</HI> and
<HI>Passages</HI> which she takes in Difficulties
for her Succour and Safety, are
strangely different, contrary and my∣sterious;
and yet most ingenious to a
<HI>Miracle?</HI></P>
<L>Here are no Angry flames, only some bright</L>
<L>Beams of plain Truth flowing from Nature's light.</L>
