<P>1. To <HI>procure</HI> and <HI>encrease</HI> good Dreames: A knowing Christian herein, becomes diligent here∣upon, and takes paines in Prayer, preparing all day for <HI>Gods</HI> visits in the night. <HI>Psal. 17. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 2, 3.

And therefore for such Dreames, we ought to <HI>pray,</HI> and to prepare good Matter for them, to implore the <HI>Spirit</HI> poured out, to ponder <HI>Scripture;</HI> to hide <HI>Gods Word</HI> in our hearts; to store up the <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>precious Promises</HI> thereof in our remem∣bring minds; and with the <HI>word</HI> to make meet <HI>Animadversions</HI> up∣on Gods marvellous <HI>works;</HI> to hearken to God, and to walk

with God while we are <HI>awake,</HI> that <HI>he</HI> may the more meet us in out <HI>sleep.</HI> And why might not the minds of men move and be moved in holy and heavenly, as well as in idle and foolish Dreames, were diligence used, and duties discharged?

<P>2. To <HI>improve</HI> and <HI>pursue</HI> such Dreames is a duty. As soon as we are up, to begin good deeds in the day, that may occomplish the good <HI>God</HI> gave in the night. 'Tis said of <HI>Jonah</HI> his <HI>Guord,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> made to <HI>spring</HI> in the night,

<P>1. <HI>Direct:</HI> The Soul of man in Dreames can move <HI>forward</HI> and mount <HI>upward</HI> beyond the abilities of any beast: <HI>Who knows the spirit of a man</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Si enim connexa corpori extra corpus vitam agit: corpore in lectulo cubante ac velut in mor∣te quiescente ipsa naturam corporis transi∣lit. <HI>Athanas.</HI> cont.

<P>2. <HI>Reflect:</HI> The Soul of Man in Dreams can turn <HI>backward</HI> and look over its own motions and imaginations, so as to think what it does think. One illustrates this: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Si cut in sphaerae ludo unus jacit; alter vero refert pilam tamdiu{que} eleganter ludus producitur quā∣diu inter utrius∣que manus jacta &amp; reciprocata pila non excidit, &amp;c. <HI>Chrys.</HI> Orat. 8.</NOTE> <HI>At Tennis there must be two hands, one to smite the Ball for∣ward, and another to beat it backward, or the play ceaseth:</HI> but the Soul of man can do both these with its own Hands, it can send out thoughts from it self, and

cast thoughts back again upon it self, and that in the time of mans sleep: this other sleeping creatures cannot.

<P>Yea that which yet further raises mans <HI>Soul</HI> in its <HI>Rational</HI> part is, that even in Dreames it can imagin those matters that upon the <HI>sensitive</HI> part never made impressions. Does not the <HI>Philosopher</HI> seem to contradict him∣self<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristot. lib. 2.

<P>2. <HI>Satan</HI> to conceale these Soul∣works is subtill: he would not have men discern the <HI>good</HI> of such Dreams as are from <HI>God,</HI> nor the <HI>evil</HI> of such Dreames as from <HI>himself</HI> pro∣ceed.</P>

<P>1. <HI>Nature-light</HI> led many learned <HI>Philosophers</HI> to write much of Dreames: to find out all the faculties and abilities of the Soul, they sought out much, as

<P>3. <HI>Equity:</HI> 'Tis fit men should know things done in them, such things as they are not only receptive of, but operative in, as in the case of Dreames. In such things doth not <HI>God</HI> observe us? <HI>Thou</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 139. 2, 3, 4, 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>knowest my down-lying and up-rising, and understandest my thoughts afar off.

<P>4. <HI>Excellency:</HI> The rarity of this knowledg 'tis found in few.

<P>1. <HI>Filthiness of Sinne:</HI> This is in ge∣nerall applicable to all sinne, all sinne having this common name to be called filthiness, and all such filthiness of what sinne soever, may be acted over in the thoughts of mans minde; and that not only during the day and when he is a∣wake, but also in the night time as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somniando co∣gitat, &amp; cogi∣tando ruminat &amp; ruminando delectatur. <HI>Aug.</HI> concio. 3. in <HI>Psal. 36.</HI></NOTE> he lies asleep, his minde may be mo∣ving and roving upon, delighting and solacing himself in thoughts of Luxury, Gluttony, Avarice, Envy, Pride, Prodi∣gality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>The Sinne of filthiness:</HI> Or that particular sinne of uncleanness strictly so called. This is a deep ditch or puddle∣pit, into which a man may be miserably plunged by the meer imaginations of his minde, <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 28. As a man that hath no body with him, when abroad, may at mid-day be an adulterer in the adulterous thoughts of his heart: so a man that hath no body with him in his bed, may in the sleeping time of the night, be adulterously naught by the filthy Dreames of his minde: and com∣monly
<PB N="96" REF="80"/>
those filthinesses that a mans minde is fixed upon in the day when a∣wake, will visit him in the night, finde him out and fasten upon him in his sleep.</P>

He that came in <HI>Samuels Robe</HI> in the <HI>Serpents form,</HI> yea
<PB N="97" REF="80"/>
transforming himself as an <HI>Angel of Light</HI> to men awake, may not he come in other ways and manners to men asleep? He that can appear as a <HI>roar∣ing Lion,</HI> to affright a waking Chri∣stian; cannot he present himself as an <HI>enticing Damsell,</HI> to affect a sleeping man, and to effect these filthy Dreames? We read of the rich man in the Parable, <HI>He thought within himself saying, What</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quid faciam? interrogantis vox est, &amp; quem put as interroga∣bat iste.

'Tis the voice of one ask∣ing a question: And who (says a good <HI>Author</HI>) do you think he did ask? Though really no body was by, yet the <HI>Devil</HI> being in him, could soon make him conceit some body with him. As a man in his ordinary Dreames ima∣gins he hath his <HI>friends</HI> about him con∣ferring together; so in filthy Dreames man imagins his mates about him and consorts with him: And thus filthiness not fit to be named is nourished.

<PB N="111" REF="87"/>
under which he suffers. He knows which way <HI>nature,</HI> even in corporeal parts is prone to put out it self; and so in flinging the <HI>bowl</HI> he observes the <HI>biass,</HI> beating man upon his own ground, and bringing him to much misery.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Satan</HI> sees much into the state of mans soul. Though the soul as con∣cerning its immanent and immediate acts of the principall powers is so lockt up, as the <HI>Devil</HI> by a <HI>direct intuition</HI> cannot look therein, or have knowledg thereof, yet he can gather much in an <HI>arguitive way,</HI> he can make such <HI>ani∣madversions</HI> of matters without, as to discover much within. Mans under∣standing makes its <HI>parelii</HI> or likenesses and resemblances, and these the <HI>fancy</HI> being neer hand takes in, observes and imitates; and while this is at work the <HI>Devil</HI> may get the key of this <HI>shop,</HI> go in, and view the <HI>Images</HI> that are framed there to set forward his sinfull design: though the <HI>Devil</HI> cannot create or frame in the <HI>fancy</HI> any new corporeall <HI>species,</HI> yet he can discern such <HI>simili∣tudes</HI> and shadows of things as are there already framed; he can <HI>call them up,</HI>

and accordingly <HI>conform</HI> himself, and so fetch forth a suteable draught of Dreames. Unto filthy apprehensions he can cause filthy apparitions, and pitifully puddle a man in polluting Dreames.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Devils</HI> diligence is discern∣able therein to be also great, through that filthiness which he sets forward in the night, and those defilements he fastens upon man in his sleep.

<P>1. <HI>Watch they do not.</HI> A good Chri∣stian indeed sets his soul to watch while his body sleeps.

<P>2. <HI>Pray they do not.</HI> Indeed a godly man cries upon this account against such a sleep of sinne, as <HI>David</HI> against the sleep of death: <HI>Consider and hear me O Lord my God, lighten my eyes lest that I sleep the sleep of death, and mine enemies say I have prevailed against him,</HI> Psal. 13. 3. That the <HI>Devil</HI> prevailing may not triumph, such a one rather desires to sleep in the dust of the earth, than in the lusts of his heart: And desires (while he lives) that rather than the Lord should suffer him to sleep so sin∣ing, he would keep him awake without sleep. But no such matter with these men, by any prayer to <HI>God</HI> in point of prevention.</P>

<PB N="122" REF="93"/>
<HI>Devil</HI> draws it out at his mouth by foul and filthy words when he is awake: so sometimes he draws that dirty pud∣dle all up into his <HI>minde,</HI> by black and beastly thoughts when he is asleep. As at times <HI>God</HI> acts up the graces of the Spirit by sweet and holy Dreames, and rare representations in the night of most blessed matters, to the minds of con∣verted men; so the <HI>Devil</HI> in the night∣time, oft acts up the lusts of the <HI>flesh</HI> by base and wicked Dreames, and wretch∣ed representations to the minds of men unconverted, of <HI>matters</HI> not meet to be mentioned. The <HI>Devil</HI> need not bring any thing with him, onely im∣prove the evil that is already, unto the forming of most filthy Dreames.</P>
<P>2. As <HI>movers</HI> to meet such Dreames these men are free: Their minds are active in sinne, and sinne active in their minds at all seasons. They sleep in sinne, but sinne does not sleep in them; yea though in sinne they certainly sleep, yet to sinne their souls are always awake. They are ready to co-work with <HI>Satan</HI> in sinfull Dreames; so that such things are not onely dreamed in them, but
<PB N="123" REF="93"/>
they are the dreamers of them. The <HI>Devil</HI> does not cause such Dreames without their concurrence, but their corrupt hearts can cause such Dreames without the concurrence of the <HI>Devil.</HI> There is a sea of sinne in their souls may foam and boyl when no wind blows; and when winds of temptations are strong, and the <HI>Devil</HI> does powerfully promote in the minds of men such Dreames of sinne, they may blame themselves.</P>
<P>For he comes thus to <HI>work,</HI> because they <HI>invite</HI> him in the <HI>day.</HI></P>

<P>1. <HI>The Devil is cunning,</HI> and there∣fore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋt faciat ali∣quandò dor∣mientibus, quod non potest vigi∣lantibus. <HI>Aug.</HI> Serm. de Temp.</NOTE> comes in the night: When the servants of God are asleep in their beds, he surprizes them by putting sinfull thoughts in their mindes. 'Twas once <HI>Gods</HI> question to <HI>Satan, Hast thou con∣sidered my servant Job?</HI> God hath not a servant but Satan considers him; as how, so when; as by what means, so at what times his temptations will take best. In the day the <HI>Devil</HI> knows good men are more observant of him, vigilant over him, that by unclean thoughts to carry them aside, he sees small hope. When their bodies are asleep, their mindes are not so well watching, nor their thoughts so resolvedly resisting,
<PB N="126" REF="95"/>
but <HI>Satan</HI> makes advantage of the sea∣son to give his assaults success. Some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qui hujusmodi pisces pis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antur de nocte eos in∣vadunt in tene∣bris. <HI>Aquinas.</HI></NOTE> report, that cunning <HI>Fishers</HI> when they would catch the <HI>Whale, Leviathan,</HI> or such great <HI>Fishes</HI> in the sea, they set to it in the night-time, when the creatures cannot see who <HI>invades them,</HI> nor how to evade them. Thus the <HI>Devil</HI> when he would fain so fish as to catch these choice peeces the precious Saints of God, he subtilly sets upon them in the night, as his fittest time wherein to tempt and take them.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The Devil is a coward:</HI> In the day he dares not oftentimes so assault Gods Saints, when he sees them up in their armour, and so waits till night. As there be wild beasts, in the night they range abroad for their prey, who are afraid to creep out of their dens in the day time, <HI>Psal.</HI> 104. 20.

Such a one is <HI>Sa∣tan.</HI> The Saints of <HI>God</HI> when they are awake, are more ready to the battell,

and then the <HI>Devil</HI> as a base beaten enemy is not so forward to fight them, but he sets upon these souldiers of <HI>Christ</HI> when they are asleep in their quarters.</P>
<P>These things <HI>premised,</HI> 'tis manifest, that as carnal men are the <HI>subjects</HI> of, so Christian men are <HI>subject</HI> to these sinfull Dreames, and therefore men of all sorts are concerned in the ensuing discourse.</P>

</LIST>
<P>1. Such Dreames (or sinfull thoughts in sleep) they take our minds off from

those good watchings and workings as sute to our sleeping times. In the time of sleep, though a mans outward senses are bound, and as servants they cease their ordinary business abroad, yet the inward powers of <HI>phantasie</HI> and <HI>me∣mory</HI> are then most free and best at li∣berty for their proper imployments; now the soul being of <HI>God</HI> furnished with such faculties and abilities, 'tis sad when the <HI>Devil</HI> seduces them, and by sinfull dreamings diverts and pollutes them. As <HI>God</HI> hath created the soul at all times fit for good work, so <HI>God</HI> hath appointed good work for the soul at all times, to wit, meditation upon his <HI>Law day and night,</HI> Josh. 1. 8. Now sinfull Dreames draw us off from this<NOTE PLACE="marg">In collationibus Patrum legitur de quodam, qui semper in die∣bus festis, Somniando pol∣lutionem noctur∣nam patiebatur hoc Diabolo pro∣curante ut im∣pediretur a sa∣cra communio∣ne, &amp;c. <HI>Aquin.</HI> 22ae.

<P>2. Such Dreames they do not onely take our mindes off from good, but take good out of our mindes. We have not the benefit and comfort of the Word of <HI>God</HI> and Spirit of <HI>God</HI> at such times to our thoughts: they are as it were taken from us in respect of the stops hereby to their present exercise. As when <HI>Saul</HI> was asleep in the trench,
<PB N="129" REF="96"/>
<HI>David</HI> took from his very bolster his spear and a cruse of water, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 26. 12. Thus <HI>Satan</HI> in the night when we are asleep in our beds, by bad Dreames gets away our spear and our water, the Word of God that should defend us, and the Spirit of God that should refresh us: Thus of good things are we lamen∣tably left.</P>

<P>1. There be <HI>Commands</HI> which here∣by we transgress: <HI>God</HI> requires that not onely the <HI>soul</HI> but the <HI>body</HI> be set free from all ways of defilement: <HI>Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,</HI> 2 Cor. 7. 1. <HI>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in holiness and honour,</HI> 1 Thes. 4. 4. Not onely the soul which is in the
<PB N="130" REF="97"/>
vessel of the body, but the body which is the vessel of the soul, must be kept clean from soile. We must hate that whereby the garment of the flesh is spotted, as we must <HI>hate the garment spotted of the flesh,</HI> Jude 23. therefore not defile the flesh with Dreames.</P>
<P>2. There be <HI>Mercies</HI> which hereby we abuse: To have <HI>beds</HI> to sleep on, and to have <HI>sleep</HI> upon our beds is a double mercy. Let us mark that expression of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> Matth. 8. 20. <HI>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air nests, but the Sonne of Man hath not where to lay his head.</HI> It may seem Christ had not here any setled bed to sleep up∣on. 'Tis evident <HI>Job</HI> had his bed, but thereon he could not sleep. <HI>Weary some nights are appointed to me; when I lie down I say when shall I arise and the night be gone, I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day,</HI> Job 7. 3, 4. Now to have with our beds to sleep on, sleep upon our beds, are benefits too big to be abused, by the interpose of such prejudiciall Dreames.</P>

<P>1. Hereby the <HI>body</HI> is weakened, na∣ture wasted, corporeall parts as defiled, so enfeebled.

(Beside the evil that may run and reach unto posterity.)</P>
<P>2. Hereby the <HI>Soul</HI> is wounded: The <HI>Devil</HI> hereupon makes great advantage in life and death to dismay the mind. Of such offences he does accuse in a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Noli pecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re nam etsi nox est, Deus videt, Angeli circa cubile astant, Diabolus accu∣sabit, conscien∣tia, testabitur infernus cruci∣abit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> double Court; <HI>The Court of Heaven, the Court of Conscience.</HI> We read <HI>Rev. 12. 10.

He

accuses in the night for sinfull deeds in the day, and he accuses in the day of sinfull Dreames in the night. 'Tis sad when <HI>Satan</HI> keeps assizes in our souls, and actually arraignes, endites and con∣demns, for such dealings as he hath had with us in a way of wicked Dreames.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>punishment</HI> future in the world to come (without the prevention of divine mercy) is everlasting misery. Such Dreames draw to ruine: That which hath a defiling power is of a de∣stroying nature. And if such Dreames be sinne, <HI>The wages of every sinne is death,</HI> Rom. 6. 23.

<P>1. The <HI>Devil</HI> is to be expected to do his endeavours to draw in such Dreames:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Because he is ever malicious,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Because he is ever treacherous.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The <HI>Devils</HI> malice is such, as makes him to do what mischief he may against both good and bad, both day and night. History writes of a <HI>River</HI> that passes through some parts of <HI>America,</HI> that not being fed by any <HI>spring,</HI> but caused by <HI>snow</HI> which the <HI>Sunne</HI> melts down the mountains, it runs strong in the <HI>day,</HI> but

hath no streame in the night. 'Tis not so with <HI>Satan,</HI> such springs of malice and mischief remains in him, that the streams of his temptations run strong by night as well as by day: he hath his night∣works and his night-walks for our per∣petuall prejudice.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Satans</HI> treachery is such, as we can never be secure: He may be as it were bound up in the day, and break loose in the night. <HI>History</HI> makes mention of one <HI>Cleomenes</HI> a Lacedemonian King, who making warre against the <HI>Argives,</HI> he took truce with them for seaven days, and in the third night while they lay secure and asleep in their tents, he broke in upon them and slew them with the edg of the sword; saying, <HI>His truce was for days, and not for nights.</HI> Of such treacherous dealings the <HI>Devil</HI> is full, a <HI>truce</HI> with him is not to be trusted; if he be quiet in the day, he may be coming in the night. He being a <HI>fiend</HI> of darkness as they are deeds of dark∣ness he is most busie about; so they are times of darkness he is most busie in: times both of spirituall and naturall darkness that best suit his designs, so
<PB N="135" REF="99"/>
that he may soonest be suspected by night. Now because he loves to come unlookt for, <HI>provision</HI> may be a good <HI>prevention.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>God</HI> is to be entreated. Prayer to God is a principall means to keep off the <HI>Devil</HI> in such Dreames; because</P>

<P>Upon <HI>Prayer</HI> God affords his pre∣sence with us: this sets the <HI>Devil</HI> at a distance from us. <HI>The Wolfe</HI> (says <HI>Au∣stin) comes to the sheep-fold by night, purposing to prey upon the poor Lambs when they lie asleep; but he findes the sheephard awake and walking about the fold, which forces him back without shed∣ding blood.</HI> Thus the <HI>Devil</HI> he designs to assault by night, but <HI>God</HI> being about our beds he is beaten back: He begins<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de verb. Apo. Ser. 21. Lupus venit ad ovile ovinm quaerit invade∣re, jugulare, de∣vorare. Pasto∣res vigilant, ni∣hil aufert, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> to suggest but cannot go on, <HI>God</HI> being by. <HI>Esth. 7. 8.

force my servant before my face?</HI> then he flies.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Prayer</HI> God fulfills his promise to us. <HI>Isa.</HI> 27. 1. we finde the <HI>Devil</HI> compared to a piercing and crooked Serpent, creeping into Gods vineyard to do it harm; Ai but says <HI>God</HI> of his vineyard, <HI>I the Lord do keep it, lest any hurt it; I will keep it night and day.</HI> In the night the <HI>Devil</HI> comes, but he cannot catch because <HI>God</HI> keeps; nor harm be∣cause <HI>God</HI> helps: <HI>God</HI> hath promised his <HI>Angels</HI> to defend his <HI>Saints,</HI> to encamp about them; which may principally imply night-protection. <HI>Psal.</HI> 34. 7.

<P>2. <HI>Satan</HI> could never so freely go on in his work, but that he finds somewhat in us that does befriend his filthy de∣signs: He meets with that in our hearts that gives him the <HI>hand</HI> for his help: Though he be a <HI>spirit,</HI> yet by the lusts<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diabolus e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si sit spiritus agi∣tat tamen in operibus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnis. <HI>Aug.</HI> de Civit.

<P>2. Actually to <HI>fulfill</HI> it in deeds is very dangerous. 'Tis that the <HI>Devil</HI> indeed drives at, to draw us to do when we are awake, what we dreamt in our sleep. For good things <HI>Satan</HI> is satisfied

we should rest in the apparition and shew thereof, and some slight imaginations thereupon, to have no more but Dreames of grace and holiness, Dreames of glory and happiness: but he is not content that men should take up with imaginary supposals of sinne and some bare thoughts thereupon, but he would have them to bring forth the further fruits thereof: To have more then Dreames of sinne and wickedness, of lasciviousness and wantonness, more then Dreames of adultery, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnication and uncleanness.

<ITEM>2. <HI>They are Disprofiting,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>They are discomforting,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>They are Dishonouring.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. <HI>Displeasing</HI> are vain Dreames to a holy God and men truly good. As <HI>Idol-Images</HI> made by mans hand are for∣bidden of God; so <HI>Idol-Images</HI> made in mans minde are offensive to God. <HI>Ezek. 8. 12. Sonne of man, hast thou seen what the Antients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his Imagery:</HI> or in the secret of their

Calvin.</NOTE> onely in the lightsome day, but in the dark night, not only in the chamber of their house, but in the chamber of their hearts, have such imaginations of vanity, that are like Images of Idolatry, displea∣sing to God: And a man godly is God∣like, displeased with himself, when he findes his heart framing such Images of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Non enim erat apud eum ima∣go non vanit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sed veritas, non effigies ignava sed solida for∣ma justitiae.

<P>Secondly, <HI>Disprofiting</HI> are without doubt vain Dreames: Dreames of va∣nity the minde is busie in, but hath no benefit by. <HI>Tertullian</HI> calleth Dreames,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tertull.</HI> de A∣nim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. cap. 45.</NOTE> <HI>the idle things of the busie soul.</HI> The soul of man as it may be idle in business, so busie in idleness. The soul properly
<PB N="186" REF="125"/>
indeed in idle Dreamings cogitates much and negotiates nothing: nothing to purpose, nothing for profit, and so all is vain. <HI>Almonds</HI> (says One) <HI>men</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ygdal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untur inanes non in quibus nihil est, sed quibus id quod inest est inutile, &amp;c. <HI>Clem. A∣lex.</HI> Stroma∣tum. lib. 7.</NOTE> <HI>account empty and naught, not in which there is nothing found, but in which that which is found is of no profit:</HI> So mens imaginations are said to be <HI>vain,</HI> when though there be many movings therein yet no advantage thereby. By idle Dreames the soul is as a <HI>sieve of vani∣ty,</HI> in which nothing is left but what is <HI>branny</HI> and bootless. Yea as they bring in nothing of benefit, so they keep out what might prove for mans profit: and indeed what a man gaineth not in, he loseth by: A man is the worse for that by which he is not the better.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Discomforting</HI> may men finde Dreames of vanity: Vain Dreames are as <HI>Drone-Bees</HI> that fly out, but bring in no honey, yea that honey in the <HI>hive</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 19. 15. Isa. 29. 8.</NOTE> they finde, they feed upon and devour. In Dreames vain there may seem some∣what pleasing for present, but after disappointments produce more pain than peace. <HI>As a hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth, but he awaketh and
<PB N="187" REF="125"/>
his soul is empty; or as a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh, but he awaketh and his soul is faint.</HI> That<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dum studiorum sublimium vi∣gore mens nostra non constringi∣tur vanitatis infimae fame sauciatur.</NOTE> cannot solace and comfort which does not satisfie and content; but in vain Dreames is nothing <HI>solid</HI> to satisfie, and so the soul is left comfortless, yea in a suffering case. That cannot cause de∣light to the soul, which bereaves the soul of sweet liberty: O how fast is a man bound upon his bed with these <HI>cords of vanity,</HI> so that his soul cannot get loose, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. 18.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Dishonouring</HI> Dreames of vanity, strip the soul of its dignity. <HI>Sca∣liger</HI> observes, that there be <HI>three</HI> things that do distinguish a man from, and dignifie him above all creatures about him, <HI>viz. Reason, Speech,</HI> and <HI>Hands.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Greg.</HI> Past. Cu. <HI>Scaliger</HI> Exer. cit. 256.</NOTE> <HI>Reason</HI> is the first and chief, and that wherein he may and ought most to ex∣cell: A man may much debase himself by the idle <HI>words</HI> of his mouth, and vain works of his <HI>hands,</HI> but nothing renders a man so base as the abuse of his <HI>Reason</HI> in foolish fancies. 'Twas the dishonour of the Emperour <HI>Domitian,</HI> that he spent great part of his time in catching
<PB N="188" REF="126"/>
of flies; and <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> in making box hafts for knives. And does not this re∣dound to mans dishonour, to spend day and night to pass away his time sleeping and waking in a multitude of idle ima∣ginations made up of meer vanities? In such vanities to imploy the minde, is to turn a golden mill to grinde chaff: These poor things disparage mans pre∣cious soul, principled to higher acts and ends. <HI>And O how vain a thing is man, if</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">O quam vana res est homo, nisi supra vana se erexerit.

<P>1.

<P>1. <HI>Sinfull evils,</HI> or evils of sinne, which are of all evils the worst, and by the best men most feared. Sinfull Dreames <HI>Jobs</HI> soul might possibly be assaulted with. If in his sleep were any<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homo Somnian∣do c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gitans de peccatis carna∣libus semper movetur cum aliqua affectio∣ne vel concupis∣centiae vel hor∣roris, &amp;c. <HI>A∣quinas</HI> 22ae. Quaest. 154.

<P><HI>Object.</HI> If these skaring Dreames should be sinfull, How then could God be their causer?</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="133"/><HI>Answ.</HI> Suppose the Devil was the <HI>cause</HI> of the Dreames, yet <HI>God</HI> the <HI>cause</HI> of the fear: The Dreames dreaded from the <HI>Devil,</HI> yet the dreading of the Dreames through <HI>God</HI> and his grace: Where the grace of <HI>God</HI> is not, sinfull Dreames are pleasing, not perplexing: and might <HI>Satan</HI> have his mind, such Dreames should please good men with delight, and not possess them with fear: from <HI>God</HI> it is, that sinne as defiling is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Timor duplex naturalis de malo corporis corruptivo &amp; supernaturalis de malo animae contaminavo. <HI>Aquin.</HI> 12ae.

'Tis from the nature of man to fear <HI>death</HI> that corrupts the bo∣dy, but 'tis from the grace of God to fear <HI>sinne</HI> that pollutes the soul.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Suffering evils,</HI> or evils more purely poenall and painfull, and these evil things most properly proceed from God, and with such evil Dreames <HI>God</HI> did most probably afflict <HI>Job. Job God</HI> might dismay in his Dreames with representations of sinne, not to sinne: Sinnes past <HI>God</HI> might make to appear: What he had done awake, <HI>God</HI> might cause him to see in his sleep with soul∣amazements. But respects to sinne laid aside, the <HI>Lord</HI> in sleep might arrest <HI>Job</HI> as a <HI>Judg.</HI> Though towards evils

of <HI>sinne,</HI> 'tis not fit for <HI>God</HI> to act any thing, he being the purest essence in Heaven, yet 'tis meet for <HI>God</HI> to act about matters of <HI>pain,</HI> he being the su∣pream <HI>Judg</HI> of the earth. <HI>God</HI> is so good, that he is not the least <HI>actor</HI> of sinne: but <HI>God</HI> is so great, as he is the chief inflicter of pain: and though pain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Non solum cul∣pa sed poena est malum, etsa mi∣nus habet ra∣tionem mali, &amp;c. <HI>Aquinas</HI> 1<SUP>a</SUP> Qu. 48. 22ae. Qu. 9.</NOTE> be inflicted of <HI>God</HI> who is good, yet in it self it is evil: and though pain to be sure is a less evil than sinne, yet still it is evil. Sinne is an evil that disturbs <HI>Gods</HI> quiet in Heaven; and pain is an evil that opposes mans peace and rest upon earth. How was <HI>Job</HI> interrupted in his rest, and broken in his peace through painfull and dolorous Dreames, the dread of which, evidences them evil in their nature.</P>
<P>2. In their <HI>Number</HI> considered it seems they were many; not Dreame, but <HI>Dreames</HI> in the plurall: manifold Dreames and Dreames about manifold matters that might amaze him, divers and differing Dreames for degrees and kindes wherewith <HI>Job</HI> was skared: Dreames of fear, that like flames of fire flashed fast in his face: Dreames of
<PB N="204" REF="134"/>
terrors, that like troops of Souldiers upon him thrusting thick in his sleep: Dreames of horror, that like billows of water broke into his chamber and overflowed his bed, that he lay as drowned therein, enduring many do∣lorous thoughts. Many things may a man suffer from one single Dreame, but how many things be suffered, when sad Dreames be multiplied? this was <HI>Jobs</HI> case being skared with Dreames.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>Person</HI> from or by whom <HI>Job</HI> was skared, was God himself, <HI>Thou skarest me.</HI> Had these Dreames<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 6. 16.</NOTE> been barely the Devils-darts, or as burning brands flung into his bed onely by Satans hellish-hand, his heart would not have been so shaked with fear: but<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 6. 4.</NOTE> finding <HI>God</HI> to have his hand therein, and to be the cause thereof, <HI>this, this</HI> en∣creased his skare: <HI>Thou skarest me.</HI> As if he had said; <HI>O Lord thou who in the day of my prosperity wast to me a Paradise of pleasure, causing thy joy to shine as a bright Sunne into my soul, thou didst comfort, ravish me and refresh me oft, yet now thou makst me all agast. Thou who in the night of my adversity, I hoped
<PB N="205" REF="134"/>
wouldst have sent into my heart soul-sweet helps from Heaven, wouldst have set up cleer candles of comfort about my bed: Thou not onely leavest me in the dark, but skarest me with Dreames.</HI> For skares and fears to be from the <HI>Devil</HI> or this wicked world, were no wonder; but for a good man to be frighted of <HI>God,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> will not let him sleep without skaring, this is strange and astonishing:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Judg. 9. 15.

<P>1. The <HI>Majesty</HI> abiding in <HI>God,</HI> may<NOTE PLACE="marg">Incutiunt sacra quendam horro∣rem.</NOTE> be so represented in sleep, as to make Dreames terrible. <HI>Gen. 15. 12.

As the tran∣splendent brightness of the <HI>Sunne</HI> dazles the eye and makes it trickle down wa∣ter; so the surpassing excellency of <HI>Gods</HI> Majesty, dismayes the mind, and makes it tremble with fear.

<P>1. Sometimes hereto <HI>God</HI> moves Single, Solitary, or himself alone. There are some <HI>Dreames</HI> which though they fall with feare, we may be sure they Solely proceed from God, their

<P>1. Present <HI>Peace</HI> they oppose: Dash out Candles of comfort, rout lawfull delights, they put a period to Saints present prosperous estate. Time was when <HI>Job</HI> lay upon his bed and <HI>Gods</HI> candle shined over his head, he went through the darknesse of the night, by the Lords light. <HI>O that I were as in moneths past</HI> (sayes he) <HI>when his Candle shined upon my head, and by his Light I went through dark∣nesse,</HI> Job 29. 3. Now <HI>Job</HI> is upon his bed and the Candle out, he goes through the darknesse of the Night and his Soul sees no Light. Visions he hath, but they are terrifying and all his Dreames skaring. Not onely men but great men mounted in the height of Honour, have been brought down by Dreames of terrour, <HI>Dan. 4. 4, 5. I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house and flourishing in my Palace, I saw a Dreame that made me

<P>2. That <HI>future</HI> ease which men ex∣pect, such Dreames present. When night comes, men lye down and look for rest. <HI>Jacob</HI> in his travells when the Sun was set and Night overtooke him, though he was abroad in the o∣pen fields, and had onely a pillow of stones, yet he slept sweetly and Dreamt comfortably, <HI>Gen.</HI> 28. 11.

<P><HI>Job</HI> had all these. In the Night time he had his House to be in, and his

Bed to lye on, so that he looked for rest but found no refreshment, In stead of being eased he was amazed, In stead of quiet sleeps he had skaring Dreames. He expected the benefit of his Bed, and comfort of his Couch, but his bed was his rack and his couch his torment, whence comes the complaints of the Text. All the comforts that a man hath in hand, or in hope, may be dashed by a dreadfull Dreame.</P>

I have read of a man, who Dreaming he had lost his money, awaked in a fright and immediately went and murder∣ed himself.

Thou skarest me with Dreames and ter∣rifiest me with visions, so that my Soule chuseth strangling, and death rather then life. <HI>Hyppocrates</HI> a learned Physician reports, that some of his patients posses∣sed with these night-perplexities, plung∣ed themselves into deep pits in the day, and divers ways attempted their deaths.</P>
<P>2. Through terrible Dreames a man may fall into much following misery. Hence some have been bereaved of the use of reason and smitten with madness. <HI>Diodate</HI> and other Scripture-Interpre∣ters note, that <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> after his dreadfull Dreame, <HI>Dan.</HI> 4. soon fell into a sad disease called <HI>Lycanthropie,</HI> wherein he lost all manner of humane understanding, forsooke the society of men, became brutish, fierce, and wild like a <HI>Beast,</HI> living in the fields for the space of seven yeers. The dis∣temperatures that were upon his Dreames, and the terrors upon the In∣terpretation thereof did dispose him thereunto. Hence some men have been as it were in hell, while they have<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polidor. Virgil. <HI>Ang.</HI> hysto. <HI>lib. 25.</HI></NOTE> been on earth.

<P>2. In the <HI>times</HI> of the <HI>Prophets, God</HI> did by Dreames declare much of his mercifull minde to men.

</LIST>
<P>1. We find, in the <HI>Apostles</HI> times were Heavenly Dreames. May we not say that sometimes in Dreames <HI>God</HI> spake to the Apostles, when to them 'tis plain God appeared in visions. As the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> when God would have him go and preach the Gospell to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> for their conversion to the Christian Faith, <HI>he fell into a trance, and saw Heaven opened and a certain vessell descending,</HI> &amp;c. Acts 10. 10, 11, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And when <HI>God</HI> would have the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to goe preach the Gos∣pel to the <HI>Macedonian</HI> people, a visi∣on appeared to <HI>Paul</HI> in the <HI>night. There stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying, come over to Macedonia and help us,</HI> Acts 16. 9. We may ima∣gine 'twas a Dreame in his sleep it be∣ing a vision in the night. Though vi∣sions in the day, were when men were awake, yet visions in the night were ordinary in sleep. Thus <HI>Eliphaz. In
<PB N="266" REF="165"/>
thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falleth on men,</HI> Job 4. 13. so <HI>Dan.</HI> 2. 19. To the same may suit that place of the Apostle, 2 <HI>Cor. 12. 1, 2. I will come to visions and re∣velations</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In hoc raptu a∣nima Pauli non erat a corpore separata, sed mens Pauli ita caelestia vidett ut esset a sensi∣bus corporeis a∣lienata.

His visions were not to the ocular part of his body, but to the in∣tellectuall part of his mind. His bo∣dily eyes might be shut, the eye of his understanding was open. Yea to his <HI>visions</HI> he adds <HI>revelations,</HI> which <HI>Theo∣phylact</HI> and others distinguish. The re∣sult<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conjungit Apo∣lus visiones &amp; revelationes quia quae vidit perfecte intel∣lexit. Estius in Loc. <HI>Carthus.</HI></NOTE> of all may be this: That as he saw by his understanding, so he did under∣stand what he saw; his intellect was so acting, though his bodily senses were bound. So that Apostle in <HI>Patmos,</HI> when he received those celestiall revelations, the <HI>vision</HI> he had (as a learned writer observes) was <HI>Interna, Imaginaria &amp; Intellectualis.</HI> His mind was in motion, his body lay as asleep, he is said to be <HI>in

<P>2. Since the <HI>Apostles</HI> God sometimes sent in Dreames of deep concernment as various and very good <HI>Authors</HI> evi∣dence. <HI>Jerome</HI> affirmes that <HI>Philo</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hyeronim.</HI> lib. de Viris illu∣stribus.</NOTE> <HI>Judaeus</HI> a famous man that flourished in the Emperour <HI>Caligulas</HI> time, some 40 years since <HI>Christ,</HI> that he wrote <HI>five Books</HI> of Dreames immitted of God. And <HI>Cyprian</HI> who lived under the Em∣perour <HI>Valerian</HI> about 260 yeares since Christ, reports, that in his time severall things were made known by Dreames, redounding much to the glory of God and the good of his Church. So <HI>Au∣gustine</HI> who was found famous in <HI>Africa</HI> between 4 and 500 yeares since <HI>Christ,</HI> wrote much relating to Dreames <HI>Di∣vine,</HI> and so it might be easily drawn down. <HI>Visions</HI> that use to be co-tem∣porary with <HI>Dreames</HI> have been in these

latter times. Inlarge I might easily out of <HI>Ecclesiasticall</HI> History, take on∣ly one instance. At a time there was in <HI>Antioch</HI> such a terrible earthquake as many houses fell flat, the people pos∣sessed with fear forsook the City, and with-drawing from their dwellings, <HI>one</HI> had a vision, that he saw a <HI>man</HI> coming to him, who bade him write upon every house, <HI>Christ is with us, stay here;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christus nobis∣cum, hic ma∣nete.</NOTE> which accordingly upon houses standing was written and so were pre∣served.</P>

<P>The making of <HI>Dreames</HI> lyeth in the moving of thoughts.

would passe with all speed; but mens hearts move heavy, and hence thoughts in some both awake and asleep are more slow.

God sends Angels from Heaven in the night and sets them a∣bout mens Beds when asleep; as to prevent Satan in Dreames that be bad, so to convey himself in Dreames very good.

When <HI>Satan</HI> by night with a sinfull fire brought from Hell would set mens souls on a flame; <HI>Angels</HI> bring a blessed fire from Heaven, that burns and heats mens hearts in holy Dreames. As <HI>God hath</HI> sent <HI>Angels</HI> to watch over some asleep, for their protection: so to work in some asleep, for their instruction. <HI>God</HI> hath appointed his <HI>Angels</HI> to carry his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 34. 7.

<P>1. God by Dreames hath signified to his Saints what afflictions they should suffer, that so they might the better prepare. History reports of <HI>Policarpus,</HI> who in <HI>Smyrna</HI> suffered martyrdome<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eusebius</HI> lib. 4. cap. 13.</NOTE> under <HI>Antonius</HI> the Emperour about a hundred seventy yeares after Christ, that three dayes before he fell into his enemies hands, sleeping upon his bed, he dreamt, that the bolster whereon his head lay, was all on a flame, and the other bed-cloaths burning about him; whereupon when he awoke, he told his friends, <HI>God</HI> had declared that he must be burnt quick for Christ (for which he much fitted himself) and so it soon fell out.</P>
<P>2. God by Dreames hath signified
<PB N="283" REF="173"/>
to his <HI>Saints,</HI> what mercies they should receive, that so he might strengthen their faith and also quicken their obedience. Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> in his journey lying down upon a stone to sleep, <HI>Gen. 28. 11, 12, 13. He Dreamed and behold a ladder set upon the earth and the top reached up to Heaven, and behold the Angells of God ascending and descending on it. And behold the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abra∣ham thy Father and the God of Isaac, the land whereon thou lyest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be bles∣sed. Behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places, whither thou goest, and will bring thee again to this land, and will not leave thee, till I have done what I have said.</HI></P>

</LIST>
<P>1. The imployment of Mens soules in such Dreames is high and holy. Mans soul we must observe, it sleeps not as the body does, for, as it lives when the body dyes: so it wakes when the body sleeps: 'Tis an <HI>Argument</HI> some bring to prove the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ne in somnium quidem anima cum corpore quo∣modo inveritatē mortis cadet, uqae inimaginem ejus ruit. <HI>Tert.</HI> de resur. carnis.</NOTE> that it does not die, as the body does, because it is not subject so much, as to the similitude or shadow of death; <HI>viz.</HI> sleep, as the body is; Now if not the soul of a man, much less does the <HI>soul</HI>
<PB N="285" REF="174"/>
of a Saint sleep: If the rationall <HI>soul</HI> be waking &amp; working, much more does the regenerate <HI>soul</HI> wake and worke, when the body is bound by sleep: And as the <HI>soul</HI> of a sinnefull Man is by bad Dreames set a worke in an abominable and wicked way: so the sanctifyed soul is in good Dreames set a work after an admirable and worthy way: we may say of the soul sanctifyed as 'tis said of the good<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corpore in lectu∣lo cubante ac velut in morte quiescente ipsa anima corporis naturam transi∣lit, <HI>&amp;c. Athan.</HI> Cont. Gent.</NOTE> house-wife, Prov. 31. 18. <HI>She perceives her merchandise is good and her candle goes not out by Night, she seeks wooll and flax and works willingly with her hands, she is like the Merchants ships, she bringeth her food from afarre, she riseth also while it is Night, and makes ready meat for her houshold, and prepares a portion for her Maidens,</HI> &amp;c. As while the drowzie <HI>Disciples</HI> were fast asleep, our dear <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> himself was hard at holy Prayer, fixed upon his <HI>Fathers</HI> will and work: so a Saint of <HI>God</HI> whilst his <HI>body</HI> lies a∣sleep on bed, his <HI>soul</HI> in a sweet Dreame is bent about blessed business, as if in prayer <HI>ardent,</HI> in hearing <HI>diligent,</HI> in Christian conference <HI>earnest,</HI> as if at the <HI>Lords</HI> Table instant, where he thinks
<PB N="286" REF="175"/>
he sees <HI>Gods</HI> Minister giving, precious people receiving, yea it seemes, as if he saw the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> thereat sitting, and thereupon the <HI>Spikenard</HI> smelling, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1. 12. Oh the rare workings of the soul at such a time, how admirably and accep∣tably did the soul of <HI>Solomon</HI> work in the time of a Dreame? what an excel∣lent prayer did he in the thoughts of his heart, make? 1 <HI>King.</HI> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9.</P>
<P>2. The Improvement of mens time in such Dreames is rare and precious. 'Tis a blessed thing for men to make the best of time, especially to raise that time towards their eternall good which others idly sleep away. We know a very vast part of our time runnes out by night and is spent in sleep, of which we must <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deorum im∣mortalium eti∣am noctes sunt, <HI>Hesiodus.</HI></NOTE> give an account, because not onely the day, but the night is Gods. <HI>The day</HI> (saies David to God) <HI>is thine, the night also is thine,</HI> Psal. 74. 16. <HI>Luther</HI> hath some such like saying. <HI>Whe∣ther</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sive nox est sive dies est, Dei sunt. Qui vigi∣lat, Domino vi∣gilat. Qui dor∣mit, Domino dor∣mit. <HI>Luther.</HI> Ex tomo. 3. In <HI>Genesim.</HI></NOTE> <HI>the time be night or day, it is of God, and ought to be to God. He that waketh must wake to God, and he that sleepeth must sleep to God.</HI> Now to God he surely sleeps, that thus surely Dreames.
<PB N="287" REF="175"/>
And as these meet times for man had never been: So time would not continue in its order; but day and night would be confounded, were it not for God. As <HI>God</HI> in the Creation did ordain day and night to be separate one from another, and successive one after ano∣ther, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 5, 6. So God by a Co∣venant keeps them asunder, to come in their season, <HI>Jer.</HI> 33. 20. 'Tis <HI>Gods</HI> mercy, day and night does not mingle together, as to marre their order. As <HI>God</HI> is worthy of praise, that preserves the night time: so it's praise-worthy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Non oportet eos qui animam vi∣gilantem intus habent tota nocte dormire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Clem. <HI>Alex.</HI> Paedag. <HI>l. 2. c. 9.</HI></NOTE> in man to improve the time of the night. Yea, that part of the night wherein he sleeps, so as when his body is at rest, his soule is at worke: when his body lies still, his soul is ascending <HI>Jacobs</HI> ladder. This is a marvellous <HI>mystery</HI> to the most of men.</P>
<P>2. Such Dreames are unto good men comodious,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Thereby the grace of God is evidently discerned, &amp;</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thereby the God of grace is comforta∣bly enjoyed.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. Through these a cleare discovery
<PB N="288" REF="176"/>
is made of the grace of God. <HI>Physicians</HI> find out the principall and most predo∣minant humours in the body by Dreames. <HI>Divines</HI> determine the <HI>ma∣ster,</HI> most prevailing and best beloved sinne in a man, by his Dreames. And so it may be surely seen and safely said, such and such graces are present and po∣tent in man by the spirituall motions of his minde in Dreames. God by Dreames hath unloosed the doubts and enlightned the darknesse of divers, brought them to the knowledge of what they did not understand. <HI>One</HI> hearing the praise of <HI>Basil,</HI> desired much to know what kinde of man he was, whereupon a pillar of fire was presented in a Dreame (saies my <HI>Author</HI>) with this motto, <HI>Talis est Basilius,</HI> such a one is <HI>Basil,</HI> a burning flame for God. Some of Gods Saints desirous to know the beauties of holinesse and to behold the lustre of grace, the Spirit of the Lord hath given that light in Dreames, that they have learned, how illustrious and lovely, grace and holinesse in their hearts hath been. <HI>Augustin</HI> tells of one <HI>Eulogi∣us</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August.</HI> de cu∣ra pro mortuis, <HI>cap. 10.</HI></NOTE> a Rhetorician in <HI>Carthage,</HI> who meet∣ing
<PB N="289" REF="176"/>
with an obscure place in <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Rhetoricks which he was next day to read to his <HI>Scholats;</HI> being at night troubled he could not understand it, fell asleep and by a Dream before morning, the dark place was made plaine. (How God hath cleared intricate▪ Scriptures this way to some, I shall forbeare to men∣tion:) And as obscure places in books, so obscure graces in hearts, have been admirably opened unto men in their Dreams, when they have been troubled with knotty objections, they have thus received resolutions; what was cloudy in the day hath been cleared in the night: Graces in the heart, like starres<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stellae in die la∣tent, in nocte lu∣cent. <HI>Bernard.</HI> in cam.</NOTE> in the heavens, have shined in the night that were not seen in the day. One writing of the twelve stones in <HI>Aarons</HI> garment, saies of the <HI>Rubic▪</HI> that it is a<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epiphanius</HI> de 12. Gem.</NOTE> precious stone soonest seen and best found out in the night, by a sparkling light it self therein casteth. Thus in the night may a man have experience of grace and the spirituall workings thereof that did not so appeare in the day.</P>
<P>2. In Dreames a close communion
<PB N="290" REF="177"/>
may be held with God; a man may have refreshing fellowship with <HI>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</HI> Many a good man, as in Dreames he hath had close combatings with <HI>Satan,</HI> his bed hath been as a field, wherein many a brave battle hath been fought and victory got gallantly, hath his soul beat off the <HI>De∣vill,</HI> when his body lay bound by sleep: So in Dreames he hath had close con∣versings with God, his <HI>Bed</HI> hath been as a <HI>Bethel,</HI> a place wherein <HI>God</HI> hath been present, and a place wherein he hath made neer approaches to God and God to him, <HI>Gen. 38. 16, 17. And Jacob</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Malè cubans suavitèr dor∣mit &amp; foeliciter Somniat.</NOTE> <HI>awaked out of sleep saying, surely the Lord is in this place. This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of Heaven.</HI> Why the place was the open field, where he had lien amongst the stones; ai but he had had such a Dreame, as put him into the very gate of Heaven, and placed him, as in the house of God. Hence a Saint may not onely say to <HI>God,</HI> as <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 139. 18. <HI>Lord, when I awake, I am still with thee, but Lord, when I sleep, I am still with thee!</HI> There may be somewhat more in that
<PB N="291" REF="177"/>
place of the Apostle, then we are aware of at present, 1 <HI>Thes. 5. 10. Christ di∣ed for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</HI> If it relates to <HI>sleep</HI> before mentioned, the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks of a double, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>A sleep of the Soul in security; <HI>Let not us sleep, as do others.</HI> ver. 6. &amp;.</P>
<P>A sleep of the body for necessity; <HI>They that sleep, sleep in the night,</HI> ver. 7.</P>
<P>Now that in the 10. <HI>ver.</HI> cannot be meant of the Soul sleeping in sinfull security; For therein is no living with Christ if intended of the body in it's na∣turall and necessary sleeping, then through holy Dreames a man lives with Christ. A godly man whether he wakes in the day, or sleeps in the night, by the thoughts of his mind he meets, <HI>Christ,</HI> remaines with Christ; Christ<NOTE PLACE="marg">O Sancta anima s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la esto ut soli omnium serves teipsum quem ex omnibus tibi ele∣gisti, an nescis te habere verecun∣dum sponsum? <HI>Bernard.</HI> lib. medit.</NOTE> and he hath sweet intercourse together!

All men, saies an <HI>obscure Wri∣ter,</HI> while they are awake, are together<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heraclitus.</NOTE> in one common world, but when they sleep, each man goes into a single world by himself. A Saint of God in his sleep goes into a glorious world where he finds comfortable company, conver∣ses with <HI>Angels, Apostles, Martyrs,</HI> and holy men. Thus <HI>God</HI> makes good that promise, <HI>Prov. 3. 24. When thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid.</HI> [That's not all] <HI>Yea thou shalt lye down and thy sleep shall be sweet;</HI> in sleep not onely free from what affrights, but filled with what refreshes.

A <HI>Persian</HI> Monarch Dreaming that <HI>Themistoles</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> a man of rare parts was revolted from the <HI>Greci∣ans</HI> and come in to him, being transport∣ed with joy, he broke out with a loud voice in his sleep, <HI>I have got Themisto∣cles</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Habeo Themi∣stoclem Atheni∣ensem. <HI>Xerxes.</HI></NOTE> <HI>the Athenian, He is mine, He is mine,</HI> wherewith he awaked, and so it was.

God in holy meditations. <HI>Com∣mune with your own heart upon your bed and be still,</HI> Psal. 4. 4. The bed is not barely for body-sleeping, but for heart∣communing and soul∣searching, <HI>Psal. 77. 6. In the night</HI> (saies David) <HI>I communed with my own heart, and my spirit made diligent search.

In the intervals or spaces between sleep and sleep to have the heart with God, to set our thoughts well a work, when at times we wake; Thus <HI>David,</HI> Psa. 65. 6. <HI>Lord, I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate upon thee in the night watches;</HI> Thoughts good when awake bring good thoughts in our sleep. 'Tis a sweet thing to lye in the night and me∣ditate upon the love of God and upon the Law of <HI>God.</HI> A young <HI>Scholar</HI> asking a <HI>Jewish Doctor</HI> if he might not have time to learn the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, he said, if he would do it neither by <HI>day</HI>

<P>2. We should <HI>relate</HI> things to o∣thers, and <HI>consult</HI> with <HI>Gods</HI> Saints hereupon. Thus to impart is to im∣print; and the way to drive Dreames in, is so to draw them out. <HI>When we keepe things from others, we oft loose them our selves.</HI></P>

</LIST>
<P>Hath God had good works in us, when asleep? Let us have good works for God, when awake. That good we Dreamt in the night, let us deed it in the day; draw it out in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acts to the utmost. Neither let us doubt, but he, who hath been good in the night, will be kind in the day! O saies <HI>David, The Lord will command his loving kindnesse in the day, in the night his song is with me,</HI> Psal. 42. 8. or [<HI>his song shall be</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Die praehet mihi bonitatem suam &amp; ita me exhi∣larat comtinuabit etiam noctu su∣um erga me a∣morem ut de eo laetari possim. <HI>Moller</HI> in lo∣cum.</NOTE> <HI>with me</HI>] This saying of the Psalmist, <HI>Mollerus</HI> expounds, as a certain continu∣ing of Gods comfortable kindnesse, in the night, being begunne in the day: So likewise an enlarging of Gods delight∣full love in the day, having found some sweet entrance thereof in the Night. As we may argue from Gods day∣kindnesse to his night-comforts: So upon the divine speculative comforts of
<PB N="302" REF="184"/>
the night, we may expect Gods accom∣plished kindnesse in the day.</P>
<P>Indeed the Dreames of worldly men about worldly matters vanish and pe∣rish, they do not find that comfort ful∣filled in the day, they fancied in the night. See how the Prophet compar∣eth some, <HI>Isa. 29. 6, 7. As when an hungry man Dreameth and behold he eat∣eth, but he awaketh and his soule is empty; or when a thirsty man Dreameth, and be∣hold he drinketh, but when he is awake, be∣hold he is faint;</HI> This place of the Pro∣phet, <HI>Calvin</HI> applies as to the <HI>Jews</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salse autem propheta Judaeos somniare dicit quia suis deliti∣is immersi vi∣dent &amp; senti∣unt subito ven∣turos hostes qui dormientibus terrorem incu∣tiunt <HI>Calvin</HI> in locum.</NOTE> who were so drowned in security and carnall delights that they Dreamed of nothing but prosperity and peace; but by and by a bloody Enemy cometh and dashing all, in the dust leaves them deso∣late.</P>
<P>They found no such reall matter to meet them as they fondly imagined. <HI>Diodate</HI> considers the place as to the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> who coming against <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Dreamed of great satisfactions, but the more they prospered in their successe, the lesse they were satisfied in their pur∣suits; All signifies, men may Dreame
<PB N="303" REF="184"/>
of those earthly honours, treasures, pleasures, which yet they never pos∣sesse, whereas spirituall mercies that good men imagine in their sleep, <HI>God</HI> may <HI>realize</HI> and make good when awake. Let a gracious man Dreame of the matters of <HI>God,</HI> converses with <HI>Christ,</HI> priviledges of the <HI>Gospel</HI> after <HI>which</HI> his <HI>Soul</HI> pants with a holy hunger and heavenly thirst; and afterward when awake, <HI>God</HI> gives him that <HI>really,</HI> which he did suppose in his sleep.

<LIST>
<ITEM>As our intermissions therein,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And our opposition thereto.</ITEM>

<P>1.

<P>2. Good <HI>examples</HI> of holy life, day∣ly laid before our eyes, may be a means to encrease good Dreames: viewed examples, and visible objects, have not onely an <HI>attractive,</HI> but an <HI>assimila∣tive</HI> power, to produce, and forme Phan∣tasms, and such imaginations as <HI>suite</HI> thereunto: O how the mind is ready to rise and runne thereupon! To look up∣on the lives of good men, to view their vertuous actions, and behold their holy conversations, is excellent. <HI>The more
<PB N="336" REF="201"/>
of those good visions we have in the day, the more we may have of these good Dreames in the night.</HI></P>
<P>4. Have we found good Dreames but few in times that are past, this should put us on the more for present and future, by desires, prayers and en∣deavours every night that comes, to cause our hearts to keep wakefull, that they may be the more vigilant and ob∣servant of God. God may often make overtures to us herein, and we take no notice thereof, <HI>God,</HI> saies Elihu, <HI>Job 33. speaks once, yea twice in a Dreame by night, and men perceive him not.</HI> When our bodies are asleep in our beds, grace may be asleep in our hearts, and our hearts asleep as to grace, and as unto God, so that we then regard him not. Many words by night <HI>God</HI> speaks, and many motions he makes, and we minde him not. Did but we seek to set our <HI>hearts</HI> into such an ever watchfull frame as is fit, we might in this manner finde more of God, and by night heare more of his minde, then ever we did. Wicked men can <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ʋt jugulent homines, sur∣gunt de nocte latrones: ut te∣ispum serves non expergisce∣ris. <HI>S. Horat, lib. 1.

their <HI>prey,</HI> and work with the <HI>Devill:</HI> and shall not we keep our minds alwaies awake for our <HI>profit,</HI> to watch for, and waite upon <HI>God,</HI> to meet him coming, to see his <HI>first step</HI> into our souls, and heare the <HI>first word</HI> he speaks to our hearts? As oft as we laydown our <HI>bodies</HI> to sleep, we should call up our <HI>hearts</HI> and minds, to awake, and attend Gods work; <HI>Awake Psaltery and Harp, I my self will awake right early.</HI> Though our hearts be abroad in the day, yet let them lodge with Christ at night.

<P>5. If yet for future, we find good Dreames but <HI>few,</HI> and meet with lit∣tle of <HI>Christ</HI> in our sleep, it must the more prompt and provoke us to walk the more with <HI>Christ,</HI> and work the more for God in the day, by the more plenti∣full practice of all pious duties. Did we know how pretious <HI>time</HI> is, and did<NOTE PLACE="marg">In tempore su∣mus &amp; quid tempus sit igno∣ramus.</NOTE> but we remember how much pretious <HI>time</HI> goes out in our sleep, and did but we consider how little of <HI>God</HI> is enjoy∣ed all that time, it might much move us the more largly to lay out the time of the <HI>day</HI> in all holy duties. Do we sleep out whole nights, and not heare one good word from <HI>God,</HI> nor of <HI>God</HI> have any one good thought? And shall we passe away, the <HI>day</HI> also, and Christ and our hearts, <HI>God</HI> and our minds scarse meet? Doe we lodge so much asunder in our sleep, O let us live the more together when awake? it may be blame-worthy, we have no more com∣munion with <HI>God</HI> in good Dreames.
