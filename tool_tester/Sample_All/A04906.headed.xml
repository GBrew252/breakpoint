made in returning to God from all such wickednesse, as doeth not onely infect the bodies, but also doeth distemper the soules of men. The due consideration whereof hath mooued many godly per∣sons to desire to be loosed out of the body of this life, for that they haue founde the same the stage of all sorowe, care and calamitie, for assoone as one misery and trouble is passed, an other commeth by &amp; by in place, and yet the first during to the dismaying of the afflicted, albeit such is the way that leadeth vnto Christ, to eate the bread and drinke the drinke of affliction. But suche doctrine may hardly bee indured of the worldlye minded: for mans repugnancie hath al∣wayes been such, as neither gods lawes nor publique authoritie, coulde euer keep the people in their due obedience: for the maintenance, and fensing in of Chri∣stian amitie, as the very boundes of peace. Insomuche as it is nowe a com∣mon speach, that the world is bad, which may not bee denied, and it followeth that the people are much worse, for it is true
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
that the worlde is the people. In whose conuersation if there might appeare a∣mendement, the worlde that now somuch is complained of, would soone be better. So as the liues of the people might bee framed thereunto accordingly: as nowe in time to winde vp the bāners y<SUP>t</SUP> solong haue bin displaied against God and his woorde, seeing that his Omnipotency is content through his mercy styll to of∣fer peace: which while wee doe seeme to contemne and set light by, God is pro∣uoked to high displeasure, (and the peo∣ple in a lamentable case) where their fro¦wardnesse is suche, as they doe rather choose to be obscured in darknes, then to walke in the brightnesse of the light. In the consideration whereof, it will in this small treatise appeare in what deformi∣ty and frowarde wayes, the most parte of the people in this age doe walke in. What returning God respecteth, what punishmente is threatned for sinne, and with what louing kindnesse God requi∣reth obedience vnto him, and his woord, extending his bountifull mercies vnto al those that in time will returne vnto him
<PB REF="8"/>
by amendment of life, and so to be made partakers of the benesites which hee so gratiously affereth: notwithstāding, the pride of man is suche, as that many can not abyde too haue their eares rubbed with such a medicine, but y<SUP>t</SUP> if the quicke be once touched, all the body will foorth∣with be out of frame, whereby GOD is mooued to displeasure, as it is euident by the sequell.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>¶ <HI>Against the vaine pri∣dings</HI> of men and women.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N howe outragious deformitie pride is grown vnto, it plain∣ly appereth by the strange behauiors of y<SUP>e</SUP> people in this our age. Insomuch as ma¦ny young men are become effeminate in respect of manhood: and the shamefast∣nesse which ought to be founde in young women, is in many become manly, in re∣spect of womanhood: insomuch as many yeeres past, who so had bin seene in such
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
strange attyre and apparrell, as nowe is worne by many young men and wo∣men, were iudged to be of a light conuer¦sation in liuing: but now there are many both men and women growne so far out of square, and are become so heauy in sin and wickednesse, as it is much to be fea∣red that when such shall come to be tryed in the ballaunce of good and euill, there wyll too many be founde much too light and the money which by many one so wastefully is consumed might be better imployed, then so to abuse it to theyr own harmes. Who ought not to be igno∣rant, that it hath byn an Adage in Eng∣lande That pride wyll haue a fal? which is to be feared may be so great, as much sorow may not counteruaile the woe, w<SUP>t</SUP> may happē thorow so great euils, as god forbid: for it cannot be denied, but that pride was the beginning of sin, for pride in the beginning of thinges did stir the creature against the Creator that four∣med and made him, The Angell against God: but God threw him downe from heauen: because he continued not in the trueth, he was first throwne frō the state of innocēcy into sin, &amp; frō sin into misery:
<PB REF="9" MS="y"/>
And he is nowe become the king of the children of pride, insomuche as the Pro∣phet <HI>Esay</HI> sayth thus much of his fall, <HI>O Lucifer which diddestrise in the morning,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 14. Apoc. 11.</NOTE> <HI>thou which diddest wounde all nations, art now fallē into the earth.</HI> Whose disci∣ples many one doe seeme to haue chosen to bee, not onely manifested by apparrell but also in summe theyr speaches ma∣ny doe declare of what religion they are of, when as in their daliaunce and plea∣dinges of loue matters, they seeme to ho∣nor the Saint whō they professe to shew. In such a lamentable sence, as God often times is much thereby dishonoured: and in such wyse as husbands raūging from their wiues, wiues from their husbands, maidens vnshamefast, and young men shamelesse.</P>
<P>For pride is alwayes desirous of new things, and the things w<SUP>t</SUP> any long time haue beene accustomed, that they accoūt wecrinesse, as to ocupie themselues in a∣ny Godly exercises. But this doctrine is so vngreeable vnto the children of pride, as it seemeth the most parte of the people haue so framed theyr faces to
<PB N="5" REF="9" MS="y"/>
looke God in the face moste impudently feeding theyr ownelicentious appetites with all newe fangled fantasies, in ma∣king the Sabboth day prophane, and a∣greeable to their own lustes and liking, with vigilant eyes, and attentiue eares, to vnderstande where and newe deuised folly or tidings is to be learned, whē as there can be no better tidings to reioyce in, then the glad tidinges of the Gospel. To the hearing wherof ma∣ny doe require discipline, to the ende too bring them into a better compasse of o∣bedience, whereas to spende theyr time in vaine delightes, there shall neede no such strickt order to mooue them therun∣to, as daily experience teacheth.</P>
<P>God graunt all suche a more considera∣tion of themselues, and a perfiter iudge∣ment of suche examples, as are left vnto vs by the saered woorde of God againste pride, and all other froward and wicked wayes. Whereunto ignoraunce may not bee pleaded, for that wyll not serue our turnes to excuse vs in the day of the Lordes visitation, as the examples are many, wherein it appeareth howe much God hath beene from the beginnig of∣fended
<PB REF="10"/>
by pride, Pride ouerthrewe the Tower of <HI>Babylon,</HI> Pride hanged vpp <HI>Haman,</HI> Pride was the destruction of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> Pride murdered <HI>Zenacherib,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 11. Mach. 15. Exod. 14. Reg. 18. 17.</NOTE> the king of <HI>Assyrians</HI> in the temple of his false God. Whereby it is manyfest that God hath not left pride vnpunished in the offendours: For sort is written in the Prophet <HI>Esay,</HI> The day of the Lorde of Hastes shall came vpon euery proude <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 23.</NOTE> and high minded man, and vppon euery arrogant person, and suche shalbe caste downe and be made lowe, and the stout∣nesse of the valiant and couragious shal∣be abated: Therefore hath Hell increa∣sed his power, and hath enlarged his mouth, and shall deuoure all the proude and vaine glorious persons.</P>
<P>The Lorde hath determined this to out of the pride of the insolent. As it is written by S. Luke, that the riche man that was clothed in purple and silk, was buried in Hell. <HI>Dina</HI> the daughter of <HI>Ia¦cob,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 34.</NOTE> before shee went foorth to buye orna∣mentes of forraigne women, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> writeth, continued her virginitie: but af∣terwardes <HI>Sichem</HI> sonne of the king of

As the ex∣amples of such are sundry, who for theyr <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dani. 13. Gen. 3.</NOTE> hyre haue receiued like rewarde, with the two wicked Elders, who falsly accu∣sed <HI>Susanna.</HI> Wherefore let neuer pride haue rule in thine heart, for in pride be∣gan al destruction.</P>
<P>Woe be vnto the proud wealthy in <HI>Si∣on,</HI> to such as thinke themselues sure vp∣on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos. 6.

Yee that drinke wine out of Goblettes, and annointe your selues with the beste Oyle, but no man is sorye for Iosephes hurte.</P>
<P>And in the Prophet <HI>Esay</HI> it is writ∣ten this <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and <HI>Iuda</HI> must decay, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 3.</NOTE> because both their woordes and councels are against the Lorde, to prouoke the presence of his maistie vnto anger, the changing of theyr countenaunce bewrai¦eth them: yea they declare theyr owne sinnes themselues, as the Sodomits did, and hyd them not.

Bid the righteous dowel, for they shall inioy the fruits of their studies: and woe vnto the vngodly and vnrighteous for they shalbe rewarded af¦ter theyr woorkes. And in the Pro∣phet <HI>Ezechiell</HI> it is written, Beholde the sinnes of <HI>Sodome</HI> were pride, fulnes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chapt. 16.</NOTE> of meate, abundaunce of idlenesse, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se thinges had shee and her daughters, be sides that, they reached not theyr handes to the poore and needy, but were proude, and did abhominable thinges before me: therefore I tooke them away, when I

had seene it, neither hath <HI>Samaria</HI> doone halfe the sinnes, yea thou hast exceeded them in wickednesse.</P>
<P>Moreouer thus saith the Lord, seeing the daughters of <HI>Sion</HI> are become so proude, and haue walked with stretched out neckes, and with vaine wanton eyes, seeing they come in so nicely tripping with theyr feete: Therefore shall the Lord shaue the heades of the daughters of <HI>Sion,</HI> and the Lorde shall discouer their shame.

At the last I made answere too my vision and saide, O Lord all these things be true indeede, what shall I doe to it? Then my vision made mee answere, and comforted me very much, and commaun∣ded mee too repaye all the Vsury money againe to euery man as hee had shewed me the summes which came vnto 18. hū∣dred pounds.

And as I finde of this one so re∣conciled to God, so I can not learne, but that as the number of such are very rare and contrary to many such as God hath suffered to perishe through that sinne as appeareth vnto what miserable end, the trade of Vsury brought manye Iewes who occupied the same trade in this lande in former ages, in suche wyse as it is affirmed in our chronicles.

great number of people traueiling from farre, to the ende to helpe the Lawyers in with their haruest, which is foure Termes or seasons of the yeare: duryng which tymes, many Lawyers are dili∣gent husbandes for them selues, in their attending and gathering of their priuate gaine. But howe stack many of them be, in dispatchyng of their Clyentes causes doeth manifestly appeare by the prolon∣ging of their sutes by all dilatory means: Insomuch as notwithstanding it is to be thought, that there is no Counseller at the lawe worthie so to bee allowed, but that vpon perfect instructions deliuered vnto him, hee is able to say or should say, of his learned knowledge, whether the case so put vnto him be in right and truth to be mainteined or not. But this <HI>Max∣ime</HI> with many is a <HI>Fallax</HI> in the law, for that the same is not agreeing with many of that profession. So to play the part of expert &amp; cunnyng Surgions, who soun∣ding the depth of their patients wounds, will foorthwith minister a speedie cu∣ryng salue: But rather too many haue
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
cunnyng to playe the parte of an yll conditioned Surgion, who hauyng soun∣ded his Patients griefe, and vpon tryall finding, that his Patient hath any store of hearbes in his Gardeine, straightway will apply a detractiue plaister thereby to trye their cunnyng, and so doeth prac∣tice the same so long as they finde theyr Pacient to haue any suche hearbes as will worke to their myndes. And in the meane tyme such beareth his poore Pa∣tient in hande, that his griefe had beene sooner cured, if some tyme one impedi∣ment, some tyme an other had not hynde∣red the cause in working, accordyng to the quilities and slintes of the lawe, tyll suche tyme as all his Patientes hearbes are spent, by the froward meanes of such Surgions, and many a man so left com∣fortlesse, and voide of hope of recouery of that which by good meanes might better haue beene holpen, or els not to haue beene taken in hande at all.</P>
<P>Notwithstandyng it is certayne, that
<PB REF="34"/>
hearbes doe worke much in curing, but the better if they be applied in their right nature and condition: in such sort as men can not vse the Surgions practise, with∣out much payne to be indured by his pa∣tient, especially if the Surgion bee indu∣rate of hart: So assuredly men can not goe to lawe one with an other with suche quietnesse of mynde, as it is by some sup∣posed. For proofe whereof, if men would examine in them selues howe difficult a thing it is, for Christian bretheren too spende their tyme in folowing lawe mat∣ters: It will easily appeare, that for the most parte, suche common posting to law as nowe a dayes is vsed, is not perfour∣med without greate greefe and vexati∣on of the mynde. As first either the par∣tie plaintiue or defendaunt, or both en∣ter not into sute without offence &amp; grudge of conscience. And nextly, their money in their purses will not bee at quiet tyll their proper owner bee eased thereof by Lawyers: although with the more paine if the Clyents are dwellyng farre from London, folowing oftentymes their own euill affections, as they are mooued tho∣rowe

the vayne passions of their mynds, leauing their more needefull affayres at home vndone, not onely to their owne harmes, but perhappes sometymes to the want of some of their pore wiues and children, in need of that which some fond husbandes doe so wastfully and wilfully consume in a desperate manner: without their more due consideration, what incon∣ueniences may growe vnto them selues, by feeding their vaine humours, in at∣tempting the lawe for euery friuolous matter, wherevpon action will lye, and oftentimes vpon no ground at all, stirring matters of contention where no cause is. As a strange case that sensible men shold delight to weary their bodies by trauey∣ling from farre: to the ende to departe from their goods in so ill cōdition, wher∣in truely the Lawyers are not so muche to be blamed in the attentiuenesse of their priuate gaine, as many fond Clyents by procuring their owne paine. For before the Lawyer was troubled with such Cli∣ents and their troublesome causes, and fraighted with their harde gotten mony, the Lawyer did sit, and perhaps might
<PB REF="35" MS="y"/>
sit quietly at his booke: and in the winter to call for a fyre to warme him: wheras nowe the ouer muche folly of many Cly∣ents hath and doeth maintayne the Law. yers to be both warme within &amp; abroad: whyle many harebraynde Clyents must tarry and attend without, hauing forgon that by their owne frailtie and wilfulnes, which woulde haue kepte them selues warme at home many a colde day, and eased them of many a paynefull iourney. For proofe thereof, my selfe haue learned by experience, included in these verses folowyng:</P>

<L>Who so that is forced the law to pursue,</L>

<P>Whereby it is to bee noted, the igno∣raunce wherein many doe shewe them selues to bee blynded, with the litle con∣fidence
<PB N="30" REF="35" MS="y"/>
which one neyghbour seemeth to haue in an other. In so much as I haue thought both my selfe and many others deceiued in that behalfe, who settyng a parte the trust of affiaunce, which ought to bee reposed in honest &amp; discreet neigh∣bours, haue obstinately throwne them selues into great charges, with the dis∣commodittes before rehearsed. Albeit, dayly experience teacheth, that after long and tedious sute mainteined, the ende of all issues growe to one of these two poyntes, that eyther the parties are per∣suaded by, friendes, or by their Lawyers to put the matter in comprimyse, or els the nature of the lawe doeth award a Iu∣ry of twelue men to trye the issue, in such wyse as perhappes no one of the sayde twelue are knowne, neyther vnto par∣tye playntyue, or defendaunt: or if to the one, yet not to the other. Wherevpon I deeme this old adage dyd grow, That as a man is befriended, so is the law en∣ded. So as often tymes it falleth out, that those carrye awaye the blowes, who leaste distrusted theyr cause: farre
<PB REF="36"/>
contrary to their expectations: In suche sort, as were it not much better that such vnskilfull persons had neuer hazarded them selues in the fray. As often the mat∣ter doeth hang a yeare or two doubtfull, in whom the victory shal rest: and yet in the ende one worde may bee so taken at the vantage, as the spending of many a pounde may not cure the wounde made thereby.</P>
<P>And by such means the boūds of christiā amitie is much impaired. In so much as Christian loue and neighbourhead ap∣peareth to be very cold, where the people may not be perswaded so to frame thē selues, as to commyt their common cau∣ses of controuersie, to the hearing and de∣ciding of the worshipful Gentlemen nere vnto them adioyning, or vnto their honest discreete neighbours. For it is very vn∣lyke that a stranger who dwelleth farre distant from vs, and altogether ignorant of our dispositiōs and conuersations, shold sooner prouide a redemie thē our knowen neighbours, and suche as wee are daily conuersant with all: and vnto whom our inclinations &amp; maners of liuing is better

knowne.</P>
<P>As also no sensible man ought to bee ignorant, that honest neighbors wil hold themselues more thankfully content with one friendly intertainmēt after their tra∣uayles vsed in such behalf, then the Law∣yers will accompt of their many fees. But me thinketh, I heare some say, mine aduersary dwelleth farre distaunt from mee: vnto whom I answere, not so. But that if thou accompt anye thy Christian brethren for thine aduersary, then take heede of thy Aduersary the Deuill, for he is nearer vnto thee then thou art aware off: And appeareth not to be farre from suche, as haue chosen to dwell in malice and grudge of conscience many yeares, yea, perhappes to their ending day.</P>
<P>And againe me thinkes I heare some say, that my neighbors vpon some grudge may be corrupted, which I can not deny: But then it must needes folowe, that the people are very euill disposed, and in a badde case, where corruption may so take place in the hearts of such as professe the name of God: that so many may not bee founde to speake in true iudgement be∣twixt

<P>And agayne it is written in the same Chapter: God is loue, and hee that dwel∣leth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is y<SUP>e</SUP> loue perfect in vs, that wee haue trust in the daye of iudgement: for as be is, euen so are we in this world.

<P>Wee loue him for hee loued vs first: if

<P>By which doctrine all Christians are willed to auoyde so great threatenynges from God: and hereby wee learne, that no man can keepe his hands cleane from deceites and bribes, except he first washe away the couetous desires from his hart, and so shal we obtayne a true iudgement: In so muche that where the people haue no feelyng desire in them selues of suche iudgement, let them thē beware of Chri∣stes iudgement, and learne in tyme to be more carefull howe to frame them selues towardes God and their neighbour, both in heart and tongue.</P>

<P>And to the ende that no man shoulde so flatter him selfe, as to say, that God is no such seuere Iudge, let euery one take vnto him self the ensample of the ten vir∣gins spoken of in the Gospell, of whome <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE> fiue were so negligent, as hauing no oyle in their Lampes, whereby to haue ente∣red in with the Bridegroome, who pas∣sing by, and findyng fyue of them so vn∣prouided, as that they were excluded their entering in with the bridegroome, when as the other fiue wyse, entered in with ioy, hauing oyle in their vessels, and lightes in their Lampes, and were made partakers of the promised reward, wher∣as the other fiue were sequestred from the benifit therof: as vnto them reckoned for folishnesse by reason of the sodain cōming of the Bridegroome.

Which ignorance of those foolishe could not excuse nor auayle thē in saying would to God we had done as the other did, for they came too late, and the gate was put too. But mee thinkes I heare some say, that it concerneth not mee to haue taken in hande the handelyng of so weightie causes: vnto whome I answere this, Ad∣myt, that any one would say, that saluati∣on belonged not vnto mee, should I yelde therevnto: No God forbyd: for although I am no Publike Minister, yet am I a publyke Christian. Although some light disposed persons will not let to say thus, by any whome they perceiue to be godly and better disposed then them selues, Lo he is touched and sauoureth of the spirit, but we are of the worlde, and must lyue after the manner of the worlde, To such I say, that this worlds prouisions and ac∣tions, must so bee tempered with vertue and godlinesse: as that the one be not di∣stempered by the ouer muche follye com∣mitted in the prosecuting of the other, for
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
there is godly sorowe, and a worldly so∣rowe: and two contraryes may not well agree to be ioyned together. No manne <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 6.</NOTE> can serue two masters. No man can serue God and Baall. By which reasons all those that doe professe to loue God, shold hate and shunne all things, that are con∣trary to his diuine will and pleasure: for God is of power to make frustrate what soeuer is repugnant to his will. But this doctrine seemeth to be separated so farre from the most of the people in this age: As it appeareth, that when God doeth touch many with bodily sickenesse, losse of goods or friendes, howe carefull euery one sheweth him selfe, euen very pensiue and heauy. And yet how light seemeth to be set by many greeuous and loathsome diseases of the soule, daily experience tea∣cheth. In so muche as where it is vsed in Londō, in tyme of Gods visitation of the plague, to shutte vp the doores and wyn∣dowes, as a necessary meanes to keepe the infection of the sicke from the sounde: euen so assuredly it is a most needful rule, and the best preseruatiue agaynste the plague that can be vsed, that euery hous∣holder

The sin &amp; wickednes that doth abounde, wherewith not onely the people, but also sometyme the very ayre is infected, with the iniquitie that can by no meanes bee kept downe, but will needes breake forth lyke a flaming fire. Although all people ought to knowe and remember, that the same God that is of power to send health and sicknesse, wealth, and pouertie, doeth commaund all men to flee and auoid sin, and to lyue after his commaundements, as a perfect rule or direction: which God graunt may in time, woorke such effect, that sinne and wickednesse may so be ba∣nished, not onely out of London, but also out of all partes whereas God is pro∣fessed, as that his name may be truely glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d</P>

To try all whereof let
<PB REF="43"/>
it be noted how euery company of good Bees being seperated from their hiues in gathering of their prouision far from home, who vpon their seuerall returnes againe, no one will couet any other hyue but their owne proper, and that which is incident vnto them selues, neyther should be suffered if they would, for that by na∣ture as it shoulde seeme, euery company of Bees doeth so holde together, in suche wyse, as euery one of them doeth in the wynter possesse the fruite of their paine∣full labour gathered in the somer. Being perfourmed by equall labour not with∣out daunger to bee crossed in their tra∣uayle, some tyme by one meanes, some tymes by an other. In so muche as it appereth in the felowship of good Bees, that the want of the out, is not the pros∣peritie of the other: And that it seemeth that their prouision is gathered by them with an indifferent care.

perfourmaunce whereof, the good wil of each one, seemeth to be well allowed, not onely to the comfort of their own felow∣shyp, but also to euery common wealth, whereas they are setled and cherished, declaryng thē selues so worthie to bee ac∣counted of, cōtrary to Wapses, not with∣out euil stinges in the gathering of their badde prouision: And that often tymes doeth appeare by the shrewde harme and damage that many an honest man doeth sustayne by dealyng with suche vnprofi∣table cattayle: whose seperation is, not onely required from among good Bees, but also their company from among mē. Neuerthelesse many of that sort woulde be thought and reputed as good and pro∣fitable Bees, although no honest bare faced man can well away to haue to doe with that sort. From whome it may bee thought that many people in this age haue taken ensample, to deale shrewde∣lye and vniustly with their neyghbours, as dayly experience teacheth. In so∣muche as it was a common saying a∣monge the people not longe sithens, that where any one intended to do dammage

to any other their Christian brethren or neighbours, it was speeched in a barba∣rous manner thus: I warrant you to bee ouertaken with a crooked measure, by ha∣uyng to doe with suche a one: which God knoweth appereth yet to be too too truly perfourmed by the cōmon practise there∣of, contrary to this one good insample. For the true measuring of corne in all in∣corporate Cities and Townes in Eng∣lande, where the true measure is well knowne to be fastened in a certaine place neare vnto the market, where as euery one may at their pleasures, haue the true vse thereof, and not denyed to any: which notwithstanding, the greatest number of the people in their common buiyng and sellyng, doe seeme to haue set a parte to deale in true measure, as hardly to bee persuaded to take so litle paynes as once to steppe ouer the way, or to their nexte neyghbours doore, to the ende to speake or deale in trueth and true measure, by reason that the crooked measure is euery where so readie. As often tymes it falleth out too true, that many a true meanyng man is ouertaken, &amp; some tymes vndone
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
by suche lyke euill crooked &amp; deceiueable meanes, and yet the Lorde hath sayde, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 3</NOTE> that all crooked thinges shall bee made straight, &amp; all rough wayes shalbe made playne, and all fleshe shall see the saluati∣on of their God.</P>
<P>And although all men can say, playne <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chapmen or retaylers of wares.</NOTE> meanyng and playne dealyng is best, as in very deede and in trueth none can deny it, so fewe doe folow it. As when any Re∣taylors, or chapman of wares, doe buy at the Merchauntes handes to sell againe. Then suche can say, it is naught it is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pron. 20.</NOTE> naught, but whē he hath it, he doth praise the same, and that in such deformed wyse, as that many in doublyng the falshoode of their tongues, forbeare not to sweare in a deceiueable manner, that it cost them thus muche, and that they may not aford it vnder thus muche: when as in deede, suche their buying and sellyng tendeth to deceit: In so much as when some of them haue beene reprooued for takyng Gods name in vayne, some such there haue byn so impudent as in defence of their euyll doyng, haue answeared, that in tyme of their swearyng they haue deteyned their

thoughtes in their heartes. Although all such ought not to be ignoraunt that God is a searcher of the heartes and raynes. But what may be sayde then to such hor∣rible monsters, for I may not terme them men: If there be suche as I haue hearde to be, who will not let to sweare vpon a booke, and that before any Iudge, beyng hyred therevnto for money. And such are called by the names of Knightes of the poste, more fitter for the Gallowes, then to liue in a common wealth where Christ is professed. For by suche wicked &amp; dam∣nable meanes, truth is oftentimes put to silence, and the lawe is subuerted contra∣ry to this doctrine, that who so listeth to liue, and would faine see good dayes, let him refraine his tongue from euil, &amp; his lippes that they speake no guile. But it may well be, that we in this age do draw neerer vnto Gods iudgementes: which the rather doeth appeare, when in euery ones mouth, yea by the youth euery wher it is now a cōmon speach intaking Gods name in vaine, for euery trifling thing, when it is said, as Christ shal helpe mee, and as Christ shall iudge me, in suche de∣formed

<P>Dearly beloued, be not ignorāt of this

one thing, howe that one day is with the Lorde as a thousand yeares, and a thou∣sand yeares as one day. The Lorde that hath promised is not slacke, as some men count slacknesse: but is patient to vsward. Forasmuch as he wold haue no man lost, but will receiue all men to repentaunce. Neuerthelesse, the day of the Lorde will come as a theefe in the night, in the which day, the heauens shall passe away in ma∣ner of a tempest, and the Elements shal melt with heate: the earth also and the workes that are therin, shall burne. See∣yng then that all these thinges shal perish what manner persons ought yee to bee in holy conuersation and godlines: looking for, and hastyng vnto the comming of the day of God, by whome the heauens shall perishe with fyre, and the Elements shal melte with heate. Neuerthelesse, wee ac∣cordyng to his promise, looke for a newe heauen and a newe earth, wherein dwel∣leth righteousnesse. Wherefore dearely beloued, seeyng that yee looke for suche thinges, be diligent that ye may be found in peace without spotte and vndefiled, and suppose that the long suffring of the Lord
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
is saluation.</P>
<P>By this doctrine euery Christian ought not to be ignorant howe there is a great differēce betwixt y<SUP>e</SUP> record of God and the witnesse of men, &amp; that euery one should so growe in grace &amp; knowledge of our Lord and sauiour Iesus Christ: As that we be not plucked away thorow the errour of the wicked. In respect wherof to the ende that all men may haue a due consideration what manner of dealing God alloweth among his people in their buiyng and selling, I haue here set down such certaine notes as the worde of God doeth direct vs vnto.</P>
<P>When thou sellest aught to thy neigh∣bour or buiest any thing of him, deceiue <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 25.</NOTE> nor oppresse him not.</P>
<P>Deale not wrongfully with thy neigh∣bour, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leui. 19.</NOTE> with meateyeard, weight nor mea∣sure.</P>
<P>A false Ballance is an abomination <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 11.</NOTE> vnto thy Lord God. Moreouer thou shalt not haue in thy bagge twoo manner of weightes, a great and a small: neyther shalt thou haue in thy house two manner of measures a great and a smal. That thy
<PB REF="47" MS="y"/>
lyfe may be long in the lande which the Lorde thy God giueth thee: for who so doeth contrary, is an abhomination vnto the Lord God.</P>
<P>Haue therefore a regarde vnto this doctrine, lest that God beholdyng your misoemeanour towardes him and your neighbour, say this vnto you, These peo∣ple drawe vnto mee with their mouthes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 15.</NOTE> and honour mee with their lippes, how∣beit their heartes are farre from me: but in vaine doe they serue me.</P>
<P>Moreouer it is written, if any man a∣mong you seeme deuout, and refraine not his tongue, but do deceiue his own heart: this mans deuotion is in vaine.</P>
<P>By which doctrine wee are learned, that the eyes of the lord are ouer the righ∣teous, &amp; his eares are open to their pray∣ers: and the face of the Lorde beholdeth all those which doe euill and wrong. Wherby it is to be noted, in what dread men doe sometime stand in of their supe∣riors, lest that for some contempt or diso∣bedience, the transgressours are subiecte to be sent to ward, in such wise as in such cases men doe seeme to bee very circum∣spect. And yet a great number, thorowe
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
their neglecting their duetie &amp; obedience to God, do vnto him stande subiect euery houre, to be cast into a woful prisō: where it will be too late for such to say, I would other my friends were warned by mee. For then that may neither auayle thee, nor amend them. As wee finde it written: That when <HI>Diues</HI> desired that his other <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 16.</NOTE> brethrē might haue knowledge of his tor∣ments: It was answered him: They haue Moyses, the law, and the Prophets.</P>
<P>By which ensample all people are ad∣monished, y<SUP>t</SUP> in this lyfe while they haue time &amp; space euery one both men and wo∣men, to do nothing against a good consci∣ence, and to examine in them selues, how they doe delight to lyue in the feare of God, and by their innocency of lyfe, doe indeuour them selues to obtayne Gods fauour, and so to be brought into the fold mētioned in S. <HI>Iohn.</HI> Wherin it is noted, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 10.</NOTE> how the sheepe of Christ are marked: and w<SUP>t</SUP> what seales they are sealed against the day of the Lorde: By which parcell of scripture, Christ doeth acknowledge his: In that hee sayeth, My sheepe heare my voyce, I knowe them,
<PB REF="48"/>
and they followe mee, and I giue vnto them eternall lyfe, which is to bee obtay∣ned by earnest repentance, and mortifling of our earthly members, framyng our felues to bee obedient vnto the voyce of that good shepheard of our soules. See∣ing wee feede all in one greene pasture vnder so good a shephearde nexte vnder God: as our gratious Queene, of whom rightly it may bee registred in <HI>perpetuū,</HI> That by the permission of God &amp; his pro∣tection, her Maiestie hath raigned the peaceable Queene and shephearde ouer the litle shepcoate of the people of Eng∣land. Wherefore it behooueth the people to be as simple as sheepe, &amp; in their yel∣ding lyke due obedience to God, and our so blessed a gouernesse, &amp; not to set light by the callyng of the Pastors, who watch for our soules euen as those that muste giue account therefore, and vnto such we owe a duetifull reuerence, especially if they be suche Pastors and Ministers as are required in so weightie a businesse: and whatsoeuer the Minister be, be hee good or badde, whose conuersation if we will needes looke vpon, yet wee must so
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
looke, that our looking be rightly. And although we are forbidden to do as some of them doe: yet we are not forbidden to folowe the doctrine which by them is de∣liuered vnto vs, out of the worde of God. And to trye whether our followyng bee rightly, and howe wee doe profite euery mā in the course of this our pilgrimage, Let vs examine it by these twoo rules. First, as husbandment can make no perfit reckoning of his painefull labour &amp; tra∣uayle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The meanes wherby eche man may era∣min in himselfe how he grow∣eth rich to god∣ward.</NOTE> nor of the increase of his seed sow en in the ground, vntill he haue had some certaine tryall of the yeelde which often∣tymes is hindered in the commyng vpp, in so much, as although it haue a prospe∣rous tyme, first in growyng greene and pleasant to looke vppon, which notwith∣standing it is apparant, that in that sea∣son may happen great imperfection, as to be choked with weedes or blasted. And albeit, it grow to a more forwardnesse to earyng, yet it is seene oftentymes that a tempest commeth and beateth it downe. And if there remayne a hope of plentifull increase, yet the same is not certainely knowne, howe much it will profit the hus∣vandman,
<PB REF="49"/>
vntyll it bee housed in the barne.</P>
<P>And againe as the Merchant aduen∣turer can not perfite their accomptes be∣fore the dangerous aduentures be retur∣ned in safetie, to their wished and desired port: So as after their merchandise and commodities beeyng vended, then fall they to casting and Ballaunsing of their recconings. Vpon the examinatiō wher∣of, they doe discerne, what and how much they haue profited or lost in their voiage or aduenture: and if they finde that they are brought behynde hand, and fall short of their recconing, then they examine the cause, which beyng founde, they become more carefull in their; next aduenturing. An suche wyse, as by their diligence, and God his blessyng of their trauayles, in so good cōditiō, as their former losses often∣tyme is restored againe with double in∣crease, to their great comfort and the dis∣couraging of all suche as doe fraudently deceiue or wastfully cōsume their goods, and so become bankerupt.</P>
<P>These examples I woulde wishe all
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
men to imitate, by examinyng euery one in him selfe, howe they doe growe riche in the perfityng of their accompt to God warde. Although it is apparaunt that there are some men which waxe riche o∣therwyse, who shewe them selues not to knowe what it is to heare the Lord God speakyng to them by his Prophets: and in this our age deliuered vnto them by the mouthes of many learned and godly Preachers, whose callyng if they may not be heard and receiued, accordyng as it is written in the Reuelation. Hee that hath eares let him heare, That is to heare rightly, and with ioy, and to expresse the fruite thereof in a lyfe agreeable to the same, which if riche men doe refuse to practise, then let it be examined how, and what such and their posteritie shall be the better for riches vnlawfully gotten: see∣ing that the more they haue, the more they want. And that which they haue so gotten and scraped together, shel one day bee a witnesse against them. For it is true, that although wee haue here many dayes, God shall haue one day. As the
<PB REF="50"/>
worde of God testifieth, That the day of the Lorde shall come vpon all fleshe. And as it is written in the Gospell of Saint Marke. Except that the Lorde shoulde shorten those dayes, no man should be sa∣ued: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. 13.</NOTE> but for the elects sake which he hath chosen, he hath shortened those dayes. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Moreouer it is written in the same Chapter, Thus saith the Lord. Til these thinges be done, heauen and earth shall passe, but my wordes shal not passe. But of the day &amp; the houre knoweth no man: No not the Angels which are in heauen, neither the sonne of man him selfe, saue the father onely. Take heede, watch and pray, for ye knowe not when the time is. As a man which is gone into a straunge countrey, and hath left his house, &amp; giuen authoritie to his seruauntes, and to euery one his work, and commaunded the Por∣ter to watch: watch therfore, for ye know not when the maister of the house will come, whether at euen or midnight, whe∣ther at the Cocke crowing, or in the daw∣nyng: Lest if he come sodainly, he should sinde you sleeping.</P>
<P>And that I say vnto you, I say vnto
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
all men, watch and pray.</P>
<P>The due consideration of this doctrine hath mooued many good and godly men to become stedfast in the faith of Christ, as the best meanes to the attainement of saluation. But this fayth that is requy∣red, must be no idle fayth: for a perfecte <NOTE PLACE="marg">Faith is of a forcible effect. and the stay of our life.</NOTE> fayth is as a consumyng fyre to burne vp all infidelitie, sinne, and wickednes.</P>

<P>As testifieth these necessary places of scriptures. Thou hast fayth, and I haue deedes: shew me thy fayth by thy deeds: belieuest thou that there is one God? thou doest well: The Deuils also beleeue and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames. 2.</NOTE> tremble.</P>
<P>If a brother or a sister be naked, and be destitute of daily foode, and one of you say vnto him, depart in peace: God send you warmenesse and clothing. Notwith∣standyng, ye giue them not those things that are needfull to the body, what shal it

<P>By this part of Scripture it appea∣reth how some men haue grown in welth and yet doe contrarie to Gods liking, which notwithstanding it is manifest that many rich Farmers and Grasiers haue peruerted the way of such as God requireth, and as themselues ought to be. For it is true that with many of them, all is too little to the inlarging of their borders, as though they would liue alone vpon the earth: Insomuch as some one of that profession haue incroched into his handes the occupation of two or three Farmes mainteyning hardly therevp∣on so many persons as any one of those Farmes mainteyned before tyme, when as they were occupied by seuerall house∣holders, in such wise as many seruiceable men were thereuppon mainteyned in fewe yeeres past beeing nowe supplied with a shepheard and his dogge, wherin many haue founde so great gaine to the increasing of their deceiuable wealth, by

By meanes wherof, Christ his religion hath bene greeuously hindered, as it is euidēt by one notable ensample as hereafter fo∣loweth.</P>
<P>Sometyme there was a great Turke <NOTE PLACE="marg">An ensample of a great Turke.</NOTE> whose name was called <HI>Soldanus Egypti.</HI> who was touched with the consideration of the profession of Christ his religion: as that he was mooued and stirred in mynd, to haue forsaken his abominable errour

and become a Christian: So as he might bee ascertayned that the lyues of Christi∣ans were agreeable to their profession. Wherevpon in the consideration of his intention, after hee had long pondered with him selfe howe hee might best bee resolued in so weightie a cause, he deter∣mined to breake the matter vnto one nere about him, in whome hee had most confi∣dence, and vnto him the said great Turke declared the some of his intention, and findyng his trustie friende readye to ac∣complishe his request: who secretly was furnished about that busines: So that in short time he arriued in some parts of I∣taly, as a part of Christendom: to the end there to discouer the maners and behaui∣ours of the people, where bee founde the maner of their liuyng, so farre vnagree∣able to the professiō of the names of Chri∣stians, as the saide messenger of the.

So as hee hauing attayned the effect of his message which hee had giuen in charge, he returned again from whence hee came, and made relation vnto his

master the great Turk in this wise. True it is, that those people where I haue byn in Christendome, &amp; that beare the names of Christians, doe in their outwarde ap∣pearaunce professe to serue a Godwhom they knowe note, and otherwise theyr lyues in deedes, are distayned with all abominable loathsome sinne and wye∣kednesse. Whereuppon the sayd great Turke hauyng taken some pause, brake out in these speeches or the lyke. And is it so, then I decest and defie them and theyr religion. In suche odeous and reprochfull wyse as may bee an ensam∣ple to all partes of Christendome, where as Christ is professed in words, and con∣temned in deedes. In so much as we are to praye to GOD to keepe the Turkes spyes out of this parte of Christendome, vntyll a more vnifourme order of liuyng may bee founde ioyned with our profes∣sion, in suche godlye conuersation, as that Englande especially maye become a Lanterne to other our neyghbours, who haue not as yet so large measure of Gods louyng kyndnesse, as it hath

And that the ene∣myes spyes may haue no iuste cause to vse any suche manner of reproouyng the people of Englande. But that euerye one of the congregation, maye be stirred to frame theyr lyues in godly conuersa∣tion, and not to delyght to take ensam∣ple of euill doyng: but rather to be doing that which is good, and to edifie with all.

For it is writ∣ten, if one of thy brethren among you bee <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 15.</NOTE> poore within any of thy gates in the land which the Lorde thy God giueth thee.

<P>If thy brother an <HI>Ebrew</HI> sell him selfe vnto thee, or an <HI>Ebruesse,</HI> and serue thee sixe yeares, the seuenth yeare thou shalt let him goe free from thee, &amp; when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away emptie: but shal giue him of thy sheepe, of thy corne, and of thy wyne: and giue him of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee. And remember that thou wast a seruant in the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> &amp; the Lord thy God deliue∣red thee thence, and therefore this thyng I commaund thee this day:</P>
<P>And the same God hath commaun∣ded children to doe their dueties with di∣ligence, As it is written in Saint <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Ephesiās,</HI> in his first Epistle: Chil∣dren <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ephe.</HI> 6.

<P>For with God there is no respecte of persons. And to the ende that euery one in generall, both men and women, should haue a due consideration of the benifites done vnto mankinde in his first creation.

our beholding the Heauers, with the or∣namentes thereof. Where the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres, doe all ob∣serue their course in due order, to the end to put all mankynde in remembraunce of our obedience wherevnto wee were fra∣med in our first creation: which benifite of creation, as it was and is denied to all other creatures besides: who as they are voyde of reason, whereof and wherefore they were made and created. So do they take their turnes in commyng vppon the earth, and passyng agayne without any further memory to be had of any of them. But man ought not to be ignoraunt, that seeyng almightie God hath dealt so boū∣tifully with him, as to make him Lorde ouer all other creatures in obeying him: So is man him selfe bounde to the more strickter fourme of obedience vnto God, for so many and sundry his benefites re∣ceiued: whereby all mankynde is admo∣nished, that forasmuch as all other things are ordeyned for the necessitie and vse o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man: so should man be more carefull for the thinges apperteyning to the hunge∣ring of our sinfull soules: then for the fee∣dyng

<P>And thervpon Christ in his rebuking <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 23.</NOTE> the Scribes and Pharisies, sayeth thus, Woe be vnto you yee Hypocrites, for ye make clean the outward side of the cup &amp; of the platter, but within they are full of brybery and excesse. Thou blinde Pha∣risie clense first that within the cuppe and platter, that the outside of them may bee cleare also. Wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharisies, ye Hypocrites, for ye are like vnto paynted Sepulchers, which indeed appeare beautifull outwarde, but within are full of dead mens bones, and of all filthinesse.</P>
<P>Euen so are there many in this age, who do seeme outwardly to be righteous
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
and so would bee reputed and taken: but within are full of all fainednesse and ini∣quitie.</P>
<P>Vpon such lyke occasion, S. Peter in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pet. 2.</NOTE> his first Epistle sayth, Wherfore laye a∣side all maliciousnesse, guile, &amp; dissimula∣tion, enuy, and all backbityng, &amp; as newe borne babes desire that reasonable milke which is without corruption, that ye may growe therein: if so be that ye haue tasted howe pleasant the Lord is, to whome yee come as a liuyng stone disallowed of mē, but chosen of God, and precious: but ye as liuyng stones, are made a spirituall house: and an holy priesthood for to offer vp spirituall sacrifice acceptable to God by Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>As it is testified in the scripture, Be∣holde I put in <HI>Sion</HI> an head cornet stone, elect and precious: and he that beleeueth on him, shall not bee ashamed: vnto you therefore which beleeue, hee is precious, but vnto them which beleeue not, the stone which the builders refused, the same is made the heade stone in the cor∣ner: and a stone to stumble at, and a rocke to offende them which stumble
<PB REF="68"/>
at the worde, and beleeue not that, where∣on they were set.</P>
<P>Wherefore to the ende that wee may <NOTE PLACE="marg">The reedifiyng of London Bridge, com∣pared to the building and reedefiyng of the house of God.</NOTE> examine in our selues howe euery one is framed agreeable to Gods good plea∣sure, against the day of his visitation, I haue here thought good to set downe the maner of the reedifiyng of the new Arch of London Bridge. Wherein may be no∣ted the differēce be twixt a priuate work, and a work for a commonaltie &amp; commo∣ditie of the people in generall. The ma∣ner of the proceeding in the saide worke. First, the olde frame of building was ta∣ken downe to the grounde, which to most mens iudgemēts, as trauellers by, wold haue iudged the foresaid olde building of sufficiencie to haue continued the charge which the same had before supplyed of long tyme: wherevpon diligent searche was made, and the grounde woorke was founde so imperfected, by reason of the sundrye imperfections that were founde therein. In so muche as it was thought needefull by those that had the ouer sight thereof, that the foresaide olde building shoulde bee taken downe as it was, for a∣uoyding
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
of further danger: hauing a re∣spect vnto the time of the yeare, when the visiters and founders dyd take the same in hande. In so muche as all the olde de∣faulted buildyng beyng rydde out of the way, and expert workemen beeyng come to searching of the foundation, they found the olde pyles whereon the stone worke stood in so euil cōditiō, as it was thought most needful that many should be displa∣ced out of their seates, which appeared not to be done without paynefull labour. And beyng brought to passe, new Pyles of the perfectest wood that could be pro∣uided was ordeyned and set in the seate and places of the old. For the better per∣fourmance wherof, euery pyle so set, was not don without like tedious labour, cue∣rye one beeyng armed and calked with Iron. To the ende to make their way the perfecter: So to withstande any impe∣dimentes which myght haue hindered their enterance: which was perfourmed in as hard a maner as if the same had bin a newe forceable worke. For by reason of continuance the olde grounde worke was loth to yelde. Albeit, that nowe by
<PB REF="69"/>
the perfect experience of cunning work∣men, there is placed vpon the well groun∣ded foundatiō of Pyles, a durable stone∣woorke to the defence of all stormy tem∣pests: so workmanly handled as one stone is fastened to an other in their ioynyng together with Iron catches, thereby to keepe them from startyng out of their of∣fices, beeyng pointed in the ioyntes with Sowder, Rozen, Tallow, and Pitch, as a compound of forceable effect, needfull about such a worke, to the ende that no impedunent should growe or enter in be∣tweene the ioyntes, beyng preuented by suche good meanes. In such sort as now vpon the saide foundation, there is erec∣ted a well conditioned and substantiall frame.</P>
<P>Wherein is to bee noted, the fruite of the workmens diligence. In the perfour∣mance whereof, it doeth appeare, eche workeman to haue well &amp; sufficiently dis∣charged their seuerall charge and voca∣tions, to the well likyng of the Founders and beholders.</P>
<P>In such wise, as when it is considered what benifite and commoditie is lyke in
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
short processe of tyme to grow to the foū∣ders therof: Then is it not to be thought to haue beene more chargeable then in tyme the same may be profitable.</P>
<P>Which stately building being compa∣red with the reedifiyng and building vp of the house of God, which consisteth not in Temples made with stones, accor∣ding to the traditiōs of men: Albeit, God <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 7.</NOTE> requireth a house of prayer, whereas the people may in all reuerence, congregate themselues together. As in the Churche there in all obedience to be in a readines with attentyue eares, &amp; reioysing hearts: to heare the diuine seruice of God, and that our hearyng may bee rightly with a gladsome desire to heare Christ speake vnto vs by the mouth of the minister and godly Preachers, out of the worde of God, thereby to learne to folowe Christ by obedience, in honest conuersation of lyfe. For Christ hath alwayes allow∣ed better of obedience, then of sacrifice: As appeareth in the first Booke of <HI>Sa∣muel.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ring. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>When it repented God that euer he
<PB REF="70" MS="y"/>
had made <HI>Saul</HI> Kyng by reason of his disobedience. Albeit, <HI>Saul</HI> had spared the best of the sheepe and of the Oxen of the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> to sacrifice them vnto the Lorde. Wherein <HI>Saul</HI> obeyed and hear∣kened vnto the voyce of the people, and turned away from the worde of the Lord. In so muche as it was tolde <HI>Saul</HI> by <HI>Sa∣muell.</HI> That forasmuche as he had cast a∣way the worde of the Lorde. The Lorde would cast away <HI>Saul,</HI> and rent away his kyngdome from him. In which parcell of scripture it is woorthely to bee noted, howe muche God hath beene pleased in former ages with obedience, and displea∣sed with the contrary.</P>
<P>As this one exsample may lead vs vn∣to. That the voyce of a man may awake one out of sleepe: So that hee beginneth to start and aryse, but then if hee straight wayes falleth a sleepe agayne, vntyll we see him stande and goe, wee may not truely say he is perfectly awaked.</P>
<P>Albeit, in folowing &amp; obeying Christ, it is not ment that wee neyther can, nor must doe all things that he hath done be∣fore vs: but to folowe him in godly con∣uersation
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
of lyfe and obedience as neare as we may, otherwyse what doeth it a∣uayle to professe much, and to practice li∣tle. Wherby we are admonished to ioyne practice with our profession, in the repai∣ring and building vp of the house of God, in all godlinesse and humilitie: and with more diligence and care then was vsed in &amp; about the reedifiyng of the foresaide building of London Bridge, which as you may perceiue in the former discourse was not easily perfourmed without great cost and labour. So ought all Christians to bende them selues to the vttermost of <NOTE PLACE="marg">What fourme ought to be ob∣serued in the perfiting of Gods house.</NOTE> euery their powers, all to agree in one generall consent and vnitie of brotherly loue, whereby the Lordes house myght speedily goe forwarde: And not as <HI>Ma∣nasses,</HI> against <HI>Ephraim,</HI> and <HI>Ephraim,</HI> a∣gainst <HI>Manasses,</HI> and both against <HI>Iuda:</HI> Lest God beholdyng suche a confusion, come and say vnto thee, as vnto the figge <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 11.

<P>In consideration whereof, it is to bee noted, that although the founders vnder
<PB REF="71"/>
God of his house here in Englād, which God euer mainteyne and increase, are nowe willyng, &amp; haue bene of long tyme with the aduise of the best workmen that might be had, in so carefull a worke, and about so weightie a cause, suche as God be thanked haue not seassed to take great paynes in Englande, for the perfecting of so woorthie a worke, and therein ma∣ny good people about London and in o∣ther places haue and doe declare them selues very studious and paynfull to haue the same perfourmed. In so muche as God be praysed there are some certaine, that willingly and gladly doe shew them selues to bee faythfull labourers in the house of God. But the greater number besides, seeme to be suche as in very deed woulde be accompted good labourers in Gods Vineyarde, who in deedes doe appeare playne, to bee but Loyte∣rers, when as the maister of the Vine∣yarde shall come to tryall. It is true, hee wyll not deny his good Stewardes, Bailiffes, and faythfull seruauntes their due rewarde: At what tyme all the con∣trery will be founde to be too too negli∣gent
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
in suche their duetifull businesse, some of obstinate, frowarde, and malici∣ous myndes, and some by foolishe igno∣raunce, lyke vnto the fyue foolishe Vir∣gines. And many suche as doe flatter <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 20.</NOTE> themselues with the parable of those whō the good husbandmā was willyng to re∣tayne in his Vineyarde: and gaue vnto him for his hyre that came at the thirde houre of the day, as large as vnto those which entered at the first houre, and dyd beare the heate of the day. Whereby it is manifest, that the same good husbande man who is our Sauiour Christ, hath alwayes had a lyke care for all in gene∣rall, and will deny none of their hyre, that came vnto him in any tyme, in mind to be accepted.</P>
<P>But alas, what may be sayd or thought of suche as doe deferre and set off their commyng into the Lordes Vineyarde, euen vntyll their laste houre. And then perhaps doe as it were looke ouer the hedge, and doe commyt their good deeds to bee sent after them by Executors, in hope to receiue their rewarde w<SUP>t</SUP> the first.
<PB REF="72"/>
Wherein is not to be forgotten, that al∣though our heauenly husbandman, hath dealt and doeth deale so fauourably in his mercyes, with so many as hee findeth so∣rowful and careful to lyue with him. And not obstinately or willingly to pine them selues away for want of a litle paines ta∣king, wherby to procure vnto themselues foode and rewarde, which I doe so muche the more lament, whyle I doe beholde a number whose lyues doe bewray that they care not to haue to do with God nor his house, suche as may not be persuaded to enter into the same, and other some such and that for the most parte, who if they happen a litle to enter in, they soone wax weary, and so stealeth foorth againe. In so much as it is very doubtfull, that any suche shall haue any part of reward with the true labourers: but rather shal want foode when as they shall be hungrye and thirstie, and shall alwayes be drye. And so in case to perish for want of that which they so contemptuously and negligently refused, when the large measure was of∣fered vnto them through Christ his me∣rites and louing kindnesse. In so muche
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
as rather it is to be desired that all those that haue any feeling desire in them selus to come into the Lordes Vineyarde, and to dwell with God in his euerlasting mā∣sion, may refuse no paynes to bee ioyned vnto him in ioyfull gladnesse of Ghostly rauishing, which is to be sought from the high to the lowe, with all due humilitie &amp; reuerence vnto God, loue to our neigh∣bours, &amp; obedience vnto our soueraigne, vdder whose protection next vnder God, we doe enioye our being and continuyng in so good a woorke, for the which euery true member of England is bound daily and hourely to pray vnto God, that so good a foundation of the house of GOD may become so well framed and perfec∣ted, as to encrease &amp; remayne vnremoue∣able, to the euerlasting comfort of all the professors: As is testified by the scrip∣tures. The earth shall fayle, &amp; all things <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 5.</NOTE> therein conteined: but the worde of God abideth euerlasting, and one iotte of his worde shall not fayle. And when we haue done all that euer we can doe, yet shal we be but vnprofitable seruants.</P>
<P>By these words, some may doubt what
<PB REF="73"/>
they ought to doe in so weightie a mat∣ter, it is in these fewe wordes declared. That wee ought to preferre the glory of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A speciall note for all that pro∣fesse Christ.</NOTE> God, the promotyng of Christ his Euan∣gil, that is, his word, and the saluation of our soules, aboue all things in the earth.</P>
<P>So shall we bee sure that though all the worlde besides were in an vprore and troubles: Though warres and contenti∣ons, plagues, &amp; pestilence, and all incon∣ueniences were round about vs, yet shold we be defended and protected. For so is Gods louyng promises vnto so many, as with willyng and obedient heartes doe seeke to be preserued in his folde, expres∣sing their inwarde desires, by their out∣ward conuersation and actions. By rea∣son whereof, many haue beene stirred to forsake their froward wayes: and return vnto the Lord, by ensample of Kyng <HI>E∣zechia,</HI> as foloweth. And <HI>Ezechia</HI> sent <NOTE PLACE="marg">In the 2. boke of the Chro. Chap. 30.</NOTE> to all <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Iuda,</HI> and wrote letters to <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Manasses,</HI> that they shold come to the house of the Lorde at <HI>Ierusa∣lem,</HI> &amp; offer passeouer vnto the Lord God of <HI>Israel.</HI> And the Kyng helde a counsell with his Lordes, &amp; all the congregation
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> to keepe the feast of passeo∣uer in the seconde moneth.</P>
<P>And the tenour of his letters was this:</P>
<P>You sonnes of <HI>Israel,</HI> returne to the Lorde God of <HI>Abraham, Isaac &amp; Iacob,</HI> and he shall returne to the residue that re∣steth from the handes of <HI>Assur.</HI> Be not as your fathers, and as your brethren were, who haue transgressed against the Lorde God of their Fathers, who hath made them desolate as you see. Holde not your heartes therefore. But giue your hands to the Lorde, returne to his Sanctuary, serue him and hee shall. shewe mercy vn∣to you, to your sonnes and daughters that be in bondage, for he is pitifull and easie to bee entreated. Thus farre dyd <HI>Ezechias</HI> by letters and messengers pro∣uoke the people declined from God, to repentaunce, not onely in <HI>Iuda</HI> where he raygned lawfull Kyng, but also in <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> subiecte then to an other Kyng. And albeit, that by some wicked men, his messengers were mocked, so lac∣ked they not theyr iust punishmentes: For within sixe yeares after <HI>Samaria,</HI>
<PB REF="74"/>
was destroyed, and <HI>Israel</HI> ledde captyue by <HI>Salmanazar.</HI> So dyd not this zealous King <HI>Ezechias</HI> desist to prosecute his du∣tie in restoring the religion to Gods per∣fect ordinance, remauyng all wickednes.</P>
<P>And again, in the Prophecie of <HI>Eze∣chiel,</HI> it is written thus: If a man nowe <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 34.</NOTE> heare the noyse of the Trumpet, and will not be warned, and the Stewarde come and take him away, his bloude shall bee vpon his owne head: for hee heard the sounde of the Trumpet, and woulde not take heede, therefore his bloud be vppon him. But if he will receiue warning, he shal saue his lyfe. Moreouer, if the watch∣man see the sworde come, and shew it not with the Trumpet, so that the people is not warned, if the sworde come then and take any man from amōg them, the same shall bee taken away in his owne sinne: but his bloud will I require at the watch mans hande.</P>
<P>So is it required at the handes of all good Gouernors in this age, that the or∣der <NOTE PLACE="marg">An order of planting or graftyng.</NOTE> of plantyng may be obserued in suche fourme, that euery tree may be so orderly planted and ingraffed, that there may be
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
no confused growyng. For it is written, that suche as are not ingraffed in Christ, shall be pulled vp by the rootes: where∣fore it behooueth that euery good Tree may be framed to be comfortable and de∣fencible to the other his neighbour and stander by, beyng all of one Orchard, the higher to the lower, and the lower not to be slacke in vpright growyng, to the end to doe their office, duetie, and good will, vnto the higher. For so is it required by the worde of God, and no politike wise∣dome rightly may deny the same: as that when any stormy weather should happen to blowe vp, that then suche as before would haue beene iudged Okes, shoulde not shew them selues as tottering reeds, subiecting them selues to bee ouerrunne with euery sickle and sythe. But that ra∣ther against the time, that god shal please by his prouidence to call vs vnto him more nearer, by any Crosse of tribulati∣on: that wee the people of this age may rather goe forwarde to meete with God in all reuerence, and valiantly to fight vn∣der his banner. Then that we should goe backeward with faintyng heartes, and
<PB REF="75"/>
seeke to hide our selues from his presence which no man may escape, for that his glorious presence is euery where, both on high vpon the Mountaies, and beneth in the vallies. How much more ought we miserable creatures to bee vigilant, and that by continuall prayer and watching, thereby to mooue his Godhead not to be greeued nor displeased for our disobedi∣ence in transgressing of his Commaun∣dements: And that it may please him in his mercie to accept of our contrition in our returning euery one, forsaking his frowarde and vngodly wayes. And that with such repentaunce and mortification, as sinne may be abandoned and haue no place any longer to dwell in our mortall bodyes: And not to seeme too haue more care of thinges temporall, then of things eternall. For so nowe is it required at our hands in good earnest, thereby to stop the mouthes of all enemies, as that other nations beholding the perfect fourme of our returning, may haue iust cause so to say of England:</P>
<P>Lo these are the people whome God
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
hath chosen vnto him selfe, and that the troubles of our neyghbours may sounde a continuall watche worde in our eares, to amendment of our former euil liuing, or els wee may assure our selues, that wee doe but hasten the lyke measure of Gods displeasure towardes vs, which I pray God graunt to keepe farre from Englande.</P>
<P>And in the manner of our retur∣nyng, let vs take and sette before our tyes, this holesome doctryne of Saint <HI>Paule</HI> to <HI>Timothie,</HI> in his fyrst Epi∣stle. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tim. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>I exhort therfore that aboue all things, Prayers, supplications, intercessions, and giuyng of thanks be had for all men: For Kynges and all that are in authori∣tie, that wee may lyue a quyet and a peaceable lyfe, with all godlinesse and honestie. For that is good and ex∣pedient in the sight of GOD our Sauiour, which will haue all men to bee saued, and to come vnto the know∣ledge of the trueth: For there is one
<PB REF="76"/>
God and one Mediatour, betwixt God and man: Euen the man Christ Iesus, which gaue him selfe a raunsome for all men. That it should bee testified at this tyme, I tell the trueth in Christ and lye not. Beyng the teachers of the Gentiles with fayth and veritie. I will therefore that the men pray euery where, liftyng vp pure handes without wrath or doub∣ting. Likewyse also the women, that they aray them selues in comely apparel, with shamefastnesse and discreete behauiour, not with broydered heare, eyther gold, or pearles, or costly aray: but as becom∣meth women that professe godlines tho∣row good works. Let the women learne in silence with all subiection, in such wise as all suche as pray, may obtaine the be∣nefit of prayer, which ought to be framed in all zealous maner, and with such a du∣tifull obedience as we doe owe vnto God in making our prayers and supplicati∣ons: As we haue sundrye ensamples set owne vnto vs by the word of God.</P>
<P>First, howe Christ him selfe when he prayed vnto God the Father, that if it were his will, the bitter cup of his passi∣on
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
might passe away from him, not for that Christ was afrayd of death, but that hee woulde leaue vnto all his Disciples the true fourme of prayer, desiryng no∣thing but that which is good, and to edi∣fie with all, and alwayes to commyt our willes vnto his will: not that our will be done, but that his will be done, and fulfil∣led, with such obedience as Christ, when <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> he prayed, lifted vp his eyes vnto hea∣uen.</P>

And in this our age, no doubt of it, by the good prayers of godly men powred out before the Lorde God, for the be∣holdyng of the people of Englande, in suche an acceptable a tyme, as God hath bene mooued in his mercyes to pro∣tect his flocke hitherto in a miraculous wyse, with nowe full twentie yeares past of returnyng, which large tyme no doubt of it, hath pleased God in his mercy to vouchsafe to assigne vnto vs the people of England, the rather for the good affectiō which he hath and doth beare vnto our so gratious and soueraigne Queene, vnder whom by Gods permission we do enioye such good blessings, as <HI>Moyses</HI> gaue vnto the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> in time of their con∣tinuing in Gods cōmandements &amp; ordi∣nāces, who is like vnto the people.

<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
art saued in the Lord, which is the shield of thy helpe, &amp; sword of thy glory. Thine enimyes haue lost their strength to thee ward, &amp; thou shalt treade vpon the height of them. But then it foloweth, that when <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 19.</NOTE> as God did behold the grudging and dis∣obedience of the Israelites, hee appoyn∣ted <HI>Moyses</HI> to commaund them that they shoulde not presume to come vp vnto the Lord lest be destroyed them. And let the Priests which come vnto the Lord, sanc∣tifie them, lest the Lorde destroye them. Wherevpon God gaue foorth the Table of the ten Commaundementes, left vnto all that shoulde come after, to folow them as children of obedience.</P>
<P>And for that cause doe all the godly Preachers crye out daily foorth of the worde of God, Repent betymes as wee all doe admonish yee, repent, for your cō∣tempt and wickednesse so plainely com∣mitted, in so blessed a tyme as God was not more professed in woordes in many yeares before. But alas, too too farre out of the way in deedes: wherfore we are stil called to repent, for repentance is the onely way of our redresse &amp; deliuerance.
<PB REF="78"/>
For, dyd God euer so long spare anye whome he hath taught by his Prophets without some euident repentaunce: Or vseth any father to pardō his childe, with∣out some token of amendment: Consider howe the Lord hath intreated <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Iuda,</HI> his owne people. Howe ofte they trespassed, and howe he gaue them ouer into the handes of their enemyes. But when so euer they repented and turned a∣gaine to God vnfeignedly, he sent them Iudges and deliuerers, Kyngs and Sa∣uiours. This way then of repentance and vnfeigned turnyng vnto God by obedi∣ence, is the onely way before God accep∣ted and allowed.</P>
<P>Therfore was <HI>Noah</HI> sent into the old worlde to bring this doctrine of repen∣tance, and all the olde Prophets, as <HI>Eli∣as, Eliseus, Esaias, Ieremias,</HI> and <HI>Mali∣chias,</HI> and hee who excelled all the Pro∣phets, Iohn Baptist, whose sharpe re∣bukes for sinnes woulde nowe be hardly abyde and suffered.

<HI>Noah</HI> pronounced that within an hundreth and twentie yeares all fleshe shoulde bee destroyed. Wee haue many <HI>Noahs</HI> that doe crye in our tymes, yet fewe repent. All that tyme that <HI>Noah</HI> was preparyng of the Arke, to auoyde Gods vengeance, the multitude derided this holy Prophete, as many nowe doe make a scoffe at all them that by obedi∣ence to Gods worde, seeke the meanes appoynted to auoyde Gods indignation and iudgements. Then the people wold not repent: but as they shoulde lyue for e∣uer, they maryed, they banquetted, they builded, they planted, but not in God. And so it is muche to be feared, that in this age, there are many that do the like: they marry, but not in God: they builde, but not in trueth and righteousnesse: and therefore because their buildyng is not accordyng to Gods direction, they know not howe soone it shall fall downe.

Wherein is expressed a wonderfull comfort: first is to be considered, how the Lorde our God maker of heauen &amp; earth, doeth humble him selfe, not onely to bee called a husbandman, a housholder, and suche lyke: But he abaseth him selfe of mercy, to vs vile earth and ashes, that his sonne became man to make mankynde glorious in his sight, to make all those that do not refuse his grace offered, of the slaues of Saten, his sonnes by adoption: We are his sonnes, we are his Vinyard, wee are as deare vnto him as the Apple of his eye: As <HI>Moyses</HI> speaketh, if you can beleeue it, hee sweareth that you shal be his inheritance, and he will be yours: If yee will onely beleeue his grace offe∣red, and beleeue him when hee sweareth. Will yee call his trueth into doubt? his glorye into shame by your misreliefe: Better it were that all creatures should perishe, Heauen, man, and Aungels, then that GOD shoulde not haue cre∣dite, or that his power and glorye in the least iotte shoulde bee dimini∣shed.

<P>But if neyther the meanes of Gods mercyes offered, nor his punishement threatned for sinne, may not mooue obsti∣nate

people to returnyng vnto the Lorde in good earnest, and that they will looke for signes, lyke vnto the Scribes and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 12.

For <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and <HI>Damasco,</HI> neuer possessed more greater blessinges then Englande nowe doeth, nor none of those Cities ne∣uer enioyed more pompe then London nowe possesseth. And it is certaine, that Christ preached three yeares in those two famous Cities, and the Countreys vnto them adiacent. And after fortie yeares <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was destroyed, so long a time dyd God giue vnto them of repentaunce and returning from their froward wayes wherein those people so proudly walked in disobedience. And the same God of long tyme hath called his litle flocke of Englande, as the remnaunt of <HI>Israel,</HI> by
<PB REF="85"/>
the largenesse of his mercy offered. But the same seemeth to haue taken so little effecte, as that a great number with the consent of disobedience, haue taken occa∣sion by their owne wickednesse, to pro∣uoke <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tob. 12.</NOTE> almyghtie God vnto displeasure, in suche lamentable wyse, as many are become enemyes and betrayers of their owne soules, for which their so greeuous contempt none may escape the punishe∣ment: As it hath bene declared in all no∣table punishmentes from the beginning. For when the originall worlde perished by water, when <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 7. 19.</NOTE> was consumed by fyre. And finally, when <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was horribly destroyed, doeth any man thinke that all were lyke wic∣ked: it is euident that they were not Ne∣uerthelesse, although some were young, and dyd not know what oppression ment, neyther coulde defile them selues with beastly and vnlawfull lustes, some were pitifull and gentle of nature, and dyd not thirst for the bloud of Christ his apostles. But did any in the time of Gods visitati∣on escape the plagues &amp; vēgeance which did apprehēd the multitude. Let the scrip¦tures
<PB N="80" REF="85"/>
witnesse, and the histories be con∣sidered, which plainly doe testifie, that by the waters all fleshe in earth at that time dyd perishe, <HI>Noah</HI> and his family reser∣ued: That none escaped in <HI>Sodome</HI> and in the other Cities adiacent, excepte Lot and his two daughters. And euident it is, that in that famous Citie <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> in that last destruction of the same, none escaped Gods vengeance except so ma∣ny as before were dispersed. And what the cause was of this Gods seueritie, we are forbidden to dispute with God. But let all men by these examples learne be∣tymes, to flee and auoyde to commit such lyke abominations as the proude con∣temners of God doe prosecute, if the re∣sidue list not to bee partakers of theyr plagues. And yet the causes are eui∣dent, for which GOD brought so hor∣rible destruction vppon those Cityes, manifestyng that wee shoulde bee sub∣iect without grudgyng vnto Gods will and iudgementes, which in them selues are most holy and iust.

Wherefore it behooueth that we of this age, should all humble our selues vnder the mightie hande of God, in such wyse as he in his mercy, beholding our humi∣litie, may bee mooued to turne away his wrathfull displeasure from vs. For in the originall worlde, none was found in au∣thoritie, that eyther dyd resist tyranny, or oppression, that vniuersally was vsed, ey∣ther yet that earnestly reprehended the same. In <HI>Sodome,</HI> was none found, that dyd gainstande that furious and beastly multitude that dyd compasse about, and besiege the house of <HI>Lot:</HI> None would be∣leeue <HI>Lot</HI> that the Citie should be destroi∣ed. And finally, in <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was none founde, that studied to represse the tyran∣ny of the Priestes, and therefore of one vengeance temporall, were they all par∣takers. Which examples in sundry pla∣ces before touched, ought to mooue euery one that hath any feelyng iudgement in them selues, to the deepe consideration of their dueties, in this last age &amp; perillous tymes.

And let it not be forgotten, howe that <HI>Ionas</HI> the Prophet, was but three dayes in his deliueryng of the Lordes message vnto that great Citie of <HI>Niniuee:</HI> That after fortie dayes the same Citie shoulde be destroyed. And those people knowyng them selues guiltie of transgression of Gods commaundementes, beleeued the Lorde, and proclaimed fasting with one accord among them all: and put on sack∣cloth, as well the great as the small, the rich as the poore. The Kyng did cast off his costly aray, y<SUP>t</SUP> he was wont to weare, and put on sackcloth, as then the manner was of declaring repentance: for he fea∣red God. In so much as God beholdyng their contricion in an acceptable tyme, turned from his forepurposed destructi∣on, which was pronounced to haue fal∣lē vpō that great Citie after fortie daies, according to the message of <HI>Ionas:</HI> had not both the King &amp; the people bene tou∣ched with so zealous affection vnto God &amp; his word: As they beleeued the Lordes message without any further doubtyng, and those people founde fauour in Gods fight.</P>

As God graunt Englande, in rende∣ring of their due obedience to do the like, in expressing our vnfeigned repentance, by our outward actions: for wee can not excuse our selues by ignorance, as to say, that we want of such like warning. For common experience may teache sensible men, that if one man receiue a hand wri∣ting from an other, great credite is giuen therevnto, especially when there is fayth and confidence betwixt the partie who sent the writing, and the parties vnto whom the same is sent. In so muche as euery man and woman ought to examine in them selues what confidence euery one doeth repose in God his written worde: and what zealous loue euery one beareth in his heart toward the same. And let vs not be vnmindfull that there is a time to laugh, and a tyme to weepe, a tyme to go forwarde, and a tyme to goe backwarde. Wherby all are forewarned from goyng backwarde, like the frowarde nature of the Sea Crabbe. But rather seeing that we doe beare the Image of Christ, let vs in tyme refraine, from glutting &amp; ladyng our selues with muddy earth, lyke vnto
