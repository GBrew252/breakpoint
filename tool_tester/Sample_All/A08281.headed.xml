<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HO∣norable my singular good Lord and Ma∣ster, <HI>Robert</HI> Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Ewe,</HI> Lord <HI>Ferrers</HI> of <HI>Chartley, Bourcher</HI> and <HI>Louaine,</HI> of her Ma∣iesties most honorable priuie Counsell, and Knight of the most noble order of the Garter.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lbeit (right Honorable) the indeuours of best deseruers, and of men qualified with highest gifts of all kinds of ver∣tues, be subiect to deprauing censures, I, the meanest of many other, am mo∣ued by the loue I beare to my countrie, in all reuerence and zeale, according to my portion of knowledge (sith the better able affoord it not) to aduenture some thing to the incouragement of men trained and to be trai∣ned to the field in Militarie seruice: not as teaching them the <HI>art of warre,</HI> but inciting them to <HI>obedience</HI> to God, their Prince and Commanders, to vertuous and diuine exercises, to the practise of profitable, and of praise worthie actions, and to the auoyding of things offensiue, hurtfull and fruitles. For if none should speake because they haue captious hearers: if none should write because they haue deprauing readers; what would become of the vse of the tongue or practise of the pen? If none should vndertake but what they were assured should please all men, there would follow speedie ruine of all vertuous indeuours in whatsoeuer kinde. For none is so absolute by art or nature, but that some being meere <HI>naturals</HI> without art or vertue, will struggle to glorifie their own
<PB REF="3"/>
<HI>nothing,</HI> by deprauing the <HI>something</HI> of others. No good inde∣uour (intended to Gods glorie) can be so simple and fruitles, but it will yeeld some profite to the well disposed: and no worke is so excellent but is altogether fruitles to the euill affected. Best things haue least grace among the worst, and the prophanest workes best welcome to prophane men. But such as sauour of diuine reason will imbrace the good fruites euen of poorest knowledge, and will reiect the most absolute worke of a carnall conceit. And if I had not hope grounded vpon mine owne, as al∣so vpon publique experience of your honorable clemencie, to accept of vertuous indeuours at the hands of the meanest, I could not (at this time) affoord scope vnto my sorrowing thoughts, daunted, dulled, and dismaied at the dismall issue of former hope, to expose vnto a generall gaze, this sillie Mirror, which vnder your Honorable protection, I know may safely passe through the pikes with profit to many, preiudiciall to none, but behoofull to all. And it craueth at my hands no safer shelter from the malice of the worst, nor better warrant to passe currant among the best, than your Lordships allowance, which in discretion I cannot denie it, though I cannot assure it. Yet I am vrged to aduenture my selfe for it, and it for me, vnto your Honorable considera∣tion. And while I waite in hope, I doe and will euer rest a dutifull petitioner to the God of hoasts, to fur∣nish your Honor with all happines, and happie issue of all your Hono∣rable enterprises.</P>

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Othing is so rashly, rudely, or vnadui∣sedly vndertaken, but that reason or discretion seemeth to direct the same: and most of all Militarie attempts are to bee enterprised with high deuotion, because they tend to peace the most pre∣cious end of warre. For there seemeth as great difference betweene peace and warre, as betweene a sober and a mad man: the one plausible, sweete and profitable to many, the other ter∣rible and troublesome to all, and truly profi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able to none. It is a per∣nicious euill, as of it selfe, but by circumstances it is both lawfull and expedient, not that <HI>it openeth the way to heauen by slaughter and bloud,</HI> as <HI>Scipio</HI> of <HI>Affricke</HI> boasted, but that it is the way to re∣deeme most wished peace. When the cause is iust no man may que∣stion whether the warre bee lawfull. It is then iust when it seeketh to defend and preserue the publique quiet and Christian religion, and it is then lawful, when it is done by the authority of the Prince, and rightly vndertaken when it is in the feare of God, and truly ex∣ecuted when it is with vpright minds. As touching the iustice and lawfulnes of the cause present, it sufficeth vs to know it is to pre∣serue our state, the superiour Magistrate commandeth it, and wee are to obey it in a treble dutie, to God, our Soueraigne and common∣weale, to the end we may possesse our owne in quiet vnder the prote∣ction of equitie and iustice, which both are established by peace, and peace maintained by suppressing warre. Our present warre is a de∣fence against hostile offence, which (as euery man seeth) threatneth vnto vs the dreadfull deuouring sword, or such wretched seruitude
<PB REF="4"/>
as was neuer shewed vnto the <HI>Iewes</HI> in <HI>Aegypt</HI> or <HI>Babylon.</HI> For the experienced tyrannies of our aduersaries haue many wayes and in diuers places, displaied their bloudie inclination to bee more than heathenish: and therefore our estate (aymed at by their cruell de∣sires) is neither to faint or flatter it selfe, but in the name of the God of hoasts to goe foorth with our armies, and with courage onely in Christ to witnes our Christian fortitude: not as some great Mar∣tialists haue done, that haue sought and gotten fame by bloud, as <HI>Herod, Hannibal, Caesar, Attila,</HI> and infinite others, who haue left behinde them nothing whereof truly to glorie, onely the stinke of their ambition, and slaughter of men remaineth. And our present enemies testifie their apt imitation of these tyrants in all their vi∣ctories, wherein they regarde nothing more then the number of townes burned, and of men, women and children murthered. And he priseth his reputation dearest, that hath inhumanely bereaued most of life, and most tyrannously behaued himselfe in the warres, without feare of God, or clemencie towards man: shewing thereby how farre they degenerate in affection from true Christians, that imbrace compassion and mercy as the badges of true religion, which teacheth that wee ought to conforme our mindes to a godly procee∣ding in the affayres of warre, without rigour, tyrannie and supersti∣tious lenitie. And to this end ought all men called to the profession of armes to be furnished with diuine vertues, that all their proceedings may sauour of godlines and godly boldnes. And for as much as (by reason of our vsurped libertie to sinne more in this profession then is fit in any) we are depriued as of our owne natures, of the true knowledge of that good course which in these dangers of warre is to be taken. And therefore all militarie men ought to haue conti∣nuall counsell and consultation with the God of armies, disclayming their owne wisedomes, iudgements and valour, and to followe what is commanded in, or agreeth with his word. The Common-wealth of <HI>Israel</HI> was held happie for that it might aske, and receiue coun∣sell and direction in all their proceedings of God by <HI>Vrim</HI> and <HI>Thummim.</HI> But much more blessed are we in that the diuine light shineth vnto vs in Christ, whereby the true meaning of the spirit is expounded in the word of trueth, whereunto all men are inuited
<PB REF="4"/>
freely to referre themselues, and therein to search diligently what dutie is required of them in their seuerall functions: for therein hath God declared his mind and will concerning all things where∣with man hath to deale in this life. From thence must euery degree be furnished with warrant and direction how to proceede in their professions: therein is the Prince taught how to rule rightly, the subiects how to obey loyally: therein are Commanders in the warres directed how to dispose of their charge wisely, and the inferiour souldiers may therein learne how to frame both their affections and all their proceedings godly. And for that the office of a souldier is a calling of higher reckoning and of greater moment then it is commonly reputed by the generall and rude multitude, yea, then it is considered to be, of the most that vndertake to carrie armes in the field, and of some that beare office in the warres: it is requisite that all should vnderstand what burthen they beare, that they may also learne to discharge the same, so as they may be worthie to be called what they desire to bee. For as the life is to the bodie, so is vertue to the minde, and the diuine spirit to the soule: the bodie without life is but a dunghill, the minde without vertue is but a sinke or gulfe of filthie cogitations, and the soule without the heauenly comforter is but a forlorne captiue vnder the Prince of darknes. Ignorance of the will of God is a darke clowde that shadoweth all diuine quali∣ties, and that smoothereth euery sacred grace and speciall fauour receiued at the hands of the highest, whereby a souldier becommeth oftentimes proud of vanitie, and couetous and greedie of vitious and hurtfull in stead of vertuous and profitable things: whereby he becommeth conquered of his owne carnall affections, making him∣selfe thereby vnfit to vndertake that honorable action which onlie is proper to the vertuous, and to such as feare God. Such as are ar∣med with diuine habiliments within, aswell as girded with milita∣rie furniture without. For who so considereth that he fighteth for the Lords cause, for his Princes state, his countries good, and his owne honour, cannot but thinke himselfe bound to cast off all im∣pediments that may hinder his prosperitie, or blemish his reputa∣tion therein. For there is no assurance in things displeasing the King of Kings, in things vnsauourie to the spirit of God, who being
<PB REF="5"/>
on our side giueth vs victorie: but if we defraude him of the reue∣rence and honour due vnto him from our selues at home, and from our men of war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e abroad, wee haue no assurance that he is with vs and for vs. And therefore <HI>when we goe foorth with our Armies</HI> (saith Moses) <HI>we must then keepe vs from all wickednesse: for that the Lord himselfe walketh in the middest of our campe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to deliuer vs, and to giue the enemie into our hands, if we be holie: but to destroy vs if we be prophane, faithles and wicked.</HI> And it h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th been euer a noted subtiltie of a wicked enemie prompted by <HI>Sathan,</HI> to lay traps and snares to cause Christians to sinne. <HI>Search</HI> (saith <HI>Achior) if there bee any wickednesse among them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudith. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> <HI>then shall wee surely destroy them, otherwise we shall neuer preuaile against them, for their God will defend them.</HI> And it seemeth that our aduersaries haue no greater encouragement, then to see the fruites of our grosse corruptions, affirming that wee feare not God, because wee transgresse his will so boldly: and aboue all they take notice of the vnciuill behauiour and licentious liues of our men in the warres, grounding greater hope to preuaile, by reason of our sinnes, then by their owne forces. Experience hath long tolde vs that there hath been defect of vertuous exercises among men of militarie profession, who seeking to be renowmed, begin not at the feare of God, but yeelding their mindes captiue to sinne, come con∣quered into the field: and therefore their enterprises often faile of victorie. But howsoeuer some deeme the contrary, it doth higly dignifie men of armes, to feare and serue the liuing God, and to bee at one with him, before they presume to march to the battell, or vn∣dertake to beare armes in the field. And all such as are called to that high and worthie calling ought to be changed in their minds, casting off all the former lusts of the flesh, to shape their affections after a more holie order: for the neerer they resemble the great conqueror, by participation of his diuine vertues, so much the more powerfull shall they become, and bee partakers also of his glorie by conquering by him, as were <HI>Gideon, Barac, Sampson, Iepthath, Dauid, Samuel,</HI> and many other that in and by him ouercame king∣domes, and obtained many admirable victories against their ene∣mies. It is an honorable thing in Commanders to be able to exhort
<PB REF="5"/>
by word to godlines of life, but more honorable when their exhor∣tation is ioyned with the example of a vertuous life: for the one proceedeth from the tongue, which may dissemble before the world, the other from the heart, which is knowne to God. And he that is truely sound within, cannot but appeare vnto others to be so: for he will bring foorth the fruites of approbation, among which it is not the least to haue care of the choice of his souldiers, as of the most vertuous, as much as lieth in him, after the example of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who sayd vnto his souldiers: <HI>My friends, I haue chosen you, not be∣cause I haue had experience heretofore of your manhood, but because I haue knowne you readie to doe those things which are honest, and to eschew all dishonestie.</HI> In his choice he seemed to agree with the opinion of valiant <HI>Agamemnon</HI> a Grecian Cap∣taine, who affirmed to <HI>Achilles,</HI> that <HI>one man beloued of God, is in stead of many men in an armie.</HI> On the contrarie the Scrip∣ture affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iousha <HI>7.1.2</HI></NOTE> that the wickednesse of one man indangereth the state of a whole armie, as <HI>Achan</HI> did the armie of <HI>Israel.</HI> The Em∣perour <HI>Traian</HI> sayd, <HI>to accept of warre, to collect souldiers, to put them in order, and to giue battell, belonged to man: but to giue victorie was the worke of God onely.</HI> Whereby it followeth, that as victorie is the end of waging battell, and battell disposed by best discretion of chiefe Commanders: so there is not a more pretious thing in the execution of this busines, then to doe all in his feare, ho∣nor and reuerence, that giueth that which is striued for. They that couet to vanquish, and not to bee vanquished, must relie wholly on him that disposeth of victorie, and to vse souldiers, munition and policie as his meanes: for if they be blessed by him, they are holie, o∣therwise they may bee aswell instruments of their owne, and of the confusion of such as trust in them as of their safetie. To the ende therefore that our enterprises may succeede to our comfort, it be∣houeth all men of armes, of what qualitie or degree soeuer he bee, not to thinke is a blemish to his reputation to be seene vertuous, re∣ligious and godly, but to testifie the same in the view of all men, by continuall exercise of prayer and praise to the God of hoasts, that he may still blesse those meanes, direct their counsels, and dispose of their proceedings happily: so shall they triumph in victorie as well
<PB REF="6"/>
with few as with many, with the godliest, and not with the greatest number of men. And to the end that all militarie men may be put in minde of this heauenly consideration, I haue presumed vnder your fauours, to speake a little vnto you in a plaine manner, not that I would be seene to presume to teach such as are alreadie furni∣shed with diuine knowledge, and are armed with faith and religion: but to whet them on to the daily practise thereof, and to stirre vp such as are more ignorant, to a desire to become also vertuous and obedient to God, and in him to their Prince and Com∣manders, that as they seeke honor, they may so at∣taine it, as may make them in deede truely honorable.</P>

This diuine and absolute assurance of Gods fauour and readinesse to helpe in the time of neede, hath been in all former Generals and Captaines fearing God, &amp; they haue preuayled, as appeareth by <HI>Joshua</HI> against <HI>Iericho, Gideon</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Madianites,</HI> and many others. And therefore, it is required, that great regard be had of the choyce of the Gene∣rall, that he be religious, fearing God, that he so order the mat∣ters appertaining to his charge, as beseemeth christian policie. Gouernement of it selfe presupposeth order, for without order, no man can gouerne his little house, much lesse an Armie of men. And gouernment is a right disposition of those thinges whereof a man taketh charge, to bring them to a good ende. And therefore many thinges are requisite in a Generall, as wel for the right ordering of the armie, (namely of the body where∣of he is the head) as also for example, that the inferiour officers may follow him as a light, leading them the right way. For that is the nature of the honest imitation of the vertuous, to become more vertuous by a vertuous guide:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffectes of Imitation and Emulatiō</HI></NOTE> as it is the propertie of wic∣ked emulation in the contrary affected.

The ende of the office of a Generall, gene∣rally taken, is to doe good for his country in the highest degree, and therefore the right administration of all necessary directi∣ons, and discipline to them that are vnder his charge, is of no small importance, for that vpon his carefulnes and high wise∣dome, dependeth much the good and happie issue and successe of victorie, although indeede the disposition of victorie, is in the Lorde. It is a token of Gods fauour, and that hee alloweth of the choyce of that Generall, that feareth him and walketh right∣ly before his people. If otherwise, he is surely aduanced to that high place, to hurle downe such to confusion, that trust in his wisedome, be he neuer so politike or warlike: and his honour is but vsurped &amp; shall be taken from him againe with ignominie.

and one hundred shall put a thousand to flight. Sith then that the necessitie of the feare and seruice of God is such, as there is no hope of good successe of an armie without it; it behooueth a Generall, who in that behalfe is Gods agent, to prouide suffi∣cient godly, sincere, and paineful Ministers, or men apt to teach the feare of the Lord vnto his people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Generall ought to haue a care to pro∣uide Ministers to teach the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople.</HI></NOTE> that not onely the Gene∣rall himself, but euery Captaine, priuate officer &amp; Souldier, may be exercised in knowledge, &amp; practise of the word in praier and thankesgiuing to God.

And it behooueth that precise choyce be made, for that his charge may import the preseruation of millions of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rea∣seth the hope of the Prince.</HI></NOTE> yea of the state of his whole countrie. And therefore the more his resolution appeareth to bee grounded vpon the feare of the Highest, so much the more hope hath his Soueraigne of prosperous expedition. And so much the more vertuous and valorous will his followers appeare, by howe much they see their Generall trulie religious. And his care (as before is said) must be to furnish his companies with the most vertuous; and as <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> dispensed with a rich dastard and cowardly world∣ling for going to warre: so and much more should religious Ge∣nerals and Captaines refuse &amp; reiect wicked persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Generals must refuse wicked persons to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to warre.</HI></NOTE> in as much as in them and their knowledge lieth.

<P>HOwsoeuer it may seeme to some a needlesse labour and vn∣profitable, to sende foorth so simple a discourse into the field among men of warre, accustomed rather to the pike, then to the penne; to the bullet, then to the Bible; and to a carelesse course of life, then to leuell their actions, according to that honestie and equitie, which is required in the warres: yet (sith Iayme my desires for their good, their comfort &amp; con∣solation) I presume to set downe in a familiar manner, some ne∣cessarie considerations of their dueties, aswel in regard of God, whome they ought chiefely to obey, as of their Prince and su∣perior Commaunders, whom he commaundeth them to obey: And to remember them of the daungers which commonly fol∣low such as neglecting vertue and exercises of thinges com∣manded, doe follow and imbrace vice, and practise things for∣bidden. Euery man I know, will fauour and follow my counsel, not as it is, but as they themselues are; if good, they will receiue it without disdaine; if euill, they will scorne it, and my good will. Sundry reasons haue moued me to vndertake this worke, and aboue the rest (God knoweth) the loue I beare to my coū∣trie threatned by the rumors of warres:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reasons mo∣uing the auctor to the worke.</HI></NOTE> and the good will I beare to my country men, that must vndertake the defence by warre. Wherein as I haue a little waded in the former treatise, to shew my duetie to the highest in military offices, so I ende∣uour to speake something to men of meaner qualities. And for that not onely report but experience it selfe doth assure me that there is defect in the māners &amp; proceedings of some mē trained vp in that most honorable exercise of warre, in regard of diuine duetie: and consequently that by tradition, the corruption flo∣weth

Though this president of a desperate person haue no warrant to be followed, yet the true affections and tried loue of these resolute subiects, are of worthie memorie, and may make dastards and cold hearted men blush, to refuse to offer themselues as sacrifices for the same. Wherefore let this suffice to moue them, to whose lot it falleth to be imployed in our coun∣tries defence, to bee obedient, readie and couragious. The <HI>obedi∣ence</HI> whereof is spoken,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Obedience im∣porteth submis∣sion.</HI></NOTE> is proued to import a submission to the will of the Soueraigne, and to the direction of such Commaun∣ders as she appoynteth to be obeyed, and it spreadeth it selfe into sundrie particular branches: for preseruation and maintenance of which, prudence and experience haue framed a law and decent order, and prescribed the same to bee obserued of euery member of an armie, vnder paine of that punishment, which by that lawe is threatned to bee inflicted: which order and law, truly execu∣ted, is called the discipline of warre.

But these are farre from that which is required in a souldier, the vse of the small peece requireth comelines, and quicknes in charging and discharging, in marching, standing, and retreiting. The like is of the pike, in whose vse is required more then abilitie to beare it at the armes end, to couch it, or ad∣uance it; the application thereof to best aduantage, at the push to annoy the enemie, and to gard himselfe, is the true end thereof. And whatsoeuer warlike weapon or instrument the younger souldier taketh in hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>A young soul∣dier cannot handle the in∣struments of warre present∣ly.</HI></P><P><HI>Nothing ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the willing.</HI></P></NOTE> he cannot forthwith mannage it after the arte of warre. And therefore it behooueth such, as will be indeed what they couet to bee called, to consult with the skilfull, to ob∣serue practise and endeuour: for to the industrious and willing minded nothing is hard. And hee that will come soonest to the perfection of a souldier, must yeeld most to discipline, and settle himselfe to sustaine all trauailes, to aduenture all perils, and to be resolute rather to dye in fight, in hope of escape by force in ouer∣comming, then to desire safetie by flying away: for death is more to be wished, in fighting in a iust cause, then life by escaping like a coward.

And doubtles, death is more bitter and terrible to the fearefull and faint hearted that flie, then to the valorous that desire to fight.

Infinite things haue bin and are daily done by prayer: it defendeth from perils, it preserueth in safetie, it obtaineth good thinges, it expelleth resisteth and withstandeth euill thinges: nothing is so hard, but prayer maketh easie; nothing so weake, but it maketh strong; nothing so strong, but it maketh weake: nothing so hid, but it reueileth; nothing so grieuous, but it maketh pleasant;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prayer the most absolute meane to pre∣uaile in warres</HI></NOTE> it is pro∣fitable in all thinges: but in the warres it exceedeth all other meanes, it maketh all thinges prosperous, all men valiant, and is neuer dismaid, neither at furious enemies, nor at vnsauorie aduersitie, nor ouercome by any temptation. This is made on∣ly to God by the godly.
