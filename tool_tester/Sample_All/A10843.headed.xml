<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here passed out, some while since, a defamatory libell vnder
the names of <HI>Charles Lawn,</HI> &amp; three other his <HI>brethren
in evill;</HI> but certainly penned by some other persons, whose
greater knowledg did arm their cruell hatred the more to
hurt: makeing them fathers of that <HI>generation, whose
teeth are as swordes, &amp; their iawteeth as knives to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 30. 14▪</NOTE>
<HI>devour the afflicted from of the earth, &amp; the pore
from among men.</HI> Agaynst whom, &amp; whose freinds
durst I vse the same liberty, in publishing to the world their
personall corruptions, which I know, &amp; could soon learn by
the testimony of honester men, then these informers, they who have written of others,
what hath pleased them, should read that which would not please them, of their own,
if not of themselves. But God forbid. My desire is rather to pacify, then further to
alienate affections: remembring Christs instruction vnto his Disciples, to <HI>blesse those</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 44.</NOTE>
<HI>that curse them: to do good to those that harm them: &amp; to pray for those
that persequute them.</HI> Besides, in following their course, I should for the faults of a
few corrupter persons, wrong the credits of many honest, &amp; innocent men: for whose sakes
I would rayther cover the others faylings, then for them, blemish the credit of the rest.
But herein speciall respect is to be had to the common truthes of the Lord Iesus by them
&amp; vs, acknowledged: vppon the honour whereof had they been but half so bent, as vppon
our disgrace, they would not thus have gratifyed the common adversaryes thereof, even
theirs, &amp; ours: &amp; with them, the Atheists &amp; Epicures in the land; by whom their
book is most affected: blessing themselves in their professed contempt of God, &amp; of all
religion, by the faylings of those (whether truely, or falsely suggested, they regarde not)
who professe his more speciall fear, &amp; service: &amp; concludeing, that all others are as ill
as themselves, though more covertly. It is the spiders disposition, so she may entangle the
silly flyes in her web, to weav out her own bowels.</P>
<P>This libell it hath pleased divers persons of note for learning, &amp; Zeal, to countenance
with their wryteings of divers kyndes. Amongst the rest, M<SUP>r</SUP> W: Ames, fearing be∣like,
lest eyther it should want credit, or I discredit by the accusations in it against the per∣sons
of other men in other Churches (which though they were all true, as I know some of
them to be wholy false, &amp; others impudently published by such as were themselves cheif
agents in them, yet did no more concern me, &amp; the Church with me, then did the abu∣ses
in the Ch: of Corinth, the Ch: at Rome; or those in some of the 7 Churches in Asia,
the rest, which were free from them) hath published to the world, in the body of that
book, without my consent, privity, or least suspition of such dealing, certayn private 
<PB REF="3"/>
letters passing between him, and me, about private communion betwixt the members of
the true visible Ch: and others, though he take advantage, and occasion by certain gene∣rall
wordes of myne to alter the state ef the question. The occasion of which passages if I
should also publish, I am sure he would not like it, nor had cause.</P>
<P>Now as I neyther am, nor would he thought in sensible of this vnchristian enmity, and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>
violent opposition by them against vs in the practise of those things, which themselves, as
their wryteings testify, do so far approve; so think I it a Preface very convenions for my
present purpose, to communicate with others such grounds, as vppon which they seem to
rayse the same.</P>
<P>And first, all oppositions in religion are caryed vsually with violence, as wherein men
have speciall perswasion they please God, in that their speciall work of Conscience and
Zeal for him, and his truth. And as men are in daunger to mistake errour for truth, so
to prosequute the same with wrath, and indignation, instead of true Zeal of God. And I do
much entreat, &amp; warn those men in the fear of the Lord, to beware that in-stead of Zeal
against our supposed errours, they nourish not in their hearts, wrath, and hatred against<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>
our persons. Which is a great iniquity where it is found, and most contrary vnto love, and
so vnto <HI>God who is love;</HI> &amp; the breaking of <HI>the whole law,</HI> which <HI>love fulfilleth.</HI></P>
<P>But besides this generall, they take more speciall occasion of offence at vs, &amp; our sepa∣ration,
by which we cary our differences; as wherein we do not onely in word, but even
really &amp; indeed reprove their state, &amp; standing, as vnlawfull: &amp; such, as we rayther
chuse all calamityes, by losse of country, freinds, riches, credit, liberty, yea &amp; life is
self, then by continuance therein, to <HI>withould the truth of God in vnrighteous∣nes,</HI>
&amp; vphould the chayr of Apostacy, and so to pull down wrath from heaven vppon
our heades. Which our sequestration is yet the more offensive vnto them, by how much
the nearer we were, &amp; yet are, in many things, vnited: the <HI>contentions of brethren
being as the barres of a castle:</HI> as also for that their party for the reformation of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ov. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 19.</NOTE>
their pretended nationall <HI>Iudah</HI> is thereby weakened. And as any (accordeing to the
proverb) may easily fynde a staffe, to beat a dog withall, so do men easily take occasion to
lay load vppon vs, who are for our fewnes in number, &amp; mean-nes of condition, so con∣temptible
in their eyes: &amp; against whom they have all advantages for treading vppon
vs (save the truth) which they can desire. But the L: Iesus in teaching, that <HI>the way
to life is narrow, which few fynde:</HI> &amp; that to <HI>the pore the gospell is preached,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath. 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 11. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6.</NOTE>
&amp; therevppon, that <HI>he is blessed who is not offended at him,</HI> doth plainly fore∣warn
all his servants of this offence. Others there are also, who whatsoever they boast of
the Scriptures, have for the most parte, a traditionall faith, &amp; religion: &amp; as <HI>Naaman
the Assirian</HI> would not beleev that there could be any <HI>better</HI> waters then <HI>the rivers</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>King. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>of Damascus,</HI> so neyther do they think it possible, that there should be any purer man∣ner
of worshipping God, then that, to which they have been alwaies vsed: vnto which
they are so superstitiously addicted, as they are ready to think it an hereticall way for any
man to step out of the beaten trod of their teachers traditionary religion.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
There are also beside all these, that have their politique ends, &amp; respects, for which
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey affect vpposition against vs. Some, (of the Prelats faction) to gratify their Lords.
and Maisters, at whose devotion they stand, and against whom we principally witnes:
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers, though they like not the Byshops, yet think it a point of their wisdom to take, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould vp professed opposition against vs, that vnder it as a buckler they may cover their
own irregularity, and make their iealouse Maisters beleev, that they cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
indifferently well affected towards them, being so vehemently bent against vs. Yea,
others perceaving that their own grounds do in the iudgmēt of others wise, &amp; vnpartiall,
directly lead to the way, in which we walk, and yet seing it not to be for their purposes
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have the world so to esteem of them, do vndoubtedly, streyn, &amp; wring the neck of theyr
Consciences, and courses, to look the coutrary way, that they may not be thought to have
their faces towards vs.</P>
<P>Lastly, there are, who fearing belike to be overcome of the truth we professe, if with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uiet, &amp; calm thoughtes they come to consider of it, &amp; not haveing hearts to embrace it,
do set themself against it tumultuously; like those cowards, who fearing the force of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir adversaries, do think by debaseing, &amp; revileing of them, to encourage their own
faint, &amp; feeble hearts against them.</P>
<P>But good had it been for the truth, if at it offences had onely been taken by the ad∣versaryes
thereof, and not also given by them, who have professed it: and those both
so publique, as they cannot be concealed, and so great, as they can receav no suffi∣cient
excuse. Yet are there notwithstanding divers things (and those such as will
seem, I doubt not, of weight, to the wise in heart) which both iustly may, and ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essarily
must be observed about those matters: whether offensive contentions, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther personall evilles, layd to our charge, and published to the world against
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>First then, and in the generall; the publishers of those accusations cannot be vn∣suspected
of any reasonable man: being such generally, as are both enemyes to our pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession,
and have eyther for their vnfaythfull Apostacy, or other scandalous sins, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth, been cast out of the Church and excommunicated. Now as, for the former,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is truely, and commonly sayd, that <HI>no person running away from his May∣ster,
will easily speak well of him:</HI> So doth experience confirm it, for the latter,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat scarce any condemned in any court (how iustly soever) but will complayn
eyther of the mallice of the evidence, or ignorance of the Iury, or iniustice of the
Iudg. Condemned persons must repayr their own, by ruinateing the credits of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir iudges.</P>
<P>More specially: and first, of the contentions which have faln out amongst the pro∣fessours
of this way. As <HI>Paul</HI> complayneth, that <HI>sin takeing occasion by the law,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7 8.</NOTE>
<HI>wrought in him all manner of concupiscence:</HI> so indeed hath the mallice of Sa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han,
and mans corruption taken occasion to work much evill of this kynde, by sundry
good things specially found in the professours of this truth: as 1. by their know∣iudg,
<PB REF="4"/>
2. Zeal, &amp; 3. liberty of the Gospelly.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dg,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3. 1. Ch. 1. 5. 7. 11. Ch. 3. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Knowledg,</HI> saith the Apostle, puffeth
vp: &amp; hence was it, that the same Church to which he so wrytes, exceeding other
Churches in <HI>knowledg,</HI> did also passe them in <HI>contentions, &amp; strifes:</HI> So the
Churches this way (which I may truely speak, &amp; without boasting) goeing before other
ordinary assemblyes in knowledg, are the more in daunger of contentions, without special<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
modesty, &amp; watchfulnes. Ignorant persons, &amp; peoples, are for the most parte, easily ruled,
as being content to trust other men with their faith, &amp; religion: neyther was there eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
so great peace in the Christian world (as it is called) as in the deepest darknes of popery.
2<HI><SUP>dly</SUP>,</HI> as the greatest Zeal for God is rightly found amongst Gods people, so is peace, &amp;
agreement greatly endaungered thereby, if it be not tempered with much wisdom, mode∣ration,
&amp; brotherly forbearance: &amp; that they consider not aright, that both themselves
&amp; others, are frayl men, &amp; compassed about with much ignorance, &amp; infirmity other∣wise:
who are therefore to study not onely how to have that which they like, but also
how to bear that in other men (if not intollerable) which they like not: otherwise, whilst
men think by their Zeal to warm the house, they will burn in over their own, &amp; other
mens heades. <HI>3<SUP>ly</SUP>,</HI> &amp; lastly, they onely, who enioy liberty, know how hard a thing it is
to vse it aright. And when I see them in Engl: wondering at the dissentions in this way,
methinkes I see two prisoners (being themselves fast chayned &amp; manicled together by
feet, &amp; handes) wondering to see that other men (at liberty) walk not closer together
thē they do. Theyr thraldome makes them vnequall Censurers of the abuse of our liberty.
How many thousands are there, whose very hearts are fretted with the chaynes of their
spirituall bondage? Yea how many severall factions of ministers are there, whose diffe∣rences,
if by servile fear they were not nipped in the bud, would bring forth no small both
dissensions &amp; divisions: as at this day wofull experiēce teacheth in the reformed Church∣es,
whose dissentions do infinitely exceed all that ever haue been amongst is? As igno∣rance
begot, so tyranny mainteyned the greatest peace, &amp; vnity, when pope: sh iniquity
most prevayled.</P>
<P>Now for personall offences; as we professe, &amp; avow before all men, that, for our selves,
we neyther receav, nor keep amongst vs any persons not sanctifyed in their measure (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
our discerning:) so do we not think our selves any way priveledged, eyther from the
common infirmityes of Gods more worthy servants in all ages, or from the mallice of Sa
than in thrusting vppon vs <HI>false brethren vnawares:</HI> whose hypocrisy, &amp; prophan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude 4.</NOTE>
vsurpation of the Lords Covenant, &amp; holy things, vnto which they have no right, he
often punisheth with scandalous sins, &amp; so <HI>leadeth them out amongst the workers
of iniquity.</HI> Which scandalles we could yet cover from the eyes of the world in a great
measure, if we durst (as others do) eyther let <HI>sin rest vppon our brethren:</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. 19. 7.</NOTE>

<PB REF="4"/>
lay open our own shame in the eyes of the world: &amp; so walking in our simplicity, because
we dare not be wise against the Lord Iesus Christ his order, &amp; ordinances, we have in
so great a measure our faults written in our foreheads, &amp; are a wonder, &amp; offence vnto
others, who are far better acquaynted with our faylings, then with their own.</P>
<P>But besides, if not above the rest, great offence hath been taken by many at our ex∣tream
streytnes in respect of the order wherein we walk: &amp; more specially for refuseing
communion in the private, &amp; personall exercises of religion with the better sorte in the
assemblyes; as wherein we have not onely made a separation from the wicked, &amp; from
the godly also in things vnlawfull, or vnlawfully performed, but even in their lawfull
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actions. This <HI>Mr Ames</HI> calles <HI>the bitternes of separation:</HI> &amp; for it, as it seems,
thinkes it lawfull to cast vppon me the reproach of the sins of other Churches &amp; persons,
whether truely, or falsly layd to their charg, he knoweth not; as also to insinuate against
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, that <HI>I despise</HI> the wryteings of <HI>Iunius,</HI> &amp; so of other learned men: as iustly as<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> agayn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Puritan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as he cal∣les thē.</NOTE>
others have layd to his charg the contempt of all antient wryters: wherein if men deal
vniustly with him, &amp; his freinds, let him see whether God deal not iustly, in rewarde∣ing
him as he hath served others.</P>
<P>For the matter of his letters, if I would strive with him about the Arguments, with
whom I agree in the question, I could manifest (I doubt not) how he hath not dealt
sufficiciētly in it. Whither or no there were in the assemblyes faythfull, &amp; godly persons,
&amp; the same so appearing vnto men, I never called into question, nor could without sin∣ning
greatly against myne own Conscience: the thing I feared, was the violation, &amp;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this <HI>A Iustific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Pag. 432. 433.</NOTE>

not, but onely makes light account of it, as <HI>a straung order, which is bro∣ken
by saying Amen to a godly mans prayer.</HI> But all men know, that to set light
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Argument is no sufficient answer vnto it. And many cases may be put in which

my self then conceaved of, would have cleared the question to my conscience: &amp; with
which I did wholy satisfy my self in this matter, when God gave me once to observ it.</P>
<P>My iudgment therein, &amp; the reasons of it, I have set down in the first parte of the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enerally, did separate from the formall state of the parrish assemblyes, in this persw∣sion,
<PB REF="5"/>
&amp; so practised all the while we abode in Engl: as some there continuing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
done to this day: there haveing been also sundry passages between <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Smith,</HI> &amp; me
about it: with whom I also refused to ioyn because I would vse my liberty in this point:
&amp; for which I was by some of the people with him excepted against, when I was chosen
into office in this Church. Indeed afterwardes fyndeing them of other Churches, with
whom I was most nearly ioyned, otherwise mynded for the most parte, I did thorough
my vehement desire of peace, &amp; weaknes withall, remit &amp; loose of my former resolutions
&amp; did (to speak as the truth is) forget some of my former grounds; &amp; so have passed
out, vppon occasion, some Arguments against this practise. Which yet notwithstand∣ing
I have in the same place so set down, as all may see I was therein far from that, cer∣taynty
of perswasion, which I had &amp; have of the common grounds of our separation: of
which I think this no parte at all. But had my perswasion in it been fuller, then ever it
was, I professe my self alwayes one of them, who still desire to learn further, or better,
what the good will of God is. And I beseech the Lord from myne heart, that there
may be in the men, (towards whom I desire in all things lawfull to enlarg my self) the
like readines of mynde to forsake every evill way, &amp; faythfully to embrace &amp; walk in
the truth they do, or may see, as by the mercy of God, there is in me; which as I trust
it shalbe myne, so do I wish it may be their comfort also in the day of the Lord Iesus.</P>

<HI>would men should do vnto vs, even so to do to them, which is the Law, &amp; the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>I will therefore conclude this poynt with a double exhortation: the
former respecting vs our selves, who have (by the mercy of God) with the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7. 12.</NOTE>
fayth of Christ, receaved his order, &amp; ordinances: which is, that we please
not our selves therein too much, as if in them, piety, &amp; religion did chiefly
consist: which was not the least calamity of the Lords people of ould, for
which he also sharply reproved, &amp; severely punished them: of which evill, &amp;
overvaluation of these things (housoever great in themselvs) we are in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 40 6. 7. 8.</NOTE>
more daunger, considering our persequutions, &amp; sufferings for them: but
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hatas we believ these things are necessarily to be done, so we consider<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 16. 17. Ier. 7. 21. 22. Hos 6. Mic. 6. 7. 8.</NOTE>
that other things are not onely not to be left vndone, but to be done
much more. The grace of fayth in Christ, &amp; the fear of God, the continuall
renueing of our repentance, with love, mercy, humility, &amp; modesty, toge∣ther
with fervent prayer, &amp; hearty thanksgiveing vnto God, for his vnspeak∣cable
goodnes, are the things wherein especially we must serv God: nourish∣ing
them in our own hearts, &amp; so honoring them in others, wheresoever
they appear to dwell. And if God wilbe known, &amp; honoured in all his crea∣tures,
yea even in the sillyest worm that crawleth vppon the earth, how
much more in the holy graces of his spirit vouchsafed to his elect; notwith∣standing
theyr faylings of infirmity, especially in outward ordinances.
Which personall graces whilst too many have vndervalued in other men, &amp;
neglected in themselves, in comparison, God hath been provoked to suffer
so many amongst vs to fall, some into such personall sins, &amp; evilles (not∣withstanding
theyr advantage in the Lords ordinances) as from which
without these helpes) many thousands of them have been preserved: &amp;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers both from the conscience of Gods ordinances, &amp; of the personall
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leutyes of holines, &amp; honesty; as is generally to be seen in such, as have
made apostacy from theyr former profession with vs.</P>
<P>The other exhortation I direct vnto them about whom I deal: which is,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat they content not themselves with that fayth, &amp; grace in theyr persons,
which they have receaved, reiecting, or neglecting vnder any praetext, or ex∣cuse
whatsoever, the order, ordinances, &amp; institutions of the L: Iesus: in, by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he vse whereof, theyr fayth should be nourished in it self, &amp; manifested
vnto others: much more, that they continue not theyr submission to the
contrary, which is of Anti-Christ: lest God (besydes greater evilles) pu∣nish
them with yet greater confusion, &amp; bondage therin: that, vnder which
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are being such already, as (I suppose) I may truely affirm, that never
Church in the world, in which so many excellent truthes were taught, stood

how I can deem any the membres of such assemblyes, &amp; so practiseing, as truely Chri∣stian?
or how I can without pollution communicate with them, who are by the touch∣ing
of so many vnclean both persons, &amp; things, themselves made vnclean?</HI></P>
<P>For answer. First, it is true, that vppon the true Church the Scriptu∣res<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NSW.</NOTE>
do pronunce most excellent blessings; as they do also denounce fear∣full
curses vppon the false: as it is also true, that whatsoever is spoken of
the whole body, the one, or other, ioyntly, belongs to ech member of ey∣ther,
severally: provided, that in both, things be in theyr right state, &amp; or∣der:
which is, that there be none, but faythfull, &amp; holy persons in the
true Church, &amp; none but vnholy, &amp; prophane persons in the false: for none
other should be, in the one, or other. But if now it come to passe other∣wise,
&amp; that thorough the Churches want of Vigilancy or Zeal, &amp; the par∣tyes
hypocrisy (which hath been alwayes, &amp; is too too common) there
be in the true Church vnfaythfull, &amp; prophane persons, shall we say,
that those pretiouse promises made to the true Church in which they
wrongfully are, do apperteyn vnto them, &amp; vnto theyr persons? &amp; that
they are <HI>elect of God, saynts by calling,</HI> &amp; <HI>sanctifyed in Christ, to the hope of life,</HI> &amp;c.?
So if, on the contrary it come to passe, thorough her craft, &amp; cruelty, &amp;
theyr own weaknes (which is too too common also) that godly, &amp; fayth∣full
persons be in the false Church where they should not be, shall we now
lay vppon theyr persons all the curses, &amp; condemnation, which the Scrip∣tures
denounce agaynst the estate of the false Church, &amp; the superstitions
thereof? were not this to <HI>iustify the wicked,</HI> because he is in the true Church:
where he should not be? &amp; <HI>to condemn the righteouse</HI> because he is in the
false Church, where he should not be neyther? Or are not all godly wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
men in these, &amp; the like disordered states of things, to have vse of Chri∣stian
discretion for the putting of difference between person, &amp; person
notwithstanding theyr common Church state, &amp; order, the wicked with
the godly in the true Church, &amp; vnder Christs ordinances, &amp; the godly
with the wicked in the false Church vnder the forgeryes of Anti-Christ?
Otherwise our iudgment wilbe as confused, as is theyr estate. Neyther is it
a more difficult thing for a spirituall, &amp; vnpartiall ey to discern a godly man
in a false Ch: where the falsenes ariseth not from the falsity of fayth, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
order, &amp; ordinances, then to discern a wicked man in a true Church.</P>

And this consideration had, may serv for answer to the cheif part of
the obiection: which is also no more in effect, then hath been answered
by the Authours of † <HI>the Apology,</HI> before me, in theyr defence agaynst<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag 11</NOTE>
that vniust accusation layd vppon them by theyr adversaryes, that they af∣firmed
<HI>the whole Realm to be drowned in confusion without assurance of salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Theyr answer is, that <HI>there is difference to be put between</HI> PERSONS <HI>them∣selves,
&amp; between theyr</HI> ACTIONS <HI>or</HI> ESTATE <HI>otherwise. The person some∣times
is blessed, when the action, or standing in an other behalf, may be such as is
subiect to curse:</HI> &amp;c. <HI>As on the contrary also, sometymes the person is subiect to curse,
Qwhenas yet the action, or standing may be blessed in another respect.</HI> And both
those parts of theyr distinction they prove by sundry instāces from the Scri∣ptures.
Some whereof I will here note down, adding also some others
therevnto, for the confirmation of the first head of the distinction, which
more directly concerns the present question, which is about godly per∣sons
performing of, or standing in some corrupt, &amp; cursed actions, or estate
otherwise. Thus were <HI>Simeon, &amp; Levi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 49. 7. 28.</NOTE> both <HI>Blessed</HI> in theyr persons, &amp;

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyded, by Gods people.</P>
<P>And for the better discerning of things, it must be observed, that as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole Nation is devided into two Provinces, vnder the two Arch-Byshops,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the two Provinces into Sundry Diocesses, vnder the Byshops, &amp; they in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrish: as they do also vnto theyr Chauncelours, Commissaryes, &amp;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch-Deacons, an other part for inferiour government: reserving vnto
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves the Lordship over both, for the best advātage of theyr own ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our,
&amp; profit. So that the Chauncelour in the consistory, &amp; the preist in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Pulpit or Desk, doth administer by one, &amp; the same power: namely

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceav. And as Christ tould the twelv, when he sent them to preach, that

the Pope, that sent him; &amp; of whose sending the Pope is, they, &amp; we

God hath not planted,</HI> &amp; the ministery in the order, &amp; office, (of which we
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
speak) being a braunch of it, can the braunch survive, if the root be
plucked vp? or shall any of Gods people by their mayntenance of it,
submission vnto it, or communion with it, give therevnto any life, or pre∣servation?</P>
<P>But here sundry defences are made by them, who in iudgment, word,
&amp; wryteing, &amp; some practises, dislike the prelacy: as that <HI>they are not sub∣ject
to theyr government: that the Ministers do not stand by the ordination, &amp;
power receaved from, &amp; by them, but by the peoples acceptation: that these things
are but matters of outward order, &amp; government, which though they may so∣mething
concern the Ministers themselves, yet are they litle, or nothing to private
persons.</HI></P>
<P>We will breifly consider of these defences: &amp; let them who make them,
consider, &amp; beware, they be not of them, who <HI>will not be reformed, but seck
excuses aster theyr own heart.</HI></P>
<P>And, first, they who thus disclaym in word the Byshops government,
confesse themselves therein to be vnder no spirituall externall govern∣ment
at all: &amp; so be lawles persons, &amp; inordinate walkers, &amp; such as
have neyther that conscience, which is meet, of the Commaundements of
Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Tim. 5. 17. Hebr. 13. 17.</NOTE> by his Apostles, to give due <HI>honour</HI> to them who <HI>rule well:</HI> &amp; to <HI>sub∣mit
themselves to these, who are over them in the Lord:</HI> nor of their own frayl∣ty,
&amp; in what need they stand of the Lords ordinances, &amp; of this in spe∣ciall,
for their guidance, &amp; conservation in his wayes. 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, the dayly
practise of these men (every one of them lesse or more) in the sight of
the Sun, is a sufficient conviction of their vnhonest excuse. Their Obe∣dience
vnto the Summons, &amp; Citations (vnto their spirituall Courts) of
the Prelates, &amp; their Deputyes; their sueing, or appearing there by them∣selves,
or their proctours; the submission of the Ministers to their suspen∣sions,
&amp; deprivations, &amp; both of Ministers, &amp; people to their excommu∣nications,
do really plead their spirituall subjection to their Iurisdiction.
Yea so far are the people from freing the Ministers by theyr acceptation,
from the Prelates iurisdiction, as on the contrary, they enthrall them
much more vnder the same: not onely by accepting them at the first
vnder their <HI>mark</HI> of Institution, or licence, but even ever after, year, by

<P>Now for the outward government, &amp; ordering of the house of God, the
Church; &amp; the outward calling of the Ministers thereof, they are not so
sleighty matters, as Politique men, out of theyr fleshly hearts would per∣swade
themselves &amp; others. The Apostle vnto Tim: treating at larg of
these things tels him, how the <HI>cause</HI> why he so <HI>wrytes</HI> is, that in his <HI>absence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 3. v. 15. 16.</NOTE>
he <HI>might know how he ought to behave himself, in the house of God, which is the
Ch: of the liveing God, the piller, &amp; ground of truth.</HI> Where he adorneth the
Church with most honourable titles, for this very end, that he, &amp; all other
Gods Ministers, &amp; people might be admonished more carefully to preserv
vnviolated that sacred oeconomy, &amp; Ch: government there prescribed:

of it, <HI>then was Moses a servant in his Maysters house:</HI> according to
whose direction notwithstanding, all things were to be ordered. I ad,
that the same Apostle, (whatsoever other men despiseing (it seems) his
simplicity, think or say) testifyeth of the <HI>Colossians,</HI> that they had <HI>receaved

arrogateing to himself to be vniversall Byshop, is in it self but a matter of

deem him properly Anti-Christ therein: alledging that of <HI>Gregory</HI> agaynst

<P>Now touching the Ministers outward calling: of such force it is, that
he is by it alone (if at all) properly, &amp; immediately, a true Church of∣ficer;

<P>And, as they know who have experience thereof, what confort it mi∣nistereth

Christ, that they are called by them therevnto, whom vnder the Lord i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
most concerneth, as over whose Soules they are to watch: so on the con∣trary,
I verily suppose, it cometh to passe, that even the best Ministers in the
assemblyes, do so easily, &amp; vnworthily forsake theyr flockes, for theyr grea∣ter
ease, profit, or credit; &amp; which not, for fear of a litle persequution? be∣cause
they want this testimony, &amp; comfort of good conscience, that they
have been lawfully called to minister vnto them.</P>
<P>To conclude then this poynt also: the same Scriptures, &amp; ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which prove the order of prelacy, &amp; so of preisthood, (being a braunch o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>For 1. theyr very administrations by an vnlawfull calling are theyr sins <MILESTONE N="I"/>

they frō giving vnto Christ his due honour in his officers, &amp; orders, whilst
they thus submit vnto the officers, &amp; orders of his adversary Anti-Christ,
as is that whole Hierarchy &amp; every order in it, from the Pope vnto the
Sumner. If any traytour, or rebell should now rise vp, &amp; strive with the
king for any the dignityes or prerogatives royall of the kingdom, &amp; should
so far prevayl with any able men, as that they should be content to take vp∣pon

were it lawfull for any the kings subiects to ioyn with, or submit vnto them

<P><PB N="35" REF="22"/>
Touching the 2d Argument: I deny the proportion vppon which they
build it. In receaving an admonition from an vnlawfull brother, (as they
speak) I do submit onely to that which is good in it self, &amp; of God: but
in submitting to an vnlawfull Officer, Prelate or Preist, I submit to that
which is evill in it self &amp; not of God, to wit, his very Office, or Order.
The vnlawfull brother, though in sin, yet doth not perform the admoni∣tion
by vertue of his sin, but out of his personall knowledg, &amp; Zeal (at
least in appearance) agaynst the sin he reproves in particular, but the vn∣lawfull
Officer doth administer the publique doctrine, (as the Sacraments)
by vertue, or rayther by vice, of his very sin immediately, &amp; properly:
wherein I may not pertake with him. These men have refused to submit
to <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Iohnsons</HI> publique Ministery, &amp; so professe: do they therfore think it
Vnlawfull to receav any information, or admonition, or reproof by the
word of God for their sins, from him, or any the people with him priva∣tely,
&amp; vppon occasion? And by their larg grounds it should be lawfull
to submit to the ministery of any hereticall Minister: for from such a one
it is not vnlawfull to receav a private admonition for sin, vppon occasion.
But how much better were it for these men, &amp; their freinds to advance by
all good means a lawfull Ministery, then thus to supporte that which is vn∣lawfull,
by pleading for submission vnto it. But if they needs will, (as
they plead in their book submit their soules to <HI>theeves, &amp; robbers,</HI> &amp; to
such Ministers, as were the <HI>Scribes,</HI> &amp; <HI>Pharisees</HI> in Christes tyme, (in
whom they instance) notorious Heretiques denying both the nature,
Offices, &amp; Person of the Messiah, teaching iustification by the works
of the law, &amp; power in man to keep it, let them <HI>reioyce</HI> in their Mi∣nisters,
&amp; let their Ministers <HI>also reioyce</HI> in them, as <HI>Iotham</HI> sayd of <HI>the
men of Schechem,</HI> &amp; <HI>Abimelech:</HI> but for vs, we have learnt to give
more honour to Gods ordinance, &amp; to have more care of Christs pre∣tious
purchase, our souls, then to commit the same to such watch∣mens
keeping.</P>
<P>Thus have I breifly noted down, &amp; confirmed the principall grounds
of our separation from the Communion, &amp; order of the Ch: assemblyes,
notwithstanding the admission of the personall communion before men∣tioned.
And I have of purpose taken in, &amp; answered the cheif Reasons
brought by <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Cluses</HI> accusers, agayust our practise, that it may appear,
both how they fayl of that they promise in the <HI>Preface</HI> of their book; as
also that it is a far more easy thing, to reproach mens persons, then iust∣ly
to evince their profession. And would the king but give toleration, &amp;
with-hould from bodly violence agaynst their persons &amp; estates, I doubt
not, but we should have many thousands in the land concurring with is,
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>
for substance of practise, as they do now in opinion: who would speedily
vnite themselves in other spirituall societyes, then the prophane parrishes:
leaving the service book, &amp; Ceremonyes, to the Prelates, with theyr dumb
prcists, &amp; formall Clergy: withdrawing from their, &amp; their Chauncelours,
&amp; Officials spirituall jurisdiction, neyther obeying their Summons, nor
regardeing their Censures: neyther would the Ministers sue to them for
their Orders, &amp; Licences; not the people receav them of their makeing,
nor present them by their Ch: wardens to their Courts, nor keep them by
their leav, &amp; vnder their correction: but both Ministers, &amp; people would
fynde other, &amp; better Rules of direction in Christs testament, for their
walking, &amp; worshipping of God, then the Byshops Canons, &amp; Iniunctions.

<P>Now touching our Cuntry, &amp; freinds, our answer is, that we deem the

Yet for our Cuntry, we do not forsake it, but are by it forsaken &amp; expelled
by most extream lawes, &amp; violent proscriptions contrived, &amp; exequuted
by the Prelates, &amp; on their behalf. And for private freinds thus we iudg:
that the wife is no way to leav her housband, but to give him, as the head,
the honour of chuseing probabely, the place of they cohabitation: nor
Children, &amp; Servants theyr Parents, &amp; Maysters to their preiudice, without
their consent, or an apparent impossibility of doeing them service: nor
at all, where thorough their absence, they shall want necessary help, &amp; com∣fort.

drawing them. The truth is, it was <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helwisse,</HI> who above all eyther

disabled himself, that naturall confidence, which abounded in him, tooke
occasion, vnder an appearance of spirituall courage, to presse him vppon
those desperate courses, which he, of late, hath run. By which he might
also think it his glory do dare, &amp; chaleng king, &amp; state to their faces, &amp; not

for Gods glory, &amp; the good of men, especially of our family, &amp; those nea∣rest

new outward washing (which we neyther think, nor he proves) it being
but our fayling of ignorance in an outward ordinance, were we thereby
debarred from being true Christians, no nor from being a true visible

<P>And as I have els where proved agaynst others (with whom these men

not gathered by baptism.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"/><HI>3<SUP>dly</SUP>,</HI> If men be receaved into the Ch: by baptism, them must they, as
occasion is, be cast out, by being vnbaptized: &amp; so if God agayn give them
repentance, they must be receaved in by a 2d baptism, &amp; so by a 3d, or 4th,
if occasion be. The truth is, such men must renue their Covenant with
God, &amp; his Ch: by which they were at the first receaved; but not their
outward baptism, vnto which these, &amp; other mens fancy leadeth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="IIII"/><HI>4<SUP>thly</SUP>,</HI> to receav in, &amp; so to cast out members, are dispensations of Christs

former Ch: state, &amp; ministery, came together to erect a new Ch: by ba∣ptism:
vnto which they also ascribed so great vertue, as that they would
not so much as pray together, before they had it. And after some strey∣ning
of courtesy, who should begin, &amp; that of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> Math: 3. 14. mis∣alledged,
<HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Smith</HI> baptized first himself, &amp; next <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helwis,</HI> &amp; so the rest,

we put of things: bewraying playnly therein his tumultuons ignorance, by
which he would confound, &amp; blunder all things together: whereas there is

<P>And haveing spent his breath in reproaching our distinctions of <HI>true, false</HI>
&amp; <HI>none,</HI> he for our conviction begins with a distinction of <HI>worldly things:</HI> in
which he graunts a <HI>difference between false &amp; none:</HI> as that there is a <HI>false hower-glasse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 134</NOTE>
&amp; <HI>no hower-glasse, a false looking-glasse,</HI> &amp; <HI>no looking-glasse,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>whereas, in the

<HI>eyes in theyr heads,</HI> a <HI>looking-glasse,</HI> wherein both the il-favoured face of his

<P>The vse of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>a looking-glasse</HI> is to shew <HI>what manner the native face of a man is.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 23. 24.</NOTE>
And the reason why we call such a one <HI>false,</HI> is, because it doth not that in
truth, which it makes shew of, but deceaves him that looks in it, for the fa∣shion,
&amp; portrature of his countenāce. So the vse of an <HI>hower-glasse</HI> is to shew
when the hower is iust come about: which we therefore call false, when it
doth not so indeed, but deceavs him that looks vnto it, eyther by running
short, or over. Hence common sense teacheth, that if there may be a Ch: or
assembly, of people makeing a profession, &amp; shew of Christ, &amp; Christian bap∣tism,
&amp; religion, but not being, &amp; haveing that indeed, which in shew, &amp; ap∣pearance
it seems to be, &amp; have, &amp; so but deceaving him that regards it, then
may there also be, &amp; so rightly be called, a false Ch:. If reply be made, that
this false Ch: is no Ch:, it may as truely be answered, that that false hower-glasse
is no hower-glasse: as in truth, &amp; indeed, it is not an hower-glasse, but
a three, or five-quarters-glasse, or over, or vnder. It is evident by the same
common Reason of both, that there may be as well <HI>a false Church,</HI> which is
not <HI>no Church,</HI> as <HI>a false looking,</HI> or <HI>hower-glasse,</HI> which are <HI>not none:</HI> &amp; other

The consideration of <HI>one God,</HI> &amp; <HI>one Christ,</HI> is something different, but di∣rectly
agaynst these men: for there may be, &amp; are assemblyes of false wor∣shippers,
of this one God, &amp; one Christ: &amp; therefore false Churches, &amp; so
their Sacraments accordingly false Sacraments.</P>
<P>And thus much to shew how vayn his distinction is between Gods or∣dinances,

as he applyeth it: &amp; to prove, that <HI>false</HI> may as well, &amp; by the same reason
be applyed to the outward ordinances of the Church, as vnto worldly
things: as also to answer the Scriptures he brings to disprove that part of
our distinction, touching a <HI>false Church.</HI> It now remayns I prove by the

Churches,</HI> &amp; false <HI>Ch: ordinances:</HI> &amp; that such a Church the <HI>ten tribes</HI> were in

&amp; appearance of that which it is not, (as the knowledg of three Latin

there are too many, which vnder a profession of the name, &amp; sundry
truthes, &amp; ordinances of Christ, do deceav; it followeth necessarily, that
there maybe, &amp; are, <HI>false Churches.</HI> And thus much in effect he graunts els

for he knowes <HI>the Prophets,</HI> or teachers teach, &amp; the people with them, <HI>pro∣fesse</HI>

<P>There was at that tyme but one onely true visible Ch:: one temple, one <MILESTONE N="IIII"/>
preisthood, one altar, one sacrifice, one kingdom of the Lord, in the hands of

<P>Lastly, the Covenant with Araham on Gods part was, that he would be

<HI>without the true God.</HI> By which it appeareth, that Israell, was without the
Lords Covenant: &amp; that vnto them Circumcision could not possibly be a
signe, that God was their God. It was by them merely vsurped, &amp; in
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>
that their vsurpation, a false, &amp; lying signe, &amp; like a seal set to a blank, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

nor with any other of Gods ordinances. Their ‡ <HI>sacrificeing of a lamb,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. 66. 3.</NOTE>
was <HI>as if they had cut of a dogs neck:</HI> &amp; so consequently their circumciseing
their children, as if they had cut the foreskin of their dogs: notwithstan∣ding
they were true Israelites, yea true Iewes, naturally. They were ex∣presly
forbidden by the Lord to medle with his Covenant; &amp; in that their
abuse of it, it was a lying signe in the ends, &amp; vses thereof, &amp; no way af∣foarding
that, which it pretended: neyther could they so vseing it, be by
it, at all confirmed, that God was their God. And yet was not the out∣ward
cutting afterwards to be repeated, if God gave repentance: neyther
is the outward washing in the name of the trinity now, though merely vsur∣ped
by them, who are forbidden to medle with it. Neyther matters it,
whether such persons be in true Church, or false, which <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> calles
none. Both prophane, &amp; vsurp it, &amp; have the bare outward lying signe, as
it is sayd of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> or <HI>Israell,</HI> that she <HI>compassed about the Lord with lyes, &amp;
deceipt:</HI> whereas <HI>Iudah ruled with God, &amp; was faythfull with the most Holy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos 11. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>But for conclusion of this poynt. If any of the heathen ioyned them∣selves
vnto Israell in her Apostacy, &amp; so were Circumcised, they being ney∣ther
<HI>Abrahams true seed,</HI> by nature, nor by fayth, but merely false, &amp; coun∣terfayt,
their Circumcision must be false Circumcision by <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> his
own graunt: which notwithstanding was not afterwards to be repeated, if
God gave them repentance, &amp; to come to Iudah to eat the passover. There
was <HI>one law for the eating of the passover, to him that was home-born, &amp; to him that</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE>
<HI>was a straunger,</HI> or <HI>soiourner.</HI> And here appeareth a direct warrant for our re∣teyning
the outward Baptism, receaved, &amp; vsurped, in the like apostate
estate, &amp; assemblyes, wherein they, &amp; their familyes, &amp; synagogues were.</P>
<P>I ad, that eyther the outward baptism receaved out of a true Ch: must be
reteyned, or els all other Churches must be able certaynly to discern, what
day, &amp; hour a true Ch: falling by degrees, into notorious heresy, idolatry,
or other impiety, (&amp; still baptizeing notwithstanding) becomes a false
Ch: (as we hould) or (as <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> will have it) no Church. For except
other Churches can certaynly know, &amp; discern this, they cannot with fayth
receav such members, as vnto whom God may give grace, to leav th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
apostate synagogue, &amp; to come vnto them. Such of them, as were baptized,
whilst it remayned a true Ch: they must not rebaptize: but such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
were baptized after it ceased to be a true Ch: must (say our adversaryes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
be receaved in by baptism. But it being impossible for other Church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>
thus to discern of the day, &amp; hour of the removeing of a Churches Candle∣stick,
especially for such as are far of, &amp; have had litle, or no medling with
her, it followeth necessarily, that the outward baptism administred in a Ch:
or assembly degenerated from a true Ch: into a false, (which they call no)
Church, must be reteyned vppon the partyes repentance, without reite∣ration.</P>
<P>For conclusion then of this poynt also, I demaund, whether a man cast
out of the true Ch: for some notorious sin, &amp; for impenitency therein, have
true baptism, or no? They will not, neyther can they, say, he hath, wryte∣ing
of it, as they do: neyther indeed hath he true Bapt: in the ends, &amp; vses
thereof. He must then eyther have a false baptism, or none. Not none, for
then vppon his repentance, &amp; readmission into the Ch: he must be rebap∣tized:
he hath therefore vppon him a false baptism. There is then (con∣trary
to their doctrine) <HI>false Baptism,</HI> which is not none, &amp; the same also to
be reteyned, &amp; by the persons repentance becomeing <HI>true Baptism.</HI> Neyther
matters it, that such a man was baptized in a true Ch: at the first, since by
his<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Rom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 25.</NOTE> <HI>transgression</HI> his <HI>Circumcision</HI> is <HI>made vncircumcision.</HI> In his obstinate ini∣quity
he cannot enioy the fruit, or benefit of his baptism: which serveth
onely to make him the more inexcusable, &amp; a more prophane Covenant∣breaker
with God. He hath onely remayning the outward washing, &amp;
that much more without right, then many thousands in Engl: have, or in
Rome eyther.</P>
<P>And thus much for the iustifying of the difference in the Apology, be∣tween
a <HI>true, false,</HI> &amp; <HI>no Church,</HI> &amp; Sacraments; as also for the applying of
the same distinction to our present occasion.</P>
<P>The particulars following in his book do more specially concern my self,
&amp; wryteings: agaynst whom, &amp; which, (thorough high perswasion of his
own knowledg, &amp; most vnmortifyed affections, together with that <HI>Zeal of
God▪ which I bear him record he had, though not accordeing vnto knowledg</HI>) he let∣teth
loose his tongue into most intemperate rage</P>
<P>And first he reproacheth me for the vse of that, for the want whereof I
have iust cause to blame my self: which is my <HI>Logick,</HI> &amp; <HI>Philosophy</HI> as being<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>
<HI>none of the gif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, wherewith Christ endued his Apostles:</HI> wherein he verifyeth the
ould saving, that, <HI>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owledg hath no enemy but ignorance. Logick</HI> is nothing but
the right vse of reason: as is <HI>Philosophy</HI> the love of wisdome divine, &amp; hu∣mayn.
And did the Apostles want these? Or doth <HI>M<SUP>•</SUP> Helw.</HI> envy vnto
me my small pittance in them? Would he have me a new <HI>Nebuchad-nezzar,</HI>
with an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s heart</HI> in a mans body? Indeed this his iudgment agaynst those
arts of wisdom, &amp; reason, well agrees with his ignorant, &amp; bruteish deal∣ing
agaynst me, &amp; the truth. And for my <HI>terms of art,</HI> (which he also blameth)
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
they are neyther many, nor without cause: nor yet so dark, but that an or∣dinary
Reader may, as they are explaned by me, vnderstand them.</P>
<P>But I come to the poynts themselves, agaynst which he dealeth: the
first whereof is <HI>a double consideration</HI> I put <HI>of Baptism:</HI> the one takeing it, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>Agaynst the former of these respects <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw: speaks angerly,</HI> as himself

signe of the inward: the other the <HI>Baptism with the H. Ghost,</HI> wherewith onely
Christ, &amp; God do baptize: as there is in like manner, an outward teaching
by the word, &amp; an inward teaching by the spirit: an outward eating of the
Lords supper in the vse of the signes, &amp; an inward eating of the thing, by
fayth in the heart. And even this outward washing with water in the name of
the Trinity, (which he calles <HI>water, washing,</HI> &amp; <HI>words</HI>) is in it self a spirituall or∣dinance
(though he take the contrary for graunted) as being properly sub∣ordinate
to mans spirituall estate, &amp; appoynted of God to signify, &amp; con∣firm
the inward washing of the soul by the blood, &amp; spirit of Christ.</P>
<P>And this ground layd, I graunt, first, that the outward, &amp; inward bap∣tism
are ioyned together by Christ, &amp; so ought not by men to be separated,
but ioyned together in their tyme, &amp; order: but deny, that therefore where
the inward baptism by the spirit is not actually manifested, as in the Infants
of beleevers, there the outward is not to be ministred: or that being admi∣nistred
vnlawfully in apostate Churches, it is no outward Baptism at all,
nor spirituall in it self, (though carnally vsed) nor to be held vppon repen∣tance,
without repetition.</P>
<P>The outward <HI>Circumcision</HI> of the flesh, &amp; the inward <HI>Circumcision in the
heart,</HI> which it signifyed, &amp; whereof it did admonish the Circumcised, were<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 10. 16.</NOTE>

it? Or being prophanely administred amongst the idolatrous, &amp;
apostate Israelites, or to the idolatrous Proselites amongst them, did their
abuse chaung the nature of it in it self? Or was it no Circumcision at all, &amp;
so to be repeated, when the Lord vouchsafed to ad the Circumcision of the
heart?</P>

man professing the same fayth with them in holines outwardly, but in hy∣pocrisy,
should be baptized by them: &amp; that afterwards his heart should
strike him, &amp; God give him true repentance, (let it be the person they
know of, that fled from vs vnder admonition for sin, &amp; ioyning to, &amp; being
baptized by them, was presently after by themselves found in the same sin,
&amp; so Censured) whether, I say, they would repeat their outward washing
formerly made, as none, because there was not ioyned with it the inward
washing of the Spirit? Or if they think it none, &amp; so the fore mentioned
person not indeed receaved in by baptism, as they speak, wherefore did
they then excommunicate the same person?</P>
<P>I conclude therefore, that there is an <HI>outward baptism by water,</HI> &amp; an <HI>in∣ward
baptism by the spirit:</HI> which though they ought not to be severed, in
their tyme, by Gods appoyntment, yet many tymes are by mens default:
that, the outward <HI>baptism in the name of the Father, Son, &amp; H. Ghost,</HI> admini∣stered
in an apostate Church, is false baptism in the administration, &amp; yet
in it self, &amp; own nature, a Spirituall ordinance, though abused: &amp; whose
spirituall vses cannot be had without repentance: by which repentance,
&amp; the after baptism of the spirit it is sanctifyed, &amp; not to be repeated.</P>
<P>The 2<SUP>d</SUP> parte of the distinction followeth, which respects the manner of
administering the outward ordinance of Baptism: &amp; namely <HI>the person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y

repentance, that so they might have the sanctifyed vse of those very holy
things by them formely abused so vnholily. These our adversaryes do not
iustify their mariages in the assemblyes, celebrated by the parish preist, as

leaf, I affirm, that if any <HI>parts of the Scriptures,</HI> or ther particulars agreable
therevnto, or any forms of <HI>prayers</HI> conteyned therein, be by them vttered
vppon the stage, they still remayn in themselves, &amp; own nature, the truthes
of God, &amp; forms of prayers conceaved by holy men, yea their prayers, not∣withstanding
that sinfull prophanation of them: although that vttering of
them be nothing lesse, then true preaching or true praying. So may there
be, &amp; is too commonly, true outward baptism, that is, the very outward
thing for substance done, where there is no true baptizeing, that is, no
true, &amp; lawfull manner of administering it. And if the <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing with water in
the name of the Father, Son, &amp; H. Ghost,</HI> of a fit person, by a lawfull Minister,

then is <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing with water in the name of the Father, Son, &amp; H. Ghost,</HI>
by an vnlawfull Minister, of an vnfit subiect, &amp; in an vnsanctifyed commu∣nion,
&amp; manner, true baptism vnlawfully, &amp; falsely administered. The
thing done is the same in both: the difference is onely in the manner of
doeing it.</P>
<P>But between the baptism of a Turk vppon a Turk, &amp; of a midwife, I
put this difference: that whereas that of a Turk is not done as a religious
action, but merely in mockery, (as is that of <HI>a Childe,</HI> in sporte) the latter
by a midwife is performed as a religious action vppon a member of an apo∣state
Church: of which there is therefore another consideration to be had,
then of that which is done in sporte, &amp; mockery, which common sence
teacheth to be as nothing: as we may see in an oath, which being taken in
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
ieast byndeth not at all, but if taken in earnest, &amp; for a thing lawfull,
(though prophanely) byndeth him that took it.</P>
<P>For the shutting vp then of this poynt, let the Reader observ, that the
Baptism which we repeat not, is that, which hath been ministered vppon
the members, &amp; accordeing to the order (how corrupt soever) of such a
Church, as wherein the Lord hath his people, &amp; for their sakes, many
his truthes, &amp; ordinances, which he so far blesseth vnto his elect, as by
them (notwithstanding all the confusion there,) he doth communicate,
&amp; confirm his saveing grace vnto them. Of the number of which his elect,
we have also (by his grace) testifyed our selves to be, as otherwise, so in
particular, by <HI>comeing</HI> as <HI>his people out of Babilon,</HI> or confusion, at his call. And
we rayther think it our duety to acknowledg the great goodnes of God
towards vs, in passing by the sins of our ignorance, &amp; in blessing vnto vs,
what was of himself, &amp; his own there: then vnthankfully to disclaym the
least eyther inward work of his grace, or outward means by which he
wrought it.</P>
<P>In the next place <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> rayseth himself vppon his tiptoes, &amp; in
vayn confidence of his mighty strength, threatneth teribly to <HI>strike</HI> me <HI>with
a rod of iron, &amp; to break me in peices like a potters vessell.</HI> And because he chuseth
as his ground of best advantage, a poynt of our profession, viz: that <HI>Bap∣tism
comes in the stead of Circumcision,</HI> which yet neyther he, nor they with
him, will in an other case acknowledg, I will therefore in the first place
prove that ground, by the Scriptures, &amp; reasons vnto them agreable, &amp; so
come to warde his so sore threatned stroak.</P>
<P>And, first, <HI>the Apostle</HI> disswadeing the <HI>Colossians</HI> from Iewish Ceremo∣nyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h. 2. v. 8 10. 11.</NOTE>
&amp; in speciall from <HI>Circumcision,</HI> teacheth them, that <HI>in Christs</HI> person
<HI>dwelleth all fulnes:</HI> &amp; that <HI>in him</HI> as <HI>the head</HI> thereof, <HI>the Church</HI> hath <HI>all perfe∣ction:</HI>
who <HI>by his Circumcision</HI> hath abolished the former, as the shadow by
the substance: <HI>by whom</HI> also, &amp; whose <HI>circumcision</HI> the faythfull have their
<HI>hearts circumcised.</HI> But whereas it might be obiected, that faythfull <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
had his heart circumcised, &amp; yet he had withall the outward signe, &amp;
seal annexed; the Apostle answereth v. 12. That they are baptized into
Christ: (the effects of which bapt: he also noteth down in the same place)
&amp; therefore needed not circumcision, as the false Apostles bore them in
hand: therein directly teaching, that our <HI>Bapt:</HI> is instead of their <HI>circumci∣sion:</HI>
as is also our <HI>L: Supper</HI> instead of their <HI>passover:</HI> which supper no vn∣baptized
person may eat of, as could no man vncircumcised eat of the pas∣sover.
Their circumcision was not to be repeated, nor our baptism now,
though our eating the L: Supper be, as their passover also was Likewise the
Israelites in the wildernes wanting the ordinary Sacraments of Circumcis:
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
&amp; the passover, &amp; haveing instead of them the extraordinary Sacraments of
<HI>baptism in the sea and cloud,</HI> &amp; of <HI>Manna,</HI> &amp; <HI>the rock;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c.</NOTE> &amp; that baptism signifying
our baptism now, &amp; that <HI>Manna,</HI> &amp; <HI>water of the rock,</HI> the the Sacrament of <HI>the
body, &amp; blood of Christ</HI> now: it is evident that our baptism cometh instead of
their circumcision. Besydes Circumcision was their first, &amp; solemn ordināce
of initiation, or enterāce, by which (say our adversaryes) they were receaved
into the Ch: So is Bapt: our first, &amp; solemn ordināce of initiation, by which
also (say they) men are receaved into the Ch: now. How then do not they
succeed one another, as doth the Ch: now the Ch: then?</P>
<P>Lastly their Circumcision then was a signe or seal of the Covenant of
God; so is our Baptism now of the same Covenant, as shalbe proved here∣after:
their circumcis: admonisheing them of that originall corruption of
all that came naturally of Adam, not to be purged but with the shedding
of the blood of the promised seed: as doth also our baptism admonish vs
of our originall spirituall filthines, not to be washed away but by the blood
of Christ powred vppon vs: the same outward circumcis: yet further signi∣fying
the inward circumcis: of the heart, as doth our bapt: with water the
inward baptism of the spirit; which circumcision was also vnto them a
note or badg of distinction from the world, as is also bapt: now; though
by many vsurped, as that also then was.</P>
<P>This ground then being cleared, I come to that which must strike this
stroke so terribly threatned: which is, that <HI>in my graunteing, &amp; proveing in my</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE>
<HI>book, that Rome, &amp; England were never in the Covenant of God, as Iudah was, I do
therefore debar my self from bringing my baptism from apostate Israell; &amp; therefore must
prove, that Circumcision, (&amp; so Baptism) receaved in a Babilonish assembly, by a
Babilonian, vppon a Babilonian, might be reteyned: &amp; a man so circumcised, eat the
passover</HI>▪ to disprove this he quotes Ezra 10. 3. &amp; Nehem: 13. 23. 24. 25. <HI>for the
putting away of childrē</HI> (though circūcised) <HI>born of the strange wives in Babilon.</HI></P>
<P>I professe, as before, that neyther the Catholick (so called) Church of<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANSW.</NOTE>
Rome, consisting of many cuntryes, &amp; nations, nor the nationall Ch: of
Engl: was ever within the Covenant of the gospell, or new Testament, (as
was <HI>Iudah,</HI> &amp; with her Israell before the division) notwithstāding eyther the
particular holy persons that are, or particular Churches which happily have
been there Neyther of both therefore sayth <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> can be <HI>apostate Israell,</HI>
which was before her apostacy the true Ch: or of it, by our graunt. I deny
the consequence; &amp; his ignorāce it is to think, that onely they can be <HI>apostate
Israell;</HI> who were formerly of Iudah. For then such of the heathen, as ioyned
to Israell in her apostacy, were not of <HI>apostate Israell,</HI> because they or their
parents were never of Iudah. And by his ground neyther the nationall
English, nor Catholick Romish Church should be Anti-Christian,
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
for neyther of both were ever <HI>the temple of God,</HI> in which Antichrist at first
raysed himself. But as they are Apostolick Churches, which have receaved<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thess 2</NOTE>
&amp; do keep the fayth, &amp; order delivered by the Apostles, though the Apostles
did not gather them personally: so are they answerably <HI>Apostaticall Churches,</HI>
which have taken vp, &amp; receaved an Apostaticall state, &amp; condition from
others, though they were never true in themselvs: the rule of nature here
haveing place, which is that <HI>the accessory followeth the nature of the principall.</HI>
We do likewise most properly, &amp; immediately call that a schismaticall
Church, which was once eyther of, or a true Church, &amp; hath causelesly
made a division: but yet if any other assembly (though haveing never been
of, or a true Church) do take vp a schismaticall profession, &amp; walking,
even it is also, though secondarily, a schismaticall Ch: &amp; so to be reputed.
So that, though Engl: never was eyther in the whole Nation, or severall
parrishes, a true visible Church, or Churches, yet haveing taken vp the
Apostate Communion, worship, government, Ministery &amp; order of Rome,
with the doctrines which defend them; &amp; Rome of that particular Church,
which was once planted there, haveing degenerated by degrees from the
primative constitution, it is truely called by vs <HI>Apostate Israell,</HI> for the pur∣pose
in hand: &amp; that outward baptism there receaved, rightly by vs re∣teyned,
as was the outward Circumcision in Apostate Israell of ould.</P>
<P>The Scriptures he brings, which are Ezra 10. 3. Nehem. 13. 23. 24. 25.
make much agaynst him in the generall cause, &amp; nothing for him in the par∣ticular.</P>
<P>For to let passe other oversights. 1. They prove, that to be of Abrahams
seed carnally was not enough to make one a member of the Church, &amp;
within the L: Covenant of Circumcision. For these very children thus <HI>put
away</HI> (as haveing no parte therein) were, &amp; so are by <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> acknow∣ledged,
<HI>the males of the Israelites.</HI> 2. If any of them thus <HI>put away,</HI> had after∣wards
chosen the L: God of Israell to be theyr God, should they have
been recircumcised? Or is there in the Scriptures any sillabe tending that
way? 3. He is vtterly deceaved in saying those <HI>children were born in Babilon:</HI>
vppon which notwithstanding he layeth all the weight of his Argument.
They were born in Canaan, &amp; of the wives of the peoples nere adioyning,
as in the same places is expressed: &amp; so their Circumcision nothing at all
to the Circumcision ministred in Babilon: &amp; yet is he more peremptory
in this his errour, then a wise man would be in the truth. And thus all may
see how his <HI>rod of iron</HI> is proved a broken reed, whose shivers have peirced
his own hands</P>
<P>The next thing he comes to, is, that other ground of ours (for with
his by-bablings, &amp; revyleings I will neyther trouble my self, nor the Reader)
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>
thus by him related, that <HI>Baptism is the vessell of the Lords house; &amp; as when the

though prophaned by Baltezar, &amp; being brought agayn out of Babilon to the house of
the Lord, were not to be new cast, but (being purifyed) might agayn be vsed to holy
vse: so this holy vessell of Bapt: though prophaned, in Babilon, being brought agayn to
the house of the Lord, remaynes still the holy vessell of the L: house.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Agaynst this he alledgeth. 1. That</HI> our baptism (seing it was administred<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Helw▪</NOTE>

the applying, &amp; vseing of it being formerly moulded, &amp; made: &amp; this com∣mon
sence teacheth: otherwise there should be a new vessell made &amp; moul∣ded,

vse of it being purifyed by repentance.</P>
<P>More particularly. If <HI>the true doctrine of Bapt:</HI> be <HI>the vessell of the Lords house,</HI>
then cannot this vessell of the Lords house be brought out of the mother
<HI>Babilon,</HI> which Rome is: because the doctrine of Bapt: there is most false
in it self: as that, <HI>Bapt: doth by the very work done, confer grace, &amp; wholy abolish
originall sin:</HI> that it <HI>imprinteth in the soul of the baptized a character, or mark indeli∣ble,
by which even the damned in hell, which have been baptized, are differenced from
the vnbaptized:</HI> that it is <HI>of absolute necessity to salvation:</HI> that <HI>such infants are to be
baptized as neyther of whose parents are sanctifyed, or faythfull:</HI> &amp; that it is <HI>onely to
be administred by the popes annoynted ones, save in case of necessity, &amp; that then the
midwife may do it,</HI> with the like. How then can the vessell of the doctrine of
true baptism be brought from Babilon, where it is not? And so far as the
doctrine is true, so far the baptism is true also, being administred accor∣deing
vnto it.</P>
<P>The truth then is, that as there were in the materiall temple both the
vessels, &amp; doctrine, teaching their vse, so is there by proportion in the Ch:
now, the vessell of baptism, or thing ordeyned, (which is most properly
called the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Lev. 3▪ 17.</NOTE> ordinance) &amp; the doctrine ordeyning, &amp; teaching it: which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13▪ 1. 2.</NOTE>
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
are two severall things in all mens eyes which have sight in them. And
since baptism administred, besydes the doctrine which teacheth it, is ap∣poynted
of God, as a means, to signify, &amp; apply the blood, &amp; spirit of
Christ thereby signifyed, it is very absurd to deny it to be a vessell for the
service of the Lords house, &amp; of the holy things therein: rightly vsed in the
temple: vsurped in Babilon, or els where.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Smith,</HI> &amp; <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> with him in their <HI>Character,</HI> confesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 58.</NOTE>
that <HI>if the Anti-Christians had baptized persons, confessing their sins, &amp; theyr fayth
into the name of the sonne of God, &amp; the trinity, it had been true baptism, though
in the hands of the Anti-Christians, as the vessels of the L: house in the hands of
the Chaldeant, &amp; therefore needed not repetition, as the vessels needed no new casting:</HI>
therein acknowledging, not the doctrine, but the outward washing in the
name of the trinity to be the vessell of the L: house in Babilon: as also
that there might be baptism so far true without eyther lawfull commu∣nion,
minister, or subiect, (for all are Anti-Christian) as that it might be
reteyned without repetition: which is also iustly proved from Circumci∣sion,
administred in a prophane vsurping family (though naturally Israeli∣tish)

society. But that good, whether in persons, or things, which Sathan hath
not had power to destroy, he hath laboured to confound, &amp; mingle with
evill, what he possibly could, both by thrusting false brethren into the true
Ch: &amp; by keeping godly persons out of it. So that the servants of God
stand in great need as first of spirituall discerning to know good, &amp; evill, so
after of true Zeal on the one syde, that they be not for the goods sake, en∣tangled
with any evill: as also of godly moderation, &amp; sobriety, on the

with it: as this man hath done in the frowardnes of his heart, in stead
of Zeal: makeing no difference between himself, &amp; others so walking, in

iustifyed, agaynst his lowd, &amp; licentious clamours, (although by
them he have affrighted two, or three simple people, from that their bap∣tism

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>E proceedeth to <HI>the baptism of Infants;</HI> a poynt of great both dif∣ference
between vs, &amp; weight in it self: &amp; which concerneth all
Churches, at all tymes, whereas the former respects onely such
Churches as come out of a state of Apostacy.</P>
<P>And to prove Infants vncapable of baptism, he begins with the Cove∣nant
of the gospell, or new Testament, which he rightly makes one, as in∣deed
they are in substance, (though <HI>the new Testament</HI> may be taken in a
stricter sence, for the gospell more clearly dispensed since Christ come in
the flesh:) touching which Covenant he speaketh thus.</P>
<P>This is the Covenant, (<HI>sayth the Lord</HI>) that I will make with the house of<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Helw</NOTE>

theyr God, &amp; they shalbe my people <HI>Ier: 31. 33. Hebr:</HI> 8. 10. And our Saviour
Christ declares this more fully, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. where he sayth, Go yee into all the
world, &amp; preach the gospell: he that shall beleiv &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e baptized, shalbe saved. And
here (<HI>sayth he</HI>) is the new Covenant set down both on Gods behalf, &amp; theyrs with
whom it is made. On Gods that he would write his law in mens hearts, by the power
of his spirit in the preaching of the gospell, &amp; wilbe theyr God, &amp; save them: &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the peoples behalf, to beleiv the gospell, &amp; to be baptized. <HI>And herevppon he in∣fers,
&amp; concludes, that</HI> children are not within the Covenant of the new Testament,
or gospell, &amp; therefore not to be baptized.</P>
<P>Let the Reader in the first place observ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANSW:</NOTE> that the word <HI>Covenant</HI> in the
<HI>Hebrue,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> as Ieremy hath it, signifyeth any compact, or agreement vppon a
difference, between two, or more. Which the LXX in the <HI>Greek Bible,</HI> &amp;
so the Apostle after them, turn by a word signifying a <HI>will</HI> or <HI>Testament</HI>
properly. So that he who aright vnderstands, &amp; well weighs the very word,
will playnly see, how <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> erreth in makeing the <HI>wryteing of Gods law
in mens hearte, the Covenant on Gods behalf:</HI> or <HI>baptism</HI> any part of it <HI>on mans be∣half.</HI>
The Covenant is the very agreement &amp; promise by mutuall accorde,
for the things to be done, &amp; not the doeing of the things, which is the
keeping of the Covenant, or promise made. And so all that can be conclu∣ded
hence is, that God receaveth none into his Church but such as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whose hearts he promiseth to write his law: Which he promised to do
to the infants of the faythfull, in promiseing Abraham to be <HI>the God of

is also evidently proved, that the infants of faythfull parents are together
with them, within in the L: Covenant.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="40"/>
But to answer more fully: the intent of the prophet (&amp; so of the Apostle<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ 18. 1. Cor. 3▪ 3.</NOTE>
following him) is to oppose <HI>the ould Covenant,</HI> or <HI>Testament of workes written

hearts</HI> of men by the finger <HI>of Gods spirit.</HI> Now the persons with whom the

were men of years; but in whom their infants were included, &amp; so within
these the L: Covenants, though secondarily, &amp; as was agreable to their
estate.</P>
<P>These men professe every where, &amp; truely (although not vppon good
grounds) that the Israelitish infants were within the ould Covenant, or
Testament: &amp; yet when <HI>God</HI> eyther proclaymed it vppon <HI>mount Sina,</HI> or
<HI>writ</HI> it in <HI>the tables of stone,</HI> they knew not what it meant, neyther could they
have the same vse of it with their parents, &amp; others of discretion, as may
appear in the particulars conteyned in the Scriptures Exod: 19. 10. 11. 15.
21. 25. &amp; Ch. 20 1. 2. 8. 12. 18. 19. amongst others, where it is set down:
doth it therefore follow that those infants were not within the compasse of
the ould Testament, or law? So neyther followeth it, because the infants
of the faythfull now cannot for the present, observ the conditions of the
Covenant of Grace, or reap all the fruits thereof, &amp; particularly, to have
<HI>the law written in theyr hearts</HI> by the ministery of the gospell, &amp; work of the
H. Ghost, that therefore they are excluded from the Covenant of Grace,
or Testament of Christ, Children may with far better reason be denyed, to
have been within the Covenant of the ould Testament, or <HI>law,</HI> vppon which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</NOTE>
the <HI>curse</HI> followeth, then to be shut out of the new Covenant of grace, &amp;
mercy. And vppon this ground Infants should not be within eyther the
naturall Covenant or bond with their parents, or the civill Covenant with
their Magistrates, because they cannot for the present <HI>Honour Father, &amp;
Mother,</HI> which is the condition of these Covenants on their behalf. His
exception then that <HI>infants cannot by the preaching of the gospell, have Gods law
written in theyr heart,</HI> this being but a condition of the Covenant, which re∣spects
men of riper years, is of no force.</P>
<P>When the Lord sayth to <HI>Israell, I am thy God,</HI> his meaning is not to
exclude their infants, though he spake not vnto them, but to exclude
other peoples, &amp; nations: so where he makes this new Covenant with
those in whose hearts he writes his lawes, he doth not debar their children,
but wicked men destitute of the spirit of God, &amp; from vnder his promise.
So for Mark 16. 15. 16. which he also alledgeth, where <HI>Christ sends his
Apostles into the world to preach the gospell,</HI> &amp; ads that <HI>he who beleeveth &amp; is baptized,
shalbe saved,</HI> he no more entends to exclude the infants of the faythfull from
baptism, because they beleev not, then frō salvatiō because they beleev not:
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>
which is yet more playn in the words following, <HI>but he that beleeves not shalbe
damned.</HI> Shall children now be damned because they believ not? There is
hence more colour for that, then that they shall not be baptized because
they beleev not: for Christ sayth not, <HI>he that beleeves not,</HI> shall not be bap∣tized,
but <HI>shalbe damned.</HI> The thing then is: Christ neyther excludes the
children of beleevers from baptism, nor from salvation, for want of fayth,
but vnbeleevers, &amp; such as refuse the gospell from both. So that the stone
vppon which these men stumble, is the ignorance of the opposition in the
Scriptures they bring; which is not between beleevers, or sanctifyed per∣sons,
&amp; their children, but between them, &amp; vnbeleeveing &amp; prophane per∣sons:
who are shut from the Lords <HI>Covneant, Baptism,</HI> &amp; <HI>Salvation.</HI> But where
in shareing this Covenant <HI>on mans behalfe</HI> into fayth, &amp; baptism, he makes
the one parte thereof, his being baptized, he speaks he knowes not what,
&amp; yet wonders that all men beleiv him not. For as Bapt: is indeed no parte
of the Covenant, but a signe, &amp; seal of further confirmation, so is it prin∣cipally,
&amp; in the mayn end performed, not <HI>on mans behalfe towards God,</HI> but
on Gods behalf towards man; (God by the outward washing of the body
with water, signifying, confirming, &amp; applying the inward washing of the
soul, by the blood, &amp; spirit of Christ:) &amp; for the further testification of
the admission of the party baptized into the family of God, the <HI>Father, Son,
&amp; H. Ghost, into</HI> whose <HI>name</HI> he is <HI>baptized:</HI> whereas in a 2<SUP>d</SUP>, &amp; inferiour re∣spect
it is a work of man vnto God, for the profession, &amp; exercise of fayth,
repentance, &amp; thankfulnes in them who receaved the former covenant, &amp;
promise with the confirmation thereof, on Gods parte, towards them, &amp;
theirs: as it is also thirdly a signe of vnion between the members of the
Church: &amp; in the 4<SUP>th</SUP>, &amp; last place, a badg of Christianity, &amp; signe of dis∣tinction
between the true Church, &amp; all false Churches. The same confide∣rations
are to be had of the L: Supper. And they who know not these
things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 6. 1</NOTE> had need have <HI>the foundation of the doctrine of baptism,</HI> &amp; other princi∣ples

infants, though for the present, they neyther know it, nor can do
any thing agayn to the Lord in answer therevnto, is a mayn ground of that
offence, which these men take at our receaving, &amp; baptizeing of Infants.
And if the new Covenant or Testament consist so much in baptism, as these
men think, then could not Adam, &amp; Abraham, &amp; other the holy Patriar∣kes,
&amp; Prophets vnbaptized, have been within the compasse of the Cove∣nant,
&amp; promise of grace, or have had their partes in the Testament of
Christ, the promised seed. Also if baptism were (especially so great) a
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>
parte of the Covenant, so oft as any eyther person, or Ch: renued their
Covenant, especially after any greater sin, they should so oft renue their
baptism also.</P>
<P>These things thus layd down by way of answer, it remaynes I prove by
the Scriptures, &amp; further Arguments, that the infants of the faythfull are
within the compasse of the new Covenant here spoken of.</P>
<P>And since all children comeing naturally of Adam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 51. 5▪</NOTE> are <HI>conceaved, &amp; born
in sin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE> &amp; <HI>by nature the children of wrath;</HI> if these men beleev (as they do of all)
that their children so dying shalbe saved by Christ, then must they have a
parte in his Testament, or in this new Covenant, which are all one. There
are not two new Covenants, or Testaments established in the blood of
Christ but one. And since Christ is propounded vnto vs as <HI>the saviour of his
body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 2▪</NOTE> <HI>which is his Church</HI> it is more then strange, that these men will have all
infants saved by Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 1▪</NOTE> &amp; yet none of them to be of his body, or Church.</P>
<P>It pleased God in his speciall love to send his sonne to take vppon him
our nature, &amp; so our childehood, that as the head thereof, he might sancti∣fy
even that estate for his body the Church: with which he did also in the
dayes of his flesh, visibly communicate his grace, consecrateing vnto his
Father, as their true high preist, the infants of the Iewish Church, by <HI>lay∣ing
his hands on them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">† Mark. 10. 13. 1▪</NOTE> <HI>&amp; blessing them.</HI></P>
<P>I ad, if any, eyther children, or men of years, be to <HI>enter into the kingdom
of heaven,</HI> they must be born agayn: &amp; this new birth must be by the spirit of
God workeing in eyther, accordeing to their kinde, &amp; writeing Gods law
in their hearts: in those of years distinctly, &amp; by the preaching of the gospell,
in infāts otherwise, accordeing to the efficacy of the power, &amp; grace of God.</P>
<P>Lastly it is evident that the children of the faythfull are within this
Covenant of the Gospell or new Testament by that Covenant which <HI>God
made with</HI> faythfull <HI>Abraham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen 17.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; his seed,</HI> adding the <HI>seal of circumcision</HI> to ra∣tify
it. But that this was the Covenant of the Gospell, or new Testament

not heavenly things: the promise of them was conteyned in the other,

(which must well be considered) was not appoynted of God principally for

many years before circumcision was once mentioned. Which Cove∣nant
God also renued with <HI>the Israelites</HI> his seed in the wildernes, the most of
them being vncircumcised. By which it is evident, that <HI>Circumcision</HI> was so
far from being the substance of the Covenant, as that it was not so much
as any substantiall parte of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 29▪ &amp; 30. <HI>compa∣red

on Gods parte, as was Canaan an accessory vnto it. 3<SUP>dly</SUP>, the Apostle
Rom. 4. proveing at larg, <HI>iustificatiō by fayth, without workes,</HI> &amp; so specially with∣out
<HI>circumcision,</HI> of which as of a speciall work the Iewes made account, takes
Abraham for an instance, &amp; shewes, that he was first iustifyed by beleeving
Gods free promise touching his <HI>seed, Christ,</HI> &amp; so the Ch: in him, as well of
<HI>vncircumcised</HI> Gentiles in their tyme, as of circūcised Iewes: &amp; ads that after
this, <HI>he receaved the seal of circumcision,</HI> for the confirmation of this bond of
promise, on Gods parte, haveing the promise it self before. Which Circum∣cision
therefore whosoever presumed to vse (whether vppon himself, or his
infant) not haveing before the promise of Christ, &amp; fayth for iustification,
with Abraham, he did treacherously vsurp the great <HI>seal</HI> of the king of heavē,
&amp; earth. The lawfull vseing then of circumcision did presuppose both Gods
promise &amp; his fayth, who was to vse it, eyther vppon himself, or his childe.

in the earth, into Covenant with himself, to worship him, &amp; to enioy his
speciall presence, &amp; yet should requyre no more of them for the keeping of
this Covenant, then the cutting of their foreskins, is a mere mockery, vn∣worthily
blemishing Gods great maiesty, &amp; from the imagination whereof
all godly wise men do abhor.</P>
<P>Now though this which I have spoken, be more then enough, yet will
I for more clearnes, annex a few other Reasons to prove this <HI>Covenant with
Abraham, &amp; his seed,</HI> the Covenant of the Gospell, &amp; the same with ours
now for substance; &amp; established in Christ to come, as ours in Christ come
in the flesh.</P>
<P>And 1. the Apostle to the Galat: expresly teacheth, that <HI>the Gospell was
preached vnto Abraham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b. 3. 8.</NOTE> IN THEE SHALL ALL THE GENTILES BE
BLESSED, &amp; v: 17. that <HI>the Covenant with,</HI> &amp; <HI>in</HI> ABRAHAMS SEED,
was confirmed of God in respect of Christ, &amp; that 400, &amp; 30 years before
<HI>the law,</HI> or ould Testament <HI>was</HI> given. And here also the Apostle answereth
<HI>M^ Helw:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Helw</NOTE> his obiection, &amp; removeth that great stone of offence, which he,
&amp; others cast in their own way; which is, that <HI>the ould Testament,</HI> or <HI>Cove∣nant
with the ordinances thereof is disanulled</HI> Hebr: 7. 18. &amp; that, <HI>we ought not to
frame the new Covenant like the ould, as we do, in the baptizeing of infants, because
infants then were circumcised.</HI> The Apostle answereth directly (to let passe
other things) that <HI>the Covenant with Abraham</HI> was <HI>confirmed in respect of
Christ:</HI> &amp; that it was not <HI>the law</HI> or ould Testament, which was <HI>added</HI> 400,
&amp; 30 <HI>years after for transgression,</HI> &amp; so is <HI>abolished</HI> indeed, but <HI>could not disanull
the former Covenant of the Gospell.</HI></P>
<P>And because these men (whose recovery I do from myne heart desyre
of the Lord) do especially stumble at this, that <HI>the Covenant</HI> made <HI>with
Abraham, &amp; his seed,</HI> was the Covenant of the law, or ould Testament, I will
(&amp; that breifly as I can) shew the clear, &amp; evident difference betweén these
two Testaments. Which had such of our later<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calvin. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucanus</NOTE> wryters as have been most

been given for the preventing of this errour.</P>
<P>And 1. this difference appears notoriously, in the tyme. For this <HI>ould,</HI>
&amp; canceled <HI>Covenant</HI> was <HI>made with the people of Israell</HI> in the day, when the
Lord took them by the hand, &amp; brought them out of Egipt. Ier: 31. 32.
which was 400, &amp; 30 <HI>years after the Covenant made with Abraham,</HI> as the Scri∣ptures <MILESTONE N="I"/>

<P>The <HI>law,</HI> or ould Testament was given in <HI>mount Sina</HI> Exod: 19. whereas <MILESTONE N="II"/>

Gods iustice: but <HI>the Covenant with Abraham</HI> was free from all terrour, &amp;

<P>The <HI>ould Testament</HI> had <HI>Moses for the mediatour:</HI> whereas <HI>Abraham</HI> him∣self <MILESTONE N="IIII"/>

the Scriptures do not so speak, neyther can any man haveing wisdom, &amp;

&amp; nourish fayth in him, &amp; his.</P>
<P>The confounding then of the Covenant given to Abraham with that
given by Moses is in it self a great errour, &amp; the ground of this amongst
other evilles, that it curseth where God blesseth. For where God promised
vnto Abraham, &amp; his seed a blessing in that Covenant, this other of the law
bringeth all flesh, as vnable to keep it, vnder Gods curse: being given prin∣cipally
<HI>for transgression,</HI> that is, to discover mens trangressions, &amp; sins, that
despayring in themselves they might fly to the gratious promise made to

Abraham, &amp; in it, vnto Christ to come, &amp; so fynde mercy with God tho∣rough
repentance. Which Covenant therefore the Lord vppon their re∣pentance,

the Covenant of the Gospell with Abraham, yea or with Adam eyther.</P>
<P>3<SUP>dly</SUP>, &amp; lastly, the whole body of the Scriptures may be devided into
two partes: the law or ould Testament, &amp; the Gospell or new. Now of the
ould Testament Moses is propounded vnto vs as the minister, &amp; mediatour:
as is Christ for the minister, &amp; mediatour of the new. For <HI>the law was given
by Moses, &amp; grace, &amp; truth by Christ Iesus.</HI> Not as though <HI>Moses</HI> preached
not the gospell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oh. 5. 46. Heb. 4. 2.</NOTE> (<HI>for he wrote of Christ:</HI> &amp; <HI>preached the gospell to the Israelites in the
wildernes:</HI>) nor as if, on the contrary, <HI>Christ</HI> taught not the law, (for we may
see the contrary, as els where, so especially Math: 5. where he both openeth,
&amp; inforceth it agaynst the corrupt glosses of the pharisees) but because the
ministery of <HI>Moses</HI> was cheifly legall, &amp; the ministery of <HI>Christ</HI> cheifly Evan∣gelicall,
or of the Gospell. In which respect also it is, that we (though the
Scriptures never so speak) vse to call the wryteings of Moses, &amp; the Prophets
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
<HI>the ould Testament,</HI> &amp; those of the Evangelists, &amp; Apostles, <HI>the new Testament.</HI>
Now vnto those two generalles, 1. the law most fully, &amp; solemnly published
by Moses: &amp; 2. the gospell by Christ, all the particulars of what kynde soe∣ver
dispersed throughout the whole Bible must be referred immediately: &amp;
so the Covenant made with Abraham being referred to that clear, &amp; full
revelation of Christ come in the flesh, as a parte to the head, is after the law
given to, &amp; by Moses: whom the Scriptures do every where in that re∣spect
oppose vnto Christ, but never Abraham. I proceed.</P>

Abraham. Mary, &amp; Zachary filled with the H. Ghost</HI> do teach that God in
his Covenant with Abraham, &amp; his seed promised Christ: &amp; in giveing
him remembered the same Covenant;<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Helw</NOTE> with what ghost then do others af∣firm
that in that Covenant he promised nothing but the land of Canaan?
or how can godly men put out this clear light of the Scriptures shineing in
their hearts?</P>
<P>The Apostle Rom: 4. 11. calles <HI>Circumcision,</HI> which was <HI>the signe</HI> of that <MILESTONE N="IIII"/>
<HI>Covenant, the seal of the righteousnes of the fayth in,</HI> or of that of <HI>the vncircumcision,</HI>
that is, of the fayth which he being vncircūcised had, that in his seed Christ
should be iustification for beleeving vncircumcised Gentiles, as well as cir∣cumcised
Iewes. Wherevppon it followeth, (if the Covenant, &amp; seal agree
in one) that the Covenant it self was of the righteousnes of fayth, which
the gospell bringeth: opposed to <HI>the righteousnes of the law,</HI> which Moses de∣scribeth,
where he sayth, <HI>The man that doth these things, shall live in them.</HI> Rom:
10. 5. 6. In which place the Apostle playnly teacheth, that the Covenant
renued with Israell Deut: 29. &amp; 30. was the Covenant of the Gospell, &amp;
righteousnes of fayth in Abrahams promised seed.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Sriptures do most playnly, &amp; plentififully teach, that the Co∣venant <MILESTONE N="V"/>
with Abraham, &amp; his seed, the Israelitish Church, was the same
with ours in nature, (though diversly dispensed) &amp; therefore the Cove∣nant
of the Gospell. I will note some specially places.</P>
<P>We are taught by Christ Math: 21. 41. that <HI>the vyneyard,</HI> which <HI>the Iewes</HI>
had, should be <HI>taken from them, &amp; let out to other housbandmen:</HI> &amp; more playnly v:
43. that <HI>the kingdome of God should be taken from them, &amp; given to a nation, which
should bring forth the fruits thereof.</HI> Here is the very same <HI>kingdom of God,</HI> or Ch:

were <HI>wilde olives,</HI> are <HI>by fayth grafted into the same root, from which the Iewes,

the naturall branches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. 18. &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 23.</NOTE> thorough vnbeleif, were broken of:</HI> &amp; into which, <HI>they should,
if they abode not in vnbeleef, be grafted in agayn:</HI> makeing the Church of Iewes,
&amp; Gentiles one tree growing vppon the same root <HI>Abraham, Isak,</HI> &amp; <HI>Iacob.</HI>
The same Apostle also compareing <HI>the Ephesians</HI> before their calling, with
<HI>the Iewes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 11 12. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 17.</NOTE> sayth, they <HI>were in tymes past without Christ, haveing no hope, &amp; without
God in the word:</HI> therein shewing that the Iewes in their right estate, &amp; cal∣ling,
had all these: as they also were <HI>near</HI> before, the Ephesians being of
<HI>far of,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch 3. 4 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>made near by the blood of Christ:</HI> vnto which ad that <HI>the Gentiles were to be

spirituall meat, &amp; drunken of the same spirituall drink, Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And such is the clearnes of those places to prove the Covenant, &amp;
Church with, &amp; of <HI>Abraham, &amp; his seed,</HI> the same in nature with ours, &amp;
so the Covenant, &amp; Church of the Gospell, as that he who goes about to
darken their light, would cover the sun with a ragged clout. And as eve∣ry
by-way, &amp; false profession (notwithstanding any other likely things
in it) hath some or other such notorious errour, as that all haveing spiri∣tuall
eyes (not dazled too much some way, or other) may discover it:
so would the Lord mark out this profession of Anabaptistry, as not from
heaven, by this errour, that the Covenant with Abraham, <HI>I wilbe thy God,
&amp; the God of thy seed,</HI> is the Covenant of the law, &amp; not of the gospell. Vppon
which notwithstanding doth depend the reiecting of Infants from the Ch:
&amp; baptism: as also the repeating of the bapt: receaved in false Churches,
as may appear to him, who well observes their pleading for <HI>apostate Israell,</HI>
as a true Ch: because it was <HI>Abrahams carnall seed,</HI> &amp; so had <HI>circumcision</HI> as <HI>a
seal of a carnall Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>And here I think it a fit place to lay down such Scriptures, &amp; grounds,
as vppon which we admit the Infants of the faythfull into the Church &amp;
to the baptism thereof: &amp; so after to answer what is obiected, interming∣ling
also amongst myne answers other proofes, as occasion is.</P>
<P>Now 1. these men graunt, that accordeing to the Covenant mentio∣ned <MILESTONE N="I"/>
Ier: 31. &amp; Hebr. 8. the Church is to be gathered, &amp; bapt: to be admi∣nistred:
&amp; that the Infants of the faythfull, (for they hould it of all) are
vnder a Covenant, or promise of salvation, by Christ: whence I conclude,
that, since there is but one new Covenant, or Testament established in the
blood of Christ, therefore these Infants (&amp; of others hereafter) have in∣terest
in the Church gathered accordeing to this Covenant, &amp; in the bap∣tism
thereof.</P>
<P>If the Covenant made with Abraham, &amp; his seed, whereof Circumci∣sion <MILESTONE N="II"/>
was a seal, were the Covenant of the Gospell, or new Testament, as
<PB N="81" REF="45"/>
have formely proved, then standeth it good to all the faythfull, &amp; their
seed to the worlds end, notwithstanding the different ordinances accorde∣ing
to the considerations of Christs being to come, &amp; being come in the
flesh. And so these men denying our seed this Covenant, &amp; priveledg of
enterance, do deny the Gospell, &amp; new Testament. And if <HI>the kingdom of
God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 43. Eph. 3. 6.</NOTE> or Churchstate of the Iewes (which did comprehend infants with
their parents) be <HI>given</HI> to vs, &amp; we made <HI>one body</HI> with them, then must the
Ch: now comprehend infants also with their parents: otherwise we are
not the same body, &amp; kingdom with them And if with the vnbeleeving
Iewes their infants were <HI>broken of,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10. 17.</NOTE> (who are otherwise vnbroken of at this
day) then must our infants be planted in with vs, whom God hath given
to beleev: otherwise we are not <HI>planted in theyr place.</HI> And if the Iewes shalbe
<HI>grafted in agayn</HI> (which <HI>agayn</HI> shewes it to be of them who had been grafted
in before) if they continue not in beleif,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 23.</NOTE> then must the infants be grafted
in with their parents at the first, &amp; so our seed with vs.</P>
<P>That God did out of his speciall love separate from the world the in∣fants <MILESTONE N="III"/>
with their beloved parents into his Church, &amp; Covenant vnder the
seal thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 17. 7▪ Lev. 20. 24. 26. Deut: 29. 10. 11. &amp;c.</NOTE> before Christs comeing, the Scriptures expresly teach, &amp; every
one will graunt. Except these men can shew where God hath cast the in∣fants
of those beloved parents out of the Church into the world, &amp; taken
that his love from them, they must remayn in the Ch: to the worlds end.
For what God hath once established. God onely can repeal: &amp; that this
Covenant with Abraham was not the ould canceled Covenant, or Testa∣ment,
I have proved before. They bid vs prove that children are of the
Ch: &amp; to be baptized: but we requyre of them proof how they are cast
out of the Church, &amp; baptism thereof: &amp; how the grace of God is so shor∣tened
by Christs comeing in the flesh, as to cast out of the Ch: the greatest
parte of the Ch: before, the infants of beleevers?</P>
<P>The L: Iesus sent out his Apostles Math: 28. 19. to <HI>teach,</HI> or make disci∣ples <MILESTONE N="IIII"/>
<HI>all nations,</HI> &amp; to <HI>baptize them:</HI> opposeing all nations to that one nation
of the Iewes: as if he should have sayd thus. I have formerly declared my
will to that one nation, &amp; circumcised it: <HI>go</HI> you now, &amp; <HI>teach all nations,</HI>
&amp; baptize them. Now if Christs meaning had been, that they should not
with the parents (being made disciples, &amp; baptized) baptize the children,
as before they had with the parents (being made disciples, &amp; circumcised)
circumcised the children, it had been needfull he had given them a caveat
to leav the children of the faythfull out in the world, though they had for∣merly
been in the Church. If it be obiected, that they who were <HI>taught, &amp;
beleeved, were to be baptized,</HI> therefore not Infants, I deny the consequence:
which should be, if it were true, &amp; therefore not Infidels, &amp; such as refuse
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>
the Gospell. And this is the opposition which the Scriptures make, set∣ting
impenitent, &amp; vnbeleeving persons, agaynst the penitent, &amp; belee∣vers,
&amp; not children agaynst their parents, which is childeish to ima∣gine.</P>
<P>The Apostle Peter Act: 2. 38. 39. exhorts the Iewes to repent, &amp; to be <MILESTONE N="V"/>
baptized, vppon this ground, that <HI>the promise was made to them, &amp; theyr chil∣dren,
&amp; to all afar of as many as the Lord should call.</HI> As if he should say, God
hath promised vnto <HI>Abraham,</HI> that he would <HI>be his God, &amp; the God of his
seed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuke 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>in that blessed seed Christ. He hath</HI> now <HI>remembred his holy Covenant,</HI> or

deprive your selves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1. 13.</NOTE> &amp; your children of the fruit of this gratious
promise: but that it may be profitable to you, &amp; them; repent, &amp; so be
baptized for your confirmation: &amp; let the seal be set to the Covenant in
which you, &amp; your children are.</P>
<P>To elude this place alledged in my former book, <HI>Mr Helw:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Helw</NOTE> comments
vppon it in these words. <HI>The Apostle sayth to &amp; of all the vnbeleeving Iewes, &amp; Gen∣tiles,
the promise is made to you, &amp; to your children, even as many as the L. shall cal:</HI>
&amp; so takeing his own imagination both for text, &amp; exposition, he bids me
<HI>prove that by children there are meant Infants.</HI></P>
<P>1. These words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANSW:</NOTE> <HI>to them that are afar of,</HI> (which he leavs out in his
accustomed bouldnes with the Scriptures) with the words following, are
not meant of the Gentiles at all, but of the Iewes <HI>far of</HI> in tyme, as the
originall greek beareth it. For neyther was <HI>Peter</HI> himself yet so well in∣formed
of the calling of the Gentiles, neyther (had he so been) was
it then a fit tyme to speak of it to the weak Iewes. He speaks then inde∣finitely
<HI>of</HI> the Iewes as the seed of Abraham, &amp; within the Lords Cove∣nant,
or Promise: whom therefore Ch: 3. 25. he calles the Sonnes of
the Covenant: &amp; to the Iewes alone, as is evident, where v. 14. 16. 22. 29.
he quotes the Prophesyes of <HI>Ioell,</HI> &amp; <HI>David:</HI> which to vnbeleeving Gen∣tiles
had been in vayn. Yea that of <HI>the Promise</HI> he directs distinctly to such
Iewes onely, as had the work of grace begun in them: being <HI>pricked in theyr
hearts</HI> for the <HI>crucifying</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> &amp; earnestly set to know, &amp; do the will of
God. v. 37. 39.</P>
<P>That <HI>by children</HI> here are <HI>meant Infants,</HI> I have by the drift of the place, &amp;
conference of other Scriptures proved; &amp; that the H. Ghost speaks of the
Covenant with Abraham, neyther was there otherwise cause of nameing
their <HI>children.</HI></P>
<P>Where he further bids me <HI>prove</HI> that <HI>the inheritance of the kingdom of
heaven goes by succession of generation, as the land of Canaan did,</HI> he begets ba∣stardly
errours of his own, &amp; thē would have me nourish them. For neyther
<PB N="83" REF="46"/>
did the land of Canaan come by succession of generation, but by Gods
promise made vppon condition of fayth, &amp; holines, as I have formerly
proved: much lesse doth the kingdom of heaven: but by Gods gratious
promise, &amp; gift, both to young &amp; ould. These men think the kingdom
of heaven comes to all Infants so dying; &amp; doth it therefore come by car∣nall
generation? If it come otherwise to all, &amp; by the free grace of God in
Christ, as they suppose, can they see no other way, but it must needs come
to the Infants of the faythfull, by carnall generation? as if their estate were
worse then the estate of all the rest?</P>
<P>Ad to this Scripture that which we read Act: 16. 14. 15. that <HI>God</HI>
haveing <HI>opened the heart of Lydia, to attend to, &amp; beleev the worde of Paul:
Shee was baptized, &amp; her family.</HI> Shee beleeved, &amp; the fruits, &amp; effect
thereof was, shee, &amp; her family were baptized. With these things doth
agree Christ our Lords his <HI>takeing the litle children</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 10. 14. 16.</NOTE> (to wit of the Iewish
Church) <HI>in his armes,</HI> his <HI>blessing them,</HI> that is his communicateing his
grace with them, &amp; pronouncing that <HI>of such is the kingdom of heaven:</HI>
as also his <HI>commaunding the bringing of such vnto him.</HI> In blessing them
visibly, he shewes them to be lawfull members of his visible Church or
body; &amp; more playnly in pronounceing the kingdom of heaven (which
is his Church vppon earth) to be of such. In commaunding such to
be brought vnto him, he commaunds them by consequence, to be
baptized; since they cannot be brought vnto him personally, as then,
nor otherwise outwardly, or by men, save by baptism. And if Infants
be to pertake of Christes blood, &amp; spirit, there must be some ordinary
means to apply them, God workeing ordinarily by ordinary means,
&amp; the same none but<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Tit. 3. 5. VI.</NOTE> <HI>baptism, that lavacher of the new birth,</HI> as the Apostle
calleth it.</P>
<P>Lastly Paul testifyeth 1. Cor. 7. 14. that if one of the parents be a
<HI>beleever,</HI> the <HI>children are holy,</HI> viz: with the holines of the Covenant (se∣cret
things being left to God) who <HI>otherwise, are vnholy.</HI> Neyther is it
truely answered, that they are onely holy to their parents vse, as is the
vnbeleeving wife to the vse of her housband. For 1. they must eyther
be holy in their persons, or they cannot be saved. 2. he sayth <HI>the vnbe∣leeveing
wife is sanctifyed in,</HI> or to her <HI>beleeveing housband:</HI> but he sayth not
that children are sanctifyed to their parents, but simply that they are
sanctifyed, or holy. 3. It is not true that children are sanctifyed to the
parents there spokē of: the one of them being<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg">Tit. 2. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>vnbeleeving to</HI> whom <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing
is sanctifyed.</HI> Lastly, the very drift of the place proves, that the Apostle hath
reference to the Covenant of Abraham, <HI>I wilbe thy God, &amp; the God of thy seed.</HI>
The thing he intends, is, to prove it lawfull for a beleeveing housband,
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>
or wife to abyde with an vnbeleeving wife, or housband. This he proves
by the Covenant made with Abraham, &amp; with every faythfull sonne, &amp;
daughter of Abraham, that he wilbe the God of his, or her seed: &amp; so en∣dow
them with the holines of the Covenant: &amp; that therefore they should
not make scruple of liveing with their (though vnbeleeveing, if otherwise
lawfull) wives, &amp; hous bands. And in this interpretation is force of Ar∣gument,
both for the Apostles meaning, &amp; Corinth: satisfaction. And so
the seed of the faythfull being holy with the holynes of the Covenant are
necessarily within the same Covenant which halloweth them.</P>
<P>Now whereas some marvayl, why the H. Ghost speaks not more playn∣ly,
&amp; expresly of the admission of infants into the Ch: &amp; bapt: thereof;
they must remember, 1. That none must presume to teach the L: how to
speak, but that all are with reverence to search out his meaning. 2. That
they may with as much reason marvayl, why there is no expresse mention
made of the casting out of the Iewish infants with their vnbeleeveing pa∣rents.
In the very same places the H. Ghost speakes of the <HI>takeing the king∣dom
of God from them, for not bringing forth fruit;</HI> &amp; of <HI>giveing it to the Gentiles:
who would bring forth fruit:</HI> of <HI>breaking of the naturall branches for vnbeleef;</HI> &amp; of
<HI>planting in the Gentiles by fayth.</HI> Now here is no mention of the infants of ey∣ther.
Both the one, &amp; other are comprehended for those outward prero∣gatives,
&amp; dispensations in their parents, <HI>as the branches in the root:</HI> The in∣fants
of the godly, in their godly parents, accordeing to the tenour of Gods
mercy: the infants of the vngodly in their vngodly parents, in the tenour
of his iustice, of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>And here, for the better clearing of things following thereabout, it is
of Speciall vse to observ the diverse considerations, &amp; respects, in which
the Scriptures speak of the Iewish Ch: &amp; ordinances: which are in num∣ber
three.</P>
<P>First considering the Israelites in their iust constitution, &amp; calling of
God, they were<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Rom 11 26. Lev. 24. 25. 26. Deut. 7. 6 7. 8. Num 23. 25. Rom 9. 4 Is. 63. 16 Exo 4 22 Gal. 4. 1. Heb. 6. 17 Ier 31. 20 Rō 11. 21 Gal 2. 15 Ioh 1. 11.

<P>Secondly, the Scriptures sometymes speak of that Church, &amp; ordinan∣ces
by way of comparison with the Ch: &amp; ordinances after Christs death,
&amp; ascension. And in that respect the Apostle, compareing not person with
person, but Ch: with Church, calles it (though <HI>the heyr,</HI> yet) <HI>a childe, in the
non-age:</HI> &amp; <HI>the ordinances tutours, &amp; governours, vnder</HI> which it was: but the

person is the same both a childe, &amp; a man grown: though not to be trayned
vp after the same manner: even such is the difference between them, &amp; vs.
They as a childe, had a harder hand held over them, &amp; were stinted sun∣dry
wayes, where we are free. They were taught by signes, &amp; hand-wryte∣ings,
&amp; poyntings with the finger, as it were: where our institution is
more manlike, &amp; simple. They had earthly things more distinctly, &amp; fully;

the promise,</HI> &amp; was therefore <HI>cast out of Abrahams house:</HI> &amp; so is propounded
as a <HI>figure</HI> of all them, Iewes, or Gentiles, who in the confidence of workes,
reiect the promise of grace, &amp; persequute them that embrace it: bringing
themselves also therein vnder the bondage of the whole law. And thus all
whether Iewes, or Gentiles, then or now, despiseing the free promise of
grace, &amp; looking to workes for iustification, were &amp; are rank <HI>Ismaelites,</HI> &amp;
of Abrahams seed accordeing to the flesh, as the Apostle expresly taxeth <HI>the
Galatians, desyreing to be vnder the law,</HI> though not discending naturally of
Abraham.</P>
<P>Now (that I may apply these things to the present purpose) what is
all this of Abrahams seed accordeing to the flesh in the Apostles meaning
to the infants of the faythfull, whether of the Iewes formerly, or Gen∣tiles
now? Did, or do they, as <HI>Ismaell, glory in the flesh,</HI> &amp; mock at Gods
promise, or any way reiect Christ? Did, or do they <HI>establish the righteous∣nes
of the law, &amp; of works,</HI> or <HI>persequute him that is born after the spirit,</HI> as all they
who are <HI>born after the flesh,</HI> in the Apostles meaning, did, &amp; alwayes do?
Onely they, who thus <HI>Ismael-like, glory in workes,</HI> &amp; <HI>persequute</HI> the true be∣leevers,
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>
are by the Apostle called <HI>Abrahams seed, according to the flesh,</HI> &amp;
of Ismaell. So for the ordinances, &amp; workes of the law thus abused, &amp; per∣verted
for iustification, they were base, &amp; beggerly, vnprofitable, vnho∣ly,
vnhallowing, yea drosse &amp; dung: yea pernitious, &amp; hurtefull, curse∣ing,
&amp; killing them, who so wrought, or deemed them. And thus conside∣red,
the Apostle to the Galatians, Phillipians, &amp; Hebrues speaketh of them;
(giveing them as <HI>Luther</HI> vsed to say, ignominious names) haveing to do
with those, who eyther did, or were in speciall daunger, thus to pervert
them.</P>
<P>And these grounds thus layd, vnto that his obiection, that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Pag. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>the Co∣venant
made with Abraham was a carnall Covenant, because it had a worldly sanctua∣ry,
&amp; preisthood, &amp; carnall rites purifying the flesh, but not purgeing the spirit,</HI> I
do answer, that those ordinances were no parte of the Covenant made
with Abraham, but accessoryes vnto the law given 430 years after:
though there might be a spirituall vse of them, &amp; was, by fayth, as of any
ordinances now &amp; as of the morall law it self, to them that beleev, &amp; re∣pent:
but in, &amp; accordeing vnto this lawfull vse of them the Apostle
speaketh not, but in respect of their abuse, as eyther severed from Christ,
as their end; or ioyned with him for iustification.</P>
<P>His assertion, so oft repeated, that <HI>God in his Covenant with Abraham,
promised but worldly things, &amp; so requyred onely carnall obedience,</HI> I have formerly
refuted, as a notorious ground of Iudaism &amp; Pharisaism. Neyther was it
the more <HI>a carnall Covenant,</HI> because the signe was set <HI>in the flesh,</HI> then is ours
now, because baptism is administred vppon the flesh, or bodyes of the per∣sons
baptized.</P>
<P>But where he ads, that <HI>the iudgment for the breaking of the Covenant of Cir∣cumcision
was a worldly iudgment,</HI> &amp; that <HI>no iudgement of condemnation vs pronoun∣ced
agaynst any, though presumptuously breaking the ordinances, &amp; law of Moses,
but bodily death,</HI> quoteing for that purpose Gen: 17. 14. Numbr. 15. 30.
Hebr: 10. 28. he proceeds on indeed from Pharisaism which made the pro∣mises,
&amp; Messiah carnall, to playn Sadusaism, which denyed a resurrec∣ction,
especially vnto the Iewes, which (as it is written of them) hath
been the perswasion of divers Anabaptists in former tymes. For if eter∣nall
death were not threatned the Iewes for breaking the law, &amp; com∣maundments
given by Moses, though <HI>presumptuously,</HI> &amp; <HI>blasphemously,</HI> of
which he speakes Numb: 15. 30. nor for the worshipping of false Gods, of
which sin <HI>Paul</HI> speakes Hebr. 10. 28. compared with Deut. 17. 2. 3. 6.
then for no sin whatsoever, &amp; so there is no iudgment to come, nor needs
be no Christ to save from it.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="49"/>
The Scriptures quoted speak indeed of bodily death, but includeing in
it spirituall death, without repentance, as did theyr bodily blessings promi∣sed
include spirituall. The Apostle Paul speaking of the last iudgment,
Rom: 2. 12. sayth that <HI>the Iewes sinning, in, or vnder the law, should be condem∣ned</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12. 16</NOTE>
(to wit eternally) <HI>by the law.</HI> It is true he addeth, that <HI>they who so sinned,
might thorough repentance be saved:</HI> (&amp; so may they that sin agaynst the Gospell
now, except theyr sin be agaynst the H: Ghost, which was then vnpardo∣nable,
as now) &amp; in so saying, he graunts, though he observ it not, that the
sin then was in it self, &amp; without repentance, damnable.</P>
<P>He ads, that <HI>by our ground we must baptize all our houshould, &amp; infants,
both born in the house, &amp; bought with mony.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Helw</NOTE> I answer 1. That it followeth not,

in all the particulars about them. The substance of the L: Covenant
with Abraham, was, that <HI>he would be his God, &amp; the God of his seed:</HI> &amp; this
about his bond servants was an accessory vnto it. And of it there was a
more speciall reason for them, then for vs: because they were to be separa∣ted
even Civilly in a more speciall manner from vncircumcised persons,
then we now from persons vnbaptized, as appeareth Ezra 10. 3. 11. &amp;c.

<HI>feared God with all his houshould:</HI> as was <HI>the layer</HI> also <HI>converted, &amp; baptized,
with all his family.</HI> And lastly in the places brought by <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> for the
gathering of the Ch: vnder Christ, the L: promiseth to <HI>make his Covenant
with the house, or family of Israell, &amp; with the family of Iudah.</HI> In all which with
other Scriptures, we see how the tenour of the L: promise, &amp; blessing runs
vppon godly governours, &amp; their familyes. Not but that it comes oft to
passe otherwise, &amp; that faythfull governours have vnbeleevers in their hous∣houlds:
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>
but that this is the ordinary, &amp; orderly state of things: &amp; where
it falles out otherwise in the family, it is at the least the governours Crosse,
if not their sin. Now in this, as in all other particulars, we must consider of
the dispensation of the L: ordinances, accordeing to the orderly state of
things. But to conceav, that Abraham would circumcise any vnbeleeving,
or vnholy person, so appearing, or seed of such, on both sydes, is to accuse
<HI>the father of the faythfull</HI> of vnfaythfull dealing with the seal of the L: Cove∣nant,
in setting it vppon them, who had no parte in it, nor promise of <HI>God
to be theyr God:</HI> though I doubt not but they vnder godly government in
the family, may be admitted into the Ch: vppon the manifestation of a ve∣ry
small measure of grace, with promise of submission vnto all good means
of growth, publique, &amp; private; as might they yet with a lesser measure
have been admitted into the Israelitish Church, haveing a far lesse measure
of revelation of grace, then we now.</P>

of infants of ould. <HI>Abraham beleeved</HI> before he was <HI>circumcised:</HI>
so the ends, &amp; vses of circumcision were, to be <HI>a seal of the righteousnes of fayth,</HI>
&amp; to confirm, that <HI>God</HI> was <HI>the God of the</HI> person <HI>circumcised:</HI> as also to teach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.</NOTE>

which notwithstanding infants could not possibly propound, or
have. Were they therefore to be kept from it? So reasons this man agaynst
the baptism of infants: which followeth in the room of the other, as I
have formerly proved. It is sufficient, that the infants of beleevers are ca∣pable
of the manifestation of Gods goodnes towards them, in being bap¦tized,
as of ould they were circumcised, accordeing to the Covenant. The
<PB N="90" REF="50"/>
other particular ends were, &amp; are to follow, &amp; to be atteyned in their ty∣mes.
Where let it also be noted, that whereas, in the L: Supper there are
requyred for the act of partakeing▪ sundry workes implying vnderstanding

death:</HI> there is no such thing in the act of the administering of Bapt: <HI>but</HI>
onely the person <HI>baptized in the name of the Father, Son, &amp; H Ghost.</HI> The same
difference may be also observed to have been of ould, between Circumci∣sion,
&amp; the eating of the passover, inhibited them who were not capable of
the meaning of the mistery. Exod: 12. 26. 27.</P>

washing with water, baptism</HI>) that even that washing by Gods appoyntment,
is an outward seal, or signe of confirmation, of the new Testament in the
blood of Christ: for that we mean by a <HI>seal:</HI> &amp; to requyre <HI>a print, or impres∣sion,</HI>
is but to quarrell about the word, or letter: when even circumcision
it self (to speak properly) was no print. Where Christ teacheth. Ioh: 6.
27. that <HI>the Father sealed him,</HI> doth he mean that he set any print vppon his
soul or body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is. 8. 16.</NOTE> or more then this, that he designed him to the office of the
mediatour? Where the L: bids the Prophet <HI>seal vp the law among his disci∣ples,</HI>
would he have a print set in their flesh, or more, then that he should
more fully declare, &amp; comfirm the law vnto them? When Paul tels the

confirmation of Christes Testament established in his blood; as is also the
L: Supper, of the breaking of his body, &amp; shedding of his blood for our
sins. And for this sealing, &amp; confirming of Christes Testament in his blood
those ordinances especially serv, &amp; are by his servants to be vsed.</P>
<P>He tels vs, that <HI>in the new Testament there is no seal, but the seal of the spirit:</HI>
&amp; quotes Eph: 1. 17. &amp; other Scriptures speaking of that inward seal,
&amp; proveing it indeed: but not disproveing the outward seals, but playn∣ly
establishing them. For if Gods teaching of, &amp; testifying vnto vs inward∣ly
by his spirit, that we are his in Christ, be an inward seal, then is his
teaching of, &amp; testifying vnto vs, the same thing outwardly, by the Gos∣pell,
&amp; Sacraments, an outward seal, or seals, &amp; so rightly called. And not
onely<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 5. 8</NOTE> <HI>the spirit,</HI> which is inward, but <HI>water, &amp; blood,</HI> which are outward,
do <HI>bear record</HI> of Christ, or confirm, &amp; seal vp his death vnto vs. In respect
of which <HI>water, &amp; blood issueing out of his syde,</HI> our Sacraments are sayd to
have flowen thence. Lastly, <HI>Abraham,</HI> our Father, when he beleeved, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 19. 34.</NOTE>
also <HI>sealed by the Spirit of Promise:</HI> &amp; yet this hindered not, but that both
he, &amp; his seed had the outward seal of circumcision added; even so our
good God, knowing how frayl, &amp; feeble in fayth we are, hath to his gra∣tious
Covenant, &amp; Promise in word, &amp; wryteing, annexed (besydes the
inward seal of the spirit) the outward seales, which we call Sacraments,
for the confirmation thereof, not in it self, but vnto vs: which we are
therefore accordeingly to vse, with reverence, &amp; thankfulnes.</P>
<P>His assertion, that <HI>Infants are not in the Covenant of the new Testament, &amp;
therefore not vnder the seal,</HI> I have formerly disproved. If they be vnder the Pro∣mise
of salvation, they have a parte, or legacy in the will, or Testament of
Christ, or new Covenant, which are both one: &amp; so in this seal of initia∣tion,
or enterance, baptism.</P>
<P>To his affirmation that <HI>parents cannot set the seal vppon theyr infants now, as
they could the seal of circumcision of ould, vppon theyrs,</HI> I do answer, that they can∣not
indeed set the inward seal, no more could they then: but the outward
they can now, as then they could: vnto which God also setteth the inward
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n due tyme, as he hath promised, if they make not themselves vnworthy

by fayth, might as truely have been accused for <HI>bringing in a meruo∣rious
fayth,</HI> &amp;c: I do not then make fayth a meritorious cause to deserv, but
an instrumentall means, or hand, as it were, to receav Gods gratious pro∣mises
in Christ to the faythfull, &amp; their seed: as Abraham when God pro∣mised
him to be <HI>his God, &amp; the God of his seed,</HI> did by fayth, lay hould of, &amp;
receav this promise, &amp; so interessed himself &amp; his in it, &amp; the seal thereof:
which promise had he not beleeved, he had visibly, or before men, deprived
himself &amp; his of all interest in it. The same I iudg of all other faythfull pa∣rents,
leaving <HI>merit</HI> to freewillers, who hould particular election to arise
from fayth forseen: &amp; (as this man affirmed vnto me, &amp; others) that if
God shewed to him any more favour, or mercy, then to the prophanest
man in the world, it were partiallity in him.</P>
<P>He ads that <HI>Abrahams fayth &amp; earnest prayer could not bring Ismaell his childe

Where meaning, as he must, the Covenant of Circumcision, he overthro∣wes<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANSW:</NOTE>
one errour, as he that enterfeers, strikes down one ill leg, by another.
For 1. since Ismaell, &amp; the children by <HI>Keturah</HI> were circumcised, &amp; yet
had no promise of the land of Canaan, his mayn foundation, which is, that
<HI>God in the Covenant of Circumcision, promised nothing on his parte, but the land of
Canaan</HI> is raised, &amp; so all falles, which he buildes vppon it. 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, since the
Covenant there spoken of was the Covenāt of Circumcision, &amp; that Ismaell
with the rest were circumcised, how sayth he, that he, &amp; they were not in
the Covenant, to wit outwardly? Besydes the L: tels Abraham v: 20. that
he <HI>had heard</HI> his prayer <HI>touching Ismaell:</HI> though he meant to stablish his
Covenant with Isak, as the root; of which both the Church, &amp; promised
seed should come, &amp; vnto whom Ismaell (with the rest) should have sub∣mitted,
&amp; adioyned himself; whom because he despised, &amp; in him, Christ,
he was cut of from the Ch: &amp; Covenant afterwards. Which things till
they were revealed made no difference between Isak, &amp; Ismaell: neyther
can the like difference in Gods secret knowledg, or purpose, till the tyme
of revelation, exclude one of the children of the faythfull now, more then
another.</P>
<P>Of Act: 2. 39. I have spoken formerly, &amp; therefore come to the latter
parte of the ground, which he putteth down thus. <HI>God takes occasion by the
sins of parents to exequute his iustice to condemnation, vppon the children. Where</HI>
(sayth he) <HI>I double my sin, in that as before I made the parents fayth the cause of
blessing to salvation, so here, their infidelity a cause of Gods iudgment to condemnation,
to their children.</HI> Where the truth is, he both doubleth, &amp; trebleth iniury
vppon me, &amp; iust blame vppon himself. For first, I neyther mention, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>
medle with eyther the salvation, or condemnation of infants, though he
falsify my words, as if I did: our question being onely about the outward,
or visible Covenant of the Church, &amp; Priveledges thereof: <HI>secret things being
left to God,</HI> as I there expresly speak, alledging Deutr. 29. 29. for that pur∣pose.
2<SUP>dly</SUP>, as I make not the fayth of parents <HI>a cause meritorious,</HI> as he ima∣gineth,
of that good vnto their children, but onely a means of embraceing
Gods gratious offer, &amp; promise: so neyther do I wryte, as he chalengeth
me, that the Fathers infidelity is a cause of the childrens damnation, but
<HI>an occasion, which God vseth for the exequution of his iustice, vppon the children,</HI> being
by nature the <HI>children of wrath.</HI> That then, which I have writtē, &amp; do avouch,
is, that God ordinarily includeth in the parents, the infants, as branches
in the root, eyther for blessings, or iudgments visibly, or in respect of men,
reserving to himself the secret dispensation of things, accordeing to the
tenour eyther of his mercy, or iustice. That the children of the faythfull
are with their parents in the visible Covenant of Gods love, I have at larg
proved by the Scriptures, &amp; might alledg for that purpose many more: &amp;
those not figurative, &amp; shadowish, but conteyning in them promises of eter∣nall<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 37.</NOTE>

<P>The other parte touching the administration of Gods iustice I proved

being spoken of a son forsakeing his fathers sin, &amp; doeing the contrary;
with whom the Lord doth not deal in the course of his iustice, but of his
mercy. † So for <HI>Iosiah, at 8 years ould,</HI> he forsook the wicked wayes of his

appears in the Scriptures, that the L: in giveing him into the hands of the
King of Egipt, had respect to the sins of Iudah, &amp; so of his father, amongst,
&amp; above the rest. In his last example, he affirmeth vntruely, that <HI>the Lord
did not punish the people of Israels children for theyr great transgression</HI> Numb: 14.
26. 27. &amp;c. It is expresly affirmed v: 33. that their <HI>children should wander in

have taken them away also. And so v: 12. the L: playnly sheweth, that
his iustice moved him to the destroying of them altogether, save that his
singular mercy did reioyce agaynst iudgment. And so this instance is clear
agaynst himself.</P>

<HI>children of wrath: or that some parents confer grace by generation, more then others:
or if not, which he assures himself we will confesse, how I can prove, that God should
exequute his iustice to condemnation vppon some children, for the sins of theyr parents,
&amp; shew mercy vppon others, for the fayth of theyr parents, seing God hath sayd, that
every one shall receav salvation, or condemnation, accordeing to that, which he hath
done in the flesh, &amp; not accordeing to that his parents have done,</HI> I answer sundry
things.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="52"/>
And 1. as before, that I do not say, that infants are saved, or con∣demned
for the fayth, or sins of their parents, as he most vntruely accu∣seth
me. The infants saved are saved by the grace of God in Christ: Which
their faythfull parents also beleev, accordeing to Gods Promise, <HI>I will be
thy God, &amp; the God of thy seed.</HI> Those that perish, (though I desyre, if such
were the will of God, &amp; so could gladly beleev, if the Scriptures taught
it, that all were saved) do perish for that originall guilt, &amp; corruption,
wherein they are conceaved, &amp; born, being <HI>the children of wrath by nature,</HI>
&amp; therein lyable to Gods curse, every way. But for that parents are in a
sorte in their children, &amp; so punished in their punishments, their sins also
may, &amp; do concur, as concauses, or causes with other, of Gods iudg∣ments:
both the Scriptures, &amp; reason teaching, that many causes may
meet together in one effect. Yet must it be here, &amp; alwayes remembred,
that our question is not about the peremptory salvation, or condemna∣tion
of any, but about their admission, or not admission into the visible
Church. And straung it is for this man to make it all one, to be saved,
&amp; to be of the visible Church; &amp; to be condemned, &amp; to be out of it,
specially for children; since he will have them all saved, &amp; yet none of
them at all to be of the Church. 2. if he were <HI>assured,</HI> as he sayth, that
we would <HI>confesse, that no parents do confer grace by generation more then others,</HI>
I am assured he shewed the lesse grace, in accuseing vs in another place
agaynst his conscience, to <HI>hould that Christians beget Christians by genera∣tion.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 172</NOTE>
3. Since <HI>all are by nature alike children of wrath,</HI> I would know of
these <HI>free-willers,</HI> how some become the children of God, &amp; beleevers,
&amp; some abyde vnder the wrath of God? To make the thinges, or per∣sons,
which are altogether alike in themselves, vnalike, there must come
something from els where, &amp; that not alike, vnto them both. For ey∣ther
let them alone which are alike, or ad alike vnto them both, &amp; they
will remayn alike still It must not then be any vniversall grace alike com∣mon
to all, which makes them who are alike, to become vnalike one to
another.</P>
<P><HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> els where, &amp; rightly, <HI>disclaymes all freewill, or power in a mans self
to work out his salvation,</HI> but teacheth, that <HI>this grace, which is his mercy in
Christ, God hath given to all, though all receav it not:</HI> for which he quotes
Phil: 1. 10. 11 Act: 13. 46. Act: 7. 51. Where first he layes a notoriouse
errour, for his foundation, in makeing all, &amp; every person in the world par∣takers
of the grace of God in Christ. For they to whom God gives grace in
Christ, must themselves be in Christ: &amp; so all the vnbeleevers, &amp; wicked in
the world should be <HI>in Christ,</HI> which is expresly contrary to the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gal 5. 24 Eph 2. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ioh 3. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> Scriptures
<PB N="96" REF="53"/>
So that wicked, &amp; vnregenerate men have neyther power in themselves,
nor in Christ, (in whom they are not) to work out their salvation. They
indeed, who are in Christ by fayth, &amp; have receaved his spirit, are thereby
enabled to work out their salvation: which Phil: 1. 10. 11. proveth: as
the rest also are able &amp; have power to despise, &amp; reiect the grace of God of∣fered
to condemnation, &amp; this the other two Scriptures Act: 13. 46. &amp; 7.
51. do prove. Which yet a great parte of the wicked in the world do not:
as not haveing so much, as heard of Christ, at least in any competent mea∣sure
for salvation by him: but shalbe iudged accordeing to the law of na∣ture
written in the creatures, &amp; in their naturall consciences. Agayn he<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 1. 8.</NOTE>
speaks contradictoryes in saying, that <HI>all have this grace, or power in Christ,</HI> &amp;
that <HI>God giveth it to all,</HI> &amp; yet confessing, that <HI>all receav it not.</HI> For though
there may be a purpose, will, &amp; offer to give, yet there can be no giveing,
so as the person have the thing, especially that thing, which none can have
agaynst his will, (as none can have grace) except there be also a receaving.
Since then all men are not in Christ, &amp; so not partakers of the grace of God
in him: nor yet, if they were, could a common, vniversall, &amp; equall grace
make them vnequall, who were formerly equall, it followeth that there is a
speciall, &amp; peculiar grace, which God in Christ giveth vnto some, &amp; not to
others: by which they are enabled to vnderstand, &amp; beleev the Gospell, &amp;
to repent: &amp; so by consequence, a speciall, &amp; particular election of those
persons before the world: since <HI>Gods workes are known vnto him of ould:</HI> ney∣ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 15. 8</NOTE>
doth he any thing in tyme, which he did not purpose to do before
tyme.</P>
<P>Lastly since <HI>all</HI> children are <HI>by nature children of,</HI> or subiect to <HI>wrath,</HI> &amp;
which God might in iustice destroy, why should it seem harsh vnto these
men, that he should exequute his iustice vppon some, &amp; shew mercy vppon
others, &amp; save them? If he might in iustice have condemned all, (which
they must needs graunt, if they beleev that <HI>all</HI> are <HI>by nature children of wrath,</HI>
&amp; that God gave his sonne in his mercy, &amp; that it had been no iniustice, if
he had given him for none, no more then he did for the angels that sinned)
will they sue God at the law because he hath not given him effectually for
all, or saved all by him? Will they have him give them account why he ta∣kes
some into the arm of his mercy, when he might have left all to the hand
of his iustice? If he condemn any, they have their due: those whom he
saveth, he doth it of free mercy, vnto which he is not bound. And is any
mans ey evill, because his is good? or because men know no reason, why
God should rayther chuse, &amp; save some, then others, all deserving condem∣nation,
will they yeald him to be no more wise, &amp; no more holy then they?
<HI>The depth of the riches both of the wisdom, &amp; knowledg of God, &amp; the vnsearchable∣nes</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="53"/>
of his <HI>iudgments</HI> appears in this, if in any other thing: as doth also mans
intollerable presumption, who will yeald him no more, then he sees reason
for.</P>
<P>Now though I have done it fully before, yet will I further clear by the
Scriptures, that, though all children are by nature alike, yet in respect of
the grace of adoption, they are not alike, especially vnto vs, &amp; in that iudg∣ment,
which we are to passe vppon them, leaving vnto the L: his secrets.</P>
<P>And 1. who will say, that <HI>Isaak,</HI> being separated from the infants of the
heathen into the Covenant of Gods love, &amp; so signed, as one of the L: pe∣culiar
people; &amp; those infants of the world, from whom he was separated,
(for example, the infants of the Sodomites, about his tyme, who were in
Gods feirce wrath destoyed with fyre, &amp; brimstone from heaven) were alike
in Gods acceptance? We have Isaak set forth as a an <HI>example</HI> of Gods
mercy, &amp; love; &amp; them, with their parents, of his iustice, &amp; <HI>vengance.</HI> Iude

by, &amp; with the Lord, Neh: 10. 28. 29. &amp; the children of the hea∣thenish
woemen, which were shut out with their mothers, &amp; separated, be∣fore
the other could enter it, were to be accounted alike acceptable? The<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 9. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>
Prophet <HI>Malachy</HI> testifyeth for <HI>the Lord,</HI> that he <HI>loved Iakob, &amp; hated Esau,</HI>
(to wit in the decree of his love, &amp; hatred, by iust means to be applyed)
<HI>before they were born:</HI> &amp; this the Apostle Rom: 9. applyeth to the question of
election, &amp; reprobation, touching the two partyes, primarily, &amp; distinct∣ly;
&amp; their posterity, secondarily, &amp; indefinitely, both for persons, &amp;
things And lest any should say, that God thus decreed, in respect of any
thing, which he forsaw they would do, or prove, the Apostle prevents this
shift, &amp; shewes that this was not in respect of <HI>works, but that the purpose of
God might stand, accordeing to election,</HI> v: 11. Besydes had this been primarily
in respect of fayth, or workes forseen, &amp; for that the one would receav the
grace of God, &amp; not the other, the Apostle needed not to have broken out
as he did, speaking of the reason of this his love, or hatred, <HI>But what art thou
o man, who pleadest with God,</HI> &amp;c. The answer had been easy for a childe to<NOTE PLACE="marg">v 20.</NOTE>
have given, namely that the reason why God purposed to love Iakob was
because he forsaw he would receav of himself the grace to be offered, &amp;
beleev: &amp; so to hate Esau for his sin in not receaving the same grace to be
offered as effectually on Gods parte, as vnto his brother.</P>
<P>It is also noted of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> that he <HI>was filled with the H. Ghost even</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 1. 15. Mat 19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 13. 14. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chap. 15 22. &amp;c.</NOTE>
<HI>from his mothers wombe:</HI> which to affirm of all children were a vanity not
worthy the refuteing. Lastly, Christ our Saviour <HI>blessed the infants</HI> of the Israe∣lites,
being of the Church, when they were <HI>brought vnto him:</HI> but with <HI>the
litle daughter of the Canaanitish woman</HI> he refused to communicate his grace.
<PB N="98" REF="54"/>
accounting her as a dog, or <HI>whelp,</HI> till her mother by her faythfull, &amp; zea∣lous
confession, had obteyned for her, interest in <HI>the childrens bread.</HI> And thus
it appeareth (besydes the things formerly layd down) that though all
children be alike in nature, yet are they not all alike in respect of Gods
adoption, especially outwardly manifested, of which we speak.</P>
<P>He ads, that <HI>every one shall receav salvation, or condemnation accordeing to that,
which he hath done in the flesh,</HI> &amp;c. And for answer, I would know of him, how
any infants (so dying) who have done neyther good, nor evill, shall eyther
be saved, or damned? He must answer, that the Scriptures he brings con∣cern
not infants at all, but men of years; &amp; therefore are by him misap∣plyed
to them, whom they nothing concern.</P>
<P>And here note, that as the Ch: in heaven, or of glory, &amp; this in earth,
or of grace, is one in substance; this, the begining of that, &amp; that the con∣summation
of this, so they, who come into the Ch: here, must enter by the
profession, which themselves make: &amp; they that come into the Church
there, by the profession, which Christ shall make of, &amp; for them, accordeing
to their workes. Math: 24. But as it were absurd to say, that infants can∣not
enter into the Ch: &amp; state of glory, because Christ cannot professe of
them, that they have <HI>fed the hungry,</HI> &amp;c: so is it as absurd to exclude them
from the Ch: or state of grace, because they cannot themselves make pro∣fession
of fayth, &amp; repentance. This man by one, &amp; the same errour, which
is the perverting, &amp; misapplying of the Scriptures to infants, which are pe∣culiar
to men of years, debars them of both.</P>
<P>These things considered, I hope it will appear to the godly, &amp; wise rea∣der,
that the things for which he chalengeth me in this (as in other poynts)
are onely <HI>false,</HI> wherein they are by him falsifyed. Yea &amp; if there were no∣ting
els, two of the three last Scriptnres, which he brings agaynst me, do
vndenyably prove as much as (yea more then) I speak: which is, that
<HI>wicked parents do enwrap theyr children in the same evilles visibly,</HI> (for so I speak)
with themselves, adding in the same place, that <HI>this is not so, as though the chil∣dren
were without fault, but as being by Adams transgression, &amp; theyr naturall, &amp;
originall corruption children of wrath, &amp; lyable to all Gods curses, which he also takes
occasion by the sins of the parents to exequute vppon the children, in whose punishments
he also punisheth the parents themselves after a sorte.</HI> The former Scripture is Rom:
5. 14. which proves by his own exposition, that all infants are by the sin
of their common father <HI>Adam,</HI> vnder the reign or tyranny of <HI>death:</HI> the
guilt, &amp; contagion of which sin is by their next parents immediately con∣veyed
vnto them, by naturall generation. And that God hath vsually pu∣nished
the sins even of the next parents both in the death of their children
&amp; otherwise, is so evident in the Scriptures, as that no modest man will
<PB N="99" REF="54"/>
gaynsay it. Yea even for them of years, that other Scripture which he
brings Exod: 20. 5. teacheth playnly, that <HI>the Lord visits</HI> not onely their
own <HI>sins, who hate him, vppon them,</HI> but the <HI>sins of theyr fathers</HI> also. That in
Ezech: 18. 14. 17. as before I have answered, is not of an infant, but of
<HI>a childe</HI> of years, <HI>forsakeing his fathers sins,</HI> &amp; doeing the contrary: with whom
therefore the L: deales not in the course of his iustice, but of his mercy: &amp;
so is not pertinent to the question in hand: which is about infants, &amp; those

<P>And thus have I answered all the particulars in his book, which eyther
respect myne own wryteings, or our speciall cause, &amp; practise. My purpose
also was to have shewed, how whilst he pretends <HI>the discovery of the mistery of
iniquity,</HI> himself is deep plunged in many poynts of Popish iniquity. But for
that I have drawn out the thread of myne Answer further then I intended;
&amp; that most of the particulars will come, for substance, vnder consideratiō,
in the <HI>Survey of M<SUP>r</SUP> Smithes confession,</HI> I will here conclude for the matter of
his wryteing: adding especially for the manner thereof, onely thus much;
that in him, &amp; some others I have had great cause to observ, &amp; bewayl in a
speciall regarde, mans misery, in lying open to this amongst other of Sa∣thans
daungerous practises: which is, when men have escaped his snares
of grosse ignorance, &amp; prophanes, &amp; are come to some measure of know∣ledg,
&amp; conscience of godlines, &amp; have suffered something for the truth,
then to bring them into love with themselves, &amp; their own knowledg Zeal,
&amp; other graces: &amp; withall into the contempt of the knowledg, iudgment,
Zeal, &amp; graces of all other men: that, so soaring aloft vppon the wings of
vayn presumption, &amp; behoulding all others afar of, &amp; as scarse creeping
vppon the earth, whilst they mount on high, they might fall, by riseing, &amp;
that their fall might be great. But let all Gods people be exhorted, &amp; ad∣monished

<HEAD>A Suruey of the Confession of faith published in certain Conclusions by the
remaynders if M<SUP>r</SUP> Smithes Company after his death.</HEAD>
<P>IN honour of the trueth, &amp; love of them who vnfeynedly seeke it, and
more specially of the persons, vnder whose names this Confession pas∣seth
out, I have thought my self even called to examine, &amp; censure by
the word of God, such errours, as by the light thereof, I do discerne in it,
as also in the other writing annexed vnto it: purposing herein to passe by
(as approving it) what I fynde agreable to the Scriptures, albeit not set
down in so convenient termes: to explane, &amp; clear what may seem doubt∣full,
&amp; so to evince by the same Scriptures, what I deem contrarie to the
wholesome doctrine of godlines &amp; forme thereof. In all with I desire my
endevours may so far be blessed of God, &amp; accepted of men, as they con∣tayn
in them his simple trueth, &amp; proceed frō him, who entyrely loveth all
that seeke the same trueth in holines.</P>
<P>And first the 7<SUP>th</SUP> Conclusion with is. <HI>That to vnderstand &amp; conceive of God
in the mynde is not the saving knowledge of God, but to be like to God in his effectes &amp;
propertyes, to be made conformable to his divine &amp; heavenly attributes: this is the
true saveing knowledge of God.</HI> 2. Cor: 3. 18. Math: 5. 48. 2. Pet: 1. 4. <HI>where∣vnto
we ought to geve all diligence,</HI> standes need of explanation. For takeing
the former parte of the sentence eyther exclusively, that salvation standes
not in these thinges alone, or comparatively, that it standes not therein
principally, according to that forme of speach Rom: 1. 19. 1. Co: 1. 17.
it is true, &amp; the Scriptures brought do prove it: but not so, if the wordes
be taken negatively, as though it stood not in these thinges at all. For †
<HI>without faith</HI> (with is wrought in the mynde, &amp; vnderstanding) <HI>no man can</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.</NOTE>
<HI>please God:</HI> nor <HI>come vnto him. ‡ And this</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>is eternall lyfe to know</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 17.</NOTE>
<HI>God the father,</HI> &amp;c. and every where the Scriptures teach, that <HI>by faith Christ
is received,</HI> &amp; salvation obteyned: as is also that <HI>renewing of Gods Image in vs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 1. 12 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oll. 3. 10</NOTE>
first in <HI>the vnderstanding,</HI> in which we are first ioyned to God by true know∣ledge;
and 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, in our harte by sincere love: &amp; so after in the other affec∣tions,
&amp; partes of soule &amp; body.</P>
<P>The 9<SUP>th</SUP> Position where it is said <HI>that God before the foundation of the world
did foresee, &amp; determyne the issue &amp; event of all his workes.</HI> Act. 15. 18 cometh<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion.</NOTE>
much shorte of the trueth though there be no vntruth in it. For God hath
not onely foreseen, &amp; determined the issues, &amp; events of his workes, but
hath also decreed &amp; purposed the workes themselves before the founda∣tion
of the world. And so much the place in the acts proveth: where <HI>Iames</HI>
teaching that <HI>all the workes of God are knowen vnto him from eternity,</HI> purposeth
<PB N="101" REF="55"/>
to prove that the calling of the Gentiles, of with worke he speakes, is not
a thing newly come into the thoughtes of God, but that with he hath pro∣mised,
&amp; purposed before. Which the other place also after alleadged plain∣ly
proves: where it is said, that God <HI>worketh all things according to the counsell</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>
<HI>of his will.</HI> And to conceive that God doth any thing in tyme, with he did
not from eternitie purpose to do, as he doth it, is derogatory to his infi∣nite
wisdom &amp; power: &amp; indeed to deny him to be God, &amp; to make him
finite: in whom there is a chaung wrought, &amp; a begining, &amp; grouth of
counsayls. And this I note for two purposes. First that we may know that
the condemnation of wicked men by God, for sin by their freewill to be
wrought, was purposed of God before the world: it beinge a good worke
of God, &amp; effected by his infinite power for the holynes, &amp; glory of his iu∣stice:
2<SUP>dly</SUP>, that since <HI>every good geveing, &amp; every perfect gift is from above aescen∣ding</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iam. 1. 1</NOTE>
<HI>from the father of lightes,</HI> &amp; that, to know God, to beleve in him, to love, &amp;
obay him, to <HI>receive</HI> Christ, &amp; the Gospel of salvation offered, are the good
giftes of God, we may also know, that God not onely foresees, that those
graces will be in men, but also fore purposes frō eternity himselfe to worke,
&amp; effect them: that if any should tell vs (as many do) that God hath in∣deed
predestinated such men vnto salvation, as he foresaw would beleve in
Christ, &amp; receive the grace in him offered, we may answer them, that God
foresees indeed those graces in those men, but it is because he fore purpo∣seth
to work them. He workes them in tyme, because of his free grace he
purposed to worke them before tyme was: without which his purpose, he
could not have foreseen them. And as the Lord in the begining <HI>saw</HI> that the
things <HI>he had made were all good</HI> when he had made them such: so did he
foresee all other good graces in men, because he forepurposed so to worke
&amp; effect them.</P>
<P>The begining &amp; end of the 10<SUP>th</SUP> Position: viz: <HI>That God is not the Au∣thour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>clusion</NOTE>
<HI>or worker of sin: &amp; that he geves no influence, instinct, motion, or inclinatten
to the least sin,</HI> I embrace: But the middle parte thereof, viz: <HI>That God one∣ly
did foresee, &amp; determyne what evill the free will of men, &amp; Angels would do,</HI> I
except against, as derogatory to the infinitenes of Gods power, &amp; wisdom:
neyther indeed is it senseible to say, that God determyned, what the will of
others would do.</P>
<P>But what the forethoughtes &amp; purposes of God have been from eter∣nity
about sin (so far as the knowledge thereof concerneth vs) will best
appear, if we consider, what the worke of his providence is, in, &amp; about it
in tyme, &amp; when it is wrought by men, or Angels.</P>
<P>And first since sin is the worke of men &amp; Angels, it followeth that sin is
from them, who are themselves from God: though the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be not, but of
<PB N="102" REF="56"/>
themselves: yea not onely the natures, &amp; persons, but even the naturall
powers, faculties, and instruments together with their naturall motions, &amp;
actions, in, &amp; by which sin is wrought, are of God also: by him susteyned,
&amp; vpheld, &amp; acted by his almighty power, which is the cause of every crea∣ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act 17. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE>
&amp; vpholdeth all things, &amp; so of every action, as an action: Sin not be∣ing
created of God, not any part or power of man, or Angel, nor any mo∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE>
or action, but onely the depravation, corruption, crooked &amp; inordi∣nate
abuse &amp; application of the same created part, power, or motion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colle. 1. 7.</NOTE> For
example: the very power, &amp; vse of seeing the forbidden fruit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ob. 1. 3.</NOTE> the naturall
desire of it, as a pleasant thing, the power &amp; ability of taking, as also of
eating it, were of God in themselves: But the sin stood in the inordinate∣nes,
&amp; abuse of the sence, appetite, &amp; power vppon that, which was forbid∣den
by God. And this will yet appeare more playnly, if we consider that
the very same sence, appetite, &amp; worke both of body, &amp; mynd set vppon an
other fruit not forbidden by God, had been no sin at all.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"/> 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, God doth administer the occasions by which the creature through

which by them the Lord wrought in him, were occasions of sin vnto him,
by his own rebellion, &amp; Gods iudgment: &amp; did harden his hart, and
God by them, not as by causes, but occasions, which are also vsed of
God, as all other the like occasions, to all men, for the tryall, discovery, &amp;
conviction of his creature, &amp; to make way for his own further worke of
mercy, or iustice.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"/> Thirdly God doth permit, &amp; suffer sin, &amp; that both willingly, &amp; wise∣ly,
not by geving the creature leave to sin, for that is impossible: but by
not putting the effectuall impediments which might hinder sin, as he both
could and lawfully might, if he would. He could, &amp; might (had he so
pleased) not have created men &amp; Angels, with have sinned: or by irre∣sistable
grace, restreynt, or other disappoyntment have prevented their sin.
He therefore permitteth it willingly, &amp; when he could, hinder it, if he
would, otherwise it were no permission, though he did not hinder it: no
more then a man can be said to permit, or suffer the sun to shyne, or
rayne to fall, that hinders them not. And thus sin (though it be alwayes
agaynst the degrees of the commaunding, approueing, &amp; effecting will
of God) yet is not at all, agaynst his permitting will, or agaynst that degree
<PB N="103" REF="56"/>
of manifestation of that one in it self, &amp; simple will of God: neyther is it
wrought, he absolutely nilling it. <HI>For be being in heaven doth whatsoe∣ver
he pleaseth. His counsayle shall stand, &amp; he will do whatsoever he will,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 115 3.</NOTE>
sayth the Prophet. This sin he doth also suffer, not (as men oft suffer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa 46<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 10,</NOTE>
thinges to come to passe) without care, or consideration of it, but of
purpose &amp; with infinite wisdom, as knowing how to bring light out of
darkenes, &amp; by the creatures sin, to effect his most holy worke, according
to his vnsearchable counsayle: the depth whereof may swallow vp the
mind, but can not be sounded by it, &amp; in the meditation whereof, the best
bound, &amp; bottom is for man to consider, &amp; confesse, that God is both
more wise, &amp; more holy then he.</P>
<P>And so in the 4<SUP>th</SUP> place, God doth most wisely, &amp; most powerfully <MILESTONE N="IV"/>
determine, order, &amp; direct the sins of men, &amp; Angels, in respect of the
continuance, extent, &amp; vse thereof by him to be made: bringing light
out of darkenes, by his almighty power, &amp; wisdom: &amp; effecting by the
creatures vnrighteousnes his own most holy, &amp; righteous purposes. And
thus he sometymes punisheth one sin with another, in the same persons

of feeling, &amp; numnes of heart afterwardes: &amp; sometymes the sin of one
man by the sin of another: and thus he punished <HI>Davids</HI> adulterie, &amp;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 11 &amp; 12 15. &amp; 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; 18.</NOTE>

other iniquities, by the pride, &amp; cruelty of the <HI>Assirians,</HI> &amp; <HI>Babilonians.</HI>
Sometymes also he vseth (or rather abuseth) the sins of wicked Angels<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. King. 17. &amp; 24 &amp; 25.</NOTE>
&amp; men for the tryall of the faith, &amp; patience of his servants, as we see in
the storie of Iob: and sometymes to make way for his own most excellent
workes: as the Redemption of mankynd by the death of his sonne, for
which he vsed the envy of the <HI>Pharises,</HI> the malice of <HI>Sathan,</HI> the treason
of <HI>Iudas,</HI> &amp; the iujustice of <HI>Pontius Pilate.</HI> And in this ordination of evill,
God geveth vs to see, that nothing is absolutely, &amp; infinitely evill, as
he is absolutely, &amp; infinitely good: who also in these ordinations triumph∣eth
over sin &amp; iniquity: which he surely would never suffer, save as he
is able to serve his most holy purpose of it, &amp; of them that worke it:
and in this respect especially God is said to do these thinges, which indeed
are done by wicked Angels, &amp; men, and by him ordered, &amp; determyned to
his most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oly purposes.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="57"/>
And lastly God doth eyther mercyfully pardon, &amp; so abolish in Christ,
or punish in the course of iustice, sin, &amp; sinners, as the Scriptures every where
teach.</P>
<P>And by these the workes of God in &amp; about sin, it appeareth what the
purposes of God were touching it from eternity: for whatsoever God doth
in tyme, whether about sin, or otherwise, that he purposed to do before
tyme, ere the world was: &amp; so for the contrary.</P>
<P>The 16<SUP>th</SUP> Conclusion: <HI>That Adam dyed the same day that he sinned:</HI> Gen:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion.</NOTE>

but withall eternall death, whereof the other is but the begining: as one of

threatned was included bodily death also, with all the meanes, &amp; miseries,
which lead vnto it. And this appeares in the last Scripture alleadged. Which
is Gen: 3. where, God, after many bodily calamities both vppon the wo∣man<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n 3. 16 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 18. 19</NOTE>
man &amp; man for that sin, denounceth as their end, and consummation, death,
&amp; dissolution of body into the <HI>Earth from which they were taken.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that the body being made of corruptible creatures, was sub∣iect
in it self to corruption, &amp; mortality: yet must it be remembred, that
even the heavens themselves were made of one &amp; the same first common
matter, that rude lumpe &amp; vnformed <HI>Chaos,</HI> and so are also in themselves<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 1. 1.</NOTE>
subiect to dissolutiō. Yea whatsoever hath a begining, &amp; is a creature, is sub∣iect
to come to an end naturally: as with which is cōmunicated but a finite
power &amp; vertue; and so the very soules of men, and the Angels are in them∣selves
subiect to death, &amp; mortality, save as they are by the continuall in∣fluence
of the Divine power &amp; providence, susteyned, &amp; preserved. But God
now haveing enobled the whole man soul &amp; body with his <HI>Image</HI> &amp; ioy∣ned
them together in one person: the soul to informe, &amp; quicken the bo∣dy,
&amp; the body to be quickned, &amp; vsed by it, as an active, &amp; lively instrument
for her operations, &amp; workes: the separation of these two (with death is)
being a dissolution of so great a worke of God, &amp; of the habitation of his
own Image, could not come, but by sin. Not that I thinke <HI>Adam</HI> should

soul, &amp; bodie: most of all without the bodies corrupting, &amp; rotting in the
grave: which are the proper fruits of sin. And therefore as God gave him
<HI>a living sonle,</HI> so he gave him <HI>the tree of life in the garden,</HI> as an effectuall Sacra∣ment
of life: he made all things good in themselves, &amp; for him: subject
vnto him, &amp; serviceable to his vse. So that though his bodie were in it self
capable of violence by fyre, water, &amp; otherwise, yet should the providence
of God, the ministery of Angels, &amp; his own perfect wisdom so have directed,
&amp; ordered both them, &amp; himself, as that no hurt, but good every way
should have come vnto him, by them.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore</HI> (sayth the Prophet) <HI>doth the liveing man complayn?</HI> he answer∣eth,
<HI>man</HI> complayneth <HI>for his sins?</HI> So that all the sorrowes of this life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lam. 3. 39.</NOTE> all the
grevous pangs &amp; passions of the minde: all the turmoylings of the body,
by hunger, thirst, wearysomnes, sicknes, diseases, &amp; so death vnto which
they lead, &amp; which is the extremitie of them all, are for sin, inflicted by God,
&amp; by man borne: which the Scriptures every where testify, &amp; that in ex∣amples
so well knowen, as in vayn it were to trouble the Reader with note∣ing
them down.</P>
<P>To conclude: the Apostle Rom: 5. 12. 14. speaking of bodily death,
affirmeth expresly that for <HI>sin it reigned even before the law was given by Moses,
&amp; that over them who had not sinned as Adam,</HI> that is actually: &amp; more playn∣ly,
1. Cor: 15. where speaking of the bodily resurrection, after bodily death,
he teacheth, that <HI>by man &amp; in Adam, all dy:</HI> and that even this bodily <HI>death</HI>
is one of <HI>Christs enemyes to be destroyed</HI> at the <HI>last:</HI> which these men themsel∣ves<NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 22. v. 25.</NOTE>
do also confesse, (though they observe it not) Conclus: 34. and that
<HI>death &amp; the grave are vanquished by Christ</HI> vppon the crosse. And since Christ
suffered nothing but for our sins, if bodily death had not been a punish∣ment
of sin, why should Christ have suffered it, as he did, &amp; that <HI>for our sin∣nes,
according to the Scriptures?</HI> But it will here be demaunded, if God threat∣ned<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor 3.</NOTE>
bodily death vppon <HI>Adam,</HI> the day, he sinned, why he did not accor∣dingly
exequute it? I answer that the threatning was legall, &amp; according
to the course of iustice, and therefore did not hinder but God in mercy
might fynde a remedy, as he also did: &amp; so the L: meaning was no more, but
that in the day wherein <HI>Adam</HI> ate, he should be subject to, &amp; guilty of
death, &amp; the curse of God. In the verie same forme of speach, <HI>Salomon</HI>
threatneth <HI>Shimei, that the day he went out of Ierusalem any whether, he should su∣rely</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kng 37.</NOTE>
<PB N="106" REF="58"/>
dy: that is beguilty of death: for neyther did (neyther almost possi∣bly
could) he actually kill him that very day. The truth then is, that God
threatned not onely spirituall, and eternall death (which is the consumma∣tion
of the former) but bodily also, &amp; with it, all bodily, &amp; temporary ca∣lamityes
leading vnto it. And of this it is most needfull the servantes of
God should be firmely persuaded, &amp; continually myndefull, that in their
sorrowes both of life, &amp; death, they might be lead to the remembrance of
their sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kin. 17 28.</NOTE> &amp; for them be humbled vnder the hand of God, of which fruit
of their afflictions these mens doctrine bereaveth them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 29. 30. 17 <HI>Con∣clusion.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The 17<SUP>th</SUP> Conclusion: <HI>that Adam being faln did not loose any naturall power,
or facultie, which God created in his soul, because the work of the Devill, which is sinn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
cannot abolish Gods workes, &amp; Creatures: and therefore being fallen he still retey∣ned
fredom of will.</HI> Gen: 3. 23. 24. is in parte doubtfully set down, and in
parte, vntrue.</P>
<P>That <HI>Adam</HI> had as well freedom of will after, as before his fall, is, as true,
as that he was a man after, as before. For take away will from a man, &amp; he
ceaseth to be a man: and take away freedom from the will, in that which it
willeth, &amp; it ceaseth to be will. But here is the difference, that the same na∣turall
power of freewill, which before, was rightly ordered, &amp; disposed one∣ly
to good actually, (though changeably) was afterwards corrupted, disor∣dered
&amp; clean cōtrarily disposed, till by supernaturall grace it was rectifyed,
&amp; renued. It is true then, that sin destroyeth not the naturall powers, or
parts of soul, or body, but onely corrupteth, infecteth, &amp; disordereth them:
whence also ariseth in the mynde, ignorance, errour, doubtinges, &amp; vnbe∣leef;
&amp; in the will, &amp; affections, perversnes, &amp; disorder, with manifold
lusts, to the fullfilling &amp; execution whereof, the bodily instruments are di∣sposed.
But the reason brought, <HI>that sin can not abolish Gods work, or Creatures,</HI>
is frivolous: For God suffering sin to enter, suffereth therein an abolition
of his own work &amp; creature. It is confessed, Propos: 11. <HI>That Adam sinning,
dyed the death, &amp; lost innocency, peace of Conscience, &amp; the comfortable presence of God.</HI>
Now was not this spirituall death which Adam dyed, an abolition, &amp; de∣struction
of his spirituall life, innocency, &amp;c: works of God, &amp; his creatu∣res?
the same may be sayd of the whole Image of God. What were these but
workes of God, creatures, &amp; created graces, &amp; endowments, wrought in
him, &amp; bestowed on him by the hand of the Creatour, which sin abolished
both in him, &amp; in his posterity by naturall propagation? as will appear in
the refutation of the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Conclusions: which is,</P>
<P>That Originall sin is an idle term, &amp; that there is no such thing as men intend by<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 8 Con∣clusion.</NOTE>
the word. <HI>Eze:</HI> 18. 20. Because God threatned Death onely to Adam. <HI>Gen:</HI> 2. 17.
not to his posterity, &amp; because God created the soul. <HI>Heb:</HI> 12. 9.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="58"/>
That Originall sin is an hereditary evill, I shall prove hereafter, (God
assisting) and do answer to the Scriptures; &amp; frist to that in Ezech: <HI>The soul
that sinneth shall dy, the sonne shall not bear the iniquitie of the father.</HI> The Prophet
speakes of such children as forsake sin, &amp; repent, as the whole context
sheweth, which was to reprove the hypocrisy of the Iewes, who complay∣ned
of injustice from God in punishing them, who were holy, for their fa∣thers
sins. Besides, all Adams naturall posterity were souls sinning in him:
whom in that his sin, we must not consider as a private person, but as the
common father of mankinde, communicateing with the nature, the sin
(which was not merely personall, but naturall) with his naturall posteritie:
both which are also their own, as on the cōtrary, the second <HI>Adam Christ,</HI>
&amp; his righteousnes is so communicated with the members of his body, as
every faithfull person may truely say, that both he, &amp; it are his. And hence
was it, that in the punishment of this sin, the earth was cursed; not to him
alone, but to his ensueing posterity: neyther was <HI>Eve</HI> alone to suffer the sor∣rowes
of conception, &amp; childbirth, but all her daughtes after her: neyther
were the <HI>Cherubims</HI> set to keep them two alone, but all their after posterity
out of the gardē of Eden: &amp; so is it for death it self, &amp; all the passages which
lead vnto it: according to that of the Apostle, <HI>as by one man sin entered into the
world &amp; death by sin, even so death went over all men, in whom all have sinned.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom 5. 12.</NOTE> Where
they further alleadge, <HI>that because God created the soul,</HI> that is doth immediate∣ly
create the soul of every particular person: Hebr: 12. 9. <HI>ther, is therefore no
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riginall sin</HI> they take too much liberty both for the exposition of the Scrip∣ture,
&amp; their inference vppon it, shewing no reason for the one, or other.</P>
<P>First then by<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>flesh.</HI> Heb: 12. 9. (for so it should be turned, &amp; not <HI>bodyes</HI>) is

soules without bodyes, since God is the father of the bodyes of mē, &amp; of all
creatures, <HI>Iob: 38. 28. Luk.</HI> 3. 35. but as by <HI>flesh</HI> is oft in the Scriptures ment
earthly things (for which our naturall parēts trayn vs vp, &amp; correct vs) &amp; as
God is our spirituall Mayster, &amp; guide, to the meaning may well be, that if
for the conveniency of this life, we submit to the chasticemēt of our earthly
father, much more ought we to humble our selves to the discipline of our
heavēly father, for spirituall things. 2<SUP>dly</SUP> since they generally who think the
soul to be created immediately, &amp; infused, do not onely hold <HI>Originall sin,</HI>
but also shew how they conceiv it to be propogated, it is but presumption in
these men (<HI>without answering what others so ordinary bring to the contrary</HI>) thus to
conclude, that because the soul is thus immediately created, therefore there
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s no originall sin. But as I see small reason to persuade me, that the dead
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody, before the soul be vnited with it, can be the proper subject of sin,
<PB N="108" REF="59"/>
or meanes to traduce it, or indeed any way sinfull, more then after it be
separated from the soul: and lesse reason, that the same body can infect the
soul, being of spirituall nature, with any contagion of sin, though it might
hinder, or fayl it, in some outward exequution; so seemeth it to me much
more agreable vnto truth, that the <HI>blessing of God to encrease, &amp; multiply</HI> did as
well geve vertue, &amp; power vnto mankynde, as vnto other kyndes, to beget,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. 28.</NOTE>
&amp; generate their like: &amp; not onely a dead carkas, &amp; livelesse body, inferiour
to the issue of bruit beasts, which do procreate their kynde, both body &amp;
soule, or life. Neyther see I how <HI>Adam</HI> could be sayd to have <HI>begotten a sonne
after his own Image,</HI> Gen: 5. 3. opposed to Gods <HI>Image</HI> v: 1. that is, sinfull,
and corrupt, if he onely had begotten the body, &amp; not the soul also: which
I think he did, even the whole, the whole; after a maner convenyent to ey∣ther
nature. And if these two Positions can not stand together, that God
createth the soul immediately: &amp; that there is <HI>originall sin:</HI> where these men
conclude, that there is therefore no <HI>originall sin,</HI> I conclude contrary wise,
that therefore the soul is not immediately created, nor the place to the
Heb: so to be expounded; since the proufes for <HI>originall sin</HI> are so certayn, &amp;
evident.</P>
<P>And that it is no idle term, (as is imagined) but a miserable calamity
possessing all the posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> by naturall generation, &amp; ever by them
to be bewayled, &amp; purged out, I hope playnly to prove, &amp; with all, that by
reason of it they are naturally vnable to chuse, or will any thing spiritually
good, or truely pleasing God.</P>
<P>And for this, (remembring what I have formerly noted from Rom: 4.
12. about all mens sining in that one &amp; first man) observe we, that these
men confesse every where, &amp; truely, that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. 5.</NOTE> <HI>a man must be regenerate, or borne
anew, before he can enter the kingdom of God.</HI> wherevppon it followeth necessa∣rily,
that by the first birth, &amp; generation all men are excluded from the
kingdom of God. And if by the first birth men be not corrupt, then is not
the second birth simply necessary: but all are rather to indevour to pre∣serve
the purity of the former. And this myne argument is further confir∣med,
where Christ our Lord teacheth, that, <HI>that which is borne of the flesh, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
flesh,</HI> that is sinfull, which he therefore opposeth to the <HI>spirit:</HI> and so the se∣cond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3. 6.</NOTE>
or <HI>new birth</HI> by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> required for that <HI>entring the kingdom of heaven,</HI>
to the first, or old birth, by which all men are naturally excluded. And the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom 3. 23.</NOTE>
same it is which we read, Ioh: 1. v: 12. 13. that <HI>the sonnes of God are borne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<PB N="109" REF="59"/>
to the fountayn, doth confesse that <HI>he was born in iniquity, &amp; conceived in sin.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.</NOTE>
Ioyn with all these that, which the testifyeth both of Iewes, &amp; Gentiles,
that <HI>they were by nature children of wrath,</HI> that is born such, as the word <HI>nature</HI>
importeth. Hence is it that <HI>Iude</HI> speaking of such deceavers, as had <HI>crept</HI> into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph.</NOTE>
the Church, &amp; taken vppon them the profession of Christ, &amp; after <HI>turned
that grace of God into wantonnes</HI> calles them <HI>corrupt &amp; rotten trees, &amp; twice dead,</HI>
v: 4. 12. who had they not been first <HI>dead</HI> in <HI>Adam</HI> in <HI>trespasses, &amp; sins.</HI> Eph:
2. 1. how could they have been <HI>twice dead?</HI> Ad we vnto these the conside∣ration
of the Circumcision of the Lords people of ould, livelily teaching,
that nothing comeing of mans vncleane seed naturally, could be clean, as
<HI>Iob</HI> sayth, which was also further declared in the vncleannes, &amp; so in the
purification of every woman after Child birth, by burnt offeringes, &amp; sin
offerings.</P>
<P>Lastly even common sence, &amp; experience, which teacheth the most sim∣ple,
confirmeth this doctrine of <HI>originall sin.</HI> Who seeth not in children even
from their cradels, the fruit of this bitter root? crying (as <HI>Austin</HI> confes∣seth
of himself) to be avenged of their nurses, being naturally prone to ly∣ing,
for complaints, or excuses, though so brought vp, as they hear no ly
tould: also prydeing themselves in any gay, or gorgeous thing, &amp; despise∣ing
others which want the like: and so evident is this to sence, &amp; experien∣ce,
as that the fyre is warme, &amp; a stone heavy.</P>
<P>Now the same Scriptures which prove this naturall, &amp; originall sin,
serv also to disprove all originall, &amp; naturall freedom of will or other power
to any good thing truely spirituall, or pleasing God. I will apply some of
the forenamed Scriptures, &amp; ad some others to that purpose.</P>
<P>And first, since all <HI>must be regenerate, or begot, &amp; borne anew, before they can
enter, or see, the kingdom of heaven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> this wholy difarmeth the naturall man of

also be of the whole, &amp; of all the parts, as is the first generation. Agreable
wherevnto is that Eph: 2. 1. where all are sayd to be <HI>dead in tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spasses, &amp; sins.</HI>
These mē graunt it of Adam, by his offence: &amp; that Scripture, with others,
teach the same of all men by nature, &amp; <HI>through</HI> that his <HI>one offence.</HI> And as no
motion, or action of naturall life, can possibly be made, or performed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> by
a man naturally dead; so neyther any spirituall motion, or action, by any
dead spiritually, till God breath into him anew that his <HI>quickening spirit, the
spirit of lyfe.</HI> And as of things vnknowen there is no desyre, or will, so is it
not possible that the <HI>naturall</HI> or animall <HI>man</HI> (for that title is geven him of
his more noble parte the soul) which knowes <HI>not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 8. 5.</NOTE> nor is <HI>capable of the things
of the spirit,</HI> being <HI>discerned spiritually,</HI> should will, or desire them. Yea being
<PB N="110" REF="60"/>
offered by the preaching of the Gospell, they are <HI>foolishnes vnto him, &amp; things</HI>
which <HI>he savoreth not: the very wisdom,</HI> or myndeing <HI>of the flesh</HI> being <HI>enmity
against God,</HI> with is not subject to the law of God, nor <HI>indeed can be.</HI> If it be
asked why doth God then require it should be, or punish men where it is
not? it is easely answered, that this inability cometh by mans own defalt.
God made all men in Adam able to keep the law: &amp; the obedience there∣of
is due debt vnto God: now the inability of the debtour, &amp; his heyrs
(especially by their own default) is no sufficient discharge of the debt
vnto the Creditour who lent it: so neyther doth mans inability preiudice
the Lords right, but that he may in the course of iustice, require that obe∣dience
to his holy law, vnto which by creation he enabled mankynde.
And for fayth in Christ, &amp; repentance, (which are the summe of the Go∣spell)
God doth not requyre them, as due from the creature, to a Crea∣tour,
by order of iustice, but as conditions convenient vnto man, <HI>dead in
sin</HI> &amp; misery, if he wilbe made partakers of that <HI>Life &amp; light come into the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>
<HI>world;</HI> &amp; offered by Christ: which whilst men dispise, <HI>loueinge darknes more
then light because their works are evill:</HI> their condemnation followeth vp∣pon
their impenitency, &amp; vnbeleif, as doth the death of a wounded
man vppon his wilfull contempt of the sovereign salve offered for his
healing.</P>
<P>To conclude then, they of whom God requires this fayth, repentance,
&amp; obedience, eyther yeald it him answerably, or not? If not; as they can
not, so their own hearts &amp; consciences will witnes agaynst them, that they
will not; but do on the contrary willingly withstand, &amp; with draw from the
Lords commandements: who are therefore inexcusable, &amp; have no cause
to complayn, save vppon themselves. And for them who yeald submission
by the effectuall work of Gods <HI>spirit writing faith &amp; the law in their harts,</HI> much
lesse have they cause of complayning agaynst God, but onely of thankesge∣veing
for the grace received,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3.</NOTE> by which he hath even <HI>created them anew as his
workmanship: not being fit of themselves, as of themselves, so much as to think
a good thought, but haveing God workeing in them both the will, &amp; deed, accord∣ing
to his good pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>It is added,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</NOTE> that <HI>if Originall sin might have passed from Adam to his posterity yet</HI>
is the issue thereof stayed by Christs death, which was effectuall, &amp; he the lamb of God
slayn from the begining of the world. <HI>Apoc:</HI> 13. 8.</P>
<P>I answer that he was indeed from eternity <HI>that lamb of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 29</NOTE> in tyme
to be <HI>slayn:</HI> but <HI>to take away the sins of the world,</HI> as <HI>Iohn</HI> witnessed of him: and
so his death was effectuall. It is confessed, &amp; truely, <HI>Conclus: 30. That
Christ is become the Mediator of the new Testament, &amp; Priest of the Church.</HI> This
<HI>new Testament, is established in his blood:</HI> and he a Priest for vs, as he offered,
<PB N="111" REF="60"/>
and gave him self a Sacrifice, &amp; Ransom for vs: and this bloodshed was
for the washing away of sins: this Sacrifice for procureing Pardon: and
this Ransom for the freing of them, that are taken captive by sin, and
Sathan. This stopping then of the issue of sin, as it is intended, is but a
fiction.</P>
<P><HI>That Infants are</HI> (as is further affirmed) <HI>conceived, &amp; born in innocency
without sin</HI> is contrary to the Scriptures:<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clusi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> as, that <HI>they are all vndoubtedlie

brought to prove it, which are Gen: 5. 2. &amp; 1. 27. compared with
1. Cor: 15. 49. I answer that by <HI>the Image of the earthly Adam,</HI> in the last Scrip∣ture
is not meant the <HI>Image of God, in wisdom, righteousnes, &amp; holynes,</HI> accord∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3 Eph. 4</NOTE>

blood,</HI> which <HI>cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven:</HI> and <HI>corruption,</HI> which <HI>cannot
inherit incorruption.</HI> It should rayther be mynded, that <HI>Moses</HI> speaking of

speaking of him after his fall, &amp; of his estate then, sayth that <HI>he begat</HI> a sonne

from <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 15. that <HI>Where there is no law there is no transgression, or sin.</HI>
and agayn from Rom: 5. 13. Math: 13. 9. Neh: 8. 3. that <HI>the law was not gi∣ven
to Infants, but to them that could vnderstand.</HI> I answer, that the law is eyther
given vocally, &amp; in the letter spoken, &amp; written, &amp; so it is not given to In∣fants,
no nor to thousands of men, &amp; woemen in their persons: or written
in the heart by creation with the finger of God: &amp; so all Infants have it gi∣ven,

corrupted are averse, &amp; disposed to all disobedience, even as the whelpes, &amp;
cubs of foxes, &amp; wolves, are disposed to pray, &amp; raven from the first, though
they cannot actually so practise. Besides in Adam the cōmon father of man∣kynde

the gallowes. <HI>Ezech: 33. 11. Gen: 1. 21. 15. 49. Gen: 5. 3. must be received
with sundry limitations.</HI></P>
<P>For first it is true, that God hateth nothing that he hath made, so far as
it is his worke: but as sin comeing in hath destroyed the worke of God,
though not in respect of the nature, or being, yet of the integrity, &amp; holy
being of the creature; so God, through his vnchangeable holynes, hateing
sin, doth also most fervently hate, &amp; abhor from the sinfull creature, in
whom it reigneth, in respect of it, as the † Scriptures do expressely, &amp; plen∣tifully<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al. 2. 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l 5. 6.</NOTE>
teach. And God loveing himself, &amp; his own holynes in the first
place, &amp; most, and the creature, &amp; his good, but in the second place, the
love of the creature must give way to the love of himself, and so he necessa∣rily<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 16. 5 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1. 16.</NOTE>
hate the obstinate sinner. And this it is most needfull for all men firme∣ly
to beleve, &amp; continually to bear in mynde, that they may alwayes be∣wayle
their sins, &amp; nourish in themselves the hatred of that, which God so
hateth, &amp; for it, the creature; &amp; for which he punisheth it with most horri∣ble
curses, &amp; punishments for ever.</P>
<P>And yet even in the very exequution of his most fearefull vengeance
vppon the reprobate, men, &amp; Angels, he retayneth the generall love of a
Creatour; &amp; out of it preserveth the being of the creature, which in it self,
&amp; in respect of the vniversall is better then not to be, though not so in the
sence of the person: &amp; also moderateth the extremity of that torment,
which he both could, &amp; might in iustice inflict.</P>
<P>Secondly though God do love all men even sinning, as he did Adam
sinning, yet not with the same degre of love wherewith he loved him: ney∣ther
doth he seek their good, as he did his. When he had sinned, &amp; so fled
<PB N="113" REF="61"/>

recovery, preached vnto him the Gospell of salvation in <HI>the seed of the wo∣man:</HI>
and not onely so, but gave him also an heart to beleve his promise;

(even the bodie of the Gentiles to speake of, before Christ, &amp; how many

of Christ vouchsafed to many others) <HI>they might perish by Gods iudge∣ment:</HI>

<P>Secondly it is also true that <HI>God doth not cast away his innocent creature nor
hath created or predestinated any man to destruction,</HI> to wit eyther remayning as
he created him, or because he would destroy him: and this, some of the
Scriptures, Conclus: 25 do prove, the rest being impertinent: but that God<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phy 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2 Tim. 2 25.</NOTE>
hath from eternity decreed the condemnation of some for sin, forepurpo∣sed
by him to be suffered, &amp; so foreseene to be wrought by man, is evident,
both by the word of God, as <HI>Iude</HI> testifyeth of <HI>of certain worked men</HI> that they
were <HI>ordeyned of ould to condemnation:</HI> &amp; God is sayd to have <HI>hated Esau, before
he was borne:</HI> that is to have purposed the hatred of him for his sin, fore∣seene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 3. 4. Mala. 1. 3 Rom 9. 11 13.</NOTE>
&amp; forepurposed to be suffered: and also by the worke of God, in
that he doth in tyme, cast away, &amp; condemn impenitent sinners: for<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Act. 15. 18.</NOTE> <HI>all
Gods workes are knowen vnto him from the begining of the world:</HI> and Gods very
doing a thing in tyme, is an vnanswerable proof that he purposed the same
thing before tyme, &amp; from eternity.</P>
<P>And for Gods forsakeing, or leaving a man vnto himself; as he vsually
doth it, for a punishment of former sins, so did he thus leave <HI>Adam</HI> with∣out
<PB N="114" REF="62"/>
out any such respect. He could (if he would) eyther have kept him from
being tempted, or have delivered him out of his temptation, by his al∣mighty
power, &amp; grace, &amp; the irresistable efficacy of his spirit: but God,
for the tryall of the will of man, &amp; to manifest how weak the most excel∣lent
creatures are not dependeing wholy vppon the Creatour, &amp; not seek∣ing
their good &amp; happynes, by cleaving vnto him, the cheif, &amp; vnchange∣able
good: as also to make way to the further declaration of his mercie, &amp;
iustice, did suspend, &amp; withhold from <HI>Adam</HI> in his temptation, that effi∣cacy
of grace, by which he could (if he would) have established him vnte∣sistably
vnto perseverance.</P>
<P>So also could God by his alsufficient power (if such his good will were)
recover thousandes, that perish in, &amp; by their sins: otherwise he were not
almighty: not that true, which is sayd of him in the Psalm, <HI>He doth whatsoe∣ver</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 115. 3</NOTE>
<HI>pleaseth him.</HI> Besides, it should els sollow, that sin, &amp; Sathan were stron∣ger
then he: &amp; which he could not possibly defeat, &amp; withstand: which is,
as impossible, as that God should not be God. He is <HI>able</HI> by his almighty<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 3. 8.</NOTE>
power, if such his good pleasure be to <HI>rayse of the very stones children vnto

&amp; sensible, &amp; to <HI>write</HI> in it, his will, &amp; <HI>law.</HI></P>
<P>And what the Lords power is, in <HI>remedying,</HI> &amp; recovering of most despe∣rate
sinners, may be seen in some particulars. In the recovery of <HI>Manasseh</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King 21 12. 16.</NOTE>
an hortible, &amp; apostate Idolatour, a vile sorcerer, &amp; witch, &amp; most cruell

with 7 Divels: &amp; of <HI>Saul, a persequuter, blasphemer, &amp; oppressour,</HI> &amp; that when
the fyre of most violent persequution burned hottest in his brest: causing
him to <HI>breath</HI> out of his mouth <HI>threatnings, &amp; slaughter,</HI> as smoake, Act. 9 1.
And since all men <HI>are by nature children of wrath, &amp; dead in sins,</HI> so that they
who are the Lords, have new life put into them, yea are borne, yea which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph 2. 2.</NOTE>
is more, created anew, it sheweth, that the whole being, &amp; life of the spi∣rituall
man, with all the motions, &amp; inclinations thereof, are of Gods spe∣ciall
&amp; supernaturall grace; as also that though men in themselves be vtter∣ly
remedilesse, &amp; irrecoverable, yet are they by Gods grace, &amp; power reco∣verable,
if such his good will be.</P>
<P>The Scriptures Isa: 5. 4. Ezech: 18. 23. &amp; 33. Luk: 13. 6. 9. speak of
the Lords dealing with his Church in the outward ministery of the word,
&amp; other common motives to repentance: as is also further manifest
Math: 21. 33. 34. &amp;c. &amp; so are neyther to be vnderstood (as here they
are) of the Lords dealing with all men, nor at all of the vttermost effica∣cy
of his spirit, when he pleaseth to worke by it what he can for the recove∣ry
of sinners.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="62"/>
Lastly touching the similitude brought from a naturall father, I must
vse two limitations: the former that a naturall <HI>father</HI> would <HI>not suffer his
sonne to come to the gallowes,</HI> or desert thereof, if he could possibly in his vt∣most
power hinder it: he would rather wish not to beget him at all, or
that he might never be born: but so is it notwith God, who both willing∣ly
produceth, &amp; preserveth the creature, whom he purposeth to destroy
for sin, which he foreseeth the creature will work, &amp; suffereth him to fall
into, though he could (would he vse the vtmost of his power,) hinder
both the sin, &amp; punishment. And 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, the hanging of the childe is no way
to the honour of his naturall father, but to his greif, &amp; shame every way:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 10. 20.</NOTE>
but on the contrary, the destruction of the wicked for their sins is to the
great glorie of the iustice of the Creatour, which then it should not be ma∣gnifyed,
better all men &amp; Angels perish.</P>
<P>Touching this Conclusion, <HI>God hath</HI> not onely <HI>determined before the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Con∣clus.</NOTE>
<HI>world, that the way of salvation shalbe by Christ: and foreseen who would follow it,</HI>
(as they teach) but hath also determined in particular, whom he would
effectually call to the participation of that grace: which being his own
worke in tyme, he hath therefore purposed before tyme. It is he that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Math. 11. 26.</NOTE> <HI>revea∣leth</HI>
this way vnto man from <HI>heaven:</HI> which <HI>flesh &amp; blood cannot</HI> do: who also
must<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Eph. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 9. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rom 9. 11. 15.</NOTE> <HI>drew</HI> them, who <HI>come</HI> vnto it. And this he doth first by sending his
<HI>Gospell of Salvation</HI> to such, as are his (in his decre) Act: 13. 47. 48. &amp; Ch:
18. 9. 10. then by <HI>opening the heart</HI> (as of <HI>Ldia</HI>) <HI>to listen vnto it.</HI> Act: 16. 4.
&amp; so workeing in their hearts by his spirit to beleev &amp; obay it, he perfecteth
their happynes in glory. Rom: 8. 30. 31. So that God foreseeth that such,
&amp; such will beleve, &amp; chuse the way of life, because he forepurposeth to give
them this grace, knowledg, will, &amp; power to beleve, &amp; to chuse the good
way: &amp; all this of his <HI>good</HI> &amp; gracious <HI>pleasure</HI> towards them, <HI>on whom he will
shew mercie.</HI> And this the places brought by those men. Eph: 1. 4. 5. 2. Tim:
1. 9. do most directly prove: so also doth Iude, 4. expressely teach, <HI>not that
God foresaw who would follow the way of infidelity &amp; impenitency,</HI> for which they
alleadg it: but whom God hath <HI>foreordeyned to condemnation</HI> for their <HI>wickednes.</HI>
The Scriptures, then do no where prove any such idle foresight in God, as
is imagined by these men, &amp; others: as if God were in truth, but a progno∣sticator,
&amp; reader of mens destinyes: who could onely fortell, what should
be done by, &amp; become of these, &amp; these men.</P>
<P>Touching 27<SUP>th</SUP> Conclus: That <HI>as God created all men according to his Image, so
hath he redemed, all that fall by actuall sin, to the same end: &amp; that God in his redemption</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concl. 27, 28,</NOTE>
<HI>hath not swarved from his mercy, which he manifested in his creation:</HI> &amp; that part of
Concl: 28. where it is sayd, <HI>that God in his love to his enemies gave Christ to dy, &amp;
so bought them that deny him;</HI> sundry things are to be observed.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="63"/>
And first, that God did not manifest any mercy, but onely goodnes, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">ANS.</NOTE>
the creation: for mercy presupposeth misery in him towards whom it is
shewed. Secondly it is no swarving at all of Gods goodnes, if he extend
not the grace of redemption to as many as he did the grace of creation:
for then Christ should have redeemed the <HI>Angels,</HI> (who were partakers of
a greater grace of creation:) which he <HI>in no sorte did.</HI> And if God, did in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 2. 16.</NOTE>
iustice paste by the <HI>Angels</HI> that sinned: might he not in the same iustice
have passed by men also? And if he might in iustice have passed by all,
(where he could not in iustice, nor possibly create one man vnjust) as no
man will deny but our redemption by Christ, was a worke of Gods <HI>mercy,</HI>
&amp; not of his iustice) is it injustice in him to passe by some, who also on
their parte <HI>take pleasure in vntighteousnes,</HI> &amp; to continue in their estate of
impenitency, &amp; vnbeleef, <HI>loveing darkenes more then light, because then workes
are evill?</HI></P>
<P>Of the Scriptures brought: first, that of Ioh: 1. 3. shewes that by
Christ, to wit, as God, <HI>all things were made,</HI> or created, which is nothing to
the present matter. And where vers: 16. he sayth, <HI>of his fulnes we all have re∣ceived,
&amp; grace, for grace,</HI> he speaks not of all men, but onely of all those, who
<HI>receive</HI> Christ, &amp; <HI>beleve in his name,</HI> as <HI>vers:</HI> 12. &amp; <HI>are borne of God. vers:</HI> 13. So
2. Cor: 5. 19. by the <HI>world</HI> which <HI>God reconciled to himself in Christ,</HI> are not
meant all that actually sin, but such as <HI>by the word of reconciliation preached
vnto them, &amp; beleeved by them, have their sins forgeven them.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>all men</HI> 1. Tim: 2. 6. is meant all sortes of men, as well Kings, &amp; Ma∣gistrates,
whom, because they were for the present, persequutours of the
Saints, it seems some thought they were not to pray for, as for others, <HI>vers.</HI>
1. he exhorts to pray for all men: &amp; <HI>vers:</HI> 2. he shewes his meaning to be for
all sorts, as <HI>Kings, &amp; them in autority vnder them,</HI> whom <HI>vers:</HI> 4. he sayth <HI>God
would have saved</HI> as well as others: as for whom <HI>Christ dyed,</HI> &amp; so redeemed
them, as well as others. Of Ezech: 33. I have spoken formerly, as also of
Ioh: 16.</P>
<P>By the enemyes spoken of Rom: 5. 10. are meant onely such, as are in
tyme actually reconciled to God, &amp; saved: as appears plainly, if the place
be well considered; whom God is sayd to love, &amp; that not which the com∣mon
love of a Creatour towards the creature, but with the love of a Rede∣mer,
in respect of his decre of love, (&amp; not of the actuall application of it)
as he is sayd to have <HI>loved Iacob, &amp; hated Esau, before they were borne:</HI> Actually
he did not hate, or love the one, or other, neyther doth or can God love
actually wicked men so remayning Psal: 5. 5. 6. Lastly Christ is sayd. 2. Pet:
2. 2. to have <HI>bought those deceaveers,</HI> in respect of the former profession of ho∣lynes,
which they made: by which in the judgement of Charity, they were
<PB N="117" REF="63"/>
so esteemed: as appears evidently in <HI>Iude,</HI> who speaking of the same per∣sons
sayth <HI>vers:</HI> 3. they were <HI>vngodly men crept</HI> into the Church.</P>
<P>Now for Christs Redemption, it must be knowen, that the word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Redemption,</HI> vsed in the Scriptures, is borrowed from the custome
of freeing prisoners, taken in war, from death, or bondage, by paying a
iust price, or ransom for them. And so to affirm that <HI>Christ hath reaeemed all
that fall by actuall sin,</HI> is to affirm, that he hath payed a price to the iustice of
God, for all such, &amp; freed them from the guilt, &amp; bondage of sin, &amp; Sathan:
&amp; so consequently, that all who have sinned actually, have fayth, &amp; repen∣tance:
without which they cannot have forgivenes of sins, nor freedom
from the bondage, &amp; guilt thereof. It is confessed (&amp; truely) Conclus: 35.
<HI>That the efficacy of Christs death is onely derived to thē which mortify their sins,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3. Act. 10 43. 2. Cor. 17.</NOTE>
and therein directly graunted that Christs death is not effectuall for all mē:
and that it is in it self sufficient for all, (being the death of him that was
<HI>God,</HI> Act: 20. 28.) we acknowledg: as also that no particular person (not
haveing sinned agaynst the holy Ghost) can be excluded eyther by himself,
or vs, from the number of them, for whom Christ dyed. It were agaynst
fayth to pray that God would save all the men, that are, &amp; shalbe in the
world to the end thereof: but love teacheth me to pray for any person par∣ticularly,
vppon occasion.</P>
<P>Now for that these men alledg <HI>Rom:</HI> 5. to prove that <HI>Christ redeemed all
who sin actually:</HI> and <HI>M<SUB>r</SUB> Helw:</HI> &amp; others much insist vppon the same place,
to prove that he redeemed all, who sinne in <HI>Adam:</HI> and so would have <HI>a fre∣will</HI>
though not by nature, which they dislike, but by grace given to all: as
if Turkes, and Pagans, and all the wicked world were in <HI>Christ,</HI> and so free
from <HI>condemnation</HI> Rom: 8. 1. and they who had <HI>crucifyed the flesh and the
lusts thereof:</HI> Gal: 4. 24. which they must be, before they can be partakers
of the grace of God through Christ, or of any frewill through him: <HI>Ioh:</HI> 15.
5. I will playnly, and briefly prove (the Lord assisting me) that the Apostle
intends neyther the one, nor the other, but the contrary.</P>
<P>The Apostles meaning there is to shew the priviledges of the faythfull:
that notwithstanding all their afflictions, <HI>They have peace with God: accesse</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 2. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>
<HI>vnto his grace and hope of glorie.</HI> having by fayth assurance of <HI>the love of God
shed into their hearts by the holy Ghost.</HI> This love of God he confirmeth vnto
them, by the work of their <HI>redemption:</HI> and proveth that since out of the
love of God, <HI>Christ dyed for them when they were sinners, &amp; instifyed them by his</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>
<HI>blood, much more should they be saved from wrath through him,</HI> and that if <HI>when</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 10</NOTE>
<HI>they were enemyes, they were reconciled to God by the death of his sonne, much more be∣ing
reconciled they should be saved by his lyfe:</HI> and agayne, <HI>That they who had re∣ceived</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 17</NOTE>
<HI>that abundance of grace, &amp; gift of righteouses, should reigne in lyse by Iesus
<PB N="118" REF="64"/>
Christ:</HI> and in the last place, that, <HI>that Grace should reign through righteous∣nes
vnto eternall lyfe by Iesus Christ our Lord.</HI> Which grace he also amplyfieth,
and confirmeth by comparing <HI>Christ</HI> as the 2<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>Adam,</HI> with the first <HI>Adam:</HI>
teaching that both the one, &amp; the other did, &amp; do propagate to all theirs,
what theirs was: the first <HI>Adam,</HI> sin, &amp; death to all comeing of him natu∣rally:
the 2<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>Adam Christ,</HI> righteousnes, &amp; eternall lyfe to all that are in
him spiritually, &amp; for whom he died. The meaning thē of the Apostle seems
vnto me plainly to be this: that for whomsoever <HI>Christ</HI> did indeed and ef∣fectually
dy, they should certainly be saved: &amp; that whomsoever God did
reconcile by his death, he will much more save by his lyfe, notwithstand∣ing
their afflictions &amp; all other the enemyes of their salvation: &amp; so to be
the same in effect with that which the same Apostle hath Rom: 8. 28.
that <HI>all things shall worke together for the best vnto them that love God even vnto
them who are called of purpose:</HI> &amp; that <HI>those who are predestmate are also called, &amp;
iustifyed, &amp; glorifyed:</HI> &amp; vers: 32. 39. that to them, <HI>for whom God hath not spa∣red
to give his sonne, he will give all things with him:</HI> and so victorie over sin, &amp;
Sathan, &amp; their own flesh, with all temptations, so as <HI>nothing shall separate
them from the love of God.</HI></P>
<P>From Rom: 5 then, may be more truely (&amp; I am persuaded vndeniably.)
concluded, these two things. 1. that <HI>Christ</HI> did not effectually dy for, or re∣concile
by his death all men in particular: for then all should be saved by
his lyfe: &amp; 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, that whomsoever he so died for, &amp; effectually reconciled,
they shall be kept by the power of God, &amp; of his grace, vnto eternall lyfe:
yea <HI>He that beleveth in the sonne,</HI> sayth Iohn Baptist, <HI>hath eternall lyfe:</HI> &amp; <HI>drinke∣ing</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 3. 36. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 4. 14</NOTE>
once <HI>of the water</HI> which Christ <HI>giveth, he shall never thrist agayn, but it shall
be in him a well of water, springing vp to eternall lyfe.</HI> A wellspring (we know) is
never wholy dry, though a ditch be: as it is also one thing <HI>to drink of this
water of lyfe: and another thing onely to tast of it:</HI> which they that do, may <HI>fall</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eb. 6. 4. 6.</NOTE>
<HI>away,</HI> as never haveing had their thirst indeed quenched in them, nor ha∣veing
<HI>drunk in the rayn of grace,</HI> as <HI>vers:</HI> 7. And it is well to be observed
by vs, how carefully the Holy Ghost in this, &amp; in other places, pre∣venteth
both the offence at, &amp; errour about mens falling away from their
holy profession.</P>
<P>We read of some in the <HI>parable of the sower</HI> who <HI>receiv the seed of the word
with ioy,</HI> &amp; in whom it hath also got some kyndeof <HI>growth,</HI> and yet they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 13 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. 7. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 21. 22 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 23.</NOTE>
come to nothing: but we fynde in the same place, that the soyl of those
mens hearts, was never indeed good: but at the best, as <HI>stony &amp; thorny

<P><PB N="119" REF="64"/>
So <HI>Paul 2. Tim.</HI> 2. sheweth that some there are, who have their <HI>fayth</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">vers. 1. 19. 20</NOTE>
<HI>destroyed</HI> by <HI>heresyes,</HI> &amp; evill lyfe: but he geves vs to vnderstand in the same

<HI>knowen</HI> of him, <HI>nor vessels of honour,</HI> of <HI>silver,</HI> &amp; of <HI>gould.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> likewise speaketh of some, who denyed the Lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Pet.</NOTE>
that bought them, to wit, being iudged by their former profession, but in
the same place he shewes that the same persons were but indeed <HI>dogs</HI> and

Church and Christians, sayth plainly that they <HI>were not of them,</HI> that is not
of the number of Gods truely <HI>annoynted ones:</HI> and that by their not con∣tinueing
with them it appeared, <HI>they were</HI> never <HI>of them. For they that are
borne of God cannot commit sin, because the seed of Gods word abydeth in them,</HI>
as it followeth in same <HI>Epistle: Chap:</HI> 3. 9. and thus much in effect these
men confesse, when they teach (as the truth is &amp; Scripture proveth) Concl:

<P>To conclude this poynt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they who eyther hould that Christ ef∣fectually
redeemed all from their naturall corruption, or that any
truely iustifyed, and sanctifyed, may wholy fall away and perish, do
devide Christ from himself, and make him a party Saviour: and a
Preist for some to redeem them by his death, to whom he is not a
King to save them by his lyfe: &amp; a Saviour in parte to the very dam∣ned
at the last day: freeing all of them from the guilt of their origi∣nall
sin: and many of them, even from one part of their actuall sins,
namely, so much as they wrought, before the tyme of their falling
away, but not from the rest. Which how vayn a thing it is to imagine,

That <HI>the sacrifice of Christs bodie, &amp; blood offered vnto God his father vppon the

Eph. 2. 14. 16. Rom. 1. 30. is most vntrue, and indeed a very pernitious do∣ctrine,

<P>As one of the Scriptures quoted, which is Rom. 1. 30. speakes of wicked
mens hateing of God, so are the rest meant of Gods hatred towards wic∣ked
men: which they also fully prove. And if the sacrifice of Christs bodie,
&amp; blood vppon the crosse were a sweet smelling savour vnto his father, is it
not evident that we did formerly stinck in Gods nostrils by reason of our
sins? Where he gave himself a sacrifice for vs, was it not to appease the fa∣thers

agaynst God (though that follow vppon the other) but the takeing away of
his hatred &amp; enmitie towards vs, as is evident in that the Apostle in the for∣mer
verse placeth this <HI>reconciliation</HI> in Gods not <HI>imputing our sins vnto vs:</HI> the
end of his exhortation vers: 20. being to provoke vs to the growth of
fayth for the applying of the same. Neyther speaketh he <HI>Eph:</HI> 2 of the <HI>slay∣ing
of the enemitie &amp; hatred in vs agaynst God,</HI> as is sayd: but first of the slaying
of the hatred betweē Iewes, and Gentils, by breaking down <HI>the partition wall of

God hated both, for sin, being the one, &amp; other by <HI>nature children of wrath</HI>
vers: 3. that is vnder the wrath of God, as their deserved inheritance. So
that the chief, &amp; first work of our redemption by Christ is the freeing of vs
from the guilt of sin, &amp; most fearefull wrath of God, by paying the price of
his pretious blood for a ransom to the iustice of his father, thereby pro∣curing
him of a most severe, &amp; fearefull Iudg to become vnto vs a gracious
father, and to love vs vnto life: which love of his <HI>being shed into our hearts by

which the Scriptures do ascribe onely to <HI>faith:</HI> and <HI>the free grace of God,
through that redemption that is in Christ Iesus.</HI> Our redemption then, or in∣stification
properly taken, is in Christ, &amp; not in our selves, as it should be,
if it stood in our sanctification, or the new creature, which is affirmed.
Our sanctification, or renovation is an inseparable work of that fayth by
which we are iustifyed, Act: 15. 9. but doth not answer the rigour of
Gods iustice, nor can present vs innocent, before his iudgement seat, be∣ing

So for the 3<SUP>d</SUP> Scripture: Eph. 4. 12. 13. the Apostles meaning is not
that the godly should have no further need of the Ministerie for their edi∣fication,
when they were <HI>come to a perfit man,</HI> as there he speakes, that is when
they <HI>ceased to be as children, wavering mynded, &amp; caryed about with every wind of
doctrine,</HI> but that they should so vse it, as thereby to bring them to that per∣fit,
&amp; manly estate, and therein to establish them. Neither doth the par∣ticle
<HI>Vntill</HI> importe a ceasing of the vse of the Ministerie when men become
perfit, and growen past that childish waveringnes there reproved, but a
not ceasing before then: as it is also vsed sundry tymes in the Scriptures, as,
1. Tim. 4. 13. Revel, 2. 25. &amp; els where.</P>
<P>In 1. Cor. 13. 10. 12. the Apostle doth not speak of the estate of per∣fection<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers. 8. 9. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. 11.</NOTE>
in this lyfe, but in that to come, when the measure of our knowledg
shalbe <HI>perfit,</HI> which is now but <HI>in parte,</HI> and but as <HI>a childes</HI> in comparison of
<HI>a mans:</HI> as it shall also be immediate, &amp; we <HI>see God face to face:</HI> when there
shallbe no vse of the <HI>glasse</HI> of the word, and ordinances, when <HI>prophecying &amp;
tounges shall cease,</HI> yea when even <HI>fayth, &amp; hope shall cease:</HI> (the things belee∣ved
&amp; hoped for being fully attayned) &amp; onely <HI>love</HI> shall abyde, which is
therefore called the <HI>greatest</HI> of the <HI>three</HI> vers. 13.</P>
<P>The Apostles meaning also 1. Ioh. 2. 27. is greatly mistaken: which is
not that the <HI>anoynting,</HI> or spirit which they <HI>had received,</HI> set them above the
Scriptures, and all outward teachings: but that he needed not teach them,
as ignorant of these things, which by that <HI>anoynting,</HI> or spirit, were sealed
vp vnto their Consciences: as where Paul tels the Thessal: <HI>that he needs not
wryte vnto them of brotherly love, because they were taught of God one to love another,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Thes. 4. 9.</NOTE>
his meaning onely is, that they were not without that grace, but did prac∣tise
it: yet doth he in the very same place vers: 10. <HI>exhort</HI> them <HI>to encrease more
&amp; more.</HI> So doth Iohn also write that his Epistle to teach and admonish
those <HI>anoynted ones</HI> to beware of false <HI>Prophets</HI> &amp; Anti-Christs of whom they
were in danger, as of other evilles.</P>
<P>Two other Scriptures are intended, but so misput, as I can not fynde
which they are, and therefore passe them by; being also assured they can
geve no confirmation to this vayn presumption deceaving vnder a shew of
Angelicall perfection.</P>
<P>The reason to prove the Scriptures vnnecessarie from the inward witnes
of <HI>the Father, Word, &amp; Spirit,</HI> is verie deceitfull: since the inward grace doth
not abolish but establish the outward meanes, by which it is wrought, &amp;
encreased. David had this witnesse in his heart (being a man <HI>after Gods
heart</HI>) and was regenerate, and yet he desires God to <HI>teach him the way of his</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 33. vers. 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 16.</NOTE>
<HI>statutes:</HI> and that he would <HI>open</HI> his <HI>eyes that he might see the marvayles of his
law:</HI> which he professes <HI>he will not forget.</HI> And being driven from the Taber∣nacle,
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>
&amp; visible ordinances of God: how did he bewayl his want, &amp; mise∣ry?
Far was he from this imagined spirituality. The Apostle calles the <HI>Gospell
the power of God to salvation:</HI> and exhorts Timothy to <HI>continue</HI> in it, to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 17.</NOTE>
saveing of himself &amp; others: by the Ministerie whereof, he also laboured <HI>to
present the Corinthians a pure Virgin vnto Christ.</HI> All which places prove the ne∣cessary<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Tim 16.</NOTE>
vse of it till death, even for the most perfit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>And see whether these things lead. The <HI>naturall,</HI> vnregenerate, and vn∣sanctifyed
man, can have no right vse of the Gospell, and holie things: and<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 14.</NOTE>
the spirituall, regenerate, and new creature, needes them not. To whom
then are they geven: or by whom can they be rightly vsed? And behold<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 1. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>

nor <HI>Christ</HI> himself, who was <HI>tempted in all poynts, like as we are, but without sin,</HI>
would yet persuade them, they had no need of their spirituall <HI>armor,</HI> in spe∣ciall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 7.</NOTE>
of <HI>the sword of the spirit, the word of God:</HI> whereof evē Christ himself also in

is <HI>our faith:</HI> and <HI>the foundation</HI> of our fayth, are the writings of the <HI>Apostles,

or will not the enemy of our salvation easily overthrow the building, when<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2</NOTE>
he hath vndermyned the foundation?</P>
<P>Ad to these things, that the Scriptures, the <HI>law</HI> &amp; <HI>gospell</HI> shalbe the <HI>Iudg</HI>
of all, to whom they come. And is any man above his iudge? or if this be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 12. 16. 2. Thes 2. 4. 1. Pet. 18.</NOTE>

stablenes of fayth, and all grace. Which two sorts of men are vsually
opposed as <HI>strong,</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> in the Scriptures: vnto which perfection all<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eb. 5. 12 3. 14. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h 4. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 13. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hil. 3. 15 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 15. 1</NOTE>
must strive to attayn, &amp; not continue alwayes <HI>children,</HI> &amp; <HI>babes,</HI> which is both
shamefull &amp; dangerous.</P>
<P>But for any such perfection in this world, as wherein a man stands not
need continually to renue his repentance, and to purg him self of the rem∣nants
of sin, <HI>casting of the ould man,</HI> and <HI>putting on the new man,</HI> and to grow
in the knowledg, and grace of God by the vse of the Scriptures, and other
Gods ordinances leading thereunto, it is none other but a most daunge∣rous
delusion of that <HI>Prince of darknes transforming himself into an Angel of light.</HI></P>
<P>And to let passe the common infirmities, yea (by occasion) the greater
falles (noted in the Scriptures) of those holy men, of whose perfection the
same Scriptures testify: as also the dayly, monthly, &amp; yearely sacrifices or∣dinarily
to be offered of ould, for all &amp; every one of the congregation, as
evidences of their guilt, Solomon teacheth. 1. King. 8. 46. that <HI>there is us

<HI>who is of the Devill,</HI> yet puts Iohn himself in the number of them, who can

his <HI>race,</HI> he was so cūbred with that his <HI>clogging, &amp; pressing sin,</HI> as that like <HI>a law</HI>
it forced him both from <HI>the good which he would have done,</HI> &amp; to <HI>the evill which
he would not have done,</HI> &amp; that <HI>when he would have done well, evill was present with
him:</HI> though <HI>in his inward man,</HI> that is, so far as he was regenerate (which
was far beyond any now) <HI>he delighted in the law of God, &amp; served it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="68"/>
Lastly, if any in this lyfe come to the perfection of leaveing sinning, they
must also leav praying, &amp; so leav being Christs Disciples; for he hath taught
all his <HI>Disciples</HI> every <HI>Day</HI> to <HI>aske the forgivenes of their trespasses:</HI> yea they must
be past being <HI>Godly:</HI> for, <HI>for this</HI> (because God is mercifull in forgeving sins)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>Every godly man shall pray vnto him in an acceptable tyme.</HI> And lastly they must
be past hope of Christs comeing in glorie: <HI>for every one that hath this hope in</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32</NOTE>
<HI>him, purgeth himself, as he is pure.</HI> So long therefore as we are absent from<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Ioh. 3.</NOTE>
Christ, &amp; till our glorie in him appear, we must still be purging our selves:
which if the filth of sin were not still in vs, lesse, or more, we need not be:
as we must also <HI>grow in grace,</HI> &amp; <HI>edify our selves in our most holy faith,</HI> being (as
we are from the truth) so far from the vaine presumption of any such per∣fection,
as is by these men intended.</P>
<P>That <HI>the outward, or visible Church consists of penitent persons, &amp; beleeving
onely</HI> (opposing them to impenitent and vnbeleevers) and that such one∣ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">64 71 Concl.</NOTE>
are to be baptized, I acknowledg, and the Scriptures brought confirm:
but deny it, opposing beleevers to their infants, which are neyther vnbe∣leevers
&amp; impenitent, nor <HI>innocent,</HI> as is affirmed. The Vineyard, and
Kingdom which was taken from the Iewes, is let out, and geven to vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 43.</NOTE>
in which though no bryars, nor brambles, nor fruitlesse trees might
grow, yet young plants, and impes, not yet bringing forth fruit actual∣ly,
both might, and may: as children might and may be in Gods King∣dom,
though no rebels.</P>
<P>In Conclusion 65 the <HI>visible Church,</HI> is vnfitly called, <HI>a figure of the invi∣sible;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">65 Conclus.</NOTE>
as is <HI>the invisible</HI> vntruely sayd <HI>to consist onely of the spirits of iust, &amp; per∣fit
men.</HI> He who hath in him true fayth, and holines, is a member of the
invisible Church, and the same person makeing holy profession thereof
outwardly, in the order left by Christ, a member of the visible Church:
and the whole man of both, (and not the soul of the one, and bodie of
the other:) though of the invisible in respect of the inward fayth seen
of God: and of the visible in respect of the outward manifestation before
men, ariseing from the former. The Scriptures brought which are Revel:
1. 10. with Chap. 21. 2. 13. 27. speak of the visible Church onely, &amp; so
are impertinent.</P>
<P>The particulars which I deem amisse Conclus: 68. I have noted in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">68 Con∣clus.</NOTE>
56. Proposition: &amp; refer the reader thither.</P>
<P>That the Sacraments have the same use that the word hath, &amp; teach to the
ey of them that vnderstand, as the word teacheth the eares of them, that have<NOTE PLACE="marg">74 Con∣clus.</NOTE>
eares to hear, <HI>Prov:</HI> 2. 12. &amp; that therefore they perteyn no more to Infants,
then the word doth; <HI>is neyther true in all poynts, nor well applyed in
any.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="69"/>
For 1. the word serves to convert men Psal: 19. 7. and is to be mini∣stred
to vnconverted, and prophane persons: which vse the Sacraments
have not, nor must be administred to such. 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, if this (applyed to In∣fants)
were true, then should not circumcision have been administred to
the Israelitish Infants, who had not eares to hear. Yet is the ground good
being rightly layd (vnto which that also Conclus: 73. is agreable, though
the Scriptures be brought hand over head to confirm it.) For as God by
promising Abraham that he would be his <HI>God, &amp; the God of his seed,</HI> preach∣ed
to his ear, so by giveing him, &amp; his seed circumcision, he preached to
his ey, for the ratification of the same promise. And so is it now with vs,
who have received grace to be of the fayth of Abraham, haveing the same
covenant, promise, or Gospell preached by doctrine to our ear, &amp; confirm∣ed
by baptism to our ey, for ourselves, &amp; our seed.</P>
<P>To the 82. Conclus: <HI>that there is no succession in that outward Church but
that all the succession is from heaven, &amp; that the new Creature onely hath the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Con∣clus.</NOTE>
<HI>thing signifyed, &amp; substance, whereof the outward Church, &amp; ordinances are
shadowes,</HI> Col: 2. 16. 17. I answer, 1. That the Apostle Colos: 2. speaks
onely of the Iewish ordinances, which are abolished, and not of the Church
ordinances now. 2<SUP>dly</SUP>, If it be meant that all succession is from heaven im∣mediately,
it is a fantasy: if mediately, then must the outward succession
(to wit of Ministerie) be in the outward Church, whereof it is an ordi∣nance.
And whereas the Church, and new creature are opposed, it is amisse,
since the Church is to consist onely of such men as are in their measure
renewed by the Holy Ghost, and sanctifyed: and if by the <HI>new creature</HI> they
mean any other thing, it is a <HI>new creature</HI> of their own makeing.</P>
<P>In Conclus: 83. <HI>Where the office of the magistrate,</HI> is called a <HI>permissive ordi∣nance</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3 Con∣clusion.</NOTE>
<HI>of God,</HI> is both a contradiction, and evill <HI>speakeing of them in authoritie.</HI>
Where it is called <HI>an ordinance of God,</HI> it is confessed good, for <HI>every creature of
God is good,</HI> and all his ordinances are his creatures; and so, many things are
ascribed to the office of Magistrates in this, and the other Conclus: about it,
which prove it to be good, and lawfull in it self: but where it is made <HI>per∣missive,</HI>
it is condemned as evill: since onely evill is permitted, or suffered
of God.</P>
<P>And where it is objected Prop: 85. <HI>that Christs Disciples must love their
enemyes, &amp; not kill them: pray for them, &amp; not punish them,</HI> &amp;c. I answer, that
the godly Magistrate may do both. Doth not God punish with tempora∣ry
death those that he loveth? and why may not Gods deputyes, the <HI>Gods</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 82. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 6.</NOTE>
vppon earth, be mynded as God herein? When the godly Kings, and go∣vernours
in Israel were commaunded to exequute judgment and iustice vp∣pon
the people for their transgressions, were they commaunded not to
<PB N="129" REF="69"/>
love them, &amp; not to pray for them? When <HI>Mr Smith</HI> in his sicknes, tels his
children (as it is in the end of the booke) <HI>that if he live, he must correct, &amp; be at
them, not because he hates them, but because he loves them, as God did him,</HI> doth he
not answer the objection, &amp; shew the those two may well stand together,
as in the private father, so in the publique father, the Magistrate? Where
agayn it is sayd that <HI>Christs Disciples must with him be persequuted, afflicted, mur∣dered</HI>
&amp;c: <HI>&amp; that by the authority of the Magistrate.</HI> I do answer; that those
things are not simply necessary for all persons, but as God calles men
vnto them. And 2. both the Scriptures, &amp; other Stories do testify that
godly Magistrates themselves, have suffered these thinges for the Lord &amp;
his trueth, &amp; for well doeing: sometymes the inferiour Magistrates, by the
Superiour, &amp; sometymes the Governours by the people vnder them. In∣stances<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex. 3. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 12. 15. vvith Act. 7. 25 &amp; 1 2. 3</NOTE>
we have hereof in Moses, David, Gedeliah, Daniel, Shadrach, Mi∣shael,
&amp; Abed nego, with Nicodemus, &amp; others many mo. And much it
is that these men should acknowledg that Magistrates are to be prayed for,
&amp; geven thanks for, as the Scriptures teach. 1. Tim: 2. 1. 3. &amp; that their
ordinance is of God, &amp; for the good of mankynde, Rom: 13. in the wor∣kes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2. 10. &amp; 16. 1. 2. &amp;c.</NOTE>
whereof they may please God. 2. King: 10. 30. &amp; in all these that it
is a good &amp; lawfull thing, (for no vnlawfull thing is of God, nor pleaseth
him, nor is to be prayed, or geven thankes for) &amp; yet for it should exclu∣de
them from the Church, as not being Christs Disciples. Doth any good<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 18. 8. 9. 12.</NOTE>
&amp; lawfull thing hinder a man from being Christs Disciple, vnto whom all
creatures, &amp; ordinances are sanctifyed, &amp; pure? or are men to be kept out<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2. 3. &amp; 3 12.</NOTE>
of the Church for weldoeing? Surely even as lawfully as to be receaved in
for evill doeing. They ad <HI>that the Magistrate is not to medle with religion, or
matters of conscience, nor to compell men to this, or that forme of religion, because</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 7. 82 Tit. 1. 5</NOTE>
<HI>Christ is the King, &amp; lawgiver of the Church &amp; conscience.</HI> Iam: 4. 12. I answer
that this indeed proves that he may alter, devise, or establish nothing in re∣ligion
otherwise then Christ hath appoynted, but proves not, that he may
not vse his lawfull power lawfully for the furtherance of Christs Kingdom
&amp; lawes. The Prophet Isaias speakeing of the Church of Christ, foretels
<HI>that Kings shalbe her noursing fathers, &amp; Queens her noursing mothers:</HI> which if they
medle not with her, how can they be? And where these men make this the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 49. 23.</NOTE>
Magistrates onely worke, <HI>that iustice, &amp; civility may be preserved amongst men,</HI> the
Apostle teacheth an other end, which is, <HI>that we may lead a peaceable lyfe vnder
them in all godlynes.</HI> It is true they have no power agaynst the lawes, doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Tim. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>
&amp; religion of Christ: but for the same (if their power be of God) they may
vse it lawfully, &amp; agaynst the contrary And so it was in speciall foretold by
<HI>Iohn,</HI> that <HI>the kings of the earth should make the where absolate, &amp; naked, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her
flesh, &amp; burn her with fyre.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="70"/>
This <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helwisse</HI> frivolously interprets <HI>of their spirituall weapons:</HI> which
are no other then the spirituall weapons of all other Christians: besides
that it is contrary to the clear meaning of the H Ghost, which is, that these
kings should first vse their civile power for the <HI>beast,</HI> &amp; <HI>whore,</HI> &amp; after agaynst
them to their destruction.</P>
<P>To conclude this poynt then: both these men, &amp; <HI>M<SUP>r</SUP> Helw:</HI> especial∣ly,
in his whole discourse about this matter labours of the common disease
of all ignorant mē in pleading agaynst the vse of the ordināce by the abuse:
which standes eyther in prohibiting any thing which God hath comman∣ded,
or in commanding any thing which he hath forbidden: as indeed he
hath whatsoever he hath not commanded, eyther expresly, or by conse∣quence,
in his religion, &amp; worship.</P>
<P>Lastly it is not truely affirmed <HI>that Christians must iudg all their causes of
difference amongst themselves, &amp; may not go to law before Magistrates, nor vse an oath.</HI>
For the first head is alleadged 1. Cor: 6. 1. 7.</P>
<P>I answer that Paul doth not there simply forbid the Saints goeing to
law, but goeing to law vnder Infidels: &amp; that wronging, &amp; oppressing one
another, when they should rather have suffered wrong: or at least have ap∣poynted
some able men for arbitratours, to have ended things. Which
course when doubtfull differences of weight do arise, the members of the
Church ought to take, &amp; so to rest in their equall determinations. But what
if none of the Chuch can sufficiently iudg of the things: or setle them in
peace for after posteritie? (as it may well come to passe in cases of inheri∣tance
especially) the matter may &amp; ought quietly, &amp; peaceably to be re∣ferred
to the Magistrates determination. His office being of God, Gods
people may have the sanctifyed vse of any lawfull worke thereof.</P>
<P>Touching an oath. It is not the meaning of our Saviour. Math: 5. 34.
37. nor of his Apostle Iam: 5. 12. absolutely to forbid the vse of it: &amp; to
restreyn all speach to <HI>yea &amp; nay:</HI> for then Christ had broken his own rule in
his so vsuall asseverations of <HI>verily, verily:</HI> or <HI>amen,</HI> which are more then
bare, <HI>yea,</HI> &amp; <HI>nay.</HI></P>
<P>The meaning of Christ was to free the law from the corrupt glosse of
the pharisees, who taught, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it was no byndeing oath, in which the name
of God was not expresly mentioned, but the creatures onely: as it was
both his, &amp; his Apostles meaning to reprove needles swearing in ordinarie
<HI>communication.</HI> Christ our Lord professeth of himself, <HI>that he came not to destroy</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 5. 7.</NOTE>
<HI>the law,</HI> or ten words, <HI>but to fullfill it:</HI> &amp; haveing taken away the curse there∣of
by his Death, to <HI>write the same in our hearts,</HI> that we might also observe
it, &amp; so vse Gods name holily, as a parte thereof. We read how God him∣self<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 31. 32</NOTE>
swore sundry tymes for mans confirmation &amp; assurance. And is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="131" REF="70"/>
man eyther more holy, or better to be trusted then he, that an oath should
be eyther vnholy or greivous to him? We have also for our warrant the
examples of the holy <HI>Patriarks</HI> &amp; <HI>Prophets, Abraham, Isack, Iacob,</HI> &amp; the rest,
sometymes giveing vnto others, &amp; sometymes takeing oathes of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Isa 45. 23.</NOTE>
which being done religiously, was also a part of, &amp; sundry tymes put for
the whole solemn worship of God; &amp; the same not ceremoniall, &amp; shado∣wish;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 12. 16.</NOTE>
wish; but morall &amp; eternall. And since strifes will alwayes be amongest
men, &amp; those many tymes such, as in which no sufficient testimony by men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 6▪ 10.</NOTE>
or other proofe can be had, an oath (wherein God is called to witnes the
truth, &amp; to avenge the contrary) is alwayes of vse: which the Apostle direct∣ly
teacheth Heb: 6. 10. <HI>An oath for confirmation is vnto men an end of all doubts.</HI>
The lawfulnes whereof the same Apos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le doth plainly confirm, by his own
practise, <HI>takeing God for his witnes.</HI> Rom: 1. 9. &amp; agayn. 2. Cor: 1. 13. <HI>take∣ing
God for a record vppon his soul</HI> (that is to be revenged vppon him therein)
that he <HI>lied not</HI> vnto them.</P>
<P>And thus much for this <HI>Conclusion,</HI> wherewith I will also conclude the
book: entreating of God through Christ, that all who seek his trueth in
sincerity, that in the knowledg, &amp; obedience thereof, they may please him,
may both fynde the same, &amp; with myself, mercy &amp; forgivenes in all our
<HI>errours,</HI> &amp; faylinges of this life, which how many they are <HI>no man knoweth,</HI>
nor can know, whilst he <HI>knoweth but in parte,</HI> as all men but do, whilst they
live in this world, <HI>&amp; are absent from the Lord.</HI></P>
