<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>REctum est Regulasui,
&amp; obliqui,</HI> is an un∣deniable
Axiom among
the Mathematicians; the same
may be said of that thrice Noble
Science call'd <HI>Anatomy,</HI> it be∣ing
the Grand Foundation, or if I
may so say, the Corner-stone both
of Physick and Chirurgery, espe∣cially
the latter, it being the <HI>Ba∣sis</HI>
on which we build all our Stru∣ctures
towards the Cure of Distem∣pers,
both External, and Inter∣nal;
for how is it possible we
should pretend to Cure any Inter∣nal
Affect, unless we know what
Part or <HI>Viscera</HI> is affected; the
<PB REF="3"/>
like may be said in Chirurgical
Cases; for what Surgeon can
give a true Prognostick in Wounds,
Vlcers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or Restore Luxated
or Fractured Limbs, or perform
any Manual Operation, without
a true Knowledge of the Oeconomy
of Humane Body; and this ought
not to be a bare Knowledge only of
the Parts, and where they lye (as
many who are unwilling to give
themselves the Trouble of Scruti∣nying
into the more nice Compo∣sition
of them) but we ought also
to know the Figure, Structure,
Vse, what Juices they separate,
and the like, all which the Do∣ctrine
of <HI>Anatomy</HI> teaches; for
to what a prodigious height is the
Art of Medicine improved, since
our most Ingenious and Accurate
Countryman, Doctor <HI>Harvey,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
found out and demonstrated the
Circulation of the Blood; <HI>Jolivi∣us</HI>
the Lymphatick Vessels; <HI>Cas∣per
Assellus</HI> the <HI>Venae La∣cteae;</HI>
and <HI>Haver's</HI> the Articu∣lar
Glands; with many more
great Improvements, which are
too long to mention; nay, the
whole Method of Physick is almost
alter'd; and this Great and No∣ble
Work could ne'er have been per∣form'd,
had those Learned Men
contented themselves with a bare
Knowledge o the Parts only; for
suppose any had a Pile of Build∣ing
to Erect, would they think
you, employ any one who is Ignorant
of what Figure of Size the Stones
or Timber ought to be, and how
to be join'd together? The same
may be said of a Chirurgeon, or
Physician, who is ignorant of <HI>A∣natomy;</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
so that whoever is
willing to perform the Duty of a
Good and Consciencious Surgeon,
ought to know the whole Fabrick
of Man's Body; and that as well
in its perfect, and sound state,
as morbid, that he may re-esta∣blish
Health when lost, and re∣store
unsound Parts to their former
Sanity.</P>
<P>I shall not here Harangue, or
run out in the many Praises which
are due to <HI>Anatomy,</HI> or Treat
of its Origin and Antiquity; it
being already so excellently well
perform'd by the Learn'd Doctor
<HI>Charleton,</HI> in the Preface to his
Anatomic Prelections, but proceed
to the Matter in hand.</P>
<P>Various are the Opinions of Au∣thors,
about the Parts we ought
to begin with, in Anatomical De∣monstrations.
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>Bartholinus</HI> says,
We ought to begin with the Te∣guments,
they being first in view,
then proceed to the <HI>Viscera,</HI> and
Muscles, and lastly, end with
the Bones; and the Reasons he
gives for it, are because the Bones
cannot be examined before they
appear, which they cannot do,
(says he) 'till all the Muscles
are separated from them; others
begin with the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> or
Lower Belly, so proceed to the
<HI>Thorax,</HI> then to the Head, and
lastly, to the Extremities; by
reason the Belly is apt to send forth
in a little time, very noisom and
offensive Smells, which would hin∣der
the Operator from prosecuting
his intended Design: 'Tis true
this is the best way, supposing we
have but one Subject to work on,
<PB REF="5"/>
and that we be obliged to shew all,
or most of the Parts on this one
Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Galen</HI> says we ought to begin
with the Bones, and gives many
Cogent Reasons to prove it; first,
because they serve as Beams or
Supporters of the whole Body. Se∣condly,
they serve to fasten the
Muscles too; for how can we tell
the Origin or Insertion of any Mus∣cle,
if we be wanting in the true
Doctrine of the Bones; nay, all
the Parts seem as if design'd for
their use; for when the Bones
cease to grow, they also put a Pe∣riod
to the growth of all the other
Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Laurentius</HI> says, that in the
Anatomical School of <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI>
the Young Students in
Medicine, always began their
<PB REF="5"/>
Anatomical Course with the <HI>Osteo∣logy,</HI>
and then proceeded to the
Doctrine of the Muscles, several
of which receive their Denomina∣tions
from the Bones, which they
pass by, or lye on, as the <HI>Tibia∣lis
Posticus,</HI> and <HI>Anticus</HI> the
<HI>Peronii, Scapulares, Sterno∣hyoidei,
Mastoideii,</HI> &amp;c.
Lastly, the Knowledge of the
Bones is of that great use to a
Surgeon, that it's impossible for
him to restore well a Fracture or
Dislocation, who is Ignorant of;
the Structure, Figure, Articula∣tion,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Fractured or
Dislocated Bone.</P>
<P>All these Reasons are a suffici∣ent
Inducement to perswade us,
that we ought to begin with the
Skeleton, and then proceed in or∣der,
to the Rest of Man's Body.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
The Skeleton is an Assemblage
of all the Bones of the Body; it's
either Natural, or Artificial; the
Natural, is when the Bones are
all excarn'd, but kept together by
their proper Ligaments; the Ar∣tificial
one, is when the Bones
are Artificially Cleans'd, Whiten'd
and Join'd together by Wiers.</P>
<P>That part of <HI>Anatomy</HI> which
Treats of the Bones, is call'd <HI>O∣steologia,</HI>
which is as much as
to say, A Discourse of the Bones.</P>
<P>We shall in this Tract examins
what belongs to the Bones in ge∣neral,
and what belongs to each
particular; which we shall di∣vide
in several Demonstrations.</P>

BEING A
Compleat Doctrine
OF THE
BONES, &amp;c</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="demonstration">
<HEAD>Demonstration I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bones in General.</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctrine of the Bones
in General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What to be consider'd in the Bones in General.</NOTE> consists in these
Eleven Things, as Defini∣tion,
Substance, Composi∣tion,
manner of Ossification, Vessels,
Nourishment, Differences, Parts, or
Things to be consider'd in the Bones;
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
together with their manner of Arti∣culation,
Number and Use; of all
which in order.</P>
<P><HI>Galen</HI> defin'd a Bone to be the most
hard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antient De∣finition.</NOTE> firm, and terrestrious part of
all the Body. <HI>Laurentius</HI> adds, and
says, That it's ingendred by the for∣mative
Faculty, by reason of great
heat, out of the most crass and ter∣restrious
part of the <HI>Semen,</HI> to serve
as a Foundation to all the Body, and
to give it Shape and Figure; but this
Definition, as it is not compleat e∣nough,
so on the other hand, the
word Faculty, is a Term which they
used to exprese themselves by, when
they were at a loss for an Answer or
Solution to any Question proposed;
besides, it's not at all agreeable to the
Idea we have of the formation of the
Bones, or Use; yet it's certain the
Antients made use of that Term to ex∣plain
most of the Actions of the Bo∣dy;
for when they were to declare
how the Chyle, or Blood was made,
or how the Bones or Cartilages were
form'd, nay, how the Senses acted;
they answer'd, That the Stomach had
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
a Chylific Faculty, the Liver a San∣guifying;
the Bones were form'd by
an Ossific, and the Cartilages by a
Cartilaginous Faculty, that the Eye
saw by the Visive Faculty; <HI>&amp;c sic de
caeteris.</HI></P>
<P>This was a general Answer, by
which they eluded (as well by their
occult Qualities) all Difficulties pro∣posed
to them, so that their Pupils
were as Ignorant at the finishing of
their Studies▪ as at the beginning;
but we at this Day explain all these
Actions purely Mechanically; as I
shall shew in demonstrating each
part of the Osteology exactly, that
the Action which it performs, abso∣lutely
depends on its Structure, so
that it can do nought else, but what it
does.</P>
<P>But to return from whence I have
digress'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Modern Definition.</NOTE> the Moderns say a Bone is
a similer part, most dry, cold and
hard, without sense, (unless by some
Preternatural Accident) inflexible,
affording Stabiliment, Figure and
Form to the whole Body.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
A Bone may be consider'd at two
distinct times, either before or after
the Birth.</P>
<P>In their beginning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature and Substance.</NOTE> or before the
Birth, they are of a Membranous Sub∣stance,
wrapt up, as it were, in very
many folds, or <HI>Laminae;</HI> which at
first are Gelatinous, in time grow
Cartilaginous, and at last when suffi∣ciently
indurated by the Ossific Li∣quor,
are so strong as to resist all in∣ward
force, and their Parts which
had before some Heterogeneous Bo∣dies
in their Insterstices, being squee∣zed
closer by the power and pressure
of the Spirits, dis-engage themselves
from those Bodies which lye between
their <HI>Laminae,</HI> so grow more solid,
wholly fixt, and void of motion,
which is about the time when the
Bones have attain'd their full perfe∣ction
of growth, which also puts a
period to the bulk and magnitude of
the Body, so that they are no more
extended or enlarged, either in
breadth or length.</P>
<P>The Bones are composed of many
strings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Composition of stringy Fibrils.</NOTE> or threads, which have their
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
course according to the length of the
Bones, or their Figure; for if the
Bone be of an unequal, or irregular
Figure, the strings are also unequal,
and irregular; except in the <HI>Cranium,</HI>
where the threads begin at a point,
(sometimes two or more) for the
most part in the Centre, and termi∣nate
in the Circumference of the Bone,
as the Spokes in a Wheel; for which
reason it's more thick, and compact
there, than in the Circumference,
the thready Fibrils being more close
and united there, which is visible in
the <HI>Cranium</HI> of a <HI>Foetus;</HI> the Bones
have also some transverse Fibres, to
hold the long ones in; which may be
seen in the Bones of the <HI>Tarsus,</HI> as al∣so
in the Extremities of most of the
long Bones, where the Porosities are.</P>
<P>The Ossification begins not in the
same place of every Bone;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the Ossification begins.</NOTE> in the long
Bones it begins in the middle, and to∣wards
each end; but in Bones of
an irregular Figure in several places,
as may be seen in the <HI>Ossa Innominata</HI>
of a <HI>Foetus,</HI> where it begins at three
points or places at once, so that they
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
seem to be three distinct Bones united
just in the middle of the <HI>Acetabulum,</HI>
but in time, as the Ossification in∣creases,
they grow more strong, the
fibrous threads join, and so make but
one Bone; for if the Bones should
have been totally Ossified before the
Birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Bones are not totally Ossified be∣fore the Birth.</NOTE> how should the <HI>Foetus</HI> pass
through the <HI>Vagina</HI> of the Womb as
it doth? For it's without Dispute, that
both the Bones of the Head, and also
the Hips of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> give way some∣what
in time of Exclusion; for it's
observed that those Animals which
have long and small Heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> but big
Bodies, have the Bones of their Head
wholly Ossified before the Birth, but
their Ribs not, so careful is Nature in
this Affair.</P>
<P>In the Skull, and most broad thin
Bones, as the <HI>Sternon,</HI> the Ossificati∣on
begins at two, three, or more
points, commonly about the Centre;
Nature is also very cautious in Ossify∣ing
long Bones all at once; for if
their Extremities had been Ossified as
soon as their middle, the ligamentous
and tendorous threads would not en∣ter
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
so easily their ends, to join them
together, which they can do, being
not totally Ossified. The Ossification,
as I said afore of the <HI>Ossa Innominata,</HI>
begins at three points, that they may
have the greater solidity; but quite
contrary in the Bones of the <HI>Cranium,</HI>
for while the middle of most Bones of
the <HI>Cranium</HI> are fully Ossified, their
edges are only Membranous, that
they may give way somewhat in time
of Birth, which they would not, were
the <HI>Cranium</HI> compleatly Ossified.
These are the Reasons why Nature re∣tards
Ossification in some Bones, and
advances it in others.</P>
<P>The Bones before they be through∣ly
indurated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vessels.</NOTE> have many Blood-ves∣sels,
which are obliterated, as soon as
the Meduller Glands are large enough
to separate the Oily Particles from the
Arterial Blood, (which have a Proper∣ty
of keeping the Bones soft) then the
Ossific Liquor which is emitted from
the aforesaid Glands hardens them,
and so presses the Parts closer toge∣ther,
and hinders the Blood from pas∣sing
and repassing as usual, when
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
they were softer, their bony threads
gave way, and being then not prest
so close; which Vessels are also boni∣fied
by the Ossific Juice, having lost
their first use; yet some few remain,
which serve only the Meduller Glands,
for their Nourishment, the Pulsation
of Blood in them having strength e∣nough
to scatter the Fibrils of the
Bones in that Part, and so makes pas∣sages
for themselves.</P>
<P>The Bones are nourished two ways,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nourish∣ment two fold.</NOTE>
the one in their beginning, that is,
when they are only Membranous, and
is quite different from the Nourish∣ment
they receive after their Perfecti∣on;
for now they are nourished as all
other Membranes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">When Mem∣branous.</NOTE> with Blood imme∣diately
from the Arteries, so that if
you then cut them, you'll find every
thread bloody, which is not so when
truly Ossified; for when the Bones
have occasion of greater solidity, Na∣ture
then changes her way of Nou∣rishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">When Bony.</NOTE>
which is by a peculiar Li∣quor
of a Saline Tartarous Nature,
prepared by the Meduller Glands, the
more oily Particles being separated,
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
and kept in them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Medulla Quid.</NOTE> which is that we
call the Marrow; this Liquor; I say,
insinuates its self all along the bony
strings, and is visible in a Fractured
Bone, it appearing at their Extremi∣ties,
and meeting together causes
them to reunite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Callus Quid.</NOTE> which we call <HI>Callus;</HI>
nay, we often find that the adjacent
Parts are sometimes indurated by this
Ossific Liquor, and the Limbs often
grow Gouty, and has not its former
nimble motion, the <HI>Callus</HI> growing too
big; for if they were bloody Particles,
which exuded forth of their bony
threads, instead of generating a <HI>Callus,</HI>
it would Impostumate, for all Blood
shed out of its Vessels putrifies, this
Liquor is of such an indurating Quali∣ty,
that if the Fibrils of the Bones be
any ways broken, that it sheds it self
in any great quantity, it will Ossifie
the very Tendons; I have seen the
Marrow it self turn'd bony.</P>
<P>The Bones have Nerves (is plain)
although no Sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nerves, but no Sense.</NOTE> for when they
come to the solid Substance of the
Bone, they are prest so close, that the
Animal Spirits cannot enter their Sub∣stance,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
and so consequently can have
no feeling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acids soften the Bones.</NOTE> unless softned by Acids,
which will cause them to have a dull
Sense, as may be try'd by the use of
Acids on the Teeth; which, as the a∣cidity
goes off, reassume their former
hardness, and insensibility. Some∣times
the Blood acquires such an aci∣dity
which is apt to cause a <HI>Spina Ven∣tosa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of a <HI>Spina Ven∣tosa.</HI></NOTE>
which is nothing else but a Ca∣riosity
of the Bones, proceeding from
an Acid Blood coming to the Meduller
Glands for the Nourishment of the
Bones; also Acid Acrid Humours in
an Ulcer may cause a Cariosity.</P>
<P>The Differences observed in the
Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences Nine.</NOTE> may be derived from Nine
Things, <HI>viz.</HI> from their Substance,
Quantity, Figure, Situation, Uses,
Motion, Sensibility, Generation, and
Cavities.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> The First Difference is derived
from their Substance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Substance.</NOTE> for some Bones
have a very hard one, as the <HI>Tibia;</HI>
others less hard, as the <HI>Vertebrae;</HI> and
finally, others have a more soft and
spongy one, as the <HI>Sternon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11"/>
The Second is derived from their <MILESTONE N="2"/>
Quantity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Quantity.</NOTE> for some as
those of the Thigh, Leg, Arm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
others less, as those of the Head;
some least of all, as those of the Fin∣gers.</P>
<P>The Third proceeds from their Fi∣gure; <MILESTONE N="3"/>
some are long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Figure.</NOTE> as the <HI>Os Femo∣ris,
Tibia, &amp;c.</HI> others short, as those
of the Fingers, and <HI>Metatarsus, &amp;c.</HI>
some round, as the <HI>Rotula;</HI> others
flat, as the <HI>Ossa Palati;</HI> others square,
as the <HI>Ossa Parietaria;</HI> others trian∣gular,
as the first Bone of the <HI>Sternon,
Scapula, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Fourth is from their Situation,<MILESTONE N="4"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Situation.</NOTE>
as some are plac'd in the Head, others
in the Trunk, and some in the Extre∣mities;
others are seated deeply, as
the Officles in the Cavity of the
Ear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Fifth is from their Use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Vse.</NOTE> as some <MILESTONE N="5"/>
serve to sustain the Body, as those of
Legs and Thighs, others to contain
and defend the Parts, as the Ribs de∣fend
the Lungs, Heart, <HI>&amp;c. Ossa Inno∣minata,</HI>
and <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> the Bladder,
Womb in Women, <HI>&amp;c. Cranium</HI> the
Brain.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12"/>
<MILESTONE N="6"/> The Sixth is known by their Moti∣on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Motion.</NOTE>
for some have a more manifest
motion, as the great Bones of the Ex∣tremities;
others have a less, as those
of <HI>Tarsus</HI> and <HI>Carpus;</HI> others none
at all, as those of the Head.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/> The Seventh is from their Sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Sense.</NOTE>
which is easily remarkt, for all the
Bones, generally speaking, have no
Sense, except the Teeth, and they
only a very dull Sense; except, as I
have already observed, they be soft∣ned
by some offending Acid.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="8"/> The Eighth is taken from the time
of their perfect Generation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the time of their Gene∣ration.</NOTE> and Per∣fection;
for some Bones are perfect in
the Womb, or before the Birth, as
the small Officles of the Ears; and o∣thers,
which do not acquire their Per∣fection,
but as the Subject advances
in Age, as all the rest of the Bones of
the Body, yet some of these Ossifie
quicker, as those of the lower Jaw;
others slower, as the <HI>Fontanella</HI> of the
Head.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9"/> The Ninth and last Difference is
drawn from their Cavities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their Cavities.</NOTE> for some
have great ones, and contain Marrow,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
as the Bones of the Extremities; and
there be others which have no mani∣fest
Cavity, but only Porosities;
which contain a Meduller Juice, as
those of <HI>Tarsus, Carpus, &amp;c.</HI> some
have holes, by which Vessels pass and
repass, as those in the <HI>Basis</HI> of the
<HI>Cranium</HI> and <HI>Vertebrae;</HI> others have
only Trenches or Furrows, as those of
the <HI>Sternon,</HI> Ribs; others have Si∣nesses,
as the <HI>Os Frontis,</HI> and <HI>Ossa Pe∣trosa;</HI>
lastly, some are pierced like
the holes in a Seive, as the <HI>Os Cibri∣forme.</HI></P>
<P>The things to be consider'd in the
Doctrine of each Bone are three;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Threetian's consider'd in the Bones.</NOTE>
1. The Apophisis. 2. Epiphisis. And
3. Cavities, Furrows, and Sinusses.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apophysis, of Process.</NOTE> The Bones not being of one <MILESTONE N="1"/>
even Form, or Figure, have at their
Extremities several Prominencies, or
Protuberancies, which are of two
sorts, the one is a continued part of
the Bone jetting manifestly out, above
its superficies, ordain'd for the more
commodious and strong insertion of
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
the Tendons of the Muscles, and is
call'd an Apophysis, or Process.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> The Second is an additional Bone
growing to another by immediate
contiguity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epiphysis, or Apendage.</NOTE> as if Nature had forgot
to make the Bone long enough, and is
generally more porous than the Bone
it self; which will separate if you
boil in Oil, for they will not separate
if boil'd in Water never so long, un∣less
the Subject be very young, it's
call'd an Apendage, or Epiphisis;
this in young Bodies may sometimes
by great force be separated from the
rest of the Bone, or to speak impro∣perly,
Dislocated.</P>
<P>If this Protuberance be round, it's
call'd <HI>Caput,</HI> under which is the <HI>Cer∣vix,</HI>
as in the superior part of the <HI>Os
Femoris;</HI> if it be flat, <HI>Cordilus;</HI> if
sharp, <HI>Corone;</HI> others from their fi∣gure
are call'd Styloides, Mostoides,
Coracoides, Ancyroides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Embrions have not these Protube∣rances
so large; for except some very
few large ones, they are hardly vi∣sible.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
These Protuberances are either Na∣tural,
as the <HI>Spina</HI> of the <HI>Scapula;</HI> the
rest are only Accidental.</P>
<P>The Accidental Protuberances of
the Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the Protuberan∣ces.</NOTE> (which are only manifest
when the Bones are perfect) are cau∣sed
by the Tendons of the Muscles or
Ligaments, which always are inser∣ted
there; for the stringy Filaments
of the Tendons and Ligaments, en∣tring
into the Bones (while soft)
between their stringy threads, cause
them to inlarge there into a bulk,
which it must do of necessity, there
being a double portion of Fibres uni∣ted
together; which are all Ossified
as the bony Liquor increases.</P>
<P>It's a general Note, that where you
find such Protuberances, some Liga∣ments
or Tendons of Muscles are in∣serted
there; although these Protube∣rances
seem only to be accidental,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vses of the Protuberan∣ces.</NOTE> yet
they have many uses; first, by them
the Muscles have a greater force to
lift or pull up the Part. Secondly,
they are of use to inlarge the Extremi∣ties
of the Bones, that the Body be
sustain'd.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<MILESTONE N="3"/> The next part of the Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cavities of three sorts.</NOTE> that
come under our Consideration, are
the Cavities, which are either Exter∣nal
or Internal: These Cavities are of
three sorts, Holes, or <HI>Foramina;</HI>
Trenches, or Furrows, and Sinusses.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> A <HI>Foramina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina, or holes.</NOTE> or Hole, is a Cavity
which is perforated in a Bone, or
made up of two Bones join'd together,
as may be seen in the <HI>Basis</HI> of the <HI>Cra∣nium,</HI>
lower Jaw, <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the
Ribs. They are design'd for the pas∣sage
of the Vessels and Nerves, which
pass through them, also the great
Cavity of the <HI>Ischium</HI> may be call'd
a Hole.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/><HI>A Trench,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trenches, or Furrows.</NOTE> or Furrow, is not a Ca∣vity
through the Bone, but only a
deep hole, or hollowness, long, or
round, as the orbit of the Eye, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
sometimes very shallow, as those in
the inside of the <HI>Cranium, &amp;c.</HI> some
of a mean between both, as those in
the Joints, to receive the Protube.
rances of other Bones; some call these
Sinusses, but improperly.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/> A <HI>Sinus</HI> is a sort of Cavity in a Bone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinusses.</NOTE>
whereof the Orifice or Entrance is ve∣ry
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
strait, and the bottom large, such
are in the Frontal Bone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I shall declare the use of all these
Cavities, when I Treat of each Bone
in particular.</P>
<P>All the long Bones of the Body are
hollow in the inside towards the mid∣dle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All long Bones hol∣low.</NOTE>
and contain a Marrow, which is
only a heap of Membranous Vesicule,
full of a fatty or oily Substance, call'd
Meduller Glands; which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meduller Glands.</NOTE> as I obser∣ved
before, separated the more oily
Particles from the Blood, so that the
more salfish only remain'd, which has
the Ossific Virtue of rendering the
Bones hard: The Ends or Extremities
are porous, somewhat like a Pumice
Stone, containing a Meduller Juice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meduller Juice.</NOTE>
like thin Oil, and have very few
Glands; it's probable that the Liga∣mentous
strings entring the top of the
Bones, divide and scatter the bony
threads, which make it so porous.</P>
<P>The External Superficies of all
Bones have a certain solid <HI>Cortex.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solid Cor∣tex in all Bones.</NOTE></P>
<P>All the External Cavities which
serve for Articulation, have at their
Circumference an Eminence call'd a
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
Lip, to which is fastned a Circular
Ligament, which embracing the Head
of the received Bone, fortifies the Ar∣ticulation.</P>
<P>As for each particular Process and
Cavity, we shall describe them in
the Demonstrations of each particular
Bone.</P>
<P>Before I mention the Articulation
of the Bones, I think it convenient to
observe these things.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bones not of the same big∣ness in Wo∣men as in Men.</NOTE> All the Bones are not of the
same greatness, and that not only in
Persons of different Stature, but also
in those of an equal Height, or Sta∣ture;
for some of these have their
Bones smaller than others, and it's
Beauty consists (as some have said it
does) in the delicateness and small∣ness
of the Bones, then Women have
all the Reason imaginable to have a
better Shape and Symetry than Men,
by reason their Bones are smaller; the
Bones also of their Face are finer and
more smooth.</P>
<P>There's also a great difference be∣tween
the Bones of the <HI>Ossa Innomina∣ta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference of the Ossa in∣nominata.</NOTE>
<PB N="19" REF="15"/>
which makes the <HI>Pelvis.</HI> In Men
they are less and more unequal, but
in Women larger, and smoother, to
have a greater space to contain the
Womb; also a Woman's <HI>Os Sacrum</HI>
inclines more backwards than a Man's
which makes their Buttocks more
large.</P>
<P>We must also observe a difference in
the Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference of the Bones according to Age.</NOTE> according as we grow in
Years; for from the Birth to the twen∣tieth
Year, or thereabouts, the Bones
continually increase, and from that to
the sixtieth they continue in the same
stay, neither increasing or diminish∣ing;
but after that they daily dimi∣nish,
by reason of the bony Fibres dry∣ing,
approach nearer one another,
and so must consequently have a less
bulk.</P>
<P>The Colour of the Bones is not a∣like
in all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference from the Colour.</NOTE> for some have them very
white, others less, but some almost
greyish; so that if you take the same
Pains in whitening two or three Ske∣letons,
yet one will be doubtless whi∣ter
than the other.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="16"/>
It's true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Periostion.</NOTE> as I have observed before,
that the Bones have no sense; yet
they are Invested with a very sensible
Membrane, call'd <HI>Periostion,</HI> as if
we should say a Membrane over or
inversing the Bone, it's very thin;
all Bones have this, except the Teeth.
I think there's a great Question about
its Use.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse.</NOTE> Some affirm it's to convey
bloody Vessels to the Bones; but its
rather believed to be for the greater
implantation of the Tendons of the
Muscles; for when you separate the
<HI>Periostion,</HI> the Muscle comes off with
it.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to the manner
of the Articulation of the Bones;
there's such Art in the Conjunctions
of the Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articulati∣on of the Bones.</NOTE> that they have served as
a pattern to many Artizans in their
Curious Works; for they could find
nothing in Nature more fit to copy by;
and although there be so many vari∣ous
ways of Articulation, as almost
Junctures, yet they are all necessary,
otherwise Man could never move him∣self
every way so compleatly as he
does.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="16"/>
The Bones join'd together have ei∣ther
motion, or none, the former is
call'd Articulation, the latter <HI>Symphy∣sis,</HI>
Or growing together.</P>
<P>Articulation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articulation twofold.</NOTE> is either for manifest,
or obscure motion: The first is call'd
<HI>Diarthrosis,</HI> or loose Articulation, the
other <HI>Synarthrosis,</HI> or more close and
compact.</P>
<P>Diarthrosis <HI>is Threefold, 1. Enar∣throsis.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Diar∣throsis <HI>threefold.</HI></NOTE>
2. <HI>Anthrodiae. 3. Gyngli∣mus.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Enarthrosis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enarthro∣sis.</NOTE> is when a large
Head is received into a deep Cavity,
as the <HI>Os Femoris</HI> in the <HI>Acetabulum</HI>
of the <HI>Ossa Innominata.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Arthrodia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arthrodia.</NOTE> is when the Cavity
is shallow, and the Head of the re∣ceived
Bone also shallow and flattish,
as the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> with the <HI>Scapula,</HI>
and the Bones of the <HI>Metacarp</HI> and
<HI>Metatarse;</HI> with the first <HI>Phalanx</HI> of
the Fingers and Toes.</P>
<P>Now the Bones which are Articu∣lated
by <HI>Enarthrosis,</HI> and <HI>Arthrodia,</HI>
are capable of all sorts of motion, as
upwards, downwards, forwards,
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
backwards, and circularly; yet the
deeper the Cavity, and the more bony
the Edges are, the motion is render'd
more slow, and not so brisk and nim∣ble
as when the Cup is not so deep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">These two all sorts of motion.</NOTE>
this is seen in the <HI>Os Femoris,</HI> and <HI>Ace∣tabulum,</HI>
for the <HI>Os Humeri</HI> being in∣serted
in a more shallow Cup, is ca∣pable
of all sorts of motion, and that
to a great degree, yet about the Cup
or the <HI>Scapula</HI> there are several Carti∣lages,
which make it seem as deep as
the <HI>Acetabulum,</HI> but at the same time
by giving way, hinders not the very
free motion of the <HI>Humerus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ginglimus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ginglimus <HI>threefold.</HI></NOTE> is when the same Bone
both receives, and is received, and is
Threefold. 1. <HI>Ginglimus Proximus.</HI>
2. <HI>Longus. 3. Compositus.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Ginglimus Proximus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proximus.</NOTE> is when a
Bone is received by another, and re∣ceives
the same, as the lower part of
the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> and <HI>Ʋlna.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Ginglimus Longus,</HI> is when two
Bones are join'd together according to
their length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Longus.</NOTE> so that the one Bone ha∣ving
a Cavity in its side towards the
<PB N="23" REF="17"/>
end, receives the head of the other,
which has a Cavity likewise at its o∣ther
Extremity, to receive a Protube∣rance
of the first Bone, as the <HI>Radius</HI>
and <HI>Ulna.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Ginglimus Compositus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Composi∣tus.</NOTE> is when a
Bone receives one, and is received by
another, as in some of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of
the Back, where one receives the up∣per,
and is received by the lower:
<HI>Ginglimus Compositus,</HI> is also when a
long Process of a Bone is inserted into
another above it, and so turns in the
Cavity as an <HI>Axis</HI> in a Wheel, as the
second <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck with the
first.</P>
<P>As <HI>Enarthrosis,</HI> and <HI>Arthrodia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ginglimus <HI>for Flexion and Exten∣sion ouly.</HI></NOTE> serve
for all sorts of motion, <HI>Ginglimus</HI>
serves only for Flexion, and Extensi∣on;
yet in the <HI>Radius</HI> and <HI>Vlna</HI> it
serves for Pronation and Supination.</P>
<P>When a Bone is join'd by double
<HI>Arthrodia,</HI> it makes a sort of <HI>Gingli∣mus,</HI>
as may be seen in the lower
Jaw.</P>
<P><HI>Synarthrosis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Synarthro∣sis.</NOTE> or obscure motion, is
in the Ribs which have a little motion
in their ends towards the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> in
<PB N="24" REF="18"/>
Respiration; also most of the Bones of
the <HI>Tarsus</HI> and <HI>Carpus,</HI> which in great
pressure give way a little, for the
more easie motion of the Part.</P>
<P><HI>Symphysis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Symphy∣sis <HI>Three∣fold.</HI></NOTE> is only when the Bones
are united without any motion at all,
and is Threefold, as <HI>Sutura, Harmonia,</HI>
and <HI>Gomphosis.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>Sutura,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sutura.</NOTE> is when the Bones are
united together in their edges by little
Points, or Teeth (as it were) un∣equally,
as may be seen in the Bones
of the <HI>Cranium.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Harmonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Harmonia.</NOTE> is an union of the
Bones by a simple Line only, either
streight or curved, as the Bones of the
Nose, Face, Palate; but this is only
in their outward part, for we always
find them Internally Serratil, or Su∣ture
like.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Gomphosis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gompho∣sis.</NOTE> is when one Bone is
fastned in another, as a Nail in Wood,
so are the Teeth in the Jaws.</P>
<P>Some add to the <HI>symphysis</HI> several
other sorts of Articulations, as <HI>Syn∣chondrosis, Syssarcosis, syneurosis, vel
Syntenosis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="18"/>
<HI>Synchondrosis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Synchon∣drosis.</NOTE> is when a Cartilagi∣nous
Substance interveens, as may be
seen in the middle of the lower Jaw;
which in young are two distinct
Bones, but as the Ossific Liquor pre∣dominates,
grow one; also the <HI>Ossa
Pubis</HI> are united by it, so are the Bo∣dies
of the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> one to another.</P>
<P><HI>Syssarcosis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Syssarcosis.</NOTE> is when a Bone is fastned
by Means of Flesh only, as the <HI>Os Hy∣oides</HI>
in the Mouth, and the <HI>Scapula</HI> to
the Ribs.</P>
<P><HI>Syneurosis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Syneurosis.</NOTE> <HI>vel Syntenosis,</HI> is when
Bones are united together by means
of Ligamentous Parts, as the <HI>Rotula</HI>
with the Bones of the Legs; but I
think these are not properly Articula∣tions.</P>
<P>The Bones of the Body in an Adult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number 245.</NOTE>
are accounted 245. For Example, the
Head has 64, the Trunk 57, the Arms
and Hands 64, the Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 60,
which makes in all 243. Some per∣haps
may wonder why the Great Crea∣tor
composed such a number of Bones;
I Answer, how could the Hand or
Arm perform all the Actions it does,
and put it self in so many Thousand
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>
Postures, had it not many Junctures
and Articulations? For had the Part
been compos'd but of one or two
Bones, how Lame and Preposterously
would it have acted? The same may
be said of the Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if the
<HI>Spine</HI> had not been made up of such a
number of <HI>Vertebrae,</HI> how could we
have bent, or mov'd it as we do? It
was therefore convenient and necessa∣ry
for the Perfection of Man and his
Functions, to have as many Bones as
he has.</P>
<P>The Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Head 64.</NOTE> as I said, is made up of
64 Bones, which are thus number'd,
6 proper of the Skull, 8 of the Ears,
4 in each, 3 Common of the Skull;
Face 11, with the <HI>Vomer; Os Hyoid</HI> 1,
lower Jaw 1, though some make it 2,
Teeth about 32, which make 62;
but if you add the <HI>Ossa Spongiosa,</HI> they
make 64.</P>
<P>The Trunk consists of 57 Bones;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trunk 57.</NOTE>
<HI>Vertebrae</HI> 25, as 7 of the Neck, 12 of

the Bones in particular;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skeleton di∣vided into three parts.</NOTE> we di∣vide
the Skeleton into three parts, as
the Head, Trunk and Limbs.</P>
<P>By the Head we understand not on∣ly
all the Bones of the Skull, but also
those of the Face, even from the <HI>Ver∣tix</HI>
to the first <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck;
by the Trunk all that composes the
Neck, Back, Loins, <HI>Os Sacrum, Ossa
Innominata, Sternon, &amp;c.</HI> By the
Limbs those which make up the Arms
and Legs, generally so called; of all
which in order. The Head is subdi∣vided
into the Skull, properly so cal∣led,
and the Face.</P>
<P>The Skull (I mean that upper part
whose Bones compose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figure of the Skull.</NOTE> and make up
a large Cavity, which contains the
Brain, in which you must consider its
Figure altogether) is globous, some∣what
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>
what long, but flattish towards the
sides, for the better Situation of the
Temporal Muscles; which being on,
make it look more round.</P>
<P>All the Bones of the Skull are made
up of two <HI>Laminae</HI> or Plates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skull, two Tables.</NOTE> call'd
Tables, one Internal, the other Ex∣ternal,
between which lyes a Medul∣lar
Juice, of a reddish Colour, call'd
the Pith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploe, what.</NOTE> or Diploe, which is very
discernable in young Persons; but as
we grow in Years, the Ossific Liquor
invading, it bonifies.</P>
<P>The Exterior and Superior Superfi∣cies
of the <HI>Cranium;</HI> is very smooth,
and polished, having few inequalities;
but where the Sutures are, the Inter∣nal
Superior Superficies is not so equal,
having many little <HI>Sulci,</HI> or Furrows,
which are caused by the Vessels of the
<HI>Dura Mater,</HI> when the Skull is but
Membranous, being then capable of
receiving any Impression, that the
Pulsation of the Vessels give it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the Furrows.</NOTE> so
make themselves Furrows; but its
Internal Inferior Part is very unequal,
by reason of the many Productions
and Cavities found there.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="24"/>
The <HI>Cranium</HI> has many <HI>Foramina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina <HI>in General.</HI></NOTE>
which give way or passage to the Ves∣sels
sels passing and repassing, which fill
up these holes so close, that no Fumes
or Vapours, as the Antients believed,
can get in, or come forth, unless by
the Vessels themselves: we will shew
all these holes, at the latter end of this
Demonstration.</P>
<P>It's a Question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bigness of the <HI>Cra∣nium,</HI> de∣pends on the Brain.</NOTE> whether it be the
<HI>Cranium,</HI> which gives greatness to the
Brain; or whether the Brain gives
form to the <HI>Cranium,</HI> I Answer, that
the bigness of the <HI>Cranium</HI> depends on
that of the Brain, for two Reasons;
First, the <HI>Cranium,</HI> while Membra∣nous,
especially towards the Sutures,
extends it self more or less, as the Brain
increases: The Second, is that the
<HI>Cranium</HI> is not totally Ossified till the
Brain is arrived to its full Magnitude;
for we see in an Infant new-born,
that although the Brain be perfect,
yet at the same time, the <HI>Cranium</HI> is
only Cartilaginous about the Sutures;
though bony in the middle of every
Bone, nay, the <HI>Fontanella</HI> does not Os∣sifie
under some Years; from whence
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>
also it is, that in Labour these Bones,
as I have before observed, give way,
and fold over one another, for the
more easie <HI>exit</HI> of the Infant out of the
Womb.</P>
<P>The Bones of the <HI>Cranium</HI> are join'd
together by Sutures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sutures, twofold.</NOTE> which are of two
sorts, true, or false; or to speak more
properly, common, or proper.</P>
<P>The Proper are Eight.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proper, three.</NOTE></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> 1. <HI>Coronalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coronalis.</NOTE> (<HI>vel Frontalis</HI>) because
the Antients used to wear their Gar∣lands
on that part of the Head, it
reaches from one Temporal Bone to
the other, joining the <HI>Os Frontis</HI> to
the <HI>Ossa Parietaria.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> 2. <HI>Lambdoides</HI> being like the Greek
Letter <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambdoi∣des.</NOTE> others call it <HI>Triangularis;</HI>
this Suture is seldom wanting, what∣ever
the rest are; it begins at the <HI>Basis</HI>
of the <HI>Os Occipitis,</HI> and ascends ob∣liquely
to the middle of the back-part
of the Head, and descends again to
the other side of the Head; the Point
in the middle is call'd <HI>Vertix,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vertix, <HI>what.</HI></NOTE> by rea∣son
the Hair on the Scalp commonly
turns there; it joins the Occipital Bone
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>
to the Bones of the Temples, and <HI>Ossa
Parietaria.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Sagittalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sagittalis.</NOTE> because it runs length∣ways <MILESTONE N="3"/>
as an Arrow; it begins at the
<HI>Vertix</HI> of the <HI>Sutura Lambdoides,</HI> and
marching strait forwards to the mid∣dle
of the Coronal Suture; in Chil∣dren
it divides the Coronal Bone, and
goes quite to the Nose, which as we
grow in Years vanishes; yet I have
seen it in the <HI>Cranium</HI> of some A∣dults.</P>
<P>The Sutures being so united toge∣ther,
make up a Figure almost like
this )—&lt;.</P>
<P>Some of our Modern Anatomical
Professors, will have the Sutures to
be Serratil only in the Superior Ta∣ble,
but join'd by Harmony in the
Lower, but it's always found to the
contrary.</P>
<P>The Common are Five,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common, five.</NOTE> or more;
these are the Chief, 1. The Suture
<HI>Squamose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Squamosae.</NOTE> or Scale-like, because ap∣ply'd
as one Scale on another; they
are two, one on each side, which a∣rise
from the outside of the Mastoid∣process,
and circumscribing the Tem∣ple-bones,
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>
descend Circularly to∣wards
the <HI>Basis</HI> of the Ears.</P>
<P>Whatever Anatomists say, I think
them true Sutures, being Serratil as
well Internally, as Externally.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Orbalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orbalis.</NOTE> it begins at the top of
the <HI>Sutura Squamosa,</HI> and descending
obliquely towards the Orbit of the
Eye, crosses on the top of the Nose,
so passes over the other Eye, and
so on to the other Squamous Suture.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Nasalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nasalis.</NOTE> which divides the Bones
of the Nose.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Sutura Basilaris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basilaris.</NOTE> which separates
the other Bones from the <HI>Os Basilare.</HI></P>
<P>5. <HI>Sutura Ethmoides,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ethmoides</NOTE> <HI>seu Cribrifor∣mis,</HI>
dividing this Bone from the <HI>Os
Frontis;</HI> some say that these Four last
are rather <HI>Harmonia,</HI> than <HI>Sutura,</HI> but
Demonstration shews the contrary.</P>
<P>The Sutures have many uses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse of the Sutures.</NOTE> the
principal are these; 1. Many Liga∣mentous
Fibres pass through them
from the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> to the <HI>Pericrani∣um,</HI>
which suspends the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI>
so are a sort of hinderance of too vio∣lent
Concussions of the Brain, in any
great motions of the Body; for by
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>
these Fibres the Brain is kept more
light; it's by this Communication,
that when the <HI>Pericranium</HI> is wound∣ed,
an Inflammation often arises in
the <HI>Dura, Mater,</HI> as if it had received
some offence it self: These Fibres also,
by suspending the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> and
keeping it close to the Interior Surface
of the <HI>Cranium,</HI> the Arteries in the
Cortical part have a freer motion,
which would be somewhat impeded,
if it fell on the Brain. 2. They give
passage to several Vessels, that are pas∣sing
and repassing to the Diploe, for the
Nourishment of the Bones of the <HI>Cra∣nium.</HI>
3. They are of use in hinder∣ing
Fractures from passing further
than one Bone, for they always stop
at the Sutures, which if the Skull were
but one continued Bone, the Fracture
would be apt to run over all the <HI>Cra∣nium,</HI>
as may be seen daily in any
Earthen or Glass Vessel, when crackt
by a stroke, it commonly runs almost
quite over, or round. Some say, a
fourth Use is, to give a vent or breath∣ing
to many Fuliginous Vapours ga∣ther'd
within the <HI>Cranium,</HI> but I much
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>
question this use; yet some say, that
many who have had their Sutures too
close, have been subject to insuppor∣table
Head-aches, Transpiration ha∣ving
been stopt, as they say; but I
rather think it proceeded from the
pressure of the Vessels which pass
through them, which causing an Ob∣struction
of the flowing Liquors, was
a cause of these Pains.</P>
<P>There are many Observations in se∣veral
Authentick and Learned Au∣thors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some have had no Su∣tures.</NOTE>
of some who have had none,
or very few Sutures, and others who
have had more than usual. I saw a
Skull lately in the Hands of an Ingeni∣ous
Chirurgeon, my very good
Friend, which had a Suture running
transverse the Occipital Bone, and the
Sagittal pass'd quite through the <HI>Os
Frontis,</HI> and it was the Skull of an A∣dult;
such is the various Disports of
Nature; also in very Old Age the Su∣tures
are almost obliterated, the Ossi∣fic
Liquor then predominating.</P>
<P>Embryons have no Sutures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Sutures are made.</NOTE> or at
least not to be well distinguished, their
Skulls being wholly Membranous; so
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>
while the Ossific Liquor, (which as I
have said, begins at a point, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
the <HI>Cranium</HI>) insinuates it self along
the bony Threads, and by degrees har∣dens
them, some Fibrous and Vascu∣lar
Strings passing from the <HI>Dura Ma∣ter</HI>
to the <HI>Pericranium,</HI> hinders in
those places the bony Liquor from u∣niting,
so forms these Seams or Su∣tures;
for in a <HI>Foetus</HI> the Skull being
as yet Membranous in its edges, wrap,
or fold themselves as it were one over
another, to take up less room in the
Birth; for had the Skull been totally
Ossified before the Birth, the Infant
would for the most part endanger the
Life of the Mother; this may be daily
seen in young Children, where the
Skull is wholly Membranous in the
top of the Head between the Coronal
and Sagittal Sutures, which place is
call'd <HI>Fontanella.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fontanel∣la, <HI>what.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The Bones of the Skull are either
Proper or Common; the Proper are
Six in number.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Os Frontis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proper Bones of the Skull, Six.</NOTE> or <HI>Coronalis,</HI> the
Forechead-Bone; of a Semicircular Fi∣gure,
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>
in its superior part, situated in
the Superior part of the Face, and An∣terior
of the <HI>Cranium,</HI> bounded above
by the Coronal Suture from the <HI>Ossa
Parietaria,</HI> on the sides by the <HI>Ossa
Temporum,</HI> below by the <HI>Transver∣salis,</HI>
or <HI>Orbalis</HI> from the Nose,
Eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The things to be consider'd in this
Bone, are its Cavities and Processes.</P>
<P>Its outside is smooth, as are most of
the Bones of the <HI>Cranium,</HI> no Tendons
or Ligaments being inserted here.</P>
<P>The Ossification begins in this Bone
at two Points, between the <HI>Laminae</HI> of
this Bone there's a Cavity call'd <HI>Sinus
Frontalis;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Os Fron∣tis.</NOTE> it's oft-times double, which
by two small <HI>Foramina</HI> enter into the
Nostrils; this <HI>Sinus</HI> makes the inside
of this Bone arise in a ridge, which be∣gins
about the top of the Forehead,
where the Hair grows not, and reaches
to the <HI>Crista Galli;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> for which reason
we must not Trepan here, lest we of∣fend
the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> on each side the
ridge, whenas the middle is not per∣forated
by much; the upper <HI>Lamina</HI>
of this coming to the Eyes, where
<PB N="39" REF="28"/>
turning inwards, makes up part of the
Orbit on the upper side: This: <HI>Sinus</HI> is
lined with a thick Membrane full of
Glands, which separate a <HI>Mucus</HI> to
moisten the Nose; in Brutes it's very
large, but not so in Men; yet once I
saw a Skull which had it extreamly
large, and divided in four or five
Cells, quite round the <HI>Basis</HI> of the
<HI>Os Frontis,</HI> so that the Internal Protu∣berances
almost hid the <HI>Crista Galli;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE>
yet sometimes this <HI>Sinus</HI> is quite obli∣terated,
and the Membrane turn'd
bony, as the Ossific Liquor increases,
and we incline in Age.</P>
<P>In its lower part over each Eye is a
small <HI>Foramen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramine.</NOTE> through which passes
a Branch of the five pair of Nerves to
the Musculous Flesh on the Forehead.</P>
<P>It has Four Processes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Processes.</NOTE> the two grea∣ter
at the Internal <HI>Canthus</HI> of the Eyes,
the other two at the less; its inner
<HI>Lamen</HI> about the Eye-brows towards
the Nose, bunches inwards, so causes a
hollowness there, which is part of the
<HI>Sinus Frontalis.</HI></P>
<P>2. The <HI>Os Occipitis</HI> is opposite to
the Coronal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Os Occi∣pitis.</NOTE> in the hinder part of the
<PB N="40" REF="29"/>
Head, it's the thickest and strongest
Bone of the Head; the reason whereof
is this, we having no Eyes behind,
Nature has framed it of a thicker con∣sistence,
to the end it may the better
resist any stroak or blow it receives;
it's five-corner'd, join'd to the <HI>Ossa
Parietaria</HI> by the Lambdoid Suture,
and to the <HI>Ossa Temporum</HI> by the
Squamous Sutures, and it's bottom to
the <HI>Os Sphenoides,</HI> by a sort of Har∣mony.</P>
<P>The things to be consider'd in this
Bone, are its Sinusses, <HI>Foramina,</HI> and
Processes.</P>
<P>Its Sinusses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinusses, or <HI>Sulci.</HI></NOTE> or rather <HI>Sulci,</HI> are
many, two on the External part just
behind the <HI>Foramen Medullare;</HI> and
seven in the Internal Superficies, the

of the <HI>Carebel,</HI> the other
are of small moment.</P>
<P>It has five <HI>Foramina</HI> or Holes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina.</NOTE> the
lowest and largest call'd <HI>Foramen Me∣dullare,</HI>
the Spinal Marrow passing by
this hole to all the <HI>Vertebrae;</HI> the other
four are less, and only serve for the
<HI>exit</HI> of the Vessels; two give passage
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>
to the Nerves of the Tongue, and two
to the <HI>Arteriae Cervicales;</HI> these are
proper <HI>Foramina,</HI> there are two others
which are common both to it and the
other Bones, one on each side the <HI>Os
Petrosum,</HI> which give passage to the
eighth pair of Nerves call'd <HI>parvagum,</HI>
and to the two Internal Jugular
Veins.</P>
<P>It has five Processes, four of which
are on the outside by the <HI>Foramen Me∣dullare;</HI>
the two innermost are call'd
<HI>Condyli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Processes.</NOTE> and are received by the two
shallow <HI>Sinus</HI>'s of the first <HI>Vertebra</HI> of
the Neck, serving for the Articulati∣on
of the Head; in its Internal part it
has a long Protuberance or Ridge,
which ascends in the middle from the
<HI>Foramen Medullare,</HI> and parts the Pro∣tuberances
of the <HI>Cerebellum,</HI> this is
its fifth Process.</P>
<P>There's another small Protuberance
or Process,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sixth Pro∣cess, not de∣scrib'd by a∣ny Author.</NOTE> which is not describ'd by
any Author; it lyes between the
<HI>Condyli,</HI> from it passes a Ligament,
which joins it to the first <HI>Vertebra</HI> of
the Neck.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="30"/>
It has also several small Prominen∣ces
towards its <HI>Basis</HI> on the outside,
some Tendons being inserted there.</P>
<P>Third and fourth are the <HI>Ossa Sinci∣pitis,

<P>The second Common Bone is call'd
<HI>Os Cribriforme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Cribri∣forme.</NOTE> being perforated like a

it's also join'd to the two Bones
of the upper Jaw, and behind to the

<P>On its inside it has an almost Trian∣gular
Process, call'd <HI>Crista Galli</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crista Gal∣li.</NOTE> the
Coxcomb; it arises just where the
Process of the <HI>Sinus Frontalis</HI> ends,
and reaches about half way in the
middle of the Bone; the <HI>Falx</HI> which

whereas the above-nam'd Creatures
have very many; so that it's not dif∣ficult
to judge of the acuteness of the
smell, from the multiplicity of these
folds; most Anatomists consider them
as parts of the <HI>Os Cribriforme,</HI> using the

I think them to be different Bones.</P>
<P>The third Common Bone is call'd
<HI>Os Jugale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Jugale.</NOTE> <HI>vel Zygoma,</HI> by some the

<HEAD>Demonstration III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bones of the Face.</HEAD>
<P>IF the structure of the Bones of the
<HI>Cranium</HI> be worthy our Admirati∣on,
the Composition of the Bones of
the Face, which now comes under our
view, is no less surprizing; for al∣though
that contains the Brain, which
is one of the most Noble Parts of the
Body; yet the Face where most of the
Senses are lodged, and for many Rea∣sons
may be call'd the Image of the
Soul, since most, if not all the Passions
of the Mind, are fully demonstrated
in the Face, cannot merit less, especi∣ally
in the wonderful structure of the
Bones which compose it. The Face
is also the Seat of Beauty, which
Charms and Attracts the Eyes of all
to behold it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bones give Figure, Form, and Beauty to the whole Body.</NOTE> and nothing contributes
more to this Beauty than a good For∣mation,
and true Symmetry of the
Bones: <HI>Ex. gratia,</HI> if the lower part
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>
of the Coronal Bone bunch out too
much, it makes them Beetle brow'd,
as we call it: If the Bones of the Nose
be too large, and rising from the Face,
it makes them Hawk-nosed: If the
lower Jaw be too sharp, or pointed,
it makes an Out mouth, and so of the
rest; yet we may say the same of the
Bones of the whole Body, they giv∣ing,
as I have said, Shape and Figure
to all; so that if they be any way de∣form'd
or unproportioned, that part
must of necessity be disfigured.</P>
<P>The Bones of the Face are divided
into those of the upper and lower
Jaw.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Division.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Bones of the superior Jaw are
eleven in number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bones of the upper Jaw, eleven.</NOTE> five on each side,
and an odd one.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ossa Triangulares</HI> are big,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1, 2, Ossa Trian∣gulares.</NOTE> of a
hard and solid Substance, in Figure
triangular, wherefore so call'd, plac'd
on the lower side of the outward <HI>Can∣thus</HI>
of the Eye's Orbit, the middle are
advanced out, and rising, which forms
the Balls of the Cheeks: One of their
Angular Processes, as I said before,
makes up the <HI>Os Jugale,</HI> being join'd
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>
with the long Process of the Temple-Bone;
they also make the inferior part
of the Orbit of the Eyes, and is united
to four Bones, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Coronalis,
Sphenoides, Maxillary,</HI> and <HI>Os Petro∣sum.</HI></P>
<P>They have three <HI>Apophises</HI> each;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apophisis, <HI>three.</HI></NOTE> one
of which makes an eminence, which
forms the lesser Angle of the Eye; the
other advancing towards the Nose,
makes the greatest part of the inferior
Lip of the Orbit; the third may well
be call'd <HI>Processus Jugalis,</HI> which I
have already mentioned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ossa Lachrimalia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3, 4, Ossa La∣chrimales.</NOTE> <HI>seu Ʋnguis,</HI>
are very little and thin, in shape of a
Nail of a Man's Hand, seated in the
great <HI>Canthus</HI> of the Eyes, within the
Orbit; there's a small <HI>Foramina,</HI> in
each call'd <HI>Lachrimale,</HI> in which the
Lachrimal Duct passes to the Nose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puncta La∣chrimalia.</NOTE>
also through this hole passes a Branch
of the fifth pair of Nerves, to the in∣ner
Membrane of the Nose.</P>
<P>These Bones are so small, that they
be easily lost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ossa Male</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5, 6, Ossa Maxil∣lares.</NOTE> some call them
<HI>Maxillares,</HI> are the thickest, greatest,
<PB N="54" REF="36"/>
and spongiest of all the Bones of the
Face, and makes up the greatest part
of the Cheeks and Palate.</P>
<P>Parts to be consider'd in these Bones,
are first, many deep Cavities which
are in their lower edge, call'd <HI>Alveoli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alveoli.</NOTE>
or Sockets, in which the Teeth are
fastned: Secondly, each has an Inter∣nal
<HI>Sinus,</HI> which is lin'd with the same
sort of Glandulous Membrane, as the
<HI>Sinus Frontalis,</HI> and of the same use,
and is call'd <HI>Sinus Maxillare.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinus Max∣illare.</NOTE> There's
also another long one, which runs a∣long
over the Roots of the Teeth, in
which the Vessels pass which serve for
the Nourishment of the Teeth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ossa Nasi</HI> are two long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7, 8, Ossa Nasi.</NOTE> hard,
and somewhat thick Bones, of a Pyra∣midal
Figure each, being join'd, they
make up the bony or superior part of
the Nose; their lower Extrmities are
somewhat unequal, for the more
strong Connexion of the Cartilages of
the Nose with it; they are join'd to∣gether
by <HI>Harmonia.</HI></P>
<P>The last pair are call'd <HI>Ossa Palati,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">9, 10, Ossa Palati.</NOTE>
are very broad, but thin, and being
join'd by <HI>Harmonia,</HI> make up the Roof
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>
of the Mouth; they are join'd to the
<HI>Ossa Maxillares</HI> forwardly, and back∣wardly,
sideways to the Pterygoid A∣pophisis,
by the Sphenoidal Suture:
Each Bone has a hole forwardly, call'd
<HI>Foramen Gustativum.</HI></P>
<P>The eleventh Bone of the upper
Jaw is call'd <HI>Vomer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">11, Os Vomer.</NOTE> by reason the An∣tients
say it resembes a Plough-share;
it's situated in the middle over the
Palate, edgeways, and is, as it were, a
sort of <HI>Septum,</HI> dividing the interior
part of the Nostrils.</P>
<P>Before I pass to the lower Jaw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orbita Oc∣culorum.</NOTE>
'twill not be amiss to give a Descripti∣on
of the Orbits of the Eyes; they are
two great Cavities plac'd at the infe∣rior
part of the <HI>Os Frontis,</HI> which
serve as Habitations to the Eyes, and
to defend them against all Injuries;
their external part is quite round, but
internally they grow Pyramidal, ha∣ving
at their bottom many perforati∣ons
for Vessels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Each Orbit is made up of part of
six different Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Each Orbit made up of six Bones.</NOTE> which altogether
composes its Cavity.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="37"/>
Five of which are Common, and
one Proper, which is call'd, as I have
already demonstrated, <HI>Os Vnguis vel
Lachrimale:</HI> Of the Common, three
belong to the <HI>Cranium,</HI> and two to the
Face; the first of those of the <HI>Crani∣um,</HI>
is the Coronal, which forms the
superior part; the second is the Eth∣moidal
Bone, which forms part of the
internal side next the Nose; the
third is the Sphenoidal, which makes
up part of the internal Cavity; the
two of the Face compose all its lower
part, the <HI>Os Triangulare</HI> forming that
part towards the lesser <HI>Canthus,</HI> and
the <HI>Maxillare,</HI> that next the greater.</P>
<P>The lower Jaw is but one continu∣ed
Bone in Adults,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inferior Jaw.</NOTE> but in young Bodies
is composed of two join'd together in
the fore-part, by <HI>Syncondrosis;</HI> they u∣nite,
and become one about the se∣venth
Year, of a somewhat Circular
Figure, or rather like the Greek Let∣ter
Ʋ, smooth and polished without,
but a little rough within, several
Muscles being inserted, and arising
from thence.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="37"/>
This in all Creatures is only move∣able,
except as some affirm in the Cro∣codile,
who moves the upper only.</P>
<P>The Parts to be consider'd in this
Bone, are its Processes, <HI>Foramina,</HI> and
<HI>Alveoli.</HI></P>
<P>It has two large Processes at each
end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Processes.</NOTE>
the first call'd <HI>Condiloides vel Ar∣ticularis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Condiloi∣des.</NOTE>
it's received into the <HI>Sinus</HI> of
the <HI>Os Petrosum,</HI> and fastned there by
a strong Membranous Ligament; the
motion of the Jaw depends on this Ar∣ticulation;
the other is call'd <HI>Corone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Corone.</NOTE>
which from a large <HI>Basis</HI> ends in a
sharp point; it lyes under the <HI>Os Ju∣gale,</HI>
the Tendon of the <HI>Musculus Tem∣poralis</HI>
is inserted into it; these Pro∣cesses
are in the superior part of the
Bone. In its inferior part, just where
it begins to turn up on each side, are
its Angles, to whose outward part the
Masseter Muscles are inserted, and the
<HI>Pterygoidei</HI> to the interior.</P>
<P>This Bone is somewhat hollow
within, containing a Meduller Juice.</P>
<P>It has four <HI>Foramina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina.</NOTE> two of which
are at the Roots of the Processes in the
inside, in which a Branch of the fifth
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>
pair of Nerves, together with the
sanguifying Vessels enter, and pass un∣der
the Roots of the Teeth, distribu∣ting
Branches to each as they pass;
the other two are in the fore-part of
the Chin, out of which come two
Twigs of the aforesaid Nerve, which
are spent on the Muscles and Skin of
the lower Jaw.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alveoli.</NOTE> It has also its <HI>Alveoli,</HI>
or Sockets for the Teeth, as the up∣per
Jaw.</P>
<P>The Uses of the lower Jaw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vses.</NOTE> besides
its adding to the Beauty of the Face,
is to help Mastication, and serves to
form the Voice.</P>
<P>The Teeth are the hardest of all the
Bones of the Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Teeth.</NOTE> having a peculiar
<HI>Cortex,</HI> are smooth, and fix'd in the
<HI>Alveoli</HI> of the Jaws, by <HI>Gomphosis.</HI></P>
<P>They are in number about Thirty∣two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number 32.</NOTE>
of three Ranks or Orders.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Incisores,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Incisores 8.</NOTE> or Cutters, four
in each Jaw plac'd in the fore-part,
and have commonly but one Phang or
Root; they are also call'd by some <HI>Ri∣sores,</HI>
they appearing when we laugh.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="38"/>
2. <HI>Canini,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Canini 4.</NOTE> or Dog-teeth, by some
the Eye-teeth, two in each Jaw, one
on each side the <HI>Incisores;</HI> they have
sometimes two Roots, but strong,
and crooked.</P>
<P>3. The last are call'd <HI>Molares,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Molares.</NOTE> or
Grinders, in number about twenty,
five on each side the <HI>Canini,</HI> and have
two or three Phangs.</P>
<P>The Teeth are not perfected all at
once, nor appear before a certain time,
when they force their way through
the Jaws and Gums; yet there are
Observations of some who have been
Born with Teeth; the first that appear
in Children, are for the most part the
superior Incisives, which is sometimes
sooner, sometimes later, but general∣ly
about the seventh, eighth, or ninth
Month; then in time come the <HI>Cani∣ni,</HI>
and lastly the <HI>Molares:</HI> When the
Teeth come to about the number of
twenty, there appears no more till a∣bout
the seventh Year, about which
time there appears four more: At
fourteen there comes four more,
and towards the twentieth Year the
last four, which are call'd Teeth of
<PB N="60" REF="39"/>
Wisdom, because they come at an
Age, when we ought to be Wise and
Serious.</P>
<P>The first twenty Teeth are call'd
Milk-teeth, which fall or shed about
the seventh Year, and new ones come
in their places.</P>
<P>I have seen some who have had new
Teeth, when they have been upwards
of Sixty Years, but this is not very
usual.</P>
<P>The Teeth have several Uses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vses.</NOTE> first,
they serve for Mastication, which is
its chief, the Teeth being as so many
Mill stones which bruise and grinde
the Aliment, the <HI>Incisores</HI> cut the Mor∣sel,
and the <HI>Molares</HI> grinde it. Second∣ly,
to help Articulation of the Voice,
for we see those that lose their Teeth,
especially the <HI>Incisores,</HI> do not speak
plain, but lisp, as we call it; they are
also Ornamental.</P>
<P>Since we are demonstrating the
Bones of the Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Hyoi∣des.</NOTE> it will not be amiss
to mention the Bone which is at the
Root of the Tongue, being united on∣ly
by Muscles; it's call'd <HI>Os Hyoides,</HI>
or <HI>Ypsiloides,</HI> by reason it's like the
Greek V.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="39"/>
It consists of two parts, the Body
and Horns which receive the <HI>Epi∣glottis.</HI></P>
<P>The principal Use of this Bone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse.</NOTE> is
not to support the Tongue, as some
pretend, but rather to facilitate the
entrance of Air into the <HI>Trachea Arte∣ria,</HI>
also of the Aliments into the <HI>Oeso∣phagus;</HI>
many Muscles also are inser∣ted
into this Bone.</P>
<P>The Bones of the <HI>Cranium</HI> being
join'd together,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Foramina,</HI> in the whole <HI>Cranium.</HI></NOTE> there are many <HI>Fora∣mina</HI>
or Holes, through which Vessels
pass and repass; to begin then in or∣der,
these appear first, and are com∣monly
by pairs.</P>
<P>1. There's a Hole which lyes be∣tween
the <HI>Crista Galli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramen, Crista Gal∣li.</NOTE> and the Process
of the <HI>Sinus Frontalis;</HI> it's a single
Hole, and mentioned by no Author as
I find: It may well be call'd <HI>Foramen
Nasale, vel Crista Galli;</HI> through this
Hole a Vessel passes from the <HI>Sinus Lon∣gitudinalis</HI>
of the <HI>Dura Mater</HI> to the
Nose, where it becomes double, one
to each Nostril; this is the way how
in great Commotions of the Brain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE>
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>
the Blood sometimes streams out, and
that with violence, the Vessel being
then more turgid.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Foramina</HI> in the <HI>Cribriforme</HI>
Bone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Ethmoides</NOTE> for the passage of the Olfactory
Nerves, and may be call'd <HI>Foramina
Ethmoides.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>The</HI> Foramina Opticorum Nervo∣rum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Opticorum</NOTE>
<HI>number two.</HI></P>
<P>4. Two for the <HI>Nervi Motorii,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Motorii.</NOTE> and

Holes.</P>
<P>5. Two call'd the <HI>Crotophite,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Temp.</NOTE> or
Temporal Holes, through which passes
two Branches of the fifth pair of
Nerves, to the Temples.</P>
<P>6. Two for the <HI>Arteriae Carotides,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Carotidum</NOTE>
which lye just by the sides of the lower
parts of the <HI>Sella Turcica.</HI></P>
<P>7. Two small ones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Durae Ma∣tris.</NOTE> one on each

<P><PB N="63" REF="40"/>
11. Two more for the Cervical Ar∣teries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Nervor. paris 5.</NOTE>
and also for the <HI>exit</HI> of some

<P>12. Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramen Medullare.</NOTE> the great one, call'd
<HI>Foramen Medullare,</HI> for the passage of
the Spinal Marrow.</P>
<P>All these Holes are in the <HI>Basis</HI> of
the Skull, or Internal Part.</P>
<P>There are also several <HI>Foramina,</HI> of
great use in the External Part.</P>
<P>1. Are two <HI>Foramina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Orbicula∣ria.</NOTE> or Holes,
one by the edge of the orbit of each
Eye, call'd <HI>Orbicularia,</HI> through which
passes a Branch of the fifth pair of
Nerves, to the Lips.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Foramina seu puncta Lachri∣malia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Lachrima∣lia.</NOTE>
in the Lachrimal Bones through
which the Tears pass into the Nose.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>Foramina Palati,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Palati.</NOTE> they are
plac'd in the fore-part of the Roof of

<P>4. Two in the back part of the Pa∣late,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Alia.</NOTE>
through which Branches of the
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>
fifth pair of Nerves pass to the Pa∣late.</P>

<HEAD>Demonstration IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bones of the Trunk.</HEAD>
<P>THE next part of the Skeleton
that is to be Demonstrated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Division, threefold.</NOTE> is
the Trunk, which we shall divide in∣to
Three Parts, as the Back or Spine,
Ribs and Breast; and lastly, the Hips,
or <HI>Ossa Innominata.</HI></P>
<P>The Back, or rather Spine, is com∣posed
of many Bones, call'd <HI>Vertebrae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vertebrae.</NOTE>
or Spondils, all which being join'd or
united together, may not unfitly be
term'd a Pyramid of Bones; but be∣fore
we Treat of them in particular, it
will be requisite to say something of
the Spine in General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Spine in General.</NOTE> in which several
Things are to be taken notice of.</P>
<P>1. All the Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Denomina∣tion.</NOTE> from the first of the
Neck, to the very Extremity of the
<HI>Coccigis,</HI> are call'd the Spine, I suppose
from the acute Processes each <HI>Vertebrae</HI>
have, call'd <HI>Spinales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="42"/>
2. The figure or shape of the Spine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figure.</NOTE>
is of great Consideration, for if you
look on its Anterior or Posterior Parts,
it appears streight; but if you look on
its Lateral Parts, its curved in and
out: First, the Spondils of the Neck
bend inwards, for the better support
of the <HI>Oesophagus,</HI> also to sustain the
Head in an <HI>Equilibrium,</HI> then the <HI>Ver∣tebrae</HI>
of the Back jet themselves out∣ward,
to augment the Capacity of the
<HI>Thorax,</HI> that the Heart and Lungs
may have a larger room to play in;
towards the Loins again, they bend
inwards, not only to defend the great
Vessels which lye on them, but al∣so
to Counterballance the better the
weight of the Body; the <HI>Os Sacrum</HI>
bends outward, that the <HI>Pelvis</HI> be in∣larged
to contain the Bladder, Womb
in Women, and <HI>Intestinum Rectum;</HI>
and lastly, the <HI>Os Coccygis</HI> bends in∣wards,
that it might not be offended
when we sit down, also that the <HI>Inte∣stinum
Rectum</HI> be tyed to it.</P>
<P>The third Thing to be observed in
General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodies of the <HI>Verte∣brae.</HI></NOTE> or Common to all, is that
the Bodies, of each <HI>Vertebra</HI> are of a
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>
spongy Substance, made up of many
irregular bony Threads, containing a
Medullar Juice, of a Convex Figure
forwards, but Concave backwards,
and plain above and below, being only
join'd with Cartilages, which makes
them Contiguous, &amp; unites them there,
which gives them a more easie moti∣on,
the Body also of each <HI>Vertebra</HI> gra∣dually
increases in bulk, till to the very
<HI>Os Sacrum;</HI> for it's reasonable that
those which support,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE> should be larger
than those which are supported, and
at the same time as the <HI>Spinalis Medul∣la</HI>
passes down it grows less, losing
of its bulk as the Nerves pass from it,
and the <HI>Foramina Medullares</HI> of each
<HI>Vertebra</HI> consequently less.</P>
<P>4. Each <HI>Vertebra</HI> have five Things
to be consider'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five things to be consi∣der'd in the <HI>Vertebra.</HI></NOTE> which belong to all;
1. Each, as I have said, have a Body.
2. Each have a great <HI>Foramina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Spinales.</NOTE>
through which the <HI>Spinalis Medulla</HI>
passes, even to the very <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI>
which may well be call'd <HI>Foramina
Spinalia vel Medullaria;</HI> these holes are
largest in the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck,
and so lessen as they descend, several
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>
Nerves, as I have hinted before,
passing from the Spinal Marrow, so
lessens them; but the Bodies grow lar∣ger
to sustain the rest, the Spinal Mar∣row
reaches no further than the last
<HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Back, where it begins
to divide into many small Filaments,
which are subdivided into smaller in
the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cauda E∣quina, quid?</NOTE> where it's call'd <HI>Cauda
Equina,</HI> or the Horse-tail. 3. They
have each seven Processes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Pro∣cesses in each <HI>Vertebra.</HI></NOTE> four ob∣lique
ones, two superior, and two in∣ferior,
two transverse, and an odd one
call'd <HI>Acutus, vel Spinalus,</HI> by some
<HI>Posterior.</HI> 4. They are join'd one to
another in their oblique Processes by
<HI>Ginglimus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conjunction.</NOTE> and by <HI>Synchondrosis</HI> in their
Bodies; also on their inside, they are
lin'd with a strong smooth Membrane,
which reaches from the first, to the <HI>Os
Sacrum.</HI> 5. They have many Sinuffes,
but the most remarkable, are those
under their oblique Processes, which
being united to others above the a∣foresaid
Processes of other <HI>Vertebrae,</HI>
make certain <HI>Foramina,</HI> through which
the Nerves of the Spinal Marrow
passes, as also many Blood-vessels to
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>
and from the <HI>Spinalis Medulla;</HI> they
may be aptly enough call'd <HI>Foramina

<P>We come now to Treat of each
<HI>Vertebra</HI> in particular;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Ver∣tebrae</HI> in particular. Number 25.</NOTE> the <HI>Vertebrae</HI>
are in number twenty-five; that is, se∣ven
of the Neck, twelve of the Back,
five of the Loins, and one of the <HI>Os
Sacrum,</HI> to which is annex'd the <HI>Ossa
Coccygis.</HI></P>
<P>The Neck has seven.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven of the Neck.</NOTE></P>
<P>The first is call'd <HI>Atlas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Atlas.</NOTE> by reason
is sustains the Head, as <HI>Atlas</HI> was sup∣posed
to do the Heavens; its transverse
Processes, as also all the other of the
Neck, are not so long as those of the
Back; it's Articulated to the Condi∣loid
Processes of the <HI>Os Occipitis,</HI> by its
superior oblique Processes, in which
are two <HI>Sinus</HI>'s that receives the afore∣said
Condiloid Processes; this Articu∣lation
is a sort of double <HI>Arthrodia,</HI> so
is only capable of Flexion and Exten∣tion;
it has very little, or no Body,
but within has a small <HI>Sinus</HI> to receive
the <HI>Dens</HI> of the second <HI>Vertebra;</HI> this
<HI>Sinus</HI> is lin'd with a strong Ligament,
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>
which fastens the aforesaid <HI>Dens,</HI> the
Spinal Process is a very little blunt
knob, but all the other Spines of the
Neck are forked, except the last. It
has a small round Process in its upper
part where the Body should be, from
which passes a small Ligament, to ano∣ther
small round Process between the
<HI>Condiloides</HI> of the Occipital Bone, close
to the <HI>Foramen Medullare.</HI></P>
<P>The second <HI>Vertebra</HI> is call'd <HI>Denta∣ta
vel Epistrophous,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Dentata.</NOTE> because between
its two superior Processes, springs ano∣ther
very hard one, call'd <HI>Dens,</HI> being
like a little Tooth, which being re∣ceived
into the above-mentioned <HI>Sinus</HI>
of the first <HI>Vertebra,</HI> and encompassed
with strong Membranous Ligaments;
this moves in the <HI>Atlas</HI> as an <HI>Axis,</HI> as
the Flexion and Extention depend on
the first <HI>Vertebra</HI> with the Head;<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> the
Circular Motion depends on this and
the first: When a Luxation happens
here, the Neck is said to be broke.</P>
<P>The five following have no particu∣lar
Name, and are much like one ano∣ther,
only increasing a little in bigness,
and the Spinal Process of the last is
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>
not fork'd, beginning to grow some∣what
like those of the Back; the trans∣verse
Processes, and spinous ones, are
somewhat rough, for the better in∣sertion
of many Muscles, which are
fastned there.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Neck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramina Vertebra∣rum Colli▪</NOTE> have
two small <HI>Foramina</HI> each, which lye
in the Head of the transverse Processes,
serving for the passage of the Verte∣bral
Arteries.</P>
<P>Their oblique Processes have this ob∣servable
in them, their superior ones
are somewhat hollowish, to receive the
inferior Convex ones, that the moti∣on
of the Neck be freer.</P>
<P>The Back has twelve <HI>Vertebrae;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Back 12.</NOTE> yet
I once saw a Skeleton that had thir∣teen,
and thirteen Ribs; they are
bigger than those of the Neck, but
less then those of the Loins; their Spi∣nal
Processes are not fork'd but pointed,
and lye one over another; the trans∣verse
are short, but large, and blunt,
and have a Cavity to receive the
Heads of the Ribs; the oblique are
sharp, and smooth, and so conse∣quently
little motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vertebrae Costales.</NOTE> these are call'd
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>
the Costal <HI>Vertebrae;</HI> the eleventh <HI>Ver∣tebra</HI>
has its spinal Process, not lying
over the other, as those above it.</P>
<P>The last <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Back has
this to be observed in it; it receives
none, but is received, both by the
eleventh of the Back, and first of the
Loins; on this depends the greatest
motion of the Back.</P>
<P>The five of the Loins are larger than
those of the Back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loins 5.</NOTE> and their Articu∣lation
looser, their transverse Pro∣cesses
are more long and fine than
those of the Back, which serve as
Ribs, as it were, yet the first and fifth
are shorter than the rest; their <HI>Fora∣mina
Nervina</HI> are excavated only out
of the lower <HI>Vertebra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B.</NOTE> whereas those
of the Back equally out of both, but
those of the Neck only out of the su∣perior;
their posterior Spines, are
short, blunt and thick, a little broad,
and turn a little upwards, that the
bending of the Body be no way hin∣dred;
and whereas in the other <HI>Ver∣tebrae,</HI>
the upper oblique Processes re∣ceive
the lower, in these the lower re∣ceive
the upper.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="45"/>
The first of these <HI>Vertebrae</HI> is call'd
<HI>Renalis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Renalis.</NOTE>
the Kidneys being lodged at
the side of it; the other four have no
particular Name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Sacrum.</NOTE> or holy Bone, so
call'd, as some think, because the An∣tients
used to save this part as Sacred
in Sacrifices; but I think rather from
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as the Greeks call it, which
signifies <HI>Magnum,</HI> as well as <HI>Sacrum,</HI>
it being the biggest Bone of all the
Spine. It's immoveable, and serves
as a <HI>Basis</HI> or Pedestal to the whole
Spine; it's of a somewhat triangular
Figure, with the point downwards;
it's Concavous within, which helps
to form the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> also smooth; be∣hind
it's <HI>Convex,</HI> and unequal, many
Muscles arising, and being inserted
here, it seems as if it were composed
of five or six Bones, (as indeed it is in
Infants) its Ossification beginning at
so many points, but its edges, or ra∣ther,
if you will, its transverse Pro∣cesses
look but like one continued
Bone, as it is; the <HI>Foramen Spinale</HI>
towards its lower part is very small;
its <HI>Foramina Nervina</HI> are before and
<PB N="74" REF="46"/>
behind, and not on the sides, as in the
other <HI>Vertebrae;</HI> its spinal Processes
are very small, the last being only a
small round Protuberance, it ob∣lique
Processes are hardly visible, ex∣cept
the superior ones; the parts
which compose the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> are
plac'd in the number of the <HI>Vertebrae,</HI>
not by reason of their use, but because
of their resemblance, for otherwise
they are immoveable: The <HI>Os Sacrum</HI>
may be said to be divided into five
<HI>Vertebrae</HI> of different bigness, whereof
the superior is biggest, they diminish∣ing
as they descend, the last being the
least; these seperate easily in Infants,
by reason the Cartilages which unite
them, are not fully ossified; but in A∣dults,
they all make up but one intire
Bone.</P>
<P>This Bone seems to have several
Uses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vses.</NOTE> the first is, as I have already re∣mark'd,
to serve as a Foundation to
the whole Spine. Secondly, to help
to contain the parts of the <HI>Hypogastri∣um,</HI>
by forming Cavity, as I have
said. The third to defend them; the
fourth to Articulate the Bones of the
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
Hips; the fifth to give Origin and In∣sertion
to many Muscles.</P>
<P>To the end of this Bone are annex'd
two or three little Bones call'd <HI>Ossa
Coccygis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ossa Coc∣cygis.</NOTE>
the Cuckow's Beak; some
call them the Rump-bones: They
have a somewhat loose Articulation,
and tyed by Cartilages one to ano∣ther,
the last is the smallest: They
have this loose Articulation, that
they may give way to the <HI>Foetus</HI> in
the Birth, therefore in Women these
Bones are always more bent back∣wards
than in Men; they end in a
Cartilaginous point, to which is tyed
the <HI>Intestinum Rectum;</HI> they have no
thing more material in them, having
neither Process nor Cavity.</P>
<P>We shall now proceed to the Bones
of the Breast and Ribs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bones of the Breast.</NOTE> which is the
second Division of the Trunk.</P>
<P>The Ribs are twenty-four in num∣ber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ribs 24.</NOTE>
twelve on each side; to be well-instructed
in all which concerns the
Ribs, we must observe several things,
as their Substance, Figure, Connexi∣ons,
Parts, Division and Use, of all
which in order.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="47"/>
The substance of the Ribs is partly
Bony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Substance of the Ribs.</NOTE> and partly Cartilaginous, that
end next the <HI>Vertebra,</HI> being of a har∣der
and more solid and thick substance
than that towards the <HI>Sternon,</HI> which
is flattish, so less capable of being
broke; sor that end towards the <HI>Ster∣non</HI>
being more spongy in substance,
all the Ribs end towards the Breast by
Cartilages, increasing in length as the
Ribs descend; and those Cartilages of
the superior Ribs, are harder than
those of the inferior; sometimes these
Cartilages grow bony in Old People,
so that they cannot be separated by a
Knife.</P>
<P>The Ribs have a sort of Semicircu∣lar
Figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figure.</NOTE> making a sort of Arch;
when two are together, they make a
kind of a true Circle, Concave inward∣ly,
to form the Capacity of the <HI>Tho∣rax,</HI>
and to contain the Lungs and
Heart, and Convex outwardly, to re∣sist
outward force; the farther they
depart from the <HI>Sternon,</HI> the more
round they are in their own Body;
they are not equally big, for the supe∣rior
are shorter, the middle biggest of
<PB N="77" REF="47"/>
all, and the inferior one least of all;
their upper sides are thick, blunt, and
broad; one edge is call'd the interior,
the other the exterior Lip; their un∣der
edges are sharp, having in their
inside a long <HI>Sinus,</HI> or Furrow, in
which lye the Intercostal Vessels.</P>
<P>The Ribs are Articulated by their
Extremities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articulati∣on.</NOTE> both to the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of
the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and <HI>Sternon;</HI> that Articu∣lation
with the Back is moveable, the
other not; the long Head of each Rib
is Articulated by a single <HI>Arthrodia;</HI>
it has a small Protuberance cloathed
with a Cartilage, which head is re∣ceived
into a <HI>Sinus</HI> of the transverse
Process of the <HI>Vertebra;</HI> 'tis this Pro∣cess
which supports the Ribs, and hin∣ders
them from coming lower in Ex∣piration:
You must observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B.</NOTE> that the
back-part of every Rib is higher than
the fore-part, till the Cartilage be
join'd, which turning a little up,
makes the two ends of an equal
height, so that by the rising of the
Ribs, the Breast is enlarged. We must
also take notice, that almost all the
Ribs have a Communication with the
<PB N="78" REF="48"/>
<HI>Sternon,</HI> either directly or indirectly;
that is, the superior ones are by a di∣rect
insertion, but the lower by an in∣direct,
which is by Cartilages adhe∣ring
to the superior.</P>
<P>All the Ribs make a sort of Angle
by their Cartilages towards the <HI>Ster∣non,</HI>
which serves to increase the
Spring of the Cartilages, that the
Ribs be brought down again, having
been rais'd in Inspiration. It some∣times
happens, though seldom, that
these Cartilages are ossified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> which
occasions an Incurable <HI>Asthma;</HI> the
last, or lowest Rib in Man, have no
Cartilage as the rest; the lower
the Ribs, are, longest and more
movable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B.</NOTE> because Respiration in Man
is downwards, but in Birds up∣wards.</P>
<P>The Ribs are commonly divided in
two sorts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ribs of two sorts.</NOTE> as true or false, but I think
they may well be all accounted true,
except the last, (being join'd mediate∣or
immediately to the <HI>Sternon</HI> by Car∣tilages)
which has none, so only may
be term'd a false Rib; however it be∣ing
a common received Opinion, I
<PB N="79" REF="48"/>
shall make the division: the long or
true are seven on each side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">True 14.</NOTE> and are
the superior ones; the first of which
has no motion at all, it being as a
prop for all the rest, but as they de∣scend
they increase in motion; they
are Articulated to the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the
Back by a sort of double <HI>Arthrodia,</HI>
which makes a <HI>Ginglimus,</HI> and to the
<HI>Sternon</HI> by <HI>Synarthrosis,</HI> the three low∣est
of which are by some call'd the
Pectoral Ribs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Costae Pe∣ctorales.</NOTE></P>
<P>The false or bastard are five on each
side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">False, 10.</NOTE> the four uppermost of which
have at their Extremities towards the
<HI>Sternon</HI> long Cartilages, bending up∣wards,
and cleaving only one to ano∣ther;
that is, the lowest to the supe∣rior,
so not directly united to the
<HI>Sternon,</HI> as the first seven are; which
was the Reason the Antients gave
them the Name of Spurious: The last
has no Cartilage at its end, the edge of
the <HI>Diaphragme</HI> being tyed to it.</P>
<P>All the Ribs, as I have already de∣monstrated,
are received both into
the transverse Processes, and body of
the <HI>Vertebrae;</HI> except the two or three
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>
last, which are only received into the
body of the <HI>Vertebrae.</HI></P>
<P>The Ribs are to defend the Heart
and Lungs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from all sorts of ex∣ternal
Injuries, so that they be not
prest, but have free motion, which
were it not bony, would be always in
danger of being offended; they also
serve to sustain the Respiratory Mus∣cles.</P>
<P>The Cartilages of the Ribs have this
Use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse of the Cartilages.</NOTE> that is, when the Ribs are drawn
something upwards in Inspiration,
they draw them down again with a
sort of Spring; for all Cartilaginous
Bodies are indued with a sort of Ela∣sticity,
so that they always recover
their first Figure.</P>
<P>This Mechanism is observed in va∣rious
Animals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> for in Birds the <HI>Ster∣non</HI>
is immovable, because the flying
Muscles arise from thence; so that if
the <HI>Sternon</HI> had any thing to do in Re∣spiration,
it would be hinder'd;
therefore Nature has contrived another
Artifice, which is this, between eve∣ry
Rib there's a little Bone, plac'd
somewhat obliquely, so that if one
<PB N="81" REF="49"/>
moves, the other follow by con∣sent.</P>
<P>All these Birds have no Diaphragm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE>
but instead thereof two Bladders,
which reach to the bottom of their
Bellies, they serve for the <HI>Diaphrag∣ma,</HI>
and also help to keep them sus∣pended
in the Air: Those Creatures
which have a <HI>Diaphragma,</HI> breathe
downwards, but Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
have none, breathe upwards.</P>
<P>In Amphibious Creatures, as the
Tortoise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their shell is in place
of Ribs, and Frogs have only one Rib
on a side, to defend the Lungs.</P>
<P>The Breast-bone is call'd <HI>Sternon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sternon <HI>made up of three Bones.</HI></NOTE> or
<HI>Os Pectoris,</HI> situated in the middle of
the Anterior part of the Breast, com∣posed
of two or three Bones, having
the Productions of the Cartilages of
the Ribs inserted into their sides, of a
reddish fungous Substance.</P>
<P>To consider it well, it must be exa∣mined
at two different times; for in
Infants it's almost all Cartilaginous,
except the first Bone where the <HI>Clavi∣culae</HI>
are fastned. In Old People I have
seen it all ossified, except the first
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>
with the second at its juncture, but in
those of Middle Age, partly Bony,
and partly Cartilaginous, the supe∣rior
Bone always ossifies first, and the
inferior last. In the <HI>Sternon</HI> of Infants
you may perceive seven or eight Jun∣ctures,
as if so many Bones, but in
the seventh or eighth Year, they uni∣ting,
make up but three or four at
most.</P>
<P>The first or superior Bone of the
<HI>Sternon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">First Bone.</NOTE> is more thick and solid than
the rest, made in the shape of a Cres∣cent
almost, at each side of its superior
part, it has a <HI>Sinus</HI> to receive the head
of the <HI>Clavicula;</HI> at its top it has a Lu∣nated
<HI>Sinus</HI> call'd <HI>Jugulum;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jugulum.</NOTE> it has al∣so
a small long <HI>Sinus</HI> on its inside, to
give way to the <HI>Aspera Arteria:</HI> It's
immovable.</P>
<P>The second Bone is narrower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Bone.</NOTE> lon∣ger
and thinner, having at its sides
many Sinosities, to receive the Carti∣lages
of the Ribs.</P>
<P>The third Bone is less than the se∣cond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third Bone.</NOTE>
but broader, at the lower end
of which is annex'd a Cartilage call'd
<HI>Xiphoides, vel Mucroconita, vel Ensi∣formis,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="50"/>
the Sword-like Cartilage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cartilago Ensiformis.</NOTE> it's
of a Triangular Figure, it serves to
defend the superior Orifice of the Sto∣mach:
It's this place which is call'd
<HI>Scrobiculus Cordis,</HI> the Heart-pit; the
<HI>Diaphragma</HI> is also fastned to it; a
strong Ligament of the Liver, call'd
<HI>Suspensorium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> is tyed to it, for in In∣spiration
the Ribs being draw up∣wards,
then the Liver by its weight
keeps this from moving, and when in
Exspiration the Ribs assume their for∣mer
Figure, this by its Cartilaginous
Spring assumes his also.</P>
<P>The Uses of the <HI>Sternon</HI> are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vses of the Sternon.</NOTE> first,
to unite the Ribs, that their motion
may be all at one and the same time,
also to receive the <HI>Clavicula:</HI> Lastly,
to fasten the <HI>Mediastinum,</HI> which is a
Membrane that divides the Breast in
two.</P>
<P>The third part that compose the
Trunk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ossa Inno∣minata.</NOTE> are call'd <HI>Ossa Innominata,</HI> be∣cause
of a very strange Figure; they
are in number two, one on each side of
the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> having where they are
united to it, many Depressions and
Risings, for their greater Strength and
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>
Connexion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articulati∣on.</NOTE> being Articulated before
by <HI>Synchondrosis,</HI> so make up that Ca∣vity
call'd the <HI>Pelvis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pelvis.</NOTE> which contains
the (Womb in Women) Bladder,
and <HI>Intestinum Rectum,</HI> with other of
the Guts.</P>
<P>In Children each Bone consists of
three,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Each con∣sists of three in Children.</NOTE> all of them meeting in that
deep Cavity, call'd <HI>Acetabulum,</HI> which
receives the head of the <HI>Fenier,</HI> but as
we grow in Years they all make but
one Bone, yet then, for better distin∣ction,
nam'd as three, as the <HI>Os Ile∣um,

in order.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ileum</HI> is the superior part of the

Face; from it's External arise the
<HI>Musculi Glutei:</HI> It's the biggest of
the three, and join'd with the <HI>Os Sa∣crum.</HI></P>
<P>Things to be consider'd in this Bone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spina Ilei.</NOTE>
are, first, its Figure, which is Semi∣circular.
Secondly, its top, which is
call'd the Ridg, Comb, or Spine, be∣ing
covered with a Cartilage: Its In∣ternal
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>
Face is Concave, and its Exte∣rior
Convex: It has three Protube∣rances,

<P>The <HI>Os Ischium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Ischium</NOTE> or <HI>Coxendicis,</HI> is
the lower part of the <HI>Os Innomina∣tum,</HI>
in which is to be consider'd two
parts; first, It's Superior, which

or <HI>Acetabulum.</HI> Secondly, Its In∣ferior,
or lower part, which we sit
on, which is call'd <HI>Tuberositas Ischii;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tuberosi∣tas.</NOTE> it
has a Sinuosity on its inner side, where
the <HI>Musculus Obturator Internus</HI> winds
about; the Muscles of the <HI>Penis,</HI> and
Elevators of the <HI>Anus,</HI> have their Ori∣gin
from the Tuberosity of the <HI>Is∣chium.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Os Pubis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Pubis.</NOTE> or <HI>Pectinis,</HI> by us the

part of it forms part of the <HI>Acetabulum;</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>
the superior part is call'd the Spine, to
which the Muscles of the <HI>Abdomen</HI> are
fastned; where this joins with the
<HI>Ischium</HI> there's large <HI>Foramen,</HI> call'd
<HI>Ovale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foramen Ovale Ossis Pubis.</NOTE> cover'd with very a strong Li∣gamentous

<HI>Foramen</HI> there's <HI>Sinus,</HI> by which the
Crural Vessels pass to the Thigh.</P>
<P>All these Bones being join'd toge∣ther
in their middle, make up that
deep Cavity call'd <HI>Acetabulum, vel Co∣tula,</HI>
in which the head of the <HI>Os Fe∣moris</HI>
enters, which is tipt with a

<P>These Bones are more ample and
large in Women than Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ossa Pubis,</HI> largest in Women.</NOTE> and those

<P>The Antients believed, that in La∣bour

more easie Delivery of the Birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ossa Pubis</HI> do not separate in Labour.</NOTE> nay,
<HI>Bartholinus</HI> is of this Opinion, for he
says, that in a Woman newly Deli∣ver'd,
you may divide them with
the back of a Knife; but I presume it's
not so, for they separate not the least;
'tis only the <HI>Os Coccygis</HI> which gives
<PB N="87" REF="52"/>
way a little by bending backwards,
for most pain is felt when the <HI>Foetus</HI>
passes by the Fundament; yet some
have a more loose Articulation of their
Bones, and so perhaps might bring
them into this Error.</P>

<HEAD>Demonstration IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Bones of the Superior
Extremities.</HEAD>
<P>I Have Demonstrated all the Bones
which make up the two parts of
the Skeleton, there remains now only
the third part, which is those of the
Extremities.</P>
<P>The Extremities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extremi∣ties, Vpper and Lower.</NOTE> or rather the
Limbs, are either Superior, as the
Arms; or Inferior, as the Legs.</P>
<P>We will begin with the Superior;
but first I must inform you, that since
both Extremities are double, I shall
only speak of them in the singular num∣ber,
for by demonstrating one side,
you at the same time shew the other.</P>
<P>Although there be no part which
does not furnish us with some Subject
of Admiration, yet we must all agree,
that the Arm hath as great a share,
if not more, than any other; for which
reason <HI>Aristotle</HI> call'd it the Organ of
<PB N="89" REF="53"/>
Organs, and the Instrument of Instru∣ments;
and since Nature has given
to all Animals, something particular,
either to defend themselves against
others, and preserve themselves from
external Injuries; or else to offend;
we may say then, that Man has re∣ceived
two things preferable to Ani∣mals,
to wit, Reason and Hands, the
one for Counsel and Conduct, the o∣ther
for Execution of our Will; 'tis
these Hands which gives him the So∣veraign
Command over all Creatures
be he never so Cruel, Strong, or
Swift; for of what Advantage would
all our Reason and Conduct be, if we
had not Hands to perform what Rea∣son
dictates: I could say much more
on this Subject, but that I am here on
plain Demonstration, and not Philo∣sophizing.</P>
<P>The Arm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Division. Arm, five parts.</NOTE> generally so called, has
five parts, as the <HI>Clavicula, Scapula,</HI>
Shoulder, Arm, and Hand, of all
which in due course.</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Clavicula,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clavicula▪</NOTE> which some place

<PB N="90" REF="54"/>
think it rather belongs to those of the
Arms, as I shall shew in its use, the
whole motion of the Arm depending
on this Bone; It's call'd <HI>Clavicula,</HI> I
suppose, being a diminutive from <HI>Cla∣vis</HI>
a Key, because the Keys in old time
were like an s<NOTE PLACE="marg">Figure.</NOTE> in <HI>Padua</HI> they have
such sort of Keys still, as I am in∣form'd

The Inferior part of this Bone has
two Eminencies, and one Cavity;
the first of the Eminencies is seated at

Glenoid Cavity of the <HI>Radius:</HI> The
second is at the very Extremity, and

<P>The <HI>Radius</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Radius.</NOTE> is the second Bone of

so call'd, because it resembles
the Spoke of a Wheel;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articulati∣on.</NOTE> it's Articula∣ted
in its superior part, two manner of

<P>In its middle it has an obtuse Angle,
which some call the Spine, which
gradually grows bigger as it inclines
towards the <HI>Carpus,</HI> different from the

that we may admire Nature, which
<PB N="100" REF="59"/>
not being able to avoid making these
two Bones unequal in their Extremi∣ties,
has found means to make the
Arm equally strong in all parts, by
placing the weakest part of one Bone
against the strongest of the other.</P>
<P>At its Inferior part many Sinuosities
appear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inferior part.</NOTE> which are as small Gutters,
that so the Tendons be not incommo∣ded;
it has also a Cavity at its Extre∣mity,
which receives one of the Bones

a blunt Process,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mastoides.</NOTE> call'd <HI>Mastoides:</HI>
from the Internal Angle of this Bone,
there's a long broad Ligamentous
Membrane, which unites it to the In∣ternal
Angle of the <HI>Ulna,</HI> according to
its length.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ulna</HI> serves only for Flexion
and Extension,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse of the <HI>Radius</HI> and <HI>Ulna.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Radius</HI> for

<P>The fifth and last part of the Arm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. Hand.</NOTE>

are received into the Cavity of the <HI>Ra∣dius</HI>

and received in the Cavity at the lower
Extremity of the <HI>Ulna;</HI> the fourth of
the first rank which lyes on the out∣side,
a little out of its rank, is the least
of the four: The four Bones of the se∣cond
rank are join'd together on their
sides by <HI>Harmonia,</HI> as the Bones of the
first rank are, also one to another so;
but at their ends, to the Bones of the
<HI>Metacarpus</HI> by <HI>Enarthrosis,</HI> having an
obscure motion: The first Bone of
this rank is seated more within the
Hand, that the Thumb be better su∣stain'd;
the second and third sustain
the first and second Bone of the <HI>Meta∣carpus;</HI>
the fourth Bone of this second
rank sustains the third and fourth
Bones of the <HI>Metacarp,</HI> by its two Gle∣noid
Cavities: All these Bones are
Convex on the back-part, but hollow∣ish
<PB N="102" REF="60"/>
within,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> for the more safe passage

<HI>Musculi Flexores,</HI> being likewise guard∣ed
by the <HI>Ligamentum Anulare</HI> which
covers them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ligamen∣tum Anu∣lare.</NOTE> and joins together all
these Bones.</P>
<P>The <HI>Metacarpus</HI> is composed of four
long hollowish Bones,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Metacar∣pus,</HI> four Bones.</NOTE> containing
Marrow in their Internal Sinusses;
there are some who make five Bones
of the <HI>Metacarp,</HI> and for that end add
thereto the first Bone of the Thumb,
but it ought not to be numerated a∣mong
those of the <HI>Metacarp,</HI> it having
a manifest, but the others a very ob∣scure
Motion.</P>
<P>These four Bones are united by their
Superior Extremities with the <HI>Carpus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Articulati∣on.</NOTE>

but Concave inwardly; all their Ex∣tremities
are tipt with Cartilages.</P>
<P>These four Bones are not of an equal
bigness, for that which sustains the
<HI>Index</HI> is the largest, that which su∣stains
the middle Finger less, and so
on to the very last, which is least of
all.</P>
<P>The Fingers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fingers.</NOTE> counting the Thumb,
are five, having three Bones each;
these Orders may be well call'd <HI>Pha∣langi
Digitorum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phalangi Digitorum.</NOTE> the first largest, the

to the <HI>Metacarp,</HI> and so have all sorts
of Motion, but the other Joints have
only Flexion and Extension: The least
Bones are not hollow as the rest, but
spongy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> call the Hand in general
<HI>Cheir,</HI> but the Thumb <HI>Antichier,</HI> as
much as to say, an opposite Hand: The
second Finger, counting the Thumb
as one, is call'd <HI>Indicator,</HI> because we

shew something: The third is call'd
the Middle-Finger, because of its situa∣tion,
and is the longest of all: The
fourth is call'd the Annular, by reason
Rings are used the most upon this Fin∣ger:
The fifth and least is call'd the
Auricular, being most fit to pick the

lyes the Neck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cervix.</NOTE> which is long, and lyes

never have entred conveniently into
the <HI>Acetabulum,</HI> considering its posture

conveniently and surely.</P>
<P>At this Extremity or End lyes two
<HI>Apophyses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trochan∣ters.</NOTE> behind the Neck, call'd
<HI>Trochanters,</HI> which are derived from

to turn, because many of the Mus∣cles
of the Thigh, especially the <HI>Rota∣tores,</HI>
are fastned to these Protube∣rances,
the Anterior and Upper one
is the biggest, the Posterior and Lower
the less: the outward part of this Bone
is smooth, but rough within, many
Muscles arising from thence: This
<PB N="107" REF="62"/>
Bone has a large long Cavity all its
length, full of Marrow; it's of a
crooked Figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE> so that Surgeons in
Fractures of this Bone, ought well to

of the <HI>Tibia;</HI> between these two
Processes is a <HI>Sinus</HI> which receives a

<P>The <HI>Tibia</HI> is the biggest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tibia.</NOTE> hollow
within, and full of Marrow, it's partly
Triangular; its sharp Angle of Spine
makes that we call the Shin; it has a
ridge like a Process at its upper end,
which is received by the <HI>Sinus</HI> at the
extremity of the <HI>Femur;</HI> on each side
of this Process, there's two longish,
<PB N="108" REF="63"/>
shallow Cavities, to receive the two
lower Eminences of the <HI>Femur:</HI> These
shallow Cavities are deepned by a lu∣nated
Cartilage, which is thick about
the edges, but grows thin towards
the Centre; as this Bone approaches
towards the <HI>Tarsus</HI> it lessens, but
grows more solid; at the lower part
of the <HI>Tibia</HI> there's notable Process
which makes the Internal Ancle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malleolus Internus.</NOTE>
which hinders the luxation of the
Foot, in keeping in firm: At the bot∣tom
of the <HI>Tibia</HI> there's a <HI>Sinus,</HI> which

this Bone supports the whole
Body.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fibula,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fibula.</NOTE> or <HI>Perone,</HI> is as long

<P>Some believe it's to strengthen the
Articulation of the Joint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse.</NOTE> but it's no
such thing, it being rather plac'd to

is of a very strange figure, in which is
to be consider'd its six Faces: First,
the Superior, which is very smooth
and convex, Articulated with the <HI>Ti∣bia,</HI>
hedged in by both <HI>Malleoli:</HI> Se∣condly,
its Anterior, which is a great
head which enters the Cavity of the
<HI>Os Naviculare,</HI> with which it's strong∣ly
Articulated: Thirdly, the Poste∣rior,
which has a Protuberance recei∣ved
by the <HI>Os Calcis:</HI> Fourthly, the In∣ferior,
which is rough and unequal,
<PB N="111" REF="64"/>
rising in some places, and sinking in
others: The fifth and sixth are the
two Lateral Faces, hedged in, as I
said, by the <HI>Malleoli;</HI> it serves as a
<HI>Basis</HI> to sustain the <HI>Tibia,</HI> which sup∣ports
the whole Body.</P>
<P>The second Bone is the <HI>Os Calcis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Calcis.</NOTE> or
Heel bone, the biggest and largest of
the seven, but most porous of all; it's
this Bone which hinders the Body
from falling backwards, being seated
at the Posterior part of the Foot; it
lyes uner the <HI>Talus,</HI> to which it's
Articulated; it's also join'd with a
flat head to the <HI>Os Cuboides;</HI> behind it
has a long Process, to which is tyed
the great Tendon, call'd <HI>Nervus He∣ctoricus,
vel Achillis;</HI> it has a large
<HI>Sinus</HI> on its inside, by which the Ten∣dons
pass under the Foot, it's very un∣equal
on its outside, for the insertion
of Ligaments and Tendons.</P>
<P>The third is call'd <HI>Os Scaphoides,
Cymbiforme, vel Naviculare,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Navicu∣lare.</NOTE> the Boat-like
Bone, behind it has a large Cavi∣ty,
wherein the head of the <HI>Astrga∣lus</HI>
is received: but before it has three
Eminences, which unites it to the <HI>Ossa
Cuneiformia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="65"/>
The fourth has a somewhat un∣equal
Figure of six irregular sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Cuboi∣des.</NOTE>
therefore call'd <HI>Cuboides,</HI> the Die-like
Bone, by some <HI>Multiforme;</HI> in its
fore-part it's join'd to the fourth and
fifth Bone of the Metatarse, behind to
the <HI>Os Calcis,</HI> its inside to the <HI>Ossa Cu∣neiformia;</HI>
it lyes on the outside of the
Foot, and sustains the little Toes.</P>
<P>The other three are call'd <HI>Ossa Cu∣neiformia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ossa Cu∣neiformia.</NOTE>
or Wedge-like Bones, and
lye all in a rank, but differ in bigness
one from another, join'd behind to
the <HI>Os Naviculare,</HI> and before to the
three first Bones of the <HI>Metatarsus:</HI>
These Bones are Convex outwardly,
but hollowish within, for the more
safe passage of the Vessels; there's a
broad Ligament which passes from the
<HI>Os Calcis</HI> to the Bones of the <HI>Metatar∣sus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ligamen∣tum Latum.</NOTE>
under which the Vessels and Mus∣cles
lye; for if there were no such, in
long standing on the Foot, the action
of the Muscles, and circulation of the
Juices would have been hindred: It's
a sort of <HI>Ligamentum Annulare.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Metatarsus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Metatarsus.</NOTE> or Instep, is com∣posed
of five long Bones, placed at the
<PB N="113" REF="65"/>
side of each other, to sustain each a
Toe, very close where they are uni∣ted
to the <HI>Tarsus,</HI> but part a little in
their middle, to give place to the <HI>Mus∣culi
Interossei;</HI>
convex outwardly, but
hollow within, for the better lying of
the Muscles, and passage of the Ves∣sels;
their lower ends are round, and
received into the Cavities of the first
Phalanx of the Bones of the Toes by
<HI>Arthrodia;</HI> that which sustains the
great Toe the biggest, the next less,
and so on to the least of all.</P>
<P>The Bones of the Toes are in num∣ber
14,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Digiti Pe∣dis.</NOTE> for all have three Bones each,
except the great Toe, which has only
two; their Articulation the same as
in the Fingers and the same Observa∣tions.</P>
<P>There are sometimes, found in the
Articulations of the Fingers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ossa Sesa∣moidea.</NOTE> but espe∣cially
in the Toes, some very small
Bones, call'd <HI>Ossa Sesamoidea,</HI> Seed-like
Bones, because they resemble
much the <HI>Semina Sesami;</HI> they are
fastned only by Ligaments in num∣ber
uncertain, sometimes more, some∣times
less, in some none at all.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="66"/>
They have the same Use as the <HI>Patella.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Bones of the Foot being all united
together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> may well be compar'd to a Lever
plac'd under any great weight, which we
intend to raise; for the convex part of the
<HI>Talus</HI> being plac'd just under the <HI>Tibia,</HI>
which, as I have shew'd, sustains the whole
Body; the long hinder Process of the <HI>Os
Calcis,</HI> being, as it were, the handle of this
Lever, and so rais'd, (as by the Hands) by
the <HI>Nervus Hectoricus,</HI> which is strongly
inserted there: This Nerve, or rather Ten∣don,
is composed of three or four Tendons
of several Muscles of the Leg, as <HI>Solaris,
Gastrochnemii,</HI> &amp;c. and with it the whole
Body is rais'd, as may be seen when we rear
our selves on our Toes.</P>
<P>There's one thing very Curious to ob∣serve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B.</NOTE>
in the bending of the Joints of the
Skeleton; for all the Junctures of the
Arms, as Elbow, Wrist, and Fingers, bend
upwards, but otherwise in the Legs; for
at the Thigh it bends forwards, that we
may sit when weary; at the Ham back∣wards,
at the Ankle forwards again, and
the Toes backwards: All these several
bendings give us a greater strength, both
to walk, and rise when down, which we
could not do, if the bendings were other∣wise
disposed.</P>

<HEAD>AN
APPENDIX
TO THE
Doctrine of the Bones;
SHEWING,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Best Method of Whitening,
Cleansing, and Preparing the Bones
of Man's Body, for making a Mova∣ble
Skeleton, wherein the Bones
may have the same Motions, as in
a Living Subject; together with
the manner of Uniting them toge∣ther.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you have a Body, that you in∣tend
to save the Bones, towards
forming a skeleton, proceed in this man∣ner▪</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="67"/>
First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Bone to be lost.</NOTE> Take Care that in Decarning the
Bones, you lose none, although never so
small, for by so doing you will spoil the
Beauty of your Skeleton; also be Cautious
lest you cut away any of the Substance of the
Bones with your knife, which if you are
not aware you may do, especially when
you come towards the more Spongy, and
Cartilaginous Extremities of them; as in
the Bones of the Breast, Cartilaginous
parts of the Ribs, and <HI>Cartilago Ensifor∣mis,</HI>
also the <HI>Processus Styloides</HI> of the <HI>Basis</HI>
of the <HI>Cranium,</HI> is very apt to be separated,
unless you are careful, especially in young
Subjects; but if by chance you lose any of
the small Bones, get one in its place from
any other Skeleton, and about the same
bigness; also if you happen to break any
Bone, join it again with <HI>Lithecolla,</HI> the same
as Masons use to join their broken Stones
together; or a Preparation of Wax and
Rosin.</P>
<P>That you be at the less trouble in prepa∣ring
your Skeleton for boiling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Method to be observed in boiling and separa∣ting the parts.</NOTE> you ought
to divide it in several parts, before you
put it into your Chaldron to boil, which
you must perform thus; first, Artificially
bare from the Muscles, the first and second
<HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck, on which the whole
Head turns, and separate them gently one
from another, so that the first <HI>Vertebra</HI> be
still fastned to the <HI>Cranium,</HI> then Saw off
<PB N="117" REF="67"/>
the upper part of the <HI>Cranium</HI> to take out
the Brain, and with a slender piece of
Wire a little hooked, strive to extract the
Ossicles of the Ears by the <HI>Foramen Audito∣rium,</HI>
which will be more easily extracted
after a little boiling of the <HI>Cranium,</HI> so
that by the use of the aforesaid Wire they
will come out; when they are extracted, keep
them by themselves till you have occasion
to use them. Secondly, separate the last
<HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Back from the first of the
Loins, and the Thighs from the <HI>Ossa Inno∣minata,</HI>
and the Arms from the <HI>Scapula</HI>'s,
so you have all most movable Parts sepa∣rated,
Thirdly, separate the Clavicle
from the <HI>Scapula,</HI> and also from where it's
join'd to the first Bone of the <HI>Sternon,</HI>
and put them by themselves, always ta∣king
Care by some mark to distinguish the
Right side from the Left. Fourthly, di∣vide
the Cartilages from the bony Extre∣mities
of the Ribs in their very Coalition;
then separate every Rib from the <HI>Vertebrae</HI>
of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> tying them one below ano∣ther
in order, in a piece of Packthread, to
distinguish them rightly, observing also
always the side they belong to; take Care
in separating them, they having a double
Insertion, as well with the Bodies of the
<HI>Vertebrae,</HI> as with their transverse Processes.
Fifthly, separate every <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the
Neck and Back one from another, hanging
<PB N="118" REF="68"/>
them in order on a small Cord, that you
be not at a loss in uniting them again when
boil'd also the <HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Loins in the
same order from the <HI>Os Sacrum;</HI> and di∣vide
the <HI>Ossa Coccygis</HI> from that, and the
<HI>Ossa Innominata</HI> from the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> so that
you may command, and cleanse each in or∣der
more commodiously. Sixthly, come to
the Limbs, beginning first with the Arms;
as for Example, separate the <HI>Os Humeri</HI>
from the <HI>Cubitus,</HI> and that from the <HI>Car∣pus,</HI>
which when you come to, take Care in
separating the Flesh and Tendons from
them, that you may keep them as much as
possible in their due places; for which end,
I think it will not be amiss to drill two or
three holes quite through each rank, in
which pass a Wire or two that will hold
them in their right Situation, in time of
boiling, they have in been before separated
from the Bones of the <HI>Metacarpus,</HI> which
four Bones you must also separate from each
Finger, making some fitting Marks with
Thread, or the like, which sustains one
Finger, and which another; and as for the
Fingers, put them in the Fingers of a
Glove, according to order; so there will
be less danger of Confusion; the Leg is to
be separated after the same manner as the
Arm, always making some distinguishing
Character, which belongs to the Right side,
and which to the Left.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="68"/>
Some Bones require a longer time of
boiling than others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sternon,</HI> will not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣mit of boil∣ing.</NOTE> and some will not en∣dure
boiling at all, as the <HI>Sternon,</HI> with
its annex'd Cartilages; the large Bones
admit of longer boiling than the small;
now suppose it be the Skeleton of a young
Subject, boil not above an Hour, or an Hour
and half at most, lest the Cartilaginous
tips of the Bones come away; but in an
Adult you may boil longer, the older the
Subject is, the longer time is required in
boiling; but before you put the long Bones
into your boiling Vessel, bore a hole in
their Extremities, large enough, according
to the bigness of the Bones, that the Me∣dullar
Parts may have free <HI>exit</HI> in boiling;
to further which, run up the Bones so
drill'd, a red hot Wire to and fro, to make
a quicker dispatch of the fatty Particles,
then cast them into your boiling Water;
for it's this fatty Substance only, which in
many Skeletons makes them look so muddy
and dull; when you think your Bones suffi∣ciently
boil'd, let them be presently taken
out and cleaned one after another, a fast
as you can; it's very good to rub the Bones
with Masons Dust, which fetches off the
<HI>Periostion,</HI> and levigates them very well;
or you may wash them in boiling Lye made
of Ashes, which scowers and cleanses them
very well; after they are thus cleansed,
throw them in clean cold Water, in which
<PB N="120" REF="69"/>
let them lye about half a Day, then take
them out, and wipe them dry, putting
them still in the same order as they were
before you boiled them, and observing to
make the same marks of distinction; when
they are thus dried, place them on the
Leads of he House for some Days and
Nights, especially when the Dews fall most,
but keep them from the violent heat of the
Sun, that being apt to make them brittle;
by this means they will become as white as
Ivory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sternon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ster∣non</HI> not to be boiled.</NOTE> as I have told you, is not
to be boil'd at all, by reason the Cartilages
will shrink, and go out of their true Fi∣gure,
so that you cannot bring the Cartila∣ges
to their true Shape, to be annex'd to
the ends of the Ribs from whence they
were separated, which will make your Ske∣leton
deform'd neither will it endure too
great a heat in drying, so that you must
use very great Caution in preparing it,
which you may do thus, After you have
Artificially and Neatly separated it, as I
have already taken notice of, cleanse it as
carefully from the Flesh as you can, then
let it dry moderately in the shade, always
striving to keep the Cartilages in their true
Figure, and now and then picking away
what you find of fleshy Particles; when you
think you have cleansed it well, rub it all
over, especially the Cartilages, with this
<PB N="121" REF="69"/>
mixture, made of Wax, Rosin, and Tur∣pentine,
used very warm, for so you will
hinder them from drying, and growing
brittle, which they would be apt to do
otherwise, and likewise defend them from
the Worm and Moth, as also from Cor∣ruption,
so keep it whole by you till you
have occasion to use it, in making up your
Skeleton.</P>
<P>When your Bones are thus clean'd and
dry'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Method of uniting your Skeleton.</NOTE>
then begin to unite your Bones to∣wards
forming your Skeleton. Since the
Spine is the prop of all, and the <HI>Os Sacrum</HI>
the <HI>Basis</HI> of that, you ought to begin with
it, as your Shipwrights do in making a
Ship, who always begin with the Keel, to
which they annex the other parts towards
compleating the Vessel; the Spine there∣fore
may well be call'd the Keel of Man's
Body, to which the rest of the Bones of
the Skeleton are join'd.</P>
<P>First, Therefore prepare a fitting Rod
of Steel, so order'd that it may have an
Elastic Property, that is, when you bend
it, to return to its first Figure of streight∣ness;
let it not be too thick, yet strong
enough to support all the <HI>Vertebrae;</HI> for by
this means you will have the Spine perform
all its motions. It must be a little more
than three Foot long, that it may pass
through all the <HI>Vertebrae,</HI> and come out of
<PB N="122" REF="70"/>
the top of the <HI>Cranium,</HI> to hang the whole
Skeleton on; it must be smaller towards
its top than bottom, by reason the Bones
of the <HI>Vertebra</HI> grow less towards the supe∣rior
part of the Spine; then Drill a hole in
the very Body of the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> through
which pass your Steel Wire, which you
must Artificially fasten at the lower end of
the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> to sustain all the rest, then
pass on the same Wire the rest of the five
Bones of the Loins, according to their or∣der,
holes being Drill'd through the very
Bodies of all the <HI>Vertebra</HI> in the very Cen∣tre,
that they may fit exactly each other;
in the same manner pass on the twelve <HI>Ver∣tebrae</HI>
of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> one by one, to which
join the Ribs likewise in order, beginning
with the lowest; this unition must be made
with Brass Wire, as well to the Bodies of
each <HI>Vertebra</HI> as transverse Processes, then
pass on the Steel Wire to the <HI>Vertebrae</HI> of
the Neck in their order, except the last,
which is call'd the <HI>Atlas,</HI> which must be
join'd to the Condiloid Processes of the
Occipital Bone, by two fitting Brass Wires,
so that the Head may have its due flexion
and extention; this being done pass the
Steel Rod through the Medullar <HI>Foramen</HI> of
the <HI>Atlas,</HI> into the very Capacity of the
<HI>Cranium,</HI> to pass through a hole Drill'd on
the top, that the Head and Spine may hang
regular, so the Head will have its Circular
<PB N="123" REF="70"/>
motion, as well as flexion and extention,
that being perform'd by the first and se∣cond
<HI>Vertebra</HI> of the Neck, as this by the
first only, being join'd by a double <HI>Arthro∣dia</HI>
to the <HI>Os Occipitis;</HI> when you have so
done, unite the lower Jaw by its Condiloid
Processes into the Glenoid Sinusses of the
<HI>Ossa Petrosa;</HI> then fasten the Teeth in
their proper <HI>Alveoli,</HI> with a preparation
of Rosin and Wax; then in its place hang
the <HI>Os Hyoides,</HI> also at the outward part of
the <HI>Foramina Auditoria</HI> hang the Officles
of the Ear in order; when you have done
this, fasten the <HI>Sternon</HI> and its Cartilages
to the Ribs, holes being Artificially Drill'd
through their Extremities, to fasten them
with Brass Wire; then fasten the <HI>Clavicu∣la</HI>
to the <HI>Sternon,</HI> to which unite the <HI>Sca∣pula,</HI>
which is not only to be fastned with
its <HI>Acromium</HI> to the <HI>Clavicula,</HI> but also to
the Body of the Ribs, to which its flat side
lyes on, then pass to the inferior part of
the Spine, and fasten strongly the <HI>Ossa In∣nominata</HI>
to the sides of the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> so
as to be join'd even before at the <HI>Ossa Pu∣bis,</HI>
which must be join'd together with
Wires, so the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> will be form'd, and
to the Extremity of the <HI>Os Sacrum,</HI> fasten
the <HI>Ossa Coccygis,</HI> and so you will have the
Trunk with the Head extraordinary well
fitted.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="71"/>
Then pass to the Limbs; first take the
<HI>Os Humeri,</HI> to whose lower Extremity u∣nite
the <HI>Vlna</HI> by two Hooks, one fitly a∣dapted
to receive the other, which Hooks
must be fastned one in the Extremity of
each Bone, so as the Bones sit close one to
another, for which end you may hollow a
little the Extremity of the <HI>Humerus</HI> with a
Graver, to make the Junctures the closer;
then to the side of the <HI>Ulna</HI> fasten the <HI>Ra∣dius,</HI>
so that it may have its Prone and Su∣pine
motion, which may be done thus,
Encompass its Neck pretty close with a
Ring of Brass Wire, (after the same man∣ner
as the <HI>Ligamentum Admirabile</HI> doth,
which comes from the <HI>Ulna</HI>) which you
must fasten in the lateral <HI>Sinus</HI> of the Head
of the <HI>Ulnae;</HI> then adapt fitly, and in their
due order, the Bones of the <HI>Carpus,</HI> and
they having but little, or very obscure
motion, you may only fasten them by their
sides with Brass Wire, holes being first
Drill'd through their very middle, also
fasten the first rank to the other according
to Art; when the <HI>Carpus</HI> is thus form'd,
unite the Bones of the <HI>Metacarp</HI> to them in
their due order; for which end, you must
have four little Brass Hooks, fitted close in
the Bones of the <HI>Carpus,</HI> to receive in order
four other little Hooks, one in each Bone
of the <HI>Metacarp,</HI> to be engaged in the four
first Hooks, fasten them so as the Bones
<PB N="125" REF="71"/>
may touch close, and yet at the same time,
the Juncture to have its proper motions;
also fasten the sides of the <HI>Metacarp</HI> one to
another with a piece of Brass Wire, yet so
as the proper distance be kept where it
ought; then fasten the first <HI>Phalanx</HI> of the
Bones of the Fingers to the <HI>Metacarpus,</HI>
then the second, and then the third, all in
their due place, which must be fastned
with fitting Hooks, as in the Bones of the
<HI>Metacarp</HI> with the <HI>Carpus;</HI> lastly, join the
<HI>Carpus</HI> to the <HI>Radius</HI> and <HI>Vlna,</HI> so that it may
have its proper motions: When you have
thus finished the whole Limb, then fasten
it to the Trunk, but so as you may take it
off when you please, which may be done by
only fastening a Hook on the very Head of
the <HI>Os Humerus,</HI> just where its Ligament
is, which is to be hung on a curved Brass
Wire, which must be fastned in the Cavi∣ty
of the <HI>Scapula;</HI> the lower Extremity
must be managed after the same manner,
observing fitting Circumstances, which
must be also made to take off and on, as oc∣casion
requires.</P>
<P>I only design'd this <HI>Appendix</HI> as a hint
towards the forming of a Skeleton, which
cannot be so well exprest by Writing, as
by often Working, and seeing it done.</P>
