<P>Perfection of knowledge the one, how im∣mers't
in swinish sloth and ignorance the
other; I am apt to wonder how it could
possibly be imagin'd that the same rationa∣lity
of Soul should inform alike, as we
are oblig'd to beleive by the authority of
Sacred Scriptures, and the Doctrine of the
Souls Immortality, the whole masse &amp; frame
of Human Nature, and not rather that
there should be a gradation of Notion from
the lowest brute up to the Angelic Region:
But that calling to mind the common maxim
of Philosophy, that the perfection of Soul is
the same in the Infant, as in the ripe of
age, only acting more or less vigorously, accor∣ding
to the capacity of the Organs; I thence
collect that there is also a different capacity
of the Organs, whence ariseth a different
Spirit and Constitution, or some interven∣ing
cause, by which it either acts or lies dor∣mant
even in Persons of the same age: the
first is that <HI>Melior Natura,</HI> which the Poet
speaks of, with which whoever is amply
indued, take that Man from his Infancy,
throw him into the Deserts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> there
let him converse some years with Tygers
and Leopards, and at last bring him where
civil society &amp; conversation abides, and ye
<PB REF="2"/>
shall see how on a sudden, the scales and
dross of his barbarity purging off by de∣grees,
he will start up a Prince or Legi∣slator,
or some such Illustrious Person; the
other is that noble thing call'd <HI>Education,</HI>
this is that Harp of <HI>Orphe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> that Lute
of <HI>Amphion,</HI> so elegantly figur'd by the
Poets to have wrought such Miracles among
irrational and insensible Creatures, which
raiseth beauty even out of deformity, or∣der
and regularity, out of Chaos and con∣fusion;
and which if throughly and rightly
prosecuted, would be able to civilize the
most savage natures, &amp; root out barbarism
and ignorance from off the face of the Earth▪
those who have either of these qualifications
singly, may justly be tearm'd <HI>Men;</HI> those
who have both united in a happy con∣junction
<HI>more</HI> than <HI>Men;</HI> those who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
neither of them in any competent measure,
certainly, in the conduct of their lives, <HI>less</HI>
then <HI>Men,</HI> and of this last sort is compos'd
that greatest part by far of <HI>our</HI> habitable
World, (for what the Nature and distin∣ction
is of the Inhabitants of other orb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to us utterly unkown though not any
where circumscrib'd, but diffused alike
through the 4 quarters) commonly call'd
<PB REF="3"/>
to <HI>Euripides</HI> for Tragedy, yet nevertheless
sleep inglorious in the croud of the forgotten
vulgar: and for as many of those Names
of Writers, whether more or less Eminent,
as have been preserv'd from utter oblivion,
together with an account for the most part
of what they writ, all Learned Men espe∣cially
such as are curious of antiquity are
oblig'd to those generous▪ Registers who have
been studious to keep alive the memories of
Famous Men, of whom it is at least some
satisfaction to understand that there were
once such Men or Writings in being:
However since their works having by what
ever casualty perisht, their Names, though
thus recorded, yet as being dispeirc't in se∣veral
Authors, and some of those not of the
most conspicuous note, are scarce known to
the generality, even of the Learned them∣selves,
and since of later Ages the memories
of many whose works have been once made
public; and in general esteem, have never∣theless
through tract of time, and the suc∣cession
of new Generations, fallen to decay
and dwindled almost to nothing; I judged
it a Work in some sort not unconducing to
a public benefit, and to many not ungrate∣full,
to muster up together in a body, though
<PB REF="3"/>
under their several Classes, as many of
those that have imploy'd their fancies
or inventions in all the several Arts and
Sciences, as I could either collect out of
the several Authors that have mention'd
them in part, or by any other ways could
come to the knowledge of, but finding this
too various and manifold a task to be ma∣nag'd
at once, I pitcht upon one Faculty
first, which, not more by chance than incli∣nation,
falls out to be that of the Poets, a
Science certainly of all others the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no∣ble
and exalted, and not unworthily tear∣med
<HI>Divine,</HI> since the heighth of Poetical
rapture hath ever been accounted little less
then <HI>Divine Inspiration:</HI> Pardon me
therefore most Honour'd <HI>Friends,</HI> if having
undertaken a Province more weighty and
difficult then the account of any other Art
and Science, and which beyond all others
exerciseth the utmost nicety and sagacity of
judgement, I ambitiously make address to
the Patronage of Persons of so fair a repu∣tation,
as well in Poetry as other parts of
Learning, and who are your selves partys
not obscurely or without just merit concern∣ed,
whom against what ever may happen
either of deserv'd or undeserv'd Censure,
<PB REF="4"/>
vouchsafe but the two first letters of their
Names, and these, it is to be supposed, desire
to be known onely to some Friends, that un∣derstand
the Interpretation of those letters,
or some curning Men in the Art of Divina∣tion;
now as to the last part of the objection,
I have so much the more confidence to stand
upon my own justification, by how much I
rely upon this Maxim, that it is less inju∣stice
to admit of 20 that deserve no notice
or mention, then to omit one that really de∣serves;
and here methinks there seems to
arise a large feild of examination and di∣stinction,
between those that are in truth
of no valew or desert, and those that are
generally reputed so; it is to be observed that
some have been once of great esteem, and
have afterwards grown out of date, others
have never arriv'd to any esteem, and possi∣bly
in both cases the merits of the cause may
have been various on either side; yet I am
apt to beleive that as it, is a more frequent
thing to over then undervalew, so a uni∣versal
contempt is a shrew'd, not infallible,
sign of a universal indesert; the reason is
plain, for though no doubt the number of
the judicious and knowing is as great if
not greater then ever, yet most confessedly
<PB REF="4"/>
not so great as that of the ignorant or only
superficially knowing, there are many that
think, few only that judge; therefore
things of the most transcendent excellence
are for the most part only valw'd by Per∣sons
of transcendent judgment, whereas
the indifferent and plausible are received
with general and vulgar applause. So
that those Works which being advanta∣geously
publisht, nevertheless obtain no
Fame, may be justly suspected of little or
no worth, since, had they been excellent,
they might falling into the hands of the few
that judge, have been vuoy'd up by their au∣thority,
had they been plausible, they would
h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e been cry'd up by the many that think.
And shall such very Ignore and contemptible
pretenders, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e allow'd a place among tht
most renowned of Poetic Writers, among
so many Loureated heads, with the tri∣umphant
wreath of <HI>Parnassus?</HI> I beg your
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avourable attentions, yours in the first place,
most oft equal Judges, yours in the next, most
Curteous <HI>Readers,</HI> let me plead a little
for the well meaners only, as something
Sympathising with those for whom I
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lead; Vertue will plead for it self, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds no Advocate; first let it consider'd
<PB REF="5"/>
time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some that had their Poetical excellen∣cies
if well examin'd, and chiefly among
the rest <HI>Chaucer,</HI> who through all the ne∣glect
of former<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ag'd Poets still keeps a name,
being by some few admir'd for his real
worth, to others not unpleasing for his fa∣cetious
way, which joyn'd with his old
<HI>English</HI> intertains them with a kind of
Drollery; however from Qu. <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
Reign the Language hath been not so unpo∣lisht
as to render the Poetry of that time
ungratefull, to such as at this day will take
the paines to examin it well: besides if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Poetry should Pleas but what is calculated
to every refinement of a Language, of how
ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consequence this would be for the future,
let him consider and make it his own case,
who being now in fair repute &amp; promising to
himself a lasting Fame, shall two or three
Ages hence, when the Language comes
to be double refin'd, understand (if Souls
have any intelligence after their departure
hence, what is done on Earth) that his
Works are become obsolete and thrown
aside. If then their Antiquated style be
no sufficient reason why the Poets of former
A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es should be rejected, much less the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e
of their antiquated mode or fashion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="5"/>
of Poetry, which whether it be altered
for the better or not, I cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook
upon it as a very pleasant humour, that
we should be so complyant with the <HI>French</HI>
custom as to follow set fashions; not only
in Garments, but also in Music, (where∣in
the <HI>Lydian</HI> mood is now most in request)
and Poetry: for Cloths I leave them to
the discretion of the Modish, whether of
our own or the <HI>French</HI> Nation; Breeches
and Doublet will not fall under a Meta∣physical
consideration, but in Arts and
Sciences, as well as in Moral Notions,
I shall not scruple to maintain that what
was <HI>verum &amp; bonum</HI> once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to be so always; now whether the Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nck-Hose
Fancy of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s days
or the Pantaloon Genius of ours be best;
I shall not be hasty to determin, not pre∣suming
to call in question the judgment of
the present Age, only thus much I must
needs see, that Custom &amp; Opinion ofttimes
take so deep a root, that Judgment hath
not free power to act. To the Antient
Greecs and Latins, the Modern Poet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
all Nations and for several Ages, have
acknowledged themselves beholding, for
those both Precepts and examples which
<PB REF="6"/>
have been thought conducing to the per∣fection
of Poetry; for the manner of its
Garb, and dress, which is Vers, we in
particular to the <HI>Italians,</HI> the first of the
Moderns that have been eminently Fa∣mous
in this Faculty, the Measure of the
Greec and Latin Verse being no way
suitable to the Modern Languages; &amp; truly
so far as I have observed the Italian
<HI>Stanza</HI> in Heroic Poem, and the Sonnet,
Canzon, and Madrigal in the Lyric,
as they have been formerly more frequently
made use of by the <HI>English</HI> than by any▪
so except their own proper Language they
become none better then ours, and there∣fore
having been used with so good suc∣cess,
I see no reason why they should be
utterly rejected; there is certainly a de∣cency
in one sort of Verse more then an∣other
which custom cannot really alter,
only by familiarity make it seem better;
how much more stately and Majestic in
Epic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Poems <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> especially of Heroic Argu∣ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<HI>Spencers</HI>'s <HI>Stanza</HI> (which I take
to be but an Improvement upon <HI>Tasso</HI>'s
<HI>Ottava Rima,</HI> or the <HI>Ottava Rima</HI> it
self, used by many of our once esteemed
Poets) is above the way either of Couplet
<PB REF="6"/>
or Alternation of four Verses only, I am
perswaded, were it revived, would soon
be acknowledg'd, and in like manner the
<HI>Italian</HI> Sonnet and Canzon; above <HI>Pin∣daric</HI>
Ode, which, whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the name
pretends, comes not so near in resem∣blance
to the Odes of <HI>Pindarus,</HI> as the
Canzon, which though it answers not so
exactly as to consist of <HI>Stroph, Antistroph</HI>
and <HI>Epod,</HI> yet the Verses, which in the first
<HI>Stroph</HI> of the Canzon were tied to no fixt
number, order or measure, nevertheless in
the following Srophs return in the same num∣ber,
order &amp; measure, as were observ'd in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir; whereas that which we call the <HI>Pindaric,</HI>
hath a nearer affinity with the <HI>Mono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro∣phic,</HI>
or <HI>Apolelymenon,</HI> used in the Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s
of <HI>Aeschylus</HI> his Tragedies: one thing more
is to be observ'd between the <HI>Italian</HI>
Verse and ours, namely that the Dissylia∣ble,
which in that Language is the only
way of Riming, is also in ours, very
applicable to Rime, and hath been very
much used formerly; I was going to say
with as much grace, sometimes, if not more,
then the Monosyllable; but that I am
loath to appear too singularly addicted to
that which is now so utterly exploded, espe∣cially
<PB REF="7"/>
since there are other things of much
greater consequence then the Verse; though
it cannot be deny'd, but that a Poeti∣cal
fancy is much seen in the choise of
Verse proper to the chosen subject, yet
however, let the fashion of the Vers be
what it will, according to the different
humour of the Writer, if the Style be
elegant and suitable, the Verse what∣ever
it is, may be the better dispenc't
with, and the truth is the use of Measure
alone without any Rime at all, would
give far more ample Scope and liberty,
both to Style and fancy then can possibly
be observed in Rime, as evidently appears
from an <HI>English</HI> Heroic Poem, which
came forth not many years ago, and from
the Style of <HI>Virgil, Horace, Ovid,</HI> and
others of the <HI>Latins,</HI> which is so pure
and proper, that it could not possiby have
been better in Prose: another thing yet
more considerable is conduct and design
in whatever kind of Poetry, whether the
<HI>Epic,</HI> the <HI>Dramatic,</HI> the <HI>Lyric,</HI> the
<HI>Elegiac,</HI> the <HI>Epanetic,</HI> the <HI>Bucolic,</HI> or
the <HI>Epigram;</HI> under one of which all
the whole▪ circuit of Poetic design, is one
way or other included; so that whoever
<PB REF="7"/>
should desire to introduce some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
Poem of different fashion, from any known
to the Antients, would do no more then he
that should study to bring a new Order
into <HI>Architecture,</HI> altogether differe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
both from the <HI>Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,
Tuscan</HI> and <HI>Composite. Epigram,</HI> is
as it were the fag end of <HI>Poetry,</HI> and
indeed consists rather of conceit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cu∣men
of Wit, then of Poetical inventions
yet it is more commendable to be a <HI>Mar∣tial</HI>
in <HI>Epigram</HI> then <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s <HI>Co∣drus</HI>
in <HI>Heroic Poetry.</HI> The <HI>Epaene∣tic,</HI>
comprehends the <HI>Hymn,</HI> the <HI>Epitha∣lamium,</HI>
the <HI>Genethliacon,</HI> or what
else tends to the praise or congratulation
of Divine, or on Earth Eminent Persones
the <HI>Bucolic,</HI> on <HI>Eclogue,</HI> pretends only
the familiar discourse of Sheapheards a∣bout
their Loves or such like concernments,
yet under that umbrage treats oft times
of higher matters thought convenient to be
spoken of rather mysteriously and obscu∣rely,
then in plain tearms: the <HI>Elegi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
seems, intended at first for complaint of
crosses in Love, or other calamitous acci∣dents,
but became applicable afterwards
to all manner of subjects and various oc∣casions:
<PB REF="8"/>
the <HI>Lyric</HI> consists of Songs or
Airs of Love, or other the most soft and
delightfull subject, in verse most apt for
Musical Composition, such as the <HI>Italian</HI>
Sonnet; but most especially Canzon and
Madrigal before mentioned, and the
<HI>English</HI> Ode heretofore much after the
same manner: the <HI>Dramatic</HI> comprehends
<HI>Satyr,</HI> and her two Daughters <HI>Tragedy</HI>
and <HI>Comedy:</HI> the <HI>Epic</HI> is of the largest
extent, and includes all that is narrative
either of things or Persons, the higst de∣gree
whereof is the <HI>Heroic,</HI> as <HI>Tragedy</HI> of
the <HI>Dramatic,</HI> both which consist in
the greatness of the <HI>Argument;</HI> and this
is that which makes up the perfection of
a <HI>Poet;</HI> in other <HI>Arguments</HI> a Man may
appear a good <HI>Poet,</HI> in the right manage∣ment
of this alone a great <HI>Poet;</HI> for if
Invention be the grand part of a <HI>Poet</HI>
or <HI>Maker,</HI> and Verse the least, then
certainly the more sublime the <HI>Argument,</HI>
the nobler the Invention, and by conse∣quence
the greater the <HI>Poet;</HI> and there∣fore
it is not a meer Historical relation,
spic't over with a little slight fiction, now
and then a personated vertue or vice ri∣sing
but of the ground, and uttering a
<PB REF="8"/>
speech, which makes a <HI>Heroic Poem</HI>
but it must be rather a brief obscure or
remote Tradition, but of some remarkable
piece of story, in which the <HI>Poet</HI> hath an
ample feild to inlarge by feigning of pro∣bable
circumstances, in which and in
proper Allegorie, Invention, the well ma∣nagement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whereof is indeed no other
then <HI>decorum,</HI> principally consisteth,
and wherein there is a kind of truth,
even in the midst of Fiction; for what
ever is pertinently said by way of <HI>Alle∣gorie</HI>
is Morally though not Historically
true, and Circumstances the more they
have of verisimility, the more they keep
up the reputation of the <HI>Poet,</HI> whose bui∣siness
it is to deliver feign'd things as
like to truth as may be, that is to say
not too much exceeding apprehension, or
the beleif of what is possible or likely,
or positively contradictory to the truth of
History. So that it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e absurd in
a <HI>Poet</HI> to set his Hero upon Romantic
actions (let his courage be what it will)
exceeding Human strength and power, as
to fight singly against whole Armies, and
come off unhurt, at least if a mortal Man,
and not a Deity or armed with Power
<PB REF="9"/>
Divine; in like manner to transgress so
far the compute of time as to bring toge∣ther
those that liv'd several Ages asunder;
as if <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> should be
brought to fight a single Duel with <HI>Ju∣lius
Caesar,</HI> would either argue a shame∣full
ignorance in Chronologie, or an irre∣gular
and boundless licence in Poetical fi∣ction,
which I reckon is allow'd the <HI>Poet</HI>
chiefly upon this consideration; because
being supposed as he ought, to understand
the ways of Heroic vertue &amp; Magnanim∣ty
from better principles then those of com∣mon
and implicite opinion, he hath the ad∣vantage
of representing, and setting forth
greater <HI>Idea</HI>'s, and more noble <HI>Examples</HI>
then probably can be drawn from known
<HI>History,</HI> and indeed there is no ingenious
or excellent quality either native or ac∣quired
wherewith he should not be fully
acquainted, no part of Learning in which
he ought not to be exactly instructed, since
as a curious piece of History painting, which
is the highest perfection in the Art of Pi∣cture,
is the result of several other Arts as
<HI>Perspective, Proportion,</HI> the knowledge
of <HI>History, Morality,</HI> the passions of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
mind, &amp;c. so Heroic Poesie ought to be the re∣sult
<PB REF="9"/>
of all that can be contrived of profit, de∣light
or ornament either from experience in
human affairs or from the knowledge of
all <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> it being but re∣quisite
that the same Work which sets

of such like Persons to a studious
delight in reading of those things, which
they are desired to imitate.</P>
<P>They likewise very much erre from
probability of circumstance who go about
to describe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntient things after a modern
Model, which is an untruth, even in
Poetry it self, and so against all <HI>Deco∣rum,</HI>
that it shows no otherwise th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
as if a Man should read the Antient
History of the <HI>Persians</HI> or <HI>Egyptians</HI> to
inform himself of the customs and▪ man∣ners
of the modern <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
besides that our Author should avoid, as
much as might be, the making such de∣scriptions
as should any way betray his
ignorance in antient customs or any o∣ther
knowledge, in which he ought indu∣striously
to shew himself accomplish't.</P>
<P>There is a also a <HI>Decorum</HI> to be ob∣serv'd
in the style of the H. Poem that
<PB REF="10"/>
is that it be not inflate or gingling with
an empty noise of Words, nor creepingly
low and insipid, but of a Majesty sui∣table
to the Grandeur of the subject, not
nice or ashamed of vulgarly unknown, or
unusual words, if either tearms of Art,
well chosen, or pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per to the occasion for
fear of frighting the Ladies from reading,
as if it were not more reasonable that La∣dies
who will read Heroic Poem should
be qualified accordingly, then that the
Poet should check his fancy for such ei∣ther
Men or Ladys whose capacities will
not ascend above <HI>Argalus</HI> and <HI>Parthe∣nia.</HI>
Next to the <HI>Heroic Poem,</HI> if not
as some think equal, is <HI>Tragedy,</HI> in con∣duct
very different, in heighth of Argu∣ment
alike as treating only of the Actions
and concernments of the most Illustrious
Persons, whereas <HI>Comedy</HI> sets before
us the humours, converse and designs of
the more ordinary sort of People: the
chief parts thereof are the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
by which latter is meant that moving and
Pathetical manner of expression, which
in some respect is to exceed the highest
that can be delivered in Heroic Poesie,
as being occasioned upon representing to
<PB REF="10"/>
the very life, the unbridled passions of
Love, Rage and Ambition, the violent
ends or down falls of great Princes, the
subversion of Kingdoms and Estates, or
what ever else can imagined of funest
or Tragical, all which will require a style
not ramping, but passionately sedate &amp; mo∣ving;
as for the <HI>Ethos,</HI> waving farther large
Discourses, as intending a Preface only,
not Poetical System, I shall only leave it
to consideration whether the use of the
<HI>Chorus,</HI> and the observation of the an∣cient
Law of Tragedy, particularly as
to limitation of time, would not rather
by reviving the pristine glory of the <HI>Tra∣gic
all,</HI> advance then diminish the
present, adding moreover this cau∣tion
that the same <HI>Indecorums</HI> are to
be avoided in <HI>Tragedy</HI> as have al∣ready
been intimated in Heroic Poem,
besides one incident to <HI>Tragedy</HI> alone,
as namely that <HI>Linsie-woolsie▪</HI> in∣termixture
of <HI>Comic</HI> mirth with Tra∣gic
seriousness, which being so frequently
in use, no wonder if the name of Play
be apply'd without distinction as well
to <HI>Tragedy</HI> as <HI>Comedy;</HI> and for the
Verse if it must needs be Rime, I am
<PB REF="11"/>
clearly of opinion that way of Versifying;
which bears the name of <HI>Pindaric,</HI> and
which hath no necessity of being divided into
<HI>Strophs</HI> or <HI>Stanzas</HI> would be much more
suitable for <HI>Tragedy</HI> then the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Rhapsodie</HI> of Riming Couplets, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
whoever shall mark it well, will finds it
appear too stiff, and of too much constraint
for the liberty of conversation▪ and the
interlocution of several Persons: and now
before conclude, I cannot but call to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
something that may be yet alledged againt
some very noted Writers either Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,

the like, here mentioned, who for what
they are said to have written in Poetry,
being perhaps but small or inconsiderable,
will scarce be thought worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plaid a∣mong
the <HI>Poets;</HI> It is true indeed, they
do not shine here as in their proper <HI>Sphear</HI>
of <HI>Fame,</HI> nevertheless since it is not un∣grateful
to many to know all that hath
been written by famous Men▪ as well in
the Arts they least, as those they most
profess, and since the Register of one
Science only may well take the greater
Scope within that circuit, I judged it
not impertinent to mention as well those
<PB REF="11"/>
Famous Men in other Faculties, who
have also writ Poetically, as the most
Famous of Poetical Writers, considering
especially how largely the Name of <HI>Poet</HI>
is generally taken; for if it were once
brought to a strict Scrutinie, who are the
right, genuie and true born <HI>Poets,</HI> I
fear me our number would fall short, and
there are many that have a Fame deser∣vedly
for what they have writ, even
in Poetry it self, who if they came to
the rest, I question how well they would
endure to hold open their <HI>Eagle</HI> eys a∣gainst
the Sun: Wit, Ingenuity, and
Learning in Verse, even Elegancy it
self, though that comes neerest, are one
thing, true Native <HI>Poetry</HI> is another;
in which there is a certain Air and Spi∣rit;
which perhaps the most Learned and
judicious in other Arts do not perfectly
apprehend, much less is it attainable by
any Study or Industry; nay though all
the Laws of <HI>Heroic Poem,</HI> all the Laws
of <HI>Tragedy</HI> were exactly observed, yet
still this <HI>tour entrejeant,</HI> this Poetic <HI>E∣nergie,</HI>
if I may so call it, would be
required to give life to all the rest,
which shines through the roughest most
<PB REF="12"/>
unpolish't and antiquated Language, and
may happly be wanting, in the most po∣lite
and reformed: let us observe <HI>Spencer,</HI>
with all his Rustie, obsolete words, with
all his rough-hewn clowterly Verses; yet
take him throughout, and we shall find in
him a gracefull and Poetic Majesty: in
like manner <HI>Shakespear,</HI> in spight of all
his unfiled expressions, his rambling and
indigested Fancys, the laughter of the
<HI>Critical,</HI> yet must be confess't a <HI>Poet</HI>
above many that go beyond him in Li∣terature
some degrees. All this while
it would be very unreasonable that those
who have but attempted well, much m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re
those who have been learned, judicious
or Ingenuous in Verse should be forgot∣ten
and left out of the circuit of <HI>Poets,</HI>
in the larger acceptation.</P>
<P>Thus, most <HI>Worthy Arbiters,</HI> I have
layd before you the reason and occasion
of this design, have Apologized for what
I judg'd most obnoxious to Censure or
Objection; have lastly, deliver'd my own
sentiment in some things relating to Poe∣try,
wherein, if I have differ'd ought
from the received opinion, I can safely aver,
that I have not done it out of affecta∣tion
<PB REF="12"/>
of singularity, but from a different
apprehension, which a strict inquiry into
the truth of things (for there is also a
Right and a Wrong, a Best and a Worst,
as well in Poetical as other Assertions▪)
hath suggested to my reason, perswading
my self, that no right judgement can be
given, or distinction made in the Writings
of This or That Author, in whatevor Art
or Science; but, without taking ought
upon trust, by an unbiass'd, and, from the
knowledge of ancient Authors; judicious
examination of each; being also sufficiently
assur'd of the concurrence with me in this
matter, of all impartial Readers; of yours
especially, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most honoured Friends, whom
I wish that fate which I am concern'd in
for all deserving Writers, a lasting Fame,
equal to the merit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what you have so ad∣vantagiously
publisht to the World.</P>
