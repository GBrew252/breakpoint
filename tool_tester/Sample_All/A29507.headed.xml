<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THat which the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> once affirmed before <HI>Salomon,</HI> is very true; <HI>The Instruments</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 10. 9.</NOTE> <HI>of Gods blessings are the arguments of his love:</HI> whence it is apparent that God did wonderfully declare his tender love to the Church upon earth, in con∣tinually raising famous men, who like burning lights in golden Candlestickes, did shine forth to the honour and glory of his Sanctuary. And as no age (since the Apostles time) hath been so glorious for the light of truth, and the abundance of lights as the present, so I hope (without pre∣judice to any) our <HI>Brightman</HI> of blessed memory, for names sake, may deservedly finde a place a∣mong those that were most famous in this kinde; for truely whilst he lived he was, as Christ said of <HI>Iohn Baptist, A burning and a shining light.</HI> He was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3. 33</NOTE> famous in Preaching, and for his conversation making himself an example to the Church, by practising what he Preached, living according to the rule of his Doctrine. Yea and that which is wonderfull, this light of ours being extinct,
<PB REF="3"/>
still shines brightly, for what else is his <HI>Apocalyps</HI> of the <HI>Apocalyps,</HI> but a <HI>Light shining in darke places?</HI> for surely so mysterious is that parcell of Scrip∣ture, that it is not to be interpreted by wit, but by the Spirit of Divination. But our <HI>Bright∣man</HI> hath made such plaine interpretation there∣of, that thou mayest easily behold the great my∣stery of Iniquity of the Beast of <HI>Rome,</HI> as also Gods great mercy in calling the Jewes. And al∣though many learned men have (to their glory) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent their whole time in the interpreting this part of Scripture; yet this our Author hath in∣terpreted this and other most difficult places; witnesse the Song of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the latter part of the Prophecie of <HI>Daniel.</HI> Concerning the Song of <HI>Solomon,</HI> the Law of the Jewes is very well knowne by which young men under the age of thirty (before which time they did not enter into the Priest-hood) were interdicted to reade it, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t those things which were mystically set forth, should by the swaying of their passions, be enterpreted in the worst sense. But our <HI>Brightman</HI> amongst others that have deserved well in this also▪ expresses every word spiri∣tually, whereby thou mayest receive Divine and heavenly pleasures. All things are expounded with great labour, and applyed with great
<PB REF="3"/>
Judgement; insomuch, that in this new path, you may walk in the foote-steps of the Spouse, Jesu Christ: or as the Jewes call it, enter the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum.</HI></P>
<P>The manner of his handling this Scripture, especially in the application, is universall; for he held this prophecie to be wonderfully difficult, whence it is no marvell, if some doubt whether he did attain to the genuine interpretation of the Song: but since the diffiulty of the Allegory hath occasioned such variance amongst the Interpre∣ters, that it may almost be said; as many men, so many mindes: I hope it will not be distastefull to the Church of Christ, that the labours of this her godly sonne are published in Print, whereby the Reader may perceive the Authors great know∣ledge in this mysterie: hee doth acknowledge a marriage beween Christ and his Church; but in this he differs from the rest of the Interpreters, that what they conclude to be always, he restrains to certain times. I confesse, he that for sakes the an∣cient opinions of learned and godly men, and pro∣pounds to himself a new way, in which he wal∣keth all alone, may (in good manners) be thought to erre; but because sometimes he that readeth understandeth that, which the Prophets them∣selves which Prophesied it did not know, and be∣cause
<PB REF="4"/>
our <HI>Brightman,</HI> for his singular meeknesse, humility, and godlinesse, was thought by them amongst whom he lived and had to do, to be free from all manner of affectation of Noveltie; as al∣so because he is not singular in his manner of in∣terpreting: for amongst the <HI>Hebre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, Aben Ezr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> conceives the mysterie from <HI>Abraham</HI> to the Mes∣sias, to be here set forth; And some amongst us from the Messias to the Churches freedome un∣der <HI>Constantine:</HI> And in this they all agree, that some things are particularly to be applied. And lastly, because our Author doth not desire credence in any thing, but where it may be grounded upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 21. 1 Cor. 14. 33.</NOTE> a sure foundation, therefore <HI>feare not, try all things, and hold fast that which is good; The spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>But admit this Propheticall and particular ap∣plication doth not please you; yet to behold the whole condition of the Church from the time of <HI>David,</HI> till time shall be no more; and this set forth in a short and easie table, cannot choose but be both profitable and delightfull unto thee.</P>
<P>Reader, I thought good to premise these things for thy sake, and for the Authors praise; (at which I chiefly aim) much more might be spoken, but read the Author, who in the Explication of the first verse, doth by way of Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, admirably
<PB REF="4"/>
set forth the authority, excellency and use of this Song of Songs.</P>
<P>By the way, I pray take this caution, if you once enter the Portall, come not back untill you have surveyed the whole building, the curiosity of whose structure, surpasses my expression.</P>
<P>Let God so shine upon us with the light of his Countenance, that there may alwayes be a <HI>Bright∣man</HI> in Britaine, to the setting forth of the glory of God in his Sonne Jesus Christ: Farewell.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Vers. 1.</HI> Let him kisse me with the kisses of his mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, for thy love is better then wine.</HEAD>
<P>THis Prophesie following agreeth well neere in all things with that of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> in the <HI>Revelation.</HI> They fore-shew the same events in the like times. And either of them directeth his course to the same marke. They differ so much in beginnings as <HI>Salomon</HI> ex∣ceeded <HI>John</HI> in age. They also follow somewhat, a divers manner of handling it. <HI>John</HI> setteth forth the strifes and battells of the Church more at large, and exactly painteth out her enemies with a greater caution or heed taking. But this Propheticall Paranymph (or marriage maker) toucheth these things more sparingly, desirous onely to set forth the joyfull events of the Church, he scarcely men∣tioneth at all any accidents, whereby this nuptiall song might be disturbed: or at least so seasoning her troubles, that much pleasure may alwayes appeare in them.</P>
<P>But first let us weigh the words, then let us see the Application: Kisses are sometimes taken for saire, milde, and pleasant words, as chidings and brawlings are compared to wounds, as <HI>Salomon</HI> saith, <HI>Prov.</HI> 27. 6. <HI>The wounds of a lover are more faithfull then the flatte∣ring kisses of an enemie.</HI> The Church then desireth to be instructed
<PB N="982" REF="7"/>
with the words of her Bridegroome, which she calleth Kisses, as the most assured pledges of the Bridegroomes love; neither can any thing be compared with this love; therefore she preferreth it be∣fore wine, which is chiefely esteemed among those things which taste most pleasantly: for the comparisons of this song are taken from such things which do chiefely tickle up the sences: because our infirmity is such, that we commonly feele no greater pleasure in this life, then in those things which pertaine to these inferior sences. This is the sum: the company of the faithfull doe chiefely desire to be altogether over-whelmed in a most familiar conversation with Christ, and to be most plentifully instructed with the words of his mouth: which they confirme to be the great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st pleasure that can be. Now for the Application. <HI>Solomon</HI> beginneth from the Church of his time, and sheweth the face of it as it was in the Raigne of his Father <HI>David,</HI> in this and the next verse. Christ then by the mouth of <HI>David</HI> (bearing his Type) kissed the Church, instructing it with most sweete <HI>Odes, Psalmes</HI> and <HI>Songs,</HI> wherein that time was most excellent above all others. <HI>David</HI> is called the sweete singer of <HI>Israel</HI> by the Testimony of the Spirit, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 1. Whereof the booke of <HI>Psalmes</HI> is a plentifull witnesse. <HI>Solomon</HI> also compo∣sed 1005. songs, but very few of them are recorded in the Sacred Treasury.</P>
<P>The Prophets, which were many then▪ and at other times, did chide very often; but not kisse: They reproved sins, they thundred out Judgements, they terrified with threatnings: whereas this sweet singer of <HI>Israel,</HI> powred out almost nothing but prayers, thanks∣givings, promises and Exhortations: worthily were these the times of kissing and imbracing▪ chiefly, if ye adde all that care and diligence, which hee applied to ordaine the worship of God most fitly, 1. <HI>Chro.</HI> 23. &amp;c. With these kisses, which even burned with love of the divine word and of all pietie, the people had then no lesse desire to be imbraced (if ever at any time.) <HI>David</HI> rejoyced, when they said unto him, <HI>Let us go into the house of the Lord.</HI> And seeing the readinesse of the people, preferring the wor∣ship of God before all Wine, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122. 1. The King himself like∣wise in the sweetnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of singing (a figure of the Bridegroom,) with diligence and desire of Religion, (one of the company of the faith∣full) did not he desire one thing of the Lord, <HI>that he might dvvell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of his life? Psal.</HI> 27. 4. He mani∣festly confirmeth the Law of the mouth of God, to be betteer to

into his Chambers: we will reioyce and be glad in thee: we will re∣member thy love more then wine: the righteous do love thee.</HEAD>
<P>In this one little verse, <HI>Solomon</HI> intreateth of the Church during his raigne, whose whole condition is divided into sixe members.</P>
<P>First, the King drawing by his example, and the spirit working to∣gether in the faithfull. The first authority of his raigne began with the published meeting at <HI>Gibeon,</HI> 2. <HI>Chro.</HI> 1. 2. Of what force was this attraction? There followed most calme peace, such abundance of wealth as no where the like: wisedome almost more then mor∣tall. Glory which amazed all other Kings: and (which exceeded all) a beholding next unto God. These were enough to have drawn the most unwilling. But the people followed willingly: <HI>We will run</HI> (say they) <HI>after thee.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly here is taught, that the people drawn by the Kings ex∣ample, do flie with a swift course: He commanded the meeting at <HI>Gibeon:</HI> they flocked thither in great troopes, 1 <HI>Chro.</HI> 1. 13.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the chamber, whereinto the Bride is brought: was that most magnificent Temple built by <HI>Solomon.</HI> This house is the inner chamber; nay rather the couch and Bed (as it is afterward called) wherein the Bridegroom converseth with the Bride most familiar∣ly: whither <HI>Solomon</HI> brought the Church, when for her sake he built and adorned it so beautifully; and especially by drawing the people into the Temple, on the day wherein he dedicated the house, going before them with sacrifices, prayer and thanksgiving, as 1. <HI>Kings</HI> 8. through the whole chapter.</P>
<P>Fourthly and fiftly is declared, how joyfull all the people were of those things, so happily begun and continued for many yeers.</P>
<P>Lastly he saith, <HI>the upright love thee.</HI> But why doth he mention the upright, as though there were any in those times whose hearts were not sincere and sound? verily he seemeth by these words to passe over privily those blessed times to a sorrowfull falling away. We know how grievously <HI>Solomon</HI> fell in the last yeers of his reigne, by bringing in strange wives, 1. <HI>King.</HI> 11. His heart was not found towards the Lord, but he followed <HI>Ashtaroth</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcom,</HI> and built an high place for <HI>Chemosh</HI> and <HI>Molech.</HI> But did not many of his flattering courtiers run before, whither they saw the King ready to decline? But the faithfull and upright in heart, remained firm in the truth, howsoever destitute of the Kings authority. Here then we may behold the beginning and middle of his raigne very plea∣sant.

In this verse is a speciall description of the two Tribes, as there is of the other, and in the two verses following▪ In this verse in the first words, he preventeth the contempt which might be objected▪ and then sheweth the causes of her calamitie. <HI>Look not upon me</HI> (saith she) that is to say, behold me not disdainfully; which words do not only command but also foretell in what e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>timation she should be a∣mong her own people. The causes are three; first the principall: <HI>bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use the Sun hath looked upon me,</HI> that is, heaven hath inflicted this calamity on me, as God hath threatned it before, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11. 11. 30. &amp; 31.

For in the fifth yeer of the reign of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> when they had a little breathed after their former troubles, <HI>Shishak</HI> the king of Egypt made war upon them, having twelve hundred Chariots, and a very great Hoste. He took many fenced Cities, and had proceeded to the utter wasting of the Land, had not the Lord at the length pitied them, and turned away the rage of his wrath from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> so that he would not utterly destroy it, but only bring it in bondage to the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> As he saith by the Prophet <HI>Shemaiah,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. 8, 9. <HI>Neverthelesse, they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the Kingdomes of the countries.</HI> This <HI>Shishak</HI> entring into the City, took away the treasures of the House of the Lord, and the treasures of the Kings house: he carried away also the shields of Gold which <HI>Salomon</HI> had made.

<P>How coherent is this praise? which aswell instructeth the minde in knowledge, as it endueth the heart with Religion. It is one thing for us to be thankfull to Christ, and another thing for Christ to be thankfull to us. He accounts us thankfull by reason of election, we feel not him sweet and pleasant, before we be called to the know∣ledge of the truth: and our hearts be kindled with a desire of god∣linesse. But if any godly one desire to know the state of the Church after the death of <HI>Hezekias,</HI> the Bride declareth it in commendations of the Bridegroom. She then flourisheth, when she may freely be∣hold and set forth the beauty of her beloved, which verily hapned in the time of <HI>Iosias,</HI> in whose excellent sanctity the Church saw the sweetnesse of her beloved, 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 34. <HI>and</HI> 35. At sixteene yeers of age he began to seek the God of his father <HI>David,</HI> four yeers after, to cleer <HI>Inda and Ierusalem</HI> from the high places and the groves: and from carved and molten images, 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 34. 3. Religion adorneth every age but especially that tender age aswell for the present and unexpected ripenes of it, as for a greater hope therof in time to come.</P>
<P>But the latter part of the verse, declareth more fully the History of <HI>Manasses &amp; Ammon. Also our bed is green.</HI> The Kings chamber (before) signified the Temple. Neither is it to be doubted but (Bed) is here used for the same, which is wont to be placed in the more inward and privy Chamber, where the godly may injoy Christ most familiar∣ly. This Bed waxeth green like the meadowes, in the beginning of the spring, whose beautie the winter had defaced, if they had al∣wayes kept their greennesse, it had been unnecessary to make men∣tion of it. And if <HI>Iosias</HI> had succeeded next after <HI>Hezekias,</HI> it had been as superfluous to make mention of the Temples flourishing, as of green grasse in summer. The words then declare aswell that winter which miserably afflicted the Church under <HI>Manasses and Ammon,</HI> which shook off altogether the flowers of godlinesse, and exposed Christs Bed to all injuries and tempestuous stormes, 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 33. As also the pleasantnesse of a milder time, under <HI>Iosias,</HI> who
<PB N="993" REF="12"/>
beautifully repaired the winters spoiles. And the event very well an∣swered the prophesie, for the purity of Religion was the first care of <HI>Iosias,</HI> when he was yet a childe: but after in the eighteenth yeer of his reigne he applied his minde to re-edifie the house of God, desirous to leave the Bed green, which he had found grievously rent and torne with stormes and tempest, 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 34. &amp;c.</P>

Worthily was it now foretold that the beames should be of cedar, when the building was set forward with such cost, care and diligence, whereby the first beauty of it might in some sort appear, though perhaps it could not fully be restored.

Those times which followed the restoring of the Temple by <HI>Iosias,</HI> do teach us that this complaint was just.

That the Church should certainly be preserved safe and sound, remaining in the midst∣of her Enemies, and that shee should bee no lesse defended by her very enemies, then flowers are wont to be among the thornes, who beset them about with pricking branches.

<P>These words more plainly shew that the house of wine was no banqueting house, but a cellar wherein wines are laid up. For the lover is not wont to languish with desire, where plenty of the thing loved is present: and such is that banquet where the Master of the Feast is absent. The Bride therefore fainteth, because she findeth not her beloved present in this wine-cellar, (for in adversity God is said to be absent from us) so that she had need to be upholden of her fellowes, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st she should f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll for want of strength, wherein was most elegantly d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clared, what d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire the Church should have to∣w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds God during the captivity, and by what means she should be satisfied untill the full restitution.

The Flagons noted the prophets and priests, full of sweet and wholsome doctrine: whereof there should be some, which only like Flagons should yeeld the wine of heavenly knowledge to the people, when plenty of hogsheads could not be had in exile and such adversity. God bestowed the commodity of both in the cap∣rivity, for he wonderfully exalted <HI>Daniel, Hananiah, Mishae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Hazaria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who like wholsome apple trees, shadowed the afflicted Church with their boughes, and fed and refreshed the miserable people with pleasant fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it.

These things then belong to that desolation which <HI>Antiochus Epi∣phanes</HI> brought upon them, who robbed the Temple, forbad Sacri∣fices, offered Swines flesh in the Temple, constrained them to wor∣ship strange gods, compelled them to leave circumcising their chil∣dren, burned their holy Bookes, and left no manner of wickednesse unattempted.

The <HI>mount Lebanon</HI> reaching many miles, set full of ce∣dars and other sweet smelling trees, yeelded such a strong fragrant smell, that no ill favour whatsoever could take away the sweet per∣fume thereof.

<P>This description is according to the proprieties which are wont to be seen in a pleasant Garden or Orchard. First well senced, and after set with choice trees, then watered plentifully with sweete water, fourthly placed in a fresh ayre, and lastly, fruitfull and pro∣fitable. In the former verse we have the fencing: Now behold the planting which consists of two sorts of Trees: some for fruit, some only for pleasure. The one plainly shewed in the first words, <HI>an Orchard of Pome-granates,</HI> the other in the words following, <HI>with pleasant fruits.</HI> As there are two sorts of Trees: so are there two orders of the Members in the Church, one publike, the other private.

The pleasant fruits are the Christian Congregations, ready to obey their Governours, which though they are not to be compared to the fruit Trees, yet by reason of their obedience and consent, they much adorne this Orch∣ard.

Riches, Honour, Immunities, magnificent buildings, of Temples, and the like were meere delights, like an Orchard set with <HI>Pomegra∣nate</HI> plants.

<P>The first member of this verse seemeth to be the words of the Bridegroome: for the Lord of the <HI>Garden</HI> speaketh, saying, <HI>Blow upon my Garden:</HI> But the <HI>Bride</HI> is the Garden her self, and not the Mistresse of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: for inviting him into the Garden, she truly and modefi∣ly confesseth it to be his, not hers▪ <HI>Let my beloved</HI> (saith he) <HI>come i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to his Garden,</HI> &amp;c.

watering. Neither doth the Bridegroome intreat that a supply should be made from any but himself of that which should be fit for the garden; but to shew what ayre the Garden should use at those times. By the <HI>North</HI> and the <HI>South▪</HI> are meant <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> who stoutly defended the truth in those times, against the <HI>Arrian</HI> heresie. Lastly, of the fruit whereunto he is invited: for it is no idle invitati∣on, only for f sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons sake, but for gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t use, to expresse the condition of those times. <HI>Let my love</HI> (saith she) <HI>come into his Garden, and eat his pleasant fruit;</HI> which words, no doubt, are of the Spouse, giving the Garden to her beloved, not challenging it to her self, as is said before: for without doubt, she perceived that her beloved had withdrawne himself, otherwise, had the invitation been in vain. There was an ex∣cellent outward shew, but within, all things were defiled with Mosse and Rust; Envie, Brawlings, Contentions Ambition and Heresies, had almost abol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed true pietie: so that the Church necessarily (leaving the multitude, who preferred a bare name only) lurked, as it were, in darknesse, with a few Citizens. This solitarinesse happened when the fountain was sealed, as is said at the 12. <HI>verse:</HI> for then many more were within the bounds of the Church, then had leave to drink of the Fountain. Then was the Dragon thrust out of heaven, and the woman fled into the Desart, as we have shewed in the <HI>Revelation.</HI> The mean∣ing is, the Church much flourishing outwardly, Christ left her▪ vold of true piety, as more plainly will appear by his answer in the next <HI>verse.</HI></P>

So that whatsoever the godly Emperor gave for the comelinesse and commodity of the Church, they changed all to her shame and destruction. It is most pleasant to consider how expresly the Holy Ghost long before painted out these things, which at length should happen in the Church, the like whereof we see still continueth. And hitherto of the Church inclining to fall, it ceased to flourish, when the Bridegroome first departed the garden, and as soone as <HI>Constantine</HI> came to the Empire: As long as hee lived she was in great glory, but presently after followed the darknesse.</P>

<P>Having spoken compendiously of the Church restored; some things are now briefly propounded, particularly in these two verses, wherein he divideth the severall Congregations into three ranks, according to their degrees of purity: namely, <HI>Queens, Concubines,</HI> and <HI>Virgins</HI> or <HI>Maids;</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he that comes neerest to truth and holinesse, the Bridegroome holdeth her dearest; wherefore the <HI>Queens</HI> are mighty, and flourishing Churches, which excell the rest in purity. The <HI>Concubines</HI> are of a lower ranke; they are admitted to the Bed, but far from the honour and excellency of the lawfull wives; having no dower themselves, nor are their children to in∣herite. The <HI>Virgins</HI> are in the lowest place, as servants and hand∣maids, altogether estranged from any familiar acquaintance, they

have imployment in the house, they have victuals and clothing; they are reckoned to be of their Masters houshold, but are not partakers of his goods; they labour not for themselves, but for their Masters.

This distraction into such different degrees hapned about the yeere, 1563.

first of the sisters is the Church of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> whose calling is to be expected within these few ages. After, the seat of <HI>Antichrist</HI> (the City of <HI>Rome)</HI> shall be utterly destroyed, which is to be very short∣ly. Hither all circumstances leade, wherewith the <HI>Revelation</HI> agreeth, and many Prophecies of the old Prophets. This calling shall be do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble: the first, from hence to the eighth verse of the seventh Chapter: The second in the rest. The condition of the first is in part▪ briefly delivered in this verse, and after severally in the verses fol∣lowing. The generall explication teacheth what kinde of beginning and progresse there shall be for certain yeeres. The first con∣version shall be like the morning; The first growing age, <HI>faire a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Moone:</HI> The stronger age, <HI>cleer as the Sunne:</HI> The full strength thereof, <HI>terrible, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Army with Banners.</HI> It is likened to the morning, because it shall not only be of a doubtfull and obscure light▪ (as is the first break of the day) but also, because the first light there∣of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all appeare from the East▪ for <HI>Daniel</HI> (speaking of this first calling) saith, <HI>Rumors out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast, and out of the North, shall troubl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him,</HI> Chap. 11. 44. as more plainly (God willing) shall be said at that place. In which words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e joyneth the North to the East, because the <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wes</HI> there banished, should gather together with those of the East to the same faith of Christ. In the <HI>Revelation, Euphrates is dried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, that a way may be made for the Kings of the East,</HI> Chap. 16. 12. After, when <HI>the new Ierusalem shall descend from heaven, the first gate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ull be Eastward,</HI> Chap. 21. 13. If you desire the time of this first co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>version: God hath very much concealed the moments of time from us; yet I suppose it is certainly noted out in the Scripture. And the day drawing neer, will adde a cleerer light unto it, <HI>Dan.</HI> 12. 4, &amp;c. But as neer as we can attain to it by conjectures, (and those not light, as they seem to me) it is to be expected about the yeer 1650▪ as at the twelfth of <HI>Daniel</HI> the eleventh and twelfth verses shall be said more plainly. Such shall be the beginning of this new light; the progresse shall equall the beauty of the Moon, most cleerly enlightening the mighty darknesse, with a swift increase after the first appearing, shining in a few dayes, like the full Moon: as <HI>Esay</HI> cryeth out, <HI>Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be borne at once? for as soon as Sion travelled, she brought forth her children,</HI> Chap. 66. 8. The riper age shall strive with the Sunne, in glory, light, and cleernesse; the exceeding brightnesse shall be such▪ that it cannot be looked upon; yea, it shall be▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t length terrible

to the enemies, no lesse then an Army <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rnished with Banners. We may observe out of these comparisons, how much more excellent the condition of this Church shall be, then ever it was of any other. Great was the dignity of the former, but at the most declared by si∣milit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des taken from the earth; but here, as if the excellency of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arthly things were not sufficient to set forth such glory, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies upward towards heaven, taking <HI>the Morning, the Moon, and Sunne</HI> for comparisons: <HI>Come Lord Iesu,</HI> let us quickly see that pleasant sight, the gathering together of our dispersed brethren, that all flesh may acknowledge thee the only Lord; that thy unmeasu∣rable faith and mercy which exceedeth all the straits of a created minde, may be celebrated and renouned in the mouthes of all men.</P>

He there∣fore admireth the beauty of her feete, because it was verily a thing full of admiration. A shooe is applyed in the Scriptures to three sig∣nifications. To <HI>Mirth, Speed,</HI> and <HI>Liberty.</HI> It was a signe of Mirth; from whence in mourning they either put them off, of their own ac∣cord.

Or they were constrained against their wils as Captives to the victors, who led them naked and barefoote, <HI>Esa.</HI> 20. 4. Speede hath somewhat a more plain efficacy, for he that is shod, treadeth more boldly, and feareth not pibbles or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hornes. Where∣fore God when he assured a speedy returne to his people, he pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iseth to bring it to passe, that they shall goe with shooes on their feete, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a.</HI> 11, 15.

Iewels are fitted into many turning Circles, whose artificiall tur∣nings doe excellently set forth this wonderfull conversion or tur∣ning of the thighes and feete.

Most vehement love requires the like againe. The ardent desire of love is exprest by most fit similitudes, for saying it is as strong as death, she sheweth thereby that none can resist the power thereof, death overcommeth the proudest ones by force, so that it should be folly to contend with her.

Now seeing the Church of the Iewes shall begin to flourish about 400. yeers after that Resurrection, 600. yeers at least shall be left wherein she shall raign here upon the earth▪ but how▪long after, he only knoweth, who knoweth all things. I can light upon no mark or token of time that may give even the least conjecture; <HI>Daniel</HI> saith, after the destruction of the Turkish Empire, (which shall be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stroyed by Conversion of the Iewes) a space shall be given for the rest of the Beasts to live, <HI>even for a time, and a time appointed.</HI> But this space is neither expressed, neither perhaps shall the end of the World be joyned with the destruction of the remnant. That there∣fore which hath troubled many, as if that certain limiting of time which offereth it self in the Revelation and elsewhere, should bring us to the end of all (repressing or mollifying the words of Christ, <HI>Mar.</HI> 13. 32. by interpretation) may hence be delivered from this fear, for all those accounts end, either in the Iewes Conversion, or if they goe a little farther (whereof I finde only two, which I have spoken of before) they rather shew within what time the end shall not be, then at what moment it is to be expected. Wherefore that of Christ remaineth without doubt, in the same meaning as the words do properly shew: <HI>The Angells themselves know not the very</HI> last day. We verily believe this day by faith, and have many tokens of its drawing neere, but I suppose we fail of any account that may bring us to any neere knowledge thereof. If any think I have

opened a window to security by removing the bounds of it so far off: let him know if the shortnesse of this life and the end uncertain move him not, neither will the neerenesse of this day move him any whit at all. What matter makes it whether Christ himself come to judgement in the sight of all men, or thou be drawne to judgement at his Tribunall Seate? or oughtest thou not be carefull of thine own end, unlesse the end of the whole world do accompany it? <HI>Let the wicked be filthy still,</HI> yet this thought will easily shake off s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curity from the godly, though this revealed truth may not a little bridle the tongues of the wicked, which draw all things into doubt, whiles they read of fixed termes in some mens workes, and by use learn them to be deceived by conjecture. As if the errour of blinde man (and such verily are the sharpest sighted in Divine Matters) should be a sufficient Argument to subvert the truth of God. We may be deceived in obscure things, and not plainly delivered to us of purpose, yet the Divine Truth doth neither deceive, nor is deceived, as they too late shall finde, which have despised it.

<HEAD>The Popes SPECTACLES Or his <HI>CLJMACTERJCALL</HI> yeere calculated in <HI>August, Anno</HI> 1623.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Riefe Notes out of severall Expositors of the <HI>Revela∣tion,</HI> touching the rising and fall, progresse and finall destruction of the Enemies of the Church: with some other observances out of divers writers.</P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> wrote his <HI>Revelation</HI> and sent it to the seven Churches in <HI>Asia minor,</HI> now called <HI>Natolia.</HI></P>
<P>He wrote it <HI>Anno</HI> 97. as <HI>Eusebius</HI> saith: in 99. as <HI>Irenaeus</HI> saith. He dyed under <HI>Trajan,</HI> 109. as most say; But <HI>Ierome</HI> and <HI>Nicephorus</HI> say in 100.</P>
<P>This Prophesie is of things to come, and not of things past, as is well observed by Master <HI>Brightman.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed, for the better understanding of this Prophe∣sie, what names and Titles the <HI>Revelation</HI> giveth to the adversaries of the Church, which are as followeth.</P>
<P>The first and last adversaries are called a dragon; an open and perverse enemie to Christianity, which were the heathen Emperors, and now the Turkes, as the best expositors understand it.</P>
<P>The second and third after the Dragon are two beasts, the first out of the Sea, the second out of the earth.</P>
<P>The fourth is called a Whore and <HI>Babylon, chap.</HI> 17. 1. and 5. Al∣so that Whore is called the great City, &amp;c. which in Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> time was onely <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="1080" REF="56"/>
The Dragon the first Adversary was destroyed by <HI>Constantine</HI> the great in overthrowing <HI>Dioclesian, Maxentius</HI> and <HI>Maximinian Anno</HI> 311. he began his Raigne <HI>Anno</HI> 306. or 307.</P>
<P>After the overthrow of the Dragon, a Beast ariseth presently out of the Sea: which <HI>Brightman</HI> expounds erroneous doctrine, so like∣wise hath he Ecclesiasticall Government. And in <HI>Constantines</HI> time <HI>Rome</HI> was called the first Sea, <HI>Constantinople</HI> the second, <HI>Alexandria</HI> the third, <HI>Antioch</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the fifth. And so the <HI>Romanists</HI> at this day style the Popes jurisdiction.</P>
<P>The other beast riseth out of the Earth, which is the Popes spiri∣tuall and Temporall power, or rather his deare friends, the Anti∣christian Emperours; because it is said verse 11. that this beast ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th all that dwell in the earth to worship the first Beast, which is the Pope, for they were his first builders and are his chiefe pillars, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He is likewise called the Beast which was and is not, <HI>Chap.</HI> 17. 11. by which is meant the <HI>Romane</HI> Empire, in the West, which lay voide three hundred twenty five yeeres, from <HI>Augustulus,</HI> to <HI>Carolus Magnus.</HI></P>
<P>Also, the Beast was taken, and with him that false Prophet which wrought miracles, &amp;c. <HI>Chap.</HI> 19. 20. which seeme to make them to be two distinct persons.</P>
<P>Thus also is <HI>Rome</HI> plainely described to be set on seven hills and ruling over the Kings of the earth: which make <HI>Bellarmine</HI> and <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bira</HI> both <HI>Iesuites</HI> to confesse that <HI>Rome</HI> is the Whore there meant. <HI>Rome</HI> also maintaines Idolatrie and Superstition in her Religion, Go∣vernment, and Policie; which in Scripture is called Whoredome: then the Pope is not the Whore, but one of the Beasts or Bawds rather (if you will) to the Whore. For example; he maintaines Stewes in <HI>Rome,</HI> yeelding him yeerely 40000. Duckets, and recei∣veth yeerely of Curtizans 50000. Duckets, and granteth dispensa∣tions to his Cardinals to use <HI>Sodometry</HI> in the three hot moneths of the yeere. I would know of any Iesuite whether the Pope can pardon a sinne before it be committed &amp;c. As he did <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nry</HI> the 8. to marry his brothers wife: the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> his Neece: the Arch-dutches, <HI>Albertus,</HI> whom she might call, Brother, Uncle, and Cozen. And so I leave it to the indifferent to judge, whether he be the Whore, the Beast, or a Bawd.</P>
<P>The Whore is said to sit upon a Beast, <HI>Revel.</HI> 17. the Pope is this whores only stay and prop, <HI>(quis nescit?)</HI> And so <HI>Iunius Napier</HI> and
<PB N="1081" REF="56"/>
<HI>Brightman</HI> take it: but <HI>Downam</HI> thinks it meant of the Germane Emperours, whose punishment and destruction is described, <HI>Chap.</HI> 17. <HI>and</HI> 18. <HI>vers.</HI> 3. <HI>and</HI> 4.</P>
<P>In the thirteenth chapter it is said that the first beast is wounded and healed by a Dragon, before the arising of the second Beast; which Dragon some say was <HI>Athaulphus</HI> that wounded <HI>Honorius</HI> the Emperour, Ann. 414. Others say <HI>Odoacer,</HI> who overthrew <HI>Augustulus</HI> the last Romane <HI>Caesar.</HI> Another (viz. D. <HI>Forbes, now a Bishop in Scot∣land)</HI> saith, it was <HI>Theodoricus</HI> the <HI>Ostrogoth,</HI> Ann. 476. Others <HI>Alaricus a Goth</HI> that sackt <HI>Rome,</HI> Anno 541. These were all heathen Kings, and therefore accounted among the Dragons, whereof one healed the first Beast, viz. the <HI>Pope.</HI> Quere.</P>
<P>After this <HI>Rome</HI> was under the Exarches of <HI>Ravenna</HI> 197. yeers, which were Christians; then under the <HI>Lumbards</HI> 56. yeers, which at first were heathen and after <HI>Arrians,</HI> and had but a part of the Empire.</P>
<P>In this time the <HI>Visigothes</HI> ruled in Spaine, the <HI>Aleins</HI> in <HI>Guines</HI> and <HI>Gascoine,</HI> the French men in the residue of France, the <HI>Vandalls in Africke,</HI> the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xons in Britain,</HI> the <HI>Ostrogoths</HI> in <HI>Mise</HI> and <HI>Hungarie,</HI> the <HI>Herules and Turinges</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>talie</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> Only the name of the Empire remained with <HI>Zeno</HI> in the East. <HI>Transa∣mundus</HI> King of the <HI>Vandalls</HI> in <HI>Africke</HI> banished 220. Bishops Ann. 459. About the time was great alteration of States and King∣domes; <HI>Carolus magnus</HI> overthrowing the <HI>Gothes and Vandalls</HI> with <HI>Alaricus</HI> and the <HI>Lumbards,</HI> was by Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> made Emperour of the West, Anno 802. <HI>(M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lancthon and Lanq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et)</HI></P>
<P>So from <HI>Augustulus</HI> to <HI>Carolus Magnus</HI> the Empire was void, 325. yeers, wherein saith <HI>Eraesmus, Antichrist</HI> was to arise. <HI>Downam, Napier and Brightman,</HI> say he rose when <HI>Constantine</HI> removed the Empire (out of the way) to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> It is true, then the whore conceived the monster, but she bore him in her womb 35. yeers, before she brought him forth to the fight of the world, 2. Thess. 2.</P>
<P>He that withheld was taken away by <HI>Constantine,</HI> (311) when he overthrew <HI>Dioclesian, Maxentius, and Maximinian</HI> the last of those Dragons: neither is he there said presently to appear or be borne into the world, <HI>Chap.</HI> 13. 11. <HI>and</HI> 12.</P>
<P>The second Beast after his rising, causeth the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed. These were the Emperours: as <HI>Phocus,</HI> who gave the first title
<PB N="1082" REF="57"/>
of universall-Bishop to <HI>Boniface</HI> the third, <HI>Bale</HI> saith, he was a Britain first named <HI>Wenefridus,</HI> Anno. 606. <HI>Pepin</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the great, who gave great revenews to <HI>Leo</HI> the third. But these were of the Race of the second Beast▪ and not of the Dragon. About 100 yeers after the death of <HI>Charles</HI> the Roman Empire came to <HI>Otho</HI> the first German Emperor, Ann. 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. After in 996. the Eel ctors of the Empire were ordained, by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the seventeenth and <HI>Otho</HI> the third.</P>
<P>Neither were <HI>Boniface</HI> or <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the first Beast as some take it, for the two Beasts were bred and born long before, as hereafter will plainly appear.</P>
<P>Thus much shall suffice to distinguish between the Dragon, the Beast, the false prophet, and the whore, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 2.</P>
<P>The Dragon called also the devill and Satan is bound for 1000. yeers▪ his first binding by <HI>Constantine</HI> continued untill <HI>Zadok</HI> the first Emperour of the Turks: which was 1310. This dragon began to breed, Anno 1051. but was not of full growth untill <HI>Ottaman</HI> the first Emperour, Anno 1300. Then the Dragon and Satan compassed the tents of the Saints and the beloved city, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. who were the Christians. In this time the Christians recovered <HI>again Ierusalem,</HI> and held it 92. yeers, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 3.</P>
<P>The two witnesses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and their corpes lying in the streets of the great city unburied three dayes and a half, is expounded by <HI>Brightman</HI> to be the decree of the Councell of Trent, the Pope and <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, dated the eight of April 1546. Calling the scrip∣tures a dead letter, as Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> had before decreed. And so the scriptures were but as a dead corpes, for the space of three yeers and a half, <HI>(Sleydan)</HI> untill the coming of <HI>Mauritius,</HI> and the men of <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> who made the said councell to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ie the ninth of No∣vember 1549. This councell continued by fits 17 or 18 yeers. The Emperour with the consent of his brother <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and the Princes of Germany suffered the Scriptures again to be read in their mother tongue by a decree at <HI>Ausburg</HI> the seventh of October 1555. when the two witnesses were set again upon thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feet, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 13. And then the tenth part of the city is said to fall, which was <HI>Eng∣land, Denmark, Swetia</HI> and a great part of <HI>Germany</HI> fell then a∣way from the Romish Religion or sea.</P>
<P><HI>Napier</HI> takes it to be meant of the councell of <HI>Constance,</HI> which began Anno 1414.</P>
<P>These two witnesses are to prophesie 1260 dayes clothed in sack∣cloth, which are so many yeers, and then they are to be slain.
<PB N="1083" REF="57"/>
Wherefore they must not begin at <HI>Constantines</HI> time, as <HI>Napier</HI> and <HI>Brightman</HI> suppose, but a little after his death at the Councell of <HI>Ariminum:</HI> where above 200. good Bishops opposed the multi∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de of the <HI>Arrians.

About which time was the losse and fall of those two famous Churches of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and the Palatinate: or if you will, the great afflictions that fell on the two Churches of France and Germany, which caused a great rejoycing among Papists in all places. But if I might see them upon their feet again either in Anno 1624 or 25. I shall be confident it was meant of them.</P>
<P><HI>Parker</HI> who wrote upon the crosse, and died at Frankford, saith (by learned <HI>Brightmans</HI> leave) that by the Angel powring out his viall on the sun▪ is meant some great affliction to fall upon some Church.

<P>The time, times and half a time, must agree with the sixth verse of the twelfth chapter, where the woman is fed in the desart 1260. dayes, which make three yeers and a half.</P>
<P>Also they say it was the custome of the Prophets to account yeers by moneths, weeks and dayes, as <HI>Num.</HI> 14 34. <HI>Eze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI> 4. 5▪ 6.

<P>A time, times and half a time is expounded three yeers and a half. Three yeers and a half contain 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. moneths, which make 1260▪ d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies; thirty dayes to a moneth.</P>

<P>But I crave leave of these two worthies to begin 35. yeers after theirs, my reasons are; Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, they take the man▪childe to be <HI>Con∣stantine,</HI> and so do I, but it is plain in the text that he is first taken up to God before the womans flying into the wildernesse, which came not to passe untill 23. or 26. yeers after the death of <HI>Constantine.</HI> Secondly, in his time the Church most flourished and had no cause to hide; But <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unty and leaving <HI>Rome</HI> to the Popes go∣vernment was the cause that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esently <HI>Rome</HI> grew proud and turned to be the great whor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or (committing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ornication with errou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ambition) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he conceived and brought forth two sons that wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Beasts: yi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <HI>Constanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Emperours and <HI>Liberi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Pope both <HI>Arri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</HI> These are the fathers and Grandsires of the two Breasts▪ viz. of all the Antichristian Emperour and Popes following.

<P>The greatest difficulty is to know the time when the womans flying began: to free my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from envy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avill of Papists and Prot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣stants I will begi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> councells. And I will begin my computation at the horrible dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee and councell of <HI>Antioch,</HI> Anno 365. And add to it 1260 yeers, the time of the womans hiding i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the wildernesse (and the Beasts time of Domineering) it makes 1625. At the end whereof I hope the woman or Church sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll come forth as a virgine and Bride trim▪d for her husband, and see all her enemies trod under foot: which I pray God the father of all mer∣cies and the God of all comfort to grant, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="1085" REF="58"/>
But I know many will say, my calculation is incredible, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsidering the Popes and the Emperours late prevailings, together with their and the King of Spaines power. I answer: The whores plagues are to come upon her at a day, <HI>Chap.</HI> 17. which may well be unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stood of a yeers warning, or upon a suddain.</P>
<P>Also if <HI>Babylon</HI> be and were an Antitype of <HI>Rome,</HI> as it is apparent; <HI>Babylon</HI> was of an incredible strength and greatnesse.

The same night the city was taken destroyed: and so may the Pope for any thing I know.</P>
<P>And if any ask, by whom it shall come to passe. It is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 17. that there are ten horns, which are ten Kings, who shall hate the whore and make her desolate. If any demand who these ten Kings are, let them reade <HI>Maxwells</HI> Iury of 24.

Whence shall a horrible, bloody and most sharp battell arise, wherewith all <HI>Europe</HI> (being grievously shaken) shall tremble: and being sundry waies rent and wasted, it shall be obnoxious to notable mutations and changes.
