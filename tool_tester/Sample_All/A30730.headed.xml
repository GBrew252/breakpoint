<LIST>
<ITEM><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Transition from the First to the Second Part, <HI>Page</HI> 1, 2, 3</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Of the Seventh-Day p.</HI> 3, 4</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Q.</HI> Whether the Seventh-day, which is the last Day in every Week, in the weekly Revolutions, and orderly Re∣turns thereof, have been from the Be∣ginning, and so continued to be all the Old Testament-administration of Grace thorow, and be so under the New Testa∣ment dispensation of Grace, all along to this Age of the Church, and will be so to the End of the World, the weekly Sabbath day? 4</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Answer at large given to this Inquiry, is in the Affirmative; that it is so; from 4 <HI>to</HI> 149</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ʋnder this Answer are divers particular useful Truths and Duties opened; As that the Seventh-day was Created for to be the weekly Sabbath, the last day of the week, being that Seventh, and no other day of the week so. Thus it was in the Primitive Creation, 4, 5, 6, 7</ITEM>
<ITEM>Which matter is resolved into a Scripture Determination, 4, 5, 6, 7</ITEM>
<ITEM>That all the Reasons which <HI>Jehovah Ae∣lohim</HI> doth give for the due Observa∣tion of a weekly Sabbath, do belong to to the Seventh, which is the last day in every week, and to no other day of the week, as such, 7, 8, 9, 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Aelohim</HI> rested from his Works of the foregoing six days of the week, on the Se∣venth day, as the weekly Sabbath-day. Which Seventh day Sabbath righte∣ousness in Christ, is that Righteousness which a Believer is to apply himself to cover his Sabbath-unrighteous∣ness, 7, 8</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Aelohim</HI> Blessed the Seventh, which is the last day in the week that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath day 8, 9</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Aelohim</HI> sanctified the Seventh, which is the last day in the week, that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, 9, 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>That all the Scriptures thorow, where the Holy Spirit doth speak of a weekly Sabbath-day, there the name and thing of a weekly Sabbath, is given only to the Seventh, which is the last
<PB REF="3"/>
day in the week, in the weekly Revo∣lutions, and successive Courses of it, and to no other day of the week, as a weekly Sabbath-day, <HI>Page</HI> 10, 11</ITEM>
<ITEM>That no Command is given for the obser∣vation of any other day in the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, but only of the Seventh, which is the last day in the week, in the weekly returns of it, 11 <HI>to</HI> 15</ITEM>
<ITEM>Where is, also further discovered, that pretended unwritten Institutions, for a First-day weekly Sabbath, are a false, deceitful, wrong, cooked rule, which we may neither measure nor walk by, 12, 13</ITEM>
<ITEM>That Christ as Mediator, had it not in Commission from his Father, to change the weekly Sabbath-day, from the Se∣venth to the First, 13, 14, 15</ITEM>
<ITEM>That there is no Promise made to the ob∣serving of any other day in the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, but only of the Seventh-day, which is the last day in the week, in the weekly returns of it, 15, 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>That there is no threatning, all the Scri∣ptures thorow, either denounced against, or executed upon, any that shall not observe any other day in the week, as a weekly Sabbath-day, but only against and upon such as will not observe the Seventh-day, which is the last day in every week, 16 <HI>to</HI> 19</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Aelohim</HI> bath put this weekly Se∣venth-day Sabbath into Created Na∣ture, by a standing unchangeable Law, 19, 20, 21, 22</ITEM>
<ITEM>Here is declared what is meant by Na∣ture in Scripture 20, 21, 22</ITEM>
<ITEM>Where also, seeing it is called for by some as an argument to men, is disoovered, That this particular Seventh-day, which we now count to be the last day of the week, is the Seventh-day, by the Judgement and Tradition of such Hi∣storical Records, as many are so fond of; although we do bottom our judg∣ment and practice upon Scripture Re∣velation, and created Nature, 22, 23, 24, 25</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objections against this Seventh-day Sab∣bath, are answered, from: 25 <HI>to</HI> 147</ITEM>
<ITEM>Here is proved, that it was not a seventh part of weekly time, or a seventh day, But the Seventh-day, the last day in every week, this, and this only is the weekly Sabbath-day, having a special honour put upon it by <HI>Aelohim</HI> himself by notes of Demonstration, by particles, by pronouns, by praepositions, all signifi∣cant in their places, to point out the Seventh-day, to be the only certain, known, determinate, fixed, particular, unchangeable day of the weekly Sab∣bath: where the emphatickness of the Hebrew, <HI>Ha,</HI> is asserted, 25 <HI>to</HI> 33</ITEM>
<ITEM>It is further evidenced, that what is in the English Transsation, in seven places of the New Testament, the first day of the week, is in every one of them in the Greek, one of the Sabbaths, in pro∣priety of speech, and so its colourable pretence for a First day weekly Sab∣bath, is convincingly reprehended, as Scriptureless; from 33 <HI>to</HI> 45</ITEM>
<ITEM>That five of these seven places mentioned in the four <HI>Evangelists,</HI> relate to the Paschal Sabbaths, and not to the week∣ly Sabbath, 33 <HI>to</HI> 41</ITEM>
<ITEM>That Believers in the times of Christ, and of his Apostles, before the New Testa∣ment was written, could find nothing in all their Scriptures of the Old Te∣stament for a pretended First day Sab∣bath, 32, 33</ITEM>
<ITEM>That in one place, where it is, <HI>The first of the Sabbath,</HI> this speaks nothing to any change of the weekly Sabbath, from the Seventh to the First day, but has a quite another meaning, both in the significancy, and in the intendment of that phrase, 35, 36. 37, 38</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the weekly Sabbath under the New Testament, is not barely, or no more than an half-holy-day, between Sun rising and Sun set, but that it is an whole Seventh-day from Evening to Evening, 38</ITEM>
<ITEM>That Christ's Redemption Work, as well as his Creation Work, has established the Seventh-day, to be still the weekly Sabbath day, 39, 40</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 7. is no firm ground to bottom the pretended First day Sab∣bath upon, 41, 42, 43</ITEM>
<ITEM>Neither is 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16. 2. 43, 44</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the eleven Disciples did not meet on Christs Resurrection Day, as a new∣weekly Sabbath day, in memory of that Rising, 45</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the weekly Sabbath, under the new Dispensation, is not left so much in the dark and deep, as some pretend; but is clearly the Seventh-day in the plain Precept, as of old, 46, 47</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the true stating of the Matter of right in this Question, about the
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
weekly Sabbath, doth not depend upon Ecclesiastical History, <HI>Page 47 to p.</HI> 62</ITEM>
<ITEM>That mens cause of erring, of their great erring about this Controversie (as in many other weighty Cases:) is, be∣cause they know not the Scriptures, nor the Power of God, put forth in a word-way, 48</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the cause of mens erring, is not therefore, because they do not know and acknowledge, and own, either the Ma∣gistral dictates of Humane Rabbies, 48</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or the Ancient Records of Ʋncanonical Church-Histories, and Traditions of men, 48, 49,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or the Councils of the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> and the sayings of the ancient Fathers, 49, 50</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or unwritten verities, to be as Scripture Supplements, to be received by the people from their Leaders, upon trust without tryal, 50</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or the judgement, opinion and practice of of those who are reputed the Learned and the Godly in the present Age, 50</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or the Natio-al Establishments in the matters of Doctrine and of Worship, in their humanely invented, and imposed confessions of Faith and stinted Leitur∣gies, 50, 51</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or man-invented-Arts and Sciences of Philosophical Knowledges, and of uni∣versity humane Learning, 51, 52</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or the innate, or acquired powers of mens own rational Intellect and Will, 52</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or Natural Experiments, and fleshy sen∣sations, 52, 53</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or the unscriptural Impulses of Specula∣tive Enthusiasts, 53</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or the doubtful questioning of unsettled Scepticks, 54, 55</ITEM>
<ITEM>That our Faith is not to be resolved into the Authority of fallible men, but into the infallible veracity of the truthful <HI>Aelohim, 54 to</HI> 62</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the Old Testament Types and Figures did contain New Testament Instituti∣ons, as to particular Churches, Seals of the Covenant, Presbyters, Deacons, Diaconesses, 58, 59, 60</ITEM>
<ITEM>That <HI>Revel.</HI> 1. 10. Doth not prove any change of the weekly Sabbath, from the Seventh to the First day of the week, 62 <HI>to</HI> 65</ITEM>
<ITEM>Neither doth <HI>Psalm</HI> 118. 22-26. 65, 66, 67</ITEM>
<ITEM>Neither doth <HI>Act 2. 1, 2, &amp;c.</HI> 67</ITEM>
<ITEM>Nor <HI>Ezek.</HI> 43, 25, 26, 27. 68</ITEM>
<ITEM>Nor <HI>Heb. 4. 9, 10, 68 to</HI> 145</ITEM>
<ITEM>Here the plain meaning and scope of this passage in the Epislle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> is given 68. 69, 70</ITEM>
<ITEM>Here is further shewn, that the Day ex∣pressed in the ninety fifth <HI>Psalm,</HI> and referred unto by the Author of the E∣pistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> is not to be under∣stood of the First day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, 70, 71, 72</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the rest spoken of in this, is not meant of the Weekly Sabbath Rest, 72, 73, 74 <HI>to</HI> 77</ITEM>
<ITEM>Where is opened the significancy of the Word, Sabbatism in the Graek, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towed from Hebrew Origination, as many other Greek words are, 74 <HI>to</HI> 77</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the, He, mentioned in one passage of this part of this Epistle, is meant of the Believer, 75, 76, 77</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the parallel between Workers, Works and Rest, doth not hold in some things; and where in it doth hold, is discovered, 77, 78, 79, 80</ITEM>
<ITEM>Here is shewn, what are the works which Believers do rest from, when they enter into this Sabbatism, 79, 80</ITEM>
<ITEM>The force of the conjunction, <HI>For,</HI> is shewn, 80, 81</ITEM>
<ITEM>As also, what the import of the change of of the number, from the plural to the singular, is 81, 82</ITEM>
<ITEM>And how this Rest, is both God's Rest, and the Believers Rest too, 82, 83</ITEM>
<ITEM>Here is further manifested, that it is a mistake, to go about to found a pre∣tended First day Sabbath upon the New Creation, as if it precisely began on the Day of Christ's Resurrection, 83 <HI>to</HI> 145</ITEM>
<ITEM>It is Premised, that it is a choice Privi∣ledge, and a special Liberty, which Be∣lievers do injoy under the New Testa∣ment Administration of Grace, 84, 85</ITEM>
<ITEM>Where also, some objections that do wrest <HI>Galat.</HI> 4. 9, 10. and <HI>Colos.</HI> 2. 8, 16, 17. are answered, 85, 86, 87</ITEM>
<ITEM>And that the LORD Jesus Christ was Administrator under the Old, as well as New Testament Dispensation of Grace, 87, 88</ITEM>
<ITEM>The particulars are here instanced in, <HI>What the old things are which pass away, and what the things are which do become new, 88, 89 to</HI> 92</ITEM>
<ITEM>The renewing of the Covenant in the lat∣ter days, is spoken to, 92. 93</ITEM>
<ITEM>That there was a Covenant of Grace under the Old Testament Administration, is
<PB REF="4"/>
asserted and evidenced from the Scri∣ptures, <HI>Page 93 to pag.</HI> 101</ITEM>
<ITEM>And that the whole of the Christian Religion, for Doctrines, Graces, Duties, Priviledges, and such like parts of that Religion, is one and the same, under both the Old and New Testament, 101 <HI>to</HI> 108</ITEM>
<ITEM>And in what sense the Seventh-day Sabbath is some ways a sign of this, 108 <HI>to</HI> 116</ITEM>
<ITEM>The new Worship was Typically signified in the Figuring pattern of the Old. This is also demonstrated, 116 <HI>to</HI> 120</ITEM>
<ITEM>And that the Law of Faith was a Law under the Old Testament Dispensation, 120 <HI>to</HI> 123</ITEM>
<ITEM>And that it is an errour to affirm, that the Decalogue has less in it than the Law of Nature: At also, that therefore, it was never intended for a mere or per∣fect Transcript of the Law of Nature, 123</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ʋnder this is discovered, That to this De∣calogue it doth belong, to believe that the Soul is, 124</ITEM>
<ITEM>And to love our selves with a just and necessary Love, 124, 125</ITEM>
<ITEM>And to take greatest care to save our souls above our bodies, 125</ITEM>
<ITEM>And to tame and mortifie all our fleshly lusts, in order to our Salvation, 125, 126</ITEM>
<ITEM>And to deny all bodily pleasure, profits, honour, liberty and life, for the securing of our Salvation, 126</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Old Law of the Ten Words is proved in the Word of Truth, to be still the same both to Jew and Gentile. It was the Rule of Obedience to them under the Old Testament, as unto God in Christ; and is still so a Rule unto us, un∣der the new. Difference of Horizons, and of Climates makes no change of the Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, 126 <HI>to</HI> 147</ITEM>

<HEAD>A TRANSITION FROM THE FIRST to the SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this inquiringly-spirited Age, wherein there are such high Pretendings, and costly attempts, and industrious diligen∣ces used to me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orate Philosophy by experimental Disquisi∣tions; putting other kinds of Learning upon some natural Advance, that. <HI>Arts</HI> may be more <HI>artful,</HI> and <HI>Sciences</HI> may be more <HI>Scientifick;</HI> there is the louder Call given forth to the ingenious Professors of the Christian Religion to be up∣on a spiritual improve of those excelling Knowledges of this Art of Arts, and Science of Sciences, which has treasured up in it the most, both mysterious secrets, deep skills, and useful discoveries: Are other Talents traded withal, and shall this be napkin'd up? Give me a man, who has attained to an eminent degree, and is still continuedly reaching after, and pressing towards, larger measures of practical skilfulness how to live over believed Truths, how to improve Scripture-Convictions, how to fill up Christian Duties, how to act sancti∣fying Graces, how to mortifie Corruptions, how to overcome Temptations, how to exercise spiritual Senses, how to bear crosses, how to enjoy priviledges, how to carry on, and to order all the affairs of his particular lawful Calling in a Scripture-way for Kind, for Principles, for Rule, and for Ends, how to grow up into the later∣day-Glory, how to walk with God, how to have distinct fellowship with the Fa∣ther, as the Father; with his Son Jesus Christ, the Mediator, as such; with the Holy Spirit, as the Holy Spirit; in their several Offices and Relations: how to pass into such a mystical membership as may be an Heaven upon earth, how to manifest and evidence an universal-growing holy-Conformity, both in knowledg and in o∣bedience to an whole Christ, and to the whole Word of Christ; in short, how to be really a thorow Disciple of the LORD Jesus, daily perfecting his Christiani∣ty; bring me such a one, and he shall be the wise man with me, whilst the vain af∣fecters of humane wisdom may not expect to be advanced to such a degree in this religious School of Christian Learning. In the First Part of my endeavours to promote Scripture-knowledges, I went over the Journal or Diary of the first crea∣ted week so far as to the end of the sixth day, culling out some few particular choice instances of <HI>Aelohims</HI> works in each of those six foregoing days of that week, redu∣cing
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
them to their true, proper, pure, primitive, created nature, or being, according to Scripture-Revelation, as an exemplary Specimen or proving tryal for the due ad∣vancement of Word-learning by the most approved and best-fitted means, thereby to discover and to correct several errours in Paganish Philosophy, to reprove and to reform the lazy negligence and superficial knowledg of some, to quicken and ex∣cite the industry of others, and to facilitate and direct their studying, that, they may no longer deter themselves from deeper researches into the incomparably best sci∣ence by any appearing difficulties. Having thus my self had a spiritual view of the created World through a Scripture-glass: put it into the hands of the discerning Reader for him a while, to delight his eye with the clear prospect of so beauteous an Object, that might a while withdraw, and feast my thoughts with sweet medita∣tions upon <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and upon his word, and his works. See, and admire, O my Soul, what a glorious structure the wonder-working Creator hath set before thine eyes of Sense, of Reason and of Faith! If thou ascend into the higher Heaven <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Revel. 17. 14. and 19. 16. Psal. 48. 2. Esa. 14. 13, 14, 15. Acts 7. 55, 56. Job 26. 6, 7, 9. and 37. 9, 22. Esai. 6. 1. and 66. 1, 2.</NOTE>, there above the lower visible world maist thou take a pleasant view of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> Christ in his human glorified Nature, <HI>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</HI> sitting on the glorious Throne of his exalted Majesty, at the right hand of his Father, negotiating all the weighty affairs of such, more especially, whom the Father hath given unto him! There he continually presenteth himself and the All-sufficiency and full satisfactoriness of his sacrifice and oblation, and the purchases of his passi∣on, and the merits of his death! There he appears in a Court both of Justice and Mercy, as an Advocate before the face of God making intercession for thee, that, all procured benefits may be made effectual for thee! In that highest world, there mayst thou see, thousand times thousands ministring before the LORD, and ten thousand times ten thousands of glorious Angels standing before Him, these with the Spirits of just men perfectly sanctified, worshipping before the throne of God: and of the Lamb, where his Servants serve him, and see his face! O my Soul, be thou in the Spirit with those, doing their work and enjoying their priviledg, by improving a mystical Membership! Lo, there the new four-squared City, Christ's Father's house, which he is gone before to prepare, that He and His good Dis∣ciples may be together there! Enter in there and take possession of thy mansion! Behold, above this lower Firmament are the Treasures of Rain and of Dew, of Snow and of Hail, of all the upper waters! when thou hast been there, where thou hopest to be for ever, come down a while, and let thine Eye glance it self upon the visible objects of this middle world! seest thou the yonder azure expanse! O what a goodly Canopy hath the LORD spread over thy head! observest thou what glittering spangles the starry studs are, what shining balls the Sun and Moon are! how glorious is their beauty, how golden are their beams, how operative their influences? All that vast space of Heavens which my eye can compass, the Sun, the Moon and the stars these are thine, a Part of thy Portion: how use∣ful a Creature is that light, by which other visibles are discovered and dis∣cerned? Here mayst thou see the cloudy bottles and the flying Fowls, Here is the Air in which thou dost breath; step one stair lower now and walk the earth a while. If thou well observest it in its seasons, in its springing verdure, how lovely doth it appear in it's garnished ornaments and green attire! green! a colour both pleasing and strengthening to the Eye; whereas, if it shewed its beauty only in white, it would dazle thy fight into a blindness: O what admirable variety is there here! The grass I tread on, how many are its kinds, of how great benefit is this: The herbs were made for my use, and they have often served at my Ta∣ble, and have been both for food and for medicine: how often have the flowers perfumed the Air for me, and brought me in their sweetness, in their way of natu∣ral perception taking some kind of delight, that, their maker has put any thing in∣to them that might be pleasurable to me! How many are the sorts of Fruit-bea∣ring-trees, and how often have their fruits dropt themselves to me, and yielded themselves to my gathering, and several of them have travelled scores, hundreds, and some of them thousands of miles, to visit me, and to let me know from Christ that much of the end of their being was to find out my hand and to fill my mouth! How many springs have been flowing, and Rivers running, and wells filling, to af∣ford me water! How often have I eaten of the kidneys of wheat, of the finest of
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
the flower! How often have the well-fed both of the flock and of the herd parted with their lives, to make meats and feasts for me? What shall I say, how many thousands of hands have wrought hard for me, who never saw my face, nor knew my name? The Ploughman, the sower, the reaper, the in-gatherer, the thresher, the winnower, the seller, the miller, the kneader, the baker; the carder, the spinner, the weaver, the dyer, the clothier, the taylor, with multitudes of more, and all these, under my LORD Jesus Christ, my Servants, employed by him for a supplying good to me! Shall I now dig deep and get into the bowels of this earth? O what a hidden Kingdom of subterra∣neous minerals is here! Here are the roots of those Trees, which have afforded their beams of Timber for my habitation! Here are the quarries of stone, which have yielded materials to raise up walls for me to dwell safely within! Here the Colliers dig hard to send in winter fewel to me! Here the Searchers after the mines, do find out the Tin and the Lead, the Iron and the Steel, the Brass and the Copper, the Silver and the Gold, which so often have brought me in some of their necessary Supplies. If I go down to the Sea, the great and wide Sea, in a Ship, there I may see the works of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and his wonders in the Deeps, in the great waters which are <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 4.

There are things creeping innumerable both small and great, there the Whales, the Sea-dragons do play in the troublesom Deep, at the bottom where∣of is the mire of Depth, where is no standing. And now, my Soul, thy medita∣tions have led thee to the lowest world, to Hell beneath; a place out of which the Creator will fetch the glory of his Justice; a place full of terrible confused darkness, a place of torment. Here I see <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Job 38. 8, 9, 10. and 10. 21, 22.</NOTE> the two-leafed-doors, unfolding and opening of themselves before my thoughts, through which passage, when the dam∣ned are entred, these doors do close themselves over such <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Job 26. 7.

Thus have I taken a short view of the ma∣nifold marvellous works of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> as made in admirable wisdom! How ample and large, how clear and splendid, how illustrious and magnificent is his name in all the earth, who hath given his glorious Majesty above the Heavens! who, or what am I, that, he hath given me such an excellent formation, as to behold and admire, to acknowledg and confess his incomparable perfections in his gracious words, and in his glorious works? That, he made me a tongued Trumpeter to proclaim and to commend his power and skill in so wonderful a Creation? and that he has not taken me hence, before I left behind me some written, printed, Testi∣mony of his Royal Excellencies. I was now passing into a Sabbath-enjoyment, as the last and best day of the Week, to take my sweet repose in him, who formed all these things, and who had brought forth such a world somewhat for me, vile un∣worthy sinful me. But that which was and is, through the Grace of God, an Holy Rest to me, has been, and is like further to be, through the corruptions of men, a troublesom Controversie from them. Must I now be made a man of contention, who have so much desired and endeavoured to be a man of Peace! My LORD is going forth in his comely Honour, riding upon the word of his Truth, and he will prosper: His Truth is victorious; for this must I be valiant and earnestly contend in his strength: For this end was he born, and for this cause came he in∣to the world, that he should bear witness unto the Truth; Every one that is of the Truth, heareth his voice: Happy is he, who has a good report of the Truth it self.</P>
<P>In the Order of my pursuit after the refining and raising of useful Arts and pro∣fitable Knowledges, I am now led to that day, the Seventh, which is the last day in the week, wherein <HI>Aelohim</HI> the Creator himself did Sabbatize; on this day he rested to contemplate his own Works: For, having now framed and disposed the glorious Fabrick and the goodly structure of the whole Universe; and having put it into its beauteous ceconomy and regular Polity, he closeth the week with a day,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
blessed above all the other foregoing days of the Week. The righteous cause of which sanctified Day I am now to plead, against the many Contenders against it.</P>
<P>Having thus in a former Treatise, attended, followed and walked with <HI>Aelohim</HI> in some of his great Works on the several distinct six foregoing days of this crea∣ted World; I am now brought to Sabbatize, and rest with, and in, Him, on his Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath. There are divers profitable Disquisitions that might be made with respect to the Seventh, which is the last, Day of every Week; For the advancement of this Holy Art, and for the Improvement of this Spiritual Sci∣ence, which would be a great promoting to this useful Learning: As,</P>
<P>Q. Whether every Day of the week be of equal length? Particularly, whether the Seventh-day, which is the last day in every week, be not longer in time, and have more minutes in it, than the First day of the week? If the Seventh-day be found longer in time, it has a concreated Excellency, in nature, unchangeable, dignoscible to Sense.</P>
<P>Q. Whether <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> be from <HI>Shabath,</HI> or from <HI>Jachab?</HI> If from <HI>Shabath,</HI> there are many Truths and Duties which that word would clear up, and also demon∣strate the Observation of the weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath before the Promulga∣tion of the Law of the Ten words at Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Whether <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> do point out the daily and weekly seasons of created, in∣stituted time, for daily-evening-and-morning-Worship, and for weekly-Sab∣bath-Worship?</P>
<P>Q. Whether <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> do not in divers Scriptures set out the Seventh, the last, day of the Week? and this, in some places, before <HI>Aelohims</HI> proclaiming of the Ten words, at <HI>Horeb?</HI></P>
<P>Q. Whether, the LORD Jesus Christ, having risen again the Third day accord∣ing to the Scriptures, that Third day, be the Full complete Third day from the time of his burial? and what that particular large day of the week was? and what the certain hour of that particular large day was, in which He did actu∣ally arise? and what Scripture-evidence there is of this, which is queried, not at all in the least to question the Truth of his Resurrection, which we firmly believe, but rather to strengthen our Faith therein, and to promote Scripture∣knowledg of the Doctrine of Christs Resurrection, upon which the whole of the Christian Religion doth so much depend, and for some other good ends?</P>
<P>For the present there are some weighty reasons, why I do not interpose my own Apprehensions about these <HI>Quaeries,</HI> but leave them to those, who are of studious inquiring Spirits, who by a deeper search into the word of Truth in the Supplies of the Holy Spirit, may make those Discoveries that will at once, both convince, and shame the ignorant-mistaking-World: Whilst, for the better satisfaction of se∣rious seekers after Christs mind about the weekly-Sabbath, I shall in a Word-way, through the whole Scripture, where this Case is spoken to and of, treat of this one Enquiry, returning a plain, and, as I judge, a full Answer thereunto.</P>
<P>Q. Whether, the Seventh Day, which is the last Day in, and of, the Week, in the weekly Revolutions and orderly Returns thereof, has been from the begin∣ning, and so continued to be all the old-Testament-administration of Grace through, and be so under the New Testament Dispensation of Grace all along to this Age of the Church, and will be so to the end of this World, the weekly-Sabbath-day?</P>
<P>A. The Seventh-day, which is the last day in, and of, the week, in the weekly Revolutions and orderly Returns thereof, has been from the beginning, and so continued to be all the Old-Testament-Administration of Grace through, and is so under the New-Testament-Dispensation of Grace, all along to this Age of the Church, and will be so to the end of this World, the weekly-Sabbath-day. The whole Scripture is profitable for this Doctrine, and for this Duty.</P>
<P>This closing part of the History of the Creation is express for it. When <HI>Jeho∣vah Aelohim</HI> had finished all his Works, relating unto the six foregoing days of this one week: <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2, 3. Exod. 20. 10, 11. Hebs. 4. 3, 4.</NOTE> The LORD Christ now on the Seventh-day actually perfected, and will continue actually perfect in the whole, and in every part of it, His dele∣gated-work, which he had made (adornedly-really to exist preparedly perfected,)
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
and He did then Sabbatize, (and his will was, is, and will be, that from thence his people shall Sabbatize,) (ceasing, resting, from other motion and work of the fore-mentioned creating kind) In a Day, that Seventh from all his Work, the which he had made, and he did and will bless (in word and in deed, in a continued way in the weekly revolutions of it, as long as weeks shall last in this world) That day, That Seventh, and he did and will sanctifie (by severing it from a common use, and destinating it to an Holy Use, accomodating it to instituted Ordinances of solemn Worship,) the same, because in it he hath sabbatized, and will Sabbatize, from all his work, the which he had created (pure without spot or blemish of corruptness or uncomeliness) for to make. This Seventh is a Number completely perfecting the Week: For, when such a number of days hath filled up the week, then we begin again, with one, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth, till it comes to another seventh: And there the Week in the continued revolutions thereof doth, still re∣ceive a perfective end. The <HI>Greek</HI> Interpreters <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2.</NOTE> here (as in a many of other Scrip∣tures else where) are Corrupters of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Text, who do translate, in the sixth day, for the Seventh, and their pretended reason is frivolous, lest the Heathen should think, (mistaking the phrase) that <HI>Aelohim</HI> did work upon the Seventh-day-Sabbath. Whereas he had finished the whole, and every part of his creating work upon the several six foregoing days of this one week of the created world: Only he did that on the Seventh-day, which was proper Sabbath-Work: As the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mar. 2. 27. The Sabbath was made. Ex∣od. 20. 11. Hebrew 4. 3, 4. John 5. 17.</NOTE> making of the Seventh-day, the resting from other Functions upon it to institute and observe Sabbath-duties, employments and priviledges, the blessing of it, the sanctifying of it, together with his preserving of the Creatures which he had made on the six foregoing days, and with his and his Fathers providential working to the upholding of them in their Being. Those who do call the First day the Seventh day, and the Seventh day the sixth day, making the First day to be both the First and the Seventh day, and so do alter the names of the number of all the rest, do invert the Order of nature in the First Creation: For, although in con∣sistent quantity (such as Extension of parts one beyond another,) there is not one, second, third, fourth, and so on, or not one first, and another last, put into the na∣ture of that created Being; because, these are not really in the confistent Nature thereof; it being consistent altogether, and so the first part may be the last part, or the last part the first part, according to mens common notion, and reckoning and appointing of it to be so, the LORD not having instituted herein any such Order of Numbring, where we are to begin, and how to go on, and where to end: yet, in quantity successive, as in duration, and in time, this is of a different consideration, both in the nature of the thing and in <HI>Aelohims</HI> institution: For this is really such in existence, truly subsisting, whether we imagine it or not; neither is it left in our power to our disposal, to put them into any other Order than the creating Messaiah hath, so far as doth respect his established times and his instituted Seasons: There is one day, a second day, a third day, a fourth day, a fifth day, a sixth day, and a seventh day, in the several successive natures and durations of every one of them: Here is part after part by temporary succession in a most direct line, and in its proper Partitions and terminating points, by an unchangeable Law, and well-setled-order, of the standing Creation. The Work of the six foregoing Days <HI>Aelohim</HI> did rest from (leaving man an example to follow him herein) on the Seventh-day-Sabbath. The Seventh-day is to be remitted unto Workers, who laboured in their several lawful Functions on every day of the week before; and <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 11.</NOTE> therefore <HI>Aelohim</HI> blessed this Seventh-day; because, he himself rested on it, and sanctified it, unto <HI>Adam;</HI> the Sabbath was made <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Mar. 2. 27.

He hath made, he doth, he will, make it a blessed day in its weekly returns unto the due diligent ob∣servers thereof, in obedience to his Command, in obsequiousness to his Will, in Conformity to his Example, in Faith on his Truth, Power and Promise: For, this Day hath he severed unto his own service along.

The preceding Hebrew accent, doth somewhat teach this, which doth often distinguish; so that, it signifies that <HI>Adam</HI> and his posterity ought to do this; to observe the Seventh-day-Sabbath, as holy and consecrated to <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> it is their bounden duty to do the same: The

Having thus somewhat explained and applyed the Expressions concerning the Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath in its primitive Creation and unchanged Institu∣tion; I am now to make a little way for the giving the Reader a more particular distinct full Account, according to the Scriptures of Truth, why I do judge that the Seventh-day, which is the last day, in every week, in the weekly Returns of it, is alone that particular peculiar day in every Week, which is the Weekly Sabbath-day, to be kept Holy unto <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> in obedience to his command, as such, that is to say, as the alone weekly Sabbath-day. If any man hereafter will engage by Writing or Printing in this Controversie against me, whereby to endeavour to build up, if he could; his first day, on the ruines of the Seventh-day-Sabbath; let him take notice and remember, that I mention my Judgment on this (as in other cases) Subject-matter to be according to the Scriptures of Truth, and that I expect both he and I should submit our Judgment and Practise unto the Autoritative, decisive Judgment of the Spirit of Christ in the word of Truth: Those that do resolve such cases of Conscience about Duty or Sin into other Authorities, do judge, but ac∣cording to appearance: That judgment which is <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">John 7. 23, 24. 1 Cor. 10. 15. and 7. 25, 40. 1 Cor. 15. 3. 14.

And whither shall we go to get our selves cloathed with Sabbath Righteous∣ness, but unto him, putting on this Lord Jesus, and making this <HI>Jehovah</HI> to be our Righteousness? How can there be such an apt, proper, distinct, suitable, Sabbath-Righteousness from Christ, applyed to the Soul, but by those who make out after that weekly seventh-day-Sabbath-Righteousness, which was in its perfection in Christ? Those that observe any other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath, can∣not so directly go to Christ for such a days Righteousness, not particularly for the First-days Righteousness, as to a Sabbath; which First day Christ all his life through never observed, as the weekly Sabbath. He has left us an example (a Pattern, a Copy, such as Writing Masters do leave to their Scholars) that, we should follow his steps. He that saith he abideth in Christ ought himself also <HI>to walk even as he walked:</HI> Because, as he is, so are we in this World, (if we keep to his Rule and Ex∣ample, for the Scripture speaks of things as they ought to be, taking it for gran∣ted that they be so, and they are so, so far forth as Believers do act regularly like themselves, as doth become them.) According to this Pattern we have <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Act. 13. 14, &amp;c, Act. 17. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 16. 13-16. and 18. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> pra∣ctising after Christs Ascension into Heaven, on every Sabbath-day; it was his Cu∣stom and Usage, his constant Practice <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Compare Luke 4. 16. with Act 17. 2. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, As it was, so to Christ, so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>▪</NOTE>, the same Expression, that sets out Christs continued weekly observing of the Seventh-day-Sabbath that it was usual to him, is affirmed also of that eminent Servant of his; That, it was also usual to this <HI>Paul,</HI> O that the same might be truly testified of more in our Day, of Leaders and of their People, that, Christ might hold such forth before others and say: Here are they that keep the Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jesus: The Holy Seed of Christ and of his Church are such, as keep these Commands of God, and have the Testimony of Jesus Christ. O the happy Progresses, O the blessed goings on with a strait foot, of such as do his Commandments!</P>
<P>A Second Reason of his affixing to this Holy Law of the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath, who is Wisdom essential, Wisedoms, All Wisdoms in one, is this: For that, <HI>Aelohim</HI> blessed the Seventh, which is the last day in the week, that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the weekly-Sabbath-day. Thus it was from the beginning, and thus it is, and will be to hidden ages of hidden ages. The blessing is its peculiar Portion, and what is Man that he will take away this He∣ritage of Blessing from the Seventh-day to endeavour to settle it on any other day on the first day particularly, where the LORD himself never so gave and secu∣red it? <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2, 3.</NOTE> The Seventh-day, the Seventh-day, <HI>Aelohim</HI> blessed, the Seventh-day, he hath blessed it, he doth bless it, and he will bless it, and it shall be blessed.

This blessing was afterwards renewed, revived, solemnly, openly declared <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 9, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0, 11.</NOTE> at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and affix'd to the

seventh-day: <HI>Six days thou shalt labour, but the seventh-day is the Sabbath:</HI> In it thou shalt not do any work: For six days <HI>Jehovah</HI> made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh-day: Wherefore <HI>Jehovah</HI> bles∣sed that day, that Sabbath, the blessing is gone forth for this Seventh-day-Sabbath irreversibly from the Mouth of <HI>Jehovah Mashiach</HI> himself: It has his Applaud and approve for its due estimation and deserved renown, its noble majestickness and Royal imperialness. How many are the Prerogatives and Priviledges which he hath Conferred upon it! Christ is the Seventh-daies-benedictor and benefactor. This is the day which he hath Dedicated to the Instituted worship and service of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim;</HI> A day greatly to be desired and delighted in by his Children, Friends and Servants, as a day of holy rest, and of Heavenly joy; A day of sweet converse between him and his Saints: A day that calleth upon them for a singing∣shouting-triumphing-rejoycing-frame! and therefore there is a peculiar <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Psal. 92. title compared with the rest of the Psalm▪.</NOTE> Psalm fitted for this purpose, to this end: Thus is the Crown of special Benediction put upon the head of the Seventh-day, and no other foregoing day of the Week is to share with it in this princely honour. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Isai. 56. 1-8 reade and consider, how many special Blessings are here made o∣ver.</NOTE> <HI>Isaiah,</HI> that evangelical Prophecier and Preacher, has from <HI>Jehovah</HI> Pronounced those Blessed even to admiration, (O the happy Progresses, O the happy goings on of such!) that do keep this Sabbath, and not prophane it! They shall enjoy many a covenant-favour! O how choice Spiritual blessings are there that do visit the Hearts of Holy observers of this Se∣venth-day-Sabbath! under the New-Testament Administration, O what a Blessed day did Christ make it to be unto some, whose sick bodies he healed, whose sinful Souls he pardoned, whose sadned Spirits he comforted; unto whom his Gracious words were converting and Restoring, teaching and enlightning, quick∣ning and strengthning, whom he met in Sabbath ordinances, and gave them the Blessing of this separated day! and how many a Soul had cause to bless the LORD for ever, who so prospered <HI>Pauls</HI> labours on the <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Acts. 13. Acts. 17. Acts. 18.</NOTE> Seventh-day-Sabbath, for blessing, for good to them! Christ taught daily in the Temple, and <HI>Paul</HI> was of∣ten in the Synagogues on the foregoing daies of the Week, and much good was done thereby, but the whole Scripture doth take peculiar notice of this, That, the Seventh-day as the Weekly Sabbath-day, carried away the Sabbath-blessings, which no other day in the week did, though the LORD do bless his People eve∣ry day, yet not with Sabbath-blessings, but only on the seventh-day. <HI>Aelohim</HI> gave a Special Blessing, an appropriated Blessing, to this day above all the other daies. So true and good is that saying of Christ still, That <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Mar. 2. 27. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> this Sabbath was made for <HI>Adam,</HI> for Man, for a blessing to him, every way for his cheifest and choicest good▪. It was Christs counsel to his Dsiciples, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Mat. 24. 20.</NOTE> that, when troublous times would be some years after his Ascending into the highest Heavens, they would be much in Pray∣er, that, upon the Enemies Invading their Land, their flight might not be on the Sabbath, lest they should be hindered from, or disturbed in the Blessings of that seventh-day, which alone has the Name of the Weekly Sabbath. Thus is the whole Scripture profitable for the clearing and confirming of these two Reasons of Christs Assigning, as I am now also further to manifest, that, it is so for his third Reason which is this, because <HI>Aelohim</HI> sanctified the seventh, which is the last day in every week, that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the Weekly Sabbath-day. Thus at the <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Genes. 2. 2. 3.</NOTE> First Creation and Institution; the seventh day, the seventh-day, the seventh-day, <HI>Aelohim</HI> sanctified it, because, that, in it he had rested from all his work, which he Created, for to make or to do. He hath sanctified this same seventh-day, he doth and he will sanctifie it, setting it a∣part as the only weekly Sabbath-day, for Spiritual services and for other holy ends, he segregated it from all prophane common employments and usages, and dedi∣cated it to his own peculiar worship. It was not to be reckoned nor counted a∣mongst vulgar daies, but was to be had and held <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Isai. 58. 13.</NOTE> as solemn and sacred, holy and honourable, desirable and delightful. He hath put a difference between this se∣venth day and other daies, by way of Excellency, in a dignifying manner, by appro∣priating and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evering of it in the special holiness thereof, from ordinary foregoing week-daies, that are but of a common rank, that it may be singularly filled up as becometh the sanctity or holiness of it. By this derived or relative sanctity, it is the peculiar appropriate day of <HI>Jehovah <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lohim.</HI> He has separated Ordinances
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
for his separated People on this separated day! O how holy is <HI>Jehovahs</HI> seventh-day-sabbath on which he would have his Worshippers to be so Holy! All here, in this History of the Creation is actual and real, Anticipations here, have no such place as those pretend who would have this sanctification of the seventh day, as a Weekly Sabbath, to be only in <HI>Aelohims</HI> Decree and destination, as if it took not place actually till the proclaiming of the Law at <HI>Mount-Sinai</HI> which was above two thousand years after; for, this Scripture, as others also collated with it, do e∣vidently shew that it was thus set apart, from the beginning of the World from <HI>Adams</HI> time and so downwards. This History doth treat of Existences, of Beings in their Created nature: As <HI>Aelohim</HI> rested on that day Actually, and it was made for <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Mar. 2. 27. Heb. 4. 3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>Adam</HI> and for his posterity for that purpose and end, that he and they might sanctifie it, and that it might be a blessed day to him and to them. The Creator and maker of daies did put apart the seventh-day from all and from every of other daies for peculiar uses and Ends. The Proof is convincing enough to the Ingeni∣ous and unprejudiced, that the sanctification of the seventh-day-Sabbath, was before the promulgation of it at <HI>Sinai: Moses</HI> speaks of it, as of a thing known, using the same reasons and grounds of equity, and much in the same words, which <HI>Aelohim</HI> himself used in the proclaiming, and referring to the first institution of <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 23. 30.</NOTE> labouring on the six fore going daies and Sabbatizing on the seventh, where the seventh day is mentioned four times, and Sabbath, Sabbatism, Rest, Rested, about six times, declaring, that, in times past, of old, <HI>Jehovah</HI> had given the Sabbath for this end, that in it there should be a ceasing from ordinary Labour, and according∣ly the People rested on the seventh-day-Sabbath; at <HI>Mount-Sinai</HI> the promulgator of this Law himself delivers his mind to be still the same in much plainness of speech, <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 8, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> six daies thou shalt labour, but the seventh day is the Sabbath, in it thou shalt not do any work, for, six daies <HI>Jehovah</HI> made the <HI>Heavens</HI> and the <HI>Earth,</HI> the <HI>Sea,</HI> and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore <HI>Jehovah</HI> hallowed the Sabbath day, he sacrated it, consecrated it, sanctified it, restored it to its holy use, he spiritually distinguished it from the other foregoing six daies of the week: Setting it apart for his more solemn worship and institu∣ted service: And thus you may carry this sanctification of it through the rest of the Scriptures that do treat on this subject; for, the People of God all along were Sabbath-keepers, and <HI>Aelohim-</HI>worshippers: They remembred this as that word of memoir and of remark, bringing in this Law upon their hearts as of special ob∣servance. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Isai. 56. 2-8. &amp; 66. 23.</NOTE> The sanctification of the sabbath doth set out sometimes, the whole worship of God; for, where this is duly observed it doth promote all other re∣ligion; and it is put Prophetically by <HI>Isaiah</HI> for the spiritual worship under the New Testament dispensation; it was instituted to the end, that, solemn service might be performed to the LORD therein: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Lev. 23. 3. 2.

<P>And now, is it not great and good reason, that these reasons of <HI>Aelohims</HI> own giving should have a convincing-cogency, and winning perswasiveness upon our hearts to yield obedience unto this holy Law of his, which is every way so de∣signed and fitted for our own Good?</P>
<P>I pass on to some other spiritual proofs of this: After long and serious search into the whole scripture about this matter, I find, that all the Scriptures through, where the holy Spirit doth speak of a weekly Sabbath day, there the name and thing of a weekly Sabbath is given only to the seventh, which is the last day of the week, in the weekly revolutions and returns, and successive courses of it, and to
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
no other day of the week as a weekly-Sabbath-day: That, there is no Command given for the Observation of any other day in the week as the weekly-Sabbath-day but only of the seventh day: That, there is no promise made to the observing of any other day in the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, but only of the seventh day; and that there is no threatning either Denounced against or executed upon any, that have not observed any other day in the week, as the weekly-Sabbath-day, but only against and upon such as observed not the seventh-day as such. If it be thus, then how nameless, how Commandless, how promiseless, how threatless, is the first day of the week, as to this matter of the weekly-Sabbath-day? Examine and search we the Scriptures in this case. All the Scriptures through, where the holy spirit speaks of a weekly-sabbath day, the name and thing thereof, that is, of such a weekly-Sabbath-day, is given only to the seventh, which is the last day in the week, in the weekly returns of it, and to no other day of the week as a weekly-Sabbath-day. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2, 3.</NOTE> On the seventh-day, the seventh-day, the seventh-day, <HI>Aelohim</HI> Sabbati∣zed, he Sabbatized. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 23-30.</NOTE> The seventh-day, the seventh-day, the seventh-day, the seventh-day, the rest of the Holy Sabbath, a Sabbath, the Sabbath, the Sabbath, the People rested on it. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 10, 11.</NOTE> The seventh day is the Sabbath; in it thou shalt not do any work.

The seventh day <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Levit. 23. 3.</NOTE> the Sabbath of rest: Scores of times in the Scripture of the old testa∣ment, the seventh day is called the Sabbath. Several times also in the new Testa∣ment, about threescore times. The LORD Christ himself speaking Propheti∣cally cals it <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Mat. 24. 20.</NOTE> the Sabbath-day. Divers times in the Historie of the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Act. 13, 24, 27. &amp; 15. 21. &amp; 16. 13. &amp; 17. 2. &amp; 18. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apostles after Christs Ascension to his Father. Every Sabbath <HI>Paul</HI> reasoned in the Synagogue as his manner was. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Luk. 13. 14.</NOTE> No other day in the week is called the Sab∣bath-day. This some of the most Learned amongst the adversaries of the seventh day, having been convinced of, and finding their labours fruitless in searching af∣ter the name Sabbath to be given to the first day of the week, which is no where done, they rather oppose the name Sabbath, as not fit to be used now under the new-Testament-administration of Grace, as applyed to the weekly seperated day for Holy rest and worship; they reject it themselves, that, others too might the more abhor it, by giving it an ill name, miscalling it, the <HI>Jewish-</HI>Sabbath: So that these Enemies themselves being Judges, they confess, that all Churches do call the seventh day alone, by the old name, Sabbath. It was <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 4.</NOTE> the seventh, this seventh day; (it is double-Articled,) on which God rested from all his works. Consider further, there is not all the Scriptures through, any command given for the observation of any other day in the week asthe weekly-Sabbath-day, but only the seventh which is the last day in the week, in the weekly return of it. At the first Creation of this seventh day It was instituted for <HI>Adam</HI> to do it, and observe it, as the weekly Sabbath day, Thus before the Law was proclaimed, how long re∣fuse ye to keep my Commandements and my Laws? <HI>Jehovah</HI> hath given you the Sabbath: Let no man go out of his place <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2. 3.

Thus at the time of Promulgation. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Exod 20. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> Remember, or to remember, the Sabbath day, to keep it holy: Six daies shalt thou labour, and do all thy work, but, the seventh day is the Sabbath of <HI>Jehovah</HI> thy God.

In obedience to this Law and Command of Christ it was that <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Act. 13 14.-44 &amp; 16. 13. &amp; 17. 2. 3. &amp; 18. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> preached, and the People heard the word of God on this Sabbath-day, some years after Christ was Ascended up into Glory. Whither can the Observers of the First day (as the Weekly Sabbath-day) go to find out Commands in the whole Scripture for their day? One of the adver∣saries of the seventh-day-Sabbath, who appeared in Writing against a Letter of another to him, upon his own desire, which conteined some reasons and Scriptures for the weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath, He, in delivering his Judg∣ment concerning the First day, upon this Question, whether there be any Ex∣press word for the Institution of the first day of the week to be observed as the Lords-day, the day for his Weekly Sabbath? has these passages; we might say, that, it might be Instituted, though it be not Recorded, (he meaneth in the Scriptures.) When and where; and again, tis acknowledged, saith he, we have no express word, in so many letters and Words or Syllables, for the Institution of the First day of seven. And a Third time, what if it should be said, that he, (that is, that Jesus Christ the Mediator,) did according to his Power actually change the day, though when, and how, it be not recorded? And a Fourth time, why might he not Institute this, (he intends the first,) day, although it be not expressed, when or where, and though it be not recorded? Observe here, thou who readest this with a desire to have the mind of Christ in this matter: Suppose in the serious tenderness of thy Heart thou shouldest enquire of this Answer∣er, whether there be any Institution of the First day of the week, to be Observed as the Weekly Sabbath-day under the New-Testament, in the Room of the week∣ly seventh-day-Sabbath; and he should say, there may be an Institution of the First day of the Week as the Weekly-Sabbath-day, though it be not recorded, Suppose thou shouldest further ask, when, for the time, might this Institution be, if it were at all? And he should reply, there might be an Institution, though
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
it be not recorded when for the time. Put case, thou demand of him further, where, for the Place might this supposed Institution be? And he should tell thee there might be an Institution though it be not Recorded, where for the place. Upon this, thou further propoundest this to him, how is this pretended Institu∣tion for the occasion or manner, that, I might be somewhat Directed in my practise, if it were manifested to be my Duty to observe the first day, as the weekly Sab∣bath-day? To which he should return thee these words: there might be an In∣stitution, though it be not recorded how for the occasion or manner. Can such answers as these give thee any Convincing Demonstration or satisfying Evidence? What? After all thy Trading in Sabbath-Religion wilt thou at last be sent thou knowest not whether, to pretended unwritten verities for thy Religion? Art thou under any Obligations of Conscience in these matters, to beleive further than what is <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">John 20. 30. 31.</NOTE> written? Can thy spiritual Appetite <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4. 6.</NOTE> savour in such Cases, what is not written? As for any other Framed, Fancyed, Forged, Grounds of Insti∣tuting the First day as the weekly Sabbath-day, from pretended practise of the Apostles for this end, in this, or any other Author I meet with, or from what other Reasons Conjecturally, unscripturally suggested, it will be spoken unto in its place: Only here is one part of the fore-mentioned passage, which I would write somewhat about, lest the force of the answerers Arguing should be thought to be passed by unobserved, which is that expression, (according to his Power) whereby the answerer intends, that, Jesus Christ as Mediator had Power to Change the Weekly Sabbath from the Seventh which is the last day to the First day of the Week. What Power the LORD Jesus Christ as Mediator has received, I thankfully acknowledge, and through Mercy and Grace purchased by him for me, and freely, richly given from the Father to me, in the supplies of the holy Spirit, I have been for several years an applyer of, a liver upon, and somewhat an Im∣prover of, though I find great cause to be deeply humbled, for that, I have put it to no better use. As for the Power of Christ, considering him as mediator, we have it from his own Mouth <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">John 5. 22, 27. &amp; 3. 35.</NOTE> in his life time; that, the Father had given all Judgment unto the Son: That the Father hath given unto Christ Power to do Judgment, because, he is the Son of Man, that, the Father hath given all things into his hand. And a little before his death, that, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">John 17. 2.</NOTE> the Father gave him power of all Flesh: And after his Resurrection, that <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mat. 28. 18.</NOTE> unto him all Authoritative Power was given in Heaven and on Earth. This is my Faith and my Food: Yet withal it must be considered, that Christ, as Mediator, was one put into Office by his Fa∣ther, and sent by him in a delegated Function, having his proper work assigned him: And thus, his Power was Limited. Let us search whether the whole Scripture be profitable for this? In the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Deut. 18. 15, 18, 19. Acts 3. 22. &amp; 7. 37. compa∣red.</NOTE> there is a Prophesie, that, <HI>Jehovah</HI> the <HI>Aelohim</HI> of his People would raise up unto them a Prophet, (meaning the LORD Jesus Christ, as is manifest by a collation of those other Scriptures which do so interpret this,) from the midst of them, of their Brethren like unto <HI>Moses,</HI> unto him they were to hearken, and I, said <HI>Jehovah</HI> the Father, will give my words into his Mouth, and he shall speak unto the People, all that I shall Command him: And it shall come to pass, that, the Man who will not hearken to my words, which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. Remark here: It was the Father who raised up Christ to this Office of being a Prophet, they were the Fathers words which were given into Christs Mouth: and Christ was to speak unto the People all that which the Father should Command him: They must be the Fathers words, and it must be in the Fathers Name, that Christ was to speak. To this Clause in the Commission must Christ keep close: And accordingly so he did. In the Book of the after-Prophets you may read <HI>Jehovah</HI> the Father thus speaking concerning his Son Christ, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Isai. 42. 1. compared with Mat. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 18. &amp; Phil. 2. 6, 7. 8.</NOTE> behold, my servant whom I uphold, mine Elect, my Soul delighteth, I have given my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth Judgment to the Nations: Christ as Mediator, was his Fathers Servant, he took upon him the Form of a Servant, and the Servant must keep close to the will and word and Command of him whose Servant he is, especially in this case, where all and every of the words, and wills and Commands of the Father are Holy, just and good.

I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed, that, thou didst send me, I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them. An exact punctual just accompt of this great undertaking and Transacting will Christ give and deliver up to his Father in the latter day. The discerning Reader may see, how express Christ is in this matter; he exerciseth his Power according to his Fathers will and word. And the Father, as also the Son from the Father; hath not revealed any such thing in the word of truth, as the Change of the Weekly Sabbath from the last to the first day of the Week: There is no appearance of any such Institution or Command. Christ came not to make a Change in any one of the Laws of the ten words. where did the Father put any such words into Christs mouth? and where did Christ ever speak any such words? As Christ was to speak what words the Father put in∣to his mouth, So also the Holy Spirit of Truth; whom the Father sent in Christs name, <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">John 16. 13.</NOTE> he was not to speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, saith Christ to his Disciples, that shall ye speak. How much less should any meer Man or Men speak a word about a pretended Change of the Sabbath, which is a saying of their own, and not a word from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: in this or in any other Case?

that <HI>Moses</HI> did as <HI>Jehovah</HI> commanded him.

Now, who can say, with any truth in his saying, thus saith <HI>Jehovah.</HI> The first day (of the Week) is the Sabbath, (Weekly in the Room of the Seventh, the last day of the Week).</P>
<P>I am now to speak of the Promise. There is no Promise made to the observing of any other day in the Week as the Weekly-Sabbath-day, but only of the seventh-day, which is the last day in the Week, in the weekly returns of it. Here all that might be resumed, which is Written about <HI>Aelohims</HI> Blessing of the seventh day; and that only, as the Weekly Sabbath-day. To which also might be added all those promises which more at large are made over to those, that keep and obey all and every of the Commands of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim:</HI> Whereof this of observing of the Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath, is one: But I would keep close to this Subject matter. The seventh-day-Sabbath is <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 29. Ezek. 20. 12.</NOTE> a gift from <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> to be a sign between him and between his People, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Exod. 31. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

How free is that Love, how rich that Grace which is put in to this Covenant! And this is an∣nexed to the seventh day, as the Sabbath of Rest, Holiness to <HI>Jehovah.</HI> What kind of sign this is, may be spoken unto in another place, <HI>Moses</HI> in his repeating of this Law of the Weekly <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Deut. 5. 12-15.</NOTE> seventh-day-Sabbath doth four several-times put this Covenant of Grace by Express terms into this Command, whereby Hearts should be the more drawn into orderly Obedience thereunto: That, the same <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> who proclaimed the Holy Law together with the other Nine, was their <HI>Aelohim,</HI> theirs in a peculiar especial distinguishing manner who conformed in all things to his revealed will, and stood compleat and perfect in his whole will, and therefore should they be engaged and be encouraged, to do the Sabbath day, to Hallow it, as he had commanded them. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Levit. 26. 2. &amp;c. also.

Sabbath-worship on the Sabbath-day, in this Sabbath, (For the instituted day of the Week∣ly Sabbath must be observed, to be accepted,) shall be a Savour of Rest to me, said <HI>Jehovah.</HI> Thus also in the Prophets: <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Isai. 56. 1.-8.</NOTE> That Evangelical Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> sweetly thus; Blessed is the Man, or O the blessedness, or happy Progresses (or Blessed goings on with a streight foot, for such will make a good Progress in other Religion, who are found walking on Prosperously in this Sabbath-way) of that <HI>Aenosh,</HI> and the son of Man, of <HI>Adam</HI> that keepeth the Sabbath, so that he doth not pollute it, or not Prophane it! For thus saith <HI>Jehovah</HI> to them, that keep these my Sab∣baths: (not those that are of Mens inventing and imposing: Contrary to these seventh-day-Sabbaths which are of his Instituting, and which he doth own as his peculiar) and have chosen in what I delight, or have pleasingly willed, and who taking hold of my Convenant I will give unto them in my House, and within my Walls an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off, I will bring them to the Mount of my Holiness, and I will make them joyfull in my house of Prayer; their Sacrifices and their Offerings shall be accepted upon mine altar. And in another place <HI>Jehovah</HI> hath prophecyed and promised, that he will raise up such as shall be Restorers of Paths to Sabbatize in, saying, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Isai. 58. 13. 13. 14.</NOTE> if thou turn away from the Sabbath thy Feet to do thy pleasure on mine Holy day, and thou call the Sabbath a de∣light the Holy of <HI>Jehovah</HI> Honorable, and thou hast Honoured, shalt Honour him, not doing thy own waies, nor finding thy own pleasure, nor speaking (thy own,) words, then shalt thou delight thy self in <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and I will cause thee to Ride upon the High places of the Earth, and I will feed thee with the Inheritance of <HI>Jacob</HI> thy Father; <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Isai. 66. 23.</NOTE> From the time of the Sabbath in his Sabbath, all Flesh shall come for to bow down to my Face, saith <HI>Jehovah.</HI> The Prophet <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ierem. 17. 21, 22, 24, 25. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Jeremiah</HI>

doth also bring good and comfortable words from <HI>Jehovah</HI> to right observers of the seventh-day-Sabbath. Thus saith <HI>Jehovah,</HI> bear no Burden on the Sabbath-day. Hallow ye the Sabbath day, as I commanded your Fathers: It shall come to pass, if Hearkening ye shall Hearken unto me, to bring in no Burden through the Gates of the City on the Sabbath-day, and shall Hallow the Sabbath day to do no work therein, then shall there enter into the Gates of this City Kings and Princes sitting upon the Throne of David, Riding in Chariots and on Horses, they and their Princes, the Men of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the Inhabitants of <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> and this City shall remain for ever, and they shall come from the Cities of <HI>Judah,</HI> and from the places about <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and from the Land of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and from the Plain, and from the Mountains, and from the South, bringing Burnt Offerings and Sacrifices, and Meat Offerings and Incense; and bringing Sacrifices of Praise unto the House of <HI>Jehovah.</HI> They are sweet precious Words those by the <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 20. 11. 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 41.</NOTE> Prophet <HI>Ezekiel.</HI> I, saith the LORD, gave them my starutes and shewed them my Judge∣ments, which if a Man do, he shall even live in them: Moreover I gave them my Sabbaths, but they despised my Judgements, which if a Man do he shall even live in them: This is twice expressed as a gracious encouraging Promise; and a Third time it is Covenanted there, I <HI>Jehovah</HI> your <HI>Aelohim,</HI> Hallow my Sabbaths, that ye may know that I <HI>Jehovah</HI> your <HI>Aelohim;</HI> and I will accept you with your Savour of Rest. There is one <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Psal. 92. title, compared with the rest.</NOTE> Psalm, that has several Choice promises in it, and the Title of it is, a Psalm or Hymn for the Sabbath-day, which is to be carried through that Psalm. Those who keep the Seventh-day-Sabbath shall experience <HI>Jehovahs</HI> Loving kindness in the Morning, and his faithfulness in the Nights, they shall be made Glad through his work, they shall Triumph in the Works of his Hands: They shall have their Horn, (their Power, their Strength, their Defence, their Glory, their Honour, their Dignity, their Exaltation, their Firmness, their long-continued happiness) like that of an Unicorn: They shall be poured over with Green Oyl (with new revivings and pleasant refreshings:) Their Eyes shall see on their spying Enemies, and their Ears shall hear concerning the Evil∣doers which rise up against them. Such Righteous ones as are due Observers of this seventh-day-Sabbath, shall grow like to a Palm-tree: They shall grow like a Cedar-tree in <HI>Lebanon,</HI> To them that are thus Planted in the House of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> those they shall make to grow in the Courts of their God. They shall bear Fruit yet in the Gray Age: They shall be fat and green: If all and every of these were opened and applyed at Large, O how much of rich treasure is there in them! The <HI>Chaldee</HI> upon the Title of this Psalm doth thus paraphrase, An Hymn, which the First Man <HI>Adam</HI> said for the Sabbath day. And the Seventy two Greek Interpreters have a double Article here, a Psalm of a Song unto that day of the Sabbath: The same Sabbath-day that was the Seventh day of the Week from the Creation; which was to be Sanctified, as many other ways, so particularly by Singing of Psalms. This Psalm has divers Prophetical passages in it relating to New-Testament-promises, especially in the Latter-day-glory of this dispensation of Grace. It is Judged by the Hebrews to be penned by <HI>Adam,</HI> when he beheld the Glorious Works of the Creator, and commending it prophetically to after-ages. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Mar. 2. 27. Mat. 24. 20.</NOTE> The New-Testament gives us to know from the mouth of our LORD Christ himself, the Commander and observer, the blesser, and the Sanctifier, of this Seventh-day-Sabbath, that, It was made for <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him for all man∣kind, for their Happiness, for their Good, if they would be diligent observers of it: And that, to be forced to flee from Sabbath-work and enjoyments, was to be driven from special priviledges, which sore Judgement those who are Sabbath-ob∣servers should endeavour by Prayer to keep off, lest otherwise it did so befal them.</P>
<P>Let it also be duly pondered upon in this one weighty consideration more, that there is no threatning either denounced against or executed upon any that shall not observe any other day in the Week as a Weekly-Sabbath-day, but only against and upon such as will not observe the seventh day; which is the last day in every Week. In the Book of <HI>Moses</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 23.-35.</NOTE> before the Proclaiming of the Law of the Ten words at Mount-<HI>Sinai</HI> the <HI>Israelites</HI> were to gather <HI>Manna</HI> on the six foregoing daies of the Week, and on the sixth day (that sixth, the day immediately before the Seventh, that, there could be no mistake of the day) the bread of two daies, one part
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
whereof being kept for Food on the seventh day Sabbath, did neither melt nor stink, neither was any Worm therein: yet notwithstanding this wonderful ap∣pearance of <HI>Jehovah</HI> for the sustenance and Food of his people, who but a little be∣fore had murmured and complained for want of Bread, there were of the People who went out on the Seventh day for to gather <HI>Manna,</HI> and they found none. Up∣on this, <HI>Jehovah</HI> steps in with his prohibition and threatning, and said unto <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> how long refuse ye to keep my Commandements and my Laws! See for that <HI>Jehova</HI> hath given you the Sabbath, (this Sabbath, this noted day,) therefore he giveth you on that sixth day the Bread of two daies, abide ye every Man in his place, let no man, (not a Man of you, if you dare to transgress, it will be to your hurt: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is a Particle of Dehorting and of Deprecating) go out of his place on this se∣venth day: And that, this seventh-day Sabbath might have the more confirming Sanction, <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> continues this miraculous way of seeding of his people for about Fourty years, and takes order for the preserving of a Pot of this <HI>Manna,</HI> to be laid up to the Faces of <HI>Jehovah</HI> to be kept for their generations, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Comparae Josh 5. 12.</NOTE> for the bet∣ter establishing of the Doctrine of Weeks, and of the certainty and duty of obser∣ving the seventh-day-Sabbath; which admirable appearing if we reckon it seven times over for every Week, six times for the fall of <HI>Manna,</HI> on the six foregoing daies of each Week, and a seventh time for the preserving of that part of the double portion on the Seventh day which was gathered on the Sixth day; the Number amounts to above fourteen Thousand times. At the Promulgation of the Law; <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Exod 20. 9, 10.

Yet also I lifted up my hand un∣to them in the Wilderness, that I would not bring them into the Land which I had given them Flowing with <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Hony;</HI> which are the Glory of all Lands. Because, they despised my Judgments and walked not in my Statutes, but, pol∣luted my Sabbaths: But, I said unto their Children in the Wilderness, Hallow my Sabbaths: Notwithstanding the Children rebelled against me, they polluted my Sabbaths: Then I said (observe he takes notice a second time of this time of the Provocation was given him by them this way) I would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the Wilderness. The like we have in <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 22, 26. 31.</NOTE> another place of the same Prophet, her Priests (speaking of <HI>Jerusalem)</HI> have violated my Law, and have profaned my Holy things: They have put no diffe∣rence between the Holy and Profane, neither have they shewed between the un∣clean and the Clean, and have hid their Eyes from my Sabbaths, (even admini∣strators about Holy things do some times hide their Eyes from <HI>Jehovahs</HI> Sabbaths,) and I am profaned among them. Therefore have I poured out my indignation up∣on them; I have Consumed them with the Fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompenced upon their heads, saith <HI>Adonai Jehovah.</HI> Such a passage we also find in the Prophecie by <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Amos. 8. 4-14.</NOTE> <HI>Amos,</HI> hear this, O ye, who saying, when will the Sab∣bath be gone, (they thought the seventh day the longest day in the Week,) that we may set forth wheat, making the Ephah Small and the Shekel great, and pervert∣ing the Balances of deceit: <HI>Jehovah</HI> hath sworn by the Excellency of <HI>Jacob</HI> surely, I will never forget any of their works: Shall not the Land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your Songs into Lamentation: I will send a Famine of hearing the words of <HI>Jeho∣vah.</HI> Thus, after that the People of God had returned from Babylonish captivity in <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Nehem. 13. 15-22.</NOTE> <HI>Nehemiahs</HI> time, when the Sabbath was profaned, he, as a Magistrate re∣proves and threatens those in <HI>Judah,</HI> whom he saw treading Winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in sheaves, and lading Asses, as also Wine, Grapes and Figs, and all Burdens which they brought into <HI>Jerusalem</HI> on the Sabbath day: And I testified in the day wherein they sold victuals; there dwelt men of <HI>Tyre</HI> also therein, which brought Fish and all manner of ware and sold on the Sabbath unto the Chil∣dren of <HI>Judah</HI> and in <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> Then I, saith he, contended with the Nobles of <HI>Judah</HI> and said unto them, what Evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath-day? Did not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this E∣vil upon us and upon this City? Yet ye bring more wrath upon <HI>Israel</HI> by profan∣ing the Sabbath. Upon this he commands, that, there should no Burden be brought in on the Sabbath day: And when the Merchants and the Sellers of all kind of Ware lodged within <HI>Jerusalem</HI> once or twice, then he testified against them and said unto them, why lodge ye before the Wall? If ye do again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they not on the Sabbath: And he Commanded the <HI>Levites;</HI> that, they should cleanse themselves, and that, they should come to keep the Gates to Sanctifie the Sabbath-day. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2.

Thus standeth the Relation in the weekly succession of daies, which <HI>Aelohim</HI> made to be in the true nature of these Created existences, really whilst the World stands to be instructive unto all mankind of what is his natural will, and mans natural Duty. There was in this Primitive Ordination a full evidence and a convincing Demonstration of <HI>Aelohims</HI> pleasure herein, by his appointing a sufficiencie of light about this matter, both in the Created nature of daies, and of works and Rest re∣spectively in those daies, to give <HI>Adam</HI> to see and know, what he ought to do, what daies to work in, and what day to rest on, and also Innate in <HI>Adam</HI> him∣self for his instruction, thereby discerningly to understand and Faithfully to improve this for the designed end, true use, and proper purposes. Some notions of this Law, as well as of the others of the Ten words, are still retained and kept in man, even though now fallen and in his corrupt state? and renewing Grace doth re∣store in part to the first Created Holiness and Righteousness. <HI>Aelohim</HI> Created <HI>A∣dam</HI> in his own Image: In the Image of <HI>Aelohim</HI> Created he him: And we are to put on the New man which according to God is Created in Righteousness and Holiness of Truth, which is renewed unto knowledge according to the Image of him that Created him. And the whole of this is still in being, carefully, faith∣fully, unalterably preserved, not only by Revelation in the Scriptures of Truth, but also by Primitive Creation and Providential Continuation in the true Nature and in the real Existence of the things themselves. All and every of the daies and Weeks, that have been, are, and will be, since the first Created Week in their or∣dinary revolutions and <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gen. 8. 22. Jerem. 31. 35, 36. &amp; 33. 20, 25.</NOTE> successive courses, are as the daies and week of that one Created week were. At the First Creation was this Law given to <HI>Adam</HI> in respect of his humane Nature and in him given to all the World of Humane Creatures. Even adversaries themselves in their Writings against the seventh-day-Sabbath have confessed, that, the Law given to <HI>Adam</HI> from the beginning is unalterable, and therefore remains still in full force, so that, all men to the Worlds end are bound to yield obedience thereunto: and that the Rest of the seventh-day-Sabbath, was entred into from the Foundation of the World; Christ himself the Creator rested the seventh day from all his works; and that, <HI>Aelohims</HI> resting, on that Se∣venth-day-Sabbath doth necessarily imply Mans Resting on that day as well as Gods

The created nature of it as the se∣venth day, and the cogent reason of it as the Weekly Sabbath-day, not being peculiar to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> but common to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the Command is not proper to one of these only, excluding the other, but doth belong unto both; the LORD's resting on it, which gave such occasion to his Blessing and Sanctify∣ing of it, has an Universal preceptive respect to <HI>Adam</HI> and to his whole Posterity; it is a common Instruction and a general Command unto all men in all ages, to la∣bour in their particular callings, functions, and employments on those six fore-go∣ing days of the Week wherein <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> made the Heavens and the Earth, and to cease and rest from such labour on the seventh-day, because in it He Sab∣batized or rested from all his work: This Law was made and it came with Au∣thority in the beginning of the Created World, and it shall continue and last to the end of the World: <HI>Adam,</HI> the Father of Nations and of Generations, was put under the obligation of it, and so are all his Off-spring from first to last through∣out all Nations in all Generations.

There are still some reliques and remainders, as dark Letters in an old Monument, of those Holy, Just, Good, and spiritual Laws of the Ten Words; still to preserve and keep alive the memory of Man's first created Honour and Dignity, His Rectitude and Uprightness, as also for some other ends, Though those seeds are corrupted now, Natural right reason will teach men, that, see∣ing all men in all Nations do measure their time by Weeks, and their Weeks by seven days, they should (besides what part they separate of their time as due unto God every day,) set apart one whole day of every week unto their Maker, who has allowed them so liberal a portion of time, wherein to provide for them∣selves and for their families: there being no other proportion of time that can so well provide both for the worship and service of God every day, as, E∣vening and Morning of every day; and every week, as the whole Seventh which is the last day: and also for the necessities of all Families, as that which remaineth of the several six fore-going days of the Week: and that is so well fitted to all fun∣ctions and Callings and Employments. There is that in every man, who has the due exercise of his right reason that will directly answer unto this, especially when compared with these created beings, and more especially yet, when having the advantage of Scripture-revelation. The light and law of Nature when cleared up, will tell men, that all mens labour and motion, being in order to <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 10.

Therefore the work of Redemp∣tion is set out by Creation; and for the same reason it is called a renewed Crea∣tion; So is his work of Preservation of, and of Providence over, his creatures. So will his work of Regeneration and of Conversion still be: Thus also his con∣stituting of his Church: Thus also his work of Instauration and of Renovation of the Heavens and of the Earth. This work of first Creation by the creating <HI>Messiah,</HI> is the rule and Standard, the pattern and exemplar, to which all must be brought. It is, as to the final cause thereof, for the glory of <HI>Aelohim;</HI> The glory of Christ, The good of the Elect and of the Believing.

Psa. 8, 6. Heb. 7, 8.</NOTE> Man, as Man. That Sabbath which was thus from the be∣ginning must still stand. The first created Seventh-day-Sabbath is throughout the Scripture most natural, according to the Scripture. This alone, and no other Day is the Sabbath in pure created Nature. This Seventh in order, has the na∣tural name of Sabbath, which the First, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth have not. The creation has a natural order: The several works thereof having been so created in such due order in six distinct days, doth carry that along with it in the very nature and order of their creation, which would convince a na∣tural conscience, exercising right reason, especially when the true information and clear discovery thereof is brought unto him by Scripture-revelation, that, the Creators wisdom doth shine forth in that order, and that this self-evidencing light should be received, entertained, and improved with ready submission to its o∣bliging Law which doth bind such a natural conscience to believe, observe and obey it. The first created time as to the weekly Sabbath was perfected and ap∣pointed in its proper, prime, pure, and natural, Created state: and therefore the created order of the seven days of that one week must still keep their natural Names: and so, the last day of the week and no other, is alone, the seventh-day and the Sabbath-day: Which day then, cannot be altered unto a working-day: <HI>Aelohim</HI>'s Law must still be obeyed and his Example followed whilst Time has duration. To carry the Sabbatizing rest from the seventh to the first day, and the Labouring-service from the first to the seventh-day, is contrary to the pu∣rest Created Nature. There is not a translating either of the Work, or of the Rest from one day of the week to another. <HI>Aelohim</HI> would not have either of these to be separated from his, from their, appointed seasons; It must abide to the End what was thus from the Beginning. What the Holy Law of pure Na∣ture doth confirm, doth remain unmoved through all the Dispensations of Grace, both of the Old and New-Testament-Administration: This doth not destroy that which is pure and perfect in its natural created Being. Scripture and Nature are in Harmonious Concord in this matter. This seventh day is peculiarly sequestred by <HI>Aelohim</HI> for a Sabbath, and has this Preeminence beyond all the rest; the Vote and suffrage of Primitive Nature, doth determine and conclude it to be so. And what is Man, that, he attempts <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Dan. 7. 25. 1 Kin. 12. 32, 33.</NOTE> to change this Time and Law, by a De∣vising of his own heart, and to level this Honorable Day with the rest, seeing it was the Institution of <HI>Aelohim</HI> in the very Forming of Created beings? The Ho∣ly ends whereof, were concreated uses, natural and permanent for this portion of Time; Which seventh day may not therefore be employed about the common ends, uses, and works of the six foregoing days of the Week: Which six days
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
in their order and names have their several distinct Existence, as sense doth plain∣ly demonstrate, by the continued successive courses of Night and Day in their sea∣sons. At the first framing of Nature, the very time it self of the seventh day was on that same day created and made an Holy Rest, and was by Law and San∣ction so declared, The time it self of the seventh-day-Sabbath, As such, was, and is, and will be, That distinct part of Time which was the object of <HI>Aelo∣him</HI>'s blessing and sanctifying of it, as the natural Weekly Sabbath, to be a day of Holy Rest, having Foundation in its own natural Existence. This is ma∣nifestly evidenceable to every rational Man's revived nature; and it is perfectly demonstrable by Scripture-revelation, to every considering Believer, who gives himself impartially to understand the substance and the end of <HI>Aelohim</HI>'s creating of such a separated determinate portion of Time. This is the true Doctrine and the Genuin meaning of the Weekly-Sabbath: Man and this seventh-day-Sabbath being created in one and the same week, will be coeval whilst Weeks do last, They will live and stand together. The fittedness of this Day was a Creating-Act: The reason of which Day is of natural self-Manifestation and Obligation, in which we are confirmed by Word-revelation. This is the prime Make of it, having its first rise with Created Nature, and so is Perpetual, and unchange∣ably fixed, An Individual-Sabbath-day, untransferrable to any other Day of the Week: Sabbath-day and seventh-day are Connatural and Reciprocal. Sab∣bath-worship and service must be done on the <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Numb. 28. 9, 10.</NOTE> Day thereof. All days of the week are not of equal accompt with God; neither have they the same Honour. Christ Himself hath put the Crown upon the Head of the Seventh-day; and so let it en∣joy its sole and lasting Royal Dignity; It having a concreated Excellingness which will be, and abide with it, through the duration of the World. A Primitive Con∣stitution that must stand firm. <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2, 3. Exod. 5. 13, 19. Lev. 23. 37. 1 King. 8. 59. Ezek. 24. 2.</NOTE> It is a distinct day and has a distinct word for it. Thus let the Scriptural compleat Journal, and its perfect Diary of that one Cre∣ated Week, in seven distinct days remain in its unmoveable Order. And now, if this Argument drawn from pure Primitive Created Nature be convincing and de∣monstrative, let that Great Ratiocinator call to mind his Expressions, I can con∣sent, saith he, that all They take the seventh-day for the Sabbath, who can prove it to be by meer natural evidence: and in another place he thus writes, This is the very hinge of all our Controversie, For, if this be once proved, we shall ea∣sily consess that it (he speaks of the Seventh-day-sabbath,) is not abrogated: For, Christ came not to abrogate any Law of Nature. And further he writes, That the great Laws of nature, containing Man's Duty to God, resulting from and manifested in our nature, As related to God, and in the nature of things or the works of God, was still made the chief part of the Redeemer's Law. So that this Law of nature, whose sum is the love of God and of his Image, is ever the Primitive unchangeable Law. No title of this shall ever cease, if Nature cease not. The seventh-day thus speaks for it self and has its Creator and his word cogently pleading for it. No other day of the week, either in name or in nature, is the Seventh-day: The order of the Days is sensible from the first to the se∣venth. He, that can tell the days, and knows their number, understandeth, that, there must six go before in the same week, ere he can come to the seventh: A day, which cannot be lost by all Mankind: Will any apprehend that, all and e∣very of reasonable creatures have out slept just one whole day or more, whereby this accompt is disturbed? What colour is there for such an apprehension, And if, for Disputes sake, such a groundless supposition were admitted, yet the Day if tho∣rowly searched after would recover its ancient right. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">See the Au∣thor of Cos∣mical Suspici∣ons, <HI>pag.</HI> 19, 20.</NOTE> Exact Astronomers have observed, that, natural days are not all of equal length, whatever the vulgar of Philosophers have supposed to the contrary. Let those improve their skill to advance this great secret in Created Nature with a particular eye unto the seventh-day-Sabbath; Which alone should put a deciding end unto this Controversie. Yet in regard this Thwart-over-Generation of vain affecters of Humane Wisdom doth expect some further accompt of this Matter by way of Argument unto Men, (although I bottom my judgment and practise upon Scripture-Revelation and Created Nature:) Let me present the Reader with somewhat of Expostulation, and of reasoning the Case, with such as do importunately call for it.

the year of the World began. Let them look to their proof, but, according to that, I observe the seventh day from the Creation. So <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Act 12. 4. is mis-translated, It should be <HI>Passover,</HI> for <HI>Easter.</HI> There is this passage in a Querie of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First concerning <HI>Easter,</HI> propounded to the Parliaments Com∣missioners at <HI>Holmby, April</HI> 23. 1647. I conceive, saith he, the celebration of this Feast (of <HI>Easter)</HI> was insti∣tuted by the same authority, which changed the Jewish Sabbath into the Lords day, or <HI>Sunday:</HI> For, it will not be found in Scripture, where <HI>Satur∣day</HI> is discharged to be kept, or turn∣ed into the <HI>Sunday:</HI> Wherefore it must be the Churches authority that chang∣ed the one and instituted the other: Therefore my opinion is, that, those who will not keep this Feast, may as well return to the observation of <HI>Sa∣turday,</HI> and refuse the weekly <HI>Sunday.</HI> When any body can shew me, that herein I am in an error, I shall not be a shamed to confess, and amend it, till when you know my mind, <HI>C. R. Hesychius</HI> calls the first day of the Week another Sabbath-day. So in the Council of <HI>Friuli,</HI> the first day is called <HI>Sabbatum primum,</HI> as the Se∣venth day is <HI>Sabbatum ultimum, Con∣cil. Foro juliense. cap.</HI> 13. So <HI>Ambrose</HI> in Psal. 37. So <HI>Scaliger</HI> of the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Christians, they call both of them, the Seventh day and the First day, by the name of Sabbaths. Thus Doctor <HI>Ʋsher</HI> in his Letter to Dr. <HI>Twiss</HI> publish∣ed by Dr. <HI>Bernard, page</HI> 88, 89.</NOTE> <HI>Easter-week</HI> (Thus do men heathenishly mis-name days, and weeks, and months, and years) is by all such understood to be that week, whereof <HI>Easter-day,</HI> the <HI>Sunday,</HI> is the first, and so they reckon afterwards, the first <HI>Sunday</HI> after <HI>Easter-week,</HI> the second <HI>Sunday,</HI> and so on. So <HI>Whitsunday∣week,</HI> begins that week with <HI>Whitsunday.</HI> And after∣wards <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> the first, second, and so forth, <HI>Sunday</HI> after <HI>Trinity:</HI> Thus they observe the times for the keeping of their Sessions. Do not dead Monuments and Tomb-stones keep alive the memory of the days of the Week, when they have often engraved upon them that par∣ticular day of the Week when such or such a one dyed, or was buried, or had his Epitaph and Monument erected? Do not Engravings at some Fountains, and Springs speak this, where the Owners have Recorded some known day of the week upon the Head-stones? So also some Bounda∣ry stones or Mark-stones.

Do not Historians keep this Truth Company with their Judgment? For a thousand years and upward, say some, when we meet with Sabbath in any Writer, of what name soever, it must be understood of no other day than this seventh-day: So those whom they call the Antient Fathers, generally style this last day of the Week, Sabbath. Are not Synods, Councils, and Canons, of one and the same mind in this? Do not the Records of this <HI>English</HI> Nation fully agree in this? Many particular Instances of the seventh-days being called the Sabbath being to be found, as those who are ver∣sed in those Histories do inform, in the King's Exchequer, in the Common-Pleas, in the King's-Bench, Chancery, Chequer-Chamber, and those of the house of Lords, which is one of the Highest Courts of Record in this Kingdom; all retaining the name of the day of Sabbath for the seventh-day, This being the common phrase in the Courts of <HI>Westminster:</HI> and the <HI>Latin</HI> processes do run in this style; which is known to all observing Lawyers, Sheriffs, Atturneys, Clerks and Solicitors. Are not Tenures of Lands and of Estates Witnesses of this, which are held conditionally upon paying or doing such a sum or such a thing upon such or such a day of the week, whereby the number and order of Days cannot be lost? Do not Conveyances, Copies, Leases, Deeds, concurr in this; Which do specify some particular known day? Do not Commissions to Judges and to other Officers meet with this sense by their Dates? Do not Char∣ters to Corporations express some special day of Grants? Are not Fairs and Markets held upon certain days of the week, agreeing with the present Accompt, as the reckoning now is? Search the records of Marriages, Nativities, Deaths, Burials, in Ecclesiastical Register-books, and is not the memory of Days pre∣served there?

Sufficient to me is Scrip∣ture Authority, warranted in created Nature.</P>
<P>Having now gone thorow my great Task and undertaking in asserting and pro∣ving, thorow the whole Scriptures by <HI>Aelohim</HI>'s own assigned Reasons, by other Scripture Arguments, and by Created Nature and Established Order, the Se∣venth-day, which is the last day of the week to be the Weekly Sabbath-day, should not every Mouth be stopped from gain-saying of it? Yet the plainests, clear∣est Truths have been opposed, and so is this: Some rise up against it, and ob∣ject, that, no special Honour is put by the LORD and by his Word upon the se∣venth day, more than upon any other day, of the week, and that, it is but A seventh, not The seventh; And that, that part of time, that is and will be ac∣cepted with God is declared and determined to be the seventh part of it, or one day in seven: and that, one day in seven hath and must have a natural priority unto the seventh-day, because, say such, the seventh day is one of the seven; Whereas such should have more deliberately considered, that one day of seven was not before the seventh day in order of time: It could not be truly affirmed of any one day, that it was one of seven before the seventh day was Created. For, when the one day was so named, there was but that one day; so but two on the second day; but three on the third day, but four on the fourth, but five on the fifth, but six on the sixth day, till the seventh had its natural Existence, and its created being; and untill then no one of the fore-going days of the Week could be called one in seven: For, till then there were not seven: and the seventh day is the last number of days, and the only seventh in the days of the Week. So that, here is a stop made, and we go no further for∣ward, As to the natural created Order and accompt of a Week, and therefore that exception and objection, which some do bring in against this from ten Lambs, any of which may be the tenth according as they may run out, is nothing perti∣nent and applicable to the present matter; For, the days of every week do not run voluntarily at their pleasure which can be before or behind as they will, to go backward or forward when they list, but, they keep their created order in this successive continued weekly course by a well-established natural, unalterable Law: although in the exception and objection, this should be noted, that, when the ten Lambs were run out; they had each distinct names, and the last was the only tenth, and no other but the last. That particular day of the week is the Weekly Sabbath-day, which alone (As to this of the weekly-Sabbath) has proper marks of Note and of Honour put upon it, As <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s own peculiar day, which he has culled out from all the rest of the days of the week for his created ends and instituted purposes: There is not any one Insignificant word or letter in the whole Book of God; All that he has spoken and given to his people is of good use. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>c.</HI> Matt. 5. 17; 18, 19.

For which end also, there is this Empha∣tic-Article <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 13.</NOTE> prefixed before the Sixth day in order of time, which doth in that place Demonstrate, that, as the work of that Sixth day was somewhat more re∣markable, and that, <HI>Aelohim</HI> has perfected all the Works which he propounded and purposed to Create in the foregoing Six daies of this one week of the Created World, shewing a thing known and Signally illustrious and commendable: So al∣so, that, that day only was the Sixth day in the Weekly revolution, and no o∣ther day, and that the Weekly Sabbath must be reckoned in order of Created time the immediately next succeeding after that Sixth; which was the seventh day, the last day in the week.

It is the Duty of Created Man to look well to this, that, the Seventh-day-Sabbath be not forgotten by him, but duly re∣membred in Order to the Glorifying of <HI>Jehovah:</HI> This special Mark is put upon this day to distinguish it from all and every of the other daies of the Week, to note the Importance of it, and to signify the Antiquity of it: It being as old, of as Antient constitution as the very first Week of this Created World, which <HI>Aelahim</HI> did expresly command to be observed, as a distinct, separate Sanctifyed day; it being the Last day in the Week: And therefore his people have need to remember it, that, when the time did come about in its Weekly returns, it might not be forgotten and neglected, as neither its natural Equity. There being the same Reasons now as ever; which the Lawgiver himself has repeated and revived in the Fourth word or Command; which doth set out the weight of this precept and the necessity of Mans obedience unto it. The Three former Commandements or words of the First Table, are much in order unto this, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 8. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> it is the Infinitive mood.</NOTE> to Remember the Seventh-day-Sabbath: For, if this be not kept Holy, those Foregoing three will be broken; as Scripture and experience doth prove.

There might be a large enumeration of many particular words in He∣brew, which are of common universal use, such as no institute, custom, or con∣sent of men has imposed upon things, but, created Nature it self by a secret instinct and impulse has assigned to and imprinted on real beings, thus, as to the present case this Hebrew letter, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Heh, doth take its name from that gesture which ge∣nerally all mankind do express when they do demonstrate a person or thing, <HI>Hea, Hin, Hinnea</HI> in Hebrew; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greek, <HI>En, Ecoe,</HI> in Latin: As, when, we see a Man that has <HI>Hou,</HI> in Hebrew that is, Substance, Wealth, Riches, we crie with some admiration. <HI>Ha, Ho</HI> or <HI>Hah,</HI> there goes such a Rich Man, and we are ready to point him out with a Finger, for that doth please such Men when they are so no∣ted by others. The Demonstrative Letter is Consignificative, and is not idle in the beginning of those words, but doth Super-add a certain signification to them. What colour of Reason can there be to exclude the Notificativeness here: This be∣ing a word or Command so express, so weighty, so significant, with such an A∣wakening word set at the beginning of it, and there being such need, that, <HI>Jehovahs</HI> Instituted time for his Weekly-Sabbath-worship be determinately fixed and cer∣tainly known?

by a diligent search, but, take up things over credulously, upon trust with∣out tryal? As this Learned man is an Opposer of those prefixes in the Hebrew, so also of the Prepositive Articles in the Greek, as if these also were sometimes Re∣dundant, thereby Insinuating, that, it is so in this case: Whereas there is much of significancy in those, which are Emphatical, and Deictical, noting some cer∣tain thing in a Limited sense not indefinitely. That the prepositive Articles in the Greek are not insignificantly redundant, but demonstratively Emphatical, is an assertion capable of clear proof: As also, that, they are so in this particular Case; relating to the Seventh-day-Sabbath, as I have already discovered: And I am now to give it forth to the Reader in some other Cases.

As for the particular Instances in Scripture, which this learned man doth give, where he Judgeth this Note and prefix of demonstration to be redundant without assign∣ing any the least Reason why he so deemeth, I have examined every one of them and find them to be Notificative: Of which I shall give the Reader some short ac∣count. His first instance is in one of the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Psal. 1. 4.</NOTE> Psalms, where those wicked ones spo∣ken of are evidently pointed out to be the same prvaricating-wickedly-revolting∣ones that are expresly set out in a <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 1.</NOTE> former verse of the same Psalm. So that, the note is Anaphorical, designing such persons, of whom mention was made before, being opposed unto those who must withdraw from them, if they would make hap∣py progresses, or Blessed goings on with a strait foot; which is the sweet signifi∣cancy of the <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> First word in that Psalm: Those wicked ones are fingered out to be such, whose Counsels are very bad, whose way is so greatly erring, and whose seat is so full of Scorn, such an accursed race of Profane ones, as of all sorts of sin∣ners shall be left unfruitful and fading, Chased away and condemned. And least the learned man should think I am alone in this matter, besides the self evidence of it upon the very place, I refer him in the Margin <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Avenari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>'s Hebrew grammer pag. 167. where he interprets this place, shewing that, the Nomina∣tive-Case doth sometimes call to it the demonstrative <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. to set out the Emphaticalness, as Ps. 1. <HI>Hare∣shagnim, Impii Illi,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> So <HI>Bythner</HI> on Ps. 1. 1. 4, doth twice express it, <HI>Hareshagnim, Isti improbi.</HI> and again, <HI>Hareshagnim, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lli Impro∣bi.</HI> and a third time under the 33 Rule of his <HI>Lingua <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruditorum, Ha∣reshagnim, Illi Impii.</HI> Consult also for this, the Harmony of <HI>Oriental Tongues</HI> by <HI>Johan.

His next instance is in <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Eccles. 2, 14.</NOTE> <HI>Ecclesiastes;</HI> where, unto a seriously Con∣sidering, and a deeply-pondering-mind. The Notificative∣prefixes do manifestly set out the Opposition and difference that is between an Eminently wise man, and one notoriously foolish, with respect to that particular-subject-matter there in hand. There is one, of such a raised sort of wise men, in such an elevated degree, as his movings are more in the Light he is such a one as has his Eyes in his Head, as sees his way plain before him, one circumspect and heedfull in his goings, one wary and watchful in his steps; One that has and keeps his eyes open, and walks in the light of Holy Scripture, and of Spiritual illumination, holding on with an even strait Foot, foreseeing and forecasting as he passeth along: To which other Scriptures do <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">compare Deuter. 16. 19. with Exod. 23. 8.</NOTE> agree, setting out a Wise Walker by one that hath his eyes open to choose and mind his way, that, he may not mistake and wander, or stumble and fall. There are also two Pronoun Affixes which do further Demonstrate this. And the Opposition doth set out a Foolish one, of all Fools one of the veriest Fools, an inconstant Fool, who walks in darkness either not using his eyes, but winking, and shutting his eyes, when Light is before him, or taking a time to walk in when it is dark, so that he cannot find out the right way. A rash inconsiderate Fool, that knows not whither he goes, nor at what he stumbles. Besides the proverbial Antithesis here, doth declare and commend the excellingness and Preference of the wise man above and beyond the Fool. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Mercer</HI> upon this place. Eccles. 2. 14.</NOTE> The Hebrews and Chaldees do set out an especial part of wisdom in Cir∣cumspection, when the eyes in the Head are deligently used: As Folly doth no∣tably manifest it self in heedless walking. The last instance is in <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Levit. 18. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Leviticus,</HI> where there is the notificative prefix put before <HI>Adam;</HI> which as the English Reader may find, the Dutch Annotations in English do express, that man which doth the same shall live by them.

None but <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> hath Authority to determine and to appoint this weekly Sabbath-day.

(They, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1. King. 12. 33, 34. Dan. 7. 25.

One of the great opposers of the weekly seventh-day-Sabbath doth yet grant; that Rest in the first notion of it doth include a respect to an Antecedent work or labour: And that, it is so e∣very where declared: And that, it is vain to imagine the World was made in Six daies, and those closed with a day of Rest, without an especiall respect unto the obedience of rational Creatures. Hereby then man in general was taught o∣bedience and working, before he entered into rest: For, being Created in the Image of God, he was to conform himself to God. As God wrought before he rested, so was he to work before his Rest▪ Thus he. How then can the first day of the week be now the Resting day of that week, where the Rest is made to go before the work and labour? This being contrary to Greated Nature? And it being a part of mans natural Created Image of <HI>Aelohim</HI> to conform unto him in working before Resting in the same week. Meditation on the works as well as on the word of Christ, and on Christ himself, is a necessary useful duty. And how can this be performed in its right proper place, where the Sabbath is carried from the seventh to any other day of the week, (as for instance,) to the First day? For, this Computation would put the Seventh day back to the sixth day, the Sixth to the Fifth day, the Fifth to the Fourth day, the Fourth to the Third day, the third to the Second day, the Second to the First day, and it would set the First day for∣ward to the Seventh; quite inverting the order of the Creation, and so would engage a man on the First day which was and is a working day; to meditate on a Sabbath-days priviledge, and on the Creators Resting, and mans Resting, which was upon another day, the seventh which is the last day of the week; and on the Seventh day, which by this wrong account is misreckoned the Sixth. It would put a man upon meditating on the work of the Sixth day, whereas, it was Crea∣ted and appointed the Resting-day. Thus every day would be set out of its due place: And hence it is, that, such multitudes of namers of the Name of Christ do so little understand, what the particular Created works of every day in the week are; and so seldom meditate upon the peculiar works of their proper day. Whereas, when the seventh day closeth the week with a Sabbath day, a day of Rest which is most natural, then <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Compare Psal. 104. throughout with Psal. 98. title with the rest of that Psalm. &amp; Gen. 1. throughout, with ch. 251, 2, 3.</NOTE> Meditation passeth naturally into Created or∣der; as to working, and as to Resting.

<P>Having thus far attended the Weekly-seventh-day-Sabbath in its strait-footed walk in a plain path, through the whole Scripture, there thwarts the Reader now, a straying company that would perswade him to get into another way along with them, the way of the first day, as the weekly-Sabbath, as if this were now the New-Testament-Dispensation. And for this, they would have him to consider these <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Mat. 28. 1. Mark. 16. 2. Lu. 24, 1. Joh. 20. 1, 19. Act. 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2. Rev. 1. 10.

<P>Before I return an express direct Answer to the several particular Scriptures themselves, I advise the Reader, to ask these Transferrers of the Weekly-Sab∣bath-day, from the seventh to the first day of the week, when they judg it was, that, the first day of the week began to be the weekly Sabbath-day? Most will say that it began on the particular day of Christ's Resurrection, by Christ him∣self: Some few will assert, that, it was a little after that Resurrection, by the A∣postles of Christ: but all of them will acknowledge, that, it was before any part of the New-Testament was written. It being so then, let the Reader im∣prove this last Concession, and further demand of these men, if one of the A∣postles, as <HI>Peter</HI> by name, for Supposition, had preached up this Doctrine, that, the Weekly Sabbath-day under the New-Testament-Administration of Grace, was translated and changed from the Seventh, which is the last day of Week, to the first day of the week; and that, one of the Hearers had asked <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> upon what Scripture do you bottom this Doctrine? How are, whatsoever words of God were heretofore written, Profitable, and written for such a Do∣ctrine? What Answer do these Men imagine, that <HI>Peter</HI> could have returned? The New Testament was not then written, and all the Scriptures which they then had, were the Writings of the Old Testament: Those of <HI>Moses</HI> and of the Prophets: This Hearer searcheth these and can meet with no such thing, in the Preceptive, or Prophetical, or Promissary, part of that Word, neither could any other refer him to clear-convincing-proofs of this. How then could this Man be well satisfied, that, this was True Doctrine, when he could not find it in his Bible; but the quite contrary all the Old Testament through, another day, the Seventh in order of Created Time all along Commanded and commend∣ed! And if this Hearer should further have asked <HI>Peter,</HI> If I should work upon the seventh-day contrary to the Precept in the Law, what Scriptures would bear me out in so doing, when I appear before the righteous Judg, who has in so many Words forbid this, and so often, in all the Scriptures that I have, which speak of this thing? and if I do not observe the first day as the Weekly-Sabbath-day, but do work on that day having <HI>Aelohim</HI>'s Command and Example for it, what Scriptures have you by which to reprove me? After this Arguing, what could <HI>Peter</HI> have replyed to this, from Old-Testament-Scripture? I leave the Reader further to improve this in his Study and Meditation. For, the Christianized be∣lievers did search the Scriptures, whether those things which the Apostles of Christ taught them, were so or not, even in the Case <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Act. 17. 2, 3, 11. and 28. 23. and 26. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> of <HI>Paul</HI> himself; who was one of the most Eminent, and most used of them all.</P>
<P>I shall now in the supplies of the Spirit of Holiness, according to the word of

No Translation of Scripture is any further the Word of God, than it doth exactly agree with the Original. Those who do translate these words, the first day of the week, do borrow a Phrase, which is meerly Tal∣mudical, and not Scriptural, and it is Invented by Men, not grounded upon the Word of God. As the words themselves, in their own sense are not at all, either against the Weekly seventh-day-Sabbath, or for the first day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath now, which is the Common pretence, and the mistaken Plea: So neither is the meaning of them in any of those places, as they are Construed in <HI>Syntax,</HI> standing in the coherence of the Text, or as compared with other Scriptures.

There is one Opposer of the weekly seventh-day-Sabbath, who to establish his first day in the room of the seventh, doth urge, <HI>Levit.</HI> 23. 39. where the eight day is called a Sabbath, which he affirmeth from <HI>John</HI> 7. 37. to be the last day, the Great day of that Feast of Tabernacles, from whence he would infer a first day Sabbath. Where∣as, there were but seven days in that Feast, <HI>Deuter.</HI> 16. 13, 15. Besides, that Feast of Tabernacles or of Booths, was not a weekly Feast, and so cannot have a weekly Antitype directly answering to it: The weekly Sabbath was spoken of before, and settled upon the seventh day, <HI>Levit.</HI> 23. 3.</P>
<P>A Learned Adversary of the seventh-day-Sabbath doth acknowledge, that, about the time of the writing of the Books of the New Testament, both the <HI>Jews</HI> themselves, and all the Heathen, which took notice of all these Feasts and solemn Assemblies did call them Sabbaths, and not only so, But by God him∣self, from their Analogie, which I shall have further occasion after a few leaves, to make some use of. In <HI>Luk.</HI> 6. 1-10. compared with <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 1-14. we may read of Sabbaths in the <HI>Plural number</HI> (as in many other places) of the First Sabbath, a second Sabbath, another Sabbath; which if they be applyed to the Sabbaths of either of the Typical Feasts, then it is an evident proof, that, the days of those feasts had the name of Sabbaths in the Scripture if they refer the expressions to the weekly Sabbaths, then it doth afford a testimony for the Weekly seventh-day-Sabbath. Upon one of these Sabbaths our LORD Jesus Christ did arise from the Dead. And now let the Considering-Reader bethink himself, whether this do give any the least intimation of any Change of the weekly-Sabbath, from the seventh to the first day of the week? Where nothing either in the words themselves, or in the Coherence or Context, or design of those Scriptures, or expressed or implyed or intended sense of them, doth meddle at all with any change of the Weekly-Sabbath? Where there is no, either Blessing or Sanctifying, either Name or Thing; either Institution or separation, either Command or promise relating to the first day of the Week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, under the New-Testa∣ment-Administration. Yet notwithstanding all this so clear and express, which is either not understood, or not pondered, men rise up against it, to the troubling of us, and to disturb us if they could in our seventh-day-Sabbath, of weekly Rest: For say they, The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word for <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>One,</HI> hath sometimes the sense of <HI>First;</HI> and the New Testament doth Hebraize in this particular: that, if the sense were one of the Sabbaths, then the word should be in the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Neuter Gender,</HI> not in the <HI>Feminin,</HI> to agree with its <HI>Substantive,</HI> which is of the <HI>Neuter Gender:</HI> and that, it is expresly said <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Mar. 16. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> in one place, the first of the Week, which word is never used for One, but First or Chief.

these is as followeth; As for the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word which doth properly signify <HI>One,</HI> What satisfying reason can there be given why any other Tralatitious sense should be assigned to it in these particular places which have so plain and familiar, so obvious and pertinent, a sense in their propriety of meaning, where these Objectors would have it bear such a sense, as that of <HI>First?</HI> I shall examine the places usually alledged after a few Lines more: Or if it could be evidenced, that, in some one place it be convenient to translate it <HI>First,</HI> what cogencie of Inference can there be drawm from thence, that therefore it must be so in the <HI>Greek</HI> word, in the Scriptures fore-quoted? What necessity doth there appear of this? Where the Circumstances of the Text do so well and fitly admit of such a rendring, interpretation, and construction, of the Original Words, as is according to their true certain and proper signification, which has been already Demonstrated? What satisfactory-spiritual-convincing-Reason is there, to fasten such an Interpretation upon them in the Translation, as gives them a sense impro∣per and a meaning unusual; to which no necessity doth urge and drive either the Translator or the Annotator? Words are to be understood according to the pro∣priety of them, unless we be otherways unavoidably forced by some evident Absur∣dity? Of which there is no Colourable appearing shew here. How can con∣vincing Demonstrations and Infallible Conclusions be drawn from Scripture-ex∣pressions, if a contrary liberty be assumed and granted? Why should we yield our selves to flee to a pretended double <HI>Hebraism,</HI> of One for First, and of Sabbaths for Week; where the plainness and expressness of the Letter, and the Propriety and significancy of the Words, is so Consistent with, and adapted to, the Con∣text and the Analogy and Harmony of other Scriptures upon that Subject-mat∣ter? I would know yet further of these men, whether the Evening of the Sab∣baths mentioned <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 1. did belong to that which they call the First day of the Week, or not? If they judg not, then they go quite contrary to all the Scriptural-Accompt, which doth begin the day at Evening. If they acknow∣ledg it to belong to that Day, then I further enquire, how, when that Even∣ing and the Day-part which belonged to it, when these were over and gone, How it could be said of the Evening next following of this Day, <HI>John</HI> 20. 19. that, it was the Evening on the same First-day of the Week, as they mis-inter∣pret it?

Christ appearing to be standing before <HI>Mary,</HI> Christ having been arisen from the Dead, sometime before that. For, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Joh. 20. 1▪ 18.</NOTE> there passed some time between Christ's Actual Arising, and this appearing. <HI>Mary</HI> had been at the Se∣pulchre before this, while it was yet Dark, and Christ was arisen then, She found not her LORD there, whereupon she ran and gave an accompt to <HI>Peter,</HI> and came about again, remaining a while at the Sepulchre, having some confer∣ence with the Angels and with Christ himself a while before she knew Him. <HI>Mary</HI> came <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Mar. 16. 2.</NOTE> very much in the Morning: So that, Christ's standing before <HI>Mary,</HI> points out, not his first Minute of arising, but his time of appearing to her. Sabbath here being in the <HI>Singular Number</HI> one particular distinct <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is added to <HI>Sab∣bath,</HI> in John 19. 31.</NOTE> Sab∣bath-day of those Paschal-Sabbaths forespoken of, and therefore cannot be a pro∣per supply to <HI>First,</HI> For, then it must run thus, The First day of the Sabbath: Whereas This Sabbath was it self a Day. Here in the Way how groundless and Scriptureless is the Conjecture of that Advocate for the First day-Sabbath, who from hence, to wit, Christ's time of arising, as he judgeth it, would date the beginning of the First days pretended Holy Rest, to be the Morning of the First day of the week, and to last but from Morning till the Evening, making the Night-part to be no part of the weekly-Sabbath, and as having no place in the spiritual Rest of the Gospel to be expressed on this day, (the First day, he speaks of) nor to be any thing distinguished from the Night of other Days of the week! So writes a Learned Man. Thus we have a kind of half Holy-day set up by a Man in the room of an whole Seventh-days-weekly-Sabbath, Created and Instituted by <HI>Jehovah Aelohim.</HI> But, what part of Time shall we reckon that Night-time to? It must belong either to Working-day, or Sabbath-day? If to Sabbath-day-time, then it is a part of the time of a Sabbath-day: If to Work∣ing-day-time, then we have more time than Six Working-days in one Week, which is contrary to Scripture-revelation, and to Created Nature. For, the Evening is as Natural to the Created Days as the Morning. The Creator Him∣self did some of his works in the Night. As <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 2.</NOTE> Particularly, He created Dark∣ness in the beginning of the Evening of the one Day, in the first Week of the created World, and the night-part of every one of the Large days: and it is the Commendation of a <HI>Virtuosa-</HI>Woman, that, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Prov. 31. 15, 18.</NOTE> she and her Houshold do work some part of the Night; Whereas we are expresly forbid to do any Work of our particular Functions on the Seventh-day-Sabbath: all that kind of work is supposed to be done on the six foregoing days of the Week: and I have before shewed, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>pag.</HI> 110. to <HI>pag.</HI> 120. of this treatise.</NOTE> that, the Night-part, as well as the Day-part belongs to the Weekly Sabbath-day. And how doth this Assertion of that learned Man agree with another Affirmation of his, so often repeated in that Book of his, that, That part of Time, that is and will be accepted with God, is declared and determined in the Fourth Commandment to be the seventh part of it, or one day in seven! If so, Then how can this Learned Man and his Followers in This, well groundedly expect Acceptance with God; When the seventh-part of Time is not observed, as the Weekly-Sabbath; but one half of that Seventh part is cut off by him: quite contrary unto what God has declared and determined in the Fourth Commandment! This incoherence and inconsistence doth bewray the Darkness and doubtfulness that is upon the Minds and Hearts of the most Learned Opposers of the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. What will become of <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Laws and Prescriptions, if Men take such an Unwarranted Liberty, at one blow to cut off the half of the Weekly-Sabbath, contrary to the LORD's Appointments, and contrary too, unto their own Concessions and Assertions, especially also, when on this piece of a pretended Sabbath they give such a Loose to carnal Hearts, as to leave any to be a Rule unto themselves for their words, works, and actions upon this half part of a day of Rest? as if all others were Men of a Legal Spirit, and were Judaizing Sabbatizers, that will be exact ac∣cording to the Scripture-rules of the good old way in these Matters: Who sees not what an Unscriptural liberty even good men will be too prone to allow themselves, if once they apprehend, that, this is referred unto themselves to judg Determi∣nately of? <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Isai. 56. 1. 8. &amp; 58. 12, 13, 14.

Judged by the Word? Here again, My heart would be at work in sweet thoughts, and in raised affections towards a dear Redeemer, who has done and suffered so much for his unworthy Creature, that, my Heart and Head and Hand may cease a while from giving answering Solutions to Fallacious arguings. O how full, how sutable, a good is here! Thou who readest this, canst thou truly say, this Redeemer is my Redeemer; this Mediator hath loved me, and hath given himself for me? Redemption is wrought out and finished by Christ for me! He will perfect it in me as well as for me! All the just demands of the Fa∣ther are fully satisfied by the Son of His love! In the vertue of his Satisfaction and Intercession I will go to the Father and expect Audience and Assistance, Ac∣ceptance and a Blessing O how well will it go with them and with their Cause, who have Christ for their Advocate? How sure is that Covenant of Grace, which hath Christ for the Surety!</P>
<P>The Reader now may expect, that, I say something to that part of the Ob∣jection which doth suppose the work of Redemption to have been finished on the day of Christ's Resurrection. So that, He being then Gloriously Manifested to have Rested from it, the Objectors think, that Christ might have good cause to Honour the First day of the Week above any other day, as the Weekly-Sabbath-day.</P>
<P>Here is Mens Thinking and Reasoning, but the serious Inquirer doth look for Christ's Instituting and Commanding, which he can never find in the Word, as to the First-days being the Weekly Sabbath-day. Redemption in the whole and in all and every of the parts of it, and in all and every of the Fruits and effects of it, I beleivingly confess, praise, and apply, according to those growing measures of Scripture light, and of saving Graces, which the LORD hath graciously given me therein about this. Both those great works of <HI>Jehovah-</HI>Christ, Creation-work and Redemption-work, are highly to be valued; and one of them should not be set against the other, let them both be brought in, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2, 3. Exod. 20. 1. 2, 8, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> Creation-work, and Redemption work too, as proper matter for Meditation, conference and Praise, whereby the Seventh-day-Sabbath may be, Celebrated and Sanctifyed in the Weekly returns of it. The observation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Seventh-day-Sabbath is inforced by the Lawgiver himself to be kept holy to <HI>Je∣hovah</HI> by an argument drawn <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11.

<P>The adversary being driven out of this hold, seeks refuge for his First day Sab∣bath in some other Scriptures, cited in the <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">John 20. 19. 26. Luke 24. 13-36. Acts 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2.</NOTE> Margin, (which yet will not allow him Countenance and Warrant.) For, say they, the good Apostles met on the First day, the day of Christs Resurrection, which they then observed as the week∣ly-Sabbath-day, in memory of his Resurrection, and of his compleating the works of Redemption on that day; Christ taught the two Disciples on that day of his Rising, on the same day he appeared to the Disciples, and instructed them, and did eat with them, thus assembled, and Blessed them! The next First day of the week he chose to appear to them again: And those Apostles Christ did Commis∣sion as his principal Church Ministers to teach the Churches all his Doctrine, and to deliver them all his Commands and orders, and so to settle and guide the first Churches: Which Apostles did actually separate and appoint the First day of the week for Holy Worship especially in Church-assemblies; They themselves fre∣quently meeting upon that day, for that end; and enjoyning the Churches of their Plantation so to do, who obeyed them in this: The First day is mentioned as the day of the Disciples assembling to break Bread (which though they did it oft: on other daies, yet no day else was peculiarly appointed for it.) Disciples and belie∣vers at Christian-assemblies were not to come empty on the first day of the week, but were on that day to deposite what they brought in to the Treasury of the Church. And this has been the practice of all the Christian Churches in the World, since the Apostles daies: For which there is the Evidence of Church∣history in this matter of Fact, into which Humane Authority this must be resolved: For this evidence of this Churches Vniversal constant usage is a full and sufficient proof of the matter of Fact: That, the First day was set apart by the Apostles for Holy worship, especially in the publick Church assemblies. They that will de∣ny the Validity of this Historical evidence do by consequence betray the Christian Faith, or give away or deny the necessary means of proving the truth of it, and of many great particulars of Religion; For, without this Historical evidence we cannot make good the Authority of any one single verse or text of Scripture, which we shall alledg, because, we are not certain of that particular Text, (or words) whether it have been altered or added, or corrupted by the Fraud of the Here∣ticks, or the partiality of some Christians; or the oversight of Scribes, &amp;c. thus these objecters. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">1.

<PB N="42" REF="26"/>
there is express mention made both of the feast of unleavened Bread, which was the Passover-Feast, in the verse immediately going before the place cited; and also of Pentecost in nine verses after relating to that season in the same year; within the compass of which two Feasts inclusively, were seven Sabbaths, upon one of which that meeting was of <HI>Paul</HI> with the Disciples: Which doth hold forth a clear Truth, contrary to what it is alledged for. As for what <HI>Paul</HI> did more af∣ter that Sabbath day was over, at the going in of the Sun, when another day came on, which was meerly occasional, he being in a preparedness to depart on the next day after the Sabbath: Such as <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Acts 20. 7-12.</NOTE> his continuing of his speech till mid∣night, his raising up <HI>Eutychus,</HI> his eating of Brèad, his talking with them a long while, even till break of day, then departing: So long Preaching and con∣ference all the Night long is not to be enforced as a necessary Sabbath-duty, the Scriptures no where so enjoyning it, and if this objector would assert it, so far at least as till the midnight, (according to his account of an whole day in <HI>England</HI> from midnight to midnight, which I have shewn in this treatise to be no right reckoning, but contrary to the word of truth:) Let him and the other learned man whom I answered but a little before, who shuts out the night-part from be∣ing any part of the weekly-Sabbath-day, let them I say, if they can find no bet∣ter work for their time, contend about that matter. This Night-part belonging to the after day-part, as making up the whole next day after the Sabbath, was not observed by <HI>Paul</HI> as the weekly-Sabbath: for you may <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Acts. 20 13, 14.</NOTE> there Read how some of the Disciples went before to ship, and sayled to <HI>Assos,</HI> there intending to take in <HI>Paul:</HI> For, so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot: And when he met with them at <HI>Assos</HI> they took him in, and came to <HI>Mytilene:</HI> this was no Weekly-Sabbath-work, no necessity nor mercy enforcing or warranting them thereunto. As for the breaking of Bread, whether that expressed in the seventh, or the other in the eleventh verse, if it were admitted to be used in the Admini∣stration and participation of the LORD's Supper, yet this objector himself doth affirm, that it was often done by Apostles and Disciples on other daies of the week than on that which he so earnestly contends for: And whereas he doth assert that no day else but only the First day of the Week was peculiarly appointed for break∣ing of Bread in that ordinance: Whither shall we go for a warrant and proof of this? We find no such appointment by our LORD in the Scriptures; and the Objector cannot but acknowledg, that our LORD Jesus Christ did institute and administer it at the first appointing and dispensing of that New-Testament or∣dinance of the supper, on another day of the Week, than the first day: For, the Objector affirms elsewhere, that the passover day in that year was the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath: and <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 23.-26.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> doth expresly say that it was the same Night in which he was betrayed; then it was, that, he took the Bread and the Cup in this LORDly Supper: And this did <HI>Paul</HI> receive from the LORD, and so did deliver it unto that Corinthian-Church of Saints, as that word-Rule by which they were to reform their abuses which had crept in amongst them, as to that or∣dinance particularly, and according unto which they were exactly to measure all their Administrations. If this Objector do urge humane Authorities without Scripture-evidence, we shall shew the vanity and weakness, the incogency and unconvincingness of that empty Plea after a while. Reader exercise thy discerning here? Is there any thing in this place that speaks at all of any change of the week∣ly-Sabbath from the Seventh to the first day of the Week? do either the signifi∣cancy of the words or the intendment of the place, or the force of the context, or any necessary unavoidable consequence, present any such thing to an impartial un∣prejudiced understanding, which doth report a matter of fact done upon ano∣ther day, not medling with any state of this question about this matter of Right. Has the First day of the Week either the name of the Weekly Sabbath or the sub∣stance and essence of it? Is there any one word of Command found here requiring beleiving Christians to observe the First Day as the Weekly Sabbath? Is there a∣ny Promise made over to the weekly observers of it As such?

the Seventh daies being now any longer the Weekly-Sabbath-day? Can this Objector satisfie and establish thee upon any firm ground, such as is Scriptural, by any contrary arguing, wherein nothing of all this can befound? The plain Historical Narration doth inform us that <HI>Paul</HI> abode at <HI>Troas,</HI> seven daies, in the sixth verse: And whether he came to <HI>Troas</HI> on the First day of the week, search may be made: <HI>Troas</HI> standing near the Sea of <HI>Hellespont</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> the less, whether <HI>Paul</HI> came from <HI>Philippi,</HI> that was scituated in <HI>Greece,</HI> which was on the other side of <HI>Hellespont,</HI> or of the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea; which Sea did lie between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> the less: <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Acts 18. 5. &amp; 19. 21, 22.</NOTE> <HI>Macedonia,</HI> whence <HI>Paul</HI> came, was a Province in <HI>Graecia;</HI> There at <HI>Troas Paul</HI> stayed seven daies inclusively, in the fifth and six verses of this twentyeth Chapter, spending a Seventh-day-Sabbath amongst them, and then went away from them the next Week, in the Seventh and eleventh verses, after the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. The Objector therefore mistaking the day to be the first day of the week, whereas, It was the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath, all that which he doth wrongly build upon that mistake, falleth to the Ground, together with that mistake, This answer, drawn up from the true proper translating of the words, one of the Sabbaths, I mainly stick to, as plain, convincing, and self Evidencing, though I have elsewhere drawn up much more about it: We are not hurried away with noise and multitude: But that which swayes with us, and keeps our hearts in an awesul fear, and tremb∣ling-joy, and believing establishment, with sweet satisfaction, nourishing delight, and great complacency, is the Word of the adored Almighties, clearly opened, well-agreeingly-collated, soundly understood, and rightly applyed: Christ and his word have their Authority with us, beyond any man or men whatsoever, or any or all of their sayings to the contrary. His words do always best express things, according to the true Nature of them in their own familiar sense, which the Holy Spirit doth give of them in their respective places. The same Genuin significan∣cy has this Phrase in that passage to the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 16. 2</NOTE> Corinthians, where also it is, in true propriety of speech, not the first day of the Week, but one of the Sabbaths, meaning according to the proper significancy of the words, phrase, and thing, either one of the Sabbaths between Passover and Pentecost inclusively, as in the former place; <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">i. Cor, 5. 7, 8 &amp; 16. 2, 8.</NOTE> of which two Feasts he makes express mention in the same E∣pistle, and of one of them, in the same Chapter; or else one of the Sabbaths, of one or other of those Three great Festivals spoken of <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Deuter 16. 16, 17.</NOTE> else where: The Feast of Unleaveneds, The Feast of Sevennies. and the Feast of Booths, or leaf-hutts, es∣pecially at the time of ingathering the yearly Fruits and increase of the Earth, at which time they were able by such a revolution of a year to pass a Judgment upon <HI>Jehovahs</HI> Blessing of them, (which cannot be so well estimated on every Weekly return,) for, then, all the Males that appeared before the Faces of <HI>Jehovah</HI> were not to appear empty, but every man according to the gift of his Hand, or accor∣ding to the Blessing of <HI>Jehovah</HI> his God (which is much the same with the ex∣pression in this Epistle,) which he had given him, And this reply has consent and agreement with other Scriptures, and with the nature of the Duty of Chari∣table Relieving and is evident upon the same place. It is the confession and ac∣knowledgment of an adversary, as was Noted a few leafs before, that, about the time of the writing of the Books of the New-Testament, both the Jews them∣selves, and all the Heathen that took notice of them, called all their Feasts and solemn assemblies, their Sabbaths: Because, they did no servile work in them, they had the general Nature of the weekly Sabbath in a cessation from Labour. It is known and confessed, saith he, that at that time (when <HI>Paul</HI> wrote to the Church at <HI>Colosse,</HI> which they suppose to be about twenty and nine years after Christs Ascension into Heaven:) all Iudaical observation of daies, or the daies which they religiously observed, whether Feasts or Fasts, Weekly, Monthly, or Annual, were by themselves and all other called their Sabbaths. They were so called by God himself from their Analogy. Thus he. And this First Epistle to the Corinthians is reckoned by some to be sent unto that Church about two and twenty years after Christs ascension. So that to translate the words, one of the Sabbaths is the most proper significant Rendring, the most pertinent to the drift and Scope, and the most Harmonious in consent with the whole Scripture

that treats of this matter: The believing Corinthians were to lay a way by them∣selves somewhat of their income, proportionable to the LORD's prospering of them in a way or Journey of their particular Trades, Functions, and callings: Thus, gathering some Treasure, that, they might have in a readiness, that which might afford a <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.

Here is therefore no firm bottom in this place objected to ground a transferring of the weekly Sabbath from one day to another, which is nothing at all the design of this place (as neither is it of any other place through the Word of Truth.) The Words in their true proper significancy are according to one of the Sabbaths: The Article being omitted here, it doth signifie distributely, according to one or other, or each of those Sabbaths: So that, the day here specified doth relate to some one or other of those Sabbath-Festivals fore-mentioned. There were <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Lev 23. 10. 20, 39. Luk. 6. 1.

So that here, Those of an inquiring Spirit are led safely out of the Maze of those perplexing difficulties, which the Objectors reasoning about the necessariness of human Histories to make up a full evidence of the Scriptures in the matter of the first day, would hurry them into, and such diligent re-searchers are brought into a plain way, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Jer. 6. 16.

It must here be his meaning, the Seventh, which is the last day of the week, which he takes to be the First day of that Feast of unleavened bread; On which the Paschal Lamb, according to Institution, was to be eaten, which was not the First day of the Week, but the Seventh. Upon this Supposition, I would thus questioningly argue; either Christ that year kept the very day of Passover, according to Institution, or not; if Christ kept the true Passover-day (as I do not at all doubt but that he did; for <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Mat. 3. 15.

For, ac∣cording to this that First day was the next immediate day after his death, and could in no Sense be called the Third day on which he rose again: If he say, That the true Passover-day, which not Christ, but the Jews kept, was the day next af∣ter the death of Christ, we call for an Answer to the forecited Scriptures in the Margin, and expect a Word-proof for what he asserts: Although, if that could be cleared, yet has it no Rightness or Forcibleness of arguing in it to demonstrate what it is brought for, as to a First-day-Sabbath: But if those Scriptures do, in so many express Words, give the day of Christs being apprehended and condemned and crucified and killed the First day of unleavened bread, and the Passover-day, whilst we have the Scripture thus speaking, we have no cause to be moved at what Humane Authorities and Church-Histories do record to the contrary. And this has now brought me to an Examination of the validity or invalidity of Church-histo∣ries and of humane Authorities in these matters.</P>
<P>Though several of the Ecclesiastical Historians have been examined by me upon this subject matter; and I have some Collections by me about it, enough to shew how little credit is to be given unto those kind of Authorities, which are so fallible, and sometimes so self-contradicting, and so altogether unsatisfying, when the matter of Right comes to be Inquired after, and determined, any further than they do speak the mind of Christ in his word (For, either in these Cases of Consci∣ence they write and speak according to the word, or not? If they do, let these Scriptures be particularly pointed to, with which they accord. If not, they are not to be received or followed.) Yet, in regard, that, my design is to bring all to the Scriptures of truth, referring this and all else under <HI>Aelohim</HI> to their Judgment, I shall therefore now debate the Principle with this objector. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">John 20. two last ver.</NOTE> So much of matters of fact, as do relate to matters of right, and as are necessary for us to believe in order unto Salvation, is Recorded in the word of truth: Whereunto the whole Scripture is profitable; which is enough for us, if no more were written by me, concerning this particular question in hand: For, that Scripture referred to, is proper and pertinent to this purpose, about Christ and his Resurrection, and his appearing to his Disciples, and his Blessing of them, and conference with them, as is plain, in the foregoing part of the same Chap∣ter; and other Scriptures collated and compared with this, do evidently speak it. But, we have yet much more to say about this. To assert the perfection of

the Scriptures, is one of the great truths of the present Age: The forces of Earth and of Hell are now joyning together and putting forth their strength to assault and to attempt the overthrow of this useful Doctrine: As it was in the daies of Christs Flesh, when he was familiarly Conversant here on Earth, the <HI>Roman</HI> Power the <HI>Grecian</HI> Wisdom the <HI>Jewish</HI> Traditions, <HI>Ethnick</HI> Philosophers, and <HI>Diaboli∣cal</HI> possessions, all the humane and devilish Force and Art and invention was cal∣led together to War against Christ and against his word. So in the latter daies; the Worldly might, Old and New Philosophy, Institutions and Impositions, Histories and Traditions, Inventions and Authorities of men, unwritten (pre∣tended necessary) verities, Generall Councils, sayings of those whom they call <HI>Fathers,</HI> Articles of Faith composed by men, Confessions and practise of Prote∣stant Reformed Churches, the judgment and practice of Learned and Godly men, these and such like Extra-scriptural places, are the swaying Authority with many whereby Antichristianism and Antiscripturalism in a many of particulars are still held up and maintained against the LORD and against his word, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Isai. 40. 5, 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> who in this Providential day is pouring contempt upon all Flesh, upon men and upon their sayings, bringing a Blast upon them (so far as they are contrary to sound Doctrine, and do oppose the mind of Christs Revealed in the written word:) and is putting a Crown on Christ, and an Honour upon his word. the Testimony of men may be, and often is, in Fact, Erring and Fallible, uncertain and lying, self-con∣tradicting and unsatisfying. Into which therefore the Christian Doctrine Faith and Religion is not to be resolved; either in whole or in part: For, the word of <HI>Jehovah</HI> is like himself, who is the Author of it, of invaluable veracity; and of unchangeable truthfulness. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">John. 14. 6. &amp; 17. 17.

And how few are there of those, to whom the Gospel is preached, and upon whose Hearts that word of Grace and of Truth doth take most saving holds (to which word the LORD himself doth bear witness) are versed and read in this kind of Ecclesiastical History? And which way shall they be ascertained, that, it has been all of it read over by others, by their Guides and teachers particularly, or that the report is faithfully brought to them, or if that were, whether they ought to be swayed by it? Were Church-Histories unerringly inspired? Who is so bold, as downright to assert this? Or if any were so daring, how can he prove it? Who of our plain Converted People had humane Histories in his thoughts when he was thorowly Regenerated and gratiously visited from Christ, and from the Father of Christ by the Spirit of Christ in the word of Christ?

ready to have irritated the powers that were over them against them, as their Adversaries did: Neither do men therefore err, because they know not the Tra∣dition of the Elders, which has long obtained by common Custom, and by little Controlled usage, so as to plead prescription. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">1.

He, who is of a dili∣gent observing inquiring Spirit, and is versed in this kind of the Historical part of human learning in Ecclesiastical Centuriators, may meet with enough to take him off from doting on such fallible Authorities, which are not a sure ground of judging in matters either of Doctrine or of Fact.</P>
<P>In the matter of Doctrine, how common is it for one to affirm what another of them doth contradict, as about the Millennium, or the Thousand years Reign, with many more instances that might be given, as about Free Grace and about Free will, about <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> about the vision of God whether the Souls of departed Saints be Blessed with it till the Judgment of the great day, or not? with such like. Which of those now shall carry away the state of the question? In some Cases, the Major party often went the wrong way as in the Rites and Ceremonies of Baptism and of Prayer, and in many Feasts and Fasts, and divers such humane inventions, by which they added their own corrupt mixtures to Christs Pure institutions. As for the Churches in the first centuries after the Apostles, how shall we be ascertained, that, they were the most pure and perfect Churches, seeing some of those that were of Apostolical plantation did so apostatize, make such a sudden defection from the Gospel-purity, and were so much corrupted in the Apostles own times, as those particularly <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1.

Were there no learned and Godly men, such as were counted Fathers in the Churches, from whom we receive no Writings at all? May not some of their Writings have been lost? Are there not false copies of the writings of some of them? Are they not supposititious and counterfeit and corrupt? Do they not vary widely in their Interpretations of one and the same Scripture? How can these uncertainties be a firm Ground and sure evidence of the Authenticall meaning of the word of God?</P>
<P>How unconcluding and unsatisfying also is their Testimony; in the matters of fact, when one of equal Antientness, and Authority doth gainsay another, or when some greater Authorities as some of them were esteemed, would step in &amp; over rule, and when they charge one another with misreports and mistakes, how Sandy a foun∣dation is there here for any Spiritual discerner to build upon; take one or two in∣stances, some in the History of Christs life do expresly Record, that, he was near Fifty years old when he was put to death, whereas others of them in their Chronologies do with equal confidence write, that he was then but about thirty and three years of age.

Too much advantage has been given by the Non-Conformists in their writings and conferences against the Formalists and ceremonialists, in that, they have not in downright express Terms, condemned all humanely-invented-instituted-imposed forms and ceremonies in the matters of Worship, as sinful and unlawful, especially when they enjoyn them as exclusive of other worship where these are not conformed unto, and when they impose them as necessary terms of Church Communion: whereas they are expresly in the very letter and meaning of the second Commandment forbidden: For, we are not to make unto our selves all Form, any Form, every such Form, which men of their own head, and out of the device of their own brain do thus make unto themselves and so to others also, is under a plain prohibition by this Holy righte∣ous, just and good law of the LORD.

Whereas we are expresly charged not to give our selves to such commandments of men, as turn away the truth from us, or would turn us away from the Truth: And yet they urge a mis-translated Scripture, as if we must submit to every Ordinance of man: Whereas it is, to every humane Creature.

invented Arts and Sciences, besides that which <HI>Aelohim</HI> had put into Created Nature, and Revealed word: The sum and the argument, the Subject and the matter, the drift and the Design, the Scope and the End; of this Book, is to set out the vanity and unsuccesfulness of Philosophick Learning and opinions about the cheifest good of man, discovering and confuting their mistakes. by an induct∣ion of particulars in the way of their own Logical Method: Detecting the fallaci∣ousness of their arguing, and the carnality of their principles, and the corruptness of their Tenets, shewing, that mans happiness is found in the saving knowledge, sound Faith, holy Fear, and perfecting Obedience, of, and to, <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> and his will revealed in his word, and not in the mishapen-monstrous-fancyed fe∣licities of Ethnick Philosophers: nor in a skilfulness in their Arts and Sciences, whether more speculative, metaphysical ones, to gratify the unmortified volup∣tuousness of a wanton intellect: or more practical ones, suited to an animal ap∣petite, a sensitive itch, and a sensual life, immersed in fleshly disquisitions, and in carnal delight. <HI>Solomon</HI> had been long Conversant in Paganish knowledges, and doth now manifest the vainness of its vanity, introducing the several Sects, pleading and disputing for their way and party: And then answering their Argu∣ments, and bewraying the Captious deceitfulness of them. So that it would much improve usefull learning, to point out exactly and particularly through this Book, when it is that an Ethnick Philosopher doth Logically Syllogize, and Rhetorically perswade: (For what is the Logicians Major, is the Rhetoricians Proposition, what is the Philosophers Minor is the Orators Assumption, and what is the Sophisters Conclusion is the Perswaders Complexion or Inference:) and when it is that, a Theological Christian Preacher doth Spiritually confute and convin∣cingly disswade, self evidencingly prove, and demonstratively argue. I there∣fore propound this Disquisition to the Studious and ingenious, as a further aug∣ment of profitable Learning. When men do ask Counsel of unscriptural Phi∣losophy, it is a Spirit of Whoredome that causeth them to err. Sensuality bring∣eth forth errour: Inordinate love after creature-knowledges and enjoyments, se∣duceth them from the faith, Wizardly-Philosophy was <HI>Balaams</HI> Errour, and too many are still wandering in that by-way of his: That is the best Religion with the most that is accommodated to their peace and plenty, which will cloath their backs and fill their bellies, which will take them off from self-denyal and from cross-bearing; and although divers are not so drencht in sottishness and sensuali∣ties, but are sober Scholars and chast Students, yet the unscriptural way they take in their researches into natural Histories and experimental Philosophy, will never so attain its useful end for the true advance of profitable Learning, till more stu∣died in the Book of Scriptures, and suiting all experiments unto this word-know∣ledge. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Luke 9. 4, 5. 55, 1.

Here the Platonists did err by concei∣ving of strange Ideas of things, and then nursing up their monstrous bratts. It is one choice part of experimental Christianity, and which needs much of spiritual discerning, to know what manner of Spirit we are of. Even a <HI>James</HI> and a <HI>John,</HI> two of Christs eminent Disciples, were rebuked by Christ for that, they did not discriminate wisely in this matter.

We must not be∣leive every Spirit, but ought to try the Spirits whether they are of God: The Spirit of others, and our own Spirit, that, we may know the Spirit of truth ac∣cording to Christ and his word, and may difference it from the Spirit of Errour, which is against Christ and his word.

because they know not the doubtful Questionings of unsettled Sceptick's and of Cosmical Suspecters. The Doctrine of Probabilities: (So the word signifies in that place to the <HI>Colossians</HI> cited in the margin:) is a misleading Doctrine: It would beguil men by doubtful disputations and by deceitful conclusions with such cunning perswasions as do carry a fair shew; such as Logicians and Rhetoricians, Philosophers and Orators, do usually bring, under the shadowie colour of pro∣bable Reasons and likely Arguments, to make nothing of all things and any thing of every thing, by their sophistical <HI>Quidlibets,</HI> and Fallacious <HI>Quodlibets:</HI> But Sound, serious, well discerning, right Judging beleivers should not suffer themselves thus to be imposed upon and deluded. A thorow, wholesome Scripture-knowledge is one approved remedy against Heart-doubtings, either to prevent them or to cure them: This would bring in sound Truth upon and leave them with a renewed Heart; with a no-doubt there of them. God cannot lye at any time, though men do so too often. He is true: Whilst men are so overcome of doubtings and waver∣ings, (not in the way, which is sometimes the case of sound Beleivers, but a∣bout the way) how can they go on with such conviction and comfort, with such sweetness and satisfaction? Let not the Reader misjudge this a Diversion and that too long a one also: For, besides that, it contains a direct answer to the Ob∣jection, which did call for it, so doth it fully promote the grand designe of this Treatise. All unscriptural, Antiscriptural waies, methods, arguings, and en∣deavourings to turn any from the Errour of their way to the Truth, is no adap∣ted means for the attaining of this end. And therefore in the Demonstrating proofs that I have brought for the confirming and establishing of the Seventh day, the last day of the Week, to be still the weekly Sabbath, they are such as are car∣ried through the whole Scripture and have their Foundation in pure primitive cre∣ated Nature: I do not send and refer them to humane Authorities, and Histories, and Traditions, as this Objector doth. The Scripture-way is the only convin∣cing converting way: Other <HI>Mediums</HI> by self-excogitated and man-invented Ar∣tifices are like to leave Erring men but the more profound <HI>Atheists,</HI> the more lear∣ned <HI>Infidels,</HI> and the more subtil <HI>Hereticks.</HI> Though arguments, as to men, may be drawn from their own Concessions, assertions, histories, and other Authori∣ties of mens sayings, writings, and printings, which was somewhat of the way that <HI>Paul</HI> sometimes took with Ethnicks and Philosophers, whereby to stop their Mouths, and to convince them from thence; As Christ also will one day by the same Medium condemn many from their own acknowledged principles not im∣proved, yet this will not convincingly convert a plain sound believer having Spiritual discerning in the truths and things of the Spirit of God, and being well acquainted with the Scriptures, is far better secured against dangerous dam∣nable Errours than the most learned of vain affecters of humane wisdom. The only summary of all sound truth, for the confuting and condemning of all Errour, is to be searched after in the Scriptures of truth, where the Restauration, Profi∣ciency and advancement, of all useful learning is. When can a serious inquiring Spirit come to any firm settlement and sound satisfaction, if he were to refer all to the extrascriptural Judgment and Histories, of Churches? Heresies and Schisms, profanenesses and disorders, quickly crept in, into particular Churches that were of Apostolical plantation: As <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles to them do evidently declare. And since that, one particular Church doth sometimes contradict another particular Church in their confessions of Faith; and the contention is so hot and so high, as that, they withdraw from one another, and will not have mutual Communion with each other. As for the universal Church how shall a particular beleiver be well groundedly ascertained, what is the concurrent Judgement of the Universal Church? How fruitless and vain have their attempts hitherto been who have en∣deavoured by conference, and Writing, and Cost, and Labour and Pains, and Travel, to be Church-Reconciliators, Church-peace-makers? They dyed away, and never lived to see their designe accomplished. Still there are differences and divisions kept up amongst the Churches, one great cause whereof has been, that, the Attempters and promoters of Church-union and peace have been setting up some confession of Faith, and Articles of Religion, of humane Composure, which they would have all to joyn in and subscribe to: Which course will never be
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
able to accomplish that designe. The whole Scripture of Truth is the one and the only rule of this. Suppose yet further, that, I knew, that, the Concurrent Judgment of all the Churches of Christ all the inhabited Earth over were of one mind and of one way in some things, yet neither could this alone, or mainly; secure me from fears of Erring. For, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Levit. 4. 13. 2. Chron. 30. 5. &amp;. 35. 18.

Under the Old Testament the LORD himself appointed a special Sacrifice for Atonement and reconciliation in this particular Case, when the whole Congregation or Church of <HI>Israel</HI> did err through ignorance in omitting some commanded duty, or in Committing some forbidden Sin: And that, they act∣ually did thus ignorantly err, for some hundreds of years together, we have it recorded in the word. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">John. 6. 15, Luke 24. 21.

How can any man to his own, or others satis∣faction, affirm that by Humane History, he certainly knows that, all the Christian Churches have constantly set apart, and observed the first day for holy Wor∣ship, when he cannot certainly know, that he hath read all humane Histories that have recorded that particular matter of fact? Or that no humane History hath recorded a quite different, both Principle, Judgement and Practice in some particular Church or Churches, and when the matter of fact, for any evidence he hath to the contrary, may have been quite otherwise, in some Church or Churches, which yet is not recorded in any humane History? This Objector doth not confirm his reasoning thus, only with respect to the first Day, but doth carry it much further on, by his asserting, that the first Institution of Church Officers, and Orders, as well as that of the LORD's Day, (by which he means the first Day) was not by Scripture: The proof, saith he, is undeniable, because the Old Testament did not contain the Institution, <HI>e. g.</HI> of particular Churches, Sacraments, Presbyters, Deacons, Diaconesses, and the LORD's Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the New Testament was none of it written till <HI>An.</HI> 40. at soonest; and it was not all written till <HI>An.</HI> 99. Now it is certain, that the Church was not all these years without the Orders now in question, nor without a day to meet on for publick Worship; even as Baptism and the LORD's Supper were Instituted by Christ himself, long before the writing of any part of the New Testament, and the Church was in long possession of them, upon the bare word and Declaration of the Apostles. So he writes.</P>
<P>That the Church was not all these years without a day to meet on for pub∣lick Worship, we readily subscribe, for they knew the Seventh day Sabbath was the weekly day to meet on for that end; of which the Churches had had long possession, for near four thousand years; and of which they had still the Te∣nure; and for the continuance of which title and practice they had the whole Writen Word of God: whereunto the practice of Christ, and of his Apostles did fully agree: But as for his other exemplified instances, we desire both him and the Reader, a little to consider: If these were received and practised by the Church, upon the bare verbal Declaration of the Apostles, and not by Scripture, what then meant the Types of these? Did these signifie nothing? Was there nothing of these understood by <HI>Moses, Aaron,</HI> the Priests and Levites? Did not <HI>Moses</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Exod. 14. 15-22.

Though there was a veil upon these and such other Figures and Shadows, in the reading of the Old Testament, yet Believers had some knowledge of their meaning, and some insight into their Mystery: and there were Teachers by Office, who were to interpret the signifyingness of these things, and to open the spiritual part of the Pattern. Had not these things a Spiritual Relation unto Christ, and to an after administration of Grace? Was not this the end, the drift, the design, the purport, the scope, of these Instituti∣ons to refer unto Christ?

Several Prophesies also under that former Ministration, do speak punctu∣ally to this matter; though we who have the New Testament-fulfilling of them, and Commentary upon them, have a more clear unveiled manifestation of them. The Christian Religion for sum, and for substance, being one and the same under both dispensations, particularly as to the institutions mentioned: For there is <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 10 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11.

As for Church-Officers, Overseers, Presbyters or Elders, teaching and ruling Ones, Pastors and Teachers, Diacons or Ministers, under the Old Testament it were no very difficult task to write a large Treatise upon that particular subject, especially by one that is ac∣quainted with the Original Hebrew, and the several words and phrases under that dispensation, that do speak to this case.

The stile of the New doth not carry along with it a form of enacting such new Laws, and new Rules, of which there was not any thing at all under the Old Administration: But we find Christ <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE> con∣firming the old Laws of the ten Words, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">John 19. 28.

(The difference between them being only in the divers form, and manner of dispensing, as will be more shewn hereafter.) The regulation now is to be made according to that propor∣tion which the new Administration doth call for, and the old Rules must be new applyed; which as to the matter now here under Question have a clearer Revelation, and a more spiritual Dispensing. So that the New Testament Word is much the Old Testament Scripture gone over again, in more clearness, fulness, perfection, spirituality, glory and heavenliness. The Old and the New Te∣stament-Will of God, are not contrary Wills, but one and the same Will, diver∣sified only in some particulars of the manner of administring: the new Will is the old Will revived, and cleared, and confirmed, and so put into a more hea∣venly form. There is a well measured equality between the Old and the New, a well agreeing sameness of word, and there should be a true proportioned collation of both Testaments each with other. All and every of Christ's In∣stitutions had ever a word of his to warrant them: even in the times of the Apo∣stles, a word written about such Institutions in the Old Testament in Type, Pro∣phesie, or some such like way: and a Word spoken by Christ before the New Testament was written, referring to the foregoing Patterns of them in the Old, which word afterwards also was put into the New Testament Scripture: where∣as we know no word from Christ, either in the Old Testament or New, for the first day being a weekly day, separated and appointed for a day of Holy Wor∣ship in the room of the Seventh day Sabbath. Thus far this Author himself
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
doth acknowledge, that the first day was not instituted by Scripture, all the Old Testament through; which did not contain its Institution; so that the Belie∣vers of that age in Christ's time, had no written word at for any such obser∣vance of the first day, any where all their Bible through. Let this concession be improved by the wise and discerning, the serious and the considering Reader. However therefore the matter of fact may have been afterwards reported in Humane Histories, we expect, that the matter of Right be proved from God-inspired Scriptures. Whatever this Author do say, that this being the common usage of so observing the first day in the Apostles times, by them and by the Churches of their Plantation, and that therefore there was no such need of putting this pretended matter of fact into Scripture History; it appears hereby, how bro∣ken this Reed of his Assertion is, which he would have all the Christian World to lean upon. After several years serious, diligent search, I cannot find any such common usage, no not so much as one particular instance, that either any one of the Apostles themselves, or any one of the Churches of their planting did ever so much as once so observe the first day, as the weekly Sabbath-day: Although if that could be proved, it doth not yet determine this case upon our hearts, who do expect Scripture Institutions, Commands, Prophecies, Promises, and such like appointments, as have harmonious consent of the whole Scripture be∣sides, that speaks of that matter, if there had been any such great change of the weekly Sabbath-day, as is pretended. If the force of this Authors arguing do lye there, how evident is it, that there was great need of writing such a Matter of Fact, that had so weighty a case of so great consequence in it! <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Jer. 33 6-15. Gen. 23. <HI>later end.</HI></NOTE> It is the common practice of all the wise part of mankind, to take along with them sufficient credible witnesses of it, such whose Testimony will upon occasion stand firm in Law, when they first take actual possession of some great Estate, of a rich Inheritance settled upon them, and upon theirs that shall come after them; and to set it down in writing, and to keep the Records of it well attest∣ed, especially when another doth claim a former Title for some hundreds of years: (As this of the seventh-day Sabbath did, for some thousands of years;) for some ages beyond the memory of man; and when they could not but foresee, that their Title would be so much called in question, and controverted: and especially too, where the Matter of Fact is pretended, as it is by this Author, so much to prove the Matter of Right: All Matters of Fact that do pass into Historical Writing, are fittest to be written in the same age wherein they were done, as being then better known in their circumstances by sensible demonstra∣tions, which cannot be so well discerned in after ages. How fond are Traditi∣onists of unscriptural, humane Antiquities and Universalities? Whereas Errors have been ancient, even as long, full home to the times of the Apostles: <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 Thess. 2. 3, 7. 1 John 2. 18. &amp; 4. 3. 1 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3. Rev. 13. 3, 4.</NOTE> E∣ven then did the Mystery of iniquity begin to work; there were even then many Antichrists and Malignant Assemblies: and when the Antichrist shall be reveal∣ed, there would be a great Apostasie and Defection from the Truth. The Re∣velation hath foretold, that all the World would go a whoring after the Beast, and would worship the Beast and the Dragon that gave him power; yet are these some of their Notes of a visible Church, Antiquity and Universality: which that they might be the sooner imposed upon, the hoodwinck'd credu∣lous World, have another vain pretence going along with them, altogether as unscriptural and vain, as they; that is, that the Church cannot err. And they falsly call their particular Romish Synagogue, the Catholick Church. I expect∣ingly believe, and hopingly wait for a coming day, when our plain, tender, sin∣cere, upright-hearted people will be undeceived, and no longer to suffer them∣selves to be deluded and imposed upon by such confident Assertions as this Ob∣jector doth bring them: As if that, which beyond all doubt must assure them, that <HI>de facto,</HI> the first day was by the Apostles separated for holy Worship, espe∣cially in publick Church Assemblies, is the full and unquestionable expository e∣vidence of the practice of all the Churches in the World, since the very days of the Apostles. For so has this Learned Author affirmed. Reader, bethink thy self, what thy Faith must resolve it self into, if it will follow this misguiding? How can such believers as never traded in this kind of humane Learning ever
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
come to undoubted assurance about the matter? How can they be fully ascer∣tained of this who were never versed, nor are ever like to be, neither are under any such obligation by any Scripture Precept to be throughly versed, and under∣standingly read, in all and every of the Writings, of all and every of the Ec∣clesiastical Histories, that do write about this? Or, if it were possible and facible, that they could compass this (of which I can see no end; who yet have more helps and advantages this way than the most) How can they unquessionably be confirmed in this perswasion, that there never was any one Church of Christ that did escape the Humane Church-Record and History? And if so, who can tell them, but that, that particular Church might be of a different judgement and practice? What doth this kind of arguing in this Author mean? What? would it have our people, to resolve their satisfaction and assurance (concerning the pretended first day Sabbath) into that report which their humane fallible Guides do make unto them of this, without their tryal of it? <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">1 John 4 1-6. 1 Thess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 20, 21. Isai 8. 20.</NOTE> The Word of Christ doth call upon them to try the spirits, whether they be of God, and to prove all things that are thus brought them by Teachers, by the Scripture-canon and Touch stone, as the one and the only infallible Rule. What a kind of Faith is that, which is a trusting of fallible men without tryal? a depending upon Humane Authorities without Scripture Evidence? The God-inspired Authority of Christ, and of his Word, is fully attested within the holy Scriptures own bounds, and needs not step out to Humane Histories, Authorities and Traditions: How∣ever this Author would buz into the ear such amazing expressions as this, that it is impossible it should be otherwise than as such Humane Historie doth re∣cord of the practice of all the Churches since the times of the Apostles, and that this Testimony is infallible.</P>
<P>Humane History, and that part of it which they call Ecclesiastical History, however it be a pleasant study, and an employ someways in its place profitable, yet of all kinds of Scientifick Learning, is one of the weakest common places of arguing, and the least convincing for demonstration, because it doth resolve its probations into the fallible Testimonies of lying men, and so doth not, cannot give any firm full satisfaction to an inquiring Spirit, and studious Mind, who will still be doubtful and afraid, how he doth bottom his Faith, in so weighty a case as is now before him, upon such an unsure and unsafe ground, as he can build no firmness of belief and certainty of knowledge upon, even the uncertain witness of deceivable men, what their eyes, and ears, and tongues, and pens have reported to us, who are so many hundred years come into the World after they were dead and gone; that way of disputing therefore, which this mighty man of Humane Reason has walked in to find out some place if he could, where to make his First day Sabbath cause to stand, is such a by-path as doth mislead his Reader into bogs, where he cannot settle and stay with any good confidence, and sound comfort, Such arguments may take with over credulous minds, and with passive intellects, who, through idleness and guile of spirit in a matter which would ingage them in so much of self-denyal, and of cross bearing, had rather use another man's writings and reasonings, than be at the pains of study∣ing of the Scriptures, and of exercising their own understanding.</P>
<P>What has at large been written in trying this Objectors spirit upon the for∣mer Scriptures in an answer also to the next mentioned by him in the Re∣velation; which he calleth another Historical hint of the New Testa∣ment.</P>
<P>How can a change of the weekly Sabbath-day from one day to another, from the seventh to the first, be soundly proved from <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Rev. 1. 10.</NOTE> this other Scripture? where he, that is of a serious spirit, and doth diligently inquire after word-satisfaction about this matter, cannot find either <HI>Sabbath</HI> or <HI>First day;</HI> either in terms plainly expressed, or clearly implyed, or necessarily inferred; in this place, or in the context, or in the design of the Holy Spirit here, or by comparing of it with other places of Scripture? Those that would lay the foundation of so great a change, should see their Scripture grounds to be more evident, convincing, and firm. What one Word is there in this Scripture, that doth warrant any new Instition from Christ, for the observing of the First day, as the weekly Sabbath-day?
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
What one word is there here of command so to observe the First day? What one word of Promise made to the observers of the First day as such? What one word of threatning against any that do not so observe the First day, as the weekly Sabbath day? and if there be not any one word here, for the First day, either as to Institution or Command, or Promise, or Threating, how can any observer keep it aright, either in Faith or Obedience, in Hope or Fear? The direct plain meaning of this Scripture is, if I mis-judge not, that this day doth evidently relate to that providential Day of the LORD Christ's appearing in the fulfilling of this Prophesie, who appeared to <HI>John</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Rev. 17. 14. &amp; 19. 16.</NOTE> as LORD pleading the Cause of his Kingly Lordly Office, which has been too long, and too far invaded by the Kings and Lords of the Earth, who have not inforced Christ's Laws, nor made them to be the Rule of Government, but usurped an unscri∣ptural authority over mens consciences and souls. How Lordly a Day therefore will it be when Christ will recover and exercise his Power and his Right!

This is not the design, at least, not as to the pretended change of the Weekly Sabbath-day. It was <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 7. com∣pared with <HI>Zach.</HI> 12. 10.</NOTE> that Lordly Day of Christ's coming, when he would convert and recover the cho∣sen remnant of those of <HI>Israel,</HI> and of <HI>Judah,</HI> and destroy the Rebellious, and the unbelieving among them. If men will be limiting of this day to any one determinate, definite particular day of the week, what one day has such a plea as the Seventh-day Sabbath?

Book.</NOTE> Ecclesiastical Historians do relate, that <HI>John,</HI> and his followers the Eastern Asiatick Churches, did keep the Pass∣over on the Seventh-day, not pressing the observation of the first day, for the celebration of the Passover, as the Western Churches did: Further, as in Low-Dutch, the seventh Day is named <HI>Rust-dagh,</HI> that is the Day of Sabbath, or of Rest; so in Teutonick or High Dutch, or the German Tongue (which is an an∣cient Nation and Language) the last Day, the seventh Day of the Week, is called <HI>Samstag,</HI> as if <HI>Schemtag,</HI> that is the LORD's Day, or the Day of the LORD. It is further yet observable, as to this, that the Visions of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and those of <HI>John,</HI> well agreeing in many particulars, (which a diligent comparer may easily observe) <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 1. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s Visions, were on the fifth day of the fourth Moon, which some affirm to have been the Seventh day Sabbath, <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Day. But upon the whole, it is the first answer that I more stick unto, namely that, the Lordly Day is that great Providential Day, when he will more visibly appear as King and LORD. Whereas, some do object, that this word in <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, 1 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. 20. 23, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4, 25, 26, 27. 29. 32.</NOTE> Greek, Lordly, is applyed but to one thing more in the New Testament, which is the Supper, called the Lordly Supper, or LORD's Supper, or the Supper of the LORD: What can there rationally, necessarily, convincingly be inferred from thence, as to any establishing of the first day of the week in the room of the seventh, as the weekly Sabbath, in this place of the Revelation? The Lordly Supper, or Lordy Supper, is expresly mentioned. Whereas, here is no express mention of the first Day, as a Sabbath day, not either of the words, First or Sabbath, nor their sense and meaning in the Text or Context, nor any where else in all this Book, or in the whole Scripture. The Lordly Supper is so called, in that it was instituted by our LORD: It is to his Honour, a Lordly Feast, one great design and end of it, being to exalt Christ in his Lordship; and to shew forth the Death of this LORD, till he came in his Lordly appearance in the later Day. This Ordinance was received of the LORD by <HI>Paul:</HI> It was the LORD who Instituted it: It sets out the LORD's Death: The Cup is called the Cup of the LORD: The LORD's Body, we read of also there.

For a further discovery, that a Day in some Scriptures is used for a larger space of time than from one going in of the Sun on one day, to the next going in of the Sun on the next day; consider, that in the Scriptures, day doth sometimes set out the time of Christ's Reign and glorious Power: <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">2 Thess. 2. 2. 2 Pet. 2. 9. 1.

The chief men of the Jews, who were counted the Builders, did more notoriously refuse Christ the Head Corner Stone, when being put to their choice, they actually, openly, declaredly preferred a <HI>Barabbas,</HI> who was a seditious Murderer, before an innocent, holy Jesus, and this on a Day of solemn Judicature; when the Judge <HI>Pilate</HI> sat upon Christ, either for life or for death: which also was by a joynt consent of chief Priests, and Rulers, and People, who cry out all at once, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Luk. 23. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1-21.

<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
that <HI>Psalm,</HI> that the Builders would refuse that Stone, which was to become for Head to the Corner: so accordingly did they act, as at many other times, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Acts 3. 13, 14, 15.</NOTE> so at these two seasons, one in Christ's life time, the other after his death; and both before his rising. The chief Priests did count themselves, and were counted by others to be Builders, yet thus notoriously did they refuse Christ. The word in the <HI>Psalm,</HI> according to the Hebrew, in its propriety of signification, is, they have reprobated, rejected, despised, refused, scorned, or turned away from: and that expression in a <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Acts 3. 13, 14.</NOTE> place of the New Testament, doth signifie, ye have earnestly desired and refused: and that when Judge <HI>Pilat</HI> had absolved him in his own declared judgement, yet did they crave earnestly, that a man mur∣derer, and a seditious one might be freed, and that Christ, whom yet they could not justly charge with any crime, or the least sin, might be crucified. Then and thus was Christ reprobated of these men. Was it not an eminent Day of mon∣strous rejecting, when the question being put to them, whether of the two they would have to be released, they preferred a seditious Murderer? <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 12. 1-14.

It was also Prophesied in that <HI>Psalm,</HI> that the people would pray, <HI>O Jeho∣vah save now, or prosper now, blessed be he that cometh in the Name of Jehovah:</HI> This was fullfilled before the Day of Christ's crucifixion, when he rode into <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and the people went forth to meet him, crying, <HI>Hosanna, Hoshignana,</HI> in the Hebrew, or <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">John 12. 12, 13.

These things are plain, fa∣miliar and clear, evident of themselves upon the bare reading of them, and are not any forced interpretations of my own. What a far way about do Objectors go, and carry their Followers along with them, to bring them at last to that which is no proof at all of that, for which they have brought them thither? As for the Day spoken of, which <HI>Jehovah</HI> made for his people to rejoyce in, it is the large Day of Grace under the New Testament Dispensation of Grace; which doth take in many a Natural Day: And <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 16. Psal. 90. 14. Isai. 65. 18. Psal 92. Title &amp; v. 1-4. Isai. 56. 7.</NOTE> as for spiritual rejoycing, it is every days work, though more especially upon the Seventh-day Sabbath: so that in short, there being not in the Scriptures urged by Objectors, either First day, or Sabbath-day, either in the letter of the words, or in any necessary conse∣quence, naturally flowing from thence, or any design that looks any thing like a change of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, translating it to any other day; How any satisfaction can such a change be inferred and inforced from hence? To re∣turn therefore a while, unto that place in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> although there must be some particular distinct determinate Day of the Week, when <HI>John</HI> first saw the beginning of this Vision; For all that doth come to pass in time, must necessa∣rily be on one Day or other of the Week; yet this Lordly Day here spoken of, had not this design at all in it, to set up the first day in the room of the seventh. The skilful in the Greek Tongue do know, that an Adjective joyned to a Substantive, doth usually mean the Genitive Case of that Substantive; as the Lordly Day, is the Day of Lordship, or Day of the LORD. So we find this expressed in <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Hutterus's</HI> Edition of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> New Testament in twelve Lan∣guages.</NOTE> other Languages: In Hebrew it is, in the Day of our LORD, in
<HI>Syriack,</HI> a Day of the LORD: So in Spanish, in a Day of the LORD. In Greek, the Participles have sometimes the force of the Nouns: So in English, the LORD's Day, or the Day of the LORD: as in the other instance, where the word is used, the LORD's Supper, or the Supper of the LORD. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 23-26.</NOTE> For which Supper we have evident express, both Institution, appointing of it, and com∣mand, injoyning us to do it; Promise making over and sealing the benefit of Christ's Death, to such as partake of it worthily, after a due sitting manner; and threatning, denouncing judgements against the profaners of this Ordinance: None of all which; either Institution, Command, Promise or Threatning, have we yet after all our search, found, for the first Day to be the Day of the weekly Sabbath, in the place of the seventh: so that, here is no foundation, for belief and practice to build upon. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17.

of the Spirit of <HI>Aelohim:</HI> And therefore the cause of the first day, as the weekly Sabbath, not having the whole Scripture profitable for the proving of it, cannot stand in the judgement, notwithstanding one misinterpreted Scripture, is yet further alledged to defend it; if the urger of it could be any Art plead it.</P>
<P>One historical hint more, this Objector doth suppose may be, with respect to the Day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> which he thinks was that year, on the first Day of the Week, when the pourings out of the holy Spirit were on the Apostles, and so thinks it to be the Day separated by the Apostles for holy Worship, especially in publick Church Assemblies: and yet he says, he was loth to name the day of the sending down of the Holy Ghost (<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">For a Ghost is taken to be the departed Spirit of a man (about which the Ethnick Philosophers had divers idolatrous, superstitious, observations, customs, practises and usages) p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly applyed to the Holy Spirit.</NOTE> Holy Spirit, it should have been said) was given as a proof, because that some do controvert it; but it seemeth to him a ve∣ry considerable thing.</P>
<P>I must therefore return somewhat in answer unto this. It is much of the Ar∣tifice in the present age, as in some other cases, so concerning the matter under debate, to darken and obscure some particular places of Scripture, either by corrupt Translations, or by false Interpretations, upon which to ground their wrong Inferences, and conjectural consequences; and then to perswade the plain people how deep these things do lie: and how much they should lean upon the Wisdom and Advice of their Church Guides who much study humane Histories for them, to lead them, through what? through those dark Mazes, in∣to which these Guides have misled them. Whereas, the Scriptures about the weekly Sabbath, are full of <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Prov. 8. 8, 9. Deut. 27. 1, 8.</NOTE> clear Light, and of satisfying self-evidence, to those who are made throughly willing to do the acceptable Will of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim.</HI> What conviction can there be brought in upon the understanding concerning any change of the weekly Sabbath-day, from the seventh to the first day of the week, where is not either expressed or implyed any thing at all of any such change; and where the Reader cannot find the first day spoken of, or hinted to, to any such purpose? The Passover is acknowledged by this Author, on this year of Christ's Death to be a Seventh-day Sabbath: If so, <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Lev. 23. 11-16.</NOTE> then including that day in the number of fifty, and seven Sabbaths reckoned and added to that day, <HI>Pentecost,</HI> or the fiftieth day, was a Seventh-day Sabbath also; (for, so was the computation, seven times seven, being forty and nine) the Passover going before, and being put to the seven sevennies, the last of those seven Sab∣bath-days was the fiftieth day, and a Seventh day Sabbath. As in the com∣puting the Jubilee year, there were seven times seven years, which addeth toge∣ther, do make up the number of forty nine years; which by reckoning of the former Jubilee year into the number, doth make up a fiftieth year; the last of those seven sevennies of years being the Jubilee year: For this honour did <HI>Jo∣hovah</HI> put upon the number of seven in the Scriptures, with respect to divers of his Institutions; the last day which was the seventh, being solemnly dignified, as in the weekly Sabbath, which is the last day in the week. And this, in the way, answereth that which some others do alledge for their first day; from such Scriptures, which do speak of an eighth day, and an eighth-days Sabbath, as a typical proof. As for that expression, relating to the Feast of Booths or Taber∣nacles, that lasted seven days; now that on the <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Lev. 23. 31, 36, 39. Numb. 29. 35.</NOTE> eighth day should be an holy Convocation, a solemn Assembly, a day of Restraint, a Sabbath: upon such a supposition that the first day of that Feast was the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, or at least when it so fell out to be and was so, then this eighth day, the day af∣ter this Feast must be a Seventh day Sabbath also. But whatever it were, as to that; the Scripture proofs for the observing of the Seventh-day, the last day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, are clear and full: For Objectors against this to pretend possibilities and probabilities of <HI>Aelohim</HI>'s declaring and signi∣fying of his mind about changing the day of the Sabbath, is a darkning of coun∣sel in words without knowledge, and a going off from Scripture-Light, to un∣scriptural darkness: For the Seventh-day Sabbath we have evident express commands and promises, to awe us, and to incourage us in the observation

Numb. 28. 1-10.</NOTE> place, where it is foretold, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the Priests shall make their Burnt-offerings upon the Altar: If the first of those seven days of sanctifying the Altar were a Seventh-day Sabbath, the eighth day was a Seventh-day Sabbath too: although I take the plain meaning of the so forward there, to set out the daily Offerings upon the Altar, the continual on every day: For the Seventh-day-Sabbath-worship is distinctly spoken of in an <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 46. 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> after part of that Prophesie. There are several sorts of <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 45. 17-25. &amp; 46. 2 -12.</NOTE> Times mentioned by this Prophet, Passover-time, New Moon-time, Booth-time, besides these Festival Times for Moons and Years, there is weekly Seventh-day Sabbath-time, which is one evident establishment of the last day of the week, for the continued weekly Sabbath-day, in the weekly returns of it, under the New Testament Dispensati∣on: For, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 46. 1.</NOTE> the Seventh-day Sabbath, was in the same week after the six work∣ing days, which were to go before in the same week, and for the continuing of the day from evening to evening: (and this Seventh-day Sabbath not being a Type, figure and shadow, as the Ceremonies of the old Dispensation were, but a natural, standing, confirmed, commanded, weekly Sabbath-day, from the first week of the created World:) And there is also daily time set forth for Evening and for the Morning-worship: and to this, doth <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezek.</HI> 43. 27. compare with this, <HI>ch.</HI> 46. 13, 14, 15.</NOTE> that place forementioned refer, as the Sacrifices do expresly declare. The Altar was seven days in purging, which doth denote the through purity of Spiritual Worship in the later days: The number of seven in Scripture, being a number of perfection, fulness and sufficiency: This being done and finished, they must be on the eighth, and so still onwards, on the ninth, tenth day and forward, continually as days come on, offer daily spiritual Sacrifices thereon. Thus have I shewn, as to the former Objector, that his pretended Historical hints, both severally, and apart by themselves, do make nothing at all for his purpose about his first day. They prove not any such usage for the matter of Fact, as to the separation of the first day, in the room of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, much less do they prove the matter of Right, which is the great thing here inquired after. And now if all of them be put together, and joyntly inforced, they speak as little for this as each of them severally, that is to say, not at all in favour of the first day, as a separated day for holy Worship: but do either speak of Festival Sabbaths of Passover, or the like, or of the Seventh-day Sabbaths; or of a Lordly provi∣dential day, which doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inot ngle out the first day of the week, in the weekly revolution, as the weekly Sabbath-day, how fain soever this Author would have it so to be. I know no signal note put upon the first Day of the Week, as the Day of Rest, or solemn Worship, in the New Testament: The places have been examined, and do set out and signifie another day. And were there an exact literal version, according to the true proper significancy of the Words, I do not remember any one place all the New Testament through, where there is so much, as that particular expression, of the First day of the Week, much less as applyed unto a Day of Rest, or solemn Worship, or weekly Sabbath.</P>
<P>Having thus far cleared the way of such stumbling blocks, which some have cast before us in our Seventh-day Sabbath journey, there is another stone thrown before me, which I am to remove, and that is, an Argument for the First Day, brought in as a Proof of the cessation of the Seventh-day Sabbath, by a misin∣terpreted, misapplyed place in the Epistle to the <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> Hebrews: which I am now to examine more at large.</P>
<P>That a clear and a full Answer unto this Objection, may be the more freely and readily received, I shall first give in some lines the plain meaning and scope of this Scripture; and then further discover, that the Day expressed in the <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Psal. 95. 7-11.</NOTE> <HI>Psalm,</HI> and referred unto in the Epistle to the <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 7, 13. 15. &amp; 4. 7. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Hebrews,</HI> is not to be under∣stood of the First Day of the Week, in the weekly returns of it, so as to shut out all and every of the other days of the week: and particularly as to this of Rest, excluding the seventh day from being the weekly Sabbath for Christians to observe, under the New Testament Administration of Grace; that the Rest spoken of in that <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Psal. 95. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Psalm,</HI> and transferred from thence into this <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 11, 18. &amp; 4. 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10. 11.</NOTE> Epistle, is not

Then, that the, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 10.</NOTE> <HI>He</HI> mentioned in one passage in this Epi∣stle, is meant of the Believer: After that, I shall shew wherein <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 10.</NOTE> the parallel doth not hold, and wherein it doth: What the <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 10.</NOTE> Works are which Believers are said to Rest from: What the force of the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 10. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Conjunction is in this place: What the change of the Number, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 9, 10.</NOTE> from the Plural to the Singular, may import.</P>
<P>As for the meaning and scope of this Scripture in this Epistle. The Conside∣rate Reader is desired (after his serious seeking of the LORD, by the prayer of Faith, to be taught of Him, and to be led into the Truth) diligently to observe, how the Aim and Design of this Epistle <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 3. 7 &amp; onwards to the <HI>11th. vers.</HI> of the <HI>4th. chap.</HI></NOTE> in this part of it, is to confirm and e∣stablish the professing Hebrews in the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 1, 6, 24, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE> Faith and Doctrine of the LORD Jesus Christ; which would be the better done, if they hearkened unto what Christ had said in a both Historical and Prophetical <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Psal. 95. 7.</NOTE> Psalm to this purpose; and to caution and charge them <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 12, 13.</NOTE> against an evil heart of Unbelief, that would fall off from the Living God, and harden them through the seducingness of that sin; that he might the more speedily and thorowly awaken and quicken them up to attend un∣to, and to follow his spiritual and wholsome Counsel, which was so seasonable, in such a time, when they were so persecuted for their Discipleship to Christ: He sheweth what dangerous Evils were near, and what great Mischiefs would fol∣low; if they did give way to their unbelief, distrust and carnal fear, they would then backslide from their Heavenly Calling, and from their Holy Profession: And if they did live and did in such a state, of unbelief and of unperswadedness, of unrepentingness and of disobedience, they would be shut out of that Spiritual, Heavenly, Eternal <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4 1.</NOTE> Rest of God in Christ. And that his manner of Arguing might be the more convincing and prevailing, he brings a strong evident proof of it out of <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psal. 95. 11.</NOTE> one of the Psalms; it being that Scripture, which the Author of this Epistle doth Comment upon, and expound here: Where the Holy Spirit, by the Prophet <HI>David</HI> (who penned <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 7. &amp; 4. 7. <HI>compared with</HI> Psal. 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> that Psalm for him) having exhorted the <HI>Israel</HI> of God, to laud <HI>Jehovah,</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">The <HI>95th.

For the preventing of which Exclusion, that his speech might come with the more weight upon their spirits, <HI>David</HI> doth bring in <HI>Aelohim</HI> him∣self; exhorting the people, that they would not follow the bad Example of their Fore-fathers, who were not of a Teachable Mind, nor of a Practical Understan∣ding, nor of an Inclinable Will, nor of an Obedient Carriage; and so die away <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>n</HI> Heb. 11. 16.</NOTE> in their Wilderness-state. This dreadful Example he <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 12-1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. &amp; 4. 1, 2, 6, 11.</NOTE> makes use of to awe the Christian Hebrews in his Day, unto an abiding st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dfast in the Christian Religion; lest otherwise, they also did fall after the same Example of unbelief and of diso∣bedience; and so loytered behind and came not safe-full-home to the Heavenly Rest. That the forcibleness of his right Arguing words might not be abated by any who would be Replying, that there were other Rests besides the Heavenly Rest, which also were spoken of in the Word of God; as if it may be the Psal∣mist spake of one or other of those Rests, and not of that Spiritual, Eternal, Hea∣venly Rest; therefore he reckons up several kinds of Rests: There was the Rest of the Seventh-day Sabbath: This the Prophet <HI>David</HI> did not particularly mean in that Psalm, because this Rest of the Seventh-day Sabbath was <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 3, 4. <HI>cut of</HI> Gen. 2. 2, 3.</NOTE> from the foun∣dation of the World, the last day of the first created Week. Which therefore, being from the beginning thus honoured, both by <HI>Aelohim</HI>'s Word, and in its own Created Nature, must remain the Weekly Sabbath-Day to the end of the World: And this Rest, as to the outward part at least, of keeping the Seventh day as the only Weekly Sabbath-day, they in <HI>David</HI>'s time had already actually entred upon in the Weekly returns of it. Further, There was the Rest of and in

Psal 95. 11.</NOTE> of another Day after those things in a prophetical manner, and of another Rest, than either of the two forementioned, the Seventh-day Sabbath Rest, or the <HI>Canaan</HI> Rest: nei∣ther could it be meant of any other Rest, by any Enumeration of any other parti∣cular, but only of the Spiritual, Eternal Heavenly Rest of and with a God in Christ; If any thought, that that passage in the <HI>Psalm</HI> might be understood of any other Rest, but this Heavenly one, the Author of this Epistle would readily have demon∣strated the mistake. The Rest that <HI>David</HI> spake of, out of which <HI>Jehovah</HI> Christ from his Father, by his Spirit, in his Word threatned confirmingly by an Oath, to shut the unbelieving, and unrepenting, the disobedient and the unperswadable, they living and dying such, was such a Rest, as those who were in a state of unbelief, were not actually possessed of: A Rest in a Promise, a Rest yet fur∣ther to come, offered and tendered unto them, set plainly and openly in a Wor. Revelation before them, if they did not by their own affected ignorance, and wilful transgression exclude themselves out of it. <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 1, 3, 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> A Rest, into which sound Believers had entred, did and should enter, and so cease from their own works. Seeing therefore, that there yet further remaineth such a Rest, so glorious a Sab∣batism, for the people of God, he presseth the professing Hebrews to study and endeavour how to enter into <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 1. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> this promised Rest, by yielding the due Obedience of Faith in and unto Christ.</P>
<P>Having thus opened and applyed the Scriptures, that we might look the deeper, and see the clearer into the sense and scope of it, I am next to shew, that the Day (to Day, or this Day) expressed in the <HI>Psalm,</HI> and referred unto in the Epistle is not to be understood of the First Day of the Week, in the weekly returns of it; so as to shut out all and every of the other Days of the Week, and particularly as to this of Rest, excluding the Seventh day from being the weekly Sabbath for Christians to observe under the New Testament Administrati∣on of Grace.</P>
<P>Of this, I give these Reasons, grounded upon Scripture, because that Day, which is spoken of in that <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Psal. 95. 7. Heb. 3. 7 13, 15. &amp; 4. 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Psalm,</HI> and made use of in this Epistle, is such a Day as doth take in <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 13.</NOTE> every Day in the Week; as the Author himself doth interpret, in the same Epistle, speaking of the same Day, in this very ease and instance now under debate; where he puts the Christian Hebrews upon the faithful discharge of that Gospel-fellowship-duty of mutually exhorting one another daily, or according to every Day, as the Duty of every Day was, when they had occasion and opportunity, so to do, whilst it is called to Day, this Day, and the next, and still the next after that, every Day; whilst Grace is offered, and whilst your time doth last; whilst Christ's Voice from his Father doth speak unto you; and whilst the Spirit of Christ, in the Word and Ministry thereof, doth call upon you. That Hodiernal Day, of which the Holy Spirit doth make mention in this Exhortation, has its duration full home to this our Day, and it appertaineth no less unto us, than it did unto in <HI>David</HI>'s time. For the Illa∣tive Conjunction Therefore, in the beginning of the seventh Verse of the third Chapter doth properly belong, to Take heed, in the beginning of the twelfth Verse; as went before, and so must be here understood: Therefore, as the holy Spirit exhorted your Fathers to obedience, under pain of exclusion from the Rest of God, so see ye well unto it, that you yield obedience, lest otherwise, you also be shut out of the same Holy, Heavenly Rest.</P>
<P>The Seventh-day is in this place mentioned with a double mark of Honour put upon it, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 3, 4.</NOTE> that Day, that Seventh: The Law concerning the Seventh-day Rest, or Sabbath, <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> was given to <HI>Adam</HI> from the beginning, and put into Created

Being, in the first Week of the Created World, and is therefore unchangeable, still standing in its due Force, and in its full Authority: Whereas, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 7-19. &amp; 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-11.</NOTE> in all this passage of this Epistle, there is no mention made of the First Day, either in ex∣press words, or by any necessary consequence: So that I may use the force of Christ's Reason, and the strength of his Argument here, (which he did in <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Mat. 19. 4, 8.</NOTE> another case, bearing yet a very clear like date from the founding of the World) from the beginning, the First Day of the Week was not the Sabbath: whereas the Seventh day was made, Instituted, and appointed for the Day of weekly Rest, the same Week of the Creation, when the foundations of the World were laid, and when the Glorious Creator did set up his great Works. The Day thereof prefixed by <HI>David,</HI> must in this case be some other kind of Day, even <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 7.

<P>Further, The Rest mentioned in both these places, in that <HI>Psalm,</HI> and in this Epistle, was such a Rest as the people (to whom <HI>David</HI> and the Author of this Epistle did write this) had not as yet Then entred into; they were not posses∣sed of it whilst they remained in a State of unbelief, neither ever would <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 1, 11.</NOTE> if they passed into the other World in that State of Unbelief, impenitence, disobe∣dience, and unperswadableness. What Rest can then be named for the People of <HI>David</HI>'s Time, (as is proved in the fore cited place of this Epistle, in the Margin) to enter into, but only that Spiritual, Eternal Rest of, with, and in <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the <HI>Messiah?</HI> As for the Rest of the Weekly-Sabbath, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2, 3. Heb. 4. 3, 4.</NOTE> That was from the Founda∣tion of the World, when God Rested from All His Works on the Seventh Day; and accordingly blessed and sanctified that Particular Day, as the Day of the Weekly Sabbath. The <HI>Syriack</HI> and the <HI>Aethiopick</HI> Languages do express the Se∣venth Day by the word Sabbath, in the fourth Verse of this fourth Chapter. And this Rest, at least as to the outward part of it, was Entred upon by the <HI>Israelites</HI> in <HI>David</HI>'s time, and <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 22-30. &amp; 20. 8-11.</NOTE> by their Forefathers long before.</P>
<P>The Rest mentioned in the forecited places of this Epistle is such a Rest as he and others had a Probability, as well as Possibility, (though with difficulty and stu∣diousness) to enter yet into, unless by their own unbelief and hardening of their Heart they did <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 1-11.</NOTE> fall short of it. <HI>Let Ʋs fear: Ʋs;</HI> He includes Himself; Whereas if the First-day-rest, pretended from hence to be the Christians Weekly-Sabbath, had been the Rest here meant, what difficulty or studiousness was there as to their entring upon this, so far at least, as to the External Duty and Privi∣lege? and especially, as to the particular Case of the Author of this Epistle, and of other of the Believing among those Hebrews in his Day, who are supposed by these Objecters, to have already entred upon the First-Day-Rest that is preten∣ded; which Author so earnestly exhorted the Hebrews to Enter upon the same Rest? For we are to observe, that he joyneth himself with the Hebrews to quick∣en up himself as well as them unto an Holy Fear, lest <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Heb 4. 1, 11.</NOTE> he and they otherwise fell short of the Promised Rest through want of due diligence, and through careless
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>
negligence, though he himself reckon himself among the <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3.</NOTE> Believers: He in∣forceth his exhortation by this Argument amongst others, in the fourteenth Verse of the third Chapter, drawn from a very profitable effect of it, even from the consortship, and society, and fellowship, that such will have with Christ in that heavenly inheritance; if they retain firm even unto the end, that beginning of confidence or subsistence; (<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> by which, Faith is described in this Epistle.) As for any partakership of Christ, in a way of conformity to him, with respect to the observation of weekly Sabbath-day, it could have no relation to the First Day of the Week, which Day Christ observed not as a Sabbath, but through the whole of his life kept the Seventh day, as the weekly Sabbath-day.</P>
<P>The great Design of this Epistle, (the same thing which doth run all the Scripture through, where occasion is given and taken, to speak of this matter) is to prove, that a state of unbelief, lived, layn, and dyed in, will shut the guilty of it, out of the sweet satisfying injoyment of the True, Spiritual, Eternal, Hea∣venly Rest: For, to this particular purpose is it, that he fetcheth his proof out of that <HI>Psalm,</HI> confirming what he had said by the Testimony of <HI>David,</HI> shewing that the Psaimist by that Rest, could mean nothing else, and nothing less, but the Spiritual, Eternal, heavenly Rest: there being no other Rest left, out of which the unbelieving were threatned to be shut in that <HI>Psalm,</HI> called so great a Salva∣tion, in the third Verse of the second Chapter of this Epistle: The Rest of the weekly Sabbath had been entred upon already; and as for the <HI>Canaan</HI> Rest, that was some ages before <HI>David</HI>'s Time, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 8. Act. 7. 45.</NOTE> entred upon and into, by the surviving Israelites, under the leading of <HI>Joshuah,</HI> or Jesus; or, if you will, of <HI>Jeshuang,</HI> or Jesus by <HI>Joshuah.</HI> Whereas, the Rest promised here, in the first verse of the fourth Chapter, was such a Rest, as <HI>Joshuah</HI> did not bring the Israelites into, in the eighth Verse, though he led them into <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Type of it; as the causal conjunction doth evidently prove, which is an Answer to a tacit Objection, if any did say, that <HI>Joshua</HI> had placed the Fathers in that Rest. As for that <HI>Ca∣naan</HI> Rest, it was actually possest by <HI>David,</HI> and the Israelites of his Day: This Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> is called the Land of <HI>Immanuel, Isai.</HI> 8. 8. that is of Christ, be∣cause it was a sign of the Heavenly Inheritance obtained by Christ, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 9, 11. The Rest therefore, that <HI>David</HI> speaks of, must be a Rest yet to come: (The other Rests particularly mentioned having been already then entred into;) a Rest, which they should fear, they might be shut out from, a Rest, not past, but yet to come.</P>
<P>This Epistle speaks of Believers entring into this promised Rest, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 10.</NOTE> after their working season is at an end; appears by comparing some <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Vers. 1, 2, 3, 9. &amp; 11. <HI>with</HI> vers. 10.</NOTE> Verses in this place together: at least, as to the full possession of that Rest: If it should be pleaded by the Objectors, from <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Vers. 3. Mat. 11. 28, 29. <HI>and</HI> Iohn 3. 36. <HI>and</HI> 1 John 5. 12, 13.</NOTE> one of the Verses compared with other Scriptures, that sound Believers do actually injoy some beginning of it here: this we are per∣swaded of, and experienced Believers are supposed in <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Psal. 116. 7. Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24. &amp; 10. 34. 2 Pet. 1. 11.</NOTE> Scripture, to have already somewhat of it, as well as to hope for more of it here; and to believe, and expect their full everlasting possession of it in the heavenly Glory, at the last, when they have here finished that Work which the LORD sent them into the World to do: and this is their every days happiness, more or less, as they more or less act as Believers. O how often may the Spirit of a Believer be in the Heaven∣ly Rest in one Day! He may get thither into this Rest, in one Holy Thought: and how many of such thoughts may his thoughts be, who thus doth act Faith, Hope and Love aright, upon this Object! A sound Believer should check himself under his divertisements from this Felicity, Return, O my Soul, to thy-my-Rests: My Rests are thy Rests; thy Rests are my Rests: Be friendly to me and to thy self: Sit down and silently Rest in <HI>Jehovah Aelohim!</HI> There is an abundant en∣trance subministred to thee, to me, so to do!</P>
<P>This Epistle, in <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 8.</NOTE> one passage of this cited place do prove, that Jesus or <HI>Jo∣shuah</HI> (For <HI>Joshuah,</HI> or <HI>Jehoshuang,</HI> in the <HI>Syriack</HI> Language, and also by the Greeks, denoteth a Saviour) had not then given them that Rest, spoken of in that <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Psal. 95.</NOTE> <HI>Psalm</HI> referred to: because then the Psalmist would not afterward have spoken of another Day: and therefore that Rest which <HI>Joshuah</HI> or Jesus, or Je∣sus by <HI>Joshuah</HI> set them in, was not this Rest it self, but a Type of this heavenly
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>
rest to believers, for, many entred into <HI>Canaan,</HI> who never entred into Heaven. <HI>Joshua</HI> had not given them that rest which is here spoken of; So that this can∣not be understood of the rest of the first day of the week, as the weekly Sab∣bath-day, seeing the Objectors do affirm, though groundlesly, and but pretend∣edly, that the Captain Jesus (of whom <HI>Joshuah</HI> was someways a Type:) gave his Disciples this first day rest.</P>

Rev. 14. 13.</NOTE> other Scriptures set out by the Name of God's Rest: This was Typified by the Ark, and by the Temple, and by <HI>Canaan;</HI> and is plain enough spoken of in this passage to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> God's rest is in the highest Heavens, there is the dwelling place of his Rest: There doth Christ sit in Glory at the right hand of his Father in full, perfect, happy Rest, where sound Believers also shall rest, in, and with Him. For <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 14.</NOTE> a little after this passage we are told Christ's Rest is, in the Heavens, in the highest Heavens, the Holy of Holies: So <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9 24.</NOTE> else∣where in the same Epistle: We, saith he, have a great High Priest who is gone thorow into the Heavens, Jesus the Son of God: and therefore let us hold fast our Christian profession: For, Christ is not entred into the Sanctuary that is made with hands, which is an Antitype of the true, that is of the Heavenly Sanctuary, which was Figured by the other, but into Heaven it self, now to appear before the face of God for us, with full satisfaction made to the Justice of his Father, by the Sacrifice of himself offered up to his Father, and with pre∣vailing Intercession for those whom the Father gave unto him. So that, as <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 11. 18. &amp; 4. 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> his rest is divers times mentioned in this <HI>Epistle;</HI> so also is <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 24. &amp; 10. 34. &amp; 11. 16. &amp; 12. 22, 23, 25.</NOTE> Heaven often ex∣presly mentioned, besides other words that do set it out: and there is likewise <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Heb. 6. 19. 20. &amp; 9 12, 21, 25.</NOTE> the phrase of thus entring in, several times spoken of: All these in the same Epistle; <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 6, 7. &amp; 10. 19 <HI>(compared with</HI> Levit. 16. 2, 3, 23.)

So that, all these ex∣pressions thus put together, which we do meet withal in the same Epistle do best reconcile this sense, to the whole of the Epistle besides, and to other Scriptures which do treat of the same Subject-matter, that, the entring in, the Ingress into this rest, is the entring into the Heavenly rest above. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 1. &amp; 4. a. &amp; 6. 19, 20. &amp; 12, 22, 23, 24.</NOTE> Some beginnings of which Heavenly rest Believers do enter into here, in that holy Heavenly Fellow∣ship which they have with <HI>Jehohah Aelohim</HI> in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and with the living Members of Christ's mystical Body; Jesus the fore-runner being already entred into the innermost of the veil for them, the Believers hope has a way of entring in there after him. We have Ordinances now dispensed, with more clearness, Spirituality, and Heavenliness, then Believers under the former Administration had, (though they also enjoyed the same for sum, and for sub∣stance, yet under Types, Shadows, and Figures:) And therefore they are called <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 1. &amp; 6. 4. &amp; 8. 5. &amp; 9. 23.</NOTE> Heavenly things, which the pattern of Old did more darkly resemble. These are not forced sences, and interpretations of my own, but such as are Natural and Familiar, Plain and Obvious, and in the express Language and literal words of the same Epistle.</P>
<P>Before I quite dismiss this about the rest, I am to write somewhat about the significancy of the word <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>from</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Sabbatism. The Greek Noun is derived from a Verb, which doth signific, I Sabbatize, or I rest. The seventy two Greek Inter∣preters do use the Verb in <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Lev. 26. 35.</NOTE> one Scripture, where it doth set out the rest of the Land every seventh year: they use it also in <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 30.</NOTE> another place, where it is applyed to the Seventh-day-Sabbath, that being the weekly Sabbatizing-day, or resting-day. The Greek Noun in the proper significancy of the Word, is an actual or active resting or Cessation from work, or labour, or from motion about such work, and labour as is rested from, a Requietion, or Requiescence from this; This being used in the Greek of the New Testament but once, the means to come to a right apprehension of the true signification and the proper meaning of it in this place, will be to examine, what the Original of this Greek Word is, in that Language from whence it is borrowed in the Old Testament Hebrew; and what that word in the Hebrew Original doth contain and express in it; How that word is used in the Scriptures, from whence this Greek Noun hath its Ori∣gination,
<PB N="75" REF="42"/>
as also, what there is in the Context of this place in this part of the E∣pistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> about this matter enquired after? What there is in that Psalm, referred to here in this Epistle, that may bring some light to this matter? And what there is in the Word of Christ about this Phrase of Sabbath-keeping or keeping a Sabbath, as the Objector doth render it.</P>
<P>It is not here unworthy of our noting, That, the Greek Tongue in a multitude of Words has its Origination from the Hebrew Language: Its Alphabet and Letters hath its derivation from hence. What is its <HI>Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta,</HI> but <HI>Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth?</HI> the power and force, the vertue and value in the sound for the manner of pronunciation is much the same: and <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>As</HI> Erebos <HI>darkness, from the Hebrew,</HI> Gne∣reb. Sophol <HI>from</HI> Sophim: Arra∣bon <HI>from</HI> Gnar∣bon. Momos <HI>from</HI> Mum. Heli∣os <HI>from</HI> Ael.

Me∣shane <HI>from</HI> Me∣chaneh Tauros <HI>from</HI> Tormanie <HI>more might be added.</HI></NOTE> many par∣ticular words do in their very sound declare, though in some things the Greek Tongue is defective, at least as now it is in use: particularly in that it wants a Jod Consonant, as also in that it has not an H in the middle or in the end of a word: which is the reason why we so seldom meet with the Word of Words, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or <HI>Jah,</HI> or <HI>Ehieh,</HI> in the Greek of the New Testament, though the ci∣tations brought out of the Old into the New, have often the word <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and <HI>Jah</HI> expressed. The Original of this Greek word <HI>Sabbatismos,</HI> or Sabbatism, is from the Hebrew word <HI>Shabbaton,</HI> as the Greek <HI>Sabbaton</HI> is from the Hebrew <HI>Shabath:</HI> The sound and the sense going together do enough speak this to every intelligent Man's Ear: Thus in <HI>Chaldee, Syriack,</HI> and <HI>Arabick, Shebath</HI> is a Sab∣batism. <HI>Shabbathon,</HI> or <HI>Shabbaton,</HI> which is the Original of that Greek word <HI>Sabbatismos,</HI> or Sabbatism, doth sometimes set out the <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Exod. 16. 23.</NOTE> Seventh-day-Sabbath, or rest; which Seventh day is expressed by this word, as one of its Names and Appellations by which it is called. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Levit. 23. 24.</NOTE> Sometimes the first day of the seventh Moon is expressed by this word: <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Levit. 25 4, 5.</NOTE> at another time, the seventh year has that denomination: and <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Lev. 16. 29, 31.</NOTE> the day of explation also, on the tenth day of the seventh Moon is so stiled: The reason whereof is, that these days and years were observed as Sabbaths, when there was an Actual rest, a cessation from Work and Labour.</P>
<P>The Context in this place of this Epistle doth evidence that what is expressed by Sabbatism <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> in one Verse, is in other Verses relating to the same matter, called hy <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Heb. 2. 11, 18. &amp; 4. 1, 3, 10, 11. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> another word, which is a resting, reposing, a cessation, a rest from labour, a ceasing from work: Which two words much denoting one and the same thing here, rest, resting, Sabbatism, or Sabbatizing-rest, are both of them in this place distinguished and severed <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 4.</NOTE> from the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, to be obser∣ved here now; Whereas the other promised is yet remaining to be enjoyed.</P>
<P>This discourse being grounded upon the ninty fifth <HI>Psalm,</HI> it is observable, that the word used there, in the last verse, is <HI>Menuchah,</HI> rest, quietness, a quiet rest, an acquiescing from <HI>Nuach,</HI> he rested, he was quiet, he was at rest, he acquiesced. A place of quiet, and of quiet rest, in that place of the <HI>Psalm,</HI> is set out by that word <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Numb. 14. &amp; Chron. 10. 33.</NOTE> relating to a former passage in <HI>Moses</HI> time: The Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was a place of quiet rest, when peaceably possessed by the <HI>Israelites;</HI> And it was a Ty∣pical Figure of the promised rest and Sabbatism mentioned in this place of this Epistle: <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Menuchah, Ps. 95. 11.</NOTE> Which word is applyed to several other things besides the weekly Sabbath: <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Deut. 12. 9.</NOTE> As it is the word used, to set out the shadowy rest in the Land of <HI>Canaan:</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 22. 9.</NOTE> It is applyed to a Man, a Man of rest: <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">1 Chron 28. 2.</NOTE> It is attributed to an House, an House of rest: <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Psal. 23. 2.</NOTE> It is ascribed to Waters; Waters of rest, of rests: and to divers things distinct and different from the weekly Sabbath-day, or resting day, as such.</P>
<P>As for the phrase of keeping Sabbath, the Scriptures do usually add some other word unto Sabbath, whereby to denote that expressiveness; <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Exod 20. 8. &amp; 31. 13, 16. Deut. 5, 12.</NOTE> Such as, to remem∣ber a Sabbath-day; to this end of sanctifying it: To sanctifie a Sabbath, to keep Sabbaths, to do the Sabbath, and such like. And some such phrases are applyed unto somewhat else, besides the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath: As <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Lev. 25. 2, 3, 4. &amp; 26. 44.</NOTE> to Sabbatize a Sabbath; which was on the seventh year: thus to enjoy, or to accept, or to will Sabbaths, meaning the seventh years.</P>
<P>The next particular, which I expressed, that I would discover is, that, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 10.</NOTE> the, He, mentioned in one passage of this part of this Epistle, is meant of the Believer. The grounds why I so apprehend are as follow: Because</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="43"/>
The tenth Verse of this fourth Chapter doth resume that which was spoken of in the third Verse: in both which there is express mention made of the same rest, and of the same persons, in some of the same expressions, where believing ones are said to enter into that rest: The, He, is every such He, as is believing, and all such.</P>
<P>The ninth Verse is an inference from the sixth Verse, and it hath respect unto that: by a corollary he forceth the remainingness of a rest to the people of God. Which rest is defined in the tenth Verse by Believers cessation from his works: and this Definition is Illustrated by a collation of the example of God, who then rested when he ceased from his works. Seeing therefore, it remaineth some to enter into that rest, there remaineth therefore a Sabbatism to the peo∣ple of God. It must evidently follow, that, seeing the unperswadeable ones, to whom this was first Evangelized; (or to whom the Gospel was first preach∣ed,) did not enter into the Typical rest of <HI>Canaan,</HI> therefore there is a rest yet still behind, which the believing people of God have a promise of entring into, in the first Verse: which is Typilied by that Prophetical word in the fifty ninth <HI>Psalm:</HI> of which more in the next reason.</P>
<P>The Sabbatism, or rest spoken of, in the ninth and tenth Verses of this fourth Chapter, is that which being Typified doth answer directly unto the Type there∣of: This Type in the eleventh Verse of the nineth fifth <HI>Psalm,</HI> was the Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> which is called <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Deut. 12. 9, 10. 1 Chron. 23. 25.</NOTE> a rest, out of which those of the <HI>Israelites</HI> who were twenty years old and upward were shut, such as were <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Numb. 14. 24, 28, 29, 30. Heb. 3. 22. 19.</NOTE> unbelieving, murmuring, and unperswadeable, who revolted from <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> and in their heart returned back again into <HI>Egypt.</HI> Their evil heart of unbelief made them de∣part from the living God: Those of them who were believing as <HI>Caleb,</HI> and <HI>Joshuah,</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Numb. 14. 24. Deut. 1. 36. Jo∣shua 14. 6, 7, 8. Numb. 32. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Caleb</HI> has a remark of He, put upon him, as the He, eminently, that had another Spirit with him, and that did fulfill after <HI>Jehovah</HI> Christ: and <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Numb. 14. 30. &amp; 32. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Joshuah</HI> was another such He. These and such as these, did enter into that Ty∣pifying rest; where, after they had driven out their Enemies, they enjoyed a peaceable rest and a quiet safety. This Typical rest in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> did not Figure out a first day weekly Sabbath rest; into which day, as into a rest∣ing day weekly, none of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> either unbelieving or believing did enter upon, as an <HI>Hebdomadal.</HI> Sabbath: But it did Typifie that rest, in the better, the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 9. 16.</NOTE> Heavenly Countrey; as is expressed in this same Epistle; into which none do enter but the believing: So that the, He, who entring into the rest of God, in the tenth Verse, is any one of the Believing people of God, for whom the pro∣mised Sabbatism was said to be remaining, in the words immediately foregoing, in the ninth Verse; Which also the reason brought to prove the soundness of the inference doth shew: The Illative particle, therefore, and the comparative, like as, in the seventh Verse of the third Chapter, relating to the twelfth Verse of the same Chapter, doth shew the exhortation to be inforced upon the Belie∣ver, therefore as the Holy Spirit exhorteth you to believe and obey the Voice of Christ, so look to it, that you do believe and obey his Voice; The reason is strong, from an example of old, because your Fathers who contemned the Voice of Christ, and did not contemper the word with Faith, were frustrated of the Heavenly rest: The reason of which consequence, is, seeing there is the like reason of you and of them: For, both to you and them it was Evangelized; in the second Verse of the fourth Chapter. The whole drift of the Discourse from the seventh Verse of the third Chapter, to the eleventh Verse of the fourth Chapter, doth respect a professing people, that would pass for the people of God, and be accounted Travellers towards the promised Heavenly rest, which none but the believing perswadeable obedient true spiritual Israel of God would enter into.</P>
<P>The Sabbatism or rest spoken of, in the first, third, ninth, tenth, and eleventh, verses of this fourth Chapter, is a rest that remaineth; in the sixth and ninth verses of the same Chapter: A rest that was before them, towards which they were travelling, and short of which they should fear, lest they came by their loy∣tering behind; in the first Verse; A rest that in the time of the Authour of this Epistle, when he wrote this, was as to himself and the believing people of
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>
God then alive, before them, and they were left behind it, as yet short of it: Into which they were not as then so fully entred: but they were under a pro∣mise or expectation thereof: And the same may be said of his believing people, who are now alive in the present day, whilst it is called, to day: There is a promised rest, which they should have in their eye, which they are not as yet, so thorowly passed into; Of which that place in the <HI>Psalm</HI> was a Typical predicti∣on. The rest here, is a rest yet in the promise, yet to come and hoped for, at∣tainable, enterable and enjoyable, if <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 1, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> unperswadeableness hinder not. The Ele∣venth verse doth again introduce and enforce the principal exhortation by way of rational inferehee, and by a doubled Argument: Therefore let us study to enter into that rest, that, not any one sall by the same example of disobedience: If we believe and obey Christ's Voice we shall then enter into it, but if not, we shall be shut out from it; as those were who died away in their unperswadeable∣ness. The whole Context, both in this place, and in the <HI>Psalm,</HI> doth evidently demonstrate, that, the rest here treated of, and foretold by <HI>David,</HI> is such a rest, as out of which the unbelieving, unperswadeable, and disobedient, living and dying such, would be shut; and into which, the believing, perswadeable, and obedient, such a people of God should enter; and none but such: Which there∣fore cannot be ineant of a pretended first day of weekly rest. For, if that had been the rest, the believing had already actually entred, into, not only the out∣ward, but also the inward rest: and even the unbelieving had actually entred into the outward part of that rest; had they so far observed it as the weekly Sab∣bath: Whereas the <HI>Israelites</HI> in Type in <HI>Moses</HI>'s time, had not entred so much as into the outward part of the Type of it: That is to say, not those of them who were above twenty years of Age, when the Spies returned from searching the Land; All, except <HI>Joshuah</HI> and <HI>Caleb,</HI> died short of <HI>Canaan,</HI> that were above that number of years, whether Believers or unbelievers.</P>
<P>All the Promises, and the Threatnings, the Exhortations, and the Cautions, and such like, that are made use of, in all <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 7-19. &amp; 4. 1-11.</NOTE> this Discourse, do plainly relate to a prosessing people; according as they believe, or believe not, and so do enter, or not enter, into this rest.</P>
<P>As for what doth concern the parallel, wherein it doth not hold, and wherein it doth hold, I shall open now my thoughts.</P>
<P>The Parallel here, is not between God the Father, as Creator, and his Son Christ as Redeemer: (though there are some others that would have it so:) For the LORD Jesus himself, the Christ, the Mediator, was the Creator: (not exclu∣ding the Father, nor the Holy Spirit:) As I have proved <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Pag. 89. 90, 91, 92, 93.</NOTE> before in this Treatise: and have here again put some of the Scriptures into the <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">John 1. 1, 2, 3, 10. &amp; 5. 17, 19. 1 Cor. 8. 6. Ephes. 3. 9. Col. 1. 16, 17.</NOTE> Margin, which the Reader may examine, if he have need. The Authour of this Epistle doth in∣dustriously prove and promote this great Truth, of Christ's <HI>Jehovah</HI> ship, or God-ship, by his Creator-ship as well as by other Arguments from Scripture. That God who is spoken of in the tenth verse of this fourth Chapter of this E∣pistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> is the same Christ, by whom the Father made the Worlds, the Ages: He was the LORD in the beginning, who laid the Foundation of the Earth and the works of whose hands the Heavens were: as is declared in the second and tenth Verses of the first Chapter; the same God who built all things, in the fourth verse of the third Chapter: Which doth make way for the follow∣ing discourse, concerning his rest, and entring, or not entring into it, as Christian Professors did believe and obey, or not; As this Objector himself doth else∣where confess, upon the tenth Verse of the third Chapter: that, Christ is so brought in as God, and expresly called God, to make way for this following dis∣course about works and rest; The same God, whose voice from his Father, by his Spirit in his Word, the <HI>Israelites</HI> of Old, and the <HI>Hebrews</HI> in this Authour's time were called upon to hearken unto, in the seventh, and fifteenth Verses of that third Chapter. The same living God, from whom, they should take heed, lest by an evil Heart of unbelief in them, they did depart in the twelfth Verse: Which the Authour doth expresly interpret of Christ in the fourteenth Verse, The same God, who was tempted, provoked, grieved, disbelieved, by the <HI>Israelites</HI> in the Wil∣derness, in the eighth, ninth, tenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth Verses of this

Exod. 14 19. &amp; 23 20 Isai. 03. 9. <HI>compared.</HI></NOTE> elsewhere, in the Word; the same God who did rest the Seventh-day from all his Works, which were finished from the foundation of the World; in the third and fourth Verses of the fourth Chapter: The same God who has a people more pecularly belonging unto him, in the ninth Verse: The same God whose Word is quick and powerful, or living and active; and sharper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul, and of Spirit, and of the Joynts, or Nerves, and Mar∣row, and is a critical discerner, or a Critick of the imaginations and thoughts of the Heart; in the twelfth Verse: hold forth also in <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 3. 16.

The same God, who is the great high Priest of his People; passed into the Hea∣vens; (as into the full Rest;) Jesus the Son of God; in the fourteenth Verse.</P>
<P>Neither is the parallel between the Works of the Father, and the Works of the Son; as if they were such different Works, of a different Nature, and of diffe∣rent Time: which was not the matter under debate, in the third and fourth Chapters of this Epistle (as men have divided them;) the which what was men∣tioned before doth also discover; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">John 5. 17, 19.</NOTE> For, what things soever the Father doth, these also doth the Son likewise.</P>
<P>Nor is the parallel between one Day of the Week, and another Day of the Week, and the first Day of the Week, in the weehly Revolution. For the, <HI>to day,</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Psalm,</HI> and the seventh Verse, doth not point out the particular first Day of the Week; as distinct from the others Days of the same Week: As if the Exhortation did peculiarly, properly and openly, belong unto that; but it takes in the whole of our Day and Time, wherein the sound of Christ's Voice comes unto us; speaking by his Spirit in his Word from his Fa∣ther every Day of the Week; as appears from the thirteenth Verse of the third Chapter. So that those expressions in the seventh and eighth Verses of the fourth Chapter, which do speak of a <HI>certain day, and of another day,</HI> do set out a large providential Day, a long time after the Israelites entring into <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Land of Rest: The Rest spoken of in the <HI>Psalm,</HI> could not refer to this; or the weekly Sabbath from the Worlds Creation; for these were before; whereas the Psalmist doth speak of a Rest that was future, and yet to come; as to those who were then alive: As likewise it was to the Author of this Epistle, and to the Believers in his Day and Time: It was remaining even then: A Rest, a Sab∣batism; which was not then by him, and those to whom he wrote, fully entred into, possessed, and injoyed: Though Believers, so far as they had their Citi∣zenship, their Burgeship, in Heaven and in the Spirit did converse with the glorious Inhabitants of the New City, of that Heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24. &amp; 4. 3, 9. Philip. 3. 20.</NOTE> did pass into somewhat of it, and had some views and foretasts, some beginnings and first fruits of it.</P>
<P>So that the parallel here, is between Rest and Rest: For as <HI>Jehovab Aelobim</HI> the Creator, having finished his Works of the six foregoing Days in the first Week of the Created World, did Rest on the Seventh-day Sabbath; and look, as the Israclites did Rest in the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> after their labour and travel, when they had peaceable, quiet possession of that Land: So shall believers also, when they have done their <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Acts 13. 22, 36.</NOTE> Generation-work, and have finished the <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Rev. 14. 13.</NOTE> Work of their Day and Time, in doing and in suffering the whole Will of our LORD, have and injoyed a Rest, a Sabbatism, which will be fully compleated in that bet∣ter Heavenly Country.</P>
<P>And so also is the parallel, between entring, or not entring into the typical Rest in the Land of <HI>Canaan:</HI> and entring, or not entring into that Rest which was typified thereby: which was not a First-Day Rest, as is pretended; but the Heavenly, Eternal Rest. This parallel is held forth in the eleventh, eighteenth and nineteenth Verses of the third Chapter, and in the first, third, sixth, tenth and eleventh Verses of the fourth Chapter.</P>
<P>And the parallel further holds, between Believers and Unbelievers, in the passage towards, or entrance, or not entrance into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Land of Typical Rest, according as they were perswadable and obedient, or not: And Believers, or Unbelievers, since the time of that <HI>Psalm</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
(which I therefore mention because it is the Foundation of the Discourse in this place to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and particularly at the time, when the Author of this Epistle did write, wherein all Ages since, and those after us are also concerned:) For, even these also, according as they are found perswadable and obedient, or not, so shall they, either enter into, or come short of, this typified promised Rest. As it was in the Prophet <HI>David's</HI> time; the offer of Grace, as to the Promised Rest was made to the Israelites (for this same Gospel was published unto them under that Ministration of Grace, as unto us now, under the present Dispen∣sation of Grace, in the second and third Verses of the fourth Chapter: The Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in the <HI>Messiah,</HI> being the Doctrine in <HI>David's</HI> time, and in <HI>Moses</HI> Days, and long enough before him:) and those of them, who were believing, obedient, and perswadable; in the sixth, and seventh, and ele∣venth Verses of that <HI>Psalm.</HI> So that there was in part a fulfilling of this in <HI>David's</HI> time, both as to the threatning part upon the unbelieving, impenitent and disobedint, dying away such; and as to the promising part, as to the be∣lieving, repenting, and obeying ones, who died <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 13▪ 16.</NOTE> in the Faith: And therefore, it cannot be understood of the First Day of the Week, in opposition to the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as is pretended: there being nothing at all of any such observation of the First Day in <HI>David's</HI> time: And the same Gospel was published unto those in the time of the Author of this Epistle, in the second Verse, of the fourth Chapter; even as unto the Israelites before: and it had a further fulfilling than in that Authors time, in the third Verse of the fourth Chapter: and it still has and will have, as the Exhortations do prevail; in the first, sixth, seventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth Verses of the third Chapter; and the first, third, eleventh, fourteenth and sixteenth Verses of the fourth Chapter.</P>
<P>The Works that Believers are said to Rest from, in the tenth Verse of the fourth Chapter, are according to Scripture-phrase, and meaning <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Rev. 14. 13.</NOTE> elsewhere, their labours. Believers shall Rest from their labours; from the labours of their particular Functions and Callings, wherein they were exercised in their life time here: and as for their labour in the LORD, whilst they were here, in which time they did abound in the Work of their LORD; as also for their labour of Love in all their suffering, as well as doing for Christ, Believers will have satisfaction and complacency, sweetness and delight, in such works as these are: though above, in the heavenly Rest, they will be wholly for ever free from sufferings; as also from all corrupt mixtures and defectivenesses, which were their sorrow, grief and trouble here, which they much laboured under: where the Tempter shall no more assault them. There is a Rest promised to Believers, evidently and expresly, in the first, third, and eleventh Verses of this fourth Chapter: (not now to mention other Verses in this passage of this Epistle:) which the Objector doth causlesly and groundlesly controvert. And Rest is a cessation from such Labour and Work, as into which that Labour and Rest doth pass; which Rest in the better heavenly Country, is so far from being unsuit∣able to the purpose of the Author of this Epistle, that it is the main drift and scope of his arguing in the third and sourth Chapters, to exhort the Christi∣anized, professing Hebrews to take great heed, lest they were shut out of it; by their unbelief, unperswadableness, and disobedience, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Heb. 4. 1, 3, 5. &amp; 3. 18, 19. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 10, 13, 14, 15, 16.</NOTE> as the unbelieving, un∣perswadable and disobedient of old, amongst the Israelities, did not enter into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which was a Type of this Rest: The parallel of the, <HI>As,</HI> the Believers resting from his Works, as God Christ, God man, rested from his Works, holds here exactly enough in the sense of this Objector himself: For he affirms, that in the tenth Verse of the fourth Chapter of this Epistle; and in his expression upon it, that the Works which Christ did rest from, were all that he did and suffered from his Incarnation to his Resurrection, as the Mediator of the Covenant; with all the Fruits, Effects and Consequents of what he so did and suffered; as belong to these Works. And so shall Believers Rest when they shall pass into Glory, from what they did and suffered for Christ here. As Christ shall suffer no more, and dye no more; so Believers shall suffer no more, dye no more; when once raised as Christ is risen: As Christ so ceased from
<PB N="80" REF="45"/>
Working, as yet to continue the Work of his Grace in the preservation of the New Creature, and orderly increase, and propagation of it by the Spirit, so shall Believers so cease from this working here, as yet to continue in the full supplies of the holy Spirit for ever, in the acting of Grace, perfected in Glory, in the freest, largest exercising, and putting forth thereof, according to the capacities and powers of the New Creature, when thus growing up, to its well propor∣tioned measure of a perfect man: keeping the New Creature by a Power re∣ceived from Christ, in its due order, and putting it forth to the Glory of <HI>Je∣hovah Aelohim.</HI> As Christ so Rested from his Works, as to take Refreshment in his Works, to have satisfaction and complacency in them, as those which did set forth his praise, and did satisfie his glorious design: Thus Believers so far are delighted with what they have done and suffered for Christ, as the Father is delighted and pleased in what his holy Spirit through Christ has in wrought in them, and inabled them to Work for the setting forth of his Praise, and for the promoting of his Glorious Design in the World, whilst they were in it: and so far they were conformed here to Christ in their doing and suffering here for Christ, who will be their Eternal Righteousness, even in Glory, though they own nothing in any, or in all their own Works as Meritorious of Reward, or satisfactory to Divine Justice, these being the Works of Christ, the Mediator by his alone All-suffering Sacrifice. So that here is a fair apt resemblance, as to Works, and as to Rest. They do answer each other, so far as Believers have a capacity in a way of similitude: And this kind of doing, and of suffering, doth last as long as a Believers life doth last, even upon the Seventh-day Sabbath, in their weekly Returns, according to the Duties of those Days (as Christ's do∣ing and suffering, did last as long as his life did last, even upon the Seventh-day Sabbath.) There is a Sabbath-service, which a Believer is to do for Christ, in Obedience to his Command: and men of persecuting spirits, will be laying on of crosses upon the Believer, for his thus keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath holy to <HI>Jehovah;</HI> though a Believer will rejoyce in such sufferings for Christ. Only here the Reader may take notice, that this Objector doth lay the foundation of his Sabbatizing, on the Morning of the First Day of the Week, when he sup∣poseth, that Christ by his then first rising from the dead, did lay and perfect the Foundation of the New Creation: I desire that this may be considered; How can a serious inquiring spirit be satisfied from the Objectors arguing con∣cerning a Weekly-day of Rest, or Sabbath, from Sun-rising to Sun-set of that First Day, by an Argument drawn from Christs ceasing from his Works of Redempti∣on on that Morning, as he affirms; when withal, he doth acknowledge, that Christ works did continue from his Inearnation to his Resurrection, without any interruption, never ceasing from it all the First Days of his Life? Can a weekly half-day of resting from work be demonstratively inforced upon a rati∣onal intellect from three and thirty years continued working without any ces∣sation from that working? (For, that is the shortest time assigned to Christ's abode here on Earth: though some do reckon more years than three and thirty.) The Creation of the World was finished in six Days, which did lay the founda∣tion of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, both in Word and Nature, to continue every Week: As a Law, Rule and Pattern for man's working the six foregoing Days, and for his resting on the Seventh, which is the last Day of the Week: Whereas now, this Objector would urge upon our consciences a weekly observing of half a Day, as a weekly Day of Rest or Sabbath, from a continued Work, thirty years out-right, if not more.</P>

The Believing <HI>Israelites</HI> had their Work and La∣bour, and then their Rest ensued thereupon, when they entred into the Typical Land of Promised Rest, and quietly enjoyed it when they had subdued their E∣nemies: And so shall Believers, after their Working-Labouring-Season is over here, enter into that Promised Rest, of which the other was a Type.

<P>As for the Import of the change of the Number from the Plural to the Singu∣lar, which the Objector would fetch about to his own purpose thus: The A∣postle, saith he, here changeth the manner of his Expression from the Plural ab∣solutely, <HI>We who believe;</HI> or virtually in the name of a Multitude, The people of God; into that which is absolutely singular, <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>He that is entred:</HI> A single person is here expressed; One, on whose Account the things mentioned are as∣serted.

<P>To this I reply that other Reasons may be clearly assigned from the Context for that Change of Phrase, and yet the same kind of persons be expresly meant, with respect unto whom the things mentioned are asserted; as I have already shewn to be the meaning of this place: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 1,</NOTE> and other Scriptures compared, do well agree in the like use of such a Phrase, where the same persons or things spoken of are sometimes expressed in the Plural Number, and sometimes in the Singular. Take some few Instances: That which in the fourth Chapter of this Epistle, and fourth Verse is, And He Rested This God in that Day, that Seventh, (so signifi∣cantly by a double Article is that Seventh-Day-Sabbath pointed out, as I have observed, to be that particular day, the last day of the Week from the Creation, to be the Weekly Sabbath Day: It is not One day in Seven, not a Seventh part of Time; but That Seventh:) From All those Works of Him, or of His. See here; It is Works, in the Plural. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 2.</NOTE> This in another place, to which it doth ma∣nifestly refer, is thus expressed; And He did perfect (or finish) <HI>Aelohim,</HI> (a word also Plural in the Hebrew, whereas God in the Greek is Singular;) in a day. This Seventh His Work (Work in the Singular Number) and He did Sabbatize in a day, That Seventh, from all His Work, (Work again in the Singular Num∣ber, though with a Collective Particle) which He had made. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Compare.</HI> 2 Chron. 6. 28, 34. <HI>with</HI> 1 King. 8. 37. &amp; Mat. 13. 35. <HI>with</HI> Psal. 78. 2. &amp; 2 Chron. 23 9. <HI>with</HI> 2 King. 11. 10. &amp; 2 Chron. 9. 21. <HI>with</HI> 1 King 10. 22. &amp; 1 Chron. 11. 4. <HI>with</HI> 2 Sam. 5. 6. &amp; 1 Sam. 31. 1. 1 Chron. 10. 1. &amp; 2 King. 21. 6. <HI>with</HI> 2 Chron. 23. 1. <HI>See also</HI> Psal. 25. 32.

Where <HI>Thou</HI> is <HI>All,</HI> and every one of such there spoken to; as to one Man, because every man particularly was concerned in what all of them did there. We have more Instances in this Epistle, and that particularly in this passage of it, which doth relate to the matter in hand: What in the eighth Verse of the third Chapter is Hearts in the Plural Number, is in the eighth Verse of the ninety fifth <HI>Psalm,</HI> out of which it is taken, Heart in the Singular Number: So what in the ninth Verse of the third Chapter of this Epistle, is Works, in the Plural Number, is Work, in the Singular Number, in the ninth Verse of that <HI>Psalm.</HI> Elsewhere, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Deut. 7. 10.</NOTE> the Singular Number doth in the same Verse follow pre∣sently upon the Plural Number; <HI>Jehovah</HI> the <HI>Aelohim</HI> of his people, repayeth them that hate him unto his faces, to destroy him: He will not delay to him that hateth him; unto his faces, he will repay him.

<P>As for what this Objector doth say, that the Rest, which this person is said to enter into, is called his Rest absolutely: Whereas, the Rest which Believers are said to enter into, is either called God's Rest, or Rest absolutely, but not their Rest, or our Rest.</P>
<P>If this be admitted, that the Rest here, be the Rest of him who is the Au∣thor of it, the, <HI>He,</HI> who is entring into it, is not meant of the Believer: For the same Rest, which is the Authors Rest, is also the Rest of the Believer, of eve∣ry Believer.

As the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which was the Type of this Rest, was <HI>Jehovah Aelohims,</HI> to promise it, and to give it to his <HI>Israel;</HI> yet withal, it was the Israelites, called therefore <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Gen. 48 21.</NOTE> the Region of the Fathers of the Israelites, and the <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Gen. 40. 15.</NOTE> Land of the Hebrews: The place which <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Abraham</HI> was to receive for an Inheritance: The <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Lament. 5. 2.</NOTE> Inheritance of the Jews.

In the mean while He has given and left His Peace with them, that their hearts might Rest in Him; and when their time is come, they shall <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Rev. 14. 13.</NOTE> Rest from their Labours with Him in Glory. And now let the Reader, with me, make out after this remain∣ing Sabbatism, that this Promised Rest may be ours, that we may not so much as seem to come short of it. Then and there will be a Sabbatizing, a ceasing as from much other Labour and Work, so from these Strifes and Disputations: The per∣fectly sanctified Spirit of Just men will come fully home to its Rest; sitting down in Glory; enjoying Christ, and Rest in Him. O the Blessedness of such! O hap∣py we! and O happy our Progresses, our goings on with a streight foot towards this! if we be such believing, obeying, perswadable ones as shall enter into this Rest!</P>
<P>If the Reader be one who hath met with this Objector's arguing against the Seventh Day Sabbath, it may be he would willingly have somewhat returned in Answer yet further, unto some Grounds, on which that learned Adversary doth lay the pretended change of the Weekly-Sabbath-Day, from the Seventh to the First day: I shall therefore transcribe what is written about this.</P>
<P><HI>God,</HI> saith he, <HI>had of old determined the Renovation of All, by a new Creation, a new Law of that Creation, a new Covenant, and a new Sabbatical Rest, unto His own Glory by Jesus Christ. The Renovation of all things by Jesus Christ is prophesied of, and foretold, as a new Creation of All; even of the Heavens, and of the Earth, and all things contained in them;</HI> Isai. 65. 17, 18. <HI>and</HI> 66. 22. 2 Pet. 3. 13. <HI>Hence the State of things to be introduced thereby, was under the Old Testament called, the World to come;</HI> Heb. 2. 5. <HI>In the Prophety of the New Temple or Church-state in those Days, there is Especial Direction given for the Service of the Sabbath-Day,</HI> Ezek. 46. 4. <HI>This Renovation of all things is said accordingly to be accomplished in Christ; 2 Cor.</HI> 5. 17, 18. Old things are passed away; Behold, all things are be∣come New: <HI>The Old Law, Old Covenant, Old Worship, Old Sabbath; all that was peculiar unto the Covenant of Works, as such, in the first Institution of it and its re∣newed Declaration on Mount</HI> Sinai; <HI>all are gone, and antiquated. The Moral Law, materially the same, is now the Rule of our Obedience; not merely and absolutely unto God, as the Creator, the First Cause and Last End of All; But as unto God in Christ, bringing of us into a New Relation unto Himself, There is now a New Cove∣nant, part of the New Creation:</HI> Jerem. 31. 32. Heb. 8. 9. <HI>No man can assert the same day of Rest, precisely the Seventh-Day, to abide as of old; but he must likewise assert, the same Law, the same Covenant, the same Rest of God, the same way of Entring into it; which yet, as all acknowledge, are changed. On this we lay the

Observation of the LORD's Day under the New Testament, or a new Work of Crea∣tion,</HI> Isai. 65. 17. &amp; 66. 22, 23. 2 Pet 3. 13. Rev. 21. 1. Rom. 8. 19, 20. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Gal. 6. 15. <HI>Or a Work of new Creation is undertaken and compleated. This new Creation is accompanied with a new Law, and a new Covenant or the Law of Faith, and the Covenant of Grace,</HI> Rom. 3. 27. &amp; 8. 2, 3. 4. Jer. 31. 32, 33, 34. Heb. 8. 8-13. <HI>Ʋnto this Law and Covenant, a day of Holy Rest unto the LORD, doth belong, which cannot be the same day with the former, no more than it is the same Law, or the same Covenant which were Originally given unto us,</HI> Heb. 4. 9. Rev. 1. 10. <HI>This Day was limited and determined to the first day of the Week, by our LORD Jesus Christ.</HI> Thus this Objector.</P>
<P>In my reply to this, after two premises, I am to shew that this new Heaven, and this new Earth spoken of in Prophetical Scripture; This Renovation by a new Creation; is not so finished and compleated, but that it is yet to come, in the largest fulfilling and accomplishing of it. That, there was a Covenant of Grace under the Old Testament Administration; that, the new Worship was Typically signified in the figuring pattern of old: That the Law of Faith was a Law under the Old Testament dispensation: That, the old Law of the ten words, is still the same: It was the rule of obedience to them under the Old Testament, as unto God in Christ, and is still so a rule unto us under the New: And then let me be discharged from this Scholastick War.</P>
<P>Let this be one premise (which is several times in short expressions, here and there in this Treatise:) That, it is a choice priviledge and a special liberty, which Believers do enjoy under the New Testament Administration of Grace: <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> Christ profiteth them nothing by his coming in the Flesh, (born of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> to accomplish and to perfect the Types of old, which did so set out his thus coming) who keep themselves still under the former dispensation of Types, Shadows, and Figures: We thankfully acknowledge to the Honour of our LORD that gracious administration especially now towards the latter-day glory of it, that we are brought under, which if compared with the former, under the Old Testament, as to the different manner of dispensing; (For other∣wise, we are to discover in it's place, that, the Christian Religion is one and the same for Doctrines, Duties, Gifts, Graces, Priviledges, under both) has excelling advantages; such as these for the measures, and for the degrees of them; It has more <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. 3, 6. John 10. 10. E∣zck. 47. 9.</NOTE> lively efficaciousness, more quick sensible Fellowship: <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. 15, 16, 18. Dan. 12. 4. Isa. 119. Hab. 2. 14. Jer. 31. 34. Isa. 54 13. John 6. 45. Heb. 8. 11.</NOTE> It has more clear convincing Light, and more abounding spreading knowledge: And blessed be <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who is in this providential day, clearing up and reviving some too long neglected Truths and Duties! amongst some others, this about the weekly Seventh day Sabbath. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 3. 2.

John 4. 23, 24.</NOTE> It has a more spi∣ritual way of Worship: It has a more <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11; 18. Isa. 60, 1, 2, 21.

Mark 12. 34. 1 Pet. 2. 9. John 3. 3, 5. Mat. 18. 1, 3, 4. &amp; 5. 19, 20. &amp; 11. 11, 12. &amp; 13. 11, 24, 31, 33, 44, 45, 47, 52. &amp; 20. 1. &amp; 22. 2. &amp; 25. 1. Heb. 8. 5. &amp; 9. 23.</NOTE> It has more Royal privileges, set out therefore by a Kingdom of God, and of Heaven: And the things of it are called Heavenly things. This is meant of a Church State here on Earth: For, above, in the Heavenly glory, there are no unfruitful ones, no Tares, no Scandals, no Doers of Iniquity, no bad Fish, no foolish ones? This New Testa∣ment Church State has the name of a Kingdom of Heaven, as it doth much resemble that glorious Kingdom which is above in Heaven, in its way of Go∣vernment: In its order of subjection, in its sights of Faith, in its enjoyments of Communion, in its service of Delight, and in its conformity of Holiness: Here these are in growingness of measure; There they are in fulness of Perfection. This new Church State has much brought down from Heaven to it; Such, as are gracious visits from <HI>Jehovah-Aelohim,</HI> in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, An∣gelical Ministry, like-affectionedness of the perfectly sanctified spirits of just Men, and Heavenly Messengers with the Everlasting Gospel. This new Church State is drawn up to be much in the Spirit in Heaven above, by joynt unions; By mutual Fellowships: and it doth believe and expect a new Heaven, and a new Earth, and a new City, where they shall be all (the Saints and Believers

both of Old and New Testament:) together with one another, and with the elect Angels, and with their LORD to hidden Age, ever as yet. Thus it grows up into a Spiritual Kingdom. How large and delightful a Field is here for Hea∣venly Meditation! The manner of administring is not now, by obscure Types, and by darkish shadows, as of old, but without a veil, and open faced: yet Christ is the substance of both the Old and the New Testament; the same pro∣mises and rewards of Life everlasting were in this Christ, and purchased by him: and there was one way and the same mean of receiving of this under both: which was Faith in the <HI>Messiah:</HI> The difference that is between the Old and the New doth discover it self in the Form of dispensation; which had a diversity for the manner of it, in the Old from the New: But this made no real specifick difference or change in the essentials of the Christian Religion. Under the Old, Believers had an eye towards a <HI>Messiah,</HI> who was then to come in the Flesh to be born of a Virgin; and so they eyed the Pattern, and Propheties, and Promises, looking for the coming Christ: What were all the Figures and Types, the Rites, and Shadows, but confirmers of their Faith in, and encouragers of their hope of, Christ's coming? In the New, we have it revealed, that Christ is now actually already come, to accomplish those Types, and to perfect Salvation by his personal Sacrifice. The Reader may therefore be well satisfied in this, that, our pleading of the cause of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as it hath no tendency in it self, so no design in me; To cast any back, or to hold any under the Old Testa∣ment Administration, as to the Types, Shadows, and Figures, of it; much less to draw off, or to thrust back any from coming into, and enjoying of New Testament priviledges.</P>
<P>I shall not say that it was the Objectors intended aim, but it is evidently con∣sequential from his manner of discourse; that, his Lines about this, would se∣cretly insinuate into the Reader of them, as if the Assertors and Observers of the weekly Seventh day Sabbath did Apostatize into Judaic ceremonies: I have here another opportunity to wipe off a slanderous charge which some have brought in against us; as if we stood guilty according to those two Scriptures in the <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Gal. 4. 9, 10. Col. 2. 8, 18, 17.</NOTE> Margin, of catching at the shadow, and letting go the body. Let it be granted, that the Elements, Rudiments, or first beginnings, mentioned in that place of the Epistle to the <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Gal. 4. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Galatians,</HI> are the Mosaical Rites, ceremonial Laws, and shadows of a Christ, who under that dispensation was then to come, to be born of a Virgin; but is now already come, so born: This then doth shew, that, the Apostle condemneth their superstitions observing, or their keeping be∣sides Right and Equity, (as that <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> word which they tranflate, <HI>ye observe,</HI> doth signifie when taken in an ill sense:) Especially when it was with an opinion of acceptance and justification in the sight of God thereby, such, either un-Scriptu∣ral days, as were never instituted by <HI>Jehovah.</HI> Christ; or Scriptural days in an un-Scriptural manner. This were a foul matter of sinful Fact, sharply to be re∣prehended: As when either the right object, a God in Christ, is not worship∣ped; or when for the matter of observing, it is not New Testament Worship: Or when for the Form of observing of Times and of Worship, there was not an orderly address unto <HI>Jehovah Aelohim:</HI> To the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit, in a word way; not in a spiritual manner; not from inward prin∣ciples of new Nature, of Faith, of Love, and of Obedience: or when the ends of observing of Days and Times were not right ends: when the Gospel de∣signs of humbling, emptying, and abasing of Man, and of exalting and glori∣fying of a God in Christ, were not promoted thereby: when there was a carnal compliance either with old Judaizers, or with superstitious Pagans, who had ad∣ded divers of their own Ethnick corrupt mixtures of Idolatrous Worship, which they gave to Sun, Moon, and Stars; By the course and motion whereof, Days, Times, Moons, and Years were measured. Gentile Philosophers having par∣celled out the power of the only true God, into the particular vertues of Ele∣ments and Creatures; As the Lights in the Heavens, Fire, Water, and Earth; ascribing some portion of Deity to every one of these: and so assigning a part of the Worship of God, unto them, too: appointing times and seasons for their superstitious service. These practices are blame worthy. This were to go
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>
back either to the Old Testament dispensation, or to return to their former Heathenish Rites, which is three times rebuked and reproved, What? Again? Again? Backward? But what is all this to the standing Law of the Seventh day Sabbath, kept in an Holy Spiritual manner, in obedience to <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s command, according to his Word Institution? This is a matter of a distinct Nature from the other; being a Law of another kind. So, that to lay aside all instituted natural seasons of Worship, such as daily Evening and Morning Worship, and weekly Sabbath Worship, as some would infer from this place, is in the issue to open a back-door for the main of Religion, to be turned out at; and to enforce it as others do from hence and from <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Rom. 14. 5, 6.</NOTE> one Scripture more, which they also wrest to the like wrong ill purpose, as if it mattered not what day of the Week were kept; or whether any day, or no day at all: So both were done to the LORD: and we were now under no such particular Law. This were to open a Gap to all superstition and prophaneness: or to urge it, as if we were now under no obligation of one special day in a Week: but must keep every day of the week as Sabbath, as some others. Which is quite contrary to the whole Scripture, and to the Word and Nature of a Sabbath-day: Which is a cessation from the or∣dinary labour, a resting from the common work, of our particular Functions (which to do on every day of the Week, were a sin, expresly against the Letter of the Law of the fourth word, which doth command us to work six days:) To spend the day in the Instituted work of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim;</HI> This, under a pretence of being always in a Sabbath, is to mislead them, to be never in a Sabbath: Or, as other some, to plead from hence, that, they may keep both first day, and Se∣venth-day too, as Sabbaths every week, this also is directly against the precept; For, we must work the six foregoing days of the Week, and rest on the Seventh. We do declare against all and every of these mistakes and miscarriages both in principle and in practice: in whomsoever they are found. <HI>Paul</HI> is supposed by these Objectors, to speak against the observing of that which comes under the expression of weak and poor Rudiments, Elements, or first beginnings: Where∣as the ten Words are not such. These are <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">James 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> a Kingly Law, Obedience to these, is the Liberty of Children, whereas subjection to the other in comparison of this was sometimes <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gal. 4. 3. Rom. 8. 15.</NOTE> the Bondage of Servants. The ten Words are a Kingly Law of Liberty. If it be objected, that, the Typical, Figuring, shadowy part annexed of old to the Seventh-day Sabbath, to be then observed, such as the two He-Lambs, and such like, was a part of these weak and poor Rudiments; We ac∣knowledge that these have received their perfection and accomplishment in Christ now come, born of a Virgin. So that, in this <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">See the Margi∣nal Note on <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 16. in the En∣glish Bible.</NOTE> part, which was Typi∣cally superadded, we are not now so to observe the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath; by such Types and Figures: but after that glorious, spiritual, Heavenly manner as becometh those who are under this New Testament dispensation: and thus to keep it, is no bondage to a renewed Heart: The more excelling in Knowledge, in Grace, and in Experience, that any is, the more free will they be to this; when once they are led aright into it. Let that therefore which <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Gal. 4. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> saith in the twelfth verse, be considered here: <HI>Be ye as I am, for I have been as ye are:</HI> As if he had said, I was once superstitious, whilst a Pharisee, fond of un-Scriptural Traditionary seasons, days, and observances, or an observer of Scriptural times and institutions in an un-Scriptural un-Spiritual manner as ye; but now I bring all to a Word-Rule, and so should you. If the Reader do diligently ob∣serve it, in his going over of this Epistle, he may find, the Law of the ten words established, as a rule of Life, in the whole of it, and by enumeration and inducti∣on in several particular commands of it: though withal he set out the different manner of dispensing of Grace under the Old and New Testament. This im∣proved and applyed might also be an answer to that part of the Objection, which is formed from wresting that other place to the <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Col. 2. 8, 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Colossians.</HI> The great drift, scope, and design, of the Apostle in this second Chapter, is <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">See Verses, 1. 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 19.</NOTE> to set up and esta∣blish Jesus Christ as Head, LORD, Law-giver, and the great Exemplar. Con∣trary unto which amongst others were these great opposers, the maintainers and defenders of corrupt Philosophy, whereby <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">ver. 8. 18.</NOTE> some did endeavour to make a prey of Souls, through affectation of humane Wisdom, and vain deception according

to the Tradition of Men, according to the Elements of the World, and not ac∣cording to Christ. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">ver. 20. 21, 22, 23.</NOTE> Another sort of Adversaries, were the Advocates for hu∣mane Inventions, the pleaders for the institutions and impositions of Men besides and against the Scriptures of Truth in the matters of Faith and of manners, of Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, Government and Conversation, they were Will-worshippers: Some others there were who were hot contenders for the keeping up of such Ceremonies, as were once Shadows and Types of a Christ, who was then to come to be born in the flesh of a Virgin. These Typical Institutions were perfected in Christ, when he thus came: These shadows now passed into the body and substance of them. Believers were now complete in their Head Christ, in the tenth Verse; and had the true grace of what was under Types and Shadows before, in the eleventh and twelfth verses. That Chirograph by Rites which before they had as it were written, exhibited, signed, sealed and de∣livered, was now blotted out or cancelled; Which before was their act and deed: in the fourteenth and fifteenth Verses. As for what they object, that two He-Lambs of the first year perfect, were an annexed part of the worship on the Seventh day Sabbath; and two tenth parts of fine flower for a Meat∣offering, mingled with Oyl, and the Drink offering thereof; the Burnt-offering of the Sabbath in his Sabbath: As if therefore the Sabbath too were to be laid aside with these: If there were any force in this arguing, then we should lay aside all Religion and Worship: For, what was there under that former dis∣pensation, which some way or other had not some Figures and shadows annexed to it? There was blood of a Bull sprinkled on the Altar, Christ: and the Book of the Covenant it self: and what? shall we therefore lay aside Christ and his Book? The particular commands of the ten words had some Types and Fi∣gures annexed to them: Doctrines, Duties, Graces, and Priviledges, relating to the first and second words, were set out by the Ark, the Altars, the Burnt offe∣rings, the Incense, the Fire on the Altar, and such like: as any spiritual discerner may discover, by comparing the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> with the pattern in the Mount. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Numb. 5, 22, 25 26. Lev. 6. 3, 6. Numb. 6. 1-21.</NOTE> The third word or command, in several duties of it, had annexed Ceremonials, as particularly about an Oath, about a Vow. Thus also about the sixth word or command; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Deut. 21. 1-9.</NOTE> as in a case of Murther: about the seventh com∣mand: <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Numb. 5. 11. 31</NOTE> as in a case of Jealousie: about the eight word or command, as in a case of <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Lev. 6. 1-7.</NOTE> Restitution: and generally when a Soul did sin in omitting of some du∣ty, or in committing of a Trespass, when it was ignorantly, or in some other ca∣ses, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Lev. 4. 5. ch. 6.</NOTE> there were peculiar offerings that were appointed. So that, if this carnal reasoning did hold, it would lay aside all and every of the other ten words. This Epistle to the <HI>Colossians</HI> doth establish the Law of the ten words in the seve∣ral particulars of it; <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Col. 2. 18.</NOTE> and the first word, by forbidding the worshipping of Angels: <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">ver. 20-23.</NOTE> the second, by condemning of Will-worship.

<P>The next premise is, that the LORD Jesus Christ was Administrator under the Old, as well as New Testament dispensation of Grace. I take it to be one great occasion of many misapprehensions, not only in the common sort of professing Christians, but even in many who have gotten a name for Learning and for God∣liness; that they eye Christ as Christ and Redeemer only under the New Testa∣ment, and God as Creator only, under the Old: Whereas Christ <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Prov. 8. 23. 2. 2. 6. &amp; 45. 8. 1 Sam. 2. 10. 25. 2 Chron. 6. 42.

that he was anointed from the beginning before the Earth was as yet made; and the Father speaks of this his Son, under the Old Testament, that he had a∣nointed him; <HI>Aelohim</HI> anointed him by pouring out of the Oyl of his Spirit upon him, with an effusion of a fulness of Gifts, and of Graces, and of Joys, mention∣ing it expresly as a matter of Fact done, <HI>Mashiach,</HI> or Christ, or Anointed, is one of the Mediators names; often used in the Old Testament: This is attributed to his substance: The Father had ordained him to his Mediatoral Office of Priest, King and Prophet even then. It was Christ, who was tempted by the unbe∣lieving Israelites of old: It was by Christ, that all things were created: Christ was the same under all Dispensations of Grace: The Fathers purpose and electi∣on concerning his people was in Christ: The whole Word, is the Word of Christ: Believers were reproached for Christ, in <HI>Moses's</HI> time: It was the Spirit of Christ, who was in the Prophets; and the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans</HI> acknowledged the <HI>Messias,</HI> before they knew who was the very person, and this Christ acted as Mediator under the Old, as well as under the New Testament: Though his being born of a Virgin, and so taking the Humane Nature to his Godhead, were a great part of the New Testament Dispensation; when in the days of his flesh here on earth he familiarly conversed with men: For he had a way of appearing as Man to several Believers upon several occasions under the Old Te∣stament, as a forerunning discovery of this latter. It was the <HI>Messiah</HI> or Christ, who made himself known, by open manifestation visibly, audibly, to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to <HI>Isaac,</HI> to <HI>Jacob,</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> and to several of the Prophets, and to some others. It was he who proclaimed the Law of the ten Words at Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> and who afterwards upon the same Mount, gave the typical pattern for that Dispensation privately to <HI>Moses;</HI> It was he who was with the Israelitish Church in the Wilder∣ness; he was the Mediator between God and Man, even then; he was the Re∣conciler, even in those Ages. This and more to this purpose, I have already proved from the Scripture in this Book; and therefore if the Reader would be further informed and inlightned in it, I refer him to the Pages cited in the <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Pag 67. 10 pag. 93.</NOTE> Margin. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Acts 10. 43.</NOTE> This is he, to whom all, (observe all; It was the received and deli∣vered Doctrine of them all) the Prophets do give Witness, that through the Name of the LORD Jesus Christ, whosoever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins. A great, full word, this: But a remark and observand, a special one upon it. It is acknowledged by this learned Man, that it was the Son, who from the Foundation of the World, immediately in his own person transacted the Affairs of God with Men; yet he opposeth the Seventh day Sabbath; whereas, it was a Law of Christ's giving to Mankind from the be∣ginning.</P>
<P>Come we now unto the proofs of the several particulars forementioned; whereof this is one, that this New Heaven, and this New Earth, spoken of in prophetical Scripture, this Renovation by a New Creation, is not finished and completed, but that it is yet to come in the large fufilling and accomplishing of it. There will be. New Heavens, and a New Earth: This we believe; because the Scriptures have foretold it: and we rejoyce in Hope of their Appearing: For they are not as yet come. These glorious Creatures are antedated by such Objectors, by many hundreds of years. For, although there were some begin∣nings of a New Creation in the Days of Christ's Flesh here on Earth, and after Christ's Ascension, in the Apostle's time; in Regenerations and Conversions, as there were also in the Old; For, even there we may read of the <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Psal. 51. 10.</NOTE> creating of a clean Heart, and of the renewing of a right constant Spirit: Christ's name was <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Psal. 72. 17. &amp; 105. 15.</NOTE> filiated even under that Dispensation, and there were Sons and Daughters new createdly born unto him, even then; and Believers were instated in the <HI>Mes∣siah</HI> then. As for that place in the <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 17.</NOTE> second Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians, If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; Old things pass away, beheld all things be∣come new;</HI> It doth speak a wonderful change in the New Creature: The old carnal State; the old corrupt Principles; the old crooked Rules; the old selfish ends; the old bad Frames; the old uutoward Actings; the erroneous mi∣stakes; the formality in Worship; the old unscriptural Traditions; the old Sins; the old man's Conversion; and such like: These do pass away: and all things,
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>
contrary to these, are become new: A whole new man. The Apostle speaks of what is peculiar to the New Creature in Christ, as such: For, as for the old ceremonious Rites, and their passing away, even those that were not new Crea∣tures, but were carnal Professors of Christianity, yet had these things passing away, and they were put under a new Administation: the new dispensation of Grace had Ordinances now in a more spiritual heavenly way and manner. The passing away of old things here, is of old things so far as they stand in opposition to the new Creature; and <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</NOTE> unto that new life in and to Christ, which now the converted person should live: That, as Christ so loved his people, as to dye and rise again for them, so should those in Christ thus evidence their Love to Christ, by living no longer to themselves, but unto him; crucifying the old man; mor∣tifying the sins and lusts of that old man, and vivifying or quickning the new man: which was true in the Types and Figures before Christ was come, born of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> and which is still true, now after that Christ is come and ascended up into Glory. But all this doth make nothing, as to the passing away of the Law of the ten Words; in all of them, or in <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE> any one the least of them. This is a distinct fort of Laws, from the Typical, Figuring, Shadowy, Instituti∣ons. The Law of the ten Words, as it always has been, so is it now, and still will be, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 6. 15, 16. &amp; 5. 6. compared with 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7 19.</NOTE> the Rule of the new Creature in Christ Jesus: For, what in one place, is called the new Creatures Rule, in another, speaking to the same case, is the keeping of the Commandments of God. In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision; but a new Creature: And as many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be on them and Mercy, and on the <HI>Israel</HI> of God. The <HI>Israel</HI> of old had no saving benefit barely by the outward sign of Circumcision: whereas God's <HI>Israel</HI> then, who had the sign and the thing sig∣nified too, they had the Mercy and Peace, who were new Creatures, united to the <HI>Messiah</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 11. throughout. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 29, 30, 31.</NOTE> by Faith working by Love: who had their hearts circumcised to love <HI>Jehovah</HI> their God, who had sin subdued and lust mortified: And the un∣circumcision under the new Dispensation was not of any good avail without the new Birth, without conjunction to, and communion with it: and if the Re∣generate, the new Born, the new Created would evidence and approve them∣selves to be such; and to be in Christ, they must obey him and keep his Command∣ments: But what is all this to any change of the weekly Sabbath, from the Se∣venth to the First Day of the Week? To pass from one sort of Laws into ano∣ther sort of Laws, from the Law of figuring Types, to the Law of the ten Words; and to infer the passing away of any one of the Laws of the ten Words, from the passing of Types into the Antitypes, and of signifying Figures into their signified things; is a transition from one kind to another; a way of sophistical arguing, of fallacious disputing, captiously to over-reach the ignorant too credu∣dulous vulgar, and to defraud them of their right to the Truth.</P>
<P>As for that part of the Objection, which doth speak of new Heavens, and of new Earth, pretended to be completed and finished on the Day of Christ's Resurrection, from whence to conclude the passing away of the Seventh-day Sabbath, to make room for a First-Day-weekly Sabbath, it is so scriptureless, so natureless, so reasonless, an inference, that it should have been more preconsidered by this Arguer, whether it do conclude and prove any thing but this, that the Adversaries would fain have something or other that might carry a little colour, and some shew with it, if they know what; For, let it be pondered, upon search and examination, that all those places of Scripture, which do speak of the new Heavens, and the new Earth, do relate to a further time for their full accom∣plishment than precisely to the Day of Christ's Resurrection.</P>
<P>That Prophesie in <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Isai. 43. 19. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Isaiah,</HI> hath an eye to the more large and spreading conversions of the two, and ten Tribes, in the latter days yet to come. How was this then fulfilled on Christ's Resurrection-Day? who of them was then converted? what eminent new Creatorship was there then brought forth, which might put any such signal remark upon the First Day of the Week, as from thence to become the new weekly Sabbath? When the most of the Disciples themselves did scarce believe him to be raised, till after that Day was over: And two Disciples, with whom he had walked some Miles that Day, had little
<PB N="90" REF="50"/>
belief of his Resurrection; and little knowledge of him, till he disappeared from them? How few in comparison, were brought in unto Christ, and made new Creatures, in all Christ's life time, at his Death and Resurrection, and forty Days after that, till after his Ascension, and after the pourings out of the Holy Spirit? That forementioned Prophesie doth foretel, that Nations shall be brought under the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Isai. 43. 3, 4.</NOTE> Jews Dominions, when those new Heavens, and new Earth shall appear. This was not at the time of Christ's Resurrection-day; nor ever since: and they were then, and have been since, for sixteen hundred years or more, so far Ruling over the Nations, that they have been a scattered, despised broken people, without so much as any <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Hos. 3. 4, 5.</NOTE> Political Kingly Government amongst them∣selves: It foretels, that those of <HI>Judah,</HI> and of <HI>Israel</HI> should be gathered out of all Quarters, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Isai. 43. 5, 6.</NOTE> East, West, North and South: This also is behind yet unfulfilled: That <HI>Euphrates</HI> would be dry: Was this on Christ's Resurrection Day?

<P>Another Prophesie by <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Isai. 65. 17,</NOTE> <HI>Isaiah,</HI> doth fortel, that at that time of the new Hea∣vens, and the new Earth, the ten Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> as well as the other two, of <HI>Judah,</HI> and of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> shall according as to an express promise, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Isai. 65. 10.</NOTE> return home to their own Country and Land: For <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 5. 16.

When these things shall come to pass, the LORD will make crooked things to be streightness before his people; when that Law of his, to which the Isles do expect shall be magnified, and made honoura∣ble, as the Giver of it, also will be. So great and so glorious things being to come, so long after <HI>Isaiah's</HI> Prophesyings: Such as whereof all the World could not have foretold; these are confirmed and verified by the Testimony of the Fa∣ther, in his Son, by his Spirit in his Word. As for what is Prophesied of by <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 46. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Ezekiel</HI> concerning the new Temple, or Church state, where especial direction is given for the service of the Sabbath-day; this doth confirm and establish the Seventh-day Sabbath to continue under New Testament times.

These things,</HI> saith he, <HI>shall perish;</HI> They had not then perished: <HI>The day of the LORD shall come,</HI> It was not then come; but they were to look for, and to hasten unto the coming of it: <HI>We, according to his promise, expect new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness:</HI> We look for these things, They were as yet but in the Promise: They were under the Expectation of Believers: They looked for them, but they did not then see and enjoy them actually, in their real Coming; for they were not as yet come. Thus also that Prophety by <HI>John,</HI> in the <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Rev. 21. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>Revelation;</HI> when he had a Visional sight of a new Heaven and a new Earth, upon the passing away of the first Heaven and the first Earth; and when he saw the Holy City, and the New <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and when a great Voice out of Heaven had told him, that God would wipe off all tears from the eyes of his Co∣venant-people; and that Death should be no more, neither mourning nor crying, nor any more trouble; for the former things should pass away. <HI>He that sat up∣on the Throne said, Behold, I make all things new: Write, for these things are true and faithful.</HI> Is it not evident here, that this Prophetie was many years after the Day of Christ's Resurrection? And must not the Fulfilling be after the Prophe∣tie? Is there not enough in this very place to confute the Objector's Arguing; Is the first Heaven and the first Earth yet passed away? When ever was this fulfil∣led? Is the new Heaven and the new Earth yet come? Is the Holy City, the New <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as yet come down from God <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Rev. 21. 2, 10. &amp; 3. 10.</NOTE> out of Heaven? Are there not tears found in the eyes of the LORD'S people, to be wiped away? Is there not death still? Are these former things yet passed away?

<P>That other Scripture in the Epistle to the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 8.-13.</NOTE> <HI>Hebrews,</HI> has the same Import and Design, as to the Covenant, and the renewing of it. Here is no determi∣nate Day of Christ's Resurrection mentioned; when this Promise was to have its exact precise fulfilling: and if we would point any particular time more than other, according to this kind of arguing, it was rather the Fruit of Christ's <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 1, 4.</NOTE> Ascension, if it relate to those times so near Christ, when this High Priest entred into the Holy of Holies: For this Chapter doth more particularly set out the High Priesthood of Christ, entred into Heaven with Blood, and with Incense, satisfying and interceding there; fitting at the Right hand of his Fa∣ther; Raigning; having all Power; sending Messengers to teach his People; and so is more consummately a glorious Priest, King and Prophet together; a∣ctually bestowing upon Believers all those purchased, covenanted Blessings, for which he intercedes on their behalf; as Pardon, Peace, Grace, Mercy, Reconci∣liation, Assistance, Acceptance, and such like: which he did for Believers be∣fore, but in another way of dispensing: For, whilst he remained on Earth, e∣ven after his Resurrection, till he ascended into Heaven, the Levitical Priest∣hood did continue. So that, the Honour is more in some respect put upon Christ's Ascension, if we will date these new things about that time, when Christ went up into the highest Heavens: For, then more especially, was the <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> new and living Way new made, by Christ's entring into the Holy of Holies, into the highest Heaven. As to what doth relate to the New Testament Mini∣stration, as such more spiritually dispensed, we have several times acknowledged, that without making any change in the sum and substance of the Christian Reli∣gion, in the Law of the ten Words. The Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> doth set out the excellency of the New Testament, above and beyond the Old, as to the clearness and gloriousness of dispensing the same Truths and Things of God, which were of old under a darker administration. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 15, 16, 17, 18. <HI>(compare</HI> 2 Cor. 2. 3, 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> This new Cove∣nant spoken of, has had in all Ages, since the writing of that Epistle, some par∣ticular fulfillings, when the Regenerating Spirit doth write the Holy Law of the ten Words, on the two Tables of the Mind and Heart of any person and people, especially if they be of the converted Hebrews, who are more eminently con∣cerned in this Promise, the most of which is yet behind unaccomplished, and waits for the larger conversions of that people, in days yet to come: For that is a prophetical Scripture, yet taken out of that place in <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> which has

been spoken unto already, and which is again mentioned <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Rev. 212, 7.</NOTE> towards the closing up of the New Testament Canon, as reserved for one of the choicest Blessings of the last days.

O how good is it to be here / But I must come down to this Mount, and do further work yet, for my LORD and Master.</P>
<P>I am now to evidence from the Scriptures of Truth, that there was a Cove∣nant of Grace under the Old Testament Administration. This Doctrine of Grace is that, which must lay the foundation for an after assertion of mine about a Law of faith, under the Old Testament; For <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.</NOTE> Grace and Faith are com∣panions: Rich Grace, abounding Mercy, free Love, from the Father, in and through his Son Christ, revealed to and in his people, doth by his Spirit in his Word, Inwork the Grace of Faith in them, and calls forth acts of Faith from them; that Christ may be made to them, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctificati∣on and Redemption; that no flesh might glory in his Presence; but that those who glory, mighty glory in the LORD: and saving justifying Faith doth bot∣tom upon the Power and Truth of God; manifesting his unchangeable free Grace to Believers; giving them this Grace of Faith, whereby they apply Christ and his Righteousness unto themselves, for their justification in the fight of God, making them to acknowledge, that <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2, 8, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> they are justified, accepted and saved, not of Works, neither of themselves, but by Grace, through and for Christ.</P>
<P>In Order to the Augmentation of this Holy Science, I would propound these Questions to further Disquisition.</P>
<P>Q. Whether, where ever in the Old Testament, he that appeared as a Man, or as an Angel, and withal is called <HI>Jehovah,</HI> be not always Christ, manifesting him∣self under that Dispensation of Grace?</P>
<P>Q. Whether, if all the Hebrew Words, which in the Old Testament do set out Grace, Mercy, Sweet Savour, Acceptance, free Favour, Covenanting, Atone∣ment, Reconciliation, Propitiation, Pardon and such like; withal Synonyms
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>
and Phrases relating thercunto. If all these were put together, it would not bring great Light to this Doctrine of a Covenant of Grace?</P>
<P>Q. Whether there be clear Scripture-Evidences, that ever there were any Cove∣nant made between God and Man, of Salvation by Works only, without Free Grace in a Mediator, on God's part; and without Faith in a <HI>Messiah</HI> on Man's part? So that Man's Justification and Eternal Life was solely and merely upon this one only condition of mans perfect, perpetual, absolute, personal obedi∣ence to the whole Law of God, to all and every of his Commands.</P>
<P>Before I pass more thorowly into the Proof of a Covenant of Grace under the old Dispensation, it may be of some use to open that expression of a New, or a Renewed Covenant, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Jer. 31. 31, 32. Heb. 8. 9.</NOTE> in the Prophesie of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and in the Epistle to the Hebrews. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Chadash. 1 Sam. 11. 14. Psal 51. 10. Iam 5. 21. 2 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brou 15. 8. Psal. 03 5. Job 10. 17. Psal. 104. 30. Isal. 61. 4. Lev. 23. 16.</NOTE> The Hebrew word for New is several times rendred Renewed by the English Translators themselves; as the Reader may see in the Scriptures cited in the Margin: the Hebrew often signifying, not New for the Kind, but another of the same thing for Kind: The same word, which is in <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> A Covenant Renewed; as New Days, and New Mercies, are Renewed Days, and Renewed Mercies <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">John 13. 24. 1 John 2. 7, 8. 2 John 5.</NOTE> Thus a new Commandment of Love, is a Renewed Commandment of the good old duty of Love, <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Thus also in the Greek Language, in that forementi∣oned Instance; it was an old Command renewed and revived: So it is also in the <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, To renew; in the composition with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to re∣now. 2 Cor. 4. 16. Col. 3. 10. Rom. 12. 2. Tit 3. 6.</NOTE> Verb. Hence the Renewing of our Mind, and the Renewnig of the Holy Spi∣rit. That it has this sense in the eighth Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, will yet more clearly appear; when I shall discover, that all and every of the par∣ticulars expressed in that Covenant, are such as have been, as were in their na∣ture, real Existence, and actual Being, under the Old Testament dispensation.</P>
<P>In this, as in other great Undertakings in this Treatise, my Calls are more vo∣cal than others from the LORD; to commit my soul by well doing, unto this Faithful Creator, and loving Redeemer, <HI>Jehovah</HI> Christ. Considering the much opposition I have met with heretofore, about this and other such Enquiries; and may yet further be exercised with. But he who made all things is also the Head of the Body; of his Body the Church; that in all he might hold the Chief. For so it pleased the Father; who in, and through, and by his Son, has in all Ages of the world, manifested and dispensed much of the freeness of this Love, and of the Riches of his Grace; which that <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 16. Heb. 6. 13-. 18.</NOTE> it might be made firm unto his people, he hath put into a Promise, made sure with his Oath.</P>
<P>That Covenant which <HI>Aelobim</HI> in Christ made with his people, was a Cove∣nant of Grace; one and the same both in the Old and New Testament, differing only in the manner of dispensing: As also is the whole of the Christian Religion <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> one and the same in both, for Doctrines and Duties, for Graces and Privileges, and such like parts of this Religion, which doth vary only in the several ways of Administration.</P>
<P>By a Covenant of Grace, I mean the LORD'S free promising of Life, of Wisdome, of Righteousness, of Sanctification, of Redemption, of all good things to his people, believing in Christ; who are thus specally favoured by him. The Instances which I shall particularize in, will be those after <HI>Adam's</HI> Fall. Such a Gracious Covenant the LORD made with his people, who were under the Old Testament-dispensation. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 15.</NOTE> How much of Grace was there put into that one comprehensive Promise, <HI>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's head.</HI></P>
<P>I shall gather a little out of that full store of this which is to be found, and put it together. <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Gen. 6. 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Noah</HI> was one that found grace in the eyes of <HI>Jehovah;</HI> a just man, perfect in his Generations; he walked with <HI>Aelohim.</HI> It is one of <HI>Jehovah's</HI> Names, that he is gracious: And it is the special privilege of his people, that he has a peculiar favour for them. <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 4, 5. &amp; 11. 5, 6.</NOTE> This Grace doth <HI>Paul,</HI> in what he wrote to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> oppose unto Works, and unto Debt: <HI>It was the free mer∣oy of God, in Christ;</HI> Noah <HI>did not deserve it. And it was</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>by faith that</HI> Noah <HI>pleased God, and served him with acceptance. With this</HI> Noah <HI>did</HI> Aelohim <HI>esta∣blish his Covenant, that</HI> Noah <HI>should enter into the Ark; he, and his Sons, and his
<PB N="95" REF="52"/>
Wife, and his Sons wives with him; where they should be saved from the common drawning:</HI> Noah <HI>in faith, and in abedience, prepares the Ark to the saving of his houshold; through the which be condemned the World, and was heir of the righteous∣ness which is by faith;</HI> as is mentioned in the Epistle to the Hebrews. <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. &amp; 1 Pet. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> calleth him, <HI>A Preacher of Righteousness.</HI> That this was typical, and had some further spiritual meaning in it, the same <HI>Peter</HI> doth declare, by shewing, that Ba∣ptism under the New Testament was an Anti-type to this, an answerable Figure, saving of Believers by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. This Doctrine of the Free Covenant of Mercy, of Righteousness, and of Salvatiou by Faith in Christ, did <HI>Noah</HI> commend to his hearers; and it was sealed up towards the Faithful, in that wonderful deliverance in the Ark, which did shadow forth Salvation through Faith in Christ, and that Believers, of the Posterity of <HI>Noah,</HI> should be Heirs by Faith of the righteousness of Christ; which was in this Type made a special Free Covenant with them; whilst the unbelieving and unperswadable, the impeni∣tent and disobedient, living and dying such, would perish and be destroyed. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gen. 8. 20, 21. Heb. 13. 10.</NOTE> After the Flood, <HI>Noah</HI> thus saved, builds an Altar to <HI>Jehovah,</HI> which was a Fi∣gure of Christ; by whom we are to offer the Sacrifice of Praise, always unto God; as is interpreted in the Epistle to the Hebrews: <HI>It is Christ, the spiritual Altar, who doth sanctifie the offering, and the gift.</HI> On this Altar which <HI>Noah</HI> did build, <HI>Noah</HI> offered up burnt Offerings of every clean Beast, and of every clean Fowl. The LORD Christ was hereby Typified, who performed his Office of Mediation, as in all the other parts of it, so in the discharge of his Priestly Function, offering up of himself a propitiatory Sacrifice to God his Father more especially, for those whom the Father gave unto him: This he did by the everlasting Spirit without spot: This was signified hereby, expiation, and the doing away of sin, by the slain Sacrifices of Christ himself: <HI>Jehovah</HI> smelled a smell of rest, in what <HI>Noah</HI> did; graciously accepting of the Sacrifice thus of∣fered: and again makes a Covenant with <HI>Noah,</HI> of rich Mercy in Christ: by and through whom Believers should be freed from the Curse. For another confir∣mation of this gracious Promise, the LORD makes it sure unto Believers by a sign. He gives them a <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen. 9. S.-17l</NOTE> visible Token at some Seasons, for the encourage∣ment of his peoples Faith, that when they saw him giving his Bow in the Cloud, they might believe, that he would remember his Covenant, that they might rest on him, and on his faithfulness, in the true performance of the Word of his Grace. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Isai. 34. 9, 10.</NOTE> This Covenant made with <HI>Noah,</HI> that there should not be any more a Flood, to destroy the Earth, doth the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> apply to the Covenant of Grace, made with Believers in Christ, confirmed by Oath. For, as he swore, that the Waters of <HI>Noah</HI> should no more go over the Earth, so he hath sworn, that he will be no more angry with his Covenant-people, nor rebuke them; And the Rainbow, which is a visible sign of his special Favour, is both in <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Visi∣on, and in the Visions of <HI>John,</HI> in the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rev. 4. 3. &amp; 10. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Revelation,</HI> used as a sign of Grace from God to his people in Christ: It was a gracious Testimony of Christ's glo∣rious Majesty.</P>

This free gracious Covenant and Promise, doth <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistles, to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> affirm, improve, and apply. It was sealed by Circumcision to <HI>Abraham:</HI> and that which was sealed was the Righteousness of Faith; and his Faith was therein confirmed by <HI>Jehovah's</HI> Oath, as the Scriptures in divers places have recorded: It was full of Mercy and Fa∣vour, and <HI>Jehovah</HI> forgets it not: but, as he hath remembred, so he doth and will remember for his people, this his holy Covenant. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 16, 17.</NOTE> The Covenant of the Law proclaimed afterwards at Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> could not disanul this Covenant with <HI>Abraham;</HI> which was confirmed afore of God in respect of Christ: as <HI>Paul</HI> argues with many convincing Arguments: especially two, if this be well con∣sidered,

<P>And, if further, this may also be demonstrated concerning the Law of the ten Words, which was proclaimed with more open Solemnity, and glorious Majesty, that this also has in it the same Covenant of Grace, the Kingly Law will then the more commend it self to the hearts of all the Disciples of Christ.</P>
<P>This Law has in the Scriptures, the Name and the Thing of a Covenant of Grace. It is called a Covenant, such an one as has Gràce in it; For, if we con∣sider it, as having the supperadded Law of Types and of Figures, annexed to it; So <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Exod. 24. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> this Covenant was not dedicated without Blood. The patterns of heavenly things were purified by the Blood of Sacrifices, whereby Christ was held forth as confirming the Promises to Believers by his own Blood. The Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> makes mention of <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Hagg. 2. 5.</NOTE> this Covenant, made with them in Christ. And <HI>Paul</HI> in declaring the Priviledges and Advantages of that People, doth reckon up these, that they were the adopted people of God, the <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 4.</NOTE> Ark of the Covenant, in which the ten Words was put, were amongst them, was their Glo∣ry; all full of Grace; there were the Covenants; the two Tables of them; the Law-giving, and the Instituted-worship, was theirs; and so were the Promises too, which went along together with those other favours. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2. 12.</NOTE> So that, to be e∣stranged from the Citizenship of <HI>Israel,</HI> was to be strangers to the Covenants of Promise. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Exod 34. 28.</NOTE> The Words there spoken are called, The Words of the Covenant: The two Tables on which the Words were written by the Finger of <HI>Aelohim</HI> himself, have the name of the <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Exod. 34. 28.

It was this Christ who was Administrator and Dispenser at Mount <HI>Sinai:</HI> He was the Proclaimer of his own Kingly Law there, as hath been already proved by the Scriptures. It was he, whom the Father gave <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Isai. 42. 1-6.</NOTE> for a Covenant of the people. He who is <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 19, 20.</NOTE> the Mediator of the Covenant: He who was the <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Mal. 3. 1.</NOTE> Angel of the Covenant: <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 1. 20.

This Law it self had much of a Gospel Design in it; In the preparation that was made for the giving and receiving of it; there were precious Promises made to that people, who were then about to be taken into Covenant with <HI>Jehovah Aelohim:</HI> A God in Christ ingaged that, if hearkning they would hearken to his Voice, and keep his Covenant, <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Exod. 19 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2. 9.

<P>So <HI>Paul</HI> kept close to this Expression; and that of <HI>Peter</HI> is much the same, in his first Epistle; though expressed by another; <HI>A people for peculiar possession;</HI> these are they whom Christ Buys and Redeems to himself, for his own special use and service, they are singularly dear unto him.

The Election was of his Grace, not of any worthiness in them. This Jewel was dear unto him, and he promised a further honour that he would put upon them; <HI>They should be unto him a Kingdom of Priests, and an holy Nation.</HI> Is not this the self-same thing which is mentioned, as the Covenant-privilege of God's chosen ones under the New Testament-dispensation of Grace?

How full are the treasures of this Grace! O, what an honour did <HI>Jehovah</HI> put upon that People, whom he so brought unto himself! How sig∣nal a favour was this to his <HI>Israel!</HI></P>
<P>If we look into the Ten words themselves, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 1, 2, 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Deut. 5. 6, 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> do they not begin with a gracious Covenant? <HI>I</HI> Jehovah, <HI>Thy God.</HI> This he made over to his People in a special manner, there being no higher, no greater Good than himself; none so high, none so great as he: He is all Good in one; whatever Good there is, it is in and from him.

<P>As <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 2, 5, 7, 10, 12.</NOTE> this doth bring in the first great Word or Command, so also is it expresly put into the Second, into the Third, and into the Fourth; into every Word of Command of the First Table: In the Second Table also, we may find it in the Fifth Word. And those that will diligently observe, and duly apply it in their reading of the Holy Scriptures, may discern it to be a rich Portion, going along with every one of the Ten Words in particular, as well as made over to all of them in general; especially with respect to the Fourth Word. It is remarkable in <HI>Moses</HI>'s repeating of this Law, that in his going over of the Law for the Seventh-Day-Sabbath, this Covenant of Grace, <HI>I am</HI> Jehovah, <HI>Thy God,</HI> is <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Deut. 5. 12, —5.</NOTE> four times expresly mentioned: besides the Type of Spiritual Redemption by Christ; which is also about thirty nine years after Christ's first proclaiming of this Law at Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> superadded, and expresly put into this Fourth Word, as a forcible Reason to engage Obedience to this holy Precept: The Figure of which Salvation by Christ, and of his delivering of his people from their Spiritual bondage and mise∣ry under Sin and <HI>Satan,</HI> is a choice part of the Covenant of Grace. This is that which doth lead in the Ten Words: By this manifested Grace doth he invite his people to Faith and Obedience.

<P>If you meditate upon what did accompany the ten Words, and what was an∣nexed to them, what were all the Shadows and Figures, and Types, but a signi∣ficant Commentary upon the Covenant of Grace? What was the true spiritual meaning of all these superadded Patterns, but to set out Christ, and all those spe∣cial benefits, which Believers have and do injoy in him, of which the followers of Christ, under that Dispensation of Grace, had a free participation; as the Disciples of Christ have now? <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10 1-4. Act. 15. 11. &amp; 10. 43. Rom. 10. 4.</NOTE> they fed on Christ, in their Manna from Hea∣ven; and they drank of Christ in their Water from the Rock. By the Grace of the LORD Jesus Christ, they did believe to be saved the same way, as Be∣lievers do now: <HI>Peter</HI> put no difference between them and us, but only in the manner of dispensing. What shall I say more, of all the Signs and Seals, <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">The Sacrifices, the Oblations, and much more, that might be spoken of.</NOTE> under that Administration, of the free favour of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> towards his Covenant people? What was all this, but a Gospel-Teaching, an applying of the Covenant? Take but off the Veil from them, and they appear much with a face of shining Grace. Was not the Virtue and Efficacy of Christ's death un∣der that dispensation of Grace? He was the Lamb sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in from the Foundation of the World; so he is said to be, in the <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Rev. 13. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Revelation.</HI> Christ's satisfaction and intercession was available for his Covenant people in <HI>Moses</HI>'s time.

This Covenant or Testament at <HI>Horeb,</HI> as the Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> hath observed and declared, was not dedicate without blood. These were Patterns, Anti-types (and the Types must answer the one to the other:) of the heavenly things, and they were purified by the blood of those Sacrifices, signifying, that the LORD Christ, by his death should sanctifie his people unto himself, by the blood of the New Testament; in a clearer manner of dispensing, and fuller measure of ac∣complishing, though otherways, one and the same Covenant of Grace. <HI>Moses</HI> called upon the people to behold this, which Scripture is explained in what is written to the <HI>Hebrews;</HI> this is the Blood of the Covenant, or of the Testa∣ment, which God hath commanded unto you. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 11-18.</NOTE> Thus was the Covenant of Grace under the Old Testament confirmed by the Blood of Beasts, exactly an∣swering unto the same Covenant of Grace, under the New Testament; which was confirmed by the Blood of Christ. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Acts 10. 43.</NOTE> There was free remission of sins: ac∣ceptation of the person, and of the service, for in the through Christ, then as there is now. All the Prophets do give witness unto Christ; that, through his Name, whosoever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins. This doth further appear in <HI>Moses</HI>'s repeating over in the latter part of his Book, the same Covenant which <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> made with his people at <HI>Sinai;</HI> wherein he doth at large discover, how much rich Grace, and free Love, a God in Christ had manifested towards that people in Covenant with him: The Book common∣ly called <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> is a second Declaration of the same Covenant of Grace, repeated, renewed with their Children; renewed with <HI>Israel;</HI> the same made before; only with some clearer Revelation of Christ, and of Blessings by him, and of inlarged, explained promises. It was the same Covenant of Grace, which was also solemnly renewed with, and by the people of God, at their re∣turn from the Captivity of <HI>Babylon,</HI> as may be seen in the Records of <HI>Ezra,</HI> and of <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> The same Covenant of Grace, also which the LORD makes with his people in Christ now.

the new formed created people in the latter days. Who shall not so break Co∣venant as those Israelites in the Wilderness of old did, but shall be more sted∣fast and faithful to God, who will be so graciously in Covenant with them. Those promises in <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> repeated in the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> are if not peculiarly, yet at least chiefly, made to the house of <HI>Israel;</HI> the ten Tribes, as well as <HI>Judah,</HI> have their part in them, <HI>Ephraim</HI> setting out the Israelites of the ten Tribes: They shall come from the North, and be generally called, an innu∣merable multitude; they shall dwell in their Cities in their own Country; their City of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> shall be re-edified; their Estate shall be flourishing and happy to perpetual continuance; with such other things, as were never yet throughly fulfilled.

<P>This will yet further, be evidently demonstrated, in that, this Prophetie and Promise was renewed and revived several years after Christs Ascension into Heaven, as is clear by the mention of it in that Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and in several places of the <HI>Revelation.</HI> For the contrary to all this was some few years in the same generation or age after Christ's death; the Jew's were unchurched; the City and the Temple were destroyed, according to Christ's foretelling, in what is written in that <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Mat. 24. 1-2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> Book of his Generation.</P>
<P>All and every of the particulars expressed in the renewed Covenant, were be∣fore, under that Dispensation in <HI>Moses</HI>'s time: They are also now made good unto this present Dispensation, according to the manner and measure of Ad∣ministration, as the All-wise God saw and sees fit, which will be more clearly manifested, and more fully accomplished in the last times.

<P>So that all these Promises in the Covenant of Grace, have been, are and will be the same under both the Dispensations. All the difference is, that in the last days, there will be a more clear discovery of this gracious Covenant: A more glorious way of dispensing; a more through inabling to the keeping of it.

There are Universal Principles of this Law of the ten Words, which do pertain to Faith and Manners; and these Practical Dictates which every one of these Laws doth include is a Fundamental Truth and Doctrine necessary to be believed; as, that we must have <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> for our God, and him a∣lone: that we must worship him according to his Institutions in his Word, and not in any other way of Humane Inventing, and imposing, that we ought to have an holy reverent use of his Name: That the Seventh day is his Sabbath, in which we may not do the servile works of our particular calling; that the Father and Mother are to be honoured; and so of the rest.

For, hereby it was evident, that there is another life after this is end∣ed, which those departed Saints, that were dead as to this life, had their shares and parts in. So that, God not only was heretofore, but still now is, and will be their God, after their death. The Bodies of <HI>Abraham,</HI> of <HI>Isaac,</HI> and of <HI>Ja∣cob</HI> shall rise, and therefore the bodies of the dead shall rise, they shall live again, whereas now they are dead; and therefore they shall arise.

<P>Having thus at large manifested it to be according to the Word, that there was a Covenant of Grace under the Old Testament-administration; and that the pri∣vileges of the LORD's Covenant-people, even then, were the same for kind, with Believers now, though differently dispensed. I shall here further discover, that the Seventh-Day-Sabbath it self was some ways a sign of this; thus impro∣ving this Expression and Meditation to a right useful purpose, which some Ad∣versaries do wrongfully pervert to an ill end. Thus they object:</P>
<P>The Seventh Day-Sabbath was a sign of their Sanctification, to whom it was given; and <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Exod. 31. 13, 17. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k. 20. 12.</NOTE> therefore of a Ceremonial nature, and not given to all men. These to whom the Sabbath was given, to them it was a sign of their present Sanctifica∣tion; but it was no sign of the present Sanctification of all people over the whole World: And therefore, it was never given to all the people of the whole World, but only unto God's people <HI>Israel:</HI> And therefore of no Natural Consideration, therefore Ceremonial. Thus it is objected,</P>
<P>This Objection is like to have the more satisfactory Answer, if there be a due clear distinguishing of the several things which are contained in it; and a proper Application of each Particular, unto the present matter in hand; that so the un∣derstanding Reader and the spiritual Discerner may see that way plain before him, which may directly lead him into the Mind and Will of Christ, and he may the better learn the Truth as it is in Jesus. I purpose therefore to distinguish of Signs, of Sanctification, of the Law of the Ten Words, of Peoples, of Ceremonials, of Giving this Law of the Ten Words.</P>
<P>Signs are either natural Signs, such as have a force of signifying from the crea∣ted Nature of that thing which is the Sign.

There is the same word in the Original. A diligent Observer with the eye, of the motions of those Luminaries, may see that set Times and fit Seasons for so∣lemn Assembling, and for Instituted Worship are directed to, and pointed at by these shining Lights to measure out Daily-Evening and Morning, and Weekly-Seventh-Day-Sabbath Opportunities, for our direction in Working and in Rest∣ing; or the conserving of the orderly course and state of this World, in the re∣quired matters of appointed Services, due from Man, to his Creators and Makers throughout all the Ages, all the days of this Earth: Which is also put into a <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Gen. 8. 72.

If these be Signs of created Nature, of the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath, after the six foregoing working Days, in the same Week; and this Seventh day-Sabbath have foundation in created Nature; and both these be by the Ordi∣nation and appointment by the All wise Creator; then (this being so established by an unchangeable Law of pure Primitive Creation;) the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 14. &amp; 2. 1, 2, 3.

Which Seventh-day-Sabbath is also a sign of <HI>Aelohim</HI>'s creating the World, of Heaven and of Earth, and of all things therein, in the six foreging Days; and of his Resting on the Seventh, which is the last Day of the Week. This being expresly rendred by himself as the Reason, why it is called a Sign.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="58"/>
Or Signs are instituted: which do signifie somewhat by Vertue of some spe∣cial appointment, by the only Supreme Soveraign LORD and Lawgiver, <HI>Jeho∣vah</HI> Christ. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Numb. 28. 9, 10. Heb. 9. 24. &amp; 10. 1.</NOTE> Thus the Typical Sacrifices, and such Ceremonial Figures, as were after wards annexed for a time, to the weekly Seventh day-Sabbath, were Signs and Shadows, Types and Figures. These were significative of a Christ, who was then under that Dispensation to come, to be born of a Virgin: So they were perfected and accomplished in and by Christ; when God was thus mani∣fested in the Flesh; when Christ was then born of the Virgin <HI>Mary:</HI> But the weekly Seventh day-Sabbath had its created Being before this; and distinct from this, and so continued after this did pass into its Antitype.

<P>If the Objector, or any other do further affirm, that the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath, is still a significant Sign by Institution; and that this significative∣ness is a part of it.

For the Type must continue till the Antitype come. Let these men therefore keep the Seventh-day-Sabbath till they get to Heaven; if ever they come there: and then and there they will know more clearly and fully. If a∣ny further Typical significativeness be pretended and urged, when I understand what it is, it is like to pass under Examination and Consideration with me. Observe here, that <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 19.</NOTE> the Typical Signs superadded unto the Law of the ten Words, did establish that Law in the natural unchangeable Holiness and Righte∣ousness of it: Only by Institution they did put some further thing into it, du∣ring that former Dispensation of Grace.</P>

And in the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ezek. 20. 12, 20.</NOTE> other place, the latter Verse doth take in the past Time: which they render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uturely: In the former Verse it is Infinitive and Indefinite. Thus the Seventh-day-Sabbath is a Sign between <HI>Jehovah</HI> and his Covenant-people, that they are a separate sanctified people; a special token of his distinguishing kindness unto such as are inwardly in Covenant with him: and some ways a Priviledge, even to those who are as yet but outwardly in Covenant with him; as it brings them under the Instituted Ordinances of that Day. The Seventh-day-Sabbath in a Documental Sign, giving Institution in this Pledge of Christ's Love, who having been the Creator, is the Redeemer too, and will be sanctificati∣on to his Covenant-people, who are in a special manner his new created, peculiar∣ly redeemed, and separatedly sanctified Ones. As this Seventh-day-Sabbath has its Nature, Institution, Use and End, put into Scripture-Revelation, so it is a peculiar Sign to those, unto whom this Word-discovery is made; especially, when to their inner man; and will be such to the Worlds end, to all and every of those who are so choicely favoured. It is a witnessing evi∣dencing Sign to know this, where Spiritual-Worshippers are Right Sabbath-keepers.</P>
<P>Were there a more Universal-holy-through growing-Conformity, in Know∣ledge and in Obedience, to this and to every other just, holy, and good Law of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> experience would prove to spiritual senses, what Faith is to
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>
believe from Word-Revelation, that the Weekly Seventh day-Sabbath would be such a Sign as would (the holy Spirit of the LORD, witnessing together with a renewed Spirit in the Saints;) point out unto them, and declare in them, that such are some of <HI>Jehovah's</HI> peculiar people in special Covenant with them, (like as <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 John 3. 14. Gal. 5. 22, 23.</NOTE> the holy Fruits of the regenerating Spirit, are such a notifying-testify∣ing, certifying Sign of translation from death to life; This is a Sign which doth still continue. O who will give, that there were more of this evidencing Sign, (as to the natural Seed of such of <HI>Israel</HI> of old, as were spiritualized and new born; so to the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Psal. 24. 3▪6.</NOTE> Spiritual Seed of <HI>Israel</HI> now:) that there is a mutual convenant∣ing and communion between <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> and such a people of his, that they might know him to be theirs, and themselves to be his! This is a Sign that is still put into a Promise; and will even now, and in after days be made good to right Spiritual Observers of <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath! A Sign to know (here is one great End and special Use of this Sign, which is also a lasting-standing continued one) that <HI>Jehovah</HI> doth sanctifie such, and is their God. Whoever he be that can well evidence an Universal Obedience and Con∣formity to an whole Christ, and his whole Word, particularly as to his due sanctifying of the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath of <HI>Jehovah</HI> his God (which would much influence and operate upon all other Religion:) would have <HI>Aelo∣him</HI>'s Covenanted-Love more manifested to him, by the incouraging Sign; it would be a token to him for this, and for much other good. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Psal. 92. <HI>through∣out.</HI> Isal. 56. 1-8. Mar. 2 27.</NOTE> It is promised, and it would be injoyed, actually injoyed for the present, even now; and this Spiritual Rest with Christ in God here, would by improving of Mystical-mem∣bership, in relation to the Glorified Ones above, be some beginning of that eternal Sabbatism in Heaven. Thus a Natural Duty is sometimes made a Sign of a Spiri∣tual Priviledge.</P>
<P>Against this, it hath been further objected, that Circumcision is called <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Gen. 17. 7, 11, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2, 13.</NOTE> a Sign of the Covenant between <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> and his Covenant people, in their Generations; for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto them. And so is, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Exod. 31. 13,</NOTE> the Seventh-day-Sabbath, called a Sign between <HI>Jehovah</HI> and his people, throughout their Generations, which they were to observe throughout their ge∣nerations, for an everlasting Covenant between him and the Sons of <HI>Israel;</HI> it a Sign for ever. And therefore they were to cease together.</P>
<P>For Answer to this in the General: Here is a Fallacy of Composition and Division; by taking some things severally and apart, which are to be taken con∣joynedly: and by taking other things conjoynedly, which are to be taken apart. Some things here, would be well divided and severed, which are ill joyned; and other things would be well joyned, which are ill divided. Here the divided sense must be separated from the compounded; and the compound∣ed sense from the divided. There is another Fallacy in the comparing of these two, Circumcision, and the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath. Because it is not of the same thing in the same manner, according to the same part, to the same person and thing, in the same time. And there is a translation from one kind to another. Though in some thing these two, do more generally agree; yet in other things they do specially differ: which doth discover both a deceit and a defect, a confusedness and a captiousness in the Objector. This will further open it self by a more particular distinct considering of what doth follow. All Signs are not mutable or changeable Signs, to end with the Old Testament Dis∣pensation. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 14. &amp; 8. 22. Mat. 24. 29, 30. Jer. 31. 35, 36. &amp; 33. 20-20. Psal 72. 5, 17. &amp; 89 36, 37. Gen. 9. 13.</NOTE> Sun, Moon and Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ have been, are, and will be, to the end of this World, natural and instituted Signs. These Luminaries are Witnesses of God's faithfulness in his Covenant, to Generation of Generations. Thus also are Day and Night such a Sign. The Rain-bow, whenever it doth appear, is to be a Sign to the Worlds end; a Sign or Token of God's Covenant with man∣kind; that he will no more drown this whole Earth with Water. <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath, has been already manifested, to be both a Natural, Instituted, and notifying Sign. Such an immutable unchangeable Sign, as that, <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> will in no Generation, not even under this New Testament Administration put an end to his sanctifying of his people. Whereas Circumcision was a Typical, Mutable, Changeable Sign; <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3. Col. 2. 11, 12. Rom. 28, 29. &amp; 11. 12.</NOTE> which passed into it more spiritual

and heavenly Antitype, when the Old Testament Dispensation was brought to its accomplish perfected End. All Signs are not laid aside under the new Dispensation. The Signs mentioned before, even the Luminaries Day and Night, the Rain bow: So also the Seventh-day Sabbath were Signs under the Old, and do still continue to be Signs under the New Testament admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ration. Such a Sign Circumcision is not, as to that of the Foreskin of the Flesh; for this doth cease. So that Cir∣cumcision was another kind of Law, than the Natural Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath. The Type and Figure of fleshy Circumcision was Temporary and Changeable. This Sign which was the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, did belong to other sorts of Laws; to the Ceremonial Law, as it was Typical, Fi∣guring and Shadowing; and so doth widely differ in the whole kind from the Natural Law of the ten Words (whereof this of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath is one.) Which is <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Psal 19. 7, 8, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Psal. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>throughout.</HI> Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19. Rom. 3. 31. Luk. 16. 17, 29, 31. Jam. 2. 8-12. Exod. 31. 17, 18. &amp; 34. 1, 27, 28.

They were written once and a second time in Tables of Stone, by <HI>Jehovah</HI> Christ, which doth shew amongst somewhat else, their renewed dura∣bleness. It was the Writing of <HI>Aelohim;</HI> and the Record of them is to remain for ever. So that, a due difference must be put, between this weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as it is such a standing established Rule of Life, in created Nature, one of the ten Words; and between some Typical Institutions, and superadded Rites, and Figuring Shadows, afterwards annexed to this Sabbath. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Deut. 13. 14.</NOTE> There is a plain evident difference between these two sorts of Laws. Let <HI>Moses</HI> be heard concerning this in what he said to the Israelites; <HI>Jehovah</HI> declared unto you his Covenant, which he commanded you to do, the ten Words (observe these are distinctly expressed, and severed from the Figuring Laws) and he wrote them upon two Tables of Stone; and <HI>Jehovah</HI> commanded me at that time, to teach you Statutes and Iudgements, that ye may do them in the Land whither ye are going over to possess it. May we not discern here that <HI>Moses</HI> doth put a clear difference between the Laws of the ten Words, which were publickly, openly spoken and given by the LORD Christ in his own Royal Person from his Fa∣ther to all the people, and were written with the Finger of his own Spirit, be∣tween these, and those other shadowy Ordinances, which were privately spoken to <HI>Moses,</HI> only and by him, and by his Ministery brought to the people and written by him? These figuring Statutes admitted of a change, and yet the Law of the Seventh day Sabbath doth remain unchangeable; a perpetual Law. And if any think, that there is yet further any thing significative annexed to this day by <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Institution, of Christ's second coming, and of the heavenly Sab∣batism, then let that so far, when any will clear it up from Scripture, stand firm and unmoved till that time. If the naturalness and self evidence of the Law of the ten Words were to receive a change, because of superadded Institutions, fitted to that Dispensation; particularly as to Signs; then the naturalness and self evidene of every one of them, by this kind of arguing, were to receive a change. Was there not a Law for Fringes, by the Institution of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> himself, throughout the Generations of the Israelites; for this end <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Numb. 15. 37-41.</NOTE> that they might see and remember all his Commandments? This outward Rite was a memorative Sign, or a religious Sign, to help their memories, and to further their sanctification. To lead them unto a continual remembrance and practice of all the Law of the ten Words. Thus also their <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Exod. 13. 9, 16. Deut. 6. 8. &amp; 11. 18. Mat. 23. 5.</NOTE> Phylacteries were for a Sign upon their Hand, and for a Memorial between their eyes, that <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Law might be in their Mouth. This was a Typical Memorial, or Monument. Which is the proper meaning of the Original Word. By this outward Sign <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> would have them to apply all their serious study, and all their careful practice, unto the keeping of all and every of the Laws of the ten Words. All the outward Rites of the <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Psal. 74. 9. Heb. 10. 1. &amp; 9. 10. 13, 14.</NOTE> Ceremonial Laws were Signs, typical Figures, and significant Shadows, instituted of God, as Seals and Pledges to assure Believers of Christ, and of those good things which his Faithful, Obedient, Perswadable ones, have in and by him. A due difference therefore should be put between Signs and Figures, Signs and Shadows: For although in the general, and in common, there be somewhat of a Sign in Figures and Shadows, yet every Sign is not a Figure and Shadow, but has somewhat particularly specially distinct: A
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>
Figure doth set out and foreshew some Truth, Duty, Grace or Priviledge, which is afterwards more clearly to be revealed, though even then to be known, believed, done, acted and injoyed: A Shadow doth give some dark resem∣blance, and it is a betokener of a Body which is to come in the place thereof, and is in the appointed season to be exhibited: whereas a Sign, as it doth in some instances point out somewhat, which is yet afterward to be looked for; so in other cases it doth assure Believers of somewhat that is already gone and per∣formed: and in somewhat else it may stand and be joyned together with that which is signified thereby, and be of special usefulness at one and the same present time. The Ark wherein was nothing but only the ten Words in two Tables; and the propitiatory Covering which was over the Ark were Types, Figures and Shadows of Christ: So that if Ceremonial Annexes should make void the Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, that way of arguing would lay aside and make void all the other Laws of these ten Words. Sanctification, is either that which was natural, and concreated at the first, and is now restored to and in∣wrought in some, a spiritual transforming-Sanctification, whereby <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 23. 2 Thess. 2. 13.

The Seventh-day Sabbath duely observed, and well filled up (having a suitable growing knowledge of, and obedience to, the rest of the revealed Will of God, summarily comprehended in the ten Words) would be a notifying∣testifying-certifying Sign of this Sanctification: as has been shewn.</P>
<P><NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Numb. 6. 11. 2 Chron. 29. 5, 17, 19. Acts 21. 24, 26. Heb. 9. 13.</NOTE> Or it is a Ritual, Ceremonial Sanctification; whereby (under the former Dispensation:) in the use of some outward Rites and Ceremonies, some persons and things, which had some ways contracted some uncleanness, were sanctified or purified, which were typical and significative of in ward spiritual transforming Sanctification, and of real, inwrought Holiness and Purity: Of this sort of Signs were their Blood sprinklings, their Water-washings, and such like. (Baptism <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Rom. 6. 3-6. Tit. 3. 5. John 3. 6.</NOTE> is such a Sign under the new Dispensation.) Thus the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, if it be taken under this consideration, as it had under the Old Testament Administration, divers Ceremonial Laws added unto it, both for preparation before, and for cleansing in and after, in some cases; in this respect, that which was superadded to it, was a Sign of Sanctification to the Israelitish Church, beyond any other people, unless others came in and embraced the same true Religion; and then there was one Law for the Israelite, and for the Stranger: <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. 45, 47, 48, 49. Deut. 4. 7, 8.</NOTE> When the Forreigner or Sojourner did leave the Worship of Idols, and other heathenish practices, of the Infidel World. Thus, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 19. 10, 14. compared with the 20 <HI>Chapter.</HI></NOTE> that people were injoyned some out ward ceremonial Sanctifyings, for the reviving of the Law of the ten Words.

<P>Or Sanctification, is the separating of somewhat from a common use, and destinating and setting of it apart, for some special, singular, holy Use. <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Exod. 29. 44. Lev. 21. 15, 23. &amp; 22. 9, 16. Gal. 1. 15. Jer. 1. 5. Luk. 1. 15. Exod. 31. 13.

So that, in this sense, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Act. 14. 15-18. &amp; 17. 2, 3, 22-34.

Although this Typical Figuring part made no real change even of old upon the Law of the ten Words. If this be considered, as it is, an absolute and perfect Rule of Life, comprehending all duties whatsoever; and being that Image and Samplar, unto which all mankind, at the beginning, in their representative Head, were created in Wisdom, in Holiness, and in Righteousness, which was afterwards promulgated and proclaimed by <HI>Jehovah</HI> Christ, with a Covenant of Grace in∣termingled; so it is that Law of Nature, which inlightned Intellect or right Reason doth teach; some notions whereof are still retained, even now in man's fallen corrupted estate. There are some Seeds of those Eternal Truths, and Things; some common principles of good and of evil; both for the knowledge of God, and of his Service, and for those Duties, which we owe unto our selves, and unto our Neighbours. This is born and bred with reasonable man: every one doth carry it about with him; every one coming into this World, is inlightned therewithal: which Remnants of this Law, do serve for many good uses and purposes in civil converse amongst men, and for some other ends. In this sense the Law of the ten Words, particularly that of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, is given to the whole World. All mankind had it, in their common representative, the first <HI>Adam,</HI> clearly, fully, perfectly; and have still some Re∣licks of it left within them, by the Law of Nature, in the Light of Reason, demonstrated by concreated Principles; the foundations and grounds of which, are knowable by Humane Intellect. In this sense the Law of the ten Words; particularly that of the weekly Seventh day Sabbath, is given to the whole World; all mankind had it in their common representative, and have still some indwelling Notions of it left within them. This Law, in some parts of the natural Duties of it, may yet by the Institution of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> be a sign of some mystical thing signified; which doth make any real change in the natural Duty it self, this standing still in its due force, as before; but it may have some∣thing further significant in it by the LORD's special appointment.

The remaining Relicks of their Natural Life and Right Reason, dictating the equity of this Law; which also might be traditioned down to them: The Pagan Idolaters, so far conforming to the Laws and Practice of the Church of God. They acknowledged the Seventh-day as more holy, and owned its Rest from labour: And the Ethnick Doctors in this way of teaching, would Philo∣sophize only on the Seventh-day Sabbath. Then did they frequent their Tem∣ples: and then some of them sung their Hymns to their Idol God. These Pre∣cepts of the Decalogue, were the Law of our Creation; they are the natural Dictates of the Humane Essence, in its rational Exercise, ingraft Notions, con∣created Characters, wrought into the essential composition of our natural Being; the Sanction whereof has more or less a living impression in the Humane Ex∣istence.

Next of Ceremonials. These are sometimes called <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 2. 15. Hebr. 7. 16. &amp; 9. 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>The Law of Degrees,</HI> placed in external Rites, and by some such other Expressions: These Rites were used about outward fleshie things; such as Meats, Drinks, Washings, and the like. These, so far as they were Typical, Figuring, and Representative, of a Christ who was then to come, to be born of a Virgin, and to shed his blood; were perfected and accomplished in Christ, when he was so born, and had so suffered, was risen and had ascended. And they did peculiarly belong to the People under the former dispensation. Of this nature were some Ceremonies, annexed to the Weekly-seventh-day Sabbath. By these holy rites, the Church and People of God under that administration, were <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Esther. 3. 8. Ephes. 2. 12.</NOTE> differenced and discerned, as a People holy to God, distinct from other prophane Nations. An Old Te∣stament Ceremonie is set out in Scripture by Flesh, a carnal Ordinance, an hand-writing of death, an Element of the World, weak and egene, an Ex∣emplar of Heavenly things, unstable; An Intolerable Yoak. A shadow; and such like; Which are not properly applicable to the Seventh-day-Sabbath, as such: If any say, it is an Exemplar of the Sabbatism in Heaven, and so a Ce∣remonious Type: Let then the Type stand, as I have said, till we can come at the Antitype. Ceremonies sometimes, do set out <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gal 3, 23. 24. 25. Colos 2 14. Hebr. 10. 1. &amp; 9, 24.</NOTE> the inward spiritual things, Gra∣ces, Duties, Priviledges, which they did signify and teach. A Ceremonie has been, and is, a Sign of somewhat that is natural; and so they have been annex∣ed to natural Spiritual Duties. As <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Numb. 28. 1-8.</NOTE> Evening and Morning worshipping of God, had divers Ceremonial Observances. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Numb. 28. 9, 10.</NOTE> So the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath.

Those things which are still of a concreated Spiritual Nature, <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 5, Hebr. 7, 8, 9, 10, Chapters.</NOTE> Were, are, and will be a duty. The Epistle to the Hebrews is a Gospel-Exposition hereupon. Though Multitudes of these Ceremonies were superadded to the Law of the ten Words, as an Evangelical Explanation and Interpretation of them, yet this doth not alter the true real na∣ture of any of these ten words, which are always a standing unalterable Rule of holy Righteous living.</P>
<P>As for the giving of this Law of the Ten words: If this Law be considered <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 1, 1, Deuter. 4. 45. &amp; 5. 5. 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Jerem. 7. 22, 23. &amp; 11. 4.</NOTE> As promulgated and proclaimed at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> by <HI>Jehovah Aelohim;</HI> thus there was somewhat in it which was a peculiar gift to the Israelitish Church, and those who were proselyted to it, beyond any other People.

And thus too, for the solemn im∣bodying of an whole nation into a Church-state. These and some such other like, were the peculiar Circumstances of that Promulgation in that day. Yet is the Law still the same now; The LORD Jesus Christ doth speak unto us, even now, in this Law of the ten Words. What God did speak unto <HI>Moses,</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Compare</HI> Mar. 12. 26. <HI>with</HI> Mat. 22. 31.</NOTE> He spake unto others in the days of Christs flesh, when born of the Virgin Mary: which was hundreds of Years after.

If this Law be considered as the Law of nature, so it was given to all <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>c</HI> Exod. 19. 3, 4. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Deuter 7. 6, 7, 8,</NOTE> mankind, in Representative <HI>Adam:</HI> As I have declared. If it be looked on as Inwritten in the mind and Heart of the Regenerate by the Holy Spirit; Thus it is peculiarly given to new Creatures. As also I have manifested.</P>
<P>Thus I have laboured to clear and to distinguish, that which the Objector did <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>f Compare</HI> Mat. 22. 24. <HI>with</HI> Mar. 12. 19.</NOTE> tumble into a confused heap, and then from thence he drew wrong inferences:
<PB N="116" REF="62"/>
He should better have bethought himself, that, when he would speak of the na∣ture and Essence of a thing, (as particularly of a Sign or Ceremony) and doth so define it, that according to his own philosophical way, all definitions of any thing should be universal, or universally agreeing to the thing defined, where-ever it is found; it must be universally affirmed of that thing, where-ever it hath a Being.</P>
<P>Whereas it is discovered, that there is a Sign of Sanctification, which yet is not so in his sense, There are some natural Signs of this; of sanctified Seasons separate for holy Services. The Heavenly Luminaries were, are, and will be such Signs. There is a notifying testifying-certifying Sign of Sanctification. Both these, the Weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, has been, is and will be. It doth bespeak Holiness in the Nature and Being, in the Name and Thing of it, to the due observers of it; and therefore doth widely differ from that which is meerly Ceremonial. And both these Signs, are Signs to all <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Compare</HI> Psal. <HI>throughout with</HI> Rom. 10. 18. <HI>and</HI> Deut. 30. 11-14. <HI>with</HI> Rom. 10. 5.-1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> mankind.

<P>I now return unto a further passage in a former (another from this last) Objector.</P>
<P>The next Particular to be demonstrated, is, that the new Worship was Typi∣cally signified in the figuring Pattern of old. So that, neither doth this make any change at all upon the weekly Sabbath, to make it pass from one day of the Week unto another, from the seventh to the first.</P>
<P>For as for that Typical Figuring Worship, which was a part of the Pattern under that Administration, in Types, Shadows, Figures and Rites, which was performed on the Seventh-day Sabbath, that way of Worship by Sacrifices of Lambs, by Meat and Drink offerings, Incense, and such like; <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> 2. 16, 17.

In part. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 9, 10.</NOTE> as to this part, these were perfected and accomplished in and by Christ, when born of the Vir∣gin <HI>Mary;</HI> when living, dying, rising, ascending: But the Seventh-day Sabbath stands firm, as one of the ten Words; which are another sort of Laws, that do abide for ever. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 4. &amp; 9. 23.</NOTE> This Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> doth expresly affirm, that the Spiritual, Heavenly things of this New Testament of Glory, were in the Pattern under the Old. The parts of Worship now, were then only in a more shadowy, figuring manner; and therefore you may find the same things, as well as words, transferred out of the Old, into the New Testament. Only spiritu∣alized in the new. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Heb. 13. 8-15. Rom. 3. 25. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Rom. 12. 1.

Had this Ingager on the side, for the cause of the first Day, given instances in any particulars of VVorship, in the place where he speaks of new VVorship, it might have been discovered, that the same was in the Pattern of Old, to which Types then, the Antitypes now, do directly, ex∣actly answer. If a skilful experienced Believer would write an exact Com∣mentary upon the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixteenth Chapters of <HI>Levitious</HI> (not now to mention much more in that Book, and in <HI>Exodus, Num∣bers</HI> and <HI>Deuteronomy:)</HI> and take off the Veil from them, and give forth the true, intended, spiritual, significant meaning of them, by a collating of other suitable Scriptures, particularly in the New Testament; Every spiritual Discerner may quickly see, there was Gospel-worship, even then, only differently for the manner, dispensed.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of old were <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 11. Col. 2. 11-17.</NOTE> Types, and Figures, and Shadows, instituted of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> for these ends amongst others, to be signifying Seals of the assurance of Christ's coming in the fulness of time, to accomplish them; and of those good things which Believers had then, have now, and shall have, in af∣ter time, in and by him; <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 16, 17. 1 Pet. 2. 5, 9.

These were of old Signs and Seals of Regeneration, of Justification, of Sanctification, of Accepta∣on, of Salvation, and of eternal Life, <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 1.</NOTE> they were shadows of good things to

come, which shadows did continue <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 10.</NOTE> until the time of correction, at the coming of Christ in the Flesh, born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which Christ was <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Col. 2. 17.</NOTE> the Body of these things themselves, the express form, the summary substance of them. They were now to pass into the spiritual things signified; as those Typical Fi∣guring, signifying, sealing Ordinances, and Institutions of the New Testament Dispensation of Grace, Baptism and the Supper of the LORD, do really to be∣lieving partakers of them represent glorious things, and will do so, <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11 24, 25, 26.</NOTE> till Christ come to make all things new. The forementioned time of correction did then eminently begin, when Christ <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Luk. 2. 11.</NOTE> first openly shewed himself to be the same <HI>Messiah,</HI> the same God manifested in the flesh (for he was born a Saviour:) Of whom all the Prophets had foretold: And it had still a further progress, as he passed further on in his life, fulfilling all Righteous Observances; as after∣wards by his Death and Resurrection; The thorough perfection of which time of correction, was when he ascended up into the Heavens: The Holy of Ho∣lies there. So that, if we speak of God thus manifested in the flesh; thus was Redemption Work in the Antitype carried on, the complete finishing thereof, was upon Christ's going up to his Father from Earth to Heaven. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 1, 4, 5.</NOTE> For then, and not till then, was the thorough completed consummation of the Old Testa∣ment Administration; and then, and not till then, was the full perfect <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 1, 2.</NOTE> ini∣tiation of the New Testament Dispensation, as the Author of this Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> doth expresly declare it. If men will lay any more stress and weight, in their arguing about this, to any particular time and day, then the very form and the true Existence, and real Essence, and the consummating Consecration of that Priesthood of Christ, (which did set an end to, and did put down the Aaro∣nical and Levitical Priesthood, before which, the whole of the Antitypical Work of Redemption, so far as it did relate to the Priestly Office of Christ the Mediator between God and Man, was not perfectly filled up:) This doth stand and consist in those things, which do belong unto the <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 4, 5. &amp; 9. 23, 24. 1 Tim, 3. 16.</NOTE> Ascension of our LORD Jesus Christ into Glory: For, whilst Christ was on Earth, there were other Priests, which offered gifts according to the Law of the Pattern, who did serve unto the Pattern and Shadow of Heavenly things, of Heaven it self; and so long Christ had not the former typical Priesthood, so unchangeably, unpassingly to any other, passing into him as the Antitype; so long as he remained on Earth he was not such an High Priest, as the Author of this Epistle doth plainly word it; into which Heaven Christ did therefore ascend, to make <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 4, 5, 6. &amp; 9. 8, 11, 23. 24. &amp; 7. 16, 25. 26. vers. 25. <HI>To the full end.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> a full end of all those Old Testament Types and Figures, becoming now the glorious Mediator of the New Testament, which is established or legitimated in better Promises: The holy Spirit, hereby signifying this, that the way of this Heavenly San∣ctuary, the Holy of Holies was not yet made manifest to be perfectly accom∣plished, till Christ ascended there; whereby there is evident proof made, that the Aaronical Levitical Priesthood, being a Type, Figure, Pattern, and Shadow of this Coelestial, super-Coelestial Priesthood of Christ, did stil stand till then, and was not to give way and place, as a Type and Figure, unto the Antype and Truth, until this great High Priest Christ went into Heaven. The Birth, the Life, the Passion, the Death, the Resurrection, the Ascension of Christ, have <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Luk. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. Rom, 8. 32, 33, 34.</NOTE> every one of them, somewhat peculiar in them, as to the Redeeming-work, and must all of them be put together for the thorough completing of so good and so gracious, so great and so glorious a Work. But those who would make the Resurrection-day of Christ, to speak that about a pretended change of the weekly Sabbath, from the Seventh day to the first, should consider, that the perfect consummation of this Work in the Antitype, was at Christ's ascending up into Glory. Then did he Captive Captives unto himself, (which was done <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Ephes 4. 8.

But <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 7, 12, 25.</NOTE> Christ entred into Anti-typical Heaven once for all. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Heb 9. 5, 7, 12, 24, 25.</NOTE> The High Priest of old entred into the Type with the blood of Bulls and of Goats: Christ entred into Heaven with his own blood. <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 4.</NOTE> The High Priest appeared of old before the Ark for the people a little while, and then came away quickly agen: But Christ for <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9. 12.</NOTE> ever doth appear before God his Father, having hereby obtained Eternal Redemption for those who are his. What shall I more say about this? To expound the whole of the Old Testament pattern, as to the matters of wor∣ship, and in all the other parts of that Administration, and then to apply it in the new, how exactly one doth correspond to the other, were task enough for a long Life. That, the shadowy ceremonies, and figuring Types of the Old Te∣stament; as such, that is to say, as shadowy ceremonies and figuring Types, are done away, and leave no obligation of duty upon Believers under this New Te∣stament, ministration to observe and perform the outward part of them, I would thus demonstrate by Arguments drawn from <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ps. 40. 6, 7, 8. <HI>compared with</HI> Heb. 10. 5-9. Ps. 50. 7-14. Dan. 9. 27.</NOTE> those Propheties in the Old Testament, which do foretel this: The LORD Jesus Christ upon his coming in the flesh born of a Virgin, was to cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease, and thus he bespeaks his Father, <HI>Sacrifice and Oblation thou wouldest not: mine ears hast thou digged open; burnt-offering and sin-offering thou askedst not: Then said I, lo I come, in the Roll of the Book it is written of me. My God, I de∣light to do thy acceptable will; and thy Law is within my Bowels:</HI> Christ's Ear was digged open, it was pierced and became listning to his Father's call, and o∣bedient to his Father's voice; his Ears were bored by the Father, whose servant for ever Christ was: the Father fitted a Body to this beloved Son of his, prepa∣ring and ordaining it to be an ordinary and expiatory sacrifice for the sins of the World, it <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 1-4.</NOTE> being impossible, that ceremonial sacrifices should purge away sins, which therefore were now refused as unprofitable, and they received their per∣fection and accomplishment in Christ.</P>
<P>I argue further from those Scripture Names, which are given unto those Rites and Ceremonies, whereby their Nature is aptly expressed and significantly descri∣bed: sometimee they are set out by <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 7. 44. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 5. compa∣red with <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 24. <HI>&amp;</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 21.

They are in other places called <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 1. &amp; 8. 5.</NOTE> shadows, which are obscure representations of somewhat else that was the express form; they were a picturing delineation, and a well drawn Image, of Heavenly things, of future good things. They were <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Heb. 8. 5. &amp; 9. 23.</NOTE> exemplars, as so many Images, representing of Christ and of his benefits: They were <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Hebrews 9. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> a parable, or collation, an artificial prefiguring narration of somewhat else signified thereby; a form of Ritual Worship, which served for that time under that administration, putting somewhat that was visi∣ble before the eyes, which yet had a more inward mysterious meaning in it. They were <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 3. &amp; 6. 12. Heb. 9. 10. &amp; 7. 16.

The Reader should not here mistake me, as if I were in this against all the outward part of Worship now under the New Testament, whilst I declare the abolishing of those external sacrifices, and outward Rites which were Typical and figuring of old. A just respect of outward reverence, is due unto <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> where he doth mani∣fest his gracious presence: Here is a duty of veneration to be expressed by out∣ward gesture. Although the inward Worship be principally in several respects intended and required, yet the outward and bodily part is not excluded but en∣joyned also, such as elevation of the Eye and palms of the Hands, bowing, kneeling, and the like, where meet circumstances of time and place, and other parts of the case are fitted for it: The LORD made <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.</NOTE> the body of Man to be worshipped and glorified by, as well as the Spirit and Soul, and Believers have a

promise, and so are under expectation, of having their bodies glorified as well as their spirits and souls, in the World and Life to come: and if they look for a glorifying reward, they should perform a worshiping work: though the inward worship be the life of the outward worship, yet the outward must be expressive of the inward, the one is not complete without the o∣ther. Where there is only the outward worship without the inward, there the worship doth not so commend it self to God, not being well testified before him, who searcheth the Heart, <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">John 4. 23, 24.</NOTE> and who being a Spirit, will be worshipped in Spi∣rit, and if there be only inward worship, without the outward worship, there the worship is not well witnessed <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 4-15.</NOTE> before Men and Angels. The outward bo¦dily part of idolatrous worship by gesture and posture, as a testification of ho∣mage, is for that cause a sin, <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 4, 5. 1 King. 19. 18. Hos. 13. 2.

<P>I hasten now to evidence in the Word of Truth, That,</P>
<P>The Law of Faith, was a Law under the Old Testament Dispensation.</P>
<P>Here to avoid mistakes and cavils, (for, we are for standing upon plain firm ground, having the whole Scripture in plain express words for the Weekly Se∣venth day Sabbath:) I notice the Reader, that to believe actually in the <HI>Messiah,</HI> as Mediator between God and Man, and actually to believe in this <HI>Messiah,</HI> as he that was in the Fulness of Time to come in the Flesh, born of a Virgin, was a Law under the Old Administration. And to believe actually in that parti∣cular person, this Christ, when come in the Flesh, as so born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> is a Law of the New Testament; yet so, as that this <HI>Quateneity,</HI> as so born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> is one part of the New Testament Ministration, properly as such; and so in that respect doth belong to another matter. And thus in some places Faith doth set out the New Dispensation of Grace. The short and plain is this; Faith in the <HI>Messiah,</HI> or in Christ, was a Law under the Old Testament-dispensation; or it was then a commanded Duty to believe in Christ; which was to be done in obedience to a Law of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim.</HI></P>
<P>For the Advancement of this sort of profitable Learning, I propound these following Inquiries; which if well cleared up from Scripture, might bring in some considerable Augment to this Holy Science.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Whether there be not convincing evidence in the Word of Truth, that fallen <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> did actually repent, and believe in the <HI>Messiah</HI> for Justification, Acceptation and Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What Names are there in the Old Testament given to Christ, which do set
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>
him out, as Mediator, as Saviour, as the Justifier of his people, and as being their Righteousness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What Types, and Figures, and Shadows were there of this Doctrine of Faith in the <HI>Messiah,</HI> under old Testament Dispensation?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Whether, if all the Hebrew expressions were put together, that in the Old Testament are expressive * descriptions of Faith, Trust, Hope, Expectation in the New, with all the Synonyma's and Phrases referring to this subject mat∣ter, it would not discover much of lively Faith in the Saints, under that for∣mer Dispensation?</P>
<P>That, Faith was a Law under the Old Testament Dispensation, I thus de∣monstrate, both in the general significancy of the word, grounded on the Al∣mightness, and Faithfulness of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> and also in the special accepta∣on it; for closing with, applying of, relying on, <HI>Jehovah</HI> the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and his Righteousness, for justification in the sight of God.</P>
<P>In its general significancy, it has a firm Foundation, a rockie bottom, even <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Gen. 1. 15. 1, 6. Rom. 10. 17. Heb. 11. 3. 1 Pet. 1. 22. 2 Thess. 2. 13. Rom. 4, 20. Heb. 11. 1, 6.</NOTE> the Power and Truth of the omnipotent unchangeable <HI>Jehovah,</HI> a God of ability to perform, and of veracity to fulfil, what he has spoken and promised. Every Word and Truth of God revealed, is the general, and common object of Faith. A lively working belief of this; though seemingly but in the general, yet has great influence upon the special actings of justifying Faith; for the Scri∣ptures do give us instances of too much, and too often questioning the Power and Fidelity of <HI>Aelohim,</HI> in his Word and Promises, in some particular trying Cases, as long hiding of his Faces, great withdrawing, delay of fulfilling of Propheties and Promises, not answering of Prayer, carrying himself as one angry at the very Prayers of his people; much conflicting with, and yet frequent foyl∣ing by some particular bewailed, confessed corruption, under violent tempta∣tions, the LORD's seeming forsaking of his Churches and people, his shining upon, and prospering of the Enemies of the LORD, and of his people, his seem∣ing to act contrary in his works, from what he covenanteth in his Word; with more of this kind.</P>
<P>But, I suppose, that it is the notion of Faith in its special acceptation, that is intended by this pretended new Law of Faith in this Objection: That this Faith in Christ is now in more clearness, spiritualness, evidence, growingness, heavenlyness, for the manner and degrees of it, we thankfully and admiringly, acknowledge to the praise of God, of rich Grace, and of free Love, who has brought us under this new and more glorious Administration. But, there was the same Grace of Faith in Truth, and in reality, for its Nature and Essence, in the savingness and justifyingness of it, for the kind and specifickness of it, under the Old: This we also affirm, was it not this saving and justifying Faith which the Author of the Epistle <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 38. <HI>&amp;</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. throughout: <HI>&amp;</HI> 12. 1, 2.</NOTE> to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> do speak of, when he said, <HI>The just by faith shall live?</HI> Those who are justified, counted just by Faith in Christ, ap∣plying him and his Righteousness, shall live that life of Grace, and of Comfort, of support and stay, of waiting, and of dependance here, which shall pass into an eternal life of Glory, of full Vision, Injoyment, and Happiness. And was not this Testimony brought out of the <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Habak. 2. 4. Rom. 1. 17. Gal. 3. 11. Heb. 10. 38.</NOTE> Old Testament, which is used once and again, and a third time in the new? And in every one of the places in the new, it is applyed with respect to Justification by Faith in Christ. So in the Epistle to the <HI>Romans;</HI> the Righteousness of God (of Christ who was God as well as Man, for the complete satisfactory righteousness of such an one did we stand in need of:) is revealed in the same Gospel of Christ from Faith to Faith; as it is written, <HI>But the just by faith shall live:</HI> That Righteousness by which a Believer doth stand justified before the Judgement Seat of God, and can be no other Righteousness, but only the Righteousness of Christ, this is a free gift from the Father, and is through the inworking of the holy Spirit, by Faith imputed to Believers. The like sense it has in that passage of the Epistle to the
<PB N="122" REF="65"/>
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11.</NOTE> <HI>Galatians;</HI> that no man by the Law is justified before God is mentioned; for <HI>the just by faith shall live;</HI> referring again to that place in <HI>Habakkuk,</HI> whereby to prove justification by Faith in Christ only, as the Context doth evidently declare: And thus in the formentioned passage to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> having in the last verse but one of the tenth Chapter, cited that Scripture in the Old Testament, the Author proceeds in the first verse of the eleventh Chapter to describe the true spiritual Nature of saving justifying Faith; and he gives particular Instances and Examples of the Saints of old, who acted this Faith. Was it not <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 4. Mat. 23. 35. Gen. 3. 15. &amp; 4. 4. &amp; 1 John 3. 12.</NOTE> by this Faith, in the promised Seed of the Woman, in Christ, that <HI>Abels</HI> person and Sacrifice was acceptable to God, and by which he obtained witness, that he was Righteous, and so justified in the sight of God? Was it not by this Faith that <HI>Enoch</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 5.</NOTE> pleased God who gave him this Testimony, and was therefore ho∣noured with the priviledge of walking with God here, and then of Gods taking him away to himself? Was it not <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 6, 7. 2 Pet. 2. 5.</NOTE> by this Faith, that <HI>Noah</HI> prepared the Ark, as a Type of Christ, by which he became an heir of the Righteousness, which is according to Faith? Of which Righteousness, of Justification by Faith in the <HI>Messiah, Noab</HI> was Preacher to others? Was it not <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 8-19. Gen. 15. 1, 5, 6.</NOTE> by this Faith; that <HI>Abraham</HI> was justified? Did not he believe God? <HI>Jebovah</HI> the <HI>Messiah,</HI> who appeared to him? And was it not accounted to him for Righteousness? And is not this brought in by <HI>Paul</HI> in his <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. <HI>throughout; and</HI> Gal. 3. 6-18.</NOTE> Epistles to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> to prove the Doctrine of Justification by Faith in Christ, by his Righteousness im∣puted to the Believer? Did not <HI>Abraham</HI> receive the Sign of Circumcision, as a Seal of this Righteousness of Faith, which was thus imputed to him? Is not <HI>Abraham</HI> propounded as an Example to after-Believers in this? being called the Father of all that believe, in the Foot steps of whose Faith after-Believers are to walk? For what was so counted to him for Righteousness, was written, not for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for the sake of <HI>Paul,</HI> and of others in <HI>Paul</HI>'s time; and so still for our sakes, in the present day, to whom it shall be imputed, namely to them that do believe in him; <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Deut. 30. 11-14. Rom. 10. 6-9.</NOTE> what <HI>Moses</HI> doth speak of the Duties of the Law, <HI>Paul</HI> doth interpret of the Faith of the Gospel. It would fill up much paper to inlarge in all the other instances of the old Te∣stament-Believers, recorded in the new, particularly in that eleventh Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> There is <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 4. 5.</NOTE> one Faith; one and the same Doctrine of Faith, to be believed; and one and the same Grace of Faith, by which men do believe, for Justification and Salvation, both under the Old and New Testament. It was the open confession of <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Acts 15. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI>'s Faith in one of the first Councils or Synods, held in the New Testament, when the Apostles and Elders were assembled to∣gether to debate some weighty Question of the Christian Religion; <HI>We believe,</HI> saith he, <HI>by the Grace of the LORD Jesus Christ, to be saved in such manner as they also; as the believing Fore-fathers under the Old Testament were, merely through free Grace, by Faith in Grace, by Faith in Christ, in his righteousness.</HI>
<HI>They by Faith in Christ, who was then to come to be in due time born of the Virgin, which was held forth in Types of old to this end; We in Christ, as the perfect Anti-type thus already come.</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 1, 2, 3, 6.</NOTE> The Analogy of Faith in both Testaments should be attended unto by a diligent discerning Reader of the Word, a due proportional collating of them, between and to each other, would discover the uniformness and well-agreingness of the Will of our LORD in them both, by a particular right application and limitation of their Analogy, the orderly regulation where∣of must be made according to that measure and number of proportion, which the different manner of dispensing doth call for, and no further is it to be ad∣mitted, as to any substantial and essential part of the Christian Religion; there is a likeness of Word, a sameness of Sense, a oneness of intendment on them both, unto which Analogy he must keep close, who would give forth a true ex∣plication of sound Doctrine. That Faith, which is required and promised in the Covenant of Grace, is for the substance of it, one and the same Grace, which is commanded in the Law of the ten Words; and let it be further re∣searched into by the ingenuous for the augment of this Spiritual Science; Whe∣ther the Faith of <HI>Adam</HI> in his innocence (I do not put here into this inquiry, as to the special use, and the proper object of it) were not for the substance of the
<PB N="123" REF="65"/>
Grace one and the same with the New Covenant Grace of Faith? Was not <HI>Adam</HI> in all things to give confident credence to all as to every Truth which <HI>Aelohim</HI> his Creator had revealed or should further reveal, was he not bound to believe in the promised <HI>Messiah</HI> by the Law of Creation and of Nature, as soon as ever <HI>Jeho∣vah</HI> should reveal this to him? The whole Scripture is profitable for this do∣ctrine, of the oneness and sameness of old and New Testament Faith, and I am perswaded after some years research into the word of Truth, about this matter, and long experience suited thereunto, that one great occasion at least, if not cause, of the Apostasies and Backslidings of some, of the loose ungospel-like, and ill-principled-conversation of others, and of the practical Atheism and Infi∣delity of some others, and of the doubts and fears, and unprofitable walking of other some, has been men's unscriptural unwarrantable setting up of so many different Religions in the Old and New Testament, and the urging of some one, or a few misunderstood, misinterpreted Scriptures, wrested and wryed to some particular purpose, contrary to the drift, and intent, and scope, of the whole Scripture besides, which doth write about that Case: Whereas the whole Scripture is uniform and harmonious, speaking with one mouth, one and the same thing. The only difference between the Old and the New, being in the mode of Administration, as has been opened once and again. Let me here further add, (seeing this Objector doth call this a New Law of Faith, as a part of the the New Creation; brought in and perfected particularly, and only upon the first day of the Week, and upon no other day, as he pretends:) that, this, Grace of Faith was put into a Law under the Old Testament Dispensation; for, besides that, if there had been no Law for this Faith, under that Dispensation, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 15, &amp; 5. 13. 1 John 3. 4.</NOTE> it had been no sin, no transgression not to have believed with that Faith; for sin is the transgression of some Law; and I have shewn, it was Christ manifesting himself to <HI>Moses</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> and in the wilderness, whom the Israelites did so often tempt, grieve, provoke, and not <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Psal. 18. 22, 32. Heb. 3. 12, 18, 19. &amp; 4. 2, 11.</NOTE> not believe. But further, Faith in that <HI>Je∣hovah Aelohim,</HI> who proclaimed the ten words at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> was a plain du∣ty, injoyned in the first word or command; and that Promulgator, I have proved to be the <HI>Messiah</HI> or Christ. So that it was a duty actually to believe him, to believe in him. Faith in the Lawgiver is <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Act. 18. 25. 26. 2 Chron. 20. 20.</NOTE> one of the ways and command∣ments of this <HI>Jehovah.</HI></P>
<P>I had here given a dismiss unto this (that I might hasten to the last particular:) but that I called to mind, how another adversary of, and objector against, the Seventh-day Sabbath had affirmed, that the Decalogue had less in it than the Law of Nature, and that therefore it was never intended for a mere or perfect Transcript of the Law of Nature. (Although, if he had improved his own concession, he might have seen how he tacitely gave an answer to his own Objection; for he says, That the chief Heads of Natutes Law are contained in the Decalogue:) He gives instances in divers particulars; some of the chief of them, in which he seems much to glory, I shall examine: In which he judgeth the Decalogue is defective, such as the belief of the Soul, to love our selves with a just and necessary Love, to fame and mortifie all our fleshly lusts, in order to our Salvation, to deny all bodily Pleasure, Profit, Honour, Liberty and Life, for the securing of our Salvation.</P>
<P>Let the considerate Reader now spiritually, according to the Word of Truth, discern in these matters. If the Scripture-rules of interpreting these ten Words, Laws or Commands be observed, allowed and applyed, it will be manifest, That they are a comprehensive, as for other things, so for the particulars specified; so far as doth concern the discharge of Duty, and the avoiding of Sin. These general Laws do take in more particulars, than is commonly observed, for the particulars are expressed by some word or other, in the general Law, which by collating of other Scriptures in the Original words and phrases doth evidently demonstrate this; which is well worth the noting and improving for the ad∣vancement of this decalogue-Science. The definition of every one of the ten Words, is so fully and comprehensively fitted, as they take in all the Laws of Natural Holiness and Righteousness: So that, we may say with the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Psal. 11, 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 97.</NOTE> <HI>Psal∣mist,
<PB N="124" REF="66"/>
In all perfection I have seen an end, but thy commandment, O Jehovah, is very large! O how I love thy Law!</HI></P>
<P>To believe that the Soul is what Scripture and Nature do say that it is, is comprehended in the Decalogue. The Maker and Giver of this Law is the best Interpreter of it. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Mat. 22. 35 —<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> When the Lawyer asked Christ, which was the great Commandment in the Law? The LORD Jesus answered him, <HI>Thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine un∣derstanding, and with all thy strength: This is the first and the great Command∣ment: and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. On these two Commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.</HI> Ob∣serve here, Is not the Soul particularly taken notice of in the expression? And that too, as a distinct, essential, constitutive part of man, from the spi∣rit and body? And is not this a Word to be believed? Is it not plain here, that the Scripture Doctrine of the Soul, is to be believed? And this as compre∣hended within the due bounds of the Decalogue? That Christ doth here speak of the Law of the ten words is evident, by collating of <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Mar. 12. 28.-34. Luk. 10, 25.-28.</NOTE> other Scriptures, which do historically relate the same thing, where the Preface, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Deut. 5. 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Rom. 13. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>Hear, O Israel,</HI> doth shew, that it is meant of this Law of the ten words, seeing there is a particular enumeration of several of the ten Words in express terms. Which ten Words do summarily contain the whole Doctrine of Holiness, and of Righteousness, whatsoever the Law and the Prophets do speak of: And how much is there in these concerning the Doctrine of the Soul? This exposition of the Law-maker himself, is a sufficient warranting of this interpretation; For, he doth make the sum of the first Table, (to which the four first words do belong:) to be the loving of <HI>Jehovah</HI> our <HI>Aelohim, with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our might.</HI> And the sum of the second Table; (which takes in the six last words:) to be; <HI>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</HI> And <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mar. 12. 30. Luk. 12. 30. Luk. 10. 27.</NOTE> the expressions which Christ doth use, are remarkable; the whole Heart; the whole Soul, the whole Strength; the whole Mind; which words do take in the whole Power, and Powers of the inner and outer man. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> The whole strength doth more properly set out the might of the Body, in the external Mem∣bers, Limbs and Parts of it. The whole Heart doth express all the Inwards of the bodily fleshy part of man: The whole Mind doth call for the Vigour and A∣ctivity, the light and life of the Spirit of Man: The spirit of a Man is naturally Luminous, and has Light enough in it to demonstrate his Being, to be distinct from the respiring faculty in Man. So that the whole in his All, and in every part of him is concerned and engaged in this Love. And all these words thus put together, do discover and declare, that this Law of the Ten Words doth ex∣tend to Spirit, Soul and Body; both the External and Internal parts of the Bo∣dy: which three do constitute and make up a complete Man. And the LORD can make this good use of this part of the Answer, to put the Readers upon fur∣ther Inquiries into the Word of Truth, after the true nature and proper diffe∣rence of their Spirits, Souls and Bodies, and what the distinct duties of each are, and wherein they must all joyntly agree in obeying this precept of Love. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 21.</NOTE> The Fourth Word doth declare <HI>Jehovah Aelohim</HI> to be the Maker of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all things that are therein; and the Soul of Man is one of these things which he created and <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai.</HI> 57. 16. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 7. and in other places.</NOTE> made. It is of the Law of Nature agreeably to the Word to believe, that souls are, and that there is a Maker of them. And that it is a duty, both to get more of the knowledge of our souls, and with our souls, to love and honour the Creator of them.</P>
<P>To love our selves with a just and necessary Love, as such, is of the Law of Nature; <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Prov. 8. 36.</NOTE> <HI>He that doth it not is a Self Murderer,</HI> he doth kill somewhat or other of himself, which is against the express Letter of the Sixth Word.

(In the way, men should use more tenderness in their expressions about these holy Laws of Christ; upon which he himself doth put so much honour. This Adversary doth sometimes call it a Jewish Law, and here <HI>Moses</HI>'s Decalogue, when he had before and af∣ter, written so much diminitively about these ten Words; whereas the Scri∣ptures do name them with more honour, <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Exod. 34. 28. Deut. 20. 4. &amp; 4. 13.</NOTE> the Words of the Covenant, the ten Words, the ten Words which <HI>Jehovah</HI> spake, which he gave unto <HI>Moses. Moses</HI> called them, the ten Words of <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Covenant, which <HI>Jehovah</HI> wrote upon two Tables of Stone: with many more of such glorious Names and Titles. But to my matter in hand:)</P>
<P>If these Duties of self love are supposed, where are they supposed, if not in this present comprehensive Law? which doth include all Duties? <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Mat. 22. 39. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Luk. 10. 27.</NOTE> Christ's Rules of Interpreting do expresly take in self-love, making this commanded Duty of self-love, to be the measure of our Love to our Neighbour; the one must be regulated by the other according to the Word. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Mat. 7. 12.</NOTE> In his own Com∣mentary upon his own Law, he doth affirm, all the Law and the Prophets, to make a regular Love to our selves, to be <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Lev. 19. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> the measure of our Love to others. This Law of self-love is not then so passed by, but that in express terms, if we will take Christ for an Interpreter, it is a Duty required in the Law of the ten Words. Both Old and New Testament do speak one and the same thing in this matter; And men will never be thorowly true, right lovers of themselves, till their hearts and lives in a way of growing conformity, both in knowledge and in obedience, be more and better reconciled to this Law of the ten Words. Pure, Primitive, Created, Natural, Word self-love is eminent in an Universal Obedience, unto all the Holy, Righteous, Just Laws of <HI>Jehrvah Aelohim:</HI> They are good Laws, good to the observer of them. The LORD doth use this Ar∣gument, whereby to prevail with true, right self-lovers, keep all my Command∣ments <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Deut. 10. 12, 13.</NOTE> for thy good, Thy; the benefit and the advantage will be thy own. Thy Obedience thereby, will be profitable <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Job 22. 2.</NOTE> to thy self. Every one of the ten Words being directed to men, in the Second Person, doth stir up their natural, regular self-love; <HI>Thou shalt,</HI> or <HI>Thou shalt not.</HI> It is thy own great con∣cern; <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 5. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 29.</NOTE> For, there is a lawful regular self-love, <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 3. 2.</NOTE> as there is a sinful carnal self-love.</P>
<P>This also doth take in somewhat of another Instance of this Objector, about taking greatest care to save our Souls above our Bodies. For the Chain, and the order Lines of Love is held forth in the Decalogue. <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Mat. 22. 36, 37. 38, 39, 40.

<P>Further, to tame and mortifie all our fleshly Lusts in order to our Salvation: Is not this also precepted in the Decalogue? Where any Duty is there com∣manded, do not also the means pointed thereunto pass under precept? Thus, where any sin is forbidden, are not there also the causes and occasions of such a sin forbidden? And are not there also the means instituted for the avoyding such a sin injoyned? Are not Lusts and Corruptions, the whole old man of them, the original indwelling sin, which is the root and the corrupt Fountain, whence all other sins and corruptions do spring and flow, are not these forbid∣den in the Law of the ten Words? Doth not <HI>Paul</HI> evidently argue this in the seventh Chapter of his Epistle to the <HI>Romans?</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 13.

Are we not by virtue of this, and of other of these Laws, to forbear those acts of Gluttony, Drunkenness, Adultery, and such like, as they tend to our own damnation? Where the express charges for mortification are given to us, do they not evidently refer to the particular Laws of the ten Words? <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 5, 8, 9, 18, 19, 20, 21, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. &amp; 4. 1.</NOTE> Mortifie your members which are upon the Earth, Fornication, Un∣cleanness

So that as this is a Duty under the New, so also it is a Duty under the Old: And if so, it must be by virtue of one or other of the ten VVords; for on these do all the Law and the Prophets, the whole Old Testament, hang as to matters of com∣mands or Prohibitions, though it take in other matters too.</P>
<P>To deny all bodily Pleasure, Profit, Honour, Liberty and Life, for the se∣curing of our Salvation, regular self-love, as it is a Law of Nature, doth di∣ctate, and is a great part of that which the LORD Jesus Christ, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Mat. 22. 35-40. Mar. 12. 28-34. Luk. 10. 25-28.</NOTE> in that cut∣ting of the ten VVords into two Comprehensives of them, doth call the second Commandment: For Love to the Honour of <HI>Jehovah Aelohim,</HI> is the first and chief Commandment, and must be mainly put forth in this case, though it were to the parting with our any thing, our all. Are there not eminent Examples of this under the Old Testament; which have an honourable Record in the New? Did not <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 7. 1 Pet. 3. 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>Noah</HI> go far in this of self denyal, when he opposed all that corrupt age?

(VVas not this to deny all bodily pleasure?) when he by Faith, esteemed the reproach of, or for Christ (observe, there was a Christ then, and <HI>Moses</HI> rejoyced in his be∣ing persecuted for Christ's sake, because great was his reward in Heaven, which is an answer to another Instance of this Objector:) greater riches than the Trea∣sures in <HI>Egypt?</HI> (VVas not this to deny all profit?) when he by Faith forsook <HI>E∣gypt,</HI> not fearing the wrath of the King, for he was constant, as seeing him who is invisible?

Must not this Faith have some Word from <HI>Jeho∣vah</HI> to bottom upon? O how honourable are these things of this glori∣ous Law.</P>
<P>This puts me on towards the closing of my great undertaking, which is to shew, That</P>
<P>The Old Law of the ten Words is still the same, both to Jew and Gentile. It
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>
was the Rule of Obedience to them under the Old Testament, as unto God in Christ, and is still so a Rule unto us under the New.</P>
<P>In my entrance upon this, I must express my a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horrence of that bold daring∣ness, in some, who charge the LORD Jesus Christ himself, with being in his life-time a coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enancer of some breaches of the Seventh-day Sabbath. Thus fly∣ing in the face, not only of this holy Law, but also of the Supreme Lawgiver. They give two Instances: one in the twelfth of <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the beginning of that Chapter; the other in the fifth Chapter of <HI>John,</HI> the ninth, tenth, and so on to the sixteenth Verse. As to the the former, concerning Christ's Disciples plucking the Ears of Corn, and eating, on the Seventh-day, and Christ's plead∣ing their Cause, Consider well their Case, in all the Circumstances of it. They did what was lawful on the Seventh day, it being a needful refreshing of their outer man, thereby to strengthen for Sabbath-worship and Service, where other provision was wanting, a work of Mercy, as Christ shewed it to be; an action tending towards the Sanctification of the Sabbath, and not bringing any Duty thereof. It was according to what the Law of <HI>Jehovah</HI> did allow, in the two last Verses of the twenty third Chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> which had founda∣tion in right Nature, and in just Equity amongst all Mankind, who did allow this in a case of present necessity. And this Christ's doth further exemplifie in a like case of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the later: Where Christ healed the man diseased, and bid him, <HI>To take up his bed and walk:</HI> And this on the Sabbath-day. The diseased man was there on his bed, in the way of his cure; a cure was lawful on the Sabbath-day, a doing good on such a day, a work of necessity, and of mercy; and so lawful. This was a Work that the diseased man could not foresee, or prevent before the Sabbath came; nor being healed, was he to delay it till the Sabbath was over; left he had lost that of his goods, which his duty was so to preserve; (the Creator on the Seventh-day Sabbath preserved his Creatutes, which he had made on the six foregoing days of the same week) It was a publick Testi∣mony of the truth of the Cure, and of the power of the Healer, who as God-man spake the cure; It was an act of Faith and of Obedience, in him who was whole, and did not hinder any Sabbath-worship: For you may find him in the Temple, in the fourteenth Verse.</P>
<P>Having already proved, that the LORD Jesus Christ was Admininistrator under the Old Testament: and that he was the Promulgator of the Law of the ten Words at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> who was to be believed and obeyed in that Day, as well as now; and that, the end of the Law also, the great design, drift, pur∣port, and meaning of it was, Christ for Righteousness to every one that be∣lieveth: That which is now upon my hand to defend and maintain is, that it is still a Rule of Obedience now unto the New Testament; for the confutation of <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Mat. 24. 12.</NOTE> Anomy or Antinomianism.</P>
<P>This Law of the ten Words was confirmed by the express Doctrine of our LORD Jesus Christ, when he took to his God-head the Humane Nature, born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and dwelt here on Earth, and conversed with men for some years, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Mat. 5th, 6th and 7th Chap∣ters.</NOTE> particularly in his Sermon at the Mount.

The Will of the LORD, concerning what is or is not to be done, which way soe∣ver he has revealed it to all, or to any of Mankind, is still the same with this holy, righteous Law, when ever he has signified to man, what his requirements from man in these matters are: Unto his Will must the will of all Mankind be conformed; all Mankind is always bound to will that, which God would have them to will; all Mankind, who have the use and the exercise of right Reason, cannot but acknowledge, that the two great comprehensive Summaries of the ten Words do bind them all, which are, <HI>To love the LORD our God with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind; and to love our neigh∣bour as our selves;</HI> all are reduced to this bipartite Universal Law. Though the LORD variously reveal his Will and his Word for the manner, yet his Will and his Word is one and the same for the Matter. That Law of the ten Words, which was written on Tables of Stone, is the same in the true Nature of it, with that which is written in the hearts of men; all the ten Words are the prime dictates of right pure Nature, as soon as they are offered to a man's mind and cogitations, they presently command his assent and consent, and require his Faith and Obedience; they carry along with them a clear self-evidence, leaving no place for doubtingness, where the proper signification of the words is suffi∣ciently perceived, they are self-credible, and shine forth in their own light and authority, so consentaneous to innate light, is the whole matter of them; ex∣ternal Revelations thereof, do exactly agree to its internal expressions, this Law has been publickly Read and Preached in that Ministery of the Word, Which the Church did injoy in all Ages, a perpetual means, and a blessed Instrument which God hath used, for information in what is the Duty of Man, for convicti∣on what is sin in Man, and for exhortation to all Holiness, as an absolute Law, and an Universal Rule. There never was, never will be, a repeal of this Law, which is so lively an expression and draught of the Holy Righteous Nature of <HI>Aelohim</HI> himself. A perpetual duty has a perpetual binding; these Laws are necessary everlastingly, and so will the obligation be: Though the Preface of this Law be objected by some to be occasional and personal, the Law it self is per∣petual, and binding to all: Many of the Posterity of <HI>Israel</HI> were never literally themselves bond-slaves in <HI>Egypt,</HI> yet this Law bound them; some special new peculiar Reason may be brought to inforce a general Duty: The Mystical in∣tendment of that Preface, doth belong even to us Gentiles; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Psal. 66. 6.

As for those Objectors, who quarrel at their scriptural, natural command, by their supposition, that under the seventieth, and so onward to the nintieth degree, the day continues in one place about two Months toge∣ther, in another about four Months, and in another about six Months out right; these Calenders upon their own supposition should inquire, whether ever the LORD did appoint such places for <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Acts 17. 26.</NOTE> habitation unto Mankind?

As for the people of half-year-night, and of half-year-day, or of any people near either the North or South Pole, where some say is continual Day-light for many years together: Where do the holy Scriptures make mention of any such people, whom the LORD would have so to measure their time? they are Scripture-days, which we must stick to, and reckon by. A Day is not properly merely Time, but a well proportioned

measure of Time: Nights and Days, Weeks, and Months, and Years, have their constant motions, their successive courses, their unchangeable periods, and renewed returns. In every Nation and Country, where-ever men do inhabite, they must begin the Seventh day at that time, when that Seventh-day doth na∣turally begin in that place; and some of the Objectors do acknowledge that, even in those Climates between seventy and ninety Degrees, there is an equiva∣lent space of time, measured by hours, days, weeks, months and years, by which they overthrow most of the force of their own Argument. God commanded no impossibility in Nature, in requiring a determinate day in every week to be kept, as a weekly Sabbath by man, by all mankind, though some daringly would infer the quite contrary. We must take the Seventh-day as the Crea∣tor hath made, and continued it to us: The Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, is not bottomed upon Ethnick Philosophy, which has corrupted the Principles of Astronomy, and of Geometry, of Theology, and of Christianity, but upon holy Scriptures, and created Nature. The Seventh-day Sabbath, instituted and commanded in Paradise, and renewed, and re-inforced at Mount <HI>Horeb,</HI> (neither of which places were in the lesser <HI>Judaea,</HI> or <HI>Canaan,</HI> and therefore, this Law of the fourth Word was not a local Precept, of force no where but in that lesser <HI>Judaea</HI> and <HI>Canaan,</HI> as some affirm; this Seventh day Sabbath) is such a kind of day, as may be known, kept and observed by men: where-ever they should inhabit: That day in every week, which followeth the six foregoing known days of labour, is none of ours; it is the day of <HI>Jehovah;</HI> he hath plainly pointed it out to us in this Law; none need to say, the know∣ledge hereof is hidden from us, who shall ascend for us into Heaven, and bring the knowledge thereof to us, that we may know it, and observe it? it is clearly demonstrated to us by <HI>Aelohim</HI> himself: we may not make the Sabbath-day the sixth day, for then we should shew our selves unthankful in not receiving the LORD's own bountiful allowance unto us of six days for labour in our particular Functions: Neither are we to make it the eight day, for then we in∣croach on the LORD's Right, and are not contented with his liberal Grant of six days for our own employments. It might be asked of these Objectors, whether God have any Covenant People near the North Pole and South Pole? if so, whether they have not the Scriptures?

The first Creational days and week were the just measure of every after week, and of the days thereof in the ordinary course, succession, and revolution; and particularly the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh days of that first created week were measured out by the heavenly luminaries, and the three foregoing days of that week were of the same nature. As to evening, darkness and night going before the after morning, light, and day: all and every of the seven days of that week, As days, were such as the after-days, and were the measure of after-days in their stated order; it was night and day in the several parts of the earth, as it is now: the well setled frame of the standing statute of created Nature is not to be inverted. Could not, did not, the creating <HI>Aelohim</HI> carry the foregoing created evening, darkness and night, and the following, morning light and day in the same moments of time to cause the same beginnings, continuings and endings of nights and of days, wheresoever and whensoever it is night and day, any where, in any part of the earth then as it is now? Dark∣ness and light were severed, then both in nature and in time: this Author doth acknowledge a revolution of them on the first created day: and that, the night was before the day in one Hemisphere. From this part of the earth is the Scri∣pture account, in the opposite part it is Sea; by his own arguing, it could not be night every where at the same time, for light was in the other Hemisphere, and so the first day did not every where begin at the same time; for, it could not be day where it was evening and dark, nor night where it was morning and light; thus, has he intangled himself in his own net of humane reasoning, which he so spread to have catched seventh-day-sabbath observers. If when Sun, Moon, and Stars were created and put into their moving walks, on the fourth day, they made an universal day that so all seven might in a just propor∣tion of length and number answer to one another, as he affirmeth, Then at the same time it was night in some parts at full noon when the Sun shone in its strength and the light was clearest and fullest; and then also it was day in some parts at the mid of night when it was darkest (as the two parts of a natural day are distinguished) and yet both these he asserts to be an universal day, contrary to Scripture and Nature, he saith, a little after, that, Sun setting was in some places on the fourth day before Sun-rising, and therefore it may be inferred ac∣cording to this concession, that, it was night in some places when it was day in other places; in other places it was Sun-rising before it was Sun-setting; he, who would make it otherwise in respect of the wide earth, must take this Au∣thors bare words for it without any proof: our weeks and the days thereof here in <HI>England</HI> are as the first week and the days thereof were at the first creation of this part of the earth, unless he can evidence, that it was since that brought hi∣ther from some other part of the earth, and if he could do that, yet it would make nothing for the proving of his main general assertion, whilst the main of the present inhabited earth doth stand firmly in the same place where it was at the first before it was inhabited.</P>
<P>There is one part of his objection, which doth expect to have somewhat re∣plyed to it, wherein he thus argueth and reasoneth; our Sunday sabbath, saith he, is the very same day of the week, which was anciently observed by Jews and Gentiles for the solemn day of their solemn weekly worship, beginning at the light part or morning of the day, before <HI>Israels</HI> coming out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and after that by the Gentiles, and since Christs time by Gentil pagans and by Gentil-Christians, thus far he, the proof whereof, he referreth us to some humane Authorities, having quite contrary humane histories, which do relate a different practice, some whereof I am upon this occasion even necessitated to point unto;
<PB N="143" REF="75"/>
for, it is Scriptural Authority and Law, and created nature and order, which we resort unto for the proof of our position, and therefore the Reader is here de∣sired to bear a little herewith, seeing I am even driven into it, so many several Treatises having been sent and brought unto me, which some are under a tem∣ptation to misjudge to be unanswerable, unless somewhat be said and written to stop the mouths of such gain-sayers.</P>
