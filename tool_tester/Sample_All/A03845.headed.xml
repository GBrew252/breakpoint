<P>The reading of this <HI>Epitome,</HI>

besides the knowledge of the
<HI>True GOD,</HI> which is the

whereof our <HI>ARGENIS</HI> was

ignorant; and as for <HI>Con∣stancy,

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>entle Reader, my hu∣mor
inclining to Me∣lancholy,
induces me
sometimes, to seeke in
my Closet for some diversion, in
the reading of Bookes, suteable
to a Gentlewoman of my quality,
and of eighteene yeeres of age;
That is it wherein I have most per∣ticularly
applied my selfe this
Christmas, and amongst the rest,
in the reading of this Booke,
which hath pleased me; not only
for the subject whereof it treats,
but also, comming from the
hands of an Author, whose me∣mory
<PB REF="7"/>
I honor, though of a contra∣ry
Beliefe to mine, because that
being in France, in my Parents
company, I have heard a great
esteeme to be made of him, as of
the most learned Prelate of his
time. So as I might make my selfe,
so much the more perfect, in the
French tongue, I resolved to tran∣slate
it, for my owne particular
satisfaction, having no other de∣signe,
then to warme my selfe
therewith; as I have done with
some others: But I could not
make this Worke so secretly, but
that those who watch over my
actions, and endeavour my diver∣sion,
had notice thereof, by whom
I have beene in a manner forc'd
(least <HI>I</HI> should trangresse against
<PB REF="7"/>
the Law of God)▪ to expose it to
the publike view; And all the
favour which <HI>I</HI> could obtaine,
hath beene to suffer mee to make
choice of a second ARGENIS,
under whose Protection <HI>I</HI> sent it.
And J intreat thee, <HI>Gentle Rea∣der,</HI>
to oblige me so farre, as not
to presume that J doe it, out of
vanity; because it is not without
example, and could produce thee
many of my sexe, who have traced
me the way, witnesse the translati∣on
into French of Sir <HI>Philip
Sidneys Arcadia,</HI> the <HI>New Amaran∣tha,</HI>
and the <HI>Vrania,</HI> with many
others; neither have I done it to
be spoken of, knowing very well,
that those of, my sexe, who are
least spoken of, are the more to
<PB REF="8"/>
bee esteemed: But onely have I
done it by meere obedience and
duty, therefore I pray thee to ex∣cuse
the faults, if there be any, and
remember, that women (for the
most part) are unacquainted with
the studie of Sciences; and by
that meanes, may sooner erre; Also,
I esteeme that thou art Courteous
enough, to use mee according to
the courtesie and custome, due to
the Ladies of this Countrie, where
I was borne; And of whose Pri∣viledge
I make use, giving ARGE∣NIS
the precedency, rather then

AND

EPITOMIZ'D.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>ORTUNE proud and
insolent, beyond all ima∣ginationd,
emands a sump∣tuous
Theater, to cause
the might of <HI>Her Empire,</HI>
to appeare. It is in the <HI>Court</HI> of Great
<HI>Kings,</HI> where <HI>She</HI> elevates the Trophies
of <HI>Her</HI> tyranny, &amp; where <HI>She</HI> brandishes
<HI>Her</HI> vanity. It is there that <HI>She</HI> takes de∣light,
to breake a <HI>Scepter</HI> a sunder, to o∣verthrow
a <HI>Crowne,</HI> and to tread under
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
foot, all this pride of the earth, to the
end <HI>She</HI> might render <HI>Her</HI> victories, so
much the more glorious by such magni∣ficent
ruines, and <HI>Her</HI> Trophies the more
illustrious, by such noble spoiles. But if
amongst those Tragick accidents, <HI>She</HI>
doth afford some cause of contentment,
<HI>She</HI> doth temper it with so much bitter∣nesse,
that ordinarily, there is more
prickles then Roses found in <HI>Royalty.</HI>
This <HI>History</HI> is a lively portraiture ther∣of,
and causes us to see remarkable ex∣amples
in it.</P>
<P><HI>Meleander King of Sicily,</HI> possessing a
rich State, and seeing himselfe adored
by <HI>His</HI> subjects, who tasted with an ex∣traordinary
delight, the mildnesse of
<HI>His</HI> government, thought to be arrived
at the height of <HI>His</HI> glory. And that <HI>He</HI>
might say he was happy on all sides, <HI>He</HI>
was <HI>Father</HI> of a <HI>Daughter</HI> so accom∣plished
in all kinds of perfections, that
those who saw <HI>Her,</HI> imagined that <HI>Hea∣ven</HI>
had assembled all the treasures of
beauty, and gathered all the riches of
comlinesse, to forme this lofty <HI>Master∣peece</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
of nature. <HI>He</HI> imagined that this
yong <HI>Sunne,</HI> should be the ornament of
his <HI>Crowne,</HI> the prop of his <HI>State,</HI> the de∣light
of his <HI>Life,</HI> and the consolation of
his <HI>Old age.</HI> But men are ignorant of their
destinies, and know not what may be∣fall
them. The event then, made <HI>Him</HI>
know, that as the greatest lights are
subject unto the greatest shadows, so the
greatest prosperities are exposed un∣to
the greatest accidents, therefore one
must not so much trust unto the favours
of <HI>Fortune,</HI> but that one must dread <HI>Her</HI>
inconstancy.</P>
<P><HI>Argenis</HI> then was the name of the
<HI>Heire of Sicily,</HI> which ought to be as a
living spring of all goodnesse to <HI>Her Fa∣ther</HI>
and <HI>Her State,</HI> sees <HI>Her</HI> selfe to be
the subject of a furious and bloody
warre, raised by a <HI>Prince,</HI> one of <HI>Melean∣der's</HI>
subjects, who having had the te∣merity,
to aske <HI>Her</HI> in marriage, recei∣ved
the refusall which his presumption
merited. The image of this contempt,
made such a furious impression upon
this wilde and ambitious spirit, that to
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
take revenge, hee resolved to put the
<HI>Father</HI> out of the world, and to steale
away the <HI>Daughter</HI> to crowne his parri∣cide.
This execrable designe had come
to passe, if the <HI>Divinity,</HI> which hath a
speciall care of <HI>Crownes,</HI> and which loves
<HI>Kings,</HI> had not miraculously put by, the
misfortune whereof the <HI>Sicilian Scepter</HI>
was threatned. All <HI>Europe,</HI> and <HI>Affrick</HI>
also were filled with the rumor of <HI>Arge∣nis's</HI>
beauty, which was placed amongst
the wonders of the world and nature.
A thousand yong couragious spirits,
taken with <HI>Her</HI> love, had resolved to
serve <HI>Her,</HI> and to imploy all their indu∣stry
and valour, to insinuate themselves
in <HI>Her</HI> favour. Amongst the rest <HI>Poliar∣chus
Prince of France,</HI> and <HI>Heire</HI> of one of
the fairest <HI>Crownes</HI> in the world, suffe∣ring
<HI>Himselfe</HI> to bee transported with
this passion, sought out for this glory
with more successe then wisedome.
(But ought one to looke for any in
love?) Imagining in <HI>Himselfe</HI> that an
extraordinary beauty merited no com∣mon
pursuits; <HI>Hee</HI> left his <HI>Kingdome,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
and taking a <HI>Gentlewomans</HI> habit, crossed
the sea, and went to <HI>Sicily,</HI> where <HI>He</HI> in∣formed
<HI>Himselfe</HI> diligently of the place
where the <HI>Princesse</HI> was, to whom <HI>He</HI>
desired, with so much passion to offer
<HI>His</HI> service. <HI>Meleander</HI> fearing least de∣spaire
should cause <HI>Lycogenes</HI> to procure
some shame unto <HI>Her,</HI> had placed <HI>Her</HI> in
a strong Hold, where <HI>She</HI> passed the
time with <HI>Her</HI> maids, being visited of
none but <HI>Her Father,</HI> who sometime
going from <HI>Syracuse</HI> (which was not
farre from thence,) came to see <HI>Her,</HI> and
stayed with <HI>Her</HI> to divert <HI>Himselfe</HI> in
<HI>Her</HI> company. <HI>Poliarchus</HI> following <HI>His</HI>
designe, goes that way, and spying the
meanes, to enter in this agreeable soli∣tarinesse,
takes <HI>His</HI> journey towards <HI>Sy∣racuse,</HI>
where being arrived <HI>He</HI> finds
by good fortune <HI>Solenissa Argenis'ses</HI>
Governesse within the <HI>Temple of Iuno,</HI>
where <HI>She</HI> was at <HI>Her</HI> devotions. He
had learn'd in what ranke she was with
the <HI>Princesse. He</HI> cals her aside, and ha∣ving
cast <HI>Himselfe</HI> at her feet, beseeches
her to take pitty on the most unfortu∣nate
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<HI>Lady</HI> which the Sunne shined on,
on earth, and to give <HI>Her</HI> the meanes to
tell <HI>Her</HI> some thing, which could not be
knowne to any but she, unto whom <HI>She</HI>
brought letters from a great <HI>Princesse.</HI>
The <HI>Strangers</HI> comely behaviour, the
novelty of <HI>Her</HI> habit, and <HI>Her</HI> language,
which shewed <HI>She</HI> was not of the <HI>Court
of Sicily,</HI> caused in <HI>Selenissa</HI> a desire to
learne what <HI>She</HI> would say. Then going
out of the throng, <HI>She</HI> leads <HI>Her,</HI> to her
sisters house, and entred alone in a
Closet fit to receive <HI>Her</HI> most secret
thoughts. Then <HI>Poliarchus</HI> kissing the
letters gives them unto <HI>Her,</HI> and at last
leads so happily this enterprize, that <HI>He</HI>
causes himselfe to be taken for a <HI>French
Princesse,</HI> which the rage of <HI>Her Vncle</HI>
had driven into <HI>Sicily</HI> to looke out for
the refuge and surety, which <HI>She</HI> could
not finde in <HI>Her Realme</HI> amongst <HI>Her</HI>
friends. My name, said <HI>he,</HI> is <HI>Theocrine
the Kings daughter, and Sister unto the
Heire of the Crowne of France,</HI> whom this
parricide (who hath procured all my
mis-fortunes,) hath caused to be poiso∣ned
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
that hee might usurpe his <HI>Diadem.</HI>
That which made her to give more
faith unto his words, was, that calling
a Freed slave who gave <HI>Her</HI> a Cabinet,
which <HI>She</HI> had committed to his charge,
<HI>She</HI> drew forth the most exquisite rich∣es,
and the fairest precious stones, that
were ever seene in <HI>Europe;</HI> then with a
magnificence which truely resembled
a great <HI>Princesse,</HI> gave such a great num∣ber
unto <HI>Selenissa,</HI> that at the instant
(suffering her selfe to bee dazled with
their sparkling and radiation) <HI>She</HI>
bound her selfe with a strong tye of
affection unto <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> which she took
for <HI>Theocrine.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Theocrine</HI>
conjured her to embrace <HI>Her</HI> affaires,
and to procure that favour towards <HI>Ar∣genis,</HI>
that <HI>She</HI> might receive <HI>Her</HI> into
<HI>Her</HI> company, where <HI>She</HI> pretended not
to hold the ranke of a <HI>Princesse,</HI> but
would esteeme her selfe happy to hold
the quality of a <HI>Waiting-woman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Selenissa</HI> being touch'd with <HI>Her</HI> com∣plaints,
offers <HI>Her</HI> all manner of assi∣stance,
neverthelesse, said she unto <HI>Her,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
to give you accesse in the <HI>Princesses</HI>
house, is a thing which is not in my
power, by reason of the strict defence,
which the King hath made, not to suffer
any strangers of either sexe to see <HI>Her.</HI>
But <HI>Theocrine,</HI> who desired noting more,
then to enjoy this glory, conjures her
to breake this obstacle, and to mediate
this favour towards the <HI>King,</HI> with
whom <HI>She</HI> doubted not, but shee was
powerfull, since <HI>He</HI> had committed to
her trust that which <HI>He</HI> held most deare
in the world, the <HI>Princesse his daughter.</HI>
Being overcome by such charming in∣treaties,
shee undertakes to enforme
<HI>Meleander</HI> of this, whom <HI>She</HI> soone after
caused to yeeld, telling <HI>Him</HI> al the good
which shee could invent of this faire
<HI>Stranger.</HI> At her returne, she declares
unto <HI>Argenis,</HI> the occasion of her jour∣ney,
&amp; makes <HI>Her</HI> so favorable a report
of the beauty, comlinesse, and magnifi∣cence
of <HI>Theocrine,</HI> that <HI>She</HI> offers not
onely to receive <HI>Her</HI> as a great <HI>Princesse,</HI>
but also to love <HI>Her</HI> as <HI>Her Sister.</HI> Being
then inflamed, with a desire to see <HI>Her,
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
She</HI> commands that without any further
delay, <HI>She</HI> should be brought in, that
<HI>She</HI> might see if <HI>Her</HI> presence would
equall the glorious praises which were
giuen <HI>Her. She</HI> is then where <HI>She</HI> desires.
At this first enterview, <HI>She</HI> forgets no∣thing
of <HI>Her</HI> good behaviour, allure∣ments,
and attractive lookes, to charme
the <HI>Princesses</HI> heart, who begins to bee
but one <HI>Soule</HI> with <HI>Hers. She</HI> can so
artificially accommodate <HI>Her</HI> humour
unto that of <HI>Argenis,</HI> that in a short
time <HI>She</HI> doth purchase a full power
over <HI>Her</HI> mind, though not in the same
quality which <HI>She</HI> wished. They then,
passed away the time so sweetly toge¦ther,
that they thought they were in
Heavens glory. But <HI>Licogenes,</HI> unto whō
the remembrance of the injury, which
he thought to have received, gave him
cruell torments, raised a tempest which
troubled the calme of their de∣lights.
For, having plotted with his
friends, the meanes to revenge him∣selfe,
the resolution of this infamous
counsell was, that the <HI>Fort</HI> ought to be
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
surprised, to make away the <HI>King,</HI> and
take perforce from thence the <HI>Heire of
the Kingdome,</HI> and so put himselfe in
quiet possession of the <HI>Crowne;</HI> that, to
differre any longer, it would be the way
to ruinate their affaires, considering the
accidents which might happen. There∣fore
that hee should shew himselfe a
man, and that hee should finde in them
the succour and assistance, which hee
could hope for, of those who had a
whole interest in his trouble. There
needed not, to make use of stronger
reasons, to perswade a spirit already
imbrued with this crime.</P>
<P>It was long, since <HI>Licogenes</HI> saw with
griefe the <HI>Scepter of Sicily</HI> in the hands
of <HI>Meleander.</HI> But to bring this furious
counsell to passe, hee thought it fit to
corrupt certaine Souldiers, who should
know the entrances of this Fortresse.
He finds out one, who being conquered
by his promises, offers to fulfill his de∣sire,
so that hee procure him confede∣rates
whose courages may bee like his,
and declares unto him, that hee knew
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
the meanes to enter, by the Sea side
where there was no guard. <HI>Licogenes</HI>
glad to have found such a fit instru∣ment
for his perfidiousnesse, gives him
consorts as desperate as he, and as re∣solute
to commit a parricide. Upon a
night then, that <HI>Meleander</HI> was arrived
there, to disburden (according to <HI>His</HI>
wonted use) some part of his sorrowes
in <HI>His daughters</HI> bosome; these traitors
knew how to follow their enterprise so
well, that they entred into the <HI>Fort,</HI> and
having separated themselves in two
bands, went the one to the <HI>Kings</HI> lodg∣ings,
and the other to the <HI>Princesses.
Argenis</HI> thought on nothing else, but
sweetly to passe away the time▪ amongst
<HI>Her</HI> Ladies, and caused <HI>Selenissa</HI> and
<HI>Theocrine</HI> (whose beds were in her
chamber) to entertayne <HI>Her</HI> with a
thousand pleasant discourses: <HI>Meleander</HI>
whose age tooke away the sweetnesse
of this entertainment, had retired him∣selfe
to take rest. <HI>Argenis</HI> understan∣ding
a noise, which <HI>She</HI> was not us'd to
heare, holds up <HI>Her</HI> eyes, and seeing so
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
many armed men to enter thronging in
one after another, is frighted, and be∣gins
to cry out with feare. <HI>Her</HI> other
Ladies surprized with the like astonish∣ment,
shew no more assurance, and
for all their defence, have recourse to
their teares. But the gentle <HI>Theocrine</HI>
perceiving one, (who had advanced
himselfe first) to lay hands on the <HI>Prin∣cesse,</HI>
lets the reines loose to <HI>Her rage,</HI>
and with an extraordinary courage,
layes hold on that traytors sword,
wreathes it from him, and presently
employes it, against him from whom
<HI>She</HI> had taken it, and layes him dead in
the place. Then taking up his buckler,
<HI>She</HI> runnes upon the rest of these rascals,
whereof <HI>She</HI> cuts some part in pieces,
and causes the rest to looke out for the
doore. Another band of the conju∣rors,
had rush'd in <HI>Meleander's</HI> chamber,
whom having found asleepe in <HI>His</HI> bed,
there needed no great strength to seaze
on <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Theocrine,</HI> who had none left to fight
with, hearing the noise, which those
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
wicked rogues made about the <HI>King,</HI>
went that way, and entring in the cham∣ber,
perceived a spectacle which would
have drawne teares from a Tyger.
Those infamous <HI>Hang-men</HI> had bound
this great <HI>King</HI> with cords, and loaded
<HI>Him</HI> with chaines, who amongst so
much insolence and brutality, perceiv'd
before <HI>His</HI> eyes nought else, but the
images of despaire and horrour. The
sorrow to see the <HI>Father</HI> of <HI>Her Argenis</HI>
so unworthily abused, swells <HI>Her</HI> cou∣rage
in such sort, that without any feare
of danger where <HI>She</HI> was going to pre∣cipitate
<HI>Her selfe, She</HI> enters upon these
desperate fellowes, and having made a
cruell slaughter, amongst them, addres∣ses
<HI>Her selfe</HI> unto <HI>Meleander,</HI> and taking
away the cords and chaines, said these
few words unto <HI>Him.</HI> SIR, <HI>Those who
have committed this outrage against you,
have not kept the respect due unto</HI> Scepters,
<HI>and your vertue. But the Gods have given
me the grace to put you againe in case, to
make an exemplary punishment, of the au∣thors
of this barbarous attempt. Arme
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
your selfe, I am going to take order about
the rest of your affaires; for it is to
be feared, least those who have had the au∣dacity,
to plot so infamous a treason should
make a last attempt, to asswage their rage,
which will not be thus ended.</HI> At the in∣stant
<HI>Theocrine</HI> gives a generall allarum,
and gives notice to the Guard, of their
fault, and of the danger wherein the
<HI>King had lately beene.</HI> And as <HI>She</HI> saw
<HI>Meleander's</HI> safety to be made sure, <HI>She</HI>
came unto her <HI>Argenis,</HI> and kneeling on
the ground, us'd this language. Faire
Princesse, <HI>it is bootlesse now to dissemble,
any longer; the miracles of your beauty, have
given strength to my arme, to take revenge
for the cruell injury, which hath beene done
to the</HI> Sicilian Scepter. <HI>I am not a</HI> Lady,
<HI>as hitherto you have believed. I also esteeme,
that, what you have seene mee performe, hath
already dis-abused you. At least, it is im∣possible,
that henceforth,</HI> Meleander <HI>should
take me to be, what hee thought I was. For
feare then, least I should ruinate my designes,
instead of advancing of them, I take my
leave of you: But before I goe from the pre∣sence
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
of your faire eyes, I most humbly desire
you, by all the graces, whereof Heaven hath
so richly endowed you, to pardon mee this
offence, which is an effect of the power of
Love, unto which the Gods themselves can∣not
resist. You have prostrate at your feet,
the</HI> Heire of the Crowne of France, <HI>who
begs pardon of you. My name is</HI> Poliar∣chus,
<HI>and not</HI> Theocrine. <HI>I have borrowed
this, that I might enter where</HI> Poliarchus
<HI>could not have had accesse: I part from you
with the same sorrow, that I should part
with my life: but I hope that by my services
I shall open the way to more liberty. Pro∣nounce
my sentence, and I will take it from
you, even as the</HI> conquered, <HI>receives it from
the</HI> Conquerour.</P>
<P><HI>Argenis</HI> being, as it were, thunder∣struck,
by the freedome of these words,
finds <HI>Herselfe</HI> surprised, and at the same
instant, hath an inward combat by two
severall passions, of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Feare,</HI>
which held <HI>Her</HI> soule in agitation, in
such sort that being astonied at <HI>Theo∣crines</HI>
language, <HI>She</HI> knowes not what
answere to make <HI>Him. Feare,</HI> that this
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
action should make a spot, in <HI>Her Glory,</HI>
causes <HI>Her</HI> at first, to breath forth some
sparkles of Choler. <HI>She</HI> complaines of
this audacity, and shewes <HI>She</HI> doth not
approve those fictions, whereby <HI>She</HI>
might receive more blame, then the
Author could expect contentment. Ne∣verthelesse,
at last <HI>Love,</HI> that (so many
present victories went fortifying) bani∣shes
all those <HI>Feares,</HI> and causes <HI>Her</HI> to
finde <HI>Theocrines</HI> excuses good, to whom
at that time <HI>She</HI> doth in few words dis∣close
<HI>Her</HI> thoughts, and testifies unto
<HI>Him,</HI> that those proceedings are not dis∣pleasing
to <HI>Her,</HI> but enjoynes <HI>Him</HI> to
publish <HI>His</HI> sexe, and to make him∣selfe
knowne, to be the valiant <HI>Poliar∣chus.</HI></P>
<P>This generous <HI>Prince,</HI> who onely
sought triumphs to insinuate <HI>Himselfe</HI>
by <HI>His</HI> valour, into <HI>Argenis's</HI> favour, re∣assumes
the name of <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> and at
the same time, kissing <HI>His Mistresses</HI> faire
hands, goes out of the <HI>Fortresse</HI> and
steales away from <HI>Meleander,</HI> and <HI>His</HI>
Guard, busied in the seeking out of the
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
factious, whereof they made a horrible
slaughter. In the meane time the <HI>King</HI> is
troubled to finde out the Author of <HI>His</HI>
liberty, and as <HI>His Daughter</HI> tels <HI>Him</HI>
that <HI>He</HI> is obliged of <HI>His</HI> life, unto <HI>Theo∣crine,
He</HI> desires to see <HI>Her,</HI> that <HI>He</HI>
might give <HI>Her</HI> the praises, and recom∣pence
due to so eminent, and prodigi∣ous
a vertue. But being inform'd that
<HI>She</HI> is vanish'd, as a lightning, and that
<HI>She</HI> is not to bee found, <HI>He</HI> presently
imagines, that doubtlesse, <HI>She</HI> was no
mortall creature, but the <HI>Goddesse Pallas,</HI>
who foreseeing his misfortune, had ta∣ken
the forme of this Lady, to put by
the ruines of <HI>Sicily,</HI> which was in <HI>Her</HI>
keeping. Thereupon, even as supersti∣tion
is fertile in new devotions, <HI>He</HI> re∣volves
with himselfe, with what new
tribute of piety, <HI>He</HI> may repay, this re∣markable
good deed, which seemed to
be beyond all manner of retribution:
and wandring in <HI>His</HI> thoughts, <HI>He</HI> cau∣sed
the <HI>Chiefest</HI> of <HI>His Counsell</HI> to be as∣sembled,
unto whom speaking of this
adventure, <HI>He</HI> testified to owe <HI>His</HI> life
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
and safety, to a particular assistance of
the <HI>Divinity,</HI> rather then to any mans
succour, letting them know thereby,
that <HI>He</HI> had a designe to erect new ho∣nours
and worship, unto the <HI>Goddesse</HI>
unto whom <HI>He</HI> imagined to be indeb∣ted,
for <HI>His</HI> miraculous preservation.
Such a Religious design having beene
greatly applauded and approved by
the common voices of all the <HI>Counsell;
Meleander</HI> whose soule was already full
of these religious thoughts, and who
feared, that shewing <HI>Himselfe</HI> ungrate∣full
towards the <HI>Gods, He</HI> should oblige
them, to draw backe their blessings
from <HI>His Crowne,</HI> was easily led away
with this advice, and calling <HI>His Daugh∣ter,</HI>
opens <HI>His</HI> deliberation unto <HI>Her,</HI>
and perswades <HI>Her,</HI> so artificially, that
<HI>She</HI> freely accepted, the quality of <HI>Mi∣nervas
High Priest,</HI> in acknowledge∣ment
of the favour which <HI>She</HI> had
shewed, to <HI>Her Father</HI> and <HI>State.</HI> There
<HI>She</HI> is then wholly tyed, to the <HI>Goddesses</HI>
service, by vertue of <HI>Her</HI> new Office, now
<HI>She</HI> thinks on nothing else then the or∣dering
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of the sacrifices, and ruling of the
holy ceremonies.</P>
<P>In the meane time <HI>Lycogenes,</HI> who
knowes his crime to be unpardonable,
assembles his friends, represents unto
them, that their safety consists in ho∣ping
none, and that they must come to
an open force, since craft and artifici∣all
cunning have not succeeded. And
whereas the horror of this offence,
should have caused the armes to have
fallen from his hands, hee prepares to
give battayle unto his <HI>King.</HI> His felony
gives meanes unto the <HI>French Prince,</HI> to
cause <HI>His</HI> great courage to appeare, as∣well
under the name of <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> as it
had done, under that of <HI>Theocrine. He</HI>
had gone and presented <HI>Him elfe</HI> unto
<HI>Meleander</HI> as being newly arrived in <HI>His
Court,</HI> not making <HI>Himselfe</HI> knowne to
be <HI>Him,</HI> who had newly saved <HI>His Life</HI>
and <HI>State. He</HI> had beene received there
as a stranger, and in few dayes, had left
both to the <HI>King,</HI> and all the <HI>Court,</HI> a
great opinion of <HI>His</HI> valour. During
that time, <HI>He</HI> found the meanes often∣times,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
to see, <HI>His Argenis,</HI> amongst the
sacrifices, which were rendred unto
<HI>Minerva,</HI> for <HI>Theocrines</HI> victory. Neither
<HI>His,</HI> nor <HI>Argenis's</HI> devotion, was not so
much fixt, on the contemplation of the
ceremonies nor on the admiration of
all the pompe, as to enterchange amo∣rous
lookes, wherein lay all their feli∣city.</P>
<P>The envious army, which was alrea∣dy
in the field, troubled all this solem∣nity,
and oblig'd the <HI>King</HI> to take up
Armes, to oppose the fury of the rebels.
<HI>He</HI> had a singular confidence in <HI>Poliar∣chus
His</HI> valour, which belyed not this
hope, nor the good opinion which the
world had conceived of the greatnesse
of <HI>His</HI> courage. The two Armies being
in sight, <HI>He</HI> began the fight, and as a
mighty war-like thunder, unto which
nothing can resist, did so much by the
wonders of <HI>His</HI> sword, that <HI>Meleander</HI>
won a glorious victory, and put the re∣bels
out of hopes, to attempt any more,
the hazzard of Combats. Dispaire made
them seeke after peace; they have per∣mission,
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
to send their <HI>Deputies</HI> in <HI>Court,</HI>
to make the overture of some treaty.
<HI>Poliarchus,</HI> who could not live in rest, at
the first newes of this peace, which <HI>He</HI>
did not approve, not believing, that
the <HI>King</HI> ought to trust to <HI>Traytors;</HI> re∣solved
to goe elsewhere, to finde out
new occasions of <HI>Glory.</HI> Having then
left the <HI>Court,</HI> and traversing a great
forest, having no other thoughts then
on <HI>His Argenis,</HI> which filled all <HI>His</HI> spi∣rits;
<HI>Hee</HI> meets those whom <HI>Licogenes</HI>
sent unto <HI>Meleander,</HI> rather ecquipped
like <HI>Cavaleers,</HI> or to speake the truth
like <HI>Robbers,</HI> then <HI>Ambassadours.</HI> They
immediately knew <HI>Him</HI> for the Author
of their misfortune, and enraged, with
fury, resolve to revenge on <HI>Him</HI> the
affront, which <HI>His</HI> valour caused them
to receive. At the same time, they set
on <HI>Him,</HI> and make it appeare, that they
would bereave <HI>Him</HI> of <HI>His</HI> life. But <HI>He,</HI>
who could feare nothing, not being
astonied, at their threates, makes them
feele the effects of <HI>His</HI> courage, over∣throwes
two, dead upon the place,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
scatters the others, and puts them to
flight. Those that could escape, goe and
fill the <HI>Court</HI> with their complaints, and
aggravate this outrage, done unto <HI>Am∣bassadors,</HI>
whose persons are held for <HI>sa∣cred,</HI>
yea amongst the <HI>Barbarous.</HI> They
demand Justice which cannot be denied
them, because the <HI>Court</HI> hath no know∣ledge
of their crime, nor of the inno∣cence,
of <HI>Him,</HI> whom they accused. It
is true, that <HI>Meleander</HI> could not ima∣gine,
that so notorious a villany, could
have entred, in so noble a courage, and
besides all that, that which came
from <HI>Licogenes'es</HI> party was to bee
suspected, also the Souldiers whol∣ly
affected to <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> who in their
sight, had done so many wonders
in the <HI>Field,</HI> did openly jeere at this ac∣cusation,
which, in what kind soever, it
could be interpreted; could not, but
turne, to the shame of those, who made
it, since they accused, one man alone, to
have beaten five, well armed, and in
case to defend themselves. But, the
conjurors faction, was so puissant, in
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
<HI>Court;</HI> that, at last, it obtained that <HI>Poli∣archus,</HI>
should be condemned, and to be
destined, to serve for a sacrifice, unto
the <HI>Kings</HI> enemyes fury, who in defen∣ding
of <HI>Him,</HI> might have caused a sus∣pition,
amongst those diffident spirits,
that <HI>He</HI> had done nothing, but by <HI>His</HI>
authority. Order is then given every
where to take <HI>Him,</HI> and also, the Com∣mons
are armed, to the end, that all
meanes of escaping, might bee taken
away.</P>
<P>In the meane time, it hapned during
the fight, that, <HI>Archombrotus Prince of
Mauritania,</HI> who was also searching out
adventures, under a disguised habit,
was by chance, neere the place, where
the combat was given. <HI>He</HI> was newly
landed, (having beene beaten with sun∣dry
tempests at sea) neere unto that
great and thicke Forest, where <HI>He</HI> was
gone, thinking to take some rest under
the shade of some trees, being wearied
of the sea. But the vertuons <HI>Timoclea,</HI>
who had seen the furious outrage, done
to the <HI>Prince of France,</HI> came unto <HI>Him</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>
weeping and waking <HI>Him,</HI> conjured
<HI>Him,</HI> that if <HI>He</HI> would doe an action,
worthy the generosity which appeared
in <HI>His</HI> visage, that without any further
delay, <HI>He</HI> should goe and succour the
most valiant man in the world, that
<HI>Robbers</HI> endeavoured to murther. Ope∣ning
<HI>His</HI> eyes, <HI>He</HI> searches for <HI>His</HI> Ar∣mour
confusedly, and preparing <HI>Him∣selfe,</HI>
at all adventures, endeavours to
put <HI>Himselfe</HI> in case to fight. <HI>Timoclea</HI>
fearing, least the number, might op∣presse
valour, urges <HI>Him</HI> to advance,
and represents unto <HI>Him</HI> the necessity,
and danger, wherein <HI>Poliarchus</HI> finds
<HI>Himselfe. He</HI> who was enflamed with
desire, to have <HI>His</HI> courage to appeare,
in so faire an occasion, without further
delay, spurres <HI>His</HI> Horse towards the
place of the combat. But <HI>He</HI> sees, with
some kind of sorrow, that <HI>He</HI> arrives too
late, and that <HI>He,</HI> whom <HI>He</HI> is desirous
to succour, hath needed no other assi∣stance,
then that, of <HI>His</HI> sword. Ravish'd
with this wonder, <HI>He</HI> doth accost <HI>Him,</HI>
and having courteously saluted <HI>Him,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>
informes <HI>Himselfe</HI> of the particulars of
this encounter, offers to assist <HI>Him,</HI> in
case there remaines any enemy, to fight
with, and conjures <HI>Him,</HI> to honour <HI>Him</HI>
so much, as to imploy <HI>Him</HI> in this quar∣rell.
<HI>Poliarchus</HI> resting extreamely sa∣tisfied
of the <HI>Prince of Mauritania's</HI> good
behaviour, and courtesy, thanks <HI>Him</HI> for
this freedome, and assures <HI>Him</HI> of the
esteeme <HI>Hee</HI> makes of <HI>His</HI> courage, not
refusing to make use of it, in case, <HI>His</HI>
affaires oblige <HI>Him</HI> thereunto. But,
<HI>Gentle Cavaleere,</HI> said <HI>He,</HI> I know neither
those, who have so cowardly assaulted
<HI>me,</HI> nor the reason of the furious hatred,
which they beare me. <HI>Timoclea</HI> arriving
thereupon with some of <HI>Poliarchus His</HI>
servants, breakes off the two <HI>Princes</HI>
discourse, and taking the word conjures
them, to goe out of this Forest, and fol∣low
her, to a house which shee hath,
neere unto that place, where they might
learne the true causes of this encoun∣ter.
They went then altogether with
<HI>Timoclea,</HI> where they are hardly arrived,
when the Shepheards of the Country,
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>
come to give them notice, that all the
champion, is full of kindled fires, every
where, and that doubtlesse, there is
some accident fallen out at <HI>Court;</HI> seeing
that was never done, but upon great
and important occasions. And that <HI>He</HI>
might take no rest, news were brought,
that <HI>Poliarchus</HI> was the subject of all
this emotion, to which they adde that
upon the <HI>Ambassadours</HI> complaint, <HI>He</HI>
hath beene condemned in <HI>Court. Poli∣archus</HI>
seeing that 'tis <HI>He,</HI> whom this
tempest threatens, breathes forth all
manner of outrages against <HI>Meleander,</HI>
doth reproach <HI>His</HI> services, complaines
of <HI>His</HI> ungratitude, accuses also the in∣nocent
Starres, as if they were the cause
of <HI>His</HI> mis-fortune. <HI>Timoclea</HI> fearing
least <HI>He</HI> (unto whom all <HI>Sicily</HI> owed their
safety) should fall in the hands of those
<HI>Traitors,</HI> that they should advance <HI>His</HI>
ruine, by their artificiall deceits opens
<HI>Him</HI> the way, how to shade <HI>Himselfe,</HI>
against this tempest, shewes <HI>Him</HI> at the
going out of a closet, of <HI>Her</HI> house, a
long Vault, which went under ground,
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>
whereof the avenewes, were knowne to
few, and conjures <HI>Him</HI> to make use of
this opportunity, not onely to steale
away, from the eyes of those, who
sought <HI>Him,</HI> but also to goe out of <HI>Sicily</HI>
under the favour of a borrowed visage,
wherewith she could so artificially dis∣guise
<HI>Him,</HI> that <HI>His</HI> most intimate
friends, would hardly take <HI>Him</HI> to bee
<HI>Poliarchus.</HI> At last, <HI>He</HI> is overcome
with her perswasions, makes use of the
opportunity, which she presents unto
<HI>Him,</HI> and though unwilling, confines
<HI>Himselfe</HI> within this Vault, (untill he can
give some order for <HI>His</HI> retreate) where
<HI>Timoclea,</HI> and the <HI>Prince of Mauritania,</HI>
would needs conduct <HI>Him,</HI> daring not
to trust those of the houshold, whose
faith they suspected; having left <HI>Him</HI> in
this cave, and being come backe to the
house, <HI>Timoclea</HI> began to entertaine her
guesse, with the best and most civill dis∣courses
which she could invent. In the
meane time <HI>Timoclea</HI> and <HI>Archombrotus,</HI>
thinking to assure <HI>Poliarchus His</HI> life, did
almost ruinate <HI>His</HI> affaires. To take
<PB N="28" REF="23"/>
away all suspition, they bethought thē∣selves,
to cause a rumor of <HI>His</HI> death, to
be spread abroad, and that none might
doubt of it, caused <HI>His</HI> servants to be
seene, weeping the losse of their <HI>Ma∣ster,</HI>
&amp; they also shewed sad testimonies
of their sorrow. This rumor did fly as
farre as <HI>Argenis's</HI> eares, who would not
survive <HI>Him,</HI> having as <HI>She</HI> thought, lost
<HI>Him,</HI> who made <HI>Her</HI> take all the delight
<HI>She</HI> had in the world. <HI>Selenissa</HI> brake this
designe, by her wisedome, shewing unto
<HI>Her</HI> that <HI>She</HI> ought not so slightly to
give faith to a rumor, who had no
assured Authour. That asswaged some∣thing
<HI>Her</HI> griefe, but did not altogether
heale the sore. <HI>Her</HI> thoughts were then
tossed, with irk some cares, which altred
by little and little the beauty of <HI>Her</HI>
face. Also <HI>Meleander</HI> being come to en∣tertaine
<HI>Her,</HI> with <HI>His</HI> affaires, though
<HI>She</HI> had resolved, to oppose <HI>Her</HI> con∣stancy,
to <HI>Her</HI> mis-fortunes, and to sup∣presse
<HI>Her</HI> sorrowes, for feare, that <HI>Her</HI>
Love should be knowne, neverthelesse
when <HI>He</HI> began the discourse, of <HI>Poliar∣chus
<PB N="29" REF="23"/>
His</HI> accident, and to tell <HI>Her</HI> how <HI>He</HI>
had bin constrained, to abandon <HI>Him,</HI> to
<HI>His</HI> enemies rage, <HI>She</HI> could be no lon∣ger
mistris of <HI>Her</HI> senses, but fell downe
in a trance, at the recitall of this adven∣ture.
<HI>Selenissa</HI> smothered this accident,
in the best wise she could, and assured
the <HI>King,</HI> that <HI>She</HI> had had sundry such
fits lately, but that she believed, there
was nothing to be feared, and that they
were but little faintings, caused with
the displeasure, which <HI>She</HI> had suffered
during <HI>Licogenes</HI> his warre; <HI>Her Father</HI>
left <HI>Her,</HI> amongst <HI>Her</HI> Women, who,
with the severall remedies they gave
<HI>Her,</HI> made <HI>Her</HI> come to <HI>Her selfe</HI> againe.
But <HI>She</HI> received a full cure, by the
newes which were brought unto <HI>Her,</HI>
few daies after of <HI>Her Poliarchus,</HI> by an
intimate friend of <HI>His,</HI> named <HI>Arsidas.</HI>
This trusty confident had learn'd by
<HI>Gelanore,</HI> a domesticke servant unto <HI>Po∣liarchus,</HI>
the truth of <HI>His</HI> History, there∣upon
he came to finde <HI>Him</HI> out in <HI>Timo∣cleas</HI>
house, where having had confe∣rence
(of all <HI>His</HI> affaires) with <HI>Him, Po∣liarchus</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="24"/>
conjured him, to see <HI>His Faire
Argenis,</HI> in <HI>His</HI> name, and to know of
<HI>Her,</HI> as of <HI>His</HI> Oracle, what <HI>He</HI> should
doe, in this extremity; <HI>He</HI> knew to what
end the rumor of <HI>His</HI> death had beene
spread; <HI>He</HI> had also had notice, with
what violence the Commons (to shew
themselves passionate for the <HI>Kings</HI> ser∣vice,)
pursued <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> seeing, that
being perswaded, <HI>He</HI> was in <HI>Timocleas</HI>
house, had runne thither, and without
any respect, had violently entred in 't,
to take and make <HI>Him</HI> prisoner. In
which, having had no successe, because
<HI>Poliarchus</HI> was in a place of safety. They
neverthelesse, discharged their choller,
upon <HI>His Fellow the Prince of Mauritania,</HI>
who was, at last, constrained, to suffer
<HI>Himselfe</HI> to be led captive, unto <HI>Melean∣der,</HI>
as if it had beene <HI>He</HI> whom they
sought after. <HI>Arsidas</HI> then, who had
seene all these violences, came to give
<HI>Argenis</HI> notice of the state of <HI>Her Poliar∣chus
His</HI> affaires. At these pleasing news
<HI>She</HI> was as much troubled to keepe
backe <HI>Her</HI> soule, and to hinder it, from
<PB N="31" REF="24"/>
leaving the body, as <HI>She</HI> had beene, in
the excesse of <HI>Her</HI> griefe. But Joy setled
<HI>Her</HI> minde againe; insomuch that the
rayes of this <HI>Sunne</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI> began
to appeare againe. During which time,
newes were brought unto <HI>Her,</HI> that <HI>Po∣liarchus</HI>
was led as a prisoner unto the
<HI>Court:</HI> But the intelligence, which <HI>She</HI>
had received, by <HI>Arsidas</HI> of <HI>Archombrotus</HI>
accident, hindred this ill rumor, from
making an impression, upon <HI>Her</HI> spirit.
So that this cloud was soone over. As
the Commons, which had taken him,
were arrived at <HI>Court,</HI> one of the <HI>Cap∣taines
of the Guard,</HI> seeing so faire a pri∣soner,
in the hands of rusticall men,
ask'd of him who conducted <HI>Him,</HI>
what that <HI>Cavalleere</HI> had done, whom
they us'd so rigorously. This <HI>Head</HI> of
the common people, having replyed,
that it was <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> whom the <HI>King</HI>
had commanded, should be taken, that
<HI>He</HI> might be punish'd, according to ju∣stice;
He began to smile, and said unto
this people, that to speake the truth,
they had shewed their fidelity, for the
<PB N="32" REF="25"/>
<HI>Kings</HI> service, but that they had not
sped, in this occasion, seeing their priso∣ner,
was not <HI>Poliarchus</HI> which was sought
for. Neverthelesse, <HI>He</HI> was led before
<HI>Meleander,</HI> who, after <HI>He</HI> had praised
<HI>His</HI> subjects zeale, address'd <HI>Himselfe</HI>
unto <HI>Arcombrotus,</HI> and made <HI>Him</HI> a
thousand excuses, for this offence hap∣pened
not by <HI>His</HI> command▪ but by the
ignorance, of this people, who had mis∣taken
themselves, in <HI>His</HI> person. The
<HI>Prince of Mauritania,</HI> though full of rage,
to see <HI>Himselfe</HI> so unworthily abused,
neverthelesse dissembled <HI>His</HI> choler, &amp;
making <HI>His</HI> complement, with a very
comely behaviour, most humbly desired
<HI>Him</HI> to believe, that in what manner
soever, <HI>He</HI> could bee brought before
<HI>Him, He</HI> held it alwaies for a singular
glory, that <HI>He</HI> had the meanes, to offer
<HI>Him His</HI> service. In fine, neverthelesse,
shewing <HI>Himselfe</HI> more sensible of
the injury done to <HI>His</HI> friend, then
to <HI>Himselfe, He</HI> could not hinder <HI>Him∣selfe</HI>
from representing his complaint,
and said with a haughty courage unto
<PB N="33" REF="25"/>
<HI>Meleander. But, concerning</HI> Poliarchus
His <HI>disgrace, which hath beene the subject
of my mis-fortune;</HI> Your Majesty, <HI>will give
me leave to tell</HI> Him, <HI>that if accusations
make crimes, there will bee no innocence,
assured in the world, since, that the most
just, will by this meanes be exposed, unto
the rage of slander, which is perpetually,
about</HI> Princes <HI>eares, to surprise and give
them all manner of ill impressions, against
those which they would put out of favour.</HI>
Your Majesty <HI>may be pleased to remember</HI>
Licogenes <HI>his brazen face, and the inso∣lency,
of all his confederates? Doe not</HI> You
<HI>imagine also, that those who have made such
an outrage, against the</HI> Crowne, <HI>will spare</HI>
Your <HI>best Servants? Those who conspire
against</HI> Kings, <HI>and that will have their</HI>
Empires, <HI>to grow desolate, doe first endea∣vour,
to corrupt and seduce those whom
they know to bee most passionate for their
service, and when they cannot doe it, make
use of other crafts, to cause their</HI> Masters
<HI>to suspect their fidelity, to the end that da∣ring
not to trust them any more, they should
remaine wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sefull unto them, I have
<PB N="34" REF="26"/>
learn'd of a</HI> Lady <HI>of this</HI> Court (<HI>who by
chance was in company with that</HI> Cavalleer,
<HI>when I first saw</HI> Him,) <HI>the great assistance
which</HI> He <HI>hath given</HI> You, <HI>in the Warre,
that those seditions have most unhappily
kindled in the middest of</HI> Your Kingdome,
<HI>and the hurt which</HI> He <HI>hath done to</HI> Your
<HI>enemies. The griefe which they have con∣ceived
thereat hath caused them, to seeke
out the meanes to make</HI> Him <HI>away, by open
violence, that they might rob</HI> You <HI>of that
powerfull prop, of</HI> Your State. <HI>But this
designe having fayled, by the great valour
that was in</HI> Him <HI>whom these cowards as∣saulted;
They now have had recourse unto
vayled artificiall deceits. And to circum∣vent</HI>
Your <HI>goodnesse, doe father upon an
innocent, the odiousnesse of an action, where
there's no crime, but that which proceeds
from their perfidiousnesse.</HI> Your Majesty
<HI>who hath purchas'd so much glory, by the
true execution of</HI> Justice, <HI>not onely amongst</HI>
His <HI>subjects, but also amongst strangers,
will reserve, if</HI> He <HI>pleases, an eare for</HI> Poli∣archus,
<HI>to learne by</HI> His <HI>owne mouth, the
particulars of this encounter, which trou∣bles
<PB N="35" REF="26"/>
all</HI> Your Court, <HI>and may be pleased to
remember, that though</HI> He <HI>were guilty, it
would alwaies bee a kinde of injustice, to
condemne</HI> Him, <HI>and not heare</HI> His <HI>reasons.
And if</HI> Your Majesty <HI>will grant, that I
may finde out the truth of this businesse by
those meanes, which are used amongst</HI> Ca∣valleers,
<HI>I offer my selfe to enter in com∣bate
against the authors of this slaunder. I
am sure that having the</HI> Gods, (<HI>whom they
have offended,) for their enemies, and that
having a continuall remorse, in their consci∣ences,
their armes will fall from their hands,
and that their cowardise will bee a visible
proofe, of the infamous treason, whereof they
have beene the inventors.</HI> The <HI>King,</HI> who
was a generous <HI>Prince,</HI> was not offen∣ded
at <HI>Archombrotus His</HI> freedome, but
by the mildnesse of <HI>His</HI> face and spee∣ches,
testified altogether the beliefe <HI>He</HI>
had of <HI>Poliarchus His</HI> innocence, and
the esteeme <HI>He</HI> made of <HI>His</HI> friends
great courage, who offered <HI>Himselfe</HI> so
freely to fight, in the behalf of <HI>His</HI> cause.
All the <HI>Court</HI> made acclamations of joy,
at this lofty testimony, which the <HI>Prince
<PB N="36" REF="27"/>
of Mauritania</HI> rendred unto <HI>Poliarchus.
Argenis</HI> who tooke the best part there∣in,
thank'd him, with much curtesie, and
by this civility, did put <HI>Herselfe</HI> in dan∣ger
to spoile all, seeing that <HI>Archombro∣tus</HI>
who had nothing of the <HI>Moore</HI> but
the name, being kept backe, in <HI>Her Fa∣thers</HI>
service, and having gotten the re∣putation
of the most valiant <HI>Cavalleere</HI>
in the world, after <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> was sur∣prised
with vanity, which made <HI>Him</HI> so
farre to forget, all <HI>His</HI> promises, that <HI>He</HI>
became <HI>His</HI> friends Rivall, and endea∣voured
to rob <HI>Him</HI> of the <HI>Princesse.</HI> In the
meane time <HI>Argenis,</HI> sends a dispatch
by <HI>Arsidas</HI> to <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> conjures <HI>Him</HI>
by <HI>Her</HI> letters, to believe that all these
crosses of fortune, were usefull onely, to
encrease <HI>Her</HI> love, rather then to dimi∣nish
it, that <HI>Argenis</HI> will never be to any,
but to <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> that <HI>She</HI> passionatly
desired <HI>She</HI> might assure <HI>Him</HI> thereof,
with <HI>Her</HI> owne mouth but that <HI>She</HI>
feares, least comming to <HI>Court He</HI>
should be knowen; therefore let <HI>him</HI>
take the surest party, and if <HI>He</HI> thinkes
<PB N="37" REF="27"/>
it fit, <HI>He</HI> should returne in <HI>His Kingdome:</HI>
But that <HI>He</HI> should not forget, to cause
<HI>His</HI> greatnesse to appeare, by bringing
so faire an army, from <HI>His Countrey,</HI> that
among'st the obstacles, which might
oppose themselves to <HI>their</HI> designe, <HI>He</HI>
should be able to free <HI>Her</HI> from those
cares and troubles, which <HI>Their</HI> separa∣tion
causes, that in the meane time, <HI>Shee</HI>
will indeavor, to change <HI>Her Fathers</HI> an∣ger
and bring <HI>Him</HI> againe, in <HI>His</HI> favour.
Which <HI>She</HI> imagines will not be very
difficult, considering the esteeme which
<HI>He</HI> makes, of <HI>His</HI> vertue. <HI>Poliarchus</HI> ha∣ving
read this letter, could not tell
what to resolve. The imagination, of
the perill and feare to be discovered,
caus'd <HI>Him</HI> to apprehend the journey to
<HI>Court,</HI> where he doubted not, but <HI>His</HI> e∣nemies,
were watching to surprise <HI>Him.
Arsidas</HI> and <HI>Timoclea</HI> fearing, least▪ <HI>He</HI>
should miscarry, represented <HI>Him</HI> the
danger, yet greater then it was. But the
desire <HI>He</HI> had to see <HI>Argenis,</HI> made <HI>Him</HI>
despise all the hazzards, which they re∣presented.
<HI>He</HI> then calls aside, <HI>His</HI> deare
<PB N="38" REF="28"/>
friend, and declares unto <HI>Him,</HI> that <HI>He</HI>
had rather expose <HI>Himselfe</HI> to <HI>His</HI> ene∣mies
rage, then to goe out of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and
not see the <HI>Princesse. Arsidas</HI> seeing the
ardour of <HI>His</HI> passion, in lieu of oppo∣sing,
fortifies it, by the assurance which
he gives <HI>Him,</HI> to runne the same hazard.
They take leave of <HI>Timoclea,</HI> unto whō
<HI>Poliarchus</HI> protested, to be so much obli∣ged,
that it is out of <HI>His</HI> power, to ac∣knowledge
the innumerable courtesies,
which she hath heap'd upon <HI>Him;</HI> con∣jures
her to believe, that at least, she hath
a <HI>Crowne</HI> and a <HI>King</HI> at her devotion;
assures her, that <HI>Hee</HI> will returne into
<HI>Sicily,</HI> so well accompanied, that the
greatnesse of <HI>His</HI> birth, shall not bee
doubted, and that then, <HI>He</HI> shall have
some manner of meanes, to acknow∣ledge
the good offices, which <HI>His</HI> trusty
friends have done him; and then addes,
that <HI>He</HI> is going to make use, of the per∣riwigge,
and beard (whereof she had
made <HI>Him</HI> a present) to disguise <HI>Him∣selfe.</HI>
Thus with an extreame sorrow <HI>He</HI>
takes <HI>His</HI> leave of this vertuous <HI>Lady,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="28"/>
which did shed, an Ocean of teares at
<HI>His</HI> departure <HI>He</HI> soone after arrived
at <HI>Court,</HI> with <HI>Arsidas His</HI> Conduct,
where immediately after, <HI>He</HI> gives no∣tice
unto <HI>Argenis</HI> of <HI>His</HI> coming, the joy
which <HI>She</HI> received thereat, cannot be
exprest; but seeing <HI>Him,</HI> with a forme,
so different, from that of <HI>Poliarchus, She</HI>
did shed some teares, seeing in what
danger, <HI>He</HI> did precipitate <HI>Himselfe</HI> for
<HI>Her</HI> sake: on the other side, the content∣ment
which <HI>She</HI> received, to see before
<HI>Her</HI> eyes, that which <HI>She</HI> held most
deare in the world, caused <HI>Her,</HI> pre∣sently
to leave off <HI>Her</HI> teares. It was in
the <HI>Temple,</HI> in the middest of the devoti∣ons
and sacrifices, where they saw each
other, but it was impossible to continue
this practice, full of danger, any longer;
<HI>Argenis</HI> sent <HI>Him</HI> word by <HI>Arsidas</HI> that
<HI>Hee</HI> should with expedition saile into
<HI>France,</HI> to raise there, with promptitude,
an army able, not onely, to overcome
the <HI>Kings</HI> enemies, but also all <HI>Sicily.
Arsidas</HI> undertooke to fraight a ship, for
that voyage, under colour that he had
<PB N="40" REF="29"/>
another to make in <HI>Italy.</HI> They im∣barque
themselves, intending to hold
their course towards <HI>France,</HI> but the fates
disposed otherwise of it.</P>
<P>In the meane time, the Warre is kind∣led
afresh, and the <HI>Confederates,</HI> having
reunited their forces, caused all the
<HI>State,</HI> to rebell against the <HI>King,</HI> who
had but foure <HI>Holds</HI> remayning, in one
of which (being scituat in an Island) <HI>He</HI>
retired <HI>Himselfe</HI> with <HI>Argenis,</HI> and the
choyce of his trustiest Servants. In this
distresse, Fortune brought forth new
causes of trouble, unto <HI>Poliarchus</HI> and
the <HI>Princesse.</HI> The yong <HI>King of Sardany
and Corse,</HI> taken with <HI>Argenis's</HI> beauty,
whereof the glory as well as the pi∣ctures
had flowen, throughout all the
Universe, makes a puissant Army, takes
<HI>His</HI> course towards <HI>Sicily,</HI> and arrives
with <HI>His</HI> Navy, neere unto the <HI>Towne</HI>
where <HI>Meleander</HI> had retired <HI>Himselfe.</HI>
The sight of so many Sayles, frights all
the <HI>Kings</HI> party, as if they had beene
new enemies, arrived to dissipate the
relickes of <HI>His</HI> fortune. But the <HI>King
<PB N="41" REF="29"/>
of Sardany,</HI> sends to <HI>Meleander,</HI> gives <HI>Him</HI>
assurance of <HI>His</HI> Army, and declares
<HI>Him,</HI> that taking that interest which <HI>He</HI>
ought, in the common case of <HI>Kings, He</HI>
was come to assist <HI>Him,</HI> and to helpe
<HI>Him</HI> to chastise <HI>His</HI> subjects rebellion.
This new joy, causes <HI>Him</HI> to open <HI>His</HI>
Gates, and the <HI>King Himselfe</HI> prepares to
goe, and receive <HI>Him,</HI> in <HI>His</HI> owne ship∣ping.
But being desirous to take away
all suspition unto <HI>Meleander,</HI> and <HI>His;
He</HI> commands <HI>His</HI> Navy to remaine in
the roade, till they had newes of <HI>Him,</HI>
and with a small traine, goes to meete
with <HI>Meleander,</HI> who with a great free∣dome
leapes into <HI>His</HI> Ship, to honour
<HI>Him</HI> so much the more. After the com∣plements,
the <HI>King of Sardany,</HI> to wit∣nesse,
that <HI>He</HI> had no lesse confidence,
then that of <HI>Sicily,</HI> goes in <HI>His</HI> Gally, and
went in company together towards the
Towne, where <HI>Meleander</HI> receives <HI>Him,</HI>
with as much magnificence, as the state
of <HI>His</HI> affaires would permit. Having
courted a while, <HI>He</HI> hastens the warre,
and being enflamed with the love of
<PB N="42" REF="30"/>
<HI>Argenis,</HI> whom <HI>He</HI> had found much fai∣rer,
then <HI>Her</HI> picture, wishes for nought
else, but Combats, desiring to make
<HI>Himselfe</HI> remarkeable in them, to shew
<HI>Himselfe</HI> worthy of the love of so faire a
<HI>Princesse. Archombrotus</HI> is jealous of this
new Rivall, doth protest in <HI>His</HI> heart,
<HI>He</HI> will never yeeld <HI>Him</HI> this glory,
which <HI>He</HI> could not suffer that it should
be enjoyed by another, which was bet∣ter
then <HI>He,</HI> who was <HI>Poliarchus.</HI> These
yong <HI>Cavalleers,</HI> edg'd on by their passi∣ons,
doe wonders against the enemies.
But the <HI>Moore,</HI> was so happy, that having
saved <HI>Meleanders</HI> life, <HI>He,</HI> with <HI>His</HI> owne
hand, slew the chiefe of the factious;
Neverthelesse, the forces which the
<HI>King of Sardany</HI> had brought, which
doubtlesse had opened the way unto
the Victory, seemed exceeding conside∣rable
unto the <HI>King and Court of Sicily.</HI>
Being all returned in the place where
<HI>Faire Argenis</HI> was, the onely subject of
so many heroicall actions, jealousie in∣flames
it selfe; the <HI>Moore,</HI> (though co∣vertly)
imployes all his industry, to
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>
chase the <HI>Princesses</HI> favour, who hath
<HI>His</HI> sollicitations in disdaine, and de∣tests
in <HI>Her</HI> heart, so visible an infidelity,
which tends onely, to make a shamefull
wound in <HI>Her</HI> constancy. <HI>The King of
Sardany</HI> asketh <HI>Her</HI> in marriage openly
unto <HI>Her Father,</HI> who dares not refuse
<HI>Her,</HI> after so powerfull a succour where∣with
<HI>He</HI> hath newly oblig'd <HI>Him.</HI> Ne∣verthelesse
knowing that <HI>His Daughter,</HI>
had no inclination, for that <HI>Prince, He</HI>
makes use of all manner of artificiall
delayes, to feede <HI>Him</HI> with vaine hopes,
without breaking with <HI>Him,</HI> fearing
least being moved with <HI>His</HI> refusall, <HI>He</HI>
should turne <HI>His</HI> armes against <HI>Sicily.</HI>
But where art thou <HI>Poliarchus?</HI></P>
<P>Some few months before, <HI>He</HI> had
shipp'd himselfe in that Vessell, which,
<HI>Arsidas</HI> had caused, to be prepar'd, to
sayle towards the <HI>Gaules:</HI> but <HI>He</HI> was
beaten, with such contrary winds, and
<HI>His</HI> Ship was so much persecuted, with
tempestuous stormes, that <HI>He</HI> was con∣strain'd,
to abandon it, and put <HI>Himselfe,</HI>
under the mercy of the waves in a little
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>
Cock-boat, which went and split it self,
neere unto a rock, where, with much
trouble <HI>He</HI> saved <HI>Himselfe,</HI> with <HI>His</HI>
trusty <HI>Gelanore:</HI> But it was not the end
of <HI>His</HI> adventures. Perceaving from the
top of this clift, a Brigantine which say∣led
upon the sea, <HI>He</HI> began to call out,
and to conjure, those which were with∣in
it, that they should take pitty at <HI>His</HI>
misfortune: They were <HI>Pyrates,</HI> who
had no feeling of humanity: Neverthe∣lesse
imagining that those who call'd
them, had saved some great riches,
among'st the relickes of their Ship∣wrack,
they came neere the Rock, and
tooke them in their Brigantine. <HI>Poliar∣chus
His</HI> port, and the sumptuous
cloathes, wherewith <HI>He</HI> and <HI>Gelanore</HI>
were clad, was like to be their vndo∣ing:
The Captaine with his consorts,
would have put them to the Chayne.
<HI>Poliarchus,</HI> astonied at this barbarous∣nesse,
retires a step backwards, and put∣ting
<HI>His</HI> hand upon <HI>His</HI> sword, askes
<HI>Him</HI> whence came this change, having
newly saved <HI>His</HI> life? Desires him, not
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>
to blot so great an obligation, by so
bloody an outrage. But <HI>He</HI> speakes to a
barbarous man, to whom intreaties en∣venom
and swell the courage. <HI>Poliarchus</HI>
who would dispute <HI>His</HI> liberty, takes
hold on a peece of an oare, whereof
<HI>He</HI> makes use in lieu of a buckler, and
drawing <HI>His</HI> sword, shewes that <HI>He</HI> is
not a man, to suffer that affront; <HI>Gela∣nore</HI>
seconds <HI>Him:</HI> They fight, but the
match was so vnequall, that the <HI>Prince</HI>
had infallibly bin lost, if some prisoners
(unto whom <HI>He</HI> had the dexterity to
cut their bonds wherewith they were
tyed, arming themselves, with the Py∣rates
owne armes, which they had
slayne) had not succor'd them. At last
this assistance made <HI>Him</HI> victorious, and
master of the Brigantine, and fortune of
those which were within it. <HI>He</HI> learn't
by the Galli-slaves, and prisoners, that
those Pyrates, had newly taken a great
prey, in <HI>Mauritania,</HI> and that they had
carried away, all the <HI>Queenes</HI> Treasure,
who had an vncomfortable sorrow
thereof. One of them, to whom <HI>Poliar∣chus</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>
had saved the life, told <HI>Him</HI> all the
particulars thereof, and also shewed
<HI>Him,</HI> the place where the Boxes were
hidden. <HI>Poliarchus</HI> having caused them
all to be opened; was astonied, at the
sight of so much riches, together, and
then thought it fit, that being so neere
unto the <HI>Queenes</HI> Territories, <HI>He</HI> was, (in
Honor) obliged, to seeke <HI>Her</HI> out, and
to restore unto <HI>Her Her</HI> Treasure, to free
<HI>Her</HI> from the affliction wherein this
losse had plunged <HI>Her.</HI> But as they were
throwing the dead over-boord, <HI>He</HI> per∣ceaved,
that <HI>His</HI> folkes were searching
one, upon the sands, of whom having
pulled off one of his buskins; they
found a packet of letters very carefully
bound up upon his legge. Curiosity,
made <HI>Him</HI> desire to see what it was; <HI>He</HI>
perceaves presently, that the letters
were directed unto <HI>Him,</HI> and having
opened them, sees the name of <HI>Licoge∣nes,</HI>
which was he who writ unto <HI>Him.</HI>
The little love they bare one to another
made <HI>Him</HI> admire this novelty: But ha∣ving
read them exactly, <HI>He</HI> was strucke
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>
with an incomparable astonishment,
greater then the first, wherein <HI>He</HI> had
found <HI>Himselfe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Licogenes</HI> having had notice that <HI>Ar∣genis</HI>
had made <HI>Poliarchus His</HI> peace
with <HI>Meleander;</HI> and that <HI>Meleander,</HI> to
assure <HI>Him</HI> of <HI>His</HI> good will, did not
onely write unto <HI>Him,</HI> but also sent <HI>Him</HI>
a rich Bracelet, in token of <HI>His</HI> affecti∣on;
had found the meanes, to cause
this present, to be poison'd, by the arti∣ficiall
cunning of one of his confidents;
and to cause the horror of his crime to
fall on <HI>Meleander,</HI> had sent him who was
found amongst the dead in this ship, to
the end he might give notice unto <HI>Poli∣archus,</HI>
of the treason, which was inten∣ded
towards <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Poliarchus</HI> having seene by <HI>Licogenes
His</HI> letters, the advice which <HI>He</HI> gave
<HI>Him,</HI> could never imagine that <HI>He</HI> had
so much care of <HI>His</HI> life, nor that a great
<HI>King</HI> would have procured <HI>Him</HI> such an
infamous death. <HI>He</HI> puts off the deli∣beration
of the businesse; till <HI>Hee</HI> was
arrived in <HI>Mauritania,</HI> where at the in∣stant
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>
he caused the Brigantine to saile;
<HI>He</HI> sent <HI>His Gelanore</HI> before, to advertise
the Queene of <HI>His</HI> arrivall, and to as∣sure
<HI>Her</HI> that <HI>He</HI> brought backe <HI>Her</HI>
Treasure which <HI>He</HI> had taken from the
hands of the Pyrates. These newes re∣joyc'd
the <HI>Affricans,</HI> but the <HI>Queene</HI> could
not imagine that <HI>Her</HI> Treasure was yet
whole; and there was something in it,
when it was taken, which troubled <HI>Her</HI>
more then all the rest. <HI>She</HI> takes what
was next to <HI>Her,</HI> and goes to the Sea∣shore,
to welcome <HI>Poliarchus.</HI> At their
meeting, <HI>He</HI> salutes <HI>Her,</HI> and declares
unto <HI>Her</HI> that <HI>He</HI> believes that Heaven
had conducted <HI>Him</HI> by this tempest
about this coast, to quench <HI>Her</HI> teares,
since <HI>He</HI> brought <HI>Her</HI> backe all <HI>Her</HI> ri∣ches,
which <HI>She</HI> had so much deplor'd.
The Queene impatient to know the
truth, leaps aboard, where <HI>He</HI> followes
and shewes <HI>Her</HI> immediately the Boxes,
well lock'd up. <HI>She</HI> opens them, and
found therein all what <HI>She</HI> sought for,
and particularly the Cabinet, which
serv'd afterwards to reconciliate <HI>Her
<PB N="49" REF="33"/>
Sonne</HI> with <HI>Poliarchus.</HI> Then <HI>She</HI> cryed
out with great joy, and imbracing the
<HI>Prince,</HI> called <HI>Him,</HI> the <HI>God Saviour of
Mauritania,</HI> thence <HI>She</HI> led him to <HI>Her
Palace,</HI> and forgot no kinde of magnifi∣cence
and good entertainement, to te∣stifie
how welcome <HI>He</HI> was. Amongst
all this mirth and gladnesse <HI>Poliarchus
His</HI> soule was all troubled with <HI>Licoge∣nes
His</HI> letters, &amp; though <HI>He</HI> could not
suspect <HI>Meleander</HI> of this perfidiousnesse,
<HI>He</HI> was not fully satisfied of <HI>Him;</HI> To
pull out all these thorns from <HI>His</HI> soule,
<HI>He</HI> resolves to send <HI>Gelanore</HI> into <HI>Sicily,</HI>
and to give him letters to <HI>His Argenis,</HI>
but not unto <HI>Meleander,</HI> to whom <HI>He</HI> was
contented to send <HI>Licogenes His</HI> letters,
to the end <HI>Gelanore</HI> might judge by <HI>His</HI>
countenance what <HI>He</HI> had in <HI>His</HI> soule,
and if one might believe of <HI>Him</HI> so un∣worthy
a wickednesse. It was in a good
time that <HI>Gelanore</HI> arrived in <HI>Sicily,</HI> be∣cause
<HI>Arsidas</HI> accompanied with <HI>Timo∣nides,</HI>
which was he unto whom <HI>Mele∣ander</HI>
had given the Bracelet to carry,
was going to spread abroad the rumour
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
of <HI>Poliarchus His</HI> death throughout
all the <HI>Court.</HI> The <HI>Pilote</HI> of the ship in
which <HI>He</HI> had made shipwracke, having
by good fortune saved himselfe, had
brought word unto <HI>Arsidas</HI> of the mis∣fortune
which was happened unto <HI>Him,</HI>
and had described unto him the man∣ner
of <HI>His</HI> losse. <HI>Arsidas</HI> having at the
same time met with <HI>Timonides,</HI> and
learn'd of him the subject of his jour∣ney,
had stayed it, and had made him
partaker of these bad newes. They
had then gone together very sad unto
the <HI>Court,</HI> knowing not how to publish
this accident, which was enough to
cause <HI>Argenis's</HI> death with sorrow. The
first whom they encountred at their
landing was <HI>Gelanore</HI> which came from
<HI>Affricke</HI> from the <HI>Prince of France:</HI> At
the sight of him they thought they had
beene in another world, because they
had bin assured he had perish't with his
<HI>Master:</HI> it was then as a sunne of good
hope which began to shine upon them.
But said they unto him; <HI>Gelanore,</HI> where
is <HI>Poliarchus?</HI> the ill newes which wee
<PB N="51" REF="34"/>
have heard puts us in such trouble, that
wee cannot beginne our complement,
but with this question. <HI>Poliarchus</HI> is very
well, replied <HI>Gelanore;</HI> I have left <HI>Him</HI>
in <HI>Affrick,</HI> and am come to see the <HI>Prin∣cesse</HI>
on <HI>His</HI> behalfe. You revive us, re∣plied
the <HI>Princes</HI> two friends, without
any further delay <HI>Argenis</HI> must have no∣tice
of it, for feare least this ill rumor
which wee have heard should have bin
spread in the <HI>Court, Arsidas</HI> vndertakes
this commission, and assoone receaves
a command to fetch <HI>Gelanore.</HI> When he
comes before the <HI>Princesse,</HI> he kisses the
letters, and presents them unto <HI>Her</HI> to∣gether
with his <HI>Masters</HI> commendations:
<HI>She</HI> tooke a singular content at the read∣ing
of the letters: But when <HI>She,</HI> had
opened <HI>Licogenes His</HI> letter, <HI>She</HI> was
seized with horror, and resolv'd that
<HI>Her Father</HI> should see them, as also <HI>Gela∣nore</HI>
had order to present them unto
<HI>Him. Meleander</HI> having seene them con∣ceav'd
an extraordinary spite, not only
against <HI>Licogenes,</HI> but also against <HI>Poliar∣chus,</HI>
that without writing, had sent unto
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>
<HI>Him,</HI> such infamous letters, of a traitor;
and testified not unto <HI>Him</HI> the little
faith which <HI>He</HI> gave to them. Insomuch
that as <HI>Gelanore</HI> who had all the <HI>Prin∣cesses</HI>
dispatches, went to take leave of
<HI>Him,</HI> and ask't <HI>Him</HI> if he would not do
the honor unto <HI>His Master</HI> to write to
<HI>Him. Go your wayes,</HI> said he, <HI>and tell your
Master, that I am a King, and not a Poiso∣ner:</HI>
Neverthelesse that caused two of
<HI>Licogenes's</HI> friends, who had lately bin
arrested, to be tortur'd, as having plot∣ted
something against the <HI>Kings</HI> honor,
and against the quiet of <HI>His State, Gela∣nore</HI>
went backe, towards <HI>Mauritania,</HI>
where he found <HI>Poliarchus</HI> yet sicke of
<HI>His</HI> fever. Having delivered <HI>Him</HI> the
<HI>Princesses</HI> letters; he told <HI>Him</HI> all the
particulars of the <HI>Court of Sicily,</HI> and a∣mongst
other things, complained, of <HI>Ar∣chombrotus
His</HI> great pride▪ who would
not daigne to looke upon him, insinua∣ting
thereby, openly enough, that he
beleeved he aspir'd to marry the <HI>Prin∣cesse;</HI>
there needed no more to put <HI>Poliar∣chus</HI>
in the field. Then, notwithstanding
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>
<HI>Gelanore's</HI> remonstrances who charg'd
<HI>Him</HI> on the behalfe of <HI>Argenis,</HI> to go in
<HI>His Kingdome</HI> and bring succours, to put
<HI>Sicily</HI> in liberty, <HI>He</HI> resolv'd to returne,
disguis'd as before, in <HI>Meleanders Court;</HI>
And to that end, seekes out the cure of
<HI>His</HI> ague, in a strange remedy, having
better succeeded therein, then the <HI>Phy∣sitians</HI>
had judged; he went presently to
take <HI>His</HI> leave of the <HI>Queene,</HI> who
would by all meanes stay him: but <HI>He</HI>
alleag'd <HI>Her</HI> so many reasons, that <HI>She</HI>
was forc't to let <HI>Him</HI> go, for feare <HI>She</HI>
should be a hindrance in the effecting of
the great affaires which (as <HI>He</HI> said) <HI>He</HI>
had in hand. <HI>She</HI> would have given <HI>Him</HI>
magnificent presents, but <HI>He</HI> who
would not take any thing, of all <HI>Her</HI>
treasures, but one only ring, which per∣force
<HI>She</HI> caused <HI>Him</HI> to accept, remai∣ned
satisfied with the honor of <HI>Her</HI> fa∣vour,
and having ship't <HI>Himselfe,</HI> hastned
so much the Pilote and Mariners, that in
a short time <HI>He</HI> arriv'd at the <HI>Court of Si∣cily.
Gelanore</HI> had charge to advertise
<HI>Arsidas,</HI> to the end he should beare the
<PB N="54" REF="36"/>
newes unto the <HI>Princesse;</HI> he did it with
such dexterity, that there is <HI>Poliarchus</HI>
amongst the <HI>King of Sardany's</HI> and <HI>Ar∣chombrotus
His</HI> practises, neere unto <HI>His
Argenis,</HI> under favour of <HI>His</HI> borrowed
face. The joy which <HI>They</HI> received at
the sight of each other, is beyond ex∣pression:
The conclusion of <HI>Their</HI> en∣terview
was, that at this present <HI>He</HI>
should breake all obstacles, and should
goe directly in <HI>His Kingdome,</HI> to leavie
a puissant Army, that <HI>He</HI> might free <HI>Her</HI>
out of the hands of so many Suters, who
were so importunate unto <HI>Her. He</HI> then
leaves <HI>Sicily,</HI> and happily arrives in <HI>His
Realme, where He raises</HI> a Royall Army,
which <HI>He</HI> presently ships, for the effe∣cting
of this great voyage, and to shew
unto the eyes of <HI>Sicily,</HI> as a sparkling of
the glory of <HI>His</HI> birth. But it happened,
that being at Sea, the Navy was bea∣ten
with a furious storme, that inten∣ding
to hold their course towards <HI>Si∣cily,
He</HI> was cast upon the Coast of <HI>Mau∣ritania,</HI>
where <HI>He</HI> found wherewith to
cause <HI>His</HI> valour to appeare, and to give
that successe to <HI>His</HI> affaires, which <HI>He</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>
did not imagine, should be there. Never∣thelesse
<HI>His</HI> absence, a hundred times
blam'd by <HI>Argenis,</HI> which could not tell
what Starre to accuse, of this mis-for∣tune,
was the cause that the <HI>Moore</HI> and
<HI>the King of Sardany</HI> continued their pur∣suits;
The <HI>Sardiot</HI> imagining <HI>He</HI> was
abus'd, resolved to steale away <HI>Argenis,</HI>
and to ship <HI>Her</HI> in <HI>His</HI> owne Navy, and
so returne with so rich a Prey into <HI>His
Kingdomes.</HI> The <HI>Moore,</HI> who had an
eye on all sides, discovers this designe,
advertises the <HI>King,</HI> and gives <HI>Him</HI> such
true tokens thereof, that <HI>Meleander</HI> gives
notice unto <HI>Radiroboranes</HI> that <HI>He</HI> igno∣red
not <HI>His</HI> practices, which gave <HI>Him</HI>
cause to breake wholly with <HI>Him.</HI> To
be reveng'd on <HI>Meleander, He</HI> writ <HI>Him</HI>
a letter, full of contempt and outrages
against <HI>Argenis,</HI> whose Governesse <HI>He</HI>
had suborned, which had discovered
unto <HI>Him, Poliarchus His</HI> secrets and
<HI>Their</HI> loves, <HI>Meleander</HI> afflicted beyond
measure of this affront, is angry with
<HI>Argenis,</HI> which justifies <HI>Her</HI> innocence, by
she her selfe who had betrayed <HI>Her.</HI> This
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>
miserable wretch seeing her selfe dis∣covered
did seeke (by the meanes of
poison) the expiation of her crime, and
procur'd her owne death, before the
eyes of the <HI>Court. Meleander</HI> to shun a
greater mis-fortune, and to fortifie
<HI>Himselfe</HI> with friends, went to <HI>His Daugh∣ter,</HI>
&amp; speakes to <HI>Her</HI> to marry the <HI>Prince
of Mauritania,</HI> of whose merit and valour
<HI>He</HI> spake advantagiously to enduce <HI>Her</HI>
to consent. <HI>She</HI> demands some time to
resolve <HI>Her selfe,</HI> and represents unto
<HI>Him,</HI> that it would bee a shame for a
<HI>Kings Daughter,</HI> to give <HI>Her</HI> faith so
slightly unto a man who had not so
much as demanded it, with the solem∣nities
accustomed in like occurrences.
<HI>Her Father</HI> grants <HI>Her</HI> two months time,
and Fortune lengthned this terme:
<HI>The King of Sardany</HI> full of rage and de∣spight,
for so bloody an affront, puts
under sayle, leaves <HI>Sicily,</HI> and having a
favourable wind, within a short time,
arrives in <HI>His Kingdome. His</HI> soule being
wounded, causes <HI>Him</HI> to undertake re∣venge
(of the injury which <HI>He</HI> had re∣ceived
<PB N="57" REF="37"/>
in the <HI>Court of Sicily</HI>) upon <HI>Mau∣ritania;
He</HI> imagined that <HI>He</HI> could
easily conquer that Great <HI>Kingdome,</HI>
where there was but a <HI>Queene,</HI> which
held the reines of the <HI>Empire;</HI> but the
storme, which was like to cast away <HI>Po∣liarchus,</HI>
saved the <HI>Moores</HI> and their
<HI>Crowne.</HI> The tempest having cast <HI>Him</HI>
upon that coast, <HI>He</HI> offers <HI>His</HI> Army,
unto their <HI>Queene,</HI> who knew the obli∣gation
which <HI>She</HI> had unto <HI>Him</HI> in the
former voyage: <HI>She</HI> accepted those ad∣vantageous
offers, and recommended
unto <HI>Him,</HI> the safety of <HI>Her State.</HI> After
many encounters, sometimes the victory
was seene to leane on the <HI>Sardinians</HI>
side, and sometimes on the <HI>Affricans,</HI>
assisted with the <HI>Gaulois.</HI> At last they
came to a set battell, which having been
bloody amongst the souldiers, was no
lesse cruell betwixt the <HI>Generals.</HI> These
two generous <HI>Princes</HI> edg'd on, by a
secret hatred which they bare one to
another, sorted themselves during the
horror of the fight, and filled with a
furious animosity, caused their soul∣diers
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>
to retire, that they might end the
Combat, and end their differences by
the death of the one or the other; After
a great conflict they were separated
twice: But both aspiring to the victory,
and being impatient at this succour, out
of rage and despite threatned their
souldiers to fall on them, if they had
the audacity to hinder them any more.
They beginne their conflict the third
time, but they appeared so wearied and
weakned by reason of the losse of their
blood, that it was thought the Conque∣rour
should have no great cause to glo∣rifie
himselfe of his victory, at the end
of the Combat. In the end neverthe∣lesse
<HI>Poliarchus</HI> who had some advan∣tage
upon the <HI>Sardiot,</HI> for the last blow,
finding out a place through the defect
of <HI>His</HI> Armour, thrusts <HI>His</HI> sword
through <HI>His</HI> throat, and sacrifices <HI>Him</HI>
to the <HI>Princesse of Sicily's</HI> wrath; <HI>Radiro∣branes</HI>
whose soule was already upon <HI>His</HI>
lips thrust <HI>Himselfe</HI> on <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> and
fell downe upon <HI>Him:</HI> but being be∣reaved
of life, <HI>Poliarchus</HI> disingag'd
<PB N="59" REF="38"/>
<HI>Himselfe</HI> by little and little, from under
this body, and appeared victorious in
the <HI>Head</HI> of <HI>His</HI> Troopes: The <HI>Moores</HI>
know not what Trophies to erect, to
the <HI>French Princes</HI> vertue; their <HI>Queene</HI>
avouches, that <HI>Her Sonne</HI> and <HI>She</HI> owe
unto <HI>His</HI> courage, all the remainder of
the good fortune which they have in
the world. Going to visit <HI>Him;</HI> when
<HI>He</HI> was sicke, of the wounds which <HI>He</HI>
had received in the Combat, after many
praises said to the Conquerours glory,
<HI>She</HI> speaks unto <HI>Him</HI> of the happy pur∣chase,
which <HI>Her Sonne</HI> had made in
<HI>Sicily,</HI> and in few words gives <HI>Him</HI> to
understand that <HI>Meleander,</HI> holding
<HI>Himselfe</HI> extreamely obliged unto <HI>His</HI>
valour, had offered <HI>Him His Daughter</HI>
in marriage. At this word all <HI>Poliar∣chus
His</HI> wounds did bleed afresh, and
seemes by the palenesse of <HI>His</HI> face, that
<HI>His</HI> soule is going to abandon <HI>His</HI> body,
as being weary to dwell in it: But this
is not all, here's a mightier wave, which
comes to encounter <HI>Him,</HI> to banish out
all patience from <HI>His</HI> soule. The <HI>Queene</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="39"/>
had conjurd <HI>Her</HI> Sonne by <HI>Her</HI> letters,
that <HI>He</HI> should make a journey into <HI>His
Kingdome,</HI> before <HI>He</HI> married the <HI>Prin∣cesse
of Sicily,</HI> and to induce <HI>Him</HI> to make
this voyage, had represented unto <HI>Him</HI>
the mis-fortunes whereof <HI>His State</HI> was
threatned by the <HI>K. of Sardany's</HI> Army.
There <HI>He</HI> is come, and led to <HI>Poliarchus
His</HI> chamber, whō <HI>He</HI> had cruelly offen∣ded:
<HI>Poliarchus</HI> feared not this encounter
at all, because the <HI>Moore</HI> bore another
name in <HI>Sicily,</HI> then in <HI>His Kingdome,</HI> but
knowing <HI>His</HI> Rival, remēbers what the
<HI>Queene</HI> had told <HI>Him,</HI> touching <HI>Her Sons</HI>
marriage with <HI>Argenis.</HI> Griefe so over-mastered
<HI>His</HI> senses, that at this sight, all
full of rage, he turn'd <HI>His</HI> head on the
other side, shews tokens of <HI>His</HI> spight,
and receaves no better countenance of
the <HI>Moore;</HI> who resolves to avenge <HI>Him∣selfe</HI>
of the obstacle, which <HI>He</HI> gives to
<HI>His</HI> Nuptials, imagining, that the delay,
w<SUP>ch</SUP> <HI>Argenis</HI> had ask't, was for <HI>His</HI> sake:
They come to words which testifie the
great adversion which they have against
each other. The <HI>Queene</HI> much astonied,
<PB N="61" REF="39"/>
brings forth <HI>Her Son</HI> out of the sick mans
chamber, chides <HI>Him</HI> for <HI>His</HI> incivility,
represents unto <HI>Him</HI> the obligation w<SUP>ch</SUP>
<HI>He</HI> hath to the <HI>French Prince,</HI> and by way
of reproach, gives <HI>Him</HI> to understand,
that <HI>He</HI> shall be for ever blamed, to have
so unworthily used an outlandish <HI>Prince,</HI>
unto whō <HI>His Crown</HI> is so strictly oblig'd.
In the meane time examining exactly
the cause of so cruell a hatred, who had
made <HI>Poliarchus,</HI> to resolve to take Sea,
thus sicke and ill as <HI>He</HI> was, <HI>She</HI> finds
out, that it was Iealousie, which they
had each of the other concerning <HI>Arge∣nis,</HI>
which had stirred up this storme:
That comforts <HI>Her,</HI> beleeving <HI>She</HI> had
found the meanes to agree them with∣out
much trouble. <HI>She</HI> speakes to both
the <HI>Princes;</HI> Imperiously, to <HI>Her Sonne;</HI>
Courteously, unto that of <HI>France: She</HI>
conjure <HI>Them,</HI> to referre the decision
of their differences, unto <HI>Meleander: And
I will cause,</HI> (said <HI>She</HI> unto <HI>Poliarchus)
that you shall have the</HI> Faire Argenis, <HI>and
that my</HI> Son <HI>shall not loose</HI> Her This pro∣mise,
as an Oracle, with two faces, doth
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>
astonish the <HI>Princes,</HI> but the respect
which they bare to the <HI>Queene,</HI> obliges
them to beleeve <HI>Her,</HI> and to give a true
Faith, unto <HI>Her</HI> words, and stay with
patience, what the event will be, where∣of
both the one and the other seemed
to hope well. Thus, <HI>Poliarchus</HI> is conju∣red
to remaine in the <HI>Court of Maurita∣nia</HI>
to cause <HI>His</HI> wounds to be healed,
and in the meane time the <HI>Moore</HI> lands
<HI>His</HI> Navy in Sardany full of factions by
the death of their <HI>King. He</HI> conquers it
with little trouble; <HI>He</HI> comes backe
Victorious to meet the <HI>Queene his Mo∣ther,</HI>
which at <HI>Poliarchus His</HI> intreaty,
dispatches them both with <HI>Her</HI> letters,
to goe, and decide their difference,
before <HI>Meleander</HI> unto whom they had
referred it by <HI>Her</HI> Counsell. <HI>She</HI> gives
a <HI>Cabinet,</HI> unto <HI>Her sonne,</HI> to carry unto
<HI>Meleander;</HI> the pretious stones which
were in it, were of an inestimable value,
but that was not the secret. Having
taken leave of the <HI>Queene,</HI> the two <HI>Ri∣vall
Princes,</HI> hoise up saile, shewing no
signe of anger, against each other: They
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>
arrived much about one time in <HI>Melean∣ders
Court. Argenis</HI> hath notice that <HI>Po∣liarchus</HI>
is so neere unto her: This joy
had transported <HI>Her,</HI> if rage had not
cross't it, when <HI>She</HI> heard, that <HI>He</HI> had
made <HI>Her Father</HI> Umpire of <HI>Her</HI> mar∣riage.
<HI>Is it then,</HI> said <HI>She, all the esteeme</HI> He
<HI>makes of me, to put Himselfe thus in hazard,
to lose Me? And if my</HI> Father <HI>who hath an
inclination for the</HI> Moore, <HI>gives</HI> Me <HI>unto</HI>
Him, <HI>doth he thinke, that I will ever con∣sent
thereunto? Before that shall happen,
steele, or poison shall put</HI> Me <HI>out of the world:
I shall have more courage then</HI> He: <HI>my death
shall blot out all the Trophies that this</HI>
Moore <HI>goes fancying in his minde, and</HI>
Poliarchus <HI>shall know that I can love, more
constantly, and truly then</HI> He. <HI>At least if</HI> My
<HI>sexe takes away the meanes, to dispute
against</HI> Him, <HI>the glory of Armes, nothing
shall hinder</HI> Me, <HI>to take from</HI> Him <HI>that of
Constancy. This list is open to all the coura∣gious
spirits, without distinction of sexe,
and I shall not be the first Virgin, who hath
surpassed men, in fidelity.</HI></P>
<P>In the meane time the two <HI>Lovers</HI> are
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>
favourably receaved at <HI>Court,</HI> where
<HI>Poliarchus</HI> began to reassume <HI>His</HI> luster,
and as it were, to darken a little the
<HI>Prince of Mauritanias</HI> glory, they go to
salute the <HI>King,</HI> who at first sight, makes
them the best welcome which they can
desire. <HI>Poliarchus</HI> was the first which
made <HI>His</HI> complement in few words.
But the <HI>Moore</HI> having presented those
letters with the <HI>Cabinet</HI> whereof <HI>His
Mother</HI> had charged <HI>Him</HI> to give unto
<HI>Meleander,</HI> saw <HI>Himselfe</HI> ingaged in a
longer discourse.</P>
<P>At the opening of the letters, the
<HI>King</HI> changed colour, having read them
very exactly, and with an extraordinary
attention, <HI>He</HI> tooke a little Golden Key,
which the <HI>Queene of Mauritania</HI> had in∣closed
in them, and opened the <HI>Cabinet,</HI>
where <HI>He</HI> found things, which did bal∣lance
<HI>His</HI> Spirits in such sort, that
among'st the tokens, which <HI>He</HI> gave of
<HI>His</HI> contentment, the teares were seene
to trickle downe <HI>His</HI> cheekes, in such
abundance, that all the company was
astonied thereat. At the instant forget∣ting
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>
<HI>Himselfe</HI> a little in point of ciuility,
<HI>He</HI> left the <HI>Prince of France</HI> alone, and
drew the <HI>Moore</HI> aside as to entertaine
<HI>Him</HI> more privatly and with more
liberty; this negligence was no∣thing
to what followed: holding of
<HI>Him</HI> aside, takes <HI>Him</HI> about the necke,
imbraces and kisses <HI>Him,</HI> and gives <HI>Him,</HI>
the most sensible testimonies which <HI>He</HI>
could wish, of <HI>His</HI> affection. Not con∣tented
with that, <HI>He</HI> sent in all hast for
<HI>His Daughter,</HI> to whom as <HI>She</HI> arrived,
<HI>He</HI> said softly, some few words accom∣panied
with an action which seemed to
be an image of joy, in <HI>His</HI> heart. The
<HI>Princesse</HI> taking no heed to what was so
neere unto <HI>Her,</HI> advances to salute the
<HI>Moore</HI> with visible signes of Love, <HI>Poli∣archus</HI>
remaines astonied at this spe∣ctacle,
and knowes not how to behave
<HI>Himselfe,</HI> but judging by the good enter∣tainment,
which <HI>Argenis</HI> gave unto
<HI>Archombrotus,</HI> that all his hopes were
ruinated, and that <HI>His</HI> rivall was going
to triumph, with <HI>His</HI> pursuits; yielded
unto despaire, and in the bitternes of <HI>His</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>
thoughts, began to say within <HI>His</HI> soule;
<HI>Is this then the fruit of so many paines
which I have taken, and so many hazards
which I have runn'd, to assure</HI> My selfe <HI>of
the love, of this prodigious inconstancy,</HI> She
<HI>to whom the most violent rigors of a</HI> Fa∣ther,
<HI>with a thousand Martyrdomes ought
not to have chang'd, nor altered, suffers</HI>
Herselfe <HI>to be surpris'd by some flatteries,
which this</HI> Old man <HI>rounds</HI> Her <HI>in the
eare: What mountaines of gold? What per∣petuall
springs of felicity, have beene pro∣missed</HI>
Her, <HI>thus to change</HI> Her <HI>affection,
and alter</HI> Her <HI>minde? unfortunate</HI> Queene
of Mauritania, <HI>a scion of the old stock, what
characters and inchantments host thou
made, upon those letters, to print upon them,
that force, and give them that power, to
cause so monstruous a change, and to ruinate
in so small a time, that which I had built
with so long a patience? How am I punished
of the folly which I have committed, trust∣ing
in the words of a Woman and unto the
promisses of a Damzell, whereof the cunning
and lightnesse, (qualities unseparable to that
sexe) ought to have made me to suspect
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>
them more then the Winds which have
brought and driven me on this infamous
Shore: But however, If</HI> Poliarchus <HI>hath
beene deceaved,</HI> He <HI>can take such a cruel
vengeance, that neither the Authors, nor
confederates of this perfidiousnesse shall have
no great cause to build triumphs, nor erect
trophies to their vanity. This wretched</HI> Old
man, <HI>who by the artificiall deceits whereof</HI>
He <HI>is full, hath alwayes opposed my content∣ments,
and these two insolent Lovers, who
sport at the ship-wracke of my fortune, shall
be the sacrifices of</HI> My <HI>fury: But it is not all,
I will also dye, to the end my</HI> Ghost <HI>may
pursue and persecute that ungratefull</HI> Arge∣nis,
<HI>unto the Throne of the immortall</HI> Gods:
<HI>Before whom I will reproach</HI> Her <HI>prodigious
infidelity, that a thousand oathes taken in
their name, ought to have stayed, if</HI> She <HI>had
had the feeling and beliefe which</HI> She <HI>should
have had of their power and justice;</HI> It is
apparent, that it was <HI>Poliarchus His</HI> good
<HI>Genius,</HI> or the <HI>Tutelary Angell of Sicily,</HI>
which busied <HI>His</HI> Spirit, in these Tra∣gick
thoughts, to stay <HI>His</HI> designe, and
to divert <HI>Him</HI> during as much space as
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>
needed, to give <HI>Meleander</HI> and <HI>Argenis,</HI>
time to remember themselves, and to
come and make their excuses. As <HI>He</HI> was
then, upon the point to goe and exe∣cute
so furious a designe, and to put <HI>Me∣leander,
Argenis,</HI> and <HI>His Rivall</HI> out of
the world, and after this bloody execu∣tion,
to run <HI>His</HI> sword through <HI>His</HI>
body, and by that meanes to leave Tra∣gick
tokens of <HI>His</HI> jealousie and despite:
Those who seemed, to have too much
neglected <HI>Him,</HI> came to themselves
againe, and perceaving their fault, went
towards <HI>Him</HI> to make their excuses,
and discover the cause of this joy, which
having ravish't them, out of themselves,
had made them, to forget all civility:
<HI>Poliarchus</HI> finds the charmes of <HI>His</HI> fury
and frensie in their discourses and rea∣sons:
The <HI>Moore</HI> is acknowledged to be
<HI>Argenis's Brother;</HI> the <HI>Queene of Mauri∣tania,</HI>
had discovered the History by
<HI>Her</HI> letters, and had given such good
tokens unto <HI>Meleander,</HI> that <HI>He</HI> could
not doubt, but that <HI>He</HI> was <HI>His Sonne,</HI>
and the true <HI>Heire</HI> of the two <HI>Crowns,</HI> in∣somuch
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>
that <HI>Archombrotus</HI> receiving the
succession of <HI>His Estates,</HI> left freely the
possession of the <HI>Princesse His sister,</HI> unto
<HI>Poliarchus,</HI> who would not have chan∣ged
it with a thousand <HI>Scepters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Meleander,</HI> seing that the most part of
the assistants, vnderstood nothing in
these wonders, and that every one de∣sired,
a more particular enlightning,
tooke the word, and making a short
discourse of the voyage which <HI>He</HI> had
made in <HI>Affricke</HI> during the heat of <HI>His</HI>
youth, avowed that <HI>He</HI> had beene ena∣moured
of a Beauty, whose favour
having purchas't, <HI>He</HI> had at last mar∣ried
<HI>Her</HI> secretly, and that <HI>His</HI> affaires,
having called <HI>Him</HI> backe into <HI>Sicily,
He</HI> had left <HI>Her</HI> with child, of a <HI>Sonne,</HI>
which was <HI>Archombrotus,</HI> whom, since
<HI>Hyanisbe,</HI> seeing <HI>Herselfe</HI> without chil∣dren,
by the <HI>King Her husband,</HI> had sup∣posed;
fayning to have beene brought
a bed of <HI>Him,</HI> that <HI>She</HI> had beene in∣duc't
thereunto, because <HI>Her</HI> Sister,
(which was <HI>She,</HI> whom <HI>He</HI> had loved,)
seing <HI>Herselfe</HI> ready to dye, in childe-bed,
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>
had discovered the Secret, unto
<HI>Her.</HI> Therefore it was not to be doubted
but that <HI>Archombrotus</HI> was <HI>Argenis's
Brother,</HI> to whose marriage for that
cause <HI>He</HI> could not aspire, but left the
free possession of her, unto <HI>Poliarchus,</HI>
an Incomparable <HI>Prince,</HI> and worthy
the Alliance of the greatest <HI>Princesse</HI> of
the earth; and accordingly, if ever
<HI>Sicily</HI> had seene <HI>Her selfe</HI> at the height of
good Fortune, it was now where the
destinies had brought it unto, by un∣knowne
meanes unto men, that there∣fore
all the World should give signes
of a publike gladnesse, and that every
one should runne unto the <HI>Temples</HI> of
their <HI>Gods,</HI> to give them a thousand
thankes, for so many blessings show∣red
downe upon <HI>His Crowne.</HI> At these
words the people was seene transpor∣ted
with a secret ravishment, by gi∣ving
such testimonies of joy, amongst
their Feasts, and Sacrifices: <HI>Meleander</HI>
with <HI>Archombrotus</HI> consent, offers the
<HI>Kingdome of Sardany,</HI> unto <HI>Poliarchus</HI> for
<HI>Argenis's</HI> Marriage; <HI>Poliarchus</HI> being
<PB N="71" REF="44"/>
marvellous well contented, makes ou∣verture
of an Alliance, for <HI>Archombro∣tus</HI>
with a <HI>Sister</HI> of <HI>His, Daughter of
France,</HI> which doth accept this glorious
party with a thousand thankes, so that
the two <HI>Crownes</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> re∣mained
united with such strong Bonds,
that it seemed, the destinies would
make this Alliance, perpetuall.</P>
<P>On the other side, <HI>Poliarchus</HI> sees
<HI>Himselfe</HI> at the height of <HI>His</HI> desires, see∣ing
that <HI>He</HI> was in possession of <HI>Her,</HI>
whom <HI>He</HI> loved more dearely, then <HI>His</HI>
owne life. Truely even as the rigours
of a long Winter, causes the Spring to
be found more pleasing, so all the cros∣ses
which <HI>He</HI> had suffered in this pur∣suit,
caused <HI>Him</HI> to finde the enjoying
of it, so much the sweeter.</P>
