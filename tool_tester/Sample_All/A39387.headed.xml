<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE extraordinary
Conduct of the Im∣perial
Court and
Council for some
years past, having rais'd the
Curiosity of a great Prince
of the Empire, to find out at
any rate the true Causes and
Grounds of Counsels and
Actions that had so much
surprized him, he made choice
of a Minister whom he judg∣ed
best capable to execute this
Design, and having given
<PB REF="3"/>
him Instructions for the pur∣pose,
dispatched him private∣ly
under other pretences to the
Emperours Court at <HI>Prague</HI>
The Minister acquitted him∣self
well, and gave his Ma∣ster
an ample account of his
Business by Letter, of the 13.
of <HI>February</HI> 1680. The Ma∣ster
(a right <HI>German,</HI> and
truly generous Prince) laid
his Commands on me to pub∣lish
those important Secrets,
the value whereof will soon
appear by the reading, from
which I will no longer de∣tain
you.</P>

<HEAD>THE
EMPEROUR
AHD THE
EMPIRE Betrayed.
AND
By Whom, and How.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS the duty of a Ser∣vant
not to conceal
any thing from his
Prince and Master,
especially when he is pleased to
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
honour him with his Confidence,
as your Higness hath done in
sending me to this Court: To
clear my self from the Guilt
and Reproach of having been
wanting to this Duty, I take the
liberty to give your Highness a
faithful and candid account in
Writing; what I have discovered
most pertinent and Essential to
the business, you were pleased
to employ me in. I shall do it
with the less scruple and reserve,
having sent this Letter by an
Express, in whom I have entire
Confidence, and doubt not but he
will, according to my order, de∣liver
it into your Hands.</P>
<P>To begin with the best part of
what I have to deliver, I am to
inform your Highness, that His
Imperial Majesty is, in my Opi∣nion,
a pious Prince, good na∣tured,
and of a sweet and gentle
Disposition, and not at all incli∣ned
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
to contend with the Princes
his Neighbours, or make War
on his Inferiors: That, pursuant
to this natural Inclination for
Repose and for Peace, this Prince
hath an Antipathy against any
thing that disturbs or opposes his
quiet Disposition, and hath eased
himself wholly of the manage∣ment
and direction of his Affairs
of State, and of War, by com∣mitting
all to the Conduct of his
principal Ministers. 'Tis hard
for a Prince to intrust a Minister
with Affairs of this mighty Im∣portance,
without opening to
him all his Mind, and imparting
the greatest and deepest of his Se∣crets:
And from hence, I believe
it hath unhappily followed that
this Prince, having by degrees
accustomed himself to leave the
greatest part of his Affairs to the
Conduct of his Ministers, hath
reserved to himself only the Title
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
and Pomp, the Splendour and
Name of the Dignities and Gran∣deur
proper to his Character. In
a Word, had his Imperial Majesty
never so little minded his great
Affairs, he would never have
yielded to sign that shameful and
ignominious Peace with <HI>France,</HI>
subscribed by the Imperial Em∣bassadours
at the Congress ad <HI>Ni∣miguen;</HI>
the unhappy Effects
whereof we have seen in seven
Particulars of great importance.</P>
<P>First, His Imperial Majesty, by
those few strokes of his Pen, hath
in all probability, lost for ever the
Esteem, the Friendship and Con∣fidence
of the Princes his Friends
and Allyes; who would have ge∣nerously
defended and preserved
him from ruine, by the force of
their Arms.</P>
<P>Seconldy, That his own Troops
have been shamefully forced to
quit all the Countries of the Em∣pire,
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
while those of <HI>France</HI> have
been actually there, and continue
to this day insulting and Domi∣neering
as they please over the
Princes, the Cities, the Coun∣tries
and Provinces of the Em∣pire.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That by the Execu∣tion
of this Peace, the Estates,
the Persons and the Courts of the
three Ecclesiastical Electors of
the Empire, and of the Elector
<HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> stand in a
manner expos'd every hour to
the violences and irruptions of
the Arms of <HI>France;</HI> and conse∣quently,
in case of an Election
of a King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> we
may probably find by their Suf∣frages
what may be expected
from Slaves to that proud and
ambitious Crown.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That his Imperial
Majesty having by that Peace ta∣citely
consented to the late Cessi∣on
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
on made by <HI>Spain</HI> of the Coun∣ty
of <HI>Burgundy</HI> to the Crown of
<HI>France:</HI> It follows, that if His Im∣perial
Majesty, (in Case of failure
of Issue in the House of <HI>Spain)</HI>
should in his own Right, or in the
Right of the Arch-Dutchess his
Daughter, the Heir to the E∣states
of that Monarchy, he hath
by that Article of the County of
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> released his Right to
it, and deprived his Successors,
and the Empire of the Conveni∣ence
that Country might upon
a favourable Revolution have
afforded them to lead an Army
without opposition into the
heart of <HI>France:</HI> And should
<HI>Lorrain</HI> be ever restored to the
Empire, yet this Article will be
an infallible means for <HI>France</HI> to
maintain continually an Army
on the Frontiers of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
invade it as often as it shall ap∣pear
to be for the Interest and
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Grandeur of the <HI>French</HI> to attack
the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, That though <HI>Swizzer∣land</HI>
be throughly convinced
by the building the Fortress of
<HI>Hunninges,</HI> of the Ambitious
designs of <HI>France,</HI> and conse∣quently
concerned and inclined
to make a League with all, or
part of the Princes of the
Empire, in defence of the
Common Liberty; yet the un∣fortunate
Session of the County
of <HI>Burgundy</HI> hath furnished the
Pensioners of <HI>France,</HI> (whom no
Counsel or Caution of that Re∣publick
is free from) with a
plausible argument, to perswade
that Republick not to stir in its
own defence, till it be perhaps
too late, and out of its power
to help it self: For, say they,
What shall we do? The <HI>Cantons</HI>
of <HI>Bern, Fribourgh</HI> and <HI>Sollurre</HI>
cannot subsist without the Salt
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
of that Province: Besides the
Forces his most Christian Ma∣jesty
keeps actually on Foot
there, may justly alarm us to be
cautious to the utmost, what
measures we take, and consider
all things before we ingage in
any: By such discourses as these
(though groundless if we suppose
an Union of the Forces of the
Empire with the <HI>Swisse,</HI> which
would infallibly draw in many
more) it may fall out that this Re∣publick
(if the lowest party pre∣vail
not against those Traytors to
their Country) may to its own
mischief, and the ruin of others,
lye still and look on, as uncon∣cerned,
and consequently be a
Member wholly useless to the
Publick, for defence of the Com∣mon
Liberty, which would be
in the present Conjuncture of
more mischievous Consequence
han most are aware of.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Sixthly, That by this peace
the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who hath
had the honour to <HI>Marry</HI> a great
Queen eldest Sister to his Impe∣rial
Majesty, hath found as little
respect in this Peace, as if he had
married the Daughter of a <HI>Burgo-Master</HI>
of <HI>Colmar;</HI> and hath been
violently robb'd, and intirely dis∣possest
of his Dukedoms of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI>
and <HI>Bar,</HI> and several other
Lands he held in Soveraignty,
being his Hereditary Estates,
and descended to him by unque∣stionable
right of Succession:
Which others looked on with so
little concern, as if this Prince
(stript of all he could call his own)
had lost no more than a Ring, or
a Farm of a thousand Crowns
value.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That his Imperial
Majesty, and the Empire by
Signing a Peace (to give it its
right Name) so unbecoming and
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
unworthy, have raised the cou∣rage
and hopes of the most Chri∣stian
King to that height, that he
looks on both with so much in∣difference
and scorn, that he hath
openly undertaken at once three
things, which (I believe) were
ever heard of in the Empire, at
least when it had the advantage
of a Head that had the least jea∣lousie
and care for its Glory.</P>
<P>The first, that without any
Lawful Mission, the Emperor
being young, and in perfect
Health, he solicites vigorously the
two Electors of the North side of
the Empire, for their Suffrage
at the next Election of a King of
the <HI>Romans.</HI> I mention only
these two Electors, for as for
the others, he makes no doubt
by fair means or by force to dis∣pose
of them as he shall think
fit.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="8"/>
The second, that, as if he
were dealing only with the Far∣mers
of his Revenues, or the
Poysoners of <HI>Paris,</HI> he hath by
a Declaration erected at <HI>Metz</HI>
(as formerly at <HI>Brisak)</HI> a Court
compos'd according to the course
of that Kingdom, of a dozen
Hangm—where though the
smallest Duke and Peer of <HI>France,</HI>
is not obliged to appear; His
most Christian Majesty, as Judge
and Party, cites by some Catch∣pole
of that <HI>Clandestine</HI> Juris∣diction,
Princes of the most anci∣ent
Illustrious Houses of the Em∣pire
(which he hath nothing to
do withall) to make their appea∣rance,
to give him Account by
what right they possess what
their Predecessors have for
three or four hundred Years
peaceably enjoyed. This inven∣tion,
with the help of the Knight
of the Post, and a Map of the
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
Country drawn out at pleasure,
(but of the old fashion, the bet∣ter
to colour the business) is the
ground of his pretensions, that
the greatest part of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the
whole Dukedom of <HI>Deuxpents,</HI>
and the best part of <HI>Alsatia,</HI> as
far as <HI>Lauterbourgh,</HI> are ancient
Dependencies of the Bishopricks
of <HI>Metz, Toul</HI> and <HI>Verdun,</HI> and
must consequently be re-united
to the Demeans of that Crown
with as much ease, as the Lands
of some wretched Treasurers of
<HI>France</HI> have been resumed by his
Majesty.</P>
<P>The third is, that to the end
his new Paper-pretences, may
be as effectual as the right of de∣volution
of the low Countries in
1667 and 1668. He hath upon
the Frontiers on this side conside∣rable
Forces in readiness to Exe∣cute
the Reunion, or rather, un∣der
that pretence, to do what
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
he shall think fit in the Empire;
when all this while, neithe his
Imperial Majesty, nor any Prince
of the Empire dares openly stir.
As if what hath already been
done to the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI>
and other Princes and Ci∣ties
of the Empire in <HI>Alsatia,</HI>
were not only a certain presage,
but an unquestionable President,
whereby all other Princes and
States of the Empire of what qua∣lity
and degree soever, may clear∣ly
see the Fortune of those Prin∣ces
and States, who have the mis∣fortune
to hold of that Crown,
or be Neighbours to its Domini∣ons:
The consequences that na∣turally
follow so untoward, and
so unhappy a State of Affairs will
oblige us to Conclude; Woe
to his Imperial Majesty, if he do
not wholly alter his Conduct,
and God grant I speak not pro∣phetically
and truly, as <HI>Micajah</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
when I say His Imperial Majesty
will dearly rue his trusting his
Council with the direction and
management of Affairs of this
Nature: And wo to His Imperi∣al
Majesty and the Empire, they
ever signed that false and fatal
Peace, whereby both will natu∣rally
fall (unless God by special
interposition prevent it) under
the slavery of that absolute and
despotical Dominion. Yet I
would not be thought to be of O∣pinion,
that if all His Imperial
Majesty's Council were such as it
ought to be, Affairs would be in
that ill condition we find them;
but the greater part of that
Council being weak or corrupt∣ed,
as I dare say it is, we are not
to doubt, but if it continues,
things will still grow worse and
worse: I have been bold to say,
the greater part of the Imperial
Council is Weak or Corrupt:
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
And to make my words good,
I will proceed by degrees
from smaller matters to those
of greatest importance, to prove
what I affirm by unquestionable
Instances.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="instance">
<HEAD>The first <HI>Instance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Commissary General <HI>Capellier</HI>
surpriz'd the Steward of his House
in the very act of Traiterous Cor∣respondence
with the Minister of
<HI>France,</HI> to whom he gave an ex∣act
Account of all he could disco∣ver
at his Master's House. The
Letters he sent to the <HI>French</HI> Mi∣nister
and those he received from
him were seized at the Imperial
Post Office at <HI>Frankfort:</HI> And
though this happened in the heat
of the War between the two Na∣tions,
and the Traitor upon dis∣covery
of the matter was arrest∣ed,
and carried to <HI>Philipsbourgh,</HI> &amp;
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
From thence to <HI>Vienna,</HI> yet he
(a Fellow worth nothing) found
at Court such powerful support,
that he was set at Liberty, and
cleared as a gallant Person.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="instance">
<HEAD>The second <HI>Instance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Siege of <HI>Phillipsbourg,</HI> be∣ing
form'd by the Imperial
Troops and those of the Circles,
and the place so much straitned
that they began to want Powder
in the Town, two Brothers, Bur∣gesses
of <HI>Franckfort,</HI> corrupted by
a <HI>French</HI> Minister, undertook to
buy several Waggon Loads of
Powder in the Empire, and to
conveigh them into <HI>Phillipsbourg</HI>
with other Ammunition. But
the Convoy for executing the
Design having been surprized by
the Imperialists, and one of the
Rogues taken and sent to <HI>Vienna,</HI>
he was not long there but he was
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
set at liberty as a very honest
Fellow.</P>

<HEAD>The third <HI>Instance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>He that commanded in <HI>Fri∣bourgh,</HI>
when taken by Marshal
<HI>Crequi,</HI> could not deny himself
notoriously guilty of Cowardice,
or Treason; being arrested for
his Crimes, and carried first to
<HI>Inspruck,</HI> and thence to <HI>Vienna:</HI>
he was look'd upon as a Sacrifice
necessary to be offer'd to expiate
so hainous an offence against E∣quity,
Policy, and the Discipline
of War; but because he was re∣lated
to a principal Minister, or
rather because a Great One was
afraid he might (if put hard to it)
make some discoveries: He was
fully acquitted, and cleared from
all that was laid to his charge;
and in such a manner, that he
retired home as confident, and
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
unconcerned, as ever the <HI>French</HI>
Governour of <HI>Phillipsbourgh</HI>
could have done, after the gene∣rous
defence he made of the
Post he commanded.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="instance">
<HEAD>The Fourth <HI>Instance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxe Eisnach</HI>
having had the Command of a
little Army on the <HI>Rnine,</HI> be∣ing
an active and brave Prince,
neglected not any thing that
might conduce to the worthy dis∣charging
the Duty of his place;
those of the Imperial Council,
who took part with <HI>France,</HI> ha∣ving
designs contrary to those of
that Prince, were as active on
the other side, by close and sudden
wayes to bring two things to pass:
The first was to raise and esta∣blish
a mis-understanding be∣tween
this Prince, and his High∣ness
of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> Commander
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
in chief of the great Army of the
Empire: The Second was, to
order the distribution of Ammu∣nition
necessary for the Army in
such a manner, that when it was
provided of one sort, it should
certainly want another: When
it had Cannon, it wanted Carri∣ages;
and when it had both these
it should have neither Powder
nor Bullet: And to give those
of the Council their due, their
designs took effect to admiration,
for the whole story of that Cam∣paign
is (in short) no more but a
misunderstanding between these
Princes, and want of Ammuni∣tion.
But this was not enough,
for the malice of these Emissaries,
they poceeded further to hire
one under the name of <HI>Dela Mag∣delaine,</HI>
who having been instruct∣ed
by the Major <HI>Domo</HI> of the Ab∣bot
S. <HI>Gall</HI> (of whom we shall
have occasion to speak hereafter)
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
was set on to seduce and surprize
this Prince: In a word, he came
to the Duke of <HI>Saxe Eysenach</HI> to
propose to him the surprizal of a
Fortress belonging to <HI>France</HI> in
the higher <HI>Alsatia:</HI> The propo∣sal
was guilded over with so
much probability of success, that
the Duke animated with zeal to
do something great for the Glo∣ry
of his Imperial Majesty, and
the Interest of his Country,
greedily hearkned, and quickly
embraced the proposal. After
some necessary precautions for
the Enterprise, <HI>Duneewald</HI> was
commanded to undertake the
Execution, and having in the
Action discovered the Cheat,
the Duke us'd his endeavours to
have the Criminal Arrested:
But all to no purpose; for the
Major <HI>Domo</HI> had already secu∣red
him in a place of safety: I
make no doubt but every one
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
will grant me, this Rogue de∣served
death, and had not any
colour of pretence, to find esteem
or safety in the Empire: But it
proved quite otherwise upon his
Capitulation, (I mean that with
the Major <HI>Domo)</HI> for the Rogue,
having play'd this excellent trick,
had the impudence to go to the
Emperours Court, where he was
very well received, and highly
treated, and sent thence to <HI>Bres∣law,</HI>
where Count <HI>Shaftkutsch,</HI>
President of the Imperial Cham∣ber
in <HI>Silesia,</HI> pays him constant∣ly,
by order from above, annually
a considerable Pension: This
arrant Cheat goes now as for∣merly
under the Name of <HI>Cygale,</HI>
and gives out he is a-kin to the
Grand Signior: But it hath been
made appear in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
that he is a Native of <HI>Mal∣davia,</HI>
and was Groom to a
Prince of that Country: This is
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
the true Character of him, the
rest that is said of him are but in∣ventions
of Jesuits and Monks,
who go snips with him in the
Presents he receives on his Lying
pretences. I have been more
particular in my account to your
Highness of this Fellow, to arm
you the better against a surprize,
by his Fictions and Artifices,
which he continues to practise
every day in hope to get some∣thing
from those he can impose
upon.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="instance">
<HEAD>The Fifth <HI>Instance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>By what I have said formerly
of <HI>Swizzerland,</HI> it may appear
of what importance it may be to
the Emperor and Empire to
make that Republick sensible of
their true interest, and treat with
them for a League and Union of
Forces in defence of the Com∣mon
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
Liberty; and (to bring this
about) to employ in the Negotia∣tion,
Persons not only capable
and faithful, but acceptable to
those they are to treat with: Yet
as if the Emperor's Council made
it their business to do in this as o∣ther
particulars, only what may
gain them the favour, or the Gold
of His most Christian Majesty.
'Tis fit to know the Person the
Emperor's Council employs in
all those important Negotiati∣ons
they have with that Re∣publick.
It is no other than the
Abbot S. <HI>Gall's</HI> Major <HI>Domo,</HI> a∣bove
mentioned, called Monsieur
<HI>Fidelle,</HI> (Mr. <HI>Faithful,)</HI> but by
the same figure of speech our
Divines call the Prince of Dark∣ness
an Angel of Light: For this
Fellow is notoriously known and
confest to be the falsest of Men.
Yet being a Person of a very
ready wit, a lively fancy, and
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
naturally active in what he un∣dertakes,
sometimes he openly
acts on the part of <HI>France,</HI> and
publickly solicits Suffrages in this
Republick in favour of that
Crown; sometimes he turns his
Coat, and is on the sudden all
for the House of <HI>Austria:</HI> This
man from a petty Pedler of <HI>Italy,</HI>
is become excessive Rich, which
I mention as a circumstance
whereby it may be the better
known what a Man he is, how
fit to negotiate the Interests of
his Imperial Majesty, and to be
the Confident and Councellor of
the Ministers of State; His
Council sends into these parts:
And to make appear their Wis∣dom
or Collution in this parti∣cular,
I must acquaint your
Highness with a matter general∣ly
known throughout the <HI>Swisse</HI>
Cantons.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="15"/>
That this man is owner of a
Moity of two <HI>Swisse</HI> Companies,
now actually in the Service of
the <HI>French,</HI> under the command
of his Son in Law: (An Ordina∣ry
Traffick among the <HI>Swisses)</HI>
That his most Christian Majesty
hath within these three years be∣stowed
on him a Rich Canonry,
in the higher <HI>Alsatia,</HI> or <HI>Brisgow,</HI>
which one of his Sons is invested
in: That 'tis this faithful Mini∣ster
of the Imperial Court, hath
since the beginning of the last
War, bought all the Horses his
Christian Majesty had need of for
his Armies, and caused them to
be transported from the Port of
<HI>Wasserbourgh</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> (where
his Master hath a Bayliff, and
no small Power) to the Port of
<HI>Rochas,</HI> in <HI>Swizzerland,</HI> which
is a place whereof his Master is
Soveraign Prince: That this
man being the principal incendi∣ary
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>
and Fomenter of all the trou∣bles
and broils hapned in <HI>Swisser∣land,</HI>
these last twenty years; is
so generally hated by all good
people of that Nation, that to
procure the miscarriages of any
affair of the Dyets of <HI>Baden,</HI> there
is no surer means than to make
the Assembly suspect this man
hath a hand, or is any way con∣cerned
in it. This appeared
clearly in the affair of the County
of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> for Count <HI>Cazatti,</HI> the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Embassadour, having very
unadvisedly resolved to make use
of this mans Counsel and Con∣duct
in a matter of that impor∣tance,
that <HI>mighty</HI> affair was utter∣ly
ruin'd by that very means: Not∣withstanding
all, this man is the
Confident and privy Councellour
of all the Ministers his Imperial
Majesty sends to that Nation; and
their first business, when arrived
there, is to visit him, to consult him
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>
and communicate to him all their
instructions: This about three
years since, occasion'd a pleasant
passage at the Dyet of <HI>Baden:</HI> An
Envoy of his Imperial Majesty,
(whom I purposely forbear to
name) according to the Custom
of his Predecessors in that Employ,
and the Orders establisht, went
presently after his arrival to con∣sult
this Oracle; going afterward
to <HI>Baden,</HI> the Envoy was strange∣ly
surprized to find that <HI>Gravelle</HI>
the <HI>French</HI> Embassadour had al∣ready
Communicated to the As∣sembly
all the private Instructi∣ons
the Envoy had received from
the Council at <HI>Vienna:</HI> Thus
that Envoy's Nogotiations came
to nothing, and so will all o∣thers
his Imperial Majesty shall
permit to be managed by the
false and Corrupt Conduct of a
Man so base, and altogether
unworthy the honour of that
Employment.</P>

<HEAD>The Sixth <HI>Instance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'Tis an infallible Maxim, that
every Prince dispossest of his E∣state,
may hold for certain, there
will be nothing omitted on the
part of the Usurper, or a Con∣querour
in possession to ruin him,
if possible, and all his Generation.
Therefore 'tis not strange, that
the Ministers of <HI>France</HI> (though
perhaps in this particular against
the intention and without the
order of his most Christian
Majesty) leave no stone unturned
for the destruction of his High∣ness
of <HI>Lorrain:</HI> But it may sur∣prize
any man to find that the
Imperial Governour of <HI>Phillips∣bourgh,</HI>
should (so openly and
notoriously, as he did) have at∣tempted
the destruction of that
Prince, by the trap he caused
cunningly to be made in the
bridge of that place, for that pur∣pose,
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>
through which the good
Prince fell headlong to the bot∣tom
of the Ditch: May we not
justly infer, this Governor had
capitulated and agreed with some
Minister of the Enemy to com∣mit
so vile a Treason? May we
not conclude so black an attempt
against a Soveraign Prince, Bro∣ther
in Law to the Emperor,
and at that time representing the
Person of His Imperial Majesty,
under the Character of <HI>Genera∣lissimo</HI>
of his Armies, unquestio∣nably
merited exemplary punish∣ment?
No honest Man but ex∣pected
the Criminal should have
been made a Sacrifice to Justice
and Vengeance, when he was
taken and carried under a strong
Guard to <HI>Vienna.</HI> But all that was

<HI>France</HI> had that influence over the
Council at <HI>Vienna,</HI> that this Vil∣lain,
as the former, past altogether
unpunished.</P>

<HEAD>The seventh <HI>Instance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It appears publickly his most
Christian Majesty since the <HI>Peace</HI>
Arms by Sea and Land more
powerfully than before; and
<HI>France</HI> being not sufficient for the
Levies he makes, he is come by
his Ambassadour to the Center of
the Empire, to <HI>Frankford</HI> and to
<HI>Prague</HI> to compleat them. He
causes Fortresses and Places of
strength to be every day built on
<HI>Saar,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and all the
Frontiers of <HI>Germany,</HI> I think
there needs no better evidence
of his having a Design to re∣duce
<HI>Almayn</HI> into a condition of
disability of help it self, when he
thinks fit to attacque it; if we
consider farther, that he causes
his Commissaries to buy up all
the Corn in <HI>Swabe</HI> and <HI>Franco∣nia,</HI>
which is daily carried away
<PB N="31" REF="18"/>
into his Magazins in <HI>Lorrain, Al∣satia,</HI>
and the County of <HI>Burgun∣dy.</HI>
Let us examine on the other
side the conduct of the Head and
Natural Defender of the Empire,
or rather of his unhappy Coun∣cil:
This Prince hath since the
<HI>Peace</HI> reformed all his Troops;
and in particular the Garrison of
<HI>Rhinefeld,</HI> which is of principal
consequence: Let us weigh the
matter without prejudice: He
hath disbanded most of his old
Regiments, and kept on foot
only part of the new. A man
must be blind, and void of com∣mon
sense, who comprehends
not that the Imperial Council
hath in this particular acted by
inteligence with the Council of
<HI>France,</HI> and by their direction,
to deprive the Emperor of the
only Officers and Soldiers ca∣pable
to defend him, and to make
them immediately go over into
<PB N="32" REF="19"/>
the service of <HI>France:</HI> The mat∣ter
hath fallen out according to
their design, and I leave it to
any man versed in matters of
State or of War, to judge what
a Conduct so extraordinary as
this doth naturally signifie.</P>
<P>I should be too tedious to give
you all the Instances I know
whereby to prove the Emperour
is certainly betray'd by the grea∣ter
part of his Council. But to
be short, let it be observed, that
the same Council that cleared
the Steward of Commissary <HI>Ca∣pelliers,</HI>
the Traytors of <HI>Frank∣fort</HI>
who would have furnished
<HI>Philipsbourgh</HI> with Powder in the
Siege, and the Governour of <HI>Fri∣bourgh:</HI>
The same Council that
hath protected at <HI>Brestaw</HI> the Vil∣lain
who abused the Duke of
<HI>Saxe Eisnach,</HI> and procur'd a Pen∣sion
to be setled on him; the
same Council that hath setled the
<PB N="33" REF="19"/>
<HI>Major Domo</HI> of the Abbot S. <HI>Gall.</HI>
to be the Imperial Minister in
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> and prevented the
exemplary punishment of the Go∣vernour
of <HI>Phillipsbourgh;</HI> the
same Council that advised His
Imperial Majesty to reforme the
greatest part of his Troops, and
in the manner I have told you;
this is the very Council hath
clearly acquitted and approved
of all the Conduct and publick
Robberies and Insolencies of
Commissary <HI>Capelliers,</HI> and o∣thers:
and by causing His Impe∣rial
Majesty, to sign the late
shameful <HI>Peace,</HI> have reduced
the too good Prince into such a
Condition, that (without a spe∣cial
Providence of God to the:
contrary) no <HI>Prince</HI> will hence∣forth
without much difficulty
and caution relye on his Word
or his Signet: So that consider∣ing
the Activity, the Power and
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>
Interest of his Enemy, with the
credit and influence he hath in
the Emperor's Council, His Im∣perial
Majesty, as to his Elective
Imperial Crown (and I know
not what to say of his Heredita∣ry
Dominions and Estates) seems
reduced to the Condition of a
<HI>Chilperic,</HI> or a <HI>Charles</HI> in <HI>France;</HI>
for he hath more than one <HI>Pepin,</HI>
or one <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> to deal with.
Nor do I see he hath any grea∣ter
Authority than had those two
unfortunate Kings, who were
violently thrust out of their
Thrones; which neither they,
nor any of their <HI>Posterity</HI> ever re∣gained.
The better to convince
the World how foully His Impe∣rial
Majesty is betrayed by his
Council, and in him all the <HI>Prin∣ces</HI>
and <HI>States</HI> of the Empire,
and that there hath been of a
long time a horrid and villainous
<HI>Plot</HI> carried on against them
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>
with great cunning and caution,
give me leave to observe that
it proceeds from the secret En∣gines
of this Plot, that His Im∣perial
Majesty's two Sisters were
Married to Princes, both Robbed
of their Dominions and Estates:
As to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> Hus∣band
of the Elder, he continues
to this day stript of all his Estates,
and if the late Peace hold, I see
little hopes of his Re-establish∣ment.
And it cannot be deny'd but
that the Duke of <HI>Newbourgh,</HI>
though restored by the Peace to
the Dukedoms of <HI>Juliers</HI> and
<HI>Berg,</HI> was out of possession of both
at the time of the Marriage of his
Son to the Emperor's younger
Sister. The Reasons of these Mar∣riages
were, that the Princesses
being Married (as they are) to Prin∣ces
uncapable to afford His Impe∣rial
Majesty any Succour at need,
neither His Majesty nor his Allies
<PB N="36" REF="21"/>
might have any benfit by the
Marriages. And that when ever
<HI>France</HI> should be desirous of
Peace, there might be those in
the Imperial Councils and Court,
whose Interest would oblige them
to desire and procure it, in order to
their restoration and re-establish∣ment
in their Estates, and to free
themselves from the necessity of
begging their Bread elsewhere. It
hath happened accordingly as to
the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> at least,
for having not wherewith to
bear the Charge of the Marriage
of his Son with the Emperor's
Sister, without being restored to
the Dutchies of <HI>Juliers</HI> and <HI>Berg,</HI>
which could not (at least so spee∣dily)
be effected without a <HI>Peace,</HI>
what wonder is it, that this <HI>Prince</HI>
hath for the time past (being
forced by his Necessities) joyned
with that part of the Emperor's
Council that was for <HI>Peace,</HI> and
<PB N="37" REF="21"/>
assisted them in perswading His
Imperial Majesty to sign it on any
Condition: Nor can it appear
strange, if this <HI>Prince</HI> for the su∣ture
joyn with the same Council,
and use all his Credit and Interest
with His Imperial Majesty, never
to enter into a War with <HI>France,</HI>
though he have never so great
Reason for it. <HI>For when wants
and Necessities enter in at the Door,
Honour and Friendship flyeth out
at the windows.</HI></P>
<P>His Highness of <HI>Lorrain</HI> (to
give him his due) hath done
bravely on his occasion, having
generously chosen to run the
<HI>Risque</HI> of losing all, rather than
sign so shameful and unjust a
<HI>Peace,</HI> as that proposed to him
by <HI>France:</HI> And I shall be very
much deceived, if he or his reco∣ver
not their Estates rather by
this than any other Conduct:
For Revolutions are Common to
<PB N="38" REF="22"/>
all, and I have particular Reasons
to believe it may one day happen
so in the Affairs of his High∣ness.</P>
<P>This I think is more than suf∣ficient
to Evince that His Impe∣rial
Majesty hath been basely be∣trayed
by his Council.</P>
<P>My next business is to shew by
what sort of People he hath been
chiefly betrayed, and with what
Covers they have guilded those
Pills, which they have made this
Good and August Prince swallow
from time to time.</P>
<P>To find the bottom of this bu∣siness,
we must look a great way
back, as far as the beginning of
the War, which <HI>France</HI> by Con∣cert
with <HI>England,</HI> the Elector of
<HI>Cologne,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI>
and the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> made
against the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in
1672. After several Alliances
with the Deceased Elector of
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>
<HI>Bavaria,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Hanover,</HI>
and others, which were but too
visible during that War.</P>
<P>Several pretences have been
made use of to colour that Rup∣ture,
but the truth is, it was fo∣mented
only by the Court of
<HI>Rome</HI> and the Jesuits: To give
your Highness full and clear sa∣tisfaction
in this particular, be
pleased to permit me to put you
in mind, that a little before the
breaking out of that War, his
Royal Highness of <HI>Savoy</HI> Decea∣sed,
having taken his Measures
with the Court and Council of
<HI>France,</HI> made open War against
the Republick of <HI>Genoa.</HI> The
Court of <HI>Rome</HI> wisely judging
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> would not
have engaged in that Enterprize
without assurance before hand of
Succour and Protection from
<HI>France,</HI> if needful; and that
those petty Sparks might raise a
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>
General Conflagration in <HI>Italy,</HI>
which in time might draw over
thither all the <HI>French</HI> Forces, and
consequently expose that Coun∣try
to inevitable Ruin; that sub∣til
and cunning Court, to save
themselves from the storm, appli∣ed
themselves seriously,</P>
<P>In the First place, to put an end
upon any terms to the War be∣tween
the Duke and the Repub∣lick,
which Monsieur <HI>Gaumont</HI>
soon after effected.</P>
<P>In the next place, being sen∣sible
what formidable Forces His
Most Christian <HI>Majesty</HI> had then
on foot, and that that <HI>Monarch</HI>
could not forbear breaking out
into a new War; the Court of
<HI>Rome</HI> resolved to use all their en∣deavours
to divert from them∣selves
and their Neighbours,
the Effects of the <HI>French</HI> Arms,
and cause them to fall on some
other Country of <HI>Europe,</HI> the
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>
most remote that might be from
<HI>Italy,</HI> and where it might be most
Convenient for the Interest of
the <HI>Pope:</HI> The Jesuits having gi∣ven
directions to this purpose,
the affair was manag'd with that
subtilty, the Storm fell altoge∣ther
on the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> the
Court of <HI>Rome</HI> assuring it self,
that if that Republique were
once destroy'd, the whole <HI>Prote∣stant
Party</HI> would naturally come
to ruin, and the <HI>Papal</HI> Authority
in a short time recover it's primi∣tive
Grandeur and Glory. Great
Obstacles were quickly discove∣red
against the carrying on this
mighty <HI>Project:</HI> The most Chri∣stian
King who clearly saw what
the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> aim'd at, was,
or pretended to be, unwilling to
engage in Open War against the
<HI>United Provinces,</HI> but on two
Conditions.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="24"/>
First, That the Court of <HI>Rome</HI>
should secretly consent and give
way that he might, if he could,
joyn the <HI>Provinces</HI> of the
<HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI> and <HI>Lorrain,</HI>
with what he could Conquer
from the States of the <HI>United
Provinces,</HI> to form or restore the
Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Austrasia.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, that the <HI>Court</HI> of
<HI>Rome</HI> should assure him, to their
<HI>Power,</HI> to procure his <HI>Majesty</HI> and
the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> (who was designed
the New King of <HI>Austrasia,)</HI> the
Imperial Crown.</P>
<P>As to the point of the <HI>Spanish
Netherlands,</HI> it must be observ'd,
that to bring about the Design,
it was absolutely necessary to ma∣nage
his <HI>Majesty</HI> of <HI>Great Brit∣tain,</HI>
(whose interests there were
very considerable) and there could
be no hopes to give him satisfa∣ction
without Sacrificing to him
something very considerable of
<PB N="43" REF="24"/>
what belong'd to the <HI>Spaniard.</HI>
It would have been almost im∣possible
for any but the <HI>Jesuits</HI> In∣terests,
so different, to reconcile
and overcome so great and Nu∣merous
Difficulties. The two
Branches of the most August
House of <HI>Austria,</HI> had heap'd
most considerable Favours, and
showed their Bounties, on the So∣ciety
of Jesuits: But when they
are concerned for the Grandeur
of the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the Interests of
the <HI>Miter</HI> (which (by the way)
the Society looks on with the
same Ardour a young <HI>Prince</HI> in
Love would eye the advantages,
the Glory and Interests of a Beau∣tiful
and rich Queen, whom he
made no doubt but he should one
day enjoy) all Thoughts and me∣mory
of the favours received
from the <HI>August Family,</HI> are
wholly laid aside on that occa∣sion;
the <HI>Jesuits</HI> fell immdiately
<PB N="44" REF="25"/>
to find out Expedients for two
Reasons, full of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI>
according to the <HI>Politick Maxims</HI>
of that Blessed <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>The first was that whereas the
House of <HI>Austria</HI> in the present
Conjuncture was notoriously un∣able
to raise the <HI>Roman Bishops</HI> to
their former Estate of Grandeur
and Glory, and that there was
not any but His most Christian
<HI>Majesty,</HI> who by his <HI>Forces</HI> and
<HI>Interests</HI> could work this kind of
<HI>Miracle</HI> it was absolutely necessa∣ry
to remove all Difficulties and
Obstacles that might hinder the
effecting an enterprise so <HI>Profi∣table</HI>
and <HI>Glorious.</HI></P>
<P>The Second, That in case the
Design should take effect, the So∣ciety
was assured of having in
recompence of their pains, two
great Abbies, Heads of their Or∣ders,
the one in the Ancient King∣dom
of <HI>France,</HI> the other in the
<PB N="45" REF="25"/>
<HI>New Conquests:</HI> Which Abbys
were to be added to the vast <HI>Pa∣trimony</HI>
of this Society, besides
the assurances they had by the
protection of <HI>France,</HI> to obtain a
Settlement in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and
elsewhere. Upon these Grounds
they procur'd the Treaties to be
privately sign'd between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Rome,</HI> and between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>England,</HI> by vertue whereof
the War was quickly begun a∣gainst
the <HI>United Provinces.</HI></P>
<P>I pass over in silence the satis∣faction
his <HI>Majesty</HI> of <HI>Great Brit∣tain</HI>
was to have, as impertinent
to my present business: It may
be observed, that as under the
Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> the second <HI>France</HI>
was to have been made (as far as
it lay in the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Rome)</HI> a Sa∣crifice
to the Interests of the <HI>Pa∣pal
Miter,</HI> and the <HI>Monarch</HI> of
<HI>Spain,</HI> 'tis now become the turn
of the most August House of
<PB N="46" REF="26"/>
<HI>Austria,</HI> (according to this Pro∣ject)
to be Sacrificed to the inte∣rests
of the Papacy, the Jesuits
and his most Christian Majesty.
And that as the principal design
of the Jesuits, and of <HI>France,</HI>
was the absolute destruction of
the Protestant Party, it was
from hence it proceeded, that a
League was form'd and sign'd by
most of the Catholick Princes of
<HI>Germany,</HI> and incorporated into
the Treaties above mention'd,
wherein every of the Confede∣rates
had, or at least thought to
have had his design, and com∣pass'd
his ends, as afterwards
appear'd: Hence also it proceed∣ed
that <HI>France,</HI> having anciently
had very strict alliances with
the Protestant Princes of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
conceal'd very carefully
the present design from all its
ancient Allyes of that Commu∣nion.
The Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
<PB N="47" REF="26"/>
the Society as carefully con∣ceal'd
it from both branches of
the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> and all
this for reasons, than which no∣thing
is more easily apprehend∣ed:
For the same reason it was,
that in the beginning of this
War, nothing was omitted by
the Popes Nuncio, the Jesuits,
and their Emissaries, to lull a∣sleep
the Councils of <HI>Vienna</HI> and
<HI>Madrid;</HI> and that afterwards
they did with all possible dili∣gence
reveal to the Ministers of
<HI>France,</HI> all they could discover
of the deliberations of the Impe∣rial
Council, or the Spanish.
For the same reason it was, that
his Imperial Majesty by the clear
Remonstrances of the Elector of
<HI>Brandenbourgh</HI> being made sen∣sible
of the Trap cunningly laid
for him by the <HI>French,</HI> and ha∣ving
commanded an Army to
joyn with that Elector on the
<PB N="48" REF="27"/>
<HI>Rhine,</HI> those Emissaries of <HI>Rome</HI>
laid all their heads together, and
for their Master-piece to carry
on the Design, effected two
things.</P>
<P>The first was the Rebellion of
the <HI>Male Contents</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> not
yet Suppressed, whereby they
endeavour'd, if possible, to give
the <HI>Emperour</HI> so strong a diversi∣on,
that it might not be in his
Power to assist his Allies.</P>
<P>The second, I have from an
Anonimous Author of an Essay
of the Interest of the <HI>Protestant
Princes</HI> and <HI>States, Printed</HI> in
the year, 1676. and treating of
several things, in this respect ve∣ry
considerable: The Author in
my Opinion deserves the more
Credit, in that he hath lash'd the
Society to some purpose in his
Discourse, yet not one of it's Pa∣trons
or Partisans hath under∣took
to refute him: The account
<PB N="49" REF="27"/>
he gives of the first Campaign, I
will repeat Word for Word from
the Original, as very sutable to
my purpose.</P>
<P>In the Year 1672. when the
Arms of <HI>France</HI> were so pros∣perous,
that all <HI>Europe</HI> looked on
the States of the <HI>United Provin∣ces</HI>
as very near Destruction,
His Electoral Highness of <HI>Bran∣denbourgh</HI>
wisely foreseeing the
Consequences to be expected
from the Ambitious Enterprizes
of <HI>France,</HI> if not stopped in time,
gained himself the Reputation,
not only of having been the first
Prince of <HI>Christendom</HI> who
drew his Sword in Protection of
that broken State, but by vigo∣rous
Remonstrances to the Court
of <HI>Vienna,</HI> was the cause that His
Imperial Majesty, awaking out
of the <HI>Lethargy</HI> some corrupt
Counsellors had cast him into,
resolved to Arm vigorously, and
<PB N="50" REF="28"/>
joyn with his Electoral Highness
in Defence of that Republique:
His Electoral Highness in pursu∣ance
of this Resolution being
advanc'd towards the <HI>Rhine,</HI> with
a considerable Army, and <HI>Count
Montecuculi</HI> being on his way
thither in the Head of an Impe∣rial
Army, with design to act
jointly, and to do something
considerable in favour of the Re∣publique.
<HI>France,</HI> allarm'd by
the March of the two <HI>German</HI>
Armies, had detach'd Marshal
<HI>Turenne,</HI> with a Body of an Ar∣my
to observe the motions of the
other two: But by the several
Marches and Counter-Marches
these two Armies had made, es∣pecially
that of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI>
sometimes making as if they
would pass the <HI>Rhine</HI> in several
places, sometimes in being ready
to fall upon the Allies of <HI>France</HI>
beyond the <HI>Rhine, Turennes</HI> Ar∣my
<PB N="51" REF="28"/>
was so tyr'd out and haras∣sed,
that about the end of the
Campaign it was almost quite
dissipated, and found it self in
so miserable a Condition, that
'tis certain all <HI>Turenne</HI> was able
to do, was to be on the defen∣sive
against one of those Armies,
and that if both Armies had
join'd, <HI>Turenne</HI> had been inevita∣bly
lost, as was publickly confest.
His Electoral Highness of <HI>Bran∣denburgh</HI>
knowing how easie it
was to destroy <HI>Turenne,</HI> and the
Consequence of his Defeat, cau∣sed
a vigorous Remonstrance of
all to be made to the Council of
<HI>Vienna;</HI> it was so effectual, that
positive Orders were sent <HI>Monte∣cuculi</HI>
to join his Electoral High∣ness
and Fight <HI>Turenne,</HI> without
further loss of time; which
would have broken all the open
and hidden Measures of <HI>France,</HI>
and by one blow freed the <HI>Em∣pire</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="29"/>
and <HI>Holland</HI> from Oppressi∣on.
But other matters were in
hand for the Interest of <HI>Rome.</HI>
His Majesty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI>
had permitted himself to be per∣swaded
to publish about that
time, a Declaration (whereof
he made Report to his Parlia∣ment,)
whereby a Tolleration
and Indulgence was granted in
favour of the <HI>Nonconformists</HI> of
his Kingdom. Though it may
be thought it was not so much
for favouring the particular Con∣venticles
of the Sectaries of
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Party, as, under
the name of <HI>Non-Conformists,</HI> to
introduce <HI>Popery</HI> again into that
Estate, though contrary to the
Designs and Intentions of His
Majesty, who granted it only in
favour of the tender Consciences
of his <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects: This
Step towards <HI>Popery</HI> being the
First Fruits the Court of <HI>Rome</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="29"/>
had promised it self from the
Ruin of the States of the <HI>United
Provinces,</HI> 'tis no wonder that
Court set all hands at work to ef∣fect
that Ruin. The then prin∣cipal
Obstacles of the Design, was
the Resolution of His Electoral
Highness against <HI>Turenne,</HI> the
Destruction of his Army being
capable to Re-establish the States
of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and
that Re-establishment would
have destroyed all the Projects of
the Jesuits in <HI>England.</HI> Here it
was the Jesuits plaid their part to
prevent the blow from fallin on
<HI>Turenne,</HI> and they acted it too
well for the general Good of <HI>Eu∣rope:</HI>
for <HI>Montecuculi</HI> instead of
receiving Express Order to joyn
<HI>Brandenbourgh</HI>'s Army, and fight
<HI>Turenne,</HI> received Orders quite
contrary; whereby he was abso∣lutely
forbidden to do the one or
the other. To drive this Nail
<PB N="54" REF="30"/>
to the head; the venerable So∣ciety
(whose impudence nothing
can parallel) made it their busi∣ness
several ways to infuse into
his Electoral Highness a jealousie
of the Emperour, as insincere in
his intentions: this was effect∣ed
with the greater facility, for
that his <HI>E. H.</HI> of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI>
having received from the Court
of <HI>Vienna,</HI> a formal Letter, which
gave him an exact account of the
true order his Imperial Majesty
had sent <HI>Montecuculi</HI> to join him
and fight the <HI>French,</HI> and his <HI>E. H.</HI>
having summoned <HI>Montecuculi</HI> to
execute that Order, <HI>Montecuculi,</HI>
who knew he had Orders quite
contrary, but knew nothing of
the former, of which the Elector
had account, could do no less
than refuse the one and the o∣ther,
nor could his Electoral
Highness choose upon the re∣fusal,
but suspect the sincerity of
<PB N="55" REF="30"/>
the Emperor's Intentions. This
was not enough for those Ma∣sters
of mischief, for at the same
time those Emissaries omitted
nothing that might instill into
<HI>Montecuculi,</HI> a suspicion of the
sincerity of the Elector's Intenti∣ons.
These Jealousies being but
too deeply established, especial∣ly
on this last side, 'tis no won∣der
His Electoral Highness was
at last perswaded (as these Emis∣saries
had by a third Hand infi∣nuated
to him) that the House
of <HI>Austria</HI> treated under-hand a
separate Peace with <HI>France:</HI>
Which appeared the more pro∣bable,
by the daily Advice he
had of the miserable estate of
<HI>Turenne</HI>'s Army, growing every
hour worse and worse, and the
obstinacy of <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> neither
to joyn him, nor fight. The
Emissaries foreseeing this misun∣derstanding
would vanish in∣time
<PB N="56" REF="31"/>
time, when the truth should ap∣pear,
made use of that conjun∣cture
to set on the Duke of <HI>New∣bourgh</HI>
to manage a particular
Peace between his Electoral
Highness and <HI>France;</HI> which
the Electoral, jealous of the Im∣perialists,
and vext at their pro∣ceedings,
was at last perswaded
to accept, and with so much the
more reason, that as to <HI>Holland</HI>
he pretended they had not satis∣fied
their Engagements to him,
and as to the Interests of the Em∣pire
he reserved himself intire
liberty to arm in its defence, if
<HI>France</HI> should attacque it.</P>
<P>The Elector was concerned in
Reputation to make the Empe∣rour
sensible of his just Resent∣ments
of <HI>Montecuculi</HI>'s proceed∣ing:
<HI>Montecuculi</HI> was strangely
surprized, when at his return to
<HI>Vienna</HI> his Master called him to
a strict account of his Conduct,
<PB N="57" REF="31"/>
and the Reasons why he had
neither joined <HI>Brandenbourgh</HI>'s
Army, nor fought <HI>Turenne,</HI> when
express Orders had been sent
him for both. But if <HI>Montecu∣culi</HI>
was surprized at the Questi∣on,
his Imperial Majesty was no
less at the Answer, when his
sage General produced for his
discharge an Order of his Impe∣rial
Majesty, in very good form,
expresly forbidding him either
to joyn with <HI>Brandenbourgh</HI> or
fight <HI>Turenne:</HI> And 'tis certain,
this General found all the justice
of his Cause, and the assurance
his Master had of his fidelity,
little enough to clear him of this
unhappy Affair. I know this
business is one of those Riddles
never to be decypher'd, unless
the Author will voluntarily
give us the Key. I know 'tis
from hence it proceeds, that one
of the principal Wretches of this
<PB N="58" REF="32"/>
Court hath been formerly char∣ged
with this Forgery: But to
speak the truth, the whole guilt
of this Affair lies at the Doors
of the Emissaries of <HI>Rome</HI> in this
Court, who by secret Contri∣vances
with those of <HI>France,</HI>
found the means to intercept the
true Original Order, and in the
same dispatch to transmit a false
one, but very well Counterfeit
both the Hand and Seal: And
that by People who are not now
to learn that Trade. It being
certain we should not have seen
so many Troubles in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as
daily are there, had these Emissa∣ries
less credit in the Emperours
Court.</P>
<P>His Imperial Majesty, the Ele∣ctor
of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI> and Count
<HI>Montecuculi</HI> know the truth of
all that concerns them in this
Affair: But I am well assur'd not
one of the three knows the se∣cret
<PB N="59" REF="32"/>
Engines set at work in the
business. What I know thereof
comes not from them, but from
a place where every particular
of this Negotiation was known,
and by whom it was animated.
Certain it is, if the point of the
<HI>Catholicon</HI> in <HI>England</HI> had not
been found; the Ministers of
<HI>France</HI> could not have so easily
compassed this Forgery; but by
that every thing became feasible,
the Directors of the Society ha∣ving
voluntarily undertaken to
master all Difficulties.</P>
<P>By the ingenious Deduction of
this Relation, where the Author
speaks plainly, as a man well in∣structed
and acquainted with the
fineness, and superfineness of the
management, and by what I
have said before, on the same
Subject, and every one may of
himself apprehend it appears that
it proceeds from a Principle of
<PB N="60" REF="33"/>
a Papal, or Jesuitical Ambition,
the Council of <HI>Vienna,</HI> from the
beginning of the War, hath
been so well penetrated, direct∣ed,
or altered, that all the Expe∣ditions
of the Imperial Army
(except with convenient distin∣ctions,
the considerable Impor∣tant
taking of <HI>Bonne,</HI> the long
and langushing Siege of <HI>Phillips∣bourgh,</HI>
and the taking it at last,
and the death of <HI>Turenne,</HI> which
was meerly accidental) I say all
the Expeditions, these three
Points excepted, have been from
the beginnings of the Campaigns
to the end of them, but so many
Processions and Pilgrimages of
Shame and of Misery, of Disor∣der
and confusion, as the Sub∣jects
of the Empire know too well,
who have been flay'd to the bone,
and had their Marrow suckedout
by Winter quarters, without con∣sideration,
or mercy, but espe∣cially
<PB N="61" REF="33"/>
the Protestant States and
people, and other Princes, Lords,
Magistrates, Countries and
Towns, who have felt the smart
of that fiery Tryal.</P>
<P>From the same principle it is,
that when by the Expulsion of
the <HI>Swedes</HI> out of the Patrimo∣ny
of the Empire, his Electoral
Highness of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI> and
his Highness of <HI>Zell</HI> and <HI>Osna∣bourgh</HI>
were in a condition (not∣withstanding
the particular peace
of the United <HI>Provinces</HI> and
<HI>Spain)</HI> to transport the chief of
their Forces upon the Frontiers
of <HI>France,</HI> and by so glorious an
Action, to oblige <HI>France</HI> infalli∣bly
to make a peace with the
Empire in general and particu∣lar,
according to Justice and E∣quity,
then were the Emissaries
of <HI>Rome,</HI> so powerful in the
Council at <HI>Vienna,</HI> that they ob∣liged
his Imperial Majesty, to
<PB N="62" REF="34"/>
the prejudice of all his Treaties,
to seal privately such a peace
with <HI>France,</HI> as we have menti∣oned
before; which hath been
manag'd with so much dexterity,
that that good (but for that time
too credulous) Prince did believe,
and perhaps is still of the same
mind, that he acted according
to the most judicious Maxims of
Religion and Prudence: And
because it may concern your
Highness to be inform'd what Ar∣tifices
were used by the Jesuits
and Ministers of <HI>France,</HI> who
went hand in hand, acting by
concert in all this Affair, to en∣gage
his Imperial Majesty to sign
that fatal Peace, there were
sent from <HI>France</HI> under other
pretences the Dutchess of <HI>Mec∣lenbourgh</HI>
to the Court of <HI>Zell,</HI>
and the Count of <HI>D' Epause</HI> to
that of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI> and at the
same time the Jesuits labour'd
<PB N="63" REF="34"/>
so effectually, that his Imperial
Majesty was made believe
(though certainly without just
ground) that the Houses of
<HI>Brandenbourgh</HI> and <HI>Lunenbourgh</HI>
had already agreed, or were
just upon agreeing, to a separate
Peace with <HI>France;</HI> whereby
his Imperial Majesty would be
left alone a prey to the <HI>French</HI>
Ambition. True it is, if those
Princes were in that Conjuncture
(as is very probable) very willing
to keep what they had conquer'd
from the <HI>Swede:</HI> I think they
had done well to have dismist
those Envoys from their Courts,
which had they done, it would
at least have taken away from
the Emperours corrupt Council,
all pretence of rendring them
suspitious to his Imperial Ma∣jesty,
and hastening him in pur∣suance
of that suspition to sign
the peace under Consideration.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="35"/>
To sum up all, we may from
what hath been said, reasonably
infer these three particulars.</P>
<P>First, That his Imperial Ma∣jesty
hath been basely betrayed
by the greater part of his Coun∣cil;
for I am not so malicious
and unjust to confound the inno∣cent
with the guilty, and not to
make an exception (out of the ge∣neral
clause) in favour of those
of his Council, who are men of
Integrity and Honour, who in
truth I think are very few, and
not much in Credit.</P>
<P>Secondly, That his Imperial
Majesty being so villanously be∣tray'd
by his Council, the Em∣pire
in general and particular,
through the indissoluble union
of the head and Members cannot
but miserably participate the
misfortune and sufferings of its
Soveraign, as is very well
known by a fatal, and too long
experience.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="35"/>
Thirdly, that 'tis easie for his
Imperial Majesty, and the Em∣pire,
to know whom they have
equallly cause to complain of,
and from what Principle not
only this Treason is derived, but
all the mischiefs that have affli∣cted
Christendom, for above an
Age, but especially the Empire
since the beginning of the late
War: I say for above an Age, as
to the General; because that
which his most Christian Maje∣sty,
instigated by the Jesuits, un∣dertakes
in our days, is but the
same, which, by instigation of
their predecessors, <HI>Charles</HI> the
first, the Emperour <HI>Fardinand</HI>
the Second, and <HI>Philip</HI> the Se∣cond
of <HI>Spain,</HI> did in their days.
As to the Empire in particular
I say, since the beginning of the
last War; because 'tis certain
his Imperial Majesty hath been
since that time by the means I
<PB N="66" REF="36"/>
have mentioned, so closely beset,
and so strictly observed, that 'tis
not in his power to speak, to ad∣vise,
to wish, or do any thing,
but the Society knows, and ab∣solutely
destroys it, if not suitable
to their particular Interests and
Designs: There is not a person
in the Emperor's Court, but
knows, that no man without
certain ruin dare oppose in that
Court that Cabal in any mat∣ter
though never so little: To
conclude this Point, His Imperi∣al
Majesty, as a Slave to the So∣ciety,
as things stand at present,
serves only to Authorize his own
Ruin, the Ruin of his August
Family, and of the Empire in
general and particular: For the
very Moment I write, <HI>France</HI>
publickly solicits in the Empire,
(as I said before) the Nominati∣on
of a King of the <HI>Romans</HI> in fa∣vour
<PB N="67" REF="36"/>
of the Dauphin, which in
all probability will be managed
with so much dexterity and sub∣tilty,
that his Imperial Majesty,
if he follow the advice of his
Council, Spiritual or Temporal,
will think himself obliged in
Conscience voluntarily to give
way to it.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the true
state of his Imperial Majesty, and
his Council since the last Peace.
Three things remain to be con∣sidered.</P>
<P>First, The particular Advan∣tages
the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
the Jesuits procured themselves
by the late War.</P>
<P>Secondly, What Advantages
they design'd themselves by the
late Peace, and its consequences.</P>
<P>Thirdly, What the Empire
in general and particular may ex∣pect
from the present state of
Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="37"/>
The Advantages the Court of
<HI>Rome</HI> and the Jesuits procured
themselves, by the late War,
have not been so great as they
promised themselves, for God
having preserved the United
Provinces, whose utter Destru∣ction
they had projected; 'tis
certain, most of their Projects
in <HI>England,</HI> and elsewhere, were
defeated: Yet the Advantages of
the Papacy over the Protestant
Party, in the late War, are very
considerable; and consist in five
Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by the fire of War,
kindled by the Artifices of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and the Jesuits, between <HI>England</HI>
and the United Provinces; those
two Protestant Powers have un∣happily
consumed very conside∣rable
Forces in Men, Money, Ships,
Ammunition, and loss of Trade,
the Soul and Substance of the
Riches of both Countries.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="69" REF="37"/>
2. That the <HI>United Provinces</HI>
have in defence of themselves
against <HI>France</HI> and its Allies in
<HI>Germany,</HI> been forced to spend
their Men and their Money, be∣sides
loss of Trade during the
War.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Swede, Denmark,
Brandenbourgh,</HI> and <HI>Zell,</HI> have
consumed their Forces during all
this War, kindled by the Arti∣fices
of the same Party, between
<HI>Swede,</HI> and the three Princes of
<HI>Denmark, Brandenbourgh,</HI> and
<HI>Lunenbourgh,</HI> both by Sea and
Land.</P>
<P N="4">4. That under pretence of
this War, the Protestant States
of the Empire, as well during
the Campaignes as by Winter-Quarters,
have been miserably
harrassed and exhausted with
Exactions, Burnings, Contribu∣tions
to that degree, that most
of the Protestant Imperial
<PB N="70" REF="38"/>
Towns are almost ruined; and
several of them as well as the
<HI>Palatinate,</HI> and other Countries,
out of hopes of recovery in an
Age; while the Hereditary
Countries, and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and
many other places of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Communion in the Empire, have
been preserved as the Apple of
an Eye, or so little opprest they
scarce feel it.</P>
<P N="5">5. That <HI>France</HI> by this War,
having conquered the County
of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and kept it by the
Peace free from Condition of
Exchange, it is to be observ'd,
that whereas this Province, be∣longing
heretofore to <HI>Spain,</HI>
was, by reason of its distance
from the heart of that Kingdom,
not in a condition to hurt the
Protestant Cantons of the
<HI>Swisses;</HI> now that it belongs to
<HI>France,</HI> we art not to flatter
our selves, but it belongs to a
<PB N="71" REF="38"/>
Power which may every hour
make a sudden irruption into
the Canton of <HI>Bern,</HI> and under
the specious pretence of Religion
put the Protestant and Roman
Cantons in disorder, and by de∣grees
work their inevitable ru∣ine;
unless that Republick have
the Courage and Judgment to en∣ter
into confederacy with those
that ought to preserve it from
destruction, which the building
the Fortress of <HI>Hunningen,</HI> may
sufficiently instruct them, is cer∣tainly
intended them.</P>
<P>I reckon all these to be real
advantages the Court of <HI>Rome</HI>
and the Jesuits have by the last
War procur'd themselves against
the Protestant Party: For where
resolution is taken to ruine
an Enemy under several heads,
the best way to effect it, is to
divide the Powers, and engage
them as much as may be in
<PB N="72" REF="39"/>
War, one against another, to
the Consumption of their For∣ces;
and to fortifie your self on
their Frontiers, that you may
make sudden Inroads into their
Countries when you please:
The Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Je∣suits,
by the Access they have had
to the Council of <HI>France,</HI> and
the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and by the
help of the Counsellors there,
and in the Protestant Courts,
have with great dexterity put
these Maxims in practice during
the late War: For His Majesty
of <HI>Swedland,</HI> managed by <HI>France,</HI>
His Majesty of <HI>Denmark,</HI> His E∣lectoral
Highness of <HI>Branden∣bourgh,</HI>
and His Highness of <HI>Zell,</HI>
managed by the Imperial Court,
will take the pains to search
to the bottom, by what Mo∣tives
and Artifices they have
been all four engaged in a War,
which hath ruined their Estates
<PB N="73" REF="39"/>
for more than ten years. I
doubt not (with the respect and
submission that is due to them)
but they will find that the mo∣dern
<HI>Romans</HI> have with great in∣solence
and perfidiousness pra∣ctised
upon them what the anci∣ent
<HI>Romans</HI> did for divertisement
to their Gladiators: for when
these men had by bloody, and
oftentimes mortal Combats, suf∣ficiently
diverted the Spectators,
and the Magistrate made them
a Sign to give out, they were
bound to do it, and in what con∣dition
soever they were to go
every one home, as these four
Princes were in the end forced
to do. This may serve for an
excellent and important instru∣ction
for <HI>England, Holland, Swede</HI>
and <HI>Denmark,</HI> and all the Prote∣stant
States and Princes of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
to avoid effectually the
snares the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> every
<PB N="74" REF="40"/>
day lays for them the ways I
have observed, with a setled
design to destroy not only their
Religion but their Temporal
Estates.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="point">
<HEAD>The Second Point.</HEAD>
<P>The Advantages the Court of
of <HI>Rome</HI> and the Jesuits proposed
to themselves by the conclusion
of the Peace between his Impe∣rial
Majesty and <HI>France,</HI> may be
reduced to three principal
Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Maxims observed
in the first part of my Letter, to
fix (without danger of any pro∣bable
variation) the Designs of
<HI>France,</HI> and the Efforts of their
Arms, against the Empire and
Northern Countries, as most re∣mote
from <HI>Italy,</HI> and most con∣venient
by the progress of those
Arms to ruine the Prorestant
<PB N="75" REF="40"/>
Party and consequently to ad∣vance
the re-establishment of the
Papal Grandeur and Authority,
the fall of the one producing na∣turally
the exaltation of the
other. And for attaining this
end, to procure this Peace to be
so made, that his most Christian
Majesty might be fully perswa∣ded
the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and the
Jesuits (in prejudice to all other
Powers of Christendom) studi∣ed
nothing more than his exal∣tation,
and an effectual setling
and establishing in time an abso∣lute
Monarchick Authority over
<HI>Europe:</HI> And that this project
might be made appear so facil and
easie to this Prince that he might
be the better tempted to under∣take
it: In order to these ends,
the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and the Jesuits
could not have done any thing
whereby more effectually to de∣monstrate
their zeal and close
<PB N="76" REF="41"/>
adherence to the Grandeur and
Exaltation of the most Christian
King, than by making (as they
have done with so much craft
and perfidiousness) a Sacrifice of
the Emperour and Empire (with
all that concerned the Glory and
Interest of both) the better to
carry on the Designs of the
<HI>French:</HI> Their project in this
particular hath proved so effe∣ctual,
and discover'd so many
divisions, so much ignorance,
weakness, and baseness, in the
Empire, that his most Christian
Majesty may by these appea∣rances
rationally judge he may
probably succeed in whatever
he shall attempt against the Em∣pire
(though I am not of opi∣nion
he will find it so easie a
matter as he hath been made be∣lieve
'tis.) But we are to believe
this Prince is perswaded, that
to attain all his ends, the Empire
<PB N="77" REF="41"/>
being the natural obstacle against
an Universal Monarchy, it must
be his business to attempt the
Empire in the first place. Nor
can it be doubted, but the Court
of <HI>Rome</HI> and the Jesuits, making
full account the most Christian
King will be very well able by
his Forces to master the Empire,
have hastened with all diligence
possible the signing the Peace be∣tween
his Imperial Majesty and
<HI>France,</HI> upon design that his most
Christian Majesty being by this
expedient of the Peace free from
War, in case the perpetual Plots
of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the
Jesuits in <HI>England,</HI> or elsewhere,
should be so prosperous, as, with
the help of Forreign aid, to effect
the re-establishment of the Popes
Authority there, they might
make use of the <HI>French</HI> Forces
to invade that Kingdom, or other
Countries, for the ends I have
<PB N="78" REF="42"/>
mentioned: And if by Gods
Providence the perfidious and
damnable Conspiracy of the Je∣suits
against the King the Reli∣gion
and State of <HI>England</HI> had
not been discovered the last
year, I believe <HI>England</HI> had e're
this felt the Effects of what I
observe. Be pleased to allow
me leave on this occcasion to say,
that unless his Majesty of <HI>Great
Brittain</HI> be willing to fall, with
all his People, under the slavery
of the Pope, the Jesuits, and
<HI>France,</HI> he hath great Cause to
take heed left the Warlike Pre∣parations
of all sorts made by
the <HI>French</HI> in all their Ports, and
on the Coasts of the Ocean, be
not made upon some such design;
for by the Scheme of the Plot
<HI>Ireland</HI> is looked upon as a
Country which may unquestio∣nably
procure <HI>France</HI> the abso∣lute
Dominion of the Sea, and
<PB N="79" REF="42"/>
of Trade, and the Conquests of
the <HI>West Indies,</HI> according to
their ancient and primitive pro∣ject.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and
the Jesuits having that influence
over the Imperial Council, that
it was in their power to do what
they pleased there, there is no
doubt but the signing of the
Peace was prest on this farther
design, that His Imperial Maje∣sty
(the Peace concluded) find∣ing
himself in a condition to
dispose of the greatest part of his
Forces, they might easily per∣swade
him to employ them to
root out the Protestant Party in
<HI>Hungary,</HI> and perfect the pre∣tended
Reformation in <HI>Silesia:</HI>
And it was well for that People
that God provided for their
safety by very extraordinary
means, I mean the Plague; for
had not that broken out, it is
<PB N="80" REF="43"/>
not credible but <HI>Dunewald</HI> the
Apostate, now a formal Creature
of the Jesuits, had been sent
thither with an Army to do
something. Happy would it
be for His Imperial Majesty, if
by just and solid Reflections on
the Disasters successively fallen
upon his August Family, for
having too much espoused the
violent and cruel passions of the
Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and the Jesuits,
and by considering this Scourge
of God which hath forced him
to quit his Capital City, and in
a manner follows him visibly
wherever he goes, he would
be sensible the Hand of God is
not stretched out against him,
as heretofore against <HI>David,</HI> for
his Sin, but because he hath
stretched out his hand to op∣press
the only Congregations of
Christians in his Dominions,
whose Worship is not infected
<PB N="81" REF="43"/>
with Idolatry, and who accor∣ding
to the Precepts of the
Gospel adore the Soveraign
and Supreme Creator in Spirit
and in Truth. But far happier
should His Imperial Majesty be,
if by such reflections God would
give him the Grace, as he did to
the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth
before de died, to acknowledge
and own the Truth he perse∣cutes;
and (setting aside Policy)
embrace generously the Professi∣on
of it. God Almighty would
then certainly bless him, and 'tis
credible he would not deny him
the Power to humble the Proud,
and those who by their enormous.
Ambition, put all <HI>Europe</HI> into
Combustion. I beg your High∣nesses
Pardon for this Digression;
which the Matter I treat of, and
my Zeal for the Faith and Salva∣tion
of others naturally led me to.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="point">
<PB N="82" REF="44"/>
<HEAD>The Third Point.</HEAD>
<P>To make some solid Progno∣stick,
in a matter so dilicate,
I say, as to what the Empire in
general and particular is no ex∣pect
from the present state of
affairs; we are to believe his
most Christian Majesty (unless
notably changed in his dispositi∣ons)
would boldly and couragi∣ously
carry on his business, I
mean his pretension to make his
Son, the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> King of the <HI>Ro∣mans:</HI>
His Marriage with the
Princess of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the Envoys
and magnificent Presents he
sends to the Electoral Courts of
<HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI> and
his arming so furiously, signifie
sufficiently two things. First,
His Contempt of the Alliances
and Oppositions His Imperial
Majesty may make against him.
<PB N="83" REF="44"/>
Secondly, That he will certain∣ly
pursue his pretension. 'Tis of
extream importance for the Em∣pire
in general and particular to
know, whether it be for the inte∣rest
of the Empire to favour this
pretension, or to oppose it. This
with your Highnesses leave, I in∣tend
briefly to examine; and to
observe some order: It is to be
considered,</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether it be better for the
Empire in general, and every
Member of it in particular, to
live according to the ancient Cu∣stoms,
Rights and Priviledges, un∣der
which they have lived for ma∣ny
Ages; or that the Empire, with∣out
striking a blow, submit vo∣luntarily
to the Yoke of a Govern∣ment
which acknowledges no
Law, but that of a Power purely
Despotical and Absolute?</P>
<P N="2">2. As a Dependent on the
former Point, Whether it be bet∣ter,
<PB N="84" REF="45"/>
as to the Revolutions since
the Wars for Religion, that the
Empire live occording to the
Concordats and Agreements in
the Peace of <HI>Munster,</HI> or <HI>Osna∣brug,</HI>
and the last Capitulations
with His Imperial Majesty since
his Election: or without regard
to the one, or the other, that
the Empire engage anew in a
Civil War, which by a final Vi∣ctory
may decide the Quarrel in
favour of one of the parties, con∣cerning
the Concordats, and
those two Treaties of Peace, or
the late Capitulations, as if ne∣ver
agreed or capitulated?</P>
<P>I think it the more necessary
to examine before hand these
Points, for that we may hold it for
certain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="point">
<HEAD>As to the first Point.</HEAD>
<P>In case the <HI>Dauphin</HI> be ever E∣lected
<PB N="85" REF="45"/>
King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> that
from the days of that Election,
whatever Capitulations shall be
signed to the contrary, the <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
Empire will be annexed to,
and made an Hereditary Pro∣vince
of the Crown of <HI>France.</HI>
To justifie this, you need only
read several <HI>French</HI> Authors, who
have treated of the Rights and
pretensions of <HI>France,</HI> upon the
Empire, particularly that of the
Advocate <HI>Awbrey;</HI> for though
he hath with good reason been
laughed at for his Writings, yet
if that Election take effect, we
shall find his discourse solid and
well grounded. Besides, you may
soberly weigh what <HI>France</HI> hath
already practised upon that part
of the Empire which hath fallen
to its share, and the Neighbour∣ing
Parts, both in Temporals and
Spirituals: as to the Temporal
Concerns, <HI>France</HI> seizes all bold∣ly
<PB N="86" REF="46"/>
and openly in the Face of the
Sun, without pretence of other
Law, or Right, but that of con∣venience,
with as much free∣dom
and confidence, as it would
take possession of any ancient
Patrimony of that Crown: The
Dukes of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Deuxponts,
Mentbeleuard,</HI> and the Ten free
Towns of <HI>Alsatia,</HI> sufficiently
prove this; as to Spiritual mat∣ters
you need only read the pub∣lick
Ordinance of the Bishop of
<HI>Metz</HI> against the <HI>Lutherans</HI> of
those Countries.</P>
<P>For the Clergy in general, all
the free Chapters of the Empire,
whether Arch-Bishops, Bishops,
Abbots, Deans, or Priors, may
assure themselves, if this Electi∣on
take place, they must go to
<HI>France</HI> e're they come to those
Dignities; for to imagine the
free Suffrages of the Chapters
shall be continued, is sortishness
<PB N="87" REF="46"/>
and folly. The Bishopricks of
<HI>Metz, Toul</HI> and <HI>Verdun,</HI> and (I
doubt not for the future) <HI>Cam∣bray,</HI>
which were heretofore Prin∣cipalities
of the Empire, may
teach us that under a <HI>French</HI>
Government the only way to
those Dignities is by a Writ of
Presentation by the Kings, and
consequently all that seek or
depend on those Bishopricks must
be Courtiers and Slaves. Not
but that I believe if the Dauphin
be chosen King of the <HI>Romans,</HI>
his Council is too cunning not
to make him promise expresly to
maintain the Privileges and
Ecclesiastical Benefices of the
Empire: And that till he be fully
setled they may be content to
write Letters to the Chapters to
chuse the person the Court shall
recommend, but in such a man∣ner
there will be no fear of re∣fusal:
Yet this course is not to
<PB N="88" REF="47"/>
be expected to hold ten Years to
an end: Which I believe the ra∣ther
for that <HI>France</HI> pretends
(as hath been declared at large
by several politick Treatises)
that most of the great Benefices
in <HI>Germany</HI> have been founded
by Emperors, Kings of <HI>France,</HI>
and that consequently the Court
of <HI>France</HI> is the true Patron of
them.</P>
<P>The Princes of the <HI>Empire,</HI>
Ecclesiastical and temporal, of
what Rank or Degree soever,
may from the day of that Ele∣ction,
provide for three things
which will certainly follow.</P>
<P>First they shall be reduced to
the natural Rents and Revenues
of their ancient Patrimonies,
which cannot with Probability
be denied to depend upon the
ancient Kingdom of <HI>Austrasia,</HI>
(which the Ministers of <HI>France</HI>
suppose to be part of the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="47"/>
Monarchy) and consequently all
natural Rights there being sub∣ject
to the Law <HI>Salique,</HI> admit
neither of Alienation nor Pre∣scription.
For as to the Taxes
and Contributions now paid
these Lords by their Vassals and
Subjects, there is no doubt but
they will be obliged to disclaim
them, and consent with a very
good Will, that the Head of the
Empire shall in this Case Order
what Taxes and Exactions he
please to be Levied, and all for his
use: To pretend Capitulations or
Reasons to the contrary, will be
to insist on Trifles, or commence
Suits to be decided only by Mili∣tary
Execution.</P>
<P>Secondly, They will be Dis∣armed,
it being against the Ho∣nour
of the policy of <HI>France,</HI> to
permit any Prince, or Lord, un∣der
their Dominion, to have the
Power to defend himself by force,
<PB N="90" REF="48"/>
be his Right to do so never so an∣cient
and authentick.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To gain the favour
of the Head of the <HI>Empire,</HI> the
Head of every House of the Se∣cular
Princes must actually wait
on His Imperial Majesty at an
excessive Expence, or send in his
stead his Brothers or Sons to
make his Court, or to receive
Orders and Caresses, and some∣times
Repulses and Checks: And
the Empire being full of Divi∣sions
and Jealousies, there is cause
enough to fear the Princes will
strive who shall be most Offici∣ous,
as the Princes and other
Great men of <HI>France</HI> have done,
to their utter Ruin, and total
Consumption of their Estates.</P>
<P>As for the Counts, and Barons,
and all Gentlemen of the <HI>Empire,</HI>
who are Vassals to Electors and
particular Princes, my Heart
bleeds to think how certainly
<PB N="91" REF="48"/>
and strangely their Condition
will be chang'd, if ever a <HI>French</HI>
King be made Emperour. Is it
probable the Ministers of <HI>France</HI>
will have more pity of the <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
Nobility and Gentry, than
the Dukes, Marquesses, Counts,
Barons and particular Nobility of
their own Country have found at
their hands? There is no doubt
but the day they change their
Master, they must bid an Eter∣nal
Adieu to all their Rights of
Soveraign Justice and Free-hold:
The Great Men and private Gen∣try
of <HI>France,</HI> several of whom
have the Honour to be descended
in a right Line from Soveraign
Princes, had no less Courage, nor
were heretofore less Priviledged,
nor less Jealous of their Rights,
than many of the Body of the
<HI>Empire</HI> are at this present. Yet
have they been forc'd one after
another to submit to the Yoke,
<PB N="92" REF="49"/>
and lose all their ancient Privi∣ledges:
Nor must they think any
more (though they have right)
to lay any imposition on their
Subjects. For (as I said before
in the Article of the Princes;)
This is a sweet bit, which the ab∣solute
and Despotical Dominion
of <HI>France</HI> always reserves for it's
own Tooth. They must never
think more by Offices and Im∣ployments
under particular
Princes, or the Head of the <HI>Em∣pire,</HI>
to render themselves conside∣rable,
make their Fortunes, or
Recover their spent Estates, as
they could have done heretofore:
At least but few of them shall
be ever able to do it. For as to
particular Princes, they will in
case of a <HI>French</HI> Emperour be ab∣solutely
ruin'd, and forc'd to Re∣trench
themselves and their Fa∣milies
to a very low Condition;
and as to the Head of the <HI>Empire,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="49"/>
whoever will have Office or Im∣ployment
in his House or Courts
of Justice, must think of buying
it with ready Money, there be∣ing
not an Office or Imployment
in the <HI>French Kings</HI> House, from
the Steward of his House to the
Scullion in his Kitchen, nor in
his Courts of Justice, from that
of Chief President to the mean∣est
Serjeant, but is sold for ready
Money. So that there remains
not for the Nobility and Gentry
of the <HI>Empire,</HI> any Office or Em∣ploy,
but what must be bought,
save only the Military: But the
Nobility and Gentry of the <HI>Em∣pire</HI>
are too Judicious, (at least,
unless (as the <HI>French</HI> Proverb is)
<HI>They are willing to be taken for
Fools,)</HI> not to know they have
no reason to promise themselves
in this particular of Military
Employment, any greater Privi∣ledge
than is allow'd the ancient
<PB N="94" REF="50"/>
Nobility of <HI>France,</HI> and conse∣quently,
that to procure the fa∣vour
of the Prince or his Prin∣cipal
Ministers, they must serve
in the Wars at their own Charge,
as the <HI>French</HI> Nobility have done.
The necessary Expences of every
Office exceeding yearly, by three
fourths, the pay of the Prince:
That is, they most resolve to
consume the Bulk of their Estates
to be known at Court, and fre∣quently
spend a real Patrimony
in pursuit of vain and chimerical
hopes, which will infallibly Ruin
their Families; and bring most
of those who take these Courses
to end their lives in Languish∣ing
Griefs and cruel Repentings:
For thus it is, all the Nobility of
<HI>France</HI> serve in the Wars, and
such is the end most of them
make. If we have heard of a
<HI>Schomberg</HI> or a <HI>Ransan</HI> that be∣came
considerable in <HI>France</HI> by
<PB N="95" REF="50"/>
the Wars. Let the Nobility of
the <HI>Empire</HI> be assur'd it was but a
<HI>Lure</HI> which the Ministers of
<HI>France</HI> (who have long since
Plotted the Conquest of the <HI>Em∣pire)</HI>
thought fit to hold out to
Delude and Cheat the <HI>German</HI>
Nobility: They are like the Fires
in the Night that lead them
into <HI>Precipices,</HI> who are indi∣screet
enough to follow them:
All this I know to be true, groun∣ded
on very Authentick Me∣moirs,
and certain knowledge of
the matters I mention.</P>
<P>As for the Imperial Towns
and free Cities of the <HI>Empire,
Colmar, Schlestat,</HI> and <HI>Haguenau,</HI>
and the rest of that Rank, situate
in <HI>Alsatia,</HI> may teach their Magi∣strates
and Councils, what va∣lue
the Ministers of <HI>France</HI> put
upon their ancient Rights and
Priviledges, for those are the
things the Ministers there, or
<PB N="96" REF="51"/>
their Envoys under the name of
Commissaries or Intendants, call
in Derision Stories to make one
Sleep, Illusions, and Old Wives
Tales, that is, things nothing
worth. If ever <HI>France</HI> come to
the <HI>Empire,</HI> all the Cities of that
Order are with <HI>Metz, Toul,</HI> and
<HI>Verdun,</HI> and (last of all) <HI>Bezan∣son</HI>
to denounce and disclaim all
Rights of Justice, Magazines,
Garrisons and Impositions, and
to prepare themselves (at least all
those that cannot, will be kept
under otherwise) to see built in
the highest place in the Town a
strong Citadel at their Charge,
and a Garrison put into it, which
they must maintain, and conse∣quently
by degrees undergo, as
well as all the Subjects of Princes,
Earls, Barons, and particular
Lords; and all Counts, Barons,
and private Lords for their Estates
in Land and all Necessaries for

Frontiers of the Provinces, upon
passing out of one into another,
within the Kingdom. And we
may expect the like Exactions to
<PB N="102" REF="54"/>
be established in the several Pro∣vinces
of the Empire, on several
pretences.</P>
<P>All these Subsidies, and many
others, (which, to avoid Prolixi∣ty,
I pass over in silence) are one
way or other punctually paid,
where-ever any Subjects of the
<HI>French</HI> Monarchy live, with no
other distinction, but that the
Lords and Gentlemen have Right
to hold free from Imposition so
many Acres of Land, for their
Maintenance, as may be Hus∣banded
with two Yoke of Oxen,
(provided the Owner hold that
Estate in Demean) for as to
what is let out to Farmers, as
they pay the King Taxes for the
profit of the Farms, they pay so
much the less Rent to the Land∣lord;
so that in effect the Noble∣man
in <HI>France</HI> pays Taxes as well
as the Boor: Which the Princes,
the Nobles, the Magistrates, and
<PB N="103" REF="54"/>
Subjects of the Empire, of what
Degree soever, have reason se∣riously
to consider. For, 'tis folly
to fancy they can make their Ca∣pitulations
so advantageous as
to exempt them from paying
these intollerable Subsidies. The
Provinces of <HI>Guienne, Languedoc,
Provence, Dauphine, Bourgundy,</HI>
and <HI>Britain,</HI> and most of the
other Provinces of <HI>France,</HI> had
herefore their particular Prin∣ces,
as most of the Provinces of
the Empire now have; and the
principal Cities and Towns in
these Provinces of <HI>France,</HI> had
then as great Priviledges and Im∣munities
as any Free Towns of
the Empire: But the Kings of
<HI>France</HI> having invaded all these
Principalities, and seized the Li∣berties
of the Cities, have, since
the taking of <HI>Rochel,</HI> reduced
them into so absolute Slavery,
that the Citizens and Inhabi∣tants
<PB N="104" REF="55"/>
have quite lost the Resoluti∣on
and Generosity to endeavour a
Recovery of their Liberties, and
are so bridled with strong Garri∣sons
and Citadels (and we may ex∣pect
the like in all Countries of
the Empire, if ever under a <HI>French</HI>
Government) that they are not in
a condition to stir, at least to any
considerable purpose.</P>
<P>This may suffice for the first
point: I pass to the Second.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="point">
<HEAD>The second Point.</HEAD>
<P>This deserves the more exact
consideration, for that if ever
the <HI>Dauphin</HI> be chosen King of
the <HI>Romans,</HI> since the Court of
<HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> by the im∣portant
Services these have done
the Crown of <HI>France</HI> of late,
and promise to do for the future,
and the Cardinalships they flatter
the Nephews and Relations of
<PB N="105" REF="55"/>
the principal Ministers of <HI>France</HI>
with the hopes of, do what they
please in the Council of <HI>France;</HI>
and what is published to the
contrary, on the account of <HI>Re∣galities,</HI>
now in controversie, is
but Cheat and Illusion; the cru∣el
persecution raised and carried
on some years last past against
the Protestants of that Kingdom,
the disgrace of <HI>Pompone,</HI> being
not of their Cabal, and of <HI>Thea∣tin</HI>
the Princess of <HI>Brvaria</HI>'s
Confessor, intimating sufficiently
the extraordinary Credit that So∣ciety
hath in the Court of
<HI>France:</HI> I say, if ever the <HI>Dau∣phin</HI>
be elected King of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
the Empire is to expect
two things. First, To see him
at the Head of the best Forces of
<HI>France,</HI> (upon the specious pre∣tence
of Religion, and restoring
the Estates belonging to the
Church) undertaking in the Em∣pire
<PB N="106" REF="56"/>
aganst the Protestant Party
what <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>
the Second attempted to
execute. Secondly, That this affair
will be so obstinately fomented &amp;
protected by the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI>
that the Empire will be in dan∣ger
to be involved in a War
more cruel, more bloody, and
dangerous, than any the former
Wars raised for that Cause. And
there is reason enough to be∣lieve,
that the late War, as well
as the Peace since made, were
hatched and carried on by the
Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> in hopes of be∣ing
able, by the Power of the
<HI>French</HI> Forces, to work the en∣tire
Ruin of the Protestant Par∣ty
of <HI>Europe,</HI> which we see every
day decay by degrees: And I
am much mistaken if the Mo∣ney
sent by the Pope into <HI>Poland</HI>
was not design'd for a Project of
this nature. Prince <HI>William</HI> of
<PB N="107" REF="56"/>
<HI>Furstenberg</HI> might, if he pleased,
furnish us with clear Evidence
of authentick <HI>Memoirs</HI> to this
purpose; but we are not to ex∣pect
it from him, lest by such a
Discovery he lose the Recom∣pence
the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> designs
him for the Pains he hath taken,
and continues, to bring to effect
this Popish Project in the Em∣pire,
and consequently in all
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>By what hath been said, your
Highness may see the Fortune of
the Empire, if ever it fall (by any
means whatever) under the in∣tolerable
Yoke of the Despotical
Government of <HI>France:</HI> And I
think I need say no more to con∣vince
every Member of the Em∣pire,
and all the States of it in
general, (without any great
depth of Policy, or knowledge
of War) what their Duty to Re∣ligion,
their Glory and Interest
<PB N="108" REF="57"/>
oblige them to do, for preserving
themselves from falling under a
Yoke of that nature.</P>
<P>But to preserve themselves
effectually from this Yoke, I
conceive it extremely considera∣ble
to enquire first, Whence all
this Mischief proceeds? Which
known, will give us light what
must further be done: And par∣ticularly,
from what Part the
first Attack may be expected,
and what Defence is to be made.</P>
<P>The Mischiefs I have mentio∣ned
unquestionably have their
rise from the Designs and Fo∣mentations
of the Court of <HI>Rome</HI>
and the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who (at present
at least) direct and dispose of the
<HI>French</HI> Projects and Forces, and
without any Mercy or Respect,
pretend, with the Assistance of
those Forces, and their own se∣cret
Managements of Affairs, to
sacrifice all to the Re-establish∣ment
<PB N="109" REF="57"/>
of the Papal Grandeur.</P>
<P>I conceive in Right and Ju∣stice
two things are to be done;
but I doubt much whether the
one will be. The first is, That
since the Publick Good and Safe∣ty
of the Empire consists in li∣ving
(without Innovation) ac∣cording
to the Ancient Rights,
Immunities, and Privelidges, and
the Concordats established by
Law, (which every Member of
the Empire is obliged to observe)
and that the Pretensions of the
Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Jesuits,</HI>
are as inconsistent as those of
<HI>France,</HI> with the Publick Good
and safety of the Empire: Eve∣ry
Member of the Empire, with∣out
flattering themselves any
longer with hopes of Favour
from <HI>Rome</HI> or from <HI>France,</HI> and
without distinction of Religion,
applying themselves seriously to
procure and promote the Preser∣vation
<PB N="110" REF="58"/>
and Publick Good of the
Empire, should without delay
take such Measures, that neither
the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Jesuits,</HI>
nor <HI>France,</HI> may attain their
Ends. And in order to this,
That every Member of the Em∣pire
should put it self into a Po∣sture
and Condition, by uniting
their Forces, to oppose Force to
Force: And if the Princes of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Communion will <HI>Bona
fide</HI> engage in this Union, it will
be necessary, first, That his Im∣perial
Majesty find means to
gain the Amity and Assistance
of the three Northern Princes
whom I have formerly mentio∣ned,
engag'd in War by his
means, and afterwards cruelly
abandon'd to the Mercy of
<HI>France</HI> and of <HI>Swede:</HI> Which (by
the small Intelligence I have of
Affairs) will be difficult enough
to effect, especially with the Ele∣ctor
<PB N="111" REF="58"/>
of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI> without
giving him satisfaction in two
Points, on which he doth with
much equity insist. Secondly,
That his Imperial Majesty gain
over to the Interests of the Em∣pire
the Forces of the Crown of
<HI>Swede;</HI> which will be no easie
Task. Thirdly, That the Em∣perour,
and all the Princes of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Communion in the Em∣pire,
banish and root out of their
Councils not only all <HI>Jesuits</HI>
and <HI>Monks,</HI> (who by themselves
or their Superiors have all Re∣sort
to their General at <HI>Rome)</HI>
but every one that any way de∣pends
on, or hath Society with
these Hypocrites, or rather Free
Spies of the Empire; a <HI>Capuchin</HI>
in this particular being as bad as
a <HI>Jesuit.</HI> Though this be abso∣lutely
necessary, as matters now
stand, yet (to speak freely) I very
much doubt whether the Princes
<PB N="112" REF="59"/>
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion will
have the Generosity and Cou∣rage
to do it.</P>
<P>The Second, and that I take
to be the only solid means, is,
That the <HI>Protestant</HI> Party being
now clearly convinc'd that they
are the sole Persons aim'd at, and
that all that hath been done since
the beginning of the last War
was really in order onely to
work their Destruction; all
Kings, Princes, and Magistrates
of that persuasion are every one
in his Sphere to apply them∣selves
with all industry and vi∣gour,
first, To Arm with all their
Power, that they may be able
to oppose Force to Force: Se∣condly,
To enter into mutual
Leagues and Alliances, that by
joynt Strength they may resist
Forces so considerable as those of
<HI>France,</HI> and others the Court of
<HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Jesuits</HI> may by
<PB N="113" REF="59"/>
their Artifices bring over to that
party. To begin so great and
necessary a Work, we will for a
while leave the Territories of
the Empire; and looking abroad,
I am of opinion that <HI>England</HI>
and the <HI>United Provinces</HI> ought
without further delay to use all
means possible to enter into a
League Offensive and Defensive,
which may (if possible) be indis∣soluble;
That <HI>Denmark</HI> and
<HI>Swede</HI> are to follow that Exam∣ple;
and, That all the <HI>Protestant
Princes</HI> and States of the Empire,
with the <HI>Protestant</HI> Cantons of
the <HI>Swisses</HI> and the <HI>Grisons,</HI> ought
to do the like: For, 'tis not a
Concern of particular Quarrels
and Jealousies, but the Faith, the
Religion and Temporal Estates
of all the <HI>Protestant</HI> Party are
now at stake. This I conceive
will be more easily effected in
this Conjuncture, for that by a
<PB N="114" REF="60"/>
special Providence of God there
is no War at present between
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> nor be∣tween
<HI>Swede</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> nor
between the Princes of the <HI>Pro∣testant</HI>
Communion in <HI>Germany.</HI>
If these three things be effected,
and the particular Leagues incor∣porated
into a General, and con∣sequently,
an intire Union of the
<HI>Protestants of Europe,</HI> we need
not fear the Designs or Attempts
of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> or the <HI>Jesuits,</HI>
or the Council and Forces
of the <HI>French:</HI> for (these things
effected) we shall have power e∣nough
not only to deliver the
Empire from all just apprehensi∣ons
of the Designs of the Court
of <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI>
against its Liberties, but to reduce
his <HI>Most Christian Majesty</HI> (by way
of justice &amp; right) to keep himself
modestly within the Frontiers of
his Kingdom, and (in case of Re∣fusal)
<PB N="115" REF="60"/>
to do something more;
which would infallibly produce
a sure and general Peace.</P>
<P>I am the more induced to be
of this Opinion, while <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Holland</HI> on the one hand,
and <HI>Swede</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> on the
other, are labouring to put an
end to all former Quarrels; and
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Princes and Magi∣strates
of the Empire endeavour
(as I suppose) a League with the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Cantons and the <HI>Gri∣sons,</HI>
that (to say the truth) I see
no other solid and effectual
Means to defend the Empire
from the Oppression of <HI>France,</HI>
and the <HI>Protestant</HI> Party in par∣ticular
from the Oppression of
the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Jesuits,</HI>
and <HI>France,</HI> all at once: For, (to
rid our Hands of all false Max∣ims
at once) What else can the
Empire and <HI>Protestant</HI> Party rea∣sonably
ground their Safety up∣on?
<PB N="116" REF="61"/>
Will they ground it on His
Imperial Majesty, as they ought,
and without doubt might have
done, had his Council been gui∣ded
with right and sound Max∣ims?
I cannot think, after all
that his Council have caused him
to do publickly, and what he
still continues to put in Executi∣on
against the <HI>Protestant</HI> party,
that any rational person of that
party can expect the least Fa∣vour
on that side, at least as long
as the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and Court of <HI>Rome</HI>
have that Credit, that Counte∣nance
and Support they have
now in his Court. And that we
have little reason to hope this
Prince will rid himself of them,
who have dangerously corrup∣ted
his Understanding and Rea∣son,
by their Education of him,
and the prejudices instilled into
him. And should the <HI>Protestants</HI>
on this occasion expect help
<PB N="117" REF="61"/>
from the Court of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> as
their Interest in the Empire ob∣liges
them, we may very well
imagin the expectation will be
vain, if we consider the late
strict Alliance of that Court
with <HI>France,</HI> or the ridiculous
Monastick Bigotry reigning in
that Court. If then you will
rely on the Ecclesiastical Prin∣ces,
who knows not their Dis∣ability,
and that the greater
part of them will do nothing but
what the <HI>Jesuits</HI> shall insinuate in∣to
them?</P>
<P>So that for the future (as well
as the time past, at least, for the
last Age, and more) the Natural
Defence of the Empire hath (un∣der
God) no solid Ground, but
the Forces and Industry of the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Party. It was that
Party saved it from the intended
Oppression of the House of <HI>Au∣stria</HI>
in former times: And in
<PB N="118" REF="62"/>
the late War, when <HI>France</HI> at∣tempted
to Master it by its
Arms and Intrigues, it was the
same Party not only preserved
the Empire, but the Emperor,
from the Yoke of the <HI>French.</HI>
And it will be the same Party
which (by the Grace of God)
shall easily preserve it for the
future; at least, if the Potentates
of that Party, or the greater
part of them, apply themselves
to do what I conceive they are
obliged to.</P>
<P>But to speak plainly, and make
appear the necessity of such a <HI>Pro∣testant</HI>
League and Confederacy,
we are to consider; His Imperial
Majesty will either effectually
perform what he ought in de∣fence
of the Empire, by saving
himself from falling under the
Dominion of <HI>France;</HI> or that he
will do nothing but in shew and
appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="62"/>
If His Imperial Majesty per∣form
as he ought, against the En∣terprises
of <HI>France,</HI> such a League
can never be more seasonably
made to second the Imperial
Forces; nor can His Imperial Ma∣jesty
in that case rely on any For∣ces
(the Nature of the Quarrel
considered) that will be more
true to him than those of the
<HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>But if His Imperial Majesty
intend meerly to look on, as
unconcerned, and not to engage
really and effectually against the
<HI>French</HI> Designs, which he is so
highly concerned to oppose,
there can be no doubt, but the
Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>Jesuits</HI>
have secretly carried on a close
Intelligence and private League
between their Imperial and Most
Christian Majesties, for the Ruin
and Destruction of the <HI>Prote∣stant</HI>
Party; and, That by some
<PB N="120" REF="63"/>
private and mysterious Stipulati∣on,
some <HI>Protestant</HI> Estate in the
Empire, or on the Frontiers, in
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> or <HI>Swisserland,</HI>
is, according to their Project, de∣signed
a Recompence to the Duke
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> for the Dukedoms of
<HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Barre,</HI> which <HI>France</HI>
hath taken from him, and hath
no mind to restore. And by a
captious Contrivance of this na∣ture,
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Party in the
Empire shall find it self at once
assaulted by the united Forces of
their Imperial and most Christi∣an
Majesties (who are both of a
Communion.) I leave to your
Highness to judge, how much it
concerns the <HI>Protestant</HI> party, by
the Industry and Union I have
mentioned, to prevent so great
and dangerous an Inconveni∣ence.</P>
<P>My Suspicion of His Imperial
Majesty is the greater, for that
<PB N="121" REF="63"/>
it is notorious there are in the
Society of <HI>Jesuits</HI> Men of several
sorts; some of whom are dispen∣ced
with not onely to lay aside
the Habit of their Order, but to
Marry, and bear all sorts of Of∣fices
and Dignities: And that if
his Imperial Majesty was in his
younger days, out of too great
a zeal for his Religion, unhappi∣ly
engag'd in this Order, under
the Dispensations I suppose, there
is no cause left for wonder at his
Proceedings against the <HI>Prote∣stants:</HI>
For, though he had been
but of the <HI>Lower Order,</HI> which
is that wherein Marriage is per∣mitted,
and a Capacity allowed
of bearing Offices and Dignities;
yet as to all other things, and
particularly in matters of Reli∣gion,
he must have been under
the Obedience of the General of
the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and consequently
obliged to make Peace and War,
<PB N="122" REF="64"/>
as the General of the Society
should judge most convenient
for the Interest of the Pope and
the Society. The continual War
this Prince makes against the
<HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>Ʋpper Hungary,</HI>
contrary to all the Maxims and
Rules of sound Policy, and con∣trary
to the Priviledges (one of
his Ministers told me, and I am
otherwise well assured) he hath
sworn to that Nation; the vast
Gifts he hath bestowed on the
Society in <HI>Bohemia, Silesia, Hun∣gary,
Moravia,</HI> and generally in
all his Hereditary Countries;
with his shameful signing the
late Peace, in prejudice, and con∣trary
to all his Treaties with the
<HI>Protestant</HI> Princes, smells rankly
of an Obedience which acknow∣ledges
no Obligation, nor owns
any Rule of Justice or Piety, o∣ther
than the absolute Command
of his Superior. And I see no∣thing
<PB N="123" REF="64"/>
in this Prince, as to his
manner of Living, and constant
Attendance at <HI>Jesuitical</HI> Come∣dies,
Musick, and Pilgrimages,
sometimes to one Relique, some∣times
to another, with all that
may make out his natural or ac∣quir'd
inclinations, that may a∣ny
way convince this Opinion of
mistake.</P>
<P>So that if it be so, (as to speak
the truth) I very much suspect
it is; and I am not alone in this
Suspicion: I leave it to the Judg∣ment
of the Empire in general,
and the Protestants in particu∣lar,
what ground they have to re∣lie
on, or expectany Succour or
Assistance from the Head of the
Empire: For, in case this prove
true, should his Imperial Maje∣sty
promise and design effectual∣ly
to assist the Protestants, in de∣fence
of the Common Liberty;
yet if on the morrow the Gene∣ral
<PB N="124" REF="65"/>
of the Society should order
him, for some greater Good,
(which, according to their Max∣ims
consists frequently in a Mas∣sacre,
a Poysoning, or Assassina∣tion)
to joyn at a precise Day
and place his Arms to those of
<HI>France,</HI> for the entire extirpation
of the Protestant Party in the
Empire, there is no doubt but
this Prince would be obliged to
do it, either on the account of
Obedience due to his General,
or for fear the Society, in case of
his disobedience, should dispatch
him, as they did by themselves,
or their Emissaries, <HI>Henry</HI> the
Third and Fourth in <HI>France,</HI> Don
<HI>Carlos</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> of
<HI>Weymar</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and lately
the Illustrious Princess of <HI>In∣spruck,</HI>
second Wife of that Prince,
the last Duke of <HI>Brieg</HI> in <HI>Silesia:</HI>
or as they have newly attempt∣ed
to do against his Majesty of
<PB N="125" REF="65"/>
<HI>Great Britain.</HI> For Incendiaries,
Assassins, and Murderers are the
faithful Servants and inseparable
Instruments of that blessed Socie∣ty.
Your Highness will not be
surpriz'd at the vehement Suspi∣cion
I have exprest of his Impe∣rial
Majesty, when you have
considered, there have been two
Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> of that Order,
and that <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of
<HI>Spain</HI> did (out of Policy) cause
himself to be enrolled amongst
them. But the Order of the <HI>Je∣suits</HI>
is compos'd (as others) of
two sorts of People, whom Poli∣ticians
distinguish by the Names
of <HI>Directors</HI> and <HI>Directed:</HI> And we
are to observe, the two Kings of
<HI>Poland</HI> were in this latter Class.
The former, by promoting too
zealously the Passions of the So∣ciety,
having lost the Kingdom
of <HI>Swede,</HI> to which he was Heir;
and the second having by the
<PB N="126" REF="66"/>
same means incurred the irrecon∣cileable
hatred and aversion of
the Nobility of <HI>Poland,</HI> to so
extream a degree, that to avoid
the threatning effects of it, he
was forced at last to quit his
Crown, from a Sovereign to be∣come
a Subject, and go end his
days in a strange Country, with
no better a Character than that
of <HI>Abbot of St. German</HI> in <HI>France.</HI>
But as for <HI>Philip</HI> the Second (set∣ting
matter of Conscience aside)
considering him only in quality
of a Politician▪ I boldly assign
him a Place in the Class of <HI>Di∣rectors;</HI>
for he <HI>directed</HI> his Af∣fairs
so well, he mist but little of
subduing <HI>France,</HI> and effectually
seised the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI>
and the <HI>East-Indies</HI> as an Appur∣tenant.
I am oblig'd, by the
Respect I bear his Imperial Ma∣jesty,
to leave it to your High∣ness
to think which of the two
<PB N="127" REF="66"/>
Classes he is to be rank'd in.</P>
<P>But whether his Imperial Ma∣jesty
be a Member of this Socie∣ty,
or not, I have said enough to
make appear to your Highness
the absolute necessity of a
League and Consederacy be∣tween
the Protestant Powers of
<HI>Europe,</HI> to enable them to defend
themselves against the pernici∣ous
Designs of their Enemies. I
will conclude with minding
your Highness, That this is the
Occasion that calls upon you,
to shew to all the World your
zeal for your Religion, and the
Good of the Publick; And that
since my longer stay in this
Court will be useless, your
Highness will do me the Favour
to permit me to leave it as soon
as may be, that I may have the
honour to wait on your Most
Serene Person, and continue the
performance of my most humble
<PB N="128" REF="67"/>
Services. To that happy time
I respite acquainting you with
many Particulars I dare not trust
to Paper, (though altogether
confirming what I have most
confidently affirmed, as to the
most Essential Points of my
Letter.) And in hopes to re∣ceive
speedily the honour of
your Commands to that pur∣pose,
which I humbly beg, I re∣main
with all due Respects,</P>
