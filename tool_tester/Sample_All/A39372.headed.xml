<HEAD>TO THE TRULY
RELIGIOUS and LOYAL
GENTRY
OF THE
Church of England▪</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Honor'd Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the writing of my other Letter, I have seen a
Book Entitled <HI>The Popish Royal Favorite;</HI> by which
the Author <HI>William Prynne</HI> endeavors with might and
main to expose that Blessed Prince KING <HI>CHARLES</HI>
the First to the <HI>Odium</HI> of the People, for the practise of that <HI>Chri∣stian
Lenity</HI> towards the <HI>Papists,</HI> which (as he that <HI>searcheth
the Heart and tryeth the Reins</HI> knows,) has ingag'd Me in this
Design; and methinks the <HI>Blood</HI> of that Glorious Monarch <HI>Cries</HI>
to Me, and to all others that venerate His Sacred Memory, to
declare our Desires of the Abrogation of those Rigorous Laws:
For manifest it is by this very Book, that those Laws were the
occasion of the <HI>destructive Animosity</HI> of the People against their
<HI>Sovereign</HI> and the Lord Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> That His
Gracious Majesty upon a Principle of <HI>Divine Clemency,</HI> did take
great care and pains to preserve not only many <HI>Priests</HI> from
Death by the Execution of those Laws, but also many other
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<HI>Papists</HI> from utter Ruin, as to their Estates. This <HI>William Prynne</HI>
has abundantly declar'd with an <HI>Intention</HI> to asperse but as to
the <HI>Event,</HI> to the immortal Honor of that Pious Prince: But
so far the intention of this <HI>Pristerian Agitator</HI> took Effect, that
he strengthned the Hands of the basest of Traitors, to the
shedding of the Blood of their Most Gracious <HI>Sovereign▪</HI> 
<Q>p 57. All the Parliaments during His Majesties Reign (says this
<HI>mischievious Scribler,</HI>) till now, urging the Execution of Old
Laws against Recusants, Priests, Jesuits; and endeavoring to
make new strict Acts against them, have (contrary to the
practice of all former Ages) been broken up, and dissolv'd
in discontent.</Q></P>
<P>Such <HI>Fire-brands</HI> as this thrown amongst the People, made
them <HI>run</HI> out of their wits, to the most Prodigious <HI>Enormities</HI>
that the World ever saw, but when the <HI>Sun</HI> withdrew his Light.
I beseech you by the <HI>meekness and gentleness</HI> of Our Lord <HI>Iesus
Christ,</HI> to consider the <HI>Anti-Christianism</HI> of this <HI>William Prynne</HI>
and his <HI>Complices,</HI> in this one instance of His Majesties <HI>Most
Christian</HI> compassion towards the <HI>Papists;</HI> for which those <HI>Pha∣natical</HI>
Men so <HI>clamor'd</HI> against him, <HI>Viz.</HI> His Gracious An∣swer
to this most reasonable Petition.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Humble Petition of Robert Courtese, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MOst humbly shewing, That whereas the Petitioners have
lately exhibited a Petition unto your Majesty, de∣claring
that for being Recusants, there are Writs out of your
Highness Court of Exchequer, directed to the Sheriffs of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> to seize their Goods to Your Majesties
use: Albeit, they have been always, and now are ready to
compound according to Your Majesties most Gracious Fa∣vor;
and their mean Ability (being poor Trades-men,) which
by reason of this contagious time, and other the weighty Af∣fairs
of Your Majesties Most Honorable Commission, they have
not yet done, and so stand in danger to perish, unless Your Ma∣jesty
of your accustomed Clemency do extend your gracious
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
favor towards them, in giving order that the said Writs may
be staid, which they most humbly pray. Since which time
they humbly shew there are no other Writs come out of the
Crown-Office to arrest their Persons.</P>
<P>Therefore they do most humbly beseech your Majesty to
take compassion of them and their poor Estates, and to give
order that the said Writs may be staid, and that they may not
be molested neither in their Persons or Goods, whilst they
are upon composition with your Majesty, which they will
endeavor to hasten with as much speed as may be:</P>
<P>And as by duty bound, your poor Petitioners shall daily pray
for Your Majesty long to Reign most happily over us.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>At the Court at Oatelands, 7 August 1637.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Majesties pleasure is, that the Writs shall be staid,
according to the desire of the Petitioners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Fran. Windebank.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Now let us see how this Blood-thirsty Man stirs up the <HI>Beast
with many Heads,</HI> to destroy the Lord Arch-Bishop of <HI>Can∣terbury.</HI></P>
<P><Q>They had (says he,) the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury, Wren,
Montague, Cosin,</HI> with many other Prelates and Priests to
introduce and establish their Popish Doctrins.</Q> To make way
for the reception of this Lye, he had spoken of the Arch-Bishops
endeavors to protect some Priests from the force of the Laws,
which is as probably true, as what he would prove by it, is cer∣tainly
False. Here you see that the same <HI>Spirit</HI> which is so
<HI>bloodily</HI> set against the <HI>Papists,</HI> would have all those to pass
for <HI>Papists</HI> who joyn with them in a due <HI>Veneration</HI> of the
<HI>Ancient Fathers,</HI> and acknowledge the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> (up∣on
account of their acknowledging the H. <HI>Scriptures</HI> to be the
Word of God, and of their Profession to adhere to the <HI>Four
General First Councils,</HI> &amp;c.) to be a <HI>True Church.</HI> This was the
Crime of those Great Men, <HI>Laud, Wren, Montague, Cosin.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
And here I shall beseech you to consider, whether if the <HI>Church
of</HI> Rome <HI>be a True Church,</HI> (as all the True Sons of the <HI>Church
of England</HI> have ever acknowledg'd;) we are not bound by our
<HI>Christianity</HI> to exercise towards Persons of that <HI>Communion,</HI>
not only <HI>Common Charity,</HI> but <HI>Brotherly Love?</HI> And since there
is not a <HI>Papist</HI> in any of His Majesties Dominions, that de∣nies
that our Gracious Sovereign has as undoubted a Right to
the <HI>Crown</HI> he possesses, as any Man living to any of his Pos∣sessions;
do's not the profession of <HI>Brotherly Love</HI> oblige us
to desire the <HI>Abrogation</HI> of those <HI>Rigorous Laws?</HI> There are no
such Laws against the <HI>HOBBISTS</HI> or <HI>SOCINIANS,</HI>
neither do I desire there ever should be; and yet I am sure there
is not one of you will say that we owe any <HI>Brotherly Kind∣ness</HI>
to those <HI>Monsters.</HI> A learned <HI>Papist</HI> (who I suppose is still
living in this Kingdom,) has done that Service to the <HI>Church
of England,</HI> and indeed to the <HI>Whole Church of Christ,</HI> as to
publish a compleat Confutation of the <HI>Fundamental Error of the
LEVIATHAN,</HI> Viz. That there can be no <HI>Idea</HI> or <HI>intellectual
Representation</HI> of an <HI>Infinite Being,</HI> or (to deliver it in <HI>T. H's</HI>
own words,) that <Q>A Man can have no Thought representing
any thing not subject to Sense.</Q> Now, what a grievous thing
would it be to the Heart of any learned sincere Christian, to
see <HI>Hobbists</HI> or <HI>Socinians</HI> insulting over so excellent a Person
as a <HI>Criminal,</HI> &amp;c. And as for the <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> of the
Communion of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> we find most of them to
be very ingenious and of generous Education: And is it not
pity that there should be such Distance betwixt Us and Them,
as to Moral Friendship and Civil Conversation, that we must
be thought to desire that they should be still expos'd to the
danger of being <HI>Hang'd</HI> or <HI>Banish'd;</HI> and that for what, as I
have prov'd, do's not exclude them from a Right to Our <HI>Bro∣therly
Love?</HI> have not many of them been the instruments
of the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> in suppressing the late Rebellion? And
many more would have hazarded their Lives in that Service,
if they had been permitted to have joyn'd themselves with Our
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
Forces. And is it not a sad thing to think that Men of <HI>Tray∣terous</HI>
and <HI>Rebellious Principles,</HI> (for surely <HI>the Kings Pardon</HI>
has not yet made them all Converts,) should live in hopes
that one day they may see these Men <HI>Hang'd</HI> or <HI>Banish'd,</HI>
who were so instrumental to defend Us against their <HI>Vio∣lence?</HI>
I said in my other Letter, that the <HI>Abrogation</HI> of those
Laws would contribute to the Peace and Tranquility, the
ease and comfort of the Government of a Protestant Succes∣sor;
that I had reason to say so▪ may be easily discern'd in
the Reflections I have made upon the <HI>Seditious</HI> and <HI>Trayterous</HI>
Practices of <HI>William Prynne,</HI> grounded upon the pretence of
his proving the <HI>King</HI> to be a <HI>Papist,</HI> because the <HI>Lenity</HI> and
<HI>Meekness</HI> of His <HI>Heroick Spirit,</HI> would not permit him to
<HI>Kill</HI> or <HI>Banish,</HI> or <HI>totally</HI> to impoverish those Men whom He
really thought to be some of His <HI>Loyal Subjects.</HI> Can we sup∣pose
that any of His Posterity will not follow the blessed
Example of His Glorious Clemency, the true property of a
<HI>Great Spirit?</HI> or can we suppose that those <HI>infernal Heats</HI>
which instigated <HI>William Prynne</HI> and his Fellows, will be to∣tally
extinguish'd in the Third or Fourth Generation? And
if not, may not the like <HI>Fatal Iealousies</HI> and <HI>Suspitions</HI> upon
the same Grounds be rais'd against any of His Majesties <HI>Heirs</HI>
or <HI>Successors</HI> that were rais'd against His Father? I do most
earnestly beseech you to ponder these things in your Hearts;
and to keep your Thoughts pois'd with such <HI>Equity,</HI> that up∣on
account of the <HI>Meanness</HI> of my Person, you may not make
light of the Solidity of my Assertion. Let us of the <HI>Church of
England</HI> take all occasions to make known to the World,
that we are deeply sensible of His Majesties great Clemen∣cy
and Fatherly tenderness towards us; and let us also rejoyce
in the Mercy He has shewn to His and Our Enemies; let our
chief Dependence be upon the <HI>King of Kings,</HI> not hoping for
Defence against the <HI>Papists</HI> by the <HI>Arm of Flesh,</HI> or the silent
<HI>Threats</HI> of those dreadful Laws, but by <HI>trusting</HI> in Him, <HI>by
whom Kings Reign;</HI> from whose Mercy it is that Our King
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
has oblig'd us with such gracious Promises, that it cannot be
but that common Ingenuity should suggest unto us, not only
the inclinations to yield Him all the Obedience which His
Laws require, but also the satisfaction of those <HI>Tacit Desires▪</HI>
which are so clearly and unquestionably equitable as this: That
since His Majesty do's so graciously protect Us in the Exercise
of our own Religion, we would do what in us lies to secure
Our <HI>Fellow Subjects</HI> that are of His Religion, for ever being
destroy'd <HI>by a Law</HI> for being so.</P>
<P>I lately receiv'd a Letter from one in <HI>London,</HI> who would
fain make me asham'd of my just and charitable Design. The
Man is guilty of such <HI>gross Immorality,</HI> that I do not desire
to have any private Correspondence with him; but since he
appears so pert and hot in his way, as to bring such <HI>false Ac∣cusations</HI>
against Me, who never saw or heard of Him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
That <HI>I am carryed in the stream of secular Interest,</HI> and that I
<HI>desire our Church should fall, that the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>should
stand more firm,</HI> &amp;c. 'Tis manifest he's an over-zealous Ad∣versary
to my Design, and may do some mischief with such
little shews of a <HI>Refutation</HI> of my <HI>Reasoning,</HI> as he has here
produc'd. I shall therefore let the World see what I have
to say in Reply to his pretended Refutation, tho I despise
his Calumnies.</P>
<Q><P>That single doughty Argument, by which you would
defend your confident Proposal (if I could hope that the
narrowness of an Epistle had hindred you from giving o∣thers,
it might have sav'd your Reputation,) comes to no
more than this, That if a Man is found guilty of Murder,
the Prince must not have him hang'd lest he should for∣get
his Filial Affection; or that the Law must indulge the
wild whimsies of <HI>Adamites</HI> or <HI>Muggletonians,</HI> or any other
extravagant Sect, lest (if punish'd) they shou'd not retain
a Filial Affection for their Prince, the Father of their
Country.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="5"/>
He has been pleased to save me the labor of Answering
this, by shewing the great Disparity betwixt our Loyal Fel∣low
Subjects that I plead for, and those most odious Sects
that he mentions: <Q>For he tells me that he <HI>can assent</HI> to me
in acknowledging the great Worth of many of the <HI>Popish
Religion,</HI> whom I am proud (says he) to call my Friends.</Q>
He must prove that a Man may be proud of the Friend∣ship
of some <HI>Adamites</HI> and <HI>Muggletonians</HI> too as Persons of
Great Worth, or else his Comparison comes to nothing but
<HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Impudence:</HI> I will not say it is <HI>Ridiculous,</HI> but
most <HI>Irreligious,</HI> being contrary to the <HI>Principles,</HI> not only
of <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> but of <HI>Common Humanity.</HI> Seriously,
I think very ill of the Man that makes sport of those words,
<HI>a Filial affection for their Prince, the FATHER of their
Country.</HI> I pray God to make Him and Me, and all His Ma∣jesties
Subjects always mindful of the <HI>Sacred Truth</HI> those words
do import.</P>
<P><Q>I cou'd very easily (says he,) and very sincerely too, give
a Flourish of Rhetoric in praise of His Majesties extraordi∣nary
Acts of Grace towards those who so ill deserv'd of him,
and can also assent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but that the <HI>Church of England</HI>
shou'd submit to be ridden by the Pope, to declare its meek
and lowly Temper, is a Principle very obscure to me; or
that we shou'd throw up our Religion out of a vitious Hu∣mility,
seems to be no less Ridiculous than Irreligious; but
I perceive you desire our Church shou'd fall, that the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> may stand more firm.</Q></P>
<P>Submit to be ridden by the Pope, and throw up Our Re∣ligion!
What could be spoken more to the vilifying of Our
Religion than this, That we cannot retain it if those rigorous
Laws shou'd be Repeal'd? Certainly, if it be <HI>the Truth,</HI> as I
assert it is, it would stand against the highest Storms of the
fiercest Persecution. But what fear of suffering <HI>Violence</HI> in
this Kings Reign, who do's so graciously protect Us? And
surely we should not rejoyce the less in His Protection, because
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
there is no <HI>Secular Punishment</HI> inflicted upon those that <HI>run</HI>
from us, or will not <HI>come</HI> to us. That to take off the Laws I
have mention'd, wou'd be to give up our selves to the Power
of the Pope, or to throw up our Religion is an <HI>Absurdity</HI> too
gross to be believ'd by any Man, that has but so much Common
Sense as to distinguish betwixt that <HI>Legal Force</HI> or <HI>Authority,</HI>
by which we are <HI>secur'd</HI> from the <HI>Violence</HI> of others, and that by
which we may destroy them. The <HI>Papists</HI> by the <HI>Abrogation</HI>
of those Laws wou'd have no more Power over us than they
have now, and much less <HI>provocation</HI> to <HI>Malign</HI> us. I leave it to
this Man to <HI>give a Flourish of Rhetoric;</HI> I am only for a <HI>Word
to the Wise.</HI> Tho he's pleas'd to make some <HI>Sceptical</HI> Reflecti∣ons
on those words of mine, <HI>Divine Love,</HI> and <HI>Heavenly-mind∣ed;</HI>
sure I am, there is such a <HI>Thing</HI> as a <HI>Principle of Divine Love,</HI>
which sways Me in this Undertaking; if upon daily and hour∣ly
Examination, I know any thing of the <HI>Tendency</HI> of my own
<HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Affections.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard of some <HI>Clamors</HI> against Me, as if I undertook to
vindicate the <HI>vain</HI> Pretence that some make of <HI>tender Consciences,</HI>
in that Passage in my former Epistle,—<Q>because they cannot do
what their Consciences, supported by the concurring Judg∣ments
of thousands of sober and learned Men, oblige them not
to do.</Q> I shall entreat you to consider that in those words, I
plainly suppose, that 'tis probable that a Man may be put to
death by those Laws, meerly for following the Dictates of a
<HI>real Tender Conscience,</HI> which implies such an <HI>Abhorrence</HI> from
all <HI>Known Sin,</HI> and from what a Man conceits that he certainly
knows to be a <HI>Sin,</HI> that he would die rather than do it. It can∣not
be suppos'd that a <HI>Traytor</HI> or <HI>Rebel</HI> can be such a <HI>conscienti∣ous
Man.</HI> That we ought to <HI>have a favorable regard to Tender
Consciences;</HI> this Kingdom has been <HI>admonish'd</HI> again and again,
by that incomparable <HI>Heroic Sufferer</HI> JUDGE JENKYNS.
And now I shall beseech you to consider what prodigious mad
Conceits those Men (who murther'd <HI>Arch-Bishop Laud</HI> upon
<HI>pretence of Iustice,</HI>) were driven unto by their <HI>bloody Hatred</HI> and
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
<HI>Inhumanity</HI> against the <HI>Papists,</HI> stir'd up by the <HI>confident Haran∣gues</HI>
of <HI>William Prynne,</HI> and other indefatigable Self-con∣ceited
Scriblers. Some of the <HI>Articles</HI> against the Arch-Bi∣shop,
the <HI>Accumulation</HI> whereof they <HI>feign'd</HI> to be <HI>High-Trea∣son,</HI>
were these, That his Grace enjoyn'd the <HI>saying Second
Service at the Communion Table, bowing at the Name of Iesus,
the setting of Rails about the Communion Table, standing up at</HI>
Gloria Patri. In one of the Printed Books of the <HI>Presby∣terians,</HI>
they say that it is impossible that the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>
should please God, because it pleases the <HI>Papists.</HI> Being agi∣tated
with such <HI>furious</HI> Conceits, what <HI>Hellish Contempt</HI> have
they shewn of our <HI>Sacred Liturgie!</HI> Away, they cry, with
those <HI>Rags of Popery,</HI> those <HI>Scraps of Prayer!</HI> Away with their
<HI>Gloria Patri!</HI> their <HI>Te Deum!</HI> their <HI>Three Creeds!</HI> their <HI>Epistles
and Gospels!</HI> yea, (<HI>Horresco referens</HI>) and away with the <HI>LORDS
Prayer</HI> too! the saying of the <HI>LORDS Prayer</HI> is no better than
a <HI>Charm!</HI> Thus they are so <HI>affrighted</HI> with <HI>Popery,</HI> that they
<HI>run</HI> out of their <HI>Wits,</HI> and out of their regular Profession of <HI>Chri∣stianity;</HI>
yea, some of them in plain terms defy'd the <HI>Christian
Religion,</HI> by denying the <HI>Godhead</HI> of our Blessed Saviour. What
a preparation was this for the reception of that most damnable
<HI>Heresie</HI> of the <HI>Socinians,</HI> Viz. to teach people to <HI>abhor</HI> those <HI>Forms</HI>
of <HI>sound Words,</HI> which contain the clearest Expressions that could
ever be compos'd, of the <HI>Fundamental Points of Christianity,</HI>
plainly and directly opposite to all the cursed Errors condemn'd
by the <HI>Four First General Councils.</HI> I pray God we may all have
the Grace to <HI>assent</HI> to what is <HI>True,</HI> to <HI>love</HI> what is <HI>Good,</HI> tho we
find it amongst the <HI>Papists.</HI> I shall give you no further trouble
at present, but to beseech you to joyn with Me in Praying con∣tinually
that all His Majesties Subjects may duly observe that
Injunction of the Blessed Apostle, <Q>Let your moderation
(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.) be known unto all Men. The LORD is
