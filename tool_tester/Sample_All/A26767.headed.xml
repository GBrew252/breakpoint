<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, Added by a Person of Quality, who had the care of Revisiing the Translation.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the World the Life of Man being very long, and the Transa∣ctions that happened neither great, va∣rious, nor many, there was little need of History. The Father living many hundred years with his Children and Grand∣children, had leisure and time sufficient to im∣print in their memories the story of the few Oc∣currents that were past; and no man coming then to govern any considerable number of men, till he had lived the space of three or four of our longest lives put together, was by that time abundantly furnished from his own Expe∣rience; and what had happened in his own days, with so much prudence, as might qualifie him for Government.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>But when after the <HI>Deluge</HI> the Life of Man was brought by degrees to about threescore and ten, or fourscore years, and much of the latter part of that small period became unfit for busi∣ness by sickness and other calamities of old age, and the affairs of the World grew numerous, whether considered as past, or present; then it became necessary that <HI>Memorials</HI> should be kept for the relief of humane infirmity, the per∣petuation of the memory of Actions, and that mankind, who had but a short time to live upon the Earth, might in that time be quickly and easily furnished with an artificial Experience, derived from an artificial Memory; by which Governours might be qualified for government, and Subjects disposed to a dutiful submission to the Prudence and Conduct of their Superiours: that so this short and transitory Life of Man might be rendered as wise and happy as it was possible, and that Piety too might be nourished in the minds of men by a serious reflection on the Works of Gods Providence, manifested in the several effects of his wise Conduct in the govern∣ment of the World, whereby he has in every Age demonstrated his Justice and Mercy in dealing to every man a Reward according to his Acti∣ons.</P>
<P>These were the Causes of the invention of Letters, and of writing Histories or <HI>Memoires</HI> of past Events for the use of Posterity, by those that had seen them, or were otherwise well in∣form'd concerning them. And those into whose
<PB REF="4"/>
hands these first Monuments fell, were mighty fond of them, and by often reading and deep∣ly considering them, in a short time much im∣prov'd themselves in Wisdom, Virtue, and Pie∣ty. For the first and most ancient Stories were written without any vain pomp of affected Words or Rhetorical Expressions: the Histo∣rian not courting the Applause, but labouring hard for the Improvement of the Reader: And he again repairing to those venerable Reposito∣ries, not to seek a vanishing Light, unprofitable Pleasure and Devertisement, but a solid and durable Improvement, and the Rules of living well and wisely. So there is a threefold use of History: Political, Moral, and Divine. Of all which, briefly in their order.</P>
<P>The Political use of History is twofold: first, as it relates to Governours; and then, as it re∣lates to Subjects or Inferiours.</P>
<P>The advantages Princes and Great men, who are to govern others, do or may reap from the reading of Histories well and wisely written, are innumerable; but then they are to such so well known, that I need not spend any time to remark them here; my designe not being to in∣struct my Betters, but to improve (if I may) my Equals.</P>
<P>And as to Subjects, the use of History is not much less; by which, if they would seriously reflect upon what is past, they might learn many things that would be of great use to them, and render theirs and their Governours lives more easie and happy.</P>
<P N="1"><PB REF="5"/><HI>1.</HI> For first, they might observe with what difficulties all humane Governments are beset, how often God (for causes known sometimes onely to himself) defeats the wisest contrivan∣ces and designes of men: How neighbouring Princes interpose, and cross or frustrate their undertakings, out of interest, fear, hope, envy, and the like: How often want of due instru∣ments, provisions, men, moneys, changes in the seasons; and a thousand other accidents inter∣vene and prevent their purposes.</P>
<P>Now this consideration would certainly (if men were modest and just) procure from them a due regard for their Superiours, even then when they are unfortunate, and not make every unprosperous accident that happened, the effect of sloath, negligence, carelesness, and supine stupidity. And being thus disposed, they might sometimes, at least, find the reason of publick Calamities in themselves; at others, in the ju∣stice of God punishing the sins of men; or in the neighbour Princes, or any other cause, rather than traduce and defame their Governours, and suspect their fidelity to their own Interests and Honour, which must be infinitely dear to any man of sence.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> History will teach men, that Religion and Liberty are very ill secured for the most part by Civil War and Rebellion: for as to the first, the right hand of God planted it in the World by Miracles and the effect of a mighty Providence, without Force, Wealth, Eloquence, or Policy, by
<PB REF="5"/>
the Bloud and Patience, the Meekness and sim∣plicity, the Holiness and Resignation of Saints, Martyrs, and Holy men: And as it was planted, so it must be defended, so it must be preserved.</P>
<P>But then there is nothing in the world more contrary to this method, than for Subjects to raise Tumults, encourage Insurrections, list Ar∣mies, and attempt the ruine and destruction of their Princes and fellow-Subjects, to defend this Faith; which was planted by Meekness, and watered with the blouds and tears of the Mar∣tyrs: and this, if Religion be never so appa∣rently persecuted and endeavoured to be de∣stroyed. But who can delineate the madness of perpetrating all these horrid Villanies out of meer fear &amp; jealousie Religion should be design∣ed upon, before there is one drop of Bloud spilt, or one man ruined or attempted to be ruined?</P>
<P>And as to Civil Liberty and Property, they were won from kind and good-natured Princes, by the dutiful Carriage and Civility of their Subjects. And therefore there is scarce a foot∣step of them to be found amongst those Nations that were never Civilized; and many of them have never enjoyed those rare Blessings, but in a low degree, and some scarce at all, as the anci∣ent <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>Now as there is nothing more ungrateful, than for men to turn the Favours of their Prin∣ces, or indeed of any man, into occasions of Quar∣rels and Resistance, even when there is a real cause to be concern'd for the loss of these precious
<PB REF="6"/>
and inestimable Jewels; so is there nothing more foolish, than for men to put these Darlings of theirs to nurse in Fields and Camps, reeking with the Bloud of their fellow-Subjects, sur∣rounded with Fire and Smoak amidst the roar∣ing of Cannon, the ratling of Drums, the shrikes and groans of dying men, and all that is dread∣ful to flesh and bloud; and after all to fall in∣to the hands of an enraged Prince, if he pre∣vails; and into the less-merciful clutches of their own Souldiers, if they happen to overcome their Prince. Certainly there cannot be a more impolitick Errour committed by Subjects, than to resist and rebel, when their Priviledges are really invaded: but then to do all this by way of prevention to be wheadled and cajoled into such miseries as those with the meer fears and jealou∣sies of contingent and possible designes, this is a degree of Rage beyond all other human madnesses, and can be inspired by nothing but Furies &amp; in∣croaching Devils, who take possession of the very souls of such men, as they are said to have done heretofore of some mens bodies. And there is not a more powerful Amulet against these Mi∣series, than a due observation of the Tragedies these Devils have heretofore raised in the world. The truth is, almost all the Nation are satisfied that next the Mercies of God, nothing did more contribute to our late Preservation, than the remembrance of our former Miseries: And the History of them may have very near the same effect upon our Posterity.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="6"/><HI>3.</HI> The third and last Political use of Histo∣ry, is to acquaint the World with the nature and temper of men. There is scarce any thing more difficult than for a man to know himself well; and if he did not sometimes see himself in others, he would hardly perhaps ever do it: But then who but God can pretend to know all the various, changeable, and inconstant humours, designes, and ends of the Mass of Mankind in the space of those few years we are to live? and yet if it were possible, how infinite is the danger of being mistaken and purchasing our experience at the price of our ruine?</P>
<P>But History, like a kind Mistriss, leads us by the hand into her delightful Gardens, and there reads Lectures upon every Flower, Plant, and Weed, and truly acquaints us how this and the other sped well or ill; and then assures us our Fortune will be the same, if we be not so wise as to take her word, but will be trying over again the same Experiments upon our selves or others. But above all, if we take <HI>Dema∣goues,</HI> People-drivers, the Flatterers and A∣dorers of the <HI>Many,</HI> for good men, or good friends, or in short, any man for a good Common∣wealths-man or Patriot, who is not a good loyal hearty Subject.</P>
<P>If men would thus a while consult in History the honest policy of preserving themselves and their Countries from Ruine and Confusion, they could not but observe, that <HI>Immorality</HI> was in every Age the greatest Enemy of Mankind.
<PB REF="7"/>
That Ambition, Pride, Avarice, Revenge, Lust, and Luxury, and the rest of those horrid deformities of Mortality, were the real weights which set these Machines in motion, which have torn down Empires, and ruined the most flourishing Kingdoms; and particularly have in the memory of man twice, bid fair for the ruine of ours, under two Princes of so exact a Justice, and so God-like a Clemency and Goodness, that their Subjects having no real Calamities to com∣plain of (which is a Felicity rarely given by Heaven to the best Ages) our wanton Country∣men, sick of Peace, Plenty, and Prosperity, ri∣fled the Cabinet of God Almighty, and the in∣nocent bosoms of two excellent Princes, and pre∣tended they discovered their designes of intro∣ducing Popery and Arbitrary Government. And by these <HI>Chimerical</HI> fears intoxicated and be∣wiched the poor Populace, and putting them at last in fearful Commotions, these quick-sight∣ed Privado's of Heaven, the Censors of Princes, the Darlings of the Rabble, mounted the Sad∣dle, and drove the People as the Devils did the heard of Swine down the steep Rocks of Rebel∣lion, Schism, and Treason, while they who put them into this miserable condition, reaped the Wealth, and divided the Honours and Em∣ployments of the Nation amongst them, and under the mask of a pompous Piety, were reli∣giously proud, covetous, ambitious, revengeful, insolent, treacherous, perjurous, and in a word, a parcel of the most sanctified Rogues and Tray∣tors that ever the Sun shin'd upon.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>When God Almighty reduced us out of our Hell of Misery, and <HI>Chaos</HI> of Confusion, there was no Apologie more frequent in the mouths of men than this: <HI>Who could have thought that men of such seeming Piety, of so exal∣ted and eminent a zeal for the Glory of God, the Protestant Religion, and the Liberty and Property of the Subject, that such men, I say, as these should hatch in their minds such horrid Villanies, Treasons, Rapines, Mur∣ders, Perjuries, and ambitious Projects, as we have since with astonishment seen them practise?</HI> Well, if they had wisely considered the Histories of other Countries, or of former Ages, they might easily have foreseen and pre∣vented all this Misery: for whenever men are more sollicitous for the faults of their Superi∣ours, than careful to amend their own; when they seek to win the entire love and esteem of Subjects from their Princes and Governours; let the outside be what it will, there is Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and Discontent within: and therefore such men, of all others, are never to be trusted.</P>
<P>This Thought well pursued, will lead a man home too, and give him an occasion to search his own heart, and try diligently whether he is a good and useful Member of the Civil Society in which he lives: If he is under the dominion of any of these Vices, let him never call himself a loyal Subject, or a good Patriot; for whatever his present intentions are, he will be neither,
<PB REF="8"/>
when his Interest shall lie cross to his Duty. And because it is much harder to believe ill of ones self, than of another, let History acquaint him how many men have been drawn in by their own secret, and in all probability to themselves undiscovered Vices, till beyond their first inten∣tions or thoughts, they have been swallowed up in an Abyss of horrible Crimes and Disorders; and what have betided them, may be our lot too, if we do not purge out, or at least watch the motions of these Disturbers of the World in us.</P>
<P>The Doctrines of Morality are sometimes un∣pleasant and uneasie to corrupted minds, and do not easily insinuate and obtain admission; and when they are received, do often make such slight impressions, that they vanish in oblivion and forgetfulness: but examples convey them to us with pleasure and delight, and the variety and wonderful accidents that are to be met with in all Histories, which are nothing but the imagery and various colours of Virtues and Vices embodied and made visible to us, make vived and lasting impressions on the minds of men, and stamp and engrave the Ideas of them on the fancy and memory, so that nothing but death can destroy or obliterate those impres∣sions. And this was one reason why the Anci∣ents cloathed their moral Observations in Apo∣logues, Fables, and Parables; but History ha∣ving the reality of persons, names, times, and places, do infinitely exceed these fictitious re∣presentations:
<PB REF="8"/>
and therefore as History grew up in the World, these fictitious Images of it were laid by and antiquated.</P>
<P>Examples fit all Capacities, at least some or others of them, in a vast variety; whereas Pre∣cepts can hardly be so cloathed, but some will despise the meanness of the language, or others not understand the goodness of it: whereas Ex∣amples fit themselves to all Capacities, and teach men before they are aware of it, the love∣liness of Virtue, the turpitude and baseness of Vice, and the different events which for the most part in every Age have attended them.</P>
<P>This brings me to the third particular I proposed, the divine use of History. As the World was not the Product of blind Fate or Chance, but the Work of a Great, Wise, and Holy God, who raised and built it out of No∣thing by his infinite Power, and by his Wisdom brought it into this beautiful order in which we behold and admire it: So neither did he de∣sert it when he had form'd and adorn'd it, but has ever since govern'd it with one unsearcha∣ble and irresistible Providence and Wisdom. And this not onely the inanimate and irratio∣nal part of it, but above all, his eyes are upon the children of men; and in the government, protection, preservation, rewarding and punish∣ing, exalting and abasing them, he exerciseth so steady, just, and reasonable a <HI>Providence,</HI> but withal, so abstruse, hidden, and reserved, that it exceeds the Wisdom of the greatest
<PB REF="9"/>
and wisest of men to penetrate into the reasons of it, or to foresee the events before they disco∣ver themselves in time.</P>
<P>Now in the History of the Actions and E∣vents of mankind, there is an undesigned Hi∣story of this <HI>Providence</HI> of God, which like some Rivers, sometimes run above ground plain and delightful, or terrible and instructive at the first glance; but at others, buries it self under Mountains and Hills: and though in those secret recesses it still (like those Rivers) maintains an uninterrupted course, yet can no mortal eyes pursue its streams, and observe its windings and turnings, or when and where it will break out and again discover it self, till he himself is pleased to bring it into the light a∣gain.</P>
<P>Now History has brought down an uninter∣rupted thread of the methods of Providence from the creation of the World to this day; by which, as in a Glass, we may see a representa∣tion of the Justice and Mercy of God in his dea∣lings with the sons of men, and admire that wonderful Wisdom and Power, which, without offering violence to the freedom of mens wills, has yet been able to dispose them to effect his own most holy purposes, when they least designed it; without any violence has protected Virtue against the utmost rage of Men and Devils, and preserved it through all the Ages of an ill World; and punished Vice by it self, in ways so abstruse and secret, that the Workers of Ini∣quity
<PB REF="9"/>
have been stun'd and amazed to see not onely their ill designes over-ruled, but made the Instruments of their own deserved ruine.</P>
<P>There is no one thing that hath in every Age so much staggered the belief of a divine Provi∣dence governing the World and the Affairs of Mankind, as the prosperity of wicked and lewd men, and the misery and oppression of good and virtuous men. But this Mist will vanish like smoak, when men are pleased to take a view of past Ages, and observe the <HI>Catastrophies</HI> of the several Periods and Ages: for that which may seem at one time to be all Mystery and Riddle, will by degrees open and unfold it self, till at last there will be nothing more apparent, than that God had all this while his eyes upon both the one and the other, and kept the invisible Reins in his own hands, and by ways, unpercei∣ved both by the good and bad, at last, tho not suddenly, brought them to their deserved ends, and recompenced both according to their diffe∣rent deserts; and this will give us an assu∣rance, that as it has been in past Ages, so it will be in ours; the same God is still at the Helm, and he will, as heretofore he has, conduct us al∣so to that end we have deserved, be it good or bad, without respect of persons, which will pre∣serve us in Peace and Virtue, dispel all melan∣cholly thoughts, and free us both from specula∣tive and practical temptations.</P>
<P>It is not hard to apply all I have said to the History of our Late Revolutions in <HI>England;</HI>
<PB REF="10"/>
but as I designe a Preface to a very short Hi∣story of them, and so must not be long: so the Reader will be much more instructed and better pleased to reflect upon that History, and to com∣pare it with this Preface, and then determine with himself whether these thoughts of mine up∣on this occasion are pertinent, and whether there be any thing in the following Story that will prove and illustrate the truth of what I have here said; and therefore to him I shall leave it.</P>
<P>But because these Pieces never appeared be∣fore in <HI>English,</HI> may I have the Readers leave to give him a short account of the designes of them.</P>
<P>The Author of the first two Parts was Dr. <HI>Geo. Bates,</HI> a learned and an eminent Physician of <HI>London</HI> in the last Age, who was afterwards Phy∣sician to <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> and so must of ne∣cessity be intimately acquainted with many things which were not known to others, and had means to look through all the disguises of that cunning Impostor, as his Station and Employ∣ment also afforded him an easie access to most of the Grandees that had then a large share in promoting the Miseries of <HI>England.</HI> The first part was published in the time of <HI>Oliver Crom∣wel,</HI> and yet is written in an Air and Stile which shews the Author durst speak truth, when if discovered, his life would have paid the price of his Veracity; and yet that time too may yield us a good assurance he did not venture his life for falshoods and slaunders; it was not
<PB REF="10"/>
then a time to bely prosperous, insolent, and in∣raged Villains.</P>
<P>He gives us this account of the Work him∣self by an Epilogue added in a latter impression, at the end of the First Part.</P>
<P><HI>Whilst the Original of this small History was in Writing, it was several times seen by the Reverend</HI> George <HI>Lord Bishop of</HI> Winchester, <HI>the Worthy</HI> Nicholas Oudart <HI>Se∣cretary and Counsellour to the</HI> Prince of O∣range; <HI>by Sir</HI> John Wederburn <HI>Knight; by Dr.</HI> Richard Owen <HI>Professor of Divinity, and Rector of St.</HI> Swithins <HI>in</HI> London; <HI>by Dr.</HI> George Ent, <HI>heretofore Physician to</HI> Charles <HI>the First, and now to the present King; and also by</HI> Fabian Philips <HI>an Attorney, who was my Assistant in searching the Rolls, Offices, and Monuments of the Law, (that I may not mention</HI> Dugard <HI>who printed it) men above all exceptions: although there is an insolent Defamer, who pretends I have fathered another mans Work, whose Ca∣lumnies I neither value nor fear.</HI></P>
<P>This Passage is inserted by him onely to prove he was the Author of it, but is at the same time a strong proof of his integrity: for it is very well known, these Persons were not all of one side in our late Distractions.</P>
<P>The first Part of this Piece was first printed about the year <HI>1651,</HI> without his name, for the information of Strangers, and therefore he pre∣miseth a short account of the Prerogatives of the
<PB REF="11"/>
Crown, and the Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subject, here; which had been so abominably misrepresented to Forreigners, that they stood generally in great doubt on which side the right lay, and considering the time when it came out first, nothing could be of greater use and benefit to the then-oppressed in∣terest of our late Soveraign.</P>
<P>Nor was it onely useful abroad, but at home also: for the People of <HI>England</HI> were then so distracted by the Contradictions betwixt the Royal and the Rebel Party, that they, at least many of them, did as little know on which side to give their Verdict, as the Neighbour Nati∣ons. Hence the Learned and Ingenuous Mr. <HI>Henry Foulis,</HI> in his Preface to his <HI>History of the wicked Plots of our pretended Saints,</HI> gives us this Account of himself: <HI>As for the Author</HI> (saith he) <HI>whilst a School-boy, he was too much sway'd to</HI> Presbytery; <HI>and delighting in the Stories of our Times, had none to peruse, but</HI> May, Vicars, Ricraft, <HI>and such-like partial Relators: by which means believing, with the ignorant, all things in print to be true, he was perswaded to en∣cline to the wrong side. But a little before his going to the</HI> Ʋniversity, <HI>lighting by chance upon Dr.</HI> Bates<HI>'s judicious Book</HI> E∣lenchus Motuum, <HI>he found the Laws and true Government to be opposite to his former Readings, and therein the Knavery and Jug∣ling of their Opposers, strange things which
<PB REF="11"/>
he had never heard of before. Which, with some other assistance, so far prevail'd with him, that in a short time he threw off Father Schism, and ever since, like little Loyal</HI> John <HI>in the Epitaph,</HI>
<Q><L>For the King, and Church, and Bloud-Royal,</L>
<L>He went as true as any Sun-Dial.</L></Q></P>
<P>There are some others who have acknowled∣ged to the World in print, the benefit they and the Government received from this first Part.</P>
<P>The Second Part was added by Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> after his late Majesties Restitution, to inform the World of the manner of his Majesties E∣scape from <HI>Worcester,</HI> and how things were carried till the deposition of <HI>Richard Crom∣wel,</HI> wherein is an excellent account of the bloudy War in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the just Judgment of God upon the <HI>Scotch</HI> Covenanters for joyning with our English Parliamentarians, upon pre∣tence of setting up <HI>Presbytery</HI> here, but indeed to inrich themselves the second time with the Spoils of <HI>England;</HI> the effect of which was, that <HI>Presbytery</HI> was ruined even in <HI>Scotland</HI> by <HI>O. C.</HI> and his victorious Independant Army, and they lost at the same time all their Civil Priviledges, and were treated, till the Kings return, as a conquered People by their fellow-Rebels.</P>
<P>The Third Part was written by one Dr. <HI>Tho. Skynner,</HI> another Learned Physician, to conti∣nue
<PB REF="12"/>
and bring down the Story, and shew the Joy of our Nation at the Restitution of his late Majesty. It is in the Original written in a florid stile, and full of curious and ingenuous Reflections.</P>
<P>The Translations of all these have been ma∣naged with great care, to make them both true to the Originals, and delightful to the Reader; onely the Translator thought fit to supply some Papers which are but hinted at, or wholly omit∣ted in the Author; as the Treaty of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> in the First Part; the Coronation-Oath, in the Third; and others. And also when there are any Papers or Expressions men∣tioned, to publish the original Papers and words, when he could find them; but when not, he hath humoured the Translation as near the Latin as the sence of the Author and <HI>idiome</HI> of the two Languages would permit.</P>
<P>There is great hope that this short account of our late horrible Confusions here in <HI>England,</HI> which is so acceptable in the Original to all For∣reigners and Learned English-men, may now translated be no less acceptable to all those who either cannot read the Latin, or care not to give themselves so much trouble; and that it may contribute something to the interest of the Government, by forewarning men how they be∣take themselves to those courses again which produced such dreadful Effects heretofore.</P>

<PB N="1" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>A short HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE Rise and Progress OF THE Late Troubles in <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ENgland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Right of Kings in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI></NOTE> as all the Records of our Anti∣quity tell us, never was governed but by the authority of a King; and though it hath been divided into se∣veral Kingdoms, or rather <HI>Camps,</HI> yet it never had rest from intestine Com∣motions, nor foreign Invasions, till it came under the Obedience and Protection to one sole Mo∣narch.</P>
<P>Since that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the person of a Monarch, for above a thou∣sand years,</NOTE> it is now above a thousand years that Kings in a continued succession have reigned with supreme Authority in <HI>England.</HI> And so great all along hath been the Love and Reverence that the People have had towards <HI>a Prince,</HI> that he was al∣ways judged the fittest and most worthy of the Go∣vernment, who was next in Bloud to the King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And he heredi∣tary,</NOTE> so that no factious Election, but lawful Birthright, could ever warrant a Title to the Crown. The Royal <HI>Heir</HI> of the last King, though an Infant, is im∣mediately carried to the <HI>Throne,</HI> even in the <HI>Cradle:</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
And in this kind of immortality in reigning, the Laws glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>And never dy∣ing.</P>
<P>To him all swear Allegi∣ance</P></NOTE> <HI>That the King of</HI> England <HI>never dies.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, and by the ancient common Law, all Sub∣jects above twelve years of age, are bound by Oath to bear a peculiar Faith (by the Laws called <HI>Alle∣giance</HI>) to the lawful Prince, to him alone, and for ever, even before he be crowned; and that their O∣bedience may be confirmed upon a double account, a religious Oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Suprema∣cy.</NOTE> that of <HI>Supremacy,</HI> is likewise to be taken to the King.</P>
<P>I must here beg the Readers pardon, if in the ve∣ry beginning I speak of the <HI>Kings Prerogative,</HI> the <HI>Priviledges of Parliament,</HI> and <HI>Liberties of the People</HI>; which to our Country-men who have studied the point, perhaps may be tedious, though to the Work we now undertake it be absolutely necessary; seeing thereby it will appear who have been the Violators, and who the Observers of the Laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Preroga∣tives of the K. or chief marks of Majesty, and the <HI>Regalia,</HI> be∣long onely to the King.</NOTE>In the first place, what great power the King has over the lives and fortunes of his Subjects, is hereby made manifest, that mediately or immediately they all hold their <HI>Estates</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>; that is to say, that whatever Lands and Possessions they enjoy in <HI>fee</HI> or <HI>feudal rights,</HI> they owe them more to the boun∣ty of <HI>the King</HI> than to <HI>Fortune.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">So that all E∣states and Pos∣sessions are de∣rived from him, and to him re∣turn at last. He hath the care of Pupils and Lunaticks.</NOTE>And therefore all Estates failing of lawful Heirs, or when the Owners forfeit them by <HI>Felony</HI> or <HI>Trea∣son,</HI> flow back to the <HI>Kings</HI> Exchequer, as to the O∣cean from whence they have been derived.</P>
<P>The <HI>King,</HI> as Father of the Country, has the care of the persons of <HI>Pupils</HI> and <HI>Lunaticks,</HI> and enjoys their Rents and Revenues. Nay, by the ancient Laws, it is not lawful for them to contract Marriage without his consent; and if they do, they are to be severely censured.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of coyning Money.</NOTE>And that what is to be given to <HI>Caesar,</HI> may be known by the publick Money, the matter, form,
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
manner, and value of <HI>Coyn,</HI> is varied according to the will and pleasure of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>All <HI>Honours, Titles,</HI> and <HI>Priviledges,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He confers all Honours and Offices;</NOTE> all publick <HI>Corporations</HI> and <HI>Societies,</HI> flow from and are consti∣tuted by the <HI>Crown</HI>; the <HI>Admiral, Chancellor, Trea∣surer, Judges, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace,</HI> are onely made by the King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which are to be administred in his name alone.</NOTE> in whose name alone their <HI>Writs, Warrants,</HI> and <HI>Sentences</HI> pass: nor does any of them enter into Office before he hath taken an Oath <HI>of Fidelity to the King, and of faithful admini∣stration.</HI></P>
<P>None but the <HI>King</HI> has power of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His power in matters of War.</NOTE> who orders <HI>Military</HI> Discipline according to his will and pleasure, and not by the forms or prescripts of Laws; and as he himself thinks fit, disposes of the <HI>Forces</HI> both by Sea and Land; it being necessary that he who watches for the safety of the Common∣wealth, should be invested with sufficient Power to repress intestine Seditions, and repel foreign Inva∣sions. Upon that account, it belongs onely to him to <HI>appoint Musters</HI> and <HI>Levies</HI> of Souldiers, secure the Castles and Garisons (with which maritim Forti∣fications <HI>England,</HI> even in the profoundest time of Peace, is no less secured than by the Seas); as of∣ten as there is need also to fit out a Fleet, and to set Governours and Commanders over both.</P>
<P>Nor is the Sword neither to be weilded by any o∣ther hand but that which sways the Scepter: so that if any one (without the Kings command) take up Arms for the defence of the <HI>Kings Person</HI> and Rights, he is by so doing guilty of <HI>High-Trea∣son,</HI> and liable to the punishment of a Traytor, with∣out a special Pardon from the King.</P>
<P>Nor is his Power more limited in Ecclesiastical than Civil affairs:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Also in Eccle∣siastical af∣fairs.</NOTE> for since the authority of the <HI>Pope</HI> being shaken off, the Church was made part of the Kingdom, and the Clergy after long reluctancy
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
began to be contented with the common priviledges of Subjects; the King became at length <HI>Custos u∣trius{que} tabulae,</HI> and (as he ever was in right be∣fore, so was he then) acknowledged and confirm∣ed by Law to be supreme <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Governour</HI> in <HI>spiritual</HI> as well as temporal affairs, and owned to be in a manner the <HI>Bishop</HI> of the Kingdom; where∣in, in the promotion of <HI>Bishops,</HI> conferring of <HI>Digni∣ties,</HI> appointing <HI>Fasts,</HI> enjoyning <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremo∣nies</HI> in the Church, he hath (with the advice of the Fathers and Rulers of the Church) always exercised a supreme and sacred Power and Autho∣rity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He moderates the rigour of Laws.</NOTE>He hath also so great power over the Laws themselves (though he obliges himself to govern according to Law) that sometimes he moderates the rigour of the Law according to Equity, pardons Malefactors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And judges in undecided ca∣ses.</NOTE> and in cases that are not decided by a∣ny Law, interposes his Imperial Sentence. Lastly, that I may assert nothing rashly, but all upon the credit of Lawyers, <HI>the life, force, and authority of every thing that is acted in</HI> England, <HI>is to be found in the King alone.</HI></P>
<P>But because the <HI>King of England</HI> has not, like <HI>Bri∣areus,</HI> an hundred hands, nor can he, like the Sun, view all things at one glance; he hath been accu∣stomed to create from amongst the <HI>Nobility, Bishops, Judges,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He chuses his own Counsel∣lors.</NOTE> and <HI>Commons</HI> of the Kingdom, without the envy and emulation of any, such and so many Counsellors as he pleases, to assist and ease him in the weighty care of the Government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He that mounts the Throne is ne∣ver to be brought to the Bar, since the Law says he cannot die.</NOTE>Having named these <HI>Prerogatives</HI> of a most Au∣gust and Imperial Crown, what shall I call that bar∣barous and inhumane Principle and Purpose of bringing the <HI>King</HI> to Judgment before the Kings Tribunal, and then to smite him with the Sword which he alone is to draw; the <HI>King,</HI> I say, whom
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
the Law it self openly declares can never die? There is no necessity of curbing arbitrary government by such inhumane Tyranny upon the sacred Person of the <HI>King,</HI> since whatever may be done in the admi∣nistration of the Government, either against the Laws of the Country, or inconsistent with the good and profit of the People, the blame and punishment of it is cast upon the publick Ministers: so that it was not flattery, but the highest Justice which gave ground to this noted maxime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor can he err, or do wrong. But as he of∣fends by his Ministers, so is he punished.</NOTE> <HI>That the King can∣not err, nor do any wrong</HI>; because the whole blame and all the punishment is wont, and ought to fall upon the publick <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Counsellors,</HI> whose duty it is to admonish the Prince, and to deny their concurrence with him in any thing that is unjust; and to resigne their place, rather than obey him when he commands any thing contrary to Law.</P>
<P>Nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heir of the Crown is by the death of his Predecessor <HI>ip∣so facto</HI> clear∣ed from all guilt.</NOTE> the Laws are so sollicitous for the safety of the Prince, as of him who is to maintain and pre∣serve the Law, that the next Heir to the <HI>Crown,</HI> whatsoever Crime he might be guilty or accused of whilst he was a private person, yet by the death of his Predecessor, as by a certain postliminious Abso∣lution, he is freed from all taint and guilt; and his stepping up into the Throne purges him from all defects. It is enough to curb him that holds the Reins of the Government, <HI>That he must expect the Judgment of God.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet it is not lawful to rule arbitrarily.</NOTE> it is not lawful for the King to rule arbitrarily in <HI>England,</HI> oppress his Subjects, or make and abrogate Laws by his sole Authority. But as the Law allows a decorous administration of abso∣lute Authority in some things to the King, so does it assigne to the Commons others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhat Rights belong to Par∣liaments.</NOTE> and those no incon∣siderable Priviledges in <HI>the Kingdom,</HI> in common with the King, that so the joynt Authority in Go∣vernment might the more easily engage the Subjects to obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">To make and repeal Laws.</NOTE>For, for the making and repealing of Laws, and the interpreting and explaining former ambiguous Statutes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impose Taxes.</NOTE> for raising of Money out of the ordinary course,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Legitimate Bastards.</NOTE> when there is occasion for it; legitimating of Bastards; naturalizing of Strangers; altering and setling the Rights of Possessions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enact the VVorship of God.</NOTE> confirming by ci∣vil Sanctions the Divine Worship, after it hath by the Convention of the Clergy been formed accor∣ding to the Word of God; setting Rates upon Weights and Measures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Set Rates on VVeights and Measures.</NOTE> and the like; that the peo∣ple may not seem to suffer any thing without their own consent and concurrence, the Votes of <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI> which is the supreme Court of <HI>England,</HI> and in conjunction with the <HI>King,</HI> under God, hath a certain Omnipotence in this little World, are necessa∣rily required.</P>

<P>The King is not obliged afterward, unless he please, to be present at their Consultations, except at the end of a Session, that he may give the strength and vigour of a Law to their Bills.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knights</HI> and <HI>Burgesses</HI> of the Lower House have severally the Oath of Allegiance administred unto them by one appointed for that effect by the <HI>King</HI>; which amongst other things, contains this clause:<NOTE PLACE="marg">All and every one of the Members of the House of Commons take the Oath of Al∣legiance to the King.</NOTE> <HI>I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and him and them will defend to the uttermost of my power, against all Conspiracies and Attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against his or their Persons, their Crown and Dignity; and make known unto his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, all Treasons and traiterous Conspiracies which I shall know and hoar of to be against him or a∣ny of them,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But lest any one being advanced to the high Ho∣nour and Dignity of consulting with the King, and sharing in some part of the Government, should for∣get that he is still a Subject; the better to keep him within the bounds of duty, he is to take another Oath of Supremacy in these words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And of Supre∣macy.</NOTE> <HI>I</HI> A.

And therefore I do utterly renounce and forsake all foreign Jurisdictions, Powers, Superio∣rities, and Authorities; and do promise from henceforth I shall hear Faith and true Allegiance to the Kings Highness, his Heirs and lawful Successors; and to my power shall assist and defend all Jurisdictions, Privi∣ledges, Pre-eminences, and Authorities granted or be∣longing to the Kings Highness, his Heirs and Succes∣sors, or united or annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</HI> So help me God, and by the contents of this Book.</P>

This being done, the Speaker in the name of himself and of all the Commons, thanks the King, and begs of his Majesty that they may enjoy their Priviledges, and have the freedom of deba∣ting; and that if any one in the heat of discourse should speak too warmly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And not to be offended with their freedom in speech.</NOTE> his Majesty would not take it ill, nor be offended; and that they may have free access to his Majesty and the Upper House so often as occasion shall require.

the Upper House; it belonging to them to judge what were fitting to be presented in Parliament, and to reject such as were trivial or seditious.</P>
<P>Each House has power to consult, debate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of de∣bating and communicating opinions be∣twixt both Houses.</NOTE> and form Bills about the matters proposed by the King, or concerning the making or abrogating of Laws; so that what is agreed upon in the one House, is by Messengers to be sent to the other: and if both con∣cur in judgment after the matter hath been debated, the Assent is marked over the head of the Bill (if it be in the <HI>Lords</HI> House) in this form of words: <HI>Les Seigneurs out assentes</HI>; The <HI>Lords</HI> have consen∣ted. And in the House of Commons, thus: <HI>Les Communes out assentes</HI>; The Commons have con∣sented.</P>
<P>But if they disagree, many times both Houses, or Committees chosen by them, meet in conference in a convenient place, which is called the <HI>Painted Chamber</HI>; where the Lords covered and sitting, in solemn manner receive the Commons standing un∣covered, and both argue the matter in debate. If in such Conferences opinions disagree (as it hap∣pens sometimes) the thing is laid aside; but if they concurr, the Bill is carried to the King: which if he approve of, it is written upon, <HI>Le Roy le veut,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">By the Kings consent the Bills are made Laws;</NOTE> <HI>The King wills it</HI>; whereby, as by a Soul infused in∣to the body, it receives life, and passes into a per∣fect Law, to be afterwards promulgated to the peo∣ple: If on the contrary the King approve not the Bills brought to him, he uses to write over head, <HI>Le Roy s'avisera, The King will consider of it:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Or otherwise rejected.</NOTE> some∣times he utterly rejects them, and then they are wholly laid aside.</P>

And so cautious have our <HI>Kings</HI> been that Laymen should not meddle in such affairs, that, as it is recorded in History, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> severely checked the Parliament for having appointed a Fast without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sking her leave; nor would she be satis∣fied, till they begg'd her Majesties pardon for it.</P>
<P>That we may return to the Authority of <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI> each House hath its several and distinct Privi∣ledges.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rights &amp; Priviledges of the Ʋpper House.</NOTE> The House of Lords not onely concurs in Council and making of Laws, but hath also power of <HI>Judicature</HI> and giving Judgment, and so of ad∣ministring an Oath, especially in weightier Causes, as in the corruption of Judges and Magistrates, and in highest Appeals: which yet, the Lawyers say, cannot lawfully be brought to a tryal, without the consent and warrant of the King; and is never done, unless the Judges of the Law do assist.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Lower.</NOTE>The House of Commons claims to it self the pri∣viledge of petitioning and proposing Laws, or of prosecuting, but never of judging, unless within its own walls, <HI>and over the Members of their own House,</HI> nor that neither beyond a Fine and Imprisonment. By ancient custom that House was so far from pro∣nouncing any Sentence (much less in cases of Life
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
and Death) in the name of the People, against the meanest Servant in <HI>England,</HI> that it never took to it self the power of administring an Oath. It is also extant in the <HI>Rolls,</HI> to this purpose: <HI>Ʋpon the hum∣ble supplication of the House of Commons, that whereas all Parliamentary Judgment belongs to the King and the Peers, and not to the Commons, unless by a Grant and Permission from the King, it would please the Kings Majesty that they be not, contrary to custom, obliged to give Judgment; whereupon the King for the future excused them from that trouble, reserving the Parlia∣mentary power of Judging for the time to come to the King and House of Lords onely, (save onely in making Laws, or imposing Taxes and Subsidies) unless when it shall otherwise seem fit to the Kings Majesty to re∣quire their particular counsel and assent for dispatching the publick Affairs of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, it was of old the custom also, that if any Controversie or Doubt arose about the validity of the Election of the Members of the <HI>House of Com∣mons,</HI> the matter was not determined by the other Members of the same House, but either by the Lords in the Upper House, or by the Judges in Chance∣ry. And if any of them also departed from the Parliament without leave from the <HI>King</HI> and both Houses, he was brought before the <HI>Kings Privy-Coun∣cil</HI> or <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> to receive sentence for his faults; but he was never punished at the will and pleasure of his own House.</P>
<P>This also is peculiar to the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> (that we may again return to their Priviledges) that it belongs to them first to debate and form the Bill for raising Money from the People.</P>
<P>Such therefore is the wonderful temper of our <HI>Monarchy,</HI> that the <HI>King, Lords,</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> have their several parts in the publick administration of Affairs; yet with that harmonious proportion, that
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
All can help, but none of them hurt the <HI>Publick.</HI> For the Prerogative of the King that gives him the supreme power of Government, and of Peace and War, tends to this, that he may have strength e∣nough to defend the Laws against the Factions of the Nobility, and the Tumults and Insurrections of the people: whilst the Nobles, by the high Autho∣rity they have in giving Judgment and making Laws, can on the one hand put a stop to tyrannical attempts, if any should be offered by the King; and on the other, curb the insolence of a tumultuous and seditious common People. Nor are the <HI>Com∣mons,</HI> through the priviledge they have of accusing any man, and giving or denying Money, unprovided of means of restraining the licentiousness of the Lords and Privy-Counsellors, and of preventing the arbitrariness of the <HI>Prince.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The providence of the Law thae the Mem∣bers might de∣bate freely and without fear.</NOTE>The Laws are very careful that the liberty of De∣bating and Voting be not obstructed through fear and the insolence of wicked men; for it is enjoyn∣ed under severe penalties, that no Member of Par∣liament come to the House with hidden or open Arms, nor that any other person armed with a Sword or any other Weapon, presume to walk in the <HI>Palace-yard</HI> or near the <HI>House,</HI> thereby to give cause of terrour and apprehension, or to lessen the reverence of the place. Yea, it hath been the cu∣stom, that the Members of <HI>Parliament</HI> and their me∣nial Servants, should during the sitting of Parlia∣ment, be protected from arrests for debt, or other slight crimes; but the Priviledge of Parliament ex∣cuses no man that is guilty of <HI>Treason, Felony,</HI> or <HI>Breach of the Peace,</HI> from the ordinary prosecution of Law. Yet if by the mistake either of the Magi∣strate or Officer, any Parliament-man or their Ser∣vants happen to be arrested, they cannot be set at liberty according to Law, but by a Writ (assigning the cause) directed out of the Chancery.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="22"/>So much heretofore did both Houses contain themselves within the bounds of modesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The modesty of the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> that if a∣ny one inconsiderately offended against the recei∣ved customs, or spake any way irreverently of the King, he was severely punished for the fault, and that at the suit and instance of the House of which he was a Member.</P>
<P>The Kings also did very seldom,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>What honour Kings were wont to shew the Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>But when occa∣sion required, reduced them into order.</P></NOTE> unless it were for weighty causes, act any thing that might give offence to so August an Assembly: Yet sometimes, upon high provocations, some of our mildest <HI>Prin∣ces</HI> have severely rebuked the whole Parliament, and caused some Members to be brought to the Bar to answer for their offences; and have punished o∣thers by Fine, Imprisonment, or Death, according to the nature of their crimes.</P>
<P>These were the old customs, and those the men that made <HI>England</HI> for many Ages past to flourish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The happiness of the King∣dom under this Government.</NOTE> being happy at home, and renowned abroad; until too much happiness (as often happens in humane affairs) with Luxury and all sorts of Vice, brought in amongst us Pride, Ambition, and the contempt of the Laws both of God and man; so that with mu∣tual emulation and envy men began to covet and invade the Rights of one another, to despise and set at nought, rather than to reverence and obey the <HI>King, Religion,</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> and to gape after No∣velties, rather than to acquiesce in what was most excellently established.</P>
<P>Of late,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhat were the beginnings of the Troubles raised by some Members of the House of Com∣mons.</NOTE> some perverse men (and they at first but a few) who had screwed themselves into the Low∣er House, being desirous of changes, and crafty Pro∣moters of publick Debates, began to clamour about the Rights and Liberties of the <HI>People,</HI> and Power of Parliaments, to arrogate to themselves unheard-of Priviledges, to be very busie where they were no ways concerned, take upon them what they were
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
not capable of effecting, and at length breaking out into insolent Expressions and Invectives against the the <HI>Kings</HI> power, calling into question the <HI>Tunnage</HI> and <HI>Poundage,</HI> which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> in all times enjoyed, and forbidding them to be payed to the King; nay, and to offer violence to their Spea∣ker within the very walls of the House; and in a word, to shake off their ancient modesty, all reve∣rence which they ought to bear to the Majesty of their <HI>King,</HI> and to trample under foot the sacred Customs of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> and Priviledges of <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Hence mutual Jealousies be∣twixt the King and Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>And then the dissolution of Parliaments.</P></NOTE>Hence arose mutual Heart-burnings and Jealou∣sies, that <HI>the King designed to invade the Liberties of the Parliament,</HI> and <HI>the Parliament to encroach upon the Prerogative of the Crown.</HI> For this reason the <HI>King</HI> put an end to several <HI>Parliaments</HI> much sooner than many desired, (but not without precedents in former times) and checked the rashness of some by imprisonment. Being some time afterward sollici∣ted, he refused to call new Parliaments, that so the Heats and Animosities might be allayed, and that they might learn for the future to bring along with them Modesty and greater Gravity to so great a Council.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This gave oc∣casion of stir∣ring the people up against the King.</NOTE>But that gave occasion to crafty and restless men of spreading their poyson all over <HI>England</HI>; so that every where they gave it out, <HI>That Religion was ru∣ined, the publick Liberty opprest, and the Laws in dan∣ger of being subverted</HI>; hoping that it would be no difficult matter to perswade credulous people of this, who were greedy of Novelties, and prone to listen to Calumnies and Slanders, especially of the great men. They reproached the King with bitter Rai∣lings, calling him uxorious, imprudent, addicted to the Popish Religion, covetous, and what else they knew to be infamous and hateful to the People. They censured the best of his actions, and strained
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
them to the worst sence. They wonderfully aggra∣vated his Misfortunes and Failings, and were more injurious than <HI>ill fortune</HI> her self in their horrid con∣structions.</P>
<P>Amongst so many Complaints and Outcries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And yet the Kingdom in a most flourishing condition.</NOTE> if you demand what real calamity happened, <HI>Britain</HI> was never in a more flourishing condition; stately Buildings both publick and private every where reared, not onely for conveniency, but even for O∣stentation and Luxury; Trade increasing dayly both in compass and profit, had already enlarged it self to both the <HI>Indies</HI>; onely unhappy in this, that with the Wealth of Strangers, foreign Vices were also imported: Arts of all sorts never look'd gayer in Colledges, Courts, and Shops; nor were the wealthy Inhabitants ever prouder; Justice was ad∣ministred according to Law; nor was any man de∣prived of Life or Goods, but by the lawful Verdict of a Jury of his Country-men, to whom these things ought to be of highest value: all the parts of Go∣vernment were so administred, that they seemed to conspire together for the publick good; save onely in this, that they could not repress the insolency and wantonness that sprung from so great prospe∣rity; and (which is not to be dissembled) being long unaccustomed to War, we had been unfortu∣nate in some foreign expeditions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Though unfor∣tunate in War abroad, and some Taxes im∣posed at home.</NOTE> and the people were incensed at some impositions at home, which though very moderate, and countenanced by publick necessity and good reason in Law, yet gave occasion to the people to pretend that the <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> of the Subject was opprest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some seditious persons are pu∣nished.</NOTE> and to outcries of In∣justice; and also the imprisonment and lopping off the ears of four or five seditious persons, sentenced by the Judges of the Star-Chamber, seemed to be punishments too severe for those halcyon days of Peace and Tranquillity. To this may be added,
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
that the Jurisdiction and Censures of <HI>Spiritual Courts</HI> wrought pity in some, and indignation in o∣thers.

<P>We may also take along with us the Zeal of the <HI>Archbishop</HI> in exempting the <HI>Clergie</HI> from the Suits and Injuries of <HI>Laicks,</HI> and preferring them to civil employments; which drew a great deal of envy and ill will not onely upon himself, but upon all the Church-men also:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Archbishop endeavouring to impose the Liturgy of <HI>England</HI> upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> of∣fends them.</NOTE> as also his endeavouring to bring into the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> the use of the Service-book of <HI>England</HI>; which, though his designe was laudable, that these three neighbouring Nations, be∣ing under the government of one and the same <HI>King,</HI> might also be joyned in an uniform manner of Worship, was yet unseasonable and ill timed, as we shall a little more fully relate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋpon which pretext, but for other causes, they grow tur∣bulent.</NOTE>Matters in <HI>Scotland</HI> were then ripe for a Rebelli∣on: for many took it ill that the King denied them the Honours and Titles to which they aspired; o∣thers were vexed that they were forced to part with some portion of the Tythes (though but moderate) which they had, upon the dissolution of the Mona∣steries, in the minority of <HI>King James,</HI> obtained from the Crown, for making a competent Stipend for Ministers, who then served the Cures at what easie rates the Patrons were pleased to allow them; but most could not digest, that the absolute Authority which they had for a long time usurped over their Vassals and Tenants, should be taken from them and annexed to the Crown.</P>
<P><HI>These</HI> chusing rather to shake the State than quit their <HI>hold; those</HI> again, rather to get Titles of Ho∣nour by the seditious Acclamations of the <HI>Mobile,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>

<P>The <HI>Irish Nobility</HI> and <HI>Priests,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who were the Authors of it,</NOTE> who were the chief Actors in this Tragedy, were encouraged to the Villany by the late successes of the <HI>Scots, who</HI> (to speak in the language of Sir <HI>John Temple,</HI> a Privy-Counsellor of that Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And what op∣portunities they made use of.</NOTE> who wrote the History of those Troubles) <HI>having happily succeeded in their attempts, obtained by their last Commotions considerable Priviledges from the King.</HI> To this adde, that our intestine Troubles seemed to offer fair opportunity of changes, it being very rational and easie to con∣jecture, that the <HI>English</HI> being ready to fall together by the ears at home, there was no fear that they would cross over to <HI>Ireland</HI> to defend and assist their <HI>Colonies</HI> in that Kingdom. Their boldness was in∣creased by the <HI>Interregnum</HI> occasioned by the mur∣der of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and the change of the <HI>Magistrates,</HI> of whom the severer and best acquainted with the State of that Kingdom, were by the interest of the

<P>Being thus in a readiness, the unseasonable dis∣banding of an Army of eight thousand <HI>Irish</HI> who had been raised for the Scottish expedition, did not a little strengthen their resolution: for though the King after the pacification of the <HI>Scots,</HI> lest they might occasion Stirs in <HI>Ireland,</HI> had permitted the <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassadour to transport four thousand of them; yet the <HI>Irish Lords</HI> put on by the Conspira∣tors, got the Parliament, under pretext that the <HI>French King</HI> might take it ill, earnestly to beseech that it might not be done. And afterwards when the King had ordered the same number to be raised for the service of the French, without any reasons alleadged, they utterly rejected it. Very few of the Captains and Officers of that Army dishonoured themselves by joyning in the Rebellion; but the private Souldiers, whose custom it is to be insolent, and at length appear valiant when they are about to be dismissed from the dangers of War, easily rushed into that Villany.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">By what arts they stir up the Colonies to joyn with them in Rebellion.</NOTE>The <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> being soothed with these so many fair opportunities of fishing in troubled waters, that they might weaken our <HI>Colonies,</HI> divide and distract their thoughts, and in the mean time incense the <HI>Natives</HI> to slaughter and rapine, they cast about all ways. To the English they brag, <HI>That the Queen is in their Army, that the King was coming with an Army to their assistance; that the</HI> Scots <HI>were agreed with him</HI>; and to make that the more credi∣ble, amongst the slaughter of the <HI>English</HI> they spare the <HI>Scots: They give out that they have the Kings Commission, and act by virtue of his authority</HI>; shewing

indeed a counterfeit Commission to which one <HI>Plunket,</HI> with the consent of many <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> at <HI>Farn</HI>-Abbey, had appended the Kings Seal taken from another old Commission, as appeared by the confessions of a great many afterwards; <HI>That they defend the King's Cause against the Puritans.</HI> A∣mongst their own men they divulge counterfeit Let∣ters, whereby they pretend to be informed from <HI>Eng∣land, That there was an Act lately past whereby all the</HI> Irish <HI>were to be forced to go to Church and assist at the Devotion of the Protestants, upon pain of forfeiture; for the first offence, of their Chattels; for the second, of their Lands and Inheritances; and for the third, of their Lives.</HI> They propose, besides, to the <HI>Natives</HI> the hopes of Liberty, and of recovering their ancient Customs: <HI>That the English Yoke is to be cast off, a King to be chosen of their own Nation, and the Goods and Estates of the English to be divided amongst the Natives.</HI></P>
<P>By this hope of booty, and of living at their own liberty for the future, the <HI>Irish</HI> are allured to the War; and being egg'd on with fury and rage, they committed such horrid and heynous Crimes, as hardly any Age can parallel.</P>
<P>The King foresaw the Storm a coming whilst he was in <HI>Scotland</HI>; and therefore that he might pre∣vent it whilst it was a gathering, he presently dis∣patched Sir <HI>James Hamilton</HI> to the <HI>Lords</HI> and others of his Majesties Privy-Council of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with in∣structions, and what money he could raise of his own and from his friends on the sudden.

<P>But the greater number, and those the wiser, thinking it enough to retrench what was superflu∣ous and superstitious, are for retaining Episcopal government and a publick reformed <HI>Liturgie: the one,</HI> because it suited well with <HI>Monarchical</HI> govern∣ment and civil interest of the State; and <HI>the other,</HI> because it seemed pious and adapted to the publick Worship of God.</P>
<P><HI>Both these,</HI> as being consonant to primitive Con∣stitutions, <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Parliaments,</HI> wisely to prevent the inconveniencies that happen from skipping from one extreme to another, thought fit to esta∣blish by Laws, and to inflict severe Penalties upon Dissenters.</P>

<P>Having by this means, at length, raised their Authority amongst the common People, so as to be chosen Members of <HI>Parliament,</HI> they set all their En∣gines at work for accomplishing their intended Pro∣ject; there is nothing in their mouths but the <HI>Rights of the People, Priviledges of Parliament,</HI> and the <HI>publick Liberty</HI>; they lay open to the quick the faults of the <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Courtiers</HI>; in scanda∣lous

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some under pretext of a Parliamentary Authority.</NOTE>But it seemed more generous and safe to the <HI>leading Rebels</HI> to protract time, and manage the matter gradually by wiles and crafty fetches, until being countenanced by a colour of <HI>Authority,</HI> they might, under a sham of <HI>satisfying publick Justice,</HI> per∣petrate the matchless Villany.

<P>For this end it is contrived and obtained, that the <HI>Parliament</HI> should again send to the <HI>King Propo∣sitions,</HI> but such as were rather imperious and hard Commands, than Conditions of Peace to be trea∣ted about, which being granted, he would pluck off his <HI>Crown</HI> with his own hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which, though the Comman∣ders of the Ar∣my had procu∣red in Parl. yet in the Camp they perswade the K. not to condescend to them.</NOTE> To which, though the Commanders of the Army and <HI>Cromwel</HI> in the first place, had given their Votes in the Par∣liament; yet in the <HI>Camp</HI> they advised the King not to condescend to them, promising that they would either obtain or command more reasonable Conditions for him; and seemed to detest those as proceeding from the hautiness and severity of the Presbyterians.</P>

dear friend to <HI>Cromwel,</HI> that there he might play his part in this business. To this mans protection the <HI>King</HI> commits himself, running of his own ac∣cord into the Snare which the <HI>Rebels</HI> had long ago laid for him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">From thence he speedily writes to the Parl. sending also Concessions;</NOTE>But that he might not be wanting to the publick whilst the <HI>Parliament</HI> were at a stand, wondering whither he might have fled, his Majesty wrote to them, sending therewith Concessions that were too easie and great to be expected, or indeed to be wish∣ed for by any; adding thereto invincible Argu∣ments, why he could not consent to the Proposals lately sent him by the Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋpon which he demands a Treaty with the Parl.</NOTE> He proposes his own <HI>Concessions</HI> and the <HI>Demands</HI> of the Army, as a fit subject for a personal Treaty: and for the sake of the People and Kingdom, earnestly desires it, <HI>be∣ing willing on his own part to condescend to any thing, that by any means he might procure Peace and Tran∣quillity to his languishing Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thus the <HI>Re∣bels</HI> oppose and take occasion of asking De∣mands preli∣minary to the Treaty.</NOTE>The <HI>Republicans</HI> of both sorts, as well they that were for a <HI>few,</HI> as for a <HI>many-headed</HI> Commonwealth, endeavouring by all means to put a stop to the Peace proposed and offered by the <HI>King,</HI> take hereby occasion to oppose to his Majesties most just desires, four unreasonable Demands, as preliminary cauti∣ons; which if his Majesty would consent to, they promise to treat about the rest.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That the Parliament should have power to raise, settle and maintain the Forces by Sea and Land, with∣in the Kingdoms of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>&amp;c. without the Kings consent; it being declared High-Treason for any others, to the number of thirty, to meet together without the authority of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That it should be lawful to the two Houses to sit and adjourn themselves when and where they plea∣sed.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That all Oaths, Declarations, Proclamations,
<PB N="91" REF="59"/>
and other proceedings against either House of Parlia∣ment during the War, should be declared void and null.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>That all Titles and Honour of Peerage conferred on any by the King since his Majesty left the Parliament, and since the great Seal was carried away, should he declared void. All these things they demand that the King would consent might be past into Law; if not, that things must remain as they were.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Scottish</HI> Commissioners who were then at <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the <HI>Scots</HI> oppose both in Parl. and before the King.</NOTE> give in their Reasons in writing against these Demands; and when, never∣theless, they saw that they were sent to the King, they protest against them in his Majesties presence, as being flatly opposite to Religion, the <HI>Crown,</HI> and the Agreements made betwixt the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>What can the <HI>King</HI> do to get out of these streights? If he grant the Demands, he voluntarily resignes up the Government; and if he refuse, he must be deposed with the ignominious brand of <HI>Obstinacy.</HI></P>
<P>The King though wanted neither greatness of Soul nor Wisdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King an∣swers.</NOTE> and therefore sends presently back an Answer: <HI>That the necessity of complying with all engaged interests in these great distempers for a perfect settlement of Peace, his Majesty finds to be none of the least difficulties he hath met with since the time of his afflictions; which is too visible, when at the same time that the two Houses of the English Parliament do pre∣sent to his Majesty several Bills and Propositions for his consent, the Commissioners for</HI> Scotland <HI>do openly protest against them: so that were nothing in the case but the consideration of that difference, his Majesty cannot ima∣gine how to give such an answer to what is now propo∣sed, as thereby to promise himself his great end,</HI> A Per∣fect Peace. <HI>And when his Majesty farther considers
<PB N="92" REF="60"/>
how impossible it is (in the condition he now stands) to fulfil the desires of his two Houses, since the onely ancient and known ways of passing Laws, are either by his Majesties personal assent in the House of Peers, or by Commission under his great Seal of</HI> England; <HI>he cannot but wonder at such failings in the manner of address which is now made unto him, unless his two Houses intend that his Majesty shall allow of a great Seal made without his authority, before there be any consideration had thereupon in a Treaty; which as it may hereafter hazard the security it self, so for the pre∣sent it seems very unreasonable to his Majesty. And though his Majesty is willing to believe that the inten∣tion of very many of both Houses, in sending those Bills before a Treaty, was onely to obtain a Trust from him, and not to take any advantage by passing them, to force other things from him, which are either against his con∣science or honour; yet his Majesty believes it's clear to all understandings, that these Bills contain (as they are now penned) not onely the divesting himself of all So∣veraignty, and that without possibility of recovering it either to him or his Successors, (except by repeal of these Bills) but also the making his Concessions guilty of the greatest pressures that can be made upon the Subject, as in other particulars, so by giving an arbitrary and un∣limited power to the two Houses for ever, to raise and levy, for Land and Sea-service, of what persons (with∣out distinction and quality) and to what numbers they please; and likewise for the payment of the Arrears, to levy what moneys, in such sort, and by such ways and means (and by consequence upon the Estates of what∣soever persons) as they shall think fit and appoint; which is utterly inconsistent with the Liberty and Pro∣perty of the Subject, and his Majesties trust in protect∣ing them: so that if the major part of both Houses shall think it necessary to put the rest of the Propositions into Bills, his Majesty leaves the world to judge how un∣safe
<PB N="93" REF="60"/>
it would be for him to consent thereunto; and if not, what a strange condition (after passing those four Bills) his Majesty and all his Subjects would be cast into. And here his Majesty thinks it not unfit to wish his two Houses to consider well of the manner of their proceeding; that when his Majesty desires a personal Treaty with them for the setling of a Peace, they in an∣swer propose the very subject matter of the most essential part thereof to be first granted; a thing which will be hardly credible to Posterity: Wherefore his Majesty de∣clares, that neither the desire of being freed from this te∣dious and irksome condition of life his Majesty hath so long suffered, nor the apprehension of what shall befal him in case his two Houses shall not afford him a per∣sonal Treaty, shall make him change his resolution of not consenting to any Act, till the whole be concluded. Yet then he intends not onely to give full and reasonable satisfaction in the particulars presented to him; but also to make good all other Concessions mentioned in his Message of the</HI> 16th <HI>of</HI> Novemb. <HI>last, which he thought would have produced better effects than what he finds in the Bills and Propositions now presented unto him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And yet his Majesty cannot give over, but now again earnestly presseth for a personal Treaty, (so passionately is he affected with the advantages which Peace will bring to his Majesty and all his Subjects) of which he will not at all despair, (there being no other visible way to obtain a well-grounded Peace). However, his Majesty is very much at ease within himself, for having fulfilled the offices both of a Christian and a King; and will patiently wait the good pleasure of Almighty God, to incline the hearts of his two Houses to consider their King, and compassionate their fellow-Subjects mi∣series.</HI></P>
<P>The King having delivered this Answer sealed up, to be carried to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> the <HI>Earl of D.</HI> who hankered too much after the <HI>Oligarchick Re∣publicans,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="61"/>
desired it to be opened again, that the <HI>Commissioners</HI> might be acquainted with what they brought back, as he said, was fitting, they being <HI>Commissioners</HI> and not <HI>Posts</HI> or <HI>Couriers</HI>; (though no such thing was contained in their publick in∣structions) he having past his promise that no pre∣judice should therefrom accrew to the King.</P>

That they might suppress this <HI>Party,</HI> of whom they had now enough, a general muster of the Forces is ap∣pointed, amongst whom one whole Regiment ha∣ving got the <HI>Democratical Proposals,</HI> which they termed the <HI>Ordinance</HI> of the People, put into wri∣ting, they carried the Paper as a signal in their hats; the <HI>Oligarchick Republicans</HI> by their sollicitations had gained one or two Regiments; and the rest of the Army consisted of both Parties promiscuously jumbled together. The <HI>chief Commanders</HI> who were of the first (as the <HI>inferiour</HI> were of the other Party) drawing together into a ring, they com∣mand
<PB N="95" REF="61"/>
the private Souldiers to throw away their Paper-signals; which when they refused to do, ac∣cording as they had laid the designe, they break in amongst them, and pulling out some of the more sawcy fellows of the Regiment, they cause them pre∣sently to be shot to death; which made the rest throw away their Badges, and submit to the plea∣sure of the Generals.</P>
<P>This danger being over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They openly rail against the King,</NOTE> they began to publish the villany they had so long concealed, to rail open∣ly against the King in the <HI>House,</HI> make Speeches, exhort the other <HI>Members,</HI> and to contrive four <HI>In∣terdicts</HI> rather than Votes: whereby,</P>

<HI>abjuring their King,</HI> was debated to and again, from ten in the morning until seven at night, and had not, after all, found the Votes rather tired out than perswaded, unless the chief of the <HI>Oligarchick</HI> Party had given them hopes that they would attempt no∣thing worse against the <HI>King.</HI> The three last Votes past in the space of half an hour with much preci∣pitation, whilst the <HI>Factious</HI> got into the places of the dissenting <HI>Members,</HI> who had withdrawn out of the House to take a little refreshment.</P>

<P>The rest he pursued into <HI>Scotland</HI>; where <HI>Argile</HI> with the Forces he had raised, being no less an Ar∣my at home than <HI>Cromwel</HI> was abroad, reduced them in a short time to such streights, that the Ar∣my which had been raised by order of <HI>Parliament,</HI> was forced to lay down Arms, and submit to the discretion of <HI>Argile</HI>'s Faction.

<P>These were the Conditions of Peace proposed by the <HI>Parliament</HI> as the subject matter of that Confe∣rence, which all passionately wished, and a great many fought for. They were the very same that had been heretofore sent to the King when he was at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and not onely rejected by <HI>his Ma∣jesty,</HI> but by the Army also, as being too unreasona∣ble:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>No notice ta∣ken of the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>To what Con∣ditions the Commissioners are tyed.</P></NOTE> they onely differed in this, that in those last there was no mention made of the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Pacificators</HI> are invested with no other authority but that of answering the <HI>Royal</HI> Arguments, and of returning Reasons to in∣duce the <HI>King</HI> to assent: they had no power of softening any Proposition, or altering the least word, nay, nor so much as of omitting the Preface. Their Instructions likewise bear, that they are to acquaint the Parliament with the <HI>Kings</HI> Concessions, and the whole progress of the Negotiation, to treat altoge∣ther in writing, nay, and to debate the Propositions as they lay in order, not descending to a new Pro∣position, until the former was adjusted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conference to be held at <HI>Newport.</HI></NOTE>Nor was it thought enough that the Conditions and <HI>Commissioners</HI> were so strictly limited; they confine the <HI>Conference</HI> also to the Town of <HI>Newport</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and the continuance of it to the space of forty days.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> also, who was to be present at the <HI>Conference,</HI> was so far well treated as to be permit∣ted to come out of his <HI>Prison</HI> and have that <HI>Island</HI> allowed him for a larger confinement; but upon promise given, that he would not depart out the
<PB N="127" REF="80"/>
<HI>Island</HI> within forty days after the conclusion of the Conference: and the sly <HI>Oligarchick</HI> and <HI>Democra∣tick Republicans,</HI> who had a hand in the <HI>Councils,</HI> were the Authors of those scruples and restrictions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. is al∣lowed his ne∣cessary servants</NOTE> With great caution the <HI>Parliament</HI> permitted some of his <HI>Majesties</HI> necessary Servants, by name, some <HI>Lawyers, Divines,</HI> and a <HI>Secretary</HI> to be present; but not to be admitted into the <HI>Conference,</HI> onely to be without behind the Curtain in the Lobby. So that the King alone was singly to sustain the person of a Politician and Divine, against the ablest <HI>Parlia∣mentarian</HI> Politicians and Divines of the whole King∣dom.</P>
<P>In managing the <HI>Conference,</HI> the King alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K.'s won∣derful prudence in the Confe∣rence.</NOTE> with such incredible Prudence and Eloquence, sifted and bafled all their strongest Arguments, with so great lenity and readiness of condescension, granted their Demands even when he had made it appear they were unreasonable (so far as with Honour and a safe Conscience he could) that he ravished them all into admiration of him; and, which was an Argu∣ment of a supernatural Wit, he brought over the <HI>Commissioners</HI> who were his most inveterate enemies, even against their will, to his Opinion, (though their Employment, and the danger of their heads, obliged them, against their Conscience, to continue in opposition to him.) Without doubt, in this, as in all things else, he gave a glorious proof of his Fatherly goodness, in that with his own loss and prejudice onely he would gladly have redeem'd his people from the havock and miseries of War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conference</HI> had for some time been taken up in composing affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the middle of the Treaty the <HI>Parliamen∣tarians</HI> require that the Mar∣quess of <HI>Or∣mond</HI>'s Com∣mission be re∣called.</NOTE> when of a sudden news is brought to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> that the <HI>Marquess of Or∣mond</HI> was arrived in <HI>Ireland</HI> to govern that King∣dom in quality of <HI>Lord Deputy,</HI> by authority from the King; and that he was to settle a Peace there,
<PB N="128" REF="81"/>
upon the best conditions he could; as also to levy an Army for delivering the King out of prison. Upon this, Letters are sent to the Commissioners in the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> with instructions to demand of the <HI>King,</HI> that he would recal <HI>Ormond</HI>'s Commis∣sion, and turn him out of that authority which was somewhat uneasie to the Pacificators.</P>
<P>In the mean while, report is made to the <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI> by piece-meals of what was transacted in the Conference; where many with a mind as averse, as the Kings was inclinable to peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K.'s An∣swers are cen∣sured in Parl.</NOTE> quible at and censure the least <HI>punctilio</HI> of every thing, unless all were condescended to in every tittle according to their own words and prescribed form: for they were afraid (which some of them openly profes∣sed) that the Propositions being fully granted, and no more place left for Animosity or Grievance, they might, if not by force from the people, yet out of shame be compelled to conclude a Peace in good earnest, which they onely desired in shew. For the the King having,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. unex∣pectedly gran∣ted many things.</NOTE> contrary to the opinion of all, condescended to many things, had not onely ad∣mitted the subject matter, but also the scrupulosi∣ties and niceties of words.</P>
<P>To the Preface, which aimed not so much at the publick Peace, as the branding of himself and his party with a note of Ignominy, he would not con∣sent, but with this clause, <HI>That nothing in that Con∣ference should be taken for granted, unless all were a∣agreed upon in general.</HI></P>
<P>He agreed to the Ist Proposition, of recalling the Declarations; to the XVIth, of the Forces; the XIXth, of the government of <HI>Ireland</HI>; the XVth, of the payment of publick Debts, <HI>Provided these Debts were stated within the space of two years</HI>; to the XVIIth, of anulling Titles of Honours; the XIXth, of the chief Magistrates of the <HI>Kingdom</HI>; the XIXth, of the
<PB N="129" REF="81"/>
Great Seal; the XIXth, of the Priviledges of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> Of the <HI>Court of Wards</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">There is no mension of the <HI>Court of Wards</HI> in these Articles, thô it is expressed both here and in <HI>Baker</HI>'s Chronicle, and perhaps was thought of af∣ter these Arti∣cles were prin∣ted.</NOTE>, provided he had an hundred thousand pound a year paid him in lieu of it.</P>
<P>In all these points he made himself an easie prey to the avarice and ambition of others; and that he might render the <HI>Kingdom</HI> more peaceable to others, he even suffered it to be snatched out of his own hands.</P>
<P>He gave his consent to all the Articles of the IIId Proposition, except one, concerning <HI>Bishops</HI> and their Revenues; yet in that he was not alto∣gether wanting to the desires of the Parliament: for whatever did not plainly appear to be of <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> he allowed might be abrogated; so that he suffered <HI>Archiepiscopacy</HI> to be abolished, <HI>Episcopal Jurisdiction</HI> also, that is, the exercise of <HI>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,</HI> and the state and priviledge of holding <HI>Ecclesiastical Courts</HI>; but he would not suffer the power of conferring Orders (<HI>and administring Church-censures</HI>) as being <HI>Apostolical,</HI> to be altered and lessened.</P>
<P>But at length the little <HI>Rabbies of the Assembly</HI> and <HI>Pacificators</HI> interweaving with the other Argu∣ments, which he could better refute, that of invin∣cible <HI>Necessity,</HI> and promising privately, that if he would consent to these at present, they would here∣after enlarge his Bonds, as also giving him hopes that the Parliament would condescend to him in other matters, provided in this he would remit somewhat of his strictness of Conscience; he con∣sents that for the space of three years, <HI>Orders</HI> shall not be conferred by the <HI>Bishops,</HI> without the consent of <HI>Presbyters</HI>; nay, that the power of <HI>Ordaining</HI> shall be suspended, until twenty Divines of his chu∣sing, and an Assembly called by the Parliament, do meet, determine, and settle the <HI>Government</HI> of the
<PB N="130" REF="82"/>
<HI>Church</HI>; to which he promised to acquiesce, if the Parliament would do the like: In the mean time he is not against it, but that <HI>Presbytery</HI> may be setled for a tryal.</P>
<P>Abhorring the thought of Sacriledge, he would not suffer <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Church</HI>-lands to be divided and alienated from the Church; but permitted them to be let out by lease for ninety nine years, paying a small yearly rent for the maintenance of the <HI>Bi∣shops,</HI> and as a token of their <HI>Tenure,</HI> provided after the expiring of the Lease, they should return to the <HI>Crown</HI> to be employed for the use of the <HI>Church:</HI> which, in the mean time, he was firmly resolved to redeem with his money, and to restore them to the <HI>Church-men</HI> to whom in right they belonged.</P>
<P>Nor would he (being mindful of his Friends a∣midst his own dangers) consent to the XVIIIth Proposition, concerning Delinquents; but he al∣lowed,</P>
<P N="1">I. That they might be moderately fined.</P>
<P N="2">II. That they may be debarred from the Kings presence and coming to Court: that some of them also may be banished, but not as Traitors, nor yet to lose their Lives and Estates, if they act to the contrary.</P>
<P N="3">III. That for three years they be excluded from sitting in Parliament.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That they might be brought to tryal, if it were thought fit, and be condignly punished, if they had acted any thing against the known Laws of <HI>England,</HI> (which certainly favoured the Kings Par∣ty): But he thought it unjust that any man should be punished for his Loyalty to him, according to the dictates of his Conscience, and the municipal Laws, by a Law made <HI>ex post facto.</HI> Yet he condescended to other Articles of the same Proposition, upon this condition, that pious and learned <HI>Church-men,</HI> free
<PB N="131" REF="82"/>
from scandal, might enjoy a third of their Livings, and not be totally deprived of the liberty of prea∣ching.</P>
<P>He could not, as he said, recal the Authorities which he had given to the <HI>Marquess of Ormond,</HI> at the very time when himself was confined to prison. The <HI>Parliament</HI> agreed with him in the rest: which succeeding, then, according to the Concessions in the XIXth Proposition, the Parliament should have the sole administration of the affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In the mean time, however, he wrote to the <HI>Marquess of Ormond,</HI> commanding him to refrain from the execution of his power, so long as the Conference and any hopes of Peace continued.</P>
<P>Whilst the Conference lasted, the <HI>King,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. makes some Proposals.</NOTE> that he might not still suffer so hard usage, and that he might try how the Members of <HI>Parliament</HI> were af∣fected towards him, gave some very just and useful Proposals to be sent to the <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>First, he desires,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To which the Parl. in a great part consent.</NOTE> <HI>That he may have leave to repair forthwith to</HI> Westminster, <HI>or any of his houses near</HI> Lon∣don, <HI>where he may treat with his Parliament at nearer distance, with honour, safety, and freedom.</HI> Which de∣sire, the <HI>Parliament</HI> having felt the pulse of the <HI>City,</HI> and being encouraged under the hands of the most part and best of the Citizens, promised, so soon as the Propositions were granted, should be allowed him.</P>
<P>Secondly, the <HI>King</HI> demands, <HI>That he may be re∣stored to the possession of the Lands and Revenues of the Crown.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>That he may have compensation for his law∣ful Rights which the Parliament have thought fit to a∣bolish.</HI> To these also the Parliament willingly con∣sent.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>That by an Act of Oblivion the memory of all things that had been done in time of the War,
<PB N="132" REF="83"/>
might be abolished.</HI> To this Proposal they did not consent, but with cautions and limitations, that gave liberty to the <HI>Parliamentarians</HI> to bring Actions against any almost of the <HI>Kings</HI> Party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The promising ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of Peace▪</NOTE>Matters being near composed beyond all mens expectation, though perhaps not so as every one desired, the <HI>Commissioners</HI> for Pacification, full of thoughts of Peace, promised the same to the <HI>King,</HI> though in that they were false Prophets: for they thought (as well they might) that the <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI> would in some measure abate in their rigid demands, when the King to mollifie them, had stript himself of the Government both of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> Nay, the glad hopes of Concord be∣gun to cherish the drooping minds of all people; which without doubt would have followed, had not factious and rebellious men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are disappoin∣ted by the Re∣bels▪</NOTE> who by clandestine arts had already driven us into a War, now openly and with force of Arms disappointed the desired fruit of the Conference, and the Peace that was ready to be concluded.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In what man∣ner.</NOTE>In the heat of the Conference, that part of the Army which had prospered in the War, and was returned home victorious, commanded by <HI>Fairfax,</HI> whom <HI>Ireton</HI> as a <HI>bad Genius</HI> haunted, was encam∣ped so near <HI>London,</HI> that in half a days time they might march thither and suppress their unprovided Adversaries, if any sudden occasion required.

length enjoy rest and peace.</HI> But privately having con∣sulted with the Members of <HI>Parliament</HI> of their own Faction, they suffer <HI>Consults</HI> to be held amongst the inferiour <HI>Officers</HI> and private <HI>Souldiers</HI> of the Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They stir up the common Soul∣diers against it; and to de∣stroy the King,</NOTE> and, at the instigation of their <HI>Emissaries,</HI> Petitions to be framed, wherein it was desired that the Treaty with the <HI>King</HI> should be broken up, and all the Ene∣mies of the <HI>Commonwealth</HI> indifferently (thereby craftily glancing at the person of the <HI>King</HI>) brought to condign punishment: These also they caused to be printed and published, that they might feel the pulse of the people. Nor was it doubted, but that the chief <HI>Commanders</HI> and <HI>Colonels</HI> were the Authors of those Petitions; and that by their Emissaries (and particularly by <HI>Hugh Peters,</HI> a Renegado from, and the reproach of the Ministery, an impudent saucy fellow) <HI>they were dispersed</HI> into all places, whereby they wheadled the Souldiers, who in their own nature were sufficiently prone to Booty and In∣novations.</P>
<P>In the mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The souldiers are drawn to∣gether near <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> the Country-people (whom we mentioned before to have made some stirs) be∣ing dispersed, and Garrisons and Governours pla∣ced in the several <HI>Counties,</HI> all the Souldiers of the Kingdom are commanded to repair to <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s Camp; who in great numbers, many following the prevailing Party, flocked together victorious and triumphant. <HI>Ireton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ireton</HI> makes a Remonstrance against the Peace;</NOTE> upon a rumour spread abroad amongst the people of a difference betwixt him and <HI>Fairfax,</HI> lurking privately in <HI>Windsor</HI>-Castle, and having called some of his Consorts of the <HI>Lower House,</HI> publishes a <HI>Remonstrance,</HI> with great ostenta∣tion of words and affected eloquence, wherein, in name of the <HI>Army, by captious quirks and subtilties,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And that in name of the Army.</NOTE> <HI>he argues against the Peace made with the King, and the Remonstrance of his Majesty, nay and desires Justice against the King himself: That those Members who the

year before had been impeached of High-Treason by the Army, might be brought to tryal; and that all who staid in Parliament heretofore, when the Speakers and rest of the Members of their Faction fled to the Army, should be excluded: That the Souldiers Arrears should be paid out of the Kings Revenue, and the Deans and Chapters Lands, to be distributed for this use especially, and also for other publick charges: That the present Parliament should be dissolved, and a better course ta∣ken for the future that the people should chuse a Repre∣sentative which should have the supreme administrati∣on of the Government.</HI> These and several other things of that nature, he very imperiously de∣mands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army be∣ing called to∣gether,</NOTE>The end of the Conference now approaching, (which the Republicans of both sorts in the Parlia∣ment, endeavoured by all Arts to stave off and pro∣tract, that the Army might more conveniently joyn) the <HI>Commanders</HI> of the Army being informed from the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> of the progress of affairs, and of the opportunities that were proper for their turn, call a <HI>Field-Council,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And a Fast appointed, ☞</NOTE> wherein all the <HI>Colonels</HI> and in∣feriour <HI>Officers</HI> meet; and there they give themselves to fasting and prayer.</P>

<PB N="135" REF="84"/>
the matter had been long before hatched in their thoughts: nor durst any man gainsay it, who had not a mind to have his name dasht out of the Roll of the <HI>Saints.</HI> And hence it was that the people dreaded their Fasts and Prayers, as ominous Prodi∣gies.</P>
<P>The Pageantry of their Devotion being over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is read and approved;</NOTE> <HI>Ireton</HI>'s <HI>Remonstrance</HI> was read, and applauded too by the Souldiers, as if it dropt from Heaven; they prefix to it the formidable title of the <HI>Army,</HI> as an Act and Deed approved by all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And presented to the Parl. in name of the Army and Peo∣ple.</NOTE> and order it to be presented to the Parliament in the name of the <HI>Ar∣my and People of England,</HI> who if they had been cal∣led to give their votes, scarcely one of a thousand would have consented to it; and all the rest could not but have cursed the perfidious Author of the villany, with all his Adherents, as the Bane and plague of mankind.</P>
<P>But the Lower House making a virtue of the ne∣cessity of the times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nevertheless, the Lower House persists in considering of the Kings Concessions; at which the Commanders of the Army are angry, and carry the K. a∣way from the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI></NOTE> take the courage to lay aside for some time that <HI>Remonstrance,</HI> and to apply them∣selves to the examining and discussing of the <HI>Royal Concessions</HI> which then lay before them. The <HI>Com∣manders</HI> of the Army taking it very ill to be thus slighted by them, who ought to have thanked them for all the honour and dignity they enjoyed, sent some Troops into the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> who having seized the <HI>King,</HI> removed him out of the Island, and clapt him up prisoner in <HI>Hurst-Castle</HI> opposite to the Island on the main-land-side, a narrow, nasty, and unwholsome place, by reason it is incompassed by the Sea.

<P>The Souldiers hoped that this beginning would
<PB N="136" REF="85"/>
put the dissenting Members into such a fear, that they would hide in holes and corners, (which had been very usual with them) and that men of their own Faction being sole Masters of the Parliament, they might do what they pleased under the cloak of the <HI>Authority of Parliament,</HI> which would justifie their Violence, and make what Laws soever might conduce to their profit and advantage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet the Mem∣bers meet,</NOTE>But the event answered not their expectations: for most part of the Members, (as if at that time they had been assisted by divine inspiration) not at all terrified by the muttering and anger of the Soul∣diers, nor the clashing of Arms, thinking themselves sufficiently secure by their character of <HI>Parliament-men,</HI> meet to consult in a greater number than ordi∣nary.</P>

Who pleased even the unwilling, and as by a kind of Charm, mitigated the hatred of many, won his e∣nemies to Friendship, and turned Railings into Praises.

<P>If any thing could be objected to him, it was so far from being a fault in so rare a Prince, that it was the height of an unseasonable Virtue, inconsi∣stent with so vitious and corrupt an Age; that is, too much <HI>Lenity</HI> to the <HI>cruel, Candour</HI> to the disin∣genuous and crafty, a <HI>strict Justice and Certitude,</HI> which is not commonly the Virtue of <HI>Kings,</HI> a <HI>Mo∣desty</HI> that distrusted his own Abilities, and a Mind so far from pride, that he was more apt to comply with the worse Counsels of others, than to stick to the best of his own; as if he had indeed believed the Calumnies of his Enemies to be true.</P>

<P>The Titular <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> (for we must know that those of the Roman Communion have their own Clergy, Priests and Bishops, se∣cretly appointed by the <HI>Pope,</HI> who live only upon Charitable Contributions) privately perform the Duties of Religious Worship, after the manner of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the same manner as if they were authorised by Law, and were not contrary to our Customs; His Ma∣jesty conniving at the Errours of an obstinate and stiff-necked Nation.

<P>The greatest part are Strangers, but <HI>Free Denizens,</HI> who, though they are sprung from <HI>English</HI> Race, yet partly by Marriage, partly being Naturalized, through long Conversation and Custom having forgot their Original Stock, are in Cloaths, Humour, and Carriage, trans∣formed into the Manners of the <HI>Natives.</HI></P>

<P>These kindled, and in all places blew the Coals of Rebellion, and, that the Breach might not be made up again, used all means by Ra∣pine, Murder, and all sorts of Villany to put things into confusion; to overthrow the Go∣vernment, renounce the <HI>King,</HI> chuse a King of the Ancient Race, or of some new Family, whether the <HI>Pope</HI> or King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or to erect a new Common-wealth of the Clergy and De∣puties of the Nobles.

This he
<PB N="18" REF="120"/>
found to be a successful resolution; for a∣bout two thousand by stealth, and as every one best could, taking occasion to get out, came over to his Camp. Nay, he was not wanting to essay <HI>Jones</HI> himself, by many fair Promises which he made him one after ano∣ther. But he, that he might oppose Art to Art, having threatned the Deserters with most se∣vere Punishments, pretended a willingness to comply with honourable Conditions, and shuffled off the Treaty with shifts and delays, though sometimes he seemed to be at a stand and uncertain what to do. However he sent private intelligence to the <HI>Rump-Parliament,</HI> and the General, in what dangerous straits he was; earnestly beseeching them to hasten the sending him Relief. In the mean time he surrounds the Walls, views the Works, repairs what is defective, casts up new Works, plants Palisadoes, drives sharp Stakes into the ground; and did what lay in his power to fortifie the place: Nay, and having sallied out upon the Enemies Camp near <HI>Finglass,</HI> he took, amongst other Prisoners, a Relation of his own, whom, for a terrour to all others, that they might not desert, he caused to be hanged.</P>

seated upon <HI>Logh Foyle,</HI> where it contracts it self into narrower compass, and is on each side beautified with goodly Meadows and Pastures, as the Water is inriched with Fishes. Hereto∣fore a Colony of <HI>English,</HI> under the Conduct of Colonel <HI>Docwray,</HI> was there established; and many <HI>Londoners</HI> flocking thither afterwards, it was called <HI>London-Derry</HI>; the delightfulness of which place, drew to it so vast a number of Inhabitants, that it became, without Contro∣versie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">London-Der∣ry <HI>straitned by</HI> Ards,</NOTE> the chief City of <HI>Ʋlster. Ards</HI> used all diligence to reduce this last place, but not by Storm, Approaches, or Mines, but by Building new Forts, or taking those that were round it, that so intercepting all Relief by Sea and Land, it might at length be forced to surrender. And, indeed, Provisions being exhausted, and all o∣ther necessaries wanting, they had been reduced to utmost straits, had not <HI>Ouen-Ro-Oneal,</HI> in the very nick of extremity, and when the Gar∣rison were at the last gasp, brought them succour.

<P>But <HI>Ouen,</HI> with the joint assistance of the Besieged, takes in all the Neighbouring Forts, and restored distressed <HI>London-Derry</HI> to full liber∣ty.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="121"/>Now the Reader is to take notice what Re∣ward he had from the <HI>Rump-Parliament,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who made an Agreement with <HI>Coot</HI> and <HI>Monck,</HI> to be Confirmed by the Rump-Par∣liament.</NOTE> for so important an Action.

<P>But without longer digression, let us return to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and <HI>Inchiqueen,</HI> who having perfor∣med Actions beyond expectation, returned tri∣umphantly to <HI>Finglass,</HI> where the <HI>Lord Lieute∣nant</HI> had settled his Camp. A Council of War being held there, it was resolved to besiege <HI>Dublin</HI>; but yet to try first if they could re∣duce it by Hunger, rather than by a Storm and Assault, lest that Royal City, and Capital of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> might be Sackt, or Burnt by the enraged Souldiers; and Friends and Foes be e∣qually destroyed.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dublin</HI> is be∣sieged.</NOTE> It was therefore thought fit to attack it on both sides; and for that end, the Lord <HI>Dillo</HI> being left with five hundred Horse, and two thousand Foot, to block up the North

and farther side of the City, the <HI>Lord Lieute∣nant</HI> himself, with the rest of the Army, crossing the River, lies down upon the other and South side of it.</P>
<P>But whilst they are passing over to go to <HI>Rathmecus,</HI> (where the River being narrower, afforded a more convenient place for building a Fort, to hinder Importations into the Town) the <HI>English</HI> Fleet comes in view, with relief to the Besieged;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reynolds</HI> and <HI>Venables</HI> bring relief from <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> wherein were embarked Colonel <HI>Reynolds,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Horse,</HI> and <HI>Vena∣bles,</HI> who had the Command, not only of his own Foot, but also of the Regiment newly raised by <HI>Monck</HI> and others.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He resolves to send thither <HI>In∣chiqueen,</HI> with the greatest part of his Forces,</NOTE>So soon as the <HI>Lord Lieutenant</HI> heard this, he forthwith designs <HI>Inchiqueen</HI> for <HI>Munster,</HI> with the choicest of his Foot, and almost the whole Horse, with orders to oppose the Enemy, in∣courage and confirm the Province, and to be∣ware of those whose Fidelity and Honesty was suspected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with the rest to block up <HI>Dublin,</HI> and intercept Provi∣sions.</NOTE> He, in the mean time, resolved to raise the Siege, and encamp his Souldiers at some distance, in two or three distinct Camps, where being strongly entrenched, they might assist one another, if occasion required, watch

<P>But at the very instant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Comman∣ders allured with the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pes of Booty, obtain first leave to straiten the Besieged, by Fortifying an old Castle near the Walls.</NOTE> the Commanders repining that they should be disappointed of the Booty, which they thought themselves sure of, whisper about, that they observed the Enemies Horse feeding without the Walls; and that if an old demolished Castle, called <HI>Baggo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s-wreath</HI> about a Musquet shot from the Walls, were new Fortified, which might be done in a Nights time, the Enemy might be hindred both from Forage and Provisions, which being wanting, <HI>Dublin</HI> must of necessity be surrendred within the space of a Week. And therefore they ear∣nestly desire, that before they drew off, they might have leave to attempt this.</P>
<P>The Counsel, upon viewing the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Counsel took;</NOTE> was thought good; and it was not long before the Army was drawn out, and a choice made of Pio∣neers for the Work: To whom Orders were given to repair the Castle, raise it higher, and cast up a Wall about it, whilst the Horse and Foot were in readiness behind to defend them. About Mid-night the <HI>Lord Lieutenant</HI> came, thinking that the work had been almost finished: but finding that it was not as yet begun, by their mistaking the way, having severely chid the Labourers, and placed another Over∣seer over them, he encourages them to the work; then returning to the Camp, he kept Watch all the rest of the Night, and by break of day gave Orders that the Army should stand to their Arms, and be in a readiness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But the work not as yet finish∣ed, <HI>Jones</HI> un∣expectedly fall in upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</NOTE> whilst he refresh'd himself a little in Bed.

<PB N="24" REF="123"/>
Alas! he found too late, that the Souldiers had been negligent in keeping Watch; and that in the mean time <HI>Jones</HI> had broken in into that half-repaired Castle, and that the Captain of the Guard being at first onset killed, all his Men were turned to a shameful flight. These things succeeding so well with the Enemy, their boldness (as it usually happens) increasing with their good Fortune, not only the whole Soul∣diers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And having de∣feated all the Forces of the besiegers, obtains a great Victory.</NOTE> to the number of twelve hundred Horse, and four thousand Foot, but a great many of the Citizens also came rushing out of the Town, and fiercely charge the Kings Forces, who were in disorder, putting all into Confusion, there being nothing but Horror, Noise, Slaughter, and flying of Men, to be heard or seen. In this deplorable state of Affairs, the <HI>Lord Lieu∣tenant</HI> having with Sword in Hand, Prayers, and Intreaties, in vain endeavoured to stop and rally the Fugitives, he breaks through the thick of the Enemy, crosses the River, and encourages <HI>Dillo</HI> with all speed to come to the assistance of the Army, and fall upon the Enemy, now wearied, and busie at Plunder. But he finds them, tho they had not as yet seen the Enemies Face, seized with a panick Fear, throwing away their Arms, and betaking themselves to flight.</P>
<P>In this fatal Engagement, the wealthy Camp is plundered, and all that during the space of a whole year, had been with much Labour, and most diligent care gathered together, is scatter∣ed in the twinkling of an Eye. Three thou∣sand Men were killed, two thousand and one hundred private Souldiers, an hundred and fifty Officers, higher and lower, taken, above eight thousand Arms, the Tents, Warlike Engines, all the Baggage and Ammunition fell all into the hands of the devouring Enemy.</P>

who passing the <HI>Shannon</HI> at <HI>Athlome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Till <HI>Axtel,</HI> who upon the first encounter had retreated, that he might procure Recruits,</NOTE> had taken some of <HI>Iretons</HI> Garrisons, and had surprised more, if he had not come in the nick of time.

<P>The Reader may be apt to wonder that the <HI>Irish</HI> shewed themselves so Cowardly and Time∣rous, during the whole Series of this War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Irish</HI> so Cowardly.</NOTE> as if from Men they had degenerated into Women, being every where defeated, though they fought for their Lives and Liberties.

in their continual good Fortune. The <HI>Irish,</HI> on the other hand, almost without Arms, for most part destitute of Weapons, and other necessa∣ries, disagreeing also amongst themselves, mi∣serably rent into Factions, raw and unskillful in War, and in a manner cowed by constant ill Fortune. Besides, they are neither compara∣ble to the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Foot</HI> nor <HI>Horse,</HI> how brave soever they be in Foreign Countries.

He is answered, <HI>That if Conditions were offered for the whole Kingdom of</HI> Ireland, <HI>they would willingly listen unto them.</HI> But seeing he would grant none but private and particular Articles, both Parties prepare for a Siege.</P>

In Trinity Colledge of <HI>Oxford</HI> he was initiated in the liberal Arts, and made therein no contemptible Progress, af∣terward he applied himself to the Study of the <HI>Common Law</HI> in the <HI>Temple</HI>; in which having got a little smattering, from his very Youth he drank in the Errours of the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> and assisted the <HI>Fanaticks</HI> in drawing up a Petition against the holy order of Episcopacy; which was afterwards by <HI>Pennington</HI> and a numerous rabble of <HI>Londoners,</HI> ready at that time for such attempts, presented to the Parliament. Not long after, the Troubles daily encreasing, he struck in with <HI>Cromwel</HI> when he was in the Isle of <HI>Ely</HI> being first admitted into his Quarters, then by <HI>Cromwel</HI> being made Governour of the whole Island, he was presently after advanced to be his Son in law. Having there served an Ap∣prentiship, he enured his body to the War, by a voluntary lying upon the ground, fasting, watching and exercises, before he came to the Tryal of it, until by degrees he at length, ad∣vanced almost to the Chief command in the Ar∣my. Hence forward he became his inseperable Companion; especially in assisting him in all <HI>Declarations, Articles, Letters</HI> and <HI>Treaties</HI> that were to be made. He grew indefatigable in la∣bour and pains, being accustomed to spend night and day in his head-piece and boots; and
<PB N="53" REF="137"/>
in ordering of Civil Affairs also to watch till midnight at length, as the Devil would have it, he was one of the chief in shedding of the Roy∣al Blood, his Memory, for that unparalelled Villany, being execrable to all Posterity. In <HI>Ire∣land</HI> he always stood by the <HI>Anabaptistical Fana∣ticks,</HI> relying upon their counsels for these he gave his Vote both in Civil and Military Affaires; and with them filled the Towns, Councils and Camp.

They are a kind of land Pirats; who wandring amongst Lakes and Bogs, according to the light-footedness of the Na∣tion, they safely skip over the Quagmires and loose ground, wherein strangers unacquainted with the places that follow them commonly stick. They therefore give orders to the Soldiers, who had now nothing else to do, to divide them∣selves into small parties, and so to environ, hunt, and kill them like wild Beasts, which be∣ing done, they either mutually betrayed one another, or found their holds and lurking pla∣ces to be so unsafe for them, that in two years time there was none of those Enemies of man∣kind any where to be seen.</P>

As he was no cunning man himself, so neither was he reckoned a a great prier into the Counsils of other men: And being so qualified, he became dear to the common Soldiers, and for that no ways suspected by the more Powerful. In a word, he was no ill man, but that by taking up Arms against his own King; he had for ever stained his Reputation by the horrid Crime of Treason and Rebellion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And a grievous Famine also.</NOTE>Not long before, if not about the same time, so great a scarcity and Famine was sent upon them from above, that, with horrour, I mention it, the starved Mothers Sacrificed to their Bellies the dear Fruit of their Wombs; nor (as it is written of <HI>Saguntum</HI>) could inexorable hunger be satisfied with less than humane Flesh.</P>
<P>Now though these Evils fell heaviest upon the <HI>Irish,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> are burdened with Taxes.</NOTE> yet it is not to be omitted, that a most heavy Tax, of six and thirty thousand pounds <HI>per Month,</HI> was imposed equally upon the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI>; and that upon the <HI>Irish</HI> too, when so many Lands and Estates lay desolate without Possessours, and when there were neither Men nor Cattle to labour the Land; especially by reason of the multitude of <HI>Tories,</HI> who every where carried away the Fruits and Corn, so that some Landlords being disappointed of the hopes of their Crops, betook themselves to flight; others complained that their Crops were not sufficient to furnish them with Bread, and other

necessaries for their Families; and not a few sold their Inheritances for two or three years pur∣chase.

<P>All Law being administred at the pleasure of four or five Judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Law in a manner Arbi∣trary.</NOTE> was in a manner Arbitra∣ry; and depended upon the Wills of the <HI>Com∣missioners,</HI> and <HI>chief Commanders</HI> of the Army; nay, and sometimes of the Souldiers, especially the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> against whose Judgment, if the Court at any time pronounced, they cry out of the breach of Faith, and the violation of the Laws of God and Man.</P>
<P>About that time the <HI>Rebels</HI> surprised two or three very strong Forts, near <HI>Galloway,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Forts sur∣prised by the Re∣bells, are reco∣vered by <HI>Rey∣nolds.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ems∣buffen, Ernescrought,</HI> and <HI>Arran,</HI> which were scituate in some of the numerous Islands on that Coast.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strife betwixt the new and old Souldiers about dividing the Spoil,</NOTE>But for easing of the Publick Charges, there was a heavy dispute betwixt the new Souldiers, that came lately over into <HI>Ireland,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the <HI>Veterans,</HI> who had served the <HI>Parliament,</HI> in suppressing the Rebellion in its first rise.

enjoy their due proportion of the same.</HI> With this they were pleased, and had it in a great part performed.</P>
<P>They had often laboured hard about the di∣viding and appropriating of the <HI>Irish</HI> Lands: Mathematicians met, and laying their Heads to∣gether made Divisions; but in a rude manner only, by a general Estimate, some by the view, others by measuring.

He undertook, in the space of thirteen Months, to measure all <HI>Ireland,</HI> (in respect of forfeited Lands) Geometrically, and to allow every one their several Portions: and, indeed, perfor∣med it.

By this means he measured five millions, or more, of <HI>English</HI> Acres; and by the help of a Chain, and other Instruments, he ran over an hundred thousand Miles, five times the circumference of the World.

that hardly in any Age a more remarkable ad∣venture hath happened, I shall, according, as I have heard it from the <HI>King's</HI> own Mouth, relate with some exactness and curiosity.</P>
<P>The King went into the Wood in the very nick of time, as will appear. For within less than half an Hour, the Souldiers of Colonel <HI>Ashenhurst</HI> come in quest of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ashenhurst's</HI> Souldiers search the Monastery.</NOTE> hunt all over the Monastery, and running from Chamber to Chamber, search into all secret places, reces∣ses, and hidden corners. Yet, as Fate would have it, they made no enquiry abroad out of the House, for it rained all Day, and the drop∣pings from the Trees made the Grass very wet; so that what did hurt to others, saved the <HI>King.</HI> For whilst he lurked amongst the thick shrubs of the Woods, <HI>Richard Pendrell</HI> borrowed a Blanket for him to cover him in the Rain, and furnished him with a Bill, that he might seem busie in mending Hedges, entreating the Wife of a Countrey-man, one <HI>Francis Yates</HI> that was related to him, that if she had any Victuals ready she would bring it into the Wood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Countrey-man's Wife brings Victuals into the Wood for the King to feed upon.</NOTE> She without delay brings forth some Milk and Su∣gar, with a few Eggs and Butter.

But they were hardly gone the first mile, when they had a Water-mill to pass by, where they must cross the River on a Wooden Bridge: The Gate which they opened making a noise, the Miller comes out, and in a threatning tone asks them whither they were going so late at Night; and bids them stand. <HI>Pendrell</HI> terrified by that un∣expected thunderclap, leaving the Bridge, ha∣stily wades through the Water, and is follow∣ed by his August Companion, who in the thick darkness, was not so much guided by his sight, as by the ratling of his Leathern Breeches. The Pursive Fat Miller soon gave over the pursuit; and the rest of the way was free from dan∣ger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Madely</HI> he is lodged in a Barn,</NOTE>At length they come to <HI>Madely,</HI> where <HI>Pen∣drell</HI> knocking at the Door, is presently let in.

They send to be enformed of an opportunity of passing the River, and have news brought back, that not only the Bridges are guarded by Souldiers, but also the Ferry-Boats most strictly observed, and

therefore it would be very difficult and unsafe to pass the River.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River being strictly guard∣ed, he returns into the Wood from whence he came.</NOTE> When it was night he was received into the House, where the good Wo∣man stained his Hands and Face somewhat more with a Decoction of Galls, and having taken his leave, he returns back the same way on Foot to <HI>Boscobel,</HI> there to stay for a more com∣modious opportunity of travelling.</P>
<P>Being come back before Day, he tarried in the Wood, till <HI>Richard</HI> went to see if any Soul∣diers were in <HI>Boscobel</HI> House; but he finds none there save Colonel <HI>Carlos,</HI> whom we mentioned before to have, with others, kept the <HI>Cromwel∣lians</HI> in Play at <HI>Sudbury</HI>-gate, who being born thereabouts, was just come to a Friends House, to beg a little Bread.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Early in the Morning he is by <HI>Carlos</HI> brought into <HI>Boscobel</HI>-house▪</NOTE> <HI>Carlos</HI> being informed who lay hid in the Wood, with the two <HI>Pen∣drells</HI> went streight out to him, and after joyful Congratulations on all hands, they conduct him into the House; but the Sand that was got in∣to his Shoes, whilst he ran through the River, had rub'd the Skin off, and fetch'd Blood from his Feet, which a poor Woman cured by washing them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Having taken refreshment, he climbs up upon an Oak.</NOTE> Then both being refreshed with Coun∣trey-fare, they forthwith return back into the Wood; where climbing up to the top of a thick and leafy Oak, they spend the Day there: The <HI>King</HI> after long watching falling fast asleep up∣on the Arms and in the Bosom of <HI>Carlos.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In the Night time he is hid in a <HI>Priests-hole.</HI></NOTE> At Night they come down, and, being very hungry, return to the House, where they were shew'd a Place called a <HI>Priests-hole,</HI> almost unscrutable, which pleased the King so well, that whilst he stay'd there he would trust himself no more a∣broad.</P>
<P><HI>Humphrey,</HI> another of the five Brothers of the <HI>Pendrells,</HI> who kept a Mill hard by, had gone

to <HI>Sheffual</HI> to pay his Assessment; where, in the House of Captain <HI>Broadway</HI> Collector of the Money, he accidentally met with an <HI>Oliverian</HI> Colonel, who very earnestly sought after the King; and hearing that this Countrey-man li∣ved near the Abbey of <HI>Whitladies,</HI> he asked him if he knew any thing of the King, or of the Abbey:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pendrell</HI> the Miller being asked concern∣ing the King,</NOTE> adding, <HI>That if any would discover him, he might gain a thousand pounds Sterling; but that if he were found to have concealed, or hid him, he would undoubtedly suffer death for it.</HI> Yet honest <HI>Humphrey,</HI> preferring the safety of the King, and his own honesty before any hopes of gain, faithfully kept Counsel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preserved his Loyalty unvio∣lated.</NOTE> and made answer, that he knew nothing.

<P>In the mean time <HI>John Pendrell,</HI> when he was shewing the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> his way to <HI>London,</HI> found it every where so pestered with Souldiers, that he thought it safest to hide him and his Horse in a Marle-pit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wilmot</HI> coming out of a Marle-pit, is commit∣ted to the care of <HI>Whitgrave.</HI></NOTE> until he could find out a more commodious lurking place; and at length he happily committed him to the trust of <HI>Whit∣grave</HI> and <HI>Hudlestone,</HI> (though both Roman Ca∣tholicks) <HI>Hudlestone</HI> being Tutor in the House to Mr. <HI>Whitgrave</HI>'s three Sons.

found there at length, and acquainted with the Kings mind, he promises next night to re∣turn and meet the King at <HI>Mosely,</HI> five miles distant from <HI>Boscobel.

Whither so soon as he was come, he dismissed the countrey-men with many promises, which have been since largely per∣formed.</P>
<P>Then did <HI>Whitgrave</HI> and <HI>Hudlestone</HI> conduct him to <HI>Wilmot,</HI> with whom having had a long conference about his Affairs, and taken some re∣freshment of food, he was led into a private Chamber to repose himself and sleep.

And so, indeed, they came, yet he being innocent would not avoid them; but the King slipping into a private place, and the doors being all instantly opened, he confidently speaks to them; and by the testimony of Neighbours, and other Ar∣guments, so clearly convinced them of the con∣trary of what they suspected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And depart.</NOTE> that without so much as coming up the stairs, of their own ac∣cord they left him, without any further distur∣bance.</P>
<P>The same day Soldiers make a new search in the <HI>Abbey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King is a∣gain searched after in the Ab∣bey.</NOTE> having been informed by an <HI>Ensign</HI> who was made Prisoner, that the King certainly absconded there; <HI>for that he had seen him with

some other Company arrive there, and that he had observed no such person depart from thence.</HI> They therefore break into all the Rooms, search eve∣ry Chamber, Closet, and Corner; break down the Wanescot and partition walls, and seek in every little hole, but in vain. Then they exa∣mine the Master of the House, with a charged Musket cockt at his Breast; threatning him, that if he did not forthwith bring forth the King, he should die upon the spot. But he abso∣lutely denies that he knew the King; yet confessed that many came to his house that night, who having eat up all his Victuals went off again. The Soldiers there upon turning to the <HI>Ensign,</HI> soundly banged him for telling a lye.</P>

Perhaps,</HI> replied the King, <HI>he has got by by-ways back into</HI> Scotland. <HI>No,</HI> said the Smith, <HI>that is not very likely; he rather lurks secretly somewhere in</HI> England, <HI>and I wish I knew where he were, for I might get a thousand Pounds by taking him.</HI> After the Horse was shod, the King departed, and upon the Rode, told his Mistress what discourse he had had with the Smith. When they were come near to <HI>Strat∣ford,</HI> they had a mind to foard over the River of <HI>Avon,</HI> about a mile below the Town: But drawing nearer, they perceived Soldiers Hor∣ses feeding in the Meadows, and the Troopers lying upon the ground, on the other side. There they consult what was best to be done. The King was for going confidently on; but <HI>Lassels,</HI> thinking still on the Injury which he had lately received from the Soldiers, thought it safer to

<P>As he came out of his Chamber in the morn∣ing, <HI>Gorge</HI> asked him, <HI>what he heard of the</HI> King <HI>and of the Battel?</HI> But seeing he faultered in his Answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And is visited by Doctor <HI>Gorge</HI></NOTE> <HI>I am afraid,</HI> says he, <HI>you are a Round∣head; but I will try what Metal you are made of</HI>; and taking him presently into the Buttery, he drinks to him the <HI>King's Health</HI> in a Glass of Wine, which the King pledging, assured him that he never was a man of that Stamp.

consented, and assuring him that the <HI>King</HI> would be there three days after, he returned.</P>
<P>But the night before, <HI>Norton</HI>'s Wife was brought to Bed, after a hard and dangerous La∣bour, and was not to be left by her Sister, (for so she called <HI>Jane</HI>) in that Condition. That she might therefore have a civil pretext of de∣parting, a Letter is pretended to have been just then brought from her Aged and Decrepit Father;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jane</HI> counterfeits Letters as from her dying Fa∣ther.</NOTE> wherein he acquaints her, that <HI>since her departure he had been grievously ill, and that he stood in need of her present assistance</HI>; he there∣fore bids her, <HI>if she tendered her Father</HI>'s <HI>Life, to hasten home.</HI> The Letters being produced, and the Rumour spread over the Family, <HI>Jane</HI> and <HI>Lassels</HI> take their farewel, leaving his Wife with the Lady in the straw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For a pretext of departing late at Night.</NOTE> and with their Ser∣vant, whom the <HI>Kings Majesty</HI> personated, they depart. <HI>Rogers,</HI> who by by-ways had conducted <HI>VVilmot</HI> from <HI>VVinter</HI>'s house to <HI>Nortons,</HI> was their Guide; and they lodged the first night at <HI>Carew-Castle</HI> seven miles on this side <HI>Trent.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They go to <HI>Ca∣rew-Castle,</HI></NOTE> The appointed hour of their coming drawing nigh, <HI>VVindham</HI> and his Wife, as if to take a walk, went out to meet them; and send the King privately into the house, by one whom they had chosen for that purpose:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And next day to Trent, where <HI>VVindam</HI> li∣ved.</NOTE> <HI>Jane</HI> and <HI>Lassels</HI> in the mean time are publickly received as Relations, who coming from a place far distant, were to be gone next day. In this place the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Majesty</HI> stayed secure∣ly nineteen days, expecting a Vessel at leisure, and having been several times disappointed. But one day it happened that the Countrey People fell to ringing of Bells, with more than usual Solemnity; and the King, enquiring into the cause of this extraordinary rejoycing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A report of the <HI>King's</HI> Death.</NOTE> was told, that it was for the joyful News of the King's
<PB N="141" REF="181"/>
Death, which was confidently reported. But whilst they consulted, and cast about a long time concerning a passage, <HI>VVindham</HI> bethought him∣self of one <HI>Elden</HI> a Merchant, formerly a Cap∣tain under <HI>CHARLES the First,</HI> who since that, drove a considerable trade at <HI>Lime,</HI> that he possibly might procure a Vessel, since he had assisted the <HI>Lord Berkley</HI> in distress with a safe passage. Therefore <HI>VVindham</HI> is dispatched to him to learn, whether or not he could procure a safe passage for <HI>VVilmot,</HI> and another Noble∣man, who had made their escape from <HI>VVorcester</HI> fight. He readily listened to it, and presently went to <HI>Chayermouth,</HI> near to <HI>Lime</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Elden</HI> freights a Ship at <HI>Chay∣ermouth.</HI></NOTE> where ha∣ving sent for the Master of a Ship, he asked him, under promise of secresie, if he durst ven∣ture to carry <HI>VVilmot</HI> and his servant safely over to <HI>France.</HI> He undertook it, and bargains with a Captain for threescore Pound, which he obli∣ged himself under Hand and Seal to pay him, after he had carried a Nobleman over to <HI>France.</HI> The hour and day, when he was to put them on Board in a Boat, are prefixed.</P>
<P>Hitherto all things succeeding according to their expectation; there only wanted a pretext of staying in Lodgings, till all things might be made ready for their passage. For that end <HI>Henry Peters, VVindham</HI>'s Servant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peters</HI>'s device whereby he pro∣vides lodgings in that place.</NOTE> who was privy to the design, applies himself to an Hostess at <HI>Chayermouth,</HI> and, amongst other discourses, told her that he was servant to a worthy Noble∣man, who was deeply in Love with a Maid that had neither Father nor Mother, who lived not far off, and was as much in Love with him: But that her Guardian opposing the Marriage, he resolved to steal her away by Night.

them in her house; and at the same time gives her a small Gift as a pledge of a greater re∣ward, and drinks a Glass of Wine with her. The woman softned by the present, and touch∣ed with Compassion for the young Lady, pro∣mises to serve them. Leaving therefore <HI>Trent,</HI> the King sets out towards <HI>Chayermouth,</HI> with <HI>Juliana Conisbey</HI> his pretended Bride, who was privy to the matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>King</HI> goes thither, carry∣ing <HI>Juliana Conisbey</HI> with him as his Bride.</NOTE> riding behind him upon the same Horse. The <HI>Lord Wilmot,</HI> Colonel <HI>VVindham,</HI> and <HI>Henry Peters</HI> accompany them; and were met by <HI>Elden,</HI> who carried them into a private house, whither he went under pretext of view∣ing a little Farm: Here the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Majesty</HI> dis∣covered himself unto him, giving him a small present as an earnest of future Gratitude. From thence the Merchant goes to <HI>Lime,</HI> that he might give notice to the Master of the Ship, to be in readiness to put to Sea at the appointed time; The King with the rest went to their Lodg∣ings at <HI>Chayermouth</HI>; and <HI>Peters</HI> to stay for the Boat. But having waited till it was almost day, he returned without any News of the arrival of the Boat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But losing hopes of a Ship, he presently departs</NOTE> This put them all into disorder; and made them think of taking other measures, there was no safe place here to stay in; and the King was resolved not to loyter a mo∣ment.</P>
<P>After a short consultation, the King with <HI>Juliana,</HI> and the Colonel accompanying them, advance towards <HI>Bridport,</HI> there to expect the coming of the Lord <HI>VVilmot</HI> and <HI>Peters</HI> in an appointed Inn. <HI>Peters</HI> being to go to <HI>Lime</HI> to learn from the Merchant the reason of the disappointment: And <HI>VVilmot</HI> staying behind in the Inn, upon pretext of new shooing his Horse. But <HI>Elden</HI> the Merchant, who thought
<PB N="143" REF="182"/>
that by this time they had made half their Voy∣age, could not imagine the reason of the breach of promise, nor could he attribute it to any thing else, save that the man taking his leave of his Friends, it being then the Market-day at <HI>Lime,</HI> had drank so much as to make him forget the prefixed time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Ma∣ster of the Vessel failed so foully.</NOTE> But it was known after∣ward, that the Master of the Vessel being come home, to take clean Cloaths and other necessa∣ries for his Voyage with him, was locked up in his Chamber, and bolted in by his Wife: For that very day a Proclamation had been made in the Town, whereby <HI>it was declared Death for any Person to aid or conceal the</HI> King; <HI>and a thou∣sand Pounds promised to any that could apprehend him.</HI> This put the woman into so great fear, lest her Husband in doing that Office, which he had confessed to his Wife to have taken upon him, might suffer Shipwrack on Shore: She therefore used Entreaties, Tears, and almost Violence, to hinder him from it; and at length screamed out, thereby to allarm the Neigh∣bourhood. Being therefore overcome by so much importunity, he kept at home, and com∣mitted himself to the direction of his Wife.</P>
<P>Upon the way to <HI>Bridport VVindham</HI> went a little before the King, to view the Rode;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They came to <HI>Bridport</HI> full of Soldiers.</NOTE> and coming near the Town, he found it to be full of Soldiers. For there was a Muster that day, and a taking on of Soldiers, for an Expedition a∣gainst the Isle of <HI>Jersey,</HI> under <HI>Haines. VVind∣ham</HI> was therefore for the Kings going to ano∣ther place, but he laying aside all fear would needs enter the Town, lest he might seem to have deceived <HI>VVilmot,</HI> and partly also that he might refresh himself, tir'd out with night-watch∣ing and travelling, and wait for the coming of
<PB N="144" REF="183"/>
<HI>VVilmot.</HI> The <HI>Colonel</HI> took care to provide a Chamber and Victuals; which was no easie mat∣ter to be done amongst so many Guests. The King, in the mean time was employed in carry∣ing the Horses into the Stable, and looking af∣ter them; nor could he avoid talking with the Soldiers in the yard about his Journey.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where the <HI>King</HI> was very near discovered by an Hostler.</NOTE> But the Hostler looking him in the face as he deli∣ver'd him the Horses, told him, <HI>You are welcome, I know you very well. Where did you know me?</HI> an∣swered the King. <HI>At Exeter,</HI> said he; (for the King had continued long there during the heat of the War,) <HI>I lived two years in an Inn there. And so did I,</HI> replied the King, <HI>in the Service of Ma∣ster</HI> Porter. <HI>I am glad I have met with a Coun∣try-man; but I perceive you are so busie that you have no time to drink with me, when I come back from</HI> London, <HI>we'll talk of old Stories.</HI> Being pleased with these promises, and full of Busi∣ness, or God Almighty casting a Mist before his Eyes, he forbore all farther discourse.</P>
<P>Shortly after, <HI>VVilmot</HI> passing through the Town, they take Horse, and following the streight Rode to <HI>London,</HI> they met with several Travellers in the way; and amongst those one who had formerly been a Servant to <HI>CHARLES the First</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">From thence, as good luck would have it, to <HI>Broad-VVind∣sor.</HI></NOTE> Therefore thinking it most conveni∣ent to turn out of the Rode, they followed the next way upon the left hand; and having rid a long time, towards night they came to a Village called <HI>Broad-windsor. Windham</HI> goes be∣fore to enquire where they were; what the name of the Village was, and whither the way led: And by good luck he stumbled upon an Inn-keeper an old Servant of his own, who had been also a Soldier in the Kings Army, pleased with this good Fortune, he speaks him kindly,
<PB N="145" REF="183"/>
and because it grew dark he easily obtained Lodging that night for his Company. Howe∣ver it was not long before the Constable came with forty Soldiers at his back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where he is dis∣quieted by Sol∣diers quartering there,</NOTE> who marching to the Sea Coast to be transported over to <HI>Jer∣sey,</HI> must be quartered there. The House being pestered with them, the <HI>Kings Majesty</HI> had but a very narrow Lodging, yet that was not all the inconvenience. For about midnight a Wo∣man that followed the Soldiers fell into Labour: Which being noised about, the People of the Village flock'd together, and kept a bawling and heavy rout about the keeping of the Child and Mother, which continued till break of day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the Country People.</NOTE> when the Soldiers, weary of the jangle, haste∣ned to their Ships.</P>
<P>During the hubbub, let us look back a little to <HI>Chayremouth,</HI> where the Shoeing of a Horse went near to have cost the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> dear,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wilmot</HI> is in danger at <HI>Chayremouth,</HI></NOTE> by a discourse started betwixt the Smith and the Hostler. The Smith asking, <HI>From whence came these Gentlemen?

So that the Host∣ler, hoping to make his Fortune, went to con∣sult the Minister of the place, one <HI>Westley</HI> a great stickler for the <HI>Regicides,</HI> what he had best to do on this occasion. But neither was it fit to

disturb him at his Morning Prayers; nor durst the Hostler stay till they were winded out, for fear of losing the Vails he expected from the Gentleman that was upon parting, and there∣fore returning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who having se∣riously weighed the matter,</NOTE> without any thing done, he lets him go. The Smith having blazed about the story, presently came the Minister, so∣licitously enquiring of the Inn-keeper, what the Travellers were that he had lodged that night; from whence they came, whither they were go∣ing, and what was their Business there? His suspicion being encreased by the Inn-keeper's an∣swers, he runs to <HI>Butler,</HI> the next Colonel, for obtaining a Warrant to raise the Countrey and Soldiers for apprehending the King.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He hunts after the <HI>King,</HI> tho too late,</NOTE> The Co∣lonel refusing, Captain <HI>Massey,</HI> quartered hard by, having gathered together as many Horse as he could in the hurry, follows after on the <HI>London</HI> Rode as far as <HI>Dorchester</HI>; but the King, dy divine Providence, having quitted the Rode, he returned disappointed of his fair hopes.</P>

<P>The King's steps, however, are to be traced by a surer Guide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>King</HI> re∣turns to <HI>Trent</HI> having sent <HI>VVilmot</HI> to <HI>Coventry.</HI></NOTE> For after mature deliberation, it was resolved upon, that he should return to his known recess at <HI>Trent</HI>; and that the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> with <HI>Peters</HI> should hasten to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> that there he might advise with <HI>John Coventry,</HI> the eldest Son of

the <HI>Lord Keeper Coventry</HI> by a second Marriage, by what means the <HI>King</HI> might either securely pass the Seas, or at least find a new retirement; for it was to be feared lest staying too long in one place, he might be discovered. After a consul∣tation with <HI>Coventry,</HI> application is made to one <HI>Mrs. Hide,</HI> a Widow, who lived at a Village called <HI>Heal,</HI> within a mile of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> that she would look out for a lurking place; and <HI>Robert Philips,</HI> who had been a Colonel in the Army of <HI>CHARLES the First,</HI> is sent to <HI>Southampton</HI> to freight a Vessel.

But it fell out unluckily, that the same Ship, whilst the <HI>King</HI> was going to the Widows House, was taken up, and engaged to carry o∣ver Soldiers and Ammunition to the Isle of <HI>Jer∣sey. Philips</HI> being therefore disappointed of his hopes, begs assistance of <HI>Colonel Gunter,</HI> whom he met with by chance, in that affair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>King</HI> g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es to <HI>Heal.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>King</HI> in the mean time came to the Widows House in the night time, and goes to Supper, Doctor <HI>Henchman,</HI> afterward Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> with other Guests, sitting with him at Table. After Supper, he privately disclosed himself to the Widow, and entreated shelter from her; and though she had never seen him before but once, and that seven years before in passing, yet at first sight she knew him. She therefore advises him early in the morning to depart to∣wards <HI>London,</HI> but having turned out of the way, to come back about one of the Clock in the afternoon, at what time he should by a back door be let into the House; for that being a Market day at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and all her Servants and other Witnesses being gone thither by

<P>In the mean time, by means of Colonel <HI>Gun∣ter,</HI> a Vessel was hired at <HI>Bright-helmstead</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI>; which so soon as the King knew, all things being in a readiness for a departure, his <HI>Majesty</HI> in good earnest takes leave of the Lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From thence he hastens to <HI>Bright-Helm∣stead, Gunter</HI> having hired a Vessel;</NOTE> and in the night time, accompanied by Colonel <HI>Philips,</HI> he removed to the house of one <HI>Simmons,</HI> near <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and came next day in the Eve∣ning to an Inn at <HI>Bright-helmstead</HI>; where all sit down at Table together, the King, <HI>Gunter, Wilmot, Mansel</HI> a Merchant, and <HI>Tetershal</HI> Master of the Vessel, opposite to the King.

hoping that by branding them with these re∣proachful Characters, they would at length be fain to put the Power into their hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Objections are boldly e∣nough answered.</NOTE>On the other hand the <HI>Rump-Members,</HI> Ma∣gisterially grave, by a long possession of Au∣thority, <HI>bid the Soldiers mind their own Affairs, look to their Arms, and obey Orders, that they, to whom the care of the Common-wealth was committed, and the business of settling a new Government, ha∣ving long laboured in the Affair, with no small Pro∣gress, would at length by the help of God bring it to perfection.</HI> They bid them have a care, <HI>in the mean time, that they make no Tumults, seeing they who had pulled a King from his Throne, wanted neither Resolution nor Force to reduce into order li∣centious Souldiers, though milder courses were more pleasant to them.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soldiers re∣ply.</NOTE>But the Soldiers disdaining that they should be thought pragmatical, and medlers in Affairs that did not belong unto them, answer those State-Advisers, <HI>That they were not Mercenary Soldiers, nor had not taken up Arms only in Pro∣spect of pay, but for maintenance of the Publick Li∣berty, neither would they lay them down till they found the common Fruit of their endeavours.

But seeing the <HI>Dutch</HI> could obtain no Victory in that unexpected Aggression,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> ex¦cuse the matter,</NOTE> their <HI>Embassadors</HI> excuse the Matter, as having been a fortuitous Engagement, when they themselves thought of nothing less.

<P>Few <HI>Nobles,</HI> either of <HI>higher</HI> or <HI>lower</HI> Quality, but were made acquainted with the Design; and though some declined the Danger, yet most of them kept Counsel: Nay, many <HI>Re∣publicans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Republi∣cans</HI> also con∣spiring with them,</NOTE> who now were more displeased with the Tyranny of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> than the Lawful Go∣vernment of the <HI>King,</HI> joyn in the same Reso∣lution; namely, <HI>Overton,</HI> who heretofore had been Governour of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wildman,</HI> both Leading Men.

But these Men did but little Service being accustomed to detect things that were publickly known, and sometimes contradictory.

Then he shewed what he had done during his Go∣vernment: First, his Endeavours of reforming the Laws, having joyned all Parties to assist in that great Work: Next, his filling the Benches with the Ablest Lawyers: Then his Regulation of the Court of Chancery, and his Darling Ordinance for the Approbation of Ministers (which hindred all that list from invading the Ministry) by Men of both Persuasions,</HI> Presbyterians <HI>and</HI> Independents, &amp;c.
<PB N="187" REF="204"/>
<HI>And lastly, his being Instrumental to call a Free Parliament; which he valued, and would keep it so above his Life.</HI></P>

The truth is, the <HI>Officers</HI> of Three thousand Horse, and of no inconsidera∣ble number of Foot, frequently met in <HI>Somerset-house,</HI> and elsewhere, about the contriving and carrying on of that Design: But before the Matter came to maturity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which he smel∣ling out, pre∣sently dissolved the Parliament.</NOTE> by the Treachery of <HI>Pride,</HI> it came to <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Ears, who, by a ha∣sty Dissolution of the Parliament, prevented all those Machinations, and disbanded those Of∣ficers.</P>

<P>In the mean time, whilst He with great tran∣quillity of Mind suffered greatest Adversity, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had neither Rest nor Security in his Prosperity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwell</HI> con∣tinually dogg'd with anxious &amp; biting Cares,</NOTE> since the time the last Whirlwind had blown with so much fury and force; whe∣ther he was lashed by the Furies of an ill Con∣science, or terrified with growing Dangers, he never was at ease.

<P>Let us here mention one Passage, which tho' indeed ridiculous, had nevertheless almost cost him his Life. Being much troubled with the Stone, he used sometimes to swill down several sorts of Liquor, and then stir his Body by some violent kind of Motion, as Riding hard on Horseback, or Jolting in a Coach, that by such Agitation he might disburden his Bladder. Wherefore one day he took with him his Se∣cretary <HI>Thurlow,</HI> that they two by themselves might privately use this Exercise, in a Coach in <HI>Hide-Park.</HI> When they were come thither, <HI>Cromwell</HI> himself got up into the Coach-box,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Getting into the Coach-box to ex∣ercise his Body,</NOTE> drawn by six stout Horses, lately presented him by the <HI>Count Oldenburgh</HI>: But so soon as he be∣gan to snap his Whip, the Horses run away, and the Postilion who was to guide them being thrown off of the Forehorse, they fall a fret∣ting, and grow unruly, and not knowing their Master, toss their new Driver from his Seat upon the Pole;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He was very near being torn to pieces alive by Horses.</NOTE> who falling from thence upon the Ground, and being entangled in his Coat, was dragged up and down, till having received many Bruises, and a Pocket-Pistol going off in his Pocket, his Coat rent, and he escaped from the very Jaws of Death; a Troop of Guards that waited without the Park, hastning in to his Assistance, God Almighty thought it not fit that this Plague of <HI>England</HI> should thus expire,

though he was not far from the just punishment of his Crimes, that is, from being torn to pieces alive by unruly Horses. But this made work for Poets and Post-boys, and afforded plea∣sant Discourse in Taverns.</P>

<P>About the same time <HI>Cromwell</HI> sends one of his Bedchamber Envoy into <HI>Poland,</HI> there to Congratulate the Victories of the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>; with a present of four brave Horses, as a Testimony of his Affection.</P>

How are they to be accused of igno∣rance, since the matter of <HI>Fact</HI> is known by Evidence, who alledge, and by their Oath prove it in open Court? and the point of Law they are to be directed by the Judges who are versed therein. The Fact is better exami∣ned by a plain and uncorrupted Conscience, than <HI>cunning,</HI> that serves the ends of another.

<P>About this time great Troubles hapned in <HI>Piedmont</HI> in <HI>Savoy</HI>: for the Duke of that Coun∣try, by Military force, drove many of the <HI>Re∣formed Religion</HI> out of their own Habitations, not without Blood and Slaughter. <HI>Cromwell</HI> takes upon him their Protection, writing for that end to the <HI>Suitzers</HI> and <HI>French King</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwell</HI> as∣sists the Prote∣stants oppressed by the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI></NOTE> and having sent a Messenger to visit them, who might intercede for them, and relieve their Wants with Money.

with equal Courage, and overcome the Enemy, they must look out for and raise good honest Soldiers, that would fight meerly for Consci∣ence sake, or at least place such Officers of their Forces. Many have often heard him glory of that Advice. Having therefore obtained leave from the Parliament to raise a Regiment, by Letters or Messengers he invited the <HI>Honest Men</HI> (as he was pleased to call them) from among all the Soldiers in the several Counties, with whom he had had any acquaintance, and persuaded them to take on with him.

<P>The next thing brought under debate, is the Government of the <HI>Army.

they humbly desire, that for the future,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soldiers challenge to themselves ex∣travagant Pri∣viledges.</NOTE> <HI>No Soldier be turned out of place without a Council of War, nor that any Action be brought against a Soldier but according to Martial Law; that no Soldier be brought to Tryal for Murder, Theft, Sa∣criledge or Robbery, but in a Court Marshall; and that the Soldiers have the power of choosing their own General.</HI> These things are argued verbal∣ly before the <HI>Protector,</HI> and afterwards by Pub∣lick Writings and Declarations.</P>
<P>When <HI>Richard</HI> perceived that the <HI>Council of State</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> were tossed with these storms, he though it safest to betake himself to a <HI>Parliament,</HI> and try the aid thereof in his dif∣ficulties.

<HEAD>Part the Third: OR, THE HISTORY OF THE Composing the Affairs of <HI>England</HI> By the Restauration of King <HI>CHARLES</HI> II. And the Punishment of the Regicides, And the Settlement of the Church and State as they were before the Rebellion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Civil War of <HI>England,</HI> begun by a pernicious and fatal <HI>Parliament,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Recapitu∣lation of things past.</NOTE> raged for the space of eight years with various suc∣cesses of Battels; till the <HI>Royalists</HI> being in all parts worsted, and not able to keep the Field, <HI>Charles the First,</HI> the best of Kings, a Prince of most exal∣ted but persecuted Virtue, to avoid the victorious Arms of the <HI>English Independants,</HI> moved by ill fate or bad counsel, cast himself into the arms of the <HI>Presbyterian Scots,</HI> by whom he was, for a round sum of money, treacherously delivered up into the hands of <HI>English</HI> Traytors.</P>
<P>Nor was it long before he was a sad instance, that
<PB N="2" REF="242"/>
the Prisons of Kings are but little distant from their Graves.</P>
<P>For (what the flagitiousness of past Ages never attempted, and future Will hardly believe) the unfortunate Prince, to make way for the Usurpa∣tion of the Traytor <HI>Cromwel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">January 30. 1648.</NOTE> was forced by a sceni∣cal and mock-form of Law and Justice, to lay down his sacred head to be struck off upon a Block. The boldest Villany that ever any Nation saw; and a <HI>Parricide</HI> that all the World was astonished at.</P>
<P>But this Villany succeeding so prosperously, and <HI>Britain</HI> at length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September 3. 1650. <HI>and</HI> Sept. 3. 1651.</NOTE> and <HI>Ireland</HI> being subdued by victorious Rebels, as the Forces of <HI>Charles the Se∣cond</HI> were entirely routed by the defeats at <HI>Dumbar</HI> and <HI>Worcester; Cromwel</HI> the Traytor delayed no longer the execution of his long-projected Wicked∣ness. He knew full well, that the name of the <HI>Parliament</HI> was grown odious to the people, through the uneasiness of their flagitious and usurped Do∣minion. Turning therefore his Arms against his hauty Masters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 20. 1653.</NOTE> he turned them out of the House, as Objects first of his own contempt, and then of the peoples scorn. The onely grateful action he did to the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromw.</HI> takes upon him the Protectorship.</NOTE>And now <HI>Cromwel</HI> being Master, and impatient of a slow progress to Usurpation, grasps the Scepter, with the lofty Title of <HI>Protector.</HI> In the mean time he ruled more arbitrarily than a <HI>King,</HI> though he seemed to refuse the Title which he passionately a∣spired to. Whether he was more remarkable for Falshood or Valour, the Reader may judge, since Courage he had by turns and intervals, but was ne∣ver without Hypocrisie and native Treachery.</P>
<P>When for the space of five years he had filled all places with Slaughter, and Bloud, with Banishments, Robberies, and all sorts of Cruelty; being im∣placable to his Enemies, false to his Friends, despi∣sed

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s temper.</NOTE><HI>Fleetwood</HI> was old <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Son-in-law, of lit∣tle or no reputation in the War, but a stout Prea∣cher and Prayer: He hoped to have been Succes∣sour in the Government, after the death of his Fa∣ther-in-law; but being disappointed by crafty <HI>Oli∣ver,</HI> if he was not, because of that, glad, he was not at all displeased at the overthrow of his Brother-in-law <HI>Richard.</HI></P>

Nor was he thought to be displeased with the old man, so long as he hoped for a Successour out of his Family, and to be adopted in the Army, where his reputation was great. He secretly despised <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Relati∣ons, as too low and unfit for Principality; thinking that he alone remained worthy to be advanced to Supremacy. Which afterwards more <HI>secretly,</HI> but not more <HI>justly,</HI> he attempted, rather than obtained.</P>
<P>The awe of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> whilst alive, gave some

check, such as it was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deplorable state of the Commonwealth</NOTE> to the dissembled madness of the <HI>Democratical</HI> Republicans.

The furious unsetled Colonels, without sense or honesty, laying aside all care of Reputation or Justice, soften∣ed and fed their private hopes. The Power of the Rulers was mutually suspected, and the Honour of the Nation wholly slighted. And the same Army of <HI>Cromwel</HI> abandoning the Family of their Gene∣ral, perfidiously abolished the <HI>Protectordom,</HI> which by perjuries they had established as a brave and memo∣rable Constitution.</P>
<P>The Rabble also were so inclined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And madness of the People.</NOTE> that many de∣sired, and all accustomed to the Yoke of Bondage, suffered the <HI>Rump-Parliament,</HI> though of old noto∣rious for flagitiousness, and now for buoying up the aspiring Colonels.

<P>The old Souldiers of the <HI>King,</HI> and such as were devoted to <HI>Charles the Second,</HI> in the mean while, who had hearts to do and suffer any thing, rejoyced in secret; having without the loss of reputation, or degenerating from the ancient care they were sprung from, endured the calamities of Adversity, the long insulting and many Rapines of Robbers, and all the <HI>shams</HI> of Fortune, with an honest and patient Poverty.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="245"/>Though the settlement of <HI>Cromwel</HI> in the govern∣ment, and the unshaken fidelity of his Adherents, had so often defeated all their endeavours of restoring the <HI>King,</HI> yet they carefully eyed the dissensions and di∣stractions of the <HI>Fanaticks,</HI> and the turns and revo∣lutions of the Government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">From the con∣fusion of things the Royalists take hopes.</NOTE>And now the mutual clashings of the Rebels, gave courage to the <HI>Loyal Nobility,</HI> secretly to con∣trive the restauration of their Liberty; and under pretence of a free and full Parliament, the recovery of the just Rights of King <HI>CHARLES.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Enter∣prizes.</NOTE> For that end they made use of the assistance of some <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> an inflexible sort of men, a bad pre∣sage of a certain overthrow, since they are a kind of people that make use of good fortune, rather for the subversion than the establishment of <HI>Kings.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Booth</HI> himself, in the mean time, with 2000 Horse and Foot, took the Field, expecting the aid of all good men throughout <HI>England</HI> in so illustrious an Undertaking; but with more Loyalty than Fortune.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Rump</HI> is terrified.</NOTE>At the news of so sudden an Eruption, the Rump was terrified; and being doubtful of their New Government, startled at the present Commotions, apprehensive of future, and conscious of the greatness of their own Crimes, they were in fear of all men.

were many more besides him who hatched the same designes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parricides</HI> had no other hopes of safety, but in daring boldly; wherefore arming with expedi∣tion the fiercest of the Sectarian Rout,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepares to fight.</NOTE> doubling their Guards, and sending flying parties of the old Forces into all Counties and Towns, they no sooner smelt out, but they prevented the designes of the <HI>Royalists.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Booth</HI> had set a strong Guard to defend the Bridge over the River, and had drawn up his men beyond it, but still inferiour both in number and fortune.

<P>And the <HI>Cheshire</HI>-Insurrection was so convenient for <HI>Lambert</HI>'s interest, that he reckoned it amongst the favours of his prosperous fortune.

<P><HI>Monk</HI> in the mean time, being as yet, uncertain what to do, had many anxious thoughts: He fore∣saw, indeed, greater security under the <HI>Rump,</HI> but if the Army in <HI>England</HI> had the better on't, inevi∣table ruine; having long ago had experience of the hatred of <HI>Lambert</HI> and <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> though disguised in their looks: And besides the usual competition in rule, they were also looked upon as men of dif∣ferent humours and manners. <HI>Monk</HI> was for a plain and modest Religion; but <HI>they</HI> turbulent and violent in their pernicious Heresie.</P>
<P>Wherefore seriously weighing with himself the strength of the <HI>English</HI> Army on the one hand, and on the other the weakness of his own Forces, the

perfidiousness of many of the Officers, and the fic∣kleness of the Souldiers; he thought still that he might do better in War than in Peace, and so ha∣ving resolved against the worst, he hastened his march into <HI>England.</HI> When he had consulted a∣bout these things with his most intimate Friends at <HI>Delkeith,</HI> he goes to <HI>Edinborough,</HI> and there in a full Council of Colonels,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At</HI> Edinbur∣rough Monk <HI>harangues the souldiers.</HI> Octob. 18.</NOTE> he represents the new Trou∣bles of <HI>England: How that the Parliament was tur∣ned out of doors by the Officers in</HI> England, <HI>without a∣ny provocation, but through levity and an ambition of governing: That the</HI> London-<HI>Colonels having attem∣pted many bad things, resolved not onely to bear rule o∣ver their own, but the Forces abroad also: That it would be disgraceful to them to submit to the Com∣mands of another Army; That he himself was a Gene∣ral neither inferiour to</HI> Fleetwood <HI>nor</HI> Lambert; <HI>nor was the Army of</HI> Scotland, <HI>that had outlived so many Battels, less to be accounted than that of</HI> England. <HI>That therefore he was firmly resolved to march into</HI> England, <HI>to revenge the Right and Honour of the Par∣liament; that the Authority might remain in their hands who gave them their Pay and Rewards.</HI></P>
<P>When with much authority and greatness of mind, which do better than eloquence in a Soul∣dier, he had spoken to this purpose, the Souldiers were inflamed with Zeal and Resolution; and un∣der the command of so great a General, desire the signal to march.</P>

<P><HI>Monk</HI> received them all civilly.

<P><PB N="16" REF="249"/>The Ministers with affected flattery preached up the advantages of Peace, presaging from more than one instance, that the divisions of fellow-Souldiers, would be pernicious to themselves, and very advan∣tageous to the <HI>publick Enemy,</HI> intimating the <HI>King:</HI> and indeed their Presage proved afterward to be true.</P>
<P>But the mercenary and canting Tongues of those preaching Mediators, wrought no effect upon an old Souldier, who was so well acquainted with their juggling tricks.

<P>Few now were to be seen at <HI>Lambert</HI>'s door, and fewer within; nothing but silence, and seldom any Guards: He was no more General nor cause of the War; but where he hoped for <HI>Laurel</HI> and Triumph, he was fain to search a hiding place: so that with∣out any attendance, he speedily and secretly betook himself to <HI>London.</HI> So fallacious and uncertain a thing is Power, when it is too great.</P>
<P>A certain kind of Triumviral Power now exer∣ted it self in <HI>Britain</HI> under <HI>Monk, Fleetwood,</HI> and

<P>With almost the same gallantry <HI>Monk</HI> behaved himself in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as <HI>Caesar</HI> heretofore governed in <HI>Gallia</HI>; but out of their Governments <HI>Monk</HI> out-did <HI>Caesar:</HI> for the <HI>Roman</HI> being come into the City, offered violence to the <HI>Senate,</HI> and unjustly u∣surped the <HI>Dictatorship.</HI> The other entering <HI>London,</HI> under colour of restoring the <HI>Parliament,</HI> by a rare instance of Loyalty and Modesty, restored the <HI>King.</HI></P>

Fleetwood</HI> was jealous of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s ambition; and <HI>Lambert</HI> could not brook <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s authority: the one could not ad∣mit of an Equal, nor the other of a Superiour.</P>
<P><HI>Monk</HI> therefore was courted by Letters from both, as having it in his power to give the Government to what Party he pleased.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMongst the many Mercies of God to these poor Nations, your peaceable Restitution is not the least; it is (as you sad) his work alone, and to him belongs the glory of it. And I esteem it as a great effect of his goodness to me, that he was pleased to make me, amongst many worthier in your service, some way in∣strumental in it. I did nothing but my duty, and de∣serve not to receive so great an honour and respect as you are pleased to give me at this time and place; which I shall ever acknowledge as a high mark of your favour to me. Sir, I shall not now trouble you with large Narratives; onely give me leave to acquaint you, That as I marched out of <HI>Scotland</HI> hither, I observed the People in most Counties in great and earnest expectations of a Settlement; and several Applications were made to me, with numerous Subscriptions to them. The chie∣fest heads of their Desires were, for a free and full Par∣liament, and that you would determine your sitting; a Gospel-Ministry; encouragement of Learning and Ʋniversities; and for admittance of the Members se∣cluded before the year <HI>1648.</HI> without any previous
<PB N="30" REF="256"/>
Oath or Engagement. To which I commonly answered, That you are now in a free Parliament; and if there be any force remaining upon you, I would endeavour to remove it; and that you had voted to fill up your House, and then you would be a full Parliament also; and that you had already determined your sitting: and for the Ministry, their maintenance, the Laws, and Ʋ∣niversities, you had largely declared concerning them in your last Declaration; and I was confident you would adhere to it. But as for those Gentlemen secluded in the year <HI>1648.</HI> I told them, you had given judgment in it, and all people ought to acquiesce in that judgment; but to admit any Members to sit in Parliament without a previous Oath or Engagement to serve the Govern∣ment in being, it was never done in <HI>England.</HI> But al∣though I said it not to them, I must say (with par∣don) to you, That the less Oaths and Engagements are imposed (with respect had to the security of the com∣mon Cause) your settlement will be the sooner attained to. I am the more particular in these matters, to let you see how grateful your present Consultations about these matters will be to the people. I know all the so∣ber Gentry will close with you, if they may be ten∣derly and gently used; and I am sure you will so use them, as knowing it to be the common concern, to ac∣complish and not lessen our interest; and to be careful that neither the <HI>Cavalier</HI> nor the <HI>Fanatick</HI> Party have yet a share in your Civil or Military Power; of the last, whose impatience to Government you have lately had so severe experience of. I should say something of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> indeed <HI>Ireland</HI> is in an ill settled con∣dition, and made worse by your interruptions, which prevented the passing an Act for the settlement of the E∣states of Adventurers and Souldiers there, which I heard you intended to have done in a few days; and I presume it will be now quickly done, being so necessary at this time, when the wants of the Commonwealth call
<PB N="31" REF="256"/>
for supplies: and people will unwillingly pay Taxes for those Estates, of which they have no legal assurance. I need not tell you how much you were abused in the nomination of the Officers of your Armies there; their malice that deceived you hath been sufficiently mani∣fested. I do affirm, that those now who have declared for you, will continue faithful; and thereby convince, that as well there as here, it is the sober interest must establish Dominion. As for <HI>Scotland,</HI> the People of that Nation deserve to be cherished much; and I be∣lieve your late Declaration will much glad their spirits: for nothing was more dreadful to them, than a fear to be over-run with Fanatick Notions. I humbly recommend them to your affection and esteem, and desire the intended Ʋnion may be prosecuted, and their Taxes made proportionably to those in <HI>England;</HI> for which I am engaged in promise to become a Suiter to you. And truly, Sir, I must ask leave to entreat you to make a speedy provision for their Civil Government there, of which they have been destitute near a year, to the ruine of many Families: and except Commissioners for ma∣naging of the Government, and Judges to sit in Courts of Judicature, be speedily appointed, that Country will be very miserable. I directed Mr. <HI>Gumble</HI> (whom I lately sent to you, to give you an account of the affairs of the Scottish Army, and to make certain Proposals in their names) to present some persons to you, both for Commissioners and Judges, which he did; but by rea∣son of your great affairs, they were not dispatched: but I humbly now offer them to your consideration.</P>

<P>If what the General spake was unpremeditated,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monk</HI>'s Speech suspected by the Members.</NOTE> certainly it was well his upon: but how the <HI>Rump</HI> were satisfied with his Speech, the sequel will make it appear. Besides, his declining to take the Oath of Abjuration the day before, the freedom of his speech mightily netled the <HI>Rump-Abjurors,</HI> who
<PB N="32" REF="257"/>
looked upon him as a Dictator rather than an Ora∣tor, commanding rather than petitioning; and who had seemed as much dissatisfied with the trea∣chery of <HI>Fanaticks,</HI> as the contumacy of the <HI>Cava∣liers.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Abjurors</HI> in the mean time, those Piles in the <HI>Rump,</HI> who had the sole power in carrying of things, began to have jealousies of the sincerity of <HI>Monk</HI>'s intentions, and of the extraordinary affecti∣on of the people towards him; and having found an opportunity, they delayed no longer to make a tryal of his thoughts and hidden designes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Londoners</HI> refuse to pay Taxes.</NOTE>The <HI>Government</HI> of this <HI>Rump-Parliament</HI> was grown so contemptible and loathsome to the <HI>Londo∣ners,</HI> that an Order past in <HI>Common Council,</HI> That unless they had a free and full Parliament, they would not pay one farthing of Taxes: which so startled and incensed the guilty and timerous minds of the <HI>Members,</HI> that <HI>Monk</HI> hath forthwith severe orders to march into the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monk</HI> is sent into the City in Arms. <HI>Feb. 9.</HI></NOTE> commit twelve of the more sawcy Citizens to the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and by pulling down the City-Posts and Chains, Gates and Portcullices, in a military manner quell the boldness of the People: which if he did, then the disgrace and hatred would equally fall upon all; and that by that means they would prove <HI>Monk</HI>'s friendship, as if he refused, they might conclude him an Enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To which he offers violence</NOTE>Though <HI>Monk</HI> abhorred those cruel Orders of these <HI>Rulers,</HI> yet he marched into the City with armed Forces, and contrary to his own inclination, puts in execution the hateful Orders of the <HI>Rump.</HI></P>
<P>This unexpected Aggression of <HI>Monk</HI> astonished the City, and the People were in consternation at it, appearing first by a profound silence, then secret murmurings, and amazed looks; but there was more sadness than fury in the case, and the Town
<PB N="33" REF="257"/>
seemed rather surrendred than stormed. In the mean time the Souldiers had the chief command, slighting the Authority of the <HI>Mayor,</HI> and Dignity of the City.</P>
<Q><L>—Et nullos Comitatu est Purpura fasces.</L></Q>
<Q><L>—And no Scarlet nor Gold-Chain appeared.</L></Q>
<P>Now did the <HI>Londoners</HI> bewail their own credu∣lity, and the false hopes they had conceived of <HI>Monk</HI>; and desparing of humane assistance, they directed their eyes to Heaven, presaging no less than a per∣petual Bondage to the City.</P>
<P>This odious obedience performed by <HI>Monk</HI> to the <HI>Rump,</HI> put the Spectators to a plunge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The action of <HI>Monk</HI> is vari∣ously interpre∣ted.</NOTE> and suffered various interpretations. But for what he so far hazarded his own Reputation in obeying the <HI>Rum∣pers</HI> after this manner, or why, by so sudden a change of counsel and conduct, he endeavoured to regain their favour again, I shall not venture to de∣termine. The truth is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And is present∣ly displeased with himself for it.</NOTE> being either conscious to himself of the injury and affront done to the City, or having too much experienced the Arts and Trea∣chery of the <HI>Rump,</HI> and being no less prevailed up∣on by the Prayers of his Friends, and the Com∣plaints of all, he was sensible that his too great compliance with the <HI>Rumpers</HI> reflected upon his own Honour, and that the Indignity offered to the City, had raised him too much Envy.</P>
<P>The same night being come back to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and casting about what was to be done in this tic∣klish state of affairs, he called to Council privately some of the Officers who were his greatest Confi∣dents, and privy to his secret designes, and having formed a Letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He sends an angry Letter to the <HI>Rump. Feb. 11.</HI></NOTE> he therein angrily complaining of several things to the <HI>Rump,</HI> as, <HI>That his services done to the</HI> House <HI>were slighted, whilst the late Traytors,
<PB N="34" REF="258"/>
who were not much less Enemies to them than to the</HI> Commonwealth, <HI>had with them now much more cre∣dit and esteem than he. From whence else proceed your new kindness to</HI> Lambert <HI>and</HI> Vane? <HI>and your new offences against me? If the perfidy of the</HI> Fa∣naticks <HI>had still displeased you, why did you with so much respect receive yesterday that Leering Heretick</HI> Barebones? <HI>and the insolent Rabble of</HI> Sectarians, <HI>which lewdly in his company approached you with a dishonest Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>This kindness of the House shewn to a Rabble of Hereticks, is not simple (sincere). It is the common de∣sire of the whole Commonwealth, the general request of the People, Citizens, Souldiers, of every one, and all, That the number of the Members being fill'd up within a week, and then your sitting determined, you should give place to a new Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>These Letters he sent the next morning by <HI>Lid∣cot</HI> and <HI>Clobery,</HI> two Colonels to the <HI>House.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monk</HI> returns into the City. <HI>Feb. 12.</HI></NOTE>In the mean time he himself hastens into the City, that he might make amends for his fault, and wipe off the infamy of the foregoing day. Having sent a Messenger before to acquaint the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> with his coming, and mustered his Army in <HI>Finsbu∣ry</HI>-fields, he is entertained at a splendid Dinner in the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI>'s house. After Dinner the <HI>Mayor</HI> conducted the General to the Common-Council of the City, where in a full Assembly of the Citizens in their formalities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes a Speech to the Citizens:</NOTE> <HI>He declared to them his trouble to see what affronts were offered to them by Orders from the Council of State, which he obeyed; yet disliked that he was necessitated to comply with those Commands; but with a resolution always to run through the greatest dangers to serve them: That he had not forgot their kind Letter at</HI> Morpeth, <HI>wherein he affectionately con∣curred, but was forced to retire backwards, like a Fen∣cer, to make the better ground, and the more advantage∣ous

assault. That he had sent to the House that mor∣ning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And promises a new Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> that they should issue Writs for a full Parlia∣ment; and to this end he was come to stay with them, and see his desires fulfilled; and that they should put a period to their sitting by the sixth of</HI> May.</P>
<P><HI>Monk</HI>'s Speech was with delight and universal applause heard by the Citizens;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citizens rejoyce.</NOTE> and the name of a <HI>New Parliament</HI> so pleased the minds of the Peo∣ple, that the City which appeared desolate and de∣jected in the morning, seemed transported with joy at night, by the ringing of Bells and Bone∣fires.</P>
<P>Now was <HI>Monk</HI> in every bodies mouth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And honour <HI>Monk;</HI></NOTE> and the Multitude not able to contain their secret joys, pro∣claimed him the Honour and Deliverer of their Country;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reproaching the <HI>Rump.</HI></NOTE> praying for and blessing him in all pla∣ces. Then was the <HI>Rump</HI> loaded with the Re∣proaches and Imprecations of all, with so much freedom, that it seemed to be the first step to their Liberty, thus to despise their Oppressors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was offended at <HI>Monk</HI>'s Letter.</NOTE> Nor was this night revelling of the over-joyed People less boundless, than the Rage of the <HI>Rumpers</HI> was be∣fore, upon the reading of <HI>Monk</HI>'s Letter. They in great indignation complain, that the violence of old, offered by <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and more lately by <HI>Lam∣bert,</HI> was not more grievous, than the present-impe∣rious boldness of <HI>Monk,</HI> in prefixing a day to their dissolution.</P>
<P>But the old Commissioners, <HI>Scot</HI> and <HI>Robinson,</HI> being sent into the City to the <HI>General,</HI> they offer∣ed him the hypocritical Thanks of the <HI>Rump</HI> for his quelling of the City; and concealing their dis∣pleasure at his Letter, they promise a fuller Parlia∣ment: and that their dissimulation might be the more specious, they invite <HI>Monk</HI> again to <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI> to assist them with his counsel.</P>
<P>The General and his Friends gave them a doubt∣ful
<PB N="36" REF="259"/>
answer, as well knowing that the civility of the proud <HI>Rumpers</HI> was not for nought: However, it was the interest of both Parties to continue their dissimulation.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Commissioners</HI> upon their return, having brought advice of the joyful familiarity that was betwixt the <HI>General</HI> and the Citizens, the <HI>Rump</HI> smelt out <HI>Monk</HI>'s designe, and were distracted in their thoughts. Wherefore they forthwith set a∣bout the lessening of his power in the Army;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rump weakens <HI>Monk</HI>'s au∣thority.</NOTE> ap∣pointing a Committee of five for ordering the af∣fairs of the Forces; which if they could have gone through with, the <HI>English</HI> Army being altogether averse from <HI>Monk,</HI> they had certainly ruined his fortune.</P>
<P>So soon as <HI>Monk</HI> heard that he was made one of five <HI>Generals,</HI> being unaccustomed to affronts, and equally slighting the baseness and treachery of the <HI>Rumpers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He takes it in indignation.</NOTE> he took greater care of his affairs: And that he might not make use of the counsel of Ene∣mies and Traytors onely, he desires a Conference with the old secluded <HI>Members</HI>; upon whose sense and inclinations when he found there was more to be grounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And sends the secluded Mem∣bers to the house. <HI>Feb. 21.</HI></NOTE> and perceived them to be fit men for qualifying matters, and not averse from his own de∣signes in time, he sent them to the <HI>Parliament</HI> at∣tended by a guard of Souldiers.</P>
<P>The secluded Members in the mean time entring the House again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Abjurators depart.</NOTE> the baser and viler sort of the <HI>Ab∣jurors</HI> being now in despair, left the House. The rest being more moderate, continued to joyn with their restored fellow-Members in the administration of the affairs of the Publick.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Votes of the fuller <HI>Par∣liament.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Parliament</HI> being now increased in number, and the Vote of their own exclusion being in the first place repealed, they appoint <HI>Monk</HI> General of all the Forces in <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and order mo∣ney

<P>Whilst the Parliament was busied in the affairs of the <HI>Commonwealth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monk</HI> ac∣quaints the di∣stant Forces, with the re∣stauration of the Parliam. <HI>Feb. 21.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Monk</HI> in the mean time wholly taken up about the care of the Forces, having cal∣led a Council of his Colonels, dispatched Letters to all the Regiments of the Army and their Officers, that were quartered up and down <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> to <HI>certifie them of the reason of the readmission of the Members, with large assurances of their constancy to their old Profession and Principles; and that with∣out this Expedient there was no way to satisfie the Na∣tion, or raise money for the subsistance of the Army or Navy.</HI></P>
<P>The distant Regiments in the mean time wan∣ting Money and Necessaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They consent to him.</NOTE> and having tried the experience of both fortunes, chose rather to com∣ply, and have their certain Pay, than to stand it out, and trust to uncertainties.</P>
<P>But <HI>Monk,</HI> to make sure of the Forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And take an Oath to be true to the <HI>Parliament.</HI></NOTE> made them all take a new Oath to be true to the Parlia∣ment; which the Colonels and Officers of his own Army, and many of the <HI>English</HI> Forces willingly did: but those who refused or scrupuled, he dis∣armed and casheered. And now <HI>Monk</HI> had the sole power over both Armies, and received all Souldiers as bound by the same Oath under the same Gene∣ral.</P>
<P><HI>Monk</HI> before this had removed his Quarters from <HI>Whitehall</HI> to St. <HI>James</HI>'s: There amongst others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monk</HI> quarters at S <HI>James</HI>'s.

By his means <HI>Greenvile</HI> a Knight be∣ing introduced to <HI>Monk,</HI> and all company being re∣moved,
<PB N="38" REF="260"/>
he privately delivered him Letters from <HI>King CHARLES.</HI></P>
<P>Having read them, he makes an answer suitable to the times and the doubtful state of affairs, resol∣ving neither to say too much, nor to conceal all his mind; and so tempered his expressions, that he might seem to reserve a fuller answer in his acti∣ons. And this was the first step to the restoring the Government to <HI>Charles</HI> the Second.</P>
<P><HI>Greenvile</HI> returned to <HI>Brussels</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> with the joyful and expected news of <HI>Monk</HI>'s good in∣clinations towards his <HI>Majesty.</HI> But by how much the <HI>Parliament</HI> and <HI>Monk</HI> seriously applied them∣selves to the setling of affairs, by so much the more the bloudy <HI>Parricides</HI> used all their Arts and Trea∣chery, by sowing Sedition in the Camp, and raising Tumults amongst the Sectarians in the City, to stir up new Commotions; nor did Treachery end with the War.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Conspi∣racy of the Traytors.</NOTE> For the <HI>Abjurors</HI> having no more opportunity of doing mischief in the Parliament-house, kept Cabals and secret Conferences with the lately-disbanded Officers of the English Army, and being crushed in the head, stung with the tail.</P>
<P><HI>As to what may be gathered from the present actings of the Parliament, and the secret inclinations of</HI> Monk, (say they) <HI>the restauration of the Government of</HI> Charles Steuart <HI>is not far off: That therefore they thought to consider in time that their affairs were in a slippery condition; and that without their ruine and o∣verthrow,</HI> Charles <HI>would not mount the Throne. That the Trophies of so many Wars, the glorying in the assi∣stance and protection of God, and the actions of so many years, would not now avail them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That it was madness, after the slaughter of so many</HI> Royalists, <HI>the killing of so many</HI> Nobles, <HI>and the un∣parallel'd Crime of the Murder of</HI> Charles the First, <HI>to expect from a young banished man, and exasperated
<PB N="39" REF="260"/>
by a long Exile, a Pardon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1660.</NOTE> which God Almighty would hardly give for so many Villanies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That there remained then no remedy for them, but a daring boldness, whilst as yet neither the Authority of the</HI> Parliament <HI>in the House, nor that of</HI> Monk <HI>in both the Armies, was firmly enough setled. Let us therefore dare,</HI> say they, <HI>and re-attempt Murders, Rapines, Di∣sturbances of State, and all those Villanies that for twenty years past have so well succeeded with us; ra∣ther than tamely and cowardly deliver up our Liberty purchased by our blouds, into the power of an Enemy, who will the more cruelly be revenged upon us, that he hath been so often baffled and defeated by us. Let us either by greater Crimes justifie the past, or bury our misfortunes with our lives in the ruine of the Common∣wealth.</HI></P>

<Q><L>If we must sink, we'll drown the State,</L>

<P>Having thus concerted a Conspiracy, there wan∣ted onely an opportune <HI>Leader</HI>; but then <HI>Lambert</HI> being the person of greatest reputation amongst the Fanaticks, was thought the fittest to undertake that Charge.</P>
<P>Having therefore corrupted his Keepers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lambert</HI> e∣scapes out of Prison. <HI>April 9.</HI></NOTE> he made his escape out of the <HI>Tower</HI> by night; then lurking privily in the City, and consulting with the Ring-leaders of the Party, they concluded amongst them∣selves, O damnable madness! by corrupting the <HI>English</HI> Regiments, and raising Sedition in the Ar∣my, to renew a Civil War.</P>
<P>And so <HI>Lambert</HI> secretly posts to <HI>Warwick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He gathers to∣gether an Ar∣my.</NOTE> the place appointed for their meeting: Thither came

<HI>Axtell, Okey, Cobbet, Crede,</HI> and other bloudy Tray∣tors; where being joyned by Turncoats and the disbanded Souldiers of the <HI>English</HI> Regiments, whom they had allured into their Party, they sud∣denly make up an Army; and so the unhappy Ge∣neral is once more in command.</P>
<P>The first that gave <HI>Monk</HI> intelligence of <HI>Lam∣bert</HI>'s Insurrection was Colonel <HI>Streater,</HI> who was with a Regiment of Foot quartered in <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Council of State</HI> hearing of the escape of the <HI>Conspirators,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lambert</HI> is proclaimed a Traytor.</NOTE> proclaim <HI>Lambert</HI> and his Adherents Traytors. <HI>Monk</HI> in the mean time, lest leaving the City of <HI>London,</HI> he might bring the <HI>publick</HI> safety in danger, resolved to reserve his main Force for greater occasions, and to send in all haste, some Horse after <HI>Lambert</HI> to crush the designe in its In∣fancy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ingoldsby</HI> is sent against <HI>Lambert.</HI></NOTE><HI>Richard Ingoldsbey</HI> acquitted himself like a brave man, retrieving by a bold attempt the faults, that be∣ing a Colonel under both the <HI>Cromwels,</HI> he had formerly committed.

<P><HI>Lambert,</HI> before his Forces were ripe for Action, being thus unexpectedly beset, for a last proof of his Valour drew up his men in order to fight, lea∣ving the rest that was not in his power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both prepare to fight,</NOTE> to destiny; and <HI>Ingoldsbey</HI> did the like: both for some hours mutually expecting the charge.</P>
<P>Whilst thus they delayed to engage, it was re∣ported that <HI>Lambert</HI> made some overtures of resto∣ring <HI>Richard Cromwel,</HI> whom he knew <HI>Ingoldsbey</HI> to have been much affected to, that so he might save

Stakes: But he disdaining to see the force of that sce∣nical Prince plaid again, they must come to blows. Providence appeared in the engagement:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And do fight.</NOTE> for hard∣ly had they begun to skirmish, but that many of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s Horse turned to <HI>Ingoldsbey</HI>'s side; the rest either daunted at the desertion of their Com∣panions, or the force of the Enemy, took quarters and yielded.</P>
<P>Which when the Commanders perceived, they began to think of running. <HI>Ingoldsbey</HI> charging then home, put <HI>Lambert</HI> hard to it;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lambert</HI> is o∣vercome,</NOTE> who far below the great fame that he had acquired in Arms, his Courage sinking with his Cause, and forgetting his former Reputation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And taken.</NOTE> tamely yielded himself Priso∣ner.</P>
<P>With <HI>Lambert, Cobbet</HI> and <HI>Crede</HI> were taken; but <HI>Axtell</HI> and <HI>Okey</HI> making their escape, delayed, but avoided not their deserved punishments.</P>
<P>And now again <HI>Lambert,</HI> forsaken of his Friends, and a Prisoner, became sensible of his fortune. Yet this fresh madness of Rebels, had it not been sea∣sonably quelled by <HI>Ingoldsbey</HI> and <HI>Streater,</HI> would have again embrewed the Nation in Bloud and Slaughter, and turned all things into new Disor∣ders.</P>

<P>And now, on the five and twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> a new and more auspicuous <HI>Parliament</HI> assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new one met. <HI>April 25.</HI></NOTE> be∣ing made up, according to the ancient <HI>English</HI> cu∣stom, of <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Man∣chester</HI> was Speaker of the <HI>House of Lords,</HI> and Sir <HI>Harbotle Grimstone</HI> of the <HI>Commons.</HI> And this con∣junction of both Houses seemed a natural Prelude to the Kings Restauration.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What they were accused of.</NOTE>They were chiefly charged by the <HI>Attorney-Gene∣ral</HI> and the <HI>Kings Council,</HI> That they the aforesaid Traytors, and others guilty of High-Treason, con∣spiring with an accursed Army of <HI>Fanaticks</HI> had carried away to Prison, <HI>King Charles,</HI> securely trea∣ting a Peace with the two Houses of <HI>Parliament,</HI> which was almost concluded in the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> So that the House of <HI>Lords</HI> being abrogated, and the founder Members of the <HI>Commons,</HI> six and forty Villains that remained took to themselves the name of a <HI>Parliament,</HI> invaded the Government, and de∣creed to bring the King to a Tryal.</P>
<P>By whose authority these <HI>Parricides</HI> (an <HI>High Court of Justice</HI> being impudently constituted) had condemned and caused to be put to death the <HI>King of England,</HI> who was above the Laws, contrary to the will, and to the great grief of the People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They make an idle base de∣fence.</NOTE>To their Indictment, rightly laid and fully pro∣ved, having made many false and frivolous Answers concerning the supreme authority of the Parlia∣ment, which indeed in this case had no authority at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And are con∣demned.</NOTE> they were by the Verdict of a Jury of Twelve men found guilty of and condemned for High-Treason.

<P><HI>Harrison,</HI> rather of a base than low Birth, was the Son of a <HI>Butcher</HI>; bred at first a <HI>Pettifogging Country-Attorney:</HI> but in the heat of the Civil Wars, when the onely way to get into Power, was Fanaticism and Treason, he fled to the Rebellious Army; and there turning a furious <HI>Anabaptist,</HI> and advanced to be a Colonel, he grew very intimate with <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and his Competitor in Villany. But being a proud and haughty fellow, and a most de∣sperate <HI>Republican,</HI> he fell out, and was highly dis∣pleased with <HI>Oliver</HI> when he was made <HI>Protector</HI>; not that he hated the Tyrant <HI>Cromwel,</HI> but disdain∣ed to be outstripped, and to submit to one who from a fellow-Souldier was become his Prince.</P>
<P><HI>Carew</HI> came next and suffered the like death;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carew</HI> is hang'd. <HI>Octob. 15.</HI></NOTE> but his Relations, who had served the <HI>King</HI> in the Wars, obtained, as a mark of favour, the liberty of burying his body; which was the same night ob∣scurely performed.</P>
<P>The day following, <HI>Cook</HI> and <HI>Peters,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of <HI>Cook</HI> and <HI>Peters. Octob. 16.</HI></NOTE> in the same place, suffered the same punishment; where <HI>Peters</HI> by a drunken and base death, disgraced his infa∣mous life.</P>
<P><HI>Cook</HI> was an obscure, ragged, beggarly <HI>Lawyer,</HI> and ambitious to get a Name by any kind of Vil∣lany. <HI>Peters</HI> a Fanatical <HI>Tub-preacher,</HI> and the Jack-pudding of the <HI>Ordinances.</HI> Sometimes he was <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Independant,</HI> as the se∣veral
<PB N="56" REF="271"/>
Factions prevailed. He was the first of the <HI>Jugglers</HI> that from the Pulpit sounded the Trum∣pet to Civil War, a fellow full of talk, and had a knack of sporting the People into Sedition, with an insipid kind of Buffoonry and Lying, which past with them for Eloquence, and became a Crony of <HI>Oliver</HI>'s by a flagitious compliance. <HI>October</HI> the seventh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clements, Scot, Jones, <HI>and</HI> Scroop, <HI>executed.</HI> Octob. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Clements, Scot, Jones,</HI> and <HI>Scroop,</HI> suffered the same death upon the same Gibbet, without any regard had to a decent end.</P>
<P><HI>Clements</HI> was heretofore a Merchant in <HI>London</HI>; a lustful mercenary <HI>Traytor,</HI> who abused his <HI>Parlia∣mentarian</HI> Authority to Whoredom and Leache∣ry.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> brought nothing with him out of <HI>Wales,</HI> his native Country, but Infamy and an ignoble Ex∣traction; he was first a Robber, and for his exces∣sive wickedness preferred to be a Colonel, he mar∣ried <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Sister, who then enriched his Rela∣tions with the Spoils of the Commonwealth: nor was he less related to <HI>Oliver</HI> by Affinity than Villa∣ny; and to many men prejudicial by his ill na∣ture.</P>
<P><HI>Scot</HI> sprung out of a Brew-house, and amongst o∣ther Calamities of the Civil War, was admitted into the Parliament-house; and of all the Traytors perhaps, was the most inveterate Enemy to <HI>Charles the Martyr,</HI> of which Villany he bragg'd to the last: and so rejoyced in the Kings Murder, that he would have Posterity remember him as an Author of so great a Crime; and besides the murder of the King, was guilty of many other horrid Villanies.</P>
<P>Of all the <HI>Regicides</HI> that surrendred themselves, <HI>Scroop</HI> onely was hanged: for whether by indiscre∣tion, or obstinacy, he drew upon himself this ill fortune; or that a mans destiny is not to be avoi∣ded, I shall not determine: for after that he had
<PB N="57" REF="271"/>
surrendred himself, he seemed so much to justifie the Murder of the King, that he chose rather to be look∣ed upon as a Criminal than an humble Suppli∣cant.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Hacker</HI> and <HI>Axtell</HI> at <HI>Tyburn</HI> had the re∣ward of their Treason. <HI>Hacker</HI> formerly in <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hacker <HI>and</HI> Axtell <HI>hang'd at</HI> Tyburn. Octob. 19.</NOTE> and <HI>Axtell</HI> in <HI>Bedford,</HI> had kept shops.</P>
<P>The Quarters of the Traytors, (their Bowels be∣ing burnt) and their Heads were set up upon the Gates and publick places of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The fugitive <HI>Regicides</HI> being summoned by Pro∣clamation to appear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The punishment of the fugitive <HI>Regicides.</HI></NOTE> were afterwards by Act of Parliament declared guilty of High-Treason, and their Estates forfeited.</P>
<P>Nor did the just severity of the Parliament so pu∣nish the living, as to quite forget the dead: for the like Sentence of High-Treason was pronounced a∣gainst the deceased <HI>Ireton, Cromwel, Bradshaw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bones of the deceased raised and buried under <HI>Tyburn. Jan. 30. 1660, 61.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Pride</HI>; who having, whilst alive, usurped the Go∣vernment of the murdered King, they with no less impudence, when dead, were pompously buried in <HI>Henry the Seventh</HI>'s Chappel, the burying-place of Kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament therefore ordered their Bones and stinking Carcasses to be raised and buried un∣der <HI>Tyburn</HI>; and in this posthumous disgrace being dragg'd through the City, they had a Gibbet-inter∣ment.</P>
<P>I think it will not be amiss to give the Reader an account of the Original of the last named Tray∣tors, so famed for enormous Villanies; which here I shall once for all subjoyn.</P>
<P><HI>Ireton</HI> of a mean Extraction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ireton <HI>'s Cha∣racter.</HI></NOTE> was <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Son-in-law, and the Confident and Counsellor of all his secret Villanies; who, though to all others he was most hidden and reserved, yet to this man he opened his heart; as he on the other hand was
<PB N="58" REF="272"/>
reported not onely to have kept his Counsels, but also to have advised him to act many of his worst Villanies. He was esteemed the best Orator of all the Colonels, and had a canting kind of preach∣ing Rhetorick, more copious than eloquent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Pride.</NOTE><HI>Pride</HI> descended of unknown Parents, and was <HI>Dray-man</HI> to a Brewer; but within a short time, the affairs of <HI>England</HI> being in confusion, the rough-hewn Clown was dignified and made proud by the Title and Authority of a Colonel: nor is it certain whether he was the greater Knave or Fool.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Bradshaw</NOTE><HI>Bradshaw</HI> was of the fatal <HI>High Court of Justice,</HI> the more fatal President, a Lawyer of no account at the Bar, till being bribed by money, he got himself a name by a most execrable Villany. The Scarlet∣robed Brauler, and hardly more innocent than <HI>Pi∣late,</HI> surpassed the wickedness of all the rest of the Kings Murderers, by his boldness in condemning an innocent Prince, and adding malicious scoffs to the impudence of the Fact, without any Reverence to Captive <HI>Majesty.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Original of <HI>Cromwel.</HI></NOTE><HI>Cromwel</HI> indeed came of a better Race, but which he himself for ever disgraced. The ancient dig∣nity of his Family by the name of <HI>Williams,</HI> chan∣ged afterward by his Ancestors, in the time of <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> to that of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> had its origi∣nal from a Blacksmith.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>And his Man∣ners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Catalin</HI> luxu∣ria primum, hinc conflata egestas, in ne∣faria concilia opprimendae Patriae com∣pulêre. <HI>Flor. l.</HI> 4.</P></NOTE>His Youth was loose, infamous and debauched; but having run out his Estate, and from a prodigal Rogue turning Puritan, and then Fanatick, like a∣nother <HI>Cataline,</HI> incited by Beggary, he ventured upon the overthrow of the State.</P>
<P>Bearing a mind above a private condition, he still appeared as a private person, and had the art to set himself off undiscerned: He had a wonder∣ful dexterity amongst the Fanatick Rout, (in
<PB N="59" REF="272"/>
whose opprobrious friendship he chiefly delighted) of winning upon the minds of the <HI>Rebels,</HI> shaking his bald pate, and smiling with a deceitful Coun∣tenance; he was by Nature and Art excellently disposed for alluring the affections of the Dissen∣ters; nor do I know whether amongst mortal men there was even a cunniner Artist in pretended Piety, a wickeder or more crafty man, and bolder in at∣tempting any Villany.</P>
<P>But by what deceitful grinning Arts having o∣verturned the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and murdered the <HI>King,</HI> he raised himself to Supreme Power; many great Wits and able Pens have already described: Much he did in War, but more by Perfidiousness, Hypo∣crisie, Perjury, and Falshood.</P>
<P>More cruel he was than the ancient Tyrants, whose Manners and Examples he imitated: with <HI>Tiberius</HI> he was subtile and suspicacious, <HI>He had a crafty disposition with a jealous head,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. <HI>Annab. l.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 4.</NOTE> <HI>and delighted in none of his Virtues so much as in Dissimulation</HI>; more easily concealing Hatred than Fear. <HI>Nero</HI> he acted in the slaughter of his best Country-men, nor was he unlike him in driving a Coach. His Counte∣nance carried the bloudy <HI>complexion of</HI> Domitian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In vitâ <HI>Agri∣colae.</HI></NOTE> <HI>and a redness that fortified him against Blushing.</HI></P>
<P>But that he might not onely appear famous through Crimes and Villanies, by intervals he made a shew of some great actions; not from a principle of Goodness, but Ambition; nor out of love to Virtue, but Vanity, and future Glory. This alone was wanting to his fortune and our slavery, that he had neither a Son nor Successour able to match him.</P>
<P>Pity it was that that bold Orator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Milton.</NOTE> or rather Bagpiper, was out of the way at the shameful Obse∣quies of the Traytors, that the same hand which (reproaching all Kings in Latin) vindicated the
<PB N="60" REF="273"/>
Party, and justified in writing the Crimes of the <HI>Parricides,</HI> now might, though a surley lookt <HI>School-master,</HI> have either made a Funeral-Oration for the deceased, or sung their Praises in <HI>hanging</HI> Elegies; his Poetry surpassing his Oratory, especially when he treated of such monstrous subjects.</P>
<P>Strangers may perhaps wonder, and no less our Posterity at home, that such base and contemptible fellows, many of them Brewers, others who drank as they had brewed, and spent their Estates; and some again whose ignominious Poverty was a scan∣dal to the Nation, should overturn the flourishing state of <HI>England,</HI> and get to the top of Authority and Government.</P>
<P>Would we know the cause of it? These were the Spoils, and these the Trophies of Heresie; which taking its rise from the <HI>Sermonizing Presbyterian</HI> Ministers, increased by the <HI>Independants,</HI> hurried on by the Kennel of all the Sectarians, and by a kind of flying Contagion spread over all the <HI>Forces,</HI> could not be stopt till they had shed the <HI>Royal Bloud,</HI> subverted the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and made one ruinous heap of all good Subjects.</P>

<P>But fortune was more favourable to the Traytors that came in at home, than to those who fled a∣broad: for about that time Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> being Embassadour in <HI>Holland,</HI> had intelligence that three of the Fugitive <HI>Regicides, Barkstead, Okey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barkstead, Okey, <HI>and</HI> Corbet <HI>taken.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Corbet,</HI> being come back out of <HI>Germany,</HI> lurked in <HI>Delf.</HI> He therefore having obtained a Warrant from the <HI>States General,</HI> seized them, and sent them over to <HI>England</HI>; where being brought to a tryal,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Were hanged at</HI> Tyburn.

<P>They went all to death with a fanatical ostenta∣tion of Piety.

<P><HI>Corbet</HI> was heretofore an inspired prating <HI>Law∣yer,</HI> more skilful in the Principles of Fanaticks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corbet<HI>'s Cha∣racter.</HI></NOTE> than in the Laws; he got to be a Member of that long and black Parliament, and no man was more pro∣fessedly an implacable Enemy to the <HI>King.</HI></P>

<P>But that kind of stupid fierceness was more use∣ful to <HI>Cromwel</HI> than the cunninger knavery of o∣thers: for the Tyrant himself for the most part looked another way, and commanded the Villanies which he would not behold; so that this fellow, no doubt, was privy to the furious Councils of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and a trusty Minister of his <HI>Protectoral</HI> Cruelty: And so long as he was chief Jaylor to <HI>Oliver,</HI> the barbarous Villain was never startled at the sight of the Murders and Imprisonments of so many Nobles and worthy Subjects.

<P>The first advance he made in the career of his Villany, was in the death of the <HI>Earl of Strafford</HI>; afterwards being a great Incendiary in the Civil Wars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> and equally ungrateful and perfidious to <HI>Charles the Martyr,</HI> he cherished and strengthened the Party of the Traytors: and though more cau∣tiously than innocently, he was not present at the Condemnation of the <HI>King</HI>; yet after the Murder of <HI>Charles,</HI> he was very active in changing the <HI>Monarchy</HI> into a <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> and in abolishing for ever the Government of <HI>Kings.</HI></P>
<P>But at length, when <HI>Cromwel</HI> got into the Su∣preme Power, being ill-affected and envious against all Government by a single Person, he was negle∣cted and laid aside: But when the <HI>Rump</HI> came a∣gain into play, with the pretences of a <HI>Brutus</HI> or <HI>Cassius,</HI> he stept again to the Helm of Government, and was one of the <HI>Committee of Safety.</HI> He was, as to Religion, a man of an inconstant and unsetled mind, who professedly hating the name of a <HI>King,</HI>

<P>And whilst he still persisted in asserting his own innocence, not without reproaching his <HI>Judges,</HI> Sir <HI>John Robinson</HI> Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower,</HI> wanting patience to hear any more, interrupted him.

<P>Nevertheless, a War with <HI>Holland</HI> breaking forth, and the Laws being silent amongst the noise of Arms, the domestick Calamity grew so strong, that the Authority of the <HI>Justices of the Peace</HI> not being able to prevail against the obstinacy of the Rabble, the evil catched like <HI>Wild-fire,</HI> and all future Re∣medies

back again to the English Coast, giving them op∣portunity, if they had a mind to fight, to come out.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet comes out.</NOTE>But now the Commanders of the Dutch Fleet, moved with the disgrace of being blocked up, but more at the Reproaches and Execrations of the people, use all diligence to bring out their Ships.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The number &amp; Commanders of it.</NOTE>The Fleet of the <HI>States General</HI> consisted of above an hundred sail of Men of War, in seven divisions, which were commanded by <HI>Opdam, Trump, Car∣tener, Schramp, Stillingwolfe, Cornelius</HI> and <HI>John E∣vertsons; Opdam</HI> in the mean time being Admiral.

<P>The taking of the <HI>English</HI> Merchant-men was to the Enemies so joyful a presage of a future Engage∣ment, that directing their course towards <HI>England,</HI> they resolved not to expect the coming of the <HI>En∣glish</HI>; but, not doubting of success, to attack them in their own Coast. His <HI>Royal Highness</HI> in the mean time was at Anchor with his Fleet near <HI>Har∣wich</HI>; where so soon as he was advertised by his Scouts that the Enemy approached, rejoycing at the long wished-for occasion of an Engagement, on the first of <HI>June,</HI> setting his Fleet in order with all the expedition he could, he steers directly against the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Next day he came in sight of the Enemies Fleet: by night they were got near to one another; and on the third of <HI>June,</HI> with the day, the Fight be∣gan.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Sea-fight,</HI> June 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Fleet being drawn up, undaunted <HI>Prince

Rupert</HI> was in the Van; in the Body of the Fleet was the Duke of <HI>York</HI>; and the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> in the <HI>Rear,</HI> an expert Commander at Sea; the Ene∣mies Fleet being in order to engage them.</P>
<P>The first shot that was fired, was from <HI>Prince Ru∣pert</HI>'s Squadron: And both Fleets, as yet, fought with their great Guns at a distance. The <HI>English</HI> had the wind; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> on the other hand strove to gain, it being westerly: but whilst both Fleets strive for the wind, the order of the Ships engaged changing, the middle of the English Fleet came up with the front of the Enemies; and <HI>Law∣son,</HI> who commanded the next Ship to the Admi∣ral, bearing in amongst their Fleet, they came by a closer engagement to try the fate of both Na∣tions.</P>
<P>By and by the Admirals of both Fleets by chance engaged together. There was great slaughter on both sides, and it was a bloudy Victory to his <HI>Royal Highness:</HI> for whether by carelesness or our shot, fire got into the Powder-Room,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Opdam</HI>'s ship blown up.</NOTE> and presently blew up <HI>Opdam</HI>'s Ship.

<Q><L>Resigned his life to several deaths.</L></Q></P>
<P>The loss of the Admiral was attended with the overthrow of his Fleet; and the <HI>English</HI> redoubling their courage, bore in more furiously amongst the Enemies. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet wanted both strength and courage to continue the Engagement longer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> put to flight.</NOTE> and with full sail run for it. Now it was no more an Engagement, but a Pursuit, accompanied with slaughter, and the usual calamities of Fugitives:
<PB N="82" REF="284"/>
for four of the Enemies Ships, in the haste and consternation of the flight, falling foul of one ano∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutch</HI> Ships burnt.</NOTE> were by an <HI>English</HI> Fire-ship burnt all toge∣ther. Three more of their Ships being afterward in the same manner pestered together, were by the next Fire-ship likewise set on fire and burnt.</P>
<P>Then were many of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships taken, and more sunk; nor was there any end of destroying and pursuing, till it was dark night. The Pursuit continued next day with the same vigour, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> fled with the less shame, that they had the Duke of <HI>York</HI> to follow them.</P>
<P>This was a famous Victory, nothing short of the ancient Atchievements of the <HI>English</HI>; five thou∣sand of the Enemies being killed or taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Comman∣ders of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet killed.</NOTE> and <HI>Op∣dam, Cartener, Stillingwolfe,</HI> and <HI>Stamp,</HI> the chief Commanders of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, dying in the En∣gagement.</P>
<P>There were about eighteen Ships burnt, sunk, and taken. Many of the Enemies swimming in the Sea after the Ships were burnt or sunk, his <HI>Royal Highness,</HI> who is merciful in his anger, caused them to be taken up, having for that purpose or∣dered out Boats. <HI>For why should they die, who hardly deserved to live?</HI></P>

And though being in a dying condition, he could not make use of the Triumphant Victory to which he had largely contributed, yet he tasted of the pleasure of it. There were not many killed nor slain, and onely one Ship lost. And thus his <HI>Royal Highness</HI> brought home the Royal Fleet load∣ed with Triumph and the Spoils of Victory.</P>
<P>And whilst the <HI>States of the Ʋnited Provinces</HI> were taken up in punishing the cowardise of Comman∣ders, <HI>King Charles</HI> in the mean time conferred Ho∣nours upon his deserving Officers; and knighted <HI>Alan, Smith, Jordan, Meens, Tiddeman,</HI> and <HI>Spragg,</HI> for their brave and good services.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch Fleet,</HI> in the mean time fighting ill,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Ruyter</HI> is abroad at Pi∣racy.</NOTE> having been soundly-beaten, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in his Pira∣cies abroad had somewhat better fortune.

<P>But for this year the <HI>Dutch</HI> were sufficiently cowed, as no more to fight the Victorious <HI>English</HI> by Sea. Wherefore the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who liked better to overcome than to spoil his Enemies, seeing there was no hopes of any farther Engagement, spent the remaining part of the year on shoar.</P>
<P>But <HI>Sandwich</HI> being made Admiral of the Royal Fleet, set sail again towards the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> braves the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> and offered, though in vain, a second Engagement; but the Enemy could not be overcome, till they were found.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="285"/>The <HI>States</HI> in the mean time, after their Fleet of War was disabled and beaten off of the Sea, were in no small fear and apprehension for their <HI>East India</HI> Fleet, which was upon the way homeward richly laden; nor was the eagerness of the <HI>English</HI> less, to catch the Booty: But that Fleet having intelligence that <HI>Holland</HI> was blockt up by the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> and thinking it safer to shelter themselves in another Dominion, put into <HI>Bergen,</HI> a famous Har∣bour in <HI>Norway.</HI></P>

<P>A sharp Dispute continued for almost six hours, to the vast damage of the Goods on board the shat∣tered and torn Ships; and to no small loss on our side, especially from the Castle: but at length, af∣ter a proof of great but unseasonable courage, to prevent greater loss and slaughter, the Fleet retrea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed: and seeing they could not enjoy the spoils of the Enemy, they had the satisfaction to embezile and sink them, as if they had got, when the Enemy lost.</P>

was more credibly reported, by the infected Goods that were brought from <HI>Holland</HI> into <HI>England:</HI> so that when the Dutch Arms could not beat us, their Contagion overcame us.</P>
<P>After it had by the space of almost one whole year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And then ra∣ges over <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> raged in <HI>London,</HI> and swept away infinite numbers of people, it spread over many other and far di∣stant Cities and Towns of <HI>England.</HI> Nor could the Contagion be stopt by any humane arts or skill of Physicians, before it had carried away above two hundred thousand Souls within less than two years time; neither were the days and nights long enough for the dying to expire in, nor Church-yards big enough to contain the bodies of the dead, though they were heaped together into Graves.</P>

<P>The Nobility, Gentry, and rich Citizens, in the mean time, avoiding all confluence of people, lurked everywhere in Country-houses and Villages. The onely persons of great Quality that stayed in <HI>London,</HI> were the <HI>Duke of Albemarle</HI> and <HI>Earl of Craven</HI>; which was both a comfort and safety to the City, in so great a Desolation and Mortality of the Citizens.</P>

<P>Neighbouring Nations as yet looked at a di∣stance upon the bloudy War betwixt the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> But <HI>Louis</HI> the French King, powerful

in men and money, after he had for some time stood <HI>neutral,</HI> thought and hoped that the <HI>Dutch</HI> and we having mutually weakened and tired our selves out in War, he might have a fair opportuni∣ty to raise his power at Sea, though the <HI>genius</HI> of that Nation seems not to be cut out for that pro∣fession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War proclaim∣ed in <HI>London</HI> against the <HI>French.

<P>The affairs of <HI>England</HI> never succeeded better at Sea, than under the auspicious conduct of his Roy∣al Highness <HI>James Duke of York,</HI> who always pre∣fered the welfare of his Country before his own life; yet he was dearer to the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom,</HI> being the <HI>second hopes of Britain,</HI> than that his Princely person, born to the highest Honours, should be any more exposed to so mean and base an Enemy.</P>

the Fleet, and others lying at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> to stand over for the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> and hinder the <HI>French</HI> Fleet from joyning the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>I would to God it had not been judged of such an importance to make so great an effort to hinder the coming up of an Enemy, who would not have much injured us, nor assisted their Friends; nor was there any thing to be feared from the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, after the late overthrow of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>But they laying hold of the opportunity of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet being divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the mean time the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet offers <HI>Al∣bemarle</HI> an Engagement:</NOTE> and never fighting but by wiles, and upon the advantage of number, with fourscore and five Men of War, attack the Royal Navy, now much diminished in number. With <HI>Albemarle</HI> there were not above fifty Frigats; but he being a General without fear, unacquainted with flight, and judging nothing too hard for his fortune, despised the Enemy, which so far surpassed him, as if they had been inferiour to him in number, so confident a thing is Courage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And they fight. <HI>June 1.</HI></NOTE> and preferring Glo∣ry before Safety, on the first of <HI>June,</HI> the day being pretty far advanced, he drew up his Fleet and bravely engaged the <HI>Dutch.</HI> Here number strove with Valour; but the Sea being rough, the <HI>English</HI> could not then use their lower <HI>tire</HI> of Guns, which never failed to shatter and tear their Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Albemarle</HI> did great actions in this Engagement, and everywhere behaved himself bravely, being fear∣less amidst the thickest dangers, and bold to admi∣ration; for bearing down with his own Ship upon the Enemies main Fleet, he broke quite through them, furiously firing on both sides, till at length having given and received great loss, and being dis∣abled in his Masts, Sails and Rigging, he bore off. Part of the <HI>Royal Fleet</HI> defended the Duke, whilst he refitted his Ship; and the rest continued obsti∣nate in the Engagement, till they were parted by the night.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="287"/>In this Engagement four <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were burnt, and a Vice-Admiral and another of a less value, sunk. And the <HI>Dutch</HI> took three <HI>English</HI> Ships, who being separated from the rest of the Fleet, were engaged at a distance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Fleet</HI> in the mean time suffered most in their Rigging and Tackle; but all things by the diligence of the Sea-men being repaired in the night-time, next morning, the second of <HI>June, Al∣bemarle</HI> having called the Commanders to a Coun∣cil of War on board his own Ship, spake to them to this purpose:
<Q><HI>HAd we been afraid of the double number of the Enemy, we should have ran for it yesterday; but though we be inferiour to them in Ships, in all things else we have the better on't. Number made the <HI>Dutch</HI> bold, and Courage us; let us reflect upon that Fortune, upon that Valour which heretofore the <HI>Dutch</HI> have felt to their woful experience; we have the same Enemy to deal with, whom we have so often beaten, and made it our custom so often to overcome. Let our Adversaries find to day, that though our Fleet be divided, our Courage is entire; and when we consider our own Glory and ancient Renown, how much more honourable will it be to die not unrevenged upon the Seas, than to be carried Prisoners in our own Ships, as a Spectacle of Triumph to the <HI>Dutch</HI>? It is less dis∣grace to be overcome than to flie; and Death is to be preferred before Fear.</HI></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fight is renewed. <HI>June 2.</HI></NOTE>The Fleet thus encouraged, equally despising their own safety, and their too numerous Enemy, and being eager to retrieve their Honour, all desire an Engagement; and <HI>Albemarle,</HI> confident in his own Valour, and in the eagerness of his Souldiers, declined not the Fight; so that both Fleets fell to it afresh, and engaged Pell-mell.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="287"/>The <HI>English,</HI> whose courage is redoubled by dan∣ger, put the Enemy hard to it, though they had had a fresh supply of Ships, Men, and Ammunition from <HI>Holland.</HI> The Royal Fleet being incompassed by so many <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, had nothing else to trust to but to fight stoutly, and make way for them∣selves in the best manner they could, till at length many of the <HI>English</HI> Ships, being disabled in their Sails and Rigging, stood away, and left the rest to deal with and maul the Enemy. The <HI>Dutch</HI> sunk one Ship of the Royal Fleet, and we our selves de∣stroyed another that could not be brought off. The <HI>Dutch</HI> in the mean time had but one Vice-Admiral Ship burnt; and in this days Engagement with so numerous an Enemy, it was a harder thing for us to keep our selves from being beaten, than it was many times heretofore to have overcome them.</P>
<P>But after that with more than humane force and courage they had asserted their own Honour and the Glory of <HI>Britain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Royal Fleet thinks of retreating. <HI>June 3.</HI></NOTE> lest they might make that Engagement which the resolution of the <HI>English</HI> had rendred famous, by an inconsiderate boldness, to be thought rash; it was next day resolved in a <HI>Council of War,</HI> to send off first the disabled Ships, draw up the rest that were in a condition of fight∣ing, which were not above sixteen, to make head against the Enemy, and so to make the safest retreat with the Fleet they could.</P>
<P>Ashamed they were, and no less encouraged at the disgrace, that they who were used to command the Seas, should now decline the Enemy whom they had so often pursued; And <HI>Albemarle</HI> stood on the Quarter-deck, flying with threatning looks, and terrible to the Enemy in his very retreat: the boldest of whom that durst approach him, with his <HI>Stern</HI>-Guns he either beat off or sunk; <HI>nor did o∣ver-powered

Valour give o're:</HI> and they who fled, had m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re courage to flight than those that pur∣sued.</P>
<P>But now <HI>Fortune</HI> seemed to repent that she had not seconded the Valour of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. For during this sharp Engagement, the noise of the Guns had reached the ears of <HI>Prince Rupert,</HI> who at a great distance was in search of the French Fleet, though in vain; he therefore tacking about, made all the sail he could to come into the assistance of his Friends, inflamed with the desire of fighting. The sight of his Ships was as joyful to our men, as formidable to the Enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince Rupert</HI> opportunely re∣joyns the Fleet.</NOTE>But <HI>Albemarl</HI>'s Fleet had the ill fortune to take the nearest course to joyn the Prince, who was so luckily come: For the unskilful Pilates hastening too rashly, steered upon Shelves and Banks, where many struck; but though the rest got off again, yet the <HI>Prince,</HI> a Man of War that deserved better fate, commanded by Sir <HI>George Askeugh,</HI> being so far got on as they could not bring her off, was burnt by the Enemy; and <HI>Askeugh</HI> being taken, was af∣terward carried in triumph into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The Royal Fleet being now rejoyned, on the fourth of <HI>June</HI> give chace to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> daring them to another Engagement.

<P>The <HI>Prince</HI> with his fresh and entire Squadron had the Van, carrying in his looks the resoluti∣on of his mind: <HI>Albemarle</HI> followed after, spurred on with new desires, from the supplies of others,
<PB N="91" REF="288"/>
having received fresh Vigour to himself; but the Enemies Fleet kept at a distance, not daring to come to a close Engagement; until <HI>Prince Rupert,</HI> desirous to make an end of the matter, with his u∣sual undaunted Courage, fell in amongst the thick of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and sunk and put to flight many of them; and had not <HI>Albemarl</HI>'s own Ship been extream∣ly disabled in the former Engagements, and had not an unlucky shot of the last of the Enemies Ships, towards the evening brought the Mast of <HI>Prince Rupert</HI>'s Ship by the board, and so hindred the pur∣suit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet flies.</NOTE> They had been able to have given a far better account of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in this days Engagement, who now strove who could run fastest.

<P>The Enemy being now everywhere put to flight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Royal Fleet <HI>puts into Harbour.</HI> June 6.</NOTE> the <HI>Royal Fleet</HI> seemed the more joyful that they had conquered the greater dangers, and so stood over to their own Coast, and put into Harbour to have their Ships refitted, which was done with all diligence.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Dutch</HI> gave it out, that they had got the Victory, because they came off so well; and after that they had celebrated a Mock-triumph over the <HI>English</HI> at home, with a more ridiculous silliness, they bragg'd of their Victory a∣broad, to the scorn and derision of Foreign Na∣tions.</P>

<P>There was a hot Dispute on both sides for al∣most four hours; but the <HI>Dutch</HI> suffering more in their reputation than in other losses, tacked about, and made all the sail they could to be gone, the re∣port being,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> flie.</NOTE> that <HI>de Ruyter</HI>'s Ship gave them the ex∣ample of flying.

<P>A Squadron of Ships, under the command of <HI>Trump,</HI> stood it out still, and was attacked by a part of the Royal Fleet that was in the rear; but after a bloudy Engagement, they were forced in the night-time to follow the fortune of the rest, and shift for themselves upon the Coast of <HI>Zealand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jordan</HI> sunk <HI>de Ruyter</HI>'s Fire-ship; and in the Fight were taken <HI>Banker</HI> the Vice-Admirals Ship, and the stoutest Ship of <HI>Harlem,</HI> both which were burnt by the <HI>English,</HI> who were more intent upon the Battel than the Booty. <HI>Everts</HI> Admiral of the <HI>Zealand</HI>-Squadron, <HI>Tirich Hides</HI> of the <HI>Friesland,</HI> Vice-Admiral <HI>Conder,</HI> and six Captains of Ships were killed.

<P>The Royal Fleet was more troubled at this base flight of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> than they were at the dangers of the former Engagement; and they were vexed

that the cowardly running of the Enemy should have cut them short of a more triumphant Victo∣ry. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> always preferred a whole skin, though with a dishonourable flight, before Honour with danger.</P>

<P>But the <HI>English</HI> were unwilling to be idle upon the Dutch Coast, and therefore <HI>Prince Rupert</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> ordered out Sir <HI>Robert Holmes,</HI> a man of great undertaking, to the <HI>Ʋly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Holmes</HI> sails to the <HI>Uly;</HI></NOTE> who sailing thither, and having left a guard of Ships at the entry into the Harbour, he took with him five Fire-ships, and one Frigat, besides Pinnaces and Boats manned with Souldiers and Sea-men, and boldly entring in, he burnt all the Ships in the Harbour to the number of one hundred and fifty Sail, many of them <HI>East India</HI> Ships laden.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And there burn <HI>150</HI> ships.</NOTE> The Town of <HI>Schilling</HI> was afterwards taken and burnt, and the Plunder given to the Souldiers. And <HI>Holmes</HI> having shared the glory and danger with his men, came safe off, leaving behind him a bla∣zing Bonfire of Ships, and an amazement amongst the Enemies.</P>
<P>The Enemy having now wholly abandoned the Sea, the <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Albemarle</HI> steered their course back again to <HI>England,</HI> leaving the terrour of their Names behind them.</P>
<P>After a tryal of Fortune both ways,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet sails for</HI> France. Aug. 16.</NOTE> the <HI>Dutch</HI> prevailing neither with equal nor greater force, they apply themselves to the <HI>French</HI> for the assistance so

often promised and so often delayed, and turning their sails and desires towards <HI>France,</HI> they endea∣voured in another Country to raise up an Enemy to the King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the news of the Enemies being out again at Sea, the Royal Fleet presently set sail from <HI>England,</HI> and beyond <HI>Calis</HI> blockt up the <HI>Dutch</HI> on the French Coast; but a strong East Wind blowing, and the Sea being very tempestuous it was not safe for the <HI>English</HI> to keep out longer at Sea. They therefore bear away to St. <HI>Helens</HI> Point, a very fit place to intercept the French Fleet, that then was at the <HI>Rochell.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fire of</HI> London. Sept. 2.</NOTE>But so many fortunate successes over conquered Enemies abroad, were quashed by a sudden and most dismal Calamity at home; as if the beams of our shining Fortune were always to be intermixed and set off by Adversities: For on the second of <HI>September,</HI> a Lamentable Fire broke out in <HI>London</HI>; a sad Judgment of an offended God against <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> The Fire began in a Bakers house in the lower part of the City near <HI>Thames-street,</HI> amongst old rotten houses apt to catch fire, and full of com∣bustible Goods. The darkness of the night putting all things into terrour and confusion, increased the horrour of the Calamity. The Citizens being frightened, delayed the use of timely Remedies; and which was no small accession to the Evil, the people neglecting too much their houses, were too fatally set upon the hasty removing of their Goods, which were yet at length devoured by the nimble flames.</P>
<P>The raging East Wind that had much incom∣moded the <HI>English</HI> Fleet at Sea, did far greater damage in the burning City, by carrying the force of the flames through the greatest part of <HI>London.</HI> The Conflagration grew soon insuperable by the
<PB N="95" REF="290"/>
blowing of the Wind; which raising in a moment the fire from the bottom to the tops of the houses, and scattering flakes in all places, it grew too strong for the endeavours of those that laboured to quench it. Here the blazes of ruddy flames were to be seen, and there the crashing of falling houses to be heard; and which was the sadest Spectacle under the Sun, the doleful looks of so many Citizens, the wailings of desolate women, and the cries of chil∣dren and decrepit aged people: And in the for∣saken shops of the wealthy Inhabitants, numbers of Thieves and Pilferers, greedier of Booty than the fire, villanously skulked.</P>
<P>No man that had a sense of humane Miseries, could see, and not be affected with the dismal spe∣ctacle of the Ruining City of <HI>London.</HI> Now were there to be seen almost an hundred <HI>Churches</HI> con∣secrated to <HI>God,</HI> and many <HI>Hospitals,</HI> the Monuments of ancient Piety; besides other <HI>publick Buildings,</HI> raised at the vast charges of our Ancestors; the famed <HI>Sion-Colledge,</HI> and <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> and stately Cathedral of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> as sad Spectacles of the Calamity, either bu∣ried under their own Rubbish, or standing Monu∣ments of the devouring flames.</P>
<P>Whilst all things else in the <HI>Exchange</HI> were con∣sumed, without sparing the many Statues of our Kings, onely that of <HI>Gresham</HI> the Founder stood, to bewail the Ruines of his own Fabrick: so kind was Fate to the fame and memory of the liberal Doner.</P>
<P>The <HI>King,</HI> whose high-born Soul was above the Vicissitudes of humane Contingencies, could not but with grief and sorrow behold the lamentable Calamity of his wretched Subjects, and native Ci∣ty, exhorting, comforting, and advising them in their greatest difficulties: And therefore he ordered,
<PB N="96" REF="291"/>
that the next houses to the fire should be blown up, that a void space being made betwixt the Buildings, the remaining part of the City, that which still stood, might be saved; this being the last Remedy that could be used.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke of York</HI> also, and many of the Nobility, praised and encouraged the forward, assisted the di∣stressed, and gave a generous example to all by the vigorous resistance they made against the devouring flames.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fire is put out, <HI>Sept. 4.</HI></NOTE>After that the Conflagration had continued four days, to the inestimable losses of the Citizens, and had burnt down thirteen thousand houses, it was at length stopt more at the direction of Divine Provi∣dence, than by any humane Arts or Means.</P>
<P>The more loyal part of the Citizens, affected with the <HI>Kings</HI> sorrow more than their own, put an high value upon his Royal Compassion towards them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fictions of <HI>Fanaticks</HI> con∣cerning the Fire.</NOTE> But the <HI>Fanatical</HI> Clubs, who turned even the Calamities of their Country into Reproaches, could scarcely forbear to miscal the Judgment a Command; or at least did buz it about, that the <HI>Kings</HI> Guards were a hindrance to those who la∣boured to put out the fire; but the commoner sur∣mise was, that some <HI>French</HI> Agents had fired the City: And many reasons were by fear or envy sug∣gested to confirm the Treachery; nothing being more usual amongst the common People, than to make all Casualties Designes.</P>
<P>But those who still remembred the insolent Rage of the <HI>Londoners,</HI> was the first cause of the Misfor∣tunes of <HI>Charles the Martyr,</HI> that the City was pol∣luted with sacred Bloud, had beheld the sad fate of the King, and that some of the Citizens had called for, and others permitted the murder of <HI>Charles,</HI> humbly acknowledged the avenging hand of <HI>God</HI> in the Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="291"/>This was the issue of that memorable fire of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>; which for above two thousand years had been rising to that greatness, which now it could hardly bear. A City impregnable against all the Efforts of so many foreign Enemies, and civil Broils; could no otherways be ruined but by the breaking out of a Fire amongst old wooden Buil∣dings that were but too apt fewel for the flames.</P>
<P>Yet after the City was destroyed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liv. <HI>l.</HI> 5.</NOTE> the <HI>Londoners</HI> bore up with greater resolutions than the <HI>Romans</HI> did of old, when after the Conflagration made by the <HI>Gaules,</HI> they removed to <HI>Veii:</HI> nor did any man, despairing to see <HI>London</HI> again rebuilt, talk in the least of changing his habitation; but the Ci∣tizens crowding themselves into Booths and new-made Deal-board houses, or into Dwellings in the Suburbs, took their measures about the building of a new City.</P>
<P>The approaching Winter now put an end to all Naval Engagements for this year;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleets put into Harbour.</NOTE> so that both Fleets, the <HI>Dutch</HI> and ours, put into Harbour and were laid up; and left the Privateers on each side to molest and take Merchant-men at Sea.</P>

<P>So that without putting himself to the charge of a Fleet this Summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. keeps his Fleet at home;</NOTE> he was advised to order some Frigats to cruise in the Scottish Seas, and others in the West about <HI>Plimouth,</HI> thereby on all hands to shut up the <HI>British</HI> Ocean.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> by surprize fall upon the Kings Fleet. <HI>June 10.</HI></NOTE>But the <HI>English</HI> trusting to a Truce or Cessation of Hostilities, in order to a Pacification, laid aside all thoughts of War, and the Guard-ships were far off at Sea: A part of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet in the mean time entering <HI>Chatham</HI>-River, and having forced the Garrisons on the shore, and broken the Iron-Chain that was too weak to make a resistance, fell upon the Kings Fleet, which had often chased them, ly∣ing mored in the River, unrigged, and unprovided of Sea-men and Souldiers.</P>
<P>Our Frigats were burnt by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fire-ships, and others snatched, not carried away in triumph, to the reproach no less of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Knavery, than of our own vain Security; a loss so much the grea∣ter, by how much it cost the Enemy the less.</P>

<P>The <HI>King</HI> was not a little inclined to facilitate the profitable Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The building of <HI>London</HI> is taken into con∣sideration.</NOTE> that the Citizens might have time to rebuild the City: And the War being now over, he made it his care to erect to himself Tro∣phies of Glory, upon the Ruines and Rubbish of <HI>London</HI>; instead of a wooden City which he had lost, laying the foundations of one of Brick that might more powerfully resist the flames. Nor were the Citizens allowed to build at their plea∣sure, but the streets being first staked out, and en∣larged on each side, every one built their houses in a strait and equal front; <HI>London</HI> rising again with so much beauty and uniformity, that the loss of the old City was hardly regreted.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Birth and Extraction.</NOTE><HI>George Monk,</HI> the Son of a Knight, was born in <HI>Devonshire</HI> in the West of <HI>England,</HI> in the year One thousand six hundred and eight: He had an elder Brother who inherited his Fathers Estate and Ho∣nour; and a younger, who being bred a Scholar, after the Restauration of the <HI>King,</HI> was made Bishop of <HI>Hereford.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He followed the Wars in his youth.</NOTE><HI>George</HI> the middlemost pushing his Fortune in the Camp, followed the Wars; wherein he was first initiated in his youth at <HI>Cadis</HI> against the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> and shortly after in an Expedition against the <HI>French</HI> at the Isle of <HI>Ré,</HI> both unfortunate in their issue; but with better success he served under the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> The Civil Wars afterwards breaking out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋnder <HI>Charles the First</HI> he served in the <HI>Scottish</HI> War.</NOTE> occasioned first by the ac∣cursed madness of the <HI>Scottish</HI> Presbyterians, he re∣turned into <HI>England,</HI> and listed himself under <HI>Charles</HI> the First, who then marched against the <HI>Scots,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Ireland</HI> also</NOTE> and next year after was made a Colonel in the Army against the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels.</P>
<P>But the Civil War of <HI>England</HI> raging more furi∣ously afterwards, whilst the Parliament called in the <HI>Scots,</HI> their Brethren in Iniquity, to their assistance; the King on the other hand having made a Truce with the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels, called over his Forces from <HI>Ireland,</HI> for his own defence at home: and <HI>Monk</HI>

being one of the Commanders of that Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1669, 70.</NOTE> with the rest joyned the King at at <HI>Oxford</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He joyns the K. at <HI>Oxford.</HI> Is taken by the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and made pri∣soner in the Tower of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE> but whilst by orders from the <HI>King</HI> he mustered the Irish For∣ces in the Camp, he was unexpectedly surprized and taken by <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who served the <HI>Parliament</HI>; and being carried to <HI>London,</HI> lay there almost four years Prisoner in the Tower. Whilst he was there shut up and in distress, the <HI>King</HI> sent him secretly an hundred Pieces of Gold; which considering the streights his <HI>Majesty</HI> was then put to, was no small Argument of his Royal Affection towards him.</P>
<P>But being at length tired out with an irksome imprisonment, and, for the sake of liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He takes on with the <HI>Par∣liament;</HI></NOTE> chan∣ging sides, he took in with the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and went again over into <HI>Ireland</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And goes to <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> where he did many brave actions against the <HI>Irish</HI> Rebels, not without Presages of becoming sometime a great General, as being the onely person who seemed to have carried with him Honesty and Civility to the Civil War.</P>
<P>Here it was that first of all he gained the good esteem of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> who then commanded the <HI>Par∣liament</HI>-Forces in <HI>Ireland,</HI> having performed an action more advantageous to his General, than ho∣nourable to himself. The <HI>Irish</HI> War being ended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marches with <HI>Cromwel</HI> into <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> the Summer following he marched with <HI>Cromwel</HI> against the <HI>Scots,</HI> and did not a little contribute to his fortunate Successes in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

five years: until Quarrels and Animosities happen∣ing at <HI>London</HI> betwixt the <HI>Rumpers</HI> and <HI>Colonels</HI> of the Army, he laid hold on the occasion for restoring of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>But at what time first he framed the designe of restoring <HI>Charles</HI> to the Throne, I shall hardly pre∣sume to determine: Cavillers, and those that make the worst of things, gave it out, that his dutiful ser∣vices to the <HI>King</HI> were but fortuitous; but they who judge impartially, affirm that it was a designe laid many years before. Certainly the best of <HI>Kings,</HI> more mindful of the effects of his Loyalty, than of its beginning, received the duty of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> as ex∣traordinary and kind services, and honourably and liberally rewarded them.</P>
<P>The year before his death, he fell into a <HI>Dropsie</HI>; and being weary of the ordinary methods and ad∣vice of Physicians, he made use of a certain Quack-Medicine, which in appearance recovered him; but his body being opened after his death, a great deal of Water was found in his Bowels, and much congealed Bloud in both the Ventricles of his Heart, and other neighbouring Vessels: For the motion both of the Heart and Bloud being weaken∣ed by an inveterate Dropsie, gave occasion to the stagnating of the chylous juyce about the Heart; which stopping the Fountain of the circulating Bloud, put at length a stop to his last breathings for life.</P>
<P>The Marriage of his onely Son was in a manner the last thing he minded in this life; who a few days before his death was married to the Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Ogle,</HI> and Grand-daughter to the Duke of <HI>Newcastle</HI>; thereby to settle, as well as honour, his Family by an Alliance with so Noble a House.</P>
<P>After he had seen <HI>Britain</HI> rejoycing in Triumphs,
<PB N="105" REF="295"/>
beheld <HI>Charles</HI> confirmed in the Throne by ten years happy Reign, and after he had administred the greatest Offices of Trust under the King, both in Peace and War, being upwards of sixty years of age, he yielded to Destiny, which he willingly and undauntedly submitted unto; that after the Tro∣phies of a past Life, he might at length triumph o∣ver Death.</P>
<P>He left but one onely Son, the Illustrious Inheri∣tour of his Fathers Fame, hopeful to the State, and cherished by the King as his own. <HI>Charles</HI> who had often visited and condoled with him in his sick∣ness, was with him to the last, and expressed the same affection for dying <HI>Albemarle,</HI> that he had testified to him during his life.</P>
<P>From <HI>Somerset</HI>-house, where he had lain in state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Solemnity of his Funerals</NOTE> he was with a splendid pomp of solemn Funerals at the <HI>Kings</HI> charges conveyed to <HI>Westminster</HI>-Abbey, and there amidst the Tears and Condolings of all good men, interred amongst the August Monuments of Kings, being the last Triumph due to his me∣mory.</P>
<P>They who are curious to have a description of the shapes and countenance of so great a man, may know; that he was a person more graceful than beautiful; of a middle stature, strong and well comparted, with a comely presence; and of a com∣posed, rather than severe or stern, aspect.</P>
<P>He may easily be reckoned a most valiant <HI>General</HI> in War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Courage.</NOTE> not onely to be compared to the chief Com∣manders of his own age, but to the most renown∣ed Warriours of elder times; and of so great re∣putation he was in Military affairs, that the modest∣est do acknowledge too great a Courage in <HI>Albe∣marle.</HI> He spent almost his whole life in Arms, and at length growing old amidst Victories, he be∣came gray-headed under a Helmet.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="296"/>In <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> by Sea and by Land, so happy was <HI>Albemarle,</HI> that Fortune traced out for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Prudence,</NOTE> Honour, Renown, and Titles.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And Modesty.</NOTE>He had a Modesty that set off all the other Vir∣tues of his Mind; nor was he ever heard to brag of what he had done or deserved.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. <HI>Hist. l.</HI> 3.</NOTE>Nor after the Restauration of <HI>Charles,</HI> did he behave himself as a Colleague in the Government, as <HI>Mucianus</HI> was of old reported to have done to <HI>Vespasian,</HI> but as a Servant; neither did he ever boast, that having the Power in his own hands, he had bestowed it upon another; whereby he burned, to his glory, the Arrogance of the <HI>Rump,</HI> and the Impudence of <HI>Cromwel:</HI> his Loyalty inclining him more to give up, than his Ambition to retain the Government.</P>
<P>We may, moreover; reckon <HI>Albemarle</HI> happy, not onely in the greatness of the Action, but also in the seasonableness of the Service: That he brought back the Government to a Prince of so just and good a temper, who put so true an estimate upon his Loyalty, and under whom it would never be unsafe nor dangerous to deserve the most: <HI>For good Offices are acceptable,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacit. <HI>Annal. lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> especially to Kings, <HI>so long as the obliged think they may be able to requite them; but when they are too great to be rewarded, instead of Thanks they procure Hatred: And it is rare, and al∣most

unusual, for Princes to think themselves obliged; or if they think so, to love their Benefactors.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. <HI>Panegyr.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Peace being now established at home, and <HI>Janus</HI> his Temple shut, <HI>Albemarle</HI> departed the more joy∣fully out of this life, that when he left no Troubles in <HI>Britain,</HI> yet he left behind him a Love for him∣self in the hearts of all good men: so much the more wanted, that he had taken care that nothing should be wanting, having left nothing in the State but his own death to be bewailed; the <HI>King</HI> flourishing in his Government, and the Loyalty of the <HI>Parliament</HI> as yet vieing with the modesty of the <HI>Prince.</HI> Every one enjoyed the happiness they desired at home, and Peace with all Nations abroad, till the League-breaking <HI>Dutch</HI> again provoked the English Arms.</P>
<P>But the Actions of that War, the steddy Fortune of the <HI>British</HI> Nation, and the future Triumphs of <HI>CHARLES,</HI> I have set aside as a subject for my more advanced years.</P>
