<P>THis little Piece of History has stuck in the Birth well nigh a whole year; and at last is forced to come forth an im∣perfect Embryo, through the unhappy Midwifry of the Press.</P>
<P>Yet for thy encouragement, thou oughtest to know, That there is none such ever yet extant in the English Tongue. For, for the first Part; there is, <HI>(1.)</HI> Not a more modern and later History of <HI>Chri∣stendom</HI> in English; Nor <HI>(2.)</HI> a better in so small a Volumn: <HI>viz.</HI> None that gives a better account of the last fore-going, and this present Age, (which two chiefly concern us to know) that is, of the last considerable Affairs of the World, and present state of things. We say, there is none extant, of the like nature, so short and com∣prehensive.</P>
<P>And for the Second Part, It is the most wonderful strangest Hi∣story ever yet known in the World, in the English, yea, or any other Language. And indeed, not to be parallel'd by all History and An∣tiquity. Whether those Prophetical Revelations be from GOD, Man, or the Devil; yet they exceed all comparison. If they be from GOD, they are the strangest and most miraculous, ever since the Apostles days. If they be Delusions and Imaginations of Man, they are the strangest ever suffer'd, or invented by Man. If lastly, Devices, Fascinations, and Bewitchings of the Devil, (transform∣ing himself into an Angel of Light, &amp;c.) they are the strangest still; and the least Footsteps of his Cloven Foot to be discerned, that ever was in any of his Juggles. Onely we have been unhappily hindred by the Press, from giving you a short view and taste of the Prophecies themselves, as was really intended.</P>

And these two things may perhaps help to make it go down with the Reader, as it is, notwithstanding all its faults. For 'tis con∣fess'd, there are many Defects, procur'd through manyfold Occasi∣ons, not fit here to be mentioned.

<HEAD>Of the Advantages of <HI>Europe,</HI> in comparison of other Parts of the Universe.</HEAD>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> compar'd with other Parts, and former Times, for Arms, Arts, Commerce, and Religion. The preheminence of Empire and Arms. The preheminence of Arts and Sciences. The <HI>Chinois</HI> high esteem thereof. Of <HI>Riccius</HI> and <HI>Adams,</HI> Jesuites there.

The preheminence of Religion, or Priviledge of Christendom.
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Christendom the Glory of <HI>Europe.</HI> All its Advantages founded on Christianity, and Disadvantages on Pagan-and-Anti-chri∣stianism. Shameful Dissentions of Christians and Christian Princes and States. Lamentable Disorders, Persecutions, and Inquisitions for Religion and Conscience in <HI>Europe.</HI> Liberty of the same commended. Revolutions of the World. Present flourishing of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EUROPE is at this day the most flourising part of the Universe, for Empire, Religion, and Learning, Arts and Arms, and all the high distinctions of Hu∣mane kind. And as she now exceeds all other Parts; so the present all former Ages and Generations. It is not our pur∣pose at present in this General Table to make Comparisons, and set her off by the others sad countenance: but onely, in first drawing some plain and rude Lineaments, to expose to general view her present Portraiture and Appearance; with some prospect of her future.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> then might be compar'd either with other parts, or former Times of the World; and every way we should find her to excel. For though for largeness of extent she yeilds both to <HI>Africa</HI> and to <HI>Asia;</HI> yet she surpasses them in polite∣ness, and they all seem rude and barbarous in comparison; and has got those advantages and felicities above them, that all their Riches cannot equal. And if for vastness of single Empire, and Treasure, and dependencies thereon, she cannot come in competition with the times of the <HI>Roman</HI> Greatness, yet take her divided, and all her parts together, and she far exceeds them. And by how much her Empire since has been disposed into divers hands; by so much have her several parts been more puissant and flourishing. The whole Glory of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> then was contracted into a very narrow compass and one little corner onely, and (as I may say) Toe of <HI>Italy.</HI> For what was <HI>England, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> &amp;c. to w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
are now? surely infinitly more inglorious and despicable. She could not then look down upon her Feet and inferior parts, and not be like the Peacock, ashamed in the height of all her pride.</P>
<P>For if we should compare her, for Arts or for Arms, for the Virtues of War and of Peace, and therein all things else, (her Courts, her Camps, her Schools, her Cities, and her Fields) we should find no degrees of comparison, nor room in this Table. We will only touch upon things loosly here, as besides our present intent.</P>
<P><HI>Asia</HI> perhaps has shewn <HI>Europe</HI> that prodigious Art of Pow∣der and Cannon: But <HI>Europe,</HI> in revenge, has requited her with another as great, and by the Chard and Compass taught her, and the World besides, the use of that Invention. For with her Ordinance and Men of War, she has secur'd all the Coasts both of <HI>Persia,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> and those moreover of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and of <HI>Peru.</HI> She has quell'd the <HI>Sophies</HI> and the <HI>Mogulls,</HI> and seiz'd on their Harbours, and utterly destroyed the vast Empires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and the <HI>Ynca's.</HI></P>
<P>Those grand <HI>Heroes</HI> of the first and second Monarchy, and of the two last also, so nois'd of in History, never drove their Conquests so far as we. And all the Exploits of a <HI>Cyrus</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> of a <HI>Cambysus</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> of a <HI>Darius</HI> and his Sons in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and not long since of a <HI>Tamberlane</HI> in all three, no not of an <HI>Alexander</HI> and of a <HI>Caesar</HI> themselves, come not near the bold courses and Enterprizes of our Western People, who are seiz'd on all the Coasts of the Ocean, and make all the Pu∣issances of the two Continents to tremble. And they may be parallel'd with a <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> with a Great <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> with a <HI>Gustavus</HI> of <HI>Swede,</HI> and a Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Graecian</HI> built his Glory, and erected Triumphs of Vi∣ctory, and Trophies of Honour, upon the delicacy of the <HI>Per∣sian,</HI> and nakedness of the <HI>Indian;</HI> and the <HI>Roman,</HI> for the most part, upon the division or rudeness of the Nations, and weak∣ness
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
of the poor barbarous and undisciplin'd people. 'Twas easier then to over-run a Kingdom, than now to take a Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Asians</HI> generally are sunk into laziness, effeminacy and cowardize. 'Tis not many years since, that under the Conduct of a <HI>Degesfield</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> ten <HI>Christians</HI> have beat an hun∣dred <HI>Turks.</HI> The Cavalry, the Infantry, the Fortifications, the Engines, the Instruments and Weapons of War, offensive and defensive; the Stratagems and Plots, the Military Discipline and Skill, the War-Ships, or Men of War, and Fire-Ships, is beyond all former times, or other parts of the World. <HI>Candia</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> alone, at this day, is a notorious instance of the particulars. The Ships and Sea-Fights of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are not to be match'd by all Antiquity, or other Parts of the World.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> is able to raise 200000 men, and scarce miss them in her Cities, or her Fields; which the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire cannot do, without laying it self waste. And it goes in like manner with <HI>England, Germany,</HI> and many other Countreys. And for Power &amp; Force by Sea, all the other three parts of the World together, cannot match three only <HI>Europaean</HI> Nations.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences, Inventions</HI> and <HI>Improvements,</HI> she still carries it higher from all the rest; and they now have their Reign and Empire only in her Dominions, and that more glorious than ever. <HI>Asia,</HI> from whence they first came, must now call her Mistriss. And haughty <HI>China</HI> her self, submits now to be her Disciple. <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Old Rome</HI> too (where they were once confin'd) must now abate their Pride, and yeild to her the preheminence. For though there was a time when the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> counted all besides Barbarians, and rude, yet they could not do so now, should they appear with all their Bays and Laurels. And though <HI>China</HI> has presum'd her self hitherto the Eye of the World, yet she has of late been so dazled with the splendor of her Rays, that she is not ashamed to confess her self blind in comparison. The learned <HI>Jesuites</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
made them first see the disparity; for they were struck with such wonder and amazement at their appearance, as if they had never seen the Sun before, nor Learning ever arose in their Hemisphere; and could not sufficiently admire at their Science. We will produce here, to this end, their Story, out of <HI>Kir∣cher's China Illustrata,</HI> which is but of yesterday, and make it appear what Veneration they had for the <HI>Europaean</HI> Arts and Mysteries.</P>
<P><HI>Riccius</HI> the first Propagator of the Christian Religion, and <HI>Adams</HI> the last Instaurator and Finisher of the <HI>New China Ca∣lendar,</HI> not without the general applause and congratulation of the whole Empire, were had in such high esteem amongst them, and received such Honours and Favours, that hardly any History can parallel.</P>
<P><HI>Riccius,</HI> a learned Mathematician, did so allure the mind of the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> where he first landed, with Curiosi∣ties of Art and Science; that as neither He nor all <HI>China</HI> ever saw the like, so he received them like Angels descended from Heaven, rather than Inhabitants and Strangers of the Earth; and all the Learned amongst them strove for his acquaintance, and sent to him from all parts, desirous to behold the wonder∣ful things which he had brought with him, and to be acquain∣ted with his Arts: And though nothing but what is common, and obvious amongst us here, yet they seem'd a kind of Mira∣cles to them. Amongst other Things, was admired a <HI>Clock▪</HI> curiously contriv'd, which shew'd various distinctions of hours with the course of Sun and Moon. A Glass-<HI>Trigon,</HI> which some supposed an inestimable Gem, others a piece of the Heavenly Sphears. Geographick Maps, they wondring to see Worlds, and vast Empires and Kingdoms beyond their Walls; Ima∣gining that <HI>China</HI> was set in the midst of the Earth, like a large Gem in a Ring, and all the rest but as Gold to the Diamond; and a little troubled to find their spacious Empire, beyond which they thought there was none, confin'd to such a remote
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
corner of the East, and <HI>Europe</HI> divided into so many glorious Monarchies and Kingdoms, so far distant in the remote Re∣cesses of the West; and the whole Earth so surrounded by the main Ocean, and severed into so many Continents, Lands and Islands, and as it were New Worlds. In so much that <HI>Riccius</HI> seeing them a little displeased, was fain to describe the World in a larger form into two Hemisphears, so as <HI>China</HI> should stand in the midst: And therein afterwards illustrated all Countries and Parts in the <HI>China</HI> Character and Language; with which they were infinitely taken, and flock'd in multitudes to see, so that the House where it was could not contain them; And therefore at the Vice-Roys charge it was cut and printed, and Draughts thereof sent through all the Empire, which made all the Learned and Curious admire him, as another <HI>Atlas</HI> dropt down from the Stars, and most famous <HI>Astrologer</HI> of the whole World. And with these and the like Rarities and Cu∣riosities of Art, he became admirable throughout all the Em∣pire.</P>
<P><HI>Adams</HI> transcended him, and by reason of his incompara∣ble skill in the Mathematicks, and their own Language, be∣came yet more famous; And at last highly courted and car∣ressed by the new <HI>Tartarian</HI> Emperor himself▪ who made him one of his most intimate Familiars and Counsellors, and <HI>Man∣darine</HI> of the first Order, and assigned him the highest place in the <HI>Astronomical Tribunal,</HI> for emendation of the <HI>Calendar,</HI> com∣manding all <HI>Astronomers</HI> throughout his Empire to observe his Orders. He wondred at his infallible Prediction of Eclipses, at his expertness in casting Ordinance, and Counsel in State-Affairs. He honoured him as his Father, with highest love and affection, thinking something more than humane in him. And when few were admitted to his presence besides his Queens and Eunuchs; yet he had leave wher-ever he found the King, at home or abroad, to approach unto him; which was scarce granted to any else: called Him in their language, <HI>Venerable</HI>

<HI>Father;</HI> and four times in one year came to visit their House and Church. Would visit all the corners of their Colledge with him, and divert himself with him alone in his sorry Chamber, laying aside all State and Ceremony, fit for so great a Monarch; and observ'd towards him by all others; some∣times sitting upon his Straw-Bed, made like a Monks; some∣times upon an old Stool, to contemplate the Rarities of <HI>Europe;</HI> yea, was pleased also sometimes to taste of the domestick fruits of their Garden, with great satisfaction and pleasure; admired at their Altars and Pictures, their Splendour and Curiousness; at the Fairness and Elegancy of their Printed Books, the Let∣ter and the Cuts. But that which is more than all Comple∣ments, he commanded by his Royal Edict, to be engrav'd on an huge Marble-Stone, erected before the Doors of their Church, (which was also built through his favour, and finished <HI>Anno</HI> 1650.) his Royal Approbation of the Christian Religi∣on, partly in the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> and partly in the <HI>China</HI> Character and Language, which Charter to this very day is exposed to be seen in the Jesuites Gallery at <HI>Rome,</HI> as it was printed in <HI>China;</HI> (and is moreover drawn by an excellent hand in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Characters also, white, upon a black Fund or Bottom in the said Gallery likewise;) The tenour whereof, (that you may see the high esteem of this learned Jesuite, for his Art, and Skill and great Science) is as follows.</P>

<P>THe Heavenly Science <HI>Astronomy,</HI> which our Ancestours always made highest account of, deserves that We also should follow their steps, and extol it above the Skies; especially seeing the same was heretofore under divers Em∣perours wholly declined and decayed, and again restored, and chiefly in the time of the Empire of Juen, Emperour <HI>Tartarean,</HI> who govern'd the <HI>Chinois</HI> above 400 years since, was rendred more exact by Co ru kim, and finally at length did too much err in the last times of the fore-going Emperour Mim. There has been found one <HI>Johan∣nes Adamus Schall,</HI> coming from the utmost West into <HI>China,</HI> who was expert not onely in the Art of Calculation, but also in the <HI>Theory</HI> of the Pla∣nets, and whatsoever pertains unto Astronomy. He being brought before the Emperour our Pre∣decessor, by his Command undertook the care of the Acadamy of <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> and Restoration of <HI>Astronomy.</HI> But because many understood not the fruit that flows from this Science, it could not
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
then be concluded, that the Subjects should use that Science of his. But now when I came to the Empire, and my first care was, for the Order of Times, for the Good of the Realm, in the Au∣tumn of the very first year of my Reign, seeking an experiment of that Art, which <HI>John Adams</HI> had restor'd, I commanded to be observ'd most dili∣gently, the Eclipse of the Sun calculated by him sometime before; And it being found that, aswel the Moments of Time, as the Ecliptick Points, with all other Circumstances, did exactly answer his Calculation. And again, in the Spring of the following Year, when an Eclipse of the Moon offered it self, commanding the same to be ob∣served, with the same diligence, I also found that not to erre an hairs breadth neither; wherefore I presently apprehended that this Man was pre∣sented to us from Heaven at such a time as this, wherein I undertook the Government of so great an Empire, and thereupon committed the whole presidence of the <HI>Mathematick Tribunal</HI> to him only. But because <HI>John Adams</HI> from his Childhood is chast (and has led a single life) nor will meddle with any affairs not agreeing with his Religious∣way of life, I thought necessary, by absolute com∣mand, to oblige him to undertake this charge, and to add the dignity of the second Order, ac∣cording to the Title of <HI>Master of the Heavenly Area∣na's.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
In which office being now imployed some years, he adds daily more and more study and di∣ligence. And because he has a Temple near the Gate of the City, call'd Xun che Muen, where, according to the Rites of his Law, he offers Sa∣crifice to God; I also contributed some supply toward the building and adorning it: And when I entred that Temple, I perceived the Images and Utensils to have the appearance of extraneous and forreign things also. And concerning the Books of the Law, which I found placed on a Table, when I had ask'd what was contained in them? the said <HI>John Adams</HI> answered, That they contain'd an explication of the Divine Law. And truly I, seeing I had formerly apply'd my mind to the Doctrine Yao Xun Cheu, and Cum Cu, I perceived something out of their Books. In the Books Foe and I au, although I read some things, yet nothing sticks in my memory. But seeing I could not hitherto, by reason of the grand Affairs of the Kingdom, look into the Books of this Divine Law, but only by the by; I cannot give an exact judgment out of them, concerning that Law. But yet when I consider <HI>John Adams,</HI> who having liv'd for many years among the <HI>Chi∣nois,</HI> and with us, both observes and practises this Law, I judge it to be exceeding Good. For <HI>John Adams</HI> does so reverence his God, that he has de∣dicated
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
this Temple to him, conforming himself to this Law, with so great modesty and integri∣ty of his Person, for so many years, alwayes after the same manner and method; and not a jot va∣rying therefrom: This truly is an express sign, that 'tis a Law of the highest perfection, where∣in <HI>John Adams</HI> himself is seen to excel with such most approved vertue; seeing what that Law teaches, namely to serve God, obey Kings and Magistrates, to do evil to no man, to seek the Publick, and our Neighbour's good, he exactly fulfills with his fidelity. And would to God Ma∣gistrates, and all my Subjects, would imitate this his Industry and Diligence in serving God, and keeping the Divine Law, and would but come any thing near it, in obeying their Emperour; without doubt it would go far better by many degrees, and more prosperously with me, and the whole Kingdom. As for me, I mightily approve of, and commend this his mind, and this Law; And therefore in perpetual memory of this thing, I prefix before his Church, this Title, I um hiven hia Kim, That is, <HI>An excellent place to pe∣netrate Heaven.</HI> Given at Pekin, in the seventh year of Our Empire.</P>
<P>Whereby may be seen the Emperour's high esteem of this man, and consequently of the preheminence of the <HI>Europae∣ans</HI> Science and Art. For the Church it self it was built upon
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
the account of the restoring the <HI>China Calendar,</HI> as appears fur∣ther from the Inscription of the Church it self, by the <HI>Je∣suites.</HI></P>

<P>And moreover, he was so delighted with Globes &amp; Spheres, and Astronomick Instruments, sent for out of <HI>Europe</HI> that he would permit them no where but in the Closet of his own Chamber, and would be instructed in the use of them, by the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> whom he bore out against all the envy and opposition of the proud <HI>Chineses,</HI> who thought They should give the Laws of Arts and Sciences to all the World, and not receive them, from obscure <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and unknown Sons of the Earth, as they thought. Indeed 'tis pity the Christian Faith should be conveyed thither by no better hands; and that it should be so mix'd and marr'd with their Jesuitism, which yet they were so cunning as pritty well to hide and conceal; and like the Serpent, first to get in their head that afterwards they might winde and wriggle in their whole body: As appears by their Catechism, which we shall insert at the end of this Table, by way of Appendix, that you may have the sight thereof herewith; And because it is a very good one, for the most ignorant sort of people to apprehend; else how could they think to win others from Idolatry, that are such gross Idolaters themselves. Also great pitty 'tis that they that are so merciless and cruel to all other Religions, and Christi∣ans themselves at home, should finde such favour for their own abroad <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">For the Law of Nature is, <HI>Retaliation;</HI> and the Law of Arms and Nati∣ons is, <HI>Give and take Quarter.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>And if we compare latter times with former, we shall sind the Arts and Sciences never more flourishing; And though

many rare ones, it must be confessed, have been lost; yet a∣mends has been made for that, in more and better, and more universally useful, found out.

And wicked Mortals seem now to imitate the dread Thunderer and his Thunderbolts, by those terrible Instru∣ments of death and execution, which <HI>Liphus</HI> therefore calls the Invention of Spirits and not of Men: and yet they sooner put an end to fight, and perfect victory, than all the lingring tools of death among the Ancients. The <HI>Turks</HI> imployed a Peece of Ordnance against <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that required seventy yoke of Oxen and two thousand Men to hale it along. The Circula∣tion of the Bloud is such an invention, for which the Ancients would certainly have deified the Author, no less than <HI>Ceres▪</HI> or <HI>Bachus, Aesculapius</HI> and <HI>Apollo.</HI> The Universal Character and Language, almost equals that of Letters, in the Invention, as it is far beyond it in the Thing.</P>

<P>The business of Experiments, <HI>i. e.</HI> Their Study and Practice was never so far prosecuted and advanced by the Antients, as in our dayes. Nor did they ever conspire into such universal and comprehensive Societies and Assemblies of Men, of all Qualities and Conditions, for all possible advancement of Learning, both in recovering the lost Arts, perfecting the old, and finding out of all manner of new; which alone is that, which above all things else, lifts up <HI>Europe</HI> at this pre∣sent above all the World, and all preceding Ages. Was it ever known before, that Gentlemen, Nobles, Kings and Princes did combine into such Glorious Assemblies? Or when did they ever turn Philosophers, Experimenters, and Opera∣tors; and as I may say, <HI>Mechanicks,</HI> before? The Academies of <HI>Italy,</HI> those of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and above all the Royal Society of <HI>England,</HI> are beyond all president of other times.</P>
<P>We might instance further in her <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Commerce,</HI> her Shipping and Navigation, and shew how she exceeds all the
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
rest in these advantages; insomuch, that for one <HI>Egyptian</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> that comes into <HI>Europe,</HI> there passes into <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> an hundred <HI>English,</HI> an hundred <HI>French,</HI> an hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> an hundred <HI>Italians,</HI> an hundred <HI>Germains,</HI> and an hundred <HI>Dutch;</HI> and an hundred times more for one <HI>Ame∣rican.</HI> The <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> and the <HI>Carthagintans;</HI> the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> and the <HI>Sidonians,</HI> were renowned of old for great Naviga∣tors and Merchants, yet they only Coasted it about the Inland and Midland Seas, but durst never venture to cross the main Ocean. Into what a narrow compass then was their Know∣ledge and Commerce confin'd. The Antients ingrav'd <HI>Non ultra,</HI> upon <HI>Hercules</HI>'s Pillars, at the Mouth of the <HI>Streights,</HI> and a greater part than all the other three of the known World besides, was wholly <HI>Terra Incognita</HI> to them. They were beholden to the Lights of Heaven for a Guide in a dark night, and to grope by Star-light, were lost in a Mist, and feign to ply it up and down the Shores only; whereas now they are able to cross it from the North Pole to the South Pole, from the Rising to the Setting of the Sun, from <HI>Nova Zemblia,</HI> to <HI>Magellanica,</HI> and from <HI>India</HI> beyond <HI>Ganges,</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>Western Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The prodigious advance of Shipping of our dayes, is emi∣nently seen in the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who are said to build a thousand Vessels every year fit for Navigation and Commerce, whereof the least, for matter and making, besides Tackling, stands them in no less than two thousand Crowns. And many times, as <HI>Pontanus</HI> affirm'd long since, arrive at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> as many Ships in a day, as there are dayes in the year. The <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> come not much behind, and many other Nati∣ons in their proportion. The Fleets that enter the <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Texel,</HI> the <HI>Guadelquivir</HI> (at <HI>Sevil)</HI> and the <HI>Tage,</HI> (at <HI>Lisbone)</HI> the <HI>Seine,</HI> and the <HI>Lloir,</HI> (in <HI>France)</HI> are ample testi∣monies of her abundance and preheminence. It must not be denied, That <HI>Europe</HI> receives more from other parts of the
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
World, than she repales. But in this very thing it is, That her Commerce becomes glorious to her, since she knows how to make it so to her advantage. She parts with a little of her Brandies (or <HI>Aqua Vitaes)</HI> and Draperies; or at best a little Coral and Amber; But she has not Magazines enough to hold all her precious stores that come to her from the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> from <HI>Barbary</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> from <HI>New France</HI> and <HI>New Spain,</HI> from <HI>Brasil</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> besides what is done within her self, and her own bounds.</P>

<P>It would trouble Arithmetick many times to find Numbers to answer the quantity of pounds of Sugar, of Peppers, of Cinamons, of Cloves, of Mace, of Nutmegs, and all other Riches from abroad. To say nothing of Pearls and Precious Stones, of Silks, nor of Cottons, of Bezoart, nor of Indigo, of Gumlac, nor of Purslanes, of Salt-Peter, nor Salt-Amoni∣ak. And to set aside Drugs and Medicaments, Tobaco, and Castors, and abundance of Mullet, one of the most excellent
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
Fish of the Ocean, which alone makes the Riches of five or six good Cities. In a word, all the Riches of the Earth, and all the delights of the Sea. So that though every Land do not bear all things, yet they need want none; and may so change Commodities, as if they had changed Countries one to the other.</P>
<P>And yet though Diamonds, Pearls, and Spices, are onely fetch'd from the <HI>Indies;</HI> yet some return is made for them in Coral and Amber, which <HI>Europe</HI> exchanges, for the Jewels of <HI>Asia.</HI> The <HI>Japons,</HI> all their Passion is for Coral, as much as ours for Diamonds and Pearls. Insomuch that a Grain of the bigness of an ordinary Egg, is there worth 2000 Crowns. And in the North of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Cathy,</HI> much is vended; where all the people wear Bracelets thereof, about their Necks, Arms, and Legs, and make it their principal Ornament. And use the greatest Grains thereof for their richest Purses, which they wear by their sides. And for Yellow Amber, a great quanti∣ty is consumed in <HI>China,</HI> for when a person of quality will make a splendid Treatment; at the end of the Feast they bring three or four Censours, wherein they sprinkle Aber, some∣times to the value of a thousand Crowns; being the more they burn, the more it is for his glory that Treats; and is much used in Fumes, upon all other occasions, the smell thereof being agreeable to them, and the flame having something which other flames have not. Hence Amber is one of the best Merchandises that <HI>Europe</HI> can send into <HI>Asia,</HI> and the <HI>Holland</HI> Company reserve it particularly to themselves, to sell it dear at <HI>Batavia</HI> to the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Europe</HI> then at present carries it so high both for Arts and Arms, for Riches and Commerce, (the main Props of States and Kingdoms) and all things else comprehended in them; And if she now enjoyes all these advantages, before all other parts &amp; more than ever heretofore; She has yet that which car∣ries her still higher, and whereof to glory further, (as the high∣est
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
prerogative of humane kind.) That She is no longer <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> but <HI>Christendom.</HI> I say <HI>Christendom,</HI> and that she has im∣brac'd the true Religion, and rejected Idolatry, and the false Worship of the <HI>Pagans.</HI> And though a new <HI>Romish</HI> and <HI>Pa∣pal</HI> Superstition and Idolatry overspread one half and more of her Dominions, and with grief it is to be confessed, that it is every where also yet but a lamentable Christianity, and an <HI>Hea∣then</HI>- (a Pagan, Unchristian, and very Antichristian) -<HI>Christen∣dom,</HI> or <HI>Christian-Heathendom;</HI> rather where Heathenish Warrs and Fightings, Heathenish Rites and Customs, and Heathen∣ish Superstitions; where Heathenish Sects and contendings about needless Ceremonies and Opinions, Heathenish Zeal and Fury against pure Religion, and undefiled; (like that of the Heathen against <HI>Socrates,</HI> for owning the true God) and Heathenish Vices and Crimes reign and rage throughout; yet the true God is outwardly worshipped and owned; The Doctrine, or rather Mystery of a <HI>Crucified</HI> Christ, but alone truly <HI>deified and adorable Man,</HI> (above all the <HI>Hero's,</HI> and <HI>Gods,</HI> and <HI>Saints,</HI> and <HI>Divine-like Persons</HI> of the <HI>Pagans,</HI> or <HI>Prophets</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Mahometans; The Man Jesus,</HI> true God and Man, (O the <HI>Mystery</HI> of Godliness, God manifest in the flesh! &amp;c. hid in times past to the Gentiles, &amp;c. but now revealed to the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> more than ever, and more than to all other parts of the World) I say, the Mystery of a Crucified Christ, but true <HI>deified Person,</HI> the <HI>Man Jesus,</HI> the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the World, is openly professed by all, and seriously believed in by thousands, (O adorable <HI>Jesu!</HI> who would not read thy Story, and study thy Acts, and Heroick Deeds and Vir∣tues, and imitate thy life, and believe and obey in thy King∣dom?) an infinity of Souls are gain'd to him, an infinity of Victories got over the <HI>Devil,</HI> and an infinite of Trophies erected upon the ruines of <HI>Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed the grievous and shameful Schisms and Vices, the lamentable Dissentions and Divisions of Christians, and
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
Christian Princes, so prodigally throwing away so many thou∣sand mens Christians Lives, nay and Souls, in unchristian-Christian Quarrels, is the reproachful blur to all her Puissance and Splendor; and which will never cease, nor the Christian Religion ever flourish and prosper in the World, as it ought, and Kings be her Nursing Fathers, and Queens her Nursing Mothers, till they be more sunk and baptized into the <HI>thing,</HI> than the name <HI>Christianity,</HI> and answer throughly their Mag∣nificent and Specious Titles of Mass Catholick, most Christi∣an, &amp;c. Majesties. And when once the <HI>Turks</HI> Fingers, all four, shall grow together; Then, alack! and not before, we may hope to see our Masters agree and co-unite.</P>
<Q><L>Still Christian Wars, they will pursue and boast,</L>
<L>Unjust Successes gain'd, whilst <HI>Candy</HI>'s lost.</L></Q>
<P>Which may now e'ne just take up <HI>Rhodes</HI> Complaint against them all.</P>
<Q><L>All gaining vainly from each others loss,</L>
<L>Whilst still the <HI>Crescent</HI> drives away the <HI>Cross.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Cross</HI> which they ought to take for their <HI>Device</HI> or <HI>Mot∣to,</HI> which is believ'd to have been given <HI>from Heaven,</HI> to <HI>Christendoms</HI> first <HI>Emperor,</HI> in this overcome. But 'tis hop'd that the two <HI>generous</HI> Nations of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> which are able to do much when they are entirely united, will keep their Union firm, for some nobler Enterprise worthy of them∣selves, and the high Reputation they have gain'd in the World.</P>
<P>But that which more than all Eclipses and stirs her present Splendor, and robs her of her Crown and Glory of Religi∣on, and hinders the progress and flourishing thereof in the Earth, are the cruel and bloody Inquisitions and Persecutions
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
for Religion and Conscience, of her several Sects and parties within her self, which are more merciless to one another than they would, or ought to be to <HI>Pagans, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Infidels;</HI> or <HI>Turks, Pagans,</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> would be, or are to them; and give less liberty of Religion amongst themselves, then they may find there amongst <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>Which plainly shews that there lacks only common Candor and Ingenuity, and but tolerable civility of men, (much more of Christians) not to talk of prudence, to introduce a reaso∣nable Liberty of Conscience; and but that aequanimity and largeness of heart for Religion (as is for other matters) amongst different perswasions; and that only due liberty and freedom thereof, that is the common right of mankind; even if it were but that, they would give to one another, which they would have, and may and do receive, among Idolaters, Hea∣thens, and Mahometans, (for the Christians have their Churches and Temples in <HI>Turky,</HI> and even <HI>China</HI> it self, though they have none permitted here neither) I say, there lacks onely this <HI>rea∣sonable liberty and largeness of Christian Religion,</HI> to make <HI>Chri∣stendom</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> happy.</P>
<P>So then <HI>Europe</HI> is at this day the most noble and fairest part of the Grand Continent for Religion, Learning, Civility and Policy; for the Arts and the Arms, and all that is Gallant, and Polite, or Handsome, and deserves to be stil'd, The Temple of Religion, the Court of Policy and Government, the Aca∣demy of Civility and good Manners, the Mistress of Arts and of Arms, of Shipping and Navigation, and indeed the Para∣dice of all humane Felicities in comparison.</P>
<P>For so it is, that all things have their Revolutions and Peri∣ods, (both in regard of Times and of Places, from one place to another, in one Age, and then in another) and that the peo∣ple which now live between the <HI>Euxine Streights,</HI> and the <HI>At∣lantick Ocean,</HI> eclipse all the Sparkling and Pomp of Ancient <HI>Persia</HI> her self.

<P><HI>EUrope</HI> (as hath been enough seen) being the most accom∣plished and considerable, though the least part of the Earth; and at this day more then ever heretofore, deserves chiefly, and in the first place, to be taken notice of by us, as she appears at present.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="17"/>
To which end we shall first draw a <HI>general Table</HI> of the <HI>whole,</HI> and then <HI>particular Tables</HI> of each <HI>part;</HI> In both delineating only bare and naked <HI>Draughts,</HI> as it were▪ of the present Go∣vernments, Languages, Religions, Riches, Forces, and Com∣merce, Revolutions, Pretentions and Interest, &amp;c. of <HI>Europe;</HI> with other memorable &amp; observable Things, and Occurrences, as they fall in our way; first in <HI>General,</HI> and then in <HI>Particular,</HI> in the distinct description of each Region and Country thereof.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>GOVERNMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>We begin therefore this second Part <HI>General,</HI> with the <HI>Ge∣neral Governments of</HI> Europe, intending onely <HI>General</HI> Heads of Things in this <HI>General Table.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Government</HI> is considered either as Civil or Ecclesiastick. <HI>The Civil Government of</HI> Europe <HI>in general,</HI> is either purely Monarchick, of a single Sovereign, or Aristocratick of the Nobles and Senators, or after a sort Democratick, and Popu∣lar, of the People, commonly call'd, <HI>Common Wealth,</HI> (for there's scarce any that is purely so, except you will reckon some few among the Petty <HI>Cantons</HI> of the <HI>Suisses,</HI> which make but a little member of that great Body) or mixt of these. But more particularly, whether one or the other.</P>
<P><HI>The Principal Crowns, and States Sovereign of</HI> EUROPE, (for they are not all worthy of the high Title of Monarchies) may be reduc'd to Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, Dutchies, and Re∣publicks, or Common-Wealths; together with the Papality and State of the Pope, as a Temporal Prince in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the County of <HI>Venaissy,</HI> which makes a Sovereignty apart.</P>
<P>After which rate <HI>Europe</HI> has two Empires, seven Kingdoms, seven Electorships, and of late years, an eight; seven grand
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>
Dutchies, seven Republicks or Common-Wealths, three grand Principalities, (which are now all tributary to the grand Segnior) and a Papality.</P>
<P>The two Empires, are the Empire of <HI>Germany,</HI> half Mo∣narchy, half Common-Wealth, the Emperor not being abso∣lute, but onely in the Lands whereof he is Lord and owner. And the Empire of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who are subject to one onely Monarch. Some add the Empire of <HI>Russia</HI> for a third.</P>
<P>The seven Kingdoms, are the Kingdom of <HI>France, Spain, Portugal, England, Denmark, Sweedland,</HI> and <HI>Poland.</HI> The first, the most perfect, and descends only to the Heirs Male, ever since the <HI>Salique</HI> Law. The five next admit the Females; and all are haereditary save the last, which is Elective. But though all these Estates be purely Monarchick, yet the three latter (besides <HI>Poland)</HI> are not absolute Monarchies, nor leave their Kings so much elbow-room, nor their Commands so absolute and Sovereign as the other.</P>
<P>There are moreover in <HI>Europe</HI> other lesser Kingdoms com∣prehended under these; as those of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> under the Emperor. That of <HI>Navarre,</HI> under the Crown of <HI>France.</HI> Those of <HI>Naples, Sicily, Sardinia,</HI> and <HI>Maiorck,</HI> under the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And those of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> under the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Seven Electors, three Eccleasiastick, four Saecular, and of late a fifth, are the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> Dean of the Colledge of Electors, Lord High-Chancellor of the Em∣pire in <HI>Germany.</HI> The Arch-Bishop of <HI>Colen,</HI> Lord High-Chancellor of the Empire in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Arch-Bishop of <HI>Tre∣vers,</HI> Lord High-Chancellor of the Empire in <HI>France.</HI> The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> at this time Emperor, (till the young King his Son come to be installed therein) chief Cup-bearer of the Empire. Count <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> heretofore the fifth Elector, chief Almoner of the Houshold; now the eighth, and Lord High-Treasurer, since the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> new∣created
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>
was put in his place; The Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> Lord High-Marshal, (or Sword-Bearer); and the Marquess of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> Lord High-Chamberlain, and who has the largest Territories next the Emperor himself.</P>
<P>These Electors are Sovereign in their Estates, and though Members of the Empire, yet can make Peace and War when they please, whereof we have at this present a sad example be∣tween the Elector Palatine, and the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> with the <HI>Lorrainers.</HI></P>
<P>The Ecclesiastick Electors ever had the precedency of the other, by reason of the height and Supremacy of the Pope in Temporals, and the Saecular Power of the Bishops in former times.</P>
<P>The seven Grand Dutchies or Dukedoms which have each their particular Lords and Masters, are the Dukedom of <HI>Mos∣covy,</HI> (the Prince whereof assumes the Title of Emperor, and by some is reckoned among Empires; As indeed to say the truth, it is a Dukedom on which depends thirty other Dutchies, and three Kingdoms, which exceed <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> in extent, and notwithstanding all their Cold, are fill'd with In∣habitants. And the Duke himself is absolute over his Sub∣jects.) The Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> at this day, the first in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> whose Dukes are Electors, and the Dutchy of <HI>Holstein.</HI> As for the great Duke of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> he is subject to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Dutchy of <HI>Milan</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And the other petty Dutchies of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> are not of any force or reckoning with these seven.</P>
<P>We must crown all these Dutchies or Dukedoms, with the one only Arch-Dukedom of <HI>Austria,</HI> whereof the Emperor is Master; and add that all these Estates have nothing mixt in the form of their Government, and that they acquiess under the Authority of one alone.</P>
<P>The seven Common-Wealths, are those of the <HI>Suisses,</HI> of
<PB N="31" REF="18"/>
<HI>Venice,</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> of <HI>Lucca,</HI> of <HI>Gene∣va,</HI> and of <HI>Raguza.</HI> For the petty Common-Wealth of St. <HI>Marine,</HI> must not come into this Range.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Hans</HI>-Towns, and free Cities of <HI>Germany,</HI> they acknowledge some subjection or other to the Empire, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The three grand Principalities are, <HI>Transilvania, Wallachia,</HI> and <HI>Moldavia,</HI> all three tributary to the <HI>Turk.</HI> As for the Prince of <HI>Precopia,</HI> or lesser <HI>Tartary,</HI> called the <HI>Crim Tartar,</HI> he is now made slave to the <HI>Turk,</HI> and over him a Beglerbeg, or Bassa, to command in chief.</P>
<P>It will not, perhaps, distast the Reader to give a List here of the present Kings and Princes, according to their different Ages together.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain, Swedeland,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the Land-grave of <HI>Hesse-Cassel,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> are yet in their Minority.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France, England, Portugal,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Ba∣varia,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Duke Regent of <HI>Holstein,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI> the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse-darmstat,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Mickleburgh,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Mount-Belliard,</HI> the Prince of <HI>East-Friezland,</HI> the Marquess of <HI>Bada,</HI> the grand Duke of <HI>Moscovy,</HI> and the grand Segnior; All these Princes are in the prime of their Age, and like to reign long.</P>
<P>Those that have passed the middle of their dayes, and begin to draw towards their evening, are the Pope, (alwayes) the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who has now lately resign'd his Crown, and none other yet chose; the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the three Elec∣tors Ecclesiastick, three of the Secular, the Palatine, the Elec∣tor of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and of <HI>Brandenburgh;</HI> the three Princes of <HI>Transilvania, Walachia,</HI> and <HI>Moldavia.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain, Wittenburgh, Newburgh, Brunswick, Wolfen-Buttel,</HI> the great Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Parma.</HI></P>
<P>The Ecclesiastick Government of <HI>Europe,</HI> in general, is either Papal, owning the Pope as Supream; or Episcopal,
<PB N="32" REF="19"/>
owning the King as Supream, in all causes; and Arch-Bishops and Bishops under him; call'd also <HI>Prelatical,</HI> (as in the Church of <HI>England)</HI> or <HI>Super-intendent,</HI> which is a kind of <HI>Episcopal</HI> among the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> but yet owning no Head of the Church, neither Pope, nor King, or Civil Magistrate, to order the Af∣fairs of the Church, as such. The <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> or <HI>Synodical,</HI> owning a Presbytery, or Synod, as Supream, and Lay-Elders, &amp;c. but no Bishops, nor Super-intendents, as in <HI>France, Hol∣land,</HI> &amp;c. As for other forms of Government, there are none established any where by publick Authority. And this is the present face almost of <HI>Europe</HI> in General.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>The present Languages of <HI>Europe,</HI> for we pass by those that are out of date, as the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, which are rather Scholastical, than National, and onely us'd among the Learned, may be reduced to three, the <HI>Teutonick,</HI> the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> and the derivatives of Latin and Greek corrupted. By the way only take notice, that the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue is the same in <HI>Asia,</HI> that the Latin is in <HI>Europe,</HI> and that by its help, one may march from the <HI>Bosphorus</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> to the furthermost Lands of the Indians. We find not therefore in <HI>Europe</HI> more then two Mother Tongues at present, which have each their several Dialects, with some sprouts, as it were, of the two dead Languages, Latin and Greek.</P>
<P>The two Mother Languages then, are the <HI>Teutonick,</HI> and the <HI>Sclavonian:</HI> The <HI>Sclavonian</HI> is familiar at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and even at <HI>Grand Caire;</HI> And has for its principal Dialects, the <HI>Rheuthenick,</HI> or <HI>Russian,</HI> for the <HI>Moscovites;</HI> the <HI>Dalmattan</HI> for the <HI>Transilvanians,</HI> and <HI>Hungarians;</HI> the <HI>Bohemian,</HI> and the <HI>Polonian;</HI> the <HI>Illyrian, Jazigian,</HI> &amp;c. with some others which have their course amongst the <HI>Walachians,</HI> and the <HI>Moldavians,</HI> and the lesser <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="19"/>
The <HI>Teutonick</HI> hath three principal Dialects, the <HI>German,</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and the <HI>Danish.</HI> And of these again issue forth other Idioms, as the <HI>Flemish,</HI> or <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> the <HI>English,</HI> the <HI>Swedish,</HI> the <HI>Cauchian</HI> of the <HI>East-Friezlanders,</HI> (amongst them∣selves only, for they use <HI>Dutch</HI> to strangers) the Language of <HI>Norway,</HI> and of the <HI>Suissers.</HI></P>
<P>The Greek Language, <HI>Mort,</HI> or dead, but less corrupted than the <HI>Latin,</HI> hath divers Reliques, and shootings forth in divers Isles of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> in <HI>Achaia,</HI> and <HI>Morea,</HI> under the great <HI>Turk,</HI> and is better preserv'd here in these named, then in any other Province of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>The States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> did some years since contribute liberally to the charge of an Impression of the New Testament in Vulgar Greek, whereto there has been joyn'd the Ancient or Original Greek, for the consolation of those poor people that groan under the Tyranny of the <HI>Otto∣mans.</HI></P>
<P>The Latin, the other Tongue <HI>Mort,</HI> has but three principal shoots or branches, the <HI>Italian, French,</HI> and <HI>Spanish.</HI> But this last has an huge medly of barbarous tearms left from the <HI>Moors.</HI> And under these three are to be comprehended the <HI>Savoyan</HI> and <HI>Piemontian,</HI> those of <HI>Sicily, Sardinia,</HI> and of the <HI>Grisons</HI> in the <HI>Alps.</HI></P>
<P>We might find out yet seven other Tongues in <HI>Europe,</HI> but of far less extent then the preceding, and not nois'd of in the World; As the <HI>Albanian,</HI> (or <HI>Epirotick)</HI> in <HI>Epirus,</HI> and <HI>Ma∣cedonia;</HI> The <HI>Bulgarian</HI> for <HI>Servia, Bosnia</HI> and <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> under the <HI>Turks.</HI> The <HI>Cossack</HI> or <HI>Tartarian</HI> of the lesser <HI>Tartary,</HI> in the <HI>Taurica Chersonesus,</HI> and all along the River <HI>Tanais.</HI> The <HI>Finnick,</HI> in <HI>Finland,</HI> and <HI>Lapland,</HI> Provinces of <HI>Swedeland.</HI> That of the Wilde-<HI>Irish</HI> and <HI>Scotch,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the West of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The <HI>British,</HI> or <HI>Welch,</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and some parts of <HI>Cornwal</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and half through <HI>Bretain Armorica,</HI> or <HI>Little Britain,</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> And lastly, the <HI>Biscayan,</HI> on this side,
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>
and that side the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills, and near to the <HI>Cantabrian</HI> Ocean, as little understood to the rest of the World, as the old <HI>British</HI> it self. Besides some <HI>Arabick,</HI> not worth mentioning in the Mountains of <HI>Granada,</HI> call'd <HI>Alpuxarras</HI> ever since the <HI>Moors</HI> possess'd those parts.</P>
<P>Of all these Languages there are some <HI>Masculine,</HI> but some∣thing rude and harsh, as the <HI>German,</HI> and in some sort the <HI>Spa∣nish,</HI> through the Reliques and mixture of the <HI>Moorish;</HI> And some <HI>Faeminine,</HI> but more delicate and fine, as the <HI>Italian,</HI> and in some sort the <HI>English, Which are more graceful in the mouths of the Women, (and become them best) than the Mens, who cannot use too much gravity in their Speech.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moreover the Language of the</HI> Spaniards <HI>is said to be Manly, the</HI> Italian, <HI>Courtly; and the</HI> French, <HI>Amorous; The</HI> German <HI>is like their Nation, Warlike.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> is now become a compleat mixture of all, <HI>viz.</HI> old <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>Saxon, Latine,</HI> and chiefly <HI>French,</HI> with some sprinklings of <HI>Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Ita∣lian;</HI> flourishing now at length with a rare choice out of all; occasioned by the constant travels and education of our <HI>English</HI> Gentry and Nobility (and Scholars with them) abroad.</P>
<P>By reason of all which diversities of Tongues, there has been not only Designs, but real Endeavours and Essayes, and of late more than ever, towards <HI>an Universal Character and Lan∣guage,</HI> to avoid the confusion of these. And of all, the Uni∣versally Learned <HI>Wilkins</HI> excels; and has wonderfully out∣done all the <HI>Ingenioso's, Virtuoso's,</HI> or <HI>Literado's</HI> of the World, that have gone about it, or medled therewith. And it no longer lies now on the Inventors, but the Learners (no less than the whole <HI>Worlds)</HI> part, who are hardly taught all <HI>one thing,</HI> to make it familiar and easie, that is, <HI>Universal.</HI></P>

<HEAD>RELIGIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Three Religions do at this day divide all the Earth, <HI>Heathen, Mahometan,</HI> and <HI>Christian.</HI> The first is, without doubt, the largest; the second, in like manner, carries it from the third, and best; but with this difference, that this last is more con∣centred together, and fills the most peopled Provinces of the Universe.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Jews,</HI> they are no Nation, but dispersed in all, have no fixt Seat, Principalities, nor Magistrates. Yet their number is great, both in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> and all the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions; besides some sprinklings in <HI>Italy, Holland,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Paganism,</HI> or <HI>Heathenism,</HI> embraces more than three quar∣ters of both the <HI>America's,</HI> and more then two thirds, even of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> also. All that prodigious space of Ground of the <HI>America's,</HI> greater than all the other three parts of the World besides put together, is fill'd with Idolaters, who wor∣ship Animals, Vegetables, Stars, and Devils. And com∣prehends innumerable vast Regions, (populous) Nations, and mighty Kingdoms. And in <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> in like manner, a fearful company of Nations, Kindreds and People live in thick darkness of <HI>Paganism</HI> and Ignorance of the true God.</P>
<P><HI>Mahometism</HI> never yet had footing in <HI>America;</HI> But in <HI>A∣frick,</HI> the mighty Kingdoms of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> the Juris∣dictions of <HI>Tremisen, Algiers, Tunis, Tripolis,</HI> of <HI>Barce,</HI> and <HI>Egypt.</HI> In <HI>Asia,</HI> the Grand Seignor, the Kings and Princes of the three <HI>Arabia's,</HI> the Grand <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> the Grand <HI>Mogul,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Visapor,</HI> and <HI>Colconda.</HI> The Kings on both the sides of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and of <HI>Malavar.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>Maldives.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Achem,</HI> and all the Princes of the Grand Isle of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> The Emperor of <HI>Java;</HI> The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Bantam;</HI> and other Princes of the Neighbouring
<PB N="36" REF="21"/>
Isles; For their people are generally Idolaters. Which we ought no more to wonder at, than at the medly that is found in like manner among Christians themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Christianism</HI> makes two Grand Branches, the Trunk or Body whereof is in <HI>Europe,</HI> but the Branches extend themselves far and near into all the parts of the Universe, both <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> And they are the Eastern Christians, (or the Eastern and Greek Church) the Roman Christians, or Papists, (the corrupt Church) and the Protestant Christians, (or Reformed Church) both members of the Latin, (or We∣stern Church) in opposition to the Greek, or Eastern. The Greek Church differs chiefly from the Latin, about the Pro∣fession of the Holy Ghost, and some other Points and Arti∣cles of Faith. The Protestant from the Papistical, chiefly a∣bout the Popes Supremacy and Infallability, Sacrament of the Altar, and Indulgences, which gave the first occasion, and other corrupt Points and Doctrines, stablish'd since by the <HI>Council of Trent.</HI> The Romans call themselves the <HI>Catholick Apostolical Church,</HI> but most unjustly, and all the rest Hereticks: and the Protestants reckon themselves the onely true <HI>Catholick Apostolick,</HI> and call the others the <HI>Antichristian, Babylonish,</HI> or false, and themselves the <HI>Reformed Church;</HI> which indeed is true, so far as they are truly reformed. But yet 'tis much to be fear'd, and shrewdly to be suspected, that Antichrist reaches further than <HI>Rome,</HI> and that all <HI>Rome,</HI> 'tis to be hoped, is not <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P>The Christians of the East make up a great number, and possess large Countries; the Christians Roman, and the Chri∣stians Protestant, may dispute for Number and Power, and make comparison. We make none here, but only of the Pro∣vinces which they possess, without going beyond our mark, intending only a bare Relation, or plain Table, and no Zeal of Comparisons.</P>
<P>In the Eastern Church are also many differences crept in; but
<PB N="37" REF="21"/>
the Greeks bear the chief sway, although both the <HI>Armenia's,</HI> who make a company apart, are a considerable Body. We put all together here, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the <HI>Abyssins,</HI> the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> the <HI>Nestorians,</HI> the <HI>Cophites,</HI> the <HI>Maronites,</HI> the <HI>Georgians,</HI> the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and the <HI>Melchites,</HI> or <HI>Assyrians.</HI> In the Reformed Church of the Protestants, are the two great Sects of the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> which we put both together, as <HI>Protestants</HI> united against the <HI>Romanists,</HI> and now also labouring hard on both sides to unite among themselves, though the latter only took the Title of <HI>Reformed.</HI></P>
<P>As we blame the pride and haughtiness of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who before that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had humbled them, believed that all the rest of the Universe, beyond their Mountains and Walls that encompass them, was wholly desolate or barbarous. In like manner ought we not to suffer an infinity of Ignorants, who because, perhaps in <HI>Colen,</HI> they see but an hundred <HI>Prote∣stants,</HI> or so, presently imagine the same of all <HI>Germany,</HI> and of the whole World, and reckon their Church <HI>Catholick,</HI> when 'tis but a moity of the least part of the Earth; and not esteem∣ing things but by their outward splendor and glittering, pass unjustly from the unequal esteem, and false count of their number, to the unequal esteem, or false count of their Virtue and Cause. Besides the advantage of Number is no great ad∣vantage. The <HI>Mahometans</HI> on this account carry it from the Christians; and the very Heathens from both. So that nei∣ther the one or the other have any great reason to glory. The only glorying is to have God on their side. But let us come to the Countries which each possess.</P>
<P><HI>Europe,</HI> as was said, is almost all Christendom. Yet Ido∣laters and Heathen are still found in the cold Region of the <HI>Laplanders;</HI> and although they are distinguished into <HI>Danes, Swedes,</HI> and <HI>Moscovites,</HI> yet they hardly obey, either the Duke <HI>Moscovy,</HI> or the King of <HI>Suede,</HI> or of <HI>Denmark▪ Mahometa∣nism</HI> is more spread, but not beyond the <HI>Turks</HI> Territories:
<PB N="38" REF="22"/>
It is follow'd at <HI>Constantinople</HI> in <HI>Romania,</HI> and in the places of <HI>Dalmatia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> where he is Master. It has its course, also in the <HI>Taurick Chersonese,</HI> and the lesser <HI>Tartary.</HI> But all these Countries together, make not above one tenth part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Judaism</HI> onely lurks in little corners and holes of Christendom, and dares hardly shew its face but with some kind of disgrace and infamy; Witness their yellow Hats in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Avignon,</HI> for a mark of dishonour. Yet the Jews have their Synagogues, and their principal ones are at <HI>Amster∣dam, Avignon, Rome, Venice,</HI> and divers other places of <HI>Hol∣land</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> They are found moreover at <HI>Franck-fort, Hamburgh,</HI> and other Cities of <HI>Germany,</HI> and some at <HI>London</HI> also through connivance, though the Laws be against them. But they are least troubled in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and there, as well for their Number, as for their Priviledges, through the force of Silver Weapons, they make something a greater noise than elsewhere. <HI>Greece</HI> is yet fuller, they have free Trade at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and <HI>Grand Caire;</HI> They manage principal Af∣fairs; they have places of Profit and Revenues, and generally they are powerful through all the <HI>Ottomans</HI> Empire. For Christians, according to the three Branches of Christianism mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> the Christians of the East, the Christians Roman, and the Christians Protestant, they take up all the rest.</P>
<P>The Christians of the East, or the Eastern Church, advan∣tagiously divide with the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and the <HI>Jews,</HI> all <HI>Greece,</HI> and all the Neighbouring Isles of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> And in Mount <HI>Athos</HI> alone, for which cause they have since given it the name of <HI>Monte Sancto,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Mountain;</HI> one may see twenty four Monasteries of <HI>Caloyers,</HI> or certain Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> (of which Order generally the Greek Church are) to the number of six thousand.</P>
<P>And under this Branch comprehending all the several Sects
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>
that use different Liturgies, the Eastern Church is extended yet further into <HI>Russia,</HI> who are all thereof; and out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> in <HI>Africa;</HI> into <HI>Georgia, Armenia, Assyria,</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> and if one would, even to <HI>India</HI> it self, and to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Tenduc,</HI> on the North of <HI>Cathay,</HI> where <HI>Mark Polo</HI> found some Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the A∣postle.</P>
<P>Each of these Sects has their Patriarchs, and these Patri∣archs, like as the Bishops also, are all Monks of one of the two Orders of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> or St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> his follower.</P>
<P>For the other Religions, the Roman Religion is absolute Mistress in <HI>Spain, Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> The Religion Prote∣stant in the Islands of Great <HI>Britane,</HI> in <HI>Swedeland</HI> and <HI>Den∣mark.</HI></P>
<P>The Roman Religion bears the sway intirely in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Provinces of the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> the Protestants in the <HI>United Provinces.</HI></P>
<P>The Roman Religion reigns solely in the petty <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland;</HI> the Protestant in the great <HI>Cantons.</HI></P>
<P>The Roman Religion has the upper hand intirely in the Countries of the three Electors Ecclesiastick, of <HI>Mayence, Trevers</HI> and <HI>Colen.</HI> The Protestant in the Countries of three of the Electors Saecular, the Palatinate of the <HI>Rhine, Saxony,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Roman Religion has not any mixture apparent in the Haeredetary Countries of the Emperor, <HI>Austria, Bohemia, Mo∣ravia, Tirol, Carinthia, Stiria,</HI> and <HI>Carniola,</HI> nor in the Elec∣tors the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>The Protestant has little or none at all, in <HI>Suavia, Silesia,</HI> both the <HI>Prussi's, Pomerania, Hisse,</HI> the Archbishoprick of <HI>Breme,</HI> and in the Dukedoms of <HI>Holstein, Lunenburgh, Meckle∣burgh.</HI> But in the other Provinces of <HI>Germany,</HI> as in the Dutchies of <HI>Cleveland, Juliers, Alsatia, Westphalia,</HI> and <HI>Fran∣conia,</HI> the two Religions are almost equally divided, except
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>
that the Protestant hath all the Authority in its hand in the grand <HI>Imperial Cities</HI> hereof, and the <HI>Hans Towns,</HI> which make up the number of an hundred and fifty, whereof there are but very few to be excepted. The most famous are <HI>Nu∣renburgh, Franck-fort, Wormes, Stratsburg, Ausburg, Ulms, Ratisbone, Spire, Strelsond, Wismar, Rostoch, Stetin, Osna∣burg, Brunswick, Breme, Hamburgh, Lubeck, Dantzick, El∣bing, Conigsberg,</HI> where the Magistrate is Protestant. There is but only <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> where the number of the Ro∣mans surpass the number of the others, and where neverthe∣less these have the free and publick exercise of their Religion, and each live together in peace; though the Romanists daily incroach upon the Protestants, and increase, and the others decrease, and lose their Priviledges and Power, for want of some Heroick Princes to maintain them.</P>
<P>To conclude; The Roman Religion has been carried to the ends of the World, into the East, and into the West In∣dies by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portuguese.</HI> The Protestant has been carried to the same places by the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> also are setled in the Isle of <HI>Madagascar</HI> in <HI>Ca∣nada,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and in <HI>America,</HI> and take their course also through <HI>Asia,</HI> insomuch that all are there generally call'd <HI>Franks.</HI> But these are almost universally <HI>French</HI> Catho∣licks.</P>
<P>But to take things apart; The Roman Religion is spread in some Maritine places of <HI>Asia,</HI> and has it's principal Seat at <HI>Goa,</HI> a Puissant City on the Western Coast of the <HI>Peninsula</HI> on this side <HI>Ganges.</HI> The Protestant upon the shores of the same <HI>Asia,</HI> and has its principal Seat at <HI>Batavia,</HI> a City upon the Southern Coast of <HI>Grand Java,</HI> which the Commerce of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> has rendred famous.</P>
<P>The Roman Religion fills some places of the Eastern Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> as <HI>Melinda, Mosambica, Quiloa;</HI> The Protestant some places of the same <HI>Africa,</HI> upon the Western and Sou∣thern
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>
Coast, as in the Kingdom of <HI>Congo, Guiny,</HI> and <HI>Cape Verd.</HI></P>
<P>The Roman Religion possesses in <HI>America, Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> the Isles of <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> and <HI>Cuba;</HI> also <HI>Brasil</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> and some of the <HI>Antilles</HI> Islands. The Protestant, in like manner, in the same <HI>America, New England, New Swede, New Denmark, New Holland,</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and now of late the Island of <HI>Jamaca,</HI> and the two thirds of the <HI>Antilles</HI> Islands, and heretofore the Northern part of <HI>Brasil,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>By all which you may see how little reason of Geography the Religion <HI>Roman</HI> has, to appropriate the Name <HI>Catho∣lick.</HI></P>
<P>The Jesuites, as has been seen by the first part, have also promoted their Religion, even into <HI>China,</HI> but 'tis not yet be∣come National or powerful.</P>
<P>It rests only to draw hence their Proportions, thus;</P>
<P>The Proportions of <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> ought to be considered, as 1, 3, 4, and 7. So that taking only the Inhabited part of the World, the Christians possess about a sixth, the Mahometans a fifth, or something more; and the Heathens two thirds, or hardly quite so much. So that dividing all the known Regions of the Earth into thirty equal parts; The Christians part shall be as five, the Mahome∣tans as six, and the Heathens as ninteeen, which is very near two thirds of thirty. As for the Christians that are found in <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> their petty number is, as it were, swallowed up in this fearful multitude of Mahometans and Idolators, and is elsewhere counterballanced by that of the Mahometans in <HI>Europe.</HI> And if to the Lands discovered, one joyn that great Southern Continent, which comes near to the very Aequator, and coasts, as it were, continually from East to West, the two other Continents of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> so that it seems to be as large as <HI>Europe, Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> put together;
<PB N="41" REF="24"/>
then the Heathen will surpass the Mahometans and the Christi∣ans in an excessive proportion; for they will then have near as much more; for 'tis to be believed, that that part of the World has no other for its Inhabitants than Idolaters; seeing that they found no other at the point of good <HI>Hope,</HI> and towards the streight of <HI>Magellan,</HI> which are the most neighbouring Lands to this vast Continent of the South, whose shores onely are known unto us.</P>
<P>These are the three grand Branches of the Christian Religi∣on in <HI>Europe,</HI> out of which arise onely three other that are be∣come distinct and National, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Lutheran,</HI> the <HI>Calvinist,</HI> and the <HI>Episcoparian,</HI> all of them Protestant and Reformed; All of them deny the Popes Supremacy and Transubstantiati∣on, &amp;c. The Calvinists deny both Transubstantiation of the Papists, Consubstantiation of the Lutherans, and Episcopacy, and the Discipline of the others. And these again the Pres∣bytery of the Calvinists, Consubstantiation of the Lutherans, and Transubstantiation, Supremacy, &amp;c. of the Papists, only retaining Episcopacy, (which they contend to be Primitive) and some Popish Ceremonies, (which they contend to be in∣different and lawful); all of them at great variance, and with much zeal and animosity each against the other.</P>
<P>There are indeed many other Sects, and Parties, and Opi∣nions shooted out of these; but none to be accounted Gene∣ral, National, or Powerful, though such as have rais'd great Disputes, and Contentions, and overwarm Fewds and Zealous∣ness; and some to Separation from all the former.</P>
<P>And they are either such as are, or may be common to all other, such as are chiefly those about Doctrine; as <HI>Arminia∣nism</HI> and <HI>Antiarminianism, Socinianism,</HI> or <HI>Antisocinianism,</HI> &amp;c. according as Reason and Faith directs each. The <HI>Soci∣nians</HI> are chiefly in <HI>Poland;</HI> The <HI>Arminians</HI> are spread every where. Or else such as separate from all others, chiefly about Discipline, as the <HI>Brownists, Independants,</HI> &amp;c. chiefly in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="24"/>
and <HI>New England;</HI> the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land</HI> also, &amp;c. and other places; the <HI>Quakers,</HI> the latest of all, in <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Latitudinarians,</HI> who submit to any Discipline, and contend only for the Substantials of Religion. <HI>Seekers,</HI> or <HI>Spiritualists,</HI> who submit to no Religion, as whose Religion is to be, not so much against, as above all Religions, or Forms of Religion; All which are comprehensive of most others and, are all generally <HI>Libertinarians,</HI> more or less; that is for liberty of Religion.</P>
<P>Amongst such a company of Religions in the World, what other means possible can there be for Unity, Peace, and Love amongst Christians, or mankind; but Liberty rather than Uni∣formity? For how is it possible there should be Uniformity long, where there's onely necessity, not consent and har∣mony?</P>
<P>There are but few places where liberty of Religion is tole∣rated, and those with difference. Among the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Po∣land, Germany</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> generally all, more or less. In <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Protestants</HI> only. In <HI>New England</HI> all, but errors judg'd fundamental. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> and in <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Avignon,</HI> the <HI>Jews.</HI> But the World will then onely be happy, when it shall once become Universal, that is, as large as the very Universe it self; and mens minds like to Truth it self, noble and free, and not narrow, but large spirited and diffu∣sive, like the infinite Creators, who would have all men to be saved, and that by perswasion, and not force, because impossi∣ble. But we pass by this less pleasing particular.</P>
<P>As also the Commerce, Commodities, Riches and Forces of <HI>Europe,</HI> of which it is enough to say in general, that she commands by Sea all the Riches of the World; and of which enough before, till we come to more particulars, which are best referred to each several Countrey.</P>

<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The late <HI>grand Revolutions</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> have been either of States and Kingdoms, whether for Dominion or Religion; or of Religions themselves, or of both mixtly. We shall onely look so far back as to take a view or prospect of the present face of things, and the Foundations of the present Govern∣ments and Religions before mentioned.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Foundation of the present <HI>Germane Empire,</HI> in the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> which grand Revolution has made it, as it were, Haereditary; and put a period to Liberty of Elections.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. ABout the year 1250. the Empire being greatly di∣stracted through the Popes means and practices (who for above an hundred years had notoriously usurped authority over the Emperors, and made a common practice of excom∣municating them in a manner successively, for so many years one after the other); the Empire, I say, being distracted into many Factions, each Faction chose a King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> or Emperor; insomuch that there were now at one time three Elected together, and a▪fourth a year or two after bought it, and presently left it again, and then for several years without any. The Empire fluctuating thus for about twenty years, and after so long an <HI>Interregnum,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> met at <HI>Quidlinburg,</HI> and made a League of Defence together about the year 1270. Thereupon Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the tenth sends or∣der to them to chuse an Emperor, unless they would have one chose for them. Meeting therefore at <HI>Franck-fort▪</HI> they chose (out of one of the weakest Families, every Faction grown jea∣lous, and fearing the other) <HI>Rodolphus</HI> Earl of <HI>Hapsburg,</HI> in
<PB N="45" REF="25"/>
the year 1270. to be Emperor, the Raiser of the present House of <HI>Austria</HI> upon this occasion, and grand Revolution; for by War, and by his <HI>Imperatorian</HI> Power, gaining <HI>Austria,</HI> and other Territories adjoyning, he confers them upon his Son: And so the Earls of <HI>Hapsburgh</HI> become first Dukes, then Arch-Dukes of <HI>Austria,</HI> about the year 1280. and so propagated their power far and near unto our times.</P>
<P>By this time the seven Electors had rooted themselves in their usurp'd Electorship, which began first by bare permission, and under pretext of avoiding confusion, and for better order in the Election, to take the Votes of all the other Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> what should be best for the Common Interest, af∣terwards used and usurped as their priviledge, and so continu∣ed it, till they got to be established therein by the <HI>Golden Bull.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Golden Bull,</HI> or Seal, is constituted as the perpe∣tual and fundamental Law of the Empire, (not to be altered by the Emperor, no not with the Electors consent themselves) by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fourth, in the year 1356. Yet to which since has been added, <HI>Capitulations</HI> of the Emperor, with the Elec∣tors, and Princes of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>In the Golden Bull was contained the Priviledges, Liber∣ties, Order, and mutual respect between the Emperor and Princes.</P>
<P>In it the seven Electors were established by publick Sancti∣on, and Law of the Empire; before sometimes more, some∣times less, usurped the Power to themselves, which bred dis∣sentions and confusions alwayes in choice.</P>
<P>Also to hinder Haereditary Succession, that three Emperors of one and the same Family should never be chosen together, as had been by Power, Interest, and Factions formerly ac∣customed to keep it in one House; which how well observed the Story will shew, it having continued in that Line ever since, and become in a manner quite haereditary, and scarcely to be altered.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="26"/>
In it also was decided between the House of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Palatine, the Controversie about Electorship, which was by perpetual right then annexed to the Palatinate, and ever since continued so till the late <HI>German</HI> Wars; before each claiming the Electorship, which therefore often disturbed their number to be more or less than seven.</P>
<P N="3">III. About the year 1500. the State of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> which contained the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> was by Marriage with the Hei∣ress thereof, added to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> which further strengthened it.</P>
<P>About the same time under <HI>Maximilian</HI> the first, the pub∣lick Courts of Judicature, which followed the Emperors Court, alwayes before were fixed to a certain place; and this is called the <HI>Imperial Chamber,</HI> the <HI>Supream Tribunal,</HI> and <HI>Ap∣peal of Justice,</HI> in which in Civil Matters, the Emperor and all the Princes should be subject, and the greatest Controversies be submitted to its Judgment.</P>
<P>It was after two removes fixed at last to <HI>Spires;</HI> hence the <HI>Chamber of Spires</HI> fam'd over all; and the Empire also divided into ten Circles, by the same Emperor, at the same time.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Heir of <HI>Burgundy (i. e.</HI> the Emperors Son, by his Wife Heiress thereof) marrying with the Heir of <HI>Spain,</HI> unite the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and the House of <HI>Au∣stria</HI> together, and so the King of <HI>Spain</HI> becomes Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and Lord of the <HI>Low Coun∣tries,</HI> and after his Grand-fathers decease, Emperor also, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Son of <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> Son of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor, succeeds his Father in his Estates of Inheritance of <HI>Spain, Burgundy,</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries, Austria,</HI> &amp;c. and by Election, his Grand-father <HI>Maximilian</HI> in the Empire, in the year 1519. under whom the <HI>German</HI> Em∣pire rose to its greatest height and inlargement ever since the dismembring of it. And indeed with this addition of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="26"/>
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> it might equal it under <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, when it had <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> Members thereof, or subject thereunto; besides the Duke∣dom of <HI>Milan</HI> fell to this <HI>Charles;</HI> also the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and other parts in <HI>Africa</HI> became Tributary; and moreover, married the Daughter of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and so laid a Foundation for that Kingdom also. But if you add the West Indy King∣doms, the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico</HI> overcome, <HI>Anno,</HI> 1521. the Kingdom of <HI>Peru,</HI> 1535. It had more extent, though not greatness and power, than all the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire ever had. And had not the <HI>French</HI> opposed him, he had over-ran all <HI>Europe,</HI> and been Universal Monarch.</P>
<P>He had Prisoners at the same time, the <HI>French</HI> King, and the Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI> He ruin'd the League made by the <HI>Protestants</HI> at <HI>Smalcalde</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> Took Prisoners the Elector of <HI>Saxo∣ny,</HI> and Landgrave of <HI>Hassia,</HI> drove the great Turk from <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> as well as won <HI>Tunis.</HI> But the Turk soon broke his Power in <HI>Africa,</HI> and being hunted out of <HI>Germany,</HI> he re∣signed all his Estates and Kingdoms; the Empire to his Brother, who had been before elected King of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohemia, Anno</HI> 1526. and by the procurement of this <HI>Charles,</HI> elected King of the <HI>Romaus,</HI> 1531. and now by his Resignation, Em∣peror, 1558. The rest of his Estates to his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the Se∣cond King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and so went off the Stage, and died pri∣vate in a Monastery, after he had been glutted, as it were, with the pomp and vanity of the World;</P>
<P>As Emperor of the <HI>Germans,</HI> King of <HI>Castile, Aragon, Na∣ples, Sicily,</HI> &amp;c. Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> Prince of <HI>Belgium,</HI> (or <HI>Low Countries)</HI> &amp;c. King of <HI>India,</HI> and the <HI>Ocean,</HI> &amp;c. Lord of <HI>Africa,</HI> &amp;c. But in the end on∣ly <HI>Monk.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. From this time the <HI>Austrian</HI> House took such rooting in <HI>Germany,</HI> that the Empire is in name rather Elective, but in reality Haereditary, and become the Inheritance, as it were,
<PB N="48" REF="27"/>
of a Family; Specially after he brought in the custom of cre∣ating King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> during the Emperors life, as he did to his Brother, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1531. (which is a Title proper to the Em∣peror) notwithstanding the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who by many Arguments shewed, how it tended to inervate the free election of the Emperor.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Under this <HI>Charles,</HI> all <HI>Germany,</HI> both Empire and Church, is rent into two grand Factions or Parts, <HI>Roman Catho∣licks,</HI> and <HI>Protestants;</HI> the <HI>Protestants</HI> again into <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists;</HI> and from this division arose the two grand Wars, the <HI>Smalcaldick</HI> and <HI>Bohemian.</HI></P>
<P>The chief cause was the general hate of the <HI>Roman</HI> Court and Tyranny, (and base abuses and corruptions thereof) both by the Princes and People, ready to take any occasion against them.</P>
<P>But the occasion was the common selling of Indulgences by an impudent Monk; whom another Monk, but honester, op∣poses. Thus the two Instruments were two Monks, one a ve∣ry Knave, or at best, corrupt ignorant Friar; the other an ho∣nest, sincere, and well-meaning Soul, as well as zealous, <HI>Mar∣tin Luther</HI> by name, (such as were many in those dayes, as <HI>Thauler,</HI> whom <HI>Luther</HI> much esteemed and praises); or if you will give him a truer name from his Deeds, <HI>Martin Marr-Pope,</HI> who at first taxes only the abuse, and observes the corruptions of the Church, become too notorious for any honest heart; but finding no amendment, nor reformation, but things worse and worse, makes a general defection, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1522.</P>
<P>This was no sooner done, but the Reformers make a new Schism, and divide between <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Zwinglius,</HI> 1524. which rose to two grand Factions, afterwards by the name of <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> towards the year 1560. the cause of much woe to <HI>Germany,</HI> and never reconciled, neither by Prin∣ces nor Pastors, till the treaty at <HI>Munster,</HI> 1648.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Germany,</HI> and almost all <HI>Europe,</HI> became divided into
<PB N="49" REF="27"/>
two General Factions or Parts, <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants;</HI> but <HI>Germany</HI> into three, <HI>Papists, Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Calvinists:</HI> which has been the principal cause indeed of all Mutations and Re∣volutions in all the Kingdoms and States ever since almost. Hence the Revolutions of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> &amp;c. must be deriv'd, as from their origi∣nal Head and Spring.</P>
<P>The head of the <HI>Catholicks</HI> was the Emperor, and Popish-Princes; of the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxony;</HI> of the <HI>Cal∣vinists</HI> or Reformed, the Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. And these preceding, occasion'd also other Religions, and Wars for these, at least defensive. For at this time of con∣tending for Liberty and Reformation, arose other Sects also, aiming, or pretending higher Reformation in Religion; So that in the year 1525, one <HI>Thomas Munzer</HI> occasions the Ru∣stick War of the Countrymen. In the year 1534, succeeded the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> at <HI>Munster.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1529 arose the name <HI>Protestant,</HI> in the General Assembly at <HI>Worms,</HI> when the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Land∣grave of <HI>Hasse,</HI> the City of <HI>Noremberg</HI> and others protested against the Decrees of Caesar, and appeal'd to an Universal-Council. In the year following 1530, the Confession of the Protestants, call'd the <HI>Augustan Confession,</HI> was published.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Upon these Grounds chiefly, and a little after the Troubles and Interruptions by the other Sects mentioned, breaks forth the Civil War between <HI>Caesar</HI> and the <HI>Protestants,</HI> called the <HI>Smalcaldick War; Anno</HI> 1547, which they began at <HI>Smalcaldia</HI> in <HI>Hassia:</HI> where Caesar prevails, ruins their League made there, the same year begun and ended. Soon after the <HI>Protestants</HI> revive; prevail, and in the end force the Emperor out of <HI>Germany;</HI> procure the <HI>Passavian</HI> Transaction, (or Peace made there) <HI>An.</HI> 1552, where by a perpetual Edict is establi∣shed Liberty of either Religion, <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> and <HI>Augustan Confession,</HI> (that is, <HI>Protestant.)</HI> So the <HI>Protestants</HI> by agreement
<PB N="50" REF="28"/>
and compact obtain'd full liberty and exemption from the Pa∣pal yoke, and Peace in <HI>Germany</HI> till 1618.</P>
<P N="9">IX. When chiefly from the same hidden causes, grounds and motives, the Bohemian War began: For about the year 1612, <HI>Germany</HI> was again divided into two parts, the <HI>League,</HI> and the <HI>Union.</HI> The League contained the <HI>Papist</HI> Princes, the Union the <HI>Protestant.</HI> Thence about the year 1618, the Bo∣hemians, according to their priyiledge, rejecting the Empe∣ror, as never formally nor legally chosen, (as they had former∣ly done <HI>Uladislaus</HI> the 3d.) elect the Count Palatine King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and crown him at <HI>Prague.</HI> Whence the Bohemian-War arose, and spread over all <HI>Germany;</HI> chang'd first into the Saxon, and then into the Swedish-War, for the support of the German Liberty, and lasted for thirty years, till the Trea∣ty at <HI>Munster.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> overcoming the Bohemians, and the <HI>Palatine</HI> expell'd, demands and obtains the Electorship, (which for a hundred and fifty years before had been claimed and controverted, but by the Golden-Bull decided to the <HI>Pa∣latine)</HI> notwithstanding the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> and Marquess of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> gainsaying, but not daring to resist; about the year 1620: And so the <HI>Palatine</HI> was ejected out of the upper Palatinate, and the first place among the Electoral Princes Secular, as well as the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>

<P>All the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> anciently were Electors in com∣mon; and no distinction between Electors and Non-Electors.</P>
<P>The Princes, and consequently the Electors, were and are absolute Princes, in their own Estates.</P>
<P>Electors began about the year 1000, under <HI>Otho</HI> the third; by permission only for convenience of taking Votes, and a∣voiding Confusions, and by the prevalency of the more potent, under specious pretences.</P>
<P>No certain number of Electors at first, but sometimes more, sometimes less.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> exercises the Vicarship in vacancy of the Empire; But the <HI>Palatine</HI> disputed it at the chusing of this present Emperor, 1658.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> convocated the Protestant Princes, 1630, for a Defensive League, who conclude to maintain Liberty by Arms; and so it becomes a Saxonick War.</P>

<P>The Marquess of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> has the largest Dominions of all, being Duke of <HI>Pomerania</HI> many ages since. <HI>Prussia</HI> was divided between him and <HI>Poland;</HI> he to have the title of Duke of the whole, and to hold his part with some Homage to <HI>Poland, An.</HI> 1525.

The Princes nominated and substituted by the Turk in opposition to the Emperor. The Protestants choosing rather to fall under the Turk, than the Emperor, finding more mercy and liberty from him; or rather from between both: Their Princes being maintained and substituted by the <HI>Turk</HI> against the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and again defended by th' <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> from being made wholly thrall to the <HI>Turk,</HI> to whom their Princes are tributary.</P>
<P>Hence Wars and Troubles with the Princes of <HI>Transylvania</HI> as well as Turk; they often by War invading Caesar.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Bathor</HI> makes work, 1601. Next, <HI>Botskay</HI> makes war, about 1606.

<P>About 1350, they cross the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> or Narrow-Sea, out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> hiring the Genoa's Ships: For what foot∣ing they had before in <HI>Gallipolis</HI> was inconsiderable by Land; having subdued <HI>Nice,</HI> the Imperial Seat of the Eastern, <HI>i. e.</HI> Graecian Emperors, in the time of <HI>Ottoman</HI> before mentioned.</P>

With this king the <HI>English</HI> first began to confederate.</P>
<P>To him succeeds, <HI>An.</HI> 1583, his Son <HI>Theodore,</HI> of a good disposition, the last of the former race; who dying without issue, <HI>Russia</HI> becomes distracted with unheard of Confusions and Miseries: For through fault in Government, and the Line failing, there sprang horrible Factions and Commotions in the kingdom for ten years, scarce to be parallel'd in History.</P>
<P>For <HI>John Basilid</HI> having two Sons left, <HI>Demetrius</HI> and <HI>Theo∣dore,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="34"/>
the former was secretly made away and kill'd, before his Father's death, and <HI>Theodore</HI> leaving no issue, leaves the king∣dom to his Brother-in-law, who proving an unmerciful Ty∣rant, The Jesuites take occasion to suborn a certain Scholar of theirs in their Colledge in <HI>Poland,</HI> a <HI>Russe</HI> by Nation, for the true <HI>Demetrius</HI> made away; so cunningly, that none of the <HI>Russians,</HI> especially the fickle-minded multitude, doubted, but that it was the true and lawful Heir indeed, and therefore generally flock to him, which the other Tyrant seeing, either with Grief or Poyson ended his dayes, <HI>An.</HI> 1605. and the false <HI>Demetrius</HI> made absolute Monarch of <HI>Russia.</HI> The king of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Pope favouring the design. But the Russes soon smelling him out by his forreign manners and customs, The Nobles conspire against him, and behead him the next year.</P>
<P>The Impostor slain, the stronger Faction thus prevailing, make <HI>Zusky</HI> the Chief their Conspiracy, <HI>An.</HI> 1606, Emperor.</P>
<P>But then presently another <HI>Demetrius,</HI> as escaping by Mi∣racle, and by and by in opposition to him a third, begin to peep up, one in the Western, the other in the Nothern parts by se∣veral Factions, so that stil <HI>Demetrius</HI> as often as slain, rises again. But this last soon vanished.</P>
<P>Hereupon the <HI>Poles,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> take their advantage, break-in on every side, under pretext of help, and the <HI>Russians</HI> become a prey to them all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> help <HI>Zuskie,</HI> and the Poles <HI>Demetrius, Anno</HI> 1611, the <HI>Swedes</HI> take <HI>Novograd,</HI> and the <HI>Poles Smolensko.</HI></P>
<P>The Russes, weary of these Impostures and Confusions, seek out for a forreign Prince, <HI>An.</HI> 1612▪ some for the <HI>Pole,</HI> others for the <HI>Swede.</HI> The Pole takes <HI>Mosco</HI> (it self) and with Fire and Sword lay it in the dust, 200000 Russes perishing therein. The <HI>Swedes</HI> eject the <HI>Poles</HI> out of <HI>Mosco</HI> again. But the Southern <HI>Russes</HI> take <HI>Zusky,</HI> send him into <HI>Poland,</HI> and by recommendation and the power of the Polanders, chuse the
<PB N="64" REF="35"/>
King of <HI>Polands</HI> Son, create him Great Duke: and the Nor∣thern chuse <HI>Charles</HI> the Brother of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> King of Sweden.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Russes</HI> loth to fall under the power of the <HI>Poles,</HI> and desirous of settlement after such tiresome confusions, and see∣ing themselves a scorn and prey to strangers, do by the ad∣vice and counsel first of a Butcher only, seek out a fit person of their own Nation, and make choice at last of their Patri∣arch of <HI>Mosco</HI>'s Son, <HI>An.</HI> 1615, who presently makes this But∣cher Treasurer and General, and at length settles this vast Em∣pire, and manages it in a more constant way of Peace with the <HI>Turks, Tartars, Poles,</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> than any of his predeces∣sors before, and founds the present Family and Empire.</P>
<P>Yet the second <HI>Demetrius</HI>'s Widow hires the <HI>Cossacks</HI> to set up her young Son, not of age, who takes many Eastern Pro∣vinces of <HI>Russia,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Kingdom</HI> for her Son, the fourth false <HI>Demetrius;</HI> But this Kingdom lasted but two years: for both Mother and Son were taken and slain by the <HI>Russes.</HI></P>
<P>So the Emperor first makes peace with <HI>Swede,</HI> who restor'd to him the Great Dukedom of <HI>Novograd,</HI> but keeps <HI>Livonia,</HI> (and other Northern Provinces) with the City <HI>Novograd,</HI> and add it to their Crown, since the occasion of War between them. He then besieges <HI>Smolensko</HI> 1634, and there receives a great and shameful Overthrow and Destruction by the <HI>Poles;</HI> which Dukedom has ever since been the Apple of Contention, as well as formerly, betwixt them. He reigned till 1645.</P>
<P>To whom succeeded his young Son <HI>Alexius,</HI> the present Emperor; In 1646 they made peace with <HI>Poland,</HI> and du∣ring the Kings minority there was some troubles and distem∣pers in the State, and an horrible Sedition 1648. but all soon quietly setled.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1654. The Moscovites invade <HI>Lituania;</HI> overcome <HI>Smolensko;</HI> and 1655, take <HI>Vilna;</HI> invade <HI>Livonia.</HI> 1656,
<PB N="65" REF="35"/>
The <HI>Cossacks</HI> (a Confederate Army of Rogues and Robbers, that take either side for their Prey, or Money, or other ends and designs, or as they are pleased or displeased with affairs; and belong chiefly to <HI>Poland;)</HI> they joyn with the <HI>Poles,</HI> and defeat the <HI>Moscovites, anno</HI> 1659. The <HI>Poles</HI> prosper. But the <HI>Cossacks</HI> at last break Faith, and again rebel to the <HI>Moscovites;</HI> and invade and spoyl some Provinces.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1660 <HI>Czarneckie</HI> in <HI>Lituania</HI> beats the Muscovites. Their Army also in <HI>Poland</HI> under <HI>Zeremetzie</HI> reduc'd to straits, and forced to surrender themselves to the <HI>Poles. Vilna</HI> in <HI>Litua∣nia</HI> besieged by the <HI>Poles</HI> till next year. <HI>An.</HI> 1662, The <HI>Mos∣covite</HI> beats the <HI>Tartars;</HI> Overcomes the <HI>Cossacks</HI> under <HI>Chimi∣linsky;</HI> But again overcome by <HI>Cossacks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> And 1664, The <HI>Moscovites</HI> overcome, and beat by the <HI>Pole.</HI> Peace since between them. The Emperor of <HI>Moscovia</HI> now sollicits for the election of his Son to the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> offers fair Conditions, and that he shall change his Religion from the Greek to the Roman; which would have much influence upon the Jesuites perhaps, and zealous Religionists of the Papists; if Reason of State otherwayes did not hinder.</P>
<P>The great Enemies you see of the <HI>Russes</HI> then are the <HI>Pole,</HI> the <HI>Swede,</HI> and the <HI>Tartar,</HI> helpt by the <HI>Turk: Anno</HI> 1230, the <HI>Tartars</HI> over-ran all <HI>Russia,</HI> and made it tributary, and for three hundred years kept their Power over it more or less, and gave and took away Dukes over them, as they pleased. <HI>Anno</HI> 1500 <HI>Basil</HI> shook off this yoke. Yet <HI>Anno</HI> 1570 an hundred thousand <HI>Tartars</HI> on a sudden overran <HI>Mosco,</HI> and laid it whol∣ly in Ashes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Russes</HI> strive for the Dukedom of <HI>Smolensko</HI> and <HI>Severia,</HI> which both claim; and both win and take con∣tinually. Of late years the <HI>Cossacks</HI> with all <HI>Ukrain,</HI> revolted to the <HI>Russes.</HI> But since Peace and Compositions of things made.</P>

success of Arms has expell'd both the <HI>Russe</HI> and the <HI>Pole,</HI> and annex'd it to their Crown. Hence the Wars between the <HI>Russe</HI> and <HI>Swede</HI> continually. <HI>Riga</HI> has been often attempted and besieg'd in vain by the <HI>Russe.</HI> But we pass to their next neighbour <HI>Poland.</HI></P>

<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The Revolutions of <HI>Poland.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> has for many ages been a distinct Soveraignty.</P>
<P>The first that was elective, was <HI>Piastus</HI> (after the failure of the former line) a plain Country-man, elected Duke of <HI>Po∣land, An.</HI> 800. Afterwards became a Kingdom, still in <HI>Piastus</HI>'s line.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1320. <HI>Silesia</HI> fell from <HI>Poland</HI> to <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and could never be recovered.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1386. They made the Great Duke of <HI>Lituania,</HI> by mar∣riage into their King's Family, King; and so joyn'd that great Dukedom to <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1466. <HI>Casimir</HI> adds <HI>Prussia;</HI> and 1561 <HI>Livonia</HI> is added to it also.</P>
<P>The Royal Family being extinct, they chuse forreign Prin∣ces, <HI>anno</HI> 1573. and first chuse the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> Brother of <HI>Charles the</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> about the year 1575. But he quickly left it for the Crown of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1579, they chose <HI>Bathor</HI> Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> by re∣commendation of the Turks. He firmly united <HI>Livonia</HI> to the Crown, and had a great hand upon the <HI>Moscovites.</HI></P>
<P>He dying without issue, they chose <HI>Sigismund</HI> the King of <HI>Swede</HI>'s Son, about the year 1590; (whose posterity has ever since enjoy'd it; but now the line fails.) He joyn'd the King∣dom of <HI>Swede</HI> and <HI>Poland;</HI> But turning Papist, endeavours by the Jesuites perswasions to disturb Religion in <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and so was ejected, and losing his Patrimonial kingdom, on∣ly keeps <HI>Poland.</HI> Hence those lasting Wars between the two Nations.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="36"/>
To him succeeded <HI>Uladislaus,</HI> famous for the memorable Victory against the <HI>Moscovites,</HI> besieging <HI>Smolensko, an.</HI> 1634.</P>
<P>After whose death, <HI>Anno</HI> 1647, The kingdom became ex∣treamly imbroyl'd by Factions, specially by the mutinous and seditious <HI>Cossacks</HI> (a Rebellious Army, as it were of Boors, and Moss-troopers, that live upon prey and rapine, and serve any side, as was hinted (risen first and chiefly out of the wild parts of <HI>Poland, Lituania,</HI> &amp;c. next <HI>Russia;)</HI> who at this time began to be more troublesome than ever, during all the present king <HI>Casimir</HI>'s Reign, and not fully setled till very lately; and per∣haps not to hold long neither.</P>
<P>King <HI>Casimir</HI> succeeded, <HI>an.</HI> 1648. so troubled all his dayes, that he has been a long time weary of his Crown, and now at last laid it down, not obtaining leave to nominate his Successor.</P>
<P>The better to understand the late Revolutions of <HI>Poland,</HI> in brief, take them thus.</P>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> has suffered great Revolutions and Troubles, from forreign Enemies, Rebellious <HI>Cossacks,</HI> and Confederate No∣bles. Grand Enemies are the <HI>Swede,</HI> the <HI>Russe,</HI> the <HI>Tar∣tar,</HI> and the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>The Wars with the <HI>Swede</HI> are for <HI>Livonia,</HI> for pretence to the Crown of <HI>Swede,</HI> for Titles and Arms. Hereupon the late king of <HI>Sweden</HI> overran in one year almost all <HI>Poland,</HI> but lost all again the next. But these pretences now cease in the pre∣sent king, having no heirs.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Russes</HI> for several causes before mentioned: With the <HI>Tartars,</HI> (commonly call'd the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI> distinct from those in <HI>Asia;</HI> these bordering upon <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Poland)</HI> who make yearly Incursions almost for prey and plunder; either as friends or enemies, all's one. Therefore the <HI>Tartars</HI> do not seek to conquer so much as to plunder <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>But the greatest Enemies are the <HI>Turks,</HI> ever since they got <HI>Walachia, Moldavia,</HI> and <HI>Transylvania,</HI> the Walls &amp; Bulwarks as it were of <HI>Poland,</HI> and also the Tartars to be subject to them.
<PB N="68" REF="37"/>
But they have yet <HI>threatned</HI> more than <HI>done</HI> any thing; and little has passed, besides consultings and fears hitherto betwixt them.</P>
<P>The seditious and mutinous <HI>Cossacks</HI> have done most mis∣chief. One of the chief causes of their Rebellion was the great oppression of the Natives, by the <HI>Jews,</HI> in all the Customs and Tributes almost of the Kingdom, granted to them by King <HI>Casimir,</HI> and ever since possessed by them, by the means of <HI>Esther</HI> a Jewish, in behalf of her Nation, who obtain'd great Priviledges for them.</P>
<P>And in the late fatal Confusions of <HI>Poland,</HI> the <HI>Russians</HI> again besieged <HI>Smolensko,</HI> and seiz'd not only on it, but all <HI>Ukrain,</HI> or <HI>black Russia,</HI> and great part of <HI>Lituania.</HI></P>
<P>The occasion whereof was, first, the Jesuites taking away the <HI>Russes</HI> Temples, and hindring the free Liberty of Religion to them. Next, the Nobles Tyranny over the Peasants, killing them at their pleasure. Hence inraged, they rise up against their Masters, kill the Jesuites and Priests, call the Cossacks and Tartars to their help, and mutual prey.</P>
<P>These mischiefs increased during the <HI>Poles</HI> dissention about Election of a King, and had like to have ruin'd all <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>After long Contentions, they chose <HI>Casimir,</HI> Brother of the deceased King, who being not enough assisted by his People▪ backward then to wage War, is circumvented by the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> and forc'd to those Conditions of Peace that the present Ne∣cessity required.</P>
<P>To all which Evils succeeded War with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and lastly with the Nobles under <HI>Lubomirskie,</HI> about nominating a Successor during the King's Reign, &amp;c. We will recollect and summe the passages according to the years they happened in.</P>
<P><HI>Uladislaus</HI> dyes, 1648. <HI>Casimir</HI> constituted, 1649, who marches against the Rebellious Cossacks.</P>
<P>The King marries his Brothers Widow, 1651. Poles beat Tartars and Cossacks, and put them to flight.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="37"/>
1654. The Moscovite with 40000, breaks into <HI>Lituania,</HI> and takes <HI>Smolensko,</HI> so often won and lost. For <HI>An.</HI> 1500 a Poland Noble-man betray'd it to the Moscovite. The Poles recover it 1610. The Moscovite attempts it 1634, but beaten then shamefully, and now take it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>1655. King of <HI>Swede</HI> marches against <HI>Poland,</HI> and overrun all in a years time. The <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> per force Confe∣derates with him.</P>
<P>1656. Moscovite takes <HI>Vilna</HI> in <HI>Lituania.</HI></P>
<P>1657. <HI>Ragotzi</HI> marches into <HI>Poland:</HI> but loses all his Army, and then his own Country. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> agrees with the Pole, prevailing against the Swede.</P>
<P>1658. The Rebel Cossacks overcome by General <HI>Wyhoskie.</HI></P>
<P>1659. The Cossacks joyn'd with Poles, beat the Moscovites. The Poles prevail, and prosper. At last the Cossacks break Faith given to the Poles, and again rebel to the Moscovite, and spoil the Poland Provinces.</P>
<P>1660. The War between Swede, and Pole confederate with <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> ended, and peace made; and <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> made absolute over <HI>Prussia,</HI> 1663, and they swear to him again.</P>
<P>The Moscovite overcome by <HI>Pole</HI> and <HI>Czarneskie.</HI> Also the Moscovian Army under <HI>Zeremetzie</HI> reduced to straits, for∣ced to yeeld. <HI>Vilna</HI> Tower besieg'd by Poles to the next year.</P>
<P>1661. The Poland Army, and Lituanian Army confederate together against the King. Whence many Mischiefs to both Countries. <HI>Czarneskie</HI> adhering to the King, over∣comes the Moscovites, under <HI>Cowanskie; Vilna</HI> and other places in <HI>Lituania</HI> taken from the Moscovites.</P>
<P>1662. The confederate Army under <HI>Schwidersky</HI> make a stricter Confederacy; and several thousands enter <HI>Prus∣sia,</HI> and demand Tribute or Taxes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cossacks</HI> under <HI>Chimilinsky</HI> besieging a place, are beat by
<PB N="70" REF="38"/>
the Moscovite under <HI>Romadonofsky.</HI> But the Moscovites afterwards are overcome by the Cossacks and Tartars.</P>
<P>The Lituanian Confederate Army kill their chief Marshal and Treasurer.</P>
<P>1663. The Confederate Armies in <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lituania</HI> dis∣solve their Confederacy, and agree with the <HI>King,</HI> and their General <HI>Lubomirsky,</HI> victorious in Battel against the <HI>King,</HI> restor'd again. And so the Civil War between the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Nobility</HI> drew towards an end.</P>
<P>1664. <HI>K.</HI> of <HI>Poland</HI> takes many Towns from the Cossacks. A famous Victory by General <HI>Packs</HI> or <HI>Pasky</HI> against <HI>Wi∣kousky</HI> General of the Rebel Cossacks. They are reduc'd under the <HI>King</HI>'s power to obedience. The Moscovites overcome by the Lituanians. Since peace and settlement of things has been transacting on all sides, not without dif∣ficulty and new troubles to the <HI>King,</HI> about nominating his Successour, being ever since about laying down his Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>And now at last, having first quieted and satisfied all parties as much as possible, has left the Crown unto Factions and Competitors, (not being able to nominate a Successor be∣fore he left it) and eased himself of such a burden. The whole business now being about Succession, concerning which observe.</P>
<P>Of the Election of <HI>Poland,</HI></P>
<P>First, the Power of the Nobles; Secondly, the Competi∣tors for the Crown.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>For the Power of Election.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The Power of the Nobles is exceeding great, and each single Noble is as it were a single King, and hath Soveraign power over his Slaves, even of Life and Death.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Nobles choose the King, and prescribe what Laws they like.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="71" REF="38"/>
3. If any will not accept these Laws, they proclaim PI∣ASTUS, <HI>i. e.</HI> they will go to the choosing of some Rustick, or plain Country-man of their own Nation.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are perpetual strifes between the Nobles, and Se∣nators, or Council. The Senators favour the King, the No∣bles the Kingdom.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is a like power of all the Nobles, so that one dissenting, the other Suffrages are void; and one only Noble hath right to intercede in the Diet, or Parliament, against all, and to plead the Cause.</P>
<P>When all the rest had given their consent, a Noble stands up once and said, <HI>I do not consent.</HI> Being asked his Reason; sayes, <HI>Because I am a Noble:</HI> Nor did they reckon the Decree good, till they had his Consent.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the Parliament or Diet of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Deputies of the Nobility, and the publick Liberty, (call'd <HI>Land-Nuncio's,</HI> or <HI>Messengers)</HI> to plead strongly their Cause against the King and Senators of the Kingdom, are of greatest Authority. For the Nobles are alwayes afraid lest they should lose their Pri∣viledges to the King, which are so great.</P>
<P>Next for the Competitors Eligible, know,</P>
<P>First, that though the Kingdom be Elective, yet they ne∣ver past by the Kings Family to choose others; but when the Line fails, then they seek strangers, and grievous Factions arise before they can agree.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Competitors have been (1.) the <HI>Mosco∣vite,</HI> because of the same Language, and Nation originally, and Neighbourhood. (2.) The <HI>Crim Tartar,</HI> urging that He is powerful, and able to bring an hundred thousand Horse in∣to the Field; That he is hardy, and can live at a low rate; That as for Religion, so controverted and disputed in <HI>Poland</HI> with such Commotions, he will not stand for that, they shall have what they will: <HI>Thy Luther,</HI> says he, <HI>My Luther; Thy Pope, my Pope,</HI> as once in his Ambassadors Letters Credentials he
<PB N="72" REF="39"/>
wrote; <HI>And that rather than put them to any charge to find his Ta∣ble, he could live with Horseflesh.</HI> His Embassy thereupon enter∣tain'd with laughter. (3.) The House of <HI>Austria,</HI> specially since one Faction chose the Archduke <HI>Maximilian:</HI> but the pre∣vailing, the King of Swedes Son by the King of Polands Sister; yet <HI>Maximilian</HI> reserv'd both right and title. (4.) The King of <HI>France,</HI> ever since <HI>Charles the</HI> 9<HI>ths</HI> time, when they chose his Brother the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> afterwards King of <HI>France.</HI> Ever since which the French have alwayes cherished some par∣ty against the House of <HI>Austria</HI> and Emperor; specially after that the last King but this, <HI>viz. Uladislaus,</HI> fetch'd his Wife out of <HI>France,</HI> marrying the Dutchess of <HI>Nevers,</HI> whom this K. <HI>Casimir</HI> his Brother, also married after his death. (5.) Of late there also was great endeavours (and underhand) for the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s Son, Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> after this Kings death, or some other addicted to the French. But this distasted the Nobles and would not do.</P>
<P>But since the Resignation of the Crown, the present Stri∣vers for it are the <HI>Moscovit</HI>'s Son, who will turn <HI>Romanist,</HI> and makes fair promises for it. The Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> or <HI>Ne∣vers,</HI> whom the King of <HI>France</HI> endeavours to promote; and the Emperor and other Princes put in for others. But all lies in the will and pleasure of the Nobles, as they can agree.</P>
<P>The present king <HI>Casimir</HI> is above threescore years old, and besides his age and the ordinary cares of a Crown, has never had one peaceable moment; but perpetual troubles all his dayes, either with the <HI>Cossacks</HI> or <HI>Tartars,</HI> or the <HI>Mosco∣vites,</HI> or the <HI>Swedes,</HI> or the Confederates; So that he has had reason enough to be at last weary of a Crown in his old days, and to rest; And indeed layes it down not without honour, having first reduced the Confederates, and setled affairs, else had done it sooner, lest it should be thought he did it by force, and because he could keep it no longer, rather than choise; and rather outed of it, than voluntarily left it.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="39"/>
Note, that these <HI>Cossacks,</HI> so often mentioned, inhabit the Eastern parts of <HI>Poland</HI> towards the <HI>Russes</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> and made but one Body under their General <HI>Chimilnisky,</HI> who some years ago made a great noise in the World; But were of late divided into three Bands, whereof one adheres to the <HI>Moscovite,</HI> the other to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and a third contend for Liberty under the Orders of their General <HI>Tetera;</HI> Beside the Army of the Confederates that was, but now dissolved.</P>
<P>By all which it appears that <HI>Poland</HI> has declined much. 1. By the loss of <HI>Walachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia</HI> to the Turks. 2. By the Revolt of the <HI>Cossacks</HI> and <HI>black Russes,</HI> with all <HI>Ukrain.</HI> 3. By the <HI>Moscovites</HI> possessing, or spoyling and laying waste a great part of <HI>Lituania.</HI> 4. By the Confederacy and Civil War of the Nobles with the King, Victors in fight under <HI>Lubo∣mirsky;</HI> though at last, weary of their own Confusions, both sides hearkned to Reason, and made a Composure. And thus much of the confused story of <HI>Polands</HI> Confusions. <HI>Sweden</HI> lies next concerned in our way.</P>

<HEAD>The Revolutions of <HI>Swedeland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The three Kingdoms of <HI>Denmark, Norway,</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> of old were often united and reunited, till at last 1523, finally severed.

<P>Hereupon the Nobles, to whom <HI>Christiern</HI> had been odious for his Tyranny over them, through means of the Citizens and Commons favouring him against them, elect his Uncle <HI>Frederick</HI> Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> Ring of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> upon certain Conditions, and with great and large Privi∣ledges to themselves reserv'd, <HI>An.</HI> 1523, which they stifly al∣wayes maintain'd, and afterwards under <HI>Frederick the</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> en∣creased, and made them far greater, so that they had right of Majesty and Soveraignty in common with the Ring, till lately in the year 1661, that they lost their ancient priviledges.</P>

<P N="3">3. About the year 988. <HI>Hugh Capet</HI> Earl of <HI>Paris,</HI> a place of something the like power with that of <HI>Maire</HI> formerly, outed the <HI>Caroline</HI> Family.</P>
<P N="4">4. This <HI>Capetine</HI> Race has gone in three Families. First, in a direct Line till 1328. Then in the House of <HI>Valois,</HI> till <HI>Henry the</HI> 4<HI>th</HI> of the House of <HI>Bourbon, an.</HI> 1589. And ever since un∣der <HI>Lewis the</HI> 13<HI>th</HI> &amp; 14<HI>th</HI> in the same House. For <HI>Henry the</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> the last of the <HI>Valoises,</HI> created king of <HI>Poland,</HI> fled privily thence, upon the death of his Brother <HI>Charles the</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> Ring of <HI>France,</HI> and succeeded him thereupon. <HI>Anno</HI> 1574 makes war against the <HI>Hugonites,</HI> (then in Arms upon the horrid Massacres not long before committed upon them) and makes a new League with the <HI>Guises,</HI> called the <HI>Holy League,</HI> to root out the <HI>Hugonots.</HI></P>
<P>For about this time there had been Commotions and Wars for Religion and Self-defence, upon the growth of <HI>Calvin's</HI> Doctrine and Reformation; and the Ringdom became divi∣ded into two Factions, partly Ecclesiastick, the <HI>Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Hugonots;</HI> and partly Civil, the Duke of <HI>Montmorrency,</HI> or <HI>Conde,</HI> (that is the <HI>Bourbons)</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> (that is of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> of the Race of <HI>Charles the Great▪)</HI> Hence sharp Wars.

through the power and favour of the <HI>Catholicks</HI> to the <HI>Guises,</HI> the Head and Ringleaders of them, sides with the <HI>Hugonites,</HI> or they with him, besieges <HI>Paris,</HI> which they had seiz'd on; but was there stabb'd by a Monk, made use of by the <HI>Guisans</HI> and that Faction, <HI>an.</HI> 1589. and so the Family of the <HI>Valois</HI> ended, and the <HI>Bourbons</HI> succeeds, Namely</P>
<P><HI>Henry the</HI> 4<HI>th,</HI> next Heir Male, King of <HI>Navar,</HI> who con∣tinues War against the Leaguists, who strongly oppos'd him; but he greatly breaks them, till at last seeing Religion the only hindrance to his quiet settlement in that Crown, and the quite ruining of that <HI>League</HI> against him, was prevail'd on to turn <HI>Catholick,</HI> and so establish'd the present House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and granted good terms to the <HI>Protestants,</HI> but was afterwards stabb'd by <HI>Ravillac,</HI> of the Romish and Jesuitical Faction.</P>
<P>The first occasion (as was hinted) of these Troubles was the Massacre at <HI>Merindal, Anno</HI> 1545. but specially the great Mas∣sacre at <HI>Paris,</HI> and thereupon presently throughout the whole kingdom, <HI>an.</HI> 1572. from which time the <HI>Holy League</HI> began;</P>
<P>Which was a Sacred Confederation of the Pope, king of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> for the Catholick Religion, and to root out Hereticks.

<P><HI>Lewis the</HI> 13<HI>th</HI> his Son succeeded 1610, the most absolute King of <HI>France</HI> since <HI>Charles the Great:</HI> For he reduc'd the Protestants to his obedience, and all the Forts and Castles held by them, to the number of three hundred, diminishes the Li∣berty of Religion granted by <HI>Henry the fourth</HI> by Decree, or∣dering that all the Protestants should be in all things equal with the Catholicks, and enjoy the same Priviledges and Immuni∣ties.

<HEAD>The Foundation and Revolutions of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI></HEAD>
<P>After the breaking of the Roman Empire, there was a Kingdom founded over all <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> by the <HI>West Goths,</HI> coming out of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>This Kingdom was destroyed afterwards by the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Saracens.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Goths</HI> began soon after to revive again, and to erect several lesser Kingdoms, by degrees as they could; which in time were variously united and disunited again, and perpetual Wars with one another.</P>
<P>The grand division at last was into the kingdom of the <HI>Moors</HI> and of the Christians, or <HI>Goths.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="44"/>
The <HI>Moors</HI> Kingdom in the end fixed only in <HI>Andalusia,</HI> or most Southern parts of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Christians became divided also in time into four chief Kingdoms, <HI>Castile, Arragon, Navarre,</HI> and <HI>Portugal;</HI> which could never unite till.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Great, sirnamed <HI>the Catholick King of Arragon,</HI> laid the Foundations of the last and greatest Monar∣chy of <HI>Spain,</HI> by marriage with <HI>Isabel</HI> Queen of <HI>Castile,</HI> &amp;c. towards the year 1480. in which Race continued ever since.</P>
<P>Whereupon mighty things ensued: (1.) Perpetual Union betwixt those two potent Kingdoms. (2.) The utter root∣ing out presently thereupon the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Saracens</HI> from the kingdom of <HI>Andalusia;</HI> (who had held <HI>Spain</HI> more or less in subjection for seven hundred years) <HI>Anno</HI> 1492. Upon which they presum'd to stile themselves <HI>King and Queen of Spain,</HI> i. e. all <HI>Spain)</HI> to the prejudice of <HI>Navarre</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> who were yet distinct Kingdoms. (3.) The seizing on the kingdom of <HI>Navarre,</HI> whereto belonged <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> &amp;c. (4.) The discovery of the New World, <HI>America,</HI> the year 1492. After which they had the title of <HI>Catholick</HI> by the Pope, to the pre∣judice of all other Kingdoms. (5.) The marrying of their only Daughter and Heir to <HI>Philip</HI> the Emperors Son, Arch∣duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Prince of the Netherlands, thereby uniting those great Estates; and laying the Foundation also for the present <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness and Family, continued ever since, by so many intermarriages, between the Spanish and Imperial branches of that potent Family.</P>
<P>And thus the Spaniards first became considerable in the World, and a Terror to Neighbours; and suddenly look'd like the beginners of a fifth, or Universal Monarchy of the World, at least the New-World:</P>
<P>Which they affected, first, in Title, Getting (1.) that of Catholick Kings, after they had usurped that of Kings of <HI>Spain;</HI> as designed by the Pope for Universal or Catholick
<PB N="84" REF="45"/>
Monarch, to promote the Catholick Cause on Religion; to root out Hereticks, &amp;c. which has been alwayes their pretext, and which they have been alwayes zealous and mighty stick∣lers for. And (2) they have hereby claimed prerogative over all other Kings, and by pretext of their Title, have ever since look'd on themselves as the Greatest Monarchs of all the World; as indeed they had the greatest Dominions. And this would have been a fair step to be the Head of Kingdoms, as the Pope was of the Church. And just such beginnings had the Pope himself over all other Bishops.</P>
<P>Secondly, by Arms. For there remained two kingdoms in <HI>Spain: Portugal</HI> and <HI>Navarre▪</HI> both which they seize on. First that of <HI>Navarre,</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> &amp;c. Whence perpetuall Wars ever since with <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> &amp;c. For this King∣dom, which still retains the Title, and by Arms continually requires the possession. And then of <HI>Portugal</HI> by <HI>Philip the</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> about sixty years after, <HI>viz.</HI> about the 1560.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by Shipping and Sea-Forces, or Power at Sea; specially afterwards with their Invincible Armado in 88, where∣in were above thirty thousand Souldiers, to joyn with as many out of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> And again afterwards with as great Preparation against the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> (but to as little purpose too) in the year 1640; aiming at Superiority and Dominion of the Northern Seas, and consequently of all the World. But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>English</HI> were grown, by that time of the World, too big to do any good on them.</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>Ferdinand the Catholick</HI> succeeds <HI>Philip</HI> Archduke of <HI>Austria,</HI> &amp;c. before-mentioned, Son to <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Em∣peror, about 1504.</P>
<P N="3">3. After whom comes <HI>Charles the</HI> 5<HI>th, An.</HI> 1516. king of <HI>Spain,</HI> Archduke of <HI>Austria;</HI> Duke of <HI>Milan, Burgundy, Brabant;</HI> Earl of <HI>Catalonia, Flanders, Holland,</HI> &amp;c. and Em∣peror of the <HI>Germans;</HI> under whom the Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> grew towards its greatest height;</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="45"/>
He added the Realms of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> the Dukedom of <HI>Milan,</HI> and several Estates in the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> Marched into <HI>Africa,</HI> possesses <HI>Tunis,</HI> and other parts thereby disposing Kingdoms there at his pleasure. But was at last soon outed of the Empire, as a foresaid, leaving <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and other Spanish Territories too.</P>
<P N="4">4. His Son <HI>Philip</HI> the 2d. <HI>An.</HI> 1558. under whom this Kingdom recieved its utmost increase by <HI>Portugal</HI> and the <HI>East Indies</HI> therewith; and also its greatest decrease by the <HI>Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>For upon the death of <HI>Sebastian</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> slain in <HI>Africa,</HI> without Issue, appeared six chief Competitors for the Crown. Of all whom the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> had most right; but the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> notwithstanding all the help from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> got it.

<P N="5">5. Which mighty Monarchy, labouring with its own weight, soon began to fall into peeces; (1) through exhausting of its people, and want of men by naval expeditions into both <HI>Indies;</HI> by many and long Wars; by ejecting the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> be∣fore &amp; afterwards, &amp;c. by the Spanish Inquisition and grievous Taxes and oppressions of the Countrymen, and labourers.

(2) By wasting of its Riches and Wealth; by Wars, and im∣prudence. (3) By loss of kingdoms and Provinces, as well as great defeats of its Armies, and <HI>Armado's.</HI> As namely the loss of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the Defeat in 88, the long Wars with the French, (who alwayes oppos'd this rising Monarchy on all sides) which brought lastly the revolt of <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Catalo∣nia;</HI> and so the loss of half their entire united Monarchy; besides the new conquests in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the last year, by the <HI>French;</HI> all which have made pretty wide gaps in those nume∣rous swelling titles.</P>
<P N="6">6. But this great Kingdom was chiefly impair'd by the Re∣volt of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>For this <HI>Philip</HI> in indeavouring to bring Tyrannick Govern∣ment both Civil and Religious, specially the last; by the blou∣dy Inquisition; and to reduce them back a gain by force to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from that Reformation of Religion, which was now every where begun (whereof he was a violent Ene∣my;) was by a great part of the Provinces confederate toge∣ther, rejected from being their Prince, <HI>An.</HI> 1581. for seeing the Spaniards would bring in absolute domination, both over Soul and Body, they became desperate, to the death, declare him for a Tyrant, and perpetual Enemy; and by eighty years Wars brought the Spaniard to an open confession or convicti∣on of his bad Politicks, for Force of Religion; and taught them, and the World too, if they will be taught, this Rule, <HI>That a free Nation must be governed freely.</HI></P>
<P>For the Pride and Tyranny, specially in Religion, and the unmerciful Inquisition, fill'd all Christian People, with Hate and Terror of the Spaniards; specially these most concern'd. For by no more powerful argument did the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> inflame the Netherlanders Spirits, than saying, That <HI>These burn men alive for Religion;</HI> which set them all on fire.</P>
<P>So ill does Force upon either mens Civil or Religious Li∣berties, conduce to establish Princes, where Subjects are once sensible of them.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="46"/>
And that Religion had a chief hand in these Revolutions, you must know that the main design then driven on by the Catholick Princes and Party, was the defence and propagation of that Religion, the Protector whereof the King of <HI>Spain</HI> vaunted to be, and the extirpation of Hereticks, and so to make the King of <HI>Spain</HI> Universal and absolute, and truly and indeed Catholick, (at least by some, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>In such sort, that about 1560, <HI>Charles the</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> king of <HI>France,</HI> with the Queen-Mother <HI>Katherine</HI> of <HI>Medices</HI> (a busie and Imperious Queen) and <HI>Isabel</HI> this king of <HI>Spains</HI> Wife, and the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> make a league, to joyne the Power and Poli∣cies of both Nations, to root out the new increasing Hereticks; The <HI>Hugonots</HI> out of <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Protestants</HI> out of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and immediately ensued the <HI>Ho∣ly League</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> (wherein this King was a mighty stickler also) and then those wars here.</P>
<P>So that he not only confederated with the <HI>Leaguists</HI> against the <HI>Hugonots;</HI> but also about the year 1580, (when the other would not do) endeavours also, upon the same account, to hinder the Reformation growing in his own Dominions, by bringing in the Inquisition and arbitrary Government amongst them, whereby he was wholly driven out of those Provinces, confederating together for their Liberty and Priviledges.</P>
<P><HI>And indeed, except mens Civil Liberties be first invaded, their Religious can hardly be.</HI></P>
<P>To recover which Countries, they exhausted all their strength in vain for eighty years, till they were at last forc'd to a shameful submission in the Treary of <HI>Munster</HI> 1648. therein renouncing for ever all Right, &amp;c. and treat with them and their Embassadors, as free and absolute Soveraign Estates.</P>
<P>For by this time they had other Bones, that touch'd them nearer, to pick, and a greater Enemy to deal with; and a worse and nearer Neighbour, which occasioned the defection of <HI>Por∣tugal</HI> and <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>

<P>Thus <HI>Spain</HI> that had the four chief parts of the World, <HI>Europe, Africa, Asia</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> and possest more Coun∣tries and People than all the ancient Monarchies put together, has been shrewdly and dangerously enfeebled in some of its principal Limbs, and never likely to recover its first strength.</P>
<P>'Tis observed from the Story, that this Kingdom got its great increase by Marriages, but lost alwayes by Arms. Three Marriages specially enlarg'd it▪ 1. Of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Em∣peror with the Heiress of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> whereby all the Nether∣lands, or <HI>Belgium,</HI> came to the House of <HI>Austria.</HI> 2.

<HEAD>Of the great Dukedom of <HI>Tuscany</HI> or <HI>Florence.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The grand Dukedom of <HI>Moscovy</HI> is now reckon'd an Em∣pire. The great Dukedom of <HI>Lituania</HI> is subject to <HI>Poland.</HI> The great Dukedom of <HI>Finland,</HI> to <HI>Swedeland.</HI> There re∣mains only one Soveraign Great Dukedom, and five Duke∣doms. As for the Dukedoms of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bavaria,</HI> they have the higher titles of Electorates.</P>
<P>The Great Dukedom of <HI>Tuscany</HI> was anciently a Free-State: but never any more turbulent with Factions, and several forms of Government in the State; and most commonly between the Nobles and Commons: till at last when there was no end of these Contentions, the People prevailed against the No∣bles.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="49"/>
Among the Commons, the <HI>Medices,</HI> princely Merchants, were chief Adversaries of the Nobles, and highly in favour with the People. So that about the year 1410 <HI>John de Medi∣ces</HI> maintaining their Liberty, was so advanced, that he not only got a great party; but almost a Soveraignty in the City.</P>
<P>About the year 1433, it began to be changed into a Mo∣narchy, or single person. By <HI>Cosmo</HI> his Son, called Father of the Country. The occasion was the faction of the Nobles against the <HI>Medice's,</HI> who by an unjust Judgement banish <HI>Cos∣mo;</HI> but recalled again the next year by the Commons, and constituted in a manner Prince of the whole Commonwealth, as the Father of his Country, saving stil the Liberty of the City.</P>
<P>His Son by the same moderation and favour of the people, (which yet continued,) obtained in like manner the principa∣lity, notwithstanding all the opposition of the Nobles; to sup∣press which, took up all his Son and successors time also.</P>
<P>At length, but too late, the people fearing to be made here∣ditary to this powerful Family, chose another eminent Person: But he knowing and considering the fickleness and unconstan∣cy of the Multitude, that new Houses as they are soon in, so as soon out of their favour, confers all his interest upon the <HI>Medi∣ce's</HI> again; as a potent Family that had long governed the Ci∣ty. Against whom another faction conspir'd; but without effect. And now they seek more firmly to establish themselves.</P>
<P>For about 1494. for clandestine transactions with the King of <HI>France,</HI> (come into <HI>Italy)</HI> without the Magistrates, they were ejected as Enemies of their Country, but restor'd again through the Popes means, by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> 1512.</P>
<P>But afterwards <HI>Rome</HI> being taken, and the Pope himself (who was of this Family) by <HI>Charles the fifth,</HI> Emperor, King of <HI>Spain, Naples,</HI> &amp;c. the Florentines recover their ancient Li∣berty again by the help of the <HI>French.</HI> The Pope to revenge this affront transacts a Peace and Accommodation with the

Emperor on this condition, that he should restore <HI>Florence</HI> to the <HI>Medices,</HI> which after two years Siege and resistance was recovered against the French, <HI>An.</HI> 1530. by the said <HI>Charles;</HI> who creates <HI>Alexander di Medices</HI> first Duke thereof; who built a Cittadel to aw the People. <HI>Catharine di Medices</HI> Queen of <HI>France</HI> was his sister.</P>
<P><HI>Cosmo</HI> his successor, 1537, extends the Dukedom far through <HI>Italy,</HI> and by his great wisedom and prowess sways the affairs of <HI>Italy;</HI> and 1569. was Crowned in the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the Pope, first King of <HI>Tuscany;</HI> but, the better to pacifie the Em∣peror, (who pretended it to be his right to create Kings and Dukes) it was turned into that of <HI>Great Duke</HI> only; adding thereby only the title of <HI>Great;</HI> and so has continued in this Family ever since.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Commonwealths; and first of the <HI>United-Provinces.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Tyranny of the Spanyard was the occasion of this Commonwealth, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>The end of which Tyranny was to suppress the growing Reformation of Religion, and by force to reduce them back to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> To which end <HI>Philip the</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> trans∣ported with Catholick Zeal, invades not only their Religious, but Civil Liberties: (without which little good was to be
<PB N="98" REF="52"/>
hoped for against their Religious) and by this twofold Tyran∣ny, endeavours absolute Dominion over them.</P>
<P>The Religious Tyranny was chiefly the Inquisition, and more Episcopal Sees and Courts. The Civil, was in many re∣spects: But their cheif Prerogative was, that if the Prince by violence or wrong, did infringe any of the said Charters and Franchises, the people after declaration thereof made, might go to election of a new Prince.</P>
<P>Ring <HI>Philip</HI> was so Zealous in the Cause of the Romish Church, that 'tis thought that his eldest Son, was put to death, with his consent, in the Inquisition House, for seeming favou∣rably inclined to the <HI>Low-Country-Hereticks,</HI> as the Spaniards called them.</P>
<P>At length when they could no longer endure the Spanish Tyranny, they begin to vindicate their Liberties and Privi∣ledges by Arms, under the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> about 1568. which lasted eighty years, till 1648. during which time, it be∣came the School of War for all great Captains and Warriours. The Ring of <HI>Suede, Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> is said to have exercised Incognito, as a common Souldier, under the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P>The first Province was <HI>Holland,</HI> about 1570. and others af∣terwards. <HI>An.</HI> 1579. A Confederation is first made at <HI>Utricht</HI> of perpetual Union and League by certain Laws and Conditions, against the Spanyard. And <HI>An.</HI> 1581. they declare by writing directed to all People, that <HI>Ppilip</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> was fallen from the Government; and take a new Oath, which bound them never to return to the Spanish obedience. But you must know first, that after intolerable persecutions of the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> (in such sort, that within fourty years an 100000 had been de∣stroy'd and more) the Nobility exhibited their humble peti∣tion, <HI>an.</HI> 1566. whereupon they were nicknam'd <HI>Beggars,</HI> which Title they accounted their Honour, and take the Arms of Beggars upon their Cloaths, with this Symbole, <HI>True to the King to the very Bag.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="52"/>
The same year the commom people <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se every where in Tumult, and with their Arms frequented Sermons in all places, and practising force against Churches and Temples, broke in pieces Statues and Images, &amp;c. And so the War be∣gan. And at length, as has been hinted, abjure all fidelity and obedience for ever solemnly to the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and re∣solve to die, and undergo any death, rather then yeeld; and never to have any Peace or Reconciliation, so long as he made the least pretence of Right to this Commonwealth; (which after eighty years, they forced him solemnly to renounce) and with so much Arder, Zeal, and Confidence, that they had ra∣ther all <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> should be sunk in the Sea under Water, then again submit to the power of the <HI>Spanyard.</HI> The <HI>Hugonots</HI> in <HI>France</HI> much about the same time, upon <HI>Henry the</HI> 4<HI>ths</HI> turning Catholick, took another course, and agreed upon Terms, which have been but ever since a breaking.</P>
<P>This done, according to their Rights and Priviledges, they go to elect a new Prince; and seeing the Spaniard too hard for them, they seek the protection of strangers, and had rather indure any Master then the Spanyard. First the Arch-Duke, the Emperors Brother. Then the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> Brother to <HI>Henry the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> Ring of <HI>France, An.</HI> 1582.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> being stabb'd at <HI>Delph</HI> by a Monck, <HI>An.</HI> 1584. they sue to <HI>Henry the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> who was too busie at Home with the holy League, &amp;c. to take care of strangers. And therefore 1588, seek to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as distressed States; and she of the same reformed Religion too. Who re∣fuses the Government: but sends relief, by an Army under the Earl of <HI>Leicester;</HI> with Cautionary Towns put into his Hands.</P>
<P>Hereupon growing prosperous, But jealous of the Earl, they resolve to govern and establish the Commonwealth a∣mong themselves, so that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> chuse Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and the <HI>Friezlanders</HI> Prince <HI>William,</HI> Earls of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> for Go∣vernours
<PB N="100" REF="53"/>
Captain Generals, by whose conduct and con∣quests, the seven Provinces were wholly vindicated from the Spaniard, and reduced into one intire Body of Common∣wealth, <HI>An.</HI> 1594. And afterwards so prospered and succeed∣ed, that before they would hearken to any treaty or accommo∣dation, they forc'd the Spaniard to this conclusion, to treat with them as a Free-State, in the year 1609. and then made a twelve years truce only. And 1621. renew the War again, but not so hot as at first, &amp;c. till the Treaty of <HI>Munster</HI> 1648. whereby the Spaniard renounces all pretensions for ever, and acknowledges them for a Free-State▪ &amp; only dependant on God. A War so shamefully begun, and (after fourscore years) so shamefully ended; in a Glorious and Eternal Peace made with them for ever.</P>
<P>Liberty of Religion, according to the Laws of their first Union at <HI>Utrecht</HI> 1579, was the foundation, and has been, and is, the preservation of this Commonwealth.</P>
<P>The Reformed Religion <HI>Protestant</HI> (or <HI>Calvins)</HI> was pub∣lickly established. The <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> or <HI>Mennonites</HI> and others, had their publick Temples or Congregations. Only <HI>Papists,</HI> (and <HI>Socinians</HI> since) for reason of State were forbid the pub∣lick exercise of Religion, to this Day; as disturbing the Peace.</P>
<P>Though the War was Civil, and for their Civil rights direct∣ly, (as knowing well they could not violate and invade their Religious, without violating and invading these first) yet the end, motive, and occasion principally was Religion, (and up∣on that account, and indirectly Religious) on both sides. Zeal for Religion on both sides, moved both to contend for their pretended civil rights and claims. And so 'twas not a War for Religion, but as they say, a Defensive War only, for their Civil Rights and Liberties, though in order, &amp; subservi∣ency to Religion. And yet there was at the same time more Pa∣pists, then Protestants (then called Lutherans at first) in these Countries.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="53"/>
They indulge Liberty of Religion, with which their State begins and stands. But Trade and Riches has almost eaten out Pure Religion.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Republick of the <HI>Switzers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>These Countries lie bordering upon <HI>Germany, Savoy,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon the fall of the Roman Empire, after various Fortunes and Masters, coming under the possession and power of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family, and Emperors thereof afterwards, and over∣burdened by the Tyranny of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Governors, and Lords sent amongst them, and their incroachments upon their Liberties, and so weary of them, and finding an opportunity, amidst the distractions of the Empire by the Pope, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swisse</HI> constitute a Confederate Republick, <HI>(i. e.</HI> con∣tract an offensive and defensive League amongst themselves, for desence of their Liberties) Begun 1305, but not finished till 1511. For when they did endeavour by force, to make them, of a free Nation of the Empire, the Austrian's own pro∣per Subjects, and to bring in Arbitrary Government, by force also they opposed.</P>
<P>First three Rusticks or chief Country men made a League amongst themselves of expelling Tyrants, whereof each brought his Town or Village into Society. The rest came by degrees afterward successively; til in the end after two hundred years from the first beginning of their League, to the finishing
<PB N="102" REF="54"/>
them, they amounted to the present number of thirteen <HI>Can∣tons,</HI> or distinct Parts and Corporations. Besides several other Towns &amp; States, without the bounds of their Commonwealth, also joyn'd and comparted together with them, for common defence and safety.</P>
<P>And becoming Invincible in innumerable Battels and Victories at the first, forreign Enemies durst never attempt them more. But since, frequent Civil Wars amongst them∣selves; but never to break their first Confederacy, but still friends again.</P>
<P>Their Confederacy and Liberty was confirmed and allowed afterwards by the Emperor, <HI>Lewis</HI> the fourth, of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> for adhering to him against the faction of <HI>Austria</HI> for the Empire at the same time.</P>
<P>After their forementioned Victories, and Valour shewn in those Battels &amp; Wars eminently, becoming renowned for Soul∣diers, the French King takes them into pension in his Wars, (who became likewise a member of their Corporation) which being afterward denied, they serve the Pope, who stiled them <HI>Defenders of the Church, An.</HI> 1510. The King of <HI>France</HI> thinks it best to take them again into pension, 1522. upon very ad∣vantagious terms to themselves, and as burdensome to him. They became Mercenary also to other Princes. Any might have them for their Mony. Hence reproached for a Mercenary Nation, trusted by none. But the King of <HI>France</HI> bid highest for them. And at this day they are in all Armies and Wars.</P>
<P>Since that agreement, they obtained also sixteen hundred to be of the French Gaurd; the King preferring them for their Fame and Renown. At last upon the differences of Religion, they became divided also in pension. The Popish Cantons taking pension of the Pope and King of <HI>Spain;</HI> the Prote∣stants of <HI>France;</HI> and the mixt of both; and all of the <HI>Venetians.</HI> There was not long since, some difficulties about their Pension and Agreements, &amp;c. They sent Embassadours to the present
<PB N="103" REF="54"/>
French King; who magnificently received them; and things composed, &amp;c. An Army consisting of <HI>Swisse</HI> Foot, and French Horse; is accounted of all the most excellent.</P>
<P>About 1516. <HI>Zuinglius,</HI> a Canon of the Church, begins the Reformation of Religion here at <HI>Zurich,</HI> as <HI>Luther</HI> had before with good success in <HI>Germany.</HI> Whom followed those of <HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>Basil,</HI> &amp;c. (to the number of four) in whole; and two other Cantons in part, which to this day remain mixt of both. Those of <HI>Lucern,</HI> and the rest, to the number of seven, remain wholly Papists. <HI>Geneva</HI> also soon after followed those of the Re∣formed, under <HI>Farel</HI> and <HI>Calvin.</HI></P>
<P>So that now this Common-wealth became divided into two factions, and thence broke out into cruel Wars, between <HI>Zu∣rich</HI> and the Romish <HI>Cantons.</HI> The Protestants at the begin∣ning are worsted. <HI>Zuinglius</HI> himself Slain in the head of the Battel, 1531; his heart remaining whole (like <HI>Cranmers)</HI> in the midst of the Fire, untouched, as is said, after all the rest consumed to Ashes.</P>
<P>At last after various successes and defeats on both sides, they agree the business upon this condition, That every one should imbrace what Religion they liked, and force be offer'd to none for Religion: but that the ancient first League should be in∣violably and religiously kept and observed. And so indulg∣ing each other the free exercise of their Religion, they break not League for that matter, nor ever have to this day, till late∣ly; notwithstanding any Civil Wars of Religion or State, that have since happened. Being it seems pretty equally poiz'd and ballanced on both sides.</P>
<P>But here it will not be amiss to note that these two, <HI>Zuinglius</HI> and <HI>Luther,</HI> went two several waies, specially in point of con∣substantiation, or real presence.</P>
<P>Hence the Protestants became divided in <HI>Germany</HI> into <HI>Lu∣therans</HI> and <HI>Zuinglians,</HI> afterwards called <HI>Reformed.</HI> And the Names of <HI>Ubiquitarians</HI> and <HI>Sacramentarians</HI> every where
<PB N="104" REF="55"/>
break forth, as has been hinted before, under <HI>Germany,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Calvin</HI> afterwards rising in the place and stead of <HI>Zuinglius</HI> at <HI>Geneva,</HI> added some Tenents about Predestination, Free∣will, Universall Grace, and Perseverance in Faith, which further heightened and aggravated the Differences betwixt them.</P>
<P>About these arose afterwards in <HI>Holland</HI> great contentions with the <HI>Arminians,</HI> which caused the General Synod at <HI>Dort</HI> against them, <HI>An.</HI> 1618. &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Germany.</HI> Between these two Religions of the Protestants arose grievous discords, not only Theological but Political. For that many would exclude the <HI>Calvinists</HI> or Reform'd, from the Peace of Religion agreed on at first by the Augustian Confession at <HI>Ausburgh,</HI> and banish them out of <HI>Ger∣many.</HI> Whence those violent Tumults of <HI>Ausburg</HI> in the As∣semblies, or Meetings of the States, against the Elector Palatine 1560. and again against the succeeding Palatine Elector, 1590. and of <HI>Lipsia</HI> and <HI>Brunswick,</HI> 1595. And this might be one reason perhaps of the Elector, the Duke of <HI>Saxony's</HI> siding at first with the Emperour against the <HI>Palatine,</HI> in the Bo∣hemian-German Wars, about the year 1619. the Palatine be∣ing head of the <HI>Calvinists</HI> or Reform'd, and then also the chief of the Electoral Princes▪ and the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> of the <HI>Lu∣therans.</HI> But afterwards fearing the Emperors prevailing and greatness, (who had ejected the Palatine) and the coming in thereupon of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> in defence of the German Princes Liberties, the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> convocates all the Pro∣testant Princes at <HI>Lipsia, an.</HI> 1630. where they concluded of a defensive League against the Emperor and Imperialists, and that Liberty was to be propagated and maintained by Arms. But after the King of <HI>Swedes</HI> death, &amp;c. he deserts them, and by himself alone injuriously agrees with the Emperor against the <HI>Swede</HI> and the rest, &amp;c. The conditions of which Peace others also accepted and agreed to; as before has been inti∣mated.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="55"/>
In the end at the conclusion of these Wars of <HI>Germany</HI> by <HI>Munster</HI> Treaty. 1648. This Political differance was reconcil∣ed, and they agreed and united into one common name of the <HI>Augustan</HI> Confession at first made, in the beginning of the Re∣formation, as aforesaid. The Theological differance ever since, both Princes and Divines at this day labour hard to com∣pose; and 'tis hoped that a bridle will be put upon the Tongues and Pens of the Pastors and Professors, that they do not condemn, but tolerate one another mutually, and friend∣lily dispute their controversies amongst themselves. In <HI>France</HI> they have of late proceeded so far, as to allow and embrace communion with them, and in their Churches and Sacraments; (if they will) which made the Friers and Jesuites write, that they might as well hold communion with them, and be recon∣ciled to the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> for that the <HI>Consubstantiarians</HI> was as far from the <HI>Sacramentarians,</HI> as the <HI>Transubstantiarions:</HI> but sufficiently answered. Yet the <HI>Swedes</HI> have this present year lately decreed and enacted by Law, for all to lose their na∣tive freedom, that shall bring up their children in any other Re∣ligion, then the Lutheran. But to return to the <HI>Switzers.</HI></P>
<P>This concord of Religion then made between them, lasted till 1654, when a new War kindled amongst them again, for Religion, and the Protestants cruelly Murthered and Slaugh∣ter'd. For when some Families of the Canton of <HI>Switzers,</HI> and other Cantons had embraced the Gospel, they cruelly put them to Death. This those of <HI>Zurick,</HI> and <HI>Berne</HI> would not suffer. After long contestation, at last they come to Arms; and fierce War begins betwen those of <HI>Zurick</HI> and <HI>Lucern,</HI> till at last the French King interposing (and <HI>England)</HI> this War was compo∣sed the same year; and the civil commotions for Religion be∣gun, presently ended; the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> likewise not only then, but since persecuted the <HI>Waldenses</HI> in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> as there has bin hinted, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1663. the Duke <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Newburg,</HI> by his edict
<PB N="106" REF="56"/>
commands all Protestant, Lutheran, or Reformed, out of his Dominions. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> by way of retortion, in like manner, commands all Papists out of his. This should have been noted there.</P>
<P>The last year upon Jealousies of the great preparations of the King of <HI>France,</HI> against some Neighbouring Countries of the Empire, and his thriving Greatness, this Commonwealth raise an Army of fifty thousand, which chiefly diverted him from his then intended designes.</P>
<P>The thirteen Cantons are <HI>Switz; Uren Underwald,</HI> first unit∣ed. 1305. <HI>Lucern</HI> added 1332. <HI>Zurich</HI> and two others, 1352. <HI>Bern,</HI> 1353. <HI>Friburg,</HI> and another, 1481. Another and <HI>Basil,</HI> 1581. and the two last, 1511. two hundred years from the first. Seven are Papist, as <HI>Switz, Lucern,</HI> &amp;c. four Protestant, as <HI>Zurich, Basil, Bern,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>(Bern</HI> is of all the largest and most po∣tent, &amp;c.) and two mixt of Both.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of Geneva.</HEAD>
<P>The Soveraignty of this City, or Commonwealth was anci∣ently in the Earls thereof at first Imperial Officers only: but at last the haereditary Princes thereof.</P>
<P>Between these and the Bishops, arose Controversies for the absolute Command. At last the Bishops (being under the Pope, Powerful in those dayes) obtained of the Emperor, to be sole Princes thereof; free from all Taxes, and not account∣able to any, but the Emperor. But to maintain it, they were fain to call in the Earl of <HI>Savoy</HI> then; who takes upon him, first as Protector of them only; but afterwards as Lord in chief. Whence his pretence to it still. And in this Sate it stood, till the year 1528. the Bishop being their immediate Lord, under him as supream.</P>
<P>But then Religion being altered in the Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> ad∣joyning by <HI>Zuinglius, &amp;c. Viret</HI> and <HI>Farellus,</HI> indeavour it in <HI>Geneva</HI> also. But the Bishop and Clergy oppossing it, by Per∣secution,
<PB N="107" REF="56"/>
Violence, and Tyranny, the People defend them∣selves, and their priviledges, and by force expel the Bishop, and his Clergy. And though the Bishop made many fair overtures, yet would they never harken to any accommodation, nor ever admit him again; and so changed the Government of the state also; disclaiming all allegiance both to Duke and Bishop; and standing on their own Liberty, as a free Commonwealth, like their Neighbour Canton, who had sped so well under theirs.</P>
<P><HI>Calvin</HI> afterwards, <HI>An,</HI> 1536. confirm'd them in these be∣ginnings, made them abjure the Pope, and never more to ad∣mite their Bishop, And then sets up his Ecclesiastick Disci∣pline, (called since Presbyterian, by the Form thereof by Presbyteries) and gets it ratified by the Senate, <HI>An.</HI> 1637. But the next year, with <HI>Farel,</HI> was bannished; but sued to return again, which he would not, except they would ob∣lige themselves solemnly to his Form of Discipline; which upon better Consideration, they condescended to, <HI>An.</HI> 1541. And so he returns, and his Discipline becoms established. The Tithes converted to the use of the State; for Pensions for Ministers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Afterwards comes <HI>Beza,</HI> and not only recommends it as convenient, but imposes it as necessary, and of divine right; therein going farther and higher then <HI>Calvin.</HI> And so by these two chiefly it spreads it self over all <HI>France,</HI> occasioning after∣wards those grievous and lamentable Commotions and Trou∣bles, before mentioned there, as it had done likewise by <HI>Lu∣ther</HI> in <HI>Germany.</HI> Which are not to be attributed to Religion, but the Lusts of men. For <HI>whence come Wars and Fightings, Amulation, Strife &amp;c. are they not from your Lusts?</HI></P>
<P>For the greater safety of their State, and preservation of their Religion, they joyn'd themselves in a constant and per∣petual League with the Canton of <HI>Bern. An.</HI> 1528. com∣municating to each other the freedom of their several Cities;
<PB N="108" REF="57"/>
and by that means reckon'd in some sort of Commonwealth of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> from the very beginning.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1589. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> besieg'd it; But they were assisted by neighbouring Princes, and <HI>States,</HI> &amp;c. so that he could do no good upon them.</P>
<P>Another time the Pope, French King, Spaniard, and Sa∣voyard had designs upon it; But the Emperor then offered assistance Yea, sometimes the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> has assisted them against others, rather than they should fall into any other hands then his own. <HI>An.</HI> 1602. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> attempts <HI>Geneva</HI> by arms.</P>
<P>The Duke has of later years often threatned, and made preparation against them, but without effect. The King of <HI>France</HI> never throughly enough favouring his design; or else quite against it, &amp;c. And so flourishes in Arts and Trade, more then Religion, which (as almost through all <HI>France)</HI> is become meerly formal; for which God is at this day purging, and fan∣ning them in <HI>France</HI> or else quite rooting them out. they have retain'd only the first form of Doctrine and Godliness; but not the power thereof; peremtorily and stifly rest in the first Reformation, and would never hearken of further progress, as the manner is of most Churches, that settle upon their old Lees once. Is it not seen even in <HI>New-England</HI> it self, as well as, &amp;c.? from the very self same spirit that drolls in the un∣lucky witty <HI>Hudibras;</HI> thinking strange, that <HI>Reformation should be alwayes doing, and never done.</HI></P>
<Q><L>As if Religion were intended,</L>
<L>For nothing else; but to be mended.</L></Q>
<P>From hence no doubt was it, and a firm perswasion of the Divine Right of <HI>Beza's</HI> Government, as if they had already at∣tained to the perfect form, that the French Synod at <HI>Carren∣ton,</HI> made a publick decree against the <HI>Independency of Chur∣ches, &amp;c. An.</HI> 1644. whereas that form only is to be imbrac'd and preferr'd which upon all emerging curcumstances, con∣duces

most to the present Power of Religion, and Godliness. For that is Reformation; and not Form or Forms, though never so pure otherwise; for that very thing makes them Impure. Except what is plainly manifest out of Scripture, and to abide for ever. But we intend a short History, not Dis∣pute, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice</HI></HEAD>
<P>The terrible noise of the <HI>Huns</HI> for the Conquest of <HI>Italy,</HI> and their expedition under <HI>Attila</HI> their King, occasioned many Noble and Principal Families with their several retinues, to betake themselves to these small Islands and inaccessible Mar∣shes of the <HI>Adriatick Sea;</HI> where they build for the time only, several habitations, <HI>An.</HI> 421. and finding themselves safe and impregnable began to build Towns, and Cities, or Corpora∣tions. <HI>An.</HI> 452. Till in the end, <HI>Aquileja</HI> and the neighbouring Cities being destroyed by <HI>Aquila,</HI> and these Barbarians, <HI>An.</HI> 456, they then fled from all parts like Exiles hither, with a purpose and resolution to settle; and so by the destruction of <HI>Aquileja</HI> takes such increase, that it assumed the just form of a Commonwealth. For whom soever the <HI>Hunnes, Goths,</HI> and <HI>Lombards</HI> (the Nations that harass'd <HI>Italy)</HI> drove from the Con∣tinent, they presently betake themselves to <HI>Venice,</HI> (now be∣gun to be so called, from the name of their Nation) as to an Haven of security.</P>
<P>They had first yearly Tribunes, according to the number of Islands into which their City was divided, for two hundred years. then succeeded Dukes, <HI>An.</HI> 697. but soon after chang∣ed into yearly Masters of the Militia, which lasted but Six years, and returns to Dukes again; whose power at first was greater; but afterwards restrained to be meerly Titular.</P>
<P>Under this form it thriv'd exceedingly, and became ex∣empted from all Jurisdiction, either to the East, or West Em∣pire,
<PB N="110" REF="58"/>
upon the division of <HI>Italy</HI> made by <HI>Charles</HI> the great, be∣twixt himself, the Popes and the Eastern Emperor, and left wholly as a free State acknowledging no superior. For <HI>Pepin</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> Father of <HI>Charles,</HI> had invaded them, with a puissant Army, but was beat.</P>
<P>They then extend their Empire far and near by Sea and Land, through <HI>Dalmatia, An.</HI> 990. and become freed from all Tribute to the Constantinopolitan Emperor of the East; from whom at length they obtained it, and <HI>Croatia</HI> in full right. Afterwards <HI>Corfu</HI> and <HI>Chius,</HI> Islands. And from that time cal∣led themselves Lords of all the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea; and that right confirmed by the Pope; <HI>An.</HI> 1177. for defending the Church stoutly against the Emperor. And from that time marry the Sea yearly with a Ring.</P>
<P>It got its greatest increase about <HI>An.</HI> 1204. by the chief Islands of the <HI>Mediterranean Sea, Candy</HI> and divers other Pla∣ces, And then spread it's Empire through the Continent of <HI>Italy,</HI> under pretext of freeing the Cities from Tyrants, and upon the distresses of their Neighbours for their assistance, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1207. The Genoese, a State grown powerful by Sea, contend with them for Soveraignty of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> by seven several Wars in order; vanquished their fleet, and brought them on their knees, in so much that the Senate sent them a blank Charter, and bid them write what conditions they pleased. And had utterly lost all if the Enemy could have used his fortune with moderation. But the <HI>Genoese</HI> Admiral grown proud of his advantage, and insolent with this great success would have the City wholly at his disposal: which made the City desperate, and venturing last Stakes, beat them, pursue them Home, and utterly crushed them for ever after. For after many various successes and events of War on both sides, they got, <HI>An.</HI> 1381. the better of them absolutely, &amp; made them quiet, never daring afterwards to contend in War, but apply themselvs wholly to Gain and Merchandize. Which
<PB N="111" REF="58"/>
misfortunes were occasioned principally by their own divisi∣ons, and endless factions, at Home, as shall be touched on afterwards.</P>
<P>Being now Lords Paramount at Sea, they increase amain by Land, (as even now hinted) through the factions and divisions of their Neighbouring States; whereby one piece or other is still added, either Sold or Morgaged, or given, for their assistance. And so became possessed of innumerable places belonging to the Empire, the Pope, <HI>Milan,</HI> and Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> working their greatness out of others ruines; which sordid kind of Merchandise drew all the Princes of these parts afterwards to make War upon them, every one to recover by strong hand, what they had extorted from them in their ne∣cessity.</P>
<P>Being therefore arrived to their greatest height and power, after mighty Tempest of War, they begin to decline from a∣bout the year, 1500. For now all Europe conspired to extin∣guish this Commonwealth: the Pope being chief Author. A League then is made between the Pope; Emperour, King of <HI>France,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> (wherein lesser Princes joyn'd) at <HI>Cambray</HI> in the Netherlands, <HI>An.</HI> 1508. So secret and private, that they were oppressed before they understood it; and so were whol∣ly almost overcome, and scarce had any thing left but their City; fell down at <HI>Caesar's</HI> feet, and cry Peccavi. By which submission they out-live this confederacy, to see it desolved; and thereupon easily recover again from each single, what they had lost to all; save <HI>Naples</HI> only. And have ever since thought it their wisest course not to conquer, but to keep; and to be∣come Mediators and Reconcilers, rather then Medlers, be∣tween differing Princes; And by privy Leagues, rather then open Wars do defend themselves against the Emperor, and House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>Their latest Enemies, and of this age have been the Pope, the Emperor, and above all the Turk. The Pope <HI>An.</HI> 1605.
<PB N="112" REF="59"/>
excommunicates the Commonwealth of <HI>Venice</HI> (1) Because they would exclude all Ecclesiasticks from Government (2) because they would pay no pension to the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and though good Catholicks, yet little cared for the Pope.</P>
<P>The occasion was the difference between the State and the Churchmen. The Pope defended the Churchmen: and the <HI>Venetians</HI> their Laws, and the right of Majesty. They arm against the Pope▪ the French and Spaniard stand lookers on; the French to quench, and the Spaniards to inflame the Fire. Only the Hollanders bring help to the State. And at last end∣ed the Popes ridiculous War, but with perpetuall Banishment of the Jesuites, for adhereing to the Pope, and would by no means be intreated to tolerate them in their Territories; till ten years since through necessities of the <HI>Turks</HI> Wars, and for favour of the late Pope, they were restored again, but on strict conditions, &amp;c. These Jesuites were once also expell'd out of <HI>France;</HI> for King-killing Documents, and practises: but soon cunningly worked themselves in again there.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1616, There was War between the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Austrians.</HI> But the <HI>Holanders</HI> helping them, Peace was soon made. The occasion was about some Rights in <HI>Istria</HI> and <HI>Friuli,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1645. The <HI>Turks</HI> invade <HI>Candy,</HI> and soon make them∣selves Masters of all; save the City of <HI>Candy</HI> it self; which they have maintained for above this twenty years, against all the Ottoman Power, to the amazement of the World.

<P>They were anciently a large and flourishing Common-wealth; getting their liberty out of the divisions of <HI>Italy,</HI> a∣mong several Lords and Masters: and were too potent for the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as before hinted: But through their own divisions and factions, at length loose almost all their estates, to Potent Neighbours, and enemies. The City being (miserably) torn in pieces by endless and perpetual factions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Berengarij,</HI> as Kings of <HI>Italy</HI> opposit to the Emperor, made them free, <HI>An.</HI> 899. And first under Governors till 1100. Then Consuls to 1194. then Mayors. And then added Governors of the People to them, &amp;c. with wonderful fluctu∣ation and inconstancy, through the multitude of factions, &amp;c. At last to alay the factions between the Nobles and Commons, a Duke was created by the people (for every two years,) of the Nobility, or the Commons, <HI>An.</HI> 1327.</P>
<P>Those factions were first between the <HI>Dorij</HI> and <HI>Spinoli,</HI> on one side, and the <HI>Flischi</HI> and <HI>Grimaldi</HI> on the other. About 1174. Next of the <HI>Negri</HI> and <HI>Mollani,</HI> against the <HI>Salvatici</HI> and <HI>Embriam,</HI> about 1289. and lastly frequently between the Nobles and Commons; which brought them to this foremen∣tioned Government.</P>
<P>Which factions did so weaken them at home and abroad,
<PB N="114" REF="60"/>
that they became of far less reputation and authority then an∣ciently. For this great City Commanded the Ocean, and all the affairs of <HI>Italy,</HI> in a manner once. And brought the <HI>Vene∣tians</HI> under, to their last gasp as it were, but through these di∣visions lost almost all their large Estates, and reduced to that narrow compass, they have now at present. For neither did their factions change or cease with their Governments.</P>
<P>This Government by Dukes continued (yet not without Parties still, as between the Spinoli and Dorij themselves, <HI>An.</HI> 1336. and the Nobility and Commons 1339. and the <HI>Guelfi</HI> and <HI>Gibellines,</HI> &amp;c.) till the <HI>French</HI> were called in by the <HI>Guel∣fian</HI> faction, About <HI>An.</HI> 1390. for they were so broken, that they were feign to put themselves under the protection of Neighbours, to defend that little they had left. And so they deliver themselves up to the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, <HI>An.</HI> 1403. they put themselves under the pro∣tection of the Dukes of <HI>Milan,</HI> which were sometimes under the obedience of the French, sometimes of the Spaniard.</P>
<P>But after many changes and alterations of this kind, they are at length restored to liberty from the Empire of the <HI>French,</HI> by <HI>Charles the fifth, An.</HI> 1522. and the New form of Government instituted by <HI>Andrea Dori, An.</HI> 1528. called therefore, Father of their Country; and Dukes are created eve∣ry two years by lot. This lasted till 1574.</P>
<P>When dissentions arose between the Nobles and Com∣mons, but composed by the Emperor, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Pope.</P>
<P>But not being able to preserve their freedom restored so to them; they finally put themselves under <HI>Spain,</HI> who be∣comes their Protector; and thereupon, all occasions of War borrows Mony of them upon use; by which, and by their Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> they have exceedingly thriven, &amp; grown excessive∣ly rich; contenting themselves only with Riches and Trade, without aiming at Dominion: And though far inferior to the

<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of the Papality, or Popedom, and Papal Kingdom.</HEAD>
<P>The Papal Power, and Principallity, is either Spiritual, or Universal Bishop, Infallible Judge of Truth, with universal power of Excommunication, that is, as supreame Head of the Catholick, or Universal Church: (at first founded upon Tem∣poral power and greatness, and upheald by it, as well as Spi∣ritual prerogatives, previledges, and power. Else he had ne∣ver been owned as Supreme Head, &amp;c.) Or secondly, Tem∣poral; and this is again founded upon the spiritual. So that 'tis a mixt dominion of spiritual and temporal power. As cheif or High-priest, and a King, or temporal Prince. Which he pre∣tends to, over all; but enjoynes but in very little part.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="61"/>
This Dominion and Kingdom thus mixt, is either imperfect, and limited▪ as what he hath in and over other Ringdoms, (the Clergy specially) Being Head of their Church in their King∣doms: or perfect, absolute and Sovereign▪ as any other Temporal Prince over their Subjects, as in the Estates and Lands of the Church in <HI>Italy,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The foundation, and likewise Superstructure of this Religi∣ous Principallity (consisting of such twofold power,) was first laid, and then built and perfected by the working of the My∣stery of Iniquity, gradually. Which to scent and hunt out, would require the History of all ages and places; and too long therefore for this short Table: Yet to represent it obvi∣ous at one view, we can but briefly take notice, and touch up∣on only the chief matters of fact, without excursion or com∣ments.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) There was first distinction of Clergy and Laity. (2.) distinction, degrees, and dignities of Clergy, for order and unity, to avoid schisme, and factions. (3.) These degrees, dignities, and distinctions of offices in the Church, suited and proportioned very much, to those in State, and those Indepen∣dent on the state, thereby setting up <HI>Imperium</HI> in <HI>Imperio,</HI> or a Government in Government. (4.) Contending for preemi∣nence, priority, precedency, &amp; supremacy in the several Chur∣ches and Governments. (5.) Lastly an universal supremacy, <HI>i. e.</HI> of one over all. First Spiritual, in Ecclesiastick affairs. Secondly Temporal, in Politick affairs; at least aimed at, en∣deavoured, and pretended, and in some measure usurped, and possessed.</P>
<P>The spiritual supremacy began by Pope <HI>Boniface,</HI> about <HI>An.</HI> 606. under the title of universal Bishop, to which several things conduced. (1.) First, Accommodating the Honours and Governments of the Church, to those of the present state, that is, of the Empire become Christians; and so mixing Spi∣ritual and Temporal power, and setting up Empire in Empire,
<PB N="118" REF="62"/>
under <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, turn'd Christian. For because, they must needs acknowledge, according to that famous max∣im amongst them, that the Church was in the Commonwealth, not the Commonwealth in the Church; Therefore upon that foundation, the Fathers in the Council of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> raised this superstructure, that the Honours in the Church should be ac∣commodated unto those in the State. From whence would easily follow, an Head of the Church, as well as of the Empire, at least as far as the Empire reach.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Constantine</HI> dividing the Empire into fourteen Di∣ocesses, each Diocess into Provinces, and each Province into Cities, and placing in every Diocess a Vicegerent, or Viceroy, in every Province, a President, and in every City, a Defendor, or Governor: the Church accordingly institute, for every Vicegerent, a Primate, or Patriarch, in the principal City of the Diocess; for every President, a Metropolitan, in the Metro∣polis of the Province; and for every Governor, a Bishop in every City, with permission of the superior Emperor; and then a Pope over all would follow of course naturally, for the Emperor himself, &amp;c. in the chief seat of the Empire.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There was suiting Temporal means Tythes, Revenues, Riches, proportional to the Honours, Dignities, Degrees and Offices of Government in the Church, by the said <HI>Constantine,</HI> which a Voice in the Air proclaimed to be a Pest sown in the Church.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Bishop of Rome remained as yet, at least account∣ed the most Orthodox, and their Religion, as in the heart and center of the Empire, seemed most to flourish. Hence (1.) frequent appeals to this Church as the truest and best. (2.) Thence assuming to be supream Judg &amp; interpretor, or mode∣rator of controversie, of Truth and Error, and to be vindica∣tors of the Canon or rule of Faith. (3.) Lastly to be the only infallible Judge and determiner, and as it were, Rulers or over∣rulers of the Cannons, and to sit in the Temple of God as God;
<PB N="119" REF="62"/>
and all to submit to the decision of the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> at least presiding in Council.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The Bishop of <HI>Romes</HI> Seat, was the Seat or metropolis of the Empire, thereby gaining great authority, power, and pri∣viledges, and no less fame, esteem, and repute over all the World, &amp;c. But we can but hint things here in brief.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) The Empire began soon to be divided into the Eastern and Western. Where upon the Eastern Bishops contend for precedency and supremacy upon the removal of the Seat of Empire to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the outward flourishing of that Church.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) At last upon the further breakings and weaknings of the Empire, he obtains of <HI>Phocas,</HI> killing the Emperor <HI>Mauri∣tius</HI> in a tumult of the Souldiers, the absolute supremacy, and Title of Universal Bishop, about 606. as aforesaid.</P>
<P>In these contentions for this spiritual supremacy, they pre∣tended for their Title, and claim the donation or delegation of Christ thereto, the Succession to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> the donation and Constitution of <HI>Constantine,</HI> the first Christian universal Empe∣ror, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Having got the Supremacy of the Church in spirituals, the same mystery of Iniquity works for Supremacy also in Tem∣porals, over all Emperors, Kings, and Princes, and as it were universal Monarchy. For from universal Bishop, clearly fol∣lows universal Excommunication, even of Emperors, Rings and Monarchs, afterwards practised. From Excommunicat∣ing, deposing. From deposing, disposing of Ringdoms. From disposing (to whom should he be more kind then himself) Usurping and possessing. So naturally one Wedge drives in and makes way for another; And having got in his head, casi∣ly wriggles in his whole Body, &amp;c. Besides the Church was to be preferred above the State, and the Head of the Church, above the Head of the State. And so the Spiritual Supremacy prepares and makes way for the Temporal▪ For there is no end
<PB N="120" REF="63"/>
of Pride, and Ambition, so long as any equall or superior; un∣less he be above all that is called God, like <HI>Lucifer,</HI> who would be above God himself, and all Government or subjection. But we must not insist.</P>
<P>As to this Temporal Power, Particulars of fact in brief lye thus; as well as we can observe things, as they fell out. Only first take notice the foundation of his spirituall Supremacy a little more particular, in the order of time.</P>
<P N="1">(1) By the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> in <HI>Constantines</HI> time, the four Patriarchs, of <HI>Rome,</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and of <HI>An∣tioch,</HI> were all equal. (2) about the year 410. the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> would pretend to be the first Patriarch; and to that end falsifies the Canon, and sends it to the Council of <HI>Carthage,</HI> where it was rejected as false. (3) The Imperial Seat being translated to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the Bishop thereof was made a fifth Patriarch in order, and not long after the second, the rest oppossing, &amp;c. in vain. (4) The Lombards overcoming <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> and the Pope not well pleased with the Emperor, &amp;c. The Bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> endeavours the Title of Universal Bi∣shope, and obtains it of <HI>Mauritius</HI> the Emperor, the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> to the utmost opposing, and exclaiming against it, as in∣tolerable Pride, and the signe of antichrist. And whether out of a good mind, or because he could not be uppermost him∣self, laments the corruptions of the Church and Clergy. For of the Priests, he complains, the World is full of them, and yet but few Labours in the Lords Harvest. We take upon us the office, but discharge it who list; And I think no dishonour to God can be shewed so great, as that which it tolerated in Priests. For they are come now to that pass, that they jear at him that lives humble, and continently, and takes better cour∣ses, then themselves, which <HI>Mantuan</HI> versifies on, to this pur∣pose,</P>
<LG>
<L>Poor Curats only keep Pope <HI>Gregory's</HI> Laws,</L>
<L>And fish in Rills, and Rivers surface sweep;</L>

<L>'Tis Prelats sink <HI>St. Peters</HI> larger Net,</L>
<L>And 'lone i'th deep, all sort of Fish do get.</L>
</LG>
<P>The said <HI>Gregory</HI> cryed out, <HI>O times, O manners! The world is all on fire with Wars; Christians are destroyed by Idolaters; Cities and Temples, by Barbarians; and yet Priests, as it were, insul∣ting over Calamities; usurp the names of vanity, and make osten∣tation of profane Titles to themselves;</HI> thereby taxing this arro∣gance of the Constantinopolitan Patriarch. (5) <HI>Phocas</HI> killing <HI>Mauritius,</HI> and invading the Empire, to oblige the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> to keep <HI>Italy</HI> the better in quiet and obedience; grants the dignitiy of Universal Bishop to <HI>Boniface</HI> requesting it, and decrees the Sea (or Seat) of <HI>Rome,</HI> to be the Head of all Chur∣ches. Which decrees <HI>Boniface</HI> publishes in a Synod of 62 Bishops, and obtains it, not without opposition and conten∣tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After these things, the Eastren or Greek Church broke off from the Latine or Roman. <HI>Italy</HI> by several Masters began to be quite pluck'd from the Empire, and <HI>Rome</HI> to come into the Popes power, and several Schisms and Heresies in the Church, and contentions and quarrels between Popes and Emperors thereupon, &amp;c. The Pope alienates the Romans, or people of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> from the Emperor, brings them to oppose him, amidst the troubles of <HI>Italy.</HI> And condemns Emperors of the East of Heresie, and at last excommunicates them. And out of the ruines of <HI>Italy,</HI> works his own greatness, and by his means, and through his occasion, a new Empire is set up in the West, by the <HI>Franks,</HI> under <HI>Charles</HI> the Great: and great Temporal Power, and Dominion, and Estates, accrew'd to the Church; and the Pope at length claims superiority above the Emperors themselves, &amp;c. As the following particulars will manifest.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="64"/>
After the Supremacy of the Pope thus established, the Greeke Church in the East seperates from the Roman; not only for Primacy, but other high points of Religion; as was now said.</P>
<P>About the year 710. arose the controversie about Images. And about 726. the Pope excommunicates the Emperor for his Edct against Images, who laughs at it, and excommuni∣cates him again for an Idolater; and forbids Revenues and Taxes to be paid in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Upon these differences <HI>Italy</HI> is torn from the Empire by di∣vers Usurpers, and <HI>Rome</HI> by the Pope, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 712. Lands and Teritories are first conferr'd on the Church by some new Conquerors, And soon after more. And at last, most he now possesses, by <HI>Pepin,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the Great.</P>
<P>For about this time, <HI>Charles Martel Maire</HI> of the Kings Palace, recovers <HI>France</HI> from the Infidel <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Saracens;</HI> which drew the heart of the French towards him, creating him Duke or Prince of <HI>France;</HI> and might have had the King∣dom too, if he had been so aspiring.</P>
<P><HI>Pepin</HI> his Son under colour of Election is made King; The lawful King having his Pole shaven, and feign to retire into a Monastery, the Pope approving these proceedings; and in∣vesting and confirming <HI>Pepin</HI> in the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>But the Pope being distressed in</HI> Italy, <HI>calls in</HI> Pepin <HI>there∣fore, whom he had so obliged, to defend him, and the Church, in this Stile,</HI> Peter the Apostle of Jesus Christ, to you the most Illustrious King <HI>Pepin,</HI> and to all Bishops, Abbots, &amp;c. I the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> whose Adopted Sons you are, admonish you, that you perfectly come, and defend this City, &amp;c. And doubt you not, but trust assuredly, that I my self, as if I stood before you, do thus exhort you, &amp;c. and that I, <HI>Peter,</HI> the Apostle of God, will at the last day yeeld you mutual kindness, and prepare you Tabernacles in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Upon this quarel of the Popes, <HI>Pepin</HI> and his Son <HI>Charls</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="64"/>
destroy the Kingdom of the <HI>Lombards</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and give large Territories to the Church. And these things made way, and gave occasion and opportunity, for <HI>Charles,</HI> upon his great con∣quests, to set up the <HI>German</HI> Empire of the West Franks. The Pope in requital confirms <HI>Pepin</HI> in the Ringdom of <HI>France,</HI> gives his Son <HI>Charls</HI> afterwards the Title of most christian King, and crowns him Emperor of the Romans, at <HI>Rome</HI> An. 800. From which he would pretend to be above Empe∣rors and Kings, and to be his right to Crown, confirm, and de∣pose them, if not dispose of their Kingdoms.</P>
<P>But <HI>Charls</HI> (at length) reassumes the ancient and original Imperial Dignity and Power, to Govern the Church, call Councils, and order Papal Elections, and confirm and invest them, &amp;c. against all begun usurpations and incroachments of the Pope; and aws <HI>Italy;</HI> And keeps the Pope still Sub∣ject; which Authority of the Empire was prety well upheld, during the Caroline Race.</P>
<P>The Pope in the mean while under pretext of the Christian Religion, and converting Infidels and the Nations, increases in Wealth, Power, and Authority over the World, Thunder∣ing out these Decrees of Holy Church; <HI>Out of the Church no Salvation. The Pope's the Successor of St.</HI> Peter, <HI>the visible Head of the Church, the Vicar of Christ on Earth. His right, as aforesaid to create, confirm, excommunicate, and depose Kings, and dispose Kingdoms for the cause of Religion, &amp;c. That they are He∣reticks that dissent from the Roman Church, the only true Catho∣lick Church; or are Enemies to it,</HI> &amp;c. Hereby the Consciences of the Nations, Princes, and People, converted to an outward christianity, are aw'd, and fill'd with Reverence, and Zeal for the Church; to convert, or root out Infidel Nations, &amp;c. and to do any Benefices, or Services for the Church; As the most acceptable Service to Christ, whom they began to acknow∣ledge, and Worship, as their God and Saviour.</P>
<P>Hence, almost all the Nations subject themselves to the
<PB N="124" REF="65"/>
Pope, as Head of the Church, yea and in Temporals also in a great measure, nay some to hold their Kingdoms of him, &amp;c. As if they could not any better way recompence Christs Vicar, for the benefit of their Eternal Salvation, then to submit them∣selvs, &amp; all theirs to his dispose. And this Opinion was brought about to prevail in the World, that they might redeem their sins by good deeds and charitable works and services, for the Church against it's enemies, &amp;c. Hence Riches, and Revenues of the Clergy, and Hosts and swarms of clergy men. Hence Churches, Temples, Abbies, Monastries without number, &amp;c. for the Redemtion of Souls. Hence Expeditions, Holy Wars, Leagues and undertakings for the Church. Hence Pardons, Indulgences, and devices for mony, &amp;c. 'Twould be endless to mention particulars, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Pope having thus erected his Throne in the Consci∣ences of men, &amp; strongly seated there, through Ignorance and blind Zeal and Devotion, begins to play Rex in the World.</P>
<P>Besides there being perpetual emulation of Princes, special∣ly in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> for Empire and Dominion, &amp;c. The Pope interests himself in one part, and the other for fear of ex∣communication, or force, becomes subject to him.</P>
<P>The Pope therefore now practises all wayes he can against the superiority of the Emperor, and from being any wayes sub∣ject to his Authority, or control and to undermine all Supre∣macy in Temporals, presuming that all power is given to him, both in Heaven and Earth, in the Church and State, &amp;c.</P>
<P>'Till in the end, they come not only to let the Emperors have nothing to do, in their Election, Confirmation, and Investiture; but also to have all in a manner themselves to do, in the Creation and Coronation of the Emperors.</P>
<P>Not long after the <HI>Caroline power</HI> and <HI>race</HI> declining, and that partly through the Popes practises, <HI>Italy</HI> is usurp'd by several Tyrants against the Emperor, and almost wholly broken from
<PB N="125" REF="65"/>
it; wherein the Popes have a finger, and make their own ad∣vantage upon these distractions of the Empire.</P>
<P>For <HI>An.</HI> 884. <HI>Adrian the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> denyes the Emperors Autho∣rity, necessary to the creating Popes; and about the year 900. the Empire is wholly and perfectly translated, from the <HI>French</HI> or Caroline race, to the <HI>Germans,</HI> by Pope <HI>Agapetus's</HI> plot∣ting.</P>
<P>And about the year 1000. as some write, <HI>Gregory the fifth,</HI> appoints Electors for choosing the Emperors, whereby they afterwards became weakned, and the Empire broken into factions and parties; and the Pope thereby to have the better opportunity to work his own ends; and to raise his greatness out of others ruines; striving now to be uppermost, not only in Church, but State too; and to be above even the Empe∣rors themselves.</P>
<P>For after this time open and down right Tyranny over the Emperors, begins to manifest it self. First <HI>Pope John,</HI> takes away all choise of Popes from the people, to the Clergy only, upon this plausible ground, <HI>That the People are to be taught, not followed.</HI> Next <HI>Clement the</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> about 1047. set up by the Em∣peror, against other Anti-Popes, by the Authority of a Sy∣nod, caused the Romans to renounce by oath, the right they claimed, in choosing Popes.</P>
<P>Then about 1050. <HI>Leo the</HI> 9<HI>th.</HI> invested by the Emperor is perswaded by <HI>Hildebrand</HI> to put off his pontificalibus or papal Robes, in his journey from <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Rome;</HI> to wave the Emperor, and have a new election from the Roman Clergy; and then made <HI>Hildebrand</HI> Cardinal, who manag'd all at his pleasure. After this <HI>Nicholas the</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> about 1060. takes away the election from the Roman Clergy; bringing it about to a Colledge of Cardinals also then instituted; that is, of <HI>Spiritu∣al Temporal,</HI> or <HI>Lincy-woollcy Princes</HI> like himself the Supreme Emperor, as it were; for the greater grandure and more magnificent authority of his <HI>Almighty Holiness;</HI> who was now
<PB N="126" REF="66"/>
almost got to the top of Empire, Supremacy, and Omnipoten∣cy. For it was decreed in Council, the Pope only to be chose by Cardinals, whose <HI>Wounderful Worships or Eminencies</HI> might lift him up one step higher, even as it were, into <HI>Heaven, to be God on Earth.</HI> For so some thought fitting afterwards, to stile forsooth his divine Majesty, &amp;c. And then they order <HI>that no lay Person should confer Ecclesiaslick Investiture.</HI> For what should the Church concern them? But yet they themselves would in∣vest and Crown <HI>Lay Princes.</HI> For though the State had no∣thing to do with the Church: yet the Church had to do with the State, in order to the good of the Church, necessarily. And therefore the Church must now comprehend the State; And as it was above it; so now must rule it for it's own good; as the less worthy, for the more worthy. And therefore the <HI>chief Churchman,</HI> must be both Supreme <HI>Bishop and Emperor, or high Priest and King.</HI> That is, the Vicar of Christ must be like his Master, and of the same Authority in the World, to whom all power was given, both in Heaven and in Earth; thus the Mystery of Iniquity wrought with all deceitfulness, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next year, or two after, <HI>Alexander the</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> is elected by the Cardinals only, without the Emperor; who complains of this as against his right. <HI>Hildebrand</HI> stoutly main∣tains it, That the Emperor had no right in the Election of Popes. <HI>Alexander</HI> inclining to yeeld to the Emperor, is sound∣ly box'd by <HI>Hildebrand,</HI> then imprisoned, and at length poy∣soned, to make way for this mighty man of mettal, this <HI>Univer∣sal Monarch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pope Hildebrand</HI> by name, who the first usurps the Power and Right, of <HI>Supreme</HI> and <HI>Universal Monarch;</HI> as <HI>Boniface</HI> had before of <HI>Supreme,</HI> and <HI>Universal Bishop:</HI> at least layes the foundation thereof, and endeavours it. Thus <HI>Hildebrand</HI> and <HI>Boniface</HI> notoriously founded the <HI>Popedom,</HI> or <HI>Kingdom of the Beast.</HI></P>
<P>For first <HI>An.</HI> 1073. he sets up himself without any election,
<PB N="127" REF="66"/>
either of Emperor, or Clergy; but the thing being disputed, and the Emperor striving to vindicate his right, He refers himself to the Emperor and Princes. The Emperor <HI>(Henry</HI> 4<HI>th)</HI> thereupon confirms him: but the Imperial Majesty was thereby debased and impair'd. For (2.) afterwards he sets himself might and main against him; And (3.) excommuni∣cates, and so deposes him; and sets up Competirors among the Princes and Electors, sending a Crown to <HI>Rodolph,</HI> or <HI>Ralph,</HI> with a verse upon it, to this sense▪</P>
<P>The Crown which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Rock.</NOTE><HI>Petra</HI> gave to <HI>Peter, Peter</HI> on <HI>Ralph,</HI> bestows in Meeter.</P>
<P><HI>(Petra</HI> from whence <HI>Petrus</HI> or <HI>Peter,</HI> signifying, <HI>The Rock,</HI> that is, <HI>Christ.)</HI> and makes him rebel against his Master: And likewise sets up a second after him, when he was foyl'd; and involves <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> in horrible confusions, and fracti∣ons; and <HI>Pope-like,</HI> pronounces <HI>Absolution</HI> thus, <HI>We do absolve from their Oath of Allegiance, all that are sworn to excommunicate Princes.</HI> So arrogating the power of deposing and making Emperors to himself, and confirming his usurpations, by a pack'd Council held at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>At last (4<HI>ly)</HI> the Emperor through these means and practises deserted by all, is fain to submit, and (to get off his excommu∣nication and be absolv'd,) forced to come suppliant (together with his Emperess, and young son, the Prince) before <HI>Hilde∣brand,</HI> barefooted and bare legged, in the cold of Winter, all ragged and torn, and with a pitious Countenance and in a la∣mentable posture, to knock at his Palace Gate, and with tears beg admission, &amp; there to wait three days fasting, till his <HI>High∣ness</HI> (now as well as his <HI>Holiness)</HI> with his Minion, <HI>Madam Mathilda,</HI> or as they called her <HI>St. Peters Daughter,</HI> (that left her own Husband to live with this <HI>Holy Father,</HI> and other Grandees, and Roman Courtiers) despisingly looking out of his window, i'th' mean while, could be at leasure. But at last on the 4<HI>th.</HI> day (having, it seems, done penance enough,) be∣ing
<PB N="128" REF="67"/>
admitted by her mediation, he imposes on him most intole∣rable conditions, and unworthy of the vilest Slave, and by Oaths, Curses, and horrible imprecations, obliges him never to receed from obedience to the Pope.</P>
<P><HI>These things so transacted, not only the like are practised by his Successors, to the Emperors following: (as the story will shew:) But not long after also, they likewise decreed it by their Canons, and Ecclesiastick, Pontificial Laws,</HI> viz. The Roman high-Priest, to be over all, not only in Spirituals; but also in Tem∣porals. All Kingdoms, and Empires, to depend on him; and to order and administer all, as judged convenient for the Church, &amp;c. <HI>That is, to be</HI> Supreme Head both of Church and Sate. <HI>And in one word</HI> Supreme Universal Monarch of the World.</P>
<P>So that now the Pope begins to take upon him as <HI>High Em∣peror,</HI> or <HI>King,</HI> that is above all Kings and Emperors, as well as <HI>High-Priest,</HI> and to <HI>play Rex</HI> indeed. At least laid the founda∣tion, or groundwork, and first beginnings of all that tremen∣dous and terrible Pontificial Power and Omnipotency, (namely in Church and State too,) afterwards, over all the World.</P>
<P>The Pope then is now become both <HI>Universal High-Priest</HI> and <HI>King;</HI> (For so their Canons, &amp; Canonists, would now about this time have him to be, <HI>viz. Supreme,</HI> nay, <HI>Only Monarch of the World, and Universal over all.</HI> For so <HI>Baronius,</HI> a cheif Author, contends at this time, <HI>That none on Earth ought to be called Mo∣narch but the Pope.)</HI> We shall have him <HI>God</HI> too by and by. And the same <HI>Baronius</HI> sticks not at that; but proclaims him, not only greater then Emperors and all Kings; but also calls him, <HI>Lord God.</HI> And the Canon saith no less, both for his <HI>Kingship and Godship too.</HI> But we must for brevity, pass by these things, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After these usurpations of <HI>Hildebrands,</HI> the succeeding Popes follow his practises towards the succeeding Emperors; and never leave excommunicating and deposing them, till ei∣ther
<PB N="129" REF="67"/>
by force, or fraud they brought them in a manner under their Girdle, and that at last, they durst no more come into <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> nor medle with the affairs thereof: but by their stirring up, or backing of parties, and factions were finally outed of all their Provinces and Estates there; and not only so, but in the end lost almost all their power, and authority in <HI>Germany</HI> too; as after we shall see.</P>
<P>The Princes and Nations also, after grievous Wars, Quar∣rels and Troubles, (caused partly by his and his Clergy's, and Zealous Religionists means,) being by degrees brought un∣der, and subdued, one after another, did by their consent also, at length approve those their Decrees, and Canons; and own him as Head; at least of the Church, to excommunicate, &amp;c. (&amp; consequently to depose from Government of the Christian-Flock, as Infidels and Enemies of the Church.) And so sub∣jected their Kingdoms, both People and Clergy, very much in temporals also; which they did, either for fear of the Cler∣gy, and superstitious people, who had a carnal and furious zeal for the Pope, as Christs Vicar; the Church, as out of which no Salvation; and that Religion, as most suited to the natural man, and the peoples humours and lusts and very ap∣prehensions of God, Religion, and the way of Salvation, &amp;c. or else through their own blind Devotion, and Religious Super∣stition; or at best pious Veneration of the Christian Religi∣on, Church, and chief Pastor and Priest thereof, at their first turning Christians; (which was for the most part but to an out∣ward christianity neither, &amp;c.) and in those times of gross dark∣ness, and ignorance of the inward Mystery thereof, &amp;c. All which things by the sequel of the story will more plainly ap∣pear.</P>
<P>And now being thus raised to an earthly power, they quite and clean forget the salvation of Souls, sanctity of Life, and the Commandements of God, Propagation of Religion, and chari∣ty towards men: And to raise▪ Arms, to make War against
<PB N="130" REF="68"/>
christians, to invent new devises for the getting of mony, to profane sacred things for their own ends; by fine tricks, fair and specious shews, and pretences, to get into the affections of Princes, and oblige them to them; by several arts and wayes to keep the people in ignorance and obedience, though with the reigning of all manner of vice; to get all the chief Prefer∣ments, Benefices and Revenues of the Church into their dis∣posal, and the whole Army, and interest of the Clergy, at their service and devotion, in these corrupt wayes, and for such like unworthy ends; to possess the Consciences of men with an opinion of their infallibility, and undoubted power, not only in <HI>Heaven and Earth,</HI> but also over <HI>Pur gatory and Hell; viz.</HI> to bind, and loose, to save or damn; and that for mony, and filthy lucres sake; And lastly to make the whole Gospel, and Christian Religion, a pretext only to get and increase Church. Power, Dominion and Riches, yea and with the Goods and Treasures of the Church to enrich their kindred, and base chil∣dren, and raise their families, &amp;c. I say these and such like things and practises, become their only study and work, and the great business of (that is of him, that would be accounted) <HI>the chief Shepherd and Bishop of Christian Souls,</HI> &amp;c. We will instance only in some of the most notorious particulars, and matters of fact, as they occur in time, by the usurping and incroaching Popes, following; from this <HI>Hildebrand, founder of the Pope∣dom,</HI> as hath been shewn▪ about▪ the year 1073.</P>
<P>Next about the year 1090. his successor <HI>Urban the</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> ex∣communicates the Emperor likewise and deposes the Antipope by him chosen; and thereby sets all christiendom in a com∣bustion, for these two Popes. Therefore in stead of <HI>Urban</HI> called <HI>Turban</HI> (or disturber) And then likewise by his Religionists and Clergy, stirs up, and inflames all christendom with a zeal, for that bloody <HI>Holy War</HI> for recovery of the <HI>Holy Land</HI> from the <HI>Saracens.</HI></P>
<P>Which War consisted of twelve expeditions, (and of many
<PB N="131" REF="68"/>
hundred thousands at a time for the space of above 200 years together, to the ruine of so many millions of Lives) with the Arms first of the <HI>Cross,</HI> and afterwards of <HI>a Globe</HI> too, upon their <HI>Habits,</HI> signifying <HI>that Christ crucified</HI> (And to be sure the Pope as his Vicar) ought to be Lord of the whole World.</P>
<P>To allay the quarrels of Christian Princes at home, <HI>this Cross is</HI> often preached up, with wounderous Zeal. So that the main Religion of the World, (the Rulers and People,) generally in those days, lay mostly in outward Christianity against Infidels▪ Turks, and Pagans; and inlarging of <HI>this Visible Church,</HI> as out of which no Salvation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But i'th mean while this exhausive War of Christendom, every way made for the Papal Interest: The Popes having thereby greater opportunities to work their own ends out of poor Christians misguided Zeal; and by weakning and divert∣ing the Princes, to strengthen and settle themselves: for during all this time most cruel and perpetual wars continued at home, between the Popes, and Emperors, for Imperial, and Papal power, and priviledges; the Pope: still usurping and domineering every day more and more.</P>
<P>About 1100. <HI>Paschal the</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> excommunicates the said▪ Em∣peror <HI>Henry the</HI> 4<HI>th▪</HI> also; sets his only son <HI>Henry the</HI> 5<HI>th▪</HI> against him, to persecute him to death▪ who by the Bishops is perswaded to perjury also against his own Father▪ whom the Pope caus'd, after he was dead, to lye likewise unburied, five years together. He denyed the right of investiture of Bishops to the Emperor and other Imperial priviledges. And then excommunicated the son, now as devoutly as he had done the Father. And entertained and upheld <HI>Anselme</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in rebellion against his Soveraign.</P>
<P>This <HI>Paschal</HI> also first of all, leaves off closing his letters with the year of the Emperor, and substitutes the year of his Popedom.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1120. <HI>Calixtus the</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> made <HI>Gregory</HI> (set up Antipope
<PB N="132" REF="69"/>
by the said <HI>Henry the</HI> 5<HI>th.) to ride through</HI> Rome <HI>upon a Camels back, with his face towards the Tail, and the tail in his hand for a bridle.</HI> To shew, no doubt, that he held up the <HI>Tail (Caesar)</HI> and not by the <HI>Head,</HI> (St. Peter) &amp;c. and then thrust him shaven into a Monastery.</P>
<P>About 1150. the Papal Canons &amp; Decretals are first hatch∣ed; which afterwards in process of time were brought into use, and set up and prevailed in the World and the Church, in opposition to the Civil and Imperial Law; and chiefly to advance the Pontificiall Omnipotency, as themselves phrase it. And this Canon Law or Divinity (not the Law of God,) be∣came in time almost the only divinity, and study of the Pre∣lats, and great Church men, who studied little else, then to gain and increase Church Power, and Treasure; to get all into their clutches, and to keep all people in slavery, and subjection to their Authority and Religion.</P>
<P>And for others there began to creep in a Scholastick Divini∣ty, and Philosiphy, out of the Fathers, and <HI>Aristotle</HI> together, not the Scripture: And this Philosiphic-divinity brought all confusion of Opinions, and learned Ignorance and Error into the world. And for the more piously inclined and devout, a practical Divinity of Monkish <HI>Legends,</HI> or pious Tales, and at best but devout stories of the Sanctimonious lives of Saints, &amp;c. all which still made for the Pope.</P>
<P>About 1160. <HI>Alexander the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> opposses the Emperor, <HI>Frederick</HI> the first and excommunicates him, thundering out curses, and raising War against him every where, and by the French Kings favour settles himself in the Popedom. The Emperor notwithstanding takes <HI>Rome,</HI> and drives the Pope to <HI>Venice</HI> for protection, and sends his Son, with an Army after him, whom they beat and took Prisoner neer <HI>Venice.</HI> The good Father therefore to preserve his Son, is forced to submit, and to prostrate himself before the Pope openly in the great Church at <HI>Venice,</HI> to kiss his feet. Where setting his foot on
<PB N="133" REF="69"/>
the Emperors neck, he impiously and imperiously was not asham'd to say, <HI>Thou shalt tread upon the Lyon, and the Adder, and the Dragon shalt thou trample under foot.</HI> And when the Emperor took the boldness to reply and say, <HI>I do it not to you, but to</HI> Peter; The proud Beast goes on, <HI>To</HI> Peter <HI>and to me too.</HI> And from this time forth, and for evermore forsooth, it must be an high favour to kiss his <HI>Toes,</HI> as much as other Princes hands. And all this is, <HI>Your most humble Servant of the Servant of God,</HI> (his Title once) <HI>come too.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Beggers, of all men, proudest are,</L>
<L>When once they got into the chair,</L></Q>
<P>This Pope likewise upheld <HI>Thomas a Becket,</HI> against his King, here in <HI>England;</HI> and made the King submit to the lash, for <HI>St. Thomas's</HI> death, (for his Holiness Sainted the Trai∣tor) and upon his submission granted to him and his heirs, <HI>The title of the Kings of England.</HI> (As if they never had it since the Conquest of right before.) Hence it is observed, sayes the Popish writers, <HI>That all Kings of</HI> England <HI>must acknowledg the Pope for their Landlord.</HI> And in like manner his predecessor <HI>Hadrian the</HI> 4<HI>th.</HI> about 1555. gave <HI>Ireland</HI> to the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> for a penny to be paid yearly out of every house; (as much as a shilling now.) But
<Q><L>As long as there's a <HI>Goose</HI> or <HI>Gander,</HI></L>
<L>We must remember <HI>Alexander.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>If it were but for this verse sake, which ends a coppy sent to him, by a Monkish Rimer, little better in the Latin.</P>
<P>About 1190. <HI>Celestine</HI> Crowns the Emperor with his foot, and then spurns it off again; with this saying, <HI>By me Kings reign.</HI> He set all Princes almost together by the ears, that <HI>Rome</HI> might gain with siding with one part, or the other, and making them friends again. And this was, and is a constant practise with them, and a principal matter, whereby they stand. For if one deserts them, another still upholds them, for their own interest which is mingled with the Papal, over all the World.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="70"/>
About 1200. <HI>Innocent</HI> the third raised <HI>the Otho's</HI> against <HI>Philip</HI> the Emperor, resolving, that he would uncrown him, or be un∣crown'd by him, because chose without his liking. And as soon as <HI>Otho</HI> himself was made Emperor, excommunicates him too▪ as also King <HI>John</HI> of <HI>England; Peter</HI> King of <HI>Aragon,</HI> and <HI>Raimund</HI> Earl of <HI>Tholoss.</HI> And decreed in a Council held at <HI>Rome,</HI> from thence forth the Pope to have the <HI>correction of all Christian Princes,</HI> and no Emperor to be acknowledged, all he had <HI>sworn obedience to him.</HI> In pursuance whereof deposes the said King <HI>John,</HI> and gives away his Kingdom to the French King; causes him to surrender his crown to his Le∣gate; interdicts him the Kingdom for six years together; and makes him stand to his mercy to have it again; and upon the restoring to make it Tributary, fining it, at the yearly rent of 8000. Marks; to be held of the Pope in fee-farme, And his usurpations were so great here in <HI>England,</HI> That the Nobles writ in their Letters to their Bishops, <HI>To such a Bishop, or such a Chapter, who had rather dye, then he ruined by the Romish Task-Masters.</HI> Likewise the said King of <HI>Aragon, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Sici∣ly,</HI> &amp;c. was forced also to subject his Kingdoms, as feudatory to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and to be held of the Pope.</P>
<P>And now also was brought up that Idol of <HI>Transubstantia∣tion, and adoration of the Host,</HI> to subject the people to a more divine Reverance, and external devotion, and deportment, towards their Holy things, and mysteries; (which is wonder∣ful to behold even to this very day) and to make their Reli∣gion and Priests more Venerable; at least this has been the efect thereof; What matter of Zeal, Fury, and Persecution this became afterwards, all storyes and ages ring of; as if it had been to deny God indeed, and Christ, and all Religion, to de∣ny this their <HI>Idol God;</HI> they had and have to this day so posses∣sed people with such a fond Imagination. God also giving them up to believe lyes, and to erre concerning the Faith, mistaking the Letter, for the Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="70"/>
Also that devise of Auricular confession was introduced about this time; which aws the people exceedingly likewise.</P>
<P>Moreover about the same time arose those deadly seuds, between the <HI>Papaline Guelphs</HI> and Imperial <HI>Gibelines,</HI> (or if you will <HI>Elfs and Goblins,</HI> so called as is thought from their terrible doings, &amp;c.) which destracted all <HI>Italy;</HI> and conti∣uned for many ages after; which factions were stirred up by the Pope and his Agents means and practises, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It was about the year 200. likewise, that <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> was excommunicated; and then it was said, <HI>In the year of the Reign of Christ, not of Philip.</HI></P>
<P>Also 1204. the Sea of <HI>Constantinople</HI> and the Greek Church and Emperor, became subject to the Roman, for above 30. years, through their projects, &amp;c. And about 1220. the East as well as Westren Emperor, was crowned at <HI>Rome</HI> by the Pope; no longer now as a Servant, you may now well think, but their Lord, and Superior; by what has been already re∣hearsed. For in this Popes time, some thought fitting to make this Embleme; There are two great lights. <HI>The Sun,</HI> that is, the <HI>Pope;</HI> and the <HI>Moon,</HI> that is the <HI>Emperor.</HI> Nay the high Papalists would have none to be truly Monarch, and Sove∣raign, that is absolute and Independent, on any other as Su∣preme, but the Pope, as before has been intimated.</P>
<P>About 1240. the twentieths of Ecclesiastick Revenues are obtained for the Pope. It came afterwards to the tenths, nay the fifths, and fourths too in some Kingdoms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>About 1245. <HI>Innocent the fourth</HI> excommunicates the Em∣peror <HI>Frederick,</HI> the fourth time (having been three times be∣fore by former Popes) though he had been his greatest friend; and deposes him, the King of <HI>France</HI> in vain interceeding; and sets up <HI>Anti-Cesaers,</HI> because <HI>his Highness</HI> forsooth, would not stope low enough <HI>to his Holiness;</HI> and in the end because he would not bring him enough under, got him poyson'd.</P>
<P>The four orders of the begging <HI>Fryars, viz.</HI> the <HI>Domini∣cans,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="71"/>
<HI>Franciscans, Carmelits,</HI> and <HI>Augustins,</HI> began to swarm un∣der him, as their great Patron; and by their voluntary humili∣ty, and external devotion to uphold this their exalted and tri∣umphant Church, and Religion.</P>
<P>This Pope demanded also the payment of the Twentieths, before granted, and afterwards of the Tenths of all Revenues and Profits of the Church, adding grievous threatnings, if they were not paid; and by his <HI>Legate</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> one fifth of all: Afterwards he perswaded the French King to make War against <HI>Henry the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and to make him either yeeld to all the Pope demanded, or to drive him out of his Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1255. The King of <HI>Lithuania</HI> being converted to Christianity is crowned by the Pope, and subjects his Kingdom to him. For if they would be Christians, they must all acknow∣ledge Christs Vicar, or else be Infidels still; for all other Christi∣anity now was almost fled the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1260. The Pope translates the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> which the King of <HI>Aragon</HI> had made feudatory to the Church, (as before &amp;c.) and which the former Pope also would have sould to <HI>Henry the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>France</HI> from the right owners; and bestows it on the French most bountifully.</P>
<P>And now was the Pope come to the hight of power, riches, and authority, and to have mighty interest in the World; and now all the Nations, worshiped the Beast. The Princes gene∣rally began to make appeals to the Roman Court; and the people were devoted to the Romish Laws, Customs, and Reli∣gion. The <HI>Pope</HI> had now the creating of Electors of the Em∣pire, almost as he listed; and consequently the Emperor, in a manner at his beck.</P>
<P>About 1270. <HI>Rodolph</HI> of <HI>Napsburg</HI> (or <HI>Ausburgh)</HI> the first of the Austrian House, was affraid to go to <HI>Rome</HI> to take his Crown, or to meddle with <HI>Italy;</HI> Because, as he said, <HI>The Fox, saw no safe return of his Predecessors, out of the Lions paws.</HI> And

to be quiet in <HI>Italy,</HI> he granted <HI>Romania,</HI> and <HI>Ravenna</HI> to the <HI>Pope. An.</HI> 1279.</P>
<P>About 1280. The Popes having rais'd and fomented a quar∣rel, between the King of <HI>France</HI> and the King of <HI>Aragon,</HI> for the Kingdom of <HI>Sicily,</HI> whence grew the Massacre of the French, called the <HI>Sicilian Vespers,</HI> (wherein upon the toll of a Bell, all sorts of French were cruelly butchered) Pope <HI>Martin the</HI> 4<HI>th.</HI> for this excommunicates, <HI>i. e.</HI> deposes <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Ara∣gon</HI> and the whole Kingdom. (Had they done it on the Popes behalf, 'tis like it had pass'd for a noble action, as many worse have done.) The King he contemn'd the excommunication; But the <HI>Sicilians;</HI> they, it seems, could not be quiet in their consciences, or rather in their Kingdom, for so bloudy a fact, without doing penance to the Pope, and comimg to ask par∣don of him; which their Embassadors did, by delivering their Supplication in this manner, saying three times, <HI>O▪ Lamb of God, that takest away, the sins of the World, have mercy upon us.</HI> And this was an expedient Salve, on both sides, to be quiet. They hitherto have plaid <HI>Rex,</HI> that is King; now it seems, they would act <HI>God on Earth</HI> too.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1283. The said Pope sent his Legate into <HI>Germany</HI> to gather Monies, &amp;c. and three or four years after requires one fourth of all Ecclesiastick Revenues of <HI>Germany,</HI> degrading a Bishop for deposing it; and also within a year more, requires it again. He also set a Vicar of the Empire over <HI>Italy:</HI> For now the Emperors durst come no more thither, nor no longer meddle with the affairs thereof; loosing almost all their right, power and possessions there.</P>

<HI>over the Chair; for it is above they ability;</HI> (He meant sure Honesty.) Whereupon he would not hold it, though the French King much perswaded him; and decreed, That the Pope might quit his place, and turn Hermet (and honest) again; which he did to that end; but was hindred, imprison∣ed and made away by the impostor, that had deceiv'd him, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boniface the</HI> 8<HI>th. who,</HI> the next year 1294. <HI>entered like a Fox; but raigned after like a Lion, and at last dyed wretchedly like a Dog.</HI> He exempts the Clergy, by his general Bull, or zeal, from all taxes and payments to temporal Princes. Which was complyed with by the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. He threw ashes into an Arch Bishops Eyes on Ashwensday, because he was a Gibelline, and took the Emperors part; excommunicated <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and gave away his Kingdom to the Em∣peror; and boasted, <HI>That all powers were subject to him.</HI> In∣stituted the first Jubilee of Triumph therefore; when in that great concourse of people (and to make it great indeed, every one that did repair to it, was to have a plenary remission of all his sins; What better invitation, could there be devised, be∣sides the fine sight to be seen) The Pope (carried in Procession in a Chair of state; wirh a Sumptuous Canopy born over his Head by Kings, or Nobles, for so he is in the year of Jubilee,) shewed himself openly, before them all, <HI>one day in the habit of a Pope, and the next, in the habit of an Emperor, and every day caus∣ed two Swords to be carried before him, in token, that all power Ec∣clesiastical and Civil, did belong unto him,</HI> Yet King <HI>Philip</HI> in contempt of his Bull of excommunication, gave the proud Fool his own, writing back thus, <HI>Let your mighty Foolship know, that we are subject to none in Temporals.</HI></P>
<P>And from this time forward the year of Jubilee has been us'd, as a constant Fair, as it were, for the trade of <HI>Indulgence;, Agnus Dei's, and other fine Sanctified knacks,</HI> That so the peo∣ple invited thereby, to come or send from all parts to <HI>Rome</HI> to spend their Mony, might not have nothing for it. This was a
<PB N="139" REF="72"/>
pretty step towards making pardons and indulgences directly sealable afterwards. And that it might not be so long a com∣ing, they not long after reduced it, from every hundredth to every fiftyeth, and at last to every twentyfifth year.</P>
<P>In his time about the year 1300. the forementioned facti∣ons of the <HI>Guelphs,</HI> and <HI>Gibellines,</HI> the one for the Pope, and the other for the Emperor, grew to their height, and have last∣ed all ages ever since, almost to ours more or less.</P>
<P>Not long after <HI>Clement the fifth</HI> removed the Sea from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Avignon</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where it continued seventy years. His inauguration was ennobled with the presence of several Kings and Princes; in which Pomp, he lost a Carbuncle out of his Hat, valued at a great rate. He rooted out the Knights Tem∣plars, as too good for his turn; excommunicated the <HI>Floren∣tines, Luccans,</HI> and <HI>Venetians. Whose Duke, he made come, and beg pardon, chain'd like a Dog, and fed under his Table.</HI> He ex∣communicated the Emperor of the East because he would not subject himself, and the Greeke Church to the Roman, nor suffer appeals to <HI>Rome,</HI> as his Father before him had done. And likewise durst, neither fearing God nor man, forgive presently the Monk that then poysoned the Emperor of the West in the Host, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They were now arived to their utmost height, and became so insolent and imperious, that they could be indured no lon∣ger. So that about this time there were several Meetings and Assemblyes of the Empire against their intolerable domineer∣ings.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1333. The Pope leaves at his death, a vast treasure of twenty milions of Crowns, which they had amassed thus to∣gether, by their extortions, and devises. For all things e're this time had been become saleable at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Now it was that the Emperors, wholly in a manner, de∣pended on the Popes will and pleasure; who assume right and Soveraignty over the Cities Subject to the Empire in <HI>Italy.</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="73"/>
And the Emperors give up, as it were, all their Power and Au∣thority, so long contested for, to the Popes. For <HI>Clement the</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI> after 1340. to diminish still more and more the Emperors Right and Authority, created Vicount Vicars to rule the Em∣pire. Yet the Emperor again in requital, instituted other Vi∣cars to governe the Church. This and other things so netled him, that he would never be reconciled with the Emperor, except he put himself, and all his, into his Holiness disposal. Which for quietness sake, and to prevent the shedding of Christian bloud, the Emperor doth: The Princes of the Em∣pire exclaim against the Popes tyrannical usurpations. The Arch-Bishop of <HI>Mentz</HI> is depos'd for but speaking on the Fm∣perors behalf: and the other Electors, partly brib'd, and part∣ly awed, agree to set up his Son. <HI>Thus the Empire went down, and the Popedom up.</HI> And then cozens the world with his year of Jubilee, reduced to every fifth, and the fine trick of Indul∣gences, to please the people, and drive a gainful trade to the Popes. He gave away the <HI>Canaries</HI> also to King <HI>Lewis.</HI> And <HI>fifty thousand persons had accesse to his presence, in one day, and dismissed again.</HI></P>
<P>About 1352. The Emperor, to gain Pope <HI>Innocent the</HI> 6<HI>th</HI>'s favour, grants him in a manner all his Authority in <HI>Germany;</HI> and three years after is crowned at <HI>Rome,</HI> by the hand of the Popes Legate; (himself residing still at <HI>Avignon)</HI> promising not to stay one day longer at <HI>Rome,</HI> (now the Pope was absent) then after his Coronation.</P>
<P>About 1380. <HI>Clement the</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI> is set up anti-Pope, by a com∣pany of French Cardinals against <HI>Urbane the</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI> for being a∣gainst returning to <HI>Avignon.</HI> The French and Spaniard side with <HI>Clement:</HI> the <HI>Italians, English, Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. with <HI>Urbane. Rome</HI> is miserably plundered by <HI>Clement,</HI> and his party. One Popes Bulls roared against the others. And all Christendom divided. This schisme lasted neer fifty years.</P>

<P>About 1417. Upon the appearance of <HI>Wicklif, Hus Jerom of Prague, Savanarola,</HI> &amp;c. in the world and their followers, it is decreed in Council, <HI>That a Council was above the Pope.</HI> And 1431. The Council of <HI>Basil,</HI> summon the Pope, and put forth a bold Sanction, called therefore <HI>the Pragmatical Sanction,</HI> against him, and depose him</P>
<P>About 1464. <HI>Paul the</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> sells all for mony. Reduces the Jubilee to every twentyfifth year to get the more, to maintain Sumtuous and Pompous Habits for himself and Cardinals; and Diamonds, Saphirs, Emeralds, Jaspers, Pearls, and all pre∣cious Stones, for his Mitre, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1492. The Pope gives the East and West Indies to the Spaniard, and the Portugal, and divides the whole, (new world at least,) betwixt them, as the first discovers; and not long before gave the title of Catholick King to <HI>Spain,</HI> for the conquest of the Infidel <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1503. <HI>Julius the</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> A Martial Pope, passing over the Bridge of <HI>Tyber,</HI> brandish'd his Sword, and threw his Keys in∣to the River, saying, <HI>That if Peters Keys would not serve his turn, Pauls Sword should.</HI> And yet they have done more in the world by the Keys, then ever by the Sword. He excommuni∣cated the King of <HI>France,</HI> who regarded it not; but printed Money with this Inscription, <HI>I will destroy Babylon.</HI> He was in the end deposed likewise by a Council in <HI>France,</HI> like as the Council of <HI>Basil</HI> had done before, to one of his predecessors, as was hinted.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1512. <HI>Leo the</HI> 10<HI>th.</HI> an Atheist, hug'd and bless'd him∣self, as it were, to think <HI>What great Riches, that fable of Christ had got them.</HI> And yet not enough for his turn, and to supply his vile and enormous extravagancies.

ous they are still. <HI>By the fulness of power, which he that raigns above, hath given to me, whom alone he hath set over all Nations and Kingdoms, to pull up and pluck down, to destroy,</HI> &amp;c. (The Devil began to rage now, to see his Kingdom go down so;) <HI>We depose</HI> Elizabeth <HI>from the right of her Kingdoms; and we ab∣solve all her Subjects, from all manner of Oaths of Allegience, which they have sworn unto her.</HI> He doth all he can likewise by Trea∣sons, Murthers, and Poysons against her, and all Princes in∣clinable, or but favourable to the Reformation. His instructi∣ons by his Legate, to the Emperor was, <HI>Neither Faith, nor Oaths to be kept with Hereticks,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1572. <HI>Gregory the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> celebrated the horrible Massacre of <HI>Paris,</HI> with publick Triumph at <HI>Rome:</HI> and sung the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> &amp;c. therefore. For they had hopes to have quite root∣ed out the Protestants.</P>
<P>After 1580. <HI>Sixtus the</HI> 5<HI>th.</HI> excommunicates <HI>Henry the</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> for killing the <HI>Guises;</HI> and making use of the Pro∣testants on his side. Commends the Murthering of him in a set speech, amidst his Cardinals; Blesses the Banner of <HI>Spain</HI> against <HI>England</HI> in the famous expedition, in eighty eight, <HI>to ill purpose.</HI> For his Benediction proved a Curse. Quarrelled af∣terwards with <HI>Spain</HI> for <HI>Naples,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>About 1590. <HI>Gregory the</HI> 4<HI>th.</HI> exhausted the Treasury of the Church in the Wars of <HI>France,</HI> against <HI>Henry the</HI> 4<HI>th.</HI> and the <HI>Hugonots.</HI> Cursed, that is, Excommunicated that King for an Heretick and Apostate from the Church; and sent his Ne∣phew General to the French Wars, against the Protestants.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1592. <HI>Clement the</HI> 8<HI>th.</HI> never lets the said King to enjoy quietly his Kingdom, 'till he brought him to turn Catholick again, to be settled therein; But yet lost his life notwithstand∣ing by the Jesuits practises, for not being good enough to them, and too good to the Protestants still. For because he was not turned such a zealous Papist, as to be absolved from his excommunication by the Pope; but that one of his own
<PB N="149" REF="74"/>
Bishops served his turn well enough; therefore he must pass for a Tyrant, and be stab'd: And yet to absolve him after he was dead, (when be sure he could do no more harm, nor ever turn again) for turning Catholick in his life, <HI>Two Embassadors must be sent to</HI> Rome, <HI>to be whipt by the Pope in his stead, who at the end of every verse of the eleventh Psalm, gently strikes with his Rod, the prostrated Suppliants.</HI> He excommunicated-likewise the Duke of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and added his Dukedom to <HI>St. Peters</HI> Patrimony, as a good parcel of Land. And would not grant the title of King, to the great Duke of <HI>Moscovy</HI> for inclin∣ing to the Greeke Church, more then theirs. And lastly en∣deavoured before hand to prevent King <HI>James</HI> succession to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> hoping to reduce it again to the Church, as they had done before Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1595. <HI>Leo the</HI> 11<HI>th.</HI> had this Luciferian Motto over his <HI>triumphal Pageant, Worthy is the Lion</HI> (his name) <HI>by virtne of the Lamb, to take the Book, and open the Seals thereof.</HI> They cannot leave their Pride and Blasphemy, 'till they are quite whipt out of Gods Temple, where they sit as Gods. Nay yet more.</P>
<P>His successor <HI>Paul the</HI> 5<HI>th.</HI> had such inscriptions, as these, given him. <HI>To Paul the</HI> 5<HI>th. Vice-God. Most Invincible Mon∣arch of the Christian Commonwealth, and most Zealous Conservator of Papal Omnipotency.</HI> And caused this Plate to be marked with this Inscription, <HI>Cousecrated to the Eternity of the Burgesian Fa∣mily.</HI> But higher was that upon the Gates of <HI>Tolentum</HI> in <HI>Italy, To</HI> Paul the third <HI>the most high and mighty God on Earth;</HI> though one should have thought, that the Reformation then begun in the World, out of policy should have taught them, more Mo∣desty. For the Devil when ill at ease, a Monk would be, &amp;c. Surely Lucifer, that fell from Heaven (asspiring to be above, God, as the Pope, all that is called God,) was the first Pope in Heaven, and the Father of these his Sons on Earth.</P>
<P>About 1605. He excommunicated the Venetians, for main∣taining stoutly their Rights of state, and withstanding his in∣croachings;
<PB N="150" REF="75"/>
whereupon War insued; <HI>Baronias</HI> exhorting the Pope thus, <HI>Arise and Eate the Venetians;</HI> as if it had been as easie, as to eate his dinner. But he found them a tough Mor∣sel, which he could not get down; and so was held to hard meat. But a Cardinal of <HI>France</HI> made up the business as well as he could; but could not without enough dishonour to his Popeship. He by briefs, or writings, (sent to the Loyal Catho∣licks, of <HI>England,)</HI> forbad the Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>James</HI> from his own Subjects. He laid a great Tax also on the Clergy in <HI>Italy,</HI> to uphold <HI>the good old Catholick cause,</HI> in the Wars of <HI>Germany,</HI> about 1618. and a new Order of Knight∣hood was erected at <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Imperial Court, for all <HI>Heroick</HI> Catholicks, under the Patronage of the blessed Virgin, <HI>St. Michael,</HI> and <HI>St. Francis,</HI> to root out the Hereticks. But all would not do. For they <HI>increased and multiplyed.</HI> The Powder plot in <HI>England</HI> was also in the beginning of his Popedom, set on foot by the Jesuits, and their complices, in <HI>England.

<P><HI>An.</HI> 1621. <HI>Gregory the</HI> 5<HI>th.</HI> elected by way of adoration; instigates the French King against the Protestants. <HI>Canonizes Ignatius,</HI> the founder of a company of <HI>Incendiaries,</HI> that is Je∣suits (for so they have proved ever since.) <HI>Baptized with not the Holy Ghost, but with Fire;</HI> answerable both <HI>to his Name, and Motto,</HI> and <HI>their Natures.</HI> Quarrels with the Venetians, for entertaining <HI>Greeks,</HI> now they had no wars with Infidels, the Turks. To whom the Venetians wisely replyed, <HI>That they held all Infidels that opposed their Commonwealth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1623. Twenty four of the Cardinals grew sick upon the quarrelsome and ambitions choise of <HI>Urban the</HI> 8<HI>th.</HI> whereof ten lost their lives, with divers of others. Father <HI>Paul</HI> a vene∣rable Religious Monk, who stood up high for his Venetians, against the Jesuits, who pragmatically stood up for their Pope, (for which they were deservedly banished by the State;) not till now smarts, and is wounded for his crime of Loyalty to
<PB N="151" REF="75"/>
them, and petty treason as it were against the Jesuits; &amp;c. this Pope made War against the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> and <HI>Florence,</HI> for the Dukedom of <HI>Castro,</HI> &amp;c. And no doubt he had an under∣hand, or little finger at least, in the bloudy Massacre of <HI>Ireland</HI> 1641. by the Catholicks.</P>
<P>Afterwards <HI>Innocent the</HI> 10<HI>th.</HI> pronounces void, and goes about by his Legate to null the Peace of <HI>Germany</HI> made at <HI>Munster</HI> 1648 between the Protestant and the Papal princes, (where the Protestants, both Calvinists as well as Lutherans, were esserted into full and free liberty of their Religion;) as hurtful and dangerous to the Church forsooth. But <HI>Germany</HI> no longer now fears their loud Bulls roarings and bellowings as formerly; and do but laugh at such the vanity of <HI>his Omni∣potent Impotency.</HI></P>
<P>After 1654. <HI>Alexander the</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI> determines new Articles of Faith against the <HI>Jansenist's,</HI> and condemnes them for Here∣ticks. The Church of <HI>France</HI> begin to vindicate their Liberty against such new decrees, and power of the Pope, It grows to a great faction between them and the Jesuits. The Pope and his Instruments, make the King look upon them as a dange∣rous Sect, and as it were a new kind of <HI>Calvinistical Papists,</HI> that would both joyn against the true French Catholicks, and en∣danger <HI>France,</HI> both Church and State, as much as formerly those <HI>Hugonots.</HI> But they increased notwithstanding, and seve∣ral Bishops, Clergy men, and others adhered to them against the Novel Usurpations and determinations of the Pope, who would feign have been accounted infallible in his Court and pack'd Consistory at <HI>Rome,</HI> without a general Council. And fowl work had like to have ensued; but that the King and Pope together, have lately within this year or two, devised an expedient latitude, for the dissenting Bishops and Leaders; least the rent should be made greater, willing to make use of any Salvo for such a Sore, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1662. The Popes Guards, (by his Brothers design
<PB N="152" REF="76"/>
against the interest of <HI>France)</HI> assaults the French Embassador; which was connived at by the Pope, and his Brother, (who set it on foot) countenanced, and due Justice evaded. The King demands satisfaction; prepars a great Army to enter <HI>Italy,</HI> (whereof some had in a manner begun to enter.) which made the Pope tremble; and the French sing hartily, <HI>Rome is ours already</HI> &amp;c. yea the grand Ball at Court (since become a com∣mon Tune or Air too in <HI>England)</HI> began thus,</P>
<LG>
<L>Great King will you profane</L>
<L>Your Rapier in vain,</L>
<L>Your young brave Conquering Blades,</L>
<L>'Gainst Chaplains only with Beads, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>But his Holiness wisely submits, and drives on a Treaty for Satisfaction and Accommodation, and thereby condescended to set up at <HI>Rome a Piller of Remembrance,</HI> as it were, for the Injury, and Affront offered. Upon which submission, the King of <HI>France</HI> recieves his Embassadour through all his King∣dom, with extraordinary Magnificence, and ever since has been very kind to his Holy Father; and lately out of com∣plement granted the present Pope leave, to take down this too lasting a Monument of their reproach: but all no doubt for further ends to himself, which he is driving on in the world, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And while the King was thus good to the Church. The Pope takes that opportunity, to see if he could get to be own∣ed, as infallible in <HI>France,</HI> and supreme Judge and determiner of Controversies, and differences of Opinions in Religion; finding by woful experience, they should never have that pro∣perty of a <HI>Vice-God, Omnipotency</HI> in the, World, before they had thisof <HI>Infallibility.</HI> This was towards, and in the year 1666. by <HI>Alexander</HI> the late Pope. But that year has not proved so
<PB N="153" REF="76"/>
kind and lucky to their projects, as they looked for. Nor could they fool <HI>France</HI> into such a premunire.</P>
<P>This Pope has had little to do yet, but patch up the <HI>Janseni∣an</HI> Breaches, to avoid further mischief; (as but now hinted.) To mediate between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> as much as he could; and to invite Princes against a less worse Enemy to Christen∣dom, than himself, the Turk; who never did it half so much harm; nor ever will. Yet the Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> deserve Suc∣cour, and the <HI>Pope destruction.</HI></P>
<P>Yet so it is that the Kings, Princes, Clergy, and People of the Earth, have so drunk of, and been intoxicated with the Cup of <HI>Romes</HI> Fornications, that notwithstanding all the evill they have suffered by her Domineering and Tyrannizing over them, their Kingdoms, Subjects and People, both Soul and Body; as by the foregoing story may in part appear; yet they love to commit folly and abomination with her still; and her fine and goodly Religion, so carnal, so pleasing and sutable to flesh and bloud. But in the end, sure God will put it into their hearts (when he shall once have opened their Eyes, to see what miseries and mischiefs, she has brought upon all Kingdoms and Nations, and the whole World too, at least occasionally, or even but to see their own interests and concerns) <HI>to hate the Whore and burn her with fire.</HI></P>

<PB N="154" REF="77"/>
or a General draught of the hellish Hierarchy of <HI>Rome,</HI> or Popedom <HI>of King and Priest Lucifer on Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The pretended grouuds and foundations of their Popedom, Spiritual, have been already hinted before. Those for their Temporal are much of the same nature,</HI> viz. That the Pope is Christ s, that is God's Vicar, or Vice-Gerent; and so not only Vice-Roy, <HI>as it were,</HI> but Vice-God on Earth, <HI>which title they dare own;</HI> That He's Visible Head of the Church, and so of the State too, in order to the Church. For that the Church is above the State; The Head of the Church above the Head of the State. The State for the Church, not the Church for the State; and therefore dominion to be founded in Grace, &amp;c. And so no Enemies of the Church, Infi∣dels, or Hereticks to be capable thereof; but to be destroyed, and rooted out, &amp;c. <HI>(which are, all they shall judge so.) Likewise many Rights, Priviledges, and Favours granted by</HI> Constantine <HI>the Great,</HI> Charls <HI>the Great, and other Emperors and Kings. As also usurped and long permitted, or connived at Customs, Examples, Presidents,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But in one word, an outward Carnal Religion in the Letter without the Spirit; The form of Godliness without the Power. Christians both Pastors Preachers and People, first not having the Spirit, nor the wisedom from above, namely the wisedom of God, and the Power of God; but the wisedom of man, or that which is worse, the wisedom from beneath, earthly, sen∣sual, and devillish. Hence Ceremonies without substance; ex∣ternal and carnal Ordinances, Commandements, and Inventi∣ons of men, in the Worship and Service of God; Love of the World, and things of the World; Pride, Ambition, Covetous∣ness, and Voluptuousness; and Preaching, and professing Religion for such ends; and taking all up from tradition, au∣thority, and forefathers, &amp;c. Whence contentions and divisi∣ons about needless Opinions and Ceremonies; for Dignity, Superiority, and Supremacy; for Riches and Honours, &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd then a pompous, gaudy, and merry Religion, to please
<PB N="155" REF="77"/>
the people, and gratifie the outward man; to maintain and uphold the greatness, power, pomp, and pleasures of the Cler∣gy; through the secret and mysterious working of Iniquity, in men of corrupt minds, and erring concerning the Faith, and the Truth; which was after godliness, &amp;c. with some frightful devices to scare and awe their guilty, fearful, and slavish Con∣sciences; and other petty ones again to pacifie, and allay them; mistaking the whole <HI>Mystery of Godliness,</HI> and inverting it into a <HI>Mystery of Iniquity,</HI> one degree of Error and Corruption bringing in another; I say all this; <HI>is the foundation and Su∣perstructure of this Kingdom of darkness and of Hell.</HI> For the natural man perceiveth not the things of God, and of the <HI>King∣dom of God.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Popes Temporal Principality, and Soveraigne Estate in <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> (and <HI>Avignon,)</HI> called the Estate or Land of the Church, and <HI>St. Peters</HI> Patrimony; The founda∣tion thereof as a peculiar and distinct Soveraignty apart; be∣sides the forementioned grounds of the donation of Christ to <HI>St. Peter,</HI> (and his Successors) as his Sea, &amp;c. it depends over and above, on the forged and counterfeit donation of <HI>Constan∣tine;</HI> on the real donation of <HI>Pepin</HI> and <HI>Charls</HI> the Great, &amp;c. on the Countess <HI>Mathilda's</HI> last Will and Testament. (All which gave liberally to <HI>St. Peter;)</HI> and lastly on Usurpation, Arms, and Violence.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding it's convenient situation for the com∣mand of all <HI>Italy,</HI> and the perpetual fractions there formerly; yet they could never so wisely manage their Pope-craft as yet to possess themselves, like the ancient Romans, of the whole; which remains divided among many Princes and Soveraign Estates. <HI>As the Estate of ancient Lombardy,</HI> (under which is con∣tained <HI>the Dukedom of Milan</HI> subject to <HI>Spain, the Dukedom of Mantua, Modena, Montferrat;</HI> and the <HI>Principality of Piemont,</HI> which belongs to <HI>Savoy) The great Dukedom of</HI> Tuscany <HI>or</HI> Flo∣rence. <HI>The Lands or Estate of the Church, or the Popes Patrimo∣ny.</HI>

<P><HI>An.</HI> 1595. The Pope chalenged the Dukedom of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> for want of lawful Issue in the right of the Church, and partly by force, partly by composition, united it for ever to the Sea of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An.</HI> 1626. The great Dukedom of <HI>Urbin</HI> foremerly made fudatory to the Church, and held thereof in homage for want of Heirs, of right fell to the Pope, &amp;c.</P>
<P>About 1647. The Pope seized on the Dukedom of <HI>Castro,</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> upon the account of feudatory Quit∣rent, due to the Popes, whence arose War. But the Contro∣troversie was composed by the authority of the King of <HI>France,</HI> in their late treaty, 1664. when agreed, that <HI>Castro</HI> should be re∣stored to <HI>Parma,</HI> and the Duke to pay the mony due, &amp;c.

<P>And thus we have in general represented the foundations and Revolutions of the Papal Hierarchy, or Kingdom of the Pope; both Temporal and Spiritual; its rise, growth, increase height and decrease; not being able well to comprehend so long and mysterious an History, and so confused with all others in less room, and willing only to touch upon chief particulars of their usurpations, incroachings, and domineerings, down to our times, that so you might have a Map or Table, and plain veiw, as it were at once, of this Ecclesiastical and Priestly King∣dom. All which 'twas necessary to fetch so high, the better to understand the coherence of the story and present State thereof, with the Affairs and Revolutions (both of the Govern∣ments, and Religions) of all Christendom; which it has so wretchedly involved it self with.</P>
<P>The sum of all, in short is this.</P>
<P><HI>The Popedom was, a digging, working, and preparing,</HI> as it

were, <HI>underground, about</HI> 400. <HI>years most eminently from Victor, about the year</HI> 192. <HI>and others,</HI> (especially afterwards from un∣der <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great about the year 300.) <HI>to Boniface the</HI> 3<HI>d. About the year</HI> 600. <HI>As Covetous, Proud, Corrupt, Opinio∣nated, and in one word Apostate, Luciferian Bishops, Pastors, and Priests;</HI> that had fell from their first standing, and foundation of the Apostles, that is, the primitive purity and simplicity of the Gospel, to devised Fables, Ceremonies, Inventions, Con∣stitutions, and Prudentials, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Popedom Spiritual, or Universal Hierarchy, was founded by <HI>Boniface,</HI> as Universal Bishop, and high Priest. And from him to <HI>Hildebrand,</HI> for about <HI>400.</HI> years more. <HI>Hence the Titles of Divine Celestial Majesty.</HI> The Popedom Temporal, was founded by <HI>Hildebrand,</HI> as Universal Monarch. <HI>Hence from both</HI> Inno∣cent the <HI>8</HI>th. <HI>is stilled,</HI> one above all Principalities and Powers, and every name that is named in this or the other World.</P>
<P><HI>And the</HI> Height and flourishing of both, under <HI>Alexander the 3d.</HI> and <HI>Boniface the 8th.</HI> who boasted that all powers were become subject to him, &amp;c. to the dawning of the Reformation, by <HI>Wicklif,</HI> &amp;c. another four hundred years, the Brightnes whereof has been ever since, by degrees, a consuming it. <HI>And if we may</HI> guess, by the Stars, <HI>the last great</HI> Conjunction of the two Superior Planets in the fiery Trigon in <HI>1663. (which never happened before since</HI> Charls <HI>the Great's time 800. years agoe) they bode no good predicti∣ons, for the Popedom; but look as if they</HI> would burn up <HI>(Alsted sayes)</HI> all the dross and dregs of <HI>Rome,</HI> more then the fire of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> was ever like to do, as they accounted of the Protestants. <HI>But we must not think that</HI> Rome <HI>is only in</HI> Rome, <HI>though there she sits as a Queen, seing no sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>During the first 400. years they contended for preeminence, priviledges, dominion, and riches to maintain it; and began to Lord it over, and incroach upon other Churches, as the best. the most orthodox, and most Apostolick; as the chiefest, and most flourishing and Imperial Church.</P>

For Pope <HI>Victor</HI> about the year 192. excommunicated the Eastern Bishops, for not keeping Easter the same day with him; concerning which point the West (or Roman) Church after∣wards prevailed, under <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, by the Council of <HI>Nice;</HI> the Eastern standing for the tradition of <HI>St. John,</HI> and <HI>Philip;</HI> the Western for that of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards they induced <HI>Constantine</HI> upon his Infant con∣version, as the first Christian Emperor, to be good to the Church which had so suffered under the Heathen Emperors; and to make it great, glorious, and flourishing in the world; and peace setled in the Church; together with Dignities, Do∣minions, and Preferments, (in a politick and prudential way namely to avoid Heresies, Schismes, and Factions of Opini∣ons, &amp;c.) they began now to Lord it over one another, and over Gods Heritage, which they had not opportunity to do before, under persecution; nor sufficiently to shew the rot∣tenness of their Religion at the heart.</P>
<P>They brought <HI>Constantine</HI> to decree, <HI>Tithes to be paid of all things to all Churches;</HI> At which time was heard this voice in the air, <HI>now is poyson poured into the Church;</HI> which refers to the pride of the Bishops and Clergy, which these riches occa∣sioned afterwards. For <HI>Hormisda</HI> was so malpert upon't, about the year 500. as to excommunicate the Emperor, be∣cause he stood upon't <HI>That it was the Emperors part to command, and not be subject to Bishops.</HI></P>
<P>During the next 400. years, they contended with the Ea∣stern Bishops and Patriarchs of <HI>Constantinople</HI> for Universal Su∣premacy, devising divers sad stories and complaints; and in∣croached more and more upon the Emperors, and civil matters of State; and became as well Troublers of the Empire, as of the Church.</P>
<P>For the other four hundred, they contended with the Em∣perors themselves, for Universal Monarchy; (or Supremacy in Church and State;) iuterwove Temporal Jurisdiction with
<PB N="159" REF="82"/>
Spiritual, and at last withdrew themselves from all subjection to the Emperors, and brought them indeed under their feet; usurping and inlarging power and dominion to themselves, out of others ruines, &amp;c. as by the forgoing story may partly appear.</P>
<P>But this last (neer) 300. years, they have <HI>swelled only with Titles, and big words,</HI> and roared a little with their <HI>cursed Bulls with short Horns. And thus Pride begat Prelats, Prelats Patri∣archs, Patriarchs Popes,</HI> (answerable to worldly Empire, and Dignities,) <HI>and Popes would be Kings and Emperors, and not only so, but Gods too; but indeed and in truth very Devils.</HI> For Pope <HI>Sixtus,</HI> they say, gave his soul to the Devil for seven years Popedom. Such a sweet proud Tyranny it is.</P>
<P>And now this long lived Popedom, is come to its old age, and drawing towards its end, <HI>and from</HI> 666, <HI>plainly lyes a dying;</HI> against which year it strove, as it were, for life again, once more, in <HI>England, Ireland, Holand, France, Poland, Suitzerland, Piemont,</HI> &amp;c. with struglings in the world afresh, are to be rec∣koned, but as <HI>lightenings before death;</HI> Unto which, if it fill up the 100. current, or more, 'twill but be answerable to such tough, <HI>and lasting heart of Oak,</HI> too great to be rooted up in one generation.</P>
<P>In a word four hundred years, or more, a rising, as we may say; four hundred a growing, and increasing; and four hun∣dred more a flourishing in it's height; and towards three hun∣dred a decreasing. So that least of all, of any Kingdom, can it be said of this, <HI>Few though evill, have the dayes of the years of the Popedom been;</HI> Taking evil for wicked and mischievous, or doing evil, &amp;c.

<HEAD>Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>Thus have we seen in this last and worst age of the World, all Christendom all on a flame of Wars and Confusions like <HI>Wildfire</HI> every where, catching from Country to Country, and then taking its course round. Neither has any Nation escap∣ed scot-free from Stupendous Revolutions both Ecclesiastick and Civil.</P>
<P>We have seen within the compass of a few years, above a thirty years bloudy War in <HI>Germany,</HI> almost laying it desolate, which divided it self into several Streams, as first the Wars of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> then of <HI>Denmark,</HI> then of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> of the <HI>French,</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and of <HI>Italy</HI> too, &amp;c. Above a four∣score years War in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> with all the cruelties imaginable, and at last the most mighty Monarch of Christen∣dom outed of his own dominions by his Subjects and forc'd to acknowledg them a free State by a publick Treaty at <HI>Munster.</HI> 1648. A twenty years War between the two most mighty Mo∣narchs and Sons of the Church; with the Revolt of <HI>Catalonia;</HI> A threescore years Usurpation of the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal</HI> from the right Heirs, brought to nought in a day, and without bloud; but neer a thirty years effusion of bloud and Treasure ensuing thereupon; yet at last that great Monarchy forced to consent to the lopping off this so Principal a member from its body, by a late Peace. 1667. above a twenty years Wars of the hugeous Grand Turk against Christendom.</P>
<P>We have seen a lamentable twenty years Civil Wars in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> &amp;c. The whole Subversion both of Church and State. A Glorious King brought before the Tribunal of his own Re∣bellious Subjects, and unmercifully put to death by a faction of Republicans; An ancient, and flourishing Monarchy laps'd into a short liv'd Commonwealth, A State, A Protector, and a
<PB N="161" REF="83"/>
Miraculous return to where they began, an unheard of Restitu∣tion of the Banished and wonderful preserved Prince, without War or Bloud-shed.</P>
<P>We have seen the mightiest Emperor, deposed and strang∣led by his own Vassals, in the same year, 1648. and his Suc∣cessor much a-doe to escape the Rout in 1656. (that made sixteen Bashaws, one <HI>Vizier,</HI> forcing the Emperess and the High Priest, (almost equal with the Emperor himself) to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> &amp;c.) And the Brother of a King to depose his Prince, under pretence of Loyalty and the publick good, keep him in durance, (Rule in his stead) and make the Father and High Priest of the Church give his Queen to him for wife; and all the Princes of Christendom▪ even their late Master of <HI>Spain</HI> too himself by their Embassies and for their own Interests, to approve in a manner all; and to Complement the new Prince Regent from all parts.</P>
<P>We have seen also above twenty years civil Wars, Broyls, Commotions and Factions in <HI>Poland;</HI> and the poor old King made weary of his Scepter by his own restless and unconstant Subjects.</P>
<P>We have seen him, and a Queen besides, to lay down their Crowns of their own accord, for a more quiet and happy life.</P>
<P>We have seen a Universal Calme as it were, and Peace for a while; but a sudden Eruption of fierce Wars again, both by Sea, and Land; and again, a present deep Silence, and stand as it were, of a sudden, and the World gazing on one another, what they are about to do▪ &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lastly we have seen Grand Eclipses, Conjunctions, Comets and new Stars, Innumerable Prodigies, and Signs in the Hea∣vens, in the Earth, in the Waters, a raging Plague marching from Country to Country together with raging Wars, and <HI>the most dreadful Fire,</HI> that ever was designed or contrived, of one of the greatest and most flourishing Cities in Christendom. And behold greater things yet to come! <HI>ch.</HI> following, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<PB N="162" REF="84"/>
<HEAD>An additional Observation, concer∣ning the late Popes designes.</HEAD>
<P>There has already been hinted his new Negotiation with the Kings of the Earth to establish the <HI>Papal Sea's Infalibility▪</HI> He had a great zeal besides in rapairing the <HI>Church of St. Peter Paul,</HI> and to erect there a <HI>new Apostolick Chair.</HI> And would have imposed this Inscription thereon (although hindred by the wiser Cardinals) <HI>In the year of the Apostolick Authority re∣stored, the first.</HI> He spent likewise all the time of his Priestdom, in adorning <HI>Rome</HI> with new Palaces and Basilicon's▪ especially in raising a Palace designed for the future choice of Popes, cal∣led the <HI>Conclave,</HI> into a stupendons Grandure. To Erect which, that there might not want room, he commanded many Streets of the City with Temples and Monasteries to be demo∣lished; and sent for all sorts of Artificers out of <HI>Italy;</HI> as if, like <HI>Nebuchadnezer</HI> he meant to say. <HI>This is Babilon the Great which I have built, for an house of my Kingdom, and for the Glory of my Majesty,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now we should pass to the Foundations and Revoluti∣ons of the present Religion of Christendom; but that they would swell this Table (of the general heads of things only) in∣to a volumn; already too larg; And for that they may be also somewhat apprehended, from <HI>this general View, of the Revolu∣tions of States and Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Behold the desolutions of the Earth;</L>
<L>For want of the King of Peace to rule!</L></Q>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="163" REF="84"/>
<HEAD>The Pretensions and Interest of Europe.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The pretensions of Europe</HI> are either of one part, to another, as of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France; Spain</HI> to <HI>Portugal,</HI> &amp;c. of which 'twill be needless to speak a word: or else to other parts of the World, as to <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> or <HI>America.</HI> Of which a word or two. These pretences are founded on wrong and false titles; as Right of discovery, or of Christianity and Religion; and the Popes donation and disposal of the whole Infidel world accordingly thereupon.</P>
<P>For towards the year 1500. Pope <HI>Alexander the 6th.</HI> as if he was Master of the whole Earth, distributed, by his Bull, all the new World between <HI>Ferdinand the 5th.</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal.</HI> Here was a wonderful donation in∣deed, of the World from East to West, parted between two Princes.</P>
<P>And to make them agree, it was accorded, that the Portu∣guess should equally share from the fortunate Islands, or <HI>Cana∣ries,</HI> by one streight line from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> for the first Me∣ridian, an hundred and eighty degrees (that is, one half of the World) Eastward; and the Spaniard, as many Westward; And that both one and the other, should have right to take possession of all the Earth they could seize on; and all upon this title forsooth, That they should convert the Infidels, and Barbarous Nations to the Christian Faith; which they did in∣deed more like Infidels and Barbarians then Christians. So mankind preys one upon another, like ravenous Beasts and Birds of prey; Neither can the Protestans perhaps much re∣proach the Papists upon this account; and both will alwayes agree in this point, <HI>that glory and gain, are not to be neglected, what ever becoms of Christianity or humanity it self.</HI></P>
<P>But when the <HI>Portuguese</HI> through ignorance and impu∣dence,
<PB N="164" REF="85"/>
judged that they had wrong done them, (as yet igno∣rant that the World was round, or might be sail'd round,) by great importunity, they extorted, that the first Meridian, should be removed from the <HI>Canary Islands,</HI> to the <HI>Azores,</HI> three hun∣dred miles more Westward. Hence the first Meridian ever since, has place not in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> but the <HI>Azores</HI> Islands. the cause of which mutation, is not the declination of the Margent, and variation of the Needle, or Compass: but this division between the <HI>Portuguess</HI> and <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>Now by this change, it happened that the Portugals after∣wards obtained <HI>Brasil</HI> in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> which fell within the Meridian of the <HI>Azores:</HI> but the Spaniards reaped a far greater advantage; because they from that time chalenge right to the greatest part of the <HI>East Indies, viz.</HI> the <HI>Philippy Islands,</HI> (which they have to this day, to the <HI>Molucco's,</HI> and others, &amp;c. then out of dispute the <HI>Portugals.</HI> And this made the <HI>Spaniard</HI> al∣wayes retire and adhere to the <HI>Azores</HI> for the first Meridian.</P>
<P><HI>As for the Interests of Europe,</HI> in these sad dis-unions, revolu∣tions, and confusions of Christendom; <HI>The Interests</HI> of the whole and of every part seems mainly to be, to agree in Reli∣gion, and known Articles of Faith; and not devour one ano∣ther, as Infidels and Pagans, for Opinions or Ceremonies; and exclude not only one another their Church; but their Na∣tion and the World too, for Hereticks; or if not agreement; at least <HI>Freedom, and liberty of Religion;</HI> which is no <HI>unpracti∣cable Romance</HI> we see also for Christian Princes to unite, not so much against the Turk, as with one another; and not destroy and ruine one anothers Kingdoms, and so many Subjects lives, in unnatural unchristian Wars, and quarrels; and lastly each Nation to accord and conspire together into mutual corres∣pondence and free intercourse, in all their most excellent and useful things, of Nature, Art and Religion.</P>
<P>That so true Religion Learning▪ Arts, Sciences, Commerce, and Traffick, and all things else for the Common weale of
<PB N="165" REF="85"/>
mankind, may flourish, and be advanced <HI>in the World; that Mercy and Truth may meet together, Righteousness and Peace may kiss each other, on the Earth; which they have so long for saken.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>VVE should now finish this Table, but that we think it meet to add a second Chapter of the Prophetick
<PB N="166" REF="86"/>
History of Europe; not from the uncertain conjectures of Astrologians and Politicians, but Revelations truly accounted Divine.</P>
<P>If it more immediately concern all to know the present State of Christendom, and of this last age above all before, that are past and gone, and almost forgotten; yet that is principally in order to what is to come: And so much more it concerns us to consider what shall be hereafter, then the things that have been, and are.</P>
<P>And indeed this all mens minds generally are most inquist∣tive after, yet few will have faith to believe. And hence the knowledge of things to come, is one part of History, as well as of those that are past. Wherefore I shall think it no unac∣ceptable service to my Country men, and not unbefitting this place, to represent to view a summary draught also of those wonderful Visions and Revelations of <HI>Dabricius,</HI> by the Godly and Learned esteemed Divine; at least that few yet dare say are meer phanatick delusions, or diabolical; that so this Historical Table or Representation of things last past, and next to come; may be for more profit and advantage, and of greater use, to the English Reader.</P>
<P>'Tis certain all the world expects some great Catastrophe and Revolutions at hand, and great have lately past in all Nati∣ons, preparatory thereunto. All Astrologers gaze for it; All Politicians presage it, all Theologers divine it; And generally All People, Jews, Turks, Christians, Papists and Protestants, seem to bespeak as much. As if some dark intelligence were hovering up and down, to abode and whisper some such mat∣ter presently to betide the world. The Jews stand gazing for the Kingdom of their Messias; the Turks, of their Mahomet; The Christians of their Christ, and the Papists of their Anti∣christ.</P>
<P>The Planetary Conjunction, and new Stars, the dreadful Comets, and terrifying Prodigies. The remarkable predicti∣ons,
<PB N="167" REF="86"/>
and prophetick Spirits, yea the very false prophets too, in several Countries; The wonderfull providences, and strange revolutions and alterations of this last Age, specially those of late; as the great Eclipses not many years agoe. The new Star in 1572. in 1604. and lately in 1660. The fiery Trigon begun 1603. and ended with that great Conjunction of the two supe∣rior Planets, <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in that fiery Trigon, in 1663. never before this eight hundred years <HI>(viz.</HI> at the beginning of the German Empire by <HI>Charls</HI> the Great) and hoped to be the last being the seventh only of the world; having never hap∣pened but six times before, since the Creation. And this being also the third Conjunction of those superior Planets (which is every twenty years) in the seventh fiery Trigon, and falling in the year 1663. <HI>(Rome, Rome!</HI> remember sixty three and three, was said of that year by the Astrologers.) and the great con∣gregation of all the seven Planets (in the fiery signe of Sagittary also) preceeding it (which whether ever happened before since the beginning of the world, is not known) makes some, not only take a Sign, but a beginning of some great Mutation in Religion and Government. In Religion, namely the conver∣sion of Jews, Turks and all the Nations of the Gentiles. In State, the subversion of all Tyrannicall Rule and Domination, and all manner of oppression and violence in the Earth. The too late Prodigious Comets succeeding about a year after, (as well as those in 1652. and 1618.) <HI>Saturn being in the House of Infirmity; for six month before;</HI> concerning which there is ex∣tent, a strange Prophecy found by <HI>Capistranus</HI> above two hun∣dred years agoe, and printed above an hundred agoe at <HI>Venice,</HI> and afterwards (upon the Comet in 1618. appearing,) at <HI>Pargue</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> in 1620. and said by the said <HI>Capistran</HI> to be one of the <HI>Sybill's,</HI> twenty years before Christ; concerning the ruine of the Pope and Emperor, and return of the Apostolick times. There is also some thing particular mentioned in <HI>Capistrans</HI> ex∣plication concerning <HI>France,</HI> (and others) <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="87"/>
which is forgot. The Prophecy, said to be of the <HI>Sybills;</HI> was only in figures of a Woman with a Triple Crown, embraced by a Crowned King or Emperor. With a Wheel with twelve spokes denoting the Cardinals, like the twelve Apostles. with the Arms of <HI>France, Low-Countries▪</HI> &amp;c. with other particu∣lars forgotten. From one Angel appeared a blazing Star, dart∣ing upon the Woman and Emperor, &amp;c. <HI>Capistran</HI> by a prophe∣tick Spirit wrote an explication, of every particular, in short Motto's writ underneath each; which he buried in a wall, (not daring to make it known in those times. Being an enlight∣ened Monk) and was found an hundered years after, and Prin∣ted as was said at <HI>Venice.</HI> The Motto under the Comet is only remembered, <HI>viz. Saturn in the house of Infirmity,</HI> which some Astronomers say, could be meant of no former Comet, but this last only, having examined it by their Rules. Since this we have seen the sudden irruption of the <HI>French</HI> into <HI>Flanders,</HI> &amp;c. and the peace soon made again at <HI>Aix la Chapel,</HI> and yet indeed as good as no peace, but rather a truce. It were well this pro∣phecy were better looked into to see whether any thing solid to be observed therein; or any thing that may answer and concern the present affairs, or the late Comet yea, or no.</P>
<P>In fine the most lamentable Wars, Plagues, Fires, and sad calamities and heavy and grievous judgments of Gods wrath abroad in the Earth▪ especially the astonishing <HI>Blazing Fire of London, soon after in</HI> 1666. The powerful approach and threat∣ning of the Turks, and their dreadful design upon Christen∣dom, the universal unsettlement &amp; shakings of Kingdoms and Nations, the high Animosities and Jealousies of Princes, and States, the cry of Subjects, and general failing of mens hearts for fear, and expectation of others, and the total deluge of pro∣phauness, atheisme, impenitency and unbelief, with their de∣sperate effects, namely all injustice, oppression wars, and per∣secutions, and universal corruption of manners, which make the whole Creation (of Church and State) groan for ease and
<PB N="169" REF="87"/>
deliverance from such heavy burdens; all these things, I say, seem to forspeak or intimate some dreadful matter drawing neer. Methinks one may hear as the sounding of the Hoofs of Horses at hand; and that all things will not continue still, as to this day, for ever. The sixth day (or thousandth year) of the world is drawing on towards Evening, and the Sabbath of the world to begin, &amp;c. The number of the Beast 666. almost re∣ckoned; If we expect the number of years from the Birth and Death of Christ; Behold 1666! is the number of this Age. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the number of a man, some more curious and witty, parhaps, then wise and prudent, would have spelt it out of the last Popes Name, &amp; Office, or Title thus, <HI>ALeXanDer EpIsCopVs RoMae,</HI> which is 1666. or out of all his Names only, <HI>viz.</HI> Christian Name, Sirnam, and added Name, thus. <HI>FabIVs ChIsIVs ALeXanDer.</HI> which makes 666. the number of a Mans name. Then some have added thereto VII. <HI>viz. Alexander</HI> VII. which makes 666. or 1666. and VII. over which VII. if you add to the VII of <HI>Alexanders</HI> name, make XIV. and shews the XIV chapter of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> where first is shewn, <HI>Babylon is fallen, is fallen.</HI> And they have observed it as ominous also in the present King of <HI>France's</HI> Name. <HI>LVDoVICVs</HI> XIV. Behold 666, and XIV over. And because these are past, par∣haps the same francyful wits may rove still upon the XIV. over, &amp;c. And so there will be no end of such imaginations, &amp;c. And therefore we pass by all such witty conceits as to unworthy of so great a Mystery, more solid is that of a Prophet amongst our selves reckoning 1666 from the death of Christ (whereby he got the Victory over all his Enemies,) rather then from his Birth, though the foundation was laid there. Further of the year 1670. I know not why <HI>Philip Nicholai</HI>
wrote, That if it did not bring <HI>the end of the world,</HI> yet it should bring some wonder∣ful and unexpected alteration of things. But we pass over these and such like things, &amp;c. and come to Revelations truly divine;
<PB N="170" REF="88"/>
or which to be sure are most strange, if not true. Judge no∣thing before the time.</P>
<P>But first by the way we will entertain our Reader with the proud <HI>Sultans</HI> defiance of Christendom, (who first in disdain of the Emperor, and all Christian Princes, had struck off eight hundered Prisoners Heads, before the Emperors Embassador himself.)

<SALUTE>WE send greeting to thee, Emperor <HI>Leopold;</HI>if thou wilt be our Friend, and submit to our Domination, then we will that thy Greatness be Ample.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since these times thou hast violated and shun∣ned our freindship, without having ever been offended either by War, or the fighting of God. Thou hast taken secret designs with other Kings, and other Confederates, in envy to shake of our yoak, in which thou hast done imprudently. This is it, for which thou and thy People ought to live in fear, &amp; to have no other hope but death, for which cause thou hast prepared thy self; But we tell thee, that we will go forth, and be thy Conquerour, and we will pursue thee from the East even to the West, and will make thee know our Majesty; even to the utmost confines of the
<PB N="172" REF="89"/>
Earth, thou shalt know our effects to thy great damage; of which we assure thee, and will have thee to expect our Greatness. Thy hope shall melt away, which thou hast in thy Cities, and Fortresses. We resolve absolutely to beat down and raze all that appeareth any thing considera∣ble to thine Eyes. And thou shouldst not expect any other thing or friendship▪ and shouldst not put confidence in thy strong Walls; for we have set up a resolution to destroy thee without re∣medy. It pleaseth us to forrage <HI>Germany,</HI> and to leave it behind us, to the memory of our Bloudy Sword, to the end all these things may be mani∣fest to all. It pleaseth us to establish our Religi∣on, and root out thy crucifi'd God. And we fear no colours; neither can there be any succour for thee, that thou mayst escape our hands. It plea∣seth us also to condemn to the Chain thy holy Priests, and to deliver to the Dogs, and other Sa∣vage Beasts, the dugs of thy Women. Therefore thou shalt do very wisely, if thou renounce thy Religion. Otherwayes we do order and appoint, that all be delivered to the fire. This which is said may satisfie thee; and thou mayst compre∣hend by this if thou wilt, what our will is; and the things concerning which we have discover'd the disposition of our suspition towards thee.</P>

<P><PB N="174" REF="90"/>
But to the business, namely <HI>Debricius's Revelations.</HI> But we must indeavour briefly first, to prevent all occasion of prejudice and rash and indiscreet judgment and sensures of the impeni∣tent unbeleiving and erring World. By telling how they have been approved of as truly from God, by most Godly and learn∣ed Divines here in <HI>England,</HI> as well as elsewhere, and all possi∣ble wayes and means to have been used to discover any cheat or imposture; which none have been able to do for this thirty years together.</P>
<P>To clear the Readers way to the things themselves, we shall only give a brief account of the last most severe and rigorous examination of <HI>Drabricius,</HI> in brief thus.</P>
<P><HI>Drabricius</HI> seemed to promise from God victories, and the Kingdom to <HI>Ragotzi</HI> (and other things to others, &amp;c.) who yet was killed by the Turks in 1660. which most of all made his Prophesies suspected. Those of his fraternity therefore seing all things go worse in <HI>Hungary;</HI> and least they should all suffer for the fault of one, they take councel together to remove from themselves all suspition of compliance or conspiracy with him.</P>
<P>The principal therefore among them was <HI>Felinus</HI> a Pastor of the Exciles at <HI>Puchow</HI> who wrote a book in latine called the <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> or <HI>false fire</HI> of <HI>Nicholas Drabricius.</HI> Indeavouring to demonstrate, all the Revelations of <HI>Drabricious</HI> either to be meer figments of his own brain, or meer satanical delusions; and dedicated to the <HI>Belgick</HI> Churches in <HI>Holand,</HI> which yet those from whom he required it to be printed, thought not advisable yet to do it; but rather thought him too rash and hasty. This Pastor dying according to Gods threatening by Revelations to <HI>Drabricius. Veterinus,</HI> another of the Seniors of the same Church, not at all terrified at this event, a chief insti∣gator of <HI>Felinus,</HI> undertakes the cause, which the aforesaid <HI>Pastor</HI> lost his life in, and by divers writings, letters, and epistles, to divers persons, bitterly renews the accusations, and
<PB N="175" REF="90"/>
mightily urged the Edition of the <HI>false fire,</HI> and assumed a Phy∣sician, the more to help him therein.</P>
<P>So that new Dissentions, Divisions, Schismes, Hatreds, and Scandals arose, and even those who were most perswaded of these Revelations began to hesitate and doubt. Therefore tak∣ing counsel together they decreed to bring this cause before God, in seting a part dayes of prayer, and fasting, (the means to cast out Devils) and lastly to give <HI>a Solemn Oath,</HI> the onely ordained means of God, to put an end to all striffe. The So∣lemn Form of Prayer used among all, both in <HI>Holand</HI> and else where we shall not insert here.</P>
<P>At this time one of the Juniors of the fraternity returned in∣to <HI>Hungary</HI> sent by <HI>Comenius</HI> and others with these instructi∣ons. (1.) To inform the Brethren (where ever in any place congregated) of the modren state of the controversie, and what we thought needfull to be done; and to require a fraternal co∣operation to take away scandals. (2.) That the state of the controversie lay in this, Whether Father <HI>Nicholas Drabricius</HI> did really and in truth, undergoe any divine Revelations, or whether obstinately and impiously fained them. Some Godly hope the first; <HI>Paul Veterinus</HI> affirms the last. They were to see therefore on what foundation, the one and the other built. And that it was decreed to commit the Judgment to God the Avenger. And to bring him to an examination, such as had ne∣ver yet been, by a most dreadful Oath, which is the Divine In∣stitution, for the desiding of controversies; and an extraordi∣nary one also, in such an extraordinary case. And the very form thereof out of the Divine Scriptures, to be offered to <HI>Drabricius;</HI> which if he submit to, and take, that it is our du∣ty to leave the Judgment and Vengeance to God. And <HI>Vete∣rinus</HI> if he will not rest in that, to take heed least he provoke the just Vengeance of God, in seeking to take the Sword of Vengance out of his hands.</P>
<P>And lastly, whether <HI>Drabricius</HI> would confess, and acknow∣ledge,
<PB N="176" REF="91"/>
or could remember, or any wayes find out any thing of his own added, or mixed therewith, if he submitted to this determination. With an Epistle to the Pastors and Elders of both the Churches, <HI>Puchow</HI> and <HI>Ledna;</HI> subscribed by

<HEAD>The Answer of the Ministers <HI>V. D.</HI> with the Elders of the Church of <HI>Puchow</HI> and <HI>Ledna</HI> to their Superin∣tendent, <HI>viz. Comenius.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FIlial obedience, with desire of the divine protection in such times of so sad calamities every where, &amp;c. Beloved Fa∣ther in Christ, your Letters dated to us joyntly, and signed with the subscriptions of the Reverend Fathers <HI>I. B.</HI> and <HI>N. G.</HI> and <HI>D. V.</HI> were delivered to us by the hand of our beloved Brother <HI>S. I.</HI> safely arriving here, the 8<HI>th of July.</HI> Whereby, understanding your pleasures, Reverend Fathers, we have done what you required of us, according to the instruction gi∣ven. Of the process of which whole Action, behold we inform you sincerely and with a pure conscience, in such sort as the things were transacted.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) First I the Pastor of the People of <HI>Puchow,</HI> presently
<PB N="180" REF="93"/>
the same day that I received yours, calling together the Elders of my Church, and my fellow Labourer, unsealed in their pre∣sence your letters that concern'd us jointly; and perceiving the contents, I wrote the next day early to the Brethren of <HI>Ledna,</HI> and informed them that our fellow Brother sent to us was come, and had brought singular commands to us all, and en∣treated them to come unto us, which they did the same 9<HI>th of July</HI> at evening. Where I delivered into <HI>Drabricious's</HI> hands those that concerned him, and invited him to lodge with me all night, and the rest should understand what the business was to morrow.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The next day, after publick prayers in the Holy Con∣gregation, we entered into mine, the Pastor's, House. Where after a general salutation of <HI>Drabricius,</HI> (which could not be done conveniently in the Temple,) I said, that we had an hard business before us, and therefore need again begin with Invo∣cation of mercy from God, to obtain the Grace of the Holy Spirit. When <HI>Drabricius</HI> said, <HI>Do you pray here, I will go aside into my Chamber, and perform my prayers also. And so went out.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) We therefore, first, singing that Psalm, <HI>Come Holy Ghost,</HI> &amp;c. we all prostrated our selves on our knees, and pow∣red forth our Groans to the Lord, in a prayer appointed for this very purpose.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) After prayer, we sate together in Assembly, and the Pastor of the place giving thanks that they had appeared at his desire, informed them what was to be done. Then the Com∣mon Epistle to all was read. Next the Oath prescribed for <HI>Drabricius (at the horrour of which almost all of us stood astonished and terrified.)</HI> And <HI>Fr. Samuel</HI> gave his Instructions to be read.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) After <HI>some deliberation had</HI> upon these things, <HI>Drabricius</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="93"/>
was called, and being asked by the Pastor of the place, whe∣ther he would hear the Letters from <HI>the Reverend Superinten∣dents,</HI> dated to this Assembly, and understand the contents? He assented, adding, <HI>I was not ignorant for some weeks what was about to be done concerning me; For the Lord shew'd it to me. If I had known before, I would have took you along with me, to see.</HI> I reply'd, let that alone in its own place. Let us come to the business.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) First therefore was read unto him the common Epistle; Then the form of the Oath (but before this was read I did ad∣monish and beseech him, that he would weigh all things seri∣ously. For therein were terrible things, and the matter here in agitation concerned the Salvation of his Soul.) And lastly the instructions given to <HI>Sam. Jun. To all which when he thereupon answered nothing,</HI> He was again asked, Whether he was wil∣ling to be dealt with according to these prescripts here? <HI>He answered directly. Yes, I will.</HI></P>
<P N="7">(7.) Whereupon the third Question was proposed. Whe∣ther therefore he did account, and would have accounted all his Revelations for truly Divine? And whether he did yet assert all those things to be spoken to him and written of him, by the Command of the Omnipotent God <HI>Jehova,</HI> who is not only Merciful, but is Just also, without any additions? He answer∣ed, <HI>I do assert so. Yea and I take it upon my Soul, that nothing has been added by me, and that nothing has been spoken by me, for any lucre sake, or in favour, or hatred of any person.</HI></P>
<P N="8">(8.) <HI>Proceeding further, we asked, Whether he would con∣firm it by such an Oath as was prescribed? And again we exhorted him, not to act precipitantly, but to deliberate, yea and to take time for deliberation; that we would indulge him therein. He answered,</HI> There's no need of deliberation. And
<PB N="182" REF="94"/>
rising up, and lifting up both his hands to Heaven, He thus speak; I take upon my soul, whatever there is contained in these Revelati∣ons written by me, has not at all been devised by me, nor any thing of mine own added; but only those very things which the Lord the Doinator, has commanded to be written. And I firmly believe the Holy Blessed Trinity will own all these for his, as for those which are commanded to be written by the Eternal Wisdom it self.</P>
<P N="9"><HI>(9.) Entring forth therefore unto the Table, and taking the form of the Oath into his hand,</HI> he pronounced in order, clearly, distinctly all things (omitting nothing, rather here and there super∣adding some things for more vehement asseveration sakes) with so great zeal, that all we present seeing and hearing these things, stood astonished. Some of us also trembled and wept. But in the very midst of the Oath he looked forth out of the Window <HI>(which was open)</HI> towards Heaven, crying out, Do you not see, friends, do you not see? <HI>But we asked not what he saw▪ (which in conference with Fr.</HI> Sam. J. <HI>three days after,</HI> he said he saw the Angels present with him) When he was come to the last words, about his Adversary, there he wept; having pronounced all things concerning himself with great boldness and courage.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>(10.) Having ended the Oath, he sat down, and laying his face upon the Table, he put that Paper (out of which he had recited the Oath,)</HI> after thrice kissing it, <HI>under his face. And then (All of us being astonished and silent) suddenly with drew himself away)</HI> and sung the hundred twenty third Psalm▪ (To thee have I lift up mine eyes who dwellest in the Heavens. As the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters, so our eyes look up unto the Lord our God, till he have mercy on us. Lord be merciful to us! Lord be merciful to us! for we are exceedingly fil∣led with shame. Our soul is exceedingly laden with scoffings and re∣proaches, and with the contempt of the proud) <HI>which when we all sung together and it was ended,</HI> He falling upon his knees▪ <HI>(and</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="94"/>
<HI>we with him)</HI> poured forth most fervent Prayers unto God, that God would deliver his Name from Reproach, &amp;c.</P>
<P>All which things, to be performed after this manner, all we under-written do testifie both on our Consciences, and with our hands.</P>

<P>Hence therefore all should acquiesce without further a-do; and leave all, both him and his adversary, to the divine judge∣ment and determination.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>Vetterin</HI> his Adversary, though present himself, and amazed thereat, seemed to give glory to God, and by his hand given, promised silence, and subscribed the Testimony given together with the others; yet not satisfied, and relapsing into new thoughts, has writ his dissatisfaction not only to his <HI>Ad∣junct Comenius,</HI> but has been also more bitter and violent against <HI>Drabricius</HI> then ever, for several reasons (here omited) And caused the new Pastor, <HI>Laurin,</HI> also to waver, and suspect evil of him; and to invocate God for judgement against <HI>Dra∣bricius,</HI> &amp;c. who at last answered in a writing, called his <HI>Con∣fession, which he was commanded by God should be put as a close to</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="95"/>
<HI>the new edition of his Revelations, where you have it also.</HI> After these things so transacted, <HI>Paul Laurine,</HI> the new Pastor of the Exiles, and now become a new Adversary of <HI>Drabricius,</HI> a young healthful and lusty man, was taken ill (the Physicians said of an Hectick, which in vain they laboured to cure) and dyed soon after, <HI>Veterinus</HI> still living &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is added also the Judgement of two Godly English Divines, with divers forcible Arguments for the divine Autho∣rity of these Revelations, too long for this preface.</P>
<P>To the Objection, of things not coming to pass according∣ly, &amp;c. <HI>Comenius,</HI> amongst many other things at large, replyes thus. (1.) That what ever is denounced of God and is not done to day, may be done to morrow, as with <HI>Nineveh,</HI> &amp;c. (2.) That which is not fulfilled acording to the Letter in our sence, is fulfilled according to the Spirit, in Gods sense and meaning, as of the eternal Kingdom fothwith of the Messiah, the Son of <HI>David.</HI> (3.) What is not done, the condition being al∣tered, was yet to be done, the condition not altered. As <HI>Nineveh,</HI> if it had persisted without Repentance, &amp;c. see <HI>Jer.</HI> 18. 6, 0. Add hereto, that 'tis certain the <HI>divine Prophecies</HI> were neither here∣tofore fulfilled in <HI>the letter,</HI> nor are at this day. Whence so many wild ravings of phrenzy, as it were, of the Jews, about <HI>the letter,</HI> &amp;c. That Prophetick predictions are conditional. That there is possibility of fulfilling most still. That where there is not such a possibility, it may be then thought that <HI>the Prophet</HI> has ventured to add something of his own, according to his own sense and apprehensions. For Prophets are subject to Error, Passions, Affections, &amp;c. which the spirit of Prophecy does not always take away. And that in such a case, the precious is to be sepa∣rated from the vile, as God commands, <HI>Jer.</HI> 15. 19. That all Prophecy is a Riddle and obscure; And therein God is a God that hideth himself▪ <HI>Isaiah</HI> 45. 15. &amp;c. with many other things more at large.</P>
<P>From all things therefore thus objected we are to leave the
<PB N="185" REF="95"/>
Judgement and Execution to God; who in due time will manifest the truth or the falsehood hereof, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>Comenius,</HI> some years before, namely in 1658. find∣ing all things go contrary rather to his Prophecyes, wrote se∣verely to him, and with great rebukes, &amp;c. who thus replyed, la∣menting.</P>
<P><HI>I received yours full of Zeal, full of Lamentations, full of Interrogations, to which you require me, a worm, contemn'd of men, condemned, half put to death, to answer. Which after I had read over and weighed, I had resolved to answer with si∣lence, &amp; to commend the matter to God the searcher of hearts, yet crying aloud,</HI> Come expostulate with me! But the Lord suffer'd me not to hold my peace, &amp;c. But as for me, I must say with <HI>Jeremy,</HI> Wo unto me, my Mother, that thou borest me, whom all do curse! I besprinkle these with tears, with <HI>Jeremy,</HI> saying, In truth the Lord hath commanded me, to write these things. Yet behold the word of the Lord is made unto me for a reproach, &amp;c. <HI>Is it not the voice of God which saith, The Lord doth not any thing, unless he re∣vealeth his secret to his Servants. And by</HI> Joel, <HI>he promises that it should come to pass in the last times,</HI> That their young men should see Visions, and their old men dream dreams. <HI>And why as yet, ye illuminated men, I beseech you, do you expect the last times? But because the Lord hath said unto me also</HI> (Jan. <HI>14. 1651.) a man of polluted lips,</HI> That I should be his last Trumphet, Behold I, behold with full confidence and assurance, in the sight of God, Angels and men, do boldly speak, that they are the words of God, which I have wrote. And except it were so, I know, that though I deceived men, yet I could not deceive God, nor my own conscience; but should undoubtedly procure confusion and destruction to my self. But behold, as I live, or dye, that I have writ∣ten what I have heard from the Mouth of God, let men take it as they please. <HI>To God be praise, that now the world shall no longer be ignorant of those things, which the Lord would have denounced and declared by me unto it.</HI> Let who so will dispute
<PB N="186" REF="96"/>
against those things, but not against me. For the Lord hath said unto me, his worm, Thou art not of thus much, to defend thy self, much less me, &amp; my words; I will defend my self when I shall fulfil my words. The Sons of men understand not the hight of my Councels, as neither also th Angels, until they are fulfilled. I will finish what I have begun. Let who so will, be scandalized as he will. Let this be for thy comfort, that what thou hast wrote, thou hast heard of me, not from any one of men that are like unto thy self. Be confident therefore with me my be∣loved Friend, that it will come to pass, that accusers will grow mute when the hour of God comes. <HI>For the Word of the Lord will be an heavy burden to deriders. But for us, let us more fear God, who has power to kill Body and Soul; then mortal men who can do nothing, but what God permits them. That of yours,</HI> God forgive us the hasty Edition of the Book, <HI>I thus change.</HI> Praise be unto God, who has vouchsafed us to free our Consciences, in not hiding from the Sons of Men those things, which the Mouth of God hath spoken.</P>
<P>Hereunto <HI>Comenius</HI> again, (from the increased taunts of di∣vers) and filled with greater bitterness, retorted, If you, Friend, are so certain of Gods speaking to you, that you are willing to seal it with your death, your certainty will serve for your self, but not those, whom the contrariety of events renders uncer∣tain. And we see continual examples of such as have embraced errors for truth, have been willing to lay down their lives for them, as for the very most truth, being perswaded nothing else in the sight of God, then that they had believed, taught and wrought things most true. And yet therefore did not Er∣ror cease to be Error. You give firm belief to those words spoke to you, <HI>Thou art that my last Trumpet.</HI> I but this perpe∣tually remains a question, whose voice that may be, &amp;c. Do you bid us put our hope in God? There is no where, where I can fix the Anchor of my Hope, but in him who knows the simplicity of my heart, that I have feigned nothing here; nor have added any thing to, nor taken from, nor changed those

things, which were brought in the name of God. In the thing it self if there be found error, the goodness of God will over∣look the fault of humane frailty, committed by no manner of fraud, or design. And this should be taken as a sudden confu∣sion in the sight and presence of God, instead of a chastisment, more cautiously to lead our life. But if yet at length it shall appear to have been the work of God, even this my fluctuation must necessarily serve for the greater glory of God, and the comfort or instruction of the Godly; Although I, as <HI>Moses,</HI> should suffer for it in this life. God only forbid that others, or even all our Church, should necessarily suffer ignominy and persecution for us. Whereas you exhort to praise God, that notice of these things are given to the Sons of men, I know it is written, that also the fury of men must at length praise God, and to that end, the wisedom of God is illustrated by the foo∣lishness of men. Yet the question remains, what we are to do in the mean while. Some Friends here perswade Silence. O∣thers to give glory to God, and forsake <HI>Drabricius,</HI> from whom alone almost these scandals do come. Answer what you think, and that presently. I will expect your answer with uncessant sighs and breathings to God. And indeed most open heartedly, <HI>as at the Tribunal of God, whither I cite you to appear.</HI> Deal I say candidly with me, but even now at length, <HI>I adjure you by that tremendous Name, &amp; the salvation of your Soul, by not concealing that some of those things which are so manifestly false, have been additaments of your own conjecture.</HI> This, if you shall do, the scandals in great part will cease. Because we are admo∣nished that humane devisings are fallacious. I know no more efficacious remedy; and it shall be, that God will judge you according to the Integrity of your heart, and being propitious to us all, bruise Satan under our feet, although in our own shame and confusion. May only the glory of Gods Truth stand unshaken, and none of the Godly be made sad by us or for us, much less the whole Church. <HI>I again, and again conjure you by</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="97"/>
<HI>God and your own Soul, deal sincerely with me, in this matter, now at length.</HI> The Holy good Spirit rule you. Farewel.</P>
<P>To so many obtestations of his, <HI>Drabricius</HI> returned his contestations, more sharply upbraiding the pusillanimity of his Faith. And wrote down advise and counsel, what he should do, <HI>not in his own words, but of the very Oracle it self.</HI> (Revelat. 460. afterwards.) And at length also <HI>a Preface,</HI> wherein, referring all things written by him to God alone, <HI>re∣quired them to be printed, and made known to all Nations of the Earth, (as the last will of God.)</HI> Thereby taking all our fears upon himself wholly. <HI>The Preface, or Appeal to Gods Tribunal,</HI> goes before the Revelations.</P>
<P>And therefore seeing so great, learned and Godly a man, as <HI>Comenius,</HI> after so long deliberation, and consultation with others, has thought it his duty to publish and dedicate them to all the world, let none think amiss that they are thus sum∣marily hinted in English; which very great use may be made of, however they prove, true, or false.</P>
<P>And the more to confirm <HI>Comenius</HI> herein, was, that <HI>Drabri∣cius</HI> was not alone, but <HI>two other Prophets of God</HI> had gone before, all testifying the same things for the main substance and scope thereof. The first was <HI>Cotterus</HI> a German, the second <HI>Christina</HI> a Polonian Gentlewoman. All whom, briefly thus, <HI>Comenius</HI> compares together.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>(1.)</HI> In respect of their end, <HI>for which they were raised,</HI> viz. One and the same. To stir up the Godly to attend to the works of God, which he has now in hand, in purging his Church with the fire of Persecutions, and soon after in reforming it gloriously, and in∣larging it through all the residue of the Nations of the World.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>In respect of time.</HI> Cotterus Visions began before the be∣ginning of the Pcrsecution (in <HI>Germany) An.</HI> 1616. and ended in their heat, 1624. <HI>Christina's</HI> in the middle, about the time of Imprisonments, Apostasies, and begun dispersion of the Church. <HI>An.</HI> 1628 &amp; 1629. <HI>Drabricius's</HI> after their dispersion,
<PB N="189" REF="97"/>
about the time of deliverance drawing on, and with it, from. 1638, to 1664. (and some continuations since to 1668.) For an Argument that God never forsakes his.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>If you compare them in respect of Age.</HI> The first was of full Age or mans estate, the second young, the third old. For a Testimony, that tis indifferent with God, to use the Wit, Tongue, Hand, whether of Young, perfect Age, or Old.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>If in respect of Sex.</HI> The first and the third, Men; the middlemost a Virgin, to confirm that of <HI>Joel</HI> 2. 28.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>If in respect of Condition.</HI> The first was a Tradesman, or Artizan, to be banished afterwards for the Word of God. The second a noble Virgin on both Parents side, born in Banish∣ment, and to suffer new Banishment. The third a Minister of God's Word, setled in Banishment, and to be recalled out of Banishment.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) <HI>If in respect of their fitness hereunto.</HI> Cotterus altogether an Idiot, ignorant not only of writing, but of all things (except his Trade or-Craft, and a little knowledge of Religion) that are, or are done in the World. <HI>Christina,</HI> could both read and write, and had learnt the Catechistical Principles of Religion▪ but by her age uncapable of high things. <HI>Drabricius</HI> not igno∣rant of the Divine Scriptures, as became a Minister; but scarce acquainted with the Latin Tongue; and wholly ignorant of Philosophy, History, and all Sublimer things: For an Argu∣ment, That this is not a work of human wit, but of an higher Virtue, namely of the divine influx.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) <HI>If we consider the manner of Revelation.</HI> They were made to <HI>Cotterus</HI> by Angels only. To <HI>Christina</HI> by Angels, and the Lord himself. To <HI>Drabricius</HI> only by the Lord. And indeed to <HI>Cotterus</HI> sometimes by <HI>Extasies;</HI> yet for the most part by corporal Apparition of Angels to the outward senses, in con∣stant health of Body. To <HI>Christina,</HI> by perpetual Exstasies; yet her flesh for the most part prepared thereunto and as it were mortified by antecedent pains. Then also by Dreams,
<PB N="190" REF="98"/>
and sometimes with her corporeal Eyes and Ears. To <HI>Drabri∣cius</HI> by Dreams, and by and by, by a lively Voice sounding in his Ears. The two first could remember to a word (before they were committed to writing) what they had seen and heard, if asked a thousand times, not changing a very tittle. But <HI>Drabricius</HI> distrusting perpetually his own memory, was not able to write the things revealed, without the Lord repeat∣ing, (and as it were dictating) unto him. Which we conjecture to be from hence, that their impressions came by extasies, their minds being wholly abstracted from sense. But his senses were left in their former state, like to ours, &amp;c. For he had only first a Dream, and then a Voice when he was awak'd out of his dream, God speaks after divers manners. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 1.</P>
<P N="8">(8) <HI>If we regard the form of speech;</HI> the stile is every where pro∣phetick and Divine, yet in <HI>Cotterus</HI> more sublime and high, in <HI>Christina</HI> more low, in <HI>Drabricius</HI> more familiar.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) <HI>If we attend the Types and Figures used,</HI> in Prophecy, there are many in <HI>Cotterus,</HI> fewer in <HI>Christina,</HI> scarce any in <HI>Dra∣bricius,</HI> or else presently explained, &amp;c. <HI>Cotterus</HI> declaring the morning, as it were, break of day, rising out of the deep of night; <HI>Christina</HI> clear day light; <HI>Drabricius</HI>'s points out the Sun now rising.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) <HI>As to their willingness to divulge these Revelations, and so to obey God in them,</HI> Cotterus resisted three whole years. <HI>Drabricius</HI> concealed his first Revelation five years; and be∣ing reiterated again and again, he as often suppressed them a long time, till at length the Lyon roaring, they began to be afraid, and were compelled to prophecy, the Lord command∣ing.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) <HI>If we respect the Opinion of men;</HI> All of them, were contemned and derided by some; wholly condemned by o∣thers.; as frantick, or Impostors; yet this could not stop the work.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) <HI>If we observe to whom they were sent.</HI> They were all
<PB N="191" REF="98"/>
sent primarily to their own Nation. Secondarily also unto others. <HI>Cotterus</HI> unto the Germans; <HI>Christina</HI> to the Polonians; <HI>Drabricius</HI> to the Hungarians; and from hence to all the Na∣tions of the Earth, which they are all commanded to call unto, and declare the last Will of God unto all.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) <HI>If for what they were sent:</HI> the two formost were sim∣ply Prophets, foretelling things to come. But the last a Pro∣phet, preaching what ought to be done; exhorting to duty, and urging with promises and threatnings.</P>
<P N="14">(14.) <HI>They were all commanded to conceal their Prophesies for a time, or to communicate them only to the Godly,</HI> that were afflict∣ed, for their consolation; yet at last not to hold their peace but to speak to Kings, Princes, and all People, universally: For <HI>Cotterus</HI> was sent to the Elector Palatine, King of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and was heard in the presence of the Grandees; as also to the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> more then once, but to the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> did his errand by others, several times. <HI>Christina</HI> could not but write Letters to the Duke of <HI>Fridland,</HI> and carry them her self; as also <HI>Drabricius</HI> to the Princes of <HI>Transilvania.</HI> Therefore none of these things were done in a corner.</P>
<P N="15">(15.) <HI>All of them were commanded to speak and do things un∣usual, absurd to reason, perilous to their lives;</HI> declaring a thing incredible to the States-men, the subversion of the house of <HI>Austria;</HI> and to most of Divines offensive, and scandalous, the destruction of the Pope before the last day, yet they were com∣manded constantly to speak and write these things. <HI>Cotterus</HI> also to go to <HI>Glogovia</HI> where he knew he should suffer bonds and prison. <HI>Christina</HI> to write terrible things against (the Im∣perial General) <HI>Wallestein</HI> and carry them herself to his house; <HI>Drabricius</HI> to call the Nations together, against the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and Popedom, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="16"><HI>(16.)</HI> They were all severally examined by Divines, Physicians, Politicians and States-men, and intire Universities, Consistories,
<PB N="192" REF="99"/>
Synods. <HI>Yet they all perplexed the reasoning▪ of all the most High▪ Learned, and Wise,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="17">(17.) <HI>The last Revelation to Cotterus,</HI> which was of the tir∣rible execution of God's Judgement against the Babylonish Whore; to <HI>Christina,</HI> which was against <HI>Wallestein,</HI> (which had its effect) were made by Visions in their sleep; <HI>the last made to Drabricius</HI> (when he was first commanded to put to a close) had its beginning in sleep, but the rest awake; and his Eyes open, being roused up by the clamors of the Jesuits; undoubtedly to represent, that although all may seem to be but a dream, even to the Godly; yet it shall conclude in a real work and effect; that the world by seeing may see.</P>
<P N="18"><HI>(18.)</HI> The two first Prophecies ended in silence, <HI>after they had been commanded once to seal them; suffering no more Visi∣ons, nor did see the deliverance.</HI> But <HI>Drabricius</HI> after he was commanded to conclude, and dye; yet was again commanded to resume both Life and a double Spirit to prophesie, &amp; received a pro∣mise not to see death, till <HI>he had seen the Glory of God spread up∣on the Nations of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>And for further confirmation, it might be shewn from Church history that the spirit of Prophecy hath alwayes been in the Church, and that in several ages God hath raised Pro∣phets, and sent Visions, and Revelations, unto men, But that it would be to large for the design of this present Table. We will only name the more known and recorded as <HI>Hermes</HI> the Shepherd; The Monk of <HI>Uguetine,</HI> Fryer <HI>Robert, Capistran, Lichtenbergts, Carion, Theophrastus,</HI> St. <HI>Hildegardis, Elizabeth, Mechthilda, Briget, Katharin Senensis,</HI> &amp;c. Particularly in the time of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> about 1150. the Religious Virgin <HI>Hilde∣gardis,</HI> approved of by the same Father, &amp; about the same time <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a <HI>German</HI> Virgin, Abbess of <HI>Schonaugh,</HI> familiar with <HI>Hildegard.</HI> Fryer <HI>Robert</HI> a Frenchman, about the year 1290. about the year 1370. St. <HI>Briget</HI> in <HI>Swedland.</HI> And 1380. St. <HI>Katharin</HI> of <HI>Senna.</HI> And 1508. <HI>Joseph Grunpeck</HI> Priest, All of
<PB N="193" REF="99"/>
them for the main tending to the same thing with those, Name∣ly, taxing the abominable Corruptions of the Roman Clergy, the whole Papacy, and Pope himself, and threatning destru∣ction thereto; besides many others more ordinarily inspired and inlightened; And besides the several particular Prophets every where, in each Country, concerning particular Nations, or Churches, &amp;c. And therefore if Papists, or those inclined that way, shall slight these Prophesies, as out of another spirit; From what spirit then, have their own <HI>He and she Saints,</HI> Pro∣phesied, the same things; Therefore they may be their own Judges in this matter.</P>
<P>And <HI>Machiavil</HI> himself was not such an Atheist and Infidel, but that he acknowledged Gods usual manner of foretelling all great Revolutions. I beseech you, <HI>O Divines! saies <HI>Come∣nius,</HI> let not Politicians exceed you, in attention to the Words and Works of God; <HI>Machiavil,</HI> comparing former times with present, as he easily confesses, He knows not the cause; so he also sayes it ought to be acknowledged out of all Ancient, and Modern Exam∣ples; That all great Motions whatsoever, that have happened ei∣ther to a City, or a Country, have been wont to be foretold, by either Guessers and Conjecturers, or some Revelation, or Prodigies, or Signs in the Heavens.</HI> And confirms it by a domestick exam∣ple of Charls the 8th. <HI>his coming into</HI> Italy, <HI>foretold by</HI> Savana∣rola, <HI>that excellent man, and Martyr,</HI> &amp;c,</P>
<P>And more particularly to confirm also <HI>Cotterus</HI> and <HI>Christi∣na's</HI> Revelations, there are further convincing Arguments, as well as for those of <HI>Drabricius,</HI> which would be too Heterogene to insert here fully.</P>
<P>Some of <HI>Cotterus's</HI> were seal'd in the Court three times, by particular relation from his own Mouth; The rest by Godly and able men, worthy of credit, &amp;c. And this was wonder∣ful, that he had such a Divine memory of all impressed into him, that he could recite each word, yea tittle, in the same or∣der, he heard them, although he should recite them an hun∣dred
<PB N="194" REF="100"/>
times, which must needs be from some extraordinary understanding and illumination. And are all consonant to truth, respect Gods Glory, and full of comfort. And in divers Visions he (as the other two also) were incouraged not to re∣gard what men said or thought thereon at all, which he urged to the Lord as his trouble and impediment, as may be seen no∣tably in divers Revelations, which we will pass over with many other remarkable passages.</P>
<P>The chiefest enemy of <HI>Cotterus</HI> was one of the Emperial Tre∣surers of the Exchequer,, who swore he would not rest till he saw him and another Minister hanged; He was at last taken and brought before him, examined and at length committed to Prison; All his writtings they could find seased on and ex∣amined. At length he was brought forth to Tryal and was questioned, <HI>From whom he had these Fictions that he vented un∣der the name of Visions.</HI> But he constantly asserted, <HI>from no mor∣tal Wight, but from those spirits which were wont to appear to him, and again, disappeared. Which whether they were good or evil Angels he, a simple Idiot, could not judge; but left it to the Lear∣ned and Wise to do.</HI> The Earle that seized on him inclined to dismiss him on certain conditions. But the Treasurer refused and was more violent; And the other Minister question'd for his life. That with his most lying Pen abusing the simplicity of a phanatick man, he had written Treason against the Emperor, who excused that what they had done was by the command of the Senate. But the Senate bailed their Pastor, under the pe∣nalty of two thousand Gold Crowns to appear; but <HI>Cotterus,</HI> the Treasurer committed to closer prison, till he was almost famished. An entire volumn of his Visions was by his enemyes brought to the Earl, who when he had read them, would no more meddle in the business, and procured that <HI>Cotterus</HI> should have counsel to defend himself. The definitive Sentence was not known; for the Treasurer being newly Marryed to a No∣ble Lady, upon some occasions went a journey, and in his re∣turn
<PB N="195" REF="100"/>
was suddenly taken with vehement gripings of the belly, one evening in the very Suburbs of <HI>Sprottavia</HI> (where he threa∣tened to see him hanged with the Minister) and possessed with I know not what fear, would take nothing prescribed by the Physitians that was called; But would defer it till next day, that his disease might better discover it self; <HI>but dyed suddenly in the night,</HI> There, where he had purposed to hang those Saints of God; which raised a terror in all the City, &amp;c. So that his Enemyes being hereby terrified, durst not publish the Sentence against him, but used him better in prison, and with more freedom to himself, and access of his Wife and Friends; who urged his dismission or execution; so that his adversaries be∣ing never at rest, after some months deliberation, brought him forth out of prison, set him in the Pillory, in the Market place bound him in an Iron Collor, and a paper affixed on his head, <HI>This is the false prophet who hath foretold those things which are not come to pass:</HI> And so was sent away out of the City, by the common Executinor▪ and Banished, and lived so twenty years, &amp;c. Not long after the former Minister, and another friend of <HI>Cotterus,</HI> had likewise a mervellous deliverance (by apparition of an Angel;) out of the City upon the Imperial Armies en∣trance, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Cotterus</HI> also had a Miraculous Cure and Recovery from an Epidemical Distemper, which had seized on him, (with his Wife, Daughter, and another of the house, so that they all lay down of it; At which time his Wife also saw one of the Spirits enter the Room one evening. She asked her Husband who it was; who said, it was one of the Spirits, that were wont to ap∣pear to him.</P>
<P>The Spirit wishing health to him, asked him how he did. As a poor miserable man can be, said he, whom the Lord hath visited. The Spirit then said, Be of good chear, God will raise thee up. Cut thee three morsels of Bread, Eat, and take three spoonfuls of Ale, the disease will leave thee. He did so, and
<PB N="196" REF="101"/>
was rap't into an Extasie and had Visions, &amp;c. And after retur∣ning to himself, was wholly well.</P>
<P>We must also pass over the innumerable wonderful things, that in particular concern <HI>Christina</HI> likewise, &amp; her Extasies and Visions, &amp;c. As (1.) how she was wonderfully restored from her grievous distempers on a sudden, by a Voice, in her Exta∣sie, saying, <HI>I am he which kill, and make alive;</HI> at which (as at all the rest following) the Physitians were confounded. (2.) That being an healthful young Virgin, she was suddenly de∣prived of the use of her feet, for six weeks, and not able to stand a moment, and without any help▪ suddenly restored by a Vision. (3.) That she was suddenly struck dumb, for eight dayes, and on a sudden also restored to speech. (4.) Suddenly struck Deaf, and Dumb, with a Feaver, and Delirium, and a∣gain suddenly recovered in her Extasie and Vision. (5.) In∣tolerable pains, torments and disquietments on a sudden, and in a moment delivered in an Extasie. (6.) Horrible and desperate temptations of the Devil, overcome &amp; vanquish'd wonderfully, by the Divine Power and Presence with her in her Visions or Extasies in more then an ordinary manner. (7.) Something inflicted by Gods immediate hand in a Vision, to remain all the dayes of her life to humble her; but she discovered not what it was. (8.) Her <HI>wonderful Death</HI> and indeed <HI>Resurrection,</HI> as we may say. All which <HI>her Tutour Comenius</HI> was an Eye witness of. This last we will give you more fully and particularly, for the confirmation of all.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Virgin</HI> struck with an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> and forwarned by divers Signs of imminent Death.</HEAD>
<P>On the second of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1629. at break of day, desiring to rise from her Bed, she beheld a Woman all in Mourning Habit, with a Vail, covering her face all over, standing by. With which sight affrighted, she leapt out of Bed, and her Cham∣ber;
<PB N="197" REF="101"/>
and told not till three dayes after, upon occasion, what she had seen.</P>
<P>Eight dayes after she was warned by an Angel of an Apo∣plexy to befal her speedily. Which Dream having wrote down (as all her former) she declared to none. At night rising from supper, <HI>she fell down suddenly,</HI> struck with a Dead Palsie on her Tongue, Right Hand, and Foot, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next day at night calling for her Tutor <HI>Comenius,</HI> she de∣clared to him her approaching death by an Apoplexy. She also heard <HI>strange knockings,</HI> and as it were <HI>strikings of a Clock,</HI> for several hours. At last one of the company, a Senatour and Magistrate of the City, said, <HI>I have counted the strokes now twice. they are thirteen. Then they all counted, and found just so many,</HI> six several times over. Afterwards it sounded, three times four, and one besides; By and by, four times three; and one again; six times two, and one; and then two times six, and one. Infine, <HI>the same number thirteen repeated, eighteen times over,</HI> and then ceased. They all then began to presage <HI>her death thirteen dayes after.</HI> The next day also in the presence of much company, was heard <HI>a noise preceeding, intimating that it was about to strike.</HI> It struck then twelve, nine times. The next day only eleven, four times. And ceased till the day before her death, <HI>which happened just thirteen days after accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>A Certain Pastour coming and speaking to comfort and pre∣pare her against approaching Death: She said, when he was gone to her Tutour <HI>Comenius. That good old man little thinks that he must first of all the Pastors pass into the Eternal Country.</HI> Being asked. How she knew? <HI>I was now with the Lord,</HI> said she; <HI>And I saw Pastors, who live here, coming, one after another, of whom he was first.</HI> Comenius asked, what Pastors? she rec∣koned up several, even <HI>Stadius,</HI> a lusty, strong, and healfull man, and younger then all the rest. <HI>Comenius</HI> then asked, con∣cerning himself. <HI>I saw not you,</HI> said she; <HI>and therefore I asked the Lord, who answered, he cannot come yet; For he have some yet</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="102"/>
<HI>to reconcile. It fell out accordingly;</HI> The said Minister went first, and one after another, even <HI>Stadius</HI> himself at last, in the four∣tieth year of his age, <HI>An.</HI> 1634. and <HI>Comenius</HI> yet lives now fourty years since, who testifies all these things to be true, as in the sight of God; whose Testimony the world knows too well to be slighted. But to return to her.</P>
<P>Several Students desiring some written remembrance from her, she not only wrote her own name; but also places of Scripture, and <HI>with her left hand (though never before) as well as ever with her right.</HI> And on the very day of her death, she gave to her Tutour <HI>Comenius,</HI> her <HI>Bohemian</HI> Psalter, and wrote in the Frontispeece an excellent Valedictory Ejaculation, as it yet remains to be seen,—<HI>Bring back</HI> Jehova, <HI>our Captives, like streams into a dry Land,</HI> &amp;c. And underneath,<LB/>
<Q><HI>This I have written for a Remembrance to my Nursing and Be∣loved Father in Christ, J. A. Comenius. Christina Poniatovia.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The night before her death, several present, <HI>One knocked at the Gate. They open'd, and saw no body;</HI> So that they were all aston shed. Then presently they heard <HI>knockings by her Bed side,</HI> two several times. All present rising up amazed, <HI>strokes were heard upon the Table</HI> (whereat they all sat before) five seve∣ral times. After Singing Psalmes, &amp;c. She desired all to de∣part, and leave her a light, that she should pass that night wak∣ing; and ordered, Pen Ink and Paper to be brought her, and wrote with her left hand, (1.) <HI>Her Will,</HI> (2.) <HI>An Epistle to her Lady where she resided; and,</HI> (3.) <HI>The forementioned Valedicti∣on to her Tutour;</HI> and spent the rest of her time in reading and prayer. After midnight she heard <HI>knocking again, and a Voice. Come, come, come!</HI> Next morning she said, she <HI>waited for five a clock at night,</HI> and bid farewel to all that came to visit her.</P>
<P><HI>About three a clock the Superintendents of the</HI> Bohemian <HI>Church, with some other Pastors, thought good, to examine her of her Faith, Hope, and Conscience, specially in the busi∣ness</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="102"/>
<HI>of her Visions.</HI> Whether she did yet assert, to have them truly from God? whether that was certain? whether she was sufficiently assured? That she would confess now, being about to go into the pre∣sence of the Eternal Judge, what ever she was Conscious to her self of. <HI>She answered,</HI> as truly as God is God; so truly are these Reve∣lations his Work. Which God will make your Eyes to see. <HI>Being asked,</HI> had she then written and sealed, what she had revealed to her, in good Faith and Truth? <HI>She answered;</HI> whatsoever I have heard, and was commanded to be written, is all written, not one tit∣tle omited, added, or altered. And for the things I saw in Visions, I have expressed as well as I could in my own words, but with no fraud or counterfetting, God knows. <HI>Then she blessed them,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Her Death and Resurrection.</HEAD>
<P>Half an hour before five she would be lifted up out of her Bed; And then cryed out, <HI>Lord Jesus have Mercy upon me, and put an end to my pains.</HI> About five, she bad her last farewel to all, with her left hand, being not able with her right, &amp;c. And af∣ter prayers of all present, she fell into a fit, <HI>and so quietly depart∣ed.</HI></P>
<P>But after some time, all went away save two Ladies, and <HI>Comenius,</HI> with the Nurses, and when her feet and hands were quite grown cold, and stiff, like any dead person's; Then those Ladies and <HI>Comenius</HI> also departed, leaving the Nurses, <HI>to lay her out.</HI> But whilst they were yet going out of the door, <HI>one of the Nurses cryes out;</HI> They looking back, saw her <HI>risen straight upright upon the Bed; and asking for her cloaths.</HI> Come∣nius intreats them to leave her, and went down with them, full of fear and trembling All; leaving only their attendants to relate what was done. <HI>Comenius</HI> returns, goes into his Study; <HI>But Behold! She was now dressed, and stood at the Wather-cistern, washing her Hands and Face; and his Wife with two other Nurses looking on.</HI> Comenius stood astonished, <HI>My</HI> Christina, <HI>what is</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="103"/>
<HI>the matter; In the Name of the living God tell me!</HI> She; <HI>I live, you see;</HI> And goes on to wash again. <HI>Comenius</HI> again, <HI>For Gods sake, what is the matter! may we believe our own Eyes?</HI> She, <HI>I live!</HI> And your hand and foot whole and perfect? <HI>Perfect∣ly,</HI> said she. But what has been done? She; <HI>I was now with my Lord; but am commanded to return to injoy his goodness in the Land of the Living. Ask no more now, to morrow I will note down the whole business.</HI> So they sat down to supper, <HI>and she with them very chearful and well.</HI> But eat nothing. Many Friends and Neighbours came in,—&amp;c. Afterwards she sung Psalms, &amp;c. and next day wrote down all for a close of her Revelations, which you have afterwards.</P>
<P>Of the whole, <HI>Comenius</HI> sayes, this is certain, that it seemed a true and real death in our eyes; and that she could not in a moment be restored to life, health, and full strength, without the special and immediate Power of God intervening.</P>
<P>All other Divines also after various and different apprehen∣sions of the thing, yet were all at length inclined to think <HI>it a true Miracle,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And not long after there was a strict, and solemn examina∣tion of her Visions, and all these things, in an Assembly of Divines, where they could not consent to give their Judgment absolutly; But only decreed silence, to avoid all offence, and scandal to the Church; till God and time should discover fur∣ther, &amp;c. Also some years after another assembly met, when events seemed not answerable to predictions; where yet they could not condemn the thing, but commit it yet unto God.</P>
<P>She lived after this, fifteen years, married twelve, had two Sons, and three Daughters; one Son, and one Daughter yet alive.</P>
<P>The brief Series of the remarkable Vicissitudes of her life, added to her Funeral Sermon, was this.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Christina Poniatovia,</HI> was born of Noble Parents at <HI>Lescina</HI> in <HI>Prussia, An.</HI> 1610. And with the same Parents, (suffer∣ing
<PB N="201" REF="103"/>
Persecution in their Country for the Gospel) came into <HI>Bohemia, An.</HI> 1615. Whence being again driven away with them by the storm of Persecutions, and going into <HI>Moravia,</HI> she was commited to some Noble Matrons, to be bred up in Services and the exercises of virtue; and at length the last time removed with others into Banishment; She lost her Mother, <HI>An.</HI> 1626. her Father, 1628. She began to be ad∣mitted to that extraordary and miraculous work of God, <HI>An.</HI> 1627. which ceased, <HI>in the recalling of her dead, in the Eyes of men, into life. An.</HI> 1626. at <HI>Lesna</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> where three years after, by the will of God and her Tutors, she was married,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>She underwent several examinations, first of her Father, a solid Divine, and most violent opposer of Neoterick Revela∣tions; who endeavoured both by Letters, dehortations, ob∣testations, and severe threatnings to stop her; till by all her an∣swers, and his own Eyes, <HI>he apprehended the error to be in himself, and gave glory to God.</HI> The next, was of Divines, Politicians, Physitians, inquiring most curiously into all things; but could find nothing but <HI>the Finger of God,</HI> &amp;c. Then by the Pastors and Elders of the Church at the hour of her death, as before. And the worst of all was of the Devil, both at the beginning, and afterwards several times, undergoing horrible temptati∣ons, &amp;c. Besides all the Divine Tryals, and Testimonies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Very remarkable also was the Devils Mock-Games, that he played about this time by raising other false extasies in some. Whereof <HI>Comenius</HI> mentions two. First of a Virgin undergo∣ing Extasies, in a Village which <HI>Christina's</HI> Father passed through, with a throng of people about her, <HI>An.</HI> 1628. <HI>Speak∣ing wonderful things in her Fits, foretelling Persecutions of the Church, exhorting to repentance, and perswading to constancy in the Faith</HI> &amp;c. Hereby it was thought that God had raised up others in like manner to confirm the same things. But after strict
<PB N="202" REF="104"/>
inquiry all appeared to be nothing <HI>but a few frivolous Dreams of one sick, or at least slight Mockings of Satan.</HI></P>
<P>But more cunningly the Devil plaid his part at <HI>Geneva</HI> the same year, whereby the Learned there were for a time preju∣diced against these Revelations; when as before both <HI>Diodat, Vedelius and others</HI> by letters approved them. But the Devil at last smelt of Hell, and the truth of these thereby more ap∣peared. The story in short, this.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The Son of a Senator twelve years old was seized with a Disease; by and by began to speak <HI>unusual things,</HI> at length asserts, that he was, <HI>that very Spirit, which had shewn Lions, Men, and other wonderful Visions, that should certainly come to pass, to</HI> Christina, <HI>a Virgin of Poland,</HI> &amp;c. which things at first though they seemed to hang together well enough, and further confirmed the Divines, (so that they wrote letters thereof.) Yet when by degrees he at length swarved unto frivolous matters, and at last things manifestly absurd in the presence of two Divines, one of them said, <HI>I see the finger of Satan,</HI> &amp;c. Which mockages continuing for some dayes made all suspected. So that after solemn prayers and fasting of the Senate, Pastors, and the Church, during which the <HI>un∣clean Juglar</HI> began <HI>strange postures, and to be troublesome,</HI> &amp;c. amongst other things saying, <HI>They will not beleive, that I am a good Angel sent of God. But I will prove it by a Miracle; And snatching some way or other a Knife▪ thrust it into his Breast, and drew it out again unhurt, and fell upon the ground, crying, Be∣hold a Miracle!</HI> At last the unclean spirit seeing he must be gone out, wreath divers wayes the youths body, belching out of his mouth <HI>Blasphemous and obscene words,</HI> till he was forced to give place to the prayers of the Church, and the Power of God.</Q> But the youth was conscious of nothing, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">More cunning yet was that (to invalidate <HI>Drabricius's</HI> Vi∣sions) of a Souldier in 1659. who falling sick, got leave to return home, and languishing away seemed to dye, and was

ready to be buried; but when the Neighbors came to his burial, they felt his <HI>Breast</HI> to be <HI>something warm, and defer'd it till the Morrow;</HI> and <HI>then the next day, for eight dayes,</HI> no other sign of life appearing. But he, <HI>the Night before Burtal, rises up, declares that he had special Commands to Prince</HI> Ragotzi, (un∣der whom he had served) <HI>requires admission into his Castle,</HI> two miles off. Is admitted, the Chancellor, and Master of the Hall, and others present; relates his Commands from God; <HI>That the Prince take Arms Couragiously against the Turk; that God would raise up the Emperor of</HI> Mosco▪ <HI>to help him; who should come and besiege</HI> Constantinople <HI>with an huge Army; At the same time, that the Prince go against</HI> Buda, (the Metropolis of <HI>Hungary,) at Whitsontide to take it. Rehearsing these things on his bended knees, he arose, praysing God, that he had granted him to fulfil his Commands;</HI> These things could not but seem con∣trary to <HI>Drabricius's.</HI> The Prince it should seem, believed him: for he acted according to these things, not the other of <HI>Drabricius;</HI> And <HI>Drabricius</HI> himself also believed this to be a Prodigy from God himself: by a Vision concerning this thing. Wherein yet God asserted no more than this. (1.) <HI>That his words, by</HI> Dribricius <HI>were also true, if the Prince would have followed them.</HI> (2.) <HI>That Counsellours that follow the figments of their own heart, seduce themselves, and know not how to counsel neither themselves, nor their Masters.</HI> (3.) <HI>And that those that do so, shall be destroyed.</HI> Whence it may be well thought, that this was a <HI>Satanical Mockery,</HI> both the Sickness, Death, Resur∣rection, and Prophesie; seing nothing fell out accordingly, but rather the ruine of the Prince, who was <HI>seduced, like</HI> Ahab <HI>by</HI> Zedekiah and his companions: God giving them up <HI>to believe a lye, who will not believe the Truth.</HI> And therefore this is to be reckoned of the same nature with the former Ex∣tasies mentioned of <HI>the Geneva Boy,</HI> opposed by Satan, to the Exstasies of <HI>Christina.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As for the Evidence of Events. Whatsoever concerned
<PB N="204" REF="105"/>
her own person, alwayes came to pass. But for those things which concerned the World or the Church, although they may seem contrary, yet because there seems to be a disposing of Providence towards the accomplishment of the main: we may say with St. <HI>Austin</HI> (says <HI>Comenius) when many things are fulfilled, He is preverse who contemns a Prophet. Divine Prophesies,</HI> said a great man, <HI>alwayes smell of their Author, to whom a thousand years are but as one day, and one day a thousand years.</HI> And about the events of Prophesies there are three cautions. (1.) of <HI>Chrysostom, That all Prophesies are not fulfilled to Sense, and the Letter,</HI> &amp;c. and he instances out of Scripture. Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> who received so many Blessings from his Father, scarce injoyed one, &amp;c. (2.) Of <HI>Grotius, that for some things not fulfilled, are not to be called in question those things that are clearly fulfilled.</HI> As the Jews bring many things obscure, or that receive a divers signification concerning the Messiah; for which those that are manifest ought not to be denyed. (3.) Of God, <HI>To believe in Hope against Hope;</HI> and not pass rash judgement through un∣belief on Divine predictions, though they never appear to our apprehension, &amp;c. <HI>for Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. Again, all things were not evidently fulfilled to appearance, to the Ancient Prophets. Therefore deriders said, <HI>Where is the Word of the Lord, let it come,</HI> &amp;c. Jer. 17. 15. But God does not want causes, to defer his promises, or threatnings, or to change them, and has been pleased to render reasons. <HI>Jona</HI> 4. <HI>Jer.</HI> 18. <HI>Psal.</HI> 89. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 30. Besides <HI>we understand not as his Works, so neither his Words,</HI> till performed, and that not al∣wayes. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>John</HI> 16. <HI>The Beginning of a thing is taken with God for the thing it self.</HI> God measures dayes and hours, not as we. That which is not fulfilled to day, may be to morrow. As <HI>Ninive</HI> after fourty years: though not fourty dayes. Gods Mercy is so great, that he seems to appear false, rather then not merciful. If, lastly, events do'nt answer, blame man as some way faulty. Thus <HI>Comenius.</HI> And <HI>Drabricius</HI> himself in seve∣ral
<PB N="205" REF="105"/>
Visions, is advertiz'd to the same sense and purpose, &amp;c. But these things have been hinted once and again before.</P>
<P>But Behold the Atheistical age! who think God reveals nothing now unto men. All humble and sober observance of extraordinary Signs, Dreams, Extasies, prophetick Inspirati∣ons, Angelical Apparitions, Prodigies in the Heavens, &amp;c. (As Comets, New Stars, Suns, unusual Tempests, Sights of Armies fighting in the Air, Sounds of Drums and Trumpets, &amp;c.) passes for foolish superstition or fancy. And all is attributed either only to natural causes, or chance, or vain imagination, and nothing to God. Which God grievously complains of, <HI>Amos</HI> 4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. This is the last security of the World, that Faith will not be found on Earth, &amp;c. And as in the dayes of <HI>Noah</HI> (when all were so secure) so it shall be in the last dayes, all things shall be full of Prodigies in Heaven, and Earth, of Bloud, Fire, and Smoke; of Dreams, Visions, and Prophesies. <HI>Joel</HI> 2. 28. &amp;c. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. And things speak as much; so many various Prodigies in our age in Heaven Earth, Sea, and several Creatures, were never in any Age be∣fore; even in <HI>Germany</HI> alone, within this half Century, so ma∣ny have been noted and recorded of this kind, as never the like. And of <HI>England</HI> the same, &amp;c. Surely God means hereby to have men warned of greater and more wondrous works of his providence shortly to follow. Nor were ever more Pro∣phets, and divinely inspired, then in this Age; at least since the Apostacy of the Church. For there were and are, Men and Women, Old and Young, Noble and Ignoble, Learned and Unlearned, Clergy and Secular, who have had true prophetick Dreams, Illuminations, Raptures, Angelical Apparitions, and speakings with God; who have spoken and written unusual things of the enkindled Wrath of God, of approaching Judge∣ments, and the Universal change of Things. Especially in <HI>Bohe∣mia</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> where the terrible Persecutions of the Church were foretold to begin. Of whom sixteen, that had Vi∣sions
<PB N="206" REF="106"/>
and Revelations, and also printed, <HI>Comenius</HI> reckons up. And it is not unknown that of late, and now, there are Pro∣phetick spirits in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. But of all these the most Eminent are these three, <HI>Cotterus, Christina,</HI> and <HI>Drabrici∣us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There were also between</HI> Christina, <HI>and</HI> Cotterus <HI>two other Prophets, foretelling the imminent Judgement upon</HI> Babylon, <HI>and of the wrath of God, kindled against the World, and of the Plagues a coming. The one a plain Country man,</HI> to whom, at his work in the Field, an Augel of the Lord appeared, An. <HI>1625. The other a Taylor, who from 1625. to 1628.</HI> had a certain voice sounding round about him, revealing things to come, and com∣manding him to write them. And at length an Angel in a visible form appeared unto him, <HI>to take his farewel, with these words;</HI> Because thou so much desirest to see me, although I am by nature in∣visible, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And thus I hope we have not been too tedious to clear our Readers way from prejudice, which we could not do with more brevity so as we ought; And that they will think so long a preface altogether necessary, and no wayes impertinent. If at last there should prove nothing in all these things, certainly the divine Providence seems to play with poor Mortals; and the story deserves to be recorded.</P>
<P><HI>We will conclude with</HI> Comenius <HI>caution concerning</HI> Christi∣na. <HI>Not to pass rash Judgement, or over-hasty Execution.</HI> This is the property of all Prophesies, that they first fulfil'd, before they are understood; And if it shall happen, that the events prove otherwise; yet these things will be profitable and serviceable to Posterity; I pray and tall to witness. Let it suffice our Church once to have dared what no university or Consistory before us hath at∣tempted, to pass a Condemnatory Sentence against these things. Let it suffice I say, and serve for a caution. I, if it shall please the Lord to call me hence, will seal it with my Death; that I have forwarned that the Church no more offend in this kind; And that
<PB N="207" REF="106"/>
not one, or two, or three, usurp power to determine of such matters, which regard the judgement to the whole Church, and so of Posterity it self also. <HI>Yea, and if any one dare commit this Book to the fire; such a one as he, I cite to the Tribunal of Christ, there to give an account of his inordinate passion and affection.</HI></P>

<P>And yet further before we end this long preface (which so mainly concerns the validity of all that follows, and is for an Apology.) Those that do not, must know, that our Authour <HI>Comenius,</HI> is the only surviving Superintendent, or Bishop, of the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Church now in Exile, fourty years and over; A man of universal knowledge and learning, of a large and de∣lusive spirit, and of a sincere and single heart; as all Christen∣dom can bear witness of. A true <HI>Virtuoso of all Divine and Hu∣mane Science and Experiance;</HI> A man given to no fancies and whimsies, nor self-ends and designs; But of vast and universal Aims and desires, for the universal good of Mankind, the World and the Church; and one that hath sore travalled for the promoting of <HI>universal Knowledge,</HI> Literature, Art, Sience, and Virtue, both Humane and Divine; as appears by the <HI>Janua Linguarum,</HI> and his other labours; and more particu∣larly his <HI>late Treatise</HI> for the spreading of Light, &amp; Knowledg universally, <HI>dedicated to the Royal Society of</HI> Englands <HI>Virtu∣oso's.</HI> And lastly one that most severely rebuked <HI>Drabricius</HI> for still persisting in his wild Fancies and Dreams (as he then thought) till he was at length convinced of the Finger of God therein; as appears by the concertation he had with him, as follows.</P>
<P>Drabricius <HI>in his Visions, had promised him an Associate, called</HI> his Adjunct, <HI>to help carry on this work of God in the World, which</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="107"/>
<HI>was this</HI> Comenius. <HI>And indeed who so sit? And first he was commanded by the Lord to inform</HI> Comenius <HI>of his first Visions, and to send them to him; which accordingly he did, about</HI> An. 1644. <HI>And this was all that ever</HI> Comenius <HI>had to do concerning them, till</HI> 1650. <HI>when after that the General Peace of</HI> Munster <HI>seemed to defeat all their hopes and expectations,</HI> Comenius <HI>was by Pro∣vidence unexpectedly brought into those Parts again, about Affairs of the Church. There</HI> Drabricius <HI>was urgent with him to go to the Prince; He replyed.</HI> What do you hear, my Brother; Are not you awake yet out of your Dreams? <HI>(Condemning, as well as others all of Vanity, Because they did not reach the prophetick gra∣vity of Stile like</HI> Cotterus's <HI>and</HI> Christina's, <HI>and the events seem∣ed to answer much less)</HI> You first offer'd the Crown to the Father, and now deluded of that Hope, you would go to the Son. In the name of God, see what you do; and desist to delude your self and others. <HI>The man shed Tears, and lifting up his Eyes and Hands,</HI> I could twice wash my self, with my Tears, <HI>sayes he,</HI> As much as has already been powred forth of them, that God would spare me miserable man; But I cannot obtain. <HI>Have you then Visions yet, said</HI> Comenius? It is a bove a year, <HI>said he,</HI> that I have had none; yet I know, that there is not an end of them. <HI>How do you know?</HI> The Lord told me, <HI>sayes he;</HI> and commanded that they should be sealed, and kept for your coming, and delivered to you. For that you should come into this Land; Behold! Here, I deliver them; and besought him to read them. Do not you faigne this I pray, <HI>said Comeni∣us.</HI> He calls God to witness! <HI>Comenius asked, when did you hear that concerning my coming hither?</HI> Three years since, <HI>said he,</HI> presently after the Princes death, when through impatience of these mockeries, I would have burnt those. But the Lord for∣bad; you will find it there written.</P>
<P><HI>Comenius</HI> upon Meditation, Prayer, and Conference with Friends, found his mind changed. So many causes, offering themselves for taking a Journey to the Prince, which before
<PB N="209" REF="107"/>
he had not observed. And calling his Brethren to pray toge∣ther, he did accordingly, &amp;c. And so afterwards the Visions returned to <HI>Drabricius</HI> again, more solemn then before; and ever since to this time.</P>
<P><HI>In which at diveres times</HI> Comenius <HI>was</HI> commanded from the Lord to write them; to translate them into the Latin Tongue, to divulge them speedily, through all publick places, and streets of the World; to translate the Bible into the Turkish Language; to com∣municate them to Kings, and Princes, and all Orders of men; and being backward and wavering, was still commanded, pressed, and threatned to go on, to write and publish them, and to invocate and to cry aloud upon all Nations of the Earth, in order to the accom∣plishment, and execution of these things, &amp;c.</P>
<P>All which this Adjunct of the Lords Prophet (not daring to tergiversate, or be disobedient to Gods call) has done, as well as he could, or is about to do; and durst not but do.</P>
<P>Accordingly therefore this excellent Man begins with the dedication and consecration of the whole to Christ Jesus him∣self, and an appeal to him, <HI>The Eternal Word, Wisdom, and Truth</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Hear us King of Glory! now crying unto thee, for thy Glory sake; and thou who art our Sun, shew us clearly to all under the Sun, as the clear Sun doth all things visible at noon day, what there is in these leaves; whether it be thy Light and Truth, or the frauds of thy black Enemy! Amen! Amen! Amen! O Light of the World! we appeal, in exposing this thy Cause, to the publick view of men, against the Prince of Darkness; we appeal from the Darkness to the Light; from the prejudice of fools, to the judge∣ment of the wise; from the rashness of the prophane, to the reve∣rence of the Godly; from the ill informed to the better informed; finally, from every humane Tribunal, to thy Tribunal it self! Thou King of Kings, in whose hands are the hearts of King, as Rivers of Water, to turn them which way thou wilt, give unto all that shall go about to judge of these things, a teachable heart, like <HI>Solomons▪</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="108"/>
to judge rightly of things, and to discern between good and evil.</P>
<P><Q>He that reads, let him understand!</Q></P>
<P>The next Dedication is, to all <HI>Kings and Powers,</HI> all <HI>Crowned Heads, and Vice-Gods</HI> of the Christian World, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If any thing yet remain to be done seriously about these things, this one thing is it, <HI>By an accurate and solemn Inquisition to examine,</HI> whether these things be truly so, or no; <HI>or whe∣ther humane figments only,</HI> cover'd with the <HI>Cloak of divine Reve∣lations?</HI> and that then, if any fraud be detected, <HI>the false wit∣nesses to be punished</HI> according to the Laws of God and man.</P>
<P>We fly therefore to your Tribunal, O Kings, for such a scruting! beseeching you all by the adorable name of God, to suffer your selves to be perswaded, that nothing under Hea∣ven greater can at this time be undertaken and performed by you, <HI>then this very question</HI> to be determined; <HI>Is it the Voice of God that sounds here, or no,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Seeing O Kings, Princes, Common-wealths! your duties are here set before your eyes, with wholesome Counsels, for the publick safty, be you</HI> intreated in the name of God, and by your own, and the Worlds salvation, <HI>this thing in the first place,</HI> to take these very Books into your protection, and command them to be exposed openly through all the Book-sellers Shops of your Kingdoms and Provinces, as freely as any other Books whatever of good note; Instilling into the Christian People, the fear of God, reverence of Kings, and amendment of life; <HI>As freely I say (as other Books of this nature) as the Book of the three men, and three spritual Virgins,</HI> Hermis Pastoris, Ugutine <HI>the Monk, Fryar</HI> Robert; <HI>and</HI> Hildegard, Elizabeth, <HI>and</HI> Mathilda, <HI>published by</HI> Jacob Faber <HI>at</HI> Paris, <HI>1513. (who all had Revelations and Visions like these,</HI> &amp;c.)</P>
<P>Hear O Kings, Princes, Common-wealths and every Po∣wer among Christian People, this Book which is offered to you stirs you up against no man, but exhorts you all in the name of God to do your duty in stopping the confusions brought in by
<PB N="211" REF="108"/>
Satan, and restoring the order instituted from God. As yet promising Benediction if you yet admit counsel, or denoun∣cing the last Wrath, Plagues and Destruction, if you yet harden your selves. Let the fear of the Lord therefore be with you, and deligently put in execution all things. It is your glory O Kings to be nursing Fathers, &amp;c. and also it is your Du∣ty to restrain any. Church, that, degenerating into Babylon, ex∣ercises fierceness &amp; cruelty: and if the Spouse of Christ, putting on a whorish dress, waxes wanton, to hate the Whore, and make her desolate and naked, and to eat her flesh, and burn her with Fire; God putting it into your hearts to do his pleasure. And no longer to give your Kingdoms to the Beast, till the Word of God be finished <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.—But behold in our times the words of all the Prophesies old and new are consummated, which the universal commotion of Nations, which you see, and the universal change of things, which you shall shorrly see▪ do witness. Ho! therefore take again unto you your power, and leave not your Scepters any longer, in a strange and wrong hand; I have commanded you, O Kings and Princes, that you your selves Govern; For you have even your name from me <HI>(Gods on the Earth)</HI> not from an Angel, or any creature, saies the Word of God to <HI>Drabricius,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But what must you do when you take unto you your power, O Kings? That very thing which the King of Kings (whose Mi∣nisters you are at this time) requires of you, TO REFORM THE WORLD AND ALL THINGS IN IT, THROUGH ALL NATIONS. For he who has long since, by the mouths of his most holy Prophets said, that he would make all things new, on you O Kings, as his Vicegerents, he confers this Honor, that this glorious Renovation be begun by your happy undertaking, and be done by your Co-work∣ing and Authority, through the whole world.</P>
<P>And then shall be the peaceable state of the World and of the Church in the Kingdom of the Messiah, promised in Para∣dise,
<PB N="212" REF="109"/>
<HI>in the destroying of the Devils Kingdom; And which all the Patriarcks looked for; and the Prophets prefigured in types; and the Apostles prophesied of; and the Prophets, and Prophesies of God ever since have declared; And which is so often reiterated</HI> in these Books, that Peace shall return to the Earth before the end of the World, <HI>with the divine benediction poured forth upon all.</HI> Drabricius Rev. <HI>107.</HI> Peace, such as never was the like from the beginning of things. Rev. <HI>149.</HI> when all Wayes, all Paths, all the Trumphets, all Books, all Voices, and Languages of all People and Nations shall agree in one angle of PEACE, and in one common CHARITY, <HI>Rev. 384.</HI> when the spiritual <HI>Jerusalem</HI> shall be built anew▪ so beautifully, that the ve∣ry times of <HI>Solomon</HI> may not be compared to these, <HI>Cotterus. 18.</HI> When the Messias shall plant new Hevens and new Earth, viz. new Churches and a new State, wherein dwells Righteousness.</P>
<P><HI>Which manner of things seeing they cannot but be an ex∣ultation to true Christians,</HI> and that this Book declares them; suffer it, <HI>as well, ye, O Roman Chatholicks (Princes) as others, whosoever love the coming of our Lord Jesus,</HI> suffer it to live, and to be taken for a publick Testimony <HI>of Gods being yet God,</HI> doing nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the Pro∣phets. And for a publick looking, or perspective-glass, rationally to view all things which are here doing in the Ages of the world. And for the last protestation and bearing witness of God, that it will not be his fault if a new deluge come upon the impenitent world. And then lastly, for a Publick Alarum, or Sermon-Bell, to Universal re∣pontance; and for the last Trumphet, after whose sound great Voices shall be made in the Heaven of the Church. The Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ, who now shall Raign throughout all Ages forever.</P>
<P><HI>Rather do this, O Kings and Powers, for the Honour of Christ, now taking unto him the Kingdoms of the World un∣der the whole Heavens. Learn who is the King of Kings, against whom the Heathen rage in vain, and the People ima∣gin</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="109"/>
<HI>a vain thing</HI> &amp;c. To whom the Nations are given for an inhe∣ritance, and the ends of the Earth for his possession; who shall rule them with a Rod of Iron, and shall break them as a Potters vessel. Understand now therefore O ye Kings, be instructed ye Judges of the Earth; serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce before him with trembling; learn discipline, lest his wrath at length be kindled, &amp; ye perish in the way; <HI>understand the mystery of these times, why the Nations are troubled and distrubed, and the Kingdoms declining▪ why the whole Earth is moved at the Voice of God; Namely, that</HI> these are the works of the Lord, and set as Prodigies and Signs upon the Earth, to take away War even unto the end of the Earth; To snap the bow in sunder, to break the Wea∣pons in peieces, and burn the sheilds with Fire▪ <HI>Therefore</HI> cease, O ye Kings, from War, &amp; <HI>see that the Lord is God, that God will be exalted in the Nations, that he will be exalted in the Earth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>O therefore Christian Kings take heed any longer to stand against the Prince of Peace, Christ, with your furious Arms, di∣sturbing and laying wast his Kingdom, w<SUP>ch</SUP> Kingdom you your selves are, as also <HI>the Universal Christian People</HI> committed to you. Or it shall come to pass that <HI>he will find some one to send upon you, even from the utmost East, to devour your Armies if you will not know the thoughts of the Lord, nor understand his counsel.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, Kings! begin to know from his <HI>Oracles old and new, founding in this very Book also,</HI> that the Lord be not inra∣ged against you and you perish in the way, But how?</P>
<P>First, <HI>By puting an end</HI> among your selves, and all Christian People, <HI>to WARS:</HI> because now is the time for the King of Peace to Raign, &amp;c. O Christian Kings▪ Princes, Common∣wealths, be Ministers of this Peacemaking King, and cease to be a reproach to Christ: <HI>For God will scatter the Nations that de∣light in War.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> All mutual PERSECUTIONS for Religion are pre∣sently to be laid aside also, which God never commanded; but Sa∣tan

began by <HI>Cain,</HI> and by <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Jezabel</HI> and the <HI>Babyloni∣ans,</HI> and <HI>Antiochus</HI> and <HI>Caiphas</HI> with their bloudy Hypocrites, and continued by <HI>Nero,</HI> and other <HI>Pagans.</HI> But among Christians, only the impious <HI>Arrians, dispairing to defend the depravity of their Opinion by Scripture,</HI> first attempted to usurp against the most manifest Doctrine and practice of Christ and the Apostles, and the holy Doctors and Martyrs of the Church, who had rather be kil∣led and devoured like Sheep▪ then kill and devour like Wolves.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Not to permit him neither, <HI>who usurping primacy in the Church, and supposing it to be defended by him▪ with Sword and Fire, hath now for some Ages raged;</HI> do not suffer him to continue his rage and cruelty; <HI>but that he also laying aside his Savageness, may become a Lamb of Christs flock, or an in∣nocent Lyon. Be mindful of that wise saying of</HI> Steven <HI>King of</HI> Poland, that God hath reserved three things to himself, <HI>1.</HI> Crea∣tion out of nothing, <HI>2.</HI> Foreknowledge of things future, <HI>3.</HI> Domi∣nation (or Lordship) over Consciences▪ <HI>Which the Roman Pope hath attempted to usurp, and without either any Divine com∣mand, or humane leave, hath dared to build himself</HI> a King∣dom over all Kingdoms of the World, and to maintain it by Sword and Flame. And to lord it over the Consciences of all men, even of his Brethren, the Bishops, and that which is more, of Kings them∣selves, who represent the divine Majesty on Earth. Which what is it else, but to climb into Gods Throne? which if ye, O Kings▪ the Vicegerents of Divine Majesty on Earth, continually tolerate, God protests that he will no longer tole ate. And to that end begins his Judgements against him, and you, and the world.</P>
<P><HI>4thly▪ That what the season of the present Broils and Trou∣bles of the world require of you,</HI> O Kings, <HI>that every one of you</HI> most solemnly proclaim to all your People universally publick Prayers, Fastings and amendment of life, and thereby true and ge∣neral repentance; after the example of the <HI>King of Nineveh. Be∣cause</HI> this is the time, <HI>of which Christ sayes▪</HI> that there shall be
<PB N="215" REF="110"/>
great Tribulation, such as hath not been from the begining of the World, nor ever shall be.</P>
<P>O ye Sons in high places! now God arises to judge the Earth and to take his inheritance in all Nations!</P>
<P>5thly. If upon universal repentance God spare you, <HI>a most solemn reformation and amendment of things is to be thought of.</HI> Inquire into the Books of the Lord, old and new; hear your <HI>St. Bridgets</HI> most excellent counsel, when <HI>St. Bernard</HI> inqui∣red the counsel of God from her. <HI>He that sat upon the Throne opening his mouth said, Hear all my enemies, living in the World!</HI> (because I speak not to my Friends, who follow my will) <HI>hear all Clergy men, Arch Bishops, Bishops, and all inferior orders of the Church! hear all Religious and Regulars of what soever order! hear Kings and Princes and Judges of the Earth! and all Mini∣stirs and Subjects. Hear Women, Queens, and Princesses, and all Ladies, Mistresses and Servants,</HI> and all of what soever order and degree, great, and small, that inhabit the world, these words which I, even I who have created you, now speak unto you &amp;c.—After complaining of all their sins, impieties and vices—Therefore I swear by my Deity, that if you dye in the state wherein you are, you shall never see my face, nor es∣cape my punishments, &amp;c.—Therefore return ye unto me with humiliations, and I will receive you graciously as Sons, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And therefore for such an universal and serious return, be∣cause serious and solemn thoughts once at length are to be en∣tred upon, counsel is given you <HI>even in these Books,</HI> O Kings! <HI>of convocating an UNIVERSAL COUNCIL out of all Christian People,</HI> Holily to conspire together in a common universal re∣pentance, and universal serious deprecating, and amendment of so great exorbitances now among us, &amp;c. and to return all from curiosities and niceties about Articles and Questions of Faith which hath distracted us, and from the many▪ by-paths of error which we are run into, and from earthly desires and lusts
<PB N="216" REF="111"/>
which have led us away into mutual strifes and Wars; unto the simplicity and puriry of the Christian Faith and Life. That all Christian Dissensions, Strifes, Hatreds, Wars, Devourings and Destroyings, may be changed into Concord, Peace, Love▪ Safety and Felicity; and to this, <HI>the only way is a COUNCIL truly universal, truly free, truly congregated in the Holy Ghost.</HI>—Arise, O Christian Kings! help things every where grown desperate! <HI>the Patronage of this Book belongs to Kings,</HI> because it comes <HI>in the name of the King of Kings, (and is print∣ed with priviledge of the King of Kings, and committed to the favor of all the Kings of the Earth every where to spread and divulge it) and contains nothing hurtful to any; but profitable, and most use∣ful to all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If you hear not these divine counsels, O Christians! the Lord will send more Plagues, Intestine Wars, Famine, Plague, Savage Beasts,</HI> i. e. <HI>Men worse then Beasts;</HI> so that Christians shall be more savage, and rage one against another more inhumanly, then Turks and Barbarians, because the condemnation of the great Whore is at hand.</P>
<P>—Not for our selves, O Kings and Princes! do we, the Publishers of this Book, require your protection thereof; <HI>but for your selves▪ and the Christian People, lest you perish from the fury of all the divine premointions. It is comfort and protecti∣on enough to us, from God, who can boldly say, with</HI> Hilde∣gardis, I have both spoke and writ these things not according to the invention of my own heart, or of any man; but as I have seen, heard, and perceived them in the Heavenly places (or visions) through the secret mysteries of God.—Therefore, hear ye! who preside in the place of God on Earth! undertake so to manage this cause of God against Satan or of Satan, against God <HI>(for so diffe∣rent persons interpret differently)</HI> that it may be ended, and none may err concerning these things. <HI>This lyes upon you upon a double right. 1st. because you are Kings. 2dly. Because you are the Churches nursing Fathers,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="111"/>
Therefore constitute, forthwith a Judgement, O ye who judge the Earth, wherein may be decided, whether our God, <HI>that hath pity towards us all in common,</HI> speakes here things profitable to his Reaple, or some Devil instil things hurtful.</P>
<P>—If the latter, that the false prophets and fainers of dreams may be put to death, and iniquity be taken away from the midst of the people; <HI>Deut. 13.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And,</HI> because the Eclesiasticks are ordinarily inclined to slay the Prophets, behold! we solemnly appeal from all Universities and Consistories to your tribunal, O Kings, and secular Powers. <HI>Like</HI> Jeremiah <HI>from the Priests to the Princes, and to the King him∣self; and</HI> Paul <HI>the Apostle, from the Council of the Priests, to the Political Judges,</HI> Felix, Festus, Agrippa, <HI>and lastly to</HI> Caesar <HI>himself.</HI></P>
<P>We beseech you undertake, 1st. the Patronage of this Book. <HI>Per∣mitting none to rage against it,</HI> till plenary examination and de∣lusion of the cause. For what, have these papers offended in recei∣ving these Lamentations, Mournings, and Woes? <HI>especially de∣nouncing no sad things to the people of God: But to</HI> Sodom, Egypt, Babylon, <HI>the World, Hell and the Devils afflicting the people of God.</HI> Nor perswade any Nation or any Man, any Re∣bellion against their Kings, but all Loyalty; that all things <HI>may return from all manner of confusions, into all manner of order and peace. Lastly, because</HI> This Book is one of them by which God Convocates the Kings of the Earth, from the four Corners of the World to reverence him, it is your part therefore O Kings! not to hinder but promote this Trumpet of God, if you would be Ministers of his Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> The publishers themselves of this Book commend themselves to your Patronage, O Gods, Protectors of the Earth! <HI>That you permit no unjust violence against them. As the Princes and the King himself did not against</HI> Jeremiah, <HI>and</HI> Baruch, <HI>nor the Tribune of the Band, and</HI> Felix <HI>Governor of</HI> Judea, <HI>against</HI> Paul. For it would be most unjust, by force to act any thing against
<PB N="218" REF="112"/>
him, who appealing to Justice, sets himself before the Judgement. <HI>As the Jewish Priests with their flatterers did against the Lord himself, and against</HI> Paul, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> We commend to you, O Powers of the Earth! the very cause it self pleaded in these Books, to be throughly examined; for in the name of one more powerful, these Oracles do come fulminating, your People, your Priests, and your Selves with your Princes, and ci∣ting all the inhabitants of the Modern World to a certain supreme invisible, yet terrible Tribunal.—For if the words which these Books denounce, be truly the words of God, it is more Glorious then any thing yet in the Church since the Apostles time. If Satanical Impostures, they are more terrible and fearful ones, then ever any have yet been. If figments of humane craft, nothing like hath ever yet come forth in any Nation by any humane wit. But whether this, or that, or the other, It is a matter most worthy of the care of Kings, that at length what it is may appear, <HI>whereunto serious Judgement is needful: not neglect, not contempt, not fury.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Hasten, O Kings! to know and examine what matter of things these are, before all the Plagues here denounced be powred forth up∣on your Kingdoms.—Deliver these things to wise men, and fearing God, and of publick spirits, seriously to be weighed. If you hear humane counsels, why not also these, which many wayes may appear to come by men indeed, yet not from men.</Q></P>
<P><HI>If any one say;</HI> Dare you broach, and vend these things for Prophesies undoutedly Divine? <HI>I will answer with</HI> Philip <HI>to</HI> Na∣thaniel, <HI>Come and see! For the offices and marks of true Pro∣phets are here (to declare to the people of God, fallen into abominations, their sins. To denounce wrath and punishment to the impenitent, and again Mercy and Grace to the penitent) this, and not another thing (for the main scope and end) you shall see, is done here. Only be sure to see, that you make your selves certain (which you may from the adjoyned histo∣ry) (1st.)</HI> That there have been really and indeed persons in this
<PB N="219" REF="112"/>
our Age who have written these things greater then any human wit. <HI>(2</HI>ly.) And that they were simple Idiots, not able to fain such things. <HI>(Act. 4. 13.) (3</HI>ly.) And Godly, fearing God, not willing to deceive. <HI>(4</HI>ly.) Incompassed with a cloud of Witnesses, that there could be no place for Impostures. <HI>(5</HI>ly.) Lastly, that many Godly and solid Divines, not in one Nation only, do give testimony that greater wisedom shines forth in these things then that they can be attributed to men; and that the whole work, is more sanctions and holy <HI>then that it can be attributed to Satan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yet lest we may seem to obtrude any private Authority on the Publick,</HI> we earnestly intreat a publick and solemn examina∣tion of these things, under your Auspicions beginnings, O Kings. And that as soon as may be, while witnesses are alive, who can give it on their Faith, that they have seen the fingers writing, <HI>viz.</HI> Things flowing forth or droping from the pen of the Seers, not what they themselves would, but what, (by themselves for the most part not understood) some certain invisible dictatour instilled into them; which also their own hand writing, <HI>viz.</HI> The originals themselves, kept in a certain place, further testifie.</P>
<P>The last thing we desire of you, O most serene Princes, is, that if these be Counsels divine, you would seriously purpose and resolve to obey and execute the divine Will, saying, All that the Lord hath said, we will do.</P>
<P>—Why may not these things be thus recommended, &amp;c. seeing no man brings them forth of his own daring; but they are offered in the name of God, who is the God of all, and takes care of all. It is the Law of Arms and custom of the Nations, that Trumpeters pass freely amongst the most deadly enemies, even ready to give Battel, bringing▪ the com∣mand of their Principals. Why may not he therefore be safe between the safeguards of your Majesty, O Christian Kings! <HI>who is your Interpreter from the King of Kings?</HI></P>
<P>But they who would perswade you that this Book is hurtful, stirring up to War, and Arms; betray their folly, malice, and
<PB N="220" REF="113"/>
impiety. Because it does not make; but (after the manner of all the Prophets) forewarn denounce, and threaten Wars and Desolations, without Repentence, and Amendment. And because none has ever drawn his Sword for the sake of this Book, when yet all people draw their Swords one against another; who is so blind yet, and besotted, as not to see his Arm stretched forth, out of whose mouth are denounced these things beforehand. Was <HI>Rome</HI> unwise, in permitting it to be cry'd through all the City, <HI>Hannibal▪s before the Gates?</HI> Cease Mortals to be mad and quite out of your wits. <HI>The voice of God and Angels, forewarning you from destruction, sound even in these Books.</HI>—</P>
<P>—The World is full of the Judgements of God. The present commotion of the World, and so many unlooked for Mutations, do not signifie nothing.—Lest therefore the Christian people be still so grosly ignorant as they are, of the terrible Judgements of God now in the world, <HI>viz.</HI> of their Causes, Manner, End, and Issue, do ye who preside over the people in the place of God, <HI>command, that among other helps ministred from the divine Power, that these Books also be publickly extant, and exposed to be sold, bought, read, and throughly consi∣dered and examined;</HI> being certain that it will be for the great use of Gods People, your Honour, and the Glory of God.</P>
<P>Yea, and read them your selves, and delay not to offer them to your Counsellours to be read and judged. Here is a thou∣sand times a greater business, then a Neighbouring War or Peace. It's worthy of all your <HI>Juncto's</HI> to consult of.</P>
<P>Let not, O Kings, the King of Kings seem to be so slighted by you; or his Messengers, (pretending at least) in his Name.—&amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>Believe it, most Serene Princes! nothing like to this Book, has the World had since the Apostles times.—</Q></P>
<P>The next is, <HI>to all the Angels of the Churches,</HI> Bishops, Pastors,
<PB N="221" REF="113" MS="y"/>
Doctors, all Divines, and Theologers, and all Eclesiasticks—where all prejudices of the Wise, and Learned, and Religious, against these matters are clearly removed, &amp;c.—</P>
<P>It hath pleased God in some Ages past to inspire before∣hand, Men and Women with a prophetick spirit (as in the Book called <HI>the Burden of the Church, and in the Catalogue of the Witnesses of the Truth,</HI> and in Fabricius's <HI>Tryal of Visions,</HI> are cited) <HI>and in our age to stir up others, and in greater numbers through</HI> Germany. <HI>Amongst whom seeing these three write what they are commanded, of that stupendous mutation of things in the World now at hand, and the Glorious Kingdom of Christ, Now, now to begin; And that indeed these are not fained, as may appear plainly from the adjoyned History. What hinders but</HI> that all these things also <HI>be known of you, O Presidents of the Churches.</HI> It is no burden to you to read humane commetaries upon the Scrip∣ture. Why do you neglect to know these, that as truly, as God lives, are not Humane?—Lay aside (or at least suspend for a time) the cushion of carnal security! Rather read again at∣tentively <HI>both the divine Book of the Prophets and Apostles▪ and also these new repetitions of the same things; and then if all things appear not a thousand fold clearer to you then through your false spectacles; then let it be free for you to take them up again.</HI>—Unhappy interpreters of the Scripture! who expresly deny what God expresly affirms in the Scripture; that <HI>the Lord does nothing, but he reveals his secrets to his Servants the Prophets. From whom therefore doth the contrary assertion, that God does all things without our privity, come? Expunge that out of your Bibles, or say God is not that Antient mankind-loving God, who takes plea∣sure to communicate his secrets to men.</HI>—I beseech you, O Theologers! be not more infidels to the world and works of God then <HI>Machiavil,</HI> suspected of some of Atheisme, as be∣fore quoted.—Take heed in the name of God, Theolo∣gers! to blind and hearden men, while you would seem to make them see. The Apostles have not said to the people of
<PB N="222" REF="114"/>
the new Law, <HI>Admit no more Prophesie;</HI> but he hath said, <HI>Quench not the Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, dispise not Prophesie, try all things,</HI> &amp;c.—O ye! that are appointed Watchmen upon the Walls of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> examin the state of your Churches; Whether they be truly called out of the world, or rather relapsed into the world, and become the verymost world indeed. If the whole matter were seriously looked into, perhaps you would see what heretofore so many holy men have seen, <HI>viz. Among Modern Christians almost nothing of Christ besides the name is found; for as much as</HI> (1st.) The humility of Christ is turned into haughti∣ness, from the highest head of the Church to the lowest. (2dly.) The Heavenly Kingdom of Christ, into all things that are Earthly. (3dly.) The Gentleness of Christ degenerated into fury and mad perversness, of butchering one another, that we are not now a tame flock of Tigers, Lyons, Wolves, Serpents; But a flock of Sheep, turned into Wolves, Bears, Dragons, Vi∣pers, greedy of nothing but to hurt one another in all the holy Mountains of God. (4thly.) Lastly, if it be true what a holy man said, <HI>Christ reigns in internals, Antichrist in externals, we are all now become Antichrists; Because none almost worship God in Spirit and Truth. All living in the flesh, seek to deceive God with a little paint and external daub of piety.</HI> Again and again, see what you do, O Theologers! lest if you will not admit these Preachers, God send you more terrible Preachers; Pro∣digies in Heaven and Earth, and Blood and Fire, and streams of Smoak; and Fears, and Pits, and Snares; and that like Peo∣ple like Priest, &amp;c.—<HI>If indeed they are Humane, or Satanical, you need not fear, but contemn them; but if truly from God, wo unto you, Guides of the people! who in obedience of your ordinary vocation most scornfully contemn these extraordinary things; that you account them neither worthy to be seen, or heard, orexamined.</HI></P>
<P>O Consecrated Heads to God!—Be not like the Preists and Prophets of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> drunken with Error, not knowing <HI>the Seer,</HI> and ignorant of the <HI>Judgement. Behold here, Seers! Be∣hold</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="114" MS="y"/>
<HI>an obscure question? Whether at this day there be Seers, or no. Examin both it and them. But Judge not according to outward ap∣pearance,</HI> but Judge Righteous Judgement sayes Christ. And what need you be troubled at them, they are but the things foretold in the Scripture. Of Tribulations to the wicked world, and Rest and Peace to the Church, &amp;c. <HI>Which if you can∣not bear with in these Books, expunge them out of the</HI> volumns of your Bibles. But if you can and ought to bear them there, bear them also here. That old and new may accord together. If you scruple, because they were unlearned, and Ideots, <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s counsel in full Council of the Pharisees, is moderate. <HI>Abstain from these men, and let them alone, for if this counsel or word be of men, it shall be brought to nought: but if it be of God, you cannot withstand it, lest perhaps ye be found fight<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s against God.</HI>—O Modern Councils, Synods, Consistories, Universities, suf∣fer the same words. Desist to prohibit this Book. For no Hu∣man wit can refute, nor no human force or power oppose this work of innovating the world, nor no humane goodness able to wish better things to mankind.</P>
<P>—<HI>If any dislikes this Counsel, and will try his strength, in overthrowing this work, let him also attempt to stop the dayly Rise and Set of the Sun; or the Flux and Reflux of the Sea; or the Winds from blowing hither and thither;</HI> But thou to thine own self, O man, art nor able to stop breathing in and out; And how wilt thou go about to restrain the Eternal Spirits breath∣ings and inspirations? Cease ye Sparks to contend with the Flame; ye Rivers with the Ocean; ye shall not prevail. <HI>Cease to befool men, by attributing to Man, or to Satan, what cannot be attributed, neither to Man nor to Satan,</HI> viz. to speak with the voice of God, and to seal his words with omnipotent virtue, to effect them; by shaking, to wit, the Earth, and the Sea, and the Islands, and breaking in peeces the Peoples, one by ano∣ther. Behold! It is the Lord, who both speaks and does!—</P>
<P>Let not the Protestants, and the Evangelicks, say they are
<PB N="224" REF="115"/>
reformed, and comeout of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and forsaken Antichrist▪ Alas! Alas! <HI>We lack not Popes, but</HI> Rome! the spirit of Anti∣christ has notforsaken us in all things, but only dispersed it self into more things. <HI>How many Universities, Doctors, Masters, Bishops, Pastors, we have, so many Popes.</HI> And every common man of the people, would be a Pope and Dictatour, above all Law and Discipline.—<HI>The Thunderbolts of God compre∣hended in these Books, do reach all corrupt Christendom. Let no par∣ty of Christians think that this Book is for them alone, to destroy all others.</HI>—The world is full of Babylonish works, therefore the whole World is <HI>Babylon.</HI> And every Kingdom, State, Ci∣ty, House, Church, and School, hath its <HI>Babylon.</HI>—Every Faction would build a Tower to climb into the Heaven of Glory, nor will cease from their own wayes and thoughts to bring them to pass.—Have we no Nimrods, hunters of Dominion and Lordship over others; and destroyers of the Christian Evangelick liberty?</P>
<P>—Antichrist is not hard to be found even among the Evan∣gelicks, who for liberty in Christ began to shake off, and would be now thought to have shook off the <HI>Antichristian yoak▪</HI> Either the Evangil, is not Evangil, or we are not <HI>Evangelicks.</HI> But there are <HI>reformed Evangelicks.</HI> Would there were, not in <HI>name,</HI> but in <HI>deed.</HI> For the Kingdom of God is not in <HI>Word,</HI> but in <HI>Power.</HI>—That Christians, as they now are, are of all which the Earth bears, most perverse (as who do all things against their professi∣on, believe against their Creed, live against their decalogue and Law, pray against their Lords prayer, hope against their hope) and before all other Nations <HI>to be reformed from the very foundation, or to be rooted up from the very foundation, may be here read.</HI> Alas! Alas! <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Mahomet</HI> have theirs more du∣tiful then Christ. For the Jews strictly observe (through all sufferings) their Ceremonies. Christ has commanded to wor∣ship God in spirit and truth only, and to love one another: and no ceremonies, and yet these, Christians are mad for; and
<PB N="225" REF="115"/>
quite regardless of the other. Charity alone was commended to us: not Ceremonies; yet these only urged. Among us perpetual fallings out, all sorts of oppressions, bloody Wars, and mutual horrid butcherings of one another, testifie that we have no charity. <HI>Mahomet</HI> forbad his, Wine; and they abstain. Christ forbad no good thing; and taught only Temperance, yet Christians live most intemperatly. He forbad his to dis∣pute of Faith; they dispute not, content with their blind faith. Christ taught to do, and not to say; (like the Phari∣sees) yet we do nothing, but scold about Faith; but lead, for the most part, prophane lives. <HI>Mahomet</HI> commanded to tole∣rate both Jews and Christians, and they do, molesting none for difference of Religion; But Christ hath in vain forbid us to pluck up the Tares before the Harvest; most deadlily raging against one another for Religion. And so all things, otherwise then he has commanded, by whose name we are called.</P>
<P>—O good Jesus! the whole universe of Christians seems to have conspired against thee! and they are first or prime in persecuting thee, who have the primacy in thy Church! &amp;c.</P>
<P>But they are not fulfilled say some (of the wise and learned) in the particulars.—Tis answered—In Prophesies (old and new) the scope of God is not to satisfie humane curi∣osity about this or that particular thing or person; But to in∣generate in mens minds, Terror in the Evil, Hope in the Good, and Repentance and Patience in all. And we are not primarily to seek, what may be future, as what is our duty; what God re∣quires or forbids, promises or threatens, and how to escape the Wrath, and to obtain Grace: which when men do not, God blinds them, <HI>so that to them Every Vision becoms a sealed Book, not able to be read; and the prophane find there nothing, but stum∣bling stones of offence, and darkness to blind them, and to grope in.</HI> That God fulfils things in his own time and way, though we mistake; That Instruments miscarry; and God defers; till the last, till the very hour of desperation, &amp;c. <HI>He that believes will not make hast.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="116"/>
—That in promises and threatnings God intends them conditionally, though spoken, as it were, many times, abso∣lutely. Of which enough already, &amp;c.</P>
<P>—O Protestants, Christians Reform'd; Evangelicks! Because <HI>most of you are contemners of extraordinary works of God, Visions, and Revelations, Charity compels to warn you, that you do not proceed to sin against God, and your own souls, by a pertena∣cious Judgement! condemning those things which you neither un∣derstand; nor that you might understand, ever made it your work, or took any leisure for.</HI> Run through all your Bibles, you shall never find God complaining of mens too much credulity to∣wards him, and his words, and other signs of his Anger or Grace: but the contrary. Shall we therefore now amongst so many Prodiges of Heaven and of Earth, and the cryes of God, Angels, Men, and almost of the very stones, and whilst the Signs of Gods Wrath dart forth every where into our very fa∣ces, fear to sin by too much credulity? <HI>Specially when by new Revelations no new opinion is suggested:</HI> only new incitements to weigh throughly, the ancient words and works of God, and to return into the ancient wayes of Faith and Obedience; with perpetual revoking us from our negligence, to the Scrip∣tures? <HI>And shall we yet go on, to ascribe these things rather to Sa∣tan, than give glory to God.</HI></P>
<P>—The conversion of the Jews, and the Nations unto God, with terrible foregoing Judgments and Plagues, <HI>is the Theme of this Book.</HI>—And therefore no cause, why any one should like to <HI>condemn this Book, or prohibit it to any to be read.</HI> For certainly <HI>Christians ought to rejoyce,</HI> that what all have pray'd in the name of Christ this sixteen hundred years, is now de∣clar'd to be at hand. <HI>Dissenters in opinion ought to rejoyce;</HI> Because an end of Dissentions is declar'd, and Universal Peace and Concord establishing, <HI>Protestants ought to rejoyce;</HI> Be∣cause God himself protests for them. <HI>Catholicks ought to re∣joyce;</HI> Because the Pale of the Catholick Church is promised
<PB N="227" REF="116"/>
to be extended, even to the ends of the Earth. <HI>Zealots ought to rejoyce;</HI> who have hitherto laboriously, might and main, persecuted those that erred in Faith; and dangerously (though with never so much pious Zeal) endeavoured to root out the Tares out of the Lords Feild; whilst, Behold!

<P><HI>This Book</HI> which is sent unto thy Majesty is <HI>written by the com∣mand of God, and published by the command of God, and sent to the heads of the World, by the command of God;</HI> That all may under∣stand, what is the last will of God, in the last Age, &amp;c.—</P>
<P>—These things could not be concealed from your Ma∣jesty; (of all others) because among the chiefest heads of the World, God hath set you in the chiefest place? and also be∣cause <HI>these Thunderbolts strike against you, amongst the first, and against your most</HI> Serene House.—Yet Grace is here offer'd to you.—See therefore what you do, <HI>most August Caesar!</HI> and that you may see, either <HI>read these things your self,</HI> or if too

<OPENER><SALUTE>Highest Priest of the Roman-Catholick Church.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Among other Prerogatives of the High Priest of the old Law, were (1.) <HI>To consult God in doubtful matters</HI>—(2.) <HI>To be supreme Judges in all Church-matters,</HI> with other chief Priests adjoyned, for ease of so great a burden. (3.) <HI>To restrain false Prophets.</HI> If therefore you, with your Colledge of Cardinals, by divne right, obtain the highest place in the Church, the same prerogatives by divine right are due also to you.—</P>
<P><HI>God was forced at length to send them Prophets extraordi∣nary, to warn Princes, Priests, and People of their duty.—They accounted them for false Prophets, Mock'd and Kill'd them.</HI> Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Thou who killest the Prophets, &amp;c.—God in this present Book makes complaints in the Ears of Angels, and men, against your prophanesses.—And threatens his utmost Judgments.—They are offered here to be read to the World, by command from God.—</P>
<P>—Do not, I beseech you, suspect these to be devised fictions of Man against you, or published out of a corrupt affection and desire
<PB N="229" REF="117"/>
to rejoyce at your destruction. They seek to deceive you, who seek to instill such suspicions.—We the publishers of these things, in the presence of the omniscient God, protest with <HI>Mordecai,</HI> that we for the Salvation of the Church, are ready to kiss even the soals of your feet.—</P>
<P>O Roman Pope! Let it pity you for your selves that you may hasten to prevent the wrath of the Omnipotent. Let it pity you for your Church, lest leaving it in Babylonish abomi∣nations, you deliver it up, to be scattered at length, by the Thunderbolts of God. Let it pity you for so many Christian People, by your obstinacy slid into so many Schisms and Here∣sies, that they may be reduced to the Unity of the Faith. Let it pity you for so many people out of the Pale of the Church, to whom a door of entrance is shut, through the confusions of Christians. O Pope awaken! O Pope rouze up out of the sleep of drunkenness and surfitting, wherewith your Flatterers have made you drunk and intoxicated you; calling you, <HI>Christs Vi∣car,</HI> and <HI>Infallible,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>—If there be none on Earth that dare speak true things unto you, <HI>behold monatory Voices from Heaven!—Read this Book, and take care to have it read by yours.</HI> Your Predecessours did not despise the gift of Prophesie in the Church, (as some now do) but proved all things, to hold fast that which was good. Therefore the Revelations of <HI>Hildegard, Bridget, Ca∣tharine,</HI> &amp;c. were judged to be without fraud, and admitted as worthy to be Canonical. <HI>Let the same thing be done to these new ones. Let them be submitted to a lawful examination; that it may appear what is needfal to be done; And it will appear that these last Revelations are as truly divine. And that Gods will is that the Kings resume their Scepters and Rule; and not the suc∣cessors of the Apostles.</HI> To spiritual men only spiritual things should belong. For that all confusion hath increased in the World, by submitting the secular power to the spiritual. And that all things may be reduced into a beautiful order, that it is
<PB N="230" REF="118"/>
the will of God, that a <HI>Councel be called</HI> by the Authority of Kings; That is, that the Christian People of all parties be con∣gregated, and there all controversies be heard, censured, weigh∣ed, decided, and terminated so; that by comman Jubilees of Heaven and Earth, may be sung; Glory to God on High, on Earth Peace, good will towards all men.—O Modern Ro∣man Popes! oppose not your selves as your predecessors have hitherto done, never daring to submit their cause to a General Council; <HI>Do you dare:</HI> why should you not? If your power over the whole Church, and all Bishops, and over all Kings too, be of God—<HI>O Roman Pope! why do you rage so, against all your Modern Monitors, whether Doctors, or Teachers, and Pro∣fessors of the Truth? or whether Bishops, Pastors, or whole intire Churches?</HI> or <HI>whether Kings, Princes, and Commonwealths?</HI> or <HI>whether New Prophets?</HI> &amp;c. Nor are the Modern, the only or the first; This thousand years there have been the same complaints and lamentations; not only privately, but by pub∣lick cryes, both by voice and writings—And God hath all along admonished you by extraordinary Prophets of your own, and from among your selves. Some ye have killed; some ye have persecuted; the rest you would not hear, or under∣stand or regard. As <HI>Johannes de Rupescissâ,</HI> and others whom you imprisoned. <HI>Mancinellus</HI> whose hands and tongue you cut off. <HI>Hus, Savanarola,</HI> and others, whom you burnt. Al∣though even some also you had canoniz'd and their Prophe∣cies, and externally honour'd for Saints, who will witness a∣gainst you.—</P>
<P><HI>O</HI> Alexander the seventh, <HI>to you I appeal by name, and most humbly pray you</HI> to admit these words or speeches. As God lives, and your soul lives, I seek nothing in this Book, or this new Edition thereof, but that the Christian People with all their Prelates, may prevent the last Wrath of God. <HI>They are serious things, and concern the Christian Peoples safety, or destru∣ction. By the tremendous Name of God, I pray, do not set them at nought.—</HI></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="118"/>
<HI>Peter</HI> could erre; why not <HI>Peter</HI>'s successor? <HI>Peter</HI> could be admonished of his error by Collegues; Why not also <HI>Peters</HI> successors? <HI>Peter</HI> did not bear disdainfully his admonition, yea sharp rebuke; nor let <HI>Peters</HI> Successor.—</P>
<P>—Therefore <HI>Alexander,</HI> highest Priest! suffer something to be said—I will deal plainly with you in the name of co-Brothers, all the Bishops of the world, and in the name of the whole Christian People—<HI>whether these three Prophets of ours, were truly sent of God and commanded to speak, what they spake.</HI> It is not enough to deny; but come to examine.—Whilst therefore sad things are here denounced against you, O Ro∣man Pope! <HI>in these Books, do not I beseech you suspect any com∣pany of men have here conspired against you. Whether in jest and sport, as your Pasquin and Morphory at</HI> Rome; <HI>or in earnest. Examine before you contemn.</HI></P>
<P>—<HI>Thou, O Roman Pope! yet be entreated. If you are resolved to imitate</HI> Ahab, <HI>the slayer of the Prophets; yet at least imitate his prudence and policy;</HI> i. e. Be not more cruel towards these three Prophets speaking to you, and the word by the command of God; then <HI>Ahab, towards his three,</HI> Elias, Anony∣mus, <HI>and</HI> Micheas. <HI>1</HI> Kings. ch. <HI>18. and 20, 22.</HI> Elias <HI>requi∣red all</HI> I srael <HI>to be gathered together, to see whether God was God, or</HI> Baal. Ahab <HI>consented, was himself a spectator.</HI> You have sought us, O Roman Prelates! (whom you thought disturbers of your affairs,) through all Nations and Kingdoms by your Per∣secutions and Inquisitions. But they, behold! ready of their own accord, by command of God, set themselves before you, to try, whe∣ther God be God, or <HI>Baal.</HI> And that all the Christian People be congregated into Council, to this spectacle. Stand to this therefore. Admit a just request. Gather a Convention together. Behold the event!—<HI>All your Counsellors, with your false prophets, promise happy</HI> Omens <HI>to you, as they did to</HI> Ahab. But behold here some <HI>Michea's,</HI> who have heard another thing. Are they not to be heard also? <HI>Josaphat perswades.</HI> Nor let him who is not more
<PB N="232" REF="119"/>
obdurate then <HI>Ahab,</HI> refuse. The event will shew, whence these things come. And it is just, that all People be called as Witnesses. It ought to appear plainly by the publick testimony of the world, if there be any true God, and true Prophet of the true God, or no. We send these words, as <HI>Micheas's,</HI> to all people, that they may be heard of all.—<HI>O</HI> Alexander <HI>Pope! humble thy self in Sackcloath, and Ashes; and command all in your great</HI> Nineveh, <HI>so to do; If yet perchance at last, God may return, and pardon, lest ye perish.</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>Pope</HI> Alexander! <HI>from the beginning of the World,</HI> the Light of the divine Word, <HI>hath never so clearly shone,</HI> nor so many Prodigies <HI>broak forth in Heaven and Earth,</HI> nor so many extraordinary Revelations and Prophesies; Nor so many and so universal Commotions of the Nations, <HI>and Destructions, and Ca∣lamities following them, and to follow.</HI> Wo unto you, if you lead the World to despise all these things.—Be moved at the sight of this Book!—<HI>O Pope, be but in deed what you are in name, The Head of the Church! Successor of the Apostles! Vicar of Christ! and all will be well and safe.—Lay down the Arms of the World. Put on the Arms of the Church; of the Apostles; of Christ. You shall as certainly overcome as they overcame—Pope</HI> Alexander <HI>7</HI>th! <HI>wise Pope! command</HI> St. Hildegards <HI>Vision to be shown you.—And you will see,</HI> nothing is said against you here; but what hath been said by your own Saints and Prophets before. <HI>And for that reason never harden your self against</HI> so great obtestations of God,—both old and new. Although you burn these Books; or reject them amongst the prohibited Books, or take no notice of them; yet they will have their effect, for which they are sent.</P>
<P>Whosoever of you, O Cardinals, Bishops, Prelats, Fathers of the society! have access to the Pope, perswade him, <HI>not to be too hasty, to condemn this Book</HI> (that perswades only such things) <HI>as an Heretick or Phanatick Book.</HI> Let him rather read, or those that are sincere amongst you give it him to read, &amp;c. We read
<PB N="233" REF="119"/>
your Books of all kinds, <HI>even your Revelations from God.</HI> Why not you also, these things which ours, the same God, (for we have no other) hath vouchsafed to reveal to us? And per∣swade him that he may say to himself and you, Let us search our wayes, and turn unto the Lord.—To whom for a final determination, <HI>Whether this be his Word or anothers, we must ne∣cessarily appeal on both sides, as</HI> Elias <HI>and</HI> Micheas <HI>did.</HI> But <HI>Ahab</HI> and the People stood still.—</P>
<P>If you persist, and refuse to follow the Examples of <HI>Christ</HI> and his Apostles, what will follow? Nothing else will remain, then either to oppose new Counsel, more crafty than former; or new and greater force: But either, or both, alike in vain. As <HI>Caiphas</HI> the High-Priest of the Jews, did use both in vain; In whose footsteps if it please you still to insist, Do what he did; Convocate Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Abbats, Doctors, and propound to them, How no means hi∣therto used, avail any thing. And that now moreover, a new danger is arisen, <HI>from new Revelations published,</HI> if they be ad∣mitted for Divine; <HI>which deliver the power of Judging and Re∣forming the Church unto Kings. Reformation (that unseen Re∣formation) heretofore attempted by Paedants only, or certain Monks (Waldus, Wickliff, Hus, Luther, &amp;c.) or a few Princes and Kings, and not united among themselves, yet made you grievous work for some Ages: But what shall we now do, if Kings themselves unite with their Counsels and Forces, and set upon the work?</HI> We must therefore look about us quickly, and take new Counsels; yea we must whet the Arms of both Swords, and call Fire and Water, and Halters, and Gibbets, and Daggers, and Potions, &amp;c. to help, &amp;c. and ends (with that which is the sum of all these Revelations; if he hath not leisure to read them at large) either to repent, or to perish. It is necessary, either a Total Reformation, or a Total Destruction, one of the two.</P>

<P>—But are these things certain? or, are they not fables, contriv'd and composed by the Art of some ingenious and witty to deceive?</P>
<P><HI>Tis answered.

<P>Machiavillian Politicians, Atheists, <HI>imagining the World to be ruled by Humane Counsels,</HI> have laughed at these as Phana∣tick things. But behold!

If any shall say therefore, <HI>This Book is the Trumpet to Wars.</HI> It must be answered, 'Tis so indeed; but <HI>the Book of the Wars of the Lord,</HI> as the <HI>Revelation</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> and the Book of all the Prophets; yea, and the Book of the Gospel it self per∣haps, according to that of Christ, <HI>Do you think that I came to send Peace on Earth,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="2">2. The Wars of the Lamb against the Beast already here∣tofore sounded. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1714.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Wars of the holy Spirit of God against all errone∣ous and unclean spirits in the Earth. <HI>Zach.</HI> 13. 2.</P>
<P>—<HI>I say, That</HI> here is the Revelation of the Revelation of Saint John, <HI>which hath distracted so many Commentators, differing among themselves.</HI>—Therefore this Book is a new Commen∣tary upon the old Revelations of St. John; not a Humane, but Divine.—The former Edition was exposed to light with doubting and trembling, and for censure only: This freely and confidently; not now so much to judge whether these things be Divine; as to execute them as Divine, for warning to the World. <HI>Now therefore</HI> we lift up our voice as a Trumpet, <HI>That they may hear who had not heard, and they may believe who had not believ'd; and may see with their eyes, and handle with their hands, who had not as yet foresaw by Faith, That God is in the midst of humane affairs,</HI> and does sometimes speak to men; doing nothing, but he reveals his secrets to his servants the Pro∣phets.—<HI>There is need now of no vails, no secret muttering.—Now all must needs hear, both far and near, even to the utmost ends of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Be admonished therefore, O all ye, into whose hands this Book shall come, that ye <HI>do not read it without St.</HI> John's <HI>Revelations, and without divers reflexion to those things which are now a doing in the World.</HI> And then <HI>the very blind cannot but see that it is God that here speaks, not man.</HI> And that it is God
<PB N="239" REF="122"/>
who stirs up the Nations of the World one against another; not this or that man predicting such things; or not one ano∣ther themselves. And that it is God who comes to chastize the Christians in his Indignation; not the Turks and the Tar∣tars. And lastly, that God himself is about to reform his Church; not the King of <HI>France,</HI> or any other.</P>
<P>Cry unto God, O Christian People! Shew pitty, O God! Prevent blindness, prevent stupidity. We are thy People. Permit not that all Visions be unto us as a sealed Book which cannot be read. Do as thou hast promised; that the day is coming in which the Deaf shall hear the Word of the Book; and the eyes of the Blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness; In thy Light beholding light. And whosoever thou art that readest these things, say with blind <HI>Bartimeus, Lord that I may see!</HI></P>
<P>Take <HI>this Book into your hands, O Christians of all parties!</HI> and <HI>know that these things here offered, are like to those Ancient ones,</HI> the burden of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the burden of <HI>Moab,</HI> the burden of <HI>Damascus,</HI> the burden of <HI>Egypt.</HI>—Whoever art wise, despise not to be forewarned, and <HI>lay aside vain wrath against these things.</HI> If these threatnings came from man, they might be contemned, or the Plot counterplotted: But if from the terrible God who cannot be resisted, take heed!—But whether it be himself that speaks here, he will undoubtedly know whoever reading all these things (together with the premised Informations, and the conjoyned History thereof) attentively with the fear of God; and comparing all things with the events to which they dispose themselves, shall purpose not to strive with the Fates, and the President of the Fates. If any one be resolved the contrary, namely to think <HI>Antient and new Prophecies an antiquated thing no longer to be heeded,</HI> and the World now to be governed either by Fortune, or Chance, or humane Counsels only, let him go on to stop his ears, shut his eyes, and harden his heart past all remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="123"/>
And lastly, he gives a large, sober and judicious Apology for the whole <HI>Book,</HI> and <HI>Publication:</HI>—Let them favou∣rably hear me, All who fear God. As for me, if for fear of men I do not what God and Conscience command, I expose my self to his wrath, into whose hands it is intolerable to fall.—If new hatreds, calumnies, persecutions attend me for this new Edition, let the will of God be done! I commit my self into his hands, either to protect me, or to deliver me up into their hands who seek my soul. I am full of dayes (beyond <HI>Davids</HI> age of man) and full of the miseries of life; so that it is pleasure to say, It suffices; Lord take away my soul!—Away! let us not be wise above God! And <HI>While he commands to speak, let us speak, whether any one will hear us or not.</HI>—Wo unto the soul, if seeing the sword, for fear of men he blow not the Trumpet.—I come unto thee, <HI>O Queen of Churches, the Roman, do not, I beseech ye, suspect this Trumpet of God through any private grudge towards you, to sound as it were a charge,</HI> either to stir up peoples hatred towards you, or warrs against you—for it does not sound to war, but a retreat.</P>
<P>Men Catholicks, and all that fear God, hear! <HI>Let any one of you reade this Prophetick Volumn a thousand times, he shall find it hath no other scope than what hath in past Ages been ex∣pressed by the mouth of</HI> David <HI>and all the holy Prophets;</HI> name∣ly, that God will not alwayes endure our Babylonish confusi∣ons, and mutual <HI>Cain-like</HI> hatreds and slaughters; but some∣time totally make an end thereof, in the last dayes, &amp;c. <HI>Isa.</HI> 2. <HI>Mich.</HI> 4. <HI>Zech.</HI> 9. and a thousand other places, aswell in the antient Prophets, and Apocalyptical writings of the Apostles, as in these revealed in our ages.</P>
<P><HI>I protest therefore before God and his Angels, and Heaven and Earth, that this Book is not published with an intent to injure any one; and that it is not to be taken for a scandalous Libel, but an Historical Book, and Monitory to all Christians without difference:</HI> That all may desist from mutual hatreds, persecutions, slaugh∣ters,
<PB N="241" REF="123"/>
butcherings, &amp;c.—<HI>They are not dehortations Humane; but of God himself, immoveably founded in the antient Oracles, reiterated only upon new occasions.</HI> The sum of which is, that all things must be reformed among Christians, or all must pe∣rish. Mother of the Churches throughout the West! Why dost thou rage so against thy Sons, admonishing and exhorting thee to repentance, and amendment? When this Book was quite ready, and nothing of this Apology thought on, some Friends yet solliciting its suppression, my Conscience did then dictate, that it was <HI>better to obey God, rather then Men;</HI> and I cryed unto the Lord; But he taught me to take unto me this Buckler, and to lay open my heart before the eyes of Men, <HI>as it is known in the sight of the Heart-knower.</HI>—</P>
<P>But I now ceasing here to speak unto you, O Christian People! <HI>Invocate thee, who art God, for witness; that I have done, what thou hast commanded, and nothing else.</HI> Nor for any other end, then that thy last Will might become known to them, to whom thou hast commanded it should. Nor have prefaced these things on any other hopes, then that men, ra∣tional Creatures, might learn to discern and judge of things.—Perform, O God! what thou hast promised; <HI>Shew, that thou hast spoken these things, and we compelled to write.</HI> And if any one would hurt us, be thou a Wall of Fire unto us, as thou wast to <HI>Eliah.</HI> (as <HI>Dabricius</HI> speaks, <HI>(Rev.</HI> 416.) Give into the Hearts of Kings, to do what thou hast commanded, by giving these things to Arbitrators, to weigh and consider; But to such as are of a single heart, and have a light kindled by thy Law, and Prophets; a light burning and shining in truth. <HI>(Rev.</HI> 259.) Give also, that very Kings, and Princes, with Queens, and Priests, and all the People, may so read these things, as <HI>Josias</HI> the King, with his Princes, the words of thy threatnings, to tremble at thy Judgements, and re∣pent. <HI>(Drabr.</HI> Rev. 325.) Thou thy self, O Lord! work in those, to whom the voice of thy Trumpet shall reach, that
<PB N="242" REF="124"/>
thy Word may be as fire, consuming the Abominations of Desolation. <HI>(Rev.</HI> 559.) And whomsoever these voices of thine shall sound about, that together thy Coelestial Light may shine about! That there may be none so blind with Zeal, nor a <HI>Saul</HI> so obstinate in his Opinion, that may not fall down prostrate, and cry, Lord! What wilt thou have me to do! Seeing the Abyss of thine Anger, to have opened it's Jaws, to swallow up false Christians, except they repent▪ <HI>(Rev.</HI> 325.) But if even yet, they will not permit thy Wit∣nesses to speak, but will command them to hold their peace, will stop their ears; it will be high time that thy self, O Lord! speak for thine own self! Speak therefore! speak, by the work it self; by accomplishment of the Predictions; that they may understand that it is Thou who speakest, and doest▪ Bring forth thy Witnesses, as thou hast promised, whom the World may be full of. <HI>(Rev.</HI> 569.) O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hearken, and do! Defer not, for thine own sake, O my God!</P>
<P>In his Appeal, before his Epitome, such passages as these occur.</P>
<P>O thou Adorable! dwelling in the Heavens! give testi∣mony, that <HI>Nothing is here offered unto men in thy Name, which is feigned of men, and onely covered over with thy Name:</HI> That so if this Light of Revelations (for so the Book is called) be lighted and kindled by thee in thy Church, it may be as in∣extinguishable, as the light of the Sun and Stars in the Firma∣ment: But if otherwise, and a trap be laid for thy Christian People, <HI>bring to naught the fraud, with the Zeal of thine own self, O Lord God of</HI> Zebaoth! That as every Plant which the Heavenly Father has not planted, may be rooted up; so eve∣ry light which the Father of Lights, has not kindled, may be put out. Yea as <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> offering strange fire be∣fore the Lord, which was not commanded, but were con∣sumed with fire from the Lord: <HI>So let the like Example be now</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="124"/>
<HI>shewn, O God! That if any have dared, and do dare to offer the figments of their own brain, in the Name of the Light of thy Re∣velations, they may fall down dead in thy Presence, and the Pre∣sence of all thy People.—By thy commands, these things are brought to pass.—Behold! we again speak, seeing thou com∣mandest and drivest us with terrors! The words received, not from men: but from thee; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</HI>—Never man spake as Christ; and <HI>never spake Satan as these, even as God speak by his Prophets.</HI> (1.) Thundring against the sins of men. (2.) Denouncing Punish∣ments, and whence, except they repent. (3.) Offering Grace to the Repentant. Which three so holy things, Satan neither will, nor can counterfeit. And for men, they are a∣bove the wit of man; especially of these men. <HI>Kotterus,</HI> an <HI>Artizan,</HI> and most simple Ideot. <HI>Christina,</HI> a young Virgin, by her Age uncapable of such things. <HI>Drabricius,</HI> an old doting Man; (as his Enemies traduce him;) <HI>Do they not then speak things more then humane?</HI> (Therefore being neither Humane nor Diabolical, they must certainly be Divine.) But I cease to contend with Arguments, whether these things be Divine, and not Humane, committing it to every mans own Conscience and circumspection, and the divine Illuminati∣on. For as none can convince by Arguments, whether it be Day or Ninght, except the Sun be risen, to cause day, and men open their eyes: So none can better demonstrate, that God speaks, then God himself speaking, and man attending to God; and that the Voice of God be sealed also with Om∣nipotent Effects. That the very things may speak for them∣selves, and their Author. (By the light only we see the Light, and things done by day, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>Wilt thou know therefore, O Man! <HI>whether God speaks here? three things are to be done.</HI> (1.) To Pray, Lord! open mine eyes, that I may see whether it be thou that speakest, or a Spirit of Delusion. (2.) To hearken to the Voice of him that
<PB N="244" REF="125"/>
speaks. That is to know and examine all things in order, and not be ignorant of the particulars, and all circumstances. (3.) To look about circumspectly, whether any such things be now a doing in the World or no, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If for all this any one likes not <HI>to read this Book,</HI> let him do as he likes best. Let him turn away his eyes, stop his cars, harden his heart, &amp;c. And if he will, <HI>add furies also, let him rear the Book in pieces, cut it, burn it,</HI> as <HI>Joakim</HI> did, <HI>Jer.</HI> 36. Or fall on Gods Witnesses, as on <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> or <HI>Baruch,</HI> or <HI>Ste∣ven,</HI> &amp;c. But whosoever thou art, that art wise, take heed of Precipices. <HI>'Tis dangerous to meddle with Prophetick Matters. 'Tis most safe counsel to abstain from these men.</HI>—Specially the Persons that undergoe and tell such Dreams, Raptures, Apparitions, being otherwise innocent and harmless. Rather say as the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of <HI>Paul, We have found no evil in this man: But if a Spirit have spoken unto him, or an Angel, let us not fight against God.</HI> He wages War with God, who by force seeks to oppress the Spirit of Prophesie. But if by no obte∣stations we can obtain moderation with men, I humbly throw my self prostrate with this whole Cause at thy feet, Lord Je∣sus! who art constituted Judge of quick and dead; distin∣guish betwixt, and pronounce with thy true Mouth, for the Truth, against a lie!—</P>
<P><HI>But there are so many frauds and cheats in the World, will some say; But however the Apostle bids,</HI> Despise not Prophe∣sie. Try the Spirits whether they be of God or no. Try all things, hold fast that which is Good.—</P>
<P>We will but add lastly, (having gone so far already, beyond our intent at the first, in these Apologetick Discourses and Collections) the most weighty passages, out of their solemn Prayer, and appeal to Christ, in that publick form, made for the tryal of <HI>Drabicius,</HI> by the <HI>forecited dreadful Oath;</HI> All for the further evidence and confirmation of the whole mat∣ter, with the candid and ingenuous Reader; and to give the
<PB N="245" REF="125"/>
greater authority, if it may be, to such a prophetick Histo∣ry, before we pass to the Prophesies themselves.</P>
<P>—We know the impudence of that Enemy, who is so bold as to mix himself with thy Sons, and to counterfeit an Angel of Light, when he is but the Prince of Dark∣ness; and to offer himself to be a Leader and Counsellor to men, when he is the worst and vilest Betrayer, and so to colour over his Prophets and Apostles, as to appear thy Pro∣phets and Apostles. Yea, and to boast and set off himself for thee; Antichrist for Christ. But we, alas! are too slow and heartless to apprehend his so many Impostures, un∣less thou comest in to relieve, O Helper! He will confound, subvert, overturn all things. But where shall remain thy <HI>Elo∣gium,</HI> O Son of God! that thou appearedst to destroy the works of the Devil. <HI>Appear therefore! O appear unto us al∣so! in the present decision and danger we now suffer from Satan!</HI> sowing among us Tares of scandalous Doctrine and Life, <HI>and of false prophets, or else false zeal against them.</HI> Ah! suffer us not to be befooled, this, or that, or the other way, for thy Holy Names sake! Let the Father of Lies execute and per∣form the work of Seduction, and lying wonders in them that perish; who have not believed the Truth. We thy humble Flock, who have chosen to adhere to thy Word, <HI>Let thy holy Spirit preserve us from the seduction of Errors!</HI>—Or if it please thee to try us; yet let it not be as to our souls.—Whether as to Goods, Health, or Life it self, (as to <HI>Job, Paul,</HI> and the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Job,)</HI>—thy Will be done. But deliver not our Souls to his power, we beseech thee! to wit, an Understanding and Will, <HI>to befool, puzzle, and per∣vert us. That we may neither receive the works of Satan for Gods; as</HI> Ahab; <HI>or abominate the Work of God for Satans;</HI> as the Pharisees, who deluded by Satan, execrated Christ as Satan; by it thereby blaspheming God himself.—</P>
<P><HI>Behold! behold! he goes on to sow the Tares of so many scandals amongst us also, who suffer for thy Name!</HI> Also
<PB N="146" REF="126"/>
false Prophesies, as we fear, or false Lights, to discern whether truly Divine, and from thee.—<HI>But thou, O Lord! with whom is light, and who alone seest all things, and alone knowest to distinguish Error from Truth; Why hold hold'st thou thy peace at these things? Why hold'st thou thy peace so long, so many years?</HI> Is now thy Zeal or Fire wanting to thy Clouds, to consume those that bring strange fire into thy Presence; or to shew who is thy true Prophet, or not; in the sight of all thy People. Is there wanting a Sword to restrain <HI>Paschur,</HI> the Smiter of thy <HI>Jeremiah's;</HI> or a blow to strike <HI>Hananias</HI> the false Prophet dead. <HI>(This year thou shalt die, and he did so,</HI> Jer. <HI>28. 16, 17.)</HI> Or captivity to lead away <HI>Amazias,</HI> the Informer against thy <HI>Amos.</HI></P>
<P>O Lord, the Dominator! If any Crafts-master and Contriver of Cheats, have befooled any one amongst us, so as to reckon his sad trifling Songs, or mournful Ditties, for true Revelations Divine, and to vent them to others, deceiving, and being decei∣ved; Succour him! succour the rest of us! <HI>that we may be as thy Mouth, separating the precious from the vile. But now,</HI> if any one of us, willingly and knowingly, give up himself, as an Instrument to Satan, and in thy Name, exercises impostures; Lord! make it manifest; and set forth such a Messenger of Sa∣tan for an Example to the World. <HI>Thou sparedst not the An∣gels that proudly sinned; neither spare these who imitating Satanical pride, draw away themselves, and others, into Pre∣cipices of destruction.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side, forsake not thy holy <HI>Jeremiahs,</HI> or <HI>Mi∣chea's,</HI> that are bruised with a petulant Tongue or Hand; or thrust into Prison: But all <HI>Paschurs,</HI> their Smiters, fill with fear on every side, every where, that their eyes may see the truth of thy Words.—</P>
<P>And indeed accordingly, God begins to speak for himself, (so that there is no need for man to speak for him more.) <HI>But where, and how?</HI> First, in the very <HI>Act of</HI> Drabricius<HI>'s Oath.</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="126"/>
For there was this <HI>Dilemma. If I have not spoken thy Words, O God! smite me in pieoes in the sight of all.</HI> If thine; shew, that they are thine, by fulfilling their truth. But behold! he doth not yet sinite him; (but suffer him to live very old) and on the contrary hath smote several of his Adversaries with death, according to the threatnings of God by him; and particularly one of the Pastors, a new one, among those Ex∣iles, who became a new Adversary to him. Therefore he gives testimony, that they are not others words. Secondly, In the Events themselves, much fulfilled, or daily fulfilling, &amp;c. Therefore what need of more words? &amp;c. But to leave all to God, who alwayes accomplishes his words, first, or last, in his own time, and his own way.</P>
<P>And thus we have at length brought a long-boding pream∣ble to an end; which hath exceeded indeed the bounds due to this place: But being in, we knew not how to give of, nor forbear such material passages, for the gaining greater cre∣dit to the ensuing Relations; and which was almost absolute∣ly necessary, to prevent prejudice and offence against things of so strange a nature; That so the Courteous Reader might the better take in good part the History, what ever heed he give to the Prophesie.</P>
<P>For we divine full well, that most will but look upon them, as the Dreams or Ravings of two old doting Seniors, now going down with their gray Hairs in sorrow to the grave. But be they of God, Man, or the Devil, they are the strang∣est things that ever yet appeared on the Stage of the World. And for that end only we relate them here, as observable Hi∣story, and matter of Fact; and thereby, if they prove true, the future State of <HI>Europe.</HI> And have further thought fit to represent the chief and most material Things, that <HI>Comenius</HI> has recorded in behalf of their Truth and Verity, or wrote by way of Apology for them. Which having done, we leave it to Time and Providence, to discover and prove them,
<PB N="148" REF="127"/>
either Verities or Delusions; But however, whether one or the other, most Remarkable. And yet one would think mul∣titude of years should teach wisdom, and make the experi∣enced past all such dotages. <HI>Comenius</HI> is aged, learned, so∣ber and godly, known of all men; <HI>hath had above forty years knowledge and tryal of these matters,</HI> as has been said before; And has observed and delivered <HI>more convincing Arguments for their Divinity, than any has, or can, against them.</HI> Has had the Testimony of the most illuminated Divines of Chri∣stendom. Has found none to convince or condemn them of Imposture, upon <HI>fair tryal and examination; which most rea∣sonable request, is all that is desired in the face of all the Christian World, and ought not in justice be denyed them;</HI> Till which let all men be silent before God. For 'tis better to suspend Judgment, than pass it rashly. None of these things have been done clandestinely, or managed inconsiderately. <HI>They stand ready for the Bar of Mans Tribunal; and in the mean while appeal to God.</HI> If they must needs be reproached for these things, sayes <HI>Comenius,</HI> and that Christian People will sin a∣gainst God and their own Souls; for their parts, they will like <HI>Jeremy, appeal to God and Men.</HI> First, And above all things, <HI>to God, the Supream Witness, Judge and Avenger of this Cause; and then to those who are in the place of God on Earth;</HI> both Governors of States, and Churches too, hum∣bly to plead this Cause before them.—</P>
<P>Now if they be of Man, or the Devil, none ought to fear them, but contemn them. And therefore none should be of∣fended that they are thus brought to light, and into English. For we intend them here, only as a most wonderful History of the present Age, not to be passed over without taking no∣tice of. For, be they true, be they false, they will be found exceeding useful to the Age, and to Posterity.</P>

<P><Q>Certainly, it must needs be confessed, That these things are once to be, or have already been, or God to be accused of a lie.

<P><Q>I confess that I also was in that Opinion, that there were no Revelations of Divine Authority since Christ and his Apostles; and so also I taught. But after that I read these things more accurately, I use to say, That greater wisdom shines forth in them, then that men can be their Authors, much less those from whom they proceed: And that they seem to be things of a better Nature, and so constantly continned such for many years; then that they can be attributed to the Devil.</Q>

<P>Now for these Prophesies, we shall first give you the scope and sum of them beforehand in general, and then come to the Revelations and Visi∣ons themselves, in particular.</P>
<P>The utmost scope of all these Revelations is, according to the manner of the Ancient Prophets. (1.) To shew unto Christians the manifold sins and aberrations wherewith they have provoked, and do provoke God; and sad Lamentations thereupon. (2.) To discover the Causes of the present Plagues and Judgments, wherewith God breaks in pieces the World; and the Causes why Gods Wrath waxes hot so against Chri∣stendom; and to excite and forewarn men to attend seriously to the terri∣ble threatnings of Wrath, and comfortable promises of Grace. (3.) To shew the way of escaping the Wrath, and preventing the last destructi∣on, and of obtaining the Grace. (1.) By general and universal Humi∣liation, Repentance, Reformation and Amendment. (2.) By universal mutual Love, Charity, and peaceableness one with another, of all Par∣ties, Sects, and Religions; That all Names of distinction be laid aside, and factious contendings about Opinions cease; and that one common Faith and Love prevail among Christians of all sorts, to preserve the U∣nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. And that all wicked unchristian-Christian Wars and Fightings, and such cruel devourings of one ano∣ther, not becoming that Name, whether for Religion, or worldly Inte∣rests, be laid aside. And (3.) by offering and communicating the same common Mercy and Benefit, that is, the Light and Blessing of the Go∣spel,
<PB N="252" REF="129"/>
and thereby Universal Peace, Truth, Righteousness, and Salvati∣on to the Nations of the Earth. <HI>For that now God would have all the World reformed,</HI> and blessed with all true Felicities, and Universal Sal∣vation, both Temporal and Eternal. In a word the Kingdom of God come, and the State of the Divine and Holy Life, tryumph, and be ex∣alted over the Animal, Sensual, Beastial, and Devilish. (4.) And lastly, That otherwise Christendom shall feel the Power of Gods An∣ger, and of his wonderful Judgments; and the Vials of his Wrath be poured out, &amp;c. For that Christians ought first to reform, and begin this Universal Restitution. Else that God will find others, but destroy them, by one another; or by letting in the Barbarous Nations, the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> &amp;c. in upon them. That the time of destroying and overturning is at hand. This and such like is their general scope.</P>
<P>And more particularly to stir up Princes, Priests, and People, all to their particular Duties. Kings, to execute the call of their high Functi∣on. To do the Will and Work of God on Earth. <HI>i. e.</HI> To reform both Church and State; and <HI>to take unto them their Scepters, and Authority, committed to them of God, out of the hands of the Antichristian usurper, &amp;c. To call a General Council,</HI> in order to a Universal Peace, and Una∣nimity in Christendom; and to agree for God and Religion; for the publick good both of Church and State; For that God will put it into their hearts to fulfil his Will, and agree, (or make one Mind and Will) and no longer give their Kingdoms to the Beast; But that the Words of God shall be fulfilled; To destroy <HI>Babylon,</HI> and all her Abominations and Idols, &amp;c. and to rule the World peacefully, under the Banner of Christ; and universally reform it out of all its horrible confusions and disorders, according to the Will, that is, the Word of God, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And all Ecclesiasticks, Angels of the Churches, Pastors, Bishops, and Priests, to perform the Ministry of their high Calling, and the Service of God, and the Church; <HI>to restore the Primitive Reformation,</HI> and do their first Works, and repent, and no longer neglect the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> of God, through the whole World, for worldly Dominion, Honours, Riches, and Interests: Nor to hinder Universal Reformation, by wrang∣ling and contesting for Opinions, Ceremonies, Revenues, Prerogatives, and Priviledges, and such like vanities; but rather to promote Catholick Charity and Indulgence, and practise Christian Humility, Self-Deny∣al, and all the excellent virtues of the best Religion in the World, which they are Chieftains of; and to Sacrifice all their dearest concerns for the Salvation of Men; And not mind their own things, but the things of Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="129"/>
And all Christians to endeavour and begin Reformation generally in their several places. For that now is the time of Gods reforming the World more then ever; That towards the end thereof, it may be as from the beginning, <HI>viz.</HI> one God, and one Worship of God, in Spirit and in Truth, without Idols and false Godds, and false Worships; That all may inhabit peaceably the Earth, without Wars, Fightings, Hatreds, Contentions, Envyings, Strifes, and without Sects and Par∣ties; lest his Wrath break forth upon them to the utmost, and there be no Remedy for the Present Generation. All which things to be sure, are no other then was the drist of all the Prophets, and extraordinary Mes∣sengers of God to Men, of old; when that all ordinary Persons, Kings, Princes, Priests, or People, were become so corrupt and exorbitant, that there were none that did his duty rightly: but all desperately transgres∣sed the Law of their God, and provoked his Wrath without measure. For what else was their Burthens, but sad Lamentations for the Peoples sins and wickedness; Exhortations to Repentance and amendment; And denunciations of Grace upon Repentance, and of Wrath upon Im∣penitence? &amp;c. And what else are these likewise, as to their main Scope and Intent?</P>
<P><LABEL>The Sum and Substance of them in General, now follows.</LABEL> The Sum of all these Prophesies in the General, is the same with all the Antient Prophets, and indeed an Explication of them; concerning the State of the Church in the last dayes; And that our present Age, is the last time of the World, wherein shall be fully and finally accomplished all Scripture Prophesies.

<HEAD>The first Relation of <HI>Kotter</HI> before the Senate, of Angelical Revelations, had by him for three years before, in the year, <HI>1616.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 29<HI>th</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> 1619. <HI>Christopher Kotter</HI> appeared before the Senate of the City <HI>Sprottavia,</HI> who were the Magistrates there∣of; and having crav'd and obtain'd liberty to speak, thus began. That he acknowledged that he stood before them, to whom he was bound, <HI>by the Holy Law of an Oath,</HI> to speak nothing but Truth. And that there∣fore in the present peculiar cause, for which he appeared, he would in good faith relate nothing else, but what in very deed and in truth hap∣ned to him, and is wont still to happen. He therefore declared, that on <HI>June</HI> 11. 1616. it hapned, that going to <HI>Gorlitz,</HI> he lodged at <HI>New∣hammer;</HI> whence the next morning being gone on his way, and past <HI>Gorlitz Wood,</HI> and entred into an open plain, intending for <HI>Langenovia,</HI> his birth-place, There approached a certain man on one side of him, of a most comely feature, in Mourning Apparel, and black Boots; whom he suspected to be some <HI>Mine-man,</HI> because the Neighbourhood abounded with Iron Mines; but he drew nearer, and lovingly saluted <HI>Christopher;</HI> inquiring, Whither he was going? And that returning his salutations, he answered to his inquiries; And that while, by this means, they came at length to familiar Speeches, and had proceeded almost four Miles in company together on their way, discoursing with one another, it fell out that entring into some narrow passages of the Road, this Companion addressing himself more roughly to <HI>Christopher</HI> then he had used, cries out, <HI>Ho! Thou man! I have something to tell thee which thou must re∣late to the Magistrates Ecclesiasticks and Saecular. Christopher</HI> amazed at these things, and not knowing what should be the matter, the other went on, <HI>That the Wrath of God is kindled against Man-kind, and it ha∣stens to inflict punishments in fury, except they repent. To punish especi∣ally that pride, impurity, and contempt of God, and of the Divine Word.</HI> When he had said these things, they were come to the Medow of <HI>Mel∣chior Frank;</HI> where, because a Ditch was to be passed, <HI>Christopher</HI> going over the little Bridg first, the other behind his back, vanished he knew not whither, and so went on alone to <HI>Langenovia;</HI> but from thence,
<PB N="263" REF="134"/>
after he had tarried a night with his Mother, to <HI>Gorlitz,</HI> to his <HI>quondam</HI> Master in his Craft. And on the 14<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> entring the Temple, heard a Sermon: and that when his thoughts disturbed so, from this late consternation, could not be quiet; for his mind sake, he went even to the Chappel, which they call <HI>Christs Sepulchre.</HI> That there, the per∣son beheld lately, again appeared unto him, and repeating the same words, disappeared. That the next day following, after Prayers in the Tem∣ple, and Sermon heard, returning into the Suburbs, the self same per∣son returned, accompanying him, and reiterating what he had before said, vanished. That after this, going to <HI>Langenovia,</HI> he remained a whole week with his Mother, lame of his feet, and molested with many disquietments of mind. But that when after he was returning back again to his business, to the City, that person met him in his Fathers Field, re∣calling those former things to his memory. That thence betaking him∣self homewards, and lodging at <HI>Sagan,</HI> as he went to Church in the morning, the same Man met him again in the street, in the same feature, yet not in mourning habit now, but of a Jacynth colour. That he therefore, after Sermon, <HI>went to the chief Pastor of the Church,</HI> M. Meisner, <HI>and related the Matter,</HI> as it had hapned, and desired advice. Who gave him this, That continuing fervent prayers to God, he would, for a little while longer, suppress this thing in silence, and as much as he could, shake those things out of his mind; mindful of that, <HI>They have</HI> Moses <HI>and the Prophets, let them hear them.</HI> Yet adding, that he would not be wanting to his duty to exhort men to Repentance; and that, that Vision, if it came from God, as Author, would return again. That <HI>Christopher</HI> therefore, obtaining this answer, went away, and going his way home, makes his Kinsman, (whom he had turn'd a little out of the way in his Journey to see) and (when at home) his Wife also, con∣scious to the whole matter. Being yet admonished on all hands, to hold his peace, lest the fame thereof being carried to the Magistrates or the Ministers, he might run some danger. And from that time, that he never made any one acquainted with it; yet perpetually disquieted in his own Conscience; till on the 14<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 1619. The same per∣son cloathed in Jacynth habit, appeared unto him again. At which sight, he was now, not only not afrighted, but filled through and through with a certain intimate and unwonted joy. But <HI>being asked</HI> (after first saluting of him) <HI>whether he had taken care of the things he had commanded him;</HI> and when, not knowing what to answer, he stood mute, That that man, with eyes lifted up to Heaven, said, <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord! but unto thy Name give Glory!</HI> And turning
<PB N="264" REF="135"/>
to <HI>Christopher,</HI> said on, <HI>But why did you neglect to perform that?</HI> Or has not thy God deserved a greater thing than this at thy hands? Who hath Created, Redeemed, Sanctified, and Regenerated thee to the hope of eternal Life? Behold! thy God hath delivered up his Son to death for thy sake! and dost thou refuse to lend him thy Tongue? and to yeeld thy self an Instrument of his Work? <HI>I declare plainly unto thee, except thou shalt do this thing, that thou shalt not have quiet in thine heart. Nor this only, but thy Name also shall be blotted out of the Book of Life.</HI> Why dost thou fear men that are lighter then the Leaves of the Trees, making a noise? Who indeed shall pass this three-fold Judg∣ment and Censure upon these things? <HI>Some shall threaten thee, others shall wonder, most shall slight.</HI> But thou, take heed thou regard none of these things! Then the Spirit began to inform him, That the face of the present times, was partly joyful, partly sorrowful. Joyful, for that they were times of Grace, in which the Light of the Divine Word hath shined in such clear brightness unto men; sorrowful, for that men would not see this Light, but keept their hearts darkned with Errors and infidelity. That these things were more at large explained by the Spi∣rit, but that all things were not retained in his memory. At length that the Spirit said, Unless men shall go about seriously, and in good earnest to amend themselves, <HI>That God was about to punish them grievously with Sword, Famine, and Pestilence.</HI> And reaching forth his right hand to <HI>Christopher,</HI> warned him further, to put off all fear. That no hurt should besal him; and lastly added thereto, <HI>I will hasten my Word to ac∣complish it.</HI> And that these things said, he disappeared. But that he was left there alone, amazed at first, then casting his eyes round about, on all parts, he saw, on one side, a white company of them that sung and tryumphed; but on the other, a black company of them that wailed and howled; and that being astonished with the Vision, he returned home.</P>

<P>December <HI>the first, Being delivered by the Magistrates to the Pastors of</HI> Sprottavia, <HI>he suffered a severe examination,</HI> That as he would be safe of his Salvation, he would plainly declare whence he had these things; or whether or no he did not feign them; or being feign'd by some one else, he did not spread them in the name of Visions. <HI>They inculcated to him,</HI> That he would consider well, how great things they were he undertook; what an horrible crime he would incur, if there were deceit under-hand; To how great danger he exposed his Conscience; how he would stir up the Wrath of God and men against him, and involve Wife, Children, and many others with himself, into great mischief. <HI>He having heard all things with a chearful mind, and nothing afraid, Answered,</HI> That he took upon him all the Curses; And wisht all those things might happen, if he ever spake any thing besides those which he saw, and heard, and received in command; That no such things ever hapned to him, so much as in a dream; much less was feigned by himself, a man ignorant of all things; Nor that any of those things were received, or heard from any man; But that all those things were so represented to him by Visions. But whether the Spirit was a good or evil one, he could not discern; and therefore asked counsel and information, whether any thing here was contrary to the ex∣press Word of God, or no? But yet that himself judged him a good Spi∣rit.</P>

And on bended knees, adored Jesus the Son of God; That seeing he was that Saviour, who hath bruised the head of the Serpent, and came into the World to destroy the works of the Devil, that through his Mercy and Merit, he would vouchsafe him this Grace, That if this Vision was any Spectre or Ghost, or any Inchantment of Satan, that he might be delivered from it. That he would grant him to know it, and would make his Conscience quiet. Having poured out this Prayer unto Christ, on a sudden he felt in his heart so great solace and joy, that he could not express in words.

He went a Journey accompanied with a Friend▪ but his Angel appearing unto him, led him out of his way into the Field, and asked him, <HI>If he had done his Errand to the King?</HI> Who said, <HI>He had: but few gave heed; That he did expose himself to laughter.</HI> The Angel comforts him, That he would not regard, though none at all believed: And as the Prophet <HI>Elisha</HI> answered the unbelieving Captain of <HI>Samaria,</HI> Thou shalt see, but shalt not injoy: So it shall be with them that will not believe. They shall see, but receive no benefit, &amp;c. And after several Visions and Discourses, the Angel also informed him what he should answer Mockers; If any one say unto thee, How darest thou ut∣ter such things too high for thee, nor ever likely to come to pass? An∣swer thou, Our Conversation is in Heaven, from whence we expect our Saviour Jesus Christ. They will say, How thou a mortal man art not afraid to speak of Heavenly Things? Say thou, I am indeed mortal, but I believe Christ will reform this mortal body, and fashion it like his glo∣rious Body. They will urge, That thy Predictions are against reason. Thou shalt answer, That God hath made all things subject to himself; nor is his hand shortned, that he cannot save; nor is any thing at length impossible to him. Then the Angel inlarged this Discourse with an ex∣cellent Passion Sermon, &amp;c.—</P>
<P>Innumerable Instances of this kind might be collected out of his Pro∣phesies,
<PB N="267" REF="136"/>
but these may suffice, onely one thing must not be omitted, to be left to the prudent Readers consideration. And it is this.</P>
<P>In one of his Prophesies, the <HI>Burning of a great City</HI> is given, as a Character of the time for fulfilling of these things. The words run thus.</P>
<P>—But what the great Lion said, he was forbidden to reveal. For it was said unto him, Let that day pass away first, wherein <HI>a certain great City shall be burnt down with the flame of Fire.</HI> For then shall be fulfilled what the Lion hath spoken. These words seal thou up: but i'th mean while, keep them to thy self.—</P>
<P>The Speech or Sermon of the great Lion was uttered twice; first in a Lions; secondly in a Humane shape, in the year 1623. And which he was commanded to seal up; 'till when he was delivered out of Prison, in the year 1628. and then he had liberty to declare it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Note. <HI>The Burning of a great City, is given as a Character and Mark</HI> <MILESTONE N="1"/> <HI>of the accomplishment of these things.</HI> Which the Northern Deluge, which presently followed, pouring it self over all <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> made us understand of the famour City of <HI>Magdeburg▪</HI> (In the Year one thousand six hundred thirty one) But because there was then a return back of things, and a greater City <MILESTONE N="2"/> afterwards more terribly laid waste, namely, <HI>Constantinople,</HI> (wherein, in the year 1660. <HI>July</HI> 24, 25, 26. above 70000 Houses were consumed; the eighth part of the City, and that the worser, scarce remaining;) It is to be considered, Whe∣ther this <HI>Character</HI> do not square to this rather. Certainly, weigh∣ing well the words of the great Lion, (in the Prophesies) and considering the course of Modern Affairs, it will appear that things are greatly changed by the approach of the Oriental Lo∣custs. For presently, in the Year following, 1661. <HI>the Turks possessed</HI> Waradin, the Key of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Poland;</HI> and thence marching onward, subdued <HI>Transylvania, Walachia,</HI> and <HI>Moldavia;</HI> now knocking at the Gates of <HI>Hungary;</HI> and what hereafter may be done, God knows. These Divine Pre∣dictions, deservedly teach us, not to sleep certainly, but to at∣tend <MILESTONE N="3"/> to the Judgments of God. <HI>Comenius Annotat.</HI> But what and if the Great <HI>London,</HI> the most considerable City in the World, for the Protestant Interest, and the most envyed by the Papistical; and whose <HI>Burning</HI> was so <HI>remarkable,</HI> and in the most <HI>Ominous Year</HI> too in all the Worlds account, 1666. and not without suspicion of <HI>their finger in the Fire;</HI> and which,
<PB N="268" REF="137"/>
by most serious Christians, is judged, <HI>a notorious Omen,</HI> to the great City <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Mother of Harlots, to be burnt with Fire, should be here meant? Certainly it deserves some consi∣deration at least, and not to be wholly slighted and passed o∣ver; not so much as taking the least notice thereof at all.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of <HI>Christina's</HI> raising from the Dead, as it were, and return to Life, writ with her own hand, and sealed up on the Monday following, (that being on the Saturday) and which she an∣nexed for a close to her Revelations.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1627. <HI>December</HI> 30. when being afflicted with an heavy disease, I wished for death; it was said unto me from the Lord, That yet was not the time, but that I should remain in this Mortality, till the Term come, which he himself had put. But when I besought that that Term also might be shewn unto me, to prepare my self so much the more vigilently for death. He answered, <HI>There shall be yet a year ad∣ded to thy life, in which I will use thee for my works.</HI> He added, <HI>But dost thou not desire to supervive, when Jehovah shall put on strength, and his glorious Majesty? And when he shall destroy his Enemies? And when the mighty shall be scattered by him; and so those things come to pass which have been foretold thee.</HI> I answered thereunto, <HI>Lord! thou knowest that thy Eternal Delights are sweeter to me, then all those things which thou revealest unto me.</HI> But he rebuked my impatience, dehorting me from weariness; so he went away from me. Now all the following year, 1628, He made no mention of my life or death, except in the last Vision. Moreover, that I was to undergoe also one disease. Then in 1629. <HI>January</HI> the 9<HI>th,</HI> It was declared unto me by an Angel, that I should be visited from the Lord in a Dream with a Disease, by name, <HI>the Apoplexy; which also came the same day in the evening.</HI> I there∣fore, because the year was now gone, the Visions had now ceased, be∣lieved that the very time was now approaching, which the Lord had spoke concerning. And that I should not now escape this Disease, I therefore prepared my self in mind and conscience, and my desire was to
<PB N="269" REF="137"/>
be dissolved, and to be with Christ. Which hope, certain antecedent signs also did strengthen. As were certain knockings, or beatings un∣der my Bed (and under the next Table) four several evenings; (many that visited me being present, and hearing) so iterated, that each day the number was less by one stroak. At length, on the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> it sounded one; and afterwards five; which having heard, I believed, as also the rest, That one only day of my life was now remaining; and an end to be to morrow evening, at five a clock. Therefore watching all that night, and praying and meditating on eternal life, and this blessed departure▪ I decreed to pass hence. But hearing by night a certain voice, as it were of a man, three times, <HI>Come, come, come!</HI> Unusual Joy being shed abroad through my Soul, I slept a little. But Saturday morning, at break of day, when more vehement pains oppressed me, I could not but interpret that Voice to have been a Divine Call. I bad farewel therefore to my beloved Friends, visiting me all that day. And▪ I was alwayes worse and worse; till evening approaching, my Sight, Hearing, Memory, Speech, and at length my Spirit failed me. <HI>And I felt my self to go forth with my Spirit, and to be carried into Heaven; where surrounded with a great shining, I saw an huge company cloathed in White. And the Lord stepping forth, took me in his imbrace;</HI> say∣ing, The Lord hath done whatsoever he would in Heaven and in Earth! For the Majesty of his Power is exalted, and there is no counsel of his Will, nor does it admit any. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, and who hath been his Counsellor? <HI>Return therefore unto the place from whence thou art come forth; and the breath of the most High shall vivify thee. Arise, walk▪ farewel to thy Disease; and behold the goodness of Jehovah in the Land of the Living, exulting in his virtue. For the dead shall not praise Jehovah, nor admire his Works, when they go down into the place of Silence; but the living, the living shall bless thee from this time, and for ever.</HI> God Jehovah dwells on high, and hath exalted his Right Hand over all Nations! And does wonderful things, as it pleases him, at all times. He is the God of the living, who also draws forth out of death, and who gives life even for ever. Therefore sadded with these things, I begged, that he would signifie unto me, <HI>How ma∣ny the dayes of my life should be▪</HI> But he said, <HI>Thy times are in the hand of the Lord. He has measured thy years, and hid thy term from thee. Live therefore, and injoy the goodness of God upon the Earth amongst his Saints. But sanctifie thy years to God thy Creator, and live righteously.</HI> But thy reward and thy portion shall not wither away, nor perish; but thou shalt find it, and shalt rejoyce concerning it, and in it, unto eternity.
<PB N="270" REF="138"/>
That also which the most High does with thee, accept gratefully, and go not contrary to thy Creator, by thy impatience. <HI>Go thy wayes now, and return, for it is Jehovah who doth good to thee, and hath a care of thee.</HI> Therefore offer unto him the sacrifice of praise, and render thy Vows to the most High; giving thanks also unto him, that he works the Work of Salvation in thee, and will still work, even until he shall blessedly fi∣nish it, unto the praise of his Grace, but unto thy Honour. <HI>I wish use thee no more unto my works, neither will I come unto thee.</HI> Now there∣fore glorifie God in thy Body and Spirit, which he hath given thee. Ac∣quiesce now in Heart and Conscience; and give honour to God who doth all these things, to the praise of his glorious Grace: My Peace be with thee! After he had said these things, <HI>I falling down, worshipped him; And together also returned into life. Sad indeed, yet restored that very moment, to full vigor, and health, and strength. To this great God, be Honour, Praise, and Empire, unto Ages of Ages, for ever.</HI> Amen.</P>

<P><HI>VEterinus</HI> not contented with what had passed in his Examination, although equally present with others, and astonished, he seem'd to give glory to God; and by giving his hand, promised silence, and with others subscribed his Testimony to the whole Business, as it was act∣ed: Yet relapsing into other thoughts, not onely wrote to <HI>Drabricius's Adjunct,</HI> that he could not yet acquiesce; but went on to molest <HI>Drabri∣cius,</HI> falling upon him more sharply than ever; pretending the causes of his unquietness: 1. That they had not satisfied him concerning so ma∣ny things yet to be fulfilled; which, that he should believe to have pro∣ceeded from the mouth of the Omuiscient, he could by no means be per∣swaded to. 2. That he saw what causes <HI>Drabricius</HI> had of forswearing himself; namely, Self-love, and Covetousness; that he might not deprive himself of the Opinion which he now saw rais'd of him, and of the Be∣nefits begun to be now offer'd to him for his Prophecies; and adding al∣so blasphemy against <HI>the Dictator of Oracles,</HI> calling him, That vain and lying Fellow, and other foul things.

it. But all in vain. For he senta violent Writing to <HI>Drabricius,</HI> impor∣tunately urging that he would answer him.

<P>I <HI>Nicholas Drabricius</HI> a <HI>Strasnian,</HI> Exile of Christ, by this my Wri∣ting confess, That certain Observations of <HI>Paul Veterine,</HI> Inhabitant of <HI>Puchow,</HI> directly tending to the abuse of the Divine Name, and the Voice through me made to the Nations of the Earth, Eastern, and We∣stern, and Northern, and Southern, have come to my hands: By which, I stirr'd up unto zeal, purposed to snatch up the <HI>Sacred Book,</HI> and <HI>on what∣soever place I should light, to take that for a foundation of my Answer:</HI> I open'd therefore, and beyond hope presently are offer'd to my Eyes those last words of <HI>David,</HI> (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 2.) <HI>The Spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me, and his Word by my Tongue:</HI> Which admiring, I opened again, and fell upon those words of <HI>Samuel,</HI> (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7. 2, &amp;c.) <HI>If ye do return un∣to the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange Gods, Baalim and Astaroth, from among you;</HI> (but in the Papacy, Idols and Images of He and She Saints) <HI>and prepare▪your hearts unto the Lord, to serve him only,</HI> &amp;c. And I will pray for you unto the Lord; and he pray'd, and the Lord heard him; and the Lord thundred with agreat Thunder upon the <HI>Phi∣listines,</HI> and discomfited them, and they were smitten before the Children of <HI>Israel:</HI> And <HI>Samuel</HI> builtan Altar unto the Lord, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When furthermore I turned over three leaves, there came in sight the 14 <HI>vers.</HI> of <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. of the same Book, <HI>If ye will fear the Lord, and serve</HI>
<PB N="276" REF="141"/>
<HI>him, and hear his voice, and not disdain the mouth of the Lord, ye shall con∣tinue:</HI> and <HI>v.</HI> 20, 21. Fear not, but serve the Lord with all your heart; follow not after vain things, Idols which will not profit you, because they are vain.</P>
<P>At length I opened anew, and found <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. of the Book of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> where it is said, That Wisdom enters not into a malitious Soul: And al∣though the Spirit of Wisdom be a kind and loving Spirit, yet it acquits not a Blasphemer of his Lips, because God is Witness of his Reins, and a true Searcher of his Heart, and Hearer of his Tongue. Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid, nor escape Judgement, for the correction of his Iniquities; and the Mouth that belieth, slayeth the Soul.</P>
<P>It slayeth indeed: I, which in my time also mine Eyes have seen how many, by the blasphemous speech of their mouth, and by the Writings of their hands, have procured destruction to themselves; being made a Spe∣ctacle to Angels and Pious Men, in whom is no guile; Such, (as by the goodness of God) there are many every where, Men great, and illumina∣ted, Divines and Statesmen, through <HI>Hungary, Holland,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> found: Who, how sincerely and reverently they receive the Words of God by me pronounced, have testified it by their Writings; after that God had given it into their hearts to see, and know, and understand the hand of God to have done this, <HI>and the Holy One of Israel to have spoken by me (Isa.</HI> 41. 20.) now in the last days of the World: A'so concerning <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> (Ezek. 39. Rev. 20.) That they are about to be rooted out, with all Errors of depraved Doctrine.</P>
<P>Wherefore I <HI>Nicholas Drabricius</HI> forewarn all who have read the fore∣mentioned VVritings of <HI>Paul Veterine,</HI> and beseech them by the Bowe's of the Mercy of God, That they take heed to themselves thereof; as be∣ing guileful, false, drawing their Rise from Satan the Father of Lyes; of which Father of Lyes, Christ saith, That he came and took the words of God out of the hearts of men, lest they should believe and be saved, <HI>(Luke</HI> 8. 12.)</P>
<P><HI>But let all know that the Lord is my God, who vouchsafeth to speak to me unworthy; and that I, and my Adjunct, who in my stead declares the Words of God in the Latin Tongue, to the Nations of the Earth; and lastly, the Promoters of the Work,</HI> added unto us from Heaven, seek no other things, (God lives, and our Soul lives in God) than the Honour and Glory of God first: The Honour, I say, of the Omniscience and Veracity of God; who, as he hath promised, the Beast being cast down, and the Babylonish VVhore burnt, and Satan bound, to renew to himself his Church on the

face of the whole Earth; <HI>So he is about to do it now in our days:</HI> That all the Kingdoms of the VVorld may become our Lords, and his Christs, <HI>(Rev.</HI> 11. 15. and Chap. 17, 18, 19, 20.)</P>
<P>Next we sought also (by the Command and Charge of the Lord our God) our Neighbours good, both of Christians especially before others, and also of the yet Infidels, Turks, and whatsoever Pagans, that they may be converted from Idols, and other Abominations, to the Living God, and his holy and pure Worship: Of which things, what the Wisdom of God, in the year 1653. <HI>Nov.</HI> 8. spake to me, may be read in these Reve∣lations. For all these are destitute of the true and saving Faith of God, given to the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and other Saints; Instead of the Law of God, the Turks having their Alcoran, the Jews their Tal∣mud; but many Christians, the Pope, and other Leaders of Errors.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We sought also with a dutiful, faithful, and simple, and sin∣cere mind, to execute the Commands of God, without all respect to men, by testifying to all, (whether it please all, or displease some; and whether they will hear or forbear, believe or not believe) That God never will'd, nor yet wills the Death of a Sinner; but that all converted from Impiety, Errors and Iniquities, do Judgement and Justice; <HI>Giving to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore the Wisdom of God</HI> Commanded me to speak unto the House of Austria, (with her Supporters, the Spaniard and Pope; Him, as a broken Reed; This, as a Fire-brand burnt; and to others) That the Lord of Heaven and Earth was about to do unto the House of Austria, as he did unto the House of Ahab; and to his Counsellors and Prophets, as Elias did unto the Baalites; whom in the sight of all the People he slew with the Sword. As it was said unto me in the year <HI>1644.</HI> April <HI>12.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore I <HI>Nicholas Drabricius,</HI> a Witness of the Veracity of God, (a Witness, I say, unto my Self, and unto others, the Godly) that the Lord does not any thing, but he reveals his Secret to his Servants the Prophets, <HI>(Amos</HI> 3. 8.) The Lion therefore roaring, who is not affraid? And the Lord commanding, who prophesies not? <HI>(v.</HI> 9.)</P>
<P>Our Predecessor <HI>John Hus,</HI> about to glorifie God and his Truth, by his Death, said to his Persecutors, An hundred years being rowled about, ye shall answer to God and to me. I his Follower say the same thing to my Persecutors; and cite you, Gods and mine Accusers, to the Tribunal of Jesus Christ, that you there answer for your Blasphemies, who in me unworthy, blaspheme God and his Spirit.</P>
<P>As if now he had not promised in the l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st days, To pour out his Spirit upon all Flesh, that your Sons and Daughters may prophesie, and your
<PB N="278" REF="142"/>
old men dream dreams, and your young men see Visions, <HI>(Joel</HI> 2. 28.) Like as is done even to me an old man, (now almost fourscore years old) by the undeserved grace of God. And before me, to <HI>Christopher Ketter,</HI> and to <HI>Christina Poniatovia,</HI> whom also I (as many other godly persons) account for a Servant and an Handmaid of the Lord; and acknowledge the like things to have been declared unto them, as unto me, (of the Plagues of God a coming upon Christendom from the East, as they now begin to come) from the same merciful God, always fore-warning the World.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Drabricius <HI>was not (that I may speak with</HI> Amos, <HI>contending with his Detractors) a Prophet or a Prophets Son,</HI> (Amos <HI>7. 14.)</HI> But the Lord commanded me to write the Word heard out of his Mouth: And I wrot for the most part by night, in the dark, on a Stone Table, or even with Chalk, lying by my Bed side, in a Chest; Performing my duty laboriously <HI>(26</HI> years) to my Lord; neither changing any thing, but just as the Lord and my God vouchsafed to speak concerning Christians and no Christians, Kings and Kingdoms, Lords and Subjects, Priests and People: <HI>Especially concern∣ing Idolatry and Images, even of our Saviour crucified, hanging stretch'd, through the Temples, Streets, and High-ways; expos'd to Winds, Rains, and the making of Nests for Birds; for a scandal and laughing-stock to Infidels, Jews, Turks, Tartars, who in the year 1663. making an Irrup∣tion into</HI> Moravia, <HI>stood amazed at this amazement of Christians.</HI></P>
<P>And because Gods will is according to the words made known unto me poor miserable man, that they be converted to that Faith given to the Saints, he will therefore certainly take away those scandals, and the Au∣thors of scandals, men gone into the way of <HI>Cain,</HI> feeding themselves fat, Clouds without Water, carried about by the Wind; Trees wither'd, un∣fruitful, twice dead; Waves of the Sea, foaming forth Confusion; and wandring Stars, to whom is reserved the Tempest of Darkness for ever, <HI>(Jud.</HI> 11, 12, 13.) complaining Murmurers, walking after their own lusts, whose mouth speaketh Pride and Arrogancy, <HI>(vers.</HI> 16.) Mockers, (18.) Sensual, not having the Spirit. (19.)</P>
<P>Of whose number is <HI>Paul Veterine,</HI> wholly burning with hatred against me, without all fear of God, and shame of men; tearing and bespatter∣ing me with malicious Writings; not seeking after the <HI>glory of God, or the saving Good of his Neighbours:</HI> but that he may bring the Speeches of God into suspicion and reproach; wholly after the Example of the worst a∣mongst the Pharisees, who said of Christ, He hath a Devil, and is mad; why do you hear him? <HI>(Joh.</HI> 10. 19.) Although the more Moderate said, These are not the words of one that hath a Devil, (v. 2.) As even now
<PB N="279" REF="142"/>
many moderate men, (even in remote Countreys) say concerning the Words of the Lord pronounced by me.</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> I, <HI>with the Apostle</HI> Paul, <HI>(2</HI> Cor. <HI>1. 23.)</HI> call God for a Record upon my Soul, <HI>(believing with my whole heart, and confessing with my mouth, that I also am a little Sheep of Christ, for whom he the good Shepherd, laid down his life,</HI> Joh. <HI>10. 11.)</HI> That I have neither spoken nor written any thing, but what the Lord and my God commanded me to write with mine hand, all the time of so many years, and to this very day, seeking to please not men, but God.</P>
<P><HI>For</HI> I can with Paul <HI>(a chosen Vessel to bear the Name of Christ before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Children of Israel,</HI> Act. <HI>9. 15▪)</HI> con∣fidently say, that I have the same Spirit of Faith; So that I dare say, I be∣lieved, and therefore have I spoken what I have spoken, and written what I have written, <HI>2 Cor. 4. 13.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>And first indeed to my beloved</HI> Adjunct▪ John Comenius, <HI>then resi∣ding in</HI> Hungary; <HI>afterwards</HI> departing, by command of the Lord, into Holland, that he would make all these things known to Christian Peoples, in the Tongue known to the Europaeans, the Latin. But for the Turkish Na∣tion, that he would take care to have the Sacred Books of both Testaments adorn'd in their Tongue; <HI>at the Cost and Charges which the Princess, the Mother of the</HI> Ragotzi<HI>'s, ought to furnish him with. But She esteem∣ing more the Dirt of the Earth, (Gold) than the Words of God; al∣though often admonished, did none of those things: and which is more, was the cause why her Sons also did nothing about those things. And therefore</HI> God took away Mother, with Father, and Sons, and the Ʋncle Ladislaus; one onely Granchild, Francis, being left; To what end, He himself onely knows.</P>
<P>But that they object, That the Crown of <HI>Hungary</HI> was promis'd to them; It is true; But the Condition often iterated, That they would purge this Land from Idolatry; deliberating and consulting upon this matter, with the Eastern and Northern: But what did it profit to be ad∣monish'd? When neither They, nor the King of Swede, would do any of those things; they drew themselves by their disobedience headlong in∣to destruction, as the World now sees.</P>
<P>Therefore I <HI>Drabricius</HI> publickly profess, That I believe with my whole heart, that Divine Promise made by <HI>Haggai,</HI> I am with you, faith the Lord, (Chap. 1. 13.) and iterated by our Lord Christ himself, Behold! I am with you always, even unto the end of the World, <HI>(Mat.</HI> 28, 27.) And again pronounced by <HI>Haggai,</HI> (Chap. 2. v. 22, 23.) I will shake the Heavens and the Earth, and I will overthrow the Thrones of King∣doms;
<PB N="280" REF="143"/>
and I will break in pieces the strength of the Nations, &amp;c. And to Christ, declaring the distress and pressure of Nations, <HI>(Luk.</HI> 21. 25.)</P>
<P>And that I expect, yea, now see with mine Eyes, how the Lord over∣throws the Chariots and the Riders, that every one may fall by the Sword of his Brother, <HI>(Hag.</HI> 2. 23.) And that, by it, the glory of God may be revealed; <HI>That all Flesh in like manner may see that the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken</HI> (Isa. 40. 5.) <HI>by us Two also, to you, O Nations!</HI> That the will of God is, That the Beast counterfeiting a Lamb, but speaking like a Dragon, together with the false Prophet, (that wrought Miracles before him, seducing those who had received the Mark of the Beast) be both apprehended, and cast alive into the Lake of Fire, burning with Brimstone, <HI>(Rev.</HI> 19. 20.)</P>
<P>But the Beast being destroyed, and the Whore (drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and the bloud of the Martyrs of Jesus) burnt with fire, (Chap. 17. 16.) That the Kings of the Earth who have committed Forni∣cation, and lived deliciously with her, bewail her, and lament for her; standing afar off, for fear of her Torments; and saying, Alas! alas! That great City Babylon, that mighty City! For in one hour is thy Judgment come! <HI>(Rev.</HI> 18. 9, 10.)</P>
<P>But at the length <HI>Babylon</HI> being overturn'd, that all Nations of the Earth run together into the Unity of the Faith, and Acknowledgement of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, <HI>(Eph.</HI> 4. 13.)</P>
<P><HI>I Drabricius dare, I dare, with the Apostle Paul, say, That I in my Writings have not sought my own things,</HI> (as appears others do, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 21.) <HI>but the things which are Jesus Christs; doing nothing through strife or vain glory, but in humility.</HI> (v. 3.) For I have learnt out of the VVord of my God, That God resists the Proud, but gives grace to the Humble, (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 5.) and puts down the Mighty from their Seats, and scatters the Proud in the Imagination of their Hearts, and exalts the Humble, <HI>(Luk▪</HI> 1. 51.)</P>
<P>And because with the Apostle, I believe with my Heart, and confess with my Mouth, That Prophecy never comes by the will of Man; but holy men of God to be inspir'd by the holy Spirit, and to speak, (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 21.) Therefore I hope also that it will be given unto me, from the Lord and my God, to overcome the malicious Enemies of God and mine, (1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2. 3.) Because the VVorld passes away, and the Lusts thereof; but he who doth the will of God, abideth for ever, (v. 17.)</P>
<P>Therefore into whose-soever Hands or Eyes (of those known or un∣known to me, in any Nation) mine, and my beloved <HI>Adjuncts</HI> Labour shall come; I beg and pray, and in the Name of God with Adjuration
<PB N="281" REF="143"/>
intreat, Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are seal'd up unto the day of Redemption, <HI>(Eph.</HI> 4. 30.) Being solicitous to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, <HI>(v.</HI> 3.) That we all may be one Body and one Spirit, as we are call'd into one hope of our Calling, <HI>(v.</HI> 4.) For there is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all, <HI>(v.</HI> 5, 6.) who believe that we are Called and Chosen, <HI>(Rom.</HI> 8. 33.) And that our names are written in the Lambs Book of Life, who was slain from the begin∣ning of the World, <HI>(Rev.</HI> 13. 8.)</P>
<P>If any have Ears to hear, let him hear! <HI>(v.</HI> 9.) Let him hear, I say, and weigh well, who is that Lord of the holy Prophets, who is wont to send his Angel, to shew unto has Servants the things which must shortly be done <HI>(Chap.</HI> 22. 6.) He himself namely, who is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End; who Is, and who Was, and who is To Come, <HI>(Chap.</HI> 1. 8.) That Omnipotent Prince of the Kings of the Earth, who hath lov'd us, and washed us from our sins in his own Bloud, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his Father, to whom be Glory and Empire, for ever and ever! Amen! <HI>(v.</HI> 5, 6.)</P>
<P>Take heed also All, I beseech you, of that Pharisaical haughtiness, to disdain others, and say, I thank God I am not as other men, or as this Publican, <HI>(Luk.</HI> 18. 11.) For God resists the Proud, but gives grace unto the Humble, <HI>(Jam.</HI> 4 6.) Detract not from one another, Brethren! For he that detracts from his Brother, detracts from the Law, <HI>(v.</HI> 11.) As that <HI>light Soul, Veterine,</HI> does to me his Brother; and which is more, the Servant of Christ, and Minister of the Gospel, and Pastor of Souls; whom the Apostle reckons worthy of Double Honour, (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.) by by word of Mouth, and Pen, lyingly spreading concerning me, what∣soever he can, unto my contempt; even also upbraiding me with the wounds that were given me, wholly innocent, (in the year 1635.) by a drunken Fellow, <HI>Martin Stuniak,</HI> furiously meeting me on the High∣way: For which things, this man having suffered Judgement, of the Equestrian Order, of the County of <HI>Trencinia,</HI> ought to have lost his Life; but that at the Intercession of the Lords, the Judges, I freely gran∣ted him his Life, and permitted him to remain quiet, with a Pecuniary Mulct.</P>
<P>Whosoever therefore thou art, that shalt read these and the like slan∣ders of this Calumniator; especially where he derides the Threatnings of God made by me unto him also, as vain; I beseech you, suffer not your selves to be carried away for the sake of a Fool (who saith in his heart, There is no God, <HI>Psa.</HI> 14. 1.) for to taunt at the slow Judgments of God.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="144"/>
Which is not mine Admonition, it is the Apostles; That we must not judge before the time, till the Lord come, who will inlighten the hidden things of Darkness, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 5.) For he saith, who testifieth these things, Behold! I come quickly! Amen! Come, Lord Jesus! <HI>(Rev.</HI> 22. 20.) Come now also, and shew the Verity of thy Speeches, pronounc'd <HI>hereto∣fore by John▪ but lately by Kotter, Christina, and Me, thy unworthy Ves∣sels.</HI> That the Church on Earth may now make Responsals in singing, to the Angels in Heaven, Babylon is fallen, is fallen!</P>
<P>Although, <HI>not according to our times, and the terms of days and years, which our foolish Reason is wont to fix unto thy Work, O God! but accord∣ing to thine own measuring; with whom one day is equivalent to a thousand years,</HI> (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 8.) For the Lord is not slack concerning his Promises, as some men do count slackness, (and among those my blasphemous Slander∣er) But is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, <HI>(v.</HI> 9.)</P>
<P>The impatience of the <HI>Bethulians</HI> did tempt, or try to prescribe unto God, Bounds of their Deliverance: But they are greatly checkt of <HI>Judith,</HI> because God receives not counsel from men, <HI>(Chap.</HI> 7. and 8.)</P>
<P>And what was there could seem more equal in the eyes of men, than that <HI>Moses,</HI> (as being faithful in all the House of God, and through so great Labours of forty years, with hardship passed through) should in∣troduce his People into that desired Land of Promise? Yet the Lord for one onely mistake denied him, although he earnestly prayed, commit∣ting this Charge unto another: And he must acquiesce: For who may say unto him, Why doest thou thus?</P>
<P>What did <HI>Jonas</HI>'s Murmurs, that God had forgiven to the <HI>Ninivites</HI> the destruction denounc'd by his preaching Prophet, avail?</P>
<P>Contend therefore, thou also, <HI>Veterine!</HI> or whosoever is like thee, with God; that he does not fulfill all things promis'd or denounc'd by Threat∣nings! But does he not fulfil? Does not so many Commotions of the Nations, and initial Desolations every where testifie? VVould to God the words of God may not be fulfilled on thee, and those like unto thee! VVo unto you who are wise in your own Eyes, and prudent in your own sights, <HI>(Isa.</HI> 5. 21.) <HI>Contend therefore not with me, but with the Lord; who hath commanded me to write these things that are written.</HI></P>
<P>But I am not better than <HI>Jeremiah</HI> the Prophet, unto whom proud men cast in his teeth, (as thou <HI>Veterine</HI> lately to me) Thou speakest a Lye; The Lord our God hath not sent thee. <HI>(Jer.</HI> 43. 2.) VVhen yet <HI>I may even as confidently as Jeremiah, say of a truth, The Lord hath sent me to speak (and write) all these words, (Jer.</HI> 26. 15.)</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="144"/>
But my God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, hath not left me without Consolations against you; so often promising me protection a∣gainst you; and a demonstration of the Verity of his words, in the ve∣ry work or deed it self: And the Destruction of Unbelievers, and those that devise evil things against me. And behold! How faithful is God! He hath preserv'd me hitherto, and preserves me in the midst of my Ene∣mies. <HI>But my Detractors, where now are they? Sapor, Effron, Felinus, and others? As every one fill'd up the measure of his virulency, so he was snatched away hence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nor let others expect any other thing; even intire Nations; according to those words of the Lord;</HI> Out of my Mouth hath proceeded this, which I have declared to thee, decreed in my Eternal Counsel, concerning those things, which I will have done in the last days of the World: When I will with punishments refrain the Blasphemies of the Nations, wherewith they injure me and my Name. The Earth shall tremble, and they that dwell therein: For the burning of my Zeal hath fallen like the Sun, upon those who will not know me, <HI>(Rev. 211.) And elsewhere,</HI> Whoever speakes unto you otherwise, than I, by my faithful and true Witnesses, let him be Ana∣thema▪ <HI>(Rev. 250.) Again,</HI> Let my Contemners expect no other thing, than Plagues for Plagues, and Contempt for Contempt: For with me there is not another Way, nor to me another Door, beside Obedience, Faith, Love, and Patience, with fear of my Judgements, <HI>(Rev. 257.) All which things, I would to God my Detractors would read! Perhaps they would return to themselves, acknowledging the Truth and Severity of God in has Threat∣nings.</HI></P>
<P>Concluding this my Speech, I <HI>Nicholas Drabricius</HI> will say with <HI>Job, O that my Petition might come from the God of my Salvation! That God would grant me the thing that I expect! That he would break me in Pieces when he begins, if falseness be in my mouth, (Job</HI> 6. 8, 9.) VVhy there∣fore have ye detracted from the Speeches of Truth, seeing there is none among you who can reprove me? <HI>(v.</HI> 25.)

<P><HI>Last of all,</HI> I the abovesaid, confess, That the Speeches which I have writ∣ten, but my Adjunct publish'd, are not the Speeches of an Angel, <HI>(otherwise always present with me, and carrying my Prayers to the Throne of God)</HI> Much less mine, a sinful man's; but are the Speeches of my very Lord Je∣sus Christ himself, (who is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End of all things) proceeded from his Holy Spirit; who is the Spirit of Wis∣dom

And my eyes saw the whole World in thy hand as a little Globe; and I heard thee explaining those Mysteries; how thy hand contains all things. And those other things, which would never have come into my mind, nor were suggest∣ed by any of Mortals; I did receive from thee alone, my God! with fear day and night; and did imprint them in my Memory; or also, through the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commanding, in Tables and Papers.

And that in sleep I beheld thee, my beloved Saviour! in thy diff∣rent Age and Habit, with Joy and Tears, acknowledging mine indignity; and with covered face throwing my self down at thy feet, and kissing them; and perceiving the Taste of Eternal Life, with Sweetnesses unutterable by me.

<P>After these things had been thus acted, <HI>Paul Laurine,</HI> a new Pastor of the Exiles, and a new Adversary of <HI>Drabricius;</HI> a young man, and of a firm strong complexion, and always otherwise lusty; was seized with an unexpected Disease, (as hath been before noted; the Physicians call'd it an Hectick; but in vain was all their Physick) and departed this Life, about the end of <HI>September. Veterine</HI> hitherto preserv'd; perhaps to be∣hold the works of God; to which, he stiffly and pertinaciously denies Faith and Credit; and to acknowledge his Error.

<P><PB N="288" REF="147"/>
We'll conclude onely with a wise and sober Remarque, out of the My∣stery of Jesuitism, concerning the Prophecies of St. <HI>Hildegard;</HI> which very well agrees, and may very well be applied to these.</P>
<P><Q>—Thus far <HI>(says he)</HI> the Prophecy it self: Of which, and the like, what to think, and what credit is to be given thereto, others have given their opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> That 'tis not impossible, Prophecies and Predictions of this kind, may amount to no more, than the Dreams of melancholy, superstitious, and distempered Persons: Such as of which, it may be said;
<Q><L>Augurium vanum, vani docuere Parentes;</L>
<L>Cui credens dignus decipiatur erit.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Our vain Fore-fathers taught's vain Auguries;</L>
<L>Let them be cheated, that believe such Lies.</L></Q>
But to deny all credit to Prophecies, is to be guilty of an incredulity, greater than that of the incredulous Thomas. Nor are we to think what God saith by the Prophet Joel, to be spoken in vain; That in the last days the old men should dream Dreams, and see Visions; and the Sons and Daughters pro∣phesie. Many Examples might be alledged of Prophecies of this kind; which the Events have confirm'd to be true; and therefore they may challenge Be∣lief, when they are in their Effects fulfilled. </Q>
<BIBL><HI>Mystery of Jesuitism, concer∣ning St.</HI> Hildegard<HI>'s Prophecies, approved of in the</HI> Councel of Trier, <HI>and also by Pope</HI> Eugenius <HI>the Third.</HI></BIBL></P>
<P><HI>Remarkable also, is that of the Angel to</HI> Kotter, <HI>concerning the time of accomplishment;</HI>—
<Q>What things are said unto thee concerning things future, are not said after an human manner: But after a manner which thou shalt never attain by human Reason and Wit: Jehovah hath these times in his power.</Q>

<HEAD>An <HI>APPENDIX</HI> of the planting of the Christian Religion in <HI>China,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE marvellous and unheard of Alterations and Troubles; The terrible and bloody Wars, and most wonderful Revolutions even of all <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> in this present Age likewise; but especially of the mighty, antient, and most flourishing Empire of <HI>China;</HI> have been no less astonishing and stupendous, then the <HI>Europaean;</HI> and those shameful and cursed ones of Unchristian, if not Pagan Chri∣stendom: But would require another and larger Table to re∣present also a general view thereof. And therefore we shall only add an Appendix, according to promise, of some things remarkable, touching the Introduction of the Christian Reli∣on into <HI>China,</HI> by the Fathers of the Society; and the Queens, the young Princes, her Son; the Mandarins and Colaos, and chief Ministers of State, &amp;c. Conversion from Idolatry to Faith in Jesus; and Worship and Confession of the Son of God, so nois'd of in the World of late years. And probably, they would have prov'd better Christians and Disciples under better Masters and Teachers, then such Apostles as have now the glory thereof.</P>
<P>About the Year 1580▪ as soon as the Jesuites had, by fair shews of Religion and Learning, found general success and acceptance in Europe, and well rooted themselves here; With great Zeal they compass Sea and Land, as far as even the <HI>East</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="148"/>
<HI>Indies,</HI> and <HI>China</HI> it self, to gain Proselytes; After the exam∣ple of the more devout Religious and Zealous Monks and Fryar before them.</P>
<P><HI>Riccius▪</HI> at first mentioned and <HI>Rogerius,</HI> were the two first Fathers, who were order'd to learn the <HI>China</HI> Charecter and Language, and sent thither. Who at last entred into the City <HI>Canto,</HI> but fain to return twice disappointed of their design, till in the end they make a new attempt, furnished with all curiosi∣ties; together with a solemn Embassy, in form, to the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canto;</HI> and so were received with all possible demon∣stration of respect; as before hath been related of <HI>Riccius,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In process of time, many were Converted and Baptized▪ among whom were some <HI>Mandarines</HI> and Calao<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="bleedthrough" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> (chief Go∣vernors and Officers of the Kingdom.) But the Priests and Priestlings stir up Persecution against them, make them odious and abominable, and Teachers of new Godds; imprison, tor∣ment, and banish them. But at length, through the favour of great persons, they obtain'd freedom and peace, and the Chri∣stian Religion the more spread.</P>
<P>But by the way, Had the same measure been meted to the Jesuites there, by Heathens, as they mete to fellow Christians here; or as we say, had they serv'd them in the same sauce, they might have had indeed a few Martyrs and Confessors per∣haps; but never Evangelists and Preachers, or Apostles of the <HI>Chinois,</HI> unless at Stake only.</P>
<P>We shall not go about here to give the History of the man∣ner of their proceeding, in conversion of those Infidels and Idolaters; but only present you with their Compendium (or Catechism) of the Divine Law in the <HI>China</HI> Tongue, as we promised at the beginning; together with the Letters of their Queen, and chief Minister of State, to the Pope, and their Answers, &amp;c.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary of Divine Law">
<PB N="3" REF="148"/>
<HEAD>A Compendium of the Divine Law.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Perhaps some one may ask what God is? 'Tis answered, God is no other thing, then the Creator of all things; as also the great Governor and Lord of all things, who made the Hea∣vens, who made the Earth, who made Spirits, who made Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Heavens, Earth, Men, and all things before were nothing, and afterwards were. Therefore before the Heavens, Earth, Men, and all things, there was some Lord necessarily be∣fore to create them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because all things cannot be made of themselves; all have that from out of which they are made, or a Maker of them; as Towers, Palaces, and Houses cannot be made of themselves, but must necessarily be the work of some Arti∣ficer.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore the Heavens, Earth, Men and Creatures, how can they be created of themselves? There is therefore an Author of these things, whom we name God. If men do name an Age <HI>Puencu,</HI> and make others like themselves, and a first Grand-father. (Parent.)</P>
<P N="5">5. Then these also were, after the Heavens and the Earth were. All had a Father and a Mother, from whom they were procreated. And of these, to make a Creator of Heaven and Earth, of Men and of Things, is a great Error.</P>
<P N="6">6. Some will say, The Heavens, Earth, Men, and Things, seeing they depend on God in their Creation; I am bold to ask, This God, of whom does he depend in his Creation?</P>
<P N="7">7. 'Tis answer'd, God is the first Root and Principle of Things; If he had dependence in his Creation, for that very thing he would not be God.</P>
<P N="8">8. For things either have a beginning and end; as Herbs, Trees, Fowls, and creeping things; or they have a beginning and no end, as Heaven, Earth, Angels, Devils, and the In∣tellective
<PB N="4" REF="149"/>
souls of Men; God only is without beginning and end, and can give a beginning and end to all things.</P>
<P N="9">9. If there was not God, there would not be other created things. As for Example, Of one Tree, the Flowers, Fruits, Boughs, Leaves, and Body, are all generated out of the Root. If there be not the Root, for that very thing the rest will not be. But</P>
<P N="10">10. Coming to the Root of the Tree, by no means is there another Root, out of which to be sprung or proceed. God, seeing he is the Root and Foundation of all things, out of what other thing can himself proceed?</P>
<P N="11">11. God, when he first created all things, in the beginning, he divided the Heavens from the Earth, created all species (or kinds) of things: Afterwards he created Male and Female; the Male was call'd <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. The Woman was call'd <HI>Eve.</HI> For these two had not Father and Mother, and are the first Parents of all People; All else (as <HI>Fo Ki,</HI> not excepting those whom they make Immor∣tal.) All have</P>
<P N="13">13. A Father and a Mother of whom they are born; and they could not avoid it, but that sooner or later they should be corrupted and die. God, seeing he is the true Lord of Hea∣ven, Earth, Men, and Things, &amp;c. together withal created all things,</P>
<P N="14">14. That they should be for mens use. Consequently it altogether behoves us Men to love and worship God. By not loving and worshipping, great sin is thereupon committed. For example, A couple of Parents produce a Son.</P>
<P N="15">15. They nourish, cloath, educate him. If the Son know not to honour Father and Mother, certainly he is called diso∣bedient, and most grievously sins. How much more,</P>
<P N="16">16. Seeing God is the chief Parent of Men, does it not be∣hove us to love and reverence him, since it is now declar'd, what God, the Lord of all things is? It is easie to explain the
<PB N="5" REF="149"/>
the things of this Age, (or World, that is of Mankind.)</P>
<P N="17">17. This same Man hath naturally two parts, Soul and Bo∣dy. His Body, although it be corrupted and die, his Soul cannot he extinguished, even to eternity. For in this Age (or time of the World) Souls have three differences.</P>
<P N="18">18. The lowest Order is call'd the <HI>Vegetative Soul;</HI> name∣ly, the Soul of Herbs and Trees; This Soul helps Herbs and Trees to live and grow. Herbs and Boughs, or Wood cut down, wither and perish.</P>
<P N="19">19. Their Soul follows, and is extinguished. The middle Order is called the <HI>Sensitive Soul;</HI> to wit, the Soul of Fowls, creeping things and Beasts.</P>
<P N="20">20. This Soul gives faculty (or Power) to Fowls, creeping things and Beasts, of living and growing; and makes withal that they hear and see through their ears and eyes▪ and tast and smell through their Pallates and Nostrils: through the rest of their Members, that they feel pain and pleasure, but yet they cannot discourse and reason; and when they die, even their Soul also is extinguished.</P>
<P N="21">21. The highest Order is call'd the <HI>Intellective Soul,</HI> to wit, the Soul of Man. This withal contains the faculty of the two Souls, the <HI>Vegetative</HI> and the <HI>Sensitive.</HI> Therefore it can give a faculty to men of living and growing, together also of feel∣ing and sense.</P>
<P N="22">22. Moreover it gives him a faculty of discerning all reason▪ to discern all things by. His body, although it die, yet his Soul is perpetually conserv'd, nor is extinguished. Therefore the Men of this Age only fear dead men, and do not fear dead Ani∣mals. That arises from the natural discourse (or reason) of man, that he can animadvert, and think after the death of men. Moreover the Soul of man not dead,</P>
<P N="23">23. Remains; and therefore can fear. But the Soul of creeping things and Beasts, is totally dissipated, not can strike terror into us, seeing we know, that the Soul of Man is not
<PB N="6" REF="150"/>
extinguished, it is not withal convenient.</P>
<P N="24">24. To believe the error of Transmigration. It is conve∣nient to know in the time of life, to do good and evil; each o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Souls of men after death go to the judgment of God▪ where they have a determinate</P>
<P N="25">25. Place of their reward. One place is above, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all felicity; namely, which is called the Court (or Palace) o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heaven: That is the place of remunerating the good. The second place is beneath, and hath▪</P>
<P N="26">26. All bitterness; namely, which is called the Prison of the Earth, the place of punishing bad men. For the Lord is most highly equal (or just.) There is nothing of good which he doth not reward; there is nothing of evil which he doth not punish. Nevertheless in the present Age</P>
<P N="27">27. There are some which do ill, and are rich, honour'd, without trouble, and joyful; There are, who do well, and are poor, contemn'd, and oppres'd with calamity. It is certain God waits till the death of that man, and</P>
<P N="28">28. After receives the Soul of the good Man, and takes it up into the Court of Heaven to inhabit perpetual felicity; and receives the Soul of the bad man, and sends it into the Prison of the Earth, to receive punishment without end. If we grant that there are not</P>
<P N="29">29. Rewards and punishments of Paradise and Hell, to re∣munerate the men of this Age (or present life) who do good or evil; How are the good not deceived then? And how much better a lot and portion do the evil injoy? And how can God be said most highly just?</P>
<P N="30">30. Some one will say, That reward of good and evil, is it not also in the present Age, (or life?) How goes the matter? It is answered; let us suppose those that receive the remunera∣tion of good and evil</P>
<P N="31">31. Altogether to wait, even till after death; On that very account men will be ignorant of the remuneration which is af∣ter
<PB N="7" REF="150"/>
death: And how will it be proved to them that the Lord is above the Heavens. Therefore frequently those who violate justice,</P>
<P N="32">32. Fall into calamities, dangers and troubles, that they may amend their past wickednesses, &amp; beware of future. Those who are obedient to Reason, receive a blessing descending upon them, to answer their good deeds past, and stir them up to fu∣ture.</P>
<P N="33">33. But if any well-doer be in want, in dishonour, full of labours, and calamities, perhaps it therefore happens, because that amidst their good works, they have something of evil. Therefore God with these things.</P>
<P N="34">34. Chastises him at present, but after death introduces him into the place of perfect felicity, to injoy perpetual felicity. If any do ill, and yet are rich, honour'd, and happy, according to the Age (or present life.)</P>
<P N="35">35. This therefore happens; Because amids their doings ill, they have some good mixt. Therefore God remunerates them with these present felicities. But after death tumbles them down headlong into the obscure Prison; that perpetually they may receive all bitternesses.</P>
<P N="36">36. The men of this Age, if they desire to avoid descend∣ing into Hell, to undergoe all torments, and to ascend into Heaven, to injoy all felicity. Three things are altogether ne∣cessary. First,</P>
<P N="37">37. It is necessary to know the Lord of Paradise, namely God. For men of this Age to inhabit in one anothers house, it is first necessary to know the Lord of the house, then they may enter and stay.</P>
<P N="38">38. How much less any one ignorant of the Lord of Hea∣ven, can he ascend and enter into the place of universal felicity. Secondly, It is necessary to know the way to Heaven, namely the Law of God.</P>
<P N="39">39. Men of this Age, ignorant of the way thither, whither
<PB N="8" REF="151"/>
they are a going; by that very means cannot come there. And any one ignorant of the way into Heaven, how can he possibly come there?</P>
<P N="40">40. Thirdly, It is altogether necessary to go on through the way which they now know. Because a man, although he knows the way which he desires to go, yet if he sit idling at home, and go not forth to make progress, by no means will he ever be able to come to his journeys end.</P>
<P N="41">41. In like manner, he who desires to ascend into Paradise, the place of all felicity, it is altogether necessary, that he do the works of the Divine Holy Law. Some one will say,</P>
<P N="42">42. God is the Lord of Heaven, Earth, Men, and Things; and his Doctrine is withall the way to Paradise. Now I have clearly heard and understood this. Now I desire to follow this Doctrine of the Holy God. How</P>
<P N="43">43. Therefore shall I be able to do it? It is answered; He who desires to follow the Holy Law, ought to have two aims. The first aim consists in this, That he worship God with a per∣fect heart, because he is of Heaven,</P>
<P N="44">44. Earth, Men, and Things, the Universal Lord, and crea∣ted all things that he might nourish us. The second consists in providing for a mans own Soul, to avoid descending</P>
<P N="45">45. Into Hell to receive all bitternesses, and obtain ascent into Heaven, to enjoy all felicities▪ He who desires to obtain this; three things are necessary, The first of them is, to keep the Commandments of God.</P>
<P N="46">46. The second is, He ought to blieve the things of God. The third is, He ought to receive Sacred Baptism, and to wash his past sins.</P>

<HEAD>The Ten Commandments.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To Honour and Worship God above all things,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Not to name the Holy Name of God, to utter a vain Oath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To observe Holy Dayes.</ITEM>

<ITEM>10. Thou shalt not covet another mans Riches &amp; Matters.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Ten Commandments, summarily taken, are reduced to two only; To love God above all things, and to love men as ones self. This is that which of old God from Heaven taught and commanded, that they should be honour'd and kept through all Ages. The obedient to them ascend into Paradise, and receive felicity. Those that walk contrary, descend into Hell, where they suffer torments. The above written Arti∣cles are only a Compendium: If any one desire to have an ab∣solute knowledge of the Divine Law, it is necessary that he studiously apply himself to the study of the Holy Books treat∣ing of the true Law of God, and go to the Temple of Chri∣stians, to hear the Masters of the Law come out of the West, Discoursing, Disputing, and Unfolding. Then they shall be able to understand without doubting: and this thing cannot be fully done in few words. This we have translated, as was requisite, <HI>verbatim,</HI> according to the property of the <HI>China</HI> Speech, rather then the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>From this Doctrine of the True and One God, rightly ex∣pounded,
<PB N="10" REF="152"/>
they proceed to expound the holy Trinity of the One God; then to the incarnation of the Son of God, the Eternal Word. After to the Sacraments by him appointed for the remedy of Sin; and so of all the other Articles of Faith, from first to last; and when they are well tinctured with these, they then innitiate them to a more perfect course of the Christian Life.</P>
<P>And this is the manner how they propound the Christian Mysteries to the Gentiles and Idolaters, beginning first with the principal Articles of the One and True God, and the re∣ward of the just and unjust, &amp;c. as in this Catechism.</P>
<P>Besides this, they published innumerable excellent Spiritual Books, and Books of Practical Divinity and Moral Philoso∣phy, to which the <HI>Chineses</HI> are much devoted, and endeavour'd to add to all, rare specimens of an innocent, spiritual, and di∣vine Life, if we may believe their own Testimony, which I confess Protestants in this end of the World have little reason to do. For the <HI>Ignatians</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> for the generality of them, are more excellent at Fire Works then any thing else here; and the works of the Devil, then to work the Works of God. But it's like they were better there; being likewise at the beginning of their Order, more Spiritual and Religious, then ever since the World hath found them, especially <HI>England.</HI> And yet we have a taste of their true Spirit, in their obstructi∣ons of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Embassy there.</P>
<P>Their first great Disciple was <HI>Paul,</HI> the great <HI>Colao,</HI> or Go∣vernor of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and propagator of Christianity among them, <HI>Riccius</HI> put forth many admirable Books in the <HI>China</HI> Language, <HI>viz.</HI> several Mathematical Books of <HI>Euclid, Cla∣vius,</HI> &amp;c. Universal Geography, and History of the World, with Globes, Maps, &amp;c. Natural Philosophy, the Art of Di∣alling, Books of Astrolabes, and Astronomick; Instruments of Musick, Musical Instruments and Organs. Moral Philoso∣phy, about Friendship, moderating the Passions, and to live
<PB N="11" REF="152"/>
according to the dictates of right Reason, and the rule of a good and happy life. For the <HI>Chinois</HI> were much given to mo∣ral Philosophy, and the study of virtue and happiness. And <HI>Ten Paradoxes,</HI> Moral and Spiritual, a Book famous through all <HI>China</HI> and in great esteem and admiration among them, and illustrated with Comments and high Encomiums, by the most excellent of all their learn'd, <HI>Leo</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> young Convert-<HI>Colao's.</HI></P>
<P>But that which wrought unexpressible compunction of heart in them for their ill past life, (as they say) not only among the common people, but the greatest and most learned of their Monarchy, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and <HI>Colao's,</HI> and Eunuchs of the Kings Pallace, was the Catechism of <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> translated by the said <HI>Riccius.</HI> The fame of which Book spread so, that they were fain to print it a new several times, whereby the Christian Light and Knowledge shone into every corner of the Land. With several other Books for the use of others that should come thither out of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The next famous was <HI>Trigautius,</HI> Procurator of the <HI>China</HI> expedition, who return'd from <HI>China</HI> 1612. and return'd thi∣ther again with all manner of Rarities and wrote several Books for the use chiefly of the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>Next Father <HI>Rho,</HI> Professor of Mathematicks in the Jesuites Colledge at <HI>Milan,</HI> who in a short time spoke and wrote their Language like any Native, and wrote several Books for the use of young Converts, and with Father <HI>Schall,</HI> mentioned in the first part, laboured in Mathematicks for the benefit of the <HI>Chinois.</HI> Who both by common and joynt study, put forth above an hundred Books; and especially in emendation of their Calender: he was founder of a Church in the Kingdom of <HI>Sciamsi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vagnonius</HI> followed, who found in the Province of <HI>Chian∣ceu</HI> only (after his return thither again from Banishment) 8000 Christians, and of those the chief Learned, and <HI>Mandarines;</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="153"/>
and afterwards died in <HI>Chianceu,</HI> Anno 1640. and wrote many Books.</P>
<P>Divers others also wrote innumerable Books for the <HI>Europe∣an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> help; so that there were Books written by them in the <HI>China</HI> Language by the Year 1636. to the number of 340. The <HI>Mandarines</HI> and <HI>Colao's</HI> also, wrote Comments on their Books, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Also when their Converts began to be too numerous for the present Fathers, they began an Institution of Chatechists from amongst them, to initiate persons into the Christian My∣steries. These Catechists were persons much and long vers'd in the Mysteries of Religion, and the Christian Law; and of a very divine Life (better then themselves 'tis like by far) and such as were inflamed with servour of the Apostolick Spirit and Zeal for the Conversion of others; and they were not ea∣sily admitted unto this Office, but after long experience first had of them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Their work was to go up and down the streets, and on all occasions by word and example, to bring the rude and igno∣rant to the knowledge of the True God. And as they have opportunity to sprinkle Infants and Children with <HI>Holy Water,</HI> to communicate Spiritual Books to those that lack'd; to re∣solve Doubts and Questions, &amp;c. And at a certain time of the day, when the Gentiles flock to their <HI>Churches</HI> out of curiosity, to wait there, and to explain the first Principles and Elements of the Christian Faith, which were wrote or engraven in fair and large Tables and Characters, (hung up and down upon the Walls, and by their splendid Altars) to any that were de∣sirous or curious; and to shew the vanity of the false Godds: And moreover to invite them home for farther instruction; And by these means they got many Proselytes daily. They are obliged also every day to give an account to the Fathers, that are Superiors in those places, what they have done that day.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="153"/>
The number of Christians in <HI>Pekin,</HI> was about fourscore thousand, about 1655.</P>
<P>And though this be short of the Apostolick way of Preach∣ing the Gospel to the Gentiles; yet they seem herein to out-do the Protestants, and in industry, labours, and zeal, and more abundant then they, to propagate the Faith.</P>
<LG>
<L>Look here, you Zealous <HI>Protestants,</HI> look with shame;</L>
<L>From hated <HI>Jesuites</HI> learn to spread Christs Name,</L>
<L>And Heathens form their Idols to reclaim.</L>
</LG>
<P>Things proving thus prosperous, they likewise had procu∣red the Royal Patent for Power and Liberty to divulge the Gospel through all the Empire, by the favour of the Grandees of the Court and Kingdom. But the irruption of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> about 1647. interrupted all. Which hapned by reason of the Civil Wars of the <HI>Chinois</HI> among themselves; which invited the <HI>Tartars</HI> to take the opportunity to break into <HI>China,</HI> through the Portal of their great Wall, once more, as they had done formerly before, in the Year 1256. which they held for above 200 years, during nine Kings reigns; but were at last beat and kept out again by the <HI>Chinois,</HI> till this last sudden and violent return.</P>
<P>But now they over-ran it like a flood, and subjected all <HI>China</HI> to their Empire; the King of <HI>China</HI> was reduced to such streights, that finding no way to escape from his own rebelling Subjects, and so great a Monarch forsaken of all, rather desi∣rous to die, then live to see worse; ended his dayes in a lamen∣table manner. First, With his own hands killing his Mother and Daughter, and at length grown desperate, hanged him∣self.</P>
<P>Amidst such great Confusions of the <HI>China</HI> Empire, the Christians grown to a great multitude, were betwixt hope and fear; and wait with sollicitous hearts, the new own'd Empe∣rors

inclination, and found him in the end more favourable then they could either wish or hope for. Especially upon the account of Father <HI>Schall,</HI> before mentioned; as a Stranger of admirable prudence and skill, in the Affairs of the <HI>China</HI> King∣dom; and to whom he might unbosom the secret counsels of his heart securely; and as one highly recommended to him for his rare skill in the computation of Time and Astronomy, and other Arts of <HI>Europe.</HI> And so made him Mandarine of the first Order, and one of his supream Counsellors. And set him about perfecting the reformation of their Calender, for the Universal benefit and advantage of the Kingdom; as before hath been declared.</P>
<P>After this was the Queen and her Son Converted and Bapti∣zed by the name of <HI>Helena</HI> and <HI>Constantine,</HI> of which, her Su∣pream Minister of her Court, <HI>Pan Achilleus,</HI> long before a Zealous Christian, more then once affectionately wrote Let∣ters thereof, both to the Pope, and to the General of the Jesu∣ites Society, to send more Labourers into <HI>China,</HI> as followeth.</P>

<OPENER><SIGNED>Of the most famous Empire of <HI>China,</HI> by the com∣mand of the Emperor; The Universal Vice-Roy of Kingdoms and Provinces, Quám tum, Quám Sy<SUP>c</SUP>, Fò Kien, Commissary of the
<PB N="15" REF="154"/>
Militia by Sea and Land, Duke of the little petty King, Quám Sy<SUP>c</SUP>; Treasurer of the Revenues, and Sollicitor; absolute and sole decider (or Judge) of Causes in the absence of the Emperor; Chief Captain of the Imperial Guard, Master of the Horse, Great Chancellor, Privy Secretary of the Emperor, and Chamberlain, <HI>Pan Achilleus,</HI> Chri∣stian, on bended knees, and head bowed down to the Ground,</SIGNED> <SALUTE>prostrates himself before the Throne of the Vicar of God JESUS, on Earth; the Uni∣versal Doctor of the Catholick Church, the true Lord, the most Holy Father.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I Achilleus</HI> weigh with my self, that being by Office, Keeper of the Privy Chambers of the Emperor, yet led by error, I also take care of the Militia. Whence I have diminished (that is de∣graded or debased) my self; and without light, and Discipline (that is, Instruction) have augmented the multitude of sins. Long since in the Northern Court or Palace, through the good Will of God, I hapned upon men of the Society of Jesus, who led me, who was rude and ignorant, in the open Path, exhorting me, erring and going astray, to follow the Faith. Wherefore, being with reve∣rence expiated in <HI>the Holy Laver,</HI> I then began to understand the documents (that is Fundamentals, or Principles) of the Holy Do∣ctrine, and its hidden Excellency, and high profundity. And then being immers'd in this study night and day, with a faithful heart, I have prosecuted it twenty years and more; nor durst I grow slack in the least. So I have procured the help of the King of Heaven, whom I know not how I shall be able to answer. I had often a mind to come unto your <HI>most Holy Throne,</HI> and with ve∣neration to satisfie my eyes with your <HI>most Holy Countenance;</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="155"/>
But the matters of the Empire were so various, and the Royal Affairs so perplexed, as they were; permitted me not to perform the desires of my intimate Bosome. Wherefore I am most highly ag∣grieved. The onely thought (and grief) now, of me a Sinner, from the bottom of my Soul, is in this, that the calamity of the Empire has not yet ceased. Therefore on purpose I went and asked a man of the Society of Jesus, Father <HI>Michael Boym,</HI> that in the next Ship that went away, he would return back to the great West, and come suppliant to you, <HI>the chief Priest, the most Holy Father,</HI> that before the Altar of the Saints, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> with the universal Church of the whole World, with eyes lifted up to Heaven, you would pray to God, that he would look down upon this Imperial House; with mercy help, and conserve the Empire and set limits of future speedy peace; and together would grant, that our most wise Emperor, who is the eighteenth Succes∣sor of this Royal House, and the twelfth Grand-child from the first founder of the Empire and Family; That himself (as Lord) with his Subjects, may adore Jesus the Lord of the Heavens. This at length will be the intire happiness of our <HI>China</HI> Empire. And indeed at present, the most intire, most wise, most clement, the ve∣nerable Empress, of Christian Name, <HI>Helena;</HI> The Queen Mo∣ther of the Emperor, of Christian name, <HI>Mary;</HI> The Queen his legitimate Wife▪ of Christian name <HI>Anna;</HI> and the Son of the Emperor, Prince and Heir, by Christian Name, <HI>Constantine,</HI> do all with humble hearts believe and worship the Holy Doctrine; together they have the words of Speech, which they send to the <HI>most Holy Throne. (viz.</HI> of the Pope) As for me rude Sinner, I humbly beseech you the <HI>most Holy Father,</HI> That for the hour of my departure out of this life, you would vouchsafe <HI>intire remission of the punishment of sins,</HI> and would send also many men of the Society, into this Empire of <HI>China,</HI> who by their Doctrine may convert universally the men of the Age, and may advertise them, with Repentance to give good heed to Worship, and adore the Holy Law; nor may by a vain and transient stay, be sent away with

the Dust of their Feet snatch'd up, (that is, quickly.) So at length I hope to attain Felicity truly never to have an end. With Veneration, I have in small measure, by these things, explained the Secrets of a simple ignorant Mind. I cast my self wholly to the Earth, expecting a mercifull beholding (of your Countenance) <HI>And no more.</HI></P>

<P>I <HI>HELENA,</HI> considering my self an humble Daughter, (that is, of low estate and degree) of this <HI>China</HI> Empire; I am ashamed to abide in the Palace of the Emperour. Hereto∣fore I onely knew the observance of the Privy-Chambers. I was ignorant of the Law of Forreign Lands. It happened that a Man of the Society of Jesus, Father <HI>Andrew Xavier,</HI> did stay in our Court, (or Pallace) promulging the holy Do∣ctrine. By relation of others, I began to know him. And behold! I believed, and with a Reverent Heart received from him the <HI>Holy Baptism.</HI> I caused that <HI>Mary</HI> the Queen Mother of the Emperour, <HI>Anne</HI> the Queen, (his) lawful Wife, and <HI>Constantine</HI> Son of the Emperour, Prince and Heir, (being withal instructed,) did also receive the <HI>Holy Water;</HI> it is now the third year since. Now although I ought with blood dropping, (that is, with drops of Blood) to dissolve the Mar∣row of my Soul; yet I attain not to answer, and satisfie, no not in the least. It continually comes into my mind, with Reverence to go unto the Throne of the <HI>Most Holy Father,</HI> that in presence I may receive the Holy Documents; onely I fear the difficult passages to so most remote a Kingdom. Therefore I am frustrate of my Desire. In the mean while, with profound bowing, even to the Ground, We beseech You the <HI>Most Holy Father,</HI> That You would be led before the Presence of the Divine Majesty, and out of Pious Affecti∣on toward Us, who are obnoxious to Sins; and at the hour of Our departure out of this World, You would vouchsafe to <HI>Indulge to Us intire remission of the punishment of Sins.</HI> With∣all, we beseech You, the <HI>Most Holy Father,</HI> that with the Ho∣ly and Universal Church, You would deprecate the Supreme Lord for Us, That He would confirm Our Empire; help and establish it (being once restored) with Peace; and withall
<PB N="19" REF="156"/>
would grant that this Eighteenth Emperour of our Imperia House, who is the Twelfth Grandchild from the first Founder of the Empire and Family, namely, That Himself, as Lord, and all his subjects together also, may acknowledge and <HI>own the true Lord Jesus.</HI> Finally, We ask You, the <HI>Most Holy Father,</HI> That You would send very many Men of the Society of JESUS, who far and near, may divulge the Holy Faith. These Things indulg'd to Us, will be Monuments of Your Pious Affections toward Us. But other Things, which are in our Desires, We are not sufficient to explain in Words. Onely a man of the Society of Jesus, Father <HI>Michael Boym,</HI> knows the Businesses of our Empire. We command him to return Legate into the Great West, to propound Our Speech before the <HI>Most Holy Father.</HI> He can particularly relate Our humble Will. We trust in the time of Peace, to send <HI>Chine∣ses Themselves Legates,</HI> who may present Our Duty at the Al∣tar of the Saints, <HI>PETER and PAUL,</HI> and offer Reverence. With Heads bowed down to Your Feet, We hope the <HI>Most Holy Father</HI> will kindly look upon these Senses of a rude Mind. This onely the Speech.</P>

<OPENER>To our most Dear Daughter in Christ, <HI>Helena Taminga,</HI> Queen of <HI>China, ALEXANDER VII. POPE:</HI> <SALUTE>To Our most Dear Daughter in Christ, Health and Apostolick Benediction.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>VVE have known from Your Majesties Letter, how great was the Goodness and Clemency whereby the God of gods brought You, wrapt up in blind Errors, and lying Superstition, out of the Power of Darkness, to the knowledge of Light and Truth. He does not forget to shew Pity, nor retains His Mercy in Wrath. For when You was a Daughter of This, yet the Omnipotent Lord looked down upon You; who would rather be called, The Father of Mer∣cy, than, The God of Vengeances and Revenges. Now who can search out His Powerfulnesses! Or find out the Way of His Counsels! Immense and vast Lands, whereof We have scarce heard any thing with Our Ears, the Old Enemy hath possessed with his Frauds and Fallacies. It was but like a Fable, this mighty Kingdom; no less for the Desarts and almost infinite distances of Places betwixt; than because the false Religion and Worship hath took up all things, possessed
<PB N="21" REF="157"/>
all, over-spread all. What access for Truth, through so ma∣ny Seas, wandrings of Journeys, almost another Heaven and Stars; when they were prohibited from all the Shoars, who desired a commutation of this precious Pearl before Gold and rich Merchandize: And lastly when they were defended by the impiety of the Mountains continuedly adjoyning to the Ocean, and by Laws and most strict Guards. The study of promoting the true Faith, broke through and overcame all these things: By which so many Dangers and Difficulties, Your Salvation hath been sought. Whereby so much the more attentively, <HI>Daughter in Christ,</HI> You are to recall into Your Mind the Memory of so Great a Benefit, and make known these things to Your Children, that they may put their Hope and Confidence in GOD, and not forget the Works of GOD, and may enquire into his Commandments. Although also to the sum of Joy which was brought Us, neither was this wanting, That Others also insisted on Your Example. And the Royal Child <HI>Constantine</HI> does no more grow into the hopes of the Kingdom, than of overturning Superstition. Him truly, as together also All, We Fatherly embrace; and most lovingly bestow upon Your Majesty the Benediction which You ask; and ardently pray God to make Your most Dis-joy∣ned Kingdom One with Us, both in Affection and Faith.</P>

<SALUTE>Beloved Son, Health and Apostolick Benediction.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Letter brought Us great Joy: For from the Rising and Setting of the Sun, from the North, and from the Sea, God hath dealt Mercy to Us: And He who heretofore on a sudden illu∣strated with the Water and Grace of Baptism, the Royal Eunuch, mighty in much Treasure and Riches; now hath called you, <HI>Belo∣ved Son,</HI> intangled with the Cares of this Kingdom, and the World; among which, never scarce is found place for the Doctrine of Christ, which is counted foolishness by the Men of this World; into the Light of his Son; that is, into an Immortal and never∣to-perish Inheritance of another and true Kingdom, The Great∣ness of which Benefit, as it hath affected Our Heart with great Joy; so you will plainly understand what is due from you therefore, if you look unto Him continually, who was made unto Us for an Ex∣ample of his own Discipline. But endeavour and co-work diligently, that this Work may be consummated, which is begun in this most ample Kingdom, That there may be your Praise also in the Gospel. For there ought to be no Vastness nor Longitude of Lands so great, as to withstand that Faith which removes Mountains, or Charity which never fails, endures, and works all things. By this we admit you into Our Bosom, whose Flame towards you and these Nations, shall not be extinguish'd▪ no not by the multitude of Waters which pass between Us, nor ever wax cold by any Difficulties. But the Bene∣diction which you ask for your Self, We most lovingly bestow upon you.</P>

Since these Transactions, the Emperour hath thought fit, within these few years, to send the Jesuites out of his Coun∣treys and Dominions; whether for their Good Deeds or Bad Deeds, God knows!
