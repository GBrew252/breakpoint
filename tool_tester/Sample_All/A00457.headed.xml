<HEAD>TO THE MOST gracious, and mightie Prin∣cesse, Elyzabeth by the grace of God, Queene of Englande, Fraunce, and Irelande; defender of the faith. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Your Maiesties most humble, and obedient subiect Lewys Euans, faythfully wisheth here on earth long reigne, all honor, much heith, and continuall prosperitie, and in heauen euerlasting ioye, and blysse eternall.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE INCLINA∣tion of Mankind (most graciouse, and my so∣uereigne good Ladye) is diuers, and straunge: some are giuen to pro∣uide for their priuate gaine and desires: some for high roome, estimation and honor: some for the safegard of their consciences: and some wholye to profite the common welth. Yea, and besides these, an infinit sort of others there are, who be diuersly caried (a thing not vnmete to be thought vp∣ony
<PB REF="3"/>
some liuing at ease, and in prodiga∣litie: some wyth payne vsing their in∣dustrie: some delighting in one thing, some in an other: euery one following, as his disposition is, the vaine marchan∣dise of this brickle worlde. Hence it is, that the moste famouse Philosopher <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> compared the lyfe of man vn∣to a marte, or fayre, as in the which some are busie, some ydle, some byers, some sellers, some lookers &amp; gazers on. But of the former sortes, as I can not ynough commende those, who are all carefull for their soules, seeking rather wyth losse of lyfe to winne heauen, then by rest here and ioy, in the ende to de∣serue sorowe, and hell: so must I praise such, which employe their continuall care, to the profite, enlargement, and conseruatiō of the common welth. For, vnto these, there is (as <HI>Cicero</HI> saith) a pre∣scribed place in heauen, wherein they shall lyue in blysse for euer: vnto the others, remayneth (saith Christ) the saluation of theire Soules, and they
<PB REF="3"/>
are those (O moste happie men!) that shall haue our sauiour to be their aduo∣cate and Patrone, he it is, that before his father will acknowledge, receiue, and rewarde them. Yet all are not (O right sacred Queene) to be accounted for re∣ligious, which talke of religion, and in whose mouthes onely and lyppes the name of the Lorde is, all are not true confessours which can and doe abyde long imprisonment, all are not godlye Martyrs which suffer death, yea though they dye vnder colour, and in pretence of defending the true fayth. For, many there are, whome the aduersarye har∣deneth, as the <HI>Arrianes,</HI> the <HI>Anabap∣tistes,</HI> wyth others, many there be that dye in blindnesse, that are seduced, and that defend in a maner meere heathines. Of these it is, that S. <HI>Augustine</HI> sayth: <HI>Quae est ista dementia, vt cum male viuitis, lo∣tronum facta faciatis, &amp; cum iure punimim, glo∣riam Martyrum requiratis? What madnesse is this, when you leade an euill lyfe, when you com∣mit theft, and robberies, and when you are iustlye</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>punished, then to require the glorye of Martyrs?</HI> It is not (most benigne Souereigne) all that saye: we be Catholiques, wee be Christians, we haue <HI>Abraham</HI> to our fa∣ther, whom the Lorde our Sauiour will embrace, and defende. For, there be some, I woulde there were not many, who vnder the name of deuocion doe vpholde superstition, and by the colour of godlinesse and pietie, do pamper vp blindenesse and Idolatrie. The proofe whereof (to the inwarde sorowe of any christiā hart) we may in these our dayes beholde, and see. For, to defende the pryde of one man, to maintayne the pompe of one prelate, (Lorde) what per∣sons, and how many be moued, and set on? how many be egged against Christ and his gospell? howe many be styrred vp against their Prince, their friendes, and their countrey? how many are bent against the lawes of God, of man, and of nature? neyther yet is this, so much to be maruayled at. For, vice and vertue may not agree, light muste varye from
<PB REF="4"/>
darknesse, good dealings will differ from deceyt, holynesse doth hate vngodly∣nesse, true pietie shall euer detest blinde Idolatrie, to be briefe, heauen is enemie vnto hell. Hence it is that all this hur∣lye burlie and tumults doe aryse, hence it is that within one Realme, within one Citie, yea, and within one house suche dissensions doe growe, suche stryfe doth breede, suche hatred doth happen. And yet, this is not, I saye, straunge, seing that our Sauiour hym∣selfe, hath before hande tolde, and she∣wed vnto vs of the same. <HI>Thinke not</HI> (sayeth Christ) <HI>that I am come to sende peace into the earth. I came not to sende peace but the sworde. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against hir mother, and the daughter in lawe against hir mo∣ther in lawe: and a mans foes shalbe they of hys owne housholde.</HI> What playner wordes can be then these? shewe they not, as in a glasse, our tyme? and further, fully to expresse our calling, <HI>You shall</HI> (sayth he) <HI>be hated of all men for my sake.</HI> But how the
<PB REF="5"/>
professours of the Gospell are hated▪ what whispering there is against them, what toyes are wrought, what trauaile some take, what tryfling newes be deui∣sed, what gadding, what dreaming, what inuenting, what hoping, what ymagi∣ning there is, as I am loth to vtter, (for let God confounde all foolishe deuises) so am I right sorowfull to thinke. I my selfe haue once drunke (before your Maiesties great clemencie I confesse) of the puddell of ignorancy, of the mudde of Idolatrie, of the ponde of superstiti∣on, of the lake of self will, blindenesse, disobedience, and obstinacie. This did I, this doe all they, which fondlye flee this your realme, which grudge (&amp; yet know not why) at your highnesse lawes, which (alas) resist the truth, and haue (as the Apostle sayth) a feruent minde to God warde, but not according vnto knowledge. O here how may your sub∣iects be glad? How may your highnesse reioyce, when vnto transgressours there is such clemencie founde in your grace,
<PB REF="5"/>
as inuiteth them thus boldly to renoūce their folly, and as offereth, as vnto the prodigall childe, moste gladly, fauour, forgiuenesse, and pardon? these things (most gracious Ladie) considered, let o∣thers esteeme their vaine credite as they list: for mine owne part I protest before God, and your highnesse, during life to the best of my power, to preferre the deuine Scriptures, before the <HI>Chaos</HI> of mans doctrine, to embrace your most godly proceedings, and to performe in all things towardes God, your Maiestie and my countrie, the part and dutie of a true subiect. In token, &amp; pledge wher∣of, I haue aduentured in moste humble wise, to dedicate these fewe leafes vnto your highnesse most imperiall pro∣tection, beseeching of God, to saue, keepe, and defend your Maiestie.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen Jweygh, that frendship is nothing else, (louing frien∣des) but an es∣peciall agremēt with good wil, and loue, betwene mankinde, as well in matters diuine, as humane: I do then somewhat doubt, whether I were best to publish this smal booke, or not.
<PB REF="7"/>
The thing that seemeth to let me, is the familiaritie, friend∣ship, and amitie, which hath bene and now yet is betweene vs. For I cannot but feare (so loth am I to lose olde friends) least by this mine alteration in iudgement, you also (though you haue no such cause) will alter your loue, and so with∣draw your good willes. In dede you your selues doe well know, that I was neuer chargeable vnto you, that I neuer sought
<PB REF="7"/>
friendship for gaine, and that at no time I fawned vpon any for prayse, estimation, or pro∣fite. Onelye did I accept the faithfull harts of my friends, and I greatlye esteemed the gentle willing mindes, and af∣fability of mine acquaintance. And this is it that maketh me the more sorowful, whē I feare to lose their good willes, whose friendship I delighted in, but of whose wealth and goodes I neyther had, nor desired. On
<PB REF="8"/>
the other side, my duetie to∣wardes God, mine obedience due vnto the Queenes high∣nesse, and the vnfeyned good will that I beare towardes my countrie, these do in dede now cōpell me to professe the truth that I see, to renounce obsti∣nacie, to knowledge the right way, and to bid defiance vnto Idolatrie. I haue therefore in this treatise, though not elo∣quently, yet faithfully brought forth, reason, authoritie and
<PB REF="8"/>
Scripture, and that to defende the Catholike fayth, and to chase away the smoke of hell, the mist of Antichrist, and the false long mayntayned mer∣chandise of Satan. I treade herein, I trust, the path of our perfite forefathers, I defende the Church, I giue a foyle to pride, I commende prayers, pe∣nance, and fasting, I cut down peruerse hypocrisie, deceite, and blind iugling. I extoll ho∣norable mariage and chastity, I

the cause, that I labour indif∣ferently: you shal plainly per∣ceiue that I speake nothing a∣gainst holinesse, but that I en∣deuour to doe what I can, to further deuotion and godly∣nesse. Why then shoulde our friendship cease? why should it not (these thinges consi∣dered) increase? yet some I know there are, whose breasts be stopped with such pelting disdaine and ignorancie, that hauing a sounde of the Catho∣like
<PB REF="9"/>
fayth in their mouthes, they neyther know what faith nor fidelitie meaneth. Some o∣thers there are, who thoughe they be worldly wise and lear∣ned, yet they so leane vnto self will and estimation, that they leane not in a maner, but alto∣gither besides their profession. These be not father <HI>Adams</HI> children, they are made, as they thinke, of a finer moulde, they carie such a toye in their heads (and yet know not they

Alas, is it not knowen what they are? bee they not <HI>terrigeni fratres?</HI> bee they not of an earthlye moulde? is not the trade ouer earthly that they leade? yea, and to vtter them further: touching man∣ners, be they not intollerable? and concerning religion, are not their errors in a manner palpable? they will haue no man to be like vnto them, they
<PB REF="11"/>
thinke that in comparison of them, there is none worthie to be looked vpon, none meete to be hearkened vnto: they ad∣iudge their owne persons, their owne dreames and fantasies to excel, surmount, &amp; to passe all. Who can away with such Pryde? who can suffer suche selfe will, such disdayne, suche arrogancie? But to omitte these: I shall craue of you (deare friendes) if for no∣thing else, yet for olde famili∣aritie,
<PB REF="12"/>
that you will reade ouer these fewe leaues, before you doe infringe our amitie, and that you will reade as friends, and then iudge indifferently. And for my part this promise I make, though we disagree in Religion, and that but for a time, vntill you receyue the grace that God offereth you, the light which shineth before you, and the Gospell which is preached vnto you, yet in friendship <HI>Orestes</HI> shall find

<HEAD>¶ A plaine demonstration of the erring estate of the Romaine Church.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>EWYS DVKE</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aeneas Sylae. lib. 3. &amp;c.</NOTE> of Bauiere (Christi∣an Reader) is for his constancie, and that not w<SUP>t</SUP>out good cause, had euer sithence in memorie. For being prisoner, and requi∣red to graunt some great matter, he vtterlye denying it: <HI>Albert</HI> then Marques of Bran∣denburgh, in whose handes he at that time was, threatned to deliuer him ouer into the handes of a Prince which was very cruell, and the Dukes most enimie. But the vali∣ant courage of so noble a man coulde there∣with be nothing moued, in so much that he thus aunswered: aske (sayth he) that thing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> at my hands now being thy prisoner, which thou shouldest demaunde of me if I were at libertie: else though my bodye bée in thral∣dome, yet shall my minde haue still his frée∣dome, it shall serue and obey me, and not
<PB REF="14"/>
thée. This is a great and a right worthy ex∣ample of much constancie, it was the saying of a valiant hart, and the courage of a mind vnconquered. Hereby we be admonished, that we consent vnto no vnlawfull thing, through feare, for liuing, for libertie, or for life: but remembring the office of our bo∣dies, what they are, and wherevnto they serue: that we kéepe our mindes free from all vnhonest subiection, that we doe things lawfull with consent of conscience and vo∣luntarily, that we resist wrong, and falshood with fortitude and constancie, and that wée yéelde vnto the truth, not through force or friendship, but willinglye. And what can<NOTE PLACE="marg">An ob∣iection.</NOTE> (will some say) this example make for your purpose, séeing that you nowe write, other∣wise than you haue written? how maye it defende you, which now say otherwise than youhaue sayde? or how shall it excuse you, who nowe thinke otherwise than you haue thought? what constancie (will such say) is this? howe can your alteration so soone in mynde, in iudgement, be aunswered? you haue either (say they) adiudged amisse here∣tofore, or else you now doe: so that whether it be the one or the other, offended you haue,
<PB N="2" REF="14" MS="y"/>
you are to be blamed. Alas, what arrogan∣tie<NOTE PLACE="marg">The an∣swere.</NOTE> were it, yea, what lewdenesse, eyther to affirme that we haue at no time trespassed, or not to acknowledge that wee haue offen∣ded, when the offence was euident, euident, I say, vnto others, although not (such is the blindenesse of sinners) vnto vs? Is there a∣ny eyther of such impudencie, or else of such puritie, that he will or maye in such sort ob∣iect? For be it by writing, by some other déede, by wordes or thought, who is voyde<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. lib. 20. de ciui∣tate dei.</NOTE> of offence? what mankinde, what humaine nature (our Sauiour Christ only excepted) is borne frée from the bondage of sinne? If we saye that we haue no sinne, and that we<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Iohn. 1.</NOTE> haue not done euill, the truth is not in vs, and we deceiue our selues. Whereas, if we confesse our sinnes, the Lorde is iust, he is faithful to forgiue them, he is ready to clense vs frō all iniquitie. What then? shal shame let vs from knowledging our faultes? shal foolish estimation hinder vs from confessing our sinnes? shal our friends, shal the world, shall the deuill perswade vs from detecting our trespasses? GOD forbid. There is a shame, and there is a disorder, which brin∣geth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesi. 4.</NOTE> sinne: that is (as <HI>Augustine</HI> sayeth)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE>
<PB REF="15" MS="y"/>
when one is ashamed to renounce his wic∣ked opinion, eyther least he shoulde so séeme vnconstant, or else appeare, and that by his owne confession, of a long time to haue er∣red. There is also a shame that bringeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesi. 4.</NOTE> grace &amp; aduauncement, as when one know∣ledgeth with repentaunce his misdéedes, when he lamenteth and confesseth that hée hath erred. For thereby winneth he Gods fauour againe, thereby he entreth into esti∣mation with all good men and godly. Whe∣ther is it then a greater rebuke, a more<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 12.</NOTE> shame, to confesse our selues guiltie with all men of sinne, or else to continue with the wicked, with the reprobate therein? <HI>Cuius∣uis</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cicero.</NOTE> <HI>est hominis errare, nullius nisi insipientis, per∣seuerare in errore, <HI>it is the propertie of all men (sayth Cicero) to erre: but it is the propertie onely of a foole, to perseuere in his error.</HI></HI> Had not the prodigall child re∣turned vnto his father, acknowledging and confessing his fault, full miserably in hun∣ger and filthinesse, had he ended his life. O how oft, and how earnestly doe the Scrip∣tures erhort and perswade vs to repētance! <HI>Let vs looke well vpon our owne wayes</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieremie. 3.</NOTE> (saith <HI>Ieremie) and remember our selues,</HI>

<HI>and turne againe vnto the Lord.</HI> And as for the losse of our estimation and friendes, (which is the greatest block that men stum∣ble at) if we lose them for Christ his sake, and his Gospell, we are promised the receite<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marc. 10.</NOTE> of an hundreth folde, we shall doubtlesse re∣ceiue life euerlasting. Concerning constan∣cy, is a man defending errors though stout∣ly, maintaining vntruthes though earnest∣ly, or suffering tormentes in the defence of falshode, though (as they tearme it) paci∣entlye, to be accounted for one constant, or yet pacient? Constancie is (sayth <HI>Aristotle</HI>)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eth. lib. 7.</NOTE> in things which be good and laudable. Let none therefore adiudge them to be constant, which eyther doe lie in prison to maintayne blyndenesse, or doe suffer death to defende wickednesse. Else maye you tearme the <HI>Ar∣rians,</HI> the <HI>Eutychians,</HI> the <HI>Marcionistes, Ebionites,</HI> and such like, to be men as con∣stant, pacient and vertuous as anye other. For these of their owne imprisonments doe séeme to reioyce, of their punishments they are thought to be glad, of their death they do triumph, &amp; for the truth it is (say they) that they suffer. What shall we therefore say of them, and not of them only, but of the like?
<PB REF="16" MS="y"/>
forsooth, <HI>Miranda est eorum duritia, neganda pa∣tientia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de pa∣tientia.</NOTE> <HI>Their hardnesse</HI> (sayth <HI>Augustine) is to be maruailed at, but that they are pacient is to be denied,</HI> that they are con∣stant is not to be graūted.

occasion serued me) into Englande againe of that minde to depart hence as soone, and as secretly as I coulde. In the meane tyme I was aprehended, and so committed to pri∣son. Being then there, and looking for some extreme kinde of dealing, which yet I so lit∣tle feared, as were the punishment neuer so harde, were it neuer so great, I was conten∣ted, yea, verye willing felt I my selfe to a∣bide it. But in steade of extremity, (it is best to confesse the troth) I founde much clemen∣cie, I founde in those, whome before I lytle regarded, great wisedome, good learning, much grauitie.

<PB REF="29"/>
the estate of Christ his Church shoulde de∣caye. This is the Popes owne reason, let him sée vnto it. Aske of them what <HI>Anasta∣sius, Sisinnius,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> the twelfth of that name were. They were Popes of Rome, the one was an heretike, the seconde was a wicked man, and the thirde was a monster and a very Epicure. <HI>Liberius</HI> likewise was an horible heretike, an <HI>Arrian,</HI> &amp; yet B. of <HI>Rome.</HI> I report of them as I finde it in the bookes written by the Popes owne friends.

feare, or through ouermuch simplicitie blin∣ded and seduced, who so drewe forth and vp∣helde the pompous chariot of iniquitie. And that I sée me not to vtter vntruth, that the thing may appeare, they were <HI>Stephanus, Iulius, Pelagius, Symmachus,</HI> with such like, all being bishops of the Sée of <HI>Rome.</HI> The case in controuersie is their owne, they maye not bee their owne iudges, in that their owne lawe is against them. For I am sure (indifferent Reader) that in a contro∣uersie betweene thée &amp; an other, thou woul∣dest not willingly be tried by the defendant thine aduersarie. And could the Pope except he were his owne iudge, maintaine his pri∣macie? No. And therefore being better adui∣sed, they make this law, that the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> may iudge all, but he may be adiud∣ged of none. And who made it? <HI>Innocētius, Antherius, Gelasius.</HI> And what were they? Bishops of <HI>Rome.</HI> If therefore they proui∣ded for their owne preferment, coulde you blame them?

<HI>none maye iudge them.</HI> I vse (Christen reader) no deceit, they be their owne words, wey thē with indifferencie, I aske no more, it shall doe thée good so to doe.

Wel consider we more of their lawes, and let vs consider them indifferentlye.

Onely thus much I say, if pride, if couetousnesse, if desire alone, and onelye to raigne, hath bene the grounde, and was the verie cause, why such lewd lawes were made, if Sathan was the subtile secretary therin, why trouble we our selues? why torment we our consciences? why care we ought for them? we see his au∣thoritie, let his pardons alone, haue not to doe with his dispensations. <HI>Papa quando{que} ni∣mium papaliter dispensat: <HI>The Pope</HI></HI> (thus<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barthol.

be contented to heare. I will be briefe, I wil not be partiall. To begin I néede not with the primitiue estate of Christ his Churche, wherein we can finde no such primacie, no superiority amongst the Apostles, who then all hauing receyued the holye ghost alike did preache the Gospell, and so faithfully did set forth the truth, without pride, without cha∣lence of the highest roome, or once mention of any supreme heade to be had or exercised among them. Let the Popes owne autho∣rities preuayle, let his euidences be seene, are not the wordes thereof these? Although <HI>Peter, Iames,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> were preferred by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clomens.</NOTE> our Sauiour in a maner aboue the rest, yet claymed not they any glorie, or title of pri∣macie: and shal then the Pope claime that, which <HI>Peter</HI> neyther would nor could not? In the time first of <HI>Cyprian</HI> we reade, that certaine lewde Priests being worthily con∣demned by the Bishops of <HI>Aphrica,</HI> ranne to <HI>Rome,</HI> that by the Bishop there, they might haue the matter farther discussed. <HI>Ci∣prian</HI> findeth great fault with the hearing of them, and writeth thereof vnto <HI>Lucius</HI> then bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> saying that vnto eue∣ry bishop a portion of Christes flock is com∣mitted,
<PB REF="32"/>
who shall render accordingly an ac∣count for the same, and that therefore these men ought to be tried, as in dede they were in <HI>Aphrica,</HI> and that by and vnder their owne bishops: he writeth likewise at large concerning the same, and much reprehen∣ding it vnto <HI>Cornelius.</HI> Now what autho∣ritie, or what grounde of supremacie, a fewe disobedient and conuict Priestes coulde pur∣chase vnto the Sée of <HI>Rome,</HI> iudging vp∣rightly, I sée not. But if they be either s ig∣norant, or s arrogant, as to frame vppon these runnagates, their right, and vsurped title, let them then, and wyth good indiffe∣rencie consider, how <HI>Dioscorus</HI> their Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> being excommunicated, and yet touching no matter of faith, did appeale (for so they thēselues name him) vnto the <HI>Pope,</HI> the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Here we finde another Pope, and vnto whome their Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> hath appealed. Tou∣ching the time of <HI>Constantine,</HI> it was he, &amp; not <HI>Siluester,</HI> it was the Emperour, and not the bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> that made lawes in defence of the Christians, it was the Em∣peror that condemned the writings of <HI>Ar∣rius,</HI> it was he that called from banishment
<PB N="20" REF="32"/>
<HI>Porphyrius,</HI> and it was onely he that then made an edict against heretikes. But if they will haue it that <HI>Constantine</HI> did ordeine y<SUP>e</SUP> bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> to be the chiefe, then let them goe forward in their historie, wherein they shall finde, how at that time this voyce was hearde, <HI>hodie venenum ecclesiae est immis∣sum, <HI>nowe doth poyson enter into the Church.</HI></HI> And that this voyce was true, you shall well proue, if you examine throughlye the whole doings of <HI>Siluesters</HI> successours. For (O Lord) what crueltie was amongst them! what ambition! what symonie! what disobedience! what heresie was amongst them! Come wée then vnto the Emperour <HI>Iustinianus</HI> his time. For concerning <HI>Mar∣cellus</HI> and <HI>Anacletus,</HI> if the decrées in their names set forth, be theirs, (as in déede they seme not to be) they were bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> and therefore is their authoritie contrarie vnto the scripture, in aduauncing themsel∣ues, nothing worthie of anye reasonable man, or of anye indifferent Christian to bée estéemen. And before we speake of <HI>Iustinia∣nus,</HI> you must vnderstande that there were in his time, and vnder him, among others, fiue especiall Cities, that is <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI>
<PB REF="33"/>
<HI>Constātinople in Thrace, Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Aegipt, Antioch in Siria, &amp; Hierusalem</HI> in <HI>Iudaea▪</HI> Of these fiue, there were fiue chiefe fathers or Patriarches, euery one hauing a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and a seuerall authoritie in causes spi∣ritual, such I meane, as Archbishops should haue, euery one within his owne and pro∣per Prouince.

And that this is most true, the wordes of <HI>Iusti∣nian</HI> himselfe shall testifie, who hauing next vnder Christ, a kinde of supreme au∣thoritie, made certaine Ecclesiasticall lawes to gouerne and rule them all. So that some lawes being made concerning the Clergie, for the due execution of the same, he sendeth his especiall commaundement vnto the sayd fiue Patriarches in these wordes: <HI>Iubemus igitur beatissimos Archiepiscopos, &amp; patriarchas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperator, Petro glo∣rios prep.</NOTE> <HI>hoc est, senioris Romae, &amp; Constantinopoleos, &amp; A∣lexandrinae, &amp; Theopoleos, &amp; Hierosolymorū. &amp;c. <HI>we wil therfore that the most holy arch∣bishops and Patriarches, that is to say of</HI></HI>

none other made lawes, and the same aswel spirituall as temporall.

<PB N="22" REF="34"/>
Emperor, so al we would do vnto our most gracious souereigne and most royall Prin∣cesse the Queenes Maiestie, and so vnto hir successors. You see that there is no cause but we shoulde doe it, there is no reason, no au∣thoritie to the contrarie. Let any indifferent man reade the Chronicles, yea let him reade their owne writings, and it shal be euident, that the Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI> had not the title of any such Primacie, vntill at length tho∣row pride and ambicion, contrarie vnto all custome and good order, they vsurped that authoritie. <HI>Symmachus</HI> and <HI>Laurentius,</HI> being both at one time chosen Bishops of <HI>Rome <HI>(tantaest discordia fratrum)</HI></HI> after much strife and controuersie, were faine to go vn∣to <HI>Rauenna,</HI> there to abide the iudgement, (as in déede they did) of <HI>Theodoricus</HI> the king. <HI>Pelagius</HI> the second, how was he cho∣sen? <HI>abs{que} decreto Principis, contra consuctudinem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nauclerus.</NOTE> <HI>without the decree of the Prince agaynst all custome.</HI> Here they see that it was con∣trarie vnto all former example, that the by∣shop of <HI>Rome</HI> shoulde be chosen against the decrée and will of the Prince. <HI>Bonifacius</HI> the third did will, that the election of the B. of <HI>Rome</HI> shoulde consist and be determined
<PB REF="35"/>
by the iudgement of the Prince, of the Cler∣gie, and of the Laitie, &amp; that for good causes. But <HI>Phocas</HI> (they saye, marke well when<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno do∣mini. 604.</NOTE> their kingdom began) cōmaunded at the re∣quest of the B. of <HI>Rome,</HI> that all Churches should be obedient vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Romain church. And yet was the authoritie of y<SUP>e</SUP> bishop not∣withstanding so smal, y<SUP>t</SUP> he should be suffred to do nothing without y<SUP>e</SUP> commaūdement of y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperor. For <HI>Bonifaci{us}</HI> the fourth was glad to aske leaue of <HI>Phocas</HI> that he might transpose the temple <HI>Pantheon,</HI> to be the Church of our Ladie, and of all Sainctes. <HI>Bonifacius</HI> the fift, coulde not without the licence of <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperour, not so much as be suffered to take the tiles from <HI>Romulus</HI> temple, to couer S. <HI>Peter</HI> his Church. Neither was this in the time when the Church was persecuted, it was six hun∣dreth and twentie yeres after Christ, it was when all Christendome (as they say) obeyed the Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI> But what obedience was giuen him, by his obedience vnto the Emperour, it maye appeare. For if it were not lawful for him without y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperours leaue, to medle with the tiles or temporall goods of one Church, then it was lesse law∣full
<PB N="25" REF="35"/>
for him to haue to doe, as he now clay∣meth with y<SUP>e</SUP> whole temporalities of all the Churches in Christendom. If he might not doe so litle a thing without the consent of the Emperour, much lesse might hée doe greater thinges, much lesse lawfull it was for him to depose Christian Princes, and to tread vnder his féete Kings and Emperors. Let here indifferencie take place, if wée be wise, we wil wey these things without par∣tialitie. Neyther may I here omit <HI>Paschalis</HI> which was chosen to the Bishopricke of <HI>Rome</HI> in the yeare of our Lorde. 817. Who for that he was not elected by the authoritie of the Emperour, was faine to sende vnto <HI>Lewys</HI> named for his clemencie <HI>Pius,</HI> then being Emperour, to declare in whome the fault was, and that it was long of the peo∣ple and the Clergie that he was so elected, adding further that he was chosen against his will. With this satisfaction <HI>Lewys</HI> was pleased, and therevppon he wrote vnto the people and Clergie that they shoulde kéepe the institutions and decrées of their aunces∣tours, and that they shoulde not offende the imperiall Maiestie againe. This is so ma∣nifest that what should we néede any more?
<PB REF="36"/>
and yet séeing I am entred into the historye, I will alledge what <HI>Gregorie</HI> the fourth did, in acknowledging his duetie vnto the Emperor. He being chose bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the consent of the people and the Clergy, would in no wise take vpon him that digni∣nitie, vntill the sayd <HI>Lewys</HI> had confirmed his election. Hath then the Emperour no∣thing to doe with the chosing of the Bishop of <HI>Rome?</HI> who is so fonde as to defend such absurditie? is not this playne? is not this true? is not this in their owne historie? was not <HI>Benedictus</HI> the thirde, confirmed Bishop by <HI>Lewys</HI> the second? was not <HI>Ni∣cholas</HI> the first, confirmed by the same Em∣peror? &amp; that it should be so, was it not the order alwayes, the lawe, and the custome? Concerning their Counsels, in speaking of one, we shall easily bewray the weakenesse of the others, and that if specially we touche any of their chiefe. Their Councell holden at <HI>Chalcedon</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> they do in althings so reuerence, receiue, and so beleue, as they doe the foure holye Gospels of our Sauiour Christ. If then we can prooue errors there∣in, of necessity must they acknowledge their Counsell to be erronious, and themselues

to bée blasphemous. Let them nowe take héede, for if this go forwarde, their craking of Counsels, their authoritie of fathers, shal henceforth not helpe them a farthing. But how shall we proue it? Euen by the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> himself, I think his friends will be glad of such a iudge. If he procede against them, let them blame none but him, whose blames they seeke to defende. To be briefe, thus shall we proue it:</P>
<P>All such as haue offered vnto anye man a prophane name, a name of rashenesse, of pride, and of blasphemie, were erronious and wicked.</P>
<P>But the Counsell holden at <HI>Chalcedon</HI> hath offered vnto the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> a prophane name, a name of rashnesse, of pride, and of blasphemie.</P>
<P>Therefore the Counsell holden at <HI>Chal∣cedon</HI> was erronious and wicked.</P>
<P>Here the Proposition at <HI>large</HI> is vndoub∣tedly true, the <HI>lesse</HI> is prooued out of <HI>Grego∣rie</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> in his Epistles vnto <HI>Eulogius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> vnto <HI>Iohn</HI> Bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> &amp; vnto <HI>Anastasius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Antioch.</HI> The <HI>Con∣clusion</HI> can in no wise be denied.

then in what estate, in what strength is their Euangelicall Counsell, vnderstande how soone they are disproued, and how easie it is to detect their pryde, their vsurpation, their blasphemies, &amp; ambicion. I sée a great deale more, which I might haue saide, tou∣ching reason and authoritie, but to any rea∣sonable man, to any not drowned in the ve∣rie pit of darkenesse, thys much may suffice. Wherefore, forget not that <HI>Gregorie</HI> cal∣leth this name of a supreme head, of a gene∣ralitie, of an vniuersall Patriarch, of a su∣preme Bishop (for all is one) the name of pride, of rashnesse, of blasphemie, an vngod∣ly, a wicked and a prophane name, and that he further sayth: <HI>None of my predecessors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg.

Well, shal we haue a vew of the scriptures? shal we see what in them y<SUP>e</SUP> bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> hath, to mayntayne his papacie?

time, before he suffred, which of them should<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marc. 10. Math. 20.</NOTE> be the greater. But our Sauiour did muche reprehende them therefore as we reade at large thereof in the Scriptures, where hée sayth that amongst the Princes of the Gen∣tiles such worldly power, such dominion is vsed: <HI>Non ita erit inter vos, <HI>it shall not be so amongst you.</HI></HI> And yet notwithstanding all this, the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> will néedes haue <HI>Peter</HI> (God knoweth little for <HI>Peters</HI> sake) to haue the preheminencie, the maio∣ritie, the superioritie ouer all the rest. Christ alloweth it not, the Pope will, belike it shall be as he will. That I speake no worse of him, a wilfull part he playeth thus in a∣busing holye Scripture, in peruerting the sense, by his insensible reasons, to serue his turne and desire.

arguments, consider their absurdities, and wey them with indifferencie. Their first fonde argument is this: Christ sayd, thou<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 16. Behold how this place is abused.</NOTE> art <HI>Peter,</HI> and vpon this rocke I will builde my Church. Therefore the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> is the supreme heade. O Lorde what a wise reason is this / where was Logique, and that I speake not of the rest, where was cō∣mon sense when this was framed? vppon what will he builde his Church? shake off blindenesse, confesse the truth, <HI>super hanc pe∣tram,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrose.</NOTE> <HI>id est, super hanc fidem, <HI>vpon this rock, that is to say, vpon this fayth.</HI></HI> Vpon him which rightly confesseth that Christ is the sonne of the liuing God, shall the Church be builded. And did none euer confesse that but <HI>Peter?</HI> yes, all the rest of the Apostles, <HI>Iu∣das I scariotes</HI> excepted. Therefore vppon them all, vpon any, whosoeuer that confes∣seth Christ to be the sonne of y<SUP>e</SUP> liuing God, is the Church builded. For what is the buil∣ding of Christ his Church? is it any thing else, than the increase of faithfull people, confessing and acknowledging the faith of Christ? what dreame they than, vpon <HI>Tues Petrus, &amp; super hanc petram?</HI> perceiue they not how that place of scripture is most playne?
<PB REF="39"/>
or is it vnto them that the holy ghost, by the Prophete <HI>Esay</HI> doth thus speake? <HI>you shal</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 6.</NOTE> <HI>heare, but you shall not vnderstand, you shall see, and yet not perceyue.</HI> Oh, <HI>re∣pent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marc. 1.</NOTE> <HI>and beleue the Gospell.</HI> For this ar∣gument they themselues sée, doth neyther proue in <HI>Peter</HI> any superioritie, nor yet that their Pope ought to haue anye primacie. Procede we then to their other arguments. Christ sayde vnto <HI>Peter,</HI> féede my lambes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. 21. Note how this place is peruerted.</NOTE> féede my shéepe, féede my shéepe: therefore <HI>Peter</HI> is the heade of the Apostles. I wéene this be to headie an argument, in the iudge∣ment of any reasonable man, to be graūted. Of Logique I will no more speake, for as all men may sée, they eyther vtterly lacke it, or else they want good matter therein to vt∣ter it, or both. Shall it follow, bicause Christ bade <HI>Peter</HI> féede his sheepe, that therefore he is the heade of the Apostles? what is it to féede Christ his shéepe? is it anye thing else than to preach the Gospel, and so to instruct men in the faith? sayde he not then asmuch vnto the rest? <HI>hos numero. 12. emisit Iesus,</HI> Christ<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 10.</NOTE> sent forth euerie of the twelue to preache, <HI>ad oues perditas,</HI> to call home the strayed shéepe, to féede them.

<PB N="27" REF="39"/>
vnto <HI>Peter,</HI> which he gaue not vnto all the rest, he sent them all to preache the Gospell, to féede his shepe. But why would the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> haue <HI>Peter,</HI> so plain∣ly against the scriptures to be the principal or chiefe among the Apostles? <HI>latet anguis in herba,</HI> there is a pad in the strawe: it is not be ye assured, to further <HI>Peter,</HI> it is nothing for <HI>Peters</HI> sake: it is to the intent that he himselfe (O prowde man!) might chalenge a superioritie ouer all. This is the cause that these blinde arguments came forth, that the scriptures be so wrested, abused, and belyed. Againe, they thus reason. Christ sayth vnto<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 17. Wey howe this place is wrested.</NOTE> <HI>Peter,</HI> thou shalt finde in the fish his mouth a péece of coyne of foure drammes, paye that for me and thée: therefore <HI>Peter</HI> hath a pri∣macie ouer all the Apostles. A perfite argu∣ment I warraunt you, if it be throughlye weyed: there was neuer such absurd toyes, neuer such boyish brawling, I dare saye, de∣uised. Doth, I pray you, Christ, bicause hée then payed tribute, chalenge vnto himselfe, therefore anye power, did not as manye as were at <HI>Capernaum</HI> pay the tribute of two drammes? did anye one of them thereby claime an authoritie? how shall <HI>Peter</HI> then
<PB REF="40"/>
hereby haue any superioritie? is it bicause Christ payd for him two grotes? good God, a great manye, yea all, (they must needes graunt) payd at <HI>Capernaum,</HI> for their ser∣uants the like tribute, and yet did they not therfore attribute vnto their men any chiefe dignitie. The truth is mightie, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dem. ex o∣rat. de fal. legat.</NOTE> contrarie is weake: the truth hereof is, <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> had neuer a pennie, and therfore Christ with that one coyne, least he shoulde be an offence vnto them, payd for him. This is the right sense, there is no more in it to séeke. What can be plainer than this? what can be more peruerse, than to shadow with lies, with lewdnesse so manifest a truth? But O the great strength of veritie, which a∣gainst<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cicer: pro M.

<PB N="28" REF="40"/>
against them such foolish and self will argu∣ments. Neuer saye that they are learned, ex∣cept they haue some better learning. But I maruayle not so much at their blindnesse, I haue bene in it, I know therof the effects. If I wondered at any thing, it shoulde be at this, that there are amongst so many men, not so much as one eye. Neyther speake I of corporall eyes, but of those rather which Aungels haue, the eyes of vnderstanding, the eyes wherewith God is séene, where∣with his holy worde is vnderstanded. Now touching this place of Scripture, whereas Christ sayd vnto <HI>Peter,</HI> that Satan desired to sift them, as it were Wheate, the ryght meaning (marke well indifferent Reader) thereof is, that our Sauiour Christ percey∣uing the time of his passion to approche, and vnderstanding the frailtie, temptation and feare that his Apostles should then be in, he sayd: <HI>all you shall bee offended through</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marc. 14.</NOTE> <HI>me this night, for it is written: I will smite the shepherde, and the sheepe shall be scattered▪</HI> Sée here howe plainly the E∣uangelist S. <HI>Marke</HI> setteth forth that place of S. <HI>Luke.</HI> The shepehearde is Christ, the shéepe are the Apostles, at his taking they

scattered: <HI>relicto illo, omnes fugerunt,</HI> they left<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> him in the handes of his aduersaries, and fled awaye. This is it that Satan desired to sift thē. What followeth? but I haue praied<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 22.</NOTE> for thée (vnto <HI>Peter</HI> he sayth) that thy faith fayle not. And what gather wee of these wordes: forsooth, that Christ séeing, consi∣dering, yea, vttering the estate to come of <HI>Peter,</HI> that is, how in that day he should de∣nie him thrise, and that before the Cocke crewe, he thought it necessarie also, as néed∣full it was, that <HI>Simon</HI> by name should re∣ceyue some words of comfort, that he should vnderstand, though through feare he denied him, that yet his faith shoulde not so fayle, but that in hart still he would acknowledge him to be the sonne of the liuing God, and though that through frayltie he did fall, yet should he through due repentance be raysed vp againe, and so should not his faith fayle. There followeth also in the same place: <HI>and when thou art cōuerted, make more</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>constant thy brethren.</HI> That is, after thou hast denied me, after thou hast bitterly wept and repented, call then togither thy brethrē, call those that are fled, confirme them, tell them that you all haue done euil, will them

nowe with thée to repent and to be sorie. Such is the sense of that text, it soundeth (you sée) in no wise to any superioritie. And touching the authoritie of binding and lo∣sing, as it was giuen vnto <HI>Peter,</HI> so was it vnto all the rest, and that without anye ex∣ception. For our Sauiour speaking vnto them al (as S. <HI>Iohn</HI> witnesseth) saith thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan.</NOTE> <HI>whose sinnes soeuer yee remit, they are remitted vnto them, and whose sinnes so euer yee retain, they are retayned.</HI> Saint <HI>Mathew</HI> recordeth the same, his wordes bee plaine, the sense is euident, the meaning is manifest, what would you more? S. <HI>Paule</HI> himselfe (a thing to bee marked) being ac∣cused before. <HI>Festus,</HI> there and then appea∣led not vnto <HI>Peter,</HI> but vnto <HI>Caesar,</HI> shew∣ing thereby vnto vs, that in causes, accusa∣tions and controuersies, it is not vnto the Pope, but vnto the Prince that we ought to appeale. Wherefore these thinges with an vpright iudgement, with an honest consci∣ence considered, how, by what meanes, shall the Popes primacie be defended? the foun∣dation thereof is pride, the fruite is poyson, it can not be praysed. Reason is wholye a∣gainst it, good authorities do earnestly with∣stand
<PB REF="42"/>
it, and holye scripture doth altogither denie it. If good reason therefore maye take place, if right authorities can preuayle, if sa∣cred Scripture shall ouercome, who is he now, where is any that will maintaine, de∣fend, vphold, or assist either the Pope, or his feyned, painted, hollow Popedome? I will therfore conclude, yea, the kings of the earth (as sayeth the Prophet <HI>Esay</HI>) doe one after another conclude and say: <HI>How happeneth</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 14.</NOTE> <HI>it, that the oppressor leaueth off? is the golden tribute come to an end? art thou wounded also, as wee? art thou become like vnto vs? thy pompe and thy pride is gone downe to hell.

<P>Here séeing then that the chiefest bulwark of vnbeliefe is battered downe, séeing the gate of <HI>Babilon</HI> is broken, séeing that the very seate of <HI>Lucifer</HI> is defaced, séeing hys prowde pallace is ouerthrowen, wée maye briefly speake of the braunches, which, sayd we nothing, the roote being destroyd, would

else of themselues in verie short time fayle, die, wither, and decaye. For if the Pope bée put downe, how can dreaming Purgatorie stande? how can his Bulles liue? how can his Pedlars, and his Pardons preuayle? of these things, and of such others, I meane as briefly, so in plaine wise, and indifferent∣ly to speake. Yet first I sée it needefull, that we aunswere vnto certaine obiections now bellowing in the throtes of the aduersaries, that so their vaine dartes and foolish reasons throughly weied, they acknowledging their disease, maye with a more moderation of mynde with vs consider, what things they be, whence they came, and wherevnto they tende, whereof we haue to treate. Shall we<NOTE PLACE="marg">An ob∣iection.</NOTE> (saye they) mislike the fayth which our fa∣thers professed when we were borne? if the common people which knowe not the lawe, and are accursed, doe follow this newe doc.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. 7.</NOTE> trine, shall we be also seduced? doth any of y<SUP>e</SUP> chiefe Rulers, of the Lords, of the Lawyers, or of the learned beleeue it?

<PB REF="43"/>
he was borne, he had not bene worthie to haue the name of an Apostle of Christ: if <HI>Peter,</HI> if <HI>Barnabas,</HI> if the rest had not forsa∣ken the rites and lawes then vsed whē they were borne, and which their forefathers helde and kept, they had neuer bene accoun∣ted the Disciples and followers of Iesus. Touching the common people, you knowe how the Pharisies foolishlye obiected by the same wordes, the selfe same thing against our sauiour. And as you saye: these Protes∣tants be mad, they haue no learning, so sayd they: <HI>turba haec non nouit legem, execrabiles sunt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. 7.</NOTE> <HI>these foolish people know not the lawe, they are accurst.</HI> But let the Pharisies, let their followers speake what them list, wée must saye: <HI>nunquam sic loquutus est homo sicut hic homo,</HI> there is no preaching like vnto the Gospell, there was neuer man that set forth such doctrine, there is none that may be com∣pared vnto this. S. <HI>Augustine</HI> before his conuersion vnderstanding that the poore Christians did preuaile and now somewhat better liking their doctrine, sayth: <HI>Quid pa∣timur? <HI>what suffer wee?</HI> surgunt indocti, &amp; rapiunt coelum, &amp; nos cum nostris scientijs dimer∣gimur in profundum, <HI>the vnlearned doe rise</HI></HI>
<PB N="31" REF="43"/>
<HI>vp, and they get heauen: but we with all our knowledgesse are drowned in darke∣nesse.</HI> Let none therefore alleadge that wee are vnlearned, for were wée so, <HI>indocti rapi∣unt coelum,</HI> these vnlearned, these foolish pro∣testants doe get heauen. It is they which by persecution be encreased, and by suffering of fire, water, and sworde are so multiplied, that they may well say: <HI>magna est veritas, &amp; praeualet, <HI>mightie is the truth, and shee o∣uercommeth.</HI></HI> And concerning the chiefe rulers (right great praise be therefore vnto God.) They were not of a long time so de∣sirous to heare the truth, nor so willinglye to embrace it as nowe. If some be yet clog∣ged, if their eyes be not opened, what mar∣uaile? When the Prophet <HI>Ieremie</HI> percei∣ued that the people would not repent, what sayd he? <HI>for sit an pauperes sunt,</HI> peraduenture<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieremi. 5.</NOTE> they are foolish and simple, they vnderstand not the Lordes way: <HI>ibo igitur ad optimates,</HI> I will goe therefore vnto their heades, and rulers, vnto the chiefe, <HI>&amp; ecce magis hi simul confregerunt iugum, ruperunt vincula,</HI> but loe, these in like maner haue rather broken the yoke, and burst the bandes in sunder, these are worse than y<SUP>e</SUP> other. How say you now?
<PB REF="44"/>
what speake you of the chiefe and Rulers? as for the learned, I will confesse the truth, there are in the ministerie men verie simple and of small vnderstanding, I knowe of thē a number, I wil not denie it, the thing may in time be remedied: but to speake indiffe∣rentlye, if we examine the ministerie with the former prelacy, they are as learned now, yea, better learned than euer they were. For in times past, what say you vnto Priestes, what say you vnto Bishops that coulde not speake anye true Latine? Let none thinke that I slaunder them, they were such, and therfore to excuse themselues, thus they say: <HI>If the Bishops or Preistes doe speake a∣misse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dist. 38. &amp;c</NOTE> <HI>through ignorance in Grammer, they maye not bee therefore despised of schollers</HI> (no marrie) <HI>bicause the faultes are rather to bee aduoyded in maners, than in wordes:</HI> A proper matter, and an arche argument be ye assured.

And what is y<SUP>e</SUP> cause of this mischief? let vs be indifferent, let vs tell troth. Satan for∣sooth of a long time hauing the world vnder his clawes, was quiet, without care, he was negligent. Then loe, though most horrible vices raigned, yet had they eyther the title of
<PB REF="45"/>
vertues, or else had the people no eies to dis∣cerne them, so that Satan was <HI>animi securi homo,</HI> one that feared nothing, he néeded not to be busie, a better trade than he had, coulde he neuer haue. For Superstition had put on the name of Religion, hawtinesse was ter∣med holynesse, tyrannie was called a zeale vnto iustice, whoredome was named chasti∣tie, and (as <HI>Gregorie</HI> sayth) <HI>vitia virtutes se esse mentiuntur,</HI> vile vices reported thēselues to be vertues, suche was the wretchednesse (O miserie / ) of the time. But in these days Satan being pinched, mens eyes opened, darkenesse remoued, vices defected, and the deuill in a maner naked, howe on euery side besturreth he himselfe? he bloweth abrode his poyson, he scattereth euerye where hys newes, he calleth vnto him his mates, it standeth him vpon, he maketh all the trou∣bles that may be. And what of all this? is it a thing straunge? or is not a thing always séene, that when the Gospell is preached, then Satan is most moued. <HI>For the deuill</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrysost.</NOTE> <HI>hearing that the sonne of god descended into this world,</HI> hearing the fayth of Christ preached, <HI>he made great haste against him to shut vp mens harts in sinne and infi∣delitie,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>
<HI>thinking that he coulde destroye as much, as Christ was able to saue.</HI> For example therof, what should I speake of the persecution in the primatiue Church? it shal suffice, if I set before you but a péece of the wickednesse, and of the lamentable estate of y<SUP>e</SUP> Romaine Empire beginning anon after <HI>Marcus.

at this time the Gospell was preached, wée may not say that the doctrine was not ther∣fore good, bicause the time ouer flowed with iniquitie.

word to be made a warde, a couering, and a bolstering of iniquitie. Did the Apostles of Christ euer heare of any such place? heard they once of the name of Purgatorie? no, for it was long after (will the defenders thereof saye) before it was borne and chris∣tened. <HI>Our forefathers</HI> (saye they) <HI>more</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Allen in the defence of Purga∣torie.</NOTE> <HI>than a thousande yeares since called it Purgatorie.</HI> In déede they had néede at the length to name it, béeing of so long a tyme before namelesse, but who was Godfather? y<SUP>e</SUP> Pope himself.

Iesus Christ, which gaue himself for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Titus. 2.</NOTE> vs, to redéeme vs from all vnrighteousnes, and to purge vs a peculiar people vnto him selfe, we feruentlye being giuen vnto good workes.

Consider this, it is a more holesome doctrine, than to hunt we know not where, after a hatefull, phantasticall and foolish pretenced Purga∣torie. Thus by the wordes of the Prophet, séeing they may not preuaile, seeing that the same is altogither against them, let vs like∣wise▪ sée what y<SUP>e</SUP> Apostle sayth.

<HI>receyue a rewarde.

Here the Apostle would haue vs to be feruent in good workes, and earnest to doe well, hée wisheth vs to bee occupied in that labour, which, when the iudge of all shall come, may in his sight be acceptable, may to vs ward be commendable. And that we should well beware, what workes we builde vppon our foundation, he plainlye sheweth, that at the last day all our doings shalbe opened, and that then the same shall be so tried, as the Goldsmith in fining hys mettals, trieth out the drosse and base mat∣ter, from the pure, perfite, and fine. <HI>The day</HI> (sayth he) <HI>of our Lorde shall declare it,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>bicause it shall appeare in fire.</HI> The daye of our Lorde is the daye of iudgement, the thing is so plaine, as no man, though he be very peruerse, may denie it.

it appere in fire? euen then, at the generall iudgement, so is the text. Where is therfore in y<SUP>e</SUP> meane time, their place of Purgatorie? Well, will you sée in fewe wordes, what by the whole text is ment? Here this onelye is spoken of those, which shall be saued, of such as builde vppon Iesus Christ, vppon which foundation, as all can not builde golde, precious stones and siluer, as all can not be perfite, neyther by martyrdome bée crowned, nor yet by good learning shine like the starres ofheauen: so thereon building, be it but Wood or Haye, be it but verie stub∣ble, though y<SUP>e</SUP> work it selfe be in the end bur∣ned, though he himselfe receiue no such re∣ward, as the others, yet shal he be saued, and how? <HI>as it were through fire.</HI> Not through<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> fire, but through the great feare, wherin he then shall stande, of the iust iustice &amp; iudge∣ment of God. O how comfortable is this doctrine? how farre passeth it al their pain∣ted fires and feyned flames of Purgatorie? You sée now that the Scripture admitteth no such place, you see the right meaning as∣well of the Prophet, as also of the Apostle, You sée that their two chiefe and onely pla∣ces, doe serue so to their purpose, that they
<PB REF="50"/>
stand plainely and altogither against them. Howe shall then poore Purgatorie stande? how shall the Pope mayntayne his chiefe Farme? Howe shall therein his might, his gaine be befended? to what purpose shoulde we cloke the matter anye lenger? his eui∣dences be all naught, his writings be coun∣terfeyte, his lease is antedated, his witnes∣ses be prooued partiall, and periured, his Lawyers haue lost their credite, his interest is not good, it is the Lord of hostes that sueth him, the iudgement (<HI>se iudice</HI>) must passe a∣gainst him. But we see (say the Purgatori∣ans) the name of Purgatorie often set forth by auncient writers. And what I praye you of that? what gathered they, what meaned they by that name? forsooth, so farre were they from confessing anye such Purgatorie fire, which now men so foolishly séeke to de∣fende, that <HI>some sayde the tribulation of</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Allen. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>this life, and world, must trie mens faith and works: some said the griefe of mind in loosing that which they ouermuch lo∣ued, was the burning fire of mans affec∣tions: some woulde haue the grieuous vexation of departure out of this life to be a Purgatorie paines: some construed</HI>

deuour him with their mouthes. Vnto these doth S.

But that the aduersaries maye throughlye be sa∣tisfied, that the indifferent and welwilling maye rightly be instructed, shall we sée in what wise S. <HI>Paule</HI> receiued this instituti∣on at our Lords hands? <HI>That which I de∣liuered you, the same I receiued</HI> (sayeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">I. <HI>Cer.</HI> II.</NOTE> he) <HI>of the Lord. For the Lorde Iesus the same night in which hee was betrayed, tooke Bread, gaue thanks, and brake it, saying: take, and eate, this is my bodye, which shalbe giuen for you, this do ye in the remembrance of me. After the same maner he tooke the Cuppe when supper was done, and sayd: this Cup is the new testament in my bloud, this doe as oft as you shall drinke it, in the remembrance of me. For as often as you shall eate this Breade, and drinke this Cup, you shall shewe the Lordes death vntill he come.</HI>
<PB REF="52"/>
<HI>Therfore whosoeuer shal eate the Bread, and drinke the Cuppe of our Lord vn∣worthily, he shall be guiltie of the bodie and bloud of our Lord. Wherefore let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of that Breade, and drinke of that Cuppe.</HI> Thus farre speaketh S. <HI>Paule,</HI> and that verie plainly. Nowe come we then to the search of the text. And first, let those who will acknowledge there no breade, way but indifferently the words as they stand. Christ tooke Breade, he gaue thanks, and brake it. What brake he? Breade. Who will denie it? He sayde that it was his bodie. That is true: but howe? not fleshly but spiritually. <HI>It is</HI> (sayth Christ) <HI>the spirit that quicke∣neth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. 6.</NOTE> <HI>the fleshe profiteth nothing, the wordes that I spake vnto you, are spirite and life.</HI> Lo, how euidently he aunswereth the cogitations of such, as thought that they should haue eaten him carnally. Hence it is that S. <HI>Augustine</HI> thus saith: <HI>The first he∣resie</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. in exposition. Psalm. 8.</NOTE> <HI>sprang amongest the Disciples of Christ, as it were through the hardnesse of hys words. For when he sayd, except one will eate my fleshe, and drinke my bloud, he can not haue lyfe euerlasting.</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>
<HI>They here not vnderstanding, sayde one vnto another, this is a hard saying, who can eate him? and whiles they thus said, they separated themselues from him, and he remayned with twoo disciples, whom, when the other were gone, he in∣structed. It is the spirite</HI> (sayth he) <HI>which giueth life, the flesh profiteth nothing. The wordes that I spake vnto you, are spirite and life. You haue vnderstoode spiritually, so they are spirite and lyfe: You haue vnderstoode carnallye, so yet are they spirite and lyfe. But vnto thee they are not spirite and life, which vn∣derstandest them not spiritually. Vnder∣stande yee spiritually the wordes that I spake vnto you. You shall not eate thys bodie which you see, neyther shall you drinke the bloud, which those that cru∣cifie me shall shed. I haue cōmended vn∣to you a kinde of sacrament, which be∣ing spiritually vnderstanded, doth quic∣ken you, but the flesh profiteth nothing. But as they vnderstode, so they aunswe∣red. For they vnderstoode fleshe, as that which is solde and broken in the sham∣bles. But Christ perceyuing this, sayde:</HI>
<PB REF="53"/>
<HI>This offendeth you, bicause I sayde: I giue you my fleshe to eate, and my bloud to drinke. If therefore you shall see the sonne of man ascende thither where hee before was, what is this? Here lo hath he plainly declared that, which before had moued them, here he opened, whence they were offended, here in deede and plainly if they had vnderstoode it. But they thought that he would giue his bo∣die vnto them. He sayd, that he would ascend into heauen, and that all whole. When you shall see the sonne of man to ascende where he was before, truly then shall you specially see that he giueth not his bodie in such maner as you thinke: or then you shall vnderstande, that hys grace is not consumed with mouthes. Vntill the ending of the world, the Lord is aboue, but yet here is notwithstanding with vs the grace of the Lorde, for the bodie wherein he rose, can be but in one place, yet his grace, his Godhead, his di∣uinitie is spreade euerye where.</HI> O howe plaine, howe full, howe manifest be these wordes! the naturall bodye of Christ that was borne of the virgin Marie, is, and
<PB N="41" REF="53"/>
must be in one place, and that in heauen, vntill the ending of the world: therefore his naturall bodie can not be here also in earth, it can not be in the material Church, on the altar, in y<SUP>e</SUP> Priests hands. Concerning their consecration &amp; transubstantiation, I aske of them what they do consecrate, whether it be bread, or y<SUP>e</SUP> Lords body? if it be bread, then is<NOTE PLACE="marg">The body of Christ is not conse∣crated, nor yet the bread. Aske them then, what is consecra∣ted?</NOTE> it not y<SUP>e</SUP> bodye of Christ, if it be his body, can they make it holyer at one time, than at an other? is his bodie at anye time vnholye? Herevnto they may neuer well aunswere, their <HI>in instanti</HI> may stand nothing to their purpose. I am loth here to heape the innu∣merable heresies wherein they are, which would defend this carnall eating. Their in∣constancie, their disagréementes, their er∣rors be maruailous. For example, and that I séeme not to belye them, I will betray one of their absurdities. It is in question a∣mongst them (so carnall they be, such <HI>Cau∣phernaites</HI> they are) whether the bodie of Christ may be receiued with his deitie and soule or not? <HI>H:</HI> sayth that neither the soule nor deitie is there receiued: others, as <HI>B:</HI> do saye, that in receiuing the body, they receiue also the deitie and soule. O Lorde what in∣tollerable,
<PB REF="54"/>
what horrible controuersies what hainous absurdities be these? It were hartilye to be wished of euerie honest hart, that these would giue ouer, thus carnallye to grinde vpon Christ his soule, vppon his bodie and deitie. And if they cannot be qui∣et, without altercation in the true faith, then it is rather to bée suffered, that they wrangle (as a number of them do and haue done) about <HI>sum, es, fui: hic, haec, hoc: qui quae quod &amp;c.</HI> For by the one, they set forth much and outragious impietie: by the other they bewray but their iangling nature and great follie.

and aunswering, with trifling and linge∣ring, with light questions, common talke, and controlling. Well, Christ (saye they) said, this is my body: why shall not we then beleue him? forsooth, that you would beleue him, we verilye doe wishe: and that you woulde take heede of that herefie, <HI>which</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> <HI>happened, as it were through the harde∣nesse of his wordes,</HI> amongst his owne dis∣ciples, we earnestlye admonishe, perswade and exhort you. It is vndoubtedly true, that the holye Communion doth consist of twoo things, of the visible kinde of Elementes, of breade and wine, and of the inuisible grace. Of which twoo things, the spirituall body of Christ consisting, is receyued of the worthie receyuer, to his comfort and salua∣tion. Neyther yet may you here thinke, that his spirituall bodie consisteth of breade, but that by the receyuing of breade, we be made to vnderstande of the receit of his spirituall fleshe, and by the receiuing of wine, we are certified to receaue (and all for our instruc∣tion) his spirituall bloude: or if you will haue it brieflier, to receyue his bodye and bloud spiritually. And that this is the Ca∣tholike faith, S. <HI>Hierome</HI> shall beare me

witnesse: <HI>Two wayes is the flesh of Christ</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Epist. ad Ephesios.</NOTE> <HI>and his bloud vnderstanded: either that spirituall and diuine, whereof he sayth: my flesh is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede, and except you will eate my flesh, and drinke my bloud, you shall not haue lyfe euerlastyng: or else that fleshe which was crucified, and that bloud which was shed with the speare of the souldier.</HI> What words can be playner than these? who is so simple, but may now sée, of what fleshe and of what bloude Christ ment, when he sayde, <HI>My fleshe is meate in deede?</HI> here further to aunswere such, who thinke it to be his carnall bodye, bicause he sayde, this is my bodie, I thinke there is no reasonable bodye, that will sup∣pose it néedefull. Yet to auoyde all that the aduersaries maye alledge, whereas he cal∣leth it once his body, he many times nameth it bread, so doe the Apostles, so doe the Doc∣tors. His body it is, in respect of his spiritual flesh and bloud, which then the faithfull doe receiue: but bread and wine it is, in respect of the Elementes, which we eate, taste off, and digest. Also whereas the Doctors doe somtimes not speake of the bread and wine,

but of the verie bodie of Christ, <HI>quod in ipsae</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Augustin.</NOTE> <HI>veritate spiritualiter manducatur &amp; bibitur, <HI>which in deede is spirituallye eaten and dronke:</HI></HI> that do they y<SUP>t</SUP> rather to moue men to lift vp their hartes, &amp; to stirre them from the thinking on those signes, to think vpon the thing signified, to remember that it is not in the bread fixed, which must féede vs, but that by faith we be fed from aboue, from heauen, whence we receiue of the Lord, the Cup of the newe Testament, whence wée receiue verilye Christ his bodie, by whome we liue, and are made flesh of his fleshe.

of his duetie: therefore he was not skilfull in holy Scriptures. What part of this argument could <HI>Gregorie</HI> nowe aun∣swere? what part can anye <HI>Gregorian</HI> dis∣proue?

The name of fasting is not to be considered, the maner and order is diligentlye to be weyed. In <HI>Armenia</HI> which is a region in <HI>Asia,</HI> the people fast so streightly, that therein they passe the Pope and all his Prelacse. And yet is all their fas∣ting not worth one farthing. The Turkes also, they fast, and that most straightly, one moneth in euery yeare, and a wéeke. But is it thinke you, true fasting? doth it to their soules warde anye thing preuayle? No. I dare boldly affirme it. The maner of fasting in times paste was peruerse, it was not right. For what auayleth mée to fast from

flesh, if I eate excesse of fishe, or to fast from fish, if I abounde with daintie and delicate foode? If I only fast vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> Friday, hauing no regard therevnto on the Thursday, is it to be thought that I do well? if I fast in the Lent, &amp; feast at all times else, what helpeth it? if I abstain from all kind of meates, if I weare on sackcloth, if I wallow in ashes, if I would be séene therein vnto the worlde, I am but an Hipocrite. <HI>When you fast</HI> (sayth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 58.</NOTE> the holy Prophet <HI>Esay) your lust remay∣neth still. Ye fast to strife and debate. Ye fast not, that your voice might be heard aboue. Thinke ye that this fast pleaseth me?</HI> In the reast of this Chapiter, doth the lord set forth what kind of fasting we should vse. Togither with our fasting, we must re∣lease the prisoner, breake the othe of wicked bargains, succour the oppressed, and relieue the poore.

<HI>from all thy precepts and iudge∣ments.</HI> But the <HI>Armenians,</HI> the <HI>Turkes,</HI> the Pope, with all his adherents will none of this. The dayes wherein they fast, must be knowen vnto the worlde, from what they fast must be proclaimed, what holinesse they be of, must be euerie where published, their time of sadnesse must bée promulgated.

We will them in their fasting, to shunne the rite and trade of Hipocrites. We exhort them to ioyne vnto their fasting, prayer, and almes déedes.

Concerning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penance.</NOTE> penance or repentance, which they apply ra∣ther to the bodie, than to the mynde, howe ignorantlye they therein deale, it is mani∣fest. Their barefoote abuses were great, their gadding vnto pilgrimages was horrible, their hearing and bewraying of secretes, their presumption in pardoning of offences, was intollerable. So farre were they from true repentance, that they had pointed it in wordes onelye, outwarde meanes, and in dayes. For did not a thousand thinke, if they had gadded to this or that Pilgrimage, that then they were perfite? if they fasted certain dayes, thought they not their sinnes to bée forgiuen? if they had confessed their faults vnto the Priest, thought they not thēselues wholy discharged? yea, and which is most abhominable, bought they not repentaunce with money? was it not solde them? had they it not for twentie pence, for ten pence,

for twoo pence? some receiued twentie dayes pardon, some thirtie, some fortie. O filthye merchandise! Well. What was further taught by ignoraunt and vnlearned men, touching penance, I neede not to say.

After that Heauen and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, were made, after the creation likewise of man, the Lord God cast a slumber on <HI>Adam</HI> and of one of his ribbes he made a woman, and then he sayde: <HI>For this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother, and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 2.</NOTE> <HI>cleaue vnto his wyfe, and they shall bee one flesh.</HI> Such was the first estate of ma∣riage, it was instituted in Paradyse.

This holye institution was so al∣lowed of all, and euery where with such sin∣ceritie receiued, that if a man should be foūd lying with a woman that had a wedded<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 52.</NOTE> husbande, then they both shoulde be put to death.

we procéede, I thinke we shall proue aswel the Pope, as those which ouer popishly doe take his part, to be accurst. The argument is made, if we saye: that the Pope and his adherentes doe so thinke, and for that cause mislike his ministering: therefore they bée accurst. Such is the conclusion. In this ar∣gument, if they denie any thing, it must bée their owne Proposition, which was made at a generall Councell, by the aduise of so manye fathers. <HI>Gregorie</HI> the Pope and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno do∣mini. 1073.</NOTE> seauenth of that name, who vsurped vnto himselfe (as some doe write) the authoritie, kept a great sturre, and laboured earnestly to forbid the mariage of Priestes. But the whole Clergie resisted him, in so much that the Popes deputie in that behalfe, the Bis∣shop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> had great a doe, much trou∣ble, and no small perill in dealing therein. So odious vnto all was the prohibition of matrimony, so vsurped, yea, so wicked then, séemed that deuilish doctrine.

but that either their fathers were ma∣ried, or else that they were filthie fornica∣tors, and verie lesude liuers? Concerning the Apostles, specially such as were maried, is it to be thought, thinke you, that they ne∣uer came where their wiues were? the Popes friends say, they came not. And how prooue they it? forsooth, bicause there is no mention thereof made in the Scriptures. A proper proofe. Bicause we reade onelye by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 8.</NOTE> name, of <HI>Peters</HI> mother in law, which laye sicke in his house, therefore shall we thinke that she lay succourlesse? that her daughter was gone? that there was none in the house but she?

vsed in these later dayes, euen in lesse than sixtene yeares past? why were at that time the maried Priestes separated from their wiues? bicause (sayth the Pope) their mariage was no mariage, bicause they were adulterers.

But though he be dead, doe not his writings yet liue? wrote he not against this before he died? yes.

doe, as the rule of iustice is, vvri∣ting vnto vs, vve graunt. Pervse the chronicles, and if you haue neglected the thing you reade, that vvhich vvee alledge, you shall finde it there. But of those vvhich belong vnto God by a∣doption, and doe holde anye Kingly thing of vs, vvhy maye not vve demaund homage, and othe due vnto a prince? seeing the appointer of vs, and of you, receyuing nothing of a man that is a king, but yeelding eue∣rie good thing vnto al, payd for himselfe and for Peter, the tri∣bute due vnto Caesar, giuing therby vnto you example to do

the like, and so he teacheth you saying: learne of mee, for I am meeke, and humble in heart. VVherefore let such eyther re∣store vnto vs our princelye pos∣sessions, or if they adiudge these things profitable, let them pay vnto God that vvhich is Gods, and vnto Caesar that vvhich is his.
