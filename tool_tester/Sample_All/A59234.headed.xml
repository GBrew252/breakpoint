<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Ere it absolutely necessary for him that would write of Eloquence to be perfectly e∣loquent, I would easily con∣fesse myself too rash in this enterprise: But having seen often those treat know∣ingly of painting that never held Pencil, and <HI>Cicero</HI> remarking that <HI>Aratus,</HI> by the common consent of learned men, wrote excellently of the Heavens and Stars, though he was no noted Astronomer; I'm encourag'd to say, why then may not I too discourse of Eloquence without be∣ing an Oratour? <HI>Galen,</HI> that great Ma∣ster of Physick, who wrote so learnedly of every part of that Science, was little seen in the Practick; Nor are those that discourse best of the embattailing Ar∣mies, and differencing Military functi∣ons, alwayes the best Warriers, or the
<PB REF="4"/>
most daring. The like may happen in this Subject, that he, who is able to set down the rules and laws which ought to be observed in speech or style, may notwithstanding find himself defective in the application; and so may be said to give that to others, which he hath not himself: But this Treatise indeed may not so properly be termed a Di∣rection to the Art of Rhetorique, as a Key to unlock and lay open those abstruse difficulties which the Tropes and Figures have hitherto, not only been masked with, but lock'd up un∣der; I mean from such at least, as are altogether unacquainted with the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue, and have not directed their studies to that subject.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But it may be you will say, there were several books extant before, that much illustrate the Tropes and Fi∣gures of Rhetorique.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is very true, that many learned Worthies have done exceeding well herein; yet to use the expression of one of them: That a child upon a Gyant shoulders can see further then the Gyant: So I, having the help of
<PB REF="4"/>
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir labours, and of other Books, have by Divine assistance (without ostenta∣tion be it mentioned) used a more di∣stinct and easie method throughout the whole current of my Discourse, then any other upon this Subject yet extant; whereby matters of high and excellent sublimity are bowed down to the weak∣est capacities.</P>
<P>I render the English of each Trope and Figure, &amp; likewise the <HI>English</HI> of the words, from whence they are derived, whether from the Greek or Latin, then a brief definition and lively character and representation of each Trope and Figure, then choyse Latin and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The English Examples are most of them streams from Sir <HI>Phillip Sidnyes</HI> fountain.</NOTE> English Ex∣amples pertinent to each of them, as also a brief and plain explanation of the terms used in Rhetorique, with an Al∣phabetical Table for the ready finding each of the Tropes and Figures.</P>
<P>Lastly, For that the holy Scripture is not barren of, but a∣bounds with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="inter">Note that Rhetorique sets for∣ward the end of the discourse, to wit, to affect the heart with the sense of the matter in hand: as Eccl. 1.2. Va∣nity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity, where we may see that it is no vani∣ty to teach the vanity of the crea∣tures in Rhetorical elegancies.</NOTE> tropes and figures of all sorts, as containing the most excellent and sublimest elo∣quence,
<PB REF="5"/>
and is like a pleasant garden, bedecked with flowers, or a fruitful field, full of precious treasures, I ap∣prehended it a work worthy the under∣taking, to dig into those sacred Mine∣rals for the better finding out the Me∣taphors, Metonymies, Synecdoches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which lie hid there, and have given Scriptural Examples pertinent to each of the Tropes and Figures: For the bare reading of the Scripture, without searching into its heavenly mysteries and meaning, is like the coming into a Treasury, wherein we see many costly things folded up, and some ends appear∣ing out, but when they be all unfold∣ed, then doth their glory more affect us for the present, yea, and leave in us a deep impression of their excellency: Besides, the ignorance of Rhetorique is one ground (yea, and a great one) of many dangerous Errors this day; as upon perusal of the Scriptural Examples of Synecdoche, Metonymie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will manifestly appear, where you have not only bare instances, but divers Texts cleared and explained; for though the Spirit of the Lord be indeed that Golden
<PB REF="5"/>
Key, that opens the sealed mysteries of the Book of Truth, and inspires the soul with the understanding of the hidden wisdom therein; and those men, whose understandings are not opened by him who hath the Key of <HI>David,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 24.45.</NOTE> be they never so learned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 29.11, 12.</NOTE> yet by reason of the blindnesse of their hearts, seeing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 3.7.</NOTE> they see not, and hearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4.18.</NOTE> they understand not the wonders in Gods law: yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 8.10.</NOTE> all Science, and particularly, Rhetorique, where it is reduced to a blessed subor∣dination and conformity to the teachings of the Spirit of Truth, is a good gift of God, proceeding from the Father of lights, and very conducent to the unfold∣ing and right understanding of the Figu∣rative and Tropical Elegancies of that blessed Book, which abounds with the most excellent and divinest eloquence:</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mat. 16.26, 27. This is my body, &amp;c. take heed you take not the sign for that whereof it is but a sign.</NOTE> And herein we must beware that we take not those things literally which are to be understood spiritually; that we go not out to a figurative accepta∣tion of any place of Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhere there is a sentence in Scripture which hath a Tropical word, we may n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t think the whole place figurative: as Matth. 26.28. this is my blood which is shed for many, &amp;c.</NOTE> where
<PB REF="6"/>
we have not a sufficient reason (ground∣ed upon some word of truth) why the proper sense or signification of the words may not be adhered unto; for we must never leave off the proper sense, un∣lesse the coherence of the Text, the Analogie of faith, or some other place of Scripture require a figurative Expo∣sition. And it is very dangerous to make figures, where the Scripture makes none; or to make the scope and sense bleed with straining it too hard. <HI>Ori∣gen</HI> would sometimes take that literally, which ought to be understood mysti∣cally, and thus mistaking that place, Matth. 19.12. And there be Eunuches, which have made themselves Eunuches for the Kingdom of heavens sake: he gelt himself; And he also sometimes would allegorize plain Scriptures, that is, such as are to be taken literally, or in their proper signification: But the difference will easily appear to the wise and observant Reader; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The like in Joh. 1.10.4.35. &amp; 4.13, 14</NOTE> Mat. 26.29. <HI>I will not henceforth [drink] of this fruit of the Vine, untill that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom</HI>; where the first word [drink]

hath a proper or literal signification; but the later a Metaphorical, of their Com∣munion, or partaking of the joys of heaven. This work will also be very useful and advantageous to youth, and others, enabling them to find out the elegancy in any Author, and likewise help the invention of learners, who may beautifie a speech, and adorn a discourse with elocution, by drawing their dis∣course through the several Tropes or Fi∣gures, and taking what may best befit their purpose: So I will detain thee no longer in the Porch, but in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite thee into the House, and such as I have, set before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there be no such varieties as were expected; yet, let it have accep∣tance with thee, seeing it is according to my ability; Thus doe, and thou wilt engage him, who is</P>

<P N="2">2. Garnishing of the manner of utterance, called <HI>Pronunciation</HI> (which in this Treatise is not principally aimed at.)</P>

<P>The affections are five, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Catachresis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Catachre∣sis.</HI></NOTE> which is when the Trope is a∣bused, or the words too far wrested from their native signification: as, Hos. 4.8. <HI>They eat up the sins of my people.</HI></P>

<LIST>
<PB N="55" REF="43"/>
<ITEM>1. Natural.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Inferr'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>A natural Allegory is such as is expresly de∣livered in the Scriptures themselves; and this pro∣perly is the mystical sense of the Scripture: as,</P>
<P>Gal. 4.25. For this <HI>Agar</HI> is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answeteth to Jerusalem which now is, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostles meaning here is, that in a my∣stical sense, <HI>Agar</HI> hath some proportion unto Jerusalem, that is unto the Jewes, whose Metro∣polis or chief City Jerusalem was: for, as <HI>A∣gar</HI> the bond-woman obtained a place in <HI>A∣brahams</HI> house, and was at length cast forth thence; so the Jews were in the Apostles time under the servitude of the Law, and for that they would be justified by the works of the Law, were ejected the house of God.</P>
<P>Exod. 34.29. The face of <HI>Moses</HI> shined, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This contains an Allegorical sense which the Apostle explains in 2 Cor. 3.7., 13, 14. But if the ministration of death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was glorious, so that the Israelites could not stedfastly behold the face of <HI>Moses</HI> for the glory of his countenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Glo∣ry of the odl Testa∣ment.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? vers. 14. but their minds were blinded: for untill this day remaineth the same vail. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the reading of the old Testament: which vail is done away in Christ.</P>
<P>The like Allegory you may find if you com∣pare Exod. 12.15, 17. with 1 Cor. 5.7, 8.</P>
<P N="2">2. An Allegory inferr'd, is such as the Scrip∣ture it self shewes not, nor makes manifest, but is brought in by interpreters.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="44"/>Allegories of this kind are like unto pictures; but their literal expositions like to stone-wals; the house hath its strength from the stone-wals, the pictures afford not the least strength either to the house or wals.</P>
<P>This Allegory is either offered, or inforced and wrested:</P>
<P N="1">1. That inferr'd Allegory from Scripture which is offered, hath a probable ground and foundation in the literal sense, and a proporti∣onable agreeablenesse of things, and is likewise agreeable to the Analogie of faith: as,</P>
<P>Gen. 6.14. The description there of the Arke of <HI>Noah</HI> doth allegorically represent Gods spiritual house or Church, which in 1 Pet. 2.5. is said to be built up of living stones; and also denotes the Lords miraculous preservation of that Church of his, so that neither the waves, or strange and pernicious doctrines, or tentations or persecutions can break in upon or drown it.</P>
<P>Gen. 8.11. The Olive leaf represents the Gospel; for in Luk. 10.34 it is evident that oil signifies mercy and peace.</P>
<P>Luk. 15. The prodigal, when absent from his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers house, sound nothing but misery and per∣plexity; which doth Allegorically represent un∣to us, That rest is to be found in the Creator on∣ly, and not in the creature.</P>
<P>So in the whole book of Canticles, the sweet conference between Christ and his Church, is set down in the words and expressions proper to husband and wife.</P>

<P>There are in Scripture nine kinds of questi∣ons (<HI>inter alia</HI>).</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes a question is asked with de∣sire only to receive an answer: as, The Mari∣ners of <HI>Jonas.</HI></P>
<P>Jonas 1.8. Tell us (say they) for whose cause is this evill come upon us? what is thine occu∣pation? and whence comest thou? Such a que∣stion you may finde the wise men made touching Christ, in Matth. 2.2.</P>
<P N="2">2. Interrogations in Scripture are sometimes emphatical and strong affirmations: as,</P>
<P>Gen. 4.7. If thou doe well, shalt thou not be accepted? (<HI>i. e.</HI>) thou a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thy Sacrifice shall both certainly be accepted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Josh. 1.9. Have not I commanded thee? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have without all question assuredly com∣manded thee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>See more examples in Gen. 13.9.37.13. 2 Sam. 13.28. 2 King. 6.32. Joh. 4.35. Mar. 12.24. Jer. 23.23, 24, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 King. 12.19.</P>
<P N="3">3. Interrogations also are sometimes strong and vehement negations: as,</P>
<P>Psal. 19.12. Who can understand his errors? <HI>(i. e.</HI>) no man can understand the depth of them.</P>
<P>Gen. 18.14. Is any thing too hard for God?</P>
<P>Job 8.3, 11. Doth God prevert judgement? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="77"/>See Matth. 12.26. Rom. 3.3, 10, 14, 15. &amp; 8.35.</P>
<P N="4">4. Interrogations sometimes diminish and abate the sense: as,</P>
<P>Zech. 4.7. Who art thou, O great Mountain? before <HI>Zerubbabel</HI> thou shalt be a plain, <HI>&amp;c. (i. e</HI>) Thou lookest very big and great, but who art thou? I will tell thee, oh proud oppressor of my people, though in thy own conceit thou art a Mountain immoveable, yet in my peoples eyes thou art but a Mole-hill, and shall shortly be made a nothing, even as a plain before them.</P>
<P>Thus in 2 Sam. 7.18. <HI>David</HI> when he would abase himself, cryes out; Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto?</P>
<P N="5">5. Interrogations sometimes raise and heigh∣ten the sense by way of admiration: as,</P>
<P>Psal. 8.9. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the world?</P>
<P>Exod. 15.11. Who is a God like unto thee? <HI>&amp;c. (i. e.</HI>) Let all the world (if they can) shew such a God as thou art.</P>
<P>See Mark 7.18. Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? &amp;c. The question here puts the brightest glory upon God in pardoning sin; There is no sin-par∣doning God, but our God only.</P>
<P N="6">6. Interrogations are sometimes expostulato∣ry and complain: as,</P>
<P>Job 3.11, 12. Why dyed I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="78"/>Psal. 22.1. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? &amp;c.</P>
<P>Jer. 12.1. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? so in Isa. 1.21. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. You find in the Scripture doubting que∣stions: as,</P>
<P>Psal. 77.7, 8. Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mer∣cy clean gone for ever? &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. You may also finde teaching questions: as,</P>
<P>Isa. 60.8. Who are these that flie as a clowd, and as the Doves to their windows? This tea∣ches us the multitude of those that shall (when the Angels shall be sent out of the Temple to preach the everlasting Gospel) flock in unto Christ.</P>
<P N="9">9. You may also finde learning questions: as,</P>

<P>Of Questions there are two kinds;</P>

<P><HI>The infinite question</HI> is by the Greeks called <HI>The∣sis,</HI> which signifies also a general argument pro∣posed.</P>

<P>Suppositions in Scripture are no Positions.</P>
<P>When the speech is only <HI>Hypothetical,</HI> it con∣cludes nothing; for a conditional proposition doth not simply affirm; and therefore conclusi∣ons gathered from it, as if it were affirmative, will not hold: as,</P>
<P>Ezek. 18.24. If a righteous man turn away from his righteousnesse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Hence would some conclude that a righteous man may finally fall from grace; but this is no other then a supposition, and so concludes not.</P>

<HEAD>A Brief Explanation of the several Points used by the Learned in their writings, illustrated by particular and pertinent Examples upon each.</HEAD>
<P>FOrasmuch as the Points or Notes used by the Learned in distinguishing writing (though not precisely pertinent to Rhe∣torique) are not the least part of Orthography, or of the right manner of writing: the igno∣rance whereof is frequently not only an obstacle to the discerning of the elegancy in writing, but likewise to the perceiving of the writers scope, drift and sense: It will therefore not be imper∣tinent here to add a few lines in explanation thereof.</P>
<P>The points used by the learned in their wri∣tings are 7, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Comma.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Semi-Colon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A Colon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. A Period.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. A note of Exclamation or Admiration.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. A note of Interrogation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Parenthesis.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Which are particularly and orderly illustrated and exemplified.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Comma, Subdistinctio,</HI> the point in the part of a sentence without perfect sense: A <HI>Comma</HI> or cutting short is a shutting up of the sense, the measure and order in syllables being not filled up,
<PB REF="136"/>
extending from two unto seven syllables, or there∣abouts: or as others define;</P>
<P>It is a note of convenient silence, or rather a place of pausing or taking breath, whereby the bound or limit of pronunciation or utterance (the sense remaining) is so respited, as that which follows ought forthwith to succeed;</P>
<P>It is a short pause, and thus noted —,</P>

<P>By this point or note all the parts of a sen∣tence are distinguished: as,</P>
<P>Embrace in your sweet consideration, I be∣seech you, the misery of my case, acknowledge your self to be the cause, and think it reason for you to redresse the effects.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Colon, Media distinctio,</HI> a mean distinction between a <HI>Comma</HI> and a <HI>Period,</HI> is where there remains almost as much of the sentence to come, as is then past:</P>
<P>Or, as others define it;</P>
<P>It is a part of a Sentence which finishes the sense, shut up in measure and order of syllables, but being pull'd away from a period it defers the hearers expectation, as not perfecting the sen∣tence; and it goes forward from the twelfth to the eighteenth syllable, and sometimes to the twenty fourth: It is a longer stay then the for∣mer, thus noted—:</P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>Periodus plena ac perfecta distinctio,</HI> a peri∣od, a perfect or full point, or distinction; this is to be put at the end of a complete sentence.</P>
<P>That period is the most excellent, which is performed with two Colons (and sometimes Commas) or four parts of a sentence, as that which suspends the mind, and satisfies the ears.</P>
<P>A Period is thus noted—.</P>
<P>Herein beware that the Period be not shorter then the ear expects, nor longer then the strength and breath of the Speaker or Reader may bear, and that it finish its course in a handsome and full comprehension.</P>
