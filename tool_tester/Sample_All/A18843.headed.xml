<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Our in-bred loue of knowledge, e∣qualiz'd with able industrie; and your ap∣plause, and furtherance of a publicke benefit, brought vs ac∣quainted.
<PB REF="5"/>
In that an office free∣ly done to any peculiar person, is very laudable; but exten∣ding it selfe to an vniuersality; obliegeth, and vniteth all men. For, as the mutuall participati∣on of particulars, and their vse, and faculties in a body naturall: So breedeth it, a louing harmo∣ny, and perpetuity, in that which is politicall: harmony of minds, through vniting courtesies; perpetuitie of being so, by an af∣fectionate acceptance, and grate∣full acknowledgement. Where∣upon, there is not onely an ex∣change of fauours, out of the en∣dowments of fortune: but from th'elaborated experience also, of such as are not enuious, pro∣ceedeth a willing demonstration of all, either infused, or acquired sciences; euer binding, by reite∣rated offices, the receiuer to a
<PB REF="5"/>
new addition of thankefulnesse, and the giuer to parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipate through a former deseruing gratitude. And this was the mayne occasion that I, (true friend) breaking the ice of my long concealed blessings, and in∣uentions, laid open to your view those christall, and abounding fountaines, which, who so tast∣eth, so instantly be-deweth his vnderstanding, with so recrea∣ting a Balsamum, that it spring∣eth in the coldest Winter, and is euer fruitfull. This powerfull and celestiall water, is (as you beheld) enuironed with a guard of auncient Authors, of the most admired perfection in all pro∣fessions; and such, as from the riches of their wisedomes, haue left rules, precepts, and autho∣rities; as legacies, regalities, and prerogatiues; by which all after-ages,
<PB REF="6"/>
conditions of men, and do∣minions; haue beene, and must be instituted, maintain'd, and gouerned. All these, though they bewray'd a willingnesse, to embrace you, and graunt you ac∣cesse vnto that fountaine: yet through an auncient familiari∣tie, begunne in childhood, be∣tweene your selfe, and <HI>Cicero,</HI> which was one of them, you sought this courtesie rather from him, and hee gaue rather way thereto, then any other. And as he was euer of an affa∣ble disposition, &amp; had beene well read in the conditions of all men, and, delighted to be fre∣quented, by the most illumina∣ted vnderstandings; hee so ta∣sted your inclination, that, cal∣ling me from clensing, (as my custome is) and purifying that fountaine, he requested me, in
<PB REF="6"/>
token of his affection, to present you with one volume of his E∣pistles. I ask't him which? Hee answered; the Familiar. In what Language? English. Whereat I blush't, and smiled. Hee gathering, mine inward thoughts by mine outward car∣riage, sayd; Blush not to bee made a Translator of so ordina∣rie Bookes as mine Epistles; In that, things the more ordinarie they are; argue the more vni∣uersall acceptance: and besides, men of greater shew, haue held their translations of lesser mo∣ment, for their greatest orna∣ments: But blush to thinke that <HI>Cicero,</HI> whose letters bewray his conuersation, and whose conuersation was with Consuls, Kings, Imperator's, Praetors, Quaestors, Tribunes, Generals, and friends of his owne ranke,
<PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Caesar, Pompeius, Lepidus, Antonius, Brutus, Cassius, Cato, Plancus, Lentulus, Deiotarus, Octauianus,</HI> and such great Potentates; and at that time when all the world was subiect vnto one domini∣on, and himselfe in it a chiefe Commander; I say blush, to conceyte that he, should reduce such Epistles into Volumes, one∣ly for little ones. And wrong not thine owne iudgement so farre, as to imagine, that euery man of thy Nation, and Coun∣trie, which is desirous, and worthy to read mine Epistles, is able to vnderstand them in their originall: goe on then; for those that ruled all men haue beene rul'd by me; be thou then ruled; and goe on. When I heard this, my shamefull blush was turned to a daring bold∣nesse;
<PB REF="7"/>
which made mee replie, Commaund: but, thou art the whole worlds greatest Orator; and I, when these are ended, shall be but a young Translator; Let me bring thee a <HI>Sydney,</HI> a <HI>Great L: Chancellor,</HI> or a <HI>Sandys</HI>; that can parallel thy Latine, with our English Lan∣guage. No, sayd mine Author; they haue done; doe thou. With that, I asked him, how? Hast thou forgotten, sayd hee, that, <HI>Epistolas quotidianis verbis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exere solemus</HI>? Here I grew silent: but not so silent, as pre∣sumptuous; For, hence came these Epistles. Neither did I forget a French <HI>Doletus,</HI> and <HI>Italie's Manutius,</HI> who had dared as much, and were ap∣plauded. But when I was al∣most at an end, and met with, <HI>aliter scribimus, quod <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os so∣los
<PB REF="8"/>
quibus mittimus, aliter quod multos lecturos puta∣mus.</HI> I was absolutely deter∣mined to commend my former labours, to the secretest of all friends, a fire. But you, at that very instant, sent by destinie, repriued them: and requested my patience once more to reade them, and returne you them. 'Tis done, and by these you shall receiue them. Send backe your censure; and Farewell.</P>

<P>THE xiij. of Ianuary the Senate de∣termined nothing: because the greatest part of that day was spent in Controuersies, betweene the Consull <HI>Lentulus,</HI> and <HI>Caninius</HI> Tribune of the people. At which time I also spak much on your behalfe, and by manifest to∣kens

I perceiued, that the Senate tooke wondrous w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, the remembrance of your respect vnto that order. Where∣upon the day following, they were pleased, that I should make a briefe re∣capitulatiō of euery mans opinion: For, they seemed to be reconciled vnto vs: which I perceiued aswell by the plead∣ing of your cause; as by their calling e∣uery man, and requesting their fauour for vs. When therefore the first sen∣tence was pronounced, which was of <HI>Bibulu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that the King should be by three Ambassadours restored; The second, that you should restore him without the Armie, as <HI>Hortentius</HI> desired; or as <HI>Volcatius,</HI> who gaue the third; that <HI>Pomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius</HI> should restore him: It was de∣manded, that the particulars of that o∣pinion of <HI>Bibulus</HI> might be considered. No man opposed that part wherein he touched the Religion; as being a thing not to be contradicted. Touching the three Ambassadors, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st part flue from him. Then followed the o∣pinion of <HI>Horten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius,</HI> vpon which <HI>Lupu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Tribune of the people (because he had made the motion for <HI>Pompeius</HI>) began to contend, that it belonged vnto him rather than to the Cōsuls to command that euery one should goe to that side to which they were most addicted. But his speech was interrupted by the out-cryes of all men: because it was a
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
thing new found out, and without sence or reason. The Consuls neither assen∣ted vnto him, nor were they greatly re∣pugnant. They were contented the day should be thus driuen ouer, and so it was. For they well perceiued that the greatest part would follow <HI>Hortentius:</HI> though they outwardly seemed to al∣low of the opinion of <HI>Volcatius.</HI> Manie were requested to giue their opinion, and that with great vexation of the Consuls, whose desire was that the o∣pinion of <HI>Bibulu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> might be preferred. This controuersie endured till night, and then the Senate rose; and I, as it fell out, supt that night with <HI>Pompeius,</HI> lighting thereby vpon this occasion more fit than heretofore hath beene offered, as being the first Senate day, that hath since your departure prooued fortunate vnto vs. I so reasoned the matter with him, that he seemed to giue credite wholly to my discourse, and to deliberate how he might fauour you. Hearing his own tale, I must needs free him from the least touch of Ambition: but when I consider the carriage or passages of his familiar acquaintance, of what degree soeuer, I finde that assured∣ly true, that at length is manifested to all the world: that all this cause hath beene before this time by some cor∣rupted, and not without the knowledg or priuitie of the King himselfe, and of
<PB N="7" REF="17"/>
his Counsellers. These I wrote the 14. of Ianuarie before day, in which the Senate was to sit. We shall as I hope maintaine our reputation in the Senate so far, as is possible in this so persidious an age, and full of iniustice. As for the popular respects, I thinke we haue so carried things, that nothing can be done with the people, without the vio∣lating of diuine authoritie, or breach of lawes, no nor without compulsion. Yesterday the Senate ratified the things aforesaid, by interposing of their graue authoritie: to which though <HI>Ca∣to,</HI> and <HI>Caninius</HI> opposed themselues, yet it was registred, and I thinke it shall be sent vnto you. I will not faile to giue you good accompt hereafter of euery thing that passeth: and I will en∣gage all my thoughts, endeuours, dili∣gence, and friends, in the effecting this businesse, to our owne contentment.

<P>THough I desire nothing more, than to be knowne first of your selfe, and then to all the world, for a most thankful man, and one that cannot for∣get the good turnes you haue done me; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it grieues me to the heart, that the times since your departure are such, as inforce you to make triall as well of mine, as other mens trust, and affection towards you.

I endeuoured with all my vnderstanding, care, and po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, to bring about the cause of the king; when on the sodaine <HI>Cato,</HI> beyond

all imagination, proposed a wicked law, which did not onely hinder the cause, but hath made that businesse, which was before light, and easie; to be very difficult, and desperate. But, though in so crosse an accident, we are to expect all mischiefe; yet wee feare nothing more than treacherie. Come what will come, let <HI>Cato</HI> be wel assured, we will resist him. About the restoring of the king, I promise you thus much, that I will so bestur me, that you shall rest fully satisfied. Yet I doubt, that ei∣ther the businesse may be taken out of our hands; or that there will be no fur∣ther proceeding in it: and I cannot well determine, which of these two courses will leaft content me. But if it come to this passe; there is a third way which neither <HI>Selicius,</HI> nor I dislike. That we neither suffer the King to be abando∣ned; nor let him be put ouer vnto that man for his restoring, who is alreadie thought, to haue obteined him. We will doe the best we can, that things may goe, as we would haue them: if not; we will so leaue off, that we may suffer no disgrace thereby. It is for a man of your wisedome, vnderstanding and valour; to be well assured, that all your greatnesse, and honour proceedes from your owne vertue, your noble ac∣tions, and graue proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dings, (which will neuer faile you) and to set light by

that, that the perfidiousnesse of any man can detract from you, in any thing wherein fortune hath inriched you. Knowing for certaine, that whatsoeuer is done in that kind, will turne to them more hurtfull, than to you hereafter. There is not an houre passes, but I am either doing something in your busi∣nesse, or contriuing how to doe it. And in euery thing I vse the helpe of <HI>Quintus Selicius</HI>: whom I esteeme as discreete, faithfull, and louing vnto you, as any of your other friends. I make accompt that you haue vnderstood both by fre∣quent letters, and messengers, aswell what we haue now in hand, as that that hath beene hitherto effected. Of that, that is expected, I hold none fitter then my selfe, to send you mine opinion. I haue seene <HI>Pompeius</HI> vpon two occasiōs terribly troubled. First, for that on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>xt of Februarie, speaking to the people in the fauour of <HI>Milo,</HI> they gaue not onely a negligent eare vnto him: but often interrupted him with exclamati∣ons, and villanies: secondly because <HI>Cato</HI> speaking ill of him, in the Senate, and sharply accusing him, had a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t quiet audience: so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it seemes he al∣together shrinketh from this cause of restoring the king, in which we haue alwayes held our owne: the Senate not hauing taken any thing from you here∣in, but that, which by the Religion it

cannot giue vnto another man. Our hope therefore at this present is, that the King finding himselfe decei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in his opinion of thinking to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estored by <HI>Pompeius:</HI> and being depriued of all other hopes herein, will necessarilie applie himselfe vnto you.

But you know how slow he is, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o how silent in all his actions, yet there is nothing, that may be done herein, by vs omitted The other iniuries that <HI>Cato</HI> threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neth to doe vs, shall need (I hope) but easie resistance Of the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulars I find none to fauour you, but <HI>Hortentius,</HI> and <HI>Lu∣cullus.</HI> The rest are partly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, partly open enemies.

that he stroue with you about the resto∣ring of the king.

Therefore know, that whatsoeuer I write, shall be written by his Councell, and opinion. I say then, till now the Senate hath not denied you the restoring of the King. Because that decree, that no man might restore him, was rather made out of furie then by reason; and the Tribunes as you know were thereunto opposed. You therefore hauing the gouernment of <HI>Silicia</HI> and <HI>Cyprus,</HI> may easily informe your selfe, whether your fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces be suffi∣cient to bridle <HI>Alexandria,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and finding it a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter feyseable, you may, goe into <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exandria</HI> with the ar∣mie, leauing the King at <HI>Ptolem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is,</HI> or there bouts, and when you haue set all things quiet, and appointed, and placed your gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>risons, you may restore <HI>Ptole∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> to his former state and Domini∣on. And af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er this manner, he shall be restored by you, as the Senate had in the beginning ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined; and restored without the armie, as these religious persons said, was according to the plea∣sure,

or liking of the <HI>Sibylla.</HI> And you shall thus doe a thing agreeable to the honour of your selfe, and of our Com∣mon-wealth. It is true, that the attempt seemes vnto vs, doubtfull, because wee know men will iudge according to the successe. And, if the matter should fall out as we would haue it, euery man will proclaime you wise, and valorous: If any misfortune should come betweene you and home, all men will say you were vaine, and ambitious. Wherefore, you shall better gather than we, whe∣ther the enterprise be secure, as hauing the estate of all <HI>Aegypt</HI> within your view. Our opinion is, that if you haue any certaintie, to possesse your selfe of that kingdome, that you defer no time in effecting it; but if the case be doubt∣full, put not your selfe vpon it. This I assure you, that if you prosper in it, you shall be in your absence praised of ma∣ny, and at your re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, of all men; if it happen otherwise, I forsee that no∣thing but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll can come thereof.

But as I exhort you, to put your sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e vpon the taske, if you finde things without danger; so if you doubt they will giue you battell: I disswade you from it. And againe I tell you what from the beginning I haue signified vnto you, that men will censure your

actions, not so much according to the counsell you haue embraced, as accor∣ding to the end that shall ensue thereof. But if this way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould appeare dange∣rous vnto you, we should like it well, that the king, (giuing assurance to those friends of yours, which in diuerse pla∣ces of your Prouince, haue furnisht him with moneys;) should vse your ayde to returne into his kingdome.

Which I haue written thus freely vn∣to you, because I acknowledge, not onely my present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state from you, but the beginning of my honour also. And moreouer, because I begin now to be∣leeue, that my obscure paren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age, was not the cause I was so ill beloued: con∣sidering that you, that are bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of a most noble house, could not auoid the rage of these malicious people.

<P>OF all things which concerne you, what is done, determined, and promised by <HI>Pompeius; Emplat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rius</HI> shall to the full enforme you: who hath not onely seene, but sollicited them; and that with so much loue, iudgement, and care, that greater of any friend could no wayes be expected. Of the same man you may vnderstand the state of the weale publique, whose shape by pen can hardly be portraied. But let it su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fice you, that the gouernment is in the managing of our acquaintance, and the common opinion is, that in our time it will not be changed. Where∣fore I, as well for the obligation that I haue to <HI>Pompeius,</HI> as to obey your com∣fortable, and safe Councels; and to maintaine my regained honour, toge∣ther with my prosperitie; I fauour his

You know how full of trouble it is vnto a cittizen to change the habite of his mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, especially when it is good, and such as hath beene by him long time continued. Notwithstanding I applie my selfe to this mans pleasure, not be∣ing able with honestie to gainesay him, neither doe I this as is peraduenture by some enformed, with dissimulation; because a naturall inclination, and loue, which I beare him, can doe so much with me, that I hold all things to be ho∣nest and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue, which are to his profit, and good liki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g. And in my iudgement his aduersaries also should doe well, if (not being able to withstand him) they should cease to contend longer with him. Verily this also giues me comfort, that euery man freely graunteth vnto me, as it were by a speciall priuiledge, either to fauour the disignes of <HI>Pom∣peius</HI>; or to be silent; or to retire me to our common studies, in which I take the greatest pleasure. And if his friend∣ship forbid me not, I will by all meanes doe so; not being able to councell the common-wealth with that freedome I desire; nor with that authority, which I, after so manie troubles susteined in managing the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces of dignitie haue expected.

<P>YOur letters vvere very acceptable vnto me, because I vnderstood [by them] that you apparently perceiue how much I respect you; vvhich had not beene so well expressed, if I said I had loued you, because in my conceit,
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
that name of respect, although it be ex∣ceeding graue and holy; is notwith∣standing of lesse vveight, and of much lesse price, then are the courtesies you haue done me. As for the thankes you render me, nothing hath thereunto more mooued you, then a certaine a∣boundance of affection; which giues occasiō, that you esteeme those things vvhich vvithout my vtter shame, and soule imputation cannot be pretermit∣ted. But if all this time we haue beene separated, we had liued togither, and in <HI>Rome,</HI> I had made more manifest demonstration of my mind vnto you. For vvith equall commendation, in defence of the Common-wealth, vve should haue proceeded in euery action to one, and the selfe same end, and pur∣pose. And I hope it may yet come to passe; asvvell for that, vvhich you giue notice of; as because you can easily performe the same. Of the which I vvill here after giue satisfaction accor∣ding to your d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire, and vvill declare vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o you hovv I am affected, and the state in vvhich I now find my selfe.

Al∣though I am verie glad, (as I ought to be,) to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you are full of glorie in your Prouince, for your late obteined victorie: Yet here you would haue reaped, a better crop of your seede, and more aboūdant. Because I would won∣derously haue helped you, to haue bin reuenged on them, of whom you know there are some, that greatly maligne you, for hauing restored me into my Countrie; other some, that enu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you for the reputation and renovvn, which is fallen vnto you by so noble a fact, and honourable enterprise. Although that wretched villaine, naturall enemie of his friends, vvho vvithout fauour, and depriued of any man to vphold him, in recompence of your especiall fauours done him; bestirred him vvith that feeble force he had, to doe you in∣iurie: Yet hee himselfe in our re∣uenge hath giuen condigne punish∣ment to his owne offences. For such plots of his haue beene discouered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat haue not onely vtterly dishonored him, but during life depriued him of libertie. And although I should hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lik't it better, that you had learned by my example, then by your owne expe∣rience; yet I reioyce in my sorrow, that you haue knowne that faith in men vvith small cost, which I to my great losse haue beene acquainted vvith, and
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
I am disposed to discourse a while vp∣on this point, to giue ansvv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to that you haue demanded. You write that you vnderstand that I am reconciled vvith <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sar,</HI> and with <HI>Appius,</HI> and fur∣ther you adde, that for being so, you doe not reprehend me; but that you would know what reason hath moued me to defend &amp; praise <HI>Vatinius</HI>: which, that it may the better be explained, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is necessarie, that I declare my minde vnto you; taking my discourse from far-fetch'd passages. When I returned, good <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntulus,</HI> into my Countrie, it was my meaning to helpe, not onely my friends, but also the Common-wealth; and because I found my selfe infinitely oblieged vnto you, as being by your meanes returned; I thought I was likewise oblieged vnto it, as ha∣uing fauoured you in my restauration. And whereas formerly I had wearied my selfe in the seruice thereof, because I would not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wanting vnto it in the office of a good Cittizen; I now thinke that it behooueth me much more to doe the same, that I might not be vn∣gratefull. And this disposition of mine I made knowne vnto the Senate, when you were Consull; and reasoned with your selfe often about it. Though from the beginning, when you sought that the Senate should restore my former losses, many things offended me; find∣ing
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elfe of the one part secretly hated, and of the other slowly fauou∣red. For, neither when there was rea∣soning about my house, or of that wic∣ked violence, by which I, and my bro∣ther were cast out of doores; did they ioyne with you, which should haue as∣sisted: nor yet made they demonstra∣tion of that minde towards me, which I expected; not only in matters that were of moment, no nor yet in such, as although they were for the great los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of all my moueables neces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arie: howsoeuer they were of mee, but as base things, little esteemed. And though I perceiued t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings passe in this manner, (for they were not very se∣cret,) yet did I not esteeme the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iurie, equall vnto their merit past. Wherefore, although I knew my selfe much obliged to <HI>Pompeius</HI>; especially because you more then any man tolde mee, that you saw him very earnest in my cause; And although I loued him, not so much for hauing receiued curte∣sies from him, as because I haue beene alwayes inclined to affect him; think∣ing that he for his vertue had deserued it: yet without hauing any regard to what he desired, I followed my old cu∣stome, hauing in euery action, the good of the Common-wealth my sole ob∣iect. And in token of the truth, <HI>Pompeius</HI> being of the Senate, when he went in∣to
<PB N="31" REF="29"/>
<HI>Rome,</HI> to commend <HI>Publius Sextius</HI>; and <HI>Vatinius</HI> one of the testimonies, had tolde, that I was become one of <HI>Caesars</HI> friends, moued thereunto by his happy fortune; I gaue him this answer. That the fortune of <HI>Bibulus,</HI> which hee esteemed full of misery, was greater in my estimation, then all the triumphs, and victories. And in another place, I said (euen in the presence of <HI>Pompeius,</HI>) that none but they thrust mee out of <HI>Rome,</HI> which where occasion that <HI>Bibu∣lus</HI> feared to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur out of doores. And that examination of mine was onely to reprehend the Tribuneship of <HI>Vati∣nius.</HI> Where I spake with great liberty and courage, about violence, authority, and the donation of Kingdomes. Nei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther did I in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ny other times speake in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with the same constancie. And further, <HI>Mar∣celinus,</HI> and <HI>Philippus</HI> being Consuls, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Senate vpon the fift of Aprill, was con∣tented vpon my request, that on the fifteenth of May in open Senate, the case should bee proposed of the <HI>Campan</HI> Territorie. Thinke you that I could at this time couragiously handle this cause rather, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orget my owne cala∣mities, and call to remembrance my owne actions? When I had spoken my opinion, there grew great alteration, in some particular persons, which had oc∣casion; and in others also, which I
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
could neuer haue imagined. For the decree being made, after that manner that I had councelled; <HI>Pompeius,</HI> with∣out making any demonstration vnto me, that he was displeased; tooke his iourney for <HI>Sardinia,</HI> and <HI>Africa:</HI> and went by <HI>Luca</HI> to meet with <HI>Caesar</HI>; who complained much of this deed of mine: as being incensed a little before in <HI>Ra∣uenna,</HI> by <HI>Crassus,</HI> who had spoken much ill vnto him concerning mee: And, though I had vnderstood by many, that <HI>Pompeius</HI> was offended with mee; Yet my brother gaue mee the greatest no∣tice, who meeting him in <HI>Sardinia,</HI> a little while after hee came from <HI>Luca,</HI> was thus saluted by him. In very deed, Sir, I desired to see no man rather then you: neither could fortune haue brought mee any man, with whom I could bee so much contented. If you take not such order, that your brother <HI>Marcus</HI> keepe the promise that you on his behalfe made vs, this debt will fall vpon you. What needs more vvords? He complained grieuously; hee made repetition of his deserts; hee called to memory the agreement made about the acts of <HI>Caesar</HI>; and follovved on yet further, that he knevv vvell, that <HI>Caesar</HI> lou'd my happinesse; p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying him at last, to recommend vnto me the cause, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he honour of the aforesayd [<HI>Cae∣sar.</HI>] And that at the least, I should not
<PB N="33" REF="30"/>
oppugne him, if I vvould not, or could not help him. When I had from my brother vnderstood these things, and <HI>Vibullius,</HI> by commission of <HI>Pompeius,</HI> hauing beene a little before to speake vvith mee, that I should in courtesie leaue, till his returne, the <HI>Campan</HI> cause, in the state it vvas in: driuen to bethinke me of my selfe, I turned me vvholly to consider mine ovvne affaires, becom∣ming after a sort petitioner to the Common-vvealth: That in conside∣ration of so much paines, as I had taken for it, it vvould be pleased to grant me, that I might shevv my selfe gratefull to∣vvards my benefactours, and continue the trust of my brother; and that it vvould suffer that man to bee good, vvhom in all occasions it had found to be a good Citizen. Novv in all my a∣ctions and sentences, vvhich seeme to offend <HI>Pompeius,</HI> I perceiued, that there vvere certaine persons vvhom you may imagine, vvhich, notvvithstanding they vvere of my opinion, and had alvvaies beene so, yet they reioyced, that I fol∣lovved not the vvill of <HI>Pompeius</HI>; hoping assuredly, that he, for that cause should grovv a cold friend vnto me, and <HI>Caesar</HI> a capitall enemie. I had iust occasion to be grieued hereat; but much more, that in my pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sence, they did most fa∣miliarly embrace, vvelcome, and kisse mine enemie. But vvhy doe I say, mine
<PB N="34" REF="31"/>
enemie? rather enemie of the Lavv, of the Courts of Iustice, of the quiet of his Countrey, and in conclusion, of all men of honesty. vvith that demonstra∣tion, they had an opinion they should mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mee to anger, but it vvas not so; because in mee all anger vvas ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngui∣shed. These passages therefore conside∣red, and making a calculation, vvith that vnderstanding that God had giuen mee, I reduced into forme all my dis∣courses: vvhich if I be able, I vvil briefly recount vnto you. If I should see the Common-vvealth to bee gouerned by vvicked &amp; loose Citizens, as vve knovv falleth out in our times; and haue vn∣derstood, to haue at other times also occurred; no force, either of revvards, vvhich I slightly esteeme, nor yet of dangers, vvhich were vvont to feare the stou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est men, could haue such interest in me, that I should consent to the li∣king of men of such condition, al∣though my heart should tell mee, they had obliged mee.

by councell, as by fauour; and vnvvil∣ling to haue other enemy in the Citie, then that man that vvas to me an ene∣my; I thought not, that I should bee held for inconstant, if I had a little al∣tered some of my opinions; inclining my vvill to that, vvhich appertained to the dignity, both of a man of his sort, and of such an one, as vvas my Bene∣factour. And being of this minde, it vvas necessarie for me, as you see, that I should also fauour <HI>Caesar,</HI> hee being in∣vvard vvith <HI>Pompeius</HI>; to vvhich, part∣ly ancient friendship much moued me, that I and my brother <HI>Quintus</HI> haue al∣vvaies, as you knovv, held vvith <HI>Caesar</HI>; partly, the humanity and courtesie, vvhich hee hath many vvayes in short time shevved vs. And to this, the re∣spect of the Common-wealth, made great addition: seeming vnto mee, that it did not onely dislike, but strangely re∣fused, that there should be any conten∣tion with men of that quality. Especial∣ly <HI>Caesar</HI> hauing performed many valo∣rous actions thereunto behoofefull. And I being heretofore entred into such deliberation, was vpon the for∣mer occasions, altogether settled, by reason of the testimonie, that <HI>Pompeius</HI> had giuen of me to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and my bro∣ther to <HI>Pompeius.</HI> Moreouer, I should haue considered, that which is by our <HI>Plato</HI> written so diuinely; that, <HI>Citi∣zens
<PB N="36" REF="32"/>
were wont to bee such, as their Gouer∣nours.</HI> I remember the first day of my Consulship, and often afterwards, that I might keepe the Common-wealth in a direct course, and at one stay, I layd so strong foundations, and in such a manner encouraged the Senate, that it was no maruell, though it carried it selfe so stoutly in December follow∣ing. And in conclusion, I remembred: that from the time of our Consulship, vntill that of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Bibulus,</HI> men li∣ued in exceeding peace, and vnity; And vpon any occasion wee had to speake in Senate, our opinions had that esteeme that was befitting: after∣wards; at that time when you were Gouernour of the hither <HI>Spaine,</HI> the Common-wealth hauing no Consuls, but Merchants of Prouinces, and ser∣uants, and ministers of seditions; for∣tune would, to giue occasion of war, throw mee into the midst of the Camp of discord, and ciuill contention. In which danger, the Senate hauing rea∣dily raised it selfe, and whole <HI>Italy,</HI> with the strength of the best men, in my de∣fence and assistance: I will not relate what happened; because I should com∣plaine of many; I will onely in briefe say, that I needed no army, but I wan∣ted Commanders; And the fault was in generall of all those, which did not defend mee; but particularly of those,
<PB N="37" REF="32"/>
which were tyed to defend me. And if they should bee reprehended, which were truely fearefull, they which coun∣terfetted feare, are so much more blame-worthy. Certainely, that dispo∣sition of my minde was worthy of commendation; when seeing my Citi∣zens most ready to succour mee, and desirous, to shew me their thankfulnes; yet because they were without Lea∣ders, I would not put them to encoun∣ter with armed seruants. But it sufficed me, onely to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, how much strength should haue beene by consent of good men gathered, if they had had occasiō of a battaile for me, when I was strong, and lusty; seeing they could after∣wards, when I was at the weakest, giue mee succour. Whose mindes you did not onely know, when you took paines about mee, but also you confirmed and maintained [them.] And I will neuer deny; rather, while I breath, I will be mindefull, and report it willingly; that you vsed the means of some most noble personages, which were more strong in restoring me, then they were after in retaining mee. In which intention, if they had perseuered; together with my prosperitie, they had regained th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir owne au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Because, the good Citizens, recouering themselues in your Consulship; and being by your example rouzed from that drowzinesse,
<PB N="38" REF="33"/>
that had long oppressed them; especi∣ally, hauing the protection of <HI>Cneius P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpeius,</HI> and of <HI>Caesar,</HI> who, by his owne strength, was raised by the Se∣nate, to singular and vnusuall honours, no wicked Citizen could haue euer of∣fended the Common-wealth. But marke, I pray you, how things haue proceeded. That infamous fellow <HI>Clo∣dius,</HI> which polluted the womens sacri∣fices; who gaue no more honour to the Goddesse <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> then to his owne three sisters, was absolued of that fault, for which he ought deseruedly to haue suf∣fered. And afterwards, <HI>Milo,</HI> Tribune of the people, and with him many iust men, entreating, that this seditious Ci∣tizen might, according to his fact, bee punished; the Iudges, against all rights of Iustice, did acquit h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, depriuing the Common-wealth of so memorable an example, of reuenge vpon seditions. And afterwards, the very same Iudges permitted, that the name of <HI>Enemy,</HI> was with bloudy letters engrauen, in the house, that was not mine, (because it was no booty of mine, I hauing onely a hand in the building thereof) but did belong vnto the Senate, who payd the charges of it. It is true, that I ought them that thankfulnesse, which was due for so great a ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fit, as bringing me out of banishm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, and giuing mee my health againe. But I would, that

they had not onely, as Physicians, had regard vnto my health, but also of my strength, and colour; according to the custome of those good masters, which take care to anoynt such as are to make proofe of their actiuity. But as <HI>Apelles</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by his curious Art, finished the head of <HI>Venus,</HI> with the vpper part of her breast, leauing the other part of her body, with a meere beginning: so may I say that some men about my head, haue onely laboured, and haue left the rest of the body rude, and vnperfected. And because those that enuie me, and espe∣cially mine enemies, thought, that the blow giuen mee by banishment, had partly taken away my courage, you could not imagine how much I haue deceiued their expectation. Heretofore, of <HI>Quintus Metellus,</HI> son of <HI>Lucius,</HI> who was a stout man, and of a strong heart, and in my iudgement, for greatnesse, and constancie of minde surpassing all men; they reported, that they vnder∣stood, (though I hold it rather to bee a thing of their owne forging,) that hee being returned from banishment, made alwai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s shew of a weake and deiected minde. How is it credible, that hee should be changed by banishment, ha∣uing both by especiall election accep∣ted it, and with great courage of minde sustained it, being carelesse of his re∣turne? and how comes it, that they
<PB N="40" REF="34"/>
take not notice, how <HI>Metellus</HI> in con∣stancie and grauitie exceeded all men; euen that <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cus S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aurus,</HI> who was so famous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the world? But their malice made them beleeue that of mee, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>magined, or vnderstood of him; that is, that I should grow base, or bee deiected: though the Common-wealth gaue me greater encouragement, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n I euer had before, in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owne, that it could not be vvithout mee.

<HI>Caesar,</HI> they doe herein openly repre∣hend me, as if I were become a rebell to my ovvne person, and vnto the af∣fection vvhich I haue formerly carried to my countrie. And they consider not, that I am moued hereunto, not onely by the reasons spoken of in the begin∣ning, but also these last, vvhich I began to manifest.

Which, those chiefe men of ours, doe not onely demonstrate vvith signes externall, from the which they might vvith ease haue absteined, but haue many times in diu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse fashions reuealed it.

For we haue already all these things; the stay of those that are ho∣nest, which are affectionated to him, by reason th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he being Tribune, laboured on my behalfe; the fauour of the peo∣ple, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the magnificence of the shewes, and because they know him of a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee disposition; the attendance of the young men, and those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t are beloued of the people, because they see him al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o beloued, and know how diligent hee is in the like occasions. And there is l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of all the fauour, which I afford him: which, though of it selfe it bee not of that quality, that it can doe much, yet, because it is knowne to be iust, and due, and full of gratefull affection, perad∣uenture for this cause, if not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or any thing else, it will produce some fruit.

For almost all were of opinion, that my Legions, and those of <HI>Bibulu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> should be made vp with <HI>Italian</HI> souldiers. Where∣unto <HI>Sulpicius</HI> the Consull, saying, he would not consent, I much complai∣ned thereof; but the Senate so greatly hastned my departure, that I was for∣ced to obey him, as I did Now I desire, you would carry in mind, what I de∣maunded of you in the letters, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h I deliuered at <HI>Rome</HI> to your posts: which was, that whatsoeuer one could effect, for the ease of a domesticall and louing friend, in visiting the Prouince, you would procure with all affection and diligēce, for the inuiolable loue I beare you: that euery one might plainly dis∣cerne,
<PB N="104" REF="66"/>
that neither I could euer haue succeeded any man, more deuoted to me then you, nor you resigne the Pro∣uince to any, who lou'd you more dear∣ly then I. By those, which you wrote vnto the Senate, whereof you sent me a copie, I vnderstood, that you had ca∣sheer'd a great number of souldiers: but the aboue mentioned <HI>Fabius</HI> certi∣fied me, that you had indeed such a de∣termination, but at his departure, it was not yet effected. If it be so, you shall doe me a singular kindnes, not to wea∣k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n so small an armie.

Whatsoe∣uer one friend can doe for another, I will not leaue vndone for your sake; not onely because I euer honored you, from the first day you began to loue me: but further, in that I infinitely e∣steeme two persons, of two seuerall a∣ges, <HI>Cnei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Pompeius</HI> your daughters fa∣ther in law, and <HI>Marcus Brutus</HI> your sonne in law.

<P>I Came to <HI>Trallis</HI> on the xxvii. of Iuly. There <HI>Lucius Lucilius</HI> presented me your letters, and related what by word of mouth you did commit vnto him. You could not haue sent me a man that was more my friend, neither as I thinke more wise and discreete, to informe me of such matters, as I desired to vnder∣stand. I haue read your letters with great satisfaction, and gaue a diligent eare to <HI>Lucilius</HI>: Now, you being of o∣pinion also, that ceremonies should not passe betwixt vs, (for, you write: though you haue read, with much con∣tentment what so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uer by me was men∣tioned about mutuall kind offices, dis¦charged one to another; yet because I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etch't my r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation of them somewhat too farre about; you thought them not altogether so requisite) and because in∣deed

they are meerely supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fluous, when the amitie is such, as hath beene long tried, and that there is no further doubt of faithfulnesse; I will lay them aside: thanking you onely, as I haue reason, for the louing diligence, you vse, in reforming the state of the Pro∣uince, to facilitate my gouernment of the same. First therefore, I thanke you for so courteous an office, then I en∣gage my faithfull promise vnto you, that with all endeuour and zeale, I will euer labour, that first your selfe, and all your friends, and others a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terwards may also perceiue, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a friend I am vnto you. And of thus much, whoso∣euer he be, that's ignorant, he rather seemes, to be discontented at our friendship, then not to be priuie to it. But certainely, it shall apparently bee knowne. For it shall be made manifest by no obscure, nor ignoble persons; neither in occasions lightly importing: but let the effects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather proue this, then my words. And in that you write, that going the same way I entend, you feare, you shall not see me in the Pro∣uince, I will reueale the whole matter to you.

<PB N="108" REF="68"/>
and therefore you would be glad, that I were arriued at <HI>Sida,</HI> a maritime part of the Prouince: I told him I would: and so had done, but that <HI>Lucius Clodius</HI> aduis'd me in <HI>Corcyra</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to enter into this encombrance, because at my arri∣uall, you would be in <HI>Laodicea.</HI> This was a farre shorter cut, and more com∣modious; principally in that it gaue you better satisfaction: but afterwards you altered your resolution. Now, you shall vnderstand my disseigne, to the end that you may gather, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you may easily, if there be any way for our meeting. I thinke to be at <HI>Laodicea,</HI> on the last of Iulie: and there will I continue for cer∣taine dayes, for the receipt of some mo∣nies, which I made ouer by way of ex∣change from <HI>Rome.</HI> Then will I take my course towards the armie; so that in the middest of September, I make ac∣compt to be at <HI>Iconium.</HI> But if I mistake my selfe in writing, (for I know not what may happen) whensoeuer I set forwards you shall be aduertised of my iournies from day to day, with all pos∣sible expedition, and diligence. I nei∣ther dare, nor willingly will impose vpon you any burden, but if it may be with your conueniencie, it greatly im∣ports vs both, that we should meete, before you leaue the Prouince. If any euill hap, preuent this our interuiew, yet notwithstanding in the gouernment

of this Prouince, I will haue no lesse care of your honour, and reputation, then if I had seene you. I will not write vnto you, that you should performe any thing on my behalfe, till I be out of hope, of meeting you.

<PB N="110" REF="69"/>
aske of him, by what pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he thought you would haue me make entrance in∣to the Prouince: He answering me, that I could not please you better, then to goe by shipping to <HI>Sida.</HI> I promis'd to doe so; though I did it with great dis∣commoditie, and little credit. But af∣terwards meeting in <HI>Corcyra, Lucius Clo∣dius,</HI> a man so possest of your heart, that talking with him, me thought I spake with your selfe, I said to him, that I meant to take the same course, <HI>Phania</HI> prescribed me: then he giuing me thankes, for the entire af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection I shew∣ed herein, importun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d me, to goe di∣rectly to <HI>Laodicea</HI>; affirming, that you would reside in the edge, or skirt of the Prouince, for your more readie depar∣ture: and, but that I was Successor, whom you so much desired to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, you would haue beene gone before your Successors comming. Which fitly con∣fronted with the letters, that I rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iued in <HI>Rome</HI>: by which I perceiued what hast you made to depart. I answered <HI>Clodius,</HI> that I was readie to doe as he counselled me, and farre more willing∣ly, then to performe my promise vnto <HI>Phania.</HI> So that hereupon changing my determination, I presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly wrote a let∣ter vnto you, with mine owne hand, which was deliuered timely enough, as your an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>were thereunto implies. In do∣ing this, I haue, as I suppose, discharg'd
<PB N="111" REF="69"/>
my part, neither could I shew any grea∣ter kindnesse. Now with this, compare what you haue done. You did not one∣ly not come thither, where you might with the soonest haue had sight of me. but you remooued into those parts, where I could not possibly arriue, with∣in the terme of those thirty daies, which were assigned you, for your departure, as I suppose, by the law <HI>Cornelia.</HI> So that it seemed vnto them, who were not ac∣quainted with our mutuall affections, that you seeke to auoid our meeting; and consequently (to say no worse) that you were but a cold friend vnto me: but on the other side, they iudge, me most louing to you. And in deed, before I came into the Prouince I re∣ceiued your letters, in which, though you certified me, of your going to <HI>Tar∣sus,</HI> neuerthelesse you gaue me assured hope of our meeting. Yet some persons afterwards, and as I beleeue, malicious (for many at this day are possest with that vice) hauing fit matter to talke of, and being no waies acquainted with the stabilitie of my mind, laboured to alienate me from your friendship, al∣ledging vnto me, that you had some in∣terest in <HI>Tarsus,</HI> that you establish't, and perform'd many things; whereas, you might haue considered, that when I was entred into the Prouince, it belon∣ged not to you, further to gouerne it.
<PB N="112" REF="70"/>
Which neither they were euer wont to doe, that within a short time expected the arriuall of their Successor. But these mens wordes neuer troubled me; ra∣ther, being true, I was beholding to you, for you eased me herein, of a part of my burthen; and I reioyced, that whereas the imployment of my gouernment was to continue for a whole yeare, which I thought ouer-long, I was by your means eased, of a moneths labour and trauaile. One thing, (to speake truth) displeaseth me, that, of those few souldiers, which remain'd in the Pro∣uince, there wanted no lesse then three Cohorts, which were more entire then the rest; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I cannot learne how they are disposed of. But aboue all it grieues me, that I cannot certainly vn∣derstand, where to see you: and I de∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd writing, for no other cause, but by reason, I hourely expected your pre∣sence. But becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you wrote nothing to me, I haue sent vnto you, <HI>Antonius,</HI> Conductor of the new Supplies, a vali∣ant man, and one in whom, I pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great confidence; that, if you thinke good, you may assigne to him the charge of the <HI>Infan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery</HI>: that I may attempt some enterprise, while the season of the yeare serues. Wherein, both our amitie, and your letters, put me in hope that I should not want, your best directions, neither do I yet despaire of those hopes.
<PB N="113" REF="70"/>
But questionlesse, when, or where I may see you, except you certifie me by writing, I cannot so much as imagine. For that which belongs to me; both good, and bad shall apparently see, that my mind is as friendly addicted to loue you, as possiblie it can be. For yours, you haue giuen ill disposed men some occasion to surmise the contrary; doe but reclaime this errour, and I will hold you most deare vnto me. And because you might consider, or cast where we may meete, without the breach of the <HI>Cornelian</HI> law; I arriued in my Prouince on the last of Iuly: I goe into <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icia,</HI> by way of <HI>Cappad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ia.</HI> I remooued the Campe from <HI>Iconium,</HI> the last of Au∣gust.

In the same epistle you intreated me, forthwith to giue them licēce to build, before the winter came vpō them: &amp; withal, chec∣king me couertly, you cōplained that I prohibited them, to collect the tribute: before my selfe, made acquainted with the matter, had giuen licence; you af∣firming that this was but a kind of cros∣sing their courses; in that I could not informe me of this matter before the winter, after my returne out of <HI>Cilicia</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Now, conceiue rightly, whether you haue any cause to complaine of me. Di∣uers parties came crying out, and say∣ing, They were grieuously exacted vp∣on, through the paying of intollerable tributes. I wrote, that nothing should be done therein, before I had well ex∣amin'd the matter: can any man say this was iniustice? Oh, but you'le tell me I could not be inform'd thereof before the winter: I grant it: but should I goe seeke my informations from them, or they come to me? What you'le say, so farre off? When you wrot vnto me that I should permit them to build before Winter: suppos'd you not that they were to come where I was? though in
<PB N="115" REF="71"/>
deed, they committed an absurditie, worthie of derision. For, they sent me the letters when winter was almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ded, importing a suit, that they might finish their worke in the Sommer that was past: but know, howsoeuer, I am readie to obserue your pleasure; al∣though, they are far more in number, that refuse to pay such tributes, then those, that are therewith contented. Concerning the <HI>Appians</HI> this may suf∣fice. <HI>Pausania, Lentulus</HI> free-man, and an officer of mine, tels me, that to him you seem'd offended, that I met you not. Did I this, thinke you, out of any disesteeme of you, and because I am the proudest man in the world? A man of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, came after midnight, and infor∣med me, that you would be at <HI>Iconium</HI> before daie. When, being two seuerall waies, and not knowing by which you might haue come, I sent <HI>Varro,</HI> a fami∣liar acquaintance of yours, one way, and <HI>Quintus Lepta,</HI> chiefe of the inge∣niers of mine armie another: enioyning both of them, to come post before, that I might goe out to meere you: <HI>Lepta</HI> came running and told me, how you were gone beyond the armie: I came presently to <HI>Iconium.</HI> How the matter went afterwards you know: why should not I come and meete you? First being <HI>Appius Claudius,</HI> then being <HI>Appius</HI> Im∣perator. Moreouer, it being the cu∣stome

of our predecessors? and, which is of greater importance, you being my friend? especially, I hauing euer beene, more obseruant in such offices, then e∣uer stood with mine honour and condi∣tion. But no more of this. The same <HI>Pausanius</HI> told me further; how you complained of me in these words: did <HI>Appius</HI> meete <HI>Lentulus,</HI> did <HI>Lentulus</HI> the like to <HI>Appius,</HI> and would not <HI>Cicero</HI> vouchsafe, to come and meete <HI>Appius</HI>? How comes it to passe? that you being a man, in my iudgement, of singular learning, and wisedome, greatly expe∣rienced in worldly affaires; and fur∣ther, endewed with a pleasing affabili∣tie; which is a vertue, as the <HI>Stoicks</HI> de∣seruedly hold opinion; I say, how can it be then, that you should be carried a∣way with these fopperies, supposing that either <HI>Appius,</HI> or <HI>Lentulus</HI> for their nobilitie, should be highlier esteemed of me, then the ornaments of vertue? Though I had not past those honours, which in vulgar esteeme, are glorious, yet could not I admire these your names: I rather valued those men high∣ly, which left them vnto you. But after I was with much honour, elected to many offices of gouernments of great qualitie, wherein I bare my selfe so ap∣prouedly, that I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not wish greater reputation, or glory [then was giuen me]; I neuer reputed my selfe your

Nor could I see, that euer <HI>Cneius Pom∣peius,</HI> whom I prefer before all others, or <HI>Publius Lentulus,</HI> to whom I giue place, retain'd any other opinion.

Then, I cast many things in my minde: First, I could not bee perswaded that you, who are not onely wise, but as the report now goes, a noble minded man, should be delighted in these Em∣bassies: and as I remember once in <HI>Synnadis,</HI> vpon the publique Tribunall I spake much thereof; alledging in the first place, how <HI>Appius Clodius,</HI> with∣out further testimonie from the <HI>Myn∣densians</HI> (for that City was then men∣tioned) was knowne by the Senate, and by the people of <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>: and more∣ouer, that I had obseru'd at other times, that the Legates that came to praise any man, neuer obtain'd au∣dience of the Senate. And finally I concluded, that their good enclination lik't me wel, because they shewed them∣selues thankfull to you, who had bene fitt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them; but that I thought this
<PB N="120" REF="74"/>
course no wayes necessarie: and if needes they would demonstrate their good affection, I should haue thought well of it, if some one had done it of his owne charge: And haue granted it; so that the expence had beene reasona∣ble; but not, if exorbitant. You can∣not therefore in any reason, take this ill at my hands: except, (as you adde) that mine edict had beene past, vpon pur∣pose, to crosse these legations; as some were of opinion. Now, in my iudge∣ment, they beare not themselues so ill, who doe such bad offices, as they, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd an eare vnto them. While I was yet in <HI>Rome</HI> I drew the edict; after∣wards, I annexed thereunto but one clause, which I tooke out of yours: and this at the importunity of the Tole-masters, who came to <HI>Samos</HI> to me, for this purpose; and touching the disburthening of the Cities of their charge, I wrote that article with speci∣all care<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and I annexed thereunto some new conditions, which gaue me good satisfaction; being so beneficiall to the Cities, as if I had herein restored to them their liues. But this poynt, which occasion'd all the suspition, that I went about to wrong you; is an ordinarie thing, put in practice by others before my selfe. And I could not be so foolish to imagine, that the Embassadours came to <HI>Rome</HI> for any priuate occasion;
<PB N="121" REF="74"/>
as being sent, not to giue thankes to a priuate man, but vnto you; not for particular interests, but publique; and in an assembly not priuate, but generall to the world, that is, in the open Se∣nate. Neither when I interposed this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y command; that no man should de∣part without my license, did I exclude them, which could not come to me be∣yond Mount <HI>Tauru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> where I was with the Armie. And that clause in your letters well deserues laughter. For, see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing they might haue spoken to me, as I went betwixt <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dicea,</HI> and <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onium</HI>; as the Magistrates and Ambassadours of all those Precincts, and Cities did, Which dwell on this side <HI>Taurus</HI>; to what purpose was it, that they should come and speake with me in the camp; or that they should passe the Mount <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rus:</HI> except they had not resolued of their Embassies to <HI>Rome,</HI> before my being beyond <HI>Taurus.</HI> Which questi∣onlesse is not so. For while I was in <HI>Laodicea, Apamea, Synn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dis, Philomel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> and <HI>Ieonium,</HI> in which Cities I stayd, all these Embassies were constituted. And yet you must conceiue thus much, that about the diminu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, or absolute ta∣king away of the charge, for these Le∣gations, I referred my selfe wholly to their pleasure, that were of highest au∣thoritie in the Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies. In that it might iustly be feared, that by reason of vn∣necessarie
<PB N="122" REF="75"/>
disbursements, things might haue beene brought to that passe, that it had beene needfull to sell the tributes, and to haue layd an imposition, of so much by the powle, or by the house; which, as you know, would haue beene a very hard matter. And I being ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣full (not onely iustice, but compassion mouing me thereto) to ease the burthe∣ned state of those affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted Cities, and especially oppressed by their owne Ma∣gistrates, I could not well be negligent, in the case of so impertinent an ex∣pence. When such tales therefore were told you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you should not haue beleeued them. But if you take pleasure to lay your owne iealousies vpon others, you bring vp in friendship, a certaine dis∣course little beseeming a Gentle-man. And if I meant in any thing, to haue blemished your reputation, I would ne∣uer haue beene inquisitiue of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our son in law <HI>Lentulus,</HI> of your free-man in <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndusi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> nor of the cheefe Engine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>Coreyra,</HI> whither you would haue me to come.

Thus much I will freely vtter; if these things, which you say, were rela∣ted to you by others; bee your owne dreames, or fictions; you commit a greeuous errour: but being true, that they were the reports of others, yet, you are greatly too blame, to giue eare vnto them. I will neuer faile in the office of a good freind. And if any man thinke, I haue some subtill reach in my procee∣dings; whosoeuer he be, I would hee would tell me, what a wonderfull sub∣tilty I should shew in this; that I, when I was in <HI>Rome,</HI> and your selfe in your Prouince, euer defended your reputati∣on, when I could not so much as dream, I should need your ayd in these occurrents; should now, when you are in <HI>Rome,</HI> and I in my Prouince, giue you cause, to neglect my credit? But it may bee, you suppose that I haue done you iniury, in my giuing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are to certaine persons, that dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>au'd, or spake ill of your Legates, or Cape-Ingeniers, or Tribunes of the souldiers: wherein, notwithstanding, I neuer heard, that they touched your reputation; or that they should speake vnworthily of any

other, but the fore-mentioned, of which men, <HI>Clodius</HI> discoursing with me in <HI>Corcyra,</HI> complained greatly, and said, that other mens malignitie, had blemisht the integritie of your name. I neuer drew any man to speech of such like matters: but by reason, they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e many that talke thereof, no wayes in my iudgement, wronging therein your honour, I would not be too for∣ward, to put them to silence. If any one hold opinion, that no man can be really reconciled: hee accuseth not vs herein, as men perfidious, but rather manifests his owne treacherie, disco∣uering that to be in himselfe, which he imputes to others: and such an one, hath no better conceipt of you, then of mee: But if the forme of my gouern∣ment distastes any man, thinking it strange, that in the gouernment of this Proui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, I take some courses different from yours: each of vs obseruing Iu∣stice and equitie, though you one way, and I another; I doe not greatly value such a mans good opinion. You, as a most noble &amp; bountifull Gentle-man, gaue profusely in the Prouince, if I haue proceeded with a more restrained hand, &amp; that the yeere following hath cut off a part of your former bounties; by reason of the hardnes of the times, no man need wonder hereat: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, be∣sides that of mine owne nature, I was

euer sparing of anothers purse, I was much mou'd (as I told you) out of the conditions of the time: and therefore little care, to seeme niggardly to those, that complaine vpon their peculiar in∣terests, so I bee herein good vnto my selfe. Touching the aduertisements you send mee, concerning <HI>Romane</HI> af∣faires, I heartily thanke you, and the rather, because you intimate, that you will be carefull of those businesses, that I commended to you; in which, of one aboue the rest, I request you to bee mindefull, that the time of my gouern∣ment be not prolonged; And entreat <HI>Hortens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> our Colleague and famili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r friend, that if euer he did, or intended to doe me a pleasure, hee will not now perseuer in his opinion of the gouern∣ment for two yeeres: for nothing can more molest, or discontent me.

<P>WIth much a doe, I haue at last read a letter, well beseeming <HI>Appius Clodius,</HI> full of humanity, cour∣tesie, and friendly care. Out of questi∣on, the very sight of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me,</HI> hath retur∣ned you your former sweet procee∣ding. For when you wrote vnto me on the way, while you were yet in <HI>Asia,</HI> about the matter of the Legates, whose comming to <HI>Rome</HI> I prohibited: and when you complain'd, that I hindred the <HI>Appian</HI> edifications, it gaue mee no small distaste; &amp; mine own conscience witnessing, that I had beene euer con∣stant in louing you, I returned an an∣swer halfe in choller: yet after I read the letters deliuered to <HI>Philotimus</HI> my Free-man, I perceiued, there were ma∣ny in the Prouince, which affected our falling out. But after you came to <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="77"/>
or at least, as soone as you had seene your friends, you vnderstood of them my perpetuall loue and affection to∣wards you, manifesting it selfe, vpon all occurrents, while you stay'd in your Prouince: wherefore imagine, how neere my heart those words went, you wrote vnto me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> If any thing fall out for my aduancement and dignity, though it be vnpossible, yet render me equall kindnesse. This, you may easi∣ly doe; for, what is there in this world, which endeauour will not compasse? Neither can any attempt be so difficult, but a true affection may ouercome it. I euer thought, &amp; so my friends write, that you should obtaine a <HI>Triumph,</HI> but yet I am exceedingly satisfied in the cer∣tainty you giue me thereof; and not bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use I hope my selfe as easily to get it; (for this were but an <HI>Epicurean</HI> part) but in that your honour and dignity is of it selfe most deere vnto me. Seeing therefore, you haue greater conueni∣encie of messengers, then any other; for none would come hither, without giuing you notice; when my suit hath gotten that successe, which you expect, and I desire, I should bee very glad, to be therof aduertised. If through those long Sessions of the Senate, as our friend <HI>Pompeius</HI> was wont to terme them, you are delayed a day or two, (for there is no likely-hood it shall bee
<PB N="128" REF="78"/>
longer,) your dignity will no wayes be impeach't by this deferring. But for the loue you beare mee, and for that, that you expect from mee. Vouchsafe to cheere me vp, with this acceptable in∣formation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emember to keep pro∣mise with me about the present, which you promised to make mee. For be∣sides, that I am desirous of the Science of Auguration; any gifts of yours in∣finitely please me, they being an appa∣rant testimony of the loue you beare me. And because you demand some e∣quall remuneration, I must ruminate well vpon it, that I may make you the like requitall: For, if I should not take the paines in this, that vsually I doe in my other compositions, which you are wont to thinke worthy of admiration. You might haue iust cause, to repute me not onely negligent, but vnthankfull. And of these matters enough. Further now, my desire is, that you bring to ef∣fect the offer which you made me; my meaning is, that you labor by all means possible, to compasse me my suites; v∣sing therein your wonted diligence, that the Senate may pleasure mee, and out of hand, with the honourablest demonstrations that may be. You pro∣mis'd it me; see you doe not faile: and doe it likewise, for the sake of our an∣cient am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tie. I doubt, I haue ouer-long deferred my writing thereof to the Se∣nate,
<PB N="129" REF="78"/>
and that my letters<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> through diffi∣cult passage by sea, came in time of the vacations. But herein I followed your example; and I thinke I did well, in not writing so suddenly after my being cal∣led <HI>Imperator,</HI> but after the end of ma∣ny enterprizes, brought to passe in all this summer. Be therefore carefull of this, according to your promise; and so in all other occasions, vouchsafe to take my affaires, my selfe, and all mine, into your friendly protection. Farewell.</P>

<P>VVHen I heard of their presum∣ptuous boldnesse, that mole∣sted you, though at the first hearing I was astonished; becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing could haue hapned further beyond my expe∣ctation; yet when I more aduisedly considered thereof, I tooke heart at grasse, putting great hope in your selfe, but greatest in your friends. And many reasons perswaded me to think, that this trouble would rather augment, then ex∣tenuate your honor. It vext me much, that enuious men had found out a meanes, to depriue you of the glory of your Triumph, which questionlesse
<PB N="130" REF="79"/>
you should haue obtained, conforma∣ble to your deserts. Of which losse, if you make the same reckoning, that I e∣uer esteemed should be made; you shall do wisely, &amp; triumph at last in the sor∣row of your enemies. For I know you to be so strong in friends, and so prudent, that vndoubtedly it will greatly grieue them, that euer they run into such a le∣uity. For mine own part, I assure &amp; pro∣mise you, calling all the gods to wit∣nesse of my heart, that for your digni∣tie, (for so I will rather terme i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, then safetie) in this Prouince, which you gouerned, I will haue more then ordi∣narie care; entreating for you affectio∣nately; endeauouring my selfe no o∣therwise then if you were my kinsman; vsing what authoritie, and power one may haue, that is deare, as I hope to be vnto the Cities, and hath the title of Imperator.

discern'd it by some other way, as no doubt but you shall. But seeing such an occasion is offered, if euer I faile in any thing, let me be reputed a dishonoura∣ble, and very bad man. <HI>Pontinius</HI> whom I know to be much bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd vn∣to you, returnes you those offices that hee owes you.

But if you obtaine to bee Censor, and discharge the Censorship, as you ought, and can: I plainely dis∣cerne, that you will not be a perpetuall and firme defence to your selfe only, but to all your well willers also.

also because by this I see, there is some esteeme made in our Cittie of valour and worth: which reward I alwaies receiued, in paiment of my trauell and paines. But me thought it verie strange, this young man should bee so rash and headstrong, to incurre your enmitie, without all regard of me; whom with singular endeauour, I defended twice in capitall causes: especiallie you being back't with manie qualities, and assi∣stances, that to himselfe are wanting, for I'le speake no worse of him: and these words that slipt from him like a childe, and a foole as hee was; were first certified me in writing by my friend <HI>Marcus Coelius,</HI> and of the same, you haue also written to mee at large.

this, if I had profest open hatred to you? And againe, in case I meant closelie to malice you, I could haue vndertaken no action, would more haue laid me open then this. Were I as persidious, as they that report this of me, I had not beene so palpably foolish, to breake out suddainly with you into so great enmitie; especiallie in a mat∣ter, wherein I might well discouer my desire, but that in effect I could no waies offend you. I remember diuers came and told me, that the rated charge of Embassies, farre exceeded the vsuall proportion; whom I did not enioyne to any thing, but onely said, I thought it fit, that the charge thereof, should mount no higher then was de∣termin'd by the law <HI>Cornelia:</HI> And in this likewise, I referred my selfe to their pleasure; as the accompts of the Citie can testifie: by which it appeares, that the charge was such, as themselues thought good to be at; but, bad men haue striuen to peruert truth with a thousand lies; giuing you to vnder∣stand, that prouisions were not onely taken from those Embassadors, who were going to <HI>Rome,</HI> but were rede∣manded, and caus'd to be restor'd by their Agents, who were alreadie de∣parted, and that this was the cause that many forbare comming to <HI>Rome.</HI> I could finde in my heart to bee verie

plaine with you, were it not, (as before I told you) that my meaning is, as rea∣son requires; onely to iustifie my selfe, and not accuse you; no waies to ag∣grauate your minde, which is alreadie sufficiently disturbed. So that I con∣demne you not for beleeuing these mens words: but 'Ile not spare to set downe some reasons, why you should not haue beleeued them. And certain∣ly, if you repute me an honest man, and for a man worthie of opinion or fame in those Sciences, whereunto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom my childhood I haue beene addicted; if you suppose in mee any generosity of minde: or if you value me of any iudge∣ment in matters of waightie conse∣quence; I cannot perceiue, how it should enter into your minde, that I would practise, (I will not say) any trecherie, any decei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or dissimulation in our friendship; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so much as the least base, or dishonourable part.

But touching the triall <HI>de Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state,</HI> you write two things, which giue me singular con∣tentment; one is, that you were defen∣ded by the Common-wealth her selfe, who, though she were better stor'd with good and valiant cittizens, should support men of your qualitie: but now more especially, because there is such a penurie, in euery age and degree, that shee being left as a poore forsaken, and desolate widdow, hath great reason to imbrace such tutors. the other is: be∣cause you so highly extoll the fidelitie and loue, of <HI>Pompeius,</HI> and <HI>Brutus,</HI> both my very deare friends.

draft you sent me, of the present times, and the whole state of the Common-wealth, and I am much comforted in the prudent discour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you make there of. Because I see the daung<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r is not so great, as I feared, and there is better de∣fence, then I in any wise hoped; If it be true you write vnto me, that all the citty referres it selfe to <HI>Pompeies</HI> direction and gouernment.

<HI>Rome,</HI> you would be glad to confer with me about both our offices. Oh <HI>Seruius,</HI> I would to God we could but haue spo∣ken together, before the ruines of the Common-wealth: (for we may now truely say, she is ruined,) out of question we might haue deuised some way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣hold her. For I know that both in, and after your Consulship, you affected no∣thing but peace. Foreseeing the euill that was to ensue. And though I com∣mended your iudgement, and was of the same opinion my selfe; yet could I neuer procure the atonement of ciuill dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> For I came late; I was a∣lone; and, as it seemed, but weakely in∣formed of the cause. And finally, I found my forces vnable to alter their stubborne min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, that desired warre. Now, seeing we are out of hope to assist the Common-wealth, if we may take some course for the safetie of our owne liues, not to maintaine any forme of our auncient state, but to mourne for the Common-wealth, so far as any wayes may stand with our reputation, I would rather consult with you then any other person in the world whatsoeuer. For I know you rich in the treasure of all learning, and deepely read in all aunci∣ent, and moderne histories. And know, that I had formerly written to you, that your going into the Senate, or rather, into the assembly of Senators, would

To whom, when he intreated me, that I would re∣turne into the Senate, I answered: that I would say as you said, about the peace, or our going into <HI>Spaine.</HI> You see on what termes we stand: our Empire is diuided: warre is kindled in euerie quarter: <HI>Rome</HI> is abandoned, and ex∣pos'd to combustion: the lawes, iudge∣ment, and finally all good customes are supprest. Whereupon, so farre I am from hoping after better, that I know not what I may presume to desire. But if it seeme good to your wisedome, that we consult together, though I resolu'd to remoue further off from <HI>Rome,</HI> then now I am, whose very name I cannot heare spoken without extreme griefe: yet I will come nearer hand. I haue bidden <HI>Trebatius,</HI> that, if at any time, you would send him to speake to me, he refuse not this endeuour: the which I pray doe: or else, you may if you please send some one of your owne people, whom you most t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust: that it may nei∣ther be necessarie for you, to come out of <HI>Rome,</HI> nor for me to approach it.

<P>I Daily heare, that you are pensiue; and that, for the publick s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipwracke, you mourne extreamely. Whereat though I cannot wonder, but confesse, that I likewise, vndergoe the same af∣fliction: neuerthelesse, I both grieue beyond measure, that you being a man endowed with such singular wise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome, will not rather reioyce at your owne good, then vexe at another mans hurt. And I, though I graunt not, that any man is mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e grieu'd at heart, then I am, for the lamentable ouerthrow of our Common-wealth: yet now for many reasons I take comfort, especially in calling to minde, that I neuer fail'd to pay vnto my countrie, whatsoeuer was due from a good Cittizen.

Besides I was in <HI>Rome,</HI> at the beginning of your Consulship, when a discourse falling out, vpon all the ciuill warres, you admonished the Senate, to take heed, by the calamities that were past: and to thinke how much more intollerable those would be, which oppressed the Country in these time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, seeing they had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne so cruell, who oppressed it heretofore, hauing thereof no former president or exam∣ple: In that men, doe vsu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly thinke, that they may in all reason doe, what they haue example for; nay, and to doe wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, then their presid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt allowes.

not without good ground. The lesse familiar I am with him, the more dili∣gently I diue into his disposition. And therefore be secure, that he delaies your restitution for no other reason, but be∣cause hee would haue so much the iu∣ster occasion, to denie their suits with whom hee is displeased.

Whereas you reioyce for my new marriage, I know assured∣ly, that you affect my repose &amp; quiet: but I had neuer taken any new course, in these so lamentable times, but that, at my returne I found mine owne e∣state, in as bad termes as the Com∣mon-wealth: For I was not secure vn∣der mine owne roofe: my whole house was full of entrappings and snares; I found gins laid euery where for me, e∣uen by those, who for my singular be∣nefits, should rather haue had a tender care, of my goods, and safetie.

And when you haue colle∣cted all these things, consider I pray you, whether at your last returne to <HI>Rome,</HI> you requited so many good offi∣ces. Whereas you mention our renu∣ed amity, I know not herein your mea∣ning, because you terme that renued, which neuer was altr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Whereas you write, that I haue done ill, hauing by one onely word, procured your bro∣thers ruine; First, be assured, that I like wondrous well, this your zeale, and good will, accompanied with such vi∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rall loue and affection to your bro∣ther: And then, if in any thing, for the respect of the Common-wealth, I haue beene opposite to your brother; I re∣quest you to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdon me; For, no man can loue the Common-wealth, bet∣ter then my selfe: but if I defended my reputation, from his violent passion towards mee; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may suffice you, that I neuer complained to you, of the iniury hee did m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: who, be∣cause I knew, that he prepared, and di∣sposed the whole power of his Tribune∣ship to my destruction: I besought <HI>Claudia</HI> your wife, and <HI>Mucia</HI> your si∣ster, whose good opinion towards me, I discouered in many things, for the
<PB N="198" REF="113"/>
amities sake betwixt me and <HI>Pompeius,</HI> that they would diuert him from so wicked a determination. But hee, not∣withstanding I had been Consul, &amp; had preserued the Commonwealth, did me such an iniury, as was neuer offred to a∣ny Magistrate, of what mean rank soe∣uer; nor to the worst Citizen. For, at the last of December, as peraduenture you haue heard, he prohibited me, in the re∣signation of my Consulship, to giue ac∣count vnto the people of my procee∣dings: which iniurie notwithstanding, at last redounded to my great honour. For, hee permitting me no further inti∣mation, then mine oath; I swore aloud, and the people with a loud voyce, and to my great glory, swore likewise, that mine oath was most true. Hauing re∣ceiued this grosse disgrace; yet the same day, I sent to <HI>Metellus,</HI> those that were friends to vs both; requesting him to remoue that resolution, he had vndertaken against me; To whom he made answer, That it was not in his power: because, speaking to the peo∣ple, he had formerly implyed, that there was no reason, that he should haue au∣thoritie giuen him to speake, who would not grant the same to others, but had punished them, without permitting them lawfull plea. Oh, what a graue Gentle-man, and braue Citizen was this! who, though I had deliuered the
<PB N="199" REF="113"/>
Senate from death, <HI>Rome</HI> from combu∣stion, and <HI>Italy</HI> from war, thought mee worthy of that punishment, which the Senate, out of the consent of all good men, had inflicted vpon them, who meant to set <HI>Rome</HI> on fire; hew the Ma∣gistrates &amp; Senators in peeces; and to haue rais'd vp, a most bloudy or cruell war. Vpon this, I oppos'd my selfe to your brother, who was present. For, the first of Ianuary, I so buckeld with him in the occasions of the Common-wealth, as hee might perceiue, I wan∣ted neither courage, nor constan∣cie. And afterwards on the third of the same moneth, hee hauing conuocated the people, in the beginning of his O∣ration, he went about to depraue mee, naming, and threatning me euery third word, with full resolution, vtterly to sinke mee; not by way of Iustice, or e∣quitie, but by bitter violence, and passi∣onate outrage. Whose temeritie, if I had not stou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly withstood; who would not haue thought, that in my Consul∣ship, I shewed resolution, rather out of the benefit of my Fortunes, then either for vertue, or fortitude of mind: If you neu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r perceiu'd how ill <HI>Metellus</HI> stood affected to mee; this may bee an eui∣dent signe, that he little esteemes you; neuer writing vnto you, of a matter of so great importāce. But if he did impart his minde vnto you, you sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld thinke
<PB N="200" REF="114"/>
me very milde, and tractable, in that I neuer complain'd therof to you, though I had all the reasons [in the world] to doe it. For, not onely in words, as yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> write, but with all man∣ner of iniuries, he labour'd to persecute me. Now, obserue my humanitie, if it may be termed humanitie, when a man does not onely suppresse the choler of his mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but further humbleth himself, to his enemie. I, though your brother had shamefully iniuried me, yet neuer shew'd my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elfe to him, otherwise then fauorable. And, whensoeuer his name came in question in the Senate; I al∣waies ioyn'd with them in opinion, that proceeded mildly with him. Neither content with this; although hee were mine enemie: yet in that hee was your brother. it did not onely displease mee, but further, I wrought by al my means, and power, that the decree enacted a∣gainst him, might be cancell'd. So, as I oppos'd not your brother; but I haue resisted your brother, neither was I towards you, mutable, as you write; but so constant, that I haue perseuer'd in louing you, though you gaue me oc∣casion to the contrarie. As also at this present, though you write to mee after a threatning manner, yet will I not complaine. Because I doe not onely pardon, but highly commend your passion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> naturall affection intimating
<PB N="201" REF="114"/>
in this, of what force brotherly loue is. But yet I entreat you, that you will also truely waigh my passion; allowing, that if your friends did bitterly, and with cruelty, persecute me without cause; I ought in this case, nor onely, not to giue them place, but make my repai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to you for aid; and make vse of the power, as well of your selfe, as of the whole Armie, vnder you. I euer desir'd to haue you my friend, as likewise, I haue omitted no endeauour, whereby it might appeare, that I was not your friend onely, but your most louing friend. My heart is now, that which it euer was, and so shall continue, so long as you please: and if the hatred that I deferuedly beare to your bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, can any whit extenuate the loue be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wixt vs; I will hereafter forb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are to hate him, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast it be an occasion, that I bee no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beloued.

I haue a wonderfull desire, and except I be deceiued, very commendable; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you would be pleased to celebrate my name, with the publication of your compositions: the which, though ma∣ny times you told me, you would doe; yet I would haue you pardon mee, though I solicite you thereunto: For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orme of your writing, which I euer thought would bee excellent, goes be∣yond my expectation, and hath so won mee, that I am surprized with an excee∣ding desire, that my acts atchieud, may be written with your pen. Because I doe no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> onely hope, that death it selfe shall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtinguish the memoriall of my

And though I know how much you are em∣ployed: neuerthelesse, in that I see, you haue now finished the historie of the <HI>Italian,</HI> and ciuill warre: and you told me you pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected the rest; I would not omit for mine own sake, to admonish you, that you would bethink your selfe, whether you would connex our pro∣ceedings with others; or else to doe, as many <HI>Graecians</HI> haue done, <HI>Calistines</HI> the <HI>Troian</HI> war; <HI>Timaeus</HI> that of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>; and <HI>Polybius</HI> the warre of <HI>Numantia:</HI> all which, diuided the foresaid wars; so you also might separate the ciuill con∣spiracie, from the wars externall. I see not certainely, that it greatly imports my commendation; yet respecting my great desire, surely it imports, that you doe not obserue the order of times, but that you rather anticipate, &amp; first make mention of my actions. And withall, if you employ your wit vpon one sub∣iect onely, and about one person; me thinkes I foresee, how much more co∣pious and more adorned, the discourse wil proue in euery part.

vpon you such a burden (which, in respect of your imployments, you might well refuse:) and then, to impor∣tune you, that you would commend me; in that you may thinke peraduen∣ture I deserue it not. But hauing once begun to exceed the bounds of mode∣stie, wee must absolutely laie aside all bashfulnesse. And therefore I request you earnestly, to set forth mine actions, and that with greater lustre, then per∣aduenture, you iudge to stand with their merit: and that you will not tye your selfe to the lawes of Historie, but to the desert of our friendship: which, I desire, should preuaile further with you in this; then truth. And because heretofore, you wrote, in a certaine Proeme, and indeed ingeniously, that euen as that <HI>Hercules</HI> in <HI>Xeno∣phon,</HI> would not be mou'd a whit at the allurement of pleasures: so no respect of amitie should stir you.

Wherefore, it will please me the better, if you resolue to distinguish this tale (as I may terme it) of our affaires, and successes, from the continued course o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your writings: which containes in it, diuers enterprizes, and many effects, both of counsels, and of the times.

But you know, that in this part, many respects must be con∣sidered.

which de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erue blame.

<P>THE absolute loue you beare mee, appeares in euerie part of the let∣ters which I last receiued from you. Of which loue though I was most assured before now; yet this demonstration was beyond measure acceptable to me; I would saie pleasing, but that I thinke I haue lost this word for euer: and not for the occasion you imagine, and in which, vsing most sweet and friendlie words, in effect, you grieuouslie repre∣hend me; but because for that deepe wound I cannot finde that cure, which may heale it. Alas! I praie tell mee? can I runne vnto my Friends? Where are they? you know of whom I speake; for wee haue found them common to vs both. Others, you know are dead; and others obdurate in their wil, neuer to come to <HI>Rome,</HI> liue in a remote coun∣trie. I could willingly liue with you, and exceedinglie desire it: and, 'tis long since we knew, and lou'd one a∣nother. Our familiaritie is great: our studies alike: what band, or obligation is wanting to vnite vs? may wee then liue together? for my part, I know no impediment; but hitherto, wee haue not so done, though we be neighbours

And do you won∣der then, that I liue remote from that Cittie, where I finde no contentment from mine owne house? and where it is necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rie to beare a great hatred to the times, to men, to publike places; of meeting, and to the Senate?

<P>THough no man is lesse able to com∣fort you, then my selfe; hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken your troubles so to hart, that I my selfe neede consolation. Neuerthe∣lesse my griefe being not altogether so implacable as yours: and seeing you in so terrible an agonie: I thought it an office correspondent to our amitie, and to the loue I beare yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, no longer to defer writing to you, but to administer you some phisicke, which may at least diminish your griefe, though not abso∣lutelie cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it. And that consolation is ordinarie, and well knowne to euery one, of vvhich vvee ought continually to reason, and debate: that vvee beare in minde, that vve are men borne vnder this lavv, that our life must lie open to all the blowes of Fortune. To which
<PB N="234" REF="131"/>
Law, we must not seeke to oppose our selues, in refusing that condition of life, wherein we were borne; rather with patience support those accidents, which humane wisedome cannot preuent: comforting our selues in calling to minde, that nothing happens to vs, that hath not befallen manie others. And though this may yeeld thee cōfort, yet I'le propound a thing to thee, that shall bee of greater force, then this or any o∣ther consolations, which haue bin euer practised, or written by the wise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. I say therefore that considering the mi∣serable e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate of our cittie, and the wic∣kednesse of these times, you will per∣ceiue, that they are truely happie, who haue had no children: and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y lesse vn∣happie, who haue now lost them, then if they had lost them, when the Com∣mon-wealth flourished. It's true, that if thy great losse grieueth thee, in re∣spect of the damage receiued; I see no course to diuert absolutely your griefe. But if naturall affection moue thee, to lament their miseries, that are dead: not to alledge now, what I haue often read, and heard vpon this argument: that there is no euill in death, after which if the soule liueth, it may ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her be ter∣med an immortalitie then a death: and if it die together with the bodie, we must not suppose that there is any mise∣rie, because no sense: leauing I say, this
<PB N="235" REF="131"/>
part aside, I will onely intimate vnto you one reason, which is very true: That such a danger is approaching to the Common-wealth, that euerie man should be glad to auoid with death. For what receptacle, shall honestie, bounty, vertue, laudable customes, good Arts, and finally libertie it selfe, and safetie, now finde? Questionlesse there is ne∣uer a young man or childe, of whose death I haue heard, in this, of all others, most cruell, and pestiferous yeare, which seemes not to me by the gift of the eternall Gods, to haue beene re∣leased from these miseries, and from this so bad a condition of life? So that if I could beate into your minde this o∣pinion; that they whom you haue lost met with no euill, it would in a great part diminish your afflictions. For so you should come to retaine onely that griefe, which you feele not for their death, but for your owne losse. And surely it befits not the grauitie, and wisdome, which since your childhood, you haue alwaies manifested, to de∣spaire for the losse of them, that feele nothing. Remember how you haue liued hitherto, with so great moderati∣on of minde, as it is necessarie for you to perseuere in the same constancie. And by wisedome and discourse, we must anticipate that in our selues, that at length time will bring vs: which by
<PB N="236" REF="132"/>
the remedie of yeares, healeth euerie greene wound. For if there were neuer so base a woman, which in the losse of children, did not at last cease lamen∣ting: surely we are bound to draw that from our prudence, which continuance of daies will bring vs; and not to ex∣pect the medicine of time, which rea∣son first propounds vnto vs. If these letters take effect, I shall thinke that I haue obtain'd my greatest desire: If they worke nothing at all, yet shall I iudge, that I haue done the office, of that friend, which I haue euer beene, and promise during life to be vnto you.

But neuerthelesse you shall doe exceeding wisely, to thinke, that his loue, his valour, and his industrie remaine alwaies with your selfe: those things being no lesse our owne, that we embrace with our mind, then the same, that we behold with our eyes.

And the principall debt, was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as you write, 900. crownes but 570.

Discourteous, in that you ima∣gine a Legate, and an officer of mine, were discharged, not for mine owne, but for my Notaries benefit; especially, when they were not to bee bound, to this inconuenience. Negligent; you supposing, that I neuer sought to bee acquainted with a matter, which did import my office so neerely, as it might proue preiudiciall to me: and that my Notarie, had set downe that, which he thought good, without speaking one word to me: alleaging, that if I had

And on the other side, I haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound out a way, that <HI>Titus Marius,</HI> and others, which put in their securitie for <HI>Valerius,</HI> should not be in any danger to paie it: taking such a course therein, that no man found himselfe grieued, nay, all in generall highly commended mee for it.

But I thought it the part of an honest man, hauing reseru'd to the people, what was be∣longing to them, to preuent the parti∣cular losse of so many good friends, and Cittizens.

I am of your opinion, about giuing in of the ac∣compts, which you are to make: Nei∣ther in this, shall your, and my ac∣compts differ any thing: For you shall adde, that there you left those sommes by my Order; which I neuer put in. Neither haue I any reason to denie you this fauour: and though I had, yet to pleasure you, I would not denie it.

I would willingly amend, if I could that which I left vndone, in giuing vp my ac∣compts. But I must bee circumspect, that herein I cōmit no error, the tearm set downe by the Senate being past. But surely, you haue no reason to be so angry, for I could not otherwise behaue my selfe: although in this, I refer mee to their iudgements, that vnderstand it better then I doe.

which then in courtesie I pro∣pounded. Neither, though you write vnto me, of the sayd three thousand Ducat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, did I receiue your letter wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h that discontentment, as Deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors in these times receiue letters, from their Creditors.

Whereof, whether I com∣plaine, or not, questionlesse, your losse being onely three thousand Crownes, you may endure it with the greater pa∣tience; imagining with your selfe, that the Senate allowed you not so great prouisions, as indeede it gaue you; or, that my selfe gaue you not so much, as I did. For, if you lent mee those three thousand Crownes, yet I am so confi∣dent in your good nature, and in the loue you beare me, that you would not now force me to sell somthing of mine owne, to haue them againe: for other∣wise, I haue no meanes to restore you them. But all that I haue written, e∣steeme it to bee written by way of merriment: And the like doe I, by that you haue written to mee.

<P>I Haue read your letters with content∣ment, by which I vnderstood, that you greatly desire to see mee: Which I imagined, though you had not written it. Neither is my desire in this, inferior to your owne. And so let my thoughts obtaine their wished ends, as I heartily desire to be with you. For, when our Countrey did more abound, then now it doth, with men of valour, and true Citizens, and the number of my friends was greater; yet was there none, with whom I was more willing to conuerse, then with your selfe, and but few, with whom so willingly; but now, some be∣ing dead, other some in remote Coun∣tries, and others not bearing that mind towards mee, they were wont to doe; I should verily thinke one day better spent with you, then all the time I con∣sume with many of those, with whom I conuerse out of necessitie. And I as∣sure you, that solitarinesse would bee much more acceptable to me, (which, notwithstanding, is not granted mee)

Therefore I retire my selfe, as I would wish you also, to our pleasing studies: and withall, I comfort my selfe with the memoriall of my intentions, thinking to my selfe, that I neuer had respect, (as I suppose you conceiue) to priuate benefit, but to pub∣lique safetie. And if hee, whom you could neuer loue, because you loued me, had not borne me enuie; hee, and with him all other good men, had been happy. I would neuer consent, that the violence of any particular man should bee so powerfull, as to suppresse com∣mon libertie. And after I saw those armes, which I euer feared would bee able to doe more, then the consent of good Citizens, who, according to my directions, and examples, vndertooke to defend the Common-wealth: I was of opinion, that discords were rather to be compounded, though vpon vnequall termes, so it we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with securitie, then to fight against those, who were stron∣ger then our selues.

it imports me, I know not what, to delay my departure: that I may ioyne with my friends, to take some course, according to the newes, we shall receiue. Although I cannot tell you, what it is, that should so import mee; matters being growne to that passe, as ouercome who will, the victorie will be the same, though equitie, stand more with the one, then the other part.

But as in good fortune, wee bare our selues moderately, so ought wee to resist this constantly, which is the worst that could haue happened: That a∣mong so many euils, we may enioy this little benefit; that whereas in happie times; it was our dutie to contemne death, in which is felt no miserie; now, being plunged in so many tribulations,

For, though it may touch you neerely, that you are separated from your friends, and your owne fortunes; yet they st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in their vsuall state, nor would they be greatly better'd, by your being present.

For the one victorie I can∣not perceiue, that you are in any such danger, that is not as well euerie

mans ruine as yours. And for the other, I know you no waies stand in feare. It remaines that the generall perill of the Common-wealth, must needs peirce your heart; the which I turne to a kinde of consolation. And though learned men, prescribe many medi∣cines, for this so growen a disease; yet I feare, there is no other true comfort to be found, then that, which is appli∣ed from the fortitude of a mans minde. For if to liue well, and happily, it suffi∣ceth that a man haue a cleare consci∣ence, and doe all things conformable to Iustice: I thinke we cannot properly terme him vnhappie, who is priuie to his owne heart, that his secretest thoughts had neuer other obiect, then honestie. For I cannot imagine, that we left our country, our children, and our fortunes, for any hope of reward: but therein we thought that we discharg'd a certaine iust, pious, and requisite of∣fice, for the Common-wealth, and to our owne honor; not being so foolish, that we should repute victorie certaine. Whereupon if the same ensued, which formerly wee supposed might hap∣pen, when we did enter into the enter∣prize: we must not abandon our selues, as if somthing had hapned, we thought would neuer haue come to passe. Let vs therefore beleeue (as in truth we may) that those things are neuer blam'd
<PB N="258" REF="143"/>
in vs, which proceed from Fortune, and not from our selues: and being exemp∣ted from this blame, we ought patient∣ly to vndergoe those disasters, vnto which, the life of man, is subiect. Out of which reasons I conclude, that there is no man so sunke in miserie, but that vertue is of power, to preserue him. But let the lot fall to whom it will, of euery side you haue hopes, if any hope re∣maine to publicke affaires. And here I remember, how you were wont, to re∣prehend my despaire; and to encourage me to that warre, whereunto you savv me going against my will. At which time I neuer condemn'd our reasons, but our course. For I saw, that we too late opposed those armes, which had been much strengthened by our selues. Wherefore I gaue counsell, that such a warre was to be auoided, wherein force preuailed aboue counsell; and violence, aboue reason. And when I said, that, that would ensue which did; I presa∣ged not what would come to passe: but onely feared lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t those miseries should happen, which I saw were likely to fall out: especially, that if I should haue giuen my censure of one, of two ends, I would surely haue promised that, which was most certaine. For we were superior in those things, which are not vsed in fighting; but inferior in the ex∣perience of armes, and resolution of
<PB N="259" REF="143"/>
souldiers. Now, assume you, I pray ye, that courage, which then you thought I was to take. All the fore-mentioned I haue vvritten, because your <HI>Philargyrus</HI> discoursing before with me, and mou'd as I thinke, out of loyall affection, he told me, how sometimes you would be transported with griefe, which you should by all meanes bridle: being as∣sured, that if the Common wealth re∣turne to her former estate, you may certainely hope, that you shall liue as honorably in the same, as any way is conuenient: and if she remaine desolate and oppressed, you shall haue no worse conditions therein then the rest. And this time, wherein vvee all continue doubtfull, and daunted, ought hereup∣on to seeme vnto you lesse grieuous, because you are in that Cittie, vvhere vertue grew, and was borne; vvhich teacheth vs, how to dispose, and order our liues.

<P>THere is no newes at all; and if there were, I know your Friends certifie you thereof: but of the future though it be hard to speake: neuerthe∣lesse a man may by imagination some∣times come neere it, when the matter is such, that a man may forecast the issue. At this time it seemes onely pro∣bable, that the warre will not long con∣tinue: though some are of contrarie opinion. I thinke that by this time some effect hath ensued: not that I know it certainely, but because wee may easily conceiue as much. First, euery man may expect the victorie; and of all bat∣tailes, the end is ambiguous. Then, the Armie both of one and other side is so
<PB N="265" REF="146"/>
great, and so resolu'd to fight, as it is no great wonder though either of them vanquish. That opinion is euery day confirmed, that although the occasi∣ons of the warre bee different, yet be∣tweene their victories there will bee no great difference. One side wee know, by experience: on the other part, if <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> vanquish, there is no man who doth not forecast, how great feare the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is like to be; both because it is prouoked, and in that it will haue armes in hand. And in relating this to you, if you think that I augment your griefe, whereas I should mittigate it with some consola∣tion: I confesse, that I finde no com∣fort in the common calamities, besides one; the which if you could embrace, were very great, and such as I euerie day make vse of: and this it is. That a man, when hee hath wrought all the good hee is able, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought not to bee di∣sturbed for any contrarietie, that may happen, not hauing deserued it. There∣fore, wee hauing alwaies aduised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the benefit of the Common-wealth, and being rather the blame of Fortune, then of our counsels, that things haue succeeded ill: and in a word; for so much as did belong vnto vs, we hauing neuer beene deficient; we ought to en∣dure that patiently which hath happen∣ed. But yet I will not bee perswaded, that I am able to comfort you, in these
<PB N="266" REF="147"/>
common miseries, wherein a greater wit then mine is required to giue it; and singular vertue, to support it. Ne∣uerthelesse, euery one may easilie shew you, how in particular, you haue no occasion to complaine. For although <HI>Caesar</HI> hath beene more slacke in relea∣sing you from trouble, then we suppo∣sed: yet I know he carries a good af∣fection to you. For concerning others, I doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot beleeue you expect my opini∣on. It remaines, that you grieue, be∣cause for so long time, you are f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from your friends. This is certainely a great discontent: you being separated from the sweetest, and most pleasing chil∣dren in the world. But as before I wrote vnto you, it is now a time, when euery man esteemes his estate very vn∣happie, &amp; rather desires to be in any o∣ther place, then where he is. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or my part repute my selfe most vnfortunate, for being in <HI>Rome</HI>; not onely because in all euils, it is more terrible to behold, then to heare: but in that being heere, I see my selfe exposed to all those acci∣dents, which may happen on a sud∣daine. Although to my selfe, who de∣uise alwaies to com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort you, the know∣ledge of letters, to which I haue euer beene addicted, hath not afforded so great consolation, as the length of time. You may remember how much I haue beene grieued. Wherein the first com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort

is, that I saw more then others; when I desired peace, although the conditions were vnequall. And though I presume not to haue pre∣saged out of my vnderstanding, but in that fortune was pleased to make me p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ognosticate that which ensued: ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am delighted with this vaine praise of wisdome. I finde another consolation, which is common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o vs both: that if I we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e now summon'd to the last period of life, I would not goe vnwilling: for I would thinke by death, to bring my afflictions to an end; and I should de∣part from that Commonwealth, wher∣in it auailes me not to liue. Besides this: I am now old: and I thinke I haue spent my yeares so well, that in one re∣spect, I should die with comfort; and in another, I should not take my selfe to be iniured, though I be forced to passe that period; whether nature her selfe hath almost conducted m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. Finally, there hath died in this warre such a per∣sonage, and so many valiant men haue therein left their liues; that if wee were constrained to die, me thinkes it were indiscretion to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fuse it. For my part, I propound vnto my self<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, all accidents: and there is no euill so great, which I take not to bee neere at hand. But yet I feare not; the vexation being greater, which is caused by feare, then is the thing it selfe which we feare, wherein
<PB N="268" REF="148"/>
there is not onely, no griefe, but wee shall finde, the last period of sorro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. But I'le goe no further: and peraduen∣ture I haue said more then was requi∣site. But, not any delight of many words, but meere good will, drawes my letters out too long. It displeas'd me that <HI>Seruius</HI> went from <HI>Athens</HI>; who because hee was your familiar friend, and one replenished with bountie, and wisedome, should I know, haue euer beene neere about you, and haue giuen you great comfort. My desire is, that as you ought, and your custome is, you would relie on your firme resolu∣tion. I will with all diligence, and care procure that, which I shall thinke to be beneficiall for you, and what may profitablie concerne, either your selfe, or yours.

Questionlesse, both long since, and many times, I would haue written to you, but that expecting dailie better e∣uents, I desired rather to reioyce with you, then comfort you. Euen as short∣ly I hope to doe; which will minister me occasion to write againe vnto you. Now, though I am inform'd and hope, that you contest with Fortune, out of a resolute minde: yet I'le see, whether with these letters, I can adde vnto your forces. I know I am not fit to doe it: but that Authoritie which deriues from great loue, ought to operate very much. Neither will I attempt to com∣fort you, as one afflicted, and depriued of all hopes of safetie: but as a person, of whose safetie, I promise my selfe nei∣ther more nor lesse, then you heereto∣fore were wont to promise your selfe of mine.

If you, through a certaine know∣ledge of <HI>Tuscan</HI> discipline, which you had learned from your Father, who was a noble, and honest Gentleman, tooke not your markes amisse: No more should my prognostication bee

false, being grounded vpon that, which many wise men haue written, and I haue read, as your selfe knowes, with exact diligence. Besides the apprehen∣sion I may haue therein, through my great experience in publike affaires, and for that which I haue obserued in my selfe; to which kinde of prognosticati∣on I giue so much the greater credit, because in present things, so obscure, and troublesome, it neuer deceiu'd me. I would speake of those things which I haue presaged, but that I will not seeme to haue now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eyned that which is come to passe. Yet many can testifie, how in the beginning I aduised <HI>Pompeius,</HI> not to ioyne with <HI>Caesar</HI>: and afterwards that hee should not separate himselfe from him. perceiuing very cleerely, that ioyning with him, the authoritie of the Senate was much impaired; and being separated, a ciuill warre would grow. I was a great friend to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and I loued and honoured <HI>Pompeius</HI>: but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my counsell was loyall to <HI>Pom∣peius,</HI> so both to one, and other it was profitable. Many other things passed, which I foresawe. Because I would not that <HI>Caesar,</HI> to whom I was much bound, should know, that if <HI>Pompeius</HI> had obserued my directions, he should haue beene in high state, and honoured of all the Cittizens; but yet hee should not haue had such a power, as now he
<PB N="273" REF="150"/>
hath. I perswaded <HI>Pompeius</HI> to goe in∣to <HI>Spaine.</HI> If he had gone thither, the ciuill warre had not ensued. I sought not to obtaine, that <HI>Caesar</HI> being out of <HI>Rome,</HI> might stand for the Consulship: but when the people (<HI>Pompeius</HI> the Consull hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lfe, vrging it with great importunitie) had granted it him: I said 'twas good to satisfie him therein. And discerning that this was the seede of ciuill discords, with many reasons, I laboured to extinguish it; reprehen∣ding them which affected not peace: the which, though it were accompani∣ed with vnequall conditions, yet I pre∣ferred it before warre, which on our behalfe was most i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. <HI>Pompeius</HI> knew I spake truth: but there were some so blinde, that to enrich themselues, and effect their desires, holding victorie se∣cure in that <HI>Pompeius</HI> was their Cap∣taine, they saw not the benefit of my Councell. They came to armes: I stirred not: they went out of <HI>Italy,</HI> I staid as long as I could. In briefe, the care of my honor, wrought more in me, then the feare of life. I would not leaue <HI>Pompeius,</HI> because he had not for∣saken mee in my necessities: therefore to shunne infamie, like that <HI>Amphia∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> in the Fables, I expos'd my selfe, to manifest ruine. In which warre no aduersitie fell out, which I had not for∣merly denounced. Seeing therefore
<PB N="274" REF="151"/>
you may perceiue the truth of my rea∣sons, you are bound to beleeue mee, as men vse to beleeue Augures, and Astro∣logers, when they haue once spoken truth. Neither, doe I now goe after dreames, as the Augures are wont to doe, nor doe I marke how the birds flie, nor hearken I how they sing, nor minde how they eate: but I obserue o∣ther signes: which if they be not more certaine then those, yet they are more easie to comprehend, and consequent∣ly, not so fallible. And my Progno∣stication is grounded vpon two rea∣sons. On the one side I consider <HI>Cae∣sars</HI> nature: on the other, that of the ciuill warres. <HI>Caesar</HI> is benigne and clement, iust as he is disciphered in that booke, where you complaine of him. Besides, he loues noble spirits, such as yours is: and finally, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will be ouer∣come, with many mens entreaties: see∣ing, that they are not mou'd out of vaine ambition, but out of office, and charitie. The which all <HI>Tuscanie</HI> doing, 'tis to be thought, shee will be heard. Now, what's the reason, that hitherto, these things haue done little good? For he thinkes, that granting your returne, with whom, it seemes, he hath some cause to be angry; he could not after∣wards deny it many others. Oh, you'le say, what may I hope for then? if he be angry with me? he conceiues, that he
<PB N="275" REF="151"/>
may extract his praises from the same fountaine, by whose drops, hee was formerly made wet, or dashed. Finally, he is a man of great wit, and prudent discourse. He see'th plainely, that he cannot long keepe you out of your Countrie, you being in <HI>Tuscanie,</HI> which is no base part of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alie,</HI> but amongst o∣thers, the most noble: and equall to a∣ny in <HI>Rome,</HI> of the more honourable sort of cittizens of your age, for wit, fauour, and iudgement. He will not that here∣after you should acknowledge this be∣nefit rather from the time, then now from him. I haue spoken of <HI>Caesar</HI>: Now I'le speake of the nature of the ciuill warres. There is no man such an enemy to that enterprise, which <HI>Pomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius,</HI> with great courage, but small preparations vndertooke, that can say, that we haue eyther beene bad cittizens, or bad men. Wherein I am wont to admire the gra∣uitie, iustice, and wisedome of <HI>Caesar</HI>: He neuer speakes but honorably of <HI>Pompeius</HI>: Oh, but he hath perform'd against him, many terribly actions. The blame is not <HI>Caesars,</HI> but of armes, and of the victory. Doe but marke vs: how hath he embraced vs? He made <HI>Cassius</HI> his Legate; He hath giuen the gouern∣ment of <HI>Fraun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> to <HI>Brutus,</HI> and to <HI>Sulpi∣cius</HI> that of <HI>Gracia:</HI> he restor'd <HI>Marcellus,</HI> against whom, he was wonderfully in∣censt, with as great honor, as could be
<PB N="276" REF="152"/>
wisht. What can I therefore inferre? Take the world what forme it will, the nature of things, and of ciuill warres, will neuer permit, but that in one, and the selfe same cause, all may haue the same condition: and that good men, and good cittizens, that are innocent, may returne into that Cittie, where∣into so many guiltie banished men are returned. This is my prognostication: of which if I made any doubt, I would rather vse that consolation, with which you being a valiant man, as you are, I might easily suppose to comfort you: That if you had taken vp armes, for the Common-wealth, (for so you then thought) with certaine hope of victo∣rie, you should not haue beene much to be commended; but had you imagined, it might so come to passe, that we should be vanquish't, the end of warre being vncertaine: it would haue beene a thing most vnbeseeming you, not to haue beene constant in aduerse for∣tune; as you would haue beene discreet, and moderate in prosperous. I would discourse yet farther; how much it would refresh you, to call to mind, that your deeds tended to a good end; And how delight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull your studies would be vnto you in aduersities. I could rip vp vnto you, the fearefull accidents, not onely of auncient, but also of moderne Captaines, that haue beene in this war,
<PB N="277" REF="152"/>
with you. For other mens examples, reducing that law to memorie, where∣unto all men, are constrained to obey, extenuate our griefe. Besides this, I would aduertise you, in how great an hauak and confussion of things we liue: in that we should lesse grieue to be de∣priu'd of our countrie, when it is in ill state, then when it is well: but I would not haue you thinke of this reason. For out of hand, as I hope, nay, rather as I plainely discerne, we shall see you, in honor, and safetie. In the meane while, although I haue at many other times performed this office: neuerthelesse, be∣cause <HI>Caesar,</HI> and his friends do shew me euery day better countenance, I more confidently promise you, my paines, my endeuour, my loue, and my labour. And be assured, that what authoritie or fa∣uour soeuer I doe obtaine, I'le employ it all for your benefit: as formerly I of∣fer'd to your sonne, the true image, no l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse of your minde then of your body, a very well demean'd young man, and exceeding constant in your aduersitie.

<P>I Vnderstand, that my sonne hath not let my booke be seene, doubting (and not without cause) lest he might foolishly erre to our preiudice: consi∣dering that, the same which was writ∣ten, with a sincere meaning, may bee wrested to a contrary sense. And there∣fore if you haue not had it, ascribe the blame to feare, and to the qualitie of our state, worthie doubtlesse of com∣passion. This my misfortune which st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll continues, grew by writing: and in this I know my selfe, more vnfortunate then others. For when a writing is vn∣corrected, by cancelling the error, there is remedie: and when on is a foole, fame giues him due chastisement. But my error is amended by banishment: the sum of which offence is; that being ar∣med I spake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of my aduersary. Accor∣ding to my opinion, there is none of vs, which prayed not for victorie: and which desired not also, when he sacri∣ficed vpon any other cause, that <HI>Caesar</HI> might be suddenly discomforted: If himselfe thinke no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so; he is truely hap∣pie: if he know and conceiue as much; why is he angry with me, for hauing written somewhat, that he would not haue [to be written], he hauing par∣doned

others, who sent vp their pray∣ers to the gods for his ruine. But to re∣turne to the purpose, the reason you had not the booke was this; because I haue written of you, but yet sparingly, and with respect; desire spurring me for∣ward, but feare keeping me backe: whereas, it were requisite, that he that wrote of such an argument should not onely be free from all respects, but be of wit also, and of a valiant, and reso∣lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e minde. 'Tis thought there is a free∣dome to reprehend other mens vices: and yet it must be done with modesty. A man cannot commend himselfe too much, least he seeme arrogant. It is therefore onely lawfull to commend anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r man. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you praise not a man, as much as he deserues, of neces∣sitie, you are to be reprehended, eyther of ignorance, or enuie. But I thinke I did you a pleasure in not commending you so much as you deserued; For when one cannot doe a thing sufficiently, 'tis good to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue it ouer, or at least to touch it but sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghtly. Neuerthelesse I haue v∣sed moderation: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or many things I haue extenuated; many I haue cleane taken away, and many also I haue not set downe. Euen as, therefore, of a Lad∣der, if you take away some steps, cut off other some, and leaue others in ill case, you would make it that no man could ascend thereon: So he that writes any

And when I but name <HI>Caesar,</HI> I feele my selfe tremble; not for feare of punishment, but of his iudgement, because I doe not entirely know his nature. How thinke you, that my minde may stand, when it reuolues with it selfe, reasoning almost after this manner?

Neuerthelesse, I enioyn'd my sonne, that he should read the booke to you, without leauing it in your hands: except you would promise to correct it; that is, wholly to change it. Touching the going into <HI>Asia,</HI> though great necessitie vrged me, yet I haue followed your aduise. About my returne, 'tis superfluous to entreat you: you see the time is come, wherein it must be dilated of. It is needles my <HI>Cicero,</HI> for you to haue any regard to my sonne [herein,] his age, too much af∣fection, and feare, take from him those aduertisements, which in that respect, are requisite. 'Tis fit that you take vp∣on you, all this enterprise. I haue pla∣ced all my hope in you. You absolutely know, out of your wisedome, what things wil delight him, and with what, one may reconcile his fauour.

Nay, I remember the day it selfe: For on the xiii. of May, in the yeere, when <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣lus</HI> and <HI>Marcellus</HI> were Consuls; I comming in the euening into <HI>Pompeia∣num,</HI> you came presently vnto me, with a minde much troubled; A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the griefe did arise partly from thinking on my office; and in part also for my danger. If I remained in <HI>Italie,</HI> you doubted least I should faile in my office: and if I went to the ciuill war; you feared I should runne in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o some imminent perill. At which time you
<PB N="319" REF="173"/>
might perceiue me also, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o disturb'd, and depriued of all counsell, that I knew not how to elect the best. Ne∣uerthelesse, I chose rather to yeelde to the feare of infamie, then to respect mine owne safetie. Which afterwards I grieued at; not so much for feare of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger, as for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he many defects I found there, whither I was gone. First, the Armie was but little and weake: then, except the Captaine, and some few o∣thers, (I speake o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the chiefest) the rest were in the warre it selfe so rauenous, and in wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds so cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>melious, that the victorie it selfe astonish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t mee. I may further adde, that the honourablest Cittizens, of our parts, were much charged with debt, What should I say more? The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was nothing else good; but the occasion of the enter∣prise. Which hauing obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rued, I di∣spairing of victorie, first began to counsell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> peace, as alwaies my custome was. Then <HI>Pompeius</HI> being ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y farre from this opinion, I began to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e him, to draw the warre out at length. Whereunto sometimes hee consent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and said he would doe it; and wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld peraduenture haue so done, if after a certaine encounter, he had not growen too confident in the force of his soul∣diers: neither afterwards, did that man, so highly euer esteemed, any thing beseeming a good Captaine.
<PB N="320" REF="174"/>
With a new Armie, raised in diuerse places, hee ioyned battaile, with tough and lustie souldiers. Whereupon re∣maining vanquished, and hauing lost, euen his lodging Tents, alone re∣proachfully, hee betooke himselfe to flight. And this was my end of the warre: it appearing vnlikely to mee, that being so broken, wee could rest victors, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat wee were not equall, when we were most entire. I departed from that warre, wherein it was neces∣sarie, either by fighting to die; or to light vpon some trecheries; or fall into the hands of the vanquisher; or haue recourse to King <HI>Iuba</HI>; or to bee retir'd into voluntarie banishment; or else make choice to kill my selfe. Certaine∣ly nothing else could thereon ensue; being neither willing, nor daring, to put thy selfe into the Conquerours hands. But of all the foresaid discom∣modities, there was none more tolle∣rable then exile; especiallie to him that is innocent; when no further infamie concurr'd therein: and when you are depriu'd of that Cittie, where you can behold nothing without griefe. I made choice to liue amongst my friends, (if one may say, that any man hath now right in any thing) &amp; yet I was pleas'd, to be with my friends. I prognostica∣ted what did afterwards ensue. I came home, not with hope to remaine there

very contented; but so there were any forme of a Common-wealth, to be re∣sident as it were in my countrie: if there were not; to liue as it were in banish∣ment. Me thought I had no occasion, to offer my selfe death; yet many, to desire it. For we commonl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, that a man should no longer esteeme his life, when hee is no more the same man h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was. But notwithstanding to be guilt∣lesse, is a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nuation of afflicti∣on: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>speci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly hauing two things for my sustentation, the knowledge of the most commend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d arts; and the glorie atchiued by my worth; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e one of which cannot be taken away from mee in life; nor the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her after death. I haue beene trouble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to you, with this so tedious a discourse; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t knowing you to be most louing to me, and the Com∣monwealth, I meant absolutely to lay open my minde vnto you: first, to shew you, how I neuer would condiscend, that the power of one Cittizen should be greater<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then of the whole Com∣monweal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. But after that through some mans fault the forces of one par∣ticular man so encreased, that there was no meanes to resist him, I affected peace: and the Armie being lost, and that Captaine in whom our hopes did liue; my desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was, that all the rest, should haue giuen ouer the warre; but not obtaining this my selfe alone le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it:
<PB N="322" REF="175"/>
and now if this be a Citie, I make ac∣count to be a cittizen; if it bee not, I suppose my selfe to bee an exile, in a place, where I remaine in no worse condition, then if I were in <HI>Rhodes,</HI> or <HI>Mitylene.</HI> I desir'd rather to haue dis∣coursed of these things with you face to face; but because I saw, I should not so soone finde opportunitie, I thought good now to write them: to the end that if you chance to bee in any place, where any speake sinisterly of me, you may know how to defend me. For there are some, who, though my death would no waies aduantage the Common∣wealth; yet they thinke it a great sinne, that I doe liue. And these men, I am certaine, thinke the number of them that were slaine in this warre, to be ve¦ry small: who if they had followed my aduise, though with vniust peace, yet with honour, they might haue liued. For they should haue beene inferior in armes onely, but not in equitie.

But I enuie you not, because you did not see, how many colours came into <HI>Lentulus Crusc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llus</HI> countenance, when he had the repulse. For certainely there was neuer a more delight some thing to behold: and peraduenture he thought it would not so haue past with him: and <HI>Dolabella</HI> himselfe had little hope there∣of. But if our Gentlemen had not had their eyes open; vndoubtedly, he had ouercome his sute: and his opposite would almost voluntarily, haue giuen ouer the enterprise. I doe not thinke you wonder, that <HI>Seruius,</HI> chosen Tri∣bune of the people, should be condem∣ned.

I deferred to write vnto you, because the creation of Ma∣gistrates hanging in suspence, I was en∣forced continually, to attend vnto ne∣gotiations: and partly I was desirous to tarry the end; that so I might aduertise you of euery thing; and supposing they would presently be dispatcht, I expec∣ted till the first of August. The creation of the Praetors, was prolonged, through certaine impediments. I know not how fauourable fortune will be to me, in the creation of the Aediles Curules. It is true, that in that of the Aediles of the people, manifest signes appeared more in fauour of me, then <HI>Hirrus.</HI> Of <HI>Mar∣cus Caelius Vicinianus</HI> I haue no feare. You know how we made a scoffe of him, when he said, that he would put on for the creation of a Dictator. The foole propounded it, and remain'd vili∣fied: and many cries were heard against him.

of the Common-wealth, we did not hi∣therto looke for any new matter. But the one and twentith of Iuly, the Senate being assembled in the temple of <HI>Apol∣lo,</HI> and debating of the stipend that should be giuen to <HI>Pompeius,</HI> there was speech also of those souldiers, which formerly <HI>Pompeius</HI> had lent <HI>Caesar</HI>: how many they were; and how many they should be: so that <HI>Pompeius</HI> being ouer∣come by a continuall importunity, that some ill tongued followes made to him, was vrged to say, that by all meanes he would call backe the said souldiers out of <HI>Gallia.</HI> Afterwards he was demanded his opinion, about sending a successor to <HI>Caesar</HI>: who replied that generally the matter of the Prouinces, should be put off till the said <HI>Pompeies</HI> return: who was to go to <HI>Ariminum,</HI> to the Armie: and presently he went thither. I think it will be treated of, on the xxiij. of August: and without doubt, something will ey∣ther be concluded, or some Tribune shall be nominated, that will not refuse the charge.

not presently propound to the Senate, and the Senate forthwith deliberate of things appertaining to the Common-wealth. Whosoeuer shall oppose; the Senate iudgeth such an one, to haue at∣tempted against the Common-wealth. And if any resist the present decree; the Senate ordaines, that his opinion bee set downe in writing, and bee discussed of in the Senate, and in the present<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the people.

If any man resist this decree, the Senates pleasure is, that his minde be put in writing, and that the matter bee propounded to the Senate and people. This decree <HI>Caius Coelius,</HI> and <HI>Caius Pans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Tribunes of the people, withstood. And besides this; the Senates pleasure is, that the next yeere, the Praetors of the yeere present bee sent, into the Prouince of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and into the other eight Pro∣uinces, which are gouerned by those that haue beene Praetors; and that they that are sent, shall be sent by lot; and if

these bee not so many as may suffice, that Praetors bee chosen out by lot, of the next precedent yeeres, which haue not beene in gouernment; and that they be sent by lot, to the gouernment of the sayd Prouinces. And if there be not so many of these, as may bee suffi∣cient; that one after another, the Prae∣tors of the immediate next yeeres cast lots, that haue not beene deputed to gouernment; and let this bee so long done, while the number of them is made vp, which are to bee sent, to the gouernment of the Prouinces. If any oppose this d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cree, let his minde bee specified in writing to the Senate. This decree, <HI>Caius Coe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius,</HI> and <HI>Caius Pansa,</HI> Tribunes of the people, oppo∣sed. Moreouer, it was obserued by those words of <HI>Cneius Pompeius,</HI> and great hopes therby was conceiued, that hee could not without iniustice, deter∣mine of <HI>Caesars</HI> prouinces, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore the Calends of March: but that after the Calends, hee would thinke there∣upon: And being demanded, what if any man should then oppose? he answe∣red; that it should be as much as if <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> should suborne one, not to suffer the Senate to delib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate; as if openly hee should deny to obey it. And what if he, (said another) would be Consull, and keepe the Armie too? he replied, free from choller. What if my sonne, would
<PB N="394" REF="211"/>
giue me the bastanado? By these words it was collected, that <HI>Pompeie,</HI> and <HI>Cae∣sar</HI> were not of accord. Whereupon, <HI>Caesar,</HI> as I perceiue, will now discend to one of these two conditions; ei∣ther to remaine in the gouernement of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> and so being absent he cannot demaund the Consulship: or else obtaining it, he will depart. <HI>Curio</HI> sets himselfe wholly against him. I know not what he can doe. But I see, that he aymes at a good end, and there∣fore cannot be ruinated. He shewes me great courtesie. But the present hee made me, will redound to my losse. For if he had not giuen me those Panthers, which were brought out of <HI>Africa,</HI> for his sports; peraduenture I had neuer entred into this dance. But seeing I am entred, and that I must celebrate my sports: I put you in mind of that, which so often I haue written; that you'le pro∣cure me some Beast, from those parts.

<P>DOe you thinke that <HI>Hirrus</HI> re∣main'd scorned? but you doe not well know all. For if you knew how ea∣sily, and with how little paines I put him downe, you would blush; calling to mind, how he was sometimes so im∣pudent as to concurre with you. And after this repulse, he laughes with euery man: to counterfeit a good Cittizen, he speakes against <HI>Caesar</HI>: he blames the Senate, for being so slacke to delibe∣rate: he followes <HI>Curio</HI> with ill words: what needes more? this repulse hath made him change nature. Besides this; though he neuer appeared in the <HI>Forum,</HI> and hath little practise in pleading: yet is there not a more courteous aduocate then he. He entertaines and followes euery cause, but seldome after noone. I wrote vnto you, that on the xiij. of August, the matter of the Prouinces would be determined: but because <HI>Marcellus</HI> chosen Consull for the yeare following, was of another opinion, it is put ouer to the first of September. The Consulls were so farre from doing any thing els, that they could not bring many Senators to Counsell. I sent not these, before to day, which is the second

of September: and hitherto no course at all is taken. For any thing I see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this cause will be deferred ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l the next yeare: and so farre as I conceiue, you must leaue one in the gouernment of the Prouince.

Of this I make no doubt: and I meant to write to you thereof, that you might know how to dispose of your selfe. Almost in euery letter I write vnto you of the Panthers. It will be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle credite to you, that <HI>Pa∣tiscus</HI> should send ten to <HI>Curio,</HI> and that you should not send me many more. <HI>Curio</HI> gaue me those ten, with other ten besides, which he had out of <HI>Afri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI>: to the end, you m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y not suppose, that he can onely giue possessions.

So as they appeare not to be very careful, in the necessities of the Common-wealth. But this negli∣gence, or cowardise, or feare, whether we may call it, is couered with rea∣sonable pretexts, making shew that they refuse the Prouince, out of modestie.

Concerning the sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Common-wealth, I haue written ma∣ny times to you, that I can yet discerne no peace. And the more this contro∣uersie encreaseth, further then is con∣uenient, so much more imminent the danger appeares. <HI>Pompeius</HI> is resolued, not to suffer <HI>Caius Caesar</HI> to bee made Consull by any meanes, before hee leaues the armie, and the Prouinces: vpon which the cheefe of the Citie will contest, that <HI>Caesar,</HI> except he first giue ouer his armie, and the one, and other <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llia,</HI> shall not bee created Consull. On the contrarie, <HI>Caesar</HI> is of a constant opinion, that he leauing the armie, his ruine will ensue. Yet he offers this con∣dition, that both of them should leaue off their armie. And so, that loue, and discommendable vnion, turnes not in∣to secret hatred; but to a manifest war. I know not what side to take, and I thinke for the same cause also, you will be much perplexed. For one part I loue, and am beloued: in the other, I hate the opinions, not the men: and I think you know, that euerie one followes the more honest part, while they proceede
<PB N="410" REF="219"/>
without armes: But when they come to a war, the strongest; supposing that to be most honest, which is most se∣cure in this discord: I see, that <HI>Cneius Pompeius</HI> will haue the Senate and Iud∣ges of his party; and to <HI>Caesar,</HI> all those will apply themselues, that liue in feare, or with cold hopes. The armies will not be equall: but there will bee time enough, to consider the forces of ei∣ther part, and to choose the best. I had almost forgot to write one thing to you, which was not to bee omitted. Know you, that <HI>Appius</HI> the Censor does miracles? Know you, that hee abates the pompe of statues, and pictures? that hee allots the measure of land? that hee constraines debtors to pay? hee thinkes the Censorship, is either paste of beane-floure, or niter: but in my opinion, he is deceiued: for, minding to purge himselfe of filthinesse, he opens all his veines, and all his bowels. Run, I beseech you, for Gods and mens sake, and come quickly to laugh at these nouelties; that <HI>Drusus</HI> is constituted Iudge of the accused, by the <HI>Scantinean</HI> Law: and <HI>Appius</HI> is about statues and pictures, I'le promise yee, you haue cause to come in haste.

<P>OVR <HI>Caninius</HI> comming to me ve∣ry late; and telling me, that the day following in the morning, hee was

to come to you: I told him, that in the morning I would giue him a letter; and desired him to returne for it. I wrote in the night, and yet he returned not. I thought he had forgotten it. Yet I would not haue f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iled to send you it by one of mine, if by the foresaid partie, I had not vnderstood, that the day fol∣lowing in the morning, you were to depart from <HI>Tusculanum.</HI> A few daies after, <HI>Caninius</HI> comes early, beyond my expectation; and tels me that euen then he was to come to you; I would not haue that Epistle to be frustrate, which I wrote in the night: and so; though it were old; (especially so much newes hauing since occurred;) yet I gaue it him. And to him, who is a learned man, and your good friend, I deliuered as much by word of mouth, as he by this time ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h communicated vnto you. In my opinion, wee must both shunne the eyes of the mul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude, though their tongues we cannot. For the Victors, exalted in pride through victorie, looke vpon vs as vanquish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: and they who grieue, that our faction hath lost, fret, that we are still aliue. Why then, you will peraduenture say, take not you a course to liue out of <HI>Rome,</HI> as I doe? Because, you go before me, and euery man else in prudence. I thinke all secret things are manifest to you: you neuer erred. Who is so
<PB N="422" REF="225"/>
quicke-sighted, that walking through such darkenesse, may not stumble som∣times? and yet I bethought my selfe long since; that it had beene good, to goe into some part; not to see, nor heare, what is heere done, and spoken<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But after I had considered with my selfe; I imagined, that whosoeuer met me, would surmise at his pleasure; or else, if he suspected nothing, he might say; This man either feares; and be∣cause he is afraid flyeth: or he hath some proiect in his head; and a ship readie prouided. In conclusion, hee that suspected least ill, and knew me peraduenture more inwardly; would thinke that I bare hatred to certaine persons, and that I left <HI>Rome,</HI> for no o∣ther cause, but by reason I could not suffer mine eyes to behold them. These cogitations haue detained me in <HI>Rome</HI> hitherto: besides, that leng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of time, hath by little and little caused as it were an insensibilitie of minde to grow in me, so that it feeles no longer. You haue vnderstood the reasons that kept me in <HI>Rome.</HI> Concerning your courses, I am of opinion, 'twere good for you to staie where you are, till this exulta∣tion be somewhat abated: till it bee knowne what end the warre hath had: for I make no doubt but ended it is: and it auailes much to vnderstand, after victorious successe; what disposition

the Conquerour manifested. Though I may imagine it: yet I expect to vnder∣stand it. If you will follow my coun∣sell, you shall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> goe to <HI>Baiae,</HI> before you see all these reports setled that flie abroad. For it will bee greater honour to vs; then d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>parting from hence, it be thought we are retired into those pla∣ces, rather to mourne, then to bath our selues. But herein, I referre my selfe to your wisedome: I thinke good that we tie our selues to this resolution, to liue together in our studies, and so much the rather, because whereas before, we stu∣died onely for contentment of minde, now we are reduced to such a point, as without the sustentation of letters, our life would faile vs. If any would make vse of our counsell, and endeauour, to recouer the consumed bodie of the Common-wealth; then indeed, leauing studies, wee must runne to the perfor∣mance of so worthie an office; And fortune denying vs this wished occasi∣on, to practise in the Senate, and Fo∣rum; wee will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>race the foot-steps of those so learned, ancients, partly com∣posing as they did, about the true form, of liuing well, and gouerning iustly: partly also in reading their workes. By which studie, if we cannot otherwise, we shall benefit the Common-wealth. This is my opinion. I should be glad, that you would write vnto mee,

<P>YEs indeed will it be a very fit time on the seuenth of the moneth, both in respect of the Common-wealth, and for the season of the yeare. Therefore I am pleased, that you made choice of this day, to which I also referre my selfe. They who followed not our course, we see they now repent them: and though they should doe otherwise, yet should not we repent vs. For wee went to the warre, not out of hope to ouercome, but through a desire, to dis∣charge our duties to our Countrie: and when we left it, we abandoned not our duties, but a desperate enterprise. And so we had a greater care of our honour, then they that neuer stir'd from home: and more wisedome then those, who being vanquisht, and defeated, would not returne home. But aboue all things, it grieues me to see our selues so bitterly checkt by them, that neuer went out of <HI>Rome</HI>: and howsoeuer the matter be: I more esteeme those, that were slaine in

But notwithstanding he hauing writ∣ten that he would come, as I remem∣ber, into the <HI>Alsian</HI> territory: his friends wrote backe againe to him, that he should not come: For many would di∣sturbe him, and he many: and that it were better for him to arriue at <HI>Ponti∣num.</HI> I knew not, wherefore it imported him more, to arriue at <HI>Pontinum,</HI> then about <HI>Alsia:</HI> but <HI>Hirtius</HI> told me, he had vvritten of it to him: and that <HI>Balbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>Oppiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> had done the like: all which three, I knew to be well affected to

you. I meant to aduertise you of his comming, to the end, you might know in what place, or rather in which of these two places, you should prouide you of a lodging: for it is not certainly knovvne, where he will arriue. And I did it also, to informe you, that I am familiar with these men; and that they make me partaker of their counsels. Which, I cannot perceiue, why it should not like me. Although I support what is necessarie to be supported: yet it fol∣lowes not, that I should commend that, which is not praise worthie. Though I know not, what I may not commend; besides the first occasions. For, what afterwards ensued, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll out through our errour. I savv, (for then you were not there) that our friends af∣fected warre, and that <HI>Caesar</HI> desired it not so much, as he feared it not. The warre therefore grew through our de∣fect: what after hapned, could not fall out otherwise: it being of necessitie, that one part must vanquish. I knovv your griefe, was equall with mine, per∣ceiuing tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a slaughter of innumerable Cittizens must ensue, with the death of the one, or other Generall: and besides this; knowing, that there could not be a worser inconuenience, then victorie of ciuill warres: the which I expected not from our enemies onely, but also from our friends: Who terribly threat∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d

And if they had subdued, their victorie would haue bin cruell and immoderate. For th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y beare an incensed minde towardes vs; as if we had taken a course, that would not be as beneficiall to them, as to our selues, if they would haue followed it: or as if it had beene better to haue gone into <HI>Africa,</HI> hoping to ouercome, by meanes of the Elephants; then either to die, or liue with any better Fortune. Oh, we liue, in a turmoyled Common-wealth. I cannot denie it; but let them take care, that haue not prouided for any kind of life. And to come to this point, I haue extended my selfe, further then I would. For hauing euer reputed you, for a man of great worth; I now value you much more: For in this so generall a storme, almost you onely haue had the vnderstanding to retyre you into a Port; where rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing won∣derfull fruits of your knowledge, you intellectuallie discourse of things of such a qualitie, as are much more esti∣mable, then any profit, or pleasur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of these Conquerours. What sweete daies doe you enioy now in <HI>Tusculanum</HI>? This may truely bee termed a life. I vvould I might liue so; free from grea∣ter disturbances. For I could vvillingly

resigne ouer vnto others, all the riches of the world. But I doe what I can to imitate you, and with singular content∣ment, I liue in the repose of studies. And why should not euery man graunt vs, now the Common-wealth, neither can, nor will employ vs, that we may retire to letters? The which, I know, by many learned men, (vvith what reason I cannot tell) were preferred before the Common-wealth. If therefore in the iudgement of famous men, we may ra∣ther applie our mindes to these studies, then to the gouernment of publicke af∣faires: how much more now, when the common-wealth her selfe is content therevvith, may vve follow them hour∣ly?

And thinke not, that I speake this in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east: Because you must note, that letters are alreadie brought mee from the farthest distant Kings that are; wherein they thanke me, for giuing them in the Senate, the title of Kings: the which I had not onlie, not done; but scarcely knew there were any such in the world.

If I shall haue an house; the charge which the law limiteth vs for one day, I'le di∣stribute into ten: but if I cannot meet with a scare, that contents me; I am determined to lie with you.

But seeing in these last letters also, you shew what a care you haue of it: be as∣sured of this, my <HI>Paeto,</HI> that, whatsoe∣uer could bee done with Art, (for now councell s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rues not the turne, some new policie must bee inuented) I say, what by Art may bee attempted, or in∣uented, to purchase the loue of these <HI>Caesarians</HI>: that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue I labou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and procured with all diligence possible: and in my opinion, very successefully.
<PB N="452" REF="240"/>
For, I am so honoured, and reuerenced by them, to whom <HI>Caesar</HI> wisheth well, that I beleeue I am beloued of them. For, though I could hardly discerne true loue from fained, except vpon some occasion, wherein, as gold by the fire, so true loue may bee tried, and knowne by some danger; for other, are but common signes: neuerthelesse, I build vpon this, rather then any other thing, to thinke, that I am heartily, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruely beloued: that, both my fortune, and theirs is such, as there is no cause to dissemble. Then, as for him, who is Lord of all, I see not why I should feare; except in that, there is no security, where reason hath no authority. Nei∣ther can one promise any thing cer∣taine to himselfe, where, on others will (not to terme them appetites) euery thing dependeth. Notwithstanding, I haue not offended his minde in any thing: and therein I haue carefully v∣sed all my dexterity and prudence. For, as other whiles I thought, that it rather appertain'd to mee, then any other, to speake freely; as to him, that had beene a preseruer of the common liberty: so now, seeing it is lost, I thinke it not fit for me, to speak any thing, w<SUP>c</SUP> may offend either <HI>Caesars</HI> minde, or his friends. But, if I should omit the occasion, of some excellent saying, I should lose the opi∣nion conceiued of my wit: the which,
<PB N="453" REF="240"/>
if I could, I would not refuse to doe. But yet <HI>Caesar</HI> himselfe hath a very good iudgement. And euen as your brother <HI>Seruius,</HI> whom I take to haue beene very learned, would readily say, this verse is not of <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tus,</HI> this is; because he was accustomed to read Poets and to note their passages: so I vnder∣stand, that <HI>Caesar,</HI> hauing of himselfe, made volumes of worthy sayings, if a∣ny thing bee presented him for mine, which is not, he vseth to reiect it: and he doth it now much more, because his most familiar friends, leade their whole life almost with me. Now, many things fall, in sundry disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which perad¦uenture, after I haue vttered them, yeeld some sauour of learning and vn∣derstanding; these are of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered to him, together with other conceipts, which daily are inuented: For, so hee hath commanded. From hence it proceeds, that, if afterwards hee heare any thing of me, hee thinkes it not worthy to bee giuen eare vnto. For which cause, I make no vse of your <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omaus,</HI> though by way of merriment, you haue added there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the verses of <HI>Accius.</HI> But what enuy is there? or, what thing is there in me, for which I should be enuied? But suppose, that it is, as you say: I see, that it so pleased the Philosophers, that is, those that seeme alone vnto me, to vn∣derstand the force of vertue: it pleased
<PB N="454" REF="241"/>
them, I say, that a wise man should not bee bound, to render accompt of any thing, but of offence: from which I perceiue my selfe free, two wayes: First, because I alwaies had an vpright mind: next, in that when I saw, there was no meanes to defend our opinions, my conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it was, that we ought not to con∣tend with the more mighty. I cannot th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>refore certainely bee blamed in the office of a good Citizen. It remaines, that I neither doe, nor say any thing rashly, or foolishly against them, that gouerne the Common-wealth. And this also, I deeme to bee a poynt of a wise man. For other things, that which another sayes I haue spoken, or how <HI>Caesar</HI> construes my sayings, or with what fidelity they liue with me, which daily court, and honour mee, of this I cannot be secure. And thus I com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort my selfe, partly with the memoriall of my life past, and partly by liuing now moderately: and that similitude, which the Poet <HI>Attius</HI> makes, I attribute not onely to enuie, but to fortune also: the which, as a weake thing, should be van∣quished, and broken by euery val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant minde; no otherwise, then as a waue, is broken by a rocke.

<P>In stead of violate, he might haue v∣sed ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her word, signifying the same thing: but it would haue sounded too immodest. You see therefore, that a thing is not dishonest that is vttered with honest words: and yet the words alter not the signification: which is a signe, that euery thing is honest by na∣ture. And therefore, if there be no di∣shonesty in things, much lesse in words. So that, if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing signified be not di∣shonest, the word that signifies, cannot be dishonest.

And be∣sides that I am bound, to giue assistance to the Common-wealth; your honor doth so neerely touch mee, that I will therein employ all my councell, ende∣uour, offices, labour, paines, and dili∣gence, to augment your reputation. By which meanes, I know I shall easily dis∣charge my selfe, both to my Country, which to me is most deere; and to our amitie; which in my esteeme, ought by vs most sacredly to be obserued.

That you are desirous to la∣bour a peace between fellow Citizens, I am glad; If you can but quit that peace from seruitude, you shall benefit the Common<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wealth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our owne honour. But if this peace be, to re-esta∣blish that same bad fellow, in the pos∣session of his vnbridled dominion; conceiue that all good men are of this resolution, rather to dye free, then liue in serui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude. And therefore in my iudgement, you shall doe farre more wisely; not to interpose your selfe in this accord: of which, neither Senate, people, nor anie honest man receiues contentment. But these matters you shall vnderstand from others, or else be cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of them by letters.

<PB N="542" REF="285"/>
and my courage tran∣sporting mee further then my wit, I so effected, that the Senate, now crazie, &amp; languishing, seem'd to reassume its for∣mer vigor, &amp; custom. This was the first day, that the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> moued by the efficacie of my words, and acti∣ons, conceiued som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hope of recoue∣ring their libertie. And yet after that, I omitted no time, not onely to bethinke me, but to endeuour something also for the benefit of the Common-wealth. And, if I thought not, that you had par∣ticular aduertisement, by some other meanes, of that which passeth in <HI>Rome</HI>: I, though most busied, would not bee wanting therein, to giue you satisfacti∣on. But I know you shall haue notice thereof, by the letters of some of your other friends: from mee you shall vn∣derstand some few matters, and that briefly. We haue a worthie Senate; the Consulars partly fearefull, and part∣ly ill affected. Great preiudice did ac∣crue by the death of <HI>Seruius Sulpicius. Lucius Caesar</HI> carries a verie good mind: but because hee is <HI>Antonius</HI> Vncle, hee proceedeth not so freely. The Consuls can be no better then they are. <HI>Decimus Brutus</HI> beares himselfe wondrous well: and so does <HI>Caesar</HI> the yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th: who, I hope, will prosecute, as he hath begun.

<P><HI>LEpidus,</HI> by hauing detain'd my posts for nine dayes, was the occasion, that I had more late aduertisement of the battailes fought vnder <HI>Mutina</HI>; al∣though we ought to desire, that the newes of so great a losse to the Com∣mon-wealth should arriue very slow∣ly; especially to them, that can no wayes helpe vs, nor giue vs any reme∣die. And I would to God, that by the same decree of the Senate, with which you called <HI>Plancus,</HI> and <HI>Lepidus</HI> into <HI>I∣talie,</HI> you had likewise imposed vpon me to come thither. Vndoubtedly the Common-wealth had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> receiued a wound so dangerous.

Besides this, if the battaile had beene fought before I had effected my deter∣mination, I doubted that my good in∣tention might by mine aduersaries haue been discouered, &amp; misconstrued; consi∣dering the acquaintance I haue had with <HI>Antonius</HI>: which notwithstanding, was no greater then what <HI>Plancus</HI> had also with him. Whereupon, at <HI>Gades,</HI> in the moneth of Aprill, I embarqued two messengers, in two ships, and I wrote vnto you, to the Consulls, and to <HI>Octa∣uian,</HI> that you would informe me, how I might be best seruiceable to the com∣mon-wealth. But according to my ac∣compt, on the same day that <HI>Pansa</HI> ioy∣ned battaile; on the very same, the ships set out from <HI>Gades</HI>: For since the Winter, there was no setting of Saile before that day.

<P><HI>LVpus</HI> hauing call'd together mee, <HI>Libo,</HI> and <HI>Seruius</HI> your cozen, at my house; what my opinion was, I think you haue vnderstood from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eius Seius,</HI> who was present at that consu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta∣tion.

But the sum is this; which I would haue you well to note, and keepe in minde: That in preseruing the freedome, and safetie of the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> you should not attend vpon the autho∣ritie of the Senate, not yet at liberty. (For, this were a controlling, and reuo∣cation of what you haue done: for, if you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould reduce the Common-wealth to liberty, this you had done by no publique counsell, but of your selfe: and therfore 'twas your greater praise.) and you should inferre, that young (or rather the childe) <HI>Caesar</HI> did foolishly, to embrace so publique a businesse vpon his priuate counsell. Finally, you should make shew, that first you held all the olde souldiers, your war-associates, for fooles; rus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icall men; but valiant per∣sons, and excellent Citizens: as also the <HI>Martian,</HI> and fourth Legion, who

The will of the Se∣nate must bee held for authority, when authority is by feare hindered. Last of all, you haue now twice taken the en∣terprise vpon your selfe: Wherefore, you must sticke to what you haue done, First, the thirteenth of March; and then againe lately; because you assembled a new Armie, and new forces. And ther∣fore you must be so prepared, and pro∣uided for euerie thing, that you stand not vpon commission, in performance of euerie seruice: but, that you effect those matters, that may with wonder∣full admiration, of euerie man, haue al∣lowance.

For all things hung in suspence, by reason of the expectation of the Ambassadours, from whom, as yet, there was no newes, what they had effected.

<P>I Doe not think the Common-wealth more bound to me, then I am to you. And you see verie well, that I cannot be more gratefull to you, then they are to me maglignant. And if it seeme, that I speak this, to apply my selfe to the qua∣litie of the times; I desire your iudge∣ment, rather then all theirs of th'other side. For you, without all passion, and according to truth censure me: which they, hindred by extreme malice, and enuie, doe not. But let them gaine-say at their pleasure, that I may not bee honoured: so they prohibite not, that I may conueniently execute the affaires of the Common-wealth. The which, in how great danger it is, I will explaine vnto you, with the grea∣test breuitie I can possible. First, what a confusion growes in the Citie, by the death of the Consuls, and what a passi∣on
<PB N="580" REF="304"/>
men enter into, when that Magistra∣cie is uacant, you know sufficientlie. I make account I haue written to the full of those matters, that may bee com∣mitted to letters, for I know to whom I write. Now I returne to the busi∣nesse of <HI>Antonius.</HI> Who, after the dis∣comfiture, finding his power to be but a small band of disarmed foot: by set∣ting the bondmen at libertie, and pres∣sing by force all sorts of men, hee hath drawne together a good number of souldiers. Whereunto the force of <HI>Ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idius</HI> was after ioyned; which with a most toilesome march, is arriued at <HI>Vada,</HI> beyond the <HI>Appenine,</HI> where it is vnited with <HI>Antonius.</HI> There are with <HI>Ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idius</HI> of old souldiers, and armed, a verie great number. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onius</HI> intenti∣ons must needs be these; either to re∣paire to <HI>Lepidus,</HI> if hee can be receiued: or to lye vpon the <HI>Appennine,</HI> and the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and scowring the Countrey with his Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llerie, which he hath in abun∣dance, to sacke those parts, which hee scowreth: or to retire againe into <HI>He∣truri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> because that quarter of <HI>Italy,</HI> is without anie Armie. But if <HI>Caesar</HI> had past the <HI>Appenni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> as I did councel him; I had bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght <HI>Antonius</HI> to that streight, that hee should rather by famine, then by sword, haue perished. But neither can wee command <HI>Caesar,</HI> nor <HI>Caesar</HI> his Armie: which are two difficulties of

great consequence. Now matters stan∣ding in these termes, I care not though men, in respect of my selfe, as before I wrote, doe crosse me. But yet I feare, that either fit prouisions cannot bee made, or, that when you shall make them, some obstacle will bee interpo∣sed. I can no longer pay the souldiers. When I took in hand to free the Com∣mon-wealth, I had more then foure millions in readie money. Now, I haue not onely not anie part in mine owne substance; but all the friends I had, I haue engaged. I giue maintenance to seuen Legions; with what difficultie, imagine you. If I had <HI>Varro's</HI> treasures, I could not defray the charges.

For, if I can hardly with effects, returne you equall merit; how should I thinke with words, euer to be able to requite you? I pray you consider well, how matters now stand: for, being wise, as you are; reading diligently my letters, you shall vnderstand euerie thing: I could not, my <HI>Cicero,</HI> pursue presently <HI>Antoniu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> for the reasons I shall alledge vnto you.

I posted presently to my poore companies; for, so I may truely terme them. They are wondrous bare, and through want of all things, in mar∣uellous ill condition. <HI>Antonius</HI> got two daies iourney before me, making much more way in his flight, then I, in his pursuite: for, he fled at randome, and I followed in warlike ordinance. Wheresoeuer he passed, he set slaues at libertie, and tooke by force, whomso∣euer he could: hee staid in no place, till he came to <HI>Vada</HI>: which place I wil discypher vnto you. It lies between the <HI>Appennine</HI> and the <HI>Alpes,</HI> and is almost impassable. I being some 30. miles off him, and he hauing alreadie combined his forces, with those of <HI>Ventidius,</HI> an oration of his was brought vnto mee: wherein hee began to entreat the soul∣diers, that they would follow him be∣yond the <HI>Alpes,</HI> by reason he held cor∣respondencie with <HI>Lepidus.</HI> At this, shouts were raised, and principallie by <HI>Ventidius</HI> souldiers, (for, of his owne, he hath verie few) that they were resol∣ued to die, or vanquish in <HI>Italy.</HI> And moreouer, they began to importune

When I heard this newes, I presentlie sent fiue cohorts to <HI>Pollentia,</HI> before they should arriue there, and tooke mine owne way thi∣therwards. <HI>Trabellius</HI> arriuing with his horse at <HI>Pollentia,</HI> found my men, which I sent to defend it, there, an howre be∣fore: whereat I much reioyced. For, herein I thinke, consists the victorie.

<P>THough I be no waies afraid of mine owne occasions, yet, I am enfor∣ced, out of the loue I beare you, and for your many good offices, to feare yours.

But I beleeue
<PB N="596" REF="312"/>
that either <HI>Labeo</HI> reported these wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds vnto him, or else, they were not vttered by the young man, but rather feyned by himselfe. Besides this, <HI>Labeo</HI> would needes make me beleeue, that the Ve∣teranes, spoke hardly of you, and that some ill would happen you by their meanes: and how they tooke it in de∣spight; that neither <HI>Caesar,</HI> nor I, were elected among the Decemviri: and all things went onelie thorow your hands. Hearing this, and being vpon my waie, I thought good not to passe the <HI>Alpes,</HI> before I first knew, what was done there amongst you. For, of your perill, be assured, that if they can but daunt you wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h brauadoes and thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts; or by putting some crotchets into the young mans head; they hope some great pro∣fit will accrue vnto themselues therby. And all this deuise, depends on the de∣signe they haue, to gaine much. I would therefore haue you circumspect, and keepe your selfe from all embushments.

First, con∣cerning the <HI>Decem-viri,</HI> doe what they would haue you. Then, for the remu∣nerations, if you thinke good, procure that I, and <HI>Caesar,</HI> ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consigne vnto them, the lands of those ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eranes,

(I hauing liu'd in pursute of honours) permitted not, that our mindes might with stronger knot be vnited through conuersation. Neuerthelesse, I knew well your good affection towards mee many yeares before the ciuill warre, when <HI>Caesar</HI> was in <HI>Gallia.</HI> For you pro∣cured, that he wisht me well; honored me; and held me for his owne: the which you thought, could not but turne to my great benefit, and to <HI>Caesar</HI> him∣selfe rather profitable then otherwise. I omit, many things, which in those times, we were wont most familiarly to talke of, write of, and communicate. Because there are other poynts of farre greater consideration. I remember also that in the beginning of the ciuill war, when you went towards <HI>Brundusium,</HI> to finde out <HI>Caesar,</HI> you came to me in <HI>For∣mianum.</HI> First, what esteeme ought to be made of this onely demonstration, especially in those times? Then, doe you imagine, I can forget your dis∣course; councell; and affection? At which, I remember, <HI>Trebatius</HI> was pre∣sent. Neither are your letters out of my mind, which you sent vnto me, at that time when I came to meete <HI>Caesar,</HI> (if I be not deceiued,) in the territory of <HI>Trebula.</HI> Then ensued that time, when I was constrained either by the zeale of mine honour, my dutie, or for∣tune, to goe to <HI>Pompeius.</HI> What office,
<PB N="607" REF="317"/>
or fauour left you vnperformed, eyther towards me absent, or my friends pre∣sent. Whom did all my friends finde more kind to me, and them, then your selfe? I came to <HI>Brundusium:</HI> Now thinke you, that I haue forgotten with what celeritie you came flying to me, so soone as you knew it, from <HI>Taren∣tum?</HI> How great loue shewed you me, in your societie; discourse; and recti∣fication of my minde; which was ouer∣layed with extreame affliction, for the miseries of my countrey? Finally we began againe, to be resident together in <HI>Rome,</HI> where, in matters of great conse∣quence, about the manner, how I should proceed with <HI>Caesar,</HI> according to your aduise, I demeaned my selfe. And in other offices, you did afford this fauour to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and my selfe onely; to come daily to our houses; and often to spend many houres, in acceptable dis∣course. At which time, if you remem∣ber, you vrged me to write these Treatises of Philosophie. And after <HI>Caesars</HI> returne, you intended nothing more effectually, then to make me do∣mesticall with him: Which you obtai∣ned. Now, to what end haue I made this discourse, larger then I thought to haue done? For this respect; because I much wondred, that you who cannot but remember these things, could be∣leeue, that I had wronged our friend∣ship.
<PB N="608" REF="318"/>
For besides these which I haue re∣lated, which are cleare, and euident, I haue many secret passages, which with words, I can scarcely explicate. Your whole carriage giues me satisfaction; but aboue all, I am best pleased, partly [with] your singular fidelitie in friend∣ship; your councell; grauitie; and con∣stancie: and partly [with] your mirth; humanitie; and learning. Wherefore now I returne to your complaint. First, I did not thinke, you had giuen your consent to that Law. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; had I so thought, [yet] I should neuer haue thought, you had done it, without some iust occasion. Your dignitie is so emi∣nent, that all mens eyes are fixed on you; and mens malignitie is the cause, that there is more liberall speech of you, then were befitting. And, if you doe not heare of these mutterings, I know not what to say. I, for my part, when it is my chance to heare them; defend you so farre, as I am sure, you are wont, to defend me against my ad∣uersaries. And I defend you two wayes. Some things there are, which I am ac∣customed absolutely to denie: as parti∣cularly; for this giuing of your voyce: some, which I demonstrate that you haue out of zealous loue, and tender∣nesse performed: as in that, about the charge of publicke sports. But you, who are most learned, know well, that
<PB N="609" REF="318"/>
if <HI>Caesar</HI> were a King, as I suppose he was, you may for the office you vnder∣goe be both praysed, and blamed: prai∣sed; because your faith, and humanitie is to be commended, for louing your friend after death; which reason I am wont to vse: blamed; because our Countries libertie should be preferred before the life of a friend; vpon which your aduersaries ground themselues. I much desire, that the controuersies I haue had about these clamors, might be related to you. But amongst others, there are two speciall particularities in your commendation; which no man infe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s more willingly, or oftner then my selfe: which is, that you perswaded more then any other, that the ciuill warre might be withstood, and the vic∣torie moderated. Wherein I neuer found any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, that was not of my o∣pinion. Wherefore I thanke our <HI>Treba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius,</HI> who was the cause, that I wrote vnto you these letters. To which if you giue no credite, you must needs iudge me very discourteous, and inhumaine: which would wōdrously displease me; and differ much from your owne dispo∣sition. Farewell.</P>

<P>I Tooke great contentment in your letters; because I vnderstood, that you retaine that opinion of me, which I hoped, and wished you should haue. Whereof, though I no waies doubted; yet in that I made grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reckoning, that it might be entirely preserued, it did a little touch me. 'Tis true, that I was priuie to my selfe, that I had committed nothing, that could offend the minde of any honest man. And therefore I did the lesse beleeue, that, you being adorned with infinite and excellent sciences, would be rashly perswaded to any thing; especi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly knowing well, that I euer did, and doe beare you sin∣gular affection. Which, hauing suc∣ceeded, as I wisht; I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer to the false oppositions, against which you haue oftentimes defended me: perfor∣ming an office, answerable to your most ingenuous condition, and worthy of our amitie. For I know what mat∣ters they obiected against me since the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath of <HI>Caesar.</HI> They accuse me, be∣cause I lament the death of a great friend, and that I am afflicted, because a man is slaine whom I loued: aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ming that my countrie should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

before any fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndship: as if they had alreadie made triall, that such a death was beneficiall to the Commonwealth. But I will not argue subti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lie. I con∣fesse, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for mine owne part, I can∣not perceiue it; and that I am not yet arriued to this height of wisedome. Neither did I follow <HI>Caesar</HI> in ciuill dis∣cord: but in that he was my friend, though the course displeased me, yet would I not abandon him. Neither, did I euer approue the ciuill warre, much lesse the occasion thereof: hauing in the very infancie o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, applied all my endeuour, to extinguish it. And there∣fore in his victorie, though he was that great friend vnto me, that he was: I was neith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r delighted with honour, or monie. Of which rewards, others were insatiable, whose power was lesse with him, then mine was. And, on the o∣ther side; my goods by <HI>Caesars</HI> law, were damag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: and by my fauour most of them, that reioyce at <HI>Caesars</HI> death, ob∣tain'd, that they might liue in their countrie. That the cittizens who were vanquished, might be pardoned, I laboured no lesse th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n for mine owne safetie. I therefore, who laboured for eue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y mans pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eruation, should I not greeue for his death, from whom I pur∣chas'd it? especially being hated for their occasion, who murdred him? You shall therefore, vndergoe the penaltie,

(say they) because you dare question that, that we haue acted: Oh pride, neuer heard of! that some may vaunt in their impietie, [and] others can∣not so much as mourne without their ouerthrow. And yet in all ages, ser∣uants haue beene allowed, to feare, to reioyce, and to grieue, rather when they sawe good, then any other. The which libertie, they now, which make profession, to haue giuen it vs, (for so they often report) seeke violently to depriue me o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by threatnings. But they labour in vaine. There shall be no danger so terrible, that shall make me halt in my dutie, or humanitie. For I haue alwaies held, that an honorable death, should neuer be auoided, but rather oftentimes desired. But why should they be angrie with me, for de∣siring them to repent them of what they had committed? I confesse, I would haue euery man to be greeued for the death of <HI>Caesar.</HI> Oh, But I am enioyned by the office of a good Cit∣tizen to desire the safetie of the Com∣monwealth. That this desire is in me, if it be not knowne without my rela∣ting it, both by those things which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eretofore I haue effected, and by those which heereafter I hope to per∣forme; I am content that in defendiug mine owne causes, words may not a∣uaile me. Therfore I earnestly entreat
<PB N="613" REF="320"/>
you, that you will conceiue better of my reasons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen I am able to vtter them: and that you will thinke, if you be of opinion, that it is a good thing to doe well, that I can hold no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner of commerce with bad men. Were it peraduenture fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or me, now, that I am laden with yeares, to goe out of that path, wherein I haue led my youth, which carryeth with it some excuse for error? shall I againe n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w mould my selfe? This error I will not commit: nor will I doe any thing that may dis∣please. Except I doe lament the vn∣happie fortune of my dearest friend, and so great a personage. And if I were of an other minde, I would neuer de∣nie it: least that, besides my being re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>puted wicked in offending, I might be thought timerous, and a false dissem∣bler: T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue it is, that I had the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, of the publike shewes, which <HI>Caesar</HI> the little youth made in honor of <HI>Caesars</HI> victorie. But this had re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pect to a par∣ticular office, not to the state of the Common-wealth. In which charge notw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thstanding, both for the memo∣riall I reserue of so great a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riend, and for the desire I haue to honour him thus dead as he is, I could not be defi∣cient. And the you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of such great hopes, and so worthie of <HI>Caesar,</HI> reque∣sting me ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unto, I was constrained to accept of it.

But what an arro∣gancie is this? That <HI>Caesar</HI> did neuer forbid me, to conuerse with whom I thought good, and euen with persons whom he loued not; and these men that haue bere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d mee of my friend, by carping, or reprehending me, doe their worst to enforce me, nor to loue them that I like well of?

<P>I Suppose, that hitherto the winter hath beene some hinderance, that we could not heare certainely, what you did; and least of all, where you were: neuerthelesse, euerie one affirmed, (out of their desire, as I suppose) that you were in <HI>Syria,</HI> and had forces.

<P>WIth what care, both in the Se∣nate, and with the people, I haue defended your honour, I had ra∣ther you should vnderstand from other friends, then from my selfe.

For, you seeme not onely to fauour vs; as, in respect of the com∣mon-wealth, and for our owne sakes you euer did: but further; to be verie carefull in our behalfe, and to remaine much perplexed. Whereupon, I suppo∣sing you thought, that while the Com∣mon-wealth was supprest, we could haue no repose; and that you were much troubled, in that you doubted of our safetie: I had no sooner receiued the Legions, which <HI>Aulus Allienus</HI> con∣ducted out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> but I presently wrote vnto you; and sent many post's to <HI>Rome.</HI> I also wrote vnto the Senate; but, I appoynted that my letters should not be presented, till you had red them, if my people haue obserued what I commaunded. But, in case my letters haue not beene safely deliuered; I am sure, that <HI>Dolab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lla,</HI> (which killing <HI>Tre∣bonius</HI> by trecherie, hath possessed all <HI>Asia</HI>) hath taken my Corrier's, and in∣tercepted them. All <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Armies which were in <HI>Syria,</HI> are in my power. I haue beene somewhat slow in paying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
<PB N="639" REF="333"/>
souldiers what I promised; [yet] now at length, I find my selfe ridde of care. But, because you know, that I haue re∣fused no perill, nor labour in the seruice of the Common-wealth; And that perswaded, and aduised by you, I haue taken vp Armes, against a faction of wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked rebels; and that I haue not one∣ly assembled an armie, in defence of the Common-wealth, and libertie; but al∣so taken it by force from most cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll tyrants; (whereof, if <HI>Dolabella</HI> had bin Commander, he would haue encreased the forces of <HI>Antonius</HI>; not onely by his going; but with the fame, and expecta∣tion of his armie:) let me intreat you to take mine honour to your protecti∣on. And, if you conceiue, that the de∣serts of the souldiers towards the Com∣mon-wealth be of exceeding impor∣tance: for this, and the causes before alledged, be carefull to ayde, and fa∣uour them. And so procure, that no man may repent him of choosing ra∣ther to follow the Common-wealth; then hope of spoyle, and rapine. In like manner, take vnder your pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecti∣on, so far as in you lyes, the honour of <HI>Marcus,</HI> and <HI>Crispus,</HI> Imperator's. For, that retchlesse <HI>Bassus,</HI> would not assigne ouer vnto me his Legion. So that, if the souldiers in despight of him, had not sent me Ambassadors; he would haue kept <HI>Apamea</HI> beleaguered till by maine
<PB N="640" REF="334"/>
force, it had beene taken. This I request of you, not onely for the Common-wealth's sake, which was euer most deare vnto you; but also in regard of our amitie; which I assure my selfe, you greatly estimate. And be secure, that, this Armie which I haue, is for the ser∣uice of the Senate, and euery honest man, but principally for your selfe. And it both loues, and esteemes you, hea∣ring daily of the affection which you beare it: but if it vnderstand that yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are carefull of their profit, it will also thinke it selfe bound to doe what it is able in your behalfe. After the writing hereof, I heard that <HI>Dolabella</HI> was come into <HI>Cilicia,</HI> with his forces. I will make towardes him, and endeuour to certifie you of the issue. I would for∣tune would graunt me such happinesse, as is answerable to my deserts towards the Common-wealth. Looke to your health, and loue me. From the Campe this seuenth of May. Farewell.</P>

<P>I Hope you are in good health, as I was at the writing hereof. First, wee reioyce for the safetie; and victorie of
<PB N="641" REF="334"/>
the Common-wealth; and then, in that your praises are euery day renew∣ed. For, you proouing a powerfull Consular, and greater then when you were Consull, you haue gone beyond your selfe. Whereat wee doe reioyce, but cannot sufficiently wonder. There is annexed to your vertue, something that is fatall, which we haue now ma∣ny times discerned by experience. For your gowne is more fortunate, then th'armes of other men. Which at this present also, hath wrung the Com∣monwealth, out of the hands of ene∣mies, and restored it. Now, therefore we shall liue in libertie. Now, we shall haue you, most eminent Cittizen; and my dearest, and (in the aduersities of the Common-wealth) approued friend, I say, we shall now haue you, a testimonie of our loue, both to your selfe, and to the Common-wealth, which is so neere vnto you. And those things, which you haue many times promised, both to conceale, while wee were in seruitude; and to disclose in my behalfe then, when they might be auailable: I now, desire not so much that you should vtter them: as that your selfe would but repute them what they are. For I more esteeme of your iudgement then any mans what∣soeuer: neither desire I that you should commend mee aboue my de∣serts.
<PB N="642" REF="335"/>
And these our last exployts will not I hope, seeme dissonant from the rest; nor performed vnaduisedly, and without counsell: but conformable to those cogitations, whereof you are witnesse. Wherefore, you ought to adde no little to my esteeme, that my countrie may entertaine the best hope of me. You haue O <HI>Marcus Tullius,</HI> children, and neighbours beseeming you; and to you wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hilie most deare. You must also in the Commonwealth, next af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er these, make a deare esteeme of those persons, who are emulous of your studies. Of which I desire there may be many; but yet I thinke not, that they are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o great a number, that I must be excluded; and that you haue no place left you, wherein you may embrace mee, and put mee vpon all things which concurre with your plea∣sure, and my desert. I haue peraduen∣ture laide open my minde vnto you: but what my wit is, cannot through long seruitude, be perfectly apprehen∣ded. Wee haue, from the Maritime coast's of <HI>Asia,</HI> and the <HI>Islands,</HI> taken all the shipping we could. The presse of such as were to rowe, though with great opposition of the Citties, was not long in compassing. We followed the Armada of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>labella</HI>; whereof <HI>Lu∣ciliu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was Admirall. Who oftentimes bearing vs in hand, that hee would v∣nite
<PB N="643" REF="335"/>
himselfe with vs; and oftentimes departing from vs; at length bare in with <HI>Corcyrus,</HI> and began to keepe him∣selfe within the port. Leauing it, wee went to <HI>Cyprus</HI>; because we thought it better to returne to the Campe, in that an other Naui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came after; which <HI>Tullius Cymber</HI> had the yeare before, gathered together in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> which was commanded by <HI>Turulius</HI> the Quae∣stor. And from thence; wee thought good with all speed, to giue you notice of what had happened. The <HI>Tarsen∣ses</HI> most disloyall associats, and the <HI>La∣odiceni</HI> farre more foolish, haue volun∣tarily call'd vnto them <HI>Dolobella.</HI> By the aide of which Citties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> vp a kinde of armie, consisting of <HI>Grae∣cian</HI> souldiers. He hath encamped his men before the towne of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> hee hath broken downe a part of the wall, and hath vnited his souldiers with the townes-men. Our <HI>Cassius,</HI> with tenne Legions, and twenty Cohorts of the League, and with foure thousand horse lyes within twenty myles of <HI>Palthos</HI>; and thinkes he may vanquish without comming to fight. Because <HI>Dolabella</HI> is already enforced to buye his wheate at three Tetradrachm's. And, if he cause no prouision thereof to be conueyed in by the shipping of <HI>Laodicea</HI>; hee must of necessitie be shortly famished. And, that he shall not be able to pro∣cure
<PB N="644" REF="336"/>
any such conueyance; by the great fleete of <HI>Cassius,</HI> which is vnder the gouernment of <HI>Sextilius Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI>; and those three, which are vnder the conduct of my selfe, <HI>Turulius,</HI> and <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tichus</HI>; he will easilie be hindered. Be you therefore of good hope, and con¦fident; that as you haue there d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liue∣red the Common-wealth; so wee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or our parts, will therin vse all expedition.

And that <HI>Dolobella</HI> had made these preparations, to the end, that if his hopes in <HI>Syria</HI> were frustrated, he might get aboord, and make for <HI>Italie</HI>; to ioyne with th'<HI>An∣tonij,</HI> and residue of Rebells. Whereof
<PB N="645" REF="336"/>
I was so fearefull, that laying aside all other care, with a few small shipping I made towards him. And, if the <HI>Rhodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> had not crossed me: I had per∣aduenture ended that businesse. How∣so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uer, the greatest number of those ships were taken, and the whole Nauie discomfited. Through feare of our arri∣uall, the Captaines &amp; souldiers fled: and we tooke all the great merchant ships, of what burden soeuer. I am assured, that I haue preuented <HI>Dolabella's</HI> com∣ming with any Nauie into <HI>Italie,</HI> which I greatly feared; and I haue crost his vnion with his Companions, which might haue put you to some trouble. How greatly the <HI>Rhodij,</HI> despaired both of vs, and the Common-weal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, by the publike letters which I haue sent, you may gather. And certainely I haue written lesse of their inraged dis∣position, then in effect I found it. But, that I haue written somewhat thereof, doe not wonder: Their follie is too palpable. Neither did any particular iniuries to my selfe, euer moue mee. Their bad practises against our safetie, their desire of following the factious; their standing out in defiance of euerie honest man; could not by me in reason be supported. And yet I esteeme them not all knaues. But the same parties, who neither receiued my father, when hee fled; nor <HI>Lucius L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tulus</HI>; nor
<PB N="646" REF="337"/>
<HI>Pompeius</HI>; nor other famous Captains; the verie same as it were ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of destinie, are either now themselues in Magistra∣cie; or else haue such therein, as are at their disposing. So that, persisting in doing euill, they shew the same arro∣gancie. And it is not onely profitable to our Common-wealth, but also ne∣cessarie, that such insolencie should bee chastised; which will grow greater, if by impunitie it be supported. As for our honor, I desire, you would haue a care thereof: and when you haue any occasion, either in the Senate, or in any other occurrent, vouchsafe to fauor me. Seeing <HI>Asia</HI> is deputed to the Consuls, and they permitted, that till they come themselues, they may place a Lieuete∣nant in the gouernment; entreat them, at my request rather to conferre this dignitie vpon my selfe then any other, and that they will constitute me Lieu∣tenant, till either of them comes vnto their gouernment. For they haue no occasion to hasten their comming, or to send hither any Armie. For <HI>Dolobel∣la</HI> is in <HI>Syria,</HI> and will, before these men come, be supprest by <HI>Cassius</HI>: as you diuinely foresaw, and did prognosti∣cate. For <HI>Dolabella,</HI> being beaten from <HI>Antiochia</HI>; and in the assault he gaue, ill entreated; distrusting euerie other Ci∣tie, is retir'd to <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> which is vpon the coast of <HI>Syria.</HI> There I hope short∣lie
<PB N="647" REF="337"/>
he will be rowsed, and hauing no place of refuge left him: nor being a∣ble to withstand so great an Armie, as that of <HI>Cassius</HI>; I make no doubt but that ere this time, he is defeated, and subdued. Whereupon I thinke <HI>Pansa,</HI> and <HI>Hirtius,</HI> need not hasten, in their Consulship to come vnto their Pro∣uinces; but rather discharge their Con∣sulship at <HI>Rome</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wherefore if you re∣quest them, that I in the meane while, may haue the managing of <HI>Asia</HI>; I hope you may obtaine it. Besides, <HI>Pansa,</HI> and <HI>Hirtius</HI> promis'd mee by word of mouth, and afterwards wrote vnto me thereof, and <HI>Pansa</HI> affirmed as much to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Verrius,</HI> that he would procure, that during his Consulship, I should haue no successor. Yet I protest that I affect not this prorogation out of any desire I haue vnto the Prouince. For vnto me, it hath euer beene very troublesome, dangerous, and expensiue. But because I would not haue suffered in vaine, so many discommodities, and be vrged to depart from hence, before I reape the last fruites of my laborious industrie. For, if I could send home those somms which I had gathered; I would require a successor: but to get in that which I disboursed to <HI>Cassius</HI>; and that which we lost by the death of <HI>Trebonius</HI>; and by <HI>Dolabella's</HI> crueltie; or by their per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idious proceedings, who failed
<PB N="648" REF="338"/>
both me, and the Common-wealth, against the dutie of their alle∣geance: Which cannot bee done, without time. I am v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged to desire, that you, as your custo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is, would be a meanes, that I may haue this opportu∣nitie. I hope, I haue so borne my selfe towards the Common-wealth, that in reason I may expect, not the benefit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Prouince, but as much as <HI>Cassius,</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI>: not onely, in that I was an associate with them, in that same acti∣on, and daunger; but also because now, I am not wanting, in any valour, or in∣dustrie. For I was the first, that brake the lawes of <HI>Antonius</HI>; the first that drew <HI>Dolabella's</HI> Cauallerie, to take part with the Common-wealth; and that surrendred it to <HI>Cassius</HI>; the first to presse souldiers for generall safetie, against that most wicked conspiracie; and that onely vnited <HI>Syria,</HI> and the Armies that were there, with <HI>Cassius,</HI> and the Common-wealth. For, if I had not giuen so much treasure to <HI>Cassius</HI>; so many men; and with that expedition I did; he would neuer haue attempted to goe into <HI>Syria.</HI> Which if it had not beene, the Common-wealth should by this time haue had no lesse cause, to feare <HI>Dolabella,</HI> then <HI>Antonius.</HI> And all these things I did, notwithstanding, I was a familiar friend, and companion to <HI>Dolabella</HI>; and by neare affinitie
<PB N="649" REF="338"/>
allied to the <HI>Antonij</HI>; and had also by their meanes, gotten my Prouince. But because I bare greater loue to my countrie, I was the first that rais'd war against mine owne familiars. And though I finde, that for these things, I haue not hitherto, had any great re∣compence: Yet am I not altogether out of hope: nor will I hold it trouble∣some resoluedly to perseuer in the de∣sire of libertie only: but in labour al∣so, and in dangers. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uerthelesse if, for the benefit of the Senate, and of all good men, I be also put forward, by some prouocation of iust, and lawfull glorie; wee shall bee in the greater au∣thoritie with others, and consequent∣ly be able the more to assist the Com∣monwealth. When I was with <HI>Brutu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> I could not see your son, because he was then gon w<SUP>t</SUP> the troups of horse to their assigned winter gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ison<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he is so disposed, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>weare vnto you, I reioyce both for yours, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his, but especially for mine owne sake.

But wise men, and of good disposition, hold the matter for truth, and allow thereof. What should I say more? There is great hope in him. 'Tis thought hee will enter into any enter∣prise, that may procure him praise and glory. But <HI>Antonius,</HI> our familiar friend, obserues himselfe to be so generally ha∣ted, as hauing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urprized them in his house, who meant to kill him, he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res not discouer them.

<P>I Thinke there is not a man amongst the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> (much lesse you who knowes all my occasions,) tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conceiues not, what familiaritie I retain with <HI>Lucius Lamia:</HI> For it was manife∣sted to all <HI>Rome,</HI> at the same time, when by <HI>Aulus Gabinius</HI> the Consull he was confined, because valiantly, and freely he had defended my safetie; Neither did our loue grow onely from this; but from an affection which was great, and of long continuance. Whereupon hee refused not to vndergoe any daunger vpon mine occasion. To which offices, or rather deserts, so pleasing a cōuersa∣tion is to be added, that there is no man with whom I ought to be more delighted. Now the reason of so speci∣all loue being made manifest vnto you; I imagine you looke not with what words I recommend him. I would haue you know thus much onely, that if you defend <HI>Lamia's</HI> occasions, his agents, his Free-men, and his very slaues, wherein it shall bee requisite; it shall more satisfie me, then if you had vouch∣safed me this courtesie, in defence of mine own proper substance, and inter∣est's. And I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke no doubt, but with∣out my recommendation, your iudge∣ment

of men is such, that for <HI>Lamia's</HI> owne sake, you will doe any thing very willingly. Although 'twas said, that you were perswaded, that he was present, at the recording of a decree of the Se∣nate, made in preiudice of your honor: whereas he was neuer present at the passing of any decree, vnder those Consulls. And besides this, all the de∣crees that then came from the Senate were false.

I request you, my <HI>Cornificius,</HI> with the greatest efficacie I am able, that you will verily beleeue, that all <HI>Lamia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> negotiations are mine owne: and take order that he may per∣ceiue, that this my recommendation hath beene very vsefull to him.

<P>DOe I then write to you for none, but such as are contentious? And though this be true, yet you cannot say, but I write often to you. For you haue

vs'd the matter so, that no man thinkes he can obtaine your fauour without my letters. But which of your men euer told me, that he came from thence as a messenger, by whom I haue not written backe againe? Or else, being denied to talke with you face to face, what greater recreation doe I finde, then either in writing to you, or reading your letters? I am rather greeu'd, that I am hindred by so many employments, that I haue no conueniencie to write vnto you, as often as I would. For then I would in∣vite you not with Epistles, but with whole volumes: with which in all rea∣son you s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould prouoke me. For though you are employed; neuerthel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse, you haue more leisure then I. If you haue no time to spare, be not so shame∣lesse, and troublesome in importuning me, to write often to you; considering that you write so seldome to me. For if heretofore I haue beene encumbred with many occupations, (for I was bu∣sied in defending the Common-wealth with all care;) much more am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at this present. For euen as they are more grieuously sicke, who seeming to be cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d of a maladie, are relapsed: so doe we feele farre greater disturbance, be∣ing enforced to warre anew, when we thought the warre was almost fini∣shed. But thus much may suffice for these things. You, my <HI>Cornificius,</HI>
<PB N="682" REF="355"/>
labour to perswade your selfe, that I am not of so weake an affection, not to say inhumaine; as that I can be out-gone by you, either in loue, or courtesie. In truth I no wayes doubted of your loue; and yet <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erippus</HI> hath made it me much more manifest. Oh what a man is this! I alwayes tooke him to be fit for my conuersation; but now I apprehend him to be delightsome. As I liue, he hath not onely reuealed your mind vn∣to me, with your owne words, but with your gesture also. So as, doe not feare, that I am offended with you, be∣cause you wrote vnto me in the selfe same forme, as you wrote vnto others. True it is, I was desirous you should write vnto me in another fashion then you wrote to others: but this I did, rather excited by loue, then choller. Touching the charge, you say you are, and haue bin at, in respect of the warre; verily, I cannot ease you. For besides that the Senate by the death of the Consulls, remaines, as it were, without a guide; and there is no way to raise any prou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion; you would not beleeue into what distr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse of moneyes the publicke treasure is brought; which is, on all sides exhausted, to discharge the payes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he best deseruing souldiers, which in my opinion can neuer be wholly dis∣charged, without some new imposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ons. Of <HI>Accius Dionysius,</HI> I thinke there

For <HI>Publius Lucceius,</HI> I graunt not, that you should better affect, then my selfe: for, he is my bo∣some friend: but vrging the Tole-ma∣sters, that they should prolong his time; they made mee apparantly conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iue, that they could not doe it, by the pro∣testation, and oath, that they had ta∣ken. Wherefore I would aduise <HI>Lucc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius</HI> to come home.

But, if you thinke you shall doe it willingly; then let me requ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st you to doe that, which I am to require of you; especially being such, as highly concernes me, and is to you, no way preiudiciall. <HI>Pa∣tro Epicureus,</HI> is wholly mine, and I his: saving that in Philosophie I greatlie differ from him. But both in the begin∣ning, when at <HI>Rome</HI> he obserued you, and yours, he honoured me aboue all others: and lastly, when about his be∣nefits and rewardes, he obtain'd those things which he desired, he preuail'd more by my meanes, then by any other defender, or friend he had: and besides this, he was commended vnto me by <HI>Phaedrus</HI>: who, when I was a child, be∣fore I knew <HI>Philo,</HI> I much esteemed as a Philosopher, and afterwards, not∣withstanding
<PB N="687" REF="357"/>
[our difference of opi∣nions] as an honest man, verie facete, and officious. Now, this <HI>Patro</HI> hauing written to me at <HI>Rome,</HI> that I would procure him your fauour: and request you to graunt him certaine ruines of the house that belong'd to <HI>Epicurus</HI>: I wrote nothing to you thereof; because I was not willing, that your d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>signe of building, should be hindred, by my re∣cōmendation. The same partie, when I came to <HI>Athens,</HI> entreating me once more to write vnto you, about the same matter; obtain'd his request <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon this occasion; in that amongst your friends, it was verily thought; that you had giuen ouer that determination of buil∣ding. And if it be so: and that now you make no reckoning of it: my desire is, that, if you by other mens peruersitie haue beene a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y wayes prouoked (for I know the condition of that people) you would pacifie your minde, by doing something which may be either answe∣rable to your courteous disposition, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending vnto my grace, and honour. I for mine owne part (if you will haue me tell you my opinion) doe not perceiue, why either he should bee so impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tu∣nate; or you so vnwilling to graunt it: except it may be farre lesse allowed in you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o regard so cōtemptible a matter, then in him to craue it. Although I am sure you vnderstand, both with what
<PB N="688" REF="358"/>
words <HI>Patro</HI> excuseth himselfe, and vpon what he groundes. He sayes, hee cannot herein neglect his reputation; the Testament, and authoritie of <HI>Epi∣curus</HI>; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnest entreaties of <HI>Phaedrus</HI>: and that he is engaged, to maintaine that place, where famous men frequen∣ted, inhabited, and conuersed. If wee should reiect this his instant importuni∣tie, we must needs deride his whole course of life, and the profession he ma∣keth of Philosophie. But because we are neither enemies to him, nor to others of that Sect; I am of opinion, that he is excusable, though he be herein so deeply touched. Wherein, if he offend 'tis rather out of follie, then malice. But not to be ouer-long, (for I must at length vtter it,) I loue <HI>Pomponius Atti∣cus</HI> as a brother. I haue not a dearer, nor more acceptabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> friend then him∣selfe.

And, though he be a man, that is not mou'd to doe these offices, out of ambition; neither vseth to be ouer-burdensome in his requests, yet he neuer required any thing of me more eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctuallie.

<P>THe <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laterrani,</HI> are my very kinde friends. For I hauing conferred vpon them a benefit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> note, they haue returned me an ample gratuitie; consi∣dering that they neuer left mee, either in prosperitie, or in miserie.

First, because they shunned the crueltie of <HI>Sylla's</HI> times, through the benignitie of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he gods immortall. And then, because with the great fa∣uour of the people of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me</HI> in my Consulship they they were by me de∣fended. For the Tribunes of the peo∣ple hauing enacted a most wicked law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing their landes, I easilie perswa∣ded the Senate, and people of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat they would haue some respect to those Cittizens, whom Fortune as it were through compassion, had pre∣serued.

Where∣upon the Countie of <HI>Volaterra,</HI> and the towne, was by him perpetuallie free'd from all incumbrance. So as, I may be secure, that he, who was pleas'd to purchase new friends, would continue his old benefits. And therefore, it be∣fits your prudence, either to follow his authoritie; whose part, and gouern∣ment you followed, with great reputa∣tion; or at least to reseru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vnto him, the entire businesse.

And I vnderstand but too well, that the charge y<SUP>•</SUP> was giuen you by <HI>Caius Caesar</HI> was not to iudge, but to execute. Wher∣fore I request you, to do only so much, as I thinke you can, and will for my cause willingly. And, first I would haue you to conceiue it to be true: that all the busines of this towne or Incor∣poration is, that there maine interest lies in this County which paies tribute: and now, through the burdensome im∣positions it hath endur'd, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alne into extreame pouertie. Which inconueni∣ence, though it appeareth that many o∣ther haue equally suffered: neuerthe∣lesse I assure you, that this towne in particular, hath suffered mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then other.

<P>AMongst all the mobilitie, I lou'd no young man so well as <HI>Publius Crassus</HI>; and hauing conceiu'd great hope of him in his tender yeares, I be∣gan to hope better, seeing my iudge∣ment of him, to be verified. Now, you shall vnderstand, that euen when he li∣ued I much esteem'd, and made great accompt of <HI>Apollonius</HI> his Free-man: because he was affected to <HI>Crassus</HI>; and <HI>Crassus</HI> in his vertuous studies made so good vse of him, that he lou'd him dearely. Then after the death of <HI>Cras∣sus,</HI> I thought him also for this cause more worthie of my loue, and to be receiued into my protection; in that he held himselfe bound, to obserue, and honour those, that <HI>Crassus</HI> lou'd, and loued <HI>Crassus.</HI> Whereupon he came to me in <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licia,</HI> and seru'd me in manie occurrents, both faithfully, and pru∣dently. And as I thinke, in the warre of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> hee neuer fail'd you, in whatsoeuer he was able to compasse, either by his fidelitie, or industrie. And hoping that you also had the same opi∣nion of him, he came into <HI>Spaine</HI>; first questionlesse, vpon his owne delibera∣tion, but next for your assistance. Nei∣ther
<PB N="715" REF="371"/>
did I otherwise promise to recom∣mend him vnto you: not but that I sup∣pos'd my commendation would be of some effect with you; but in that I thought he needed not be to you com∣mended, hauing beene with you in the warre; and you for the memoriall of <HI>Crassus,</HI> reputing him in the number of your owne. And, if he would haue sought recommendation, he saw that other men also, would haue done him this pleasure. For the iudgement I made of him, I haue willingly passed my word; both because he esteem'd much thereof, and in that I knew my testi∣monie would be of some credit with you. I say therefore, that I haue found him a learned man; and studious of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcellent sciences; and that euen from his tender yeares.

First, if in making an acquittance to the partie, any securitie be required, that you will vse the meanes, securitie may be giuen him in my name.

I doe not thinke that the <HI>Lacedae∣monij</HI> any waies doubt, but that you wil so receiue them vnder your protection, as befitteth your faith, and equitie; and as their predecessors dignitie deserueth.

<P>I Make no question but you conceiue, how, amongst all those friends your Father left you, I am nearest vnto you; not onely for those reasons, which car∣rie a great apparence of alliance; but al∣so for those, that consist in familiaritie, and conuersation. The which you know, betweene your father and mee were the greatest, and most delight∣some in the world. From these begin∣nings spring the loue which I beare you. Which loue made our amitie greater, then that wee held with your Father. And so much the more, because I perceiued, that so soone as you at∣tain'd to the yeares, to be able to iudge, in what proportion euery one deseru'd to be esteemed of you; that you began to honor, obserue, and loue me aboue all others. Besides all this, we were knit together with a farre firmer knot; as by the knot of studies: which of it selfe greatly imports; especially being of those studies, and those vertues, which of themselues procure, that the parties

<P>I Receiued three letters from you, by <HI>Aristocritus,</HI> which I had almost blot∣ted out with weeping. For, my <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rentia,</HI> I am much afflicted, and so much, that I scarcely liue: yet feele I not more hart-greefe for mine own, then for your miseries; and for those, which all of you haue su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fered. Although in this respect I am more miserable then thou, who art most miserable. For the bit∣ternes of this fortune is equall to vs both, but the blame is only mine. I should either haue accepted of the em∣bassies, by meanes whereof I might haue shunned the danger; or by my friends endeauours haue constantly re∣sisted the iniuries of mine enemies; or else haue dyed with resolution. To a worser state, then that wherein I now stand, I could neuer haue been reduced. Which is the cause, that I greeue not more for the euill, then for the repro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch thereof: being asham'd that my deare wife, &amp; sweet children, by my coward∣dize, and negligence should lead a lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so miserable, and so lamentable. You<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vnhappie state hourely presents it selfe before mine eyes: and because I know

how weake you are of sexe: the more am I sorrowfull, considering that you cannot vndergoe so many troubles without great danger. And besides, I perceiue no hope of my safetie. There are two things, which oppose our de∣sires: the hatred of many; and the en∣uie almost of all men. And as to pre∣serue our former state, little was requi∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: so to recouer it, infinite labour is required. Neuerthelesse, while you are hopefull; I will also support, this my wearie, and languishing body with some hopefulnesse: that in being wan∣ting both to you, and to my selfe, as I haue beene hitherto, despaire may not augment our euills. As for that point, where you write, that I should be wary to remaine in a place of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curitie: this I can easily performe, because mine e∣nemies shall haue small reason to desire my death, in that they should thereby ease me o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so many miseries, which they desire that I should liue in. And yet I will obey your commands. I haue thanked my friends, as you enioyn'd me in your letters, and touching their friendly procurements about my safe∣tie, I haue written, I was therof by you aduertised. The conueyer of these letters was <HI>Dexippus.</HI> For our <HI>Piso,</HI> I haue heard by all men; and I plainely my selfe perceiue it; that he beares vs won∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rfull affection; which with ad∣mirable

The gods grant, that togea∣ther with your selfe, and our children, we may long liue in the soci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tie of such a sonne in law. The hope which now remaines is, whollie in the new Tri∣bunes of the people: and onely in the first daies of their entrie into their of∣fice: for if the matter doe grow sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, tis no more to bethought of. And for this cause, I haue sodainely returnd you <HI>Aristocritus,</HI> that you may presently write vnto me, what beginning the matter had, &amp; in what state it standeth: though I also enioyned <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pus,</HI> that he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould without delay re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urne vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o me. And I haue written to my brother, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>questing him that he will not faile, as often as he can, to send me messengers of purpose.

But yet they were so oppressed, that in the end with great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> slaughter of the enemies, they were taken. And this assault beginning before day light, con∣tinued till two houres within the night. Besides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his, we tooke six small towns, and burnt diuers others. After these e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fects ensued, we pitched at the foote of <HI>Amanus,</HI> call'd by the name of <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x∣anders</HI> Altars; in which place, staying some foure dayes, we spent the time in extinguishing our enemies, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣raging, and wasting that part of <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nus,</HI> which lies against my Prouince.

spurred me forward, to suppresse their insolencie, that others thereat might be astonished, who stood ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stiffe against our dominion. I therefore impaled, and intrenched them, and I beleaguer'd them, with six Bulwares, and encamped about them, with as great an extent as I was able. And I oppugn'd it with Countermures, shelters, and tourrets. And so, battering it with diuers engins, and assailing it with Crosse-bow shot, with great labour, and without any di∣sturbance, or charge to our Associates, I tooke it, within the space of lesse then two moneths. For they within, percei∣uing the Cittie burnt, and ruined on euery side, out of necessitie yeelded themselues. A little beyond, are the <HI>Tibarani,</HI> as wicked and audacious as the former.

And gaue charge to <HI>Quintus</HI> my brother, that he should dis∣perse the Armie, in the taken, and sus∣pected Burroughs. Now be as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ured, I shall repute it for a great honour, if, when these my actions are related to the Senate, you will but approue, that a thankefull demonstration may be made thereof.

such like cases, and to adde their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnest entreaties: neuerthelesse, I thinke it may suffice me, onely to haue giuen you information thereof. Calling to mind, how many times, you haue with your sentences, fauoured me, in how many places exalted, and honoured, and vpon how many occasions benefit∣ted me: your words I euer est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emed of such power, that when soeuer you commended me, I was sure to com∣passe all my pretences. And finally, I remember, when not minding to grant the celebration of a publicke feast, vnto a famous man, and endued with singu∣lar integritie; you said you would grant it him, if it were demanded for ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters effected by him, as Consull in the Cit∣tie. And the same honor you yeelded to me in my gowne: not by vertue of Armes, as it was graunted to many: but, (as neuer any had it;) for my Coun∣tries preseruation.

To which, I will freely answer, because I thinke I can, &amp; ought so to do; aswell by reason of our studies, as for our in∣ward friendship, and also for the dome∣sticall familiaritie, that hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eene be∣twixt our fathers. If euer there were a man, that by nature, (ney, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f mine owne affection deceiue me not) that out of iudgement and learning) neuer reli∣shed the vaine praises, that are giuen by the vulg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; I certainely am that man. And thereof my Consulship can giue testimonie; wherein, as in all my life past, I confesse, I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue practised those courses, from whence a true glo∣rie might ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e vnto me. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet I was

euer of this opinion, that glorie should should not be affected. And that this is true: refused I not, the Prouince assig∣ned to me by the Senate? Which, be∣ing munified, and secure, yeelded mee mee vndoubted hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a Triumph. And when I might with little labour, haue obtain'd the Augurall dignitie, as you cannot but conceiue; did I not contemne it? but after I r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceiu'd that iniurie, which notwithstanding, turn'd to my great renowne; although you euer termed it the ruine of the Com∣mon-wealth; I applied all my endeuor, that the Senate and people of <HI>Rome,</HI> might fauour me, with all titles of ho∣nour, for a signe, as it were, of mine in∣nocencie. Whereupon, afterwards I tooke vpon mee the Augureship, which at first I car'd not for: and the same honour, which the Senate is ac∣customed to grant those men, that by armes haue augmented the State of the Common-wealth, heretofore by mee contemned; I now seeke, that with iust title it may bee also relucent in mee.

And in your consulshippe, though it be my desire, that you should not incounter with many troubles: yet doe I much distaste, that in exchange of so many fauours, which being a young man I haue receiued from you, I at these yeares should not haue the power, to returne you some such gra∣titude, as is befitting. But I thinke it was a certaine influence of the heauens which alwaies opened the way to you,

And now the happie times permits, that vnder your consulship, it hath be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne my fortune, to compasse some laudable effects. Wherefore seeing you are pla∣ced in so high, and honorable a digni∣tie, and occasions are presented vnto me, of being honoured: on the one side I am instigated humblie to intreat, and vrge you to endeauour so, that the Senate may establish a decree vpon my Fortunate successes, with all the fa∣uour &amp; regard y<SUP>t</SUP> can be imagined: on the other; I dare not with you vse ce∣remonies, least I should make you con∣ceiue, that either I haue forgotten the forme which you haue heeretofore vsed in doing me courtesie; or, that I might imagine you are forgetfull.

Withall, that we communi∣cate betweene our selues, you, yours, I, mine occurrents: and finally, to weaue the web of our friendship, which wee haue framed with sundrie obligations: but, through instabilitie of the times, could neuer arriue to it full perfection.

<P>THough each of vs departed from the warre vpon like deliberations, with hope of peace, and hatred of ciuill bloudshed. Yet, being the first, who retired, I am peraduenture the more bound to defend the course that wee had taken: though many times I call to minde, how being together, and con∣sulting of sundrie, and great matters betweene our selues, to prouide for our safeties, we held one opinion, and made one conclusion. Which was; to attend what successe the first battaile would haue; after which, of necessitie it was expedient, that either the whole cause should be determined, or at least our iudgem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt resolued. Which reso∣lution was neuer reprehended, but by those, who maintained, that it was bet∣ter for the Common-wealth to be ab∣solutely dissolued<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then to remaine weakned, and dismembered. And I saw, that if she once perished, al hope of reducing her to her due state, went with her. But if shee were but languishing, there would be yet some comfort. But things haue happened, so farre beyond all mens opinion, as it is a greater mira∣cle, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uer they could fall out, then
<PB N="866" REF="447"/>
that we were not able to foresee, or be∣ing men to presage them. Question∣lesse, I confesse, that I supposed, that af∣ter the fatall battaile fought, the victo∣rious would prouide for common safetie, and the vanquished for them∣selues. But I likewise iudged, that these effects could not grow from any other root, then from suddaine victorie, and humilitie of the vanquished: and had this humilitie beene; they who were in <HI>Africa,</HI> had found in him the same cle∣mencie, which they that went into <HI>A∣sia,</HI> and <HI>Achaia</HI> had experienced. And that without any other mediation, but his owne. But the euill proceeded from this, that times were carelesly let run on; which greatly imparts in ciuill warres. For a yeare and an halfe run∣ning on in this manner, some conceiu'd hope to ouercome, others without hope of victorie, choose rather to die fighting; then to liue, by comming to their enemies for mercie. And of all these disasters, Fortune beares the blame. For who would euer haue thought, that the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> warre, would euer haue drawne to such a length, the warre ciuill? And that one <HI>Pharnaces,</HI> could haue strokē such a ter∣ror into all <HI>Asia?</HI> We concurred all in one election, though with a diuersitie of Fortune; you went into a part, where you might consult, and dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erne the

Wherefore, now know seriously, that you must not take anie iourney, either by land, or sea, till you are perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.

But yet I commend not in anie sort, his course of dieting sicke persons; for I tooke it not to be well done, that hee made you drinke broth, hauing a dis∣tempered stomacke. Notwithstanding, by a letter of mine, I entreat him ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ctually, that he would cure you with all diligence: and in another, I likewise recommend you to <HI>Lyso.</HI> To <HI>Curius,</HI> be∣ing of so sweet a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sposition, full of in∣tegritie, and cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tesie, I haue writ∣ten at large, about your occasions: and among other things, if you so thinke good, that hee should conueigh you to his owne house: because I put no confidence in <HI>Lyso's</HI> diligence: first, because the Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes ordinarily are ve∣rie negligent; and then, in that hee re∣turn'd mee no answer to my letters which he receiued; but you commend

One fauor I require at your hands, my <HI>Tiro,</HI> that you will spare no charge, in things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣quisite for your health. I write to <HI>Curi∣us,</HI> that hee should giue the Physician what you appoint; because it were good, to giue him some thing, to the end, he may attend you with the grea∣ter diligence.

<P>THough I had written to you, but this morning by <HI>Harpalus</HI>: not∣withstanding hauing, a fit messenger, I will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forbeare to make a repetition of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer.

<P>ALthough you haue v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a iust and fit excuse, of not writing vnto me; yet I entreate you not to make a custome of it.

vnto me touching his good will towards me: yet a letter wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten of euery least matter, from you to mee, hath beene euer most acceptab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; wherefore seeing that aboue all things I desire your letters, deale not with me in such sort, that you performe the the dutie of writing, by excuse rather then by daily sending.
