<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. That it is impossible for the <HI>Pen</HI> of any <HI>Historians</HI> writing in (as our's) a divided Age, to please all Parties, and how easie it is to Cavil at any Author.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Uch as lived <HI>after</HI> the <HI>Flood,</HI> and <HI>before</HI> the <HI>Confusion</HI> of <HI>Tongues,</HI> were happy in <HI>this particular,</HI> that they did <HI>Hear</HI> to <HI>Understand,</HI> and <HI>Speak</HI> to be <HI>Understood</HI> with all persons in their <HI>Generation.</HI> Not such their <HI>Felicity</HI> who lived <HI>after</HI> the <HI>Confusion</HI> of <HI>Languages</HI> at the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>Babel,</HI> when the <HI>Eloquence</HI> of the <HI>Best</HI> was but <HI>Barbarisme</HI> to <HI>all,</HI> save a few <HI>Folk</HI> of his owne <HI>Familie.</HI></P>
<P>Happy those <HI>English Historians</HI> who wrote some <HI>Sixty years since,</HI> before our <HI>Civil Distempers</HI> were born or conceived; at leastwise, before there were <HI>House-burnings</HI> (though some <HI>Heart-burnings</HI>) amongst us: I mean, before <HI>Mens latent Animosities</HI> broke out into <HI>open Hostility</HI>; seeing then there was a generall <HI>right understanding</HI> betwixt all of the Nation.</P>
<P>But alass! Such as wrote <HI>in</HI> or <HI>since</HI> our <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> are seldome apprehended <HI>truely</HI> and <HI>candidly,</HI> save of such of their owne <HI>perswasion,</HI> whilest others <HI>doe not</HI> (or what is worse <HI>will not</HI>) understand them aright: And no <HI>wonder</HI> if <HI>Speeches</HI> be not rendred according to the <HI>true intent</HI> of the <HI>Speaker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">☜</NOTE> when <HI>Prejudice</HI> is the <HI>Interpreter</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>This I foresaw when I entred upon my <HI>Church-History,</HI> but comforted my self with the <HI>counsel</HI> of <HI>Erasmus; Si non possis placere Omnibus, place to Optimis</HI>; If thou canst not please all, please the best. In order whereunto I took up to my self this <HI>Resolution,</HI> to <HI>Stere my course</HI> betwixt the <HI>two Rocks</HI> of <HI>Adulation</HI> and <HI>Irritation</HI>; though it seems I have run upon <HI>both,</HI> if the <HI>Animadvertor may be beleeved</HI>; whereof hereafter.</P>
<P>As it is <HI>impossible</HI> in distracted Times to <HI>please all,</HI> so is it <HI>easie</HI> for any at any time to <HI>Cavil</HI> at the <HI>best Performance.</HI> A <HI>Pigmey</HI> is <HI>Giant</HI> enough for this <HI>purpose.</HI> Now <HI>Cavils</HI> may be reduced to these two heads:
<LIST>
<HEAD>Cavils</HEAD>
<ITEM>Without Cause.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Without Measure.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Causeless Cavils</HI> are such as the <HI>Caviller</HI> himself doth <HI>create,</HI> without any Ground for the same; such find a <HI>Knot</HI> in a <HI>Bulrush,</HI> because they themselves before had <HI>ty'd it therein</HI>; and may be <HI>compared</HI> to <HI>Beggers,</HI> who <HI>breed Vermine</HI> in their owne <HI>bodies,</HI> and then <HI>blow</HI> them on the <HI>cloaths</HI> of others.</P>
<P><HI>Cavils without measure,</HI> are, when the <HI>anger</HI> and <HI>bitterness</HI> of the <HI>Caviller</HI> ex∣ceedeth <HI>due proportion,</HI> and the <HI>demerit</HI> of the <HI>Fault</HI>; as when he maketh <HI>Memorie</HI> to be <HI>Iudgement-mistakes; Casual,</HI> to be <HI>Voluntary Errors</HI>; the <HI>Printers,</HI> to be the <HI>Authors faults</HI>: And then brags every <HI>Foil</HI> to be a <HI>Fall,</HI> and <HI>Triumpheth</HI> at the <HI>Rout</HI> of a <HI>small Party,</HI> as at the <HI>Defeat</HI> of the <HI>whole Army.</HI> This Distinction is here premised, whereof hereafter we shall make use as we see just occasion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Why the Author desired and hoped never to come under the Pen of the Animadvertor in a Controversal Difference.</HEAD>
<P>IT was ever my Desire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Care, if it were possible, not to fall under the Pen of the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>; having several reasons thereof to my self, which now I publickly profess:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I knew him a Man of able Parts, and Learning; God sanctifie both to his Glory, and the Churches Good.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of an Eager spirit, with him of whom it was said, <HI>Quicquid voluit valde voluit.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Of a Tart and Smart Style, endevouring to down with all which stood betwixt him and his Opinion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Not over Dutiful in his Language to the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> (what then may <HI>Children</HI> expect from him?) if contrary in Judgment to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lastly and chiefly, One, the Edge of whose keenness is not taken off by the <HI>Death</HI> of his <HI>Adversary</HI>; witness his writing against the <HI>Archbishops</HI> of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Armagh.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Fable tells us that the <HI>Tanner</HI> was the Worst of all Masters to his Cattle, as who would not onely <HI>load</HI> them soundly whilest <HI>living,</HI> but <HI>Tan their Hides</HI> when <HI>dead</HI>; and none could blame one if unwilling to exasperate such a Pen, which, if surviving, would prosecute his Adversary into his Grave. The premises made me, though not servilely fearful, (which I praise God I am not of any Writer) yet generally cautious not to give him any Personal pro∣vocation, knowing that though Both our Pens were Long, the World was Wide enough for them without Crossing each other.</P>
<P>As I desired, so I partly hoped that my <HI>Church-History</HI> would escape the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>: First, because a Gentleman came to me (sent from him, as I supposed) informing me, That <HI>had not Dr.</HI> Heylin <HI>been visited with blindness, he had been upon my bones before.</HI> Then I desired him to return this Answer; That, <HI>as I was sorry for the Sad Cause, the Doctors Blindness; I was glad of the Ioyful Effect, my owne Quiet.</HI> Nor hearing any more for many moneths after, I conceived my self secure from any wind in that corner.</P>
<P>It increased my <HI>Confidence,</HI> because I conceived Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> neither out of <HI>Charity</HI> or <HI>Policy,</HI> would write against one who had been his <HI>Fellow-Servant</HI> to▪ and <HI>Sufferer</HI> for, the same <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Master,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI>; for whose Cause I <HI>lost none</HI> of the <HI>worst Livings,</HI> and <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>best Prebends</HI> in <HI>England</HI>: Onely thus happy I was in my very unhappiness, to <HI>leave</HI> what was <HI>taken away</HI> from the rest of my <HI>Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, seeing no <HI>Birds</HI> or <HI>Beasts of Prey</HI> (except <HI>Sharp-set</HI> indeed) will feed on his own <HI>Kind,</HI> I concluded Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> would not write against me, who conceived my self to be One of his owne Party.</P>
<P>But it seems I reckoned without my <HI>Host,</HI> and now am call'd to a <HI>Rear-account</HI>; I cannot say with <HI>Iob, The thing that I feared</HI>; but, <HI>The thing that I feared not, is faln upon me.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 34 14.</NOTE>However, I conceived my self bound in Duty to <HI>David</HI>'s Command, <HI>Not onely to seek peace, but to pursue it</HI>; though in some sort it fled away from me, being now informed that the <HI>Doctor</HI> was writing against me; wherefore, finding him in <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> and following him at his heels to his <HI>Chamber,</HI> (at a <HI>Stationers</HI> house over again St. <HI>Dunstan</HI>'s Church) I sent up my Name to him by a Ser∣vant of the House, desiring to speak a few Words with him; the <HI>Messenger</HI> went to him, and return'd me this <HI>Answer; That the Doctor was very busie, and could not be spoken with.</HI> Thus my <HI>Treaty</HI> for <HI>Peace</HI> taking no effect, I <HI>armed</HI> my self with <HI>Patience,</HI> and quietly expected the coming forth of his Book against me.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. That after serious Debate the Author found himself Necessitated to make this <HI>Appeal</HI> in his own just Vindication.</HEAD>
<P>HAving perused the <HI>Books</HI> of the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> against me, it bare a strong Debate within me, whether I should pass it over in <HI>silence,</HI> or return an <HI>Answer</HI> unto him, and <HI>Arguments</HI> on both sides presented themselves unto me.</P>
<P><HI>Silence</HI> seemed best, because I <HI>lacked leisure</HI> solemnly to <HI>confute</HI> his <HI>Animad∣versions,</HI> having at this time so much and various Imployment: The <HI>Cow</HI> was well <HI>stocked</HI> with <HI>Milk,</HI> thus praised by the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Virgill Eg.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Poet</HI>;
<Q><L>Bis venit ad Mulctrum binos alit Ubere faetus.</L>
<L>She suckles Two, yet doth not fail</L>
<L>Twice a day to come to th' Pail.</L></Q></P>
<P>But I justly feared, who <HI>twice</HI> a <HI>Lords-day</HI> do come to the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> (<HI>God</HI> knows my Heart I speak it not to <HI>Ostentation</HI>) that I could not <HI>suckle</HI> my <HI>Parish</HI> and the <HI>Press,</HI> without <HI>Starving</HI> or <HI>Short-feeding</HI> of one: Whereas the <HI>Animad∣vertor</HI> in his retired Life gives <HI>no other Milk</HI> then following his own private <HI>Studies.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I suggested to my self, that <HI>the second blow makes the Frey,</HI> and should I rejoyn, probably it would engage me in an endless Contest, with which my declining age could ill comport. I remembred the Man who moved in <HI>Chancery</HI> for a <HI>Gelt Order</HI> which should beget no more; but knew not when any such <HI>Eunuch-Answer</HI> should pass betwixt us, to put a period to the Controversie.</P>
<P>Lastly, our <HI>Saviours counsel</HI> came into my mind, Matth. 5.39. <HI>Resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right side, turn to him the other also.</HI> And al∣though some <HI>Divines</HI> make this <HI>Precept</HI> but <HI>Temporary</HI> (as a <HI>Swadling-cloath</HI> to the <HI>Church,</HI> whiles in the <HI>Infancy</HI> thereof, under <HI>Persecution</HI>;) yet others make it alwaies <HI>Obligatory,</HI> and of perpetual Continuance.</P>
<P>On the other side, the <HI>Distinction</HI> came seasonably to my <HI>Remembrance,</HI> of a Mans <HI>RIGHTING</HI> and <HI>REVENGING</HI> himself; the latter belongs to <HI>God</HI> alone, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rom. 12.19.</NOTE> <HI>Vengeance is mine, I will repay it</HI>; the former <HI>Men</HI> may, and in some cases must do, in their owne fair defence, without <HI>Breach</HI> of our <HI>Saviours Pre∣cept</HI> lately alledged.</P>
<P>I called also to Mind, how in our <HI>Common Law, MUTES</HI> at the <HI>Bar,</HI> who would not plead to the Indictment are Adjudged <HI>guilty,</HI> and therefore justly suspected I should from my <HI>Silence</HI> be concluded <HI>Cast in the Court of Religion and Learning,</HI> for such <HI>Faults</HI> and <HI>Errors</HI> as the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath charged on me.</P>
<P>But most of all it moved me, that <HI>Ministers</HI> of <HI>Gods Word</HI> and <HI>Sacraments</HI> ought to Vindicate their Credits, that so they may be the more <HI>Effectual Factors</HI> for <HI>Gods glory</HI> in their <HI>Vocation.</HI> When our <HI>Saviour went about to Heal the Mans withe∣red hand on the Sabbath day,</HI> Mar. 3.4. <HI>Is it lawful</HI> (said he) <HI>to save Life, or to Kill?</HI> Where I observed, that our <HI>Saviour</HI> accounted <HI>not healing</HI> to be <HI>hurting</HI>; yea, <HI>not curing</HI> to be <HI>killing,</HI> in that person who had <HI>Ability</HI> and <HI>Opportunity</HI> to do it. And by the same Proportion, <HI>not plaistering</HI> is <HI>Killing</HI> of ones wounded Credit, and so consequently I should be <HI>FELO DE SE,</HI> and by my <HI>sinful Silence</HI> be the <HI>Wilful murtherer</HI> of my own <HI>Reputation.</HI></P>
<P>These last Reasons did preponderate with me; and I resolved on two things; to return a <HI>Plain, Full</HI> and <HI>Speedy Answer</HI>; and to refrain from all Railing, which is a <HI>Sick Wit</HI> (if not the <HI>Sickness of Wit</HI>;) and though perchance I may have something <HI>tart</HI> to Quicken the Appetite of the <HI>Reader,</HI> yet nothing <HI>bitter</HI> against the <HI>Credit</HI> of the <HI>Animadvertor.</HI> This my <HI>Answer</HI> I have here Entituled, <HI>The APPEAL unto the RELIGIOUS, LEARNED and INGENUOUS.</HI></P>
<P>But before I close with the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> Comminùs, <HI>Hand to hand; let us first,</HI> Eminùs, try it at <HI>Distance,</HI> and entertain the <HI>Reader</HI> (to his <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> I hope) with my <HI>General Defences,</HI> before I proceed to Answer <HI>each Particular.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Author's <HI>first General Answere</HI> taken from his <HI>Title-page</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> ENDEVOVRED.</HEAD>
<P>MEn may be ranked into <HI>three Forms,</HI> of <HI>INTENDERS, ENDEVOURERS</HI> and <HI>PERFORMERS.</HI></P>
<P><HI>INTENDERS</HI> are the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>lowest Form,</HI> yet so far favoured by some <HI>Papists,</HI> that they maintain, That a good Intention though embracing ill Means, makes a good Action.</P>
<P><HI>PERFORMERS</HI> are the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>highest rank,</HI> to which my Thoughts dare not aspire, but leave this <HI>upper room empty,</HI> to be <HI>filled</HI> by Men of better <HI>parts</HI> and <HI>ability.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>middle Form</HI> consists of <HI>ENDEVOURERS,</HI> amongst whom I took my <HI>station</HI> in the <HI>Title-page</HI> of my <HI>Book, The Church-History of Britain, ENDEVOURED by Thomas Fuller.</HI> And as I did not <HI>hope</HI> that any <HI>Courteous Reader would call</HI> me up <HI>higher,</HI> so I did not <HI>fear</HI> that any <HI>Caviller</HI> thereat <HI>could cast</HI> me <HI>lower,</HI> but that I might still peaceably possess my Place of an <HI>ENDEVOURER.</HI></P>
<P>For, what though I fall short of that which I desire, and strive to perform, I did neither belie my self, nor deceive the Reader, who neither was the <HI>first,</HI> nor shall be the <HI>last,</HI> of whom it may be truly said, <HI>Magnis excidit Ausis.</HI> The <HI>Fate</HI> of many, my <HI>Betters,</HI> who have undertook to compass high and hard Matters.</P>
<P>But it may be <HI>objected</HI> against me, that being <HI>conscious</HI> of my owne <HI>weakness</HI> with the <HI>weight</HI> of the <HI>burden,</HI> I should have left the <HI>Work</HI> for some <HI>stronger</HI> back to <HI>bear,</HI> and quitted it to those who would not only have <HI>endevoured</HI> but <HI>performed</HI> the same.</P>
<P>I <HI>answer</HI>; first, I did <HI>hope,</HI> that what was <HI>acceptable</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> would not be <HI>con∣temptible</HI> to <HI>good Men</HI>; having read, <HI>If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 8.12.</NOTE> <HI>a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</HI> Secondly, seeing this my <HI>willingness</HI> was attended with a <HI>competencie</HI> of <HI>Books, Records, Friends, Intel∣ligence, Strength, Health</HI> and <HI>Leisure,</HI> (be all spoken <HI>not</HI> to my <HI>praise,</HI> but <HI>Gods glory</HI>) I did hope something worth the <HI>Readers acceptance</HI> might be produced. Lastly, though failing in what I undertook, I hoped to perform what might be usefull and advantagious to <HI>abler Pens</HI> undertaking the same task, and to use my owne (as who should forbid) Expression, my <HI>Beams,</HI> might be <HI>Scaffolds</HI>; my <HI>Corner, Filling stones</HI> for his more <HI>beautiful Building.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>premisses</HI> encouraged me to undertake my <HI>Church-History</HI>; wherein, if I have not done what the <HI>Reader expected,</HI> let him consider with himself, whether he did not <HI>expect</HI> what I never <HI>promised.</HI> Who being unwilling to be Cast by the <HI>Verdict</HI> of the <HI>Ingenuous,</HI> for <HI>laying my owne Action too high,</HI> have not <HI>farced</HI> the first <HI>page</HI> of my <HI>Book,</HI> like a <HI>Mountebanks Bill,</HI> pretending no higher but to <HI>ENDEVOUR.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP V. The Second Generall Answer. That many, especially MEMORY Mistakes and <HI>Pen-slips,</HI> must be ex∣pected in a great Volume.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the <HI>Advantage</HI> of a <HI>Small Book,</HI> that the <HI>Authors Eye</HI> may in a manner be <HI>Incumbent</HI> at once over it all, from the Beginning to the End thereof; a Cause why they may be more exactly corrected. A <HI>Garden</HI> hard by ones <HI>House</HI> is easier <HI>Weeded</HI> and <HI>Trimmed,</HI> than a <HI>Field</HI> lying at some distance; <HI>Books</HI> which swell to a great <HI>Volume,</HI> cannot be spun with so even a Thread, but will run <HI>courser</HI> here and there; yea, and have <HI>Knots</HI> in them sometimes, whereof the <HI>Author</HI> is not so sensible as the <HI>Reader</HI>; as the Faults in <HI>Children</HI> are not so soon found in them by their own <HI>Fathers,</HI> as by <HI>Strangers.</HI> Thus the Poet; <HI>Verum opere in Longo Fas est obrepere somnum.</HI></P>

<P>IT is an Act as <HI>easie</HI> as <HI>unjust,</HI> for one to assault a <HI>naked Sentence,</HI> as it stands by it self, disarmed of the Assistance of the <HI>coherence</HI> before and after it: all Sentences (except they be <HI>intire</HI> and <HI>independent</HI>) have a double <HI>strength</HI> in them, one <HI>Inherent,</HI> the other <HI>relative,</HI> and the latter sometimes greater than the former; when what in a Sentence is doubtful, is explained; difficult, expounded; defective, supplyed; yea, seemingly false, rendred really true by the Connexion.</P>

<P>Many times when one Sentence in my Book hath had a <HI>Casual slip,</HI> the next to it out of <HI>Fraternal kindness</HI> would have held it up (in the apprehension of the <HI>Reader</HI>) from falling into any Great Error, had the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> so pleased, who uncharitably cutteth it off from such support, so that <HI>one Brother cannot help another</HI>; whilest he representeth <HI>mangled</HI> and <HI>maimed</HI> Passages, to the Disadvan∣tage of the <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>VVriter</HI> thereof.

<P>THe <HI>first Edition</HI> of a Book, in a difficult Subject, hath ever been beheld as less complete; and a liberty of Correcting and Amending hath been al∣lowed to all <HI>Authors</HI> of this kind.</P>
<P>I will instance in his Book (whose Books would I was worthy to bear) Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s <HI>Britania.</HI> His <HI>first Edition</HI> was a <HI>Babe</HI> in a <HI>little</HI>; the <HI>second,</HI> a <HI>Childe</HI> in a <HI>bigger Octavo</HI>; the <HI>third,</HI> a <HI>Youth</HI> in a <HI>Quarto</HI> (but <HI>Map-less</HI>;) the <HI>last,</HI> a <HI>Man</HI> in a fair <HI>Folio; first</HI> and <HI>last</HI> differing more then a <HI>Gally</HI> and <HI>Galeas,</HI> not onely in the <HI>Greatness</HI> but <HI>Perfection,</HI> every newer Edition amending the Faults of the former.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6"/>Next, we will insist in another <HI>Author above all exception,</HI> even the <HI>Animadver∣tor</HI> himself, who in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Reader,</HI> before the <HI>Second</HI> and much altered <HI>Edition</HI> of his <HI>MICROCOSME,</HI> thus expresseth himself, not unhappily either for his owne or my purpose:
<Q>I am not the first of whom it was said, <HI>Secundae Cogitationes sunt meliores;</HI> neither is it a thing rare for Children of this nature, to be as often perfected as born; Books have an <HI>Immortality</HI> above their <HI>Authors.</HI> They when they are full of <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Guiltiness,</HI> can be retaken into the wombe which bred them, and with a new Life, receive a greater Portion of Youth and Glory. Every Impression is to them another being; and that alwayes may, and often doth bring with it, a sweeter Edition of Strength and Loveliness. Thus with them Age, and each several Death, is but an Usher to a new Birth; each several Birth the mother of a more vigorous Perfection.</Q></P>
<P>Had the like liberty of a <HI>Second Edition</HI> been allowed me, which the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> assumed, his pains had been prevented, and most of the Faults he hath found in my Book (being either derected by my self, or discovered by my Friends, com∣municating the same unto me) had been rectified.</P>
<P>Thus in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue the same word <HI>SECUNDUS</HI> signifieth both <HI>Second</HI> and <HI>Successful,</HI> because Second Undertakings (wherein the failings of the former are observed and amended) generally prove most Prosperous.</P>
<P>But it will be <HI>Objected,</HI> Such <HI>Second Editions</HI> with new <HI>Insertions, Additions</HI> and <HI>Alterations,</HI> are no better than <HI>Pick-pockets</HI> to the <HI>Reader,</HI> who having <HI>purchased</HI> and <HI>perused</HI> the <HI>first Edition,</HI> is by this <HI>new one,</HI> both in his <HI>purse</HI> and <HI>pains</HI> equally abused, and his Book rendred little better than <HI>Waste paper.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>Answer</HI>; First, I am no more obnoxious to this Objection than other <HI>Authors</HI> who set fort New Editions. Secondly, I hope my Alterations shall not be so many or great as to disguise the second from the first Edition; Lastly, I will take order (God willing) for the Printing of a peice of Paper (lesse then a Leaf) in my second Impression, being the <HI>Index of Alteration,</HI> so that the Owners of the <HI>First,</HI> may (if so pleased) in less then an Hour, with their Pens, conform their Books to the new Edition, which though a little less Beautifull to the Eye, will be no less Beneficial to the Users thereof.</P>
<P>Here let me humbly tender to the Readers Consideration, that my <HI>HOLY WARRE,</HI> though (for some Design of the Stationer) sticking still in the Title Page, at the <HI>third Edition</HI> (as some <HI>unmarried Maids</HI> will never be more then <HI>eigh∣teen</HI>) yet hath it <HI>oftner</HI> passed the Press, as hath my <HI>HOLY STATE, MEDITA∣TIONS,</HI> &amp;c. and yet never did I alter <HI>Line</HI> or <HI>Word</HI> in any new <HI>Impression.</HI></P>
<P>I speak not this by way of <HI>Attribution</HI> to my Self, as if my Books came for that first with more Perfection then other Mens, but with <HI>Insinuation</HI> to the Reader, that ti is but equall that I, who have been no <HI>Common Begger</HI> in this Kind, yea never before made use of a <HI>second Edition,</HI> may now have the Benefit thereof allowed me, especi∣ally in a Subject of such <HI>Length, Latitude, Difficulty, Variety</HI> and <HI>Multiplicity</HI> of Matter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Fifth General Answer. That it is no shame for any Man to confess (when convinced thereof) and amend an Error in his Iudgement.</HEAD>
<P>THe Knowledge of our Saviour, <HI>as God,</HI> may be compared to the <HI>Sun,</HI> all perfect and compleat at once without any accession or addition thereunto, whilst his Knowledge, <HI>as Man,</HI> like the <HI>Waxing Moon</HI> was capable of <HI>Increase,</HI> and was (though not subject to the least Error) receptive of clearer <HI>Information</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Luke 2.28.</NOTE> and <HI>Iesus increased in Wisdome</HI>; yea, it is expresly said, <HI>yet learned he Obedience by the thing which he suffered.</HI></P>

<P>When therefore I find my self convinced in my Judgement of an Error in my <HI>Church-History,</HI> by perusing the Notes of the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> I will fairly and freely confesse and amend it.</P>
<P>And I conceive it is no shame at all for a <HI>Childe</HI> to write a few Lines of <HI>Retractation,</HI> after so good a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">St <HI>Augustin.</HI></NOTE><HI>Father</HI> hath set him so fair a Copy thereof.</P>
<P>In such a case let not the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> give me any <HI>Blowes,</HI> where I conceive that my <HI>own Blush</HI> is a sufficient <HI>Penance</HI> for the same; and let him not immoderately insult on such occasions, seeing my <HI>Iudgement-Faults</HI> will be found neither in number nor Nature such as He hath suggested.

<P>Besides, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> is concerned to be civill to me in this Kind, seeing in this particular.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The Sixth General Answer. That <HI>Prelial Mistakes</HI> in Defiance of all Care will escape in the best Corrected Book.</HEAD>
<P>THe most accurate Book, that ever came forth into Light, had some <HI>Mistakes</HI> of the <HI>Presse</HI> therein. Indeed, I have heard of <HI>Robert Stephen,</HI> that he offered a great <HI>Summe</HI> of <HI>Money</HI> (equivalent perchance to <HI>five Pounds</HI> of our <HI>English Coin</HI>) to such who would discover any <HI>Erratum</HI> in his <HI>Folio Greek Testament,</HI> dedicated to <HI>King Francis</HI> the <HI>first.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>But sure I am, that some of our <HI>English Bibles,</HI> which may be presumed set forth with the best Care, <HI>printed</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> have their <HI>Errats</HI>; and therefore <HI>Prelial Faults</HI> being a <HI>catching Disease,</HI> no wonder if my Book as <HI>well</HI> (or rather as <HI>ill</HI>) as others, be subject to the same.</P>
<P>Here it will be <HI>objected</HI> that there is a <HI>known</HI> and <HI>sure Receipt</HI> for the <HI>Cure</HI> of this <HI>Disease, viz.</HI> the <HI>Listing</HI> of such <HI>Faults</HI> as have <HI>escaped,</HI> either in the <HI>Beginning</HI> or <HI>End</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI>; that so the <HI>Reader</HI> may, if he please, <HI>amend,</HI> if other∣wise, <HI>avoid</HI> them. Such an <HI>Index Erratorum,</HI> or <HI>Catalogue</HI> of <HI>Mistakes,</HI> is, in some sort a <HI>STOOL OF REPENTANCE,</HI> wherein <HI>Offenders find</HI> their <HI>lost Innocence</HI>; and such faults thus confessed, are never charged either on the <HI>Author's</HI> or <HI>Printer's</HI> Account.</P>
<P>It is answered, that although such a List of Faults, generally followeth as the <HI>Impedimentum</HI> or <HI>Baggage</HI> in the Rere of a Book, yet seldome or never is it adequate to all the <HI>Errata's,</HI> which are committed therein.</P>
<P>For first, all <HI>committed,</HI> are not <HI>discovered,</HI> neither by the <HI>Corrector,</HI> nor the <HI>Author</HI> himself, who perusing his own Book, in <HI>overlooking</HI> the faults therein, <HI>Overlooks</HI> them indeed, and following the conduct of his own fancy, (where∣in He intended all to be right) readeth the words in his Book, rather as they <HI>should be,</HI> than as <HI>they are</HI> printed.</P>
<P>Secondly, all faults which are <HI>discovered</HI> are not <HI>confessed.</HI> Such as the Printer esteemeth small, He leaveth to be amended by the <HI>direction</HI> of the <HI>Sense,</HI> and <HI>discretion</HI> of the <HI>Reader</HI>; according to the common Speech, that the <HI>Reader ought to be better than his Book.</HI></P>
<P>In my Book, the <HI>Index</HI> of <HI>Errata's</HI> amounts not to above <HI>forty,</HI> a very small number in proportion of so voluminous a Work, which <HI>with Credit</HI> might crave the <HI>allowance</HI> of twice as many more thereunto: The Animadvertor in these his <HI>Notes,</HI> maketh great advantage of some of these <HI>un-confessed-Faults,</HI> and I sometimes plead the mistake of the Press for my Answer, though seldome, save when some <HI>similitude of form</HI> in the mistaken letter rendreth it probable for a <HI>Prelial Error.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Seventh and last General Answer. That an <HI>Author charging</HI> his Margin with his <HI>Author</HI> is thereby Himself <HI>discharged.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HIstorians,</HI> who write of things done at <HI>distance,</HI> many <HI>miles</HI> from their <HI>dwellings,</HI> and more <HI>years</HI> before their <HI>Births,</HI> must either feign them in their owne <HI>Brains,</HI> or fetch them from other credible Authors. I say <HI>credible,</HI> such as carry <HI>worth</HI> and weight with them, Substantial Persons, <HI>Subsidie men</HI> (as I may say) in <HI>Truths</HI> Book; otherwise, for some Pamphlets, and all <HI>Pasquils,</HI> I behold them as so many <HI>Knights of the Post,</HI> even of no Reputation.</P>
<P>Now, for the more credit of what is written, and better assurance of the Reader, it is very expedient that the Author alledged be fully and fairly quoted in the <HI>Margin,</HI> with the <HI>Tome, Book; Chapter, Leaf, Page</HI> and <HI>Columne,</HI> sometimes (seldome descending so low as the <HI>Line</HI>) where the thing <HI>quoted</HI> is expressed; and this done, the <HI>Author</HI> is free from fault which <HI>citeth it,</HI> though He may be faulty who is cited, if delivering a falshood.</P>
<P>Indeed, if one become bound as <HI>Surety</HI> for another, he engageth Himself to make good the <HI>Debt</HI> in the Default of <HI>Principal.</HI> But if he onely be <HI>Bail</HI> for his <HI>Appearance,</HI> and accordingly produceth his Person in <HI>Publick Court,</HI> He ought to be discharged without farther trouble.</P>
<P>Semblably, if one not onely <HI>cites,</HI> but <HI>commends</HI> the words of an Authour,
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
then He <HI>undertakes</HI> for him, <HI>adopts</HI> his words to be his <HI>owne,</HI> becomes his <HI>Pledge,</HI> and consequently is bound to justifie and maintain the truth of what he hath quo∣ted. But if he <HI>barely</HI> alledgeth his words, without any <HI>closing</HI> with them in his Judgement, he is onely bound for that <HI>Author's appearance.</HI> Understand me, to justifie that such words are exactly extant in <HI>manner</HI> and <HI>form</HI> in the place alledged, easy to be found by any who will follow the <HI>Marginal direction.</HI></P>
<P>This I reserve for my <HI>Eighth</HI> and <HI>last Answer,</HI> when taxed by the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> for such things for which I have presented my <HI>Author</HI> in the <HI>Margin.</HI> In such cases I conceive I should be discharged; and, if any <HI>Fees</HI> at all be to be paid, I hope the <HI>Courteous Reader</HI> (on my request) will <HI>remit</HI> them, and <HI>dismiss</HI> me, without more molestation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. That many of the Animadvertors Notes are onely <HI>Additional,</HI> not <HI>Op∣posite</HI> to what I have written; And that all things, omitted in an History, are not Defects.</HEAD>
<P>WHo so beholdeth the Several places in my Book, noted on by the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> hath cause, at the first Blush, to conclude my <HI>Church-History</HI> very <HI>Erroneous</HI> and <HI>full</HI> of <HI>Faults</HI>; out of which, so <HI>bigg a Bundle</HI> of <HI>Mistakes</HI> have been collected: but upon serious Perusal of these Notes, it will appear that a <HI>third part</HI> of them at the least, are meerly <HI>Additional</HI> not <HI>opposite</HI> to what I have written; so that they render my <HI>Book</HI> not for <HI>Truth</HI> the <HI>lesse,</HI> but his for <HI>Bulk</HI> the <HI>greater.</HI></P>
<P>Herein he seemeth like unto those <HI>Builders</HI>; who either wanting <HI>Materials</HI> to erect an <HI>intire house,</HI> or fearing so <HI>frail</HI> and <HI>feeble</HI> a <HI>Fabrick</HI> will not stand by it self, run it along the side-walls of another house, whereby they not onely save <HI>Timber,</HI> but gain strength to their <HI>New Edifice.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> had a Mind to communicate some new <HI>Notions</HI> he had to the <HI>World,</HI> but he found them not <HI>many</HI> and <HI>weighty enough</HI> to fill a just <HI>Book</HI> for <HI>Sale</HI>: whereupon, he resolves to <HI>range</HI> his <HI>Notions</HI> against my <HI>Church-History,</HI> that so partly <HI>carping thereat,</HI> and partly <HI>adding thereto,</HI> he might be∣twixt both make up a <HI>Book</HI> Competent for <HI>Sale.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, it is that sometimes not liking my <HI>Language</HI> (as not <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>expressive</HI> enough) he substituted his <HI>owne,</HI> with <HI>little</HI> or <HI>no variation</HI> of <HI>Matter</HI>; and <HI>some∣times</HI> adds new Passages: some whereof I could formerly have inserted, but be∣cause I perceived my <HI>Book</HI> (as the <HI>Reader</HI> is sensible by the <HI>price</HI> thereof) grown already to too great a <HI>Volume.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Additional Notes</HI> frequently occur, I conceive my self not obliged in the least degree to return an Answer thereunto, as being rather <HI>besides</HI> than <HI>against</HI> what I have written: However, if I have left out any thing, it would have been suspected I had omitted that which most had made against me, to pre∣vent which Jealousie, such <HI>Additional Notes</HI> are also here <HI>verbatim</HI> represented.</P>
<P>To such as object that the <HI>Animadvertor's Additions</HI> are <HI>Suppletory</HI> of the <HI>Defects</HI> in my <HI>Church-History</HI>; I answer, that a <HI>Defect</HI> properly is <HI>Absentia debiti adesse,</HI> the <HI>Absence of what ought to be there,</HI> so that a thing is <HI>maimed</HI> or <HI>lame</HI> with∣out it.</P>
<P>But Additions to an History are reducible to these two Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> either such as they
<Q><L>Must <HI>without</HI> Imperfection be added.</L>
<L>May <HI>without</HI> Impertinency be added.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Few,</HI> if any, of the former; some of the latter kind are found in the Animad∣vertor's <HI>Additory</HI> Notes. And let me tell Him, that if He <HI>writes Books</HI> against
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
all who have <HI>written Books,</HI> and have not <HI>written all</HI> which may be said of <HI>their Subject,</HI> he may even <HI>write</HI> against all who have ever <HI>written Books,</HI> and then He will have <HI>work enough.</HI></P>
<P>Let us go no farther then to his own <HI>Geophraphy,</HI> being sure he is too <HI>Iudicious</HI> to be so conceited of his own pains, as to think he hath inserted all that may be said of so large a Subject.</P>
<P>The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Vit. Aesopi.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Story</HI> is well known of <HI>Aesop</HI>'s Master, who buying two Servants toge∣ther in the <HI>Market-place,</HI> demanded of one of them, what <HI>he could doe</HI>; He an∣swered, that he <HI>would doe all things, doe all things.</HI> Then the other [<HI>Aesop</HI> him∣self] being askt what <HI>he could doe,</HI> answered, He <HI>could doe nothing.</HI> His Master seeming angry to keep so <HI>unprofitable a Servant; How can I</HI> (returned <HI>Aesop</HI>) <HI>doe any thing, when my Fellow-servant will doe all, and leave me nothing to doe?</HI></P>
<P>If Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> hath done <HI>all things</HI> in his <HI>Geography,</HI> he hath given a <HI>Writ of Ease</HI> for ever to Posterity, who may Despair to merit more of that matter. All who hereafter shall write a <HI>new Book</HI> of <HI>Geography,</HI> must also find out a <HI>new World</HI> with <HI>Columbus,</HI> as <HI>anticipated</HI> by the <HI>Doctor,</HI> having formerly completed all on that Subject.</P>
<P>I presume not to say, that I have in my <HI>Church-History</HI> done <HI>all things,</HI> having written many and most material Passages, leaving the rest to others. But this I say, that <HI>all things</HI> left out in a History, are not <HI>wanting</HI>; neither are <HI>all things wan∣ting, Defects,</HI> if not <HI>essential</HI> thereunto. As for some of the <HI>Animadvertors added Notes,</HI> they are no more <HI>needful</HI> or <HI>useful</HI> than a <HI>sixth finger</HI> to a <HI>mans Hand,</HI> as (God willing) in due time shall appear.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. What <HI>Good</HI> the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> might, but would not doe; and, what <HI>Good,</HI> by Gods goodness he Herein hath done unto the <HI>Author.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHen the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> had perused my <HI>Book,</HI> marking some (but making moe) faults therein, it was in his Power to have done me a Pleasure, the greatest he could give, or I receive, <HI>viz.</HI> not to <HI>paradigmatize</HI> me, but by Letter in an amicable way to impart my Mistakes unto me, that I might amend them in my next <HI>Edition.</HI> Say not, He owed me no such thing, who would have beheld it not as a <HI>Debt</HI> paid unto, but <HI>Alms</HI> bestowed upon me.</P>
<P>I was not wholly without hope hereof, having found such favour from some worthy Friends. Had the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> done the like, How had he obliged me? As the Society of <HI>Peter-house</HI> do preserve the Pictures of their Benefactors in their Parlour, so would I have erected unto him a Monument of Gratitude in my Heart, besides my publick acknowledgement of the courtesie.</P>
<P>But it seems He intended not my Information, but Defamation. However, he hath done to me a great good turn, for which (because not intended) I will thank <HI>God, viz.</HI> He by his causeless Carping hath allayed in me the delight in Writing of <HI>Histories</HI>; seeing nothing can be so unpartially and inoffensively written, but some will carp thereat.</P>
<P>Mothers minding to wean their Children, use to put Soot, Wormwood or Mustard on the Nibbles of their Breasts. God foresaw I might Suck to a Surfet in Writing <HI>Histories,</HI> which hath been a Thief in the Lamp of my Life, wasting much Oyle thereof. My Head and Hand had robb'd my Heart in such delight∣ful Studdies. Wherefore he raised the bitter Pen of the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> to wean me from such Digressions from my Vocation.</P>
<P>I now experimentally find the Truth of * <HI>Solomon</HI>'s words, <HI>of making many Books there is no End.</HI> Not, but that all <HI>perfect Books</HI> (I mean <HI>perfect</HI> in <HI>sheets,</HI> otherwise none save Scripture <HI>perfect</HI>) have <HI>Finis</HI> in the Close thereof; or that any Author is so irrational, but He propounds an End to himself before he begins it; but that in <HI>making of many Books there is no end</HI>; that is, the Writers of them seldome or never do attain that End which they propound to themselves, especially if Squinting at sinister Ends, as who is not <HI>flesh</HI> and <HI>blood?</HI> Such as project wealth to themselves, are commonly by unwise managing, or casual miscarriage, impaired
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
thereby in their Estates. Others who designed to themselves, (with the <HI>builders</HI> of <HI>Babel</HI>) to <HI>get them a Name,</HI> commonly meet with shame and disgrace. Or else, when their Books <HI>are ended,</HI> yet they are <HI>not ended,</HI> because though never so cautiously written, some Antagonists will take up the Bucklers against them, so that they must <HI>begin</HI> again after they have <HI>ended,</HI> (or sink in their credits) to write in their own vindication, which is my case, enough to take <HI>off my edge,</HI> for∣merly <HI>too keen</HI> in making multiplicity of Books.</P>
<P>I confess, I have yet one <HI>History</HI> ready for the Press, which I hope will be for Gods Glory and Honour of our Nation. This new-built Ship is now on the <HI>Stocks,</HI> ready to be lanched; and being a Vessel of <HI>great Burden,</HI> God send me some good Adventurers to bear part of the Expence. This done, I will never meddle more with making any Books of this Nature. It is a provident way, be∣fore <HI>Writing leave us,</HI> to <HI>leave of Writing</HI>; and the rather, because <HI>Scribling</HI> is the <HI>Frequentative</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>If therefore my <HI>Petitioning</HI> and <HI>Optative</HI> Amen, shall meet with Gods <HI>Commis∣sioning</HI> and <HI>Imperative</HI> Amen, I will hereafter totally attend the Concernments of my Calling, and what directly and immediately shall tend to the advance of Devotion in my Self and in Others, as preparatory to my Dissolution out of this state of Mortality.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. That the <HI>Author</HI> is unjustly charged by the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> for being <HI>agreeable to the Times;</HI> And how far forth such <HI>Agreeableness</HI> is consistent with <HI>Christian Prudence.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Page. 268. towards the bottom there∣of</NOTE>THe <HI>Animadvertor</HI> is pleased to Charge me to be a great <HI>Temporizer,</HI> and <HI>agreeable to the Times.</HI> In Order to my Defence herein, let me premise this <HI>Distinction</HI>; that there is a <HI>Sinful</HI> and <HI>Sinless Agreeableness with the Times,</HI> be they never so bad.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>Sinful Agreeableness,</HI> when People for their private <HI>profit,</HI> or <HI>safety,</HI> or both, are resolved in <HI>Belief</HI> and <HI>Life; Faith,</HI> and <HI>Fact; Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> to be the same with the <HI>Times</HI>; how contrary soever they be unto the <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> Be it <HI>BIBLE,</HI> or <HI>THALMUD,</HI> or <HI>ALCORAN,</HI> or <HI>MASSE-BOOK,</HI> or <HI>COMMON-PRAYER-BOOK,</HI> or <HI>DIRECTORY; any, many, all,</HI> or <HI>no Manner</HI> of <HI>God's publick Service</HI>; to them, all is alike, and equally imbraced.</P>
<P>But there is also a <HI>Sinless,</HI> yea lawful and necessary <HI>agreeableness</HI> to the <HI>Times,</HI> insomuch that no meaner Father than St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> or worse <HI>Critick</HI> than <HI>Erasmus,</HI> read the Text <HI>Romans</HI> 12.11. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Serving the Time.</HI> A <HI>Reading</HI> countenanced by the Context, <HI>Rejoycing in Hope, patient in Tribulation, continu∣ing in Prayer</HI>; all being Directions of our demeanour in dangerous times. And even those who dislike the <HI>Reading</HI> as false, defend the <HI>Doctrine</HI> as <HI>true</HI>; that though we must not be <HI>Slaves</HI> and <HI>Vassals,</HI> we may be <HI>Servants to the Times,</HI> so far forth as not to <HI>Dis-serve</HI> God thereby.</P>
<P>This <HI>Sinless</HI> and <HI>lawful Agreeableness with the Times,</HI> is partly <HI>Passive,</HI> partly <HI>Active. Passive</HI> chiefly consisteth in <HI>Bearing</HI> and <HI>Forbearing: Bearing,</HI> in paying all Pecuniary burdens imposed; it being but equal (in my opinion) there to return <HI>Tribute</HI> where we receive <HI>Protection.</HI> I doubt not but in this point even the <HI>Animadver∣tor</HI> himself is <HI>agreeable to the Times,</HI> going along with the rest of his Neighbours in their paying of all publick Taxes.</P>
<P><HI>Forbearing</HI> expresseth it self, first in <HI>Silence.</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> Proverb, true at all, is necessary in dangerous, Times, <HI>Where the mouth is shut no Fly doth enter</HI>: Yea, the Spirit of God giveth his Servants this counsel, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Amos 5.13.</NOTE> <HI>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that Time, for it is an evil Time.</HI> Thus, <HI>Holding of ones peace,</HI> that is,
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
using no <HI>Provoking Language</HI> against the <HI>Present Power,</HI> procureth <HI>Holding of ones Peace,</HI> that is, retaining and possessing of one's <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Quiet.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Forbearing</HI> consisteth in <HI>Refraining</HI> (though not without secret sor∣row) <HI>from some Laudable Act</HI> which he heartily desireth, but dares not doe, as visibly destructive to his <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Estate,</HI> being prohibited by the Predominant Powers: In such a Case a man may, to use the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7 26.</NOTE> <HI>Apostle</HI>'s phrase, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>for the present necessity,</HI> omit many things Pleasing to, but not Comman∣ded by that God, who preferreth <HI>Mercy</HI> before <HI>Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>For instance; If any <HI>Earthly Prince</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> should enjoyn a <HI>Christian</HI> (as <HI>Darius</HI> did <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 6.7.</NOTE> <HI>Daniel</HI>) <HI>not to pray to God for the space of Thirty dayes together</HI>; his Command is not to be obeyed, as contrary to Gods positive Precept, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tehss. 5.17.</NOTE> <HI>Pray con∣tinually.</HI> But if he should onely enjoyn him to forbear <HI>such a Form of Prayer,</HI> allowing him liberty to use any other; I conceive that such an omission, Lawful; dictated unto him by the <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Prudence,</HI> for his self-<HI>Preservation.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Active</HI> Part of <HI>Lawful Agreeableness</HI> with the times, is in doing what they enjoyn, as being Indifferent; and sometimes so good, that our own Conscience doth or should enjoyn the same. In such a case, where there is a <HI>Concurrence</HI> of Both together, it is neither <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> nor <HI>Indiscretion,</HI> for one in himself to conceal his own Inclinations, and publickly to put his Actions (as Fasting, Thanksgiving, Preaching, &amp;c.) on the Account of <HI>Conformity to the Times</HI>; it being (as <HI>flattery</HI> to court, so no less) folly to contemne and reject the favour of the Times, when it may be had without the least violation, yet possibly with an Improvement of our own Conscience.</P>
<P>I have Endevoured to steer my Carriage by the <HI>Compass</HI> aforesaid; and my main Motive thereunto was, that I might enjoy the Benefit of my <HI>Ministry,</HI> the bare using whereof, is the greatest <HI>Advancement</HI> I am capable of in this Life. I know all Stars, are not of the same <HI>Bigness</HI> and <HI>Brightness</HI>; some <HI>shine,</HI> some only <HI>twinkle</HI>; and allowing my Self of the latter Size and Sort, I would not willingly put out my own (though dimme) light in total Darkness, nor would bury my <HI>halfe-Talent,</HI> hoping by putting it forth to gain an other <HI>half-Talent</HI> thereby to the Glory of God, and the good of others.</P>
<P>But it will be <HI>Objected</HI> against me, that it is suspicious (at the least) that I have <HI>Bribed the Times,</HI> with some <HI>base Compliance</HI> with them, because they have re∣flected so favourably upon me. Otherwise, how cometh it to pass, that <HI>my fleece,</HI> like <HI>Gideons,</HI> is <HI>dry,</HI> when the rest of my <HI>Brethren</HI> of the <HI>same party,</HI> are <HI>wet</HI> with their own <HI>Tears</HI>; I being permitted <HI>Preaching,</HI> and <HI>peaceable Enjoying</HI> of a <HI>Parsonage.</HI></P>
<P>I answer first, I impute this Peaceableness I enjoy, to Gods undeserved Goodness on my Unworthiness. <HI>He hath not dealt thus with all my Brethren,</HI> above me in <HI>all</HI> respects. God maketh People sometimes, <HI>potius reperire quàm invenire Gratiam, to find the Favours they sought not for.</HI> If I am one of them, whom God <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 106.46.</NOTE> hath made <HI>to be pitied of those who carried me away captive,</HI> I hope, I shall be thankful unto Him; and Others, I hope, will not be Envious at me for so great a Mercy.</P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>Gods Goodness,</HI> I ascribe my Liberty of Preaching, to the <HI>Favour</HI> of some <HI>Great Friends,</HI> God hath raised up for me. It was not a Childish answer, though the answer of a Child to his Father taxing him for being Proud of his New <HI>Coat, I am glad</HI> (said he,) <HI>but not proud of it.</HI> Give me leave to be glad, and joyful in my self, <HI>for my Good Friends</HI>; and to desire, and endevour their Continuance and increase. <HI>A Friend in the Court</HI> hath alwayes been accounted as <HI>Good as a Penny, in the Councel; as a Pound, in the Purse.</HI> Nor will any rational man Condemn me, for making my Addresses to, and improvement of them, seeing the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> himself (as I am informed) hath his <HI>Friend</HI> in the <HI>Councel</HI>; and it is not long since, he had Occasion to make use of his Favour.</P>
<P>I must not forget the <HI>Articles of Exeter,</HI> whereof I had the Benefit, living, and waiting there on the <HI>Kings Daughter</HI> at the <HI>Rendition</HI> thereof. <HI>Articles,</HI> which
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
both as <HI>Penned,</HI> and <HI>Performed</HI> were the best in <HI>England,</HI> thanks to their <HI>Wisdome,</HI> who so <HI>Warily made</HI>; and <HI>Honesty,</HI> who so <HI>well observed</HI> them. Nor was it (though last named) least causal of my Quiet, that (Happy Criticism to my self as I may call it) I never was <HI>formally sequestred,</HI> but <HI>went,</HI> before <HI>driven</HI> away from my Living, which took of the <HI>Edge</HI> off the <HI>Ordinance</HI> against me, that the Waight thereof fell but <HI>slentingly</HI> upon me. Thus when God will fasten a favour on any Person, (though never so unworthy) he ordereth the <HI>Concurrences</HI> of all things <HI>contributive</HI> thereunto.</P>
<P>All I will add is this, that hitherto (and I hope, Who hath, will keep me I speak it in the presence of God) I have not by my <HI>Pen,</HI> or <HI>Practice</HI> to my knowledge done any thing <HI>Unworthily</HI> to the betraying of the Interest of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; and if it can be proved, Let my <HI>Mother-Church not onely spit in my face</HI> (the expression it seems of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Numb. 12.14.</NOTE> Parents amongst the <HI>Iews</HI> when they were offended with their Children for some misdemeanor) but also <HI>spew me out of her mouth.</HI> Some will say, such a Vaunt savoreth of a <HI>Pharisaical</HI> Pride. I utterly deny it. For even the <HI>Publican</HI> after he came from his Confession he had made in the <HI>Temple</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Luk. 18.13.</NOTE> <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</HI> had he met one in the outward Court, accusing and taxing him with such particular Sins, whereof he was guiltless, would no doubt have replied in his own just defence. And seeing I am on my <HI>Purgation,</HI> in what the Schools term <HI>Iustitia Causae</HI> (though not <HI>Personae</HI>) I cannot say less, (as I will no more) in my <HI>Iustification.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I represented the <HI>Reader</HI> with the <HI>True Complexion</HI> of my <HI>Cause,</HI> and though I have not painted the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace</HI> thereof with <HI>false Colours,</HI> I hope I have washed from it the <HI>foul Aspersion</HI> of <HI>Temporizing</HI> or <HI>sinful Agreeableness with the Times,</HI> which the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> causlesly casts upon it.</P>
<P>So much for my <HI>Outward Carriage</HI> in reference to the <HI>Times</HI>; Mean time what the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of my <HI>Heart</HI> have been thereof. I am not bound to make a Discovery to my Own Danger. Sure I am, such who <HI>are</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 20.19.</NOTE> <HI>Peaceable</HI> and <HI>Faithful in Israel,</HI> may nevertheless be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Esaiah 61.3.</NOTE> <HI>Mourners in Zion,</HI> and greive at what they cannot mend, but must endure. This also I know that, That <HI>Spoak</HI> in the <HI>Wheel</HI> which <HI>Creeketh most,</HI> doth not <HI>bear</HI> the <HI>Greatest burden</HI> in the Cart. The <HI>Greatest complainers</HI> are not alwayes the <HI>Greatest Sufferers,</HI> whilst as much yea more sincere sorrow may be managed in Secret Silence, than with Querulous, and Clamorous Obstreporous∣ness; and such, who will neither <HI>print</HI> nor <HI>preach Satyrs</HI> on the <HI>Times,</HI> may make <HI>Elegies</HI> on them in their own Soules.</P>

<P>He hath done me more—right, than he was aware of, or was willing to do: for those indeed were the <HI>three principal Motives</HI> of my weak Endea∣vours in my Church-History.

<P>The words of <HI>St. Paul</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.8. <HI>Non possumus aliquid adversus veritatem sed pro veritate, We can do nothing against the Truth but for the Truth</HI>; well fitted the mouth of the Apostle, divinely inspired in his writings, only to be a <HI>Cham∣pion</HI> for the <HI>Truth.</HI> In one sense I allow them also applicable to the Animad∣vertor, according to the received Rule <HI>Illud possumus, quod jure possumus, We can do that which we can lawfully do</HI> —.

<P>All that I will add is this, that although the Doctor be pleased to call his notes <HI>Necessary Animadversions,</HI> (who can blame the loving Father for giving his own dear Babe a good name) yet upon serious examination it will appear that <HI>some</HI> of these <HI>Animadversions,</HI> ought to have been omitted, for the promoting of Piety; and <HI>many</HI> of them might have been omitted, without any prejudice to the Truth: as in due time and place, God willing, shall be observed.</P>

<P><HI>A General</HI> PREFACE TO THE WHOLE.</P>
<P>It is affirmed of History by the famous Orator, that it is <HI>Testis Temporum,</HI> the Witness and Record of Time, by which the Actions of it are transmitted from one Age to another. And therefore it concerns all those who apply themselves to the writing of Histories to take speciall care, that all things be laid down exactly, faithfully, and without Deviation from the Truth in the least particular; For if the Witnesses be suborned, the Record falsified, or the Evidence wrested, neither posterity can Judge rightly of the Actions of this present time; or this time, give a certain Judgement of the Ages past.</P>

<P>Allthough Mr. <HI>Sanderson</HI> is equally concerned with my Self in this Generall Preface, yet because I am beheld as the <HI>principal malefactor,</HI> I have here pre∣sented it intire.

<P>It is therefore a good direction which <HI>Iosephus</HI> the Historian gives us, and which he followed as it seems in his <HI>Iewish Antiquities,</HI> not only to be care∣full that the Stile be pleasing, but that the whole work be framed by the level and line of Truth, <HI>Nam qui Historiam &amp; rerum propter Antiquitatem ob∣scurarum expositionem, &amp;c.</HI>
<Q>They (saith he) who make profession to write Histories, and to recite such things as are obscured by Antiquitie, ought not only studiously to conform their stile, but also to beautyfie the same with ornaments of Eloq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, to the intent the Reader may converse in their Wri∣tings with the more delectation.

<P>I acknowledge that this is the Character of a Complete <HI>Historian,</HI> to which all in their Writings ought to aspire with their best endeavours; though I believe none ever attained to the height thereof.</P>

<P>But on the contrary, there are some who do spend themselves on the style and dresse, as if their business rather were to delight the ear then inform the judge∣ment; Others so byassed by self-ends and private interesse, that they seem ra∣ther Advocates to plead for some growing party, then true Reporters of affairs as they be before them. Some who endevouring to be copious, clap all together in a huddle which is offered to them, without relation to the Ornaments and Attire of Language; and others with like carelesness as unto themselves, but greater inconvenience as unto the Reader, examine not the truth and certainty of what they write, so they write somewhat which they think may inform the Reader. Betwixt these, Truth is oftentimes irrecoverably lost, the Reader led aside from the wayes of Verity into the crooked lanes of Error; and many times conducted to such dangerous <HI>precipices</HI> as may prove destructive to himself, and of ill conse∣quence to all those which are guided by him. The Errors of the Understanding, in matters which may possibly be reduced to Practise, are far more mischievous then those which do consist in the niceties of Speculation, and advance no far∣ther; which moved the Orator, not onely to honour <HI>History</HI> with the Attribute of <HI>Testis Temporum,</HI> but to style it also by the name of <HI>Magistra Vitae.</HI></P>

<P>I remember when the reverend Vice-master of <HI>Trinity</HI> College in <HI>Cambridge</HI> was told that one of the Scholars had abused him in an <HI>Oration. Did he</HI> (said he) <HI>name me? Did he name</HI> Thomas Harrison? And when it was returned, <HI>that he named him not</HI>; then said he, <HI>I do not believe that he meant me.</HI> Although it is very suspicious that I am the mark aimed at in this discourse; yet being not conscious of such faults to my self, and because I am not named by him, I will not understand my self intended, till he toucheth me with more personal par∣ticularities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>These things considered as they ought, hath made me wonder many times at the unadvisedness of some late Writers in this kind, whose Histories are com∣posed with so much partiality on the one Side, and so much inadvertency on the Other; that they stand more in need of a <HI>Commentator</HI> to expound the Truth, and lay it clear and open to the view of the Reader, than either the dark words of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> or any other obscure Piece of the ancient Writers. I speak of <HI>Histories,</HI> not <HI>Libels</HI>; of which last sort, I reckon <HI>Weldon</HI>'s Pamphlet, called <HI>The Court of King Iames</HI>; and <HI>Wilson</HI>'s most infamous <HI>Pasquil</HI> of the Reign of that King: in which it is not easie to judge, whether the Matter be more false, or the Stile more reproachful in all parts thereof. Certain I am, we may affirm of them as <HI>Cremutius Cordus</HI> doth of the <HI>Epistles</HI> of <HI>Antonius,</HI> and the <HI>Orations</HI> of <HI>Brutus, Falsa quidem in Augustum probra, sed multa cum acerbitate habent</HI>; that is to say, that they contained not only false and disgraceful passages against the honour of <HI>Augustus,</HI> but were apparelled also in the habit of scurrilous language. With such as these I shall not meddle at the present, leaving their crimes unto the punishment not of an <HI>Index,</HI> but an <HI>Ignis Expurgatorius,</HI> as most proper for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not concerned at all in this Paragraph; Onely let me add this in the honour of the deceased <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who told me at <HI>Beddington,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
that when <HI>Wilson</HI>'s Book in <HI>Manuscript</HI> was brought unto him, he expunged out of it more than an hundred <HI>offensive</HI> passages. <HI>My Lord,</HI> said I) <HI>you have done well, and you had done better if you had put out one hundred more.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But as for those whom either the want of true intelligence or inadvertency in not weighing seriously what they were to do, or the too much indulgence to their own affections have made more capable of being bettered by correction, I have thought it more agreeable to the Rules of justice, to rectifie their mistakes, and reform their Errors, than absolutely to condemn and decry their Writings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>REFORMING</HI> of <HI>Errors</HI> is a specious and glorious Designe, especially when proportionable means are used in order thereunto. But of late the word <HI>RE∣FORMATION</HI> is grown so <HI>thredbare,</HI> it hath no <HI>nap</HI> left it, thereunder to cover <HI>foul acts</HI> to attain a <HI>fair end.</HI> I much suspect the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> will prove such a <HI>Deforming-Reformer,</HI> as our Age hath produced too many of them.</P>

<P>At this time I have Two before me whom I conceive to stand in need of such Observations, by which the truth may be preserved, and the clear face of things presented to the Readers eye; the one of them an Authour of <HI>Eccle∣siastical,</HI> the other of some <HI>Civil</HI> Histories.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I commend the valour of the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> to combate with <HI>Two at once</HI>; odds, on which <HI>Hercules</HI> himself durst not adventure. I also am to deal with two, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> and Dr. <HI>Cosins,</HI> but not as a <HI>Challenger,</HI> but in the notion of a poor <HI>Defendant</HI>; and if one be assaulted by <HI>two hundred,</HI> he may and must guard himself against them as well as he can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In both I find the Truth much injured, and in one the Church. The Errors of the one tend not to the subversion of any publick interesse, but, being Errors, may misguide the Reader in the way of his knowledge and discourse; and therefore I have rectified him with some Advertisements (not taking notice of such passages as have been made the subject of some <HI>Observations</HI> from another hand) that so he may be read with the greatest profit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is meant of Mr. <HI>Sanderson.</HI> I am not so divellishly minded as to desire all men might be equally faulty with my self, that so being involved with others in a joynt-Guiltiness of the same degree, I might on that account pretend to a <HI>mock-Innocence.</HI> If Mr. <HI>Sanderson</HI>'s Pen be less peccant than mine, I congratu∣late his condition, and provide to answer to my owne Charge, which followeth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr: <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The other (besides Errors of this kind too many) hath intermingled his Discourse with some Positions of a dangerous nature; which being reduced into practise, as they easily may, not only overthrow the whole power of the Church,
<PB N="20" REF="13" MS="y"/>
as it stands constituted and established by the Laws of the Land, but lay a probable foundation for the like disturbances in the Civil State.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Common custome hath oversway'd the word <HI>Antidote</HI> to signifie a <HI>Defensative</HI> against, or <HI>expulsative</HI> of, <HI>Poyson</HI>; However, the bare notation of the word advanceth no further than to import something <HI>given against</HI>: in which sense none of our Nation hath been so free of his <HI>Antidotes</HI> as the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>; having <HI>given them against</HI> Mr. <HI>Calvin, Archbishop Williams, Archbishop Usher, Dr. Hackwell, Dr. Prideaux, Dr. Barnard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Le-strange,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sanderson, and my un∣worthy Self,</HI> no shame to follow in the <HI>Reere</HI> after such a <HI>Van</HI> and <HI>Main-battel.</HI></P>
<P>Sure I am, his pretended <HI>Antidote</HI> on my <HI>Book,</HI> hath more of <HI>Poyson</HI> than <HI>Cordial</HI> therein, envenoming many plain and true passages, sound and solid sentences,, with his false Glosses, forced Inferences, and pestilent Applications.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know well, how Invidious a Task I have undertaken and that it will be charged upon me at the first apprehensions of it, that I have rather chosen to find fault with the writings of others, than to write any things of this kind, which may be subject to the like partialities, and mistakings. <HI>Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua,</HI> might come in seasonably here, if I had not somewhat to alledge for my Justification; But when the Reasons which induced me to the first Adventure (mentioned in the Introduction following) be seriously considered, as they ought to be, I hope I shall be capable of excuse, if not of pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath here raised up (I assure you) a <HI>Strong Spirit</HI> against himself, and whether the <HI>Spells,</HI> here used by him, be able to conjure it down again, others must decide it; mean time, fight <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> fight <HI>Objection</HI> of his own making, seeing I have neither Skill, nor Will, to interpose to part them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And for my venturing on the other, I shall say nothing more at the pre∣sent, but that as well my love to Truth, as to do right unto the Author (whom I would willingly look on as a man well principled, and of no ill affectio∣ons to Church or State) hath invited me to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here my credit is more deeply wounded by the <HI>glance</HI> of a <HI>bullet,</HI> than if it were <HI>directly</HI> shot against me; For whereas he saith, that he <HI>would willingly look on Mr. Sanderson as a man well principled, and of no ill affections to Church,
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
or State,</HI> he concludes me by plain intimation disaffected to both; But I hope that those who are <HI>cleer-sighted, look</HI> on me under a better notion.</P>

<P>Truth is the Mistris which I serve.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I presume that none will be offended with me, because I tell them of their Errors in a <HI>modest way,</HI> and bear witness for them to that Truth, of which they do profess themselves such especiall lovers. In that great <HI>Disputation</HI> betwixt the <HI>Esquires</HI> of the Body of King <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Esdr. 4.41.</NOTE> <HI>Darius,</HI> whether the King, Women, or the Truth, were of greatest Power, the whole Assembly cried out in the behalfe of <HI>Truth, Magna est veritas &amp; praevalet,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Great is Truth, and mighty above all things.</HI></P>

<P>I acknowledge this a <HI>Canonical Truth,</HI> though written in the Apocrypha. It will soon be seen, who will shout most at the Triumphs of Truth, I or the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> corrivall with me to the same <HI>Mistris.</HI></P>

<P>Here he soareth so high a flight I cannot follow him; yea, I suspect, that in <HI>reaching</HI> so high a <HI>Note</HI> he hath <HI>strained</HI> (if not <HI>broken</HI>) his <HI>voice.</HI> What, no reflexion on a <HI>Reward</HI>?

<P>If not (for I am at a reasonable pass for that) it shall be no small comfort to me, that the weak Candle of my Studyes hath given light to others, whereby they may discern some Historical Truths even in the darkest mists of Error, which either Partiality or Incogitance hath cast before the eyes of many Readers.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reader in due time will Judge, whether his <HI>Candle</HI> hath by the <HI>light</HI>

<P>Which said, I shall now add no more, but that having two Patients under cure of different tempers, it is not to be thought, that I should administer unto both the same kind of Physick, an ordinary purge being sufficient for the one, where∣as the foul body of the other doth require a <HI>Fluxing</HI>; as some wounds may be healed with Balm, when others more corrupt and putrified do exact a <HI>Lancing.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which said, I shall now add no more but that having two Adversaries, Dr. <HI>Heylyn,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Cosens</HI> to encounter, it is not to be thought, that I should pro∣ceed against both alike; Dr. <HI>Cosens</HI> hath merited much of the <HI>Protestant Cause</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and thereby commands my Pen to pay the <HI>Homage</HI> of due reverence to the <HI>Crown</HI> of his old <HI>Age,</HI> especially when found <HI>in the way of Truth.</HI> But I am not under any such Obligation of particular respect to Dr <HI>Heylyn</HI> on the same account.</P>
<P>I could wish he had used a more cleanly <HI>Metaphor,</HI> and forborn the phrase of <HI>Fluxing.</HI> Such a cure appears not in <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> as being a modern <HI>remedy,</HI> for a modern <HI>malady.</HI> However, would I were but half so holy as he was, of whom it was said, <HI>An evill disease</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Psal. 41.8.</NOTE> <HI>say they</HI> (and they did but say it) <HI>cleaveth fast unto him.</HI></P>
<P>I will use no harsher <HI>Metaphor</HI> in relation of my answers to my two <HI>Antagonists,</HI> than only, That <HI>men</HI> may meddle with a <HI>Mallow</HI> with <HI>naked</HI> hands, but need to put on their <HI>Hedging</HI>-gloves when to deal with a <HI>Thorn</HI> or <HI>Nettle.</HI></P>
<P>Onely here I shall presume to request the Reader, to take especial notice of those remarkable words of the Animadvertor [<HI>tell them of their Errors in a MODEST WAY</HI>] and keep them against a <HI>rainy-day,</HI> I mean such a seasonable Time as we may make use thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But so it happeneth many times, that some men are more impatient of the Cure, then sensible of their Diseases; and that, in stead of giving thanks to to the Physitian, for the great pains he took about them, they pay him with nothing but displeasures. Which being the worst that can befall me, I am armed against it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>But so it happeneth many times, that (as in this case) there may be <HI>plus periculi à Medico quàm à Morbo, More danger of the Physitian than of the Disease</HI>; A good <HI>belief</HI> and conceit of the <HI>Physitian,</HI> is more than <HI>half a Cure</HI>: and I con∣fess I have none of the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> whom I behold but as an adventurous <HI>Emperick,</HI> having seen and marked his practise on other <HI>Patients,</HI> rather disgrace∣ing their Persons than amending their Errors: Give me a <HI>Physitian</HI> of my own <HI>Election,</HI> not of his <HI>Intrusion</HI>; especially when he usually wrappeth up his best <HI>Receipts</HI> in <HI>Poysoned Papers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If by the hazard of my Peace I shall procure this benefit to the present and succeeding times, that men may prove more careful of what they write, and
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
not obtrude upon the Reader (either through Ignorance, inadvertency, or somewhat worse) such and so many falsities, mistakes, and errors, as have been lately put upon him in some modern Histories; It is that I aimed at, and having gained that point, I have gained my purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if on the contrary (which is more probable) it commeth to pass, that some having commendable Inclinations, and proportionable Qualifications to write Histories, perceiving their Books, <HI>Damnatos antequam natos, baned</HI> before <HI>born,</HI> by the prejudice which this Animadvertor bears their <HI>Parents</HI>; who is ready as soon as their Books shall peep out of the Press, to assault them with causless cavills: What I say if such persons on the tender resentment of the premises shall quit all their Intentions to write; the Animadvertor can little com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort himself, and others will less commend him, for this his over-activity, so destru∣ctive to the publick Good. But there are some, who when they can no longer bewitch with their <HI>Beauty,</HI> endevour to doe it with their <HI>Malice,</HI> thereby to render themselves in any sort considerable; to be feared, when they are no more loved. All I will add is this, He who already having <HI>one</HI> of his <HI>feet in the Grave,</HI> will <HI>spurn</HI> his brother with the <HI>other</HI>; will find few to pitty him, if <HI>falling all a∣long</HI> for his pains.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>INtending some short Animadversions on the <HI>Church-History of Brittain,</HI> for Vindication of the Truth, the Church, and the injured Clergy, I have thought good to prepare the way unto them by a plain, but <HI>necessary Introduction,</HI> touching the Quality and Nature of the Book which I have in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Intending, God willing, to return a true, clear, and short Answer to the <HI>Introducti∣on,</HI> I conceived it requisite to premise these few lines following.</P>
<P>The Animadvertor like a Cunning <HI>Market-man,</HI> hath put his best <HI>Corn</HI> in the <HI>top</HI> of his <HI>Sack</HI> to invite <HI>Chapmen</HI> to <HI>buy</HI> it. His Preface hath a <HI>Decoction</HI> of his whole Book, which was advisedly done by him, hoping that those might read his <HI>Preface</HI> whom he suspected would never <HI>peruse</HI> his <HI>Book.</HI></P>
<P>Reader, As I am loath, any thing in his Book should not be <HI>once</HI> Answered, so be not offended, if to avoid repetition, I am loath it should be <HI>twice</HI> answered. Each particular in the Preface will recurre in the body of the Book, where (by Gods assistance) no emphatical word nor syllable shall pass without its respective reply.</P>
<P>Nor hath the Reader any cause to suspect, that by such shifting I intend any Evasion, by pleading in the <HI>Preface,</HI> that I will answer objections in the <HI>Body of my Book,</HI> and alledging in the Body of my Book, that I have answered them in the <HI>Preface.</HI> For I have to do with the Animadvertor, so cunning and so exacting a Merchant, that it is impossible for one indebted unto him, to escape without full <HI>payment,</HI> by changing the place of his habitation.</P>
<P>However the Animadvertor hath dealt severely (to say no worse) with me, who, to render me the more culpable, and my Book of the less credit, hath re∣presented all my faults in a <HI>Duplicating Glass</HI>; And whereas the <HI>Best of Beings, non bis judicat in id ipsum, doth not punish the same faults twice,</HI> he hath twice taxed every supposed mistake in my History, once in his Preface, and again, in the Body of his Book.</P>

<P>My words are by the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> given-in <HI>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectively,</HI> and (as to me) <HI>disad∣vantageously</HI>; this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assage</HI> (which ought to have been inserted) immediatly pre∣ceding my Promise.</P>
<P><HI>If I may be so happy as to see these gloomy dayes disclouded with the beams of Gods mercy.</HI></P>
<P>I appeal to the Conscience of the Animadvertor himself, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther in his Soul he conceiveth these days <HI>disclouded</HI> or no. <HI>Gloomy</HI> they were when I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote those words, before any war <HI>rained</HI> in the Land; and since such bloody showers have ended, they continue louring, gloomy, and dark unto this day.</P>
<P>My promise therfore being thus but Conditional, and the condition on which it was grounded not as yet performed, I have no ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Liberare fidem,</HI> to <HI>free my Faith,</HI> which was never bound, though I had ever since utterly quitted all thoughts of writing any Church-History.</P>
<P>For, the first <HI>five years,</HI> during our <HI>actual Civill Wars,</HI> I had little list or leasure to write; fearing to be made an <HI>History,</HI> and shifting daily for my safety. All that time I could not <HI>live to study,</HI> who did onely <HI>study to live.</HI></P>
<P>So soon as Gods goodness gave me a fixed habitation, I composed my Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> or <HI>Pisgah</HI>-Sight. This, though I confess it be no part of <HI>Church-Building,</HI> yet it is the clearing of <HI>the floore</HI> or <HI>Foundation</HI> thereof, by presenting the performances of Christ and his Apostles in Palestine. I perceive the <HI>Anim∣advertor</HI> hath <HI>a months mind</HI> to give me a Jeere, for my fallying into the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> which I can bear the better, seeing (by Gods goodness) that my Book hath met with generall reception, likely to <HI>live</HI> when I am <HI>dead</HI>; so that friends of quality solicite me, to teach it the <HI>Latine-Language.</HI></P>

<P>For first, the Reader might expect by the former passage, that he designed the <HI>Generall History</HI> of the Church, from the first preaching of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the calling of the twelve <HI>Apostles</HI> to the times we live in: whereas he hath restrained himself to the Church of <HI>Brittain,</HI> which he conceives to be so far from being founded in the time of <HI>Christ,</HI> that he is loth to give it the Antiquity of being the work of any of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> of any of the <HI>Seventy Disciples,</HI> or finally of any <HI>Apostolicall</HI> Spirit of those eldest times.</P>

<P><HI>Charity begins, but doth not end, at home.</HI> The same Method was embraced in my <HI>Church-History.</HI> It began with our own <HI>Domestick affairs,</HI> to confute that accusation, commonly charged on <HI>Englishmen,</HI> that they are very knowing in for∣rain parts, but ignorant in their own Country. I intended (God willing) to have proceeded to forrain Churches, but I am discouraged by the causless cavil∣ing at what I have written already.</P>
<P>My Church-History beginneth (for point of Time) <HI>Indeterminately</HI> before the <HI>Birth of Christ,</HI> (<HI>lapping</HI> in, or <HI>folding</HI> over part of Paganisme) and presenteth the dolefull condition of the <HI>Britons,</HI> whilest yet unconverted, and grievious Idolaters.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="16" MS="y"/><HI>Determinately,</HI> my History begins Anno Dom. 37. which is but four years after <HI>Christs</HI> Passion, and that is very early, I assure you: Christianity in this Island, being a <HI>Timely riser,</HI> to be <HI>up so soon,</HI> and <HI>dressing it Self,</HI> whilest as yet (and many years after) most Countreys were <HI>fast asleep</HI> in <HI>Pugan Impiety,</HI></P>
<P>I deny not but that Apostolical men, were the first founders of Religion in our Land. But as for such Apostles, (St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>Paul, &amp;c.</HI>) who without probability of Truth, and against proportion of Time, are by some Authors obtruded on us, those I do reject, (I hope, without the least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ault) rendring my reasons for the same.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And secondly, Though he entitle it by the name of the <HI>Church-History of Brittain,</HI> yet he pursues not his Design agreeable to that Title neither: there being little said of the affairs of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which certainly makes up a considerable part of the Isle of <HI>Brittain</HI>; and less (if any thing at all) of the Church of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which anciently past in the account of a <HI>Brittish-Island.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will render the Reader a true account, why I entitled my Book, The <HI>Church-History of Brittain.</HI></P>
<P>First, the <HI>Church-History of England</HI> I might not call it, the <HI>five first Centu∣ries</HI> therein belonging wholly to the <HI>Brittains</HI> before the Name and Notion of <HI>England,</HI> was ever heard of in any Author.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Church-History of Great-Brittain,</HI> I did not call it; for fear of bringing in <HI>Scotland</HI> within the Latitude thereof, a compass too large for my weak Endeavours.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>Church-History of Brittain,</HI> I did, and might call it, in a double respect, <HI>tam à parte Majore, quàm meliore,</HI> both from the <HI>bigger</HI> and <HI>better,</HI> the <HI>fairer</HI> and <HI>fruitfuller</HI> part of <HI>Brittain,</HI> the Ecclesiastical affairs whereof were there∣in contained.</P>
<P>Yea the Animadvertor knows full well, that the South of this Island, <HI>by way of Eminence</HI> is so called: To give one Instance of many, from the Title-page, of a passage of State.
<Q>Nobilissima disceptatio super Dignitate &amp; magnitudine Regnorum Britannici Et Gallici, habita ab utriusque Oratoribus &amp; Legatis, in Concilio Constantiensi; Lovanii, anno <HI>1517.</HI> Typis excusa.</Q></P>
<P><HI>The most noble Dispute, about the Dignity and greatness</HI> of the Kingdomes of <HI>Brittain</HI> and <HI>France, betwixt the Embassadors and Legates of both Sides, in the Councell of Constance; Anno</HI> 1517. <HI>printed at Lovaine.</HI></P>
<P>Here the contest only was betwixt the Crowns of <HI>England</HI> [here termed <HI>Brittain</HI>] and <HI>France, Scotland</HI> not at all interesting it self therein.</P>
<P>It will not be long before the Animadvertor (as, God willing, in due time shall be observed) stickleth with <HI>might</HI> and <HI>main,</HI> that <HI>Lucius</HI> might properly style himself, and be styled <HI>King of Brittain,</HI> who had not an <HI>half</HI> of the <HI>Southern-half</HI> of this Island: and therefore, by his own Principles, it is no Solecisme in me, to name the <HI>cis-Tweedan Moity</HI> thereof, <HI>Brittain.</HI></P>
<P>Had I given my native Countrey a <HI>narrow</HI> and <HI>restrictive</HI> name, I had deserved due reproof; but now, measuring the <HI>denomination</HI> thereof, with all <HI>honourable advantage,</HI> I humbly conceive my self not to fall under just reprehension for the same.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor is it, thirdly, a <HI>Church-History</HI> rightly and properly so called, but an aggregation of such and so many <HI>Heterogeneous</HI> bodies, that <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> affairs make the least part of it. Abstracted from the dresse and trimming, and all those outward imbelishments which appear upon it, it hath a very fit resem∣blance to that <HI>Lady of pleasure</HI> of which <HI>Martial</HI> tells us, <HI>Pars minima est ipsa puella sui,</HI> that the woman was the least part of her self. The name of a <HI>Church-Rhapsody</HI> had been fitter for it, though to say truth (had it been answerable thereunto in point of learning) it might have past by the old Title of <HI>Fuller's Miscellanies.</HI> For such and so many are the impertinencies, as to matters of <HI>Histo∣ricall</HI> nature, more as to matters of the Church, that without them this great Volume had been brought to a narrower compass, if it had taken up any room at all. So that we may affirm of the present History, as one did of the Wri∣tings of <HI>Chrysippus</HI> an old Philosopher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diog. Laert. in vita Chry∣sippi.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Si quis tollat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>è Chrysippi Libris quae aliena sunt, facilè illi vacua relinquerentur Pergamena,</HI> that is to say, that if they were well purged of all such passages as were not pertinent to the business which he had in hand, there would be nothing left in them to fill up his Parchments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath a free liberty to name His own <HI>Books</HI>; and I crave the same leave <HI>my self,</HI> to denominate My own.</P>
<P>Before he had fallen so fiercely on my extravagancies in the <HI>Church-Historie,</HI> he had done well to have defended <HI>his own,</HI> in his <HI>Geographie; sixteen</HI> parts of <HI>twenty</HI> therein being meerly <HI>Historicall,</HI> and <HI>aliene</HI> from his Subject in the strictness there∣of. Sure I am, <HI>Ptolomey, Strabo, Pliny</HI> &amp;c. in their severall descriptions of the world, have nothing to countenance the excursions about the Pedegrees of Princes, not <HI>reductive</HI> to <HI>Geographie</HI> without the great favor of the <HI>Reader</HI> so to understand it.</P>
<P>But because <HI>Recrimination</HI> is no part of <HI>Purgation,</HI> I provide my self to answer to all which shall be objected for impertinencies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The first of this kind which I am to note, is a meer <HI>extrinsecall</HI> and outside unto those impertinencies which are coucht within; consisting of <HI>Title-Pages, Dedicatory-Epistles,</HI> and severall intermediate <HI>Inscriptions</HI> unto every Section. A new way, never travelled before by any, till he found it out; and such where∣in he is not like to find many followers, though the way be opened. I know it is no unusuall thing for works of different Arguments, publisht at severall times, and dedicated to severall persons, to be drawn together into one Volume; and being so drawn together, to retain still those particular <HI>Titles</HI> and <HI>Dedicati∣ons</HI> which at first they had. But I dare confidently say, that our Historian is the first, who writing a Book of the same Argument, not published by peece-meal, as it came from his hand, but in a full and intire Volume, hath filled his Sheets with so many <HI>Title-leaves</HI> and <HI>Dedications,</HI> as we have before us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answer first, Although it be unlawfull even for the owner himself <HI>abuti re sua, to abuse</HI> what is his own, because the <HI>Publick</HI> hath an interest therein; Yet, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Math. 5.10.</NOTE> <HI>Is it not lawfull for me to Do, what I will with my Own?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, seeing the Animadvertor pretendeth in his notes to rectifie <HI>Mistakes, Falsities,</HI> and <HI>Defects,</HI> this cometh not under any of these notions. And whereas he writeth (as he saith) for the Vindication of the <HI>Truth, Church,</HI> and <HI>injured-Clergy</HI>;
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>
by my dedicating of my Book to many Patrons, the Truth is not prejudiced, nor the <HI>Church wronged,</HI> nor any of the <HI>Clergy injured.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Of late some <HI>usefull</HI> and <HI>costly</HI> Books, when past their Parents power <HI>to bring them forth,</HI> have been <HI>delivered</HI> to the Publick, by the <HI>Midwifery</HI> of such Dedications.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Many (if not most) of my <HI>Patrons</HI> invited themselves purposely to encourage my endevours; And why should <HI>any mans eye be evil,</HI> because theirs were <HI>good unto me.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, It is all one in effect, whether one printeth his Dedications to many <HI>Pa∣trons,</HI> or whether one presenteth a printed <HI>History of St▪ George, to each English Knight of the Garter,</HI> with a written <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch I have seen under the hand of the Animad∣ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> letter prefixed to every one of them: save that the former way is better, as which rendereth the Authors gratitude the more publick and conspicuous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For in this one Book, taking in the History of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> which is but an Appendix to it, there are no fewer than twelve particular Titles, besides the generall; as many particular Dedications; and no fewer then fifty eight or sixty of those By-Inscriptions, which are addrest to his particular Friends and Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctors, which make it bigger by forty Sheets at the least, then it had been otherwise. Nay, so ambitious he is of increasing the Number of his Patrons, that having but four Leaves to come to the end of his History, he finds out a particular <HI>Benefactress</HI> to inscribe it to: Which brings to my minde the vanity of <HI>Vitellius</HI> in bestowing, and of <HI>Roscius, Regulus</HI> for accepting the Consular Dignity, for that part of the day on which <HI>Cecinna,</HI> by Order and Decree of the Senate, was degraded from it: Of which the Historian gives this Note, that it was, <HI>Magno cum irrisu accipientis tribuentisque,</HI> a matter of no mean dis∣port amongst the People for a long time after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ordinary Dedications exceed not a dozen lines, and therefore I believe the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> is much mistaken in his proportions.</P>
<P>If I did Dedicate <HI>four leaves</HI> to a <HI>distinct Patroness,</HI> no such fault therein; seeing, I am confident, those four leaves contain in them so <HI>remarkable</HI> an <HI>Accident,</HI> as the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> never read the like in four thousand leaves of any <HI>Historian.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But of this Argument our Author heard so much at the late Act at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that I shall say no more of it at this present time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard nothing thereof at <HI>Oxford,</HI> being then sixty miles distanced thence. Sure I am, I did not there <HI>Malè audire</HI> deservedly; and if undeservedly, <HI>mala fama bene parta delectat.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I have heard since, that <HI>one</HI> in the Act, was bold to play on my own name <HI>and Church-History.</HI> But for the seventeen years I lived in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> I never heard any Prevaricator mention his <HI>Senior by name</HI>: We count such <HI>particularizing</HI> beneath an <HI>University.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, I hope it will not be accounted <HI>Pride,</HI> but Prudence in me, to believe my self above such Trifles, who have written <HI>a Book to Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, I regreat not to be <HI>Anvile,</HI> for any ingenious <HI>Hammer</HI> to make pleasant musick on; but it seems my Traducer was not so happy.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="17"/>Lastly, I remember a speech o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sir <HI>Walter Rawleighs, If any</HI> (saith he) <HI>speaketh against me to my face, my Tongue shall give him an Answer; but my back-side is good enough to return to him, who abuseth me behind my back.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the next ranck of Impertinencies, which are more <HI>intrinseall,</HI> part of the substance of the work, I account his <HI>Heraldry, Blazons</HI> of Arms, <HI>Descents</HI> of noble Families with their Atchivements intermingled as they come in his way; not pertinent, I am sure, to a <HI>Church-Historian,</HI> unless such persons had been Founders of <HI>Episcopal Sees,</HI> or <HI>Religious-Houses,</HI> or that the Arms so <HI>blazoned</HI> did belong to either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answer in generall, Those passages of <HI>Heraldry</HI> are put in for <HI>variety</HI> and <HI>diversion,</HI> to refresh the wearied Reader.</P>
<P>They are never used without <HI>asking of leave</HI> before, or craving pardon after the inserting thereof; and such <HI>craving</HI> is <HI>having</HI> a request in that kind with the Ingenious. Grant it ill manners in the Author not to ask, <HI>it is ill nature</HI> in the Reader not to grant so small a suit.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> in his description of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> hath a <HI>prolixe</HI> (though not <HI>tedious</HI>) <HI>poeme,</HI> of the marriage of <HI>Thame</HI> and <HI>Isis,</HI> which he ushereth in with <HI>Si placet, vel legas vel negligas, read</HI> or <HI>reject,</HI> either <HI>set by it,</HI> or <HI>set it by</HI>; as the Reader is disposed.</P>
<P>The same, (though not expressed) is implied in all such Digressions, which may be said to be left <HI>unprinted in Effect,</HI> to such as like them not: their <HI>Ploughs</HI> may make <HI>Balks</HI> of such <HI>deviations,</HI> and proceed to more serious matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our Author tells us, <HI>lib.</HI> 9. <HI>fol.</HI> 151. that knowledge in the Laws of this Land, <HI>is neither to be expected or required in one of</HI> his <HI>profession</HI>; and yet, I trow, considering the great influence which the Laws have upon Church-matters, the knowledge of the Law cannot be so unnecessary in the way of a Clergy-man, as the study of <HI>Heraldry</HI>: But granting <HI>Heraldry</HI> to be an Ornament in all them that have it, yet is it no ingredient requisit to the composition of an <HI>Ecclesiasti∣cal History: The Copies of Battle-Abbey Roll</HI> fitter for <HI>Stow</HI> and <HI>Hollinshead,</HI> (where before we had them) can, in an History of the Church, pretend to no place at all, though possibly the names of some may be remembred, as their Foundations or Endowments of Churches give occasion for it. The Arms of <HI>Knight-Errant,</HI> billeted in the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> by the <HI>Norman</HI> Conqueror, is of like extravagancy. Such also is the Catalogue of those noble Adventurers, (with their Arms, Issue and Atchievements) who did accompany King <HI>Richard</HI> the first to the War of <HI>Palestine,</HI> which might have better serv'd as an Appendix to his History of the <HI>Holy War,</HI> then found a place in the main Body of an History of the <HI>Church of England</HI>: Which three alone, besides many <HI>intercalations</HI> of that kind, in most parts of the Book, make up eight sheets more, inserted onely for the ostentation of his skill in <HI>Heraldry,</HI> in which notwithstanding he hath fallen on as palpable Errors as he hath committed in his History:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> in his <HI>Acts and Monuments</HI> hath done the like, presenting the names of such who came over at the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest. I have only made their <HI>Catalogue</HI> more complete. And seeing it was preserved in <HI>Battle-Abbey,</HI> the very <HI>addition</HI> of <HI>Abbey</HI> doth <HI>dye</HI> it with some <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> tincture.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="18"/>The Arms of the Knights of <HI>Ely,</HI> might on a threefold title have escaped the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s censure: First, they was never before printed. Secondly, the Wall whereon they were depicted, is now demolished. Lastly, each <HI>Knight</HI> being <HI>blended</HI> (or, as I may say, <HI>empaled</HI>) with a <HI>Monk,</HI> a <HI>Moiety</HI> of that Mixture may be construed reducible to <HI>Church-History.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Arms of some signal persons atchieved in the <HI>HOLY-WAR</HI>; If the Sirname of <HI>WAR</HI> be <HI>secular,</HI> the Christian name thereof, <HI>HOLY,</HI> is <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI>; and so rendred all actions therein within the <HI>latitude</HI> of <HI>Church-History,</HI> to an inge∣nuous Reader.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For, besides those which are observed in the course of this work, I find two others of that kind in his History of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to be noted there.</P>
<P>For <HI>fol.</HI> 146. he telleth us, That <HI>Alice Countess of Oxford was Daughter and sole Heir of</HI> Gilbert <HI>Lord</HI> Samford, <HI>which</HI> Gilbert <HI>was Hereditary Lord Chamberlain of England</HI>]. But, by his leave, <HI>Gilbert</HI> Lord <HI>Samford</HI> was never the hereditary Chamberlain of the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> but only Chamberlain in Fee to the Queens of <HI>England</HI>; betwixt which Offices how vast a difference there is, let our Au∣thour judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I plead in my own defence (according to my <HI>last general Answer</HI>) that I have charged my <HI>Margin</HI> with my Autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And secondly, The Honor of Lord Chamberlain of <HI>England,</HI> came not unto the Earls of <HI>Oxford</HI> by that Marriage, or by any other, but was invested in that Family, before they had attained the Title and Degree of Earls: Conferred by King <HI>Henry</HI> the first on <HI>Aubrey de Vere,</HI> a right puissant Person, and afterwards on <HI>Aubrey de Vere</HI> his Son, together with the Earldome of <HI>Oxford,</HI> by King <HI>Henry</HI> the second; continuing Hereditary in that House, till the death of <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the ninth Earl thereof, and then bestowed for a time at the Kings discre∣tion, and at last setled by King <HI>Charls</HI> in the House of <HI>Lindsey.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is nothing <HI>Confutatory</HI> of Me, who never affirmed that the <HI>High-Cham∣berlainship</HI> accrued to the House of <HI>Oxford</HI> by any such match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But because being a <HI>Cambridge</HI> Man, he may be better skill'd in the Earls of that County, let us see what he saith of them; and we shall find, <HI>fol.</HI> 162. That <HI>Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, was the eighth Earl of Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas first, <HI>Richard Duke of York</HI> was not Earl of <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was, he was, he was; as presently (God willing) will appear, beyond all doubt and contradiction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And secondly, If he had been such, he must have been the seventh Earl, and not the eighth: For thus those Earls are marshalled in our <HI>Catalogues of Honor,</HI> and

<HI>Books of Heraldry, viz.</HI> 1. <HI>William de Meschines.</HI> 2. <HI>Iohn de Hainalt.</HI> 3. <HI>William Marquess of Iuliers.</HI> 4. <HI>Edmond of Langley, D. of York.</HI> 5. <HI>Edward D. of York.</HI> 6. <HI>Richard de Conisburgh, younger Brother of Edward.</HI> 7. <HI>Iames Marquess Hamil∣ton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>No <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> to be found amongst them; his Father, <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Konisburgh,</HI> having lost that Title by Attainder, which never was restored to <HI>Richard</HI> his Son (though most improvidently advanced to the Dukedom of <HI>York</HI>) nor unto any other of that Line and Family.</P>

<P>I admire at the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s peremptoriness in this point, when the no less learned (but more modest) Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> speaking of these <HI>Earls</HI> in the Descri∣ption of <HI>Cambridge-shire,</HI> saith, that after the death of <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Conisburgh,</HI>
<Q>The Title of the Earl of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> either wholly vanished with him, or else lay hid amongst the Titles of <HI>Richard</HI> his Son, who was restored Duke of <HI>York</HI> as Kinsman and Heir to his Uncle <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>York.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What he warily said <HI>laid hid,</HI> is <HI>found out</HI> by such as since wrote on that Subject, Mr. <HI>Brooke, York Herald,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Augustine Vincent</HI> (in effect Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> revi∣sed;) who writing <HI>Corrections</HI> on <HI>Brooke,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pag. 94, 95.</NOTE> concurreth with him in this particular.
<Q>for <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Conisburgh, Edward</HI>'s Brother, was after created Earl of that place, <HI>[Cambridge]</HI> and after him another <HI>Richard,</HI> who was <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Conisburgh</HI>'s Son.</Q>
See Reader what an Adversary I have gotten, who careth not to write against the most evident and avowed <HI>Truths,</HI> so be it, he may write something against Me.</P>

<P N="4">4. Proceed we in the next place to Verses, and old ends of Poetry, scattered and dispersed in all parts of the History, from one end to the other; for which he hath no precedent in any Historian, Greek or Latine, or any of the National Histories of these latter times: The Histories of <HI>Herodotus, Xenophon, Thucidides</HI> and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> amongst the Greeks; of <HI>Caesar, Livy, Salust, Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius,</HI> amongst the Latines; afford him neither warrant nor example for it: The like may be affirmed of <HI>Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, Ruffin</HI> and <HI>Evagrius,</HI> Church-Historians all; though they had all the best choice, and the most excel∣lent Poets of the world to befriend them in it: And he that shall consult the Historyes of succeeding times, through all the Ages of the Church, to this present day, will find them all as barren of any incouragements in this kind, as the ancients were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never had <HI>Herodotus</HI> given his <HI>Nine Books</HI> the names of the <HI>Nine Muses,</HI> if such was his Abstemiousness from Poetry. Not one of them, which is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in this kind; and there are found in <HI>Clio</HI> the first, no fewer than <HI>thirty</HI> Verses of the Oracles of <HI>Pythia.</HI> As those his Books are <HI>fruitful,</HI> so his Book of the Life of <HI>Homer</HI> hath <HI>a superfetation</HI> of them, so that if <HI>Paose</HI> be the <HI>Warp,
<PB N="36" REF="19" MS="y"/>
Verses</HI> are the <HI>Woof</HI> thereof. Whereas the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> instances in <HI>Plutarch</HI>; open at the life of <HI>Theseus,</HI> and we are presented with Poetry therein.</P>
<P>But grant no precedent in this nature in these Authors. A more free <HI>Genius</HI> acteth in <HI>modern</HI> than in <HI>ancient</HI> Historians, manumissed from the Servilities they were tied (or tied themselves) unto. The Animadvertor, like another <HI>Empson,</HI> endevoureth to revive the Penal Statutes of History against me, (so to subject me to fine for the breach thereof) which Time in effect hath cancelled.</P>
<P><HI>Qui Scribit Historicè, scribit miserè,</HI> if enslaved to all <HI>puntillo's</HI> thereof. Let the Animadvertor keep those <HI>Steel-bodys</HI> for his own wearing, and not force them on me. What, not a <HI>Plait</HI> or a <HI>Ruffle</HI> more or less but all must be done in <HI>Number, Waight,</HI> and <HI>Measure!</HI> according to <HI>Historicall criticisme</HI>! This is not put∣ting the <HI>Book,</HI> but the <HI>Author himself,</HI> into the <HI>Press.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tacitus</HI> himself, (here instanced in) would be <HI>Tacitus</HI> indeed, if all <HI>Politick Sentences</HI> and <HI>prudential results</HI> were deleted in him, being <HI>trespasses</HI> on the <HI>pre∣ciseness of History,</HI> confined to <HI>matter of Fact</HI>: But well-fare that <HI>Historian,</HI> who will go out of his own way, to direct his Reader.</P>
<P>We know <HI>Pliny, Solinus, &amp;c.</HI> in their Topographical description of Countreys, are barren of <HI>verses.</HI> Let the Animadvertor on the same account therefore charge Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> for surcharging his <HI>Britannia</HI> with Poetry, having but three verse∣less Shires, <HI>viz.</HI> (<HI>Dorset, Bucks,</HI> and <HI>Westmerland</HI>) in all <HI>England,</HI> and more than fourscore verses apeece, in the three severall Counties of <HI>Berks, Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Somerset.</HI></P>

<P>Nay, whereas Bishop <HI>Godwin</HI> in his Annals, gives us an Epitaph of two Verses only made on Queen <HI>Iane Seymour,</HI> and afterwards a Copy of eighteen verses on the Martyrdome of Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer</HI>; he ushers in the last with this short Apology, <HI>Contra morem Historiae liceat quaeso inserère,</HI> &amp;c. Let me, (saith he, I beseech you) insert these following verses, though otherwise against the Rule and Laws of History.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>What if that <HI>worthy Prelate</HI> was pleased to pass a <HI>Complement</HI> on his <HI>Reader,</HI> it followeth not that they do want <HI>Civility,</HI> who have less <HI>Courtship</HI> in this Point than he hath. Let us look on his <HI>Catalogue of Bishops,</HI> which hath more vici∣nity with my Subject, and there we shall find (the Bulk of the Book consider∣ed) more verses in proportion, than in my <HI>Church-History,</HI> on the token that where I cite but <HI>four,</HI> he quoteth <HI>fourteen,</HI> out of <HI>Martial,</HI> to prove <HI>Claudia Ruffi∣na</HI> a <HI>Britan,</HI> and a <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But what alas were eighteen or twenty verses compared with those many hundred (six or seven hundred at the least) which we find in our Author, whether to shew the universality of his reading in all kind of Writers, or his faculty in Translating (which when he meets with hard Copies, he knows how to spare) I shall not determine at the present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>If <HI>peeces</HI> of verses be counted <HI>whole ones,</HI> which in this point is no Charitable <HI>Synecdoche,</HI> and if Translations be reckoned distinct Verses, though it is hard that a <HI>Man</HI> and his <HI>Shadow</HI> should be accounted two different persons:</P>
<P>And if the verses in the History of <HI>Cambridge</HI> be adjected, though he who banisheth <HI>Poetry</HI> out of an <HI>University,</HI> will find <HI>Iambicks</HI> enough to pay him for his pains:</P>
<P>And if the verses in the History of <HI>Waltham-Abby</HI> be cast in, though who
<PB N="37" REF="19"/>
shall hinder but I will describe my own Parish in <HI>Prose</HI> or <HI>Poetry</HI> as I think fit; all put together will not amount to the number.</P>
<P>Besides many of my verses may be said to be <HI>Prose in Effect,</HI> as containing the <HI>Religion</HI> of that Age, and therefore alledged as <HI>Evidence</HI> thereof, before the <HI>Norman Conquest</HI>; and no authority can in <HI>Prose</HI> be produced which doth so fully and cleerly represent the same.</P>
<P>Other Verses are generally Epitaphs on some eminent <HI>Church-men,</HI> which could not well be omitted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Certain I am, that by the interlarding of his Prose with so many Verses, he makes his Book look rather like a <HI>Church-Romance,</HI> (our late <HI>Romancers</HI> being much given to such kind of mixtures) than a well-built <HI>Ecclesiastical History.</HI> And if it be a matter so inconvenient to put a <HI>new peice of cloth on an old garment</HI>; the putting of so many <HI>old</HI> patches on a <HI>new peice of cloth,</HI> must be more unfashion∣able. Besides that, many of these old ends are so light and ludicrous, so little pertinent to the business which he has in hand, that they serve only to make sport for Children, <HI>(ut pueris placeas &amp; Declamatio fias)</HI> and for nothing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had the Animadvertor come with a <HI>good stomach,</HI> such <HI>larding</HI> had been no <HI>bad Cookery.</HI> Certain I am, that a <HI>Comment</HI> admitteth less latitude in this kind than a <HI>Church-History.</HI> Certain I am also, that a <HI>Comment on the Creed,</HI> is allow∣ed less Liberty then <HI>other Comments.</HI> Now the Animadvertor hath be scattered <HI>his,</HI> every where with Verses, and Translations. It consisteth not with my Charity to miscall it a <HI>Creed-Romance,</HI> accounting it a sin so to decry or disparage his usefull endevours. The best way to discover the deformity of my Fabrick, is for the Animadvertor to erect a more beautifull Building hard by it, that so his <HI>rare</HI> and <HI>regular,</HI> may shame my <HI>rude</HI> peece of Architecture.</P>
<P>What if such mixtures make the Garment (which also I utterly deny) to be less in the <HI>fashion</HI> (the fondling of Fancy;) I made it not for <HI>Sight</HI> but <HI>Service,</HI> that it might be <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>warm</HI> to the Wearers thereof.</P>
<P>I stand on my justification, that no such <HI>light</HI> or <HI>ludicrous</HI> Verses are to be found in my Book, which render it to just exception. But no wonder if the <HI>Bel clinketh</HI> even as the prejudic'd Hearer <HI>thinketh thereof.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This leads me to the next impertinency, his raking into the Chanel of old <HI>Po∣pish Legends,</HI> writ in the darker times of Superstition, but written with an honest zeal, and a good intention, as well to raise the Reader to the admiration of the person of whom they write, as to the emulation of his virtues: But being mixt with some <HI>Monkish</HI> dotages, the most learned and ingenious men in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> have now laid them by; and it had been very well if our Author had done so to, but that there must be something of entertainment for the gentle Reader, and to inflame the reckoning which he pays not for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not <HI>raked</HI> into the <HI>Kennel of old Popish Legends,</HI> who took the clearest water, in this kind, out of those <HI>Rivers</HI> which run, at this day, in highest Reputa∣tion with the Romanists. I never cited any <HI>Legend</HI> but either out of <HI>Harpsfield,</HI> who wrote in the last <HI>Generation,</HI> and was as <HI>Ingenuous</HI> as any of his Perswasion; or else out of <HI>Hierom Porter</HI> his <HI>Flores Sanctorum,</HI> who wrot some <HI>forty years,</HI> and in high esteem with the Papists at this day, as appears by the dear price thereof.</P>
<P>I confess I have instanced (taking <HI>ten</HI> perchance out of <HI>ten thousand</HI>) in the <HI>grossest</HI> of them, (that is the <HI>fairest Monster,</HI> which is most <HI>Deformed</HI>) partly to shew what a <HI>Spirit of Delusion</HI> acted in <HI>that Age,</HI> partly to raise our <HI>Gratitude to God,</HI> seeing such <HI>Lying vanities,</HI> are now ridiculous even to children.</P>
<P>I believe not the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> when saying, that the <HI>most learned and Ingenious of Rome have laid them aside,</HI> seeing <HI>Cornelius à lapide</HI> weaveth them in, all along his
<PB N="38" REF="20"/>
<HI>comments,</HI> and K. <HI>Iames</HI> did justly complain, that <HI>Bellarmine</HI> himself, did mar his <HI>pretty Books of Devotion,</HI> with such <HI>Legendary mixtures.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But above all things, recommend me to his <HI>Merry Tales,</HI> and scraps of <HI>Trencher∣jests,</HI> frequently interlaced in all parts of the History; which if abstracted from the rest, and put into a Book by themselves, might very well be serv'd up for a second course to the <HI>Banquet of Iests,</HI> a Supplement to the old Book, entituled, <HI>Wits, Fits,</HI> and <HI>Fancies</HI>; or an additional Century to the old <HI>Hundred Merry Tales,</HI> so long since extant. But standing as they do, they neither do become the gravity of a <HI>Church-Historian,</HI> nor are consistent with the nature of a sober argument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> should have rendred me liable to just Reproof, by instancing in One of those <HI>Tales</HI> so inconsistent with the gravity of a <HI>Church-Historian</HI>: which no doubt he had done, but because he knew himself unable to produce it.</P>
<P>He, who is often seen to <HI>snap hastily</HI> at, and <HI>feed hungerly</HI> on an <HI>hard crust,</HI> will not be believed if bragging that he can eat <HI>Pheasants</HI> and <HI>Partridges</HI> at his Pleasure. And seeing the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> doth commonly carp and cavil at the <HI>silly shadows</HI> of seeming mistakes, in my Book; it is utterly improbable he can, yet will not, charge me with a fault, which cannot be defended.</P>
<P>But let him at leasure produce the most <HI>light</HI> and <HI>ludicrous</HI> Story in all my Book, and here I stand ready to Parallel it with as <HI>light,</HI> (I say not in the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI>) but in as <HI>Grave Authors</HI> as ever put Pen to Paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But as it seems, our Author came with the same thoughts to the writing of this present History, as Poets anciently address themselves to the writing of Come∣dies, of which thus my <HI>Terence.</HI>
<Q><L>Poeta cum primùm animum ad scribendum appulit.</L>
<L>Id sibi negotii credidit solum dari,</L>
<L>Populo ut placerent quas fecisset fabulas.</L></Q></P>
<P>That is to say,
<Q><L>Thus Poets, when their mind they first apply</L>
<L>In looser verse to frame a Comedy,</L>
<L>Think there is nothing more for them to do,</L>
<L>Then please the people, whom they speak unto.</L></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire that the Animadvertor, who so lately had taxed me for writing and tran∣slating of Verses, will now do the same himself. There is a double <HI>people-pleasing.</HI> One sordid and servile, made of falshood and flattery, which I defie and detest. The other lawful, when men deliver and dress Truth in the most plausible expression. I have a <HI>precedent</HI> above Exception to warrant it, even <HI>Solomon</HI> himself, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.10. <HI>The Preacher sought out Acceptable words.</HI> This I did, and will, aim at in all my writings, and I doubt not but that the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s Stationer doth hope and de∣sire, that he hath thus <HI>pleased people</HI> in his Book, for the advancing of the price, and quickning the Sale thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the last place proceed we to the manifold excursions about the Antiquity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> built on as weak Authority as the <HI>Monkish</HI> Legends, and so impertinent
<PB N="39" REF="20"/>
to the matter which he hath in hand, that the most Reverend <HI>Mat. Parker</HI> (though a <HI>Cambridge</HI> man) in his <HI>Antiquitates Britannicae,</HI> makes no business of it.</P>
<P>The more impertinent, in regard that at the fag-end of his Book there fol∣lows a distinct History of that University, to which all former passages might have been reduced.</P>
<P>But, as it seems, he was resolved to insert nothing in that History but what he had some probable ground for; leaving the <HI>Legendary</HI> part thereof to the <HI>Church-Romance,</HI> as most proper for it. And certainly he is wondrous wise in his gene∣ration.</P>
<P>For fearing lest he might be asked for those <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Chartularies</HI> which fre∣quently he relates unto in the former Books, he tells us in the History of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> fol 53. That they were <HI>burnt</HI> by some of the seditious <HI>Townsmen in the open Market place, Anno</HI> 1380. or thereabouts: So that for want of other ancient evidence, we must take his word; which whether those of <HI>Cambridge</HI> will depend upon, they can best resolve.</P>
<P>For my part I forbear all intermedling in a controversie so clearly stated, and which hath lain so long asleep, till now awakened by our Author to beget new quar∣rels: Such passages in that History as come under any <HI>Animadversion,</HI> have been reduced unto the other, as occasion served, which the Reader may be pleased to take notice of as they come before him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because omitted by Arch-Bishop <HI>Parker,</HI> I have the more Cause and Rea∣son to insert it: Otherwise, had he handled the Subject before, the <HI>Animad∣vertor</HI> would have cryed out <HI>Crambe,</HI> that there was <HI>nothing novel</HI> therein.</P>
<P>Call it (I pray) The FRINGE of my Book, be it but for the <HI>Subjects</HI> sake, whereof it treats, my dear Mother, <HI>the University of Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>I live in the <HI>same generation</HI> with the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> and I hope shall acquit my self as <HI>honest,</HI> which truly is as <HI>wise</HI> as himself. <HI>CHURCH-ROMANCE parciùs ista.</HI></P>
<P>As I tell the <HI>Reader</HI> of the <HI>burning</HI> of those <HI>Original Charters,</HI> so in the same place I <HI>charge</HI> my Margin with my Author, [Dr. <HI>Caius</HI>] and thereby discharge my self.</P>
<P>Doth the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> now <HI>forbear</HI> all intermedling therein, in this Controversy? Why did he not <HI>forbear</HI> before, when setting forth his last <HI>Geography</HI> some five years since? And is it not as lawful for me to <HI>defend,</HI> as for him to <HI>oppose</HI> my <HI>Mother?</HI> When, where, and by whom, was <HI>this Controversie so clearly stated?</HI> Was it by the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> himself? Such a <HI>Party</HI> is unfit for a <HI>Iudge.</HI> Or, was it stated by the <HI>Parliament</HI> mentioned by him 1<SUP>mo.</SUP> <HI>Iacobi,</HI> when, as he telleth us, the Clerk was commanded to place <HI>Oxford</HI> first. But it plainly appears it was not then so clearly decided; but that the question was ever started again, in the late long <HI>Parliament,</HI> with <HI>Arguments</HI> on both Sides. Witness the <HI>printed Speech</HI> of Sir <HI>Simonds D'EWES</HI> on that occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All these extravagancies and impertinencies (which make up a fifth part of the whole Volume) being thus discharged, it is to be presum'd that nothing should remain but a meer Church History, as the Title promiseth. But let us not be too presumptuous on no better grounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s Words, mind me of a Memorable passage, which here∣after he hath in his Animadversions on my <HI>Sixth Book,</HI> or <HI>History of Abbeys.</HI>
<Q><PB N="40" REF="21"/>The Intruder payeth to the Sequestred Minister but a NINETEENTH part in stead of a FIFTH.</Q>
But if the <HI>FIFTH-PART,</HI> in relation to my Book, be here stated to the same proportion, for the <HI>NINETEENTH,</HI> yet will not the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s <HI>measure</HI> be reconciled to the <HI>Standard of Truth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For on a <HI>Melius inquirendum</HI> into the whole course of the Book which we have before us, we shall find too little of the <HI>Church,</HI> and too much of the <HI>State,</HI> I mean too little of the <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> and too much of the <HI>Civil History:</HI> It might be reasonably expected, that in a History of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> we should have heard somewhat of the foundation and enlargement of Cathedral Churches, if not of the more eminent Monasteries and Religious Houses; and that we should have heard somewhat more of the succession of Bishops in their several and respective Sees, their personal Endowments, learned Writings, and other Acts of Piety, Magnificence, and publick Interess, especially when the times afforded any whose names in some of those respects deserv'd to be retain'd in ever∣lasting remembrance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, but the Reader, who hath perused my <HI>Church-History,</HI> will bear me witness, that therein there is a <HI>competent Representation</HI> of all these particu∣lars, so far forth as the Proportion of the Book will bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It might have been expected also, that we should have found more frequent mention of the calling of National and Provincial Synods, with the result of their proceedings, and the great influence which they had on the <HI>Civil State,</HI> spa∣ringly spoken of at the best, and totally discontinued in a manner, from the death of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, until the Conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion of the yeer, 1552. of which no notice had been taken, but that he had a mind to question the Authority of the Book of Articles which came out that year, though publisht as the issue and product of it, by the express Warrant and Command of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>All Councels before the Conquest, with their Canons are compleatly (and the most remarkable, after it) represented in my History. With what face can the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> say that I have discontinued the Acts of the Convocation till the year 1552? The Acts of one [critical] Convocation in the 27 of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, 1535. taking up no less than <HI>eight sheets</HI> in my Book, and another in the same Kings Reign imploying more than a sheet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No mention of that memorable Convocation in the fourth and fifth years of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> in which the Clergy taking notice of an Act of Parliament then newly passed, by which the Subjects of the <HI>Temporality,</HI> having Lands to the yearly value of five pounds, and upwards, were charged with finding Horse and Armour, according to the proportion of their yearly Revenues and Possessions, did by their sole authority, as a Convocation, impose upon themselves and the rest of the Clergy of this Land, the finding of a like number of Horses, Armour, and other Necessaries for the War, according to their yearly income, proportion for proportion, and rate for rate, as by that Statute had been laid on the <HI>Temporal</HI> Subjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am confident that this is the self-same <HI>Convocation</HI> which is thus entered in my <HI>Church-History, Book</HI> 8. <HI>p.</HI> 39. <HI>Anno</HI> 1557. <HI>quinto Mariae.</HI>
<Q><PB N="41" REF="21"/>The Clergy gave the Queen a Subsidie of eight shillings <HI>in the pound</HI> (<HI>confirmed by Act of</HI> Parliament) <HI>to be</HI> paid in four years: In requital <HI>whereof, by</HI> Poole<HI>'s procurement, the Queen</HI> Priviledged them from <HI>shewing their horses</HI> with the Laily; yet so, that they should muster them up for the defence of the Land, under Captains of their own own chusing.</Q></P>
<P>I cannot therefore be justly charged with <HI>no mention</HI> of the Acts of this <HI>Con∣vocation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And this they did by their own sole Authority, as before was said, Ordering the same to be levyed on all such as were refractory, by Sequestration, De∣privation, Suspension, Excommunication, <HI>Ecclesiastical Censures</HI> all; without relating to any subsequent confirmation by Act of Parliament, which they conceiv'd they had no need of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I took the <HI>less notice</HI> of, and gave the <HI>less heed</HI> to the transactions of the Clergy therein, because then they were in their <HI>Hufte</HI> and <HI>Height,</HI> furious with <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Fagot,</HI> so that all done by them <HI>de facto,</HI> cannot be justified for <HI>Legal</HI>; who sometimes <HI>borrowed a point of Law</HI> (even <HI>with intent never to repay it</HI>) in their proceedings. It may be proved out of Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> that some at that time (by a <HI>cruell Prolepsis</HI>) <HI>antedated</HI> the burning of some <HI>Martyrs,</HI> before the Writ <HI>de Haeretico Comburendo</HI> came unto them. Wherefore all their actions in that time are not <HI>Precedential</HI> to warrant <HI>Posterity,</HI> and the <HI>Air</HI> of that <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> will not fit the <HI>Bodyes</HI> in our <HI>Temperate Climate.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor find we any thing of the Convocations of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, ex∣cept that of the year 1562. (and that not fairly dealt with neither, as is else∣where shewed) though there passed many Canons in the Convocation of the year 1571. and of the year 1585. and the year 1597. all Printed, and still publickly extant; besides the memorable Convocation of the year 1555. in which the Clergy gave the Queen a Benevolence of 2 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound, to be levyed by Ecclesiastical Censures, without relating to any subsequent confirmation by Act of Parliament, as had accustomably been used in the Grant of Subsidies.</P>

<P><HI>Bernardus non vidit omnia</HI>; I could not come to the knowledge of every particular.

<P>It might have been expected also that we should have found in a Church-History of <HI>Brittain,</HI> the several degrees and steps by which the Heterodoxies and Superstitions of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> did creep in amongst us; and the degrees by which they were ejected and cast out again, and the whole Refor∣mation setled upon the Doctrine of the Apostles, attended by the Rites and Ceremonies of the Primitive times.</P>

<P>I answer: First, no Drag-net can be so comprehensive as to catch all <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Fry</HI> in the River; I mean, no Historian can descend to every particular.</P>

<P>All which together, make it cleer and evident that there is too little of the Church or Ecclesiastical History in our Authors Book: And that there is too much of the State or Civil History, will be easily seen, by that unnecessary inter∣mixture of State-Concernments, not pertinent to the business which he hath in hand.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answer first in general; Such the <HI>sympathy</HI> betwixt the embracing <HI>Twins, Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> that sometimes 'tis both painful and pity to part them. More parti∣cularly, such passages have at the least a <HI>cast</HI> or <HI>eye</HI> of <HI>Church-colour</HI> in them, or else they are inserted for necessity, <HI>Ne detur vacuum,</HI> for meer lack of <HI>Church-matter.</HI> All the Ecclesiastical History in Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, will not fill his hollow Pen, the cause why he makes it up with History of the State; and I sometimes do the like. Lastly, it is done for Variety, (and then, commonly, I crave the Readers leave) which I hope is no offence. Must I turn <HI>School-boy</HI> again, and the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> be my <HI>School-master,</HI> to give me a <HI>Theam,</HI> that I must write on no other Subject, but what he appoints me?</P>

<P>Of this sort to look no further, is the long Will and Testament of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, with his Gloss or Comment on the same, taking up three whole sheets at least, in which there is not any thing which concerns Religion, or which relates unto the Church, or Church-affairs; although to have the better colour to bring it in, he tells us that he hath transcribed it, not onely for the rarity thereof, but because it <HI>contained many passages which might reflect much light upon Church-History.</HI></P>

<P>I answer first, All ancient <HI>Wills</HI> have something of <HI>Sacredness</HI> in them, begin∣ning <HI>In the name of God Amen.</HI> Secondly, they are proved in the <HI>Court-Christian,</HI> which evidenceth something of <HI>Ecclesiasticalness</HI> in them. Thirdly, <HI>Kings</HI> have ever been beheld as <HI>mixt Persons,</HI> wherein <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> are <HI>blended</HI> together. Fourthly, the <HI>Will</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in that <HI>Active-juncture</HI> of times, is more than the <HI>Will</HI> of an <HI>ordinary King.</HI> Fiftly, it is most remarkable even in <HI>Church-History,</HI> if only on this Account, to shew that he who had violated the <HI>Testaments</HI> of so many <HI>Founders</HI> and <HI>Benefactors,</HI> had hardly any <HI>one Particular</HI> of his <HI>own Will</HI> performed.

Of this sort also is his description of the pomp and order of the Coronation of King <HI>Charles,</HI> which though he doth acknowledge not to be within <HI>Pale and Park</HI> of <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> History, yet he resolves to bring it in, because it comes within the <HI>Purlews</HI> of it, as his own words are: But for this he hath a better reason than we are aware of, that is to say, <HI>That if hereafter Divine Providence shall assign</HI> England <HI>another King, though the transactions here∣in be not wholly precedential, something of State may be chosen out gratefull for im∣itation.</HI></P>

<P>Lastly, though the <HI>Heralds</HI> Office doth carefully preserve all such Ceremonyes, yet cannot all persons living at great distance, and desiring information here∣in, have on all occasions so facill and convenient access to their <HI>Office,</HI> as to my Printed Book.</P>

<P>Who would not think, but that (as the Charge standeth against me) I had branded all <HI>Conformists</HI> with the Note of <HI>Covetous,</HI> which had been an <HI>Abomi∣nable Scandall</HI> indeed. Whereas my words only relate to some particular per∣sons: whom, if the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> will say, they were <HI>Conformists,</HI> (as indeed they were;) I dare sweare, (if called thereunto) that they were Covetous, as who, by <HI>Unreasonable Leases,</HI> (as the Statute calleth them) wasted the Lands of the Church, till they were seasonably retrenched by that wholesom Law made the 13.<SUP>th.</SUP> of Q. <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Regular Clergy</HI> they might be, (as the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> termeth them) in other things, but in this particular, <HI>Regular,</HI> only to the Rules of Avarice: making such Leases against <HI>Reason,</HI> and common Equity, though, in the Rigor of the [then] Law, justifiable; I wonder that the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> will advocate for their Actions so detrimental to the Church.</P>
<P>Nor doth this dash the least disgrace on <HI>Conformity</HI> it self, they not doing it <HI>quà Conformists.</HI> It was not their <HI>Conformity</HI> made them Covetous, (though perchance their Covetousnesse might make them conformable) but their own <HI>Corruption.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Epithet of <HI>Covetous</HI> be so offensive, I will in my next Edition, to mend the Matter, change it into <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rilegious Conformity,</HI> and justifie my Expression, according to the Principle of the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s own Judgement, because they enriched themselves with impayring the goods of the Church.</P>

<P>If I stand endebted to so many for wronging of them, the fairest way is for them jointly, to seize on what I have, that so my small Estate may be shared amongst them all, so far as it will go, and every one have his Proportion thereof: Whereas now the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> taking all (and more then all) his <HI>Penny-worths</HI> out of Me, he hath injuriously dealt with the rest of the Creditors thereby. However, I hope to appear responsible, (seeing <HI>no debt is soon satisfied</HI>) and the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> himself in due time, will be found in my debt, if all accounts be equally audited betwixt us.</P>
<P>This I dare boldly say (though I confess his faults excuse not mine, if guilty) that he hath wronged more, and Persons of higher quality, in his late Books.

<P>But nothing does more evidently discover his unfaithfull dealing, then his report of the proceedings in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> between his Majesty, and the long-Parliament Divines; of which he tells us, <HI>Lib.</HI> 11. <HI>fol.</HI> 235. <HI>That his Majesty, in the last Paper which he sent them, acknowledged their great pains to inform his Iudgement, according to their perswasions, and also took especial no∣tice of their Civilities of the Application both in the beginning and body of their Reply</HI>; and having cleer'd himself from some mis-understanding about the Writ of <HI>Partition</HI> which they speak of, puts an end to the businesse. The man who reads this passage, cannot choose but think that his Majesty, being van∣quisht by the Arguments of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> had given over the cause; and therefore, as convicted in his Conscience, rendreth them thanks for the In∣struction which he had received, and the Civilities they used towards him in the way thereof. But he that looks upon his Majestie's last Paper, will find that he had Learnedly and Divinely refel'd all their Arguments: And having so done, puts them in mind of three questions which are propos'd in his former Paper, acknowledged by themselves, to be of great importance in the present controversie; without an Answer whereunto, his Majesty declared that he would put an end to that conference: <HI>It not being probable</HI> (as he told them) <HI>that they should work much upon his Iudgement, whilst they are fearfull to declare their own, nor possible to relieve his conscience, but by a free declaring of theirs.</HI> But they not able, or not daring, (for fear of displeasing their great Masters) to return an Answer to those Questions, his Majesty remain'd sole Master of the field, a most absolute Conquerour: For though the first blow commonly does begin the Quarrel, it is the last blow always that gets the Victory: But <HI>Regium est cum benefeceris malè audire</HI>: It hath been commonly the fortune of the greatest Princes, when they deserve best, to be worst reported.</P>

<P>The Chappel of <HI>Emanuel</HI> Colledge in <HI>Cambridge</HI> is built North and South, contrary to the usage of the primitive times; and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> with which King <HI>Iames</HI> being made acquainted, he answered (as our Author tels us) <HI>That it was no matter how the Chappel stood, so the heart stood aright</HI>: Which Tale being told by him, and believed by others (<HI>&amp; populum, qui sibi credit, habet,</HI> Ovid. in Ep.

<P>What need we put our selves or others to the charge of Surplices and Hoods, of Gowns and Cassacks, in the officiating of Gods Service; It is no matter in what habit the Body be, <HI>so the heart be right.</HI> There is another Chappel in <HI>Cambridge</HI> which was never <HI>consecrated,</HI> (whether a <HI>Stable</HI> or a <HI>Dormitory,</HI> is all one to me.) At which time when some found themselves grieved, our Author tells them, <HI>This others of us great Learning and Religion</HI> (himself espe∣cially
<PB N="50" REF="26"/>
for one) <HI>dare defend, that the continued</HI> Series of Divine Duties, <HI>pub∣lickly practised for more then thirty years (without the least check or controul of those in authority) in a place set apart to that purpose, doth sufficiently consecrate the same: Stables</HI> and <HI>Barns</HI> by this Argument, shall in some tract of time become as sacred as our Churches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had I lived in <HI>Sidney</HI> Colledge, when that <HI>Dormitory</HI> was first used for a <HI>Chappel,</HI> I would have <HI>advised,</HI> and (in my Sphere) <HI>advanced</HI> its consecration; accounting the Omission to fall under just reproof. But seeing it hath been so long omitted, I now conceive it hath no need of <HI>Consecration,</HI> seeing though never solemnly and formally dedicated to Divine Service by the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> (or one deputed by him) yet hath it had a <HI>tacite, &amp; interpretative</HI> Consecration, and thereby hath contracted a <HI>relative</HI> Sacrednesse. By the same <HI>Proportion,</HI> it is, that <HI>Utensils,</HI> long used in a Family, to most civill and generous imploy∣ment, by degrees acquire to themselves, the Reputation (in the Apostle's language) of <HI>vessels of honour</HI>; as being opposed to such vessels imployed in sordid (though necessary) Service, and of the same metal and matter.</P>
<P>I doubt not but if this place used for a Chappel (now about a Jubilee of years) should be turned to a <HI>Stable,</HI> the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> would behold it (and justly too) as a piece of Prophanation, and this <HI>intimates</HI> a <HI>Sacrednesse</HI> therein.</P>
<P>It is mainly material, that Bishop <HI>Andrews,</HI> of <HI>Ely,</HI> a Reverend Prelate, and as knowing as any of his Order in this point of Antiquity; knew this to be in his Diocesse, yet never manifested the least Regreet at the <HI>Chappelizing</HI> of this Place.</P>
<P>As for consecration of Churches and Chappels, I say; first, is no <HI>Sacra∣mental action.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, It is not of <HI>Evangelical Institution,</HI> as <HI>Bellarmine</HI> himself doth freely confesse, no <HI>Express</HI> for it in the New-Testament.
<Q><BIBL>De cultu Sanctorum. lib. <HI>3.</HI> cap. <HI>5.</HI></BIBL>
<L>In statu Evangelii non habemus tam expressa testimonia Scripturae.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thirdly, It is charitably to be presumed, that when Dr. <HI>Montague,</HI> and the fellows first entred the <HI>Dormitory,</HI> sequestring that place for a <HI>Chappel,</HI> they by Prayers and a Sermon, did solemnly consign it, to the Service of God: seeing no man of common Principles of Piety, will offer to eat meat, before he hath said <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Such Prayers did in some sort Dedicate the place, wanting no formality, save, because not done by a Bishop; and if this be all the fault can be found therein, let the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> prove, (<HI>probatio incumbit affirmanti</HI>) that in the <HI>primitive</HI> Times, consecrating of Churches was only an <HI>Episcopal Act.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, What was wanting in the consecration at the first, hath since suf∣ficiently been supplyed and corroborated by usance thereof to Gods Service only.</P>
<P>If factious people, should, in peaceable times, against lawfull Authority con∣venticle in a <HI>Barn</HI> or <HI>Stable</HI>; their Meetings, (sinfull in themselves) could not derive any Sacrednesse to the place, whilst the World lasteth.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Persecution,</HI> which God of his goodness avert (though we by our wickednesse deserve it) should invade our Land; I conceive, Stables are, by Prayers, and presence of God's <HI>suffering Servants,</HI> and chiefly by God's presence with them, at the minute of their entrance thither, elevated into Holy places.</P>

<P>And if the Brethren think it not enough for their ease to be pent up in so narrow a Room, tis but repairing to the next <HI>Grove</HI> or <HI>Coppise,</HI> and that in a like traet of time shall become as holy as <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple, or any <HI>consecrated</HI> place whatso∣ever it be.</P>

<P>Not the solemnest Consecration, can advance our Churches into the same degree of Sacredness with <HI>Solomon's Temple,</HI> which was (yea might bee) but <HI>one,</HI> dignified (when dedicated) with God his <HI>Glorious</HI> Presence, 2 <HI>Chro.</HI> 7.12. <HI>Who chose that place to himself for an house of Sacrifice.</HI> It was the Type of our blessed Saviour, perfect in all Points, as made by inspired Architects; and the utensils in the <HI>Holy of Holiest,</HI> the self same which <HI>Moses</HI> made according to the pattern in the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>

<P>God forbid! The clean contrary followeth from my Position, wherein I do offer an Argument for the Sacredness of Places, the Register of whose Consecration is lost, as <HI>Time</HI> out of <HI>Mind,</HI> so that now they can no other∣wise prove it, (no Record being extant thereof) save by <HI>pious Prescription.</HI> Enough in my Judgement to give Sacriledge, <HI>a Rap over the fingers,</HI> if offe∣ring to lay hold on such places and buildings, and turn them to her private Profit.</P>
<P>Were it in my power, I would have built a <HI>Church,</HI> where I only made my <HI>Church-History.</HI> But the worst is, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> would then have quar∣relled the contriving and adorning of my Church, as much as now he doth the matter and making of my Book; and therefore I leave it to others, of more ability, first to do, and then to defend their good Actions, from his <HI>Morosity.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Et jam sinis erat</HI>; And here I thought I should have ended this Anatomy of our Author's Book, but that there is another passage in the Preface thereof, which requires a little further consideration.</P>
<P>For in that Preface he informs us, by the way of caution, <HI>That the three first Books were for the main written in the Reign of the late King, as appeareth by the Passages then proper for the Government: The other nine Books were made since Monarchy was turned into a State.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath fairly and fully (no constant Practice) cited my words; I request the Reader to take especial notice of those <HI>three FOR THE MAIN</HI></P>
<P>I presume the Reader conceiveth such a caveat not improper or impertinent, but safe and seasonable, for my Defence, and his Direction, especially seeing the like happened not to any <HI>English</HI> Historian, this <HI>thousand</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Govern∣ment of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> though often translat∣ed from one <HI>Family,</HI> yea <HI>Nation</HI> to a∣nother, yet hath so long continued <HI>Monarchical.</HI></NOTE> <HI>years,</HI> that his Pen (during the writing of his Book) should pass through <HI>Climates</HI> of different Governments.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By which it seems, that our Author never meant to frame his History by the line of Truth, but to attemper it to the palat of the present Govern∣ment, whatsoever it then was, or should prove to be; which I am sure agrees not with the Laws of History.</P>
<P>And though I can most easily grant, that the fourth Book and the rest that follow, were written after the great alteration and change of State, in making a <HI>new</HI> Common-wealth out of the ruines of an ancient Monarchy; yet I con∣cur not with our Author in the time of the former: For it appears by some passages, that the three first Books either were not all written in the time of the King, or else he must give himself some disloyal hopes, that the King should never be restored to his place and Power, by which he might be called to a reckoning for them.</P>

<P><HI>It Seems.</HI> [<HI>Multa videntur quae non sunt.</HI>] The Inference is false and forced; <HI>Titus Livius</HI> lived in <HI>Imperial,</HI> yet wrote of <HI>Regal, Consulatory, Tribunitial</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> without the least imputation of falshood. I conceive <HI>Monarchical Aristocratical</HI> and <HI>Democralical</HI> truth, to be One and the Same: It followeth not, that two-faced <HI>Ianus</HI> (as beholding two worlds, one before, the other after the Flood) had also two <HI>Hearts.</HI> I did not attemper my History to the Palat of the Govern∣ment; so as to sweeten it with any <HI>Falshood</HI>; but I made it <HI>Palatable</HI> thus far forth as not to give a wilful disgust to those in present Power, and procure danger to my self, by using any <HI>over-salt tart</HI> or <HI>bitter</HI> Expression, better forborn than inserted, without any prejudice to the Truth.</P>

But when Ceremonyes shall <HI>devour their distance,</HI> and in∣trude themselves <HI>necessary</HI> and <HI>essential,</HI> it is high time to term them <HI>Superstiti∣tious Trinkets.</HI> The rest I referr to what I have written, when this passage recurreth in the place cited by the <HI>Animadvertor.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, speaking of the precedency which was fixt in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by re∣moving the Archiepiscopal See from <HI>London</HI> thither, he telleth us that <HI>the matter is not much, which See went first, when living; seeing our Age hath laid them both alike level in their Graves</HI>: But certainly the Government was not changed into a State or Commonwealth, till the death of the King; and till the death of the King, neither of those Episcopall Sees, nor any of the rest, were laid so level in <HI>their Graves,</HI> but that they were in hope of a Resurrection; the King declaring himself very constantly in the Treaty at the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> as well against the abolishing of the Episcopal Government, as the alienation of their Lands.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In the latter end of the same Book, he makes a great dispute a∣gainst the high and sacred priviledge of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> in curing the disease comonly called the <HI>Kings Evil,</HI> whether to be imputed to <HI>Magick,</HI> or <HI>Imagi∣nation,</HI> or indeed a <HI>Miracle</HI>; next, brings us in an old Wives Tale about Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as if she had disclaimed that power she daily exercised; and final∣ly, manageth a Quarrel against the form of Prayer used at the curing of that Evil, which he arraigns for Superstition and impertinencies, no inferior Crimes: Are all these passages proper to that Government also?</P>
<P>Finally in the third Book, he derogates from the power of the Church in making <HI>Canons,</HI> giving the binding and concluding Power in matters which concern the civil Rights of the Subjects, not to the King, but to the Lay-people of the Land assembled in Parliament; which game he after followeth in the eighth and last: And though it might be safe enough for him in the eighth and last, to derogate in this manner from the King's supremacy in Ecclesiastical affairs; yet certainly it was neither safe for him so to do, nor proper for him so to write, in the time of the <HI>Kingly Government,</HI> unless he had some such wretched hopes as before we spake of.</P>

<P>I desire the Reader, to remember my late words, (as the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> re∣cited them) <HI>FOR THE MAIN.</HI></P>
<P>I confess, though these Books were written in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI>; yet after his Death, I interpolated some lines, and amongst others, that of <HI>level∣ling</HI> all <HI>Bishopricks.</HI></P>
<P>I raised no dispute against the <HI>Kings</HI> curing the <HI>Evil,</HI> it being raised be∣fore I was born, and which I endeavoured to <HI>allay,</HI> referring it to <HI>Miracle,</HI> as to the peruser of my History, in that place will appear. I tell no old Wives Tale of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it being a <HI>Masculine Truth,</HI> from most authen∣tick Authors.</P>
<P>I <HI>derogate</HI> not, in the least degree, from the power of the Church; but the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> doth <HI>arrogate</HI> unto it more then is due, by the Lawes of God and Man: maintaining that Church-men may go beyond <HI>Ecclesiastical Censures,</HI> even to the Limbs and <HI>Lives</HI> of such! as are <HI>Recusants</HI> to their <HI>Constitutions.</HI></P>

<P>Here give me leave to tell the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> that such whom he slighteth for <HI>LOW-ROYALISTS,</HI> were (whilst they had a King in <HI>England</HI>) as <HI>HIGH</HI> in their Loyalty to him, <HI>Prayers</HI> and Sufferings for him, as those <HI>HIGH-ROI∣ALISTS,</HI> who maintain that all goods of the Subjects are at the King's <HI>abso∣lute Dispose,</HI> and yet since those Kings are departed this life, can write of them in so base and disparaging Language, that any one of the <HI>LOW-ROIALISTS,</HI> would have his right hand cut off, rather then write the like. <HI>Reader,</HI> pardon my too just passion, when <HI>DISLOIALTY</HI> is laid to my charge: It is with me <HI>Either now speak or else for ever hereafter hold your Peace.</HI></P>

<P>I am glad to hear this <HI>Passage</HI> from the <HI>Animadvertor, that I never did him any In∣jury</HI>; the rather because some of my Friends have charged me for <HI>provoking</HI> his <HI>Pen</HI> against me. And though I pleaded that neither in Thought, Word, or Deed, I ever did him any wrong, I hardly prevailed with them for beliefe: And now the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath cleared me, that I <HI>never</HI> did any Injury unto him. Would I could say the same of him, that he <HI>never</HI> did me any Injury. However, as a <HI>Christian,</HI> I here fully and freely forgive him, and hereafter will ende∣vour as a <HI>Scholar,</HI> so to defend my self against his Injury, that (God willing) it shall not shake my <HI>Contentment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Without relation to my person,</HI> let the Reader be Judge hereof. Indeed <HI>Thomas</HI> hath been well used by him, but <HI>Fuller</HI> hath soundly felt his displeasure. However, if <HI>Truth,</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> have been abused by me; He hath given Me too <HI>fair quarter,</HI> who deserved <HI>Death down-right,</HI> for so hainous an Offence.</P>
<P>Amongst all which Persons inciting him to write against me, one Letter sent to him, from <HI>Regina Pecunia</HI> was most prevalent with him. Witnesse this his Book offered to, and refused by some <HI>Stationers,</HI> because, on his high terms, they could not make a saving Bargain to themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Iacta est alea.</HI> The English is, <HI>you have cast the Dey.</HI> And seeing the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> hath begun the <HI>Metaphor,</HI> I hope I may make it an <HI>Allegory,</HI> without rendring either of us <HI>Scandalous.</HI> I appeal to the <HI>Reader,</HI> whom I make <HI>Groom Porter,</HI> (termed by Mr. <HI>Camb. Aleatorum Arbiter</HI>) and let him judge, who <HI>plays</HI> with <HI>False,</HI> who <HI>Coggs,</HI> who <HI>slurrs a Dey</HI> and in a doubtful <HI>Case,</HI> when we cannot agree upon the <HI>Cast</HI>; betwixt our selves, let him <HI>decide</HI> it.</P>
<P>By <HI>Fortune,</HI> I presume the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> intendeth nothing derogatory to divine Providence, in which Sense St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> retracteth his [former] frequent using of the Word. Only he meaneth <HI>uncertainty of Successe.</HI> In which notion I say an hearty <HI>Amen</HI> to his Prayer, when I have enlarged <HI>his God speed me</HI> into <HI>God speed US well.</HI> May he, who manageth this <HI>Controversie,</HI> with most <HI>Sincerity,</HI> come off with best <HI>Successe.</HI> AMEN.</P>

<P>First, to prevent all Exceptions, that I have <HI>defectively</HI> presented in his Book.</P>

<P>I make no other use hereof save only to crave the like Favour, in my own Defence, when in the <HI>Earls of March, Roger</HI> is misprinted <HI>Edward</HI>; and in the <HI>Earls of Bath, Henry</HI> is misprinted <HI>William,</HI> in my <HI>Church History.</HI></P>
<P>I confess there be some Press faults in this my Book, as for <HI>Prelial,</HI> (wherever occurring) read <HI>Prelal</HI>; part 1. p. 50. l. 32. for <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 580 r. 560. part. 1. p. 52. l. 18. for <HI>DEMOL</HI> r. <HI>DEINOL.</HI> and part 2. page 88. betwixt the 33. and 34 l. insert I pray,</P>

<SP>

<P>But yet not in a vvorse condition then the other <HI>Gentiles,</HI> vvho vvere not one∣ly <HI>darkened</HI> in their <HI>understanding,</HI> but so deprav'd also in their affections, as to <HI>work all manner of uncleanness even with greediness.</HI> Not so effeminate in their conversation as the <HI>Asiaticks,</HI> nor so luxurious as the <HI>Greeks,</HI> nor branded with those filthy and unnaturall lusts which <HI>St. Paul</HI> chargeth on the <HI>Romans,</HI> and were in ordinary practise with most Eastern Nations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of all this? It is said of <HI>King</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 King. 3.2.</NOTE> <HI>Ioram, He wrought evill in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father and like his mother.</HI> It is said of <HI>King</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 King. 17.2.</NOTE> <HI>Hoshea, He did that which was evill in the sight of the Lord, but not as the Kings of Israel that were before him.</HI> It doth not follow, that these Kings were good, because less bad then others. So that my words stand an <HI>un-shakened truth,</HI> that the <HI>Brittains</HI> be∣fore their <HI>conversion</HI> were (though not so debauched as other Heathens) <HI>Idola∣ters, in a sad condition.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And though they were <HI>Idolaters,</HI> yea, and <HI>foul</HI> ones, as our Author hath it; yet neither, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they were <HI>Idolaters,</HI> they must be <HI>foul ones,</HI> except (as one hath <HI>fancied</HI> a <HI>tale</HI> of a <HI>fair Aethiopian</HI>) any could make a <HI>truth</HI> of <HI>fair Idolaters.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yet neither were their gods of so brutish and impure a nature, as the <HI>Pria∣pus, Cloacina,</HI> and <HI>Stercutia</HI> amongst the <HI>Romans</HI>; or as their <HI>Venus, Flora, Lupa,</HI> common Harlots. All of vvhich, and such like other gods, the old Fathers tell
<PB N="50" REF="30" MS="y"/>
us, that they vvere not <HI>nomina Colendorum, sed crimina Colentium.</HI> Nor vvere they so immodest and obscene in their rites and ceremonies, as were the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> in the Sacrifices to their <HI>Cybele</HI> or <HI>Berecynthia,</HI> vvhom they call the <HI>mother of the gods</HI>; described by <HI>Arnobius, Lactantius,</HI> and others of the antient Writers, in such lively colours, as no chaste eye can look upon them without detestation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well may the <HI>Doctor</HI> run apace, drawing an <HI>empty Cart</HI> after him. What is all this to confute my position, that the <HI>unconverted Brittains, foul Idolaters, were in a sad condition</HI>? It seems he had a mind to tell the world of the foulest <HI>Idolls</HI> amongst the <HI>Romans</HI>; and, if so, let them thank him for his intelligence, who knew it not before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And for the number of their gods, they fell extreamly short of that infinite multitude, which St. <HI>Augustine</HI> finds amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> our Author naming onely three, (which he calls <HI>gods paramount</HI>) that is to say, BELINUS, AN∣DATE, and DIANA.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they had onely <HI>three gods,</HI> they had <HI>two too many,</HI> However, it will appear, that <HI>these</HI> were onely (as the Author phraseth them) <HI>Paramount</HI>▪ That they fell not (to use the Doctor's words) <HI>extreamly short</HI> (a virtuous <HI>ex∣tream</HI>) of the <HI>Romans</HI> in their <HI>Idolatry,</HI> may thus be proved.
<Q><P>They that had Idolls almost exceeding the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> in number, fell not much short of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>But the antient <HI>Brittains</HI> almost exceeded the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> in number of Idolls.</P>
<P>Therefore they fell not much short of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Major</HI> is plain in <HI>Scripture,</HI> often complaining of the <HI>Idols of Aegypt</HI>; as also in <HI>human Writers, Iuvenal</HI> jeering the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> for being <HI>over-stocked</HI> with such <HI>kind of cattle,</HI> whose gods (<HI>Leeks</HI> and <HI>Onyons</HI>) did commonly grow in their Gardens.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minor</HI> are the very words of <HI>grave Gildas,</HI> the most <HI>antient Brittish</HI> Wri∣ter, (flourishing <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 580.) <HI>Portenta pene numero Aegyptiaca vincentia.</HI> Where, in few words, we have the <HI>Numerosity</HI> and <HI>Monstrosity</HI> of the <HI>Brittish Idols. Numerosity,</HI> almost exceeding the <HI>Aegyptians; Monstrosity,</HI> called <HI>Portents,</HI> mishapen Anticks of prodigious deformity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When therefore <HI>Gildas</HI> telleth us of the <HI>antient Brittains,</HI> that in the number of their gods they had almost exceeded <HI>Aegypt,</HI> (<HI>Portenta pene numero Aegyptiaca vincentia,</HI> in that Author's language) it must be understood with reference to the Times in which he lived, when all the <HI>Roman</HI> Rabble had been thrust upon them, and not as speaking of the time of their first Conversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Satis pro Imperio,</HI> MUST <HI>is for a King</HI>; and seeing the Doctor and I are both <HI>Kings</HI> alike, I return, He MUST NOT be so understood; as, to any <HI>judicious</HI> and <HI>indifferent Reader</HI> will appear.</P>
<P>For the clearing hereof, I will present and translate the words of <HI>Gildas,</HI> with what precedeth and followeth them, conducing effectually to the true understanding of this clause controverted. I use the first and best printed Editi∣on, set forth by <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> 1523. and Dedicated to <HI>Cuthbert Tonstall,</HI> then the learned Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> Onely because I suspect, that some Readers will be <HI>out of breath</HI> in going along with the <HI>long-winded style</HI> of <HI>Gildas,</HI> (the excusable fault of the Age he lived in) I crave leave to divide his long and entire Sen∣tence,

<P>But whether their <HI>Idols</HI> were <HI>more</HI> or <HI>fewer,</HI> our <HI>Author</HI> is resolved on DIA∣NA for one though whether this were a <HI>Brittish deity</HI> may be more then que∣stioned, whose <HI>Temple</HI> was built in, or near the place, where St. <HI>Pauls</HI> now stands, as our <HI>learned Antiquaries</HI> do acknowledge.</P>

<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> doth confesse, that the <HI>Brittans</HI> did worship <HI>Diana</HI>: But whether she was one of the latter brood of Idols, brought in by the <HI>Romans</HI> at their Conquest; or hatched long before amongst the <HI>Brittains,</HI> as their <HI>own Coun∣try-goddess,</HI> is the Question. I am confident in the latter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brittish Stories</HI> tell us, that <HI>Brutus</HI> (some <HI>hundred</HI> of <HI>years</HI> before the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> arrived here) being upon his Sea-voyage to seek his fortune, repaired to the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Diana,</HI> in an <HI>Island</HI> called <HI>Largeria,</HI> and there addressing him∣self to her Temple, was in a dream not onely instructed in the manner of her sacrifices, and rituall services; but also directed to an Island in the West, now <HI>Brittain,</HI> where his Posterity should fix themselves in happiness. And that this passeth for currant amongst the <HI>Welch,</HI> I report my self to their <HI>learned Gentry,</HI> the proper judges thereof.</P>
<P>Let me add this Passage from the Pen of as great an Antiquary, as any <HI>Wales</HI> now doth enjoy.
<Q>As for the name of <HI>Diana,</HI> I do conceive that she was called <HI>Dain</HI> in our Language; and I have many Histories of our Nation, that seem to make no que∣stion of it. To this day in <HI>Wales, fatt marketable Cattle</HI> are called <HI>Guartheg Demol;</HI> that is to say, <HI>Diana's Cattle,</HI> or, <HI>Cattle fit to be sacrificed, &amp;c.</HI> And I am more then confident, there is no man living can put any other interpre∣tation upon this word <HI>Demol;</HI> it must be an Adjective of <HI>Dain,</HI> and <HI>Dain</HI> hath no other signification in our Language, then the name of <HI>Diana.</HI></Q></P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Diana</HI> in <HI>London</HI> (saith the Author) <HI>rendreth their conceit not altogether unlikely, who will have</HI> London <HI>so called from</HI> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an-Dian, <HI>which signifieth in Brittish, the Temple of</HI> Diana.] A conceit, whosesoever it was, not <HI>altogether</HI> so <HI>likely</HI> neither as the Author makes it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>cautiousness</HI> of proof against <HI>captiousness.</HI> I called it but a <HI>conceit,</HI> I said not that it was <HI>true</HI>; yea, my words left an <HI>insinuation</HI> of <HI>unlikeliness</HI> to an indif∣ferent Reader.

<P>A <HI>conceit,</HI> LONDON from LLAN-DIAN, whosesoever it was; not <HI>altoge∣ther</HI> so <HI>likely</HI> neither as the <HI>Author</HI> makes it. For though the <HI>Brittains</HI> being well stored with <HI>Wood</HI> and <HI>Venison,</HI> possibly might have a <HI>Hunting-goddess</HI> amongst the <HI>rest.</HI> Yet certainly she was not called by the name of <HI>Diana,</HI> till the <HI>Roman Conquest</HI> and <HI>Plantations,</HI> before which time this <HI>City</HI> had the name of <HI>London,</HI> (or <HI>Londinum</HI>) as we read in <HI>Tacitus.</HI> The <HI>name</HI> and <HI>sacrifices</HI> of <HI>Diana</HI> were not <HI>originally Brittish,</HI> but of <HI>Roman race,</HI> as the <HI>great Temple</HI> in or near the <HI>place</HI> where St. <HI>Pauls</HI> now stands, was of their foundation. The <HI>Brittains,</HI> worshipping <HI>Apollo</HI> by the name of <HI>Belinus,</HI> as both <HI>Cambden</HI> and our <HI>Author</HI> say they did, <HI>must</HI> be supposed to have <HI>another name</HI> for <HI>Diana</HI> also, and were more likely to have called her by the name of <HI>Artemis,</HI> her old <HI>Grecian name,</HI> or by some other of as near a resemblance to it, as <HI>Belinus</HI> was to that of <HI>Bel</HI> in the <HI>Eastern Countries.</HI> Assuredly, if that great <HI>City</HI> had received its name from <HI>Diana's Tem∣ple,</HI> the <HI>Welch</HI> being so <HI>tenacious</HI> of their <HI>antient Language,</HI> would have had some remembrance of it, who to this day call it <HI>Lundayn,</HI> and not LLAN-DIAN, according to the <HI>new conceit</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> speaks of.

<P>Now to facilitate this great work of their <HI>Conversion, Cambden</HI> and <HI>Godwin,</HI> two great <HI>Antiquaries,</HI> have alledged one reason, which is not allowed of by our <HI>Author</HI>; and our <HI>Author</HI> hath alledged another reason, which none can al∣low of but himself. The reason alledged by the two great <HI>Antiquaries,</HI> is, that the <HI>Druides did instruct the Brittains in the knowledge of One onely God,</HI> which que∣stionlesse was a great <HI>step</HI> to their <HI>Conversion. Druides unum esse Deum semper in∣culcârunt,</HI> saith our <HI>Author's Margin.</HI> But this he reckoneth a mistake, and thus charitably wisheth thereupon, viz.
<Q>May their mistake herein be as freely forgiven them, as I hope and desire, that the charitable Reader will with his pardon meet those unvoluntary errors, which in this work by me shall be committed.</Q></P>
<P>Whether <HI>all</HI> the errors of our <HI>Author</HI> be <HI>involuntary,</HI> or not, (for I grant that <HI>some</HI> of them may be such) will be seen hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>In good time, Sir.</HI> But till this [<HI>hereafter</HI>] <HI>cometh, Iudge not, lest you be judged</HI>; and think <HI>charitably,</HI> that a <HI>Christian</HI> will not <HI>willingly, wittingly,</HI> and <HI>wilfully run</HI> into <HI>errors.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But whether those two learned Pens were <HI>mistaken</HI> or not, shall be now exa∣mined. I conceive clearly, that they were not <HI>mistaken</HI> in it, it being first improbable, if not impossible, that two Men of such Parts and Learning, and of such eminent integrity in all their Writings, should vent a Proposition, or position rather, which they have no ground for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were <HI>learned Pens</HI> indeed, as ever our Nation bred, in their kind of Studies; and great <HI>Antiquaries.</HI> But onely the * ANTIENT OF DAIES is <HI>Omniscient</HI> and <HI>Infallible.</HI> And I am confident, such was their <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> that they would rather be thankfull to, than angry with any, who, with due respect to their <HI>persons,</HI> should discover their <HI>mistakes.</HI> Amongst which, this was one, that the DRUIDES <HI>instructed the Brittains in the knowledge of one God.</HI></P>
<P>The contrary doth plainly appear by the <HI>testimony</HI> of <HI>Gildas,</HI> lately alledged, whose words are so walled about (as I may say) on both sides, by what went
<PB N="54" REF="32" MS="y"/>
before, and after that, as they cannot be evaded, they cannot be perverted to other reference, than relating unto the Religion of the <HI>antient Brittains,</HI> long before the entrance of the <HI>Romans</HI> into this <HI>Island</HI>; who, besides a <HI>numerous rabblement</HI> of <HI>portentous Idolls,</HI> gave <HI>divine honour</HI> to <HI>Mountains, Hills,</HI> and <HI>Rivers.</HI> Nothing can be more diametrically opposite to the <HI>worship</HI> of <HI>One God,</HI> than such <HI>gross</HI> and <HI>generally diffused Polytheism.</HI></P>
<P>Add to the authority of <HI>Gildas</HI> that of <HI>Origen,</HI> thus writing in his <HI>fourth Ho∣mily</HI> on <HI>Ezekiel.</HI>
<Q>Confitentur &amp; miserabiles Iudaei haec de Christi presentia praedicari; sed stultè ignorant personam, cum videant impleta quae dicta sunt. Quando enim terra Britanniae ante adventum Christi in unius Dei consensit religionem? Quando ter∣ra Maurorum, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>All judicious Readers easily understand this Interrogation, [<HI>When did the Land of</HI> Brittain, <HI>before the comming of Christ, consent in the Religion of one God</HI>?] I say, all do understand, that this his question asked, and left unanswered, amoun∣teth unto a very strong Negation; and, that before the comming of Christ, <HI>Brittain</HI> was divided into the worshipping of many gods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And secondly our Author tells of the <HI>Druides,</HI> that they were <HI>Philosophers, Divines,</HI> and <HI>Lawyers,</HI> to the rest of the <HI>Brittains</HI>; and if Philosophers, they might by their long study in the book of Nature, and their Industrious inquiry into naturall Causes, attaine unto the knowledge of that one and onely Superna∣turall Cause, (as others of the <HI>Heathen Philosophers</HI> in their severall Countries,) from which the works of Nature had their first Originall. And of some other the old <HI>Philosophers,</HI> it is said expresly by <HI>Minutius,</HI> that they had spoken so divinely of the things of God; <HI>ut quivis arbitretur aut nunc Christianos Philoso∣phos esse, aut Philosophos fuisse jam tunc Christianos.</HI> So little was the difference in that particular, between these old <HI>Philosophers</HI> and the <HI>Primitive Christians.</HI> For though they did admit a multitude of Inferiour Gods, <HI>Topical</HI> in respect of Countries, and <HI>Tutelar</HI> in respect of particular Persons; yet in the middle of that darknesse they discerned one Supreme God over all the rest, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as the <HI>Grecians; Hominum Sator atque Deorum,</HI> as the <HI>Latines</HI> call him. And though they were mistaken in the name of that Supream Power, whom generally they entituled by the name of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> yet they did well e∣nough agree in giving him the Supream Power over all the world. <HI>Et qui Iovem principem volunt falluntur in nomine, sed de ea potestate consentiunt,</HI> as my Au∣thor hath it. Nor did those old Philosophers keep the great truth unto them∣selves, like a Candle in a dark-Lanthorn, or <HI>hid under a bushell</HI>; but plac'd it like a great Light on the top of a Mountain, that all the people might discern it; who thereupon lifting their hands unto the Heavens, did frequently make their addresses but to one God onely, saying in common SPEECH unto one another, that <HI>God was great,</HI> and <HI>God was true,</HI> and, <HI>If God permit.</HI> Of which, my Author (the same Christian Advocate) seems to make a question; <HI>Vulgi iste na∣turalis sermo est, an Christiani confitentis oratio?</HI> that is to say, Whether these expressions favoured not rather of the <HI>Christian,</HI> than the vulgar <HI>Heathen.</HI> And hereupon I may conclude in the behalf of the Druides, (or rather of those lear∣ned Pens who affirm it of them) that being <HI>Philosophers</HI> in <HI>Study,</HI> and <HI>Divines</HI> by <HI>Office,</HI> and very eminent in their times in both capacities, they might as well instruct the People in the knowledge of one onely God, as any other of the <HI>Heathen Sages,</HI> either <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans.</HI> The reason alledged by these great <HI>Antiquaries</HI> being thus made good, we next proceed to the examination of that which is produced by our Author.</P>

<P>In this long <HI>Harangue,</HI> I know not what the <HI>Animadvertor aimes at</HI>; this I know, he <HI>hits not</HI> me, nor alledgeth any thing in opposition to what I have
<PB N="55" REF="32" MS="y"/>
written. If he desireth onely to prove, that the <HI>refined Heathens</HI> worshipped one God above all the rest, he shall not onely have my free consent, but the adjection of this my <HI>Symbole</HI> thereunto.</P>
<P>I conceive, that the Pagans adored the <HI>Essence</HI> of <HI>God</HI> under the name of <HI>Iupiter</HI>: and his Attributes under other Titles; <HI>Wisdom,</HI> of <HI>Apollo; Omni-pre∣sence, Swiftnes</HI> of <HI>Mercury; Power,</HI> of <HI>Mars; Beauty,</HI> of <HI>Venus; Providence</HI> over the <HI>Sea, Neptune; Winds, Aeolus; Catile, Pan, &amp;c.</HI> Yet can I not see, how this can excuse them from being foul Idolaters, seeing the morall Commandement doth not say, <HI>Thou shalt not have other gods in equall degree of worship with me</HI>; but, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Exod. 20.3.</NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt not have other gods before me:</HI> and the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> knoweth well, that the Originall importeth, <HI>Coram me,</HI> that is, <HI>Thou shalt have none other in my sight or presence.</HI></P>
<P>Now for quietnesse sake, let the result of this long discourse (so far as I can understand) be granted him, and it amounts to no more, then to put the <HI>Brit∣tains</HI> in the same form with the <HI>Grecians</HI>; instructed by their <HI>Druids</HI> in the wor∣ship of one God, as well and as far as the <HI>Grecians</HI> were in the same Lesson by their <HI>Philosophers.</HI> Now what the <HI>Grecians</HI> held and did in this point, will ap∣pear by the practise of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> whose City was the <HI>Mistris</HI> of <HI>Greece, Staple</HI> of <HI>Learning,</HI> and <HI>Palace</HI> of <HI>Philosophers</HI>; and how well the <HI>Athenians</HI> worshipped one God, we have from the infallible witness of St. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Act. 17.16.</NOTE> <HI>Paul, whose spirit was stirred within him, whilst he saw the City wholly given to idolatry.</HI> Whence it will follow, that the <HI>Brittaines, form-fellowes</HI> with the <HI>Grecians,</HI> were wholly given to Idolatry: which is as much, and more then I said before.</P>
<P>And now the Reader may judge, what progress the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath made in confuting what I have written; yea, less then the Beast <HI>Pigritia</HI> in <HI>Brasil,</HI> which, as he telleth us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his <HI>Mi∣crocosm,</HI> p. 800.</NOTE> elsewhere, goeth not so far in <HI>fourteen</HI> daies, as one may throw a stone. Yea, our <HI>Adversary</HI> hath not gone at all, (save back∣ward) and if he doth not mend his pace, it will be late before he commeth to his lodging.</P>
<P>Here let me mind the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> that my <HI>Church-History</HI> thus begin∣neth; <HI>That we may the more freely and fully pay the tribute of our thanks to Gods goodness, for the Gospell which we now enjoy; let us recount the sad condition of the Brittains, our Predecessors, before the Christian faith was preached unto them.</HI> If there∣fore the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> by his tedious discourse, endeavouring to UN-IDO∣LATRIZE the <HI>Brittains</HI> as much as he could; I say, if hereby he hath hindred or lessened any mans paying of his <HI>thanks</HI> to God, he hath done a <HI>thankless office</HI> both to God and Man therein.</P>

<P>Our Author proceedeth, fol. 3. <HI>It facilitated the entrance of the Gospell hither, that lately the Roman Conquest had in part civilized the South of this Island, by transporting Colonies, and erecting of Cities there.</HI>] Than which, there could not any thing be said more different from the truth of story, or from the time of that Conversion, which we have in hand; performed, as all our latter Writers (and amongst them our Author himself) have affirmed from <HI>Gildas,</HI> who lived in the fourth Century of the Christian Church) <HI>Tempore summo Tiberii Caesa∣ris,</HI> toward the latter end of the Reigne of <HI>Tiberius Cesar,</HI> that is to say, about <HI>thirty seven</HI> years after Christs Nativity, at what time the <HI>Romans</HI> had neither erected any one City, nor planted any one Colony in the South parts of the <HI>Island.</HI> For though <HI>Iulius Cesar,</HI> in pursuance of his <HI>Gallick</HI> Conquest, had at∣tempted this Island, crossed the <HI>Thames,</HI> and pierced as far as <HI>Verulamium,</HI> in the County of the <HI>Cattieuchlani,</HI> (now <HI>Hartfordshire</HI>) yet either finding how difficult a work it was like to prove, or having business of more moment, he gave over the enterprize, resting contented with the honour of the first disco∣very. <HI>Et ostendisse potiùs quàm trad disse,</HI> as we read in <HI>Tacitus.</HI> Nothing done af∣ter this in order to the Conquest of <HI>Brittain,</HI> untill the time of <HI>Claudius.

Of this, see <HI>Tacitus</HI> at large, in the life of <HI>Agricola.</HI> By which it will appear most clearly, that there was neither <HI>City</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI> erection, nor <HI>Co∣lony</HI> of their plantation, till the time of <HI>Claudius,</HI> and consequently no such <HI>fa∣cilitating</HI> of the work, by either of those means which our Author dreams of. But from the Time, proceed we to the Author of this first Conversion, of which thus our Author.</P>

<P>In the first place, know, Reader, that Mr. <HI>Burton,</HI> in his late learned Notes on <HI>Antoninus,</HI> justifieth, that <HI>Iulius Cesar</HI> did <HI>Colonize</HI> (what ever the <HI>Anim∣advertor</HI> saith to the contrary) some part of this Land; otherwise, his whole Conquest would have <HI>unraveled</HI> after his departure, and his Successors had had their work to begin afresh.</P>
<P N="2">2ly. I say not, the <HI>first entrance,</HI> but, the <HI>Entrance</HI> of the Gospell was facilitated by the <HI>Roman</HI> Conquest. The entrance of the Gospell into this <HI>Island</HI> was so far from being done in an instant, or, <HI>simul &amp; semel,</HI> that it was not, <HI>res unius se∣culi, the product of one age</HI>; but was successively done, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>at sundry times, and in divers manners.</HI> So that this <HI>extensive</HI> entrance of the Christian Religion, gradually insinuating it self, took up a <HI>century</HI> of years, from the latter end of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and so forwards.</P>
<P>Christianity entred not into this Island like <HI>Lightning,</HI> but like <HI>light.</HI> None can behold this Essay thereof in the time of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> otherwise then a <HI>mor∣ning-Star</HI>; some forty years after the <HI>day dawned</HI>; and lastly, under King <HI>Lucius,</HI> (that <HI>Leuer-Maure,</HI> or the <HI>great light</HI>) the <HI>Sun</HI> of Religion may be siad to <HI>arise</HI>; before which time, the South of this <HI>Island</HI> was sufficiently Colonized by the <HI>Romans,</HI> whereby <HI>Commerce</HI> and <HI>Civility</HI> ushered <HI>Christianity</HI> into <HI>Brittain.</HI> Yet to clear my words, not from untruth in themselves, but mistakes in others, and to avoid all appearance of falshood, it shall be altered (God-willing) in the next Edition. <HI>It facilitated the entrance and propagation of the Gospell here, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Parsons <HI>the Iesuite mainly stickleth for the Apostle Peter to have first preached the Gospell here.</HI> And our Author doth as mainly stickle against it. The Reason which induced <HI>Parsons</HI> so to stickle in it, was, as our Author thinks and telleth us, fol. 4. <HI>to infer an Obligation of this Island to the See of Rome.</HI> And to exempt this Island from that Obligation, our Author hath endeavoured to disprove the Tradition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the <HI>Iesuite</HI> furiously driveth on that designe▪ appeareth to any that per∣use his Works, and your Author conceiveth his owne <HI>Endeavours lawfull and usefull</HI> in stopping his full <HI>Carrere,</HI> and disobliging the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> from a <HI>Debt</HI> as <HI>uniustly pretended,</HI> as <HI>vehemently prosecuted.</HI>

<L>Your Author for his praise doth pardon crave;</L>
<L>If not despis'd, his praise enough shall have.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is therefore but hard measure, for you to require his good intentions, (if failing in successe) with <HI>contempt</HI> and <HI>reproach.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whereas indeed St. <HI>Peters</HI> preaching in this Island, (if he were the first that preach't here) in the Time of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> must be before his Preaching in the Cit∣ty
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>
of <HI>Rome,</HI> to which he came not till the Reigne of the Emperour <HI>Claudius.</HI> And thereupon it followeth by the <HI>Iesuit's</HI> Logick, that the <HI>Brittains</HI> by spa∣ring their <HI>Apostle</HI> to preach at <HI>Rome,</HI> did lay an Obligation upon that Citty, but received none from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea but if <HI>Simeon</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Metaphra∣stes,</HI> Com∣ment. de Pe∣tro et Paulo ad diem 29. Junij.</NOTE> <HI>Metaphrastes</HI> be to be believed (on whose testimony <HI>Parsons</HI> Principally relieth) being the selfe same Author, whom the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> within few lines hereafter doth so highly commend and extoll, St. <HI>Peter</HI> prea∣ched here, not before, but long after his being at <HI>Rome</HI>; and but a little before his Death, namely in the <HI>twelfth</HI> year of <HI>Nero Cesar.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or granting that St. <HI>Peter</HI> did first preach at <HI>Rome,</HI> yet would this draw up∣on us no such engagement to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as our Author fears; and other <HI>German</HI> Nations by <HI>Boniface, Willibade, Willibad, Willibidd,</HI> and <HI>Swibert,</HI> English <HI>Saxons</HI> all, might or did draw the like Dependance of those Churches, upon this of <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The proportion, I confesse, is Good and well-grounded: but I answer, great the difference betwixt the <HI>Natures</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Rome. England</HI> never pretended <HI>Superiority</HI> over other Churches, which <HI>Rome</HI> doth, prosecuting even <HI>Shadowy pretences</HI> with all <HI>violence.</HI> What the <HI>Talent-hiding servant</HI> said of his <HI>Master,</HI> may be justly said of moderne <HI>Rome, She reapeth where she hath not strowed</HI>; demanding <HI>Officium,</HI> where she never bestow'd <HI>Beneficium,</HI> and requi∣ring <HI>duty</HI> where she never conferred <HI>Courtesie. Rome</HI> therefore being no faire <HI>Creditor,</HI> but so cruell an <HI>Extortioner,</HI> I conceive my paines well imployed, to quit <HI>England</HI> from a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Obligation,</HI> unjustly exacted of her by <HI>Parsons</HI> the <HI>Iesuite,</HI> on the pretence of St. <HI>Peter's</HI> preaching here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So that this fear being overblown, we will consider somewhat further of St. <HI>Peters</HI> first Preaching in this Island, not as deliver'd by Tradition from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is suspected to have pleaded their own Interest in it; but as affirmed positively by the <HI>Greek</HI> Menologies, and in the works of <HI>Simeon Metaphrastes</HI> an approved <HI>Greek</HI> Author. Of the Menologies (though vouched by <HI>Camden</HI> to this purpose) our Author takes no notice at all, but lets the weight of his displeasure fall on <HI>Metaphrastes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best way to over-blow this feare is to confute the <HI>five Arguments</HI> alled∣ged by <HI>Parsons,</HI> for St. <HI>Peters Preaching here,</HI> which I hope is done effectually by me in my <HI>Church-History,</HI> where I follow the <HI>Iesuite</HI> verbatim, in answering to his <HI>Reasons.</HI> And this is the Reason that I took no notice of the <HI>Greek Meno∣logies,</HI> because not mentioned by <HI>Parsons</HI>: whence I collect that either he had never seen them, (which is very improbable,) or else he conceived, that no great beliefe was to be given unto them, or advantage thereby to be gotten for his Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> saith, <HI>Metaphrastes</HI> is an <HI>Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hor</HI> of no <HI>Credit,</HI> as <HI>Baronius</HI> himselfe doth confesse. But first, <HI>Baronius</HI> himselfe makes no such Confession, that which our <HI>Author</HI> tells us from him being onely this, <HI>In alijs multis ibi ab ipso positis errare eum certum est</HI>; that is to say, that he hath err'd in many things by him delivered. Assuredly if to erre in many things delivered in so great a Work, as that of <HI>Simon Metaphrastes,</HI> may forthwith be conceived sufficient to
<PB N="58" REF="34" MS="y"/>
make an <HI>Author</HI> of no <HI>Credit, God blesse</HI> not onely <HI>our Historian,</HI> but <HI>Baronius</HI> him∣selfe from being held <HI>Authors</HI> of no <HI>Credit,</HI> in both whom there are many <HI>Er∣rours</HI> not possible to be reconciled to the <HI>Truth</HI> of <HI>Story.</HI></P>

<P>THREE is a <HI>perfect Number,</HI> let therefore the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> be put in also, partly to make up a <HI>Compleate company</HI>; partly that he may have the <HI>Benefit</HI> of his owne JEAR-PRAYERS to himselfe.</P>
<P><HI>Baronius</HI> being <HI>Dead,</HI> to <HI>pray</HI> for him, is <HI>Popery</HI>; and to take <HI>God's Name in vain</HI> (to Jear us both) is <HI>Prophanenesse.</HI> The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> who now <HI>inserts,</HI> GOD-BLESSE, when it <HI>might</HI> have been <HI>omitted,</HI> will <HI>omit it</HI> when it <HI>should</HI> be <HI>inserted</HI>; as <HI>God willing</HI> I shall take notice of in due time and place hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But secondly, as <HI>Baronius</HI> did not, so he could not say, that <HI>Metaphrastes</HI> was an Author of no credit: the Man being not onely pious, but Learned also, for the times wherein he lived; honoured as a Saint in the Greek Menologies, on the 27. day of November, and graced with a Funeral Oration by <HI>Michael Psellus</HI> a Renouned Scholler, highly extolled by <HI>Balsamon</HI> for his paines and industry in this present work, and no lesse magnified by the Fathers in the Councill of <HI>Florence,</HI> Anno. 1436. All which had never set such an Estimate upon him in their severall Times, had he been an Author of no Credit as our Author makes him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall hereafter have an higher esteem for <HI>Metaphrastes.</HI> However, to re∣turn to the words of <HI>Baronius,</HI> which (in the last Note) gave the occasion of this contest.</P>
<P><HI>In aliis multis</HI> IBI <HI>ab ipso positis errare eum certum est: It is certain that he hath er∣red in many things</HI> THERE <HI>delivered by him.</HI> The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> in his Translati∣on omitteth THERE, the most <HI>emphaticall</HI> word in the whole Sentence, see∣ing, granting <HI>Metaphrastes</HI> a good Author in other things, he is erroneous in this particular.</P>

<P>I had now ended with St. <HI>Peter,</HI> but that I find him appear in a vision to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and telling him, That he had preached the Gos∣pell in <HI>Brittain,</HI> (occasioning thereby the foundation of the <HI>Abbey</HI> of St. <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>Westminster.</HI>) To which our Author makes this answer, <HI>To this vision pretended of Peter, we oppose the certain words of St. Paul,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.1. <HI>Neither give heed to fables.</HI></P>
<P>What a pitty is it, that this apparition was not made, and the same tale told over again, to <HI>Thomas Fuller</HI> of <HI>Hammersmith,</HI> that so it might have found some credit with our Author, though with no body else.</P>

<P>For of this, <HI>Thomas Fuller</HI> our <HI>Author</HI> telleth us, (and telleth it in <HI>confirmation</HI> of some <HI>Miracles</HI> done by King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>sixth</HI> after his decease) that being a <HI>very honest man,</HI> he hapned into the <HI>company</HI> of some who had <HI>stoln</HI> some <HI>Cattle,</HI> for which he was <HI>condemned</HI> and <HI>executed</HI>; and being on the top of the Ladder, King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>sixth</HI> appeared unto him, and so ordered the matter, that he was not strangled with the Rope, but preserved alive: And finally, that in gratitude of so great a benefit, he repaired to that <HI>Kings Tomb</HI> in <HI>Chertsey Abbey,</HI> and there presented his humble thanks for that great deliverance.

<P>Let the Eccho both in Latine and English answer for me, <HI>Ure duos, Burn both,</HI> for a <HI>brace</HI> of notorious falshoods, and see who will shed a tear to quench the fire. As for the <HI>Apparition</HI> to <HI>Thomas Fuller</HI> of <HI>Hammersmith,</HI> seeing afterwards the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> twitteth me therewith, we will till then defer our <HI>Answer</HI> thereunto.</P>

<P>Less opposition meets the preaching of St. <HI>Ioseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea,</HI> though it meeteth some. For notwithstanding that this Tradition be as generall, as universally received, as almost any other in the Christian Church; yet our Author, being resolved to let fly at all, declares it for a piece of <HI>Novel super∣stition, disguis'd with pretended Antiquity.</HI> Better provided (as it seems) to dis∣pute this point than the Ambassadours of <HI>Castile,</HI> when they contended for pre∣cedency with those of <HI>England</HI> in the Council of <HI>Basil</HI>; who had not any thing to object against this Tradition of <HI>Iosephs</HI> preaching to the <HI>Brittains,</HI> although the <HI>English</HI> had provoked them, by confuting their absurd pretences for St. <HI>Iames</HI> his preaching to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never denyed the <HI>Historicall ground-work,</HI> but the <HI>Fabulous varnish</HI> of <HI>Arima∣thean Ioseph</HI> here preaching. My words run thus.
<Q><BIBL><HI>Church-History, Pag. 6. Part 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Yet because the Norman Charters of <HI>Glassenbury</HI> refer to a Succession of many antient Charters, bestowed on that Church by severall <HI>Saxon Kings,</HI> as the <HI>Saxon Charters</HI> relate to <HI>Brittish Grants</HI> in <HI>Intuition</HI> to <HI>Joseph's</HI> being there; We dare not wholly deny the <HI>substance</HI> of the <HI>Story,</HI> though the <HI>Leaven</HI> of <HI>Monkery</HI> hath much swollen and puffed up the <HI>circumstance</HI> thereof.</P></Q></P>
<P>And to the <HI>impartiall peruser</HI> of the <HI>connexion</HI> of my words, <HI>Novell Superstition, disguised with pretended Antiquity,</HI> relate not to the <HI>substance</HI> of the <HI>Story, but as it is presented unto us with fictitious embellishments.</HI></P>
<P>And here I foretell the <HI>Reader,</HI> what he shall see within <HI>few pages</HI> performed, namely, that after the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath <HI>flung,</HI> and <HI>flounced,</HI> and <HI>fluttered</HI> a∣bout, to shew his own <HI>activity</HI> and <HI>opposition,</HI> against what I (though never so well and warily) have written, at last he will <HI>calmly come up,</HI> and in this <HI>con∣troversie</HI> close with my <HI>sense,</HI> though not <HI>words,</HI> using (<HI>for the more credit</HI>) his own expressions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For first, our Author doth object in the way of scorn, that, fol. 6. <HI>The relation is as ill accoutred with tacklings, as the Ship, in which it is affirmed that St.</HI> Phillip, <HI>St.</HI> Jo∣seph, <HI>and the rest, were put by the Iews, into a Vessell without Sails or Oars, with intent to drown them; and being tossed with tempests in the midland Sea, at last safely landed at</HI> Marcelles <HI>in</HI> France, <HI>and thence afterwards made for</HI> England.] No such strange piece of <HI>Errantry</HI> (if we mark it well) as to render the whole <HI>truth</HI> suspected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by way of <HI>scorn,</HI> Sir, but by way of <HI>dislike</HI> and <HI>distrust.</HI> The more <HI>I mark it, the more strange piece of Errantry it seemeth,</HI> so that I cannot meet with a <HI>stranger.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For first, we find it in the Monuments of elder times, that <HI>Acrisius</HI> King of <HI>Argos</HI> exposed his <HI>daughter Danae,</HI> with her young son <HI>Perseus,</HI> in such a vessell as this was, and as ill provided of all necessaries, to the open Seas; who, not∣withstanding,
<PB N="60" REF="35" MS="y"/>
by divine providence, were safely wafted to those parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> which we now call <HI>Puglia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Monuments of elder times!</HI> What be your <HI>Acts,</HI> if these be your <HI>Monuments? Ask my fellow if I be a thief</HI>; ask a Poeticall Fable, if a Monkish Legend be a lyar. And what if <HI>Danae</HI> (the self-same forsooth which had a golden shoure rained into her lap) crossed from <HI>Argos</HI> in <HI>Peloponesus,</HI> to <HI>Apulia,</HI> now <HI>Puglia,</HI> al∣most in a streight line, and the narrowest part of the <HI>Adriatick.</HI> This doth not parallel the improbability of <HI>Ioseph</HI> his voyage, in an un-accoutred Ship, from some <HI>Port</HI> in <HI>Palestine,</HI> to <HI>Marselles,</HI> the way being <HI>ten times</HI> as far, full of <HI>flexures,</HI> and <HI>making of severall points</HI>; which costs our Sea-men some months in sailing, (though better accommodated). I confess, Gods power can bring any, a grea∣ter distance, with <HI>cordage</HI> of <HI>cobweb</HI> in a <HI>nut-shell,</HI> but no wise man will make his belief so cheap, to credit such a miracle, except it be better attested.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And secondly, for the middle times, we have the LIKE story in an <HI>Author above all exception,</HI> even our Author himself, who telleth us, <HI>lib.</HI> 6. <HI>fol.</HI> 265. of our present History, that <HI>King Athelstane</HI> put his brother <HI>Edwin into a little Wherry or Cock-boat, without any tackling or furniture thereunto,</HI> to the end, that if the poor Prince perished, <HI>his wickedness might be imputed to the waves.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks for the jeer premised. I am not the <HI>Author,</HI> but bare <HI>Relater</HI> of that story, obvious in all our <HI>English Chronicles.</HI> Nor is the story LIKE to that of <HI>Io∣seph</HI>'s, except he had been drowned in his Waftage to <HI>Marelles,</HI> as this expo∣sed Prince <HI>Edwin</HI> was in our Narrow Seas, (whether wilfully or casually, not so certain) his corps being taken up in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The resemblance be∣twixt stories chiefly consists in similitude of success; And what likeness betwixt a <HI>miserable death,</HI> and a <HI>miraculous deliverance</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our Author objecteth in the next place, that no <HI>writer of credit can be produced before the Conquest, who mentioneth</HI> Joseph<HI>'s comming hither.</HI>] For answer where∣unto, it may first be said, that where there is a constant uncontrolled Tradi∣tion, there is most commonly the less care taken to commit it to Writing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Less care</HI> implyeth <HI>some care,</HI> whereas here <HI>no care,</HI> but a <HI>pannick silence</HI> of all Authors, <HI>Brittish, Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Christian,</HI> for a <HI>thousand years</HI> together. Second∣ly, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> might have done well, to have instanced in any one Tra∣dition, (seeing he saith it is most commonly done) which is <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>uncon∣trolled,</HI> yet attested by no <HI>creditable Author</HI>; and then let him carry the cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, that the Charters of <HI>Glassenbury,</HI> relating from the <HI>Norman</HI> to the <HI>Sax<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> Kings, and from the <HI>Saxons</HI> to the <HI>Brittains,</HI> being all built upon St. <HI>Ioseph</HI>'s comming hither, and preaching here, may serve instead of many Authors bea∣ring witness to it.</P>
<P>And thirdly, that <HI>Frier Bale,</HI> as great an enemy to the unwarrantable Tra∣ditions of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> as our Author can desire to have him, hath vouch'd two witnesses hereunto, that is to say, <HI>Melkinus Avalonius,</HI> and <HI>Gildas Albanus</HI>; whose Writings, or some fragments of them, he may be believed to have seen, though our Author hath not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor the Animadvertor neither. <HI>Bale</HI> doth not intimate that he ever saw any part of them; and he useth to <HI>Cackle,</HI> when lighting on such Eggs. But we col∣lect from him and other Authors, that no credit is to be given to such <HI>suppo∣sititious fragments.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As for some circumstances in the story, that is to say, the dedicating of <HI>Io∣sephs</HI> first Church to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the burying of his body in it, and the in∣closing of the same with a large Church-yard; I look upon them as the pro∣ducts of Munkish ignorance, accommodated unto the fashion of those times which the writers liv'd in. There is scarce any Saint in all the Calendar, whose History would not be subject to the like misconstructions, if the addita∣ments of the middle and darker times should be produced to the disparage∣ment of the whole Narration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now the <HI>Reader</HI> sees my <HI>Prediction</HI> performed, <HI>viz.</HI> that after the <HI>Animad∣vertor</HI> had <HI>flounced about,</HI> he would <HI>close</HI> with my <HI>sense</HI> in <HI>his owne words.</HI> Is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this the very <HI>same in effect</HI> with what I said, approving the <HI>Substance,</HI> but reject∣ing the <HI>Fabulous circumstances</HI> of the <HI>story</HI> of <HI>Ioseph?</HI> In all this he hath done just nothing, save onely <HI>swelled</HI> his <HI>Book,</HI> (though hollow within) to make it amount to a <HI>Saleable bignesse.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But such an Enemy <HI>Our Author</HI> is to all <HI>old Traditions,</HI> that he must needs have a blow at <HI>Glassen-bury Thorne,</HI> though before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut down by some Souldiers, as himselfe confesseth; like Sir <HI>Iohn Falstaffe</HI> in the Play, who to shew his Va∣lour, must thrust his sword into the Bodies of those men which were dead be∣fore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to <HI>all old Traditions,</HI> good <HI>Animadvertor. Saint Paul</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Thessal. 2.15.</NOTE> saith, <HI>Hold the Tra∣ditions which you have been taught whether by Word, or our Epistle</HI>: such <HI>Traditions</HI> as these, whether in <HI>Doctrine</HI> or <HI>Practice,</HI> I desire to retaine. As for <HI>unwitnessed Traditions,</HI> my Emnity is not such, but in the heat thereof I can smile at them. The Animadvertor hath wronged me, and, The <HI>Comedian</HI> hath wronged Sir <HI>Iohn Falstaffe.</HI> He was a valiant Knight, famous for his Atcheivements in <HI>France,</HI> made (as the <HI>History</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pag. 329.</NOTE> <HI>of St. George</HI> testifieth,) <HI>Knight</HI> of the <HI>Garter</HI> by <HI>King Henry</HI> the <HI>Sixt,</HI> and one who disdained to violate the Concerments of the Dead. Nor have I been injurious to the <HI>Thorne</HI> of <HI>Glassenbury living or Dead,</HI> as will appeare.</P>

<P>The budding or blossoming of which <HI>Thorne,</HI> he accounts untrue (<HI>which, were it true, &amp;c. Fol.</HI> 8.) affirming, from I know not whom, <HI>that it doth not punctually and critically bud on Christmas Day, but on the dayes neare it and about it.</HI> And were it no otherwise then so, the Miracle were not much the lesse, then if it budded critically on <HI>Christmas Day,</HI> as I have heard from persons of great Worth and credit dwelling neare the place, that indeed it did: though unto such, as had a mind to decry the Festival, it was no very hard matter to <HI>belie</HI> the Miracle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>My words amount not to an absolute <HI>Denial,</HI> but to some <HI>Dissatisfaction. Par∣cel-Diffidelity</HI> in matters of such nature, I am sure is no sin. <HI>Mr. Taylor,</HI> burges for Bristol in the long Parliament, was He who told me, that going thither pur∣posely with his Kinsman it did not that year exactly bud on <HI>Christmas</HI> Day. A Person as improbable to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry the <HI>Festival,</HI> being a Colonel on the Kings side,
<PB N="62" REF="36" MS="y"/>
(who refusing quarter was killed under the walles of Bristol); so unlikely, if living, to have taken the LYE from the Pen of the <HI>Animadvertor.</HI></P>
<P>And now Reader, (seeing some mirth will not be amisse) know that, As I do not believe his report, who on a <HI>Christmas day,</HI> stroaking his Hand down his Doublet before, found there a great green <HI>Quick-Set</HI> suddenly grown, and Wondred thereat, untill he remembred, that the <HI>moulds</HI> of his <HI>Bald-worne but∣tens</HI> were made of <HI>Glassen-bury Thorne</HI>: so am I not of so sullen and Morose a Nature, as not to Credit what is generally and Credibly reported. Nor do my words Positively and Peremptorily conclude against the <HI>budding</HI> of this <HI>Thorne,</HI> but against the necessary relating thereof, to <HI>Arimathean Ioseph,</HI> which I rather leave at large to some occult Quality in nature, paralleling it with the like, (never as yet fathered on any Saint the causer thereof,) the <HI>Oake</HI> in <HI>Ham∣shire.</HI> But enough, lest we occasion the altering of the Proverb from <HI>de Lana Caprina,</HI> into <HI>de Corno Glastoniensi.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In fine, our Author either is unwilling to have the Gospell as soon preach't here as in other places, or else we must have preachers for it from he knowes not whence. Such preachers we must have, as either drop down immediately from the Heavens, as <HI>Diana</HI>'s Image is said to have done by the Towne-Clark of <HI>Ephesus</HI>; or else must suddenly rise out of the earth, as <HI>Tages</HI> the first Sooth-sayer amongst <HI>Thuscans,</HI> is reported to have done by some antient Writers. And yet we cannot say of our Author neither, as <HI>Lactantius</HI> did of one <HI>Acesilas</HI> (if my memory fail not,) <HI>Recte hic aliorum sustulit disciplinas, sed non rectè fundavit suam</HI>; that is to say, that though he had laid no good grounds for his own opinion, yet he had solidly confuted the opinions of others. Our Author hath a way by himselfe, neither well skill'd in pulling down, or in building up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>have plucked</HI> nothing dovvn but vvhat vvould have <HI>fallen</HI> of it selfe, and thereby perchance hurt others, (I meane mis-inform them) as grounded on a foundred foundation.

<P>This is enough to satisfie any ingenuous person, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eferreth <HI>a modest truth</HI> before <HI>adventurous assertions,</HI> having in them much of fals-ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and more of un∣certainty.</P>

<P>From the first conversion of the <HI>Brittains,</HI> proceed we now unto the second, as <HI>Parsons</HI> cals it, or rather from the first Preaching to the Propagation. The Christian Faith here planted by St. <HI>Peter</HI> or St. <HI>Ioseph</HI> (or perhaps planted by the one, and watered by the other, in their severall times) had still a being in this Island till the time of <HI>Lucius.</HI> So that there was no need of a new Con∣version, but onely of some able Labourers to take in the Harvest. The Mira∣cles done by some pious Christians induced King <HI>Lucius</HI> to send <HI>Elvanus</HI> and <HI>Meduinus</HI> (two of that profession) to the Pope of <HI>Rome, requesting principally,</HI> that some Preachers might be sent <HI>to instruct him in the saith of Christ.</HI> Which the <HI>Pope</HI> did according to the Kings desire, sending <HI>Faganus</HI> and <HI>Derwianus,</HI> two right godly men, by whom much people were converted, the Temples of the gods converted into Christian Churches, the Hierarchy of Bishops setled, and the whole building raised on so good a foundation, that it continued undemo∣lisht till the time of the <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the Sum and Substance of the Story of K. <HI>Lucius,</HI> which the Ani∣madvertor hath breviated, and with whom I concurre therein. It never came into my thoughts to doubt the <HI>substance,</HI> but deny some circumstances thereof. My owne <NOTE PLACE="marg">Church Hist. v. 1. pag. 10.</NOTE> expression is, that the whole Bulk thereof is not to be <HI>Refused,</HI> but <HI>Refined,</HI> and to this I adhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And in the summing up of this story, our Author having refuted some petit Arguments which had been answered to his hand (though much mistaken by the way in taking <HI>Diotarus</HI> King of <HI>Galatia,</HI> for a King of <HI>Sicilie,</HI> fol. 10.) gives us some other in their stead, which he thinks unanswerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny not that P. <HI>Eleutherius</HI> might or did send a Letter to K. <HI>Lucius,</HI> but I justly suspect the Letter novv extant to be but-pretended and forged. I ne∣ver thought (by the vvay, hovv came the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> to knovv my thoughts,) my Arguments <HI>unanswerable,</HI> but now I say they are <HI>unanswered</HI>; standing in full force, notvvithstanding any alledged by the Animadvertor to the contrary. I confesse a <HI>Memory-mistake</HI> of <HI>Sicilia</HI> for <HI>Galatia</HI>: and as it is the first fault he hath detected in my Book; so shall it be the first by me (God Willing) amen∣ded in the next Edition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our Author First objects against the Popes answer to the King, that</P>
<P>Fol. 11. <HI>It relates to a former letter of King</HI> Lucius <HI>wherein he requested of the</HI> Pope <HI>to send him a Copy or Collection of the</HI> Roman <HI>Lawes, which being at that time in force in the Ile of</HI> Britain, <HI>was but</HI> actum agere.] But certainly though those parts of <HI>Brittain</HI> in which <HI>Lucius</HI> reign'd, were governed in part (and but in part) by the Lawes of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet were the Lawes of <HI>Rome,</HI> at that time more in num∣ber, and of a far more generall practice, then to be limited to so narrow a part of their Dominions. Two thousand Volumes we find of them in <HI>Iustinians</HI> time, out of which, by the help of <HI>Theophilus, Trebonianus,</HI> and many other lear∣ned men of that noble faculty, the Emperour compos'd that Book or body of Law which from the universality of its comprehension, we still call the <HI>Pan∣dects.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>One who hath taken but two <HI>Turnes</HI> in <HI>Trinity hall Court</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> knowes full well what PANDECTS are, and why so called. All this is but <HI>praefatory</HI>: I waite for the answer to the Objection still to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the next place it is objected, that</P>
<P><HI>This letter mounts King</HI> Lucius <HI>to too high a Throne, making him the Monarch or King of</HI> Britain, <HI>who neither was the Supreme nor sole King here, but partial and sub∣ordinate to the</HI> Romans.] This we acknowledge to be true, but no way preju∣diciall to the cause in hand. <HI>Lucius</HI> both was and might be call'd the King of <HI>Britain,</HI> though Tributary and Vassal to the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, as the two <HI>Baliols Iohn</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> were both Kings of <HI>Scotland,</HI> though Homagers and Vassals to <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and third, of <HI>England,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Naples</HI> to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and those of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Bohemia</HI> to the <HI>German</HI> Emperors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>A <HI>Blank</HI> is better then such <HI>writing to no purpose.</HI> For first, both the <HI>Baliols</HI> in their severall times were (though not SUPREME) SOLE <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Scotland.</HI> So
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
were the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> (there never being but <HI>one,</HI> the first, and Last, viz. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Seb. Munste∣rus de Germa∣nia.</NOTE> <HI>Fredoritus Leopoldus</HI>) and the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> in their respective <HI>Dominions.</HI> Not so <HI>Lucius,</HI> who was neither <HI>Supreme</HI> nor <HI>Sole King</HI> of <HI>Brittain.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Baliols</HI> being <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> did never Style themselves, (or were Styled by other) <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Brittaine.</HI> The <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> never entituled themselves <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI>: Nor the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Bohemia</HI> ever wrote themselves, (or were written to,) as <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas <HI>Lucius,</HI> (<HI>Ruler</HI> onely in the <HI>South West-part</HI> of this <HI>Isle,</HI>) is in this Letter made <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Brittain,</HI> more then came to his share; an Argument that the <HI>Forger</HI> thereof was unacquainted with the <HI>Constitution</HI> of his <HI>Kingdom.</HI> And this just Exception stands firme against the <HI>Letter,</HI> what ever the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath alledged in the excuse thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor doth the next objection give us any trouble at all, that is to say, that</P>
<P><HI>The Scripture quoted in that Letter is out of St.</HI> Hieroms <HI>Translation, which came more then a hundred years after</HI>:] Unless it can be prov'd withall (as I think it cannot) that <HI>Hierom</HI> followed not, in those Texts, those old Translations, which were before receiv'd and used in the Western Churches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>See the different tempers of men, how some in point of Truth, are of a ten∣derer constitution than others. The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">De prim Ec.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lesle am I mov'd with that which follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That this letter not appearing till a thousand years after the death of</HI> Pope <HI>Eleuthe∣rius, might probably creep out of some Monks Cell, some four hundred years since.</HI>] Which allegation being admitted, (the Monks Cell excepted,) it makes no more to the discredit of the letter which we have before us, then to the under∣valuing of those excellent Monuments of Piety and Learning, which have been recovered of late times from the dust and moths of ancient Libraries. Such Treasures like money long lock't up, is never thought lesse profitable when it comes abroad. And from what place soever it first came abroad, I am confi∣dent it came not out of any Monks Cell; that generation being then wholly at the Popes devotion, by consequence not likely to divulge an Evidence, so ma∣nifestly tending to the overthrow of his pretensions. The Popes <HI>about four hun∣dred years since</HI> were mounted to the height of that power and Tyranny which they claimed as Vicars unto Christ. To which there could not any thing be more plainly contrary then that passage in the Pope's letter, whereto he tells the King, <HI>That he was Gods Vicar in his owne Kingdom</HI> (vos estis Vicarius Dei in Regno vestro, as the Latin hath it.) Too great a secret to proceed <HI>from the Cell of a Monk,</HI> who would have rather forg'd ten Decretals to uphold the Popish usurpations over Soveraign Princes, then published one onely (whether true or false) to subvert the same. Nor doth this Letter onely give the King an empty Title, but such a Title as imports the exercise of the chief Ecclesiastical Power within his Dominions. For thus it followeth in the same; <HI>The people and the folk of the Realm of</HI> Britain <HI>be yours, whom if they be divided, ye ought to gather in concord and peace, to call them to the</HI> faith <HI>and</HI> law <HI>of Christ, to cherish and maintain them, to rule and govern them, so as you may reign everlastingly with him whose</HI> Vicar <HI>you are.</HI> So far the very words of the letter, as our Author rendereth them, which savour far more of the honest simplicity of the Primitive <HI>Popes,</HI> then the impostures and supposititious issues of the latter times.</P>

<P>I confesse some pretious pieces of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> long <HI>Latent</HI> in <HI>Obscurity,</HI> have at last broke forth into the <HI>Light,</HI> with no little <HI>advantage</HI> to <HI>Learning.</HI> But then such were <HI>intire Books,</HI> and we know, how, when, where, and by whom, they were found out, and brought forth. Whereas this <HI>loose Letter</HI> secretly and slily slid into the <HI>World,</HI> unattended with any such <HI>Cicumstances</HI> to attest the <HI>Genuinesse</HI> thereof. Children casually lost, are no whit the <HI>lesse Legitimate</HI>; and <HI>beloved</HI> the more, when found and owned of their <HI>Parents.</HI> But give me leave to suspect that <HI>Babe</HI> a <HI>Bastard,</HI> which is left on a <HI>bulk,</HI> or under a <HI>Stall</HI>; no <HI>Father</HI> being found, or <HI>Mother,</HI> to maintaine it. A <HI>Presumption</HI> that this <HI>Letter</HI> of <HI>Elu∣therius</HI> is <HI>supposititious.</HI></P>
<P>I confesse, this pretended Letter of <HI>Lucius</HI> hath something in it, which doth <HI>act and personate primitive simplicity,</HI> (as that passage of Regal power in Church-matters,) but more which doth <HI>practise the Monkish ignorance,</HI> of later times. There were lately false twenty Shilling pieces, (commonly called <HI>Morgans</HI>) coyned by a cunning and cheating Chymist, whose part without the <HI>Rind</HI> was <HI>good Gold,</HI> and would endure the touch, whilst that within was base as but <HI>double guilded Brasse.</HI> Such, this Letter of <HI>Lucius</HI>; some part whereof will endure the <HI>Test,</HI> the other not: the Monk, who made it, pretending something of anti∣quity, (so to palliate the deceit); but having more of the Novelty of the middle age. He lived in some six hundred years since.</P>
<P>May the Reader be pleased to take notice, that the Animadvertor hath silently passed by, the strongest Argument to shatter the credit of this Letter alledged by me, and taken from a phrase unknown in that Age, yet used in the <HI>Letter,</HI> even MANU TENERE, to <HI>Maintain,</HI> or defend. This the Animadver∣tor slips over in silence, and that I believe for <HI>nineteen reasons,</HI> whereof this was one, because He himselfe was unable to answer it, and knew <HI>Criticks</HI> would laugh at him, if affirming those words, in that sense, contemporary with Pope <HI>Eleutherius.</HI> Herein, He appears like a <HI>Dunkerker,</HI> who delights to prey on poore Marchants Ships passing on in their Calling, but meeting an <HI>English Man of War,</HI> He can <HI>look Big,</HI> and fairly <HI>give him the goe-By.</HI> He finds it more facile to <HI>carpe</HI> an easie inoffensive passage, then to <HI>confute</HI> what hath difficulty, and strength of reason therein.</P>
<P>I resume what I <HI>said</HI> before, and what the Animadvertor hath <HI>gain-said</HI> to no purpose, <HI>viz.</HI> that this Story of K. <HI>Lucius</HI> is not to be <HI>Refused</HI> but <HI>Refined,</HI> and the <HI>drosse</HI> is to be put from the good <HI>Metall</HI>; or (as my own words also are,) the good Corn therein sifted from the <HI>Chaffe</HI>; and, amongst the <HI>Chaffe,</HI> I have cast away this <HI>Letter.</HI> But if the Animadvertor <HI>loves</HI> to eat both <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Chaffe,</HI> much good may his Diet do him, and let Him and Horse feed on their Loafe together.</P>

<P>And it is well they do but <HI>seem</HI> so, it being possible enough that they may <HI>seem Falshoods</HI> to our Author, <HI>even notorious Falshoods</HI>; though they seem true enough to others, even apparent Truths.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And first though <HI>Ieffery</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> seem to deserve no credit in this par∣ticular, where he speaks against our Author's sense; yet in another place where he comes up to his Desires, he is otherwise thought of, and therefore made the Fore-man of the Grand-inquest against <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk, whom he enditeth for the Murther of the Monks of <HI>Bangor.</HI> And certainly, if <HI>Ieffery</HI> may be be∣lieved when he speaks in Passion, <HI>when his Welch-Blood was up,</HI> as our Author words it, as one that was <HI>concerned in the Cause of his Country-Men</HI>; he may more easily be believed in a Cause of so remote Antiquity, where neither Love nor Hatred, or any other prevalent Affection had any power or reason to di∣vert him from the Way of Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is usuall with all <HI>Authors,</HI> sometimes to <HI>close</HI> with the <HI>Iudgments</HI> of the same <HI>Person,</HI> from whom they afterwards on just Cause may <HI>dissent</HI>; and should not this Liberty be allowed me, to like or leave, in <HI>Ieffery Monmouth,</HI> what I think fitting? The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> concurreth with <HI>Bishop God-win,</HI> that the DRUIDES <HI>instructed the Britons in the worship of one God</HI>; yet will not be con∣cluded with his <HI>Iudgement,</HI> when averring the <HI>Letter fathered on Eleutherius</HI> not to savour of the Style of that Age. Yea, when I make for him, he can alledge twenty Lines together, out of my Book, against <HI>H. le Strange</HI>; though at other times, when he hath served his Turne of me, I am the Object of his sleighting and Contempt.</P>
<P>Now when as the IN-ANIMADVERTOR (for now I must so call him for his <HI>Carelesnesse,</HI>) citeth a place in my Book, <HI>viz.</HI> [<HI>Lib.</HI> 2. Fol. 63.] that I make J. <HI>Monmouth</HI> the <HI>Foreman</HI> of the great <HI>inquest</HI> against <HI>Augustine</HI> the <HI>Monk,</HI> he is much mistaken therein. For in the place by him cited, I <HI>Impannell</HI> a <HI>Grand Iury,</HI> (amongst whom J. <HI>Monmouth</HI> is neither <HI>Fore-man,</HI> nor <HI>any Man</HI>) of <HI>Iudici∣ous Readers</HI> consisting of twenty four. As false is it what he addeth, as if in that Triall I attributed much to the judgment of J. <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who therein is one∣ly produced as a <HI>Witnesse,</HI> and a <HI>Verdict</HI> brought in, <HI>point-Blank</HI> against his Evi∣dence, <HI>acquitting Augustine</HI> the <HI>Monk</HI> of the <HI>Murther,</HI> whereof <HI>Monmouth</HI> did <HI>accuse</HI> him.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And secondly, though <HI>Ieffery</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> be a Writer of no great credit with me, when he stands single by himselfe; yet when I find him seconded and confirmed by others, I shall not brand a truth by the name of falshood, because he reports it. Now that in <HI>Brittain</HI> at that time there were no fewer then eight and twenty Cities, is affirmed by <HI>Beda. Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntington</HI> not only agrees with him in the number, but gives us also the names of them, though where to find many of them it is hard to say. That in each of these Cities was some Temple dedicated to the Pagan Gods, that those Temples afterwards were im∣ploy'd to the use of Christians, and the Revenues of them assign'd over to the maintenance of the Bishops and other Ministers of the Gospel, hath the concur∣rent testimony of approved Authors; that is to say, <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> out of <HI>Gildas,</HI> Anno 187. <HI>Rodolph de Diceto,</HI> cited by the learned Primat of <HI>Armach</HI> in
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>
his Book <HI>De Primordiis Eccles. Brit.</HI> cap. 4. <HI>Gervase</HI> of <HI>Tilbury,</HI> ibid. cap. 6. And for the <HI>Flamines,</HI> and <HI>Arch-flamines,</HI> they stand not onely on the credit of <HI>Ieffery</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> but of all our owne Writers, who speak of the foundation of the antient Bishopricks, even to <HI>Polydor Virgil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I concurre with the Animadvertor in the number of the Citties in Brittain.</P>
<P>Also I do not deny but that K. <HI>Lucius</HI> might place Bishops in <HI>some</HI> (perchance <HI>half</HI>) of them, which I believe is all which the Animadvertor doth desire. On∣ly as to <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Arch-bishops</HI> exactly substituted in the <HI>Individual places</HI> of <HI>Flamens</HI> and <HI>Arch-flamens,</HI> my <HI>beliefe</HI> cannot come up to the height thereof. I find that <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> and other Authors of that age, (though concur∣ring with J. <HI>Monmouth</HI> in <HI>Lucius</HI> his <HI>Episcopating</HI> of Citties,) make not any mention of these <HI>Arch-flamens.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor want there many forrain Writers who affirm the same, beginning with <HI>Martinus Polonus,</HI> who being esteemed no friend to the Popedom (because of the Story of <HI>Pope Ione</HI> which occurs in his Writings) may the rather be believ'd in the story of <HI>Lucius.</HI> And he agrees with <HI>Ieffery</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> in all parts of the story, as to the <HI>Flamines</HI> and <HI>Arch-flamines,</HI> as do also many other of the <HI>Roman</HI> Writers which came after him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more usuall then for forrain Writers, with <HI>implicite faith,</HI> to take things on the credit of such who have wrote the History of their own Country. But on the Confutation of the <HI>Leading Author,</HI> the rest sink of course of them∣selves.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But where both our Author and some others have rais'd some objections against this part of the <HI>History,</HI> for Answer thereunto I refer the Reader to the learned and laborious Work of <HI>Francis Mason</HI> late Archdeacon of <HI>Norfolk, De Ministerio Anglicano,</HI> the sum whereof in brief is this, <HI>Licet in una urbe multi Fla∣mines,</HI> that though there were many <HI>Flamines</HI> in one City, yet was there onely one which was called <HI>Pontifex</HI> or <HI>Primus Flaminum</HI>; the Pope or principall of the <HI>Flamines</HI>; of which kind one for every City, were those whom our Histori∣ans speak of. And for the <HI>Archi-Flamines</HI> or <HI>Proto-Flamines,</HI> though the name occurre not in old <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, yet were there some in power and Autho∣rity above the rest, who were entituled <HI>Primi Pontificum</HI> (as indeed <HI>Coifi</HI> by that name is called in <HI>Beda</HI>) which is the same in sense with <HI>Arch-flamines</HI> although not in sound. All I shall further add is this, that if these 28 Cities were not all furnished with Bishops in the time of <HI>Lucius,</HI> for vvhom it vvas impossible to spread his armes and expresse his power over all the South parts of the Island; yet may the honour of the vvork be ascribed to him, because begun by his encouragement, and perfected by his example; as <HI>Romulus</HI> is generally esteem∣ed for the Founder of <HI>Rome,</HI> although the least part of that great City vvas of his Foundation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, whereas both the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> and some others conceive their <HI>Answers</HI> satisfactory to such Objections raised against this part of the History; I refer the Reader unto Sr. <HI>Henry</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his <HI>Coun∣cels.</HI></NOTE><HI>Spelman,</HI> and to the Arch-bishop of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his <HI>Pri∣mord.

<P>These it seemes were not satisfied, with such <HI>Solutions,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> pro∣duceth against those Objections, because (writing later than Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>) they in their judgments declare themselves against J. <HI>Monmouth</HI> herein.</P>

our Author unto that of <HI>Amphibalus,</HI> in prosecution whereof he telleth us of a great slaughter of <HI>Christians</HI> in or near the City of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> from thence so de∣nominated, of vvhich thus saith he;</P>
<P>Fol. 19. <HI>This relation is favoured by the name of</HI> Litchfield, <HI>which in the</HI> British <HI>tongue signifies a</HI> Golgotha, <HI>or a place bestrewed with skuls.</HI>] It's true indeed that <HI>Litchfield,</HI> or <HI>Licidfield,</HI> as <HI>Bedae</HI> calleth it, is made by <HI>Iohn Rosse</HI> to signifie <HI>Ca∣daverum Campus,</HI> or the field of dead bodies. But that it doth so signifie in the <HI>British</HI> language, I do more then doubt, the termination of the vvord be∣ing meerly <HI>Saxon,</HI> as in <HI>Hefensield, Cock-field, Camps-field,</HI> and many others. As little am I satisfied in the <HI>Etymon</HI> of the name of <HI>Maiden-head,</HI> which he ascribes unto the worshipping of the head of one of those many Mai∣dens vvhich vvere martyred with <HI>Ursula</HI> at <HI>Colen,</HI> fol. 36. For vvhich though he cite <HI>Camden</HI> for his Author (following therein, but not approving the old Tradition) yet vvhen I find in the same <HI>Camden,</HI> that this Town was formerly called <HI>Maiden-hith,</HI> that anciently there vvas a ferry near the place vvhere the Town now stands, and that <HI>Hith</HI> in the old <HI>Saxon</HI> tongue, did signifie a Wharf, Haven, or landing place, I have some reason to believe, that the Town took this name from the Wharf or Ferry belonging at that time to some neighbouring <HI>Nunnery,</HI> or to some private Maidens dwelling thereabout, vvho then received the profits of it. Just so, <HI>Queen-Hith</HI> in <HI>London</HI> took that appellation, because the profits of that Wharf vvere antiently accompted for, to the Queens of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>; and <HI>Maiden-bradly</HI> in <HI>Wilshire,</HI> vvas so denominated because belonging to one of the inheretrices of <HI>Manasses Basset,</HI> a most noble personage in his time, who founded a House here for <HI>Maiden Lepers.</HI></P>

<P>Nothing more usuall, than for the same vvord to bear <HI>parly par pale,</HI> two languages. But such mixtures onely are made in such places, vvhere those two Languages have entred common together.</P>
<P>And this is the reason that disapproveth the probability of <HI>Cern-el,</HI> because Hebrew and Latine never incorporated together, Greek, as I may say, being interposed betwixt them.</P>
<P>But such Conjunctions of two Languages, vvhich, in some sort, indented one another, are frequent and familiar.</P>
<P>Our Author lately presented us vvith two half-Greek, half-Latine Archi-flamens, and Proto-flamens.</P>
<P>He also just now mentioned a vvord half<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>French, half Saxon, Camps-field.</P>

<P><HI>As touching the Elymology of the City of</HI> Litchfield, <HI>I can give you no satisfactory accompt; being not well skill'd in the Saxon Tongue. But if Mr.</HI> John Rosse <HI>hath ground for his</HI> Campus Cadaverum, <HI>I conceive he deduced it from the British Tongues and Saxon. For in our Brittish language,</HI> Llaith <HI>signifies death, as may be seen in severall antient Brittish Authors, as</HI> Taliefin <HI>and others.</HI> Lleithfa <HI>may well bear a place of slaugh∣ter as wel as</HI> lladdfa; <HI>the word</HI> lladd <HI>in the Brittish is the same with</HI> occidere <HI>in the La∣tine,</HI> ma <HI>and</HI> Man, <HI>denotes a place: and</HI> ma, <HI>being joyned with</HI> lleith <HI>or</HI> lladd, <HI>the</HI> m <HI>by the rules of the Brittish language turns into</HI> f <HI>as</HI> lladdfa lleithfa lladdfaes.

<P>Our Author proceeds, Fol. 20. <HI>I fear that learned pen hath gone too far, who makes him founder of a</HI> Bishoprick <HI>at</HI> York, <HI>and styleth him an Emperour surpassing in all virtue and Christian piety.</HI>] The learned pen here spoken of, is that of judici∣ous <HI>Camden,</HI> whose character of <HI>Constantius Chlorus</HI> our Author in this place will not let passe without some censure. That he did found (or rather re-found) a Bishoprick in the City of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ork,</HI> I am confident <HI>Cambden</HI> had not said without very good grounds, though on what grounds he said it, I am yet to seek. A Bishoprick and a Bishop of <HI>York</HI> we find on good Record within few years after; <HI>Eborius</HI> the Bishop of that City subscribing to the Councill of <HI>Arles</HI> in the time of <HI>Constantine,</HI> the Son and next successor of <HI>Constantius Chlorus.</HI> And that he was a Prince of surpassing virtue, is generally agreed upon by all Historians, both <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Christians.</HI> The Question then will be onely this, Whether he did <HI>surpass</HI> also in <HI>Christian piety,</HI> which our Author will not otherwise grant, but by our Saviours Argument onely, concluding <HI>those to be on our part who are not against us</HI>; Constantius <HI>doing no other good unto</HI> Christianity, <HI>but that he did not do it harm.</HI> A censure not agreeable to so good an Emperour, who though he were no <HI>through-paced Christian,</HI> yet did he both favour their Religion, and protect their persons, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> testifies <HI>de vita Constantini, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. And not so onely, but as our Author himselfe confesseth, he <HI>both permitted and preser∣ved them who would rebuild the decayed Christian Churches.</HI> If to preserve the per∣sons of Christians in the exercise of their Religion, to have them near unto him in places of greatest trust and eminence, to suffer them to rebuild their Churches and defend them in it, be not the <HI>doing of some good unto Christianity,</HI> more then the <HI>doing it no harm,</HI> let our Author carry it, and <HI>Cambden</HI> bear the blame of his needlesse Courtship.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>If at the end of this <HI>long Note, the Animadvertor</HI> at Last had demonstrated that <HI>Constantius Chlorus</HI> was a <HI>thorow-paced</HI> Christian; the Reader, and I my selfe, would not have grudged our attention unto it.</P>
<P>But what is the <HI>Total sum</HI> of what he saith? It amounts to just nothing, only to show that (which I confessed) he did some <HI>good</HI> (besides no <HI>hurt</HI>) to Christi∣anity. What is this to prove the words of Learned, (but here mistaken) Mr. <HI>Camden.</HI>
<Q>An Emperour surpassing in all Virtues and Christian Piety.</Q></P>
<P>The Animadvertor should first have proved that this Constantius had <HI>passed</HI> into <HI>Christianity</HI> before he was <HI>surpassing therein</HI>; a thing which He, and all his Friends, are never able to evidence by any authentick Author.</P>
<P>In a word, As <HI>Chlorus</HI> or YELLOW (so his Name in Greek) is a <HI>Middle colour</HI> betwixt <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black,</HI> below the former, and above the latter in <HI>Brightnesse</HI>; So this Emperour, (well answering his name,) was indeed much better than

<P>But this is not the first time, in which our Author hath clasht with <HI>Camden,</HI> and I see it will not be the last, by that which followeth. For speaking on the <HI>by</HI> how.

And yet he cannot chuse but know that those whom he doth pass so slightly over by the name of <HI>some</HI> (as if not worthy to be notified by their proper names) are the most eminent and renowned Antiquaries of these latter times. Amongst which if I reckon <HI>Camden</HI> for one, and a chief one too, I should but do him right, and not wrong the rest. Whose arguments to prove the point; he that lists to see, may find them at large laid down in his description of <HI>Kent</HI>; which when our Author can confute (as I doubt he cannot) he may then slight it over as a thing <HI>conceived,</HI> and <HI>conceived</HI> only by <HI>some</HI> men not worth the naming.

<P>Perchance <HI>Guy of Warwick</HI> may be made one of the nine <HI>English worthies.</HI> But I believe none ever made him one of the NINE GENERALL WORTHYES little known beyond the Seas, no General [not to say <HI>Prince</HI>] as the rest of his <HI>Form-fellowes,</HI> and fam'd onely for his personal performances.</P>

<P>The words of the Animadvertor <HI>in common estimate</HI> intimate, that they are not <HI>constantly</HI> so accounted.

<P>In the description whereof, he omitteth that which was indeed their greatest unhappiness, that is to say, their barbarous and inhumane sacrifices of men and women unto two of their Idols. For <HI>Camden</HI> telleth us of their god called <HI>Wooden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camd. in Brit. fol.</HI> 135.</NOTE> that <HI>they used to procure his favour by sacrificing unto him men a∣live:</HI> And I have read in <HI>Verstegan</HI> (if my memory fail not) a man inferiour to none, in the Antiquities of this Nation, that at their return from any conquest, they us'd to sacrifice the noblest of their Captives to their Idol <HI>Thur.</HI> In this not much inferior to the <HI>Palestinians,</HI> in their sacrifices to <HI>Moloch</HI>; or to the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> in the like abominable sacrifices to <HI>Saturn</HI>; or to the <HI>Scythians,</HI> in the like to <HI>Diana Taurica</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lactant. lib.</HI> 16 <HI>cap.</HI> 21.</NOTE> or finally, to the <HI>Galls,</HI> in theirs to <HI>Haesus</HI> and <HI>Teutate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> their own National Deities.

<P>See here the signal <HI>Charity</HI> of the <HI>Animadvertor!</HI> After he had <HI>layed</HI> the charge as heavy as he could, (and <HI>heavier</HI> than he <HI>should</HI>) he candidly comes off, he <HI>will not lay to my charge such</HI> small faults of <HI>Omission.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For making a general muster of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Gods, and shewing how they were dispos'd of in relation to the dayes of the week, he concludes it thus: Fol. 55. <HI>And thus we see the whole week bescattered with</HI> Saxon <HI>Idols, whose Pagan gods were the God-fathers of the dayes, and gave them their names.</HI>] Not the <HI>whole week,</HI> though the greatest part thereof was thus bescattered. <HI>Sun∣day</HI> and <HI>Munday</HI> being so call'd in reference to the Sun and Moon, or else in cor∣respondence to the names of <HI>Dies Solis</HI> and <HI>Dies Lunae,</HI> which they found given by the <HI>Romans</HI> at their entrance here. For either the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI> were wor∣shipped
<PB N="2" REF="42"/>
by the ancient <HI>Saxons,</HI> and then might think themselves neglected in ha∣ving no place assigned them amongst the rest; or else the <HI>Saxon Pagan Gods were not the Godfathers to all the dayes of the week,</HI> as our Author telleth us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is harsh, that I must be indicted to justifie every metaphorical expression; but know, That the word [bescattered] properly importeth some empty <HI>inter∣valls;</HI> or naked <HI>distances</HI> betwixt the things <HI>scattered</HI>; which otherwise, would be covered all over, and not be <HI>scattered.</HI> If therefore <HI>two dayes</HI> in the <HI>seven</HI> have escaped nomination from <HI>Saxon Idols,</HI> the week notwithstanding may be said, <HI>be∣scattered</HI> by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As much he seems to be mistaken in their god called <HI>Woden</HI>; of whom thus he telleth us. Fol. 54. Woden, <HI>that is wood, fierce, or furious, gi∣ving the denomination to</HI> Wednesday,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Brit. fol.</HI> 135</NOTE> <HI>or</HI> Wodens-day, <HI>armed</HI> cap a pe <HI>with military Coronet on his head, he was the god of Battail, by whose aid and fur∣therance, they hoped to obtain Victory; correspondent to</HI> Mars.] But <HI>Camden</HI> sings another song, telling us that <HI>Wooden</HI> was not worshipped for <HI>Mars,</HI> but <HI>Mercury.</HI> Above all other gods, saith he; they worshipped <HI>Mercury,</HI> whom they called <HI>Woo∣den,</HI> whose favour they procured by sacrificing unto him men alive, and to him they consecrated the fourth day of the week, whereupon we call it at this day <HI>Wed∣nesday.</HI> Thus also in another place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. in Wiltsh. fol.</HI> 241.</NOTE> <HI>Wansdike, in the</HI> Saxon <HI>tongue called</HI> Wodene∣poic, <HI>that is to say, the</HI> Ditch <HI>of</HI> Wooden <HI>or</HI> Mercury, <HI>and as it should seem of</HI> Wo∣den, <HI>that false imagined god and father of the English Saxons.</HI> And herein I shall rather subscribe to <HI>Camdens,</HI> than our Authors judgement. For certainly had the Saxons worshipped <HI>Wooden</HI> as the god of Battail, or <HI>correspondent to Mars,</HI> they would have given him the third day of the week, or the day of <HI>Mars,</HI> and not the fourth day of the week or the day of <HI>Mercury</HI>; as they gave <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Munday</HI> unto <HI>Sol</HI> and <HI>Luna,</HI> and <HI>Thursday</HI> unto <HI>Thur,</HI> whom they worshipped in the place of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> ascribing unto him (as the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> did to <HI>Iupiter</HI>) the power of bearing rule in the Air, governing Thunder, Lightnings, Windes, Showers, fair weather, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>Adam Bremensis,</HI> a good Writer, doth inform us of them. And though it may be true, which our Author telleth us, that <HI>by his aid and fur∣therance they hoped to obtain Victory,</HI> yet this entitleth him not to the place of <HI>Mars</HI>; as many victories being gotten by wit and stratagem (the known arts of <HI>Mercury</HI>) as by strength and valour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>In describing the <HI>Saxon Idolatries</HI> I followed <HI>Verstegan,</HI> as the best in this kind, as who (<HI>Data opera</HI>) had written on <HI>that subject,</HI> and who lately by the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In the last page.</NOTE> Animad∣vertor was styled (and that very deservedly) <HI>a man inferiour to none in the Antiqui∣ties of this Nation.</HI></P>
<P>However, finding a difference betwixt him and Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> in this particular, I fairly entred this plain note in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag. ut prius.</HI></NOTE> <HI>margin of my book,</HI>
<Q>So <HI>Verstegan</HI> pag. <HI>72.</HI> but <HI>Camden</HI> Brit. pag. <HI>135.</HI> makes him to be <HI>Mercury.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now either the Animadvertor <HI>did not, or did</HI> take notice of this marginal note. If he did not, being there tendered so conspicuously to the Reader, it is high time for him to leave off writing of books, and turn his <HI>penne</HI> into <HI>prayers</HI>; otherwise, such <HI>omissions</HI> by those who read unto him, will every day more and more inevi∣tably <HI>betray him to,</HI> and <HI>involve him in</HI> more inconveniences.</P>
<P>If <HI>he did</HI> take notice of this note (which is most probable, alwaies consulting my margin, when making for his <HI>advantage</HI>) he discovered much <HI>superfluity</HI>; (not to say <HI>of</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iames</HI> 1.21.</NOTE> <HI>naughtinesse,</HI>) <HI>Actum agere,</HI> that what I had done before, he must
<PB N="3" REF="42"/>
doe again; and also finde fault with me, who had done it before, in this his un∣necessary Animadversion.</P>
<P>I will onely add, that the <HI>fierce</HI> and <HI>furious</HI> aspect of <HI>Woden,</HI> the evidence of his <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>wood</HI> nature (whence He had his Name) better countenanceth his corre∣spondency with <HI>Mars,</HI> than <HI>Mercury</HI>; the latter being concerned to carry a more meek and mild countenance, as who being of a <HI>tamer kind,</HI> and acting all by craft and <HI>cunning,</HI> did not <HI>fright,</HI> but <HI>flatter</HI> deluded people into his plausible Designes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But from our Authors failers, in recounting the superstitions of our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors, let us next see how he behaves himself in laying down the story of their conversion. In which, though he ascribe some∣thing unto <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk, yet he will by no means allow him to be their Apostle: For, fol. 54. <HI>The</HI> Papists (saith he) <HI>commonly call</HI> Augustine <HI>the English Apostle, how</HI> properly <HI>we shall see hereafter.</HI> And after, fol. 68. <HI>The Papists brag that he was the Apostle of the English.</HI>] In these few words there are two things to be considered, whether he is called <HI>the Apostle of the English</HI> by the <HI>Papists</HI> onely; and secondly, whether he were not so, both in fact and title. Not call'd so by the <HI>Papists</HI> onely, I am sure of that; but called so commonly by as good Prote∣stants as our Author himself. Thus <HI>Camden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camd. Brit. fol.</HI> 136.</NOTE> a right English Protestant, <HI>After this</HI> Augustine, <HI>whom commonly they call the</HI> Apostle <HI>of the</HI> English <HI>men, being sent hi∣ther by</HI> Gregory <HI>the Great, having abolished these monstrous abominations of</HI> Hea∣thenish <HI>impiety, with most happy successe, planting Christ in their hearts, converted them to the</HI> Christian <HI>faith.</HI> Nor doth he speak this onely in the voice of the common people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Id. in Worcest. fol.</HI> 578.</NOTE> but in another place more plainly, as his own opinion. <HI>A place there is about this shire called</HI> Austins Oke, <HI>at which</HI> Augustine <HI>the</HI> Apostle <HI>of the</HI> En∣glish men, <HI>and the</HI> Bishops <HI>of</HI> Britain <HI>met,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Philemon Holland</HI> of <HI>Coventry,</HI> a good Protestant also, making an Index un∣to <HI>Camden,</HI> speaks the self same language; Augustine <HI>the Apostle of the</HI> English; which is short, but full. <HI>Gabriel Richardson</HI> of <HI>Brazen-Nose,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Richardsons State of Europe lib.</HI> 3.</NOTE> an honest Protestant, in his laborious piece called the <HI>State of Europe,</HI> telleth us of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> that the <HI>Archbishops See was founded by King</HI> Ethelbert <HI>in the person of</HI> St. Austin <HI>the Apostle of the</HI> English. More of this kind might be produc'd, were it not given us for a Rule in the holy Scripture, <HI>Ex ore duorum testium vel trium,</HI> that two or three wit∣nesses were sufficient to confirm a truth.</P>
<P>The next thing here to be considered is, whether <HI>Austin</HI> were not the Apostle of the <HI>English,</HI> both in fact and title. In order whereunto, we must first take notice, that the word being meerly <HI>Greek,</HI> doth signifie in its natural and original sence a <HI>Messenger,</HI> a <HI>Legat,</HI> an <HI>Embassador,</HI> from whom, to whomsoever sent; and though appropriated to twelve as by way of excellence, yet not improperly com∣municated unto others in succeeding times, with reference to the Nations whom they had converted. So <HI>Boniface</HI> an <HI>English</HI> man the first Archbishop of <HI>Ments,</HI> is called by Dr. <HI>Holland,</HI> (as by many others) the Apostle of <HI>Germany; Palladius</HI> styled by <HI>Camden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camd in Scot∣land, fol.</HI> 45.</NOTE> <HI>the</HI> Apostle <HI>of the</HI> Scottish <HI>Nation</HI>; and the <HI>Irish</HI> would not think themselves to be fairly dealt with, if their St. <HI>Patrick</HI> should not be honou∣red with that Title also. In this sence <HI>Austin</HI> may be call'd, and that not impro∣perly, the Apostle of the <HI>English</HI> Nation; though a <HI>derivative Apostle,</HI> an <HI>Apostle</HI> (as our Author calls him in the way of scorn, <HI>fol.</HI> 68.) <HI>at the second hand,</HI> though others propagated the Gospel further than he liv'd to doe. It was enough to en∣title him to this <HI>Apostleship,</HI> that be first publiquely preacht the Gospel, and brought the glad Tiding of Salvation amongst the <HI>English,</HI> though he neither con∣verted all the Nation, nor travelled into all parts of the Land to attempt the same. Neither <HI>St. Paul</HI> could be entitled the Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles, St. Thomas</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> nor <HI>St. Matthew</HI> of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI>; if it were necessarily required to their Apostleships, that all the Nations of the <HI>Indians</HI> must be converted by the one, or the vast Countries of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> must be converted by the other; of fi∣nally, if <HI>St. Paul,</HI> to save them a labour, must have reduced all the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to the
<PB N="4" REF="43" MS="y"/>
faith of <HI>Christ.</HI> And this the Embassadors for the King of <HI>England</HI> at the coun∣cil of <HI>Basil,</HI> understood right well, when they contended for precedency with those of <HI>Castile.</HI> For when the <HI>Castilians</HI> had objected, that although <HI>Ioseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> had preacht in <HI>England,</HI> it was but in a corner thereof, the grand bo∣dy of <HI>Britain</HI> remaining <HI>Pagan</HI> many hundred years after: the <HI>English</HI> Embas∣sadors wisely answered, that the Allegation was impertinent to the present pur∣pose, it being not the Universality, but the first Preaching of the Christian Faith which gained the name of an Apostle; there being no Disciple (as they truly ur∣ged it) that ever converted a Kingdome totally and entirely to Christianity, for which consult our very Author, <HI>Lib.</HI> 4.181.</P>
<P>And yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he pains in preaching of <HI>Austin</HI> were not so limited and restrain'd to one Kingdome only, but that he travail'd into most parts of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Heptar∣chy, preaching the Gospell in all places to which the spirit did conduct him, or his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sinesse lead him. Our Author grants him to have converted the King∣dome of <HI>Kent, fol.</HI> 7. and to have taken care for planting the Gospel in the King∣dom of the <HI>East-Saxons,</HI> and for that end ordaining <HI>Mellitus</HI> the first Bishop of <HI>London fol.</HI> 67. From hence he carries him to a conference with the <HI>British</HI> Bi∣shops in the Country of the <HI>Wiccians</HI> (now <HI>Worcestershire</HI>) then part of the King∣dom of <HI>Mercia, fol.</HI> 60. From thence to <HI>Richmondshire</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> where he is said to have baptiz'd above ten thousand in one day, <HI>fol.</HI> 66. And finally, to <HI>Cern</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> part of the Kingdome of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> where he destroyed the Idol of <HI>Heale</HI> of <HI>Aesculapius.</HI> By which we see, that he visited no fewer than five of the seven Kingdoms in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Heptar∣chie, not onely doing in each of them that particular work which he went about, but preaching in all fit places as he passed along. And this considered as it ought, with reference to the distance of those several places to which our very Author brings him, gives him just title to that honour which our Author would so willingly deprive him of, when telling us how the Papists called him the <HI>English</HI> Apostle, he adds these words, <HI>how properly</HI> (so called) <HI>we shall see hereafter.</HI></P>

<P>The Animadvertor engageth deeper in this <HI>Controversy,</HI> than in my minde it deserveth. To sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the difference truly, whether <HI>Augustine properly is called the Apostle of the English?</HI> we must explain two <HI>Terms, Apostle</HI> and <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Waving the generall notation of Apostle for no more than a <HI>Messenger</HI>; In the new Testament it importeth a person immediately sent by Christ, to preach people into salvation: It <HI>was essentiall to their constitution,</HI> either to have <HI>accompanied Christ in the flesh,</HI> a qualification required by St. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 1.21.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> in such <HI>Elects,</HI> who should supply the <HI>vacancy</HI> of <HI>Iudas,</HI> or at the least that they should see Christ <HI>incarnate,</HI> either humbled or glorified; <HI>the latter favour being peculiarly</HI> afford<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to St. <HI>Paul:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 9.1.</NOTE> <HI>Am I not an Apostle, Am I not free, have I not seen Iesus Christ our Lord?</HI> These I may call <HI>primitive Apostles</HI>; and none will entitle <HI>Augustin</HI> the Monk, to be one of <HI>their order.</HI> A second sort I call derivative Apostles, a Term, which though the Animadvertor sayeth is used by me in the way of scorn, I protest it in sober seriousnesse, God hath not endowed me to make a more proper Expression, signifying such as mediatly, and (as I say) at the <HI>se∣cond hand,</HI> and sent by some eminent servants of God to convert Pagans to Christianity.</P>
<P><HI>English</HI> may be taken in a threefold sence.
<LIST>
<ITEM>First, for all the <HI>Nation,</HI> (an <HI>Indefinite, tantamounting</HI> to an <HI>universal</HI>) and this is the most proper sence of the word.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> for the greater part of the Nation, which in common discourse deno∣minates the whole.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, for some part of the nation, which may be made good by a Synec∣doche, especially justified, when it is a <HI>chief</HI> and first (though <HI>least</HI>) <HI>part</HI> thereof, which (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or) <HI>per eminentiam,</HI> taketh the name of the whole.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>My clear sence is, <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk may be called a <HI>derivative Apostle</HI> of
<PB N="5" REF="43"/>
the English in the last acception of the word, and so Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> Mr. <HI>Richard∣son,</HI> Mr. <HI>Holland,</HI> and I doubt not but many more have and may intitle him.</P>
<P>The Animadvertor measureth the progresse of <HI>Augustine</HI> with too <HI>extensive dimensions,</HI> making him a greater <HI>English Travailer</HI> than ever he was; <HI>Kent</HI> was generally the Sphere he moved in, and from thence he was <HI>Itinerant</HI> to <HI>Cerne in Dorsetshire, the boundary of his Western travail</HI>: No personall atchievments by him North of <HI>Thames,</HI> seeing that grave baptization (if in <HI>Yorkshire</HI>) was surely done by <HI>Paulinus.</HI> As for the interview and conference betwixt him and the <HI>British Bishops</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire</HI> (though some probably might be converted in his passage thither, and return thence) no great <HI>advantage,</HI> but <HI>detriment</HI> to <HI>Chri∣stianity</HI> was thereby occasioned, those parts generally remaining in Paganism.</P>
<P>And here I will tender the Reader another <HI>distinction of Apostles,</HI> submitting it to his judgement, They were either of <HI>God alone, Man alone, God and Man together.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>God alone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gal.</HI> 1.5.</NOTE> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> (and the other twelve) <HI>an Apostle not of Man, neither by man, but by Iesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>of Man alone,</HI> being such as the false Apostles amongst the <HI>Corin∣thians,</HI> and else where, whose Commission was made and drawn up by them∣selves, sealed and attested by some of their Factious admirers.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>of God and Man,</HI> and such an Apostle was <HI>Augustine</HI> sent, as I may say, <HI>by God and Gregory</HI> to the English Nation. But let him not ingrosse the name to himself, but admit also as his partners therein, 1 <HI>Mellitus,</HI> 2 <HI>Paulinus,</HI> and <HI>Aidan,</HI> 3 <HI>Felix,</HI> 4 <HI>Birinus,</HI> 5 <HI>Chad,</HI> 6 <HI>Wilfrid, Apostles</HI> also, because sent to, and <HI>convertors</HI> of the, 1 <HI>East-Saxons,</HI> 2 <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> 3 <HI>East-Angles,</HI> 4 <HI>West,</HI> 5 <HI>Mercians,</HI> 6 <HI>South-Saxons.</HI></P>

<P>I have spent more time than I intended in defence of this Title, and there∣fore think it seasonable to proceed from the Person to his Acts. Of which the first we meet with is, the fixing of the Archiepiscopal See at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for which our Author, amongst many other Reasons, gives us this for one, <HI>viz. That</HI> London, <HI>by reason of the receipt thereof was likely to prove the residing place for the English Monarch, and it was probable that the Archiepiscopal dignity would there be eclipst, and outshined by the Regal Diadem.</HI>] But here I must needs ask our Au∣thor, whether he thinks, that this was really one of those many motives which occasioned <HI>Austin</HI> to resolve of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for his Seat of Residence? If yea, then must our Author grant him to be endued with the Spirit of Prophesie, which I think he will not; if not, then a contingency so remote could not be taken by him into consideration, as indeed it was not. For first, <HI>London</HI> at that time, was the chief City of the Kingdome of <HI>East-sex,</HI> one of the weakest of the seven, and so not likely to prevail over all the rest. Secondly, if any of the greater Kingdomes of <HI>Mercia, West-sex,</HI> or <HI>Northumberland,</HI> should in fine prevail, it was not probable that the Conquerors would remove the Seat Royal from their own Dominions into any of the conquered Countries. And thirdly, though the Kings of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> who prevailed at last, and became Monarchs of the whole, settled the Royal Seat in <HI>London,</HI> yet was it not till <HI>Winchester,</HI> their own Regal City, was destroyed by fire, and made unable to receive them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Other Reasons are alledged by me, why <HI>Austin</HI> chose <HI>Canterbury</HI> rather than <HI>London</HI> for his <HI>Archiepiscopal See.</HI> These Arguments <HI>Iuncta juvant,</HI> and will hold in the <HI>Sheaff,</HI> though a <HI>single Arrow</HI> should be broken, I mean, though this one Reason (alledged by me) were disproved.</P>
<P><HI>Austin</HI> needed no <HI>propheticall Inspiration,</HI> whilst <HI>prudential prevision</HI> could suffi∣ciently suggest unto him, that if ever the <HI>Saxon-Heptarchy</HI> terminated (which was most probable) in a <HI>Monarchy, London</HI> might be presumed the principal place of the Royal Residence, as most convenient for Trading, and commo∣dious for scituation: I say <HI>London,</HI> an <HI>Infant</HI> in the time of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> a <HI>Stripling</HI> in
<PB N="6" REF="44"/>
the time of <HI>Austin,</HI> a <HI>Man</HI> before the <HI>Conquest,</HI> and grown a <HI>Giant</HI> in our daies.</P>

<P>Here is more than an <HI>Insinuation,</HI> as if I in designing the <HI>Place</HI> of this <HI>Meeting,</HI> had written something contrary to <HI>Truth,</HI> and also to <HI>my Self,</HI> who indeed have exactly followed the <HI>best Authors</HI> in the <HI>Position</HI> thereof.
<Q><P><HI>Bede</HI> fixeth it [Book <HI>2.</HI> Chap. <HI>2.</HI>] in confinio <HI>Wicciorum</HI> &amp; <HI>Occidentalium-Saxonum</HI> in the confines of <HI>Worcestershire</HI> Men and <HI>West-Saxons</HI>; and <HI>H. Hun∣tington</HI> hath the same words, <HI>lib. 3. pag. 323.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> makes the <HI>Oake</HI> under which they met, in the bor∣ders of <HI>Worcester</HI> and <HI>Here∣fordshire;</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Spel∣man</HI> doth concur with him there∣in.</P></Q></P>
<P>If therefore the <HI>Interposition</HI> of <HI>Glocestershire</HI> distanceth <HI>Worcestershire</HI> from <HI>confining</HI> on the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> ought to have vented his displea∣sure not on <HI>Me,</HI> but on <HI>Bede,</HI> and <HI>Huntington,</HI> whose words I exactly transla∣ted.</P>
<P>May the Reader be pleased to take notice, that <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> a <HI>limitary Coun∣ty,</HI> did in that Age belong to three Dominions: That West of <HI>Severn</HI> (now the <HI>Forest of Dean</HI>) to the <HI>Britans</HI> or <HI>Welsh</HI>; the East part thereof, (chiefly consisting of <HI>Cotswold</HI>) to the Kingdome of <HI>Mercia</HI>; and the middle of that County, (along the East of <HI>Severn</HI>) to the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> as I have seen in an <HI>exquisite Map</HI> of the <HI>Heptarchy</HI>; and this I tender as the most probable <HI>Expedient</HI> to reconcile <HI>learned Authors</HI> amongst themselves, and all to the <HI>Truth,</HI> in bringing <HI>Worcestershire</HI> and <HI>West Saxons</HI> together. Thus being critical in <HI>stating the Place,</HI> and <HI>laying the Scene,</HI> I hope I shall be the better believed in relating the <HI>Acts</HI> of this <HI>Con∣ference.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 61. <HI>That we can part with it without any losse to our selves,</HI> and therefore bids it to make <HI>shift for its own Authenticalnesse,</HI> fol. 60. The Record sleighted thus, is a Memorial of the Answer of the <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>Bancor,</HI> to Archbishop <HI>Austins</HI> proposition, communicated by <HI>Peter Moston</HI> a <HI>Welsh</HI> Gen∣tleman, to that learned and industrious Antiquary Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> and by him placed in his collection of the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Councels: Which honour he had never given it, had he not conceived it worthy to deserve that place▪ nor <HI>had the Papists used such violence to wrest it from us,</HI> without the hope of gaining some what to themselves.</P>

<P>Had I sleighted that Record, I would not have took the pains to have <HI>exem∣plyfied</HI> it in <HI>British</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> and procured a <HI>Prime Antiquary</HI> of the <HI>Welsh</HI> to cor∣rect it; I have given the true Valuation thereunto, esteeming it as highly, as <HI>Doctor Hammond</HI> hath done, thus writing thereof in his <HI>Account</HI> of <HI>H.

<P>But to proceed, this conference being ended without success, there followed not long after the great slaughter of the Monks of <HI>Bancor,</HI> for which our Author in a merrier humor than becomes the sadnesse of the matter, or the gravity of an <HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> hath caused <HI>Austin</HI> to be indited, impanelling a Jury, and pro∣ducing his evidence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible of no <HI>mis-becoming mirth</HI> or <HI>levity</HI> therein. The <HI>impanelling</HI> of a <HI>Iury</HI> is one of the most solemn and serious of all the <HI>proceedings</HI> in our <HI>Law</HI>; I pre∣ferred this method as the <HI>clearest</HI> to present all passages to the <HI>fancie,</HI> and <HI>fittest</HI> to fix the same in the <HI>memory</HI> of the Reader.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Amongst which <HI>Matthew Parker,</HI> the learned Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Iewel,</HI> the renowned Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> must be rejected by the Jury as in∣competent witnesses; <HI>partly because of their known opposition to the</HI> Romish <HI>Church; and partly because of their modern writing, almost a thousand years after the matter in fact,</HI> fol. 64. And all this done to add the greater honour to Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> as <HI>Mo∣dern</HI> as either of the two, and as <HI>averse</HI> as either of them from the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> was Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> no friend unto the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> whereas the other two were Bishops and great sticklers for them. This makes our Author magnifie <HI>Fox</HI> for his <HI>moderation,</HI> whose <HI>moderate testimony</HI> (saith he) <HI>much moved the whole Court</HI>; and as much to condemn the others for the <HI>sharpnesse of their expressions</HI> against <HI>Austin,</HI> (whom our Author him∣self reproacheth often for his <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>haughtinesse, fol.</HI> 62.) which made them of lesse credit amongst the Jury. A thread of which fine spinning we shall finde frequently interwoven in the whole web of this History; and towards the latter end thereof, not a few whole pieces made of no better yarn. And let the Reader take this with him for a taste of our Authors good affections to the several parties, that it is bare M. <HI>Parker</HI> and plain Bishop <HI>Iewel,</HI> without welt or guard, but <HI>reve∣rent</HI> Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> by all means; and so let him passe.

<P N="2">2. The testimonies of Archbishop <HI>Parker</HI> and Bishop <HI>Iewell</HI> are (to hold the Ballance indifferently) the lesse valued, Because in some sort they were <HI>parties,</HI> as who (in their Writings) had engaged themselves in this present Controversie, whilest Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> stands Neu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er as to this particular Controversie.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though the Animadvertor be pleased to entitle him <HI>noe friend to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England,</HI> give me leave to add, and he was no fierce foe against them; But Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> was Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> is Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 66. <HI>Who all this while was very industrious, and no lesse successfull in converting the</HI> Saxons <HI>to the</HI> Christian <HI>faith: Insomuch that a certain Author reporteth, how in the River</HI> Swale <HI>neer</HI> Richmond <HI>in</HI> Yorkshire, <HI>he in one day baptized above ten thousand.</HI>] The <HI>certain Author</HI> whom he means, is an old fragment of a namelesse Author, cited by <HI>Camden, fol.</HI> 136. who tells the sto∣ry otherwise than our Anthor doth: For though the Fragment tell us, that the River was called <HI>Swale,</HI> yet that it was the River <HI>Swale</HI> neer <HI>Richmond</HI> in <HI>York∣shire,</HI> is the addition of our Author. That there is a River of that name neer <HI>Rich∣mond</HI> is affirmed by <HI>Camden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camden in Richmondshire, fol.</HI> 720.</NOTE> who withall telleth us,
<Q>That it was reputed very sacred amongst the ancient <HI>English,</HI> for that in it, when the <HI>English-Saxons</HI> first embraced Christianity, there were in one day baptized with festival joy by <HI>Paulinus</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> above ten thousand Men besides Women and little Children.</Q>
Of <HI>Austins</HI> baptizing in this River, not one word saith he. Neither doth <HI>Beda</HI> touch upon it, as certainly he would have done, had there been ground for it. And therefore if I may have leave to venture my opinion, I shall concur with the <HI>old fragment</HI> as to the name of the River, and yet not carry <HI>Austin</HI> out of <HI>Kent,</HI> &amp; much less into <HI>Richmondshire</HI> to perform that office. For when we find in <HI>Camden</HI> that the <HI>Medway</HI> falling into the <HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camden in Kent, fol.</HI> 333.</NOTE> is divided by the Isle of <HI>Sheppey</HI> into two great branches, of which the one is called <HI>East Swale,</HI> the other <HI>West-Swale,</HI> I see no reason why we should look any where else for that River <HI>Swale</HI> mentioned in the <HI>old fragment,</HI> which before we spake of. But herein I must submit my self to more able judgements. The place agreed on, we should next inquire into the numbers, but that our Author seems to grant as much as the <HI>fragment</HI> craveth.</P>

<P>I could heartily wish that all the <HI>Animadvertors Book</HI> had consisted of such mat∣ter, then had it been <HI>greater</HI> though <HI>less,</HI> I mean <HI>bigger</HI> in <HI>benefit,</HI> though smaller in <HI>Bulk,</HI> and more <HI>instructive</HI> to the Reader thereof. I did not before take notice of either <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West-Swale</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and now prosesse my self the <HI>Animadvertors Convert</HI> in this point, agreeing with him, that this <HI>grand-Baptizing</HI> (if done by St. <HI>Austin</HI>) was done in the place by him specified.</P>
<P>But this still doth more and more confirm me in my judgement, that <HI>Austin</HI> advanced never into <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and that the conversion of the <HI>Northumbrians</HI> was the work of <HI>Paulinus</HI> and others.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 66. <HI>If so many were baptized in one day, it appears plainly, that in that age the Administration of that Sacrament was not loaded with those superstitious Ceremonies, as essential thereunto, of</HI> crossing, <HI>spittle, Oyl, Cream, Salt, and such like Trinkets.</HI>] Our Author here reckoneth the signe of the <HI>Crosse</HI> in <HI>Baptism</HI> amongst the vain <HI>trinkets,</HI> and <HI>superstitious Ceremonies</HI> of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and thereby utterly condemneth the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which doth not onely require it in her <HI>Rubricks,</HI> but also pleads for it in her <HI>Canons.</HI> Not as <HI>essen∣tial</HI> to that Sacrament (the Papists not making <HI>Spittle, Oyle, Cream, Salt,</HI> &amp;c. to be <HI>essential</HI> thereunto, as our Author saith) but onely for a signe significative, in <HI>token
<PB N="9" REF="45"/>
that the</HI> party <HI>signed shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of</HI> Christ crucified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form of Baptism.</NOTE> <HI>and manfully to fight under his Banner, against sin, the world, and the Devil, and to con∣tinue</HI> Christs <HI>faithfull soldier and servant unto his lives end.</HI> A Ceremony not so new as to be brought within the compass of Popish <HI>Trinkets,</HI> though by them abu∣sed, For when the point was agitated in the <HI>Conference</HI> at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference pag. 7.</NOTE> and that it was affirmed by some of the Bishops, that the Crosse in Baptism was used in the time of <HI>Constantine</HI>; Dr. <HI>Reynolds,</HI> the most able man of the opposite party, who had before acknowledged it to have been in use in other cases, from the very times of the Apostles, had not one word to say against it. And to say truth, no man of modesty and learning, could have spoke against it, when it was proved so clearly by Dr. <HI>Andrews</HI> then <HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> out of <HI>Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen,</HI> (each of which died long time before <HI>Constantines</HI> birth) to have been used <HI>in immortali Lavacro,</HI> in that blessed Sacrament. That good old saying of <HI>Tertullian, Caro signetur, ut anima muniatur,</HI> may serve once for all. And there∣fore when our Author telleth us in the following words, that <HI>in that age nothing was used with Baptism, but Baptism,</HI> it must be considered as a smack of that <HI>old leaven</HI> which more and more will <HI>sowre the lump</HI> of his whole discourse. We have already had a taste of it in the very first Book, we finde a continuance of it here, and we shall see more of it hereafter; our Author not being coy in shewing his good affections not onely to the persons of the <HI>Non-conformists,</HI> but their incon∣formity; not to the men onely, but their Doctrines and Opinions also. And this is that which we must trust to in the whole course of this History.</P>

<P>Let me add that a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 27.17.</NOTE> <HI>Curse</HI> is pronounced on those <HI>who remove</HI> the <HI>Land-marks,</HI> and it falleth most heavy on them who <HI>remove</HI> the <HI>limits</HI> in <HI>Gods worship,</HI> (as being <HI>Boundaries</HI> of highest Consequence,) turn <HI>MAY</HI> into <HI>MUST, convenient</HI> into <HI>ne∣cessary, Ornamental</HI> into <HI>Essential.</HI></P>
<P>I have as high an <HI>Esteem</HI> for the <HI>Cross</HI> in <HI>Baptisme</HI> as the Animadvertor Him∣self, so long as it observes the due distance of an <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Significant</HI> Ceremo∣ny, and intrudes not it self as <HI>Essential.</HI> A <HI>Chain of Gold</HI> is an eminent Ornament about the <HI>Neck,</HI> but it may be drawn <HI>so close,</HI> as to <HI>choak</HI> and <HI>strangle</HI> the <HI>wearer</HI> thereof.

<P>Having now done with the Acts of <HI>Austin,</HI> we shall not keep our selves to so continued a discourse as before we did, but take our Authors Text by piecemeal, as it comes before us, and making such Animadversions on the same, as may best serve to rectifie the story and maintain the truth, as namely, Fol. 65. <HI>Thus the</HI> Ita∣lian, Spanish, <HI>and</HI> French, <HI>Daughters or Neeces to the</HI> Latine, <HI>are generated from the corruption thereof.</HI>] This is (I grant) the common and received opinion; but yet, me thinks, our Author who loves singularities, should not vouchsafe to travel on the publique Road.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my passage to heaven, I desire to goe in the <HI>narrow path,</HI> and decline <HI>the broad way</HI> which leadeth to destruction:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth</HI> 7.14.</NOTE> But on earth I love to travel the <HI>common and beaten</HI> road, as easiest to finde, and wherein (if wrong, or at a losse,) one may soonest finde company to guide and direct him.</P>
<P>If I should travel over the <HI>Animadvertors several</HI> at <HI>Laceys-Court,</HI> I have cause to suspect he would sue me for <HI>pedibus ambulando</HI>; And it is hard, if also he will not let me goe (without carping at me) in the <HI>high-way</HI> or <HI>publique road.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="46"/>I build nothing on the <HI>high-way</HI> (so to trespasse upon the <HI>Lord of the Soil</HI>) <HI>but</HI> onely peaceably passe along it: I mean, I make no <HI>inferences</HI> or <HI>deductions</HI> from this received opinion, I derive no consequence thence. All that I doe, is to gain just advantage thereby to honour the <HI>Welsh tongue,</HI> by shewing that it is no <HI>Daugh∣ter</HI> or <HI>Neece (like the Italians, Spanish, and French)</HI> but a <HI>Mother</HI> and <HI>original</HI> Lan∣guage, and might justly have expected thanks rather than censure, from the Ani∣madvertor for my pains, seeing he delighteth to derive himself from British extraction.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For in my minde it is affirmed with better reason by our learned <HI>Brerewood, That those tongues have not sprung from the corruption of the</HI> Latine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>wood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. cap V.</HI></NOTE> <HI>by the inundation and mixture of barbarous people in those Provinces, but from the first imperfect impressi∣on and receiving of it in those forein Countries.</HI> For the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue was never so ge∣nerally received in any of the conquered Provinces out of <HI>Italy,</HI> as to be spoken or∣dinarily by the common people; the Gentry and Nobility might be perfect in it, for the better dispatch of their Affairs with the <HI>Roman</HI> Magistrates, who had the Government and Lieutenancy in their several Countries. And some taste of it might be found with the Vulgar also, who having continual intercourse with the <HI>Roman</HI> Souldiers, and some recourse for Trade to the <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies, could not but get a smattering of the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue. Just so the Gentry and Nobility both in <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> are trained up for the same reasons in the <HI>English</HI> tongue; which notwithstanding could never get the mastery of the natural <HI>Languages,</HI> or gain much ground on those of inferior quality. Secondly, had these National Languages proceeded from the depravation of the <HI>Latine</HI> tongue, by the mixture of the barbarous Nations, it must needs follow, that the <HI>Italian</HI> had not now been the language of all people in <HI>Italy,</HI> nor the <HI>French</HI> of all the Nations which inha∣bit <HI>France: &amp; sic de caeteris.</HI> My reason is, because the <HI>Heruli,</HI> being setled in those parts, which we now call <HI>Piedmont,</HI> the <HI>Longobards</HI> more towards the <HI>East,</HI> the <HI>Goths</HI> about the middle parts, the <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> in the Realm of <HI>Naples,</HI> there must needs be as many distinct Languages in that one Continent, as there were barbarous Nations planted in it, or at the least such different Dialects, as could be scarce intelligible unto one another. Whereas it is certainly and most plainly known, that there is onely one Language spoken in all that Countrey, equally understood by all, without so much as any sensible difference in pronun∣ciation; more than is usual in all places between the Countrey Villages and the neighbouring Citizens. The like may be affirmed of the ancient <HI>Gallia,</HI> planted on the East-side of the <HI>Loyre</HI> by the <HI>Burgundians</HI>; on the West-side of that River, and towards the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the <HI>Pyrenies</HI> and the <HI>Aquitan Ocean</HI> by the <HI>Gothish</HI> Nations, in most other parts of it by the <HI>Franks</HI>; and yet all speaking (with very little difference) the same one Language, which from the most predominant People we now call the <HI>French.</HI> More to this purpose might be said, were not this sufficient.</P>

<P>In this my Expression, that the <HI>Italian, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>French, are</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I request the Reader to con∣sult my words, as rendred by the Animad∣vertor, in the formar para∣graph.</NOTE> <HI>Generated from the Corruption of the Latin,</HI> the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> layeth not so much weight on the <HI>term GENERATED,</HI> as on the word <HI>CORRUPTION</HI>; whereas indeed whatsoe∣ver is <HI>Generated,</HI> must be by the <HI>Corruption</HI> [in some kinde] of that whereof it is <HI>begotten.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Corruption</HI> importeth (as currant in common discourse) <HI>the abasing of a thing from the purity thereof:</HI> Now it is all one in Effect, and equally doth my work, to dignifie the <HI>British</HI> as an <HI>Original,</HI> above those <HI>three Languages,</HI> if they came from the <HI>imperfect Impression</HI> or <HI>Reception</HI> of the <HI>Latin,</HI> which may be reduced to the <HI>Corruption</HI> thereof.

<P>Let me ad a passage from the mouth of a person present thereat: <HI>Bishop Willi∣ams Lord Keeper</HI> could speak the <HI>Spanish</HI> very well; but knowing how much it concerned a <HI>Minister of State</HI> to be <HI>perfect Master</HI> of his Tongue, declined it in all <HI>Negotiations,</HI> Now <HI>Gondomar</HI> in a State-passage, desired Him to speak <HI>Spanish,</HI> and on the Bishops refusal thereof, <HI>My Lord</HI> (said the <HI>Don</HI>) <HI>doe but spoil your good, turning it into scurvy Latin, and it will make as good Spanish as any in the World.</HI> It seems he was of <HI>my Mind</HI> in this present Controversie.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds. Ibid. <HI>The</HI> Hebrew <HI>the common Tongue of the whole world, before it was inclos'd</HI> (that is to say, divided) <HI>into several Languages.</HI>] An Opinion as common as the other, and as weakly grounded, such as I marvel at in our Au∣thor, who having traveld over all the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> should have been better studied in the true nature and original of the <HI>Holy-Tongue.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is strongly grounded on convincing arguments, as God willing shall soon appear.</P>
<P>The Animadvertors marvelling why I am no better studied in the nature and original of the Hebrew Tongue, who <HI>(as he saith) have travelled over the Holy-Land,</HI> moveth me more to admire, that he himself should be so utterly ignorant in the <HI>Brasilian, Mexican, Aethiopian, Persian, Indian,</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Tongues; but especially in the <HI>China</HI> language, one letter whereof he did never understand, al∣though he hath written a general Geographie of the whole world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor is it the opinion onely, that this <HI>Tongue</HI> was spoken universally before the Flood, and even in <HI>Paradise</HI> it self in the state of Innocency, but that it shall be spo∣ken in the Celestial <HI>Paradise,</HI> the language of the Saints in glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not ingage my self in such a point of meer curiosity; yet is it not impro∣bable, that it might be spoken in Paradise, seeing the word Paradise, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greek, is borrowed, as Criticks confesse, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the Hebrew word. Besides, it is not probable that <HI>Adam</HI> lost his <HI>Language</HI> with his <HI>Innocence</HI>; and that he sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke Hebrew after his fall, shall immediatly be proved.</P>
<P>Lesse will I trouble my self what Language the glorified Saints shall speak in Heaven, though I am sure that <HI>Halaluijah, praise ye the Lord,</HI> is pure Hebrew. When people report unto us improbable passages from forain far distant Coun∣tries, we commonly return, <HI>That it is better to beleeve them, than to goe thither to confute them.</HI> But if any have over confidently affirmed, that <HI>the Saints in glorie shall speak Hebrew,</HI> let us rather labour to goe <HI>thither to confute them, than here to believe them.</HI> Mean time let us here take heed of the <HI>malicious language</HI> of <HI>Detra∣ction</HI> against our <HI>Brethren,</HI> and of <HI>scurrilous</HI> and <HI>profane</HI> Language, whereby Piety may be dishonoured.</P>

<P>Insomuch that some <HI>good women</HI> of my old acquaintance, were once very ea∣gerly bent to learn this Language, for fear (as I conceive) they should not <HI>chat</HI> in handsomly when they came to heaven.</P>

<P>The Doctors Book bears the title of <HI>NECESSARY Animadversions</HI>; But if this be one, let it even serve the Reader for his <HI>NECESSARY use.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed I have read of <HI>Cato,</HI> who having heard some Philosophers maintain that
<PB N="12" REF="47"/>
the Heathen gods spake Greek in <HI>Heaven,</HI> being past sixtie years old, he began to learn the Greek, that after death he might the better converse with them; a pro∣ject and practise proportionable enough to Pagan principles: The <HI>analogy</HI> where∣of is too applyable to some <HI>prophane mouthes</HI> of our age, who by execrable <HI>oaths</HI> and <HI>Curses</HI> practise <HI>aforehand</HI> to blaspheme, rendring themselves (without their serious and seasonable repentance) in a neerer capacity to discourse with the <HI>De∣vils</HI> and <HI>Damned</HI> in Hell. But of <HI>chatting of Hebrew in Heaven,</HI> this is the <HI>first,</HI> and I hope it shall be the <HI>last</HI> time I shall meet with the expression.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now for the ground thereof, it is no other than an old <HI>Iewish</HI> Tradition, im∣porting, that this being the common Language of all people before the Flood, was afterwards appropriated unto <HI>Phaleg</HI> (the son of <HI>Heber</HI>) and to his Posterity, because not present with the rest at the bullding of <HI>Babel,</HI> and consequently not within the curse of confounded Languages.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heylins Cos∣mog. pag</HI> 17.</NOTE> But against this it is disputed; first that it is but a <HI>Tradition,</HI> and therefore of no sure foundation to build upon.</P>

<P>Before we come to the serious examination of the point in hand, I would sain be satisfied what means this marginal note, (<HI>Heylins Cosmographie, page</HI> 19.) What? Doth he alledge himself to prove his own opinion; my bad <HI>Heraldry</HI> was never guilty of such a fault, <HI>metal upon metal.</HI></P>
<P>Now that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> was the <HI>common Tongue of the world,</HI> before the <HI>Confusion</HI> at <HI>Babel,</HI> is more than a <HI>meer Tradition,</HI> being <HI>back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> with many Authorities and un∣answerable Arguments.</P>
<P>Of Authorities, we begin with St. <HI>Hierom, one</HI> who is <HI>many Authors</HI> in this Point (because of his great and general skil in Languages) and who in his <HI>Comment</HI> on <HI>Zephany, chapt.</HI> 3.18. affirmeth, <HI>Linguam Hebraicam omnium Linguarum esse Matricem, that the Hebrew is the Mother of all Languages.

<P>It is not to be expected that all the whole <HI>sentence</HI> (spoken by their parents) should be completely contained in their name, but onely that the most <HI>operative, emphatical,</HI> and <HI>expressive</HI> word, should appear therein.</P>

<P>It is one thing here and there to take a name, and to make it <HI>countenance</HI> such a <HI>sense</HI>; and another thing to <HI>charge through and through,</HI> so as all names may be de∣monstrated <HI>Hebrew</HI> in persons born before the confusion of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>

<P>And secondly, that it is such a <HI>Tradition,</HI> as holds no good coherence with the truth of Story, it being a most clear and demonstrative truth, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> tongue was not the Language which <HI>Abraham</HI> brought with him out of <HI>Chaldea</HI> and <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> but that which he found spoken in the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> at his coming thither, to which both he and his posterity did conform themselves. Or had it been the Language of <HI>Heber,</HI> as they say it was, (but most undoubtedly was not) yet, thirdly, had this been a priviledge conferred on <HI>Heber,</HI> that he and his posterity should speak the Original Language without alteration or corruption, it must have been extended to all those of the house of <HI>Iocktan,</HI> which descend from him; as also to the house of <HI>Laban</HI> in <HI>Padan-Aram,</HI> and to the <HI>Moabites,</HI> and the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> as the seed of <HI>Lot</HI>; and finally to the <HI>Madianites, Ishmaelites,</HI> and <HI>Idu∣maeans,</HI> descended of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Esau</HI>; and not be limited and confined onely to the House of <HI>Iacob.</HI> Now that the language which afterwards was and still is called by the name of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> was spoken vulgarly in the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> be∣fore the coming of <HI>Abraham</HI> thither, is not affirmed by <HI>Brerewood</HI> onely, but by <HI>Scaliger, Grotius, Vossius, Bochartus,</HI> (all of them men of great renown for their learned studies) and by many others of this age. By most of which it is affirmed also, that the name of <HI>Hebrews</HI> was given unto them by the people of <HI>Canaan,</HI> not in regard of their descent from <HI>Heber</HI> the father of <HI>Phaleg,</HI> but from <HI>Abrahams</HI> passing over the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> when he came out of <HI>Chaldaea</HI> with his Family to dwell amongst them; that name in the <HI>Canaanitish</HI> language signifying as much as <HI>trajiciens</HI> or <HI>transfluvialis</HI>; and therefore not unfitly given by them to <HI>Abraham</HI> at his first coming thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her.

<P>There be Three <HI>distinct Questions,</HI> which the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> doth purposely huddle together for his own advantage.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether the <HI>Hebrew was the common Tongue of the old World.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether the <HI>Hebrew</HI> was so preserved in the <HI>posterity</HI> of <HI>Heber,</HI> and so con∣fined to his Family, that no other communicated therein.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Whether <HI>Abraham</HI> did bring the <HI>Hebrew Tongue</HI> into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> or rather found it there, as spoken formerly by the <HI>Natives</HI> thereof.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Such as maintain the first, of the <HI>Coevity</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> with the <HI>World</HI> and <HI>Man∣kind,</HI> are not necessarily obliged to defend the two latter.</P>
<P>I <HI>said</HI> and <HI>onely said,</HI> (as neither inforcing it, nor inferring any thing thence) that the <HI>Hebrew was the common Tongue of the world,</HI> and have proved it.

<P>That <HI>Denmark, Norway,</HI> and <HI>Swedeland</HI> are a <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> or <HI>almost an Island,</HI> the Animadvertor will not deny. But that I called them the <HI>Cimbrian Chersonese,</HI> cannot clearly be collected from those my words, <HI>take it in the largest extent</HI>; which amount onely to a <HI>Concession,</HI> to such who have a mind so to <HI>accept</HI> it, and to extend the bounds thereof.</P>
<P>Here plainly to discover my judgement, I conceive that those <HI>Sholes of People, did not,</HI> and yet <HI>did,</HI> come out of the <HI>Cimbrick Chersonese,</HI> in the <HI>strickt</HI> and true ac∣ception thereof.</P>
<P>They <HI>did not,</HI> that is, they came not thence, as having all their birth therein. <HI>Iuitland,</HI> not so big as <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and the <HI>Languet</HI> the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> speaks of, not bigger than <HI>Wales,</HI> being <HI>Hives</HI> too little to hold such <HI>swarmes</HI> and <HI>Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> of People.</P>
<P>Yet I believe they did come out of that <HI>Chesonese immediatly,</HI> it being most probable, that out of the <HI>opposite Continent</HI> of <HI>Norway</HI> and Swedland, they crossed the <HI>Baltick-Sea,</HI> being narrowest thereabouts, and so came into <HI>Iuitland,</HI> and thence <HI>Inunded</HI> the most of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author telleth us, ibid. <HI>That whereas formerly there were manifold</HI> Laws <HI>in the Land, made, some by the</HI> Britains, <HI>others by the</HI> Danes, <HI>others by the</HI> English, <HI>&amp;c. He caused some few of the best to be selected, and the rest as captious and unnecessary, to be rejected; from whence they had the name of the Common Laws.</HI>] That the Com∣mon-Law was so call'd, because compounded of the <HI>Saxon, British,</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Lawes, which were before of force onely in such places where the <HI>Danes, Bri∣tans</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> had the greatest sway; though it be easie to be said, will be hard to be proved. The <HI>Britains</HI> at that time liv'd under their own Princes, and were governed by their own Lawes, and so they were for a long time after; so that King <HI>Edward,</HI> having no dominion over them, could not impose a Law upon them. Nor was it propable that he should borrow any of their Laws, or impose them on his natural Subjects, considering the antipathy and disaffection betwixt the Nati∣ons. There were at that time indeed in <HI>England</HI> three kindes of Laws: The first called <HI>Dane-lage,</HI> or the <HI>Danish</HI> Laws, prevailing for the most part in the King∣dome of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> and that of <HI>Northumberland:</HI> Secondly, <HI>Saxon-lage,</HI> used generally in the Kingdoms of the <HI>West-Saxons, East-Saxons, South-Saxons,</HI> and that of <HI>Kent:</HI> And thirdly, <HI>Mercen-lage,</HI> extending over all the Provinces of the Kingdome of <HI>Mercia.</HI> As for the <HI>Britans</HI> of <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> they had no distinct Law for themselves (as had those of <HI>Wales</HI>) but were governed by the Laws of that Nation unto which they were Subject. By these three sorts of Laws were these Nations governed in their several and respective limits, which being afterwards reduced into one body, and made common equally to all the sub∣jects, did worthily deserve the name of the Common-Law. But secondly I dare not give the honour of this Action to King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor. The great <HI>Iu∣stinian</HI> in this work was another <HI>Edward,</HI> called, for distinctions sake, King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the elder, who began his Reign <HI>Anno</HI> 900. almost 150 years before this <HI>Confessor,</HI> to whom our Author hath ascribed it. But the truth is, that these Laws being suppressed by the <HI>Danish</HI> Kings, who governed either in an arbitrary way, or by Laws of their own Countrey, they were revived and reinforced in the time of this <HI>Edward,</HI> from whence they had the name of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessors Laws, and by that name were sued and fought for in the time succeeding, of which more hereafter. Now as this work may be ascribed to his love to Justice; so from his piety, his successors derive as great a benefit of curing the disease which from thence is called the Kings-Evill, which some impute (as our Author tells us) to se∣cret and hidden causes.</P>

That they did many times harrass and depopulate the South part of it, I shall easily grant; but to the subduing of a Countrey, there is more required than to waste and spoil it; that is to say, to fix their dwelling and abode (for some time at least) in the Countrey conquered; to change the Laws, alter the Language, or new mould the Government; or finally, to translate the Scepter from the old Royal Family to some one of their own. None of which things being done in the Invasions of the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> they cannot properly be said to have <HI>subdued</HI> the South parts of the Island, as our Author (out of love perhaps to the <HI>Scots</HI>) would perswade the Reader.</P>

<Q>THat the Clergy of this your Realm, being your Highnesse Subjects, in their Convocation by them holden within this your Realm, have made, and daily make divers Sanctions or Laws concerning Temporal things, and some of them be repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of your Realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts of Con∣voc.

<Q><P>TO this we say, that forasmuch as we repute and take our Authority of ma∣king Laws to be grounded upon the Scripture of God, and the determina∣tion of holy Church, which must also be a rule and squier to try the justice and righteousnesse of all Laws, as well Spiritual as Temporal; we verily trust, that considering the Laws of this Realm be such as have been made by most Chri∣stian, religious, and devout Princes and People, how both these Laws proceed∣ing from one fountain, the same being sincerely interpretrd, and after the good meaning of the makers, there shall be found no repugnancy, nor contrariety, but that the one shall be found as aiding, maintaining, and supporting the other. And if it shall otherwise appear, as it is our duty (whereunto we shall alwayes most diligently apply our selves) to reform our Ordinances to Gods Commissi∣on, and to conform our Statutes and Laws, and those of our predecessors, to the determination of Scripture and holy Church; so we hope in God, and shall daily pray for the same, that your Highnesse will, if there appear cause why, with the assent of your People, temper your Graces Laws accordingly. Whereby shall ensue a most happy and perfect conjunction and agreement, as God being <HI>Lapis angularis,</HI> to agree and conjoyn the same. And as concerning the requiring of your <HI>Highnesse Royal assent</HI> to the authority of such Laws as have been by our Predecessors, or shall be made by us in such points and Arti∣cles as we have by Gods authority to rule and order by such Provisions and Laws; we knowing your Highness wisdome, and vertue, and learning, nothing doubt but the same perceiveth how the granting hereunto dependeth not upon our will and liberty.

as the same hath heretofore, so from henceforth to shew your Graces minde and opinion unto us, what your high Wisdome shall think convenient, which we shall most gladly hear and follow, if it shall please God to inspire us so to doe, with all submission and humility beseech the same, following the steps of of your most Noble Progenitors, and conformably to your our own Acts doe maintain and defend such Laws, and Ordinances, as we according to our cal∣ling and by Authority of God, shall for his honour make, to the edification of vertue, and maintaining Christs faith, of which your Highnesse is named Defender, and hath been hitherto indeed a special Protector. </P><P>Furthermore whereas your said Lay Subjects say, that sundry of the said Laws extend in certain causes to your excellent Person, your Liberty and Prerogative Royal, and to the interdiction of your Land and Possessions: To this your said Orators say, that having submitted the tryal and examining of the Laws made in the Church by us and our Predecessors, to the just and straight Rule of Gods Laws, which giveth measure of Power, Prerogative, and Authority to all Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Potentates, and all o∣ther; we have conceiv'd such opinion, and have such estimation of your Ma∣jesties goodnesse and vertue, that whatsoever any persons not so well learned as your Grace is, would pretend unto the same, whereby we your most hum∣ble Subjects may be brought in your Graces displeasure and indignation, sur∣mising that we should by usurpation and presumption, extend our Laws to your most noble Person, Prerogative and Realm, yet the same your High∣nesse being so highly learn'd, will of your own most bounteous goodnesse fa∣cilly discharge and deliver us from that envy, when it shall appear that the said Laws are made by us, or out Predecessors, conformable and maintainable by the Scripture of God, and determination of the Church, against which no Laws can stand or take effect.</P></Q>
Somewhat to this purpose had been before endeavoured by the Commons in the last Parliament of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. of which, because they got nothing by it, but only the shewing of their teeth without hur∣ting any body; I shall lay nothing in this place, reserving it to the time of the long Parliament, in the Reign of King <HI>Charles,</HI> when this point was more hotly followed, and more powerfully prosecuted than ever formerly.</P>
<P>What sayes our Author unto this? Findes he here any such matter, as that <HI>the Laity at their pleasure could limit the Canons</HI> of the Church?

As for the case in which our Author grounds this pestilent Position, it was the Canon made in a <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the time of <HI>Anselm, Anno</HI> 1102. prohi∣biting <HI>the sale of men and women like brute beasts</HI> in the open Market.

<P>I conceived it uncivil to interrupt the Animadvertor in his long discourse un∣til he had ended it, and now professe, I know not how it maketh in opposition to what I said, and heartily wish that the Reader may understand it better than I doe.</P>
<P>It cannot be denyed, but that the Clergy did claim and challenge a power, and sometimes <HI>de facto</HI> executed it, over the temporal Estates of the La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty (for I behold the Clergy, more bound, (because binding themselves by their <HI>represen∣tatives</HI>) unto their Canons) yet they never <HI>peaceably injoyed</HI> their Power, as con∣stantly checkt and controled by the Laws of the Land, in such things, wherein the Temporal Estate, Life and Limb of Persons were concerned.</P>
<P>We have an eminent instance hereof, in the Canon, occasioning this dis∣course.
<PB N="28" REF="61"/>
<HI>Anselme</HI> makes a Constitution (and that indeed charitable and Chri∣stian) <HI>against the sale of men and women like brute beasts in the open market place.</HI> Now such persons sold (slaves and Vassals as I understand it) being the Goods and Chattels of their Masters, the proprietaries and owners of their Bodies, they would not part with their right in obedience to the Canon.</P>
<P>Suppose a Convocation some thirty years agoe should have made a Canon, without any confirmation from Parliament, That no Merchant living in <HI>England</HI> should by his Factors sell any <HI>Negroes</HI> or <HI>Blacks</HI> in the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which formerly he had bought in <HI>Guinnie,</HI> it would not oblige to the observation thereof; because in such matters wherein <HI>propertie</HI> was concerned, the <HI>Canon</HI> must say to the <HI>Common-Law, By your leave Sir.</HI></P>
<P>I have writen nothing in this point, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what I have a good Author for. And seeing the Animadvertor in his Geography hath been pleased to tell a passage be∣twixt him and his fathers man, let me relate another, wherein my self was con∣cerned, knowing it to be as true, and hoping it to be as well applyed.</P>
<P>Some three years since, walking on the Lords day into the Park at <HI>Copthall,</HI> the third son (a child in coats) of the Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> desired to goe with me, whereof I was unwilling, fearing he should straggle from me whilest I meditated on my Sermon: And when I told him, that if he went with me, he would lose himself, he returned, <HI>Then you must lose your self first, for I will goe with you.</HI></P>
<P>This rule I alwayes observe, when medling with matters of Law, because I my self am a <HI>child</HI> therein, I will ever goe with a <HI>man</HI> in that faculty, such as is most e∣minent in his profession, <HI>à cujus latere non discedam; so that if he lose me, he shall first lose himself,</HI> as hereafter when we grapple together in this Controversie, will appear.</P>
<P>As for this particular case (for I will engage no further for the present) this Canon did not dispossesse Masters of their property in their <HI>Vassals,</HI> and no meaner than Mr. <HI>Selden,</HI> is my conductor herein, stiled hereafter by, the Animadvertor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his Ani∣madversion on my 8. <HI>Lib. or</HI> reign of Q <HI>Mary.</HI></NOTE>, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>that renowned Humanitian and Philologer.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ne{que} sane Canon▪ hic, aut alia apud nos lata Lex id juris hactenus adeo refixit; quin in Iurisconsultorum nostratium Commentariis passim Legibus quibus utimur consonum agnoscatur. Neither truly this Canon, or any other Law made amongst us, hath hitherto unfastened this right; but that in the Comments (or Reports), of our Common Lawyers, it is acknowledged consonant to those Laws which we use.</HI> And though in processe of Time, first <HI>conscientious,</HI> then <HI>all</HI> Masters laudibly submitted themselves to this <HI>Canon</HI> (forbearing such <HI>sales</HI>;) yet were they not by the <HI>Canon</HI> devested of the power of Doing it, such <HI>vendition</HI> and <HI>emption</HI> being by the <HI>Common-Law</HI> pre∣served unto them, though now, very commendably, long disused.</P>
<P>And whereas the Clergy in their Answer, pretend all their Canons grounded on the Word of God, I would fain be informed where they finde in the New-Testament (which ought to regulate their proceedings) that the power of the Church extendeth to <HI>life, limb,</HI> or <HI>estate.</HI> Sure I am her censures appear spiritual on the soul, by those expressions, <HI>Binde</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 16, 19</NOTE> <HI>on Earth, Cast</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 9.34.</NOTE> <HI>out, Deliver</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.5.</NOTE> <HI>to Satan, &amp;c.</HI> But because the Reader reserveth a lager prosecution of this point for another time, we will also respit our larger answer hereunto.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 88. <HI>The poor</HI> Jews <HI>durst not goe into</HI> France <HI>(whence lately they had been solemnly banished) but generally disposed themselves in</HI> Germany <HI>and</HI> Italy.] The <HI>poor Iews</HI> are more beholding to our Author for his commise∣ration than the <HI>high Royalists,</HI> (as he cals them) in the former passage. But <HI>poor</HI> or <HI>rich,</HI> they might have passed safely into <HI>France,</HI> had they been so minded. For though he tell us, that they had been solemnly banished out of <HI>France</HI> before this time; yet either such banishment was repealed, or temporary only, or (as I rather think) not so much as sentenced. Certain I am, our learned <HI>Brerewood</HI> upon a diligent <HI>enquiry</HI> hath found it otherwise than our Author doth; letting us know,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Brerewoods Enq. cap.</HI> 13.</NOTE> <HI>That the first Countrey in Christendome, whence the</HI> Jews <HI>were expelled with∣out hope of return, was our Countrey of</HI> England, <HI>whence they were banished, Anno</HI> 1290. <HI>by King</HI> Edward <HI>the first; and not long after out of</HI> France, <HI>Anno</HI> 1307. <HI>by</HI> Philippus Pulcher.

<P>The Author will find, that though the <HI>Great, General,</HI> and <HI>Final</HI> banishment of the Jews out of <HI>France,</HI> was <HI>Anno</HI> 1307. under <HI>Philip the Fair,</HI> yet formely there had been Edicts for their Exile thence.</P>

But the truth is, that not onely men in holy Orders, but many of the Laity also had attained that dignity, as will appear to any who will take the pains to consult the Catalogue of the Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal, in the Glossary of Sir <HI>Henry Spelman:</HI> in which appear not onely some of inferior dignity, as Deans, Archdeacons, House-hold Chaplains; but many also not dignified with any Ecclesiastical Title, or Notification, and therefore in all probability to be looked on as meer Lay-men, Counsellors, and Servants to the Kings in whose times they lived, or otherwise studied in the Laws, and of good affections, and consequently capable of the place of such trust and power.</P>

<P>May the Reader take notice, that this complaint was made by the Commons in the 11<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>Anno</HI> 1336. Now <HI>Ever</HI> I here restrain to the oldest man alive, then present in Parliament, who could not distinctly remember the contrary, from the first of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, who began his Reign 1272. so that for full 64. years, an uninterrupted series of Bishops (except possibly one put in <HI>pro tempore,</HI> for a moneth or two) possessed the place of Chancellors.</P>
<P>This complaint of the Commons occasioned that the King some three years after. <HI>viz.</HI> in the fifteenth year of his reign, conferred the Chancellors place on a Layman. But it was not long before things returned to the old channel of Cler∣gy-men, and so generally for many years continued, with some few and short in∣terpositions of Lay-men.</P>

<P>For first there are not <HI>fourteen Canons resident</HI> in the Church of <HI>Windsor,</HI> but thirteen onely with the <HI>Dean</HI>; it being King <HI>Edwards</HI> purpose when he founded that Order, consisting of twenty six <HI>Knights,</HI> himself being one, to institute as ma∣ny greater and lesser <HI>Canons,</HI> and as many old Soldiers (commonly called poor Knights) to be pensioned there: Though in this last, the number was not made up to his first intention.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> was the last <HI>Chancellor</HI> who effectually officiated in his place. <HI>Winsor</HI> before the year 1644. being a chief Garrison of the Parliament.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He tels us thirdly, That there belongs unto it one <HI>Register, being alwayes the</HI> Dean <HI>of Winsor:</HI> which is nothing so. For though the <HI>Deans</HI> of late times have been Re∣gisters also, yet <HI>ab initio non fuit sic,</HI> it was not so from the beginning; The first Dean was also Register, being <HI>Iohn Boxul, Anno</HI> 1557.

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say not that the <HI>Register</HI> alwaies <HI>Was</HI> the <HI>Dean,</HI> but <HI>being</HI> alwaies the <HI>Dean</HI>; which relating to our and our fathers memories, is right enough: but it shall be reformed.</P>

<P>And fourthly he tels us, That the <HI>Garter</HI> is one of the <HI>extraordinary</HI> Habiliments of the Knights of this Order, their <HI>ordinary</HI> being onely the <HI>blew Ribbon</HI> about their necks, <HI>with the Picture of St.</HI> George <HI>appendant, and the Sun in his glory on the left shoulder of their Cloak</HI>; whereas indeed the <HI>Garter</HI> is of common wearing, and of such necessary use, that the <HI>Knights</HI> are not to be seen abroad without it, <HI>upon pain
<PB N="36" REF="65"/>
of paying two Crowns to any Officer of the Order, who shall first claim it, unlesse they be to take a journey</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist. of St. George lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 3.8.</NOTE> in which case <HI>it is sufficient to wear a blew Ribbon under their Boots to denote the Garter.</HI> Lastly, whereas our Author tells us, that the Knights hereof doe weare <HI>on the left shoulder of their Cloaks a Sun in his glory,</HI> and attributes this wearing, as some say, to King <HI>Charles.</HI> I will first put him out of doubt, that this addition was King <HI>Charles</HI> his; then shew him his mistake in the matter it self. And first, in the first year of that King, <HI>Apr.</HI> 26. 1626. it was thus enacted at a pub∣lick <HI>Chapter</HI> of the Order, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That all Knights and Companions of the Order, shall wear upon the left part of their <HI>Cloaks, Coats,</HI> and riding <HI>Cassocks</HI> at all times when they shall not wear their Roabs, and in all places of Assembly, an Escocheon of the Armes of St. <HI>George, id est,</HI> a Crosse within a Garter, not en∣riched with Pearls or Stones: in token of the honour which they hold from the said most noble Order, instituted and ordained for persons of the highest worth and honour.</Q>
Our Author, secondly, may perceive by this Act of the Kings, that St. <HI>Georges</HI> Crosse within the Garter, is the main device injoyned to be worn by all the <HI>Knights</HI> of that noble Order; to which the adding of the <HI>Sun in his glo∣ry</HI> served but for ornament and imbellishing, and might be either used or not used (but onely for conformities sake) as they would themselves.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>OUR Author begins this Book with the Story of <HI>Wickliffe,</HI> and con∣tinueth it in relating the successes of him and his followers, to which he seems so much addicted, as to Christen their Opinions by the name of the Gospel: For, speaking of such incouragements and helps as were given to <HI>Wickliffe</HI> by the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> with other advantages, which the conditions of those times did afford unto him, he addeth, That,</P>
<P>Fol. 129. <HI>We must attribute the main to Divine Providence blessing the</HI> Gospel.] A name too high to be bestowed upon the Fancies of a private man, many of whose Opinions were so far from truth, so contrary to peace and civil Order, so inconsistent with the Government of the Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> as make them utterly unworthy to be look'd on as a part of the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Or if the Doctrines of <HI>Wickliffe</HI> must be call'd the <HI>Gospel,</HI> what shall become of the Religion then establisht in the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and in most other parts of the <HI>Western</HI> World? Were all but <HI>Wickliffes</HI> Followers relaps'd to <HI>Heathenism</HI>; were they turn'd Jews, or had im∣brac'd the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI>? If none of these, and that they still continued in the faith of <HI>Christ,</HI> delivered to them in the <HI>Gospels</HI> of the four <HI>Evangelists</HI> and other Apostolicall Writers, <HI>Wickliffes</HI> new Doctrines could not challenge the name of <HI>Gospel,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought it to be given to him by the Pen of any. But such is the humor of some men, as to call every separation from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the name of <HI>Gospel,</HI> the greater the separation is, the more pure the <HI>Gospel.</HI> No name but that of <HI>Evangelici</HI> would content the <HI>Germans</HI> when they first separated from that <HI>Church,</HI> and reformed their own: And <HI>Harry Nichols,</HI> when he separated from the <HI>German</HI> Churches, and became the Father of <HI>Familists,</HI> bestows the name of <HI>Evangelium Regni</HI> on his Dreams and Dotages. <HI>Gospels</HI> of this kinde we have had, and may have too many, <HI>quot Capita t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Fides,</HI> as many <HI>Gospels,</HI> in a manner, as <HI>Sects</HI> and <HI>Sectaries,</HI> if this world goe on.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>Wickliffes</HI> Doctrines are advanc'd to the name of <HI>Gospel,</HI> so his Follow∣ers whatsoever they were) must be called <HI>Gods servants,</HI> the Bishops being said <HI>fol.</HI> 151. to be busie in persecuting Gods servants; and for what crime soever, they were brought to punishment, it must be thought they suffered onely for the <HI>Gospel</HI> and the <HI>service</HI> of God. A pregnant evidence whereof we have in the story of Sir <HI>Iohn Oldcastle,</HI> accused in the time of King <HI>Harry</HI> the fifth for a design to kill the King and his Brethren, actually in Arms against that King in the head of 20000 men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stow in Hen</HI> 5.</NOTE> attainted for the same in open Parliament, and condemn'd to die, and executed in St. <HI>Giles</HI> his Fields accordingly, as both Sir <HI>Roger Acton</HI> his prin∣cipal Counsellor, and 37 of his Accomplices had been before. For this we have not onely the Authority of our common Chronicles, <HI>Walsingham, Stow,</HI> and many
<PB N="40" REF="67"/>
others; but the Records of the Tower, and Acts of Parliament, as is confessed by our Author, <HI>fol.</HI> 168. Yet coming out of <HI>Wickliffes</HI> Schools, and the chief Scholar questionlesse which was train'd up in them, he must be Registred for a <HI>Martyr</HI> in <HI>Fox</HI> his Calendar. And though our Author dares not quit him, (as he sayes himself) yet such is his tendernesse and respect to <HI>Wickliffes Gospel,</HI> that he <HI>is loath to load his Memory with causlesse Crimes</HI>; fol. 167. taxeth the <HI>Clergie</HI> of that time for their hatred to him, discrediteth the relation of <HI>T. Walsingham,</HI> and all later Authors, who are affirm'd <HI>to follow him, as the Flock their Belweather</HI>; and finally leaves it as a special verdict <HI>to the last day of the Revelation of the righteous Iudgements of God.</HI></P>

<P>First, I fain would know, whether the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> would be contented with the Condition of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as <HI>Wickliffe</HI> found it, for <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>Practise,</HI> and doth not earnestly desire a Reformation thereof.</P>
<P>I am charitably confident, that He doth desire such an <HI>Emendation,</HI> and there∣fore being both of us agreed in this <HI>Point</HI> of the <HI>convenience,</HI> yea <HI>necessity</HI> there∣of; in the second place I would as fain be satisfied from the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> whe∣ther He conceived it possible, that such Reformation could be advanced (with∣out <HI>Miracle</HI>) all on a sodain, so that many grosse Errors would not <HI>continue,</HI> and some new one be superadded.</P>
<P>The man in the Gospel first saw <HI>men walking as trees,</HI> before he saw per∣fectly. Nature hath appointed the <HI>Twilight</HI> as a <HI>Bridge</HI> to passe us out of <HI>Night</HI> into <HI>Day.</HI> Such false and wild opinions (like the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 9.18.</NOTE> <HI>Scales,</HI> which fell down from the Eyes of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when perfectly restored to his sight) have either <HI>vanished</HI> or been <HI>banished,</HI> out of all <HI>Protestant Confession.</HI></P>
<P>Far be it from me to account the rest of <HI>England</HI> relapsed into <HI>Atheism,</HI> or lapsed in <HI>Iudaism, Turcism, &amp;c.</HI> whom I behold as <HI>Erronious Christians</HI> in <HI>Do∣ctrine</HI> and <HI>Practise,</HI> and yet still in such a condition, that though so living and dy∣ing, if <HI>they lead a good life, and being weak, ignorant, and seduced, seriously repented of all their sins of ignorance,</HI> they <HI>might be saved;</HI> closing fully with the moderate Judgement of learned <HI>Hooker</HI> herein.</P>
<P>I know that the very worst of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> have assumed to themselves the very best of <HI>Names, gilding</HI> themselves over with the Title of <HI>Gospellers,</HI> and the like; but because <HI>Thieves</HI> often pretend themselves <HI>honest men,</HI> may not <HI>honest men a∣vow</HI> themselves to be <HI>so,</HI> and also be so termed by others?</P>
<P>The words of the Animadvertor of <HI>Wickliffs Gospel,</HI> might well have been spa∣red, seeing indeed it was <HI>Christs Gospel</HI> (<HI>dawning</HI> is part of <HI>day</HI>) preached by <HI>Wick∣liffe,</HI> in a <HI>purer</HI> manner than in <HI>that Age,</HI> (thanks to God it was <HI>then</HI> so <HI>good</HI>;) <HI>impurer</HI> than in our Age, thanks be to God it <HI>now</HI> is <HI>better.</HI></P>
<P>As for Sir <HI>Iohn Oldcastle</HI> L. <HI>Cobham,</HI> his Case is so perplexed with contrary relations <HI>much</HI> may be said against him, and <HI>little lesse</HI> in his behalf; and I have cause to beleeve indeed, that his Innocence wanted not <HI>clearnesse</HI> but <HI>clearing.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas the Animadvertor takes exception at my referring the <HI>Decision</HI> here∣of to the revelation of the <HI>righteous judgement of God,</HI> it must be Either because

<P>From the <HI>Scholar</HI> passe we to the <HI>Master,</HI> of whom it is reported in a late <HI>Popish</HI> Pamphlet, that he made a recantation of his Errors, and liv'd and dyed confor∣mable to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> This I will behold as a notorious falshood, an
<PB N="41" REF="67"/>
imposture of the <HI>Romish</HI> party, though the argument used by our Author, be not of strength sufficient to inforce me to it. <HI>If,</HI> saith he, Wickliffe <HI>was sufficiently re∣concil'd to the Roman faith, why was not</HI> Rome <HI>sufficiently reconciled to him? Using such cruelty to him many years after his death, fol.</HI> 171. But this, say I, is no reason, of no force at all. <HI>Wickliffe</HI> might possibly be reconcil'd to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and yet the Ministers of that <HI>Church,</HI> to strike a terror into others, might execute that veng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance on him after his decease, which they had neither power nor op∣portunity to doe when he was alive. <HI>Quam vivo iracundiam debuerant, in corpus mortui contulerunt.</HI> And hereof we have a fair example in <HI>Marcus Antonius de Dominis Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Spalato,</HI> who comming into <HI>England</HI> 1616. did manifest∣ly oppose the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in some learned Volumes. But being cunningly wrought on by some Emissaries of the <HI>Romish</HI> party in the year 1622. he went back to <HI>Rome,</HI> was reconcil'd to that Church, and writ there most reproachfully of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; which notwithstanding, he was kept prisoner all the rest of his life, and his body burnt to ashes after his decease. So then it is no such new matter for a dissenting Christian, such as <HI>Wickliff</HI> and <HI>de Do∣minis</HI> were, though branded by the name of Hereticks, to be admitted to a recon∣ciliation with the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and yet that Church to carry a revengefull minde towards them when occasion serves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answer first, I am not <HI>the first</HI> who have discovered strong affections, with a weak Judgement, endeavouring to prove a <HI>Truth</HI> with a <HI>non-cogent,</HI> and <HI>un-con∣cluding Argument,</HI> in case my reason should be disproved.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Spalato</HI> is no proper parallel of <HI>Wickliffe,</HI> in this point. <HI>Spalato</HI> con∣tracted a new <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Out of exact intelligence sent from his neer Kindred, to <HI>Venice,</HI> and thence to Mr. <HI>Calendrine,</HI> now Minister of the Dutch Church.</NOTE> Guilt, by bragging at the Table of a Cardinal in <HI>Rome,</HI> that his Book <HI>de Repub. Eccles.</HI> could be answered by none but himself; and <HI>dum calebat,</HI> whilest the <HI>scent hereof was hot,</HI> they burnt his Body when but lately dead: Whereas their <HI>despight</HI> followed <HI>Wickliffe</HI> at a distance more than fourty years after his Death, on no pretended new misdemeanor.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Animadvertor cometh up unto me, in allowing <HI>Wickliffe</HI> his Recon∣ciliation to <HI>Rome,</HI> a <HI>notorious untruth</HI>; and therefore we may proceed to what is more material, wherein we <HI>two</HI> shall apppear <HI>two,</HI> being, it seems, but <HI>one</HI> in this difference.</P>

<P>And all this while we have expected that our Author would have given us a brief Summary of <HI>Wickliffes</HI> Doctrines, that by seeing the Piety and <HI>Orthodoxie</HI> of his Opinions, we might have thought more reverently both of him and his Followers. But the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ein our expectation must remain unsatisfied, our Author thinking it more agreeable to his Design to hold the Reader in suspense, and con∣ceal this from him: dealing herein as the old <HI>Germans</HI> did with those of other Nations, who came to wait upon <HI>Valeda</HI> a great Queen amongst them; not suffer∣ing any to have a sight of her, to keep them in a greater admiration of her Parts and Person.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist. lib.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Arcebantur aspectu quò plus venerationis inesset,</HI> as it is in <HI>Tacitus.</HI> The <HI>wheat</HI> of <HI>Wickliffe</HI> was so foul, so full of <HI>chaff,</HI> and intermingled with so many and such dangerous <HI>Tares,</HI> that to expose it to the view, were to mar the market. And therefore our Author having formerly honoured his Opinions by the name of <HI>Gospel,</HI> and his followers with the Title of <HI>Gods servants,</HI> as before was noted; had reason not to shew them all at once, in a lump together, that we might think them better and more <HI>Orthodox</HI> than indeed they were. But the best is (to save us the trouble of consulting <HI>Harpsfield,</HI> and others who have written of them) our Author hath given them us at last on another occasion, <HI>Lib.</HI> 5. <HI>fol.</HI> 208. many of which the Reader may peruse in these Animadversions, <HI>Numb.</HI> 113.

For the former, no <HI>Fault</HI> of <HI>Omission</HI> can be found in me, having given in (in a full Sheet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Church.

<P>Sure I am, they were not so bad in all particulars as he there representeth them.

<P>As for the <HI>Doctrines</HI> which <HI>Wickliffe</HI> did maintain, we have some, but want an <HI>exact List of them</HI>; and I believe it is past the power of any Author alive to present it <HI>intire</HI> (defecated from the <HI>calumniations</HI> of his Adversaries;) and therefore <HI>im∣possibilities</HI> are not to be expected from me.</P>
<P>Yet am I not such an Admirer of <HI>Wickliffe,</HI> but that I beleeve he did defend some grosse Errors; and it had been no <HI>wonder</HI> if it <HI>were,</HI> but had been a <HI>miracle</HI> if it <HI>had not been</HI> so, considering the <HI>frailty</HI> of flesh, <HI>darknesse</HI> of the Age he lived in, and <HI>difficulty</HI> of the <HI>Subject</HI> he undertook.

<P>This indeed is one of the most ancient and pregnant <HI>Evidence</HI> of our <HI>Bishops</HI> sitting as <HI>Peers</HI> in Parliament.

<P>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 156. <HI>Yea this very Statute which gave power to a Bi∣shop in his Diocess to condemn an Heretick, plainly proveth that the King by consent of Parliament, directed the proceedings of the Ecclesiastical Court in Cases of Heresie.</HI>] The Bishops and Clergy in their Convocations had anciently the power of de∣claring <HI>Heresie,</HI> the <HI>Bishops</HI> singly in their Consistories to proceed against them, by injoyning penance and recantation, or otherwise to subject them to Excom∣munication. The Statute which our Author speaks of, being 2 <HI>H.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI> 15. pro∣ceedeth further, and ordain'd in favour of the Church, that the Ordinary might not onely convent, but imprison the party suspected of Heresie, and that the party so convented and convicted of Heresie, and continuing obstinate in the same, should upon a certificate thereof made and delivered to the Secular Judge, be publickly burned before the People. In order whereunto, as in a matter which concern'd the life of a Subject, the King with the advice of his Parliament, might lay down some rules for the regulating the proceedings of the Bishops and other Ordinaries.</P>

<P>There be two distinct things which in this Point must be severally con∣sidered,

<ITEM>2. To <HI>condemne to Death</HI> a declared <HI>Heretick.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Power of the former was in this Age fixed in the Bishops (without any competition) and is so clear none can question it.

<P>But certainly it is a sorry piece of Logick to conclude from hence, that gene∣rally in all cases of Heresie, the <HI>King with advice of his Parliament directed the proceedings of the Ecclesiastical Courts.</HI> A piece of Logick shall I call it, or a Fallacy rather, a Fallacy <HI>à d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter,</HI> committed commonly, when from a proposition which is true onely in some respect, with reference to time, place, and other circumstances, the Sophister inferreth something, as if simply true, though in it self it be most absolutely false. As for example, The <HI>Pope even in matters of spiritual cognisance</HI> (for so it followeth in our Author) <HI>had no power over the lifes of the English Subjects</HI>; and therefore had then no power to pro∣ceed against them in point of Heresie.</P>

<P>By which it seems our Author doth relate to the time of the War, when men from all parts did repair to <HI>Oxford,</HI> not as a University, but a place of safety, and the seat Royal of the King; at which time notwithstanding all provisions were so plentifull and at such cheap rates, as no man had reason to complain of the dear∣nesse of them. No better argument of the fertility of the soil and richnesse of the Country in which <HI>Oxford</HI> standeth, than that the Markets were not raised on the accession of such infinite multitudes as resorted to it at that time, and on that occa∣sion. Our Author therefore must be thought to relate unto somewhat else than is here expressed, and possibly may be, that his being at <HI>Oxford</HI> at that time, brought him within the compass of <HI>Delinquency,</HI> and consequently of Sequestration.</P>

<P>Nor is our Author very right in taking <HI>Aquensis</HI> for <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence:</HI> Fol. 178. <HI>Especially</HI> (saith he) <HI>if, as I take it, by</HI> Provensis Aix <HI>be meant, sited in the farther∣most parts of</HI> Provence, <HI>though even now the</HI> English <HI>power in</HI> France <HI>was waning.</HI>] For first, the <HI>English</HI> never had any power in <HI>Provence,</HI> no interest at all therein, nor pretentions to it; as neither had the <HI>French</HI> Kings in the times our Author speaks of. <HI>Provence</HI> in those dayes was independent of that Crown, an absolute Estate, and held immediatly of the Empire, as being a part and member of the Realm of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and in the actual possession of the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Anjou</HI>; on the expiring of which <HI>House,</HI> by the last Will and Testament of Duke <HI>Rene</HI> the second, it was bequeathed to <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh of <HI>France,</HI> by him &amp; his Successors to be enjoyed upon the death of <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Maine,</HI> as it was accordingly.

<P>In agitating of which controversie, as it stands in our Author, I finde mention of one <HI>Iohannes de Voragine, a worthlesse Author, fol.</HI> 181. Mistook both in the name of the man, and his quality also. For first the Author of the Book called
<PB N="48" REF="71"/>
<HI>Legenda aurea</HI> related to in their former passage, was not <HI>Iohannes,</HI> but <HI>Iacobus de Voragine.</HI> In which book, though there are many idle and unwarrantable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictions; yet secondly was the man of more esteem, than to passe under the Character of a <HI>worthlesse Author,</HI> as being learned for the times in which he lived, <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Genoa</HI> a chief City of <HI>Italy, &amp; moribus &amp; dignitate magno precio,</HI> as <HI>Philippus Bergomensis</HI> telleth us of him, <HI>Anno</HI> 1290. at what time he liv'd; most eminent for his translation of the Bible into the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue (as we read <HI>Vossius</HI>) a work of great both difficulty and danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vossig. de Lat.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I here enter my publique thanks to the Animadvertor, <HI>Iacobus de Voragine</HI> (so it seems was his name) was a better Author than I took him for, indeed having read that <HI>Melchior Canus</HI> called the author of some <HI>Legends,</HI> a man <HI>ferrei oris et plumbei cordis, one of an Iron face and leaden heart,</HI> I conceived him incended therein.</P>
<P>But if he did translate the Bible into <HI>Italian,</HI> (as I have cause to believe, knowing nothing to the contrary,) it was, as the Animadvertor saith well, <HI>a work of great both difficulty, and danger, as the times then were.</HI></P>
<P>I confesse I have formerly in the Table of my Esteeme, placed this <HI>Voragine</HI> as the <HI>very lag at the lowest end thereof</HI>; But hereafter I shall say to him, come up hither, and provide a higher place for him in my <HI>Reputation.</HI></P>

<P>A greater mistake than this, as to the person of the man, is that which follows <HI>viz.</HI> Fol. 185. Humphry <HI>Duke of</HI> Gloster <HI>son to King</HI> Henry <HI>the fifth.</HI>] This though I cannot look on as a fault of the Presse, yet I can easily consider it as a slip of the Pen; it being impossible that our Author should be so farre mistaken in Duke <HI>Humphry</HI> of <HI>Gloster,</HI> who was not son but brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth.</P>

<P>But I cannot think so charitably of som other errors of this kind, which I finde in his History of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> fol. 67. Where amongst the <HI>English Dukes</HI> which carried the title of Earl of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> he reckoneth <HI>Edmond</HI> of <HI>Langly</HI> fift son to <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Edward</HI> his son, <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> his brother, father to King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth. But first this <HI>Richard</HI> whom he speaks of, though he were Earl of <HI>Cambridge</HI> by the consent of <HI>Edward</HI> his elder brother, yet was he never Duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>York; Richard</HI> being executed at <HI>South-hampton</HI> for treason against King <HI>Harry</HI> the fifth, before that Kings going into <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> his elder brother slain not long after in the Battail of <HI>Agincourt.</HI> And secondly, this <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> was not the Father, but Grandfather of King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth. For be∣ing married unto <HI>Anne,</HI> sister and heir unto <HI>Edmond Mortimer</HI> Earl of <HI>March,</HI> he had by her a sonne called <HI>Richard,</HI> improvidently restored in blood, and advan∣ced unto the Title of <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> by King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1426.

Thirdly, as <HI>Richard</HI> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl of <HI>Cambridge</HI> was not Duke of <HI>York,</HI> so <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> was not Earl of <HI>Cambridge</HI>; though by our Au∣thor made the last Earle thereof (<HI>Hist.</HI> of <HI>Cam.</HI> 162.) before the restoring of that title on the House of the <HI>Hamiltons.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 183. <HI>This good precedent of the Archbishops bounty</HI> (that is to say, the foundation of <HI>All-souls</HI> Colledge by Archbishop <HI>Chiche∣ley</HI>) <HI>may be presumed a spur to the speed of the Kings liberality; who soon after founded</HI> Eaton Colledge, <HI>&amp;c. to be a Nursery to</HI> Kings Colledge <HI>in</HI> Cambridge, fol. 184.] Of <HI>Eaton Colledge,</HI> and the condition of the same, our Author hath spoken here at large, but we must look for the foundation of <HI>Kings Colledge,</HI> in the History of <HI>Cambridge, fol.</HI> 77. where I finde something which requireth an <HI>Animadver∣sion.</HI> Our Author there chargeth Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> for avowing something which he cannot justifie, that is to say, for saying,
<Q>That when <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wainfleet</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> (afterwards founder of <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge) perswaded King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, to erect some Monument for Learning in <HI>Oxford,</HI> the King returned, <HI>Imo potius Cantabrigiae, ut duas (si fieri possit) in Anglia Academias ha∣beam.</HI> Yea rather (said he) at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> that (if it be possible) I may have two Universities in <HI>England.</HI></Q>
As if <HI>Cambridge</HI> were not reputed one before the founding of <HI>Kings</HI> Colledge therein. But here the premisses onely are the Do∣ctors, the inference or conclusion is our Authors own. The Doctor infers not thereupon, that <HI>Cambridge was not reputed an University till the founding of</HI> Kings Colledge <HI>by King</HI> Henry <HI>the sixth</HI>; and indeed he could not: for he acknow∣ledged before out of <HI>Robert de Renington,</HI> that it was made an <HI>University</HI> in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the second. All that the Doctor sayes, is this, <HI>that as the University of</HI> Cambridge <HI>was of a later foundation</HI> then <HI>Oxford</HI> was, <HI>so it was long before it grew into esteem,</HI> that is to say, to such a measure of esteem at home or abroad (before the building of <HI>Kings Colledge,</HI> and the rest that followed) but that the King might use those words in his discourse with the Bishop of <HI>Winchester.</HI> And for the Narrative, the Doctor (whom I have talked with in this businesse) doth not shame to say, that he borrowed it, from that great Treasury of Acade∣mical Antiquities Mr. <HI>Brian Twine,</HI> whose learned Works stand good against all Opponents; and that he found the passage justified by Sir <HI>Isaack Wake</HI> in his <HI>Rex Platonicus.</HI> Two Persons of too great wit and judgement, to relate a matter of this nature on no better ground than common <HI>Table-talk,</HI> and that too spoke in merriment by Sir <HI>Henry Savil.</HI> Assuredly Sir <HI>Henry Savil</HI> was too great a Zealot for that University, and too much a friend to Mr. <HI>Wake,</HI> who was Fellow of the same Colledge with him, to have his <HI>Table-talk</HI> and discourses of merriment to be put upon Record as grounds and arguments for such men to build on in that weighty Controversie. And therefore when our Author tells us, what he was told by Mr. <HI>Hubbard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hubbard</HI> by Mr. <HI>Barlow,</HI> Mr. <HI>Barlow</HI> by Mr. <HI>Bust,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bust</HI> by Sir <HI>Henry Savil.</HI> It brings into my minde the like Pedegree of as true a Story, even that of Mother <HI>Miso</HI> in Sir <HI>Philip Sidney,</HI> telling the young Ladies an old Tale, which <HI>a good old woman told her, which an old wise man told her, which a great learned Clerk told him, and gave it him in writing; and there she had it in her Prayer-book</HI>; as here our Author hath found this on the end of his <HI>Creed.</HI> Not much unlike to which, is that which I finde in the Poet;
<Q><L>Quae Phaebo Pater omnipotens, mihi Phoebus Apollo</L>

<P>The controversie betwixt us consists about a pretended Speech of King <HI>Henry the sixth,</HI> to <HI>Bishop Wainfleet,</HI> perswading him to found a Colledge at <HI>Oxford.</HI> To whom the King is said to return, <HI>Yea rather at Cambridge, that (if it be possible) I may have two Universities in</HI> England.</P>
<P>A passage <HI>pregnant</HI> with an <HI>Inference,</HI> which <HI>delivereth</HI> it self without any <HI>Mid∣wifry</HI> to help it, <HI>viz.</HI> that till the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Cambridge</HI> was <HI>no,</HI> or but an <HI>obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure University,</HI> both being equally untrue.</P>
<P>The Animadvertor will have the speech grounded on good Authority, whilest I more than suspect to have been the <HI>frolick</HI> of the <HI>fancie</HI> of <HI>S.

<P>Both our Relations ultimately terminate in <HI>Sir Isaack Wake,</HI> by the Animad∣vertor confessed the first <HI>printed Reporter</HI> thereof. I confess <HI>S. I.

<P>But to proceed, Fol. 190. <HI>This was that</HI> Nevil, <HI>who for Extraction, Estate, Al∣liance, Dependents, Wisdome, Valour, Success, and Popularity, was superiour to any</HI> English Subject <HI>since the</HI> Conquest.] Our Author speaks this of that <HI>Richard Ne∣vil</HI> who was first Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> in right of <HI>Anne</HI> his Wife, Sister &amp; Heir of <HI>Henry Beauchamp,</HI> the last of that Family, and after Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> by discent from his Father; a potent and popular man indeed, but yet not in all or in any of those re∣spects to be match'd with <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bullenbrook,</HI> son to <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> whom our Author must needs grant to have lived since the time of the <HI>Conquest.</HI> Which <HI>Henry</HI> after the death of his Father was Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester, Lincoln,</HI> and <HI>Darby, &amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Lord High Steward of England:</HI> Possessed by the donation of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, of the <HI>County Palatine</HI> of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the forfeited Estates of <HI>Simon de Montfort</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester, Robert de Ferrars</HI> Earl of <HI>Darby,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord of <HI>Monmouth</HI>; By the compact made between <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> his Wife, of the Honor of <HI>Pomfret,</HI> the whole Estate of the Earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and a great part of the Estates of the Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI>; of the goodly Territories of <HI>Ogmore</HI> and <HI>Kidwelly</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> in right of his descent from the <HI>Chaworths</HI>; of the Honor and Castle of <HI>Hartford</HI> by the grant of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and of the Honor of <HI>Tickhill</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> by the donation of King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> the second; and finally of a Moity of the vast Estate of <HI>Humphry de Bohun</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford, Essex,</HI> and <HI>Northampton</HI> in right of his Wife. So royal in his Extraction, that he was Grandchilde unto one King, Cousin-german to another, Father and Grand-father to two more. So popular when a private person, and that too in the life of his Father, that he was able to raise and head an Army a∣gainst <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, with which he discomfited the Kings Forces, under the command of the Duke of <HI>Ireland.</HI> So fortunate in his Successes, that he not onely had the better in the Battail mentioned, but came off with Honor and Re∣nown in the War of <HI>Africk,</HI> and finally obtained the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> And this I trow, renders him much Superior to our Authors <HI>Nevil,</HI> whom he exceed∣ed also in this particular, that he dyed in his bed, and left his Estates unto his Son.

But having got the Crown by the murther of his Predecessor, it stai'd but two descents in his Line, being unfortunately lost by King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth: of whom, being taken and imprisoned by those of the <HI>Yorkish</HI> Faction, our Author telleth us.</P>

<P>Now to goe on. Fol. 197. <HI>The</HI> Duke <HI>requested of</HI> King Richard <HI>the Earldome of</HI> Hereford, <HI>and Hereditary Constableship of</HI> England.] Not so, it was not the Earldom, that is to say, the Title of <HI>Earl of Hereford,</HI> which the <HI>Duke reque∣sted</HI>; but so much of the Lands of those Earls, as had been formerly enjoy'd by the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Lancaster.</HI> Concerning which we are to know, that <HI>Humphry de Bo∣hun</HI> the last <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Hereford,</HI> left behinde him two Daughters onely, of which the eldest called <HI>Eleanor</HI> was married to <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Woods<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock, Duke</HI> of <HI>Gloster; Ma∣ry,</HI> the other, married unto <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bullenbrook, Earl of Darby.</HI> Betwixt these two the Estate was parted; the one moity, which drew after it the Title of <HI>Hereford,</HI> falling to <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Darby</HI>; the other, which drew after it the Office o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Con∣stable,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ester.</HI> But the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Glocester</HI> being dead, and his estate coming in fine unto his Daughter, who was not able to contend, <HI>Henry the fifth</HI> forced her unto a sub-division, laying one half of her just partage to the other moity. But the issue of <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bullenbrook</HI> being quite extinct in the Person of <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> Son of <HI>Henry the sixth,</HI> these three parts of the Lands of the Earls of <HI>Hereford</HI> having been formerly incorporated into the Duchy of <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI> remained in possession of the Crown, but were conceiv'd by this Duke to belong to him, as being the direct Heir of <HI>Anne</HI> Daughter of <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and consequently the direct Heir also of the House of <HI>Hereford.</HI> This was the sum of his demand. Nor doe I finde that he made any suit for the Office of Constable, or that he needed so to doe, he being then <HI>Constable</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as his Son <HI>Edward</HI> the last <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Buckingham</HI> of that Family, was after him.</P>

<P>The cause of their variance is given in differently by several Authors.

Secondly, <HI>Honor,</HI> the Earldome of <HI>Hereford.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>Wealth,</HI> that partage of Land mentioned by the Animadvertor. I instanced onely in the first, the <HI>pride</HI> of this Duke, being notoriously known to be more than his <HI>covetousnesse,</HI> not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nying but that the Kings denyal of the Land he requested, had an effectual influence on his discontent.</P>

It was not the <HI>Lord Stanley,</HI> but his <HI>Brother Sir William Stanley,</HI> who came in so seasonably, and thereby turn'd the Scale, and chang'd the for∣tune of the day. For which service he was afterward made <HI>Lord Chamberlain</HI> of the new Kings Houshold, and advanc'd to great Riches and Estates, but finally beheaded by that very King for whom, and to whom he had done the same. But the King look'd upon this action with another eye. And therefore when the me∣rit of his service was interposed to mitigate the Kings displeasure, and preserve the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the King remembred very shrewdly, that as he came soon enough to win the Victory, so he staid long enough to have lost it.</P>

<P>WE are now come to the busie times of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight, in which the power of the <HI>Church</HI> was much diminisht, though not reduced to such ill terms as our Author makes it We have him here laying his <HI>foundations</HI> to overthrow that lit∣tle which is left of the <HI>Churches</HI> Rights.

<P>I deny, and defie any such Designe, to overthrow the <HI>foundations</HI> of the Churches right. <HI>If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous doe?</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my <HI>Back</HI> could <HI>butterresse</HI> them up, it should not be wanting. However, I am not sensible that any such invasion was made on the true property of the Church, but that the King resumed what by God was invested in him, and what by the Pope was unjustly taken from him; though none can justifie every parti∣cular in the <HI>managery</HI> of the Reformation.</P>

<P>But first we will begin with such Animadversions as relate unto this time and story, as they come in our way; leaving such principles and positions as concern the <HI>Church,</HI> to the close of all; where we shall draw them all together, that our discourse and observations thereupon may come before the Reader without in∣terruption.</P>
<P>And the first thing I meete with, is a fault of Omission; Dr. <HI>Newlen</HI> who succeeded Dr. <HI>Iackson</HI> in the Presidentship of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford, Anno</HI> 1640 by a free election, and in a statutable way, being left out of our Au∣thors Catlogue of the Presidents of <HI>C.

<P>Would the Animadvertor had given me the <HI>Christian,</HI> as well as the <HI>Sir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>name</HI> of the Doctor, that I may enter it in my next Edition. But I will endea∣vour some other wayes to recover it.</P>
<P>Such, and greater <HI>Omisions,</HI> often attend the Pens of the most exact Authors.

<P>Our Author proceeds.

But then our Author should have told us (if at least he knew it) that the first hint thereof proceeded from the <HI>Convoca∣tion</HI> in the year 1530▪ in which, complaint being made, <HI>Quod multiplex &amp; varius in Scholis Grammaticalibus modus esset docendi, &amp;c.</HI> That the multiplicitie of Grammers did much hurt to learning; it was thought meet by the <HI>Prelates</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> then assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acta Convoca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ionis</HI> 1530.</NOTE> <HI>Ut una eadem edatur formula auctoritate hujus sacrae Synodi, in qualibet &amp; singula Schola Grammaticali per Cantuariensem Provinciam usitanda &amp; edocenda:</HI> that is to say, that one onely form of teaching Grammar should be enjoyned from thenceforth by the Authority of the Convocation, to be used in all the Grammar Schools of the Province of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> Which being so agreed upon, <HI>Lilly</HI> then <HI>Schoolmaster</HI> of St. <HI>Pauls School,</HI> was thought the fittest man for that undertaking; and he performed his part so well, that within few years after, it was enjoyned by the <HI>Kings</HI> Proclamation to be used in all the Schools through∣out the Kingdom. But here we are to note withall, that our Author anticipates this businesse, placing it in the eleventh year of this <HI>King, Anno</HI> 1519. whereas the <HI>Convocation</HI> took not this into consideration till the eighth of <HI>March, Anno</HI> 1530. and certainly would not have medled in it then, if the King had setled and en∣joyned it so long before.</P>

<P>The Animadvertor discovers much indiscretion, in cavelling at a well-timed truth in my Book, and substituting a falshood in the room thereof.</P>
<P>The endeavor of <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, for uniformity of Grammar throughout all his Dominions, begun (as I have placed it) one thousand five hundred and nine∣teen, <HI>William Lillie</HI> being the prime person imployed for the composure thereof.</P>
<P>Indeed it met not with universal Reception for some years (<HI>babits</HI> not being easily deposed:) and therefore the <HI>Convocation</HI> concurring with the Kings plea∣sure therein, added their assistance in the year 1530. as the Animadvertor ob∣serveth; and soon after by the Kings Proclamation, the matter was generally effected.</P>
<P>But whereas he sayth, That after that time 1530. <HI>William Lillye was thought the fittest man for that undertaking,</HI> Let me tell him, That a man dead <HI>five,</HI> if not <HI>eight</HI> years before, was not fit to make a Grammar.</P>
<P>I appeal to <HI>Bale</HI> and <HI>Pitts,</HI> both which render <HI>William Lillye</HI> to dye in the year 1525. but mistaken herein; For indeed he dyed three years before, if the Epitaph on his Monument, made by his sonne <HI>George Lillye,</HI> may be believed, in a brass plate near the great North dore of <HI>St. Pauls.</HI>

It is well known, that his Father King <HI>Henry the seventh</HI> designed him for the Archbisho∣prick of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and to that end caused him to be trained up in all parts of learning which might enable him for that place. But his eldest brother Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> dying, and himself succeeding in the Crown, though he had laid aside the thoughts of being a Priest, he could not but retain that Learning which he had acquired, and reckon it amongst the fairest Flowers which adorned his Diadem. Too great a Clerk he was to be called <HI>Beauclerk junior,</HI> as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>he were as short in learn∣ing</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first (whom commonly they called <HI>Beauclerk</HI>) <HI>as he was in time</HI>▪ though so our Author would fain have it, <HI>Hist.

Which when he found he could not hold, as being the Archbishops and not the Cardinals, he sent an <HI>Instrument</HI> unto him, to be signed and sealed for the surrendry of his title and estate therein; and not content to have forc'd it from him (the <HI>Cardinal</HI> honestly declaring his inability to make good the grant) he caused the <HI>Dean and Chapter</HI> of <HI>York</HI> to confirm the same unto him under their Common Seal, in due form of Law; which being obtained, and much cost bestowed upon the House, he caused it to be called <HI>Whitehall</HI>; gratifying the <HI>Archbishops</HI> of <HI>York</HI> with another <HI>House,</HI> be∣longing then to the See of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and now called <HI>York-house.</HI></P>

<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> did <HI>gradually</HI> perfect the Reformation, leaving it in a farre better condition than she found it in, in the reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth.

<ITEM>6. <HI>That</HI> all things ought to be common.</ITEM>

<ITEM>8. <HI>That it is no sin or offence to eat</HI> White-meats, Egges, Butter, Cheese, or Flesh <HI>in</HI> Lent, or other Fasting dayes commanded by the Church, and received by consent of Christian people.</ITEM>

<P>I have many things to return in this Contest. <HI>First,</HI> had I <HI>garbled</HI> the <HI>Opinions</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="78"/>
of my own Head, and not presented them to the Reader, as I found them pre∣sented in the <HI>Records of the Convocation,</HI> then the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> had had just ad∣vantage against me.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He taketh exception at me in his <HI>Introduction,</HI> for not giving in <HI>the Degrees by which Heterodoxies in Religion were ejected and cast out:</HI> Yet not he is offended at me, because I goe about to doe it, shewing how bad Religion was be∣fore the Reformation, even in the best Professors thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is more than probable, that these Opinions, presented by such as were <HI>disaffected</HI> to the <HI>Reformation,</HI> were not <HI>over favourably</HI> stated, but rather <HI>worded</HI> to the <HI>disadvantage.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Some of these Opinions, thus condemned by the Animadvertor, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in themselves. I instance in that which in this his <HI>List</HI> is the eleventh in number, <HI>viz That it is sufficient for a man or woman to make confession to God alone.</HI> This at this day is defended by the Protestan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church, which though <HI>commend∣ing Confession</HI> as <HI>expedient</HI> in some cases, especially when the <HI>afflicted Conscience</HI> cannot otherwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e get any ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, yet doth it not <HI>command</HI> it on any as necessary, <HI>necessitate precepti,</HI> so that the <HI>omission</HI> thereof should <HI>amount</HI> to a sin. I am confi∣dent that the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> himself never solemnly <HI>confessed</HI> his sins to any but to <HI>God alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI> And it is injurious in him, to demand of another to doe that which was never done by himself.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> How unjust were it to put all <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ier.</HI> 24.2.</NOTE> <HI>Ieremies bud figs by themselves,</HI> and thence to conclude <HI>all the rest</HI> (which indeed were <HI>very good</HI>) to be like unto them? Such the dealing of the <HI>Animadvertor herein,</HI> who hath <HI>called</HI> out the very <HI>Refuse</HI> and <HI>Dross of the Dross</HI> in these Opinions, and left out the rest, then maintained by Gods People in opposition to the <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Superstition</HI> of that Age, some whereof are here inserted.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They deny Extreme Unction to be any Sacrament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That all those are Antichrists, who deny the Laity the Sacrament <HI>under both kindes.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it is plain Idolatry, to set up any Lights before any Images, or in any place of the <HI>Church in time of Divine</HI> Service, as long as the Sun giveth light.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icular Confession is invented to know the secrets of mens hearts, and to pull money out of their purse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That Sain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are not to be invocated, and that they understand not, nor know nothing of our Petitions, nor can be <HI>Mediators</HI> or <HI>Intercessors</HI> betwixt us and God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That Diriges, Mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> done for the Souls of those which are departed out of this World, are bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vain, and of no profit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That Souls departed goe strait to Heaven, others to Hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. That there is no mean place betwixt Heaven and Hell, where Souls departed may be aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That there is no distinction of Sin, to be Venial and Mortal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. That hallowed Water, Bread, Candles, Ashes, Palmes, are of none effect, and are onely used to seduce people.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The rest I refer to my <HI>Church-History.</HI></P>
<P>Had that all been like these, I would have called them the <HI>Gold,</HI> but (because of many Errors mixed amongst them) I resume my <HI>Metaphor,</HI> and term them <HI>the Golden Oare,</HI> out of which the <HI>Reformed Christian Religion</HI> was extracted. And let the <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Reader</HI> joyn in their thanks to Gods Goodnesse, by whose blessing on the pious endeavors of the Reformers, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>bad Figs,</HI> I mean those <HI>false, indiscreet, scandalous,</HI> and <HI>dangerous</HI> Doctrines are <HI>cashired</HI> and <HI>condemned,</HI> and the <HI>good ones,</HI> understand me, the <HI>Positions</HI> which were <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>orthodox,</HI> retained, defended and practised at this day in the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
our Author by the Parliament to suppresse them also, and not to have given them any place in the present History, especially not to have produc'd those arguments by which some shamelesse persons endeavoured <HI>to maintain both the conveniency and necessity of</HI> such common <HI>Brothel-houses.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Defence of the Apolog.</HI></NOTE> Had <HI>Bishop Iewel</HI> been alive, and seen but half so much from <HI>Dr. Harding</HI> pleading in behalf of the <HI>common women</HI> permitted by the <HI>Pope</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> he would have thought, that to call him an Ad∣vocate for the <HI>Stews</HI> had not been enough.

<P>The <HI>commendable</HI> Act of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in suppressing <HI>the Stews,</HI> may well be reported in <HI>Church-History,</HI> it being recorded in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>King.</HI> 15.12</NOTE> <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> to the eternal praise of King <HI>Asa, that he took away the Sodomites out of the Land.</HI> I hope my collection of arguments in confutation of such <HI>Styes</HI> of <HI>Lust,</HI> will appear to any <HI>rational</HI> Reader of sufficient validity.</P>
<P>Indeed it is reported of <HI>Zeuxes,</HI> that famous Painter, that he so lively pictured a Boy with a Rod in his hand, carrying a Basket of Grapes, that <HI>Birds</HI> (mistaking them for real ones) peckt at them; and whilest others commended his <HI>Art,</HI> he was angry with his <HI>own work-manship,</HI> confessing, that if he had made the <HI>Boy</HI> but as well as the <HI>Grapes,</HI> the <HI>Birds</HI> durst not adventure at them.</P>
<P>I have the same just cause to be offended with my own indeavors, if the Arguments against those <HI>Schools of Wantonnesse</HI> should prove insufficient, though I am confident that if seriously considered, they doe in their own true weight pre∣ponderate those produced in favour of them. However, if my <HI>well-intended</HI> pains be abused by such who onely will feed on the <HI>poisons,</HI> wholy neglecting the <HI>Anti∣dotes,</HI> their <HI>destruction is of themselves,</HI> and I can <HI>wash my hands</HI> of any fault therein.</P>
<P>But me thinks the Animadvertor might well have passed this over in silence, for fear of awaking <HI>sleeping wontonnesse, jogged</HI> by this his <HI>Note</HI>; so that if my <HI>Ar∣guments,</HI> onely presented in my Book, be <HI>singly,</HI> this his <HI>Animadversion</HI> is <HI>doubly</HI> guilty on the same account, occasioning <HI>loose eyes</HI> to reflect on that which other∣wise would not be observed.</P>

<P>These incoherent Animadversions being thus passed over, we now proceed to the Examination of our Authors <HI>Principles,</HI> for weakning the Authority of the Church, and subjecting it in all proceedings to the power of <HI>Parliaments.</HI> Con∣cerning which he had before given us two Rules Preparatory to the great busi∣nesse which we have in hand. First, <HI>that the proceedings of the Canon Law were sub∣ject in whatsoever touched temporals, to secular Laws and National Customes. And the Laitie at pleasure limited Canons in this behalf,</HI> Lib. 3. n. 61. And secondly, <HI>that the King by consent of Parliament directed the proceedings of the Ecclesiastical Court in cases of Heresie. Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>n.</HI> 88. And if the Ecclesiastical power was thus curbed and fettered when it was at the highest, there is no question to be made, but that it was much more obnoxious to the secular Courts when it began to sink in repu∣tation, and decline in strength. How true and justifiable, or rather how unjusti∣fiable and false these two principles are, we have shewn already, and must now look into the rest, which our Author in pursuance of the main Design hath pre∣sented to us. But first we must take notice of another passage concerning the cal∣ling of Convocations or Synodical meetings, formerly called by the two Arch∣bishops in their several Provinces by their own sole and proper power, as our Au∣thor grants, <HI>fol.</HI> 190. to which he adds,</P>
<P>Fol. 190. <HI>But after the Statute of</HI> Premunire <HI>was made (which did much restrain the Papal power, and subject it to the Laws of the Land) when Arcbishops called no more Convocations by their sole and absolute command, but at the pleasure of the King.</HI>] In which I must confesse my self to be much unsatisfied, though I finde the same position in some other Authors. My reasons two, 1. Because there is nothing in the Statu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Praemunire</HI> to restrain the Archbishops from calling these meetings as before; that Act extending onely to such as <HI>purchase or pursue, or cause to be purchased or pursued, in the Court of</HI> Rome, <HI>or elsewhere any such Translations, Processes, Sentences of Excommunication, Bulls, Instruments, or any other things whatsoever which touch the King, against him, his Crown and his Regality, or his Realm; or to such as bring within the Realm or them receive, or make thereof notification, or any other Execution whatsoever within the same Realm, or without, &amp;c.</HI> And secondly, because I finde in the Statute of the <HI>submission of the Clergy,</HI> that it was recognized and acknow∣ledged by the <HI>Clergie</HI> in their <HI>Convocation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stat</HI> 25 <HI>H</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 19.</NOTE> that the <HI>Convocation</HI> of the said <HI>Clergie</HI> is, alwaies hath been, <HI>and ought to be assembled alwaies by the Kings Writ.</HI> And if they had been alwaies call'd by the Kings Writ, then certainly before the Sta∣tute of <HI>Praemunire</HI>; for that the whole Clergy in their <HI>Convocation</HI> should pub∣liquely declare and avow a notorious falshood, especially in a matter of fact, is not a thing to be imagined. I must confesse my self to be at a losse in this intricate Labyrinth, unless perhaps there were some critical difference in those elder times between a <HI>Synod</HI> and a <HI>Convocation</HI>: the first being call'd by the Arch-bishops in their several and respective Provinces, as the necessities of the Church; the other only by the King, as his occasion and affairs did require the same. But whether this were so or not, is not much material, as the case now stands, the <HI>Clergie</HI> not assembling since the 25 of <HI>King Henry the eighth,</HI> but as they are convocated and convened by the Kings Writ only. I only add that the time and year of this sub∣mission is mistook by our Author▪ who placeth it in 1533. whereas indeed the
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
Clergy made this acknowledgement and submission in their Convocation, <HI>Anno</HI> 1532. though it pass'd not into an Act or Statute till the year next following. Well then, suppose the Clergy call'd by the Kings Authority, and all their Acts and Constitutions ratified by the <HI>Royals</HI> assent, are they of force to binde the Sub∣ject to submit and conform unto them? Not, if our Author may be judge; for he tels us plainly,</P>
<P>Fol. 191. That <HI>even such</HI> Convocations <HI>with the</HI> Royal assent, <HI>subject not any (for recusancie to obey their Canons) to a civil penalty in</HI> person <HI>or</HI> property, <HI>until confirmed by</HI> Act <HI>of</HI> Parliament.] I marvel where our Author took up this opinion, which he neither findes in the Registers of Convocation, or Records of Parlia∣ment. Himself hath told us, <HI>fol.</HI> 190. that <HI>such Canons and Constitutions</HI> as were <HI>concluded</HI> on in Synods or Convocations, before the passing of the Statute of <HI>Praemunire, were without any further Ratification, obligatory to all subjected to their jurisdiction.</HI> And he hath told us also of such Convocations as had been called between the passing of the Statute of <HI>Praemunire,</HI> and the <HI>Act</HI> for <HI>Submission,</HI> that <HI>they made Canons which were binding, although none other than</HI> Synodical Authority did <HI>confirm the same.</HI> Upon which premisses I shall not fear to raise this Syllogism, <HI>viz.</HI> That power which the Clergy had in their Convocations before their sub∣mission to the King, to binde the Subject by their Canons and Constitutions <HI>with∣out any further ratification</HI> than own <HI>Synodical Authority,</HI> the same they had when the Kings power signified in his <HI>Royal assent</HI> was added to them; but the Clergy (by our Authors own confession) had power in their Convocations be∣fore their submission to the King, to bind the Subject by their Canons and Consti∣tutions, without any further ratification than their own Synodical Authority; <HI>Ergo</HI> they had the same power to bind the Subjects, when the Kings power signified by the Royal assent was added to them. The <HI>Minor</HI> being granted by our Author, as before is shewed, the <HI>Major</HI> is onely to be proved. And for the proof hereof, I am to put the Reader in minde of a Petition or Remonstrance exhibited to the King by the House of Commons, <HI>Anno</HI> 1532. in which they shewed themselves agrieved, that the Clergy of this Realm should act Authori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atively and Supreme∣ly in the Convocations, and they in Parliament do nothing, but as it was confirmed and ratified by Royal assent. By which it seems that there was nothing then desired by the House of Commons, but that the Convocation should be brought down to the same level with the Houses of Parliament; and that their Acts and Constitutions should not binde the Subject as before, in their <HI>Goods</HI> and <HI>Possessions,</HI> until they were confirmed and ratified by the Regal Power. The Answer unto which Remonstrance being drawn up by Dr. <HI>Gardiner</HI> then newly made Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and allowed of by both Houses of Convocation, was by them pre∣sented to the King. But the <HI>King</HI> not satisfied with this Answer, resolves to bring them to his bent, lest else perhaps they might have acted something to the hin∣drance of his divorce, which was at that time in agitation; and therefore on the tenth of <HI>May</HI> he sends a Paper to them by Dr. <HI>Fox,</HI> (after Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI>) in which it was peremptorily required, <HI>That no Constitution or Ordinance shall be hereafter by the Clergy Enacted, Promulged, or put in Execution, unlesse the Kings Highnesse do approve the same by his high Authority and Royal assent; and his advice and favour be also interponed for the execution of every such Constitution among his Highnesse Subjects.</HI> And though the Clergy on the receipt of this paper remov'd first to the Chappel of St. <HI>Katherines,</HI> and after unto that of St. <HI>Dunstan</HI> to con∣sult about it, yet found they no Saint able to inspire them with a resolution con∣trary to the <HI>Kings</HI> desires; and therefore upon the Wednesday following, being the fifteenth of the same Moneth, they made their absolute submission, binding themselves <HI>in Verbo Sacerdotii,</HI> not to make or execute any Canons or other <HI>Syno∣dical</HI> Constitutions, but as they were from time to time enabled by the Kings Authority. But this submission being made unto the King in his single person, and not as in conjunction with his Houses of <HI>Parliament,</HI> could neither bring the Convocation under the command of <HI>Parliaments,</HI> nor render them obnoxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us to the power thereof, as indeed it did not. But to the contrary hereof it is said by our Author, that</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="80"/>Fol. 194. <HI>He</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the King) <HI>by the advice and consent of his</HI> Clergy <HI>in Convoca∣tion and great Councel in Parliament, resolved to reform the Church under his inspe∣ction from grosse abuses crept into it.</HI>] To this I need no other Answer than our Au∣thor himself, who though in this place he makes the Parliament to be joyned in Commission with Convocation, as if a joynt Agent in that great businesse of Reforming the Church; yet in another place he tels us another tale.
<Q>For <HI>fol.</HI> 188. It will appear, saith he (and I can tell from whom he saith it) upon serious examination, that there was nothing done in the Reformation of Religion, save what was acted by the Clergy in their Convocations, or grounded on some Act of theirs precedent to it, with the Advice, Counsel, and Consent of the Bishops and most eminent Church-men; confirmed upon the Postfact, and not otherwise by the Civil Sanction, according to the usage of the best and happiest times of Christianity.</Q>
So then the Reformation of the Church was acted chiefly by the King with the advice of the Clergy in their Convocation; the confirmation on the post-fact by the King in Parliament: and that (by his leave) not in all the Acts and Particulars of it, but in some few onely, for which consult the Tract entituled, <HI>The Way and Manner of the Reformation of the Church of Eng∣land.</HI> Now as our Author makes the Parliament a joynt Assistant with the King in the Reformation, so he conferreth on Parliaments the Supreme Power of ra∣tifying and confirming all Synodical Acts.</P>
<P>Fol. 199. <HI>The</HI> Parliament (saith he) <HI>did notifie and declare that</HI> Ecclesiastical Power <HI>to be in the</HI> King, <HI>which the Pope had formerly unjustly invaded: Yet so, that they reserved to themselves the confirming power of all</HI> Canons Ecclesiastical; <HI>so that the person or property of</HI> Refusers <HI>should not be subjected to temporal penalty without consent of</HI> Parliament.] But certainly there is no such matter in that Act of Par∣liament, in which the <HI>submission</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> and the Authority of the King grounded thereupon is notified and recorded to succeeding times; nor any such reservation to themselves of a confirming power, as our Author speaks of, in any Act of Parliament (I can knowingly and boldly say it) from that time to this. Had there been any such Priviledge, any such <HI>Reservation</HI> as is here declared, their Power in <HI>confirming Ecclesiastical Canons</HI> had been Lord Paramount to the Kings; who could have acted nothing in it, but as he was enabled by his Houses of Parlia∣ment. Nor is this onely a new and unheard of Paradox an Heterodoxie (as I may call it) in point of Law, but plainly contrary to the practise of the Kings of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> from that time to this; there being no <HI>Synodical Canons</HI> or Constitutions (I dare as boldly say this too) confirmed in Parliament, or any otherwise ratified, than by the superadding of the Royal assent. For proof whereof look we no fur∣ther than the Canons of 603 and 640 confirmed by the two Kings respectively, and without any other Authority concurring with them in these following words (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<Q>We have therefore for Us, our Heirs, and lawfull Successors, of our espe∣cial Grace, certain knowledge, and meer motion, given, and by these presents doe give our Royal assent according to the form of the said Statute or Act of Parliament aforesaid, to all and every of the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, and to all and every thing in them contained. And further∣more, we doe not onely by our said Prerogative Royal, and Supreme Au∣thority, in causes Ecclesiastical, ratifie, confirm, and establish by these our Let∣ters Patents, the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, and all and every thing in them contained, as is aforesaid: But doe likewise propound, publish, and straightly enjoyn and command by our said Authority, and by these our Letters Patents, the same to be diligently observed, executed, and equally kept by all our loving Subjects of this our Kingdome, both within the Province of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> in all points wherein they doe or may concern every or any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them according to this our Will and Pleasure hereby signified and ex∣pressed.</Q>
No other Power required to confirm these Canons, or to impose them on the People but the Kings alone. And yet I trow there are not a few par∣ticulars, in which those Canons doe extend, to the propertie and persons of such Refusers as are concerned in the same; which our Author may soon finde in them
<PB N="67" REF="80"/>
if he list to look. And having so done, let him give us the like Precedent for his Houses of Parliament (either abstractedly in themselves, or in cooperation with the King) in confirming Canons; and we shall gladly quit the cause, wil∣lingly submit to his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I bilieve this should be <HI>bet∣ter,</HI> as may ap∣pear in the <HI>Er∣rata.</HI> But be∣cause the page is mistaken, 121, for 101, I dare not al∣ter it.</NOTE> ter judgement.</P>
<P>But if it be objected, as perhaps it may, That the Subsidies granted by the Clergy in the Convocation, are ratified and confirmed by Act of Parliament, before they can be levied either on the Granters themselves, or the rest of the Clergy.</P>
<P>I answer, that this makes nothing to our Authors purpose, that is to say, that <HI>the person or property of Refusers should not be subjected to temporal penalty, without consent of Parliament.</HI> For first, before the submission of the Clergy to King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the 8. they granted Subsidies and other aids unto the King in their Convoca∣tions, and levied them upon the persons concerned therein, by no other way than the usual Censures of the Church, especially by Suspension and deprivation, if any <HI>Refuser</HI> prove so refractary as to dispute the payment of the sum imposed. And by this way they gave and levied that great sum of an Hundred thousand pounds in the Province of <HI>Canterbury</HI> onely; by which they bought their peace of the said King <HI>Henry,</HI> at such time as he had caused them to be attainted in the <HI>Praemunire.</HI> And secondly, there is a like Precedent for it since the said <HI>Submissi∣on.</HI> For whereas the Clergy in their Convocation in the year 1585. being the 27 year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> had given that Queen a Subsidy of four sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llings in the pound, confirmed by Act of Parliament in the usual way; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y gave her at the same time (finding their former gift too short for her present occasions) a <HI>Be∣nevolence</HI> of two shillings in the pound to be raised upon all the Clergy, by virtue of their own Synodical Act onely, under the penalty of such Ecclesiastical Cen∣sures as before were mentioned. Which precedent was after followed by the Clergy in their Convocation, <HI>An</HI> 1640. the Instrument of the Grant being the same <HI>verbatim</HI> with that before; though so it hapned (such influence have the times on the Actions of men) that they were quarreld and condemned for it by the following Parliament in the time of the King, and not so much as checkt at, or thought to have gone beyond their bounds in the time of the Queen. And for the ratifying of their Bill by Act of Parliament, it came up first at such times (after the Submission before mentioned) as the Kings of <HI>England</HI> being in distrust of their Clergy, did not think fit to impower them by their Letters Patents for the making of any Synodical Acts, Canons or Constitutions whatsoever, by which their Subsidies have been levied in former times, but put them off to be confirmed and made Obligatory by Act of Parliament. Which being afterwards found to be the more expedite way, and not considered as derogatory to the Churches Rights, was followed in succeeding times without doubt or scruple; the Church proceeding in all other Cases by her native power, even in Cases where both the persons and property of the Subject were alike concerned, as by the Canons 1603, 1640, and many of those past in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time (though not so easie to be seen) doth at full appear. Which said, we may have leisure to consider of another passage relating not unto the Power of the Church, but the wealth of the Churchmen. Of which thus our Author.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceived it Civil to suffer the Animadvertor (to use his own phrase) <HI>parler le tout, to speak all out</HI> in this long Discourse; which, although it consisteth of <HI>se∣veral Notes,</HI> yet because all treat of the same subject, and because a <HI>Relative strength</HI> might result thereby to the whole, I have presented it intire: Yet when all is said, I finde very little I have learnt thereby, and lesse (if any thing) which I am to alter.</P>
<P>These my two <HI>preparatory Rules</HI> (as the Animadvertor terms them) I have for∣merly <HI>stated,</HI> and proved, and here intend no repetition.</P>
<P>It is no <HI>Beame,</HI> and but a <HI>Moat-fault</HI> at most, if I have dated the submission of <HI>the Clergy to the King,</HI> not from the first private performance, but the passing there∣of
<PB N="68" REF="81"/>
into Print and publique cognisance. Thus the Age of Children are by their Parents reckoned from their <HI>birth,</HI> but by others from their <HI>entrance in the Register.</HI></P>
<P>But the main fault (and that a foul one, if true) layed to my charge is, for <HI>weak∣ning the Authority of Church, and subjecting it to the power of Parliaments.</HI> But know it is past the might and spight of the most malicious man <HI>finally</HI> to weaken the <HI>just Authority</HI> of the Church, God having solemnly promised <HI>That the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</HI> Yet Princes (as King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth did) might <HI>re∣trence</HI> the Power of the <HI>Church</HI> (or ambitious <HI>Church-men</HI> rather) when they in∣vaded the just priviledges of others.</P>
<P>I shall onely return a few plain and general answers to what is objected. First, before I entred on the <HI>difficult Subject</HI> of <HI>Synods</HI> and <HI>Convocations</HI> (before and since the <HI>Clergies Submission</HI>) <HI>with their respective powers,</HI> I <HI>placed,</HI> as followeth,
<Q><BIBL>Church-History, Book <HI>1.</HI> pag. <HI>191.</HI></BIBL>
<P>This I humbly conceive to be the difference betwixt the three kindes of Convocations, submitting what I have written, to the censure and correction of the learned in the Law, conscious of my own ignorance therein, as indeed such skill neither is to be expe∣cted or required in one of my profession, who am ready with willingnesse, yea with chear∣fulnesse, yea with thankfulnesse to God and man publickly to recall and retract what any such convince me to have mistaken herein; hoping that my stumbling in so dark a sub∣ject, may prevent the failing of others.</P></Q></P>
<P>Having thus humbly <HI>desired</HI> (I say not <HI>deserved</HI>) favour, I hope it will be indul∣ged unto me.</P>
<P>Secondly, I presume to tender this (I hope reasonable) motion to the Reader, that seeing the Animadvertor not onely freely confesseth this Subject to be an <HI>intricate Labyrinth,</HI> but also fairly acknowledgeth, <HI>that he findeth the Positions I maintain</HI> in <HI>SOME OTHER AUTHORS,</HI> that I may be <HI>discharged,</HI> and that the guilt (if any) may be derived on such <HI>Authors</HI> as have misguided me.</P>
<P>Thirdly, When I use the word <HI>Parliament,</HI> it expoundeth it self what was meant thereby (capable in that age of no other comment) <HI>viz. The aggregation of the King, Lords, and Commons.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, I distinguish betwixt a <HI>consultive, conclusive,</HI> and <HI>punitive</HI> power in matters of Religion. The <HI>consultive power</HI> God hath intrusted his <HI>Church</HI> with, and the Clergy as the Representative thereof. The <HI>conclusive power</HI> also is inve∣sted in them, so far forth as to declare what is <HI>Orthodox,</HI> and what <HI>Heretical.</HI> But the <HI>punitive power</HI> (especially when exceeding Church Censors) and extending to Life, Limb, and Estate, is in the <HI>Parliament</HI>; that so neither <HI>Royal Prerogative</HI> nor <HI>Subjects Right</HI> may be injured.</P>
<P>Fifthly, I distinguish betwixt the power which the <HI>Convocation</HI> had over the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and what they have over the Laity. Over the Estates of the latter, they have no power.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Clergy,</HI> they are all represented, by their voluntary elections, in their <HI>Clerks</HI> or <HI>Proctors: Volenti non fit injuria, A man that is willing is not wronged.</HI> What summes therefore they give away of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> they may be presumed impowred therein, with the consent of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> However, to clear all doubts, the consent of Parliament hath [since the <HI>Submission of the Clergy</HI>] been required unto it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>black Swan</HI> in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> I mean that <HI>single</HI> and <HI>signal</HI> instance of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Unparliament-impowred-Convocation,</HI> which gave that <HI>suppli∣mental Subsidie</HI> to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; I humbly conceive that the <HI>popularity</HI> of so peerlesse a Princesse, the <HI>necessity</HI> of her occasions, and the <HI>tranquilitie</HI> of those times (a happinesse denyed in our Age) made that <HI>unquestioned,</HI> which might be <HI>questionable</HI> if any <HI>turbulent Clergy-man</HI> had proved <HI>recusant</HI> in payment.</P>
<P>As to the Convocation 1640. let me request the Reader, that I may without danger humbly tender my opinion therein. That Convocation (as all others) consisted of <HI>Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons,</HI> and <HI>Clerks.</HI> Of these, the three former acted onely in their <HI>personal capacities,</HI> and carrying their own Purses in their own pockets, might give Subsidies to the King to what proportion they pleased, and justifie the doing thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="81"/>Not so the fourth and last Members, being <HI>Clerks</HI> chosen for their respective <HI>Cathedrals</HI> and <HI>Diocesses,</HI> legally to sit as long as the Parliament lasted. After the dissolution whereof they desisted to be <HI>publique Persons,</HI> lost the notion of <HI>Repre∣sentatives,</HI> and returned to their private condition. In which capacity they might have given for themselves what sums they pleased, but could not vote away the e∣states of other <HI>Clergy-men,</HI> except the respective <HI>Cathedrals</HI> and <HI>Diocesses</HI> had <HI>re-Elected</HI> them; which had it been done, they might no doubt have justifyed the gi∣ving away of Subsidies, as authorized thereunto, though the Parliament had been dissolved, seeing <HI>every man may doe with his owne as he pleaseth,</HI> and the <HI>diffusive Clergy</HI> were justly interpreted <HI>to doe</HI> what <HI>was done</HI> by their Proctors. Truth may be blamed, but cannot be shamed, and I have unbosomed my thoughts and judg∣ment herein. But this outswelleth the proportion of my booke, and let me make a faire motion to the Animadvertor. I resume my two former Propositions, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 <HI>The proceedings of the Canon Law in what touched temporals of Life, Limb, and Estate, was alwaies limited with the secular Lawes and Nationall Customes of</HI> England.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 <HI>That the King, by consent of Parliament, directed the proceedings of Ecclesiasti∣call Courts, against declared Hereticks, so that they could not punish them in Life or Limbe, but as limited by the Statute.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If the Animadvertor, who hath leisure and abilitie, be pleased in confutation of these my Propositions, to write a few sheets (it being richly worth his and the Readers paines) cleerly, briefly, fully and fairly, without the <HI>least dash of ill language,</HI> subscribing his name thereunto, I will God willing returne him my an∣swere qualified accordingly; and, though I confesse the Animadvertor hath the advantage of me at the <HI>weapon of Law,</HI> yet my confidence of <HI>a good Cause</HI> will make mee undertake the Challenge; alwaies provided, That no advantage be taken against us by any for delivering our Judgements and Consciences in so nice a Controversie: For the present I forbeare, because this dispute is <HI>substantive</HI> e∣nough to <HI>stand by it self,</HI> and too large to bee <HI>adjected</HI> to this booke.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 253. <HI>I have heard</HI> (saith he) <HI>that</HI> Queen Elizabeth <HI>being informed that</HI> Dr. Pilkington Bishop <HI>of</HI> Durham <HI>had given ten thousand pounds in marriage with his Daughter; and being offended that a Prelates daughter should equall a Princesse in Portion, took away one thousand pounds a year from that Bishoprick, and assigned it for the better maintenance of the Garrison of</HI> Barwick.] In telling of which story our Author commits many mistakes, as in most things else. For first to justifie the Queens displeasure (if she were displeased) he makes the Bishop richer, and the Portion greater than indeed they were. The ten thousand pounds <HI>Lib</HI> 9 <HI>fol.</HI> 109. being shrunk to eight; and that eight thousand pound not given to one Daughter (as is here affirmed) but divided equally between two: whereof the one was married to Sir <HI>Iames Harrington,</HI> the other unto <HI>Dunch</HI> of <HI>Berkshire.</HI> Secondly, this could be no cause of the Queens displeasure, and much lesse of the Countries envie; that Bishop having sat in the See of <HI>Durham</HI> above seventeen years. And certainly he must needs have been a very <HI>ill Husband</HI> if out of such a great Revenue he had not saved five hundred pounds <HI>per annum</HI> to pre∣fer his Children; the income being as great, and the charges of Hospility lesse than they have been since. Thirdly, the Queen did not take away a thousand pound a year from that Bishoprick, as is here affirmed. The Lands were left to it as before, but in regard the Garrison of <HI>Barwick</HI> preserved the Bishops Lands and Tenants from the spoil of the <HI>Scots</HI>; the Queen thought fit, that the Bishops should contribute towards their own defence, imposing on them an annual pen∣sion of a thousand pound for the better maintaining of that Garrison. Fourthly, Bishop <HI>Pilkington</HI> was no <HI>Doctor,</HI> but a Batchelor of Divinity onely; and possibly had not been raised by our Author to an higher title and Degree than the Univer∣sity had given him, but that he was a <HI>Conniver at Non-conformity,</HI> as our Author
<PB N="70" REF="82"/>
telleth us <HI>Lib.</HI> 9. <HI>fol.</HI> 109. Lastly, I shall here add, that I conceived the Pension above mentioned, not to have been laid upon that See after <HI>Pilkingtons</HI> death, but on his first preferment to it, the <HI>French</HI> having then newly landed some forces in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which put the Queen upon a necessity of doubling her Guards and in∣creasing her Garrisons. But whatsoever was the cause of imposing this great yearly payment upon that Bishoprick, certain I am, that it continued, and the money was duly paid into the Exchequer for many years, after the true cause thereof was taken away; the Queens displeasure against <HI>Pilkington</HI> ending either with his life or hers, and all the Garrisons and forces upon the Borders being ta∣ken away in the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Iames.</HI> So true is that old saying, <HI>Quod Christus non capit, fiscus rapit</HI>; never more fully verified than in this par∣ticular.</P>

<P>Secondly, their <HI>Orthodoxnesse</HI> in many points, here reckoned up by the Ani∣madvertor, which in the Judgement of many pious and <HI>learned Divines,</HI> deserve just commendation.

<P>WE are now come unto the Reign of <HI>King Edward the sixth,</HI> which our Author passeth lightly over, though very full of action and great alterations.

<Q>That it shall be lawfull for all people in time of Harvest, to labour upon Holy and Festival dayes, and save that thing which God hath sent, and that scrupulosity to abstain from working on those dayes doth grievously offend God.

<HI>Whe∣ther in the</HI> 24 Inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, <HI>labouring</HI> in time of Harvest <HI>upon</HI> Holy-dayes <HI>and</HI> Festi∣vals, <HI>relateth not onely to those of</HI> Ecclesiastical Constitution (<HI>as dedicated to</HI> Saints) <HI>or be inclusive of the</HI> Lords-day <HI>also.</HI>].

<P>I say not that they were <HI>trifles,</HI> but that <HI>Iohn Dudley</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> (after∣wards) Duke of <HI>Northumberland</HI>) counted them so, in respect to his high designes to the <HI>Crown</HI> yea it is more than suspicious, that his ambition esteemed greater matters than <HI>Ceremonies, meer trifles,</HI> even <HI>Religion</HI> it self, which he so often changed.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Cat hath put in her claw,</HI> let her put in <HI>her whole foot.</HI> I conceive such <HI>vestments comparatively trifles,</HI> as to things necessary to salvation. And thus I prove it.</P>
<P>I dare <HI>wager</HI> with the Animadvertor. That take the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> as con∣stituted 1640, that <HI>three parts</HI> of <HI>four</HI> did not know what a <HI>CHIMERE</HI> was. Nor is this any diminution to their Learning and Religion; seeing they were not bound to take cognisance thereof.

<P>THe short Reigns of <HI>King Edward the sixth,</HI> and <HI>Queen Mary</HI> being briefly past over by our Author, he spends the more time in setting out the affairs of the Church under <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI>; not so much because her Reign was long, but because it was a busie Age, and full of Faction. To which Faction how he stands aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted, he is not coy to let us see on all occasions, giving us in the very first entrance this brief, but notable <HI>Essay, viz.</HI></P>
<P>Fol. 51. Idolaty <HI>is not to be permitted a moment; the first minute is the fittest to abolish it: all that have power, have right to destroy it by that grand</HI> Charter <HI>of Re∣ligion, whereby every one is bound to advance Gods glory. And if Sovereigns for∣get, no reason but Subjects should remember their duty.</HI>] Our Author speaks this in behalf of some forward Spirits, who not enduring the <HI>lazinesse of Authority</HI> in order to the great work of Reformation, <HI>fell before hand to the beating down of super∣stitious</HI> Pictures <HI>and</HI> Images. And though some others condemned their indiscreti∣on herein, yet our Author will not, but rather gives these reasons for their justifica∣tion; 1. That the Popish Religion is Idolatry. 2. That Idolatry is to be destroyed by all that have power to doe it. 3. (Which is indeed the main) that if the <HI>Sove∣reigns</HI> do forget, there is no reason but <HI>Subjects</HI> should remember their duty. This being our Authors Master-piece, and a fair ground-work for Seditious and Re∣bellious for the times ensuing, I shall spend a little the more time in the examina∣tion of the propositions, as before we had them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<PB N="84" REF="89"/>
Our Author follows this Design of putting matters of Religion into the power of <HI>Parliaments,</HI> though he hath chosen a very ill <HI>Medium</HI> to conclude the point. This Parliament as active as he seems to make it, troubled it self so little with matters of Religion, that had it done lesse, it had done just nothing. All that it did, was the Repealing of some Acts made in the time of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and setling matters in the same State in which she found them at her first coming to the Crown. The Common Prayer Book being reviewed and fitted to the use of the Church by some godly men, appointed by the Queen alone, receiv'd no other confirmation in this present Parliament, than what it had before in the last years of King <HI>Edward.</HI> The Supremacy was again restor'd, as it had been formerly; the Title of Supreme head, which seem'd offensive unto many of both Religions, being changed into that of Supreme Governor, nothing in all this done <HI>de novo,</HI> which could intitle this Parliament to such activity in matters of Religion, but that our Author had a minde to undervalue the <HI>Convocation,</HI> as being <HI>little imploy∣ed, and lesse regarded.</HI> I grant indeed, that the <HI>Convocation</HI> of that year did only meet for forms sake, without acting any thing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>In the mean time I would fain know our Authors Reason, why speaking of the <HI>Convocation</HI> and the <HI>Parliament</HI> in the notion of Twins, the <HI>Convocation</HI> must be made the younger Brother. Assuredly there had been Convocations in the Church of <HI>England</HI> some hundreds of years before the name of Parliament had been ever heard of; which he that lists to read the collection of Councels pub∣lished by that learned and industrious Gentleman Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> cannot but perceive.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confesse <HI>Convocations</HI> in their <HI>general notion</HI> more ancient, and <HI>regular,</HI> and completely constituted than <HI>Parliaments:</HI> Yet of these <HI>Twins,</HI> I called the <HI>Con∣vocation</HI> the younger Brother properly enough.</P>
<P>First, Because modern Convocations, as modelled since the submission of the Clergy to <HI>Henry the eighth,</HI> are many years junior to Parliaments.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Convocations alwaies began the day after the Parliament, the Archbishops and Bishops alwaies attending the King the first day in Parliament.</P>
<P>Lastly, The <HI>Parliament</HI> hath made a <HI>younger Brother</HI> of the Convocation: And there being a priority in Power, he in effect is the Heir and elder Brother, who confineth the other to a poor pittance and small portion as our Age can well re∣member.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the <HI>literal</HI> and <HI>Grammatical sense</HI> is worded in so <HI>favourable</HI> and <HI>receptive terms,</HI> that two <HI>opposite parties</HI> (both well<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>skilled in <HI>Grammer</HI>) have with great assurance of successe, pleaded them in their defence.</P>
<P>In such Cases, when the Controversie is admissive of a <HI>latitude,</HI> as not necessa∣ry to salvation, the <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>learned Penners</HI> of the Articles, though they did not purposely use <HI>Cheverel</HI> expressions (to afford <HI>shelter</HI> to <HI>equivocation</HI>;) yet prudent∣ly <HI>seeing</HI> that all things in the <HI>Articles</HI> were not of equall concernment, and po∣litickly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore-seeing</HI> men would be divided and differ in their judgements about them, selected phrases <HI>Grammatically</HI> admissive of <HI>several senses,</HI> all consistent with Salvation; and would draw their words no closer, for fear of <HI>strangling tender Consciences.</HI> Hence is it that in the <HI>Question,</HI> Whether <HI>Concupiscence be properly a sin in the Regenerate?</HI> both parties appeal unto the <HI>Article,</HI> equally perswaded there so finde favour in their several <HI>Opinions</HI>; as indeed (like a <HI>well drawn Picture</HI>) it seemeth to <HI>Eye</HI> them both, and yet <HI>frown</HI> on neither.</P>

<P>They had not otherwise attained to the end they aimed at, which was <HI>ad tollen∣dam opinionum dissensionem, &amp; consensum in vera Religione firmandum</HI>; that is to say, to take away diversitie of Opinions, and to establish an agreement in the true Re∣ligion. Which end could never be effected, if men were left unto the <HI>liberty of dissenting,</HI> or might have leave to put their own sense upon the Articles. But whereas our instances in the <HI>Article</HI> of <HI>Christs descent into Hell,</HI> telling us that <HI>Christs preaching unto the Spirits there</HI> (on which the Article seemed to be ground∣ed in King <HI>Edwards</HI> Book) was left out in this; and thereupon inferreth, that men are left unto a <HI>latitude concerning the cause, time, manner of his discent</HI>; I must needs say, that he is very much mistaken. For first the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> hath
<PB N="86" REF="90"/>
alwaies constantly maintained a <HI>local Descent,</HI> though many which would be thought her Children, the better to comply with <HI>Calvin</HI> and some other Di∣vines of forain Nations, have deviated in this point from the sense of the Church. And secondly, the reason why this Convocation left out that passage of Christ preaching to the spirits in hell; was not, that men might be left unto a <HI>latitude</HI> concerning the <HI>cause, time,</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of his <HI>Descent,</HI> as our Author dreams; but because that passaage of St. <HI>Peter</HI> being capable of some other in∣terpretations, was not conceived to be a clear and sufficient evidence to prove the Article.

<P>I will confess this hitherto hath staggered me, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> his application of <HI>Davids</HI> words to Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 2.27.</NOTE> <HI>thou shalt not leave my soul in hel.</HI></P>
<P>I appeal whether these words import not a favour to all unprejudiced hearers, which God did to his Son, bearing this natural and unviolated sense, <HI>That had God left Christs soul in hell, his soul had been in a bad condition, as being there in a suffering capacity, but Gods Paternal affection to his dear Son, would not leave his soul in hell,</HI> but did rescue it thence.</P>
<P>Now all our Protestant, and especially English Writers, who maintain a <HI>LOCAL DESCENT,</HI> doe very worthily (in opposition to the <HI>Romish Error</HI>) de∣fend, that Christ was then in a good estate, yea in a <HI>triumphing</HI> condition.</P>
<P>Now then, it had been no favour not to leave his soul in <HI>Hell,</HI> but a less love unto him, to contract his happiness in his triumph.</P>
<P>I protest, that in this or any other point, I am not possest with a spirit of op∣position; and when I am herein satisfied in any good degree, I shall become the Animadvertors thankful Convert in this particular.</P>

<P>To this and to what ensueth in two leaves following I return no answer; not because I am pinched therein with any matter of moment, but for these reasons following.</P>
<P>First, I understand, That the Animadvertors Stationer taketh exception, that I have printed all his book, which may tend to his detriment. Now I pro∣test, when I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst took up this resolution to present the Animadvertors whole <HI>Cloth, List, Fagg</HI> and all, I aimed not at his damage, but my own defence: no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can I see how I could doe otherwise, seeing the plaister must be as broad as the <HI>sore,</HI> the tent as deep as the wound; yea, I have been in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed by prime Sta∣tioners, the like hath formerly been done without exception taken on either side, in the Replies and Rejoynders betwixt Dr. <HI>Whitgift</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> and many others. However, being willing to avoid all appearance of injury, I have left out some observations which I conceived might well be spared, as containing no pungent matter against me.</P>
<P>Secondly, I am confident, That there needs no other answer to these notes, then the distinct and serious perusal of my <HI>Church History,</HI> with the due altera∣tion of favour indulged to all writings.</P>
<P>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stly, What of moment in these notes is omitted by me, relateth to those

<P>From the Articles our Author proceeds unto the Homilies approved in those Articles, and of them he tels us, Fol. 75. <HI>That if they did little good, they did little harm.</HI>] With scorn and insolence enough. Those Homilies were so composed, as to instruct the people in all positive Doctrines necessary for Chri∣stian men to know, with reference both to Faith and Manners; and being <HI>penned in a plain style,</HI> as our Author hath it, were fitter for the edification of the com∣mon people, than either the <HI>strong lines</HI> of some, or the <HI>flashes</HI> of vain <HI>wit</HI> in o∣thers, in these latter times, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>With scorn and insolence I defie the words. The Animadvertor might have added my words immediately following, <HI>viz.

<P>And well had it been for the peace and happiness of the Church, if the <HI>Ani∣madvertor</HI> (and all of his Party) had had as high an esteem as the <HI>Author</HI> hath, for the Homilies, If none of them had called them <HI>HOMELY HOMILIES,</HI> (as one did,) And if they had conformed their practise to the second Homilie in the second Book, and not appeared so forward in countenancing Images of God and his Saints in Churches.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Author proceeds. Fol. 76. <HI>The English Bishops conceiving themselves im∣powred by their Canons, began to shew their authority, in urging the Clergy of their Diocess to subscribe to the Liturgy, Ceremonies and Discipline of the Church, and such as refused the same, were branded with the odious name of Puritans.</HI>] Our Author having given the Parliament a power of confirming no Canons, as before was shewed, he brings the Bishops acting by as weak Authority in the years 1563. &amp; 1564. there being at that time no Canons for them to proceed upon for re∣quiring their Clergy to <HI>subscribe to the Liturgies, Ceremonies, and Discipline of the Church</HI>: And therefore if they did any such thing, it was not as they were <HI>im∣powred by their Canons,</HI> but as they were inabled by that Authority which was inherent naturally in their Episcopal Office.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But whereas he tels us in the following words, that the name of <HI>Puritan</HI> in that <HI>notion</HI> began this year, <HI>viz.</HI> 1564. I fear he hath anticipated the time a little, <HI>Genebrard</HI> a right good <HI>Chronologer</HI> placing it <HI>(ortos in Anglia Puritanos)</HI> a∣bout two years after, <HI>Anno</HI> 1566, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answer, First, Let the Animadvertor keep his fears <HI>for me</HI> to himself, and not be solicitous in my beha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f.</P>
<P>Secondly, If the time be anticipated but <HI>a little,</HI> these <HI>necessary Animadversi∣ons</HI> needed not to take notice thereof.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Genebrards</HI> placing the beginning of the Name Puritan, <HI>about two years</HI> after, intimates a latitude in his Computation.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91"/>Fourthly, <HI>Genebrard Anno</HI> 1566. calleth them <HI>ortos</HI> [but not <HI>orientes</HI>] <HI>in An∣glia Puritanos:</HI> And when I speak of the beginning of the name, I relate to it <HI>rising,</HI> not <HI>risen.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Genebrard</HI> is so disaffected to our Religion, he is not to be credited, taking all implicitly out of rayling <HI>Saunders:</HI> Witnesse this eminent Note a∣mongst the rest, <HI>Anno</HI> 1570. <HI>UNCTI in</HI> Surria <HI>Comitatu</HI> Angliae, è Calvinii <HI>Schola o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iuntur; qui docent peccare neminem nisi qui veritatem ab ipsis praedicatam non re∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pit. The ANOINTED Scholars of</HI> Calvin <HI>did rise this year in</HI> Surry, <HI>an English County; who teach, that every man must sin that will not imbrace their Doctrine:</HI> all which is a notorious untruth.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Animadvertor cannot justly be angry with me if I antedated the Puritans by two years, seeing he findeth the Lineaments of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a c.</HI> 2. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> Puritan Plat∣form in the Reign of King <HI>Henry the eighth,</HI> twenty years at least be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore my men∣tion of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But why our Author should call the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Londons House</HI> by the name of the <HI>Popes Palace,</HI> I doe very much wonder; unlesse it were to hold conformity with the style of <HI>Martin Mar-Prelate,</HI> and the rest of that Faction. Amongst whom nothing was more common than to call all Bishops <HI>Petty-Popes,</HI> and more parti∣cularly to call the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>London, Pope</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>London.</HI> But I hope more charitably than so, being more wil∣ling to impute it to the fault of the Printers, than the Pen of our Author, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I cannot close with the Animadvertor in his uncharitable censure of the <HI>Mi∣nistery</HI> of forain Protestant Churches, rendring them utterly invalid, because ordained by no Bishops. <HI>Cain</HI> (as commonly believed) is conceived to have killed a fourth part of mankinde by murthering <HI>Abel</HI>; but the Animadver∣tors cruelty to Protestants hath exceeded this proportion, in spiritually killing more than a fourth part of Protestants, according to his own principles: For if no Priests in <HI>France, Low Countries, Swisserland,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>then no Sacraments; then no Church; then no Salvation.</HI></P>

<P>Fol. 228. <HI>Some</HI> (saith he) <HI>embraced them as ancient truths consonant to Scripture, long disused and neglected, now seasonably revived for the encrease of piety.</HI>] Amongst which some, he that shall take our Author for one, will not be much mistaken ei∣ther in the man, or in the matter. For that he doth approve <HI>Bounds</HI> Doctrines in this particular, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Animadvertor imposeth on me that which is contrary to my Judgemens.</P>
<P>I am not of Dr. <HI>Bounds</HI> Opinion, who straineth the Sabbath too high; yea the Animadvertor when writing against Mr. <HI>Le strange,</HI> maketh use of above twenty lines out of my Book against him.</P>
<P>I am of the judgement of moderate men, as I have clearly and largely stated it in my <HI>Church-History,</HI> and will live, and desire to dye in the main∣tenance thereof. And I hope the Animadvertor will allow me to know my own judgement bet∣ter than he doth.</P>
<P>I am not of the Ani∣madvertors mind, That the Lords day is alterable and of meer Ecclesiastical constitution; much less dare I concur with him in his <HI>scandalous expression, That the late</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his Adver∣tisemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s on the History of King <HI>Charles, p.</HI> 64.</NOTE> <HI>Parliament hath by their Orders and Ordinances laid greater</HI> restraints on People <HI>than ever the Scribes and Pha∣rises did on the Iews.</HI></P>
<P>To what followeth in the Animadvertor concerning the Articles at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> I return no other answer, save this: As a Historian I have written truly for mat∣ter of Fact; And if as a Divine, I have interposed something of my Judgement in those points, I beleeve the Animadvertor, if writing on the same subject, would not appear more moderate. Mean time, I am sure he differs as much from me, as I from him in these opinions; and therefore I see no reason of his animositie on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds.

For who did ever hear of any Elms in <HI>Westminster Or∣chard,</HI> or to say truth, of any <HI>Elms</HI> in any Orchard wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soever of a late Planta∣tion? <HI>Elms</HI> are for Groves, and Fields, and Forests, too cumbersom and over∣spreading to be set in Orchards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>When a Traveller on the High-way suddenly returns back again, surely 'tis to fetch some matter of moment, which he hath forgotten and left behind him. The Animadvertor in this his Note, retreats above 50 pages in my <HI>Church-History, viz.</HI> from <HI>fol.</HI> 233. to <HI>fol.</HI> 179. And what is this Retrograde motion for? Even to carpe at <HI>Elmes,</HI> which I say were set by Abbot <HI>Feckenham</HI> in the Orchard of the Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> citing my Author <HI>Reynerius</HI> for the same; whose words <HI>in horto,</HI> I translate <HI>in the Orchard,</HI> as more proper for Elmes than a <HI>Garden.

<HEAD>THE TENTH BOOK. Containing the Reign of King <HI>James.</HI></HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>OUr Author proceeeds. Fol. 5. Watson <HI>with</HI> William Clark <HI>(ano∣ther of his own profession) having fancied a notional Treason, imparted it to</HI> George Brooks.] To these he after adds the Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> a Pro∣testant, the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddon</HI> a Puritan, and Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> an able Statseman, and some other Knights.</P>
<P>In the recital of which names our Author hath committed a double fault, the one of omission, and the other of commission. A fault of omission, in leaving out Sir <HI>Griffith Markam,</HI> as much concerned as any of the principal actors, de∣signed to have been <HI>Secretary of Estate,</HI> had the Plot succeeded, and finally ar∣raigned and condemned at <HI>Winchester,</HI> as the others were.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I distinguish betwixt <HI>total Omission, express Enumeration,</HI> and <HI>implicit Inclusion.</HI> Sir <HI>Griffith Markam</HI> cannot be said to be <HI>omitted</HI> by me, because included in that clause, <HI>and some other Knights.</HI> Yea this whole treason had not at all sound any mention in my History (not being bound to take cognizance thereof) save for the two <HI>Priests,</HI> who were engaged therein.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>His fault of commission is, his calling the <HI>Lord Gray</HI> by the name of the <HI>Lord Gray</HI> of <HI>Whaddon</HI> (a fault not easily to be pardoned in so great an Herald) where∣as indeed though <HI>Whaddon</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> was part of his Estate, yet <HI>Wilton</HI> in <HI>Herefordshire</HI> was his <HI>Barony</HI> and ancient Seat; his Ancestors being call'd <HI>LL. Gray</HI> of <HI>Wilton,</HI> to difference them from the <HI>Lord Gray</HI> of <HI>Reuthen,</HI> the <HI>Lord Gray</HI> of <HI>Codnor, &amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fault not so great neither in an Herauld, seeing I call him not <HI>Lord Gray Baron</HI> of <HI>Whaddon,</HI> but of <HI>Whaddon</HI>; and a noble Person may be <HI>additioned</HI> either from his <HI>Honour</HI> or his <HI>Habitation.</HI> Besides <HI>Wilton</HI> in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> long since being run into ruin, those <HI>Lords,</HI> some <HI>sixscore</HI> years agoe, removed their residence to <HI>Whaddon</HI> in <HI>Bucks</HI> where some of them lived, died, and are bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</P>
<P>The Animadvertor made as great an omission in his <HI>Short view of K. Charles,</HI> when mentioning his Tutor Mr. <HI>Murrey,</HI> but quite leaving out Sir <HI>Iames Fuller∣ton,</HI> conjoyned with him in the same charge of the Princes education. And a greater fault of Commission is he guilty of, when taxing Mr. <HI>Murrey</HI> as disaffe∣cted to the <HI>English Church,</HI> who when made Provost of <HI>Eaton</HI>▪ took his oath and therein professed his good liking of our Discipline, as in the <HI>Cabala</HI> doth appear.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Whaddon</HI> the Animadvertor might have spared this his <HI>Note,</HI> who in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 2. <HI>li.</HI> 14.</NOTE> <HI>Postcript</HI> annexed to this <HI>Book,</HI> maketh <HI>Edward Lord Montagu</HI> created <HI>Baron</HI> of <HI>Broughton</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI> Now though the <HI>L.

<PB N="94" REF="94"/>
Lands therein; yet is he Baron of <HI>Boughton</HI> in the same County. A mistake so much the greater in the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> because done in his <HI>Emendation</HI> of his <HI>Emendations</HI> of the <HI>faults</HI> of another, so that he cannot <HI>hit it right</HI> in this his <HI>third endeavor.</HI> This I had passed over in silence, had not his <HI>cruelty</HI> on my <HI>Pen</HI> or <HI>Presse</HI>-slips occasioned me to take notice thereof.</P>

<P>Here are four Gradations of <HI>Fullers, good, better, best, best of all,</HI> which in the language of jeering (speaking alwayes by the contraries, amounteth unto <HI>bad, worse, worst, worst of all.</HI> As for the first <HI>T. Fuller,</HI> I answer; First, the <HI>tale</HI> is <HI>not made,</HI> but <HI>related</HI> by me, who have charged my <HI>Margin</HI> with the <HI>Author</HI> thereof, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hist. Eccle∣siast. seculo de∣cimo quinto, pag.</HI> 646.</NOTE><HI>Harpsfeild,</HI> not inconsiderable for Learning &amp; Religion amongst his own party. Secondly, not the least credit is given thereunto in my reporting it, matching it with another <HI>miracle,</HI> which I call <HI>equally true,</HI> that is <HI>equally untrue</HI> in the inter∣pretation of any <HI>unpartial Reader.</HI> Thirdly, seeing I followed <HI>Harpsfeild</HI> in re∣lating his <HI>Miracles</HI> in other places; if here I should have deserted him, probably it would have been by others condemned in me for a <HI>sullen omission,</HI> as by the <HI>Ani∣madvertor</HI> for a light <HI>Insertion,</HI> because <HI>T. F.</HI> was my <HI>Namesake.</HI></P>
<P>The good nature and pittiful disposition of Dr. <HI>I. Fuller</HI> plainly appeareth in Mr. <HI>Fox</HI>; and as for his bounty to <HI>Iesus Col.</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> I leave it to some of that foundation to give testimony thereof.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>third N. Fuller,</HI> be it reported to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 17.12</NOTE> <HI>IESSES</HI> of <HI>Grayes-Inne,</HI> I mean such <HI>Benchers as pass amongst them for Old Men,</HI> and can distinctly remember him, whether he hath not left a pretious and perfumed memory behinde him, of one <HI>pious</HI> to <HI>God, temperate</HI> in <HI>himself, able</HI> in his <HI>Profession, moderate</HI> in his <HI>Fees, care∣full</HI> for his <HI>Client, faithfull</HI> to his <HI>Friend, hospital</HI> to his <HI>Neighbour, pittifull</HI> to the <HI>Poor,</HI> and <HI>bountifull</HI> to <HI>Emanuel Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge:</HI> in a word blamless in all things, save this one <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Indiscretion, which could not make him forfeit the reputation of his honesty,</HI> especially seeing he paid dear for it, and died in durance. Thus though <HI>Mr. Stubbs</HI> was so obnoxious to the displeasure of <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Right-hand</HI> was cut off, for writing a <HI>Libel</HI> against <HI>Her Match</HI> with <HI>Mon∣seir</HI>; yet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>In his Elizab.

<P>I hope he will not condemn all those who approve not those <HI>Notes,</HI> for <HI>K Iames,</HI> who in the <HI>Conference at Hampton Court,</HI> did first declare that of all the Translation of the Bible into the <HI>English</HI> tongue, that of <HI>Geneva was the worst</HI>; And secondly, that the Notes upon it were <HI>partial, untrue, seditious, and savouring too much of dangerous and traiterous conceits.</HI> For proof whereof his Majesty in∣stanced in two places, the one on <HI>Exod.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 19. where disobediance to the King is allowed of: The other in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 8.15, 16. where <HI>Asa</HI> is <HI>taxed for de∣posing his Mother only, and not killing Her</HI>: A note, whereof the <HI>Scottish Presbyte∣rians</HI> made special use, not only <HI>deposing Mary</HI> their lawfull Queen from the Re∣gal Throne, but prosecuting Her openly, and under hand, till they had took away her life. These instances our Author in his <HI>Summary</HI> of that <HI>Confererence,</HI> hath passed over in silence, as loath to have such blemishes appear in the <HI>Gene∣vians,</HI> or their Annotations: And I hope also that he will not advocate for the rest.</P>

<P><HI>Promise</HI> (say the <HI>Genevians</HI>) in their Note, <HI>Matthew</HI> 5.12. <HI>ought not to be kept where Gods Honour and preaching of his Truth is hindred, or else it ought not to be bro∣ken.</HI> What a wide gap, think we, doth this open to the breach of all Promises, Oathes, Covenants, Contracts, and Agreements, not only betwixt man and man, but between Kings and their Subjects? What Rebel ever took up Arms without some pretences of that nature? What Tumults and Rebellions have been rais'd in all parts of Christendom, in <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, France,</HI> the <HI>Netherlands, Germany,</HI> and indeed where not? under colour that Gods <HI>honour, and the preaching of the truth is hindred</HI>? If this once pass for good sound Do∣ctrine,
<PB N="97" REF="95"/>
Neither the King nor any of his Good Subjects, in what Realm soever, can live in safety. <HI>Gods Honour</HI> and the <HI>preaching of his Truth</HI> are two such pretences, as will make void all Laws, elude all Oaths, and thrust out all Covenants and agree∣ments, be they what they will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I behold this <HI>Note</HI> as <HI>impertinent</HI> to that place, seeing it appears not in the Text, that those <HI>wise men</HI> made <HI>Herod</HI> any promise to return unto him. Secondly, Had they made him any promise, yea bound it with an <HI>Oath by the living God,</HI> such an <HI>Oath</HI> had not been <HI>obligatory,</HI> because God (to whom the <HI>forfeiture</HI> was due) <HI>re∣leased</HI> the <HI>Band</HI> in an extraordinary Vision, unto them such, that our Age doth not produce.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Note</HI> is <HI>impertinent</HI> in that place, so it is <HI>dangerous</HI> at all times; and mans corruption may take thence too much mischievous advantage, which is partly gi∣ven, because so <HI>perilous a pit</HI> is left open (contrary to the <HI>Iudicial</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 21.33.</NOTE> <HI>Law</HI>) and not covered over with <HI>due caution</HI> requisite thereunto.

<P>Next I would have our Author tell me, what he thinks on this Note, on the ninth of the <HI>Revelation, vers.</HI> 3. where the <HI>Locusts</HI> which came out of the <HI>smoak</HI> are said to be false <HI>Teachers, Hereticks, and wouldly subtil Prelats, with Monks, Fri∣ers, Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Doctors, Batchelours, and Masters.</HI> Does not this Note apparently fasten the Name of Locusts on all the Clergy of this Realm, that is to say, Archbishops, Bishops, and all such as are graduated in the University by the name of Doctors; Batchelours, and Masters? And doth it not as plainly yoke them with Friers, Monks, and Cardinals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>It was in my opinion both <HI>indiscretly</HI> and <HI>uncharitably</HI> done, to <HI>jumble</HI> them to∣gether, being of so <HI>different</HI> (not to say <HI>contrary</HI>) <HI>originations.</HI> Sure I am, though they are pleased to <HI>match them</HI> by force, yet the <HI>Parties</HI> were never <HI>agreed.</HI></P>
<P>They might as well have added <HI>Superintendents, Lecturers, Assistants,</HI> and whole <HI>Classesses</HI>; seeing all such, it <HI>victous</HI> in <HI>Life,</HI> or <HI>Heretical</HI> in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> (not∣withstanding their <HI>reformed Names</HI>) are <HI>Locusts</HI>▪ as <HI>well</HI> (that is, as <HI>ill</HI>) as any of the other.</P>
<P>But let us return to those my words which first gave the first occasion to these four last <HI>Animadversions.</HI>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Church-History, 10 Book, Page 59.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And as about this time, some perchance over-valued the <HI>Geneva Notes,</HI> out of the especial love they bare to the <HI>Authors</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> whence they proceeded; soon the other side,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>In the Margin this Note Dr</HI> H <HI>in</HI> Ox∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>causlesly inveyeth a∣gainst the</HI> Ge∣neva <HI>Notes.</HI></NOTE> some without cause, did sleight, or rather without charity, did slander the same: For in this or the next year a Doctor in solemn assembly in the University of <HI>Oxford</HI> publickly in his Sermon at <HI>St. Maries,</HI> accused them as guilty of mis-interpretation touching the <HI>Divinity</HI> of Christ; and his <HI>Messiah-ship,</HI> as if symbolizing with <HI>Arrians</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> against them both. For which he was afterwards suspended by <HI>Dr. Robert Abbot propter conciones publicas minus Orthodoxas &amp; offensionis plenas.</HI></P></Q></P>

<P>And first it is to be observed, that though he was then Dean of <HI>Westminster</HI> when the custody of the Great Seal was committed to him; yet was he not <HI>then</HI> and <HI>still Dean</HI> of that Church, that is to say, not Dean thereof at such times as our Author writ this part of the History: For <HI>fol.</HI> 80. speaking of <HI>Dr. Halls</HI> return from the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Dort, Anno</HI> 1618. he adds, that <HI>he continued in health till this day, thirty three years after,</HI> which falls into the year 1651. And certainly at that time <HI>Dr. Williams</HI> (then <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>York</HI>) was not Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> that place being bestowed by his Majesty on <HI>Dr. Steward</HI> Clerk of the Closet, <HI>Anno</HI> 1645. being full six years before the time our Author speaks of.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I have learnt from the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> which I knew not before, and I thank him for it. The great distance of <HI>Exeter</HI> (where I lived) from <HI>Oxford,</HI> may partly excuse my ignorance therein; who alwaies beheld <HI>Archbishop Williams</HI> as the last <HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>Westminster:</HI> as indeed he was the last that ever was <HI>instauled</HI> therein. And Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> never lived minute in, or gained farthing from his <HI>Dean∣ship.</HI> So <HI>umbratile</HI> a Dignity is not worth the contending for.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, Whereas our Author tells us, that the place was proper <HI>not for the plain but guarded Gown</HI>; I would fain know how it should be more proper <HI>for the guarded Gown</HI> than it was for the plain. There was a time when the Chancellors (as our Author telleth us elsewhere) were alwaies Bishops; and from that time till the fall of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> that Office continued for the most part in the hands of the Prelates: at what time, that great Office was discharged with such a ge∣neral contentment, that people found more expedition in their Suits, and more ease to their purses than of later times. By which it seems that men who are <HI>ne∣ver bred to know the true grounds and reasons of the Common Law,</HI> might and could mitigate the rigor of it in such difficult cases as were brought before them; the Chancery not having in those dayes such a mixture of Law as now it hath, nor be∣ing so tyed up to such intricate Rules as now it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to return in opposition to the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> in his endeavouring to make a <HI>Clergy-man</HI> proper to be <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as, <HI>as well qualified As any Common-Lawyer for the Place.</HI> Nor if I could, would I disprove what tendeth to the Honour of my Profession. The <HI>little toe</HI> is advanced when the
<PB N="99" REF="96"/>
<HI>Head</HI> is Crowned, as a Member of the same Body; and my meannesse is sensible of some honour, that any of my Calling are put in a capacity of so high a Prefer∣ment. Onely I request, that if the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> be advanced to the Place, and if I have a cause brought before him, that he would be pleased to hear it <HI>cum omni favore</HI> on this consideration, that he put me to much trouble in answering his <HI>caus∣lesse Cavils</HI> against my <HI>Church-History.</HI></P>
<P>Give me leave to add, that I suspect the <HI>Common-Lawyers</HI> will take advantage from the last words of the Animadvertor, confessing the Court of Chancery now more <HI>intricated</HI> and <HI>mingled</HI> with Law, than in former Ages. Hence I fear they will infer, that <HI>Clergy-men</HI> (though they were heretofore) will not hereafter be so able and fit to discharge that Office. But let us proceed.</P>

<P>But thirdly, whereas our Author in advocating for the Common Lawyers, prescribeth for them a Succession of six Descents, he hath therein confuted him∣self, and saved me the trouble of an Animadversion, by a Marginal Note; in which he telleth us, that <HI>Sir Ch. Hatton was not bred a Lawyer.</HI> If so, then neither was the <HI>Title</HI> so <HI>strong,</HI> nor the Proscriptions so well grounded as our Author makes it; the interposition of Sir <HI>Christopher Hatton</HI> between Sir <HI>Tho.

<P>I prescribe not for the <HI>Common-Lawyers</HI> whose words are, <HI>the Common-Law∣yers</HI> (and those I assure you knowing enough in this their own Art) <HI>prescribed for six Descents.</HI> The <HI>Marginal note</HI> was <HI>entred</HI> by me, a little to <HI>check,</HI> for (say they) it doth not <HI>confute</HI> their <HI>prescription.</HI> Alledging that Sir <HI>Christopher Hatton,</HI> though not bred so professed a <HI>Lawyer,</HI> as to be called to the <HI>Bar,</HI> was admitted in one of the <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> and wore no <HI>plain</HI> but a <HI>guarded Gown</HI> in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> as some still alive doe remember.</P>

<P>He could not hope to mend his fortunes by his coming hither, or to advance himself to a more liberal entertainment in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than what he had attained to in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Covetousness therefore could not be the motive for leaving his own Estate, of which he had been possessed 14. years in our Authors reckoning, to betake himself to a strange Country, where he could promise himself nothing but protection and the freedome of consci∣ence. Our Author might have said, with more probability, that covetousness, and not conscience, was the cause of his going hence, no bait of profit or prefer∣ment being laid before him to invite him hither, as they were both, by those which had the managing of that designe, to allure him hence▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Our Author cannot be so great a stranger in the shops of <HI>London,</HI> as not to know that <HI>Trades-men</HI> use to ask many times twice as much for a Commodity, as they mean to take; and therefore may conclude as strongly, that they doe not mean to sell those wares for which they ask such an unreasonable price at the first demand. <HI>Iniquum petere, ut aequum obtineas,</HI> hath been the usual practise (especially in driving State-bargains) or all times and ages.

<P>But well fare our Author for all that; who finally hath absolv'd the <HI>Spaniard</HI> from this breach, and laid the same upon King <HI>Iames,</HI> despairing of any restituti∣on to be made of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> by the way of Treaty.</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Whereupon King</HI> James <HI>not onely broke off all Treaty with</HI> Spain, <HI>but also called the great Councel of his Kingdom together.</HI>] By which it seems, that the breaking off of the Treaty did precede the Parliament. But <HI>multa apparent quae non sunt,</HI> every is not as it seems. The Parliament in this case came before, by whose con∣tinual importunity and solicitation, the breach of the Treaties followed after. The King lov'd peace too well to lay aside the Treaties, and engage in War before he was desparate of successe any other way than by that of the Sword, as was assur'd both of the hands and hearts of his subjects to assist him in it. And therefore our Author should have said, that the King not onely called together his <HI>great Coun∣cel,</HI> but broke off the Treaty, and not have given us here such an <HI>Hysteron Proteron,</HI> as neither doth consist with reason, nor the truth of story.</P>

<P>To be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a <HI>Covenant-breaker,</HI> is a foul fault, as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom</HI> 1.31.</NOTE> Apostle accounteth it: Far be it from me to charge it causlesly on any, especially on a dead Christi∣an, especially on a King, especially on King <HI>Iames,</HI> generally represented <HI>over-fond of Peace,</HI> and therefore the more improbable first to infringe it.</P>

But when it was found, that he had <HI>more of the Serpent in him, than of the Dove</HI>; and that he was not tractable in steering the Helm of his own Party by the Court-Compass, he was dis∣countenanced and laid by, as not worth the keeping.

The Priests who came over with the Queen were by agreement to be all of the <HI>Oratorian</HI> Order, as less suspected by the English, whom they had never provok'd, as had the <HI>Iesuits,</HI> (and most other of the Monastick Orders) by their mischie∣vous practises. But these <HI>Oratorians</HI> being sent back with the rest of the French, <HI>Anno,</HI> 1626. and not willing to expose themselves to the hazard of a second expulsion, the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> under <HI>Father Ioseph,</HI> made good the place. The breach with <HI>France,</HI> the action at the Isle of <HI>Rhee,</HI> and the losse of <HI>Rochel,</HI> did all occur, before the <HI>Capuchins</HI> were thought of, or admitted hither. And thirdly, some years after the making of the Peace between the Crowns, (which was in the latter end of 1628. and not before) the Queen obtain'd, that these Friers might have leave to come over to her, some lodgings being fitted for them in <HI>Somerset-house,</HI> and a new Chappel then and there built for her Devotion.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, f. 121. <HI>The Bishop of</HI> Lincoln, Lord Keeper, <HI>was now daily descendant in the Kings favour; who so highly distasted him, that he would not have him, as Dean of</HI> Westm. <HI>to perform any part of his Coronation.</HI>] As little truth in this as in that before. For first, the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> was not <HI>Lord Keeper</HI> at the time of the Coronation. Secondly, if he had been so, and that the King was so distasted with him, as not to suffer him to assist at his Coronation; how came he to be suffered to be present at it in the capacity of Lord Keeper? For that he did so, is affirmed by our Author, saying, <HI>That the King took a scrowl of parchment out of his bosome, and gave it to the Lord Keeper</HI> Williams, <HI>who read it to the Commons four severall times, East, West, North, and South,</HI> fol. 123. Thirdly, the Lord Kee∣per, who read that Scrole, was not the Lord Keeper <HI>VVilliams,</HI> but the Lord Keeper <HI>Coventry</HI>; the Seal being taken from the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and commit∣ted to the custody of Sir <HI>Thomas Coventry,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> before. And therefore fourthly, our Author is much out, in placing both the Coronation, and the following Parliament, before the change of the Lord Keeper; and sending Sir <HI>Iohn Suckling</HI> to fetch that Seal, at the end of a Parliament in the Spring, which he had brought away with him before <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Term. But as our Au∣thor was willing to keep the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI> in the Deanry of <HI>Westminster,</HI> for no less then five or six years after it was confer'd on another; so is he as de∣sirous to continue him Lord Keeper for as many months, after the Seal had been entrusted to another hand.</P>

<P>This also is an errour, I neither can nor will defend the Lord Keeper <HI>Willi∣ams,</HI> put for the Lord Keeper <HI>Coventry,</HI> which hath betrayed me to some con∣sequentiall incongruities.

I write not this to accuse him, but in part to excuse my self, by paralleling mine with as evident a mistake. I hope my free <HI>confession</HI> of my fault, with promise of <HI>emendation</HI> of It (and the Appendants thereof) in my next <HI>Edition,</HI> will meet with the Reader's <HI>absolution.</HI> And let the Animadvertor for the pre∣sent (if so pleased) make merry, and feast himself on my <HI>mistake,</HI> assuring him, that he is likely to fast a long time hereafter.</P>

<P>My Heraldry is right both in Place and Time. The Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> as <HI>Earl Marshall,</HI> went after the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> as Lord <HI>High Constable,</HI> though going before him. For <HI>Barons</HI> went (in this Royall Procession, at the Kings Co∣ronation) before <HI>Bishops, Bishops</HI> before <HI>Viscounts, Viscounts</HI> before <HI>Earls,</HI> the <HI>meaner</HI> before the <HI>greater</HI> Officers of State. Thus the Lord Constable (though the <HI>last</HI>) was the <HI>first,</HI> because, of all Subjects, nearest to the person of the Soveraign. It seemeth the dayes were very long when the Animadvertor wrote these causless cavills, which being now grown very short, I cannot af∣ford so much time in confuting them.</P>
<P>This his cavilling mindeth me, of what he hath mistaken in his Geography. For, the younger son of an English Earl comming to <HI>Geneva,</HI> desi∣red a <HI>Carp</HI> for his dinner, having read in the Doctor's Geography, that the <HI>Lemman Lake</HI> had plenty of the Fish, and the best and biggest of that kind. The people wondred at his desire of such a dainty, which that place did not afford; but told him, That they had <HI>Trouts</HI> as good and great, as any in <HI>Europe.</HI> Indeed, learned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>De Piscibus in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce</HI> Trutta.</NOTE> <HI>Gesner</HI> doth observe, that the <HI>Trouts</HI> caught in this <HI>Lake, sent</HI> to, and sold at <HI>Lions,</HI> are mistaken for <HI>Salmons</HI> by <HI>strangers,</HI> unacquainted with their proportions. It seems the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s Pen is so much given to <HI>cavil∣ling,</HI> that he turned <HI>Trouts</HI> into <HI>Carps</HI> though none of them so great, as this his <HI>CARP</HI> at me, for making the <HI>Lord Marshall</HI> to go before the <HI>Lord Constable,</HI> at the King's Coronation.</P>

But that the Lord Viscount <HI>Dorcester</HI> was the other of them, I shall never grant, there being no such <HI>Viscount</HI> at the time of the Coro∣nation. I cannot say, but that Sir <HI>Dudley Carlton</HI> might be one of those which held up the Train, though I am not sure of it. But sure I am, that Sir <HI>Dudley Carlton</HI> was not made Baron of <HI>Imber-court,</HI> till towards the latter end of the following Parliament of <HI>Anno</HI> 1606. nor created <HI>Viscount Dorcester</HI> untill some years after.</P>

to depart from it. I am so far from making the <HI>Coronation</HI> of the <HI>Soveraign</HI> de∣pend on the <HI>consent</HI> of his <HI>Subjects,</HI> that I make not the <HI>Kingly power</HI> depend on his <HI>Coronation,</HI> who, before it, and without it, is lawfull and effectuall <HI>King</HI> to all purposes and intents. This was not a <HI>consent</HI> like that of the <HI>Bride</HI> to the <HI>Bride-groom,</HI> the want whereof doth null the <HI>Marriage</HI>; but a meer <HI>ceremoniall</HI> one, <HI>in majorem Pompam</HI>; which did not make, but manifest; not constitute, but declare his <HI>power</HI> over his <HI>people.</HI> So that the <HI>King</HI> got not one single <HI>mite</HI> of <HI>Title</HI> more, than he had before this <HI>four-fold Acclamation.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And this I call piece of new <HI>State-Doctrine,</HI> never known before, because I find the contrary in the Coronation of our former Kings. For in the form and manner of the Coronation of King <HI>Edward</HI> 6. described in the <HI>Catalogue of Ho∣nour,</HI> set forth by <HI>Thomas Mills</HI> of <HI>Canterbury, Anno</HI> 1610. we find in thus.
<Q>The King being carried by certain noble Courtiers in another Chair, unto the four sides of the Stage, was by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> declared unto the people (standing round about) both by Gods and Mans Lawes, to be the right and lawfull King of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and proclaimed that day to be Crowned, Consecrated, and Annointed: unto whom he deman∣ded, Whether they would obey and serve, or not? By whom it was again with a loud cry answered, God save the King, and, Ever live his Majesty.</Q>
The same we have in substance, but in fewer words, in the Coronation of King <HI>Iames,</HI> where it is said, that
<Q>The King was shewed to the People, and that they were required to make acknowledgement of their allegiance to his Majesty by the Arch-Bishop; which they did by acclamations.</Q>
Assuredly, the difference is exceeding vast betwixt <HI>obeying</HI> and <HI>consenting</HI>; betwixt the Peoples <HI>acknowledging their alliegance and promising to obey and serve their lawfull Soveraign,</HI> and <HI>giving their consent</HI> to his Coronation, as if it could not be per∣formed without such <HI>consent.</HI></P>

<Q><P>Acknowledging their <HI>allegiance</HI> to their <HI>Soveraigne.</HI></P>
<P>Giving <HI>consent</HI> to his <HI>Coronation.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> endeavours to widen the <HI>distance</HI> betwixt them, and make the difference <HI>vast, yea, exceeding vast,</HI> against the <HI>will</HI> of the words, vvhich are well inclined to an agreement, there being a <HI>Vicinity,</HI> yea, <HI>Affinity,</HI> betvvixt them, since such who vvill not acknowledge their <HI>Allegiance, will not give-consent</HI> to his <HI>Coronation</HI>; and such vvho <HI>will consent</HI> thereunto, will acknowledge their <HI>allegiance.</HI></P>
<P>I refer my self wholly in this difference to the <HI>Arbitration</HI> of Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> the same <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Edition</HI> cited by the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> who speaking of the <HI>anti∣ent form</HI> of the <HI>Coronation</HI> of the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in reference to this passage, thus expresseth himself.</P>

<P>Small, I am sure, is the <HI>difference</HI> betwixt <HI>consenting</HI> and <HI>good-liking.</HI> Howe∣ver, the <HI>Kings Coronation,</HI> though <HI>following after,</HI> did not <HI>depend</HI> on such <HI>consent, good-liking,</HI> or <HI>acknowledging</HI> of <HI>Allegiance</HI>; seeing amongst our <HI>English Kings,</HI> an <HI>Vsurper's Title</HI> was not the better with, nor a <HI>lawfull Prince's</HI> the <HI>worse</HI> without, such ceremonies of State.</P>

<P>My language in the latter Books forbeareth such <HI>personall passages,</HI> on the <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Posterity,</HI> which in his life-time were, as consistent with my <HI>loy∣alty,</HI> as since inconsistent with my <HI>safety.</HI> I will instance in one of them.

<P>Some of whose Offspring [<HI>King</HI> Iohn<HI>'s</HI>] shall flourish, in free and full power on the <HI>English Throne,</HI> when the <HI>Chair of Pestilence</HI> shall be burnt to ashes; and neither <HI>Tripple Crown</HI> left at <HI>Rome</HI> to be worn, nor any <HI>Head</HI> there which shall dare to wear it.</P></Q></P>
<P>But if the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> or any by him employed, can in any my <HI>nine last Books</HI> discover a <HI>syllable,</HI> sounding to the <HI>disparagement</HI> of the <HI>Kings person</HI> or <HI>power,</HI> to any impartiall Ear, let me, who so long <HI>fed</HI> on the <HI>King</HI>'s large diet, be justly <HI>famished</HI> for my <HI>unthankfulnesse.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Buchanan,</HI> as I <HI>admire</HI> his <HI>Poetry,</HI> so I <HI>dislike</HI> his <HI>Divinity,</HI> especially in this point; desiring that his <HI>Principles</HI> may never come South the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> and, if offering it, may be drowned in their passage.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, f. 123. <HI>Then as many</HI> Earls <HI>and</HI> Barons <HI>as could conveniently stand about the Throne, did lay their hands on the Crown on his Majesty's head, protesting to spend their bloods to maintain it to him and his lawfull Heirs.</HI>] A promise faithfully performed by many of them, some losing their lives for him in the open field, others exhausting their Estates in the defence of his, many more venturing their whole fortunes by adhering to him to a confiscation: A Catalogue of which last we may find subscribed to a Letter, sent from the Lords and Com∣mons of Parliament assembled in <HI>Oxford,</HI> to those at <HI>Westminster, Anno</HI> 1643. And by that Catalogue we may also see, what and who they were, who so
<PB N="7" REF="102"/>
ignobly brake faith vvith him: all those whose names we find not in that sub∣scription, or presently superadded to it, being to be reckoned amongst those, who instead of spending their blood <HI>to maintain the Crown to Him, and to his lawful Successors,</HI> concurred vvith them either <HI>in opere,</HI> or <HI>in voto,</HI> who despoiled him of it. And to say truth, they were revvarded as they had deserved, the first thing which was done by the House of Commons (after the King, by their means, had been brought to the fatall Block) being to turn them out of povver, to dissolve their House, and annul their priviledges, reducing them to the same condition vvith the rest of the Subjects.</P>

<P>I behold all this <HI>Paragraph</HI> as a <HI>Letter</HI> sent to me vvhich requires no An∣swer, (onely I bear the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> witnesse, that it is delivered) seeing I was none of the <HI>Lords</HI> on either Side. But I am not altogether satisfied in the <HI>Adequation</HI> of the <HI>Animadvertor's Dichotomy</HI> to all the <HI>English Nobility,</HI> That all not subscribing the <HI>Catalogue</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> must instantly be concluded on the <HI>op∣site Party</HI>; believing, that upon serious search, some Lords would be found in their <HI>Minority,</HI> and not necessarily reducible to either of these heads.</P>

<P><HI>Footsteps of his moderation, content with the</HI> enjoying <HI>without the</HI> enjoyning <HI>their private practices and opinions on others.</HI>] This comes in as an inference onely on a former passage, in which it is said of <HI>Bishop Andrews,</HI> that <HI>in what place soever he came, he never pressed any other Ceremonies upon them, than such as he found to be used there before his comming.</HI> Though othervvise condemned by some for many superstitious Ceremonies and superfluous Ornaments used in his private Chappell. How true this is, I am not able to affirm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> (if so disposed) might soon have satisfied himself in this point, being Beneficed in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> the last Diocesse of <HI>Bishop Andrews.</HI> And though his institution into his Living was since the death of that worthy Pre∣late, yet his information in this particular had been easie, from the aged Clergy of his Vicinage. Sure I am, he ever was inquisitive enough in matters, vvhi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h might make for his advantage; so that his not <HI>denying,</HI> tantamounteth to the <HI>affirming</HI> of the matter in question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am less able (if it should be true) to commend it in him. It is not certainly the office of a carefull Bishop, onely to leave things as he found them, but to re∣duce them, if amiss, to those Rules and Canons, from which, by the forward∣ness of some to innovate, and the connivance of others at the innovations, they had been suffered to decline.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I comply cordially with the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> in all this last Sentence. Only I add, That it is also the office of a good Bishop, not to endeavour the Alteration of things well setled before. This was the constant practice of Doctor <HI>Andrews,</HI> successively Bishop of <HI>Chichester, Ely,</HI> and <HI>Winchester,</HI> who never urged any o∣ther Ceremonies, that what which he found there. Now whereas the <HI>Anim∣advertor</HI> saith, that <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this should be true, he is not able to commend it in him</HI>; the matter is not much, seeing the actions of <HI>Bishop Andrewes</HI> are able to commend themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And for the Inference it selfe, it is intended chiefly for the late Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>; against whom he had a fling before in the fourth Book of this
<PB N="8" REF="103"/>
History, not noted there, because reserved to another place, of vvhich more hereafter. Condemmed here <HI>for his want of moderation, in enjoyning his private practices and opinions on other men.</HI> But first, our Author had done well to have spared the man, vvho hath already reckoned for all his errours, both vvith God and the vvorld.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>He hath so, and I hope, what he could not satisfie in himself, was done by his Sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our. But first, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> had done wel to have spared his censure on my intentions, except he had better assurance of them. Here I must, <HI>Reader,</HI> appeal to an higher than thy self, Him vvho can <HI>read</HI> the secrets of my heart, before whom I protest, That in this passage I did not reflect in any degree on the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> To make this the more probable, knovv, the Articles of his Visitation vvere observed to be as moderate, as any Bishops in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here let me enter this <HI>Memorable,</HI> and let the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> confute it, if he can. There was a designe of the thirty six Dissenters (of whom hereafter) in the <HI>Convoca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion,</HI> to obtain, that these Articles of his Visitation might be <HI>pre∣ceden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tall</HI> to all the Bishops in <HI>England,</HI> as being in themselves in offensive, and containing no Innovations. This was by some communicated to <HI>Arch-Bishop Laud,</HI> who at first seemed to approve thereof; and how it came afterwards to miscarry, I am not bound to discover.</P>
<P>I confess, this my expression did eye another person, related to Bishop <HI>An∣drewes,</HI> whom I forbear to name, except by the <HI>Animadvertor's</HI> reply unto me I be forced thereunto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And secondly, it had been better if he had told us, what those <HI>private practi∣ses</HI> and <HI>opinions</HI> were, which the Arch-Bishop, with such want of <HI>moderation,</HI> did <HI>enjoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> on others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are reckoned up in my <HI>Church-History, Book</HI> 11. <HI>pag.</HI> 174. <HI>parag:</HI> 47 <HI>&amp;</HI> 48. This is direction enough, and there one may find more then a <HI>good many</HI> of such <HI>opinions</HI> and <HI>practises.</HI> On the self-same token, that it was discreetly done of the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> to pass them over in silence, without a word in their defence or excuse. I will not again here repeat them, partly because I will not revive what in some sort is dead and buried; and partly, because I charitably believe, that some engaged therein, and still alive, are since sorry for their over-activity therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For it is possible enough, that the opinions which he speaks of, might be the publick Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> maintained by him, in opposition to those private <HI>opinions,</HI> which the <HI>Calvinian</HI> party had intended to obtrude upon her. A thing complained o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by <HI>Spalato,</HI> who well observed, that many of the <HI>opinions</HI> both of <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> were received amongst us, as part of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Confession</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; which otherwise he acknow∣ledged to be capable of an Orthodox sense. <HI>Praeter</HI> Anglicanam <HI>Confessionem (quam mi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ut mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estam praedicalant) multa video</HI> Lutheri <HI>&amp;</HI> Calvini <HI>dogmata ob∣tinuisse,</HI> as he there objects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not bound to stand to the judgment of <HI>Spalato,</HI> who would not stand to his own judgment; but first in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> then in <HI>body,</HI> went back into <HI>Aegypt.</HI> Lay not such <HI>unsavoury salt</HI> in <HI>my dish,</HI> but cast it to the <HI>Dunghill.</HI></P>

<P>He that reads the <HI>Gag,</HI> and the <HI>Appello Caesarem</HI> of Bishop <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gue,</HI> cannot
<PB N="9" REF="103"/>
but see, that those <HI>opinions</HI> which our Author condemned for <HI>private,</HI> were the true Doctrine of this Church, professed and held forth in the Book of Articles, the Homilies, and the Common-Prayer-Book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>He that reads the Answers returned by severall Divines to the Books of <HI>Bishop Montague,</HI> cannot but see, that they were rather <HI>private opinions,</HI> than the true and professed Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here, <HI>Reader,</HI> I cannot but remember a passage betwixt two Messengers, sent to carry <HI>Defiances</HI> from severall Armies, who, meeting in the mid-way, (though naked, and without Swords, yet) to manifest their zeal to their Cause, fought it out with their <HI>Trumpets,</HI> till, both being well wearied, they went about their businesse, leaving the main successe to be tryed by their Armies.</P>
<P>Historians are beheld in the notion of Heralds. And, seeing the <HI>Animadver∣tor</HI> and <HI>I</HI> have now clashed it with our <HI>Trumpets,</HI> let us leave the rest to be disputed and decided by those learned and pious persons, who publickly in Print have engaged therein, and who have (or may in due tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) meet toge∣ther in bliss and happinesse. <HI>In my Fathers house are</HI> (though no <HI>wall of partition</HI>) <HI>many</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Joh. 14.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE><HI>mansions</HI>; severall receptacles (as some suppose) for <HI>Martyrs, Confessors,</HI> &amp;c. and vvhy not for such, as, dissenting in the superstructures, concur in holy life, and the <HI>fundamentalls</HI> of Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And it is possible enough, that the practices which he speaks of, were not <HI>private</HI> neither, but a reviver of those antient and publick usages, which the Canons of the Church enjoyned, and by the remisness of the late Govern∣ment had been discontinued. But for a justification of the practises (the pri∣vate practises he speaks of) I shall refer him to an Author of more credit with him. Which Author, first, tells us of the Bishops generally,
<Q>That being of late years either careless or indulgent, they had not required, within their Diocesses, that strict obedience to Ecclesiasticall Constitutions, which the Law expected; upon which, the Liturgy began totally to be laid aside, and inconformity the uniform practise of the Church. He tells us, secondly, of Arch-Bishop <HI>Abbot</HI> in particular, That his extraordinary remisness, in not exacting a strict conformity to the prescribed orders of the Church, in point of Ceremony, seemed to dissolve those legall determinations, to their first principle of indifferency, and led in such an habit of inconformity, as the fu∣ture reduction of those tender conscienced mens too-long-discontinued obe∣dience, was interpreted an innovation. And finally, he tells of Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> who succeeded <HI>Abbot</HI> in that See, that, being of another mind and met∣tle, he did not like, that the externall Worship of God should follow the fashion of every private fancy; and what he did not like in that subject, as he was in State, so he thought it was his duty to reform. To which end, in his Metropoliticall Visitation, he calls upon all, both Clergy and Laity, to observe the Rules of the Church.</Q>
And this is that which our Author calls, the <HI>enjoyning of his private practises; private</HI> perhaps in the <HI>private opinion</HI> of some men, who had declared themselves to be professed enemies to all publick Order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have cause to give credit unto <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>H. Le Strange</HI> Esa;</NOTE> him, who, to the <HI>lustre</HI> of his antient and noble <HI>extraction,</HI> hath added the <HI>light</HI> of <HI>Learning,</HI> not as his <HI>profession,</HI> but <HI>ac∣complishment,</HI> whereby he hath presented the Publick with an hansome Hi∣story, likely to prove as acceptable to Posterity, as it hath done to the present Age. The Gentleman, in that his passage, reflecteth onely on such Ceremonies, is stood in force by Canon, but had been disused; with whom I concur. But the controversie in hand is about additionall Ceremonies, enjoyned by no Can∣nons,
<PB N="10" REF="104"/>
(save some mens over-imperious commanding, and others over-officious complying) justly deserving the censure of <HI>private practises.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, fol. 127. <HI>A Commission was granted unto five Bishops,</HI> (<HI>whereof</HI> Bishop Laud <HI>of the</HI> Quorum) <HI>to suspend</HI> Arch-Bishop Abbot <HI>from ex∣ercising his au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hority any longer, because un-canonicall for casuall Homicide.</HI>] Had our Author said, that <HI>Bishop Laud</HI> had been one of the number, he had hit it right, the Commission being granted to five Bishops, <HI>viz.</HI> Dr. <HI>Montain,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> Dr. <HI>Neil</HI> Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> Dr. <HI>Buckeridge</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> Dr. <HI>Howson</HI> Bishop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Laud</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bathe</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI>; or to any four, three, or two of them, and no more then so. Had Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> been of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> his presence and consent had been so necessary to all their Con∣sultations, Conclusions, and dispatch of businesses, that nothing could be done without him; whereas by the words of the Commission, any two of them were impowered, and consequently all of them must be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> as well as he; which every <HI>Iustice's Clerk</HI> cannot chuse but laugh at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will soon <HI>cease</HI> their <HI>laughter</HI> at the sad story I am about to relate. But be it premised, that here I use the word <HI>Quorum</HI> not in the <HI>legall strictness</HI> there∣of, but in that <HI>passeable sense</HI> in common discourse; <HI>viz.</HI> for one so active in a bu∣siness, that nothing is (though it may be) done without him therein.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Writing</HI> for <HI>Arch-Bishop Abbot's suspension</HI> was to be <HI>subscribed</HI> by the <HI>Bishops</HI> aforesaid, the four <HI>Seniors,</HI> viz. <HI>London, Durham, Rochester,</HI> and <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> all declined to set their <HI>hands</HI> thereunto, and (seemingly at the least) shewed much <HI>reluctance</HI> and <HI>regrete</HI> thereat. Then <HI>give me the Pen</HI> (said Bishop <HI>Laud</HI>) and though <HI>last in place, first</HI> subscribed his <HI>name.</HI> Encouraged by whose words and example, the rest, after some demur, did the like.</P>
<P>This was attested to me by him who had best cause to know it, the <HI>aged</HI> and <HI>credible Register,</HI> still alive, who attended in the place upon them. This I for∣merly knew, but concealed it; and had not published it now, if not necessita∣ted thereunto in my just defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor is there any such thing as a casuall <HI>Homicide</HI> mentioned, or so much as glanced at in that Commission, the Commission onely saying,
<Q>That the said Arch-Bishop could not at that present in his own person attend those servi∣ces, which were otherwise proper for his Cognizance and Jurisdiction; and which, as Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> he might and ought in his own person to have performed and executed.</Q>
I am loth to rub longer on this sore, the point having been so vext already betwixt the <HI>Historian</HI> and the <HI>Oservator,</HI> that I shall not trouble it any further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, <HI>casuall Homicide</HI> not <HI>expresly</HI> mentioned, but <HI>implyed</HI> in the Com∣mission. Otherwise what did those words import COULD NOT <HI>in his person attend</HI>? It was not any <HI>indisposition of body,</HI> being then, and some years after, in health; not <HI>impotency in his Intellect,</HI> (caused from the influence of age) who afterwards, when older, discharged this place, (as the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> confes∣eth). Though therefore the <HI>hilt</HI> of Homicide was onely shown, the <HI>blade</HI> was <HI>shaked</HI> in the <HI>sheath.</HI> Sure I am, that some, the nearest about the Arch-Bishop, have informed me, that he interpreted, that UN-COULDING <HI>him,</HI> solely to relate to his <HI>canonicall Irregula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity</HI> on the Accident aforesaid, and was dejected accordingly.</P>

<P>Onely I must crave leave to <HI>rectifie our Author</HI> in another <HI>passage,</HI> relating to that sad accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>To <HI>rectifie</HI> is to make that <HI>streight</HI> which was <HI>crooked</HI> before; and it is an act of no less <HI>charity,</HI> than <HI>skill</HI> and <HI>cunning</HI> well to perform it. Onely <HI>fools,</HI> can be <HI>fond</HI> of their own <HI>deformity.</HI> I do not onely <HI>desire,</HI> but <HI>delight,</HI> to have the <HI>crook∣edness</HI> of my <HI>knowledge streightned,</HI> provided alwaies, <HI>it be done in the spirit of meekness.</HI> But I understand, such as <HI>streighten crooked persons</HI> beyond the Seas, put them to much torture. I likewise fear, that the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> will lay so much <HI>weight of ill words</HI> upon me, that the <HI>profit</HI> I shall reap, will not counter∣vail the <HI>pain</HI> I must endure in my <HI>rectification.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our Author saith, Ibid. <HI>It would be of dangerous consequence to condemn him by the Canons of forrain Councils, which were never allowed any Legislative power in this Land.</HI>] Which words are very ignorantly spoken, or else very improperly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I not foretell aright, that my <HI>rectification</HI> would cost me dear? even the burden of bad words. Here I have a dolefull Dilemma presented unto me, to confesse my self speaking, either <HI>very ignorantly,</HI> or <HI>very improperly.</HI> But might not one of these two VERY's have <HI>very</HI> well been spared? Well, <HI>è malis mini∣mum,</HI> if it must be so, that my choice must be of one of these, let it be rather but <HI>Impropriety,</HI> than <HI>Ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Reader,</HI> I see no necessity of acknowledging either, but that my words are both knowingly and properly spoken; and now to the <HI>triall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For if by <HI>Legislative power,</HI> he means a power of making Lawes, as the word doth intimate, then it is true, That the Canons of forrain Councells had ne∣ver any such power within this Land: But if by <HI>Legislative power</HI> he means, a Power or Capability of passing for Lawes within this Kingdom; then (though he use the word improperly) it is very fals) that no such Canons were in force in the Realm of <HI>England.</HI> The Canons of many forrain Councells, <HI>Generall, Nationall,</HI> and <HI>Provinciall,</HI> had been received in this Church, and incorporated into the body of the Canon-Law, by which the Church proceeded in the ex∣ercise of her Jurisdiction, till the submission of the Clergy to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth. And, in the Act confirmative of that submission, it is said expresly,
<Q>That all Canons, Constitutions, Ordinances, and Synodals Provinciall, as were made before the said Submission, which be not contrary or repugnant to the Laws, Statutes, and Customs of this Realm, nor to the dammage or hurt of the Kings Prerogative Royall, were to be used and executed as in former times, 25 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 19.</Q>
So that unlesse it can be proved, that the pro∣ceedings in this case, <HI>by the Canons of forrain Councels</HI> was either <HI>contrary or re∣pugnant to the Laws and Customs of the Realm, or to the dammage of the Kings pre∣rogative Royall,</HI> There is no dangerous consequence at all to be found therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>By <HI>Legislative power</HI> of the <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>forrain Councels,</HI> I understand their power to subject the <HI>People</HI> of our <HI>Nation</HI> to <HI>Guiltiness,</HI> and consequently to <HI>Penalties,</HI> if found infringing them. Now I say again, such forrain <HI>Canons,</HI> though not <HI>against,</HI> but onely <HI>besides</HI> our <HI>Common Law</HI>; and containing no <HI>re∣pugnancy,</HI> but <HI>disparateness</HI> to the <HI>Lawes</HI> of our <HI>Land</HI>; either never had such
<PB N="12" REF="105"/>
<HI>power</HI> in <HI>England</HI> since the <HI>Reformation,</HI> or else disuse long since hath antiquated it, as to the rigid exercise thereof.</P>
<P>For instance, a <HI>Bishop</HI> I am sure, and I think a <HI>Priest</HI> too, is, in the old <HI>Canons,</HI> rendred <HI>irregular,</HI> for playing a <HI>game at Tables, Dice</HI> being forbidden by the <HI>Ca∣nons.</HI> Yet I conceive, it would be hard measure, and a thing, <HI>de facto,</HI> never done, that such <HI>irregularity</HI> should be charged on him, on that account.</P>
<P>We know it was the project of the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Papall party,</HI> to <HI>multiply Canons</HI> in <HI>Councels,</HI> meerly to make <HI>the more men,</HI> and <HI>men the more obnoxious</HI> unto him, that they might re-purchase their innocence at the <HI>price</HI> of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> I believe, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> himself would be loth to have his <HI>canonicalness</HI> tried by the Test of all <HI>old Canons,</HI> made in <HI>rigorem disciplinae,</HI> yet not contrariant to our <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Customs,</HI> seeing they are so nice and numerous, that <HI>Cautiousnesse</HI> it self may be found an <HI>offendor</HI> therein. I resume my words, That it would be of dangerous consequence to condemn the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> by <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>forrain Councels,</HI> which never obtained power here, either <HI>quoad reatum,</HI> or <HI>poenam,</HI> of such as did not observe them.</P>

<P>Far more mistaken is our Author in the next, when he tells us, fol. 128. <HI>Though this Arch-bishop survived some years after, yet hence-forward he was buried to the world.</HI>] No such matter neither: For, though for a while he stood confined to his house at <HI>Ford,</HI> yet neither this <HI>Confinement,</HI> nor that <HI>Commission,</HI> were of long continuance; for about <HI>Christmas,</HI> in the year 1628. he was restored both to his Liberty and Jurisdiction, sent for to come unto the <HI>Court,</HI> received as he came out of his Barge by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> and by them conducted to the King; who giving him his hand to kiss, enjoyned him not to fail the Councill-Table twice a vveek. After which time we find him sitting as Arch-Bishop in Parliament, and in the full exercise of his <HI>Iuris∣diction</HI> till the day of his death, which happened on <HI>Sunday, August</HI> the 4th. 1633.

<P>Our Author goeth on. Fol. 137. <HI>My pen passing by them at present, may safe∣ly Salute them with a God-Speed as neither seeing nor suspecting any danger in the Designe</HI>] Our Author speakes this of the <HI>Feoffees,</HI> appointed by themselves, for buying<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in such Impropriations, as were then in the hands of Lay-persons. I say, appointed by themselves; because not otherwise authorised, either by Charter from the King, Decree in Chancery, or by Act of Parliament; but on∣ly by a secret combination of the Brother-hood.</P>
<P>But secondly, this will further appear by their proceedings in the businesse, not laying the Impropriations, by them purchased, to the Church or Chappelry to which they had antiently belonged, nor setling them on the Incumbent of the place, as many hoped they would. That had been utterly destructive to their main design, which was not to advantage the Regular and established Clergy, but to set up a new body of <HI>Lecturers</HI> in convenient places, for the pro∣moting of the <HI>Cause.</HI> And therefore having bought an Impropriation, they parcelled it out into annual Pensions of 40 or 50 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> and therewith salared some Lecturers in such Market-Towns, where the people had com∣monly lesse to do, and consequently were more apt to Faction and Innovation, than in other places. Our Author notes it of their Predecessors, in <HI>Cartwrights</HI> dayes, that they preached most diligently in <HI>populous places; it being observed in</HI> England, <HI>that those who hold the</HI> Helm <HI>of the</HI> Pulpit, <HI>alwayes steer peoples hearts as they please, Lib.</HI> 9. <HI>fol.</HI> 195. And he notes it also of these <HI>Feoffees,</HI> that in con∣formity hereunto, they set up a Preaching Ministry in places of greatest need; not in such Parish-Churches, to which the Tithes properly belonged, but where they thought the Word was most wanting, that is to say, most wanting to advance their project.</P>
<P>Thirdly, if we behold the men whom they made choice of, and employed in preaching in such Market-Towns as they had an eye on, either because most populous, or because capable of electing Burgesses to serve in Parliament, they were for the most part <HI>Non-conformists,</HI> and sometime such as had been silen∣ced by their Ordinary, or the High-commission, for their Factious carriage. And such an one was placed by <HI>Geering,</HI> one of the Citizen-Feoffees, in a Town of <HI>Glocestershire</HI>; a fellow which had been outed of a Lecture neer <HI>Sandwich</HI> by the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> out of another in <HI>Middlesex</HI> by the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> out of a third in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> by the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> out of a fourth in <HI>Hartfordshire</HI> by the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and finally suspended from his Ministry by the High-Commission; yet thought the fittest man by <HI>Geering</HI> (as indeed he was) to begin this Lecture.</P>
<P>Fourthly and finally, these Pensions neither were so setled, nor these Lectu∣rers so well establisht in their severall places, but that the one might be with∣drawn, and the other removed, at the will and pleasure of their Patrons, if they grew slack and negligent in the <HI>holy cause,</HI> or abated any thing at all of that fire and fury they first brought with them. Examples of which I know some, and have heard of more. And now I would fain know of our Author, whether there be no <HI>danger</HI> to be <HI>seen</HI> or <HI>suspected</HI> in this <HI>design</HI>; whether these Feoffees in short time would not have had more Chaplains to depend upon them, than all the Bishops in the Kingdom; and finally, whether such needy fellowes de∣pending
<PB N="14" REF="106"/>
on the will and pleasure of their gracious Masters, must not be forced to Preach such Doctrines onely as best please their Humours. And though I shall say nothing here of their giving under-hand private Pensions, not onely unto such as had been silenced or suspended in the Ecclesiasticall Courts, but many times also to their wives and Children after their decease, all issuing from this common-stock: yet others have beheld it as the greatest piece of Wit and Artifice both to encourage and encrease their Emissaries, which could be possibly devised. If, as our Author tels us, <HI>fol.</HI> 143. <HI>The Design was generally approved, and that both discreet and devout men were doleful at the ruine of so pious a Project</HI>; it was because they neither did suspect the danger, nor foresee the mischiefs, which unavoidably must have followed, if not crusht in time.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, fol. 148. <HI>However, there was no Express in this Decla∣ration, that the Ministers of the Parish should be pressed to the publishing.</HI>] Our Au∣thor doth here change his style. He had before told us, That on the first publi∣shing of the Declaration about lawfull Sports on the Lords Day, no <HI>Minister</HI> was, <HI>de facto,</HI> enjoyned to read it in his Parish, <HI>lib.</HI> 10. <HI>fol.</HI> 76. and here he tells us, that there was no express order in the Declaration, (when reviv'd by King <HI>Charls</HI>) that the Minister of the Parish should be prest to the publishing of it; adding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithall, that many thought it a more proper work for the Con∣stable or Tithing-man, than it was for the Minister. But if our Author mark it well, he may easily find, that the Declaration of King <HI>Iames</HI> was commanded to be published <HI>by order from the Bishop of the Diocess, through all the Parish-Churches</HI> of his Jurisdiction. And the Declaration of King <HI>Charls</HI> to be published with like order <HI>from the severall Bishops, through all the Parish-Churches of their seve∣rall Diocesses respectively. The Bishop of the Diocess</HI> in the singular number, in the Declaration of King <HI>Iames,</HI> because it principally related to the County of <HI>Lan∣caster The Bishops</HI> in the plurall number, in that of King <HI>Charls,</HI> because the be∣nefit of it was to be extended over all the Realm. In both, the Bishops are commanded to take order for the publishing of them in their severall Parishes; and whom could they require to publish them in the Parish Churches, but the Ministers onely? The <HI>Constable</HI> is a <HI>Lay-Officer,</HI> meerly bound by his place to ex∣ecute the Warrants and Commands of the <HI>Iustices,</HI> but not of the <HI>Bishop.</HI> And though the Tithing-man have some relation to Church-matters, and conse∣quently to the Bishop, in the way of <HI>presentments</HI>; yet was he no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bound to exe∣cute any such Commands, because not tyed by an <HI>Oath of Canonicall Obedience,</HI> as the Ministers were. So that the Bishops did no more than they were com∣manded, in laying the Publication of these Declarations on the backs of the Ministers▪ and the Ministers by doing less than they were required, infring'd the Oath which they had taken, rendring themselves thereby obnoxious to all
<PB N="15" REF="106"/>
such Ecclesiasticall Censures, as the Bishops should inflict upon them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said, That there was no <HI>Express order</HI> in the Declaration, that the Minister of the Parish should be <HI>pressed to the publishing of it.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath done me the favour, to prove my words to be true, acknowledging the Declaration onely enjoyned, <HI>That the Bishop of the Dio∣cess should order the publishing thereof, through all the Parishes in his Iurisdiction</HI>: And so <HI>consequently</HI> (as the Animadvertor <HI>inferreth</HI>) the Ministers must do it. Hereby the truth of my words do appear, that there was no <HI>express command,</HI> seeing an EXPRESS, and an INFERENCE are two things of a different nature.</P>
<P>Whereas I said, <HI>That many thought it a more proper work for the Constable or Tithing-man, then for the Minister.</HI> There are thousands now alive which will justifie the truth thereof. Yea, their <HI>thoughts</HI> (which otherwise I confess came not under my cognizance) expressed themselves in their <HI>words,</HI> wherewith they affirmed and professed the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It seems that in our Authors judgment, it was well done by the Judges for the County of <HI>Somerset,</HI> to impose upon the Ministers of that County (over whom they could challenge no authority) to publish their own Declarations against <HI>Wakes</HI> and <HI>Feasts</HI>; and that it was well done of the Ministers to obey the same, for which see <HI>fol.</HI> 147.] These Bishops are beholden to him, for giving greater power to the <HI>Iudges</HI> and <HI>Iustices</HI> over his brethren of the Clergy, then he yields to them; and as much beholden are the Clergy, for putting so many <HI>Masters</HI> over them instead of a <HI>Father.</HI> The difference of the case will not serve the turn, the King having a greater power to indulge such freedom to his Subjects, then the others could pretend unto, to restrain them from it. If he ob∣ject, that <HI>the Ministers are most unfit to hold the Candle, to lighten and let in licenti∣ousness,</HI> as he seems to do; he must first prove, that all, or any of the sports al∣lowed of, in those Declarations, may be brought within the compass of licen∣tiousness, which neither the Word of God, nor the Canons of the Christian Church, nor any Statutes of the Realm had before forbidden. Lastly, whereas he tells us, That <HI>because the Iudges had enjoyned the Ministers to read their Order in the Church, the Kings Declaration was enforced by the Bishops to be published by them in the same place.</HI>] There is no such matter. The Declaration of King <HI>Iames</HI> appointed to be read, and read by order of the Bishop in the Parish Churches, doth evince the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not say, The Judges <HI>did well,</HI> or <HI>did ill</HI> therein; but I said, The Judges <HI>did order,</HI> that the Ministers should publish their Declaration against <HI>Wakes</HI> and <HI>Feasts.</HI> I have not (nor can quickly procure) a copy of their order, whether it were <HI>mandatory</HI> or, <HI>by way of advice,</HI> did desire <HI>Ministers</HI> to do that, which might be advantagious to Religion. But I vvill not <HI>judge the Iudges,</HI> but leave them (as best skilled in their own faculty) to make good their own acts.</P>
<P>If such <HI>Grandees</HI> in the Law exceeded their <HI>bounds</HI> in this their <HI>injunction</HI> to <HI>Ministers,</HI> (over whom they had no command) how many mistakes should I run into, if once offering to meddle with this matter, being out of my <HI>profession</HI>? And therefore no more thereof.</P>

<P>Now for our Authors better satisfaction in the present point, I shall lay down the judgment of one so high in his esteem, (and once in the esteem of that party too) that I conceive he will not offer to gainsay him. It is the Au∣thor of the Book, called the <HI>Holy Table, Name, and Thing,</HI> vvho resolves it thus:
<Q><PB N="16" REF="107"/><HI>All the commands of the King</HI> (saith he) that are not upon the first inference and illation (without any Prosyllogisms) contrary to a clear passage in the Word of God, or to an evident Sun-beam of the Law of Nature, are pre∣cisely to be obeyed. Nor is it enough to find a remote and possible inconve∣nience that may ensue therefrom; (which is the ordinary objection against the Book of Recreations) for every good subject is bound in conscience to be∣lieve and rest assured, that his Prince (envi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oned with such a Councell) will be more able to discover, and as ready to prevent any ill sequel, that may come of it, as himself possibly can be. And therefore I must not by dis∣obeying my Prince commit a certain sin, in preventing a probable but con∣tingent inconveniency.</Q>
This if it were good Doctrine then, when both the Author and the Book were cryed up even to admiration, is not to be rejected as false Doctrine now; truth being constant to it selfe, not varying nor alte∣ring with the change of times.</P>

<P>I want no satisfaction, I thank God, in the point; and therefore the <HI>Anim∣advertor</HI> might have spared his pains. As an Historian, I have truly related, <HI>de facto,</HI> what vvas done; and though the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> may conjecture at my judgment in this controversie, he cannot be confident thereof by any thing I have vvritten.</P>
<P>All I will add is this, Because <HI>I may write the more, I will write the lesse</HI> of this subject. I have good povver to back me for the present in this controversie, and might securely express my self therein.</P>
<P>When my Text shall lead me in my <HI>Vocation</HI> to treat of the <HI>Observation of the Lords Day,</HI> I shall not be sparing to express my opinion therein, and will en∣deavour (God-vvilling) to justifie it. Mean time, I vvill not go out of mine own <HI>house, which is my castle</HI>; I mean, I will not be drawn out into the <HI>open field</HI> of a controversie, but keep my self under this COVER, That mat∣ters of fact in this difference have been truly related by me: and let the <HI>Anim∣advertor</HI> disprove it if he can.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But our Author will not stop here, he goes on and saith,</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Many moderate men are of opinion, that this abuse of the</HI> Lords-day <HI>was a principal procurer of Gods anger, since poured out on this Land, in a long and bloudy Civill war.</HI>] And <HI>moderate</HI> perhaps they may be in apparell, diet, and the like civil acts of life and conversation; but sure, <HI>immoderate</HI> enough in this Obser∣vation: <HI>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een his Counsellor, saith the great</HI> Apostle? But it is as common with some men of the newest Religions, to adscribe Gods secret judgements to some speciall Reasons, as if they had the Key which opens into his Cabinet at their severall Girdles; as if they were ad∣mitted to all Consultations in the Court of Heaven, before that dreadfull Judge could inflict any temporall Punishment upon Men on Earth. Otherwise they might find the Nation guilty of too many sins, which drew down this ven∣geance, to adscribe it unto any one sin, (if a sin it were;) and rather wonder at Gods mercy, patience, and long-suffering, in deferring his punishments long, then that he inflicted them at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I behold them <HI>as Moderate men</HI> in all Respects. The Animadvertor hath used my words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 10.4.</NOTE> as the King of <HI>Ammon</HI> dealt with the cloaths of <HI>David's</HI> Embassa∣dours, even cutting them off at the middle. Otherwise, might they have but hung down to the ground, no nakednesse had appeared in what I have written, proceeding as followeth;
<Q><BIBL><HI>Church History, Book 11. page 148.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Such Moderate Men observe that our sights of chief Concernment, [Edge Hill &amp;c.]
<PB N="17" REF="107"/>
were often sought on the Lords-Day, <HI>as pointing</HI> at the punishing of the Profanation thereof.</P></Q></P>
<P>See here the Reason assigned of their Opinion, as I received it from their mouths. Since, they say, It is one thing with the <HI>Beth-shemites</HI> to pry into the Ark, and another thing, to look on. God <HI>Secrets,</HI> in some sort <HI>un-secreted,</HI> when by the Proportion of his Judgments, he sayeth <HI>Come</HI> and <HI>see.</HI> These also al∣ledge for themselves, that the Patriarks, sensible of their hard usage from the Governour of <HI>Egypt,</HI> did not pry into Gods Mysticall Pleasure, when conclu∣ding it inflicted on them, for their Cruelty to their Brother <HI>Ioseph; Therefore is this distresse come upon us.</HI> However I wholly concurre with the Animadvertor in his last Sentence, as truly and savourly written. Onely I dissent from Him, in that Passage,
<Q><L>(if a Sin it were;)</L></Q></P>
<P>Surely, He meaneth not, <HI>if the Profanation of the Lords-Day were a Sin,</HI> which is above all <HI>Iff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> Rather his sense is, If the using of such Sports were a <HI>Profanation of the Lords Day.</HI></P>
<P>But mens Corruption is more prone to acquit themselves when guilty, than to suspect themselves when guiltless.
<Q><L>Parce precor Stimulis, &amp; fortiùs utere Loris.</L>
<L>Spurs I pray refrain;</L>
<L>Rather use the Reine.</L></Q></P>
<P>I need not mind the Animadvertor, how penal it is by the late Act, for any to write any thing against the strict Observation of the Lords Day; and believe, he Intended nothing Prejudiciall to the same: yet Profaness probably too soon (besides his intention) may improve it selfe on his words, alter his <HI>Si</HI> into <HI>Non</HI>; and by the <HI>next Return,</HI> turn his note of <HI>Dubitation</HI> into an absolute <HI>Negation,</HI> on which account the <HI>Parenthesis</HI> had been better forborn, in my Opinion.</P>

<P>And though our Author doth object against this <HI>Opinion</HI> of those <HI>Moderate men,</HI> that <HI>to pick a solemn Providence out of a common Casualty, savours more of curi∣osity then conscience,</HI> yet he dares not stand to it; confessing within few lines af∣ter, that <HI>there may be more in the Observation than what many are willing to acknow∣ledge.</HI>] If so, there may be as much <HI>conscience</HI> as <HI>curiosity</HI> in the <HI>Moderate Men.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds Folio 151. <HI>If moderate men had had the managing of these matters about the Posture of the Lords Board (call it Table or Altar) the Accommo∣dation had been easie with a little Condescention on both sides.</HI>] Why then did not these <HI>moderate</HI> men interpose themselves for taking off those <HI>needless Animosities,</HI> and putting an end unto the Quarrell? The Presse was open on both sides; <HI>Iohn, Lincoln, Deane of Westminister,</HI> who appear'd so strongly in the Cause, thinking himselfe as well able and well qualified to license a Book unto the Presse, as either the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> or the Bishop of <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>I said it, and say it again, and any who have <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> (the <HI>Ani∣madvertor</HI> only excepted) will say so too; that those differences were easily capable of <HI>Accommodations</HI> with a little <HI>Condescention</HI> on both sides. It will not belong before the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> will tell us, that the Controversies betwixt us
<PB N="18" REF="108"/>
and the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> (consisting most, as he saith, in <HI>Superstructures</HI>) may be comprimised: <HI>and if</HI> (to use his owne Words) <HI>the Petulancy of the Puritans on the one side, and the Pragmaticalness of the Iesuites on the other side were charmed a while, moderate men might possibly have agreed on equall tearmes.</HI></P>
<P>Now this seemeth a strange thing to me, that <HI>moderation</HI> may make <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> agree with <HI>Papists</HI> in <HI>matters Doctrinall</HI>; and cannot make <HI>Protestants</HI> agree with <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>matters Ceremoniall.</HI> Being the <HI>same plaister,</HI> why hath it not <HI>equall vertue</HI>; especially, the <HI>latter</HI> being the <HI>lesser wound</HI>? Can the <HI>difference</HI> of <HI>Transubstantiation</HI> be taken up betwixt us and the <HI>Papists,</HI> and not the <HI>setting</HI> of the <HI>Communion-Table</HI> betwixt our selves? Can a <HI>crack</HI> be <HI>closed</HI> in a <HI>Iewell,</HI> and a <HI>rent</HI> not <HI>mended</HI> in the <HI>Case</HI>? These things I confess transcend my ap∣prehension.</P>
<P>Now that no <HI>moderate man stood up in the gap</HI> to make up this <HI>breach,</HI> I can assigne no other cause, save, That God, justly offended with our Nation, had not so great a favour for it, but suffered a <HI>Pustle</HI> to <HI>fester</HI> into an <HI>Ulcer</HI>; not from any <HI>insanability</HI> in the <HI>soar,</HI> but want of <HI>seasonable Surgery</HI>; and let the guilt thereof (that the burden may be the better born) be equally divided, betwixt both parties engaged therein.</P>

And therefore the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> fighting with his own shaddow, it is all one to me whether he <HI>beat</HI> or be <HI>beaten.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I doubt not, but there are many in this <HI>Nation,</HI> my <HI>betters</HI> in all re∣spects, who will be bold to call it a <HI>Trifling controversie,</HI> if not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>solutely,</HI> yet <HI>comparatively,</HI> to many <HI>Doctrinall differences</HI> of higher concernment; and, in re∣spect of the <HI>great troubles</HI> caused thereby, far above the <HI>considerablenesse</HI> of the thing which was in <HI>contest.</HI></P>

<P>The question was about the placing of the <HI>Communion-Table,</HI> whether it ought to stand in the middle of the <HI>Church,</HI> or <HI>Chancel,</HI> with <HI>one end</HI> towards
<PB N="19" REF="108"/>
the <HI>East</HI> great <HI>Window,</HI> like a <HI>common Table</HI>; or close up to the <HI>Eastern-wall,</HI> with <HI>ends North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> according as the <HI>Altars</HI> had been placed in the former times. They that maintained the last opinion, had <HI>Authority</HI> for it, that is to say, the <HI>Injunctions</HI> of the Queen, <HI>Anno</HI> 1599. the Orders and Advertisements of the year 1562. and 1565. the constant practice of the Chappels in his Ma∣jestie's Houses, most of the Cathedrall, and some of the Parochiall Churches; and finally, a Declaration of the King, <HI>Anno</HI> 1633. commending a conformi∣ty in the Parish-Churches to their own Cathedralls. They on the other side stood chiefly upon discontinuance, but urged withall, that some Rubricks in the Common-Prayer-Book seemed to make for them. So that the question be∣ing reduced to a matter of fact, that is to say, The Table must stand this way, or it must stand that way; I would fain know, how any <HI>Condescention</HI> might be made on either side, tending to an accommodation, or what our Moderator would have done to atone the differences.</P>

<P>The Dr. hath <HI>clearly, briefty,</HI> and <HI>truly</HI> stated the Controversie, whose pen was formerly conversant therein, and by his owne acknowledgment both sides had much to say for themselves.</P>
<P>Onely I wonder that though the Question was reduced <HI>to matter of Fact,</HI> it should be made by him of so high Importance; That either no <HI>condiscention</HI> could be made on either side, or such <HI>Condiscention</HI> (if made) must prove in∣effectuall as to an <HI>accommodation.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose him sitting in the Chair, the Arguments on both sides urged, and all the Audience full of expectation which side would carry it. The Moderator <HI>Fuller</HI> of old merry Tales then ordinary, thus resolves the businesse, That he had heard it commended for a great piece of wisdom in Bishop <HI>Andrews,</HI>
<Q>That wheresoever he was a Parson, a Dean, or a Bishop, he never troubled Parish, Colledge, or Diocesse, with pressing of other Ceremonies upon them, than such which he found used there before his comming thither.</Q>
That King <HI>Iames</HI> finding the Archbishop of <HI>Spalato</HI> in a resolution of questioning all such Leases, as had been made by his Predecessors in the <HI>Savoy,</HI> gave him this wise counsell, <HI>Relinque res sicut eas invenisti</HI>; That he should leave things as he found them. That the said King being told by a great Person, of the <HI>in∣verted scituation of a Chappel in Cambridge,</HI> made answer, That it did not <HI>matter how the Chappell stood, so their hearts who go thither were set aright in Gods service.</HI> But for his part, he liked better of the resolution of Dr. <HI>Prideaux,</HI> (his brother in the Chair at <HI>Oxford</HI>) who being troubled with his neighbours of <HI>Kidlington,</HI> about the setting up of a <HI>May-pole,</HI> some being for it, and some against it, thus resolved the case; <HI>You,</HI> saith he, <HI>that will have a May-pole, shall have a May-pole; And you that will have none, shall have none.</HI> And that according to that pattern, he thought best to accommodate the present Controversie to the same effect, <HI>viz.</HI> You that will have an <HI>Altar,</HI> shall set up your <HI>Altar</HI>; and you that will have a <HI>Table,</HI> shall have but a <HI>Table.</HI> Which sentence, whether it would have pleased all parties, I do somewhat doubt; but sure I am, it had not tended to the advancement of that uniformity, which was then designed.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Animadvertor here makes a <HI>Professor's Chaire</HI>; and, having solemnly set me down therein, puts words into my mouth, and makes an Oration for me, as Moderator in the present Controversie, with a jeer to boot on the memory of the Reverend Doctor <HI>Prideaux.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="109"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 1.1.</NOTE>But know, there is another <HI>Chaire,</HI> which <HI>David</HI> calls the <HI>Chaire</HI> of the <HI>scorn∣full</HI>; and it is to be feared, that the Animadvertor in this point is too neare sit∣ting down therein.</P>
<P>If I should retaliate, and accordingly place the Animadvertor in <HI>a Chair,</HI> and fit him with a <HI>Speech</HI> personating him proportionable to his principles, possibly I might render him as Ridiculous, but most of all should abuse my self and my owne profession therein.</P>
<P>I thank God I can, though plainly, yet pertinently enough to my purpose, speak to expresse the notions of my mind. And when God shall take speech from me, (if my reason still remain) I shall rather with <HI>Zacharias</HI> make signes for writing-tables to write in, than to have words put into my mouth, forced and seigned on me by the Animadvertor. Let him thank God that he can speak so well for himselfe. And I will be content as well as I can, to utter my owne conceptions.</P>
<P>It would never have come into my Mind to have compared the Table of the Lord to a May-pole; the Wood of the one grew in Paradise, not so the other, being a light, and Ludicrous, and too often profane, stock of wood. I hope that the principles of my Education will restraine me from prophanesse in such un∣fitting parallels.</P>
<P>Whereas the Animadvertor sayes that an <HI>Expedient would</HI> not have <HI>tended to that Uniformity,</HI> that was designed herein, before <HI>God and Man,</HI> I will speak out my thoughts. That <HI>multiformity</HI> with <HI>mutuall</HI> Charity advanceth <HI>Gods Glory</HI> as much as <HI>Uniformity</HI> it selfe in matters meerly indifferent; which as the Pipes of an Organ may be of severall length and bignesse, yet all tuned into good har∣mony together.</P>
<P>I will instance in the Observation of Easter, the great Controversie betwixt the Easterne and Westerne Church in the Observation thereof; betwixt that which I may call <HI>Style Orientall,</HI> and <HI>Style Occidentall</HI> for the Date thereof. And I verily believe that God was equally honoured by both, by such as Religiously observed it.</P>

<P>But from these <HI>moderate men,</HI> which were so in contemplation onely, let us proceed to one who was such in practise, (the Lord Bishop of <HI>London</HI>) of whom he saith; fol. 150. <HI>He had a perfect command of his passion, an happiness not granted all Clergy-men in that Age, though Privy-Counsellors.</HI>] So perfect a man of his own passion and affections, that he will not think himself honoured with a com∣mendation, which comes accompanied with the disparagement of his chiefest friend; (for that this lash was made for the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> no wise man can doubt.) Our Author might have spared the dead, without any wrong to the living; but that he thinks no <HI>Topick</HI> so usefull in his <HI>Logick,</HI> as the rule of Contraries. <HI>Contraria juxta se posi a magis elucescunt.</HI> Upon which ground, the better to set off Bishop <HI>Andrews,</HI> this poor Archbishop must be charged with want of <HI>moderation, in enjoyning his own private practises and opinions upon other men.</HI> And here, that Bishop <HI>Iuxon</HI> might appear with the greater lustre, the said Arch-bishop with all his passions and infirmities, must stand by for a foil. He had indeed no such command upon his passions, as to be at all times of equall temper, especially when wearied with the businesse of the Councill-Table, and the High-Commission. But as he was soon hot, so he was soon cool'd; and so much is observed by Sir <HI>Edward Dering,</HI> though his greatest ad∣versary, and the first that threw dirt in his face in the late long Parliament; who telleth us of him, that <HI>the roughness of his uncourtly nature sent most men dis∣contented from him; but so, that he would often (of himself) find waies and means to sweeten ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of them again, when they least looked for it.</HI> In this, more modest then our Author; who gives us nothing of this Prelate but his vvants and vveak∣nesses.

<P>There were other Clergy men Privy-Counsellors beside <HI>Arch-Bishop Laud</HI>: Dr. <HI>Abbots, Neil, Harsnet, Williams, &amp;c.</HI> And therefore the Animadvertors Col∣lection of my words cannot be conclusive in Reference to <HI>Arch-Bishop Laud</HI>:</P>
<P>I confesse else where I do reckon Anger amongst his personall imperfections, which a Historian may do without any wrong at all, (The spirit of God saying, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 5.17.</NOTE> <HI>Elias was subject to like passions as we are</HI>); I am confident as angry as Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> was, He would not have bin angry with me for writing of it, as sensible of and sorrowfull for his owne imperfection therein.</P>
<P>I am much of the mind of Sr. <HI>Edward Dering,</HI> that the roughnesse of his un-court-like nature, sweetned many men when they least looked for it, sur∣prizing some of them, (and my selfe for one) with unexpected Cour∣tesies.

<P>If I have run into so many <HI>errours,</HI> it will be charity in the <HI>Animadvertor fairly</HI> to <HI>lead</HI> me back again a <HI>foot-pace</HI> into the <HI>truth,</HI> and then he shall have <HI>thanks</HI> for his pains: alwaies provided, he doth not <HI>pinch</HI> me by the <HI>arm</HI> as he conducteth me, which will turn my <HI>thanks</HI> into <HI>anger.</HI> But seeing the <HI>Animad∣vertor</HI> careth for both alike from my hands, let him do as he pleaseth.</P>
<P>Next we have his <HI>tripartite History</HI> of my <HI>errors,</HI> which he will have to pro∣ceed from one of these three causes.

<P>But seeing now the <HI>Animadvertor's hand</HI> is in his <HI>Arithmetick,</HI> in counting of <HI>causes</HI> of my <HI>mistakes,</HI> his <HI>charity</HI> might have found a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourth,</HI> (worth all the <HI>other three</HI>) and imputed my <HI>errors</HI> to that infirmity, which alwaies attendeth hu∣man nature.

<P>These are ANI-MAD-VERSIONS indeed, when a <HI>Writer's words</HI> are <HI>madly verted, inverted, perverted,</HI> against his true intent, and their Grammaticall sense.</P>
<P>My words run thus, Mr. <HI>William Prin was born</HI> (<HI>about</HI> Bath) <HI>in</HI> Glocester-shire; where <HI>Bath</HI> is <HI>walled</HI> about with a <HI>Parenthesis,</HI> not essentiall to the Sentence, thus perfect without it, <HI>Mr. William Prin was born in Glocester-shire.</HI> These <HI>walls</HI> the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath most dis-ingenuously dismantled, to lay <HI>Bath</HI> open; and, if pos∣sible,

to bring it into <HI>Glocester-shire,</HI> that so he may have something to cavil at me.</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>Bath</HI> is not <HI>in,</HI> but <HI>within</HI> three miles of <HI>Glocester-shire</HI>; and the next eminent place to— the <HI>Village</HI> of Mr. <HI>Prin</HI>'s <HI>nativity.</HI> When Towns stand in the confines of two Counties, is it not proper enough to say, Such a one was born (about <HI>London</HI>) in <HI>Surrey,</HI> though <HI>London</HI> be in <HI>Middlesex</HI>; or (about <HI>Windsor</HI>) in <HI>Buckingham-shire,</HI> though <HI>Windsor</HI> be in <HI>Bark-shire</HI>?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> writing in his own defence, against such as traduced him; <HI>Some,</HI> saith he, <HI>do not cavill, because they have found fault; but do find faults, because they may cavill</HI>: And be it reported to the Reader, whether the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> may be accounted one of them.

<P>Secondly, whereas he saith, that <HI>he began with the writing of some Orthodox Books</HI>] Though I look on Mr. <HI>Prin,</HI> (so far forth as I am able to judge, by some Books of his not long since published) as a man of a far more moderate spirit, than I have done formerly; yet can I not think his <HI>first Books</HI> to have been so <HI>Orthodox</HI> as our <HI>Author</HI> makes them.

<P>But I must and will say something of his <HI>Perpetuity of the Regenerate Man his Estate,</HI> as being that which is particularly named in my Margin, and chiefly intended by me. A <HI>Book,</HI> wherein an <HI>usefull, necessary,</HI> and <HI>comfortable Truth</HI> is learnedly defended. A <HI>Book,</HI> which will <HI>perpetuate</HI> the memory of the Writer; who, had he proceeded, and continued, as he began, none could have <HI>took just exception</HI> at, or <HI>got just advantage</HI> against him.</P>

<P>As for the Books of Mr. <HI>Prin,</HI> entituled, <HI>Lame Giles his Haltings, Cozen's co∣zening Devotions,</HI> and his <HI>Appendix</HI> to another, they have many things repugnant to the Rules and Canons of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> No greater enemy against <HI>howing at the Name of Iesus,</HI> nor greater enemy to some Ceremonies, here by Law established.

<P>Thirdly, the Book called <HI>Histrio-Mastix,</HI> was not writ by Mr.<HI>Prin</HI> a∣bout <HI>three years</HI> before his last sufferings, as our <HI>Author</HI> telleth us, for then it must be writ or published <HI>Anno</HI> 1634. whereas indeed that Book was publi∣shed in Print about the <HI>latter end</HI> of 1632. and the <HI>Author</HI> Censur'd in <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> for some passages in it about the latter end of the year 1633. Other∣wise, had it been as our <HI>Author</HI> tells us, the punishment must have preceded the offence; and he must suffer for a <HI>Book,</HI> which was not publisht at that time, and perhaps not written. But our Author hath a speciall faculty in this kind, which few Writers have.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath a speciall <HI>faculty</HI> in <HI>cavilling</HI> without cause. My <HI>Clock</HI> of <HI>time</HI> strikes <HI>true</HI> enough, but that he is minded not to tell it <HI>aright.</HI> My

words are, <HI>Some three years since</HI>; which word SOME, soundeth an <HI>interpretative plùs minus</HI> to all ingenuous Ears. Besides, this is our opposite marginall Note, (containing the contents of that Paragraph) <HI>Mr. Prin accused for Libelling a∣gainst Bishops</HI>; which accusation was about two years before this his last <HI>Cen∣sure,</HI> (during which time he was imprisoned). And my SOME <HI>three years</HI> are to bear date (in the construction of any impartiall Reader) from that his accu∣sation; and then nothing is <HI>mis-timed,</HI> but falleth out in due season.</P>
<P>And now, Reader, judge, where the many errors be into which I have run, in the <HI>story</HI> of Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> and his <HI>sufferings,</HI> seeing <HI>no one mistake</HI> can be <HI>produced</HI> and <HI>proved</HI> against me. And seeing the <HI>first Book</HI> of Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in it self, in my opinion; and his <HI>last Books</HI> more moderate, even in the judgment of the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>; and his <HI>midling Books</HI> (how faulty soever) such for which he hath severally suffered; let us even take a fair farewell of Mr. <HI>Prin</HI> and his <HI>Books,</HI> and so proceed.</P>

<P>In answer hereunto, May the Reader be pleased to take notice of these par∣ticulars.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The revived controversie, <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> lasted ten years, bandied with books from 1628. till 1638.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I was loath to scatter my Book with it, but resolved on one intire Nar∣rative thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I fixed on the yeare 1633. therein to insert the same, because the mid∣dle Number, from the rising to the sinking of the difference, then came to the very heat and height thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Hence my <HI>Narrative</HI> retreated some years back to 1628. when <HI>Brad∣born</HI> began the difference.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Hence also it sallied forth to the year 1635. (when Bishop <HI>White</HI>'s book was set forth) and beyond it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The date of the yeare 1633. stands still unmoveable on my Margin; the whole Relation, being for the reasons aforesaid entered under it. So that nothing is offered to the Reader unjoynted in Time, if I be but rightly under∣stood.</ITEM>

<P>Next unto Mr. <HI>Prinne,</HI> in the course of his Censure, comes the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>coln,</HI> the cause whereof we have in our Author, who having left a blank, <HI>fol.</HI> 156. for somewhat which he thinks not fit to make known to all, gives some occasion to suspect that the matter was far worse on the Bishops side than perhaps it was. And therefore to prevent all further misconstructions in this businesse, I will lay down the story as I find it thus, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>The Bishop's purgation depending chiefly upon the testimony of one <HI>Pri∣deon,</HI> it happened, that the <HI>February</HI> after, one <HI>Elizabeth Hodson</HI> was delivered of a base child, and laid to this <HI>Prideon.</HI> The Bishop finding his great Wit∣ness charged with such a load of filth and infamy, conceived it would inva∣lidate all his testimony, and, that once rendred invalid, the Bishop could easily prognosticate his own ruine; therefore he bestirs himself amain. And though by order of the Justices at the publick Sessions at <HI>Lincoln, Prideon</HI> was charged as the reputed father, the Bishop by his two Agents, <HI>Powel</HI> and <HI>Owen,</HI> procured that Order to be suppressed; and by subornation and mena∣cing
<PB N="24" REF="111"/>
of, and tampering with, Witnesses; at length in <HI>May,</HI> 10 <HI>Car.</HI> procured the child to be fathered upon one <HI>Boon,</HI> and <HI>Prideon</HI> acquit. Which lewd practises, for the supportation of his favourite's credit, cost the Bishop, as he confest to Sir <HI>Iohn Munson</HI> and others, twelve hundred pounds; so much di∣rectly, and by consequence much more.</Q></P>

<P>I have concealed nothing herein of Moment, (the Blank being in∣significant, and the mere mistake of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Before his Time, he was about to be∣gin a new Section and Dedication as appeares by the TO in Text.</NOTE> Printer) and expect no considerable addition from the Animadvertor, having in my Book truly and clearly stated the Bishops Cause, from the best Records.</P>
<P>I appeal to the unpartiall <HI>Perusers</HI> of what I wrote, whether by this <HI>Note,</HI> any thing of moment is added to the matter in hand, except the naming of a <HI>light houswife,</HI> (which I conceived beneath my <HI>History</HI>) the rest being truly by me related before.</P>

<P>But to proceed: the cause being brought unto a censure, fol. 157. <HI>Secretary</HI> Windebank <HI>motioned to degrade him; which</HI> (saith he) <HI>was lustily pronounced by a Knight and a Lay-man, having no precedent for the same in former Ages.</HI>] But first, it is not very certain that any such thing was moved by Sir <HI>Francis Windebank.</HI> A manuscript of that daies proceedings I have often seen, containing the De∣cree and Sentence, with the substance of every Speech then made; and amongst others, that of Sir <HI>Francis Windebank,</HI> in which I find no motion tending to a Degradation, nor any other punishment inflicted on him, than Fine, Suspen∣sion, and Imprisonment; in which the residue of the Lords concurred, as we find in our Author.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very certain, he moved it, and I avow it from honourable Eyes and Ears. The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> misguides the reference of those my words, [<HI>having no precedent for the same in former Ages,</HI>] making them relate to the <HI>Bishop's De∣gradation,</HI> (whereof one <HI>precedent</HI> since the <HI>Reformation, Unus homo nobis</HI>) which indeed refer to the <HI>Knight's</HI> and <HI>Lay-man</HI>'s first mentioning thereof, which is <HI>unprecedented</HI> I am sure, that such a person should FIRST make such a motion against a Bishop.</P>
<P>I confess, at B<SUP>p</SUP>. <HI>Midleton's</HI> Degradation, some of the <HI>Lay-Privy-Counsellors</HI> were present, but acted little therein, (so, far from FIRST mentioning of it) onely <HI>concurring</HI> with the Court, the matter being chiefly managed by Arch-bishop <HI>Whitgift,</HI> and some other <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deans</HI> the <HI>Commissioners,</HI> as most pro∣per persons to pass such a <HI>censure</HI> on one of their own profession.</P>

<P>Secondly, it had been more strange if the Knight had not been a Lay-man, the Church of <HI>England</HI> not acknowledging any Order of Spirituall Knight∣hood. Knights in Divinity are greater strangers in this Land, then Lay-Divines; these last being multiplied of late, even <HI>ad infinitum</HI>; the first, never heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Pleonasm</HI> of the addition of <HI>Lay-man</HI> to <HI>Knight,</HI> is not so culpable in it self, but that it might have passed without censure; and let not the <HI>Animad∣vertor</HI> be over-confident herein.</P>
<P>I have been credibly informed, that Sir <HI>Miles Sandys,</HI> (third son to <HI>Edwin Arch-bishop</HI> of <HI>York</HI>) Fellow of <HI>Peter-house</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and Proctor of the Uni∣versity, <HI>Anno</HI> 1588. was made a <HI>Deacon,</HI> (and so no <HI>meer Lay-man</HI>) and in his younger years a <HI>Prebendary</HI> of <HI>York.</HI> Within this twenty years there was one
<PB N="25" REF="111"/>
Mr. <HI>Seaton</HI> beneficed in <HI>Hartfordshire,</HI> a Scotish-man, and at this day a Knight. But the matter being of no more moment, let us proceed.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And thirdly, had it been so mov'd, and so <HI>lustily</HI> mov'd, as our Author makes it, the Knight and Lay-man might have found a precedent for it in former ages.</P>
<P>Which last clause is to be understood (as I suppose) with reference to the times since the Reformation: For in the former times, many precedents of like nature might be easily found. And being understood of the times since the Refor∣mation, it is not so infallibly true, but that one precedent of it, at the least, may be found amongst us. <HI>Marmaduke Middleton</HI> advanced to the Bishoprick of Sr. <HI>Davids, Anno</HI> 1567. after he had sat in that See three and twenty years, was finally condemned (for many notable misdemeanors) not onely to be deprived of his Bishoprick, but degraded from all holy Orders. Which sentence was accordingly executed by and before the High-Commissioners at <HI>Lambeth-house,</HI> not only by reading of it <HI>in Scriptis,</HI> but by a formal divesting of him of his Epis∣copall Robes, and Priestly Vestments, as I have heard by a person of good cre∣dit, who was present at it. And somewhat there is further in the story of this <HI>Marmaduke Middleton,</HI> which concerns the <HI>Bishop</HI> now before us; of whom our Author telleth us further, That being prest by two Bishops, and three Do∣ctors, to answer upon Oath to certain Articles, which were tendred to him in the <HI>Tower, he utterly refused to do it, claiming the priviledge of a Peer,</HI> fol. 159. Which plea was also made by the said Bishop of St. <HI>Davids,</HI> offering to give in his Answer to such Articles, as were fram'd against him, <HI>on his Honour</HI> onely, but refusing to do it on his <HI>Oath.</HI> Which case being brought before the Lords, then sitting in Parliament, was ruled against him; it being ordered, that he should answer upon Oath, as in fine he did. To this Bishop let us joyn his Chaplain, Mr. <HI>Osbolstone,</HI> who being engag'd in the same Bark with his Pa∣tron, suffered shipwrack also, though not at the same time, nor on the same occasion; Censured in <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> not onely to lose his Ecclesiasticall Pro∣motions, but to corporall punishments.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my weak judgment, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> had better have omitted this pas∣sage (of this Bishop's <HI>Degradation</HI>) in this juncture of time, where in the <HI>repute</HI> of that <HI>Function</HI> runs very low, and their adversaries too ready to take all ad∣vantage to disgrace it. The rather, because Bishop <HI>Godwin</HI> taketh no notice at all thereof, but <HI>beginneth, continueth,</HI> and <HI>concludeth</HI> the <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death</HI> of this Bi∣shop in lesse then <HI>two lines. Marmaduke Middleton translated from Ireland, died</HI> Novemb. 30th. 1592.</P>

<P>Our Author proceedeth, fol. 166. <HI>But this last personall penalty he escaped, by</HI> going beyond Canterbury, <HI>conceived seasonably gone beyond the Seas, whilst he secretly concealed himself in</HI> London.] And he had scap't the last penalty, had he staid at home. For though Mr. <HI>Osbolston</HI> at that time concei∣ved the Archbishop to be his greatest enemy, yet the Archbishop was resolved to shew himselfe his greatest friend, assuring the Author of these Papers (be∣fore any thing was known of Mr. <HI>Osbolstons</HI> supposed flight) that he would cast himselfe at the Kings feet for obtaining a discharge of that corporal punishment unto which he was sentenced. Which may obtain the greater credit; First, in regard that no course was taken to stop his flight, no search made after him, nor any thing done in Order to his apprehension. And secondly, by Mr. <HI>Os∣bolstons</HI> readinesse to do the Archbishop all good Offices in the time of his troubles, upon the knowledge which was given him (at his coming back) of
<PB N="26" REF="112"/>
such good Intentions. But of these private men enough; passe we now to the publick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether or no he was sought after, I know not; this I know, he was not taken: and more do commend his warinesse in his flight, than would have praised his valour for staying, in hope his Punishment should be remitted. It had been most Mercy to stop the <HI>denouncing,</HI> but was a good <HI>after-game of pitty</HI> to <HI>stay the inflicting</HI> of so cruell a <HI>censure</HI> on a <HI>Clergyman.</HI> As the <HI>Animadvertor, then,</HI> had the <HI>Credit</HI> to know; so the <HI>Author, now,</HI> hath the <HI>Charity</HI> to believe, the Arch-Bishops good resolution.</P>
<P>However I cannot forget, that when the Sentence in the Star-Chamber, passed on Bishop <HI>Williams,</HI> (where he concurred with the highest in his Fine) He publickly professed, that He had fallen <HI>five times down on his knees</HI> before the King in the Bishop's behalf, but to no purpose. It might be therefore suspected that his intention to do it <HI>once</HI> for Mr. <HI>Osbolston</HI> might not have taken effect. And therefore, had the Arch-Bishop's good resolution been known unto him, Mr. <HI>Osbolston</HI> might most advisedly conceale himselfe.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, Folio. 160. <HI>Miseries caused from the sending of the Book of Service, or new Liturgy thither which may sadly be termed a Rubrick indeed dyed with the blood of so many, of both Nations slaine on that Occasion.</HI>] Our Author speakes this in <HI>Relation</HI> to the <HI>Scottish Tumults,</HI> Anno 1637.

<P>Seeing the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> denies the <HI>Liturgy</HI> to have had any Causall <HI>influ∣ence</HI> on the <HI>Scots War,</HI> I must manifest my <HI>dissent</HI> from his <HI>Iudgement</HI>; and here I crave the <HI>Reader's</HI> leave to be his humble <HI>Remembrancer</HI> of the <HI>Kinds</HI> of Causes, so far as they conduce to the clearing of the present <HI>Controversie.</HI></P>
<P>Causes are twofold, <HI>Solitary</HI> or <HI>Totall</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; or <HI>Ioynt</HI> and <HI>fellow Causes</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The <HI>latter</HI> againe is twofold, <HI>Proegumena</HI> [<HI>long leading before</HI>] and inwardly disposing and inclining to Action; or <HI>Procatarctica</HI> (called also <HI>Cau∣sa irritatrix</HI> or <HI>Primitiva provocans</HI>) which is outwardly impulsive to Acti∣on.</P>
<P>The <HI>former</HI> is tearmed by <HI>Physitians, Causa Antecedens</HI>; the latter <HI>Causa Evidens</HI> of a disease. Thus in a <HI>Feaver,</HI> corrupt humours bred <HI>within</HI> and <HI>without</HI> the <HI>Veines,</HI> are the Antecedent cause thereof: whilst, being in the hot <HI>Sun, walking</HI> in the <HI>South-wind</HI> &amp;c. <HI>stopping</HI> the <HI>Pores,</HI> and stirring the ill Humours to heat, may be the <HI>evident cause</HI> of a <HI>Feaver.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="113"/>I thus apply it: The <HI>inward discontents</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> on severall accounts (which follow on the next <HI>Paragraph</HI>) were the <HI>Antecedent causes</HI> of their <HI>War</HI>; whilst the <HI>evident Cause</HI> thereof, was the <HI>Obtruding</HI> the <HI>Liturgy</HI> upon them. And so much for my cleare sense in this Controversie.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Plot had been laid long before upon other grounds, that is to say, Que∣stioning of some Church Lands, then in the hands of some great Persons, of which they feared a Rovocation to the Crown. And secondly, the manumit∣ting of some poor subjects from the tyranny and vassallage which they lived under, in respect of their Tithes, exacted with all cruelty and injustice by those, whom they call the Lords of <HI>new erection.</HI> Which Plot so laid, there wan∣ted nothing but some popular occasion for raising a Tumult first, a Rebellion afterwards; and this occasion they conceived they had happily gain'd, by sen∣ding the <HI>new Liturgy thither,</HI> though ordered by their own Clergy first, as our Author tells us, at the Assembly of <HI>Aberdeen, Anno</HI> 1616. and after a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Perth, Anno</HI> 1618. and fashioned for the most part by their own Bishops also. But of this there hath so much been said between the <HI>Observator</HI> and his <HI>Antagonist,</HI> that there is nothing necessary to be added to it. Secondly, there was no such matter as the <HI>passing of an Act of Revocation, for the restoring of such Lands as had been alienated from the Crown, in the minority of the Kings Predecessors,</HI> of which he tells us, <HI>fol.</HI> 192. The King indeed did▪ once intend the passing of such an Act, but finding what an Insurrection was likely to ensue upon it, he followed the safer counsell of Sir <HI>Archibald Acheson,</HI> by whom he was advis'd to sue them in his Courts of Justice. Which course succeeding to his wish, so terrified ma∣ny of those great persons, who had little else but such Lands to maintain their Dignities, that they never thought themselves secure, as long as the King was in a condition to demand his own. Thirdly, though it be true enough, that <HI>some persons of honour had been denied such higher Titles as they had desired,</HI> fol. 163. yet was it not the denying of such Titles unto <HI>Men of Honour,</HI> which wrought these terrible effects; but the denying of an <HI>honorary Title</HI> to a <HI>man of no honour.</HI> If Colonel <HI>Alexander Lesly,</HI> an obscure fellow, but made rich by the spoils and plunder of <HI>Germany,</HI> had been made a Baron when he first desired it, the rest of the male-contents in <HI>Scotland</HI> might have had an heart, though they had no head. But the King not willing to dishonour so high a Title, by conferring it on so low a person, denyed the favour: Which put the man into such a heat, that presently he joyned himself to the faction there, drove on the plot, and finally undertook the command of their Armies. Rewarded for which notable service with the Title of <HI>Earl of Levin</HI> by the King himself, he could not so di∣gest the injury of the first refusall, but that he afterwards headed their Re∣bellions upon all occasions.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, fol. 163. <HI>Generally they excused the King in their wri∣tings, as innocent therein, but charged Arch-bishop</HI> Laud <HI>as the principall, and Dr.</HI> Cousins <HI>as the instrumentall compiler thereof.</HI>] This is no more then we had reason to expect from a former passage, <HI>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 4. <HI>fol.</HI> 193. where our Author telleth us, that the <HI>Scotish</HI> Bishops withdrew themselves from their obedience to the <HI>See</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> in the time when <HI>George Nevil</HI> was Arch-bishop.

<P>Hence is it, that he takes together all reports which makes against him, and sets them down in rank and file in the course of this History.

The King sets out a Declaration about lawfull Sports, <HI>the reviving and enlarging of which must be put upon his account also, some strong presumptions being urged for the proof thereof,</HI> fol. 147. The reduction of the Church to her antient Rules, and publick Doctrines, must be nothing else but the <HI>enjoyning of his own private practises and opinions upon other men,</HI> fol. 127.

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But what proofs have we for all this? Onely the malice of his enemies, or our Authors own disaffection to him, or some common fame. And if it once be made a fame, it shall pass for truth, and as a truth find place in our Author's History, though the greatest falshood. <HI>Tam facilis in mendaciis fides, ut, quicquid famae liceat fingere, illi esset libenter audire, in my Author's language.</HI> But for the last he brings some proof, (he would have us think so at the least) that is to say, the words of one <HI>Bayly,</HI> a <HI>Scot</HI>; whom it concern'd to make him as odious as he could, the better to comply with a <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> called, <HI>The intentions of the Army</HI>; in which it was declared, That the <HI>Scots</HI> entred <HI>England</HI> with a purpose, to remove the Arch-bishop from the King, and execute their vengeance on him. What hand Dr. <HI>Couzens</HI> had in assisting of the work, I am not able to say. But sure I am, that there was nothing was done in it by the Bishops of <HI>England,</HI> but with the counsel and co-operation of their brethren in the Church of <HI>Scot∣land, viz.</HI> the Arch-bishop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> the Arch-bishop of <HI>Glasco,</HI> the Bi∣shops of <HI>Murray, Ross, Brechin,</HI> and <HI>Dunblane,</HI> as appears by the Book, entituled, <HI>Hidden works of darkness, &amp;c.</HI> fol. 150, 153, 154, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this our Author must needs know, (but that he hath a mind to quarrell the Arch-bishop upon every turn) as appears plainly, 1. By his Narrative of the Designe in King <HI>Iames</HI> his time, from the first undertaking of it by the Arch-bishop of St. <HI>An∣drewes,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Galloway</HI> then being; whose Book corrected by that King, with some <HI>additions, expunctions,</HI> and <HI>accommodations,</HI> was sent back to <HI>Scotland.</HI> 2. By that unsatisfiedness which he seems to have, when the project was resum'd by King <HI>Charls,</HI> Whether the Book by him sent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> were the same which had passed the hands of King <HI>Iames,</HI> or not; which he expresseth in these words, <HI>viz. In the Reigne of King</HI> Charls, <HI>the project was resumed, but whether the same Book, or no, God knoweth,</HI> fol. 160. If so, if <HI>God onely know whe∣ther it were the same or no,</HI> how dares he tell us that it was not? And if it was <HI>the same,</HI> (as it may be for ought he knoweth) with what conscience can he charge the making of it upon Bishop <HI>Laud</HI>? Besides, (as afterward he telleth us, <HI>fol.</HI> 163) <HI>The Church of</HI> Scotland <HI>claimed not onely to be</HI> Independent, <HI>and free as
<PB N="30" REF="114"/>
any Church in Christendom; a Sister, not a Daughter of</HI> England. And consequently the Prelates of that Church had more reason to decline the receiving of a Li∣turgy impos'd on them, or commended to them by the Primat of <HI>England,</HI> for fear of acknowledging any subordination to him; than to receive the same Li∣turgy here by Law establisht, which they might very safely borrow from their Sister-Church, without any such danger. But, howsoever it was, the blame must fall on him who did least deserve it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will return to my words, which gave the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> the first occasion of this long discourse.</P>
<P><HI>Generally they excused the King in their writings, but charged Arch-bishop</HI> Laud.</P>
<P>I do not charge the Arch-bishop for <HI>compiling the Book,</HI> but say, The <HI>Scots</HI> did. Nor do I say, That what they charged on him is true; but it is true, that they did charge it on him. Had I <HI>denyed</HI> it, I had been a <HI>liar</HI>; and seeing I <HI>affirmed</HI> no more, the Animadvertor is a <HI>caviller.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, that when our <HI>Chroniclers</HI> relate, how Queen <HI>Anne Bollen</HI> was charged for Incontinency; <HI>Margaret</HI> Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> for treasonable compliance with the Pope; <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Surrey,</HI> for assuming the Arms of <HI>England; Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> for designing the death of some Privy Counsellors; <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> for aspiring, by the match of the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> to the English Crown; <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> for dangerous machinati∣ons against the person of Queen <HI>Elizabeth; Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> for endea∣vouring to subject <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to the King's arbitrary Power: That the Historians, who barely report these Persons thus charged, are not bound to <HI>make the charge good</HI>; it is enough if they name their respective accusers, as here I have named the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>It is also observable, that some of the Persons aforesaid, though condemned and executed, have since found such favour (or justice rather) with unpartiall Posterity, that though they could not revive their persons, they have restored their memories to their innocence. And if the like shall be the hap of this Arch-bishop, I shall rejoyce therein; I mean, if the <HI>Animadvertor</HI>'s defence of him seems so clear, as to out-shine the evidence; so weighty, as to out-poize all al∣legations, which in printed Books are published against him.</P>
<P>In testimony whereof, I return nothing in contradiction to what the <HI>Anim∣advertor</HI> hath written; and it is questionable, whether my <HI>desire</HI> that he may, or <HI>distrust</HI> that he will not, be believed be the greater. Whatever the success be, I forbear farther rejoynder.</P>
<P>To fight with a shaddow, (whether one's own or another's) passeth for the proverbiall expression of a vain and useless act. But seeing the <HI>dead</HI> are some∣times tearmed <HI>shaddows, umbrae,</HI> to fall foul on them, without absolute necessity, is an act, not onely <HI>vain,</HI> but <HI>wicked</HI>; not onely <HI>useless,</HI> but <HI>uncharitable</HI>: And therefore no more hereof.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our Author proceedeth, 167. <HI>Thus none, seeing now foul weather in Scotland, could expect it fair Sun-Shine in England.</HI>] In this I am as little of our Author's Opinion, as in most things else. The <HI>Sun</HI> in <HI>England</HI> might have shined with a brighter Beam, if the Clouds which had been gathered together, and <HI>threatned such foule Weather in Scotland,</HI> had been dispersed and scattered by the Thunder of our <HI>English</HI> Ordnance. The opportunity was well given, and well taken also, had it not been unhappily lost in the Prosecution.</P>

<P>Grant the <HI>Thunder</HI> of <HI>our English Ordnance,</HI> had scattered the <HI>Scottish Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uds</HI>; yet, (by the confession of the Animadvertor) there must first be <HI>foul weather</HI> in England, before there could be such fair <HI>weather</HI> to follow it. The
<PB N="31" REF="114"/>
Skyes are alwayes dark and lowring, even whilst the Thunder is Engendering therein. Military preparations, (in order to a Conquest of the <HI>Scotts</HI>) must needs give our Nation great troubles, and (for the time) <HI>un-Sunshine</HI> Eng∣land, which is enough to secure my Expression from just exception.</P>

<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> were then <HI>weak,</HI> unprovided of all Necessaries, not above three thousand compleat Armes to be found amongst them: The <HI>English</HI> on the other side making a formidable appearance, gallantly Horst, compleaty Ar∣med, and intermingled with the Choisest of the Nobility, and Gentry, in all the Nation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much of the mind of the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> that there was a visible Dispa∣rity betwixt the two Armies, and the Ods in the eye of flesh, on the side of the <HI>English.</HI> They were <HI>Gallantly Horst</HI> indeed, whether in Reference to their <HI>Horses</HI> or <HI>Riders,</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> pleasantly said, <HI>It would make the Scots fight against them, were it but to get their brave Cloaths.</HI> Indeed the strength of the <HI>Scots</HI> con∣sisted in their Reputation to be strong, (reported here by such as Friended them) and the <HI>Scotch Lyon</HI> was not half so fierce, as he was painted unto us. On the other side, The greatest disadvantage to the <HI>English</HI> was their owne <HI>injurious Modesty,</HI> observed alwayes to over-prize strangers above themselves, being ig∣norant of their owne Strength and Valour in War, because they had been so long accustomed to Peace. In all this Paragraph the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> and the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> may go abrest in their Judgments; and to prevent Quarrells, the Animad∣vertor shall have the right Hand, that they do not justle one the other.</P>

<P>But all this is written by the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> like an <HI>Historian,</HI> but not like a <HI>Doctor in Divinity.</HI> This mindeth me of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cambden's Remains pag. 250.</NOTE> Passage of King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> who standing on the <HI>Cliffes</HI> about St. <HI>David</HI>'s in <HI>Wales,</HI> and there viewing <HI>Ire∣land, I with my Ships am able</HI> (saith he), <HI>to make a Bridge over it, if it be no further:</HI> Which speech of his being related to <HI>Murchard King</HI> of <HI>Lemster</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>; he demanded, if he added not to his speech [with the Grace of God]: When it was answered that he made no mention of God; <HI>Then,</HI> said he more cheer∣fully, <HI>I feare him the lesse, which trusteth more to Himselfe, then to the Help of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> tells us, that it had been the <HI>easiest thing in the world for the English to have broken the Scots Army,</HI> I must tell him; here was one thing <HI>in the world easier,</HI> namely the inserting of these words, <HI>by God's Ordinary blessing,</HI> or something to that purpose.

<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> had been utterly disabled from creating <HI>Trouble</HI> to their <HI>King, disturbances</HI> in their owne <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>destruction</HI> to <HI>England.</HI> So true is that of the wise <HI>Historian, Conatus subditorum irritos imperia semper promovêre</HI>; the <HI>Insur∣rections</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> when they are supprest, do alwayes make the <HI>King stron∣ger,</HI> and the <HI>Subjects weaker.</HI></P>

<P>All this proceeds (as the former) on the <HI>Supposition</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> had bea∣ten the <HI>Scots,</HI> which though (in the eye of flesh) probable, was uncertain. The <HI>Latines</HI> and <HI>English</HI> have the same word MOMENTUM, MOMENT, which signifieth, as <HI>Time</HI> of the <HI>least Continuance,</HI> so matters of <HI>most Concernment,</HI> to shew that the <HI>Scales</HI> of <HI>Successe,</HI> which <HI>God</HI> alone holds in his <HI>Hand,</HI> are so ticklish, that the MOTE of a MOMENT may turne them on either side, which is the reason, why no man can positively conclude of future Contingencies.</P>

<P>I can patiently comport with the <HI>Animadvertor's Ieers,</HI> which I behold as so many <HI>Frogs,</HI> that it is pretty and pleasing to see them hop and skip about, ha∣ving not much harm in them: but I cannot abide his <HI>Railings,</HI> which are like to <HI>Toads,</HI> swelling with <HI>venom</HI> within them. Any one may rail who is bred but in BILLINGS-GATE-COLLEDGE: and I am sorry to hear such language from the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> a <HI>Doctor</HI> in <HI>Divinity</HI>; seeing <HI>railing</HI> is as much beneath a <HI>Doctor,</HI> as against <HI>Divinity.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author thus proceedeth, fol. 168. <HI>Next day the Convocation came toge∣ther, &amp;c. when, contrary to the generall expectation, it was mentioned to improve the present opportunity, in perfecting the new Canons which they had begun.</HI>] I have not heard of any such motion, as our Author speaks of, from any who were pre∣sent at that time, though I have diligently laboured to inform my self in it: Nor is it probable, that any such motion should be made, as the case then stood. The Parliament had been dissolv'd on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 5th. of <HI>May</HI>; the Cler∣gy met in Convocation on the morrow after, expecting then to be dissolved, and licensed to go home again. But, <HI>contrary to that generall expectation,</HI> in stead of hearing some newes of his Majesties Writ for their dissolution, there came an Order from the Arch-bishop to the Prolocutor, to adjourn till <HI>Saturday.</HI> And this was all the businesse which was done that day; the Clergy generally being in no small amazment, when they were required not to <HI>dissolve,</HI> till fur∣ther Order. <HI>Saturday</HI> being come, what then? <HI>A new Commission,</HI> saith he, <HI>was brought from his Majesty, by vertue whereof</HI> WE <HI>were warranted still to sit, not in the capacity of a Convocation, but of a Synod.</HI> I had thought our Author, with his <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI> Friends, had better harkened to the tenour of that Commission, than to come out with such a gross and wild absurdity, as this is, so fit for none as Sir <HI>Edward Deering,</HI> and for him onely, to make sport withall in the House of Commons. At the beginning of the Convocation, when the Prolo∣cutor was admitted, the Arch-bishop produc'd his Majesties Commission un∣der the Great Seal; whereby the Clergy was enabled to consult, treat of, and conclude such Canons, as they conceiv'd most expedient to the peace of the Church, and his Majestie's service. But this Commission being to expire with the end of the Parliament, it became void, of no effect as soon as the Parlia∣ment was dissolved. Which being made known unto the King, who was re∣solv'd
<PB N="34" REF="116"/>
the Convocation should continue, and that the Clergy should go on in compleating those Canons, which they had so happily begun; He caus'd a new Commission to be sent unto them, in the same words, and to the very same effect, as the other was; but that it was to continue <HI>duran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e beneplacito</HI> onely, as the other was not.</P>

<P>The Reader may take notice, that there is some difference in judgment be∣twixt the Animadvertor and me; and no wonder then if some (no great, I hope) <HI>variations</HI> betwixt us, in relating the passages of this <HI>Convocation,</HI> each of us observing what made most for his own <HI>interest.</HI> The Reader also may be pleased to use his own discretion, and to credit him, whom he believeth most probable of the <HI>two,</HI> exactly to observe, firmly to remember, and faithfully to relate, what we saw done, (both of us being there) and since borrowing help of our <HI>friends,</HI> then present, where we fall short in our <HI>intelligence.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author goes on as followeth, <HI>Ibid. Dr.</HI> Brownrig, <HI>Dr.</HI> Hacket, <HI>Dr.</HI> Holdsworth, <HI>&amp;c. with others, to the number of thirty six, earnestly protested against the continuance of the Convocation.</HI>] It's possible enough that Dr. <HI>Brownrig,</HI> now Lord Bishop of <HI>Excester,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hacket,</HI> and the rest of the thirty six, our Author being of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> (in his own understanding of the word) might be unsatisfied in the continuance of the Convocation, because of some offence, which, as they conceiv'd, would be taken at it. But if they had <HI>protested,</HI> and protested earnest∣ly, as our Author tells us, the noise of so many Votes concurring, must needs be heard by all the rest which were then assembled; from none of which I can learn any thing of this <HI>protestation.</HI></P>

<P>I am nothing moved with his jeer, when he calleth me of the <HI>Quorum</HI> in this <HI>Convocation. Mithridates King</HI> of <HI>Pontus</HI> is commonly reported, so habited to the <HI>eating of poyson,</HI> that that which was <HI>nauseous</HI> and <HI>noxious</HI> at the first, by custom became <HI>harmless</HI> unto him. I am so used to the <HI>bitter jeers</HI> of the <HI>Anim∣advertor,</HI> so frequently <HI>laid</HI> in my <HI>dish,</HI> that now they are become <HI>food,</HI> not <HI>phy∣sick,</HI> unto me; and the greatest quantity of them will not so much as <HI>stir</HI> my <HI>constitution, to anger.</HI></P>
<P>It seemeth strange to me indeed, that the <HI>Protest</HI> of the <HI>Dissentors was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eard,</HI> by the rest in the <HI>Convocation</HI>; I cannot be so uncharitable, to think them in this point like those of whom the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">2 P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 3.5.</NOTE> <HI>Apostle</HI> speaketh, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>this they are willingly ignorant of:</HI> I impute it rather to their forgetful∣ness, most of them surviving being aged persons, and this done more then <HI>six∣teen years</HI> since. For though it be true, <HI>Omnia quae curant senes meminerunt</HI>; yet were they more prone to oblivion in this particular, because they <HI>cared not for</HI> that Protestation, they disliked; and therefore never charged it on their Me∣mories.</P>
<P>The best is, I may speak (I hope, as yet) of the <HI>thirty six Dissentors,</HI> in the same language of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15.6.</NOTE> <HI>Apostle, Of whom the greater part remain untill this present, but some are fallen asleep.</HI> Bishop <HI>Brownrig,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hacket,</HI> Dr. <HI>Warmester,</HI> &amp;c. are still (and may they long be) alive, who will be believed in this point, that they protested against the <HI>sitting</HI> of the <HI>Convocation,</HI> after the <HI>dissolution</HI> of the <HI>Par∣liament.</HI></P>

<P>Or if they did <HI>protes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> so <HI>earnestly,</HI> as he said they did, why was not the Pro∣testation reduc'd into writing, subscribed with their hands in due form of Law, and so delivered to the Register to remain upon Record (amongst the other Act of that House) for their Indemnity: Which not being done, ren∣dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> this Protest of theirs (if any such Protest there were) to signifie nothing, but their dislike of the continuance.</P>

<P>Herein the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> doth speak a <HI>sad truth</HI>; the Dissentors were ill ad∣vised herein, whereby their <HI>Protest</HI> (<HI>significant</HI> onely in their own consciences) was legally rendred of none effect.</P>
<P>But herein they may partly be excused, because they (though not entring a <HI>written Protest</HI>) supposed a <HI>verball one</HI> would <HI>manifest their dislike,</HI> and hoped it would sufficiently secure them from a danger, which (though suspected) was not certain to ensue.</P>
<P>This afterwards was very eagerly urged against them, by a <HI>Committee</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI>; and sorry I am, that they could not make their <HI>answer</HI> as clear as the <HI>objection.</HI></P>

<P>But whereas our Author tells us, that the whole House consisted but of <HI>six score persons,</HI> it may be thought that he diminisheth the number of set pur∣pose, to make his own party seem the greater. For in the lower House of Convocation for the Province of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> if all parties summon'd do ap∣pear, these are no fewer then two and twenty Deans, four and twenty Pre∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndaries, fifty four Archdeacons, and forty four Clerks, representing the Di∣oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>san Clergy, amounting in the totall to an hundred forty four persons; whereof the thirty six Protestors (if so many there were) make the fourth part onely. Howsoever, all parties being not well satisfied with the lawful∣ness of their continuance, his Majesty was advertis'd of it. Who, upon confe∣rence with his Judges and Counsell learned in the Laws, caus'd a short Wri∣ting to be drawn, and subscribed by their severall hands, in these following words, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>White-hall, May</HI> the 10th. 1640. the <HI>Convocation being called by the Kings Writ, is to continue till it be dissolved by the Kings Writ, notwithstanding the dissolving of the Parliament.</HI> Subscribed by <HI>Finch</HI> Lord Keeper, <HI>Manchester</HI> Lord Privy Seal, <HI>Littleton</HI> chief Justice of the Common Pleas, <HI>Banks</HI> Atturney Ge∣nerall, <HI>whit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield</HI> and <HI>Heath,</HI> his Majesties Serjeants.</P>

<P>Which Writing (an <HI>Instrument</HI> our Author calls it) being communicated to the Clergy by the Lord Arch-bishop on the morrow after, did so compose
<PB N="37" REF="117"/>
the minds of all men, that they went forwards very cheerfully with the work in hand. The principall of those whom our Author calls Dissenters, bringing in the Canon of <HI>Preaching for conformity,</HI> (being the eighth Canon in the Book, as now they are plac'd) which was received and allowed of, as it came from his hand without alteration.</P>

<P>And calleth it an <HI>Instrument</HI> properly enough, both to the originall notation, and modern acception of the word. <HI>Instrument</HI> is so termed <HI>ab instruendo,</HI> from <HI>Instructing.</HI> This Writing did first instruct Us at the present, that, by the judg∣ment of those great States-men and Lawyers, We might legally continue, notwithstanding the dissolution of the Parliament. And since, this Writing hath (by the event thereof) <HI>instructed</HI> us, that seeing the judgments of the <HI>Grandees</HI> in the Law were censured erroneous in Parliament, it is unsafe in matters of this nature, to rely on the opinions of any [comparatively] private persons.</P>
<P>As for the modern acception of the word, I appeal to the Criticks in Language, whether this <HI>Writing</HI> (as the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> is fain to term it) of the Judges, may not be called by the generall name of <HI>Instrument,</HI> harmoniously enough to the propriety thereof.</P>

<P>Howsoever, our Author keeps himself to his former folly, shutting up his extravagancy with this conclusion, fol. 169. <HI>Thus was an old Convocation con∣verted into a new Synod.</HI>] An expression borrowed from the speech of a <HI>witty Gentleman,</HI> as he is called by the Author of the <HI>History of the Reign of King Charls,</HI> and since by him declar'd to be the Lord <HI>George Digby,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Bristow.</HI> But he that spent most of his wit upon it, and thereby gave occasion unto others for the like mistakings, was Sir <HI>Edward Deering,</HI> in a speech made against these Canons, <HI>Anno</HI> 1640. where we find these flourishes:
<Q>Would you confute the <HI>Convocation</HI>? They were a <HI>holy Synod.</HI> Would you argue a∣gainst the <HI>Synod</HI>? Why, they were <HI>Commissioners.</HI> Would you dispute the <HI>Commission</HI>? They will mingle all powers together, and answer, that they were some fourth thing, that neither we know nor imagine; that is to say, (as it followes afterwards, <HI>pag.</HI> 27.) a <HI>Convocationall-Synodicall-Assembly</HI> of <HI>Commissioners.</HI></Q>
More of this fine stuff we may see hereafter. In the mean time we may judge, by this remnant, of the whole Piece; and find it upon proof to be very sleight, and not worth the wearing. For first, the Gentleman could not, and our Author cannot chuse but know, that a <HI>Convocation</HI> and a <HI>Synod</HI> (as us'd in <HI>England</HI> of late times) are but the same one thing under divers names, the one borrowed from a <HI>Grecian,</HI> the other from a <HI>Latin</HI> Originall. The Con∣vocation of the Clergy of the Province of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> being nothing but a <HI>Pro∣vinciall Synod</HI>; as a <HI>Nationall Synod</HI> is nothing else, but the Convocation of the Clergy of both Provinces. Secondly, our Author knowes by this time, that the <HI>Commission</HI> which seems to makes this doughty difference, changed not the <HI>Convocation</HI> into a <HI>Synod,</HI> (as some vainly think) but onely made that Convo∣cation active in order to the making of Canons, which otherwise had been a∣ble to proceed no further then the grant of <HI>Subsidies.</HI> Thirdly, that nothing is more ordinary, then for the <HI>Convocations</HI> of all times since the <HI>Reformation,</HI> to take unto themselves the name of <HI>Synods.</HI> For, the Articles of Religion made in the Convocation <HI>Anno</HI> 1552. are called in the Title of the Book, <HI>Articuli de quibus in Synodo Londinensi convenit, &amp;c.</HI> The same name given to those agreed on in the Convocation, <HI>Anno</HI> 1562. as appears by the Title of that Book also, in the <HI>Latin</HI> Edition. The Canons of the year 1571. are said to be concluded and agreed upon <HI>in Synodo inchoatâ Lond. in aede Divi Pauli, &amp;c.</HI> In the year 1575. came out a Book of Articles, with this Title following, <HI>viz. Articles whereupon it was agreed by the most reverend father in God, the Arch-bishop of</HI> Can∣terbury,
<PB N="38" REF="118"/>
<HI>and other the Bishops, and the whole Clergy in the Province of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>in the Convocation or synod holden at</HI> Westminster. The like we find in the year 1597. (being the last active Convocation in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time) in which we meet with a Book entituled, <HI>Constitutiones Ecclesiasticae, &amp;c. in Synodo incho∣atâ Londini vicesimo quinto die mensis Octobris.</HI></P>

<P>I request the Reader would be pleased, to call to his <HI>remembrance a passage of the Animadvertors,</HI> on my fifth Book, relating to the Reigne of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth.
<Q>I must confess my self to be at a loss in this intricate Labyrinth, unless per∣haps there were some criticall difference between a SYNOD and a CONVOCATI∣ON; the first being called by the Arch-bishops, in their severall and respective Provinces, as the necessities of the Church; the other onely by the King, as his oc∣casions and affairs, did require the same.</Q></P>
<P>I find my self now in the <HI>like labyrinth,</HI> and can meet with no <HI>Ariadne</HI>'s <HI>thread,</HI> to extricate my self. I confess; <HI>commonly, CONVOCATION</HI> and <HI>SYNOD</HI> pass for <HI>Synonyma's,</HI> signifying one and the same thing; yet some make this nice difference.

<P>I acknowledge my self a <HI>Seeker</HI> in this point, and will not wilfully bolt mine eyes against the beams of Truth, by whomsoever delivered: Mean time, I crave leave to enter this my dissatisfaction herein, seeing the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> so lately did confess his, in a thing of the like nature.</P>

<P>Our Author finally is to know, that though the members of the two Con∣vocations of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Canterbury</HI> did not meet in person, yet they communi∣cated their counsells, the results of the one being dispatcht unto the other, and there agreed on, or rejected, as they saw cause for it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>am not to know it,</HI> for I <HI>knew it before,</HI> and nothing in my Book appears to the contrary; that the two <HI>Provinciall Synods privately</HI> did communicate their <HI>trans∣actions,</HI> as they were <HI>in fieri, in the making</HI>; and at last, <HI>publickly, viz.</HI> when We at <HI>Westminster</HI> had compleated the <HI>Canons,</HI> by Our subscription thereunto.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Which laid together, shewes the vanity of another passage in the Speech of Sir <HI>Edward Deering,</HI> where he vapoureth thus, <HI>viz.</HI> A strange <HI>Commission,</HI> wherein no one <HI>Commissioner's</HI> name is to be found; a strange <HI>Convocation,</HI> that lived when the Parliament was dead; a strange <HI>holy Synod,</HI> where one part never saw, ne∣ver conferred with the other. Lastly, Sir <HI>Edward Deering</HI> seems to marvell at the Title of the Book of Canons then in question, expressing, <HI>that they were trea∣ted upon in Convocation, agreed upon in Synod. And this,</HI> saith he, <HI>is a new Mould to cast Canons in, never us'd before.</HI> But had he looked upon the Title of the Book of Canons, <HI>Anno</HI> 1603. he had found it otherwise. The Title this, <HI>viz. Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiasticall,</HI> treated <HI>by the Bishop of</HI> London, <HI>Pre∣sident of the Convocation for the Province of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a∣greed upon <HI>with the Kings Majesty's licence in their</HI> Synod <HI>begun at</HI> London, <HI>Anno</HI> 1603. And so much for the satisfaction of all such persons, whom either that Gentleman, or this our Author, have mis-informed, and consequently abused in this particular.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, Ibid. <HI>Now because great Bodies move slowly, &amp;c. it was thought fit to contract the Synod into a select Committee of some twenty six, beside the Prolocutor.</HI>] No such contracting of the Synod as our Author speaks of. There was indeed a Committee of twenty six, or thereabouts, appointed to consider of a Canon for uniformity in <HI>some Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> of which number were the principall of those whom he calls Dissenters, and our <HI>Au∣thor</HI> too amongst the rest; who having agreed upon the Canon, it was by them presented to the rest of the Clergy in Convocation, and by them approv'd. And possible it is, that the drawing up o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some other Canons might be referr'd also to that Committee, (as is accustomed in such cases) without contracting the whole House into that small body, or excluding any man from being present at their Consultation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what offence the word <HI>contracting</HI> may give, but my meaning, obvious to any Reader, is this, that a select Committee was appointed, to pre∣pare matters of greatest importance. No member being excluded from being <HI>present at,</HI> but from <HI>giving a Vote in,</HI> that Consultation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But whereas our Author afterwards tells us, that <HI>nothing should be accounted the Act of the House till thrice</HI> (as he takes it) <HI>publickly voted therein.</HI>] It is but as <HI>he takes it,</HI> or <HI>mistakes</HI> it rather, and so let it go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>He might have allowed me the liberty of that modest Parenthesis, without carping at it. Some things I confesse (having since better informed my self) passed at the first time; but others which were meerly <HI>new</HI> were <HI>Thrice read,</HI> on the same token that it occasioned the contest betwixt the Prolocutor and Doctor <HI>Holdsworth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But I needed not to have signified, that our Author was one of the Com∣mittee, he will tell it himself; and he will tell us more then that, publishing himself for one of the thirty six <HI>Dissenters,</HI> the better to ingratiate himself with the rising side. <HI>The next day</HI> (so he lets us knovv) <HI>We all subscribed the Canons, suffering our selves (according to the order of such Meetings) to be all concluded by the majority of Votes, though</HI> some of US <HI>in the Committee</HI> privately dissented <HI>in the passing of many particulars.</HI>] So then, our Author was content to play the good∣fellow at the last, and go along hand in hand with the rest of his company; <HI>dis∣senting privately,</HI> but consenting publickly, which is as much as can be looked for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not worth the while for him who is <HI>falling</HI> into the grave to endeavour to ingratiate himselfe with any <HI>rising-side.</HI> I appeal to the Animadvertor's own Conscience, if I have not written the plaine truth herein.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, Ibid. <HI>No sooner came these Canons abroad into a publick view, but various were mens censures upon them.</HI>] Not possible that in such a con∣fusion, both of affections and opinions, it should otherwise be. <HI>Non omnibus

una voluntas,</HI> was a note of old, and will hold true as long as there are <HI>many men</HI> to have <HI>many minds.</HI> And yet, if my information deceive me not, these Ca∣nons found great approbation from the mouths of some, from whom it had been least expected; particularly from Justice <HI>Crook,</HI> whose <HI>Argument</HI> in the case of <HI>Ship-mony,</HI> was printed afterwards by the Order of the House of Com∣mons. Of whom I have been told, by a person of great worth and credit, that having read over the Book of Canons, when it first came out, he lifted up his hands, and gave hearty thanks to Almighty God, that he had liv'd to see such good effects of a Convocation. It was very well that they pleased him; but that they should please all men was not to be hoped for.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our Author proceeds, fol. 171. <HI>Many took exception at the hollowness of the Oath in the middle thereof, having its bowels puffed up with a windy &amp;c. a</HI> cheveral <HI>word, which might be stretched as men would measure it.</HI>] Of this <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has made so much noise in the world, I shall now say nothing. Somewhat is here subjoyn'd by our Author in excuse thereof, the rest made up by the <HI>Observator.</HI> Onely I shall make bold to ask him, why he observ'd not this <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when the Oath was first under consideration? or why he signified not his <HI>dissent</HI> when it came to the Vote, and shewed some reasons which might move him to object against it? It had been fitter for a <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>juditious</HI> man to signifie his dislike of any thing when it might be mended, then to joyne with others in condemning it, when it was past remedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not sensible of any just cause of exception therein. The Animadvertor confesseth that I have subjoyned <HI>some what</HI> in the excuse thereof. And set me add that that <HI>somewhat</HI> is as much to purpose in the defence of that Oath (being borrowed from as learned and <HI>pious</HI> a pen, as <HI>England</HI> then enjoyed) as any thing, that the Animadvertor or his party can alledge. Wherefore except, <HI>joyning with those who do defend it,</HI> be the same with, <HI>joyning with those who do con∣demne it,</HI> the Animadvertor hath unjustly ranked me amongst the latter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Mala mens, malus animus,</HI> as the saying is. The Convocation had no ill intent in it when they passed it so, though some few, out of their perversness and corrupt effections, were willing to put their own sense on it, and spoil an hones<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meaning Text with a factious Gloss. But let us follow our Author as he leads the way, and we shall find, that</P>
<P>Ibid. <HI>Some Bishops were very forward in pressing this Oath, even before the time thereof. For, whereas a liberty was allowed to all to deliberate thereon, untill the Feast of</HI> Michael <HI>the Arch-angel, some presently pressed the Ministers of their Diocesses for the taking thereof.</HI>] It seems by this, that our Author was so far from taking no∣tice of any thing done in the Convocation, when the Canon for the Oath was framed, that he never so much as looked into the Canon it self, since the Book came out. He had not else dreamt of a liberty of Deliberation, till the Feast of St. <HI>Michael</HI> the <HI>Arch-angel,</HI> which I am sure the Canon gives not. The <HI>Sy∣nod</HI> did indeed decree, that <HI>all Arch-bishops and Bishops, and all other Priests and Deacons, in places exempt or not exempt, should, before the second day of</HI> November <HI>next ensuing, take the following Oath, against all innovation of Doctrine or Discipline.</HI> By which we see, that the Oath was to be given and taken before the second of <HI>November,</HI> but no such thing as <HI>Liberty of Deliberation till the Feast of St. Mi∣chael.</HI> And therefore if some Bishops did press the Clergy of their severall and
<PB N="41" REF="119"/>
respective Diocesses, as soon as they returned home from the Convocation; they might well do it by the Canon, without making any such <HI>essay of their activity, if providence</HI> (as our Author most <HI>wisely</HI> words it) had not prevented them▪</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though there was no Solemn Order entered, or printed; yet am I sure, (ha∣ving cause to be assured thereof) such a condescention was agreed on, and I know who did plead the Benefit of such <HI>Deliberation,</HI> on the same token it was denied it him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If any of the Bishops did require their Clergy to take the Oath upon their knees, (as he saies they did) though it be more then was directed by the Canon; yet I conceive, that no wise man would scruple at it, considering the gravity and greatness of the business which he was about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Oath of <HI>Allegiance</HI> and <HI>Supremacy,</HI> being of as high and holy a nature and concernment, are never urged in that posture. All things are disposed of by divine <HI>Providence</HI>; and let the Doctor write against me, what he pleaseth; but take heed how he writes corrective <HI>Animadversions</HI> on the proceedings of the <HI>Greatest</HI> and Best of Beeings.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But then, Ibid. <HI>The Exception of Exceptions was, because they were generally condemned as illegally passed, to the prejudice of the fundamentall liberty of the Sub∣ject, whereof we shall hear enough in the next Parliament.</HI>] Not <HI>generally condemned,</HI> either as <HI>illegally passed,</HI> or as tending to <HI>prejudice</HI> of the Subjects Rights, I am sure of that. Scarse so much as condemned by any for those respects, but by such whom it concern'd, (for carrying on of their De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignes) to weaken the au∣thority of the Church, and advance their own. But because our Author tells us, that we shall find enough of this in the following Parliament, we are to follow him to that Parliament for our satisfaction: And there we find, that Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> made a Speech in the Committee of Lords against the Canons, made by the Bishops in the last Convocation, in which he <HI>endeavoured to prove,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P><HI>Diogenes</HI> being demanded what one should give him to strike on the head as hard as he could, <HI>Give me,</HI> (sayed he) but an <HI>Helmet.</HI> Well fare my <HI>Helmet,</HI> the seasonable interposition of the word ENDEAVOURED! which hath secu∣red me from the blowes of the Animadvertor, and perchance his hand thereby retunded. Besides I have a double <HI>Helmet,</HI> Master [now <HI>Serjeant</HI>] <HI>Mainard,</HI> no lesse eminently known for his skill in <HI>Law,</HI> than for his love to the Clergy, by pleading so effectually (in his <HI>success</HI> as well as <HI>desire</HI>) for their Tithes. Where∣fore being weary with this long contest, I resolve for a while even to take my <HI>na∣turall rest,</HI> and will quietly sleep, untill <HI>Iogged</HI> by that, which particularly concerneth me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Endeavoured to prove,</HI> that the Clergy had no power to make Canons, with∣out common consent in Parliament, because <HI>in the</HI> Saxon's <HI>times, Lawes and Constitutions Ecclesiasticall had the confirmation of Peers, and sometimes of the People; to which great Councills our Parliaments do succeed.</HI>] Which Argument, if it be of force to prove, that the Clergy can make no Canons, without consent of the Peers and People in Parliament; it must prove also, that the Peers and People can make no <HI>Statutes</HI> without consent of the Clergy in their Convocation. My reason is, Because such Councels in the times of the <HI>Saxons</HI> were mixt As∣semblies, consisting as well of Laicks as of Ecclesiasticks; and the matters there concluded on of a mixt nature also, Laws being passed as commonly in
<PB N="42" REF="120"/>
them in order to the good governance of the Common-wealth, as Canons for the regulating such things as concern'd Religion. But these great Coun∣cels of the <HI>Saxons</HI> being divided into two parts in the times ensuing, the Clergy did their work by themselves, without any confirmation from the King or Parliament, till the submission of the Clergy to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth. And if the Parliaments did succeed in the place of those great Councells, (as he saies they did) it was, because that antiently the Procurators of the Clergy, not the Bishops onely, had their place in Parliament, though neither <HI>Peers</HI> nor <HI>People</HI> voted in the Convocations. Which being so, it is not much to be admi∣red, <HI>that there was some checking</HI> (as is said in the second Argument) <HI>about the dis∣use of the generall making of such Church-Laws.</HI> But <HI>checking</HI> or repining at the proceeding of any Superiour Court, makes not the Acts thereof illegall; for, if it did, the Acts of Parliaments themselves would be reputed of no force, or illegally made, because the Clergy for a long time have <HI>checkt</HI> (and think they have good cause to check) for their being excluded. Which <HI>checking</HI> of the Commons appears not onely in those antient Authors which the Gentle∣man cited, but in the Remonstrance tendred by them to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, exemplified at large in these Animadversions, <HI>lib.</HI> 3. <HI>n.</HI> 61. But because this, being a Record of the Convocation, may not come within the walk of a Com∣mon Lawyer, I shall put him in mind of that memorable passage in the Parlia∣ment, 51 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3d. which in brief was this: The Commons finding themselves aggrieved, as well with certain Constitutions made by the Clergy in their Synods, as with some Laws or Ordinances which were lately passed, more to the advantage of the Clergy then the Common People, put in a Bill to this effect, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That no Act nor Ordinance should from thenceforth be made or granted on the Petition of the said Clergy, without the consent of the Com∣mons; and that the said Commons should not be bound in times to come by any Constitutions made by the Clergy of this Realm, for their own advan∣tage, to which the Commons of this Realm had not given consent.</Q>
The rea∣son of which is this, (and 'tis worth the marking)
<Q><HI>Car eux ne veulent estre ob∣ligez a nul de vos Estatuz ne Ordinances faitz sanz leur Assent.</HI> Because the said Clergy did not think themselves bound (as indeed they were not in those times) by any Statute, Act, or Ordinance, made without their assent in the Court of Parliament.</Q>
But that which could not be obtain'd by this <HI>checking</HI> of the Commons, in the declining and last times of King <HI>Edward</HI> 3. was in some part effected by the more vigorous prosecution of King <HI>Henry</HI> 8. who, to satisfie the desires of the Commons in this particular, and repress their checkings, obtained from the Clergy, that they should neither make nor execute any Canons, without his consent, as before is said; so that the Kings power of confirming Canons was grounded on the free and voluntary submission of the Clergy, and was not built, as the third Argument objecteth, on so weak a foundation as <HI>the Pope's making Canons by his sole power</HI>: the Pope not making Canons here, nor putting his Prescripts and Letters decretory in the place of Canons, but onely as a remedy for some present exigency. So that the King's power in this particular not being built upon the Popes, as he said it was, it may well stand, <HI>That Kings may make Canons without consent of Parliament,</HI> though he saith they cannot. But whereas it is argued, in the fourth place, that the clause in the Statute of Submission, in which it is said, that <HI>the Clergy shall not make Canons without the Kings leave,</HI> doth not imply, that by His leave alone they may make them; I cannot think that he delivered this for Law, and much less for Logick. For, had this been looked on formerly as a piece of Law, the Parliaments would have <HI>check'd</HI> at it at some time or other, and been as sensible of the Kings enchroachments, in executing this power without them, as antiently some of them had been about the <HI>disuse</HI> of the like generall consent in the making of them.</P>

<P><HI>Fol.</HI> 180. In the next place our Author tells us, that Mr. <HI>Maynard endeavou∣red also to prove, that these Canons were against the King's</HI> Prerogative, <HI>the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of the Subject.</HI>] And he saith well, that it was endeavou∣red to be proved, and endeavoured onely, nothing, amounting to a proof, be∣ing to be found in that which followes. It had before been Voted by the House of Commons, that the <HI>Canons are against fundamentall Laws of this Realm, against the Kings Prerogative, Property of the Subject, the Right of Parliament, and do tend to faction and sedition.</HI> And it was fit that some <HI>endeavours</HI> should be used to make good the <HI>Vote.</HI> But, this being but a generall charge, requires a generall answer onely, and it shall be this: Before the Canons were subscribed, they were imparted to the King by the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and by the King communicated to the Lords of the Councill; who calling to them the assistance of the Judges, and some of the Kings Councill learned in the Laws of this Realm, caus'd the said Canons to be read and considered of, the King being then present. By all which, upon due and mature deliberation, the Canons were approv'd; and being so approv'd, were sent back to the Clergy in the Convocation, and by them subscribed. And certainly it had been strange, that they should pass the approbation of the Judges and learned Lawyers, had they contained any thing <HI>against the fundamentall Laws of the Land, the Property of the Subject, and the Rights of Parliament,</HI> or been approv'd of by the Lords of his Majesties Councill, had any thing been contained in them derogatory to the Kings <HI>Prerogative,</HI> or <HI>tending to faction and sedition.</HI> So that the foundation being ill laid, the superstructures and objections which are built upon it, may be easily shaken and thrown down. To the first therefore it is ansvvered, that no∣thing hath been more ordinary in all former times, than for the Canons of the Church to inflict <HI>penalties</HI> on such, as shall <HI>disobey them</HI>; exemplified in the late Canons of 1603. many of which extend not onely unto Excommunica∣tion, but even to <HI>Degradation</HI> and <HI>Irregularity,</HI> for which, see <HI>Can.</HI> 38.113. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To the second▪ that there is nothing in those Canons which <HI>determine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> or <HI>li∣miteth</HI> the Kings Authority, but much that makes for, and defendeth the Right of the Subject, for which the Convocation might rather have expected thanks then censure, from ensuing Parliaments. To the third, That when the Canon did declare the Government of Kings to be founded on the Law of Nature, it was not to condemn all other Governments, as being unlawfull, but to com∣mend that of the Kings as being the best. Nor can it Logically be inferr'd, that because the Kingly Government is not receiv'd in all places, that there∣fore it ought not so to be: or that the Government (by this Canon) should be the same in all <HI>places,</HI> and in all <HI>alike</HI>; because some Kings do, and may law∣fully part with many of their Rights for the good of their Subjects, which others do, and may as lawfully retain unto themselves. To the fourth, That the Doctrine of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> is built expresly on the words of St. <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 13. <HI>v.</HI> 2. and therefore to condemn the Canon in that behalf, is to condemn the Word of God upon vvhich it is founded. Finally, to the fifth and last, That the Statute of 5, 6 <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. declaring, that the daies there mentioned shall be kept for <HI>Holy-daies,</HI> and no other, relates onely to the abolishing of some other Festivalls, which had been formerly observ'd in the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> and not to the disabling of the Church from ordaining any other Holy-dayes, (on emergent causes) in the times to come.</P>

<P>The power of Convocation being thus shaken and endangered, that of the High Commission and the Bishops Courts was not like to hold; the one being taken away by Act of Parliament, and the other much weakned in the coercive power thereof, by a clause in that Act, of which our Author tell us, that</P>
<P>Fol. 182. Mr. Pim <HI>triumphed at this successe, crying out</HI> digitus Dei, <HI>it is the finger of God, that the Bishops should so supinely suffer themselves to be surprised in their power.</HI>] And well might Mr. <HI>Pim</HI> triumph, as having gain'd the point he aim'd at, in subverting the <HI>coercive power,</HI> and consequently the whole exercise of Ec∣clesiastical Jurisdiction. But he had no reason to impute it to the <HI>finger of God,</HI> or to the carelesnesse of the Bishops in suffering themselves to be so supinely surpris'd. For first the Bishops saw too plainly, that those general words by which they were disabled from inflicting any <HI>pain</HI> or <HI>penalty,</HI> would be exten∣ded to Suspension, Excommunication, and other Ecclesiastical censures. But secondly, they saw withall that the stream was too strong for them to strive against, most of the Lords being wrought on by the popular party in the House of Commons, to passe the Bill. Thirdly, they were not without hope, that when the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was disbanded, and that Nation satisfied, by the Kings condescensions to them, there might be such an explication made of those ge∣neral words, as to restrain them unto temporal <HI>pains</HI> and civill penalties, by which the censures of the Church might remain as formerly. And fourthly, in order thereunto they had procured a <HI>Proviso</HI> to be entred in the House of
<PB N="45" REF="121"/>
Peers, <HI>That the general words in this Bill should extend onely to the High Commission Court, and not reach other Ecclesiastical jurisdiction,</HI> for which consult our Author, <HI>fol.</HI> 181.

<P>Fol. 174. Dr. Pocklinton, <HI>and</HI> Dr. Bray, <HI>were the two first that felt the displea∣sures of it, the former for preaching and printing, the latter for licensing two Books, one called</HI> Sunday no Sabbath, <HI>the other the</HI> Christian Altar.] No other way to paci∣fie the high displeasures of the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> but by such a Sacrifice, who therefore is intrusted to gather such Propositions out of those two Books as were to be recanted by the one, and for which the other was to be depriv'd of all his preferments. And in this the Bishop serv'd his own turn, and the peo∣ples too: his own turn first, in the great controversie of the Altar, in which he was so great a stickler, and in which <HI>Pocklington</HI> was thought to have provoked him to take that revenge. The Peoples turn he serv'd next, in the condemning and recanting of some points about the Sabbath, though therein he ran cross to his former practice. Who had been not long since so far from those Sabbata∣rian rigors, (which now he would fain be thought to countenance) that he caus'd a Comedy to be acted before him at his house at <HI>Budgen,</HI> not onely on a Sunday in the afternoon, but upon such a Sunday also on which he had pub∣lickly given sacred Orders both to Priests and Deacons.

<P>Our Author proceeds, Fol. 182. <HI>A Bill (saith our Author) was sent up by the Commons against Mathew Wren Bishop of Ely, containing</HI> 25 <HI>Articles, &amp;c.</HI>] That such a Bill was sent up from the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> is undoubtedly true. And no lesse true it is, that many <HI>Impeachments</HI> of like nature were hammered, at, and about, the same time against many other <HI>Clergy men</HI> of good note, though inferiour Order; the <HI>Articles</HI> whereof were Printed and exposed to open saile to their great <HI>disparagement.</HI> And therefore I would faine know the Reason, why <HI>this Man</HI> should be <HI>singled out</HI> amongst all the rest to stand <HI>impeached</HI> upon <HI>record</HI> in our <HI>Author</HI>'s <HI>History</HI>; especially considering that there was nothing done by the <HI>Lords</HI> in pursuance of it, the <HI>Impeachment</HI> dying in a manner as soon as born.

Cosins</HI>; and one <HI>Bishop, Matthew Wren,</HI> conceiving <HI>these</HI> a suf∣ficient Representation of <HI>all the rest.</HI> Wherefore I cannot see how the <HI>Animad∣vertor</HI> can properly say, that <HI>Bishop Wren</HI> was by me <HI>singled out,</HI> except a QUATERNION be a <HI>single Man.</HI> It was not because his Charge was better (which for ought I know was not at all) proved, but for these Reasons:

<ITEM>1. He was one of the first in Time. Clamoured against.</ITEM>

<P>The occasion of it was a Speech made by the King in the House of Peers in favour of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> upon the Saturday before; which mov'd them to unite themselves by this Protestation for <HI>bringing to condign punishment, all such as shall either by force, practice, plots, counsels, conspiracies, or otherwise do any thing to the contrary of any thing in the same Protestation contain'd.</HI> Which Protestation being carried into the House of Peers, was after some few dayes generally taken by that House also. But the prevalent party in the House of Commons, having further aims then such as our Author pleaseth to take notice of, first caus'd it to be printed by an Or∣der of the fifth of <HI>May,</HI> that they might be sent down to the <HI>Sheriffes and Iustices of Peace in the severall Shires</HI>; to whom they intimated, <HI>that as they justified th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taking of it in themselves, so they could not but approve it in all such as should take it.</HI> But finding that this did not much edifie with the Country people, they de∣sired the Lords to concur with them in imposing the same. Failing whereof, by an Order of their own House onely, <HI>Iuly</HI> 30. it was declared, that <HI>the Pro∣testation made by them was fit to be taken by every Person that was well affected in Re∣ligion, and to the good of the Common-wealth; and therefore what Person soever did not take the same, was unfit to bear Office in the Church or Common-wealth.</HI> Which notwithstanding, many refus'd to take it, as our Author telleth us, not knowing but that some sinister use might be made thereof: as afterward appeared by those <HI>Pikes</HI> and <HI>Protestations,</HI> which conducted some of the five Members to the House of Commons.</P>

<P>From the first part of which calumny, the Bishops freed themselves well enough, as appears by our Author.

<P>And if he calls them formerly by the name of <HI>Royalists</HI> and <HI>High-Royalists,</HI> as he sometimes doth; it was not because he thought them worthy of no worse a Title, but because the name of <HI>Malignant</HI> had not then been born.</P>

<P>Not so. For then since the <HI>Name</HI> MALIGNANT was <HI>born,</HI> I would have used it on them, which I do not: Those words of the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> [<HI>worthy of no</HI> WORSE a TITLE] intimate, as if ROYALIST and HIGH-ROYALIST were BAD TITLES, which if not <HI>Honourable</HI> must be <HI>Inoffensive.</HI> If ROYAL the <HI>Primitive</HI> be GOOD, [a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 2.8.</NOTE> ROYAL Law, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 2 9.</NOTE> a ROYAL <HI>Priest-hood</HI>] ROYALIST the <HI>Derivative</HI> cannot be BAD, much lesse HIGH-ROYALIST, except <HI>Height</HI> makes that BAD being added thereunto, which was GOOD before.</P>

<P>He cannot chuse but know, that the name of <HI>Round-head</HI> was <HI>born</HI> at the same time also, and that it was as common in the Kings Party to call the Par∣liamentarians by the name of <HI>Round-heads,</HI> as it was with those of the Parlia∣ment Party, to call the King's adherents by the name of <HI>Malignants.</HI> And yet I do confidently say, that the word <HI>Round-head,</HI> as it was <HI>fixed as a note of dis∣grace</HI> on the Parliament party, doth not <HI>occur,</HI> on any occasion whatsoever, in our Authors History.

<P>I confesse the name ROUND-HEAD at the same time <HI>Trundled about</HI> in the Mouths of many men; but I conceived it beneath an <HI>Historian</HI> to make use thereof, because his <HI>Majesty</HI> in all his <HI>Proclamations, Declarations,</HI> and other <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> never made mention thereof, whilst MALIGNANT was often used in <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, Fol. 196. <HI>By this time ten of the eleven Bishops formerly subscribing their Protestation to the Parliament, were after some months durance (upon good Baile given) released, &amp;c.</HI>] Of the releasing of these Bishops we have spoke already. We are now onely to observe such mistakes and errors as relate un∣to it. And first they were not released at or about the time which our Author speaks of, that is to say, after such time as the word <HI>plunder</HI> had begun to be us'd amongst us. Plunder both <HI>name and thing,</HI> vvas unknovvn in <HI>England,</HI> till the beginning of the War; and the War began not, till <HI>September, An.</HI> 1642. which vvas some months after the releasing of the Bishops.</P>

<P>Secondly, he telleth us, that ten of the eleven which had subscribed, were released, whereas there were twelve which had subscrib'd as appears <HI>fol.</HI> 187. whereof ten were sent unto the Tower, and the other two committed to the custody of the Black-Rod, <HI>fol.</HI> 188. And if ten onely were releast, the other two must be kept in custody for a longer time: whereas we find the Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> at home in his Diocess, and the Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> at liberty in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>; they being the two whom he makes so far favour'd by the Parliament, as they scap't the Tower.</P>

<P>Thirdly, he telleth us, that, when all others were releast, Bishop <HI>Wren was still detain'd in the Tower,</HI> which is nothing so. That Bishop was releast upon Bail, when the other were returned unto his Diocesse, as the others did, and there continued for a time; when of a suddain he was snatched from his House at <HI>Downham,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> carried to the Tower, and there imprisoned; ne∣ver being brought unto a Hearing, nor any cause shewed for his imprisonment to this very day.</P>

<P>Fourthly, Archbishop <HI>Williams</HI> after his restoring unto liberty <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent not into the Kings Quarters,</HI> as our Author saith, but unto one of his own houses in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> where he continued till the year 1643. and then came to <HI>Oxford</HI>: not that he found the North too cold for him, or the War too hot; but to solicit for re∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wing of his <HI>Commendam</HI> in the Deanry of <HI>Westminster</HI>; the time for which he was to hold it drawing towards an end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing false or faulty. The <HI>Arch-bishop of York,</HI> stayed some weeks after his enlargement at <HI>Westminster,</HI> thence he went privately to the house of Sir <HI>Thomas Hedley</HI> in <HI>Huntingon shire,</HI> and thence to his Palace at <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood</HI> nigh <HI>York,</HI> where he gave the King a magnificent Intertainment.</P>
<P>King James setled the <HI>Deanry of Westminster</HI> under the great Seal on <HI>Dr. Wil∣liams,</HI> so long as he should continue Bishop of Lincoln. <HI>Hinc illa Lacrimae,</HI> hence the great <HI>heaving</HI> and <HI>hussing</HI> at Him, because He would not resigne it, which was so signal a Monument of his Master's favour unto him.</P>
<P>Being Arch-bishop of <HI>York,</HI> King <HI>Charls</HI> confirmed his <HI>Deanry</HI> unto him for
<PB N="52" REF="125"/>
three years, in lieu of the profits of his Arch-bishoprick, which the King had taken <HI>Sede vacante.</HI> So that it is probable enough, the renuing that Tearm might be a Joynt-Motive of his going to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>But I see nothing which I have written can be cavilled at, except because I call <HI>Yorkshire</HI> the King's <HI>Quarters,</HI> which <HI>as yet</HI> was the Kings WHOLE, when the Arch-bishop first came thither, (as being a little before the War be∣gan) though few Weeks after, it became the King's <HI>Quarters.</HI> Such a Prolepsis is familiar with the best Historians; and, in effect, is little more, then when the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Animadversi∣ons, pag. 205.</NOTE> Animadvertor calleth the <HI>Gag</HI> and <HI>Appello Caesarem,</HI> the Books of <HI>Bishop Montague</HI>; who, when they were written by him, was no (though soon after a) <HI>Bishop.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, fol. 196. <HI>Some of the</HI> aged Bishops <HI>had their</HI> tongues <HI>so used to the</HI> language <HI>of a</HI> third Estate, <HI>that more then once they ran on that</HI> (reputed) Rock <HI>in their speeches, for which they were publickly</HI> shent, <HI>and enjoyned an</HI> acknow∣ledgment <HI>of their mistake.</HI>] By whom they were so <HI>publickly shent,</HI> and who they were that so ingenuously <HI>acknowledged their mistake,</HI> as my Author telleth us not, so neither can I say whether it be true or false.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you again, It is true. The Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> and the Lord <HI>Say</HI> were two of the Lords (though this be more then I need discover) who checked them. And of two of those Bishops, Dr. <HI>Hall,</HI> late Bishop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> is gone to God, and the other is still alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But I must needs say, that there was small ingenuity in acknowledging a mistake in that, wherein they had not been mistaken; or by endeavouring to avoid a <HI>reputed Rock,</HI> to run themselves on a certain Rock, even the Rock of Scandall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their brief and generall acknowledgment, that they vvere sorry that they had spoken in this point, vvhat had incurred the displeasure of the Temporall Lords, was no trespass on their own ingenuity, nor had shadovv of scandall to others therein.</P>
<P>I confess, men must not bear fals-witness, either against themselves or others; nor may they betray their right, especially when they have not onely a <HI>perso∣nall concernment</HI> therein, but also are in some sort <HI>Feoffees in trust</HI> for Posterity. However, vvhen a predominant Power plainly appears, which will certainly over-rule their cause against them; without scandall, they may (not to say in Christian prudence they ought) to wave the vindication of their priviledges for the present, waiting, wishing, and praying, for more moderate and equall times, wherein they may assert their right, with more advantage to their cause, and less danger to their persons.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For that the <HI>English</HI> Bishops had their vote in Parliament as a <HI>third Estate,</HI> and not in the capacity of <HI>temporal Barons,</HI> will evidently appear by these reasons following. For first, the Clergy in all other Christian Kingdoms of these Northwest parts make the <HI>third Estate</HI>; that is to say, in the <HI>German Empire,</HI> as ap∣pears by <HI>Thuanus</HI> the Historian, <HI>lib.</HI> 2. In <HI>France,</HI> as is affirmed by <HI>Paulus Aemi∣lius, lib.</HI> 9. In <HI>Spain,</HI> as testifieth <HI>Bodinus</HI> in his <HI>De Repub. lib.</HI> 3. For which con∣sult also to the <HI>Generall History of Spain,</HI> as in point of practise, <HI>lib.</HI> 9, 10, 11, 14. In <HI>Hungary,</HI> as witnesseth <HI>Bonfinius, Dec.</HI> 2. <HI>l.</HI> 1. In <HI>Poland,</HI> as is verified by <HI>Thu∣nus</HI> also, <HI>lib.</HI> 56. In <HI>Denmark,</HI> as <HI>Pontanus</HI> telleth us <HI>in Historia rerum Danicarum,
<PB N="53" REF="125"/>
l.</HI> 7. The <HI>Swedes</HI> observing antiently the same form and order of Government as was us'd by the <HI>Danes.</HI> The like we find in <HI>Camden</HI> for the Realm of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which antiently the Lords Spirituall, <HI>viz. Bishops, Abbots, Priors,</HI> made the third Estate. And certainly it were very strange, if the Bishops and other Pre∣lates in the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> being a great and powerfull body, should move in a lower Sphere in <HI>England,</HI> then they do elsewhere. But secondly, not to stand onely upon probable inferences, we find first in the History of <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> touching the Reign and Acts of <HI>King Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>that when his Funerals were ended, the three Estates of the Realm of</HI> England <HI>did assemble toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, and declared his Son King</HI> Henry <HI>the sixth, being an Infant of eight months old, to be their Soveraign Lord as his Heir and Successor.</HI> And if the Lords Spirituall did not then make the third Estate, I would know who did. Secondly, the Petition tendred to <HI>Rich∣ard</HI> Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> to accept the Crown, occurring in the Parliament Rolls, runs in the name of the <HI>three Estates</HI> of the Realm, that is to say,
<Q>The Lords Spirituall, and Temporall, and the Commons thereof. Thirdly, in the first Parliament of the said <HI>Richard</HI> lately Crowned King, it is said expresly, that at the request and by the consent of the three Estates of this Realm, that is to say, the Lords Spirituall, and Temporall, and Commons of this Land assem∣bled in this present Parliament, and by Authority of the same it be pronoun∣ced, decreed, and declared, That our said Soveraign Lord the King, was, and is the very and undoubted King of this Realm of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> Fourthly, it is acknowledged so in the Statute of 1 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 3. where the Lords Spiri∣tuall and Temporall, and the Commons in that Parliament assembled, being said expresly, and <HI>in terminis,</HI> to represent the three Estates of this Realm of <HI>England,</HI> did recognize the Queens Majesty to be their true, lawfull, and un∣doubted Soveraign Liege Lady, and Queen.</Q>
Add unto these the Testimony of Sir <HI>Edward Cook,</HI> though a private person, who in his Book of the Jurisdiction of Courts (published by order of the <HI>long Parliament</HI>) chap. 1. doth expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly say; <HI>That the Parliament consists of the Head and Body; that the Head is the King, that the Body are the three Estates,</HI> viz. <HI>the Lords Spirituall, and Temporall, and Com∣mons.</HI> In which words we have not onely the opinion and testimony of that learned Lawyer, but the Authority of the <HI>long Parliament</HI> also, though against it selfe. Those aged Bishops had been but little studied in their owne concern∣ments, and betray'd their Rights, if any of them did acknowledge any such mistake in challenging to themselves the name and priviledges of the third Estate.</P>

<P>In this long discourse, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath given in the severall Particu∣lars, whereof I, in my Church-History, gave the Totall summe; when saying, that there were passages in the old Statutes, which did countenance the Bishops sitting in Parliament in the Capacity of a THIRD ESTATE.</P>
<P>I have nothing to returne in Opposition, and heartily wish that his Argu∣ments (to use the Sea-man's phrase) may prove <HI>stanche</HI> and <HI>tight, to hold water,</HI> when some Common-Lawyer shall examine them.</P>
<P>But seeing the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> hath with his commendable paines go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>so farre</HI> in this point, I could wish he had gon a <HI>little further,</HI> even to answer the two Common Objections against the THIRD-ESTATE SHIP of Bishops.</P>
<P>The First is this: The Bishop not to speak of <HI>Bishops Suffragan,</HI> of the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> is a Bishop for all purposes, and intents, of Jurisdiction and ordination, yet hath he no place in Parliament, because not holding <HI>per In egram Baroniam,</HI> by <HI>an Intire Barony.</HI> Now if Bishops sat in Parliament as a THIRD-ESTATE, and not as so many Barons, why hath not the Bishop of <HI>Man,</HI> being in the Pro∣vince of <HI>York,</HI> a place in Parliament as well as the rest?</P>
<P>Secondly, If the Bishops sit as a THIRD-ESTATE, then Statutes made with∣out
<PB N="54" REF="126"/>
them are man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and defective, which in law will not be allowed, seeing there were some Sessions of Parliament wherein Statutes did passe, <HI>Excluso Clero</HI> (at least wise, <HI>Absente Clero</HI>) which notwithstanding are acknowledged Obligatory to our Nation.</P>
<P>I also, request him (when <HI>his Hand is in</HI>) to satisfie the <HI>Objection,</HI> taken from a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Alledged by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Animad∣vertor,</HI> former∣ly in his fourth Book.</NOTE> passage in the <HI>Parliament</HI> at <HI>Northampton</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, when the Bishops challenged their <HI>Peerage,</HI> viz. Non sedemus hîc Episcopi, sed Ba∣rones: Nos Barones, vos Barones, Pares hîc sumus. <HI>We sit not here as Bishops, but as Barons,</HI> We are Barons, <HI>You are Barons, here we are peers,</HI> which is much inforced by <HI>Anti-Episcopists.</HI> And whereas the Animadvertor translated it <HI>not as Bishops onely,</HI> it is more then questionable, that this <HI>interpolation</HI> ONLY will not be ad∣mitted by such who have a mind curiously to examine the matter.</P>
<P>I protest my integrity herein, that I have not started these Objections of my selfe, having had them urged against me; and though I can give a bungling An∣swer unto them, I desire that the Animadvertor (being better skill'd in Law) would be pleased (if it ever comes again in his way) to returne an Answer as short and clear as the Objections are; and I, and many more, will be bound to returne him thanks.</P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, Fol. 207. <HI>Now began the great and generall purgation of the Clergy in the Parliaments Quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, &amp;c. Some of whose offences were so foul, it is a shame to report them, crying to justice for punishment.</HI>] And it was time that such a purgation should be made, if <HI>their offences were so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul</HI> as our Author makes them. But first, our Author might have done well to have satisfied himselfe in all particulars, before he rais'd so foul a scandall on his Christian Brethren, and not to have taken them up upon hear-say, or on no better grounds then the credit of the <HI>first Century,</HI> which he after mentions. Which modesty he might have learnt, 1. From the Author of that scandalous and infamous Pamphlet, (whatsoever he was) desisting from the writing of a <HI>second Century,</HI> as being sen∣sible, that the <HI>Subject was generally odious.</HI> And certainly, if it were <HI>odious</HI> in that party to write the same, it must be much more <HI>odious</HI> in our Author to de∣fend the writing. He might have learnt it, 2. from the most excellent Master in the Schools of Piety and Morality which this Age hath given us, even the King himselfe; who as our Author telleth us, <HI>fol.</HI> 208. would not give way that any such Book should be written <HI>of the vicious lives of some Parliament Mini∣sters,</HI> when such an undertaking was presented to him. But if their <HI>Offences</HI> were so <HI>foul,</HI> the Writer of the Century had some reason for what he did, and our Author had some reason for what he saith, especially if the putting in of one <HI>Herb</HI> had not <HI>spoil'd all the Pot of Pottage.</HI> But first, <HI>Qui alterum incusat probri seipsum intueri oporiet,</HI> is a good rule in the Schools of Prudence, and therefore it concerns our Author to be sure of this, that all things be well at home, both in his owne Person and in his Family, before he throw so much foul dirt in the face of his Brethren. In which respect <HI>Manutius</HI> was conceived to be the un∣fittest man in <HI>Rome</HI> (as indeed he was) to perform the Office of a <HI>Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sor,</HI> though most ambitiously he affected and attain'd that Dignity; of whom it is affirmed by <HI>Velleius Paterculus, Nec quicquam objicere potuit Adolescentibus quod non agnosce∣ret Senex,</HI> that is to say, that he was able to object no crime to the younger sort, of which himselfe being then well in years, was not also guilty. And secondly,
<PB N="56" REF="127"/>

<P>First, as to my selfe, who am most knowing of my owne infirmities: I will confesse them to God, and not plead for them before man. If God's restraining grace hath bridled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from <HI>Scandalous obnoxiousnesse,</HI> may he alone have the honour thereof. As for other <HI>paines</HI> and <HI>spots</HI> in my Soul, I hope that He, (be it spoken without the least verball reflection) who is the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mal. 3.2.</NOTE> <HI>Fullers sope</HI> will scoure them forth with his Merit, that I may appear clean by Gods <HI>Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 12.13.</NOTE>I know full well who it is, that is tearmed the <HI>Accuser of his Brethren, even Satan himself</HI>; Hence it is that one observeth, he hath his name, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Dia∣bolus,</HI> Divell, and so also in <HI>Italian, French,</HI> Spanish, <HI>with some small variation.</HI> It being good reason, that he should keep his name in all Countries, who keeps his nature in all places being a constant <HI>delator and traducer</HI> of Gods ser∣vants; often, without cause; alwayes, without measure.</P>
<P>But I hope, I may say in this point, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan,</HI> I meane, I may justly thrust both <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Thing</HI> farre from me, even to light where it deser∣veth.</P>
<P>Some of my <HI>Brethren</HI> or <HI>Fathers</HI> rather, I <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>admire</HI> for their <HI>emi∣nences</HI>: others I <HI>commend</HI> and will endeavour to <HI>imitate:</HI> others guilty of hu∣mane infirmities, I desire to <HI>conceale</HI> their faults, and (that not taking effect) to excuse their <HI>persons.</HI> Such as are past my pleading for, fall under my <HI>pitty</HI> and have my <HI>Prayers</HI> that God would amend them: But <HI>willingly, much lesse causlessely,</HI> I will not accuse any; and my <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Tongue</HI> hath been, and shall be tender of their Reputations.</P>
<P>Proceed I now to what I have written concerning the <HI>Sequestred Clergy</HI> of England; wherein I will freely, God-willing, unbosome my mind, and <HI>if I pe∣rish I perish</HI>: I appeal to the Searcher of hearts, if I did not desire to do them all just favour, as I hope to find favour from him when I most need it. But as Marriners when they have both Wind and Tide against them, cannot make their desired Port in a straight Line, and therefore are fain to fetch a compass;
<PB N="57" REF="127"/>
Semnably, I desiring to <HI>gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifie my Brethren,</HI> and <HI>not destroy my selfe</HI>; was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aine to go about, that in any measure I might with safety do it. And there was no <HI>compassing</HI> of it without <HI>compaceing</HI> it; No <HI>reaching the End</HI> without <HI>going out of the Way.</HI></P>
<P>First, therefore, I did acknowledge what <HI>indeed</HI> could not be concealed, and what <HI>in truth</HI> must be confessed, viz. That some of the ejected Clergy were guilty of foul offences, to <HI>whom,</HI> and <HI>whom</HI> alone▪ the name of <HI>Baal</HI> and <HI>unsavory Salt</HI> did relate: Nor was it a wonder, if amongst <HI>Ten Thousand</HI> and more, some were guilty of <HI>Scandalous enormities.</HI></P>
<P>This being laid down, and <HI>yeilded</HI> to the <HI>violence</HI> of the <HI>times</HI>; I <HI>wrought my selfe</HI> by degrees, (as much as I durst) to insert what followeth in vindication of many others, rigorously cast out for following in their <HI>affections,</HI> their prece∣ding <HI>Iudgements</HI> and <HI>Consciences,</HI> and no scandall could justly be charged upon them, pleading for them as ensueth.
<Q><BIBL><HI>Church-History, Book 11. pag. 207.</HI></BIBL>
<P N="1">1. The witnesses against them were seldome deposed on Oath, but their bare complaints believed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many of the Complainers were <HI>factious People,</HI> (those most <HI>accusing</HI> their Sermons who least <HI>heard</HI> them), and who since have deserted the Church, as hating the profession of the Ministry.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many were charged with delivering <HI>false Doctrines,</HI> whose <HI>Posi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> were <HI>found</HI> at the least disputable. Such, those accused for Preaching <HI>that Bap∣tism washeth away Originall</HI> Sin, which the most learned and honest in the <HI>Assembly,</HI> in some sense, will not deny, namely that in the Children of God it cleanseth the <HI>condemning</HI> and <HI>finall peaceable</HI> commanding power of <HI>Originall</HI> Sin, though the <HI>stain</HI> and <HI>blemish</HI> thereof doth still remain.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some were meerly outed for their affections to the King's Cause; and what was <HI>Malignity</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> was Loyalty at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Yea many Moderate men of the opposite party, much be moaned such severity; that some Clergy men, blamelesse for life, and Orthodox for Doctrine, were ejected onely on the account of their faithfullnesse to the King's cause. And, as much corruption was let out by this Ejection (ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y scandalous Mini∣sters deservedly punished); so at the same time the Veins of the English Church were emptied of Much <HI>good blood,</HI> (some inoffensive Pastors) which hath made her Body <HI>Hydropicall</HI> ever since; ill humours succeeding in the room, by reason of too large and suddain evacuation.</P></Q></P>
<P>This being written by me, some <HI>ten</HI> (in the <HI>Parox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm</HI> of the Business) and printed <HI>some</HI> four years since, was as much as then I durst say for my <HI>Brethren,</HI> without running my selfe into apparent danger.</P>
<P>If the Papists take advantage at what I have written, I can wash my Hands, I have given them no just occasion; and I hope this my hust defence will prove satisfactory to the ingenuous, <HI>That I did not designedly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etract <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) Bre∣thren.</HI> But, if this my Plea finds no acceptance, and if I must groan under so unjust an accusation, I will endeavour to follow the Counsell of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mich. 7.9.</NOTE> Prophet: I <HI>will beare the Indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He plead my Cause and execute Iudgment for me: He will bring me forth to the Light, and I shall behold his righteousnesse.</HI></P>

<P>But to say truth, It is no wonder, if he concurre with others in the Condem∣nation of particular persons, since he concurrs with others in the condemnation of the <HI>Church it selfe.</HI> For, speaking of the separation made by Mr. <HI>Goodwin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>fol.</HI> 209. he professeth that, he rather doth believe that <HI>the sin∣full corruptions of the worship and Government of this Church, taking hold on their Consciences, and their inability to comport any longer therewith,</HI> was rather the <HI>true</HI> cause of their deserting of their Country, then that it was for <HI>Debt</HI> or <HI>Danger,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in his Book, had <HI>suggested</HI> of them.

<P>But my other story is more serious, intended for the satisfaction of our Au∣thor, and the Reader both.

The Key being turn'd which opened the way into his Study, I found him sitting in a chair, holding a paper in both hands, and his eyes so fixt upon that paper, that he observ'd me not at my coming in. Finding him in that posture, I thought it fit and manners to retire again. But the noise I made by my retreat, bringing him back unto himselfe, he recall'd me again, and told me after some short pawse, that he well remembred that he had sent for me, but could not tell for his life what it was about. After which he was pleas'd to say (not without tears standing in his eyes,) that he had then newly receiv'd a letter acquainting him with a Revolt of a Person of some Quality in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> to the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>; that he knew that the increase of Popery by such frequent Revolts, would be imputed unto him, and his Brethren the Bishops, who were all least guilty of the same; that for his part he had done his utmost, so far forth as it might consist with the Rules of Prudence, and the Preservation of the Church, to suppresse that party, and to bring the chief stick∣lers in it to condign punishment, to the truth whereof (lifting up his wet eyes to Heaven) he took God to witnesse; conjuring me (as I would answer it to God at the day of Judgement) that if ever I came to any of those places, which he, and his Brethren, by reason of their great age, were not like to hold long, I would imploy all such abilities as God had given me in suppressing that par∣ty, who by their open undertakings, and secret practices, were like to be the ruine of this flourishing Church. After some words of mine upon that occa∣sion, I found some argument to divert him from those sad remembrances, and having brought him to some reasonable composednesse, I took leave for the present; and some two or three dayes after waiting on him again, he then told me the reason of his sending for me the time before. And this I deliver for a truth on the faith of a Christian; which I hope will over-ballance any Evi∣dence which hath been brought to prove such <HI>Popish inclinations,</HI> as he stands generally charg'd with in our Author's History.</P>

<P>Let me add; It is not onely the <HI>Pride of the Church of Rome,</HI> which will not let-goe her <HI>Power</HI>; but also her <HI>Covetousnesse,</HI> which will not part with her <HI>Profit,</HI> which obstructeth all accommodation betwixt us. And if the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> would, the <HI>Court of Rome,</HI> will not, quit the <HI>Premises</HI>; and the latter hath an <HI>irre∣sistible influence</HI> on the former. In this point, the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> is like the Country-man, who willingly put his Cause to <HI>Arbitration</HI>; but on this condi∣tion, to have all the Land he sued for, with the full profits thereof, to a minute past, and his own costs and charges to a farthing.

<P>It was the Petulancy of the Puritans on the one side, and the pragmaticalness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesuits on the other side, which made the breach wider than it was at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first: and had these hot Spirits on both sides been charmed a while, mode∣rate Men might possibly have agreed on such equal tearms, as vvould have laid a sure foundation for the peace of Christendome.</P>

<P>Let us behold the <HI>Originall breach</HI> betvvixt the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> and Us.

<P>I behold the Colledge of <HI>Sorbonists</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> as far from Jesuitical pragmatical∣ness and Dr. <HI>I.

<P>My name is <HI>Thomas.</HI> It maketh me the more distrust thereof, because I see at this day most cruel Wars, betwixt the Crowns of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> both which agree to the heighth in the same Romish Religion.

<P>Now that all these in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are not so stiffely wedded to their own Opinions as our Author makes them, appears first by the Testimony of the Archbishop of <HI>Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ato</HI> declaring <HI>in the high Commission,</HI> a little before his go∣ing hence, that <HI>He acknowledged the Articles of the Church of England to be true, or profitable at the least, and none of them Heretical.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Animadvertor hath instanced in an ill Person, and in an ill time of the same Person. It was just when he was a taking his <HI>return to his vomit,</HI> and to leave the Land, When knowing himselfe obnoxious, and justly under the lash (for his covetous compliance with forreign Invitations) of King <HI>Iames</HI>; to get leave to be gone, he would <HI>say</HI> any thing <HI>here</HI>; and <HI>unsay it</HI> againe, <HI>elsewhere.</HI> As little <HI>heed</HI> is to be <HI>given</HI> to such a <HI>Proteus,</HI> as <HI>hold</HI> is to be <HI>taken</HI> of Him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It appears secondly by a Tractate of <HI>Franciscus de Sancta Clara,</HI> (as he calleth himself) in which he putteth such a Glosse upon the nine and thirty Articles of the Church of England, as rendreth them not inconsistent with the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>By that Parenthesis [<HI>as he calleth himselfe</HI>] it is left suspitious, that his <HI>true Name</HI> was otherwise. And he who would not use his own but a false <HI>Name,</HI> might (for ought I know) put a false <HI>Glosse</HI> upon our <HI>Articles</HI>; and though he PUTTETH such a sense upon them, it is questionable whether our <HI>Articles</HI> will accept thereof. To PUT something upon, sometimes answers to the <HI>Latin Word</HI> IMPONERE, which is to <HI>deceive</HI> and <HI>delude,</HI> and sometimes is <HI>Equivalent</HI> to our <HI>English Word</HI> IMPOSE, which soundeth the <HI>forceable</HI> or <HI>fraudulent Obtruding</HI> of a thing, against the <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Mind</HI> of <HI>Him,</HI> or <HI>That,</HI> whereon it is <HI>imposed.</HI> Lastly, the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> cannot warrant us, that the <HI>rest</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> will consent to the <HI>Iudgement</HI> of <HI>Franciscus de Sancta Clara</HI>; and if not, then is the breach betwixt us, left as wide as it was before.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And if without <HI>Prejudice to the Truth,</HI> the Controversies might have been composed, it is most probable that other Protestant Churches would have sued by their Agents to be included in the Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Animadvertor's Prudent and Politick Probability that other Protestant Churches would, by their Agents, sollicite an Inclusion into such a peace, min∣deth me of the Distich wrot on the sumptuous Cradle, gorgiously trimmed for the Child of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> by <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain.</HI>

<P>I cannot but commend the kindnesse and care of the Animadvertor, for keep∣ing this <HI>Babe</HI> when born; I mean the agreement betwixt Us and the Papists.

<P>Short and sharp, <HI>much matter</HI> in <HI>few Words,</HI> and <HI>little Truth</HI> in <HI>much Matter.</HI> Our <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in Relation to <HI>forraign Protestant Churches</HI> is here by the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> represented in a strange posture; like another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 16.22</NOTE> <HI>Ishmael, whose hand was against every one, and every one's against Him.</HI></P>
<P>That our <HI>Church</HI> is not HATED by the <HI>Calvinists</HI> appears by many and plain passages in the Books of those who are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>seeming Pillars</HI> amongst them <HI>Calvin, Beza, Zanchy, Deodat, Mollinaeus,</HI> &amp;c. who (notwithstanding some small differences betwixt us) lovingly give us the <HI>Right hand of Fellowship.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> discovers himselfe as little <HI>States-man</HI> as <HI>Divine</HI> in advi∣sing the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> by making <HI>Foes</HI> of her <HI>Friends,</HI> to make <HI>Friends</HI> of her <HI>Foes</HI>; by incurring the <HI>Enmity</HI> of <HI>forreign Protestants,</HI> thereby to <HI>procure</HI> the <HI>Amity</HI> of <HI>Papists.</HI></P>
<P>The best is, there is no danger to see that day.

<P>The <HI>Liturgy</HI> had been lookt on as a <HI>great Blessing</HI> of <HI>God</HI> upon this <HI>Nation,</HI> by the <HI>Generality of People,</HI> for the space of <HI>fourscore years</HI> and upwards; they found it established by the <HI>Law, seal'd</HI> by the <HI>Bloud</HI> of those that made it, confirm'd by many <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Religious Princes</HI>; and had almost no other forme of making their <HI>addresses</HI> to <HI>Almighty God,</HI> but what was taught them in the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Com∣mon Prayer.</HI> And could any discreet man think, or wise man hope, that a <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Prayer,</HI> so universally receiv'd, and so much esteem'd, could be <HI>laid by</HI> with∣out <HI>Reluctancy</HI> in those who had been so long accustomed to it? or called <HI>Obsti∣nacy</HI> or <HI>Doting</HI> in them, if they did not presently submit to every <HI>New Nothing,</HI> which in the <HI>Name</HI> of the then disputable <HI>Authority</HI> should be laid before

<P>I concurre with the Animadvertor in his Encomiastick Expressions on the Common Prayer. Otherwise, nothing new, occurs in <HI>this,</HI> which was not in the <HI>former</HI> Paragraph.

<P>And first beginning with <HI>Oxford,</HI> he let us know that, Fol. 231. <HI>Lately cer∣tain Delegates from the</HI> Univesity <HI>of</HI> Oxford, <HI>pleaded their priviledges before the</HI> Committee <HI>of</HI> Parliament, <HI>that they were onely</HI> visitable <HI>by the</HI> King, <HI>and such who should be deputed by him. But their Allegations were not of proof against the</HI> Para∣mount power <HI>of</HI> Parliament; <HI>the rather because a passage in an Article at the ren∣dition of</HI> Oxford, <HI>was urged against them, wherein they were subjected to such a</HI> Visita∣tion.] Our Author here subjects the <HI>University</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI> to the <HI>power</HI> of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and that not onely in regard of that <HI>Paramount power,</HI> which he as∣cribes
<PB N="70" REF="134"/>
unto the Parliament, that is to say, the two Houses of Parliament (for so we are to understand him) above all Estates; but also in regard of an Arti∣cle concerning the surrendry of <HI>Oxford,</HI> by which that <HI>University</HI> was <HI>subjected</HI> to such <HI>Visitations.</HI></P>

<P>When I see a <HI>Corslet shot thorough</HI> with a <HI>Musket bullet,</HI> and the <HI>Person woun∣ded</HI> that <HI>wore</HI> it, I may safely say, that <HI>Corslet</HI> is not of <HI>proof</HI> against the <HI>Musket.</HI> So when I behold the <HI>Pleadings</HI> of the <HI>Delegates</HI> neglected and null'd, I may say that <HI>de Facto</HI> they were not of <HI>proof</HI> against <HI>Parliamentary power.</HI> A passage pos∣sibly written by me, (such my affection to my <HI>Aunt Ox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord,</HI>) with more <HI>griefe</HI> then it is read by the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> with <HI>anger</HI>; but <HI>Truth</HI> is <HI>truth</HI> whether it be writ by one <HI>Sighing</HI> or <HI>singing</HI>; readd by one <HI>Smiling</HI> or <HI>Frowning.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Reader</HI> needs no <HI>Interpreter</HI> to expound the <HI>word Parliament,</HI> as taken ge∣nerally at this time, (<HI>Successe having beaten the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se thereof into Mens Heads</HI>) for the <HI>two Houses. Loqui cum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulgo</HI> in this case, I hope is no fault; These <HI>two Houses</HI> at this time maintained their ENTHYMEM to be a <HI>compleat</HI> SYLLOGISM concluding all <HI>Persons</HI> under them; presuming that the <HI>King,</HI> though not <HI>Per∣sonally,</HI> was <HI>Vertually</HI> with them, A position which I have no <HI>calling</HI> to examine. As for the <HI>Clause</HI> in the <HI>Article</HI> which <HI>hooked</HI> the <HI>University</HI> under <HI>Parliamentary Visitation,</HI> heare how the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> reports it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I find indeed, that it was agreed on by the Commissioners on both sides touching the Surrendry of that City;
<Q>That the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of <HI>Oxon,</HI> and the Governors and Students of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> of King <HI>H.</HI> 8. his Foundation, and all other Heads and Governors, Masters, Fellows, and Scholars of the Colledges, Halls, and Bodies Corpo∣rate, and Societies of the same University, and the publick Professors and Readers, and the Orator thereof, and all other persons belonging to the said University, or to any Colledges or Halls therein, shall and may, according to their Statutes, Charters and Customs, enjoy their antient form of govern∣ment, subordinate to the immediate Authority and power of Parliament.</Q>
But I find not, that any of the Heads or Delegates of that University were present at the making of this Article, or consented to it, or thought themselves oblig'd by any thing contained in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>This last <HI>Clause</HI> was eagerly urged by the <HI>Committee</HI> against the <HI>Delegates</HI> of the <HI>University,</HI> and I could wish they could as easily have untied the <HI>Knot,</HI> as <HI>Answered</HI> the hardest <HI>Objection</HI> of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> in the <HI>Divinity-Schools</HI>; The <HI>King</HI> when privately departing <HI>Oxford</HI> left (if not a <HI>Commission</HI>) at least <HI>Leave</HI> with the <HI>Lords</HI> to make as good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earmes for themselves, and all with them in the <HI>Citty</HI> besieged, as the <HI>Enemy</HI> would <HI>give</HI> and <HI>they</HI> could <HI>get</HI> in that streightned condi∣tion. The <HI>Vniversity</HI> therefore was urged by the <HI>Committee</HI> to have given an <HI>Im∣plicite consent</HI> to these <HI>Articles,</HI> and enjoying the <HI>Benefit,</HI> they must share in the <HI>Burthen</HI> thereof. To this, the <HI>Delegates</HI> made many <HI>faire</HI> and <HI>Civill Answers,</HI> strengthned with <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Reason:</HI> but alasse, great are the <HI>Odds,</HI> though <HI>Lear∣ning</HI> be the <HI>Answerer,</HI> where <HI>Power</HI> is the <HI>Opponent.</HI></P>

<P>Nor indeed could it stand with reason, that they should wave the patronage of a gracious Soveraign, who had been a <HI>Nursing Father</HI> to them, and put them∣selves under the arbitrary power of those who they knew minded nothing but destruction toward them. And that the University did not think it selfe oblig'd by any thing contained in that Article, appears even by our Author himselfe, who tells us in this very passage, that <HI>the Delegates from the University pleaded
<PB N="71" REF="134"/>
their priviledges before the Committee of Parliament, that they were onely visitable by the King, and such as should be deputed by him</HI>; which certainly they had never done (unlesse our Author will conclude them to be fools or madmen) had they before submitted to that <HI>Paramount power,</HI> which he adscribes unto the <HI>Houses.</HI> Nor did the Houses of Parliament find themselves impowered by this clause of the Article, to obtrude any such <HI>Visitation</HI> on them. And therefore when the Delegates had pleaded, and prov'd their priviledges, a Commission for a Visi∣tation was issued by the two Houses of Parliament in the name of the King, but under the new broad Seal which themselves had made; which notwithstan∣ding▪ the University stood still on their own defence, in regard that though the Kings name was us'd in that Commission, yet they knew well, that he had ne∣ver given his consent unto it. Whereupon followed that great alteration both in the <HI>Heads</HI> and <HI>Members</HI> of most <HI>Colledges</HI> which our Author speaks of.</P>

<P>The <HI>Animadvertor</HI> endeavours to runne me on one of these dangerous <HI>Rocks,</HI> either to <HI>condemne</HI> the <HI>University</HI> for <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Mad</HI> men, whom I <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hon∣our</HI> for <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Sober Persons,</HI> or else to make me incurre the <HI>Displeasure</HI> of the <HI>Parliament.</HI> And the <HI>Philosopher's Answer</HI> to the <HI>Emperour</HI> is well known, <HI>That it is ill Disputing with them that can command</HI> LEGIONS: The best is, I am not <HI>bound</HI> to <HI>answer</HI> to this dangerous <HI>Dilemma,</HI> keeping my selfe close to my <HI>Cal∣ling,</HI> viz. <HI>Reporting</HI> vvhat vvas <HI>done,</HI> but whether <HI>Iustly</HI> or <HI>unjustly,</HI> let others decide.</P>
<P>The <HI>Animadvertor's Boldnesse</HI> herein is for me to <HI>admire,</HI> not <HI>Imitate.</HI> When an <HI>Old Man</HI> vvas demanded the Cause of his <HI>Confidence,</HI> hovv he durst so freely tell a <HI>King</HI> of his <HI>faults,</HI> he rendred a double Reason of his Boldnesse, <HI>Orbit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s et Senectus.</HI> One, that he had <HI>no Children,</HI> and therefore <HI>Careless</HI> to preserve <HI>Posterity:</HI> the other, that he vvas <HI>extreamely Old,</HI> therefore lesse curious to <HI>keep</HI> that <HI>Life</HI> that vvas <HI>leaving him.</HI></P>
<P>How it fareth vvith the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> in these two Particulars, I know not; sure I am for my self, that I am not so old to be Weary of the <HI>World,</HI> (as I hope it is not of me); and <HI>God</HI> having given me <HI>Children,</HI> I vvill not destroy them, and hazard my selfe by running into needlesse Dangers.

<P>For whereas the <HI>Authour</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI> called <HI>Querela Cantabrigiensis</HI> hath told us of an <HI>Oath of Discovery,</HI> obtruded by the <HI>Visitors</HI> upon severall persons, where∣by
<PB N="72" REF="135"/>
they were sworn to detect one another, even their dearest friends. Our Author vvho vvas out of the storm, seeming not <HI>satisfied</HI> in the <HI>truth</HI> of this rela∣tion, must vvrite to Mr. <HI>Ash,</HI> who vvas one of those <HI>Visitors,</HI> to be inform'd in that which he knew before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Person more proper or probable to inform me herein, than Mr. <HI>Ash</HI> one of the <HI>Visitors,</HI> who I believed did both <HI>know the Truth</HI> and would not tell a <HI>false∣hood</HI> herein: I was so far from desiring <HI>Information</HI> in what (as the <HI>Animadver∣tor</HI> saith) I KNEW BEFORE, that I protest I know IT NOT YET, being left in such a <HI>Mist</HI> about this <HI>Oath of Discovery.</HI></P>
<P>On the one <HI>side,</HI> my Worthy <HI>Friend</HI> Mr. <HI>Peter Gunning, Fellow</HI> of <HI>Clare Hall,</HI> (eminent for his Learning and Honesty,) hath since assured me that such an <HI>Oath</HI> was <HI>offered</HI> and urged upon <HI>him</HI> by the <HI>Committee.</HI> On the <HI>other side,</HI> I am, on just grounds, daily confirmed in my Confidence, that neither the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Manchester,</HI> nor any under him by his <HI>Command</HI> or <HI>Consent</HI> enforced such <HI>an Oath,</HI> so that where to lay the Blame, I know not; and have neither <HI>List</HI> nor <HI>Leasure,</HI> further to enquire, who having <HI>Blistered</HI> my <HI>Fingers</HI> already, will <HI>burn</HI> my <HI>Hands</HI> no more in so dangerous a subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Our Author proceeds. And on the reading of Mr. <HI>Ash</HI> his Answer, declares expresly, that <HI>no such Oath was tendred by him to that University.</HI>] But first, Mr. <HI>Ash</HI> doth not absolutely deny, that there was any such Oath, but that he <HI>was a stran∣ger to it</HI>: and possibly he might be so far a <HI>stranger</HI> to it, as not to be an Actor in that part of the Tragedy. Secondly, Mr. <HI>Ash</HI> onely saith, that he <HI>cannot call to mind, that any such thing was mov'd by the Earl of</HI> Manchester; and yet I trow, such a thing might be mov'd by the Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> though Mr. <HI>Ash</HI> after so many years was willing not <HI>to call it to mind.</HI> Or else if no such Oath was <HI>tendred by him,</HI> as our Author is assur'd there was not, that part of the Tragedy might be acted by Mr. <HI>Good</HI> the other Chaplain, without communicating his In∣structions to his fellow <HI>Visitor.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ash,</HI> on serious and Solemn recollection, hath since given me Assurance, both by his word of Mouth, and <HI>Writing,</HI> that no such Oath was urged to his knowledge; and being a Minister of the Gospell, I am in Charity and Consci∣ence bound to believe Him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And therefore thirdly, I would know why Mr. <HI>Good</HI> was not writ to also, that having from him the like Certificate, our Author might have had the bet∣ter grounds for his <HI>unbelief,</HI> before he had pronounc'd so positively against the Author of that <HI>Querela.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason was because Mr. <HI>Good</HI> was dead, and (had I known whither) I did not know by what <HI>Carrier</HI> to convay my Letter unto him. I pronounced not positively against <HI>Querela</HI> in point of the Oath, which I left under very vehement <HI>Suspitions.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Fourthly, and finally, it is not easie to be thought, that the Author of that Book should have vented such a manifest falshood, especially in a matter so de∣rogatory to all Christian charity, and that neither the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Manchester,</HI> nor either of these two <HI>Chaplains,</HI> or any friends of theirs, should in the space of ten
<PB N="37" REF="135"/>
years and more, endeavour to wipe off such an odious imputation, till our Au∣thor out of pure zeal to the <HI>Paramount-power,</HI> played the Advocate in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will freely give all my <HI>Fees</HI> for my <HI>Advocation</HI> to the <HI>Animadvertor,</HI> and will Thank him too, if he will be pleased to take them from me to himselfe. It seemes I did not my <HI>Worke</HI> well, who had nothing but displeasure for my <HI>Wages.</HI></P>
<P>Possibly the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Manchester</HI> might <HI>not know,</HI> that the <HI>urging</HI> of such an <HI>Oath</HI> was objected against him and his; and probably, if he <HI>did know,</HI> he satisfied him∣selfe in his own <HI>Integrity</HI> and <HI>Innocence,</HI> leaving the <HI>Blame</HI> and <HI>Shame</HI> to fall on such as were guilty thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But to return again to <HI>Oxford,</HI> one of the first effects which followed on the alteration before remembred (though mentioned by our Author in another place) was the rifling of the Treasury in <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge, of which he tells us, <HI>lib.</HI> 9. <HI>fol.</HI> 234. That a <HI>considerable sum of Gold,</HI> being by Dr. <HI>Humphry</HI> (who had been Master of that Colledge) <HI>left in a Chest, not to be opened, except some great necessity urged thereunto, was lately shar'd between</HI> Dr. <HI>Wilkinson</HI> (who then held the place of President by the power of the Visitors) <HI>and the fellows</HI> there. But first, Our Author is mistaken in Dr. <HI>Humphry,</HI> though he be willing to entitle him (whom he calls a <HI>moderate Non-con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) to some benefaction. The summe there found amounted to above twelve hundred double Pistolets, the old Doc∣tor having no fewer than one hundred for his part of the spoile, and every fel∣low thirty a piece for theirs; each Pistolet exchang'd at sixteen shillings six pence, and yet the Exchanger got well by the bargain too. Too great a sum for Dr. <HI>Humphry,</HI> who had many Children, and no provident Woman to his Wife, to leave behind him to the Colledge, had he been so minded. The Money (as the Tradition went in that Colledge) was left there by the Founder, to remedy and repair such ruines, as either the casualty of fire, or the ravages of a Civil warre might bring upon it; to which the nature of the Coin being all <HI>French</HI> pieces (remember that the <HI>English</HI> at that time were Masters of a great part of <HI>France</HI>) gives a further testimony.</P>

<P>The Truth hereof will soon appear by the Sequele. For, if the Animad∣vertor shall <HI>inflame his smoaking faults,</HI> hollow in the Ears of every <HI>Dormant Sus∣pition,</HI> to awaken it against the memory of this Prelate, yea and hang the weight of his greatest Guiltinesse on the wyers of the slenderest proofe, then notwithstanding this his plausibility to the contrary premised, He will plainly appear to have a <HI>Pike</HI> (the sharpnesse whereof his Death hath not blunted) a∣gainst Him.</P>
<P>When one was to Preach the Funeral Sermon of a most vitious, and gene∣rally hated Person, all wondered what He would say in his praise, the Preach∣ers friends <HI>searing,</HI> his foes hoping, that, for his fee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would force his Consci∣ence to flattery.

<P>Now seeing besides the premises, common to all Christians, yea to all men many worthy works have been done by the <HI>Bishop</HI>; and especially, seeing <HI>known Animisities</HI> were betwixt him and the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> (which with <HI>Ingenuity</HI> is an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>-<HI>super-over-commanding</HI> motive to silence) the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> had better forborn all which followeth in my judgement, and in the Judgement of as ma∣ny <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>Religious men, of all orders and degrees in both Universityes,</HI> as ever sollicited him to write against my Church-history.</P>

<P>Fol. 227. <HI>He sueth to the Parliament for favour, and obtained it, whose General in a manner he becomes in laying siege to the Town and Castle of</HI> Abercon-way, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] This is the <HI>truth,</HI> but whether it be the whole <HI>truth,</HI> or not, I do more then doubt. His <HI>suing for</HI> and <HI>obtaining pardon from the Parliament,</HI> precedeth in the order of time, his being their <HI>General</HI>; and therefore it is not to be thought, but that he had done some special service to the Parliament to prepare the way for such a fa∣vour. Before his commitment to the Tower about the Bishops Protestation, he was grown as odious to the Commons, as before he had been honoured by them. He had liv'd some time with the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and is said to have done him good services in <HI>Wales</HI>; and (which is most) he had a fair temporall Estate, able to yeeld some thousands of pounds for Composition in <HI>Gold-smiths hall.</HI> So that there must be somewhat in it more then ordinary, which occasioned that he neither came under Fine nor Ransome, as the rest of the Kings party did. But what that was, whether he serv'd them with intelligence when he was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or by inhibiting his Tenants and Neighbours to pay their accustomed Taxes to the Kings Forces when he liv'd in <HI>Wales,</HI> I determine not. Certain it is, that before his redintegration with them, he had been in a manner besieged in his House of <HI>Penrin</HI> by the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> for the prohibiting of sending in such provisions as had been required; and that observing with what carel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssenesse the Kings Souldiers did attend that service, he caus'd a sally to be made out of the House, and slew many of them. Upon the merit of which service, and the promise of greater, it is no wonder if such Ministers and Sollicitors of his as were imploy'd in that businesse, compounded for him without <HI>fine,</HI> though not without money. That which our Author tells us of his being their General, seems to have been fore-signified some five or six years before the siege of <HI>Con∣way</HI> Castle. For I remember that about such time as he was prisoner in the Tower with the rest of the Bishops, his picture was sold commonly in black and white, in his Episcopal Roabs, with a squa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Cap on his head, a Rest in his hand, a Musket on his shoulder, and a Bandeleir about his neck.

<P>But our Author goes on, Ibid. <HI>He was very chaste in his Conversation.</HI>] And I hope so too, notwithstanding the scandalous reports of <HI>Weldon</HI> the <HI>namelesse Author</HI> aim'd at (in the following words) in his Pamphlet called the <HI>Court of King Iames,</HI> and some vulgar fames or hear sayes too much credited by a late Historian. But I must needs say, that I am not satisfied in the arguments which are brought to prove it. <HI>Wilson</HI> in his unworthy History of the reign of King <HI>Iames,</HI> makes him to be <HI>Eunuchus ab utero,</HI> an Eunuch from his Mother's womb. The author of the pamphlet called the <HI>Observator observed,</HI> conceives that <HI>Wilson</HI> went too far in this expression, and rather thinks, <HI>that he contracted some impotency by falling on a stake when he was a Boy, fol,</HI> 10. Our Author here seems to incline unto this last, assuring us from such <HI>who knew the Privacies and casual∣ties of his infancy,</HI> that this Arch-bishop was <HI>but one degree remov'd from a</HI> Mi∣sogynist, <HI>though to palliate his infirmity to noble Females he was most compleat in his courtly addresses.</HI> But first, the falsity and frivolousnesse of these defences leave the poor man under a worse suspicion than they found him in. His manly coun∣tenance, together with his masculine voyce, shewed plainly that he was no Eu∣nuch; and the agreeablenesse of his conversation with the female Sex, did as plainly shew, that he was no <HI>Misogynist,</HI> or Woman-hater. And secondly, admitting these surmises to be true and real, they rather serve to evidence his impotency than to prove his chastity; it being no chastity in that man to abstain from Women, who either by casualty, or by nature is disabled from such co∣pulations. The vertue of chastity consisteth rather in the integrity of the soul, than the mutilation of the body; and therefore more to be ascrib'd to those pi∣ous men, <HI>Qui salvis oculis foeminam vident,</HI> in <HI>Tertullian's</HI> language, than to the old Philosopher, who put out his eyes to avoid temptations of that nature. So that if this be all which they have to say for the Bishop's chastity, these advocates had shewed more wisdom in saying nothing, than speaking so little to the purpose.</P>

<P>I am sorry to see the Memory of this Bishop, since his decease, to fall on a <HI>sharper Stake</HI> than his Body did in his <HI>Infancy,</HI> even the <HI>Pen of the Animadvertors.</HI> I confesse, Chastity cannot necessarily be concluded from naturall debility, or casual impotency; there being a possibility of a <HI>frying heart</HI> in a <HI>freezing body,</HI> And we know who hath written, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.20.</NOTE> <HI>ut Eunuchus qui amplectitur virginem &amp; gemit.</HI></P>
<P>The casualty of his Infancy was by me mentioned, and cast in as <HI>super-pon∣dium</HI> or <HI>over-weight,</HI> to confirme such as were perswaded before, in his Chastity which was never called into Question by any person of credit.

<P>The conversableness of this <HI>Bishop</HI> with <HI>Women,</HI> consisted chiefly, (if not only) in his <HI>Treatments</HI> of great Ladyes and Persons of Honour, wherein he did perso∣nate the Compleatness of Courtesie to that Sex: otherwise a woman was seldom to be seen in his House.

<P>Our author proceeds Ibid. <HI>Envy it selfe cannot deny, but that whither soever he went, he might be traced by the foot-steps of his benefaction.</HI>] Amongst which <HI>benefa∣ctions</HI> it was none of the least, that in both the Universities he had so many Pen∣sioners; more (as it was commonly given out) then all the Noble-men and Bishops in the Land together: some of which received twenty Nobles, some ten pounds, and other twenty Marks <HI>per annum.</HI> And yet it may be said without envy, that none of all these Pensions came out of his own purse, but were laid as Rent-charges upon such Benefices as were in his disposing, either as Lord Keeper or Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and assign'd over to such Scholars in each Univer∣sity as applyed themselves to him. And because I would not be thought to say this without book, I have both seen and had in my keeping, till of late, (if I have it not still) an Acquittance made unto a Minister in discharge of the pay∣ment of a Pension of twenty Nobles <HI>per annum,</HI> to one who was then a Student in <HI>Christ-Church.</HI> The name of the parties I forbeare; he that receiv'd it, and he for whom it was receiv'd, (and perhaps he that paid it too) being still alive.

<P>His Pensioning so many Schollers, foundeth more to his credit, than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pau∣city of their Pensioners to the honour of other Lords and Bishops. It was impossi∣ble that so numerous Pensions, could all issue out of his own Purse, without great Impairing of his Estate. And therfore no wonder if he was not the <HI>Giver,</HI> but the bare <HI>disposer</HI> of some of them to <HI>Promising Pregnancyes,</HI> where <HI>Worth</HI> and <HI>Want</HI> did meet together in the same person. And though such payments were not costly to the Bishop, they were no lesse comfortable to such as received them; it being all one with the parched ground whether the <HI>Water-pot</HI> which be-sprinkleth it, be filled from the <HI>Spring,</HI> or from the <HI>River.</HI> This was don by him without any <HI>appearance of evill,</HI> with the free and full consent of such <HI>Incumbents</HI> as Hee pre∣sented, far from the shadow of Simonia call compliance, seeing besides the Sta∣tute to this purpose, in the reign of King <HI>Henry the eighth,</HI> the Injunctions of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> do countenance a Bishops assigning five pounds annually out of every hundred pounds of a Benefice to such uses. As for many of the Pensions he paied, I am since as well assured, they were expended out of his own Purse as I am confident the causelesse <HI>cavills</HI> in our Animadvertor's Book, were bred in his own braines, without any other's Suggesting them unto him.</P>

<P>Ibid. <HI>Much he expended on the Repair of</HI> Westminster Abbey-Church, &amp;c. <HI>The Library at</HI> Westminster <HI>was the effect of his bounty.</HI>] This though it be true in part, yet we cannot say of it, that it is either the <HI>whole truth,</HI> or nothing <HI>but the truth.</HI> For the plain truth is, that neither the charge of repairing that <HI>Church,</HI> nor furnishing that <HI>Library,</HI> came out of his own private Coffers, but the Chur∣ches rents: For at such time as he was made Lord Keeper of the great Seal; he caused it to be signified unto the Prebendaries of that Church, how incon∣venient
<PB N="78" REF="139"/>
it would be both to him and them to keep up the Commons of the Col∣ledge; and gaind so farre upon them that they pass'd over to him all the rents of that Church, upon condition that he should pay the annual pensions of the Prebendaries, School-Masters, Quire-men, and inferiour Officers, and main∣tain the Commons of the Scholars. The rest, amounting to a great yearly va∣lue, was left wholly to him upon his honourable word and promise to expend the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame for the good and honour of that Church. The surplusage of which expenses receiv'd by him for four years and upwards, amounted unto more than had been laid out by him on the Church and Library; as was offered to be proved before the Lords Commissioners at the visitation, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1635. And as for the Library at St. <HI>Iohns,</HI> it might possibly cost him more wit than money; many books being daily sent in to him (upon the intimation of his purpose of founding the two Libraries) by such as had either suits in Court, or businesse in Chancery, or any wayes depended on him, or expected any favours from him, either as Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> or Dean of <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>

<P>Our Author proceeds, Fol. 228. <HI>He was so great an honourer of the English Li∣turgy, that of his owne cost he caused the same to be translated into Spanish, and fairly printed, to confute their false conceipt of our Church,</HI> &amp;c.] If this be true, it makes not onely to his honour, but also to the honour of the English Liturgy, transla∣ted into more Languages then any Liturgy in the world, whatsoever it be; translated into Latine by <HI>Alexander Alesius,</HI> a learned <HI>Scot</HI> in King <HI>Edwards</HI> time; as afterward by Dr. <HI>Walter Haddon</HI> in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and his translation mended by Dr. <HI>Mocket</HI> in the time of King <HI>Iames</HI>: translated into <HI>French</HI> by the command of that King, for the Isles of <HI>Guernsey</HI> and <HI>Iersey</HI>: into <HI>Spanish</HI> at the charge of this Bishop (as our Author telleth us): and finally into <HI>Greek</HI> by one Mr. <HI>Petly,</HI> by whom it was dedicated and presented to the late Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the greatest Patron and Advancer of the English Liturgy. But secondly, I have some reason to doubt, that the Liturgy was not translated at the charges of Bishop <HI>Williams.</HI> That it was done by his pocure∣ment I shall easily grant: but whosoever made the Bill of Charges, the Church paid the reckoning; the <HI>Dominican</HI> Fryer who translated it, being rewarded with a Benefice and a good Prebend, as the Bishop himselfe did signifie by let∣ter to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been credibly informed by those who have best cause to know it, That it was done not onely by his procurement but at his Cost, Though I deny not but that a benefice might be conferred on the Fryer in reward of his paines. Thus far I am assured by such as saw it, That the Bishop (who had more skill in the Spanish then his policy would publiquely own), did with his owne hand correct every <HI>sheet</HI> therein.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And as for the printing of the book, I cannot think that it was at his charges neither, but at the charges of the Printer; it not being usuall to give the Prin∣ter, money and the copy too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Animadvertor so well practised in printing knowes full well, That though i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be usuall to give <HI>Money and Copies</HI> too for a saleable book, which being Printed in our owne tongue is every mans Money; yet a <HI>Spanish Book</HI> printed in <HI>England</HI> is chargeable, meeting with few <HI>buyers,</HI> because few <HI>understanders</HI> there∣of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And Thirdly, Taking it for granted, that the Liturgy was translated and printed at this Bishop's charges; yet does not this prove him to be so great an honourer of it as our Author makes him. For had he been indeed a true honou∣rer of the English Liturgy, he would have been a more diligent attendant on it than he shewed himself: never repairing to the Church at <HI>Westminster</HI> (where∣of he was Dean) from the 18. of <HI>February</HI> 1635. when the businesse of the great Pew was judged against him, till his Commitment to the Tower in <HI>Iu∣ly</HI> 1637.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>One reason why he seldome came to Prayers to Westminster Church, was, because he was permitted but little to live there, after he fell into the King's displeasure, being often sent away the day after he came thither. On the same token, that once Sr. <HI>Iohn Cook</HI> being sent unto him to command him to avoid the Deanery; Mr. <HI>Secretary,</HI> said the Bishop, <HI>what Authority have you to command a Man out of his owne House</HI>? Which wrought so much on the old Knight, that he was not quiet till he had gotten his owne pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever going to the Chappell of the <HI>Tower</HI> (where he was a Prisoner) to attend the Divine Service of the Church, or receive the Sacrament, from <HI>Iuly</HI> 1637. when he was committed, to <HI>November</HI> 1640. when he was enlarged. A very strong Argument that he was no such Honourer of the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI> as is here pretended: A Liturgy most highly esteemed in all places whereso∣ever it came, and never so much vilified, despis'd, condemn'd as amongst our selves; and those amongst our selves who did so vilifie and despise it, by none more countenanced then by him, who is here said to be so <HI>great</HI> an <HI>Honourer</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though (for reasons best known to himselfe) he went not to Prayers in the Tower Chappell, yet was he his own Chaplain to read them in his own Cham∣ber. And let me add this memorable passage thereunto.</P>
<P>During his durance in the Tower, there was a Kinsman of Sr. <HI>William Balforés</HI> then Lieutenant, a Scotish man (and his name, Mr. <HI>Melvin too</HI>) who being mortally sick, sent for Bishop <HI>Williams</HI> to pray with him. The Bishop read to him <HI>the Visitation of the sick,</HI> having fore-acquainted this dying man, That there was a form of Absolution in this Prayer, if he thought fit to receive it: Wherewith Mr. <HI>Melvin</HI> was not onely well satisfied, but got himselfe up as well as he could on his knees in the bed, and in that posture received Abso∣lution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But for this Blow our Author hath his Buckler ready, telling us, Ibid. <HI>Not out of Sympathy to Non-conformists, but Antipathy to Arch-bishop Laud, he was
<PB N="81" REF="140"/>
favourable to some select Persons of that Opinion.</HI> An Action somewhat like to that of the Earl of <HI>Kildare,</HI> who being accused before <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, for burning the Cathedrall Church of <HI>Cassiles</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> profess'd ingeniously, <HI>That he would never have burnt the Church, if some body had not told him that the Bishop was in it.</HI> Hate to that Bishop, an Arch-Bishop of <HI>Ireland,</HI> incited that mad <HI>Earl</HI> to burn his Cathedrall Church. And hate to Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> the Primate and Metropo∣litan of all <HI>England,</HI> stir'd up this Bishop to raise a more unquenchable Com∣bustion in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> So that we may affirm of him as <HI>Tertullian</HI> (in another case) of the Primitive Christians, viz. <HI>Tanti non est bonum, quanti est odium Christianorum.</HI> But are we sure that he was favourable to the Non-Conformists out of an antipathy to Bishop <HI>Laud</HI> onely? I believe not so. His antipathy to the King did as strongly byass him that way, as any thing else. For which I have the Testimony of the Author of the History of King <HI>Charls,</HI> pub∣lisht 1656. who telleth us of him, <HI>That being malevolently inclin'd (about the losse of the great Seal</HI>), &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not advocate for all the actions of Bishop <HI>Williams,</HI> and though the <HI>Animadvertor</HI> beholds my pen as over-partiall unto him, yet I know who it was that wrote unto me, <HI>Semper es iniquior in Archiepiscopum Eboracensem.</HI></P>
<P>I am a true honourer of his many excellent virtues, and no excuser of his Faults, who could heartily wish, That the latter part of his Life had been like the beginning thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Heylyn.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And so I take my leave of this great <HI>Prelate,</HI> whom I both reverence for his Place, and honour for his Parts, as much as any. And yet I cannot choose but say, that I find more reason to condemn, then there is to commend him; so that we may affirm of him as the Historian doth of <HI>Cajus Caesar,</HI> Son of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and Nephew to the great <HI>Augustus,</HI> viz. <HI>Tam variè se gessit, ut nec laudaturum magna, nec vituperaturum mediocris materia deficiat, as my Author hath it.</HI> And with the same Character, accommodated to our Author, and this present History, I conclude these <HI>Notes</HI>; subjoyning onely this old Saying as well for my com∣fort as defence, viz.
<Q><L>Truth, though it may be blam'd, can never be sham'd.</L></Q></P>

<P>Here the Animadvertor doth Tickle and Pinch me both together, yet nei∣ther will I laugh nor cry, but keep my former composure.</P>
<P>I will take no notice of a piece of <HI>MEZENTISM</HI> in his joyning of the Dead and Living together, and conceive my selfe far unworthy, to be parallel'd in the least degree with his Eminences.</P>
<P>However I will endeavour with the Gladiators <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>honestè decumbere,</HI> that when I can <HI>fight</HI> no longer, I may <HI>fall</HI> handsomely, in the Scene of this Life.</P>

<P>You may be pleased to remember that some two years since being informed by our friend <HI>Mr. Davenport,</HI> that you took some excepti∣ons at what I had written concerning you, in my Church-History, I returned you an Answer to this Effect.</P>
<Q>That I would make you just reparation, either in the next Edition of my History, or in another Book which I was about to set forth <HI>Of the Worthies of England:</HI> choosing therein the most proper and conspicuous place, which might render it most visible to the Reader.</Q>
<P>This last Book had since been printed, had not the unhappy difference between <HI>Dr. Heylyn,</HI> and me, retarded it.</P>
<P>What I wrote concerning your Accusation in the House of Commons, I transcribed out of the Manuscript journalls of that House. As for your purgation in the House of Lords, I knew not thereof: which maketh such my omssion the more excusable.</P>
<P>I am now right glad, that you did so clearly vindicate your innocence. In my next Edition, I will do you all possile right (with improvement) that my Pen can perform: as also, God Willing, when I come to treat, in my intended Book, of the Cathedrall of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, joyning with Hundreds more of my Profession, in thanks to you for your worthy Work on the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> and desiring the Continuation and increase of Gods blessing on your studies, who do abide the <HI>Champion for our Religion</HI> in forraign parts, know that amongst your many honourers, you have none more affectionate than</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I could have wished, that in your book entituled, <HI>a Case concerning the buying of Bishops Lands, with the lawfullnesse thereof,</HI> &amp;c. you had forborn this following expression against me.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Part. 1. pag. 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>As that flashy jeering Author of the late published History of the Church (upon hear-say onely, and out of Resolution <HI>calumniari fortiter</HI>) hath falsely re∣ported him.</P></Q>
<P>Let us go back to the occasion of these words. When Dr. <HI>Hacket, May</HI> the 11<SUP>th</SUP>. 1641. made a Speech, in behalfe of the <HI>Deans,</HI> and <HI>Chapters</HI> of England, for the preventing of the alienation of their Lands and revenues, you returned an Answer thereunto; and about the conclusive Result thereof, is our present contest.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Burges.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You say, you onely concluded those things unalienable from the Church, which were setled upon it by Divine Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fuller.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Report, you concluded <HI>Deans</HI> and <HI>Chapters</HI> lands alienable without sin of Sacriledge, from that particular Use; yet so as that they ought still to be pre∣served to the Church in generall.</P>
</SP>
<P>I confesse, I neither was, (nor might be) present in the Parliament: and therefore must take it on <HI>Hear-say.</HI> However I distinguish on <HI>hear-say</HI> which is double,
<LIST>
<HEAD>Hear-say</HEAD>
<ITEM>Common.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Credible.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I conceive mine to be of the latter and better sort. And I have no other way to defend my selfe, than by appealing to many members of the House then pre∣sent, still alive, and firmly remembring that transaction.</P>
<P>Surely, Sir, the Parliament never brought into question, <HI>Whether things might be alienated from the Church, which by Divine Right were setled there∣on.</HI> It was inconsistent with their prudence, amounting in effect to this que∣stion, <HI>Whether Gods, or their power were the highest.</HI> And, Sir, if you con∣cluded no more than what you say, you <HI>concluded</HI> what was never <HI>controver∣ted</HI> by any Christian.</P>
<P>Whereas you call me a <HI>FLASHY WRITER,</HI> God forbid that in all my Books such a <HI>flash</HI> of <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>falshood</HI> should be found, as falls from your Pen in your own praise.</P>

<P>Albeit <HI>Dr. Burges</HI> performeth more service in that Church, than any Bishop that ever sat there.</P></Q>

<Q><BIBL><HI>Part. 1. pag. 20.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And that this was the high-way, wherein the Popish Clergy of England long before, (as well as since) the Conquest, constantly travelled; take one Testimony more of that fa∣mous <HI>Gildas</HI> the Elder, surnamed Sapiens: who being a Brittain Presbyter, within the <HI>sixth Century, or hundred of years,</HI> after Christ, thus chargeth the Popish Clergy of his time, who had sacked their Principles from <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk, sent from <HI>Rome</HI> on purpose to advance the State and Pompe of the Clergy, under Colour of plan∣ting the Christian faith in England. For thus he saith, <HI>Britannia habet sacerdotes, &amp;c.</HI> Brittain (saith he) hath Priests, but some of them very dol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: very many Mini∣sters, but many of them impudent ones: Clergy men, but very <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>The Latin word being</HI> Raptores, <HI>might (by the Doctors fa∣vour) be bet∣ter Englished</HI> Plunderers.</NOTE> Thieves or Cheaters: Pastors, as they are termed; but, in truth Woolves, standing to slay and flay the souls of the sheep: for that they seek not the good of the people, but the Grambing of their owne bellies. They have Church houses, but they never repaire to them, unlesse for their own filthy lucre.</P></Q>
<P>But know, Sir, that herein you are much mistaken in your Chronology, for
<Q><P><HI>Gildas</HI> died, saith Arch-bishop, <HI>Usher</HI> in his <HI>Index-Chronolog.</HI> pag. 1144. in the year of our Lord, 570.</P>
<P><HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk came not over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto England untill the year 596. as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s notoriously known to all that open a Book.</P></Q></P>
<P>I am therefore confident that <HI>Gildas</HI> his complaint related onely to his Coun∣try-men, the Brittish Clergy without the least reflection on the Saxon, which as yet were unconverted pagans. And therefore to say, they had sucked in principles from <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monk, is an Anti-Chronism, which cannot be justified.</P>
<P>Respect, Sir, to your age, degree, and profession, charms my Pen into some re∣verence unto you; and because, I hear, abler Men are undertaking your Con∣futation, I add no more, but remain,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am sensible of a mistake in the Catalogue of <HI>Vice-Chancellours</HI> and <HI>Proctours</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> (besides a needless repetition of <HI>two, twice</HI>) betwixt the years 1617, and 1620. <HI>inclusively.</HI> It arose from some difference betwixt the written Coppies I used, and such (I believe, the truer) as are since printed.</P>
<P>I see <HI>what,</HI> not <HI>whither,</HI> to <HI>sly,</HI> who can <HI>discover,</HI> do <HI>confesse,</HI> but [for the present] cannot <HI>rectify</HI> the <HI>Errour,</HI> craving the charitable assistance of my <HI>Mothers</HI> Sons herein.</P>
<P>The best is, all the mistake lyeth within the compasse of <HI>three years,</HI> (all <HI>officers</HI> being right <HI>before</HI> and <HI>af∣ter</HI>) and the <HI>Fortunes</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> the Truth I mean of our <HI>Church-History,</HI> is not concerned therein.</P>
