<HEAD><HI>Prologue,</HI> spoken by a young Lady.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ladies,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<L>Y'Are welcome, — and we hope y'are all sharp set,</L>
<L>Good Appetites excuse a homely Treat;</L>
<L>This was intended for our selves alone,</L>
<L>From whom our Masters fear'd no cens'ring frown:</L>
<L>But aw'd, and dazl'd by your piercing eyes,</L>
<L>(For, though expected, you like Death surprize)</L>
<L>They humbly bow, — and beg a kind excuse,</L>
<L>For straiten'd time, and a disorder'd House;</L>
<L>Hoping, the want of practice, fitting dress,</L>
<L>And glorious Scenes, may make our failings less:</L>
<L>As if defects could purchase good success.</L>
<L>This might appease an accidental Guest;</L>
<L>But you'r invited, and expect a Feast:</L>
<L>Enlarged hopes, and longing looks y'have brought,</L>
<L>Fine Dances, Songs, and Shew, swell ev'ry thought:</L>
<L>Such things our Masters meant; but strove so fast</L>
<L>To win the prize, we fall with too much hast.</L>
<L>Like eager Gard'ners, that make Nature post</L>
<L>The Flow'rs to early births, which being forc'd,</L>
<L>Their sweet perfume and native beautie's lost.</L>
<L>If we miscarry, let them feel the smart,</L>
<L>They hardly gave us time to read a Part:</L>
<L>Yet — if w'are out, — I fear 'twill break my heart. —</L>
<L>Courage! be gone dull fear, and sullen doubt:</L>
<L>The Cause! the Cause we fight shall bear us out.</L>
<L><HI>Beauties Triumph,</HI> — Beauty! your joy and care,</L>
<L>The crown of Peace, and the reward of War.</L>
<L><HI>Ladies,</HI> Your int'rest your assistance calls;</L>
<L>Your Empire's lost if <HI>Beauties Triumph</HI> falls:</L>
<L>If any Lover his applause denies,</L>
<L>Kill the Rebel, — stab him with your eyes.</L>
<L>Sound a charge, — we'l nor take no quarter,
<STAGE>Musick flourish.</STAGE></L>
<L>She that falls is Educations Martyr.</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>The Curtain being drawn, <HI>Fate</HI> is discover'd sitting on a Throne, dress'd in a dark-colour'd Robe, powder'd with Swords, Stars, Daggers, Books, Flames and Crowns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — a Crown on his head, a Globe at his feet, and a great Book open be∣fore him: near his feet sit the Three Fatal Sisters, one holding a Distaff, another Spinning and drawing out Threads, and the third cutting them. On the Stage stand a King and Queen crown'd, and richly habited; a Hero crown'd with Laurel, and a Slave chain'd: — near him a beautiful Lady, and a de∣spairing Lover: — a man and woman, whose dress express Poverty and Misery: in the midst of all stands Death, threat∣ning with his Dart and Hour-glass. — Thus all continue, while a solemn Ayr is play'd by Violins, Rechorders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — which done, all but Death kneel to <HI>Fate</HI> and the Three Sisters.</STAGE>

<L>And make thy Spinsters quit their tools.</L>
<STAGE>The Lover sings, and one of the Unfortunate.</STAGE>
<L>We court the fate from which they fly,</L>
<L>For death, for death the wretched cry,</L>
<L>Oh change our doom, Oh change our doom, Oh change our doom</L>

<HEAD><HI>Epilogue,</HI> spoken by a young Lady.</HEAD>
<L>LIke cloister'd Nuns with virtuous zeal inspir'd,</L>
<L>From publick noise, and vicious ease retir'd,</L>
<L>Here we have all that's by the good admir'd.</L>
<L>While thus the loosest of our time is spent,</L>
<L>'Tis advantageous, sweet, and innocent.</L>
<L>And when our thoughts to serious things are bent,</L>
<L>One in rich works with lively colours tells</L>
<L><HI>Lucretia</HI>'s Rape, or mourning <HI>Philomels:</HI></L>
<L>Each chast beholder sighs and drops a tear,</L>
<L>To burn the well-wrought Silk they scarce forbear,</L>
<L>So sad and moving does the work appear:</L>
<L>Oh that the Ravisher were here! one cries,</L>
<L>Thus would I rend the bloudy Tyrant's eyes;</L>
<L>Then for his crime some harmless Flower dyes,</L>
<L>Whose falling head, as if indeed 'twere pain'd,</L>
<L>Sheds dewie tears upon the murth'rers hand.</L>
<L>Some Hero's praise in sacred Verse kept long,</L>
<L>Another sings to th'Lute —</L>
<L>While ev'ry string seems turn'd into a tongue,</L>
<L>And sends soft ecchoes to the joyfull Song.</L>
<L>Anothers diff'rent mind more pleasure takes,</L>
<L>In various forms to mould the painted Wax;</L>
<L>Such shape, such beauty in each piece is shown,</L>
<L>Nature sits pale, or blushing on her own,</L>
<L>To see her pride by curious Art out-done.</L>
<L>While buzzing Infamy, with venom'd wing,</L>
<L>Haunts clam'rous pleasures that in Cities ring,</L>
<L>Thus we enjoy the sweets without the sting.</L>
<L>When riper age with flatt'ring care's oppress'd,</L>
<L>Toil'd with false joys, 'twill sadly be confess'd,</L>
<L>Of all our lives these happy hours were best.</L>
