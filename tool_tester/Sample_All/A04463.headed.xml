<HEAD>To the right honorable, Sir <HI>William Cicil Knight, Lorde</HI> high Treasorer of England: and to the right honorable L. Robert Dudley, Earle of Leicester, two of her Maiesties <HI>most honorable priuie Counsaile, &amp; most worthie Chauncelours of</HI> both the Vniuersities, Oxforde and Cambridge.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Ntrue reportes and sclaunders can neither giue falsehoode any credite among the wise, nor disgrace the due estimation of the trueth. How∣beit, it seemeth there are some, which hope it will turne them to no small aduauntage, if to other their secrete and wicked practises, they ioyne a sleyght of ill spea∣king &amp; of sclaundering the writings, the godly sayings, the life and the death of those, whome it hath pleased God to vse to the setting forth of his Gospel, and there∣by to the great comfort of his people.</P>
<P>Among others, vpon whom this hath bene practised, they haue made some especiall choice of the late <HI>Bi∣shop of Salisburie,</HI> a man of famous memorie, whose life and death is truely and syncerely written by <HI>M. Do∣ctour Humfrey.</HI> Howsoeuer they dealt vncharitably with him in his life, Christian and godly discretion would they should spare to reproche the dead. Or, if not so, yet
<PB REF="3"/>
in wisedome they might foresee, that when matters are called to tryall, such things cannot passe for currant &amp; lawfull, wherof some due proofe hath not bene yeelded.</P>
<P>Yet, as though the discredit of that one man (who in great humilitie did acknowledge himselfe inferiour to many godly fathers then liuing in this Church of Eng∣land) were ynough for them to ouerthrowe all that whole worke, which the Almightie God hath by his right hand and strong arme established: they deliuer by tradition certaine false obseruations, of his either sim∣ple, or negligent, or wilfull and malicious gathering, and abusing the holy Scriptures of God, and the aun∣cient writings of the Fathers.</P>
<P>It is a harde thing for him that speaketh much, to speake nothing worthy iust reprehension. But it is much harder to escape the reprehension of corrupt Iudges, e∣uen when he shal speake most vprightly. His defence is abroade, published by himselfe. And, notwithstanding the endeuour of a learned aduersarie was to empeache it: yet by his last and a moderate answere, he auouched it good, and approued his plaine and syncere dealing to the consciences of all men.</P>
<P>Whom it may please to vnderstande, after what sort he prepared himselfe to the accomplishment of those two notable bookes, of the defence of the Apologie, and the Replie, which are as two double Canons pre∣pared for the battery of errour and superstition, must needes confesse his diligence, and reuerent procee∣ding in such cause, to haue bene such, as for which he may well be compared with any, whomsoeuer the for∣mer, or this present age, hath thought therefore wor∣thie commendation. For, besides his aduised obserua∣tion of all such things, as in the aduersaries bookes de∣serued answere: and, besides that he disposed a summa∣rie, and full collection of such matter, as he would vse for the disproofe of the same, the which he conceiued in short notes: this may be a notable testimonie, that
<PB REF="3"/>
he had purpose to set downe the aucthorities out of the Fathers, and the quotations, truely and playnely: whereas in times before, hee had gathered sundrie bookes of common places out of the Greeke, and La∣tine, and later writers, he did peruse a fresh the authors themselues, and made euery where in them speciall markes, for the difference of such places, whereofhee made choyce. Those were all drawen forth, and layde to their themes by certeine scholers, who wrote them out by such direction, as he had giuen vnto them. So re∣uerent regard had he to do the worke of the Lord, and to defend the trueth faithfully.</P>
<P>With like reuerence also did he in all places where he was occasioned to preach, handle the word of God. Albeit his giftes of reading, and vnderstanding, &amp; me∣morie were great, yet it appeareth he did seldome, or neuer deliuer any exposition vpon any peece of scrip∣ture, before any Congregation in the meanest parish of the countrie, but vpon diligent studie, and whereof he drewe his notes. In this his care, Gods prouidence wrought mercifully for his Church, that so there might be some way to deliuer in common vnto all, the fruites of those godly trauailes, which he gaue forth to some one especiall part of the Church. Hereby it is, that these his Sermons preached before her Maiestie, and at Paules crosse, come nowe to the reading of all such, before whome they were once spoken: to seeke that of them in true practise of Christian religion, for which they were in their times vttered. Why I make choyce of these, among so many, so excellent his sermons pro∣nounced in those places, if any be curious to aske, let him aduisedly consider the state of Gods Church a∣mongst vs in these dayes, and bestowe his paynes to reade these, which are offered to his Christian iudge∣ment, and then make to himselfe a charitable answere. And if at such seuerall times as that reuerende father, in the feare of God, moued his petitions before the
<PB REF="4"/>
conscience either of her highnesse, or of your honors, or of any others, the good children and seruantes of God, he were so well acquitted, that he was thought to speake vprightly in true zeale, for the aduauncement of Gods glorie, and like a wise buylder of the house of God: no doubt, in this rehearsall of them altogether, they shall worke that wholsome effect, if through the assistance of Gods holy spirite, they be considered now with as great diligence, as hee was then heard with good attention.</P>
<P>Your honours haue wel declared, that you measured not your louing affection to him by the short terme of his life: which giueth great hope that his humble re∣questes, so many as are to craue ayde and furtherance of aucthoritie, shall in good time be preferred. They are such, as shew how desirous he was to see the peace and prosperitie of Ierusalem, and that the kingdome of God might neuer againe be taken away from vs. He sheweth what thinges they are, by which this may bee brought to passe: that among all the meanes which mans wisedome can prouide, next to the high meanes of princely authoritie, the chiefest is, that all particular Churches may bee furnished with sufficient, learned, and godly Ministers: and therefore that tender &amp; due care be had, to encrease the nomber of them. Their seruice is most needeful in the ouerthrowe of Iericho, the citie which God will haue destroyed: and in the buylding vp vnto God his Temple at Ierusalem. The care which Magistrates take hereof, and that laborers may be sent into the Lordes haruest, which may de∣fende the cause of Christ against those which charge the Gospel to be heresie, and that the things which he hath done for vs, are wrought by the power of Beel∣zebub: and which as good watchmen attending their warde, may stirre vp the people to knowe the season, that the night is passed, and the day is come, that it is time to cast away the workes of darkenesse, and to put
<PB REF="4"/>
on the armour of light: shall witnesse for them, what zeale they beare to the house of God. If the ministers be mindefull to perfourme their duetie: if the Lordes haruest be not neglected: if the defence for the Gos∣pel finde vpright Iudges: if all that giue outward shew of zeale be in deede zealous, and worke the fruites of zeale: what hope may they of Iericho haue, that their cursed dwellings shal stand? or why shall Israel mistrust that the Temple of God shall not receiue againe the former and perfect beautie?</P>
<P>Nowe, because euery where in these sermons hee commendeth the necessary vse of godly learning, and is an humble suter for patronage thereof: I can not but present them vnto your honours, our patrones, and fathers, &amp; right honourable Chauncelours of both the Vniuersities: that seeing the benefite of this your gra∣cious protection, hath, and doeth, and shall reache it selfe so farre, to do so much good to the whole Church of God: you may at home and with your selues reioyce in the comfort of a good conscience, for the manifold fruites of your fauour bestowed in such sort, and all that haue the loue of the trueth, may earnestly praye vnto God for your honours, that he will continue his goodnesse towardes you, and giue you long and pros∣perous dayes in this life, and after, a ioyfull enterance into his glorie.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N diuers maners god spake &amp; opened himselfe to our fa∣thers: by visions &amp; dreames, by sacraments, by angels, by plaine expresse words, by al∣legories, by secret &amp; mystical vnderstanding, where one thing is couered vn∣der another. And al this did he that he might cō∣descende to our capacitie: that wee might bee conuerted and saued: that we might be guyded
<PB REF="6"/>
in the right way, and not goe aside, neither to the right hande nor to the left. By vision GOD spake to <HI>Ezechiel,</HI> as appeareth in the firste Chapter of his prophecie, <HI>The wheeles which he saw were horible to behold, they were ful</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 1.</NOTE> <HI>of rings, and the rings were full of eyes: the foure beasts were also terrible, they had fa∣ces like a man, like a lion, like a bullock, and like an eagle.</HI> In dream God spake to <HI>Samuel,</HI> saying, <HI>Beholde I wil doe a thing in Israel,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 3.</NOTE> <HI>wherof whosoeuer shal heare, his two eares shall tingle &amp;c.</HI> Touching Sacramentes God him selfe saith, <HI>Thou shalt shew thy Sonne in</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 13.</NOTE> <HI>that day, saying this is done, because of that which the Lord did vnto me whē I came out of Egipt, thou shalt set apart vnto the lord al that first openeth the wombe &amp;c. And whē thy sonne shal aske thee to morrow, saying, What is this? thou shalt then say vnto him, with a mighty hande the Lorde brought vs out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. For when Pharao was hard hearted agaynst our departure, the Lord then slue al the first borne in the lande of Egypt, from the first born of man, euen to the first born of beast: therefore I sacrifice vnto the Lorde all the males that first open the wombe, but al the first borne of my sonnes I redeeme.</HI> Some∣times he spake by Angels, as by sundrye exam∣ples
<PB REF="6"/>
it may appeare. Sometimes by him selfe in his owne person, as he spake to <HI>Moses</HI> face to face. Sometimes by playne expresse wordes, <HI>Thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6.</NOTE> <HI>thy heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy might.</HI> And againe, <HI>Thou shalt haue</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 5.</NOTE> <HI>none other goddes before my face, thou shalt make thee no grauen image &amp;c.</HI> These are playne woordes: these are the woordes which our Lord GOD hath spoken. Some tymes he expressed his holy will, not in words, or visions, or in such sort as I haue shew∣ed, but onely by some mysticall or secret Al∣legory, by some deede which the people sawe done before their eyes: of which kynd is this which we haue now to consider. Therefore <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esai. 5.</NOTE> hath God sayde by the Prophet, <HI>What coulde I haue done any more to my vineyard, that I haue not done vnto it? What shoulde I doe, but it hath byn done? What shoulde I say, but it hath been sayde? what war∣ning shoulde I giue, but it hath byn giuen? I haue byn carefull for my people, that they shoulde repent and turne to me, that all Israel shoulde be saued. If they perish, I am free from their destruction they perishe in their owne wilfulnesse, they haue none ex∣cuse.</HI></P>
<P>Now touching an Allegory, whereof we
<PB REF="7"/>
are at this present to say: God opened his minde sometimes not by wordes, but by some notable kinde of deede: and the people heard GOD speak vnto them not with their eares, but with their eyes. The people of Israel as they were passing through the wildernesse, lacked water to drinke, and were like to perishe, there stood a mighty great Rocke of harde stone whiche Moses smote with his rodde, it opened and yel∣ded out a great streame of water, the whole people dranke of it, and was refreshed: the same people being likewise in the same wildernesse vtterly voyde of bread, and all other substenance, was like to famish, God sent them <HI>Manna</HI> from heauen aboue, they gathered it, they ground it, and they ate of it: it was sweet and delicate, and full of comfort.</P>
<P>This was an Allegorie, that is to say, a se∣cret and mysticall kinde of vtterance. For, by this <HI>Manna,</HI> and by this Rocke, the people was ledde to vnderstand and thinke on that bread and that water that should come from heauen. <HI>Saint Paul</HI> saith, <HI>the Rocke was Christ:</HI> his side was clouen, his blood issued out, it is a water sprin∣ging <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Cor. 10.</NOTE> vp into euerlasting life, we drink of it, and liue for euer.</P>
<P>So likewise that <HI>Manna</HI> was the bodie of Christ, the people did eate of it, and liued by it. Christ had not yet taken vppon him a natu∣rall
<PB REF="7"/>
bodye, yet they did eate his bodie: he had not yet shedde his blood, yet they dranke his blood. <HI>Saint Paule</HI> saith, <HI>all did eate the same</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10.</NOTE> <HI>spirituall meate,</HI> that is, the body of Christ: <HI>and all did drinke of the same spirituall drinke:</HI> that is, the blood of Christ, and that as verily and as truely as we doe nowe, and who so euer then did so eate Christ, liued for euer, not because the rocke was turned into his flesh, or the water into his blood: it was an Allegory, as al other Sacramentes be: the people hereby was taught to consider of other things.</P>
<P>When the people was strong with Ser∣pentes in the wildernesse, and were swollen, and heaued vp, and perished in the wildernesse without hope of cure, <HI>Moses</HI> erected vp a bra∣sen serpent vppon a pole: the people beheld it, their anguish abated, their swelling slaked, and they were healed: Christ was this serpent, he was lifted vpon the crosse, who so trusteth in him shal neuer be ashamed.</P>
<P>In certaine of their sacrifices they had a Lambe, they stickte him, they killed him, and made sacrifice of him, this Lambe was Christ the Sonne of GOD, he was killed, stickt, and made a sweete smelling Sacrifice for our sinnes. Of him sayeth God himselfe, <HI>This is</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3.</NOTE> <HI>my beloued Sonne in whom I am well plea∣sed.</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>
Of him saith <HI>Iohn, Beholde the Lambe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon. 1.</NOTE> <HI>of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.</HI> Of him <HI>Saint Peter</HI> speaketh, <HI>among men there is none other name giuen vnder</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes. 4.</NOTE> <HI>heauen, whereby we must be saued.</HI> In his righteousnesse onely we are receyued as righ∣teous, his blood clenseth vs from all sinne, there is no other sacrifice wherewith we may be reconciled to GOD our heauenly Father: all these were Allegories, that is to say, cer∣taine resemblaunces and significations of se∣crete matters. That striking of the Rocke, that feeding vppon <HI>Manna,</HI> that lifting vp of the Serpent, that killing of the Lambe, were cer∣tayne mysticall kinds of speaking. And let no man thinke these things are impertinent or frō the purpose: they are incident vnto the matter, and grow necessarily of the things we haue to speake of.</P>
<P>When <HI>Iosuah</HI> that noble and worthy Cap∣tayne by Gods speciall conducte had past tho∣row the water of Iorden, and taken possessi∣on in the Lande of Canaan, a Land flowing with mylke and hony, there to plant the people of Israel according to the promises that GOD had made them: the Citizens of <HI>Hiericho</HI> that stoode in the frontiers of the Countrey, rampyred their wall, and placed their artille∣rie, and appoynted them selues to resist him,
<PB REF="8"/>
and to withstand his force. To assault this City, Iosuah practised a straunge kynd of bat∣tery. He commaunded that the Arke of Gods Maiesty shoulde be carried reuerently about the Walles seuen dayes together, and that the whole hoste in armour shoulde goe before it: that after them shoulde followe seuen Priestes with seuen Trumpets: that all the rest of the people shoulde followe after the Arke: and that thus they should doe euery day once. The seuenth day he encreased their labour, and bade them to goe about seuen times in like or∣der. The people within laughed them to scorne to see their folly. At the seuenth and last turne, Iosuah commaunded them all to make a showte. Straight way after so long silence, they lifted vp their voyces, and showted with a greate showte, so many hundred thousands of men, women, and children: the Trumpets blewe in euery corner, the whole Heauen and earth was ful of their noyse, and the Wall fell downe flat.</P>
<P>Here let vs consider, and glorifie the pow∣er of God: there was neyther mine, nor ramme, nor other engine, nor warlike force, nor world∣ly pollicy practised: onely at this roare and sounde of Trumpets, and voyces of men, the rampyers were broken, the walles fell downe,
<PB REF="9"/>
and sunke, and were made euen with the grounde: the Souldiers went ouer and slewe without mercy, man, woman, and child, and cat∣tell, and whatsoeuer creature they found before them, they fired the citie, and consumed it, and burnt it to ashes.</P>
<P>Then Ioshua sware at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lorde, whosoeuer hence foorth shall take in hande to restore this City of <HI>Hiericho:</HI> let him lay the foundation thereof in the death of his eldest sonne, and in the death of his youngest childe let him close vp and finishe the gates: let him neuer more re∣ioyce in the fruite of his bodie, but let him liue as a manne accursed in the middes of the peo∣ple: let his name and memorie, and all his po∣sterity perish with him: this was the tenure of Ioshuas curse.</P>
<P>Sixe hundred yeeres after in the time of the wicked King <HI>Achab,</HI> one <HI>Hiel</HI> (hauing <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 16.</NOTE> no regarde to this curse) set vppon to restore <HI>Hiericho:</HI> and it came to passe euen as it was foresaide by Ioshua, Gods curse fell vppon him, he buryed his eldest sonne, bee huryed his youngest sonne, hee was left without comforte euen as a man that the Lorde had cursed: for Gods will was that <HI>Hie∣richo:</HI> shoulde lye waste, and desolate for euer,
<PB REF="9"/>
as an euerlasting remembraunce of his wrath, that all people should feare to withstand his wil. This is the plaine story onely, according to the letter.</P>
<P>But as touching the <HI>Allegorie,</HI> or the mat∣ter which therein lyeth couered, it hath a farre deeper meaning. This <HI>Hiericho</HI> whereof the story speaketh, was a citie in <HI>Canaan,</HI> in a lowe, sowre, barren ground, in the middest of a rotten <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. King. 2</NOTE> and pestilent water, by reason whereof before the same water was cured by the Prophet <HI>Eli∣zeus,</HI> the men that dranke thereof died of sundry diseases, &amp; the women also became vnfruitfull. This citie withstoode the people of God, and la∣boured to keepe them from their inheritaunce that God had giuen them.</P>
<P>That <HI>Hiericho</HI> of whiche we haue nowe to consider, is a spirituall power of darknesse, that resteth onely in flesh, and in worldy promi∣ses, that withstandeth Gods people, and exal∣teth itselfe against God. For euen in this life, as there is a <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> so is there a <HI>Hiericho:</HI> as truth hath her house, so is there also a house wherein falshoode and errour dwelleth. As there is a glory of the light, so is there a power of darkenesse. This <HI>Hiericho</HI> of falsehood and darkenesse God ouerthroweth when it seemeth good in his sight, with the breath of his mouth, and with the blast of his holy woorde hee doeth
<PB REF="10"/>
ouerthrow it, and whosoeuer wil seek to restore it, shalbe accursed.</P>
<P>Three things therfore I haue thought good by Gods sufferance to treate of.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 First, how high this <HI>Hiericho</HI> is built, and how strongly it is fenced, and yet how easily it is ouerthrowen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 How vainely, and how miserably they loose their labour, that seeke by any meanes to restore it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 What good remedies may be deuised, that this <HI>Hiericho</HI> be not restored againe.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Whatsoeuer my simple learning or vtterāce shalbe, yet I doubt not, but the very bare consi∣deration hereof, of it selfe, vnto the godly must needs be comfortable.</P>
<P><HI>They that goe down to the sea in shippes, and occupy by the great waters, they see the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 107.</NOTE> <HI>works of the lord, &amp; his wōders in the deep.</HI> For God is maruelous in the surges and tem∣pestes of the Sea: he is marueilous in the firma∣ment of Heauen: but much more marueilous is he in the surges and stormy Tempestes of his Church. Here may we beholde the worke of his hands. This is y<SUP>e</SUP> shop of his power, of his wis∣dome, of his light, and truth, and righteousnesse, and patience, and mercy. Here may we see the children of light, and the children of darknesse: the vessels of honour, and the vessels of shame:
<PB REF="10"/>
the assaultes of falshood, and the glory and victory of truth. Here shall we see how God leadeth euen into Hell, and yet bringeth safely backe: how he killeth, and yet reuiueth: howe he refuseth the full, and feedeth the hungrye: howe he is the ruine of many, and the resurrec∣tion of many. Here may we see the wonder∣full wayes, and the vnsearcheable iudgments of GOD. It is a place full of terrour, and a place full of all comfort. In respect hereof the Prophete <HI>Dauid</HI> saith, <HI>O Lorde, our Lorde, how wonderful is thy name in al the world?</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 8.</NOTE> Againe he saith, <HI>One thing haue I desired of the Lord, that I wil require, that I may dwel</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 27.</NOTE> <HI>in the house of the Lorde al the daies of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lorde, and to visit his Temple.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hiericho</HI> was a mighty strong Towne, wel manned, well victualed, well walled, well fenced: and in affiaunce thereof it withstood the whole power of Gods army. <HI>Iosuah</HI> (notwith∣standing he had great force of armed men) du∣ring the assaulte, suffered no man to vse his weapon: hee willed them all to walke quietly, and silent, without doyng violence: his strength was not in the number and courage of men, but onely in the Arke, that is in the presence and po∣wer of God.</P>
<P>Thus it fareth oftentimes in spirituall war∣fares:

falsehood is armed, &amp; truth goeth naked: falsehood maketh outcries, and trueth saith title: falsehood is bold, and truth is outfaced. Blinde∣nesse of it selfe naturally is hardy and ventrous: and falsehoode is wyly and shifting. When the high priestes &amp; captaines of the temple, &amp; the el∣vers were come to lay handes on Christ, he said vnto them, <HI>This is your very houre, and the power of darknesse.</HI> Their hearts were darke∣ned, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 22.</NOTE> their eyes were blynded, they saw not their wayes, they knewe not their daungers, they would not vnderstand, they woulde not be taught: malice and frowardnes had made them blinde, therefore the feare of God was not be∣fore their eyes. Herein stoode their power, ther∣fore they were bolde, and sayde, <HI>Let vs breake their bandes, and cast their cordes from vs,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 2.</NOTE> Therefore they sayde, <HI>Wee will not haue this man to raigne ouer vs.</HI> Therefore they sayde, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 19.</NOTE> <HI>The word that thou hast spoken to vs in the name of the Lorde, we will not heare it of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierc. 44.</NOTE> <HI>thee.</HI> Thus cryed they, because of the blindnes which was in them, and because of the folly of their hearts.</P>
<P>Yet is there no souldier so stoute in defence of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> as hee that thinketh his cause is good, and that his doing pleaseth God well, and therefore is moued thereto in conscience. None so desperate and wilfull for the falsehoode and

darkenes of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> as such who haue zeale without knowledge, as are blinde, and followe their blinde guides: who when they slaunder, or persecute, or kill others for righteousnesse sake, thinke they make a sacrifice vnto God, and that GOD is highly pleased with their doing.

Al those plagues, &amp; vtter destruction came vpon <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> because shee knew not the time of her visitation, euen the daye of Gods mercy, as they were foretolde by the Prophet <HI>Ieremy, Behold, that which I haue built will</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 45.</NOTE> <HI>I destroy, &amp; that which I haue planted wyll I pluck vp, euen this whole lande.</HI> So dooth god plague one sinne with another, &amp; letteth thē whiche are filthy grow in filthinesse, because of the hardenes of their hart which can not repent: wherby they heape vnto themselues vengeance against the day of the Lords wrath: such are not worthy to see <HI>Hierusalem:</HI> therefore are they left to perish in <HI>Hiericho.</HI></P>
<P>As for the eloquence and deceitefull persua∣sion of the learned, I wyll say nothing. Not∣withstanding it hath bene, and is so vsed to the
<PB REF="19"/>
restoringe of <HI>Hierico,</HI> that a blinde man may perceiue it, and all the world may rue it. One saide sometimes, that were the matter neuer so false, hee woulde prooue it by eloquence to bee true. Another sayde, the sunne and moone stand stil, and the earth goeth about. Another sayde, that snow is blacke, and that hee was able well to proue it, and there were many whiche belee∣ued them. Such were they of whom it is writ∣ten in the Prophet <HI>Esay, that spake good of euill, &amp; euil of good: which put darkenes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 5.</NOTE> <HI>for light, and light for darkenesse, and put bitter for sweete, and sweet for sowre.</HI> So they mocked the eyes of the ignoraunt, and ab∣used the giftes of God. <HI>Thy wysedome and thy knowledge</HI> (saith the Prophet) <HI>they haue</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 47.</NOTE> <HI>caused thee to rebel, and thou hast sayde in thine heart, I am, and none els: thou art wearyed in the multitude of thy Counsels: let now the Astrologers, the Starre gasers, and Prognosticatours stande vp, and saue thee from these thinges that shall come vp∣on thee.</HI></P>
<P>We may answere such learned disputers, as <HI>Dauid</HI> answered the proud <HI>Goliah, thou com mest to me with a sword, and with a speare,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 17.</NOTE> <HI>and with a shield:</HI> that is, with great eloquence &amp; shew of learning: <HI>but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of hostes, the god of the
<PB REF="19"/>
host of Israel, whom thou hast rayled vpon.</HI> By the Prophet Ieremie thus sayeth the Lord. <HI>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdome,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 9.</NOTE> <HI>nor the strong mā glorie in his strength, nei¦ther the rich mā glorie in his riches: but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he vn∣derstandeth and knoweth me.</HI> Agayne, <HI>it is written</HI> (sayth the Apostle) <HI>I wyll destroy the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1.</NOTE> <HI>wisedome of the wise, &amp; will cast away the vnderstanding of the prudent.</HI> And <HI>Eliphaz</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob. 5.</NOTE> saith, <HI>He taketh the wise in their craftines, &amp; the counsel of the wicked is made foolish:</HI> he wyl open their errors, he will bewray theyr craftinesse, he will ouerthrow the cunning de∣uises of their wit: these helps shal not suffice to builde vp cursed <HI>Hiericho.</HI></P>
<P>Now to speak of the third help, of the power of Princes, whom the wicked builders of this spirituall <HI>Hiericho</HI> haue in all ages deceiued. The authoritie of a prince is great, he is the ser∣uant of God, he carieth y<SUP>e</SUP> sword for God to take vengeance on hym that dooth euill. <HI>Salomon</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 16.</NOTE> saith, <HI>The wrath of a king is as messēgers of death.</HI> Unto thē these builders haue recourse, &amp; accuse the seruants of the lord, which haue wai∣ted vpon Iosuah, and haue done y<SUP>e</SUP> Lords wyll, vpon this wilfull and rebellious citie.</P>
<P>The Heathen and Infidels vsed this helpe against the Christians, they accused thē before
<PB REF="20"/>
Kinges that they were wicked, that they wor∣shipped strange gods, that they liued in adulte∣rie, and incest, that they killed theyr Children, and dyd feede vpon mans flesh. Before them they charged the Christians with diuisions and schismes, sayinge, You Christians agree not a∣mong your selues, you haue so many sects, and one sect is at defiance with another, and con∣demneth one another: therefore your religion is not true, it is not of God. Since the time wee forsooke our Gods, these and these euils are come vpon vs. They charged Christians that they were stirrers vp of rebellion, and that they disquieted the mindes of the people. Let these Christians, said they, be cast to the Iyons. Such complayntes were brought before Kinges and Princes againste the Christians of the Primi∣tiue Church, and these false charges haue bene thoughte true: therefore were there sharpe lawes made agaynst them. It was comaunded, that no man shoulde speake in the Name of Christ, and who did not obey this, shoulde dye the death.</P>
<P>Who is able to expresse the miseries, whiche followed in the execution of those Lawes? There was no sworde nor weapen, no racke nor torment, no fire, nor water, but they were prepared for, and stayned with Christian blood, Souldiers were kept in whole garisons: prin∣ces
<PB REF="20"/>
made Leagues, kepte Councils, deuised new and cruell lawes, vsed conspiracies, prac∣tised al kindes of strange and terrible deathes for the defence of <HI>Hiericho:</HI> they kylled Chri∣stians by thousandes <HI>Maximianus</HI> burnt in one Temple twentie thousande, assembled to∣gether to celebrate the memorie of the Natiui∣ty of Christ. <HI>Dioclesian</HI> made proclamation for the ouerthrowinge of the Christian Churches throughout all the <HI>Romane</HI> Empyre: hee cau∣sed the Bookes of holy Scripture to bee bur∣ned in the open Market place: and displaced with great ignomie suche Christians as were Magistrates, and all other that bare any office. These thought, that heerby the gospel of Christ should be abolished, and quite ouerthrowne.</P>
<P>But the Lorde, which was mightie to saue <HI>Daniel</HI> in the middes of the lyons, and <HI>Ionas</HI> in the whales bellye, and his three seruantes in the flaming fire, and <HI>Israel</HI> in the redde Seat whose eyes are ouer the righteous, and whiche is nigh vnto all that call vpon hym: was also able to make his owne cause good, to giue courage to his Seruantes, &amp; tremblinge and anguish of minde to their enemies. For the more his seruannts were deminished, the more they encreased: and the more tyrants preuailed, the more they were weakened. He that should die was bold and carelesse: he that shoulde kyl,
<PB REF="21"/>
was fearefully amazed: the tormentor mour∣ned, the condemned reioyced: the dead had the glorie, the Tyrantes the shame: their sacrifices decayed, their Temples were forsaken, theyr Goddes laught to scorne, their Priestes were wood, and lacked their large offringes: the Lorde did let the curse fall vpon them, whiche he made by his seruant Ioshuah, and whiche shall come vpon al those that wyll seeke to raise vp <HI>Hiericho.</HI></P>
<P>To rehearse the examples of Gods myghtye hande, and to declare what hee hath done in all ages, to shew foorth his power, no tongue is a∣ble: yet it is expedient to giue foorth one or two examples thereof. <HI>Licinius</HI> an vngodly Emperour, after hee had extended his force a∣gainst the Christians to suppresse them, and gaue greatest shew of his fauour to such about him, as could best deuise new and straunge tor∣ments, felt y<SUP>e</SUP> plagues of god, was sundry times vanquished by <HI>Constantinus,</HI> to whom he yeel∣ded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tripart. hist. lib. 1. cap. 8. Carion. li. 3</NOTE> himself, and led a priuate life in <HI>Thessalia,</HI> vntill at length hee which had beene before the enemy vnto al learning, was slayne by his own souldiers. The palme of the hande whiche <HI>Bal∣thazar</HI> saw write vpon the plaster of the wall, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 5.</NOTE> did more amaze him, his countenance was more changed, and his thoughts more troubled ther∣with, then if he dad bene assaulted with the force
<PB REF="21"/>
of a hundred thousand men.</P>
<P>King <HI>Pharaoh</HI> first saide to the messengers of God <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron,</HI> I know not the Lord, I care not for him. But when he felt the smart of Gods hand, he cried out vnto them. <HI>The Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wic∣ked:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 9.</NOTE> <HI>pray ye vnto the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunders, &amp; haile, and I wil let you goe, and you shal ta∣rie no longer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Antiochus</HI> placed idols in the Temple of God, and blasphemed his name, and brought <HI>Ie∣rusalem</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Mach. 1.</NOTE> into bondage, he burnt the bookes of the Lawe in the fire, and cut them in pieces, that so, the name of God might no more be remem∣bred: but when the tormentes which God cast vpon him began to vexe him, then hee began to leaue off his great pride and selfe wil: when he was plagued, &amp; came to the knowledge of him selfe with the scourge of God, when he himselfe might not abide his owne stinke, he said, <HI>It is meet to be subiect vnto God, &amp; that a man</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Mach. 9.</NOTE> <HI>which is mortal, should not thinke himselfe equall to God through pride.</HI> Then he pray∣ed to the Lord, then he deliuered the Iewes, thē he would restore the temple, then he would also become a Iew himselfe, and goe through al the world, and preach the power of God. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. lib. 8: c. 10. &amp; 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Maximianus practising the like attemptes,
<PB REF="22"/>
was likewise striken: his fleshe was eaten with lice, his body rotted in wardly, hee was not able to abyde the smel of himselfe, Then hee confes∣sed his errour, found his guilte, called in his pro∣clamation, stayed his sword, and (albeit it were against his mynd) commaunded that the Chri∣stians shoulde haue their Bookes, and vse their Churches, and heare the Scriptures and call vppon the name of Christ, as they had done be∣fore.</P>
<P><HI>Iuliane</HI> of all other began most politiquely and subtlely, and therefore most mightely to set vp <HI>Hiericho.</HI> He gaue commandement that no Christian mans childe should goe to schoole, de∣uising thereby to keepe them rude and barba∣rous, that no Christian shoulde beare office, or liue in any manner authoritye, thereby to make them vyle: that they should neuer be Captaynes or souldiers, that so they might be kept in weak∣nes, he remoued the Christians out of his court. He opened againe the temple of the Heathen, &amp; did erecte Idolles in them, and the more to giue credit and countenaunce to the matter, he him¦selfe being the Emperour, tooke vpon him the office of a Bishop, and did offer sacrifice: many of the nobles, &amp; many of y<SUP>e</SUP> people, applied them¦selues to followe this example, and did the like. He licēced the Iewes to returne home again, &amp; to build vp <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> he allowed them mony,
<PB REF="22"/>
he gaue them liberties, and all this onely in the despite of Christ: onelye to discredite and deface the glory of the sonne of God. Hereby the Here∣tikes vpbrayded and defied Christ: the faithfull were dismayed, and the church of GOD was brought to great confusion.</P>
<P>But now let vs enter into the sanctuary of the Lordes counsels, and behold the later end of these doinges. The Iewes fell to woorke, layd their foundation, prouided al thinges needefull, and began to buylde: sodainely brake out an earthquake, and ouerthrew their worke: lighte∣ninges fel from heauen and burnt their tooles in their handes, and their coates on their backs. The print that the lightning made in their gar∣ments was a crosse, in token that they were the enemies of the crosse of Christe. Then was the name of Christ more glorious, and his Gospell more beautiful then before.</P>
<P><HI>Iulian</HI> tooke his iourney into <HI>Persia,</HI> and had made great threates, y<SUP>t</SUP> at his returne hee would consume the name of Christians, roote, out the name of the <HI>Galilaeans,</HI> and not leaue one Chri∣stian aliue, and would set vp the Image of <HI>Ve∣nus</HI> in all his Churches. But, being in the field, he was sodainely striken in the breast with an arrow from heauen: he pulled it out, the wound was deadly, he cursed Christ, hee tooke of the blood into his hande, threwe it vp into the ayre,
<PB REF="23"/>
and thus cried, <HI>Vicisti Galilaee, O thou Christ of Galilee, thou hast conquered.</HI> Thus sodē∣ly the tyrant was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aine, his attempts were ac∣cursed, his frame of <HI>Hiericho</HI> would not stand. The faithful Christians were set at liberty, they went to their Churches, they gaue God y<SUP>•</SUP> glory, they made triumphs &amp; were ioyful. Thus God looketh vpon his faithful: such is the power and readines of his hand.</P>
<P>The diuel himselfe confessed, that when any Christian was present, his mouth was musted, he could not speake, he could doe nothing. The like might be said of <HI>Nero, Caligula, Maximi∣nus,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. tripar. li. 7. cap. 39.</NOTE> <HI>Dioclesian, Valerian,</HI> &amp; others: they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ōquered <HI>Fraunce, Spain, Germany, Englād, Hungarie, Dalmatia, Arabia, India, Persia,</HI> &amp; <HI>Scithia:</HI> they had the world at commandement, yet a few poore Christians, artificers, women, &amp; maydens, ignorant and vnlearned people, they coulde neuer conquer. <HI>Nero</HI> had crucified <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI> and beheaded <HI>Paule</HI> that preached the Gos∣pel, but the Gospel whiche they preached, they could not behead, they could not crucifie. <HI>Nero, Caligula, Commodus,</HI> and sundry others like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yrants were slain. <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> as it is thought, was striken mad, made vnable to rule, and ther∣fore left the Empire. <HI>Valerian</HI> was taken in the field by <HI>Sapores</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> and tyed in a chaine, and being the Emperour of the worlde,
<PB REF="23"/>
was made to lie downe on all foure, that <HI>Sapo∣res</HI> might set his feete on his shoulders, and so get to horsebacke.</P>
<P>Al this notwithstanding the Gospel of Christ grewe stil and went forwarde. Suche successe shal they haue, that take in hand to builde <HI>Hie∣richo.</HI> The Lorde wil smyte his enemies vp∣on the cheeke bone, he will breake the teeth of the wicked. Well may they barke, they shal not byte. God knoweth the way of the righte∣ous, and the way of the wicked shal perish. God resisteth the proude, but giueth grace to the low∣ly. <HI>Yet a little while</HI> (saith <HI>Dauid) &amp; the wic∣ked shall not appeare, and thou shalt looke</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 37.</NOTE> <HI>after his place, and hee shall not be found:</HI> The remembraunce of him shall perish. Euery plant which our heauenly father hath not plan∣ted, shalbe rooted out. Put not your trust then in princes, nor in the sonnes of men, which cannot saue themselues: their breath departeth, and they returne to their earth. It is God that is king of kings, which loueth the righteous, &amp; ouerthro∣weth the way of the wicked. <HI>All flesh is grasse,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 40.</NOTE> <HI>and al the grace thereof is as the floure of the field, the grasse withereth, the floure fa∣deth: but the word of our God shall stande for euer.</HI></P>
<P>Was God able in those daies to auenge the cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elty of Tyrantes, to withstand the proud, to
<PB REF="24"/>
defend the humble and lowlie, &amp; shal we thinke that his hande is shortened? great is our God, &amp; his power is wonderfull, and there is no ende of his iudgements. O what leagues, and confede∣racies, what practises, &amp; pollicies haue we seene defeyted? what aboundaunce of blood hath been shed by sword, and by fire? the workers thereof are gone, the end of many of them was horrible, yet the Gospel continueth, and encreaseth in all places. <HI>Aeneas Siluius,</HI> who was afterward Pope, and called <HI>Pius</HI> the seconde, sheweth in his storie of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> what great preparation was made to mainteyne the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. Bohemi∣ca. cap. 48.</NOTE> and to destroy al those which professed the Gos∣pel, whom they called <HI>Hussites</HI> and <HI>Calixtians,</HI> because they defended the receyuing of the cup, as well as of the bread in the Lordes Supper. Two Cardinals, the one of them Cardinall <HI>Beauford,</HI> an English man, &amp; Bishop of <HI>Win,</HI> the other <HI>Iulianus,</HI> were sent into Germany to leauy power: at whose intreaty the Emperour and States appoynted three armies of men to fulfill the Popes purpose. But (saith the story) <HI>Non visum hostem fugerunt, They fled before they did see the enimie.</HI> And againe the secōd time, <HI>Priusquam hostis vllus daretur in cospectu, foedis sima caepta fuga, They fledde away with shame, before any enimy came to fight.</HI> here of one of the Cardinals <HI>Iulianus,</HI> writeth thus
<PB REF="24"/>
to <HI>Eugenius</HI> the fourth, <HI>Nonne videbitur hic di∣gitus Dei? Ecce, exercitus armatorum toties fu∣git à facie eorum, &amp; nunc similiter Ecclesia vni∣uersalis fugit: ecce, nec armis, nec literis vinci pos¦s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Videbitur miraculum Dei euideter, demon∣strans illos ver a sentire, nos falsa. Is not the po∣wer of God here to be seene? our armies of souldiers haue fled before thē many times, and now the vuiuersal Church fleeth. They cannot be ouercome, neither by weapons, nor by learning. This must needs appeare a miracle wrought by God, to declare that their opinion is true, and ours false.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we see how vainly, and miserably they encumber themselues which take vpon them to restore <HI>Hiericho.</HI> God withstandeth them &amp; de∣feateth their purpose, as wee may see this day. Let vs therfore reioyce in God, and let vs saye with the people of Israel, <HI>I will sing vnto the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Lord; for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and him that rode vpon him hath he ouerthrowen in the sea.</HI></P>
<P>It is not enough, that wee looke backe and gaze at this decayed citie of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> and be∣holde the rampiers loosed, the walles throwen downe, the houses burned, and the people there∣of slayne. God can giue peace, God can with∣drawe it: we haue seene the iudgements of the Lord vpon them, wee haue seene the turning of
<PB REF="25"/>
the Lords hand towards vs. That thing whiche hath bin done, may be done again. The Arke of God was taken by the <HI>Philistims,</HI> and God suf∣fered his temple to be spoyled: not that he was offended with the Arke, or with the temple, but for the vnworthines of the people. He neuer for∣saketh, but he is first forsaken. As he saith, <HI>See∣ing ye haue forsaken mee, I wil also forsake you.</HI> God himself telleth vs by the prophet <HI>Iere∣mie,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Esd. 1.</NOTE> as you heard before. <HI>That which I haue built wil I destroy, &amp; that which I haue plan∣ted wil I plucke vp.</HI> When Christ rebuked the vnthankfulnes of the Iewes, he said vnto them, <HI>The kingdom of God shalbe taken frō you, and shalbe giuen to a nation, whiche shall</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 21</NOTE> <HI>bring forth the fruites thereof.</HI> And agayne, <HI>The children of the kingdom shalbe cast out into vtter darknes, for many are called, but</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 20.</NOTE> <HI>fewe are chosen.</HI> It behoueth vs not therfore, ouermuch to glory in victory. It is fickle, and casuall, and may be lost. Let vs humble our selues vnder the mighty hande of God, let vs acknowledge the woonderfull woorke that he hath wrought in our dayes, and praye him to continue the good thinge hee hath begunne a∣mong vs. In him we haue our lyuing, our mo∣uing, and our being. We are nothing but claye before him, that he which reioyceth, may reioyce in the Lorde.
<PB REF="25"/>
Now it remaineth we consider what wholsome remedies may be deuised, that <HI>Hiericho</HI> be neuer againe restored. Here of I wil say somewhat, the time so requireth. Heere might wee marke the practises and policies of noble cōquerors, what wayes they take to keepe themselues in safety, and their conquered subiectes from rebellion, Some when they had gotten a citie, thought it enough to ouerthrow the walles therof, Some razed al the castels, &amp; threw down al the holdes. Others haue built strong places, and Towers, and furnished them with munition to bridle the people. Others haue spoyled them, and kept thē poore. Others haue vnarmed them, &amp; kept them from all weapon. Others to withdrawe them from vnquiet fancies, haue set them to Plough the ground, and to other bodily labour. Others haue cut off their captaines, and al such as might seem able to leade the people, and to moue rebel∣lion. Some haue killed their male children. Some dissolued the old Lawes, and gaue them new. Others haue forbidden banquets &amp; feasts, and al other conuenticles or assēblies, to make them strange one to another. Others haue pur∣posely sowed and mainteined factions, &amp; set city against citie, surname against surname, blood a∣gainst blood, that no man might safely trust a∣nother. Some haue deuised othes and bands, of conscience: some haue deuised lawes martial, &amp;
<PB REF="26"/>
other crueltie: some haue transported, and ca∣ried away the whole people, man, woman, and child: as <HI>Nabuchodonozor</HI> did the Iewes in∣to <HI>Babilō,</HI> &amp; put others in their place. By these, and such other like wayes, as much as wisedom and pollicie could deuise, they thought to keepe countries and nations in obedience.</P>
<P>But, as touching our spiritual <HI>Hiericho, Io∣suah</HI> suffered nothing to stand, he burnt hou∣ses, and palaces, and killed man, woman, &amp; child, &amp; cattel without mercy, altogether. For so God had giuen him in commandement, and so is it of∣ten written of him, that where the Lord gaue a∣ny people into his hands, he left nothing remay∣ning, no, were it neuer so little. Of this pollicie <HI>Moses</HI> speaketh. <HI>If you wil not driue out the inhabitāts of the land before you, thē those</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 33.</NOTE> <HI>which ye let remaine of them, shalbe pricks in your eies, &amp; thornes in your sides, &amp; shall vexe you in the land wherein ye dwell.</HI> De∣stroy not some onely, to leaue some: you shall leaue nothing, no not a little. If you doe leaue, you breake the commandement of God.</P>
<P>In religion, no part is to be called little. A heare is but little, yet it hath a shadowe. In the bodie, a little disquiet is oftentimes cause of death. The <HI>Ciniphes</HI> were but litle, yet are thei reckoned among the great plagues of God.</P>
<P><HI>Metellus</HI> a noble man of Rome, by receiuing
<PB REF="26"/>
a haere in his milke, was choked with it, &amp; died thereof. Some thinges are smal and do no hurt: some things though they be smal, do great hurt. Therefore doth God straightly charge his peo∣ple to keepe the law saying, <HI>Thou shalte not</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosue. 1. &amp; 6. Deut. 15. &amp; 28. 1. Co. 5.</NOTE> <HI>turne awaye from it, neither to the right hand nor to the left.</HI> And <HI>S. Paul</HI> saith, <HI>A litle leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe.</HI></P>
<P>I speake not this, because I thinke nothing at al may be left to any special purpose. For euē in <HI>Hiericho,</HI> where was made a general destruc∣tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosue 6.</NOTE> God himselfe commanded, that all siluer &amp; gold, and vessels of brasse &amp; iron should be saued, &amp; not saued only, but be brought into the Lords treasurie. How be it, the things that may bee re∣serued, must not be dust, or chaffe, or hay, or stub∣ble: but gold, and siluer, &amp; yron, and brasse, I meane, they may not be things meet to furnish and mainteine superstition, but such thinges as be strong, and may serue either directly to serue God, or els for comelines and good order. Such thinges may be reserued. notwithstanding they came out of the spoyle of <HI>Hiericho.</HI></P>
<P>Now to stay the restoring of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> ma∣ny good wayes may be deuised. For our consi∣deration at this present, and because the time is farre spent, I will name onely foure vnto you. The first, <HI>Maintenaunce of schooles &amp; lear∣ning.</HI> Secondly, vnderstanding of the cause:
<PB REF="27"/>
that is, that euery man may consider, what hee hath left, &amp; what he hath receyued: out of what darknes, into what light he is come. Thirdly, kindnes towards God, &amp; thākfulnes. Fourthly the discipline of y<SUP>e</SUP> church. With these 4. by gods grace, we may keepe <HI>Hiericho</HI> from restoring. Of eche of these a few words, &amp; so I wil end.</P>
<P>That learning and knowledge, is able to hinder the builders of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> it is so playne that it needeth no speech. In the time of <HI>Moses</HI> Law, <HI>Aaron</HI> the great Bishop and high Priest, had writtē in a tablet before his brest, <HI>doctrine,</HI> and <HI>truth:</HI> not onely learning, but also trueth: wherby was meant, that neither might be with∣out other. For, as learning is daungerous and hurtfull without religion, so is religion vnable to defend it selfe, and to conuince the gaine say∣ers, without learning.</P>
<P>For this cause, the Heathen, when they erec∣ted temples in the honour of their gods, did also builde libraries, that is, places to keepe bookes: that by such meanes, their priests might grow in knowledge, &amp; be better able to perswade others to their religion. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth of the <HI>Smyrni∣ans,</HI> that they builte a temple in the honour of <HI>Homer,</HI> and ioyned therto a library. <HI>Augustus</HI> the Emperour, built a temple and also a library in the honour of <HI>Apollo, Traianus</HI> in like maner built a library and called it <HI>Ulpia</HI> after his own

In al times y<SUP>t</SUP> kings &amp; princes which did set forth religion, were also builders of schooles and col∣leges, &amp; auācers of learning. The people of Is∣rael were neuer in better state (as <HI>P.

The same <HI>Phagius</HI> reporteth of <HI>Hie∣rusalem,</HI> that there were in it more then 4. hun∣dred common schooles &amp; <HI>Synagogues,</HI> in which y<SUP>•</SUP> Law of God was taught. The Patriarke <HI>Ia∣cob</HI> was called <HI>Minister domus doctrinae, a Mi∣nister of the house of learning,</HI> because he ap∣plied himself to the knowledge of y<SUP>e</SUP> law of god, &amp; to godlines. The Prophets of God had their schooles, to breed vp vnder them such as might after their death draw y<SUP>e</SUP> people from idolatrye,
<PB REF="28"/>
and resist the false Prophets. They which were so taught by them, were called <HI>Filij Propheta∣rum, The sonnes of the Prophetes, Samuel</HI> taught in such sort at <HI>Rama. Elias</HI> and <HI>Elizeus</HI> the Prophetes, in suche sorte, taught the Law of God besides <HI>Hiericho. Saint Iohn</HI> the Euan∣gelist, taught at <HI>Ephesus:</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> reporteth out of <HI>Philo,</HI> that <HI>S. Marke</HI> had at <HI>Alexandria</HI> sundrye schollers, which gaue themselues to reading and reasoning, and expounding of the Scriptures. Others did the like at <HI>Antioche,</HI> and at other places. Out of such schooles it plea∣sed God to take many excellent men, and place them in his Church, as <HI>Origen, Tertullian, Cy∣prian, Lactantius, Arnobius, Basilius, Nazian∣zenus, Chrysostomus, Hieronimus, Ambrosius, Augustinus,</HI> who were brought vp in al kind of learning, and became shyning starres, &amp; bright lightes in the house of God, notable defenders of religion, ouerthrowers of idols, and confoun∣ders of Heretikes. Christiā princes herein haue witnessed their zeale, in setting foorth the glory of God.

<P><HI>Alexander Seuerus</HI> so highly esteemed that famous and notable Lawyer <HI>Vlpian,</HI> that when <NOTE PLACE="marg">Charion. Chronic. lib. lib. 3. Alex.

<P>As also for the contrarie, such as haue practi∣sed cruelty vpon learned men, and haue hated knowledge, are worthely discommended in the stories of all ages. I told you before of that wic∣ked <HI>Apostata Iulian,</HI> how he forbad y<SUP>t</SUP> Christiās should bring vp their childrē in learning. Such an enemie to knowledge was also <HI>Licinius</HI> the Emperour, who called learning the poison and ouerthrowe of common weales. The like is re∣ported of <HI>Caligula, Caracalla</HI> and <HI>Domitianus,</HI> that either they vtterly hated all maner of lear∣ning, or had some special malice against y<SUP>e</SUP> wri∣tinges of some one notable man, and therefore sought to destroy them. Such was the policy of
<PB REF="29"/>
Satan, so thought he to get the vpper hande, &amp; to restore againe his wicked <HI>Hiericho.</HI></P>
<P>And were these the practises of Heathē prin∣ces onely? May not we remember the like at∣tempts wrought in our daies. Who wil cal to minde the time that is not farre past, shal finde that this ignoraunt <HI>Hiericho</HI> had many friends, who by all meanes drew men from knowledge: they gaue liberty rather to doe any thing, thē to seeke vnderstanding, and yet suffered rather the vse and reading of fabulous &amp; vncleane writers, then of the holy scriptures, and bookes whiche carried fruitful instruction.</P>
<P>Good letters, and studie to increase know∣ledge, are not to be neglected. Such as presume of Gods spirit ouer boldely, that without their endeuour to vse the wholesome meanes which he hath left vnto his Church they shal and do by special inspiration vnderstand his wil, do tempt God. The prophet <HI>Dauid</HI> prayed for the presēce of Gods spirit, but to the purpose he might take profite &amp; fruit of his reading in the law of God. Therfore he saith, <HI>Open mine eies, that I may see the wonders of thy law: and giue me vn∣derstanding,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119.</NOTE> <HI>and I wil keepe thy law.</HI> And a∣gaine, <HI>encline mine heart vnto thy testimo∣nies.

<PB REF="29"/>
saith, <HI>Now we haue receiued, not the spirit of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

Ioh.</NOTE> spirit. <HI>Augustin</HI> saith wel, <HI>Non verbis hominis fit vt intelligatur verbum Dei: facit Deus vt in∣telligatis. The wordes of man doe not cause that Gods worde is vnderstoode: God gi∣ueth the vnderstanding thereof.</HI> And <HI>Chry∣sostome</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In 3. cap. 2. ad Corint.</NOTE> vpon these wordes of the <HI>Apostle, Suche trust haue we through christ to god, not that we are sufficient of our selues to thinke any thing, as of our selues, but our sufficiēcy is of god,</HI> saith: <HI>Hoc est, non it a dicebam fiduciam ha∣bemus, vt id partim sit nostrum, partim sit dei∣sed totū illi tribuo, acceptum{que} fero:</HI> that is, <HI>I did not so say we haue trust, y<SUP>t</SUP> this work is partly ours, &amp; partly gods: but I allow it, &amp; yeelde
<PB REF="30"/>
it wholly vnto God.</HI> The consideration hereof putteth vs in mind to ioyne humble and heartye prayer to our diligent reading &amp; hearing, y<SUP>t</SUP> God wil giue vs vnderstanding and knowledge.</P>
<P>Nowe to conclude this first remedy, where∣by <HI>Hiericho</HI> may bee kept from buylding: we may say that of the vse of good learning, which <HI>S: Augustine</HI> speaketh against those that charge <NOTE PLACE="marg">De ciuitat. dei. lib. 16. cap. 2.</NOTE> the scriptures with vnnecessary speeches: <HI>Solo vomere terra proscinditur: sed vt hoc fieri possit, etiam caetera aratri membra sunt necessaria. The share onelie renteth the grounde, but to helpe this woorke, the other partes of the plough are also needeful.</HI> We say, eloquence and other liberal artes are to be likened to that part of the Carpenters wimble, which turneth about, goeth rounde, and by litle and litle draw∣eth in the iron, or steele bit. The wooden handle entreth not into the wood, but wreatheth in the pearser: so do these artes, if they be rightly vsed, further the vnderstanding of the worde of God. This vse <HI>Lactantins</HI> seemed to seeke when he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 3. instit. cap. 1.</NOTE> said, <HI>Vellem mihi dari eloquentiam, vel quia ma∣gis credant homines ornatae veritati, vel vt ipsi suis armis vincantur, I would gladly haue the gift of eloquence, either because mē might giue better credit to the trueth, when it is beautified: or els because the heathen may the sooner bee ouercome with their owne weapons.</HI> And in another place, he sheweth that
<PB REF="30"/>
this eloquence must serue and wayte vpon the wisedome of God: <HI>Circumliniatur poculum coe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lact. instit. lib. 5. cap. 1</NOTE> <HI>lestis sapientiae melle, vt intelligamus nō hominē loqui, sed Deum. Let the cup (of your speech) be seasoned with</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>hony of Gods wisdome, that we may know it is god that speaketh, and not man.</HI> Where this is not done but men giue them selues rather to bee curious in hea∣ring eloquence and pleasantnes of speach, then desirous to learne the trueth, the woorde of God becommeth vnfruitfull, as it is to bee fea∣red in many, that they litle account of the Gos∣pell of Christ, but seeke to please their itchinge eares with fantasies of men. <HI>Augustine</HI> sayeth <NOTE PLACE="marg">De doctrin. chr. lib 4. cap. 11.</NOTE> to such. <HI>Bonorum ingeniorum insignis est indoles, in verbis verum amare, non verba: Quid enim prodest clauis aurea, si aperire quod volumus non potest? aut quid obest lignaea, si hoc potest? quando nihil aliud quaerimus nisi vt pateat quod clausum est. Such as be of good dispositiō seek not af∣ter words but after y<SUP>e</SUP> trueth: For what auai∣leth a key of gold, if it cānot open y<SUP>t</SUP> we wold haue opened?</HI> &amp; <HI>what hurteth a key of wood if it can opē? seing we desire no other thing but that it be opened vnto vs, which is shut.</HI></P>
<P>The seconde let or stay that <HI>Hiericho</HI> bee not restored, is, that the people may bee instructed, why it was ouerthrowne, &amp; why God hath cur∣sed thē that shal seeke to restore it. This know∣ledge is a singular gift of god. When the Lord
<PB REF="31"/>
declared his fauour towardes <HI>Israel</HI> amonge o∣ther his speciall mercies hee spake in this sort: <HI>This shall be the couenant that I wil make with the house of Isarel: after those dayes, I</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 31.</NOTE> <HI>will put my Lawe in their inwarde partes: and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shal bee my people: and they shal teach no more euery mā his neighbour, and euery man his brother, sayinge, Know the Lord: for they shall all know mee, from the leaste of them to the greatest of them, sayeth the Lorde.</HI> And agayne our Sauiour sayeth out of the prophet <HI>Esay. They shall all be taught of God.</HI> And in the seuententh of <HI>Saint Iohn,</HI> he sayeth, <HI>This is life eternall, that</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon. 6. Iohn. 17.</NOTE> <HI>they knowe thee to be the onely very God, and whome thou hast sent Iesus Christ.</HI> To this ende, and for this cause, <HI>He gaue some to bee Apostles, and some Prophetes, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 4.</NOTE> <HI>some Euangelistes, and some Pastours, and teachers, for the gathering together of the Saints, for the worke of the ministerie, and for the edificatiō of the body of Christ: that we hencefoorth bee no more children wa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ering and caried about with euery wind of doctrine, by the deceit of men, &amp; with craf∣tines, whereby they lay waite to deceiue.</HI> Therefore doeth <HI>S. Peter</HI> cal vpon them that are of the church of god, in all places, that they shew foorth the mercies of God, that they witnesse
<PB REF="31"/>
vnto all the world, what the Lord hath done for them, in filling them with all spirituall know∣ledge and vnderstanding: <HI>Be readie alwayes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">I. Pet. 3.</NOTE> <HI>to giue an answer to euerie man that asketh you a reason of the hope y<SUP>t</SUP> is in you.</HI> There fore doeth God giue charge to his people the children of Israel, to heare his Lawe and keepe his commaundements, not as an ordinance that shoulde stande good but for a season, whiche shoulde bee kepte onely by them: but also re∣quireth that they teache the same to their po∣steritie, that so his great blessinges may neuer bee forgotten. For thus hee sayeth. <HI>These wordes which I commande thee this day,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 9.</NOTE> <HI>shall bee in thine heart, and thou shalt re∣hearce them continually vnto thy children, and shalt talke of them, when thou taryest in thine house, and as thou walkest by the way, and when thou lyest downe, and when thou risest vp.</HI> Thus doeth God, by promise that hee wyll giue the Spirite of knowledge and of vnderstanding vnto his people, and by raysing vp labourers whom he hath sent foorth into his viniarde, Prophetes, Apostles, Euan∣gelistes, and pastours, and teachers, and by his earnest commaundement that we giue eare to his woorde, and speake of his wonderfull kindenesse shewed vnto vs and our forefathers, make it appeare howe needefull a thinge it is, that we knowe his will. Without this know∣ledge
<PB REF="32"/>
we cannot loue hym as our father we can not feare him as our Lorde.</P>
<P>But, when wee see the miserable blindenesse and ignoraunce in all places abroade, what hope may wee haue to see <HI>Hiericho</HI> suppressed and quite ouerthrowne? It cannot be but great inconueniences shall followe in the Churche of God, as confusion of order, and dissolution of life, to the indangering of the state, vnlesse by godly care of the Magistrates, some helpe be prouided. This care must shewe it selfe in remouinge blinde watchmen whiche haue no knowledge, who are but dumme dogges that can not barke, who lye and sleepe, and de∣light in sleeping. These greedye Dogges can neuer haue enough (sayeth the Prophet <HI>Esaye,) Non residence</HI> and absence from their cure, is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 56.</NOTE> a fault that woulde bee amended in the Sheap∣heardes of the Lordes flocke. Though they be neuer so able to instructe, and therefore wor∣thie to haue the roumes in the Churche: yet, if they haue not a desire to do good, if they feede not Christes sheepe, if they be strangers to the people of their charge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if they bee not at hande to giue their flockes their bread in due season, what let may there bee, but that ignorance and blindenesse shall growe and encrease in the people?</P>
<P>Another fault no lesse hurtfull to the Church of God, is the sufferinge of pluralities, when
<PB REF="32"/>
one man taketh the profite of two or more be∣nefices, whiche is not worthye of one. These <HI>Non residents</HI> and pluralitie men teache not, they knowe not, nor care for the People of their charge: they haue brought this confusion and shame into the house of God. They are blinde guides, they are the darkenesse of the world. Against those whiche are suche, GOD sheweth his heauy displeasure: <HI>My Sheep,</HI> say∣eth <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 34.</NOTE> he <HI>wandred through all the mountaines, and vpon euerie high hill▪ yea, my flocke was scattered through al the earth, and none dyd seeke or searche after them.</HI> And againe, <HI>Neither did my shepheards seeke my shepe,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>but the shephardes fedde themselues, and not my sheepe.</HI> And by the Prophet <HI>Ieremie</HI> he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierm. 2.</NOTE> saith: <HI>They that shoulde minister the law, knew me not.</HI> And againe, <HI>The Pastours are</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 10.</NOTE> <HI>become Beastes, and haue not soughte the Lorde: therefore haue they none vnder∣standinge: and all the flockes of their pa∣stures are scattered.</HI> These either bee a rem∣nant of the wicked Inhabitantes of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> that resist the passage of Gods people towardes the land of promise: or suche as haue forgotten the commaundement of the Lorde, and haue gi∣uen themselues to doe the sinnes of the people, whom the Lord gaue ouer vnto them. These be they that seeke the restoringe of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> &amp; the ouerthrow of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> therefore the curse of
<PB REF="33"/>
God wyll fall vppon them: the blood of Gods people shall be required at their handes, because they bring the abhomination of desolation into the holy place: because they suffer Christes flocke to perishe for lacke of knowledge, and to be caryed away after euery wynde of false doctrine. God graunt al such, that they may see with their eyes, and vnderstande in their heartes, and knowe the gratious goodnesse of the Lorde, that the people bee not through their negligence like Horse and Mule: but that they may descerne betweene darkenesse and lighte, and betweene <HI>Hiericho</HI> and <HI>Hierusa∣lem:</HI> that they may bee able to giue a reason of the faith whiche is in them and that they may teache the same vnto their Children. So shall we be builte vpon a rocke, so shall we stande as firme as mount <HI>Sion,</HI> so shall wee neuer be con∣founded.</P>
<P>The thirde meanes to stay the buyldynge of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> is to bee thankefull for the bene∣fites whiche God hath bestowed vpon vs: and in suche sorte to leade our life, that it may ap∣peare wee bee his seruants. To this ende God hath giuen his holye worde: and to this ende hath he left his holy sacraments, that we should be put in minde of his kindenes, and not become vnmindefull or vnthankefull, and so receiue his grace in vayne,</P>
<P>But, you wil say, What thanks shall I giue?
<PB REF="33"/>
Some leade me one way, and some another: some saye heare is Christe, some saye there is Christe: I know not nor wherefore, nor howe to yeelde thankes, Hereto a short answere can not suffice, and a long woulde be tedious. Let vs call to remembrance the Lesson that was giuen vs in this place on Sunday last: Let vs search the scriptures. <HI>Esay</HI> the Prophet saith, <HI>To the Law, and to the testimonie, if they</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 8.</NOTE> <HI>spake not according to this worde, it is be∣cause there is no light in them. Chrisostome</HI> saith, <HI>Nullo modo cognoscitur quae sit vera Ec∣clesia</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 49 in opere imper∣fecto.</NOTE> <HI>Christi, nisi tantummodo per Scripturas. By no meanes may it by knowne, whiche is the true Church of Christ, but onely by the Scriptures.</HI> Without them our faith is no faith without the helpe of them wee cannot knowe Christ from Antichriste, wee cannot know the Church of Christ from the Sinagogue of Sa∣than. Hereby let vs learne to knowe <HI>Hierusa∣lem,</HI> hereby let vs learne to knowe <HI>Hiericho.</HI> Certainely if the woorde of GOD, and the breathe of his mouthe bee not able to shewe this: tradition and custome shall be much lesse able.</P>
<P>It is a good thinge to bee thankefull, and to prayse the Name of the most high: the seruants of God finde cause of thankfulnes in considera∣tion of the great &amp; wonderful mercies continu∣ally powred vpō them. <HI>Moses</HI> comanded <HI>Nisan</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12.</NOTE>
<PB REF="34"/>
to bee the firste moneth in the yeere, because God had deliuered Israell from the hande of <HI>Pharao</HI> in that month. In like sort <HI>Mardocheus the Iewe, and Esther the Queene, sent letters</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ester. 9.</NOTE> <HI>vnto al the Iewes that were through all the prouinces of the king Assuerus both nere &amp; farre, enioying them that they shoulde kepe the fourteenth day of the month Adir with ioy and feasting,</HI> for that vppon that daye God had deliuered them from the hande of <HI>Haman:</HI> and that they woulde not fayle to obserue the fame euery yeare.</P>
<P>Upon this day, euen vpon this day, I say, the xvii. of this moneth, God sent his handemaide, and deliuered vs. Let vs be kinde and thankfull vnto God for so great blessing. I say not, let vs make it the first day of the yeere. Yet this I say, let vs haue it in remembrance, let vs singe with the prophet, <HI>When the Lord brought againe</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>captiuitie of Sion, we were like them that dreme, thē was our mouth filled with laugh∣ter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psa. 126.</NOTE> <HI>and our tongue with ioy. The Lord hath done great things for vs, wherof we reioyce.</HI> Let no man be offended herewith, it is onely a remembrance of the mercy of God, it behoueth vs to remember it, it is good to speake of it. For if we haue eyes to see, and neglect not our owne saluation, wee haue nowe much greater cause to reioyce then <HI>Dauid</HI> had, because the things which are this daye restored vnto vs by
<PB REF="34"/>
the goodnesse of our God, are farre greater and worthyer then those, which <HI>Dauid</HI> and the peo∣ple of Israell receiued in their deliuerance out of the capitiuitie of <HI>Babylon.</HI> For by howe much the heauens are greater then the earthe, and God is more excellent then a creature: so much doeth the knowledge of God, and his true worshippe, passe all worldly blessinge, and all other felicitie that can bee deuised vnder the Sunne. For what knoweth hee, which know∣eth not God? Or what worshippeth he, whiche worshippeth not God? Hee that worshippeth not God, hath not the comforte of GOD: but hee that hath God, and knoweth God, and serueth God, hath a sure helpe and defence in all assayes. Let vs therefore bee glad and re∣ioyce, let vs witnesse our ioye, and singe vn∣to the Lorde a new songe. Let vs kindle in our heartes the fire of the loue of God, and of our neighbour, and let the flame thereof breake out to the glory of God. Let vs decke the Al∣tars of our heartes with the florishing branches of vertue, and good woorkes: let vs sacrifice and kill our lustes and affections. In this ma∣ner if wee shewe our thankefulnesse towardes GOD, wee shall hinder the wicked purpose of thē that wish the restoring of <HI>Hiericho,</HI> we shal see the lande of Gods promise, and enter into his rest.</P>
<P><PB REF="35"/>
The fourth stay to hinder this buyldinge is discipline, whiche is so needefull, that neyther without it shall yee be able throughly to discom∣fort those that seeke to build vp <HI>Iericho</HI> againe, nor your selues happely and prosperously to goe on forward in setting foorth the glory and maie∣stie of our God, and to passe safely to the coun∣trie promised. It is as the sinewes of the church to strengthen it, and to ioyne and knit the parts thereof together. But, because the time is passed and this matter weightie, and worthy of larger discourse, I wyll leaue it to your godly consi∣derations, and for some other time.</P>
<P>And thou, O mercifull father, rise vp we be∣seeche thee, to iudge thine owne cause, stablishe the thinge thou hast begonne in vs, guide our feete in the way of peace, giue force vnto thy worde, blesse thine inheritance, blow downe the walles of <HI>Hiericho:</HI> so shal <HI>Hierusalem</HI> prospet, and her walles be made strong: so shall the daye starre lighten our hartes: so shall <HI>Israel</HI> re∣ioyce, and all the people truly know thee, and prayse thy name for euer.</P>

But as they were aboute the building, vpon occasion of cōplaint of their ene∣mies, the whole worke was stayed. At y<SUP>•</SUP> length, after 70. yeeres, God remembred his promise and mercy, and stirred vp the heart of king <HI>Da∣rius</HI> king of <HI>Persia,</HI> who had then conquered the Chaldees, to lycence the Iewes to depart home agayne into their countrie, and to reedifie theyr Citie and Temple. This king <HI>Darius</HI> (as the <HI>Rabbines,</HI> or Doctors of the Iewes, and most parte of learned men coniecture) was sonne vn∣to the king <HI>Assuerus,</HI> begotten of the good La∣die Queene <HI>Hester,</HI> which Ladie <HI>Hester</HI> he ma∣ried after he had imbased, &amp; diuorced from hym the prowd and stubborne Queene <HI>Vasthi.</HI> This was Gods marueylous prouidence, by that meanes twice to deliuer his people. Fyrst, by the good Lady <HI>Hester,</HI> from the tyranny of <HI>Hamā,</HI> as it appeareth by the storye: and after, by her <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ester. 3.</NOTE> child <HI>Darius</HI> cleerely to delyuer them, and to discharge them out of their enemies handes for euer.</P>
<P>The Iewes, notwithstanding they had so gra∣cious a graunt of their king, yet many of them
<PB REF="36"/>
would not returne home, but made their aboade euen there among their enemies in <HI>Babylon:</HI> and the most part of them that were returned, fell to building of their owne houses, and left the house of God vnbuilded: so soone they had forgotten Gods mercy towardes them. In the time of their trouble, they cryed out, If I shrinke from God, I pray God shrinke from me. But beinge restored home and at libertie, they sayde, as the Prophet heere reporteth, <HI>Nondum uenit tempus, &amp;c. The time is not yet come, that the Lords house should be builded.</HI></P>
<P>They saw they had many enemies on eue∣rie side, the matter it selfe was marueylous weightie, and to their iudgementes almost im∣possible. They had begunne before vnder kynge <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and because, the matter was then dashe, and their enimies preuayled against them, they were vtterly discouraged and cast into dispayre. Wherefore god spake to them by the Prophet <HI>Aggaeus, Is it time for your selues to dwel in your seeled houses, and this house lye wast?</HI> Haue you found le asure to set vp &amp; furnish your owne house, &amp; can you neglect the restoring of my house? My house (I say) in which my Lawe hath bene read and preached to you, where your Fathers haue made mee sacrifices, towardes which house you turned your faces, whensoeuer you prayed vnto me in <HI>Babylon,</HI> and were heard? Therfore sayth the Lord. <HI>Ye haue sowen much
<PB REF="37"/>
&amp; bring in litle: ye eate, but yet haue not y∣nough: ye looked for much, &amp; loe, it came to litle: and when you brought it home, I dyd blow it out.</HI> You set your ioye vppon vaine things, and the same shal deceiue you.</P>
<P>This place of the Prophet <HI>Aggaeus,</HI> I haue thought good to apply to the present state of our time. For, as then the citie of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> was miserably rased, and the Temple of god burnt downe by heathens: euen so hath it fared in time lately past with the Churche of Christe, here a∣monge vs. And, as then God mollified &amp; softe∣ned the heart of the king <HI>Darius</HI> for the deliuery of his people, euen so of his great mercie hath he nowe stirred vp a most noble &amp; vertuous Ladie our soueraigne Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> for the same purpose. And, as then there were many that set light by Gods benefites, and thought it meete y∣nough for him to waite vpon their leisure: euen so, I pray God, the same securitie be not founde in vs at this time. I pray God there be none of vs that make light of Gods grace, and say in our heartes, <HI>Nondum venit tempus, &amp;c. The time is not yet come, that the Lords house should be builded.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 Wherfore, first I wil proue (by Gods grace) that our Churche hath bene ouergrowne with errours and abuses, as then the temple of <HI>Hieru∣salem</HI> was defaced by the Caldees.</P>
<P N="2">2 Secondly, I will shewe what thinges they

<P N="3">3 Last of all, after what sorte this Churche ought to be builded, and so I wyl leaue you to God.</P>

<P>Touching the first parte, I shall not neede many wordes, for God hath in our dayes suffi∣ciently reuealed, and we haue seene the state of the Church in time past. And indeed, the errors &amp; abuses haue bene so grosse, that who so cānot see them with his eyes, yet may feele and grope them with his fingers. Yet, because I knowe some are not throughly perswaded heerein, but thinke that the church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath euermore bene pure and without spot: and, some others in their writinges call it the rule of the trueth, that whatsoeuer that Church sayth, whatsouer it be, must needs be true: as <HI>Siluester</HI> sayth, it is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Siluest. Prierias con∣tra Lutherum</NOTE> <HI>Infallibilis regula, a rule that neuer decei∣ueth.</HI> Some set it aboue the word of god, as the same <HI>Syluester. A doctrina Ecclesiae Romanae &amp; Romani Pontificis sacra scriptura robur trahit &amp; authoritatē. The holy scripture taketh force &amp; authority of</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>doctrin of the church &amp; Bishop of Rome.</HI> And as <HI>Cusanus: Sequuntur</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. 2. ad Bohemos.</NOTE> <HI>Scripturae Ecclesiā, &amp; non è conuerso.

It is not

possible he should fall into heresies whiche foloweth the church of Rome:</HI> some others sai y<SUP>t</SUP> if christ &amp; his Apostles were aliue, they were not able to rule the church in better sort, then it is now ruled, by the Pope and his Cardinalles. Thus some schoole doctors haue written, I am able to aleadge mine authors. Therfore I must of force stād vpō this matter a litle not because I think it needfull, but y<SUP>•</SUP> al men may be satisfied,</P>
<P>First, Christ our sauiour, as he foreshewed the prosperous course of the gospell, y<SUP>t</SUP> it should bee preached throughout y<SUP>e</SUP> world, &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> the gates of hel should not be able to withstand it: so he &amp; his Apostles forwarned also the ruine &amp; decay of y<SUP>•</SUP> Church: &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> in so many places, and in so plaine wordes, that no man can doubt of it, or deny it.</P>
<P>For, Christ alleadging the prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> sayth, that abomination should sitte in the holy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 24.</NOTE> place, and, that there shoulde be such confusion and disorder, that if it were possible the very e∣lect should be peruerted. He sayth, that when he shall come to iudge, there shal scarsely be found <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 18.</NOTE> faith in the world. <HI>Paul</HI> likewise sayth, that the man of sinne, that is such a one as in all thinges <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Thes. 2.</NOTE> should be contrary to Christe, and is called An¦tichrist, shoulde sitte in the temple of God, and beare hymselfe as if hee were God in deede. <HI>Daniel</HI> sayth, <HI>The trueth shal be cast downe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 8.</NOTE> <HI>to the grounde.</HI> And to <HI>Timothie Paul</HI> sayeth, <HI>In the latter times some shall depart frō the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Tim. 4.</NOTE>
<PB REF="38"/>
faith, <HI>and shall giue heede to spirites of er∣ror, &amp; doctrins of deuils. <HI>S. Peter</HI></HI> saith, <HI>Ther</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Pet. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>shal be false teachers among you.</HI></P>
<P>And, where saith Christ, (I beseech you consi∣der) where saith Christ, this horrible desolation should be? among y<SUP>•</SUP> turks or Iewes? no, but in the holy place. Wher shal y<SUP>e</SUP> son of man scarse∣ly finde faith? wher shall the very elect stande in doubt what they may beleeue? amōg y<SUP>e</SUP> heathēs or infidels? No, but in the church, Wher saith <HI>S. Peter</HI> shalbe y<SUP>e</SUP> masters of lies, wher saith <HI>Dani∣el,</HI> shall the truth be troden downe? where sayth <HI>S. Paul,</HI> shal y<SUP>e</SUP> mā of sin perch, &amp; settel, &amp; behaue himself as if he were very god? among the hea∣then? No, no good brethren, but <HI>in templo Dei, In the Temple of God,</HI> in the very Church a∣mong thē that should beare the name of Christ. But, forasmuch as it cannot be doubted among christian men, that Christ &amp; his Apostles appoin¦ted y<SUP>e</SUP> church in their time in such sort, as no bet∣ter could be deuised, let vs cōpare the church of late time to y<SUP>t</SUP> original, as the vse is, in trying of mesures, where, in tryal whether is true or fals, ye haue euermore recourse to the standard. For if ther be any falt, whatsoeuer it be, the standerd wil bewray it. This order Christ himselfe vsed with the priests &amp; Pharises, saying, <HI>Domus mea</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat, 21.</NOTE> <HI>domus orationis vocabitur, My house shall bee caled the house of praier.</HI> But you haue gone frō the paterne or original, &amp; you haue made it a
<PB REF="39"/>
harbour for theeues. And whereas the conten∣tion stoode vpon diuorse, Christ called them to y<SUP>e</SUP> first original, <HI>A principio non fuit sic, From the beginning it was not so: they twayne shall be one flesh.</HI> And <HI>S. Paul,</HI> when the holy my∣sterie <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat 19.</NOTE> of the Lordes Supper was abused, called thē home to the first institutiō, <HI>I haue receiued of the Lorde, that which I also haue deliue∣red vnto you.</HI> By this standerde Christ repro∣ued <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11.</NOTE> the <HI>Sadduces: Erratis, nescientes Scripturas, You erre, not knowing the Scriptures.</HI> And <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 2.</NOTE> by the same hee confuted the Deuil, when hee came to tempt him, <HI>Soriptum est, It is written.</HI> This standerd shall bee able to warrant vs, if <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 4.</NOTE> we can saye truely, <HI>Scriptum est.</HI> For as the learned father <HI>Irenaeus</HI> sayth, <HI>Scriptura est ba∣sis &amp; fundamentum fidei nostrae: The Scrip∣ture</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iren. lib. 3. cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>is the pillar &amp; foundation of our faith.</HI> It is rashnesse to beleeue without the warrant or direction of the Scriptures. It is not de∣uotion, nor catholique faithe, but foolish rash∣nesse.</P>
<P>Now howe many wayes, and in howe ma∣ny poyntes the Church of late dayes hath dis∣sented from the Churche of Christe and of the Apostles (which no doubt was the Catholique Church) it were almost an infinite worke to recken vp. For they disagree in so many things y<SUP>t</SUP> in maner they agree in nothinge. Notwith∣standing, I wil lay out one or two things before
<PB REF="39"/>
you, and by them your wisedomes shall ghesse the rest.</P>
<P>Christ gaue the Sacrament of his body and blood to bee frequented in the Congregation, that all shoulde bee partakers thereof, in re∣membrance of his death, and sayde, <HI>Hoc facite</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 22.</NOTE> <HI>in meam commemorationem, Do yee this in re∣membrance of mee.</HI> Thus Christ hymself or∣dayned and commanded: thus the Apostles, and the catholique fathers in the primatiue Church vsed it: and there can no commandement, nor ex¦ample, be shewed forth to the contrary. Yet our later fathers, agaynst Christ, agaynst the Apo∣stles, against the primitiue church, haue thought it sufficient, that one priest alone should commu∣nicate for all the rest.</P>
<P>Christ deliuered the holy Communion vn∣der both kindes, and so was it vsed in the Pri∣mitiue Church, and in the times of the doctors, <HI>Chrysostome, Ambrose, Gregorie, Augustine,</HI> and <HI>Hierome.</HI> But our fathers in the Councill holden at <HI>Constance</HI> of late yeares, haue gone from the originall, and haue decreed against Christ himselfe, against his Apostles, and Doc∣tours: that, to minister the Communion to a lay man vnder both kinds, is an open heresie. Alas, (good brethren) I beseeche you consider by the way, in what state was the Church of Christe then, when Christes owne institution, and the Apostles doctrine was called heresie?</P>
<P><PB REF="40"/>
Christ, his Apostles, &amp; the catholque fathers vsed their praiers in a common tongue, that the people might perceiue what was saide in the Church, &amp; say Amen. But, how neere our later fathers come to that originall, it needeth no re∣hearsal. For you haue heard it taught you as a necessary doctrine, that your prayers should be in the Latine tongue, although you did not vn∣derstand what ye prayed for: and that kinde of prayer hath bene called deuotion.</P>
<P>God left order to his Church, <HI>Non facies tibi sculptile, thou shalt not make thee any grauē image.</HI> From Christs time for the space of 500 yeres, there was no allowance of images in the Catholique Church▪ but our later fathers cānot take it for a Church, vnlesse it be decked, &amp; set about with images.</P>
<P>The Apostles were maried (as <HI>Ignatius</HI> and <HI>Ambrose</HI> witnes) &amp; so were others y<SUP>e</SUP> ministers of the Church after them, as it is wel knowne, for 1000. yeres after Christ. To hold good this originall, there haue bene certayne Canons set downe, <HI>Si quis do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uerit sacerdotem sub obtentu</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Distine. 28. Si quis.</NOTE> <HI>religionis, propriā vxorem cōtemnere, anathema sit. If any man teach</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>a priest, for color of re¦ligiō should contēn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his wife, let him be ac∣cursed.</HI> And y<SUP>e</SUP> general coūcel holden at <HI>Gāgra,</HI> as it is set downe also by Gratian, <HI>If any put differēce betwene the priest that is maryed,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dist. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. Si quis discernit</NOTE> <HI>by reson of his mariage, that he should not
<PB REF="40"/>
offer, &amp; for that cause cōmeth not to his of∣fring, he is accursed:</HI> yet pope <HI>Hildebrand</HI> one of the later fathers, decreed &amp; cōmanded, that no man should heare such priests Masse, that had a wife: but caused their tenth to bee burnt, their prayers &amp; blessings to be holden as curses, and the sacrament which they had consecrate, to be spit at, and troden vnder mens feete.</P>
<P>You wyll saye, These be but smal matters, and may be borne withal, for decencie and good order. But you shal vnderstand, that the canons of the Apostles, and diuers of the first Bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> and other holy Fathers required, that all such as were present at the ministration of the Communion, shoulde also bee patakers of the Sacrament: &amp; accounted worthy to be put out af the Church, whosoeuer would not com∣municate with the Minister. And <HI>Chrisostome</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Homil. 3. ad Eph.</NOTE> calleth such a one impudent &amp; malepert. <HI>Quis∣quis mysteriorum cōsors nonest, &amp;c. whosoeuer</HI> saith he, <HI>doth not communicate, &amp; standeth by, he is shameles &amp; malepert.</HI> Cōmuniō vn∣der <NOTE PLACE="marg">De consecrat. dist. 2. canone Comperimus</NOTE> one kinde, is no smal matter, but such a mat∣ter, &amp; of such weight, that <HI>Gelasius</HI> calleth it opē sacrilege, to minister y<SUP>e</SUP> sacrament in one kinde.</P>
<P>Common prayer in a straunge tongue, is such a matter, that it taketh away the very vse of cōmon prayer. For the people (as <HI>Paul</HI> saith) cannot say, Amen, nor be edified, nor giue God thankes. And the Emperour <HI>Iustinian</HI> in a law
<PB REF="41"/>
that he maketh, touching the publike prayers of the Church, saith thus, <HI>we cōmand al Bishops &amp; priests to minister the holy oblatiō, &amp; the prayer at</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>holy Baptism, not vnder silēce, but with such voice as may bee hard of the faithful people: to the intent that the harts of the hearers may be stirred vp to more de¦uotion, &amp;c. And let the holy priests vnder∣stand, that if thei neglect ani of these things, they shal make answer therfore at the dread¦ful iudgment of the great God, &amp; our saui∣our Iesus Christ. And yet neuerthelesse, wee our selues vnderstanding the same wyll not passe it ouer, nor leaue it vnpunished.</HI></P>
<P>To haue images in the church of God, is no smal matter, It is forbidden by a general coun∣cel called <HI>Eliberinū: &amp; Epiphanius a catholique</HI> father calleth it abhomination.</P>
<P>The violent inforcing of sole life, is such a matter, that <HI>S. Paul</HI> calleth it <HI>doctrinā daemoni∣orum, <HI>the doctrin of deuils.</HI></HI> And <HI>Daniel</HI> saith, it is one of the marks of Antichrist: <HI>Neither shal he regard the desires of women.</HI> Which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 11.</NOTE> place <HI>S. Hierome</HI> ex{per}oundeth, <HI>Ideo Antichristus simulat cactitatem, vt plurimos decipiat. <HI>There∣fore dooth Antichrist faine or pretend cha∣stity, that he may deceiue many.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Thus farre they disagree from the originall of Gods worde. But they vse commonly to saye, the Churche was then in her minoritie
<PB REF="41"/>
and infancie: afterwarde, she was better infor∣med. So when Christ, and the Apostles, and the Doctours please them, they shall rule the matters, they shall be holy Doctours, and holy Fathers: if not, they shall not bee paternes to folow, but children &amp; infants. They vse them as marchants vse their counters: for that counter, which now standeth for a pound, anon after shal be remoued and made a simple halfpenny. Yet notwithstanding, they cry Fathers, Doctours, Church: and yet indeede do al things contrary to the Church of Christe, contrary to the Doc∣tours, and fathers of the Church.</P>
<P>Two principall thinges there be, that seeme to beare vp the whole brunt of the religion, that hath bene in the world of late time: the one is the Masse, and thinges thereunto belonginge: the other is the authoritie of the Pope. These two I wyll breefely compare to the first origi∣nall: onely running ouer certaine special bran∣ches of them both, in as few wordes as I can deuise.</P>
<P>And as touching the Masse, if there be any man here that hath any good opinion of it, and is also learned and able to iudge, let him thinke with himselfe, what Doctour or father in the Primitiue Churche euer vsed, or taught vs to vse a priuate Masse: what Doctour or Father euer hearde of 10. 20. or 30. Masses in one Church said at one time: what Father or doctor
<PB REF="42"/>
euer taught the Priest to communicate for o∣ther? <HI>Chrisostome</HI> noteth, it is an errour to say. y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Sacramēts receiued of one, may do good</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 40 in 1. ad Cor.</NOTE> <HI>to others, that receiue them not.</HI> What Fa∣ther or Doctor euer taught, that <HI>hoc facite,</HI> was <HI>hoc sacrificate?</HI> What Doctour or Father euer taught vs, that the bread is transubstātiate into Christes bodie? I assure you that worde was neuer hearde of, vntill nowe within litle more then 300. yeeres vnder <HI>Innocentius</HI> the thirde. What Father or Doctor taught vs, that there remaine <HI>accidentiasine subiecto?</HI> that Christes body is in a C. thousand places at once, that the Priest should holde the bread ouer his head, and turne his backe to the people? that the Sacra∣ment shoulde bee hanged vp in a canopie for the people to adore? What father euer taught vs, that their communion bread shoulde be rounde, because the earth is rounde? That the Priest shoulde kisse the Altar, because Iudas kissed Christ? that he should wash his fingers, because Pilate washed his handes? That hee shoulde knocke his breast, iu token of the theeues repen∣tance vpon the Crosse? Those thinges haue bene written by <HI>Durande, Bona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enture,</HI> and <HI>In∣nocentius,</HI> and others like of late time: but the Fathers in the Primitiue Church neuer heard of them.</P>
<P>Yet some men of late time haue beaten into your heades, y<SUP>•</SUP> these &amp; many other like thinges
<PB REF="42"/>
haue come by succession, euen frō the primatiue Churche, and from the Apostles. But so the coniurers and Sorcerers saye, that their books of coniuration and sorcerie came from <HI>Moses,</HI> from <HI>Enoch,</HI> and from <HI>Abel. Plutarche</HI> writeth, that <HI>Theseus, Romulus, Hercules,</HI> and other like Princely gentlemen, indeede were Bastardes, and were be gotten of fathers of very lowe de∣gree: but after they came into honour, and estimation, the people (because they knew not whose sōnes they were) thought they had come from heauen, and therfore they called them the sonnes of the gods.</P>
<P>Euen so, these thinges that I haue here re∣ported, nowithstandynge in deede they are base borne, yet because they haue stollen into the Churche and haue bene had in honour, some men haue taughte you, they haue come euen from heauen, and therefore they haue fathered them vpon Christe, and his Apostles. But in the meane season, they haue not dealte iustlye with you, but haue done wronge both to Christ and to his Apostles. <HI>Hierome writinge</HI> vpon <HI>Aggeus,</HI> sayeth: <HI>Quae absque authoritate &amp; testimoniis Scripturarum quasi traditione A∣postolica</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierom. in 1. Agge.</NOTE> <HI>sponte reperiunt at qué confingunt, percutit gladius Dei: <HI>The Sworde of God stricketh those thinges which men fynde out and deuise of them selues without the</HI>
<PB REF="43"/>
authoritie &amp; testimonies of the scriptures, and deliuer foorthe, as if they came by the tradition of the Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, what Catholique Father taught vs, that the Pope is the head of the Church, aboue kings, aboue Councils, aboue the word of god, greater and of more authoritie then the Apo∣stles: that he cannot erre: that the whole world is his diocesse: that he may not be iudged what soeuer hee doe, although he drawe a thousande soules downe into hell: that he is neyther man nor God, but a mixture medled together of God and man: Al these thinges, our later Fa∣thers haue written of the Pope: and yet I leaue a hundred things vntouched. Thus farre haue they gone from their originall and paterne.</P>
<P>But what greater disorver can there bee in the Church of God, then when Antichrist shall come and sit in the place of God? There is an olde fable of Antichrist, that when he commeth, he would turne trees vpside downe, and do such like wonders. But the markes whereby Anti∣christ shall be knowne indeede, are otherwise set downe in the holy Scriptures. In his com∣ming, <HI>abhomination shall stand in the holy place, and trueth shall be throwne downe in the earth.</HI></P>
<P>I knowe many men are offended to heare the Pope pointed out for Antichrist, and thinke it an vncharitable kinde of doctrine: therefore
<PB REF="43"/>
I refraine to vse any such names, and only wyl reporte to you of other, by what tokens Anti∣christ, when he commeth, may bee knowne <HI>Gre∣gorie,</HI> as it were in the spirit of prophesie, wri∣ting <NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. lib. 4. epist. 38.</NOTE> against <HI>Iohn</HI> bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> saith <HI>Rex superbiae propè est, &amp; (quod dici nefas est) Sa, cerdotum est praeparatus exercitus: The king of pride is at hand, &amp; (which is vnlawful to be said) an army of priests is prepared,</HI> By these tokens, saith <HI>Gregorie,</HI> you may know him: hee shalbe the prince of pride, and he shal haue an ar∣my of priestes to wayte vpon him. In another place he saith. <HI>Quisquis se vniuersalem sacerdo∣tem</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. lib. 6. epist. 30.</NOTE> <HI>vocat, vel vocari desiderat, in elatione sua Antichristum praecurrit Whosoeuer calleth himself the vniuersal priest, or desireth so to be called, in the pride of his hart is the fore∣runner of Antichrist.</HI> These words were writ∣ten by <HI>Gregorie</HI> more then 900. yeeres since.</P>
<P>If there were euer any that might be knowne by these tokens, which was or is <HI>the prince of pride,</HI> &amp; is called or desireth to be called y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Vni∣uersal priest, or B.</HI> or <HI>hath an army of priests,</HI> I leaue y<SUP>t</SUP> to your iudgemēt, whether the same be he whom <HI>Gregorie</HI> describeth, or some other. I pray God to lighten the eyes of al the world, that all the world may spie him, and the man of sinne may be reueiled.</P>
<P>When the woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> saw the mira∣cles that Christ had done, and heard some men
<PB REF="44"/>
doubte whether hee were Messias or no: why (quoth she) whē Messias shall come, shall he doo moresignes, thē this man hath shewed? So may we say by the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Antichrist</HI> shal come, shal he worke more signes, then they of that See haue done? shal he work more dis∣order in the Church? shal he do more to the dis∣honour of God, and against Christ?</P>
<P>Some man wyll say, that for vnitie sake it is meete, y<SUP>t</SUP> some man be named head of the church But <HI>Gregory</HI> saith, <HI>Siquantitatē vocis perpendi∣mus,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. lib. 6: epist. 30.</NOTE> <HI>duae sunt sillabae: Sipondus iniquitatis, vni∣uersa pernicies.

church is in danger.</HI> In consideration of this great danger which hereby groweth to y<SUP>e</SUP> whole church. <HI>Gregorie</HI> saith to <HI>Iohn</HI> the Boshop of <HI>Constantinople, Tu quid Christo vniuersalis Ec∣clesiae</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. epi. 38.</NOTE> <HI>capiti in extremi iudici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dicturus es exami∣ne, qui cuncta eius membra tibimet conaris vni∣uersalis appellatione supponere? What answer wilt thou make at the trial of the last iudge∣ment vnto Christ the head of the vniuersal Church, which thus by the name of vniuer∣sall Bishop seekest to make all his members subiect vnto thee?</HI> This decay of the church, the olde Catholique Fathers foresaw in their time. When <HI>Constantinus</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> Emperor endowed the churche with landes &amp; possessions, they saye there was a voyce of Angels heard in the ayre, saying, <HI>Hodiè venenum infunditur in Ecclesi∣am,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. de pari∣siis cap. 22. in vita Siluesti.</NOTE> <HI>This daye poyson is powred into the Church.</HI> If there were poyson powred into the Church then, I doubt there was neuer Triacle powred into it since. This we see that from that time shee hath done worse and worse. <HI>Au∣gustine</HI> fyndeth faulte with the multitude of Ceremonies, and sayeth the Churche in hys time was in worse case by mannes deuises, then was the Churche of the Iewes. <HI>Ber∣narde</HI> sayde, <HI>There is no parte sounde in the Cleargie.</HI> And agayne, <HI>They which chuse the first places in the Church, are chiefest in persecuting Christ.</HI> And againe, <HI>Non doctores,
<PB REF="45"/>
sed seductores: non pastores, sed impostores: non praelati, sed Pilati. They be not teachers, but deceiuers: they are not feeders, but be∣guilers: they be not Prelates, but Pilates.</HI></P>
<P>What should I hold you with calling the fa∣thers to witnes in this matter: they themselues that haue bene proctors for y<SUP>e</SUP> Church of Rome, are contented sometimes to acknowledge, that they haue forsakē the original. <HI>Latomus</HI> findeth fault that y<SUP>e</SUP> Lords supper was ministred to the people in one kinde only. <HI>Abbas Panormitane, Faber, Pius secundus,</HI> founde falt with y<SUP>e</SUP> forbid∣ding of priests marriage. <HI>Ex agamia</HI> (saith <HI>Fa∣ber) multi lapsisunt in pedicas diaboli. Many haue fallen into the snares of the deuill, by forsaking mariage.</HI> And further, expresseth the mischiuus purpose of those which brought such ordinance into the Church, by a similitude say∣ing, <HI>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neae texunt subtiliaretia &amp;c. Spyders weaue their webs so smal and fine, that they may scarcely be seene: if any thing fall in∣to them, they first set vpon the head therof, &amp; so take away all sense &amp; feeling. Albertus Pighius</HI> confessed there were errors &amp; abuses in the masse: I will saye nothinge of their life. Some of themselues say that they succeed <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> in place, but <HI>Iudas</HI> in life. <HI>Boniface</HI> being himself a bishop, said, In old time we had treene chalices &amp; goldē priestes, but now we haue trene Priestes, and golden Chalices. And <HI>Adrian</HI>
<PB REF="45"/>
being also a Bishop, said, <HI>Succedimus non Petro in docendo, sed Romulo in parricidio. Wee suc∣ceed not Peter in teaching, but Romulus in slaughter of our brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding (say they) we are succes∣sors to <HI>Peter,</HI> &amp; vicars of christ: we are y<SUP>e</SUP> church. But Christ taketh it for an argument against y<SUP>e</SUP> Scribes &amp; Pharisees, <HI>This did not Abrahā.</HI> You are not the church, you are of your father y<SUP>t</SUP> diuel. And <HI>Micheas, My Priests teach for re∣ward, &amp; my Prophets prophecy for money,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mich. 3.</NOTE> <HI>and yet they rest themselues vpon the Lord and saye, is not God in the middest of vs?</HI> Are not we the church? <HI>Therefore night shal∣be vnto you for a vision, and darknesse shal∣be vnto you for a diuination, and the sunne shal goe downe ouer the Prophets, and the day shalbe darke ouer them.</HI></P>
<P>I wil speake nothing of the blindnes of the time past, for our aduersaries take that for a spe∣cial hold, and cal ignorance the mother of deuo∣tion: and say, Scriptures are a buckler, and a defence for heretikes. Not long sithence, in this citie there were certaine interrogatories put forth, to enquire of suche as then they called heretikes, wherein one inquiry was made in this sort: Item, whether you knowe or haue heard of any person or persons within your pa∣rish, that hath kept, or at this present doth keepe, any heretical, naughtie, and seditious booke or
<PB REF="46"/>
bookes, especially, English Testaments, or Bi∣bles. I fayne not this of my selfe, the booke is to be seene, imprinted euen in this yard. But this matter wil soone be answered, wil they saye: for it followeth, <HI>Falsly trāslated.</HI> That were some∣what, if they woulde appointe you out one, that were translated aright, or did allowe any trans∣lation of the Testament in English to be vsed.</P>
<P>Whensoeuer any great Eclipse chanceth in the sunne or moone, some maruellous impres∣sion, or change, or mortality foloweth vppon the earth: Euen so, when true knowledge faileth in the Church of God, it cannot be but the soules of the people shal perish. If in the little time of <HI>Moses</HI> absence, the people forgate God, and fell to idolatry: if when Christ slumbred, and tooke but a litle nappe in the shippe, the ship began to drowne: how shall it bee with them that receiue not <HI>Moses</HI> at all, and giue no place to our saui∣our Christ, who only is able to saue the Church from drowning? For as <HI>Hilarie</HI> saith, <HI>Ecclesiae</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hillar. in Mat. cap. 8.</NOTE> <HI>intra quas verbum Dei non vigilauerit naufra∣gae sunt: Nō quod Christus in somnum relaxetur, sed quod somno nostro consopiatur in nobis. Those churches are in danger of drowning, wherin the word of God waketh not: Not for that Christ is in any slūber, but because his word is heauy in vs through our heauines:</HI> &amp; <HI>Orig.</HI> sheweth how dangerous y<SUP>e</SUP> state of thē is where, the Gospel is not preached. <HI>Such a Church can
<PB REF="46"/>
not stand before the abominatiō of desola∣tion stedfast, or without danger of seducing,</HI></P>
<P>And therfore Christ compareth his church to the weakest things that be. Sometimes hee cal∣leth it a vine, which vnies it euermore be propte and borne vp, &amp; looked vnto, &amp; pruned, of it selfe is not able to stande, but falleth to the ground, &amp; groweth wilde. Sometimes he likeneth it to a flocke of sheepe, which without attendance, is ready to take infinite maladies. Sometime to a shippe, which if it be not wel prouided on euery side, if it be destitute of light of sunne &amp; starres, is in daunger of the rocke, and windes, &amp; surges of the sea. Sometimes to the moone which hath no light, but from the sunne.</P>
<P>What needeth more proofe in a matter being of it selfe so cleere? Christ himselfe, &amp; <HI>Daniel,</HI> &amp; <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> gaue vs warning that this con∣fusion should come to passe in y<SUP>e</SUP> church of God. We see with our eyes, how farre we are stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed from the original. We see what darknesse and blindnesse hath beene euen in them that shoulde haue ruled the sterne. Good men haue had their eyes opened, and haue poynted to vs that the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te of the shippe a long time hath beene Anti∣christ. The auncient and olde Doctours in their time foresawe that this great captiuitye and confusion, was comming euen vpon them. Our fathers of later yeeres, though our Ad∣uersaries and Patrones of the contrary cause,
<PB REF="47"/>
yea, the Bishopyes of Rome and their chiefe pil∣lars, doe coufesse that the patterne and original, hath not beene kept. Discipline whiche is the greatest bond of the church, hath beene broken: I pray God it may now bee restored. The Sa∣craments that Christ left for our most comfort, haue byn miserably mangled and defaced. Our prayers haue been without spirite and veritye, and so abused, that indeede they were no pray∣ers.</P>
<P>What greater proofes or authorities doe we looke for? Now then, can there bee anye man so wilfull, that will say, there hath been no disorder in the churche? or, that Christ himselfe, and his Apostles (if they were aliue) coulde rule the church in no better sort, then it hath beene, and is by the Pope and his Cardinals?</P>
<P>But me thinke I heare some say, The church cannot bee so forsaken, it is the house and tem∣ple of God, it is the spouse of Christe: Christ made her a sure promise, that he woulde neuer forsake her. <HI>Ero vobiscum vs{que} ad consummatio∣nem soeculi, <HI>I will bee with you to the end of</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 28.</NOTE> <HI>the worlde.</HI> All this is true, yet is it not true, that euery particular churche of the worlde shal be established for euer. For, was not this temple that <HI>Salomon</HI> built, the temple of God? yet was it ouer throwen, and burnt down to the grounde by y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Chaldees. Iupiters</HI> image was set vp in it by <HI>Antiochus.</HI> It was afterward ouerthrowen
<PB REF="47"/>
by the Emperour <HI>Titus,</HI> yet was it the temple of God. Gods house is a house of prayer, yet Christ saith, <HI>Vos fecistis speluncam latronum,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 19.</NOTE> <HI>You haue made it a denne of theeues.</HI> The Lord made choise of his Uine, he loued it, it was a chosen heritage, yet <HI>Ieremie</HI> saith, <HI>Many pa∣stours</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 12.</NOTE> <HI>haue destroyed my Vineyard, &amp; tro∣den my portion vnder foote, of my chosen place, they haue made a desolate wildernes <HI>Hierusalem</HI></HI> was called the holy city, yet is shee charged, that shee hath played the harlot and done shamefully. The Iewes called themselues the people of God, but Christe calleth them the <HI>Synagogue of Satan.</HI> The Church of God is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel, 2.</NOTE> called the holy place, yet Christ saith, the abho∣mination of desolation, and <HI>S. Paule</HI> saieth, the man of sinne shal stand in the holy place.</P>
<P>If we beleeue Christ, and his Apostles, that forewarned vs hereof: if we beleeue the old doc∣tours: if we beleeue the writers of later yeeres, if we beleeue such as God hath stirred vp in our time to reuiue his Gospel: if we beleeue our aduersaries: if we beleeue our owne senses an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> experience: let vs confesse that the Church hath byn defaced with abuses: let vs giue God thāks, that of his great mercies hath restored it, and lee vs euery man endeuour to reediffe it.</P>
<P>God had mollified the Kings hearte to bee gracious towards them, he had deliuered them, he had restored them home to their countrie, hee
<PB REF="48"/>
gaue them Prophetes to call vppon them, and a godly Prince to rule ouer them: but the peo∣ple cried out, <HI>The time is not yet come that the Lordes house shoulde be buylded.</HI> Here must I touche the causes that withholde men from the buylding vp of Gods Temple, not al that may be reckoned: For that wold require more time. but onely the chiefest, that shall come to hand.</P>
<P>The first seemed to be dispaire of the cause. For they sawe it was a long trauayle from <HI>Ba∣bylon</HI> to <HI>Hierusalem.</HI> They had beene spoiled of all they had, and were poore, and the greatest part euen of their owne people forsooke them, and would not returne home with them. Theyr enemies were strong, and laughed them to scorne, and hindered their buildinges. Others charged them with sedition, and sayde, if these men may once recouer their city, they will paye no more tribute, they will be no longer in sub∣iection, and this matter at length shall redound to the kings dammage. Looke in your Chroni∣cles, and you shal find that the Iewes haue euer byn traytours.</P>
<P>Euen so, when the man of God <HI>Luther</HI> was raysed vp by God to reforme the church, a friend of his said vnto him, O father <HI>Luther,</HI> you shal neuer be able to preuayle: the Pope &amp; princes, and al the world are against you: The matter is past recouery: goe into your study, &amp; say, <HI>Deus
<PB REF="48"/>
miscreatur nostri.</HI> Euē so, whēsoeuer it pleaseth God to build vp the walles of his tēple▪ he choo∣seth out such, y<SUP>•</SUP> for their owne infirmities, &amp; for the force &amp; strength of their enimies, they might be discouraged, and despaire. Euen now that it hath pleased God to restore his gospel, they that are of the contrary part, crie out, These men be rebels, they woulde haue no magistrate, they would haue al things in common. Behold what they haue done in <HI>Heluetia:</HI> beholde what they haue done in <HI>Germanie:</HI> Looke out your Chro∣nicles, you shal finde that al the vproares and se∣ditions which haue been these forty yeeres, haue byn stirred vp by some of them.</P>
<P>But all this discouraged not the good Prince <HI>Zorobabel,,</HI> hee armed himselfe with Gods promise against all impossibilities, and so called the people to the huylding of the tem∣ple. And therefore GOD prospered him, and moued the king <HI>Darius</HI> hearte to make procla∣mation, that whosoeuer would withstand <HI>Zoro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abel</HI> in his doinges, tymber shoulde bee taken out of his owne house, and a gallowes made, and he thereon hanged without redemption.</P>
<P>Euen so, that man of GOD despayred not, though hee same all the worlde against him, but gaue the glory to GOD. And therefore God blessed his doinges as wee see this daye. For it is the cause of GOD, and not of man.
<PB REF="49"/>
The zeale of the Lord of hostes hath done this. I wil bring this to passe (saith the Lord) not for your sakes, but that my name may bee glorified among the nations. For God chooseth y<SUP>e</SUP> weake thinkes, and the foolish thinges of the world. As for the Aduersaries, be they neuer so strong, he that dwelleth in the heauens laugheth them to scorne. These, through feare and dispaire, keepe backe from building the temple.</P>
<P>Some there be that confesse, that manye things are out of frame, and ought to be looked on, but they say, it is no time to fall a buylding. We must looke for a generall Councel. And God graunt we may once see that daye, that a general Councel may be called, wherein Christ may sit president, and all these matters that are nowe in question, maye haue indifferent hea∣ring, and maye bee decided by the woorde of God.</P>
<P>But alas, they that make a face and shewe of general Councels, them selues stoppe and staye, that there may be no generall Councell. When <HI>Luther</HI> made his first appeale from the Pope that then was, to a generall councell, they made him answeare that it was against the de∣cree of Pope <HI>Iulius,</HI> and Pope <HI>Pius,</HI> that anye appeale shoulde bee made from the Pope to any councel.</P>
<P>When the Emperour had compelled them to a Councel, and the Princes of Germanie &amp;
<PB REF="49"/>
common weales, had sent learned men thither: the Bishops that were there assembled, woulde not heare any of them preache, or dispute, or de∣clare their minde. For onely bishops may sit &amp; speake in their councel, and suche as are sworne to mainteine the Pope. <HI>Aeneas Syluius,</HI> other∣wise <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aeneas Syl∣uius ad capi∣tulum Magū∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in.</NOTE> called Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the second, saith, if a Bi∣shop speake against the Pope, yea although hee speake the truth, yet neuertheles hee sinneth a∣gainst the othe, that he hath made vnto the pope.</P>
<P>And last of all, when the Councell hath done all that it can, the whole conclusion of the mat∣ter hangeth vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> determination of the Pope. Now iudge you, what sentence there is like to be, where as hee shalbe iudge in his owne cause. Thus when they crye out and speake of Coun∣cels, they seeke delay, they mocke with God and man, and indeed meane to haue no councel.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Paul,</HI> after hee was called of God, and touched in his heart and couscience with Gods trueth, appealed not to a generall Councel, but saith, <HI>Non acquieni carni &amp; sanguini, I com∣municated not with fleshe and blood. The</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Galat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Matt.

<P>A Councel may testifie the trueth to be truth, but it cannot make falshood to be truth. <HI>Augu∣stine</HI> aunsweared most indifferently, writing to <HI>Maximinus</HI> a Bishop of y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Arrsans</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> alleaged a

<P>Whē <HI>Agisilaus</HI> minded to make his passage with his army through his neighbors lande, he desired licence of the prince of that countrie: the prince saide, he coulde make him no ready aun∣swere, but that he would take aduise of his coun∣cel. Wel then said <HI>Agesilaus,</HI> take you aduise∣ment: in the meane season, I wil passe through. So when our aduersaries delay off, &amp; soiourne til they may take their deliberation in a coun∣cel, let them deliberate while they wil: but in the meane season, let vs passe on in the busines of God, and take the occasion offered vs to buylde by a house to the Lord.</P>
<P>Some other say, it is not yet time: y<SUP>e</SUP> Bishops be they that should redresse the church. Would to God they would. For they should be <HI>Lux mū∣di, The light of the world,</HI> they should be <HI>shep∣heards,</HI> &amp; <HI>Watchmen,</HI> they should be builders of Gods church. But, what if the light become darknes? What if the shepheardes become
<PB REF="50"/>
wolues? What if the Watchmen lye asleepe? what if the builders become ouerthrowers? <HI>Ie∣remie</HI> saith, the Pastours haue ouerthrowen the Uineyard: and is it likely that they wil reare it vp again? Christ said vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> bishops, you haue made my house a denne of theeues: &amp; is it likely that they wil bring it againe to the former state, and make it a place of prayer? But, O merciful God, what a building is that like to bee, where ignorance is the foundation, where ignoraunce is deuotion, and the greatest corner stone of the buylding. I pray God lighten their hearts w<SUP>t</SUP> his holy spirite, and make them to bee that they professe themselues to be, the light of the world, and true labourers in Gods Uineyarde, &amp; faith∣ful buylders of his house.</P>
<P>In the meane season let vs remember, that in the olde Lawe, whensoeuer the Byshoppe grewe out of order, God raysed vp sometimes Prophetes, sometimes Princes, to refourme the churche, to redresse things that were amisse, and to reedifie the decayes. For the Prince is keeper of the Lawe of GOD, and that of both Tables, as wel of the first that pertayneth to Religion, as of the seconde that pertayneth to good order. For he is the Head of the peo∣ple, not onelye of the commons and La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, but also of the Ministers and Cleargye. By that au∣thoritye. <HI>Moses</HI> beynge a Magistrate rebuked <HI>Aaron</HI> the Bishop, for making the golden calfe.
<PB REF="51"/>
<HI>Ioas</HI> beeing a king, redressed the riot of the Priestes, <HI>Salomon</HI> being King, firste builded the temple of God, &amp; put down the high Bishop <HI>A∣biathar,</HI> and set vp <HI>Sadoc.</HI> Afterwarde, the same Temple being polluted was restored, not by the Bishoppes, but by the Kings <HI>Ezechias, Iosias, Abias, Iehosaephat:</HI> &amp; at this time after the cap∣tiuitie of <HI>Babylon,</HI> it was restored, not by the Bishoppes. but by <HI>Zorobabel</HI> the Prince of <HI>Iuda.</HI></P>
<P>And after the comming of Christ, when the Emperours became christened, <HI>Constantine</HI> a Godly Emperour, threatned the Bishops, if they would not be ruled. he would take vppon him to see them punished, as hauing in deed au∣thority and power ouer Bishoppes. And <HI>Iustini∣anus</HI> in his law threatneth the Bishops, that if they woulde not make their prayers in a loude voyce, that y<SUP>•</SUP> people might say Amen, he would punish them with his sworde, as hath been sayd before.</P>
<P>But what needeth more examples? When the Arke of God was restored home, <HI>Dauid</HI> be∣ing King, played the chiefest part: <HI>Dauid</HI> being King, made Psalmes and ditties: <HI>Dauid</HI> being King, daunced before the Arke: and being king, set the Bishops &amp; Priestes in order. And for this cause they are kings, euen to serue y<SUP>•</SUP> Lord. And therefore they doe not wel that deuide common weales in two, and deuise two heads, the one for
<PB REF="51"/>
the spiritualtie, the other for the laitie. For <HI>S. Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Omnis anima superioribus potestati∣bus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.</NOTE> <HI>subdita sit. Let euery soule bee subiect to the higher powers.</HI> Euery soule, whether he be bishop, Cardinal, or Pope, al are subiect to their Prince. And <HI>Chrisostome</HI> vpon that place, saith, <HI>Etiam si Apostolus sis, si Euangelista, siue Prophe∣ta, siue quisquis tandem fueris, ne{que} enim pietatē</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 23. in 13. Rom.</NOTE> <HI>subuertit ista subiectio. Yea, if thou be an Apo∣stle, if thou be an Euāgelist, if thou be a Pro∣phet, or of what state soeuer thou be: for this subiection is no hinderāce to godlines.</HI> And of the superiority of Princes power, <HI>Tertullian</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. ad Scapulam.</NOTE> speaketh thus. <HI>Colimus imperatorem, vt hominē à Deo secundum, solo Deo minorem. We woor∣shippe the Emperour as a man nexte vnto God, and inferiour onely vnto God.</HI></P>
<P>Some other there be that see and knowe, that the Church of God is nowe a building, and yet not onely refraine themselues from the worke, but also spurne down that other men haue built vp: that see wee teach nothing but the word of God, and the doctrine of the primitiue church: &amp; yet least they should seeme to receiue the doc∣trine which they haue persecuted, inforce them selues to be constant, and lay violent hands vpō their owne conscience, and saye, <HI>Non regnabit super nos, He shal not beare rule ouer vs:</HI> and as <HI>Pharao</HI> said in the hardnes of his heart, <HI>Nes∣cio Dominum.</HI> I know not the Lord.</P>
<P><PB REF="52"/>
I take not here vpon me to iudge other mens consciences: but such men there haue byn, as we may know by reading, &amp; as God hath opened by notable iudgement, &amp; I pray God there be none such now. I pray God there be none that offend against their own conscience, and knowledge, and against the holy spirit of God.</P>
<P>But alas, I speake not now of the ignorant and vnlearned sort of people, that offend of sim∣plicity, and haue a zeale of God, although it be not according to knowledge: but I speake of them that be learned, that knowe well, that wee teach you nothing this day, but that Christ and his Apostles taught before vs, &amp; was euermore frequēted throughout the church, vntil al things grew to corruption. And of the contrary parte, they doe know, and their consciences doe testifie vnto them, that their doctrine for the most parte is contrary to the vse of the primitiue churche, contrary to the Apostles, contrary to Christe himselfe.</P>
<P>Yet wil these men sooner leaue their liuing, then bee present at the hearing of an Englishe prayer, or communicate with the people vnder both kyndes. They call it a schisme to haue the common prayers in a tongue that the peo∣ple may vnderstande. To communicate vnder both kindes, they call it a schisme. For the Mi∣nisters to be maried, they cal it a schisme. And o∣ther like things which were tedious to rehear se

at length. Those thinges which were ordeyned by Christ and his Apostles, &amp; vsed throughout the whole Catholique primitiue Churche with∣out question, they cal schismaticall.</P>
<P>O mercifull God, shall wee saye, that all the whole world of the Christians, euer from Chri∣stes time, vntil the late time of these later Fa∣thers, was in a continual schisme? Shal we say that <HI>S. Augustine, S. Ambrose,</HI> and other old fa∣thers, were schismatiques: Shall wee say that Christ and his Apostles taught vs schismes: or that was once true, and Christian doctrine-is it nowe become a schisme? Is the Churche nowe within fiue hundreth yeeres become Catholike: and was Christes church, and the Apostles churche, and the Doctours church not Catho∣like: O Lord, if we be deceiued, thou hast decei∣ued vs: for if in these doings we be schismatikes, for hauing prayer in a knowen tongue, or for communion vnder both kindes, or for the ma∣riage of Priestes and Ministers, where as thou gauest thy communion vnder both kindes, and didst choose such as were married to be thy Apo∣stles, and didst pray in the common and vulgar tongue, as also thy Apostle <HI>Paule</HI> taught vs to do: If this be schisme, we are become schismati∣ques, for folowing thine example. and that ordi∣nance which thou hast left vnto thy Church.</P>

fidei: Christus dixit, Apostolus dixit. This is a rule of faith, to</HI> say, <HI>Christ hath said it, the A∣postle hath said it.</HI> Christ saith, <HI>Bibite ex hoc omnes, Drinke ye al of this,</HI> without exception, <HI>Paul</HI> biddeth vs to pray so, that the people may say <HI>Amen.</HI> And sayeth, <HI>Honorabile coniugium in omnibus, Mariage is honorable in al men.</HI> Then is this by <HI>Hylaries</HI> rule the Catholique faith, &amp; the contrary is Schismaticall: for our faith is buylded vppon the foundation of the A∣postles and Prophets. <HI>S. Cyprian</HI> saith, <HI>Non pax est sed bellum, nec Ecclesiae iungitur, qui ab Euan∣gelio</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyprian. Ser∣mone 5. de lapsis.</NOTE> <HI>separatur. It is no peace but war, no Ca∣tholike peace or vnity, but opē war &amp; schis∣me: neither can he say, I am of the Church: that is diuided from the gospel. Iustinus mar¦tyr,</HI> as it is reported by <HI>Eusebius,</HI> saide, <HI>Ipsi Do∣mino non acquiescerem, si alium Deum diceret</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesia. histo. lib. 4. cap. 18.</NOTE> <HI>praeter omnium Creatorem. I would not beleue Christ himself, if he should say there were an¦other God then the creator of al things.</HI> If he would not beleeue God himselfe, teaching o∣therwise then is sette downe by the woorde of God, much lesse would he beleeue the Churche, teaching contrary to the Gospel.</P>
<P>God of his mercy graunt that al our contro∣uersies that we now stand vpon, may be hearde and determined by Gods Gospel, and open the eyes of our aduersaries, that they may see the hope whereunto they are called. In the meane

season let not vs shunne or refraine them, but exhort and counsel them with al sobrietie in the spirite of meekenesse, as our brethren. Who knoweth whether God of his mercie will call them to repentaunce? As God sayde to <HI>Saynt Paule by Reuelation, Populus mihi multus est in hac ciuitate, I haue much people in this ci∣tie:</HI> So I trust I may say, at least I doubt not but wee may charitably hope, God hath a great number euen among them that runne to the Masse, that will yet heare no reason, but are stubborne and wilfull. Their hearts are in the handes of God, and he is able, and will mollifie them, and of stony wil make them fleshy, and of stones make them the children of Abraham, and the principall corner stones in the building of his Church.</P>
<P>Other impedimentes there bee, that keepe men from the buylding of Gods house. But that which GOD complayneth of by the Pro∣phet, is, that euery man fell to builde his owne house, and lefte the house of God vnbuilded. This is the corruption of our nature. Such thinges as we shoulde glorifie God withall, we abuse moste to the dishonour of God. There∣fore Christe calleth them <HI>thornes, and the Mammon of wickednesse,</HI> not because they are so of themselues, for they are the giftes of God, but because our frowarde nature maketh them so.</P>

<P>O good my Lordes and brethren, I come not hither to bee a Patrone for money mat∣ters: GOD seeth my hearte before whome I speake it. But I see Gods Temple by this meanes is forsaken. Young men, suche as are of moste to wardenesse turne them selues to be Phisitions, or men of Lawe: yea. Clearkes, or Apothecaries. The matter is so vsed, that they are ashamed to bee Ministers in Gods Churche. They shoulde not so doe, saye you: no, neyther yet you, as your dooinges are, can bee angrye with them.

<P>O mercifull GOD, at the beginning of the Gospell, euerye man brought his goodes, and layde them at the feete of the Disciples.

and is appointed to the building and preseruing of Gods Church,, that euery man layeth handes on, and counteth to bee his owne. In the meane season, the poore Uniuersities are neg∣lected, the schooles euerye where vnfurnished, the youth driuen and chased away from the buil∣ding.</P>
<P>Thinke of this in your heartes: Consider with your selues. There lacke already Mini∣sters throughout the Realme; to teach the peo∣ple, &amp; to builde vp the walles of Gods Church. One poore hireling is driuen to serue two or three Parishes. The sicke hath no man to com∣forte or counsell them: the dead haue no man to burie them: one man burieth another. That thing I knowe is not materiall: yet it seemeth not so to al men, and our bodies are the Tem∣ples of the holy Ghost, and ought reuerently to be brought to their graues.</P>
<P>Uiew your Vniuersities: view your schooles which euer haue beene nourceries to this pur∣pose: alas, how many shall you finde in both the Uniuersities, and in all the Schooles through England, not onely that are already rype, but also that are mynded to the Ministe∣rye: If they be not founde there, alas where thinke you to haue them: Where thinke you will they be found? Thinke you that they will spring out of the grounde, or droppe downe from the Heauens: No, no, they be of you, and

must be bred and reared amongst you. If there be none to be founde, nor hope of any to be here∣after: be you wel assured that Actes of Parlia∣ment, and Proclamations, are not enough to content the conscience of the people, and to build vp the Temple.</P>
<P>Oh, that the Queenes Maiesty knewe the great scarcitie, and miserable neede of Mini∣sters that is abroade. And I beseech you good my Lordes, and other Honourable and Wor∣shipfull that are heere, that haue or maye haue accesse vnto her, to put her in remembraunce, that her grace will be mindefull of the house of GOD, and redresse the greedinesse both of corupt patrones, and of such who engrosse and gather into their handes many liuinges, being them selues the remnaunt of the ignoraunt and persecuting <HI>Babylon:</HI> and yet leaue to take charge ouer the people, blynde Syr Iohns not onely lacke Latin, but lacke honestie, and lacke conscience, and lack religion.

Euen so may I say, what∣soeuer we see that they haue done, that were our later fathers before vs, that haue destroy∣ed Christes Church, let vs remember to doe the contrary. Their foundation as you know, and as they themselues confesse, is ignoraunce: let our foundation be Christ, and knowledge of Gods word. They haue pulled the Scriptures out of the peoples heades and handes, that no man might see their doings. Let vs exhort all men, as <HI>S.

For it is not possible, by what meanes things haue growen to corruption, that by the same meanes they shall euer bee wel re∣stored againe.</P>
<P>After the Temple was builded, or was in building and rearing, <HI>Esdras</HI> the Prophete read the Lawe of GOD, and sacrificed Ox∣en, sheepe, and Lambes. and the people wepte in consider action that they and their fathers had so vnkindly offended God, and deserued so ex∣treamely to be punished at his hande. So the good king <HI>Iosias,</HI> after he had founde the booke of the Lawe, and sawe howe highly both he and his fathers had offended God, hee fell a wee∣ping: (for the consideration of Gods greate benefites, and our owne vnwoorthinesse, can∣seth vs to mourne at the sight of our owne vnkindenesse.) Then they turned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD, repented themselues of their wickednesse, and left suche vanities as they had walked in be∣fore. So Christ our Sauiour, when he began to preache the Gospell, and to spreade abroade the vnspeakeable treasure of our saluation, cal∣led vs first to repentance, and said, <HI>Poenitentiam agite, appropinquauit enim regnum coelorum.

Repentye, for the kingdō of God is at hād. Zachaeus</HI> when he had receiued Christ to his ta∣ble, repented him of his excortion, and made re∣stitution. <HI>Then Iesus sayd vnto him. This day is saluatiō come vnto this house, forasmuch</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 19.</NOTE> <HI>as he is also become the sonne of Abraham.</HI> So the Christian men in the beginning repen∣ted themselues, and changed their whole life, &amp; therfore were called Saintes: as <HI>S. Paul</HI> vseth in many places to name them, <HI>Vocatis Sanctis, to those which are called Saints.</HI> And, <HI>sanctis qui sunt Corinthi, To the Saintes which are at Corinth. Plinie</HI> being a heathen, and set by the Emperour to enquire of Christian men, made report in his Epistle to <HI>Traianus,</HI> that they were a sect which would not offer vp to Idols, which coulde not be compelled to blaspheme Christ, but were wont at certayne times appointed to meete together and sing hymnes to one <HI>Christ</HI> their God, that they were of one mynd, &amp; agreed among themselues, and did absteine from theft, murther, and adultery, and did keepe their faith, and defra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed no man.</P>
<P>Euen such should we be, thus ought we to liue, these things are examples for vs to follow, we should meet often to sing hymnes and giue thankes to our God, we should lament our for∣mer wickednes, wherwich we haue called Gods anger vpon vs.</P>
<P>But alas, there appeareth not in vs that
<PB REF="59" MS="y"/>
chaunge of life that ought to be in such as turne to Christ, we are as proude, as couetous, and wicked in abusing the holy name of God, as e∣uer we were in the time of ignorance. Thus we abuse the great mercy of God, thus we with∣hold his trueth in vnrighteousnesse. We say we know God, but giue him not the glorye that is due vnto God.</P>
<P>And besides this, wee are in loue with our owne corruption: and as the Prophet sayeth, we reioyce when we haue done wickedly: wee can∣not abide to haue our fault touched, our pride is growen vp as hie as heauen, our couetousnesse is sunke as deepe as hell, our poore weake bre∣thren be offended, and think that these be the ve∣ry fruites of Christes gospel. Yet we can in no wise suffer to be reproued, we say to the Prea∣cher, peace, and talke not to vs in the name of the Lord, tell not vs of the Scriptures, tel not vs of <HI>Christ,</HI> of <HI>Peter,</HI> &amp; <HI>Paul:</HI> we did him speake vs faire, and blesse those things that be accursed by Gods owne mouth. We say, he is too busie, he medleth with that he knoweth not. Yes, yes man, he knoweth it wel inough, he knoweth that pride is pride, that vsury is vsury, that sinne is sinne: and thou &amp; thine owne conscience know∣est it too, if thou wouldest be knowen of it: yea, thou knowest it, &amp; indeede in thy heart, of force art weary of it, And this is extreeme miserie, that we are so farre plunged in sinne, that wee

Is this the thanks that we render vnto God, for gi∣uing vnto vs so great blessings? But, what sayd I, blessings? Would God we were so blessed, that we might consider our blessednesse. Ma∣ny alreadie bewray the weakenesse of their sto∣makes, they brooke not the Gospell: yea, they seeme already weary of these Preachers, they call them Pulpit men, men of the spirite, and I knowe not what: as though they themselues had nothinge to doo with Gods spirite. Ha mercifull God, what way may GOD take to winne you? Alas, what are wee? what haue wee offended you? Are we become your ene∣mies, for tellinge you the trueth? I feare mee, this murinuring is not agaynst vs, but against the Lord.</P>
<P>You haue had the Masse, and that you wor∣thely hated: you haue now the Communion, and that you regard not.

<P>But God is iust, and the extreame disdaine of Gods trueth, and his holy Gospel, iustly de∣serueth the extremitie of Gods vengeance: and this Gospell, that you are already so weary of, shal be taken away from vs. The kingdome of God shalbe taken away from vs, and shalbe gi∣uen to a nation, that shal do the fruites of it.

Let y<SUP>e</SUP> zeale of Gods owne house rauish and deuour our hearts, let vs build vp the cabernacle of the most holy, and dreadful, and euer liuing God: so will God dwell and abide with vs, and be glorified in the middest a∣mongst vs.</P>

Some other, that man was made to consider and behold the Sunne and Moone, the starres, the course, and reuolutions of the Heauens.

<P>Therfore haue we Temples and Churches, places to resorte vnto altogether, to honour, to worship, and to acknowledge him to be our god, to ioyne our hearts and voyces together, and to call vpon his holy name.

<HI>in domum Domini ibimus. O</HI> (saith that holye man) <HI>my hart reioyced within my body, whē my fellowes called vpon me, and said, Let vs go into the house of the Lord.</HI> Againe, <HI>I am in loue with the beauty of thy house.</HI> And a∣gain, <HI>O how beautiful is thy tabernacle, O Lord, O thou</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>God of hosts, my heart lon∣geth &amp; fainteth to come within thy courts.</HI> His spirits were rauished with the sight &amp; maie∣sty of the tabernacle: not for y<SUP>•</SUP> the place it selfe at y<SUP>•</SUP> time was so beautiful, for in <HI>Dauids</HI> time it was almost rotten, &amp; ruinous, a homely thing to behold, nothing in comparison to that tēple that afterward was built by <HI>Salomon.</HI> But therein stood the shew &amp; worthines of that holy place, y<SUP>•</SUP> Gods trueth and lawe was opened and proclai∣med in it, and the sacraments, and ceremonies so vsed, in such forme and order, as God had com∣manded them to be vsed, &amp; the people receiued them obediently, and liued thereafter.</P>
<P>Therfore when the tabernacle was restored, when the Arke was fet home from <HI>Obededom,</HI> and set in the mount <HI>Sion:</HI> when Religion re∣uiued, which through the negligence and malice of <HI>Saul</HI> was forsaken: when he saw his nobility, his Bishoppes, his Priestes, and all his people willing and forward, he could not refraine him selfe, but brake out and song, <HI>Haec est dies, quam fecit Dominus, exultemus &amp; laetemurin ea. This is the day which</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Lord hath made, let vs be</HI>
<PB REF="64"/>
glad and reioyce in it. Let vs be merry, &amp; ioye that euer we liued to see it. Euen so <HI>Paul</HI> when in his time hee saw the Gospel take roote and prosper, and that the sauour of life was powred abroade, that the kingdome of God was enlar∣ged, and the kingdome of <HI>Satan</HI> shaking down, his heart leaped, and sprong within him. <HI>Ecce nunc tempus acceptabile, Behold now that ac∣ceptable time,</HI> behold God hath looked downe mercifully vpon the world, beholde the daye of saluation is come vpon vs.</P>
<P>But the godly man, as hee reioyceth at the beautie of Gods house, so when contrariwise he seeth the same disordered filthily, when he seeth the Sacraments of God abused, the trueth tro∣den vnder foote, the people mocked, the name of god dishonoured, he cānot but lament &amp; mourn, and finde himselfe wounded at heart. When the good king <HI>Iosias</HI> saw the booke of god, whiche was so long hid in y<SUP>•</SUP> wall, &amp; out of remēbrance: when he considered the blindenes, in which they had liued, &amp; the vnkindnes of their forfathers, he could not forbeare, but fell a weeping: he fea∣red least god would take vengeance vpō thē for so great cōtempt of his word. Whē <HI>Ieremy</HI> saw the wilfulnes, and frowardnesse of the people, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 9.</NOTE> which would not submit themselues, and be obe∣dient vnto god, he cryed, <HI>Oh, that my head were ful of water, &amp; mine eyes a fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and hight
<PB REF="65"/>
&amp;c.</HI> Such care had they for Gods people: thus the zeale of Gods house had eaten them vp.</P>
<P>Zeale, if any man know not the nature of the word, is an earnest affection and vehement loue, as is the loue of a mother towards her children, or of y<SUP>e</SUP> natural child towards his mother. This zeale cannot abyde to see that thing which it lo∣ueth, despised or hurt. Such a zeale and care ca∣rieth God ouer his people, hee loueth them as a mother loueth her little children: he wil not suf∣fer them to be hurt. By y<SUP>e</SUP> Prophet <HI>Esai</HI> he saith, <HI>Can a woman forget her childe, &amp; not haue cōpassion on the sonne of her womb? thogh</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 49.</NOTE> <HI>they should forget, yet wil I not forget thee. Zachary</HI> also saith, <HI>He that toucheth you, tou∣cheth</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the apple of his eie.</HI> For God hath said, they shalbe my people, and I wil be their God. Such care likewise heare al the godly towards their God, they loue him with all their soule, with al their heart, with al their strength: they reuerence him as their deare father, they are grieued at anye blasphemy, and with anye con∣tempt of his holy name.</P>
<P>But, as euery man be he neuer so wicked, yea euen he that saieth in his heart there is no God, which is become filthy &amp; abhominable in al his doings, yet in his talke outwardly saith he hath a God, and that hee beleeueth in him: euen so there is none so wicked, or so forsaken of God in his heart, but he perswadeth himselfe hee hath

the zeale of GOD: and what he doth in selfe loue of his owne fantasie, hee will beare in hand, he doth it for the loue of God. The ouer∣throwers and wasters of the Churche, will seeme to shew a speciall care for the Churche. Dissemblers, hypocrites, despisers, scorners, euen suche as sinne agaynst the holye Ghost, which denie the trueth of God after they haue knowen it, which witting and knowing fight against the trueth, which say of Christ, we will not haue him to rule ouer vs, which worke that sinne that shall neuer bee forgeuen in this worlde, nor in the worlde to come, yet notwith∣standing wil pretend and seem to haue the zeale of God.</P>
<P>Thus the Scribes and Pharisies set vp their bristles against Christ: thy Disciples keep not the common fast: thou sufferest them to put and to eate the eares of corne: thou sufferest them to eate with vnwashed handes: thou brea∣kest the tradition of the Elders: thou breakest the Law of God, which he gaue vs by Moses: thou art a seditious teacher: thou art a schisma∣tike, thou art an Heretike. They sayde, we fast twise in the Weeke: wee haue Abraham to our father: we are Moses Disciples. Ther∣fore when they hearde <HI>Stephen</HI> speaking those heauenly words, <HI>Behold, I see the heauens o∣pen,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Actes 7.</NOTE> <HI>and the Sonne of man standing at the right hand of God,</HI> through zeale they gaue a

shoute with a loud voyce, &amp; stopped their eares, and ran vpon him al at once.</P>
<P>When Christ had said, <HI>Ye shall see the sonne</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4▪</NOTE> <HI>of man sit at the right hād of God, &amp; come in the clouds of heauē: the hie priest</HI> through zeale <HI>rent his clothes,</HI> &amp; sayd, <HI>Ye haue heard the blasphemie.</HI> This naughty man speaketh blasphemie against God. He called a Councell, the Scribes &amp; Pharisies met together, not one man amongst them but of themselues: they loo∣ked about them, as if they only were the pillars and buttresses of the church, and were only zea∣lous and carefull for the house of God. But their meeting was (as <HI>Dauid</HI> forespake, and as <HI>Peter</HI> declareth, and as wee knowe) against the Lorde, and against annointed. They were touched with zeale of their owne glory, &amp; not with the zeale of Gods trueth. They sought their owne praise, but not the praise which is of God. They made crakes that they knewe the scriptures, that they were the Temple of God, that they had the consent of al antiquitye: as o∣thers haue done since that time, and as wee see many do this day, &amp; in very deed, these men now haue euen as much as they had then, as by proof and triall it wil appeare.</P>
<P>There are others, which haue a feeling of God, and a great care for his Church: but such a feeling and care as commeth either of their owne fantasies, or of some opinion and credite
<PB REF="66"/>
they haue in their Fathers which were before them, not of the vnderstanding of Gods plea∣sure. Such are they which offende God, not of malice or wilfulnesse, but onelye for lacke of teaching and vnderstanding. Such were they whiche withstoode <HI>Saint Paule</HI> in all his prea∣ching, for that they tooke him for an Heretike, and thought his preaching was against God. <HI>I beare them witnesse</HI> (saith he) <HI>that they haue the zeale of GOD, but not according to</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10.</NOTE> <HI>knowledge.</HI> Such a zeale haue many who for∣bid that God commandeth, and commande that which God forbiddeth. Such a zeale had <HI>Paule</HI> himselfe, <HI>I was a blasphemer, &amp; a persecutor,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Tim. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; an oppressor: but I was receiued to mer∣cy, for I did it ignorauntly without beliefe.</HI> Such a zeale haue they, who think they do God good seruice, whē they kil &amp; murther the righte∣ous &amp; good seruāts of God. Such a zeale haue they, who (as saith <HI>Naziāzen)</HI> defend Christ a∣gainst Christ, and defend the church against the church. And these things do they, not of malice, nor of wilfulnes, nor against their conscience, but, because they knowe not God the father, nor his Christ whō he hath sent. Therfore they trū∣ble at Christe, &amp; spurn away the gospel of God, &amp; thinke ill, &amp; speake euil of the word or life, be∣cause they know not the Gospel of God, nor the word of life. Thus they perswade themselues, that they defend the Church, that they honour
<PB REF="67"/>
the sonne of God, that they doe God great ser∣uice, and that they haue the zeale of God.</P>
<P>But this pride was euer in the heart of man, and it appeared euen in our Graundsire Adam: whatsoeuer liketh vs well, wee thinke that can∣not but please GOD. Suche is the opinion wee fondely conceiue in our fantasies: in trust wherof whatsoeuer we doe, we think our selues sure &amp; safe. <HI>Origen</HI> writing vpon the place of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Origen. in 10. Rom. lib. 8.</NOTE> Apostle, <HI>Zelum Dei habent, sed non secundum scientiam, They haue the zeale of God, but not according to knowledge,</HI> saith, <HI>Similiter potest dicere Apostolus &amp; de alijs, quod timorem Dei habeant, sed non secundum scientiam, de a∣lijs &amp;c. In like maner the Apostle may say of others, they haue the feare of God, but not according to knowledge: of others, they haue the loue of God, but not according to knowledge: of another, he hath the faith of God, but not according to knowledge: And another may be saide to fast, but not accor∣ding to knowledge. And so in all thinges whatsoeuer we doe, vnlesse wee haue know∣ledge &amp; vnderstanding, it may be said vnto vs, that we haue the zeale of a good worke; but not according to knowledge. Ideo danda est praecipue opera scientiae, neres nobis infaeliciter accidat. vt in fide positi frustremur a fide, zelum habentes bonorum, decidamus a bonis. Therefore al heed is chiefly to be giuē to the attaining
<PB REF="67"/>
of knowledge; least it goe not well with vs, least we faile frō our faith, whē we thinke we beleue, &amp; thinking we haue a zeale of good workes, wee bee founde voyde of all good workes.</HI> The wise man saith. <HI>This was not e∣nough <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisd. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> for thē, that they erred in the know∣ledge of god: but wheras they liued in great warres of ignorance, those so manie and so great plagues they called peace.</HI> The zeale that they had, and the contentation of their heartes made them beleeue that all their super∣stition and idolatrie, and other enormities was Catholike vnitie.</P>
<P>This zeale, as on the one side it hath manye tokens of goodnes, for that it hath a conscience, and a feare, and an obedience towardes God: so, on the other side it is very daungerous, be∣cause it lacketh knowledge: euen as a shippe for lacke of a Gouernaur is euer in daunger of the rockes, and as the body whiche hath no eye, is euer in daunger of falling. Such kinde of zeale, the greater it is, the worser it is: the more vehement it seemeth, the more vthementlye it fighteth against God. For, our good meaning maketh not our doinges good: our zeale is not a rule, whereby we may measure our either our faith, or our workes: but onely the knowen will and pleasure of God. Therefore speaketh God in this maner by the prophet <HI>Esai, my thoughts are not your thoghts, neither are your ways</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>
<PB REF="68"/>
<HI>my wayes.</HI> Therfore saith <HI>Salomon. <HI>Trust in</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 3.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord with al thine heart, and leane not to thine own wisedome: in al thy wayes ac∣knowledge him, and hee shal direct thy do∣ings.</HI> This counsel also doth <HI>Moses</HI> giue, <HI>Take heed that ye do as the Lord your God hath</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 5.</NOTE> <HI>commanded you: turne not aside to the right hand, nor to the left.</HI></P>
<P>But the true and godly zeale proceedeth not from hypocrisie or intention, but is led and trai∣ned by vnderstanding, and is moulten into the heart, and the vehemency and heat of it, no man knoweth, but he that feeleth it. It taketh away the vse of reason, it eateth and deuoureth vp the heart: euen as the thing that is eaten, is turned into the substance of him that eateth it: and as iron whiles it is burning hot is turned into the nature of the fire: so great and so iust is the griefe that they which haue this zeale conceiue, when they see Gods house spoyled, or his holye name dishonoured. So saith <HI>Elias, I haue been very ielous for y<SUP>•</SUP> Lord God of hosts: for the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 19.</NOTE> <HI>childrē of Israel haue forsaken thy couenāt, broken down thine altars, &amp; slaine thy Pro∣phets with the sword, &amp; I onely am left, and they seeke my life to take it away.</HI> So when <HI>Moses</HI> found that the people had forsaken God, and were fallen down before a moulten calfe, &amp; did put their trust in the woorke of their owne hāds, <HI>his wrath waxed hot, &amp; he cast the ta∣bles</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 32.</NOTE>
<PB REF="68"/>
<HI>out of his hād, &amp; brake them in pieces beneath the mountaine.</HI> His heart was so in∣flamed with zeale, that he considered not what he had in his hande, nor what hee did. <HI>Ieremy,</HI> when he sawe the disorder of the people, and howe they were not mended with his prea∣ching, and woulde inwardly conceale the griefe he conceiued, and purposed not to make menti∣on of the Lorde, nor to speake any more in his name: yet could he not, for his zeale found way, and brake out, <HI>His word</HI> (saith he) <HI>was in mine</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 20.</NOTE> <HI>heart as a burning fire shut vp in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, &amp; I could not stay.</HI></P>
<P>And, albeit there is much likenesse between the rage and fury of hypocrites, and the godlye zeale of good men: for either are hot, either are vehement, either wisheth redresse: yet this is an euidēt differēce: godly zeale is tempered &amp; sea∣soned with charity, the vngodly is ioyned with bitternes &amp; reuenge: y<SUP>e</SUP> godly seeketh to winne, the vngodly to kill and to destroy. The vngod∣ly haue their handes full of blood, they kill the Prophets, they say, We haue a lawe, and by our lawe he must die. They say, Come, let vs de∣stroy them, that they be no more a nation.</P>
<P>Let not the name of Israel be had any more in remembrance. They burne the holy bookes of the Scriptures, as did <HI>Aza</HI> and <HI>Antiochus.</HI> They saye, ransake it, pull it downe, case it to
<PB REF="69"/>
the foundation, let nor one bee left aliue. They digge vp the bodies of the dead, out of their graues. They shewe their cruelty vppon the bones and ashes, which were long before bury∣ed, and well nigh consumed. It grieueth them when they lacke vppon whome they may whet their blood thyrstie and cruell zeale. It grie∣ueth them, no one thing else so much, that they did not woorke surely, and cut vp the roote. Such is the zeale of the vngodly. Euen such a zeale as was in <HI>Nero,</HI> in <HI>Caligula,</HI> of whom it is reported, he wished that all the Romaines had but one necke, that he might cut off all their beades at one stroke: as was in <HI>Herode,</HI> in <HI>Annas.</HI> and <HI>Catphas,</HI> and the like murthe∣rers.</P>
<P>But the Godly, when they see any disorder, they doe nothing like the other: they mourne in their heartes to see that the trueth is not re∣reyued, and to see the mindes of their brethren so obstinately hardened: they make prayer to God for them: they are deepely touched with the feeling of suche calamittes whiche GOD layeth vppon other. The zeale of Moses coulde not like the Idolatrie of the people: yet hee went vnto the Lorde againe, and sayde, <HI>Nowe if thou pardon their sinne, thy mer∣cie shall appeare: but if thou wilte not,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 3▪</NOTE> <HI>I praye thee rase mee out of thy Booke which thou hast written.</HI> Christ lamented

<P>So Christ, when he sawe the temple of God fowly and vnseemely abused: that they made the holy place, a place for their vnlawfull and vnha∣nest game by vsurie: that they turned Religion into robberie, solde oxen, sheepe, and doues, and keept their bankes for exchaunge in the temple: when the Priestes and <HI>Leuites,</HI> whiche shoulde serue God, were become marchantes, and ser∣ued them selues: when the temple or house of God, which <HI>Dauid</HI> purposed, and <HI>Salomon</HI> fi∣nished, and <HI>Ezechias</HI> and <HI>Esras,</HI> and other God∣ly Princes preserued, in whiche was kept the booke of the Law, whether al the people assem∣bled together to serue God, was not vsed lyke gods house, but like a common faire or market, and was made a denne of theiues: When these grosse abuses were suffered, and things were let runne to such extremities, and al this vnder pre∣tence of holines, as if it were not onely lawfull,

but needes it must be so: moued with zeale, hee coulde not abide it. <HI>He made a scourge of smal cordes, &amp; droue them all out of the temple,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>and poured out the changers mony, and o∣uerthrew the tables, &amp; saide, make not my fathers house a house of marchādise. And his disciples remembred that it was writtē, the zeale of thine house hath eaten me vp.</HI> This was no frantique or melancholy passion, nei∣ther in <HI>Moses,</HI> nor in <HI>Dauid,</HI> nor in <HI>Christ. Mo∣ses</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 12.</NOTE> <HI>was a very meeke mā aboue al that were on the earth. Dauid</HI> was a man that heareth not, and in whose mouthe are no reproofes. And Christ sayde, learne of me, for I am humble and meeke. When his disciples <HI>Iames &amp; Iohn,</HI> grewe wrothfull against the <HI>Samaritanes</HI> that would not receiue hym, and sayde, <HI>Lord, wylte</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 9.</NOTE> <HI>thou that wee commaunde that fire come downe from heauen, &amp; consume them, euen as Elias did?

Al men ought to bee pacient &amp; gentle in matters appertayninge to them selues: but in Gods cause, no man must yeelde or bee pa∣tient.</P>
<P>In our dayes, vppon whom the ende of the
<PB REF="71"/>
worlde is come, when wee did lately see those times, wher of our sauiour foretolde so longe s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣theuce, that desolatiō should be in the holy place, and such confusion, ignorance, and blindenes, that men shoulde stomble at noone dayes, that truth should be a stranger vpon earth, that men should forsake wholsome doctrine, and giue eare vnto fables, that the mysterie of iniquitie should work, and the very elect (if it were possible) bee deceiued, what trial was made of true &amp; godlye zeale: How notably did it shew it selfe agaynst the rage and furie of the wicked: What should I speake hereof: The exāples are fresh, you can not forget them you hearde of them so late, it is so late since you did beholde them. What mo∣ued so many, so learned, so vertuous, to yeelde their backes to the scourge, their neckes to the tormentours, their bodies to the fire, to forsake their goodes, their friends, their parentes, their wiues and childrē, but the zeale of Gods house: Neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor thinges present, nor things to come was able to separate them from the loue of God. They continued stedfast vnto the ende: the zeale of Gods house dyd eate them vp.</P>
<P>But now God hath restored vs, he hath taken away the desolation from vs, hee hath giuen vs his trueth, he hath reuealed the man of sinne, he hath raysed vp a banner of hope. We se and en∣ioye such thinges as many kings, and Prophets
<PB REF="71"/>
would haue eniayed, and could not. What re∣mayneth, but that we take the zeale of the Lords house into our heartes, and seeke by all meanes the glory of the same: As our good fathers and brethren shewed the vehemencie of their loue in disly king the disorders which troubled y<SUP>e</SUP> church of God: so in this blessed peace which God gi∣ueth to his Church, let vs witnesse our earneste zeale in seeking that it may be made beautifull, and established for euer.</P>
<P>Let our next care be to continue possession. Kingdomes are preserued by the same meanes, by which they were first gotten. That which is conquered by zeale, by carefull zeale must bee kept. It was saide of <HI>Annibal,</HI> that he knew how to get the victorie, but howe to vse it, bee knew not. Many haue lost that by negligence, which they had by diligence wonne. Therefore we ought, as our heartes were careful, and desi∣rous to see these dayes: so by our thankefulnes to God for so great blessinge, and by Christian and Godlye prouidence foresee such meanes, whereby wee may longe hereafter enioye the same. Whē <HI>Phydias</HI> had made the pourtraiture of <HI>Iupiter Pisanus,</HI> he ouerlayed it with oyle, y<SUP>t</SUP> it might continue fresh and greene, and neuer putrifie. When God gaue order to <HI>Noah</HI> for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 6.</NOTE> making the Arke, he saide, <HI>Thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitche,</HI> that it might be sound, and sure, &amp; abide the waues.</P>
<P><PB REF="72"/>
He, which chalengeth to himselfe, that proude and wanton name, to be called the head of y<SUP>e</SUP> vni∣uersal church, after by litle &amp; litle he was gotten into possessiō, was not behind hand by al meanes to maintaine &amp; keepe the same. In this policie, he tooke away the reading of the scriptures frō the people: he made noble men &amp; princes his Cardinals. He threw downe, &amp; set vp, &amp; changed whom, &amp; what he would. The kings &amp; states of the world, y<SUP>e</SUP> bishops, professors &amp; schollers in vni¦uersities, &amp; preachers were brought to swere al∣legeāce &amp; obedience vnto him. I deuise not this, the stories hereof are abrode, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> oth which they tooke is known. His authorite grew greater thē the authoritie of general councilles. Nothing might be decreed in councels, but what pleased him: none might be admitted to speak in coūcils, but such as were sworne to him. He had al law in his breast. There was sometimes a proclama∣tion made in <HI>Rome,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> for considerations no man should erect or builde vp any theater: &amp; that if a∣ny were set vp, it shold be rased, &amp; pulled down. <HI>Pompeius</HI> a gentleman of great wealth, &amp; noble courage, did build a theater, such a one as before had not bene seene, which would receaue 2500. men, contrary to y<SUP>e</SUP> proclamation, &amp; order taken. But, dubtinge least the next maiestrates should destroy it, he caused a place of religion to bee set vpon it, &amp; called it the tēple of <HI>Venus.</HI> Whereby he prouided, y<SUP>t</SUP> if any wold ouerthrow it, because
<PB REF="72"/>
it was a Theater, they might yet spare it for the temples sake: for to pul down a tēple was sacri∣lege. Euen so, there haue bene proclamations, &amp; cannons, y<SUP>t</SUP> no man shoulde be called y<SUP>e</SUP> chiefe, or y<SUP>e</SUP> head of al Churches, or vsurpe such authoritie o∣uer others: but when y<SUP>e</SUP> Pope built vp his supre∣macie against the meaning of suche canons, hee pretēded religiō for his doing: he sayde, it was <HI>de iure diuino,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> no man should presume or attēpt a∣gaīst it, &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> so his power might cōtinue for euer.</P>
<P>If they haue bene thus carefull to mainteine falshod, how much more careful should we be to maintaine y<SUP>e</SUP> truth: If they to aduāce their owne kingdome, how much more wee, to set forth the kingdom of God, &amp; to builde vp the Church of Christ: And if they sought to do y<SUP>t</SUP> by lies, &amp; by false meanes, why should we bee slack to vse the right, &amp; true, &amp; good meanes, wherby that good thing which God hath wrought for vs, may bee established:</P>
<P>And, albeit there be many wayes, by which the kingdome of God may be mainteined: as the fa∣uour &amp; countenance of y<SUP>e</SUP> prince, whiche so cōfor∣teth &amp; cherisheth y<SUP>e</SUP> Church, as the sunne beames cōfort &amp; cherish the earth: &amp; knowledge, &amp; lear∣ning, &amp; discipline, which are as the life, &amp; the si∣nues, &amp; without which the Church must needes fall asunder: at this time, I wil leaue to speak of the rest, &amp; only stay vpon learninge, which may truly be called y<SUP>e</SUP> life or y<SUP>e</SUP> soule of y<SUP>e</SUP> Church, &amp; of christian religien.</P>
<P><PB REF="73"/>
How necessarie a thinge, they haue counted learninge to the settinge foorth of Religion, the stories of our old fathers, of heathens, and Chri∣stians in al ages, doe witnesse. They thought, that neither Religion might stande without knowledge, nor knowledge were to bee estee∣med without Religion. <HI>Charles</HI> the great, that hee might the better plant Religion in <HI>Saxonie</HI> and <HI>Heluetia,</HI> did erect many places for en∣crease of learning. He knewe well, that there was no other way better to establish Religion. The Cathedral Churches, before such times, as ignoraunce and blindenesse grewe ouer all the worlde, and brought in an vniuersal corruption, maintayned schooles of learning, that the doc∣trine which was taught in those places, might bee defended agaynst the gaynesayers by suche learned men, as were there bred vp. The Prin∣ces of Germanie, and the free Cities, after they had receyued the Gospell, they dissolued theyr monasteries which had bene harbourers for such as liued in idlenes, and set vp Schooles and col∣ledges, which should be nourceries to breede vp learned men, that might bee able to teache the people, and to maintaine religion. Whereby it came to passe, that in shorte time they had great store of worthy and learned men.</P>
<P>This did they wel see, that haue bene the e∣nemies of religion, &amp; therefore vsed all meanes to hinder the encrease of learninge, that they
<PB REF="73"/>
might haue the better way to ouerthrow Reli∣gion. For if learning decay, it is likely that Re∣ligion can not abide. Beare with me, if I speake that whiche may seeme more fitt for some other place, then for this audience: the best here vnder∣standeth me wel. In other countries, the recei∣uing of the Gospell, hath alwayes bene cause, that learning was more set by: and learninge hath euer bene the furtherance of the Gospell. In England, I knowe not how, it commethe otherwise to passe. For since the Gospell hath bene receiued, the maintenaunce for learninge hath bene decayed. And, the lacke of learninge will be the decay of the Gospel. Would God it were not so: or, that yet before the faulte be in∣curable, there may be some redresse.</P>
<P>Loth I am to speake, yet the case so requi∣reth, that it is needefull to be spoken, I truste I shall speak in the hearing of them that wyll con∣fider it. Maintenance of learninge, whereby an able and sufficient ministerie may growe, and be established in al the Churches of this realme, is to be wished for. The good estate of this no∣ble kingdome, y<SUP>•</SUP> comfort of posterytie, y<SUP>•</SUP> staye of Religion, the continuing of the Gospell, the re∣mouing of darknes hangeth vpon it. One as∣ked sometimes, howe it was that in <HI>Athens</HI> so goodly and great a citie, there were no Phisi∣tians, To whom this answere was made, be∣cause there are rewardes appointed for them
<PB REF="74"/>
that practise Phisicke. The same answere may be made for our times: the cause why y<SUP>•</SUP> Church of God is so forsaken, is the want of zeale in thē that should either for their curtesie, or for their ability be fosterers of learning, &amp; encrease the liuings where occasion is, and giue hope &amp; con∣fort to learned men. What said I, increase<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nay, the liuings and prouision which hertofore were giuen to this vse, are taken away.</P>
<P>Haue patience, if any such be here, as I well know there are, whom these things touch. Suf∣fer me to speake the truth, it is Gods cause. The liuings of such as are in the ministery, are not in their handes, to whom they are due. Al other la∣bourers and artificers haue their hire increased double, as much as it was wont to be: Onely the poore man that laboureth, &amp; sweateth in the vineyard of the Lorde of hostes, hath his hire a∣bridged &amp; abated. I speak not of the Curats, but of Personages &amp; Uicarages, that is, of the pla∣ces which are the castles &amp; towers of fence for the Lordes temple. They seldome passe now a dayes from the patrone, if he be no better then a gentleman, but either for the lease or for present money. Such marchāts are brokē into y<SUP>•</SUP> church of God, a great deale more intolerable thē were they whō Christ chased &amp; whipt out of y<SUP>•</SUP> tēple. Thus they y<SUP>•</SUP> should be careful for Gods church, that should be patrones, to prouide for y<SUP>•</SUP> consciē∣ces of the people, &amp; to place amōg thē a learned
<PB REF="74"/>
Minister, who might bee able to preach y<SUP>•</SUP> worde vnto thē out of season, &amp; in season, &amp; to fulfil his ministerie: seeke their own, &amp; not y<SUP>•</SUP> which is Ie∣sus Christs. They serue not Iesus Christ, but their bellie. And this is done, not in one place, or in one countrie, but throughout England. A gentlemā cannot keepe his house, vnles he haue a Parsonage or two in ferme for his prouision.</P>
<P>O mercifull God, wherto will this growe at last? If the miserie which this plague worketh, would reache but to one age, it were tolerable. But it wil be a plague to the posteritie, it wilbe the decay &amp; desolation of Gods Church. Yong men which are toward &amp; learned, see this. They see that he whiche feedeth the flocke, hath least part of the milke: hee which goeth a warfare, hath not halfe his wages. Therefore they are weary and discouraged, they chaunge their stu∣dies: some become prentises, some turne to phi∣sick, some to lawe: all shun and flee the Mini∣sterie. And besides the hinderance that thus groweth by wicked dealing of patrons: by rea∣son of the impropriations, the Uicarages in many places, &amp; in the properest market townes, are so simple, that no man can liue vpon them, and therefore no man wyll take them. They were wont to saye, <HI>Beneficia sine cura: Bene∣nefices without charge:</HI> but now may be said, <HI>Cura sine beneficio, Charge or cure without benefice.</HI>
<PB REF="75"/>
I speake not this of my selfe: many here present know I speake the trueth. And my selfe know the places, which haue continued styll these ma∣ny yeares without a Minister resident amonge them, and haue prouided them selues, as they might, with their owne mony.</P>
<P>Your Graces subiects had hope of amende∣ment, in your graces late visitation. But yet it standeth stil in case as miserable, as it did before. I know, your grace heareth not of these mat∣ters. And I hope God wyll worke in your gra∣cious heart, to prouide some remedy agaynste them. For otherwise, the scholes wil be forsakē, the Church desolate, the people wylde and dis∣mayed, the Gospel discredited: otherwise, wee shal see that wrought against the house of God, that neuer any <HI>Ieroboam,</HI> or <HI>Iulian,</HI> or <HI>Licinius,</HI> could haue brought to passe against vs. This noble Realme which euer was famous for the name of learninge, is like thereby to come to such ignorance, and barbarie, as hath not beene heard of in any memorie before our time.</P>
<P>I knowe that there are grieuous com∣plaintes made, that the Bishops appoint Priests and Ministers, that are ignoraunt and haue no vnderstanding in the latine tongue. Woulde God it were not true. Or would God that they which be the causers hereof, woulde somewhat helpe to amēd it. But alas, are we able to make learned men vpon the sudden? Or can we make
<PB REF="75"/>
others then come vnto vs, or wyll come to liue in miserie?</P>
<P>But there are many which can say, such as bee ministers in the Churche, shoulde teache freely, without hope of recompence or hire for their la∣bour. Our preachers are no better then <HI>Peter</HI> &amp; <HI>Paul,</HI> &amp; the other Apostles. They are no better then the holy prophets, who liued poorely. Po∣uertie is a cōmendable estate. So say some, in lyke deuotion as did Iudas, <HI>What needed this wast? this might haue bene sold for much &amp; giuen to the pore: not that he cared for the pore, but because he was a thiefe, &amp; had the bag, &amp; bare y<SUP>t</SUP> which was giuen.</HI> I doubt not, there are many which teach Christ for Christes sake, which say in their soule, y<SUP>e</SUP> Lord is my por∣tion: who in that heauy time, from which God deliuered thē, if they might haue receiued theyr life only for a recōpence, would haue bin glad to take the paines: who seeke you and not yours: which haue forsaken all they had, to followe Christ. I doubt not, there are such.</P>
<P>But for y<SUP>t</SUP> hope of posteritie, I report me to al you which are fathers, &amp; haue childrē for whom you are carefull. Although your selues haue a zeale, &amp; a care for the house of god: yet wil you breed them vp, keepe them at schoole, vntil 24. yeeres old to your charges, that in the ende they may liue in glorious pouertie? y<SUP>t</SUP> they may liue poorely &amp; naked like the Prophets &amp; Apostles &amp;
<PB REF="76"/>
Our posteritie shall rue, that euer such fathers went before them: And Chronicles shal report this contempt of learning amonge the punish∣ments, and murraines, and other plagues of God. They shall leaue it written in what time, and vnder whose raygne this was done. Or if we growe so barbarous that wee consider not this, or bee not able to drawe it into Chronicle, yet forraine nations wyl not spare to write this, and publish it to our euerlastinge reproche and shame.</P>
<P>In the meane time, what may bee ghessed of their meaning, which thus rauine and spoyle the house of God, which decay the prouision therof, and so basely esteeme the Ministers of his Gos∣pel? They can not say to God, the zeale of thy house hath eaten me vp. Howsoeuer in other thinges they doe wel, howsoeuer they seeme to reioyce at the prosperitie of <HI>Sion,</HI> and to seeke the safetie and preseruation of the Lordes a∣noy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted: yet needes must it bee, that by these meanes forraine power, of which this realme by the mercie of God is happely delyuered, shall agayne be brought in vpon vs. Suche thinges shalbe done vnto vs, as we before suffered: the truth of God shalbe taken away, the holy scrip∣tures burnt and consumed in fire. A marueilous darknesse and calamitie must needes ensue. For if the tempest be so darke in the sea that the load starre lose her light, and the needle fayle to giue
<PB REF="76"/>
token of the North Pole, no marueile though the Ship lose her course, and be swallowed vp in the sandes.</P>
<P>The Gospell of Christe is the fountaine of light, and of knowledge. It cannot be maintei∣ned by ignorance and darknes. These, bee the proppes of their kingdome which take away y<SUP>e</SUP> scriptures, which hold the people in blindenes, which flie the light, whiche haue their common prayers, minister the Sacraments, Mary, burie their dead in a strange tongue, that the People may vnderstand nothing: which make a famine of hearing the word of God: which stop vp the springes of the water of lyfe: which take awaye the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, and neither enter in them selues, nor suffer them that woulde enter: which say ignoraunce is the mother of deuotion, &amp; the Church is then in best order, &amp; the people most deuoute, when they are hood winckt, &amp; blinded, &amp; see nothing.</P>
<P>These are not fit instrumēts, wherwith we may ouercome the aduersaries. This is not y<SUP>e</SUP> sworde of the spirit, these are not the spiritual weapons, which cast downe holdes, and euery high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God What man that would keepe out his enemy, will pul downe his holdes? what captaine that meaneth to giue a forcible assault vpon the ene∣my, will discourage his fighting souldiers? but our souldiers are out of courage, our Castles
<PB REF="77"/>
are falling: therefore that which we feare wyll fall vpon vs,</P>
<P>The oxe that treadeth out the corne is musse∣led. He that goeth a warrefare, receiueth not his wages: the crye hereof goeth vp into the eares of the Lord of Hostes. He wil not abide so great contempt of his worde, and preachers: his owne name is therby dishonoured. Our sauiour saith, <HI>He that dispiseth you, dispiseth mee.</HI> And <HI>S. Paul, He</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>despiseth these thinges, despiseth</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 10. 1. Thes. 4.</NOTE> <HI>not man but god.</HI> And think we, that hee wyll suffer his holy name to be despised? Nay, hys wrath is alreadie kindled. He hath already begū his iudgements, &amp; therfore many places are left desolate. There is none that can warne them of their sinne, none that can moue them to repen∣tance, none that can preach vnto them forgeue∣nes through Christ, none that can instruct them in the comfort of euerlasting life. Because they worke such thinges against the Lord, the hearts of many are astonied. Though they heare, they vnderstande not. They scorne and ieste at the worde of saluation: it is vnto them a sauour of death vnto death: they are earthlye minded, whose God is their bellie, and whose glorie is to their shame.</P>
<P>For this cause you liue still in your sinnes, in adulterie, in couetousues, and in pride, without any feeling of conscience, without any feare of God. Your daughters, your heires, to whom
<PB REF="77"/>
you shall leaue your landes, are stollen awaye from you, Robberies and theft are so common, as if it were not onely lawful, but also commen∣dable: as if sinne were no sinne, and he I fire but a fable.</P>
<P>Thus wee prouoke God to anger. Manye walke, of whom wee cannot thinke but with weeping: they are the enemies of the crosse of Christ: the name of God is blasphemed through them. Many are so ignoraunt, they knowe not what the Scriptures are, they knowe not that there are any Scriptures. They call them he∣reticall, and newe doctrine. Many will beleeue neyther side, whatsoeuer they alleadge. Bring they trueth, bring they falshoode: teache they Christ, teach they Antichrist: they will beleeue neither, they haue so hardened their heartes. Be the Preacher rough or gentle, learned or vn∣learned, let him vse authority of the scriptures, of the doctours, of the councels, of Decrees or Decretalles, of Gods Lawe, of mans law, no∣thing wil moue them, nothing wil please them, because the ministery of God, and there by God himselfe, is despised.</P>
<P>These woordes happily seeme sharpe, and ouer vehement: but the hardnesse of our hearts against GOD, and the lacke of zeale of his house, inforce me to them. We are almost fallen into the lowest pitte: we are left without zeale, as senselesse men, and as if we had cleane for∣gotten
<PB REF="78"/>
our selues, as the Heathen which know not God. Therefore, vnlesse we repent, the kingdome of God shall be taken away from vs. He will send vppon this land a famine of the woorde. Hierusalem shall be ouerthrown, and made an heape of stones, the man of sinne, and they which haue not the loue of the trueth shall preuayle with many, and withdraw them from obedience to the Prince: this noble realme shall be subiect to foreine nations: all this will the zeale of the Lorde of hostes bring to passe.</P>
<P>I could haue spent this time in opening some other matter: but nothing in my iudgement is more worthy your good consideration, and spee∣dy redresse. I would be loth rashly or rudely to abuse the reuerence of this place: but vnles these things be cared for, vnlesse we shew foorth grea∣ter zeale then hitherto, if the yeeres to come eate vp and take awaye from the Ministery as the late yeeres haue done, there wil not be left with∣in a while, any to speake the word of God out of this place. The Pulpits shall haue none to vse them: the people shal grow wyld and voyd of vnderstanding.</P>
<P>When <HI>Xerxes</HI> behelde the greate company of his Souldiers, suddenly he brake into teares, and wept bitterly. One sayde to him, O Syr, you haue cause to reioyce, you haue a goodlye companie, they are able to fight for you agaynst
<PB REF="78"/>
any nation. But what shall become of them, saith <HI>Xerxes?</HI> after a hundred yeeres: not one of all these shall be left aliue. If the view of the smal number of Preachers might be taken, how fewe they are, and howe thinne they come vp, we haue greater cause then <HI>Xerxes</HI> to lament, if we haue any zeale to the house of GOD. For, of the Preachers which nowe are, within fewe yeeres none will remayne aliue. And <HI>Xerxes</HI> souldiers lefte issue behinde them, which might afterwardes serue their Countrey: But there is like to bee small increase for the supplie of Learned men. The Lorde shall lacke men to bring in his haruest, the little ones shall call for bread, and there shall be none to giue it them. They that shall come after vs, shall see this to bee true. There is no house so spoyled, as the House of the LORD. There is no Seruaunt so little rewarded as the Seruaunt of Christ, and the disposer of the mysteries of God.</P>
<P>Oh that your Grace did beholde the misera∣ble disorder of Gods Church, or that you might foresee the calamities, which will follow. It is a part of your kingdome, &amp; such a parte, as is the principall proppe and stay of the rest. I wil say to your Maiesty, as <HI>Cyrillus</HI> sometimes saide to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciril. epist. ad Theod. &amp; Va∣len.</NOTE> to the godly Emperor <HI>Theodosius</HI> &amp; <HI>Valētiniā, Abea quae erga Deum est pietate, reipublicae,

vestrae status pendet: The good estate &amp; wel∣fare of your common wealth hangeth vpon true godlinesse.</HI> You are our Gouernour, you are the Nource of Gods Church. We must o∣pen this griefe before you. God knoweth if it may be redressed, it hath growen so long, and is runne so farre. But, if it may be redressed, there is no other besides your Highnesse, that can re∣dresse it.</P>
<P>I hope I speake truly, that which I speake without flatterie, that God hath endued your Grace with such measure of learning &amp; know∣ledge, as no other Christian Prince. He hath giuen you peace, happinesse, the loue and true hearts of your subiectes. Oh turne and employ these to the glory of God, that God may cōfirm in your Grace the thing which he hath begun. To this ende hath GOD placed Kinges and Princes in their state, as Dauid saith, that they serue the Lorde, that they may see and cause o∣thers to see to the furniture of the Church. The good Emperor <HI>Iustinian</HI> cared for this as much, as for his life. <HI>Constantine, Theodosius, Valenti∣nian,</HI> &amp; other godly Princes, called themselues <HI>Vasallos,</HI> the subiects and bond seruants of God.

Your grace hath already redressed the doctrine: now cast your eyes towardes the Mi∣nisterie, giue courage &amp; countenance vnto lear∣ning, that Gods house may be serued: so shal you leaue a Church of God, &amp; a testimonie that the zeale of the Lords house hath eaten you vp.</P>
<P>And you, O dearely beloued, if there be any such which are neither hot nor colde, which doe the work of the Lord negligently, which esteem the word of GOD but as a matter of pollicie, which are ashamed to bee called Professours of the Gospel of Christ, pray vnto God that he wil increase your zeale. Let vs continue rooted and built in Christ, and stablished in the faith. Let vs haue care for the house of God. Whosoeuer is not after this sort zealous, is a man of a double heart. We may not halt between two opinions. If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal be he, then go after him: he that is not with Christ, is against him. Many talke of the Gospel, and glorie in their knowledge: but it is neyther talke nor knowledge whiche shal saue them in that day. He that feareth the Lorde, and serueth
<PB REF="80"/>
him with a pure heart, and may truely saye, the zeale of thine house hath consumed me, he shall be saued. If they shall not escape which haue zeale without knowledge, what shall be∣come of vs which haue knowledge without zeale:</P>
<P>And you, whosoeuer you are, that by such meanes haue decayed the Lordes House, and abridged the prouision and maintenaunce there∣of, and see the miserable wracke of Gods Churche: if there be any zeale of God in you, if you haue any felowshippe of the spirite, if any compassion and mercy, if you loue God, if you desire the continuance of the Gospel, oh remem∣ber you haue the patrimonie due vnto them that shoulde attend in the Lordes house: you take vnto your selues wrongfully, that which was not lotted for you. Giue vnto <HI>Caesar</HI> those things which belong to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and vnto GOD the thinges which appertaine to him, and make for the beauty and furniture of his house. En∣rich your selues by lawfull meanes, and with∣out the spoyle and waste of Gods Church. Let not the Ministery by your meanes be despised. You enriched them, which mocked, &amp; blinded, &amp; deuoured you: Spoyle not them now that feed, and instruct, and comfort you. Let vs seeke the glory of God. Let vs at length serue the Lorde and not our bellie, and greedy wantonnesse.</P>
<P>So shal God blesse you and prosper you in al
<PB REF="80"/>
your affaires, so shal he strike a terrour of you into all forreine Princes that dwell about you, so shall your heart be kept stedfast in the hande of God, so shal your heart be perfect before the Lorde, so shall you leaue suche as shall alwayes praise the Lorde in Sion, so shall you see your childrens children, and peace vpon Israel.</P>
<P>And, thou O most mercifull Father, graunt that thy wordes be not spoken in vayne: it is thy cause. Thou art our father, we are as claye in thine handes. Thou hast the key of our hearts: Giue zeale to them that haue knowledge, giue knowledge to them that haue zeale, that they may be inflamed and rauished with the loue of thy house, to sorrow for the decay thereof, and to doe al their indeuour to build vp and establish the same for euer,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Hrist our Sauiour, after he was baptized by Iohn &amp; tēp∣ted by Satan in the wilder∣nes, began to execute y<SUP>•</SUP> Cō∣mission wherunto his father had sent him, chose vnto him self a number of disciples to be at his commandement, and so tooke his pro∣gresse through a great part of the Countrey. In the meane way, in euery place where he came, he taught the people that the kingdome of God was come amongst them: he healed their disea∣ses: wrought straunge miracles before their eies: and gaue manye singular and euident to∣kens of his comming.</P>
<P>But specially, he behelde in what state the poore people stood, touching their readines in receiuing Gods truth, in al the countrey where he had byn: &amp; therfore at the end of his circuite, he was moued w<SUP>t</SUP> pity, &amp; said, he saw thē in most woful case, forsaken and lost, as if they had byn
<PB REF="81"/>
a flocke of sheepe without a heard: and that not through their owne malice, but through the wil∣ful blindnesse and negligence of them that were set to guide them.</P>
<P>Sheepe (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> write of them) are a simple kinde of cattell, profitable to many vses, ready to receiue all maner wrongs, without skil, to helpe or succour it selfe: it coue∣teth to breake out of the folde or close, if it may espie any hole open, it strayeth and wandreth a∣broade, many times hangeth in the briers, many times is taken vp by the Wolfe: it is euer in dā∣ger of the wynd &amp; rayne, yea, of the very grasse and water it liueth by, and thereof is infected of∣tentimes with a number of maladies: so that the health and safety of the sheepe, resteth only in the care and diligence of the shephearde. To such a kind of cattel are the people likened.</P>
<P>Christ saith not, they were like vnruly sheep, that would not be guided by their heard: but he saith. They were like poore lost sheep, that had no heard at al. For, the people of thēselues were not vnwilling to receiue the Gospel: but there was none to instruct them. And for that, he ad∣deth an other similitude, to declare the same, and saith, The haruest indeed is great, but the work∣men are but few: the corne is ripe, &amp; ready to be cut, but there lack hands to fetch it in.</P>
<P>The comming of these times was promised long afore, euen from the first creation of man∣kinde,
<PB REF="82"/>
but the perfourmance thereof at the first was darke, and as it were wrapt vp, and hid in a cloude, and like corne buried in the ground.</P>
<P>After, it was somewhat more cleerely set forth in the Law giuen by <HI>Moses.</HI> After that, it was reuiued by the Prophetes, and in manner plainely, in what place, at what time, of what mother, of what house or stocke Christ should be borne: what doctrine he should teach, what mi∣racles he should worke, what death he shoulde die, how he should be buried, howe he shoulde arise, how he should ascend into heauen, howe the heathens shoulde be called to beleeue in him, howe the holy Ghost should be sent, and to con∣clude, how Christ should come at the last, to iudge the world. After that came <HI>Saint Iohn</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> to point out <HI>Christ</HI> plainely with his fin∣ger, and to say, <HI>Ecce agnus Dei, qui tollit pecca∣ta mundi, Behold the lambe of God, that ta∣keth away the sinnes of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Last of al, Christe himselfe began to preache and prophecie of himselfe, and to gather vnto him a chosen people, that should be followers of good woorkes. Then was the accomplishment and fulnesse of time come to passe, that had so long beene looked for: then the kingdome of God began to suffer violence, and men violent∣ly euen by force, brake in vpon it: then the corne sowed and cast into the ground by the patriarks long before, and watered &amp; cherished by the dew
<PB REF="82"/>
of the Prophets, was ripened and kerned by the spirit of God: then was the haruest greate, and the eares white, euen ready to be cut.</P>
<P>Yet this notwithstanding, Christ saith, the haruest men are but few. He saith not, the Har∣uest is great, and there are but few <HI>Scribes,</HI> but few <HI>Pharisies,</HI> but few <HI>Sadduces,</HI> but few priests, but few Leuites: For the Priests and Leuites were distributed through y<SUP>e</SUP> whole countrey. In euery litle Towne or borough there was a col∣ledge, &amp; as one of their <HI>Rabbines</HI> recordeth, in y<SUP>•</SUP> city of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> there were no lesse then 400 schooles: so that the number was almost infinit.</P>
<P>Moreouer, they vsed commonly to say, as it is reported by the Prophet <HI>leremie, Non peribit</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Lex a sacerdote, nec consilium a sapiente, nec ser∣mo a Propheta. It cannot be that the true vn∣derstanding of the Law should be taken frō the Priest, nor good counsel frō the wise, nor the word from the Prophet.</HI> They read &amp; ex∣pounded the Law to the people euery day: they had their daily sacrifice, and whēsoeuer the oxe, or calfe, or sheep, or goate was slaine, and offered vnto God, as then the maner was, the priest for his share had the breastlet that couered the heart, in token, as <HI>Origen</HI> writeth, that the Priest should be a man of counsel. He had also appoin∣ted to him the right shoulder, and the tongue, in token that he should be prompt &amp; ready in good works, and eloquent to declare the law of God.</P>
<P><PB REF="83"/>
The Bishop had euermore before his breast a tablet, wherein was imbrodered in letters of Golde, <HI>Vrim</HI> and <HI>Thumim:</HI> in token that he should be a man both perfect in life, and also full and plenteous in the truth of God. In the same were set twelue stones, and therein grauen the names of the twelue tribes of the people, that he might haue thē euermore in remembrance. The skirtes or hemmes of his roabes were set with belles of gold, and pomegranates: in token that his life should giue a good sauour, and his voice should ring, and be heard among the people.</P>
<P>The Pharisies had certaine special poynts, and sentences of the Lawe written round about in the borders of their garmentes, that it might neuer be out of their eyes: they prayed, no men more, and that in euery corner of the streetes: they fasted twise euery weeke: the bed that they laye vpon, as <HI>Epiphanius</HI> writeth, was but a spanne broade, &amp; yet, that they might sleepe with lesse ease, they strowed thornes vnderneath thē. Briefly, all their life in appearance was such, &amp; al their apparel and behauiour so seemely and decent, that if a man would paint out wisedom, sobrietie, and perfect holinesse, he could haue no better patterne. And therfore they were called <HI>Pharisaei,</HI> that is, <HI>diuided,</HI> as men in holines &amp; perfection of life farre passing al the rest of the people.</P>
<P>Yet for al this, notwithstanding their greate
<PB REF="83"/>
shewe of wisedome, of learning, of perfection of life, &amp; the great multitude of them, Chrst sayeth there were few workmen to goe to the haruest. For, <HI>They did prophecie out of their owne</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 13.</NOTE> <HI>harts, they did not rise vp in the gappes, nor made vp the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battell in the day of the Lorde: they haue seene vanity, &amp; lying diuination, saying, the Lord saith it, &amp; the lord hath not sent thē: &amp; they haue made others to hope that they would confirm the words of their prophecie,</HI> saith <HI>Ezechiel.</HI></P>
<P>No, contrariwise, these that should haue been the chiefe haruest men, were the wasters and de∣stroyers of the haruest, <HI>My people</HI> (saith God) <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 50.</NOTE> <HI>hath byn as lost sheep: their shepherds haue caused thē to go astray, &amp; haue turned them away to the mountaines.</HI> Christe telleh the <HI>Pharisies,</HI> they haue made his fathers house a denne of theeues. He speaketh thus of them. <HI>All</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 10.</NOTE> <HI>that euer came before mee, are theeues and robbers.</HI> Notwithstanding their stout learning and shew of holinesse, they were nothing els but theeues &amp; robbers: they did robbe mens soules, chey stale the sheepe out of the fold, they spoyled God of his glory.</P>
<P>When they sawe the people followe thicke after Christ, and to haue him in reuerence, they cried out, none of the Princes and great holye learned men beleeue in him, but these Rascals,
<PB REF="84"/>
that thus runne after him, are accursed, &amp; igno∣rant, and know not the law. The vnlearned sort said of Christ, he casteth out vncleane spirits by y<SUP>•</SUP> power of God: y<SUP>•</SUP> great learned men said, no, he throweth out diuels by y<SUP>•</SUP> power of <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> prince of y<SUP>•</SUP> diuels. The vnlearned marueiled, &amp; were astonied at y<SUP>•</SUP> wonderful works that he did: the learned saide, he hath a diuel, he is out of his wittes. The vnlearned said, no doubt a great Prophet is risen amongst vs: the learned sayd, He deceiueth the people. The vnlearned sayde, God hath visited, and sent comfort amongst his people: the learned said, Behold a glutton and a companion of <HI>Publicans</HI> &amp; sinners. The great learned shepherds persecuted Christ, &amp; chased him from place to place: the poore sheepe folow∣ed him into the desert. They that were the guy∣ders of the flocke, crucified Christ, and shed his blood: the poore flocke set their whole affiance in his death, &amp; so dranke his blood to the reliefe of their soules, they beleeued in him, they knew the time of their visitation.</P>
<P>And therefore, notwithstanding there were grosse &amp; damnable errours amongst the people, as wel as amōgst the learned: yet Christ chalen∣ged not the people for them, but only y<SUP>•</SUP> priests &amp; the Pharisies that tooke vpon them to lead the people: for that he saw the Pharisies and priests offended euē of malice, &amp; the poore people only of ignorance and simplicity. <HI>Woe be vnto you</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3.</NOTE>
<PB REF="84"/>
<HI>Scribes &amp; Pharisies, <HI>that haue taken away the keies, &amp; shut vp the kingdom of God before the people,</HI></HI> and neither wil you enter in your selues, nor suffer others that wold gladly enter.</P>
<P>But, as for the people, he had compassion on them, for that he sawe they were forsaken, and perished euen as sheepe without a heard: that they had a certaine zeale of God, although not according to knowledge: that they fell into the pitte, not of wilfull malice, but onely because they followed the blynd guydes, that fell before them: that they were Gods haruest, and lay a∣broade, and were lost, &amp; no man would take the paines to fetch them in.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Paul</HI> was not only lead away by igno∣rance, but also was a most earnest persecuter of the Church of Christ, yet was he a portion of Gods haruest. And therfore assoone as GOD had striken him downe from his horse, he knew he had done amisse, and cryed out, <HI>Lord, what</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 9.</NOTE> <HI>wilt thou that I do?</HI> and after, he writeth of him selfe, God hath had mercy, and taken me to his grace, because I knew not what I did.</P>
<P>Many there were that cried out vpon Christ, crucifie him, crucifie him: &amp; after when he hung vpon the crosse, nodded their heads vpon him, &amp; made mowes at him, &amp; did him al maner of spite &amp; vilany, &amp; yet pertayned they to Gods haruest, and afterward, as it is credible, were crucified for him, &amp; shed their blood for him themselues:</P>
<P><PB REF="85"/>
Euen so are there, euen at this time, many that of ignoraunce persecute the Gospel of Christ, &amp; as it were crucifie Christ againe: which if they felt indeede, that it were the Gospell of God, they would not so litle regard their owne salua∣tion. God make them to bee of his haruest, and send out labourers to fetch them in.</P>
<P>Whensoeuer we begin to feele a lacke with∣in our selues, and can suffer our selues to be in∣fourmed, and taught by the Spirit of God, then may we be assured God wil take vs for his har∣uest. <HI>Plato</HI> the olde Philosopher imagineth, that the god <HI>Loue</HI> was borne of the Ladie <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is to say, <HI>Madame lack or necessity.</HI> For, no man loueth a thing, before he feele himself stand in neede of it: so, loue is the Childe, and lacke or neede is the mother.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Augustine</HI> writeth of himselfe, that be∣fore he became christened, a friend of his offered him the Scripture to looke vpon: but he, after he had read a litle, because he felt in himselfe no lacke of it, he despised it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>long it from him. Afterwarde he beganne to finde much follye in himselfe, and because he could see no redresse, he fel to weeping and prayer. In the middest of his mourning and groning, he heard a voyce, <HI>Tolle, lege: tolle, lege. <HI>Take vp, and reade: take vp, &amp;</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. confes. lib. 8. cap. 12.</NOTE> <HI>read.</HI> He marueiled much what it should be. At the last, he tooke vp a booke that lay by him of <HI>Paulos</HI> Epistles, and the first wordes that he set
<PB REF="85"/>
his eies vpon, were these, <HI>Induimini dominū Ie∣sum Christū, <HI>Put ye on the Lord Iesus Christ.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>S. Hierom</HI> writing vpon the prophet, <HI>Nahum,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Nahum. cap. 3.</NOTE> saith, <HI>In aduentu Messiae, populus qui fuerat con∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pitus sub magistris, excitabitur, &amp; ibit ad mon∣tes scripturarū. <HI>What time</HI> Messias <HI>shal come, the people that were lulled a sleepe in igno∣rance by such as should haue been their tea∣chers, shal awake, and get them forth to the mountaines of the Scriptures.</HI></HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Chrisost.</HI> vpon the <HI>Genesis, Si desit mini∣sterium hominis, ipse Dominus superne illustrabit</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 30.</NOTE> <HI>mentem nostrā. <HI>If the ministery of man be wā ting, the Lord himself wil lighten our mind frō aboue.</HI></HI> And Christ in the Gospel of <HI>S. Iohn,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 10.</NOTE> saith, <HI>My sheep heare my voice, &amp; follow me, &amp; they wil not follow a stranger, but flye frō him.</HI> And to conclude, whosoeuer feeleth a lack within himself, &amp; can suffer himselfe to be infor∣med &amp; taught by the spirit of God, he may be as∣sured, God wil take him for his haruest. Thus was the haruest great, the laborers very few, the scatterers &amp; wasters, almost infinite. This was the state of the Church at the cōming of Christ.</P>
<P>Euen likewise, in these our dayes, Christ our sauiour hath gone abroad in progresse, and done marueilous cures, &amp; shewed strange miracles a∣mōg his people, &amp; hath caused his gospel to ring throughout the world. And as he said then, euē so may it now be said, <HI>Messis multa. <HI>The haruest</HI>
<PB REF="86"/>
is great,</HI> &amp; marueilous forward: yea, euen there where as no worldly hope of haruest could haue beene. Many there are that hunger &amp; thirst after the kingdome of God, which is the knowledge of his Gospel: many that are yet greene &amp; igno∣rant, many that lie by the way side, and yet haue gathered no root, many that as yet are but tares and darnell, I meane blinde and obstinate, but when Gods holy will shalbe, may be turned into good corne, and pertaine to his haruest.</P>
<P>But the laborers are few. I say not, there be but few Cardinals, few bishops, few priests, y<SUP>t</SUP> shold be preachers, few Archdeacons, few Chācelors, few Deanes, few prebendaries, few vicars, few parish Priests, few monkes, few friars: For the number of these is almost infinite. <HI>Gregory Na∣zianzene</HI> in his time, complained at the multi∣tude of Priestes, and saide, they were almost as many as the rest of the people.</P>
<P>And <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperor in his time, was faine to restraine y<SUP>e</SUP> number of thē, &amp; to giue cō∣mandement, that in one cathedral Church there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cōci. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om. 3. cōcil. delect. cardinalium.</NOTE> should neuer be aboue 60. priests, &amp; 100. deacōs. The like order was takē in a general coūcel, for the abating of the multitude of monks, &amp; friars.</P>
<P>And in the booke called <HI>opus tripartitum,</HI> ioy∣ned to y<SUP>e</SUP> councel of <HI>Laterane</HI> these words were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Concil. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om. 2</NOTE> written, <HI>Totus fere mundus obloquitur, &amp; scāda∣lizatur de multitudine religiosorum pauperū, qui introierunt in mundum, qui non iam religiosi, sed
<PB REF="86"/>
trutannij vocantur. <HI>Welneare</HI></HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>whole world crieth against, &amp; is offēded at the great mul∣titude of begging monkes &amp; friars, whiche are entred into the world, &amp; nowe for their behauiour, are called not religious men but varlets.</HI> These be the wordes of the Councel.</P>
<P>The number of these is great: but alas, the number of labourers is very smal. And yet they giue a shewe to the worlde, that they be pastors and feeders of the flocke, that they be the fathers of the people, that they bee the teachers of the multitude, that they be the labourers in the har∣uest, that the whole Catholike Churche stayeth altogether vpon them.</P>
<P>They giue the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> these titles, that hee is the onely key of Christian faith, that he is greater then the Apostles, for that they could erre, and he cannot: they say, he is Christes Uicar, whereas indeede to any mans sight, Christ may be contented to be his Uicar. They say, he is no bare man, but a god, as it is written in the <HI>Decretals</HI> of <HI>Nicholas</HI> Pope, and many other the like, which I leaue.</P>
<P>The Pope calleth the Cardinals. <HI>Cardines mūdi &amp;c. <HI>The very hookes and staies of the world, vpon whom the doore of the church militant must be turned.</HI></HI> Another saith: As a doore turneth vpō the hooke, euen so y<SUP>e</SUP> church of <HI>Rome</HI> is ruled by the Cardinals. Therfore they haue pillars &amp; pollares caried afore thē, in tokē
<PB REF="87"/>
that they be the pillars and staies of the Church: and pollaxes, to beate downe al euil doctrine.</P>
<P>And what shal I speake of bishops? their clo∣uen miter signifieth perfect knowledge of the new testament &amp; the old. Their crosiars staffe, signifieth diligēce in attēding y<SUP>•</SUP> flocke of Christ, Their purple bootes &amp; sandales, signifie y<SUP>•</SUP> they should euer be booted, &amp; ready to go abroad tho∣row thick &amp; thin, to teach the gospel. And there∣to they applied the words of the prophet, <HI>Quam speciosi pedes euangelizantiū pacē, euāgelizantiū bona? <HI>How beautiful are the feet of thē whi∣che bring glad tidings of peace, which bring glad tidings of good things:</HI></HI> but alas in what kind of thing do, they beare thēselues for bishops These misticall titles &amp; shewes are not enough to fetch in the Lords haruest: they are garments more meete for players, then for good laborers. <HI>S. Bernard</HI> writeth thus to <HI>Eugenius</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> who sometime had bin his scholer. <HI>Thou which art the shepheard, iettest vp &amp; down</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De cōsiderat. ad Eug. lib. 4.</NOTE> <HI>shining in gold, &amp; gorgeously attyred: but what get thy sheep? If I durst speake it, these things are not the fodder for Christs sheep, but for diuels.</HI> Whatsoeuer apparel they haue vpon them, vnles they wil fal to woorke, Christ wil not know them for labourers.</P>
<P>How then can the bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> be taken for y<SUP>•</SUP> chiefe pastor of Christ, which these 900. yeeres hath not opened his mouth to feede the flocke:
<PB REF="87"/>
These 900 yeres. I say, since <HI>Gregory</HI> the first of that name, it can hardly be found, that euer a∣ny bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> was seene in a pulpit. One of themselues, <HI>Adrianus</HI> 4. a bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> was wont to say, <HI>Succedimus non Petro in docēdo, sed Romulo in parricidio. <HI>Wee succeede not Peter in teaching, but Romulus in murthering.</HI></HI></P>
<P>And in a canon of the Apostles it is decreed, that the bishop that teacheth not his flock, should be deposed. To which purpose they alleadge <HI>S. August: Episcopatus, nomen est operis, nō honoris:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. deciuit. Dei. lib. 19. cap. 19.</NOTE> <HI>vt intelligat se nō esse Episcopū, qui vult praeesse, non prodesse. <HI>A Bishops office is a name of la∣bor, not a name of honor, that he which co∣ueteth the place of preeminēce, &amp; hath not a desire to do good, may knowe hee is not a bishop.</HI></HI> Thus saith <HI>Origē,</HI> thus saith <HI>Chrisostom,</HI> thus say diuers others of the old fathers, whō it were lōg &amp; needeles to rehearse. <HI>Multi sacerdo∣tes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chri. hom. 43. in opere im∣perfecto in Mat.</NOTE> <HI>pauci sacerdotes,</HI> saith <HI>Chrisost, multi nomine, pauciopere. <HI>There are many priests, and fewe priests: many that beare the name, but fewe that be priests indeede.</HI></HI> Thus the haruest is great &amp; plenteous, but the laborers are but few.</P>
<P>The laborers are but few, but the destroyers &amp; wasters are exceeding many, yea, such as should be the haruest men, most of al destroy the corne.

<P>The time being so short as it is appointed me, wil not suffer me to speake of thē that euen now hinder Gods haruest: &amp; being such men as shold stay the people, as much as they may do by their exāple, disquiet &amp; disturb thē y<SUP>•</SUP> withstand at this time, &amp; resist your graces doings, not in dark or doubtful matters, wherin somthing may be said on both sides, but in such things, as thei thēselus do know were appointed by Christ, published by y<SUP>•</SUP> Apostles, receiued by the old doctors, &amp; vsed, &amp; frequented in y<SUP>•</SUP> primitiue &amp; catholike Church.</P>
<P>Why then wil they not receiue them? Christ himselfe giueth the reason: <HI>Quia dilexerūt ma∣gis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 12.</NOTE> <HI>gloriā hominum, quam gloriam Dei. <HI>Because they loued thē praise of men, more then the praise of God.</HI></HI> They know they should danger their credit, if they should once againe turne,</P>
<P>Why would not the <HI>Pharisies</HI> suffer y<SUP>•</SUP> people to beleeue in Christ: <HI>Cyrillus</HI> maketh answere, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciril. in Ioh. lib. 8. cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Quia quicquid Christo credentium accesserit, sibi detractum putabant.</HI> This was y<SUP>•</SUP> cause saith he,

<P>O lift vp your eyes, &amp; consider how the hearts of your poore brethrē lie waste without instructiō, without knowledge, w<SUP>t</SUP>out the food of life, with∣out the cōfort of Gods word, such a misery as ne∣uer was seen among heathēs. The Turks haue teachers sufficient for their people, the Iewes, albeit they haue no stayed countrey, but liue in banishment, and wander about, yet haue they their Teachers: the Christians which this day liue in <HI>India, Aethiopia, Barbarie, Moorelande,</HI> and other places vnder the persecution of hea∣then princes, yet haue their instructours in true
<PB REF="89"/>
religion. The Christians in old time, when they liued vnder tyrants, and were daily put to most shameful death, &amp; were hated, &amp; despised of al the worlde, yet neuer lacked ministers to instruct them. It is therfore most lamentable, that Chri∣stians liuing vnder a Christian prince, in y<SUP>e</SUP> peace &amp; liberty of the gospel, should lacke learned mi∣nisters to teache them, and instruct them in the worde of God: this is the greatest plague, that God doth send vpon any people.</P>
<P>Contrariwise, the greatest blessing which any people cā receiue at Gods hands, is to haue pro∣phets &amp; preachers, by whō they may be instruc∣ted. When y<SUP>•</SUP> prophet declareth y<SUP>•</SUP> mercy of God towardes Israel, y<SUP>•</SUP> he would put an end to their afflictions, &amp; bring thē home again from <HI>Babylō,</HI> he saith thus, <HI>Behold</HI> (saith the Lord) <HI>I wil send</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 16.</NOTE> <HI>out many fishers, &amp; they shal fish thē.</HI> In the like sort saith <HI>Esai, How beautiful vpō y<SUP>•</SUP> moū∣taines are the feet of him, that declareth, &amp;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 52.</NOTE> <HI>publisheth peace? that declareth good ty∣dings, &amp; publisheth saluatiō, saying vnto Siō, thy god reigneth?

There were the giāts, famous frō the begin∣ning,
<PB REF="89"/>
that were of so great stature, &amp; so ex∣pert in war. Those did not the Lord choose, neither gaue he the way of knowledge vnto thē, but they were destroyed because they had no wisdome, &amp; perished through their own foolishnes. He hath foūd out al the way of knowledge, &amp; hath giuē it vnto Iacob his seruant, &amp; to Israel his beloued.</HI> And againe, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Baruc. 4.</NOTE> <HI>O Israel, we are blessed: for the thinges that are acceptable to god, are declared vnto vs. He hath not dealt so with euery nation, nei∣ther</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 147.</NOTE> <HI>haue they knowledge of his iudgmēts,</HI> saith the Prophet <HI>Dauid.</HI></P>
<P>But when God taketh away his ministers whi∣che should preach peace, &amp; open vnto the people the wil of God, &amp; make known his iudgemēts, it is a token that God is highly displeased with his people. <HI>Where there is no visiō, the peo∣ple</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 29.</NOTE> <HI>decay: they know not what to beleeue.</HI> Of this misery speaketh <HI>Iere.

<PB REF="90"/>
hunger, and taken vp by the wolfe, but none had care to deliuer them.</P>
<P>In such state as the flocke is in, which hath no shepheard: or the shippe which is tossed by the tempestes amiddes the surges and rockes of the Sea, and hath no skilful Pilote to guide it: or the yong sucking childe, that hath no nource to feede it: euen in such stace are your soules, if you haue not the ministery of Gods worde aby∣ding with you. You are children, the Preacher is your nource: you are a shippe in daunger of many wreckes through the boysterous tempests of this worlde, the Preacher is your Pilote to guide you safely towardes the hauen of rest: you are the flocke, the Preacher leadeth you from dangerous places, to feede vpon the whole some pastures of Gods holy worde. Whosoeuer they be which reioyce not in the increase of the Lords haruest, hee forsaketh them, and leaueth them comfortlesse, and giueth them fewe or no labou∣rers.</P>
<P><HI>Wherfore pray the Lorde of the haruest, that he would send forth labourers into his haruest,</HI> It is the Lorde which casteth the firste seede into the earth, whiche doeth moysten the ground, and maketh it fruitful, and giueth forth his sunne, that it may come to ripening. Al the soile, field, corne, and the husbandry therof is the Lordes. Let vs pray to him to send forth labou∣rers to trauaile and take paines.</P>
<P><PB REF="90"/>
Notwithstanding we ought to praye to God, that hee will stirre vp and set foorth men to in∣struct his people: yet that nothing embarreth the authority of princes. For, as God calleth him inwardly in the heart, whom he wil haue to bee a minister of his word: so must he be authorized of his Prince by outward and ciuil calling, as I could shew at large, if time would suffer it.</P>
<P>So <HI>Salomon</HI> the king deposed <HI>Abiathar</HI> the high priest, and set vp <HI>Sadoc.</HI> So <HI>Iustinian</HI> de∣posed two bishops of <HI>Rome, Siluerius,</HI> &amp; <HI>Vigili∣us,</HI> &amp; authorized others. And the same <HI>Iustinian</HI> was wont to say, that he had no lesse regarde to the Church of God, thē he had to his own soule. So <HI>Constantinus, Valentinianus</HI> and <HI>Theodosius</HI> called themselues <HI>Vasallos Christi, The vasals of Christ.</HI> And <HI>Socrates</HI> in his story saith. <HI>Wee</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates li. 5. in prooemio.</NOTE> <HI>haue also herein comprised the Emperours liues, for that sithence the Emperours were first christned, the affaires of</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>church haue depended of them, &amp; the greatest counsels both haue byn, &amp; are kept by their aduise.</HI> It pertaineth therefore also to kings and Prin∣ces to send out labourers into the haruest.</P>
<P>Labourers they must be, and not loyterers. For Christ compareth the teaching of his peo∣ple to thinges that be of greate labour, as to plowing and fallowing of the grounde, to planting of a Uine, to rearing of a House, to threshing of Corne, to feeding of sheepe, to lea∣ding
<PB REF="91"/>
of an Hoste, and keeping of warre: in which thinges is required much diligence and labour.</P>
<P><HI>Cato</HI> in his bookes of husbandry, saith it was an old saw among husbandmen, <HI>Qui terram co∣lit, ne sedeat: est enim aliquid semper quod agat. He that plougheth the ground, must not sit stil: for he hath alwaies somwhat to do.</HI> The worke of the husbandman is neuer ended, hee falloweth, stirreth, soweth, harroweth, weedeth, and tendeth his land.</P>
<P>Therefore, if they he Pastours, let them feede the flocke: if they be Doctours, let them teach the people: if they be watchmen, let them stande vppon their watche: if they bee messen∣gers, let them doe their erraunt. This is the way to buylde vp the Churche of Christ. This commission Christ gaue vnto his Disciples, <HI>Ite in mundum vniuersum, &amp;c. Goe ye into al the world, and preach the Gospel vnto eue∣ry</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. 16.</NOTE> <HI>creature.</HI> Thus by twelue poore Apostles al the world was conquered: Princes and kings, and Emperours were subdued to the faith of Christ. This is the key that openeth the consci∣ence, this is the two edged sword which entreth through, euen to the diuiding asunder of y<SUP>e</SUP> soule and the spirit. Therefore the Apostle saith, <HI>The weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 10.</NOTE> <HI>mighty through God, to cast downe holds,
<PB REF="91"/>
casting down the imaginations &amp; euery hie thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captiuity euerie thought to the obedience of Christ.</HI> This is the only instrumēt, wherwith we may cut down and haue in the haruest of God.</P>
<P>For all mens deuises, Actes, Iawes, or com∣mandements, be the authority thereof neuer so great, yet are not sufficient to content one mans conscience. For the wisedome of man is but fol∣lie before God, &amp; God knoweth the fancies and cogitations of men, that they be but vayne and foolish.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> the great wise Philosopher on a time being sick, when the phisition came to him to minister him a potion, &amp; shewed him not what was in it, began to chafe and take on with him: why, said he, heale not me as thou wouldest heale an oxe or a horse, but shew me what thou giuest me, what are the ingredients, and wherefore thou giuest it me. Euen so must the people bee healed of their errours: they must know what is giuen them, and wherefore.</P>
<P><HI>Fides</HI> (saith <HI>Bernard) suadenda est, non imponē∣da. Faith may not be compulsed by force or rigour, but gently brought in by perswasiō:</HI> For forced faith is no faith. <HI>Saint Paule</HI> saieth, <HI>Faith commeth by hearing, &amp; hearing by</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10.</NOTE> <HI>the word of God.</HI> And therefore it is wel ob∣serued by the wise &amp; politike father <HI>S. Ambrose,
<PB REF="92"/>
that the church of Christ was not gathered by the law, but by faith. Basil</HI> saith, <HI>If you wil haue Gods wisedō take place, al your world¦ly wisedome must be set a parte.</HI> And in like sort <HI>Hillarius, Humanis operib. extructa nō per∣manent: aliter aedificanda Ecclesia, aliter custodi∣enda est &amp;c. Things that be set vp with mans workmanship</HI> (saith <HI>Hillary) will not endure: the church of God must otherwise be buyl∣ded and preserued: for the foundation of it must be layde vppon the Apostles and Pro∣phets. The church being thus built by God, that is to say, by the doctrine of God, shall neuer fall.</HI></P>
<P>I speake not this against all ciuil, and honest lawful policie: for I know it is the gift of God, without the which, nor common state, nor the Church can be mainteined. But this seemeth to haue byn the meaning of these olde Fathers, that in the building of Gods church, y<SUP>e</SUP> preaching of Gods worde must goe before, to quiet mens consciences: and wisedome &amp; pollicie, like hand∣maides must follow after. For this honor &amp; pre∣rogatiue God claimeth onely to himselfe, that his Church must bee built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. Which if it be o∣therwise built, <HI>Nisi dominus aedificauerit domū, in vanum laborauerunt, qui aedificant eam. Vn∣lesse God himselfe build vp the house, they sweat and labour but in vain, that set it vp.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="92"/>
Thus Christ at the beginning gathered his Church, not by lawes of men, but against all law &amp; policy, by the preaching of his word. God might haue instructed <HI>Cornelius</HI> by the Angell that appeared to him, as it appeareth in y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Acts of the Apostles:</HI> but he woulde not so, but sent <HI>Peter</HI> to him, that he might be instructed by the mouth of a Preacher. Hee might haue taught <HI>Paul,</HI> after he had striken him downe from his horse, when he appeared to him, &amp; said, <HI>Ego sum Iesus quē tu persequeris: I am Iesus whō thou persecutest:</HI> But he would not so, but rather left him to be taught by <HI>Ananias.</HI> And as it ap∣peareth in the <HI>Actes of the Apostles,</HI> at the prea∣ching of <HI>Peter</HI> 3000. people were conuerted &amp; wonn in one day, that it might appeare by what tooles, and with what workemen God woulde haue his haruest set forward.</P>
<P>Nowe let vs beholde the present state of our countrey. These wordes of Christ our Sauiour were neuer more true, then we find them now in these our dayes. The haruest is great, &amp; the la∣bourers very fewe: the poore people lyeth forsa∣ken, and left as it were sheepe without a guide: the afflicted in conscience haue no man to quiet them: they growe wilde and sauadge, as it were a people that had no God: they are com∣maunded to change their religion, and forlacke of instruction, they know not whither to turne them: they knowe not, neither what they leaue
<PB REF="93"/>
nor what they should receiue.</P>
<P>Some other defie, and spit at the holy gospel of our Sauiour Christ, and refuse the Couenāt of euerlasting life. Some other for lacke of knowledge, followe after wilfull &amp; blinde mai∣sters, and become Arrians or Pelagians, and thus they blaspheme the sonne of God. Some o∣ther giue themselues ouer to their owne affecti∣ons, and as he saith, reioyce and triumph in their filthinesse, without feare of God, without consci∣ence of sinne, and so treade downe the blood of the testament vnder their feete: and this do they for lacke of teaching, because they haue not lear∣ned men, and preachers to shew them what they should doe.</P>
<P>O, saith our Sauiour Christ the good shep∣heard and Bishop of our soules, my haruest is beaten down and lost, and there is none that wil goe abroade and saue it. My people run head∣long to their own destruction, not of malice but of verye simplicity, onely because they are not taught, because they know not my father nor me. Alas, it is not my fathers will, that anye of them should be lost.</P>
<P>They be our brethren, they be the flocke of God, they be the haruest, they are bought with great price: I beseeche you, euen for that blood that was shed and spent for them and vs al, let vs not despise them.</P>
<P>If the kingdome of God be not worthy to be
<PB REF="93"/>
promoted, yet the kingdome of Satan is wor∣thye to be ouerthrowne. Now is that acceptable and ioyfull time come amongst vs, euen nowe God hath visited his people: now the haruest is greate and plentious. Al the world this day lon∣geth, and groneth after the Gospell. Let vs therefore altogether, directe our prayers to the Lord and master of the haruest.</P>
<P>Wee beseeche thee most mercifull father, for thy sonne Iesus Christes sake, as thou hast plentifully encreased thy haruest, &amp; brought it to a ripenes in these our dayes, so sende out labou∣rers, to get it in, that it be not spilt. Gather in al thy sheepe that lie straying w<SUP>t</SUP>out a heard. Ligh∣ten the heartes of thine aduersaries, that they may know the time of their visitation, and see that blessed hope, whereunto thou haste called them. That all the worlde with one mouth, and one minde, may know and gloryfie thee, the onely true and lyuinge God, and thy sonne Iesus Christ to whom with thee, and the holy Ghost, be al honour and glorye.</P>

Lykewise, after that Christ our Sauiour had ascended into heauen, and the holy Ghoste was powred downe vpon the Apostles, and they be∣gan to speake diuers tongues that they neuer had learned, the enemies disdainefully scorned at the giftes of God, and sayde, <HI>Musto pleni sunt isti, These men be drunken, and full of newe wine.</HI> And therfore they talke they knowe not what.</P>

<P>So wyll I saye, and truely saye, betweene vs and them. They are seene in the tongues, <HI>La∣tine, Greeke,</HI> and <HI>Hebrewe:</HI> so are wee. They haue studied the artes, so haue wee: they haue read the Doctours, the generall Councels, and the scriptures, so haue wee.

<P><HI>S: Paul</HI> was counted and called a rebell, and accused that he was an <HI>Egiptian,</HI> and had gathe∣red <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 24.</NOTE> a number of men of warre to disquiet and trouble the Countrie. <HI>Wee haue founde</HI> (saith <HI>Tertullus) <HI>This man a pestilent fellow, &amp; a mouer of sedition amongest all the Iewes throughout the world.</HI></HI></P>
<P>So saieth <HI>Tertullian,</HI> that in his time the Christians were called <HI>hostes public<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that is, e∣nemies &amp; destroyers of all common states.</P>
<P>And those reportes the enemies not only scat∣tred amonge the common people, but also drop∣ped them into the magistrats &amp; princes eares, that they might haue an il opinion of Christian religion, and suppresse the Ministers and prea∣chers
<PB REF="98"/>
of it: so vnkinde commonly many haue bene towardes the messengers of Gods word.</P>
<P>When Christ hymselfe came downe from Heauen, from the bosome of his father, and be∣gan to vtter &amp; to teache the Gospell of euerla∣sting life, and to confirme the same with manie a straunge myracle: the poore people gaue eare vnto hym, and beleeued his doctrine, and by his wonderous workes knew him to be the sonne of Dauid, the very Messias y<SUP>t</SUP> was promised them.</P>
<P>But the Scribes &amp; Pharises, that bare the name of Doctours, and had bene euermore brought vp in learnynge, &amp; were the instructors of the people, made light of Christes miracles, &amp; said to y<SUP>e</SUP> people, <HI>he casteth out deuils thorow <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the chiefe of the deuils.</HI></P>
<P>The miracle was such, that no reasonable man would haue thought it to be wrought by y<SUP>e</SUP> deuil. The poore man that before had ben deafe, was now able to heare: that before was posses∣sed of the deuill, was now deliuered: that before was sicke, was now restored to his health. The poore people marueiled at the doing, and glo∣rified God. But the Pharisies cryed out against him. <HI>In <HI>Beelzebub principe daemoniorum, eiicit daemonia.</HI> He casteth out deuils through Beel zebub, the chiefe of</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>deuils.</HI> Not because it was true, nor because it was likely to be true, nor because they in their conscience thought it to bee true: but onely to bring Christ in hatred
<PB REF="98"/>
w<SUP>t</SUP> the people, &amp; to deface his doctrin, And ther∣fore they blasphemed that, y<SUP>e</SUP> indeede they coulde not deny: &amp; that they knew to be the workman∣ship of God, they said it proceeded from y<SUP>e</SUP> deuil.</P>
<P>Christe our Sauiour putteth backe these slaunders with diuers reasons, whereof at this time for shortnes sake, I wyll touche but two. The first reason is: Euery kingdome that is di∣uided in it selfe, shal be brought to desolation: if Satan be deuided against him selfe, then must his kingdome needes be dissolued, &amp; that by his owne workyng. But that is not likely. For al y<SUP>e</SUP> Angels of Satan agree and conspire together to y<SUP>e</SUP> vpholding of their kingdome: therfore must you needes confesse that I haue remoued this deuil by some other greater power, &amp; not by the power of <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the chiefest of the deuils.</P>
<P>Here perhaps, some man wil replie that wit∣ches, &amp; coniurers oftentimes chase away one de¦uil by y<SUP>e</SUP> meane of an other. Possible it is so, but that is wroughte, not by power, but by collu∣sion of y<SUP>e</SUP> deuils. For one deuil, y<SUP>e</SUP> better to attain his purpose, will giue place, &amp; make as though he stood in awe of another deuil. And by y<SUP>e</SUP> way, to touch but a worde or two of this matter for y<SUP>t</SUP> the horrible vsing of your poore subiectes infor∣ceth therunto: It may please your grace to vn∣derstād, y<SUP>t</SUP> this kind of people, I meane witches, &amp; sorcerers, w<SUP>t</SUP>in these fewe last yeres, are mar∣ueilously increased w<SUP>t</SUP>in this your graces realm.
<PB REF="99"/>
These eyes haue seene most euident and mani∣fest markes of their wickednesse. Your graces subtectes pine away euen vnto the death, their colour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speach is benummed, their sences are bereft.</P>
<P>Wherefore, your poore subiects most hum∣ble petitiō vnto your highnes, is, that the lawes touching such malefactours, may bee put in due execution. For the schole of them is great, their doinges horible, their malice intollerable, the examples most miserable. And I pray GOD, they neuer practise further, then vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> subiect. But this onely by the way, these be the scholers of <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the chiefe captaine of the deuils.</P>
<P>This first reason that Christ vseth, is taken of common experiēce. For natwithstanding there be nothing so puissant, as y<SUP>e</SUP> force of a kingdom: yet if it be deuided in it self, it wyl perish &amp; come to confusion. For, concord and agreement is the strength and maintenāce of al states. Break the hoopes of a vessel, &amp; al the boordes wil fal asun∣der. The exāples hereof are too rife. The migh∣tiest kingdomes that euer were, by such meanes haue bene conquered, &amp; fallen into the power of their enemies.</P>
<P>Therfore, <HI>Esay</HI> prophecying the destruction of the kingdome of the Jewes, sayeth, firste the people shal fal at dissention within themselues, and then should folow their confusion.</P>
<P>When <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Emperour &amp; his sonne
<PB REF="99"/>
<HI>Titus</HI> came with an armie against <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> the whole natiō of the Jewes was deuided into three factions, eche of them ready to vndo the o∣ther. Then folowed the ouerthrow of that king∣dome. Then was <HI>Hierusalem</HI> rased to y<SUP>e</SUP> groūd: Then were there slayne of the Jewes to the nū∣ber of 1100000. Once agayne I wil say it, be∣cause it is marueilous, and most true, as <HI>Iosephus</HI> (who was thē a capitain there in y<SUP>e</SUP> field) writeth there were then slayne of the Jewes of men, wo∣men and children, no lesse then 1100000.</P>
<P>Of late yeeres, the dissention betweene two brothers, brought all <HI>Graecia</HI> &amp; <HI>Asia,</HI> &amp; al y<SUP>e</SUP> Easte parts of Christendome, into the possession of the <HI>Turke.</HI> But what needeth vs to goe to <HI>Hierusa∣lem</HI> or to <HI>Turkie</HI> for examples:</P>
<P>This kingdome of ours, the mightiest, y<SUP>e</SUP> no∣blest, the richest, y<SUP>e</SUP> blessedest lande that is, or euer was vnder heauen, coulde neuer yet be conque∣red by any enemie, but onely at such time, as the people were at variāce within thēmselues. Thē was <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> with a smal number, then were the English <HI>Saxons,</HI> then were the <HI>Danes,</HI> then was y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke of <HI>Normandie</HI> able to ouerrunne vs, and to possesse our countrie.</P>
<P>Therefore the prince that desireth to be a con∣querour, laboureth not so muche to furnishe his owne men, and to make himselfe strong, as to set discord among his enemies. For that is a ma¦nifest token of their vndoing, &amp; that Gods ven∣geance
<PB REF="100"/>
is at hand. And for that cause, <HI>Herodian</HI> an old writer pronounceth, y<SUP>•</SUP> as much as warre is worse then peace: so much is ciuill sedition worse then warre. And <HI>Titus Liuius</HI> in his sto∣rie saieth, <HI>haec res sola facit, vt magna imperia sint mortalia: <HI>Dissensiō only, saith he, causeth that great Empires can not continue but haue an end.</HI></HI> For, if the one part conquere, and haue the victory, it is euen as if a man with his right hand would maime himselfe, and chop off the left. This example Christ vseth to confound the malice of the Pharisies.</P>
<P>The secōd reason is this: If I cast out deuils by the power of <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> by what power doe your children my disciples, <HI>Iohn, Iames, Peter, Andrew,</HI> &amp; the rest cast them out? They graun∣ted that Christes disciples wrought miracles, onely by the name of God. And yet that they al∣lowed in the scholers, euen of malice &amp; hatred, and contrarie to their conscience, they repoued and blasphemed in y<SUP>e</SUP> master. Hereof Christ con∣cludeth, if I cast out deuils in the power of god, then doubtlesse the kingdome of God is among you: your own childrē shalbe iudges ouer you.</P>
<P>Now to applie these wordes vnto this our present time, wherein vnder a most godly and gracious prince, the trueth of Christes Gospell is freely preached, Gods holy name therfore be praysed for euer.</P>
<P>As <HI>Moses</HI> in his time was counted a sorcer∣rer:
<PB REF="100"/>
as the Jewes were called despisers of al re∣ligion, seditious, and heady agaynst their Prin∣ces: as the Apostles were counted dronken, and full of new wine: as al Christians were called i∣dolaters, worshippers of <HI>Bacchus</HI> &amp; <HI>Ceres,</HI> mur∣therers, incestious, &amp; adulterers: as <HI>S. Paul</HI> for his preaching, was iudged a Rebel: and al Chri∣stians were taken for enemies of all common e∣states: euen so in these latter daies, all these or o∣ther y<SUP>•</SUP> like crimes, haue bene laid to y<SUP>•</SUP> preachers &amp; professors of Christes Gospel: y<SUP>•</SUP> thei haue bene godlesse, seditious, rebelles, despisers of good orders, incestious, adulterers, masters of al sinne and wickednesse.</P>
<P>But this is our comfort, that nothing can be deuised to be spokē against vs, but y<SUP>•</SUP> same afore∣time hath bene deuised &amp; spoken against Christ hymselfe. For he himself was called a Samari∣tan, a cōpanion of publicans &amp; harlotes, a gluc∣ton, a lyar, a blasphemer, a subuerter, of y<SUP>•</SUP> whole nation, a seducer of the people, a rebell against <HI>Caesar,</HI> a sorcerer, a worker by the deuill, and a breaker of the Sabboth day,</P>
<P>We are set vp, saith <HI>Paul,</HI> as a marke for mē to speake against, &amp; whatsoeuer be spoken of vs, be it neuer so vntrue or vnlikely, yet are there some that wyll beleeue it. Yea such thinges as woulde not bee beleeued spoken of a theefe, or a murtherer, wyl soone be beleeued of hym that professeth the name and Gospell of Jesus <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ieremy. 5.</NOTE> Christ. <HI>Woe is mee,</HI> my mother (sayth <HI>Ierimy)
<PB REF="101"/>
that thou hast borne me a contentious mā, &amp; a man that striueth with y<SUP>e</SUP> whole earth: I haue neither lent on vsury, nor men haue lēt vnto me on vsurie: yet euery one doth curse mee.</HI> The vntrue report of these things caused such extremitie as this day you may heare of in other countries, and some times haue seene pre∣sently before your eyes.</P>
<P>Princes, &amp; noble men hated the doctrine of the Gospel, before they knew it. They hated it, and thought ill of it, not of malice, nor against their conscience, nor against y<SUP>e</SUP> testimony of the holye ghost, but only of ignorance, because they lacked instruction, They had a zeale, &amp; a feeling of god, but not according to knowledge. And there∣fore doinge as they did, they thought they dyd God high seruice.</P>
<P>This curtesie had christ our sauieur shewed him when he was in the worlde. The same cur∣tesie must they looke for, that wil become christs disciples. They sayd of Christ, that whatsoeuer he did, he did it in the name of <HI>Beelzebub</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> chief of the deuils. Euen so, whereas it hath pleased almightie God to blesse vs with the true Prea∣chinge, and light of his holy Gospell: yet there are some that condemne it, and call it heresie, &amp; beare the people in hand, that all this doctrine is nothing els but a renuing of old heresies.</P>
<P>It is a greeuous matter for a Christian man, iustly to be accused of heresie. For whosoeuer
<PB REF="101"/>
is an heretique, is an enemie of god, and a wa∣ster and destroyer of all true Religion. And therefore, vnlesse the crime bee marueilous eui∣dent, he doeth great wrong that calleth any man heretique: and though a man be falsely charged, yet may he not dissemble it. <HI>Ruffinus</HI> would say, that mā were not a Christian, whosoeuer would abide to be called an heretique. All other iniu∣ries may be borne withall, but this is suche and so hainous a crime, that vnlesse it be manifestly euident, no man may suffer to be so iudged: and it should not be beleeued, when it is layde to the charge of any Christians.</P>
<P>Wherefore, for as much as the cause is gods, and pertaineth to the conscience of a great ma∣ny, let it be as lawfull for the poore man that is vniustly hurt, to make his salue, as others think it lawfull for them to giue the wound.</P>
<P>Christ our Sauiour, when he was thus char∣ged, made answer, <HI>Si ego in Beelzebub eiicio dae∣monia, filii vestri in quo e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iciunt? If I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whō doe your children cast thē out?</HI> So may we say to such as this daye bee aduersaries to this cause, and speake agaynst vs. If we be heretikes that teach this doctrine, what are the ancient Fathers, the Doctours, and the Apostles that haue taught the same: If they were Catholiques, and haue bene euermore so taken, writinge as they dyd, howe is it that onely wee are not Catholiques,
<PB REF="102"/>
writing &amp; saying as they did? they shal iudge on our side against you. And would God in y<SUP>•</SUP> grea∣test &amp; specialest poynts of our controuersies, all parts would be contented to stand to their iudg∣ment: so should al contention be soone at anend.</P>
<P>For I call Heauen and Earth to witnesse, and speake it before God and his holy Angels, and before the consciences of al them that speak agaynst vs, that touchinge the very substance of religion, wee teache nothinge this day, but that hath bene taught before by Christ him selfe: set abroade by his Apostles: continued in the Pri∣mitiue Church, and maintained by the olde and ancient Doctors.</P>
<P>And in one or two wordes onely to giue a taste of the same, that thereby ye may the better iudge of the rest:</P>
<P>Wee saye, that in the Sacrament after the consecration, remaineth the substance &amp; nature of bread and wine. The same saith. <HI>S. Augustine, S. Chrysostome, Theodoretus, Gelasius,</HI> &amp; others. <HI>Gelasius</HI> wordes are so plaine, as no man can de∣nie them: <HI>Non desinit esse substantia panis &amp; vi∣ni. There leaueth not to be the substance of bread and wine.</HI> Thus wrote they, and were Catholiques.</P>
<P>We say, that Christes last Supper must be vsed as a communion, &amp; frequented with more then one. So Christ ordeined it, so y<SUP>•</SUP> Apostles, the Primitiue Church, and all the olde Doc∣tors
<PB REF="102"/>
practised it, and neuer was there any of them that euer made mētion of a priuate Masse: Thus did they, and yet were they Catholiques.</P>
<P>We say, the holy Communion or sacrament of the breaking &amp; shedding of the body and blood of Christe, ought of necessitie to bee vsed vnder both kindes: Thus did all the Doctors vse it. And <HI>Gelasius</HI> an old father saith, <HI>that otherwise to vse it, is open sacriledge.</HI> And for y<SUP>•</SUP> space of 1000. yeeres after Christ, there can no example be found to the contrary. Thus did they, and yet were Catholiques.</P>
<P>We say, the publique prayers ought to be in the common tongue: that the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> ought not to take vpon him to be the head of the vniuersal Church: that the prince is of right, &amp; by the authority that god hath giuen hym, the hi∣est ruler of his Church and Realme, as well of the ecclesiasticall officers, as of the temporall.</P>
<P>And all these thinges bee aduouched &amp; con∣firmed by y<SUP>e</SUP> examples of the primatiue Church, by the olde general Councels, and by the Doc∣tors. And the contray here of shall neuer be pro∣ued, nor by old father or Doctor, nor by aucient councel, nor by example of y<SUP>•</SUP> primatiue Church, nor by any sufficient authoritie of the Scrip∣tures. I leaue the rest, for it were an infinite la∣bour to say as much as might be saide.</P>
<P>Thus they taught, thus dyd they, &amp; were ca∣tholikes: &amp; alas, are we sayinge the same, onely
<PB REF="103"/>
because we say y<SUP>e</SUP> same, become heretiques: that was once true, is it now become false: that was once Catholique doctrine, is it now at last be∣come heresie: O, mercifull God, was it thy wil, y<SUP>t</SUP> thy trueth should be true but for a season, vntil there should come men to decree the contrary: If we be heretiques that teach the same that the olde Doctours of the Church taught, what then are they, that teach contrary to the Doctours:</P>
<P>Christ our Sauiour to reproue the Pharises, thought it sufficient to say to them, <HI>Hoc Abra∣ham non fecit. This thing Abrahā neuer did.</HI> Therefore are you not the children of Abraham. Euen so may we truely say to such as holde not themselues contented with this doctrine, these things that you do, Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> neuer did. Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> neuer did: none of the ancient fathers euer did: the Apostles in the Catholike primatiue Church neuer did: therefore yee are not the children of <HI>S. Augustine:</HI> ye are not the children of <HI>S. Hierome:</HI> ye are not the children of any of the olde catholique doctors: ye are not the children of Christes primatiue, Catholyke, and vuiuersal Church.</P>
<P>It may not become me to sette order in these thinges: yet if it were lawfull, I woulde wysh that once agayne, as time shoulde serue, there might be had a quiet and a sober disputation: that eche parte might be required to shew their groundes, without selfe wyll, and without af∣fection:
<PB REF="103"/>
not to mayntayne or breede contention, (for I trust it should be the way to take away al contention) but onely that the trueth may bee knowen, many consciences quieted, and the right stone tryed, by comparison of the counter∣faite. For, at the last disputation that should haue bene, you know whiche partie gaue ouer, and would not meddle. Some will saye, the Iud∣ges wyll not be indifferent. And alas, what man that doubteth his owne matter, wyll euer think the Iudges indifferent: Let the whole worlde let our our aduersaries, them selues bee Iudges heerm, (affection put apart) let our aduersaries themselues be Iudges. What can wee offer more? if this bee not sufficient, what can there be sufficient:</P>
<P><HI>Pompeius</HI> a noble Gentleman of <HI>Rome,</HI> at what time he shoulde goe into the fielde against <HI>Caesar,</HI> that then was his enemie, and some of his counsell told him he lacked men, and should neuer be able with so small a number to stande in fielde agaynst <HI>Caesar</HI> beinge well furnished: Tushe, quoth hee, when so euer I shall but beate the ground with my foote, I shall by and by rayse vp a swarme of souldiers. Afterward it befell that <HI>Pompey</HI> was vanquished, and glad to flee. Then <HI>Marcus Cato</HI> an old gentleman, and one of his army sayd to hym, O sir, remem∣ber your promise, you lacke men, now let vs see your swarme of Souldiers.</P>
<P><PB REF="104"/>
It is wel knowne that it hath bene spoken, both in this place, and in other lyke, that al the Doctours, and al the general councels were a∣gainst vs. Nowe the armie is discomstted, nowe they stande in neede of men, nowe let them call for their Doctours and Councels: if they come but with one sufficient Doctour or Councell, they may haue the field.</P>
<P>I speake not this to boast my self of any lear∣ning, but the goodnes of the cause maketh me y<SUP>e</SUP> holder. Neither woulde I haue in this behalfe said so much as I haue, sauing that the matter it selfe, &amp; very necessitie inforced me so to doe. A∣las, it were great pitie that Gods trueth shoulde be defaced w<SUP>t</SUP> priuy whisperings. It were great pitie that whole houses shoulde be ouerthrowen, mēs consciences wounded, the people deceiued, Gods trueth and the loue thereof pulled from your heartes, his woorke blasphemed, as if it came from <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> w<SUP>t</SUP>out any good ground, without any authorytie of the Scripture, with∣out any example of the Primatiue Churche, without Counsell, without any auncient Doc∣tour or father.</P>
<P>But they haue another kinde of learuynge, which because wee haue not, therefore they say we are vnlearned. For if controuersies might haue bene tryed by learnyng, you shoulde neuer haue seene the Masse agayne after it was once downe.</P>
<P><PB REF="104"/>
If there euer come another change, as I pray God wee may neuer see, nor surely euer shall wee, vnlesse our vnkindnesse pull downe Gods plague vppon vs: but, if a change come, suche a one as they looke for, you shall see with what ar∣gument they wyll proue their Masse. We reade that Christ dyd put the Pharises to silence, yet afterwarde when their tyme came, they sayde, <HI>We haue a lawe, and by our law he must die.</HI> But Gods name be praysed, no persecutions, no torments, no fire, no fagot, haue euer weakened the cause of the Gospel. <HI>Tertullian</HI> saith, <HI>Plures</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. in a∣pologet.</NOTE> <HI>effi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imur, quoties metimur: the more we be cut downe, the more we encrease.</HI> These be their arguments, this is their logique: they haue no liking to trie the matter by Scripture, by doc∣tours, by Councel, or by the practise of the most ancient Churches: and, if they make any pre∣tense of likinge such tryall, they doe it for some other hidden purpose, to moue mutinies, and disquiet: that they may woorke their practises, whiles mens heades are occupied and busied with talke of such matters.</P>
<P><HI>Pirrhus</HI> a lustie gentleman, and Kinge of <HI>Epyrus,</HI> when he first tooke Counsell with hys Nobles to wage warre against the Romanes, heard saye hee might soone conquere them, for that they were nothinge else but a sorte of wilde and harbarours people: but afterward, when he

<P>So, what accompt soeuer men make of this doctrine, that god be thanked is taught this day, yet whosoeuer shall come neere &amp; view it well, and try it to the vttermost, and shall finde that al thinges are done seemely and orderly according to the olde doctours, to the Apostles, and to the primatiue Church of Christ, shall fall downe to the grounde, and confesse that the order and ma∣ner therof, or any thing that is taught therein, is not hereticall.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Iohn Baptist</HI> sent his disciples to Christ to knowe whether hee were the true Messias or no, or els, whether they should looke for ano∣ther: Christ made them answer, <HI>Go and shewe Iohn what thinges ye haue hard and seene:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 7.</NOTE> <HI>the blinde receiue sight, &amp; the halte goe, the lepers are clensed, &amp; the deafe heare,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>dead are raised vp, &amp;</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>poore receiue the Gospel.</HI> For these tokens were sufficient to make Iohn vnderstande, that Christ was the true Messias.</P>
<P>Euen so, if a man stande in doubte of this Religion, whether it bee of God or no, let hym but consider, &amp; think with himselfe thus: a great
<PB REF="105"/>
number of errours are now reuealed, supersti∣tion is remoued, idolatrie is taken away, the Sacramentes are rightlye and duly vsed, the dombe speake, the blinde see, the poore afflicted mindes receiue the Gospell, the prayers are in such sort as the people may take profit and com∣fort by them. God giue vs grace to know how great neede we haue to pray, that in all places we may lift vp cleane handes and heartes vnto God, and cal vpon him in spirit and truth.</P>
<P>If this be heresie, then, alas, what is true re∣ligion?

<P>O good brethen, this is the worke of Gods right hande, the kingdome of God doubtlesse is come vppon vs, the prince of errour is put to si∣lence, the readinesse of the people vniuersally &amp; in al places is marueilous, kinges and princes suffer themselues to be led captiues to the obedi∣ence of Christ.

<P>Euen then, I say, euen then, contrarye to all mans reason, God brought all these thinges to passe. Euen then God defeited their policies, not with shielde or Speare, but only with the spirit of his mouthe, that is with preachinge of the

Gospel. There is no counsel agaynst the Lorde, the deuils were cast out by the powre of God.</P>
<P>This is the day which y<SUP>e</SUP> Lord hath wrought: to thee o Lord, y<SUP>e</SUP> prayse hereof is due: thou hast tur∣ned our mourning into ioy: thou hast put to si∣lēce y<SUP>e</SUP> spirit of error: thou hast inflamed y<SUP>t</SUP> hearts of thy people: thou hast brought princes &amp; kings to the obedience of thy sonne Iesus Christ: thou hast opened the eyes of y<SUP>e</SUP> world to espy out, &amp; to cry for y<SUP>e</SUP> cōfort of y<SUP>e</SUP> gospel. Whē al things were in dispaire, yet thou didst reserue vnto thy selfe one litle sparkle, y<SUP>t</SUP> should inkindle agayne light in thy church, y<SUP>t</SUP> shoulde remoue rubbish &amp; fylth out of thy tēple, whose hart should euer be in thy hād, who should do that that good is in thy sight, &amp; should walke in y<SUP>•</SUP> wayes of her father <HI>Dauid.</HI></P>
<P>This is the hand &amp; power of God, this is the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes. God giue vs grace to haue these things euer be∣fore our eyes, that we neuer be vnthankfull.</P>
<P>Now, for al these graces y<SUP>t</SUP> God hath so plenti∣fully powred vpō vs, let vs cōsider what kindnes ought to be rendred on our part. O <HI>Israel,</HI> O my people, saith almighty God, what thing is it y<SUP>t</SUP> I require of thee, but onely that thou loue me, &amp; walk in my wayes: this is our homage, this is our dutie, this shalbe loked for at our hands. <HI>The grace of god,</HI> saith <HI>Paul,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>bringeth saluation vnto al mē, hath appered, &amp; techeth vs</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>we</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 2.</NOTE> <HI>shold liue soberly &amp; righteusly in this presēt

worlde, looking for the blessed hope, &amp; ap∣pearing of the glory of the mighty god, and of our sauiour Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Such, in olde times, was the life of all them that professed the name of Christ. <HI>Tertullian</HI> of his time saith, a Christian man could be known by nothing so wel, as by the changing of his life <HI>Cyprian,</HI> of the Christians in his time, sayth, <HI>Ve∣niunt vt discant, discunt vt viuant. They come,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad Inbai∣anum.</NOTE> <HI>that they may learne, they learne, that they may know how to liue. S. Paul</HI> commendeth the <HI>Philippians, that they shine as lyghtes</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 2.</NOTE> <HI>in the worlde,</HI> that theyr lyfe doth testifie what they be.</P>
<P><HI>Eusebius</HI> saieth, <HI>Valeriani aula, erat referta piis, &amp; Ecclesia Deifacta, They y<SUP>t</SUP> were of the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. hist. Lib. 7. cap. 9.</NOTE> <HI>court of Valerian, were become Christians, and then was the court not lyke a court, but like vnto the Church of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Iustinus</HI> the martir saith, he was first turned to Christ: for the admiration that he had of the innocent and godly life of Christian men.</P>
<P>Such then was the life of them that bare the name of Christ, they came to learne, they lear∣ned to liue. You might haue knowne theyr pro∣fession, by the onely changing of their maners. The court wherin they liued, was so reuerently kept, without notable sinne or wantonnes, as if it has ben the temple of God.</P>
<P>O almighty God, howe fares it nowe with
<PB REF="107"/>
them that woulde be called Christians, and bee reckoned among professors of the Gospel? how many are there that come to learne? how many are there that learne to liue? howe many are there that may be knowne by changing of their maners? Unlesse it be, for that they make a moc∣kerie of Gods holy Gospel, and so become more dissolute, more fleshly, more wanton, then euer they were afore.</P>
<P>What court can we finde, that any part may be lyke the temple of God? Seldome is it, that almightye God may bee hearde to speake hys minde. But when he hath spoken, who is he that thinketh vpon it? who is he that doth not dis∣pise it? who is he that spurneth not at it?</P>
<P>If our life should giue testimonie and report of our religion, sory I am to speake it, but alas, it is to true in too many, it cryeth out, <HI>Non est Deus:</HI> the very course of our life beareth wyt∣nesse against vs, that in our heartes wee thinke there is no God, and that there is no feare of God before our eyes. I amplifie not, nor en∣large the matter: I woulde to God it were no more then I make of it.</P>
<P>Thus we doe withholde the trueth of God in vnrighteousnesse: thus the grace of God is abu∣sed to the contenting of our pleasures: thus wee become the vessels of Gods wrath, and heape vp vengeance vpon our heads. Therefore wil God take away his holy spirit from vs, therefore wyl
<PB REF="108"/>
God giue vs ouer to a reprobate minde, therfore shal y<SUP>e</SUP> end of vs be worse then was y<SUP>e</SUP> beginning.</P>
<P>O good brethren, let vs not abuse the mercy of god, let vs not receiue the grace of god in vaine. Remēber how many eyes are set vpon vs, let vs take occasion away from them y<SUP>t</SUP> seeke occasion to sclander our profession: let not, let not our life cause the gospel of Iesus Christ to be yl spoken of and blasphemed: let vs walke so as becom∣meth them that are called, and in deede are <HI>Filii lucis, The children of light.</HI></P>
<P>The trueth of the gospel of Iesus Christ hath nowe shined ouer the whole worlde: if it be yet hiddē from any, it is hidden frō them that perish: he that perisheth nowe, shall perish in his owne blood. Now, if any beleeue not, he is inexcusa∣ble. The wisdom of god in publishing his word, contrary &amp; against the course of mans policie: y<SUP>e</SUP> continual preaching of it in al places: the ashes of so many learned fath ers &amp; godly men &amp; wo∣men, who haue yeelded their bodies to the cruel torments of tyrants, to bee consumed in the fire for the testimony therof, are yet so fresh in your eies, &amp; spoken of in your hearinge, and witnes∣sed in your hartes and consciences, that you can not denie, but the kingdome of God is come a∣mongst vs.</P>
<P>But if there be any, that is not perswaded in his religion, (for asmuch as it is a matter of lyfe and death, of saluation &amp; damnation) I beseeche
<PB REF="108"/>
you before God, and before his Christ, let vs not be careles, let vs not be negligent. If we mislike it, let vs read the Scriptures, and know where∣fore we mislike it.</P>
<P>Dispise not good brethren, despise not to heare gods worde declared. As you tender your owne soules, be diligent to come to sermons: for that is the ordinary place, where mens hearts be moued, &amp; Gods secrets be reuealed. For be the preacher neuer so weake, yet is the word of God as mightie, &amp; as puisant as euer it was. If thou heare Gods worde spoken by a weake man, an∣ignorant man, a sinner as thou thy selfe art, and yet wilt beleeue it, and heare it with reuerence: it is able to open thine eyes, and to reueale vnto thee the high misteries of thy saluation.</P>
<P>Remember we are the sonnes of the Pro∣phets. The kingdome of God is come amongst vs. Let vs not withstand the Spirit of God: let vs not treade downe the blood of the euerlasting Testament. The hande of god hath wrought this: let vs not arme our selues against GOD, and say, They are wrought in the name of <HI>Beel∣zebub.</HI></P>
<P>It is not our doctrine that we bring you this day, we wrote it not, we founde it not out, wee are not the inuentours of it, wee bringe you no∣thing, but that the olde fathers of the Churche, that the Apostles, that Christ our Sauiour him¦selfe hath brought before vs. O condemne it not,
<PB REF="109" MS="y"/>
before you know it, In the meane while, thinke well of them that labour for you, that do you ser∣uice, that pray for you, that shall giue their lyfe for you.</P>
<P>Let vs lay aside all blinde affection, let vs la∣bour to know the truth, let God, haue the victo∣ry. And then, when we know God, let vs glorifie him as our God, let vs so liue, y<SUP>e</SUP> our words, our deedes, &amp; our whole life may testifie, that y<SUP>e</SUP> king¦dom of god is amōngst vs. Let our light so shine before men, that they may see our good works, &amp; gloryfie our father which is in heauen. So shall God powre downe his blessings vpon vs, so shal god bles whatsoeuer we take in hand, so shal we be blessed in peace, so shal we be blessed in war, so shal god go forth before our armies; so shal we be the children of god, so shall god bee our god, and remayne with vs for euer.</P>
<P>And thou most mercifull father, as thou hast sent vs thy heauenly kingdome, that is, the most comfortable tidyngs of the Gospel of thy sonne Iesus Christ: so wee beseeche thee for thy mercy, blesse that thinge that thou hast begunne, that it may continue among vs, &amp; remaine with vs for euer. Open the heartes of them, that of ig∣norance thinke ill of it, that they may see that blessed hope whereunto thou hast called vs, that al the worlde may know thee, and thy sonne our sauiour Iesus Christ, whome thou hast sent for the redemption of the world.</P>

<P>But before I proceede farther to declare that which is to be spokē at this present, let vs turne our heartes to God, euen the father of lightes, that it may please him to open the eyes of our vnderstanding, and to direct al our doings to his glory. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In worldly businesse, it is reckoned a great poynt of wisedome, to doe thinges in due time, and to choose the fittest season to speake or to holde silence, to buy or to sell, to buylde or to pull downe. <HI>Salomon</HI> therefore sayde, <HI>To all</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 3.</NOTE> <HI>things there is an appoynted time, &amp; a time to euery purpose vnder the heauen.</HI> Who so doeth not weigh the season, and take his conue∣nient time, he is vnwise, and defeiteth himselfe, and bewrayeth his follie. But of all wisedomes this is the greatest, that a man lift vp his eyes to the throne of Gods mercie, and knowe the time of his blessing, and direct his life to the seruice of GOD, as hee warneth: <HI>Make no tarrying to turne vnto the Lorde, and put</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 5.</NOTE>

<P>Who so knoweth not this time, is not wise. Of this blindenesse and heauinesse of the peo∣ple, God complayneth in many places of the Prophetes.

<P>That wee may the better discerne the light, let vs beholde the darkenesse of that time, which was before. The whole worlde was diuided into the people of the Iewes, and the heathens: and besides these, there were no other people. The Heathens were forsaken of God: the Iewes were his chosen people. The Heathens woor∣shipped the workers of their owne handes, and gaue the glory of God vnto creatures, whiche are not God. They went after Idols, euen as they were lead: they had many goddes, accor∣ding to the number of their Cities: they deliue∣red vp their bodies to all manner filthines: God
<PB REF="111"/>
gaue them ouer to followe their lustes. The Fathers amongest them slewe their owne chil∣dren, and offered them vp in Sacrifice to Diuels. So strongly did the Prince of darke∣nesse possesse them, they had not the Arke of the Testimonie, they liued without Pro∣phetes, or couenaunt, or Christe, or God: they liued without hope, or light, or comforte. In such a night, and such a darkenesse lay the Hea∣then.</P>
<P>The Iewes, Gods chosen people, they were also bereft of knowledge: there was no prophet left among them, nor any to teache them the wil of the Lord. The lawe did perish from the priest, and counsel from the auncient: light was tur∣ned into darknesse, and iudgement into worme∣wood: they were bitter and grieuous to the poore: they slew the Prophets which were sent vnto them, they did for sake the fountaine of li∣uing waters, and followed <HI>Baal</HI> and <HI>Astaroth. Like people, like Priestes: frō the sole of the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 1. 6.</NOTE> <HI>foot, vnto</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>head there was nothing whole in them.</HI> Of them God spake by the Prophet, <HI>I</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mala. 1.</NOTE> <HI>haue no pleasure in you, neither wil I accept an offering at your hand.</HI> Of them he sayde, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 1.</NOTE> <HI>When you shal stretch out your hands, I wil hide mine eies from you: and though you make many prayers, I will not heare you,</HI> In such a darkenesse laye the Iewes, in suche a darkenesse laye the Gentiles. All had sinned,
<PB REF="112"/>
they were all corrupt and abhominable in their wayes, they were the Children of wrath, and the vesselles of distruction. So were they wrapt in the cloude of ignoraunce, and couered in the shadowe of death. Suche was the night <HI>Saint Paul</HI> spake of, so vglie, so darke, so voyde of comfort.</P>
<P>But God gaue foorth his light to shyne vppon them, he sent the Patriarches and Pro∣phetes, and holye Fathers, hee sent vnto them <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and Angelles from Heauen, to giue out sparkes of this light. Hee made it appeare by his Prophete <HI>Esaie, Be∣holde,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 7.</NOTE> <HI>the Virgine shall conceyue, and beare a Sonne, and shee shall call his name Emanuell. In him shall all Israel bee saued, hee is the light to lighten the Gentiles, his name shall be called wonderfull, counseller, the mightie God, the euerlasting father, the Prince of peace: in him shal al the endes of the worlde bee blessed.</HI> This light they be∣helde, when it was not cleerely opened vn∣to them, they did see it comming, and re∣ioyced in it, they were vnder a Schoolemai∣ster, and had not the perfect knowledge of this light.</P>
<P>But nowe God hath scattered all these Cloudes, and wee beholde as in a mirrour the glorye of the Lorde with open face. Our elder Fathers in the olde Testament had onely
<PB REF="112"/>
a dimme candle to guide their Feete, we haue the bright Sunne beames: They had onelye the greene blade of the Corne, wee haue the plentifull encrease, euen as in the time of har∣uest: they had the shadowe, we haue the light: they had onely a droppe to refreshe themselues, wee haue the whole streame of Gods mercie powred out vppon vs.</P>
<P>Nowe hath God remembred his holie coue∣naunt, and the othe whiche hee sware to our fa∣ther <HI>Abraham:</HI> nowe the woorde was made fleshe, and dwelt with vs. The day starre is sprong vp in our heartes, the Spirite of God hath filled the whole world: the earth is full of his glorye. The Idols of the Heathen are fal∣len, and are put to silence: their greatest myste∣ries appeare to bee follies, and are laught to scorne, the children make games of them in their streetes. Sathan the Prince of this worlde, which is the accuser of our brethren, is now cast foorth.</P>
<P>Nowe is it knowen, that saluation, and power, and glory belongeth to our God. Hee hath raysed his Christe, and hath established his kingdome, the kings and nations of the worlde shall walke in his light, and his light shall not bee put out, and his kingdome shall haue no ende. Nowe is that newe <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> the glorious Citie of our God reuealed from on high: nowe hath God made the Heauens newe
<PB REF="113"/>
and a newe earth, and hath fixed his Taberna∣cle and dwelling place among men. The ful∣nesse of time is come, the sounde of the Apo∣stles is gone through all the earth: the Sunne of righteousnesse hath appeared: he is the light and comfort of the whole worlde. This is the gracious yeere of mercye, this is the daye whiche the Lorde hath made. Nowe is the mercy of the Lorde shewed more and more towardes vs, and his trueth endureth for e∣uer. When <HI>Balaam</HI> the false Prophete, be∣holde the glorye of this time, hee brake out and sayde, <HI>Who shall liue when GOD doeth</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 24.</NOTE> <HI>this?</HI> Who shall liue, and see, and enioy these thinges?</P>
<P>Awake therefore, or arise from sleepe, the time so requireth: <HI>For nowe is our Saluation neerer then when we beleeued it.</HI> Of those few words, haue growen diuers senses, al good and godly: yet in my iudgement, the simplest and playnest sense is this. When we were hea∣then, and sate in darknesse, we thought we did well, and that wee shoulde be saued in that way, in whiche wee walked: and that there was no hope of saluation, but onelie in that: and wee had a great liking in our doinges. This is the vanitie, and miserie of man: oftetimes where he thinketh himselfe most sure, he is deepely de∣ceyued.</P>
<P>The Turks &amp; the Iewes at this day, &amp; others

the enemies of the crosse of Christ, thinke there is no other true religion but theirs: &amp; in y<SUP>t</SUP> they are woonderfull zealous, and stande in it vnto death: no perswasion nor force can remooue them. When the people of <HI>Ephesus</HI> heard of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 19.</NOTE> preaching of <HI>Paul,</HI> they raysed vproare, and fil∣led the Citie full of tumult: they caught <HI>Gaius</HI> and <HI>Aristarchus</HI> men of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> and <HI>Pauls</HI> companions in his iourney, and woulde haue slayne them: they made an outcrie, saying, <HI>Great is Diana of the Ephesians,</HI> she is a god∣desse, she hath made Heauen and Earth, we haue put our trust in her, we will call vpon her, and she will heare vs. <HI>Christ</HI> she weth his Disci∣ples, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.</NOTE> <HI>The brother shal betray the brother to death &amp; the father the sonne, &amp; the childrē shal rise against their parents, and shall cause them to die, and ye shal be hated of al men for my Name.</HI> For zeale to their GOD, the Priestes of <HI>Baal</HI> cut themselues with kniues <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

Circumcelliones,</HI> which were a sorte of Here∣tikes sprong out of the Donatistes about 420. yeeres after Christ, through zeale murthered one another, they threwe them selues downe from high rockes and destroyed them selues, and thought that, the onely way to please God: so hot and feruent was their deuotion. The
<PB REF="114"/>
children of light haue seldome suffered more, or more willingly, or with more affiance, then the children of darkenesse: so striued they for God, but against God: and abused his name agaynst him selfe, and wittingly and willingly went downe to Hell. They haue great zeale and ear∣nest desire of the glorye of GOD, but not according to knowledge. They contented them selues with that they had receiued of their Fathers, &amp; would seeke no further they thought they did serue GOD, but they blasphemed the Name of the Sonne of GOD. In suche sorte did God suffer them to walke in the blindenesse of their heart. In the latter day many shall say <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7.</NOTE> vnto Christ, <HI>Lorde, Lorde, haue wee not by thy Name prophecied? and by thy Name cast out Diuels? &amp; by thy Name done many greate workes?</HI> Wee haue prayed, and giuen almes for thy sake: was it not done of zeale &amp; deuotion towardes thee? So well shall they be perswaded of their doinges, they shall presse boldely to the throne of Gods Maiesty, and re∣quire their meede.</P>
<P>But Christ shall aunsweare them, <HI>I neuer knewe you:</HI> you serued your fancie, you ser∣ued not mee: your almes, and miracles, and your prayers shall condemne you. Therfore Christe sayde to the Woman of <HI>Samaria, Yee worshippe that which you knowe not.</HI> You <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 4.</NOTE> are ledde with a zeale, and followe your Fa∣thers,

but are deceiued. Euen so, hee prayed his father for them that crucified him, and stood by, and reuiled him, O Father, thou art full of mercie, forgiue them, they are moued of zeale, and thinke they please thee, they knowe not what they doe, they knowe not thee, nor mee thy Sonne whom thou hast sent. <HI>Saint Hie∣rome</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierome con∣tra Luciferia∣nos.</NOTE> saith, <HI>Nomine vnitatis &amp; fidei infidelitas scriptae est. Infidelitie hath bin written vnder the name of faith and vnitie.</HI> For herein they thought them selues good, and holie, and Ca∣tholike, if they departed not from the vnitie of the world. Therfore they followed the generall consent of others, they thought them selues (sai∣eth hee) the true Church, and seemed to follow vnitie, though in deede they fell to infidelitie. <HI>Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne:</HI> whatso∣euer <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14.</NOTE> it be, be it neuer so holy, neuer so glorious, it is sinne, it displeaseth God: the ende thereof is destruction.</P>
<P>Therefore Christ sayeth, <HI>I am the light of the worlde: hee that followeth mee, shall</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 8.</NOTE> <HI>not walke in darkenesse, but shall haue the light of life.</HI> So spake Almightie GOD to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut 5.</NOTE> his people, <HI>Take heede that you doe as the Lorde your GOD hath commaunded you: turne not aside to the right hande, nor to the lefte.</HI> Thou shalt not doe the thing that seemeth right in thine owne eyes: Thou shalte not followe the zeale of thine owne

<P>We were drowned in darkenesse (sayth the Apostle) yet thought we had the light. I my selfe (saith hee) was a blasphemer, and did per∣secute the Church of God: I followed the way of my fathers, I had a great zeale, and thought I did well, but the way wherein I walked, was slippery, the light was darkenesse. I de∣lighted in vanitie, and had pleasure in leasings.

<P>But now is our Saluation come neere vnto vs: our bodies are made the Temples of God, and his spirit dwelleth within vs. We haue the woorde of life put both in our mouth, and in our heart: the kingdome of God is in the middes a∣mongst vs. The Sonne of God calleth vnto vs, <HI>Come vnto me al ye that trauel and be hea∣uily laden, and I wil refresh you.

<P>When <HI>Dauid</HI> heard the voyce of the Lorde, he awaked and rose vp, hee gaue thankes vnto God, and powred out his heart before him, say∣ing, <HI>O Lorde our Lorde, howe wonderfull is thy Name in all the worlde?</HI> And againe, <HI>Prayse the Lorde, O my soule, and all that is within mee, praise his holie Name.</HI> When the Apostles hearde this voyce of the Lorde, they were awaked, they forsooke all they had, they tooke vp their Crosse, and went ouer all the worlde preaching the Gospell of saluati∣on.

When <HI>Paul</HI> heard the voyce of Christ from heauen aboue, he fell flat on the earth, and being astonied, sayde, Lord, what wilt thou that I do? I am thy seruaunt, and the sonne of thy hande∣mayde: make me to doe that thou commandest me to doe.</P>
<P>Then coulde neither life, nor death, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor thinges present, nor thinges to come, nor height, nor depthe, nor any other Creature separate Paule from the loue of God whiche is in Christ Iesus our Lorde: then hee estee∣med not to knowe anye thinge sauing Iesus Christ, and him crucified. He brake his sleepe, rose vp, and went forwarde. In like manner the Prophet <HI>Esay</HI> stirreth vp <HI>Hierusalem, A∣rise, be bright for the light is come, and the glorie of the Lorde is risen vppon thee.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 60.</NOTE> Knowe thy time, and the day of thy visitation, awake thou that sleepest, and stande vp from the dead, for the Sonne of God hath shined ouer thee.</P>
<P>The Apostle therfore saith, <HI>It is nowe time that wee shoulde arise from sleepe.</HI> We are the children of God, we are the children of the trueth, we are the sonnes of the Prophets, we are they whom GOD hath chosen out of the worlde. Whosoeuer putteth his hande to the plough, and looketh backe, is vnmeete for the
<PB REF="116"/>
kingdome of heauen. These thinges are sent for our vnderstanding: GOD hath giuen his worde vnto vs. We haue seene the workes of God, the doumbe to speake, the deafe to heare, the blynde to see, the lame to goe, the dead to rise and come out of their graues: the Sunne to be darkened, the earth to quake, rockes to rent, and the Diuell to confesse the Sonne of God: for he was forced to say, <HI>Thou art Christ the Sonne of God.</HI> Nowe doth the kingdome of heauen suffer violence. The night is passed, the daye is at hande: we haue slumbered enough in ignoraunce, it is nowe time, we knowe the blessinges which GOD hath bestowed vppon vs: it is time wee shoulde be thankefull, and awake out of the sleepe of forgetfulnesse, that wee humble our selues vn∣der the mighty hande of God, and dreame no more of our owne strength: our conscience is charged: we cannot pleade ignoraunce: it is time that we rise: the mercie of God, the aboun∣daunce of his blessing, the feare of his iudge∣ment, the regarde of our saluation so requi∣reth.</P>
<P>Let vs cast away the workes of darkenesse: they bee vnfruitefull, lothesome, and horrible, They darken the hearte, and blinde the consci∣ence: hee that doeth them shall bee cast into vtter darkenesse. Let vs bee afrayde, let
<PB REF="117"/>
vs be ashamed hereof, such things are not fit for the children of light.</P>
<P>Let vs put on the armour of light. God hath chosen vs to bee his Souldiers, and hath called vs foorth into the fielde. Our fight is not against fleshe and blood, but against the Diuell, the Prince of this worlde, and the Fa∣ther of darkenesse: hee rampeth like a Lyon, and lyeth in waite, and seeketh whom hee may deuour. All the vanities of this life, our bodies, our owne heartes conspire against vs: the fight is terrible, the daunger great. Let vs not be vn∣prouided, let vs not stande open to the stroke of the enimie: Let vs take vnto vs the whole ar∣mour of God, let our loyues be girded with be∣ritie, let vs put on the shielde of Faith, the brestplate of righteousnesse, the sworde of the spirit, &amp; the helmet of saluation. These bee the weapons of righteousnesse, these be the armour of light. Let vs not feare to declare the truth, though thereby wee shoulde daunger our life. Let vs bee faithfull vnto the ende, let it ap∣peare that the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God to cast downe holdes, and imaginations, and euery hie thing that is exalted against God: so shal our armour be complete, so shall we shewe glorious in the fielde, and be terrible to the enimie: so shall we stande strong &amp; boldely against sword, and fire, and death: so shall we like faithfull Souldiers

<P><HI>Let vs walke honestly, as in the day, not in gluttony &amp; drunkēnes, neither in Chambe∣ring and wantonnes, nor in strife and enuy∣ing.</HI> He setteth downe three things, as three bot∣ches and carbuncles of the soule: they oppresse the body, defile the minde, and breake the bonde and vnitie of the Church of God.</P>
<P>The first is gluttonie and drunkennes, the roote and mother of al euill: nothinge standeth safe, where wine preuayleth. This was the ini∣quitie of Sadome, abundance, and fulnesse of bread: they abused the gifts of God, to the disho∣nour of god. This was y<SUP>e</SUP> cause of all her filthy∣nes, &amp; her filthines was the cause of her destruc∣tion. Here of God speaketh. <HI>My chosen people,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 32.</NOTE> <HI>My darling is waxed fat: Therefore he for∣sooke god that made him, and regarded not the strong God of his saluation.</HI> And againe, by the Prophet <HI>Esay, The harpe, and viole, timbrell and pipe, are in their feastes, but</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 5.</NOTE> <HI>they regard not the work of the Lorde, ney∣ther consider the worke of his hands.</HI> And in the xxiichap. <HI>Behold ioy and gladnes slaying</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 22.</NOTE> <HI>oxen, and killing sheepe, eating fleshe, and

drinking wine, eating and drinking: for to morowe we shall die.</HI> So through gluttony, and drunkenn es they despised the threatnings of God, and entered not into the way of repen∣tance, but continued in their sinnes, and made scorne of the Prophets of God. <HI>The people of Israel sate them downe to eate and drink &amp;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Erod. 32.</NOTE> <HI>rose vp to play.</HI> They forgat God, and the mer∣cies he had shewed vpon them, and worshipped a golden calfe: So grosse and so deadly are the cloudes of drunkennes. Our Sauiour Christ saith, towardes the latter day the people shall eate and drinke, and be voyd of care, as in the daies of <HI>Noah,</HI> and distruction shall sodainely fall vpon them: therefore Christ sayth, <HI>Woe be to you that are full, for you shall hunger.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Many haue bene slaine in the field, but ma∣nie more haue taken their deadly wounde by surfeting: many haue bene drowned in the sea, but many more haue perished by the strength of wine. It is not set downe, that the rich glutton was an oppressour, an extortioner, an vsurer, or y<SUP>•</SUP> he came vniustly by his goods, but that he abu∣sed the same, y<SUP>t</SUP> be fared deliciously, and became vnthankefull: and therefore was punished in hell fire. Then he which before had aboundance, and did swimine in wine, had not one droppe to quench his thirst. Many make their belly their God. They haue more comfort in the caste of sweete fare, then in the consideratio∣on

of the workes of God. Their table is turned into a snare, their glorie is to their shame. Here will I speake nothing of forcing and quaffinge, God keepe it farre from Christian tables, it is too too wilde &amp; barbarous: the heathens hate it, nature abhorreth it, the horse and mule woulde not vse it. <HI>S. Augustine</HI> saith, <HI>Ebrius non peccatū facit, sed ipse totus est peccatum. <HI>A drunken man doth not commit sinne, but hee is alto∣gether sinne.</HI></HI> And therefore his rewarde is death. <HI>S. Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Drunkardes shall not in∣herite</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 6.</NOTE> <HI>the kingome of God.</HI> They shall drink the cup of y<SUP>•</SUP> wine of the lordes wrath. Therefore Christ sayth, <HI>Take heede to your selues, least</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 21.</NOTE> <HI>at any time your heartes bee opressed with surfeting, and drunkennes, and the cares of this life: &amp; least that day come on you at vn∣wares.</HI> Therefore saith the Apostle, let vs not walke in eating and gluttonie: it will drowne our senses, it will oppresse our nature.</P>
<P>The kingdome of God is neither meat nor drinke: our meat is to do y<SUP>e</SUP> wil of our father. Let vs not abuse the creatures of God: Let vs eate &amp; drinke, that we may liue, only to y<SUP>•</SUP> sustenāce of our bodies: y<SUP>t</SUP> we by the moderate &amp; sober vse of those thinges, may be the better hable to folow &amp; please God in our vocation. The meat for the bellie, &amp; the bellie for the meats: but God shal de∣stroy both it &amp; them. Let vs think of the cuppe which Christ had on y<SUP>•</SUP> crosse: his cup was eisel &amp;
<PB REF="119"/>
tempered with gall: at his hande let vs take the cup of thankes giuing, and call vpon the name of the Lord. Let vs whether we eate, or drinke, remēber who it is that hath bestowed his giftes vpon vs, and whatsoeuer wee doe, let vs doe it to the glory of God.</P>
<P>An other bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch and carbuncle is, chambe∣ring, and wantonnes. Of this also the Apostle warneth vs: for adulterers and fornicators God shall iudge, they shal haue their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimstone, whiche is the second death: the Lorde is the auenger of al such. It is the will of God, that our bodies be kept in holynes, they are the temples of GOD, hee hath called vs to be vessels of honour, that wee shoulde bee holy in body and holy in spirit, that we serue him in holynes and righteousnes, all the dayes of our life.</P>
<P>The last, is strife and enuying. We are one body in Christ Iesus, wee are indued with one spirit, we are mēbers one of another. The Gos∣pel of Christ is the gospell of peace, he hath bro∣ken the stoppe of the partiton wall, hee hath set al thinges at peace. Hee hath taught vs, <HI>learne of me, for I am humble &amp; meeke. Let vs not</HI> (saith <HI>S.

Let not one of you say, I am <HI>Pauls,</HI> and another, I am <HI>Apollos,</HI> the body of Christ is one, it is not deuided. If you bite and deuoure one another,
<PB REF="119"/>
take heede least you consume one another. If there bee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuying, and strife, and dissentions a∣mong you, you are yet carnall, you sauour not of the spirit of God. You are but a litle flocke, the worlde hateth you, ioyne together, loue one another, beare you one anothers burthen, and so fulfill the law of Christ. The fruite of the spirit is loue, ioy, peace, longe sufferinge, gentlenesse, goodnes, faith, meekenes, &amp; temperancie. Loue suffereth long, it is bountiful: loue enuieth not: loue doeth not boast it selfe: it is not puffed vp: it disdaineth not: it seeketh not her owne things: it is not prouoked to anger: it thinketh not euil: it reioyceth not in iniquit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but reioyceth in the trueth: it suffereth all thinges: it beleeueth all thinges, it hopeth all thinges: it endureth al things: loue is the bonde of perfection. The ser∣uant of Christ is not quarrellous: let vs keepe the vnitie of the spirite in the bonde of peace. Let not dissention or malice trouble our hearts, let vs walke after this maner, and so, let vs glo∣rifie God in our mortall bodies. Let vs auoyde these thinges, gluttonie, dronkennes, chambe∣ring &amp; wantonnes, strife and enuying. They be the vnfruitfull workes of darknes: the way of them leadeth vnto damnation.</P>

They eate vp the people as they eate breade.

<P>Wee haue here no continuing Citie, wee are straungers as were al our fathers before vs. If we gather riches to our selues, &amp; be not rich in God, he shall say vnto vs, O foole, this night will they fetch away thy soule from thee: Then whose shall those things be which thou hast pro∣uided: Let him therefore that hath this worldes

goods, be as if hee had them not. They are the giftes of God. The Lorde giueth them and the Lorde taketh them away. Settle not your hearts vpon thē. As they come, so wil they fade away: they bee vncertaine, they will deceiue you. Set your desier vpon heauenly thinges, seeke after the life which is to come in the lande of the liuing. When wee shall see those vn∣speakable ioyes, wee shal perceiue, that all the pleasures of this life, in comparison of them were nothing.</P>
<P>Now, somewhat more specially to applie the woordes of the Apostle to this present time. <HI>It is now time also,</HI> that wee should arise from sleepe. God hath deliuered vs also from the night. We may say, This is the day which the Lorde hath made: Let vs reioyce and be glad in it. Wee may say, he hath shewed his mercies towardes vs, and the truth of the Lorde endu∣reth for euer.</P>
<P>Let vs looke backe to the time late past, and beholde the night of errour, and ignoraunce. What shall I say? Where should I beginne, or howe may I ende? The matter is of great compasse: the time I haue to speake is but shorte: and I haue no delight to speake of dark∣nes. After God had deliuered the people of Is∣rael, and giuen them passage through the red sea, Marie the Prophetesse, sister of <HI>Aaron</HI>
<PB REF="124"/>
looked backe into Egipt. There she remembred <HI>Pharao,</HI> and his crueltie, howe he plagued the children of God: she remembred how by a migh∣tie hande and out stretched arme, hee deliuered them, and wrought his wonders vpon <HI>Pharao,</HI> and all the lande of Egipt. She looked backe vpon the great darknes, and vpon the frogges, and flies, and botches: she behelde the waters turned into blood, the killinge of the first borne of man and beast, the ouerthrowe of <HI>Pharao</HI> and all his Charets in the middes of the sea. And therefore she answered the men, <HI>Singe yee</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15.</NOTE> <HI>vnto the Lorde, for he hath triumphed glo∣riously: The horse and his rider hath he o∣uerthrowen in the sea.</HI></P>
<P>Euen so, let vs cast backe our eies, &amp; make a view of the Church. Loth I am to speake of it: Yet it is nedefull to say somewhat thereof, that we way reioyce in our deliueraunce. All thinges were done in a strang tounge: the priest spake, and the people hearde they knewe not what. No man coulde say Amen to their pray∣ers. The matters were such, that he might be reconed happie which heard them not. They a∣bused the Church of God with vaine fables. If you doubt hereof rede their Legendes and fe∣stiuals. They know this, they acknowlege it. It might well be spoken of them which <HI>Hilla∣rie</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hilar. con. Auxentisi.</NOTE> said, <HI>Sanctiores sunt aures populi quam corda
<PB REF="125"/>
sacerdotum <HI>The eares of the people are more holy, then the hearts of the Priests.</HI></HI></P>
<P>I beseech you, marke the fourme and fashion of their prayes. To the blessed virgin, they sayd, <HI>Aue Maria, salus, et consolatrix viuorum et mortuorum, <HI>Haile Marie, the sauiour &amp; cō∣forter, both of quick &amp; dead.</HI></HI> And agayne, <HI>O gloriosa virgo Maria, libera nos ab omni malo, et a paenis inferni. <HI>O glorious virgin Mary, de∣liuer vs from al euil, &amp; frō the paines of hel.</HI></HI> Agayne, <HI>Monstra te esse matrem, <HI>shewe that thou art a mother.</HI></HI> They cal her, <HI>Regina Coeli, domina mundi, vnica spes miserorum, <HI>Queene of heauen, Lady of</HI></HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>world, the only hope of them that be in miserie.</HI> It were tedious, and vnpleasant to recite the like their blasphemies. Howe did these men accompt of the crosse and passion of Christ? What leaue they to be wrou∣ght by the price of his blood? To speak nothing of the multitude of their intercessours and pa∣trones, of their false miracles, of their deceiue∣able merits and workes of supererogation: how fowle a kinde of Idolatry was it, to worship the image with the selfsame honour, wherwith they worshippe the thing it selfe, that is represented by the Image? As, if the thinge it selfe bee worshipped with godly honour, then must the Image thereof bee worshipped with godlye honour.</P>
<P><PB REF="125"/>
The holy Scriptures, which are the light to direct our wayes, and the power of God to saue our soules, wer hid vnder a bushel. Whosoeuer built him selfe and his faith vpon them, was ad∣iudged an Heretike. Marriage was forbidden, and fornication suffered. They did not onely de∣uoure widowes houses, but drew to them selues the fat of the land, by pretence of their long prai∣ers. I spare your chaste and godly eares: other∣wise, I were able to rehearse many their foule abuses, and workes of darkenesse.</P>
<P>Yet will I shewe you one of their night∣birdes, lately hatched in the nest of all supersti∣tion. It is the <HI>Agnus dei,</HI> heere it is. It was latelie consecrate by the holie Father, and sent from <HI>Rome.</HI> They teache, that by the vertue of their consecration, (or rather coniuration) and blessing, these little thinges haue power to defende the faithfull from lightening and tem∣pest.</P>
<P>O merciful God, what hath the Pope to doe with the lightening: what can a piece of waxe preuaile to the staying of a tempest? The Lorde of heauen and earth, it is hee that sendeth forth lightnings, and raiseth vp tempestes. <HI>Fire and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 148.</NOTE> <HI>haile, snowe and vapours, stormie winde ex∣ecute his woorde.</HI> God will sende foorth his lightening and consume them. <HI>Beholde</HI> (saith <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Ieremie) <HI>the tempest of the Lorde goeth foorth in his wrath, and a violent whirle</HI>
<PB REF="126"/>
winde shal fal downe vpon the head of the wicked.</HI></P>
<P>O, what a shepheard is he, that nowe in this light of the day, thus mocketh and deceiueth the lambes and sheepe of Christ? Is this to woor∣shippe Christ in spirite and trueth? Is this the hope we haue in Christ? Is this the profession of the Gospell? Is this the will of GOD, to commit our liues to so vile a cake? Howbeeit, there is no cause why any man shoulde maruell hereat. For, ignorance which is the mother of errour, by their owne confession, is become the mother of deuotion: and these bee the fruites, and children of blindnesse and ignorance. I will speake nothing of that man from whence this geare commeth. Woulde God hee were the man he woulde seeme to bee. But if the light it selfe be darkenesse, how great then is the dark∣nesse? Yet they say of him, his voyce must be re∣ceiued, as the voyce of <HI>Peter,</HI> and the worde of God him selfe must take authoritie and credite of him. Thus hath hee come betweene, like a Cloude, and eclipsed the sunne of Gods glori∣ous Gospell.</P>
<P>If wee beholde eyther their Schooles, or their Churches, their quier, their pulpit, their prayers, their Sacramentes, their Cleargie, their people, their doctrine, or their life: wee may truely saie as the Prophete saide, <HI>Surely
<PB REF="126"/>
our fathers haue inherited lies, and vanitie,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 16.</NOTE> <HI>wherein was no profite.</HI> We may truely say, the Law hath perished from the Priest, &amp; coun∣sell from the wise, and the worde from the Pro∣phet: the blind did leade the blind, they haue tur∣ned siluer into drosse, and fedde the people with chaffe, in steede of wholesome and good meates. Blessed be the name of God, who hath giuen vs eyes to espie their dealinges, and hath reuea∣led vnto vs his worde, to guide our feete into the way of peace.</P>
<P>I knowe these thinges are defended boldely and obstinately: no maruell. For the Apostle saith, <HI>They haue not all obeied the Gospell.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10.</NOTE> There haue bin, that haue called the light dark∣nesse, and the darknesse light. <HI>If our Gospel be hid</HI> (saith he) <HI>it is hid in them that perish, in</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 4.</NOTE> <HI>whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes.</HI></P>
<P>I will not here make answeare to any par∣ticular, albeit occasion be offered, and happe∣ly it bee looked for. Contention and quarrels haue no ende: All doctrine shall bee brought to tryall, the day of the Lorde shall reueal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> errours, and giue witnesse for the trueth. God will turne all to his glorie. What so euer stirre is raysed vp against the trueth, it is but a smoke, it will soone fade and come to no∣thing.</P>
<P><PB REF="127"/>
There are this day many, to all appearance godly men, of good life, of righteous dealing, of great zeale and conscience: but yet haue not eyes to see these thinges. I protest in their be∣halfe, as did <HI>Paul,</HI> they haue a greate zeale of Gods glorie, woulde God it were according to knowledge. Wee may say with the Prophet, <HI>O Lorde, thy iudgementes are like a great</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 36.</NOTE> <HI>deepe.</HI> Who hath knowen the mynde of the Lorde: or, who is of his counsell: God know∣eth his time. He hath the key of Dauid, hee ope∣neth, and no man shutteth: he is the Father of lightes. Wee are in his hande, both we and al our counsels: God graunt we may put off all fleshly affections, and put on Iesus Christ, and that all the earth may see his glory.</P>
<P>Nowe on the other side, let vs consider howe mercifully God hath dealt with vs. Hee hath restored vnto vs the light of his Gospell, and hath taught vs the secrets of his heauenly will. We heare him talke with vs familiarly in the Scriptures. as a father talketh with his child. Thereby hee kindeleth our faith, and strengthe∣neth our hope: thereby our heartes receiue ioye and comfort. We haue the holy ministration of the Sacraments: we know the couenant of bap∣tisme: wee knowe the couenaunt and mysterie of the Lordes Supper. Wee fall downe toge∣ther, and confesse our life before God: wee pray together, and vnderstande what we pray. This
<PB REF="127"/>
was the order of the Primitiue Churche: this was the order of the Apostles of Christe. If wee compare this with the former, wee shall soone see the difference betweene light and darknesse.</P>
<P>The kingdome of God nowe suffereth vio∣lence. The sounde of the Gospell hath gone o∣uer all the worlde, and the whole worlde is a∣waked therewith, and draweth to it. The sunne is risen, the day is open: God hath made his kingdome woonderfull among vs. It is nowe time, nowe is it time that wee shoulde arise from sleepe: for nowe is our saluation neere. Nowe it is in our mouth, wee can speake of it: GOD graunt it may bee neerer vs, euen in our heartes. The night is past, GOD graunt it be past for euer: that we be neuer againe throw∣en into the darkenesse of death: that the worde of life, the trueth of Christ, be neuer againe ta∣ken from vs. And it shall neuer be taken away, if wee bee thankefull. Unkindenesse can neuer scape vnplagued. Let vs wake, let vs wake, our sleepe is deadly. Let vs pray to GOD to awake vs: hee is able to rayse the dead. Our Sauiour saith, <HI>The houre shall come, when</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 5.</NOTE> <HI>the dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it, shall liue. Lazarus</HI> was dead, yet hee hearde the voyce of Christe, and rose vp agayne, and came a∣broade.</P>
<P><PB REF="128"/>
Let vs put on Iesus Christ, let it appeare vpon vs that we weare him, let vs not be asha∣med of his Gospell, it is the power of God to saluation. If we be ashamed of him and of his wordes, hee will be also ashamed of vs, when he commeth in the glorie of his father, with the ho∣ly Angels.</P>
<P>Let vs cast away the workes of darkenesse, and all doctrines of superstition and ignorance. Let vs beholde the troubles and miseries of other countries. Heauen and earth, our bre∣thren, the care of our saluation, the Sonne of God himselfe put vs in minde, that it is nowe time.</P>
<P>Whiles we haue time, let vs doe good: let vs seeke God whiles hee may bee founde. The Lorde wayteth when hee may shewe his mer∣cies: Let vs turne vnto him with an vpright heart. So shall he turne to vs: so shal we walke as the children of light, so shall wee shine as the sunne in the kingdome of our Father, so shall God bee our God, and will abide with vs for e∣uer.</P>
<P>And thou, O most mercifull Father, wee beseeche thee for thy mercie sake, continue thy grace and fauour towardes vs: let the sunne of thy Gospell neuer goe downe out of our heartes, let thy trueth abide, and be sta∣blished among vs for euer. Helpe our vnbe∣liefe,

encreace our faith, giue vs heartes to con∣sider the time of our visitation: Apparrell vs throughly with Christ, that hee may liue in vs, and so thy Name may bee glorified in vs in the sight of al the world.</P>

<HEAD>❧ A treatise of the Sacra∣ments gathered out of certaine Ser∣mons, which the Reuerend <HI>Fa∣ther in God, Bishop Iewel, prea∣ched at Salisburie.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Haue opened vnto you y<SUP>•</SUP> con∣tents of the Lordes prayer, &amp; shewed you vpon whom wee ought to call, &amp; what to aske: and y<SUP>•</SUP> articles of our Christiā faith, in God y<SUP>e</SUP> father, y<SUP>•</SUP> sonn, &amp; the holy Ghost, of y<SUP>e</SUP> church, of remission of sins, of the resurrection, &amp; of life euerlasting, &amp;c. And I haue opened vnto you the ten commandements, &amp; in them what our duetie is towards God, towards our Prince and magi∣strates, towards our parēts, towards our neigh∣bour, &amp; towards our selues. Al this haue I done simply, &amp; plainly, without al shewe of learning, that it might the better sinke into our heartes.</P>
<P>Nowe I thinke good to speake of the Sa∣craments of the Church, that al you may know what they are, because you are all partakers of the holy sacraments. Christ hath ordeined them, that by them hee might set before our eyes the
<PB REF="131"/>
mysteries of our saluation, and might more strongly confirme the faith, which wee haue in his blood, &amp; might seale his grace in our hearts. As Princes seales confirme and warrant their deedes and char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers: so doe the Sacramentes witnesse vnto our conscience, that Gods promi∣ses are true, and shall continue for euer. Thus doeth God make knowen his secret purpose to his Church: first, he declareth his mercie by his worde: then he sealeth it, and assureth it by his sacraments. In the word we haue his promises: in the sacraments we see them.</P>
<P>It woulde require a long time, if I should vtter that might be saide in this matter: especi∣ally in laying open such errours and abuses, as haue crept into the Church. But I wil haue re∣gard to this place, and so frame my speech, that the meanest &amp; simplest may reape profite there∣by. That you may the better remember it, I wil keepe this order. I wil shewe you, what a Sa∣crament is: Secondly, who hath ordained them: thirdly, wherfore they were ordained, and, what they worke in vs: fourthly, how many there are: and then I will briefly speake of euery of them.</P>
<P>A Sacrament is an outwarde and visible signe, whereby GOD sealeth vp his grace in our heartes, to the confirmation of our Faith. <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> saith, <HI>Sacramentum est inuisi∣bilis gratiae visibile signum. A Sacramēt is a vi∣sible signe of grace inuisible.</HI> And y<SUP>t</SUP> wee may
<PB REF="131"/>
the better vnderstand him, hee telleth vs what thing we should call a signe. <HI>A signe, is a thing</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de doct. Chri. li. 2. ca. 1</NOTE> <HI>that besides the sight itself, which it offreth to the sēses, causeth of itself some other cer∣taine thing to come to knowledge.</HI> In Bap∣tisme, the water is the signe: and the thing sig∣nified, is the grace of God. Wee see the water, but the grace of God is inuisible: we cannot see it. Moreouer he saith, <HI>Signa, cum ad res diuinas</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad Marcelli∣num epist. 5.</NOTE> <HI>adhibentur, Sacramenta vocantur. Signes, whē thei be applied to godly things, be called sa∣cramentes.</HI> The signification and substance of the sacrament, is to shew vs, how we are washed with the passion of Christ, and how we are fedde with the body of Christ. And againe, <HI>If Sacra∣ments</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. epist, 23. ad Bonifaciū.</NOTE> <HI>had not a certain likenes, and repre∣sentatiō of the things wherof they be sacra∣ments, then indeed they were no sacramēts.</HI> And because of this likenesse whiche they haue with the things they represent, they be ofttimes termed by the names of the things themselues. Therefore after a certaine maner of speech (and not otherwise) the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ, is the body of Christ, &amp; the Sacrament of the blood of Christ, is the blood of Christ: so the sacrament of faith, is faith.</P>
<P>Who hath ordeined the Sacramentes? Not any Prelate, not any Prince, not any Angel, or Archangel, but onely God himselfe. For, he on∣ly hath authoritie to seale the charter, in whose
<PB REF="132"/>
authoritie onely it is to graunt it. And onely he giueth the pledge, and confirmeth his grace to vs, whiche giueth his grace into our heartes. <HI>Chrisost.</HI> sayth, <HI>Diuinū &amp; integrum non esset my∣sterium, si quicquam ex te adderes.</HI> The mystery <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 7. in 1. Corin.</NOTE> <HI>were not of God nor perfect, if thou shoul∣dest put any thing to it.</HI> In the daies of <HI>Noah,</HI> when God determined to be mercifull vnto his people, and neuer to drowne the whole worlde with water, he said, <HI>I haue set my bowe in the cloude, and it shalbe for a signe of the coue∣nant</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9.</NOTE> <HI>betweene me and the earth and when I shal couer the earth with a cloude, and the bow shalbe seen in the cloude, then wil I re∣member my couenaunt whiche is betweene me &amp; you, and betweene euery liuing thing in flesh, and there shalbe no more waters of a flood to destroy al flesh.</HI></P>
<P>In like maner, when God would witnes &amp; sta∣blish to <HI>Abraham</HI> &amp; his seede after him, the pro∣mise of his mercie: he himselfe ordained a sacra∣ment to confirm the same: <HI>This is my couenāt which ye shal keep between me &amp; you, &amp; thy</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.</NOTE> <HI>seed after thee. Let euery manchild among you be circūcised.</HI> Thus God ordeined y<SUP>t</SUP> sacra¦ment of circūcision. This sacramēt was a seale of Gods promise to <HI>Abrahā,</HI> &amp; a seale of <HI>Abra∣hams</HI> faith, &amp; obedience towardes God. By this sacrament mā was bound to y<SUP>t</SUP> Lord: &amp; by y<SUP>t</SUP> same sacrament God vouchsafed to binde himselfe to
<PB REF="132"/>
man. But how is the sacrament formed? of what parts is it made? <HI>August.</HI> saith, <HI>Accedat verbū</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tract. 80. in 13. Ioh.</NOTE> <HI>ad elementū, &amp; fit sacramentū. Ioine</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>word of Christs institutiō with the sensible creature, &amp; therof is made a sacramēt.</HI> Ioyue the word to the creature of water, and thereof is made the sacrament of Baptisme: take away the worde, then what is the water other then water? The worde of God &amp; the creature make a sacrament.</P>
<P>But why were sacraments ordeined? he telleth you: <HI>In nullū noncē religionis, ceu verū &amp;c. Men</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 19. cōtra Faust. cap. 11.</NOTE> <HI>cānot be gathered together to the professi∣on of any religiō, whether it be true or false: vnlesse they be bound inthe felowship of vi∣sible signes or sacramēts.</HI> The first cause why they were ordeined, is, that thereby one shoulde acknowledge another, as felowes of one house∣hold, &amp; members of one body. So was al Israel reckoned the children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> because of their circumcision, &amp; al such as were vncircum∣cised, were cut off from the people, &amp; had no part in the common wealth of Israel, because they were vncircumcised: Euen as wee take them that are not baptised, to be none of our brethren, to be no children of God, nor members of his Church, because they will not take the Sacra∣ment of Babtisme.</P>
<P>An other cause, is, to moue, instruct, and teach our dul and heauy hearts, by sensible cre∣atures, that so our negligence in not heeding or
<PB REF="133"/>
marking the woorde of God spoken vnto vs, might be amended. For if any man haue the out∣ward seale, and haue not the faith thereof sealed within his heart, it auayleth him not: hee is but an hypocrite and dissembler. So the circumci∣sion of the foreskinne of the fleshe, taught them to mortifie their fleshly affections, and to cut off the thoughts and deuises of their wicked hearts. Therefore said <HI>Stephen</HI> to the Iewes, <HI>Ye stiffe∣necked, &amp; of vncircumcised hearts &amp; eares,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 7.</NOTE> <HI>you haue alwaies resisted the holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>So, when in Baptisme our bodies are wa∣shed with water, wee are taught that our soules are washed in the blood of Christ. The outward washing or spriukling, doth represent the spriu∣keling and washing which is wrought within vs: the water doeth signifie the blood of Christ. If we were nothing else but soule, hee would giue vs his grace barely and alone, without ioy∣ning it to any creature, as hee doeth to his An∣gels: but seeing our spirite is drowned in our bodie, and our fleshe doeth make our vnderstan∣ding dul: therefore we receiue his grace by sen∣sible thinges.</P>
<P><HI>Chrysost.</HI> saith, <HI>Aliter ego, &amp; aliter incredulus disponitur. Ille cū &amp;c. I am otherwise affected,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 7. in 1. Cor.</NOTE> <HI>thē is he which beleeueth not. Whē he hea∣reth of the water of Baptisme, hee thinketh it is nothing els but water: But, I see (not the creature onelie, which mine eyes do see, but
<PB REF="133"/>
also) the cleansing of my soule by the holie Ghost. He thinketh y<SUP>t</SUP> my body oneli is wa∣shed: I beleue, that my soule is therby made pure &amp; holy: and withal I consider Christes burial, his resurrectiō, our sanctificatiō, righ¦teousnes, redemption, adoption, our inheri∣tance, the kingdom of heauen, &amp; the fulnes of the spirit.</HI> For I iudge not of y<SUP>e</SUP> things I see by my bodily eyes, but by the eyes of my minde.</P>
<P>When one that is vnlearned, and can not reade, looketh vpō a booke, be the booke neuer so true, neuer so wel written, yet because be know∣eth not the letters, and cannot reade, hee looketh vpon it in vayne. Hee may turne ouer all the leaues, and looke vppon all, and see nothing: but another that can reade, &amp; hath iudgement to vnderstād, cōsidereth the whole story, the dough∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e deedes, graue counsels, discrete answeres, ex∣amples, promises, threatnings, the very drifte, &amp; meaning of him that wrote it. So do the faithful receiue the fruite &amp; comfort by the Sacraments, which the wicked &amp; vngodlie neither consider, nor receiue. Thus do the sacraments leade vs, &amp; instruct vs to behold the secrete and vnknowen mercies of God, and to carry our selues to the o∣bedience of his will. And this is the other cause, why sacraments were ordained.</P>

<HI>the righteousnes of the faith, which he had when he was vncircūcised.</HI> By these, we stoy y<SUP>•</SUP> mouth of heretikes. For, if they denie that our Lorde Iesus Christ was deliuered to death for our sinnes, &amp; is risen again for our iustification: we shew them our sacramēts, that they were or∣deined, to put vs in remembrance of Christ, and that by the vse of them, we shew the Lords death til he come. We tell them, these are proofes, and signes, that Christ suffered death for vs on the crosse. As <HI>Chrisostome</HI> saith, <HI>Laying out these</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrisost. in Mat. hom. 83.</NOTE> <HI>mysteries, we stoppe their mouthes.</HI></P>
<P>What? Are they nothing els but bare and na∣ked signes? God forbid. They are the seales of God, heauenly tokens and signes of the grace, and righteousnes, and mercie giuen and impu∣ted to vs. Circumcision was not a bare signe. <HI>That is not circūcision, which is outward in the fleshe,</HI> saith <HI>Paul, <HI>but the circumcision of</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the heart.</HI> And againe, <HI>In Christ ye are circū∣cised with circūcision made without hands,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Coloss. 2.</NOTE> <HI>by putting off the sinfull body of the fleshe, through the circumcision of Christ.</HI> Euen so is not Baptisme ante bare signe. <HI>Baptisma e∣ius,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad Hebr. hom. 16.</NOTE> saith <HI>Chrisostome, etiam passio eius est. <HI>Christes baptisme, is Christes passion.</HI></HI> They are not bare signes: it were blasphemie so to say. The grace of God doeth alwayes woorke with his Sacramentes: but wee are taught not to seeke that grace in the signe, but to assure our
<PB REF="135"/>
selues by receiuing the signe, that it is giuen vs by the thing signified. We are not washed from our sinnes by the water, we are not fed to eter∣nall life by the bread and wine, but by the preci∣ous blood of our sauiour Christ, that lieth hid in these Sacraments.</P>
<P><HI>Bernard</HI> saith, <HI>Datur annulus ad inuestiendū, &amp;c. <HI>The fashiō is to deliuer a ring, when sei∣sin</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Serm. de coe∣na Do.</NOTE> <HI>and possession of inheritance is giuē: the ring is a signe of the possession. So that hee which hath taken it, may say, the ring is no∣thing, I care not for it: it is the inheritance, which I sought for.

<P><HI>Chrisost.</HI> saith, <HI>In nobis non simplex aqua opera∣tur</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 35. in Iohan.</NOTE> <HI>sed cū accepit gratiam spiritus, abluit omnia peccata. <HI>Plaine or bare water worketh not in vs, but when it hath receiued the grace of the holy Ghost, it washeth away all our sins.</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amb. de Sac. lib. 1. cap. 5.</NOTE> So saith <HI>Ambrose</HI> also, <HI>Spiritus sanctus descen∣dit, &amp; consecrat aquā. <HI>The holy Ghost cōmeth down, &amp; halloweth the water.</HI></HI> And, <HI>Praesentia Trinitatis adest. <HI>There is the presence of the</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciril. in Ioh. lib. 2. cap. 42.</NOTE> <HI>Trinitie.</HI> So saith <HI>Ciril, Quemadmodū viribus ignis aqua &amp;c. <HI>As water throughly heat with fire, burneth as well as the fire: so the wa∣ters whiche washe the bodie of him that</HI>
<PB REF="136"/>
is baptized, are changed into diuine power, by the working of</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>holy ghost.</HI> So said <HI>Leo,</HI> sometimes a bishop of <HI>Rome: Dedit aquae, quod</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leo. Ser. 5. de nat. Dom.</NOTE> <HI>dedit matri. Virtus enim altissimi, &amp; obūbratio Spiritus sancti, quae fecit vt Maria pareret sal∣uatorem, eadē fecit, vt regeneret vnda credentē. <HI>Christ hath giuen like preeminence to the water of Baptism, as he gaue to his mother. For, that power of the highest, and that o∣uershadowing of the holye Ghoste whiche brought to passe,</HI></HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Mary <HI>should bring forth the sauiour of the world, hath also brought to passe, that the water should beare a new, or regenerate him that beleeueth.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Suche opinion had the auncient learned fa∣thers, and such reuerent wordes they vsed, when they entreated of the Sacraments, For, it is not man, but God which worketh by them: yet is it not the creature of bread or water, but the soule of man, that receiueth the grace of God. These corruptible creatures neede it not: we haue need of Gods grace. But this is a phrase of speaking. For the power of God, the grace of GOD, the presence of the Trinitie, the holy Ghost, the gift of God, are not in the water, but in vs. And wee were not made, because of the sacramentes: but the sacraments were ordeined for our sake.</P>
<P>Now, for the number of Sacraments, howe many there be: it may seeme somewhat hard to say, &amp; that it cannot be spoken without offence.
<PB REF="136"/>
For mens iudgments herein haue swarued ve∣ry much: some haue said, there are two: others three: others foure: and others, that there are se∣uen Sacramentes. This difference of opinions standeth rather in tearmes, then in the matter. For a Sacramēt in y<SUP>e</SUP> maner of speaking which the Church vseth, &amp; in the writings of the holy scripture, &amp; of auncient fathers sometimes sig∣nifieth properly euery such Sacrament which Christ hath ordayned in the newe Testament, for which he hath chosen some certain element, and spoken speciall wordes to make it a Sacra∣ment, and hath annexed thereto the promise of grace: sometimes it is vsed in a generall kinde of taking, and so euery mysterie set downe to teach the people, and many thinges that indeed and by speciall propertie be no sacraments, may neuerthelesse passe vnder the generall name of a Sacrament.</P>
<P>The sacraments instituted by Christ, are only two: the sacrament of Baptisme, &amp; of our Lords Supper, as the auncient learned fathers haue made acompt of them. <HI>S. Ambrose</HI> haueing oc∣casion of purpose to entreate of y<SUP>e</SUP> Sacraments, speaketh but of two. <HI>De Sacramentis,</HI> saith he, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. de Sac. cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>quae accepistis, sermonē adorior. <HI>I begin to speak of the Sacramēts which you haue receiued.</HI></HI> And yet in his whole treatise deuided into sixe bookes, he writeth but of two: his booke is extāt if any man doubt this, he may see it.</P>
<P><PB REF="137"/>
<HI>S. Augustine</HI> reckoneth them to be but two: <HI>Haec sunt ecclesiae gemina Sacramenta. <HI>These be</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De Symb. ad catachumen. Lib. 3. ca. 9. de doct. Christ.</NOTE> <HI>the two Sacraments of the church.</HI> Again he saith, <HI>Quaedam pauca pro multis, eadem{que} factu facilima, &amp;c. <HI>Our Lord &amp; his Apostles haue deliuered vnto vs, a few sacraments in steede of many: &amp; the same in doing most easie, in signification most excellent, in obseruation most reuerend, as is the Sacrament of Bap∣tisme, and the celebration of the bodie and blood of our Lord.</HI></HI> Thus <HI>Augustine</HI> and <HI>Am∣brose,</HI> vnto whom I might also ioyne other auncient fathers, recken but two Sacramentes. Let no man then be offended with vs for so do∣ing: wee doe no newe thing, but restore the ordi∣nance of Christ, and keepe the example of the holy fathers.</P>
<P>What then: Doe we refuse confirmation, pe∣nance, orders, and matrimonie: Is there no vse of these among vs? doe we not allow them: yes. For we doe confirme and teache repentance, &amp; minister holy orders, and account matrimonie, &amp; so vse it, as an honorable state of life. We visit y<SUP>e</SUP> sicke among vs, and anoynt them with the pre∣cious oyle of the mercy of God. But we cal not these sacraments, because they haue not the like institution. Confirmation was not ordeyned by Christ: penance hath not any outward element ioyned to the worde: the same may be sayd of or∣ders. And matrimony was not first instituted by
<PB REF="137"/>
Christ: for God ordeined it in paradise long be∣fore. But in these two, we haue both the element and the institution. In Baptisme, the element is water, in the Lords Supper, bread and wine. Baptisme hath the word of institution. <HI>Teache al nations, baptizing them in the name of</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghost.</HI> The Lords supper in like maner hath the worde of institution, <HI>Doe this in remēbrance of me.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 22.</NOTE> Therfore these two are properly and truly cal∣led the Sacraments of the Churche, because in them the element is ioyned to the word, and they take their ordinance of Christe, and be visible signes of inuisible grace.</P>
<P>Nowe, whatsoeuer lacketh eyther of these, it is no Sacrament. Therefore are not the other fiue, which are so reckoned, and make vp the number of seuen, in due signification and right meaning, taken for sacraments. For, in such sort as these are called sacramentes, that is, because they signifie some holy thing, wee shall finde a great number of thinges, which the godly lear∣ned Fathers haue called Sacramentes, and yet I trow, we must not holde them as sacraments ordeined to be kept and continued in the church: for then shoulde there bee not seuen, but seuen∣teene sacramentes.</P>
<P><HI>S. Bernard</HI> calleth the washing of the Apostles feete a sacrament, <HI>Ablutio pedum sacramen∣tū</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Serm. de coe∣na Dom.</NOTE> <HI>est quotidianorum peccatorum. <HI>The washing</HI>
<PB REF="138"/>
of feet, is the Sacrament of daily sinnes.</HI> So <HI>Leo</HI> calleth the crosse of Christ a sacramēt. <HI>Crux Christi quae saluandis est impensa fidelibus, &amp; sa∣cramentū</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Serm. 2. de re∣sur. D.</NOTE> <HI>est, &amp; exemplū <HI>The crosse of Christ, which was giuē to saue the faithfull, is both a Sacrament, &amp; also an example.</HI> Tertullian</HI> calleth the whole state of Christian faith, <HI>Religi∣onis Christianae Sacramentum. <HI>The sacrament</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. contra Marcion.</NOTE> <HI>of Christian religion. <HI>S. Hillary</HI></HI> in diuers pla∣ces saith, <HI>Sacramentum orationis, sacramentum esuritionis, sacramentum sitis, sacramentū fletus, sacramentū scripturarū. <HI>The sacramēt of prai∣er, the sacrament of fasting, the sacramēt of thirst, the sacrament of weeping, the Sacra∣mēt of the scriptures.</HI></HI> Thus much for the nū∣ber, that by the institutiō of Christ, there are but two sacramēts, as <HI>Cardinal Bessarion</HI> confesseth, <HI>Haec duo sola Sacramenta in Euangelijs manife∣sté</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bessar. de Sa∣cram. Euchar.</NOTE> <HI>tradita legimus. <HI>We reade, that these two onely Sacraments were deliuered vs plain∣ly in the Gospel.</HI></HI></P>
<P>I wil now speake briefly of the sacramentes in seueral, &amp; leaue all idle &amp; vaine questions, and onely lay open so much as is needful, &amp; profita∣ble for you to know. Baptisme therefore is our regeneration or newe birth, whereby wee are borne a new in Christ, &amp; are made the sonnes of God, &amp; heires of the kingdome of heauen, it is a sacrament of the remission of sinnes, and of that washing which we haue in the blood of Christ.
<PB REF="138"/>
We are al borne the children of wrath, and haue our part in the offence of Adam. <HI>S. Paul</HI> saith. <HI>By one man sinne entred into the world. <HI>Au∣gust.</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5. De verbis A∣postol. Ser. 14.</NOTE> saith, <HI>Non dixit, veniet super eum, sed manet super eum. Respexit originem &amp;c. <HI>Christ saide not, it shal come vpon him, but it abideth on him: He had regard to our ofspring, whē he saith, the wrath of God abideth on him. Vp∣on which when the Apostle also looked, hee said, and we our selues also were sometimes the children of wrath. That which in Adam was imputed to his offence, &amp; not to bee of nature, is now in vs, which are come of Adā, become natural.</HI></HI> Therefore saith the Prophet, <HI>Behold, I was borne in iniquity, and in sinn</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 51.</NOTE> <HI>hath my mother conceiued me.</HI> So y<SUP>t</SUP> we all haue cause to crie out &amp; mone with <HI>Saint Paule, <HI>I see another law in my members rebelling</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7.</NOTE> <HI>against the law of my minde, &amp; leading me captiue vnto the lawe of sinne whiche is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the bodye of this death?</HI> Here of speaketh our sauiour, <HI>That whi∣che</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 3.</NOTE> <HI>is born of the flesh is flesh: &amp; that which is borne of the spirite, is spirite.</HI> And for this cause, saith he, <HI>except a man bee borne of the water and the spirite, hee cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</HI></P>
<P>For this cause are infants baptized, because they are borne in sinne, and cannot become spi∣rituall,
<PB REF="139"/>
but by this newe birth of the water and the spirite. They are the heires of the promise: the couenaunt of Gods fauour is made vnto them. God saide to <HI>Abraham, I will establish my couenant betweene me and thee, and thy seede after thee in their generations, for</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 17.</NOTE> <HI>an euerlasting couenaunt, to be God vnto thee, and to thy seede after thee.</HI> Therefore saith the Apostle, <HI>If the roote be holy, so are</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. 1. Cor. 7.</NOTE> <HI>the branches.</HI> And againe, <HI>The vnbeleeuing Husband is sanctified by the wife, and the vnbeleeuing wife is sanctified by the Hus∣bande: else were your Children vncleane: but now are they holy.</HI> When the Disciples rebuked those that brought little Children to Christ, that he might touch them, he saide, <HI>Suffer the little children to come vnto mee, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 10.</NOTE> <HI>forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of GOD.</HI> And againe, <HI>Their Angelles al∣waies beholde the face of my Father which</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 10.</NOTE> <HI>is in Heauen.</HI> The kingdome of Heauen is of such, saieth <HI>Christ:</HI> not onelie then of those, but of other like infantes, which shall bee in al times.</P>
<P>As God tooke the seede of <HI>Abraham</HI> to be partakers of the couenant whiche hee gaue to <HI>Abraham:</HI> so hee appoynted that euerie man childe of eyght dayes olde shoulde bee circum∣cised. And <HI>Abraham circumcised his sonne</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Isaac, when he was eyght dayes old, as God
<PB REF="139"/>
had commanded him.</HI> May wee thinke, that the promise of God hath an ende, so that it rea∣cheth not to our children? Or might the chil∣dren of the Iewes receiue the signe of the coue∣nant, and may not the children of the Christiās? Whatsoeuer was promised to <HI>Abraham,</HI> the same is also perfourmed vnto vs. Wee enioye the same blessinges, and free priuiledge of Gods fauour. <HI>Saint Paule</HI> to the <HI>Galathiās</HI> saith, <HI>Know ye, that they whiche are of faith, are</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3.</NOTE> <HI>the children of Abraham.</HI> Againe, <HI>If yee bee Christs, then are ye Abrahams seed, &amp; heires by promise.</HI></P>
<P>Nowe is the signe of the Couenaunt also chaunged, and Baptisme is in steede of Cir∣cumcision, as <HI>Saint Paule</HI> declareth, and cal∣leth them circumcised, which are baptized, <HI>In whome</HI> (meaning Christe) <HI>also yee are cir∣cumcised,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colos. 2.</NOTE> <HI>with circumcision made with∣out handes, by putting off the sinful bodie of the fleshe, through the circumcision of Christ, in that you are buried with him tho∣row baptisme.</HI> Our Sauiour giueth charge to his Apostles, to baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the sonne, and of the holy ghost. The Apostles baptized not only such as professed their beliefe, but whole housholdes. The <HI>keeper of y<SUP>•</SUP> prisō was baptized with all</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 16.</NOTE> <HI>that belonged vnto him.</HI> So was <HI>Crispus</HI> the chiefe ruler of y<SUP>•</SUP> Synagogue, &amp; his housholde,
<PB REF="140"/>
and the housholde of <HI>Stephanas.</HI> Infantes are a parte of the Churche of God: they are the sheepe of Christ, and belong to his flocke. Why shoulde they not beare the marke of Christe: they haue the promise of saluation: Why should they not receiue the seale whereby it is confir∣med vnto them: they are of the felowshippe of the faithfull: <HI>Augustine</HI> saith, <HI>Vbi ponis par∣uulos non baptizatos? profecto in numero cre∣dentium. Where place you young children,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De verbis A∣post. Ser. 14.</NOTE> <HI>which are not yet baptised? Verily in the number of them that beleeue.</HI> Why then shoulde not they be partakers of the sacrament together with the faithfull:</P>
<P>And as the children of the faithfull by right ought to be baptized: So such others also as were borne of vnbeleeuing parents, and were aliants from the common wealth of Israel, and were strangers from the couenant of promise, and had no hope, if they acknowledge the er∣rour in which they liued, and seeke the forgiue∣nesse of their former sinnes, may well receiue this sacrament of their regeneration. So when they which heard <HI>Peter were pricked in their heartes,</HI> and saide to <HI>Peter</HI> and the other Apo∣stles, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Men and brethren what shal wee doe? <HI>Peter</HI></HI> said vnto thē, <HI>Amend your liues, and be baptized euery one of you in the Name of Iesus Christ, for the remissiō of sinnes,</HI> They were buried with Christ by Baptisme into his
<PB REF="140"/>
death, and made partakers of his blood, and continued in the Apostles doctrine and fellow∣shippe.</P>
<P><HI>Christ,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>loued the Church,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 5.</NOTE> <HI>and gaue himselfe for it, that he might sanc∣tifie it and clense it by the washing of water through the word.</HI> Againe, <HI>According to his mercie hee saued vs by the washing of the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3.</NOTE> <HI>newe birth, and the renewing of the holye Ghost.</HI> For this cause is baptisme called salua∣tion, life, regeneration, the forgiuenes of sinnes, the power of God to resurrection, the Image and pledge of resurrection, and the weede of immortalitie. And yet are not these thinges wrought by the water: for then what neede had wee of Christ? what good did his passion? what doeth the holie Ghost woorke in our heartes? what power or force is lefte to the woorde of God:</P>
<P><HI>Augustine</HI> saith, <HI>Quare non ait, mundi estis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tract. 80. in Ioh.</NOTE> <HI>propter Baptismum quo loti estis: nisi quia etiam in aqua verbum mundat? detrahe verbum, &amp; quid est aqua nisi aqua? Why doth not Christ say, nowe ye are cleane, because of the Bap∣tisme wherewith ye are washed: sauing that because in the water it is the word that ma∣keth cleane? take away the worde, and what is water more then water?</HI> It is the couenant, and promise, and mercie of God which clotheth vs with immortalitie, assureth our resurrecti∣vn,
<PB REF="141"/>
by whiche wee receiue regeneration, for∣giuenesse of sinnes, life, and saluation. His woorde declareth his loue towardes vs: and that woorde is sealed and made good by Bap∣tisme. Our faith which are baptized, and our continuance in the profession whiche wee haue made, establisheth in vs this grace which wee receiue. As it is sayde, <HI>Ʋerus Baptismus con∣stat non tam &amp;c. True Baptisme standeth</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deconsecrat. dist. 4. Verus.</NOTE> <HI>not so much in washing of the bodie, as in the faith of the heart.</HI> As the Doctrine of the Apostles hath taught vs, saying, <HI>By Faith</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 15.</NOTE> <HI>purifiyng their heartes.</HI> And in another place, <HI>Baptisme saueth vs, not the putting a∣way</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 3.</NOTE> <HI>of the filth of the flesh, but the exami∣ning of a good conscience before God, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ.</HI> Therefore <HI>Hierom</HI> saith, <HI>They that receiue not Baptism</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Eze. ca. 16.</NOTE> <HI>with perfect faith, receiue the water, but the holie Ghost they receiue not.</HI></P>
<P>The water wherein wee are baptized, doeth not clense the soule: But <HI>the blood of Iesus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Iohn 1.</NOTE> <HI>Christ</HI> his sonne <HI>doth clense vs from al sinne.</HI> Not the water, but the blood of Christ recon∣cileth vs vnto GOD, strengtheneth our con∣science, and worketh our redemption. We must seeke saluation in Christ alone, and not in any outwarde thing. Hereof saith <HI>Cyprian, Remissio peccatorum, siue per Baptismum, siue per alia Sa∣cramenta</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyp. de Bap∣tis. Christi.</NOTE> <HI>donetur, propriè spiritus sancti est. Ver∣borum
<PB REF="141"/>
solennitas &amp;c. The remission of sinnes, whether it be giuen by baptisme, or by anie other Sacraments, do properly appertain to the holy ghost. The solennitie of the words, and the inuocation of Gods holy Name, &amp; the outwarde signes appointed to the mini∣sterie of the Priest by the institution of the Apostles, worke the visible outward Sacra∣ment. But, touching the substance therof, it is the holy Ghost that worketh it. Saint Am∣brose</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. de Sac. cap. 3.</NOTE> also saith, <HI>Vidisti fontem, vidisti sacerdotē &amp;c. Thou hast seene the water, thou hast seen the Priest, thou hast seen those things, which thou mightest see with the eies of thy body, and by such sight as man hath: but those things which worke &amp; doe the deede of saluation, which no eye can see, thou hast not seene.</HI></P>
<P>Such a change is made in the sacrament of baptisme. Through y<SUP>t</SUP> power of Gods working, the water is turned into blood. They y<SUP>t</SUP> bee wa∣shed in it, receiue the remission of sinnes: their robes are made cleane in the blood of the lambe. The water it selfe is nothing: but by the wor∣king of Gods spirit, the death and merits of our Lorde and Sauiour Christ, are thereby assured vnto vs.</P>
<P>A figure heereof was giuen at the redde Sea. The children of Israel passed through in safetie: but Pharao and his whole armie
<PB REF="142"/>
were drowned. Another figure heereof was giuen in the Arke. The whole worlde was drowned, but Noah and his familie were saued aliue: Euen so in the fountaine of Bap∣tisme, our spirituall Pharao the Deuill, is choked: his armie, that is, our sinnes are drowned, and we saued. The wicked of the worlde are swallowed in concupiscence, and vanities, and wee abide safe in the Arke: GOD hath chosen vs to bee a peculiar peo∣ple to himselfe, wee walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirite, therefore wee are in Christe Iesus, and there is nowe no condemnation vn∣to vs.</P>
<P>Nowe, touching the Minister of this Sa∣crament, whether hee bee a good man or an euil man, godly or godlesse, an heretike or a Catho∣like, an Idolater or a true worshipper of God: the effect is all one, the value or woorthinesse of the Sacrament dependeth not of man, but of God. Man pronounceth the worde, but GOD setleth our heartes with grace: man toucheth or washeth vs with water, but God maketh vs cleane by the Crosse of Christ. It is not the mi∣nister, but Christ himselfe whiche is the Lambe of GOD that taketh away the sinnes of the worlde.</P>
<P>Againe, whether the infant be signed with y<SUP>t</SUP> signe of the crosse, or be put into the water once
<PB REF="142"/>
or thrise, whether one or two or three, or more be Godfathers, or witnesses of the Baptisme, it maketh nothing to the vertue of the sacrament, they are no part thereof: without these, baptisme is whole and perfect. Hereof <HI>Gregorie</HI> saith, <HI>In vna fide nihil officit consuetudo Ecclesiae diuersa.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. lib. 1. Epist. 41.</NOTE> <HI>The Faith beeing one, the diuersitie of cu∣stomes hurteth nothing.</HI> Christ left no order for the vse of these thinges, neither did by his word or example require them. The Church of God hath libertie to dispose herein, as may bee most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting for decencie and godlines.</P>
<P>Some make doubt of those infantes the chil∣dren of the faithfull, which depart before bap∣tisme, whether they be saued or not. What, shal wee say that they are damned? It is a hard mat∣ter, and too curious for man to enter into the iudgements of God: his mercie is infinite, and his purpose secrete, Hee sheweth mercie vnto those, vpon whom hee will haue mercie. Who can appoynt him, or set him an order what hee shall do: It is not good, nor standeth with Chri∣stian reuerence to bee contentious and busie in searching out, or reasoning of matters, which the wisedome of God hath hid from our know∣ledge.</P>
<P>Yet, if any would faine bee resolued: hee may thus safely reason. It is true, that children are borne in sinne, and that by the sinne of one man death hath entred into the worlde, and that the
<PB REF="143"/>
reward of sinne is death: but who knoweth if God haue forgiuen them their sinne? Who is his Counsailour, who knoweth his meaning? Our children are the children of God. Hee is our God, and the God of our seede. They bee vnder the couenant with vs. The sobrest waye is to speake least, and to leaue them to the iudge∣ment and mercie of God.</P>
<P>Howbeit, if any should despise, and of wilful∣nes refuse this holy ordinaunce, so that they woulde in no case bee baptized, or suffer their children to bee baptized: that were damnable. Otherwise the grace of God is not tyed so to the ministration of the sacrament, that if anye be preuented by death, so that he cannot bee re∣ceiued to the felowship thereof, he shoulde there∣fore be thought to bee damned. For many haue suffered death for Gods cause, for their Faith in Christ, who neuer were baptized: yet are they reckoned, and are indeed blessed Martirs. So <HI>Valentinianus</HI> a Christian Emperour died without baptisme: yet doeth <HI>Ambrose</HI> com∣mend him, and nothing doubteth, but that hee <NOTE PLACE="marg">Orat. de obit. Valentiniani.</NOTE> is saued. Hee saith, <HI>Audiui vos dolere, quod non acceperit &amp;c. I haue heard that you are grie∣ued, because he tooke not the Sacrament of baptisme. Tel me, what other thing is there in vs, but our wil, &amp; our desire?</HI> Againe, <HI>Hee which was endued with thy spirite, O God,
<PB REF="143"/>
how might it be that he should be voyde of thy grace? Or, If this moue you, because the misteries were not solemnly ministred: are not the Martirs crowned if they be only no∣uices (that be not yet christned?) But if they be washed in their blood, then is he also wa∣shed in his godlines and in his desire. S. Au∣gustine</HI> saith, <HI>Hee is not depriued from the partaking and benefit of the sacrament, so</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In serm. ad infantes.</NOTE> <HI>long as he findeth in himself that thing, that the sacrament signifieth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Constantinus</HI> the great, was the first Christi∣an Emperour: yet was not baptized vntill the time of his death. <HI>Qui, cum Nicomediae ageret,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. tripart. lib. 3, cap. 12.</NOTE> (saith <HI>Theodoretus) lāguore grauatus, nec igno∣rans vitae huius incertum, gratiam baptismatis est adeptus. Who, when he was at Nicomedia, being grieuously sick, and knowing the vn∣certeinty of this life, was baptised.</HI> The theef vpon the crosse, was not baptized: Yet Christe saide vnto him, this day thou shalt bee with mee in Paradise. The Prophete <HI>Ieremie,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Bapt.</HI> were sanctified in their mothers wombes. By these fewe it may appeare, that the sacra∣ment maketh not a Christian, but is a seale &amp; as∣surāce vnto all y<SUP>t</SUP> receiue it of the grace of God, vnlesse they make themselues vnworthy thereof: And y<SUP>t</SUP> no man may despise this holy ordinance, &amp; keepe backe his infants frō baptisme, for in so doing he procureth his own dānation. In time
<PB REF="144"/>
of ignorance manie could see this, and acknow∣ledge it, that the outwarde baptisme by water was not necessarie vnto saluation, so that the children or others that died without it, were for lacke thereof damned. The church hath alwayes receiued three sortes of Baptisme: the Baptisme of the spirit, or of blood, or of water, If any were preuented by death, or hindered by crueltie or persecution, so that they coulde not receiue the sacrament of Baptisme at the hands of the minister, yet haueing the sanctification of the holie Ghost, or making their faith knowne by their suffering, they were borne a newe, and baptized. God hath his purpose in vs and our children. Before we be borne, when we had dōe neither good nor euil, he hath mercie and com∣passion on vs. Iudgement appertaineth vnto God. He knoweth who are his. No man know∣eth the thinges of God, but the sprite of God onely. And thus much of the Sacrament of Baptisme, which is the badge and cognisance of euery Christian. If any bee not baptised, but lac∣keth the marke of Gods folde, wee cannot dis∣cerne him to be one of the flocke. If anie take not the seale of regeneration, we cannot say, he is borne the childe of God. This is the ordinarie way, let vs vse it, let vs not despise, nor foreslow to receiue the Sacraments: they are the meanes by which God maketh sure his good will to∣wardes vs.</P>

It shall not bee amisse, to speake a worde or two, of the naming of your children.

The other Sacrament of Christes Church, is the sacrament of the Lordes Supper, whiche some haue called the Sacrament of the Altar: some the Sacrament of the holie table: some the Sacrament of bread and wine: but wee most properly may call it the sacrament of the bodie and blood of Christ. And that we wander not at large, but may stande in certaine ground, I wil expounde those words of our Sauiour, <HI>This is my bodie:</HI> and, <HI>this is my blood of the newe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.</NOTE> <HI>testament, that is shed for manie: for the re∣mission of sinnes.</HI></P>
<P>This matter these two or three hundreth yeeres late past, hath beene encumbred with ma∣nie questions and much controuersie. Some saie, the woordes are plaine. Christe him selfe spake them: hee is almightte, and can doe what soeuer hee will: hee hath not spoken otherwise then hee meant: If wee expounde them by signes and figures, wee take away the force of the holy mysterie, and make nothing of it: the woordes muste bee taken euen as they lye, they must not haue any other construction. There∣fore at this day, many wise men, which yeelde from other pointes of superstition, and in many other thinges receiue the truth, stand here, and sticke at this, and cannot yeeld.</P>
<P>I will declare the whole matter simplye, and plainely, and submit my selfe to the vnder∣standing
<PB REF="146"/>
and capacitie of all men. That which I will vtter heerein shall not be of my selfe, but of the Fathers of the Churche: not of those whiche haue beene of later yeeres: but of the most auncient: not of the Heretiques<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: but of the most Catholique, which euer haue beene the enemies and confounders of Heretiques. I wil shewe the vse, and order, and faith of the Primi∣tiue Churche whiche was in the times of the Apostles, and of <HI>Tertullian, Ciprian, Basill, Nazianzene, Hierome, Augustine, Chryso∣stome,</HI> and others Catholique and godly lear∣ned Fathers. Let no man regarde mee, or my speeche: I am onely a finger: these are cleare and bright starres. I doe but shewe them vnto you, and poynt them, that you maye beholde them. God giue vs grace that wee may see them truely, and by them bee able to guyde, and to direct our waye. let vs laie aside all conten∣tion, and quietly heare that shall bee spoken. Whatsoeuer shall bee saide, if it bee true, if it bee auncient, if it be Catholique, if it bee so cleere, as the sunne beames, let vs humble our heartes, and beleeue it. There is no trueth, but of God. Whosoeuer resisteth the truth, resi∣steth God.</P>
<P>First, I will shewe you, that we doe truelie and indeede eate the bodie of Christ, and drinke his blood. And this shall be the foundation, and key of entraunce into all the rest.</P>
<P><PB REF="147"/>
Secondely, I will open these woordes. <HI>This is my body:</HI> and there, howe, by what sort, in what sense and meaning, the bread is the body of Christ. Thirdly, that the bread abideth still in former nature and substance as before: euen as the nature and substance of water remayneth in Baptisme. Fourthly, how the body of Christ is eaten: whether by faith or with the mouth of our bodie: and how the body of Christ is present in the Sacrament.</P>
<P>Fiftly, What difference is betweene the bo∣dy of Christ, and the Sacrament of the body of Christ. Sixtly, howe wee ought to prepare our mindes, and with what faith, and deuotion wee must come to the receiuing thereof.</P>
<P>Wee saie, and beleeue, that wee receiue the body and blood of Christ truelie, and not a fi∣gure or signe: but euen that bodie whiche suf∣fered death on the crosse, and that blood which was shed for the forgiuenes of sinnes. So saieth Christ, <HI>My fleshe is meate in deede, and my</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 6.</NOTE> <HI>blood is drinke indeede.</HI> And againe, <HI>Except yee eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drink his blood, ye haue no life in you.</HI> And againe, <HI>He that eateth me, euen he shall liue, by me.</HI> Wee say, there is no other substantiall foode of our soules: and that hee is diuided a∣mong all the faithfull: and that hee is voyde of saluation, and the grace of Christ, whosoeuer is not partaker of his body and blood. This we
<PB REF="147"/>
say, and may not flee from it hereafter.</P>
<P>Yet, least happily any should be deceiued, we say this meate is spirituall, and therefore it must be eaten by faith, and not with the mouth of our bodie. <HI>Augustine</HI> saith, <HI>Vt quid paras dentes &amp;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tract. 25. in Ioh.</NOTE> <HI>ventrem? crede, &amp; manducasti. Why preparest thou thy teeth, and thy bellie? beleeue, and thou hast eaten.</HI> And againe, <HI>Nolite fauces pa∣rare,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Serm. 23. in Lucam.</NOTE> <HI>sed cor. Prepare not your iawes, but your heart.</HI> As material bread nourisheth our bodie, so doeth the bodie of Christ nourishe our soule, and is therefore called bread. <HI>Deus panis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Confess. lib. 1.</NOTE> <HI>intus est animae meae,</HI> saith <HI>Augustine God is the inward bread of my soule.</HI> For wee receiue him, and eate him, and liue by him. But heereof hereafter more at large.</P>
<P>Nowe, let vs consider the wordes of Christ, <HI>This is my body:</HI> &amp;, <HI>this is my blood.</HI> These woordes you say, are plaine, open, easie, and manifest. So are they: yet, albeit they are plaine, they must haue a right construction. The plainest woordes that bee, vnlesse they bee duelie expounded, may breede errour. <HI>S. Iohn</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 1.</NOTE> saith, <HI>The word was made flesh.</HI> These words are plaine: yet of these plaine wordes <HI>Apollina∣ris</HI> did breede an heresie. Christ saith, <HI>My father is greater then I.</HI> His woordes are playne: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 14.</NOTE> yet did the <HI>Arrians</HI> gather thereof an here∣sie, that Christe is not equall with his Fa∣ther. Christe saith of <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist, <HI>This is</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 11.</NOTE>

<HI>Elias, which was to come.</HI> Hee saith not, hee <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 11.</NOTE> doth signifie <HI>Elias,</HI> but, he is <HI>Elias.</HI> The wordes are plaine: yet were there some, that stood in the mayntainance of their erorour therby, and said, that the soule of <HI>Elias,</HI> did abide in <HI>Iohn Baptist.</HI> Christ saith, <HI>If thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out, and cast it from thee.</HI> And, <HI>If thy</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat 18.</NOTE> <HI>hand or foot cause thee to offend, cut them off, &amp; cast them from thee.</HI> The wordes are plaine: yet he meaneth not, that you should pick out your eyes out of your head, nor choppe off your hands or feete from your bodie. <HI>Iohn</HI> saith of Christ, <HI>He wil baptize you with the holie ghost, &amp; with fire.</HI> These words are plaine, yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3.</NOTE> hereof some raised this errour, y<SUP>t</SUP> children at the time of their baptisme, should bee marked in the forehead with a hot burning iron. <HI>S. Paul</HI> saith, <HI>He hath made him to be sinne for vs, which knew no sinne.</HI> The wordes are plaine: Yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 5.</NOTE> Christ neuer sinned. Hee is the Lambe of God, in whom there is no spot. He is hereby sayde to be the sacrifice for sinne. Christ saith, <HI>They two shalbe one flesh.</HI> And, <HI>They are no more two,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 19.</NOTE> <HI>but one flesh.</HI> These wordes are plaine: Yet if you trie the wordes by common sence, it is not so, they are not one, but two of seuerall fleshe. Christ saith, <HI>You are the salt of the earth: you are the light of the worlde.</HI> The wordes are <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6.</NOTE> plaine: yet indeede, the Apostles were neither materiall light, nor materiall salt. Christe saide
<PB REF="148"/>
of <HI>Iudas, One of you is a diuel.</HI> The words are plaine: Yet <HI>Iudas</HI> in nature and substance was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6.</NOTE> not a Diuell.</P>
<P><HI>S.

So he saith, <HI>The rocke was Christ.</HI> So <HI>Moses</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10. Lenit. 17.</NOTE> saith, <HI>The life of al flesh, is his blood.</HI> And so is Christ called a Lambe, a lion, a worme, a way, a bridegrome, a head, a doore, a vine, the light, bread, water, a garment.</P>
<P>These speeches, and infinite others the like, are plaine, open, and euident: yet are they not true, as y<SUP>t</SUP> words sound them, &amp; literally. For Christe is not a Lambe in substāce &amp; nature, but a spiri∣tual Lambe. So is he a spiritual garment, spiri∣tual light, spiritual water, and spiritual bread.</P>
<P>Christ said to <HI>Nicodemus, Except a man bee borne againe, he cannot see the kingdom of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3.</NOTE> <HI>God.</HI> These words are plaine: yet <HI>Nicodemus</HI> mistooke them, and was deceiued, &amp; said, <HI>Howe can a man be borne that is old? can he enter into his mothers wombe again, &amp; be born?</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6.</NOTE> Christ meant y<SUP>e</SUP> spiritual birth of the soule, &amp; the spirit, not y<SUP>t</SUP> natural &amp; corporall birth of y<SUP>e</SUP> body.</P>
<P>And to come neerer to the matter in hande, whē Christ said, <HI>I am</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>bread which is come

This is an harde saying, who can heare it?</HI> And they departed away frō him. Then said Iesus, <HI>The words that I speak vnto you are spirit &amp; life.</HI> Upon occasiō here∣of, <HI>S.

For the things which are seene, are not so to be iudged of: but al mysteries should be consi∣dered with inward eies, that is, spiritually.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, vpon these wordes, <HI>If any man eate</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
<PB REF="149"/>
<HI>of this bread, he shal liue for euer:</HI> he saith, <HI>Pa∣nem vero siue doctrinam hoc in loco, &amp; salutem, &amp; fidem in se, siue corpus suum dicit: vtrum{que} e∣nim animam fortiorē reddit. Hee calleth bread in this place, either doctrine and saluation and faith in him, or els his bodie: For either of these maketh the soule stronger. S. Paul</HI> saith. <HI>He that eateth or drinketh vnworthily,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11.</NOTE> <HI>eateth and drinketh his own dānation.</HI> Dā∣nation is a spiritual thing, which is not receiued in by the mouth, or broken with the teeth.

<P>And these wordes which are so plaine, if they be examined, wil not be so plaine to yeelde the sense, vnto which they are forced.

Here we see, how the wordes are not al so plain, but must haue a reasonable cōsiruction. It is a rule in the law, <HI>In fraudē legis facit, qui ver∣bis</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dell. &amp; Sena∣tusc. &amp; lon. con. contra.</NOTE> <HI>legis saluis, sententiam eius circumuenit.

<P>But what shall be the construction of these wordes, <HI>This is my body?</HI> whose interpretation or iudgement of them shal stand?

former nature and substaunce as before, euen as the nature and substaunce of water remay∣neth in the Sacrament of Baptisme. There are some that saye by vertue of these woordes, <HI>Hoc est corpus meum,</HI> the bread is chaunged in∣to the bodie of Christ, that the substaunce of bread is gone, and nothing remayning, but onely accidentes: that is, a shewe, and appea∣rance, and likenesse of bread. They say, it see∣meth to be the same it was, but it is chaunged: it seemeth to bee bread, but it is not bread: and the wine, by the taste and colour seemeth to be wine, but it is not wine. They say we may not beleeue our eye sight, nor stand to the iudge∣ment of our senses. They say, Christ is almigh∣ty, he spake the word, and al thinges were made: he hath said, <HI>Hoc est corpus meum,</HI> therfore it is now no more bread, but his body: and that this is the faith of the Church, in which we were borne and christned.</P>
<P>In deede, this hath lately beene receiued, as a matter of faith. But if we examine it well, wee shall finde it to bee an errour, and no point of faith. I saye it hath beene receiued of late: for our olde Fathers neuer beleeued it, as I will declare and prooue, and let you see, that it hath not beene the Catholike faith, nor the faith of the Primitiue churche, nor of the A∣postles of Christe, and therefore no faith at all.

But, say they, it is called bread, because it was bread, or because it hath a likenes of bread. A pre∣tie shift, but it wil not helpe. For <HI>S. Augustine</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. ad infāt.</NOTE> saith, <HI>Quod videtis, panis est, &amp; calix: quod vobis etiam oculi renuntiant.

<P>Why, then say you, how came transubstantia∣tion into the Church? How it came in I cannot shew you. The husbandmā, that findeth his field ouergrowen with cockel, and ill weeds, know∣eth not how they come. They grow of thēselues, he soweth them not. But when, or since what time it hath been receiued and allowed of, I wil tel you. It was first determined &amp; enacted in the
<PB REF="156"/>
Councel of <HI>Laterane</HI> vnder Pope <HI>Innocentius</HI> the third, in the time of king <HI>Iohn,</HI> king of Eng∣land, &amp; in the yeere of our Lorde a thousand two hundreth &amp; fifteen, that is, 350 yeres ago, &amp; not before. Then was it first so named, and made a matter of faith, and neuer before. This I speake not of my selfe: they that maintaine that errour confesse it, the most learned, and wisest, &amp; sagest of them say it. And yet then was it no Catholike faith, for it was onely receiued in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the other churches ouer all the worlde re∣ceiued it not, as appeareth by a Councel holden at <HI>Florence.</HI> Therefore, if transubstantiation be a matter of faith, it is a newe late founde faith, and no old and Catholique faith. In the time of our great graundfathers it was not so taken. After∣warde Pope <HI>Honorius</HI> 3. commaunded, that it should be kept vnder a canopie, and that the peo∣ple <NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1226.</NOTE> should worship the sacrament. And after him <HI>Vrbanus</HI> 4. made a newe holie day in honour of <NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1265.</NOTE> it, which he called <HI>corpus Christi</HI> day. And all these thinges haue been done within these fewe yeeres. For before, in the times of <HI>Augustine, Ie∣rome, Chrisostome,</HI> and the old fathers, they were neuer heard of.</P>
<P>But, to returne to that we haue in hand: whe∣ther the bread and wine in the Sacrament re∣mayne in their proper nature. Yes verily: for so is it auouched by our Sauiour, by <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> by <HI>Ignatius, Iustinus, Irenaeus, Origen, Dioni∣sius,
<PB REF="156"/>
Cyprian, Ambrose, Chrisostome, Augustine, Gelasius, Theodoretus, Cirillus, Bertramus,</HI> and <HI>Rabanus.</HI> By so many good and lawfull wit∣nesses it appeareth, that the bread and wine re∣mayne in the same nature and substance, as be∣fore.</P>
<P>I seeke not to astonishe you, by bringing in such a heape of Authors: nor yet to seeke mine owne glorie therby, God is my witnes, and his Christ. If I would seeke mine owne commodi∣tie, I shoulde holde my peace, and not vnfolde these errours, wherewith the Churche of God hath byn disquieted these late yeeres. As for glo∣rie, I haue none in these things: shame come vp∣on them, that seek the glory and commendation of men: our glorie is to discharge our cōscience, and to speake the truth, that wee may be blame∣lesse in the day of our Lord.</P>
<P>And yet in speaking thus of the sacrament of the Lordes supper, and denying the strange and new learning of transubstantiation, and making it knowen, that the bread and wine continue stil, that they were before, we do not conceiue basely or vnreuerently of the sacrament: wee doe not make it a bare or naked token. Let no man bee deceiued. We doe both thinke, &amp; speake soberly, and with reuerence of the holy mysteries. As we cannot cal them more then they are: so may wee not esteeme them lesse then they are by the ordi∣nance and institution of Christ.</P>
<P><PB REF="157"/>
We say, they are changed, that they haue a dignitie and preeminence which they had not before, that they are not now common breade, or common wine, but the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ: a holy mysterie: a couenant betweene Christ and vs: a testimonie vnto our conscience, that Christ is the Lambe of God: a perfite seale, &amp; sufficient warrant of Gods pro∣mises, whereby God bindeth himselfe to vs, and we stand likewise bounden vnto God, so as God is our God, and we are his people.</P>
<P>In Baptisme, the nature &amp; substance of wa∣ter doth remaine stil: and yet is not it bare wa∣ter. It is changed, &amp; made the sacrament of our regeneration. It is water consecrated, &amp; made holy by the blood of Christ. They which are wa∣shed therein, are not washed with water, but in the blood of the vnspotted Lambe. One thing is seene, and an other vnderstande. Wee see the water, but wee vnderstande the blood of Christ. Euen so wee see the bread and wine, but with the eies of our vnderstanding we looke beyonde these creatures, wee reache our spirituall sen∣ses into heauen, and beholde the raunsome and prise of our saluation. Wee doe beholde in the Sacrament, not what it is, but what it doeth signifie. When wee receiue it with due reue∣rence and faith, we say as sayde <HI>Gregorius Nys∣senus, Ego aliam escam agnosco, quae &amp;c. <HI>I know</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De crea. hom. cap. 20.</NOTE> <HI>another kind of meate, bearing the likenes
<PB REF="157"/>
&amp; resemblāce of our bodily meat, the plea∣sure and sweetnes wherof passeth only into the soule.</HI> It goeth not into the mouth or bel∣ly, but onelie into the soule, and it feedeth the minde inwardly, as the other outwardly feedeth the body.</P>
<P>We say as <HI>S. Aug. Ipse est panis cordis nostri.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Psa 48. Ba∣sil. in Psal. 33.</NOTE> <HI>Christ is the bread of our heart.</HI> And as <HI>S. Ba∣sil, Est spirituale os interioris hominis, quo nutri∣tur recipiēs verbū vitae, quod verbū est panis, qui descēdit de coelo. <HI>There is a spiritual mouth of</HI></HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>inner mā, by which he is nourished, by re∣ceiuing (Christ)</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>word of life, whiche is the bread that came frō heauē.</HI> In this mystery of y<SUP>•</SUP> death of Christ, his death &amp; passion is renewed to our remēbrance. We are so moued to sorow, for our sins, which haue bin cause of his death, &amp; to be thākful for y<SUP>e</SUP> great mercy of God, whiche by this meanes wrought our redēption, as if we did see him presēt before our faces hanging vpō y<SUP>e</SUP> crosse. We know y<SUP>•</SUP> Christ hath left his sacra∣ments to his Church, that they might be helpes to lift vs vp into heauē. By them we are ioyned with Christ, and made partakers of his passion.</P>
<P>Next, let vs consider, how and after what sort we eat the body of Christ in the sacrament. And here, I beseech you, that you may take the cōfort of the body &amp; blood of Christ, to giue good eare. For, of mistaking this mystery, grewe the first error in the Church. When y<SUP>•</SUP> disciples of Christ
<PB REF="158"/>
heard Christ speake of this matter, and vnder∣stood him not, they were offended, and shrounke backe, and departed. If we take the wordes of Christ in such meaning as they did, wee shalbee deceiued, and offended as they were.</P>
<P>This it is then which wee haue to consider, whether the bodie of Christ goe into our mouth, and our bodies, as other meates: or whether it be receiued spiritually, as a spirituall meate, and so passe into, and nourishe our soule. Here∣of somewhat was sayde before, by the way, and shortly. But for cleerer vnderstanding of the same, we haue to weigh and declare, that the ea∣ting of the body of Christ, is not grosse, or corpo∣rall, but ghostly and spirituall, as a peculiar worke of the minde.</P>
<P>The trueth hereof is founded in our Creede, and is an article of our Christian faith. Wee be∣leeue that Christ did rise againe from the dead, and ascended into heauen, and sitteth at the right hand of God in glorie. So saith <HI>Saint Paule, <HI>If yee then be risen with Christe, seeke those</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3.</NOTE> <HI>thinges whiche are aboue, where Christ sit∣teth at the right hād of god.</HI> And again <HI>Our conuersation is in heauen, from whence we</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.</NOTE> <HI>also looke for the sauiour, euen the Lord Ie∣sus Christ.</HI> Christ himselfe saith to his disciples, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 16. Ioh. 12.</NOTE> <HI>It is expediēt for you that I goe away.</HI> And, <HI>The poore alwaies ye haue with you, but me yee shall not haue alwayes.</HI> So <HI>S. Peter</HI> saith,
<PB REF="158"/>
<HI>Whom the heauen must conteine, vntil the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 5.</NOTE> <HI>time that al thinges be restored, which God had spoken by the mouth of al his holy pro∣phets since the world began.</HI></P>
<P>Whiche speeches haue occasioned the olde auncient learned Fathers, to teache the people after this sort, touching the body of Christ. <HI>Vi∣gilius</HI> a godlie Bishop and Martyr, saith, <HI>Caro Christi cū esset in terra, nō erat in coelo: &amp; nunc,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Contra Eu∣tych. lib. 2.</NOTE> <HI>quia est in coelo, non est vtique in terra. <HI>The flesh of Christ when it was in earth, was not in heauen: and nowe, because it is in Heauen, doubtlesse it is not in earth.</HI> Ambrose</HI> saith, <HI>Seeke the things that be aboue, and not the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Luc. lib. 10. cap. 24.</NOTE> <HI>things that be vpō earth.

yet notwithstāding euen here is the truth of</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Lord. For the body wherin he rose againe, must needs be in one place.</HI> So <HI>Cirillus</HI> sayd, <HI>Christus non poterat in carne versari cum Apo∣stolis, postquam ascēdisset ad patrē. Christ could</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ciril. in Ioh. lib. 11. cap. 3.</NOTE> <HI>not be conuersant together with his Disci∣ples in his flesh, after he had ascended vnto his father.</HI> It would bee tedious to alleadge all y<SUP>t</SUP> might be saide to like purpose. Thus Christe, and <HI>Paul,</HI> &amp; <HI>Peter:</HI> thus <HI>Vigilius, Ambrose, Au∣gustine, Cirill,</HI> and al the olde Catholique fathers say: and wee are taught to beleeue, that Christ is not corporally in the churche, but is ascen∣ded into Heauen, and that hee hath giuen to his bodie immortalitie, but hath not taken from the same the nature of a bodie. <HI>Vigilius</HI> hauing cause to prooue this same article against <HI>Euti∣ches,</HI> shutteth vp the matter thus: <HI>Haec est fides</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">vig. contra Eutyc. lib. 1.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; professio catholica, quam Apostolitradiderunt, martyres roborauerunt, &amp; fideles huc vsque cu∣stodiunt.

<P>The body then which we eate, is in Hea∣uen: aboue all Angels, and Archangels, and powers, and principalities. Our meate is in Heauen on high, and we are heere belowe on the earth. Howe may it be, that we may reach
<PB REF="159"/>
it, or taste, or eate it? Heere let vs imagine, that there are two men in euery man, and that euerie man is fleshe and spirite, bodie, and soule. This man thus doubled, must bee furnished with double senses: bodily to serue the bodye: and spirituall, to serue the soule. Hee muste haue eyes of the bodie, and eyes of the soule: eares of the bodye, and eares of the soule. Spirituall senses, ars quicke, sharpe, and liuely. They pearce anye thing, bee it neuer so thicke: they reache anye thing, bee it neuer so farre off. Christ saieth of <HI>Abraham, Abra∣ham</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>reioyced to see my daye: hee sawe it, and was gladde.</HI> Hee sawe it, not with his bodylie eyes, but with the inner eyes of the soule.</P>
<P>When we speake of the mysterie of Christe, and of eating his bodie, wee must shut vp and a∣bandon all our bodily senses. And, as wee can∣not say, that wee see him with our bodily eyes, or heare him with our bodilye eares, or touche him with bodily feeling: so likewise can we not, and therefore may wee not saye, wee taste him, or eate him with our badylie mouth. In this woorke wee must open all the inner and spiri∣tuall senses of our soule: so shall wee not onely see his bodye, but heare him, and feele him, and taste him, and eate him. This is the mouth, and the feeling of faith. By the hande of faith
<PB REF="160"/>
we reache vnto him, and by the mouth of Faith we receiue his body.</P>
<P>Touching the eating of Christes bodye, <HI>S. August:</HI> taught the people on this wise. <HI>Crede,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trac. 26. in Iohan.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; manducasti. Credere in Christum, hoc est, mā∣ducare panem viuum. Beleeue in Christ, and thou hast eaten Christ. For, beleeuing in Christ, is the eating of the bread of life.</HI> Be∣leue y<SUP>•</SUP> he is that Lambe of God that taketh away the sins of the world. Beleeue that there is no o∣ther name giuen vnto men, wherein we shall be saued, but y<SUP>t</SUP> name of Iesus Christ. Beleeue that he hath payed the raunsome for the sinnes of the whole worlde. Beleeue that he hath made peace betweene God and man. Beleeue, that it is hee, which hath reconciled all thinges by his blood. Here is nothing to be done by the mouth of the body. Whosoeuer thus beleeueth, hee eateth hee drinketh him.</P>
<P><HI>Clemens</HI> saith, <HI>Hoc est bibere sanguinem Iesu, participē esse incorruptionis eius. This is y<SUP>•</SUP> drin∣king</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In paedag. lib. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>of the blood of Iesus, to be made parta¦ker of his immortality. Tertul.</HI> saith, <HI>He must be receiued in cause of life: hee must be de∣uoured by hearing: he must bee chewed by vnderstāding: he must be digested by Faith.</HI> Thus did Christ himselfe teache his disciples to vnderstād him <HI>The words which I speake are spirit &amp; life. S. Ierom</HI> therfore saith, <HI>Quādo au∣dimus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 6. in Psal. 147.</NOTE> <HI>sermonē domini, caro Christi &amp; sāguis eius
<PB REF="160"/>
in aures nostras infunditur. Whē we heare the worde of God, the flesh of Christ, and his blood is powred into our eares.</HI></P>
<P>The Patriarkes &amp; Prophets, and people of God, which liued before the birth of Christ, did by faith eate his flesh &amp; drinke his blood. <HI>S. Paul</HI> saith, <HI>They did al eat the same spiritual meat,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10.</NOTE> <HI>and did al drink of the same spiritual drink.</HI> Whosoeuer beleeued in Christ, they were nou∣rished by him then, as we are now. They did not see Christ: he was not yet borne: he had not yet a naturall body, yet did they eate his bodie: he had not yet any blood, yet did they drinke his blood. They beleeued that it was he, in whom the pro∣mises should be fulfilled, that he shoulde be that blessed seede, in whom al nations should be bles∣sed. Thus they beleeued, thus they receiued, and did eate his body.</P>
<P>But say some, the fathers of the olde lawe, were in darkenes, in a shadow, &amp; a figure: it was meete they should receiue the Sacrament spiri∣tually, or the body of our Lord spiritually: but al otherwise with vs, vnto whose benefite, y<SUP>t</SUP> sa∣craments of the new Testament work y<SUP>•</SUP> thing it selfe that they signifie: so that we receiue Christ really, bodily, and with the mouth of our bodies.</P>
<P><HI>S. Paule</HI> telleth vs, the fathers of the old lawe did eate the same spirituall meate, that is to say, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tract. 26. in Iohan.</NOTE> the same Christe, that wee eate. So sayeth <HI>S. Augustine, Sacramenta illa fuerunt, in signis
<PB REF="161"/>
diuersa: in rebus quae significabantur, paria. These things were Sacramentes, in the out∣ward tokens diuers, but in the things signi∣fied, all one with ours.</HI> Likewise sayeth <HI>Leo, Mysteria pro temporum ratione variata sunt: quum fides, qua v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uimus nulla fuerit aetate di∣uersa.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De natiui. Dom. ser. 3.</NOTE> <HI>The Sacramentes are altered accor∣ding to the diuersitie of times: but the faith whereby wee liue, was euer in all ages one.</HI> If they did eate the same meate, if the things, that is, the matter of their Sacramentes were all one with ours, if their faith was al one with our faith, what difference is there between their and our eating? As they did eate Christ by faith, and not by the mouth of the bodie: so we eate Christ by faith, and not by the mouth of our bodie.</P>
<P>To make this somewhat more euident, let vs take the iudgement of the Fathers. They teache vs plainely, that the spirituall eating of Christes bodie by faith, is the true eatinge: and that wee doe not grossely, fleshely, real∣ly, or naturally eate him in the Sacrament. <HI>Saint Cyprian</HI> sayeth, the bodie of Christe <HI>est ci∣bus mentis, non ventris. It is meate for the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cypr. de coe∣na Domini.</NOTE> <HI>mynde, not for the belly:</HI> Not for the teeth to chewe, but for the soule to beleeue. <HI>Cyril∣lus</HI> sayeth, <HI>Sacramentum nostrum, hominis mā∣ducationem non asserit, mentes credentium ad</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad obie. The∣odo. anath. 11</NOTE> <HI>Grassas cogitationes irreligiose inducens. Our

Sacrament auoucheth not the eating of a man, leading the mindes of the faithfull in</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In illud Euan. Quicunque dixerit verbū.</NOTE> <HI>vngodly maner to grosse</HI> (or fleshly) <HI>cogi∣tations. Athanasius</HI> saith, <HI>Quot hominibus suffecisset corpus eius, &amp;c. Vnto how many men could Christs body haue sufficed, that he shoulde bee the foode of all the worlde? Therefore hee made mention of his ascen∣sion into heauen, that he might withdrawe them from corporall and fleshly vnderstan∣dyng.</HI> What thinge may bee spoken more playnelye: It were vnpossible his naturall body naturallye receiued, mighte suffice all the worlde: to let them see hee had no suche mea∣nyng, he speaketh of his goyng vp into heauen. Spiritually then, hee is receiued of euerie one, and is digested, and becommeth the nourish∣ment of al the worlde.</P>
<P><HI>S Augustine</HI> expounding these words of Christ, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tract. 26. in Iohn.</NOTE> <HI>Who so eateth of this bread, shall not die,</HI> saith thus, <HI>Quod pertinet ad virtutem sacramē∣ti, non quod pertinet ad visibilile sacramentum. Qui māducat intus, nō foris: qui manducat in cor∣de, non qui premit dente. That pertaineth to</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>vertu &amp; effect of the sacrament, not</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>pertai neth to the visible sacramēt. He that eateth inwardly, &amp; not he</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>eateth outwardly: that eateth with his heart, not that bruseth</HI> (the sacramēt) <HI>with his tooth.</HI> Thus is Christs bo∣die receiued, as these holy fathers say: not to the
<PB REF="162"/>
filling our contentation of the body, not with mouth or tooth, but with spirite and faith, vn∣to the holinesse, and sanctification of the minde. After this sort wee eate his fleshe, and drinke his blood.</P>
<P>Therefore wicked men, and suche as beleeue not, receiue not the bodie of Christe: they haue no portion in it. So saith <HI>Orig Est cibus verus, quem nemo malus potest edere, &amp;c. The bodie</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Orig. in 15. Mat.</NOTE> <HI>of Christ, is the true food, which no euil man can eate: For if the euil man coulde eate the body of our Lord, it should not be writtē, he that eateth this bread shal liue for euer.

Who</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Ioh. tra. 26.</NOTE> <HI>so disagreeth from Christ, neither eateth his bread, nor drinketh his blood: although he daily receiue the sacramēt of so great a thing without difference, to the iudgement of his presumption.</HI> And againe, <HI>Qui in me non ma∣net, &amp;c.

<P><HI>Chrisost.</HI> saith, <HI>Where as the carkeis is, there</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 24. in 1. ad Cor.</NOTE> <HI>are Eagles: The carkasse is</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>body of Christ, in respect of his death. But hee nameth Ea∣gles, to shewe, that who so will approche to this bodie, must mount aloft, and haue no dealing with the earth, nor bee drawen, and creepe downward, but must euermore flee vp, and behold the Sunne of iustice, &amp; haue the eye of his minde quicke and sharpe. For this is a table of eagles,</HI> (that flie on high,) <HI>not of iaies</HI> (that creepe beneath.) So saith <HI>Saint</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. ad Hedi∣biam quaest. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Hierome, Let vs goe vp with the Lorde</HI> (in to heauen) <HI>into that great parlar spread, and cleane: and let vs receiue of him aboue the cuppe of the new Testament.</HI> He saith, They that rise not vp by faith, receiue not the cuppe of Christ. So saith <HI>Hillary, The bread that came</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De trinit. li. 8.</NOTE> <HI>downe from heauen, is not receiued, but of him that hath our Lord, and is the member of Christ,</HI></P>
<P>This is the vndoubted meaning of the olde fathers, that the wicked are not partakers of the passion of Christ, because they lacke faith, whereby onely Christ is receiued of vs. As <HI>Au∣gustine</HI>
<PB REF="163"/>
saith, <HI>How shal I holde Christ beeinge</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tract. in Iohn. 50.</NOTE> <HI>absent? how shal I thruste my hande vp into heauen, that I may holde him sitting there Sende vp thy faith, and thou holdest him.</HI> By this meanes we draw nigh to Christ, we hyde our selues in his woundes, wee sucke at his breast, we feede of his bodie, and comfortablye lay vp in our mynde, that his flesh was crucified and wounded for our sakes.</P>
<P>Nowe let vs examine what difference is be∣tweene the body of Christ, and the sacrament of the bodie. It behoueth vs to take eche part a∣right as it is, least we be deceiued and take one for another. <HI>Origen</HI> saith, <HI>Simpliciores nescien∣tes distinguere. &amp;c. Simple mē, not being able</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In Prolog. in cant.</NOTE> <HI>to discerne what thinges in the Scriptures ought to be applyed to the outwarde man, and what to the inner, beinge deceiued by the likenesse of woords, haue turned them selues to a sorte of peeuishe fables, and vaine fantasies.</HI> Therefore sayeth <HI>Chrysostome, Magnum crede mihi bonum est, scire quid sit creatura, &amp; quid sit Creator, &amp;c. Beleeue me,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">De ieiuniis &amp; lectione Gen.</NOTE> <HI>it is a great matter to vnderstande what is the creature, and what is God the Creator: what are the workes, and what is the work∣man.</HI> The difference heerein is this, A Sacra∣ment is a figure or token: the bodye of Christ is figured or tokened. The Sacrament bread is bread, it is not the bodie of Christ. The bodie
<PB REF="163"/>
of Christ is flesh, it is no bread. The bread is be∣neath, the bodie is aboue. The bread is on the table, the bodie is in heauen. The bread is in the mouth, the bodie in the heart. The bread feedeth the outward man, the bodie feedeth the inwarde man. The bread feedeth the bodie, the body fee∣deth the soule. The bread shall come to nothing: the bodie is immortall, and shall not perish. The bread is vile, the bodie of Christ glorious. Such a difference is there betweene the bread, whiche is a Sacrament of the bodie, and the bodye of Christ it selfe. The Sacrament is eaten as well of the wicked, as of the faithfull: the bo∣die is onely eaten of the faithfull. The Sacra∣ment may bee eaten vnto iudgement: the body can not bee eaten, but vnto saluation. Without the Sacrament we may be saued: but without the bodie of Christ wee haue no saluation, wee can not bee saued. As <HI>Saynt Augustine</HI> saith, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trect. 26. in Ioh.</NOTE> <HI>Quinon sumit carnem Christi, non habet vitam: &amp; qui eam sumit, habet vitam, &amp; eam vtique ae∣ternam. Hee that receiueth not the fleshe of Christ, hath not life: &amp; he that receiueth the same, hath life, and that for euer.</HI></P>
<P>Such a difference maketh <HI>Epiphanius, Hoc est rotundae figurae &amp; insensibile, quantum ad po∣tentiam</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Epiph. in Anchor.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c. This thing</HI> (that is, the sacrament) <HI>is of a rounde forme,</HI> (for it was a great thick round cake) <HI>and touching any power that is in it, vtterly voyde of sense. But wee knowe
<PB REF="164"/>
that our Lord is whole sense, whole sensible, whole God, whole mouing.</HI> Again, <HI>S. August.</HI> saith for the difference of them, <HI>The Sacrament</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tra. 26. in Ioh</NOTE> (of Christs bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>is receiued of some vnto life, of some vnto destruction: but the thing it selfe,</HI> (that is, the flesh of Christ) <HI>wherof this is a Sacrament, is receiued of all men vnto life, and of no man to destruction, whosoeuer shall be partaker of it.</HI></P>
<P>Of the difference which is betweene a figure of any thing, and the thing it self, <HI>Chrysost.</HI> saith, <HI>Audisti fuisse figuram, ne ergo mirare, ne{que} omnia require in typo: Ne{que} enim typus esset, si omnia</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 35. in Gen.</NOTE> <HI>quae veritati accidunt haberentur. Yee haue heard that it was a figure, therefore maruell not, &amp; being a figure, require not al thinges to agree: for otherwise it were no figure.</HI> These and such like reasons no doubte mooued the godly Father to say as wee haue learned to say, <HI>Aliud est Sacramentum, aliud res sacramē∣ti. <HI>The Sacrament is one thing, &amp; the mat∣ter</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trac. 26. in Ioh.</NOTE> <HI>of the Sacrament</HI> (which is Christes verye body) <HI>is another thing.</HI> And therfore he saieth, <HI>Honorem, tanquā religiosa habere possunt: stupo∣rem, tāquam mira nō possūt These things</HI> (spea∣king <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de trinit. lib. 3. cap. 10.</NOTE> of the sacrament of Christes body) <HI>maye haue honour as things appointed to religi∣on: but wonder, as things maruellous, they can not haue.</HI> Thus are wee taught by the Catholique Learned Fathers, to put a diffe∣rence
<PB REF="164"/>
betweene the Sacrament, and the bo∣dy of Christe: and that the one of them is not really lapped vp or shut within the other: that the one (as <HI>Epiphan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> saith) is vtterly voyde of sense: the other, whole sense and whole sensible: that the one is receiued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> destruction vnto some, as <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith: the other is receiued of all men vnto life: That the one is a figure, as <HI>Chrysostome</HI> sayth: the other a trueth.</P>
<P>It remayneth, that wee consider howe wee ought to prepare our heartes: and with what faith, and reuerence wee shoulde resorte to these holy mysteries. Wee may not come, as we vse to doe to our vsuall meates. For here, in a mystery and Sacrament of bread, is set be∣fore vs the bodie of Christe our Sauiour: and his blood in the Sacrament of Wine. Wee see one thing, wee must conceiue another thing. Therefore we must in such manner be affected, as if we were present to beholde his death vpon the crosse, and the sheading of his blood for our sinnes.</P>
<P>Let vs set before our eyes that dreadfull tra∣gedie, and the causes and effectes of his death: that so our heartes may bee the rather mooued to yeelde that allegeance, obedience, and reue∣rence, which is due. Wee were the children of wrath, the enemies of God, shut vp vnder sinne, and the heires of euerlasting damnation. In
<PB REF="165"/>
this case God so loued y<SUP>•</SUP> world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, y<SUP>•</SUP> whosoeuer beleeueth in him shoulde not perishe, but haue life euerla∣sting. And as <HI>Saint Paule</HI> sayeth, <HI>God sent his</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>owne Sonne in the similitude of sinful flesh, and by sinne co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emned sinne in the fleshe.</HI> There was no other thing in He auen or earth, which woulde be taken for our ransome. There∣fore was the Sonne of GOD brought before the Iudge, and arraigned as a Theefe, and condemned, and scourged, and put to death: his side was opened with a speare, and the bloode flowed out: and he sayde, It is finished: that is to say, the price for man is nowe payed. Thus, <HI>beeing in the fourme of God, hee thought it no robberie to bee equall with God: but</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.</NOTE> <HI>he made himselfe of no reputation, &amp; tooke on him the fourme of a seruaunt, and was made like vnto men, &amp; was founde in shape as a man. He humbled himself, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Crosse.</HI> Hee gaue his bodye to bee cruci∣fied, and his blood to bee shedde for our sakes. There was no other sacrifice left for sinne: woe worth the sinne of man, that was the cause of the death of Christ.</P>
<P>What were the effects of his death? What followed? <HI>God hath highly exalted him, and giuē him a name aboue euery name, that at</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the name of Iesus should euery knee bowe:
<PB REF="165"/>
and that euerie tongue should confesse that Iesus Christ is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</HI> God spake out of the heauens, and saide, This is my beloued sonne, in whom I am well pleased. Hee crowned him with glorie and honour: hee hath not onely aduanced Christ, but vs also together with him, <HI>And made vs sitte together in heauenly places in Christ Iesus:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Hee hath made vs like to the Image of his sonne.</HI> Thus hath hee made vs an acceptable people, and hath renewed the face of the earth: so y<SUP>•</SUP> nowe hee saith not, as he did to Adam, thou art earth, and shalt returne to earth: but he saith: Thou art heauen, an immortall and vndefiled inheritance that fadeth not away, is reserued in heauen for thee. This is the effect, and value of the death of Christ.</P>
<P>All these thinges are layde before vs in the holy Table, if wee haue eyes to see and beholde them. There may wee see the crucifiyng of his bodie, and the shedding of his blood, as it were in a glasse. Therefore Christe sayeth, doe this in remembraunce of mee: in remembraunce of my benefite wrought for you: in remembrance of your saluation purchased by me. <HI>Saint Paul</HI> saith, <HI>As often as ye shal eate this bread, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11.</NOTE> <HI>drinke this cuppe, ye shew the Lordes death til he come.</HI></P>
<P>In this supper, lieth a hiddē mystery, There is the horror of sinne, there is y<SUP>e</SUP> death of our Lorde
<PB REF="166"/>
for our sinne represented, howe he was woun∣ded for our sinnes, and tormented for our ini∣quities, and ledde as a lambe to the slaughter. There may we see the shame of the crosse: the darkenesse ouer the worlde: the earth to quake: the stones to cleaue asunder: the graues to open, and the dead to rise. These thinges may we see in the Supper: this is the meaning of these ho∣ly mysteries.</P>
<P>Therefore, let euery one examine him selfe, and search and weigh his owne hearte, whether he be the childe of GOD, and a member of the bodie of Christe: and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cuppe. The sacrament of the Lordes Supper, is a holie foode, the seale of our Faith, the assuraunce of Gods pro∣mises, and a couenant betweene God and man. He that doeth vn worthely thrust himselfe to this table, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation. When a sicke man, of a weake and feeble sto∣macke, sitteth downe to eate with them that are whole, whatsoeuer he eateth or drinketh, it doth increase his sicknesse. To them that perish, the worde of God is a sauour of death vnto death. Who so disagreeth from Christ, neither eateth his bread, nor drinketh his blood, as saith <HI>S. Au∣gustine.</HI></P>
<P>If any of vs come to the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ, and yet make our selues the members of the Diuell, wee treade Christe
<PB REF="166"/>
vnder our feete, we regarde not his body cruci∣fied, nor his blood shed for vs, we regard not the price of our saluation, wee are guiltie of his death, we betraie the innocent blood, we are fal∣len from grace, and Christ hath died in vaine for vs.</P>
<P>Let vs remember Christ was forsaken, scor∣ned, buffeted, crucified, and left vpon the crosse: he was a worme and no man, a reproch among men. Nature it selfe yearned and yelded at the sight hereof. The whole lande grewe darke, the earth did quake, the sunne lost his light, the powers of heauen were moued, the rockes were clouen, the vaile of the temple rent, the thiefe re∣pented, &amp; said, Lorde remember me when thou cōmest into thy kingdome: the centurion glo∣rified God, and said, of a suretie this man was iust.</P>
<P>Where is the power of Christs death now? Where is the force and power of his word? By these meanes he speaketh to thee, and calleth, saying, Beholde, O man, thus haue I sought thee: these things I suffer for thy sake, that thou shouldest eate my flesh, and drinke my blood, &amp; be made one with me: that thou mightest come into mee, and I into thee. I haue made thee a member of my bodie, bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. Thou that wallowest in thy sinnes, thou <HI>Sodoma,</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> thou childe of de∣struction, which hast reioysed in my shame, and
<PB REF="167"/>
arte not moued with the paines which I haue suffered, what might I do for thy sake, to saue thee, that I haue not done? What might I suf∣fer, and haue not endured it? O be a partener of my death, that thou matest haue part in my resurrection.</P>
<P>Let vs die with Christ, let vs bee crucified vnto the worlde. Let vs bee holy Egles, and scare aboue. Let vs goe vp into the great par∣lar, and receiue of our Lorde the cup of the newe testament. There let vs beholde the bodie that was crucified for vs, &amp; the blood which was shead for vs. There let vs say, this is the raun∣som of the world: this was once offered, &amp; hath made perfect for euer al them that beleue: this entered once into the holy place, and obtained e∣uerlasting redemption for vs: this standeth al∣waies in the presence of God, &amp; maketh inter∣cession for vs: this is the Lambe of God, that ta∣keth away the sinnes of the world: by this bodie I am now no more earth &amp; ashes: by this, I am now not a bondman, but made free. This bodie hath broken the gates of hell, &amp; hath opened hea∣uen. In this are all the treasures of Gods mer∣cie by this the prince of darkenes is cast foorth, in this bodie shall he come againe to iudge the quicke and the dead.</P>
<P>Let no vncleane or filthie person, no adulte∣rer, no vsurer, no cruel extortioner, or deuourer of Gods people, offer him selfe to the receiuing
<PB REF="167"/>
of this Sacrament. If any bee such a one, I re∣quire hym by the body &amp; blood of Iesus Christ, and by the iudge of the quicke and the dead, that he come not to the Lordes table: that he betraie not the sonne of God. It were better he had ne∣uer bene borne, and that a milstone were hanged about his necke, &amp; he throwne into y<SUP>e</SUP> sea. Let vs not deceiue our selues: God wil not be mocked. He receiueth dānation, y<SUP>t</SUP> receiueth vnworthely.</P>
<P>Let vs fall downe before our Lorde, and giue thankes vnto hym: Let vs say, what shall I giue vnto the Lord, for al that he hath giuen vnto me? I wyl take the cup of saluation, &amp; call vpon the name of the Lord. Let vs say, O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the world. Let vs say, prayse the Lord, O my soule, and all that is within me, prayse his holy name. Let vs pur∣pose, and promise amendement of our lyfe: let vs goe out with <HI>Peter,</HI> and weepe: let vs fall at Christes feete with <HI>Marie Magdalene,</HI> and with our teares washe his feete: Let vs saye with <HI>Dauid,</HI> I haue sinned to the Lorde: Let vs saye with the Prodigal sonne, father, I haue sinned agaynst heauen and against thee, I am no more worthy to bee called thy sonne: Let vs saye, haue mercy on mee O God, accor∣dyng to thy great mercie: thou art my God, I am thy seruāt. O saue me for thy mercies sake. Let vs offer vp our bodies, a liuing, pure, holy, and acceptable sacrifice to God. So shall we be
<PB REF="168"/>
partakers of the death of Christ, and of his re∣surrection. Thus haue we briefly gone through the whole matter of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, and followed the same or∣der which was set down. First that we do in the Sacramente truely eate the bodie of Christ. Secondly, what is the meaning of the wordes, <HI>Hoc est corpus meum.</HI> Thirdely, whether y<SUP>•</SUP> bread remeaine in nature &amp; substance, Fourthly, whe∣ther it be eaten with the mouth of the bodie, or by faith onely. Fiftly, what difference is be∣tweene the bodie of Christ, and the mysticall signes. Sixtly, howe we must be prepared, and with what deuotiō we ought to come to receiue this Sacrament.</P>
<P>Hauing thus treated of the Sacramentes of the newe testament, and said so much as is need∣full for you to knowe of them both, as well of Baptisme, which is the sacrament of our rege∣neration, as of our Lordes supper, which is the sacrament of our refection or nourishment: I will now in fewe wordes speake something of <HI>confirmation, of matrimony of ecclesiastical ministerie,</HI> which some call holy orders, <HI>of re∣pentance or penance, and of extreme vnctiō</HI> which some of late yeeres haue called Sacra∣ments, and by ioyning these to the other, haue made vp the nomber of seuen Sacramentes, &amp; so haue charged the Church with fiue sacramēts more then Christ did euer ordaine.</P>
<P><PB REF="168"/>
For these fiue, wante either the worde, or the element, or both: and therefore may not bee ta∣ken for true sacraments. Such as haue with all their skil shewed them selues helpers and fur∣therers of our aduersaries. yet haue plainely cō∣fessed that they are not sacraments of Christes institution: <HI>Alexander</HI> of <HI>Hales,</HI> saith of confir∣mation. <HI>The sacrament of confirmation, as it is a Sacrament, was not ordained either by Christ or by the Apostles, but afterwarde in the Counsel of Melda:</HI> Which Counsel was kept many yeres after Christ. And <HI>Durandus</HI> saith of matrimonie, <HI>Matrimonie in due and proper kinde of speach, is no Sacramēt.</HI> And <HI>Bessarion a Cardinal,</HI> cōfesseth (as it was shew∣ed before) that in due and right consideration, none of these fiue may be called Sacramentes: <HI>We reade</HI> (saith he) <HI>that these two onely Sa∣cramentes, were deliuered vs plainely in the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>First, of Confirmation, which is so called because that which was done on our behalfe in baptisme, is ratified and confirmed, many pa∣rentes had not such due care as they ought in the godly bringing vp of their childrē: so that many children knew not whether they were baptized or no: many were neuer taught what couenant was made betweene them &amp; God in their bap∣tisme: many swarued away from Christian profession, and caried them selues to the fellow∣ship
<PB REF="169"/>
of the heathens: and of the sonnes of God, became the sonnes of the deuel. Upon this oc∣casion, the Churche of God laieth charge vpon the parentes, and the witnesses of the baptizing of younge children, that they teach thē the waies of the Lorde, &amp; to know y<SUP>e</SUP> holy mystery that they haue receiued, and what they haue promised and professed in baptisme: that they put them in minde, howe God hath called them out of the kingdome of darknes, vnto his wonder∣full light, and to the fellowship of the saintes in light.</P>
<P>When the children of the Christiās were thus brought vp, &amp; had learned the religyō of Christ, and to walke in the waies of Godlines, they were brought to the church, &amp; by their parents presented vnto the Bishop: and yeeled a reason of their faith openly, before the whole congre∣gation: they professed they would so beleue, that they would liue and die in that faith. Then the Bishop and all the people fell downe on their knees, and prayed vnto God, that he would con∣tinue the good thing hee had begonne, and the bishop laying his hande vpon them, cōmended them vnto God. This was the ratifying of the professiō which they made by others at their bap∣tisme, and for that cause called <HI>Confirmation.</HI></P>
<P>Now, whether it be a sacrament: and when I say a sacrament, I meane a ceremonie com∣manded by God in expresse wordes: For God
<PB REF="169"/>
onely hath the authorytie to institute a Sacra∣ment. Sacraments are confirmations, &amp; seales of the promises of God, and are not of the earth, but from heauen. As Christ saith, <HI>The babtisme</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 21.</NOTE> <HI>of Iohn Whence was it? from heauen or of men? Chrysostome</HI> saith, The misterie were not of God, nor perfect, if thou shouldest put any thing to it. Marke, and iudge, &amp; your selues shal see, whether this were a sacrament instituted by Christ. <HI>Augustine</HI> said, <HI>Accedat verbum ad ele∣mentum, &amp; fit sacramentum. Ioine the worde to the creature, &amp; it is made a sacrament.</HI></P>
<P>This creature or element is visible, as are wa∣ter, bread &amp; wine. The word which must be ioy∣ned, is the commandemēt, &amp; institution of christ: without the word, and the commandement and institution, it is no sacrament.</P>
<P>I protest y<SUP>t</SUP> the vse and order of confirmation rightly vsed, is profitable, and necessarie in the Church, &amp; no way to be broken. But all y<SUP>t</SUP> is pro∣fitable, &amp; necessarie, is not a sacramēt. Christ did not commāde it, he spake no word of it. Looke, and reade, if you doubt it. Christes wordes are written, and may be seene. You shal neuer finde that hee commanded <HI>Confirmation,</HI> or that hee euer made any special promise to it. Therefore may you conclude, that it is no sacrament. O∣therwise, being rightly vsed, it is a good cere∣monie, &amp; wel ordeined of our auncient fathers.</P>
<P>The Apostles layde their handes on them,
<PB REF="170"/>
and confirmed them which were baptized of <HI>Iohn▪</HI> But that proueth not this confirmation: that was extraordinarie, it was a miracle. The holy Ghost came downe vpon them, and lighte∣ned their hearts by this laying on of the Apo∣stles handes. But it is not so nowe, the holy Ghost doth not now descende in visible forme vpon those which are confirmed: there is no such miracle wrought. There is no neede, that it should so be. There was no commandement, ei∣ther to appoint it vnto the Church, or to conti∣nue it vntyl the comming of Christ, and the end of the worlde. Therefore it is no Sacrament by the institution of Christ, Hitherto of the vse: Now, somewhat of the abuse.</P>
<P>Nothing so good and holy, but it may be a∣bused. The worde of God hath bene abused to Heresies, to Necromancie, to Charmes, and Sorcerie, and Witchcrafte. The supper of the Lord was abused in y<SUP>•</SUP> time of <HI>S. Paul.</HI> He telleth the <HI>Corinthians, This is not to eate the Lords Supper.</HI> Lesse marueile then, if this happen to <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11.</NOTE> a ceremonie. Time rusteth and consumeth all things, &amp; maketh many a thing to proue naught in the ende, which was first deuised for good. The brasen Serpent, at the first was made by <HI>Moses,</HI> and set it vp for good purpose. But, after warde it was abused: The children of Israel did burne incense vnto it, and therefore <HI>Ezechias</HI> brake it in pieces.</P>
<P><PB REF="170"/>
The first abuse in confirmation was, that it was done in a strange tongue, y<SUP>•</SUP> no man might vnderstand what was ment. Then, that they receiued to confirmation such children, and so young, as were not able to make profession of their faith: so that the infant promised, he knew not what: and the Bishop ratified and confir∣med, where there was nothing to be confirmed: he set to his seale, where there was nothing to be sealed. These abuses, were farre vnmeete for the Church of God.</P>
<P>Besides these, ther was great abuse in the manner of doing. For thus the Bishop said, <HI>Con∣signo te signo crucis, &amp; confirmo te chrismate sa∣lutis. I signe thee with the signe of the crosse, and cōfirme thee with the oyle of saluation.</HI> Thus they vsed to doe: these were their words, <HI>with the oyle of saluatiō.</HI> They tooke not this of Christ, nor of his Apostles, nor of the holy auncient fathers. It agreeth not with our Chri∣stian faith, to giue the power of saluation vnto oyle. He that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eketh saluation in oyle, looseth his saluation in Christ, and hath no parte in the kingdome of God. Oyle for the bellie, and for necessarie vses of life. It is no fit instrument without commaundement or promise by the worde, to worke saluation.</P>
<P>More, they said, he was no perfect Christiā, that was not anointed by the Bishop with this holy oile. This was another abuse. For, whoso∣euer
<PB REF="171"/>
is baptized, receiueth thereby the full name of a perfect Christian, and hath the full and perfice couenāt and assurance of saluation: he is perfitely buried with Christ, doth perfitely put on Christ, and is perfitely made partaker of his resurrection. Therefore they are deceiued, that say, no man is a perfite Christian, that is not marked with this oyle. Els the Apostles, and holie Martyrs were but halfe Christians, because the lacked this oyle. Els, what hope and comfort might the pore fathers haue? In what state shall he thinke to finde his childe if he die before confirmation, &amp; passe without perfite Christendome? verely they write thus, <HI>Sine oleo Chrismatis, nemo potest sisti ante tribunal christi. Without y<SUP>e</SUP> oyle of chrisme, no mā can appeare before the Iudgment seat of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, they say, confirmation is more hono∣rable then baptisme: because any priest may bap∣tize, but confirmation is giuen onely by a Bi∣shop, or a suffragain. So doe they giue a grea∣ter preeminence to confirmation, which is diui∣sed by man, then to the holy sacrament of bap∣tisme, which Christ him selfe ordained. I neede not speake more hereof, the errour is so grosse, so thicke, so sensible and palpable.</P>
<P>Againe, when they blessed, or halowed their oyle, they vsed these wordes, <HI>Fiat domine hoc o∣leum, te benedicente; vnctio spiritualis ad purifi∣cationem mētis &amp; corporis, <HI>O Lord, let this oile
<PB REF="171"/>
by thy blessing, be made a spritual ointmēt, to purifie both soule &amp; body.</HI></HI> O Christ Iesu, where was thy crosse, where was thy blood, and the price of thy death and passion, when a drop of oyle was of power to worke remission of all sinnes, to saue and defende against al the dartes of the wicked spirites, and to refresh both bodie and soule? Yet so were we taught, so were wee lead. I faine not these things: The words may be seene. Neither do I speake this, to bring you to a misliking or loathing of our latter fathers: but onely that wee may humble our heartes, and giue thankes to GOD, that hath brought vs out of that darkenes, and giuen vs better knowledge.</P>
<P>Nowe, a worde or two of the bringing vp of children, and preparing them to confirmation. Wherein I woulde God the olde order were duely obserued, that they were instructed per∣fitly to know relygion, &amp; theyr duetie to God: and so might be brought before the Congrega∣tion, and make an open profession of their faith, with promise, that neither tribulation, nor an∣guish, nor persecution, nor famine, nor naked∣nes, nor fire, nor sword, nor life, nor death, shall euer make them denie their faith. Hereof might much be spoken, but I will be short.</P>
<P>The whole standeth in knowledge and in the feare of God: that they may knowe God, &amp; walke before him in reuerence and in feare, and
<PB REF="172"/>
serue him in holines, and righteousnes, al the dayes of their life. The Iewes are a miserable people: they liue in errour, they die in their owne blood: yet haue they so much vnderstan∣ding, that they bringe vp their children in the knowledge of God, and that knowledge they teach out of the worde of God. They remember what charge God gaue them: <HI>Thou shalt teach them thy sonnes, and thy sonnes sonnes.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Therefore, a father must teache his childe what God is: That he is our father, that he hath made vs, and doeth feede vs, and geueth vs all thinges needefull, both for body, and soule: that he is our Lord, and therefore we must serue him, and obey him, and do nothinge whereby he may be displeased: that hee is our iudge, and shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead, and that all men shall come before him, to receiue accor∣ding as they haue done in the flesh. He must put his childe in minde of his baptisine, and teach him that it is a couenent of Gods mercie to vs, and of our duetie to God: that it is a misterie of our saluation: that our soule is so washed with the blood of Christ, as the water of baptisme washeth our bodie. So must he also teach his childe the misterie of the Lordes supper: what and how he receiueth there to his comfort: that as the bread is broken, and the wine poured out, so the bodie of Christ was crucified, and his blood shed for the remission of sinnes: that, if
<PB REF="172"/>
wee beleeue in Christ, wee are through the pro∣mise of GOD, so certainely nourished in our soules to euerlasting life, by the passiō of Christ Iesus our Sauiour, as our bodies are truely nourished w<SUP>t</SUP> the creaturs of bread &amp; wine. Thus <HI>Paul</HI> was brought vp at the feete of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 22.</NOTE> and instructed according to the perfect maner of the law of the fathers. Thus <HI>Timothie</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. 3.</NOTE> brought vp to knowe the holy Scripturs of a childe. How are we become so superstitious? Why haue we bene so delited in darkenes? why is it so harde a matter to remoue vs from the er∣rours wherein wee haue liued? Why had wee rather fal downe before dombe things and wor∣ship them, &amp; continue still in ignorance, rather then harken vnto the worde of God? Why haue we plaied y<SUP>t</SUP> parte of the Iewes, &amp; cried <HI>Crucifige</HI> vpon our deare frendes, and kinsmen: vpon those whome we coulde not iustly accuse of any crime: who offended vs no wayes, but in that they did poynt vs to Christ, and called vs to seek saluation onely in him? Hereof there cannot any better cause be yeelded, then this, that wee were ignorantly bred vp, without knowledge of God, without vnderstanding of his worde The wise man saith, <HI>Teach a childe the trade</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 22.</NOTE> <HI>of his way, and when he is olde hee shal not depart from it.</HI> And againe, <HI>Who so awaketh vnto wisedome betimes, shall haue no great</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wis. 6.</NOTE>
<PB REF="173"/>
<HI>trauel: for he shal find her sittīg at his dores.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore wicked rulers, as <HI>Iulianus, Lici∣nius, Maximinus,</HI> and such others, haue forbiddē that children should be brought vp in the know∣ledge of God. They taught them to blaspheme Christ, and holy men, and to speake yll of them before they knewe them. But let vs looke vpon our children, as vpon the great blessings of god. They are the Lords vessels ordained to honour, let vs keepe thē cleane: they are christs lambes, and sheepe of his flocke, let vs leade them foorth into wholsome pasture. They are the seede plot of heauen, let vs water them, that god may giue the encrease: their angels behold y<SUP>e</SUP> face of God, let vs not offende them: they are the temples, &amp; tabernacles of the holy ghost, let vs not suffer y<SUP>e</SUP> foule spirit to possesse thē, &amp; dwell within them.</P>
<P>God saith, your children, are my childrē. They are the sonnes of God. They are borne a new, &amp; are wel shapen in beautiful proportiō: make thē not mōsters. He is a mōster whosoeuer knoweth not God. By you they are borne into the world, be careful also that by your meanes they may be begotten vnto God, you are careful to traine thē in nourture and comely behauiour of the bodye, seeke also to fashiō their mindes vnto godlines. You haue brought them to the fountaine of bap∣tisme to receiue the marke of Christ, bring them vp in knowledge, &amp; watch ouer them that they be not lost. So shal they be confirmed, and wyll
<PB REF="173"/>
keepe the promise they haue made, &amp; wil growe vnto perfite age in Christ.</P>
<P>Of mariage I shall neede say y<SUP>e</SUP> lesse, the mat∣ter is so knowne, &amp; cōmon. This felowship was first ordeined by God himselfe in paradise. God himself said, <HI>It is not good that man shoulde</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 2.</NOTE> <HI>be himselfe alone: I wil make him an helper meete for him.</HI> God, which fashioned man, and breathed in him the breath of life, &amp; knoweth his very heart &amp; raines, said, it is not good, it is not fit, that man should be hymselfe alone. Although man were in Paradise, although he were in the perfection of vertue, yet saith God he hath neede of a helper. Christ disdayned not to be at a ma∣riage, he honoured it both by his presence, &amp; by y<SUP>e</SUP> working of a miracle. <HI>S. Paul</HI> saith <HI>Mariage, is</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 13.</NOTE> <HI>honorable in al men &amp; the bed vndefiled.</HI> In al men sayth hee, in the Patriarkes, in the Pro∣phets, in the Apostles, in Martyrs, in Byshops.</P>
<P>That al the Apostles <HI>S. Iohn</HI> onely excepted, were maried, appeareth by <HI>Ignatius, Clemens,</HI> &amp; <HI>Eusebius. Spiridiō</HI> was a maried Bishop, &amp; yet he was therby nothing hindred, nether to discharge his dutie, nor to any other godly purpose. <HI>Tertullian</HI> was a Priest, and married as appea∣reth by his owne Booke, written to his wyfe. <HI>Gregorie S. Basils</HI> brother, was Bishop of <HI>Nyssa,</HI> yet married. Another <HI>Gregorie,</HI> was Byshop of <HI>Nazianzū,</HI> yet maried, &amp; neuertheles, a faithful seruāt &amp; steward of y<SUP>e</SUP> mysteries of God. <HI>Hilarie</HI>
<PB REF="174"/>
was Bishop of <HI>Poitiers,</HI> yet married. All these were holy, and Godly, and chaste in bedy, and in spirit, and yet were married. <HI>Gregorie Nazian∣zene</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">In funere Gorgoniae.</NOTE> saith, <HI>Mariage is worthy of praise, for</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>quietnes and contentation that is in it.</HI> And <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> saith, <HI>As well mariage</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strom. li. 3.</NOTE> <HI>as also chastity, haue their peculier offices pertaining to God.</HI> &amp; <HI>Chrysost</HI> saith, <HI>marriage</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hom. 57. ad Heb. Hom. 7. ad Heb.</NOTE> <HI>is voide of fault, and is no hindrance to ver∣tue.</HI> Againe, <HI>So precious a thing is matrimo∣nie, that with the same thou maiest be pro∣moted euen to a Bishops chaire.</HI></P>
<P>What are they then that call mariage vn∣cleanes, filthines, a worke of the flesh? that say it defileth a man, &amp; therefore Gods ministers may not be maried? How can they thus speake that haue any knowledge of y<SUP>t</SUP> which God hath spo∣ken? May we not worthily say vnto such despi∣sers of lawfull matrimonie, y<SUP>t</SUP> which <HI>S. Bernard</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Berm. Ser∣mon. 66. in cantica.</NOTE> in like case said? <HI>Fingunt se amore castitatis ista dicere, cum ea magis causa turpitudinis fouendae, &amp; multiplicandae adinuenerint. They Beare vs in hande that they speake these things for loue of chastitie:</HI> where as in deede they haue deui∣sed the same, to the ende to nourish, &amp; to increse their filthines. Or, as <HI>Augustine</HI> sometime said <NOTE PLACE="marg">August. de moribus Manich. li. 2 cap. 18.</NOTE> to y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Manichees, Non cōcubitum, sed vt ab Apo∣stolo longe antè dictum est, vere nuptias prohibe∣tis. Ye forbid not copulatiō: but as it was lōg ago forespoken by the Apostle, in deede yee
<PB REF="174"/>
forbid verye marriage.</HI> If you marke these fewe wordes which I deliuered, it wyll easely appeare, how reuerent an accompte is to bee made of that state of lyfe. For if you regarde the necessitie thereof, God founde it good to giue man a wyfe: if the antiquitie, it was ordained in the beginning of the worlde: if the place, in Paradise: if the time, in the innocencie of man. If you regarde any thing the rather, because of him that ordeined it, God was the authour of marriage: euen God which made heauen, and earth, and which is the father of our Lorde Ie∣sus Christ. If you seeke the allowance, Christe approued it by his birth in marriage, and by his presence at marriage: if the dignitie, it is ho∣nourable: if among whome, in all men of all estates, of all callinges: in Prince, in subiect, in minister, in Priest, and in people. It is honoura∣ble in Prophetes, honourable in Apostles, in Martirs, in Bishops.</P>
<P>Marriage is honourable in all men, but whoremongers and adulterers God wil iudge: Their portion shalbe with the infidels, they shal bee cast into vtter darknesse, their worme shall neuer die, their fire shall neuer bee quenched, they shall goe downe headlong into the fire that is prepared for the deuill and his angels. <HI>Be not deceiued,</HI> (saith <HI>Saint Paul) neither fornica∣tours,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 6.</NOTE> <HI>nor adulterers, nor wantōs, nor boug∣gerers, shal inherit the kingdome of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="175"/>
Now are wee to speake in the next place of the ministerie of the Church, which some haue called holy orders. Shall wee accompte it a Sacrament? there is no reason so to doe. It is a heauenly office, a holy ministerie or Ser∣uice. By suche as haue this office, God lighte∣neth our darkenesse, hee declareth his minde to vs, hee gathereth together his scattered sheepe, and publisheth vnto the worlde the glad ridings of saluation. The Patriarkes dyd beare this office. This was the office of the prophets. God saith, <HI>I haue sent vnto you al my seruants the prophets, rising vp eueri day, &amp; sending thē.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 7.</NOTE> Agayne he saith, <HI>I haue put my wordes in thy mouth.</HI> Therefore when they taught the peo∣ple <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 51.</NOTE> of God, the Prophetes signed their speache thus. The mouth of the Lorde hath spoken it: The Lorde hath saide: The voyce and y<SUP>e</SUP> worde of the Lord: Heare the word of the Lorde.</P>
<P>But when the fulnesse of the time came, God sent his Sonne, and hath spoken vnto vs by hym. He became our Prophet, to shew vs the wyll of his father. He saieth, <HI>I haue not spo∣ken</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 12.</NOTE> <HI>of my selfe: but the Father whiche sent mee, he gaue mee a commandement, what I should say, and what I should speake.</HI> Here∣of <HI>Saint Iohn</HI> sayth, <HI>No man hath seene God</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 1.</NOTE> <HI>at any time.</HI> He is inuisible, he is incomprehen∣sible, no minde can conceiue hym, no eye can see hym: but, <HI>the onely begotten Sonne,

which is in the bosom of</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Father, hee hath declared him.</HI> Of hym the father sayde, <HI>This</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3.</NOTE> <HI>is my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well pleased: heare hym.</HI> Hearken vnto. hym, re∣ceiue hys woorde, credite hym, beleeue hym. No doubte the Ministerie of the Gospell is hyghlye to bee esteemed, seeinge our Sauiour was not ashamed to publish the wyll of his Fa∣ther in his owne person: yet it appeareth not, where euer hee dyd ordeine it to be a Sacra∣ment.</P>
<P>Hee appointed that the comforte thereof shoulde bee carried into all nations, and gaue that charge vnto hys Apostles, <HI>Goe teache all</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.

Therefore <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 9.</NOTE> he sayeth, <HI>Pray the Lord of the haruest, that he woulde sende labourers into the haruest.</HI> Therefore he ordayneth them to this ministery, <HI>I wyll make you fishers of men.</HI> And sendeth <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 4.

<P>By this ministerie, God hath gathered to hymselfe an acceptable people, and hath brought them to the obedience of the Gospell of Christ, and hath turned the hartes of the Fathers vnto their children, and so made it to be the foundati∣on of religion, They that exercise this ministe∣rie are y<SUP>e</SUP> eyes of Christ, the pillers of y<SUP>e</SUP> Church, the interpreters of Gods will, the watchmen of the Lordes tower, the leaders of Christes sheep, the salte of the earth, the light of the world. <HI>Da∣niel</HI> saith, <HI>They that turne many to righteous¦nes,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 12.</NOTE> <HI>shal shine as the starres for euer &amp; euer.</HI> Not that there is any so great wisdome, or elo∣quence in men: they are but weake, they are vn∣fit to do this seruice. <HI>Esay</HI> saith of himselfe, <HI>I am</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 6. Ierem. 1.</NOTE> <HI>a man of polluted lippes</HI> And <HI>Ieremie</HI> saith, <HI>O Lord god, behold, I cannot speake, for I am a child.</HI> So saith <HI>S. Paul, I haue planted Apol∣los watered, but God gaue the increase. So</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 3.</NOTE> <HI>thē, nether is he that planteth any thing, ne∣ther he that watereth, but God</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>giueth the increase.</HI> So said <HI>Saint Iohn,</HI> that he was not Christe, nor that Prophet, but the voyce of hym that crieth in the wildernesse, and not worthy to vnloose the latchet of his shooe that should come after him.</P>
<P>The power, whereby they dyd conquere the worlde, was not in them, but in the woorde
<PB REF="176"/>
which they preached. <HI>It is the power of God to saluation to euery one that beleueth. It is</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1.</NOTE> <HI>like a fire, &amp; lyke a hammer that breaketh a stone. When ye receiued of vs</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>word of the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iere. 23.</NOTE> <HI>preaching of god,</HI> (saith <HI>S. Paul to the Thes∣salonians) ye receaued it not as the worde of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Thes. 2.</NOTE> <HI>men, but as it is indeede the woorde of god, which also worketh in you that beleue.</HI> The power of an earthly Prince is great. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 20.</NOTE> wyse man sayeth, <HI>The feare of a King, is lyke the roaring of a Lyon.</HI> Yet is a Prince but mortall, and the Law of a Prince is but mor∣tall: it hath no power to force the conscience. But the woorde of God dooth breake into the heart, it forceth a way into the Conscience: it is sharper then any two edged sworde: it en∣treth through, euen to the deuidinge a sunder of the soule and the spirit, because it is the word of God.</P>
<P>For, it is not man, but God that speaketh, as Christ telleth the Apostles, <HI>It is not yee that</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.</NOTE> <HI>speake, but the spirit of your father, whiche speaketh in you.</HI> So saith the Prophet <HI>Zacha∣rie,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luck. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Hee spake by the mouth of his holy Pro∣phets, which haue bene since the worlde be∣ganne.</HI> The Prophets, and Apostles, and ho∣ly men of God were but instruments. It was God which gaue his holy spirite, whiche gaue them tongues to speake, and wordes to vtter. Therfore said <HI>Christ, I wil giue you a mouth,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 21.</NOTE>
<PB REF="177"/>
<HI>and wisedome, where against al your aduer∣saries shall not be able to speake, nor resist.</HI> Though men be but simple, yet the worde they deliuer, is mighty: though they be mortall, the worde of the Lord endureth for euer.</P>
<P>Where this worde is receiued, it is fire, and burneth: it is a hammer, and breaketh the hard∣nesse of the heart: it is mightie in operation: it cleanseth the inner man: it openeth the con∣sctence: it is a sauour of life vnto lyfe: it is the meanes of saluation. Hee that receiueth this worde and beleeueth, shal be saued. This is the worde of reconciliation. God hath committed it vnto vs.</P>
<P>If any hide this worde, he slayeth the people: He is a dombe dogge. Of such God saieth, <HI>Be∣holde, I wil come against the Prophets, that steale my word euerione frō his neighbour.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 23.</NOTE> They are thieues and robbers. <HI>Woe, be vnto you interpreters of the law: for yee haue ta∣ken away the key of knowledge</HI> (saith <HI>Christ)</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 11.</NOTE> <HI>ye entred not in your selues, and them that came in, yee forbad.</HI> And agayne, <HI>Woe bee vnto you Scribes, and Pharises, hypocrites,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 23.</NOTE> <HI>because ye shut vp the kingdome of heauen before men: for ye your selues go not in, ne∣ther suffer ye thē that would enter, to come in.</HI> Of these, and against them God speaketh by the Prophet <HI>Ieremie, Wo be vnto the pastors,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 23.</NOTE>
<PB REF="177"/>
<HI>that destroy, &amp; scatter the sheepe of my pa∣sture.</HI> And by the Prophete <HI>Zacharie, O Idol∣shepherd</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Zach. 11.</NOTE> <HI>that leaueth the flocke.</HI> Thou hast eares, and hearest not: thou hast eyes, and seest not: thou hast a tongue, and speakest not: and a heart, but vnderstandest not: thou art an idole, Christ sayde to thee, feede my lambes, feede my sheepe, but thou carest not for them. Thou hast the roume of an Euangelist, and Pastour, and Teacher: but thou gatherest not the saintes to∣gether: thou doest not the worke of the ministe∣rie: thou buildest not vp the bodie of Christe. They shall perish in their wickednesse, but their blood wyll I require at thy handes.</P>
<P>Here note, this ministerie of the Churche was not ordeined to offer sacrifice for forgiue∣nesse of sinnes. Whosoeuer taketh that office vpon hym, be doeth wrong &amp; iniurie to the death and passion of Christ. He only <HI>is called of god</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 5.</NOTE> <HI>an high Priest after y<SUP>e</SUP> order of Melchisedec.</HI> He onely, <HI>by his owne blood entred in once</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.</NOTE> <HI>into the holy place, &amp; obtained eternall re∣demption for vs.</HI> He only <HI>with one offeringe</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 10.</NOTE> <HI>hath consecrated for euer them y<SUP>t</SUP> are san∣ctified.</HI> He only hath said, <HI>Consummatum est. It is finished.</HI> The ransome or price for mans saluation, and for forgiuenesse of the sinnes of the worlde is payde in mee, in my death vpon the Crosse. Of hym alone, and onely of hym,
<PB REF="178"/>
hath it bene spoken, <HI>This is my well beloued</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Sonne in whom I am well pleased.</HI> And by <HI>Esay, With his stripes only, we are healed.</HI> It <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 53.</NOTE> is he only <HI>which hath made of both, one.</HI> It is he only, <HI>which did put out y<SUP>•</SUP> hande writing</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 2. Colos. 2.</NOTE> <HI>of ordināces y<SUP>•</SUP> was against vs: he euen tooke it out of the way, and fastened it vppon the Crosse.</HI> He alone, is our hye Priest, the Lambe of God, the Sacrifice for sinnes, the Altar, the Propitiation for sinners, and redeemer of the world, He only hath appeased the wrath of god. He onely appeareth in the sight of GOD, to make intercession for our sinnes. All others whatsoeuer, Apostles, Prophetes, Teachers, and Pastours, are not in office to offer any propitiatorie sacrifice: but are called to the mi∣nisterie of the Saintes, to the edification of the bodye of Christe, and to the repayringe of the Church of God.</P>
<P>Thus muche of the holy ministerie of the Church, which standeth in the setting foorth of the mysterie of our saluation, both by the Preachinge of the woorde of GOD, and by the due and reuerent ministration of the Sa∣cramentes. The principallest parte of this of∣fice, is to preache repentance, that so wee may amende our lyues, and bee conuerted vnto GOD. So <HI>Ioel</HI> the Prophet followed hys ministerie, sayinge, <HI>Rent your heartes and not your garmentes, and turne to the Lorde</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioel. 2.</NOTE>
<PB REF="178"/>
<HI>your God, for he is gracious &amp; merciful.</HI> So <HI>S. Paul</HI> teacheth, <HI>that true circumcision is by</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colos. 2.</NOTE> <HI>putting off the sinnefull body of the fleesh:</HI> that it is in mortifying our members that bee on the earth, <HI>Fornication, vncleanesse, the inordinate affections, euil concupiscence, &amp;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3.</NOTE> <HI>couetousnes, which is idolatrie:</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> it is in put∣ting away al these thinges, <HI>wrath, anger, mali∣ciousnes, cursed speakinge, filthy speakinge out of your mouth in putting of the old mā with his works,</HI> and putting on the new, which is renewed in knowledge after y<SUP>e</SUP> image of him that created him.</P>
<P>So <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> said, <HI>Repent, for the king∣dome</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3.</NOTE> <HI>of God is at hand. Prepare ye y<SUP>•</SUP> waies of the Lord, &amp; make his pathes straight.</HI> So our Sauiour Christ, when he began to preache, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 4.</NOTE> said, <HI>Am end your liues, for the kingdome of God is at hand.</HI></P>
<P>Therfore it wil not bee amisse now, to speake of repentaunce, which some of late yeares haue chaunged into pennaunce, and there of haue also made a Sacrament. Here it behoueth to rippe vp the whole lyfe of man. There is not any man that liueth, and sinneth not. God sayeth, <HI>The imagination of mans heart is euyll</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9.</NOTE> <HI>from his youth.</HI> The Prophet <HI>Ieremie</HI> saith, <HI>The heart is deceitful and wicked aboue all</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierem. 17.</NOTE> <HI>things who can know it?

<P>God is a righteous God, and the auenger of all them that offende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>Saint Paul</HI> saith, <HI>The</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 6.</NOTE> <HI>wages of sinne is death.</HI> And the Prophet <HI>E∣zechiel, The soule that sinneth shall dye.</HI> For this cause then God ordayned the ministerie of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 18.</NOTE> his worde, and appoynted certayne to this office, that they shoulde warne his people of theyr sinnes, and feare them by the terrour of Gods assured displeasure, and heauy wrath. As is seene by y<SUP>t</SUP> to <HI>Esay, Cry aloude, spare not: lift vp thy voyce lyke a trumpet, and shewe my</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 58.</NOTE> <HI>people their transgressions, &amp; the house of Iacob their sins.</HI> So <HI>Saint Paul</HI> vnto <HI>Timo∣thie, I charge thee before God, &amp; the Lorde</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

long suffering and doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>So woulde God haue our filth layde open before our eyes, that wee might weigh and iudge our owne heartes, that euery man might make charge vppon him selfe, and saye, I am an vnprofitable seruant, my righteousnesse is as a foule and steined cloth. My soule hath sin∣ned, and hath deserued to dye the death.</P>
<P>In this case, some fall into desperation, and saye, as sometimes dyd <HI>Caine, My sinne is</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 4.</NOTE> <HI>greater, then can be pardoned.</HI> God with∣draweth his mercie from mee, I am vnwor∣thie of it. I haue offended against the holy spi∣rit of GOD: mine owne conscience accuseth me. I haue no parte in the kingdome of GOD, and of Christe: there is no sacrifice left for my sinnes. Thus the wicked liue in trembling and agony, as dyd <HI>Cain:</HI> thus they leaue their lyfe with horrour and miserie: so haue they no grace to repent, no taste nor feelyng of the mer∣cie of God.</P>
<P>But, the children of God, though they bee wounded, yet they finde reliefe in the certayne hope of Gods mercie. Though they say, I am a sinner, my sinnes are more in number then the heares of my head: I haue offended against hea∣uen and earth. Yet they know that Christ came to call sinuers to repentance, &amp; that hee healeth those that are sicke. That he sayde, <HI>Come vnto</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 11.</NOTE> <HI>mee all yee that are wearye and laden, and
<PB REF="180"/>
I wil ease you.</HI> For, what layeth he on his shoul∣ders with ioy? Is it not the lost sheepe? Where∣fore doeth the woman light a candle, and sweepe the house, and seeke diligently, tyll she finde it? Is it not for the peace of siluer, which shee had lost? Ouer whome had the father compassion, and ranne, and fell on his necke, and kissed him? Was not this done for hym which was dead, but liued agayne, and for hym whiche was lost, but was found againe? <HI>The sonne of man came to saue that which was lost.</HI> And, <HI>There is ioy in</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 18.

<P>God is merciful, and his mercie endureth for euer. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayeth the Prophet <HI>Dauid. Mercie is with the Lord.</HI> By the Prophet <HI>Ezechiel, I de∣sire</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 130. Ezech. 18.</NOTE> <HI>not the death of him that dieth,</HI> saith the Lord God. It is the wyll of God, <HI>that all men shal be saued, &amp; come to the knowledge of</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

For I, euen I am he that put∣teth away thine iniquities, for mine owne</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 43.</NOTE> <HI>sake, and wil not remember thy sinnes.</HI> The children of God heare this, and are glad. They lift themselues vp in the fayth of the mercye of God: they see the filthynesse of their sinne: they knowe though the wrath of God be kinde∣led against sinne, yet he doth not vtterly destroy those that haue sinned, but such as continue in
<PB REF="180"/>
their sinnes without repentance: they know god will not dispise an humble and contrite heart.</P>
<P>Therefore they say, <HI>Enter not into iudge∣mēt</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 143.</NOTE> <HI>with thy seruant, O Lord, for no flesh is righteous in thy sight.</HI> Take away the iniqui∣tie of thy seruant. They say, Why art thou hea∣uie, O my soule, and why art thou vnquiet within mee? Wayte on God: for I wyll yet giue him thankes for the helpe of his presence. They saye, there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus. Though I shoulde walke through the valleye of the shadowe of death, I wyll feare no euill, because thou art with mee. They say, <HI>If our heart condemne vs, God is greater then our hearte.</HI> Thus <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Iohn. 3.</NOTE> are wee taughte by the office of the ministe∣rie, and by the worde of God, to see our selues, to know our weakenes, to repent our sinnes, to beleeue the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and to turne vnto God.</P>
<P>We are taught to lay open and acknowledge our sinnes, not to hide them, but to make con∣fession of them. This is done two wayes: either in the secrete thought of thy heart before God, or els in the hearing and presence of men. <HI>Da∣uid</HI> made confession of his sinnes before God. <HI>I acknowledged my sin before thee, neither hid I mine iniquitie. I saide I will confesse a∣gainst</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32.</NOTE> <HI>my self my wickednes vnto the Lord, &amp; thou forgauest y<SUP>e</SUP> punishment of my sinne.</HI>
<PB REF="181"/>
And againe, <HI>I know mine iniquities, and my</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 15.</NOTE> <HI>sin is euer before mee. Against thee, against thee only haue I sinned, &amp; done euill in thy sight.</HI> Such a confessiō made <HI>Daeniel. We haue</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 9.</NOTE> <HI>sinned, &amp; haue cōmitted iniquitie, &amp; haue done wickedly: yea, we haue rebelled, and haue departed from thy precepts, and from thy iudgements. For we would not obey thi seruants the Prophetes, which spake in thy name to our kings, to our princes, &amp; to our fathers, &amp; to al the people of the land.</HI> Euen so the prophet <HI>Esay, Beholde thou art angrie,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 64.</NOTE> <HI>for we haue sinned. We haue all bene as an vncleane thing, &amp; all our righteousnes as is filthy cloutes, &amp; we al do fade like a leafe, &amp; our iniquities like</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>winde haue taken vs a∣way. But now, O Lord, thou art our father: We are the clay, &amp; thou art our potter, and wee al are the worke of thy handes.</HI> This is true and Christian confession. We are requi∣red after this sorte to examine our selues, and confesse our sinnes before God: who dooth not so, hee shall not finde mercy and forgiuenesse of his sinnes.</P>
<P>The other sort of confession made vnto men, I doe not condemne. It may doe much good, if it be wel vsed. <HI>S. Iames</HI> commendeth it amonge the faithfull, <HI>Acknowledge your faults one to</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iocob. 5.</NOTE> <HI>another, &amp; pray one for another,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>yee may bee healed.</HI> Hee speaketh not of Priest or mi∣nister,
<PB REF="181"/>
but of euery one of the faithfull. Euery Christian may doe this helpe vnto another, to take knowledge of the secret and inner griefe of the heart: to looke vppon the wounde, whiche sinne and wickednes hath made, and by godlye aduise and earnest prayer for hym, to receuer his brother. This is a priuate exhortation, and as it were a Catechizing, or instructing in the faith, and a meanes to leade vs by familiar and speciall conference, to examine our conscience, and to espie wherein wee haue offended God. The vse and practise hereof is not onely to bee allowed, but most needefull and requisite, if so the superstition, and necessitie, and conscience, which many haue fondely vsed and put therein, be taken away.</P>
<P>That the Priestes shoulde heare the priuate confessions of the people, and listen to their whisperings: that euery man shoulde be bound to their auriculer confession, it is no commande∣ment or ordinance of God. It is deuised and establyshed by men, and was lately confirmed by <HI>Innocentius</HI> the thirde. The Church of God in the time of our elder fathers, was not tyed to any such necessitie.</P>

Make thy confession, not with the tongue, but in the record of thyne owne conscience.</P>
<P>Likewise <HI>S. Augustine: Quid mihi est cum hominibus, vt audiant confessiones meas, quasi ipsi sanaturi sint omnes languores meos?

<P>By these testimonies of <HI>Chrysost. August.

<P>Nowe in a worde or two, I wyll somewhat speake of sacisfaction or recompēce for offences which we haue done, wherby we satisfie &amp; make amendes to the full conten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation of him that is offended.

<P>This is of two sortes, either that which is done vnto God, or that which is done vnto men. We are neuer able to satisfie, &amp; make amendes vnto God.

<P>The thief vpō y<SUP>•</SUP> crosse, called vpō Iesus, <HI>Lord remēber me whē thou cōmest into thy king∣dome.</HI> He knew he had offended God, but foūd not how he might make amends, otherwise thē by the righteous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of Christ. Iesus answered him, <HI>verely I say vnto thee, to day thou shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be with me in paradise.</HI> Today, that is, by and by. Hee refuseth hym not, nor feareth hym
<PB REF="183"/>
that God wyll refufe him, because he had done amisse, and made no recompence: but promiseth hym, because he repented, and beleeued, that hee shal be saued. <HI>Paul</HI> was throwne downe a perse∣quutor, and raysed vp a preacher. What amends might he make in so short time?</P>
<P><HI>Saint Ciprian</HI> saith, <HI>Sanguis tuus, O Christe,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cipria. de passione do∣mini.</NOTE> <HI>non quaerit vindictam. Thy blood O Christ loo¦keth not for any reuenge.</HI> And saint <HI>Ambrose Lachrimas Petri lego, satisfactionem non lego.</HI> I reade of Peters teares, but I reade nothynge <NOTE PLACE="marg">De paenit. Pe. Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Ser. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> of any satisfaction he made. For our whole life cannot sufficyently acquite vs from the gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣nesse of one sinne: much lesse is any man able to worke or deserue y<SUP>•</SUP> forgiuenes of all his sinnes. The only things that God requireth of vs whē we haue sinned, ar that we sorow for our sinnes, and amende our liues. So <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist spake to the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arisies, <HI>Bringe foorth fruite</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 3. Ephe. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</NOTE> <HI>worthy amendement of life.</HI> So saint <HI>Paul</HI> calleth the <HI>Ephesians</HI> to make recompence for their former naughtines: <HI>Cast of lyinge, and speake euery man the trueth vnto his neigh¦bour. Let him</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>stole steale no more, but le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him rather labour, &amp; worke with his hands the thing that is good.</HI> Other recompēce, god looketh not for at our handes.</P>
<P>But, when the godly haue taken offence at any our doings that are euil, wee must giue all
<PB REF="184"/>
heede to content their mindes, &amp; reconcile our selues againe vnto them. It hath bene an anciēt order in the Church of God, that, if any had o∣penly offended the congregatiō, he should come openly againe before them to satisfie them by amends. There he fel downe on his knees, con∣fessed his fault, wepte, and lamēted for it: prayed the brethren that they woulde forgiue him, and would also praye vnto God to be mercifull vnto him. There the whole congregation fell downe before God: their heartes moulted: their eyes gushed out in teares: they helde vp their hands: prayed together for him, and gaue thankes to God, that their brother which had bene lost, was founde againe. Such satisfaction was it, which hath bene made to the Church of God.</P>
<P>The last of those which some haue of late misused, and counted one of the sacramentes of the Church, is <HI>Extreme vnction.</HI> And this they haue founded vpon the words of <HI>S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ames, Is ani</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cob. 5.</NOTE> <HI>sicke among you? let him call for</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>elders of the Churche, &amp; let them praye for him, and anoint him with oile in</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>name of the Lord, and the prayer of faith shal saue the sicke, &amp; the Lord shal raise him vp: and if he haue cō∣mitted sinne, it shal be forgiuen him.</HI></P>
<P>For the better vnderstanding of which words, consider that God is mercifull to the sonnes of men, and sheweth foorth his mercie at sundrie times by sundrie wayes. And to leaue the exam∣ples
<PB REF="184"/>
of the olde Testament: in the time of the gospel, he hath giuen to some y<SUP>•</SUP> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft of tongues, and hath made them able beinge simple men, to speake the wonderful works of God in tongues which they neuer learned. To som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he hath giuē the gift of power, and of the operation of great workes. By this power, many signes and won∣ders were wrought by y<SUP>•</SUP> hands of the Apostles. At the word of <HI>Peter, Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> hys <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 5. Act. 13.</NOTE> wyfe, fel downe dead. In this power <HI>Paul</HI> stroke <HI>Elimas</HI> the sorcerer with blindnes.</P>
<P>To some he gaue the gift of healing. By this <HI>S. Peter</HI> healed a man which was a creeple from <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 3.</NOTE> his mothers wombe, and said, <HI>In the name of Iesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth, <HI>rise vp and walke: &amp; hee tooke him by the right hande, &amp; lift him vp, and immediatly his feete and ancle bones receiued strength.</HI></HI></HI> They were able to make the blinde, see: the lame, to walke: the leapers, to be cleane: the dead to receaue life a∣gayne. For when he sent foorth his Apostles to preach. <HI>Christ gaue them power against vn∣cleane</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.</NOTE> <HI>spirits, to cast them out, and to heale euery sicknes, and euery disease.</HI></P>
<P>These things they wrought, sometimes by their shadowe, as many were healed by the sha∣dowe of <HI>Peter:</HI> sometimes with their worde: sometimes with handekerchifes: sometimes by laying on of handes, and by touchinge: some∣times with oyle, as is in the sixth of <HI>S. Marke,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Marke. 6.</NOTE>
<PB REF="185"/>
<HI>they cast out many deuils, &amp; they anointed many</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>were sicke with oyle, &amp; healed thē:</HI> euen as Christ also by many sundrie wayes hea∣led many. He healed sometimes, though he were absent: sometimes by his worde: sometimes by mourning and sorowinge: sometimes by hys garment: sometimes by touching: sometimes with specle, &amp; dust: for at that time the Church had the especial gift of working miracles.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>S. Iames</HI> putteth them in mynde, that they dispise not to vse the meanes whiche God hath appoynted: that whosoeuer falleth in∣to sickenes, he call for the Elders, and that they vse their gift of healinge, and anointe him with oyle, because it hath pleased GOD thereby to worke health. This was the maner and order of those times. Euen as christ vsed dust and spetle: so <HI>S. Iames</HI> willeth them to vse oyle for the resto∣ring of health. As the <HI>Corinthians</HI> dyd abuse the gift of tongues, &amp; were taught by <HI>S. Paul</HI> how to vse it better: so dyd many abuse y<SUP>•</SUP> gift of hea∣ling, &amp; were therfore warned by <HI>S. Iames</HI> howe they should vse it better. As the gift of tongues was not to last for euer, but only for a time: so y<SUP>•</SUP> gift of healing was not to continue euer, but for a time. Christ saith, <HI>When thou fastest, anoint</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6.</NOTE> <HI>thine head, &amp; wash thy face.</HI> Hee dooth not in these words giue an vniuersal commandement, that must euer be kept in our fasting, that wee vse the ceremonie of anointing: but, meaneth
<PB REF="185"/>
thereby, that in our faste we bee fresh and mery. Euen so <HI>S. Iames,</HI> in saying, <HI>anoint him with oyle,</HI> doth not set downe an order, wherunto hee would haue the Church of God tyed for euer: it is not an vniuersal commandement, that the af∣ter ages should do the like: but onely a particu∣lar ordinance for the time, to vse the gift of hea∣ling. This is the meaning of his words.</P>
<P>Let vs marke what abuses haue growne by mistaking them. <HI>S. Iames</HI> speaketh of bare and simple oyle: They vnderstande it of their oyle, which they consecrate, and halow in vnaduised order. For these wordes the Bishop vseth when hee consecrateth it. <HI>Aue sanctū oleum, chrisma, balsamum. Haile O holy oyle, &amp; chrisme, and balsame.</HI> Againe, <HI>exerciso te immūde spiritus, in nomine patris, &amp; filii, &amp; spiritus sancti, vt recedas ab hoc oleo, vt possit effici vnctio spiritualis, vt spi∣ritus sanctus possit in eo habitare. I adiure thee thou vncleane spirit, in</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy ghost, that thou depart from this oile,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>it may be a spi∣ritual ointment, and</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>the holy ghoste may dwell in it.</HI> Agayne, <HI>Emitte quaesumus, sancte pater, spiritum sanctum paracletum tuum de coe∣lis in hanc pinguedinem oliuae, ad refectionē cor∣porum, &amp; sanationem animarum, O holy father we beseeche thee send downe thy holy spirit</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>comforter frō heauen into this fatnesse of</HI> y<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>oliue, to the refreshing of body &amp; soule.</HI>
<PB REF="186"/>
In like sort they are taught to pray ouer y<SUP>•</SUP> sicke <HI>Per hanc sactam vnctionem, &amp; suam piissimam misericond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m ignoscat tibi deus, vt per hanc vn∣ctionē habeas remissionem omniū peccatorum: By this holy anointing, &amp; by his great mercye God pardon thee, that by this anointinge, thou maiest haue remission of al thy sinnes.</HI></P>
<P>I deuise not these thinges, I imagine them not of my selfe, nor reporte them vntrulye. The Byshop in such wordes blesseth the oyle: &amp; with such wordes doeth the Priest anoynt the sicke with oyle: In their Bookes it is easie to bee seene. Now iudge you, if this were <HI>S Iames</HI> doctrine, or if this order were kept in the church in the time of the Apostles. Would you thinke that <HI>S. Iames</HI> gaue curtesie by bowing his bo∣die, and saying <HI>Aue to the oyle:</HI> dyd he speake wordes of coniuration to driue foorth the euyll spirite: woulde he euer say that the Oyle doth heale both bodye and soule: or that remission of al sinnes is giuē by annointing: <HI>S. Iames</HI> knew that remissiō of sinnes is not giuen by any crea∣ture: that there is no name in heauen or earth, by which wee are saued, but the name of Iesus onely: that the holy ghost resteth not, nor dwel∣leth in oyle, but in the hearts of the faithful: that God giueth health, not in respect of the corrup∣tible creature, but at the praiers of the Church, which are offered vp to hym by his sonne, our sauiour. So great difference is there betweene
<PB REF="186"/>
the late meaning, and the meaning of <HI>S. Iames.</HI></P>
<P>Such vse of y<SUP>•</SUP> oyle we haue not, neither doth the Church of God allow it. Yet holde we the rule of the Apostle in visitation of the sicke: When any is sicke among vs, the Minister cō∣meth vnto him, and discretlye instructeth hym in what sorte he should prepare hymselfe to de∣part this life, &amp; so leadeth hym to comforte, and laboureth to make hym stronge in the certayne hope of euerlasting lyfe.</P>
<P>Thus he saith: Brother, you are entringe the way of al flesh. Al y<SUP>•</SUP> sonnes of <HI>Adam</HI> are heires of this sentence of God vpon <HI>Adam,</HI> thou arte duste, and to dust thou shalt returne. Man that is borne of woman, is of short continuance, and ful of trouble. He shooteth foorth as a floure, &amp; is cut downe: hee vanisheth also as a shadowe, and continueth not. Humble thy selfe vnder the mightie hand of God. Hee is our good father, &amp; dooth correct those children whome hee loueth. Blessed is he, whom the Lord doth chastise, and instruct in his wayes.</P>
<P>Here is the proofe &amp; trial of your patience, &amp; faith: remember the patience of <HI>Iob,</HI> in al his mi∣series he praised y<SUP>•</SUP> name of the Lord. Although (saith hee) he shoulde kill me, yet wyl I put my trust in God. Although my bowels be consu∣med within mee, and my members of my body bee rent a sunder, and the pangues bee neuer so great, yet can I not but trust in him. Loue not <NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Iohn. 2.</NOTE>
<PB REF="187"/>
the world, nor y<SUP>t</SUP> things that be in the world. The world passeth away, &amp; the lust therof. The wise man saith. <HI>I haue cōsidered al the works that are done vnder the sun, &amp; behold, al is vani∣tie</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 1.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; vexatiō of spirit.</HI> Againe, <HI>great trauel is created for al men, &amp; an heauy yoke vpō the sonnes of Adam, frō the day</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>thei go out of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 40.</NOTE> <HI>their mothers wombe, til the day</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>they re∣turn to</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>mother of al things.</HI> Christ hath ther¦fore wille<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vs to wake, &amp; bee ready, because wee know not in what houre our master will come. He saith, <HI>Behold, I come as a thief: blessed is he which watcheth &amp; kepeth his garments,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 16.</NOTE> <HI>least he walk naked, &amp; men see his filthines.</HI></P>
<P>Examine your selfe, consider howe, and in what thinges you haue offended God, make a true and humble confession of your sinnes: say with <HI>Dauid, I haue sinned against the Lorde, and I will confesse against my selfe my wic∣kednes vnto</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Lord.</HI> Call to minde how you haue gotten your goods, how you haue vsed thē, &amp; whether you haue delighted in thē, or put any confidence in thē. Call to minde how you haue taken care for your Children &amp; seruantes, if by your good meanes, they haue bene nourtered in the feare of y<SUP>t</SUP> Lord. In these, &amp; such other parts of your lyfe, lay open your sinnes, let them come forth before you, acknowledge thē against your¦selfe vnto the Lord, say boldly, because you may saye it truelye, I am an vnprofitable seruant, I
<PB REF="187"/>
haue not done that which I ought to haue done: there is no good thinge dwellinge in mee: the Law in my members hath preuailed agaynste the Lawe of my minde. It can not bee, but God wyl cast his eyes vpon you, and wyl heare you, and wil pardon the wickednes of your sinnes.</P>
<P>What wanteth in you to the fulnesse of righ∣teousnesse, is already satisfied in the rigeteous∣nes of Christ. God hath saide, and sworne, <HI>As I</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 33.</NOTE> <HI>liue saith the Lord God, I desire not</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>death of the wicked, but</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>the wicked turne from his way, &amp; liue.</HI> And againe, <HI>if the wicked will</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 18.</NOTE> <HI>returne from all his sinnes</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>he hath cōmit∣ted: al his transgressions</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>he hath commit∣ted, thei shal not be mētioned vnto him.</HI> The Lord is ful of compassion &amp; mercy. For as high as the heauen is aboue the earth, so great is his mercie towared them that feare hym. As far as the East is frō the West, so farre hath he remo∣ued our sinnes frō vs. Christ himselfe saith, <HI>God</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 3.</NOTE> <HI>so loued the world,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>he hath giuen his only begotten sonne, that whosoeuer beleueth in him, should not perish, but haue life euerla∣sting.</HI> And <HI>S. Paul, <HI>god setteth out his loue to¦ward vs, seeing y<SUP>t</SUP> while we were yet sinners,</HI></HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Christ died for vs, much more thē being iu∣stified by his blod, we shalbe saued frō wrath through him.</HI> Thus in time of sicknes are we put in minde to examine and view our sins, &amp; to solace our selues in y<SUP>t</SUP> bloodshedding of Christ.</P>
<P><PB REF="188"/>
Farther, he that is sicke, is counsailed to call to minde, what any man hath trespassed him, &amp; to forgiue them: because God is y<SUP>e</SUP> God of loue: and if any man hate his brother, hee abideth in death: and we are commanded to saye, forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgiue them that tres∣passe against vs: &amp; if we doe forgiue men theyr trespasses, our heauenly father will also forgiue vs. But if we do not forgiue men theyr trespas∣ses, no more wil our heauenly father forgiue vs our trespasses, That so, all we which are redee∣med with one price, by the precious blood of the vnspotted lambe, may ioyne together as parta∣kers of one inheritance, and the children of one father, and so goe forewarde to one glorie by one way, and become al one in Iesus Christ our Lorde.</P>
<P>In this case, the good father calleth his sonne vnto him, and exhorteth him in this manner. My sonne harken vnto mee: these be the last words, which I shal speake vnto thee. Thou seest in me the weakenes and decay of flesh: thou shalt be, as I am now One passeth before another, the worlde and the beauty thereof fade away, and come to an ende. Trust not the worlde, it wil de∣ceiue thee: walke aduisedly: knowe y<SUP>t</SUP> thou shalt giue an accompt of thy doings. <HI>For we must al appeare before</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>iudgement seate of christ.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 5.</NOTE> y<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>euery man may receaue the things which are done in his body, according to that hee
<PB REF="188"/>
hath done, whether it be good or euil.</HI></P>
<P>Deceiue no man by wrongful dealing: en∣crease not thy goodes by extortion, nor by vsury: he that giueth his money vnto vsurie, shall not enter into the tabernacle of the Lorde. Hee that taketh vsury of his neighbour, killeth him with∣out a sword. The Lord wyll auenge it: he wil not blesse yl gotten goods: they cannot prosper: they wyll neuer continue, nor remayne vnto the third heire.</P>
<P>My sonne, in all thy doings feare the Lord. If thou feare the Lord, thou shalt prosper, &amp; in the day of thine ende, thou shalt bee blessed. Medle not much with other mens busines, least thou be entangled with controuersies: abhorre the flan∣derer &amp; double tongued. Let my doings which am thy father, be euer before thyne eyes. Those few goodes which I haue, were truly gotten. I haue not gathered them of the teares, and heaui∣nes, and vndoing, or hindering of any. Be faith∣full to thy wife, and besides her know none o∣ther. Helpe thy neighbour accordinge to thy power: and turne not thy face from the poore &amp; needie. Be mercifull after thy power. If thou hast much, giue plentiously: if thou hast licle, do thy diligence gladly to giue of that litle. Be not slowe to visit the sick: whatsoeuer thou takest in hande, remember the ende, and thou shalt ne∣uer do amisse.</P>
<P>As for me, I haue passed the vanities and mi∣series
<PB REF="189"/>
of this world. The Lorde hath giuen, and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord. He is the Lorde my God, let hym doe with me, as it seemeth good vnto hym. I knowe that this shall hasten my saluatien: And that Christ shalbe magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. I haue not so liued, that I am ashamed to liue: neither am I afrayde to die, for we haue a gracious Lord. I know, that if my earthly house of this tabernacle bee destroyed. I haue a building giuē of God, that is, an house not made with handes, but eternal in y<SUP>•</SUP> heauens. They that die in the Lord are blessed, they shall rest from their labors. Christ is vnto me both in lyfe, and in death, aduantage. In such sort do the Godly prepare themselues to their iourney out of this life.</P>
<P>Then the Minister prayeth, that he e may bee constant in this faith: he strengtheneth him, &amp; confirmeth him in it. He exhorteth the sicke to commende him selfe vnto God: he prayeth vnto God, that he will giue his Angels charge ouer him to keepe him and defende hym, that hee fall not into temptation. He teacheth him to saye, O lord, in thee haue I trusted, let mee neuer be con∣founded. Come Lord Iesus, come, and take mee vnto thee: Lord, let thy seruant depart in peace: thy kindome come. I am thy sonne, thine am I, O saue me: into thine hands, O Lord, I com∣mende my spirite, thou hast redeemed mee, O
<PB REF="189"/>
Lorde God of trueth. In this state he dyeth, and hath his eyes alwayes fastened vpon God, and so seeth, how indeede, the dead are blessed which dye in the Lord.</P>
<P>Thus doth the Churche of God instruct all men to liue, and to die, and to bee in readinesse. Thus ar the sicke amonge vs annointed with the inner &amp; in uisible oyle of y<SUP>•</SUP> mercie of God. Thus are they put in minde to haue the oyle of faith, and of a good conscience, and that their lampes may euer be burning, that so they may enter in with the bridegrome: that the day spring from an high may visit their hearts: &amp; that it may be said vnto them, come ye blessed of my father, inherit ye the king∣dome prepared for you from the foundatiōs of the worlde.</P>
