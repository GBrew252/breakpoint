</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Text is produced by our
Saviour out of <HI>Moses</HI> his Law
in answer to a question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6. 9. 10. 12.</NOTE> where∣with
a learned Pharisee thought to pose,
or puzzle him;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> the question was, which
<HI>was the great,</HI> and <HI>first commandment in
the Law;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> a question which, it seems,
had been examined, and determined
among the Doctours, in the Schools of
those days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 10. 27.</NOTE> (for, in Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> to the
like question intimated by our Saviour,
another Lawyer readily yields the same
answer, and is therefore commended by
our Saviour, with a <HI>rectè respondisti,
thou hast answered rightly)</HI> so that had
our Saviour answered otherwise, he had,
we may suppose, been taxed of ignorance
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
and unskilfulness, perhaps also of errour
and heterodoxie; to convict him of
which seems to have been the design of
this <HI>Jewish</HI> trier or tempter (for he is
said to ask <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>trying,</HI> or
tempting <HI>him.)</HI> But our Saviour defeats
his captious intent, by answering, not
onely according to truth and the reason
of the thing, but agreeably to the doc∣trine
then current, and as the Lawyer
himself out of his memory and learning
would have resolved it: and no wonder
since common sense dictates, that the
Law enjoyning sincere and entire love
toward God is necessarily the first, and
chief, or the most fundamental Law of
all Religion; for that whosoever doth
believe the being of God (according to
the most common notion that Name
bears) must needs discern himself obli∣ged
first and chiefly to perform those
acts of mind and will toward him,
which most true and earnest love do
imply: different expressions of love may
be prescribed, peculiar grounds of love
may be declared in several ways of Re∣ligion;
but in the general and main
substance of the duty all will conspire,
all will acknowledge readily, that it is
love we chiefly owe to God; the duty
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
which he may most justly require of us,
and which will be most acceptable to
him. It was then indeed the great com∣mandment
of the old (or rather of the
young and less perfect) Religion of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> and it is no less of the more adult
and improved Religion which the Son of
God did institute and teach; the diffe∣rence
onely is, that Christianity declares
more fully how we should exercise it;
and more highly engages us to observe
it; requires more proper and more sub∣stantial
expressions thereof; extends our
obligation as to the matter, and intends
it, as to the degree thereof: for as it re∣presents
Almighty God in his nature
and in his doings more lovely than any
other way of Religion (either natural,
or instituted) hath done, or could doe,
so it proportionably raises our obligation
to love him: it is, as S. <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1. 3▪</NOTE> <HI>the</HI> last <HI>drift,</HI>
or the supreme pitch <HI>of the</HI> Evangelical
<HI>profession,</HI> and institution to Love; to
love God first, and then our neighbour
<HI>out of a pure heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coloss. 3. 14.</NOTE> <HI>and good conscience,
and faith unfeigned:</HI> it is <HI>the bond,</HI> or
knot <HI>of</HI> that <HI>perfection</HI> which the Gospel
injoins us to aspire to:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 48.</NOTE> 'tis the first and
principall of those goodly <HI>fruits,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Galat. 5. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> which
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<HI>the Holy Spirit</HI> of Christ produceth in
good Christians. It is therefore plainly
with us also the great Commandment
and chief Duty: chiefly great in its ex∣tent,
in its worth, in its efficacy and
influence: most great it is, in that it
doth (eminently at least, or virtually)
contain all other Laws and Duties of
Piety; they being all as Branches ma∣king
up its Body, or growing out of it
as their Root.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 9, 10.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Paul</HI> saith of the
love toward our neighbour, that it is
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>a full performance of
the laws</HI> concerning him; and that <HI>all
commandments</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>are reca∣pitulated,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 14.</NOTE>
or summ'd up <HI>in this one say∣ing,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy
self:</HI> and by like, or greater reason are
all the Duties of Piety comprised in the
Love of God; which is the chief of
those two hinges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vers. 40.</NOTE> <HI>upon which</HI> (as our
Saviour here subjoins) <HI>the whole law
and the prophets do hang.</HI> So great is
this Duty in extent: and it is no less in
proper worth; both as it immediately
respects the most excellent, and most
necessary performances of Duty (em∣ploying
our highest faculties in their best
operations) and as it imparts vertue and
value to all other acts of Duty: for no
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Sacrifice is acceptable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. 2. 13. 9. 24. 20. 1.</NOTE> which is not kin∣dled
by this heavenly Fire; no Offering
sweet and pure, which is not seasoned
by this holy Salt; no Action is truly
good or commendable, which is not
conjoined with, or doth not proceed from
the Love of God; that is not performed
with a design to please God, or (at least)
with an opinion that we shall do so
thereby. If a man perform any good
work not out of love to God, but from
any other principle, or for any other
design (to please himself or others, to
get honour or gain thereby) how can it
be acceptable to God; to whom it hath
not any due regard? And what action
hath <HI>it</HI> for its principle, or its ingredient,
becomes sanctified thereby, in great
measure pleasing and acceptable to God;
such is the worth and value thereof. It
is also the great Commandment for ef∣ficacy
and influence, being naturally
productive of Obedience to all other
Commandments; especially of the most
genuine and sincere Obedience; no
other principle being in force and acti∣vity
comparable thereto: (fear may
drive to a complyance with some, and
hope may draw to an observance of
others, but it is Love, that with a kind of
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
willing constraint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 14.</NOTE> and kindly violence
carries on cheerfully, vigorously and
swiftly to the performance of all God's
Commandments:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 2. 5.</NOTE> <HI>If any man loves me,</HI>
saith our Saviour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 14. 23.</NOTE> <HI>he will keep my word;</HI>
to keep his word is a natural and ne∣cessary
result of love to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 5. 3.</NOTE> <HI>this is the
love of God</HI> (saith Saint <HI>John) that we
keep his commandments, and his command∣ments
are not grievous;</HI> 'tis the nature of
that Love to beget a free and delightfull
Obedience) Such then is the Subject of
our Discourse; even the sum, the soul,
the spring of all our Religion and Duty.
And because it is requisite, both for our
direction how to doe, and the examina∣tion
of our selves whether we doe as
we ought; that we should understand
what we are thus so far obliged to; that
we may be able to perform it, and that
we be effectually disposed thereto, I
shall use this method; I will first endea∣vour
to Explain the nature of this Love
commanded us; then to shew some
Means of Attaining it; lastly to pro∣pound
some Inducements to the Pur∣chase
and Practice thereof.</P>
<P>I. For the <HI>first</HI> part; we may describe
Love in general (for it seems not so easy
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
to define it exactly) to be an Affection
or Inclination of the Soul toward an
Object, proceeding from an Apprehen∣sion
and Esteem of some Excellency or
some Conveniency therein (its Beauty,
Worth, or Usefulness) producing there∣upon,
if the Object be absent or wan∣ting,
a proportionable desire, and con∣sequently
an endeavour to obtain such a
propriety therein, such a possession there∣of,
such an approximation or union there∣to,
as the thing is capable of; also a re∣gret
and displeasure in the failing so to
obtain it; or in the want, absence, and
loss thereof; likewise begetting a com∣placence,
satisfaction and delight in its
presence, possession or enjoyment; which
is moreover attended with a good-will
thereto, sutable to its nature; that is,
with a desire that it should arrive unto,
and continue in its best state; with a
delight to perceive it so to thrive and
flourish; with a displeasure to see it suf∣fer
or decay in any wise; with a conse∣quent
endeavour to advance it in all
good, and preserve it from all evil.
Which Description containing the chief
Properties of Love in common, do in
some sort (not to insist upon abstracted
Notions, or in Examples remote from
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
our purpose) all of them well agree to
that Love which we owe to God, ac∣cording
to the tenour of this Law, and
in the degree therein expressed; that is,
in the best manner, and highest degree;
for even of this Divine Love the chief
Properties (prerequisite thereto, or in∣timately
conjoined therewith, or natu∣rally
resulting from it) I conceive are
these.</P>
<P>1. A right apprehension and firm per∣suasion
concerning God, and consequent∣ly
a high esteem of him as most excel∣lent
in himself and most beneficial to us:
for such is the frame of our Soul, that
the perceptive part doth always go be∣fore
the appetitive, that affection follows
opinion, that no object otherwise moves
our desire, then as represented by rea∣son,
or by fancy, good unto us: what
effect will the goodliest beauty, or the
sweetest harmony have upon him, who
wants sense to discern, or judgment to
prize them? This is our natural way of
acting; and according to it, that we
may in due measure love God, He must
appear proportionably amiable, and de∣sirable
to us; we must entertain worthy
thoughts of him, as full of all Perfecti∣on
in himself; as the Fountain of all
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Good; as the sole Author of all that
Happiness we can hope for or receive;
as <HI>He,</HI> in possession of whom we shall
possess all things desirable; in effect and
vertue all riches, all honours, all plea∣sure,
all good that we are capable of;
and without whom we can enjoy no
real Good or true Content: Which
Esteem of him how can it otherwise
then beget Affection toward him? If
the faint resemblances, or the slender
participations of such Excellencies (of
that incomprehensible Wisedom, that
uncontrollable Power, that unconfined
Bounty, that unblemished Purity, which
are united in him, and shine from him
with a perfect lustre; if, I say, the very
faint resemblances, and imperfect parti∣cipations
of these Excellencies) discer∣ned
in other things are apt to raise our
Admiration, and allure our Affection
toward them; if the glimmering of
some small inconsiderable benefit, the
shadow of real profit discovered in these
inferiour empty things, is able so strong∣ly
to attract our eyes, and fix our hearts
upon them, why should not from a like,
but so much greater Cause the like Effect
proceed? whence can it be that the ap∣prehension
of an Object so infinitely
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
lovely, so incomparably beneficial (if
not passing cursorily through our fancy,
but deeply impressed upon our mind)
should not proportionably affect and in∣cline
us toward Him with all that desire,
that delight, that good will which are
proper to Love? If we think, as the
<HI>Psalmist</HI> did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 89. 6.</NOTE> that <HI>there is none in heaven
or in earth comparable to God</HI> (compa∣rable
in essential Perfection, comparable
in beneficial Influence) why should we
not be disposed also to say with him;
<HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 73. 25.</NOTE> <HI>and
there is none upon earth that I desire be∣sides
thee.</HI> Such a reverent Esteem is
the proper foundation upon which true
Love is built, and which upholds it:
whence, as the Love of God doth com∣monly
denote all the Duties of Religion,
so doth Fear (or Reverence to him)
likewise in Scripture style comprehend
and express them all; it being the Root
from whence Love doth sprout and by
which it is nourished;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>18. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 23. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 145.</NOTE> it being the be∣ginning
of that true Wisedom by which
we embrace and fasten our affection up∣on
the Sovereign Good. Hence we
may observe, that those devout persons,
whose hearts were fullest of this Love,
their minds were most employed in me∣ditation
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
upon the Divine Excellencies,
and upon the beneficial Emanations from
them in Bounty and Mercy upon the
Creatures; their Tongues being tuned
by their Thoughts, and their inward
Esteem breaking forth into Praise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 146. 7. 104. 33. 34. 1. 71. 15. 145. 2. 35. 28. 71. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Eve∣ry
day, all the day long, at all times did
they bless God, praise his name, speak
of his righteousness, shew forth his salva∣tion,</HI>
as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> expresses his practice,
arising from Love enlivened by the
esteem of God, and the apprehension of
his excellent Goodness: from whence al∣so
that strong Faith, that constant Hope,
that cheerful Confidence they reposed in
him; that hearty Approbation of all his
Counsels and Purposes; that full Acqui∣escence
of Mind in his Proceedings; that
entire Submission of their Understanding
to his Discipline, and Resignation of their
Will to his good pleasure; that yielding
up themselves (their Souls and Bodies,
their Lives and Goods) to his disposal,
with all the like high effects and preg∣nant
signs of Love did flow: but</P>
<P>2. Another property of this Love is
an earnest desire of obtaining a Proprie∣ty
in God; of possessing him (in a
manner) and enjoying him; of approa∣ching
him and being, so far as may be,
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
united to him. When we stand upon
such terms with any person, that we
have a free access unto and a familiar
entercourse with him; that his conver∣sation
is profitable and delightfull to us;
that we can upon all occasions have his
advice and assistance; that he is always
ready in our needs, and at our desire to
employ what is in him of ability for our
good and advantage, we may be said
to own such a person, to possess and
enjoy him; to be tyed (as it were) and
joined to him (as 'tis said <HI>the soul of
Ionathan was knit to the soul of David,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 18. 1.</NOTE>
<HI>so that he loved him as his own soul)</HI>
And such a propriety in, such a posses∣sion
of, such an alliance and conjunction
to himself God vouchsafes to them, who
are duely qualified for so great a good:
<HI>He was not ashamed</HI> (saith the Apostle
concerning the faithfull Patriarchs) <HI>to
be called their God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 16.</NOTE> to be appropriated
in a manner unto them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 2. 23.</NOTE> And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 2.</NOTE> <HI>He that
acknowledgeth the Son</HI> (saith Saint <HI>John</HI>
concerning good Christians) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 65. 1.</NOTE>
<HI>hath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 11. 22.</NOTE> (or possesseth) <HI>the Fa∣ther
also:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. 23. 8.</NOTE> and <HI>to seek;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6. 17.</NOTE> <HI>to find;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 11. 23.</NOTE> <HI>to draw
near to;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 15. 4. 17. 21.</NOTE> <HI>to cleave unto; to abide with, to
abide in,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 2. 24.</NOTE> and such other phrases frequent∣ly
do occur in Scripture denoting that
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
near relation which good men stand in
toward God; implying that he affords
them a continual liberty of access, and
coming into his especial presence, that
he admits them to a kind of converse
and communion with himself, full of
spiritual benefit and delight; that bea∣ring
an especial good will and favour
toward them, he is disposed to exert his
infinite wisedom and power in their be∣half;
is ready to impart all needfull and
convenient good unto them (help in
their needs, supply in wants, protection
in dangers; the direction, assistance and
comfort of his Holy Spirit; pardon of
sins and peace of conscience; all the
blessings of grace here, and all the feli∣cities
of glory hereafter) such an interest,
as it were, in God and a title unto him,
such a possession and enjoyment of him
we are capable of obtaining: and as that
enjoyment is in it self infinitely above all
things desirable; so if we love God, we
cannot surely but be earnestly desirous
thereof: a cold indifferency about it, a
faint wishing for it, a slothfull tendency
after it are much on this side love; it
will inflame our heart, it will transport
our mind, it will beget a vigorous and
lively motion of soul toward it: for Love
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
you know is commonly resembled unto,
yea even assumes the name of Fire; for
that it warms the breast, agitates the
spirits, quickens all the powers of Soul,
and sets them on work in desire and pur∣suance
of the beloved Object: you may
imagine as well fire without heat or
activity, as love without some ardency
of desire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 84. 2. 42. 1. 63. 1. 143. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Longing, and thirsting of soul;
fainting for, and panting after; crying
out, and stretching forth the hands to∣ward
God;</HI> such are the expressions sig∣nifying
the good <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s love; by so
apt, and so pathetical resemblances doth
he set out the vehemency of his desire
to enjoy God. I need not add concer∣ning
Endeavour; for that by plain con∣sequence
doth necessarily follow Desire:
the thirsty soul will never be at rest
till it have found out its convenient re∣freshment:
if we, as <HI>David</HI> did, do <HI>long
after God,</HI> we shall also with him <HI>ear∣nestly
seek God;</HI> nor ever be at rest till
we have found him. Coherent with
this is a</P>
<P>3. <HI>Third</HI> property of this Love, that
is, a great Complacence, Satisfaction and
Delight in the Enjoyment of God: in
the sense of having such a propriety in
him; in the partaking those emanations
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
of favour and beneficence from him;
and consequently in the instruments con∣veying,
in the means conducing to such
enjoyment: for joy and content are the
natural fruits of obtaining what we love,
what we much value, what we earnest∣ly
desire. Yea what we chiefly love,
if we become possessed thereof, we ea∣sily
rest satisfied therewith, although all
other comforts be wanting to us. The
covetous person for instance, who dotes
upon his wealth, let him be pinched
with the want of conveniencies; let his
body be wearied with toil; let his mind
be distracted with care; let him be sur∣rounded
with obloquy and disgrace
<HI>—at mihi plaudo ipse domi;</HI> he never∣theless
enjoys himself in beholding his
beloved pelf: the ambitious man like∣wise,
although his state be full of trouble
and disquiet; though he be the mark of
common envy and hatred; though he
be exposed to many crosses and dangers;
yet while he stands in power and digni∣ty,
among all those thorns of care and
fear, his heart enjoys much rest and
pleasure. In like manner we may ob∣serve
those pious men, whose hearts
were endewed with this love, by the
present sense, or assured hope of enjoying
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
God supporting themselves under all
wants and distresses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 6. 23.</NOTE> <HI>rejoycing,</HI> yea <HI>boa∣sting
and exulting</HI> in their afflictions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 13.</NOTE>
and no wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 5. 3.</NOTE> while they conceived
themselves secure in the possession of
their hearts wish;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 24.</NOTE> of that, which they
incomparably valued and desired above
all things; which by experience they
had found so comfortable and delicious:
<HI>O taste and see</HI> (exclaims the <HI>Psalmist,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 34. 8. 36. 7.</NOTE>
inspired with this passion) <HI>O taste and
see, that the Lord is good: How excel∣lent
is thy loving kindness, O Lord; they,</HI>
(they who enjoy it) <HI>shall be abundantly
satisfyed with the fatness of thy house,
and thou shalt make them drink of the
river of thy pleasures:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 84. 1, 10. 63. 5.</NOTE> <HI>A day in thy courts
is better than a thousand: my soul shall
be satisfyed as with marrow and fatness;</HI>
so did those devout practisers of this
Duty express the satisfaction they felt
in God, and in those things whereby he
did impart the enjoyment of himself un∣to
them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 9. 25.</NOTE> So did <HI>the light of Gods</HI> coun∣tenance
cheer their heart;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 4. 6. 63. 3.</NOTE> so did <HI>his lo∣ving
kindness</HI> appear <HI>better than life it self
unto them.</HI> Hence do they so frequently
enjoin and exhort us <HI>to be glad;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 33. 1. 32. 11. 105. 3. 107. 12. 37. 4.</NOTE> <HI>to de∣light
our selves; to glory; to rejoyce con∣tinually
in the Lord;</HI> in the sense of his
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>
goodness, in the hope of his favour; the
doing so being an inseparable property
of love; to which we adjoin another.</P>
<P>4. The feeling much displeasure and
regret in being deprived of such enjoy∣ment;
in the absence or distance as it
were of God from us; the loss or les∣sening
of his favour; the subtraction of
his gracious influences from us: for sure∣ly
answerable to the love we bear unto
any thing will be our grief for the want
or loss thereof: it was a shrewd argu∣ment
which the <HI>Poet</HI> used to prove that
men loved their moneys better than their
friends, because—<HI>majore tumultu plo∣rantur
nummi, quàm funera</HI>—they more
lamented the loss of those than the death
of these; Indeed, that which a man prin∣cipally
affects, if he is bereaved thereof,
be his condition otherwise how prospe∣rous
and comfortable soever, he cannot
be contented; all other enjoyments be∣come
unsavoury and unsatisfactory to
him. And so it is in our case, when
God, although onely for trial, (accor∣ding
to his wisedom and good pleasure)
hides his face, and withdraws his hand;
leaving the soul in a kind of desolation
and darkness; not finding that ready aid
in distress, not feeling that cheefull vi∣vacity
<PB N="18" REF="13"/>
in obedience, not tasting that
sweet relish of devotion, which have
been usually afforded thereto; if love
reside in the heart, it will surely dispose
it to a sensible grief; it will inspire such
exclamations as those of the <HI>Psalmist:
How long,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 89. 46. 69. 16. 30. 7. 42. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Lord, wilt thou hide thy face?
hide not thy face from thy servant, for I
am in trouble; turn unto me according to
the multitude of thy tender mercies;
draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it.</HI>
Even our Saviour himself in such a case,
when God seemed for a time to with∣draw
the light of his countenance, and
the protection of his helpfull hand from
him (or to frown and lay his heavy
hand upon him) had his soul <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 26. 38. 27. 46.</NOTE>
<HI>extreamly grieved</HI> and
<HI>full of a deadly anguish;</HI> neither surely
was it any other cause than excess of
love, which made that temporary deser∣tion
so grievous and bitter to him, ex∣torting
from his most meek and patient
heart that wofull complaint, <HI>My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me!</HI> But
especially, when <HI>our iniquities have</HI> (as
the <HI>Prophet</HI> expresseth it) <HI>separated be∣tween
our God and us;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 59. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>our sins have
hid his face from us;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 5. 25.</NOTE> when that <HI>thick
cloud</HI> hath eclipsed the light of his coun∣tenance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 44. 26.</NOTE>
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
and intercepted his gracious in∣fluences;
when by wilfully offending
we have (as the <HI>Israelites</HI> are said to
have done) <HI>rejected our God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8. 7 10. 9.</NOTE> <HI>cast him
off,</HI> and <HI>driven him from us;</HI> so depri∣ving
our selves of propriety in him, and
the possession of his favour; then if any
love be alive in us, it will prompt us
with those good men in their peniten∣tial
agonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 6. 35. 38. 51. 102. 130. 143.</NOTE> to be grievously sensible of,
and sorely to bewail that our wretched
condition; there <HI>will not</HI> (if we so hear∣tily
love God, and value his favour as
they did) <HI>be any soundness in our flesh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 38. 3. 143. 4. 102. 4.</NOTE>
<HI>or rest in our bones; our spirit will be
overwhelmed within us, and our heart
within us desolate. Our heart will be
smitten and withered like grass,</HI> upon the
consideration and sense of so inestimable
a loss. Love will render such a condition
very sad and uneasie to us; will make
all other delights insipid and distastfull;
all our life will become bitter and bur∣then
some to us; neither if it in any mea∣sure
abides in us, shall we receive con∣tent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 6. 4. 38. 21. 51. 11. 102. 2. 143.</NOTE>
till by humble deprecation we have
regained some glimpse of God's favour,
some hope of being reinstated in our
possession of him. Farther yet,</P>
<P>5. Another property of this Love is
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>
to bear the highest good will toward
God; so as to wish heartily and effec∣tually
(according to our power) to pro∣cure
all good to him, and to delight in
it; so as to endeavour to prevent and to
remove all evil (if I may so speak) that
may befall him, and to be heartily dis∣pleased
therewith. Although no such
benefit or advantage can accrue to God
which may increase his essential and in∣defectible
happiness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 16. 2.</NOTE> no harm or dam∣mage
can arrive that may impaire it
(for he can be neither really more or
less rich,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 22. 3.</NOTE> or glorious, or joyfull than he
is; neither have our desire or our fear,
our delight or our grief, our designs or
our endeavours any object, any ground
in those respects) yet hath he declared,
that there be certain interests and con∣cernments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 9. 24.</NOTE>
which, out of his abundant
goodness and condescension, he doth
tender and prosecute as his own; as if
he did really receive advantage by the
good, and prejudice by the bad success
respectively belonging to them; that he
earnestly desires, and is greatly delighted
with some things, very much dislikes,
and is grievously displeased with other
things: for instance, that he bears a fa∣therly
affection toward his creatures, and
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>
earnestly desires their welfare; and de∣lights
to see them enjoy the good he de∣signed
them; as also dislikes the contra∣ry
events; doth commiserate and con∣dole
their misery; that he is consequent∣ly
well pleased, when piety and justice,
peace and order (the chief means con∣ducing
to our welfare) do flourish; and
displeased, when impiety and iniquity,
dissension and disorder (those certain
sources of mischief to us) do prevail;
that he is well satisfied with our ren∣dring
to him that obedience, honour
and respect which are due to him; and
highly offended with our injurious and
disrespectfull behaviour toward him, in
commission of sin and violation of his
most just and holy commandments: so
that there wants not sufficient matter
of our exercising good will both in af∣fection
and action toward God; we are
capable both of wishing, and (in a man∣ner,
as he will interpret and accept it)
of doing good to him, by our concur∣rence
with him in promoting those
things which he approves and delights
in, and in removing the contrary. And
so surely shall we do if we truly love
God: for love, as it would have the ob∣ject
to be its own, as it tends to enjoy
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>
it, so it would have it in its best state,
and would put it thereinto, and would
conserve it therein; and would thence
contribute all it is able to the welfare,
to the ornament, to the pleasure and
content thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quid est a∣mare, nisi velle bonis aliquem af∣fici quàm maximis? <HI>Cic.</HI> de Fin. 2.</NOTE> <HI>What is it</HI> (saith <HI>Ci∣cero)
to love, but to will or desire, that
the person loved should receive the grea∣test
good that can be?</HI> Love also doth
reconcile, conform, and unite the incli∣nations
and affections of him who loves,
to the inclinations and affections of him
who is beloved; <HI>Eadem velle &amp; eadem
nolle, to consent in liking and disliking
of things,</HI> if it be not the cause, if it be
not the formall reason or essence (as some
have made it) 'tis at least a certain effect
of love. If then we truly love God, we
shall desire that all his designs prosper,
that his pleasure be fulfilled, that all du∣ty
be performed, all glory rendred to
him: we shall be grieved at the wrong,
the dishonour, the disappointment he
receives: especially we shall endeavour
in our own practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 13. 22.</NOTE> with Holy <HI>David,
to perform</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>all
that God wills,</HI> desires, or delights in;
to eschew whatever offends him. Our
desire, our delight, our endeavour will
conspire with and be subordinate to his:
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>
for it would be a strange kind of love,
that were consistent with the voluntary
doing of that, which is hurtfull, injuri∣ous,
or offensive to that we love; such
actions being the proper effects, the na∣tural
signs of hatred and enmity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 4. 20. 3. 17.</NOTE> <HI>If any
man say, I love God, and hateth his bro∣ther,
he is a liar,</HI> saith Saint <HI>John;</HI> and,
<HI>If any man seeth his brother need, and
shutteth his bowels toward him, how doth
the love of God abide in him?</HI> He that
in his affections is so unlike, so contrary
unto God; he that is unwilling to com∣ply
with God's will in so reasonable a
performance; he that in a matter, where∣in
God hath declared himself so much
concerned, and so affected therewith,
doth not care to cross him, to displease
and disappoint him; how can he with
any shew of truth, or with any mode∣sty
pretend to love God? Hence it is,
that keeping of God's Commandments
is commonly represented to us as the
most proper expression, as the surest ar∣gument
of our love to God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 20. 6.</NOTE>—<HI>shewing
mercy to thousands of them that love me,
and keep my commandments;</HI> they are
joined together as terms equivalent, or
as inseparable companions in effect:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 14. 21. 23.</NOTE> <HI>He
that hath my commandments and keepeth
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>
them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 15. 14.</NOTE> <HI>he it is that loveth me: Ye are
my friends,</HI> (that is, not onely objects
of my affection, but actively friends,
bearing affection unto me) <HI>if you doe
whatsoever I command you,</HI> saith our <HI>Sa∣viour:</HI>
And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 4. 12.</NOTE> <HI>whoso keepeth his word, in
him is the love of God truly perfected;</HI>
(he hath the truth and sincerity; he
hath the integrity and consummation of
love; without it love is wholly false and
counterfeit, or very lame and imperfect;
so the loving and beloved Disciple tea∣ches
us). For by doing thus, as we
signifie our esteem of God's wisedom
which directeth us, our dread of his
power and justice that can punish us,
our hope in his goodness and fidelity to
reward us, our regard to his majesty and
authority over us; so especially thereby
(if our obedience at least be free and
cheerfull)▪ we express our good will to∣ward
him; shewing thereby, that we
are disposed to do him all the good and
gratifie him all we can; that his inte∣rests,
his honour, his content are dear
and precious to us. And were indeed
our <HI>hearts knit unto God</HI> with this bond
of perfection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 86. 11.</NOTE> we could not in our wills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 14.</NOTE>
and consequently in our practice be so
severed from him; we should also love
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>
heartily all vertue and goodness, the
nearest resemblances of him, and which
he chiefly loves; we should doe, what
<HI>David</HI> so oft professes himself to doe,
<HI>love his law,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 11. 7.</NOTE> <HI>and greatly delight in his
commandments.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 163, 165, 113, 16, 35, 70, 47, 24, 77.</NOTE> With our Saviour, we
should <HI>delight to perform his will;</HI> it
would (as it was to him) <HI>be our meat
and our drink to doe</HI> it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 1. 2. 112. 1. 40. 8.</NOTE> <HI>his yoke would
be easie</HI> indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 7.</NOTE> <HI>and his burthen light</HI> un∣to
us;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 4. 34. 5. 30.</NOTE> his yoke so easie, that we should
wear it rather as a jewel about our necks
than as a yoke;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 3. 22.</NOTE> his burthen so light,
that we should not feel it as a burthen,
but esteem it our privilege. We should
not be so dull in apprehending, or so
slack in performing duty; for this sharp∣sighted
affection would presently discern,
would readily suggest it to us; by the
least intimation it would perceive what
pleaseth God, and would snatch oppor∣tunity
of doing it: we should not need
any arguments to persuade us, nor any
force to compell us, love would inspire
us with sufficient vigour and alacrity;
it would urge and stimulate us forward
not onely <HI>to walk in,</HI> but even (as the
<HI>Psalmist</HI> expresseth it) to <HI>run the ways
of God's commandments.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>But let thus much serve for explication
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>
of the nature of this Duty; in order (as
was before said) to the direction of our
Practice, and examination thereof: The
particular Duties mentioned being com∣prehended
in, or appertaining to the love
of God, if we perceive that we practise
them, we may, to our satisfaction and
comfort, infer, that proportionably we are
endewed with this Grace; if not, we
have reason (such as should beget re∣morse
and pious sorrow in us) to suspect
we abide in a state of disaffection or of
indifferency toward him. If we find the
former good disposition, we should strive
to cherish and improve it; if the second
bad one, we should (as we tender our
own welfare and happiness, as we would
avoid utter ruine and misery) endeavour
to remove it.</P>
<P>II. To the effecting of which purposes
I shall next propound some means con∣ducible;
some in way of removing Ob∣stacles,
others by immediately promoting
the Duty.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>first</HI> kind are these ensuing:</P>
<P>1. The destroying of all loves opposite
to the love of God, extinguishing all af∣fection
to things odious and offensive to
God; mortifying all corrupt and per∣verse,
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>
all unrighteous and unholy de∣sires<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 97. 10. Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.</NOTE>.
It agrees with souls no less than
with bodies, that they cannot at once
move or tend contrary ways; upward
and downward, backward and forward
at one time: it is not possible we should
together truly esteem, earnestly desire,
bear sincere good will to things in na∣ture
and inclination quite repugnant
each to other. No man ever took him
for his real friend, who maintains cor∣respondency,
secret or open; who joins
in acts of hostility with his professed
enemies; at least we cannot, as we
ought, love God with our whole heart,
if with any part thereof we affect his
enemies; those, which are mortally and
irreconcileably so; as are all iniquity and
impurity, all inordinate lusts both of
flesh and spirit:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>the carnal mind</HI> (the
minding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 7.</NOTE> or affecting of the flesh) <HI>is,</HI>
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, <HI>enmity toward God;
for 'tis not subject to the law of God, nor
can be;</HI> 'tis an enemy, even the worst
of enemies, an incorrigibly obstinate re∣bell
against God, and can we then retai∣ning
any love to God, or peace with
him, comply and conspire therewith?
And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 4. 4.</NOTE> <HI>The friendship of the world</HI> (that
is I suppose of those corrupt principles,
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>
and those vitious customs which usually
prevail in the world) <HI>is also,</HI> Saint <HI>James</HI>
tells us, <HI>enmity with God;</HI> so that (he
adds) <HI>if any man be a friend to the world,
he is thereby constituted</HI> (he immediate∣ly
<HI>ipso facto</HI> becomes) <HI>an enemy to God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
Saint <HI>John</HI> affirms the same:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 2. 15.</NOTE> <HI>If any man
love the world, the love of the father is
not in him;</HI> explaining himself, that by
the world he means those things, which
are most generally embraced and practi∣sed
therein;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>the lust,</HI> or desire <HI>of the flesh,</HI>
(that is, sensuality and intemperance)
<HI>the lust of the eyes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> (that is, envy, cove∣tousness,
vain curiosity, and the like)
<HI>the ostentation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> or boasting <HI>of life</HI> (that
is, pride, ambition, vain-glory, arrogance)
qualities as irreconcileably opposite to the
holy nature and will of God, so altoge∣ther
inconsistent with the love of him;
begetting in us an aversation and antipa∣thy
towards him; rendring his holiness
distastfull to our affections, and his ju∣stice
dreadfull to our consciences; and
himself consequently, his will, his law,
his presence hatefull to us: while we
take him to be our enemy and to hate
us, we shall certainly in like manner
stand affected toward him: this indeed
is the main obstacle, the removal of
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>
which will much facilitate the introduc∣tion
of divine love; it being a great step
to reconciliation and friendship, to be
disengaged from the adverse party: we
should then easily discern the beauty of
divine goodness and sanctity, when the
mists of ignorance, of errour, of corrupt
prejudice, arising from those gross carnal
affections, were dissipated; we should
better relish the sweet and savoury gra∣ces
of God, when the palate of our mind
were purged from vitious tinctures; we
should be more ready to hope for peace
and favour in his eyes, when our con∣sciences
were freed from the sense of such
provocations and defilements. But</P>
<P>2. If we would obtain this excellent
Grace, we must restrain our affections
toward all other things, however in
their nature innocent, and indifferent.
The young Gentleman in the Gospel
had,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> it seems,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 19. 20.</NOTE> arrived to the former
pitch;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 10. 21. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> having through the course of his
life abstained from grosser iniquities and
impurities;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 18. 22.</NOTE> so far, that our Saviour in
regard to that attaiment of his concei∣ved
an affection for him (he loved him,
'tis said) yet was not he sufficiently dis∣posed
to love God; being <HI>in one thing
deficient,</HI> that he retained an immode∣rate
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>
affection to his wealth and worldly
conveniencies; with which sort of af∣fections
the love of God cannot consist:
for we much undervalue God, and can∣not
therefore duly love him, if we deem
any thing comparable to him, or consi∣derable
in worth or usefulness when he
comes in competition: if we deem, that
the possession of any other thing beside
him, can confer to our happiness, or the
want thereof can prejudice it, and make
us miserable: no other love should bear
any proportion to the love of him; no
other object should appear (as indeed
none really is) simply good, desirable or
amiable to us. What value Saint <HI>Paul</HI>
had of his legal qualifications and privi∣leges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3. 8.</NOTE>
the same should we have concer∣ning
all other things in appearance plea∣sant
or convenient to us; they ought, in
regard to God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> to <HI>seem dammage and
dung;</HI> not onely mean and despicable,
but even sordid and loathsome to us;
not onely unworthy of our regard and
desire, but deserving our hatred and ab∣horrency;
we should, I say, even hate
the best of them; so our Saviour expres∣seth
it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 14. 26.</NOTE> <HI>If any man doth not hate his fa∣ther
and his mother, his wife and his
children, his brothers and sisters, and
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>
even his own soul</HI> (or his own life) <HI>he
cannot be my disciple;</HI> that is, if any
man retain in his heart any affection
not infinitely (as it were) less than that
which he bears to God; if any thing be
in comparison dear and precious to him,
he is not disposed to entertain the main
point of Christ's discipline, the sincere
and entire love of God. To <HI>love him,</HI>
as he requires, <HI>with all our heart,</HI> im∣plies,
that our heart be filled with his
love, so that no room be left for any
other passion to enter or dwell there.
And indeed such, if we observe it, is
the nature of our soul, we can hardly
together harbour earnest or serious af∣fections
toward different objects; one of
them will prevail and predominate; and
so doing will not suffer the other to re∣main,
but will extrude or extinguish it:
No heart of man can correspond with two
rivals, but, (as our Saviour teacheth us)
<HI>it will hate and despise one,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 6. 24.</NOTE> <HI>will love and
stick to the other;</HI> whence he infers, that
<HI>we cannot serve</HI> (that is, affectionately
adhere to) <HI>both God and Mammon.</HI> If
we have (according to the <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s
phrase) <HI>set our hearts upon wealth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 62. 10.</NOTE> and
<HI>will be rich</HI> (are resolved to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 6, 9, 17.</NOTE> as
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> expresseth it) if we eagerly
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>
aspire to power and honour, with the
Pharisees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 12. 43.</NOTE> <HI>preferring the applause of men
before the favour of God;</HI> if any worldly
or bodily pleasure, or any curiosity how
plausible soever, hath seised upon our
spirits and captivated our affections; if
any inferiour object whatever with its
apparent splendour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 4. 10.</NOTE> sweetness, goodli∣ness,
convenience hath so inveagled our
fancy, that we have an exceeding esteem
thereof, and a greedy appetite thereto;
that we enjoy it with huge content, and
cannot part from it without much re∣gret;
that thing doth at present take up
God's place within us; so that our heart
is uncapable, at least in due measure, of
divine love: but if we be indifferently
affected toward all such things, and are
unconcerned in the presence or absence
of them; esteeming them as they are
mean and vain; loving them as they de∣serve,
as inferiour and trivial; if (accor∣ding
to Saint <HI>Paul</HI>'s direction) <HI>we use
them as if we used them not;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7. 31.</NOTE> 'tis another
good step toward the love of God: the
divine light will shine more brightly in∣to
so calm and serene a <HI>medium:</HI> a soul
void of other affections, will not be one∣ly
more capable to receive, but apt to
suck in that heavenly one; being insen∣sible,
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>
in any considerable degree, of all
other comforts and complacencies, we
shall be apt to search after, and reach
out at that, which alone can satisfie our
understanding, and satiate our desires;
especially if we add hereto,</P>
<P>3. The freeing of our hearts also from
immoderate affection to our selves (I
mean not from a sober desire or an ear∣nest
regard to our own true good; for
this as nature enforces to, so all reason
allows, and even God's command obli∣geth
us to; nor can it be excessive; but
a high conceit of our selves as worthy
or able, a high confidence in any thing
we have within us or about us) for this
is a very strong bar against the entrance,
as of all other charity, so especially
of this: for as the love of an external
object doth thrust, as it were, our soul
outwards towards it; so the love of our
selves detains it within, or draws it in∣wards;
and consequently these inclina∣tions
crossing each other cannot both
have effect, but one will subdue and de∣stroy
the other. If our mind be—<HI>Ipsa

care to go farther; we will not be at the

in our opinion, we can so readily find,

and dote upon our selves, we there
by put our selves into God's stead, and
usurp the throne due to him in our
hearts; comparing our selves to God▪
and in effect preferring our selves before
him; thereby consequently shutting our
that unparallel'd esteem, that predomi∣nant
affection we owe to him: while
we are busie in dressing and decking, in
courting and worshipping this Idol o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
our fancy, we shall be estranged from
the true object of our devotion; both
we shall willingly neglect him, and he
in just indignation will desert us. But
if as all other things, so even our selves
do appear exceedingly vile and contemp¦tible,
foul and ugly in comparison to
God; If we <HI>take our selves</HI> to be (as
truly we are) meer <HI>nothings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 3.</NOTE> or some
things worse; not onely destitute of all
considerable perfections, but full of great
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>
defects; blind and fond in our conceits,
crooked and perverse in our wills, infirm
and unstable in all our powers, unable
to discern, unwilling to embrace, back∣ward
to set upon, inconstant in prosecu∣ting
those things, which are truly good
and advantagious to us; If we have, I
say, this right opinion and judgment of
our selves, seeing within us nothing love∣ly
or desirable, no proper object there of
our esteem or affection, no bottom to
rest our mind upon, no ground of solid
comfort at home, we shall then be apt
to look abroad, to direct our eyes, and
settle our affections upon somewhat more
excellent in it self, or more beneficial to
us, that seems better to deserve our re∣gard,
and more able to supply our de∣fects.
And if all other things about us
appear alike deformed and deficient (un∣worthy
our affection and unable to sa∣tisfie
our desires) then may we be dis∣posed
to seek, to find, to fasten and re∣pose
our soul upon the onely proper ob∣ject
of our love; in whom we shall ob∣tain
all that we need, infallible wisedom
to guide us, omnipotent strength to help
us, infinite goodness for us to admire and
enjoy.</P>
<P>These are the chief Obstacles, the re∣moving
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>
of which conduce to the beget∣ting
and increasing the love of God in us.
A soul so cleansed from love to bad and
filthy things, so emptied of affection to
vain and unprofitable things, so opened
and dilated by excluding all conceit of,
all confidence in its self, is a vessel pro∣per
for the divine love to be infused in∣to;
into so large and pure a vacuity (as
finer substances are apt to flow of them∣selves
into spaces void of grosser matter)
that free and movable Spirit of divine
grace will be ready to succeed, and there∣in
to disperse it self. As all other things
in nature, the cloggs being removed
which hinder them, do presently tend
with all their force to the place of their
rest and well being; so would, it seems,
our souls being loosed from baser affecti∣ons
obstructing them, willingly incline
toward God, the natural centre (as it
were) and bosome of their affection;
would resume (as <HI>Origen</HI> speaks) that
<HI>natural philtre</HI> (that intrinsick spring,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
or incentive of love) <HI>which all creatures
have toward their creatour;</HI> especially,
if to these we add those positive Instru∣ments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orig. <HI>in</HI> Cels. <HI>p.</HI> 135.</NOTE>
which are more immediately and
directly subservient to the production of
this love; they are these:</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="22"/>
1. Attentive consideration of the di∣vine
Perfections, with endeavour to ob∣tain
a right and clear apprehension of
them.</P>
<P>2. The consideration of God's Works
and Actions: his works and actions of
nature, of providence, of grace.</P>
<P>3. Serious regard and reflection upon
the peculiar Benefits by the divine Good∣ness
vouchsafed to our selves.</P>
<P>4. An earnest resolution and endea∣vour
to perform God's Commandments,
although upon inferiour considerations of
reason; upon hope, fear, desire to attain
the benefits of Obedience, to shun the
mischiefs from Sin.</P>
<P>5. Assiduous Prayer to Almighty God,
that he in mercy would please to bestow
his love upon us, and by his Grace to
work it in us.</P>
<P>But I must forbear the prosecution of
these things, rather than farther trespass
upon your patience. Let us conclude
all with a good <HI>Collect,</HI> sometimes used
by our Church:</P>
<P>O Lord, who hast taught us, that all
our doings without charity are nothing
worth, send thy Holy Ghost, and pour in∣to
our hearts that most excellent gift of
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>
charity, the very bond of peace and of all
vertues, without which whosoever liveth
is counted dead before thee; Grant this

<Q>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>WHich is the great Command∣ment?</HI>
was the question, in
answer whereto our Saviour
returns this Text; and that with high∣est
reason (discernible by every man)
for that of necessity the love of God is
the principal duty we owe unto him;
the great duty indeed, as being largest in
extent, and comprehending in a manner
all other duties of piety; as that which
exceeds in proper worth and dignity
(employing the noblest faculties of our
souls in their best operations upon the
most excellent object) as that, which
communicates vertue unto, and hath
a special influence upon all other duties;
in fine, as that, which is the sum, the
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>
soul, the spring of all other duties: in
discoursing whereupon, I did formerly
propound this method; <HI>first,</HI> to declare
the nature thereof; <HI>then,</HI> to shew some
means apt to beget and improve that
excellent vertue in us; <HI>lastly,</HI> to pro∣pose
some inducements to the practice
thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> part I endeavoured to per∣form,
by describing it according to its
essential properties (common to love in
general, and more particularly to this)
of duly esteeming God, of desiring (ac∣cording
as we are capable) to possess and
enjoy him, of receiving delight and sa∣tisfaction
in the enjoyment of him, of
feeling displeasure in being deprived
hereof, of bearing good will unto him,
expressed by endeavours to please him,
by delighting in the advancement of his
glory, by grieving when he is disserved
or dishonoured.</P>
<P>The next <HI>part</HI> I also entred upon, and
offered to consideration those means,
which serve chiefly to remove the im∣pediments
of our love to God; which
were,</P>
<P>1. The suppressing all affections oppo∣site
to this; all perverse and corrupt, all
unrighteous and unholy desires.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="24"/>
2. The restraining or keeping within
bounds of moderation our affections to∣ward
other things, even in their nature
innocent or indifferent.</P>
<P>3. The freeing our hearts from immo∣derate
affection toward our selves; from
all conceit of, and confidence in any
qualities or abilities of our own; the di∣ligent
use of which means I did suppose
would conduce much to the production
and increase of divine love within us.</P>
<P>To them I shall now proceed to sub∣join
other Instruments more immediate∣ly
and directly subservient to the same
purpose: whereof the <HI>first</HI> is,</P>
<P>1. Attentive consideration upon the
divine Perfections,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Bas.</HI> de Jud. Dei. Tom. 2. p. 261.</NOTE> with endeavour to
obtain a right and clear apprehension of
them: as counterfeit worth and beauty
receive advantage by distance and dark∣ness;
so real excellency—<HI>si propius stes
Te capiet magis—</HI> the greater light you
view it in, the nearer you approach it,
the more strictly you examine it, the
more you will approve and like it; so
the more we think of God, the better we
know him, the fuller and clearer con∣ceptions
we have of him, the more we
shall be apt to esteem and desire him,
the more excellent in himself, the more
<PB N="42" REF="25"/>
beneficial to us he will appear. Hence
is the knowledge of God represented in
holy Writ not onely as a main instru∣ment
of Religion, but as an essential
character thereof;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 2. 20.</NOTE> as equivalent to the
being well affected toward God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 36. 10. 9. 10.</NOTE> <HI>O con∣tinue</HI>

<HI>He that loveth not</HI> (saith Saint <HI>John)

God is an evident sign, a natural effect
of ignorance concerning him: indeed con∣sidering
the nature of our mind, and its
ordinary method of operation, it seems
impossible, that such perfection discerned
should not beget answerable reverence
and affection thereto: if beautifull spec∣tacles,
harmonious sounds, fragrant o∣dours,
delicate savours do necessarily
and certainly please the respective senses;
<PB N="43" REF="25"/>
why should not with the like sure effi∣cacy
the proper objects of our mind af∣fect
it, if duly represented and conveyed
thereto? If the wit of the most ingeni∣ous
Artists, the cunning of the deepest
Politicians, the wisedom of the sagest
Philosophers are but meer blindness and
stupidity in comparison to the wisedom
of God; the lowest instance or expres∣sion
of whose wisedom (his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>his folly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1. 25.</NOTE> as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> speaks) <HI>is wiser
than men,</HI> doth excell the results of man's
highest wisedom; yet them we admire
and commend in men, why then do we
not much more adore the divine wise∣dome?
If the abilities of them, who
dexterously manage great business, or
atchieve prosperously great exploits are
indeed meer impotency in regard to
God's power; <HI>whose weaknesse</HI> (that
is, the smallest effects of whose power)
is (as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> again tells us) <HI>stron∣ger
than men,</HI> surpasses the utmost re∣sults
of humane endeavour; yet those
things in men we extol and celebrate,
how can we then forbear to reve∣rence
the divine power? If the dis∣pensers
of freest and largest boun∣ty
among men, the noblest patriots,
the most munificent benefactours, the
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>
most tenderly affectionate friends be in
respect of God unworthy to be counted
or called good (as our Saviour tells us;
<HI>If ye being bad know to give good things;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 7. 11.</NOTE>
and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 11. 13.</NOTE> <HI>There is none good, but God;)</HI> yet
such persons are much beloved and ap∣plauded;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 19. 17.</NOTE>
how then can we abstain from
paying the like measure of affection and
respect to the divine goodness? if good
qualities so inferiour and defective ob∣tain
so much from us, whence comes it
that the infinitely superiour and most
perfect excellencies of God do not beget
in their proportion a sutable regard and
veneration in us toward him? whence,
if not either from our not firmly belie∣ving
them, or not rightly apprehending
them, or not attentively considering
them? Our belief of them in gross and
at large we may suppose, as connected
with the belief of God's existence, and
included in the very notion of God; the
defect therefore must proceed from the
remaining causes, want of a right
apprehension, or neglect of attentive
consideration about them: as to the first
of these; it is common for men to have
confused, imperfect and wrong concep∣tions
about the Divine Attributes, espe∣cially
in the recesses of their mind;
<PB N="45" REF="26"/>
which although they spare to utter with
their mouths, yet they vent in their prac∣tice:
if we, for instance, imagine that
we can comprehend the extent of God's
designs, or fathome the depth of his coun∣sels;
if we measure and model his rea∣sons
of proceeding according to our fancy
(as <HI>if his thoughts were as our thoughts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 55. 8.</NOTE>
<HI>and his ways as our ways;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 16. 7.</NOTE> or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 29. 19.</NOTE> as if he

counsels and devices although repugnant

taking these not to befit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 18. 12.</NOTE> or not to con∣cern

reproved for doing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 73. 11. 10. 11. 94. 7.</NOTE> we greatly
mistake and undervalue that glorious
Attribute of God (his Wisedom) and
no wonder then, if we do not upon ac∣compt
thereof duly reverence and love
God: likewise if we concerning the di∣vine
Power conceit, that notwithstan∣ding
it, we shall be able to accomplish
our unlawfull designs; that <HI>we</HI> may (as
it is in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Job 9. 4. Isa. 45. 9. 10. 15. 54. 17. 1 Cor. 10. 22. Deut. 33. 8. Dan. 5. 23. Amos 9. 2. Isa. 2. 19. Jer. 16. 16. Deut. 28. 29. Numb. 14. 41. 2 Chr. 13. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Job) harden our hearts against

either withstand, or evade his power
(as also many are intimated to doe, in
Scripture; even generally all those who
dare presumptuously to offend God) we
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>
also misconceive of that excellent Attri∣bute;
and the contempt of God, rather
then love of him will thence arise. If
concerning the divine goodness and holi∣ness,
we imagine that God is disaffected
toward his Creatures (antecedently to
all demerits, or bad qualifications in
them) yea indifferent in affection to∣ward
them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Plat.</HI> de Leg. 10.</NOTE> inclinable to do them harm,
or not propense to do them good; if
we deem him apt to be harsh and rigo∣rous
in his proceedings, to exact perfor∣mances
unsutable to the strength he hath
given us, to impose burthens intolerable
upon us; will not such thoughts be apt
to breed in us toward God (as they
would toward any other person so dis∣posed)
rather a servile dread (little dif∣ferent
from downright hatred) or an
hostile aversation, than a genuine reve∣rence
or a kindly affection toward him?
If we fancy him, like to pettish man,
apt to be displeased without cause, or
beyond measure, for our doing some∣what
innocent (neither bad in it self,
nor prejudicial to publick or private
good) or for our omitting that, which
no law, no good reason plainly requires
of us; what will such thoughts but
sowre our spirits toward him, make us
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
fearfull and suspicious of him; which
sort of dispositions are inconsistent with
true love? If on the other side, we judge
him fond and partial in his affections;
or slack and easie (as it were) in his
proceedings; apt to favour us, although
we neglect him; to indulge us in our
sins, or connive at our miscarriages;
will not such thoughts rather incline us
in our hearts to slight him, and in our
actions insolently to dally with him,
than heartily and humbly to love him?
if we conceit his favour procured, or
his anger appeased by petty observances,
perhaps without any good rule or rea∣son
affected by our selves, when we
neglect duties of greater worth and con∣sequence
<HI>(the more weighty matters of
the Law);</HI> what is this but in stead of
God to reverence an Idol of our own
fancy; to yield unto him (who is one∣ly
pleased with holy dispositions of mind,
with real effects of goodness) not duties
of humble love, but acts of presumption
and flattery? But if contrariwise, we
truly conceive of God's wisedom, that
his counsels are always throughly good,
and that we are concerned both in duty
and interest to follow them, although
exceeding the reach of our understan∣ding,
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
or contrary to the suggestions of
our fancy; concerning his power, that
it will certainly interpose it self to the
hindrance of our bad projects, that it
will be in vain to contest therewith,
that we must submit unto, or shall be
crushed by his hand; concerning his
goodness, that as he is infinitely good
and benign, so he is also perfectly holy
and pure; as he wisheth us all good, and
is ready to promote it, so he detesteth
our sins, nor will suffer us to doe him∣self,
our selves and our neighbour any
wrong; as most bountifull in dispensing
his favours, so not prodigal of them, or
apt to cast them away on such as little
value them, and do not endeavour to
answer them; as a faithfull rewarder of
all true vertue and piety, so a severe
chastiser of all iniquity and profaneness;
as full of mercy and pity toward them,
who are sensible of their unworthiness,
and penitent for their faults, so an impla∣cable
avenger of obstinate and incorrigible
wickedness; in fine, as a true friend to us,
if we be not wilfull enemies to him; and
desirous of our welfare, if we do not
perversly render our selves incapable
thereof, so withall jealous of his own
honour, resolute to maintain and vindi∣cate
<PB N="49" REF="28"/>
his just authority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 5. 4.</NOTE> carefull to uphold
the interests of right and truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hab. 1. 13.</NOTE> and to
shew the distinction he makes between
good and evil;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 5. 4. 11. 5. &amp;c.</NOTE> if we have, I say, such
conceptions of God (agreeable to what
his word and his doings represent him to
us) how can we otherwise than bear a
most high respect, a most great affection
unto him? A Prince surely endewed
with such qualities; wise and powerfull,
good and just together; tendering the
good of his people, yet preserving the
force of his Laws; designing always
what is best, and constantly pursuing
his good intentions; tempering bounty
and clemency with needfull justice and
severity; we should all commend and
extol as worthy of most affectionate ve∣neration;
how much more then shall we
be so affected toward him, in whom we
apprehend all those excellencies to con∣cur
without any imperfection or allay?
especially if by attention we impress
those conceptions upon our hearts; for
how true and proper soever, if they be
onely slight and transient, they may not
suffice to this intent; if they pass away
as a slash, they will not be able to kindle
in us any strong affection. But if such
abstracted consideration of the divine
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
perfections will not alone wholly avail,
let us add hereto as a farther help to∣ward
the production and encrease of this
divine grace in us,</P>
<P>2. The consideration of God's Works
and Actions; his works of nature, his
acts of providence, his works and acts
of grace; the carefull meditating upon
these will be apt to breed, to nourish,
to improve and augment this affection
Even the contemplation of the lower
works of nature, of this visible frame of
things (upon which indeed many per∣spicuous
characters of divine perfection,
of immense power, of admirable wise∣dom,
of abundant goodness are engra∣ven)
hath in many minds excited a very
high degree of reverence and good af∣fection
toward God: the devoutest per∣sons
(the holy <HI>Psalmists</HI> particularly)
we may observe frequent in this practice▪
enflaming their hearts with love,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 8. 19. 145. 104. 147.</NOTE> and
elevating them in reverence toward God
by surveying the common works of God
by viewing and considering the magnifi∣cent
vastness and variety, the goodly or∣der
and beauty, the constant duration
and stability of those things we see; in
remarking the general bounty and mu∣nificence
with which this great <HI>pater-familias</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>
hath provided for the necessary
sustenance, for the convenience, for the
defence, for the relief, for the delight and
satisfaction of his creatures: even in the
contemplation of these things being ra∣vished
with admiration and affection,
how often do they thus exclaim:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 33. 5. 119. 64. 145. 10. 147. 4. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>O Lord
how manifold are thy works, in wisedom
hast thou made them all. The earth is
full of the goodness of the Lord; the earth
O Lord is full of thy mercy! Great is our
Lord, and of great power; his understan∣ding
is infinite; All thy works shall praise
thee, O Lord;</HI> With such reflections, I
say, upon those common, yet admirable,
and excellent works of God (which we
perhaps with a regardless eye unprofi∣tably
pass over) did those good men
kindle, and foment pious affections to∣ward
God. The same effect may also the
considering the very common proceedings
of divine providence beget in us; such
as are discernible to every attentive mind
both from history and daily experience;
considering God's admirable condescen∣sion
in regarding and ordering humane
affairs both for common benefit and for
relief of particular necessities, his supply∣ing
the general needs of men, relieving
the poor, succouring the weak and help∣less,
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>
protecting and vindicating the op∣pressed,
his seasonable encouraging and
rewarding the good, restraining and
chastising the bad: Even such observa∣tions
are productive of love to God in
those, who, according to that duty in¦timated
by the Prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 5. 12.</NOTE> <HI>do regard th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
works of the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 28. 5. 107. 43. 64. 9. 111. 2. 77. 11. 143. 5.</NOTE> <HI>and consider the ope¦rations
of his hands; They who are wise
and will observe these things, they</HI> (a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Psalmist tells) <HI>shall understand th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
loving kindness of the Lord;</HI> understand
it practically, so as to be duly affected
thereby; and so accordingly we find
the consideration of these things applied
by the great guides and patterns of our
devotion. But especially the study and
contemplation of those more high and
rare proceedings of God, in managing
his gracious design of our Redemption
from sin and misery, wherein a wise∣dom
so unsearchable and a goodness so
astonishing declare themselves, are most
proper and effectual means of begetting
divine love: if the consideration of God's
eternal care for our welfare, of his de∣scending
to the lowest condition for our
sake, of his willingly undertaking and
patiently undergoing all kinds of incon∣venience,
of disgrace, of bitter pain and
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>
sorrow for us; of his freely offering us
mercy, and earnestly wooing us to re∣ceive
it, even when offenders, when ene∣mies,
when rebels against him; of his
bearing with exceeding patience all our
neglects of him, all our injuries towards
him; of his preparing a treasure of per∣fect
and endless bliss, and using all means
possible to bring us unto the possession
thereof; if, I say, considering those won∣derfull
streins of goodness will not affect
us, what can do it? How miserably cold
and damp must our affections be, if all
those powerfull rays (so full of heavenly
light and heat) shining through our minds
cannot enflame them? how desperately
hard and tough must our hearts be, if such
incentives cannot soften and melt them?
is it not an apathy more than Stoical,
more than stony, which can stand immo∣vable
before so mighty inducements to
passion? is it not a horridly prodigious
insensibility to think upon such expres∣sions
of kindness without feeling affec∣tion
reciprocal? But if the consideration
of God's general and publick beneficence
will not touch us sufficiently; let us far∣ther
hereto adjoin</P>
<P>3. Serious reflections upon the pecu∣liar
(personal or private) benefits by the
<PB N="54" REF="31"/>
divine goodness vouchsafed unto our
selves. There is, I suppose, scarce any
man, who may not, if he be not very
stupid and regardless, have observed (be∣side
the common effects of God's univer∣sal
care and bounty wherein he partakes)
even some particular expressions and te∣stimonies
of divine favour dispensed un∣to
him by God's hand (apt to convince
him of God's especial providence, care
and good-will to him particularly, and
thereby to draw him unto God) both
in relation to his temporal and to his
spiritual state; in preventing and preser∣ving
him from mischiefs imminent, in
opportune relief, when he was pressed
with want, or surprised by danger; in
directing him to good and diverting him
from evil. Every mans experience (I say
and suppose) will inform him that he
hath received many such benefits from
a hand, invisible indeed to sense, yet
easily discernible, if he do attend to
the circumstances wherein, to the sea∣sons
when they come: it is natural to
every man being in distress (from which
he cannot by any present or visible
means extricate himself) to stretch forth
his hand and lift up his voice toward
heaven, making his recourse to divine
<PB N="55" REF="31"/>
help; and it is as natural for God to re∣gard
the needs, to hearken to the crys,
to satisfie the desires of such persons (for,
<HI>The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 145. 16, 18. 107. 8. 34. 6, 10. 9. 9.</NOTE>
<HI>he openeth his hand, and satisfieth the de∣sire
of every living thing: He will be a
refuge to the oppressed, a refuge in times
of trouble: He satisfieth the longing soul,
and filleth the hungry soul with goodness:
They that seek the Lord, shall not want
any good thing:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 2. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Look at the generations
of old and see: did ever any trust in the
Lord and was forsaken? or whom did he
ever despise that called upon him? This
poor man</HI> (this, and that, any poor man)
<HI>cryed, and the Lord heard him, and sa∣ved
him out of all his troubles)</HI> since
then, no man in all likelihood hath not
some occasion of God's especial favour
and assistance, and God is always so
ready to afford them, we may reaso∣nably
presume that every man doth
sometime receive them, and is thereby
obliged to return a gratefull affection to
him, not onely as to a common bene∣factour,
but as to his particular friend and
patron. However there is none of us,
who may not perceive himself singular∣ly
indebted to God's patience in forbea∣ring
to punish him, to his mercy in par∣doning
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>
and passing over innumerable of∣fences
committed against him: the re∣nowned
Penitent in the Gospel did <HI>love
much,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 7. 47.</NOTE> <HI>because much was forgiven her;</HI>
And who is there of us, that hath not
the same reason to love much? who is
there that, at least according to God's
inclination and intention, hath not had
much forgiven him? whom have not
<HI>the riches of divine goodness and long-suffe∣ring
attended</HI> upon <HI>in order to his repen∣tance?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2. 4.</NOTE>
who hath not been in so great
degree ingratefull, unfruitfull and im∣profitable,
that he hath not abundant
reason to acknowledge God's especial
grace in bearing with him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 17. 10.</NOTE> and to con∣fess
with <HI>Jacob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 130. 3.</NOTE> that he is <HI>lesse than the
least of all God's mercies?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 32. 10.</NOTE> if any such
there were, he should have no less cause
to be affected with the abundance of
that grace, which so preserved him from
sins and provocations. For if we stand,
it is he that <HI>upholdeth us;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 37. 23. 246. 8.</NOTE> if we fall, it
is he that <HI>raiseth us;</HI> it is his especial
favour that either we avoid sin, or sin∣ning
escape punishment. Now then God
having by many real evidences declared
such particular affection toward us, can
we considering thereon do otherwise
than say to our selves, after Saint <HI>John,
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>
Nos ergò diligamus Deum, quoniam prior
dilexit nos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 4. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Let us therefore love God,
because God first loved us;</HI> surely in all
ingenuity, according to all equity, we
are bound to do so; the reason and na∣ture
of things doth require it of us: all
other loves (even those of the baser sort)
are able to propagate themselves;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Soph.</NOTE> (to con∣tinue
and enlarge their kind) are com∣monly
fruitfull, and effectual in producing
their like; how strangely then unnatural
and monstrous is it, that this love onely
(this so vigorous and perfect love) should
be barren and impotent as it were? <HI>If you
love those that love you</HI> (saith our Saviour)
<HI>what reward have you?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 46.</NOTE> (what reward can
you pretend to for so common, so necessa∣ry
a performance) <HI>do not even the publicans
doe the same?</HI> (the Publicans, men not
usually of the best natures, or tenderest
hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 6. 32.</NOTE> yet they do thus) And (again saith
he) <HI>If you love those who love you, what
thank is it, for even sinners love those that
love them?</HI> (sinners, men not led by con∣science
of duty, or regard to reason, but
hurried, with a kind of blind and violent
force, by instinct of nature, do so much,
go so far) If thus men, both by nature and
custom most untractable, the least gui∣ded
by rules of right, of reason, of inge∣nuity;
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>
yea not onely the most barbarous
men, but even the most savage beasts are
sensible of courtesies, return a kind of
affection unto them who make much of
them and do them good, what temper
are we of, if all that bounty we expe∣rience
cannot move us; if God's daily
<HI>loading us with his benefits,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 68. 19. 103. 14.</NOTE> if his <HI>crow∣ning
us with loving-kindness and tender
mercies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 34. 26.</NOTE> if all those <HI>showres of blessings,</HI>
which he continually poureth down
upon our heads doth not produce some
good degree of correspondent affection
in us? It cannot surely proceed altoge∣ther
from a wretched baseness of dispo∣sition,
that we are so cold and indiffe∣rent
in our affection toward God, or are
sometimes so averse from loving him;
it must rather in great part come from
our not observing carefully, not frequent∣ly
calling to mind, not earnestly consi∣dering
what God hath done for us, how
exceedingly we stand obliged to his
goodness, from our following that unto∣ward
generation of men, who were not
('tis said) <HI>mindfull of the wonders which
God did among them;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 9. 17.</NOTE> <HI>who remembred
not his hand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 78. 10, 42.</NOTE> <HI>nor the day that he delive∣red
them;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 5. 29. 29. 4.</NOTE> rather following. I say, such
careless and <HI>heartless people</HI> (so they are
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>
termed) than imitating that excellent
Person's discretion, who constantly did
<HI>set God's loving-kindness before his eyes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 26. 3.</NOTE>
who frequently did thus raise his mind
and rouse up his affections;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 103.</NOTE> <HI>Bless the
Lord, O my soul, and all that is within
me bless his holy name; Bless the Lord,
O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
who forgiveth all thine iniquities and
healeth all thy diseases,</HI> &amp;c. It is not for
want of the like experience, or the like
obligation, but for want of the same
wisedom, of the same care, of the same
honest consideration and diligence, that
we do not the like.</P>
<P>To these means I add that,</P>
<P>4. A special help to breed in us this
holy disposition of soul will be the set∣ting
our selves in good earnest, with a
strong and constant resolution, to endea∣vour
the performance of all our duty to∣ward
God, and keeping his command∣ments
although upon inferiour considera∣tions
of reason, such as we are capable
of applying to this purpose; regards of
fear, of hope, of desire to avoid the mis∣chiefs
arising from sin, or attaining the
benefits ensuing upon vertue. If we
cannot immediately raise our hearts to
that higher pitch of acting from that
<PB N="60" REF="34"/>
nobler principle of love, let us however
apply that we can reach unto practice,
striving as we are able to perform what
God requires of us; exercising our selves
as to material acts, in keeping a consci∣ence
void of offence toward God and to∣ward
man; the doing which as it may
in time discover the excellency of good∣ness
to our mind, so it will by degrees
reconcile our affections thereto; then
by God's blessing (who graciously re∣gards
the meanest endeavours toward
good;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 42. 1.</NOTE> who <HI>despiseth not the day of small
things;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zech. 4. 10.</NOTE> who will <HI>not quench the smoaking
flax nor break the bruised reed)</HI> from
doing good out of a sober regard to our
own welfare, we shall come to like it in
it self, and consequently to love him, un∣to
whose nature and to whose will it
renders us conformable: for as doing ill
breeds a dislike to goodness, and an aver∣sion
from him, who himself is full
thereof, and who rigorously exacts it of
us; as bad conscience removes expecta∣tion
of good from God, and begets a sus∣picion
of evil from him, consequently
stifling all kindness toward him; so do∣ing
well, we shall become acquainted
with it, and friends thereto; a hearty
approbation, esteem and good liking
<PB N="61" REF="34"/>
thereof will ensue; finding by experience,
that indeed the ways of wisedom, ver∣tue,
and piety are pleasantness, and all
her paths are peace; that the fruits of
conscientious practice are health to our
body, and to our soul, security to our
estate, and to our reputation, rest in our
mind, and comfort in our conscience;
goodness will become pretious in our
eyes, and he who commends it to us,
being himself essential goodness, will ap∣pear
most venerable and most amiable,
we shall then become disposed to render
him, what we perceive he best deserves,
entire reverence and affection.</P>
<P>5. But I commend farther, as a most
necessary mean of attaining this disposi∣tion,
assiduous earnest prayer unto God,
that he would in mercy bestow it on us,
and by his grace work it in us: which
practice is indeed doubly conducible to
this purpose; both in way of impetrati∣on,
and by real efficacy; it will not fail
to obtain it as a gift from God; it will
help to produce it as an instrument of
God's grace.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>first</HI> accompt it is absolutely
necessary; for it is from God's free re∣presentation
of himself as lovely to our
minds, and drawing our hearts unto him
<PB N="62" REF="35"/>
(although ordinarily in the use of the
means already mentioned, or some like
to them) that this affection is kindled;
our bare consideration is too cold, our
rational discourse too faint; we can∣not
sufficiently recollect our wandring
thoughts, we cannot strongly enough
impress those proper incentives of love
upon our hearts (our hearts so dampt
with sensual desires, so clogg'd and pe∣ster'd
with earthly inclinations) so as to
kindle in our souls this holy flame; it
can onely be effected by a light shining
from God, by a fire coming from heaven:
As all others, so more especially this
Queen of graces must proceed from the
father of lights, and giver of all good
gifts: he alone, who is love, can be the
parent of so goodly an off-spring, can
beget this lively image of himself within
us:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 22.</NOTE> it is the principal <HI>fruit of God's
Holy Spirit,</HI> nor can it grow from any
other root than from it; it is called the
<HI>love of the Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 30.</NOTE> as its most signal and
peculiar effect; in fine, <HI>the love of God</HI>
(as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> expresly teaches us) <HI>is
shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
Spirit given unto us;</HI> given, but that
not without asking, without seeking; a
grace so excellent, God, we may be as∣sured,
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>
will not dispense, a gift so preti∣ous
he will not bestow on them, who
do not care to look after it, who will
not vouchsafe to beg it: if we are not
willing to acknowledge our want there∣of;
if we refuse to express our desire of
it, if we will not shew that we regard
and value it, if, when God freely offers
it, and invites us to receive it (he doth
so by offering his holy Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 11. 9, 13.</NOTE> the foun∣tain
thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 21. 22. 7. 7.</NOTE> unto us) we will not de∣cently
apply our selves to him for it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 28. 9.</NOTE>
how can we expect to obtain it? God
hath propounded this condition (and 'tis
surely no hard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 15. 2.</NOTE> no grievous condition)
<HI>if we ask we shall receive;</HI> he hath ex∣presly
promised that <HI>He will give his
Spirit</HI> (his Spirit of love) <HI>to them who
ask it;</HI> we may be therefore sure, per∣forming
the condition duly, to obtain it;
and as sure, neglecting that, we deserve
to go without it.</P>
<P>Prayer then is upon this accompt a
needfull means; and it is a very pro∣fitable
one upon the score of its own
immediate energy or vertue: for as by
familiar converse (together with the de∣lights
and advantages attending thereon)
other friendships are begot and nourish∣ed,
so even by that acquaintance, as it
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>
were, with God, which devotion begets,
by experience therein how sweet and
good he is, this affection is produced
and strengthened.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> As want of enter∣course
weakens and dissolves friendship;
so if we seldom come at God, or little
converse with him, it is not onely a sign,
but will be a cause of estrangement and
disaffection toward him: according to the
nature of the thing, prayer hath peculiar
advantages above other acts of piety, to
this effect: therein not onely as in con∣templation
the eye of our mind (our in∣tellectual
part) is directed toward God:
but our affections also (the hand of our
soul by which we embrace good, the
feet thereof by which we pursue it) are
drawn out and fixed upon him; we no<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
onely therein behold his excellencies▪
but in a manner feel them and enjoy
them; our hearts also being thereby
softned and warmed by desire become
more susceptive of love. We do in the
performance of this duty approach nea∣rer
to God, and consequently God draws
nearer to us (as Saint <HI>James</HI> assures;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 4. 8.</NOTE>
<HI>Draw near,</HI> saith he, <HI>unto God, and he
will draw near to you)</HI> and thereby we
partake more fully and strongly of his
gracious influences; therein indeed he
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>
most freely communicates his grace,
therein he makes us most sensible of his
love to us, and thereby disposeth us to
love him again. I add, that true (fer∣vent
and hearty) prayer doth include,
and suppose▪ some acts of love, or some
near tendencies thereto; whence, as eve∣ry
habit is corroborated by acts of its
kind, so by this practice divine love will
be confirmed and increased. These are
the means, which my meditation did
suggest as conducing to the production
and growth of this most excellent grace
in our souls.</P>
<P>III. I should lastly propound some In∣ducements
apt to stir us up to the endea∣vour
of procuring it, and to the exercise
thereof, by representing to your conside∣ration
the blessed fruits and benefits (both
by way of natural causality and of re∣ward)
accruing from it; as also the wo∣full
consequences and mischiefs springing
from the want thereof. How being en∣dewed
with it perfects and advances our
nature, rendring it in a manner and de∣gree
divine, by resemblance to God (who
is full thereof, so full that he is called
Love) by approximation, adherence and
union (in a sort) unto him: how it
<PB N="66" REF="37"/>
ennobles us with the most glorious alli∣ance
possible, rendring us the friends and
favourites of the Sovereign King and Lord
of all, brethren of the first-born, whose
names are written in heaven; enriches
us with a right and title to the most in∣estimable
treasures (those which <HI>eye hath
not seen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 2. 9.</NOTE> <HI>nor ear heard, nor have entred
into the heart of man to conceive, which
God hath prepared for them that love
him)</HI> a sure possession of the supreme
good, of all that God is able to bestow,
all whose wisedom and power, whose
counsel and care it eternally engageth
for our benefit; how all security and
welfare, all rest and peace, all joy and
happiness attend upon it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 145. 20.</NOTE> for that <HI>The
Lord preserveth all them that love him</HI>
(preserveth them in the enjoyment of all
good, in safety from all danger and mis∣chief)
and that <HI>to those who love God all
things co-operate for their good;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 28.</NOTE> how in∣comparable
a sweetness and delight ac∣company
the practice thereof, far sur∣passing
all other pleasures; perfectly able
to content our minds, to sustain and com∣fort
us even in the want of all other sa∣tisfactions,
yea under the pressure of
whatever most grievous afflictions can
befall us. How contrariwise the want
<PB N="67" REF="37"/>
thereof will depress us into a state of
greatest imperfection and baseness, setting
us at the greatest distance from God in
all respects, both in similitude of nature,
and as to all favourable regard, or bene∣ficial
communication from him; casting
us into a wretched and disgracefull con∣sortship
with the most degenerate crea∣tures,
the accursed fiends, who for dis∣affection
and enmity toward God, are
banished from all happiness; how it ex∣treamly
impoverisheth and beggereth us,
devesting us of all right to any good
thing, rendring us incapable of any por∣tion,
but that of utter darkness; how it
excludeth us from any safety, any rest,
any true comfort or joy, and exposeth
us to all mischief and misery imaginable;
all that being deprived of the divine pro∣tection,
presence and favour, being made
objects of the divine anger, hatred and
severe justice, being abandoned to the
malice of hell, being driven into utter
darkness and eternal fire doth import or
can produce. I should also have com∣mended
this love to you by comparing
it with other loves, and shewing how far
in its nature, in its causes, in its proper∣ties,
in its effects it excelleth them;
even so far as the object thereof in ex∣cellency
<PB N="68" REF="38"/>
doth transcend all other objects
of our affection; how this is grounded
upon the highest and surest reason;
others upon accounts very low and
mean, commonly upon fond humour
and mistake; this produceth real, cer∣tain,
immutable goods; others at best
terminate onely in goods apparent, un∣stable
and transitory; this is most wor∣thy
of us, employing all our faculties in
their noblest manner of operation upon
the best object; others misbeseem us,
so that in pursuing them we disgrace
our understanding, misapply our desires,
distemper our affections, mispend our
endeavours. I should have enlarged up∣on
these considerations; and should have
adjoined some particular advantages of
this grace; as for instance, that the pro∣curing
thereof is the most sure, the most
easie, the most compendious way of at∣taining
all others; of sweetning and in∣gratiating
all obedience to us, of making
the hardest yoke easie, and the heaviest
burthen light unto us. In fine, I should
have wished you to consider, that its
practice is not onely a mean and way
to happiness, but our very formal hap∣piness
it self; the real enjoyment of the
best good we are capable of; that in
<PB N="69" REF="38"/>
which alone heaven it self (the felicity
of Saints and Angels) doth consist; which
more then comprehends in it self all the
benefits of highest dignity, richest plen∣ty
and sweetest pleasure. But I shall
forbear entring upon so ample and fruit∣full
subjects of meditation, and conclude
with that good Collect of our Church:</P>
<P>O Lord, who hast prepared for them
that love thee such good things as pass
man's understanding; pour into our hearts
such love toward thee, that we, loving
thee above all things, may obtain thy pro∣mises,
which exceed all that we can desire;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<Q>And the Second is like unto it, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thy self.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE essential goodness of God,
and his special benignity toward
mankind are to a considering
mind divers ways very apparent; the
frame of the world, and the natural
course of things do with a thousand voi∣ces
loudly and clearly proclaim them to
us; every sense doth yield us <HI>affidavit</HI>
to that speech of the Holy Psalmist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 33. 5. 119. 64.</NOTE> <HI>The
earth is full of the goodness of the Lord:</HI>
we see it in the glorious brightness of the
skies, and in the pleasant verdure of the

we smell it in the fragrancies of herbs
and flowers; we hear it in the natural
musick of the woods; we feel it in the
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>
comfortable warmth of heaven, and in
the cheering freshness of the air; we
continually do possess and enjoy it in the
numberless accommodations of life, pre∣sented
to us by the bountifull hand of
nature.</P>
<P>Of the same goodness we may be well
assured by that common providence
which continually doth uphold us in
our being, doth opportunely relieve our
needs, doth protect us in dangers, and
rescue us from imminent mischiefs, doth

the which (in the divine

<HI>and suffereth not our feet to be moved;</HI>
doth <HI>redeem our life from destruction;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 103. 4. 145. 16.</NOTE>
doth <HI>crown us with loving-kindness, and

<P>The dispensations of grace, in the re∣velation
of heavenly truth, in the over∣tures
of mercy, in the succours of our
weakness, in the proposal of glorious re∣wards,
in all the methods and means
conducing to our salvation, do afford
most admirable proofs and pledges of
the same immense benignity.</P>
<P>But in nothing is the divine goodness
toward us more illustriously conspicu∣ous,
than in the nature and tendency of
<PB N="73" REF="40"/>
those Laws which God hath been plea∣sed
for the regulation of our lives to pre∣scribe
unto us, all which do palpably
evidence his serious desire and provident
care of our welfare; so that in impo∣sing
them he plainly doth not so much
exercise his Sovereignty over us, as ex∣press
his kindness toward us; neither
do they more clearly declare his will,
than demonstrate his good-will to us.</P>
<P>And among all divine Precepts this
especially contained in my Text, doth
argue the wonderfull goodness of our
heavenly Law-giver, appearing both in
the manner of the proposal, and in the
substance of it.</P>
<P><HI>The Second,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 10. 27.</NOTE> saith our Lord, <HI>is like
to it,</HI> that is to the Precept of <HI>loving
the Lord our God with all our heart:</HI>
and is not this a mighty argument of
immense goodness in God, that he doth
in such a manner commend this duty to
us, coupling it with our main duty to∣ward
him, and requiring us with like
earnestness to love our neighbour as to
love himself?</P>
<P>He is transcendently amiable for the
excellency of his nature; he by innu∣merable
and inestimable benefits graci∣ously
conferred on us hath deserved our
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
utmost affection; so that naturally there
can be no obligation bearing any pro∣portion
or considerable semblance to
that of loving him; yet hath he in good∣ness
been pleased to create one, and to
endew it with that privilege; making
the love of a man (whom we cannot
value but for <HI>his</HI> gifts, to whom we can
owe nothing but what properly we owe
to <HI>him)</HI> no less obligatory, to declare
it near as acceptable as the love of him∣self,
to whom we owe all. To him, as
the sole authour and free donour of all
our good, by just correspondence all our
mind and heart, all our strength and en∣deavour
are due; and reasonably might
he engross them to himself, excluding all
other beings from any share in them;
so that we might be obliged onely to
fix our thoughts and set our affections
on him, onely to act directly for his ho∣nour
and interest; saying with the Ho∣ly
Psalmist,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 73. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Whom have I in heaven but
thee? and there is none in earth that I
desire beside thee:</HI> Yet doth he freely
please to impart a share of these perfor∣mances
on mankind; yet doth he charge
us to place our affection on one another;
to place it there indeed in a measure so
large that we can hardly imagine a grea∣ter;
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>
according to a rule, than which
none can be devised more compleat or
certain.</P>
<P>O marvellous condescension, O good∣ness
truly divine; which surpasseth the
nature of things, which dispenseth with
the highest right, and forgoeth the grea∣test
interest that can be! Doth not God
in a sort debase himself, that he might
advance us? doth he not appear to wave
his own due, and neglect his own honour
for our advantage? how otherwise could
the love of man be capable of any re∣semblance
to the love of God, and not
stand at an infinite distance, or in an
extream disparity from it? how other∣wise
could we be obliged to affect or re∣gard
any thing beside the Sovereign, the
onely goodness? how otherwise could
there be any <HI>second</HI> or like to <HI>that first,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 19. 17.</NOTE>
<HI>that great,</HI> that peerless command, <HI>Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 22. 38.</NOTE></P>
<P>This indeed is the highest commenda∣tion
whereof any Law is capable; for as
to be like God is the highest praise that
can be given to a person; so to resemble
the divinest Law of love to God is the
fairest character that can be assigned of
a Law: the which indeed representeth

as the top and crown of them; and
<HI>Above all things</HI> (saith he) <HI>have fervent
charity among your selves.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 8.</NOTE> Saint <HI>John</HI>
calleth this Law, in way of excellence,
<HI>the commandment of God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3. 23, 11. 4. 21.</NOTE> and our Lord
himself claimeth it as his peculiar Pre∣cept,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 15. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>This</HI> (saith he) <HI>is my commandment,
that ye love one another as I have loved
you;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 13. 34.</NOTE> <HI>A new commandment I give unto
you, that ye love one another;</HI> and ma∣keth
the observance of it the special
cognizance of his followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 13. 35.</NOTE> <HI>By this shall
<PB N="77" REF="42"/>
all men know that ye are my disciples, if
ye love one another.</HI></P>
<P>These indeed are lofty commendati∣ons
thereof, yet all of them may wor∣thily
veil to this; all of them seem veri∣fied
in virtue of this, because God hath
vouchsafed to place this command in so
near adjacency to the first great Law,
conjoining the two Tables; making
Charity contiguous, and as it were com∣mensurate
to Piety.</P>
<P>It is true, that in many respects Cha∣rity
doth resemble Piety; for it is the
most genuine daughter of Piety, thence
in complexion, in features, in humour
much favouring its sweet mother; It
doth consist in like dispositions and mo∣tions
of soul; It doth grow from the
same roots and principles of benignity,
ingenuity, equity, gratitude, planted in
our original constitution by the breath
of God, and improved in our hearts by
the divine <HI>Spirit of love;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 4. 7, 11.</NOTE> It produceth
the like fruits of beneficence toward
others, and of comfort in our selves; It
in like manner doth assimilate us to God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 45.</NOTE>
rendring us conformable to his nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 1, 2.</NOTE>
followers of his practice and partakers
of his felicity; It is of like use and con∣sequence
toward the regulation of our
<PB N="78" REF="43"/>
practice, and due management of our
whole life: In such respects I say this
Law is like to the other; but it is how∣ever
chiefly so for that God hath pleased
to lay so great stress thereon, as to make
it the other half of our Religion and
duty; or because, as Saint <HI>John</HI> saith,
<HI>This commandment have we from him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 22. 40.</NOTE>
<HI>that he who loveth God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 4. 21.</NOTE> <HI>love his brother
also;</HI> which is to his praise a most preg∣nant
demonstration of his immense good∣ness
toward us.</P>
<P>But no less in the very substance of
this Duty will the benignity of him that
prescribeth it shine forth, displaying it
self in the rare beauty and sweetness of
it; together with the vast benefit and
utility, which it, being observed, will
yield to mankind; which will appear
by what we may discourse for pressing
its observance; but first let us explain
it, as it lyeth before us expressed in the
words of the Text, wherein we shall
consider <HI>two</HI> Particulars observable;
<HI>First,</HI> The Object of the Duty; <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
The Qualification annexed to
it; The Object of it, <HI>Our Neighbour,</HI>
The Qualification, <HI>As our selves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="43"/>
I. The <HI>Object</HI> of Charity is <HI>our Neigh∣bour;</HI>
that is (it being understood, as
the Precept now concerneth us, accor∣ding
to our Lord's exposition, or accor∣ding
to his intent, and the tenour of his
Doctrine) every man, with whom we
have to doe, or who is capable of our
love, especially every Christian.</P>
<P>The Law as it was given to God's an∣cient
people did openly regard onely
those among them, who were linked
together in a holy neighbourhood or So∣ciety,
from which all other men being
excluded were deemed strangers and fo∣reiners;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>(aliens,</HI> as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh,
<HI>from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of promise.)</HI>
for thus the Law runneth in <HI>Leviticus,
Thou shalt not bear any grudge against
the children of thy people,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. 19. 18.</NOTE> <HI>but thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thy self;</HI> where
plainly <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Neighbours</HI> are terms
equivalent; other men being supposed
to stand at distance without the fold or
politick enclosure, which God by seve∣ral
Ordinances had fenced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. 20. 26, 24.</NOTE> to keep that
Nation unmixt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 33. 16.</NOTE> and separate: nor can
it be excepted against this notion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 7. 6. 14. 2.</NOTE> that
in the same Chapter it is enjoined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. 19. 34.</NOTE> <HI>But
the stranger that dwelleth with you shall
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>
be unto you as one born among you, and
thou shalt love him as thy self;</HI> for by
that stranger (as the <HI>Jewish</HI> Masters well
interpret it) is meant <HI>a Proselyte of righ∣teousness;</HI>
or one who although a stran∣ger
by birth, was yet a brother in Re∣ligion,
having voluntarily submitted to
their Law, being engaged in the same
Covenant, and thence admitted to the
same Privileges, as an adopted Child of
that Holy Family.</P>
<P>But now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 14.</NOTE> such distinctions of men be∣ing
voided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 28.</NOTE> and that <HI>wall of partition</HI> de∣molished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 10. 36.</NOTE>
all the world is become one
people; subject to the Laws of one com∣mon
Lord; and capable of the mercies
purchased by one Redeemer. God's
love to mankind did move him to send
our Lord into the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3. 4.</NOTE> to assume hu∣mane
nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 3. 16.</NOTE> and therein to become a
Mediatour between God and Men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 5.</NOTE> Our
Lord's kindness to all his brethren dis∣posed
him to undertake their salvation,
and to expiate their sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 2. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>to taste
death for every man;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 2. 9.</NOTE> the effect whereof
is an universal reconciliation of God to
the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 19.</NOTE> and an union of men together.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now the bloud of Christ hath cemen∣ted
mankind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 1. 10.</NOTE> the favour of God embra∣cing
all hath approximated and combined
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>
all together;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 13.</NOTE> so that now every man is
our brother, not onely by nature, as de∣rived
from the same stock, but by grace,
as partaker of the common redemption;
Now God <HI>desiring the salvation of all
men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 4.</NOTE> and inviting all men to mercy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 2. 11.</NOTE>
our duty must be coextended with God's
grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 23.</NOTE> and our charity must follow that
of our Saviour.</P>
<P>We are therefore now to all men, that
which one <HI>Jew</HI> was to another; yea
more than such, our Christianity having
induced much higher obligations, stricter
alliances and stronger endearments, than
were those, whereby <HI>Judaism</HI> did en∣gage
its followers to mutual amity. The
duties of common humanity, (to which
our natural frame and sense do incline
us, which Philosophy recommendeth
and natural Religion doth prescribe, be∣ing
grounded upon our community of
nature and cognation of bloud, upon
apparent equity, upon general conveni∣ence
and utility) our Religion doth not
onely enforce and confirm, but enhance
and improve; superadding higher instan∣ces
and faster tyes of spiritual relation,
reaching in a sort to all men (as being
in duty, in design, in remote capacity
our spiritual brethren) but in especial
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>
manner to all Christians, who actually
are fellow members of the same holy
fraternity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1. 23. 2. 17.</NOTE> contracted by spiritual rege∣neration
from one heavenly seed, sup∣ported
by a common faith and hope,
strengthened by communion in acts of
devotion and charity.</P>
<P><HI>Hereon therefore are grounded those
Evangelical commands, explicatory of
this Law as it now standeth in force;
that</HI> as we have opportunity we should do
good unto all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 10.</NOTE> especially unto them
who are of the houshold of faith; <HI>that</HI>
we should abound in love one toward ano∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 3. 12.</NOTE>
and towards all men; <HI>that we</HI>
should glorifie God in our professed sub∣jection
unto the Gospel of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 9. 12, 13.</NOTE> by li∣berally
distributing to the Saints, and to
all men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 24.</NOTE> <HI>that we should</HI> follow peace
with all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 14.</NOTE> <HI>should</HI> be patient toward
all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3. 2.</NOTE> <HI>and</HI> gentle toward all men, <HI>and</HI>
shew all meekness toward all men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 15.</NOTE> <HI>and</HI>
ever follow that which is good both among
our selves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> and to all men; <HI>that we
should</HI> make supplications,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 24.</NOTE> intercessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 1.</NOTE>
and thanksgivings for all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 6. 18.</NOTE> <HI>especially
for</HI> all Saints, <HI>or all our fellow-Christi∣ans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>and</HI> express moderation, <HI>or ingenui∣ty,</HI>
to all men.</P>
<P>Such is the Object of our Charity;
<PB N="83" REF="45"/>
and thus did our Lord himself expound
it, when by a <HI>Jewish</HI> Lawyer being put
to resolve this question,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 10. 29. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. Just. M. <HI>c. Tryph. (p. 320.)</HI></NOTE> <HI>And who is my
neighbour?</HI> he did propound a case, or
history, whereby he did extort from
that <HI>Rabbi</HI> this confession, that even a
<HI>Samaritan,</HI> discharging a notable office
of humanity and mercy to a <HI>Jew,</HI> did
thereby most truly approve himself a
good neighbour to him; and consequent∣ly
that reciprocal performances of such
offices were due from a <HI>Jew</HI> to a <HI>Sama∣ritan;</HI>
whence it might appear, that
this relation of neighbourhood is univer∣sal
and unlimited. So much for the
<HI>Object.</HI></P>
<P>II. As for the <HI>Qualification</HI> annexed
and couched in those words, <HI>as thy self,</HI>
that, as I conceive, may import both a
<HI>Rule</HI> declaring the Nature, and a <HI>Mea∣sure</HI>
determining the Quantity of that
Love which is due from us to our neigh∣bour;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Arist. <HI>Eph.</HI> 9. 4.</NOTE>
the comparative term <HI>As</HI> imply∣ing
both Conformity or Similitude, and
Commensuration or Equality.</P>
<P>1. Loving our neighbour <HI>as our selves</HI>
doth import a <HI>Rule</HI> directing what kind
of love we should bear and exercise to∣ward
him; or informing us that our
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>
charity doth consist in having the same
affections of soul, and in performing the
same acts of beneficence toward him, as
we are ready by inclination, as we are
wont in practice to have or to perform
toward our selves, with full approbati∣on
of our judgment and conscience,
apprehending it just and reasonable so
to doe.</P>
<P>We cannot indeed better understand
the nature of this duty, than by reflec∣ting
on the motions of our own heart,
and observing the course of our demea∣nour
toward our selves; for thence in∣fallibly
we may be assured how we
should stand affected, and how we
should behave our selves toward others.</P>
<P>This is a peculiar advantage of this
Rule (inferring the excellent wisedom
and goodness of him who framed it)
that by it very easily and certainly we
may discern all the specialties of our
duty,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> without looking abroad or having
recourse to external instruction; so that
by it we may be perfect Law-givers,
and skilfull Judges, and faithfull Moni∣tours
to our selves of what in any case
we should do: for every one by internal
experience knoweth what it is to love
himself, every one is conscious how he
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>
useth to treat himself; each one conse∣quently
can prescribe and decide for
himself, what he ought to doe toward
his neighbour; so that we are not onely
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 4. 9.</NOTE> <HI>taught of God,</HI> as the Apostle
saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 7. 12.</NOTE> <HI>to love one another,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 6. 31.</NOTE> but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
taught of our selves how to exercise
that duty; whence our Lord otherwhere
doth propose the Law of charity in these
terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Tob. 4. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Whatsoever ye would that men
should doe unto you, doe ye even so unto
them, for this is the law and the pro∣phets;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Const. Apost. 1. 1.</NOTE>
that is, unto this Rule all the
special precepts of charity proposed in
Holy Scripture, may be reduced.</P>
<P>Wherefore for information concerning
our duty in each case and circumstance,
we need onely thus to consult and in∣terrogate
our selves, hence forming re∣solutions
concerning our practice.</P>
<P>Do we not much esteem and set by
our selves, do we not strive to maintain
in our minds a good opinion of our
selves; can any mischances befalling us,
any defects observable in us, any faults
committed by us induce us to slight or
despise our selves? this may teach us
what regard and value we should ever
preserve for our neighbour.</P>
<P>Do we not sincerely and earnestly
<PB N="86" REF="47"/>
desire our own welfare and advantage
in every kind;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. Just. M. <HI>c. Tryph. (p. 321.)</HI></NOTE> do we not heartily wish
good success to our own designs and un∣dertakings;
are we unconcerned or cold∣ly
affected in any case touching our own
safety, our estate, our credit, our satis∣faction
or pleasure? do we not especial∣ly,
if we rightly understand our selves,
desire the health and happiness of our
souls? this doth inform us, what we
should wish and covet for our neigh∣bour.</P>
<P>Have we not a sensible delight and
complacency in our own prosperity?
do we ever repine at any advantages ac∣cruing
to our person or condition? are
we not extreamly glad to find our selves
thriving and flourishing in wealth, in
reputation, in any accommodation or
ornament of our state? especially if we
be sober and wise, doth not our spiritual
proficiency and improvement in vertue
yield joyous satisfaction to us? are we
not much comforted in apprehending
our selves to proceed in a hopefull way
toward everlasting felicity? this may
instruct us what content we should feel
in our neighbours prosperity, both tem∣poral
and spiritual.</P>
<P>Do we not seriously grieve at our own
<PB N="87" REF="47"/>
disasters and disappointments; are we
not in sad dumps, whenever we incur
any dammage or disgrace; do not our
diseases and pains sorely afflict us; do
we not pity and bemoan our selves in
any want, calamity, or distress? can we
especially, if we are our selves, without
grievous displeasure apprehend our selves
enslaved to Sin and Satan, destitute of
God's favour, exposed to endless misery?
hence may we learn how we should
condole and commiserate the misfortunes
of our neighbour.</P>
<P>Do we not eagerly prosecute our own
concerns? do we not with huge vigour
and industry strive to acquire all conve∣niencies
and comforts to our selves, to
rid our selves of all wants and molesta∣tions?
is our solicitous care or painfull
endeavour ever wanting toward the sup∣port
and succour of our selves in any of
our needs? are we satisfied in meerly
wishing our selves well, are we not also
busie and active in procuring what we
affect? especially, if we are well advised,
do we not effectually provide for the
weal of our soul, and supply of our spiri∣tual
necessities; labouring to rescue our
selves from ignorance and errour, from
the tyranny of sin, from the torture of
<PB N="88" REF="48"/>
a bad conscience, from the danger of
hell? this sheweth how ready we should
be really to further our neighbours good,
ministring to him all kinds of assistance
and relief sutable to his needs, both cor∣poral
and spiritual.</P>
<P>Are we so proud or nice, that we dis∣dain
to yield attendance or service need∣full
for our own sustenance or conveni∣ence;
do we not indeed gladly perform
the meanest and most sordid offices for
our selves? this declareth how conde∣scensive
we should be in helping our
neighbour, how ready even <HI>to wash his
feet,</HI> when occasion doth require.</P>
<P>Do we love to vex our selves, or cross
our own humour? do we not rather
seek by all means to please and gratifie
our selves? this may warn us, how in∣nocent
and inoffensive, how compliant
and complacent we should be in our
behaviour toward others; endeavouring
<HI>to please them in all things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 2.</NOTE> especially <HI>for
their good to edification.</HI></P>
<P>Are we easily angry with our selves,
do we retain implacable grudges against
our selves, or do we execute upon our
selves mischievous revenge? are we not
rather very meek and patient toward
our selves, mildly comporting with our
<PB N="89" REF="48"/>
own great weaknesses, our troublesome
humours, our impertinencies and follies;
readily forgiving our selves the most hei∣nous
offences, neglects, affronts, injuries,
and outrages committed by us against
our own interest, honour, and welfare?
hence may we derive lessons of meek∣ness
and patience, to be exercised to∣ward
our neighbour, in bearing his in∣firmities
and miscarriages, in remitting
any wrongs or discourtesies received from
him.</P>
<P>Are we apt to be rude in our deport∣ment,
harsh in our language, or rigorous
in our dealing toward our selves? do we
not rather in word and deed treat our
selves very softly, very indulgently?
Do we use to pry for faults, or to pick
quarrels with our selves, to carp at any
thing said or done by us, rashly or up∣on
slight grounds to charge blame on
our selves, to lay heavy censures on our
actions, to make foul constructions of our
words, to blazon our defects, or aggra∣vate
our failings? do we not rather con∣nive
at, and conceal our blemishes; do
we not excuse and extenuate our own
crimes?</P>
<P>Can we find in our hearts to frame
virulent invectives, or to dart bitter taunts
<PB N="90" REF="49"/>
and scoffs against our selves; to murther
our own credit by slander, to blast it by
detraction, to maim it by reproach, to
prostitute it to be deflowred by jeering
and scurrilous abuse? are we not rather
very jealous of our reputation, and stu∣dious
to preserve it, as a precious orna∣ment,
a main fence, an usefull instru∣ment
of our welfare?</P>
<P>Do we delight to report, or like to
hear ill stories of our selves? do we not
rather endeavour all we can to stifle
them; to tie the tongues and stop the
ears of men against them? hence may
we be acquainted how civil and courte∣ous
in our behaviour, How fair and in∣genuous
in our dealing, how candid and
mild in our judgment or censure we
should be toward our neigbour; how
very tender and carefull we should be
of any wise wronging or hurting his
fame.</P>
<P>Thus reflecting on our selves, and
making our practice toward our selves
the pattern of our dealing with others,
we shall not fail to discharge what is
prescribed to us in this Law; and so we
have here a <HI>Rule</HI> of Charity. But far∣ther,</P>
<P>2. Loving our neighbour as our selves
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>
doth also import the <HI>Measure</HI> of our love
toward him; that it should be commen∣surate
and equal in degree to that love,
which we bear and exercise toward our
selves. Saint <HI>Peter</HI> once and again doth
exhort us <HI>to love one another</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1. 22. 4. 8.</NOTE>
<HI>with an outstretched affection;</HI> and how
far that affection should be stretched we
are here informed; even that it should
reach the farthest that can be, or to a
parity with that intense love, which we
do bear in heart, and express in perfor∣mance
toward our selves: so that we do
either bring down our self-love to such a
moderation, or raise up our charity to
such a fervency, that both come to be
adjusted in the same even level: this is
that pitch, at which we should aim and
aspire; this is that perfection of charity,
which our Lord recommendeth to us
in that injunction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 48.</NOTE> <HI>Be perfect, even as
your father in heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P>That this sense of the words is inclu∣ded,
yea chiefly intended, divers reasons
will evince: For</P>
<P>1. The most natural signification and
common use of the phrase doth import
thus much; and any one at first hearing
would so understand the words.</P>
<P>2. It appeareth by comparing this
<PB N="92" REF="50"/>
Precept with that to which it is annexed,
<HI>of loving God with all our heart and all
our soul,</HI> which manifestly designeth the
quantity and degree of that love; con∣sequently
the like determination is in∣tended
in this Precept, which is expres∣sed
to resemble that, or designed in like
manner to qualifie and bound our duty
toward our neighbour.</P>
<P>3. If the Law doth not signifie thus
much, it doth hardly signifie any thing;
not at least any thing of direction or use
to us; for no man is ignorant that he is
obliged to love his neighbour, but how
far that love must extend, is the point
wherein most of us do need to be resol∣ved,
and without satisfaction in which
we shall hardly do any thing; for as he
that oweth money will not pay except
he can tell how much it is; so to know
the Duty will not avail toward effectual
observance of it, if its measure be not
fixed.</P>
<P>4. Indeed, the Law otherwise under∣stood
will rather be apt to misguide than
to direct us; inducing us to apprehend,
that we shall satisfie its intent, and suf∣ficiently
discharge our duty, by practi∣sing
charity in any low degree or mean
instance. Also,</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="50"/>
5. The former sense, which is unque∣stionable,
doth infer and establish this;
because similitude of love, morally spea∣king,
cannot consist with inequality
thereof; for if in considerable degrees we
love our selves more than others, assu∣redly
we shall fail both in exerting such
internal acts of affection, and in perfor∣ming
such external offices of kindness
toward them, as we do exert and per∣form
in regard to our selves; whence
this Law, taken meerly as a Rule, de∣manding
a confused and imperfect simi∣litude
of practice, will have no clear ob∣ligation
or certain efficacy.</P>
<P>6. But farther to assure this expositi∣on,
I shall declare that the Duty thus
interpreted is agreeable to reason, and
may justly be required of us, upon con∣siderations,
which together will serve to
press the observance of it, according to
such measure.</P>
<P>1. It is reasonable that we should thus
love our neighbour as our selves, because
he is as our selves, or really in all con∣siderable
respects the same with us: We
concur with him in all that is necessary,
substantial, and stable; we differ from
him onely in things contingent, circum∣stantial,
and variable; in the which, of
<PB N="94" REF="51"/>
course or by chance we are liable in a
small time as much to differ from our
selves: in such respects we are not the
same to day that we were yesterday,
and shall be to morrow; for we shift our
circumstances as we do our cloaths;
our bodies are in continual flux, and
our souls do much conform to their al∣teration;
our temper and complexion
do vary with our air, our diet, our con∣versation,
our fortunes, our age; our parts
grow and decay, our principles and judg∣ments,
our affections and desires are ne∣ver
fixed, and seldom rest long in the
same place; all our outward state doth
easily change face; so that if we consi∣der
the same person in youth and in
age, in health and in sickness, in pro∣sperity
and in distress, may we not say
<HI>quantùm mutatus ab illo,</HI> how quite ano∣ther
man is he grown? Yet shall a man
for such alterations surcease or abate his
love to himself? why then in regard to
the like differences shall we less affect
our neighbour, who is endowed with
that common nature, which alone
through all those vicissitudes sticketh
fast in us; who is the most express
image of us, (or rather a copy, drawn
by the same hand, of the same orginal)
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>
another self, attired in a divers garb of
circumstances? do we not so far as we
despise or disaffect him, by consequence
slight or hate our selves; seeing (except
bare personality, or I know not what
metaphysical identity) there is nothing
in him different from what is, or what
may be in us?</P>
<P>2. It is just that we should love our
neighbour equally with our selves, be∣cause
he really no less deserveth love, or
because upon a fair judgment he will
appear equally amiable: justice is impar∣tial,
and regardeth things as they are in
themselves, abstracting from their rela∣tion
to this or that person; whence if our
neighbour seem worthy of affection no
less than we, it demandeth that accor∣dingly
we should love him no less.</P>
<P>And what ground can there be of
loving our selves which may not as well
be found in others? is it endowments
of nature, is it accomplishments of know∣ledge,
is it ornaments of vertue, is it ac∣coustrements
of fortune; but is not our
neighbour possessed of the same; is he
not at least capable of them, the colla∣tion
and acquist of them depending on
the same arbitrary bounty of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4. 6, 5.</NOTE> or
upon faculties and means commonly dis∣pensed
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>
to all? May not any man at least
be as wise and as good as we? why then
should we not esteem, why not affect
him as much? doth relation to us alter
the case? is self as self lovely or valuable,
doth that respect lend any worth or price
to things?</P>
<P>Likewise, what more can justice find
in our neighbour to obstruct or depress
our love than it may observe in our
selves? hath he greater infirmities or de∣fects,
is he more liable to errours and
miscarriages, is he guilty of worse faults
than we? If without arrogance and vi∣nity
we cannot affirm this, then are we
as unworthy of love as he can be; an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
refusing any degree thereof to him, w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
may as reasonably withdraw the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from our selves.</P>
<P>3. It is fit that we should be obliged
to love our neighbour equally with ou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
selves, because all charity beneath self
love is defective, and all self-love abov<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
charity is excessive.</P>
<P>It is an imperfect charity which dote
not respect our neighbour according to
his utmost merit and worth, which dote
not heartily desire his good, which dote
not earnestly promote his advantage i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
every kind, according to our ability an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="97" REF="52"/>
opportunity: and what beyond this can
we do for our selves?</P>
<P>If in kind or degree we transcend this,
it is not vertuous love or true friendship
to our selves, but a vain fondness or per∣verse
dotage; proceeding from inordi∣nate
dispositions of soul, grounded on
foolish conceits, begetting foul qualities
and practises; envy, strife, ambition, ava∣rice,
and the like.</P>
<P>4. Equity requireth that we should
love our neighbour to this degree, be∣cause
we are apt to claime the same mea∣sure
of love from others: no mean re∣spect
or slight affection will satisfie us;
we cannot brook the least disregard or
coldness; to love us a little is all one to
us as not to love us at all: it is therefore
equitable that we should be engaged
to the same height of charity toward
others; otherwise we should be allowed
in our dealings to use double weights and
measures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 22.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> which is plain iniquity: what
indeed can be more ridiculously absurd,
than that we should pretend to receive
that from others, which we are not dis∣posed
to yield to them upon the same
ground and title?</P>
<P>5. It is needfull that so great a charity
should be prescribed, because none infe∣riour
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>
thereto will reach divers weighty
ends designed in this Law; namely, the
general convenience and comfort of our
lives in mutual society and entercourse:
for if in considerable degree we do af∣fect
our selves beyond others, we shall
be continually bickering and clashing
with them about points of interest and
credit; scrambling with them for what
may be had, and clambering to get over
them in power and dignity; whence all
the passions annoying our souls, and all
the mischiefs disturbing our lives must
needs ensue.</P>
<P>6. That entire love which we owe to
God our Creatour, and to Christ our Re∣deemer,
doth exact from us no less a
measure of Charity than this: for seeing
they have so clearly demonstrated them∣selves
to bear an immense love to men,
and have charged us therein to imitate
them; it becometh us in conformity, in
duty, in gratitude to them, to bear the
highest we can, that is the same as we
bear to our selves: for how can we love
God enough, or with all our soul, if we
do not accord with him in loving his
friends and relations, his servants, his
children with most entire affection?</P>
<P>If in God's judgment they are equal
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>
to us, if in his affection and care they
have an equal share, if he in all his dea∣lings
is indifferent and impartial toward
all, how can our judgment, our affecti∣on,
our behaviour be right, if they do
not conspire with him in the same mea∣sures?</P>
<P>7. Indeed the whole tenour and <HI>Ge∣nius</HI>
of our Religion do imply obligati∣on
to this pitch of charity, upon vari∣ous
accompts.</P>
<P>It representeth all worldly goods and
matters of private interest as very incon∣siderable
and unworthy of our affection,
thereby substracting the fuel of immode∣rate
self-love.</P>
<P>It enjoineth us for all our particular
concerns entirely to rely upon provi∣dence,
so barring solicitude for our selves,
and disposing an equal care for others.</P>
<P>It declareth every man so weak, so
vile, so wretched, so guilty of sin and
subject to misery (so for all good whol∣ly
indebted to the pure grace and mer∣cy
of God) that no man can have rea∣son
to dote on himself, or to prefer him∣self
before others: we need not cark, or
prog, or scrape for our selves, being as∣sured
that God sufficiently careth for
us.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="54"/>
In its accompt the fruits and recom∣pences
of love to others in advantage to
our selves do far surpass all present inte∣rests
and enjoyments; whence in effect
the more or less we love others, answe∣rably
the more or less we love our selves,
so that charity and self-love become co∣incident,
and both run together evenly
in one channel.</P>
<P>It recommendeth to us the imitation
of God's love and bounty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 45.</NOTE> which are ab∣solutely
pure, without any regard, any
capacity of benefit redounding to him∣self.</P>
<P>It commandeth us heartily to love even
our bitterest enemies and most cruel per∣secutours;
which cannot be performed
without a proportionable abatement of
self-love.</P>
<P>It chargeth us not onely freely to im∣part
our substance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3. 16.</NOTE> but willingly to expose
our lives for the good of our brethren;
in which case charity doth plainly match
self-love; for what hath a man more dear
or precious than his life to lay out for
himself.</P>
<P>It representeth all men (considering
their divine extraction, and being formed
after God's Image; their designation for
eternal glory and happiness, their parta∣king
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>
of the common redemption by the
undertakings and sufferings of Christ,
their being objects of God's tender affec∣tion
and care) so very considerable, that
no regard beneath the highest will befit
them.</P>
<P>It also declareth us so nearly allied to
them, and so greatly concerned in their
good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3. 28.</NOTE> (we being <HI>all one in Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 17. 21.</NOTE> and
<HI>members one of another)</HI> that we ought
to have a perfect complacency in their
welfare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 5.</NOTE> and a sympathy in their adver∣sity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12. 26.</NOTE>
as our own.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 13. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>It condemneth self-love, self-pleasing,
self-seeking as great faults,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 3. 2.</NOTE> which yet
(even in the highest excess) do not seem
absolutely bad;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 2. 10.</NOTE> or otherwise culpable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 1.</NOTE>
than as including partiality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 4.</NOTE> or detrac∣ting
from that equal measure of charity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 34. 13. 5.</NOTE>
which we owe to others: for surely we
cannot love our selves too much, if we
love others equally with our selves; we
cannot seek our own good excessively,
if with the same earnestness we seek the
good of others.</P>
<P>It exhibiteth supernatural aids of
grace, and conferreth that Holy Spirit
of love, which can serve to no meaner
purposes, than to quell that sorry prin∣ciple
of niggardly selfishness, to which
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>
corrupt nature doth incline; and to en∣large
our hearts to this divine extent of
goodness.</P>
<P>8. Lastly, many conspicuous exam∣ples,
proposed for our direction in this
kind of practice, do imply this degree
of charity to be required of us.</P>
<P>It may be objected to our discourse,
that the duty, thus understood, is un∣practicable,
nature violently swaying to
those degrees of self-love, which charity
can no wise reach. This exception (would
time permit) I should assoil, by shewing
how far, and by what means we may
attain to such a practice; (how at least
by aiming at this top of perfection we
may ascend nearer and nearer thereto)
in the mean time experience doth suffi∣ciently
evince possibility, and assuredly
that may be done, which we see done
before us: And so it is, pure charity hath
been the root of such affections and such
performances (recorded by indubitable
testimony) toward others, which hardly
any man can exceed in regard to himself;
nor indeed hath there scarce ever appea∣red
any heroical vertue, or memorable
piety, whereof charity overbearing sel∣fishness,
and sacrificing private interest
to publick benefit, hath not been a
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>
main ingredient. For instance then</P>
<P>Did not <HI>Abraham</HI> even prefer the
good of others before his own, when he
gladly did quit his countrey, patrimony,
friends, and kindred to pass his days in
a wandring pilgrimage, upon no other
encouragement than an overture of bles∣sing
on his posterity?</P>
<P>Did not the charity of <HI>Moses</HI> stretch
thus far,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or. 25. in</HI> Eph. <HI>Or.</HI> 7.</NOTE> when for the sake of his bre∣thren

<P>Did not <HI>Samuel</HI> exercise such a chari∣ty,
when being ingratefully and injuri∣ously
dismounted from his authority,
he did yet retain toward that people a
zealous desire of their welfare, <HI>not cea∣sing
earnestly to pray for them?</HI></P>
<P>Did not <HI>Jonathan</HI> love <HI>David</HI> equally
with himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 20. 30.</NOTE> when for his sake he chose
to incur the displeasure of his father and
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>
his King; when for his advantage he
was content to forfeit the privilege of
his birth, and the inheritance of a Crown;
when he could without envy or grudge
look on the growing prosperity of his
supplanter, could heartily wish his safe∣ty,
could effectually protect it, could
purchase it to him with his own great
danger and trouble? when he, that in
gallantry of courage and vertue did yield
to none, was yet willing to become in∣feriour
to one born his subject, one rai∣sed
from the dust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 78. 70.</NOTE> one <HI>taken from a sheep∣coat;</HI>
so that unrepiningly and without

are not these pregnant evidences, that
it was truly said in the story,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 18. 1. 20. 17.</NOTE> <HI>The soul
of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David,
and he loved him as his own soul?</HI></P>
<P>Did not the <HI>Psalmist</HI> competently prac∣tise
this duty; when in the sickness of his
ingratefull adversaries <HI>he cloathed himself
with sackcloath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 35. 12.</NOTE> <HI>he humbled his soul with
fasting; he bowed down heavily as one
that mourneth for his mother?</HI></P>
<P>Were not <HI>Elias, Jeremy,</HI> and other
<HI>Prophets</HI> as much concerned for the good
of their country-men as for their own,
when they took such pains, when they
<PB N="105" REF="56"/>
run such hazards, when they endured
such hardships not onely for them, but
from them; being requited with hatred
and misusage for endeavouring to re∣claim
them from sin, and stop them from
ruine?</P>
<P>May not the Holy Apostles seem to
have loved mankind beyond themselves,
when for its instruction and reformation,
for reconciling it to God and procuring
its salvation, they gladly did undertake
and undergo so many rough difficulties,
so many formidable dangers, such irk∣some
pains and troubles, such extream
wants and losses, such grievous ignomi∣nies
and disgraces; slighting all concerns
of their own, and reliquishing whatever
was most dear to them (their safety,
their liberty, their ease, their estate, their
reputation, their pleasure, their very
bloud and breath) for the welfare of
others; even of those who did spitefully
maligne and cruelly abuse them?</P>
<P>Survey but the Life of one among
them; mark the wearisome travels he
underwent over all the earth, the solici∣tous
cares which did possess his mind
<HI>for all the Churches:</HI> the continual toils
and drudgeries sustained by him in prea∣ching
by word and writing: in visiting,
<PB N="106" REF="57"/>
in admonishing, in all pastoral employ∣ments;
the imprisonments, the stripes,
the reproaches, the oppositions and per∣secutions
of every kind, and from all

he did ever conflict;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 23. 4. 8.</NOTE> peruse those black
catalogues of his afflictions registred by
himself;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4. 11.</NOTE> then tell me how much his cha∣rity
was inferiour to his self-love? did
not at least the one vie with the other,
when he for the benefit of his disciples
was content <HI>to be absent from the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 1. 24.</NOTE>
or suspended from a certain fruition of
glorious beatitude; resting in this un∣comfortable
state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE> in <HI>this fleshly taber∣nacle</HI>
wherein <HI>he groaned, being burthe∣ned,</HI>
and longing for enlargement? did
he not somewhat beyond himself love
those men, for whose salvation he wished
himself <HI>accursed from Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 3.</NOTE> or debarred
from the assured enjoyment of eternal
felicity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 24, 25.</NOTE> those very men by whom he
had been stoned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 2. 15.</NOTE> had been scourged, had
been often beaten to extremity, from
whom he had received manifold indig∣nities
and outrages?</P>
<P>Did not they love their neighbours
as themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 4. 34.</NOTE> who sold their possessions,
<PB N="107" REF="57"/>
and distributed the prices of them for
relief of their indigent brethren? did not
most of the ancient Saints and Fathers
mount near the top of this duty, of
whom it is by unquestionable records
testified, that they did freely bestow all
their private estate and substance on
the poor, devoting themselves to the ser∣vice
of God and edification of his people?
Finally,</P>
<P>Did not our Lord himself in our na∣ture
exemplifie this Duty, yea by his
Practice far out-doe his Precept? for,
He who from the brightest glories, from
the immense riches, from the ineffable

did willingly stoop down to as∣sume
the garb of a servant, to be cloa∣thed
with the infirmities of flesh, to be∣come
<HI>a man of sorrow, and acquainted

to live in extream penury and
disgrace, to feel hard want, sore tra∣vel,
bitter persecution, most grievous

be reviled, to be mocked, to be tortured,
to pour forth his heart-bloud upon a

in the height of his mortal agonies did
sue for the pardon of his cruel murthe∣rers;
who did send his Apostles to them,
did cause so many wonders to be done

to convert and save them; He that
acted and suffered all this, and more
than can be expressed, with perfect frank∣ness
and good will;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 2.</NOTE> did he not signally
love his neighbour as himself, to the
utmost measure? did not in him vertue
conquer nature, and charity triumph
over self-love? This he did to seal and
impress his Doctrine; to shew us what
we should doe, and what we can doe
by his grace; to oblige us and to encou∣rage
us unto a conformity with him in
this respect:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 1.</NOTE> for, <HI>Walk in love,</HI> saith the

<HEAD>The Fourth Sermon.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATT. 22. 39.</BIBL>
<Q>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy
self.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Have formerly discoursed on these
words, and then shewed how they
do import two observable Particu∣lars;
first a Rule of our Charity, or that
it should be like in nature; then a Mea∣sure
of it, or that it should be equal in
degree to the love which we do bear
to our selves. Of this latter interpretati∣on
I did assign divers reasons, urging
the observance of the Precept according
to that notion: but one material Point
scantness of time would not allow me
to consider; which is the removal of an
Exception, to which that interpretation
is very liable, and which is apt to discou∣rage
from a serious application to the
practice of this duty so expounded.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="60"/>
If, it may be said, the Precept be thus
understood, as to oblige us to love our
neighbours equally with our selves, it
will prove unpracticable, such a charity
being meerly romantick and imaginary;
for who doth, who can love his neigh∣bour
in this degree? nature powerfully
doth resist, common sense plainly doth
forbid that we should doe so: A natural
instinct doth prompt us to love our
selves, and we are forcibly driven there
to by an unavoidable sense of pleasure
and pain, resulting from the constitution
of our body and soul, so that our own
least good or evil are very sensible to us;
whereas we have no such potent incli∣nation
to love others; we have no sense
or a very faint one of what another doth
enjoy or endure: doth not therefore na∣ture
plainly suggest, that our neighbours
good cannot be so considerable to us as
our own? especially when charity doth
clash with self-love, or when there is a
competition between our neighbours in∣terest
and our own, is it possible that we
should not be partial to our own side?
is not therefore this Precept such as if
we should be commanded to fly, or to
doe that which natural propension will
certainly hinder?</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="60"/>
In answer to this Exception I say,
first,</P>
<P>1. Be it so, that we can never attain
to love our neighbour altogether so much
as our selves, yet may it be reasonable
that we should be enjoined to doe so;
for</P>
<P>Laws must not be depressed to our
imperfection, nor rules bent to our ob∣liquity;
but we must ascend toward the
perfection of them, and strive to con∣form
our practice to their exactness: If
what is prescribed be according to the
reason of things just and fit, it is enough
although our practice will not reach it;
for what remaineth may be supplied by
repentance and humility in him that
should obey, by mercy and pardon in
him that doth command.</P>
<P>In the prescription of duty it is just,
that what may be required (even in ri∣gour)
should be precisely determined,
though in execution of justice or dispen∣sation
of recompence consideration may
be had of our weakness; whereby both
the authority of our Governour may be
maintained, and his clemency glorified.</P>
<P>It is of great use, that by comparing
the Law with our practice, and in the
perfection of the one discerning the defect
<PB N="114" REF="61"/>
of the other, we may be humbled, may
be sensible of our impotency, may thence
be forced to seek the helps of grace and
the benefit of mercy.</P>
<P>Were the Rule never so low, our prac∣tice
would come beneath it; it is there∣fore
expedient that it should be high, that
at least we may rise higher in performance
than otherwise we should doe; for the
higher we aim, the nearer we shall go
to the due pitch; as he that aimeth at
heaven, although he cannot reach it,
will yet shoot higher than he that aim∣eth
onely at the house top.</P>
<P>The height of duty doth prevent sloth
and decay in vertue, keeping us in whol∣some
exercise and in continual improve∣ment,
while we be always climbing to∣ward
the top,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3. 12.</NOTE> and straining unto farther
attainment: the sincere prosecution of
which course, as it will be more profi∣table
unto us, so it will be no less accep∣table
to God, than if we could thorough∣ly
fulfill the Law: for in judgment God
will onely reckon upon the sincerity and
earnestness of our endeavour; so that if
we have done our best, it will be taken
as if we had done all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Our labour will
not be lost in the Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 1. 13.</NOTE> for the degrees
of performance will be considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6. 10.</NOTE> and
<PB N="115" REF="61"/>
he that hath done his duty in part shall
be proportionably recompensed; accor∣ding
to that of Saint <HI>Paul;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Every man
shall receive his own reward according to
his own work.</HI> Hence sometimes we are
enjoined to <HI>be perfect as our heavenly
father is perfect;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 48. 19. 21.</NOTE> and to be <HI>holy as God
is holy;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1. 16.</NOTE> otherwhile to <HI>go on to perfecti∣on,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 4. 12.</NOTE>
and to <HI>press toward the mark;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6. 1.</NOTE> which
Precepts in effect do import the same
thing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.</NOTE> but the latter implyeth the for∣mer,
although in attainment impossible,
yet in attempt very profitable: and sure∣ly
he is likely to write best, who pro∣poseth
to himself the fairest Copy for
his imitation.</P>
<P>In fine, if we do act what is possible,
or as we can, do conform to the Rule
of Duty, we may be sure that no im∣possibility
of this, or of any other sublime
Law can prejudice us.</P>
<P>I say of any other Law; for it is not
onely this Law, to which this exception
may be made; but many others, per∣haps
every one Evangelical Law, are
alike repugnant to corrupt nature, and
seem to surmount our ability.</P>
<P>But neither is the performance of this
task so impossible, or so desperately hard
(if we take the right course and use
<PB N="116" REF="62"/>
proper means toward it) as is supposed;
as may somewhat appear, if we will
weigh the following considerations.</P>
<P>1. Be it considered, that we may be
mistaken in our accompt, when we do
look on the impossibility or difficulty of
such a practice, as it appeareth at pre∣sent,
before we have seriously attempted,
and in a good method, by due means,
earnestly laboured to atchieve it: for
many things cannot be done at first, or
with a small practice, which by degrees
and a continued endeavour may be ef∣fected;
divers things are placed at a di∣stance,
so that without passing through
the interjacent way we cannot arrive at
them; divers things seem hard before
trial, which afterward prove very easie:
it is impossible to fly up to the top of a
steeple, but we may ascend thither by
steps; we cannot get to <HI>Rome</HI> without
crossing the Seas, and travelling through
<HI>France</HI> or <HI>Germany;</HI> it is hard to com∣prehend
a subtle <HI>Theoreme</HI> in <HI>Geometry</HI>
if we pitch on it first, but if we begin
at the simple principles, and go forward
through the intermediate propositions
we may easily attain a demonstration of
it; it is hard to swim, to dance, to play
on an Instrument, but a little trial, or a
<PB N="117" REF="62"/>
competent exercise will render those
things easie to us: So may the practice
of this duty seem impossible, or insupera∣bly
difficult, before we have employed
divers means, and voided divers impedi∣ments;
before we have inured our minds
and affections to it, before we have tri∣ed
our forces in some instances thereof,
previous to others of a higher strein,
and nearer the perfection of it.</P>
<P>If we would set our selves to exercise
charity in those instances, whereof we
are at first capable without much reluc∣tancy,
and thence proceed toward others
of a higher nature, we may find such
improvement, and taste such content
therein, that we may soon arise to in∣credible
degrees thereof; and at length
perhaps we may attain to such a pitch,
that it will seem to us base and vain to
consider our own good before that of
others, in any sensible measure; And
that nature which now so mightily doth
contest in favour of our selves, may in
time give way to a better nature, born
of custome, affecting the good of others.
Let not therefore a present sense or ex∣perience
raise in our minds a prejudice
against the possibility or practicableness
of this duty.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="63"/>
2. Let us consider, that in some re∣spects,
and in divers instances it is very
feasible to love our neighbour no less
than our selves.</P>
<P>We may love our neighbour truly
and sincerely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1. 6.</NOTE> <HI>out of a pure heart and a
good conscience, and faith unfeigned,</HI> as
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> doth prescribe; or according
to Saint <HI>Peter</HI>'s injunction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1. 22. (Rom. 12. 9.)</NOTE> <HI>from a pure
heart love one another fervently;</HI> and in
this respect we can do no more toward
our selves; for truth admitteth no de∣grees,
sincerity is a pure and compleat
thing, exclusive of all mixture or al∣loy.</P>
<P>And as to external acts at least it is
plain that charity toward others may
reach self-love; for we may be as serious,
as vigorous, as industrious in acting for
our neighbours good, as we can be in
pursuing our own designs and interests:
for reason easily can manage and govern
external practice; and common expe∣rience
sheweth the matter to this extent
practicable, seeing that often men do
employ as much diligence on the con∣cerns
of others, as they can do on their
own (being able to doe no more than
their best in either case) wherefore in
this respect charity may vie with selfish∣ness;
<PB N="119" REF="63"/>
and practising thus far may be a
step to mount higher.</P>
<P>Also rational consideration will enable
us to perform some interiour acts of cha∣rity
in the highest degree; for if we do
but, (as without much difficulty we
may do) apply our mind to weigh the
qualities and the actions of our neigh∣bour,
we may thence obtain a true opi∣nion
and just esteem of him; and (se∣cluding
gross folly or flattery of our
selves) how can we in that respect or
instance be more kind or benign to our
selves?</P>
<P>Is it not also within the compass of
our ability to repress those passions of
soul, the eruption whereof tendeth to
the wrong, dammage, and offence of
our neighbour; in regard to which prac∣tice
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> affirmeth, that the Law
may be fulfilled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Love,</HI> saith he, <HI>wor∣keth
no evil to his neighbour; there∣fore
love is the fulfilling of the law?</HI>
And what more in this respect can we
perform for our selves?</P>
<P>3. We may consider, that common∣ly
we see men inclined by other prin∣ciples
to act as much or more for the
sake of others, as they would for them∣selves.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="64"/>
Moral honesty hath inclined some,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—Arist. <HI>Eth.</HI> 9. 8.</NOTE>
ambition and popularity have excited
others to encounter the greatest dangers,
to attaque the greatest difficulties, to
expose their safety, to sacrifice their
lives for the welfare of their Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>Common friendship hath often done
as much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insana ami∣citia. <HI>Sen.</HI> Ep. 9.</NOTE> and brutish love (that <HI>mad
friendship,</HI> as <HI>Seneca</HI> calleth it) common∣ly
doth far more: for what will not a
fond Lover undertake and atchieve for
his Minion, although she really be the
worst enemy he can have? yet for such
a Snake will he not lavish his estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrys. <HI>in</HI> Eph. <HI>p.</HI> 797.</NOTE>
prostitute his honour, abandon his ease,
hazard his safety, shipwreck his consci∣ence,
forfeit his salvation? what may
not a <HI>Delilah</HI> obtain of her <HI>Sampson,</HI> a
<HI>Cleopatra</HI> of her <HI>Anthony,</HI> how prejudi∣cial
soever it be to his own interest and
welfare?</P>
<P>Why then may not a principle of
Charity (grounded on so much better
reason, and backed by so much stronger
motives) be conceived able to engage
men to the like practice? why may
not a man be disposed to doe that out
of hearty good-will, which he can doe
out of vain conceit, or vicious appetite?
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>
why shall other forces overbear nature,
and the power of charity be unable to
match it?</P>
<P>4. Let us consider, that those disposi∣tions
of soul which usually with so much
violence do thwart the observance of
this Precept, are not ingredients of true
self-love, by the which we are directed
to regulate our charity, but a spurious
brood of our folly and pravity, which
imply not a sober love of our selves, but
a corrupt fondness toward an idol of our
fancy mistaken for our selves.</P>
<P>A high conceit of our worth or abi∣lity,
of our fortune or worldly state, of
our works and atchievements; a great
complacence or confidence in some en∣dowment
or advantage belonging to us,
a stiff adherence to our own will or
humour, a greedy appetite to some par∣ticular
interest or base pleasure; these
are those, not attendants of natural
self-love, but issues of unnatural depra∣vedness
in judgment and affections,
which render our practice so exorbitant
in this regard, making us seem to love
our selves so immoderately, so infinite∣ly;
so contracting our souls and draw∣ing
them inwards, that we appear indis∣posed
to love our neighbour in any con∣siderable
<PB N="122" REF="65"/>
degree: If these (as by serious
consideration they may be) were voi∣ded,
or much abated, it would not be
found so grievous a matter to love our
neighbour as our selves; for that sober
love remaining behind, to which nature
inclineth, and which reason approveth,
would rather help to promote than
yield any obstacle to our charity; if
such perverse selfishness were checked
and depressed, but natural kindness che∣rished
and advanced, then true self-love
and charity would compose themselves
into near a just poise.</P>
<P>5. Indeed (which we may further
consider) our nature is not so absolute∣ly
averse or indisposed to the practice
of such charity, as to those may seem,
who view it slightly, either in some
particular instances, or in ordinary prac∣tice;
nature hath furnished us with
strong instincts for the defence and su∣stenance
of our life; and common prac∣tice
is depraved by ill education and
custom; these some men poring on do
imagin no room left for charity in the
constitution of men; but they consider
not, that one of these may be so mode∣rated,
and the other so corrected, that
charity may have a fair scope in mens
<PB N="123" REF="65"/>
heart and practice; and they slip over
divers pregnant marks of our natural
inclination thereto.</P>
<P>Man having received his soul from the
breath of God, and being framed after
the image of his most benign parent,
there do yet abide in him some features
resembling God, and reliques of the di∣vine
original; there are in us seeds of
ingenuity, of equity, of pity, of benig∣nity,
which being cultivated by sober
consideration and good use (under the
conduct, and aid of heavenly grace) will
produce noble fruits of charity.</P>
<P>The frame of our nature so far dis∣poseth
us thereto, that our bowels are
touched with sensible pain upon the
view of any calamitous object; our fan∣cy
is disturbed at the report of any disa∣ster
befalling any person; we can hard∣ly
see or reade a Tragedy without mo∣tions
of compassion.</P>
<P>The practice of benignity, of courte∣sy,
of clemency at first sight, without
any discursive reflexion, doth obtain ap∣probation
and applause from us; being
no less gratefull and amiable to the
mind than beauty to our eyes, harmo∣ny
to our ears, fragrancy to our smell,
and sweetness to our palate; and to the
<PB N="124" REF="66"/>
same mental sense malignity, cruelty,
harshness, all kinds of uncharitable dea∣ling
are very disgustfull and loathsome.</P>
<P>There wanteth not any commenda∣tion
to procure a respect for Charity;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—Arist. <HI>Eth.</HI> 8. 1.</NOTE>
nor any invective to breed abhorrence
of uncharitableness, nature sufficiently
prompting to favour the one and to de∣test
the other.</P>
<P>The practice of the former in common
language hath ever been styled humani∣ty,
and the disposition from whence it
floweth is called good-nature; the prac∣tice
of the latter is likewise termed in∣humanity,
and its source ill-nature; as
thwarting the common notions and in∣clinations
of mankind, devesting us of
our manhood, and rendring us a sort of
monsters among men.</P>
<P>No quality hath a clearer repute,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Arist. 9. 8. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> or
is commonly more admired than gene∣rosity,
which is a kind of natural cha∣rity,
or hath a great spice thereof; No
disposition is more despised among men
than niggardly selfishness; whence com∣monly
men are ashamed to avow self-interest
as a principle of their actions,
(rather fathering them on some other
cause) as being conscious to themselves
that it is the basest of all principles.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="66"/>
Whatever the censurers and detrac∣tours
of humane nature do pretend, yet
even themselves do admire pure bene∣ficence,
and contemn selfishness; for
(if we look to the bottom of their
intent) it is hence, they are bent to
slander mankind as void of good na∣ture,
because out of malignity they
would not allow it a quality so excel∣lent
and divine.</P>
<P>Wherefore according to the general
judgment and conscience of men (to
omit other considerations) our nature
is not so averse from charity, or desti∣tute
of propensions thereto; and there∣fore
cherishing the natural seeds of
it, we may improve it to higher de∣grees.</P>
<P>6. But supposing the inclinations of
nature, as it now standeth in its depra∣ved
and crazy state, do so mightily ob∣struct
the practice of this duty in the
degree specified, so that however we
cannot by any force of reason or philo∣sophy
attain to desire so much or relish
so well the good of others as our own,
yet we must remember, that a subsidia∣ry
power is by the divine mercy dis∣pensed,
able to controll and subdue na∣ture
to a compliance, to raise our prac∣tice
<PB N="126" REF="67"/>
above our natural forces. We have
a like averseness to other spiritual duties
(to the loving God with all our hearts,
to the mortifying our flesh and carnal
desires, to the contempt of wordly
things, and placing our happiness in
spiritual goods) yet we are able to per∣form
them by the succour of grace, and
in virtue of that omnipotency which
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> assumed to himself when he
said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 13. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—</NOTE> <HI>I can doe all things by Christ ena∣bling
me.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 1. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>If we can get <HI>the Spirit of love</HI> (and
assuredly we may get it, if we carefully
will seek it, with constant fervency im∣ploring
it from him, who hath promi∣sed
to bestow it on those that ask it)
it will infuse into our minds that light,
whereby we shall discern the excellency
of this duty, together with the folly
and baseness of that selfishness which
crosseth it; it will kindle in our hearts
charitable affections, disposing us to wish
all good to our neighbour, and to feel
pleasure therein; it will render us <HI>par∣takers
of that divine nature,</HI> which so
will guide and urge us in due measure
to affect the benefit of others, as now
corrupt nature doth move us unmeasu∣rably
to covet our own; being suppor∣ted
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>
and elevated by its virtue we may,
(surmounting the clogs of fleshly sense
and conceit) soar up to the due pitch
of charity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 4. 9. Gal. 5. 22. Eph. 5. 9. Col. 3. 12. Eph. 4. 24. 2. 10.</NOTE> being <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>taught of
God to love one another;</HI> and endowed
with <HI>the fruits of the Spirit,</HI> which are
<HI>love, gentleness, goodness, meekness,</HI> and
<HI>created according to God in Christ Jesus</HI>
to the practice of answerable <HI>good works.</HI></P>
<P>7. There are divers means conducible
to the abatement of difficulty in this
practice, which I shall propose, referring
the matter to issue upon due trial of
them.</P>
<P>1. Let us carefully weigh the value
of those things which immoderate self-love
doth affect in prejudice to chari∣ty,
together with the worth of those
which charity doth set in balance to
them.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> himself doth observe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—<HI>Arist.</HI> Eth. 9. 8. Vid. tot.</NOTE> that
the ground of culpable self-love, scraping,
scrambling, scuffling for particular inte∣rest,
is mens high esteem, and passion
for, and greedy appetite of wealth, of
honours, of corporeal pleasures; whereas
vertuous persons not admiring those
things will constanly act for honesty
sake, and out of love to their friends or
countrey; wherein although they most
<PB N="128" REF="68"/>
really benefit and truly gratifie them
selves, yet are they not blamed for sel∣fishness.</P>
<P>And so indeed it is; If we rightly
did apprehend the infinite vanity of all
wordly goods, the meanness of private
concerns, the true despicableness of all
those honours, those profits, those de∣lights
on which commonly men do so
dote, we should not be so fond or jealous
of them, as to scrape or scuffle for them,
envying or grutching them to others;
If we did conceive the transcendent
worth of future rewards allotted to this
and other vertues, the great considerable∣ness
of publick good at which charity
aimeth, the many advantages which
may accrue to us from our neighbours
welfare, (entertained with complacence,
and wisely accommodated to our use)
we should not be so averse from tendring
his good as our own.</P>
<P>2. Let us consider our real state in
the world, in dependance upon the
pleasure and providence of Almighty
God.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="68"/>
If we look upon our selves as subsist∣ing
onely by our own care and endea∣vour,
without any other patronage or
help, it may thence prove hard to re∣gard
the interests of others as compa∣rable
to our own; seeing then in order
to our living with any convenience, it is
necessary that we should be solicitous
for our own preservation and sustenance,
that will engage us to contend with
others as competitours for the things
we need, and uncapable otherwise to
attain: But if (as we ought to doe, and
the true state of things requireth) we
consider our selves as subsisting under
the protection, and by the providence
of God, who no less careth for us than
for others, and no less for others than
for us (for, as the Wise-man saith, he
<HI>careth for all alike)</HI> who recommendeth
to us a being mutually concerned each
for other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Sap. 6. 7.</NOTE> and is engaged to keep us
from suffering thereby; who comman∣deth
us to disburthen our cares upon
himself; who assuredly will the better
provide for us, as we do more further
the good of others: If we do consider
thus, it will deliver us from solicitude
concerning our subsistence and personal
accommodations, whence we may be
<PB N="130" REF="69"/>
free to regard the concerns of others,
with no less application than we do re∣gard
our own.</P>
<P>As living under the same Government
and Laws (being members of one Com∣monwealth,
one Corporation, one Fa∣mily)
disposeth men not onely willing∣ly
but earnestly to serve the publick in∣terest,
beyond any hopes of receiving
thence any particular advantage answe∣rable
to their pain and care; so conside∣ring
our selves as members of the world,
and of the Church, under the governance
and patronage of God, may disengage
us from immoderate respect of private
good, and incline us to promote the
common welfare.</P>
<P>3. There is one plain way of rendring
this duty possible, or of perfectly recon∣ciling
charity to self-love; which is, a
making the welfare of our neighbour to
be our own, which if we can doe, then
easily may we desire it most seriously,
then may we promote it with the grea∣test
zeal and vigour; for then it will be an
instance of self-love to exercise charity,
then both these inclinations conspiring
will march evenly together, one will
not extrude nor depress the other.</P>
<P>It may be hard, while our concerns
<PB N="131" REF="69"/>
appear divided, not to prefer our own,
but when they are coincident, or con∣spire
together, the ground of that par∣tiality
is removed.</P>
<P>Nor is this an imaginary course, but
grounded in reason, and thereby redu∣cible
to practice: for considering the
manifold bands of relation (natural, ci∣vil,
or spiritual) between men, as natu∣rally
of the same kind and bloud, as ci∣villy
members of the same society, as
spiritually linked in one brotherhood;
considering the mutual advantages deri∣vable
from the wealth and welfare of
each other, (in way of needfull succour,
advice and comfort, of profitable com∣merce,
of pleasant conversation); con∣sidering
the mischiefs, which from our
neighbours indigency and affliction we
may incur, they rendring him as a wild
beast, unsociable, troublesome and for∣midable
to us; considering that we can∣not
be happy without good nature, and
good humour, and that good nature can∣not
behold any sad object without pity
and dolorous resentment, good humour
cannot subsist in prospect of such objects;
considering that charity is an instrument,
whereby we may apply all our neigh∣bours
good to our selves, it being ours,
<PB N="132" REF="70"/>
if we can find complacence therein; it
may appear reasonable to reckon all our
neighbours concerns to our accompt.</P>
<P>That this is practicable, experience
may confirm; for we may observe, that
men commonly do thus appropriate the
concerns of others, resenting the disasters
of a friend, or of a relation with as sen∣sible
displeasure as they could their own;
and answerably finding as high a satis∣faction
in their good fortune. Yea ma∣ny
persons do feel more pain by com∣passion
for others, than they could do
in sustaining the same evils; divers can
with a stout heart undergo their own
afflictions, who are melted with those
of a friend or brother. Seeing then in
true judgment humanity doth match
any other relation, and Christianity far
doth exceed all other alliances, why
may we not on them ground the like
affections and practices, if reason hath
any force, or consideration can any wise
sway in our practice?</P>
<P>4. It will greatly conduce to the per∣fect
observance of this Rule, to the de∣pression
of self-love, and advancement of
charity to the highest pitch, if we do
studiously contemplate our selves, strict∣ly
examining our conscience, and seri∣ously
<PB N="133" REF="70"/>
reflecting on our unworthiness and
vileness; the infirmities and defects of
nature, the corruptions and defilements
of our soul, the sins and miscarriages of
our lives; which doing, we shall cer∣tainly
be far from admiring or doting
on our selves; but rather, as <HI>Job</HI> did,
we shall <HI>condemn</HI> and <HI>abhor our selves;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 9. 20.</NOTE>
when we see our selves so deformed and
ugly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 42. 6.</NOTE> how can we be amiable in our
own eyes? how can we more esteem
or affect our selves than others, of whose
unworthiness we can hardly be so con∣scious
or sure? what place can there be
for that vanity and folly, for that pride
and arrogance, for that partiality and in∣justice,
which are the sources of immo∣derate
self-love?</P>
<P>5. And lastly, we may from many
conspicuous Experiments and Examples
be assur'd that such a practice of this Du∣ty
is not impossible; but these I have
already produced and urged in the pre∣cedent
Discourse, and shall not repeat
them again.</P>

importance, it is most requisite that we

observe it; to which purposes I shall by
God's assistance endeavour to confer
somewhat, first by explaining its Nature,
then by pressing the observance of it by
several Inducements.</P>
<P>The nature of it will, as I conceive,
be best understood by representing the

adherents to it; some internally resident
in the soul, others discharged in external
performance; together with some spe∣cial
properties of it. And such are those
which follow.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Loving our neighbour</HI> doth imply,
that we should value and esteem him:
this is necessary, for affection doth fol∣low
opinion; so that we cannot like
any thing which we do not esteem, or
wherein we do not apprehend some con∣siderable
good, attractive of affection;
that is not amiable which is wholly con∣temptible;
or so far as it is such.</P>

all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 38. 36. 146. 9.</NOTE> art not thou thy self obnoxious
to the like? hath not God declared that
he hath a special regard to such? and
are not such things commonly disposed
by his hand with a gracious intent?</P>
<P>Is it for meanness of parts, or abilities,
or endowments? but are not these the
gifts of God, absolutely at his disposal,
and arbitrarily distributed, or preserved;
so that thou who art so wise in thy own
conceit to day, mayest by a disease, or
from a judgment (deserved by thy pride)
become an Idiot to morrow?<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1. 26.</NOTE> have not
many good and therefore many happy
men wanted those things?</P>
<P>Is it for moral imperfections or ble∣mishes;
for vicious habits, or actual mis∣demeanours?
these indeed are the onely
debasements and disparagements of a
man; yet do they not expunge the cha∣racters
of Divinity impressed on his na∣ture;
and he may be God's mercy re∣cover
from them: And are not we our
selves, if grace do not uphold us, liable
to the same? yea may we not, if with∣out
partiality or flattery we examin our
selves, discern the same within us, or
other defects equivalent? And however
is not pity rather due to them than con∣tempt?
whose character was it, that
<PB N="141" REF="74"/>
<HI>they trusted they were righteous and de∣spised
others?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 18. 9. 16. 15.</NOTE> That the most palpable
offender should not be quite despised
God had a special care in his Law, for
that end moderating punishment, and
restraining the number of stripes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 25. 2-</NOTE> <HI>If</HI>
(saith the Law) <HI>the wicked man be wor∣thy
to be beaten, the Judge shall cause
him to lye down, and to be beaten before
his face, according to his fault, by a cer∣tain
number; forty stripes he may give
him and not exceed; lest if he should ex∣ceed,
and beat him above these with ma∣ny
stripes, then thy brother should seem
vile unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>We may consider, that the common
things (both good and bad) wherein
men agree, are far more considerable
than the peculiar things wherein they
differ; to be a Man is much beyond be∣ing
a Lord, or a Wit, or a Philosopher;
to be a Christian doth infinitely surpass
being an Emperour, or a learned Clerk;
to be a Sinner is much worse than to be
Begger or an Idiot: The agreement of
men is in the substance and body of
things; the difference is in a circum∣stance,
a fringe, or a shadow about
them; so that we cannot despise ano∣ther
man, without reflecting contempt
<PB N="142" REF="75"/>
on our selves, who are so very like him,
and not considerably better than he, or
hardly can without arrogance pretend to
be so.</P>
<P>We may therefore, and reason doth
require that we should value our neigh∣bour;
and it is no impossible or unrea∣sonable
Precept which Saint <HI>Peter</HI> gi∣veth
us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 2. 17.</NOTE> to <HI>Honour all men;</HI> and with
it a charitable mind will easily comply;
it ever will descry something valuable,
something honourable, something ami∣able
in our neighbour; it will find some∣what
of dignity in the meanest, some∣what
of worth in the basest, somewhat
hopefull in the most degenerate of men;
it therefore will not absolutely slight or
scorn any man whatever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 7.</NOTE> looking on
him as an abject or forlorn wretch, un∣worthy
of consideration.</P>
<P>It is indeed a point of charity to see
more things estimable in others than
in our selves; or to be apprehensive of
more defects meriting disesteem in our
selves than in others; and consequently
in our opinion to prefer others before
us, according to those Apostolical Pre∣cepts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 10.</NOTE>
<HI>Be kindly affected one toward ano∣ther
with brotherly love, in honour pre∣ferring
one another.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 3.</NOTE> <HI>In lowliness of mind
<PB N="143" REF="75"/>
let each esteem other better than them∣selves.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>Be subject one to another.</HI></P>
<P>II. Loving our neighbour doth im∣ply
a sincere and earnest desire of his
welfare, and good of all kinds, in due
proportion: for it is a property of love,
that it would have its object most wor∣thy
of it self, and consequently that it
should attain the best state whereof it is
capable, and persist firm therein; to be
fair and plump, to flourish and thrive
without diminution or decay; this is
plain to experience in respect to any
other thing (a horse, a flower, a building,
or any such thing) which we pretend to
love; wherefore charity should dispose
us to be thus affected to our neighbour;
so that we do not look upon his condi∣tion
or affairs with an indifferent eye,
or cold heart, but are much concerned
for him, and put forth hearty wishes for
his interests: we should wish him ador∣ned
with all vertue, and accomplished
with all worthy endowments of soul;
we should wish him prosperous success
in all his designs, and a comfortable sa∣tisfaction
of his desires; we should wish
him with alacrity of mind to reap the
fruits of his industry, and to enjoy the
<PB N="144" REF="76"/>
best accommodations of his life. Not
formally and in complement, as the
mode is, but really and with a cordial
sense, upon his undertaking any enter∣prize,
we should wish him good speed;
upon any prosperous success of his en∣deavours,
we should bid him joy;
wherever he is going, whatever he is
doing, we should wish him peace and
the presence of God with him: we
should tender his health, his safety, his
quiet, his reputation, his wealth, his
prosperity in all respects; but especially
with peculiar ardency we should desire
his final welfare, and the happiness of
his soul, that being incomparably his
chief concern.</P>
<P>Hence readily should we pour forth
our prayers, which are the truest ex∣pressions
of good desire, for the welfare
of our neighbour, to him who is able to
work and bestow it.</P>
<P><HI>Such was the charity of Saint</HI> Paul
<HI>for his Country-men, signified in those
words,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10. 1.</NOTE> Brethren, my hearts desire▪ and
prayer to God for Israel is, that they
may be saved; <HI>such was his love to the</HI>
Philippians,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> God is my record how great∣ly
I long after you all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 1. 8—</NOTE> in the bowels of
Iesus Christ;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 13. 9.</NOTE> and this I pray, that your
<PB N="145" REF="76"/>
love may abound more and more in know∣ledge,
and in all judgment—</P>
<P><HI>Such was Saint</HI> John'<HI>s charity to his
friend</HI> Gaius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Joh. 2.</NOTE> <HI>to whom he said,</HI> Beloved,
I wish above all things, that thou maist
prosper and be in health even as thy soul
prospereth.</P>
<P>Such is the charity, which we are
enjoined to express toward all men, by
<HI>praying for all men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 3.</NOTE> in conformity to
the charity of God, who <HI>will have all
men to be saved, and to come to the know∣ledge
of the truth.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the charity we are comman∣ded
to use toward our enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 44.</NOTE> <HI>blessing
those who curse us, and praying for those
who despitefully use us, and persecute us;</HI>
the which was exemplified by our <HI>Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 23. 34.</NOTE>
by Saint <HI>Stephen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 7. 60.</NOTE> by all the <HI>Holy A∣postles.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>III. Charity doth imply a compla∣cence
or delightfull satisfaction in the
good of our neighbour; this is conse∣quent
on the former property, for that
joy naturally doth result from events
agreeable to our desire: Charity hath a
good eye, which is not offended or daz∣led
with the lustre of its neighbour's ver∣tue,
or with the splendour of his fortune,
<PB N="146" REF="77"/>
but vieweth either of them steadily with
pleasure, as a very delightfull spectacle;
It beholdeth him to prosper and flourish,
to grow in wealth and repute not one∣ly
without envious repining, but with
gladsome content:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 15.</NOTE> Its property is <HI>to re∣joice
with them that rejoice;</HI> to partake
of their enjoyments, to feast in their
pleasures, to triumph in their success.</P>
<P>As one member doth feel the health,
and the delight which another immedi∣ately
doth enjoy; so hath a charitable
man a sensible complacence in the wel∣fare
and joy of his neighbour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>His prosperity of any kind, in pro∣portion
to its importance, doth please
him; but especially his spiritual profici∣ency
and improvement in vertue doth
yield matter of content; and his good
deeds he beholdeth with abundant satis∣faction.</P>
<P>This is that instance of charity which
S. <HI>Paul</HI> so frequently doth express in his
<HI>Epistles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 13. 9.</NOTE> declaring the extream joy he
did feel in the faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 2. 4. 1.</NOTE> in the vertue, in the
orderly conversation of those brethren to
whom he writeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 3. 9. 2. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>This charity possessed Saint <HI>John,</HI>
when he said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Joh. 4.</NOTE> <HI>I have no greater joy than
to hear that my children walk in truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="77"/>
This is the charity of heaven, which
doth even cheer the Angels, and doth
enhance the bliss of the blessed Spirits
there;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 15. 7, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> of whom it is said, <HI>There is joy
in heaven over every sinner that repen∣teth.</HI>
Hence, This is the disposition of
charitable persons sincerely to congratu∣late
any good occurrence to their neigh∣bour;
they are ready to conspire in ren∣dring
thanks and praise to the Authour
of their welfare; taking the good con∣ferred
on their neighbour as a blessing
and obligation on themselves; so that
they upon such occasions are apt to say
with Saint <HI>Paul;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 3. 9.</NOTE> <HI>What thanks can we
render to God for you, for all the joy
wherewith we joy for your sakes before
God?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and, <HI>We are bound to thank God
always for you, brethren, because that
your faith groweth exceedingly, and that
the charity of every one of you all toward
each other aboundeth:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1. 4, 5. (Phil. 1. 3. Rom. 1. 8. Eph. 1. 16. Col. 1. 3. 1 Thess. 1. 2.)</NOTE> and, <HI>I thank my
God always on your behalf for the grace
of God, which is given you by Jesus Christ,
that in every thing ye are enriched by
him.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Precept of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Give
thanks always</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is
translated <HI>for all things,</HI> but it might as
well be rendred <HI>for all persons,</HI> accor∣ding
<PB N="148" REF="78"/>
to that Injunction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 1.</NOTE> <HI>I exhort, that
first of all supplications, prayers, inter∣cessions,
and giving of thanks be made for
all men;</HI> Not onely Prayers are to be
made, but Thanksgivings are to be of∣fered
for all men, out of general charity.</P>
<P>IV. Correspondently, Love of our
neighbour doth imply condolency and
commiseration of the evils befalling him:
for what we love, we cannot without
displeasure behold lying in a bad condi∣tion,
sinking into decay, or in danger
to perish; so to a charitable mind the
bad state of any man is a most unplea∣sant
and painfull sight.</P>
<P>It is the property of Charity <HI>to mourn
with those that mourn;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> not coldly, but
passionately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 15.</NOTE> (for 'tis, <HI>to weep with those
that weep)</HI> resenting every mans case
with an affection sutable thereto, and
as he doth himself resent it.</P>
<P>Is any man fallen into disgrace? cha∣rity
doth hold down its head, is abashed
and out of countenance, partaking of
his shame: Is any man disappointed of
his hopes or endeavours? charity crieth
out <HI>alas,</HI> as if it were it self defeated:
Is any man afflicted with pain or sick∣ness?
charity looketh sadly, it sigheth
<PB N="149" REF="78"/>
and groaneth, it fainteth and languisheth
with him: Is any man pinched with
hard want? charity if it cannot succour,
it will condole: doth ill news arrive?
charity doth hear it with an unwilling
ear, and a sad heart, although not par∣ticularly
concerned in it: The sight of
a Wreck at Sea, of a Field spread with
Carcases, of a Country desolated, of
Houses burnt, and Cities ruined, and of
the like calamities incident to mankind,
would touch the bowels of any man;
but the very report of them would af∣fect
the heart of charity: It doth not
suffer a man with comfort or ease to en∣joy
the accommodations of his own
state, while others before him are in di∣stress:
It cannot be merry while any
man in presence is sorrowfull; it cannot
seem happy while its neighbour doth ap∣pear
miserable: It hath a share in all the
afflictions which it doth behold or hear
of; according to that instance in Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> of the <HI>Philippians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Ye have done
well, that ye did communicate with</HI> (or
partake in) <HI>my afflictions;</HI> and according
to that Precept,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 13. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Remember those which
are in bonds, as bound with them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such was the charity of</HI> Job:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 30. 25.</NOTE> Did
not I weep for him that was in trouble?
<PB N="150" REF="79"/>
was not my soul grieved for the poor?</P>
<P><HI>Such was the charity of the</HI> Psalmist,
<HI>even toward his ingratefull enemies,</HI>
They <HI>(saith he)</HI> rewarded me evil for
good to the spoiling of my soul;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 35. 12, 13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>but as
for me, when they were sick,</HI> my cloa∣thing
was sackcloath, I humbled my soul
with fasting—I behaved my self, as
though it had been my friend or my bro∣ther,
I bowed down heavily as one that
mourneth for his mother.</P>
<P><HI>Such was the charity of Saint</HI> Paul;
Who is weak,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 29.</NOTE> <HI>said he,</HI> and I am not weak▪
who is offended, and I burn not? <HI>with
fervent compassion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such was the charity of our</HI> Saviour;
<HI>which so reigned in his heart, that no
passion is so often attributed to him as
this of pity; it being expressed to be the
motive of his great works.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 14. 14.</NOTE> Jesus <HI>(saith
Saint</HI> Matthew) went forth, and saw a
great multitude, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and was moved <HI>(in his bowels)</HI>
with compassion toward them, and he hea∣led
their sick;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>and,</HI> I have compassion on
the multitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 15. 32.</NOTE> because they have nothing
to eat, and I will not send them away fa∣sting,
lest they faint in the way; <HI>and,</HI>
Iesus had compassion on them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 20. 34.</NOTE> and touched
their eyes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark. 1. 41.</NOTE> <HI>and,</HI> Jesus moved with com∣passion
<PB N="151" REF="79"/>
put forth his hand and touched
him <HI>(the Leper)</HI> and saith unto him, I
will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 7. 13.</NOTE> be thou clean; <HI>and,</HI> When the Lord
saw her <HI>(the Widow of</HI> Naim, <HI>whose
Son was carried out)</HI> he had compassion
on her;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 19. 41.</NOTE> <HI>and,</HI> He beheld the city and wept
over it, <HI>considering the miseries impen∣dent
on it, as a just punishment of their
outragious injuries against himself; and
when the two good Sisters did bewail
their Brother</HI> Lazarus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 11. 33, 35.</NOTE> He groaned in
spirit and was troubled; <HI>and</HI> wept <HI>with
them; whence the</HI> Jews <HI>did collect,</HI> Be∣hold
how he loved him.</P>
<P>Thus any calamity or misfortune be∣falling
his neighbour doth raise distastefull
regret and commiseration in a charitable
soul; but especially moral evils (which
indeed are the great evils, in comparison
whereto nothing else is evil) do work
that effect: To see men dishonour and
wrong their Maker, to provoke his an∣ger,
and incur his disfavour; to see men
abuse their reason, and disgrace their
nature; to see men endammage their
spiritual estate, to endanger the loss of
their souls, to discost from their happi∣ness,
and run into eternal ruine, by di∣stemper
of mind, and an inordinate con∣versation;
this is most afflictive to a
<PB N="152" REF="80"/>
man endewed with any good degree of
charity. Could one see a man sprawling
on the ground, weltring in his bloud,
with gaping wounds, gasping for breath,
without compassion? And seeing the con∣dition
of him that lieth groveling in sin,
weltring in guilt, wounded with bitter
remorse and pangs of conscience, nearly
obnoxious to eternal death, is far worse
and more deplorable, how can it but
touch the heart of a charitable man, and
stir his bowels with compassionate an∣guish?</P>
<P><HI>Such was the excellent charity of the
Holy</HI> Psalmist, <HI>signified in those ejacu∣lations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 158.</NOTE>
I beheld the transgressours and
was grieved, because they kept not thy
word;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 136.</NOTE> <HI>and,</HI> Rivers of waters run down
mine eyes, because men keep not thy law.</P>
<P>Such was the charity of Saint <HI>Paul</HI>
toward his incredulous and obdurate
Country-men (notwithstanding their
hatred and ill treatment of himself) the
which he so earnestly did aver in those
words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>I say the truth, I lie not, my
conscience also bearing me witness in the
Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness
and continual sorrow in my heart</HI> for
them.</P>
<P><HI>Such was the charity of our</HI> Lord,
<PB N="153" REF="80"/>
<HI>which disposed him as to a continual
sense of mens evils, so upon particular
occasions to grieve at their sins and
spiritual wants; as when the</HI> Pharisees
<HI>maligned him for his doing good, he
('tis said) did</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 3. 5.</NOTE> grieve <HI>(or
condole)</HI> for the hardness of their heart;
<HI>and</HI> when he saw the multitudes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 9. 36.</NOTE> he was
moved with compassion on them, because
they fainted, and were scattered abroad,
as sheep having no shepheard; <HI>and, when</HI>
he wept over Jerusalem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 19. 41.</NOTE> <HI>because it did
not</HI> know in its day the things which be∣longed
to its peace <HI>(either temporal, or
eternal.)</HI></P>
<P>This is that charity, which God him∣self
in a wonderfull and incomprehen∣sible
manner doth exemplifie to us; for
he is <HI>the Father of pities;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 5. 11.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 1. 78.</NOTE>
<HI>full of bowels;</HI> his <HI>bowels are trou∣bled,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 31. 20.</NOTE>
and <HI>do sound,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 63. 15.</NOTE> when he is (for up∣holding
justice, or reclaiming sinners)
constrained to inflict punishment; of
him 'tis said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jud. 10. 16.</NOTE> that <HI>his soul was grieved
for the misery of Israel;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">(<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. LXX.)</NOTE> and, that he
was <HI>afflicted in all the afflictions</HI> of his
people:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 63. 9.</NOTE> So incredible miracles doth in∣finite
charity work in God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">(Hos. 11. 8.)</NOTE> that the im∣passible
God in a manner should suffer
with us, that happiness it self should par∣take
<PB N="154" REF="81"/>
take in our misery, that grief should
spring up in the fountain of joy: How
this can be, we thoroughly cannot well
apprehend, but surely those expresses
are used in condescension to signifie the
greatly charitable benignity of God, and
to shew us our duty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 6. 36.</NOTE> that <HI>we should be
mercifull as our heavenly Father is mer∣cifull,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 1.</NOTE>
sympathizing with the miseries
and sorrows of our brethren.<NOTE PLACE="marg">(Luk. 16. 20.)</NOTE></P>
<P>This is that duty, which is so frequent∣ly
inculcated; when we are charged to
<HI>put on bowels of pity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 12.</NOTE> to be (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
<HI>tender-hearted,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 1.</NOTE> to be (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
<HI>compassionate</HI> one toward another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 32.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>Hence it is, that good men in this
world cannot live in any briskness of
mirth or height of jollity, their own
enjoyments being tempered by the dis∣contents
of others; the continual obvi∣ous
spectacles of sorrow, and of sin
damping their pleasures, and quashing
excessive transports of joy: for who
could much enjoy himself in an hospital,
in a prison, in a charnel?</P>
<P>V. It is generally a property of Love
to appropriate its Object; in apprehen∣sion
and affection embracing it, posses∣sing
it, enjoying it as its own: So cha∣rity
<PB N="155" REF="81"/>
doth make our neighbour to be
ours, engaging us to tender his case,
and his concerns as our own; so that
we shall exercise about them the same
affections of soul (the same desires, the
same hopes and fears, the same joys and
sorrows) as about our own nearest and
most peculiar interest; so that his dan∣ger
will affright us, and in his security
we shall find repose; his profit is gain,
and his losses are dammages to us; we
do rise by his preserment, and sink down
by his fall; his good speed is a satisfac∣tion,
and his disappointment a cross to
us; his enjoyments afford pleasure, and
his sufferings bring pain to us.</P>
<P>So charity doth enlarge our minds be∣yond
private considerations, conferring
on them an universal interest, and redu∣cing
all the world within the verge of
their affectionate care; so that a mans
self is a very small and inconsiderable
portion of his regard; whence Charity
is said not to <HI>seek its own things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 5. 10. 24.</NOTE> and
we are commanded not to <HI>look on our
own things;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 4.</NOTE> for that the regard which
charity beareth to its own interest in
comparison to that, which it beareth to∣ward
the concerns of others, hath the
same proportion as one man hath to all
<PB N="156" REF="82"/>
men, being therefore exceedingly small,
and as it were none at all.</P>
<P>This <HI>(saith Saint</HI> Chryso∣stome)
is the Canon of most
perfect Christianisme,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Chrys.</HI> in 1 Cor. Orat. 25.</NOTE> this is
an exact boundary, this is the
highest top of it, to seek things
profitable to the publick: <HI>And</HI>
according to this rule <HI>charity</HI> doth walk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 16.</NOTE>
<HI>it prescribeth that compass to it self, it
aspireth to that pitch; it disposeth to
act as Saint</HI> Paul <HI>did,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 33.</NOTE> I please all men
in all things, not seeking mine own pro∣fit,
but the profit of many, that they may
be saved.</P>
<P>VI. It is a property of Love to affect
union, or the greatest approximation
that can be to its Object: As hatred
doth set things at distance, making them
to shun or chase away one another; so
love doth attract things, doth combine
them, doth hold them fast together;
every one would be embracing and en∣joying
what he loveth in the manner
whereof it is capable: So doth charity
dispose a man to conjunction with o∣thers;
it soon will breed acquaintance,
kind conversation, and amicable corre∣spondence
with our neighbour.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="82"/>
It would be a stranger to no man to
whom by its entercourse it may yield
any benefit or comfort.</P>
<P>Its arms are always open, and its bo∣some
free to receive all, who do not re∣ject
or decline its amity.</P>
<P>It is most frankly accessible, most af∣fable,
most tractable, most sociable, most
apt to interchange good offices; most
ready to oblige others, and willing to
be obliged by them.</P>
<P>It voideth that unreasonable suspici∣ousness
and diffidence, that timorous
shieness, that crafty reservedness, that
supercilious morosity, that fastidious
sullenness, and the like untoward dispo∣sitions,
which keep men in estrangement,
stifling good inclinations to familiarity
and friendship.</P>
<P>VII. It is a property of Love to de∣sire
a reciprocal affection;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spes mutuae charitatis.</NOTE> for that is the
surest possession and firmest union,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sen. <HI>Ep.</HI> 9.</NOTE> which
is grounded upon voluntary conspiring
in affection; and if we do value any per∣son,
we cannot but prize his good will
and esteem.</P>
<P>Charity is the mother of friendship,
not onely as inclining us to love others,
but as attracting others to love us; dis∣posing
<PB N="158" REF="83"/>
us to affect their amity, and by
obliging means to procure it.</P>
<P>Hence is that Evangelical Precept so
often enjoined to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 14.</NOTE> of <HI>pursuing peace
with all men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 22.</NOTE> importing that we should
desire and seek by all fair means the
good will of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 18.</NOTE> without which peace
from them cannot subsist; for if they
do not love us, they will be infesting us
with unkind words or deeds.</P>
<P>VIII. Hence also Charity disposeth
to please our neighbour, not onely by
inoffensive but by obliging demeanour;
by a ready complaisance and compliance
with his fashion, with his humour, with
his desire in matters lawfull, or in a way
consistent with duty and discretion.</P>
<P><HI>Such charity Saint</HI> Paul <HI>did prescribe,</HI>
Let every one please his neighbour for
his good to edification:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Such he practised
himself,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 33.</NOTE> Even as I please all men in all
things, not seeking mine own profit; <HI>and,</HI>
I have made my self a servant to all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 19.</NOTE> that
I might gain the more.</P>
<P>Such was the charity of our Lord,
for <HI>even Christ pleased not himself:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 3.</NOTE> He
indeed did stoop to converse with sorry
men in their way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 2. 2.</NOTE> he came when he
was invited, he accepted their entertain∣ment,
<PB N="159" REF="83"/>
he from the frankness of his con∣versation
with all sorts of persons did
undergo the reproach of being <HI>a wine∣bibber,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 11. 19.</NOTE>
<HI>a friend of Publicans and sinners:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 7. 34.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is the <HI>Genius</HI> and complexion of
charity to affect nothing uncouth or sin∣gular
in matters of indifferent nature;
to be candid, not rigid in opinion; to be
pliable; not stiff in humour; to be
smooth and gentle, not rugged and pee∣vish
in behaviour.</P>
<P>It doth indeed not flatter, not sooth,
not humour any man in bad things, or
in things very absurd and foolish; it
would rather chuse to displease and cross
him, than to abuse, to delude, to wrong,
or hurt him; but excepting such cases,
it gladly pleaseth all men, denying its
own will and conceit to satisfie the plea∣sure
and fancy of others; practising that
which Saint <HI>Peter</HI> injoined
in that Precept,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 1 Pet. 3. 8.</NOTE> <HI>be of one
mind, be compassionate, love
as brethren, be pitifull, be
courteous;</HI> or as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> might intend,
when he bid us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 32.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 13.</NOTE> <HI>to
gratifie, to indulge one another.</HI></P>
<P>IX. Love of our neighbour doth im∣ply
readiness upon all occasions to do
<PB N="160" REF="84"/>
him good, to promote and advance his
benefit in all kinds.</P>
<P>It doth not rest in good opinions of
mind, and good affections of heart, but
from those roots doth put forth abun∣dant
fruits of real beneficence; it will
not be satisfied with faint desires, or
sluggish wishes, but will be up and do∣ing
what it can for its neighbour.</P>
<P>Love is a busie and active,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Love is strong as death.</NOTE> a vigorous
and sprightfull, a couragious and indu∣strious
disposition of soul;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 8. 6.</NOTE> which will
prompt a man, and push him forward
to undertake or undergo any thing, to
endure pains, to encounter dangers, to
surmount difficulties for the good of its
object.</P>
<P>Such is true charity; it will dispose
us <HI>to love,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3. 8.</NOTE> as Saint <HI>John</HI> prescribeth,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 2. 16.</NOTE> <HI>in work and in truth;</HI>
not onely in mental desire, but in effec∣tual
performance; not onely in verbal
pretence, but in real effect.</P>
<P>Hence charity will render a man a
General benefactour, in all matters, up∣on
all occasions;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> affording to his neigh∣bour
all kinds of assistance and relief,
according to his neighbours need,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 20. 35.</NOTE> and
his own ability:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 1 Thess. 5. 14.</NOTE> It will make him a
bountifull dispenser of his goods to the
<PB N="161" REF="84"/>
poor, a comforter of the afflicted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> a vi∣siter
of the sick, an instructour of the
ignorant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 14.</NOTE> an adviser of the doubtfull, a
protectour of the oppressed, a hospitable
entertainer of strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 29. 17.</NOTE> a reconciler of
differences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 31. 32.</NOTE> an intercessour for offenders,
an advocate of those who need de∣fence,
a succourer of all that want
help.</P>
<P><HI>The practice of</HI> Job <HI>describeth its na∣ture;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 29. 12.</NOTE>
I <HI>(saith he)</HI> delivered the poor
that cried, and the fatherless, and him
that had none to help him: The blessing
of him that was ready to perish came up∣on
me, and I caused the widows heart to
sing for joy. I was eyes to the blind, and
feet was I to the lame; I was a father to
the poor, and the cause which I knew not
I searched out; And I brake the jaws of
the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of
his teeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job. 32. 16.</NOTE> If I have held the poor from
their desire, or have caused the eyes of
the widow to fail; Or have eaten my
morsel my self alone; and the fatherless
hath not eaten thereof; If I have seen
any perish for want of cloathing, or any
poor without covering.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 32. 32.</NOTE> The stranger did
not lodge in the street; but I opened my
doors to the traveller.</P>
<P>Such is a charitable man; the Sun is
<PB N="162" REF="85"/>
not more liberal of his light and warmth,
than he is of beneficial influence.</P>
<P>He doth not spare his substance, be∣ing
<HI>rich in good works, ready to distri∣bute,
willing to communicate;</HI> And where
his estate faileth, yet the contribution
of his endeavour will not be wanting;
he will be ready to draw and press others
to beneficence; so doing good not onely
according to his power, but in a man∣ner
beyond it, making the ability of
others to supply his own weakness, and
being liberal with their wealth. The
description of <HI>Cimon</HI> is a good character
of a charitable man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corn. Nep. <HI>(in</HI> Cimone.)</NOTE> <HI>Nulli fides ejus,
nulli opera, nulli res familiaris defuit.</HI></P>
<P>Thus may the poorest men be great
benefactours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">(1 Cor. 4. 11.)</NOTE> so the poor Apostles who
<HI>had nothing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6. 10.</NOTE> yet <HI>did enrich many;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> not
onely in spiritual treasure, but taking
care for supply of the poor, by their
precepts and moving exhortations; and
he that <HI>had not where to lay his head,</HI>
was the most bountifull person that ever
was;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 8. 9.</NOTE> <HI>for our sake he became poor, that
we by his poverty might be made rich.</HI></P>
<P>In all kinds charity disposeth to fur∣ther
our neighbours good, but especial∣ly
in the concerns of his soul; the which
as incomparably they do surpass all
<PB N="163" REF="85"/>
others, so it is the truest and noblest
charity to promote them.</P>
<P>It will incline us <HI>to draw forth our
soul to the hungry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 58. 7.—, 10.</NOTE> <HI>and to satisfie the af∣flicted
soul;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 18. 16.</NOTE> <HI>to bring the poor that are
cast out to our house; to cover the na∣ked,
to loose the bands of wickedness, to
undoe the heavy burthens, to let the op∣pressed
go free, to break every yoke;</HI> to
supply any corporal indigency, to re∣lieve
any temporal distress; but especial∣ly
it will induce to make provision for
the soul, to relieve the spiritual needs of
our neighbour; by affording him good
instruction, and taking care that he be
informed in his duty, or conducted in
his way to happiness; by admonition
and exhortation quickning, encoura∣ging,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
<HI>provoking,</HI> spurring him <HI>to good
works;</HI> by resolving him in his doubts,
and comforting him in his troubles of
conscience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10. 24.</NOTE> <HI>(lifting up the hands which
hang down and the feeble knees)</HI> by
seasonable and prudent reproof;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 12.</NOTE> by all
ways <HI>serving to convert him from the er∣rour
of his way;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> and so <HI>saving a soul
from death,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 14.</NOTE> <HI>and hiding a multitude of
sins;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 5. 20.</NOTE> which is the proper work of cha∣rity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 8.</NOTE>
for <HI>charity</HI> (saith Saint <HI>Peter) co∣vereth
a multitude of sins.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 10. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="86"/>
This was the charity of our <HI>Saviour,
He went about doing good,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 10. 38.</NOTE> healing the
bodily infirmities, <HI>(every sickness and
every disease among the people)</HI> satisfy∣ing
their bodily necessities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 4. 23. 9. 35.</NOTE> comforting
them in their worldly distresses, so far
as to perform great miracles for those
purposes (curing inveterate maladies,
restoring limbs and senses, raising the
dead, multiplying loaves and fishes) but
his charity was chiefly exercised in spi∣ritual
beneficence; in pourveying suste∣nance
and comfort for their souls, in
feeding their minds by wholsome in∣struction,
in curing their spiritual di∣stempers,
in correcting their ignorances
and errours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 14. 1. 15. 11.—16. 33.</NOTE> in exciting them to duty
by powerfull advices and exhortations,
in supporting them by heavenly conso∣lations
against temptations and troubles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 10.—</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus also did the charity of the holy
Apostles principally exert it self: they
did not neglect affording relief to the
outward needs of men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 3. 6. 5. 15, 16. 8. 7. 28. 8, 9.</NOTE> they did take
care by earnest intercession and exhor∣tation
for support of the poor;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 20. 35.—</NOTE> but espe∣cally
they did labour to promote the
spiritual benefit of men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 26.</NOTE> for this they<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 16. 1.</NOTE>
did undertake so many cares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 2. 10.</NOTE> and toils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 8. 7.—</NOTE>
and travels;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 9. 1.—</NOTE> for this they did undergo so<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 6. 18.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 13. 16.</NOTE>
<PB N="165" REF="86"/>
many hardships, so many hazards, so
many difficulties and trouble;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 10.</NOTE> <HI>There∣fore</HI>
(said Saint <HI>Paul) I endure all things
for the elects sake, that they may also ob∣tain
the salvation which is in Christ Je∣sus,
with eternal glory.</HI></P>
<P>X. This indeed is a property of Cha∣rity
to make a man deny himself, to
neglect his own interest, yea to despise
all selfish regards for the benefit of
his neighbour: to him that is inspi∣red
with charity his own good is not
good, when it standeth in competition
with the more considerable good of ano∣ther;
nothing is so dear to him, which
he gladly will not part with upon such
considerations.</P>
<P>Liberty is a precious thing, which
every man gladly would enjoy, yet how
little did Saint <HI>Paul</HI>'s charity regard it?
how absolutely did he abandon it for his
neighbours good?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Though</HI> (said he) <HI>I
am free from all men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 19.</NOTE> <HI>yet I have made
my self servant</HI> (or have enslaved my
self) <HI>unto all, that I might gain the
more:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 1. 12.—</NOTE> And he did express much satis∣faction
in the bonds which he bare for
the good of his brethren.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 3. 1,—13.</NOTE> <HI>I Paul</HI> (saith
he) <HI>the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you

Gentiles;</HI>—<HI>I suffer trouble as an evil
doer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>even unto bonds;—endure all
things for the Elects sake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Every man loveth his own humour
and would please himself; but the cha∣rity
of Saint</HI> Paul <HI>did rather chuse</HI> to
please all men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 33.</NOTE> making him all things to
all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 22.</NOTE> that by all means he might save
some; <HI>and the Rule he commended to
others, and imposed on himself was this,</HI>
We that are strong ought to bear the in∣firmities
of the weak,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 1.</NOTE> and not to please
our selves.</P>
<P><HI>Profit is the common mark of mens
designs and endeavours; but charity of∣ten
doth not aim thereat, but waveth it
for its neighbours advantage; for</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 8.</NOTE>
Aim not every man at his own
things, but every man also at the things
of others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. 24.</NOTE> <HI>is Saint</HI> Paul'<HI>s Rule; and,</HI> not
to seek his own profit, but the profit of
many, that they might be saved, <HI>was
his practice.</HI></P>
<P>To suffer is grievous to humane na∣ture,
and every man would shun it; but
charity not onely doth support it, but
joyeth in it, when it conduceth to its
neighbours advantage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 24.</NOTE> <HI>I rejoice,</HI> said
that charitable Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 1. 4, 6. 7. 4.</NOTE> <HI>in my sufferings
for you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="87"/>
Ease is a thing generally desirable
and acceptable; but charity doth part
with it, embracing labour, watchings,
travels, and troubles for the neighbours
good: upon this account did the holy
Apostles undertake <HI>abundant labours</HI> (as
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> telleth us) and <HI>to this end</HI>
(saith he) <HI>do I labour striving according
to his working,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 2. 9.</NOTE> <HI>which worketh in me
mightily;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess. 3. 8.</NOTE> to what end?<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 23. 6. 5.</NOTE> <HI>that we may
present every man perfect in Christ Je∣sus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—</NOTE>
this is that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1. 29.</NOTE> that <HI>la∣bour
of love,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 21. 31, 35.</NOTE> which they did commend
in others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6. 7.</NOTE> and so notably themselves ex∣ercise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Thess. 1. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Life of all things is held most preci∣ous
and dear; yet</HI> this <HI>charity upon ur∣gent
occasions will expose, will sacrifice
for its neighbours good;</HI> This <HI>(our Lord
telleth us)</HI> is the greatest love that any
man can express to his friend;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 15. 13.</NOTE> <HI>and the
highest instance that ever was of chari∣ty
was herein shewed; the imitation
whereof Saint</HI> John <HI>doth not doubt to
recommend to us;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3. 16.</NOTE> In this <HI>(saith he)</HI>
have we known the love of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 15. 12.</NOTE> because
he hath laid down his life for us; and
we ought to lay down our life for the
brethren;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 2.</NOTE> <HI>and Saint</HI> Paul, Walk in love,
even as Christ loved us, and gave him∣self
<PB N="168" REF="88"/>
for us an offering and sacrifice to
God; <HI>the which Precept he backed with
his own Example,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 12. 15.</NOTE> I <HI>(saith he)</HI> very glad∣ly
will spend and be spent for your souls;
<HI>and,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 17.</NOTE> If I be offered upon the sacrifice and
service of your faith, I joy and rejoice
with you all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 2. 8.</NOTE> <HI>and,</HI> Being affectionately
desirous of you, we were willing to have
imparted unto you, not the Gospel of God
onely, but also our own souls, because ye
were dear unto us.</P>
<P>Reputation to some is more dear than
life, and 'tis worse than death to be held
a malefactour, to be loaded with odious
reproaches, to have an infamous charac∣ter;
yet charity will engage men here∣to,
willingly to sustain the most grie∣vous
obloquy and disgrace; for this the
same heroical Apostles did pass through
<HI>honour and dishonour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6. 8.</NOTE> <HI>through evil report
and good report, as deceivers and yet
true</HI>—for this they <HI>were made a spec∣tacle
to the world,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4. 9, 10. 13.</NOTE> <HI>as fools, as weak, as
despicable;</HI>—were <HI>reviled, defamed,
made as the filth of the world, and off∣scouring
of all things.</HI> For this Saint <HI>Paul</HI>
was content to <HI>suffer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 9.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>as a
malefactour.</HI> So there was nothing which
charity will not deny it self, and lose
for the good of its neighbour.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="88"/>
XI. It is a property of Love not to
stand upon distinctions and nice respects,
but to be condescensive, and willing to
perform the meanest offices, needfull, or
usefull for the good of its friend.</P>
<P>He that truly loveth is a voluntary
servant, and gladly will stoop to any
imployment, for which the need, or
considerable benefit, of him whom he
loveth doth call.</P>
<P>So the greatest Souls, and the most
glorious Beings, the which are most en∣dewed
with Charity, by it are disposed
with greatest readiness to serve their in∣feriours.</P>
<P>This made Saint <HI>Paul</HI> constitute him∣self
<HI>a servant</HI> (we might render it a
Slave) <HI>of all men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 19.</NOTE> absolutely devoted to
the promoting their interests with his
utmost labour and diligence; underta∣king
toilsome drudgeries, running about
upon errands for them.</P>
<P>This maketh the blessed and glorious
Angels (the principalities and powers
above) vouchsafe to wait on men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 91. 11. 34. 7.</NOTE> to
be the guards of all good men, to be
ministring Spirits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 1. 7, 14.</NOTE> <HI>sent out to minister
for them, who shall inherit salvation;</HI>
not onely obedience to God enforceth
them, but charity disposeth them gladly
<PB N="170" REF="89"/>
to serve us, who are so much their in∣feriours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 15. 7, 10. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
the same charity, which pro∣duceth
joy in them at the conversion of
a sinner.</P>
<P>This made the Son of God to descend
from heaven;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 17. 5.</NOTE> and lay aside that <HI>glory
which he had with God before the world
was;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 8. 9.</NOTE> this made him, who was so <HI>rich,
to become poor, that we by his poverty
might be enriched;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 22. 27.</NOTE> this made him <HI>con∣verse</HI>
and demean himself among his
servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 20. 28.</NOTE> <HI>as he that ministred;</HI> this made
him to wash his Disciples feet; thereby
designing instructively to exemplifie the
duty and nature of Charity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 13. 14.</NOTE> for <HI>If</HI> (said
he) <HI>I your Lord and Master have washed
your feet, then ye also ought to wash one
anothers feet; for I have given you an
example, that ye should do as I have done
to you.</HI></P>
<P>This maketh God himself <HI>(the high
and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity.)</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 57. 15.</NOTE>
to condescend so far, as to be continual∣ly
employed in carefully watching over,
in providing for, in protecting, and as∣sisting
us vile and wretched <HI>worms;</HI> for
though <HI>he dwelleth on high,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 113. 6.</NOTE> <HI>yet humbleth
he himself to behold the things that are
in heaven and earth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">(Psal. 8. 4. 144. 3. Job. 7. 17.)</NOTE> This maketh him
with so much pain and patience to sup∣port
<PB N="171" REF="89"/>
our infirmities, to bear with our
offences, to wait for our conversion;
according to that Protestation in the
Prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 43. 24.</NOTE> <HI>Thou hast made me to serve
with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with
thine iniquities.</HI></P>
<P>In conformity to this wonderfull prac∣tice,
whose actions are the best rules and
patterns of our deportment, charity
should dispose us, according to Saint
<HI>Paul</HI>'s practice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 13.</NOTE> <HI>by love to serve one
another.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed it will not suffer any man to
look down on another with supercilious
contempt or neglect; as if he were un∣worthy
or beneath our regard. It will
incline superiours to look on their infe∣riours
(their subjects, their servants, their
meanest and poorest neighbours) not as
beasts or as slaves; but as men, as bre∣thren;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 31. 13, 14, 15.</NOTE>
as descending from the same
stock, as partakers of the common na∣ture
and reason;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 1. 1.</NOTE> as those <HI>who have ob∣tained
the like precious faith;</HI> as heirs
of the same precious promises and glo∣rious
hopes; as their equals in the best
things, and in all considerable advanta∣ges;
equals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eph. 6. 9. Col. 4. 1.</NOTE> in God's sight, and accor∣ding
to our Lord's intent, when he
said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 23. 9.</NOTE> <HI>One is your Master, even Christ, and
<PB N="172" REF="90"/>
all ye are brethren;</HI> according to Saint
<HI>Paul</HI>'s exhortation to <HI>Philemon,</HI> that he
would receive <HI>Onesimus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philem. 16.</NOTE> <HI>not now as a ser∣vant,
but above a servant, a brother be∣loved
in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly charity will dispose men
of rank in their behaviour to be conde∣scensive,
lowly, meek, courteous, obli∣ging
and helpfull to those, who in hu∣mane
eye or in worldly state are most
below them; remembring that ordi∣nance
of our Lord, charged on all his
Disciples, and enforced by his own pat∣tern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 23. 11.</NOTE>
<HI>He that is greatest among you let
him be your servant.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 22. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>Love indeed is the great Leveller,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amicitia pa∣res invenit, aut facit.</NOTE>
which in a manner setteth all things on
even ground, and reduceth to a just
poise; which bringeth down heaven to
earth, and raiseth up earth to heaven;
which inclineth the highest to wait
upon the lowest, which ingageth the
strength of the mightiest to help the
weakest, and the wealth of the richest
to supply the poorest, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
that <HI>there may be an equality;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor. 8. 14.</NOTE> that no
where there may be an useless abundance,
or a helpless indigence.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="90"/>
XII. Charity doth regulate our dea∣ling,
our deportment, our conversation
toward our neighbour, implying good
usage, and fair treatment of him on all
occasions; for no man doth handle that
which he loveth rudely or roughly, so
as to endanger the loss, the detriment, the
hurt or offence thereof.</P>
<P>Wherefore the language of charity is
soft and sweet, not wounding the heart,
not grating on the ear of any with
whom a man converseth; like the lan∣guage
of which the Wise man saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 15. 26.</NOTE> <HI>The
words of the pure are pleasant words</HI>—;
such as are <HI>sweet to the soul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 16. 24.</NOTE> <HI>and health

it is a certain argument of his defect in

conceits, and those humours, from whence
such practice doth issue.</P>
<P><HI>Charity</HI> (saith Saint <HI>Paul)</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>behaveth not it self unhandsomely;</HI> is not
untoward, unseemly, uncivil, or clow∣nish
in word, or in carriage, or in deed;
It is in truth the most civilizing, and
most polishing disposition that can be:
Nothing doth render a man so compleat∣ly
Gentile; (not in an affected, or arti∣ficial
way, consisting in certain postures
or motions of body; (dopping, crin∣ging,
<HI>&amp;c.)</HI> in forms of expression, or
modish addresses, which men learn like
Parrots, and vent by rote, usually not
meaning any thing by them, often with
them disguising fraud and rancour) but
in a real and natural manner, suggested
by good judgment and hearty affection.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="91"/>
A charitable man may perhaps not
be guilty of courtship, or may be un∣practised
in the modes of address; but
he will not be deficient in the substance
of paying every man proper and due re∣spect:
this indeed is true courtesie,
grounded on reason, and proceeding
from the heart, which therefore is far
more genuine, more solid, more steady,
than that which is built on fashion and
issueth from affectation; the which in∣deed
onely doth ape, or counterfeit the
deportment of charity; for what a cha∣ritable
man truly is, that a gallant would
seem to be.</P>
<P>Such are the properties of Charity.</P>
<P>There be also further many particu∣lar
Acts, which have a very close alli∣ance
to it; being ever coherent with it,
or springing from it; which are recom∣mended
to us by precepts in the holy
Scripture; the which it will be conveni∣ent
to mention.</P>
<P>1. It is a proper act of Charity to
forbear anger upon provocation, or to
repress its motions, to resent injuries
and discourtesies either not at all, or
very calmly and mildly: for</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="92"/>
<HI>Charity</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 5.</NOTE> is not easily
provoked.</P>
<P><HI>Charity</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">V. 4.</NOTE> suffereth long
and is kind.</P>
<P><HI>Charity</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">V. 7.</NOTE> doth endure
all things.</P>
<P>Anger is a violent insurrection of the
mind against a person; but love is not
apt to rise up in opposition against any;
anger is an intemperate heat, love hath
a pure warmth quite of another nature;
as natural heat is from a feaver; or as
the heat of the Sun from that of a culi∣nary
fire; which putteth that out, as
the Sun-beams do extinguish a culinary
fire; anger hath an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>an ap∣petite
of revenge,</HI> or doing mischief to
the object of it; but love is innocent
<HI>and worketh no evil.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Love disposeth, if our neighbour doth
misbehave himself toward us (by wrong∣full
usage, or unkind carriage) to be sor∣ry
for him, and to pity him; which are
passions contrary to anger, and slaking
the violences of it.</P>
<P>It is said in the <HI>Canticles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 8. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Many wa∣ters
cannot quench love, neither can the
flouds drown it;</HI> charity would hold out
against many neglects, many provoca∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="92"/>
<HI>Hence the Precepts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> Walk with all
lowliness, and meekness, with long-suffe∣ring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 1, 2.</NOTE>
forbearing one another in love:
Let all bitterness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 31.</NOTE> and wrath, and anger,
and clamour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 1. 14. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> and evil-speaking be put

anger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 1. 19.</NOTE> wrath, malice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be slow to
wrath.</P>
<P>2. It is a proper Act of Charity to
remit offences, suppressing all designs of
revenge, and not retaining any grudge:
for,</P>
<P><HI>Charity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 7▪</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>doth cover all
things;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 10. 12.</NOTE> and in this sense doth <HI>hide a
multitude of sins:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 8.</NOTE> all dispositions, all in∣tents
to do harm are inconsistent with
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 5. 20.</NOTE> are quite repugnant to it.</P>
<P><HI>Hence those Precepts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 12, 13.</NOTE> Put on, as the
elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
mercies, kindnesse, humblenesse of mind,
meeknesse, long suffering, forbearing one
another, and forgiving one another, if
any man hath a quarrel against any,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> even
as Christ forgave you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 32.</NOTE> so also do ye: Be
ye kind one to another, tender-hearted,
forgiving one another; even as God for
Christ's sake hath forgiven you:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 15.</NOTE> See that
none render evil for evil, but ever follow
that which is good both among your selves
and to all men:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>And many the like Pre∣cepts
<PB N="178" REF="93"/>
occur in the Gospels,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 17.</NOTE> <HI>the Aposto∣lical
Writings;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 6. 14. 5. 44.</NOTE> <HI>yea even in the old Te∣stament,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 20. 22. 25. 21.</NOTE>
<HI>wherein charity did not run in
so high a strain.</HI></P>
<P>3. It is a Duty coherent with Chari∣ty,
to maintain concord and peace; to
abstain from contention and strife; to∣gether
with the sources of them, pride,
envy, emulation, malice.</P>
<P>We are commanded to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 2.</NOTE> <HI>of one soul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3. 8.</NOTE> <HI>of one mind</HI>

we should <HI>all speak the same thing, and
that there be no divisions among us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3. 16.</NOTE> <HI>but
that we be perfectly joined together in
the same mind, and in the same judg∣ment:</HI>
that there be no factions, or
<HI>schismes in the body:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12. 25. 11. 18. 1. 11. 3. 3.</NOTE> that all dissensions,
all clamours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 12. 20.</NOTE> all murmurings, all emulati∣ons
should be abandoned and put away
from us;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 14.</NOTE> that we should <HI>pursue and
maintain peace with all men:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 14.</NOTE> obedience
to which commands can onely be the
result of charity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 18.</NOTE> esteeming the person
and judgment of our neighbour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 22.</NOTE> desiring
<PB N="179" REF="93"/>
his good-will, tendring his good; cur∣bing
those fleshly lusts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 4. 1.</NOTE> and those fierce
passions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3. 3.</NOTE> from the predominancy where∣of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 20.</NOTE>
discords and strifes do spring.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 6. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>4. Another charitable practice is be∣ing
candid in opinion, and mild in cen∣sure
about our neighbour, and his acti∣ons;
having a good conceit of his per∣son
and representing him to our selves
under the best character we can; ma¦king
the most favourable construction
of his words, and the fairest interpreta∣tion
of his designs.</P>
<P>Charity disposeth us to entertain a
good opinion of our neighbour, for de∣siring
his good we shall be concerned
for him, and prejudiced (as it were) on
his side; being unwilling to discover
any blemish in him to our own disap∣pointment
and regret.</P>
<P>Love cannot subsist without esteem;
and it would not willingly by destroy∣ing
that lose its own subsistence.</P>
<P>Love would preserve any good of its
friend, and therefore his reputation,
which is a good in it self precious, and
ever very dear to him.</P>
<P>Love would bestow any good, and
therefore its esteem; which is a conside∣rable
good.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="94"/>
Harsh censure is a very rude kind of
treatment, grievously vexing a man, and
really hurting him; charity therefore
will not be guilty of it.</P>
<P>It disposeth rather to oversee, and
connive at faults, than to find them, or
to pore on them, rather to hide and
smother, than to disclose or divulge them;
rather to extenuate and excuse, than to
exaggerate or aggravate them.</P>
<P>Are words capable of a good sense?
charity will expound them thereto: may
an action be imputed to any good intent?
charity will ever refer it thither: doth a
fault admit any plea, apology, or dimi∣nution?
charity will be sure to allege it:
may a quality admit a good name? cha∣rity
will call it thereby.</P>
<P>It doth not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 5.</NOTE> <HI>not im∣pute
evil,</HI> or put it to any man's ac∣compt,
beyond absolute necessity.</P>
<P>It <HI>hopeth all things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 7.</NOTE> and <HI>believeth all
things;</HI> hopeth and believeth all things
for the best in favour to its neighbour,
concerning his intentions, and actions,
liable to doubt.</P>
<P>It banisheth <HI>all evil surmises;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 6. 4.</NOTE> it re∣jecteth
all ill stories, malicious insinua∣tions,
perverse glosses and descants.</P>
<P>5. Another charitable practice is to
<PB N="181" REF="94"/>
comport with the infirmities of our
neighbour; according to that Rule of
Saint <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>We that are strong ought to
bear the infirmities of the weak,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 20. 35.</NOTE> <HI>and not
to please our selves;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 14.</NOTE> and that Precept,
<HI>Bear one anothers burthens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15. 1.</NOTE> <HI>and so fulfill
the law of Christ.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Is a man wiser than his neighbour,
(or in any case freer of defects) charity
will dispose to use that advantage so as
not to contemn him, or insult over him;
but to instruct him, to help him, to com∣fort
him.</P>
<P>As we deal with children, allowing
to the infirmities of their age, bearing
their ignorance, frowardness, untoward
humours, without distasting them; so
should we with our brethren who labour
under any weakness of mind or humour.</P>
<P>6. 'Tis an act of charity to abstain from
offending, or scandalizing our brethren;
by doing any thing, which either may
occasion him to commit sin, or disaffect
him to Religion, or discourage him
in the practice of duty, (that which
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> calleth to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 1 Cor. 10. 7. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 1 Cor. 8. 12.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>HEBREWS 10. 24.</BIBL>
<Q>Let us consider one another to provoke
unto love, and to good works.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT which is here recommen∣ded
by the Apostle, as the com∣mon
Duty of Christians toward
each other, upon emergent occasions, with
zeal and care to provoke one another to
the practice of Charity and Beneficence,
may well be conceived the special Duty
of those, whose Office it is to instruct
and guide others, when opportunity is
afforded: with that obligation I shall
now comply, by representing divers con∣siderations
serving to excite and encou∣rage
us to that practice: this (without
premising any description or explication
of the Duty; the Nature, special Acts
and Properties whereof I have already
declared) I shall immediately undertake,</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="96"/>
I. First then, I desire you to remem∣ber
and consider that you are men, and
as such obliged to this Duty; as being
very agreeable to humane nature; the
which (not being corrupted, or distem∣pered
by ill use) doth incline to it, doth
call for it, doth like and approve it,
doth find satisfaction and delight there∣in.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Paul</HI> chargeth us to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 10.</NOTE>
or <HI>to have a natural af∣fection
one toward another;</HI> that suppo∣seth
a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> inbred to men, which should
be rowsed up, improved, and exercised:
Such an one indeed there is, which al∣though
often raked up and smothered in
the common attendances on the provi∣ding
for our needs, and prosecuting our
affairs, will upon occasion, more or less
break forth and discover it self.</P>
<P>That the constitution and frame of
our nature disposeth to it, we cannot
but feel, when our bowels are touched
with a sensible pain at the view of any
calamitous object, when our fancies are
disturbed at the report of any disaster
befalling a man;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Arist. <HI>Eth.</HI> 9. 9.</NOTE> when the sight of a
Tragedy wringeth compassion and tears
from us; which affections we can hard∣ly
quash by any reflection, that such
<PB N="185" REF="96"/>
events (true or feigned) do not concern
our selves.</P>
<P>Hence doth nature so
strongly affect society,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hominem homini natura conciliat. <HI>Sen.</HI> Ep. 9.</NOTE> and
abhor solitude; so that a
man cannot enjoy himself
alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nullius boni sine socio ju∣cunda possessio est. <HI>Sen.</HI> Ep. 6.</NOTE> or find satisfaction in
any good without a compa∣nion;
not onely for that he
then cannot receive,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 25.</NOTE> but al∣so
because he cannot impart
assistance, consolation and de∣light
in converse; for men do
not affect society onely that
they may obtain benefits
thereby; but as much or
more, that they may be en∣abled
to communicate them; nothing
being more distastefull than to be al∣ways
on the taking hand: neither in∣deed
hath any thing a more pleasant and
savoury relish than to do Good; as even
<HI>Epicurus,</HI> the great Patron of pleasure
did confess.</P>
<P>The practice of benignity, of cour∣tesy,
of clemency do at first sight, with∣out
aid of any discursive reflection, ob∣tain
approbation and applause from men;
being acceptable and amiable to their
mind, as beauty to their sight, harmony
<PB N="186" REF="97"/>
to their hearing, fragrancy to their smell
and sweetness to their taste; And corre∣spondently
uncharitable dispositions and
practices (malignity, harshness, cruelty)
do offend the mind<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a disgustfull
resentment of them.</P>
<P>We may appeal to the conscience of
each man if he doth not feel dissatisfacti∣on
in that fierceness or frowardness of
temper, which produceth uncharitable∣ness;
if we have not a complacence in
that sweet and calm disposition of soul,
whence charity doth issue; if he do not
condemn himself for the one, and ap∣prove
himself in the other practice.</P>
<P>This is the common judgment of
men;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Flavian. CP. <HI>Ep. in Syn.</HI> Chalc. <HI>Act. 1. (p. III.)</HI></NOTE> and therefore in common lan∣guage
this practice is styled humanity,
as best sorting with our nature, and be∣coming
it; and the principle whence it
springeth is called good nature; and the
contrary practice is styled inhumanity,
as thwarting our natural inclinations,
or devesting us of manhood; and its
source likewise is termed ill-nature, or
a corruption of our nature.</P>
<P>It is therefore a monstrous paradox,
crossing the common sense of men,
which in this loose and vain world hath
lately got such vogue, that all men na∣turally
<PB N="187" REF="97"/>
are enemies one to another: it
pretendeth to be grounded on common
observation and experience; but it is
onely an observing the worst actions of
the worst men; of dissolute ruffians, of
villainous cheats, of ravenous oppressours,
of malicious politicians, of such degene∣rate
Apostates from humanity; by whose
practice (debauched by vain conceits
and naughty customs) an ill measure is
taken of mankind: <HI>Aristotle</HI> himself,
who had observed things as well as any
of these men and with as
sharp a judgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Arist.</HI> Eth. 8. 1. Rhet. 1. 11.</NOTE> affirmeth
the contrary, that all men
are friends, and disposed to
entertain friendly correspon∣dence
with one another:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys. <HI>in</HI> Eph. <HI>Orat.</HI> 2.</NOTE> In∣deed
to say the contrary is
a blasphemy against the Au∣thour
of our nature; and is
spoken no less out of profane
enmity against him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Pro∣clus Constantinopl. <HI>Syn.</HI> Chalc. <HI>Act.</HI> 14.</NOTE> than
out of venomous malignity
against men: out of hatred
to God and Goodness they
would disparage and vilifie
the noblest work of God's Creation;
yet do they (if we sound the bottom
of their mind) imply themselves to ad∣mire
<PB N="188" REF="98"/>
this quality, and by their decrying
it do commend it; for it is easie to dis∣cern
that therefore onely they slander
mankind as uncapable of goodness, be∣cause
out of malignity they would not
allow it so excellent a quality.</P>
<P>II. Let us consider what our neigh∣bour
is, how near in bloud, how like
in nature, how much in all considerable
respects the same with us he is.</P>
<P>Should any one wrong or defame our
brother, we should be displeased; should
we do it our selves, or should we omit
any office of kindness toward him, we
should blame our selves; Every man is
such, of one stock, of one bloud with
us; and as such may challenge and call
for real affection from us.</P>
<P>Should any one mar, tear, or deface
our Picture, or shew any kind of disre∣spect
thereto, we should be offended,
taking it for an indignity put on our
selves; and as for our selves we should
never in such a manner affront or de∣spight
our selves;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Plato <HI>Symp.</HI></NOTE> Every man is such, our
most lively image, representing us most
exactly in all the main figures and fea∣tures
of body, of soul, of state; we thence
do owe respect to every one.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="98"/>
Every man is another self, partaker of
the same nature, endewed with the same
faculties, subject to the same Laws, li∣able
to the same fortunes; distinguished
from us onely in accidental, and vari∣able
circumstances; whence if we be
amiable or estimable, so is he upon the
same grounds; and acting impartially
(according to right judgment) we should
yield love and esteem to him: by sligh∣ting,
hating, injuring, hurting him we
do consequentially abuse our selves, or
acknowledge our selves deservedly liable
to the same usage.</P>
<P>Every man as a Christian, is in a
higher and nobler way allied, assimila∣ted,
and identified to us; to him there∣fore
upon the like grounds improved
charity is more due; and we wrong our
heavenly relations, our better nature,
our more considerable selves, in with∣holding
it from him.</P>
<P>III. Equity doth plainly require Cha∣rity
from us; for every one is ready not
onely to wish and seek, but to demand
and claim love from others; so as to be
much offended, and grievously to com∣plain
if he do not find it.</P>
<P>We do all conceive love and respect
<PB N="190" REF="99"/>
due to us from all men; we take all men
bound to wish and tender our welfare,
we suppose our need to require commi∣seration
and succour from every man;
if it be refused, we think it a hard case,
and that we are ill used; we cry out of
wrong, of discourtesie, of inhumanity,
of baseness practised toward us.</P>
<P>A moderate respect and affection will
hardly satisfie us, we pretend to them
in the highest degree, disgusting the
least appearance of disregard or disaffec∣tion;
we can scarce better digest indif∣ference
than hatred.</P>
<P>This evidenceth our opinion and con∣science
to be, that we ought to pay the
greatest respect and kindness to our
neighbour; for it is plainly unjust and
ridiculously vain, to require that from
others, which we refuse to others, who
may demand it upon the same title; nor
can we without self-condemnation prac∣tice
that which we detest in others.</P>
<P>In all reason and equity, if I would
have another my friend, I must be a
friend to him; if I pretend to charity
from all men, I must render it to all in
the same kind and measure.</P>
<P>Hence is the Law of Charity well
expressed in those terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 7.</NOTE> <HI>of doing to
<PB N="191" REF="99"/>
others whatever we would have them do
to us;</HI> whereby the palpable equity of
this practice is demonstrated.</P>
<P>IV. Let us consider, that Charity is
a right noble and worthy thing; great∣ly
perfective of our nature, much dig∣nifying
and beautifying our soul.</P>
<P>It rendreth a man truly great, enlar∣ging
his mind unto a vast circumference,
and to a capacity near infinite; so that
it by a general care doth reach all things;
by an universal affection doth embrace
and grasp the world.</P>
<P>By it our reason obtaineth a field, or
scope of employment worthy of it, not
confined to the slender interests of one
person or one place, but extending to
the concerns of all men.</P>
<P>Charity is the imitation and copy of
that immense love,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrys. <HI>in</HI> Eph. <HI>Or.</HI> 9.</NOTE> which is the foun∣tain
of all being and all good; which
made all things, which preserveth the
world, which sustaineth eve∣ry
creature;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Naz. <HI>Or.</HI> 14.</NOTE> Nothing advan∣ceth
us so near to a resem∣blance
of him, who is essen∣tial
love and goodness; who
freely and purely, without
any regard to his own ad∣vantage,
<PB N="192" REF="100"/>
or capacity of finding any be∣neficial
return, doth bear and express
the highest good-will, with a liberal
hand pouring down showers of bounty
and mercy on all his crea∣tures:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Chrys. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
who daily putteth up
numberless indignities and
injuries; upholding and main∣taining
those who offend and
provoke him.</P>
<P>Charity rendereth us as Angels, or
Peers to those glorious and blessed Crea∣tures,
who without receiving or expec∣ting
any requital from us, do heartily
desire and delight in our good, are rea∣dy
to promote it, do willingly serve and
labour for it. Nothing is more amiable,
more admirable, more venerable even
in the common eye and opinion of men;
it hath in it a beauty and a majesty apt
to ravish every heart: Even a spark of
it in generosity of dealing breedeth ad∣miration,
a glimpse of it in formal cour∣tesie
of behaviour procureth much e∣steem,
being deemed to accomplish and
adorn a man; how lovely therefore
and truly gallant is an entire, sincere,
constant, and uniform practice thereof,
issuing from pure good-will and affec∣tion!</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="100"/>
Love indeed or goodness (for true
love is nothing else but goodness exer∣ting
it self, in direction toward objects
capable of its influence) is the onely
amiable, and onely honourable thing:
Power and Wit may be admired by
some, or have some fond Idolaters; but
being severed from goodness, or abstrac∣ted
from their subserviency to it, they
cannot obtain real love, they deserve
not any esteem; for the worst, the most
unhappy, the most odious and contemp∣tible
of Beings do partake of them in a
high measure: The Prince of Darkness
hath more power; and reigneth with
absolute Sovereignty over more Subjects
by many than the <HI>Great Turk;</HI> One
Devil may have more wit than all the
politick <HI>Achitophels,</HI> and all the profane
<HI>Hectors</HI> in the world; yet with all his
Power and all his Wit he is most wret∣ched,
most detestable, and most despi∣cable:
and such in proportion is every
one, who partaketh in his accursed dis∣positions
of malice and uncharitableness.
For,</P>
<P>On the other side Uncharitableness is
a very mean and base thing:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sen.</HI> de Tranq. 3.</NOTE> It contrac∣teth
a mans soul into a narrow compass,
or streightneth it as it were into one
<PB N="194" REF="101"/>
point; drawing all his thoughts, his de∣sires,
his affections into himself, as to
their centre; so that his reason, his will,
his activity have but one pitifull object
to exercise themselves about: To scrape
together a little pelf, to catch a vapour
of fame, to progg for a frivolous sem∣blance
of power or dignity, to sooth
the humour, or pamper the sensuality
of one poor worm, is the ignoble subject
of his busie care and endeavour.</P>
<P>By it we debase our selves into an affi∣nity
with the meanest things; becoming
either like Beasts or Fiends; like Beasts,
affecting onely our own present sensible
good; or like Fiends, designing mischief
and trouble to others.</P>
<P>It is indeed hard for a man without
Charity, not to be worse than an inno∣cent
Beast; not at least to be as a Fox,
or a Wolf;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 22. 27.</NOTE> either cunningly lurching,
or violently ravening for prey: Love
onely can restrain a man from flying at
all, and seising on whatever he meeteth;
from biting, from worrying, from de∣vouring
every one that is weaker than
himself, or who cannot defend himself
from his paws and teeth.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="101"/>
V. The practice of Charity is pro∣ductive
of many great benefits and ad∣vantages
to us; so that to love our
neighbour doth involve the truest love
to our selves; and we are not onely ob∣liged
in duty, but may be encouraged
by our interest thereto: Beatitude is of∣ten
pronounced to it, or to some parti∣cular
instances of it; and well may it
be so, for it indeed will constitute a
man happy, producing to him manifold
comforts and conveniencies of life:
some whereof we shall touch.</P>
<P>VI. (1.) Charity doth free our souls
of all those bad dispositions and passions
which vex and disquiet them;
from those gloomy passions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Orat.</HI> 32.</NOTE>
which cloud our mind, from
those keen passions, which
fret our heart, from those
tumultuous passions, which
ruffle us and discompose the
frame of our soul.</P>
<P>It stifleth anger, (that swoon of rea∣son,
transporting a man out of himself)
for a man hardly can be incensed against
those whom he tenderly loveth: a petty
neglect, a hard word, a small discour∣tesie
will not fire a charitable soul; the
<PB N="196" REF="102"/>
greatest affront or wrong can hardly
kindle rage therein.</P>
<P>It banisheth envy (that severely just
vice, which never faileth to
punish it self) for no man
will repine at his wealth or
prosperity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Gr. Naz. <HI>Orat.</HI> 27.</NOTE> no man will ma∣lign
his worth or vertue,
whose good he charitably
desireth and wisheth.</P>
<P>It excludeth rancour and spite, those
dispositions which create a hell in our
soul; which are directly repugnant to
charity, and thereby dispelled as dark∣ness
by light, cold by heat.</P>
<P>It suffereth not revenge (that canker
of the heart) to harbour in our breast;
for who can intend mischief to him, in
whose good he delighteth, in whose evil
he feeleth displeasure?</P>
<P>It voideth fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 4. 18.</NOTE> suspicion, jealousie of
mischief designed against us;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> the which
passions <HI>have torment,</HI> or do punish us
(as Saint <HI>John</HI> saith) racking us with
anxious expectation of evil; wherefore
<HI>there is,</HI> saith he, <HI>no fear in love, but
perfect love casteth out fear:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oderunt quem metuunt.</NOTE> No man
indeed is apt to fear him whom he lo∣veth,
or is able much to love him whom
he feareth; for love esteemeth its object
<PB N="197" REF="102"/>
as innocent, fear apprehendeth it as hurt∣full;
love disposeth to follow and em∣brace,
fear inclineth to decline and shun:
To suspect a friend therefore is to disa∣vow
him for such; and upon slender
grounds to conceit ill of him, is to deem
him unworthy of our love: The inno∣cence
and inoffensiveness of charity,
which provoketh no man to do us harm,
doth also breed great security and con∣fidence;
any man will think he may
walk unarmed and unguarded among
those to whom he beareth good-will, to
whom he neither meaneth, nor doeth any
harm; being guarded by a good consci∣ence
and shielded with innocence.</P>
<P>It removeth discontent or dissatisfac∣tion
in our state; the which usually doth
spring from ill conceits and surmises
about our neighbour, or from wrathfull
and spitefull affections toward him; for
while men have good respect and kind∣ness
for their neighbours, they seldom
are dissatisfied in their own condition;
they can never want comfort or despair
of succour.</P>
<P>It curbeth ambition and avarice; those
impetuous, those insatiable, those trouble∣some
dispositions; for a man will not af∣fect
to climb above those, in whose ho∣nour
<PB N="198" REF="103"/>
he findeth satisfaction; nor to
scramble with them for the goods, which
he gladly would have them to enjoy: a
competency will satisfie him who taketh
himself but for one among the rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 32.</NOTE> and
who can as little endure to see others
want as himself: who would trouble
himself to get power over those, to o're∣top
them in dignity and fame, to sur∣pass
them in wealth, whom he is ready
to serve in the meanest offices of kind∣ness,
whom he would in honour pre∣fer
to himself, unto whom he will libe∣rally
communicate what he hath, for his
comfort and relief?</P>
<P>In the prevalence of such bad passions
and dispositions of soul our misery doth
most consist; thence the chief troubles
and inconveniencies of our life do pro∣ceed;
wherefore charity doth highly
deserve of us in freeing us from them.</P>
<P>VII. (2.) It consequently doth settle
our mind in a serene, calm, sweet, and
cheerfull state; in an even temper and
good humour, and harmonious order of
soul, which ever will result from the
evacuation of bad passions, from the
composure of such as are indifferent,
from the excitement of those which are
<PB N="199" REF="103"/>
good and pleasant:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 22.</NOTE> <HI>The fruits of the Spi∣rit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5. 12.</NOTE>
saith Saint <HI>Paul, are love, joy, peace,
long-suffering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3. 12.</NOTE> <HI>gentleness, goodness</HI> (or be∣nignity):
love precedeth, joy and peace
follow as its<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eldest Daughter.</NOTE> constant attendants, gentle∣ness
and benignity come after as its cer∣tain
effects.</P>
<P>Love indeed is the sweetest of all pas∣sions,
ever accompanied with a secret
delectation and pleasant sense; when∣ever
it is placed upon a good object,
when it acteth in a rational way, when
it is vigorous, it must needs yield much
joy.</P>
<P>It therefore greatly conduceth to our
happiness, or rather alone doth suffice to
constitute us happy.</P>
<P>VIII. (3.) Charity will preserve us
from divers external mischiefs and incon∣veniencies,
to which our life is expo∣sed,
and which otherwise we shall in∣cur.</P>
<P>If we have not charity toward men,
we shall have enmity with them; and
upon that do wait troops of mischief;
we shall enjoy nothing quietly or safe∣ly,
we shall do nothing without opposi∣tion
or contention; no conversation, no
commerce will be pleasant; clamour,
<PB N="200" REF="104"/>
obloquy, tumult, and trouble will sur∣round
us; we shall live in perpetual dan∣ger;
the enmity of the meanest and
weakest Creature being formidable.</P>
<P>But all such mischiefs charity will pre∣vent
or remove; damming
up the fountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Clem.</HI> Str. 7. (p. 532.)</NOTE> or extirpa∣ting
the roots of them: for
who will hate a person that
apparently loveth him; who
can be so barbarous or base
as to hurt that man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Thess. <HI>Or.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c.</NOTE> whom
he findeth ever ready to do
himself good? what brute,
what devil can find in his
heart to be a foe to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Hier.</NOTE> who
is a sure friend to all?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys. <HI>in</HI> Gen. <HI>Or.</HI> 32.</NOTE> No
Publican can be so wretched∣ly
vile, no sinner so destitute
of goodness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 46.</NOTE> for, <HI>If</HI> (saith our Lord,
upon common experience) <HI>you love them
which love you, what reward have you,
do not even the publicans the same?</HI> and,
<HI>If you do good to them which do good to
you, what thank have you? for sinners
also do even the same:</HI> It seemeth be∣yond
the greatest degeneracy and cor∣ruption
whereof humane nature is ca∣pable,
to requite charity with enmity,
yea not to return some kindness for it:
<PB N="201" REF="104"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3. 13. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Who</HI> (saith Saint <HI>Peter)
is he that will do you hurt, if you be fol∣lowers
of that which is good;</HI> or imita∣tours
of him that is good; (of the Sove∣reign
goodness)? none surely can be so
unjust, or so unworthy.</P>
<P>As charity restraineth us from doing
any wrong, or yielding any offence to
others in thought, in word, in deed;
from entertaining any bad conceits with∣out
ground, from hatching any mischie∣vous
designs against our neighbour;
from using any harsh, virulent, biting
language; from any rugged, discourte∣ous,
disobliging behaviour; from any
wrongfull, rigorous, severe dealing to∣ward
him; from any contemptuous
pride, or supercilious arrogance; so it
consequently will defend us from the
like treatment; for scarce any man is so
malicious as without any provocation to
do mischief;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vincit malos pertinax bo∣nitas. <HI>Sen.</HI></NOTE> no man is so incorrigibly
savage, as to persist in committing out∣rage
upon perfect innocence, joined with
patience, with meekness, with courtesie:
Charity surely will melt the hardest
heart, and charm the fiercest spirit; it
will bind the most violent hand, it will
still the most obstreperous tongue; it
will reconcile the most offended, most
<PB N="202" REF="105"/>
prejudiced heart:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carbones ignis congregabis super caput ejus; non in male∣dictum &amp; condemnationem, ut plerique existimant, sed in correctionem &amp; poenitudinem; ut superatus beneficiis, ex∣coctus fervore charitatis, ini∣micus esse desistat. <HI>Hier.</HI> in <HI>Pelag.</HI> 1. cap. 9.</NOTE> it is the
best guard that can be of
our safety from assaults, of
our interest from dammage,
of our reputation from slan∣der,
detraction, and re∣proach.</P>
<P>If you would have Examples of this,
experience will afford many; and some
we have in the Sacred Records commen∣ded
to our Observation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 32. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Esau</HI> was a
rough man, and one who had been ex∣ceedingly
provoked by his brother <HI>Ja∣cob;</HI>
yet how did meek and respectfull
demeanour overcome him! so that <HI>Esau</HI>
(it is said in the history) <HI>ran to meet him
(Iacob),</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 33. 4.</NOTE> <HI>and fell on his neck, and kissed
him, and they wept.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saul</HI> was a man possessed with a fu∣rious
envy and spite against <HI>David;</HI> yet
into what expressions did the sense of
his kind dealing force him!<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 24. 16, 17. 26. 17, 21.</NOTE> <HI>Is this thy
voice, my Son David?—Thou art more
righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded
me good, whereas I have rewarded thee
evil;—behold I have played the fool,
and have erred exceedingly.</HI> So doth
charity subdue and triumph over the
most inveterate prejudices, and the most
violent passions of men.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="105"/>
If peace and quiet be desirable things,
as certainly they are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cadit statim simultas ab altera parte deserta.—<HI>Sen.</HI> de Ir. 2. 34.</NOTE> and that form im∣plyeth,
when by wishing peace with
men, we are understood to wish all good
to them, it is charity onely that preserveth
them; which more surely than any
power or policy doth quash all war and
strife; for war must have parties, and
strife implieth resistance; be it the first
or second blow which maketh the fray,
charity will avoid it; for it neither will
strike the first in offence, nor the second
in revenge. Charity therefore may well
be styled <HI>the band of peace,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 3.</NOTE> it being that
onely which can knit mens souls toge∣ther,
and keep them from breaking out
into dissensions.</P>
<P>It alone is that, which will prevent
bickering and clashing about points of
credit or interest; if we love not our
neighbour, or tender not his good as our
own, we shall be ever in competition
and debate with him about those things,
not suffering him to enjoy any thing
quietly; struggling to get above him,
scrambling with him for what is to be had.</P>
<P>IX. (4.) As charity preserveth from
mischiefs, so it procureth many sweet
comforts and fair accommodations of life.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="106"/>
Friendship is a most usefull and plea∣sant
thing; and charity will conciliate
good store thereof; it is apt to make all
men friends:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ego tibi mon∣strabo amato∣rium sine me∣dicamento, sine herba, sine ullius ve∣neficae carmi∣ne, Si vis a∣mari, ama. <HI>Sen.</HI> Ep. 9.</NOTE> for love is the onely gene∣ral
philtre, and effectual charm of souls;
the fire which kindleth all it toucheth,
and propagateth it self in every capable
subject; and such a subject is every man
in whom humanity is not quite extinct,
and hardly can any such man be, seeing
every man hath some good humour in
him, some bloud, some kindly juice flow∣ing
in his veins; no man wholly doth
consist of dusky melancholy, or fiery
choler; whence all men may be presumed
liable to the powerfull impressions of
charity; its mild and serene countenance,
its sweet and gentle speech, its courteous
and obliging gesture, its fair dealing, its
benign conversation, its readiness to do
any good or service to any man, will
insinuate good-will and respect into all
hearts.</P>
<P>It thence will encompass a man with
friends, with many guards of his safety,
with many supports of his fortune,
with many patrons of his reputation,
with many succourers of his necessity,
with many comforters of his affliction:
for is a charitable man in danger, who
<PB N="205" REF="106"/>
will not defend him? is he falling, who
will not uphold him? is he falsly accu∣sed
or aspersed, who will not vindicate
him? is he in distress, who will not pi∣ty
him, who will not endeavour to re∣lieve
and restore him? who will insult
over his calamity? will it not in such
cases appear a common duty, a common
interest to assist and countenance a com∣mon
friend, a common benefactour to
mankind?</P>
<P>Whereas most of our life is spent in
society and discourse, charity is that
which doth season and sweeten these,
rendring them gratefull to others, and
commodious to ones self; for a chari∣table
heart is a sweet spring, from
whence do issue streams of wholsome
and pleasant discourse;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 15. 26. 16. 24.</NOTE> it not being
troubled with any bad passion or design,
which may sour or foul conversation,
doth ever make him good company to
others, and rendreth them such to him∣self;
which is a mighty convenience.
In short, <HI>a</HI> charitable man, or,
<HI>true lover of men will</HI> (saith
S. <HI>Chrysostome) inhabit earth
as a heaven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 32.</NOTE> <HI>every-where carry∣ing
a serenity with him, and
plaiting ten thousand crowns for
himself.</HI> Again,</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="107"/>
X. (5.) Charity doth in every estate
yield advantages sutable thereto; bette∣ring
it, and improving it to our benefit.</P>
<P>It rendreth prosperity not onely in∣nocent
and safe, but usefull and fruitfull
to us; we then indeed enjoy it, if we
feel the comfort of doing good by it: It
solaceth adversity, considering that it
doth not arise as a punishment or fruit
of ill-doing to others; that it is not at∣tended
with the deserved ill-will of men;
that no man hath reason to delight for
it, or insult over us therein; that we
may probably expect commiseration and
relief, having been ready to shew the
like to others.</P>
<P>It tempereth both states; for in pro∣sperity
a man cannot be transported
with immoderate joy, when so many
objects of pity and grief do present them∣selves
before him, which he is apt deeply
to resent; in prosperity he cannot be
dejected with extream sorrow, being re∣freshed
by so many good successes be∣falling
those whom he loveth: One con∣dition
will not puff him up, being sen∣sible
of his neighbours misery; the
other will not sink him down, having
complacence in his neighbours welfare.
Uncharitableness (proceeding from con∣trary
<PB N="207" REF="107"/>
causes, and producing contrary
effects) doth spoil all conditions, ren∣dring
prosperity fruitless, and adversity
comfortless.</P>
<P>XI. (6.) We may consider, that se∣cluding
the exercise of charity, all the
goods and advantages we have (our best
faculties of nature, our best endowments
of soul, the gifts of providence, and the
fruits of our industry) will become vain
and fruitless, or noxious and banefull to
us: for what is our reason worth, what
doth it signifie, if it serveth onely for
contriving sorry designs, or transacting
petty affairs about our selves? what is
wit good for, if it must be spent onely
in making sport, or hatching mischief?
to what purpose is knowledge, if it be
not applied to the instruction, direction,
admonition, or consolation of others?
what mattereth abundance of wealth, if
it be to be uselesly hoarded up, or vainly
flung away, in wicked or wanton pro∣fuseness;
if it be not employed in affor∣ding
succour to our neighbours indigen∣cy
and distress? what is our credit but a
meer noise or a puff of air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paulùm se∣pultae distat inertiae Cela∣ta virtus. <HI>Hor.</HI> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. 4. 9.</NOTE> if we do not give
a solidity and substance to it, by making
it an engine of doing good? what is our
vertue it self, if it be buried in obscurity
<PB N="208" REF="108"/>
or choaked with idleness, yielding no
benefit to others by the lustre of its ex∣ample,
or by its real influence? What is
any talent if it be wrapped up in a
napkin, any light if it be hid under a
bushel; any thing private if it be not
by good use spread out and improved to
publick benefit? If these gifts do mini∣ster
onely to our own particular advan∣tage,
to our personal convenience, glory,
or pleasure, how slimme things are they,
how inconsiderable is their worth?</P>
<P>But they being managed by charity
become precious and excellent things;
they are great in proportion to the great∣ness
of their use, or the extent of their
beneficial influence: as they carry forth
good to the world, so they bring back
various benefits to our selves;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 6. 38.</NOTE> they re∣turn
into our bosome laden with respect
and reward from God and from man;
they yield thanks and commendation
from without, they work comfort and
satisfaction within: Yea which is infi∣nitely
more considerable, and enhanceth
the price of our gifts to a vast rate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 15. 8.</NOTE> they
procure glory and blessing to God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 1. 11.</NOTE> for
<HI>hereby is God glorified,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 16.</NOTE> <HI>if we bring forth
much fruit;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 4. 31.</NOTE> and no good fruit can grow
from any other stock than that of charity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 9. 11.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="108"/>
Uncharitableness therefore should be
loathed and shunned by us, as that
which robbeth us of all our ornaments
and advantages; which indeed marreth
and corrupteth all our good things,
which turneth blessings into curses, and
rendreth the means of our welfare to be
causes of mischief to us; for without
charity a man can have no goods, but
goods worldly and temporal; and such
goods thence do prove impertinent bau∣bles,
burthensome encumbrances, dan∣gerous
snares, banefull poisons to him.</P>
<P>XII. (7.) Charity doth hugely ad∣vance
and amplifie a mans state, putting
him into the possession or fruition of all
good things: It will endow, enrich, en∣noble,
embelish us with all the world
hath of precious, of glorious, of fair;
by appropriation thereof to our selves,
and acquiring of a real interest therein▪
What men commonly out of fond self-love
do vainly affect, that infallibly by
being charitable they may compass, the
engrossing to themselves all kinds of
good: most easily, most innocently, in
a compendious and sure way, without
any sin or blame, without any care or
pain, without any danger or trouble,
<PB N="210" REF="109"/>
they may come to attain and to enjoy
whatever in common esteem is desirable
or valuable; they may without greedy
avarice, or the carkings, the drudgeries,
the disgraces going with it procure to
themselves abundant wealth; without
fond ambition, or the difficulties, the
hazards, the emulations, the strugglings
to which it is liable, they may arrive to
great honour; without sordid voluptu∣ousness,
or the satieties, the maladies,
the regrets consequent thereon, they
may enjoy all pleasure; without any
wildness or wantonness, pride, luxury,
sloth, any of its temptations and snares,
they may have all prosperity; they may
get all learning and wisedom without
laborious study, all vertue and goodness
without the fatigues of continual exer∣cise:
for are not all these things yours,
if you do esteem them so, if you do
make them so, by finding much delight
and satisfaction in them? doth not your
neighbours wealth enrich you, if you
feel content in his possessing and using
it? doth not his preferment advance
you, if your spirit riseth with it in a
gladsome complacence? doth not his
pleasure delight you, if you relish his
enjoyment of it? doth not his prosperity
<PB N="211" REF="109"/>
bless you, if your heart doth exult and
triumph in it? do not his endowments
adorn you, if you like them, if you
commend them, if the use of them doth
minister comfort and joy to you? This
is the divine Magick of charity, which
conveyeth all things into our hands,
and enstateth us in a dominion of them,
whereof nothing can disseise us; by vir∣tue
whereof <HI>being</HI> (as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> spea∣keth
of himself) <HI>sorrowfull we yet always
rejoice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6. 10.</NOTE> <HI>having nothing we yet possess all
things.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is this property in things
meerly imaginary or phantastick (like
that of Lunaticks, who fancy themselves
mighty Princes, or rich Aldermen) but
very substantial and real; yea far more
real to the charitable person, than it is
commonly to those, who in legal or
popular accompt are masters of them;
for how is propriety in things otherwise
considerable, than for the content and
pleasure which they yield to the presu∣med
owner? the which if a charitable
person abundantly draweth from them,
why are they not truly his? why is
not the Tree his, if he can pull and tast
its Fruits without injury or blame? yea
doth not the propriety more really be∣long
<PB N="212" REF="110"/>
to him, as to the gross possessour,
if he doth equally enjoy the benefit,
without partaking the inconveniencies
and impurities adherent to them; if he
taste them innocently and purely, with∣out
being cloyed, without being distrac∣ted,
without being puffed, without be∣ing
encumbred, ensnared, or corrupted
by them?</P>
<P>A charitable man therefore can never
(in a moral accompt) be poor, or vile, or
any-wise miserable; except all the world
should be cast into penury and distress;
for while his neighbour hath any thing,
he will enjoy it; <HI>rejoicing with those that
rejoice,</HI> as the Apostle doth enjoin.</P>
<P>XIII. (8.) If therefore we love our
selves, we must love others, and do
others good; charitable beneficence car∣rying
with it so many advantages to our
selves.</P>
<P>We by charitable complacence do par∣take
in their welfare, reaping pleasure
from all the fruits of their industry and
fortune.</P>
<P>We by charitable assistance do enable
and dispose them to make gratefull re∣turns
of succour in our need.</P>
<P>We thence assuredly shall obtain their
<PB N="213" REF="110"/>
good-will, their esteem, their commen∣dation:
we shall maintain peaceable and
comfortable entercourse with them, in
safety, in quiet, in good humour and
cheer.</P>
<P>Besides all other benefits we shall get
that of their prayers; the which of all
prayers have a most favourable audience
and assured efficacy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 5. 4.</NOTE> for if the com∣plaints
and curses of those who are op∣pressed
or neglected by uncharitable dea∣ling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 24. 15.</NOTE>
do certainly reach God's ears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclus. 4. 6.</NOTE> and
pull down vengeance from above; how
much more will the intercessions and
blessings of the poor pierce the heavens,
and thence draw recompence; seeing
God is more ready to perform his pro∣per
and pleasant works of bounty and
mercy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 62. 12.</NOTE> than to execute his <HI>strange</HI> and
unpleasing <HI>work</HI> of punishment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mic. 7. 18.</NOTE> Espe∣cially
the blessings of the poor being al∣ways
accompanied with praises and glo∣rifications
of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 28. 21.</NOTE> who enableth and dis∣poseth
men to do good; the which prai∣ses
will ever be reckoned on the accompt
of him, who drew them forth by his be∣neficence;
it will be (as the Apostle saith)
<HI>fruit redounding to his accompt;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 17.</NOTE> while
<HI>it aboundeth by many thanksgivings to
God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 9. 11. 8. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="111"/>
So in virtue of Charity the poorest
man amply may requite the wealthiest;
and a peasant may out-doe the greatest
Prince in beneficence.</P>
<P>XIV. We may consider, that Chari∣ty
is a practice specially gratefull to God,
and a most excellent part of our Duty;
not onely because he hath commanded
it as such with greatest earnestness; nor
onely because it doth constitute us in
nearest resemblance of him; but as a
peculiar expression of love and good-will
toward him; for if we love him, we
must for his sake have a kindness for his
friends, we must tender his interests, we
must favour his reputation, we must de∣sire
his content and pleasure, we must
contribute our endeavours toward the
furtherance of these his concerns: See∣ing
then God is an assured friend to all
men, seeing he hath a property in all
men (for he is God and Lord of all)
seeing he much concerneth himself for
all mens welfare; seeing from the pro∣sperity,
from the vertue, from the hap∣piness
of every man he gaineth honour
and praise;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 18.</NOTE> seeing he is greatly satisfied
and delighted in the good of men, we
also must love them: otherwise we
<PB N="215" REF="111"/>
greatly shall disoblige and disgust him.</P>
<P>Is it not indeed a practice
guilty of notorious enmity
toward him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Vid.</HI> Anthol.</NOTE> inconsistent
with the maintenance of a∣ny
friendship or peace with
him, to discord in affection
from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Chrys <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 32.</NOTE> maligning or dis∣affecting
those whom he
dearly loveth and favoureth,
who are so nearly allied to
him by manifold relations, as his Crea∣tures,
his Subjects, his Servants, his
Children, whom he designeth and de∣sireth
to crown with eternal glory and
bliss?</P>
<P>XV. Seeing God vouchsafeth to
esteem whatever is done in Charity to
our neighbour (if done with an honest
and pious mind, as to his friends) to be
done unto himself; that in feeding our
indigent neighbour, we refresh him, in
cloathing our neighbour we comfort
him; we do by charitable beneficence
oblige God, and become in a manner
benefactours to him; and as such assu∣redly
shall be requited by him; and is
not this a high privilege, a great honour,
a mighty advantage to us? If a man had
<PB N="216" REF="112"/>
opportunity to do that, which his Prince
would acknowledge a courtesie and ob∣ligation
to him, what a happiness would
he accompt it? and how far more con∣siderable
is it, that we can so easily do
that which the Lord of all, in whose
disposal all things are, will take so kind∣ly
at our hands?</P>
<P>XVI. We may consider, that Chari∣ty
is a very feasible and very easie Du∣ty:
it requireth no sore pain, no grie∣vous
trouble, no great cost;
for it consisteth onely in
good-will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 8. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 32.</NOTE> and that which
naturally springeth thence;
willingness and cheerfulness
are necessary ingredients or
adjuncts of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 9. 7. 8. 12. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;—Chrys. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> the which
imply facility: whence the
weakest and poorest man is
no less able to perform it
than the greatest potentate;
his heart may be as chari∣table,
though his hand can∣not
be so liberal; one of the most noble
and most famous charities that ever
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 21. 2.</NOTE> was the giving two mites; and
the <HI>giving a cup of cold water</HI> is the
instance of that beneficence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 10. 42.</NOTE> which
<PB N="217" REF="112"/>
shall not fail of being rewarded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">At nunc cùm omnia quae difficiliora sunt vel modica ex parte faciamus, hoc solum non facimus quod &amp; factu facilius est, &amp; absque quo casa sunt universa quae facimus: Je∣junii corpus sentit injuriam, vigiliae carnem macerant—haec omnia sunt qui faciant, sola charitas sine labore est. <HI>Hier.</HI> in <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>XVII. We may consider, that Cha∣rity
is the best, the most assured, the
most easie and expedite way, or instru∣ment
of performing all other duty to∣ward
our neighbour: If we would dis∣patch,
love and all is done; if we would
be perfect in obedience, love and we
shall not fail in any point;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 10.</NOTE> for <HI>love is
the fulfilling of the law;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 14.</NOTE> love <HI>is the bond
of perfectedness:</HI> would we be secure in
the practice of justice, of meekness, of
humility toward all men, of constant
fidelity toward our friends, of gentle
moderation toward our enemies, of
loyalty toward our superiours, of be∣nignity
toward our inferiours; if we
would be sure to purifie our minds from
ill thoughts, to restrain our tongues
from ill speaking, to abstain from all
bad demeanour and dealing? it is but
having charity, and infallibly you will
do all this;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12.</NOTE> for <HI>love worketh no ill to
its neighbour;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 5.</NOTE> <HI>love thinketh no evil;
love behaveth not it self unseemly.</HI></P>
<P>Would we discharge all our Duties
<PB N="218" REF="113"/>
without any reluctancy or
regret,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 32.</NOTE> with much satisfacti∣on,
and pleasure? love will
certainly dispose us thereto;
for it always acteth freely
and cheerfully,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is winged.</NOTE> without any
compulsion or straining;<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is fire.</NOTE>
it is ever accompanied with
delectation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amor obsequitur sponte, gratìs optempenat, liberè reveretur. <HI>Bern.</HI> ad <HI>Eug. Prol.</HI></NOTE> If we would
know its way and virtue of
acting, we may see it repre∣sented
in the proceeding of
<HI>Jacob,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Bern.</HI> Ep. 11. p. 1404.—</NOTE> who being inspired
by love did contentedly and
without regret endure so long and hard
toil, such disappointments and such af∣fronts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 29. 20.</NOTE>
<HI>And Jacob,</HI> saith the Text, <HI>ser∣ved
seven years for Rachel, and they
seemed to him but a few days for the
love he had to her.</HI></P>
<P>This is the root, from
whence voluntary obedience
doth naturally grow;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 32.</NOTE> if it
be planted in our heart, we
need not fear but that all
kind of good fruit will sprout forth into
conversation and practice.</P>
<P>But without it we shall not ever per∣form
any good work perfectly, steadily,
in a kindly manner; no other principle
<PB N="219" REF="113"/>
will serve, if we are onely moved by
whip and spur, driven on by fear, or in∣cited
by hope, we shall go forward un∣willingly
and dully, often halting, ever
flagging; those principles, which do put
slaves and mercenaries on action, as
they are not so noble and worthy, so nei∣ther
are they so effectual and sure; as
ambition, vain-glory, self-interest, de∣sign
of security, of profit, of compliance
with the expectation of men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>XVIII. Charity giveth worth, form,
and life to all vertue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrys. <HI>in</HI> 1 Cor. <HI>Or.</HI> 25.</NOTE> so that without it
no action is valuable in it self, or accep∣table
to God.</P>
<P>Sever it from courage; and what is
that, but the boldness or fierceness of a
beast? from meekness; and what is that,
but the softness of a woman, or weak∣ness
of a child? from courtesie; and
what is that, but affectation or artifice?
from justice; what is that, but humour
or policy? from wisedom; what is that,
but craft and subtilty?</P>
<P>What meaneth faith without it, but
dry opinion; what hope, but blind pre∣sumption;
what alms-doing, but ambi∣tious
ostentation; what undergoing mar∣tyrdom,
but stiffness or sturdiness of re∣solution;
<PB N="220" REF="114"/>
what is devotion, but glo∣zing
or mocking with God? what is
any practice (how specious soever in ap∣pearance,
or materially good) but an
issue of self-conceit, or self-will, of ser∣vile
fear, or mercenary design? <HI>Though
I have faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>so that I could remove moun∣tains,
and have not charity, I am nothing;
though I bestow all my goods to feed the
poor; and though I give my body to be
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
me nothing.</HI></P>
<P>But Charity doth sanctifie every acti∣on,
and impregnate all our practice with
a savour of goodness, turning all we do
into vertue; it is true fortitude, and gal∣lantry
indeed, when a man out of chari∣ty
and hearty design to promote his
neighbours good doth encounter dangers
and difficulties; it is genuine meekness,
when a man out of charity and unwil∣lingness
to hurt his neighbour, doth pa∣tiently
comport with injuries and dis∣courtesies;
it is vertuous courtesie, when
cordial affection venteth it self in civil
language, in respectfull deportment, in
obliging performances; it is excellent
justice, when a man regarding his neigh∣bours
case as his own, doth unto him,
as he would have it done to himself; it
<PB N="221" REF="114"/>
is admirable wisedom, which sagacious∣ly
contriveth and dexterously mana∣geth
things with the best advantage to∣wards
its neighbours good: It is a wor∣thy
faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 6.</NOTE> which being <HI>spirited</HI> and <HI>ac∣tuated</HI>
by charity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 2. 26.</NOTE> doth produce goodly
fruits of beneficence; it is a sound and
solid hope, which is grounded on that
everlasting foundation of charity, which
<HI>never doth fail,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3. 8.</NOTE> or fall away; it is sincere
alms, which not onely the hand, but
the heart doth reach forth; it is an ac∣ceptable
sacrifice, which is kindled by
the holy fire of fervent affection; it is a
pure devotion, which is offered up with
a calm and benign mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 8.</NOTE> resembling the
disposition of that goodness which it
adoreth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>If therefore we would do any thing
well, if we would not lose all the vertue,
and forfeit all the benefit of what we
perform, we must follow the Rule of
Saint <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 16. 14.</NOTE> <HI>to do all our works in cha∣rity.</HI></P>
<P>XIX. So great benefits doth Charity
yield; yet if it did not yield any of
them, it would deserve and claime our
observance; without regard to its sweet
fruits, and beneficial consequences, it
<PB N="222" REF="115"/>
were to be embraced and cherished; for
it carrieth a reward, and a heaven in it
self; the very same which constituteth
God himself infinitely happy, and which
beatifieth every blessed Spirit, in propor∣tion
to its capacity and exercise thereof:
A man doth abundantly enjoy himself
in that steady composedness, and savou∣ry
complacence of mind which ever doth
attend it; and as the present sense, so is
the memory of it, or the good consci∣ence
of having done good, very delici∣ous
and satisfactory.</P>
<P>As it is a raskally delight (tempered
with regret, and vanishing into bitter∣ness)
which men feel in wreaking spite,
or doing mischief; such as they cannot
reflect upon without disgust and con∣demning
their base impotency of soul;
so is the pleasure which charity doth
breed altogether pure, gratefull to the
mind, and encreasing by reflexion; ne∣ver
perishing or decaying; a man eter∣nally
enjoying the good he hath done,
by remembring and ruminating thereon.
In fine,</P>
<P>XX. Whereas the great obstacle to
Charity is self-love, or an extravagant
fondness of our own interests, yet un∣charitableness
<PB N="223" REF="115"/>
destroyeth that: for how
can we love our selves, if we do want
charity, how can we appear lovely to
our selves if we are destitute of so wor∣thy
an endowment, or if we can discern
those unworthy dispositions, which ac∣company
the defect of it? can we esteem
so mean, so vile, so ugly things as we
then are? <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, that bad men
cannot be friends to themselves, because
<HI>having in themselves nothing amiable,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Arist.</HI> Eth. 9. 4.</NOTE>
<HI>they can feel no affection toward them∣selves;</HI>
and certainly, if we are not stark
blind, or can but see wrath, spite, envy,
revenge in their own black and ugly
hue, we must needs (if they do possess
our souls) grow odious and despicable
to our selves. And being they do rob
us of so many great benefits, and bring
so many grievous mischiefs on us, we
cannot be otherwise than enemies to our
selves by cherishing them, or suffering
them to lodge in us.</P>
<P>These are some very considerable In∣ducements
to the practice of this great
vertue; there are divers others, of a
higher nature, derivable from the inmost
bowels of our Religion, grounded on its
peculiar Constitution and Obligations,
which I shall now forbear to mention,
<PB N="224" REF="116"/>
reserving them for a particular Discourse
by themselves.</P>
<P>O Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quinquag. Sund.</NOTE> who hast taught us, that all
our doings without Charity are nothing
worth; Send thy Holy Ghost, and pour
into our hearts that most excellent gift
of Charity, the very bond of peace and
of all vertues, without which whosoever
liveth is counted dead before thee. Grant
this for thine onely Son Jesus Christ's
sake.</P>

<Q>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,
live peaceably with all men.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Chapter containeth many
excellent Precepts, and whol∣some
Advices (scarce any por∣tion
of Holy Scripture so many in so
little compass.) From among them I have
selected one, alas, but too seasonable and
pertinent to the unhappy condition of
our distracted Age, wherein to observe
this, and such like Injunctions, is by
many esteemed an impossibility, by
others a wonder, by some a crime. It
hath an apt coherence with, yet no
necessary dependance upon the parts ad∣joining;
whence I may presume to treat
upon it distinctly by it self; and with∣out
farther preface or circumstance we
may consider several particulars therein.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="117"/>
I. And First, Concerning the Advice
it self, or the Substance of the Duty
charged on us, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>(to be in
peace,</HI> or <HI>live peaceably)</HI> we may take
notice, that, whether according to the
more usual acception it be applied to
the publick estate of things, or as here
doth relate onely to private conversati∣on,
it doth import,</P>
<P>1. Not barely a negation of doing,
or suffering harm; or an abstinence from
strise and violence (for a meer strange∣ness
this may be, a want of occasion,
or a truce, rather than a peace) but a
positive Amity, and disposition to per∣form
such kind offices, without which
good correspondence among men can∣not
subsist. For they who by reason of
distance of place, non-acquaintance, or
defect of opportunity maintain no enter∣course,
cannot properly be said to be in
peace with one another: But those who
have frequent occasion of commerce,
whose conditions require enterchanges
of courtesie and relief, who are some
way obliged and disposed to afford need∣full
succour, and safe retreat to each
other; These may be said to live in
peace together; and these onely; it be∣ing
in a manner impossible, that they
<PB N="227" REF="117"/>
who are not disposed to do good to others
(if they have power and opportunity)
should long abstain from doing harm.</P>
<P>2. Living peaceably implies not some
few transitory performances, proceeding
from casual humour or the like; but a
constant, stable, and well-settled condi∣tion
of being; a continual cessation from
injury, and promptitude to do good
offices. For as one blow doth not make
a battel, nor one skirmish a war; so
cannot single forbearances from doing
mischief, or some few particular acts of
kindness (such as meer strangers may
afford each other) be worthily styled a
being in peace: but an habitual incli∣nation
to these, a firm and durable e∣state
of innocence and beneficence.</P>
<P>3. Living in peace supposes a recipro∣cal
condition of being: not onely a per∣forming
good, and forbearing to do bad
offices, but a receiving the like treat∣ment
from others. For he, that being
assaulted is constrained to stand upon
his defence, may not be said to be in
peace, though his not being so (invo∣luntarily)
is not to be imputed to him.</P>
<P>4. Being in peace imports not onely
an outward cessation of violence and
seeming demonstration of amity, but an
<PB N="228" REF="118"/>
inward will and resolution to continue
therein. For he that intends, when oc∣casion
is presented, to do mischief to
another, is nevertheless an enemy, be∣cause
more secret and dangerous: an
ambuscado is no less a piece of war,
than confronting the enemy in open
field. Proclaiming and denouncing sig∣nifie,
but good and ill intention con∣stitute,
and are the souls of peace and
war. From these considerations we may
infer a description of being in peace, <HI>viz,</HI>
that it is, to bear mutual good-will, to
continue in amity, to maintain good
correspondence, to be upon terms of
mutual courtesie and benevolence; to
be disposed to perform reciprocally all
offices of humanity; assistance in need,
comfort in sorrow, relief in distress; to
please and satisfie one another, by ad∣vancing
the innocent delight, and pro∣moting
the just advantage of each other;
to converse with confidence and securi∣ty,
without suspicion on either hand
of any fraudulent, malicious, or hurtfull
practices against either: Or, negatively;
Not to be in a state of enmity, personal
hatred, pertinacious anger, jealousie, en∣vy,
or ill-will; not to be apt to provoke,
to reproach, to harm, or hinder another,
<PB N="229" REF="118"/>
nor to have reasonable grounds of expec∣ting
the same bad usage from others: to
be removed from danger of vexatious
quarrels, entercourse of odious language,
offending others, or being disquieted ones
self. This I take to be the meaning of
living, or being in peace, differing onely
in degree of obligation, and latitude of
object, from the state of friendship pro∣perly
so called, and opposed to a con∣dition
of enmity, defiance, contention,
hatred, suspicion, animosity.</P>
<P>II. In the next place we may consider
the Object of this Duty, signified in
those words, <HI>With all men.</HI> We often
meet in Scripture with exhortations di∣rected
peculiarly to Christians, to be at
peace among themselves; as <HI>(Mark 9. 5.)</HI>
Our <HI>Saviour</HI> layes this Injunction upon
his Disciples, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Have
peace one with another;</HI> inculcated by
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> upon the <HI>Thessalonians</HI> in the
same words: and the like we have in
the Second Epistle to <HI>Timothy</HI> Chap. 2.
Ver. 22. <HI>Follow righteousness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 13.</NOTE> <HI>faith, cha∣rity,
peace with them that call upon the
Lord out of a pure heart;</HI> and to the
<HI>Romans (14. 17.)</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Eph. 4. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Let us therefore follow
after the things that make for peace,
<PB N="230" REF="119"/>
and things wherewith one may edifie ano∣ther.</HI>
But here the Duty hath a more
large and comprehensive Object: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>all men:</HI> as likewise it hath
in the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Chap. 12.
Ver. 14. <HI>Pursue peace with all men;</HI> with
all men without any exception, with
men of all Nations, Jews and Gentiles,
Greeks and Barbarians; of all Sects and
Religions; persecuting Jews and Idola∣trous
Heathens; (for of such consisted
the generality of men at that time) and
so Saint <HI>Paul</HI> expresly in a like advice,
<HI>(1 Cor. 10. 32. Give no offence neither to
the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the
Church of God; Even as I please all men.)</HI>
And I may add by evident parity of rea∣son,
with men of all degrees and estates,
high and low, noble and base, rich and
poor; of all tempers and dispositions, meek
and angry, gentle and froward, pliable
and perverse; of all endowments, wise
and foolish, vertuous and vicious; of all
judgments and persuasions, Orthodox
and Heretical, peaceable and schismatical
persons: this universally vast and bound∣less
term, <HI>All men,</HI> contains them all.
Neither is there any evading our obli∣gation
to this Duty, by pretending about
others, that they differ from us in humour
<PB N="231" REF="119"/>
and complexion of soul, that they enter∣tain
opinions irreconcileably contrary to
ours; that they adhere to sects and par∣ties
which we dislike and disavow; that
they are not so vertuous, so religious, so
holy as they should be, or at least not
in such a manner as we would have
them; for be this allegation true or false,
it will not excuse us; while they are not
devested of humane nature, and can tru∣ly
lay claim to the name and title of men,
we are by vertue of this Precept obliged
to live peaceably with them.</P>
<P>III. We may consider the Qualifica∣tion
of the Duty here expressed, and
what those words mean; <HI>If it be possible,
as much as lieth in you.</HI> To which pur∣pose
we may advert, from our descrip∣tion
of living peaceably, that it consists
mainly of two parts: one <HI>active,</HI> or pro∣ceeding
from us, and terminated on o∣thers,
To bear good will, to do good of∣fices,
to procure the profit, delight and
welfare, to abstain from the displeasure,
dammage and disturbance of others:
The other <HI>passive,</HI> issuing from others,
and terminated on our selves; That they
be well affected toward us, inclinable to
do us good, and no wise disposed to wish,
<PB N="232" REF="120"/>
design, or bring any harm, trouble, or
vexation upon us. Whereof the former
is altogether in our power, consisting of
acts or omissions depending upon our
free choice and counsel; and we are di∣rectly
obliged to it, by virtue of those
words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>as much as lieth in
you:</HI> the latter is not fully so, yet com∣monly
there be probable means of ef∣fecting
it, which we are hence bound
to use, though sometimes they may fail
of success. For the words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>if it be possible,</HI> as they signifie the ut∣most
endeavour is to be employed; and
that no difficulty (beneath the degree of
impossibility) can discharge us from it,
so they intimate plainly, that sometime
our labour may be lost, and our purpose
defeated; and that by the default of o∣thers
it may be impossible we should
arrive to a peaceable condition of life
with all men. However, by this Rule
we are directed not onely our selves not
to infringe the terms of peace toward
others, but to endeavour earnestly by
all honest and prudent means to obtain
the good-will, favour and respect of others,
by which they may be disposed to all
friendly correspondence with us, and not
to disturb the quiet and tranquillity of our
lives.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="120"/>
Having thus by way of Explication
superficially glanced upon the words,
we will proceed to a more large and
punctual review of them; and shall con∣sider
more distinctly the Particulars gross∣ly
mentioned; and</P>
<P>I. What those especial Duties are, in∣cluded
in this more comprehensive one
of living peaceably with all men; both
those which are directly required of
us, as the necessary causes, or imme∣diate
results of a peaceable disposition in
us toward others; and also those which
are to be performed by us, as just and
reasonable means conducible to beget or
preserve in others a peaceable inclinati∣on
toward us: these I shall consider pro∣miscuously:
and</P>
<P>1. We are by this Precept directly
obliged heartily to love, that is to be
bear good-will to, to wish well to, to
rejoice in the welfare, and commiserate
the adversities of all men: at least not
to hate, or bear ill-will to, to desire, or
design the harm, to repine at the happy
success, or delight in the misfortunes of
any: for as it is very hard to maintain
peace and amicable correspondence with
those we do not truly love; so it is ab∣solutely
<PB N="234" REF="121"/>
impossible to do it long with
those we hate; this Satanick passion (or
disposition of soul) always prompting
the mind possessed therewith to the
contrivance and execution of mischief;
whence he that hates his brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 3. 15.</NOTE> is
said to be a murtherer, as having in him
that bitter root, from whence, if power
and occasion conspire, will probably
spring that most extream of outrages,
and capital breach of peace. Love is the
onely sure cement, that knits and com∣bines
men in friendly society; and ha∣tred
the certain fountain of that violence
which rends and dissolves it. We can∣not
easily hurt, or strive with those we
love and wish well to: we cannot pos∣sibly
long agree with those we hate and
malign. Peace without love can be
esteemed little more than politick dissi∣mulation;
and peace with hatred is re∣ally
nothing less than an artificial dis∣guise,
or an insidious covert of enmity.</P>
<P>2. We are hence obliged to perform
all kind offices of humanity, which the
condition of any man can require, and
may by us be performed without consi∣derable
inconvenience or detriment to
our selves or others. When for the pre∣servation,
or comfortable accommoda∣tion
<PB N="235" REF="121"/>
of life, they need our help or our
advice, we are readily to afford them;
when they are in want or distress, we
are to minister to them what comfort
and relief we can. We are (upon this
very score) to obey that Injunction of
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Galatians;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 6. 10.</NOTE> <HI>As we have
opportunity, let us do good to all men.</HI>
For without this beneficence a mans car∣riage
(though otherwise harmless and
inoffensive) appears rather a suspicious
strangeness, than a peaceable demeanour,
and naturally produces an enmity in
those that are concerned in it. For
he to whom, being pressed with neces∣sity,
requisite assistance is denied, will
infallibly be apt to think himself not
onely neglected and disesteemed, but af∣fronted
also and injured; (Need in the
general conceit of men, and especially
of those that feel it, begetteth a kind of
title to some competent relief) and con∣sequently
will heinously resent, and com∣plain
bitterly of such supposed wrong,
and if ever he become able, repay it with
advantage. And much more are we
upon the same accompt not to perform
ill offices toward any man; not to dis∣turb
him in the enjoyment of his inno∣cent
pleasure, nor to hinder him in the
<PB N="236" REF="122"/>
advancing his lawfull profit, nor to in∣terrupt
him in the prosecution of his
reasonable designs; nor any wise to vex
and grieve him needlesly; and (above
all) not to detain him in, nor to aggra∣vate
his affliction. For these are actual
violations of peace, and impediments of
good correspondence among men. Far∣ther,</P>
<P>3. In this Duty of living peaceably
is included an obligation to all kind of
just and honest dealing with all men:
punctually to observe contracts, impar∣tially
to decide controversies, equally to
distribute rewards; to injure no man
either in his estate, by violent or frau∣dulent
encroachments upon his just pos∣sessions;
or in his reputation, by raising
or dispersing slanderous reports concer∣ning
him: For these courses of all others
are most destructive to peace, and upon
the pretence of them most quarrels, that
ever were, have been commenced.</P>
<P>Justice in its own nature is, and
by the common agreement of men hath
been designed the Guardian of peace,
and sovereign remedy of contention:
but not to insist long upon such obvious
subjects.</P>
<P>4. It much conduceth to the preser∣vation
<PB N="237" REF="122"/>
of peace, and upholding ami∣cable
correspondence, in our dealings
and transactions with men, liable to
doubt and debate, not to insist upon
nice and rigorous points of right, not
to take all advantage offered us, not to
deal hard measure, nor to use extremi∣ties
to the dammage or hindrance of
others, especially when no comparable
benefit will thence accrue to our selves.
For such proceedings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Tit. 3. 2. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> as they discover
in us little kindness to, or tenderness of
our neighbours good, so they exceeding∣ly
exasperate them, and persuade them
we are their enemies, and render them
ours, and so utterly destroy peace be∣tween
us. When as abating something
from the height and strictness of our
pretences, and a favourable recession in
such cases will greatly engage men to
have an honourable opinion, and a peace∣able
affection toward us.</P>
<P>5. If we would attain to this peaceable
estate of life, we must use toward all men
such demonstrations of respect and cour∣tesie,
which according to their degree
and station custom doth entitle them to,
or which upon the common score of hu∣manity
they may be reasonably deemed
to expect from us: respective gestures, civil
<PB N="238" REF="123"/>
salutations, free access, affable demea∣nour,
cheerfull looks, and courteous dis∣course.
These as they betoken good-will
in them that use them, so they beget,
cherish, and encrease it in those, whom
they refer to: and the necessary fruit of
mutual good-will is peace. But the con∣trary
carriages; contemptuous or disre∣gardfull
behaviour, difficulty of admissi∣on
to converse, a tetrical or sullen as∣pect,
rough and fastidious language, as
they discover a mind averse from friend∣ly
commerce, so they beget a more po∣tent
disdain in others: Men generally
(especially those of generous and hearty
temper) valuing their due respect be∣yond
all other interests, and more con∣tentedly
brooking injury than neglect.
Whence this skill and dexterity of de∣portment
(though immediately, and in
its own nature of no great worth, and
regulating actions of small importance,
gestures, looks, and forms of speech)
yet because it is a nurse of peace, and
greatly contributes to the delightfulness
of society, hath been always much com∣mended,
and hath obtained a conspicu∣ous
place in the honourable rank of ver∣tues,
under the titles of courtesie, co∣mity,
and affability; and the opposites
<PB N="239" REF="123"/>
thereto, rudeness and rusticity, have been
deservedly counted and called vices in
morality.</P>
<P>6. This Precept directly prohibits the
use of all reproachfull, scornfull, and pro∣voking
language; these being the imme∣diate
results of enmity, and actual brea∣ches
of peace. Whence Saint <HI>Paul</HI> con∣joins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3. 2.</NOTE>

more the loss of their honour than their
lives, and take more grievously the ra∣vishing
of their credit than the depreda∣tion
of their estate. Living peaceably
therefore implies as much abstaining
from opprobrious words as injurious ac∣tions;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Chrys.</HI> Tom. 5. pag. 32.</NOTE>
yea more: for reviling is not
onely a violation of peace, but a disho∣nourable
<PB N="240" REF="124"/>
waging of war; like shooting
arrows dipt in poison, and discharging
sluggs against our neighbours reputati∣on;
practices condemned by all as base
and inhumane, and contrary to the laws
of a noble warfare; being arguments,
we affect rather our adversaries utter
ruine, than a gallant victory over him.
There be fair ways of disputing our cause
without contumelious reflections upon
persons; and the errours of men may
be sufficiently refuted without Satyrical
virulency. One good reason modestly
propounded hath in it naturally more
power and efficacy to convince him
that is in a mistake, or to confound him
with shame that is guilty of a fault, than
ten thousand scoffs and ignominious
taunts.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Egre∣gium Anto∣nini locum, lib. 11. § 18. 9. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> When we are to express those
deeds of nature (the performance of
which is concealed, as containing in it
something of supposed turpitude) we
are wont to veil them in such modest
circumlocutions, that by the hearers
without offence to their bashfulness may
sufficiently be understood. So when it
is needfull or expedient to confute the
opinions, or reprove the actions of
men, if we either charitably design their
amendment, or desire to maintain peace∣able
<PB N="241" REF="124"/>
correspondence with them, it be∣hoves
that we do not by using the most
broad and distastfull language immode∣rately
trespass upon their modesty and
patience; that (to use <HI>Seneca</HI>'s phrase)
we do <HI>Agere cardm non tantùm salutis, sed
&amp; honestae cicatricis,</HI> De Clem. <HI>lib. 1. c. 17.
Have a care not only to cure the wound,
but to leave a comely scar,</HI> and not to

soft hand and a tender heart, and a gen∣tle
tongue are most convenient qualities
of a spiritual Chirurgeon. But farther
to this purpose▪</P>
<P>7. If we desire to live peaceably with
all men we are to be equal in censuring
mens actions, candid in interpreting their
meanings, mild in reprehending, and
sparing to relate their miscarriages, to
derive their actions from the best prin∣ciples
(from which in the judgment of
charity they may be supposed to proceed,
as from casual mistake rather than from
wilfull prejudice; from humane infir∣mity
rather than from malicious design)
to construe ambiguous expressions to the
most favourable sense they may admit;
<PB N="242" REF="125"/>
not to condemn mens practices without
distinct knowledge of the case, and exa∣mining
the reasons, which possibly may
absolve or excuse them: to extenuate
their acknowledged faults by such cir∣cumstances
as aptly serve that purpose,
and not to exaggerate them by streined
consequences, or uncertain conjectures.
To rebuke them (if need be) so as they
may perceive we sincerely pity their er∣rours,
and tender their good; and wish
nothing more then their recovery, and
do not design to upbraid, deride, or in∣sult
over them being fallen; and finally
not to recount their misdeeds over-fre∣quently,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 17. 9.</NOTE>
unseasonably, and with com∣placence.
He that thus demeaneth him∣self,
manifestly sheweth himself to prize
his neighbours good-will, and to be de∣sirous
to continue in amity with him;
and assuredly obliges him to be in the
same manner affected toward him. But
he that is rigidly severe and censorious
in his judgments, blaming in them
things indifferent, condemning actions
allowable, detracting from qualities com∣mendable,
deducing mens doings from
the worst causes, and imputing them to
the worst ends, and representing them
under the most odious appellations, (that
<PB N="243" REF="125"/>
calls all Impositions of superiours, which
he dislikes, Tyranny, and all manners of
divine worship, that sute not to his fan∣cy,
superstition, and all pretences to
conscience in those that dissent from him,
hypocrisy; and all opinions different
from his, heresy: that is suspicious of
ill intention without sufficient ground,
and prejudicates mens meanings before
he well apprehends them, and capti∣ously
perverts sayings capable of good
construction;<NOTE PLACE="marg">That flies like a Vulture to Carrion only. Plut. <HI>de util. cap. ex inim.</HI></NOTE> That is curiously inquisi∣tive
into his neighbours life, and gladly

bitter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 24. 17.</NOTE> fierce and vehement in accusing
and inveighing against others, painting
such, as he assumes to impugn, with
the blackest colours, in the most horrid
shape and ugly dress, converting all
matter of discourse (though never so un∣seasonably
and impertinently) into de∣clamation,
and therein copiously expa∣tiating,
in fine employing his utmost
might of wit and eloquence and confi∣dence
in rendring that to others as hate∣full,
as he signifies they are to himself,
such men, what do they else but loudly
proclaim that they despise their neigh∣bours
<PB N="244" REF="126"/>
good-will, purposely provoke his
anger, and defie his utmost enmity? for
'tis impossible such dealing should not by
them, who are therein concerned, be
accompted extreamly unjust, and to pro∣ceed
from desperate hatred.</P>
<P>8. He that would effectually observe
this Apostolick rule, must be disposed
to overlook such lesser faults committed
against him, as make no great breach
upon his interest or credit,
yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sen.</HI> Ben. 7. 31. Vincit malos pertinax bonitas. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 21.</NOTE> to forget or forgive the

the hasty passions of his neigh∣bour,
and to embrace readi∣ly
any seāsonable overture,
and accept any tolerable con∣ditions
of reconcilement. For
even in common life that observation of
our Saviour most exactly holds, <HI>It is
impossible that offences should not come.</HI>
The air may sooner become wholly
fixed, and the sea continue in a perfect
rest without waves, or undulations,
than humane conversation be altogether
free from occasions of distast, which he
that cannot either prudently dissemble,
<PB N="245" REF="126"/>
or patiently digest, must renounce all
hopes of living peaceably here. He that
like tinder is inflammable by the least
spark, and is inraged by every angry
word, and resents deeply every petty
affront, and cannot endure the memory
of a past unkindness should upon any
terms be defaced; resolves surely to live
in eternal tumult and combustion; to
multiply daily upon himself fresh quar∣rels,
and to perpetuate all enmity alrea∣dy
begun. When as by total passing by
those little causes of disgust, the present
contention is altogether avoided, or in∣stantly
appeased, our neighbours passion
suddenly evaporates, and consumes it
self; no remarkable footsteps of dissensi∣on
remain; our neighbour reflecting
upon what is past sees himself obliged by
our discreet forbearance, however all
possible means are used to prevent trouble
and preserve peace. To this purpose
<HI>(The discretion of a man deferreth his
anger,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 19. 11.</NOTE> <HI>and it is his glory to pass over a
transgression)</HI> saith <HI>Solomon:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 17. 9.</NOTE> and <HI>He
that covereth a transgression seeketh love,</HI>
saith the same wise Prince. But far∣ther</P>
<P>9. If we would live peaceably with all
men, we must not over highly value our
<PB N="246" REF="127"/>
selves, nor over eagerly pursue our own
things. We must not admire our own
endowments, nor insist upon our deserts,
for this will make us apt to depreciate
others, and them to loath us. We must
not be over tender of our credit, and co∣vetous
of respect; for this will render us
apt to take exceptions, and engage us
in troublesome competitions for superio∣rity
of place, and preeminence in the
vain opinions of men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 28. 25.</NOTE> <HI>(He that is of a
proud heart stirreth up strife:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 13. 10.</NOTE> and <HI>Only
(i. e.</HI> chiefly) <HI>from pride cometh con∣tention,</HI>
saith <HI>Solomon.)</HI> We must not
be much addicted to our own interests,
for this will dispose us to encroach upon
the concernments of others, and them
to resist our attempts, whence conflict
and enmity will necessarily arise. We
must not prefer our own judgments, and
imperiously obtrude them upon others;
nor be pertinacious in perswading them
to embrace our private opinions, nor
violently urgent to a compliance with
our humour. For these things are into∣lerably
fastidious in conversation, and
obnoxious to be charged with usurpation
and iniquity; all men naturally challen∣ging
to themselves an equal, or at least a
proportionable share of reason, together
<PB N="247" REF="127"/>
with the free conduct of their lives un∣controllable
by private dictates. If
therefore we desire to live quietly, and
not needlesly to disoblige, or displease
others, we should be modest in estee∣ming
our own abilities, and moderate
in pursuing our own advantages, and in
our converse not less complacent to o∣thers
then we desire they should be to
us; and as liberal in allowing leave to
dissent from us, as we are bold in taking
freedom to abound in our own sense.
And if in debate a modest declaration of
our opinion, and the reasons inducing
us thereto, will not prevail, it behoves
us to give over such a succesless combat,
and to retire into the silent enjoyment of
our own thoughts. From not observing
which rule discourse grows into conten∣tion,
and contention improves into feud
and enmity.</P>
<P>10. If we would live peaceably, it
concerns us to abstain from needless con∣tests
about matters of opinion, and que∣stions
either meerly vain and frivolous,
of little use or concernment, or over nice
and subtle, and thence indeterminable
by reason; or that are agitated with ex∣traordinary
eagerness and heat of pas∣sion;
or such as are already defined by
<PB N="248" REF="128"/>
general consent, or such upon the deci∣sion
of which the publick peace and safe∣ty
do depend. There are some contro∣versies
prickly like brambles, and apt to
scratch those that handle them, but
yielding no savoury or wholsom fruit:
such as concern the consequences of ima∣ginary
suppositions, the state and cir∣cumstances
of Beings to us unknown,
the right application of artificial terms,
and the like impertinent matters; which
serve to no other purpose but the exer∣cise
of curious wits, and exciting emu∣lation
among them. Others there be
concerning matters of more weighty
moment, yet having their resolution
depending upon secrets unsearchable, or
the interpretation of ambiguous words,
and obscure phrases, or upon some other
uncertain conjectures; and are yet ren∣dred
more difficult by being intangled
with inextricable folds of subtilty, nice
distinctions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Non amplius inveniri licet quàm quod à Deo discitur. <HI>Tertull.</HI> de Anim. cap. 2.</NOTE> and crafty evasions, devi∣sed
by the parties engaged in them for
the maintenance of their causes respe∣ctively,
whence it hath happened, though
with immense care and diligence of both
parts they have been long canvased;
that yet they do, and in all probability
will for ever remain undecided. So that
<PB N="249" REF="128"/>
now to engage in contest about them,
may be reasonably deemed nothing more
than a wilfull mispense of our time, labour
and good humour; by vainly reciproca∣ting
the saw of endless contention. Other
questions there be in themselves of more
easy resolution, and of considerable im∣portance,
which yet by extreme oppo∣sition
of parties are so clouded and over∣grown
with insuperable prejudices, that
the disputing them is seldom attended
with other success, than an inflaming
our selves and others with passion. O∣thers
are by small and obscure parties ma∣naged
against the common consent, and
against the positive decrees of the most
venerable authoities among men, by
ventilating which as truth is like to gain
little, so peace is sure to suffer much.
For as it is no wise a safe or advised
course (except in case of necessary de∣fence)
to subject received opinions to the
hazardous trial of a tumultuary conflict,
their credit being better upheld by a
stately reservedness, than by a popular
forwardness of discourse; as buildings
stand fastest that are never shaken, and
those possessions remain most secure that
are never called in question: so on the
other hand to countenance new and un∣couth
<PB N="250" REF="129"/>
paradoxes, as it argues too much
arrogance and presumption in confron∣ting
our single apprehensions against the
deliberate sense and suffrage of so many
men, yea so many ages of men; and is
likely to prove a succesless attempt, like
swimming against the current, accom∣panied
with much toil and little progress,
so it serves no good end, but only fo∣ments
divisions, and disturbs both our
private and the publik peace. But most
of all we are to be cautelous of medling
with controversies of dangerous conse∣quence,
wherein the publick weal and
quiet are concerned, which bare the
roots of sacred authority, and prostitute
the mysteries of government to vulgar
inspection. Such points ought to be
subjects of law, not of syllogism, and
the errours in them to be
corrected by punishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Arist.</HI> Top. 1. 8.</NOTE> ra∣ther
then confuted by argu∣ment:
neither can it be
thought reasonable that the
interest of publick peace
should depend upon the
event of private disputation. It concerns
us therefore, if we would live peaceably
in such disputable matters, reserving all
due reverence to the judgments of the
<PB N="251" REF="129"/>
most, the best and wisest persons, to be
content in a modest privacy, to enjoy the
results of a serious and impartial disquisi∣tion,
patiently enduring others to dissent
from us, and not attempting by need∣less,
fruitless, and endless contentions to
gain others to our persuasions; especial∣ly
since the truth contended for may not
be worth the passion employed upon it,
and the benefits of the victory not coun∣tervail
the prejudices sustained in the
combat. For goodness and vertue may
often consist with ignorance and errour,
seldom with strife and discord. And this
consideration I shall conclude with those
exhortations of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> Tit. 3. 9. <HI>But
foolish questions, and genealogies, and
contentions, and law-contests decline, for
they are unprofitable and vain.</HI> And in

those that are * contrarily disposed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
And in the same Chapter, v. 14. <HI>Of
these things put them in remembrance,
charging them before the Lord, that they
strive not about words to no profit, to the
<PB N="252" REF="130"/>
subverting of the hearers:</HI> Of so perni∣cious
consequence did Saint <HI>Paul</HI> esteem
unnecessary wrangling and disputing to
be. But farther</P>
<P>11. If we desire to live peaceably we
must restrain our pragmati∣cal
curiosity within the
bounds of our proper business
and concernment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>According to St.</HI> Paul'<HI>s advice</HI> (1 Thess. 4. 11.) Strive <HI>(or be ambitious)</HI> to be quiet, and to mind your own business. (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.)</NOTE> not [being
<HI>curiosi in aliena Republ.]</HI> in∣vading
other mens provinces,
and without leave or com∣mission
intermeddling with their affairs;
not rushing into their Closets, prying
into their concealed designs, or dictating
counsel to them without due invitation
thereto; not controlling their actions,
nor subjecting their proceedings to our
censure without competent authority.
For these courses men usually look upon
as rash intrusions, both injurious and re∣proachfull
to them, usurping upon that
freedom of choice (which all men passio∣nately
affect to preserve entire to them∣selves)
and arguing them of weakness
and incapacity to manage their own bu∣siness:
neither do men more naturally
drive away flies that buzze about their
ears and molest them in their employ∣ments,
than they with disdain repell
<PB N="253" REF="130"/>
such immodest and unseasonable medlers
in their affairs. Let no man suffer (saith
Saint <HI>Peter) as a busy body in other mens
matters:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4. 15.</NOTE> intimating that those who are
impertinently inquisitive into other mens
matters, make themselves liable to suffer
(and that deservedly) for their fond curi∣osity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 26. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>
and bold presumption. And <HI>He
that passeth by, and medleth with strife
belonging not to him, is like one that ta∣keth
a dog by the ears,</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon;)</HI>
that is, he catcheth at that which he can∣not
hold, and vainly aims at that which
he cannot effect, and rashly irritates
those which will turn upon him and bite
him. If therefore we would neither mo∣lest
others, nor be disquieted our selves,
we must be like natural agents, never
working ought beyond our proper sphere
of activity. But especially, if we desire
to live peaceably, we must beware of
assuming to our selves a liberty to censure
the designs, decrees, or transactions of
publick authority, and of saying to our
Superiours, what dost thou? and much
more, by querulous murmurings, or
clamorous declamations, of bringing en∣vy
and <HI>odium</HI> upon them. Few private
men are capable of judging aright con∣cerning
those things, as being placed be∣neath
<PB N="254" REF="131"/>
in a valley, and wanting a due
prospect upon the ground and causes of
their proceedings, who by reason of their
eminent station can see more and farther
then they; and therefore are incompe∣tent
Judges, and unjustly presume to
interpose their sentence in such cases.
But suppose the actions of Superiours
notoriously blameable and scandalous,
and that by infallible arguments we are
persuaded thereof; yet seeing neither
the taxing of, nor complaint against
them doth in any wise regularly belong
to us, nor the discovery of our mind
therein can probably be an efficacious
means of procuring redress, and imme∣diately
tends to diminish the reputation,
and weaken the affection due to govern∣ment,
and consequently to impair the
peaceable estate of things, which by
them is sustained, we are wholly to ab∣stain
from such unwarrantable, unprofi∣table
and turbulent practices; and with
a submiss and discreet silence, passing over
the miscarriages of our Superiours, to
wait patiently upon the providence, and
implore the assistence of Him, who is
the only competent Judge of such, and
sovereign disposer of all things, who
hath their hearts in his hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 21. 1.</NOTE> and fashio∣neth
<PB N="255" REF="131"/>
them as he thinks good.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 33. 15.</NOTE> Farther,</P>
<P>12. If we would live peaceably with
all men, it behoves us not to engage our
selves so deeply in any singular friend∣ship,
or in devotion to any one party of
men, as to be entirely partial to their
interests, and prejudiced in their behalf,
without distinct consideration of the
truth and equity of their pretences in
the particular matters of difference; not
to approve, favour or applaud that
which is bad in some, to dislike, dis∣countenance
or disparage that which is
good in others: not out of excessive kind∣ness
to some, to give just cause of distast
to others: not for the sake of a fortui∣tous
agreement in disposition, opinion,
interest or relation to violate the duties
of justice or humanity. For he that up∣on
such terms is a friend to any one man,
or party of men, as to be resolved (with
an implicit faith, or blind obedience)
to maintain what-ever he or they shall
affirm to be true, and what-ever they
shall doe to be good, doth in a manner
undertake enmity against all men beside,
and as it may happen doth oblige himself
to contradict plain truth, to deviate from
the rules of vertue, and to offend Al∣mighty
God himself. This unlimited
<PB N="256" REF="132"/>
partiality we owe only to truth and
goodness, and to God (the fountain of
them) in no case to swerve from their
dictates and prescriptions. He that
followed <HI>Tiberius Gracchus</HI> in his sediti∣ous
practices, upon the bare accompt of
friendship, and alledged in his excuse, that
if his friend had required it of him, he
should as readily have put fire to the
Capitol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. <HI>in</HI> Laelio.</NOTE> was much more abominable
for his disloyalty to his Country, and
horrible impiety against God, than com∣mendable
for his constant fidelity to his
friend. And that <HI>Souldier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. <HI>lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> which is
said to have told <HI>Caesar</HI> (in his first ex∣pedition
against <HI>Rome)</HI> that in obedience
to his commands he would not refuse to
sheath his sword in the breast of his Bro∣ther,
or in the throat of his aged Father,
or in the bowels of his pregnant Mother,
was for his unnatural barbarity rather to
be abhorred, than to be esteemed for his
loyal affection to his General. And in
like manner he that to please or gratify
the humour of his friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prov.</HI> 24. 24. He that saith to the wicked thou art righ∣teous, him shall the peo∣ple curse, na∣tions shall ab∣hor him.</NOTE> can be either
injurious, or treacherous, or notably
discourteous to any man else, is very
blameable, and renders himself deser∣vedly
odious to all others. <HI>Laelius,</HI>
who incomparably well both understood
<PB N="257" REF="132"/>
and practised the rules of friendship, is
by <HI>Cicero</HI> reported to have made this
the first and chief Law thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cic. <HI>in</HI> Laelio.</NOTE> <HI>Vt
neque rogemus res turpes, nec faciamus
rogati, That we neither require of our
friends the performance of base and naugh∣ty
things; nor being requested of them,
perform such our selves.</HI> And in the he∣raldry,
or comparison of duties, as all
others must give place to those of piety,
verity and vertue, so after them the du∣ties
of humanity justly challenge the
next place of respect, even above those
which belong to the highest degree of
friendship (due to our nearest relations,
yea to our Country it self) precisely ta∣ken,
abstracted, and distinguished from
those of humanity. For the World is in
nature the first, the most comprehen∣sive
and dearest Country of us all; and
our general obligations to mankind are
more ancient, more fundamental, and
more indispensable, than those particu∣lar
ones superadded to or superstructed
on them. The peace therefore of the
World, and the general welfare of men
its Citizens, ought to be more dear to
us, and the means conducing thereto
more carefully regarded by us in our
actions, than either the love, favour or
<PB N="258" REF="133"/>
satisfaction of any particular persons is
to be valued or pursued. And the not
observing this rule may reasonably be
esteemed to have a great influence upon
the continuance of those implacable feuds
and dissensions wherewith the world is
so miserably torn and shattered. Mens
being peremptorily resolved to extoll,
countenance, or excuse promiscuously
all the principles and proceedings of the
party to which they have addicted them∣selves,
and to see no errour, fault or
abuse in them; but by all means to de∣press,
vilify and condemn (if not to re∣proach,
calumniate and persecute) the
opinions and practices of others, and
not to acknowledge in them any thing
considerably good or commendable;
whence commonly all apprehend their
adversaries extremely unjust and disin∣genuous
towards them, and are aliena∣ted
from all thoughts, (or however dis∣couraged
from all hopes) of friendly ac∣commodation
and reconcilement. But
he that would live peaceably with all
men, must be free in his judgment, im∣partial
in his dealing, and ingenuous in
his carriage toward all:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jud. 16.</NOTE> not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
admiring, or wondring at
some men (as if they were impeccable,
<PB N="259" REF="133"/>
or infallible) nor having the truth in re∣spect
of persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 2. 1.</NOTE> abetting in his friends
onely what is just and true, and allow∣ing
the same in others, but in neither
by signal approbation countenancing any
thing false or evil; for so demeaning him∣self,
he giveth no man just occasion of
displeasure or enmity against him.</P>
<P>13. If we would live peaceably our
selves, we should endeavour to preserve
peace, and prevent differences, and re∣concile
dissensions among others, by
doing good offices, and making fair re∣presentations
of intercurrent passages be∣tween
them; by concealing causes of
future disgust, and removing present
misunderstandings, and excusing past
mistakes; by allaying their passions, and
rightly informing their minds, by friend∣ly
intercessions, and pacifick advices.
For the fire that devoureth our neigh∣bours
house threatneth and endangereth
ours, and it is hard to approach conten∣tion
without being engaged therein.
'Tis not easie to keep our selves indiffe∣rent
or neutral, and doing so we shall in
likelihood be maligned and persecuted
by both the contending parties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 5. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Blessed
are the peace-makers,</HI> saith our <HI>Saviour;
for they shall be called the sons of God;</HI>
<PB N="260" REF="134"/>
that is, they shall be highly esteemed
and reverenced for this divine quality,
wherein they so nearly resemble the
God of peace, and his blessed Son the
great Mediatour: but farther, without
respect to other recompence, and from
the nature of their employment, such
are immediately happy, and in this their
vertuous practice rewards it self, that
by appeasing others quarrels, they save
themselves from trouble, and enjoy them∣selves
that tranquillity which they pro∣cure
to others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">To the Coun∣sellours of peace is joy.</NOTE>. But those informing
Sycophants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 12. 20.</NOTE> those internuncio's of pesti∣lent
tales, and incendiaries of discord,
that (from bad nature, or upon base de∣sign)
by the still breath of clandestine
whispers, or by the more violent blasts
of impudent calumnies kindle the flames
of dissension, or foment them among
others; that, by disseminating infamous
rumours, and by malicious suggestions,
instill jealousies into, and nourish male∣volent
surmises in the minds of men,
<HI>separating</HI> (as it is in the <HI>Proverbs) be∣tween
chief friends,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 16. 28.</NOTE> and widening the
distance between others; These (I say)
from the seeds of variance they scatter
among others, reap in the end mischief
and disturbance to themselves; nor can
<PB N="261" REF="134"/>
expect to enjoy the benefit of that quiet,
which they labour to deprive others of.
<HI>The beginning of strife</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon)
is as when one letteth out water;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 17. 14.</NOTE> and he
that to the intent his neighbours Lands
should be overflown with a torrent of
dissension, doth unloose the damms, and
cut the banks of former friendship, may
(if he be wise) expect the merciless floud
should at length reach himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 25. 8.</NOTE> and that
his own habitation should be at last sur∣rounded
therewith. For when men at
length begin to be weary, and to repent
of their needless quarrels, and the mis∣chievous
consequences attending them,
and to be inquisitive into the causes and
instruments of their vexation, they will
certainly find out, detest and invert the
edge of their displeasure upon these
wretched makebates; and so the poison
they mingled for others they themselves
drink up;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid.</NOTE> the Catastrophe of the Tra∣gedy

<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> If we would effectually ob∣serve
this Precept, we must readily com∣ply
<PB N="262" REF="135"/>
with the innocent customs, and
obey the established laws of the places
where we live. I say first comply with
the customs; which also are in effect
inferiour laws enacted by the tacit a∣greement
of the generality of men; the
non-observation of which is upon many
accompts very prejudicial to peaceable
life. For to those concerned in it, it
will always seem to intimate a squeamish
niceness a froward perverseness, an arro∣gant
self-conceitedness, a manifest despi∣sing
other mens judgments, and a vir∣tual
condemning their practices of fault
or folly, and consequently a monopoli∣zing
all goodness, and appropriating all
wisedom to himself; qualities intole∣rably
odious to men and productive of
enmity. It incenses the people (hugely
susceptive of provocation) with a sense
of notable injury done, and contempt
cast upon it. For the onely authority,
which the commonalty can lay claim to,
consists in prescribing Rules of decency
in language, habit, gesture, ceremony,
and other circumstances of action, de∣clared
and ratified by ordinary practice;
non-conformity to which is by them ad∣judged
a marvellous irregularity, contu∣macy,
and rebellion against the Majesty
<PB N="263" REF="135"/>
of the people, and is infallibly revenged
and punished by them.</P>
<P>There's no preserving peace, nor pre∣venting
broils and stirs, but by punctu∣ally
observing that ordinary Rule of
equity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id agamus, ut meliorem vitam sequa∣mur quàm vulgus non ut contrariam, alioqui quos emendari vo∣lumus fuga∣mus &amp; à no∣bis averti∣mus.</NOTE> That in cases of doubtfull de∣bate,
and points of controverted practice,
the fewest should yield to the most, the
weakest bend to the strongest, and that
to the greatest number should be allow∣ed
at least the greates appearance of
reason. To which purpose we may ob∣serve,
that the best and wisest men,
(not to displease those with whom they
conversed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperetur vita inter bo∣nos mores &amp; publicos, &amp;c. <HI>Sen.</HI> Epist. 5.</NOTE> as far as their Duty to God,
and their conscience would permit) have
commonly in their manners of life fol∣lowed
not what in their retired judg∣ment
they most approved, but what
suted to the customs of their times and
places, avoiding a morose singularity as
offensive to others, and productive of
disquiet to themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. ad <HI>Att.</HI> Lib. 2. Ep. 1.</NOTE> You know how
<HI>Cicero</HI> censured <HI>Cato</HI> for endeavouring
against the grain, and predominant <HI>ge∣nius</HI>
of those times to reduce things to
a strict agreement with his private no∣tions:
<HI>Ille optimo animo utens, &amp; summâ
fide nocet interdum Reipublicae. Dicit
enim tanquam in Platonis <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, non
<PB N="264" REF="136"/>
tanquam in Romuli foece sententiam.</HI>
But a more clear and pertinent instance
we have in Saint <HI>Paul;</HI> who thus re∣presents
his own practice:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 22. 10. 33.</NOTE> <HI>I have made
my self a servant to all: Vnto the Jews
I became as a Jew; to them that are
without law as without law: To the
weak became I as weak: I am made all
things to all men, that I might by all
means save some.</HI> Saint <HI>Paul</HI> wisely
knew,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Act. 21.</NOTE> that by a prudent compliance
with mens customs, and condescension
to their capacities, he engaged to him,
or at least did not alienate from him
their affections; and thereby became
more capable of infusing good Doctrine
into their minds, and promoting their
spiritual good. And the same course
was generally taken by the primitive
Christians, who in all things (not in∣consistent
with the rules and principles
of their Religion) did industriously con∣form
their conversation to the usual
practices of men; thereby shunning
those scandalous imputations of pride
and perversness, which then rendred the
Jews so odious to the world, as appears
by divers passages in the ancient Apo∣logists
for Christian Religion: particu∣larly
<HI>Justin Martyr</HI> (in his Epistle to
<PB N="265" REF="136"/>
<HI>Diognetus)</HI> hath these words: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.
The Christians neither in dwelling, lan∣guage,
or customs differ from the rest of
men; they neither inhabit towns proper
to themselves, nor use any peculiar dia∣lect,
nor exercise an uncouth manner of
living, but as by chance it is allotted to
them, inhabiting cities belonging both to
Greeks and Barbarians, comply with the
customs of the country.</HI> And much more
hath he there; and much <HI>Tertullian</HI> like∣wise
in his <HI>Apologetick,</HI> to the same pur∣pose.
Neither do we find in the life of
our Saviour, that exact pattern of all
wisedom and goodness, that in any thing
he did affect to differ from the received
customs of his time and country, ex∣cept
such as were grounded upon vain
conceits, extreamly prejudicial to piety,
or directly repugnant thereto.</P>
<P>And I cannot except from this Rule
the compliance with religious customs
used in the Worship and Service of God:
<PB N="266" REF="137"/>
since a wilfull discrepancy from them
doth much more destroy peace, and
kindle the flame of contention, in as
much as men are apt to apprehend them∣selves
much more slighted and more
condemned by a disagreement in those,
than in matters of lesser concernment.
And it cannot reasonably be imagined,
that the God of love and peace, who
questionless delights to see men converse
in peace and amity, and who therefore
in general terms enjoyns us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14. 19.</NOTE> to pursue
the things that make for peace (where∣of
certainly in reason and to experience,
following indifferent and harmless cu∣stoms,
not expresly repugnant to his
law, nor to the dictates of natural rea∣son,
is one thing, and not the least) in
our addresses to himself (partly designed
and mainly serving more strictly to unite,
not to dissociate men in affection) should
dislike, or disapprove the use of this
course so expedient and conducible to
peace: especially since he infinitely more
regards the substance of the Duty, and
the devotion of the heart therein, than
the manner or any circumstantial ap∣pendages
thereof: 'Tis certain however,
that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> intimates a wilfull de∣parture
from ordinary practice in such
<PB N="267" REF="137"/>
cases, to proceed from a contentious
disposition:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 16.</NOTE> <HI>But if any man</HI> (saith he)
<HI>have a mind to be contentious</HI> (so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
imports) <HI>we have no such
custom, nor the Churches of God.</HI></P>
<P>But yet much more is peaceable con∣versation
impeached by disobedience to
established Laws, those great bulwarks
of Society, fences of Order, and sup∣ports
of Peace; which he that refuses
to obey, is so far from living peaceably
with all men, that he may reasonably
be presumed unwilling to have peace
with any man; since in a manner he
defies all mankind, vilifies its most so∣lemn
Judgments, endeavours to dissolve
those sacred bands, by which its union
is conteined, and to subvert the onely
foundations of publick tranquillity. He
declares himself either to affect an uni∣versal
tyranny over, or an abhorrency
from society with other men, to be un∣willing
to live with them upon equal
terms, or to submit to any fair arbitra∣tion,
to desire that strifes should be end∣less
and controversies never decided, who
declines the verdict of Law, the most
solemn issue of deliberate advice, pro∣ceeding
from the most honourable, most
wise, most worthy, and select persons,
<PB N="268" REF="138"/>
and involving in it the consent of the
whole Commonwealth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 2.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Paul</HI> di∣recting
that prayers should be made for
Princes, and those in Authority, assigns
the reason, <HI>that we may lead a quiet and
a peaceable life in all godliness and ho∣nesty:</HI>
And certainly if we are to pray
for, we are also obliged to obey them
in order to the same end, which to do
is absolutely in our power, and more
immediately requisite to that purpose.
For as no peace can be preserved without
the influence of authority; so no autho∣rity
can subsist without obedience to its
sanctions. He that is desirous to enjoy
the privileges of this happy estate of
peace, must in reason be content to per∣form
the Duties injoined, and bear the
common burthens imposed by those who
are the protectours of it.</P>
<P>Thus as plainly as I could have I de∣scribed
what it is to live peaceably, and
what the means are that principally con∣duce
thereto: I should now proceed to
consider the Object of the Duty, and the
Reasons why it respects all men: As also
whence it comes, that sometimes we
may fail in our endeavour of attaining
this desirable condition: And lastly to
propound some Inducements persuasive
<PB N="269" REF="138"/>
of its practice. But I must not farther
encroach on your patience, and shall
therefore reserve these things to the next
opportunity.</P>
<P>Now: The peace of God, which passeth
all understanding, keep your hearts and
minds in the knowledge and love of God,
and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord;
and the blessing of God Almighty, the Fa∣ther,
Son and Holy Ghost be among you,
and remain with you always. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<Q>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Have very lately considered what
it is to <HI>live peaceably,</HI> and what are
the Duties included therein; and
what Means conduce thereto.</P>
<P>II. I proceed now to consider the Ob∣ject
thereof, and why the duty of living
peaceably extends to <HI>all men,</HI> that is, why
we are bound to bear good-will, and doe
good offices, and shew civil respects to
all men: and to endeavour, that all men
reciprocally be well affected toward us.
For it might with some colour of rea∣son
be objected, and said: Why should
I be obliged heartily to love those, that
desperately hate me, to treat them kind∣ly,
that use me despitefully; to help
<PB N="272" REF="140"/>
them, that would hinder me; to re∣lieve
them, that would plunge me into
utter distress; to comfort them, that
delight in my affliction; to be respe∣ctive
to, and tender of their reputation,
who despise, defame, and reproach me:
to be indulgent, and favourable to
them, who are harsh, and rigorous in
their dealings with me; to spare and
pardon them, who with implacable ma∣lice
persecute me? why should I seek
their friendship, who disdainfully reject
mine; why prize their favour, who
scorn mine; why strive to please them,
who purposely offend me? or why
should I have any regard to men void
of all faith, goodness, or desert? And
most of all, why should I be bound to
maintain amicable correspondence with
those, who are professed enemies to pie∣ty,
and vertue, who oppugn truth, and
disturb peace, and countenance vice, er∣rour,
and faction? How can any love,
consent of mind, or communion of good
offices intercede between persons so con∣trarily
disposed? I answer, they may
and ought, and that because the obliga∣tion
to these ordinary performances is
not grounded upon any peculiar re∣spects,
special qualifications, or singular
<PB N="273" REF="140"/>
actions of men, (which are contingent
and variable) but upon the indefectible
score of common humanity. We owe
them, (as the <HI>Philosopher</HI> alledged, when
he dispensed his alms to an unworthy
person) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:
not to the men, but to hu∣mane
nature, resident in them. There
be indeed divers other sorts of love, in
nature and object more restrained, built
upon narrower foundations, and requi∣ring
more extraordinary acts of du∣ty,
and respect (not competent to all
men;) as a love of friendship, founded
upon long acquaintance, sutableness of
disposition, and frequent exchanges of
mutual kindness; a love of gratitude
due to the reception of valuable bene∣fits;
a love of esteem belonging to per∣sons
endued with worth and vertue; a
love of relation resulting from kindred,
affinity, neighbourhood, and other com∣mon
engagements. But the love of be∣nevolence
(which is precedent to these,
and more deeply rooted in nature, more
ancient, more unconfined, and more im∣mutable)
and the duties mentioned con∣sequent
on it, are grounded upon the na∣tural
constitution, necessary properties,
and unalterable condition of humanity,
<PB N="274" REF="141"/>
and are upon several accompts due
thereto.</P>

<PB N="275" REF="141"/>
We were all fashioned according to the
same original <HI>Idea</HI> (resembling God
our common father) all endowed with
the same faculties, inclinations, and af∣fections;
all conspire in the essential,
and more notable ingredients of our
constitution; and are onely distingui∣shed
by some accidental inconsiderable
circumstances, of age, place, colour,
stature, fortune, and the like; in which
we differ as much from our selves in
successions of time. So that what <HI>Ari∣stotle</HI>
said of a friend, is applicable to
every man: Every man is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>Another our-self;</HI> And he that hates

starves a member of

a branch of his own tree.

enormous practice, or signal dis∣courtesy

bands: for as no unkindness of a

<PB N="276" REF="142"/>
or disoblige us from the duties
annexed thereto: so neither upon the
faults,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Deut. 25. 3.—lest thy brother seem vile unto thee.</NOTE> or injuries of any man can we
ground a total dispensation from the
offices of humanity, especially if the in∣juries
be not irreparable, nor the faults
incurable.</P>
<P>2. We are indispensably obliged to
these duties, because the best of our na∣tural
inclinations prompt us to the per∣formance
of them; especially those of
pity and benignity, which are mani∣festly
discernible in all, but most pow∣erfull
and vigorous in the best natures;
and which questionless by the most wise,
and good Author of our beings were
implanted therein both as monitors to
direct, and as spurrs to incite us to the
performance of our duty. For the same
bowels, that in our want of necessary
sustenance, do by a lively sense of pain
informe us thereof, and instigate us to
provide against it; do in like manner
grievously resent the distresses of ano∣ther,
and thereby admonish us of our
duty, and provoke us to relieve them.
Even the stories of calamities, that in
ages long since past have happened to
persons, no-wise related to us, yea the
fabulous reports of tragical events, do
<PB N="277" REF="142"/>
(even against the bent of our wills, and
all resistance of reason) melt our hearts
with compassion, and draw tears from
our eyes: and thereby evidently signify
that general sympathy, which naturally
interceeds between all men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fince we
can neither see, nor hear or, nor ima∣gine

<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) And certain∣ly
no kind of actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. M. Ant.</NOTE> a man can per∣forme,
<PB N="278" REF="143"/>
are attended with a more pure,
more perfect, more savoury delight, then
those of beneficence are. Since nature
therefore hath made our neighbours mi∣sery
our pain, and his content our plea∣sure;
since with indissoluble bands of
mutuall sympathy she hath concate∣nated
our fortunes, and affections toge∣ther;
since by the discipline of our sense
she instructs us, and by the importunity
thereof solicits us to the observance of
our duty, let us follow her wise directi∣ons,
and conspire with her kindly mo∣tions;
let us not stifle, or weaken by
disuse, or contrary practice, but by con∣formable
action cherish and confirm the
good inclinations of nature.</P>
<P>3. We are obliged to these duties up∣on
account of common equity. We
have all (the most sowre and Stoical of
us all) implanted in us a naturall ambi∣tion,
and a desire (which we can by no
means eradicate) of being beloved, and
respected by all; and are disposed in
our need to demand assistance, commi∣seration
of our misfortunes, and relief
in our distress of all that are in capacity
to afford them; and are apt to be vehe∣mently
displeased, to think our selves
hardly dealt with, and to complain of
<PB N="279" REF="143"/>
cruelty and inhumanity in those that re∣fuse
them to us: and therefore in all rea∣son
and equity we should readily pay
the same love, respect, aid, and comfort
to others, which we expect from others;
for <HI>Beneficium qui dare nescit, injustè
petit:</HI> Nothing is more unreasonable, or
unequal, then to require from others
those good turns, which upon like occa∣sion
we are unwilling to render to o∣thers.</P>
<P>4. We are obliged to these duties of
humanity, upon accompt of common in∣terest,
benefit, and advantage. The
welfare, and safety, the honour, and re∣putation,
the pleasure, and quiet of our
lives are concerned in our maintaining a
loving correspondence with all men. For
so uncertain is our condition, so obnoxi∣ous
are we to manifold necessities, that
there is no man, whose good-will we may
not need, whose good word may not
stand us in stead, whose helpfull indeavour
may not sometime oblige us. The Great
<HI>Pompey,</HI> the glorious Triumpher over
Nations, and admired darling of for∣tune,
was beholden at last to a slave for
the composing his ashes, and celebrating
his funeral obsequies. The honour of
the greatest men depends on the estima∣tion
<PB N="280" REF="144"/>
of the least, and the good-will of the
meanest peasant is a brighter ornament
to the fortune, a greater accession to
the grandeur of a Prince, than the
most radiant gemme in his royall dia∣dem.
However the spite and enmity
of one (and him the most weak other∣wise
and contemptible) person, may
happen to spoil the content of our whole
life, and deprive us of the most comfor∣table
enjoyments thereof; may divert
our thoughts from our delightfull im∣ployments
to a solicitous care of self-pre∣servation,
and defence; may discompose
our minds with vexatious passions; may
by false reports, odious suggestions, and
slanderous defamations blast our credit,
raise a storm of general hatred, and con∣jure
up thousands of enemies against us;
may by insidious practices supplant, and
undermine us, prejudice our welfare, en∣danger
our estate, and involve us in a
bottomless gulf of trouble: it is but rea∣sonable
therefore, if we desire to live se∣curely,
comfortably, and quietly, that
by all honest means we should endeavour
to purchase the good-will of all men, and
provoke no mans enmity needlesly;
since any mans love may be usefull, and
every mans hatred is dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="144"/>
5. We are obliged to these duties by
a tacit compact, and fundamental con∣stitution
of mankind, in pursuance of
those principal designes, for which men
were incorporated, and are still contained
in civil society. For to this purpose do men
congregate, cohabite, and combine them∣selves
in sociable communion, that thereby
they may enjoy a delightfull conversation,
void of fear, free from suspicion, and
free from danger; promote mutual ad∣vantage,
and satisfaction; be helpfull,
and beneficial each to other: abstracting
from which commodities the retirements
of a cloyster, or the solitudes of a de∣sert;
the life of a recluse, or of a wild
beast, would perhaps be more desirable,
then these of gregarious converse: For as
men being pleased and well affected to
each other, are the most obliging friends,
and pleasant companions; so being en∣raged,
they are the most mischievous, and
dangerous neighbours, the most fierce
and savage enemies. By neglecting
therefore, or contravening these duties
of humanity, we frustrate the main ends
of society, disappoint the expectations of
each other, subvert the grounds of ordi∣nary
civility, and in the commonwealth
deal as unpolitickly, as the members in
<PB N="282" REF="145"/>
the body should act unnaturally, in sub∣tracting
mutual assistance, or harming
each other; as if the eye should deny to
the hands the direction of sight, and the
hands in revenge should pluck out the
eyes.</P>
<P>6. We are by observing these rules to
oblige, and render men well affected to
us, because being upon such terms with
men conduceth to our living (not only
delightfully and quietly, but) honestly
and religiously in this world. How
peace, and edification, spiritual comfort,
and temporal quiet do concurr, and co∣operate,
we see intimated <HI>Act. 9. 31.
Then had the Churches peace throughout
all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and
were edifyed, and walking in the fear of
the Lord, and in the comfort of the Ho∣ly
Ghost were multiplied.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> advi∣sed
the Christians of his times, liable to
persecution, <HI>to make prayers for all men</HI>
(and <HI>especially for those in eminent power,)</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2. 2.</NOTE>
<HI>that they might lead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (a retired and quiet life)</NOTE> <HI>a quiet and peacea∣ble
life in all godliness, and honesty;</HI> to pray
for them, that is, to pray that they might
be so disposed, as not to molest, inter∣rupt,
or discourage them in the exercise
of vertue, and practice of piety. For
these by a tranquillity of mind, a sedate∣ness
<PB N="283" REF="145"/>
of affections, a competency of rest
and leisure and retirement, a freedom
from amazing fear, distracting care, and
painfull sense are greatly advanced; of
which advantages by contentious broiles
and enmities we are deprived, and en∣cumbred
with the contrary impediments.
They breed thorny anxieties, and by
them choak the seeds of good intention:
they raise dusky fumes of melancholy,
by them intercepting the beams of spiri∣tual
light, and stifling the flames of devout
affection. By them our thoughts are
affixed upon the basest, and taken off
from the most excellent objects; our
fancies are disordered by turbulent ani∣mosities;
our time is spent, and our en∣deavour
taken up in the most ungrate∣full,
and unprofitable imployments, of
defeating the attempts, resisting the as∣saults,
disproving the calumnies, coun∣termining
the plots of adversaries; They
bring us upon the stage against our will,
and make us act parts in Tragedies, nei∣ther
becoming, nor delighting us. They
disturbe often our natural rest, and hin∣der
us in the dispatch of our ordinary
business; and much more impeach the
steadiness of our devotion, and obstruct
the course of religious practice. They
<PB N="284" REF="146"/>
tempt us also to omissions of our duty, to
unseemingly behaviour, and to the com∣missions
of grievous sin; to harsh cen∣sure,
envious detraction, unwarrantable,
revenge, repining at the good successes,
and delighting in the misfortunes of o∣thers.
Many examples occurr in histo∣ry,
like those of <HI>Hanno</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian,</HI>
and <HI>Quint. Metellus (Pompeys</HI> antagonist)
who in pursuance of some private grud∣ges,
have not only betrayed their own
interests, and sullyed their own reputa∣tions;
but notably disserved, and dam∣nifyed
the publick weale of their coun∣try:
And so will our being engaged in
enmity with men cause us to neglect, if
not to contradict our dearest concern∣ments:
Whence we should carefully a∣void
the occasions thereof, and by an in∣nocent
and beneficent conversation oblige
men to a friendly correspondence with us.</P>
<P>7. We are obliged to perform these
duties of humanity, because by so doing
we become more capable of promoting
goodness in others, and so of fulfilling
the highest duties of Christian Charity;
of successfully advising and admonishing
others; of instructing their ignorance,
and convincing their mistakes; of re∣moving
their prejudices, and satisfying
<PB N="285" REF="146"/>
their scruples; of reclaiming them from
vice, errour, faction; and reconciling
them to vertue, truth, and peace. For
by no force of reason, or stratagem of
wit are men so easily subdued, by no
bait so thoroughly allured and caught,
as by reall courtesy, gentleness and af∣fability;
as on the other side, by a sowre
and peevish humour, supercilious looks,
bitter language, and harsh dealing men
are rendred indocile, and intractable, a∣verse
from better instruction, obstinate
in their ways, and pertinacious in their
conceits. Easily do men swallow the
pill gilded with fair carriage, and sweet∣ned
by kind speech; readily do they
afford a favourable ear to the advice see∣ming
to proceed from good-will, and a
tender care of their good; But the phy∣sick
of wholesome admonition being
steeped in the vinegar of reproach, and
tempered with the gall of passion, be∣comes
distastfull and loathsome to the
patient; neither will men willingly li∣sten
to the reasonings of those, whom
they apprehend disaffected to their per∣sons,
and more desirous to wound their
reputations, than to cure their distem∣pers.
The slightest argument, the most
simple and unpolished oration issuing
<PB N="286" REF="147"/>
from the mouth of a freind, is wonder∣fully
more prevalent, than the strongest
demonstration, than the most powerfull
eloquence of an enemy. For obliging
usage, and courteous speech unlock the
affections, and by them insinuate into
the reason of men; but surly deport∣ment,
and froward expressions damme
up the attention with prejudice, and in∣terclude
all avenues to the understanding.
An illustration of which discourse we
have from comparing the different prac∣tice
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the ancient <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI>
with the contrary successes there∣of.
The <HI>Jews</HI> by their seditious, and
turbulent practices, by their insolent con∣tempt,
and implacable hatred of others
(for you know what <HI>Tacitus</HI> saith of them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. lib. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>Apud ipsos fides obstinata, misericordia
in promptu, sed adversus omnes alios
hostile odium)</HI> by their perverse and
unsociable humours, declining all enter∣course,
and refusing ordinary offices of
humanity (so much as to shew the way,
or to direct the thirsty traveller to the
fountain) to any not of their own sect,
did procure an <HI>odium,</HI> scorn, and infamy
upon their religion, rendred all men a∣verse
from inquiring into, or entertai∣ning
any good opinion thereof, and so
<PB N="287" REF="147"/>
very little inlarged its bounds, and gai∣ned
few proselytes thereto. But the
<HI>Christians</HI> by a mild, patient, and peace∣able
behaviour; by obedience to laws,
and complyance with harmless customs;
by perfect innocence, and
abstinence from doing injury;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thus the ancient Chri∣stians; but when religion declined, dissension and ill-will did grow; so that the heathen Historian <HI>(Am. Marc. lib. 22.)</HI> could say of <HI>Julian: Nullas infest as hominibus bestias, ut sunt si∣bi ferales pleri{que} Christiano∣rum, expertus.</HI></NOTE>
by paying due respects, and
performing civill offices, and
demonstrations of benevo∣lence;
by loving conversati∣on,
and friendly commerce
with all, commended their
doctrine to the regard of men:
and by this only piece of Rhe∣torick
(without terrour of arms, or
countenance of power, or plausibility of
discourse, or promise of temporal re∣ward)
subdued the faith of men, and
persuaded a great part of the world to
embrace their excellent profession.</P>
<P><Q>We converse with you like men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertul. <HI>Apol.</HI></NOTE> we
use the same diet, habit, and necessary
furniture: We have recourse to your tri∣bunals;
we frequent your markets, your
fairs, your shops, your stalls, your sham∣bles,
your baths: We cohabit, we saile,
we warr, we till, we trade, we maintaine
all manner of commerce with you</Q> saith
the Christian <HI>Apologist,</HI> to the <HI>Pagans,</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="148"/>
in behalf of the ancient Christians.
Which kind of practice they derived not
only from the sweet temper and noble
<HI>Genius</HI> of their Religion, but from the
express institution of the first teachers
thereof, and from their exemplary prac∣tice
therein. For both by doctrine did
the Apostles exhort, and by their exam∣ple
incite them to adorne the Gospel, and
render the discipline of Christ amiable
by their meek, gentle, compliant and
inoffensive conversation; and thereby to
allure others to a willing entertainment
thereof. To this purpose are those ex∣hortations.
<HI>Phil. 4. 5. Let your modera∣tion</HI>

us doe good to all men:</HI> and <HI>Tit. 3. 1. Put
them in mind to be subject to principalities,
and powers, to be ready to every good
work; to reproach no man, not to be con∣tentious,
but gentle, shewing all meekness

of the Lord must not strive, but be
<PB N="289" REF="148"/>
gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient:
In meekness instructing those that oppose
themselves:</HI> (or those that are other∣wise
disposed, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>if
peradventure God will give them repen∣tance
to the acknowledgment of the truth:</HI>
where gentleness toward all, and meek∣ness
toward adversaries are oppositely
conjoyned, with aptness to teach, and
instruct; the one qualification so effectu∣ally
predisposing to the other: and it is
beside intimated that gentle and meek
treatment are sutable instruments ordi∣narily
imployed by God to convert men
from errour to truth.</P>
<P>8. We are bound hereto in comply∣ance
and conformity to the best patterns:
God, Christ, the Apostles, the Primitive
Saints: This illustrious Doctor of Chri∣stian
Religion St. <HI>Paul</HI> did not fail to se∣cond
this his doctrine with his own ex∣ample.
For <HI>Give none offence</HI> (saith he)
<HI>neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles,
nor to the Church of God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10. <HI>ult.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Even as I please
all men in all things, not seeking mine own
profit, but the profit of many, that they
may be saved: Please all men in all things;</HI>
what could St. <HI>Paul</HI> say, or what do
more?<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 19▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> and again. <HI>For though</HI> (saith he)
<HI>I be free from all men, yet have I made
<PB N="290" REF="149"/>
my self a servant unto all, that I might
gain the more: To the weak became I
as weak, that I might gain the weak: I
am made all things to all men, that by all
means I might save some.</HI> See how far
this charitable design of doing good to o∣thers
transported him: He parted with
his own freedome, that he might redeem
them from the slavery of a wicked life;
He denyed his own present satisfaction
that he might procure them a lasting con∣tent:
he despised his own profit, that he
might promote their spiritual advantage;
He prostituted his own reputation, that
he might advance them to a condition
of true glory. He underwent grievous
afflictions for their comfort; sustained
restless pains for their ease, and hazar∣ded
his own safety for their salvation.
He condescended to their infirmities,
suted his demeanour to their tempers,
complyed with their various humours,
and contrary customs: He differed from
himself, that he might agree with them,
and transformed himself into all shapes,
that he might convert them into what
they should be, reform their manners, and
translate them into a happy estate. But
above all is the practice of our Lord him∣self
most remarkable to this purpose: and
<PB N="291" REF="149"/>
discovers plainly to him that observes
an universally large, and unrestrained
<HI>Philanthropie.</HI> For having from a won∣derfull
conspiracy of kindness and good∣will
(between him and his eternal Fa∣ther)
toward the world of men, descen∣ded
willingly from the throne of his ce∣lestial
Majesty, and inveloped his divine
glory in a cloud of mortal frailty, and
<HI>that</HI> (as the <HI>Apostle</HI> saith) <HI>he might re∣concile
all things in heaven and earth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coloss. 1. 20.</NOTE>
conjoine God and man by a nearer alli∣ance,
and unite men together by the
more sacred bands of common relation
to himself: Having assumed not only the
outward shape and corporeal resemblance
of man, but the inward frame, and real
passions of humane souls; he disdained
not accordingly to obey the laws, to
follow the inclinations, to observe the
duties of the best and most perfect huma∣nity;
with an equall and impartiall boun∣ty
imparting free admittance, familiar
converse, friendly aid and succour unto
all, even the worst of men in all appea¦rance
(and that so far, that some rigo∣rous
censurers thence presumed to taxe
him as <HI>a glutton;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 11. 19.</NOTE> <HI>and a good fellow, a
friend to publicans, and sinners)</HI> distri∣buting
liberally to all the incomparable
<PB N="292" REF="150"/>
benefits of his heavenly doctrine, of his
holy example, of his miraculous power;
instructing the ignorances, detecting the
errours, dispossessing the devils; sustain∣ing
the weaknesses, overlooking the inju∣ries,
comforting the afflictions, supplying
the necessities, healing the diseases, and re∣medying
all the miseries of all, that did
not wilfully reject their own welfare:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 10. 38.</NOTE> <HI>He
went about</HI> (saith St. <HI>Peter</HI> in the <HI>Acts)
doing good, and healing all that were op∣pressed
of the devil:</HI> And<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Matt. 9. 35.</NOTE> <HI>He went a∣bout
all the cities and villages teaching in
their Synagogues, and preaching the Go∣spell
of the Kingdom, and healing every
sickness, and every disease among the
people</HI> (saith St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Gospel.)
He despised not the meanest, either in
outward estate, or spiritual improvement.
He invited all unto him, repelled, or
discouraged none; nor refused to any
that came unto him, his counsell, or his
help. He was averse from no mans so∣ciety
(and if in any degree from any, chief∣ly
from those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 18. 9.</NOTE> who confidently preten∣ded
to extraordinary sanctity, and proud∣ly
contemned others.) Meek and gentle
he was, mild and patient; courteous and
benigne; lowly and condescensive; ten∣der
and compassionate in his conversation
<PB N="293" REF="150"/>
unto all. And for a compliment of his tran∣scendent
charity, and for an enforcement
unto ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8. 21.</NOTE> he laid down his life for us all,
as a common price to purchase remission of
sins; a general ransome to redeem the hu∣mane
creation from the captivity of hell,
and slavery of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the sons of God; demolishing by
his pacifick death all partition walls, and
laying open all enclosures of the divine fa∣vour;
reconciling God to man, and com∣bining
man to himself by the fresh ce∣ment
of his pretious bloud: so that now
not only as fellow-creatures; but (which
is exceedingly more) as partakers of the
same common redemption, as objects of
the same mercy, as obliged in the same
common debt, and as capable of the same
eternal happiness, by new and firmer en∣gagements
we are bound to all mutual
kindness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14.</NOTE> and benevolence toward all.
For <HI>Destroy not</HI> (saith St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and by like
reason I may say, Harm not, vex not, be
not unkind to) <HI>him, for whom Christ dyed.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, farther we have the example of
Almighty God himself directing, and
by our Saviours express admonition ob∣liging
us to this universal beneficence,
compassion, and patience towards all.
Who by express testimony of sacred
<PB N="294" REF="151"/>
writ, and by palpable sings of conti∣nual
experience declareth himself to be
a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tit. 3. 4. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> lover of mankind; to be good to
all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 145. 9.</NOTE> and tenderly mercifull over all his
works: not to afflict willingly, nor
grieve the children of men: to com∣passionate
the miseries, and supply the
needs, and relieve the distresses; to de∣sire
the salvation, and to delight in the
happiness of men. Who with an indif∣ferent,
unlimited munificence dispenseth
his blessings, extends his watchfull pro∣vidence,
and imparts his loving care un∣to
all: Causing his Sun with comforta∣ble
beams to shine, and the refreshing
showres to descend upon, the earth to
yield her pleasant fruits; the temperate
seasons to recurr, and all the elements
to minister succour, joy, and satisfaction
even to the most impious,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Clement.</NOTE> and ingrate∣full

clemency and long-sufferance overlooks

and incessantly solicits the recon∣cilement,
courts the amity, and in a
manner begs the good-will of his most
<PB N="295" REF="151"/>
deadly enemies: whom he hath always
in his hand, and can crush to nothing
at his pleasure. For, <HI>We are Ambassa∣dours
for Christ, as if God by us did entreat
you: We beseech you in Christ's behalf; be
reconciled to God</HI> (saith Saint <HI>Paul.)</HI></P>
<P>Since therefore upon accompt of na∣tural
consanguinity, of our best incli∣nations,
of common equity, and gene∣ral
advantage, and an implicite com∣pact
between men; of securing our,
and promoting other's vertue and pie∣ty;
from the exhortations of Scripture
mentioned, and many more tending to
the same purpose, from the example of
the ancient Christians, the Leaders, and
Champions of our Religion, of the Apo∣stles,
the Masters and Patriarchs there∣of,
of our Blessed Redeemer, and of Al∣mighty
God himself, we are obliged to
this Universal benevolence, and benefi∣cence
toward all; No misapprehensions
of judgment, no miscarriages in practice,
no ill-dispositions of soul, no demerits
in himself, no discourtesies toward us
ought wholly to alienate our affections
from, or to avert us from doing good,
or to incline us to render evil for evil
unto any person; especially considering,
that the omissions of others, cannot ex∣cuse
<PB N="296" REF="152"/>
us from the performance of our
duty; that no man is to be presumed
incorrigible, nor (like the lapsed An∣gels)
concluded in desperate impeni∣tence;
and that our loving and gentle
demeanour toward them may be instru∣mental
to their amendment, and the
contrary may contribute to their pro∣gress
and continuance in offences; that
God hath promised to us a reward of
our patience, and hath reserved to them
a reason of judgment and punishment,
if they persist obstinate in their disor∣derly
courses; that to avenge their tres∣passes
belongs not to us, but to Almigh∣ty
God, who is more nearly concerned
in, and more injured by them, and is
yet content to endure them, to prolong
their lives, to continue his benefits to
them, and to expect their conversion:
That our differing from them is not to
be attributed to our selves, but wholly,
or chiefly to the goodness of God; that
we always were, are, and shall be lia∣ble
to the same errours, vices, and mis∣demeanours:
that (lastly) the faults
and follies of others, like the maims of
body, distempers of soul, or crosses of
fortune (being their own greatest un∣happinesses)
require rather our pity then
<PB N="297" REF="152"/>
our hatred, to be eased by our help,
then aggravated by our unkindness. Tis
too scant therefore and narrow a Cha∣rity
that is limited by correspondence of
courtesy, or by the personal merits of
others: We are bound to live peacea∣bly
with, that is, to be innocent, bene∣ficial,
respective to all, and to seek the
reciprocal good-will, love and amity of
all. But I have insisted too long upon
this particular, concerning the Object
of this duty, and its extension.</P>
<P>III. I proceed briefly to consider
whence it comes, that (as I before ob∣served
was intimated in these words, <HI>If
it be possible, as much as lieth in you)</HI>
though we doe our parts, and perform
carefully the duties incumbent on us,
though we bear good-will, and doe
good offices, and yield due respects,
and abstain from all not onely injuri∣ous,
but rigorous dealings toward all;
though we revile none, nor censure
harshly, nor presumptuosly intermed∣dle
with others affairs; though we obey
laws, and comply with received cu∣stoms,
and avoid all occasions of con∣tention,
though our tempers be meek,
our principles peaceable, and our con∣versations
<PB N="298" REF="153"/>
inoffensive, we may yet
prove successless in our endeavours to
live peaceably, and may be hated,
harmed, and disquieted in our course of
life. That it so happens, we find by
plain experience, and manifold exam∣ple.
For <HI>Moses, the meekest man upon
earth,</HI> and commended beside by all
circumstances of divine favour, and hu∣mane
worth, was yet often envied, im∣pugned,
and molested by those, whom by
all manner of benefits he had most high∣ly
obliged. And we find <HI>David</HI> frequent∣ly
complaining, that by those, whose
good-will by performing all offices of
friendly kindness, and brotherly affec∣tion,
he had studiously laboured to
deserve,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Ps. 55. 10.</NOTE> whose maladies and calamities
he had not onely tenderly commisera∣ted,
but had prayed and humbled his
soul with fasting for their recovery and
deliverance from them, was yet recom∣pensed
by their treacherous devices a∣gainst
his safety, by grievous reproa∣ches,
and scornfull insultings over him
in his affliction; as we see at large in
<HI>Psalms</HI> the 35. and 69. And in <HI>Psalm
120.</HI> he thus lamentably bemoans his
condition: <HI>Woe is me that I sojourn in
Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Ke∣dar:
<PB N="299" REF="153"/>
My soul hath long dwelt with him
that hateth peace: I am for peace but
when I speak, they are for war:</HI> And
our Blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> himself, though in
the whole tenour of his life he demon∣strated
an incomparable meekness and
sweetness of disposition, and exercised
continually all manner of kindness and
beneficence toward all men, was not∣withstanding
loaded with all kinds of
injuries and contumelies, was bitterly
hated, ignominiously disgraced, and
maliciously persecuted unto death: and
the same lot befell his faithfull <HI>Disciples,</HI>
that although their design was benign
and charitable, their carriage blameless
and obliging toward all, they were yet
pursued constantly both by the outragi∣ous
clamours of the people, and cruel
usages from those in eminent power.
Now though it seem strange and al∣most
incredible, that they who are tru∣ly
friends to all, and are ready to doe
to all what good they can; who wil∣lingly
displease none, but industri∣ously
strive to acquire (not with glo∣zing
shews of popularity, but by real
expressions of kindness) the good-will
and favour of all, should yet be malig∣ned,
or molested by any; yet seeing it
<PB N="300" REF="154"/>
so happens, if we inquire into the rea∣son,
we shall find this miracle in mo∣rality,
to proceed (to omit the neglect
of the duties mentioned in our former
discourse) chiefly from the exceeding
variety, difference and contrariety of
mens dispositions, joyned with the mo∣rosity,
aptness to mistake, envy, or un∣reasonable
perverseness of some; which
necessarily render the means of attain∣ing
all mens good-will insufficient, and
the endeavours unsuccessfull. For men
seeing by several lights, relishing with
diversly disposed palates, and measuring
things by different standards, we can
hardly doe or say any thing, which if
approved and applauded by some, will
not be disliked and blamed by others;
if it advance us in the opinion of some,
will not as much depress us in the judg∣ment
of others; so that in this irrecon∣cileable
diversity and inconsistency of
mens apprehensions, it is impossible not
to displease many: Especially since some
men either by their natural temper, or
from the influence of some sowre prin∣ciples
they have imbibed, are so mo∣rose,
rigid, and self-willed; so impatient
of all contradiction to, or discrepancy
from their sentiments, that they cannot
<PB N="301" REF="154"/>
endure any to dissent in judgment, or
vary in practice from them, without
incurring their heavy disdain and cen∣sure.
And which makes the matter
more desperate and remediless, such
men commonly being least able either
to manage their reason, or to command
their passion, as guided wholly by cer∣tain
blind impulses of fancy, or ground∣less
prejudices of conceit, or by a par∣tial
admiration of some mens persons,
examples, and authorities, are usually
most resolute and peremptory in their
courses, and thence hardly capable of
any change, mitigation, or amendment.
Of which sort there being divers enga∣ged
in several ways, it is impossible to
please some without disgusting the o∣ther;
and difficult altogether to ap∣proach
any of these wasps, without be∣ing
stung, or vexed by them. Some
also are so apt to misunderstand mens
meanings, to misconstrue their words,
and to make ill descants upon, or draw
bad consequences from their actions,
that 'tis not possible to prevent their en∣tertaining
ill-favoured prejudices against
even those that are heartily their friends,
and wish them the best. To others
the good and prosperous estate of their
<PB N="302" REF="155"/>
Neighbour, that he flourishes in wealth,
power or reputation, is ground suffici∣ent
of hatred and enmity against him:
for so we see that <HI>Cain</HI> hated his inno∣cent
brother <HI>Abel,</HI> because his brothers
works were more righteous, and his sa∣crifices
better accepted then his own:
that <HI>Josephs</HI> brethren were mortally of∣fended
at him, because his father espe∣cially
loved, and delighted in him: that
<HI>Saul</HI> was enraged against <HI>David,</HI> be∣cause
his gallant deeds were celebrated
with due praises, and joyfull acclama∣tions
of the people: and that the <HI>Baby∣lonian</HI>
Princes, upon no other score,
maligned <HI>Daniel,</HI> but because he enjoy∣ed
the favour of the King, and a digni∣ty
answerable to his deserts: And who
that loves his own welfare, can possibly
avoid such enmities as these? But the
fatal rock, upon which peaceable de∣signs
are most inevitably split, and
which by no prudent steering our
course can sometimes be evaded, is the
unreasonable perverseness of mens pre∣tences,
who sometimes will upon no
terms be friends with us, or allow us
their good-will, but upon condition of
concurring with them in dishonest, and
unwarrantable practices: of omitting
<PB N="303" REF="155"/>
some duties to which by the express
command of God, or evident dictates
of right reason we are obliged, or per∣forming
some action repugnant to those
indispensable rules. But though peace
with men is highly valuable, and pos∣sessing
their good-will in worth not in∣feriour
to any other indifferent accom∣modation
of life, yet are these nothing
comparable to the favour of God, or the
internall satisfaction of conscience;
nor though we were assured thereby to
gain the entire love and favour of all
men living, are we to purchase them at
so dear a rate as with the loss of these.
We must not to please or gratify men,
commit any thing prohibited, or omit
any thing enjoyned by God, the least
glimpse of whose favourable aspect is
infinitely more to be prized, then the
most intimate friendship of the mighti∣est
Monarchs upon earth: and the least
spark of whose indignation is more to be
dreaded, then the extreamest displeasure
of the whole world. In case of such
competition, we must resolve with Saint
<HI>Paul, Gal. 1. 10. Do I yet</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> <HI>conciliate
God, or do I endeavour to sooth men?
for if I yet soothed</HI> (or flattered) <HI>men</HI>
(so you know <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies) <HI>I were
<PB N="304" REF="156"/>
not the servant of Christ.</HI> Nor are we,
that we may satisfy any mans pleasure,
to contravene the dictates of Reason
(that subordinate guide of our actions)
to doe any dishonourable or uncomely
action, unworthy of a man, misbeseem∣our
education, or incongruous to our
station in humane society, so as to
make our selves worthily despicable to
the most by contenting some: Nor are
we bound always to desert our own
considerable interest, or betray our just
liberty, that we may avoid the enmity
of such as would violently, or fraudu∣lently
encroach upon them. Nor are
we in the administration of justice, di∣stribution
of rewards, or arbitration of
controversies to respect the particular
favour of any, but the merits onely of
the cause, or the worth of the persons
concerned. Nor are we by feeding
mens distempered humours, or gratify∣ing
their abused fancies to prejudice or
neglect their real good; to encourage
them in bad practices, to foment their
irregular passions, to applaud their un∣just
or uncharitable censures, or to puff
up their minds with vain conceit, by
servile flattery: but rather, like faithfull
Physicians, to administer wholsome,
<PB N="305" REF="156"/>
though unsavoury, advice; to reveal
to them their mistakes, to check their
intended progress in bad courses, to re∣prove
their faults seasonably, and when
it may probably doe them good, though
possibly thereby we may provoke their
anger and procure their ill-will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 4. 16.</NOTE> and (as
S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith) become their enemies,
for telling them the truth. Nor are we
ever explicitely to assent to falsehoods
(so apprehended by us,) to bely our
consciences, or contradict our real judg∣ments
(though we may sometimes for
peace-sake prudently conceale them;)
Nor to deny the truth our defence and
patronage, when in order to some good
purpose it needs and requires them,
though thereby we may incurre the
dislike, and forfeit the good-will of
some men. Nor are we by entertain∣ing
any extraordinary friendship, inti∣mate
familiarity, or frequent converse
with persons notoriously dissolute in
their manners, disorderly in their beha∣viour,
or erroneous in weighty points
of opinion, to countenance their misde∣meanours,
dishonour our profession, ren∣der
our selves justly suspected, run the ha∣zard
of contagion, or hinder their refor∣mation.
And especially we are warily to
<PB N="306" REF="157"/>
decline the particular acquaintance of
men of contentious dispositions, mis∣chievous
principles, and factious de∣signs;
a bare keeping company with
whom looks like a conspiracy, an ap∣proving,
or abetting their proceed∣ings;
The refusing any encouragement,
signification of esteem, or vouchsafing
any peculiar respect to such, we owe
to the honour of vertue, which they
disgrace, to the love of truth which
they oppugn, to the peace of the world
which they disturb, and to the general
good of mankind, which they impeach.
And so S. <HI>Paul</HI> warns us not to <HI>mingle</HI>
or consort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5.</NOTE> not to <HI>diet,</HI> or <HI>common</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>&amp;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) with
men of a dissolute and disorderly con∣versation:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
And <HI>to mark them which
cause seditions, and scandals, contrary to
Christian doctrine, and to shun, or de∣cline
them</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) and to
repudiate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 16. 17.</NOTE> deprecate the familiarity of
Hereticks (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3. 10.</NOTE>
And S. <HI>John</HI> forbids us to <HI>wish
joy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Joh. 10.</NOTE> or to allow the ordinary respects
of civil salutation to Apostates, and Im∣postours:
<HI>lest</HI> (by such demonstration
of favour) <HI>we communicate with them in
their wicked works.</HI> None of which
<PB N="307" REF="157"/>
Precepts are intended to interdict to us,
or to disoblige us from bearing real good∣will,
or dispensing needfull benefits to
any, but to deter us from yielding any
signal countenance to vice and impiety;
and to excite us to declare such dislike
and detestation of those heinous enormi∣ties
as may confer to the reclaiming of
these, and prevent the seduction of others.
So Saint <HI>Paul</HI> expresly, 2 <HI>Thess. 3. 14.
But if any man obeyeth not our injunction
by epistle, do not consort with him, that he
may by shame be reclaimed</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>)
And <HI>account him not an enemy, but admo∣nish
him as a brother.</HI> Nor ought <HI>lastly</HI>
the love of peace, and desire of friendly
correspondence with any men, avert us
from an honest zeal, (proportionable to
our abilities and opportunities) of pro∣moting
the concernments of truth and
goodness, though against powerfull and
dangerous opposition: I say an honest
zeal, meaning thereby not that blind
heady passion, or inflammation of spirit,
transporting men beyond the bounds of
reason and discretion, upon some super∣ficially
plausible pretences, to violent and
irregular practices; but a considerate
and steady resolution of mind, effectually
animating a man by warrantable and
<PB N="308" REF="158"/>
decent means vigorously to prosecute
commendable designs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jude 3.</NOTE> like that S. <HI>Jude</HI>
mentions, of <HI>striving earnestly for the
faith once delivered to the Saints.</HI> For
this zeal may be very consistent with,
yea greatly conducible to the designs of
peace. And 'tis not a drousiness, a slack
remissness, a heartless diffidence, or a
cowardly flinching from the face of dan∣ger
and opposition, we discourse about,
or plead for, but a wise and wary decli∣ning
the occasions of needless and un∣profitable
disturbance to our selves and
others.</P>
<P>To conclude this point (which if
time would have permitted, I should
have handled more fully and distinctly)
though to preserve peace, and purchase
the good-will of men, we may and
ought to quit much of our private inte∣rest
and satisfaction, yet ought we not
to sacrifice to them what is not our own,
nor committed absolutely to our dispo∣sal,
and which in value incomparably
transcends them, the maintenance of
truth, the advancement of justice, the
practice of vertue, the quiet of our con∣science,
the favour of Almighty God.
And if for being dutifull to God, and
faithfull to our selves in these particulars,
<PB N="309" REF="158"/>
any men will hate, vex and despite us;
frustrate our desires, and defeat our pur∣poses
of living peaceably with all men in
this world: we may comfort our selves
in the enjoyment of eternal peace and
satisfaction of mind, in the assurance of
the divine favour, in the hopes of eter∣nal
rest and tranquillity in the world to
come.</P>
<P>Now briefly to induce us to the pra∣ctice
of this duty of living peaceably, we
may consider,</P>
<P>1. <HI>How good and pleasant a thing it
is</HI> (as <HI>David</HI> saith) <HI>for brethren</HI> (and so
we are all at least by nature) <HI>to live to∣gether
in unity.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 133. 1.</NOTE> How, that (as <HI>Solomon</HI>
saith) <HI>better is a dry morsel, and quiet∣ness
therewith, then a house full of sacri∣fices
with strife.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 17. 1.</NOTE> How delicious that
conversation is, which is accompanied
with a mutual confidence, freedom,
courtesy, and complacence: how calm
the mind, how composed and affections,
how serene the countenance, how melo∣dious
the voice, how sweet the sleep,
how contentfull the whole life is of him
that neither deviseth mischief against
others, nor suspects any to be contrived
against himself: and contrariwise, how
ingratefull and loathsom a thing it is to
<PB N="310" REF="159"/>
abide in a state of enmity, wrath, dis∣sension:
having the thoughts distracted
with solicitous care, anxious suspicion,
envious regret; the heart boiling with
choler, the face overclouded with discon∣tent,
the tongue jarring and out of tune,
the ears filled with discordant noises of
contradiction, clamour and reproach;
the whole frame of body and soul distem∣pered,
and disturbed with the worst of
passions. How much more comfortable
it is to walk in smooth and even paths,
then to wander in rugged ways, over∣grown
with briars, obstructed with
rubs, and beset with snares; to sail stea∣dily
in a quiet, then to be tost in a tem∣pestuous
Sea; to behold the lovely face
of Heaven smiling with a chearfull sere∣nity,
then to see it frowning with clouds,
or raging with storms; to hear harmo∣nious
consents, then dissonant janglings;
to see objects correspondent in gracefull
symmetry, then lying disorderly in con∣fused
heaps; to be in health, and have
the natural humours consent in mode∣rate
temper, then (as it happens in dis∣eases)
agitated with tumultuous com∣motions:
How all senses and faculties of
man unanimously rejoyce in those em∣blems
of peace, order, harmony, and
<PB N="311" REF="159"/>
proportion. Yea how nature universal∣ly
delights in a quiet stability, or un∣disturbed
progress of motion; the beauty,
strength and vigour of every thing re∣quires
a concurrence of force, cooperati∣on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide <HI>Clem.</HI> ad Cor. pag. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE>
and contribution of help; all things
thrive and flourish by communicating
reciprocal aid, and the world subsists by
a friendly conspiracy of its parts; and
especially that political society of men
chiefly aims at peace as its end, depends
on it as its cause, relies on it as its sup∣port.
How much a peacefull state re∣sembles
Heaven, into which neither
<HI>complaint, pain,</HI> nor <HI>clamour</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
as it is in
the <HI>Apocalypse)</HI> do ever enter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. 21.</NOTE> but
blessed souls converse together in perfect
love, and in perpetual concord; and
how a condition of enmity represents
the state of Hell, that black and dismal
Region of dark hatred, fiery wrath, and
horrible tumult. How like a paradise
the world would be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, then a stalled oxe and ha∣tred there∣with. <HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 17.</NOTE> flourishing in joy
and rest, if men would chearfully con∣spire
in affection, and helpfully contri∣bute
to each others content: and how
like a savage wilderness now it is, when
like wild beasts; they vex and persecute,
worry and devour each other. How
<PB N="312" REF="160"/>
not only Philosophy hath placed the su∣preme
pitch of happiness in a calmness of
mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> and tranquillity of life, void of
care and trouble, of irregular passions
and perturbations; but that Holy Scri∣pture
it self in that one term of peace
most usually comprehends all joy and
content, all felicity and prosperity: so
that the heavenly consort of Angels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 2. 14.</NOTE> when
they agree most highly to bless, and to
wish the greatest happiness to mankind,
could not better express their sense, then
by saying <HI>Be on earth peace, and good∣will
among men.</HI></P>
<P>2. That as nothing is more sweet
and delightfull, so nothing more come∣ly
and agreeable to humane nature then
peaceable living,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 20. 3.</NOTE> it being (as <HI>Solomon</HI>
saith) <HI>an honour to a man to cease from
strife;</HI> and consequently also a disgrace
to him to continue therein: That rage
and fury may be the excellencies of
beasts, and the exerting their natural
animosity in strife and combat may be∣come
them; but reason and discretion
are the singular eminencies of men, and
the use of these the most natural and
commendable method of deciding con∣troversies
among them: and that it ex∣treamly
misbecomes them that are en∣dowed
<PB N="313" REF="160"/>
with those excellent faculties so
to abuse them, as not to apprehend each
others meanings, but to ground vexati∣ous
quarrels upon the mistake of them:
not to be able by reasonable expedients
to compound differences, but with mu∣tual
dammage and inconvenience to pro∣rogue
and encrease them: not to discern
how exceedingly better it is to be help∣full
and beneficial, than to be mischie∣vous
and troublesome to one another,
How foolishly and unskilfully they judg,
that think by unkind speech and harsh
dealing to allay mens distempers, alter
their opinions, or remove their prejudi∣ces;
as if they should attempt to kill by
ministring nourishment, or to extinguish
a flame by pouring oyl upon it. How
childish a thing it is eagerly to contend
about trifles, for the superiority in some
impertinent contest, for the satisfaction
of some petty humour, for the possessi∣on
of some inconsiderable toy: yea how
barbarous and brutish a thing it is to be
fierce and impetuous in the pursuit of
things that please us, snarling at, biting
and tearing all competitors of our game,
or opposers of our undertaking. But
how divine and amiable, how worthy
of humane nature, of civil breeding, of
<PB N="314" REF="161"/>
prudent consideration it is, to restrain
partial desires, to condescend to equal
terms, to abate from rigorous pretences,
to appease discords, and vanquish enmi∣ties
by courtesy and discretion; like the
best and wisest Commanders, who by
skilfull conduct, and patient attendance
upon opportunity, without striking of
stroke of shedding of bloud, subdue their
Enemy.</P>
<P>3. How that peace with its near alli∣ance
and concomitants, its causes and
effects, love, meekness, gentleness and
patience, are in Sacred Writ reputed the
genuine fruits of the Holy Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.</NOTE> issues
of Divine Grace, and off-springs of hea∣venly
Wisedom; producing like them∣selves
a goodly progeny of righteous
deeds. But that emulation, hatred,
wrath, variance and strife derive their
extraction from fleshly lust, hellish craft,
or beastly folly; propagating themselves
also into a like ugly brood of wicked
works.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 3. 14.</NOTE> For so saith Saint <HI>James, If you
have bitter zeal and strife in your hearts,
glory not,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>nor be deceived untruly: This
wisedom descendeth not from above, but
is earthly, sensual, and devilish: For
where emulation and strife are, there is</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, confusion.</NOTE><HI>tumult, and every</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE><HI>naughty thing: but
<PB N="315" REF="161"/>
the wisedom that is from above is first
pure, then peaceable, gentle,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>obsequious,
full of mercy</HI> (or beneficence) <HI>and of
good fruits, without partiality and dissi∣mulation;
And the fruit of righteousness
is sowed in peace to those that make peace:
and from whence are wars, and quarrels
among you? Are they not hence, even
from your lusts, that war in your mem∣bers?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 17. 19.</NOTE>
Likewise, <HI>He loveth trans∣gression
that loveth strife:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 18. 6.</NOTE> and <HI>A fools
lips enter into contention, and his mouth
calleth for strokes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qui posuit in coelo bellum, in paradiso frau∣dem, odium inter primos fratres. <HI>Aug.</HI></NOTE> saith <HI>Solomon.</HI> That

in his practices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 13. 11.</NOTE> to resemble him in
his qualities:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 4. 9.</NOTE> But that the best,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5. 23.</NOTE> most
excellent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess. 3. 16.</NOTE> and most happy of Beings de∣lights
to be styled, and accordingly to
express himself, <HI>The God of love, mercy
and peace;</HI> and his blessed Son to be cal∣led,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 7.</NOTE>
and to be, <HI>the Prince of peace,</HI> the
great <HI>Mediatour, Reconciler,</HI> and <HI>Peace∣maker,</HI>
who is also said from on high to
<PB N="316" REF="162"/>
have visited us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 1. 79.</NOTE> <HI>To give light to them
that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of
death, and to guide our feet in the ways
of peace.</HI> That lastly no devotion is
pleasing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Orig. <HI>c.</HI> Cels. 8. <HI>(p. 424.)</HI></NOTE> no oblation acceptable to God,
conjoined with hatred, or proceeding
from an unreconciled mind: For, <HI>If
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
remembrest that thy brother hath ought
against thee; Leave there thy gift be∣fore
the altar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 23, 24.</NOTE> <HI>and go thy way; first be re∣conciled
to thy brother, and then come
and offer thy gift,</HI> saith our Saviour.</P>
<P>I close up all with this <HI>Corollary:</HI> that
if we must live lovingly, and peaceably
with all men, then much more are we
obliged to doe so with all Christians: to
whom by nearer and firmer bands of ho∣ly
alliance we are related; by more pre∣cious
communions in faith and devotion
we are endeared; by more peculiar and
powerfull obligations of divine com∣mands,
sacramental vows, and formal
professions we are engaged: Our spiri∣tual
brethren, members of the same my∣stical
body, temples of the same Holy
Spirit, servants of the same Lord, sub∣jects
of the same Prince, professors of the
same truth, partakers of the same hope,
heirs of the same promise, and candi∣dates
<PB N="317" REF="162"/>
of the same everlasting happiness.</P>
<P>Now Almighty God, the most good and
beneficent Maker, gracious Lord, and
mercifull preserver of all things, infuse
into our hearts those heavenly graces of
meekness, patience, and benignity, grant
us and his whole Church, and all his Crea∣tion
to serve him quietly here, and in a
blissfull rest to praise and magnify him for
ever: To whom with his blessed Son, the
great Mediatour and Prince of peace, and
with his Holy Spirit, the ever-flowing
Spring of all love, joy, comfort and peace,
be all honour, glory and praise. <HI>And</HI></P>
<P>The peace of God which passeth all un∣derstanding
keep your hearts and minds
in the knowledge and love of God, and of
his Son Jsesus Christ our Lord: And the
blessing of God Almighty, the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost be among you, and remain
with you for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
