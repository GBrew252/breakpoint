<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">U</SEG>Pon this following Letter of <HI>T. C.</HI> there
will need no other observation than
what Archbishop <HI>Bancroft</HI> long since
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Surv. of <HI>pretend. Discipl.</HI> c. 34. p. 447.</NOTE> in these words:</P>
<P>But it most of all pleaseth me to see, how
Master <HI>Cartwright</HI> draweth homeward. For as
the Anabaptists by their madness kept Master
<HI>Calvin</HI> within some good compass, and as
Master <HI>Beza</HI> hath been compelled in some sort,
to retire himself from his former eagerness: so
assuredly the phrenetical giddiness of these our
new unbrideled Schismaticks, who for preten∣ded
purity are many degrees beyond all the
<HI>Savoyan</HI> Disciplinarians, hath wrought a mira∣cle
(to my understanding) upon M. <HI>Cartwright.</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
For hear him, how for fear of falling into flat <HI>Do∣natism,</HI>
he was fain to plead against one (that had
been his Scholar) in the behalf of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Th. Cartw. <HI>to</HI> Harri∣sen.</NOTE> so bitterly before by himself im∣pugned.
<HI>The ordinary assemblies</HI> (saith he) <HI>of those
which profess the Gospel in</HI> England, <HI>are the Churches
of Christ:</HI> which he proveth in this sort; <HI>Those
Assemblies which have Christ for there head, and
the same also for their foundation, are Gods Churches:
Such are the assemblies of</HI> England, <HI>Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.
Again, <HI>They that have performed unto them the spe∣cial
Covenant which the Lord hath made with his
Churches, of pouring his spirit upon them, and putting
his word into their mouths, are the Churches of God:
But such are the assemblies in England, Therefore, &amp;c.
Hereunto may be added</HI> (saith he further) <HI>the judg∣ment
of all the Churches of Christ in</HI> Europe, <HI>all
which give the right hand of Society in the house of
God, unto the assemblies which are in</HI> England.
Again, to prove that the Church of <HI>England</HI> is
the Church of God, notwithstanding it want
the pretended Discipline; he useth this distin∣ction;
that <HI>at it is in mans body, so is it in this
<PB REF="3"/>
matter; there are certain-parts essential, and such
as without the which a man cannot stand, and some
serving either to his comelyness or to his continuance.</HI>
And of this latter sort he maketh the Disci∣pline.
And lastly, he write, thus; <HI>To say
that the Church of</HI> England <HI>is not the Church of
God, because it hath not received this Discipline,
methinks is all one with this, as if a man would say,
It is no City, because it hath no wall: or, that it
is no Vineyard, because it hath neither hedge nor
ditch.</HI> Thus far Master <HI>Cartwright.</HI></P>
<P>In which his manner of speech you find a
very great alteration, from his anoient stile.
And as concerning the necessity whereof I in∣treat,
the wind you see is turned. There is no
more necessity in <HI>England</HI> of the <HI>Geneva</HI> plat∣form,
than that every City in this Realm should
be walled about. And besides, the pretended
Discipline is become not to be any longer of
the essence of the Church, but as appertaining
to the comelyness of it.</P>
<P>And a little after,</P>
<P>And this I will add unto it, that if Master
<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>Cartwright</HI> would but confer with some that
haves kill in fortification, to know of him whe∣ther
an old thick wall of lime and stone, made
many hundred years since, or a new slight wall
slubbered over, and wrought with untempered
mortar some few years ago, whether (I say)
of these two walls are of better defense for any
City: I should be in good hope, that he would
in short time, leave the Disciplinary walls of
<HI>Geneva,</HI> and content himself with the ancient
fortifications of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and
the rather, because he seeth what a giddy and
itching humour his novelties have bred, in the
unstayed sort of many fantastical people.</P>
<P>Now to what <HI>M. Cartwright</HI> hath said in gene∣ral
to shew that there is no such necessity of Separa∣tion
from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as some of his
followers now pretend: may be added the Judgment
of a later Writer (concerning those particulars which
are so much scrupled by them, who under pretense of
greater purity will needs cast out all decency and good
order from the House of God:) in a Book, intituled
<HI>Five Disputations of Church Government and
Worship.</HI> Printed at London, 1659.</P>

<HEAD>A
LETTER of T. C.
TO
RICHARD HARRISON
CONCERNING
SEPARATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Grace and Peace, &amp;c.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>OR so much as I left you the
choice for the first conference,
whether you would have it in
writing, or by speech of mouth;
I attended some daies for An∣swer
of that matter: which, be∣cause
it was not returned, I e∣steemed
that you held you still
to the request of your Letters; which was, to receive
something from me by writing.</P>
<P>For Answer therefore; So it is, that your Letters
affected me diversly: for where your first page had
<PB N="12" REF="5"/>
raised me up unto some hope, of re-uniting your self
with the rest of your company unto us, from whom
you have thought good to sunder your selves; the
second page, which layeth forth the condition of our
peace, did cast me, and as were, beat me from it
again. Howbeit, the mercy of God upholding me
in some good hope of profiting you, or receiving
profit from you, I thought to cut out this time of
my weightiest and most necessary business, wherein
I might give that contentment, which the Lord hath
enabled mine hand unto.</P>
<P>Unto you, not unwilling to come to us, the pas∣sage
(as it seemeth) is stopped in divers respects:
The short whereof is; <HI>The receiving without publick
repentance, of those which come from the Churches of
England:</HI> where because in the outward profession,
that the Laws of the Land do justifie the dumb mi∣nistry,
there appear unto you no lawful assemblies
of the Church of Christ; your fear is, least in uniting
your selves with such, you should be <HI>unequally yoaked,</HI>
and made fellow members of some other than of that
whereof <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> is the Head.</P>
<P>First therefore, if it be shewed, that the ordinary
assemblies of those that profess the Gospel in <HI>England</HI>
be the <HI>Churches of Christ,</HI> it seemerh that the way will
be paved and planed for mutual entercourse between
us.</P>
<P>Thus therefore it seemeth to be performed.</P>
<P>Those Assemblies which have Christ for their Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Reason.</NOTE>
and the same also for their Foundation are <HI>Gods
Church.</HI></P>
<P>But such are the Assemblies of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Ergo, <HI>They are Gods Church.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
The Assumption is evident, in that, by believing
that <HI>Christ</HI> is our <HI>righteousness,</HI> we are members of his
body, and thereby are lively stones laid upon him
as upon a foundation, and grow into one spiritual
house with him. Now that they have like precious
faith with us, is convinced, not onely by their own
profession, but by the testimony of the Spirit of
God, who by manifold graces poured upon them,
doth bear them witness that they be members of the
body of Christ, who as the Head hath partaked un∣to
them his Holy Spirit, even to an apparent sanctifi∣cation
of numbers of them.</P>
<Q><P>They which have performed unto them the special Co∣venant<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Reason.</NOTE>
which the Lord hath made with his Chur∣ches,
by pouring his Spirit upon them, and his
word in their mouths, are the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>God.</HI></P></Q>
<P>But such are the Assemblies in <HI>England;</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, they are the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>As touching the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, it hath been said
before: Whereupon it also followeth, that he like∣wise
put his <HI>Word</HI> in their mouths, considering that
the Spirit of God is not given but by his Word.
And seeing that the Lord in mercy hath set up di∣vers
burning Lamps in those Assemblies, whereby
light is conveyed more or less into all the parts of
the Land; it seemeth that the Church of <HI>England</HI>
should receive injury if it should not be counted
among the <HI>Golden Candlesticks,</HI> which serve to keep
out darkness and night from the Lords House, until
such time as the day-spring, and <HI>Lucifer</HI> arise in our
hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
If you say, <HI>All do not believe the Gospel truly, which
profess;</HI> The same exception lyeth against all other
Churches, how reformed soever. If there be fewer
<HI>faithful</HI> in our Churches, than in others; The <HI>truth</HI> of
the Church standeth not in number: for it there
were in every Church <HI>one</HI> truly undissemblingly
faithful, all the rest holding the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ in <HI>words</HI> onely, yet should all those
Churches be to us the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> And if you
say, that <HI>all those Assemblies,</HI> as it were all the branches
and arms of the Candlestick, <HI>have not light set upon
them</HI> (the greater part of them being damped by a
<HI>dumb ministry</HI>) notwithstanding by the way you
confess, that <HI>those Assemblies upon whom the Lord hath
set up the lamp of a</HI> preaching Ministery, <HI>are the Chur∣ches
of God:</HI> which seemeth to cast down that hill
which standeth in the way against our rejoyning,
whereby you cannot afford us the name of <HI>Gods
Churches,</HI> because we have not the <HI>Discipline</HI> by him
appointed. Now for that other, whether they have
some glaunce of knowledge by that <HI>dumb Ministery</HI>
or not, may afterward in another place be conside∣red:
For the present, I answer, That even those
Congregations, for so much as they both have by
some former Ministery or means which the Lord hath
used towards them, received faith; standing thereby
in our <HI>Saviour Christ,</HI> as in the shaft of the Candle∣stick,
and being members of the same body, they
may well receive some supply of their wants, from
the light that shineth in the next branch unto them;
for if every Assembly being without a lamp of the
Ministery, should by and by be holden to be bro∣ken
from the shaft of the Church-Candlestick, then
at every vacation of the Ministery, and whensoever
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
by <HI>death</HI> the Lord should put out one of his lights,
it should follow, that that Assembly by the fall of
their Minister into the grave, should from the high∣est
heaven fall into the grave of Hell. But you will
say peradventure, that <HI>an Assembly that hath a</HI> dumb
Minister, <HI>is in worse case than that which bath none at
all:</HI> If that be granted, it followeth not therefore,
that the Assembly which yesterday, being without
a dumb Minister, was the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> should to
day, having such a one set over them, be the <HI>Syna∣gogue</HI>
of <HI>Satan.</HI> And here, methink, when you go
about to make nothing of the <HI>dumb Ministery,</HI> you
ascribe more force unto it than it hath: for you make
him not so much a <HI>guide,</HI> as an <HI>Head</HI> of the Church,
as that those which before in all equal judgment
were to be deemed members of Christ, by having
of them should suddenly become members of <HI>Anti∣christ.</HI>
I do not therefore yield unto you in that
you say, <HI>they are the chief alway in the Synagogue;</HI> our
<HI>Saviour Christ,</HI> in whom those companies do believe,
being the chief; with whom through faith they
grow to be one body, rather than with Satan by
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">having.</NOTE> hearing the dumb Minister, to be one with him.
Say therefore, that it is a fault in them to hear such
a Minister, thrust upon them; yet that it is an <HI>Apo∣stacy</HI>
from God, and an utter falling away from the
<HI>Gospel,</HI> I se not with what great appearance of truth
it can be spoken. <HI>Moses,</HI> when divers of the people
clave unto <HI>Coreh, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> forsaking wil∣lingly
the lawful and ordinary Ministery of the <HI>Aaro∣nites,</HI>
did not therefore cast them forth from the
Lords host: And should the Churches of God, for
hearing a <HI>dumb Minister,</HI> which is thrust upon them,
forthwith be reputed for runagates from the Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Again:</P>
<P><Q><HI>The Lord is in Covenant with the people,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Reason.</NOTE> <HI>to whom he
gives the</HI> Seals <HI>of his Covenant.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This he doth to our Assemblies in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, they are the Lords Confederates.</P>
<P>If you say, that <HI>the</HI> Seals <HI>set to by the dumb Ministery
are no Seals,</HI> (which afterward cometh to be exami∣ned)
yet you thereby confess, that <HI>those which are
ministered by sufficient Ministers, are</HI> true <HI>and</HI> un∣counterfeit
<HI>Sacraments of the Church:</HI> whereby it
falleth out again, that you seem to hold, that <HI>the
Churches of</HI> England <HI>are not the true Churches of Christ,
because they have not his commanded</HI> Discipline.
Hereto may be added all the Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI>
all which give the right hand of Society in the
house of God unto the Assemblies which are in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
Which argument of Churches <HI>Authority,</HI> al∣though
it be not so strong as it will enforce, yet
ought it to stay all sudden judgment unto the con∣trary:
and so long to cause silence, until the Cause
being ripely on both sides debated, the contrary of
it which the Churches should do, through the light∣somness
of the truth thereof break forth. And if
it be meet to proceed softly, and as it were with a
leaden foot, unto the Excommunication of one
onely member of the Church of God; there ought
verily to have been great consultation taken, or
ever the Churches of two whole Islands should have
been cast out: especially, when they be holden in by
Voices, not onely of divers persons, but of all the
Churches to whom knowledge of their estate hath
come. And if there were but one man worthy to
be Excommunicate, yet if the greater part of your
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Assembly would not yield consent thereunto, I hold
it, that the <HI>order</HI> of the Discipliae requireth that
the rest are to bear the person whom they cannot
remove: And therefore, though the Assemblies of
<HI>England</HI> had deserved, through want of <HI>Discipline,</HI>
and of a <HI>preaching Ministery,</HI> to be cast out from the
accompt of the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> yet being holden
in by the <HI>Voices</HI> of the Churches themselves, ought
to have been so far born with, as the <HI>communicating</HI>
should not make them guilty of a <HI>falling away from
the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now I come to those two Reasons whereby you
think you may justly hold the Assemblies in <HI>England</HI>
for no Churches of God: And first of all to the
reason of the <HI>Discipline,</HI> for the want whereof you
gave them all without exception the black stone of
<HI>condemnation</HI> from being the Churches of God:
Where it is to be understood, that as in a <HI>Man</HI> there
are certain parts essential, and such as without which
the man cannot stand; and other some serving to his
comelyness, or to his long continuance: So it is in
this matter; there is the foundation, <HI>CHRIST,</HI>
whereupon it is necessary that by <HI>faith</HI> the Assem∣blies
be laid, which groweth unto the <HI>Lords</HI> build∣ing,
without the which it cannot be his <HI>Church;</HI>
which thing being, whatsoever is wanting of that
which is <HI>commanded,</HI> or remaining of that which
is <HI>forbidden,</HI> is not able to put that Assembly, which
by <HI>faith</HI> is laid upon <HI>Christ,</HI> from the right and title
of being the <HI>Church of Christ:</HI> for <HI>Faith</HI> can admit
no such thing, which giveth an utter overthrow and
turning upside down of the truth. By this title of
the <HI>Faithful,</HI> the <HI>Apostle</HI> in his Epistles noteth out the
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Churches of God, it being all one with him to say,
<HI>To the Faithful,</HI> or <HI>To the Saints,</HI> as <HI>To the Church</HI>
of such a place. Whatsoever wanteth unto this, or
is more than enough, that wanteth or aboundeth to
the disgrace or uncomelyness, or to the hazard of
continuance, and not to the present overthrow of
the Church. Hereupon the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> which
neglected for the space of forty years the holy Sa∣crament
of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and the <HI>Passeover</HI> also as it
seemeth (one onely time excepted) ceased not there∣fore
to be the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and to have the
Sanctuary among them. And in this respect the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Assemblies, whereof the greatest part in High
<HI>Germany</HI> (which, beside the main of Discipline,
which is common to our Churches, are groslly de∣ceived
in the matter of the <HI>Supper</HI>) are notwith∣standing
holden in the Roul of the <HI>Churches of God.</HI>
In this respect also, certain Assemblies of our Pro∣fession,
which having the use of the <HI>Discipline</HI> per∣mitted
unto them, are not suffered to have the use
of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> are not therefore (when the
<HI>Lords Churches</HI> are mustered, and their names writ∣ten
and enrouled up) cast out as <HI>unfit</HI> to be in any
accompt of the <HI>Lords hosts.</HI> Without any part of
that <HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Discipline</HI> which the Lord hath appoin∣ted,
I grant there can be no <HI>Church of Christ;</HI> or,
that without some part of it, there can be no <HI>faith</HI>
in Jesus Christ: It is a part of the Discipline of our
Saviour Christ, that there should be certain which
should be chosen out of the rest to <HI>preach the Gospel,</HI>
by preaching whereof the <HI>Churches</HI> are gathered
together: Where therefore there is no <HI>Ministery</HI>
of the Word, there it is plain, that there are no
<HI>visible</HI> and <HI>apparent Churches.</HI> It is another piece of
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the Lord, that the rest of the body
of the Church should <HI>obey</HI> those that are set over
them in the Lord: wheresoever therefore there is no
<HI>obedience</HI> of the people to the Ministers, that in the
<HI>Lords</HI> name preach unto them, there can be no <HI>true
Church</HI> of Christ. But where these two be, although
other points want, yea although there be some de∣fect
in these, that neither the <HI>Ministers</HI> do in all
points preach as they ought, nor the <HI>Assemblies</HI> in all
points obey unto the wholesome doctrine of their
Teachers; yet do they (for the reason above-said)
retein the <HI>right</HI> of the Churches of God. This is
made plain by a similitude from the <HI>body</HI> of a man,
whereinto we are already entred: For if a man
should have both his hands and his arms cut off, his
eyes put out, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet as long as the head standeth,
and other vital parts, he is to be accompted a Man,
although a maimed man: Even so it is in the Assem∣bly;
as long as it holdeth the <HI>head,</HI> how defective
soever it is otherwise, it hath the due and right of
the <HI>Church of God.</HI> And although a man should
have six fingers in one hand, and but three in ano∣ther,
and albeit they should stand where the mouth
doth; yet all this deformity should not hinder him
from being truely holden to be a Man, although it
should be a great deformity in him. On the other
part, if he had no Head at all, or that there were
no natural conjunction of the parts one with ano∣ther,
but a whole and through displacing of every
part from his proper seat; then verily would he be
denyed to have either the proportion of a Man,
or his life. So likewise if an Assembly should not
hold the Head, which is <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> or be nothing
elss but a confused multitude, without part of the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<HI>order</HI> which the Son of God hath appointed, the
same is justly crossed out of the accompt of <HI>Gods
Church.</HI> Was not <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> after the return from
<HI>Babylon,</HI> the City of the great King, until such time
as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> came and builded the Walls of the
City? To say therefore, <HI>it is none of the Church
of God, because it hath not received the Discipline,</HI>
metthinks it is all one with this, as if a man should say,
<HI>It is no City because it hath no Wall,</HI> or <HI>that it is no
Vineyard because it hath neither ditch nor hedge.</HI> It is
not, I grant, so sightly a City, or Vineyard, nor
yet so safe against the invasion of their several ene∣mies
which lye in wait for them; yet are they truely
both <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Vineyards.</HI></P>
<P>There remaineth that other point, which is a∣gainst
those Assemblies onely which have a <HI>dumb
Minister:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of Assem∣blies
of</HI> dumb Mi∣nisters.</NOTE> wherein the part of your conclusion,
<HI>That that Assembly where they be, is none of the Church
of God,</HI> is before answered. Therein resteth that
part of your conclusion, whereby you infer, <HI>That
the Sacraments ministred by them are none of Gods
Sacraments,</HI> and therefore <HI>that a man may not re∣ceive
any part of them at their hands.</HI> Here first I
agree with you, that their Ministery is <HI>unlawful,</HI> and
to themselves, without repentance, a certain matter
of destruction; especially in those to whom know∣ledge
of corruption is come: to the Churches where
they be, presently hurtful, and in the end without
remedy, deadly: But that they are no <HI>Ministers of
God,</HI> so far as to receive the <HI>good</HI> they offer unto us,
that (I suppose) I may not yield unto: The
ground whereof I take from the former part of my
Answer; <HI>That for so much as they are allowed by the
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
Churches of God, they ought, until remedy may be
found of so great disorder, to be heard and retained so
far as they can give us any thing that is of Christ:</HI> And
for this cause our Saviour commanded, that the
<HI>Scribes</HI> should be heard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 23. 2.</NOTE> for that they taught <HI>truely;</HI>
which honour our Saviour would never have given
unto them, unless the Church-calling had moved
him thereunto: Neither had it been lawful for the
people otherwise to have heard them; for it is evi∣dent
that their unfitness and unlawfulness in the Mi∣nistery
(although another way) was as great as it
is in our <HI>reading Ministers.</HI> They were altogether
deceived in the <HI>Messias;</HI> for neither knew they that
<HI>Jesus was Christ;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 9. 22.</NOTE> nor yet that <HI>Christ,</HI> whom they
looked for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 22. 42.</NOTE> should be <HI>the Son of God,</HI> but held him
for a bare and naked man. It appeareth also that
they taught the Justification by the <HI>Law of Works,</HI>
not onely in the 18. of <HI>Luke,</HI> but even in the same
very place, where our Saviour Christ commandeth
this audience: for speaking of the works of the
<HI>moral Law,</HI> which they would not touch with <HI>one
of</HI> their <HI>fingers,</HI> he saith, that they <HI>laid them upon the
peoples backs as burthens which cannot be born:</HI> where∣by
our Saviour (beside their Pharisaical pride and
lordlyness in teaching) signifieth that they taught
them to <HI>Justification;</HI> seeing that if they had onely
taught them as testimonies and fruits or <HI>faith,</HI> they
had not been intolerable, bur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 11.</NOTE> as our Saviour Christ
saith, an <HI>easie yoke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 5.</NOTE> and as S. <HI>John</HI> saith, not <HI>grievous</HI> nor
<HI>heavy.</HI> Now the <HI>dumb Ministery</HI> is not farther off
from the justification of a <HI>lawful Ministery,</HI> than to
teach <HI>untruely</HI> in the chief grounds, of Religion;
neither is the edifying of the Church respected
in making Laws for the Ministery, less hindred
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
by an <HI>unpreaching Ministery.</HI> And according to this
saying of our Saviour Christ, we may see what the
practice of the <HI>Prophets</HI> had been before; who al∣though
they had oftentimes to do with <HI>false teachers</HI>
and <HI>Priests</HI> that were <HI>dumb dogs</HI> and <HI>not able to bark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 56.</NOTE>
yet (giving the people warning of their corrupti∣ons
and insufficiencies, threatning also the casting of
them from their Ministery, in that good time when
the Lord shall take <HI>pity on his Church</HI>) they are never
found to have forbidden the people to have come
unto their sacrifices commanded by the Law unto
them. Yea our Saviour Christ that lived in the corrup∣test
times of the Church, and when things were most
confused, and fewest steps of any lawful Calling to
be seen, yet commanded he the man whom he purged
from <HI>Leprosie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 8.</NOTE> to <HI>shew</HI> himself <HI>to the Priests</HI> generally,
without willing him to make choice of a Priest bet∣ter
instructed or affected to the truth than the rest.
The <HI>high Priest,</HI> although he entred by Simony and
reward to the <HI>Romans,</HI> yet notwihstanding we see
our Saviour Christ bore him reverence for his office
sake, and (as before his Judge in <HI>Spiritual Causes</HI>)
gave an accompt of his doctrine. We have another
example of reverence given to such Rulers, even in
things that were done by them wrongfully. For <HI>Je∣remy</HI>
being for a time suspended from coming into
the <HI>Temple,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 36. 19.</NOTE> being at liberty would not (least, as it
seemeth, he should make a tumult) enter the Tem∣ple;
and therefore (having written that which he
had to say) sent <HI>Baruch to read</HI> his Sermon <HI>in the
Temple.</HI> Moreover, when a Magistrate is not able
to do some part of his office, as for example, being
able to do the duties which are to be performed in
peace, is insufficient for Martial affaire, yet no man
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
refuseth that which he is able to give, because he is
not able to do all that is required: Even so, endea∣vouring
to our uttermost a <HI>sufficient Ministery,</HI> I
would think in the mean season, that the <HI>good things</HI>
they are able to give us, may be taken at their hands.
And if any man say, <HI>that it is of the substance of a,</HI>
Church-Minister, <HI>to be able to teach;</HI> and therefore
<HI>that he is no Minister, that hath not that ability:</HI> It
may be answered, <HI>that it is of the substance of a good
and lawful Minister of God, but not simply of a Minister;
whereunto it is sufficient to have the Churches calling:</HI>
As it is of the substance, rather of a lawful Magistrate,
to be able to judge between his Subjects, than simply
of a Magistrate, whom the election of the people,
or of other to whom his choice belongeth, maketh
a Magistrate of the Lord, although he be no lawful
nor sufficient Magistrate. As therefore we call him
a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> who for the ignorance of his charge
may be called an <HI>Idol Magistrate;</HI> even so it seemeth
that he may be holden for a Minister, which hath
his Churches Calling, although he be not able to
do the principal charge of the <HI>Ministery.</HI> Neither
doth the place of the Prophet <HI>Hosee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 4. 6.</NOTE> which saith,
<HI>because</HI> they have <HI>refused knowledge,</HI> they shall <HI>be no
Priests unto</HI> the Lord, stand against this: the Pro∣phet
rather giving a <HI>rule</HI> to follow in the election or
disposition of them, shewing how far they may be
used.</P>
<P>Finally, to that which is objected of <HI>communi∣cating
with their impiety, in any taking any thing at
their hands:</HI> I Answer, the same might have been
laid to the peoples charge under the <HI>Law;</HI> which is
never done by the Prophets. Secondly, if by com∣municating
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
with him, we should make him Minister,
I grant that a piece of his guilt would stick to our
fingers: but when that is not, I see not how, by
receiving the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of him, we partake more
of his wickedness, than the Son is partaker of his
Fathers murther, because he receiveth of his Fa∣thers
gift some part of his lands or moveables: And
so much the less there than here, as the Father giveth
his own things, whereas the <HI>dumb Minister</HI> doth
onely <HI>dispense</HI> the gifts of the Lord. Wherefore it
may be rather feared, lest in <HI>refusing</HI> the Sacraments
offered by him, we put the Lord away from us,
whose they be; than in taking of the Sacraments
at his hands, be partakers of <HI>impiety,</HI> which is the
mans, and can take no hold of the Sacraments in
any sort. For even as I, not able to avoid him,
may communicate with a Minister, that is an <HI>Adul∣terer,</HI>
without being partaker of his Adultery; so
also may I communicate with a <HI>dumb Minister</HI> and
yet nevertheless be free from his <HI>impiety.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you have mine Answer, written not with∣out
the fear and trembling your selves make mention
of; whereby it will not be hard for you to under∣stand,
how both our desires of being united toge∣ther
may be performed: And although I write in
good assurance, especially in the former part as
touching <HI>the rightful title of the Churches of Christ
to be due to the Assemblies of</HI> England; yet remem∣bring
(beside the common frailties of our whole
race) special breaches and decaies in my self, I
willingly hearken to any, much more to you (whom
the Lord hath bestowed good graces upon) shewing
better things: for which cause if further conference
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
be needful, I must through business be forced to
refer to conference by mouth some time after
diner.</P>
<P>And thus with most humble prayers to the Lord
our God for his <HI>Holy Spirit, where-through we may be
able to discern the things that differ, to our inoffensive
walking in the sight of all men, even to the day of the
Lord,</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE
JUDGMENT
OF
Mr. Baxter
CONCERNING
CEREMONIES
AND
CONFORMITY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hose Modes or Circumstances of
Worship which are Necessary <HI>in
Genere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disp. 4. P. 361.</NOTE> but left undetermined by
God <HI>in Specie,</HI> are left by God to
humane Prudential Determination:
(else an Impossibility should be ne∣cessary.)
But many such there are,
that are Necessary <HI>in Genere,</HI> but left undetermined
of God <HI>in Specie;</HI> therefore many such are left to
humane Prudential Determination.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="13"/>
§. 5.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disp. 5. P. 400.</NOTE> Yet it is in the power of a man to determine
of such Modes and Circumstances as are necessary
to the performance of that Worship which God hath
instituted in his Word; and therefore lawful Gover∣nors
may in such cases bind us by their Commands.</P>
<P>1. It is left to humane Determination,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> what <HI>Place</HI> the Publick Assemblies shall be held in.</P>
<P>2. It is left to man to determine of the <HI>Time</HI> of
Holy Duties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 401.</NOTE> except only where God hath deter∣mined
of it already.</P>
<P>3. It is left to the Determination of humane Pru∣dence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>
what <HI>Vtensils</HI> to employ about the Publick
Worship of God.</P>
<P>Here therefore we must thus conclude,</P>
<P>1. That every misordering of such great affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 423.</NOTE> is
the sin of them that do it.</P>
<P>2. But yet that the Subject is not exempted from
Obedience by every such mistake of the Governor:
but by some he is.</P>
<P>§. 67. If the mischoosing of such Circumstances,
by Church Governors, be but an Inconvenience, and
do not destroy the Ordinance it self, or frustrate the
Ends of it, we are to obey: 1. For he is the Judge
of his own work, and not we: 2. The thing is not
sinful, though inconvenient: 3. Obedience is com∣manded
to our lawful Governors.</P>
<Q>We must obey in all things lawful.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 424.</NOTE></Q>
<P>And when we do obey in a Case of Miscommand∣ing,
it is not a doing evil, that good may come of it,
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
as some do misconceive: but it is only a submitting
to that which is ill commanded, but not evil in him
that doth submit. It is the Determiner that is the
cause of the Inconvenience, and not the Obeyer.
Nor is it inconvenient for me to Obey, though it be
worse perhaps to him that Commandeth. While he
sinneth in Commanding, he may make it my Duty to
Obey.</P>
<P>§. 6. <HI>Dist.</HI> 4. We must distinguish between Cere∣monies
imposed by a <HI>Lawful Magistrate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 396.</NOTE> or <HI>Church-Governors;</HI>
and such as are imposed by <HI>Vsurpers,</HI> or
Men without Authority.</P>
<P>§. 25. <HI>Prop.</HI> 12. It may be very sinful to command some
Ceremonies, which may lawfully,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 398.</NOTE> yea, must in Duty be
used by the Subject when they are commanded.</P>
<P>§. 27. <HI>Prop.</HI> 14. Yet certain things that are commonly
called Ceremonies, may lawfully be used in the Church
upon Humane Imposition; and when it is not against the
Law of God, no person should disobey the Commands of
their Lawful Governors in such things.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Set-Forms, and the Book of

<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. A Stinted Liturgy is in it self Lawful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Stinted Liturgy in some parts of Publick
Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disp. 4. P. 358.</NOTE> is ordinarily necessary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In the parts where it is not of Necessity, it
may not onely be submitted to, but desired,
when the Peace of the Church requireth
it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="20" REF="14"/>
7. The safest way of Composing such a Publick
Form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 359.</NOTE> is, to take it all, for Matter and Words,
out of the Holy Scriptures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Yet is not this of such Necessity, but that we
may joyn in it, or use it, if the Form of Words
be not from Scripture.</ITEM>
</LIST>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Prop. 1. A Stinted Liturgy is in it
self Lawful</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">This is thus proved: </HEAD>
<P><HI>Argument 1.</HI> That which is not directly, or conse∣quentially
forbidden by God, remaineth lawful: A stinted
Liturgy is not directly, or consequentially forbidden by
God; therefore it remaineth lawful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Major</HI> is undoubted's because nothing but a
Prohibition can make a thing unlawful. <HI>Sin is a
transgression of a Law: where there is no Law, there
is no Trangression:</HI> And yet I have heard very Re∣verend
men answer this, <HI>That it is enough that it is
not commanded, though not forbidden.</HI> Which is plain∣ly
to deny both Scripture and Civil Principles.</P>
<P>Now for the <HI>Minor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 361.</NOTE> <HI>That a stinted Liturgy is not
forbidden,</HI> we need no other proof, than that no Pro∣hibition can be produced.</P>
<P>Argument 6. <HI>If it be lawful for the People to use a
stinted Form of Words in Publick Prayer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 364.</NOTE> <HI>then is it in
it self lawful for the Pastors: but it is lawful for the
People:</HI> for the Pastors prayer (which they must pray
over with him, and not onely hear it) is a stinted
Form to them, even as much as if he had learnt it out
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>
of a Book. They are to follow him in his Method
and Words, as if it were a Book-Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Argument 7.</HI> It is lawful to use a Form in Preaching:
therefore a stinted Liturgy is lawful.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Because Preaching is a part of that Liturgy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Because the reason is the same for Prayer, as
for that, in the main.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Argument 8. <HI>That which hath been the practice of the
Church in Scripture-times, and down to this day, and is
yet the practice of almost all the Churches of Christ on
earth, is not like to be unlawful: but such is the use of
some stinted forms of Publick Service: therefore, &amp;c.</HI>
That it was so in the <HI>Jews</HI> Church, and approved by
Christ, I have shewed. That it hath been of ancient
use in the Church since Christ, and is at this day in use
in <HI>Africk, Asia, Europe,</HI> even among the Reformed
Churches in <HI>France, Holland, Geneva,</HI> &amp;c. is so well
known, that I think I need not stand to prove it:
yea, those few that seem to disuse it, do yet use it, in
<HI>Psalms,</HI> and other parts of Worship.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> it self, I never rejected it
because it was a Form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 421.</NOTE> nor thought it simply unlawful
because it was such a Form; but have made use of it,
and would do again in the like case.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="22" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>Of Ceremonies.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Ceremonies controverted among us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 409.</NOTE> <HI>were
especially,</HI> The Surplice, the Gesture of Kneeling in re∣ceiving
the Lords Supper, the Ring in Marriage, Laying
the hand on the Book in taking an Oath, the <HI>Organs and
Church-Musick, Holy-dayes, Altars, Rails,</HI> and the <HI>Cross
in Baptisme.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of the Surplice.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Some decent Habit</HI> is necessary; either the Magi∣strate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 409.</NOTE>
or the Minister himfelf, or the Associatcd Pa∣stors
must determine what. I think neither Magi∣strate
nor Synod should do any more than hinder
Undecency: But yet if they <HI>do</HI> more, and tye all
to <HI>One Habit</HI> (add suppose it were an undecent Habit)
yet this is but an <HI>imprudent use of Power.</HI> It is a thing
within the Magistrates reach; he doth not an <HI>aliene</HI>
work, but his own work amiss: and therefore the
thing <HI>in it self</HI> being <HI>lawful; I would obey him,</HI> and use
that garment, if I could not be dispensed with. Yea,
though <HI>Secondarily</HI> the <HI>Whiteness</HI> be to signifie Purity,
and so it be made a teaching sign, yet would I obey.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Kneeling at the Sacrament.</HEAD>
<P>But yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 411.</NOTE> as sinfully as this Gesture was imposed, for
my part I did obey the Imposers, and would do, if it
were to do again, rather than disturb the Peace of the
Church, or be deprived of its Communion. For God
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>
having made <HI>some Gesture</HI> necessary, and confined me
to none, but left it to Humane Determination, I shall
submit to Magistrates in their proper work, even
when they miss it in the manner. I am not sure that
Christ intended the example of himself and his A∣postles,
as obligatory to us that shall succeed. I am
sure it proves <HI>sitting lawful;</HI> but I am not sure that
it proves it <HI>necessary:</HI> (though <HI>very convenient.</HI>) But
I am <HI>sure,</HI> he hath <HI>commanded me Obedience and Peace.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of the Ring in Marriage.</HEAD>
<P>And for the <HI>Ring in Marriage,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 411.</NOTE> I see no reason to
scruple the lawfulness of it: For though the Papists
make a <HI>Sacrament</HI> of <HI>Marriage,</HI> yet we have no reason
to take it for any Ordinance of Divine Worship; any
more than the solemnizing of a Contract between a
Prince and People. All things are sanctified and pure
to the pure.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Organs and Church Musick.</HEAD>
<P>And for <HI>Organs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 412.</NOTE> or other <HI>Instruments of Musick</HI> in
Gods Worship, they being a Help partly <HI>Natural,</HI> and
partly <HI>Artificial,</HI> to the exhilerating of the spirits, for
the praise of God, I know no argument to prove
them simply unlawful, but what would prove a <HI>Cup
of Wine</HI> unlawful, or the <HI>tune</HI> and <HI>meeter,</HI> and <HI>melody</HI>
of singing unlawful.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>Of Holy-Dayes.</HEAD>
<P>Nor for my part do I make any scruple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In point of Lawfulness; For Conve∣niency is ac∣cording to se∣veral acci∣dents.</NOTE> to keep a
Day in Remembrance of any Eminent Servant of
Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 412, 413.</NOTE> or Martyr, to praise God for their Doctrine or
Example, and honour their Memorial.</P>
<P>But the hardest part of the Question is, <HI>Whether it
be lawful to keep Dayes, in celebrating the Memorial of
Christs Nativity, Circumcision, Fasting; Transfiguration,
Ascension, and such like?</HI></P>
<P>And yet for all this I am resolved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 416.</NOTE> if I live where
such Holy-days as these are observed, to censure no
man for observing them; nor would I deny them Li∣berty
to follow their judgments, if I had the power
of their Liberties; provided they use not reproach
and violence to others; and seek not to deprive them
of their Liberties.</P>
<P>Yea more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 417.</NOTE> I would not onely give men their Li∣berty
in this, but if I lived under a Government that
peremptorily commanded it, I would observe the
outward rest of such a Holy-day, and I would preach
on it, and joyn with the Assemblies in Gods Worship
on it. Yea, I would thus observe the Day, rather than
offend a weak Brother, or hinder any mans salvation,
much more rather than I would make any division in
the Church.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Altars, and Rails.</HEAD>
<P>And for the next Ceremony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> the <HI>Name and form of
an Altar;</HI> no doubt it is a thing indifferent, whether
the Table stand this way, or that way: and the Pri∣mitive
Churches used commonly the names of <HI>Sacri∣fice,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>
and <HI>Altar,</HI> and <HI>Priest,</HI> and I think, lawfully: for
my part I shall not be he that shall condemn them.</P>
<P>I conceive that the dislike of these things in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
(the form and name of an Altar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 417.</NOTE> and the Rails
about it) was not as if they were simply evil.</P>
<P>Whether we shall receive the Lords Supper at a
Table,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 401, 402.</NOTE> or in our Seats; and whether the Table shall
be of wood or stone? whether it shall be round, or
long, or square? whether it shall stand in the East or
West-end of the Temple, or in the middle? whether
it shall have Rails, or no Rails? All these are lest to
Humane Prudence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of the Cross in Baptism.</HEAD>
<P>But of all our Ceremonies, there is none that I
have more suspected to be <HI>simply unlawful,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 417.</NOTE> <HI>than the
Cross in Baptism.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I dare not <HI>peremptorily say, that it is unlawful:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 418.</NOTE>
nor will I <HI>condemn either Ancients or Moderns that
use it:</HI> nor will I <HI>make any disturbance in the Church
about it,</HI> more than my own forbearance will make.</P>
<P>I presume not to censure them that judge it lawful;
but onely give the Reasons that make me doubt, and
rather think it to be unlawful, though still with a sus∣picion
of my own understanding.</P>
