<HEAD>To his Reverend Brethren, the Godly, Or∣thodox Pastors and Preach∣ers of <HI>Gods</HI> Word, in and about the City of <HI>London</HI>: the Author of this brief discovery and confutation, wisheth all increase of Grace, peace and happinesse; with the abundance of blessings from <HI>God</HI> on their faithfull labours.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Reverend, and dearely beloved Brethren, it is not unknown to divers of you, what great conflicts I have had with the ad∣versaries of this <HI>Socinian</HI> Facti∣on about this main fundamentall point of <HI>Justification,</HI> what pains I have taken to vindicate the truth
<PB REF="3"/>
above six and twenty yeares agoe, from the opposition and subtile Sophistry of a cunning adversary, who by the fame and opinion which men had of his great Learn∣ing, and no lesse Piety, had drawn many zealous Professors of Reli∣gion into some liking of his Er∣rours. His written Pamphlets went currently through the City and were to be found in the hands of many men, in which he First utterly renounced the Law, in whole and part performed by our selves, or any other in our stead, for the <HI>justifying</HI> of us in the sight of <HI>God.</HI> Secondly, rejected as a meere device of our late Di∣vines, the <HI>imputation</HI> of <HI>Christs righteousnesse</HI> and <HI>satisfaction,</HI> not onely his <HI>habituall righte∣ousnesse,</HI> but also his whole <HI>obe∣dience,</HI> both <HI>active</HI> and <HI>passive;</HI> and affirmed it to be a thing wher∣of
<PB REF="3"/>
there was no testimony or proof in Scripture, nor any necessary end or use thereof. Thirdly, he professed and undertook to prove, thot <HI>Faith,</HI> even the <HI>act</HI> of <HI>belee∣ving</HI> and <HI>trusting</HI> in <HI>Christ</HI> for <HI>salvation</HI> after a generall and confused manner, as a favourite of <HI>God,</HI> and not as a perfect satis∣fyer of his <HI>justice</HI> and just Law; is that which <HI>God</HI> accounts and accepts for <HI>righteousnesse</HI> to <HI>justification,</HI> in stead of <HI>righte∣ousnesse</HI> and perfect <HI>obedience</HI> performed to the will and Law of <HI>God,</HI> either by <HI>Christ</HI> or our selves. These and divers other errors which were here and there interlaced, I did at the first dis∣cover in some sermons, to be no Doctrines of sacred Truth by him digged out of the deep mines of holy Scripture▪ and newly brought to light (as his seduced Disciples
<PB REF="4"/>
proclaymed them to be) for the inlightning of the blind world in these last dayes of darknesse and perillous times: but the old errors and Heresies of <HI>Servetus</HI> and <HI>Socinus,</HI> newly revived and ra∣ked out of hell by <HI>Arminius, Ber∣tius,</HI> and others of their Faction. Divers of his Friends who had begun to imbrace his opinion, were not a little terrified at the hear∣ing of these things; and earnestly besought me to give him a meet∣ing, who at that time was to me unknown by face; I condescended to their desire: but wheras I came with an heart full of tender com∣passion, and with Prayers in my mouth, and teares in mine eyes, layd open before him the danger of his errors, and the evill and mis∣chiefe which by meanes of his ob∣stinate persisting in them, might accrue to himselfe and those who
<PB REF="4"/>
were by him seduced and misled; he on the contrary hardened his heart to maintain <HI>per fas, et ne∣fas,</HI> and <HI>dolo malo</HI> his foresaid erroneous opinions; shewing out of <HI>Luther</HI> on the <HI>Galatians,</HI> some words which seemed to favour his error, and to exclude the <HI>righte∣ousnesse</HI> of the Law from <HI>justifi∣cation</HI> (which words he applyed to the <HI>righteousnesse</HI> of the Law performed by <HI>Christ</HI> for us, and did most stiffly so urge them:) but the words which immediately fol∣lowed, to wit, that <HI>God justifies us by the righteousnesse of his Son</HI> Jesus Christ, and by his <HI>ful∣filling of the Law for us,</HI> he covered with his fingers, till I pluckt the Book out of his hands, and read them to those that were present, whereby he was much con∣founded. Now the issue of my fair and Christian dealing with him
<PB REF="5"/>
and of my modest and mild oppo∣sing of him, without such sharp∣nesse as the cause and his carriage did require, was the same, which the gentle behaviour of Ortho∣dox Divines towards perverse Hereticks, hath commonly had in all former ages: For his Factious disciples did impute it to the weak∣nesse of my Cause, and to his ar∣guments convincing my Consci∣ence, that his opinions were not so dangerous as I had censured them to be: but rather unreprovable, yea and laudable. And upon my departure out of the City, imme∣diately after to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> whi∣ther my occasions called me; in my absence they reported, that at our meeting he did so convince and confound me with strong argu∣ments, that I humbled my selfe, to him confessed my ignorance, im∣braced his opinions, and promised
<PB REF="5"/>
to hold and maintaine them till death. This wicked and Jesuiti∣call policy which they used to re∣taine divers of his disciples, who wer ready to fall off from him; &amp; to recall those who were fallen off already, did produce a quite con∣trary effect: For when I returned again to the City, and was saluted as a Socinian onvert, and infor∣med of their false reports &amp; lying forgeries; I was inflamed with a double desire to vindicate both the truth of <HI>God,</HI> and mine own repu∣tation from their slanderous as∣persions; and hereupon I betook my selfe to handle and expound that place of Scripture, <HI>Rom. 5.17, 18, 19.</HI> which doth most pithily and plainly set forth the Doctrine of <HI>Justification</HI> by the communi∣on of <HI>Christs righteousnes</HI> and <HI>obedience.</HI> And because I dis∣cerned in mine <HI>Adversaries</HI> a
<PB REF="6"/>
perverse Hereticall spirit, and that they had made lyes their re∣fuge, and did sinne being condem∣ned of themselves; I did with all zeale confute their errours, lay open the deadly poyson and malig∣nity of them, and cloath them with such reproachfull titles as divers grave and learned Divines of the best reformed Churches had before shaped and fitted to them. I proved them to be profane and abominable Doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epistolica Collatio cum Ber∣tio, pag 1. &amp; 2.</HI></NOTE> even the damned Heresie of <HI>Servetus</HI> and <HI>Socinus,</HI> as <HI>Sibrandus Luber∣tus</HI> had before stiled them. And that their denying of the recipro∣call imputation of <HI>Christs righ∣teousnesse</HI> and satisfaction to the faithfull, and of their sinnes to <HI>Christ,</HI> was impiety and blasphe∣my, as learned <HI>Beza</HI> calls it. Though by this meanes my adver∣saries were enraged,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib. con. Anony∣mum.</HI></NOTE> and did sug∣gest
<PB REF="6"/>
into the eares and minds of many godly people in the City, to whom as yet I was unknown, that I was a green headed novice car∣ryed away with anger and passion, rather then <HI>zeal:</HI> yet divers of you, my learned Brethren, did judge otherwise of me, and my labours; and <HI>God</HI> blessed them, and made them and your assistance of me therein, powerfull and effectuall to the quelling of those errors, and to the suppressing of them at that time, by putting the Author of them to silence. And now for <HI>20.</HI> yeares, and more, they have been buryed in oblivion, untill this new Adversary hath raked them up, as coales out of ashes, and out of a surreptitious Booke (which the First Adversary had composed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wotton de Recon∣ciliatione.</HI></NOTE> Printed beyond the Seas, and pro∣cured to be brought in by stealth, and sold underhand) did bring
<PB REF="7"/>
them into the pulpit, and from thence with a tumultuous noyse proclaymed them most confidently. Now because I have sufficiently acted my part heretofore in oppo∣sing these errors; and also divers of you have entered into the lists, and with zeale and courage have begun to fight against the reviver of them, I should have refrayned my selfe from further medling: but because this common adver∣sary hath singled me out, and pro∣voked me by a proud challenge, to answere his writings. I have once more undertaken to answer his challenge, which Answer being sent to him privately, might there have rest<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, if his most reproach∣full and rayling reply, full of lyes, absurdities, contradictions, blas∣phemies, and intollerable scoffes and reproaches, had not forced me to send it abroad into the
<PB REF="7"/>
world to justifie it selfe from the rayling and slanderous clamours which he and his disciples, and factious followers have raised a∣gainst it, I here commend it to your grave censure, in hope that the goodnesse of the cause which herein I maintaine, will cover mine infirmities, and will stirre you up to perfect and finish what I have begun. The Truth for which you shall fight is strong, and will prevaile; all power, might, glory and victory is <HI>Gods,</HI> for whose cause you stand; and our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> on whose perfect <HI>rigteousnesse</HI> you strive to keep the Crown, hath all power given him in heaven and in earth. To this <HI>God</HI> eternall and omnipo∣tent, and to his eternall Sonne our Lord and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and to the most holy and blessed Spirit, three persons in one <HI>God,</HI>

<HEAD>THE ANSWERERS PREFACE To the first Chapter.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE question which is propounded and the state and drift thereof laid down in this first Chapter, is (in the Authors own words) this, whether the faith of him that truely beleeves, or the righteousnesse of CHRIST be im∣puted for righteousnesse in the act of justification. In this question the imputing of Faith is opposed to the imputing of Christs righte∣ousnesse,
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
for righteousnesse to ju∣stification, which no Orthodox Christian durst atten<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to doe at any time: for the godly learned in the Scriptures, and acquainted with the writings of Orthodox divines both ancient and Moderne from the time of the <HI>Apostles</HI> to this day, doe alwayes joyne Faith with <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse in the act of justification, and do never ac∣count them such opposites as doe the one exclude the other, and can∣not both stand together, and be re∣puted for righteousnesse to beleev∣ers in justification. Though the <HI>Apostle</HI> doth oppose justification by faith, to justification by works of the Law performed by every man in his owne person, as two op∣posites which cannot stand toge∣ther in GODS justification of sin∣ners; And this all true Christians receive, imbrace, and hold for a solid truth, and a fundamentall ar∣ticle of Christian Religion: Yet they abhorre and detest the oppo∣sing of Faith, and <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
in GODS imputing of righ∣teousnes to beleevers; and doe with an unanimous consent teach, that in this justifying act of GOD, <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse of which all true beleevers have communion, is that which GOD in a proper sense is said to accept, and repute for righteousnesse; and Faith as it re∣ceives and applies <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnesse, is said to be imputed, but in an improper speech; the name of the act being used to signifie the object, which we see frequently in Scripture, as for example, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.2.25. where the name (<HI>Faith</HI>) is used to signifie the thing belee∣ved, that is, the doctrine of the <HI>Gospell,</HI> and <HI>Coloss.</HI> 1.5. where the name [<HI>Hope</HI>] is used, to signifie the thing hoped for; that is, the inhe∣ritance and reward laid up for us in Heaven, of which kind many more instances may be produced. But as for them who have called into con∣troversie the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse; and having pro∣pounded this question, whether
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Faith or the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> is imputed in the act of justificati∣on, have set up Faith and thrust out <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, they have ever beene branded by all true Churches of <HI>Christ</HI> for pesti∣lent Heretikes, and enemies of GODS saving truth. The first mo∣ver of this question was one <HI>Petrus Abilardus,</HI> a pestilent and blasphe∣mous Heretick, who being full of the spirit of pride and error, did in disputing and writing, deny the communion of <HI>Christs</HI> perfect sa∣tisfaction, obedience and righte∣ousnesse; and the imputation of them for righteousnesse in the ju∣stification of true beleevers. This filthie wretch was gelded for cor∣rupting and defiling of a Maid, and for his blasphemous heresies, Saint <HI>Bernard,</HI> and the Bishops of <HI>France</HI> caused him to be excommu∣nicated and condemned for an He∣retike, and his blasphemous books to be burned publikely.</P>
<P>The next instrument of the De∣vill after him mentioned in former
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Histories was <HI>Servetus</HI> that blas∣phemous Heretike, who for here∣sies and blasphemies which hee dispersed as a vagabond in seve∣ral Countries, in divers books, was by Master <HI>Calvin</HI> discovered &amp; ap∣prehended at <HI>Geneva,</HI> condem∣ned and burned, and dyed blas∣pheming <HI>Christ</HI> most horribly, as <HI>Beza</HI> testifieth, <HI>in vita Calvini.</HI></P>
<P>The third notorious Heretike who in writing and bookes publi∣shed, did maintaine this wicked errour, and by his Disciples disper∣sed it in <HI>Transilvania, Polonia,</HI> and other adjoyning Countries, was <HI>Faustus Socinus,</HI> whose blasphe∣mous faction and sect still continu∣eth, and infesteth those Countries at this day.</P>
<P>The fourth Grand Master and propagatour of this heresie, who brought it into Holland nearer un∣to us was <HI>Arminius</HI>; He did first secretly teach and instill it into the eares and hearts of many disciples; and afterwards did openly pro∣fesse it, as we read in his Epistle
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<HI>ad Hyppolytum de collibus,</HI> wherein he confesseth that he held, Faith to be imputed for righteousnesse to justification, not in a Metonymicall, but in a proper sense: And al∣though this and other errours held by him are condemned in the late Synod of <HI>Dort</HI>: yet his disciples the Remonstrants doe obstinately persist in this errour, though some of that sect, would seeme to decline and disclaime it.</P>
<P>The fift perverse publisher of this heresie, who first openly pro∣fessed it in <HI>England,</HI> and in manu∣script Pamphlets and Printed Bookes, dispersed it in <HI>London,</HI> and from thence into severall pla∣ces of the Countrie about 28. yeares agoe, was <HI>Anthony Wotton,</HI> who being discovered and hotly opposed by the Author of this an∣swer was by his zeale, and the in∣dustrie of some other Preachers in <HI>London</HI> quickly quelled, and his opinion suppressed: but yet be∣cause he would uphold a secret fa∣ction, he wrote a booke in Latine,
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
wherein he seemed to retract, or rather to run from some desperate opinions and speeches, which are to bee seene in his private manu∣scripts given by him from hand to hand, and formerly dispersed. For whereas in divers of them he pro∣fesseth in plaine words, his dissent from all our Orthodox Divines, which had beene before written of Justification, saying, I am in∣forced to dissent from them all; He in that booke laboured to make a shew of consent with them, and did wrest some of their doubtfull speeches to countenance his Soci∣nianisme. This booke intituled <HI>De Reconciliatione</HI> some of his fi∣ery factious, and zealous disciples with much difficulty, after it was rejected at <HI>Leiden</HI> and <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI> procured it to be printed at their owne cost, brought over the Copies and sold them under hand in <HI>London.</HI> And out of it (wee may justly suspect, that this Scrib∣ler and babler hath stollen the most part of his conclusions, argu∣ments
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
and distinctions, for I am informed that he is a great admi∣rer of that book, and of the Author also. So that if this Socinian <HI>Iohn</HI> will and must needs have, and u∣surpe that high Title which our Sa∣viour gave to <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist, and will bee called (as his disciples stick not to stile him) the shining light of the Church in these last dayes: Surely he is but a borrow∣ed light or rather a wandring light, like that <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> which in darke nights leadeth the follow∣ers into ditches, loggs, praecip∣ces, and breakneck downfalls, as the Philosophers write of it.</P>
<P>For the recalling of the ignorant who are by him seduced, for the confounding of them who are by him perverted, and for the stop∣ping of the foule lying, and slan∣derous mouthes of those factious sectaries his followers, of a scar∣red conscience, who as they have his person in high admiration, so also are bold to revise and defame all godly and learned Preachers,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
who oppose his errours and preach against them. I will spend a few spare houres to sift his written dis∣course, at least so much of it as is come to my hands; hoping by evidence of truth, plaine Scrip∣tures, solid reasons, and testimo∣nies of the best writers, to make it manifest to GODS people, that he is a mere Socinian Sophister, and dangerous seducer, and that his discourse is an hotch potch of pestilent errours, and full of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gi∣versations, contradictions, and per∣verse wrestlings of Scriptures, and of the words and writings both of Ancient and moderne Divines. And that neither he himselfe▪ nor his clamarous disciples may have the least colour, or occasion to complaine, that I have not dealt fairely with him. I will first set downe his Socinianisme, word for word out of his owne writings, without concealing any word or sentence. And to every part there∣of I will oppose the contrary do∣ctrine of <HI>Christ</HI> under the name
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
of Christianisme. And first I be∣gin with his preface, with which he begins his first Chapter.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>The Preface to Socini∣anisme.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the cleare understanding of the state and drift of the que∣stion, something would be premi∣sed, which for the evidence sake might be privileddg and exemp∣ted, from passing under much dis∣pute and contradiction: yet if any thing be not sufficiently prepared for assent in the briefe proposall of it, the ensuing discourse will la∣bour to reconcile the disproporti∣on; And in the progresse make sa∣tisfaction for what it shall receive upon curtesie in the beginning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The Answer to the Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THis short Preface doth by the affected stile, and phrase of it discover the Author to bee one, who hath studied to preach him∣selfe
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
more then <HI>Christ,</HI> and to set forth his owne absurd conceits in the entising words of carnall wise∣dome, not to declare the Testimo∣ny of GOD in Apostolicall plaine∣nesse, nor in demonstration of the Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12.</NOTE> and of power as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> did. The loftie words, and short cut speech which hee useth here, and in this ensuing discourse, are so farre beyond the capacity of his rude unlearned followers, that his wooden pulpit shall assoone as they understand them, unlesse he first teach them his Gramma∣ticall skill, before hee admit them into his Theologicall auditorie. But belike hee knowes the ready way to catch the wavering, unsta∣ble, and giddie multitude, those wandering Starres of these last times, who are like clowdes with∣out water▪ carried about with windes of every new and strange Doctrine, and of all people are the fittest to bee his disciples. For the mouth which speaketh great swelling words, is admired of
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
them who have mens persons in admiration; and farre fetcht phra∣ses are fine fooleries to tickle the itching eares, and win the hearts of such as desire to seeme and bee counted something, when indeed they are nothing but bubbles, and empty bladders, who as they ad∣mire every bewitching <HI>Simon Ma∣gus,</HI> as the great power of GOD, and extoll to the Skies his most cursed errours: So they abhorre and revile all sincere and godly Preachers, rebukers of their mad∣nesse, blaspheme GODS word in their mouthes, and speake evill of the good things, which they un∣derstand not, untill in the gain∣saying of <HI>Core</HI> they utterly perish.</P>
<P>Moreover, to give him his due, he appeares to mee in his stile and phrase, a very skilfull Artist in his owne way, as cunning as the sub∣tle Serpent, in cloathing and trim∣ming his strange Doctrines, with strange conceited words fited to them, by which they who affect strange novelties, may easily be al∣lured
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
and insnared. But when the children of truth hunt him by the smell, and strong savours of his rankling errours (which stink as well as fret like an eating Cancer) and are ready to catch him; hee doth by his inkhorne termes so obscure and darken his meaning, that onely they who have a sharp, quick and strong sight, can lay fast and sure hold on him. Wee may well resemble him to the crafty fish <HI>Sepia</HI> of which we read, that when she is pursued and ready to be taken, she spueth forth a black inke wherewith she darkneth the waters round about, and so escapes away in thick darknesse, through which she cannot be seene and di∣scerned.</P>
<P>But to omit his stile, and to come to the matter of his preface, it is a promise and pretence of somewhat by him premised, which shall serve for the cleare under∣standing of the state of the que∣stion, and for evidence sake might be priviledged, from passing un∣der

<HEAD>The Analysis of his first Chapter in generall.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> THe first Chapter of his Socinia∣nisme, which he cals his premi∣sing of somewhat for cleare under∣derstanding of the state, and drift of the question, consists of sixe parts. In the first part he goeth about to rehearse the severall sig∣nifications of the words justifica∣tion
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
and justifying, and to deter∣mine in what sense the words are used in those Scriptures, which speake of the justification of a sin∣ner before GOD.</P>
<P>In the second he layes downe <MILESTONE N="2"/> 4. Propositions, which he takes for granted on all hands, and by none denyed but Heretikes.</P>
<P>In the third he comes to speak of imputation of righteousnesse, for <MILESTONE N="3"/> justification, or rather of somewhat which God in the act of every mans justification doth impute, for or instead of righteousnesse, to in∣vest him in all priviledges of a man perfectly righteous; and with∣all to shew the reason of this im∣putation, and afterward to de∣termine that Faith is that <HI>some∣what</HI> imputed.</P>
<P>In the fourth part hee shewes first negatively, how Faith is not <MILESTONE N="4"/> imputed, and excludes out of his question fiue severally <HI>quaeres.</HI> Se∣condly affirmatively, that Faith (as he holds it to be imputed) is opposed to the righteousnesse of
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
<HI>Christ,</HI> as to a competitor which receives the repulse.</P>
<P>In the fift part (to cover the <MILESTONE N="5"/> shame and scandall of his Hereti∣call opinion) he doth admit <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse into part of the ho∣nour for peace, and fashion sake, as <HI>Esau</HI> was admitted unto some vanishing participation▪ of some temporary blessings with <HI>Iacob.</HI> For he forgeth a strange and false kind of imaginary imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, unto which he laboureth to wrest the words of <HI>Luther, Calvin,</HI> and the Ho∣milies and Articles of our English Church.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/> In the last part hee undertaketh to shew more light, that it may be seene to the bottome clearely, what he affirmes and what he de∣nyes in the question propounded; The particulars whereof we shall see when I come to the answer of them.

<P>THat the termes of Justifying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Part.</HI></NOTE> Justification, &amp;c. are not to be taken in this question, (nor in any other that are usually moved about the Justification of a sinner) either 1. <HI>Physico sensu,</HI> in a Phy∣sicall sence; as if Justification signified to make just with any ha∣bituall, actual, or any positive, or inhaerent righteousnesse. 2. <HI>Sen∣su forensi proprie dicto,</HI> in a juridi∣call, or judiciary sense, properly so called, when the Judge hath onely a subordinate or derived power of judging, and is bound by oath, or otherwise, to give sentence ac∣cording to the rule of the Law; as to justify were to pronounce a man just▪ or to absolve him from punishment, according to the strict termes or rules of that Law wher∣of he was accused, as a transgres∣sor, though this sense be received, and admitted by many. But 3. and lastly, <HI>Sensu forensi improprie

dicto,</HI> in a Iudiciary sense lesse pro∣perly, and usually so called. <HI>viz.</HI> Where he that sits Judge, being supreme Magistrate, hath an Inde∣pendency, and Soveraignety of power, to moderate, and dispense with the Law, as reason and equi∣ty shall require: So that justify∣ing in this question, imports the discharging or absolving of a man from the guilt, blame, and punish∣ment of those things, whereof he is or might justly be accused; not because he is cleare of such things, or justifiable according to the let∣ter and strictnesse of the Law, (for then he could not be justly accu∣sed) But because the Judge ha∣ving a sufficient, and lawfull So∣veraignety of power, is willing upon sufficient, and weighty con∣sideration, knowne unto himselfe, to remit the penalty of the Law, and to deliver and discharge him, as if he were an Innocent, and righteous man. As for that Phy∣sicall sence of making just by in∣haerent righteousnesse, though <HI>Bel∣larmine</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
and his Angels, earnestly contend for it, yet till the Scrip∣tures be brought low, and Etymo∣logie exalted above them; til use and custome of speaking, deliver up their Kingdome into the <HI>Car∣dinalls</HI> hand; that sense must no way be acknowledg'd, or receiv'd, in this dispute: yet, (to give rea∣son and right, even unto those that demand that which is unreasona∣ble) Its true, that GOD, in, and up∣on a mans Justification begins to justifie him Physically, that is to infuse habituall, and inhaerent righteousnesse into him. But here the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and the <HI>Cardinall,</HI> are as far out in termes, as in 1000. other things they are in substance and matter: That which hee will needs cal Justification, the <HI>Scripture</HI> will as peremptorily call Sanctifi∣cation. Concerning that other sense of judiciary Justification, u∣sually so called; wherein the Iudge, or justifier, proceeds upon legall grounds, to acquit, and absolve the party guilty, and accused, neither
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
can this be taken in the question propounded, except the <HI>Scripture</HI> be forsaken, because the <HI>Scripture</HI> constantly speakes of this act of GOD, Iustifying a sinner, not as of such an act whereby he will either make him, or pronounce him le∣gally Iust, or declare him not to have offended the Law, and here∣upon justifie him, but as of such an act whereby he freely forgives him all that he hath done against the Law, and acquits him from all blame, and punishment due by the Law, for such offences: So that in that very act of GOD, by which he justifies a sinner, as there is a discharge from all punishment due unto sinne, so there is a profession withall, or plaine intimation of the guiltinesse of the person, now to be justified, according to the Law, and that he is not acquited, or discharged, upon any consi∣deration that can be pleaded for him according to the Law: but that consideration upon which GOD proceeds to justifie him is of another order: the consideration
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
of somewhat done for him in this case, to relieve him out of the course or order and appointment of the Law. He whose Justifica∣tion stands (whether in whole or in part, it's not materiall here) in the forgivenesse of sinne, can in no construction be said to be Iustified according to the Law, because the Law knowes no forgivenesse of sinne, neither is there any rule for any such thing, nor the least inti∣mation of so much as any possibi∣lity of any such thing there. The Law speakes of the curse, death, and condemnation of a sinner; but for the Justification of a sinner, it neither takes knowledge nor gives any hope thereof.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="Christian response">
<HEAD>Christianisme.</HEAD>
<P>IN this first part here are onely three significations of the word Justification, and Iustifying, rehear∣sed. The first is Naturall, or Physi∣call; that is, making a man just with habituall inhaerent righte∣ousnesse.</P>
<P>The second is a Iudiciary sense,
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
properly so called, when a subor∣dinate Iudge doth according to the strict termes, and rules of the Law, acquit, and absolve a man from punishment (which is due by the Law to him being a transgressor) and doth pronounce him just.</P>
<P>The third is a Iudiciary sense, lesse properly so called, when a su∣preme Iudge, by soveraignety of power, doth acquit and absolve a man, and remit the penalty of the Law, which he deserves, upon weighty consideration, knowne to himselfe, and doth deliver him, and discharge him, as if he were an innocent, and righteous man.</P>
<P>The first Physicall sense, he re∣jects, and playes upon <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> for reteining, and using the word Iustifie, in that sense: And yet he himselfe immediatly acknowledg∣eth, that GOD upon a mans Iustifi∣cation, begins to Iustifie him Phy∣sically, by infusing into him habi∣tuall, and inhaerent righteous∣nesse: But this (he saith) is in <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> called Sanctification.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="19"/>The second sense he also dis∣claimes, and in this dispute em∣braceth the third sense, to wit, that Iustification signifies GODS forgiving a man freely all that he hath done against the Law; and his acquiting, and discharging of a man from the guilt, and punish∣ment, due by the Law, for such offences; not for any considerati∣on which can be pleaded for him, according to the Law, but for som∣what done for him in this case, to relieve him out of the course, or∣der, and appointment of the Law: His reason why he embraceth this sense, is because he conceives Iu∣stification to stand in forgivenesse of sinne, which belongs to the Law in no respect at all.</P>
<P>In all this part, and passage, I find not one particle of solid truth, but many grosse errors, and fals∣hoods; for of all the three signifi∣cations, of the word Iustifie, by him here named, onely the first may passe in some tollerable con∣struction, but not in his sense: for
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>
though GOD in the creation made our first Parents after his owne I∣mage and similitude, in perfect righteousnesse, indued with a na∣turall, and habituall uprightnesse, conformable to his revealed will, and Law; and in this respect may be said to have Iustified, that is, made them upright, as the wise Preacher saith, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7.29. <HI>GOD made man upright</HI>: Yet whether this act of creation was a Physicall act of GOD, or rather a voluntary act of his will &amp; of his wisdome, and counsell, and so may be called Artificial, is something disputable. As for the framing and making of the man <HI>Christ,</HI> the blessed seed, by the power of the holy <HI>Ghost,</HI> pure, holy, upright, and iust from his first conception; this was a spirituall and supernaturall act, and the holinesse and righteousnesse was a supernaturall gift given from above, not introduced by naturall generation, nor raised from naturall principles. That making of men righteous in their
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
sanctification, which <HI>Bellarmine</HI> speaks of, is not iustification in a naturall, but in a spirituall sense▪ For the spirit of GOD worketh those habits, and graces of holi∣nesse in men, whom GOD hath be∣gotten of his owne will in the word of truth. And therefore when <HI>Bellarmine</HI> or <HI>Goodwin,</HI> or any other call this a Physicall iu∣stifying, they erre grossely. For if it be any iustification at all, it is spirituall and morall. But for my part, I finde not that by the Spirit of GOD in Scripture, any habituall holinesse of men begun in this life, is called righteousnesse simply in it selfe. But as the Saints regenerate, and faithfull are cal∣led righteous in respect of their communion with <HI>Christ,</HI> and participation of his righteousnes: So their sanctity or habituall holi∣nesse, is called righteousnesse, not simply in it selfe, but by coniuncti∣on with the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> the head of the body: which as it iustifies them by con∣stituting
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
and making them righte∣ous: so also it iustifies their re∣ctified holy actions, which they performe by the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of the spirit, and by Faith in <HI>Christ,</HI> (as learned <HI>Beza</HI> well observed, and truth affirmeth. <HI>Lib. contra Ano∣nymum,</HI>) and their sanctification cannot be called iustification, but by reason of coniunction with iu∣stification in the same person. For if it were possible for a sinfull man to be made perfectly holy, and conformable to GODS Law, in his owne person: yet having former∣ly transgressed the Law, and failed in many things; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w confor∣mity to the Law, by reason of those sinnes, and failings will prove a lame righteousnesse, not fit to satisfie the Law, and to be accepted for perfect righteousnesse to justification, because if a man keepe the whole Law, and faile in one point, he is guilty of all. <HI>Iam.</HI> 2, 10. No righteousnesse can justifie, which is not a perfect obedience, and conformity of the
<PB N="27" REF="21"/>
whole man, to the whol, law in his whole life, frō the beginning to the end. Secondly, that signification of the word Iustification, which hee calls a judiciary sense, properly so called, is, (as he describes it) a foolish fiction of his owne braine: for never did any but a mad-man dreame of Iustifying sinners by a subordinate Judge, absolving them from punishment, according to the strict termes, and rules of the Law; for that were to give a false sentence, and to pronounce a man free from all transgression of the Law, and a perfect fulfiller of it in his owne person. All our lear∣ned, and Iudicious Divines, doe hold that the full satisfaction and obedience of CHRIST being com∣municated, and imputed to true believers, they are absolved, and have their sinnes pardoned, and are counted, and iudged righteous by GOD: as men who have satis∣fied the Iustice, and iust Law of GOD, by CHRIST their head, and surety, not in their own persons, which the Law in strict termes requires, &amp; this is justification in
<PB N="28" REF="22"/>
the Iudiciary sense, which is ap∣proved by the learned.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that Iudiciary sense, improperly so called, which he ap∣proves, &amp; allows in this dispute, is an Hereticall, and Socinian con∣ceipt; for so long as GOD the su∣preme Iudge of all the world, is immutable, and infinite in Iustice, he neither can, nor will dispense with his eternall iust Law, in any iot, or tittle, but will have it per∣fectly fulfilled either by our selves or some sufficient surety in our be∣halfe, and will forgive no sinner, without a full suffering, and satis∣faction, made to the Law in the same kind which the law requires, though not in every mans person; and this full satisfaction must be communicated to every one, and made his owne by union, with CHRIST his head; before that GOD will iudge or account him righteous, and pardon al his sinnes. To imagin a somewhat, in conside∣ration whereof GOD forgives sin∣ners, and accepts them as if they
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>
were righteous; besides, the full satisfaction of GODS Justice, and just law, is to conceive GOD to bee mutable, and not the same in his infinite justice at all times; and to affirme it, is Samosatenian, and <HI>Socinian</HI> Blasphemy.</P>
<P>Fourthly, in arguing against the second sense by him propounded, he wrestles with his owne sha∣dow, and fights against a fiction of his owne braine, and discovers his blindnesse, and ignorance of the dictinction, and difference be∣tweene Legal, and Evangelicall justification, and righteousnesse: Legal righteousnesse is the condi∣tion of the first covenāt of works, and consists in perfect conformity, and obedience to the law, perfor∣med by every man in his owne person, and no man can be legally justified but by his owne personall righteousnesse. Evangelicall righ∣teousnesse, is CHRISTS perfect righteousnesse, and fulfilling of the Law in the behalfe of all the elect and faithfull: It was not the
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
Law, nor our works of the Law, which moved GOD to give CHRIST to be our surety and re∣deemer; but he of his owne free love and bounty gave <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> the Sonne of GOD out of his love, humbled himselfe to be∣come man, and to fulfill the law for us. Neither doe wee obtaine Communion of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction and righteousnesse, by the workes of the Law; but by the Gospell preached &amp; believed as the Apostle teacheth, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.2. And therefore though <HI>Christ</HI> his righteousnes be a perfect fulfilling of all obedience, which the law requires of man; &amp; GOD did exact of him every far∣thing, of our debt, both in active, and passive obedience, and in re∣spect of the matter and substance, his satisfaction may be called after a sort legall, and is so called by <HI>Lu∣ther:</HI> yet as it was for us, not for himselfe, and performed by him our head, not by every one of us in our owne persons, and is recei∣ved and applied by Faith, not by
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
our workes of the Law, and is brought unto us by the Gospell, not by the Law, and is given to us freely by GODS grace, not merited or procured by any thing in our selves; so it is not legall but Evangelicall, and GODS justi∣fying of us, and counting us righ∣teous by it, is not a proceeding upon legall grounds, nor pronoun∣cing us legally just, as this calum∣niator doth, either foolishly ima∣gine, or falsely slander and misre∣port our Doctrine.</P>
<P>Fiftly in arguing for his owne false, and forged sense of the word Justification, he hath three reasons all which are for us, and prove our Doctrine not his opinion. For if this make a sense of the word Justification, good, because it doth intimate the former guilti∣nesse of him that is justified, as wel as it doth discharge him from all punishment, (which is his first reason) then is our Doctrine of ju∣stification by imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction for all our sinnes, very
<PB N="32" REF="24"/>
good and sound, for it intimates a guiltinesse in him who is to bee iustified, as well as a discharge from punishment. Secondly we doe not plead for our iustifica∣tion, any consideration according to the Law, that is, wee doe not plead our owne innocency, nor satisfaction and righteousnes per∣formed in our own persons; but we plead more then somewhat done for us, even all <HI>Christs</HI> obedience active and passive, by GODS free grace communicated to us, not obtained, or merited by our works of the law. Thirdly though the law iustifies no sinner, but threa∣tens the curse, death▪ and condem∣nation as the due reward of the transgressors of it: Yet it iustifies all who are free from all sinnes committed against it, and are made righteous by the perfect fulfilling of it to the utmost. And there∣fore when the Gospell hath brought us to the Communion of <HI>Christs</HI> full satisfaction, by which we are made free from all sinne,
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
and perfect fulfillers of the law in him our head; as GOD doth for∣give us our sinnes, and counts us righteous: so the law is no more against us, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9. but is witnesse for us, that in <HI>Christ</HI> we are worthy of remission and iusti∣fication. By this are manifest the grosse errours, and absurdities which he uttereth in this first part of his preparative Chapter.</P>
<P>But that his ignorance in the Doctrine of justification, may more fully appeare, I will lay downe the severall significations of the words, justification, and ju∣stifying, wherein the Spirit of God doth use them in the holy Scrip∣tures.</P>
<P>First the word iustifie, and iu∣stification <MILESTONE N="1"/> signifie, making men righteous, or constituting or set∣ing them in the state of righteous∣nesse. This signification is justifi∣ed by several testimonies of Scrip∣ture, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. Where ma∣ny are said to be made, or constitu∣ted righteous by the obedience of
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
<HI>Christ,</HI> even as by <HI>Adams</HI> disobe∣dience many were made sinners, and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. Where <HI>Christ</HI> is said to bee made unto us righteousnesse, and wee are said to be made the righteous∣nesse of God in him. And <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. and 4, 5. Where we are said to be iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in <HI>Christ.</HI> And God is said to ju∣stifie the ungodly, which cannot be meant of counting judging, and pronouncing, but of making them righteous by the Communion of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse. For to iu∣stifie the wicked by judging and pronouncing them righteous, without making them such, is a∣o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mination to the LORD, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.15. And in this sense Prea∣chers of GODS Word are, as in∣struments under GOD, said to iu∣stifie many by bringing them un∣to righteousnesse, and are called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> iustifiers, <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.3. This iustifying wee may very fitly call radicall, or fundamentall iu∣stification.
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
This <HI>Luther</HI> and o∣ther learned Divines call <HI>actionem individuam,</HI> because it is GODS action of communicating <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse in a moment, and not by degrees successively, and in it men are mere patients, and do not worke with GOD, no more then <HI>Adam</HI> did in GODS first crea∣ting of him upright, in his Image: Even regenerate Infants may thus be iustified, and are iustified before they actually beleeve.</P>
<P>Secondly the word iustifie, sig∣nifieth GODS iustifying of men by <MILESTONE N="2"/> Faith, that is, his counting and re∣puting them righteous, upon their actuall beleeving, and his enable∣ing them to feele themselves par∣takers of the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> and to enioy it by Faith, in this sense the word is used, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. Where GOD is said to iustifie us by imputing righteousnesse, and counting Faith for righteous∣nesse, that is, counting a true be∣leever a righteous person. And thus the word is to bee taken,
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
where we are said to bee iustified by Faith, without the workes of the Law. The Apostle doth much urge, and presse this iustification, <HI>Rom▪</HI> 4 and <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. because though in this taken actively, GOD onely acteth: yet taken passively as it is received of us, and we by Faith feele and discerne in what account we are with GOD, and by beleev∣ing enioy <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction for remission of sinnes, and for righte∣ousnes, wee may be said to worke with GOD, by way of receiving, as a begging hand doth in receiv∣ing gifts freely given, and put into it. This iustifying doth necessa∣rily presuppose the former, and doth assure us of it. For the iust GOD, whose iudgement is accord∣ing to truth, cannot r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pute us righteous, till we have communi∣on of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, and be thereby truly righteous. And this Justification Divines call im∣putative. It springs from the for∣mer as from the root, and is buil∣ded on it as on the foundation.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="26"/>Thirdly, this word iustifie, sig∣nifies a manifesting and declaring of men to be righteous and iustifi∣ed, and that three wayes. First in <HI>foro conscientiae,</HI> in the court, or iudgement of our own conscience, when a man being troubled in his conscience with the sight of his sinnes, and his want of righteous∣nesse, after humble prayer, and poenitent seeking, receives either the inward testimony of the Spi∣rit, and is enlightned by GOD, to see that he is in the state of righte∣ousnesse absolved and iustified; or by inward sense of his sanctifica∣tion, Faith, and other graces pro∣per to the righteous iustified; is declared and made manifest to his owne conscience, that he is justi∣fied and righteous, and hath all his sinnes pardoned, and is accept∣ed of GOD for a righteous man. This is that which wee are taught by <HI>Christ</HI> to pray for in that peti∣tion, forgive us our debts or tres∣passes, that is, pacify and cleare our consciences, by manifesting to
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
us that we are justified, and have remission of all our sinnes by thy free grace, and by communion of <HI>Christs</HI> full satisfaction; and thus wee are to understand the word, wheresoever it is opposed to the accusations of Satan, and the horrours and troubles of consci∣ence, as a remedie against them, as <HI>Rom▪</HI> 8.33.</P>
<P>Secondly it signifies declaring, and proving men righteous <HI>in foro humano,</HI> in the judgement and sight of men openly, and that by outward fruites of Faith, and externall workes of righteousnes, and holinesse. When GOD enable∣ing us, and moving us to doe such workes, and bring forth such fruites as are by his word conti∣nually pronounced, and proclaim∣ed to be righteous, and holy works and evidences of justification, doth thus declare, and prove us to be faithfull and righteous, hee is said to justifie us before men. In this sense the word is used, <HI>Iob</HI> 13.18. where <HI>Iob</HI> saith that if hee
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
may plead before GOD the inte∣grity of his life, he knoweth hee shall be justified: as afterward he did <HI>cap.</HI> 31. and was thereby de∣clared to be righteous, and so justi∣fied. And <HI>Iam.</HI> 2.21. where it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="broken type" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that <HI>Abraham</HI> was justified by workes, that is, declared to be a righteous man.</P>
<P>Thirdly it signifies judging, and declaring men to bee persons ju∣stified, and righteous in the uni∣versall judgement at the last day, when the <HI>LORD Christ</HI> shall by the evidence of their workes of love and charity, done to him in his members, declare them to bee his faithfull servants, and children of his Father, justified by the communion of his righteousnes, and in him worthie of eternall life; and also adjudge them unto the inheritance of the kingdome of Glory. In this sense the word is used, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.16.18. where it is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Justificati∣on of life, and is opposed to the sentence of everlasting condemna∣tion.
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
These are all the significa∣tions of the word (iustifie) recor∣ded in the Scriptures; And this great promiser here sheweth him∣selfe ignorant of them all: and therefore how little satisfaction he hath given to any, but such fooles as delight to fill themselves with huskes, let the learned iudge.</P>

<P>IN this second part he doth pro∣mise foure severall propositions, which hee conceives to bee out
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>
of question, and undenyable. By the first proposition hee makes a faire shew in words, but his heart is farre removed, and his meaning is wicked, and so will appeare, if we observe how hee in another place afterwards explaines him∣selfe. First though hee seemes to acknowledge <HI>Christ</HI> to bee GOD, yet he takes away the use of his being, GOD as well as man in the worke of our redemption. For if GOD by his supreme sovereigne power can dispense with the law of his iustice, and instead of <HI>Christs</HI> full satisfaction made for us to the law, and imputed to us, and made ours, can and doth accept our weake Faith for the perfect righ∣teousnesse of the Law; what use is there of <HI>Christs</HI> being GOD in our nature? For all Orthodox Di∣vines doe give this reason, why it was necessary that <HI>Christ</HI> should be GOD in our nature. <HI>viz.</HI> That his suffering and righteousnesse performed in our nature, might be of value to iustifie all the sonnes of
<PB N="44" REF="31"/>
men, who have communion of them, and to whom they are im∣puted. This communion and im∣putation while he denyeth, hee takes away the use of <HI>Christs</HI> being <HI>GOD</HI> in our nature.</P>
<P>Secondly, in affirming that <HI>Christ</HI> obeyed the whole Law in e∣very letter, jot, and title, he doth mock, and delude his hearers, and readers; for he doth not hold, that he fulfilled the Law onely for us, but primarily for himselfe; his words imply so much, for he saith, he obeyed the Law, as far as concerned himselfe, while he con∣tinued in the flesh: and he dorh hereafter roundly affirme, that <HI>Christ</HI> was bound to fulfill the Law for himselfe, which is in ef∣fect, a denying of his eternall God-head: for if he be GOD, infi∣nite in glory, and excellency, his God-head must needes exempt the Manhood personally united to it from all bondage of the Law, and make it worthy of glory at GODS right hand, from the first
<PB N="45" REF="31"/>
assumption of it. He continued in the flesh, and obeyed the Law, onely for us without all doubt, as the <HI>Prophet</HI> foretold, <HI>Esa.</HI> 9.6. saying, <HI>To us a Child is borne, and to us a Son is given.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, as he denies the satis∣faction of <HI>Christ</HI> to be imputed to us, so he denies the imputation of our sinnes to <HI>Christ</HI>; and that ve∣ry closely, and cunningly, under colour of that challenge which <HI>Christ</HI> made to the Iewes, which of you can convince me of sinne? For our Saviour speakes of sinne committed by himselfe, and such aspersion none can say upon him; But all our iniquities GOD laid upon him, and he bare all our sinnes, <HI>Esa.</HI> 53. <HI>And was made sinne for us,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5, 21. and to cast this aspersion of all our sinnes on him, is a sure foundation of the peace, and safety of the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>In the second proposition, hee doth most notoriously aequivocate, and play the Hypocrite; First in that he seemes to acknowledg the
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>
sacrifice of <HI>Christ</HI> to be an attone∣ment, and satisfaction for the world, and a propitiatory sacrifice for the sinne of it. Secondly, in that he denyeth his Lord, and Master <HI>Socinus,</HI> and calles the Spi∣rit which wrought in him a Spirit of error; whereas indeed he him∣selfe is lead by the same Spirit, and doth deny <HI>Christ</HI> to be the propiti∣atory sacrifice for our sinnes, as far as <HI>Socinus</HI> ever did: For in a pro∣pitiatory sacrifice, offered to purge sinne, and to make attonement, there were three necessary requi∣sits: First, the thing offered, must be of his owne proper goods, for whom it was offered, so the Law required, and therefore <HI>David</HI> durst not offer for his sinne, that which was not his owne, Purcha∣sed with his money, 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 24, 24. Secondly, the owner, whose expiatory sacrifice it was, did lay his hand upon the head of the Beast which was to be offered, and thereby in a type imposed all his sinne, and guilt upon it, so that
<PB N="47" REF="32"/>
it became <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> his sin, &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> his guilt, <HI>Levit</HI> 5, 6. and <HI>Exod.</HI> 30.10. and did beare upon it all his sins, <HI>Lev.</HI> 16.22. Thirdly, this sa∣crifice offered up by the Priest in that manner which GOD praescri∣bed in the Law, GOD accepted as a propitiation for him, it was set on his skore, and covered his sinne, as the Hebrew words signi∣fie, <HI>Levit.</HI> 1.4. He who denies any one of these, overthrowes the sacrifice of attonement. Now this dissembler doth with Socinus de∣ny all these things in <HI>Christs</HI> offe∣ring of himselfe a sacrifice of at∣tonement to purge sinne. First he denies the true reall Spirituall uni∣on betweene <HI>Christ,</HI> and the per∣sons pardoned, and justified; by which <HI>Christ,</HI> and they are made one body, and hee is their head, and they his members; For if he, and the faithfull be one, then all his goods are theirs, and their debts are his, and his satisfaction, and righteousnesse is theirs, and is set on their skore, which he denyeth,
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>
and altogether opposeth, and so denyes their interest, and proprie∣ty in <HI>Christ,</HI> and their union with him, as his Master <HI>Wotton</HI> did, in expresse word: In his Essayes of Justification. Secondly, he also denieth that the sinnes of the faith∣full, were layd on <HI>Christ,</HI> and im∣puted to him; and in this he char∣geth GOD, with notorious in∣justice, who laid the punishments of all our sinnes on <HI>Christ,</HI> without the sinnes: For he saith, that <HI>Christ</HI> bare the punishmēts, though hee had no share in our sinnes by any imputation. Thirdly, he de∣nyeth that the sacrifice of <HI>Christs</HI> suffering, and obedience offered up by him, is imputed to us, set on our skore, and accepted for us. And thus in the doctrine of <HI>Christs</HI> sanitisfaction, and attonement, he declares himselfe a true disciple of Socinus, lead by the same spirit of error, and of the same opinion, though in words he denyes it. And what he here seemes to grant, is no more but what all Socinians yeeld unto.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="33"/>In the third proposition, viz. that <HI>Christ</HI> is the sole, and entire miraculous cause, of every mans justification, &amp;c. Hee doth aequi∣vocate, and delude the simple, and while hee deceives them, hee is deceived himselfe, as the Apostle saith of wicked seducers, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3, 13. For if he doth understand his owne words, that <HI>Christ</HI> is the sole meritorious cause of every mans justification, that is justified by GOD, he must needs grant that <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction, made to GODS justice, and his perfect righteousnesse, as it is meritorious, and of great value in it selfe; so it is appropriated, communicated, &amp; imputed to him; that is, it is made actually meritorious for him, and makes him worthy to be counted righteous, and to be iustified; for his words signify so much, though hee is in his purpose and meaning, as contrary, as darknesse is to light: for he meanes no more, but that <HI>Christ</HI> meritted for himselfe, that GOD should gratifie, and ho∣nour
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
him with the justification of those that believe in him, so hee explaines himselfe in the last words. It is certaine that a thing may be merritorious in it selfe, for the worth of it, but it cannot be meritorious to any particular per∣son, till it be appropriated to him▪ and set on his skore. <HI>Wotton</HI> his Master, (this point being proved to his face with undeniable argu∣ments) was driven to disclaime the word (merit) denyed <HI>Christs</HI> meritting, for the faithfull, and rejected it as a thing not named in <HI>Scripture,</HI> in his Essayes of Justifi∣cation. Besides this deceiving of himself<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and misconceiving of his owne words, I find here much ab∣surdity: First, in that he is wa∣vering, and not setled in his Iudg∣ment, for in many places he holds faith to be the righteousnesse of a man justified; and here he calles absolvtion from sinne, and con∣demnation, the righteousnesse which is given to every man in his justification: I grant that in
<PB N="51" REF="34"/>
a man iustified, there is no righte∣ousnesse inhaerent, but his cleane∣nesse from guilt of all sinnes, both of commission, and omission, and in this sense, <HI>Calvin, Luther,</HI> and others say that all the righteous∣nesse, in a man iustified, is the re∣mission of his sinnes, that is, his cleanenesse from the guilt of them, but this is not the righteousnesse which iustifieth him, and which is communicated to him, to make him cleane, and to worke this cleannesse from the guilt of his sin, that is, the righteousnesse inhae∣rent in <HI>Christ,</HI> which makes him cleane, and puts him in a stare of righteousnesse before GOD: but this profound Doctor, with that stamp, and superscription of ratio∣nall authority, which hee concei∣veth to be set on him, hath not yet searched into the deep things o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, he is most absurd in imagining that <HI>Christ</HI> hath pur∣chased favour, and honour, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>GOD,</HI> that he might iustifie the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>
that believe in him by Procuring, that faith in a proper sense should be accepted for righteousnesse: For <HI>Christ</HI> as he was GOD, &amp; man, was infinitely of himselfe in fa∣vour and honour with GOD, and humbled himselfe onely for us▪ and in our behalfe fulfilled the Law; not to purchace honour, and fa∣vour, to himselfe, nor to make himselfe worthy to be gratified, and honored by GOD, as hee affir∣meth. Thus wee see his absurdi∣ties, and his deceiving of him∣selfe.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"/> The fourth proposition is, that faith in the judgement of e∣very man, is the condition requi∣red by GOD, on mans part, to bring him into that communion of justification, and redemption, which <HI>Christ</HI> hath purchased &amp;c. In which I finde delusion, and fals∣hood: First hee doth not meane a gift, grace, or Spirituall qualifica∣tion, appointed by GOD, by which as by the hand of the soule stretch∣ed out, wee must lay hold on
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>
<HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction, and righteous∣nesse▪ for justification, and redemp∣tion, (though his words pretend so much) but hee meanes that faith is the condition of the new cove∣nant, which man must on his part performe, in stead of all righteous∣nesse, which the Law requires; and so it is in the new covenant, the condition of life; as workes of the Law, and of righteousnesse, were the condition of the old co∣venant: This is the very haeresie, and damned error of Socinus. Se∣condly, he doth here make the co∣venant of grace, a covenant of life, not freely, but upon a condition▪ performed on mans part, and so a covenant of workes, contrary to <HI>Scripture, Rom.</HI> 11.6. Thirdly, hee erres grossly, in imagining faith not to be a free gift of grace, but a worke performed on mans part, as workes were required in the old covenant. Fourthly, hee falsely chargeth all honest, and godly men, to be of his judgment. I know that all Orthodox <HI>Divines,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="36"/>
abhorre and detest this opinion. Fiftly, hee affirmes a manifest un∣truth, in saying, that without be∣leeving, none can have part in justi∣fication, and redemption; for no regenerate Infants, which die in their Infancy, do actually believe▪ and yet being by the Spirit of re∣generation engraffed into <HI>Christ,</HI> they have communion of his ran∣some and righteousnesse, are justifi∣ed before <HI>GOD,</HI> and saved.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="Socinian position">
<HEAD>Socinianisme.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3. <HI>Part.</HI></NOTE>IT's evident from the Scriptures, that GOD in the act of every mans justification doth impute, or account righteousnes to him, or ra∣ther somewhat for, or in stead of righteousnes, by meanes of which imputed, the person justified pas∣seth in account as a righteous man (though hee be not properly, or perfectly such) and is invested ac∣cordingly with those great privi∣ledges of a man perfectly righte∣ous,
<PB N="55" REF="36"/>
deliverance from death and condemnation, and acceptation into favour with GOD. The rea∣son of which imputation, or why GOD is pleased to use an expressi∣on of righteousnesse imputed, in or about the justification of a sin∣ner, seemes to be this, the better to satisfie the naturall scruple of the weake, and feeble conscience of men, who can hardly conceive, or thinke of a justification or of being justified, especially by GOD, without a perfect legall righteous∣nesse. Now the purpose and coun∣sell of GOD in the Gospell, being to justifie men without any such righteousnesse: the better to salve the feares of the conscience touch∣ing such a defect, and to prevent and stay all troublesome thoughts, or quaeres which might arise in the mindes of men, who when they heare of being justified, are still ready to aske within them∣selves, but where is the righteous∣nesse▪ conceiving a legall righte∣ousnes to be as necessary to justifi∣cation,
<PB N="56" REF="37"/>
as <HI>Isaac</HI> conceived of a Lamb for a burnt offering, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22. He (GOD I meane) is graci∣ously pleased so far to condescend to men in Scripture treatie, with them about the weighty businesse of justification, as in effect to grant and say to them, that though hee findes no proper or perfect righteousnes in them, no such righteousnesse as passeth under the name of righteousnes with them: yet if they truely beleeve in him as <HI>Abraham</HI> did; this beleeving shall be as good as a perfect com∣pleat righteousnes unto them, or that hee will impute rihteousnes to them upon their beleeving.</P>

<P>THe first thing in this passage, to wit, GOD imputing righ∣teousnesse to every man in his ju∣stification, is a thing evident by the Scriptures, and I willingly grant it. But I abhorre and de∣test as heresie, that which he adds out of his owne conceit, to wit, that GOD doth rather impute
<PB N="41" REF="37"/>
somewhat in stead of righteous∣nes, which cannot make a man properly or perfectly righteous. This is a blasphemous imagination, that GOD can iudge falsly, and account a thing for righteousnes which is not, and esteeme a man righteous who is not properly righteous. Secondly that which immediately followes is no lesse blasphemous, to wit, that a man may be invested by GOD, with the great priviledges of a man per∣fectly righteous, namely deliv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rance from sinne and condemnati∣on, and acceptation, into favour with GOD, though he be no such man. For hereby GOD is charg∣ed either with injustice and ini∣quitie, or with errour in his judge∣ment. Thirdly his taking upon him to give a reason of GODS purpose, and counsell, is Lucife∣rian pride and presumption. For who knoweth the minde of GOD, or hath beene of his counsell, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.34. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> who was taken up into the third hea∣ven,
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>
could never finde out any such counsell of GOD, neither durst give a reason of GODS pur∣pose and counsell, but onely the good pleasure of his owne will. Fourthly in the declaration of his reason I find many errours, and untruths, as first, that a mans con∣science can hardly thinke of being justified by GOD, without a per∣fect legall righteousnesse. Every regenerate man and true beleever can upon his owne knowledge, and experience give him the lye, and tell him that the weakest con∣science of any, who hath true Faith, being taught by the Gospell, can very easily thinke and beleeve, that GOD justifies him by an E∣vangelicall righteousnesse, even <HI>Christs</HI> perfect fulfilling of the Law, which is farre more perfect then that legall righteousnesse, which the Law requires of every man in his owne person. This <HI>Abraham</HI> beleeved, and was fully perswaded of it, this <HI>David</HI> pro∣fesses, and Saint <HI>Paul</HI> preached, and
<PB N="55" REF="38"/>
I know no true Christian, who doth not both thinke and beleeve it. If any man be found doubting of this, it is because the spirit of <HI>Antichrist</HI> and <HI>Socinus</HI> doth worke strongly in him. Secondly the thing which he imagineth, being so notoriously false there can be no reason given of it, but a reason as false as the thing it self. And indeed so it is here. For first hee assure, most falsely that GODS purpose in the Gospell, is to justifie men without any such righteousnesse, as the Law requires in every man, that is the perfect fulfilling of the Law. For though <HI>GOD</HI> doth not purpose to iustifie men by their owne fulfilling of the Law, every one in his owne person: yet by <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse and his ful∣filling of the Law in their stead, and by communicating and impu∣ting that righteousnesse to them, he purposeth in the Gospell, and professeth that men shall bee and are by him iustified, and this is in <HI>Christ</HI> such a righteousnes as the
<PB N="60" REF="39"/>
Law requires, for proofe of this see <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.4. and 10.4. Second∣ly the fathers upon <HI>GOD</HI> his own false and wicked conceits, to wit First, that <HI>GOD</HI> goeth about to cure an infirmity in his people, which is not to be found in any of them, after they are called to be∣leeve in <HI>Christ,</HI> and to be his peo∣ple; for then they bid their owne workes of the Law adiew, and do no more dreame of iustification by them. Secondly, that <HI>GOD</HI> for the cure of their weak consci∣ences tells them in the Gospell, that if they beleeve in <HI>Christ,</HI> this beleeving shall bee as good as a perfect compleat righteousnesse: by this hee would make <HI>GOD</HI> a pure <HI>Socinian,</HI> one who takes the Crowne from <HI>Christ,</HI> and the righ∣teousnes from <HI>GOD</HI> and man, and sets it on the head of mans Faith, which in the best beleevers, and even in <HI>Abraham</HI> himselfe was mingled with much doubting, and many infirmities. In a word, though all Orthodox Divines doe
<PB N="61" REF="39"/>
according to the Scriptures, ac∣knowledge that upon a mans be∣leeving truly in <HI>Christ, GOD</HI> doth impute to him the perfect, and compleat righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> which is made his before he can truly apply it by Faith. Yet it can never enter into the heart of a true Christian, but his soule will abhorre to thinke, that any mans beleeving should bee to him as good, as perfect compleat righte∣ousnes, or that <HI>GOD</HI> should ac∣cept it in stead of perfect righte∣ousnesse, and rather then the righ∣teousnes of <HI>Christ GOD</HI> and man, who is made unto us of <HI>GOD</HI> righteousnes, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. and in whom we are found to have the righteousnes of <HI>GOD</HI> by faith, <HI>Philip.</HI> 3.9. To conclude this passage, let me adde this as a foule absurdity. For if hee speake by experience, that conscience leads men naturally to thinke that there can be no iustification without righteousnesse, which is a perfect fulfilling of the Law. Which I
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>
confesse my conscience and my rea∣son tell mee, and <HI>GODS</HI> word teacheth▪ mee plainely: Then what is become of his consci∣ence, who contrary to all truth and reason, and the common con∣science of all men, will teach iusti∣fication, without any true righ∣teousnesse at all either of <HI>Christ,</HI> or our owne, and will crowne mans weak Faith with the Crown of righteousnesse, which onely belongs to <HI>Christ</HI> and his perfect obedience.</P>

<P>SO that now the state and drift of the question is, not either First whether Faith without an ob∣ject or as separated from <HI>Christ,</HI> bee imputed for righteousnesse; for such a Faith (doubtles) in the point of justification was never dreamt of by any man, that kept his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> company; men may as well fancy a living man without a soul<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or a wise man without his

<P>IN the fourth part, or passage, he first propounds five foolish quae∣res, which he denieth to concerne the state of the question.

I will first particu∣larly answere the 5. quaeres: and after lay downe the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at large, and addresse my selfe to the confu∣tation of his discourse upon it.</P>
<P>And first, whereas he pronoun∣ceth him a mad man, who dreames of faith without <HI>Christ</HI> the object, or thinks that faith which be∣lieves not in <HI>Christ,</HI> should be im∣puted for righteousnesse: Here I must be bold to put him in mind; that thus he dreames in the next Chapter, where he boldly affirmes and by divers arguments labour∣eth,
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>
to prove that the Faith of <HI>A∣braham</HI> which was imputed to him for righteousnes, was not a beleeving in <HI>Christ,</HI> neither was <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteousnes the object of it. And therefore by his owne confession and his owne wordes; hee doth there play the mad man, and keepes not his wits company, but his fancy runs wild, while he strives to prove that <HI>A∣brahams</HI> Faith imputed to him for righteousnesse was not a beleeving in <HI>Christ.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The second Quaere.</HEAD>
<P>NEither is it any part of the intent of the question, to en∣quire, whether Faith bee the me∣ritorious cause of a mans justifica∣tion.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>HEre behold either grosse ig∣norance or wilfull lying a∣gainst knowledge, and conscience. For all the learned know that Faith and beleeving are held by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to be a prin∣cipall part of mans righteousnesse, and workes which GOD imputes and accounts meritorious, of justi∣fication, and of eternall life <HI>ex condigno.</HI> Yea he himselfe in the passage next before hath plainely affirmed, that Faith to him that beleeveth as <HI>Abraham</HI> did, is as good as perfect and compleat righteousnes; which if it be true, then Faith must needs be, (as per∣fect and compleat righteousnesse is) the meritorious cause of ju∣stification. And therefore that which he here saith is verified in
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>
himselfe, though he would seeme most to disclaime the merit of Faith, and to cast it furthest from him, yet in some of his most be∣loved tenets, hee drawes very neare to it, yea hee embraceth it with his heart in his whole dis∣course, the maine drift whereof is to exalt Faith into the place of <HI>Christs</HI> most meritorious righte∣ousnesse, and to put the Crowne upon it. For what can be imagi∣ned more meritorious of justifica∣tion, then that which GOD in a proper sense judgeth and counteth for righteousnes, and for which he doth justifie men, and counts them righteous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="question">
<HEAD>The third Quaere.</HEAD>
<P>NEither is it the question, whether faith be the formall cause of justification, that is, whe∣ther GOD doth justifie a man with his faith, as a Painter makes a wall white with whitenes, or as a Master makes his Scholler lear∣ned
<PB N="67" REF="42"/>
with knowledge, or learning conveyed into him; for both par∣ties make the forme of justificati∣on to be somewhat really different from Faith (which is the genuine tenet of <HI>Arminius</HI>▪)</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>THis quere is very ridiculous, for to imagine a quality or act in man, to be the formall cause of ju∣stification which is GODS act, is the fancy of a distempered braine, and the conceit of a mad man. His exposition of his quaere shews his want of Logicall skill. For the whitenesse wherewith the Painter makes a wall white, is a forme in∣troduced into the wall, it is not the formall cause of his action of painting; and so learning pro∣duced in a scholler, is <HI>forma docti,</HI> the forme of a Scholler as hee is made learned, not the for∣mall cause, of his masters teaching, surely his expounding of his quae∣re, by such dissonant similitudes,
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>
sheweth that hee had need of a Master to teach him some better knowledg, and learning, and to set on him some better stamp, and superscription, of rationall autho∣rity. His phrase (of learning con∣veyed) is somewhat improper, for learning is not conveyed, in∣to a Scholer, but produced, and begotten, in him. Let him not therefore condemne tropes of speech, seeing he himselfe can, and doth often speak tropically, and improperly.</P>
<P>But to come home to his quae∣re. If by justification hee meanes imputative justification, in which GOD justifies a man, by imputing righteousnesse to him; and man is justified by believing that GOD counts him righteous in <HI>Christ</HI>; then wee deny not that faith in some respect, is the formall cause of justification: For in this justifi∣cation taken passively, as it is mans receiving by faith, that which GOD imputes to him; that is, as it is a mans believing, that
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>
God reckons him among the righ∣teous, and counts him to be in the state of a justified person; so his actuall faith, and believing, is the forme of his justification: But take Justification, according to his owne opinion, for GODS impute∣ing faith in a proper sense, for righ∣teousnesse; Then is faith that somewhat, by which a man stands in the state of a person Justified before GOD, even his formall righ∣teousnesse, or that at least, which is in stead of formall righteousnes. Thus he is every way taken, and entangled in his owne words. Lastly, what that is, which hee saith is the genuine tenet of <HI>Armi∣nius</HI>; hee doth not expresse whe∣ther it be, that faith is really diffe∣rent, or not different, from the forme of Justification; for his words are included in a parenthe∣sis, which might very well be left out: onely this I know, that <HI>Ar∣minius</HI> professeth this to be his ge∣nuine tenet; That faith is impu∣ted to the beleever, for righteous∣nes.
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>
<HI>sensu proprio, non m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tonymico,</HI> in a proper sense, without a trope, <HI>In Epist. ad Hippolitum de Collibus,</HI> If elsewhere hee alters his tenet, and writes otherwise; It is but the common disease, the vertigo, and giddinesse of the Socinian faction, to doe as here their fellow disciple doth in this his hovering, and wavering discourse; that is, to say, and gainesay, affirme, and deny, the same things, through the in∣constancy of their windy braines, and mindes unsetled.</P>

<P>TO this question laid downe in plaine, and precise termes, I an∣swer. First that to move this que∣stion, except with purpose to dis∣cover and oppose <HI>Socinus,</HI> and his followers who affirme it, and stand for imputation of faith in a pro∣per sense; for righteousnes is not to be tolerated among true Chri∣stians: but to dispute for that damned errour, which takes the Crowne from the all-sufficient
<PB N="76" REF="47"/>
righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> and sets on the head of mans weake faith, is most hereticall impudency (as in my whole answere I shall prove aboundantly. Secondly his absurd expounding of Justification by <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes imputed; and how in this question the righte∣ousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the iustifying of men by it, are to be understood; is a notable point either of calum∣ny in slandering our doctrine, and reporting it corruptly, or of sub∣tilty, that when his opinion is pro∣ved to be blasphemous, hee may have some starting holes, through which hee may shift away, and make an escape, pleading that hee mistooke our Doctrine of be∣ing righteous by <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nesse imputed, and ignorantly did oppose it.</P>
<P>First no man standing for the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nes, doth affirme that every parti∣cular act of <HI>Christ</HI> which hee per∣formed, was necessary to make up a perfect and sufficient righteous∣nes:
<PB N="77" REF="47"/>
but that his righteousnesse containes in it all his acts of obedi∣ence, none denyeth. For suppose our Saviour by reason of impri∣sonment, or some other restraint and impediment, had beene hin∣dered from doing divers of those workes of mercy, charity and pie∣ty, which hee did performe being at liberty, this had not diminished his righteousnes, so long as he had a ready will to doe good upon all occasions, and did good workes when liberty and opportunity ser∣ved. Secondly none of our Di∣vines doe thinke or write, that <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes imputed, and communicated to beleevers, doth make them rigidly, literally, and peremptorily righteous, constitu∣ted and made us perfectly com∣pleatly and legally righteous, as <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe, for though they are iustifi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Communion of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction, and have so much interest in it, as to make them truely righteous, yet they have it not as <HI>Christ</HI> hath it per∣formed
<PB N="78" REF="48"/>
legally by himselfe in his owne person; neither have they power to give the Spirit, where∣by they may communicate it to o∣thers to justifie them, &amp; to make them righteous. The Wife is en∣dowed with her Husbands ho∣nours and riches, and made honou∣rable and rich, but she is not en∣dowed with her Husbands Lord∣ship and dominion over them, so far that she may give them away at her pleasure: but onely posses∣eth them in him and with him, for her owne use. And so it is betweene <HI>Christ</HI> and the faithfull, he is righteous rigidly and legally, according to the letter of the Law; They are righteous Evangelically by the Communion of his righte∣ousnes, that is, originally righte∣ous, as the head in a naturall body is sensitive, and hath sense and motion in it as the root and foun∣taine: They are righteous by Communion from him, and pos∣sesse his righteousnes as all the rest of the members, in a living body

possesse life by derivation from the heart, not in the same degree as the heart doth, to communicate it to others; but every one so far as to be a living member. There∣fore all that hee here saith is but subtilty, calumny, and false∣hood, neither <HI>Scriptures</HI> nor any sound and learned Authors will mi∣nister arguments, or demonstrati∣ons to him to prove any thing con∣trary to our Doctrine, concerning the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes for iustification. The more he strives to wrest and abuse testi∣monies of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and learned Authors, the more evident de∣monstrations will he give of his wickednesse, and wilfull conten∣ding against GODS sacred truth.</P>

<P>GIve me leave here to menti∣on that by the way, which prevents many mistakes (yea and offences too) in reading the wri∣tings of many later Divines (espe∣cially
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>
of other Churches) touch∣ing this point of Justification. If we take the phrase of imputing <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes unproperly, and out of the usuall and formall signification of it (as <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and other Divines of the reformed Churches sometimes doe in their writings) <HI>viz</HI> For the giving out and bestowing (as it were) the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> in the returne of it, that is, in the priviledges, blessings and bene∣fits, that are procured and pur∣chased by it for men: So a belee∣ver may be said to be justified by the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> impu∣ted. But then the meaning can be no more but this. A beleever is justified by the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes. That is, GOD justifies a beleever for <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes sake, and not for any righteousnes of his owne. Such an imputation of the righte∣ousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> as this is, is no wayes denyed or once questioned. And thus such passages as those in
<PB N="81" REF="49"/>
<HI>Calvin,</HI> GOD freely justifies us by imputing the obedience of <HI>Christ</HI> unto us, <HI>Instit.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 3.11, and a∣gaine a man is not righteous in himselfe, but because the righte∣ousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> is communica∣ted, or imparted to him by impu∣tation, these and such like expres∣sions in this Author, are to be in∣terpreted by such passages as these (which are frequent in the same Author) <HI>Christ</HI> by his obedience, procured and merited for us, grace and favour with GOD the Father, and againe <HI>Instit.</HI> 1.2.17. and againe, 1.3. <HI>c.</HI> 11.12. <HI>Christ</HI> by his obedience procured, or purchased righteousnes for us. And againe, in <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.6. All such expressions as these import the same thing, that wee are ju∣stified by the grace of GOD, that <HI>Christ</HI> is our righteousnesse; and that righteousnes was procured for us by the death, and resurre∣ction of <HI>Christ.</HI> By all which passages and many more of like importment, that might be pro∣duced
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>
out of the same Author, its fully evident, that where he men∣tions any imputation of the righ∣teousnes of <HI>Christs</HI> in justification, the meaning is onely this, that the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> is onely the meritorious cause of our justifica∣tion, and hee hath procured and purchased this for us at GODS hand; that upon our beleeving we should bee accounted righte∣ous by him; or (which is but the same) that our faith should be imputed for righteousnes to us. To which purpose hee speakes more significantly, and expressely in the place last mentioned, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.6. men not having righteousnes lodged in them, they obtaine it by imputation, which imputation he thus explicates and interprets. Because GOD doth impute or ac∣count their faith unto them, for righteousnes. Divers like passa∣ges might be drawne together out of other Authors, which must be seasoned with the same salt of in∣terpretation, to bee made savorie
<PB N="83" REF="50"/>
and meet for spirituall nourish∣ment. In the Homilies of our Church, there are severall passa∣ges that mention the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes in justifi∣cation, for the genuine sense whereof if wee consult with the 11. article of Religion (which is concerning justification) and is framed with all possible exactnes this way (that so few words are capable of) that will lead us directly to the same interpretation of them. Wee are accounted righteous before GOD, (saith our Article) onely for the merit of our LORD, and Saviour <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> by faith, and not for our owne workes or deservings. Where its to be observed, that we are not said to bee constituted, or made righteous before GOD in justifi∣cation, but onely that we are ac∣counted or reputed such. 2. Its not said that wee are accounted righteous with the righteousnes, nor yet with the merit of <HI>Christ,</HI> but onely wee are accounted righ∣teous
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>
before GOD, onely for the merit of our LORD <HI>Christ</HI> by faith. The merit of <HI>Christ</HI> or of his righ∣teousnes, hath so farre prevailed with GOD on our behalfe, that by our faith we shall bee accounted righteous before him; which is in effect the same truth wee main∣taine. <HI>viz.</HI> that GOD for <HI>Christs</HI> sake, or for <HI>Christs</HI> merits sake doth impute our faith for righte∣ousnes unto us. And thus <HI>Mus∣culus</HI> expresseth himselfe roundly. Faith is accounted for righteous∣nes for <HI>Christs</HI> sake; And againe <HI>Loc. com. de justifica.</HI> This faith ought to be esteemed of us, as that which GOD purposeth for <HI>Christs</HI> sake, to impute for righteousnes to those that beleeve in him. So <HI>Luther</HI> also <HI>ad Gal.</HI> 3.6. GOD for <HI>Christs</HI> sake accounts this im∣perfect faith for perfect righte∣ousnes. And <HI>Chamier</HI> calls remis∣sion of sinnes, the righteousnes which is imputed to us. There∣fore wheresoever, whether in the Homilies of our Church▪ or in o∣ther
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>
Authors we meet with any such expressions of the righteous∣nes of <HI>Christ</HI> imputed in justifica∣tion; wee must not understand this righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> in the letter, propriety, and formality of it, but in the Spirit, or merit of it to be imputed. And this manner of speech to put the name of a thing in the propriety of it, instead of the value, worth, benefit, and returne of it, is both usuall, and fa∣miliar in ordinary passage, of dis∣course amongst us, and very fre∣quent in the <HI>Scriptures</HI>; when we say, a Merchant grew rich by such, or such a commodity, our mean∣ing is, that hee grew rich by the gaine, or returne of it, hee may be made rich by the commodity, and yet have never a whit of it with him; so when we say, such a man grew rich by his place or office, our meaning is, that he grew rich by such gaine, or profit, as his office afforded him; we do not meane that the place it selfe, or office, were his riches; so it may
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>
be said, that wee are justified by the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> and yet not have the righteousnesse it selfe upon us by imputation, or o∣therwise, but onely a righteous∣nesse procured, and purchased by it, really, and essentially, differing from it, viz. remission of sinnes, as will appeare in due time: Thus in the <HI>Scriptures</HI> themselves there is no figure, or forme of speech more frequent, then to name the thing it selfe in the propriety of it in the stead of the fruite of it, good or bad, benefit, or losse, vantage or disadvantage, merit, or deme∣rit of it. Thus <HI>Iob</HI> 33.26. <HI>GOD</HI> is said to render unto man his righteousnesse, the fruit and bene∣fit of his righteousnesse in the fa∣vour of <HI>GOD,</HI> and manifestation of it in his deliverance, and restau∣ration; the righteousnesse it selfe in the propriety of it, cannot bee rendered unto him: So <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6.8.

<P>THis fifth part, or passage, is no∣thing else, but first the pro∣pounding of a new, and strange imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nesse contrary to sense and reasō, &amp; to the common signification of the phrase of imputing righteousnesse, or counting a thing for righteous∣nesse. Secondly, a wresting, and abusing, of some speeches of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and learned writers, that hee may father on them, an opini∣on, which they abhorred, and in expresse words, disclaimed, and confuted.</P>
<P>First, hee saith, that the phrase of imputing <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, is by <HI>Luther, Calvin,</HI> and other Divines, taken unproperly, and out of the usuall, and formall sig∣nification,
<PB N="89" REF="53"/>
for the giving, and be∣stowing of the returne, that is, the priviledges, blessings, and be∣nefits, which are purchased by <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, for men; and the meaning can be no more but this; that GOD justifies a be∣liever, for <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse sake, and not for any righteousnes of his owne. To this I answere, First, that this signification of the phrase, is so unproper, unusual, &amp; deformed, that it is never found in all the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> nor any appro∣ved Author (as hereafter I shall make manifest) onely Socinus, &amp; they of his faction are coiners, and forgers, of such strange barba∣rismes. Secondly, it is so contrary to common sense, and reason, that if any man should say, the Sun, the ayre, or other Elements are impu∣ted to us by GOD, because GOD hath given us the benefit of them; every man would laugh at such a barbarisme, even the most simple would discerne it to be ridiculous. If Master <HI>Goodwin,</HI> or any of his
<PB N="90" REF="54"/>
disciples, comeing into some coun∣try house for shelter from some cruel tempest, which overtooke him as hee travelled on his journy, should for the benefit which hee received under the mans roofe, presently chaleng, that the house is imputed to him, and is to be coun∣ted his, and set on his skore, it is a thousand to one, that the owner of the house, would take him for a mad man, and put a fooles feather in his cap, or cast him out of the doores, by the head and shoulders, for a sawcy companion: hee had not best therefore use such speech∣es, nor write such phrases with his pen, for if they once proceed out of his mouth, and come to other mens eares, hee will thereby purchase to himselfe much scorne and derision. But let us proceed to examine the instances, by which hee goeth a∣bout to proue this strange signifi∣cation, of the word imputing righ∣teousnesse, wherein righteousnesse is put for the fruit of it by a meto∣nymie of the cause for the effect;
<PB N="91" REF="54"/>
imputing is put for bestowing by a new <HI>Socinian</HI> trope, and GODS bestowing, for mans receiving, by a monstrous metonymie, of one opposit for another: I wonder here by the way, how this man (who disclaimes in the next Chapter, the <HI>Apostles</HI> using of tropes and figures in the waighty Doctrine of justi∣fication, and calles it a monster of speech to use two tropes in one phrase) dares here make in this one phrase, so many tropes, and mon∣strous figures.</P>
<P>The first instance, which hee brings to prove that <HI>Calvin</HI> did use the phrase in this signification is this; GOD freely justifies us, by imputing <HI>Christs</HI> obedience to us: and againe, a man is not righteous in himselfe; but because the righ∣teousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> is communica∣ted, and imparted to him by impu∣tation. I might here blame his false quotations, to wit, <HI>Instit.</HI> 1. c 3.1.11. and 1.2.17. and 1.3.14.17. In which places no such wordes are to be found; but I
<PB N="92" REF="55"/>
willingly embrace these words as <HI>Calvins,</HI> for they are most cleare, and manifest to prove that <HI>GOD</HI> not onely give us the returne or be∣nefits of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, but also doth by imputation commu∣nicate, and impart to us the righ∣teousnesse it selfe: so that if this man had studied all his dayes, to contradict his owne opinion, and to confute his forged signification, hee could not have found more ful, plaine, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rspicuous words then these of <HI>Calvin</HI>; for if a man bee not righteous in himselfe, then is hee not righteous by faith in a proper sense, for his faith in a pro∣per sense, is in himselfe. But let us not bee too hastie to insult over his folly; it may bee his impuden∣cy will catch at some other words of <HI>Calvin,</HI> which do not so ex∣pressely contradict him, but are more obscure, and them hee will wrest, and abuse to expound <HI>Cal∣vins</HI> plaine words in a contradicto∣ry sense. It is even so indeed, for hee cites in the next place, some
<PB N="93" REF="55"/>
more generall and obscure speech∣es of <HI>Calvin,</HI> to expound his plaine words, and to make them contra∣dictory to themselves. I have heard absurd fellowes derided for going about to shew <HI>obscurum per∣obscurius,</HI> that is, to make men see dark things through greater dark∣nesse, and for running (as the pro∣verb is) out of <HI>GODS</HI> blessing, in∣to the warme sun: But that any should goe about, to make others see the sun, when it shineth in full strength, by the dimme light of a candle, and to perswade them that the sun is the moone; this is mad∣nes, &amp; deserves that the Lunatike, &amp; Melancholike person so doing should be sent to the Iland of <HI>Hel∣lebore,</HI> there to inhabit till hee re∣cover his wits. And doth not he so who seekes to make <HI>Calvins</HI> plaine words, to contradict them∣selves by citing words, where∣in he speakes neither so plainely, nor so fully as in them. But let us see those other speeches of <HI>Calvin,</HI> which hee brings for this
<PB N="94" REF="56"/>
purpose: one is, that <HI>Christ</HI> by his obedience hath merited, and procured for us favour with GOD his Father. These words doe not prove that the imputing of <HI>Christs</HI> obedience, and righteous∣nesse signifies the bestowing of the benefit of it on us, that is GODS favour: but shew clearely the contrary to that which he intends, namely that <HI>Christs</HI> obedience is made ours, and imputed to us, be∣cause it procures to us the favour of GOD, which we cannot enjoy, nor appeare gracious in his sight, unlesse wee bee cloathed, with <HI>Christs</HI> rich robe of righteousnes, and washed cleane from the guilt of sinne, by his satisfaction impu∣ted to us. Another is, <HI>Christ</HI> by his obedience hath purchased righteousnes for us; the true and plaine sense of which wordes, is no more but this, that <HI>Christ</HI> by his obedience hath fulfilled the Law of GOD for us, and we by that obedience are constituted &amp; made righteous, as the <HI>Apostle</HI> expresse∣ly
<PB N="95" REF="56"/>
affirmes, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. Another is that, when we are said to be justi∣fied by the grace of GOD, and that righteousnes was procured by the death, and resurrection of <HI>Christ</HI>: these expressions import the same thing with those, that <HI>Christ</HI> is our righteousnes, that is by union with him and commu∣nion of his righteousnes, which he purchased by his death and re∣surrection, and which GOD gra∣ciously gives to us, wee are justi∣fied. Another is, men having not any righteousnes in themselves, they obtaine it by imputation, that is, neither a mans owne workes, nor faith taken in a proper sense, for a gift grace or worke in him, can be his righteousnes, but onely that which is obtained by impu∣tation, to wit, <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nes apprehended by faith, which when true beleevers have laid hold on, then GOD doth account them righteous, and in this im∣proper sense GOD is said to im∣pute faith for righteousnes. Thus
<PB N="96" REF="57"/>
every speech of <HI>Calvin</HI> which he brings against <HI>Calvin</HI> himselfe, is like a stone cast against a brasen wall, and rebounds against the caster, and dasheth out the braines of his hereticall opinion. And therefore it was his safest course, onely to tell us of more such pas∣sages, but not to recite any more out of <HI>Calvin,</HI> or other Authors. For being seasoned with the salt of their owne interpretation, they will prove gravell in his mouth, choake him, (and if it be possible) put him to shame and silence.</P>
<P>From <HI>Calvin</HI> hee comes home to the Homilies allowed in our Church, and they by his owne confession teach, that we are justi∣fied by the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes. But to prove that by the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> they meane faith taken in a proper sense, that is, as it is the gift of faith in us, and the operation of it in us, even our beleeving: hee brings the words of the 11. Arti∣cle of Religion allowed in our
<PB N="97" REF="57"/>
Church by Law. <HI>viz.</HI> we are ac, counted righteous before GOD onely for the merit of our LORD and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> by faith, not for our owne workes or de∣serts; where note, that whereas the Articles send us to the Homilies, as being very profitable, &amp; plaine expositions of them; hee on the contrary sets the cart before the horses to draw them after it. Hee brings the text to expound the commentary or plaine exposition of it. But hee gets no advantage by doing so, for the words of the Article are very exact indeed, and make much for us against his opi∣nion, they shew that the merit of <HI>Christ</HI> apprehended by faith, is that for which wee are accounted righteous before GOD, and that faith is not our righteousnes, for then wee should bee accounted righteous for a grace in our selves, and for a worke of our owne, per∣formed by us, even our owne be∣leeving. Oh but the Article doth not say that wee are constituted,
<PB N="98" REF="58"/>
and made, but onely accounted righteous: True indeed, the Ar∣ticle doth not speak of fundamen∣tall justification mentioned, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. but of imputative justification, of which the <HI>Apostle</HI> speakes, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4, 3. which necessarily presup∣poseth the other: For GOD whose judgement is according to truth, cannot judge, and count us righ∣teous, till hee hath communicated <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse to us, and by it, constituted, and made us righte∣ous; which when we by faith, re∣ceive, and apply by the assistance of his Spirit, which dwells in us, and makes us one Spirituall, and mysticall body, with <HI>Christ</HI>; then GOD accounts us righteous, and by our faith, and believing, we ob∣tene, as <HI>Abraham</HI> did, this testi∣mony from GOD, that we are righ∣teous, as <HI>Iustine Martyr</HI> saith in the words cited in the next Chapter.</P>
<P>From the Article, and Homi∣lies, hee proceedes to <HI>Musculus, Luther,</HI> and <HI>Chamier,</HI> who, though

in their Doctrine they are opposit to his opinion, as heaven is to earth, yet hee snatcheth here, and there, some improper speeches out of their writings, which hee wresteth to his purpose; though they doe most plainely expound their owne meaneing to bee con∣trary to his mind. The words of <HI>Musculus</HI> are these, Faith is ac∣counted, for righteousnesse for <HI>Christs</HI> sake: That is, faith is ac∣counted for righteousnesse, and the true believer is counted a righte∣ous man: not <HI>sensu proprio, nec per se, sed propter Christum.</HI> That is, by reason of <HI>Christ,</HI> and his righte∣ousnesse, whom the believer ap∣prehendeth, and by faith posses∣seth his righteousnesse; and againe, this faith ought to be esteemed of us, as that which GOD purposeth for <HI>Christs</HI> sake to impute for righ∣teousnesse, to those that believe in him, in which words <HI>Musculus</HI> folowing the phrase of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> intends no more but this, that wee are not to seeke righteousnes
<PB N="100" REF="59"/>
by our owne workes, but by faith in <HI>Christ</HI> for if wee can obtaine grace to believe in him, and to lay hold on his righteousnesse; wee are for <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteous∣nesse sake, upon our believing counted righteous before GOD, be∣cause by our communion which wee have with <HI>Christ</HI> by the Spirit dwelling in us, and enabling us to believe, The righteousnesse of the Law is fulfilled in us imputatively, by the righteousnesse of another, e∣ven of <HI>Christ,</HI> which is also ours, for we are flesh of his flesh, that is▪ one with him; these are <HI>Mus∣culus</HI> his owne words, in which, hee roundly expresseth himselfe in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.4. and 10.3.4▪ <HI>Lu∣thers</HI> words, at which hee catcheth in vaine, are to the same purpose, in <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.6. GOD for <HI>Christs</HI> sake, accounts this imperfect faith, for perfect righteousnesse. Here <HI>Luther</HI> doth not charge GOD with error, or iniquity in judgement, by judgeing, and accounting, that for perfect righteousnesse, which is
<PB N="101" REF="59"/>
imperfect; for his speech is tro∣picall imitating the phrase of the <HI>Apostle</HI>; by imperfect faith hee meanes a true believer, by a weak faith, laying, hold on <HI>Christs</HI> righ∣teousnesse, and by perfect righte∣ousnesse a man set in a state of per∣fect righteousnesse by communi∣on with <HI>Christ</HI>; and this is the sense of the words, that if a true believer doth lay hold on <HI>Christ</HI> by faith, which in the best of us, is but weake, and imperfect; yet GOD accounts him perfectly righ∣teous, with the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> which is most perfect, and compleat. Thus <HI>Luther</HI> expounds himselfe, 1 <HI>Tom. pag</HI> 32. <HI>Editionis Ienensis: Christ</HI> (saith hee) is in us by faith, yea, one with us, but <HI>Christ</HI> is righteousnesse, and a ful∣filler of all GODS commaunde∣ments, therefore wee also doe by him fulfill all GODS commande∣ments, when hee is by faith made ours: And 2 <HI>Tom. pag.</HI> 515. Faith puts us upon <HI>Christs</HI> workes of righteousnesse, without our
<PB N="102" REF="60"/>
owne workes, and translates us out of the exile of our sinnes into the Kingdome of his righteousnes▪ And <HI>Tom.</HI> 1. <HI>pag</HI> 106. By faith, our sinnes are made no more our owne, but <HI>Christs,</HI> upon whom <HI>GOD</HI> hath laid the iniquities of us all? and againe, all <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nesse is made ours, for he layeth his hand on us: If a man had the tongue of men and Angels, hee could not speake more fully for the communion, and imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to believers, for justification, and of their sinnes to <HI>Christ</HI> for remission: then <HI>Luther</HI> doth in these, and divers other places, as I shall more fully shew in the second Chapter. As for <HI>Chamiers</HI> words, who calles remis∣sion of sinnes, the righteousnesse which is imputed to us; they shew that faith is not that imputed righ∣teousnesse, for faith, or believing, is our act; remission is <HI>GODS</HI> act▪ who can forgive sinnes but▪ <HI>GOD</HI>▪ But indeed▪ the meaning of <HI>Cha∣mier</HI> is the same with <HI>Calvin,</HI> to
<PB N="103" REF="60"/>
wit▪ that our cleannesse from the guilt of sinne, which is Passive, re∣mission, or justification, is that which GOD lookes upon in us, when hee counts us righteous in <HI>Christ,</HI> as I have before shewed: wherefore I conclude with the contradictory of his conclusion (which hee inferres upon the speeches of our Homilies, and of other learned Authors) to weet thus; That wheresoever we find in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> or any Authors of sound learning; this phrase of faith, or believing, imputed for righteousnesse, we must not un∣derstand faith in a proper sense, but the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> e∣ven his fulfilling of the Law for us, which together with the power, and merit of it, so far as every be∣liever hath need, is communicated to him, and imputed to him for justification: For as a Merchant cannot be, said to be enriched by the gaine of a commodity, which never was his owne, and in which hee never had any interest, or
<PB N="104" REF="61"/>
propriety, nor any man by an of∣fice which was never his owne, nor by him executed: So none can have the merit, and benefit of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, nor be said to bee thereby justified, neither can any such thing be imputed to them, except they have a proprie∣ty in it, and communion of it. Thus his instances, and similitudes, are turned against himselfe, to the confusion of his haereticall opini∣on. But that his sinne may ap∣peare out of measure sinfull, hee doth not content himselfe, with his abusing, wresting, and pervert∣ing of the godly sayings of other Authors, and using similitudes which are most contrary to his purpose; but hee also layeth pro∣fane hands, on the holy <HI>Scriptures.</HI> That excellent saying, <HI>Iob</HI> 33, 26. which Master <HI>Perkins</HI> learnedly ex∣pounds to be meant of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, which when men humbly seeke to <HI>GOD,</HI> by repen∣tance, and faithfull prayers, <HI>GOD</HI> renders unto them by renuing
<PB N="105" REF="61"/>
their sense and assurance of their communion with <HI>Christ</HI> in his whole satisfaction. This Doctor novice most Popishly applyes to a mans owne righteousnesse, and saith, that GODS rendring to a man his righteousnesse is giving him the benefit of it, not the righ∣teousnesse it selfe: And yet if wee should grant what hee perversely seekes, it will availe him no∣thing; for as the fruite, and bene∣fit, which GOD renders to a man, is not the fruit of a righteousnesse, in which he hath no propriety, or interest, but is his righteousnesse, so the fruite, and benefit, which we receive of <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nesse, <HI>GOD</HI> renders to us when that righteousnesse is become ours in the propriety of it: That place <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6.8. whatsoever good a man doth the same hee shall receive of the <HI>LORD</HI>: it is for us, and against himselfe, for as the good which a man receives from <HI>GOD</HI> for well doing, is the good fruite of his owne well doing,
<PB N="106" REF="62"/>
so is the fruite, and benefit which wee receive in our justification▪ the fruite of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes made ours, and imputed to us: Those speeches <HI>Revel.</HI> 13.10. and 15.10. here is the faith and pati∣ence of the Saints, &amp;c. are not to be understood of the fruite, and reward of their patience (as the circumstances shew, which are kil∣ling, and slaying, and leading into captivitie) but of the patience, and faith themselves, that in such times they are seene, tride, and proved, and <HI>GOD</HI> at such times gives them patience, and faith, by threat∣ning, and foretelling the finall de∣struction of their enemies; as learned <HI>Brightman</HI> truely ex∣pounds the wordes. Besides if patience and faith were here used to signifie the fruit, and benefit of patience and faith: yet he cannot say it is the fruit of any patience, or faith, but of the Saints them∣selves who receive the benefit. Likewise if wee grant, that in the other places <HI>Psal.</HI> 128.2. La∣bour
<PB N="107" REF="62"/>
signifies the fruit of labour, and <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.28. Sin signifies the punishment of sinne, and <HI>Gen.</HI> 19.15. iniquitie signifies the judge∣ment of GOD on <HI>Sodom</HI> for iniqui∣tie, by a trope or Metonymie of the cause for the effect. This proves that faith which is the hand, or instrument of the soule, receiving <HI>Christ</HI> with his righteousnes, may by the same trope be used to signifie that state of righteousnes, which we receive by it as by an hand or instrument. Thus while he runs against the in∣vincible rocke of the holy <HI>Scrip∣tures,</HI> and seekes to turne them like a rowling stone against a barke, they rowle and rebound back, and tumbling upon him grind him to powder· For if hee had ten thousand instances of <HI>Scripture,</HI> wherein the fruite and benefit which men receive, are signified by the names of the things which are the causes, and meanes of them▪ yet still it will appeare that the fruite is not re∣ceived
<PB N="108" REF="63"/>
except men have first an interest, and propriety in the cau∣ses and meanes of it. And thus you see his fift part, or passage proved to bee a rotten heap of stinking lyes, absurdities and grosse errors.</P>

<P>WHerefore to draw to∣wards the close of this first Chapter, and withall to give a little more light, that it may bee seene to the bottome cleerely, both what wee affirme, and what we deny in the question propoun∣ded: First when we affirme the faith of him that beleeveth to be imputed for righteousnes; The meaning is not either, 1<SUP>o</SUP>. That it <MILESTONE N="1"/> should be imputed in respect of a∣ny thing it hath from a man him∣selfe, or as it is a mans owne act, <MILESTONE N="2"/> nor yet in respect of any thing it hath from GOD himselfe, or from the spirit of GOD producing, &amp; raising of it in the soule (though
<PB N="109" REF="63"/>
it be true, it requires the lighting downe of the mighty arme of GOD, upon the soule to raise it. Neither 3<SUB>o</SUB> is it imputed for righteousnes in respect of the ob∣ject, or as, or because it layeth hold upon <HI>Christ,</HI> or his righte∣ousnes (though it be also true that that faith that is imputed for righ∣teousnes must of necessity lay hold upon <HI>Christ</HI>; and no other faith is cable of this imputation besides) because if faith should justifie or be imputed as it layes hold upon <HI>Christ,</HI> it should justifie out of the inhaerent dignity &amp; worth of it and by vertue of that which is naturall and intrinsecall to it, there being nothing that can be conceived more naturall, and essentiall to faith, then to lay hold upon <HI>Christ</HI>: this is the very life, and soul of it, and that which gives it its specificall being, and subsistence. Therefore to make the object of faith, (as such) the precise, and formall ground of its imputation, is to make hast into the midst of <HI>Samaria,</HI> whilest men are
<PB N="110" REF="64"/>
confident, they are travailing to∣wards <HI>Dotha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Its the giving of the right hand of felowship, to the Romish justification, which makes faith the meritorious cause of it (in part.)</P>
<P>But lastly, when with the <HI>Scrip∣tures</HI> we affirme that faith is im∣puted for righteousnesse: our meaning is simply, and plainely this, that as <HI>GOD</HI> in the first co∣venant of workes required an ab∣solute, and through obedience to the whole Law, with continuance in all things, for every mans justi∣fication, which perfect obedience had it beene performed had beene a perfect righteousnesse to the performer, and so would have justified him:</P>
<P>So now in the new covenant of grace, <HI>GOD</HI> requires nothing of any man for his justification, but onely faith in his Sonne, which faith, shal be as availeable, &amp; effect∣uall to him for his justification, as a perfect righteousnes should have beene under the first covenant:
<PB N="111" REF="64"/>
this is that which is meant when faith is said to bee imputed for righteousnes, which is nothing but that which is taught generally by Divines, both ancient and mo∣derne. <HI>Sic decretum dicit a Deo, ut cessante lege solam fidem gratia Dei posceret ad salutem. Ambrosius.</HI> In <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. that is, that the <HI>Apostle</HI> saying, that to him that beleeveth his faith is imputed for righteous∣nes, affirmeth that GOD hath de∣creed that the Law ceasing, the grace of GOD will require of men onely faith for salvation: and again upon Chap. 9. of the same Epistle, <HI>Sola fides posita est ad salutem,</HI> onely Faith is appointed to salvation. <HI>Calvin</HI> writing upon <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.8. hath wordes of the same impor∣tance, and somewhat more cleare, and full, <HI>ex hac distinctionis nota colligimus, sicut lex opera exigit, Evangelium nihil aliud postulas, nisi ut fidem afferrent homines ad recipi∣endam Dei gratiam:</HI> that is, from this distinction we gather, that as the Law exacted workes; so the
<PB N="112" REF="65"/>
Gospell requires nothing else, but that men bring faith to receive the grace of GOD. If GOD re∣quires faith in the Gospell, for that same end for which he requi∣reth workes, or perfect righte∣ousnes in the law; it necessarily followes that he shall impute this faith for that righteousnes, that is accept from men upon the same termes, and bee countable unto them the same favours, rewards, and priviledges upon it, that should have beene given unto men, in regard of that righteous∣nes, had it beene performed or fulfilled: otherwise he should re∣quire it for such an end, or upon such tearmes as hee would refuse to make good unto it, when the creature hath exhibited and ten∣dered it unto him. To require it for righteousnes, or in stead of righteousnes, and not to accept it for righteousnesse, when it is brought to him, should bee as ap∣parant a breach of Covenant with GOD, as it would be in a rich cre∣ditour,
<PB N="113" REF="65"/>
that should compound and agree with his poore debtors for 1. in the pound, or the like, but when they brought the mony to him, should refuse to take it upon any such tearmes, or to discharge them of their debt, and give them out their bonds.</P>

<P>IN this last part or passage which is a meere confusion, and distra∣ction of wordes, hee gives more then a little light, that his <HI>Socinian</HI> heresie in this point of justification maintained with much non sense, may bee seene to the bottome cleerely. First, hee takes upon him to shew that faith is impu∣ted, and how it is imputed. Se∣condly hee strives to shew that <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes is not impu∣ted. The first is in the wordes before recited. The second fol∣lowes hereafter. First I will sift his wordes already rehearsed, And after proceed to the second.
<PB N="114" REF="66"/>
The summe of his speech last reci∣ted, may be reduced into a Syllo∣gisme of non sense, without forme mood or figure. The proposition and assumption whereof are con∣tradictory. And the conclusion damned <HI>Socinian</HI> heresie, so that here I may say with the Poet. <HI>Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici?</HI></P>
<P>His proposition runnes thus. Faith is neither imputed for righ∣teousnes, in respect of any thing which it receives from man, the proper subject of it, nor as it is mans act who useth it, and per∣formes the acts of beleeving, nor in respect of any thing which it hath from GOD, or his spirit in the production of it, nor in respect of the object <HI>Christ</HI> and his righte∣ousnes, nor in respect of the life and soule of it, which gives to it the specificall being, and subsi∣stence, to wit, the application of <HI>Christ,</HI> and laying hold on him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="assumption">
<PB N="115" REF="66"/>
<HEAD>The Assumption.</HEAD>
<P>BVt faith is imputed to men, and is counted, and accepted as sufficiently for justification, and upon the same tearmes under the Gospell, as perfect righteousnes of workes and of obedience to the whole Law, was in the first co∣venant and under the Law: So all Divines hold both ancient and moderne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>THerefore upon mens beleev∣ing, GOD shall bee as countable to them, to give them the same favour, rewards and privileges, that should have beene given un∣to them in regard of the perfect righteousnesse of workes, and of the Law, if they had fulfilled it.</P>
<P>First for his negatives heaped up in the proposition, wherein wee have a narration of what he holds not: if we lay them altogether, they will conclude, that faith is
<PB N="116" REF="67"/>
no way at all imputed for righte∣ousnes, for neither in respect of the subject in which the habit of it resteth, nor in respect of the actes which man performes by it, nor in respect of any thing, which GOD by his spirit gives it in the production of it, that is, for no quantity quality, or vertue in it, nor in respect of the object <HI>Christ,</HI> nor in respect of the life, soule, or forme which gives it the specifi∣call being, and subsistence, so hee plainely professeth, and besides these there is no other respect in which it may bee imputed, as al reasonable men do know. There∣fore the conclusion is, that it is not imputed at all.</P>
<P>But yet in affirming nothing, but denying all respects, which reason can conceive in faith, and in roming from himselfe and us, he kicks at us, and by the way snarls and bytes at the truth. For it is most certaine, that faith is said to be imputed in respect of GODS production of it by his spirit, and
<PB N="117" REF="67"/>
in respect of the object <HI>Christ,</HI> and his righteousnes which it doth lay hold on and apply. For the spi∣rit of regenerarion being shed on us through <HI>Christ,</HI> dwelling in us, and making us one body with <HI>Christ,</HI> &amp; partakers of his whole satisfaction, doth worke iusti∣fying faith in us, and this union and conjunction, which in order of nature, goeth before faith and concurres to the production of it, is the ground, and reason, of the imputation of it. If <HI>Christ</HI> were not made ours, and his sa∣tisfaction communicated to us, faith could not truely believe in <HI>Christ,</HI> nor truely apply his righ∣teousnesse, therefore the two last of his negatives are false, and hae∣reticall. Besides, it is not to be passed over in silence, that here a∣gaine he contradicts himselfe, and grants that <HI>Christ,</HI> with his righ∣teousnesse, is the object of faith, and laying hold on him, is the life, and soule of faith; which hee ut∣terly denyeth, and disputes to the
<PB N="118" REF="68"/>
contrary in the next Chapter, as I have touched before.</P>
<P>As for his assumption, the sum whereof is, that faith is imputed, and accepted of GOD, for righte∣ousnesse, upon the same termes, that perfect righteousnes of works should have beene in the first Co∣venant; This is Socinian haeresie, in the highest degree; so grosse, and palpable, and so openly, and expressely affirmed by him, that no salt of interpretation can keepe it from stinking in the nostrills of any true Christian. Here also wee may note his ignorance, ab∣surdity, and nonsense; for instead of shewing in what respect faith is imputed, hee affirmes, that hee holds it to be imputed instead of perfect righteousnesse of our owne workes, and that it is in the new Covenant a condition an∣swerable and every way as sufficient and availeable to procure all favours, rewards, and priviledges, to us from GOD, as the righteousnesse of
<PB N="119" REF="68"/>
workes, was in the Covenant of workes: and both here, and in the conclusion, hee makes faith as me∣ritorious, and as strong a bond to tye GOD, and make him countable for all favours, rewards, and pri∣viledges, under paine of being counted a covenant breaker; as the perfect fulfilling of the Law, by e∣very man in his owne person, was in the covenant of workes, and here doth more then give the right hand of fellowship, to Popish justification, for hee transcends them, and makes GOD more ob∣liged to men for them, and more countable then any Papists ever did. As for the testimonies which hee brings, out of <HI>Ambrose,</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> they are nothing to his pur∣pose; they onely affirme, that as the Law was mans onely guide to salvation, and the rule of righte∣ousnesse in the old covenant; So faith in the Gospel, is the onely way to salvation in the new cove∣nant, and the meanes by which we receive the grace of GOD▪ and
<PB N="120" REF="69"/>
the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> offered to us for justification, and sal∣vation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="Socinian position">
<HEAD>Socinianisme.</HEAD>
<P>SEcondly, when we deny the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes in justification, we neither deny the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> in it selfe, we rather suppose and e∣stablish it, neither 2<SUP>o</SUP> doe wee de∣ny the absolute necessity of it, both to the justification, and salvation of a sinner: neither 3<SUP>o</SUP> do wee deny a meritorious efficiencie, and causalitie in that righteousnes in re∣spect of the justification of a sinner, but verily believe and conceive, that GOD justifieth all that are justified, not simply or barely, for <HI>Christs</HI> sake, or for his righteousnes sake (for a man may doe a thing for his sake whom he much loves, and respects, though he hath not otherwise deserved it at his hands) but for the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> his death being taken into the con∣sideration
<PB N="121" REF="69"/>
with it, why GOD should justifie those that believe in him. But 4<SUP>o</SUP> and lastly, that which we deny in denying the im∣putation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, is this, that GOD should looke up∣on a believing sinner, and account of him, as one that hath done in his owne person, all that <HI>Christ</HI> did in obedience to the morall Law, and hereupon pronounce him righte∣ous: or: (which is the same) that GOD should impute unto him those particular acts of obedience which <HI>Christ</HI> performed in that nature, and property of them, so that hee should stand as righteous before GOD, as <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe, or (which is the same) righteous with the selfe same righteousnesse wherewith <HI>Christ</HI> was righteous, and so GOD make himselfe count∣able to him for such obedience imputed in as great matters of re∣wards as he would have beene for the like obedience personally performed by himselfe; in a word, this is that which we deny, and
<PB N="122" REF="70"/>
this is that which we affirme, con∣cerning the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> in the justification of a sinner, that GOD cloathes none with the letter of it, but every man that believes with the spirit of it. 1. that this righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> is not that, that is imputed unto any man for his righteousnesse; but is that for which righteousnes is imputed to every man that be∣lieveth: a justified person may in such a sense be said to be cloathed with <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, as <HI>Pauls</HI> necessities were relieved, and supplied by his hands. <HI>Act.</HI> 20.24. these hands (saith hee) have ministred to my necessities. <HI>Paul</HI> neither eate his fingers, nor spun out the flesh of his hands, in∣to cloathing, and yet was both fed, and cloathed with them: So may a believer be said to be cloathed with the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> and yet the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> it selfe, not to be his cloa∣thing, but onely that which procu∣reth his cloathing unto him, and so
<PB N="123" REF="70"/>
<HI>Calvin</HI> calls that clothing of righ∣teousnes wherewith the beleever is cloathed in his justification, <HI>Justitiam morte &amp; resurrectione Christi acquisitam,</HI> a righteousnes procured by the death, and resur∣rection of <HI>Christ.</HI> This righte∣ousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> may be said to be the righteousnes of a beleever, in such construction of speech, as the knowledge of GOD and of <HI>Christ,</HI> is said to be eternall life. <HI>Iohn</HI> 17.3. <HI>viz.</HI> in way of causality, not in that formality of it, and againe the righteousnes of a beleever in his justification, may be tearmed the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> in such sense, as the favour of GOD in de∣liverance of a man out of trouble, is called a mans righteousnes. <HI>Iob.</HI> 33. <HI>verse</HI> 26. or as the nation and people of the <HI>Jewes</HI> are often in the <HI>Scriptures</HI> called <HI>Iacob,</HI> they were not <HI>Iacob</HI> in the propriety of his person, but in his descent and propagation; so may the righ∣teousnes of a beleever bee called the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> because
<PB N="124" REF="71"/>
it is a righteousnes descended from it, and issuing as it were out of the loynes of it. What hath been affirmed, and what hath beene de∣nyed in the question, wee come now to prove and demonstrate the truth of both. 1<SUB>o</SUB> From the authority of <HI>Scriptures.</HI> 2<SUB>o</SUB> From the grounds of reason; as for the third way of proofe and confirma∣tion by consent of Authors, we shall not assigne a peculiar place for that by it selfe, but interlace our other proofes occasionally with such testimonies as we have recei∣ved from learned, and judicious men for confirmation of our point to be discussed.</P>

<P>THe second thing in this last part or passage is a profession of his meaning in denying <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to be imputed in ju∣stification.</P>
<P>First because he would have an adversarie for him to triumph o∣ver,
<PB N="125" REF="71"/>
and least his admired sophi∣stry should be idle, for want of an opposite against which it might magnifie it selfe in the eyes of senselesse sectaries; hee suffers <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to have a be∣ing, and doth not deny it in it self, but doth approve and establish it, and so by good hap hee esca∣pes one base absurdity in his dis∣puting, to wit, denying of the subject of the question.</P>
<P>Secondly, because he would have his competitor, or corrivall to be of some great note, the more to glorifie his victory over him, hee doth not deny an absolute necessi∣ty of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes, both to the justification and salvation of sinners; we thanke him, that for saving of himselfe from the ha∣tred and skorne of the world, he would grant so much of truth o∣penly testified in Scripture. Third∣ly he doth not deny a meritorious efficiency, or causality of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse in respect of the ju∣stification of a sinner. In this hee
<PB N="126" REF="72"/>
comes somewhat neere to us, but I doubt it is not in sincerity and truth, but rather in show, to make the ignorant to conceive better, or at least, not to judge so hardly of his opinion, for marke his slub∣bering, and dawbing, with untem∣pered morter, I verily believe (saith hee) that GOD justifieth them that are justified, not simply, or barely, for <HI>Christs</HI> sake, or for his righte∣ousnesse sake, but for the righteous∣nesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> his death being ta∣ken into consideration with it: here you see a plaine contradiction, for <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, his death, being taken into considera∣tion with it, is no more but his perfect righteousnesse, because his active obedience, without his pas∣sive obediēce to death, is no perfect fulfilling of the Law; so that here is a contradiction, even an affirmati∣on, and negation of one, and the same thing, in one continued sen∣tence. The parenthesis also, which hee inserts to trouble the reader, is false, and frivolous, to
<PB N="127" REF="72"/>
wit, (for a man may doe a thing for his sake, whom hee much loves, and respects, though hee hath not otherwise deserved it at his hands.) First let mee aske him what is his drift in these words? It seemes to mee, either to be wholly superfluous, or to intimate that <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes did not deserve our justification at GODS hands, but that GOD out of love and respect to <HI>Christs</HI> per∣son, without the merit of his righ∣teousnesse, doth accept us, and count us righteous. Secondly, let mee tell him, that when a man doth any thing for another out of love, without desert, hee doth it for his owne loves sake, and for the magnifying of his kindnes, and free bounty▪ and thus GOD did in giving his Sonne for us, unde∣serving sinners: But when justice doth stand up in strength and pleades for right, as in the justification of sinners, then a full satisfaction must come between, &amp;

love can no otherwise be rightly, and lawfully shewed, but by mak∣ing a satisfaction, or by apposing one who is sufficient to make satis∣faction, that no evill but good may be done to the party loved, and respected: and thus the case stands in justification of sinners. Third∣ly, though a man out of his cor∣rupt, and carnall love, may doe a thing for his favorite, without de∣sert, or just consideration, yea con∣trary to justice, yet it is not so with GOD, who is no respecter of persons, in matter of justice, and justification: Hee doth never out of his free love decree to doe any thing, but withall, hee decrees, and ordeines a just consideration, why hee should doe it; so that this is a frivolous parenthesis, both false and from the matter.</P>
<P>In the fourth place hee sheweth what hee denies in denying the im∣putation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, <HI>viz.</HI> That GOD lookes upon a believing sinner, and accounts him as one that hath done in his owne
<PB N="129" REF="73"/>
person, all that <HI>Christ</HI> did in obe∣dience to the morall Law, and hereupon pronounceth him righ∣teous, so that he doth stand as righ∣teous before GOD, as <HI>Christ</HI> him∣selfe, because righteous with the same righteousnesse; and so GOD makes himselfe countable to him for such obedience imputed in as great matters of reward, as hee would have beene for the like obe∣dience, particularly performed by himselfe. In this expression of himselfe, here is much calumny, error, and untruth. First he doth calumniate, and slander the true Doctrine of <HI>Christ</HI> professed by us concerning the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse; for no man in his right wits did ever hold that imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnesse to believers, is GODS ac∣counting them to have performed in their owne persons, every act of obedience, which <HI>Christ</HI> perfor∣med to the Law▪ This is a mani∣fest contradiction, fitter for a gid∣dy fancy to imagine, then for any
<PB N="130" REF="74"/>
true Christian to professe. The truth which wee professe is this, that true believers being by that one spirit which workes faith in them, united to <HI>Christ,</HI> and made partakers of his righteousnesse, and believing, and applying by faith to themselves, his satisfacti∣on particularly are accounted tru∣ly righteous before GOD by com∣munion, and imputation, not by legall performance in their owne persons: And though the righte∣ousnesse by which they are justifi∣ed, is the very same which is in <HI>Christ,</HI> and which hee performed, yet it doth not follow, that they thereby are as fully righteous as <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe, for he is originally righteous, by his owne personall righteousnes, as the justifier; they are righteous by communion, and imputation, as justified: And as the hands and feet, and other infe∣rior members, live by the same life, and are sensitive by the same sense which is originally in the heart, and head of the same body;
<PB N="131" REF="74"/>
yet they are not so lively, and sen∣sitive, as the heart and head, but in a competent measure, and propor∣tion, fit for every one of them. So it is in the mysticall body of <HI>Christ,</HI> betweene him the head, and them his believing, and justified members, as I have before touch∣ed. So that here we have an in∣tollerable calumny, and slander, laid upon <HI>GODS</HI> sacred truth, and the true professors of the same. Secondly, he utters a notorious un∣truth when he saith, that to bee righteous by the same righteousnes which <HI>Christ</HI> performed, is no∣thing else, but to be performers of every act of his obedience in our persons. Thirdly, it is a wicked error to thinke (as hee doth) that obedience and righteousnes, ether performed by ourselves or com∣municated to us, should make <HI>GOD</HI> countable to us▪ that is, bound to give us the greatest re∣wards. For the righteousnes of justification and the holynes, and obedience of sanctification, are
<PB N="132" REF="75"/>
onely free gifts which GOD gives to make us capable of eternall life, and fit to stand in his presence, and to see and enjoy his glory; not bands to tye himselfe, and to make him countable to us; for if we be righteous what give we to him, or what receiveth he at our hands? <HI>Iob</HI> 35.7. eternall life, though by <HI>Christ</HI> purchased for us; yet is the free gift of GOD in <HI>Christ. Rom.</HI> 6.23. Here therefore this sublimate Doc∣tor doth bewray his owne igno∣rance in the maine mysteries of salvation, and is as <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 14. become filthy, stinking, and abominable in his thoughts, and imaginations, concerning GOD himselfe, while hee doateth after Socinian subtilties, and sets himselfe to be singular, by preach∣ing his fond errors, and heresies. Lastly, after all this, in conclusion, hee takes upon him to elude, and evacuate those most plaine testi∣monies of holy <HI>Scripture,</HI> wherein <HI>Christ</HI> is sayd to cloath, and cover us with the garments of salvation,
<PB N="133" REF="75"/>
and the robe of his righteousnesse <HI>Isa</HI> 61.10. that our sinnes and staines, being thereby covered, <HI>Psal.</HI> 32.1. sinne might no more be imputed to us; but we in the robes of his righteousnesse may stand cloathed as with long white linnen robes, <HI>Revel.</HI> 19.8. And like <HI>Iacob</HI> in the garments of the first borne, yeelding a sweet smel∣ling savour, may be accepted of GOD our heavenly father. First hee saith, that GOD in the justifi∣cation of sinners, cloathes none with the letter of <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnesse, but every man that be∣lieves with the Spirit of it: that is, not with the righteousnesse it self, but with the fruite and benefit of it: that is, with faith counted for righteousnesse, where note, that (in his conceipt,) the righteous∣nesse of a justified man, is a thing inhaerent in himselfe, and a worke performed in his owne person, not communicated to him from ano∣ther, <HI>ab extra,</HI> as garments are, and so no cloathing: here is one grosse
<PB N="134" REF="76"/>
absurdity, like as if one should say, a mans cloathes are not on him, but in him. That speech of <HI>Paul, these hands have ministred to my necessitie, Act</HI> 20.34. are nothing to the purpose, for he doth not say his hands were his necessary meat, and cloathes, but by working did get him necessaries; and so <HI>Christ</HI> by his obedience procured righte∣ousnesse for us, which he doth communicate to us, and cloathes us with, and by GOD it is imputed to us: and this <HI>Calvin</HI> calles righte∣ousnesse gotten by <HI>Christs</HI> death and resurrection: and all this is for us, and against himselfe.</P>
<P>The other instances which hee brings from <HI>Scripture</HI> to prove that <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse is by a me∣tonymie of the cause for the effect, used to signifie the fruite and effect of it in us, prove no such thing at all. The first of them <HI>Iohn</HI> 17.3. <HI>(this is eternall life, to know thee the onely true GOD, &amp;c.</HI> It is mis∣taken, for to know GOD, and <HI>Christ</HI> (that is, to have experimentall
<PB N="135" REF="76"/>
knowledge of GOD, and <HI>Christ,</HI> and to enjoy GOD in <HI>Christ,</HI> as the word (know) by an Hebraisme signifies) is not there mentioned, as the efficient cause of eternall life, but as the thing wherein it doth formally consist: So also that speech, <HI>Iob</HI> 33, 26. (as Master <HI>Perkins</HI> truely expounds it) doth not speake of the fruite of a mans righteousnesse, which GOD ren∣ders to him; but of the righteous∣nesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> which GOD ren∣ders to a man a fresh, and after temptation, doubting, and distresse, makes him feele and enioy it in himselfe, when by repentance, and humble and faithfull prayer hee seekes it.</P>
<P>And although the nation of the Israelites are often (as hee alledg∣eth) called by the name of Jacob in <HI>Scripture,</HI> because he was their Father, and they his naturall pro∣geny: yet this proves onely, that the <HI>Scripture</HI> useth tropes of speech many times, which we acknow∣ledge willingly, and in the next
<PB N="136" REF="77"/>
Chapter will prove fully. Where hee forgetting, and contradicting himselfe, utterly disclaimes tropes and figures, and exclaimes against all the learned, who hold that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> useth a trope in saying that faith is imputed for righteous∣nesse: Well, for the present wee will grant him, that our cleannesse from the guilt of sinne, and the state of righteous, and justified persons, wherein we stand before GOD, being the issue and fruite of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction communicated to us, may very well be called by a trope the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI>; but this doth not overthrow, but rather strongly prove the commu∣nion, and imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to us. Thus we see how hee labours in the fire, and in vaine beats his braines, and out of the confusion, and distemper of them, doth say, and gainsay, af∣firme and deny the same things of∣tentimes; being like a clowd without water, carried about with winds, sometimes one way,
<PB N="137" REF="77"/>
and againe the contrary way, and never settling upon solid truth, nor building upon a sure foundation. Now what he promiseth in the conclusion of this Chapter▪ you shall see how hee performeth by my answer, to his second Chapter, wherein as he begins here, so he goeth on entangling and beating himselfe, forging and falsifying, and in every passage discovering his ignorance and folly, mingled with much impudency &amp; hereticall perversenesse and pravity, which that it may better appeare, and that we may see his <HI>Socinian</HI> here∣sie to the bottome clearely, I will lay downe the chiefe heads of the Doctrine of Justification, as it is taught in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and main∣tained by all Orthodox Divines, both ancient and moderne.</P>
<P>Justification taken in a full sense is that act of GOD, by which he justifies his elect, and faithfull in his son <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> by the com∣munion of his spirit; that is, doth make them righteous by <HI>Christs</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="78"/>
perfect righteousnes, and full sa∣tisfaction spiritually made theirs, and doth count them righteous by imputing the same unto them, and doth declare them to be righ∣teous inwardly to their owne consciences by the inward testi∣mony of his spirit, and the inward sense and experience of inward grace; and outwardly in this life before men, and publiquely in the last judgements by their good workes, which are evidences of their faith, and of their union and communion with <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> and of their regeneration by his spirit, and adoption unto GOD in him.</P>
<P>First GOD the father is the pri∣mary efficient cause of our justifi∣cation. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.26.30. and 4.5. and 8.33. Secondly the inward moving cause is GODS owne free grace favour and love <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.7.

<P>The materiall cause, that is, the righteousnesse it selfe by which they are justified, that is, made, counted, and declared to be righ∣teous, is <HI>Christs</HI> perfect righteous∣nes obedience and satisfaction, which he, GOD and man perform∣ed in our nature, in the state of hu∣miliation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24.25. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. and 8.4. The formall cause of justification is that com∣munion between <HI>Christ</HI> and us,
<PB N="140" REF="79"/>
and that reciprocall imputation of our sinnes to <HI>Christ,</HI> and of his righteousnes, and full satisfaction to us, which communion ariseth, and floweth from the spirit which GOD sheds on us through <HI>Christ,</HI> which spirit dwelling in us (in some measure, so as he dwelleth in the man <HI>Christ,</HI> from whom hee is derived to us) doth make us one spirituall body with <HI>Christ,</HI> and works in us faith and all holy gra∣ces, &amp; affections by which we ad∣here and cleave to <HI>Christ,</HI> and ap∣ply and inioy his righteousnes, so that it is our formall righteousnes not inherently, but imputatively, and by spirituall communion, for it is that which doth constitute, and make us righteous, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17, 18, 19. and 8.4. and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.4. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21.</P>
<P>The immediate fruit and bene∣fit of our iustification, is the state of righteousnes and of cleanenesse from the guilt of sinne, and accep∣tation with GOD, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25. and 4.2. also peace with GOD, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="79"/>The end and use of our iusti∣fication is the satisfaction and de∣claration <MILESTONE N="1"/> of GODS iustice, in that he iustifieth us by the full satisfa∣ction of <HI>Christ,</HI> and not otherwise, neither by it till he communicates it to us and makes it ours; Also the manifestation of his mercy, free grace and bounty, in that he would give his sonne to become man, and to make satisfaction to the full, when no other could bee found able to satisfie for us, neither could his iustice by any other meanes be satisfied, also in that hee would give us his spirit to unite us to his sonne, and to bring us to a true communion of his righteousnes, and to worke faith in us by which we receive and enioy <HI>Christ</HI> with all his benefits, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24.26. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.4. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.6.12.</P>

<HEAD>The contrary Doctrine of <HI>Soci∣nus</HI>▪ and his faction.</HEAD>
<P>THough they grant that GOD is the chiefe efficient cause,
<PB N="142" REF="80"/>
and his free grace, mercy, and love, the inward moving cause; yet they erre in the impulsive and in∣strumentall cause, and make <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteousnes no otherwise meritorious, but by procuring that GOD should count faith in a pro∣per sense, for righteousnes to them that beleeve, neither any other way an instrument of iustification, but by bringing faith to this honour, to be accepted for, or in stead of righte∣ousnes.</P>
<P>Secondly they deny all causality of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes in justifica∣tion, except onely by way of ef∣ficiency: whereas indeed and in truth it is the matter about which justification is exercised, for what is justification but the communi∣cating of that righteousnes to men, and the imputing of it, and declaring of them to be thereby righteous? the very name of justi∣fication signifies so much: and what is the forme of a justified man as he is righteous, but righte∣ousnes? to imagine a righteous,
<PB N="143" REF="80"/>
and justified man without righte∣ousnes, is as if one should dreame of a living man without life or soule.</P>
<P>Thirdly they deny the princi∣pall ground of justification, to wit, spirituall union and communion with <HI>Christ,</HI> which cannot stand without imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes; for communion and union doe necessarily bring with them imputation. If wee have communion of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction and righteousnesse, GOD must needs judge and count them to be ours, for his judgement is accor∣ding to truth. And faith which is an inferiour and subordinate meanes, they set up in the place of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes.</P>
<P>Fourthly as they deny the ma∣teriall cause of iustification, by re∣iecting <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes from being the proper matter about which it is exercised; so also the forme or formall cause, even the mutuall communion, and recipro∣call imputation of our sinnes to
<PB N="144" REF="81"/>
<HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction and righteousnes to us, whereby it is made our formall righteous∣nes not inherently, but spiritual∣ly and imputatively, for they ac∣knowledge no formality, but inhe∣rency.</P>
<P>Fiftly they deny the immediate fruit and benefit of justification, to wit that state of righteousnes, cleannesse from the guilt of sinne, and acceptation with GOD, wherein the justified are firme∣ly established before GOD, and stand in his sight, which is the chiefe honour and prerogative of GODS Saints, and their greatest comfort in all their afflictions, and temptations.</P>
<P>Lastly, they take away the true end, and use of justification, to wit, the revelation of GODS infinite justice, mercy, bounty, and free grace; for they overthrow his infinite justice, while they teach that GOD by his soveraign power puts his justice to silence; and without <HI>Christs</HI> full satisfaction,
<PB N="145" REF="81"/>
made to it, for us, and made ours by communion, and imputation, doth accept our weake faith in stead of it, and makes himselfe as countable for it in all rewardes, as hee would doe for the perfect ful∣filling of the Law by our selves, or by <HI>Christ</HI> in our stead. They ex∣tenuate and vilifie GODS mercy, bounty, and free grace; by set∣ting up faith in stead of <HI>Christs</HI> perfect righteousnes, and making it the condition of the new cove∣nant. For whatsoever is given or promised to us, upon a condition to be on our part performed, is not a gift of free grace and boun∣ty. And when justice may bee turned out of doores, without a compleat satisfaction; there is nothing left for mercy wherein to shew the power of it. The infi∣nite mercy of GOD doth appeare in this, that, when his infinite iu∣stice required that wee should all be damned without a full satisfa∣ction (which none could make but the sonne of GOD in our na∣ture)
<PB N="146" REF="82"/>
and that performed for us, and made ours; Hee would give his onely sonne for us to satisfie in our stead, and his holy spirit to unite us to his Sonne, and to bring us to communion of his satisfa∣ction.</P>
<P>Thus wee see that they shut up the doore of Heaven, and stop that onely way to eternall life, by o∣verthrowing justification, which is the making and accounting of men righteous, by that onely righ∣teousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> besides which there is not any other to be found sufficient, and able to beare us out before GODS tribunall of ju∣stice. Now let all true Christians well weigh and consider the diffe∣rence, betweene truth and errour, life and death, true Christianity and Antichristian infidelity; for such is the damned <HI>Socinianisme</HI> before discovered. And if any man in the midst of the light of the Gospell shining so clearely, and discovering so plainely cursed he∣resie, will be blind; let him bee

<PB N="150" REF="84"/>
off from the approbation of many, and sometimes, even of those, that are greatest pretenders to the truth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The Answere.</HEAD>
<P>THe first part or speech, is a solid truth, to wit, that no wisdome, and learning under hea∣ven, is so fit or able to determine what is imputed, for righteousnes in justification, as the holy Ghost speaking in the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> But this truth he contradicts in the next words which follow imme∣diately, where he saith, that the holy Ghost leaues his meaning, and intent to men to debate, which if it be true, then men are to deter∣mine, and to take up every diffe∣rence about any subject in Religi∣on. This beginning with contra∣diction is very ominous, and pro∣digious: and from hence we may gather, what we are likely to find in his ensuing discourse.</P>
<P>The rule by which men are to judge of, the Spirits meaning is the
<PB N="151" REF="84"/>
stamp, and superscription of ratio∣nall authority, set upon them: so hee here expressely affirmes, and in this hee openly professeth himselfe, to be of the faction of the <HI>Socinian,</HI> and <HI>Arminian</HI> remon∣strants, who doe teach that the best judge of the meaning, of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> is, <HI>recta ratio,</HI> that is, their owne carnall reason, rectifi∣ed by the art of Sophistrie. Againe, hee affirmes, that all the Christian world knowes, or readily may know, what the holy Ghost speaks in the <HI>Scripture.</HI> If this be true, then they are all taught of GOD, and the Spirit leaues not his mean∣ing to men to debate, and to pro∣mise betweene controverters. Here is another contradiction.</P>
<P>Hee proceeds yet further in his absurdities, and tells us that the holy Ghost reveales not to all the Christian world, but to some, the secret of his counsell, the Spirit of his letter: this is a contradiction to that which went next before. And whereas before hee saith, that
<PB N="152" REF="85"/>
all the Christian world knowes what the holy Ghost speakes in <HI>Scripture,</HI> that is all saving truth: here hee saith, that hee reveales the secret of his counsell, but in some particulars: thus in every thing he contradicts himselfe, and like a lunatick broken out of Bedlam, he raves, first saying, and affirming, and immediately denying, and gainesaying, in the same things. But yet a lunatick persons have high conceits of themselves, that they are of noble, and royall blood, right heires to Crownes, King∣doms, and Empires: or if not the holy Ghost himselfe, yet persons wonderfully illuminated, and in∣spired by him. And many times they will not utter their conceits in expresse words, but tell you of such great persons, and complaine of your blockish dulnesse, and stu∣pidity, if you doe not presently dis∣cerne that they speake of them∣selves, and they are the men. So here doth this illuminated Doctor deale with us: He tells us of some
<PB N="153" REF="85"/>
speciall ones, to whom the Spirit interprets in the eare, and reveales the secret of his councell, the Spirit of his letter, who are the true be∣gotten of the truth: and that hee takes himself to be a chiefe among these, it appeares, first by his under∣taking to give a reason of the counsell and purpose of GOD in his former Chapter, (as I have there noted.) Secondly, by his taking upon him, here to determine this question, which none but such illu∣minated ones can be able to do. And hee breakes off his prologue with a kind of complaint, and ex∣probration full of disdaine, namely this, that because they, (meaning himselfe, and his fellowes) are not marked in the forehead, by the Spirit of illumination; therefore their thoughts, and apprehensions, are yet in common esteeme like o∣ther men (you see, <HI>non sapit huma∣num, nec est mortale quod optat</HI>) till some stamp, and superscription, of rationall authority, be set upon them to make the difference. Here
<PB N="154" REF="86"/>
hee seemes in this last clause, to take courage, and to conceive some hope, that by the rational authori∣ty, of his new coined Logick, (of which he lately gave us a tast, whē he told us, that causes are opposit, <HI>ex diametro</HI> &amp; therefore the effici∣ent, impulsive instrumentall ma∣teriall, formall, and finall causes, of mans justification, and salvation, cannot all, or the most of them con∣curre in one person <HI>Christ,</HI> though GOD and man) hee will make the difference knowne betweene his excellency, and other mens igno∣bility, and obscurity.</P>
<P>The last clause of his complaint, wherewith hee concludes his Pre∣face, is an overthwart blow to some, where speaking of those first begotten of the truth, he saith, yea many times the nearer the truth, the further off from the ap∣probation of many; and some∣times even of those, that are the greatest pretenders to the truth. A shrewd nip (if you marke it) to you learned Doctors, &amp; Preach∣ers
<PB N="155" REF="86"/>
of the Citie of <HI>London,</HI> who are great pretenders to the truth: and yet the nearer that hee is come to the truth, and makes his unlear∣ned followers able to see it to the bottom (as he hath often told us) the further off hee is from your ap∣probation. If hee be thus bold, and ready to nip you who doe not approve his opinion, it is no mar∣vaile that his rude followers, doe lay all slaunders, reproach, and as∣persions on us, who oppose him, and charge him with Socinian hae∣resie, and blasphemy, whom they admire, and proclaime to bee the great light of GODS Church in these last dayes.</P>

<HI>Scriptures,</HI> sufficient to prove the innocency of an assertion which is agreeable to that interpretati∣on, is a question, many interpre∣tations seeme to have all these, and yet are contradicted by other <HI>Scriptures,</HI> as that place <HI>Hosea</HI> 11.1. When <HI>Israel</HI> was a child, out of <HI>Egypt</HI> have I called my Sonne, being interpreted of the Nation of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> was borne up by the letter, concurred with the scope, and circumstances more then ma∣ny contrary expositors, and all the learned and able <HI>Jewes</HI> so un∣derstood it: and yet the Gospell ex∣pounds it another way, <HI>Mat.</HI> 2.15. The place of Scripture upon the interpretation whereof establish∣ed by these foure things, hee in∣tends to build his whole dispute in this Chapter, is the fourth Chapter of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>; so that his proofes by which hee goeth about to set the royall Crowne, which is due to <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteousnes, on the head of mans imperfect faith, are ac∣cording
<PB N="159" REF="88"/>
to these foure things, di∣vided into foure rankes. First he undertakes to prove, that the Letter of that <HI>Scripture, Rom.</HI> 4. doth beare up his interpretation, to wit, that faith in it selfe, and in a proper sense is said to bee impu∣ted for righteousnes in justificati∣on. Secondly by the scope of the place. Thirdly by shewing that the circumstances of that <HI>Scripture,</HI> cannot beare the Doctrine of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes imputed. Fourthly by the judgement, and testimonies of able learned and un∣partiall men. But how poorely he performes his undertakings, and how pitifully hee faileth in them, wee shall in the progresse shew. That his disputation is like to be very Illogicall, we may ga∣ther from the foule flaw which ap∣peares in his Logicke, in this his first enterance, where hee saith wee need no more Scriptures, to prove the innocency of our affir∣mative, <HI>viz.</HI> the imputation of faith for righteousnes (the truth
<PB N="160" REF="89"/>
of the negative inseparably ac∣companying it) but that Chapter onely, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>First it is against all true reason and Logicke, that the affirmative should be innocent from untruth, and that the negative which is opposed to it, should have truth accompanying it. If his affirma∣tive (faith is imputed for righte∣ousnesse, in a proper sense) be true, then the negative must needs be false, to wit, faith in a proper sense is not imputed: But perhaps by the negative, he doth not meane the negative of his affirmative, but some other negative proposi∣tion, the subject whereof, is diffe∣rent from the subject of his affir∣mative. His hatred and envy, a∣gainst <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, least it should get the Crowne from faith, is so great, that wee may well conceive, that by the nega∣tive hee in heart meanes, this (<HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes is not impu∣ted in justification) which if hee doth, wee cannot but blame him
<PB N="161" REF="89"/>
for speaking ambiguously, which Logick in a disputation abhorreth. But I leave his trifling, and come to the ground and foundation of his discourse, even that fourth Chapter of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> on which he labours to build his hereticall opinion. The words of that Chapter which seeme most to favour him are these. <HI>Verse</HI> 3. <HI>Abraham</HI> beleeved GOD, and it was counted to him for righte∣ousnes, and <HI>verse</HI> 5. To him that beleeveth, his faith is counted for righteousnes, and <HI>verse</HI> 9. For we say that faith was reckoned to <HI>Abraham</HI> for righte∣ousnes.</P>
<P>That the truth may more plain∣ly appeare, and the contrary fals∣hoode, and errour be made more fully manifest, I will first lay down the true orthodoxe exposition of the words, which is according to the common judgement of the most godly, learned, and judicious Divines, of the best reformed Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="90"/>Secondly I will truely rehearse the corrupt exposition of the <HI>Apo∣stles</HI> wordes, made by the here∣ticke <HI>Socinus,</HI> and his followers the <HI>Arminians,</HI> and other fanati∣call Sectaries, unto which this adversary adheres, and grounds his whole disputation upon it. The orthodox exposition I will illu∣strate and confirme by the scope, and circumstances of the rext, and by arguments drawne from other <HI>Scriptures.</HI> The corrupt expositi∣on also I will prove to be false, and hereticall. And afterwards I will proceed to answer this adversa∣ries discourse in every particular.</P>

<HEAD>The true Exposition explained.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst these wordes, that <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> beleeved GOD, and it was counted to him for righteousnes, are generally held to be improper, and tropicall, and that the mean∣ing of them is not, that <HI>Abrahams</HI> faith, or act of beleeving by it
<PB N="163" REF="90"/>
selfe in a proper sense, was counted to him for righteousnes: but that the object of his faith even that which he beleeved, to wit, <HI>Christ</HI> promised for righteousnes and sal∣vation, was that which by GOD was (upon <HI>Abrahams</HI> beleeving) counted to him for righteousnes. It was not his faith simply consi∣dered in it selfe, but his faith em∣bracing <HI>Christ</HI> promised, and possessing him with his righte∣ousnes, and satisfaction which was reckned to him for righteous∣nes, and as to him, so to every one that beleeveth his faith is counted to him for righteousnes. For all true beleevers who by faith lay hold on <HI>Christ,</HI> the promised seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and beleeve GOD to be their shield, and ex∣ceeding great reward in him, they are by one spirit baptised into one spirituall body with <HI>Christ,</HI> united to him their spirituall head, and made his lively members, and sen∣sible partakers of his perfect obe∣dience, righteousnes and full satis∣faction,
<PB N="164" REF="91"/>
for redemption, remis∣sion of sinnes, justification, and perfect salvation; and need not any more to seeke the reward of blessednes, by the righteousnes of their owne workes▪ performed ac∣cording to the tenour of the Law, by every man in his owne person; but in the LORD <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> (who is <HI>Iehovah Zid-kenu</HI> the LORD our righteousnes, <HI>Ier.</HI> 23.6. and the end and fulfilling of the Law for righteousnes to every one that beleeveth, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.4.) they have perfect righteousnes. And in him GOD is become their re∣ward, and the lot and portion of their inheritance, <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.5. And that gracious and free favour which GOD shewed to <HI>Abraham,</HI> when hee beleeved in <HI>Christ</HI> pro∣mised, and firmely without stag∣gering applyed to himselfe, the blessing promised, being fully per∣swaded that GOD who of his free grace promised, was by his pow∣er able to performe, though by the course of nature, and by rea∣son
<PB N="165" REF="91"/>
of the deadnesse of <HI>Sara's</HI> wombe he himselfe seemed to bee, and indeed was uncapable of that blessing; The same hee will shew to all true beleevers, who are <HI>A∣brahams</HI> faithfull seed, and chil∣dren of promise, that is, as hee reckoned <HI>Abrahams</HI> faith for righteousnes; so hee will count their faith to them for righteous∣nes; that is, he will accept and ac∣count them for righteous persons (as indeed they are) not for any workes of their owne, nor by any righteousnesse performed ac∣cording to the letter of the law in their owne persons, but by the righteousnes, which is through the faith of <HI>Christ,</HI> and is called the righteousnes of faith, because it is the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> GOD and man, given to them of GOD, and of them apprehended, and applyed by faith. For being thus justified by faith, and having communion with <HI>Christ</HI> of his full satisfaction and righteousnes, GOD whose judgement is accor∣ding
<PB N="166" REF="92"/>
to truth doth certainely judge and count them (as truly they are) righteous in his sight, &amp; becomes in <HI>Christ</HI> their shield, and exceed∣ing great reward. This is the Orthodox exposition of the <HI>Apo∣stles</HI> wordes in this Chapter, ge∣nerally received by all, both anci∣ent and moderne Divines, famous for learning and godlinesse.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="exposition">
<HEAD>The corrupt and hereticall expo∣sition of the <HI>Apostles</HI> words, made by <HI>Socinus,</HI> and main∣tained by his followers the Ar∣minians, and other fanaticall Sectaries.</HEAD>
<P>THey of the <HI>Socinian</HI> faction, doe generally hold and obsti∣nately affirme, that <HI>Abrahams</HI> be∣leeving and his faith, taken in a proper literall sense without any trope, is here said by the <HI>Apostle</HI> to be counted to <HI>Abraham</HI> for righ∣teousnes, in stead of all righteous∣nes which either <HI>Abraham</HI> him∣selfe,
<PB N="167" REF="92"/>
was by the Law bound to performe in his owne person, or any surety could performe for him. And in like manner to eve∣ry one that beleeveth, his faith is in a proper sense said to bee counted for righteousnes, even his faith by it selfe, and not the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> with it. This is their exposition. And up∣on these wordes of the <HI>Apostle</HI> thus falsly, and corruptly inter∣preted, they build all their here∣ticall opinions, and doctrines con∣cerning justification of the faith∣full before GOD, namely these following. First that faith, as it is in every beleever, even as it is inherent in him, and is his owne faith and beleeving; is the onely thing which GOD of his grace and mercy, and out of his absolute so∣veraigne power and dominion, is pleased to ordaine, appoint, and account for all the righteousnes, which a man shall have for his ju∣stification; though in truth, and according to Law and the rule of
<PB N="168" REF="93"/>
justice, it is not righteousnes, being weak oftentimes and full of imperfections.</P>
<P>Secondly that the Spirit of GOD <MILESTONE N="2"/> in these wordes of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> did not intend or meane any com∣munion of the righteousnes, and perfect obedience performed by <HI>Christ</HI> to the Law, as our surety, and in our stead, nor imputation of that righteousnes to every true beleever for justification, nor GODS accepting of the faithfull for righteous by that righteous∣nes communicated to them, and of them applyed possessed and en∣joyed by faith.</P>
<P>By faith, and believing, they do <MILESTONE N="3"/> not understand that applying faith, which is a gift and worke of GODS Spirit, in the elect, rege∣nerate, and sanctified, by which they do believe and are perswa∣ded, that they are in <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> is their head, and they as lively members of his mysticall bo∣dy▪ have communion of all his be∣nefits, even of his full satisfaction
<PB N="169" REF="93"/>
and perfect righteousnes, for justi∣fication, and full remission of all their sinnes. But by faith, and believing, they understand onely a confidence in GOD, that hee will performe his promises made in <HI>Christ,</HI> and an assent unto his word that it is true. The tenour of which word, and promises, they con∣ceive to be this; That <HI>Christ</HI> in his pure unspotted humane nature, hath by his righteousnesse, suffe∣ring and obedience, unto death, meritted, such high favour with GOD; that GOD in honour to him is pleased to accept and ac∣count the faith of them that be∣lieve in him, and rest on him for their Saviour, for perfect righte∣ousnesse, and requires no other righteousnesse to constitute, and make them in any sort formally righteous in their justification.</P>
<P>When they acknowledge that the perfect righteousnesse, and sa∣tisfaction <MILESTONE N="4"/> of <HI>Christ,</HI> is the merito∣rious cause of our justification: they do not meane that they are
<PB N="170" REF="94"/>
communicated to us, and so appre∣hended, and possessed of us by faith, that we are thereby indeed, and in GODS account righteous be∣fore GOD, and justified; or that they deserve and are worthy, that GOD should so account us for them. But their mind, and mean∣ing is, that <HI>Christ</HI> by his righte∣ousnesse hath merited, that GOD for his sake, and in favour to him should account faith to us for righ∣teousnesse, without either our owne workes, of the Law, or <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse imputed to us and made ours by com∣munion. And when they say that faith is imputed for righte∣ousnes as an instrument, they doe not meane as the instrument or spirituall hand, applying <HI>Christ</HI> his righteousnes to bee after a sort, the formall righteousnesse of the believer, but that faith, as it is the instrument by which the be∣liever doth believe that <HI>Christ</HI> hath purchased this favour, that his believing should be the only thing,
<PB N="171" REF="94"/>
accounted to him for righteousnes; so onely and no other way, GOD reckons to him for righteousnes.</P>
<P>The orthodox exposition I will in the first place prove, and con∣firme, frō the words of the <HI>Apostle</HI> himself, &amp; by other strong reasons▪ &amp; afterward confute &amp; overthrow the Socinian, hereticall exposition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="exposition">
<HEAD>The true Exposition proved and confirmed.</HEAD>
<P>FOr the right understanding of the <HI>Apostles</HI> wordes, three things come first to be considered, and explained. 1. What is here meant by faith, and believing. 2. What righteousnes is here meant. 3. What is meant by imputation.</P>
<P>First, by faith in this text, wee must not understand, that naturall habit and power, which is com∣mon to all reasonable men; who upon their apprehension, and knowledge of things spoken, and promised, do give willing assent unto them that they are true, ei∣ther for the authority of the spea∣ker whom they doe respect and judge to bee faithfull, or because they see good reason in the things
<PB N="172" REF="95"/>
spoken and promised: And if the things spoken and promised bee such as tend to their owne good; they rest upon them confidently, and perswade themselvs, that they are sure and certaine of them alrea∣dy, or shall receive and enjoy them in due time without faile. But here by faith we are to understand that supernaturall gift, and grace of beleeving wrought in the elect, regenerate by the spirit shed on them abundantly through <HI>Iesus Christ, Tit.</HI> 3.6. which is there∣fore called most holy faith, <HI>Iud.</HI> 20. <HI>verse.</HI> This faith agreeth with the other in foure points. First as that is an habit and power of beleeving, so is this. Secondly as that containes in it, <HI>notitiā in in∣tellectu,</HI> and <HI>assensum in voluntate,</HI> that is, both a notice and know∣ledge of the things spoken and be∣leeved, and an assent of the will, so doth this also. Thirdly as that faith when it goeth no further then knowledge and assent is called hlstoricall; so this also. Fourth∣ly
<PB N="173" REF="95"/>
as that faith when it reacheth to good things promised to our selves particularly, to apply them, and to rest on them, hath also <HI>fiduciam in corde et affectionibus,</HI> a trust and confidence of the heart and affections in it; so hath this also, and is called a firme perswa∣sion, trust and confidence. But they differ in divers things. First that is a naturall power or ha∣bit, this is a spiritual wrought in men by the spirit of GOD dwel∣ing in them, and uniting them to <HI>Christ</HI> in one mysticall body. Se∣condly, that hath in it no know∣ledge, but naturall, arising from light of naturall reason, nor any as∣sent of the will, or confidence in the heart and affections, but such as are drawne, stirred up and wrought by meanes of naturall light, and common causes. This hath in it a spirituall knowledge a∣rising from the spirit of GOD, in∣lightning the understanding; the spirit also inclines and moves the will to give assent, and confirmes
<PB N="174" REF="96"/>
the heart with confidence, and firme perswasion. Thirdly that is common to all reasonable men; This is proper to the elect rege∣nerate and sanctified by the holy Ghost, shed on them through <HI>Christ,</HI> and is the first and as it were the radicall grace and vertue of renovation. Fourthly that hath for the object or things beleeved, either naturall and worldly things onely; or things heavenly and supernaturall, seene, and discerned through the dimme mist of natu∣rall reason, and assented to and re∣sted on with a carnall and unsancti∣fied will and heart. This hath for the object things supernaturall, heavenly and spirituall, discerned by supernaturall light, assented to with an holy and sanctified will, confirmed to the heart by a spiri∣tuall sense, and sweet taste of the things promised, wrought by the holy spirit in the true beleever ap∣prehending and applying them.</P>
<P>But to come nearer to the text, the believing which the <HI>Apostle</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="96"/>
speakes of in 3.9. and 22. verses, is the faith and believing of <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> who divers yeares before this act of believing, which it here said to be counted to him for righ∣teousnesse, was called out of his owne country, and by faith obey∣ed GOD calling, and went and so∣iourned in the land, promised to him, and his seed, as appeares, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.8, 9. He had overcome and slaughtered foure mighty Kings, and their victorious armies, by faith and confidence in GODS promises. And <HI>Melchizedek,</HI> King of <HI>Salem,</HI> the Priest of the most high GOD, had blessed him, as we read, <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. And after these things, the LORD appeared to him, and sayd, feare not <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>▪ I am thy shield, and thy ex∣ceeding great reward; and with∣all hee renued the promise of the blessed seed, by meanes of which seed, all the families of the earth should be blessed in <HI>Abraham,</HI> and should become his faithfull Chil∣dren; besides, his naturall seed,
<PB N="176" REF="97"/>
and posterity, which should come of the Son, and heire of his owne bowels, as appeares, <HI>Gen.</HI> 15. <HI>verse</HI> 1.4. These were the promises which GOD made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and which <HI>Abraham</HI> believed to be true, and resting upon the LORD by firme faith, and beliefe, for the performance of them, the <HI>LORD</HI> counted it to him for righ∣teousnesse. <HI>Gen.</HI> 15.6. or as the <HI>Apostle</HI> expresseth the same sen∣tence, in the same sense, though in words somewhat different, it was counted to him for righteousnesse. <HI>verse</HI> 3. even faith was reckoned to him for righteousnes, <HI>verse</HI> 9. Now this faith was first an holy and spiritual beliefe, and the faith of a man, long before called of GOD, sanctified by his Spirit, and made obedient to GOD and his word. Secondly, it was a beliefe not onely of the promise of <HI>Christ</HI> the blessed seed in generall, but more specially, that <HI>Christ</HI> the blessed seed, should according to the flesh come out of his owne
<PB N="177" REF="97"/>
bowels, and that by <HI>Christ</HI> the Son of GOD, made man of his seed, the redemption both of him, and of his faithfull seed, all true be∣lievers should be wrought, and performed, GODS wrath appea∣sed, the Law fulfilled, and justice satisfied, and perfect righteousnes brought in for their justification; and by his, and their union with <HI>Christ</HI> by one spirit, and commu∣nion of all his benefits, they should have GOD for their portion, and reward, and for their shield and de∣fence, and should not need to seeke the blessing and reward from their owne workes, or their righ∣teousnesse, and fulfilling of the Law in their owne persons, but merely from the free grace of GOD, and of his free gift in <HI>Christ</HI> as a reward of <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nesse, freely given to them, and of them apprehended by faith, and believing. Thirdly, this faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> was not a weake, but strong faith and beliefe, without staggering, even a full perswasion
<PB N="178" REF="98"/>
that GOD who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not, as if they were, was able to make good, and to per∣forme what hee had promised, yea, it was a believing in hope, against hope, that <HI>GOD</HI> could out of a dead body, and womb raise up a lively seed, and make them spiri∣ritually righteous, which are by nature, and according to the Law wicked sinners. All these things are manif<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st by the place before ci∣ted. <HI>Gen</HI> 15. and by the expresse words of the <HI>Apostle</HI> in this Chap∣ter, from the tenth verse, to the end of the Chapter. And thus it is plaine what is meant by faith, which is here said to be impu∣ted for righteousnesse.</P>
<P>Secondly, the righteousnesse here meant, is not the righteousnes which is according to the strict termes, and tenour of the Law, that is, righteousnes of a mans own workes, performed by every man in his owne person to the whole
<PB N="179" REF="98"/>
Law of GOD, for the <HI>Apostle</HI> doth dispute altogether against that righteousnes, and proves that nei∣ther <HI>Abraham</HI> was justified, or counted of <HI>GOD</HI> righteous for it, as appeares in the 2.5.6. and 13. verses; nor any other at any time, as he shewes in the Chapter next before, and in the Chap. 8.3. and 9.32. and 10.3. But here is meant an Evangelical righteousnes which doth not consist in any worke, or workes performed by man himselfe in his owne person, nor in any grace or vertue, inhae∣rent in himselfe, but is a righteous∣nes which <HI>GOD</HI> of his owne free grace, doth impute to the true be∣liever, who by one spirit is united to <HI>Christ,</HI> and hath communion with him, and which is called the righteousnes of faith, (because by faith men lay hold on it) and doth exclude legal justification by righ∣teousnes of a mans owne workes▪ as appeares by the <HI>Apostles</HI> whole discourse in this and the former Chapter, and in divers other pla∣ces
<PB N="180" REF="99"/>
of this Epistle, especially verse 13, of this Chapter, and in Chap. 3.27.28.</P>
<P>Thirdly the phrase of imputing or counting a thing to one, signi∣fies both in the old and new Testa∣ment, an act of judgment and esti∣mation, by which a thing is judg∣ed, esteemed, reckoned, and ac∣counted to be as it is indeed, and then it is just according to truth; or else judged thought, and estee∣med to bee as it is not, and then it is unjust and not according to truth. GODS thoughts are alwayes right and just, and his judgement is according to truth. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.2. And therefore a just counting and imputing is here meant, for GOD doth account, and judge of persons, and things so as they are.</P>
<P>Of uniust counting, and impu∣ting falsely, we have some instan∣ces in <HI>Scripture,</HI> as 1 <HI>King</HI> 1.21. where <HI>Bethsheba</HI> saith to <HI>David,</HI> I and my sonne <HI>Salomon</HI> shall bee counted offenders, that is usur∣ping
<PB N="181" REF="99"/>
<HI>Adoniah,</HI> and his wicked company will esteeme and iudge us, and use us accordingly,</P>
<P>Of reputing and counting truely as the thing is, wee have exam∣ples also, as <HI>Nehem.</HI> 13.13. where it is said of the chosen <HI>Levites</HI> that they were counted faithfull, <HI>viz.</HI> upon former experience of their faithfulnesse, and therefore the office of distributing to their brethren was committed to them. And <HI>Levit.</HI> 17.4. where it is said, blood shall be imputed to that man, he hath shed bloud, and shall be cut off from among his people, and <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.30. a seed shall serve him, it shall be coun∣ted to the <HI>LORD</HI> for a generati∣on.</P>
<P>Moreover this word impute, or count, signifies sometimes in the most proper sense, a bare act of judgement and thought. <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.28. where a foole is said to bee counted wise, when hee holdeth his peace, that is, men for the pre∣sent so thinke, and judge him to
<PB N="182" REF="100"/>
be at least in that point of silence. Sometimes it signifies in a more full sense not onely thinking, coun∣ting and judging persons to bee good, or bad, just or unjust, in∣nocent or guilty; but also deal∣ing with them, and using them ac∣cordingly, as in the place before named, I <HI>King</HI> 2.21. <HI>Neh.</HI> 13.13. <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.30. and 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.15. where <HI>Ahimilech</HI> purging himselfe before <HI>Saul,</HI> from the of∣fence of conspiracy with <HI>David</HI> against him, as <HI>Doeg</HI> had falsely accused him, saith, let not the King impute any thing to his ser∣vant, that is, let him not count his servant guilty, nor use him as a conspiratour. Sometimes it sig∣nifies by a Metonymie of the cause, for the effect condemning, and pu∣nishing an offence in a guilty per∣son as hee hath deserved, and to deale with him as hee is justly thought and judged to have deser∣ved, as <HI>Shimei</HI> said, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.19. Let not my LORD impute in∣iquitie to mee, hee doth not de∣sire
<PB N="183" REF="100"/>
that <HI>David</HI> would not thinke, nor count his iniquitie to bee no iniquitie, that had beene against all reason: but that for the satis∣faction which hee had made in comming, first before all the house of <HI>Joseph</HI> to meet <HI>David,</HI> and to bring him againe to his King∣dome, <HI>David</HI> would graciously pardon his offence, and not pro∣ceed against him and punish him according to his fauit, though guilty and worthy of punishment. Sometimes it signifies by a Meta∣phore to count one thing, as if it were another, or no better then another, or of the same value, as <HI>Prov.</HI> 27.4. where a flattering salutation, or blessing given with a loud voice is said to be counted a curse, that is, esteemed no better then a curse. Sometimes to use one as if he counted him of ano∣ther condition, as <HI>Gen.</HI> 31.15. where it is said that <HI>Laban</HI> count∣ed his daughters strangers, that is, used them as he had counted them strangers, and <HI>Iob</HI> 31.10. where
<PB N="184" REF="101"/>
<HI>Iob</HI> saith that GOD counted him for his enemy, that is, afflicted and plagued him as if he had coun∣ted him his enemy. Sometimes the word signifies to skore up, or put upon a mans account, either the offence or debt which he runs into himselfe, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.13. where it is said, that sinne is not imputed where there is no Law, that is, it is not so skored up, that they are punished for it, it is not judged and punished in them; Or the debt which he takes upon him for another, as <HI>Philemon verse</HI> 18. If hee hath wronged thee or is in∣debted to thee, put that on mine account, that is, impute and count it to me, set it on my skore. Now the severall significations of the severall wordes being thus laid open, I proceed more parti∣cularly to every word to shew the true sense, and meaning of it in these speeches of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> and to shew how farre the speeches may bee extended. And first by faith and beleeving which is
<PB N="185" REF="101"/>
counted to every true beleever, and was counted to <HI>Abraham</HI> for righteousnes; I here understand (according to the judgement of the most Orthodox Divines) the true holy, spirituall faith and be∣liefe, which is before shewed to have beene in <HI>Abraham,</HI> and which is proper to the elect rege∣nerate, and is said to be imputed for righteousnes. By righteous∣nes is here meant Evangelicall righteousnes (which is opposed to the legall righteousnes of workes, which is inherent in every man, and is every mans fulfilling of the Law in his owne person) even the righteousnes and perfect satisfa∣ction of <HI>Christ,</HI> GOD and man, our mediatour and surety, which he the sonne of GOD in mans na∣ture performed to the Law, and which is apprehended by every true beleever, and applyed to him∣selfe by a lively faith, whereof al∣so he hath true communion, and is truely made partaker by his spirtu∣al union, with <HI>Christ,</HI> of whose my∣sticall
<PB N="189" REF="102"/>
body, hee is a member, be∣ing thereinto engraffed and bap∣tized by one spirit. By the impu∣ting, and counting of that faith for righteousnes to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to every one of his faithfull seed, is here meant GODS setting of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes on every true beleevers skore, and putting it on his account, and judging, count∣ing, and esteeming him no more guilty of sinne, but perfectly righ∣teous by that Evangelicall righte∣ousnes, which is called the righte∣ousnes of GOD, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. be∣cause GOD performed it in mans nature; and the righteousnes of faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.13. and not of workes, because it is applyed and enjoyed by faith, <HI>Philip</HI> 3.9.</P>
<P>For the confirmation of this ex∣position and iustifying of this truth, wee need seeke no other ar∣guments, but such as may bee ga∣thered from the <HI>Apostles</HI> owne words as in other of his <HI>Epistles,</HI> so especially in this to the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="argument"/> The first argument is drawne
<PB N="187" REF="102"/>
from the 2. Chapter of this Epistle; <HI>v.</HI> 26. where this word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
as it signifies to bee imputed or counted, is first used by the <HI>Apostle</HI> in the very same phrase, as here in this Chapter 4.3.5▪9. If (saith he) the uncircumcision keep the righ∣teousnes of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for cir∣cumcision? By uncircumcision, in the first clause, we must necessari∣ly understand a <HI>Gentile</HI> uncircum∣cised (as learned <HI>Beza</HI> in his notes observes) and that by a trope of speech which is called <HI>Metonymia adjuncti,</HI> for with some reason it may be supposed that an uncircum∣cised man, may observe the pre∣cepts of righteousnes contained in the law; but it is against common sense, to suppose that the fore-skin of any mans flesh not cut off, should performe the righteousnes of the Law, no man in his right wits will father such a senseles meaning up∣on the learned <HI>Apostle.</HI> The same word in the second clause (as <HI>Beza</HI> also well observes) cannot with a∣ny
<PB N="188" REF="103"/>
reason bee thought to signifie the foreskin of mans flesh not cut off, that is uncircumcision in a pro∣per sense, for that cannot but most falsely be reputed, and counted for circumcision, because they are con∣tradictories one to another. But here by a trope or Metonymie (cal∣led <HI>Metonymia signipro re signatâ</HI>) the word uncircumcision signifies the state of <HI>Gētilisme.</HI> Neither doth it signifie that state barely conside∣red by it selfe, but as comprehen∣ding in it the righteousnes of the Law, which the uncircumcised man hath kept and performed in that state, as the wordes necessari∣ly imply, for the <HI>Apostle</HI> doth not say that uncircumcision simply, but uncircūcision which hath kept the righteousnes of the Law, shall bee counted for circumcision. So that here is a <HI>Metalepsis</HI> or double trope, to wit, first uncircumcision put for <HI>Gentilisme,</HI> of which it is a signe or adjunct, and secondly put not onely for that state of a <HI>Gentile,</HI> but also for the righteousnesse
<PB N="189" REF="103"/>
of the Law, kept by the man in that outward state of a <HI>Gentile,</HI> un∣circumcised which is a <HI>Metonymie</HI> of the subject containing for the thing contained. Yea if wee looke thoroughly into the phrase, wee shall see that the state of the man uncircumcised, or the man in that estate, put for that which hee hath done, and performed even the righte∣ousnes of the Law.</P>
<P>By circumcision we cannot with reason understand, the outward cutting away of the foreskin of mans flesh, neither taken literally and carnally as the corrupt &amp; blind <HI>Iewes</HI> did take it, for a worke of righteousnesse and obedience to the Law for justification. The <HI>Apostle</HI> affirmes, <HI>Galatians</HI> 5.3. that so taken it was an obligation, by which the cir∣cumcised was bound, under paine of cutting off for ever, to performe the whole Law. And for a righte∣ous <HI>Gentile</HI> to bee brought under this bondage was no benefit, but a
<PB N="190" REF="104"/>
miserable condition an ill reward of his keeping the Law.</P>
<P>Neither can circumcision be here taken sacramentally as it was an outward signe and seale of the righteousnes of faith, and of mor∣tification, and all vertues of holy∣nesse by which men are sanctified to <HI>GOD,</HI> and become his peculiar people. For <HI>Ishmael, Esau,</HI> and all the Sonnes of <HI>Belial</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> even <HI>Elies</HI> wicked Sons, and the rest were partakers of the out∣ward signe and sacrament of cir∣cumcsion, and yet being destitute of the inward grace, signified, their circumcision was no reward to them, but was a witnes to con∣demne them. But the circumcisi∣on here mentioned by the <HI>Apostle</HI> is an honour, benefit, and a good condition, and therefore un∣doubtedly signifies, the inward circumcision of the heart in the Spirit, and not in the letter, so the <HI>Apostle</HI> doth expound himselfe, verse 29. that is true mortification, and sanctification.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="104"/>The word (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) shall be counted, signifies here in a full sense, judging, counting, appro∣ving, accepting, and using accord∣ingly. Now all laid together, the meaning of the <HI>Apostle</HI> must neces∣sarily be this, without any contra∣diction. That if a man uncercum∣cised, do keep and observe with all holy endeavour the commande∣ments of GODS Law, and the righ∣teousnesse thereof, his state of Gentilisme, and of outward uncir∣cumcision comprehending in it a conscionable observing of GODS holy commandement, shall be ac∣counted, and judged by GOD and by all who judge aright, (as it is indeed) the state of mortification, and sanctification, which by the Prophets is called circumcising of our selves to the LORD, and put∣ing away the foreskin of our hearts <HI>Ier.</HI> 4.4. And this man though uncircumcised in the flesh and a Gentile in outward estate, shall be counted of <HI>GOD</HI> for a true <HI>Israelite,</HI> without guile, circumci∣sed
<PB N="200" REF="105"/>
with circumcision of the heart in the Spirit, whose praise is not of men, but of GOD.</P>
<P>This sense and meaning of the words of this phrase is so cleare, and manifest, and so perfectly agree∣able to all true reason, that no man can deny it, unlesse hee will set himselfe to rebell against the light And this phrase being the same with that which is made the ground of this dispute, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. where the same <HI>Apostle</HI> saith, that faith, and believing, were counted to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and so are to eve∣ry true believer, for righteousnes: yea, being the onely place in all this Epistle wherein the <HI>Apostle</HI> useth the phrase of imputing, or counting, except onely in this 4. Chap. and once in the 5. Chapter, where hee saith, sinne is not impu∣ted, it must needs give light to these speeches, and words, in con∣troversie, and as it hath the first place in this Epistle, so it deserves to goe before as a guide to lead us to the understanding of the rest.
<PB N="193" REF="105"/>
Wherefore if we will follow the <HI>Apostle</HI> himselfe, and tread in the same steps after him, being the surest guide, and best expounder of his owne meaning: we must by <HI>Abrahams</HI> believing, by a Metalep∣sis, or double trope (with our lear∣ned <HI>Divines</HI>) understand <HI>Abraham</HI> setled in the state of a true belie∣ver, united by one Spirit unto GOD in <HI>Christ,</HI> and having communion of his satisfaction, and righteous∣nes, which were of force and effi∣cacy from the beginning, to save &amp; justifie all the faithfull, and to make GOD their reward. And by faith imputed we must not under∣stand faith by it selfe in a proper sense, but the state and condition of a faithfull man, and also that which faith comprehends, and in∣cludes in it, even the perfect righ∣teousnesse, and full satisfaction of <HI>Christ, GOD</HI> and man (for there is a metalepsis or double trope, as in the place before expounded) By righteousnes we must under∣stand the state of a man justified,
<PB N="194" REF="106"/>
and made righteous by the com∣munion of Evangelicall righteous∣nesse, and by counting, and imput∣ing, we must understand, the ac∣cepting, approving, esteeming, and judging of <HI>Abraham</HI> and e∣very true believer, to bee in the state of a man justified, and GODS setting on his skore, and imputing to him being faithfull, the righte∣ousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> apprehended by faith, which no man can truely by faith lay hold on untill by one spi∣rit he be united to <HI>Christ,</HI> and have communion with him. Heare then the true sense and meaning of the speeches in question, parallel∣led with the sentence and speech be∣fore expounded Chap. 2.26. which I thus lay down paraphra∣stically.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham</HI> upon a true inward spirituall sense of his union, and communion with <HI>Christ</HI> did be∣lieve and was surely perswaded that GOD was his reward, and this beliefe, and faith apprehend∣ing <HI>Christ,</HI> and after a sort contain∣ning
<PB N="195" REF="106"/>
in it, as by a fast holding and possessing hand of the soule, <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, GOD counted it to him for righteousnes, that is, set it on his skore, and reckoned to him for justification, and judged, estee∣med, and accepted him for a man truely righteous, as indeed hee was by Evangelicall righteousnes. And so, whosoever doth not rest on his owne workes for justification, nor seeketh thereby to be iustified, but by faith feeling himselfe by nature ungodly, fleeth to <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnesse, and by faith feeles him∣selfe to have communion of it, and holds it fast, and applies, and en∣ioyes it. His faith is to him an e∣vidence of his righteousnes, and GOD▪ who iudgeth according to truth knowing him to have share in <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes, doth ac∣cept it for him, and counts him righteous, and useth him as a man truely iustified. Thus you see how the <HI>Apostles</HI> former using of this phrase in the second Chapter, doth shew the true meaning of it
<PB N="196" REF="107"/>
here where it seemes to be more doubtfull. The summe of the ar∣gument reduced into a short syllo∣gisme is this.</P>
<P>That exposition of a doubtfull phrase, which is most agreeable to the manifest sense and meaning of the same phrase used by the same Author, in the same discourse, is the best: Our exposition of the phrase in question, to wit, faith and believing is imputed for righte∣ousnesse, is most agreeable to the manifest sense of the same phrase of speech used by this same <HI>Apo∣stle</HI> Cap. 2.26 in this same Epistle. Therefore undoubtedly, our ex∣position is best.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="argument"/> Secondly, wheresoever the <HI>A∣postle</HI> useth the phrase <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that is, of imputing one thing for another, there the thing imputed differeth from that, for which it is imputed, and cannot in any pro∣per sense be called the same, as in the place before cited, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.26 <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.8. and so it is, <HI>Psal</HI> 106.31. where <HI>Phineas</HI> his exe∣cuting
<PB N="197" REF="107"/>
of judgement, is said to bee counted to him for righteousnesse. And wheresoever a thing is said in a proper sense to be counted, or imputed, or set on ones skore, it is said simply to be counted, imputed, set upon a mans account, as <HI>Rom</HI> 4.4. where the reward is said to be counted of debt to him that work∣eth, and verse 6. and 8. where GOD is said to impute righteous∣nes, and not to impute sinne▪ and verse 11. that righteousnes might be imputed unto them. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.13. sinne is not imputed when there is no Law. &amp; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. not imputing their trespasses to them, &amp; 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.16. I pray GOD it may not be laid to their charge, or counted to them (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <HI>Philem.</HI> 18. put that on my account. Now here in the speeches contro∣verted faith and believing are not said simply to be imputed to be∣lievers, but to be imputed for righ∣teousnes, and therefore faith is not said to be imputed in a proper sense, neither can it truely be coun∣ted
<PB N="198" REF="108"/>
or called righteousnes by it selfe, and in a proper sense; but the speech is tropicall, and impro∣per.</P>
<P>A third argument is drawne <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="argument"/> from the <HI>Apostles</HI> words in the 4. verse where hee saith to him that worketh the reward is not recko∣ned of grace, but of debt; these words imply, that the righteous∣nesse here said to be imputed brings the reward of blessednes to the believer, which reward is of grace, and not of debt. Now there is nothing which can bring the reward of blessednesse in eter∣nall life to him unto whom it is counted and set on his skore, but the perfect righteousnesse, and sa∣tisfaction of <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI> That all do grant to be meritorious of e∣ternall life to all that are partakers of it, and because the communion, and imputation of it is of GODS free grace, and the faith by which we receive and apply it is GODS free gift, therefore the reward of it, to wit, eternall life is of free
<PB N="199" REF="108"/>
grace, and not of debt, as the <HI>A∣postle</HI> here saith, whereupon the conclusion followes, that the righ∣teousnes which GOD accepts, and imputes, is properly the righte∣ousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> apprehended by faith.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the <HI>Apostle</HI> teacheth,<MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="argument"/> expressely, verse 6. and 7. that the thing imputed simply, and proper∣ly, by GOD, is righteousnes, and such a righteousnes, as being im∣puted, brings forgivenes of iniqui∣ty, &amp; covers sinnes, and so makes the believer blessed. Now there is no righteousnes to be found a∣mong all mankind but <HI>Christs</HI> per∣fect righteousnes, and satisfaction, and that is a perfect propitiation for all sinnes, and an expiation of all iniquity to them, who by faith have put on <HI>Christ,</HI> therefore it is the righteousnes which is imputed to every believer for justification.</P>
<P>Fiftly, that which is said to be imputed to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to eve∣ry true believer, is righteousnes,<MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="argument"/> to justification: for the discourse
<PB N="200" REF="109"/>
of the <HI>Apostle</HI> both here, and in the Chapters next going before, &amp; that which next followeth is altogether of justifying, as appeares, Chap. 3.24 25.26, 28, 30. and Chap. 5.1, 16, 17, 18, 19. in all which places, he names expressely justification, &amp; justifying: and here in this 4. Cap. he brings <HI>Abrahams</HI> example, and <HI>Davids</HI> testimony, to shew how we are justified. Now there is no∣thing which doth serve to us for justification, but that which is found in <HI>Christ</HI> our mediator, even his righteousnes and perfect fulfil∣ling of the Law, so he plainely af∣firmes and teacheth Chap. 5, 19. and 8, 3, 4. and 10.3, 4. and there∣fore his righteousnes upon the true believing of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the faithfull, is counted, and imputed to them, and set on their skore, and they by it are justified.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="argument"/> Lastly, as the imputing of any thing for righteousnes, is to be taken in other places of <HI>Scripture,</HI> wheresoever it is mentioned, so un∣doubtedly, it is here to be taken.
<PB N="201" REF="109"/>
For the <HI>Scripture</HI> is the best ex∣pounder of it selfe; and the spirit of <HI>God</HI> therein speaking doth best un∣derstand &amp; shew his own meaning. Now the onely place in all the <HI>Scripture</HI> where any thing besides faith, and believing is said to be counted to man for righteousnes, is that place of the <HI>Psalmist, Psal.</HI> 106. and 31. where the godly zealous act of <HI>Phinees,</HI> in execu∣ting just judgement on <HI>Zamri,</HI> and <HI>Cosbi</HI> is said to be counted to him for righteousnes. Now the mean∣ing of the wordes there cannot be, that this act of <HI>Phinees</HI> was accep∣ted of GOD, and counted to him for righteousnes to justification. For then it will follow that a man may bee justified before GOD by one act, or worke of his owne. Which the <HI>Apostle</HI> here utterly condemneth as a grosse errour, and bends his whole discourse against it. The true sense and meaning of the phrase is no more but this, that <HI>Phinees</HI> performing such an act of godly zeale, as is proper onely to a faithfull righteous man,
<PB N="202" REF="110"/>
who by the spirit of regeneration, dwelling in him is so united unto <HI>Christ,</HI> that by faith he was a true partaker of his righteousnes. GOD upon this act gave him the testi∣mony of righteousnes, and decla∣red and judged him to bee a righ∣teous man truly justified. There∣fore the <HI>Apostles</HI> phrase of count∣ing faith to the beleever for righ∣teousnes, which he often useth in this Chapter, signifieth after the same manner, GODS counting a true beleever for a righteous man, and giving him the testimony of righteousnes, because he is righte∣ous indeed by communion of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse which hee hath apprehended, applied, and enjoyeth by faith.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="confutation">
<HEAD>The confutation of the false here∣ticall exposition of the <HI>Apostles</HI> wordes maintained by the <HI>Socini∣an</HI> faction.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst whereas they hold that faith considered by it selfe in
<PB N="203" REF="110"/>
a proper literall sense, without consideration of the object, or laying hold on <HI>Christ,</HI> and his righ∣teousnes, is counted to the belee∣ver for righteousnes to justificati∣on, and GOD requires in and of us, no other thing for righteous∣nes, neither our owne workes performed in our owne persons according to the Law, nor <HI>Christs</HI> perfect righteousnes and fulfilling of the Law made ours by spirituall union and communion with <HI>Christ,</HI> and accepted of GOD for us. This I prove to bee false hereticall and blasphemous, by these arguments following.</P>
<P>First faith taken in a proper sense is a part of our conformity, and <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="argument"/> obedience to the Law of GOD, which above all things requires that wee give honour to GOD by beleeving him and his word, and by trusting in him as our onely rock, &amp; the GOD of our strength, and salvation. They therefore teaching that faith in a proper sense is counted for righteousnes,
<PB N="204" REF="111"/>
doe teach that wee are iusti∣fied by a worke of obedience, to the Law performed in our owne persons, and GOD re∣quires on our behalfe, no o∣ther righteousnes for justifi∣cation, which Doctrine the <HI>A∣postle</HI> utterly condemnes. There∣fore their opinion and expo∣sition is hereticall, and more impious then the Pelagian and Popish heresies concerning iusti∣fication.</P>
<P>Secondly that which was pro∣perly <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="argument"/> imputed to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and is so imputed to true beleevers is righteousnes, so the <HI>Apostle</HI> in plaine wordes expresseth, <HI>verse</HI> 6. and 11. but faith in a proper sense is not righteousnes. For righte∣ousnes is perfect conformity to the Law, as sinne is transgression of the Law, yea humane righteousnes is a mans keeping of the whole Law, and his observing to doe all GODS commandements with his whole heart all the dayes of his life, as wee read <HI>Deute∣ronomie</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="111"/>
8.</P>
<P>Thirdly that which chargeth <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="argument"/> GOD with errour and falshood, in his iudgement is blasphemous. This opinion that GOD counts faith for righteousnes, that is, thinketh, iudgeth, and esteemeth it to bee righteousnes, in a proper sense, chargeth GOD with errour and falshood in his iudgement. For faith is not any true righte∣ousnes properly. Therefore this opinion is blasphemy, If they plead that GOD by his absolute soveraignty of power, may ac∣cept and repute that for righteous∣nes which is not true righteous∣nes: This doth but more entan∣gle them and involve them in errour. For GOD and his sove∣raigne power are all one: as GOD cannot lye, nor make contradi∣ctories true, so his sovereignty of power, cannot either make that to bee righteousnes which is not, or truely iudge it so to bee. Neither can his infinite iustice bee satisfied
<PB N="206" REF="112"/>
without perfect fulfilling of his Law, nor allow any man to bee iustified without righteousnes, nor will his truth suffer him to count any iust who is not iust. Therefore by this base shift, and wicked pre∣tence devised to hide, and cover their blasphemy, they do runne further into blasphemy, and make his soveraigne power, a tyrant and oppressour of his iustice and truth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="argument"/> Fourthly that opinion which taketh away, and denyeth the meanes by which GOD is revealed to be infinitely iust, mercifull and wise, and makes the satisfaction of <HI>Christ,</HI> and his perfect fulfilling the Law, a vaine and needlesse thing, is most hereticall, impious, and blasphemous. This opinion, that GOD by his sovereigne pow∣er can, and doth accept and count imperfect faith for perfect righte∣ousnes, takes away the meanes by which GODS iustice, mercy, and wisdome are revealed to be infinit, yea it extenuates and vilifies GODS
<PB N="207" REF="112"/>
iustice, mercy, bounty, and wis∣dom, and makes <HI>Christs</HI> full satis∣faction, a vaine, superfluous and needlesse thing. Therefore it is an impious and blasphemous opinion.</P>
<P>First that which reveales <HI>GOD</HI> to be infinitly iust is, that he cannot be reconciled to men that have sinned without execution of iustice to the full, and a full satisfaction made according to his iust Law, if not by men in their owne persons, which is impossible, yet by their mediator and surety, in their be∣halfe, and by him communicated to them, and made theirs, as tru∣ly as if they had fulfilled the Law in their owne persons. And though this satisfaction be of infinit value, yet it cannot profit them, nor actu∣ally merit for them till they be par∣takers of it truely, and really by spirituall communion. This is that meanes by which <HI>GOD</HI> is known to be infinitly iust.</P>
<P>Secondly, when <HI>GODS</HI> infinite iustice was so strict, that nothing could satisfie it, nor redeeme man∣kind,
<PB N="208" REF="113"/>
but a satisfaction of infinite value made for them. And when all the world was not able to find such a satisfaction; that his wise∣dome should finde one out, and have it ready before hand in her eternall treasures, even a full sa∣tisfaction performed in mans na∣ture, by GOD the eternall son, and also the meanes to make it truely and really the satisfaction of every man truely beleeving, that is, by the Holy Ghost shed on them through the Sonne <HI>Christ,</HI> and ma∣king them one spirituall body with him. This reveales GOD to be infinite in wisedome.</P>
<P>Thirdly in that GOD the Father would in this case give his onely begotten sonne, to be humbled in our nature, and to obey, suffer, and make such a satisfaction for poore miserable men, in that the sonne would willingly take all this upon him▪ to doe and suffer what∣soever iustice could require, and in that the holy Ghost, when this sa∣tisfaction could not otherwise
<PB N="209" REF="113"/>
profit men nor bee made theirs, doth not disdaine to take up for his constant dwelling, the earthly tabernacles of mens bodies, and to worke in them all graces needfull, to conforme them to <HI>Christ,</HI> and to make them sensibly to enjoy him with all his benefits. This most wonderfully shewes GODS infi∣nite mercy, bounty and free good∣nesse. And all these meanes which are manifested and main∣tained by our Doctrine of justifica∣tion, this wicked opinion of the <HI>Socinians</HI> doth utterly take away. First it denies GODS justice to re∣quire mans communion of such an infinite satisfaction made by <HI>Christ</HI> for him: it treads GODS justice under foote by his soveraignty of power, and maugre justice, it makes mans imperfect faith to go current for righteousnes, and to be accepted for perfect righteouses, to justification. Secondly if GOD by soveraignty of power can beare downe justice, and make any weak and imperfect thing such as mans
<PB N="210" REF="114"/>
faith is; serve in stead of <HI>Christs</HI> full satisfaction and perfect righte∣ousnes: Then hee might by the same power have appointed the sa∣crifice of a Lamb, or any cleane beast, or the satisfaction of any mere man, and so it will follow that the giving of his son to bee made man, was no point of wise∣dome, but a going farre about, and spending much, even <HI>Christs</HI> blood, when lesse might have ser∣ved the turne. As for GODS good∣nesse mercy and bounty, they are hereby made painted shewes and shadowes, yea needlesse prodiga∣lity, and <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction is made vaine and superfluous. Ther∣fore this opinion which brings in such impious consequences, is blasphemous and hereticall.</P>
<P>Fiftly, that opinion which over∣throwes the sacraments of the Gospel, and takes away the true use of them, is heriticall, prophane, and impious. This opinion that <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse is not impu∣ted to the faithfull, doth so. For
<PB N="211" REF="114"/>
the sacraments are seales of our u∣nion, and communion with <HI>Christ:</HI> Baptisme seales our engraffing into <HI>Christ</HI> in our new birth, by which we become one with him. The LORDS Supper is such a lively seale of our communion with <HI>Christ,</HI> in the benefits of his death, passion, and full satisfaction, ex∣pressed under the termes of eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, that it is commonly called, the communion of the faithfull, when it is rightly received. But these Hereticks while by imputing faith in a proper sense, they exclude the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to the faithfull, they deny their communion, and union with <HI>Christ,</HI> they take away the truth and the use of the Sacraments, for if the faithfull are regenerate, and by one spirit ingraffed into <HI>Christ,</HI> and united unto him, as Baptisme signifieth, and sealeth: and if they have spiritual communion with <HI>Christ</HI> of his righteousnes, and all other benefits which the <HI>LORDS</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="115"/>
Supper signifieth, and is thereof a seale to them: Then GOD whose judgment is according to truth, cannot but impute <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes to them, and accept it for them, and account it theirs. They who deny GODS imputing of it do either charge <HI>GOD</HI> with injustice, and error of judgment in not counting, and iudging that to be theirs in which they have commu∣nion, and interest, or else they de∣ny the union and communion of the faithfull with <HI>Christ,</HI> and make the sacraments lying signes, and seales of false things, and things which are not. Therefore their opinion is most abominable, pro∣fane, impious, and blasphemous.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="argument"/> Sixtly, that opinion which is in∣vented, and maintained by Here∣tiks, who deny the eternall God∣head of <HI>Christ,</HI> and tends mainely to perswade that there is no use of <HI>Christs</HI> being GOD, and man, in one person, is Hereticall and blas∣phemous. Such is this opinion of the <HI>Socinians,</HI> it is an invention of
<PB N="213" REF="115"/>
Haretiks, and tends to take away the use of <HI>Christs</HI> being <HI>GOD,</HI> and to perswade men that there is no necessary use of his being <HI>GOD,</HI> and man in one person. For all Orthodox Divines give this rea∣sō, why it was necessary that <HI>Christ</HI> the mediator should be GOD in our nature, even that the obedience &amp; suffering which he did under goe in mans nature, might be the obe∣dience and suffering of GOD, and so of infinite value, and though of him alone, and but for a time, yet of more worth, then if all men in their owne persons had obeyed as much as hee did and suffered for ever in Hell. They teach also, that first for the removing of so great evils, as the infinite wrath of GOD, eternall death, and torment in Hell: and secondly, for pur∣chase of so great a good, as is the state of righteousnesse, and of grace, and also of eternall glory in Heaven. GODS justice could require no lesse satisfaction, and righteousnes, nor be satisfied with
<PB N="214" REF="116"/>
any other, but that which is per∣formed by him, who is GOD and man, in one person, that is the per∣fect righteousnes and satisfaction of <HI>Christ</HI> which alone by the infi∣nite value which it receives from his God-head, is fit to remove so infinite an evil, and to procure so infinite a good to men▪ But the maintainers of this <HI>Socinian</HI> opini∣on by denying that GODS infinite justice stands in strength to exact such a satisfaction being over-ru∣led, and oppressed, by absolute so∣veraignty of power; and by teach∣ing that mercy, and bounty run be∣yond reason, freeing men from all need of such an infinite satisfaction to be communicated &amp; imputed to them, and justifying them freely without righteousnes, they do take away the use of <HI>Christs</HI> God-head in his mediation, and the causes, and reasons, for which it was necessary that he should be <HI>GOD</HI> as well as man: And in conclusion, in places where they dare be bold to disclose the secret
<PB N="215" REF="116"/>
thoughts of their hearts, they roundly deny <HI>Christ</HI> to be the Sonne of GOD, of the same substance with <HI>GOD</HI> the Father. Therefore this their opinion is most impious, blasphemous, and Hereticall: And indeed it is never found in Histo∣ries, to have been maintained by any but Samosatenian Heretiks, deadly enemies to <HI>Christs</HI> deity.</P>
<P>Lastly, that opinion which is builded upon an Hereticall, and blasphemous ground, and is upheld, and maintained by blasphemous arguments, which do shake, and e∣ven raze the maine foundations of true Religion, must needs be most wicked and blasphemous: and such is this opinion; for it is builded upon this blasphemous ground, that <HI>GOD</HI> by his sove∣raigne power may do and will, things contrary to his justice, that is, count and accept that for righ∣teousnes, which is no righteousnes, nor worthy to be accounted an act of perfect righteousnes, for such is the faith of fraile man taken in a proper sense.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="117"/>The arguments by which it is commonly maintained are also blas∣phemous, and wicked; to wit▪ First they argue, that <HI>Christs</HI> righ∣teousnes is not imputed to true be∣lievers, neither can be made or counted theirs by <HI>GOD.</HI> Because <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes is the righte∣ousnes of another far different from them: and <HI>GOD</HI> cannot iustify one, by anothers righteous∣nes, and therefore we are not iusti∣fied by <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, nei∣ther is it imputed in iustification. Now what is this but a denying of the union, of the faithfull with <HI>Christ,</HI> for if he be one with us, and we one with him, then are our sinnes made his by communion, and in him satisfied, and his righ∣teousnes and satisfaction is made ours, and we thereby are pardon∣ed, and iustified, by it as it, is made ours, and is not the righteousnes of a stranger, nor of one who is a∣nother so different from us, but that he and we are one spirituall body, and all his benefits are ours,
<PB N="217" REF="117"/>
and we have an interest in them, and possesse them, and enioy them; so far as every one hath need of them. As this argument tends to overthrow our union with <HI>Christ,</HI> so <HI>A. Wotton</HI> in a manuscript of es∣sayes, doth professe that our uni∣on with <HI>Christ</HI> is onely metaphori∣call. Secondly, they argue that the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> cannot be sufficient for the elect, nor count∣ed to them for all righteousnesse which is in effect a denying of <HI>Christ</HI> to be <HI>GOD</HI> and man in one person, for if they acknowledg him to be <HI>GOD,</HI> they must needs hold that his righteousnes and ful∣filling of the Law, is of more worth and value, then if all men in the world had fulfilled the Law, in their owne persons without failing in one point.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they argue that if <HI>Christ</HI> his righteousnes, and satisfaction be so made ours, and imputed to us that the Law may be said to be fulfilled in us, &amp; we may said to have satisfied <HI>GODS</HI> iustice, in
<PB N="218" REF="118"/>
him our head, and by him our surety, then is there no place left for pardon, and free forgivenesse of our sinnes, for pardon and sa∣tisfaction are contrary. By which they overthrow the Doctrine of redemption, and of <HI>Christs</HI> satis∣faction for us, and deny <HI>Christ</HI> to be our redeemer, and to have paid our ransome, and made a full satis∣faction to the justice of GOD for our sinnes, contrary to the <HI>Scrip∣tures,</HI> and the judgement and be∣liefe of all Christian Divines, who teach that <HI>Christ</HI> hath paid our ransome, is our <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and properly called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> our re∣deemer. And though GODS justice exacted of <HI>Christ</HI> our surety a full ransome, and did not abate him the least farthing of our debt, yet we are freely pardoned, and have free forgivenesse, and are free∣ly iustified by GODS grace, be∣cause hee did freely give his owne son to satisfy &amp; fulfill the Law for us, &amp; doth freely by his grace, and the free gift of his spirit unite us to <HI>Christ,</HI> and make us partakers
<PB N="219" REF="118"/>
of his satisfaction, &amp; imputing his satisfaction freely to us doth for it freely forgive our sinnes, and justi∣fie us. Fourthly while they argue that faith in a proper sense is all the righteousnes which the faithfull have for justification; and yet faith is not any formall righteousnes, by their owne confession, yea they de∣ny that any formall righteousnes is required in justification; hereby they deny the Saints justified to be righteous contrary to the Scrip∣tures which call them the righte∣ous, and the generation of the righteous, <HI>Psal.</HI> 1.6. and 14.5. and the righteous nation, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.2. and in many other places, which title GODS spirit would ne∣ver give to them, if they were not formally righteous, by righte∣ousnes, communicated to them after a spirituall &amp; heavenly man∣ner. For to hold as they doe, that men are justified and counted righ∣teous without any formall righte∣ousnes, which doth constitute and give being to a righteous and ju∣stified
<PB N="220" REF="119"/>
man, as he is righteous and justified, is a monstrous opinion contrary to reason.</P>
<P>Fiftly while they deny that the faithfull are constituted and made formally righteous by the obedi∣ence of <HI>Christ</HI> communicated, and imputed to them, which the <HI>A∣postle</HI> in expresse wordes doth af∣firme, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. and 8.4. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.4. they in heate of ar∣gument fall into the Pelagian here∣sie, and are forced to deny, that <HI>Adams</HI> sinne and disobedience is communicated and imputed to his posterity, so as that they are formally sinners by it. And ra∣ther then they will yeeld that in∣fants which dye before they com∣mit actuall transgression in their owne persons, are punished with death, because they are guilty of <HI>Adams</HI> sinne; they doe blasphe∣mously affirme, that GOD being offended and moved to wrath, by the sinnes of parents, will out of the magnificence of his judge∣ment, and rage of his iustice, de∣stroy
<PB N="221" REF="119"/>
innocent babes with their sinfull parents, for terrour to o∣thers; which is contrary to GODS word, and Law which teach that children shal not dye for the sinnes of their parents, unlesse they bee partakers with them, either by communion and imputation, or by imitation and approbation. Whereas they bring for instance, that the children of <HI>Korah</HI> were destroyed with their father, though they were innocent, and not partakers in the sinne; here∣in they contradict the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which expressely affirme that the children of <HI>Korah</HI> dyed not. <HI>numb.</HI> 26.11. For they undoubtedly upon <HI>Moses</HI> his threatning of sud∣den destruction, fled from their fathers tents and escaped, and one∣ly they perished who would not be admonished by <HI>Moses,</HI> to sepa∣rate themselves from the congre∣gation of <HI>Korah,</HI> but adhering to him were partakers of his con∣spiracy, and sinne of rebellion.</P>
<P>Sixtly when they to colour their
<PB N="222" REF="120"/>
heresie, proclayme <HI>Christs</HI> righ∣teousnes to bee the meritorious cause of iustification, and yet de∣ny communion and imputation of it to true beleevers; what is this but to hold that <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nes is meritorious to them, who have no interest in it? which be∣ing granted it, will follow, That <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes doth merit for infidels and damned reprobates, and doth as much for the justify∣ing of them, as it doth to justifie the Elect and faithfull. For true reason can conceive no cause, why <HI>Christ</HI> doth merit more, or con∣ferre more to the justification of the elect and faithfull by his righ∣teousnesse, then hee doth to Infi∣dels and reprobates; but onely this, that he communicates it to the elect, gives them a proper in∣terest in it, and makes them true∣ly partakers of it, so that it is im∣puted to them, and made their me∣ritorious ransome: this while these men deny, they deny <HI>Christs</HI> righ∣teousnes to merit any more for the
<PB N="223" REF="120"/>
faithfull, then for damned repro∣bates. And thus their bent is to set up Pelagian and Arminian free will, and to make this the onely difference betweene them that are justified and them that are damned, that whereas both alike have equall share in <HI>Christs</HI> merits, and <HI>Christ</HI> hath merited as much for the one, as the other, and gi∣ven as much grace for iustificati∣on: the one having power of free will doth use it, and will beleeve, and so is iustified by his faith im∣puted for righteousnes; the other will not use the universall grace given to him, nor beleeve, which he might doe if he would; and therefore is damned: which is a most horrible and abominable Doctrine, and hereticall opini∣on.</P>
<P>Lastly they argue, that as in the first Covenant, GOD required workes of the Law performed by every man in his owne person, and this was the condition which man was to performe for iustification,
<PB N="224" REF="121"/>
and eternall life, and so that Co∣venant was not free, but conditio∣nall. So in the new Covenant GOD requires faith and beleeving, which wee on our part must per∣forme for iustification, life and sal∣vation. And hereby they abolish the freedome of the new Cove∣nant, and make it a Covenant con∣ditionall, and not of free grace. For what soever is covenanted-and promised, upon a condition to be performed, is not absolutely free nor freely given; and so ac∣cording to their Doctrine, they that are iustified by faith are not freely iustified by grace, whereas they plead <HI>Scripture</HI> for their er∣rour, and alledge that iustification and life is promised upon conditi∣on of beleeving. If you beleeve, you shall be saved. I answer that, this is a grosse and absurd mistake. For every conditionall propositi∣on doth not propound the conditi∣tion of a Covenant, which the party to whom a thing is promi∣sed, must performe, that the pro∣mise
<PB N="225" REF="121"/>
may bee made good to him; for such a condition whensoever it is performed, makes the thing covenanted a due debt which the promiser is bound to give.) But oftentimes a conditionall propo∣sition propounds the meanes, by which a free gift is received; or the qualification by which one is made capable, and fit to receive, and enjoy a free gift, as for exam∣ple, it is often said in <HI>Scripture.</HI> if yee will heare and hearken, yee shall eate the good of the land, and shall live, and not be destroyed. <HI>Isay</HI> 1.19, <HI>Ier.</HI> 26.3. and many other places. If we love one ano∣ther, GOD dwelleth in us. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4. If we walke in the light, we have fellowship one with another. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 1.2. If we confesse our sinnes, hee is faithfull, and just to forgive. 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.9. If a man be just, and do that which is right he shall surely live. <HI>Ezech</HI> 18.5.21 In all which, and the like places, there is no condition of the Cove∣nant propounded, but onely the
<PB N="226" REF="122"/>
way and meanes to receive bles∣sing, or the quality &amp; condition, by which men are made capable and fit to enjoy the blessing, and som∣times the signes, tokens, and effects of them, that are in a blessed estate. And even so when GODS word saith, If you believe, yee shall be saved, There is no condition of the Covenant, propounded to be performed on our part, for justifi∣cation, and salvation, but onely the qualification; by which GOD of his free grace doth qualify, and fit us to be iustified, and saved, and the meanes by which hee enables us to receive righteousnes, and to lay hold on salvation, which is freely given to us in <HI>Christ.</HI> Vpon these particulars severally obser∣ved out of their owne words, and writings, I strongly conclude, that this opinion being builded upon such a blasphemous, and Hereticall ground, and upheld, and maintai∣ned by such blasphemous argu∣ments, must needs be most impious, Hereticall, and blasphemous.</P>

<P>First, the letter of this <HI>Scripture</HI> speakes what we affirme plainely, and speakes no parable about it: yea, it speakes it once, and twice, yea, it speakes it the third, and fourth time, and is not ashamed

<P>HIs first argument reduced in∣to the forme of a syllogisme, runs thus. That opinion which hath the Letter of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> more full expresse and pregnant for it, then any truth in religion, or article of our beliefe, and hath all the authority and countenance from the <HI>Scripture,</HI> that wordes can lightly give, is certainely true.</P>
<P>This opinion concerning the imputation of faith in a proper sense is such. Therefore it is a true and sound opinion.</P>
<P>That this imputation of faith, may boast of the letter of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and of all the authority and coun∣tenance that wordes can give, hee proves, because the letter of the <HI>Scripture</HI> speakes it once, twice, yea thrice and foure times, to wit, in this Chapter, <HI>Rom. verse</HI> 3.5. 22, 23, 24. to which I will adde a fift time <HI>verse.</HI> 9.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ans.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The more true that the propo∣sition
<PB N="230" REF="124"/>
is, the more false is the as∣sumption, wherein hee assumes most falsely to his opinion, that which in no wise belongs to it, and thereupon inferres a most false con∣clusion. I answere therefore that his assumption is an heap of impu∣dent lyes. First the killing letter of the <HI>Scripture</HI> may give some countenance to it, that is, speeches of <HI>Scripture</HI> understood, and ur∣ged literally, which are spoken by GODS spirit tropically and in a fi∣gure. This Saint <HI>Austin</HI> calls the killing letter, because they who take the words properly, and so urge them obstinately, they slay their owne soules. But the true literall sense of the wordes, which are improperly literall, will never give any countenance to this here∣ticall opinion, as I have shewed before most fully.</P>
<P N="2">2 I cannot but accuse him here of most intollerable impudency in that he affirmes, that this most He∣reticall opinion hath more full ex∣presse, and pregnant testimony
<PB N="231" REF="124"/>
from the letter of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> then any truth in Religion, or any article of Religion, and hath all the authority and countenance from the <HI>Scripture,</HI> that words can give, when as in all the <HI>Scripture,</HI> faith is not once said to be imputed for righteousnes, in a proper sense, in all the word of GOD, and is onely seven times said to be counted, or imputed for righteousnes, and that tropically; while the <HI>Apostle</HI> useth the phrase borrowed from that improper speech which is spoken of <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 15.6. That when <HI>Abraham</HI> believed GOD, he counted it to him for righteousnes. For it is manifest that in this. Chap∣ter, he altogether insists upon that speech, and doth but repeat it six times: and so likewise <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.6, Saint <HI>Iames</HI> also once useth it, speaking of declarative justifi∣cation, to prove that <HI>Abraham</HI> was justified by workes, <HI>Iam.</HI> 2.23. that is, declared before men to be righteous, because the <HI>Scripture</HI> saith, <HI>Abraham believed GOD, and
<PB N="232" REF="125"/>
it was imputed to him for righteous∣nes.</HI> So that of Saint <HI>Iames</HI> may be believed, faith is not the righ∣teousnesse for which man is accep∣ted with GOD, (as the <HI>Socinians</HI> teach) but that by which man ob∣teines the testimony of righteous∣nes, as <HI>Iustine Martyr</HI> under∣stands this phrase. Now that <HI>Christ,</HI> and his fulfilling of the law is truely, and properly, the righte∣ousnes by which all believers are justified, constituted, and made righteous before GOD: the <HI>Scrip∣tures</HI> do in proper literall speech, as well as improperly more often affirme, as <HI>Isa.</HI> 61.10. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4▪6. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17, 18, 19· <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.4. and 10.3.4. and <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.9. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.24. these twelve places do plainely teach and affirme, that the righteousnes by which men are made and constituted righteous in iustification, is <HI>Christs</HI> obedience and satisfaction, made to the Law, for our redemption, and nine of them are proper speeches; so that
<PB N="233" REF="125"/>
here wee see the communion of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse which hee opposeth, hath more authority, and countenance from the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and more full expresse, and preg∣nant testimony from the letter of it. If I should instance in other truths of Religion, as that there is one true <HI>GOD,</HI> even <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and none beside him; or that hee created all things, or concerning the deity of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of the holy Ghost, or concerning redemption by <HI>Christ,</HI> or the last Iudgment, resurrection and life eternall: ten expresse, and pregnant testimonies of <HI>Scripture</HI> might be brought to prove any one of them; for every one where∣in imputation of faith is named. So that here we see what he cannot proue by argument, he goeth a∣bout by impudent outfaceing to impose upon his hearers, and readers.</P>
<P>But let us examine the proofe of this bold assertion even his as∣sumption, which certainely is as poore weake, and begerly, as his
<PB N="234" REF="126"/>
forehead is strong, like brasse, in impudent affirming it. The letter of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> (saith hee) af∣firmes it plainely once and twice, yea a third and fourth time. There∣fore it is most certainely true. To this I answere, that the letter of the <HI>Scripture</HI> affirmes that faith and believing was counted to <HI>A∣braham,</HI> and is to other believers, but not in a proper sense, but tro∣pically; and so many things are often affirmed by the letter of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> which if we understand them in a proper sense, are most false, as for example. GOD is said to repent <HI>Gen▪</HI> 6. two severall times, to wit▪ ver. 6.7. and <HI>Ier.</HI> 26. three severall times, viz. <HI>ver.</HI> 3, 13.19. and <HI>Amos▪</HI> 7.3, 6. and <HI>Iud</HI> 2.18. and 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.11. <HI>Psal.</HI> 135.14. <HI>Ier.</HI> 18.10. with many more. So likewise an hand, and armes, and eyes, and mouth, are often attribu∣ted by the letter, of the <HI>Scripture</HI> to GOD, which speeches if wee should understand in a proper sense they would prove a killing letter
<PB N="235" REF="126"/>
to us; therefore this is a most ab∣surd and ridiculous proofe well be∣seeming the thing which it is brought to prove. And as he fal∣ters in his Logick and his reasons, so he shewes ignorance of rhetho∣rik, for he takes it for a certaine truth, that one phrase foure times used must needs be taken in a proper literall sense. But rhetorik would have taught him that to use divers tropicall speeches together, is an Allegory, and elegancy of speech often used in <HI>Scripture,</HI> as the places last cited shew. To which let me add one most preg∣nant instance, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. where the word faith in a discourse of justifi∣cation is used ten times in an im∣proper sense, for the Gospel which is the word of faith, and teacheth iustification by <HI>Christ,</HI> and by be∣lieving in him, and not by our owne workes, which the Law re∣quires, to wit, <HI>verses</HI> 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 22, 23, 25.</P>
<P>Now it may be he perceived little strength in his argument
<PB N="236" REF="127"/>
brought for his imputation of faith, notwithstanding, his great braggs, and therefore he shootes one fooles bolt against the imputa∣tion of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes, which is an argument or syllogisme, con∣sisting of an assumption without a proposition, or a conclusion ex∣pressed: but I can coniecture what he meant to conclude, namely, that the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes in iustification, is a mere faction, and ought not to be be∣lieved.</P>
<P>The imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righ∣teousnesse, (in that sense which many magnifie) hath not the least reliefe, either from sound of words, or light of letter in the <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>To which I answer, first that if this were granted (which is most false) yet it doth not follow that faith alone in a proper sense is imputed. <HI>Ridiculum caput</HI> (saith he in the Comedie) <HI>quasi necesse sit, si justitia Christi non dicitur im∣putari, fidem reputari pro justitia.</HI> It
<PB N="237" REF="127"/>
is a ridiculous conceipt, to thinke that if <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes be not imputed, therefore faith alone in a proper sense must be said to bee imputed. <HI>David</HI> tells us that <HI>Phi∣nees</HI> his executing of iudgement, was imputed to him for righte∣ousnes, and Saint <HI>Iames</HI> saith that <HI>Abraham</HI> was iustified by works, &amp; not by faith alone: why then are not works as well as faith imputed?</P>
<P>But secondly I answer that his assertion is most false, and I prove it from the very wordes of the <HI>A∣postle</HI> in the 4. Chapter, <HI>verse</HI> 6. where he saith that to the blessed man righteousnes is imputed with∣out workes, and <HI>verse</HI> 11. where he gathereth that to the beleeving <HI>Gentiles,</HI> though uncircumcised, righteousnes shal be imputed. Now faith is not righteousnes (as hee himselfe confesseth) for righteous∣nes is perfect conformity to GODS law; &amp; this is not to bee found in all the world, but only in <HI>Christ,</HI> he alone hath in mans nature fulfilled the law. As for faith, evē in <HI>Abrahā</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="128"/>
himselfe it was stained with many doubtings, and feares at some times as when he called his wife his si∣ster for better safety: and so it is in the best beleevers. Beleeving also is but a dutie and a worke of obedience to the Law; but this which is here said to bee imputed, is a righteousnes without workes, or any thing performed in our owne persons; therefore faith is not the righteousnes which is here said to be imputed; but the righ∣teousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> apprehended by faith, and couched under the name of faith and beleeving.</P>

<P>SEcondly the scope of the place rejoyceth also in this interpre∣tation, that faith should be taken properly in all those passages ci∣ted, and from tropes and meto∣nymies it turneth it selfe away. It is apparent to the circumspect <HI>Reader,</HI> that the <HI>Apostles</HI> maine intent and drift in this whole dis∣course
<PB N="239" REF="128"/>
of justification, was to hedge up with thornes (as it were) that false way of justification which lay through workes, and to put men from attempting any going that way, and to open and discover the true way of justifica∣tion, wherein men shall not faile to attain that Law of righteousnes be∣fore GOD: that is, in plaine speech, to make knowne unto them what they must doe, and what GOD re∣quireth of them to their justifica∣tion, and what he will accept at their hands this way, and what not? Now that which GOD pre∣cisely requires of men to their ju∣stification, in stead of the works of the Law, is their faith, or to beleeve (in the proper and formall signification.) He doth not require of us the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> for our justification, this hee re∣quired of <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe; that which hee requires of us for this purpose is our faith in <HI>Christ.</HI> Therefore to certifie or say unto them, that the righteousnes of

<HI>Christ</HI> should be imputed to them for righteousnes, would fall short of his scope and intent this way, which was plainely and directly this, to make known unto them the counsaile and good pleasure of GOD, concerning that which was to be done and performed by them to their justification, which he af∣firmeth from place to place, to be nothing else but their faith in <HI>Christ</HI> or beleeving, whereas to have said thus unto them that, they must be justified by <HI>Christ,</HI> or by <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes, and withall not to have plainely signified, what GOD requires of them and will accept at their hand to give them fellowship in that righteous∣nes.

instead of workes of the Law, and will accept at their hands instead of them. Therefore faith in a proper sense, is here said to be im∣puted</P>
<P>To this argument I answere, First, that in the first proposition there is some truth affirmed, but immediately contradicted, and ma∣ny falsehoodes intermingled. That the <HI>Apostles</HI> scope and intent is to hedge up the false way of, justification, which lay through workes, and to discover the ture way, we grant for truth. But like a mad, or drunken man, he immedi∣ately contradicts the truth which he had affirmed, and tels us that the right way is doing, and per∣forming, something which GOD requires at our hands to our iusti∣fication. And what is this, but the way which lyes through workes? For to doe and per∣form somthing required of us, that it may be accepted of <HI>GOD</HI> at our hands to our <HI>justification,</HI> is to seek <HI>justification</HI> by the way of <HI>working</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="130"/>
in the judgement of men, that are sober and in their wits.</P>
<P>Besides this manifest contradi∣ction, I find also much falshood and evill meaning. 1. In saying the truth, <HI>that the false way lyeth through works,</HI> that is, <HI>works</HI> performed in obedience to the Law by every man in his own person (which is the true intent and meaning of the Apostle) he hath a further wicked meaning, namely, that our seeking after the <HI>righteousnesse</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> which consists in his works of <HI>obedience</HI> to the Law, is the way which lyeth through <HI>works</HI> to <HI>ju∣stification,</HI> and therefore the false way. And this he declares to be his meaning in that he immediatly after labours to beat men off from <HI>Christs righteousnesse.</HI> Wherfore, I justly tax him here, not onely of <HI>blasphemy,</HI> in calling the <HI>righteous∣nesse Christ</HI> (who is the <HI>way, the truth, and the life</HI>) and seeking <HI>justification</HI> through it, a false way: but also of stupidity and blindnesse, in that he cannot see the difference
<PB N="244" REF="131"/>
between our seeking <HI>justification</HI> by the <HI>righteousnesse</HI> offered to us in the Gospel to be apprehended by <HI>faith,</HI> even <HI>Christs righteous∣nesse</HI>; and our doing works of the Law for our <HI>justification</HI>; or <HI>Christs</HI> performing works of the Law in his own person. For <HI>Christs righte∣ousnesse</HI> as it was performed by himselfe, was legall and according to the strict termes of the Law: but as it comes to us by commu∣nion, and is applyed by <HI>faith,</HI> it is Euangelicall. 2. In that he saith <HI>God requires somthing to be done of men for their Justification,</HI> which <HI>God</HI> imputes to them, and accepts at their hands instead of the works or righteousnesse of the Law. Here∣by he sets up <HI>justification</HI> by some thing which a man doth, and per∣formeth, which the Apostle alto∣gether opposeth in this discourse and his whole scope is bent against it; and his whole intent and drift is to shew, that we are justified, not by giving or doing, but by receiv∣ing that which is freely given of
<PB N="245" REF="131"/>
<HI>GOD,</HI> and reputed for <HI>righteousnes,</HI> even the <HI>righteousnesse</HI> of him, who is GOD, and is called therfore the <HI>righteousnesse of God,</HI> Chap. 3.21. and 10.3. Hereby also he brings in a doing and performing of som∣thing by men, which is accepted of <HI>God,</HI> over and above that which the Law requireth, which is a meere Popish fiction, tending to dishonour the Law, and to make it an imperfect rule of mans wel do∣ing. And withall he makes the new Covenant a condicionall Co∣venant, and not of free Grace, pro∣mising <HI>justification</HI> and <HI>salvation</HI> upon condition of mens doing.</P>
<P>In the second place, his assump∣tion, wherein he affirms that <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>beleeving</HI> in the proper and for∣mall signification, is that which men must doe and performe, and which <HI>God</HI> requires and will ac∣cept at their hands instead of <HI>works</HI> of the Law for <HI>justification:</HI> it con∣tains in it most grosse <HI>Socinian</HI> errour, and much absurdity and untruth. First, in that he calls <HI>faith</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="132"/>
and <HI>beleeving</HI> a thing done and per∣formed by men, this is directly contrary to the Apostle, who teach∣eth, that <HI>faith</HI> is not of our selves, but is the <HI>gift of God,</HI> Ephes. 2.8. and that we of our selves are not sufficient to think much lesse to do that which <HI>God</HI> can accept: but our sufficiencies of <HI>God,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. and it is <HI>God which worketh in us both to will and to doe of his good pleasure,</HI> Phil. 2.13. so that <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>beleeving</HI> are not a condition per∣formed by us to oblige <HI>God</HI>; but a part of the Grace freely promised in the Covenant, and given to us, even the worke and motion of his Spirit in us.</P>
<P>Secondly, in that he sets up <HI>faith</HI> instead of all <HI>righteousnesse</HI> and per∣fect fullfilling of the Law: hereby he doth professe himselfe a <HI>Soci∣nian</HI> Hereticke in plain terms, and conspires with those Heretickes to overthrow the justice of <HI>God</HI> in our <HI>justification,</HI> and to make <HI>Christs satisfaction</HI> vaine and need∣lesse, as I have before shewed.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="132"/>After his arguing for the impu∣tation of <HI>faith,</HI> he proceeds here in his second way of arguing, as he did in the former, to dispute against <HI>Gods</HI> imputing of <HI>Christs righte∣ousnes</HI> in iustification. His reasons are 3. First, because <HI>God</HI> required <HI>Christs righteousnes</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> him∣selfe, and therefore it is not requi∣red of GOD for our righteousnesse, to iustification. Secondly, because the scope of the <HI>Apostle</HI> is to shew what must be done, and performed by us, and what GOD requires at our hands, to iustification, and <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse is not any thing performed by us, and there∣fore is not here said to be imputed. Thirdly, if the <HI>Apostle</HI> had said that we must be iustified by <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteousnesse, without a∣ny other thing performed by us, this had beene to cast a snare upon us, rather then to open to us a dore of life, and salvation.</P>
<P>To which I answere, that as his denying of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to be imputed, is Hereticall, so also
<PB N="248" REF="133"/>
are his reasons brought to confirme his opinion. First in that he saith GOD doth not require of us the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> for our iusti∣fication; this phrase is not onely harsh, and unsavory, but also full of calumny, and close slander. It is harsh and absurd, like as if one should say, that GOD requires the same particular, and individuall act, done by another, to be not done by him, but by us, which im∣plies a grosse contradiction. It is also full of close calumny, for here∣by he goeth about to make men beleeve, that the orthodox do∣ctrine of iustification by the com∣munion, and imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes, is a teaching, and supposing, that GOD requires of us for iustification, that we be per∣formers of the same individuall works of the law, in the proprie∣ty, and formality of them, which <HI>Christ</HI> performed, and so he openly expresseth his mind in another place, which is a base slander, as I have before shewed.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="133"/>Secondly, in that he saith, <HI>God</HI> required <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe, and not for our iustification; This implies, that <HI>Christ</HI> had need of iustification, and was bound to fulfill the righteous∣nesse of the Law, as a thing requisit for himselfe, and it savours very rank of the Samosatenian, and So∣cinian heresie, which denyeth <HI>Christs</HI> eternall deity, for if <HI>Christ</HI> his humane nature, being from the first conception most pure, upright, and holy, was personally united to the eternall Son <HI>God,</HI> equall with the father, and so was the Son of <HI>God,</HI> and heir of all things: who can doubt but that he in himselfe was worthy of glory at <HI>Gods</HI> right hand from his birth; as his tak∣ing of our nature upon him was al∣together for us, so his infirmities, sufferings, death, and continuance on earth for the performance of all righteousnes and obedience to the Law was for us, and for all the elect, both them who of old before his comming beleeved in him promi∣sed
<PB N="250" REF="134"/>
and to come; and also for them who now doe beleeve in him al∣ready come exhibited and exalted to glory in his humanity. To say or thinke that he had need to iusti∣fie, and make righteous himselfe by his workes, and to merit glory in heaven by his righteousnes; is in effect to deny that hee is GOD infinitely worthy of all glo∣ry, as he was the onely begotten sonne of GOD, and heire of all things.</P>
<P>His second reason is a manifest falshod, to wit, that the scope of the <HI>Apostle</HI> is to shew what is to be done, and performed by us, which GOD may accept at our hands to our justification. For the <HI>Apostles</HI> scope is to shew that wee are justified freely by GODS grace, by the things which <HI>Christ</HI> did for our redemption, <HI>cap.</HI> 3.24▪ and that obedience, righteousnes, and satisfaction of <HI>Christ,</HI> we must not obtaine by any workes of our owne according to the Law, it is freely given us of GOD, and faith
<PB N="251" REF="134"/>
is the hand by which wee receive it, and our evidence, that we are ju∣stified by it.</P>
<P>His third reason is blasphemy, and contradiction of <HI>Christs</HI> owne words. For our Saviour profes∣seth and affirmeth that he alone is the dore, <HI>John</HI> 10.7. &amp; the way, <HI>Iohn</HI> 14.6. and hee who makes him the way and dore, and seeks justification life and salvation by the way of his righteousnes, hee is a true disciple of <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Apostles.</HI> But to call the teaching of men in this way, the casting of a snare upon them is blasphemy. Far be it from me, and from all true Christians not to detest and▪ ab∣horre such impiety, and not to thinke him worthie of the curse of <HI>Anathema Maranatha,</HI> who with his mouth proclaimeth, and with an obstinate heart maintaineth, that teaching of iustification by <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteousnes is ca∣sting of a snare on men, and not of the dore of life and salvation to them.</P>

<P>First it hath no appearance of a likelyhood in it, that the <HI>Apostle</HI> in the great and weighty point of justification, wherein (doubtlesse) he desired, if in any subject besides, to speak with his understanding, as his owne phrase is, that is, that what hee himselfe conceives and understands may bee clearly un∣derstood by others, should time after time and in one place after an∣other without ever explaining himself, or changing his speech throughout the whole disputation, use so strange &amp; harsh and uncouth an expression, or figure of speech, as is not to be found in all his wri∣tings besides, to say that faith and
<PB N="253" REF="135"/>
beleeving is imputed for righte∣ousnes, but to meane that indeed it is the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> that is imputed; were to speake rather that he might conceale his mind then reveale it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="Christian response">
<HEAD>Christianisme.</HEAD>
<P>IN this third way of arguing he layeth downe his arguments a∣gainst the true Orthodox interpre∣tation of Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> speeches, con∣cerning imputation of faith for righteousnes; which interpretati∣on he goeth about to overthrow by severall circumstances, or pas∣sages in the context. I will first sift his first argument here laid downe, and then propound and answer the rest.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>Answer to the first argument.</HEAD>
<P>IN this argument there are more impudent lyes then full pauses, or sentences. The first impudent lye is, that the <HI>Apostle</HI> expres∣sing the state of righteousnes, or of
<PB N="254" REF="136"/>
a man justified by <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes; by the name of faith, and beleeving imputed for righteous∣nes to him, should use an harsh strange and uncouth speech, and expression: what is the man so ig∣norant of the first grounds of Rhe∣torick, that a trope or figure of speech, is harsh strange and un∣couth with him? It is but a Me∣tonymie to expres by the name of Faith, and beleeving, the state of a beleever or a faithfull man, or the object of faith, which faith hath laid hold on so fast, that they can∣not be separated, but he who hath the one hath the other also, and by righteousnes to expresse the state of a righteous man justified. And when we say faith is imputed for righteousnes, to meane that the state of a beleever is counted the state of righteousnes, or of a man justified; or that faith as it comprehends <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nesse, is counted to him that hath it righteousnes: and <HI>Christs</HI> righ∣teousnesse which the beleever by
<PB N="255" REF="136"/>
faith possesseth, is set on his skore for iustification.</P>
<P>A second notorious untruth is, that such a figure of speech as this, is not to be found in all the <HI>Apostles</HI> writings besides. For the same expression and figure of speeches used by this <HI>Apostle,</HI> Cap. 2.26. as I have before plainely shewed. Yea foure times in the foure last verses is the same trope used, un∣circumcision first for a man uncir∣cumcised, and secondly for the state of an uncircumcised <HI>Gentile,</HI> and circumcision for a circumcised <HI>Iew,</HI> and againe for inward sancti∣fication whereof circumcision was the signe and Sacrament, and ten severall times doth he tropically by faith meane the Gospell, and Doctrine thereof, which is the ob∣iect of faith, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3 (as I have before noted, where he discours∣eth about this weighty point of iustification.</P>
<P>A third impudent lye, and ma∣nifest falshood is that the <HI>Apostle</HI> time after time, and in one place
<PB N="256" REF="137"/>
after another useth the word faith or beleeving imputed, without e∣ver explaining himselfe, or chang∣ing his speech. For that which he calls faith and beleeving, and faith it is imputed for righteous∣nes, <HI>vers.</HI> 3. and 5. he explaining himselfe, and changing his speech, <HI>v.</HI> 6.11. calls it righteousnes, and saith GOD imputeth righteousnes, and righteousnesse is imputed. In a word I doe challenge him to shew one place in all the writings of this <HI>Apostle,</HI> wherein he useth this phrase of faith, or beleeving, imputed for righteousnes, except onely here in this Chapter, and in <HI>Gal,</HI> 3. In both which places he cites that testimony of <HI>Moses,</HI> con∣cerning <HI>Abraham,</HI> that GOD counted faith to him for righte∣ousnes, and urgeth it in the phrase of <HI>Moses,</HI> but in all other pla∣ces, where he writes of iustificati∣on, he useth his owne expressions, and saith that wee are iustified by <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction made for our redemption, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. and
<PB N="257" REF="137"/>
by his obedience and fulfilling of the Law <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. and 8.4. and 10.3.4. and that <HI>Christ</HI> is made to us righteousnesse, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. and we are made the righ∣teousnes of GOD in him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. If he cannot shew any place besides these, then let him bee a∣shamed of his doings, in that he hath bent his tongue and pen like a bow for lyes, and shootes out in every passage so many notori∣ous untruthes, that hee may bee suspected to have full furnished his quiver, from the armorie of the father of lyes, the Prince of darknesse.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>The second Argument.</HEAD>
<P>SEcondly <HI>verse</HI> 5. it is said, that to him that beleeveth his faith is imputed to him for righteous∣nes. From which clause it is evi∣dent, that that faith (whatsoever we understand by it) which is im∣puted is his, somewhat that wayes truely, and properly called, his,
<PB N="258" REF="138"/>
before such imputation of it bee made unto him. Now it cannot be said of the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> that it is any mans before the imputation of it to him, but faith properly taken is the belee∣vers before it be imputed (at least in order of nature, though not in time.) Therefore by faith which is here said to be imputed, cannot be meant the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>THe righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> by spirituall union, and commu∣nion, which every true beleever hath with <HI>Christ,</HI> is as truely his, as his faith. For <HI>Christ</HI> is made unto him righteousnesse, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. and he is made the righteous∣nesse of GOD in <HI>Christ,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.22. and that in order of nature before it is counted his righteous∣nesse. For GOD whose judgement is according to truth, doth not count that to the beleever, which he hath not before communicated,
<PB N="259" REF="138"/>
or at the same time doth commu∣nicate to him. Secondly I answer, that if faith which is here called his faith, be faith in a proper sense, and be imputed for righteous∣nesse to justification, then is man justified by his owne inherent righteousnesse, and by a worke done and performed in his owne person, which every Orthodox Divine will tell him is flat popery or worse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>The third Argument.</HEAD>
<P>THirdly granting a trope, or <HI>Metonymie</HI> in this place, and that by faith is meant the object of it, or the thing beleeved; yet it will not follow from hence, that the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> should be said to bee imputed here, but either GOD himselfe, or the pro∣mise of GOD made to <HI>Abraham</HI> For it is said <HI>verse</HI> 3. that <HI>Abraham</HI> beleeved GOD, not that he belee∣ved <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes, except we set up another trope to main∣taine
<PB N="260" REF="139"/>
the former, and by GOD will say is meant the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> which would bee not a trope or figure, but rather a mon∣ster of speech. Therefore the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> is not here said to be imputed for righte∣ousnesse, but faith properly taken. Yea whereas the object of faith as justifying, is expressed with great variety of words, and termes in <HI>Scripture,</HI> in all this variety there is not once to bee found the least mention, of the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI>: as if the holy Ghost fore∣seeing the kindling of this false fire, had purposely withdrawne, or withheld all fuell that might feed it. Sometimes <HI>Christ</HI> in person is made the obiect of this faith, <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.16. besides many such expressions. Sometimes <HI>Christ</HI> in his Doctrine, or the Do∣ctrine and word of <HI>Christ, Iohn</HI> 5.46. had yee beleeved <HI>Moses,</HI> yee would have beleeved mee. Some∣times <HI>Christ</HI> in the relation of his person, and that either as he stands
<PB N="261" REF="139"/>
related unto GOD as his father, <HI>Iohn</HI> 20.31. or else as hee stands related to those ancient promises of GOD made unto the <HI>Iewes</HI> con∣cerning a <HI>Messiah,</HI> to be given and sent unto them, <HI>Iohn</HI> 8.24. ex∣cept yee beleeve that I am hee, yee shall dye in your sinnes. Some∣times the raising up of <HI>Christ</HI> from the dead, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.9. Sometimes GOD himselfe is made the obiect of faith. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.21. Sometimes the record or testimo∣ny of GOD concerning his sonne, is made the obiect of faith, 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.10. In all this variety or diver∣sity of expressing the obiect of faith, as iustifying, there is no sound or intimation of the righte∣ousnes or active obedience of <HI>Christ.</HI> Not but that the righte∣ousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> is, and ought to bee beleeved as well as other things revealed, and affirmed in the <HI>Scriptures</HI>: yea it is of nearer concernment to the maine to be∣leeve it, then the beleeving of many things besides comprehen∣ded
<PB N="262" REF="140"/>
in the <HI>Scriptures</HI> as well as it, but the reason I conceive) why it is not numbred or reckoned up a∣mong the obiects of faith, as iusti∣fying is, because though it ought, and cannot but be beleeved by that faith which iustifyeth, yet it may be beleeved also by such a faith, which is so farre from iustifying, that it denyeth this <HI>Christ</HI> (whose righteousnesse notwithstanding it beleeveth) to be the sonne of GOD. Thus some of his owne nation (the <HI>Iewes</HI>) have given testimony to his righteousnesse and inno∣cency, who yet received him not for their <HI>Messiah,</HI> nor beleeved him to be GOD. And this is the frame &amp; constitution of the <HI>Turkish</HI> faith (for the most part) at this day.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answere.</HEAD>
<P>IN this third argument he under∣takes to prove, that if faith were said to be imputed by a trope or metonymie, and that by faith were meant the object of it, yet <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse cannot be meant, because the object of that faith
<PB N="263" REF="140"/>
which is said to be imputed, is GOD himselfe, or the promise of GOD: But to understand, that by GOD is meant <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nes, would be not a trope or figure of speech, but a monster of speech. To which I answere, that <HI>Abra∣hams</HI> faith which was imputed, was a believing that GOD in <HI>Christ</HI> was his shield, and his exceeding great reward. <HI>Gen.</HI> 15.1. Now no man can in believing by a true faith separate the righteousnes, and full satisfaction of <HI>Christ</HI> GOD and man, from <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe. To beleeve GOD to be our reward is to believe that GOD is become our righteousnes, and so our reward; for the reward of blessednes is the reward of righteousnes, and is cal∣led the Crowne of righteousnes. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. So that the argument may be turned thus against him∣selfe. Whosoever truely believes GOD to be his reward, he believes that GOD is righteousnesse, and so <HI>Christ</HI> as he is IEHOVAH, his righteousnes. <HI>Abraham</HI> when his
<PB N="264" REF="141"/>
faith was counted to him for righ∣teousnesse, believed that <HI>God</HI> was his reward: Therefore hee believed that <HI>God</HI> was his righte∣ousnes, and so <HI>Christ</HI> as hee is IE∣HOVAH our righteousnes, was the obiect of his justifying faith. Se∣condly, he hath here one most grosse and absurd speech, which shewes either his palpable igno∣rance in Rhetorick, or desperat impudency. That is, that if one should speak of believing <HI>God,</HI> and meane believing <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes; this were not a trope or figure, but a monster of speech. Here I will intreat him to tell me ingenuously whether he doth hold the <HI>Lord Christ</HI> (who appeared, and spake to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the Fathers, and whom they believed) to be the true <HI>God.</HI> If he denyeth him to be the true <HI>God,</HI> then wee shall take him to be in all points of heresie a compleat <HI>Socinian</HI>: if hee grants that <HI>Christ</HI> is <HI>God,</HI> and his righteousnes performed in our na∣ture, is the righteousnes of <HI>God</HI> and
<PB N="265" REF="141"/>
inseparable from his person; then hee who truely believes in <HI>Christ,</HI> and enjoyes him, must needs be∣lieve his righteousnes, and enjoy it, and to speak of believing in <HI>Christ God</HI> our shield, and reward, and to meane not his Godhead barely or his naked person, but his righte∣ousnes also, and that he is IEHO∣VAH our righteousnes; this is but a metonymie of the subject, which non cane call a monster of speech, but hee who is ignorant in the grounds of Rhetorick.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in his denying, that <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes is the object of justifying faith, he doth most o∣penly contradict that which hee hath writ in the former Chapter, in the 6 part, where hee professeth that <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteousnes, is the object of that faith which is imputed; and if it doth not lay hold on <HI>Christ,</HI> it is not capable of imputation. His rehearsing of the variety of the objects of faith, mentioned in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and de∣nying <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to be a∣ny
<PB N="267" REF="142"/>
object, or thing beleeved: hee doth notoriously delude and gull his readers, and shewes great im∣pudency; for what more often re∣quired in the <HI>Scripture</HI> to be belee∣ved, then that <HI>Christ</HI> is our true sa∣crifice for sinne, and our sacrifice of righteousnes, and that he is the end and fulfilling of the Law, for righteousnes to every one that be∣leeveth? yea, he gives himselfe the ly, and by his owne argument overthrowes his conclusion: For a∣mong the things which the <HI>Scrip∣tures</HI> require that we should be∣lieve, he reckons <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe, and the doctrine of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the promise of <HI>Christ,</HI> the testimony which GOD hath given of his Son, and the resurrection of <HI>Christ,</HI> e∣very one of which includes in it <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes; for if wee believe in <HI>Christ</HI> aright, wee be∣lieve him to be the righteous ser∣vant of GOD, in whom his soule de∣lighteth, who hath fulfilled all righteousnesse, is the end of the Law, for righteousnesse to every
<PB N="268" REF="142"/>
beleever, and is <HI>Iehovah,</HI> our righ∣teousnes; such a one he was pro∣mised to be. The Gospel which is his doctrine, teacheth him to be such a one. The testimony which GOD hath given of him, is that in him we have eternall life, which is the crowne of righteousnes. His resurrection is the evidence of his righteousnes, and that the Law was fulfilled by him, and death therefore could not hold him cap∣tive: so that by rehearsing these as the objects of faith, hee confuts himselfe, and confirmes our do∣ctrine. And lastly, he professeth vaine tergiversation, openly, by granting that <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes is to be believed. But whereas hee saith that Turkes, and Iewes, be∣lieve not <HI>Christ,</HI> and yet believe his righteousnes; this is a mon∣ster in speech, sense, and reason; For how can a man beleeve that a person which is not is righteous, and that righteousnes may subsist without a subject. None can be∣leeve <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to be, as
<PB N="268" REF="143"/>
the <HI>Scripture</HI> calles it, the righte∣ousnes of GOD, unlesse he believe <HI>Christ</HI> to be GOD. Some Turks acknowledg <HI>Christ</HI> to have beene a Prophet, but his perfect righte∣ousnes performed to the whole Law for us, they do not believe. And the Iewes to this day blas∣pheme <HI>Christ</HI> and call him a lyar, an Impostor, a deceiver, and male∣factor, justly crucified for his wickednes. And therefore in this argument he sheweth that his tongue and pen are applied to ly, and forge, to contradict himselfe, and to be constant in nothing but in holding obstinately his hereti∣call conclusions.</P>

<P>FOurthly, that faith which is said to be imputed to <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> for righteousnesse ver. 3. is that faith by which he believed in <HI>God,</HI> that quickeneth the dead, and calleth the things which are not as if they were. ver. 17. But

the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> can in no tollerable construction or con∣gruity of speech be called that faith by which <HI>Abraham</HI> beleeved in <HI>God,</HI> that quickeneth the dead.

<HEAD>Answere.</HEAD>
<P>I Answere, first that a true belie∣ver may truely say, my righteous∣nes which I have in <HI>Christ</HI> is this, that I believe in <HI>God,</HI> who quick∣neth the dead, and graciously cal∣leth and counteth me (who am not righteous in my selfe nor by my owne righteousnes) a righteous and justified person.</P>
<P>Secondly, that <HI>God</HI> did not quicken and raise up <HI>Christ,</HI> till he had perfectly fulfilled all righte∣ousnesse, and satisfied the law for us as our surety. Neither doth hee quicken any dead but through
<PB N="270" REF="144"/>
his righteousnes and by his spirit communicating it to them, the debtor or his surety, layd up in pri∣son, cannot be released, til the debt be fully discharged. And therefore <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes is compre∣hended by that faith which belie∣veth in <HI>God</HI> who quickeneth the dead, because quickning the dead, necessarily presupposeth their communion of the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> and under the name of that faith may by a metonimie be true∣ly said to be imputed to justificati∣on.</P>

<P>FIftly, the faith imputed to <HI>A∣braham,</HI> ver. 3. is that faith wherein he is said not to be weak, ver. 19. and is opposed to doubt∣ing of the promise of <HI>God</HI> through unbeliefe ver. 20. But the righ∣teousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> cannot be con∣ceived to be that. wherein <HI>A∣braham</HI> was not weak, neither doth the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="144"/>
carry in it any opposition to doubt∣ing of the promise, through un∣beliefe, being a thing of a differ∣ing kind and nature from it▪ But betweene faith properly taken, or a firme beleeving, and doubting through unbeliefe, there is a di∣rect and perfect opposition. And therefore it is faith in this sence, and not the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> which is said to bee imputed for righteousnesse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>I Answer, that though <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse bee a thing diffe∣rent from the beleevers faith: yet when the beleever by a strong faith, and without doubting pos∣sesseth <HI>Christ,</HI> and his faith doth spiritually comprehend in it <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse; then GOD counts it to him for righteousnes, that is, judgeth him a righteous man by communion of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, but doth not iudge his faith and <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes
<PB N="272" REF="145"/>
to be one the same very thing. This argument is not to the mat∣ter. It may bee turned against himselfe thus. The more strong a man is in faith, and farre from doubting of the promise through unbeliefe, the more firmely he is united to <HI>Christ,</HI> and the more full communion hee hath of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, and with more reason may hee being so faithfull be counted righteous, and <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes under the name of faith be imputed to him: This was <HI>Abrahams</HI> case he was strong in faith and doubted not, and therefore having firme union with <HI>Christ,</HI> and communion of all his benefits, GOD justly imputed faith to him for righteousnesse, and counted him so beleeving iustified, and righteous by <HI>Christs</HI> righteous∣nesse, and so in like case GOD will deale with other beleevers.</P>

<P>EIghtly whereas the question, or point of imputation in justifica∣tion, is handled onely in this pas∣sage of <HI>Scripture</HI> (for those other places <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. and <HI>Iames</HI> 2. onely mention it, but insist not at all up∣on any declaration, or explicati∣on thereof) it is no wayes proba∣ble but that the <HI>Apostle</HI> should speake somewhat distinctly, and plainely of the nature of it, other∣wise hee might seeme rather to lay a stumbling block in our way, then

to have written any thing for our learning and comfort. If wee take the word faith or beleeving so often used in this Chapter in the proper and plaine significati∣on of it, for that faith whereby a man beleeves in <HI>Christ</HI> then the tenour of the discourse, is as cleere and full as may be, the streame of the whole Chapter runnes limpid and untroubled; but if wee bring in a tropicall, and <HI>metonymicall</HI> sig∣nification, and by faith will com∣pell <HI>Paul</HI> to meane the righteous∣nesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> we cloath the Sun with sackcloath, and turne <HI>Pauls</HI> perspicuity into a greater obscuri∣ty, then any light in the <HI>Scripture</HI> knoweth how to comfort or to relieve.

<PB N="278" REF="147"/>
<HEAD>Answer.</HEAD>
<P>THis argument is no more but his owne bare affirmation, that it is probable the <HI>Apostle</HI> in this place where he handles the point of imputation, would speak plain∣ly, and it is more plaine to speak of faith, imputed in a proper sense: the tropicall and <HI>metonymicall</HI> sense or interpretation brought in, is a compelling of <HI>Paul</HI> to meane by faith the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> and thereby we cloath the sun with sackcloath, in which multiplicity of words, wee finde much vanity. As for imputation in justification, it is not the maine and principall point which the <HI>A∣postle</HI> insists upon, the maine and principall points of justification are in the 3. and 5. Chapter hand∣led plainely, and in the 8, 9, and 10. Chapters, where he plainely teacheth that the righteousnes by which wee are constituted, and made righteous before GOD, is
<PB N="288" REF="148"/>
<HI>Christs</HI> obedience and fulfilling of the Law. The imputation of faith comes in onely by the way, being occasioned by that testimony of <HI>Moses</HI> concerning <HI>Abraham,</HI> which the <HI>Apostle</HI> brings to prove that iustification is not by our owne performance, or workes of the Law, but by a righteousnes which GOD gives, even the fulfil∣ling of the Law by <HI>Christ</HI> for our redemption, which wee receive and enioy by faith so certainely, that if we bee faithfull beleevers in <HI>Christ,</HI> then are wee righteous euen in GODS account; for true faith cannot be nor subsist in any who hath not communion of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse. This to all iudicious men is more plaine, and limpid and cleere, then to take faith in a proper sense, and to set on it the Crowne of <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnesse, especially seeing the <HI>A∣postle</HI> in the 6. and 11. verses shew∣eth that the thing properly impu∣ted is righteousnesse, and there∣fore not faith, which cannot pro∣perly
<PB N="289" REF="148"/>
be called or counted righte∣ousnes: yea he tells us, it is a pro∣pitiation to cover our sins, which in no case can bee properly said of faith. As for his words where∣in he affirmes, that there is more comfort in faith imputed, then in the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> impu∣ted; they are most wicked and more hatefull then any poperie, yea blasphemous in exalting mans faith into the royall Throne of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, and calling the teaching of the imputation thereof, the laying of a stumb∣ling block in our way. It is to be feared that he who thus speakes and writes hath stumbled at <HI>Christ</HI> the precious stone, which GOD hath laid in his <HI>Zion,</HI> as the <HI>Apostle</HI> intimates, speaking of them who make the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> a stumbling block, and stone of offence. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.33. In the next place after these frivolous arguments, hee takes upon him to answer some places of the <HI>Apostle</HI> which are produced by us and ob∣jected
<PB N="290" REF="149"/>
against him, wherein faith and hope are used to signifie their obiects, that is, the things belee∣ved and hoped for, as <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.22· and 3.23. and <HI>Colos.</HI> 1.5. And here he doth use notable trifling, and most absurd tergiversation. First hee grants the <HI>Apostle</HI> doth use in his writings such tropes of speech, which is a thing so mani∣fest, that impudency it selfe is a∣shamed to deny it. And by gran∣ting this, he contradicts what hee hath before affirmed, to wit, that in all the <HI>Apostles</HI> writings such a trope is not to be found.</P>
<P>Secondly hee opposeth what before hee granted, by a forged and false distinction, affirming that the habit of faith may bee used to signifie the obiect, but not the act, <HI>Cujus contrarium est verissimum.</HI> For in the places obiected, the act as well as the habit, and especially the act of faith and hope are to be understood, for the habit is or∣dained to be exercised about the proper obiect, but it never is ex∣ercised
<PB N="291" REF="149"/>
about it, nor reacheth to it but by the act, faith by believing comprehends <HI>Christ</HI> and his righ∣teousnes, and so doth hope by the acts of it, reach that within the vaile. And indeed, if wee ob∣serve it, we shall see in this dis∣course, that faith which signifies the habit, as well as believing which is the act, is here said to be imputed for righteousnes, as ver. 5. and 9. and therefore this di∣stinction helpes him nothing at all.</P>
<P>Thirdly, hee contradicts him∣selfe againe, and grants that the act may be used to expresse the object, but then he flees to his old shift saying that <HI>Christs</HI> righ∣teousnesse is not the object of justifying faith, or of faith as justi∣fying, which error I have before confuted, and indeed it is contra∣ry to all reason; for the proper object of faith, as it is an instru∣ment of justification is nothing else but righteousnes.</P>
<P>Fourthly, he utters a notable
<PB N="292" REF="150"/>
untruth, when he saith, that the <HI>Scripture</HI> where it speakes of faith as justifying, makes not the least mention of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes, and fulfilling of the Law. Let him read <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. and 10.4. and tell me whether the believing of the man, to whom <HI>Christ</HI> is the end or fulfilling of the Law, for righteousnes be not justifying faith, &amp; when we are said to be justi¦fied by the redemption which is in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whether our beleeving of that our redemption be not a true justifying faith.</P>
<P>Lastly, he argues without rea∣son, that though <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes be a thing which is to be belived, &amp; so is a partial object of faith, yet it is not the object of justifying faith, because creation of the world, &amp; <HI>Christs</HI> being born of a virgin, and his ascention are partiall objects, and yet not of faith as it is justifying; but either <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe, or the promies of <HI>God,</HI> concerning the redemption and salvation of the world by him.
<PB N="293" REF="150"/>
To which I answere, 1 that his sy∣logism is without mood or figure: it is as if I should thus reason, That Master <HI>Goodwin,</HI> though he be a living creature, yet because some living creatures, as Asses, and Apes, are not reasonable crea∣tures, therefore he is not a rea∣sonable creature. 2. I must tell him there is but one true saving faith, and that is iustifying faith: and he who can by true holy faith beleeve aright the creation, or the nativity of <HI>Christ</HI> borne of a virgin, or his ascention, he hath iustifying faith, though when faith is acting about iustification, the proper obiect is righteousnes, even <HI>Christs</HI> full satisfaction for our redemption, and salvation, and the iustifying act, is beleeving that <HI>Christ</HI> is made unto us of <HI>God</HI> righteousnes, and we are made the righteousnes of <HI>God</HI> in him. And faith imputed for righteousnes, ver. 3. is righteousnes imputed. ver. 6. and 11. Thus you see all circumstances in the context
<PB N="294" REF="151"/>
stand up in contestation with his exposition, which by faith here said to be imputed, understands faith in a proper sense, and <HI>per se,</HI> not faith in respect to <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes.</P>
<P>But that I may not seeme to conceale any thing, nor give any thing for his upon trust, I will set downe these tergiversations in his owne words.</P>

<P>IF it be obiected, that faith is sometimes put for the obiect of faith, as <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.23 before faith came, and <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.22. he preach∣eth the faith, &amp;c. And may be so used with a good propriety of speech, (marke this bull, that faith put for the obiect of it, is a proper speech) as hope is put for the thing hoped for, which is an expression usuall in <HI>Scripture.</HI> To this I answere, first by concession, it is true, the name of the faculty is sometimes put for the obiect ap∣propriated
<PB N="295" REF="151"/>
to it, neither is there a∣ny hardnes or cause of offence▪ or mistake in such an expression, but it rather addes a grace and coun∣tenance to the sentence wherein it is used seasonably, and with iudgement, as might be exempli∣fied by severall <HI>Scripture</HI> instances, if it were pertinent. But 2. by way of opposition, I answer (Here observe how he playes Jack a both sides.) First though the faculty bee sometimes put for the obiect, yet the act is seldome or never (to my remembrance) the act or exercise of hope, is never put for the things hoped for; but hope it selfe is sometimes found in that signification, as <HI>Col.</HI> 1.5. for the hope which is laid up in heaven, so <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.13. looking for the blessed hope. Now that which is here said to bee imputed to <HI>Abraham</HI> for righteousnesse was not the habit of his faith, but <HI>Abraham</HI> beleeved GOD, that is exercised or put forth, an act of faith, and it was imputed to him for righte∣ousnesse.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="152"/>Secondly though it should bee granted, that as well the act, as the habit or faculty may be some∣times put for the object, yet when the act and object have beene named together, and the act ex∣pressed and specified by an object proper to it, and somewhat im∣mediately ascribed to the act un∣der that consideration, all which is plainely seene in this clause (<HI>Abra∣ham</HI> beleeved GOD, and it was im∣puted to him for righteousnesse) in this case to conceive or to affirme, that what is so ascribed is neither ascribed unto the act it selfe, there mentioned (which is here <HI>Abra∣hams</HI> beleeving) nor to the obiect mentioned likewise with it (which is here GOD, <HI>Abraham</HI> beleeved GOD) but to something really differing from them both, &amp; not so much as once mentioned in all the discourse (as namely to the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> what is this but to turne a mans back upon the text, to looke out an interpretation &amp; to exchange that which is plain∣ly
<PB N="297" REF="152"/>
affirmed, with what is not so much as is obscurely intimated, or implyed, &amp; to make the <HI>Apostle</HI> to speake as never man spake besides, not for the wisedom and excellen∣cy of his speech, but for the uncouth abstrusenes of his meaning. Doubt∣lesse no instance is to be found of any Author whatsoever sacred, or prophane, who so farre abhorred to be understood in what he spake, as to put his mind into wordes of such a construction.</P>
<P>Thirdly and lastly, neither is the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> the object of faith, as justifying (as hath bin said) nor doth the <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> where it speaks of faith, as ju∣stifying, which are places not a few, make the least mention, or give the least intimation of such a thing. It is true the <HI>Scriptures</HI> often pro∣pound the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> or his obedience to the law, as that which is to be beleeved, and so it may be termed a partiall object of faith, somewhat that is and ought to be beleeved: but so the creation
<PB N="298" REF="153"/>
of the world is propounded to bee beleeved, and that <HI>Cain</HI> was <HI>A∣dams</HI> sonne, is somewhat to bee beleeved. And generally whatso∣ever the <HI>Scriptures</HI> affirme, may be called a partiall obiect of faith. But the obiect of faith properly as it iustifieth, is either <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe, or the promise of GOD concerning the Redemption and salvation of the world by him. The righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> is no more the object of faith as iustify∣ing, then either his being borne of a Virgin, or his ascending into heaven, or the like, and either the one or the other might as well be here said, to be imputed to <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> for righteousnes, in that re∣spect as his righteousnesse. Thus you see at large how many passa∣ges and circumstances in the con∣text, stand up in contestation with that exposition which by <HI>Pauls</HI> faith in this Chapter, will needes understand <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse.</P>

<HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction is not imputed to iustification: (as Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> shewes, <HI>Epist.</HI> 190.)

We cannot desire plainer words to prove that faith is not the righ∣teousnes by which we are justifi∣ed, nor so in a proper sense coun∣ted, but <HI>propter Christum,</HI> that is, by reason, of him which it possesseth with all his benefits and full satis∣faction.</P>

These words shew, that his faith was not his righteousnes, but the thing by which he obtained the estimation of a righteous man. <HI>Peter Martyrs</HI> words are, To be imputed for righ∣teousnes in another sense, signifieth that by which we our selves are reckoned in the number of the righteous, and this <HI>Paul</HI> atributs to faith onely, marke the words, hee doth not say, that faith properly is our righteousnes, but the onely thing by meanes of which we com to be reckoned in the number of the righteous <HI>Calvin on Rom</HI> 4.3. <HI>Abraham</HI> by beleeving, doth embrace the grace offered to him, that it might not be frustrate: If this be imputed to him for righteousnes, it fol∣lowes, that he is no other way righteous, but because trusting in Gods goodnes he hath bold∣nes to hope for all other things from him. And againe▪ on verse 4. <HI>Faith is counted for righteousnes,</HI> not because it brings

in <HI>Christ,</HI> and say, <HI>Christ</HI> his liv∣ing, doing, and suffering, is mine, no otherwise then if I had lived, done, and suffered, as he did: as the married man possesseth all that is his wives, and the wife all the goods which are her husbands, for they have all things common, because they are become one flesh: and so <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> are one spirit; by faith <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes is made ours, and all his are ours, yea, himselfe is ours.</P>

<P>And <HI>Tom.</HI> 2. <HI>pag</HI> 385. A Christian is not formally righte∣ous, by reason of any substance or quality in him, but relatively in relation to <HI>Christ,</HI> in whom hee hath true righteousnes.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="171"/><HI>Melancthon in Epist. ad Rom.</HI> 8.4. saith, wherefore <HI>Pauls</HI> meaning is thus to be taken; that <HI>Christ</HI> is given for us, that we may be counted to have satisfyed the Law, by him, and that for him we may be reputed righteous; Although we our selves do not satisfie the Law, anothers fulfill∣ing of it is freely given to us, and is imputed to us, and so the Law is imputatively fulfilled in us. And so when the <HI>Apostle</HI> saith that <HI>Christ</HI> is the end of the Law for righteousnes, that is, hee who hath <HI>Christ</HI> is righteous, hee is reputed to have satisfied the Law, and hee imputatively hath that which the Law requires. And on <HI>chap.</HI> 10.4. upon these wordes (<HI>Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnes, &amp;c</HI>) hee saith, this is the simple meaning, <HI>Christ</HI> is the fulfilling of the Law to the believer, and hee who hath <HI>Christ,</HI> that is, believes in him, is righteous, and hath imputatively, what the Law requires.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="171"/>The Booke of concord subscri∣bed by so many hundreds of E∣vangelicall Ministers, of the re∣formed Churches in <HI>Germany,</HI> in the Articles of justification saith, that when we speak of justifying, it is to be knowne that these three objects concurre, which are to be believed. 1. The promise of the benefit, that is, mercy for remission of sinnes, and justifica∣tion, 2. That the promise is most free, which excludes our me∣rits. 3. The merits of <HI>Christ,</HI> which are the price and propiti∣ation, and a little after, faith doth not justify, because it is a worke worthy by it selfe, (that is, in a proper sense) but onely because it receives the mercy promised. And againe, How shall <HI>Christ</HI> be our mediator, if in justification we do not use him for our medi∣ator: that is, if we do not feele that for him we are reputed righteous.</P>
<P>The Divines of the <HI>Augustane</HI> confession, condemned <HI>Osiander,</HI>
<PB N="336" REF="172"/>
who held that the righteousnes of faith, was the essentiall righte∣ousnes of GOD, and also them who taught that <HI>Christ</HI> is our righte∣ousnes, onely according to his humane nature. And in the E∣pitome of the Articles, contro∣verted by some, they with one consent affirmed▪ that the righte∣ousnesse of faith, is remission of sinnes, reconciliation, and a∣doption to be Sons of <HI>God,</HI> for the obedience of <HI>Christ</HI> onely which by faith alone of meere grace is imputed to all beleevers. <HI>Artic</HI> 3. <HI>de fidei justitia.</HI></P>
<P>And this obedience of <HI>Christ</HI> which is imputed for righteous∣nes, they affirme to be the obedi∣ence which hee performed both in his death and passion, and also in his fulfilling of the Law, for our sakes. <HI>Ibid. Artic</HI> 3. And concerning faith, they teach that in justification before <HI>God,</HI> it trusteth neither in contrition nor love, nor any other vertues but in <HI>Christ</HI> alone, it is the onely
<PB N="337" REF="172"/>
meane and instrument which re∣ceives the free grace of GOD, the merit of <HI>Christ,</HI> and remission of sinnes, and resteth on <HI>Christs</HI> most perfect obedience, by which hee fulfilled the Law for us, which o∣bedience is imputed to beleevers for righteousnes. <HI>Ibid Artic.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Calvin</HI> is so zealous, and so plaine and perspicuous in teaching and maintaining the doctrine of justification, by the communion and imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> perfect obedience to the Law, even his full satisfaction, and righteousnes, that among Christians who read <HI>Calvins</HI> institutions, one would think the very Father of lyers, the Divel himselfe should, if not blush and be ashamed, yet in policy and subtilty be afraid, to call <HI>Calvin</HI> for a witnes on his side, in this point, least the most simple should see and discerne him for an open lyer, and forger, and abhorre and hisse him out with derision. The Doctrine of <HI>Calvin</HI> concerning
<PB N="338" REF="173"/>
justification, I will lay downe in certaine Articles, gathered from his owne writings, especially his Institutions. <HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 11. and 12.</P>
<P>First hee affirmes in plaine wordes▪ that justification consists in remission of sinnes, and the im∣putation of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes. <HI>cap</HI> 11. <HI>ss</HI> 2.</P>
<P>As for the word remission of sinnes, hee useth it two wayes; somtimes in a large sense, for that act of GOD, by which he doth communicate, and impute the full satisfaction of <HI>Christ</HI> unto his e∣lect, and faithfull, so that the whole guilt of all sinnes, both of commission, and omission, is thereby taken away, and they are no more accounted, nor appeare in his sight as sinners. In this sense he calls remission of sinnes in his comment on <HI>Rom. totum justifi∣cationis,</HI> and in his <HI>Instit.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 11. <HI>sect</HI> 4 <HI>totam justificationem.</HI> For indeed when the guilt of all sinnes of omission, and commis∣sion
<PB N="339" REF="173"/>
are taken away by that part of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction imputed, which is called his passive obedi∣ence, or voluntary suffering of the penalties of the Law, and the de∣fects which come in by the sinnes of omission, supplied by his active obedience, in fulfilling the righte∣ousnes which the Law requires, which is the other part of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction imputed; so that now the elect are reputed, and esteemed as righteous men, who have the defects which came by omission supplied, and, have no more the sinnes of commission or omission imputed, the guilt being taken away: this is perfect and whole justification, and is very fitly called by the name of remis∣sion, to distinguish it from justi∣fication by our own workes, and by our owne inherent righteous∣nes.</P>
<P>But sometimes hee useth this word remission, in a more strict sense, for that part of GODS
<PB N="310" REF="174"/>
act of communicating, and im∣puting <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction, which respects the passive obedience of <HI>Christ,</HI> which takes away the guilt of sinnes committed, but doth not supply the omission of righteousnesse, and in this sense he makes remission of sinnes, but a part of justification. And GODS imputing of the active part of <HI>Christs</HI> satisfaction, and counting the faithfull righteous by it imputed; hee makes the o∣ther part of iustification in the wordes before cited, <HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 11. <HI>ss.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>Secondly he constantly teach∣eth, and affirmeth that there is no righteousnesse, by which a man can stand before GODS tribunall, and bee accepted for righteous in his sight: but onely the full satis∣faction of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> and his perfect righteousnesse, which he GOD and man performed in our nature. For that which is not intire and absolute, and without all staine, and spot of sinne, such
<PB N="311" REF="174"/>
as never hath beene nor shall bee found in any meere man, can ne∣ver be accepted of GOD, but is with him sleighted and vilified beyond all measure. And who∣soever prate of any righteousnes in mens owne workes, or doings, they have no true thought, nor least sense of the justice of GOD, but make a mock of it. <HI>Instit. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>ss.</HI> 1.3. and 11.16.</P>
<P>Thirdly he affirmeth that man is justified by faith, when hee is excluded from the righteousnesse of workes, and by faith layeth hold on the righteousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> with which hee being cloathed doth appeare in the sight of GOD, not as a sinner but as a righteous man, <HI>Instit.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 11. <HI>ss.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>And the same <HI>chap. ss..</HI> 11. This is that admirable way of justify∣ing, that being covered with <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, men doe not feare the iudgement of which they are worthy, and while they deservedly condemne themselves,
<PB N="342" REF="175"/>
they are reputed righteous with∣out themselves.</P>
<P>Fourthly concerning the office of faith in iustification, he teach∣eth, that faith being in it selfe weake, imperfect, and of no dig∣nity, worth, price or value, is ne∣ver able to iustifie us by it selfe, but by bringing <HI>Christ</HI> unto us, who is given to us of GOD for righteousnesse, it is not our righ∣teousnesse, but it makes us come with the mouth of the soule wide opened, that we may bee capable of <HI>Christ.</HI> And it is as a vessell or pot; for as the pot full of money enricheth a man, so faith filled with <HI>Christ</HI> and his righteousnes, is said to iustifie us, and to bee counted for righteousnesse. It is a foolish thing to mingle our faith, which is onely the instrument of receiving righteousnesse, with <HI>Christ</HI> who is the materiall cause, and both the Author and minister of this great benefit, <HI>cap</HI> 11. <HI>ss.</HI> 7. And againe, <HI>ss.</HI> 17. Faith is here∣upon said to iustifie, because it re∣ceiveth
<PB N="343" REF="175"/>
and embraceth righteous∣nesse offered in the Gospell.</P>
<P>Fiftly hee affirmeth that the righteousnesse by which beleevers are iustified, and stand righteous before GOD, is not in themselves, but in <HI>Christ,</HI> even his perfect obedience, and righteousnesse communicated to them by impu∣tation. <HI>ss.</HI> 23.</P>
<P>Lastly hee sheweth how this righteousnesse comes to bee the righteousnesse of beleevers, and to bee so communicated to them, that GOD doth justly impute it to them for justification, and accept∣eth it as if it were their owne, to wit, by meanes of their spirituall union, and conjunction with <HI>Christ,</HI> by which they are made partakers of <HI>Christ,</HI> and with him and in him, possesse al his riches, <HI>Sect.</HI> 10.20.23. This is the summe of <HI>Calvins</HI> Doctrine, con∣cerning iustification briefly com∣prised, and collected out of his wordes in the places before cited, where the <HI>Reader</HI> may bee fully satisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="176"/><HI>Beza</HI> in the doctrine of iustifi∣cation, by faith doth fully agree with <HI>Luther,</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> in all the former articles. First he saith, that faith is not any such virtue as doth iustifie us in our selves before GOD, for that is to set faith in the place of <HI>Christ,</HI> who alone is our whole and perfect righte∣ousnesse. But faith iustifieth, as it is the instrument which recei∣veth <HI>Christ,</HI> and with him his righteousnesse, that is most full perfection, and we say, that wee are iustified by faith onely; be∣cause it embraceth <HI>Christ,</HI> who doth iustifie us, with whom it doth unite and couple us, that wee may bee partakers of him and all his goods, which being imputed to us, are sufficient that wee may bee absolved before GOD, and deemed righteous. <HI>Confess. cap.</HI> 4. <HI>ss.</HI> 7. in notes on <HI>Romans</HI> 3.22.24.</P>
<P>Secondly, that faith sends to <HI>Christ</HI> for perfect righteousnesse, to justification, and that it assures
<PB N="315" REF="176"/>
us of salvation through his righte∣ousnesse alone, because whatsoever is in <HI>Christ</HI> is imputed to us, as if it were our owne, if so bee wee embrace him by faith: The righ∣teousnesse of <HI>Christ</HI> which is im∣puted, hee describeth to bee the greatest, and most absolute perfe∣ction of righteousnesse, consisting in these two things. First that he hath no sinne in him. Secondly that hee hath fulfilled all the righteous∣nesse of the Law. <HI>confess. cap.</HI> 4 <HI>ss.</HI> 8. in his notes on <HI>Rom</HI> 3.22.26. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. and 5.12. and <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.9.</P>
<P>Thirdly hee sheweth that wee come to have communion of <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnesse, by spiritu∣all union, and mariage with <HI>Christ.</HI> If (saith he) wee bee united, and ioyned together into fellowship with <HI>Christ</HI> by faith, nothing is more properly ours then <HI>Christ,</HI> and whatsoever is <HI>Christs, con∣fess.</HI> 4. <HI>ss.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>Fourthly hee pronounceth that it is no lesse then wicked blasphe∣mie
<PB N="346" REF="177"/>
to denie the mutuall and reci∣procall imputation of the sinnes of beleevers to <HI>Christ,</HI> and of <HI>Christs</HI> perfect satisfaction to be∣leevers, <HI>Lib. contra Anonymum de justificatione.</HI></P>
<P>Fiftly hee affirmes, that righ∣teousnesse which iustifieth men before GOD, must bee both a full satisfaction for sinne, and al∣so a perfect fulfilling of GODS commandements in every part, on <HI>Rom▪</HI> 3.20. Our learned <HI>Whit∣akers</HI> in his answere to <HI>Campions</HI> 8th. reason, <HI>pag</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. and in the 8 Book against <HI>Duraeus pag</HI> 177.182 183. doth pithily dispute, and stoutly maintaine the Doctrine of the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> im∣puted, which he proves to be the onely perfect righteousnes, able to justifie us before GOD.</P>
<P>Master <HI>Perkins</HI> also in his <HI>Golden Chaine. Chap.</HI> 37. makes the translation of the beleevers sinnes, to <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Christs</HI> righteousnes to the beleever, by a mutuall &amp; re∣ciprocall imputation, the very
<PB N="347" REF="177"/>
forme of iustification.</P>
<P><HI>Polanus in Syntagmate Theolog l.</HI> 6 <HI>c.</HI> 36. doth maintain the same d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ctrine with <HI>Luther, Calvin, Melā∣cthon, Beza,</HI> &amp; <HI>Whitakers,</HI> &amp; proves every point fully by plain testimo∣nies, &amp; invincible argumēts out of the holy <HI>Scriptures.</HI> And in his <HI>Sym∣phonia catholica,</HI> he brings testimo∣nies of the ancients affirming eve∣ry article of our doctrine, and in his <HI>Theses de iustifi.</HI> hee shewes the consent of the most famous Ortho∣dox Divines of the reformed re∣ligion since <HI>Luther.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Musculus</HI> and <HI>Junius,</HI> whom hee brings as favourers of his errour, with other later D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vines, let their owne writings speake, and declare how wicked∣ly hee doth abuse them in bring∣ing their wordes to overthrow the imputation of <HI>Christs</HI> righte∣ousnes. <HI>Musculus</HI> on <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.4. expounds the <HI>Apostles</HI> wordes, (that the righteousnesse of the Law might be fulfilled in us) to be meant, first of all imputatively by
<PB N="348" REF="178"/>
the righteousnesse of another, e∣ven of <HI>Christ,</HI> which is also ours, for wee are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones, and <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3.4. and by the righ∣teousnesse which iustifieth belee∣vers, hee understands <HI>Christs</HI> per∣fect righteousnesse imputed to us. Also <HI>Iunius, thes.</HI> 35. and 36. doth affirme that the righteous∣nesse of faith imputed to belee∣vers, is the righteousnesse which the Law requires, performed by <HI>Christ,</HI> differing onely in this, that legall righteousnesse is every mans fulfilling of the Law, in his owne person; but this Evangeli∣call is the fulfilling of the Law by <HI>Christ,</HI> GOD and man, our sure∣ty and mediatour. And for this <HI>Socinian</HI> hereticall opinion of faith, imputed in a proper sense, for righteousnesse in iustification, No man can shew greater enmity against it, nor with greater dete∣station oppose and condemne it, then <HI>Paraeus</HI> in his commentary on the <HI>Romans,</HI> and in other his
<PB N="349" REF="178"/>
workes. Thus much for the vin∣dicating of the best learned both Ancient writers, and moderne Divines from the foule slanders, most falsly belched out against them by this most impudent for∣ger of false witnesses without a∣ny feare of GOD, or shame of men. And by their owne testi∣monies, and plaine wordes rehear∣sed out of their owne writings, I have made manifest their unani∣mous consent in the true Doctrine of iustification, by the righteous∣nesse of <HI>Christ</HI> imputed to true be∣leevers, and of them apprehend∣ed, and applyed by faith. Now I leave it to all indifferent readers, and zealous Christians to consider whether it bee not their dutie, both to take heed to themselves, and also to admonish others, that they have no fellowship with so openly profest <HI>Socinian</HI> sectaries, as this man and his followers are: you see the Doctrine which they maintaine is wicked, and blas∣phemous heresie. And after ma∣ny
<PB N="350" REF="179"/>
admonitions given by grave, &amp; learned Divines &amp; divers publick cōfuatations, &amp; censures often pas∣sed in publique, against this errour, they still persist in their pestilent heresie, and are more mad to dis∣perse it then before. And when truth cannot help them, they flee for aide to the father of lyars, and make lyes their refuge, and in forging lyes they sinne be∣ing condemned of themselves, e∣ven against their knowledge, and conscience, as the <HI>Apostle</HI> foretold of heretikes, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.11.</P>
<P>How wilfully against the known truth, and his owne conscience, this desperate man hath proclaim∣ed <HI>Luther, Calvin, Beza, Muscu∣lus, Iunius,</HI> and others to bee of his opinion, I have sufficiently proved; &amp; if ever he hath looked into the writings of any of them, his own eyes have taught him how opposite they are to his heresie.</P>
<P>But it is no new and strange thing for heretikes to sin being condemned of themselves, when
<PB N="351" REF="179"/>
they are once subverted. The <HI>A∣postle</HI> hath foretold us that we must expect no better from such, in that place before named. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3 11. Now in conclusion, I appeale to all Christian readers, and desire their opinion and judgement, in the particulars following.</P>
<P>First whether I have not in all this answere declared, and ex∣pressed what I meane by the righ∣teousnesse of <HI>Christ,</HI> which I have proved to be imputed to beleevers for justification. If I have made manifest by plaine pro∣fession, that by the righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> I understand his perfect fulfilling of the whole Law of <HI>God,</HI> and performing whatsoever the Law requires of man for righ∣teousnesse, even a full satisfaction made in mans behalfe, to the Law of justice; Then I appeale to the judgement of all reasonable men, whether my adversary hath not most wickedly belyed me in word and writing: for he hath both wayes charged me, that I neither
<PB N="352" REF="180"/>
hold <HI>Christs</HI> habituall holynes, and uprightnes, of his humane na∣ture, nor his active obedience to the whole Law, or any righteous∣nes of workes by him performed, nor both these together, to be the righteousnes of <HI>Christ</HI> imputed, and thereupon he clamours against me, that I hold and teach a righ∣teousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> which never was in <HI>Christ</HI>: I confesse I have ever taught and held, That nei∣ther the habituall nor actuall righteousnes of <HI>Christ,</HI> alone nor both together, without his satis∣faction of justice, by bearing our sinnes, and suffering the pu∣nishments due to them, are a suffi∣cient ransome to redeeme us, nor a compleat and perfect obedience and fulfilling of the whole, able to justifie us, in the sight of GOD, and to reconcile us to him. Now to affirme that all three together are imputed, is not to deny the imputation of the two first, though they that are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Calumniators may so wrest the words.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="180"/>Secondly, whether hee who <MILESTONE N="2"/> hath beleeved and preached, and in writing maintained, for 28 yeares last passed to this houre, what hee in this answere hath professed, held and maintained, can without wilfull lying, and more then Jesuiticall forging, be reported abroad, &amp; confidently charged for a turnecoat, whom this Adversary by this his <HI>Soci∣nian</HI> learning, and Sophistry hath so confounded, and convinced him, that hee is wholly turned to be of the same opinion, and hath vowed to maintaine his <HI>Socinia∣nisme,</HI> both publikely, and privat∣ly, to the utmost of his power. So this mans followers have re∣ported, and have withall added, that so many as have come with∣in his breath, are all illuminated by him, and being converted to his opinion, do rejoyce in the light, by which he hath shined into their hearts.</P>
<P>Thirdly, whether this Answer to his <HI>Socinianisme</HI> be such, that
<PB N="354" REF="181"/>
both it, and the Author of it have nothing in them but words and passion, and that herein hee is strangely, and monstrously meta∣morphosed from a Minister of <HI>Christ,</HI> into an Angell of darknes, besmearing the brightnes of his face, with the foot and grease of Hell, that the words and phrases of this answere, are the black Princes coine, and there is little in it besides cursing, and rayling. For many such fiery darts hath this Adversary throwne against the Answerer in a scurrilous Li∣bel fraught with lies, forgeries, absurdities, contradictions, and blasphemies, and sent forth under the name of a replie; which is also confuted by the Answerer, and the filthynesse thereof so plainely discovered, that all true Christians, and modest men, will say of it, that the reciting of it, is a full confutation. From all such wicked spirits, the GOD of truth defend his <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> and grant a free passage to his
<PB N="355" REF="181"/>
Gospel, and to his faithfull Mini∣sters, a doore of utterance, that they may preach among all men every where, the unsearchable riches of <HI>Christ.</HI> To this GOD of truth, let us consecrate our tongues, and pens, and resolve with both to maintaine his truth, by his grace, and the assistance of his Spirit, so long as strength, breath, and life shall last. And to him let us give all glo∣ry, now and ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
