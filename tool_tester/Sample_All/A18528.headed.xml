<HEAD>¶To the Kynges hyghnesse, my moost gratious soue∣raigne lorde Henry the eyght, by the grace of God Kynge of Englande Fraunce, and Irelande, defendour of the Fayth, and in erth supreme heed of the church of Eng∣lande and Irelande.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Monges all other ex∣cellencies, moste grati¦ous soueraigne lorde, wher with almyghty God hathe endowed mankynde, aboue the resydue of erthly crea∣tures, as an outward declaration of reason or reasonablenesse, wherin consysteth the sy∣militude of man vnto Angels, and the dyffe∣rence betwene the same and brute beestes, I veryly suppose, that speche or langage is not to be reputed amonges the smallest or inferi∣ours. For therby is expressed the conceyte of one to another in open and playne sentence, whych in the resydue of lyuely creatures, lac¦keth and is not shewed amonges them, but by certayn couert and derke sygnes, and that in sewe thynges hauynge course and opera∣cion onely of nature. Thys speche or lan∣gage, after the confusyon of tonges, sente by goddes punyshment for pryde and arrogance of people, hath bene be a certayne instyncte and dysposytion naturall dyuysed and inuen¦ted in sondry partes of the worlde, as felow∣shyppes or cōpanyenges of folkes one wyth another chaunced, moche to the outward ex∣pressynge of the thynge in worde or sounde, accordynge to that wherof it had meanynge or sygnificacyon. But in processe of tyme, by dilygence or policy of people, after dyuers fourmes, fygures, and impressyons in metal barkes of trees, &amp; other mater vsed for me∣morie and knowlege of thinges then present or passed, sondry letters or carectes were first amonges the Phenices dyuysed and founde, wyth suche knyttynges and ioynynges of one to another by a marueylous subtilte and crafte, as counterueyled was and is equiua∣ualent to the same langages. So as the conceyte of mannes mynde, whyche at the begynnynge was vsed to be declared by mouthe onely, came to suche poynt, that it was as sensybly and vyuely expressed in wry¦tynge. Hervpon ensewed a great occasyon and corage vnto them that shulde wryte, to compone and adorne the rudenesse and bar∣bariete of speche, and to forme it to an elo∣quent and ordynate perfection, where vnto many and many greate poetes and oratours haue hyghly employed theyr studyes and co∣rages, leauynge therby notable renoume of them selues, and exsample perpetuel to theyr posterite. Amonges other the Grekes in all kyndes of sciences, semed so to preuayle and so to ornate theyr tonge, as yet by other of ryght noble langages can not be perfytelye ymitated or folowed. The Latyns by exsam¦ple of the Grekes, haue gotten or wonne to them no small glorie, in the fourmynge, or∣der, and vttrynge of that tonge. Out of the whyche two, yf it be well serched, that is to saye Greke and Latin (though by corruption of speche it shulde seme moche otherwyse) haue bene deryued y<SUP>e</SUP> resydue of the langages that be wrytten wyth the letters or carectes of eyther of them bothe: But of all speches, those whyche moost approche to the latinite, be the Italian and Spaynyshe tonges, of whome the one by corruption of the Gothes and Longobardes hadde her begynnynge, as latyn spoken by straungers of a barbare vnderstondyng. The other beinge also latyn was by Vandales, Gothes, Moores, Sara∣cenes, and other so many tymes blemyshed, as maruayle it is to se nowe vnto what per∣fection these two formed out of the latyn &amp; barbare speches be reduced. Next vnto them in similitude to the latyn is the French tonge whyche by diligence of people of the same, is in fewe yeares passed so amended, as well in pronunciation as in wrytynge, that an Englyshe man by a smale tyme exercysed in that tonge hath not lacked grounde to make a grammer or rule ordynarye therof. Though of trouth (whyche some shall scarse¦lye beleue) the Germayns haue so fourmed the order of theyr langage, that in the same, is both as moch plentie as nere concordaūce to the phrase of the latyn, as the Frenche
<PB REF="4"/>
tonge hath. And verely, lyke as all these and the rest haue ben thus vigilant and studious to meliorate or amende theyr langages: so hath there not lacked amonges vs Englyshe men, whych haue ryghte well and notablye endeuoured and emploied them selues, to the beautifyenge and betterynge of thenglyshe tonge.</P>
<P>Amonges whome moost excellent prince, my most redoubted and gracious soueraigne lorde, I your moost humble vassall, subiecte and seruaunt Willyam Thynne, chefe clerke of your kechyn, moued by a certayne inclina∣cion and zele, whych I haue to heare of anye thynge soundynge to the laude and honoure of thys your noble realme, haue taken great delectation, as the tymes and laysers myght sustre, to rede &amp; heare the bokes of that noble &amp; famous clerke Geffray Chaucer, in whose workes is so manyfest comprobacion of hys excellent lernynge in all kyndes of doctrines and sciences, suche frutefulnesse in wordes, well accordynge to the mater and purpose, so swete and pleasaunt sentences, such perfecti∣on in metre, the composition so adapted, such freshnesse of inuention, compendiousnesse in narration, suche sensyble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd open style, lac∣kynge neyther maiesty ne mediocrite couena¦ble in dysposition, &amp; suche sharpnesse or quyck¦nesse in conclusyon, that it is moch to be mar¦uayled, howe in hys tyme, when doutlesse al good letters were layde a slepe throughoute the worlde, as the thynge whyche eyther by the dysposition and influence of the bodyes aboue, or by other ordinaunce of God, semed lyke and was in daunger to haue vtterly pe∣ryshed, suche an excellent poete in our tonge shuld as it were (nature repugnyng) sprynge and aryse. For thoughe it had ben in Demo∣sthenes or Homerus tymes, whē al learnyng and excellency of sciences floryshed amonges the Grekes, or in y<SUP>e</SUP> season that Cicero prince of eloquence amonges latyns lyued, yet had it ben a thynge ryght rare and straunge and worthye perpetuall laude, that any clerke by lernynge or wytte coulde then haue framed a tonge before so rude and imperfyte, to such a swete ornature and composition, lykely yf he had lyued in these dayes, beynge good let∣ters so restored and reuyued as they be, yf he were not empeched by the enuye of suche as maye tollerate nothynge, whyche to vnder∣stande theyr capacite doth not extēde, to haue brought it vnto a full and fynall perfection. Wherfore gracious soueraygne lord, taking suche delyte and pleasure in the workes of thys noble clerke (as is afore mencioned) I haue of a longe season moche vsed to rede &amp; vysite the same: &amp; as bokes of dyuers impryn¦tes came vnto my handes, I easely and with out great studye, myght and haue deprehen∣ded in them many errours, falsyties, and de∣prauations, whych euidently appered by the contrarietees and alteracions founde by col∣lacion of the one wyth the other, wherby I was moued and styred to make diligēt serch, where I myght fynde or recouer any trewe copies or exēplaries of the sayd bokes, wher∣vnto in processe of tyme, not wythout coste &amp; payne I attayned, and not onely vnto suche as seme to be very trewe copyes of those wor¦kes of Geffray Chaucer, whyche before had bene put in print, but also to dyuers other ne∣uer tyll nowe imprinted, but remaynynge al∣moste vnknowen and in obliuion, whervpon lamentynge wyth my selfe, the negligence of people, that haue bene in thys realme, who doutlesse were verye remysse in the settynge forthe or auauncemēt eyther of the hystories therof, to the great hynderaūce of y<SUP>e</SUP> renoume of suche noble prynces and valyaunt conque∣rours and capitayns as haue ben in the same or also of the workes or memorye of the fa∣mous and excellente clerkes in all kyndes of sciences that haue floryshed therin. Of whyche bothe sortes it hath pleased God as hyghly to nobilitate thys yle as any other re¦gion of christendome: I thought it in maner appertenaūt vnto my dewtye, and that of ve¦ry honesty and loue to my countrey I ought no lesse to do, then to put my helpyng hande to the restauracion and bryngynge agayne to lyght of the sayd workes, after the trewe co∣pyes and exemplaryes aforefayde. And deuysynge wyth my selfe, who of all other were moost worthye, to whome a thynge so excellent &amp; notable shulde be dedicate, whych to my conceyte semeth for the admiration, noueltye, and strangenesse that it myghte be reputed to be of in the tyme of the authour, in comparison, as a pure and fyne tryed pre∣cyous or polyced iewell out of a rude or in∣digest
<PB REF="4"/>
masse or mater, none coulde to my thin¦kynge occurre, that syns, or in the tyme of Chaucer, was or is suffycient, but only your maieste royall, whyche by discrecyon and iu∣gement, as moost absolute in wysedome and all kyndes of doctryne, coulde and of hys in∣nate clemence and goodnesse, wolde adde or gyue any authorite her vnto.</P>
<P>For this cause most excellent and in all ver∣tues most prestant prince, I as humbly pro∣strate before your kynglye estate, lowly sup∣ply and beseche the same, that it woll vouch∣safe to take in good parte my poore study and desyrous mynde, in reducyng vnto light this so precious and necessary an ornament of the tonge of thys youre realme, ouer pytous to haue ben in anye poynt lost, falsifyed, or ne∣glected: So that vnder the shylde of youre most royall protectyon and defence it may go forthe in publyke, &amp; preuayle ouer those that wolde blemyshe, deface, and in manye thyn∣ges clerely abolyshe the lande, renoume, and glorie hertofore compared, and meritoriously adquired by dyuers prynces, and other of thys sayd most noble yle, whervnto nat one∣lye straungers vnder pretexte of hyghe ler∣nyng and knowlege of theyr malycyous and peruers mindes, but also some of your owne subiectes, blynded in folye and ignorance, do wyth great study contende. Most gracious, victorious, and of god moste electe and wor∣thy prynce my most dradde soueraygne lord, in whom of very merite, dewtie, and succes∣syon, is renewed the gloryous tytell of De∣fensor of the christen faythe, whyche by your noble, progenytour, the great Constantyne, somtyme kyng of this realme, and emperour of Rome was nexte god and hys apostels, chefely maynteyned, corroborate, and defen∣ded, almyghty Iesu sende to your hyghnesse the contynuall and euerlastyng habundaūce of hys infynite grace.

<L>And Absolon hys geterne hath ytake</L>

<L>And forth he goeth, ielous and amerous</L>
<L>Tyl he came to the carpenters hous</L>
<L>A lytle after the cockes had ycrowe</L>
<L>And dressed hym by a shot wyndowe</L>
<L>That was vpon the carpenters wall</L>
<L>He syngeth in hys voyce gentle and small</L>
<L>Nowe dere lady, yf thy wyl be</L>
<L>I pray you that ye wol rewe on me</L>

<L>what Alyson, heres thou not Absolon</L>
<L>That chaūteth thus vnder our boures wal?</L>

<L>Fro day to day, thys ioly Absolon</L>
<L>So woeth her, that hym was wo bygon</L>

<L>Somtyme to shew his lyghtnes &amp; mastrye</L>
<L>He playeth Heraudes on a skaffolde hye</L>

<L>So loueth she thys hende Nicholas</L>
<L>That Absolon may blowe the buckes horne</L>
<L>He ne had for hys laboure but askorne</L>

<L>Forsoth thys prouerbe it is no lye</L>

<L>Vpon the whyche broke ther stant a mell</L>
<L>And this is very sothe, as I you tel</L>
<L>A myller was there dwellyng many a day</L>

<L>Ther was no mā for peryl durst hym touche</L>
<L>A Shefelde thwytel bare he in hys hose</L>
<L>Roūde was his face, &amp; camysed was his nose</L>
<L>As pylled as an ape was hys skull</L>
<L>He was a market beater at the full</L>

<L>A these he was for sothe, of corne and mele</L>
<L>And that a slye, and vsaunt for to stele</L>
<L>His name was hoten deynous Symkyn</L>
<L>A wyfe he had, comen of noble kyn</L>
<L>The parson of the towne her father was</L>
<L>with her he yafe ful many a panne of bras</L>
<L>For that Symkym shulde in his bloode alye</L>
<L>She was yfostred in a nonnerye</L>
<L>For Symken wolde no wyfe, as he sayde</L>
<L>But she were wel ynourisshed, and a mayde</L>
<L>To sauen hys astate of yomanrye</L>
<L>And she was proude, and perte as a pye</L>
<L>A ful fayre syght was it vpon hem two</L>

<L>That with her ones durst rage or play</L>

<L>Thā were there yonge poore scholers two</L>

<L>And hardely they durst lay her necke</L>
<L>The myller shuld not steale hem half a pecke</L>
<L>Of corne by sleyght, ne by force hem reue.</L>
<L>And at the last the warden yaue hem leue</L>
<L>Iohan hight that one, &amp; Aleyn hight y<SUP>e</SUP> other</L>

<HEAD>¶Here ende the wordes of our host and here begynneth Chaucers tale of Melibeus.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Yonge mā called Me∣libeus, myghtye and ryche, begat vpon hys wyfe that called was Prudence, a doughter which that called was Sophye.</P>
<P>¶Vpon a daye byfell that he for his dysport is wente into the feldes hym to playe: Hys wyfe and eke hys doughter hath he left with in hys house, of whyche the dores were faste yshette. Foure of hys olde foes han it aspyde, and settē ladders to the walles of hys house, and by the wyndowes ben entred, &amp; bete his wyfe, and wounded hys doughter with fyue mortall woundes, in fyue sondrye places: That is to saye, in her fete, in her handes, in her eeres, in her nose, &amp; in her mouth, &amp; leften her for deed, and wente her waye.</P>
<P>When Melibeus retourned was into hys house, and se all thys myschefe, he lyke a madde mā rentyng hys clothes, gan to wepe and crye.</P>
<P>Prudence hys wyfe, as ferforth as she durste besought hym of hys wepynge for to stynte: But not for thy he gan to wepe &amp; crye euer lenger the more.</P>
<P>Thys noble wyfe Prudence remembred her vpon the sentence of Ouyde, in hys boke that cleped is the remedye of loue, where as he sayeth, he is a foole that dystourbeth the mother to wepe in the death of her chylde tyl she haue wept her fyll, as for a certayne tyme and then shall a man done diligence wyth a∣miable wordes to recomforte and praye her of her wepynge for to stynte. For whych rea∣son thys noble wyfe Prudence, suffred her husbonde to wepe and crye, as for a certayne space: and when she sawe her tyme, she sayd hym in thys wyse. Alas my lorde (quoth she) why make ye your selfe for to be like a foole? forsoth it apperteyneth not vnto a wyse man to maken suche a sorowe. Youre doughter wyth the grace of God, shall waryshe and escape. And all were it so that she ryght now were deed, ye ne oughte not as for her death

your selfe distroye. Seneke saythe, the wyse man shal not take to gret discomforte for the dethe of hys children, but certes he shuld suf∣fre it in paciēce, as wel as he abydeth y<SUP>e</SUP> deth of hys owne proper person.</P>
<P>¶Thys Mellebeus answerde anon and sayd: what man ({quod} he) shuld of hys wepynge stynt, that hath so great a cause for to wepe? Iesus hym selfe our lorde, wepte for y<SUP>e</SUP> dethe of Lazarus hys frende. Prudence answerd, certes wel I wote a temperate wepynge is nothyng defended to hym that sorouful is, a∣monge folke in sorowe, but it is rather graū∣ted hym to wepe. The apostel Poule vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Romans writeth, men shuld reioyce with hē that maketh ioye, and wepe with suche folke as wepen. But though a temperate wepyng be graunted, certes outragyous wepynge is defended. Mesure of wepyng shulde be cōsy∣dred after the lore that techeth vs Sencke. Whan that thy frende is deed ({quod} he) let not thyne eyen to moist ben of teeres, ne to moch drie: although teeres comen to thyn eyen, let hem not fal. And whan thou hast forgon thy frende, do diligence to gette a nother frende: and this is more wisdom thā for to wepe for thy frende which thou hast lorne, for therin is no bote. And therfor yf ye gouerne you by sapience, put away sorowe out of your herte. Remembreth you that Iesus Sirake sayth, a man that is ioyus and glad in herte, it him conserueth storishyng in hys age: but sothely a sorowful here maketh hys bones drie. He sayth eke thus, that sorowe in herte sleeth ful manye a man. Salomon sayth, that right as moughthes in the shepes sleyse anoyeth the clothes, and the smale wormes y<SUP>t</SUP> tree, ryght so anoyeth sorowe the hert of man, wherfore vs ought as wel in the dethe of our children, as in the losse of our temporal goodes, haue pacience.</P>
<P>Remembre you vpon pacient Iobe, whā he had loste hys children and hys temporal substaunce, and in hys body endured and re∣ceyued ful many a greuous trybulacion, yet sayde he thus: Oure lorde it sent to me, oure lorde hath byrafte it me, right so as our lorde wold, right so it be done, iblessed be the name of our lorde.</P>
<P>To these forsayd thinges Melibeus vnto hys wyfe Prudence answerd: Al thy wordes ({quod} he) ben true, and therto profytable, but truely myn herte is troubled with this sorow so greuously, that I not what to do. Let cal ({quod} Prudence) youre true frendes al and thy lynage, which that ben wyse, &amp; telleth to hem your case, &amp; herkeneth what they say in coun∣saylyng, and gouerne you after her sentence. Salomon saythe, werke all thy thynges by counsayle, &amp; thou shalte neuer rue. Than by coūsayle of his wife Prudēce, this Melibeus let caule a great congrygacion of people, as surgyens, physicions, olde folke and yong, &amp; some of hys olde enemyes reconciled (as by her semblant) to hys loue and to hys grace: And therwithal ther came some of his neigh¦bours, that dyd hym reuerēce more for drede thā for loue, as it happeth oft. There comen also ful many subtyl flaterers, &amp; wyse aduo∣cates lerned in the law. And whā these folke togyders assembled were, this Melibeus in sorowfull wyse shewed hem his case, and by the maner of his speche, it semed that in herte he bare a cruel yre, redy to don vengeaunce vpon hys foos, &amp; sodainly he desyred y<SUP>t</SUP> we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shulde begyn, but nathelesse yet asked he coun¦sayle vpon this mater. A surgyen by lycence and assent of suche as were wyse vp rose, and vnto Melibeus sayd as ye shal here.</P>
<P>¶Sir ({quod} he) as to vs surgiens apertay∣neth that we do to euery wight the best that we can, where as we ben withholdē, &amp; to our pacient that we don no damage: wherfore it happeth many tyme &amp; ofte, that whan two men haue eueriche wounded other, one sur∣gyen healeth hem both, wherfore vnto oure arte it is not pertinēt to norishe werre, ne par¦ties to supporte. But certes as to the warys∣shyng of your doughter, al be it so that peril∣ously she be wounded, we shal do so tentyfe besynesse fro day to night that with y<SUP>e</SUP> grace of god she shal ben hole and sounde, as sont as is possible. Almost right in the same wyse the physiciens answerd, saue that they sayde a fewe wordes more: That ryght as mala∣dies ben by her contraries cured, right so shal man warisshe werre by peace. Hys neygh∣bours full of enuye, hys fayned frendes that semed reconciled, and his flatterers, maden semblaūce of wepyng, &amp; enpayred and agrut∣ched moche of this mater, in praysinge great¦ly Melibe of might, of power, of richesse and of frendes, dispysing the power of his aduer∣saries: and sayd vtterly, that he anon shulde
<PB N="lxxx" REF="92"/>
wreken hym on hys foos, and begyn warre.</P>
<P>Vp rose then an aduocat that was wyse byleue and by counsayle of other that were wyse, and sayd: The nede for the whych we bene assembled in thys place, is a full heuye thynge, &amp; a great mater bycause of y<SUP>e</SUP> wronge and of the wyckednesse that hath be done, &amp; eke by reason of great damages that in tyme commynge ben possyble to fallen for y<SUP>e</SUP> same, and eke by reason of the great rychesse and po¦wer of the partyes both, for the whyche rea∣sons it were a full greate peryll to erren in thys matter. Wherfore Melibeus thys is oure sentence, we counsayle you abouen all thynge, that ryghte anone thou do thy dely∣gence in kepynge of thy proper persone, in suche a wyse that thou ne wante none espye ne watche, thy bodye for to saue: And after that we counsayle that in thyne house thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et suffyciēt garryson, so as they may as well thy bodye as thy house defende: but certes to mouen warre, or to done sodeynly vengeaūce we maye not deme in so lytel tyme y<SUP>t</SUP> it were profytable, wherfore we aske leyser &amp; space to haue delyberacion in thys case to deme, for the commen prouerbe sayeth thus: He that sone demeth sone shall repente. And eke men sayne, thylke iudge is wyse that sone vnder∣standeth a matter, and iugeth by leyser: For all be it taryenge be noyfull, algate it is not to be reproued in yeuynge of iudgemente, ne in vengeaunce takynge, when it is sufficyent and resonable. And that shewed oure Lorde Iesu Christe by ensample, for when the wo∣man was takē in auoutry and was brought in hys presens to knowen what shulde be done of her persone, al be it that he wyst wel hym self what he wold answere, yet ne wold he not answere sodeynly, but he wolde haue delyberacion, and in the grounde he wrote twyse, and by thys cause we asken delybera∣tion: and we shall then by the grace of God coūsayle you y<SUP>t</SUP> thynge that shalbe profytable</P>
<P>Vp sterte then the yonge folke at ones, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> moste parte of that company haue scorned thys olde wyse man, and begā to make noyse and sayde. Ryght so as whyles that yron is hote men shulde smyte, ryghte so men shulde wreken her wronges whyle that they bene freshe and newe, and wyth loude voyce they tryed warre warre. Vp rose tho one of y<SUP>e</SUP> old wyse, &amp; wyth hys hande made coūtenaunce that they shulde holdē hem styl &amp; yeuen hym audience. Lordynges ({quod} he) ther is ful many a man that cryeth warre warre, y<SUP>e</SUP> wote full lyte what warre amounteth. Warre at hys begynnynge hath so great an entryng and so large, that euery wyght may entre whē hym liketh, &amp; lightly fynd warre: but certes what ende therof shal fal, it is not lightly to know. When y<SUP>e</SUP> warre is ones bygon, there is full many a chylde vnborne of hys mother, y<SUP>t</SUP> shal sterue yōge bycause of thilke warre, other els lyue in sorowe, or dye in wretchednesse: And therfore or y<SUP>t</SUP> any warre be bygon, men muste haue great counsayle &amp; good delyberation. And when thys olde man wende to enforcen hys tale by reson, well nye all at ones bygon for to ryse for to breken hys tale, &amp; byddē him ful ofte hys wordes for to abrege: For certes he y<SUP>t</SUP> precheth to hem that lyst not to here his wordes, his sermō hem anoyeth. For Iesus Syrake sayth, y<SUP>t</SUP> weping in musyke is a noy∣ous thynge. This is as moch to say, as moch auayleth it to speake byforne folke to which his speche anoyeth, as it is for to syngen by∣forne hem that wepe. And when thys wyse man sawe y<SUP>t</SUP> him wāted audiēce, al shamfaste he set him adowne ayen. For Salomō sayth. There as thou mayst not haue audience, en∣force the not to speake. I se wel ({quod} thys wyse man) that the cōmen prouerbe is soth, y<SUP>t</SUP> good counsayle wanteth, when it is moste nede.</P>
<P>Yet had thys Melibeus in hys counsayle many folke, that priuely in hys eere counsay∣led hym certayne thynges, and counsayled hym the contrary in general audience. when Melibeus had herde that the greatest parte of hys counsayle were accorded that he shuld make warre, anone he consented to her coū∣saylynge, and fully affyrmed her sentence. Then dame Prudence, when that she sawe her husbonde shope hym for to awreke hym on hys enemyes, &amp; to begyn warre: she in ful hūble wyse, when she sawe her tyme sayd to hym these wordes. My lord ({quod} she) I you be seche as hertely as I dare or can, ne hast you not to fast, and for all guerdons yeue me au∣diēce. For Peter Alphōs sayth. Who so doth to the good or harme, hast the not to quyte it for in thys wyse thy frende woll abyde, and thyne enemye shall the lenger lyue in drede. The prouerbe sayth, he hasteth wel y<SUP>t</SUP> wisely can abyde: And in wycked hast is no profyte.</P>
<P><PB REF="93"/>Thys Melibe answered to hys wyfe pru¦dence: I purpose not (quoth he) to werke by thy counsayle, for many causes and reasons, for certes euery wyght wolde holde me then a foole. Thys is to saye, yf I for thy counsay¦lynge wolde chaunge thynges that bene or∣dayned and affyrmed by so many wyse. Se∣condly, I saye that all women bene wycked, and none good of hem all. For of a thousande men sayeth Salomon, I founde one good man: but certes of all women foūde I neuer none. And also certes, yf I gouerned me by thy counsayle, it shulde seme that I had yeue the ouer me the maystrye: and God forbyd y<SUP>t</SUP> it so were. For Iesus Syracke sayeth, that yf the wyfe haue maystrye, she is contrarious to her husbande. And Salomon sayeth. Ne∣uer in thy lyfe to thy wyfe, ne to thy chylde, ne to thy frende, ne yeue no power ouer thy selfe, for better it were that thy chyldren aske of thy thinges that hem nedeth then thy selfe to be in the handes of thy chyldren. And also yf I woll werche by thy coūsayle, certes my counsayle must be somtyme secret til it were tyme that it muste be knowen: and thys ne maye not be, yf I shulde be counsayled by the. When dame Prudence full debonairly and with great paciēce, had herde al that her husbonde lyked for to saye, then asked she of hym lycence for to speake, and sayd in thys wyse. My lorde (quoth she) as to youre fyrste reason, it maye lyghtly ben answered. For I saye that it is no folye to chaunge counsayle, when the thynge is chaunged, or els when y<SUP>e</SUP> thynge semeth otherwyse thē it semed afore. And more ouer I saye, thoughe that ye haue sworne and behyght to performe youre em∣pryse, &amp; by iuste cause ye do it not: men shulde not saye therfore ye were a lyer &amp; forsworne For the boke sayeth, that the wyse man ma∣keth no lesynge, when he turneth hys corage for the better. And albeit that your empryse be establyshed and ordeyned by great multy∣tude of folke, yet dare you not accomplyshe thylke ordynaunce but you lyketh: for the trouth of thynges and the profyte ben rather founden in fewe folke that ben wyse and full of reason, then by greate multytude of folke, there euery man cryeth and clattereth what hym lyketh: sothly suche multytude is not ho¦nest. And as to the seconde reason, where as ye saye, that all womē ben wycked: saue your grace. Certes ye dyspyse all women in thys wyse, and he that all despyseth, as sayeth the boke, all dyspleaseth. And Senecke sayeth, that who so woll haue sapience, shal no man dysprayse, but he shall gladlye teache the sci∣ence that he can, wythout presumption or pryde: and suche thynges as he nought ne can, he shall not ben ashamed to lerne hem, &amp; to enquyre of lesse folke then hym selfe. And that there hath bene many a good woman, maye lyghtly be proued: For certes syr our Lorde Iesu Christ nolde neuer haue descen∣ded to be borne of a woman, yf al womē had be wycked. And after that, for y<SUP>e</SUP> great bounte that is in womē, our lorde Iesu Christ, whē he was rysen fro death to lyfe, apered rather to a womā then to his apostles. And though that Salomon sayde, he founde neuer wo∣men good, it foloweth not therfore that all women be wycked: for thoughe that he ne founde no good woman, certes many an o∣ther man hathe founde many a woman full good and trewe. Or els parauenture the en¦tente of Salomon was thys, that in soue∣rayne bountye he founde no woman, thys is to saye: that there is no wyght that hath par¦fyte bountye saue God alone, as he hym selfe recordeth in hys euangelye. For there nys no creature so good that hym ne wanteth som∣what of the perfection of God that is hys maker. Youre thyrde reason is thys, ye saye that yf that yt gouerne you by my counsayle it shulde seme that ye had yeue me the may∣strye and the lordshyppe of youre persone. Syr saue youre grace it is not so, for yf so were that no man shulde be counsayled but onely of hem that han lordshyppe and may∣strye of hys persone, men nolde not be coun∣sayled so ofte. For sothly thylke man that as∣keth counsayle of a purpose, yet hathe he free wyl whether he woll do after that counsayle or none. And as to your fourth reason, there as ye sayne that the ianglerye of women can hyde thinges that they wote not, as who say¦eth, that a woman can not hide that she wote Syr, these wordes ben vnderstande of wo∣men that ben ianglers and wycked, of which women men sayne that thre thynges dryuen a mā out of hys house, that is to saye, smoke droppynge of rayne, and wycked wyues. And of suche women Salomon sayeth, that a man were better dwell in deserte, then
<PB N="lxxxi" REF="93"/>
wyth a woman that is riottous. And syr by your leaue it am not I, for ye haue ful oft assayde my great sylence and my greate paci∣ence, and eke howe well that I can hyde and heale thynges that men oughten secretly to hyden. And sothly as to youre fyfth reason, where as ye saye that in wycked counsayle women venquyshe men: God wote that thylke reason stante here in no stede: for vn∣derstandeth, nowe ye asken counsayle for to do wyckednesse: And yf ye wolde werken wyckednesse, &amp; your wyfe restrayneth thylke wycked purpose, and ouercome you by rea∣son and by good counsayle, certes your wyfe oughte rather to be praysed then blamed. Thus shuld ye vnderstande the philosopher that sayeth, in wycked counsayle women venquyshe her husbandes. And there as ye blame all women and her reasons, I shall shewe you by many ensamples that manye women haue be full good, and yet bene, and her counsayle holsome and profytable. Eke some men haue sayde that the counsayle of women is eyther to dere, or to lytell worthe But all be it so that full many women bene badde, and her counsayle vyle and noughte worthe, yet han men foūde full many a good woman, and full dyscrete and wyse in coun∣saylynge. Lo Iacob through the counsayle of hys mother Rebecke, wanne the benyson of hys father, and y<SUP>e</SUP> lordshyp of all hys bre∣thren. Iudith through her good counsayle, delyuered the cyte of Bethule, in whyche she dwelt, out of the hāde of Holoferne that had it al beseged, and wolde haue dystroyed it. A∣bigayle delyuered Naball her husbande fro Dauid the kynge, that wold haue slayne him and apeased the yre of the kynge by her wyte and by her good counsayle. Hester by her coū∣sell enhaunsed greatly y<SUP>e</SUP> people of god in the raygne of Assuerus the kynge. And the same bountye in good coūsaylyng of many a good woman may men rede and tell. And further∣more when that our lorde had created Adam oure former father, he sayd in thys wyse: It is not good a man to be alone: make we an helper to hym selfe semblable. Here maye ye se that yf that women were not good, and her counsayle good and profytable, our lorde god of heuen ne wolde neither han wrought hem, ne called hem the helper of man, but ra∣ther confusyon to man.</P>
<P>And there sayde a clerke ones in two ver∣ses. What is better thē gold? Iasper. What is better then Iasper? wysedome. And what is better then wysedome? womā. And what is better then a good woman? that is a good man. And what is better then a good man? nothynge. And syr, by many other reasons maye ye sene, that many women bene good, and eke her counsayle good and profytable. And therfore syr, yf that ye woll truste to my counsayle, I shall restore you your doughter hole and sounde, and eke that I woll do you so moche, that ye shall haue honoure in thys case.</P>
<P>When Melibe had herde the wordes of hys wyfe prudence, he sayd thus. I se well that wordes of Salomon be soth. For he say¦eth, the wordes that be spoken dyscretlye by ordynaunce bene honycombes, for they yuen swetnesse to the soule, and holsomnesse to the bodye. And wyfe bycause of thy swete wor∣des, and eke for I haue proued and assayed thy greate sapience and thy greate trouthe: I woll gouerne me by thy counsayle in all thynge.</P>
<P>Nowe syr (quoth dame Prudence) and sythens that ye vouchsafe to be gouerned by my counsayle, I woll enfourme you howe that ye shall gouerne youre selfe in chosynge of your counsaylours. Ye shall fyrste in all youre werke mekelye besechynge to the hye God that he wolde be your counsaylour, and shapeth you to suche entent that he yeue you counsayle and comforte, as taught Thobye hys sonne. At all tymes thou shalte blysse God, and praye hym to dresse thy wayes, and loke eke that thy counsayles ben in hym euer more. Saynt Iames sayeth, yf anye man of you haue nede of sapience, aske it of God. And afterwarde, then shullen ye take counsayle in youre selfe, and examyne well youre owne thoughtes, of suche thynges as you thynketh that ben best for youre profyte. And then shall ye dryue frō your herte thyn∣ges that be cōtrarious to good coūsayle: that is to saye, yre, couetous, and hastynesse.</P>
<P>Fyrste he that asketh counsayle of hym selfe, certes he muste be wythouten yre and wrath in hym self for many causes. The fyrst is thys: He that hath greate yre and wrathe in him selfe, he weneth alwaye that he maye do the thynge y<SUP>t</SUP> he may not do. And secōdly,
<PB REF="94"/>
he that is yrous and wrothfull, he maye not wel deme: And he that maye not wel deme, maye not well counsell. The thyrde is thys, he that is yrous &amp; wroth, as sayeth Seneke, maye not speake but blamefull thynges, and wyth thylke vycious wordes he styreth o∣ther folke to anger and to yre. And eke syr ye muste dryue couetyse out of your herte. For the Apostle sayeth, that couetyse is the roote of all harmes. And trusteth ryght wel that a couetous man ne can not deme ne thynke but only to fulfyll the ende of hys couetyse: &amp; cer∣tes that ne maye neuer be accomplyshed, for euermore, the more aboūdaunce that he hath of rychesses, the more he desyreth. And syr, ye muste also dryue out of your herte hastynes: For certes ye maye not deme for the best a so dayne thought that falleth in your herte, but ye muste auyse you on it full ofte: For as ye haue herde here byfore, the comē prouerbe is thys. He that sone demeth, sone repenteth.</P>
<P>Syr, ye ne be not alwaye in lyke dysposi∣cion, for certes some thynge that semeth som¦tyme to you y<SUP>t</SUP> is good for to do, an other time it semeth to you the contrarye.</P>
<P>And when ye han taken counsaile in your selfe, and han demed by good delyberacion suche thynge as you semeth beste, then rede I you that ye kepe it secrete. Bewraye ye not your counsayl to no persone, but yf so be that ye wene sekerly that through youre bewray∣eng, your cōdicion shalbe to you the more pro¦fytable. For Iesus Syrack sayeth: neyther to thy foe ne to thy frende dyscouer not thy se∣crete, ne thy folye: for they wol yeue you au∣dience and lokynge, &amp; supportacion in youre presence, and scorne you in your absence. An other clerke sayth, that scarsly shal you fynde any persone that maye kepe coūsayle secretly The boke sayeth, whyle that thou kepest thy counsayle in thyne herte, thou kepest it in thy pryson: and when thou bewrayest thy coun∣sayl to any wyght, he holdeth y<SUP>t</SUP> in hys snare And therfore you is better to hyde your coū∣sayle in your herte, then to pray hym to whō ye haue bewrayed your counsayle, y<SUP>t</SUP> he woll kepe it close styl. For Seneca sayth: Yf so be y<SUP>t</SUP> thou mayst not thyne owne counsayle hyde, howe darste thou praye any other wight thy counsayle secrete to kepe. But nathelesse yf thou wene sykerly that the bewrayeng of thy counsayle to a persone woll make thy condy∣cion stonde in y<SUP>e</SUP> better plyght, then shalt thou tell hym thy counsayle in thys wyse. Fyrst thou shalte make no semblaunt whether the were leuer peace or warre, or thys or that, ne shewe hym not thy wyll ne thyne entent: for trust well that comenly these coūsaylers ben flatterers, namely the counsaylers of greate lordes, for they enforce hem alway rather to speake pleasaunt wordes, enclynynge to the lordes luste, then wordes that bene trewe or profytable, and therfore men saye y<SUP>t</SUP> the rych man hath selde good coūsayle, but yf he haue it of hym selfe. And after that thou shalt con∣syder thy frendes and thyne enemyes. And as touchynge thy frendes, thou shalte consy∣der whych of hem ben moste faythful &amp; most wyse, and eldest, and moste approued in coū∣saylynge: and of hem shalt thou aske thy coū¦sayle, as the case requyreth.</P>
<P>I saye, that fyrst ye shal call to your coun∣sayle your frendes that ben trewe. For Salo¦mon sayeth: that ryght as the herte of a man delyteth in sauoure that is sote, ryght so the counsayle of trewe frendes yeueth swetnesse to the soule. And he sayeth also, there may no thynge be lykened to the trewe frēde: For cer¦tes golde ne syluer be not so moche worth as the good wyll of a trewe frende. And also he sayeth that a trewe frende is a stronge defēce who so that it fyndeth hath a great treasure. Then shall ye also consyder yf that your true frendes be dyscrete and wyse: for the boke say¦eth, aske alwaye thy counsayle of them that ben wyse. And by thys same reason shall ye call to your counsayle your frendes that ben of age, suche as seme and ben experte in ma∣ny thynges, and ben approued in coūsaylyng For the boke sayeth, that in olde men is sapi∣ence, and in longe tyme the prudence. And Tullius sayeth, that great thynges bene not aye accomplyshed by strength ne by delyuer∣nesse of body, but by coūsayle, by auctorite of persones, and by science: the whych thre thin¦ges ne ben not feoble by age, but certes they enforce, and encrease daye by daye, and then shall ye kepe thys for a generall rule. Fyrste shall ye call to your counsayle a fewe of your frendes that ben especial. For Salomon say¦eth, many frendes haue thou, but amonge a thousande chose the one to be thy coūsaylour for al be it so that thou fyrst ne tell thy coun∣sayle but to a fewe, thou mayste afterwarde
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="94"/>
tel it to mo folke yf it be nede. But loke al∣way that thy counsaylers haue those condi∣cions that I haue sayd before, that is to saye, that they be trewe, wyse, and of olde experi∣ence. And werke not alway in euery nede by one counsayler alone: for somtyme behoueth it to be counsayled by many. For Salomon saythe, saluaciō of thynges is where as there be many counsaylers.</P>
<P>¶Nowe haue I tolde you of which folke ye shall be counsayled: Nowe wol I tel you whiche counsayle ye ought to eschue. Fyrste ye shall eschue the counsaylynge of fooles. Salomon sayth, take no counsayle of a foole for he wol counsayle but after his owne lust and hys affection. The boke saythe, that the propertie of a foole is this: He troweth light¦ly harme of euery man, and lightly troweth al bountie in him selfe. Thou shalt eschue the counsaylyng of al flatterers, which as enfor∣cē hem rather to prayse your persone by slat∣terye, than for to tell you the sothfastnesse of thynges. Wherfore, Tullius saith, amonge al the pestelencie that ben in frendshyp, the greatest is flaterye. And therfore it is more nede that thou eschue and drede flaterers, thā any other people. The boke sayth, thou shalt rather flee fro the swete wordes of flatering and praysynge, than fro the eygre wordes of thy frendes that sayth the sothes. Salomon sayth, that the wordes of a flaterer is a snare to catche innocence. He sayth also, he that spe∣keth to his frende wordes of flatery &amp; of ple∣saunce, he setteth a nette beforne hys fete to catche hym. And therfore Tullius sayth. En∣clyne not thyne eares to flatterers. And Ca∣ton saythe. Auyse the wel, and eschue y<SUP>e</SUP> wor∣des of swetnesse and of pleasaunce. And eke thou shalt eschue the counsaylynge of thyne olde enemyes that ben reconciled. The boke saythe, that no wight retourneth safely in to the grace of his olde enemy. And Esope saith ne trust not to hem, to whiche thou hast som∣tyme had werre or enemyte, ne tell hem not thy counsayle. And Seneke telleth the cause why it may not be, for he saith, there as great fyre hath longe tyme endured, y<SUP>t</SUP> there dwel∣leth some vapoure of hete. And therfore saith Salomon, in thyn olde foe trust thou neuer. For sikerly though thy enemy be reconciled and make the sygne of humilite, and lout to the with hys heed, truste hym neuer: for cer∣tes he maketh thilke fayned humylite more for hys profyte than for any humilite, or for any loue of thy person, bycause y<SUP>t</SUP> he demeth to haue victorie ouer thy persone, by suche fayned countynaunce, the whych vyctorie he myght not haue by stryfe or werre. And Pe∣trus Alphons saith, make no felowship with thyne olde enemyes, for yf thou do hem boun¦tye, they wollen peruerte it to wyckednesse. And eke thou must eschue the counsaylynge of hem that ben thy seruauntes, and beren y<SUP>e</SUP> gret reuerence: for parauenture they sayen it more for drede. than for loue. And therfore saythe a philosopher in this wyse. There is no wyght parfetly true to hym y<SUP>t</SUP> he dredeth And Tullius saith, there is no might so great of any emperour that longe may endure, but he haue loue of the people and drede. Ye shall eschue also the counsaylyng of folke that ben dronklewe, for they ne can no coūsayle hyde. For Salomon saythe, there nys no priuyte ther as reygneth dronknesse, ye shal haue also in suspecte the counsaylyng of suche folke as counsayle you one thynge priuely, and coun∣sayle you the contrary openly. For Cassidorie saith, that it is a maner sleight to hynder his enemye whan he sheweth to done a thynge openly, and werketh priuely the contrarye. Thou shalte haue also in suspecte the coun∣saylyng of wycked folke, that be alway ful of fraude. And Dauid saythe, that blisful is the man that hath not folowed the counsaylyng of shrewes.</P>
<P>Thou shalte also eschue the counsaylynge of yonge folke, for her counsaylynge is not rype, as Salomon saythe.</P>
<P>¶Nowe sir, sythens, I haue shewed you of suche folke as ye shal be counsayled of, and folowe it: nowe woll I teche you howe ye shal examyne your counsayle. After the doc∣tryne of Tullius, in examenynge of youre counsayloures, ye shall consydere manye thynges.</P>
<P>Fyrst thou shalt cōsyder thylke thyng that thou purposest, and vpon that thynge y<SUP>t</SUP> thou wolt haue counsayle, that very trouth be said and cōserued, this is to say, tel truely thy tale for he that sayth false, may not well be coun∣sayled in that case, of whiche he lyeth. After this thou shalte consyder the thynges that a∣corden to that thou purposest for to do by thy coūsaylours, if reason accorde therto, and eke
<PB REF="95"/>
yf thy might maye attayne therto, and if the more parte and the better parte of your coun¦saylours accorden therto or no. Than shalte Thou consyder what thynge shal folowe of her coūsaylinge: As hate, peace, werre, grace profyte, or damage, and many other thinges: and in al thynges thou shalte chose the beste, and weyue al other thynges. Thā shalt thou consyder of what rote is engendred the ma∣ter of thy counsayle, and what fruite it maye conceyue and engender. Thou shalt eke con∣syder al thy causes, frome whence they be spronge. And whan thou hast examyned thy counsayle, as I haue sayd, and whiche party is the better and more profytable, and haste approued it by many wyse folke &amp; olde, than thou shalt consyder, yf thou mayste performe it, &amp; make of it a good ende. For certes reson wol not that any mā shal begyn a thyng, but yf he myght performe it as hym ought, ne no wight shuld take vpon hym so heuy a charge but that he might beare it. For the prouerbe sayth, he that to moch enbraceth distrayneth lytel. And Caton saythe, assay to do such thin¦ges as thou haste power to done, leste the charge oppresse the to sore, that the behoueth weyue the thyng that thou haste begon. And yf so be that thou be in dout, whether thou mayst perfourme a thynge or none, chose ra∣ther for to suffre than to begynne. And Peter Alphons saythe, yf thou haste myght to do a thynge, of whiche thou muste repente, it is better holde thy tonge styl than for to speke. Than mayst thou vnderstonde by stronger resons, that yf thou haste power to perfour∣me a werke, of which thou shalt repente the, than is it better thou suffre than begyn. Wel sayne they that defenden euery wyght to as∣saye a thyng of which he is in doute whether he may performe it or none. And after whan ye haue examined your counsayle (as I haue sayde before) and know wel, that ye maye per¦forme your emprise: conferme it thā sadly tyl it be at an ende.</P>
<P>¶Nowe it is reason &amp; tyme that I shewe you, whan &amp; wherfore that ye maye chaunge your counsayle, wythouten reprofe. Soth∣ly a man may chaunge hys purpose and hys counsayle, yf the cause ceaseth, or whan a newe case betydeth. For the lawe sayth, that vpon thinges that newly betyden, behoueth newe counsayle. And Seneke saythe, yf thy counsayle is come to the eeres of thyne ene∣myes, chaunge thy counsayle. Thou mayste also chaunge thy coūsayle, yf so be thou fynde that by errour or by anye other cause, harme or damage may betyde. Also yf thy counsayle be dyshonest, other els come of dyshonest cause, chaunge thy counsayle. For the lawe saythe, that al behestes that be dishonest, ne ben of no value: And eke, yf so be that it be vnpossyble or may not gladly be parformed or kepte.</P>
<P>And take thys for a general rule, that eue∣ry counsayle that is enfourmed so strongly, that it may not be chaunged for no condyci∣on that may betyde, I say that ilke counsayle is wycked.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Elibeus, whan he hadde herde the doctryne of hys wife dame Prudēce answerde in thys wyse. Dame ({quod} he) as yet vnto this tyme ye han well taught me, as in gouernayle howe I shall gouerne me in the chosynge and in the wytholdynge of my counsayle: but nowe wolde I fayne y<SUP>t</SUP> ye wolde condiscende in especial, howe that ye semeth by our counsaylours that we haue chose in this present nede.</P>
<P>¶My lorde ({quod} she) I beseche you in all humblesse, that ye wol not wylfully replye ayenst my reasons, ne distemper youre herte though I speke the thynge y<SUP>t</SUP> you displese, for god wote as in myne entent, I speke it as for your beste and for your honoure and profyte eke, and sothly I hope that your benygnyte wol take it in pacience. And trusteth me wel that your counsayle in this case ne shuld not (as to speke properly) be called a counsay∣lyng, but a mocion or a mouynge of folye, in which counsayle ye haue erred in many a son¦drie wyse.</P>
<P>Fyrst ye haue erred in the assemblynge of your counsaylours: For fyrst ye shulde haue cleped a fewe folke to your counsayle, and af∣ter ye might haue shewed it to mo, yf it had be nede. But ye haue cleped to your counsayl a great multytude of people, ful chargeous and ful noyous for to here. Also ye haue er∣red, for there as ye shulde haue onely cleped to your counsayle your trewe frendes, olde and wyse, ye haue cleped straunge folke, yonge folke, false flatterers, and enemyes reconcyled, and folke that done you reuerēce

And eke ye haue erred, for ye haue brought with you to your counsayle ire couetyse, and hastynesse, the which thre thyn∣ges ben contrary to euerye good counsayle, honest and profytable, the whiche thre thyn∣ges ye haue not distroyed neyther in youre selfe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in your counsaylours, as ye ought. Ye haue erred also for ye haue shewed to your counsaylours your talent and your affectiōs to make werre anon, &amp; for to do vengeaunce, &amp; they haue espyde by your wordes, to what thyng ye ben enclyned: &amp; therfore haue they rather counsayled you to your talente, than to your profite. Ye han erred eke, for it semeth that you suffyseth to haue be counsayled by these counsailours onely, and with lytel auy∣sement, where as in so hye and in so great a nede, it had ben necessary mo counsaylours, and more delyberacion to performe your em∣prise. Ye hā erred also, for ye haue not examy∣ned your counsayle in the forsayd maters, ne in dewe maner as the case requireth.

And therfore the counsaylynges that ben at con∣gregacions and multitudes of folke, there as men take more regarde to the nomber than to the sapiēce of persons, ye sene wel, that in such counsaylinges, fooles han the maistrye.

<P>To thys sentence answereth anon dame Prudence and sayd: Examyneth ({quod} she) wel your counsayle, and let vs se whyche of hem hath spoke moste resonably, and taught you beste counsayle. And for as moche as the exa∣minacion is necessarye, lette vs begyn at sur∣gens and physiciens, that fyrst spake of thys mater. I saye that physiciens and surgiens haue sayd you in your counsayle discretly, as hem ought: and in her speche sayd ful wisely, that to the office of hem apertayneth to done to euery wight honoure and profyte, and no wyght to anoye, and after her crafte to don great dyligence vnto the cure of hem, whych they haue in her gouernaunce. And sir, right as they haue answerde wysely and discretly, right so rede I that they ben hyely and soue∣raynly guerdoned for her noble speche, &amp; eke for they shul more done theyr ententyfe besy∣nesse in the curacion of your doughter: for al be it so they ben your frendes, therfore shullē ye not suffre, that they serue you for naught, but ye ought therafter guerdō hem, and pay hem her largesse. And as touchyng the propo¦sicion, whyche the physiciens entreteden in in this case, this is to sayne, that in maladies is, that contrarie is warished by an other cō∣trarie: I wolde fayne knowe howe ye vnder¦stonde thylke texte, &amp; what is your sentence? Certes ({quod} Melibeus) I vnderstonde it in thys wyse. Right as they han do me a con∣trarye, so shulde I done hem an other, for ryght as they han venged hem vpon me, and done me wronge, ryght so woll I venge me vpon hem, and don hem wronge, and than haue I cured one contrarie by an other.</P>
<P>Lo, lo ({quod} dame Prudence) how lightly is euery man enclyned to hys owne desyre and hys owne plesaunce. Certes ({quod} she) the wor∣des of the physiciens ne shuld not ben vnder∣stonde in that wyse, for certes wyckednesse is not contrarie to wickednesse, ne vengeaunce is not contrarie to vengeaunce, ne wronge to wronge, but euery of hem encreseth &amp; engen∣dreth other. But certes y<SUP>e</SUP> wordes of the phi∣siciens shulde be vnderstonde in thys wyse, for good and wyckydnesse ben two contra∣ries: and peace and werre, vengeaunce and suffraunce, discorde and acorde, and many o∣ther thynges: But certes wyckidnesse shalbe warished with goodnes, discorde by acorde, werre by peace, and so forthe in other thyn∣ges. And therto acordeth saynt Poule the Apostel in many places: He saith, ne yeld not harme for harme, ne wicked speche for wyc∣ked speche, but do wel to hem that don to the harme, and blesse them that sayd the harme. And in manye other places he amonissheth peace and acorde.</P>
<P>But nowe wol I speke of the counsayle,
<PB REF="96"/>
whiche was lyeue vnto you by men of law, and the wyse folke and olde folke, that saydē al by one accorde as ye herde byforne, that ouer al thynges ye shal done your besynesse and dyligence to kepe youre person, and to warnstore your house: And they sayd also, y<SUP>t</SUP> in thys case ye ought to werchenfull wysely and with great delyberacion. And syr, as to the fyrste poynte, that toucheth the kepynge of your person: ye shall vnderstonde that he that hath werre, shal euer deuoutely and me∣kely prayen, byforne all thynges, that Iesu Christ of his mercy wol haue him in his pro¦tection, and to be his souerayne helper at his nede: For certes in this worlde there nys no wight that maye be counsayled and ykepte suffyciently without the kepynge of our lord Iesu Christ. To thys sentence acordeth the prophete Dauid that sayth: If god ne kept the cyte, in ydel waketh he that it kepeth. Nowe sir, than shulde he commytte the ke∣pynge of your person to youre true frendes, that ben approued and yknowe, and of hem shul ye aske helpe, your person to kepe. For Caton saith: If thou haue nede of helpe, aske it of thy frendes, for there nys none so good a physicien as thy true frende. And after this than shal ye kepe you fro al straunge folke, &amp; fro lyers, and haue alway in suspecte her cō∣panye. For Peter Alphons saythe. Ne take no company by the way of no straunge man, but yf so be that thou haste knowen hym of lenger tyme: And yf so be that he fal in to thy companye, parauenture withouten thyn as∣sent and good wyl, enquire than as subtelly as thou canst of his conuersacion, and of hys lyfe byforne, and fayne thy way, sayeng thou woldest go thyder as thou wolte not go, and yf he beare a spere, hold the on the right syde of hym, and yf he beare a swerde, hold the on the lefte syde of hym. And than shal ye kepe you wysely from all maner of such people as I haue said you here byfore, and hem and her counsayle eschue. And after this than shal ye kepe you, in suche maner, that for anye pre∣sumpsion of your bodely strength, that ye dis∣pyse not ne acounte not the might of your ad¦uersary so lyte, that ye lete the keping of your person for your presumpcion, for euery wyse mā dredeth his enemy. And Salomon saith: A very foole is he that of al hath drede: But certes he y<SUP>t</SUP> thorowe hardynesse of his herte, and through the hardynesse of him self, hath to great presumpcion, hym shall yuel betyde. Than shal ye euermore encountrewayte en∣bushementes, and all espyaile. For Seneke saythe: The wyse man that dredeth harmes, escheweth harmes: He ne falleth in to no pe∣rylles, that peryll escheweth. And al be it so that thou seme, y<SUP>t</SUP> thou be in secret place, yet shalt thou alway don dyligence in kepyng of thy person, this is to say, ne be not neglygent to kepe thyne owne person, not onely for thy greatest enemy, but also for thy leste enemy. Seneke sayth, a man that is wel aduysed, he dredeth his leste enemye. Ouyde saythe, that the lytel wesel wol slee the great bulle &amp; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wylde herte. And the prouerbe saythe, that a lytel thorne wol greue a kyng ful sore, and a lytel hounde wol holde the wylde bore. But nathelesse I say not thou shalt be so cowarde that thou doute where as is no drede. The boke saythe, that some men haue great luste to disceyue, but yet they drede to be disceyued And kepe the fro the companye of skorners: for the boke sayth, with skorners ne make no companye, but flye her wordes as venym</P>
<P>¶Nowe as to the seconde poynte, where as your wyse counsaylours counsayled you to warne store youre house with greate dely∣gence, I wolde fayne knowe howe ye vnder∣stōde thylke wordes, &amp; what is your sentēce.</P>
<P>Melibeus answerd and sayd, certes I vn∣derstonde it in this wyse, that I shal warne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> store myn house wyth toures, suche as haue castels &amp; other maner edyfices, and armurye &amp; archeries, bitwene which thynges I maye my person and my house so kepe and defende that myne enemyes shullen be in drede myne house to aproch. To this sentence answerde anon Prudence. Warnishyng ({quod} she) of hye toures &amp; of hye edyfices, is with great costa∣ges and with great trauayle, and whan that they ben accōplished, yet ben they not worth a strawe, but yf they ben defended with trew frendes, that ben olde and wyse. And vnder∣stondeth wel, that y<SUP>e</SUP> greatest and the strōgest garnyson that ryche men maye haue, as wel to kepen her parsone as her goodes is, y<SUP>t</SUP> they be byloued with her subiectes, and with her neyghbours. For thus saythe Tullius, that there is a maner garryson, that no man may venquishe ne discomfyte, and that is a lorde to be byloued of his cytezyns, &amp; of his people.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxiiii" REF="96"/>¶Nowe sir, as to the thyrde poynte, where as your olde and wyse counsaylours sayde, that ye ought not sodainly ne hastely procede in this nede▪ but that ye oughten puruayen and aparayle you in this case, with great dy∣lygence and delyberacion. Verily I trowe y<SUP>t</SUP> they sayde right trewly and ryght sothe. For Tullius sayth: In euery dede or thou begyn it, apparayle the with great dyligence. Than say I, in vengeaunce takyng, in werre, in ba∣tayle, and in warnestoryng, or thou begyn I rede that thou apparayle the therto, and do it with great delyberaciō. For Tullius saith: The longe apparelynge to fore the batayle, maketh shorte victorie. And Cassidorus saith The garryson is stronger, whan it is longe tyme auysed. But nowe let vs speke of the counsayle that was acorded by your neygh∣bours, suche as don you reuerence withoutē loue, your olde enemyes reconciled, your flat¦terers, that counsayled you certayne thyn∣ges priuely, and openly counsayled you the contrarye. The yong folke also, that counsay∣led you to venge you, &amp; to make werre anon. Certes syr, as I haue sayde byfore, ye haue greatly erred to clepe suche maner of folke to youre counsayle, whiche counsaylours ben ynoughe reproued by the resons a forsayd. But nathelesse let vs nowe discende to the special. Ye shul fyrste procede after the doc∣tryne of Tullius. Certes the trouthe of thys mater or of thys counsayle, nedeth not dyli∣gently to enquire, for it is wel wyste, which they ben that han done you this trespas and vilanye, and howe many trespasours, and in what maner they haue done al thys wronge to you, and al this vilanye. And after thys, than shul ye examyne the seconde condicion, whiche Tullius addeth in thys mater. For Tullius putteth a thyng, whiche that he cle∣peth consentyng: this is to say, who ben they and whiche ben they, and howe manye, that cōsenten to thy counsayle in thy wylfulnesse, to done hasty vengeaunce. And let vs consy∣der also who ben they, and howe manye they ben that consented to youre aduersaries. As to the fyrst poynt, it is wel knowen whiche folke they be, that cōsented to your hasty wyl¦fulnesse. For trewly al tho that counsayl you to maken sodayne werre, ne be not your fren¦des. Let se nowe whiche ben they that ye hol¦den so greatly your frēdes, as to your person For al be it so that ye be mighty &amp; rich certes ye ben but alone: for trewly ye ne haue no chyld but a doughter, ne ye haue no brethern ne cosyns germayns, ne none other nye kyn∣rede, wherfore your enemyes shuld stynte to plede with you, ne to distroye your person.</P>
<P>Ye knowe also that youre rychesse mot be dispended in dyuers parties. And whā that euery wight hath his parte, they wollen take but lytell regarde to venge your dethe. But thyne enemyes ben thre, &amp; they haue manye brethern, children, cosyns, &amp; other nye kynred &amp; though so were, that thou haddest slayne of hem two or thre, yet dwelleth ther ynowe to auenge her dethe, and to slee thy person. And though so be that your kynrede be more sted∣faste and syker than the kyn of your aduersa∣ryes, yet neuer the lesse your kynrede is but after kynrede, for they ben but lytel sybbe to you, and the kynne of your enemyes ben nye sybbe to hem. And certes as in that, her condi¦cion is better than is yours. Than let vs con¦syder also of the counsaylynge of hem that counsayled you to take sodayne vengeaunce, whether it acorde to reson or non: And certes ye know wel nay for as by ryght and reson, there maye no man take vengeaunce of no wight, but the iuge that hath iurisdiction of it, whan it is graunted hym to take venge∣aunce hastely or attemperatly, as the lawe re¦quireth. And yet more ouer of thylke worde that Tullius clepeth cōsentynge, thou shalte cōsent, yf that thy might and thy power may consente and suffyse to thy wilfulnesse, and to thy counsaylours: And certes thou mayste wel saye naye, for sykerly as for to speke pro¦perly, we may do nothyng but suche thynge as we may done ryghtfully: and certes righ∣fully ye may take no vengeaunce, as of your own propre auctorite. Than maye ye se that youre power ne consenteth not ne accordeth not with your wylfulnesse. Nowe let vs exa¦myne the thyrde poynt, that Tullius clepeth consequence. Thou shalte vnderstonde that the vengeaunce y<SUP>t</SUP> thou purposest for to take is consequent, and therof foloweth an other vengeaunce, peryl, and werre, and other da∣mages withouten nombre, of whiche we be not ware, as at this tyme. And as touchynge the fourth poynte, y<SUP>t</SUP> Tullius clepeth engen∣dring, thou shalte consyder, that this wrong, whiche that is done to the, is engendred of y<SUP>e</SUP>
<PB REF="97"/>
hate of thyne enemyes, and of y<SUP>e</SUP> vengeaunce takyng vpon hem, that wolde engender a no¦ther vengeaunce, and mochel sorowe &amp; wa∣styng of rychesse, as I sayde ere. Nowe sir, as touchyng the fylte poynte, that Tully cle∣peth causes, whiche is the laste poynte, thou shalte vnderstonde, that the wronge that thou haste receyued, hathe certayne causes, whiche that clerkes callen orien, and efficien, and causa longinqua, and causa propinqua, that is to saye, the ferre cause, and the nyghe cause. The ferre cause is almyghty God, that is cause of al thynges. The nere cause is the thre enemyes. The cause accidental was hate. The cause material, ben the fyue woun¦des of thy doughter. The cause formal, is the maner of theyr werkynge that brought lad∣ders, and clambe in at thy wyndowes. The cause fynal was for to sle thy doughter, it let¦ted not in as moche as in them was. But for to speke of y<SUP>u</SUP> ferre cause, as to what ende they shulde come, or fynally what shal betyde of them in thys case, ne canne I not deme, but by coniectynge and supposynge: for we shall suppose that they shall come to a wycked ende, bycause that the boke of decrees saythe. Selde or wyth greate payne, ben causes brought to a good ende, whan they ben bad∣ly begonne.</P>
<P>Now sir, yf men wolde aske me why that god suffred men to do you this villanye, tru∣ly I can not wel answere, as for no sothfast∣nesse. For the Apostel saythe, that the scyen∣ces and the iugementes of our lorde God al∣mighty ben ful depe, there may no man com∣prehende ne serche hem. Nathelesse by cer∣tayne presumpcyous and coniectynges, I holde and byleue, that God whyche that is ful of iustyce and of rightwisnesse, hathe suf∣fred thys betyde, by iuste cause resonable.</P>

Thou haste dronke so moche hony of swete temporel rychesses, and delyces of honours of this worlde, that thou arte dronke, and haste forgoten Iesu Christ thy creatour: Thou ne haste not done to hym suche honoure and reuerence as the ought, ne thou ne haste not taken kepe to the wordes of Ouide, that sayth. Vnder y<SUP>e</SUP> hony of the goodes of thy body, is hyd the venym that sleeth thy soule.</P>
<P>And Salomon sayth: If it so he that thou hast founde hony, eete of the same hony, that that suffyseth: For yf so be that thou eete of y<SUP>e</SUP> same hony out of mesure, thou shalte spewe, and also be nedy and poore. And parauen∣ture almyghty God Iesu Christ, hath the in dispyte, and hathe turned awaye fro the hys face, and his eeres of myserycorde &amp; mercye. And also he hath suffred &amp; gyue lycence, that thou thus shuldest be punished &amp; chastised, in y<SUP>e</SUP> maner that thou haste trespased and offen∣ded. Thou hast done synne agaynst our lorde Christ, for certes the thre enemyes of man∣kynde, that is to say: the fleshe, the fende, and the worlde, thou haste suffred hem entre into thyne herte wylfully, by the wyndowes of thy body, and hast not defended thy selfe suf∣fyciently agaynst their assautes &amp; their temp¦tacions, so that they haue wounded thy soule in fyue places, this is to shy: The deedly syn∣nes, that ben entred in to thy hert by thy fyue wyttes. And in the same maner oure lorde Christ hathe wolde and suffred that thy thre enemyes bē entred in to thy house by y<SUP>e</SUP> wyn∣dowes, and haue wounded thy doughter in the forsayd maner.</P>
<P>Truely ({quod} Melibee) I se well that ye en∣force you moche by wordes to ouercome me, in suche maner that I shall not venge me on myn enemyes, shewynge me the perilles and the yuels that myght fal of this vengeaunce but who so wolde consyder in al vengeaun∣ces, the perils and yuels that myght s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of vengeaunce takyng, a man wolde neuer take vengeaunce, and that were harme: For by y<SUP>e</SUP> vengeaunce takynge, ben the wycked men disceuered from the good men. And they that haue wyll to do wickednesse, restrayn theyr wycked purpose, whan they se the ponishyng and chastysyng of y<SUP>e</SUP> trespasours: And yet say I more, that ryght as a synguler person syn∣neth in takynge vengeaunce of a nother m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, ryght so synneth the iuge, yf he do no venge∣aūce of hem that haue deserued. For Seneke saythe thus: That mayster he saythe is good that preueth shrewes. And as Cassyodor saythe: A man dredeth to do outrages, whan he wote and knoweth, that it dyspleaseth to the iuges &amp; soueraynes. And an other saythe: The iuge that dredeth to do ryght maketh men shrewes. And saynt Poule the Apost∣le saythe in hys Epystle, whan he wryteth vnto the Romayns, that the iuges beare not
<PB N="lxxxv" REF="97"/>
the speere wythout cause, but they beare it to punyshe the shrewes &amp; mysdoers, &amp; for to de∣fende the good men. ¶Yf ye woll then take vengeaunce of your enemies, ye shul returne and haue your recourse to the iuge that hath the iurisdyction vpon hem, and he shall pu∣nyshe hem, as the lawe asketh and requyreth</P>
<P>A ha, sayd Melibee, thys vēgeaūce lyketh me nothynge. I bethynke me nowe, and take hede howe that fortune hathe nouryshed me fro my childhode, and hath holpe me to passe many a stronge paas: Nowe I woll assaye her, trowynge wyth goddes helpe, that she shall helpe me my shame for to auenge.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Ruely said Prudēce, yf ye wol werke by my counsayle, ye shal not assay for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne by no waye: ne ye shall not lene or bowe vnto her, after the worde of Senek For thynges that bene foolyshlye done, and that bene done in hope of fortune, shal neuer come to good ende. And as the same Seneke sayeth: The more clere &amp; the more shynynge that fortune is, the more brytel and the soner broke she is. Trusteth not in her, for she is not stedfast ne stable. For when thou trowest to be moste sure and stedfaste of her helpe, she woll fayle and dysceyue the. And where as ye saye, that fortune hath nouryshed you fro youre chyldhode, I saye that in so moche ye shall the lesse truste in her, and in her wytte. For Seneke sayeth: what man that is nory¦shed by fortune, she maketh him a great foole Nowe then syth ye desyre and aske vēgeaūce and the vengeaunce that is done after the lawe, and before the iuge, ne lyketh you not and the vengeaunce that is done in hope of fortune is peryllous &amp; vncertaine, then haue ye none other remedye, but for to haue your recourse vnto the soueraine iuge, that vēgeth all vylanyes and wronges. And he shal vēge you, after that hym selfe wytnesseth, where as he sayeth: Leaue the vengeaunce to me, and I shall do it.</P>
<P>Melibee answered, yf I ne venge me of the villany that men haue done to me, I sōm¦mō or warne hem, that haue done to me that vyllanye, and al other, to do me an other vyl∣lanye. For it is wrytten: Yf thou take no vengeaūce of an olde vyllany, thou sōmonest thyne aduersaryes to do the a newe vyllany: And also for my suffraūce men wolde do me so moche vyllany, that I myght neither bere it ne sustayne it, and so shulde I be put &amp; hol∣den ouer lowe. For men sayne, in mykel suffe¦ryng shal many thynges fal vnto the, which thou shalt not mowe suffre.</P>
<P>Certes ({quod} Prudence) I graunt you, that ouer moch suffraunce is not good, but yet ne foloweth it not therof, that euery persone, to whome men do vyllanye, shulde take of it vē¦geaunce: for that appertayneth and longeth all only to iuges, for they shulde venge y<SUP>e</SUP> vyl¦lanyes and iniuryes: And therfore those two authorities that ye haue sayd afore, bene on∣ly vnderstande in the iuges: For when they suffre ouer moche the wrōges and vyllanyes to be done, wythout punyshment, they som∣mon not a man all only for to do newe wron¦ges, but they cōmaunde it. Also a wyse man sayeth, that the iuge that correcteth not y<SUP>e</SUP> syn¦ner, cōmaundeth and byddeth hym do synne. And y<SUP>e</SUP> iuges and souerayns, myght in theyr lande so moch suffre of the shrewes &amp; mysdo¦ers, that they shulde by such suffraūce, by pro¦cesse of tyme, wexe of such power and myght that they shulde put out the iuges and the so∣ueraynes frō theyr places, and at laste, make hem lese her lordshyppes.</P>
<P>But let vs now suppose, that ye haue leue to venge you: I saye ye be not of myght and power as nowe to venge you, for yf ye woll make comparyson vnto the myghte of youre aduersaryes, ye shulde fynde in many thyn∣ges that I haue shewed you er thys, y<SUP>t</SUP> theyr condicyon is better then yours, and therfore saye I, that it is good as nowe, that ye suffre and be pacient.</P>
<P>Furthermore, ye knowe well that after the cōmen sawe, it is a woodnesse, a man to stryue wyth a stronger or a more mighty mā then he is hym selfe, and for to stryue wyth a man of euen strength, that is to saye, wyth as stronge a man as he is, it is peryl: and for to stryue wyth a weaker man, it is folye, and therfore shulde a man slye stryuynge as my∣kel as he myght. For Salomon sayeth: It is a great worshyppe to a man to kepe hym fro noyse &amp; stryfe: and yf it so befal &amp; happe that a man of greater myght &amp; strength then thou arte, do the greuaūce: study and besye the ra∣ther to styll the same greuaunce, then for to venge the. For Seneke sayeth, that he put∣teth hym in great peryll, that stryueth wyth
<PB REF="98"/>
a greater man than he is hem selfe. And Ca∣ton sayth, yf a man of hygher astate or degre or more mighty than thou, do the anoye or greuaunce, suffre hym: for he that ones hath greued the, maye an other tyme releue the and helpe the. Yet sette I case ye haue lycence for to venge you. I saye that there ben ful ma¦ny thynges, that shal restrayne you of venge¦aunce takyng, and make you for to enclyne to suffre, and for to haue pacience in the wron∣ges that haue ben done to you. Fyrst and for∣mest yf ye wol consyder the fautes that ben in your owne person, for whyche fautes god hath suffred you to haue this trybulacion, as I haue sayd to you here before. For the poete saythe, that we ought paciently take the try∣bulacions that come to vs, whan that we thynke and consyder that we haue deserued to haue them. And saynt Gregorie saythe, that whan a man consydereth wel the nom∣bre of hys defautes and of hys synnes, the paynes and the trybulacions that he suffreth seme the lesse vnto hym. And in as moche as him thynketh his synnes more heuy and gre∣uous, in so moche semeth his payne the ligh∣ter and the esyer vnto him. Also ye owe to en∣clyne and bowe your herte to take the paci∣ence of our lorde Iesu Christ, as sayth saynt Peter in his epystles. Iesu Christ he saythe hath suffred for vs, and yeuen ensample to euerye man to folowe and sewe hym, for he dyd neuer synne, ne neuer came there a villay¦nous worde out of hys mouthe. Whan men cursed hym, he cursed hem not. And whan men bete hym, he manaced hem not. Also the great pacience, whyche sayntes that ben in paradyse haue had in tribulacyon that they haue suffred, wythout her deserte or gylte, ought moche styrre you to pacience. Ferther∣more, ye shul enforce you to haue pacience, cō¦sydryng that the trybulacions of thys world but lytel whyle endure, and sone passed ben and gon, and y<SUP>e</SUP> ioy that a man seketh to haue by pacience in tribulacions is perdurable, af¦ter that the Apostle saythe in his Epystle. The ioye of god he sayth, is perdurable, that is to saye, euerlastyng. Also troweth and by∣leueth stedfastly that he is not wel nourished and wel taught, that can not haue pacience, or wol not receyue pacyence. For Salomon saythe, that the doctryne and the wytte of a man is knowen by pacience. And in an other place he sayth, that he that is pacient, gouer∣neth hym by great prudence.</P>
<P>And the same Salomon saythe. The an∣gry and wrathful man maketh noyses, and the pacient mā attempreth and stylleth hem. He saythe also, it is more worth to be pacient than to be ryght stronge. And he that maye haue the lordeship of his owne herte is more to prayse, thā he that by his force or strength taketh great cyties. And therfore sayth saynt Iame in hys epystle that pacyence is a great vertue of perfectyon.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Ertes ({quod} Melibee) I graunt you dame Prudence, that pa∣cience is a great vertue of per¦fection, but euerye man maye not haue the perfection that ye seke, ne I am not of the nō∣bre of ryght perfyte men. For myn herte may neuer be in peace, vnto the tyme it be auen∣ged. And al be it so that it was great peryl to myne enemyes to do me a villanye, in taking vengeaunce vpon me, yet toke they no hede of the peryl, but fulfylled her wycked wyll &amp; her corage: And therfore me thynketh men ought not repreue me, though I put me in a lytel peryl, for to auenge me, &amp; though I do a great excesse, that is to saye: that I venge one outrage by an other.</P>
<P>¶Ah ({quod} dame) Prudence, ye say your wyl as you lyketh: But in no case of the worlde a man shulde not do outrage ne excesse for to venge him. For Cassiodor sayth, that as yuel dothe he that vengeth him by outrage, as he that dothe the outrage. And therfore ye shal venge you after the order of right, that is to saye, by the lawe, and not by excesse ne by outrage. And also yf you wol venge you of the outrage of your aduersaries in other ma∣ner than right commaundeth, ye synne. And therfore saythe Seneke: that a man shal ne∣uer venge shreudnesse by shreudnesse. And yf ye saye that right asketh to defende violence by violence, and fightyng by fighting: certes ye saye soth, whan the defence is done with∣out interual, or without taryeng or delay, for to defende hym, and not for to venge hym. And it behoueth that a man put suche attem∣peraūce in his defence, that mē haue no cause ne mater to repreue him y<SUP>t</SUP> defendeth hym of
<PB N="lxxxvi" REF="98"/>
outrage and excesse, for els were it agayne re¦son. Parde ye knowe wel, that ye make no de¦fence as nowe, for to defende you, but for to venge you: and so sheweth it that ye haue no wyll to do your dede attemperatly, and ther∣fore me thynketh that pacience is good. For Salomon sayeth, that he that is not pa∣cient shall haue great harme.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Ertes sayd Melibee I graūt you, that when a mā is impa¦cient &amp; wroth of that that tou¦cheth him not, and that apper¦taineth not vnto him, though it harme hym it is no wonder For the lawe sayth, that he is culpable, that entremetleth or meteth wyth suche thynges as apertayneth not vnto hym. And Salomō sayeth▪ that he that entremetleth of the noyse or stryfe of another man, is lyke to hym that taketh a straunge hounde by the ceres: For ryght as he, that taketh a straūge hoūde by y<SUP>e</SUP> ceres, is other whyle byttē by y<SUP>e</SUP> honde, right so in the same wyse it is reason that he haue harme that by hys impacience medleth hym of the noyse of an other man, where as it ap∣pertayneth not vnto hym. But ye knowe wel that thys dede, that is to saye my grefe &amp; my dysease, toucheth me ryght nyghe. And ther∣fore though I be wrothe and impacient, it is no maruayle: and sauynge youre grace I can not se y<SUP>t</SUP> it myght greatly harme me thoughe I toke vengeaunce, for I am rycher &amp; more myghtye then myne enemyes be: And well knowe ye that by money &amp; by hauynge great possessyons, ben all thynges of thys worlde gouerned. And Salomō sayeth, al these thyn¦ges obey to money.</P>
<P>When Prudence had herde her husbande auaunt hym of hys rychesse and hys money, dyspraysynge y<SUP>e</SUP> power of hys aduersaryes, she spake and sayd in thys wyse. Certes dere syr, I graunt you that ye be ryche &amp; myghty, and that y<SUP>e</SUP> rychesse is good to hem that haue well gotten hem, and that well can vse hem. For ryght as the body of a man may not lyue wythout the soule, no more may it lyue with out the temporel goodes, and by ryches may a man get hym great frendes. And therfore sayeth Pamphillus: Yf a nerthes doughter he sayth be riche, she may chefe of a thousand men, whyche she woll take to her husbande: for of a thousande, one woll not forsake her ne refuse her. And thys Pamphillus sayeth also: Yf thou be ryght happy, that is to say, yf thou be ryche, thou shalte fynde a greate nombre of felowes &amp; frendes. And yf thy for¦tune chaūge, farewel frendshyp, &amp; felowshyp for thou shalte be alone wythout any cōpany but yf it be the companye of poore folke. And yet sayeth thys Pamphillus more ouer that they that bene bonde and thrall of ly∣nage, shall be made worthye and noble by the rychesses. And ryghte so as by the ry∣chesses there come many goodnesses, ryghte so by pouertie come there many harmes and yuels, for greate pouertie cōstrayneth a man to do many yuels. And therfore calleth Cas∣siodor pouertye the mother of ruyne, that is to saye, the mother of ouerthrowynge or of fallynge downe. And therfore sayeth Peter Alfonce: One of the greatest aduersyties of thys worlde is when a free man by kynde or of byrth, is constrayned by pouerty to eat the almesse of hys enemye. And the same sayeth Innocent, in one of hys bokes: He sayeth, that sorowfull and myshappy is the condici∣on of a poore begger, for yf he aske not hys meate, he dyeth for honger, and yf he aske, he dyeth for shame: and algates necessite con∣strayneth hym to aske. And therfore sayeth Salomon, that better is to dye, then for to haue suche pouerte. And as the same Salo∣mon sayeth: Better it is to dye of bytter deth, then for to lyue in suche wyse. By these rea∣sons that I haue said vnto you, &amp; by many o∣ther reasons that I coulde say, I graunt you that rychesses ben good, to hem y<SUP>t</SUP> getten hem well, and to hem that wel vsen tho rychesses And therfore wol I shewe you howe ye shal behaue you in gatherynge of rychesses, and in what maner ye shullen vse hem.</P>
<P>Fyrst ye shall get hem wythout great de∣syre, by good leyser, sokynglye and not ouer∣hastelye, for a man that in to desyrynge to get rychesse, habandoneth hym fyrste to thefte and to all other yuels. And therfore sayeth Salomon: He that hasteth hym to besely to waxe ryche, he shall be none innocent. He say¦eth also, that the rychesse that hastely cometh to a man, sone and lyghtly goeth and passeth from a man, but that rychesse that cometh ly∣tel &amp; lytel, wexeth alwaye and multiplyeth. And syr, ye shall gette rychesse by your wyte
<PB REF="99"/>
and by your trauayle, vnto your profyte, and that wythout wronge or harme doynge to a∣ny other persone. For the lawe sayeth, there maketh no mā him selfe riche, yf he do harme to an other wyght, thys is to say: that nature defendeth and forbyddeth by ryghte, that no man make hym selfe ryche vnto the harme of an other person. And Tullius sayeth, that no sorowe ne no drede of death, ne nothing that maye fall vnto a man, is so moche ayenst na∣ture, as a man to encreace hys owne profyte, to the harme of an other mā. And though the great &amp; myghty mē get rychesses more lyght∣ly then thou, yet shalte thou not be ydell ne slowe to do thy profyte, for thou shalte in all wyse flye ydelnesse. For Salomon sayeth, y<SUP>e</SUP> ydelnesse teacheth a man to do many yuels. And the same Salomon sayeth, that he that trauayleth and besyeth hym to tylth his lāde shall eate breed: but he that is ydell &amp; casteth hym to no besynesse ne occupacion, shal fal in to pouerte and dye for honger. And he that is ydell and slowe, can neuer fynde couenable tyme for to do hys profyte. For there is a ver¦syfyer sayeth, that the ydel man excuseth him in wynter, bycause of the greate colde, and in sommer bycause of the heete. For these cau∣ses sayeth Caton, waketh and enclyne you net ouer moche for to slepe, for ouer moche reste nourysheth and causeth many vyces. And therfore sayeth saynt Ierom, do some good dedes, that the deuell whyche is our enemye, ne fynde you not vnoccupyed, for the dyuel ne taketh not lyghtly vnto his wer kynge suche as he fyndeth occupyed in good werkes.</P>
<P>Then thus, in gettynge rychesses ye must flye ydelnesse. And afterward ye shul vse the rychesses, whyche ye haue gote by your wyte and by youre trauayle, in suche maner, that men holde you not to scarce ne to sparyng, ne foole large, that is to say, ouer large a spēder For ryghte as men blame an auaricious mā bycause of hys scarcite and chynchery, in the same wyse is he to blame that spendeth ouer largelye. And therfore sayeth Caton: Vse (sayeth he) the rychesses that thou haste got∣ten in suche maner, that men maye haue no mater ne cause to call the nother wretche ne chynche: For it is greate shame to a man to haue a poore herte and a ryche purse. He sayeth also, the goodes that thou haste gote, vse them by measure, that is to saye, spende mesurably, for they that foolyshly waste and dyspende the goodes that they haue, when they haue no more propre of her owne, then they shape hem to take y<SUP>e</SUP> goodes of an other man. I saye then that ye shall flye auaryce, vsynge youre rychesse in suche maner, that men saye not that youre rychesses bene bury∣ed, but that ye haue hem in your myghte and in youre weldynge. For a wyse man repre∣ueth the auaricyous man, and sayeth thus in thys verses two. Wherto and why buryeth a man hys goodes by hys great auaryce, and knoweth well that nedes he muste dye, for death is the ende of euerye man▪ as in thys presente lyfe? And for what cause or enche∣son ioyneth he hym, or knytteth he hym so faste vnto hys goodes, that all hys wyttes mowe not dysceuer hym, ne departe hym fro hys goodes, and knoweth well, or ought to knowe, that when he is deade, he shall no∣thynge beare wyth hym out of thys worlde. And therfore sayeth saynt Augustyne, that the auaricyous mā is lykened vnto hell, that the more it swaloweth, the more desyre it hathe to swalowe and deuoure. And as well as ye wolde eschewe to be called an a∣uaricyous man or chynche, as well shulde ye kepe and gouerne you in such a wyse, that men call you not foole large. Therfore sayeth Tullius. The goodes of thyne house ne shulde not be hydde ne kepte so close, but that they myghte be opened by pyte and de∣bonayrte, that is to saye, to yeue hem parte that haue greate nede. Ne thy goodes shulde not be so open, to be euerye mans goodes. Afterwarde in gettynge of youre rychesses and in vsynge hem, ye shall alwaye haue thre thynges in youre herte, that is to say, our Lorde God, conscience, and good name. Fyrst ye shall haue god in your herte, and for no ryches ye shuld do any thyng, whych may in any maner dysplease god your creatour &amp; maker. For after the worde of Salomon, it is better to haue a lytell good with y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of god, then to haue moche good and treasoure, and lese the loue of his Lorde God. And the prophete sayeth, that better it is to be a good man, and haue lytel good &amp; treasour, then to be holden a shrewe, and haue great rychesse. And yet I say furthermore, that ye shulde al¦waye do your busynesse to get you rychesses,
<PB N="lxxxvii" REF="99"/>
so that ye get hem with good conscience. And the Apostle sayeth, that there nys thynge in thys worlde, of whyche we shulde haue so great ioye, as when oure conscience beareth vs good wytnesse. And the wyse man sayeth: that the substaunce of a man is full good, when synne is not in mans conscience. After∣warde in gettyng of your rychesses and in v∣synge of hem, ye muste haue great besynesse and great diligence, that your good name be alwaye kept and conserued. For Salomon sayeth, that better it is, and more it auayleth a man to haue a good name, then for to haue many rychesses: And therfore he sayth in an other place. Do great diligence sayeth Salo¦mon, in kepynge of thy frendes &amp; of thy good name, for it shall lenger abyde wyth the thē any treasure, be it neuer so precious. And cer∣tes he shuld not be called a great gentylman, that after God and good conscience, all thyn∣ges lefte, ne doth hys deligence &amp; besynesse to kepe hys good name. And Cassyodor sayeth, that it is a sygne of a gentyll herte, when a mā loueth and desyreth to haue a good name And therfore sayeth saynte Augustyne, that there ben two thynges that ben ryght neces∣sarye and also nedefull: and that is good con¦science, and good lose, that is to saye: good cō¦science to thyne owne persone inwarde, and good lose for thy neyghbour outwarde. And he that trusteth hym so moch in hys good cō∣science, that he dyspyseth &amp; setteth at nought his good name or loose, &amp; recketh not though he kepe not hys good name, nys but a cruell churle. Syr, nowe haue I shewed you howe ye shulde do in gettynge rychesses, and howe ye shulde vse hem: and I se well for the trust that ye haue in your rychesses, ye woll moue warre and batayle. I counsayle you that ye begyn no warre in truste of youre rychesses, for they ne suffyse not warres to maynteyne. And therfore sayeth a philosopher: That mā that desyreth and wolde algates haue warre shall neuer haue suffysaunce: for the rycher that he is, the greater dyspēces must he make yf he woll haue worshyppe and vyctorye. And Salomon sayeth, that the greater ry∣chesses y<SUP>t</SUP> a man hath, the more dyspendours he hath. And therfore syr, all be it so that for youre ryches ye maye haue moche folke, yet behoueth it not, ne it is not good to begynne warre, where as ye maye in other maner haue peace, vnto youre worshyppe and pro∣fyte: For the vyctorye of batayls that bene in thys worlde, lyeth not in great nombre or multytude of people, ne in the vertue of mā, but it lyeth in the wyll and in the hande of oure Lorde God almyghtye. And therfore Iudas Machabeus, whyche was goddes knyght, when he shulde fyght ayenst hys ad∣uersarye, that hadde a greater nombre and a greater multytude of folke, and strōger then was hys people of Machabee, yet he recom∣forted hys lytell company, and sayd ryght in thys wyse: Also lyghtly sayd he, maye our Lorde God yeue vyctorye to a fewe folke, as to many folke, for the vyctorye of a batayle cometh not by the greate nombre of people, but it cōmeth from oure Lorde God of hea∣uen. And dere syr, for as moche as there is no man certayne, yf it be worthye that God yeue hym vyctorye or not, after that Salo∣mon sayeth, therfore euery man shuld great∣lye drede warres to begyn: and bycause that in batayles fall many peryls, and happeth o∣ther whyle, that as sone is the greate man slayne as the lytel man. And as it is wrytten in the seconde boke of kynges: The dedes of batayles ben aduenturous and nothyng cer∣tayne, for as lyghtlye is one hurte wyth a speere as an other: And for ther is great pe∣ryll in warre, therfore shulde a man slye and eschue warre in as moch as a man may good¦ly. For Salomō sayeth, he that loueth peryl, shall fall in peryll.</P>
<P>After that dame Prudence had spoken in thys maner, Melibe answered and sayd. I se well dame Prudence, that by your fayre wor¦des and your resons that ye haue shewed me that the warre lyketh you nothynge, but I haue not yet herde youre counsayle howe I shall do in thys nede.</P>
<P>Certes (said she) I coūsayle you that ye ac¦corde wyth your aduersaries, &amp; that ye haue peace wyth hem. For saynt Iames sayeth in hys Epystle: that by concorde and peace small ryches waxe great: and by debate and dyscorde ryches decaye. And ye knowe well, that one of the greatest and moste souerayne thyng that is in this worlde, is vnite &amp; peace And therfore sayeth oure lorde Iesu Christe to hys apostles, in thys wyse: wel happy ben they, that loue &amp; purchace peace, for they be called the chyldren of god. Ah, sayd Melibee,
<PB REF="100"/>
now se I wel, that ye loue not myne honour ne my worshyp. Ye knowe wel that myne ad¦uersaryes haue begon this debate &amp; bryge by theyr outrage. And ye se well that they ne re∣quyre ne praye me of peace, ne they aske not to be reconsiled. Wol ye then that I go meke me, and obey me to them, &amp; crye hem mercye? Forsoth y<SUP>t</SUP> were not my worshyp. For ryghte as men saye, ouer great humblenesse engen∣dreth dyspraysynge, so fareth it by to great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> humilite or mekenesse.</P>
<P>Then began dame Prudence to make sem¦blant of wrath, &amp; sayd: Certes syr, saue your grace. I loue your honour and profyte as I do myne owne, and euer haue do: ye ne none other neuer se the cōtrary. And yet, yf I had said, that ye shulde haue purchased peace and reconsiliation, I ne had moche mystake me, ne sayd amysse. For the wyse man sayeth: the dyscention begynneth by an other man, and the reconsylynge begynneth by thy selfe. And the prophete sayeth: flye shreudnesse, and do goodnesse, seke peace &amp; folowe it, in as moch as in the is. Yet saye I not, that ye shulde ra∣ther pursue to youre aduersaries for peace, then they shulde to you: For I knowe well that ye bene so harde herted, that ye woll do nothynge for me. And Salomon sayeth: He that hath ouer harde an herte, he at laste shal myshappe or mysbetyde.</P>
<P>When Melibee had herde dame Pru∣dence make semblaunt of wrathe, he sayde in thys wyse. Dame I praye you, that ye be not dyspleased of y<SUP>e</SUP> thynge that I saye, for ye knowe well that I am angrye and wroth, &amp; that is no wonder: and they that be wrothe wote not well what they do, ne what they saye. Therfore the prophete sayeth: that trou¦bled eyen haue no clere syght. But saye &amp; coū¦sayle me as you lyketh, for I am ready to do ryght as ye wol desyre: And yf ye reprefe me of my folye, I am the more holden to loue &amp; prayse you. For Salomō sayeth, that he that repreueth hym that doth foly, he shall fynde greater grace then he that dysceyueth him by swete wordes.</P>
<P>Then sayde dame Prudence, I make no semblaunt of wrath ne of anger, but for your great profyte. For Salomon sayeth: He is more worth, that repreueth or chydeth a fole for hys folye, shewynge hym semblaunt of wrath, then he that supporteth him and pray¦seth hym in hys mysdoynge, and laugheth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hys folye. And thys same Salomon sayeth afterwarde: That by the sorowfull vysage of a man, that is to saye, by the sorye and he∣uy countenaunce of a man, the foole correc∣teth and amendeth hym selfe.</P>
<P>Then sayde Milibee, I shall not con an∣swere vnto so many fayre reasons as ye put to me and shewe: saye shortly your wyl and youre counsayle, and I am all readye to per∣forme and fulfyll it. ¶Then dame prudence dyscouered all her wyll vnto hym and sayde. I counsayle you (sayd she) aboue al thynges, that ye make peace bytwene God and you, and be reconsyled vnto hym and to hys grace for as I haue sayd you here before, god hath suffred you to haue thys tribulation and dys∣ease for your synnes: and yf ye do as I saye you, God wyl sende youre aduersaryes vnto you, and make hem fall at your fete, ready to do youre wyll and your commaundement. For Salomon sayeth, when the condicion of man is pleasaūt and lykynge to god, he chaū¦geth the hertes of the mans aduersaries, and constrayneth hem to beseche hym of peace &amp; of grace. And I praye you let me speke with your aduersaryes priuelye, for they shal not knowe that it be of your wyll or your assent. And then when I knowe theyr wyll and theyr entente, I maye counsayle you the more surely.</P>
<P>Dame sayde Melibee, dothe youre wyll and your lykynge, for I put me holy in your dysposicion and ordynaunce.</P>
<P>Then dame Prudence, when she sawe the good wyll of her husbonde, delybered &amp; toke aduyse in her selfe, thynkyng how she myght brynge thys nede vnto a good conclusion and to a good ende: And when she sawe her tyme, she sente for these aduersaries to come vnto her in a priue place. And shewed wisely vnto hem y<SUP>e</SUP> great goodes that come of peace and the greate harmes and peryls that bene in warre, and sayd to hem in a goodly maner howe that hem ought haue great repentaūce of the iniury and wronge, that they had done to Melibeus her lorde, and vnto her and to her doughter.</P>
<P>And when they herde y<SUP>e</SUP> goodly wordes of dame Prudence, they were so supprysed and rauyshed, and had so great ioye of her, that wonder was to tel. ¶Ah, ladye (sayde they)
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="100"/>
ye haue shewed vnto vs the blessyng of swet∣nesse after the sayeng of Dauid the prophete, For the reconsyling which we be nat worthy to haue in no manere. But we ought require it with great cōtricion and humilite, that ye of your goodnesse haue presented vnto vs. Now se we wel, that the science and cōnyng of Salomon is ful trewe, for he saith: That swete wordes multiply and encreace fren∣des, and maketh shrewes to be debonaire and meke.</P>
<P>Certes (sayd they) we put our dede and al our mater &amp; cause, al holy in your goodwyl, and been redy to obey at the cōmaundement of oure lorde Melibeus. And therfore dere and benygne lady: we praye and beseche you as mekely as we can and maye, that it lyke vnto your great goodnesse, to fulfyll in dede, your goodly wordes. For we consyder and knowe, that we haue offended and greued oure lorde Melibeus out of measure: so for∣forth, that we be nat of power to make hym amendes. And therfore we oblige and bynde vs and our frendes, for to do all at hys wyll and commaundement: but parauenture he hath suche heuynesse, and suche wrathe to vs warde, bycause of our offence, that he woll enioyn vs suche a payne, as we mowe nat beare ne sustayne. And therfore noble lady, we besech your womanly pyte, to take suche aduysement in thys nede, that we ne our frē∣des be nat disherited ne distroyed, through our foly.</P>
<P>Certes (sayd Prudence) It is an harde thynge and ryght perilous, that a man put him al vtterly in arbytration and iugement, and in the might and power of hys enemye: For Salomon saythe: leueth me, and yeueth credence to that I shal saye: Ne yeueth neuer the power ne gouernaunce of thy goodes, to thy son, to thy wyfe, to thy frende, ne to thy brother: ne yeue thou neuer might ne mastry ouer thy body while thou liuest. Nowe, syth he defendeth that a man shulde nat yeue to his brother ne to his frende, the might of his body. By a stronger reason he defendeth and forbedeth a man to yeue hym selfe to his ene∣my. And nathelesse I counsaile you that ye mystrust nat my lorde: for I wot wel and know verily, that he is debonair &amp; meke, lar∣ge, curteys, and nothynge desirous ne coui∣tous of goodes ne ryches. For there is no∣thynge in this worlde that he desyreth, saue onely worshyp and honoure. Ferthermore I knowe, and am ryght sure, that he shal no∣thyng do in thys nede, without my coūsayle: and I shall so worke in thys case, that by the grace of our lorde god, ye shalbe reconsyled vnto vs.</P>
<P>Than sayd they with one voyce, worshyp∣ful lady we put vs and oure goodes all fully in your wyl and disposycion, and ben redy to come, what day that it lyketh vnto your no∣blesse to lymyte vs or assyne vs for to make our oblygacion &amp; bonde as stronge as it ly∣keth vnto your goodnes, that we mowe ful∣fyl the wyl of you and of my lorde Melibe.</P>
<P>Whan dame Prudence had herde the an∣swere of these men, she bad hem go ayen pri∣uely, and she returned to her lorde Melibe, &amp; tolde hym howe she founde hys aduersaries ful repentaunt, knowlegynge ful lowly her synnes and trespas, and how they were redy to suffre al payne, requiryng and prayīg him of mercy and pyte.</P>
<P>Than sayde Melibe, he is wel worthy to haue pardon and foryeuenesse of hys synne, that excuseth not hys synne, but knowlegeth and repenteth hym, askyng indulgynce. For Seneke sayth, there is the remission and for yeuenesse, where as the confessyon is: for confessyon is neyghbour to innocence. And therfore I assent and confyrme me to haue peace, but it is good that we do nought w<SUP>t</SUP>out the assente and wyl of our frendes.</P>
<P>Than was Prudence ryght gladde and ioyful, and sayde: Certes sir, ye haue wel and goodly answered: for ryght as by the coun∣sayle, assent, and helpe of your frendes, ye ha∣ue be steered to venge you and make werre: Right so, without her counsayle shall ye not accorde you, ne haue peace with your aduer∣saries. For the lawe sayth: There is no∣thyng so good, by waye of kynde, as a thyng to be vnbounde by him that it was ybounde.</P>
<P>Than dame Prudence, wythout delay or taryenge, sent anone her messanger for her kynsfolke and her olde frendes, whyche that were trewe and wise: and told hem by order, in the presence of Melibe, al the mater, as it is aboue expressed and declared. And prayed hem that they wolde saye theyr aduyse and counsayle what best were to do in this nede. And whan Melibeus frendes had taken her

aduyse and delyberacion of the forsayd ma∣ter, and had examyned it by great busynesse and dilygence. They yaue ful counsaile for to haue peace and rest, and that Melibee shulde receyue wyth good hert hys aduersaris, to foryeuenesse and mercy.</P>
<P>And whan dame Prudence had herd thas∣sent of her lorde Melibee, and the counsayle of hys frendes accorde with her wyl and her entencion, she was wondersly gladde in her hert, and sayde. There is an olde prouerbe (sayd she) That y<SUP>e</SUP> goodnesse that thou maist do this day, do it, and abyde it nat, ne delay it nat tyl the next daye. And therfore I coun∣sayle, that ye sende your messengers, suche as be discrete and wyse, vnto your aduersaries: tellyng hem on your behalf, that yf they wol treat of peace and accorde, that they shape hē wyth out delay or taryeng, to come vnto vs: whyche thyng performed was in dede. And whan these trespasours, and repentyng folke of her folies, that is to say, the aduersaries of Melibeus, had herde what these messangers sayd vnto hem, they were ryght gladde and ioyful, and answered ful mekely and benyg∣nely, yeldyng grace and thankes to her lorde Melibe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and to al hys companye: and shope hem without delaye to go wyth the messan∣gers, and obeyed to the commaundement of her lorde Melibeus. And ryght anone they toke her way to the courte of Melibe, &amp; toke with hem some of their true frēdes, to make faythe for hem, &amp; for to be her borowes: And whā they were comen to the presence of Me∣libee, he sayd to hem these wordes. It ston∣deth thus, sayde Melibee, and soth it is, that causelesse &amp; without skyl and reson, ye haue done great iniuries and wronges to me and my wyfe Prudence, and to my doughter also, for ye haue entred in to my house by violence and haue done suche outrage, that all men knowe wel that ye haue deserued dethe. And therfore woll I knowe and wete of you, whether ye woll put the punishynge and the chastylyng and the vengeaunce of thys out∣rage, in the wyl of me and of my wyfe, or ye wol not.</P>
<P>Than the wysest of hem thre answerd for hem al, and sayd. Sir (sayd he) we know wel that we ben vnworthy to come to the courte of so great a lorde and so worthy as ye be, for we haue so gretly mistaken vs, and haue of∣fended and agylted in such wyse agayn your hygh lordshyp, that truely we haile deserued the dethe, but yet for the great goodnesse and debonairte, that al the worlde wytnesseth of your person, we submytte vs to y<SUP>e</SUP> excellēcye and benygnytye of your gracious lordeshyp, and ben redy to obey to al your commaunde∣mentes, besechynge you, that of your mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia∣ble pyte ye wel consyder oure great repen∣taunce, and lowe submyssyon, and graunt vs foryeuenesse of our outragyous trespace and offence: For wel we knowe, that your liberal grace and mercye stretcheth ferther in to the goodnesse, than don oure outragious gyltes and trespaces in to the wyckednesse. Al be it that cursedly and damnably we haue agilted agaynst your hygh lordshyp.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Han Melibee tooke hem vp fro the grounde ful benygnely, and receyued her oblygacions and her bondes by her othes vpon her pledges and borowes, and assyned hem a certayne day to retourne vnto hys courte, for to receyue and accept the sen∣tence and iugement that Melibeus wolde cō¦maunde to be don on hem, by the causes afor∣sayd, which thynges ordayned, euery man re∣turned to hys house.</P>
<P>And whan dame Prudēce sawe her tyme, she fayned and asked her lorde Melibe, what vengeaunce he thought to take on hys ad∣uersaries.</P>
<P>To whyche Melibe answerde, and sayde▪ Certes (sayde he.) I thynke and purpose me fully to disherit thē of al that euer they haue, and for to putte them in exile for euer.</P>
<P>Certes sayd dame Prudence, thys were a cruel sentence, and moche ayenst reason. For ye be rich ynough, and haue no nede of other mennes riches. And ye might lyghtly in this wyse gete you a couetous name, whiche is a vicious thyng, and ought be eschewed of eue∣ry good man. For after the sayeng of the apo∣stel: Couetise is rote of al harmes. And ther∣fore it wer better to you to lese so moch good of your owne, than for to take of theyr good in thys maner. For better it is to lese good with worship, than to wyn good with vila∣nye and shame. And euerye man ought to do his dilygence and his busynesse, to gette him a good name. And yet shal he not onely busy
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="101"/>
him in kepyng hys good name, but he shal al so enforce hym alwaye to do some thynge, by whiche he may renewe hys good name. For it is writtē, that the old good lose of a mā or good name, is soone gone and past, whan it is not renewed. And as touchynge, that ye say that ye wol exile your aduersaries: that thynketh me moche ayenst reason, and out of measure, consydringe the power that they haue yeue you vpon them selfe. And it is wrytten: that he is worthy to lese hys pryui∣lege, that mysuseth y<SUP>e</SUP> might and power that is gyuen hym. And I sette case, ye might en∣ioyne hem y<SUP>t</SUP> payne by right &amp; lawe, whiche I trowe ye maye nat do: I saye, ye myghte not put it to execution, for parauenture than it were lyke to tourne to y<SUP>e</SUP> werre, as it was before. And therfore yf ye woll that men do you obeysaunce, ye muste demean you more curteisly, that is to saye: ye muste yeue more easy sentences and iugement. For it is wryt∣ten: he that most curteisly commaundeth, to hym men moost obey. And therfore I praye you, that in thys necessyte and in thys nede, ye caste you to ouercome youre hert. For as Senet sayth: he that ouercometh hys herte, ouercometh twise. And Tully sayth: there is nothyng so commendable in a great lorde, as whan he is debonaire and meke, and apeseth hym lyghtly. And I praye you that ye woll nowe forbere to do vengeaunce, in suche a maner, that youre good name maye be kepte and conserued, and that men may haue cause and mater to prayse you of pyte and mercye: and that ye haue no cause to repent you of thynge that is done. For Senecke saythe: he ouercometh in an yuel manere, that repen∣teth hym of hys victorie. Wherfore I praye you, let mercy be in your hert, to theffecte and entent, that god almyghty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> haue mercy vpō you in hys last iugement.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>Vr swete Lorde God of heuen, wolde that no mā shulde peryshe, but that we tourne al to the know lege of hym, &amp; to the blys∣full lyfe that is perdura∣ble, amonysheth vs by the prophete Ieremye, that sayeth in thys wyse. Standeth vpon the wayes and seeth, and as∣keth of olde pathes: that is to saye, of olde sentences, whych is the good waye, and wal¦keth in that waye, and ye shall fynde refresh∣ynge for your soules. &amp;c. Many be the wayes espirituels that lede folke to oure Lorde Ie∣su Christe, and to the reygne of glorye: Of whych wayes there is a full noble way, and full couenable, which maye not fayle to man ne to woman, that through synne hath mys∣gone fro the ryght waye of Hierusalem cele∣stiall: and thys waye is called penitence, of whych man shulde gladly herkē and enquire wyth al hys herte, to wete what is penitēce, and whych is called penitence, and how ma∣ny maners bene of actions or werkynges of penitence, and howe many speces there bene of penitence, and whych thinges appertayne and behoue to penitence, and which thynges dystourbe penitence.</P>
<P>Saynt Ambrose sayeth, that penitence is the playnynge of man for the gylte y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath done, &amp; no more to do any thynge for whych him ought to playne. And some doctoure say¦eth, Penitence is the waymentynge of man that soroweth for his synne, and paineth him selfe, for he hath mysdone Penitēce wyth cer¦tayne circumstaunces, is very repentaūce of a man that holt hym selfe in sorowe, &amp; other payne for hys gyltes: and for he shalbe very penytent, he shall fyrst bewayle synnes that he hath done, and stedfastlye purpose in hys herte to haue shryfte of mouth, and to do satis¦faccion, and neuer to do thynge, for whyche hym ought more bewayle or complayne, and continue in good workes: or els hys repen∣taunce maye not auayle. For as saint Isoder sayeth. He is a iaper and a lyer, &amp; no very re∣pentaunt, that eftsone doth thinge, for which hym ought repent. Wepynge and not for to stynte to do synne, may not auayle: But nat∣thelesse mē shal hope that at euery tyme that man falleth, be it neuer so ofte, that he maye aryse through penaūce, yf he haue grace: but certayne it is great doute, for as sayeth saynt Gregorye. Vnnethes aryseth he out of synne that is charged wyth y<SUP>e</SUP> charge of yuel vsage.
<PB N="ci" REF="113"/>
And therfore repentaunt folke, that stynt for to synne, and leue synne or synne leue them, holy churche holdeth them syker of theyr sal∣uacion. And he that synneth, and verely repē¦teth hym in hys laste ende: holy churche yet hopeth hys saluacion, by the great mercye of our Lorde Iesu Christ, for hys repentaunce: but take the syker waye.</P>
<P>¶And nowe syth I haue declared you, what thynge is Penitence, now ye shal vnderstād, that there ben thre actions of penitence. The fyrst is, that a man be baptysed after that he hath synned. Saynt Austyn sayeth, but he be penitent for hys olde synfull lyfe, he maye not begynne the newe clene lyfe: For certes yf he be baptysed wythout penitence of hys olde gylte, he retayneth y<SUP>e</SUP> marke of baptyme, but not the grace ne the remissyon of hys syn¦nes, tyll he haue very repentaunce. An other defaute is thys, that men do deedly synne af∣ter that they haue receyued baptysme. The thyrde defaute is thys, that men fall in veni∣all synnes after her baptysme, fro day to day. Therof sayeth saynt Augustyne, that peni∣tence of good and humble folke, is the peni∣tence of euery daye.</P>
<P>The speces of penitence ben thre: That one of hem is solempne: an other is cōmune, &amp; the thyrd is priuy. That penaūce that is so¦lempne is in two maners: As to be put out of holy churche in lent, for slaughter of chyl∣dren, and suche maner thynge. An other is when a man hath synned openly, of whyche synne the fame is openly spoken in the coun∣trey: and then holy church by iugement, dy∣strayneth hym for to do open penaunce.</P>
<P>Cōmen penaunce is, that preestes enioyne men in certayne case:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> as for to go perauēture naked in pylgrymage, or barefote. Priuy pe∣naunce is that, that men do al daye for priuy synnes, of whych we shryue vs priuely, and receyue priuy penaunce.</P>
<P>¶Nowe shalt thou vnderstande, what is be∣houefull and necessarye to very perfyte peny∣tence: and thys stonte on thre thynges. Con∣tricion of herte, confession of mouthe, and sa∣tisfaction. For whych sayth saynt Iohn Chri¦sostome. Penitence dystrayneth a man to ac∣cept benignely euery payne, that hym is en∣ioyned, wyth contricion of herte, and shryfte of mouthe, wyth satisfaction: and in wer∣dynge of all maner humilite. And thys is frutefull penitence ayenst thre thynges, in whyche we wrath our Lorde Iesu Christe: thys is to saye: By delyte in thynkynge, by retchlesnesse in speakinge, and by wycked syn full werkynge. And ayenst these wycked gyltes is penitence, that maye be lykened vn¦to a tree.</P>
<P>The roote of thys tree is contricion, that hydeth hym in the herte of hym that is verye repentaūt, ryght as the roote of a tree hydeth hym in the earth. Of thys roote of contricion spryngeth a stalke, that beareth braunches &amp; leues of confessyon, and frute of satisfaction. For whych Christ sayth in hys gospel. Doth digne fruyte of penitence, for by thys fruyte men maye knowe the tre, and not by the rote that is hyde in the herte of man, ne by y<SUP>e</SUP> braū¦ches, ne the leues of confession. And therfore our Lorde Iesu Christ sayeth thus: By the fruyte of hem shall ye knowe hem. Of thys roote also spryngeth a sede of grace, y<SUP>t</SUP> whych sede is mother of all sykernesse, and thys sede is egre &amp; hote. The grace of thys sede spryn¦geth of God, through remembraunce of the daye of dome, and on the paynes of hell. Of thys mater sayeth Salomon, that in y<SUP>e</SUP> drede of God, man forletteth hys synne. The heate of thys sede is the loue of God, and the desy∣rynge of the ioye perdurable: Thys hete dra¦weth the herte of man to God, and doth him hate hys synne: For sothly there is nothynge that sauoureth so well to a chyld, as y<SUP>e</SUP> mylke of hys nouryce, ne nothynge is to hym more abhominable then that malke, whē it is med¦led wyth other meate. Ryght so the synfull man that loueth hys synne, hym semeth that it is to hym moost swete of any thynge, but fro that tyme he loueth sadlye our Lorde Ie¦su Christe, and desyreth the lyfe perdurable, there is to hym nothinge more abhominable For sothly the lawe of god is the loue of god For whyche Dauid the prophete sayeth: I haue loued thy lawe, and hated wyckednesse. He that loueth God, kepeth hys lawe and hys worde.</P>
<P>¶Thys tree sawe the prophete Daniell in spirite, on the visyon of Nabuchodonosor, when he counsayled hym to do penitence. Penaunce is the tree of lyfe, to hem that it receyue, and he that holdeth hym in very pe∣nitence is blessed, after the sentence of Salo∣mon. In thys penitence or contricion, man

shal vnderstand foure thynges, that is to say what is contrityon, and whyche ben the cau∣ses that moue a man to contricion, and howe he shulde be contryte, and what contricion auayleth to the soule. Then is it thus that contricion is the very sorowe, that a mā receyueth in hys herte for hys synnes, wyth sadde purpose to shryue hym, and to do pe∣naunce, and neuer more to do synne: And thys sorowe shalbe in thys maner, as sayeth saynt Bernarde: It shalbe heuye and gre∣uous, and full sharpe and poynaunt in herte.</P>
<P>¶Fyrste, for a man hath agylted hys lorde and hys creatoure, and more sharpe and poy∣naunt, for he hath agylted hys father celesti¦all: And yet more sharpe and poynaunt, for he hath wrathed &amp; agylted him that bought hym, that wyth hys preciouse bloude hath de¦lyuered vs fro the bondes of synne, and fro the cruelte of the dyuell, and fro the paynes of hell.</P>
<P>The causes that ought moue a man to cō∣tricion bene syxe. Fyrste a man shall remem¦bre hym of hys synnes, but loke that that re∣membraunce ne be to hym no delyte, by no waye, but great shame &amp; sorowe for hys syn∣nes. For Iob sayeth, synfull men done wor∣kes worthy of confessyon. And therfore say∣eth Ezechiel: I wol remembre me al the ye∣res of my lyfe, in the bytternesse of my herte And God sayeth in the Apocalypse: Remē∣bre ye from whence that ye be fall, for before that tyme that ye synned, ye were chyldren of God, and lymmes of the raygne of God: But for youre synne ye be waren thrall and foule and membres of the fende: hate of aungels, slaunder of holye churche, and foode of the false serpent, perpetual matere of the fyre of hel: And yet more foule and abhominable, for ye trespace so oft tymes, as doth an hoūde that returneth ayen to eate hys owne spew∣ynge: and yet be ye fouler, for youre longe cō¦tinuynge in synne, and youre synfull vsage, for whyche ye be rooted in youre synne, as a beest in hys donge. Suche maner of though∣tes make a man to haue shame of hys synne, and no delyte. As God sayeth, by the prophet Ezechiel: ye shal remēbre you of your wayes and they shal dysplease you sothly. Synnes ben the wayes that lede folke to hell.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He seconde cause that oughte make a man to haue dysdayne of sinne is this, that as sayeth saynt Peter: who so doth syn, is thrall of synne, and synne putteth a man in great thral∣dome. And therfore sayeth the prophete Eze∣chiel: I wente sorowfull, in dysdayne of my selfe. Certes well ought a mā haue dysdayne of synne, and wythdrawe hym fro that thral∣dome and vylanye. And lo what sayeth Se∣neke in thys mater, he sayeth thus: Though I wyste, that neyther God ne man shulde ne¦uer knowe it, yet wolde I haue dysdayne for to synne. And the same Seneke also sayeth: I am borne to greater thynge, thē to be thral to my body, or for to make of my body a thral Ne a fouler thrall maye no man ne woman make of hys bodye, then for to yeue his body to do synne, al were it y<SUP>e</SUP> foulest churle, or the foulest woman that lyueth, and lest of value, yet is he then more foule and more in serui∣tude. Euer fro the hygher degre that man fal¦leth the more is he thrall, and more to God &amp; to the worlde vyle &amp; abhomynable. O good God, well ought man haue great dysdayne of synne, sythe that throughe synne, there he was free he is made bonde. And therfore say¦eth saynt Austyne: Yf thou hast dysdayne of thy seruaunt, yf he oftēde or synne, haue thou then dysdayne that thou thy selfe shuldest do synne. Take rewarde of thyne owne value, that thou ne be to foule to thy selfe. Alas wel ought they then haue dysdayne to be seruaū∣tes and thralles to synne, and sore to be asha∣med of them selfe, that God of hys endlesse goodnesse hathe sette in hygh astate, or yeue hem wytte, strength of bodye, heale, beauty, or prosperite and boughte hem fro the death wyth hys herte bloude, that they so vnkynd∣lye agaynst hys gentylnesse quyte hym so vy¦laynously to slaughter of her owne soules.

O good God, moch ought a man to drede suche a iugement, ther as we shalbe al, as saint Poule sayeth, before y<SUP>e</SUP> sete of our Lorde Iesu Christe, where as he shal make a generall congregation, where as no man may be absent, for certes there auayleth none essoyne ne excusation, and not only that oure defautes shalbe iuged, but also that all our w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rkes shal opēly be knowē. And as say¦eth saint Bernarde, there ne shal no pleading auayle, ne no sleyght: we shal yeue rekenyng of euery ydell worde. There shall we haue a iuge that maye not be dysceyued ne corrupte, and why? For certes, all our thoughtes bene dyscouered, as to hym, ne for prayer ne for mede, he shall not be corrupte. And therfore sayeth Salomō: The wrath of God ne wol not spare no wyght, for prayer ne for yeffe. And therfore at the daye of dome, there is no hope to escape. Wherfore as sayeth saint An¦selme: full greate anguyshe shall the synfull folke haue at that tyme: There shal y<SUP>e</SUP> fyerce and wroth iuge sytte aboue, and vnder hym the horrible pytte of hell open, to destroy him that muste be knowe hys synnes, whych syn∣nes openlye ben shewed before God &amp; before euery creature: And on the lefte syde, mo dy∣uels then any herte may thynke, for to hale &amp; drawe the synfull soules to the payne of hel, and wythin the hertes of folke shalbe the by∣tynge conscience, and wythout forth shall be the worlde al brennynge: whyther shal then the wretched synfull man flye to hyde hym? Certes he maye not hyde hym, he must come forth and shewe hym. For certes as sayeth saynt Ierome, the earth shall cast hym out of it and the see also, and the ayre that shalbe ful of thonder clappes and lyghtenynges. Now sothly, who so woll remembreth him of these thynges: I gesse, that thys synne shall not turne hym in delyte, but to greate sorowe, for dredde of the payne of hell. And therfore sayeth Iob to God: suffre lorde, that I may a whyle bewaile and wepe, er I go without returnynge to the derke londe, couered wyth the darkenesse of death, to the lāde of mysese and of derknesse, where as is the shadowe of death, where as there is none ordre, or ordy∣naunce, but ferefull drede that euer shall last. Lo, here maye ye se, that Iob prayed respyte a whyle, to bewepe and wayle hys trespace: for sothly one day of respyte is better then al the treasoure of thys worlde. And for as moche as a man maye acquyte hym selfe be∣fore God by penitence in thys worlde, and not by treasoure, therfore shulde he praye to God to yeue hym respyte a whyle, to bewepe and wayle hys trespace: For certes al the so∣rowe that a man myght make fro the begyn∣nynge of the worlde, nys but a lytell thynge, at regarde of the sorowe of hell. The cause why that Iob calleth hell the lande of dark∣nesse, vnderstandeth that he calleth it lande or earth, for it is stable and neuer shal fayle, and derke: for he that is in hell hath defaute of lyght material, for certes the darke lyght that shall come out of the fyre that euer shall brenne, shall turne hym all to payne that is in hell, for it sheweth hym to the horrible de¦uels that hym turmenteth, couered wyth the darkenesse of death, that is to saye, that he that is in hel, shal haue defaute of the syght of God: for certes the syght of God is y<SUP>e</SUP> lyfe perdurable. The derkenesse of death, bene the synnes that the wretched man hath done whyche that dystourbe hym to se the face of God, ryght as the derke cloude betwyxt vs and the sunne. Londe of mysese, bycause that there ben thre maner of defautes, ayenst thre thynges that folke of thys worlde haue in thys present lyfe, that is to saye: honours, de∣lyces, and richesse. Ayenst honoure haue they in hell, shame and confusyon: For well ye wote, that men call honoure the reuerence that man doth to man, but in hell is none ho¦noure ne reuerence. For certes, no more re∣uerence shalbe do there to a kynge, then to a knaue. For whyche God sayeth by the pro∣phete Ieremye: Those folke that me dyspise shalbe in dyspyte. Honour is also called great lordshyp: there shall no wyght serue other, but of harme &amp; turment. Honoure is also cal∣led great dygnite &amp; hyghnesse, but in hel shal they be al fortroden of dyuels. As god sayeth

the horrible deuels shall go and come vpon the heedes of dampned folke: and thys is for as moche as y<SUP>e</SUP> hygher that they were in this present lyfe, the more shal they be abated and defoyled in hell. Ayenst the rychesse of thys worlde shal they haue mysese of pouerte, that shal be in foure thynges: In defaute of trea∣soure. Of whyche Dauid sayeth: The ryche folke that enbrase and knytte all her herte to treasoure of thys worlde, shall slepe in the slepynge of death, and nothynge ne shul they fynde in her hondes of all her treasoure. And more ouer the mysese of hel shalbe in defaute of meate and drynke. For God sayeth thus by Moses: They shalbe wasted wyth hon∣ger, and the byrdes of hell shal deuoure hem, wyth bytter death, and the gall of the dragon shall be her drynke, and the venym of the dra¦gon her morsels. Also her mysease shalbe in defaute of clothynge, for they shalbe naked in bodye, as of clothynge, saue the fyre in whych they brenne, and other fylthes: &amp; naked shall they be of soule, of all maner of vertues, whyche that is the clothynge of the soule. Where bene then the gaye robes, the softe shetes, and the smale shertes? Lo, what say∣eth God of hem by the prophete Isaye, that vnder hem shall be strewed moughtes, and her couertures shall be of wormes of hell? Also her mysease shalbe in defaut of frendes for he is not poore that hath good frendes, but there is no frende, for neyther God ne no creature shalbe frende to them, &amp; eche of hem shall hate other wyth deedly hate: The son∣nes and the doughters shall rebell ayenst fa∣ther and mother, and kynrede ayenst kynred, chyde &amp; dispyse eche other, both daye &amp; nyght as god sayeth by the prophete Micheas: And the louynge chyldrē y<SUP>t</SUP> whylom loued so flesh∣lye eche other, wolde eche of hem eate other yf they myght. For howe shulde they loue to¦gyther in the paynes of hell, whē they hated eche other ī y<SUP>e</SUP> prosperite of this life: for trust wel, her fleshly loue was deadly hate. As say¦eth the prophet Dauid: who so y<SUP>u</SUP> loueth wyc¦kednesse, he hateth his soule, &amp; who so hateth hys owne soule, certes he may loue none o∣ther wyght in no maner: And therfore in hel is no solace ne no frendshyp, but euer y<SUP>t</SUP> more kynredes that ben in hel, the more cursynges the more chydynges, and y<SUP>e</SUP> more deedly hate there is amonge them. Also they shal haue de¦faute of all maner delyces, for certes helyces ben after the appetites of the fyue wittes: as syght, hearynge, smellynge, sauourynge, and touchynge. But in hell her syght shalbe ful of derknesse and of smoke, &amp; therfore full of tea∣res, and her hearynge full of waylynge and gryntynge of tethe: As sayeth Iesu Christe. Her nostrylles shalbe ful of stynkynge. And as sayeth Isaye the prophete: Her sauou∣rynge shalbe full of bytter gall, and as tou∣chynge of al her bodyes, ycouered wyth fyre that neuer shall quenche, and wyth wormes that neuer shall dye. As God sayeth by the mouthe of Isaye: and for as moche as they shall not wene that they maye dye for payne, and by death flye fro payne, that maye they vnderstande in the wordes of Iob, that say∣eth: There is the shadowe of deathe. Certes a shadowe hath the lykenes of the thynge of whych it is shadowed, but shadowe is not y<SUP>e</SUP> same thynge of whych it is shadowed: ryght so fareth the payne of hel, it is lyke death, for the horrible anguyshe. And why? For it pay∣neth hem euer as though they shulde dye a∣none, but certes they shal not dye. For as say∣eth saynt Gregory to wretched caytyses shall be death wythout death, &amp; ende wythout end &amp; defaute wythout fayling, for her death shal alway lyue, &amp; her ende shall euer more begyn and her defaute shal not fayle.</P>
<P>And therfore sayeth saynt Iohn the Euan¦gelyst, they shal folowe death and they shall not fynde hym, and they shall desyre to dye, &amp; death shall slye fro hem. And also Iob say∣eth, that in hel is no ordre of rule. And al be it so, that God hath create al thynge in ryghte order, and nothynge wythout order, but all thynges ben ordred and nombred, yet nathe∣lesse they that ben dampned ben nothynge in order, ne hold none order, for the erth ne shal beare hem no frute. For as the prophete Da∣uid sayeth: God shall destroye the frute of the earth, as for hem, ne water, ne shal yeue hem no moysture, ne the eyre no refreshynge, ne fyre no lyght.

And therfore sayeth Salomon: The wycked man dyeth, &amp; whā he is deed, he shal haue no hope to escape fro payne▪ who so than wolde wel vnderstonde the paynes, and bethynke hym well that he hath deserued those paynes for his synnes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es he shuld haue more talēt to sygh and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye, than for to synge and playe.

And vpon that chapter sayth S.

And ye shal vnderstond, that in mans synne is euerye maner ordre or ordy∣naunce turned vp so downe. For it is soth, that god, reason, sensualitie, and the body of man, bene ordayned that eche of these foure thynges shoulde haue lordshyppe ouer that other: as thus, God should haue lordshyppe ouer reason, and reason ouer sensualytye, and sensualitie ouer the body of man.

This suffred oure Lord Iesu Christ for man, after that he had be betrayed of his disciple, &amp; distrayned and bound, so that his bloude brast out at euery nayle of his hondes, as sayth s. Austin. And ferthermore, for as moche as reason of man wol not daunt sensualite, when it may, ther¦fore is man worthye to haue shame: &amp; thys suffred our Lord Iesu christ for man, whan they spyt in his visage. And ferthermore for as moch thā as the caytif body of man is re¦bel both to resō &amp; to sensualitie, therfore it is worthy death: &amp; this suffred our Lord Iesu Chryst vpon the crosse, where as there was no parte of his bodye free withoute greate payne &amp; bytter passyon: and all this suffred our Lord Iesu Chryst that neuer forfayted And therfore resonably maye be sayd of Ie∣su in this maner: To moch am I pained for thinges that I neuer deserued, and to moch defouled for shame that man is worthye to haue: And therfore may the synful man wel say, as saynt Bernarde. Accursed be the byt∣ternesse of my synne, for which ther must be suffred so moche bitternesse. For certes after the dyuers discordaunce of our wickednesse was the passyon of Iesu Chryste ordayned in dyuers thynges: as thus. Certes synfull mans soule is betrayed of the deuyll by coue¦tyse of temporal prosperitie, &amp; scorned by dis¦ceyte when that he cheseth fleshly desyres, &amp; yet it is turmented by impatience of aduer∣sitie, &amp; bespet by seruage &amp; subiection of syn, and at the last it is slayne fynallye. For this disordinaūce of synful man was Iesu christ betrayed, &amp; after y<SUP>t</SUP> was he boūde, that came for to vnbynde vs of synne &amp; of payne.

Than was accōplis¦shed the wordes of Esay: He was woūded for our mysdedes, and defoyled for our felo¦nies. Now sith that Iesu christ toke on him the paines of our wickednesses, moch ought synful man wepe and bewayle, that for hys synnes Gods sonne of heuen, should al this payne endure.</P>

largenesse &amp; of his souerayn boūty, therfore is he called (Iesus Nazarenus rex Indeo∣rū) Iesus is to saye, sauyour or saluaciō, on whom men shall hope to haue foryeuenesse of synnes, which that is proprely saluacion of synnes. And therfore said the angel to Io¦seph: thou shalte call his name Iesus, that shall saue his people of her synnes. And her of sayth s. Peter: There is none other name vnder heuen y<SUP>t</SUP> is yeue to any man, by which a man maye be saued, but only Iesus. Naza¦renus is as moche for to saye, as floryshing in which a mā shal hope, that he that yeueth hym remyssyon of synnes, shall yeue hym al so grace well for to do. I was at the dore of thyne hert, sayth Iesus, &amp; called for to enter he that openeth to me shal haue foryeuenes of synne. I wyl entre to hym by my grace, &amp; suppe with hym by the good werkes, that he shall do, whiche werkes ben the foode of the soul, &amp; he shal suppe with me by y<SUP>e</SUP> great ioye that I shal yeue hym. Thus shall man hope for his werkes of penaunce, that God shall yeue hym hys reygne, as he behyghte hym in the gospell. Now shal a man vnder∣stonde in whiche maner shall be his contry¦tion: I saye that it shalbe vniuersall and to∣tall, this is to saye: a man shalbe very repen¦taunt for all his synnes that he hath done in delyte of his thought, for it is ryght peryl∣lous. For there ben two maner of consentin¦ges, that one of hem is called consentyng of affection, whan a man is moued to do syn, and than delyteth hym longe for to thynke on that synne, and his reason apperceyueth it well that it is synne ayenst the law of god and yet his reason refrayneth not his foule delyte or talent, though he se well apertlye, that it is ayenste the reuerence of God, al∣though his reason ne consent not to do that synne in dede, yet saye some doctoures that suche delyte that dwelleth longe is ful peril¦lous, albeit neuer so lytle. And also a man shoulde sorowe, namely for all that euer he hath desyred ayenst the lawe of God, wyth perfyt consentyng of his reason, for thereof is no doubt that it is deedly synne in consen¦tyng: for certes there is no deedly synne, but that it is fyrste in mans thought, and after that in his delyte, and so forth into consen∣tynge and into dede: wherfore I saye that many mē ne repēt hem neuer of such though¦tes and delytes, ne neuer shryue hym of it, but onelye of the dede of greate synnes out∣warde: wherfore I saye that suche wycked delytes bene subtyll begylers of them that shalbe dampned. Moreouer, man ought to sorowe for his wycked wordes as well as for hys wycked dedes: for certes the repen∣taūce of a synguler syn, and not repentaunt of all his other synnes, or els repent hym of all his other synnes, and not of a syngular syn, may not auayle: For certes god almigh¦tye is all good, and therfore eyther he forye∣ueth all, or els ryght nought. And therfore sayth saynct Austyn: I wot certaynly that god is enemye to euery synner: and how thā he that obserueth one synne, shal he haue for yeuenesse of those other synnes? Naye. And moreouer cōtrition shuld be wonder sorow∣full and anguishous, &amp; therfore yeueth hym God playnly hys mercy: And therfore whā my soule was anguyshed and sorowfull w<SUP>t</SUP>∣in me, than had I remembraunce of God, that my prayer myght come to hym. Fer∣thermore, contrition must be contynuall, &amp; that man haue stedfaste purpose to shryue hym, and to amende hym of his lyfe. For sothly whyle contrition lasteth, man maye euer hope to haue foryeuenesse. And of thys cōmeth hate of synne, that destroyeth bothe synne in hym selfe, and also in other folke at hys power. For which sayeth Dauid: They that loue god hate wyckednesse: For to loue god is for to loue that he loueth, and hate y<SUP>t</SUP> he hateth. The last thynge that men shal vn¦derstande is this. wherfore auayleth contri∣tion. I saye the contrition somtyme delyue∣reth man fro synne: Of which Dauid sayth I saye, sayd Dauid: I purposed fermely to shryue me, and thou Lorde releaseddest my synne. And ryght so as contrition auayleth not without sad purpose of shrift if mā haue oportunitye, ryght so lytle worth is shryfte or satisfaction withoute contrition. And moreouer contrition destroyeth the prisō of hell, &amp; maketh weake and feble all the stren∣gthes of the deuylles, and restoreth the yef∣tes of the holy ghost and of al good vertues and it clenseth the soule of syn, &amp; delyuereth it fro the payne of hell, &amp; fro the company of the dyuel, and fro the seruage of synne, and restoreth it to all goodes spirituels, to the companye and communion of holy churche.

Ferthermore it maketh hym that whylom was sonne of yre, to be the sonne of grace. And all these thynges ben proued by holye wrytte.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He seconde parte of penitence is confessyon, that is signe of con∣trition. Now shul ye vnderstōd what is confessyon, and yf it ought to be done or no, &amp; which thynges be couenable to very confessyon. Fyrst shalt thou vnderstond y<SUP>e</SUP> confessyon is very shewyng of synnes to the prest: this is to saye very, for he must confesse hym of all the condicions that belonge to his synne, as ferforth as he can: al must be said, &amp; nothing excused ne hydde, and not auaunt the of thy good werkes. Also it is necessary to vnder∣stonde whence that synnes spring, &amp; howe they entre, and which they ben. Of the sprin¦gyng of synnes sayeth saynt Poule in thys wyse: that ryght as by one man, syn entred fyrst into this worlde, and through syn deth ryght so the deth entreth into all men that synne, and this man was Adam, by whom synne entred into this world, whē he brake the commaundement of God. And therfore he that fyrst was so mighty that he ne shuld haue dyed, becam so that he must nedes dye whether he wolde or no, and all his proge∣ny in this worlde that in the sayd man syn∣ned. Loke that in the state of innocency whē Adam and Eue were naked in paradyse, &amp; shamed not therof, how the serpent wylyest of all other beastes that god made, sayde to the woman: why commaunded god you y<SUP>t</SUP> ye shulde not eate of euery tree in paradyse? The woman answered: Of the frute sayde she of the trees of paradyse we fede vs, but of the frute of the mydle tre of paradyse god forbod vs to eat &amp; touche, lest we shuld dye. The serpent sayd to the woman. Nay nay, ye shall not dye of death, forsoth god wotte that what daye that ye eat therof, your eyē shall open, and ye shalbe as goddes, know∣ing good and harme. The woman thā saw that the tree was good to fedyng, and fayr to the eyen, and delectable to syght, she toke of the frute of the tree and ate, &amp; yaue to her husbonde, and he ate, and anon the eyen of hem both opened: And whā that they knew that they wer naked, they sowed of fyggele∣ues in maner of breches to hyde her mēbres There maye ye se that deedly syn hath fyrst suggestion of the fende as sheweth here by the adder, and afterwarde the delyte of the flesh, as sheweth by Eue, and after that con¦sentyng of reason, as sheweth here by Adā. For trust wel though so it were that y<SUP>e</SUP> fend tempted Eue, that is to say the flesh, and the fleshe had delyte in the beautye of the frute defended, yet certes tyll that reason, that is to say Adam, consented to the eatyng of the frute, yet stode he in the state of innocencie. Of the sayd Adam toke we the sayde origi∣nal syn of hym fleshly discended be we all, &amp; engendred of vyle and corrupte mater: And whan the soule is put in oure bodyes, right anon is contract original syn, and that that was erst but onely payne of concupiscencie is afterward both payne and syn, and ther∣fore we bene all borne sonnes of wrath, and of dampnatiō perdurable, if it nere baptym that we receyue, whiche benymmeth vs the coulpe but forsoth the pyne dwelleth wyth vs as to temptation, which pyne hyght con¦cupyscence. This concupiscence whan it is wrongfully disposed or ordayned in man, it maketh hym coueyte by couetysye of flesshe fleshly synne by syght of his eyen, as to erth¦lye thynges, and also couetyse of hyghnesse by pryde of herte.</P>
<P>Now as to speake of the first couetise that is concupiscence, after the lawe of our mem¦bres that were lawfully made, and by right¦ful iudgement of God: I saye for as moche as man is not obeysaunte to God, that is his Lorde, therfore is the flesh to hym diso∣beysaunt through concupiscence, whiche is called noryshing of synne, and occasyon of synne. Therfore all the whyle that a man hath within him the pyne of concupyscence it is impossyble but he be tēpted somtyme &amp; moued in his fleshe to syn. And this thynge

may not fayle as long as he lyueth. It may wel waxe feble by vertue of baptim, and by the grace of god through penitence, but ful∣ly ne shall it neuer quenche that he ne shall somtyme be moued in him self, but if he wer al refrayned by sycknesse or by malyce of sor¦cery or colde drynkes. For lo, what sayth s. Poule: the flesh coueteth ayenst the spyryte and the spyrite ayenst the flesh: they bene so contrary &amp; so stryuen, that a man maye not alway do as he wold. The same saynt poul after his greate penaunce, in water, and in londe: in water by night &amp; by day, in greate peryl and in great pyne. In londe, famyne &amp; thurst, colde, and clothlesse, &amp; ones sloned al¦most to deth. Yet (sayde he) alas, I caytyfe man, who shall delyuer me fro the prison of my caytyfe body? And saynt Ierom whē he longe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yme had dwelled in desert, where as he had no companye but of wylde beastes, where as he had no meate but herbes &amp; wa¦ter to drink, ne bed but the naked erth, wher¦fore his flesshe was blacke as an Ethiopien for hete and nye distroyed for colde. Yet sayd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that the brennyng of lechery boyled in al his body: wherfore I wot well that they be disceyued that saye, they be not tempted in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> bodyes. wytnesse saynt Iames y<SUP>t</SUP> sayeth that euerye wyght is tempted in hys owne consciēce, that is to say: that eche of vs hath mater and occasion to be tempted of the no¦rishing of syn that is in his body. And ther¦fore sayth saynt Iohn the euangelist: yf we say that we ben without synne, we disceyue our self, and truthe is not in vs. Now shall ye vnderstonde how syn wexeth and encrea∣eth in man. The first thing is the same no∣ryshing of syn of which I spoke before, the fleshlye cōcupiscence, and after that cōmeth suggestyon of the deuil, this is to say the de¦uyls belous, with which he bloweth in mā the fire of cōcupiscence, and after that a mā bethinketh him wheder he wyll do or no, y<SUP>e</SUP> thing to which he is tēpted. And then yf a man withstōd &amp; weyue the first entisyng of his fleshe, &amp; of the fende, thā it is no syn, &amp; yf so be he do not thā feleth he anon a flame of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te, &amp; thā it is good to beware &amp; kepe him well, or els he wyll fall anon, to cōsentynge of syn, &amp; than wyll he do it yf he maye haue tyme &amp; place. And of this mater sayth Mo∣ses by the deuyll, in this maner: y<SUP>e</SUP> fēd sayth, I wyll chace &amp; pursue man by wycked sug∣gestyon, &amp; I wyll take hym by mouyng and steryng of syn, &amp; I woll depart my pryse of my praye by delyberation, and my lust shal be accōplyshed in delyte: I wyll drawe my sworde in consentynge. For certes, ryght as a swerde departeth a thynge in two peces, ryght so cōsentyng departeth god fro man, &amp; than wyl I sle hym with my hond in dede of syn: thus sayth the fende. For certes than is a man all deed in soule, &amp; thus is syn accō¦plyshed with temptation by delyte &amp; consen¦tyng: &amp; than is the syn actual. Forsoth syn is in two maners, eyther it is venyall or deed∣ly syn. Sothlye whan man loueth any crea∣ture more then Iesu Chryste our creatour, than it is deedly synne, &amp; venyall synn it is, yf man loue Iesu chryst lesse thā him ought. Forsoth the dede of this venyal syn is ful pe¦rylous, for it mynissheth the loue that man shuld haue to god more and more. And ther¦fore yf a man charge hym selfe with manye suche venyall synnes: certes but if so be that he somtyme discharge hym of hem by shryft They may ful lyghtly mynysh in hym al the loue that he hath to Iesu Christ, and in this wyse skyppeth venyall synne into deedly sin For certes, the more that a man chargeth his soule with venyall synnes, the more he is enclyned to fall into deedlye synne. And therfore lette vs not be neglygent to charge vs of venyal synnes. For the prouerbe sayth that many small make a great. Herken this ensample. A greate vawe of the see com∣meth sometyme with so greate a vyolence, that it drowneth the shyppe. And the same harme do somtyme the smal droppes of wa¦ter that entreth through a lytle creueys, in∣to the tymbre and to the botume of the shyp, yf men be so geglygent, that they dyscharge hem not bytymes. And therfore althoughe there be a dyfference betwyxt these two cau¦ses of drownynge, allgates the shyppe is drowned. Ryghte so fareth it sometyme of deedlye synne, and of anoyous venyall syn∣nes, whan they multyplye in man so great∣lye, that those worldlye thynges that he lo∣ueth, through whyche he synneth venyally, is as great in his herte as the loue of God, or more: and therfore the loue of euery thing that is not beset in God, ne done pryncipal∣lye for Goddes sake, althoughe that a man
<PB REF="118"/>
loue it selfe then God: yet is it venyal synne and deedly synne whē the loue of any thing weyeth in the hert of man as moche as the loue of God or more. Deedly synne as sayth saynct Austyn is when a man turneth hys hert fro God: which that is very souerayne bounty that maye not chaunge: and gyueth his hert to a thyng that may chaunge &amp; flit and certes that is euery thyng saue God of heauen. For sothe is that if a manne gyue hys loue whyche that he oweth to God, with all his hert vnto a creature: certes as moche of loue as he yeueth to that same cre¦ature so moche he bereueth fro God: &amp; ther∣fore doth he synne. For he that is dettour to God ne yeldeth not to god al his det that is to saye: al the loue of his hert. Now sith mā vnderstandeth generally whiche is venyall syn, then it is couenable to tell specyallye of synne which that many a mā peraduenture demeth hem no synnes: &amp; shryueth hym not of the same thinges: &amp; yet neuerthelesse they be synnes sothly as these clerkes write that is to saye. At euery tyme that man eateth or drinketh more then suffiseth to y<SUP>e</SUP> sustenaūce of his body in certayne he doth synne: &amp; also when he speaketh more then it nedeth it is sinne. Also when he herkeneth not benignly the cōplaynt of the pore. Also when he is in heale of body: and wol not fast when other folkes faste withoute cause resonable: also when he slepeth more then nedeth: or when he cometh perchaūce to late to church: or o∣ther werkes of charitie. Also when he vseth his wyfe without souerayne desyre of engē¦drure to the honour of god: or for the entent to yelde to his wyfe dette of his body. Also when he wol not vysit the sycke or the priso¦ner: yf he maye. Also yf he loue wyfe or child or other wordly thyng more then reason re∣quyreth. Also yf he flatter or blandyse more then him ought for any necessitye. Also yf he minish or withdrawe y<SUP>e</SUP> almesse of the pore. Also if he apparel his meat more deliciously then nede is or eate to hastelye by lycorous∣nes. Also yf he talke vanityes at churche or at gods seruise, or that he be a talker of ydle wordes, of foly or vylanye, for he shal yelde accomptes of it at the daye of dome. Also when he behyghteth or assureth to do thyn∣ges that he may not performe. Also when y<SUP>t</SUP> he by lyghtnesse or folye myssayeth or scor∣neth his neighbour. Also when he hath any wicked susspection of any thynge that he ne wot of sothfastnesse. These thinges and mo without nōbre be synnes as sayth s. Austyn Now shal men vnderstande that albeit so y<SUP>t</SUP> none erthly man maye eschue al venyal syn∣nes, yet maye he refrayne hym by the bren∣nyng loue y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath to our lord Iesu chryst and by prayers and confession &amp; other good werkes, so that it shalbe but lytle grefe. For as saeth s. Austin: Yf a man loue god insuch maner, that al that euer he doth is the loue of god, or for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of god verely, for he brē¦neth in the loue of god: loke how moch that one droppe of water whiche doth fal into a great furneys ful of fyre anoyeth or greueth the brennyng of the fyre: in lyke maner ano∣yeth or greueth a venyall syn vnto that mā which is stedfast and perfyte in the loue of our sauyour Iesu Chryst. Ferthermore mē maye also refrayne and put awaye venyall syn, by commenyng and receyuing worthe∣ly the body of our sauyour Iesu Chryst.

Irreue∣rence is, whan manne dothe not honoure there as hym ought to do, and loke to be re∣uerenced. Pertinacye is whan men defende her foly, &amp; trust to much on her owne witte. Vaynglory is for to haue pompe and delite in hys temporel hynesse, and glorye hym in worldlye estates. Ianglynge is whan men speke to much before folke and clappeth as a myl, and take no kepe what they say. And yet is there a priuy spice of pride, that way∣teth fyrst to be salewed or he woll salue, all be he lesse worthy thā that other is. And al∣so he wayteth or desyreth to sytte, or els to go aboue hym in the waye, or kysse paxe, to be encensed, or go to offrynge before hys neyghbour, and such semblable thynges a∣yenst his dutie parauēture, but that he hath hys hert and hys entente, in suche a proude desyre to be magnyfyed and honoured be∣fore the people. Nowe bene here two ma∣ners of prides. One of hem is wythin the hert of a man, and that other is wythout. Of whych forsayd thynges sothlye and mo than I haue sayd apertayn to pride, that is in the hert of man, and other spices of pride ben wythout, but nathles, that one of these spices of pride is signe of that other, ryghte as the gay leuesel at the tauerne, is signe of the wyne that is in the celer. And thys is in many thynges: as in speche &amp; coūtenance &amp; outragious aray of clothyng: For certes, yf ther had ben no syn in clothing, Christ wold not so sone haue noted and spoken of the clo¦thyng of the ryche men in the gospell. And as saint Greg. saith that precious clothing is culpable, for the derth of it &amp; for his soft∣nesse, and for hys straungenesse and disgui∣syng: and for the superfluite, or for the inor∣dinate scantnesse of it. Alas? may nat a man se in our dayes the synfull costlye arraye of clothyng, and namely in to much superflui∣te, or elles in to disordinate scantnesse. As to the fyrst synne in superfluite of clothynge suche that maketh it so dere to the harme of the people, not only the cost of imbroydring the disguysed endendyng, or barringe, oun∣dyng, palyng, wyndynge, or bendynge, and semblable wast of cloth in vanite. But there is also the costlye furrynge in her gownes, so much pousyng of chesel to make hooles, so much daggyng of sheres forche, with the superfluite in lengthe of the foresayd gow∣nes, traylyng in the donge &amp; in the myre, on horse and also on fote, as well of man as of woman. That all that traylynge is verilye as in effecte wasted, consumed thredebare &amp; rotten wyth donge, rather than it is yeue to the poore, to greate damage of the forsayde pore folke, &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> in sōdrie wise, thys is to saye that the more the cloth is wasted, the more muste it coste the poore people for the scars∣nesse. And moreouer, yf so be that they wold yeue such pounsed and dagged clothyng to the poore people, it is not cōuenient to were for her estate, ne sufficient to her necessite, to kepe hem fro the distemperaunce of the fir∣mament.

And yf so be that they de∣part her hosen in other colours, as is white &amp; blew, or whyte and blacke, or blacke &amp; red and so forth: Thā semeth it as by variaūce of colour that y<SUP>u</SUP> halfe part of her preuy mē∣bres, ben corrupt by the fyre of saynt Antho¦ny, or by canker, or other such mischaunce. Of the hinder part of her buttockes it is ful horrible for to se, for certes in that parte of her body there as they purge her stynkynge ordure, that foule partie shew they to y<SUP>e</SUP> peo∣ple proudly in dispite of honestie, which ho∣nestie that Iesu Christ and hys frendes ob∣serued to shewe in her life. Now as the out∣ragious araye of women, God wotte that thoughe y<SUP>t</SUP> visages of some of hem seme full chast, &amp; debonayre, yet notify in her araye or afyre, licorousnes &amp; pride: I say not that ho¦nestie in clothing of mā or woman is vnco∣uenable, but certes the superfluitie of disor∣dinate quantite of clothynge is reprouable. Also the syn of ornement or of apparayle is in thinges that apertayne to rydynge, as in companye, delicate horses that bene holden for delite, that ben so fayre, fatte, &amp; costlye, &amp; also in many a nyce knaue, that is susteined bicause of hem, in curious harneis, as in sa∣dels, cropers, peytrels, &amp; bridels couered w<SUP>t</SUP> precious clothing, &amp; rich barres of plates of gold &amp; of siluer. For which god sayth by za∣charye the prophete, I woll confounde the ryders of such horses. These folke take lytel regarde of the riding of goddes sonne of he∣uen, and of hys harneys whan he rode vpō the asse, and non other harneys but the pore clothes of his disciples, ne we rede not that euer he rode on other beest. I speke thys for the synne of superfluitie, and not for resona∣ble honestye, whan reason it requireth. And moreouer, certes pryde is greatly notyfyed in holdynge of great meyny, whan they be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of lytle profyte, or of ryght no profyte, and namely whan that meyne is felonous and dammageous to the people by hardynes of hygh lordshyp, or by waye of offyces. For certes such lordes sell thā her lordshyppe to the dyuel of hell, whā they sustayne the wic¦kednesse of her meyne. Or els, whan these folke of lowe degree: as those that kepe ho∣stelries, sustayne these of the hostelers, and that is in manye maner of disceytes: those maner of folke ben the flyes that folow the hony, or els the houndes that folow the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣rayn. Such forsaid folke strangel spirituel∣ly her lordshyps: For such, thus sayeth Da∣uid the prophete, wicked death might come on those lordships, and God gyue that they might discend in to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l▪ all down: For in her houses bene iniquities and shreudnesse, and not god of heuen.

Pride of the ta∣ble appeareth also full ofte: for certes, ryche men ben called to festes and pore folke ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put awaye &amp; rebuked.

<PB N="cvii" REF="119"/>
of the goodes of grace. Certes the goodes of nature stondeth only in goodes of bodye, or goodes of y<SUP>e</SUP> soule. Certes goodes of the body bene heel of body, strength, deliuernes beautie, gentry, frāchise. Goodes of nature of the soule, ben good with sharpe vnderstā¦dyng, subtel engin, vertue naturel, good me¦mory. Goodes of fortune, be ryches, hye de∣grees of lordships, praysyngs of the people Goodes of grace: bene science, power to suf∣fer spounell traueyle, benigne, vertuous cō∣templation, vnderstanding of temptation &amp; semblable thynges: of whych forsayd goo∣des: certes it is a full greate folye, a man to haue pride in any of hem all. Nowe, as for to speke of goodes of nature, God wot, that somtyme we haue hem in nature, asmoche to our damage as to our profyt. As to speke of heel of body, truly it passeth ful lyghtly, &amp; also it is full oft occasion of sickenesse of the soule: for God wot y<SUP>e</SUP> fleshe is a great enemy to the shule: &amp; therfore the more that the bo∣dyes hole, the more be we in peril to fal. Al∣so for to haue pride in hys strength of body, it is an hie foly: for certes the fleshe coueteth ayenst the spirite: &amp; the more strōg the fleshe is the sorier maye the soule be. And ouer all this strength of body &amp; worldly hardinesse, causeth ful oft many man to perell and mis∣chaunce, &amp; also to haue pride of his gentry, is right great foly: for oftyme the gētry of y<SUP>e</SUP> body taketh awey the gentry of the soule: &amp; also we ben al of o father &amp; mother: &amp; all we ben of o nature rotten &amp; corrupt, both rich &amp; pore. Forsoth o maner gētry is for to praise that aparelleth mānes courage: wyt vertue &amp; moralite, maketh him Christes chyld. For trust well, that ouer what mā that syn hath maystry, he is a very churle to synne. Nowe ben there general signes of gētlenes as esche wyng of vice &amp; ribaudry, &amp; seruage of sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n worde, in werke, &amp; countenaunce &amp; vsyng of vertue, curtesy, &amp; clennes, &amp; to be li∣beral: that is to say, large by measure: for y<SUP>t</SUP> y<SUP>t</SUP> passeth measure, is foly &amp; synne: Another is to remembre hym of boūtie, that he of o∣ther folke hath receiued: Another is to be be¦nigne to hys good subictes, wherfore sayth Senecke: there is nothyng more couenable to a mā of hygh estate, than debonairte and pite. And therfore these flyes that men call bees, whan they make her kynge, they chese one that hath no pricke, wherwyth he may stynge.</P>
<P>Another is, man to haue a noble hert &amp; a diligent, to attayne to the hyghe vertuous thynges. Nowe certes, a man to haue pride in the goodes of grace, is also an outragi∣ous foly: for those gyftes of grace y<SUP>t</SUP> shulde haue tourned hym to goodnesse, and to me∣dycen, tourneth hym to venym and confusi∣on, as fayth saynte Greg. Certes also, who so hath pride in the goodnesse of fortune, he is a ful greate fole: For somtyme is a mā a great lorde by the morne, that is a catyfe, and a wretche or it be nyght: and somtyme the ryches of a man is cause of his death. Somtyme the delyces of a man, is cause of a greuous melady throughe whyche he dy∣eth. Certes, the comendation of the people is somtyme full false and brotell for to trust Thys day they prayse, to morow they bla∣me. God wot, desyre to haue cōmendation of the people, hath caused death to manye a busye man. Nowe syth that so it is, that ye haue vnderstande what is pride, and which be the speces of it, and whence it sourdeth &amp; spryngeth: nowe ye shall vnderstand which is the remedy ayenst it. Humilytie or meke∣nesse is the remedye ayenst pride, y<SUP>t</SUP> is a ver∣tue, through whyche a mā hath very know∣ledge of hym selfe, and holdeth of hym selfe no price ne deyntie, as in regarde of hys de¦sertes, consyderynge euer hys freelte. Now bene there thre maner of humilytes: As hu∣mylyte in herte, another humylytye is in mouthe, and the thyrde is in workes. The humilytie in herte, is in four maners: That one is, whan a manne holdeth hym selfe as nought worth before God of heuen. The seconde is, whan he dispiceth none other man. The thyrde is, whan he ne recketh nat though men holde hym nought worth. And the fourth is, whā he is not sory of his hu∣miliation. Also the humilitie of mouth is in four thinges. In a temperate speche, in hu∣militie of spech, &amp; whā he cōfesseth with his owne mouth, that he is suche as him thyn∣keth, that he is in his hert: Another is, whā he prayseth the bounte of another man &amp; no¦thyng therof minyssheth. Humilitye also in werke, is in foure maners. The fyrste is, whan he putteth other men before him, y<SUP>e</SUP> se¦cond is to chese the lowest place ouer al, the
<PB REF="120"/>
thyrde is, gladly to assent to good coūsayle, the fourth in, to stand gladly to the awarde of his souerains, or of him that is in hier de¦gre. Certeyn this is gret werke of humilite.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter Pride woll I speke of the foule synne of Enuye, whyche that is after the worde of the philosofer, sorow of other men¦nes prosperitie. And after the worde of saynt Augustin: it is sorowe of o∣ther mennes wele, &amp; the ioy of other mēnes harme. This foule synne is platly agaynste the holy ghost: al be it so, that euery synne is ayenst the holy gost: yet nathles, for asmoch as bounte apertayneth properly to the holy gost: &amp; enuy cometh properly of malice, ther¦fore it is properlye ayenst the bountie of the holy gost. Nowe hath malice two speces, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to say: hardines of herte in wickednes, or els the fleshe of a man is so blynde, that he cōsidreth nat that he is in syn, or recketh nat y<SUP>t</SUP> he is in syn, which is the hardines of y<SUP>e</SUP> de¦uyl. That other spece of enuy is, whan that a mā denyeth trouth, whā he knoweth that it is trouth, &amp; also whā he repenteth y<SUP>e</SUP> grace that God hath yeue to his neyghbour: &amp; all this is by enuy. Certes, thā is enuy y<SUP>e</SUP> worst sinne that is, for sothly al other sinnes be sō¦time onely ayenst o speciall vertue: but cer∣tes, enuy is against al vertues &amp; al goodnes For it is sory ayenst al boūties of her neigh¦bour, &amp; in this maner, it is diuers from al o∣ther synnes. Alas: for there ne is any synne that it ne hathe some delyte in it selefe, saue only enuy, that euer hath in it selfe anguishe &amp; sorow. The speces of enuy ben these, there is fyrste sorowe of other mennes goodnesse and of her prosperitie, &amp; prosperite is kynd∣lye mater of ioye: Than is enuye a synne a∣yenst kynde. The seconde spece of enuye, is ioy of other mennes harme, and that is pro¦perly lyke to the deuyll, that euer reioyseth hym of mannes harme. Of these two spe∣ces cometh bacbytynge, and thys synne of bacbytynge or detractynge hathe certayne speces, as thus: Some man prayseth hys neyghboure by a wycked entent, for he ma∣keth alwaye a wycked knot at the last ende: alway he maketh a but at the last ende that is digne of more blame, thā is worth al the praysyng. The seconde spece is, that if a mā be good, or doth or sayeth a thynge to good entente, the backbyter woll turne al y<SUP>t</SUP> good∣nesse vp so downe, to hys shreude entente. The thyrde is to amynishe the bountye of hys neyghbour. The fourth spece of backby¦tyng is thys, that yf men speke goodnesse of a man, than woll the backbiter saye: Perfay such a man is yet better than he, in dispray∣synge of hym y<SUP>e</SUP> men prayse. The fyfth spece is thys, for to cōsent gladly and herkē glad∣ly to y<SUP>e</SUP> harme that men speke of other folke: Thys synne is ful great, and aye encreseth after the wycked entent of the backbiter. Af∣ter backbytynge cometh grutching or mur∣muration, and somtyme it spryngeth of un∣pacience ayenst God, and somtyme ayenst man. Ayenst God it is whan a man grut∣cheth ayenst payne of hel, or ayenst pouertie or losse of catel, or ayenst rayne or tempeste, or els grutcheth that shrewes haue prospe∣rite, or els for that good mē haue aduersite: and all these thynges shulde men suffre pa∣ciently, for they come by the ryghtfull iudge¦ment and ordinaunce of God. Somtime co¦meth grutching of auarice, as Iudas grut∣ched ayenst Maudelen, whan she anoynted the heed of our lorde Iesu Christe, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> precious oyntment. Thys maner murmu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rynge is suche, as whan man grutcheth of goodnes that hym selfe doth, or that other folke done of her owne catel. Somtyme co∣meth murmure of pride, as whan Symon the pharisee grutched ayenst Maudeleyn, whan she aproched to Iesu Christ &amp; wepte at hys fete for her synnes. And somtyme it sourdeth of enuy, whā mē discouer a mans harme y<SUP>t</SUP> was priuy, or bereth him on hand a thing that is false. Murmure also is ofte among seruaūtes y<SUP>e</SUP> grutche whā her soue∣raynes byd hem do lefull thynges, &amp; for as much as they dare not opēly wythsay y<SUP>e</SUP> cō∣maūdemēt of her soueraynes, yet woll they say harme &amp; grutche &amp; murmure priuely for very dispite: which wordes they cal the dy∣uels pater noster, though so be that the dy∣uel had neuer pater noster, but y<SUP>t</SUP> lende folke yeueth it such a name. Somtyme it cometh of yre or pryuy hate, y<SUP>t</SUP> nourysheth rancoure in the herte, as afterwarde I shall declare. Than cometh also bytternesse of herte, tho∣rowe
<PB N="cviii" REF="120"/>
whych bytternesse euery good dede of hys neyghboure semeth to hym bitter &amp; vn∣sauery. Than cometh discorde that vnbyn∣deth al maner of frendshyp. Than cometh scornyng of hys neyghbour, all do he neuer so well. Than cometh accusynge, as whan man seketh occasion to anoy his neighbour whych is lyke the craft of the dyuel, y<SUP>t</SUP> way∣teth both daye and nyght to accuse vs all. Than cometh malignitie, through whyche a man anoyeth hys neyghbour priuely if he may: and yf he may not algate hys wycked wyll shall not let as for to brenne his house priuely, or enpoyson or sle hys beastes, and semblable thynges. Nowe woll I speke of the remedye ayenst thys foule synne of en∣uy. First is the loue of God principally, and louyng of hys neyghbour as hym selfe: for sothly that one ne may not be wythout that other. And truste well that in the name of thy neyghbour thou shalte vnderstande the name of thy brother, for certes all we haue one father fleshly &amp; one mother, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to saye, Adam &amp; Eue, &amp; also one father spirituell y<SUP>t</SUP> is God of heuen. Thy neyghboure art thou bounde for to loue, &amp; wyll him all goodnesse &amp; therfore sayth god: loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to saye, to saluatiō both of lyfe &amp; soule. And moreouer thou shalte loue hym or worde &amp; in benigne admonyshynge &amp; cha¦stysyng, &amp; comforte him in his noyaunces, &amp; pray for him with al thy hert. And in dede thou shalte loue him in such wyse that thou shalt do to him in charitie, as thou woldest that it were done to thine owne person: and therfore thou ne shalt do hym no damage in wicked worde, ne harme in his bodye ne in his catel, ne in hys soule by entysyng of wic¦ked ensample. Thou shalte not desyre hys wyfe ne none of hys thynges. Vnderstande also that in the name of neyghbour is com∣prehēded hys enemy: Certes man shal loue hys enemy by the commaundement of God and sothly thy frende thou shalt loue in god. I saye thine enemy shalt thou loue for god∣des sake▪ by hys cōmaūdemēt, for if it were reason that man shulde hate his enemy, for∣soth god wolde not receyue vs to hys loue y<SUP>t</SUP> ben hys enemies. Ayenst thre maner of wrō∣ges that his enemy doth to him, he shall do thre thynges, as thus: ayenst hate &amp; rācour of hert, he shal loue hym in hys hert: Ayenst chiding &amp; wicked wordes, he shall praye for his enemy: Ayenst wicked dedes, he shal do him bountie. For Christe sayeth: Loue your enemies, &amp; pray for hem y<SUP>t</SUP> speke you harme &amp; for hem that chase and pursue you: and do bounte to hem y<SUP>t</SUP> hate you. Lo, thus cōmaū∣deth vs our Lorde Iesu Christ to do to our enemies: For soth nature driueth vs to loue our frendes, and parfay our enemyes haue more nede of loue than our frendes, &amp; they y<SUP>t</SUP> more nede haue, certes to hem shall men do goodnesse. And certes in that dede haue we remembraunce of the loue of Iesu Christ y<SUP>t</SUP> dyed for hys enemyes: And in asmuche as that loue is more greuous to perfourme, so much is the more gret the merite, &amp; therfore the louyng of our enemye hath cōfounded y<SUP>e</SUP> dyuels venym: For ryght as the dyuel is cō¦founded by humilitie, righte so is he woun∣ded to the deth by the loue of our enemy, cer¦tes thā is loue the medicyn that casteth out the venym of enuie fro mannes herte.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter enuye wol I discriue the synne of Ire, for sothly who so hath enuye vpon hys neyghbour, anone he woll comenlye fynde hym a mater of wrathe in word or in dede, ayenst hym to whō he hath enuye: And as wel cometh ire of pride as of enuy, for sothly he that is proud or enuyous is lyghtly wrothe. Thys synne of yre, after the discriuynge of saynte Austyn is wycked wyll to be auēged by worde or by dede. Ire after the phylosopher, is the feruent bloude of mā yquycked in hys hert, through which he wolde harme to hym that he hateth: for certes the herte of man by eschaufynge and mouyng of hys bloude, wexeth so troubled that it is out of al maner of iugement of rea¦son. But ye shal vnderstande y<SUP>e</SUP> ire is in two maners, that one of hem is good, &amp; that o∣ther is wicked. The good ire is by ielousye of goodnes, through which a mā is wrothe with wickednes, &amp; ayenst wickednesse. And therfore saith a wise man, that ire is bet thā playe. This ire is with debonairte, and it is wroth without bitternes, not wroth ayenst the man, but wrath with the misdede of the
<PB REF="121"/>
man: As saith the prophete Dauid: Irasci∣mini, et nolite peccare. Nowe vnderstande that wicked ire is in two maners, that is to saye, sodayn ire or hasty ire wythout auyse∣ment &amp; consentyng of reason: The meaning and the sence of this is, that the reason of a mā ne cōsent not to that sodayne ire, &amp; than it is venyal. Another ire is ful wycked, that cometh of felony of hert, auysed and cast be∣fore, wyth wicked wyl to do vengeaunce, &amp; therto his reason cōsenteth: and sothly thys is deedly synne. Thys ire is so displeasaunt to God, that it troubleth hys house, &amp; cha∣seth the holy goste out of mans soule, &amp; wa∣steth &amp; distroyeth that likenesse of God, that is to say the vertue of that is in mans soule and putteth in hym the lykenesse of the dy∣uel, and taketh the man fro God that is his rightful lord. This is a ful great pleasaūce to the dyuell, for it is the dyuels fournayes that is eschaufed with the fyre of hell: For certes ryght so as fyre is more myghtye to distroy erthly thinges thā any other elemēt ryght so ire is myghty to distroy al spiritu∣el thynges. Loke how that fyre of smale co∣les that ben almost deed vnder asshen, woll reuyue or quycke ayen whan they bene tou∣ched wyth brymstone, right so ire wol euer∣more quyck ayen whan it is touched by the pride that is couered in mans hert. For cer∣tes fyre ne maye not come out of nothynge, but yf it were first in the same thinge natu∣rally: as fyre is drawe out of flyntes wyth stele. And ryght so as pride is many tymes mater of ire, ryghte so is rancour nourice &amp; keper of ire. There is a maner tree, as sayth saynt Isodore, y<SUP>t</SUP> whan a man maketh fyre of the sayd tree, &amp; couer the coles of it wyth asshen, sothly the fyre of it wol last a yere or more: And right so fareth it of rācoure whā it is ones conceyued in the hertes of some men, certes it wol last perauēture from one Ester day vntyl another Ester day or more But certes that same man is ful ferre from the mercy of god al that whyle. In this for∣sayde dyuels fourneis there forge thre shre∣wes: Pride that aye bloweth &amp; encreaseth the fyre by chiding &amp; wicked wordes: Than standeth enuy &amp; holdeth hote yron in y<SUP>e</SUP> fyre vpon the hert of man with a payre of longe tonges of long rācour. And thā stādeth the syn of cōtumely or strife &amp; chest, &amp; battereth and forgeth by vilaynous repreuinges. Cer¦tes this cursed syn anoyeth both to the man hym selfe &amp; also hys neyghbour. For sothly almoost al the harme or damage that anye mā doth to his neighbour cōmeth of wrath for certes outragious wrath dothe all that euer the foule fende willeth or cōmaundeth hym, for he ne spareth neither our lorde Ie∣su Christe, neyther his swete mother. And in hys outragiouse angre &amp; yre, alas alas, ful many &amp; diuers at that time, feleth in his hert ful wickedly both of Christ and also of al his halowes: Is not this a cursed vice? yes certes. Alas it taketh fro mā his witte &amp; hys reason, and all his debonayre lyfe spi∣rituell that shulde kepe his soule. Certes it wythdraweth also goddes dewe lordshyp, and that is mans soule, and the loue of hys neighbours. It stryueth also all day ayenst trouth, it reueth him the quyete of his hert, &amp; subuerteth hys soule. Of tre cōmeth these stinkinge engendrures. First hate, y<SUP>t</SUP> is olde wrath discord, through which a man forsa∣keth his olde frend y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath loued ful long And than cometh warre and euerye maner of wrong that a mā doth to his neyghbour in body or in catell. Of this cursed syn of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cometh also māslaughter. And vnderstand wel that homicide, that is manslaughter is in diuers wyse.</P>

Homicede is also by backebytynge, of whyche backebytinge say∣eth Salomon, that they haue two sweat∣des, wyth whych they slee her neyghbours For sothlye as wycked is to take from hym hys good name as hys lyfe. Homicide is also in geuing of wycked counsel by fraude as for to geue counsayle to areyse wrong∣full customes, and talages.

is when thou sleest hym wyth thy tonge: An other maner is, when thou com∣maundest to slee a mā, or els yeuest coūsayle to slee a man. Manslaughter in dede is in foure maners. That one is by lawe, ryghte as a Iustyce dampneth hym that is coulpa∣ble to the death: But let the Iustice be ware that he do it ryghtfully, &amp; that he do it not for delyte to spyll bloode, but for kepyng of rygh¦teousnes. An other homicide is done for ne∣cessitie, as when a mā sleeth an other in his defence, and that he ne maye none otherwyse escape wythout slaughter of hys aduersary, he doth synne, and he shal beare penaunce as for deedly synne. Also yf a man by case or ad∣uenture shote an arowe or caste a stone, with whych he sleeth a man, he is an homicide. Al so if a womā by negligēce ouerlieth her child in her slepynge, it is homicide &amp; deedly synne Also when a man distourbleth conception of a chylde, and maketh a woman eyther ba∣reyne by drynkynge of venymous herbes, thorough whyche she maye not conceyue, or sletth a chylde by drynkes, or els putteth cer∣tayne materiall thynges in her secre places to slee the chylde, or els doth vnkyndly synne by whyche a man or a womā shedeth her na∣ture in maner or in a place there as a chylde maye not be conceyued. Or els yf so be that a woman hathe conceyued, and hurteth her selfe, and by that myshap the chylde is slayne yet it is homicide. What saye we of those women that murtheren her chyldren for by∣cause of eschewynge of worldly shame? Cer∣tes it is an horryble homicide. Homicide is also yf a man approche to a womā by desyre of lecherye, thorough whyche the chylde is peryshed, or els smyteth a woman wetyngly throughe whyche she leseth her chylde: All these bene homicides and horrible dedly syn∣nes. Yet come there of yre mo synnes, as well in worde as in thought, and dede: As he that arretteth vpon God, or blameth god of the thynge of whych he is hym selfe gylty or dyspyseth God and all hys halowes, as done the cursed hasardours in dyuers coun∣treyes: Thys cursed synne done they, when they fele in her herte ful wyckedly of God &amp; of hys halowes. Also when they treate vn∣reuerentlye the sacrament of the aulter, that synne is so great that vnneth it may be relea¦sed, but that the mercy of God passeth al hys werkes it is so greate and he so benygne. Then commeth of yre an atterly anger, whē a man is sharpelye amoneshed in hys shryfte to leaue hys synne: Then woll he be angry and answere hokerlye and angerlye, or de∣fende or excuse hys synne by vnstedfastnesse of hys fleshe, or elles he dydde it for to holde companye wyth hys felowes, or elles he say¦eth the fende entyced hym, or elles he dothe it for hys youth, or elles his complexion is so coragious that he maye not forbeare, or elles it is hys destenye he sayeth vnto a certayne age, or elles he sayeth it commeth hym of gē∣tylnesse of hys aūcesters, and semblable thyn¦ges. All these maner of folke so wrappe hem in her synnes, that they ne woll not delyuer hym selfe: For sothlye no wyghte that excu¦seth hym selfe wylfullye of hys synne, maye not be delyuered of hys synne tyl that he me∣kelye beknoweth hys synne. After thys then commeth swearynge, that is expresse a∣gaynste the commaundemente of God, and thys befalleth often of angre and of yre. God sayeth: Thou shalte not take the name of thy Lorde God in vayne or in ydell. Also oure Lorde Iesu Christe sayeth by the worde of saynte Mathewe: Ne wyll ye not sweare in all maner, neyther by heauen, for it is goddes trone, ne by earth, for it is the benche of his feete, ne by Hierusalem, for it is the cytie of a greate kynge, ne by thyne heed, for thou mayste not make an heere neyther whyte ne blacke: but say by youre worde, yea yea, naye naye: and what that is more, it is of yuell. Thus sayeth Christe. For Chri∣stes sake sweare not so synfullye in dysmem∣brynge of Christe: By soule, herte, bones, and bodye, for certes it semeth that ye thynke that the cursed Iewes ne dysmembred not y∣noughe the preciyous persone of Christe, but ye dysmembre hym more. And yf so be that the lawe compell you to sweare, then ruleth you after the lawe of God in your swearyng as sayeth Ieremy the fourth chapter. Thou shalte kepe thre condicions, thou shalt swere in trouth, in dome &amp; in ryghtwysenesse, thys is to saye, thou shalte sweare sothe. For eue∣rye lesynge is ayenst Christ, for Christ is ve∣rye trouth. And thynke well thys that eue¦rye great swearer not compelled laufully to swere, the plage shal not depart fro his house whyle he vseth suche vnlawfull swearynge.
<PB REF="122"/>
Thou shalte swere also in dome, when thou arte constrayned by thy domes man to wyt∣nesse trouthe: Also thou shalt not sweare for enuye, neyther for fauoure, neyther for mede or rewarde, but onelye for ryghteousnesse &amp; for declarynge of it to the honoure and wor∣shyppe of God, and to the aydinge and helpe of thyne euen christen. And therfore euerye man that taketh goddes name in ydel, or fal∣selye sweareth wyth hys mouthe, or els ta∣keth on hym the name of Christe to be called a christen man, and lyueth ayenst Christes ly¦uynge and hys teachynge, all they take god∣des name in ydell. Loke also what sayeth saynt Peter, Actuum. iiij. Capitu. Non est aliud nomē sub celo. &amp;c. There is none other name sayeth saynt Peter vnder heauen yeue to men, in whyche they maye be saued, that is to saye, but the name of Iesu Christ. Take hede eke howe precious is the name of Iesu Christ, as sayeth saynt Paule, ad Philippen¦ses secundo. In nomine Iesu. &amp;c. That in the name of Iesu euery knee of heauenly creatu∣res, earthlye, and of hell shulde bowe, for it is so hye and so worshypfull, that the cursed fende in hel shulde tremble to heare it named Then semeth it that men that sweare so hor∣riblye by hys blessed name, that they dyspyse it more boldely then the cursed Iewes, or els the dyuell that trembleth whē he heareth hys name.</P>
<P>Nowe certes syth that swearyng, but yf it be lawfullye done, is so hyelye defended: moche more is forswearynge falslye, and yet nedelesse.</P>
<P>What say we also of hem that delyte hem in swearynge, and holde it a genterye or a māly dede to sweare great othes? And what of hem y<SUP>t</SUP> of very vsage ne cease not to sweare greate othes, all be the cause not worthe a strawe? Certes thys is horrible synne. Swe¦rynge sodeynly is also a great synne. But let vs go now to that horrible synne swearynge of adiuration and coniuration, as done these false enchaūtours or nigromācers in basyns full of water, or in a bryght swearde, in a cer∣cle, in a fyre, or in the sholderbone of a shepe? I can not saye but that they done cursedly &amp; dampnably ayenst Christe, and all the fayth of holy churche.</P>
<P>What say we of hem y<SUP>t</SUP> beleue on Deuina¦les, as by flyghte or by noyse of byrdes or of beestes, or by sorte, by Geomācye, by dremes, by chyrkynge of dores or crakynge of houses, by gnawynge of rattes, &amp; suche maner wret∣chednesse▪ Certes al these thynges ben defen¦ded by god and holy church, for whyche they bē accursed tyl they come to amendemēt y<SUP>t</SUP> on such fylth set her belyue. Charmes for woū∣des or maladye of men or of beestes, yf they take any effecte, it maye be perauenture that God suffreth it, for folke shuld yeue the more fayth and reuerence to hys name.</P>
<P>Nowe woll I speke of leasynges whych generally is false sygnifyaunce of worde in entent to dysceyue hys euen christen. Some lesynge is, of which there cometh none auaū∣tage to no wyght, and some leasyng turneth to the profyte or ease of o man, and to the da∣mage of an other man. An other leasynge is for to saue hys lyfe or hys catell, whych com∣meth of delyte for to lye, in which delyte they woll forge a longe tale, and paynt it wyth al circumstaunces, where al the tale of y<SUP>e</SUP> groūd is false. Some leasynge cometh for he woll susteyne hys wordes: Some leasyng cometh of retchelesnesse wythout auysemēt, and sem¦blable thynges. Lette vs nowe touche the vyce of flaterye, whyche ne cometh not glad∣lye but for drede, or for couetyse. Flatterye is generally wronful praysynge. Flaterers bene the dyuels nouryces, that noryshe, hys chyldren wyth mylke of losyngerye: Forsoth Salomon sayeth that Flatery is worse then detraction, for somtyme detractiō maketh an hauteyne man be the more humble, for he dre¦deth detraction, but certes flaterye maketh a man tenhaunce hys herte and countenaunce Flaterers be y<SUP>e</SUP> deuels enchaūtours, for they make a man to wene hym selfe be lyke, that he is not lyke. Those be lyke to Iudas that betraye a man to sell hym to hys enemy. Fla¦terers ben the dyuels chapleyns y<SUP>t</SUP> euer singe Placebo. I reken flatery in the vyces of yre for ofte tyme yf a man be wrothe wyth ano¦ther, then woll he flater some wyghte to sus¦tayne hym in hys quarell. Speake we nowe of suche cursynge as cometh of yrous herte Malyson generally maye be sayd euery ma∣ner power of harme: Such cursing bereueth man fro the raygne of God, as sayeth saynt Poule. And oft tyme such cursyng wrongful¦ly returneth ayen to him that curseth, as byrd that turneth ayen to hys owne neste. And
<PB N="cx" REF="122"/>
ouer all thynge men ought eshewe to curse her chyldren and yeue to the deuel her engen¦drure as farre forth as in hem is: certes it is great peryll and great synne. Lette vs then speake of chydynge and reproche, whych ben full great woundes in mās herte, for they vn¦sowe the semes of frendshyp in mans herte: for certes vnneth maye a man be playnly be accorded wyth hym, that hym openly hath re¦uyled and repreued, and dyslaundred: Thys is a full gastly synne as Christe sayeth in the gospell. And take hede nowe that he that re∣preueth hys neyghboure eyther he repreueth hym by some harme of paine that he hath vp¦pon hys body as mesell, croked, harlot, or by some synne that he doth. Now yf he repreue hym by harme of payne, then turneth the re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>efe to Iesu Christ: For payne is sende by the ryghtwyse sonde of God, and by hys suf∣fraunce, be it meselry, meyme, or maladye: And yf he repreue him vncharitably of synne as thou holour, thou dronkelewe harlot, and so forth. Then pertayneth that to the reioy∣synge of the deuell, whyche euer hath ioye y<SUP>t</SUP> men done synne. And certes chydynge maye not come but of vylaynous hert, for after the haboundaunce of the herte speaketh y<SUP>e</SUP> mouth full ofte. And ye shal vnderstande, that loke by any waye when any man shall chastyse or correct another, that he beware frō chydyng or repryuynge: for truely but he beware, he maye full lyghtlye quycken the fyre of angre and of wroth, whych he shulde quenche: And perauenture sleeth him whych he myght cha¦styse wyth benignite. For as sayeth Salomō The amiable tonge is the tree of lyfe, that is to saye, of lyfe spirituell. And sothlye a disso¦lute tonge sleeth the spirites of hym that re∣preueth, and also of hym whych is repreued Lo, what sayeth saynt Augustyne: There is nothynge so lyke the dyuels chylde, as he whych ofte chydeth.</P>
<P>A seruaunt of God behoueth not to chyde And thoughe that chydynge be a vyllainous thynge betwyxte all maner folke, yet it is cer¦tis moost vncouenable bytwene a man and hys wyfe, for there is neuer reste. And ther∣fore sayeth Salomon: An house that is vncouered and droppynge and a chydynge wyfe, ben a lyke.</P>
<P>A man whych is in a droppynge house in many places, though he eschewe the drop¦pynge in one place, it droppeth on hym in an other place: So fareth it by a chydynge wyfe, yf she chyde hym in one place she woll chyde hym in another: And therfore better and greatly more plesaunt is a morsell or ly∣tell gobet of bread wyth ioye, then an house fylled full of delyces wyth chydynge &amp; guer∣rynge, sayeth Salomon. Saynt Poule say¦eth: O ye women, beth ye subiecte to youre husbandes, as you behoueth and ought in God: And ye mē loueth your wyues, ad Co∣lossenses .iij.</P>
<P>Afterwarde speke we of scornyng whych is a wycked synne, and namely when he scor∣neth a man for hys good werkes: For certes suche scorners fare lyke the foule tode, that maye not endure to smell y<SUP>e</SUP> swete sauoure of the vyne whē it flourysheth. These scorners bene partynge felowes wyth the dyuell, for they haue ioye whē the dyuell wynneth, and sorowe yf he leseth. They ben aduersaryes of Iesu Christ, for they hate that he loueth, that is to saye, saluation of soule.</P>
<P>Speake we nowe of wycked counsayle, y<SUP>e</SUP> whych is a traytoure, for he dysceyueth hym that trusteth in hym: Vt Achitofel ad Salo¦monem. But nathelesse, yet is hys wycked counsayle fyrst ayenst hym selfe, for as sayeth the wyse man: euery false lyuynge hath this properte in hym selfe, that he that wol anoye another man, he anoyeth fyrst hym selfe. And men shall vnderstande, that man shall not take hys counsayle of false folke, ne of an¦grye folke, or greuous folke, ne of folke that loue specially to moche worldly folke, name∣ly in counsaylynge of soules.</P>
<P>Nowe cometh the synne of hem that sowe and make dyscorde amonge folke, whyche is a synne that Christ hateth vtterly, &amp; no won∣der is: for he deyde for to make concorde. And more shame do they to Christe then dyd they that hym crucifyed: For God loueth better that frendship be amonges folke then he dyd hys owne body, which that he gaue for vnite Therfore ben they lykened to the dyuell that euer be aboute to make dyscorde. Nowe com¦meth the synne of double tōge, such as speke fayre before folke, and wyckedly behynde, or els they make semblaūt as though they spak of good entencion, or els in game and playe, and yet they speake of wycked entent.</P>
<P>Nowe cometh hewrayenge of counsayle,
<PB REF="123"/>
through whych a man is dyffamed: Certes vnneth maye he restore the domage. Nowe cometh menace, that is an open folye, for he that ofte menaceth, he threateth more then he maye performe full ofte tyme. Nowe com¦meth ydell wordes, that is wythout profyte of hym that speaketh the wordes, and also of hym that herkeneth the wordes: Or els ydel wordes ben those that ben nedelesse or wyth out entent of naturall profyte. And all be it that ydell wordes be somtyme venyall synne yet shulde men doute hem, for we shall yeue rekenynge of hem before God. Now cometh ianglynge that maye not be wythout synne. And as sayeth Salomon: it is a sygne of a perte folye. And therfore a philosopher sayde when men asked hym howe that he shulde please the people, he answerde: Do many good workes and speake few vanities. After this cometh the synne of iaperies, that ben y<SUP>e</SUP> deuels apes, for they make folke to laughe at her iaperye, as folke do at the gaudes of an ape: whych iapes defendeth saynt Paule. Loke howe that vertuous wordes and holy comforte hem that trauayle in the seruyce of Christ: Ryght so comforteth the villaynous wordes and knackes of iapers hem, that tra∣uayle in the seruyce of the deuell. These bene the synnes of the tonge, that come of yre and of other synnes.</P>

<HEAD>The remedy ayenst Ire</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He remedy ayenst Ire, is a ver¦tue that men cal Mansuetude, that is Debonairie, and also another vertue that men clepe Pacience or sufferaunce. Debo∣nayrte wythdraweth and refrayneth the stee rynges and mouynges of mannes corage in herte, in suche maner that they ne skyppe not out by anger ne yre. Sufferaunce suffereth swetely all the anoyaunces and wronges y<SUP>e</SUP> men done to man outwarde. Saynt Ierome sayeth thys of debonairte, y<SUP>t</SUP> it doth no harme to no wyght, ne sayeth: ne for no harme that men do ne saye, he ne chafeth ayenst reason. Thys vertue somtyme cometh of nature: for as sayeth the philosopher, A man is a quycke thynge by nature, debonayre and tretable to goodnesse: but when debonairte is enformed of grace, then it is the more worth.</P>
<P>Pacience is another remedye ayenst ire, &amp; is a vertue that suffreth swetely euery man∣nes goodnesse, &amp; is not wroth for no harme that is done to hym. The philosopher sayeth that pacience is the vertue that suffreth debo¦nairly all the outrages of aduersite, and eue∣rye wycked worde. Thys vertue maketh a man lyke to God, and maketh hym goddes owne chylde: as sayeth Christ. Thys vertue dyscomfyteth thyne enemye. And therfore sayeth the wyse man: Yf thou wolde van∣quyshe thyne enemye learne to suffre. And thou shalte vnderstande that a man suffreth foure maner of greuaunces in outward thyn¦ges, ayenst the whyche foure he muste haue foure maner of paciences.</P>
<P>The fyrst greuaunce is of wycked wordes whyche suffred Iesu Christe wythout grut∣chynge full paciently, when the Iewes dys∣pysed hym full ofte. Suffre thou therfore pa¦ciently, for the wyse man sayeth: Yf thou stryue with a foole, though y<SUP>e</SUP> foole be wroth or though he laugh, alwaye thou shalte haue no reste. That other greuaunce outwarde is to haue domage of thy catell: There ayenst suffred Christ full paciently, whē he was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣poyled of al that he had in thys lyfe, and that was but hys clothes. The thyrde greuaunce is a man to haue harme in hys body: That suffred Christ full paciently in al his passion The fourth greuaunce is in outragious la∣boure in werkes▪ wherfore I saye, that folke that make her seruauntes to trauayle to gre∣uouslye or out of tyme, as in holy dayes, soth¦ly they do great synne. Here ayenst suffered Christ full paciently, and taught vs pacience when he bare vpon hys blessed shoulders the crosse, vpon which he shuld suffre dyspytous death. Here maye men learne to be paciēt, for certes not only Christen be paciente for loue of Iesu Christ, and for reward of blessed lyfe that is perdurable, but certes the olde pay∣nems that neuer were christened, cōmended and vsed the vertue of paciēce. A philosopher vpon a tyme that wolde haue beate his dysci¦ple for hys great trespace, for whych he was moued, &amp; brought a rodde to beate the chylde &amp; when this chyld sawe the rodde, he sayd to hys mayster: what thynke ye to do?

Forsoth sayd the may∣ster all wepynge, thou sayest soth: Haue thou the rodde my dere chylde, and correcte me for myne impacience. Of pacience cometh obedi∣ence, throughe whyche a man is obediente to Christ &amp; to al hem to which he ought be obe∣diēt in Christ. And vnderstand wel that obe∣dience is perfyte when that a man doth glad lye and hastely with good herte entierlye, all that he shulde do.

Enuye and yre maken bytternesse in herte▪ whych bytternesse is mother of accidie &amp; taketh fro hym the loue of al goodnesse, thē is accidie the anguyshe of trouble of herte. And saynt Augustyne sayeth: It is anoye of goodnesse and anoye of harme. Certes thys is a dampnable synne, for it doth wronge to Iesu Christ, in as moche as it benōmeth the seruyce that men ought do to Christe, as say∣eth Salomon: but accidie doth no suche dili∣gence. He doth all thynge wyth anoye &amp; with wrawnesse, slacknesse, and excusation: wyth ydelnesse and vnlust.</P>
<P>For whych the boke sayeth: Acursed be he that doth the seruice of god negligently. Thē is accidie enemye to euery estate of man. For certes the state of man is in thre maners.</P>
<P>Eyther it is in the estate of Innocency, as was the estate of Adam before that he fyll in to synne, in whych estate he was hold to wor¦ke, as in praysynge and laudynge God. And ther estate is y<SUP>e</SUP> estate of synfull mē: in which estate men bene holden to laboure in pray∣enge to God for amendement of her synnes, and that he woll graunte hem to ryse out of her synnes.</P>
<P>Another estate is the state of grace, in whi¦che state he is holden to workes of penitence: and certes to all these thynges is accidie con∣trary, for he loueth no busynesse at all. Nowe certes, thys foule synne accidie is also a full great enemye to the lyfelode of the body, for it ne hath no purueyaunce ayenst tēporel ne∣cessite, for it forswoleth, forslogeth, &amp; destroy∣eth al goodes temporel by rechelesnesse. The iiij. thynge is, that accidie is lyke hem y<SUP>e</SUP> bene in the payne of hel, bycause of her slouth and heuynesse: for they that be dampned bene so bounde, that they maye neyther well do ne thynke. Of accidie cometh fyrst that a man is anoyed and encombred to do any goodnesse, &amp; maketh y<SUP>e</SUP> God hath abhominacion of such accidie, as sayeth saynt Iohn. Nowe cometh slouth that wol nat suffre no hardnesse ne pe∣naunce: for sothly slouth is so teder and so de¦lycate, as sayeth Salomon, that he woll suf∣fre no hardnesse ne penaunce, and therfore he marreth all that he doth. Ayenst thys rotten synne of accidie &amp; slouth, shulde men exercise hem selfe &amp; vse hem to do good workes: and māly and vertuously catch corage to do, thyn kynge that our Lorde Iesu Christe quyteth euery good dede, be it neuer so lyte. Vsage of labour is a great thyng. For it maketh as say¦eth saynt Bernard, y<SUP>e</SUP> labourer to haue strōge armes and harde senewes: &amp; slouth maketh heuye, feble, and tender. Then cometh drede to begynne to worke any good workes. For certes he that enclyneth to synne, hym thyn∣keth it is so great an empryse for to vndertak the workes of goodnesse, and casteth in hys herte, that the circumstaunces of goodnesse bene so greuouse and weyghtye for to suffre, that he dare not vndertake to do workes of goodnesse, as sayeth saynt Gregorye.</P>
<P>Nowe cometh wanhope, that is dyspayre of the mercye of God, that cometh somtyme of to moch outragious sorow, and somtyme of to moch drede, ymaginynge that he hath do so moch synne, that it wol not auayle him tho he wolde repent hym and forsake synne: thorough whych dyspayre or drede, he aban∣doneth al hys herte to euery maner synne, as sayeth saynt Augustyne.

<P>Thys horrible synne is so peryllous, that he that is dyspayred there nys no felony ne no synne that he douteth for to do, as she∣wed well by Iudas. Certes aboue al synnes then is thys synne moost dyspleasaunt to Christ and moste aduersary. Sothly he that

Certes the mercy of God is euer redy to the penitent person, &amp; is aboue al hys werkes. Alas can not a mā bethynke hym on the gospel of saint Luke. xv. where as Christ sayeth, that as well shall there be ioye in hea¦uen vpon a synfull man that doth penitence, as vpon foure score &amp; nynetene ryghtful mē that nede no penitence. Loke ferther in the same gospell the ioye and y<SUP>e</SUP> feest of the good man that had loste hys sonne, whē hys sonne wyth repentaunce was retourned to hys fa∣ther. Can they not remembre hem also, that (as sayeth saynt Luke) capi. xxx. Howe that the thefe that was hāged besyde Iesu Christ sayd: Lorde remembre me, when thou com∣mest in to thy reygne. Forsoth sayd Christ, I saye to the: To daye shalte thou be with me in paradyse. Certes, there is none so horrible synne of man, that ne maye in hys lyfe be dys¦troyed by penitence, thorough vertue of pas∣syon and of the death of Christe. Alas what nede men then to be dyspayred, syth that hys mercy is so ready and large? Aske and haue. Then commeth sompnolence, that is slug∣gye slombrynge, whyche maketh a man he∣uy and dull in body and in soule, &amp; this sinne cometh of slouth: And certes the time that by waye of reason man shulde not slepe, is by y<SUP>e</SUP> morowe, but yf there were cause reasonable. For sothely the morowe tyde is most couena¦ble a man to saye hys prayers, &amp; for to thāke God, and to honoure God, &amp; to yeue almesse to the poore, that cometh fyrst in the name of Iesu Christ. Lo, what sayth Salomō? who so woll by the morowe awake to seke me, he shall fynde me. Then cometh neglygence or retchelesnesse, that recketh of nothynge. And though that ignoraunce be mother of al har∣mes, certes neglygence is the noryce. Negli∣gence ne dothe no force when he shall do a thynge, whether he do it well or euell. The remedye of these two synnes is, as sayeth the wyse man: That he that dredeth God spa∣reth not to do that he ought to do, and he that loueth god he woll do dylygēce to please god by hys werkes, and abādone hym selfe wyth al hys myght wel for to do. Thē cometh ydel¦nesse, that is the yate of all harmes. An ydell man is lyke to a place that hath no walles, y<SUP>e</SUP> dyuell maye entre on euerye syde, or shote at hym that is dyscouert, by temptation on eue¦ry syde. Thys ydelnesse is the thorruke of all wycked and vylayne thoughtes, and of al or∣dure. Certes the heauen is yeue to hem that wyll laboure, and not to ydell folke. Also Da¦uid sayeth, that they ne be not in the laboure of men, ne they shall not be whypped wyth men.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter Accidie woll I speke of Auarice, and of couetyse. Of whych syn saynt Poule sayth the rote of al harmes is coue∣tyse, ad Timoth. vi. For soth∣ly whan the hert of man is cō¦founded in it selfe and troubled, and that the soule hath lost the confort of god, than seketh he an ydell solace of worldlye thynges. Aua∣rice, after the discryption of saynt Augustyn, is a lycorousnesse in hert to haue erthly thyn∣ges. Some other folke saye, that auaryce is for to purchace many erthely thynges, &amp; no∣thynge to yeue to hem that haue nede.</P>
<P>And vnderstonde that auarice stōdeth nat onely in londe ne catel, but somtyme in sciēce and glorye, &amp; in euerye maner of outragious thynges is Auaryce. And couetyse is thys. Couetyse is for to coueit suche thynges that thou hast nat. And auarice is to with holde &amp; kepe suche thynges as thou haste wythout right. Sothly this auarice is a synne that is ful dāpnable, for al holy writ curseth it, &amp; spe¦keth ayenst y<SUP>e</SUP> vice, for it doth wrong to Iesu christ: for it taketh fro him the loue that men to hym owe, &amp; tourneth it backeward ayenst al reason, and maketh that the auarycious man hath more hoope in hys catell, than in Iesu Christ, and dothe more obseruaunce in kepyng of hys treasour, than he dothe in the seruyce of Iesu Christ. And therfore saythe saynt Poule, ad Ephesios quinto: That an auarycious man is the thraldome of idola∣trye. What dyfference is there betwyxt an ydolaster and an auaricyous man? But that an ydolaster perauenture ne hathe nat but a mawmet or two, &amp; the auaricious man hath many. For certes euery floreyn in hys co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, is his maumet. And certes the synne of mau∣metry is the fyrste that God defended, as in the .x. commaūdements it beareth wytnesse, in Exodi Capitu. xx. Thou shalte haue no false goddes before me, ne thou shalte make to the no graue thynge. Thus is an auarici∣ous man, that loueth hys treasour before God, an idolaster. And through this cursed synne of Auyryce and Couetyse, cometh these harde lordeshyppes, through whyche they ben streyned by tyllages, customes, and ca∣riages, more than her duetye or reason is, or elles take they of her bondmen amercya∣mentes, whyche myght more resonablye be

called extortions than mercyamentes. Of whiche amerciamentes or raunsomynge of bondmen, some lordes stewardes say that it is rightful, for as moche as a churle hath no temporel thynge, that it ne is his lordes, as they saye. But certes these lordshyppes do wrong, that bereue theyr bondmen thynges that they neuer yaue hem. Augustinus de Ciuitate dei. Libro. ix. Sothe is, that the con¦ditiō of thraldom, and the fyrst cause of thral∣dome was for synne.</P>
<P>Thus may ye se, that thoffence deserued thraldome, but nat nature. Wherfore these lordes ne shulde not moche glorifye hem in her lordeshyps, sythe that they by natural cō∣dycion ben not lordes ouer thralles, but for that thraldome came fyrste by the deserte of synne. And more ouer there as the law sayth, that temporel goodes of bonde folke ben the goodes of her lorde: ye, that is for to vnder∣stonde, the goodes of the Emperour, to de∣fende hem in her ryght, but not to robbe hem ne reue hem. Therfore saythe Seneca: thy prudence shulde lyue benygnly with y<SUP>e</SUP> thral∣les. Those that thou callest thy thralles, ben goddes people: and for humble people ben Christes frendes, they ben contubernyall w<SUP>t</SUP> the lordes. Thynke also that of suche sede as chorles sprynge, of suche sede spryng lordes: as wel may the chorle be saued as the lorde. The same dethe that taketh the chorle, suche dethe taketh the lorde. Wherfore I rede do right so with the chorle as thou woldest that thy lorde dyd wyth the yf thou were in hys plyght. Euery synful man is a chorle to syn: I rede the lorde certes, that thou werke in suche wyse with thy chorles, that they rather loue the thā drede the. I wote wel that there is degree aboue degree, as reson is, and skyll is that men do her deuoyre there as it is due: But certes extorcions and dispyte of your vn¦derlynges is dampnable. And ferthermore vnderstonde wel, that these conquerours or tyrauntes make ful ofte thralles of hem that ben borne of as royal bloode as ben they that hem conquere. This name of thraldom was neuer erst knowe, tyl that Noe sayd that his sonne Canam shulde be thral to his brethern for hys synne. What saye we than of hē that pyl and do extorcions to holy church: Certes the swerde that men yeue fyrste to a knyght, whan he is newe dubbed, sygnyfyeth that he shulde defende holy churche, and not robbe and pyl it, and who so doth he is traytour to Chryst. And as saythe saynt Austyn, they ben the dyuels woulues that strangle the shepe of Iesu christ, and done worse than woulues for sothely whan the woulfe hathe full hys wombe, he stynteth to strangle shepe: But sothlye the pyllours and dystroyers of holy church goodes ne do not so, for they ne stynte neuer to pyll. Nowe as I haue sayde, sythe so is that synne was fyrste cause of thraldom than is it thus, that at the tyme that all thys world was in synne, thā was al this worlde in thraldom and in subiection, but certes syth the tyme of grace came, god ordayned y<SUP>t</SUP> some folke shulde be more hye in estate and in de∣gre, and some folke more lowe, and that eche shulde be serued in hys astate. And therfore in some coūtreys there they be thralles, whā they haue turned hem to y<SUP>e</SUP> faythe, they make her thralles free out of thraldome, and ther∣fore certes the lorde oweth to hys man that the man oweth to the lorde. The pope cal∣leth hym selfe seruaunte of the seruauntes of God, but for as the estate of holy churche ne might not haue ben, ne the comen profyte myght not haue be kept, ne peace ne reste in erthe, but yf god had ordayned that some mā had hier degree and some men lower. Ther∣fore was soueraynte ordayned to kepe, mayn¦tayne, and defende her vnderlynges and her subiectes in reason, as ferforth as it lyeth in her power, and not to distroye ne confounde hem. Wherfore I say, that those lordes that ben lyke wolues that deuour the possessyons or the catel of poore folkes wrongfully, with out mercy or mesure, they shal receyue be the same mesure y<SUP>t</SUP> they haue mesured to poore folke, the mesure of Iesu Christ but it be a∣mended. Nowe cometh disceyte betwixt mar¦chaunt and marchaunt. And thou shalt vn∣derstonde that marchaundyse is in two ma∣ners, that one is bodily, and that other is goostly: that one is honest and leful and that other is dishonest and vnleful.</P>
<P>The bodily marchaundyse that is lefull &amp; honest is thys: that there as god hath orday∣ned that a reygne or a countreye is suffysaūt to hym selfe, than it is honeste and lefull that of haboundaunce of hys countrey, men helpe an other countrey that is nedy: And therfore there muste be merchaūtes to bring
<PB N="cxiii" REF="125"/>
fro one countrey to that other her marchaun¦dyse.</P>
<P>That other marchaundyse that mē haun∣ten with fraude, and trecherye, and disceyte, with leasynges and false othes, is right cur∣sed and dampnable. Espirituel marchaun∣dyse is properly Symonye, that is ententife desyre to bye any thynge espyrituel, that is a thynge whyche apertayneth to the sayntua∣rye of God, and to cure of the soule. This de∣syre yf so be that a man do hys dilygence to perfourme it, al be it that hys desyre ne take non effecte, yet it is to him a deedlye synne, &amp; yf he be ordred, he is irreguler. Certes sy∣monye is called of Symon Magus, that wolde haue bought for temporell catell the yefte that God had yeue by the holy goost to saynt Peter and to the Apostels: And ther∣fore vnderstonde that he that selleth and he that byethe thynges espyrituels, ben called Symonyakes, be it by catell, be it by procu∣ring or by fleshly prayer of his frendes, flesh∣ly frendes or espyrituell frendes, flesshly in two maners, as by kynred or other frendes: Sothlye yf they praye for hym that is not worthy and able, it is symonye yf he take the benefice, and yf he be worthy and able there is none. That other maner is whan man or woman prayeth for folke to auaunce hem on¦ly for wycked fleshly affection, whyche they haue vnto the persons, and that is foule sy∣monye. But certes in seruyce, for which men yeuen thinges espyrituel vnto her seruaūtes it must be vnderstonde that the seruice muste be honest, or els not, and also that it be with∣out bargeynyng, and that the person be able. For as sayth saynt Damasen: Al the synnes of the worlde at regarde of this synne, are as a thyng of naught, for it is the greatest synne that may be after the synne of Lucifer and of Antichrist: For by this synne God forleseth the churche and the soule whyche he bought wyth hys precious bloode, by hem that yeue churches to hem that bē not worthy, for they put in theues hondes that steale the soules of Iesu Christ, and distroy hys patrimony. By suche vnworthy preestes and curates haue lende men lesse reuerence of the sacramentes of holy churche, and such yeuers of churches put the chyldren of Christ out, and put in the churche the dyuels owne sonnes: they sel the soules that lambes shulde kepe to the wolfe which strangleth hem, and therfore shal they neuer haue parte of the pasture of lambes, that is the blysse of heuen. Nowe cometh ha∣sardrie wyth hys apertenauntes, as tables and rafles, of whyche cometh disceyte, false othes, chydynges, and al rauynesse, blasphe∣mynges, and renyenges of God, and hate of hys neyghbours, waste of goodes, myspen∣dynge of tyme, and somtyme manslaughter. Certes hasardours ne mowe not be without great synne. Of auarice cometh also lesynges theft, false wytnesse, and false othes: and ye shall vnderstonde that these be great synnes, and expresse ayenst the commaundementes of God, as I haue sayd. False wytnesse is in worde, and also in dede: In worde as for to byreue thy neyghboures good name by thy false wytnesse, or byreue hym his catel or his herytage, by thy false wytnessyng, whā thou for yre or for mede, or for enuye, bearest false wytnesse, or accusest him, or excusest thy selfe falsly. Ware ye questmongers and notaries: Certes for false wytnessynge was Susan in ful great sorowe &amp; payn, and manye another mo. The syn of thefte is also expresse ayenst goddes hest, &amp; in two maners, corporell and spirituel, the temporel theft is: As for to take thy neyghbours catel ayenst his wyl, be it by force or by sleight, be it by mette or by mesure by stealynge also of false endytementes vpō hym and in borowyng of thy neyghbours ca¦tell, in entent neuer to paye it ayen, and sem∣blable thynges. Espyrituel thefte is sacry∣lege, that is to say, hurtyng of holye thynges sacred to Christ in two maners, by reason of the holy place, as churches or churche yerdes For which euery villaynous synne that men don in suche places maye be called sacrylege, or euerye vyolence in the semblable places. Also that they withdrawe falsely the rightes that longe to holye churche and pleasynge. And generally sacrilege is to reue holy thing fro holye place, or vnholye thynge out of ho∣lye place, or holy thynge out of vnholy place.</P>

<P>Saynt Iohan saythe, that auoutrers shalbe in hell in a stacke brennynge of fyre and of brimstone for the stenche of her ordure: Cer∣tes the brekynge of this sacrament is an hor∣ryble thyng: It was made of God hym selfe in paradyse, and confermed by Iesu Christ, as wytnesseth saynt Mathewe in the gospel: A man shall leaue father and mother &amp; take hym to hys wyfe, and they shalbe two in one flesh.</P>
<P>Thys sacrament betokeneth the knyttyng togyther of Chryste and holye churche.

A man shulde loue his wyfe by discrecyon, paciently and attemperatlye, and than is she as though it were his suster. The fyfthe fyngre of the dyuels honde is the stynkynge dede of lecherye. Truely the fyue fyngers of glotonye the dyuell putteth in to the wombe of a man: And wyth his fyue fyn¦gers of lecherye he grypeth hym by y<SUP>e</SUP> reynes for to throwe hym in to the furneys of helle, there as they shal haue the fyre and the wor∣mes that euer shal laste, and wepynge and waylynge, and sharpe hungre and thurste, grymnesse of dyuels, whyche shal al to trede hem withouten ende. Of lecherye as I sayd sourdeth and springeth dyuers speces: As fornycacyon, that is bytwene man and wo∣man which be not maryed and is deedly syn, and ayenst nature: Al that is enemye and di∣struction to nature is ayenst nature. Perfay the reason of a man telleth him wel also that it is deedly synne, for as moche as god for∣bade lecherye. And saynte Poule yeueth hem the reygne that nis dewe to no wyght but to hem that done deedly synne. An other synne of lecherye is to byreue a maydes mayden∣hede, for he that so dothe, certes he casteth a mayden out of the hyest degre that is in thys presente lyfe, and byreueth her that precious frute that the boke calleth the hundred frutes I ne can saye it none other wyse in English, but in Latyn it hight (Centesimus fruct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.) Certes he that so dothe is cause of many da∣mages and vilanyes, mo than anye man can reken: ryght as he is cause of many damages somtyme that beestes do in the felde, that breke the hedge or the closure, through which he distroyeth that maye not be restored: For certes no more may mayden hede be restored than an arm that is smytte fro the body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y retourne ayen and were: She maye haue mercy, this wote I wel, yf that she haue wel to do penitence, but neuer shall it be that she nas corrupte. And all be it so y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue spaike somwhat of auoutry, also it is good to shew the perylles that longe to auoutrye, for to es∣chewe that foule synne. Auoutrye in latyn is for to saye, approchynge of an other mannes bedde, throughe whyche those that somtyme were one flesh, abandon her bodyes to other persones. Of thys synne as saythe the wyse man folowe many harmes: Firste breakynge of faythe, and certes in faythe is the keye of christendome: and whan that faythe is broke and loste, sothly christendom stout veyneard without fruite. Thys synne is also theft, for thefte generally is to reue a wight his thyng ayenst hys wyll. Certes thys is the foulest thefte that may be, whan that a womā stea∣leth her body fro her husbonde and yeueth it to her holour to defoyle her, and stealeth her soule fro Christ, and yeueth it to the dyuell: This is a fouler thefte than for to breake a church and steale away the chalyce, for these auouterers breke the temple of god spyrituel¦lye,
<PB N="cxv" REF="127"/>
and steale the vessell of grace, that is the body and the soule: For whyche Christ shall distroye hem, as sayth saynte Paule. Soth¦lye of thys thefte doubted greatlye Ioseph, whan that hys Lordes wyfe prayed hym of vylanye, whan he sayde: Lo my Ladye howe my Lorde hath take to me vnder my warde, all that he hathe in thys worlde, ne nothynge of hys thynges is out of my po∣wer, but only ye that be his wyfe: and how shulde I than do thys wyckednesse and syn so horrible ayenst God, and ayenst my lorde God it forbede. Alas, all to lytell is suche trouthe nowe founde. The thyrde harme is the fylthe, throughe whyche they breake the commaundemente of God, and defoyle the outer of matrymonye, that is Christe. For certes in so muche as the sacrament of ma∣ryage is so noble and so digne, so muche is it greater synne for to breake it: For God made maryage in Paradyse in the estate of innocencye, to multiply mankynde in the ser¦uice of God, and therfore is the breakynge therof the more greuous, of whiche breking come false heyres ofte time, that wrongful∣lye occupye folkes heritages, and therfore wol Christ put hem out of the reygne of he∣uen, that is herytage to good folke. Of thys breakyng cometh also oft time that folke vn¦ware wedde or synne wyth her owne kyn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed: and namely these harlottes that haunte bordels of these foule women, that maye be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ekened to a comune gonge, where as men pourge her ordure. what say we also of pu∣tours, that lyue by the horrible synne of pu∣trye, and constreyne women to yeue to hem a certeyne rente of her bodyly putery, yee sō∣tyme of hys owne wyfe or hys chylde, as done these baudes: Certes these bene cursed synnes. Vnderstande also that auoutrie is sette gladlye in the ten commaundementes bytwene thefte and man slaughter, for it is the greatest thrft y<SUP>t</SUP> may be, for it is thefte of bodye and of soule, and it is like to homicide for it kerueth a two and breketh a two hem that fyrst were made of one fleshe. And ther∣fore by the olde lawe of God they shulde be slaine, but nathlesse by y<SUP>e</SUP> law of Iesu Christ that is lawe of pytye, whan he sayde to the woman that was fonde in auoutrye, and shulde haue be slayne wyth stones after the wyll of the Iewes, as was her lawe: Go sayde Iesu Christe, and haue no more wyll to do sinne. Sothly the vengeaunce of auou¦trye is awarded to the paynes of hell, but if so be that it be distourbed by penitence. Yet bene there mo speces of thys cursed synne, as whan that one of hem is relygyouse or elles bothe, or of folke that bene entred in to ordre, as subdeaken, deaken, or Preeste, or hospitaliers. And euer the hyer that he is in ordre, the greater is the synne. The thyn∣ges that greatlye agredge her synne is the breaking of her auow of chastitie whā they receyued the order. And more ouer sothe is that holye order is chefe of all the treasorye of God and hys especial signe and maike of chastite, to shew that they ben ioyned to cha¦stitie, whych is the moost precious life that is: &amp; these ordred folke bene speciallye titled to God and of the special meyne of God, for whyche whan they done deedly synne they bene traytoures of God and of hys people, for they lyue of the people. Preestes ben an∣gels as by dignetie of her misterye, but for∣soth saynt Paule sayth y<SUP>t</SUP> Sathanas trans∣fourmeth hym in an angell of lyght. Soth∣ly the preest that haunteth deedly synne, he maye be lykened to the angell of derkenesse, transfourmed in the aungell of lyght, he se∣meth angel of lyght, but forsoth he is angel of derkenesse. Suche preestes be the sonnes of Helye, as sheweth in the boke of kynges, that they were the sonnes of Beliall, that is the dyuell. Beliall is to saye wythout iudge and so fare they, hem thynketh they be free and haue no iuge, no more than hathe a free bulle that taketh whiche cowe that hym ly∣keth in the towne. So fare they by wemen, for ryght as one free bulle is ynoughe for al a towne, ryghte so is a wycked preeste cor∣ruption ynoughe for all a paryshe, or for all a countre: These preestes, as sayth the boke ne can not ministre the mistery of presthode to the people, ne they knowe not God, they ne helde hem not apayed, as sayth the boke of sodeyne fleshe that was to hem offered, but they toke by force the flesshe that was raw. Certes, so that these shrewes ne helde hem not apayed of rosted and sodde fleshe, with which the people fedde hem in greate reuerence, but they wol haue rawe fleshe of folkes wyues and her doughters, &amp; certes these women y<SUP>t</SUP> cōsente to her harlotry done

great wronge to Christ and to holy church, al halowes, and al soules, for they byreue al these hem that shulde worshyp Christe, and holy churche, and praye for christen soules, and therfore haue such preestes and her lem mans also that consente to her lecherye, the cursing of al the court christen, til they come to amendemente. The thyrde spece of auou∣trye is somtyme betwixt a mā &amp; his wyfe, &amp; that is whan they take no regarde in her as¦semblynge, but only to her fleshly delyte, as sayeth saynt Ierome, &amp; ne reken of nothing but that they ben assēbled bycause they ben maryed, al is good ynough, as they thinke: but in suche folke hath the dyuell power, as sayde the angell Raphaell to Tobye, for in her assemblyng they put Iesu Christ out of her herte, and gyue her selfe to all ordure. The fourthe spece is the assēble of hem that bene of affinitie, or els of hem, wyth which her fathers or her kynred haue dealed in the synne of lecherye: Thys synne maketh hem lyke to houndes, that take no kepe to kynred And certes parentele is in two maners, ey∣ther ghostly or fleshly: gostly as for to deale wyth hys godsyb, for ryght so as he that en¦gendreth a chyld is hys fleshly father: right so is hys God father hys father espirituell: for whyche a woman maye in no lesse synne assemble wyth her godsyb, than wyth her owne fleshly brother. The fifth spece is that abhominable synne, of whyche abhomina∣ble syn no man vnneth ought speke ne write nathlesse it is openly rehersed in holy writ. Thys cursed synne done men and women in diuers entente and in diuers maner: But though that holy writ speke of horrible syn, certes holy writte maye not be defoyled, no more thā the sūne that shyneth on the dong∣hyll. Another synne apertayneth to lecherye that cometh sleping, &amp; this syn cometh often to hem that be maydens, &amp; also to hem that be corrupt, &amp; this syn mē cal Polucion, that commeth of thre maners: Somtime of lan∣guyshyng of body, for the humours bene to ranke &amp; aboundaunt in the body of man, sō∣time of infirmite, for feblenesse of the vertue retentife, as phisike maketh mencion: Som¦time for surfet of meate &amp; drinke, &amp; somtime of vylanous thoughtes that ben enclosed in mannes mynd whā he goeth to slepe which maye not be without synne, for whych men muste kepe hem wyselye, or elles maye men synne full greuously.</P>

Thys, as sayeth the boke, is a full greate sacramente, God made it as I haue sayd in paradyse, and wolde hym selfe be borne in mariage: and for to halowe ma∣ryage he was at a weddynge, where as he turned water in to wyne, whyche was the fyrste miracle that he wrought in earthe be∣fore hys disciples. Trew effecte of mariage clenseth fornication and replenysheth holye churche of good lynage, for that is the ende of mariage, and chaungeth deedly synne in to venyal sinne, bitwene hem that ben wed∣ded, &amp; maketh the hertes as one of hem that bene wedded, as well as the bodyes.</P>
<P>Very mariage was established by god er that syn began, whan naturall law was in his ryght poynt in Paradise. And it was ordayned that o man shulde haue but a wo∣man, and o womā but o man, as saith saint Augustyne, by many reasons.</P>
<P>Fyrste for mariage is figured betwixt Christ and holy churche.</P>
<P>Another is for a man is head of a wo∣mā alway by ordinaunce it shuld be so. For yf a womā had mo men thā one, than shuld she haue mo heedes thā one, and that were a ryght horrible synne before God, and also a woman myght not please so manye folke at ones: and also there shuld neuer be rest ne quiete amonge hem, for eche of hem wolde
<PB N="cxvi" REF="128"/>
aske her owne ryght. And furthermore, no man shulde know hys owne engendrure, ne who shulde haue hys heritage, and the wo∣man shulde be the lesse beloued.</P>
<P>Now cometh how that a man shulde bere hym wyth hys wyfe, &amp; namely in two thynges: that is to saye, in sufferaunce and reuerence, as shewed Christ whan he fyrste made womā. For he ne made her of y<SUP>e</SUP> heade of Adam, for she shulde not claym to greate lordshyp, for there as the woman hathe the maystrye, she maketh to muche variaunce, there nede no mo ensamples of thys, the ex∣perience al daye, ought ynough suffice.</P>
<P>Also certes, God ne made not woman of the fote of Adam, for she shuld not behold to lowe, for she can not paciently suffre: but God made woman of the rybbe of Adam, for woman shulde be felowe vnto man.</P>
<P>Man shulde beare hym to hys wyfe in fayth▪ in trouth, and in loue (as sayth saynt Paule that a man shulde loue hys wyfe, as Christ loueth holye churche, that loued it so well that he dyed for it: so shulde a man for hys wyfe, yf it were nede.</P>
<P>Nowe howe that a woman shulde be subiecte to her husbande: that telleth saynte Peter, fyrst in obedience. And also as sayth the decree: A womā that is a wyfe, as long as she is a wyfe she hath none auctoritye to swere ne beare witnes without leaue of her husbande y<SUP>t</SUP> is her Lorde, alwaye he shulde be so by reason. She shulde also serue hym in al honestye &amp; be attēpperate of her array.</P>
<P>I woll well that they shulde set her en¦tent to please her husbādes but not be quein¦tise of her araye. S. Ierom sayeth: wiues y<SUP>t</SUP> be apparelled in sylke and precious purple, ne mowe nat clothe hem in Iesu Christe. Saynt Greg. sayeth also: that no wyghte seketh precious aray, but only for vaynglo∣ry to be honoured the more of the people. It is great foly a woman to haue great araye, outwarde, and in her selfe be foule inwarde A wyfe shulde also be mesurable in lokynge in bearyng, and in laughing, and discrete in al her wordes and her dedes, and aboue all worldelye thynges she shulde loue her hus∣bande wyth al her herte, and to hym be true of her bodye: So shulde an husbande be to hys wyfe: For sythe that all the body is the husbandes, so shuld her hert be, or els there is betwixte hem two, as in that no perfyte mariage. Than shall men vnderstande that for thre thynges a man and hys wyfe flesh∣ly may assemble. The first is for thentent of engendrure of chyldren to the seruice of god for certes that is the cause finall of matri∣mony. Another cause is to yelde ech of hem to other y<SUP>e</SUP> dettes of her bodyes, for neyther of hem hath power of ther owne bodyes. The thyrde is to eschew lechery and vylla∣nye. The fourthe is forsoth deedlye synne. As to the fyrste is meritorye: the seconde al∣so, for as sayeth the decre, that she hath me∣ryte of chastite that yeldeth to her husbande the dette of her body, yee thought it be ayenst her lykynge and the luste of her herte. The thyrde maner is venyall synne, and truelye scarscely may anye of these be wythout ve∣nyal synne for the corruption and for the de∣lyte. The fourth maner is for to vnderstand if they assemble only for amorous loue, and for none of the forsayde causes, but for to ac¦complyshe the brennynge delyte, they recke not howe ofte, sothlye it is deedly sinne: and y<SUP>t</SUP> wyth sorowe some folke woll payne hem more to do then to her appetyte suffiseth.</P>
<P>The seconde maner of chastitye is for to be a clene wydowe and eschew the enbra¦synges of a man, and desyre the enbrasynge of Iesu Christe: These bene those that haue bene wyues, and haue forgote her husban∣des, and also women that haue done leche∣rye, and bene receyued by penitence. And cer¦tes yf that a wyfe coulde kepe her all chaste by licence of her husbande, so that she yeue neuer none occasion that he offende, it were to her a greate meryte. Thys maner of wo∣man that obserueth chastitie in clothynge &amp; in countenaunce, abstinent in eatinge &amp; drin¦kyng, in spekyng and in dede, she is the ves∣sel or the boxe of the blessed Maudelayne y<SUP>e</SUP> fulfylleth holy church of good ordour. The thyrde maner of chastitie is virginitie, and it behoueth that she be holye in herte, &amp; clene of body, than is she spouse of Iesu Christe, and she is the life of aungels: she is the pray synge of thys worlde, &amp; she is as these mar∣tyrs in regaly: she hath in her y<SUP>t</SUP> tonge maye not tell ne herte thynke. Virginitie bare our Lorde Iesu Christe, and virgyn was hym selfe.</P>
<P>Another remedy ayenst lechery is speci∣allye
<PB REF="129"/>
to withdrawe suche thynges as yeue occasyon to that vylanye: as ease, eatynge, and drinkyng: For certes whan the potte bo¦ylleth stronglye, the best remedy is to wyth draw the fyre. Slepyng longe in great qui∣ete is also a great nouryce to lecherye.</P>
<P>Another remedy ayenst lechery is that a man or a woman eschew the company of hem by whiche he douteth to be tēpted: For all be it so that the dede is withstande, yet is there great temptation. Sothly a whyte walle, all thoughe it ne brenne not fullye by stickyng of the candell, yet is the wal blacke of the flame.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Owe for asmuche as the seconde parte of penitence stont in confes∣sion of mouth, as I be gan in the fyrste chap, I saye saynte Austen sayeth.</P>
<P>Sinne is euery worde and euery dede and all that men coniecte agaynst the lawe of Iesu Christe, and thys is for to synne in hert, in mouth, and in dede, by the fyne wyt∣tes, which ben syght, hearyng, smellyng, ta∣styng or sauour, &amp; felynge. Nowe it is good to vnderstande, that that agredgeth muche euery sinne. Thou shalt consider what thou art that doste the syn, whether thou be male or female, yonge or olde, gentyll or thrall, free or seruaunt, hole or sicke, wedded or sin∣gle, ordred or vnordred, wyse or fole, clerke or seculer, yf she be of thy kynrede bodilye or gostly, or no, yf any of thy kynred haue syn∣ned wyth her or no, &amp; many mo thynges. A∣nother circumstaunce is this, whether it be done in fornicacion or in aduoutry or no, in maner of homiced or no, horrible great syn∣nes or smal, &amp; how long thou hast cōtinued in synne. The thyrde circumstaunce is the place there thou hast done synne, wheder in other mennes houses or in thyne owne, in felde, in church or in churchyarde, in church dedecate or no. For yf the churche be halo∣wed &amp; man or woman spyl his kinde, with∣in that place by way of sinne or wicked tēp∣tation, the churche is enterdited, &amp; the preest that dyd such a villany, the terme of all hys life he shulde no more synge masse, and if he did, he shulde do deedly synne at euery tyme y<SUP>t</SUP> he so songe masse. The fourth circūstaūce is by which mediatours or by which messē¦gers, or for enticement, or for cōsentment to beare cōpany with felowshyp. For manye a wretche for to beare cōpanye, wol go to the dyuel of heel: wherfore they that egge or cō∣sent to the sinne, ben parteners of the sinne, &amp; of the temptation of the synner. The fyfth circumstaunce is howe many times that he hath synned, if it be in his minde, &amp; how oft he hath fallen. For he that oft falleth in syn, he dispiceth the mercy of God and encreseth his sinne, &amp; is vnkynde to Christ, &amp; he we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦eth the more feble to withstande syn, a syn¦neth the more lyghtly &amp; the later ryseth, &amp; is more slow to shriue him; &amp; namely to him y<SUP>t</SUP> is his cōfessour. For whiche that folke whā they fal ayen to her olde folyes, eyther they leaue theyr olde cōfessour, or els they depart her shrift in diuers partes. But sothly suche departed shrifte deserueth no mercy of God for her synnes. The sixte circumstaunce is, why that a man sinneth as by temptation: &amp; if him selfe procure that temptation, or by the excitinge of other folke, or if he syn wyth a woman by force or by her assente, or yf the woman maugre her heede haue be a forced or none. This shall she tell, whether it were for couetise or pouertye, or yf it were by her procurement or no, and such other thinges. The seuenth circumstaunce is, in what ma¦ner he hathe do hys synne, or howe that she hathe suffred that folke haue do to her. And the same shall the man tell playnly wyth all the circumstaunces, and whether he hathe synned wyth cōmen bordel woman or none or done hys synne in holye tymes or none, in fasting time or none, or before hys shrifte or after hys later shryfte, and hath parauen¦ture broke therby his penaunce enioyned by whose helpe or whose counsayle, by soce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e

or crafte, all muste be tolde, &amp; all these thyn∣ges after as they be gret or smale, &amp; grudge the conscience of man or womā. And eke the preest that is thy iuge, maye the better be a∣uysed of his iugement in yeuyng of penaūce and that is after thy contrition. For vnder∣stande wel that after tyme that a man hath defoyled hys baptyme by synne, yf he woll come to saluation there is none other waye but by penaunce, shryfte, and satisfaction, &amp; namely by the two, yf there be a confessoure to whom he may shriue him, and the thyrde yf he haue lyfe to perfourme it. Than shall a man loke and consider, that yf he wol make a trewe &amp; a profitable confession, there must be foure conditions.</P>
<P>Fyrst it must be in sorowfulnesse of hert as sayth the kynge Ezechiel to God, I wol remēbre me al the yeres of my lyfe in bitter∣nesse of my hert. This cōdition of bytternes hath fyue signes: The fyrst is that confessi∣on muste be shamefaste, not for to couer ne hide her sin for he hath offēded his lord god &amp; defoyled his soule. And herof sayth saynte Augustyn: The herte traueyleth for shame of his sinne, &amp; for he hath greate shamefast∣nes he is worthy to haue gret mercy of god which was the cōfession of the Publicaue, that wolde not heaue vp hys eyen to heuen for he had offended god of heuen, for which shamfastnesse he had anone y<SUP>e</SUP> mercy of god. And therof sayeth saynt Augustyn: y<SUP>t</SUP> suche shameful folke be next foryeuenesse &amp; mercy.</P>
<P>Another signe is humilite in cōfession, of which sayth saynt Peter▪ Humbleth you vnder the might of god: y<SUP>e</SUP> hande of God is strong in cōfession, for therby god foryeueth the thy sinnes, for he alone hath the power And this humilite shalbe in hert, and in out¦warde signes: For righte as he hath humi∣litie to God in his herte, ryghte so shulde he humble his bodye outwarde to the preest, y<SUP>t</SUP> sytteth in goddes stede. For which in no ma¦ner, syth that Christe is souerayne, and the Preeste meane and mediatoure betwixte Christe, and the synner is laste by waye of reason. Than shulde nat the synner sytte as hye as his cōfessour but knele before him or at his fete, but yf syckenesse cause it: For he shal not take hede who sytteth there, but in whose place he sytteth. A man that hath trespassed to a Lorde &amp; cometh to aske mer∣cye and make hys accorde, and sytteth hym downe by hym, men wolde holde hym out∣ragious and nat worthy so sone for to haue remission of hys trespace.</P>
<P>The thyrde signe is, howe thy shryfte shulde be full of teares yf thou maye, and yf thou maye nat wepe wyth thy bodily eyen, than wepe in thyne herte, whyche was the confession of saynte Peter. For after that he had forsake Iesu Christe, he wente out and wepte full bitterly.</P>
<P>The fourth signe is, that thou ne lette nat for shame to shewe thy cōfession: Such was the confession of Magdaleyn, that ne spared for no shame of hem that were at the feest, to go to oure Lorde Iesu Christe, and beknowe to hym her synnes. The fyfth signe is, that a man or a woman be obey∣saunte to receyue the penaunce that hem is enioyned. For certes Iesu Christe, for the offences of man was obedient to deth. The seconde condition of very confession is, that it be hastely done. For certes, yf a man had a deedly wounde, euer the lenger that he ta∣ryeth to heale hym selfe, the more wolde it corrupte and haste hym to hys deathe, and also the wounde wolde be the worse for to heale. And ryghte so fare the synne, that longe tyme is in a man vnshewed. Certes a man ought hastelye shewe hys synnes for manye causes, as for drede of deathe, that commeth ofte sodaynlye, and no certayne what tyme it shall be, ne in what place, and also the drenchyng of o synne draweth in a∣nother: and also the lenger that he taryeth the farther he is fro Christe. And if he abide to hys last day, scarscely may he shriue hym or remembre hym of hys synnes, or repente for the greuous maladye of hys death. And for as muche as he ne hathe in hys lyfe her∣kened Iesu Christe whan he hath spoken, he shall crye to Iesu Christe at hys last day and scarscely woll he herken hym. And vn∣derstande that thys condition muste haue foure thynges.</P>
<P>Thy shryfte must be prouided before &amp; auysed, for wycked hast doth no profyte, yf a mā shriue him of hys synnes, be it of pride or enuye, and so forthe wyth the speces and circumstaunces of synne. And that he haue cōprehended in hys mynde the nombre and greatnesse of hys synnes, and howe longe
<PB REF="130"/>
he hathe lyen in syn. And also that he hathe be contrite for hys synnes, and in stedfaste purpose (by the grace of God) neuer ayen to fal to synne. And also that he drede &amp; coun∣terwayte hym selfe that he flye the occasion of synne, to whych he is enclined. Also thou shalt shryue the of al thy synnes to a man, &amp; not part to o man and part to another, that is to vnderstande, in entent to depart thy cō¦fession for shame or drede, for it is but stran∣glynge of thy soule. For certes Iesu Christe is entierly al good, in hym nys none imper∣fection, and therfore eyther he foryeueth all perfeitely, or els neuer a deale. I saye nat y<SUP>t</SUP> yf thou be assigned to thy penytencer for cer∣tayne synne that thou arte bounde to shewe hym all y<SUP>e</SUP> remenant of thy synnes, of which thou haste bē shryuen of thy curate, but yf it lyke to the of thy humilite, thys is no parte of thy shrift. Ne I say nat there as I speke of diuision of cōfession, that yf thou haue li∣cence to shryue the to a discrete &amp; an honeste preeste where the lyketh, &amp; by lycence of thy curate, that thou ne mayest well shryue the to him of al thy synnes. Let no synne be vn∣tolde as farre as thou hast remembraunce. And whan thou shalt be shryuen to thy cu∣rate, tell hym all thy synnes that thou haste do syth thou wast laste shriuen. Thys is no wycked entent of diuision of shrift.</P>
<P>Also the very shrift asketh certayne cō∣dicions. Fyrst that thou shriue the by thy fre wyl, nat constrayned for shame of folke, sic∣kenesse, ne such other thynges. For it is rea∣son, that he that trespaceth by his free wyll that by his free wyl he confesse his trespace and that none other man tell hys synne but him selfe, ne he shal nat nay ne deny his sin, ne wrath him ayenst the preest for amonys∣shyng him to leaue hys synne. The seconde condition is, that thy shryfte be laufull, that is to say, that thou shriuest the. And also the preest that hereth thy confession be veryly in fayth of holy churche, and that a man ne be not dispeyred of the mercy of Iesu Christe, as Caym or Iudas. And also a man muste accuse him self of his owne trespace &amp; not a¦nother, but he shall blame &amp; wyte hym selfe and his owne malice of his synne, and none other: But nathelesse if that another man be occasion or entycer of hys syn, or the estate of a person be such by which his synne is a∣gredged, or els y<SUP>t</SUP> he may not playnly shryue him but he tel the personne wyth whiche he hath synned, than may he tell, so that his en¦tent ne be not to backbyte the person, but on¦ly to declare hys confession. Thou ne shalte not also make no leasynges in thy confessiō for humilitie, parauenture to say that thou hast commised and done suche synnes as of whyche that thou ne were neuer gyltye. For saint Augustyn sayeth, yf that thou bicause of thyne humilitye makest leasynges of thy selfe, though thou were not in sinne before, yet arte thou than in synne through thy lea∣synge. Thou muste also shewe thy synne by thyne owne proper mouthe, but thou be dombe &amp; not by no letter▪ For thou that hast done the synne, shalte haue the shame ther∣fore. Thou shalt not eke paynt thy cōfession by fayre subtell wordes, to couer the more thy synne: for than begylest thou thy selfe &amp; nat the preest, thou muste tell it playne, be it neuer so foule ne horrible. Thou shalte also shryue the to a preest, that is discrete to coū∣sayle the, and also thou shalte nat shriue the for vaynglorye, ne for ypocrisye, ne for no cause but only for the loue and feare of Iesu Christ, and heale of thy soule. Thou shalte not also ren to the preest sodainly to tel him lightly thy sinne, as who sayth, to tel a tape or a tale, but auysedly and with good deuo∣tion: And generally shryue the ofte yf thou ofte fal ofte aryse by confession. And though thou shriue the ofter than ones of the synne which thou hast be shriuen of, it is the more merite. And as sayth saynt Augustyn, thou shalt haue the more lyghtly foryeuenes and grace of God, both of sinne and payne. And certes ones a yere at leest, it is laufull to be houseled, for surely ones a yere all thynges renouellen.</P>
<P>Nowe haue I tolde you of very cōfes∣sion, that is the seconde parte of penitence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>¶Explicit secunda pars penitentie: Et sequitur tertia pars.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He thyrde part of penitence is satisfaction, &amp; that stant moste generallye in almesse dedes &amp; bodily payne. Now ben there thre maner of almes. Cōtritiō of hert, where a mā offreth him self to god.</P>
<P><PB N="cxviii" REF="130"/>An other is, to haue pytie of default of his neyghbour. And the thyrde is in gyuyng of good counsayle, goostly and bodily wheras men haue nede, and namely in sustenance of mans fode. And take kepe y<SUP>t</SUP> a mā hath nede of these thynges generallye, he hath nede of fode of clothing, &amp; of herbrow: He hath nede of charitable counsayle, visityng in prison in sickenesse, and sepulture of his body. And if thou mayst nat visite the nedeful in thy per∣sone, visite them with thy message &amp; yeftes. These been generally the almesse &amp; workes of charite, of hem that haue temporal riches or discretion in counsaylyng. Of these wor∣kes shalte thou here at the daye of dome. These almesses shalt thou do of thyn owne proper thynges, &amp; hastesy &amp; priuely if thou mayst: But nathelesse, if thou mayst nat do it priuely, thou shalte nat forbeare to do al∣messe though mē se it, so that it be nat do for thanke of the worlde, but only for thanke of Iesu christ. For as witnesseth saynt Mathu Cap. v. A cyte maye nat be hydde that is set on a mountayne, ne men lyght nat a lantern to putte it vnder abusshel but sette it vpon a candelsticke to yeue light to men in y<SUP>e</SUP> house.</P>
<P>Right so shul your lyght, light before men that they maye se your good workes, &amp; glo∣rify our father that is in heuen.</P>
<P>Now as to speake of bodely payne, it stont in prayers, wakyng, fastyng, vertuous tea∣chyng of orisons. And ye shal vnderstonde, that orisons or prayers is to saye a pitious wyll of herte, that setteth it in God, and ex∣presseth by worde outwarde to remeue har∣mes, and to haue thynges spiritual and du∣rable, and somtyme temporall thynges. Of which orisons, certes in the oryson of the pa¦ter noster: hath Iesu Chryst enclosed moost thynges. Certes it is priuileged of thre thin¦ges in his dignitie, for whyche it is more digne than anye other prayer, for that Iesu Chryst hym selfe made it, and it is short, for it shuld be lerned y<SUP>t</SUP> more lyghtly, &amp; to holde it the more easye in hert, and helpe hym selfe the ofter with that orison: And for a manne shulde be the lesse werye to saye it, &amp; not ex∣cuse hym to lerne it, it is so shorte and easye: and for it comprehendeth in it selfe all good prayers. The exposition of this holy prayer that is so excellent and digne, I refere to the masters of theology, saue thus moche woll I saye, that whan thou prayest, that God shoulde foryeue the thyne offences, as thou foryeuest them that haue offended the. Be well ware that thou be not oute of charitye. This holy orison aminisheth also venial syn and therfore it appertayneth specyallye to penitence.</P>
<P>This prayer must be truly sayd and in par∣fyte fayth, and that men praye to God ordi∣natly, discretly, and deuoutly, and alwaye a man shall put his wyll to be subiecte to the wyll of God. This oryson muste also be sayd with great humblenesse and full pure &amp; honestlye, and not to the auoyaunce of anye man or woman: It muste also be continued with the workes of charitie. It auayleth al¦so ayenst the vices of the soule: For as saith saynct Ierome: By fastyng ben saued the vi¦ces of the flesshe, and by prayer the vyces of the soule.</P>
<P>After this thou shalt vnderstond, that bo¦dily prayer stont in waking. For Iesu christ sayth: wake ye and praye, that ye ne entre in to wycked temptation. Ye shul vnderstonde also, that fastyng stont in thre thynges: In forberyng of bodily mete and drinke, in for∣bering of wordly iolitie, and in forberynge of deedly syn: this is to say: that a man shall kepe hym fro deedly syn with all his myght</P>
<P>And thou shalt vnderstond also, that god ordayned fastynge, and to fastynge pertay∣neth four thynges. Largenesse to pore folke gladnesse of hert spiritual: not to be angrye ne anoyed, ne grutche for he fasteth and also resonable hour to eat by measure, that is to saye, a man shall not eate in vntyme, ne syt the lenger at the table, for he fasteth.</P>
<P>Than shalt thou vnderstonde, that bodi∣ly payne stont in disciplyne or teachynge by worde or wrytynge, or by example. Also in wearynge of heer or stamyn or of harbergi∣ons on her naked flesshe for Chrystes sake, and that suche maner penaunces, ne make nat thyne hert bytter or angrye, ne anoyed of thy selfe, for better is to cast awaye thyne heere, than to cast away the swetnesse of Ie¦su Chryst. And therfore sayth saynct Poule: Clothe you, as they that ben chosen of God in hert of misericorde, debonartie, suffraūce and suche maner of clothyng, of which Ie∣su Chryste is more pleased, than with hee∣res or habergions.</P>
<P><PB REF="131"/>Than is disciplyne also, in knockynge of thy brest, in scourgyng with roddes, in kne∣lyng, in tribulation, in suffrynge pacientlye wronges that ben do to the, &amp; also in paciēt suffrynge of sycknesse, or lesyng of worldlye goodes or cattel, or wyfe, chylde, or other frendes.</P>
<P>Than shalt thou vnderstande which thin¦ges distourbe penaunce, and that is in foure maners, drede, shame, hope, and wanhope, that is desperation: And for to speake fyrste of drede for whiche he weneth that he maye suffre no penaunce. There ayenst is remedy for to thynke that bodilye penaunce is but shorte and lytle, at regarde of the payne of hell that is so cruell and so longe, that it la∣steth without ende.</P>
<P>Nowe ayenst the shame that a man hath to shryue hym, and namely these ypocrytes that wold be hold so perfyte, that they haue no nede to shryue hem. Ayenste that shame shulde a man thynke that by way of reason, that he that hath not be ashamed to do foul thynges: certes hym ought not be ashamed for to do fayre thynges, and that is cōfessy∣ons. A man shuld also thinke that god seeth and knoweth all his thoughtes and all hys werkes: To hym may nothyng be hyd ne co¦uered. Men shoulde also remembre hem of the shame that is to com at the day of dome to hem that ben not penitent and shryuen in this present lyfe. For all the creatures in erth and in hell shall se apertly, all that they hydde in this present worlde. Nowe for to speake of the hope of hem that bene so negli∣gent and slow to shryue them: that stondeth in two maners. That one is, that he hopeth for to lyue longe, and for to purchace moche rychesse for his delyte, and thā he wol shriue hym: And as he sayeth, hym semeth than tymely ynough to come to shryft.</P>
<P>An other is of surquidrie that he hath in christes mercy. Ayenst the fyrst vyce he shal thynke that our lyfe is in no sykerneke, and also that all the rychesses in this world ben in aduenture, and passe as a shadowe on the wall: And as sayth saynct Gregorye, that it appertayneth to the great ryghteousnesse of god, that neuer shal the payne stynte of hem that neuer wold withdrawe hem fro synne her thankes, but euer continued in synne: for that perpetuall wyll to do synne, shall they haue perpetuall payne. wanhope is in two maners. The fyrst wanhope is in the mercy of god. That other is that they thynke that they ne myght not longe perseuer in good∣nesse. The fyrste wanhope commeth of that he demeth that he hath synned so greatlye &amp; so oft and so longe lyen in synne, that he shal not be saued. Certes agaynst that cursed wā¦hope shuld he thynke that the passion of Ie∣su Chryste is more stronge for to vnbynde, than synne is stronge for to bynde. Ayenste the seconde wanhope he shal thynke that as often as he falleth he maye ryse agayne by penitence: and though he neuer so long hath lyen in synne, the mercy of Chryst is alway redy to receyue hym to mercye. Ayenste the wanhope that he deemeth, he shoulde not longe perseuer in goodnesse, he shall thynke, that the feblenesse of the deuyl may nothyng do but yf men woll suffre hym, and also he shall haue strēgth of the helpe of Iesu christ and of all holye churche, and the protection of angels yf hym lyst.</P>
<P>Than shal men vnderstande what is the fruyte of penaunce, and after the wordes of Iesu Chryst, it is endlesse blesse of heauen. There ioye hath neuer ende, no contrariety of wo ne greuaunce: ther al harmes ben pas¦sed of this presēt lyfe, there as is y<SUP>e</SUP> sykernes fro the payne of hell, there as is the blysfull company that reioyse hem euermo, eueriche of others ioye: ther as the body of man, that somtyme was foule and dark, is more clere than the sunne: there as the body that som∣tyme was sycke, freyle, and feble, and mor∣tall, is immortall, and so stronge and hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that there ne maye nothyng appeyre it: ther as is neyther hungre, thurst ne colde, but eue¦ry soule replenysshed with the syght of the perfyte knowynge of God. This blysfull reygne may men purchace by pouertie espi∣rituel, and the glory by lownesse, the plentie of ioye by hungre and thurst, and the rest by trauayle, and the lyf by deth and mortifica∣tion of syn: to whiche lyfe he vs bryng that bought vs with his pecious bloude.

<LG>
<L>But it were rather an opinion</L>
<L>Vncertayne, and no stedfast foreseyng</L>

<L>Eke thys is an opinion of some</L>
<L>That haue her top ful hygh &amp; smoth yshore</L>

<L>And in thys maner thys necessyte</L>

<L>The certayne cause of the necessite</L>

<L>Or of necessite of thynge comynge</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now ne enforce I me not in shewyng</L>
<L>How y<SUP>e</SUP> ordre of y<SUP>e</SUP> causes stāt, but wel wote I</L>
<L>That it behoueth that the befallyng</L>

<L>That prescience put fallynge necessayre</L>
<L>To thynge to come, all fall it foule or fayre</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For yf there syt a man yonde on a see</L>

<L>That certes thyne opinion soth be</L>

<L>Lo, ryght so is it on the parte contrarye</L>
<L>As thus, nowe herken for I woll not tarye</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I saye that yf the opinion of the</L>
<L>Be soth for that he syt, then saye I thys</L>
<L>That he mote sytten by necessyte</L>
<L>And thus necessyte in eyther is</L>
<L>For in hym nede of syttynge is ywys</L>
<L>And in the nede of soth, and thus forsoth</L>
<L>There mote necessite ben in you both</L>

<L>Therfore is thyne opinion soth ywys</L>

<L>Cometh of hys syttynge, yet necessite</L>
<L>Is entrechaunged, both in hem and in the</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus in the same wyse out of dontaunce</L>
<L>I maye well maken, as it semeth me</L>

<L>For al though that forthing shal come ywys</L>
<L>Therfore is it purueyd certaynly</L>

<L>Or els thinges that purueyed be</L>
<L>That they betyden by necessyte</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And this suffyseth ryght ynough certayne</L>
<L>For to destroye our free choyce euerydel</L>
<L>But nowe is thys abusyon to sayne</L>
<L>That fallynge of the thynges temporel</L>
<L>Is cause of the goddes prescience eternell</L>
<L>Nowe truely that is a false sentence</L>
<L>That thing to come shuld cause his presciēce</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>what might I wene &amp; I had such a thought</L>
<L>But that god purueyeth thynge y<SUP>t</SUP> is to come</L>
<L>For that it is to come, and els nought</L>
<L>So might I wene that thinges al and some</L>
<L>That whylom ben byfal and ouercome</L>
<L>Ben cause of thylke souerayne purueyaunce</L>

<P>This is open and clere ({quod} she) that all other thynges ben referred and brought to good.

And this same thynge mowen we thynken and coniecten of reue∣rence, of noblesse and of delyte. Than is soue¦rayne good, the summe and the cause of all that ought to ben desyred. For why, thylke thyng that withholdeth no good in it sell, ne semblaunce of good, it ne maye nor well in no maner be desyred ne requyred. And con¦trarye: For though that thynges by her na∣ture ne ben not good, algates yf men wenen that they ben good, yet ben they desyred as though they were verelye good. And there∣fore it is sayde, that men ought to wene by ryght, that bountie bene the souerayne fyne and the cause of all the thynges that bene to requyren. But certes, thilke that is cause for which mē requiren any thing, it semeth that thilke same thyng be most desyred, as thus: Yf that a wyghte wolde ryden for cause of heale, he ne desyreth not so moch y<SUP>e</SUP> mouinge to ryden as the effecte of his heale.

<P><PB N="ccl" REF="262"/>But we haue graunted that blysfulnesse is that same thynge, for whyche that all these other thynges bene desyred.

<SPEAKER>Philosophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou rennest aryght beforne me, quod she, and thys is the iudge∣mente, that is to sayne, I iuge of ryghte, as these leches bene wonte to hopen of sycke folke, when they apperceyuen, that nature is redressed and wythstandeth to the maladye. But for I se the nowe all redy to the wyth∣standynge, I shal shewe the more thylke and continuell reasons. For loke howe greatlye sheweth the feblenesse and infyrmite of wyc∣ked folke, that ne mowen not comen to that her naturell entencion leadeth hem: And yet almoste thylke naturell entencion constray∣neth hem. And what were to demen then of shrewes, yf thylke naturell helpe had forlettē hem, the whyche naturell helpe of entencion goeth alwaye beforne hem, and is so greate, that vnneth it maye be ouercomen? Consy∣der then howe great defaute of power, and howe greate feblesse there is in wycked felo¦nous folke, as who sayeth, y<SUP>e</SUP> greater thynge that is coueyted, and the desyre not accomply¦shed, of the lasse myght is he that coueyteth it, and maye not accomplyshe. And for thy philosophie sayeth thus by souerayne good: Ne shrewes ne requyren not lyght medes ne vayne games, whych they ne maye not folo∣wen ne holdē, but they faylen of thylke sūme of the heyght of thynges, that is to sayne, so∣uerayne good. Ne these wretches ne comen not to theffecte of souerayne good, the which they enforcen hem onely to getten by nygh∣tes and by dayes, in gettynge of whych good the strēgth of good folke is ful wel ysent. For ryght as thou myghtest demen hym myghty of goynge, y<SUP>t</SUP> goeth on hys fete tyll he myght comen to thylke place, fro the whyche place there ne laye no waye further to be gone: ryghte so muste thou nedes demen hym for ryght myghty, whych that getteth and attay¦neth to the ende of all thynges, whyche that bene to desyren, beyonde the whyche ende there nys nothynge to desyre. Of the whych power of good folke men maye cōclude, that we wycked men semen to be barayne and na∣ked of all strength. For why forletten they vertues &amp; folowen vyces, nys it not for that they ne knowen not the goodes? But what thynge is more feble and more caytyfe, then is the blyndnesse of ignoraunce? or els they knowē wel whych thynges they oughtē folo¦wen, but lechery and couetyse ouerthroweth hem mysturned. And certes so dothe dystem∣peraunce to feble men, that mowe not wrast len ayen these vices. Ne knowe they not wel that they forletten the good wylfullye, and tournen hem wylfully to vyces. And in thys wyse they ne forletē not onely to be myghty, but they forleten al vtterly in any wyse for to
<PB REF="267"/>
ben. For they that forletē the comune fyne of all thynges that ben, they forleten also ther∣wythall for to ben. And perauenture it shuld semen to some folke, that thys were a mar∣uayle to sayne, that shrewes, whych that con¦teynen the more partes of men, ne bene not, ne haue no beynge. But natheles it is so, and thus stante thys thinge. For they that be shre¦wes, I denye not, but that they be shrewes, but I denye symply and playnly that they ne be not, ne haue no beynge. For ryght as thou myghtest fayne of the carayne of a man, that it were a deed man: so graunt I wel forsoth that vicious folke ben wycked, but I ne may not absolutely and symplye graunt that they ben. For thylke thynge that with holdeth or∣dre and kepeth nature, thylke thynge is and hath beynge. But what thynge fayleth that, that is to saye, he that forleteth naturel order he forleteth thylke beynge that is set in hys nature? But thou wolt sayne, y<SUP>t</SUP> shrewes mo∣wen. Certes that ne denye I not: but certes her power ne dyscendeth not of strength, but of feblenesse, for they mowen done wycked∣nesse, the whyche they ne myght not, yf they myghten dwellen in the forme and in the do∣ynge of good people. And thylke power she∣weth euydently, y<SUP>t</SUP> they mowē ryght naught For so as I haue gadred and proued a lytell here beforn, that euyll is not, and so as shre∣wes may only but shreudnesse. Thys conclu∣syon is al clere, that shrewes ne mowe ryght naught, ne haue no power. And for as moch as thou vnderstandest whych is the strength of this power, I haue defynyshed a lytel here beforne, that no thynge nys so myghty as so¦uerayne good.</P>

And syth it is thus, that good mē ne faylen neuer more of her mede, certes no mā ne may doute of the vndepartable payne of shrewes, that is to sayne, y<SUP>t</SUP> the payne of shre∣wes departeth not from hem selfe neuer mo. For so as good and euell, and payne &amp; medes be contrarye, it mote nedes be, that ryght as we se betyden in guerdone of good, that also mote the payne of the yuel answere by the cō¦trarye partyes to shrewes.

And also loke on shrewes, that ben the contrarye partye of good men, howe great payne feloushyppeth and fouleth hem: for thou hast lerned a lytel here beforne, that all thynge that is and hath beynge, is one, and thylke same one is good: then is thys y<SUP>e</SUP> consequence, y<SUP>t</SUP> it semeth well, that all thynge y<SUP>t</SUP> is &amp; hath beynge, is good, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to sayne, as who sayeth, that beyng, vnite &amp; goodnesse is al one.

But thylke other forme of mākinde, that is to sayne, y<SUP>t</SUP> fourme of the body wythout, sheweth that these shre¦wes weren whylom men, wherfore when they bene peruerted and tourned into ma∣lyce, certes thē they haue forlorne the nature of mankynde: But so as only bountye &amp; pro∣wesse maye enhaūsen euery man, ouer men: then mote it nedes be that shrewes, whyche

Then betydeth it, that yf thou seest a wyghte whyche that is transfourmed into vyces, thou mayest not wene that he be a man: For yf he be ar∣daunt in auaryce, and that he be a rauenour by vyolence of forayne rychesse, thou shalte sayne that he is lyke a wolfe.

<P>Tho spake she ryght as by another begynnyng, and sayd right thus. The engendryng of all thynges ({quod} she) and all the progressyons of mouable nature, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that moueth in any maner, taketh his cau∣ses hys ordre and hys fourmes, of the stable∣nesse of diuyne thought: And thylke diuyne thought that is set and put in the toure, that is to sayne, in the heyght of the symplicyte of god, stablysheth manye maner gises to the thynges that ben to done, the whyche maner whan that men loken it, in the pure clennesse of the dyuyne intellygence, is cleaped pur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yaunce. But whan thylke maner is refer∣red by men, to thynges that it moueth or disponeth, than of olde men it was cleaped destenye, the whyche thynges, yf that anye might loketh wel in hys thouʒt, the strength of that one and of that other, he shall lyght∣ly mowe sene, that these two thynges ben di∣uers. For pourueyaunce is thylke dyuyne reason, that is establyshed in the souerayne prynce of thynges, the whych pourueyaunce dysponeth all thynges. But certes destynye is the disposycyon and the ordynaunce cle∣uynge to mouable thynges, by the whyche disposycyon the pourueyaunce knytteth all thynges in her ordre: For pourueyaunce en∣braseth all thynges to heape, all though they be dyuers, and all though they be infynite, but destenye certayne departeth and orday∣neth all thinges syngulerly, and deuydeth in mouyng, in places, in formes, and in tymes, as thus: Let the vnfoldynge of temporall or dynaunce assembled and oned in the lokynge of the diuyne thought be cleaped purueyaūce and thylke same assemblynge and onynge de¦uyded and vnfolden, lette that be called deste∣nye. And al be it so that these thynges ben di∣uers, yet neuerthelesse hanged that one on that other, for why, the ordre destynable pro∣cedeth of the symplycyte of pourueyaunce. For ryght as a werkeman perceyueth in hys thought, the forme of a thynge that he woll make, and moueth the effecte of the werke, and leadeth that he had loked beforne in his thought symply and presently by corporal or dynaunce: certes ryght so god in his puruey∣aunce dysponeth syngulerlye and stably, the thynges that be to done, but he admynistreth in maners and in dyuers tymes by destenye, thylke same thynges that he hath disponed, than whether destenye be exercised eyther by some diuyne spirytes, seruauntes to the dy∣uyne pourueyaunce, or els by some soule, or els by all nature seruyng to god, or els by the celestyall mouynges of sterres, or els by the vertue of aungels, or els by dyuers subtyltie of dyuels, or els by any of hem, or els by hem all, the destynable ordynaunce is wouen and accomplyshed. Certes it is open thyng that the pourueyaunce is an vnmonable and sym¦ple fourme of thynges to doone, and the mo∣uable bonde and the temporall ordynaunce of thynges, whych that the diuyne symplicite of pourueyaunce hath ordayned to done, that is destenye. For whiche it is that all thynges that ben put vnder destenye, ben certes subie∣ctes vnto pourueyaunce, to whiche pouruey∣aunce destenye it selfe is subiecte and vnder, but some thinges ben put vnder purueyaūce, that surmounten the ordynaunce of desteny:
<PB REF="271"/>
And tho ben thylke that stablye ben fyxed nyghe to the fyrst godheed, they surmounten the ordre of destinable mouablyte. For ryght as cercles turnen aboute a same centre or a∣boute a poynte, thylke cercle that is innerest or moste within, he ioyneth to y<SUP>e</SUP> symplesse of y<SUP>e</SUP> myddle, &amp; is as it were a centre or a poynte to that other cercles, that tournē about him: and thilke that is vtterest, compassed by a lar¦ger enuyronnynge, is vnfolde by larger spa∣ces, in somoche as it is fertherest fro the myd¦delest symplycite of the poynte. And yf there be any thing that knytteth and feloushippeth him selfe to thylke myddle poynte, it is con∣strayned in to symplycite, that is to saye, in to vnmouablite, and it ceaseth to ben shadde &amp; flytte dyuersly. Right so by semblable reason thylke thynge that departeth furtherest fro the fyrste thought of god, it is vnfolden and also submytted to greater bondes of destyne, and in so moche is the thynge more free and loce fro dignyte, as it asketh &amp; holdeth nerre to thylke centre of thynges, that is to sayne, to god. And yf the thyng cleaueth to the sted∣fastnesse of the thought of god, and be wyth∣out mouynge, certes it surmounteth the ne∣cessyte of destenye. Than suche comparyson as is skyllynge to vnderstandynge, and of thynge that was engendred to thyng that is of tyme to eternyte, and of the cercle to the cē∣tre, ryght so is the ordre of mouable destyne, to the stable symplycite of pourueyaunce. Thylke ordynaunce moueth the heuen and the sterres, and attempreth the elementes to∣gyder amonge hem selfe, and transformeth hem by entrechaungeable mutacyon. And thylke same ordre neweth ayen all thynges growyng and fallyng adowne, by semblable progressyons of sedes and of sexus, that is to sayne, male and female: and thys ylke ordre constrayneth the fortunes and the dedes of men by a bonde of causes, not able to be vn∣bounden: the whiche destinable causes whan they passen out fro the begynnynges of vn∣mouable purueyaunce, it mote nedes be that they ne be not mutable, as thus: Be the thyn∣ges wel gouerned, yf that y<SUP>e</SUP> symplicite dwel∣ling in the diuyne thought, sheweth forth the ordre of causes vnable to be bowed. And this ordre constrayneth by the propre stabylite the mouable thynges, or els they shulden flete fo¦lily. For whiche it is, that thynges semen con¦fuse and troublye to vs men, for we ne mo∣wen not consyder thylke ordynaunce. Neuer¦theles, the propre maner of euery thing, dres∣syng him to good disponeth hem all, for there nys nothyng done for yuell, for thylke thyng that is done by wycked folke, nys not don for yuel.

but for to constrayne, as who sayeth, but for to comprehende and tel a fewe thyn∣ges of the dyuine depenesse, the whych that mannes reason maye vnderstande. Thylke man that thou wenest to bene ryght iuste &amp; ryght kepyng of equite, the contrary of that semeth to the dyuine purueyaunce that all wote. And Lucan my familyer telleth, that the victorious cause lyked to the gods, &amp; the causes ouercome lyketh to Caton. Thanne what so euer thou maist sene that is done in this worlde vnhoped or els vnknowen, cer∣tes it is the right ordre of thinges, but as to thy wicked opinion, it is a confusion. But I suppose y<SUP>e</SUP> some man be so wel thewed, that the dyuine iugement &amp; the iugemēt of man∣kynde accorden hem togyther of him: but he is so vnstedfast of corage, that if any aduer∣site come to him, he wol forleten perauēture to contynue innocencie, by the whyche he ne may not withholden fortune: than the wyse dispensacion of god spareth hym, the which man aduersite myghte enpayren, for y<SUP>e</SUP> God wyl not hym to trauayle, to whō y<SUP>t</SUP> trauayle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s not couenable. An other man is perfyte in al vertues, and is an holy man &amp; nygh to God, so that the purueyaunce of God wold deme, that it were a felony that he were tou¦ched with anye aduersytees, so that he woll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>re, that suche a man be wyth any bodyly malady moued. But so (as sayd the philoso∣phie y<SUP>t</SUP> more excellent is by me said in great that vertues haue edifyed the body of the ho¦lyman, &amp; ofte tyme it betydeth, that y<SUP>e</SUP> sūme of thynges that bene to done is taken to go∣uerne to good folke, for y<SUP>t</SUP> the malice haboū∣daunt of shrewes shulde bene abated. And god yeueth and departeth to other folke pro¦speritees and aduersitees medled to heape, after the qualyte of her corages, and remor∣dethe some folke by aduersitees, for they ne shulde not waxen proude by longe weleful∣nes.

And other folke dreden more than they oughten, the whyche they myghten wel bearen, and some dispyse that they mowe not beare, and thylke folke God leadeth in to experience of hem selfe by aspre and soroufull thynges. And manye o∣ther folke haue bought honourable renome of this worlde, by the price of gloriouse deth And some men that ne mowe not bene ouer∣comen by tourment haue yeuen ensample to other folke, that vertue maye not bene ouer∣comen by aduersitees. And of all these thyn∣ges there nys no dout, that they ne ben done rightfully and ordaynly, to the parfite good of hem, to whom we sene these thynges be∣tyde. For certes that aduersities cometh sō∣tyme to shrewes, and somtyme that they de¦syren, it cometh of these forsayd causes. And of sorouful thinges that betiden to shrewes certes no mā ne wondreth, for all men wene that they haue deserued it, &amp; that they bene of wicked merite. Of which shrewes the tur∣mente agasteth somtyme other to done felo∣nyes: and somtyme it amendethe hem that suffreth the tourmentes. And the prosperyte that is yeuēto shrewes, sheweth a great ar∣gumente to good peple, what thynge they shulde demen of thylke welfulnesse, whyche prosperite mē sene ofte serue to shrewes: In whyche thinge I trow that God dispenseth for parauenture the nature of some mā is so ouerthrowyng to yuell and so vncouenable, y<SUP>e</SUP> the nedy pouerte, of hys housholde myght rather agreue hym to done felonyes, and to the maladye of hym God putteth remedy to yeuen hym richesse. And some other man be∣holdeth hys cōscience defouled wyth synnes and maketh cōparyson of thys fortune and of hym selfe, and dredethe parauenture that the blysfulnesse, of whyche the vsage is ioy∣full to hym, that the lesynge of thylke blys∣fulnesse ne be not sorowfull to hym, &amp; ther∣fore he wolde chaunge hys maners: and for he dredeth to lese hys fortune, he forletethe hys wyckednesse. To other folkes welful∣nesse is yeuen vnworthylye, the whyche o∣uerthroweth hem in to destructiō that they han deserued, and to some other folke is ye∣uē power to punishē, for that it shal be cause of contynuacyon, and exercysynge to good folkes, and cause of turmēt to shrewes. For so as there nys none aliaunce bitwene good folkes and shrewes, ne shrewes ne mowen not accorden amonge hem selfe: &amp; why not? For y<SUP>t</SUP> shrewes discorden of hem selfe by her vices the which vices al to renden her cōsci∣ences, and done oft tyme the thinges, which thynges whan they haue doone hem, they deme that tho thynges ne shuld not haue be

For whā that some shrewes sene that they suffre wrōgfully felonyes of other shrewes, they waxen eschaufed in to hate of hem that annoyed hem, and retournē to the fruite of vertue. Than they studyen to be vn¦like to hem that they haue hated. Certes one¦ly is thys the dyuyne myght, to the whyche myght yuels bene than good, whan it vseth the yuels couenably, and draweth out the ef¦fecte of any good, as who sayeth, that yuell is good onely to the myghte of God, for the might of god ordeyneth thylke yuel to good For one ordre enbraceth all thynges, so that what wyghte departeth from the reason of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hylke ordre that is assygned to hym, alga∣tes yet he slydeth in to another ordre, so that nothyng is lefull to foly in the realme of dy∣uyne purueyaunce, as who sayeth, nothyng is wythout ordynaunce in the realme of dy∣uyne pourueaunce, syth that the ryght strōg God gouerneth all thynges in thys worlde for it is not leful for men to comprehende by wyt ne vnfolden by worde all the subtyl or∣dynaunce and the dysposycyon of the diuine entent, for only it ought to suffyse to haue lo¦ked that God hym selfe, maker of al natures ordayneth all thynges to good, whyle that he hasteth to wythholde the thinges that he hath maked in to his semblaunce, that is to say, for to wythholden y<SUP>e</SUP> thinges in to good for he him selfe is good.

Ne I ne proue nat thylke same rea¦son, as who sayeth, I ne alowe not, or I ne prayse not thylke same reason, by whiche y<SUP>t</SUP> some men wenen that they mowe assoylen and vnknytten the knotte of this questyon.</P>
<P>For certes they seyn, that thyng nis not to comen, for that the purueyaūce of god hath seen beforne that it is to comen, but rather y<SUP>e</SUP> contrary, and that is this, that for that the thynges is to comen, that therfore ne maye it not ben hyd from the purueyaunce of god And in this maner this necessitie slideth ayē into the contrarye partye, ne it ne behoueth not nedes, that thinges betyden that bene y∣purueyed, but it behoueth nedes, that thyn∣ges that bene to comen ben ypurueyed, but as it were ytrauayled, as who sayth y<SUP>e</SUP> thilk answer procedeth ryght as though men tra¦uayleden or weren busye to enquyren, the which thyng is cause of the which thinges. As whether the prescience is cause of the ne¦cessitie of thynges to comen, or els that y<SUP>e</SUP> ne¦cessitie of thynges to comen, is cause of the purueyaunce. But I ne enforce me not now to shewen it y<SUP>t</SUP> the betyding of thinges ywist beforne is necessary, how so or in what ma∣ner, that the ordre of causes hath it selfe, al∣though that it ne seme not that the presciēce bryng in necessitie of betydynge, to thynges to comen. For certes yf that any wyght syt∣teth, it behoueth by necessitie that the opiniō be soth of him that coniecteth that he sytteth and ayen warde also is it of the cōtrary, for yf the opynyō be soth of any wyght for that he sytteth, it behoueth by necessiitie that he syt. Than is here necessitie in that one and in that other: for in that one is necessitie of syt∣tynge, and certes in that other is necessitye of soth. But therfore ne sytteth not a wyght for that the opynyon of the syttynge is soth but the opynion is rather sothe, for that a wyght sytteth beforne. And thus although that the cause of the sothe cōmeth of that o∣ther syde, as who sayeth, that although the cause of soth commeth of the syttynge, and not of the true opynion, algates yet is there a commune necessitie in that one and in that other. Thus seweth it, that I may make sē∣blable skylles of the purueyaunce of God, &amp; of thynges to comen. For although that for that thynges bene to comen, therfore bene they purueyed, and not certes, for they bene purueyed, therfore ne betyde they not, nathe¦lesse it behoueth by necessitie, that eyther the thynges to comen bene ypurueyed of god or els that the thynges that bene purueyed of god betyden. And this thynges onely suffy∣seth ynough to destroien the fredome of our arbytre, that is to saye, of our fre wyll. But certes nowe sheweth it well howe ferre fro the soth, and how vp sodowne is this thing that we sene that the betydyng of temporal thynges is cause of the eterne prescience.</P>
<P>But for to wenen that God purueyeth the thynges to comen: what other thynge is it but for to wene, that thylke thynges that be¦tyde whylom, ben causes of thylke souerain purueyaunce y<SUP>t</SUP> is in God. And hereto adde I yet this thynges, that ryght as whan y<SUP>t</SUP> I wote that a thyng is, behoueth by necessi¦tie that thylke selfe thyng be, and eke whan I haue knowen that any thyng shal betydē so behoueth it by necessitie that thylke same thynges betyde. So foloweth it than, that the betydyng of the thynges wyst beforne, ne may not be eschued, and at the last, if that any wyght wene a thyng to ben otherwyse than it is, it nys not only vnscience, but it is disceyuable opynyon, full dyuers and farre fro the soth of science. wherfore yf any thing be so to comen, that the betydyng of it ne be not certayne ne necessarye, who may weten beforne that thylke thynge is to comen.

<P><PB REF="276"/>what shall I than sayne, in whiche maner knoweth god beforne al y<SUP>e</SUP> thynges to comē yf they ne be not certayne, for yf y<SUP>t</SUP> he deame that they ben to comen vneschuably, and so maye be that it is possyble, y<SUP>t</SUP> they ne shullen not comen, god is disceyued, but not only to trowen y<SUP>t</SUP> god is disceyued, but for to speake it with mouth, it is a felonous synne.

But the yma∣ginacion comprehendeth onely the figure w<SUP>t</SUP> out the mater. Reason surmounteth ymagi∣nacion, and comprehendeth by vniuersal lo∣kyng the cōmune speche, but the eye of intel∣ligence is hygher, for it surmounteth the en∣uyronyng of the vniuersite, and loketh ouer that, by pure subtiltie of thought. Thylke same symple fourme of man, that is perdu∣rable in the diuine thought, in whiche thys ought greatly to be considred, that the hyest strength for to comprehenden thynges em∣braceth and contayneth the lower strength, but y<SUP>e</SUP> lower strēgth ne aryseth not in no ma¦ner to the hyer strength. For wyt ne may cō∣prehende nothyng out of mater, ne that ima¦ginacyon ne loketh not the vniuersal speces ne reason ne taketh not the symple fourme, so as intelligence taketh it. But intelligence that loketh all abouen, whan it hath com∣prehended the fourme, it knoweth &amp; demeth all the thynges that ben vnder the fourme, but she knoweth hem in thylke maner, in which it comprehendeth thylk same simple forme y<SUP>t</SUP> ne may neuer ben knowē of none of y<SUP>t</SUP> other, that is to say, to non of the thre for∣sayd strengthes of the soule, for it knoweth the vniuersitie of reason, and the fygure of ymaginacion, and the sensyble material cō∣ceyued by wyt, ne it vseth not ne of reason, ne of ymaginacion ne of wyt withoutforth but it beholdeth al thynges, so as I shal say by a stroke of thought fermely without dis∣cours of collacion.

Than thylke thynge that suffreth temporall condycion, al though that it neuer began to be, ne though it neuer cease to be (as Arystoteles demed of the worlde) &amp; although the life of it be stretched
<PB REF="279"/>
wyth infynite of tyme, yet algates nys it no suche thynge, as men might trowen by right that it is eterne. For all thought that it com∣prehende and enbrace the space of the lyfe in∣fynite, yet algates ne embraseth it not y<SUP>e</SUP> space of the lyfe all togyther, for it ne hath not the futures that be not yet: ne it ne hathe no len∣ger the preteritees that bē don or passed. But thylke thyng than, that hath and comprehen∣deth togyder al the plentie of the lyfe intermy¦nable, to whome there ne fayleth naught of the future, and to whom there nys naught of the preterite escaped or passed, thylke same is ywitnessed and proued by right to ben etern.</P>
<P>And it behoueth by necessyte that thylke thynge be alway present to him selfe, and cō∣petent, as who saythe, alway present to hym selfe, and so mighty, that all be ryght at hys pleasaunce, and that he haue all present the infynyte of y<SUP>e</SUP> mouable tyme. Wherfore some men trowen wrongfully, that whan they he∣ren that it semed to Plato, that thys worlde had neuer begynnynge of tyme, that it neuer shall haue faylyng: they wene in thylke ma∣ner, that this worlde be maked eterne, wyth hys maker, as who saith, they wene that this worlde and god be maked togyther eterne. And that is a wrongfull wenynge, for other thyng it is to be ladde by the lyfe intermina∣ble, as Plato graunted to the worlde, and o∣ther thyng it is to embrace togyther, al y<SUP>e</SUP> pre∣sence of the lyfe that is intermynable, which thynge is clere and manyfest to the diuyne thought. Ne it ne shulde not seme to vs that god is elder than thynges that ben maked by quantyte of tyme, but rather by y<SUP>e</SUP> prosperyte of hys symple nature. For thys ylke infynyte mouynges of temporall thynges foloweth this presentary estate of this life immouable &amp; so as it ne may not countrefayten ne fayne it, ne be euenlyke to it for y<SUP>e</SUP> immobilyte, that is to say, that is in the eternyte of god, it fay∣leth &amp; falleth in to mouyng fro the symplicite of the presence of god, &amp; disencreaseth in y<SUP>e</SUP> in∣fynite quantyte of future &amp; preterite. And so as it maye not haue togyther al the plentie of the lyfe, algates yet for as moch as it ceaseth neuer for to ben in some maner, yet it semeth somdele to vs, that it foloweth &amp; resembleth thylke thing, that it ne may not attayne to ne fulfyllen, and byndeth it selfe to some maner presence of this lytel moment, the which pre∣sence of this lytel and swift moment, for that it beareth a maner ymage or lykenesse of the aye dwellyng of god: it graunteth to such ma¦ner thynges, as it betydeth to, that it semeth hem, as these thinges haue ben, and ben. And for that the presence of such lytell moment ne may not dwell, therfore it rauyshed and toke thinfynite way of tyme, that is to say, by suc∣cessyon, and by this maner it is done, for that it shulde cōtinue the lyfe in goyng, of y<SUP>t</SUP> which lyfe it ne myght not enbrace the plentye of dwellyng. And for thy if we wollen put wor¦thy names to thynges that folowen Plato, let vs saye than sothlye, that god is eterne, and that the worlde is perpetuell. Than syth euery iugemēt knoweth and comprehendeth by hys own nature, thynges that ben subiect vnto hym, there is to god alwayes an eterne and a presentarye estate. And the scyence of hym that ouerpasseth all temporall moment, dwelleth in symplycite of hys presence, and enbraseth and consydereth all the infynyte spaces of tymes preterytes, and of tymes fu∣tures, and loketh in hys symple knowyng all thynges of preterite, right as they werē ydon presentlye ryght nowe. If thou wylte than thynken and aduyse the prescyence, by which it knoweth all thynges, thou ne shalt not de¦men it as prescience of thynges to comen but thou shalt demen more ryghtfully that it is scyence of presence or of instaunce that neuer ne fayleth, for whyche it nys not ycleped pre∣uidence, but it shulde rather ben cleaped pur∣neyaunce, whyche is establyshed ful ferre fro ryght lowe thynges, and beholdeth frome a ferre all thynges, right as it were fro the hye heyght of thynges. Why askest thou than, or why dysputest thou thā, that thylke thynges ben done by necessyte, whyche that ben ysene and yknowen by the deuyne syght, sythe that forsoth men ne maken nat thylke thynges ne¦cessarye, whyche that they sene ben ydone in her syght, for addeth thy beholdynge any ne∣cessyte, to thylke thynges which thou behol∣dest present?</P>

<P>Certes ({quod} she) than, yf men myghten maken anye digne cōparyson or collacyon of the presence dyuyne, and of the presence of mankynde: right so as ye sene some thynges in this tem∣porall presence, ryght so seeth god all thynge by his eterne presence, wherfore this diuyne prescience ne chaungeth not the nature of the
<PB N="cclxvi" REF="279"/>
propertie of thinges, but beholdeth such thin¦ges present to him ward, as they shulden be∣tyden to you warde in tyme to comen. Ne it ne confoundeth not the iugementes of thyn∣ges, but by one syght of hys thought he kno∣weth the thynges to comen, as well necessa∣ry as not necessary. Right so whan ye sene to∣gyther a man walke on the erth, and y<SUP>e</SUP> sunne arysen in the heuen, all be it so that ye sene to∣gyther that one and that other: yet neuerthe∣lesse ye demen and discernen, that that one is voltūary, and that other is necessary: Ryght so than the diuyne lokyng, beholding al thin∣ges vnder hym, ne troubleth nat the qualyte of thynges that ben certaynly present to him warde, but as to the condycyon of tyme, for∣soth they ben future, for whiche it foloweth, that this nys none opinyon, but rather a sted fast knowynge ystrengthed by sothnesse, that whan that god knoweth any thynge to be, he ne vnwote nat that thilke thyng wanteth ne¦cessyte to be, thys is to sayne, that whan that god knoweth any thynge to betyde, he wote well y<SUP>t</SUP> it ne hathe no necessyte to betyde. And yf thou seyst here that thylke thynge that god s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth to betyde, it ne maye not vnbetyde, as who sayth it mote betyde, and thilke thynge that ne may nat vnbetyde, it mote betyden by necessyte, &amp; that thou streyn me to this name of the necessyte. Certes I wyll well confessen and be knowen a thyng of full sad trouth, but vnneth shall there any wyght mowe sene it or come therto, but yf that he be beholder of the deuyne thought, for I wyll answere the thus, that thylke thyng that is future, whē it is referred to the deuyne knowyng, than it is necessary. But certes whan it is vnderstandē in hys own kynde, men sene it vtterly fre and absolute fro al necessyte. For certes there ben two maners of necessytees, that one necessyte is symple, as thus, that is behoueth by neces∣syte, that all men ben mortall or deedly. Ano∣ther necessyte is condicyonel, as thus, if thou wost that a man walketh, it behoueth by ne∣cessyte that he walke, thylke thyng than that any wight hath yknowe to be, it ne maye nat be none otherwyse than he knoweth it to be. But this condicion ne draweth nat with her thilk necessyte simple, for certes this necessite condicionall, y<SUP>e</SUP> propre nature of it ne maketh it nat, but the adiection of the condycyon ma∣keth it. For no necessyte ne constrayneth a mā to gone, that goth by his propre wyll, al be it so that whan he goth, that it is necessary that he gothe. Right on this same maner than, yf that the purueyaunce of god seeth any thyng present, thā mote thylke thynge ben by neces∣syte, although that it ne haue no necessyte of his owne nature. But certes the futures that betyden by fredom of arbytrie, god seeth hem al togyder present. These thynges thā if they ben referred to the deuyne syght, than ben they maked necessary by the condicyon of the deuyne knowyng. But certes, yf thylke thyn∣ges ben consydered by hem selfe, they ben ab∣solute of necessyte, and ne forleten not, ne ces∣sen nat of the lyberte of her own nature. Thā certes wythout doute all the thynges shullen ben don, whyche that god woot beforne that they ben to comen and betyden of free arby∣trie, or of frewyll, that al be it so that they be∣tyden, yet algates ne lese they not her propre nature in beynge, by the whyche fyrst or they weren done, they hadden power not to haue betyde.</P>

<P>What is thys to sayne than ({quod} I) that thynges ne be not necessarye by her propre nature, so that they comen in all ma∣ners in the lykenesse of necessyte, by condicyō of the diuyne science?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philo.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the dif∣ference ({quod} she) that tho thynges whyche that I purposed the a lytell here beforne, that is to sayn, sonne arysyng, and the man walkyng that therwhyles that thylke thynges ben done, they ne myght not ben vndone. Nathe∣lesse that one of hem or it was done, it beho∣ueth by necessyte that it was doone, but not that other. Ryght so it is here that the thyn∣ges whych that god hath present, withouten doute they shullen ben, but some of hem dys∣cendeth of the nature of thynges, as y<SUP>e</SUP> sunne arysynge, and some discendeth of the power of the doers, as the man walkynge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Boece.</SPEAKER>
<P>Than sayde I, no wrong, that yf these thyn∣ges be referred to the diuyne knowyng, than ben they necessarye, and yf they ben consy∣dred by hem selfe, than ben they absolute fro the bonde of necessyte. Ryght so as all thyn∣ges that apereth or sheweth to the wyttes, yf thou referre hem to reason it is vnyuersal, and yf thou loke it or refer it to it selfe, than is it synguler. But nowe yf thou sayest thus, that yf that it be in my power to chaungen my purpose, than shall I voyden the pour∣ueyaunce of god, whan perauenture I shall

haue chaunged the thynges whyche that he knoweth beforne.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Than shall I answe∣ren the thus: Certes thou mayst wel chaūge thy purpose, but for as moche as the present sothnesse of the diuyne purueyaunce behol∣deth that thou mayste chaunge thy purpose, and whether thou chaunge it or no, and why derwarde that thou tourne it, thou ne mayste not eschue the diuyne prescience: right so thou ne mayste not flye the syght of the present eye all though that thou tourne thy selfe by thy fre wyll in to dyuers actiōs. But thou mayst sayne ayen to thys thus: Howe shall it than be, shall not the diuyne science ben chaunged by my dysposycion, whan that I wyll one thyng nowe, and nowe another thyng? And thylke prescience ne semeth it not to entre∣chaunge stoundes of knowing, as who saith ne shall it not semen to vs, that the dyuyne prescience entrechaungeth hys dyuers stoū∣des of knowynge, so that it knowe somtyme one thynge, and somtyme it knoweth the con¦trarye of that thynge? Philo.</P>
<P>No forsothe ({quod} she) for the diuyne syght renneth beforne and seeth al the futures, and clepeth hem ayen, and retourneth hem to the propre prescience of hys propre knowynge, ne he entrechaungeth not, so as thou wenest the stoundes of hys foreknowynge, as nowe this, nowe that: but he dwellyng aye cometh beforne, and enbraseth at o stroke all the mu∣tacions. And this prescience to compreheden and to sene all thynges, god ne hath not takē it of the betydinges of thynges to comen, but of hys propre symplicite. And hereby is assoy¦led thylke thynges that thou puttest a lytell here beforne, that is to sayn, that it is vnwor∣thy thyng to sayne y<SUP>t</SUP> our futures yeuen cause of the presciēce of god. For certes strength of the diuyne science, whyche that enbraseth all thynges by his presentarie knowynge, esta∣blyssheth maner to all thynges, and it ne o∣weth not to latter thynges. And sythe y<SUP>t</SUP> these thynges ben thus, that is to sayne, that neces∣syte is not in thynges by the diuyne pre∣science, than is there fredom of arbytrie that dwelleth hole and vnwemmed to mortal mē, ne the lawes ne purposen not wycked medes and paynes to the wyllynges of men, that ben vnboundē and quyte of all necessyte: And god beholder &amp; foreweter of al thinges dwel¦leth aboue, and the presente eternyte of syght renneth alwaye wyth the dyuers qualyte of our dedes, dispensynge or ordeynyng medes to good men, and tourmentes to wycked mē. Ne in ydell ne in vayne ne ben there not put in god hope and prayers, that ne mowen not ben vnspedefull, ne wythout effecte, whan they ben ryghtfull.</P>
<P>Withstande than and eschew thou vices, worshyppe and loue thou vertues, areyse thy corage to rightful hopes, yelde thou humble prayers and hyghe. Great necessyte of pro∣wesse and of vertue is encharged and com∣maūded to you yf ye nyll not dissimulen, syth that ye worchen and doone, that is to sayne, your dedes and your werkes beforn the eyen of the iuge, that seeth and also that demeth al thynges.

<HEAD>The conclusions of the Astro∣labie.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>Itell Lowys my sunne, I perceyue well by cer∣tayne euydēces thyne abi∣lite to lerne sciences, tou∣chyng nombres, and pro∣porcions: and also wel cō∣sydre I thy besye prayer in especyall to lerne the tretyse of the Astro∣labe. Than for as moche as a philosopher sayth, he wrappeth hym in hys frēde, that cō∣descendeth to the ryghtfull prayers of hys frende: Therfore I haue gyuen the a suffy∣cient Astrolaby for our orizonte, compowned after the latytude of Oxenford: vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> whi∣che by medyacyon of thys lytell treatyse, I purpose to teache the a certayne nombre of conclusyons, pertayning to this same instru∣ment. I saye a certayne of conclusyons for thre causes, the fyrst cause is this. Truste wel that all the conclusyons that haue be foundē, or els possyblye myght be founde in so noble an instrument as is the Astrolabye, ben vn∣knowen perfytely to any mortall man in this regyon, as I suppose. Another cause is thys, that sothlye in any cartes of the Astrolabye that I haue ysene, there ben some conclusyōs, that woll not in all thynges perfourme her byhestes: and some of hem ben to harde to thy tender age of ten yere to conceyue. This trea¦tyse deuyded in fyue partes wyll I shewe the wonder lyght rules and naked wordes in en∣glishe, for latyn ne canste thou yet but smale, my lytell sonne. But neuer the lesse suffyseth to the these trewe conclusyons in englysshe, as well as suffyseth to thys noble clerkes Grekes these same conclusyons in greke, and to arabyens in arabyke, and to iewes in He∣brewe, &amp; to the Latyn folke in Latyn: which Latyne folke had hem fyrste out of other dy∣uers langages, and wryte hem in her owne tonge, that hys to sayne in Latyne.</P>
<P>And god wote that in all these langua∣ges and in manye mo, haue these conclusy∣ons ben suffycyently lerned and taught, and yet by dyuers rules, ryght as dyuers pathes leadē dyuers folke the ryght waye to Rome.</P>
<P>Nowe woll I praye mekely euery person discrete, that redeth or hereth thys lytell trea∣tyse, to haue my rude entendyng excused and my superfluyte of wordes, for two causes. The fyrst cause is, for that curyous endytyng and harde sentences is full heuy at ones, for suche a chylde to lerne. And the seconde cause is thys, that sothly me semeth better to wry∣ten vnto a chylde twyse a good sentence, than he forgette it ones. And Lowis if it so be that I shewe the in my lyth Englysshe, as trewe conclusyons, touchynge thys mater, and not onely as trewe, but as many and subtyll con∣clusyons as ben yshewed in Latyne in anye commune tretyse of the Astrolabye, conne me the more thanke, and pray God saue the kyng that is lorde of thys language, and all that hym faythe beareth, and obeyeth eueryche in hys degre, the more and the lasse. But con∣sydreth well, that I ne vsurpe not to haue founden thys werke of my labour or of myne engyne, I nam but a leude compylatour of the labour of olde Astrologiens, and haue it translated in myne Englysshe onelye for thy doctryne: and wyth thys swerde shal I sleue enuye.</P>

That is a thynge (quod she) that may drawē many hertes of noble, and voyce of cōmune in to glorye, and fame is not but wretched and fyckle.</P>
<P>Alas that mankynde coueyteth in so leude a wyse, to be rewarded of any good dede, sith glorye of fame in this worlde, is not but hyn¦drynge of glorye in tyme cōmynge.

And prycke is wōder lytell in respecte of al y<SUP>e</SUP> cercle, and yet in al this prycke may no name be borne in maner of peersyng for many obstacles, as waters and wylder∣nesse, and straunge langages, and not onely names of men ben stylled and holden oute of knowlegynge by these obstacles, but also cy∣ties &amp; realmes of prosperite ben letted to be know, and theyr reason hyndred, so that they mow not ben parfytly in mennes proper vn¦derstandynge. Howe shulde then the name of a synguler londenoys passe the gloryous name of London, whyche by many it is com¦mended, and by many it is lacked, and in ma∣ny mo places in erthe not knowen, then kno∣wen: for in many countrees lytel is London in knowyng or in speche, and yet among one maner of people may not suche fame in good¦nesse come, for as many as praysen comenly as many lacken. Fye then on suche maner fame, slepe and suffre hym that knoweth pre∣uyte of hertes, to dele suche fame, in thylke place there nothynge ayenst a sothe shal ney∣ther speake ne dare appere, by atturney ne by other maner.

But yf thou wolte make compari∣son to euer, what ioy mayst thou haue in erth¦lye name, it is a fayre lykenesse, a pees or one grayne of wheate, to a thousand shyppes ful of corne charged.

<P>O thys wrongful sterynge so soone other wysed out of knowynge, but for my purpose was at my begynnynge, and so dureth yet, yf God of hys grace tyme woll me graunt, I thynke to perfourme thys worke, as I haue begonne in loue, after as my thynne wytte, with inspiracion of him that hildeth al grace woll suffre. Greuously god wotte haue I suf¦fred a great throwe that the romayne Empe¦rour, whyche in vnite of loue shulde accorde and euery wyth other, in cause of other to a∣uaunce, and namely sythe thys empyre to be corrected of so many sectes in heresie, of faith, of seruyce, o rule in loues religion. Trewlye al were it but to shende errontous opinions, I maye it no lenger suffre: for many menne there ben that sayne loue to ben in grauel and sande, that wyth see ebbynge and flowynge woweth, as ryches that sodaynly vanysheth And some sayne that loue shuld be in wyndy blastes, that stoundmele turneth as a phane, and glorye of renome, whyche after lustes of the varyaunt people is areysed or stylled. Many also wenen that in the sonne and the moone, and other sterres, loue shulde ben foū¦den, for amonge all other planettes moste so∣ueraynly they shynen, as dygnityes in reue∣rence of estates rather then good han and oc∣cupyen.

<P>Also many tonges of great false techinges in gylynge maner, principally in my tymes, not only wyth wordes, but also wyth armes loues seruauntes and professe in hys religyō of trewe rule, pursewen to confoūden and to dystroyen. And for as moche as holy fathers that oure christen faythe aproued and streng∣thed to the iewes, as to mē resonable, and of dyuinite lerned, proued thilke fayth with re∣sones, and wyth authorities of the olde testa∣ment &amp; of the newe, her pertinacye to distroy But to paynyms, that for beestes and houn∣des were holde, to put hem out of theyr er∣rour, was myracles of god shewed.

But I louers clerke in all my con∣nyng and with al my mightes, truly I haue no such grace in vertue of myracles, ne for to dyscomfyte falsheedes, suffyseth not authori∣tes alone, sythen that suche heretykes and mayntenours of falsytes. Wherfore I wote wel sythen that they ben men, and reason is approued in hem, the clowde of erroure hath her reason bewonde probable resons, whych that catchende wyt rightfully may not with sytte. By my trauaylynge studye I haue or∣deyned hem, wyth y<SUP>e</SUP> authorite mysglosed by mannes reason, to graunt shall be enduced.</P>
<P>Now gynneth my penne to quake, to thyn¦ken on the sentences of the enuyous people, whych alwaye ben redy, both ryder and goer to skorne and to iape thys leude boke, and me for rancoure &amp; hate in theyr hertes they shul∣len so dyspyse, that althoughe my booke be leude, yet shall it ben more leude holden, and by wycked wordes in many maner apayred. Certes me thynketh the sowne of theyr bad speche, ryght nowe is full both myne eares. O good precious Margarite, myne herte shulde wepe yf, I wyste ye token hede of suche maner speche, but trewly I wotte wel in that your wysedom shal not asterte. For of god maker of kynde wytnesse I toke, that for none enuy ne yuell haue I drawe thys mat∣ter together, but onely for goodnesse to main∣tayne, and errours in falsytees to destroye. Wherfore (as I sayde) wyth reason I thyn∣ke, thylke forsayd errours to distroye and de∣quace.</P>
<P>These reasons and suche other, yf they en∣duce men in loues seruyce, trewe to beleue of parfyte blysse, yet to full fayth in credence of deserte, fully mowe they not suffise, sythen faythe hath no meryte of mede, when man∣nes reason sheweth experience in doynge. For vtterlye no reason the parfyte blysse of loue by no waye may make to be comprehen¦ded. Lo what is a parcell of louers ioye, par¦fyte scyence in good seruyce, of theyr desyre to comprehende in bodely doynge the lykyng of the soule, not as by a glasse to haue con∣templacyon of tyme comynge, but thylke fyrste ymagyned and thought, after face to face in beholdynge: what herte, what rea∣son, what vnderstandynge can make hys he∣uen to be feled and knowe wythout assaye in doynge? certes none. Sythen then of loue cometh suche fruyte in blysse, and loue in him selfe is the moste amonge other vertues, as clerkes sayne: The sede of suche spryngynge in all places, in all countreys, in al worldes shulde ben sowe.</P>
<P>But o welawaye thylke sede is forsake, &amp; mowen not ben suffred the lāde tyllers to see a werke, wythout medlynge of cockle, badde wedes whych somtyme stonken, hath caught the name of loue amonge ydiotes and badde meanynge people.

A fynal cause is noblerer or els euen as no∣ble as thylke thynge that is fynally to thilke ende, wherfore accion of thyng euerlastyng, is demed to be eternal, and not temporal, sy∣then it is his fynal cause: Ryght so the actes of my boke loue, and loue is noble, wherfore though my boke be leude, the cause w<SUP>t</SUP> which I am stered, and for whom I ought it done, noble forsothe ben bothe.

Certes al maner lynage of men ben euen liche in byrth, for one father maker of al goodnes enformed hem all, &amp; al mortal folke of one sede arne greyned, wherto auaūt men

Let be (quod she) thou errest right foule dignite with badnes is helper to perfourme the felonous doynge: pardy were it kyndly good or any propertie of kyndly vertue had∣den in hem selfe, shrewes shulde hem neuer haue, wyth hem shulde they neuer accorde. water and fyre that ben cōtrarious mowen not togyther bene assembled, kynde wol not suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e suche contraryes to ioyne, &amp; sythen at eye by experiēce in doyng, we sene that shre∣wes haue hem more often thā good menne, syker mayste thou be, y<SUP>e</SUP> kyndly good in suche thynges is not appropred.

And thys same reason (quod she) maye be made in generall on all the bodily goodes, for they comen ofte to throw out shrewes. After this he is strōg that hath myght to haue great burthyns, &amp; he is lyght and swyfte that hathe souerante in runnynge to passe other ryghte so he is a shrewe on whō shreude thynges and badde han most wyrchyng.

Than (quod she) a shrewe for hys shreudnesse, all tho he be put forth to forne o∣ther for ferd, yet is he worthy for shreudnes to be vnworshypped: of reuerence no part is he worthy to haue, to cōtrarious doyng be∣longeth and that is good skyl.

But though a wight had ben mayre of your citie manye wynter togyther, and come in a straunge place ther he were not knowen, he shuld for his dignite haue no reuerence.

Was not Nero the moost shrewe one of thylke that men rede, &amp; yet had he power to make senatours, iustices &amp; princes of ma¦ny landes? was not that great power?

How many ensamples canst thou remē∣bre of kynges great and noble, and huge po∣wer holden, &amp; yet they myghte not kepe hem selue from wretchednesse. Howe wretched was kyng Henry Curtmantyll er he deyed? he had not so moch as to couer w<SUP>t</SUP> hys mem∣bres: and yet was he one of the greatest kin∣ges of al the Normandes of sprynge, &amp; most possession had. O, a noble thinge and clere is power, that is not founden myghty to kepe hym selfe. Nowe trewly a greate fole is he, that for such thyng wolde sette the knotte in thyne herte. Also power of realmes is not thylk greatest power amonges the worldly powers rekened? And yf suche powers han wretchednesse in hem selfe, it foloweth other powers of febler condicion to ben wretched, and than that wretchednesse shulde be cause of such a knotte. But euery wyght that hath reason wote well that wretchednesse by no waye maye bene cause of none suche knotte, wherfore such power is no cause. That po∣wers haue wretchednesse in hem selfe, maye ryght lyghtly bene preued. If power lacke on any side, on that side is no power, but no power is wretchednesse: for al be it so the po¦wer of emperours or kynges, or els of theyr realmes (whych is the power of the prynce) stretchen wyde and brode, yet besyde is ther mokell folke of whyche he hath no cōmaun∣dement ne lordshyp, &amp; ther as lacketh his po¦wer, hys nonepower entreth, where vnder spryngeth that maketh hem wretches. No power is wretchednesse, and nothynge els: but in this maner hath kinges more porcion of wretchednesse thā of power. Trewly such powers bene vnmighty, for euer they ben in drede howe thylke power frō lesinge may be keped of sorowe, so drede sorily prickes euer in their hertes: litle is y<SUP>e</SUP> power which careth &amp; ferdeth it selfe to maintayn.

Ergo power in nothing shulde cause such knottes. wretchednesse is a kynd∣ly propertie in suche power, as by waye of drede, whiche they mowe not eschewe ne by no way lyne in sikernesse. For thou wost wel ({quod} she) he is nought mighty that wold done y<SUP>t</SUP> he may not doone ne perfourme.

Thus by these accordaūces, discor¦daūtes ben ioyned, and in a maner of accor∣daunce they accorden by connection, that is knyttyng togyther: of that accorde cōmeth a maner of melody y<SUP>t</SUP> is ryght noble. Ryght so good and bad are contrarye in doinges, by lackyng and praysyng: good is both lacked and praysed of some, and bad is both lacked and praysed of some: wherfore theyr contra¦rioustie accorde both by lackynge and pray∣syng. Than foloweth it, though good be ne∣uer so mokel praysed, oweth more to bē knit than the bad: or els bad for the renome that he hath, must be takē as wel as y<SUP>e</SUP> good, and that oweth not. No forsoth ({quod} I) wel, {quod} she than is renome no way to the knot: Lo fole ({quod} she) howe clerkes writen of suche glorye of renome. O glorie, glorie, thou arte none other thynge to thousandes of folke, but a great sweller of eares. Many one hath had full greate renoume by false opynion of va∣ryaunt people: And what is fouler thā folke wrongfully to ben praysed, or by malyce of the people gyltelesse lacked? nedes shame fo¦loweth therof to hem y<SUP>t</SUP> with wronge pray∣seth, and also to the desertes praysed, and vi¦lanye and reprofe of hym that disclaūdreth.</P>
<P>Good chylde (quod she) what echeth suche renome to the conscience of a wyse man that loketh and measureth his goodnesse, not by sleuelesse wordes of the people, but by sothe fastnesse of conscience? by god nothyng. And if it be fayre a mans name be eched by moch folkes praysyng, and fouler thynge that mo folke not praysen. I sayde to the a lytle here beforne, that no folke in straunge countries nought praysen, suche renoume may not co∣men to theyr eares, bycause of vnknowyng and other obstacles, as I sayde: wherfore more folke not praysen, and that is ryghte foule to hym that renome desyreth, to wete¦lesse folke praysen than renoume enhaunce. I trowe the thanke of a people is nought worth in remembraunce to take, ne it proce∣deth of no wyse iudgement, neuer is it sted∣fast perdurable: it is veyne and flying, with wynde wasteth and encreaseth.</P>

<P>Lo nowe at all proues, none of all these thinges mowe perfectlye ben in vnderstan∣dyng, to ben way to the duryng blysse of the knot.

Ne y<SUP>t</SUP> in gettyng of the knot, may it nothyng auayle. A wyse gentyll hert loketh after vertue, &amp; non other bodily ioyes alone. And bycause toforne this, ī tho wayes I was sette, I wote wel my selfe I haue er∣red, &amp; of the blysse fayled, &amp; so out of my waye hugely haue I ron.

In good trouth ({quod} I) here is a good begynnyng, yeue vs more of this way. (Quod she) I sayd to y<SUP>e</SUP> nat longe sythen, that resonable lyfe was one of thre thynges, &amp; it was proued to the soule. euerye soule of reason hath two thynges of steryng lyfe, one in vertue and another in the bodily workynge: and whan the soule is the maister ouer the body, than is a man maister of hym selfe: &amp; a mā to be a maister ouer him selfe, lyueth in vertue and in goodnesse, &amp; as reson of vertue techeth, so the soule &amp; the bo∣dy worchyng vertue togider lyuen resonable lyfe, which clerkes clepen felycite in lyueng, and theryn is the hye way to this knot, these olde philosophers that hadden no knowyng of diuyne grace of kyndly reason alone, wen∣den that of pure nature, wythoutē any helpe of grace, me might haue yshoued thother ly∣uenges, resonablye haue I lyued: and for I thynke herafter, yf god woll (&amp; I haue space) thylk grace after my leude knowyng declare: I leaue it as at thys tyme.

Than hathe that man so tourmented suche power, that he nyll be discōfit, ne ouer∣come may he nat ben, sythen pacience in hys soule ouercometh, and as nat ouercomen. Suche thyng that may nat be a maistred, he hath nede to nothyng, for he hath suffisaunce ynowe to helpe him selfe. And thylke thyng that thus hath power and suffysaunce, &amp; no tyrant may it reue, &amp; hath dignyte to sette at nought all thynges, here it is a great dignite that deth may a maistry.

Thus ({quod} she) I woll declare eueryche qualyte and eue¦ry action, and euery thyng that hath any ma∣ner of beynge it is of god, and god it made, of whom is all goodnesse and all beyng, of him is no badnesse: badde to be is naught: good to be is somwhat, and therfore good and beyng is one in vnderstandyng. Howe may this be ({quod} I) for often han shrewes me assayled, and mokell badnesse therin haue I founden, &amp; so me semeth bad to be somwhat in kynde? Thou shalt ({quod} she) vnderstande that suche maner badnesse, whyche is vsed to purifye wronge doers is somwhat, and god it made and beyng hath, and that is good: other bad∣nesse no beyng hath vtterly, it is in the nega∣tyue of somwhat, and that is naught, and no thyng beyng. The parties essenciall of beyng arne sayde in double wyse, as that it is, and these parties ben founde in euerye creature, for all thynge a this halfe the fyrste beyng is beyng through partycipacion, takyng partye of beyng, so that euerye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eature is dyfference bytwene beynge and of hym through whom it is &amp; hys owne beyng: ryght as euery good is a maner of beynge, so is it good thorowe beynge, for it is naught other to be: and eue∣ry thynge though it be good it is not of hym selfe good, but it is good by that it is ordina∣ble to the great goodnesse. This dualite after clerkes determission is founden in euery crea¦ture, be it neuer so syngle of onhed. Ye ({quod} I) but there as it is ysayd that god sawe euery thynge of his makyng, and were right good, as youre selfe sayde to me not longe tyme sy∣then. I aske whether euery creature is ysayd good, throughe goodnesse vnfourmed eyther els fourmed, and afterwarde yf it be accepte vtterly good? I shall saye the ({quod} she) these great passed clerkes han deuyded good in to good beyng alone, and that is nothynge but good, for nothynge is good in that wyse but god. Also in good by partycipacion, and that is ycleped good, for farre fette and representa¦tyue of goodly goodnesse, and after thys ma∣nyfolde good is sayd, that is to saye, good in kynde and good in gendre, and good of grace and good of ioye. Of good in kynde Austen saythe, all that ben ben good: But peraunter thou woldest wete whether of hem selfe it be good, or els of anothers goodnesse, for natu∣rel goodnesse of euery substaunce is nothyng els than his substanciall beyng, whiche is y∣cleaped goodnesse, after comparyson that he hath to his fyrste goodnesse, so as it is induc∣tatyfe by meanes in to the fyrste goodnesse. Boece sheweth thys thynge at the full, that this name good is in general name in kynde as it is comparysoned generally to his prin∣cypal ende, whyche is god, knotte of al good¦nesse. Euery creature cryeth god vs made, &amp; so they han full apered to thylke god by af∣fection, suche as to hem longeth: and in thys wyse all thynges ben good of the great god, whyche is good alone. Thys wonder thyng ({quod} I) howe ye haue by manye reasons pro∣ued my fyrst way to be errour and misgoyng and cause of baddesse and feble meuynge in the grounde ye aleged to be roted: whence is it that suche badnesse hathe sprynges, sythen all thynges thus in generall ben good, and badnesse hathe no beynge, as ye haue decla∣red? I wene if al thinges ben good, I might than wyth the fyrst waye in that good haue ended, and so by goodnesse haue comen to blysse in your seruyce desyred. All thynge ({quod} she) is good by beyng in partycipacion out of the fyrst goodnesse, whyche goodnesse is cor∣rupte by badnesse, and badde meanyng ma∣ners: god hathe in good thynges that they ben good by beyng, and not in yuel, for there is absence of ryghtfull loue, for badnesse is nothynge but onelye yuell wyll of the vser, and through gyltes of the doer, wherfore at the gynnyng of the worlde, euery thynge by hym selfe was good, and in vnyuersall they werne ryght good. An eye or a hande is fay∣rer and betterer in a body sette in his kyndely place, than from the body disceuered. Euerye thing in his kyndly place being kyndly, good dothe werche, and out of that place voyded, it dissolueth and is defouled him selue.

What wenest thou I reioyce or els accompte hym amonge my seruaūtes that pleaseth Pallas, in vndoynge of Mer∣curye, all be it that to Pallas he be knytte by tytle of lawe, not accordyng to reasonable cō∣science: and Mercurye in doynge haue grace to ben suffered: or els hym that weneth the moone for fayrenesse of the eue sterre. Lo o∣therwhyle by nyghtes lyght of the moone, greatlye comforteth in derke thoughtes and blynde. Vnderstandyng of loue yeueth great gladnesse: who so lyste not byleue whan a sothe tale is shewed, adewe and a deblys his name is entred. Wyse folke and worthy in gentyllesse bothe of vertue and of lyuyng ye∣uen full credence in sothnesse of loue wyth a good hert, there as good euydence or expe∣ryence in doynge sheweth not the contrarye. Thus myghtest thou haue full prefe in thy Margarytes goodnesse, by commendement of other iewels badnesse, and yuelnesse in doynge. Stoundemele diseases yeueth seue∣rall houres in ioye.</P>
<P>Nowe by my trouthe ({quod} I) thys is well declared that my Margaryte is good, for sy∣then other ben good, and she passeth manye other in goodnesse and vertue, wherthrough by maner necessarye she muste be good: and goodnesse of thys Margaryte is no thynge els but vertue, wherfore she is vertuous, and yf there fayled any vertue in any syde, there were lacke of vertue: badde nothynge els is ne maye be, but lacke and wante of good and goodnesse, and so shulde she haue that same lacke, that is to saye badde, and that maye not be, for she is good, and that is good me∣thynketh all good: and so by consequence me semeth vertuous and no lacke of vertue to haue. But the sonne is not knowe but he shyne, ne vertuous herbes but they haue het kynde werchynge, ne vertue but it stretche in goodnesse or profyte to another, is no vertue▪ Than by all wayes of reason, sythen mercye and pytie ben moste commended amonge o∣ther vertues, and they myght neuer ben she∣wed refreshement of helpe and of comforte, but nowe at my moste nede, and that is the kynde werkynge of these vertues: trewely I wene I shall not varye frome these helpes. Fyre and yf he yeue non heate, for fyre is not demed. The sonne but he shyne for sonne is not accompted, water but it wete, the name shall ben chaunged. Vertue but it werche of goodnesse dothe it fayle, and in to his contra∣rye the name shall ben reuersed, and these bē impossyble: wherfore the contradictorie that is necessarye, nedes muste I leue.</P>
<P>Certes ({quod} she) in thy person and out of thy mouthe these wordes lyen well to ben sayd, and in thyne vnderstandyng to be leued, as in entent of thys Margaryte alone: and here now my speche in cōclusyon of these wordes.</P>

Prouerbes of Salomon openly tea∣cheth, howe somtyme an innocent walkyd by the waye in blyndnesse of a derke nyght, whom mette a woman (yf it be lefely to saye) as a strumpet arayed, redily purueyed in tur¦nynge of thoughtes with veyne ianglynges and of rest inpacient by dissymulacion of my termes, sayeng in thys wyse: Come &amp; be we

dronken of our swete pappes, vse we couey∣tous collynges. And thus drawen was this innocent, as an oxe to the larder. Ladye ({quod} I) to me this is a queynte thynge to vnder∣stonde: I praye you of this parable declare me the entent. This innocent ({quod} she) is a scholer lernynge of my lore, in seckyng of my blysse, in whyche thynge the daye of hys thought turnyng enelyneth in to eue, and the sonne of verye lyght faylinge, maketh derke nyght in hys connynge. Thus in derkenesse of many doutes he walketh, and for blynde∣nesse of vnderstandynge, he ne wote in what waye he is in: forsothe suche one may lightly ben begyled. To whome came loue fayned, not clothed of my lyuery, but vnlefull iustye habyte, wyth softe spech and mery, and with fayre honyed wordes heretykes &amp; mysse me∣nynge people skleren and wymplen theyr er∣rours. Austen wytnesseth of an heretyke that in hys fyrst begynnynge he was a man right expert in resones, and swete in hys wordes, and the werkes myscorden. Thus fareth fay∣ned loue in her fyrst werchynges: thou kno∣west these thynges for trewe, thou haste hem proued by experience. Somtyme in doyng to thyn owne person, in which thyng thou hast founde mater of mokel dysease, was not fay∣ned loue redely purueyed thy wyttes to catch and tourne thy good thoughtes? trewlye she hath wounded the conscience of many wyth floryshynge of mokel ianglynge wordes: and good worthe thanked I it for no glose, I am gladde of my prudence thou haste so manlye her veyned. To me arte thou moche holden, that in thy kynde course of good meanyng I returne thy mynde: I trow ne had I shewed the thy Margarite, thou haddest neuer retur¦ned. Of fyrste in good parfyte ioye was euer fayned loue impaciēt, as the water of Siloe whyche euermore floweth wyth stylnesse &amp; priuy noyse, tyll it come nyghe the brynke, &amp; then gynneth it so out of measure to bolne, with nouelleries of chaūgynge stormes, that in course of euery rennynge it is in poynte to spyll al his circuite of cankes. Thus fayned loue priuelye at the fullest of hys flowynge, newe stormes debate to arayse. And all be it that Mercurius often wyth hole vnderstan∣dynge knowen suche peryllous matters, yet Venetiens so lusty ben and so leude in theyr wyttes, that in suche thynges ryght lytell or nought done they fele, &amp; wryttē and cryen to theyr felawes: here is blysse, here is ioy, and thus into one same erroure, mokel folke they drawen. Come they sayne, and be we dron∣ken of our pappes, that ben fallas and lyenge glose, of whych mowe they not souke mylke of helthe, but deedlye venym and poyson cor∣rupcyon of sorowe. Mylke of fallas, is ve∣nym of dyscryte: Mylke of lyeng glose is ve¦nym of corrupcion. Lo what thynge cometh out of these pappes: vse we coueyted collyn∣ges, desyre we and meddle we false wordes wyth sote, and sote wyth false, trewly this is the sorynesse of fayned loue, nedes of these surfettes sycknesse must folowe. Thus as an oxe to thy langoryng deth were thou drawe, the sote of the smoke hath y<SUP>e</SUP> all defased. Euer the deper thou somtyme wadest y<SUP>e</SUP> soner thou it founde: yf it had the kylled it had be lytell wonder. But on that other syde my trewe seruaūt not faynen ne dysceyue conne, sothly theyr doynge is open, my foundement endu∣reth, be the burthē neuer so great, euer in one it lasteth: it yeueth lyfe and blysful goodnesse in the last endes, though the gynnynges ben sharpe. Thus of two contraryes, contrarye ben the effectes. And so thylke Margaryte thou seruest shall sene the by her seruyce oute of peryllous trybulacyon delyuered, bycause of her seruyce into newe dysease fallen, by hope of amendement in the laste ende, wyth ioye to be gladded, wherfore of kynde pure, her mercy wyth grace of good helpe shall she graūt, and els I shal her so straine, that with pyte shall she ben amaystred. Remembre in thyne herte how horrybly somtyme to thyne Margaryte thou trespasest, and in a greate wyse ayenst her thou forfeytest: clepe aye thy mynde, and know thyne owne gyltes. What goodnesse, what bountye, wyth mokell folo∣wynge pyte founde thou in that tyme? were thou not goodlye accepted into grace? by my pluckynge was she to foryeuenesse enclyned.

Wherfore in nombre certayne this werke of my besy leudnesse I thynke to ende and par∣fourme. Ensample by thys world in thre ty∣mes is deuyded: of whych the fyrst is cleped Demacion, that is to say, goyng out of trewe way, and al that tho deyden, in hel were they punyshed for a mans synne, tyll grace &amp; mer∣cy fette hem thence, and there ended the fyrste tyme. The seconde tyme lasteth from the cō∣mynge of merciable grace, vntyll the ende of transytory tyme, in whyche is shewed y<SUP>e</SUP> true way in fordoyng of the badde, and that is y∣cleped tyme of grace: and that thynge is not yeuen by deserte of yeldynge one benefyte for another, but onely through goodnesse of the yeuer of grace in thilke tyme. Who so cā well vnderstande, is shapen to be saued in souled blysse. The thyrd tyme shal gyn when trāsy∣tory thynges of worldes han made their end and that shal ben in ioye, glory, and rest, both body and soule, that well han deserued in the tyme of grace. And thus in that heuen togy∣ther shul they dwel perpetuelly without any ymaginatyfe yuel in any halue. These tymes are fygured by tho thre dayes that oure god was closed in erthe, and in the thyrde arose, shewynge our resurrection, to ioye and blysse of tho that it deseruē, by his merciable grace. So this leud boke in thre maters accordaūt to tho tymes, lyghtly by a good inseer maye ben vnderstande, as in the fyrste erroure of mysse goynge is shewed, with sorowful pyne punyshed is cryed after mercye. In the secōde is grace in good waye proued, whyche is fay¦lynge wythout deserte, thylke fyrst mysse a∣mendynge in correction of tho erroures and euen waye to brynge, wyth comforte of wel∣fare into amendement wexynge. And in the thyrde ioye and blysse graunted to hym that well canne deserue it, and hath sauour of vn∣derstandynge in the tyme of grace. Thus in ioye of my thyrd boke shal the mater be tyl it ende. But speciall cause I haue in my hert to make this processe of a Margarit peerle, that is so precious a gēme with clere and lytel, of which stones or iewel, y<SUP>e</SUP> tōges of vs English people turneth y<SUP>e</SUP> right names, &amp; clepeth hem Margery perles: thus varieth our speche frō many other langages. For trewly Latyn, Frenche, and many mo other langages clea∣peth hem Margery perles, the name Marga∣rites or Margaryte perles: wherfore in that denominacion I wol me acorde to other mēs tonges, in that name clepyng. These clerkes that treaten of kyndes, &amp; studyen out the pro∣pertye there of thynges, sayne the Margarit is a lytel whyte perle, throughout holowe &amp; rounde, and vertuous, and on the see sydes in the more Britayne in muskel shelles of y<SUP>e</SUP> hea¦uenly dewe the best ben engendred: in which by experience ben founde thre fayre vertues.

And the thyrd it is nede∣ful and noble in staunchyng of bloode, there els to moche wolde out ren. To whych perle and vertues me lyst to lyken at this tyme phi¦losophie wyth her thre speces, that is naturel and moral, and resonable: of whych thynges hereth what sayne these great clerkes.

is knowyng of deuynly &amp; manly thin¦ges ioyned wyth studye of good lyuyng, and thys stante in two thynges, that is connyng and opinion: connynge is when a thynge by certaine reson is cōceyued. But wretches and fooles and leude men, many wyll conceyue a thynge and maynteyne it as forsoth, though reson be in the contrarye, wherfore connyng is a straūger. Opinion is whyle a thynge is in none certayne, and hydde from mens very knowlegynge, and by no parfyte reson fully declared, as thus: yf the sonne be so moke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as men wenen, or els yf it be more then the erth For in sothnesse the certayne quantyte of that planet is vnknowen to erthly dwellers, and yet by opinion of some men it is holden for more then mydle erthe. The fyrst spece of phi¦losophye is naturel, whych in kyndely thyn∣ges treten, and sheweth causes of heuen, and strength of kyndely course: as by arsmetryke, geometry, musyke, &amp; by astronomye, teacheth wayes and course of heuens, of planetes, and of sterres aboute heuen and erthe, and other clemetes. The seconde spece is morall, which in order of lyuyng maners techeth, and by re∣son proueth vertues of soule most worthy in our lyuyng, whych ben prudence, iustyce, tem¦peraunce, and strength. Prudence is goodlye wysedome in knowyng of thinges. Strēgth voydeth al aduersitees alyche euen. Tempe∣raunce destroyeth beestial lyuyng, wyth easy bearyng. And iustyce ryghtfully iugeth, and iugyng departeth to euery wyght that is his owne. The thyrde spece turneth into reason of vnderstandynge, al thynges to be said soth and dyscussed, &amp; that in two thynges is deuy∣ded: one is art, another is rethorike, in which two al lawes of mans reason ben grounded or els mayntayned. And for thys booke is all of loue, and therafter beareth hys name, and phylosophie and lawe muste here to acorden by theyr clergiall dyscripciōs: as philosophie for loue of wysedome is declared: Lawe for maynteynaunce of peace is holden, and these with loue must nedes acordē, therfore of hem in this place haue I touched.

<P>Now then, as I haue declared: my boke a∣cordeth with discripciō of thre thynges, &amp; the Margarit in vertue is lykned to philosophie wyth her thre speces. In whych maters euer twey ben acordaūt with bodely reason, &amp; the thyrde with the soule: But in cōclusion of my boke &amp; of thys Margarit peerle in knyttyng together lawe by thre sondry maners shalbe lykened, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to saye, lawe, ryght, &amp; custome, whych I wold declare: all y<SUP>t</SUP> is lawe cometh of goddes ordynaūce by kyndly worchyng, &amp; thylke thynges ordayned by mānes wyttes arne ycleped ryght, which is ordained by ma¦ny maners &amp; in constitucion wrytten: but cu∣stome is a thynge that is accepted for ryghte or for lawe, there as lawe and ryght faylen, and there is no dyfferēce, whether it come of scrypture or of reason. Wherfore it sheweth that lawe is kyndly gouernaunce: Ryght co∣meth out of mannes probable reason: and cu¦stome is of cōmen vsage by length of tyme v∣sed, and custome not wrytte is vsage, and yf it be wrytte constitucion it is ywrytten and ycleped: But lawe of kynde is cōmen to eue∣ry nation, as coniunction of man and womā in loue, succession of chyldren in heritaunce re¦stitucyon of thynge by strength taken or lent and this lawe amōge al other halte the soue∣raynest gree in worshyp, whych lawe began at the begynnynge of reasonable creature, it varyed yet neuer for no chaungyng of tyme: cause forfothe in ordaynynge of law, was to constrayne mens hardynesse into peace, and wythdrawyng his euell wyl, &amp; turnynge ma¦lyce into goodnesse, and that innocence syker¦ly withouten tenefull anoye amōge shrewes safely myght inhabyte by protection of safe∣conducte, so that y<SUP>e</SUP> shrewes harme for harme by brydle of ferdenesse shulden restrayne.

Trewly the ylke that han myght to do good and done it not, the crowne of worshyp shall be take from hem, and wyth shame shull they be anulled. And so to make one werke accor∣daunt wyth hys endes, euery good seruaunt by reason of cōsequēce muste do good nedes. Certes it suffyseth not alone to do good, but goodly wythall folowe, the thanke of good∣nesse els in nought he deserueth: For ryghte as al your beyng come frō the greatest good in whom all goodnesse is closed. Ryght so your endes ben directe to the same good. Ari∣stotel determineth y<SUP>e</SUP> end &amp; good ben one, &amp; cō¦uertible in vnderstandynge, &amp; he that in wyll doth away good, &amp; he that loketh not to thēd loketh not to good, but he that doth good &amp; doth not goodly, draweth away the dyrectiō of thende not goodly, must nedes be bad. Lo badde is nothyng els, but absence or negatyf of good, as derknesse is absence or negatyue of lyght. Then he that doth goodly, dyrecteth thylke good in to thende of badde: So must thyng not good folowe, eke badnesse to suche folke ofte foloweth.

Certes ({quod} loue) bicause this mater is good &amp; necessary to declare, I thynke herein wel to abyde, and not lightly to passe. Thou shalt not ({quod} she) say al only god beforne wot me to be a louer or no louer, but thus: god be forne wot me to be a louer without necessite And so it foloweth whether thou loue or not loue, euery of hem is and shalbe.

<P>Now ({quod} she) thou shalt wel vnderstande, that often we sayne thyng thorow necessitie to be that by no strength to be neyther is co∣acted ne constrayned, and through necessitie not to be, that with no defendynge is remo∣ued, for we sayne it is thorowe necessite god to be immortall nought deedlyche, and it is necessitie god to be ryghtfull, but not that a∣ny strength of vyolente maner constrayneth hym to be immortall, or defendeth him to be vnryghtfull, for nothynge maye make hym deedly or vnryghtful. Ryght so if I say tho∣rowe necessite is the to be a louer or els none onelye thorowe wyll, as god beforne wete: It is not to vnderstande that any thyng de∣fendeth or forbyt, the thy wyll whiche shall not be, or els cōstrayneth it to be which shal∣be: that same thyng forsoth god before wot which he beforne seeth any thynge cōmende of only wyll, that wyl neyther is cōstrayned ne defended thorowe any other thynge: &amp; so thorowe lybertie of arbytrement it is do, y<SUP>t</SUP> is done of wyll.

For whā I say, if loue shalbe of ne∣cessitie it shalbe, here foloweth necessitie, the thyng toforn put, it is as moche to sey, as yf it were thus pronoūced, y<SUP>e</SUP> thing shalbe: none other thynge signifyeth this necessitye but onely thus, y<SUP>t</SUP> shall be maye not togyder be &amp; not be. Euenlyche also it is sothe, loue was and is, &amp; shalbe, not of necessitie, and nede is to haue be all that was, &amp; nedeful is to be al that is, &amp; cōmyng to all that shalbe: and it is not the same to saye, loue to be passed, &amp; loue passed to be passed, or loue present to be pre∣sent, and loue to be present, or els loue to be commynge, and loue commynge to be com∣mynge: dyuersitye in settynge of wordes, maketh diuersitie in vnderstonding altho in the same sentēce they accordē of significatiō ryght as it is not all one: loue sweete to be swete, &amp; loue to be swete: for moche loue is bitter &amp; sorowful er hertes ben eased, &amp; yet it gladeth thilke sorouful hert on suche loue to thynke.

of wyl my hert wil now not accorde this ser¦uice to loue. I can demen in my selfe none o∣therwyse, but thorowe necessitie am I con∣strayned in this seruyce to abyde. But alas than, yf I thorowe nedefull cōpultion ma∣gre me be withholde, lytle thanke for all my great trauayle haue I than deserued. Now ({quod} this lady) I saye as I sayde: Me lyketh this mater to declare at the full, &amp; why? for many men haue had dyuers fantasyes, and reasons, both on one syde thereof &amp; in the o∣ther. Of whiche ryght sone I trowe if thou wolt vnderstōd, thou shalt con yeue the sen∣tence, to the partye more probable by reasō, &amp; in soth knowyng, by y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue of this ma∣ter maked an ende. Certes ({quod} I) of these thī∣ges long haue I had great lust to be lerned, for yet I wene gods wyl &amp; his prescience ac¦cordeth with my seruyce, in louyng of thys precious Margaryte petle. After whō euer in my hert with thurstyng desyre wete I do brenne: vnwastyng I langour &amp; fade, and y<SUP>t</SUP> day of my desteny in deth or in ioy I vnbide but yet in thende I am comforted be my sup¦posayle in blysse, &amp; in ioye to determyne af∣ter my desyres. That thyng ({quod} loue) hastely to the neygh, god graūt of his grace &amp; mer∣cy, and this shalbe my prayer tyl thou be ly∣kende in hert at thyne owne wyll. But now to enfourme the in this mater ({quod} this lady) thou woste where lefte, that was loue to be swete, and loue swete to be swete, is not all one for to saye: for a tree is not alway by ne∣cessitie whyte sometyme er it were whyte, it myght haue be not whyte: &amp; after tyme it is whyte, it maye be not whyte: But a whyte tree euermore nedeful is to be whyte: for nei¦ther toforne ne after it was whyte, myght it be togyther whyte and not whyte. Also loue by necessitie is not present as nowe in y<SUP>e</SUP> for er it were present it myght haue be, that it shulde now not haue be, and yet it may be that it shal not be presente, but thy loue pre∣sent, which to her margarite the hath bond, nedefull is to be present. Truly seme doing of action not by necessitie is cōmyge ferre to forne it be, it maye be that it shal not be com¦myng: thing forsoth comynge nedefull is to be cōmynge, for it may not be that cōmynge shall not be cōmynge: and ryght as I haue sayde of present and of future tymes, y<SUP>e</SUP> same sentence in sothnesse is of the preterit, y<SUP>t</SUP> is to say tyme passed for thīg passed, must nedes be passed, &amp; yet it wer myght haue not be, wherfore it shuld not haue passed. Ryght so whā loue cōming is said of loue y<SUP>t</SUP> is to com¦nedeful is to be y<SUP>t</SUP> is sayd, for thyng cōmyng neuer is not comyng, &amp; so oft the same thing we sayn of the same, as whā we sayn euery man is a man, or euerye louer is a louer, so must it be nedes, in no way may he be mā &amp; no man togyther. And yf it be not by necessi∣tie, that is to say, nedeful al thyng cōmynge to be cōmyng, than som thyng commyng is not cōming, and that is impossible, right as these termes nedefull, necessitie, and neces∣sary betoken and signify thyng nedes to be, &amp; it may not otherwyse be. Ryght these ter∣mes impossyble signifyeth, that thynge is not &amp; by no way may it be, than thorow par¦fyte necessitie, al thyng cōmyng is cōmyng, but that is by necessitie, foloweth with no∣thyng to be cōstrayned: lo whan that com∣myng is sayd of thyng, not alwaye thynge thorowe necessitie is, altho it be commynge. For if I saye tomorowe loue is cōmynge in this Margarites hert, not therfore thorow necessitie shal thilke loue be, yet it maye be y<SUP>t</SUP> it may not be, although it were commynge. Neuerthelater, sōtyme it is soth that some∣thyng be of necessitie, that is sayde to come: as yf I say tomorow by cōmyng the rising of the sun. Yf therfore with necessitie I pro∣nounce cōmynge of thynge to come, in this maner loue to morne cōmynge in thy Mar∣garyte to the warde by necessitie is cōmyng or els the rysyng of the sunne to morne com¦myng, through necessitie is comynge. Loue sothly which may not be of necessitie aloone folowyng, thorowe necessitie cōmynge it is made certayne. For futur of future is sayde, that is to sayne cōmyng of cōminge is saide as if tomorow cōmyng is thorowe necessite cōming it is. Arysyng of the sun thorowe .ii. necessitis in cōming, it is to vnderstād y<SUP>e</SUP> one is to forgoīg necessite, which maketh thing to be, therfore it shalbe, for nedefull is that it be. Another is folowyng necessitie, which nothing cōstrayneth to be, and so by necessi∣te it is to come, why? for it is to come. Now than, whan we sayne, y<SUP>e</SUP> God beforne wote thing cōmyng, nedeful it is to be commyng, yet therfore make we not in certayne, euer∣more thyng to be thorow necessitie cōmyng.
<PB N="cccxliiii" REF="357"/>
Sothly thynge commynge may not be not cōmynge by no waye, for it is the same sen∣tence of vnderstandyng: as yf we saye thus. Yf god beforne wot any thynge, nedefull is that to be commynge. But yet therfore folo∣weth not the prescience of God, thynge tho∣rowe necessitie to be comyng: for all tho god toforne wote all thynges comynge, yet not therfore he beforne wote euery thynge com∣myng thorowe necessetie. Som thynges he beforne wot commynge of frewyll out of re¦sonable creature. Certes ({quod} I) these termes nede and necessitie, haue a queynte maner of vnderstandynge, they wolde dullen manye mens wyttes.

<P>And euer ryght as nedeful is to be what that god woll, ryght so to be it is nedefull, that man woll in tho thynges, whiche that god hath put into mans subiection of wyl∣lynge: as yf a man woll loue, that he loue: &amp; yf he ne wol loue, that he loue not, &amp; of suche other thynges in mans dispositiō. For why nowe than that god woll maye not be, whā he woll the wyll of man thorowe no neces∣sitie to be constrayned or els defended for to wylne, and he woll theffecte to folowe the wyll, than is it nedefull wyll of man to be free, and also to be that he woll. In this ma∣ner it is soth, that thorowe necessitie is mā∣nes werke in louyng, that he wol do althouʒ he woll it not with necessitie. (Quod I) thā how stant it in loue of thylke wyl, sythen mē louē wyllyng of free choyce inhert wherfore yf it be thorowe necessitie, I pray you ladye of an answer this questyon to assoyle.

<P>But yf a man do synne, it is nothyng elles but to wyll, that he shulde not: ryght so syn of wyl is not to be maner necessary done, no more than wyll is necessary. Neuerthelater this is soth, yf a man woll synne, it is neces∣sary hym to synne, but though thylke neces∣sitie nothyng is constrayned ne defended in the wyll, ryght so thylke thyng that frewyll woll and may, and not may, not wylne, and nedefull is that to wylne he may not wylne but thilke to wylne nedefull is, for impossy∣ble to hym it is onethyng, and the same to wylne he may not wilne, but thilke to wilne nedefull is: for impossyble to hym it is one thynge, and the same to wylne and notte to wylne. The werke forsoth of wyl to whome it is yeue that it be that he hath in wyll, and that he wol not voluntary of spontany it is, for by spontany wyll it is do, that is to saye with good wyll, not constrayned: than by wyl not constrayned, it is constrayned to be and that is it may not togyther be. Yf thys necessitie maketh lybertye of wyll, whiche y<SUP>e</SUP> aforne they weren they myght haue bene es∣chewed and shonned: God than, which that knoweth al truthe, and nothyng but truthe, al these thynges as they are spontany or ne∣cessarye syght, and as he seeth so they ben: &amp; so with these thynges well consydered, it is open at the full, that withoute all maner re∣pugnaunce, god beforne wot all maner thin¦ges ben done by frewyll, which aforen they weren myght haue ben neuer they shulde be and yet ben they thorowe a maner necessitie from frewyll discended.</P>

That is soth (quod loue) euer as I sayd, as to hym that doeth good, which to done he were neyther holdē ne yet constrayned. That is soth (quod I). Truly, (quod she) all that euer thou dost to thy mar¦garyte peerle, of wyll, of loue, and of reason thou owest to done it, yet is nothyng els but yeldynge of thy det in quytyng of thy grace, which she the lent whā ye fyrst met. I wene (quod I) ryght lytle grace to me she delyue∣red. Certes, it was harde grace, it hath nigh me astrangled. That it was good grace I wot wel thou wylt it graunt er thou depart hence.

Ergo she was yeuer of the loue although thou it vse, and there lent she the grace thy seruyce to be¦gynne. She is worthye the thanke of this grace, for she was the yeuer. All the though¦tes, besy doinges, and plesaūce in thy might and in thy wordes that thou canste deuyse, ben but ryght lytle in quytynge of thy dette: had she not ben, suche thyng had not ben stu¦dyed. So all these maters kyndly drawen homewarde to this Margaryte peerle, for from thence were they borowed, all is holy her to wyte the loue that thou hauest: and thus quytest thou thy dette, in that thou sted¦fastly seruest. And kepe well that loue I the rede, that of her thou hast borowed, and vse it in her seruyce thy dette to quyte, and than art thou able right sone to haue grace, wher¦fore after mede in none halue mayest thou loke. Thus thy gynnyng and endyng is but grace alone, and in thy good deseruyng thy det thou aquytest: without grace is nothing worth what so euer thou werche. Thanke thy Margaryte of her great grace, that hy∣therto the hath gyded, and praye her of con∣tynuaunce forthe in thy werkes hereafter, and that for no myshappe thy grace ouer∣thwartly tourne. Grace, glorye, and ioye, is commynge thorowe good folkes desertes, and by gettynge of grace therin shulde ende. And what is more glorye or more ioye than wysdome and loue in parfite charitie which god hath graunted to all tho that well can deserue. And with that this lady al at ones start into myne hert: here woll I onbyde ({quod} she) for euer. And neuer woll I gone hence, and I woll kepe the from medlynge whyle me lyst here onbyde: thyne intremetyng ma∣ners into stedfastnesse shullen be chaunged.</P>

How lyghtly me might the fautes espye, howe rules in loue shoulde ben vsed, howe sometyme with fayned loue foule I was begyled, howe I shoulde loue haue knowe, and how I shall in loue wyth my seruyce procede. Also furthermore, I founde of perdurable letters wonderly ther grauen, these maters which I shal nempne. Certes, none age ne other thynge in earthe maye the leest syllable of this in no poynte deface, but clerelye as the sunne in myne vn∣derstandyng soule they shynen. This maye neuer out of my mynde, how I may not my loue kepe, but thorowe wyllynge in herte. wylne to loue maye I not, but I louynge, haue. Loue haue I none but thorowe grace of this Margaryte peerle. It is no maner dout, that wyl woll not loue but for it is lo∣uyng, as wyl woll not ryghtfully, but for it is ryghtful it selue. Also wyll is not louyng for he woll loue, but he woll loue for he is lo¦uynge. It is all one to wyll to be louynge, and louynges in possessyon to haue. Ryght so wyll wol not loue, for of loue hath he in no partye, and yet I deny not louynge wyl wylne more loue to haue, which that he hath not whan he wolde more than he hath: but I saye he maye no loue wylne, yf he no loue haue, throughe whiche thylke loue he shulde wylne: but to haue this louynge wyll may no man of hym selfe, but onely through grace toforne going: Ryght so maye noman it kepe, but by grace folowynge. Consydre nowe euery man aryght, and let sene if that any wyght of hym selfe mowe this louynge wyl get, and he therof fyrste nothynge haue: for yf it shulde of hym selfe sprynge, eyther it must be wyllyng or not wyllynge▪ wyllynge by hym selfe maye he it not haue, sythen him fayleth the mater that shulde it forth bryng, the mater hym fayleth: why▪ he may thereof haue no knowyng, tyll whan grace put it in his herte. Thus wyllyng by hym selfe may he it not haue, and not wyllynge maye he it not haue. Parde euery conceyt of euery rea∣sonable creature otherwyse wyl not graunt wyll in affyrmatyfe with not wyllynge by no waye mowe accorde. And although this louynge woll come in myne hert by frenesse of arbytrement, as in this boke fully is she∣wed, yet owe I not therfore as moche alow my free wyll, as grace of that Margaryte to me leaned, for neyther myght I without grace to fornegoinge, and afterwarde folo∣wyng, thylke grace get ne kepe, and lese shal I it neuer but yf frewyll it make, as in wyl∣lyng otherwyse than grace hath me graun∣ted. For ryght as whan any person taketh wyllynge to be sobre, and throweth that a∣waye, wyllynge to be dronke, or els taketh wyll of drynkynge oute of measure, whiche thyng anon as it is doone, maketh thorowe his owne gylte by free wyll that leseth hys grace. In which thyng therfore vpon the no¦bley of grace I mote trusten, and my busye cure set thylke grace to kepe, that my frewyl otherwyse than by reason it shulde werche, cause not my grace to voyde: for thus must I both loke to frewyll &amp; to grace. For right as naturall vsage in engendrynge of chyl∣dren maye not bene withoute father, ne also but with the mother, for neyther father ne mother in begettynge maye it lacke: ryght so grace and frewyll accorden, and without hem both maye not louynge wyll in no par∣tye ben getten. But yet is not frewyl in get∣tynge of that thyng, so mokell thanke wor∣thy as is grace, ne in the kepynge thereof, so moche thanke deserueth, and yet in gettyng and kepynge both done they accorde.</P>
<P>Trulye oftentyme grace frewyll helpeth in foredoinge of contrarye thynges, that to wyllynge loue not accorden, and strengthe wyll aduersities to withsytte, wherfore all togyther to grace oweth to bene accepted, that my wyllynge deserueth. Frewyll to louynge in this wyse is accorded.</P>

<P>wherfore I saye, euerye wyght hauynge

this ryghtfulnes ryghtfull is, and yet ther∣fore I sey not in my concyence, that to all ryghtfull is behoten the blysse euerlastynge but to hem that ben ryghtfull withouten a∣ny vnryghtousnesse. Some man after som degree maye ryghtfully ben accompted: as chaste men in lyuynge, and yet ben they ian∣glers and full of enuye pressed: to hem shal this blysse neuer bene delyuered. For ryght as verye blysse is withoute all maner nede, ryght so to noman shal it be yeuen but to the ryghtful, voyde from all maner vnryghtful∣nesse founde, so noman to her blysse shal ben folowed, but he be ryghtfull, and wyth vn∣ryghtfulnesse not bounde, and in that degre fully be knowe. This ryghtfulnesse in as moche as in hym selfe is, of none euyll is it cause, and of all maner goodnesse truly it is mother. This helpeth the spyrite to withsyt the leude lustes of fleshly lykyng: This strē∣gtheth and mayntayneth the lawe of kynde and yf that otherwhyle me weneth harme of this precyous thyng to folowe, theretho∣rowe is nothynge the cause, of somwhat els commeth it aboute who so taketh hede. By rightfulnesse forsoth werne many holy sayn¦tes good sauour in swetnesse to god almigh¦tye, but that to some folkes they weren sa∣uour of deth into deedly ende, that come not of the saynctes ryghtwysnesse, but of other wycked mens badnesse hath proceded. Tru∣ly the ilke wyl whiche that the ladye of loue me lerned, affectiō of wyl to nempne, which is in wyllyng of profytable thynges, euel is it not, but whan to fleshly lustes it cōsenteth ayenst reason of soule. But that this thyng more clerely be vnderstand, it is for to know whence and how thylke wyll is so vycious, and so readye, euyll dedes to perfourme. Grace at the gynnyng ordeyned thylke wyl ingoodnesse euer to haue endured, and neuer to badnesse to haue assented: Men shoulde not beleue that God thylke wyll made to be vycious. Our fyrst father as Adam &amp; Eue, for vycyous appetytes and vycious wyll to such appetytes consentyng, ben not one thīg in kynde, other thyng is done for the other. And howe this wyll fyrst into man fyrst as∣sented I holde it profytable to shewe, but if the fyrste condicyon of reasonable ceeature wol be consydred and apertly loked lyghtly the cause of suche wyll maye ben shewed. Intention of God was that ryghtfully and blyssed shulde reasonable nature ben maked hym selfe for to kepe, but neyther blysfull ne ryghtfull myght it not be withouten wyl in them bothe. wyll of ryghtfulnesse is thylke same rightfulnesse as heretoforne is shewed but wyll of blysse is not thylke blysse, for e∣uery man hath not thylke blysse, in whome the wyll therof is abydynge. In this blysse after euery vnderstandyng is suffysaunce of couenable commodityes without anye ma∣ner nede, whether it be blysse of aungelles or els thylke, that grace fyrst in paradyse suffe∣red Adam to haue. For although aungelles blysse be more than Adams was in Para∣dyse, yet may it not be denyed, that Adam in Paradyse ne hadde suffysaunce of blysse, for ryght as great herte is without al maner of coldnesse, and yet maye an other herte more heate haue, ryght so nothyng defruded Adā in Paradyse to bene blessed, without al ma∣ner nede. Although aungels blysse be moche more, forsothe it foloweth not lasse than an other to haue therefore hym nedeth, but for to wante a thynge whiche that behoueth to ben had, that may nede ben cleped, and that was not in Adam at the fyrst gynnynge. God and the Margaryte, weten what I meane.</P>
<P>Forsothe where as is nede, there is wret∣chednesse, good withoute cause to fornego∣inge made not resonable creature wretched, for hym to vnderstand and loue had he fyrst maked. God made therfore mā blyssed with out al maner indigēce, togyther and at ones toke reasonable creature blysse, and wyll of blyssednesse and wyl of rightfulnesse, which is ryghtfulnesse it selfe, and lybertye of arbi∣trement, that is free wyl, with which thilke ryghtfulnesse may he kepe and lese. So and in that wyse ordayned thylke two, that wyl which that instrument is cleped, and here to forne mencyon is maked, shoulde vse thylke ryghtfulnesse by teachynge of hys soule to good maner of gouernaunce, in thought and in wordes, and that it shulde vse the blysse in obedyent maner withouten any incommo∣ditie. Blysse forsothe into mannes profyte, and ryghtwysnesse into his worshyppe god delyuered at ones: but ryghtfulnes so was yeuen, that man myght it lese, whiche yf he not loste hadde not, but continuallye haue it
<PB N="cccxlvi" REF="359"/>
kepte, he shulde haue deserued the auaunce∣ment into the felowshyp of angels, in which thinge yf he that loste, neuer by hym selfe for¦warde shuld he it mowe ayenward recouer: and as well the blysse that he was in, as an∣gels blysse that to himwardes was coming shulde be nome at ones, &amp; he depriued of the both. And thus fyl man vnto likenesse of vn∣reasonable beestes, and with hem to corrup∣cyon and vnlustye appetytes was he vnder, throwen, but yet wyl of blysse dwelleth, that by indigence of goodes whiche that he loste through great wretchednesse, by ryght shuld he bene punyshed. And thus for he weyued, ryghtfulnes, lost hath he hys blysse: but faile of hys desyre in his owne comoditie may he not, and were comodities to hys resonable nature whych he hath lost may he not haue. To false lustes, which ben vestial appetites he is turned: foly of vnconning hath him be∣gyled, in wening that thylke bene the como∣dities that owen to bene desyred. This affec¦tion of wyll by libertie of arbitriment is en∣duced to wylne thys thing that he shuld not and so is wyl not maked yuyll but vnryght∣ful, by absence of rightfulnesse, whych thing by reason euer shulde he haue. And freenesse of arbitriment maye he not wylne, whan he it not haueth, for whyle he it hadde, thylke halpe it not to kepe: so y<SUP>t</SUP> wythout grace may it not bene recouered. Wyll of cōmoditie, in as much as vnryghtful it is maked, by wyl∣lynge of yuell lustes, wyllynge of goodnesse may he not wylne: for wyll of instrument to affection of wyl is thralled, sithen that other thyng maye it not wylne, for wyll of instru∣ment to affection desyreth, and yet bene both they wyl cleped: for y<SUP>e</SUP> instrumēt woll, throuʒ affection it wylneth, and affection desyreth thylke thynge wherto instrumente hym le∣deth. And so frewil to vnlusty affectiō ful ser¦uaunt is maked, for vnryghtfulnesse may he not releue, &amp; wythout ryghtfulnes full fredō may it neuer haue. For kyndly libertie of ar∣bytriment without it, veyne and ydell is for sothe. wherfore yet I saye, as often haue I sayd the same, whan instrument of wyl lost hath rightfulnesse, in no maner but by grace may he ayen returne ryghtfulnesse to wylne For sythen nothyng but ryghtfulnesse alone shulde he wylne, what y<SUP>t</SUP> euer he wylneth w<SUP>t</SUP> oute ryghtfulnesse, vnryghtfullye he it wyl∣neth. These than vnryghtfull appetites and vnthryfty lustes which the flyes desyreth, in as mokell as they bene in kynde, bene they not bad, but they ben vnryghtful and badde for they ben in resonable creature, where as they beyng in no waye shulde bene suffred. In vnreasonable beastes neyther bene they yuell ne vnryghtfull, for there is theyr kynde beyng.</P>

But speci∣allyche predestinacion of goodnesse alone, is sayde by these great clerkes, for in him God doth that they bene, &amp; that in goodnesse they werchen.

Then saye I that no man may shorte ne length the day or∣dayned of hys doyng, altho somtyme to vs it semeth some man to do a thynge of free wyl, wherthorow hys deth he henteth. Naye for∣soth ({quod} she) it is nothynge ayenst my sayenge for god is not begyled, ne he seeth nothynge whether it shal come of lyberte or els of neces¦site, yet it is said to be ordeyned at god immo∣uable, which at mā or it be done may be chaū¦ged. Such thyng also is that Paule the apo∣stel sayth of hem that tofore were purpossed to be sayntes, as thus, whych that god before wyst, &amp; hath predestined, conformes of yma∣ges of hys sonne, that he shulde be the fyrste begotten, that is to say, here amonges many brethrē, &amp; whom he hath predestyned, hem he hath cleped, and whō he hath cleped, hem he hath iustifyed, &amp; whom he hath iustified, hem he hath magnifyed. This purpose after whi∣che they ben cleped sayntes or holy in y<SUP>e</SUP> euer∣lastyng presēt, wheris neither tyme passed ne tyme cōmynge, but euer it is only presente, &amp; nowe as mokel a momēt as seuen thousande wynter, &amp; so ayenwarde wythouten any me∣uyng is nothynge lych temporel presence, for thīge y<SUP>t</SUP> there is euer present. Yet amōges you mē er it be in your presence it is mouable tho¦rowe lyberte of arbytremēt. And ryght as in the euerlastyng present no maner thing was ne shalbe, but only is, &amp; nowe here in your tē∣porel tyme, somthyng was &amp; is, &amp; shalbe, but mouynge stoundes, &amp; in thys is no maner re∣pugnaunce. Right so in the euerlastynge pre∣sence nothynge may be chaūged: &amp; in your tē¦porel tyme other while it is proued mouable by lyberte of wil or it be do, wythoutē any in∣cōuenience therof to folowe. In your tēporel tyme is no such presence as in the tother, for your present is done, when passed &amp; to come gynnē entre, whych tymes here amōges you euerych easely foloweth other, but y<SUP>e</SUP> presence euerlastyng dureth in onehed, wythout any ymaginable chaūgyng, &amp; euer is present and nowe. Truely the course of the planetes &amp; o∣uerwhelmynges of the sonne in dayes &amp; nigh¦tes, with a new gynnyng of his circute after it is ended, that is to sayne, one yere to folow another. These maken your trāsitory tymes wyth chaūgyng of lyues &amp; mutation of peo∣ple. But right as your tēporel presence couey¦teth euery place, &amp; al thinges in euery of your tymes be cōteyned, &amp; as now both sey &amp; wyst to goddes very knowynge. Then ({quod} I) me wōdreth why Paule spake these wordes, by∣voice of significatiō in tyme passed, that god his saītes before wyst, hath predestined, hath cleped, hath iustifyed, &amp; hath magnifyed: Me thynketh he shulde haue sayde tho wordes in tyme present, &amp; that had be more accordaunt to the euerlastynge present, thē to haue spoke in preterit voice of passed vnderstandynge. O ({quod} Loue) by these wordes I se well thou hast lytel vnderstādyng of y<SUP>e</SUP> euerlastyng pre∣sence, or els of my before spoken wordes, for neuer a thing of tho thou hast nēpned was to fore other or after other, but all at ones euen∣lych at y<SUP>e</SUP> god bē, &amp; al together in y<SUP>e</SUP> euerlastīg present be nowe to vnderstādyng, the eternal presence, as I sayd, hath enclose together in one, al tymes, in which close &amp; one al thinges y<SUP>t</SUP> ben in dyuers tymes &amp; in dyuers place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tē∣porel wythout posteriorite or priorite be clo∣sed therin perpetuel now, &amp; maked to dwel in present sight. But there thou sayest y<SUP>t</SUP> Paule shulde haue spoke thilke forsaid sentēce by ty∣me present, &amp; that most shulde haue ben accor∣daunt to the euerlastyng presence, why gab∣best thou to thy wordes: Sothly I say Paul moued y<SUP>e</SUP> wordes by significatiō of tyme pas∣sed, to shewe fully y<SUP>t</SUP> thylke wordes were not put for tēporel signification, for al thilk tyme were not thilk sentēce tēporallich borne whi∣che that Paule pronounced god haue tofore knowe, &amp; haue cleped then magnifyed, wher∣thorow it may wel be know that Paule vsed tho wordes of passed significaciō, for nede &amp; lacke of a word in mānes bodely spech beto∣kenyng the euerlastynge presence. And ther∣fore worde is moste semelyche in lykenesse to euerlastynge presence, he toke his sentēce for thynges that here beforne ben passed, vtterly be immouable, ylyke to y<SUP>e</SUP> euerlasting presēce. As thylke that ben there neuer mowe not be present, so thinges of time passed ne mowe in no wyse not bē passed: but al thinges in your temporal presence that passen in a lytel while shullen ben not present. So then in that it is more similitude to the euerlastyng presence, sygnifycacion of tyme passed, then of tyme temporal present, &amp; so more in accordaunce.

And also it mote ofte ben out of thought, for no re¦membraunce may holde one thynge continu∣ally in herte, be it neuer so lusty desyred.</P>
<P>Nowe se ({quod} she) how thy wyl shal folowe thy frewyl to be groūded cōtinuelly to abyde It is thy fre wil that thou louest and hast lo∣ued, and yet shal louē thys Margaryte perle, and in thy wyl thou thinkest to holde it. Thē is thy wyl knyt in loue, not to chaūge for no newe lust besyde: thys wyll teacheth thyne hert frō al maner varyeng. But thē although thou be thretened in deth or els in otherwyse yet is it in thyne arbitremēt to chose, thy loue to voyde or els to holde: And thylke arbytre∣ment is in a maner a iugement bytwene de∣syre and thy herte. And yf thou deme to loue thy good wyl fayleth, then arte thou worthy no blysse that good wyl shulde deserue: and if thou chose contynuaunce in thy good seruyce then thy good wyll abydeth, nedes blysse fo∣lowīg of thy good wil must come by strēgth of thylke iugement: for thy fyrst wyl y<SUP>t</SUP> taught thyn hert to abyde, &amp; halte it from theschaūge wyth the reson is accorded. Trewly this ma∣ner of wyl thus shal abyd, impossible it were to turne yf thy herte be trewe, &amp; yf euery man dyligently the menynges of hys wyl cōsider, he shall wel vnderstande that good wyl knyt wyth reason, but in a false herte neuer is voy¦ded: for power &amp; myght of kepyng thys good wyl is thorow lyberte of arbytremēt in hert, but goodwil to kepe may not fayle. Eke then yf it fayle, it sheweth it selfe that goodwyl in kepyng is not there. And thus false wyll that putteth out the good, anone constrayneth the herte to accorde in louynge of thy goodwyll, &amp; thys accordaūce bytwene false wyl &amp; thyne herte, in falsyte ben lykened together. Yet a ly¦tel wol I say the, in good wyll thy goodwyl∣les to rayse &amp; strength. Take hede to me ({quod} she) how thy wylles thou shalt vnderstande. Right as ye han in your body dyuers mem∣bres, and fyue sondrye wyttes, euerych apart to hys owne doyng, which thinges as instru¦mētes ye vsen, as your hādes aparte to han∣dle, fete to go, tonge to speke, eye to se: Ryght so y<SUP>e</SUP> soule hath in hym certayne sterynges &amp; strengthes whych he vseth as instrumētes to his certayne doynges. Reason is in the soule, which he vseth thīges to know &amp; to proue, &amp; wil, which he vseth to wilne: &amp; yet is neither wyl ne reason al y<SUP>e</SUP> soule, but eueryche of hem is a thing by him self in y<SUP>e</SUP> soule. And right as euerich hath thus singuler īstrumētes by hē selfe, they han as well diuers aptes &amp; dyuers maner usynges, &amp; thilke aptes mowē in wyll ben cleped affectiōs. Affectiō is an instrumēt of wyllyng in his apetites. Wherfore mokel folke sayne, if a resonable creatures soule any thing feruētly wylneth, affectuously he wyl∣neth, &amp; thus may wyl by terme of equiuocas in thre wayes be vnderstād: One is instrmēt of wyllyng, another is affectiō of thys instru¦ment: &amp; the thyrd is vse, y<SUP>t</SUP> setteth it a werke. Instrumēt of willyng is thilke strēgth of the soule, which y<SUP>e</SUP> cōstraineth to wylne, ryght as

reson is instrumēt of reasons, which ye vsen when ye loken. Affection of thys instrument is a thyng, by which ye be drawe desyrouslye any thyng to wylne in coueytous maner, all be it for the tyme out of your mynde: as yf it come in your thought thylke thyng to remē∣bre, anone ye be wylling thilke to done or els to haue. And thus is instrument wyl, &amp; affec∣tion is wyl also, to wylne thynge as I sayd: as for to wylne helth, whē wyl nothing ther∣on thiketh, for anon as it cometh to memorie it is in wyl, and so is affection to wylne slepe whē it is out of mynde, but anone as it is re∣membred wyl wylneth slepe, when his tyme cometh of y<SUP>t</SUP> doynge. For affection of wyll ne∣uer accordeth to sycknesse, ne alway to wake. Right so in a true louers affectiō of willyng instrument, is to wylne truth in hys seruyce, &amp; this affection alway abydeth, although he be sleping or thret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, or els not theron thin∣kyng, but anon as it cometh to minde, anone he is stedfast in that wil to abyde. Vse of this instrument forsoth is another thyng by hym selfe, &amp; that haue ye not but whē ye be doynge in wylled thyng by affect or instrumēt of wil purposed or desyred, &amp; this maner of vsage in my seruice wisely nedeth to be ruled frō way¦ters w<SUP>t</SUP> enuy closed, frō spekers ful of iāgelig wordes, from proude folke &amp; hautayne, that labes &amp; innocentes both scornen &amp; dyspysen. Thus in doyng varieth the actes of willing euerich from other, &amp; yet ben they cleped wil, &amp; the name of wyl vtterly owen they to haue as instrument of wyll is wyl, when ye turne into purpose of any thynge to don, be it to syt or to stande, or any suche thynge els. This in¦strument maye ben had, although affecte and vsage be lefte out of doynge, right as ye haue syght and reason, and yet alway vse ye grea∣test wysedome in hem shall he be, and they in god. Nowe then when all false folke be asha∣med, which wenen al bestialte &amp; erthly thing be swetter and better to the body, then heuēly is to the soule: thys is the grace &amp; the frute y<SUP>t</SUP> I longe haue desyred, it doth me good the sa∣uoure to smel. Christ nowe to the I crye of mercy and of grace, and graunt of thy good∣nes to euery maner reder full vnderstādynge in thys leude pamflet to haue, and let no man wene other cause in thys werke, then is vere¦ly the soth: For enuy is euer redy all innocē∣tes to shende, wherfore I wolde that good speche enuye euermore hynder. But no man wene thys werke be sufficiently maked, for goddes werke passeth mans, no mās wyt to perfit werke may by no way puruay thende: How shuld I thē so leude, ought wene of per¦fectiō any ende to get?
