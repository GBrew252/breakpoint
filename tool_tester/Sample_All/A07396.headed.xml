<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT EXCELLENT AND MOST GRATIOVSE PRINCESSE, ELI∣ZABETH BY THE GRACE OF God Quene of England, Fraunce, and Ireland, Defendour of the Faith.
(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>)</HEAD>
<P>IF THE mind of man (most gratiouse
Souuerain) in respect of vvhich vve
are made after the image of the hig∣hest,
excelled not in passing degrees,
the lumpe of mortall fleshe, by mea∣nes
vvhereof it vttereth his naturall functions, iff
the qualitees of the one surmounted not infinitly
the conditions of the other, neither should it seme
vvorthe the vvhile to set penne to paper for defen∣se
of true religion, in these perilous times of schis∣me
and heresy, neither vvould it be sitting for one
of my calling to commend such labours to the ve∣vve
of your Maiesty. For, as in the vvriting I haue
good cause to remembre that <HI>Truthe purchaseth ha∣tred,</HI>
so in the commending of the same I can not
forgett that a younge scholer, and base subiect at∣tempteth
to talke vvith a right mighty Princesse
and his lerned Souuerain. Notvvithstanding, con∣sidering
the invvarde man and better portion off
my selfe, I haue to comforte me bothe in the one,
<PB REF="3"/>
and in the other. In the one, respect of the profit
vvhich may arise hereby to the deceiued conscien∣ces
of my dere countremē, your highnes subiectes,
my regard to Gods honour and zeale to the truth
do make me lesse to feare the displeasure that may
ensue. In the other your highnes most gratiouse
Clemency, and knovven good affection to be en∣formed
of the truth, enboldeth me to present par∣ticularly
to your most Royall Maiesty, that vvhich
I publish to the vvhole Realmes commodite. For
as that vvhich the body receiueth, the Head first
vevveth and considereth, so thought I most conue∣nient,
that the generall history of the realme off
England shoulde first be commended to the prin∣cely
head and Souuerain gouuernour of the same.
Againe, the history in Latin being dedicated by
the Author to a kinge of this realme, one of your
most Noble progenitours, it semed no lesse then
duty, that the translatiō and nevv publishing of it
ought to come forth vnder your highnes protecti∣on
succeding in the Imperial Crovvne of the same.</P>
<P>The matter of the History is such, that if it may
stande vvith your Maiesties pleasure to vevve
and consider the same in vvhole or in part, your
highnes shall clerely see as vvell the misse informa∣tions
of a fevve for displacing the auncient and
right Christen faith, as also the vvay and meane of
a spedy redresse that may be had for the same, to
the quietnesse of the greater part of your Maiesties
<PB REF="3"/>
most loyal and lovvly subiectes cōsciences. In this
history it shall appeare in vvhat faith your noble
Realme vvas christened, and hath almost these
thousād yeres cōtinevved: to the glory of God, the
enriching of the crovvne, and great vvelth and qui¦et
of the realme. In this history your highnes shall
see in hovv many and vveighty pointes the pretē∣ded
refourmers of the church in your Graces do∣miniōs
haue departed frō the patern of that soun∣de
and catholike faith planted first among Engli∣shemen
by holy S. Augustin our Apostle, and his
vertuous cōpany, described truly and sincerely by
<HI>Venerable Bede,</HI> so called in all Christendom for his
passing vertues and rare lerning, the Author of this
History. And to thentent your highnes intention
bent to vveightier considerations and affaires may
spende no longe time in espying oute the parti∣culars,
I haue gathered out of the vvhole History a
number of diuersities betvvene the pretended reli∣gion
of Protestants, and the primitiue faith of the
english church, and haue annexed them streight
ioyning to this our simple preface. Maie it please
your most gracious highnes to take a short vevv of
it, and for more ample intelligence of euery parti∣cular
(if it shall so like your highnesse) to haue a re∣course
to the booke and chapter quoted.</P>
<P>Beside the vvhole history of holy and lerned S.
Bede, I haue published a short and necessary dis∣course
to mete vvith the only argument of such as
<PB REF="4"/>
vvill pronoūce this vvhole booke to be but a fard∣le
of papistry, a vvitnesse of corrupted doctrine, a
testimony of that age and time vvhich they haue
already condēned for the time of no true Christia∣nite
at all: of such I saie as haue altered the faith vve
vvere first Christened in, condemning our dere
forefathers of allmost these thousand yeares, the
Christen inhabitants of your graces dominions.
This I haue done principally in ij<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> partes. In the fir∣ste
by expresse testimonies of holy Scripture, the
psalmes, the prophets, and the nevv Testamēt, by
remouing the obiections of the aduersaries taken
out of holy Scripture, by the glorious successe of
these later 900. yeares in multiplying the faithe of
Christ through the vvorlde, last of all by clere and
euident reasons I haue proued that the faith of vs
Englishmen all these ix c. hundred yeares, coulde
not possibly be a corrupted faith, traded vp in su∣perstitions,
blindnesse, and idolatry, as it is falsely
and vvickedly surmised of many, but that it is the
true and right Christianite no lesse then the firste
vj. c. yeares, and immediat succession of the Apos∣tles.
In the second part, vvhere vve gather a num∣ber
of differences in doctrine, in ecclesiasticall go∣uernement,
in the order and maner of proceding,
in the course and cōsequēces of both religiōs, that
first plāted among vs and so many hundred yeares
cōtinevved, and this presently preached and pretē∣ded,
I haue shevved by the testimonies of the mo∣ste
<PB REF="4"/>
auncient and approued Fathers, of the Coun∣cels
and histories of that time, that in all such diffe∣rences
our faith first planted and hitherto conti∣nevved
amonge vs, agreeth and concurreth vvith
the practise and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elefe of the first vj. c. yeres, the ti∣me
approued by al mens consent for the right and
pure Christianite. If it may stande vvith your Ma∣iesties
pleasure to vveigh this double truthe so cle∣rely
proued first out of Gods holy vvorde and eui∣dent
reason, then out of the assured practise of the
primitiue churche, your Grace shall quickely see a
ready redresse of present schismes, a compendious
quieting of troubled consciences, and an open pa∣the
to returne to the faith, vvithoute vvhiche is no
saluation. As vve knovve right vvell, the mea∣ning
of your gracious highnes to be already seri∣ously
bent to haue the truthe tried and to be sin∣cerely
published throughe all your Graces do∣minions,
so to the ende that this godly zeale ma∣ie
in your Maiesties most Princely hart the more
be kindled and cōfirmed, most humbly and lovv∣ly
I beseche the same, to beholde a fevve examples
of the most puissant Princes that haue ben in
Christendom, vvhich in that singular vertu haue
principally excelled.</P>
<P>At vvhat time Princes and Emperours (hauing
certaine hundred yeares fought and striued all in
vaine against the light of the ghospel and publis∣hing
of Christen religion) beganne at length them
<PB REF="5"/>
selues to take the svvete yoke of Christe, to sub∣mit
their Sceptres to his holy Crosse, and ioyning
deuoute humilite vvith vvordly policie began to
procure their soule helth, and to prouide for the
vvorlde to come, then the prophecy of Esaie vvas
in them fullfilled saying to the churche of Christ.
<HI>Beholde I will stretche out mine hande to the gentils, and sett
vpp my token to the people.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esaiae. 49.</NOTE> <HI>They shall bringe thee thy son∣nes
in their lappes, and cary their daughters vnto thee vppon
their shoulders. For kinges shall be thy nursing Fathers,
and Quenes shall be thy nursing mothers. They shall fall
downe before thee: &amp;c et.</HI> Then their chiefe endeuour
and principall care hath ben to maintaine the only
Catholike faith in their dominions, and to chase
eftesoones all schismes and heresies that from time
to time sprange vp amonge. Constantin the great
(vvorthely so called for sondry respects) the Arri∣an
heresy vnder him arising, laboured by all mea∣nes
possible and semely to his princely vocation to
quēche the same. For this purpose, first he directed
that lerned and vertuous Father Osius bisshop of
Corduba in Spayne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. li. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. cap. 12.</NOTE> to the churches of AEgypte
vvhere the terrible tragedy of that hainous here∣sie
beganne, vvith his letters of exhortation to re∣concile
them againe vvhich vvere diuided in mat∣ters
of the faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 13.</NOTE> He vvrote also to Arrius him selfe
and Alexander the bisshop of Alexandria, persua∣ding
vvith them to come to agreement and accor∣de.
After (al this fuffising not) at the motion and
<PB REF="5"/>
order of the vertuous bishops of that time and by
their ordinary meanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In praefat. Nic. Con.</NOTE> he caused the truthe of the
controuersy to be enquired, examined, and discus∣sed
in a full and generall Councell helde at Nice,
vvhere he presented him selfe bearing the charges
of the bishops that dvvelled farre of.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nicep. lib. 8. cap. 14.</NOTE> After this co∣uncell
according to the determination of those
holy Fathers, for quieting the church, he banished
<HI>Arrius, Theognis, Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebius</HI> of Nicomedia, and other
masters of that secte. He talked also and commo∣ned
vvith <HI>Acesius</HI> a bishopp of the Nouatians, la∣bouring
to vvinne him to the Catholike church
againe. Being troubled also vvith <HI>Donatus</HI> and his
complices breding then a nevve secte in Christes
church, against Caecilianus their lavvfull bishop, he
vvrote vnto <HI>Miltiades</HI> then Pope of Rome to decide
the matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem li. 7. cap. 42.</NOTE> and directed a commission out of his
ovvne Courte for the better expedition of the sa∣me.
Thus laboured that vertuous and Christen
Emperour Constantin the great to maintaine
the vnite of Christes church, and to abolish all he∣resies
in the prouinces of the vvhole vvorld then
subiect vnto him. This glasse he lefte to his poste∣rite
other Christen Princes to looke on.</P>
<P>Valentinian the first, the next catholike Empe∣rour
of any continuaunce after Constantin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. tri∣part. libr. 8. c. 13.</NOTE> so ear∣nestly
t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>̄dred the catholike religion, that vvhen Va∣lēs
his brother the Arriā Emperour of the East, de∣maunded
aide of him against the Gotthes, then
<PB REF="6"/>
breaking in to the Romain empire, he ansvvered
that being an heretike, it could not stande vvith
his conscience and religion to helpe him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. par. 19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp;. 25.</NOTE> fearing
vvorthely the checke that God by the mouth of
Iehu gaue to Iosaphat kinge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uda, for aiding
the Apostata and Idolater Achab, kinge of Is∣raell.
Theodosius successour of Valens in the East
called also the great for his vvorthy and princely
qualities, for the maintenaunce of the catholike
faith of Christes church, published an edict a∣gainst
the Arrians and the Manichees, vvherby he
imbarred them all maner of assembles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">L. Omnes Vet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ae. cod. de he. et Manich.</NOTE> preaching
or teaching, banished thē out of cites and places of
resorte commaunding also no man should com∣pany
vvith them. Againe the same Emperour after
much disputations and conferences had vvith the
Arrians, perceauing at lenght by the aduise of <HI>Si∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius,</HI>
that they agreed not amonge them selues,
nor approued the lerned vvriters in Christes chur∣che
before their time (bothe vvhich great faultes
are euident in the principal promoters of this nevv

and for a finall extirping of schisme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates li. 5. c. 10. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zomenus lib. 1. c. 17.</NOTE> he vvith

<P>Honorius and Arcadius sonnes to Theodosius,
folovved the godly steppes of the vertuous Prince
their Father. Thereupon Arcadius by the stoute

aduise of Chrisostom vvould not graunt to <HI>Gainas</HI>

present at a general assemble in Carthage of the ca∣holike
bishops and the Donatistes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. 7.</NOTE> as it appeareth
by the conferences of that assemble yet extant in
the vvorkes of S. Augustin.</P>
<P>Hovv diligent Theodosius the second next suc∣cessour

the heresy of Nestorius, and in setting forth
the right doctrine touching the godhed of the ho∣ly
Gost against Macedonius and his scholers, the
vvritings of Cyrillus <HI>ad Reginas,</HI> and to Theodosius
him selfe do euidently declare.</P>
<P>After these Marcianus the Emperour vvith that
vertuous princesse Pulcheria laboured diligently
to extinguish the heresy of Eutyches, as it may ap∣peare
by sundry epistles of lerned Leo then Pope
of Rome solliciting eftsoones the Emperour there∣to,
and by the Actes of the fourth generall councell
of Chalcedon. VVhich not long after him Iustinus

also his successour caused al the hereticall bookes

and vvritinges of the saied Seuerus and other to be

<P>Such hath alvvaies bē (most gracious Souuerain)
the vertuous zeale of the vvisest and most politic∣ke
Princes to extirpat heresies and false religiō out
of their dominiōs, knovving right vvel, that none
are better subiects to the Prince than such as most
deuoutly serue almighty God. And again that no∣thing

as they tēdred most the setting forth of true
religiō, and abolishment of the false, so prospered
they most of al other in vvorldly respectes. For as
vnder Constantin the great first by vs mencioned
the empire most florished, and vvas thē first pla∣ced
<PB REF="7"/>
in the East, the cyte of Byzance being then ma∣gnificently
enlarged, and called Constantinople
of that most mighty Emperours name, as he had
diuers and most glorious conquestes against the

enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>copius lib. 1. 2. 3. &amp;. 4.</NOTE> so (to lett passe the other) Iusti∣nian

chasing the VVandals out of Afrike, cleering Italy
and the vvest empire of the Gotthes, extingui∣shing
vtterly the Hunnes in Graece, and hauing
most noble victories against the Persians.</P>
<P>Longe it vvere particularly to discourse vpon
the Princes of euery singular prouince in Christen∣dom,
and to notise vnto your hignes, the zeale,
diligence, and endeuour of eche one in extirping
haeresy and schismes. Yet to thentent it may appe∣are
that the one Imperiall Crovvne of Christen∣dome
being parted in to seuerall realmes and do∣minions,
the zeale of eche one in the particular

your most gracious highnes to call to remembra∣unce
that this Christen and godly zeale hath ben

<P>To the Imperiall Crovvne of your Maiesty, the
Noble and glorious title of <HI>Defender of the faith</HI> hath

of the clergy. How, after what maner, and wherefore the church
of Christ vseth it, the history disputeth and sheweth at large, in the fifte
booke the <HI>xxii.</HI> chapter, toward the ende.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="32"/> Our primitiue church was gouuerned by Synods of the clergy only,
in determining controuersies ecclesiasticall. The History declareth this
practise in the first booke, the <HI>ii.</HI> chap. the fourth booke the <HI>v.</HI> chap. the
<HI>xvii.</HI> chap. and <HI>xxviii.</HI> chap. Protestants haue called the determination
of ecclesiasticall matters from thence to the laie Courte only.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="33"/> The spirituall rulers of our primitiue church were bishops and pa∣stours
duly consecrated. It appereth in the History, the first booke the
27. chap. and the second booke the 3. chap. Protestants haue no such due
consecration, no true bishops at all.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="34"/> Protestants haue brought the supreme gouuernement of the church
to the laie authorite. In the primitiue faith of our countre the laie was
subiect to the bishop in spirituall causes, Peruse the <HI>xiii.</HI> and <HI>xxii.</HI> chap∣ters
of the third booke.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="35"/> Last of all, the finall determination of spirituall causes in our pri∣mitiue
Church rested in the See Apostolike of Rome. This practise ap∣peareth
in the second booke the <HI>iiii.</HI> the <HI>xvii.</HI> and the <HI>xx.</HI> chapters. Item
in the fifte booke the <HI>xx.</HI> chap. How farre that See is nowe detested by
<PB REF="12"/>
the sober religion of protestants, all men do see.</P>
<P>To note how differently the Catholike faith of al Christendom was
first planted in our countre, and the parted faith of protestants hathe
corrupted the same, the first difference is clere herin that our first Ca∣tholik
faith we receaued of the See of Rome. This heresy hath begon∣ne <MILESTONE N="36"/>
by first departing from that See. The Apostles of our faith came
from Rome, the messangers of these schismes beganne first by scattering
frō the See Apostolik of Rome. How we receiued our faith of Rome,
the later chapters of the first booke, and the first of the secōd do testifie.</P>
<P>Againe our faith was first preached with Crosse and procession.<MILESTONE N="37"/>
Lib. 1. cap. 25. These heresies first raged by throwing downe the Crosse,
and altering the procession therewith.</P>
<P>Our first Apostles were monkes. See the first booke, the <HI>xxiii.</HI> chap.<MILESTONE N="38"/>
and the third booke the <HI>iii.</HI> chap. The first preachers of protestants haue
ben Apostatas. Luther, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Bar∣nes,
Barlow and other.</P>
<P>The first impes off our faith, the first scholers off oure Apostles <MILESTONE N="39"/>
were holy and vertuous mē. Reade the xxvj. chap. of the third booke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In postilla magna in Dom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ad.</NOTE>
The broode of protestants in the very first issue hath ben so enormous,
that Luther the holy Father thereof confesseth his scholers to be vn∣der
him farre more wicked, then they were before vnder the Pope.</P>
<P>The first preaechers of our faith liued Apostolically in voluntary <MILESTONE N="40"/>
pouerty, as the history reporteth in the first booke the xxvj. chap. This
Apostolicall perfection, protestāts bearing thē selues for the Apostles of
England, neither practise them selues, neither can abide it in other.</P>
<P>As touching the effect and consequences of both religions, our faith <MILESTONE N="41"/>
builded vp monasteries and chirches as the history reporteth in the fir∣ste
booke the 32. chap. in the third booke, the iij. and xxxiij. chap. Itē in
the fourth booke the iij. chap. Protestants haue throwen down many, e∣rected
none.</P>
<P>By the first Christians off our faith, God was both serued day and <MILESTONE N="42"/>
night, as in the fourth booke the vij. chap. it is expressely mencioned.
Protestants haue abolished al seruice off God by night, and done to the
<PB REF="13"/>
deuill a most acceptable sacrifice.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="43"/> By the deuotion of the people first embracing our catholike faithe
much voluntary oblations were made to the church, as in the first boo∣ke
the xxvij. chap. it appeareth. By the rechelesse religion off protestants
due oblations are denied to the church.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="44"/> Princes endued the church with possessions and reuenues, moued

<HEAD>THE PREFA∣CE TO THE RE∣ADER.</HEAD>
<P>THe kingdom of heauen is compared in holy scripture
(christen Reader) to a marchant aduenturer, whiche
seking and trauailing to finde precious stones,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 13.</NOTE> hauing
at length founde out one of singular and most excel∣lēt
value, goeth and selleth al that he hath to bye that one. What
this singular and most excellent perle is, whereunto the king∣dom
of heauen is compared, if we weigh and ponder diligent∣ly,
we shall finde it to be no other thing, then the <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Chri∣ste
Iesus,</HI> whereby the kingdom of heauen is vndoubtedly pur∣chased.
This perle is of price so singular, and of value so ex∣cellent,
that to gett it we sell al that we haue, we renounce the
worlde, the fleshe and the diuell with all the pompe thereoff,
we cleaue onely to this, we professe to lyue and dye in it.
This precious pearle off <HI>Fayth,</HI> this singular iewell of true
belefe, this heauenly treasure off the right knoweleadge
off God and off his commaundements, as all nations att
one tyme receyued nott,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 14.</NOTE> God off hys secrett and right iu∣stice
sufferring the Nations to walke on their waies, but in
seuerall ages, and by seuerall meanes, as and when it pleased
God was opened and made manifest, so haue al nations not on∣ly
for that, solde all which they had, yelding and submitting
them selues only and wholly thereto, but also haue stedfastly
and assuredly cleaued vnto it, haue by longe succession preser∣ued
it, and enioyed it. If any haue in time vtterly lost this most
excellent and rare iewell (as we see, alas, all the Southe and all
most all the East part of the worlde hath) the cause thereof
hath ben the alteration, and new deuised furbishing of that per∣le
from the former and natural shape thereof, first and formest
receiued. Such nations and partes of the worlde as haue in ma∣ny
<PB REF="14"/>
ages and, do yet kepe and enioy this riche and prince∣ly
treasure, do therefore yet kepe it and enioye it bicause they
continew and remaine in it after such order and maner only,
as they receiued it: bicause they kepe it as they founde it, bicau∣se
they continue it, as they begonne it. Of the first if we re∣membre
the breaking in of the Wandals in to Afrike about the
yeare of our Lorde 400. men soone after infected with the Ar∣rian
haeresy, if we call to minde the great rage and tumult of
heresies, in the Greke Churche, Arrians, Macedonians, Eu∣tychians,
Monothelites, and a numbre of such other, if we
will truste the reporte and course of Hystories thereof, we shall
euidently see, that this inestimable iewell off the Christen
faithe hath in Afrike and Grece vtterlye ben loste, bicau∣se
they departed from the first paterne deliuered vnto them,
bicause they altered the faith first receiued amonge them,
brefely bicause they yelded to heresies. Of the later if we haue
an eye to the vniformite of the Christē faith first receiued in al
such countres as yet remaine Christians, with the faith first
planted and graffed amonge them, if we looke to Italy, to Fra∣unce,
to Spaine, to the catholike territories of Grece, of Germa∣ny,
of Suicerland, to the kingdomes of Poole, of Portugall, and
of other maine landes in other places off the worlde dispersed,
where the precious iewell of this faith is knowen and enioyed,
we shall finde that all those countres haue and do therefore yet
continew in the same, bicause they varie not from the first
faith receiued, bicause they mangle not the iewell geuen vnto
them, neither alter the naturall shape thereof, brefely bicause
they beleue al one thinge and after one sorte as their first tea∣chers
and Apostles beleued and taught them. For why? They
haue well remēbred the admonitions of S. Paule to the Corin∣thians

of a countreman of oures liuing and flourishing shortly af∣ter

<P>Touching the Author of this History, he was a countremā
of oures borne in the Northe countre, by Weimouth not farre
frō Dyrrhā.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Author of this History.</NOTE> He flourished in the yere 730. He was a mā of great
lerning and vertu, much reuerēced not only at home, but also
through out al Christendō euē in his life, time and much more
<PB N="1" REF="15"/>
after his death. Of his rare lerning and knowleadg his writin∣ges
yett extant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his lerning.</NOTE> are a clere and sufficient testimony. The pro∣testants
of Basill haue of late yeares sett forthe his whole
workes now extant, in eight tomes contayning four great vo∣lumes.
In them it appeareth that S. Bede was a man vniuer∣sally
sene in all good lerning, as well of humanite and philoso∣phie
as of diuinite, expert off the tounges, ready in holy
scriptures, perfectly conuersant in the olde fathers. He was so
great a folower of S. Augustin, the worthyest piller of the chur∣che
sence the Apostles time, that his commentaries vpon holy
Scriptures bothe of the olde and newe Testament, are allmost
worde for worde out of S. Augustin. He was so diligent a rea∣der
of that lerned Father, that whereas in the wordes of S. Au∣gustin
no perpetuall commentary vpon the epistles of S. Paule
being extant, and yet that worthy Fathers in diuers places of
his lerned workes hauing by occasion touched and expounded
euery text of those epistles, <HI>Venerable Bede</HI> for the great pro∣fit
of his posterite, as a man borne to edifie Christes Church,
hath so gathered those scattered places out of the mayne sea off
S. Augustins workes, that placing them in order and facion, he
made a iust and full commentary vpon all the epistles of S. Paul
with S. Augustins owne wordes, noting to the reader allwaies
the booke and chapter of S. Augustin, from whence he had ta∣ken
those places. This worke is intituled <HI>Collectanea Bedae.</HI> In
which worthy worke, we may doubte whom to maruaile more
at or commend. S. Augustin which had so ofte in his workes
treated of S. Paul, and omitted no one sentēce vnexpounded, or
S. Bede which so gathered into a iust commentary the sayinges
of S. Augustin, meaning no such thinge. As S. Bede was a gre∣at
writer, so he was a continuall preacher. His homelies yet ex∣tant
do testifie, made not only vpon the ghospells and epistles
of the Sondaies through out the yeare but also vpon the festi∣uall
daies of Saintes. They are to be read in the seuenth tome
<PB REF="16"/>
of his workes. These homilies of his were so highly estemed
that (as Trithemius reporteth) they were openly read in chur∣ches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. de scri. ecclesiasti.</NOTE>
while he yet lyued, through out our countre. Euen as we
reade of holy Ephrem that lerned deacon of Edessa, that his
writinges also were openly read in churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron. in Cata. vir. illust.</NOTE> next after holy
scripture. After his death they were receiued of other par∣tes
of Christendom, Fraunce especially (as Platin noteth)
and are to this daye read in principall festes with no lesse au∣thorite
and reuerence then the homilies of S. Ambrose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Ioan. 6.</NOTE> S.
Augustin, S. Gregory, and other. Briefely the whole occupation
and businesse of this lerned man was, to lerne, to teache and to
write, as in his owne wordes placed after the ende of this histo∣ry
he recordeth him selfe. Againe for the more commendation
of his lerning, it is to be remēbred what lerned scholers he had.
Amonge the rest the most famous were (as Polidore specifieth)
Rabanus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 5. Histor.</NOTE> Alcuinus, Claudius, and Ioannes Scotus, not the
scholeman but an other of S. Benets order. These were all fa∣mous
and lerned writers, as in Trithemius who hath writē their
liues the lerned may reade. Alcuinus S. Bedes scholer beinge
sent of Offa kinge of the middleenglishmen in embassage to
Charlemain the first and most glorious Emperour of the Ger∣mans,
was for his vertu and lerning retained with the Empe∣rour,
and became his scholemaster and instructer in all kinde
of good lerning. He taught after at Paris, and persuaded the
Emperour Charlemain to erect there an vniuersite: which be∣ginning
with that vertuous fountaine S. Bedes scholer and our
countre man, we see now to what a great riuer it hath multi∣plied,
and how many lerned men these vij. hundred yeares and
vpwarde haue from thence ben deriued. To returne to S. Bede,
he had two lerned brothers, <HI>Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Haymo</HI> bothe famous
writers and lightes of the church, as in Honorius, Trithemius,
Platin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Ioan. 6.</NOTE> and other ecclesiasticall writers it may be sene. And thus
much of his lerning, which who list farder to trie, he may reade
<PB N="2" REF="16"/>
his lerned workes, lately sett forth (as I saied) and much com∣mended
by the protestants thē selues of Basill. For more satis∣fying
the english reader, I will after the preface place his whole
life shortly writen by Trithemius, with the enumeration of cer∣tain
of his workes in his time knowen.</P>
<P>As touching the vertu of holy S. Bede,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his vertu.</NOTE> which properly cō∣mendeth
an historiographer, and dischargeth him from all sur∣mises
and suspicions of false reporting or poeticall fayning, yt
may be to any well meaning man a sufficient argument that e∣uen
from the age of seuen yeares (as he writeth him selfe)
he liued in cloyster and serued allmighty God day and night in
religion to the last houre of his life, which was the continua∣unce
of lxv. yeares. All which time he so attended to praier, to
daily and howrely seruing of God in the church, to priuat me∣ditations, that (as one writeth) if ye consider his life, ye would
thinke he had studied nothing, and againe if ye beholde his stu∣dy,
ye would suppose he had spent no time in praier. For his
great vertu and modesty he was in his life time called <HI>Venerable
Bede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In vitae Bedae.</NOTE> as Trithemius noteth, of whom also Platina in that sence
speaketh, saying.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Ioan. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Beda praeter graecae atque latinae linguae doctrinam
quā non mediocriter tenuit, ob religionem e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam atque modestiam Ve∣nerabilis
cognomentum adeptus est.</HI> Bede was surnamed the <HI>Ve∣nerable</HI>
for his religion and modesty: beside that he was lerned
in the Graeke and Latin tounge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1.</NOTE> Polydore alleaging Bede in
the history of oure countre, citeth him with these titles. <HI>Beda
homo Anglus, quo nihil castius, nihil melius, nihil verius, &amp; caet.</HI>
Bede an english man, then whom none more chaste, none off
more vertu, none of more truth, &amp;c. With like commendation
and reuerence he is alleaged of his lerned posterite in al ages. In
his life time not only at home with his owne countremen for
his vertu and learning he was in high estimation, and in greate
credit with the Nobilite of our countre, but also he was abro∣de
with other Christen princes (being but a monke by profes∣sion)
<PB REF="17"/>
in greate estimation and muche reuerenced. Therefore
lyke as we reade of S. Antony, S. Hierom, before his tyme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tripart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hist. lib. 1. cap. 1. In Epist.</NOTE> off
S. Bernard and other after him, all monkes and religious men,
that in their priuat celles they had yet a care of publike quyet,
and lyke counsellers of the whole worlde they moued princes
to their duty, so of holy S. Bede we reade the same. For thus
Platin reporteth of him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Ioanne vj. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Cum Africa &amp; Hispania á Sarracenis
occuparetur, Beda, qui eisdem temporibus fuit, hanc calamitatem li∣teris
ad Principes Christiani nominis scriptis, lamentatus est: quo
bellum in hostes Dei atque hominum susciperent.</HI> When Afrike and
Spayne was taken and helde of the Sarrazens, Bede which ly∣ued
in that time, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mented this calamite in letters writen to
Christen Princes, to the entent that they should make warres
against the enemies of God and men. Wherein bothe the ver∣tuous
zele and religions care of common quiet in holy S.
Bede appereth, and the authorite also whiche he hadd abrode
with other Christen princes is signified. Vnto whom also a lit∣le
before his death in familiar letters he prophecied of the great
waste of Europe and the West church, whiche soone after his
death ensued by the Sarazens. For as Afrike by their meanes
lost the faith and lacketh it yet, so Spayne off late only recoue∣red
the faith againe. Thus muche off his learning and vertu.
Other especialls of his life, as where he was borne, howe he ly∣ued
and dyed, ye maye partly reade in his lyfe written by Thri∣themius,
which we haue translated and placed a part after the
preface, partly in his own words folowing after thende of this
history.</P>
<P>The Authour of this history being a man of suche lerning
and vertu, a countreman of oures, one that writeth the history
of thinges done at home, done in his lyfe time, or in few yeares
before, the memory of them being yet fresh and newe, it shall
not nede I trust to persuade the Reader in many words to geue
credit vnto him in such thinges as he reporteth. Neither may I
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
feare to prefer his authotite before the authorite or report of a∣ny
man that now liueth. For beside his lerning and vertu, it is
to be considered that he liued in a quiet time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhy the Author of this histo∣ry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to be credited.</NOTE> before these con∣trouersies
which nowe so trouble Christendom, were moued.
He is an indifferent reporter. There is no suspicion of partes ta∣king,
no preiudice of fauouring either side, no feare of affection
or misseiudgement to be gathered vpon him. We haue good
cause to suspect the reportes of Bale, of Fox, of Beacon and su∣che
other, whiche are knowen to maintaine a faction and sin∣gular
opinion lately spronge vp, who reporte thinges passed
many hundred yeares before their daies. No such suspicion can
be made of S. Bede, who lyued aboue eight hundred yeares pa∣ste,
and reporteth the planting of Christen religion among vs
englishmen, partly by that whiche he sawe him selfe, partly by
the reporte of such who either liued at the first coming in of
Christendom to our countre them selues, or were scholers to
such<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Who also was no maintainer of any secte or faction, but
liued and died in the knowen common faith of Christendom,
which then was, and is now but one.</P>
<P>In this history therefore vewe and consider the coming in
of Christen faithe in to oure countre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the matter of the histo∣ry.</NOTE> the heauenly tydinges
brought to our Lande, the course, encrease, and multiplying
thereof. The vertuous behauiour of oure forefathers the firste
Christen englishmen. Peruse and marke the faith which they
beleued, the hope wherein they continued, the charite wherby
they wrought. Their faith taught them to submit them selues
to one supreme head in Christes church the Apostolike Pope
of Rome, Peters successour, to whom holy Scripture telleth vs
the kayes of the kingdome of heauen were geuen.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 16.</NOTE> Their faith
taught them all such thinges as are now by protestants denied,
as for the more part we haue out of the history gathered by a
numbre of differēces, placed in the second part of the Fortresse.
Their hope and charite so wrought, that our dere countre of
<PB REF="18"/>
England hath ben more enriched with places erected to Gods
honour, and to the fre maintenaunce of good lerning, then any
one countre in all Christendome beside. Gather honny lyke
bees oute of this comfortable history of oure countre, not ve∣nim
like spiders. Reade it with charitable simplicite, not with
suspicious curiosite, with vertuous charite, not with wicked
malice. As for example. The facte of Saint Gregory described
in the seconde booke the first chapter of this history reporting
how that holy man seing in Rome certain of our countremen
sette to be solde in the market, moued with their outwarde be∣auty,
beganne to pitie and lament their inward foule infidelite,
holy S. Bede writeth diligently as an argument of his greate
good zele and tendering of Christes religion, and construeth
it to the beste, as no honest Reader can other wyse do. But
baudy Bale according to the cleanes of his sprit and holy
ghospell, like a venimous spider being filthy and vncleane him
selfe sucketh out a poisonned sence and meaning, charging that
holy mā with a most outragious vice and not to be named.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sueton in Neron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> So
like an other Nero (who liuing in lewde lechery woulde not be
persuaded that any was honest,) this olde ribauld, as in other
stories he practised, maketh this history also, ministring no vn∣honest
suspicion at al, nor geuing any colour of vncleane sur∣mising,
to serue his filthy appetit and bestly humour. It will
better become the godly reader, and Christen hart to interpret
al to the best. For in dede, none can think euill of other, which
is not euill him selfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Cor. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Charite,</HI> saieth <HI>S.</HI> Paule, <HI>thinketh no euill, re∣oyseth
not of iniquite, but is delited in verite.</HI> Such charite if it had
ben in Bale and his felow protestants, we should not now haue
had so many lewde lies and malicious surmises vpon the liues
of holy men, as are to be sene in the workes of Bale, Fox, and
other.</P>
<P>In this history it shal be no losse time to peruse the lerned,
vertuous, and zelous epistles of certain Popes of Rome after
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
<HI>S.</HI> Gregory, as of Bonifacius, Honorius, Vitalianus, and other
to the kinges of our countre as wel for the encreasing of Chri∣sten
faith, as for the extirping of Pelagians heresy, for the due
obseruation of Easter, which al Christendom hetherto kepeth,
and other like matters. While ye peruse this, ye may remembre
the lewde lies and slaunderous reproches of protestants daily
preaching and writing that after <HI>S.</HI> Gregory al faith was lost,
Gods honour was trode vnder foote, all right religion was
ouerturned and that by the Popes them selues. Better to be∣stowe
idle houres in such vertuous lessons as this History ge∣ueth,
and more charitable to note the godly writinges of the
Popes here also comprised, then to prie out with baudy Bale
the euill liues of our superiours. Who were they as badde
as the Pharisees or worse, yett they are to be obeyed by the cō∣maundement
of our Sauiour in such thinges as they saie,
though not to be folowed in their doinges. Truly monaste∣ries
beinge now throwen downe, no examples of vertu and
and perfection appering in such as now preache and teach, all
remembraunce of Christen deuotion would be forgotten, if
the helpe of stories were not.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the miracles, reported in this History.</NOTE></P>
<P>As touching the manifold miracles mencioned in this hi∣story,
note the person that reporteth them, and the time they
were done in, to witt, in the primitiue church of the english na∣tion.
At the planting of a faith miracles are wrought of God by
the handes of his faithful for more euidence thereof. Good life
in such as newly receiue the faith is more feruent. Visions and
and working of miracles accompanie those as liue in such fer∣uent
goodnesse and perfection. We haue therfore rather more
cause to lament the corrupt state of our time, and the kaye col∣de
deuotion of this age, then to miscredit the perfect behauiour
of our primitiue church, and the miracles wrought therein.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tobi. 12.</NOTE>
<HI>Opera dei reuelare &amp; confiteri glorio sum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est.</HI> It is an honourable
thinge to reuele and confesse the workes of God, saieth the
<PB REF="19"/>
Angel to Tobias in holy scripture. Such therefore as wil thin∣ke
the miracles of this history here reported either vncredible,
either vnprofitable and such as might haue ben left out, truly
either they must denie the author, or enuie at Gods honour.
Such as denie the author we wil not force thē to beleue him. We
make it not a matter of such necessite or importauuce. Yet this
I thinke I may be bold to require them that they beleue as farre
S. Bede, as they do the Actes and monuments of Fox, the sto∣rie
of Bale, and such other. I thinke it no sinne to matche
Venerable Bede with any of them in any respect either off ler∣ning,
honesty or truthe. It may rather sauour of sinne or at lest
off wronge iudgement, and great partialite to beleue Bale and
discredit Bede: the one being notoriously bent to one side, the
other without al suspiciō off fauouring any side: the one a late
knowen naughty man, the other a confessed holy man of al the
Latin church. Last of al the one thought lerned only off a few,
the other accompted for excellently lerned euen of the prote∣stants
them selues, namely those of Basil, who haue most dili∣gently
and with much commendation published his workes.
But I may seme to do iniury to that holy man, to cōpare him
with any of our da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, glory he neuer so much of the sprit or off
the ghospell. To returne therefore to the matter no indifferent
Reader hath any cause to discredit the miracles reported in this
History, if he will haue an eie to the person that writeth, and
to the time in which they were wrought. Nay rather it is
no small argument for the confirmation of our Catholike
faith, planted amonge vs englishmen, that at the planting ther∣of
such miracles were wrought. Of this argument in the
second part of the Fortresse we haue treated more at large.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 3. That the History ought not to se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> To

<P>If otherwise the History for the often miracles here re∣peted,

<PB N="5" REF="19"/>
which foloweth: First generally in an ecclesiasticall history,
in a history writen off the Churche, in the Historicall narra∣tion
of matters pertaining to God, to faith, and to religion, it
hath euer so fallen out in all Christen writers, that of miracles
much and often mencion hath ben made. Who so peruseth the
ecclesiasticall histories of Eusebius Pamphilus and of Ruffinus,
the tripartit history of Socrates, Sozomenus and Theodoret,
the history of Euagrius and Nicephorus, he shall finde in them
straunge and miraculous matters in the liues of holy mē repor∣ted.
For example of such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Li. 6. c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 9</NOTE> Eusebius reporteth of Narcissus a ho∣ly
man that light lacking in the church all the oyle of the lam∣pes
being spente, he made by praierwell water to serue in stede
of oyle, and the lampe light to burne by that. Also of the same
man he writeth that whereas three men had periured them
selues in an accusation against him, eche one wishing to him
selfe diuerse plages and vengeaunce from God if their accusa∣tion
was false, eche one had soone after the plage that he wished
falling vpon him euidently and miraculously.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Li. 7. ca. 18</NOTE> The same writer
reporteth of an herbe growing before an image of our Sauiour
in Caesarea of Phaenicia, where also an other image standeth of
the woman cured by Christ of the bluddy flixe, which herbe
after that by groweth it toucheth the brasen hemme of the
Images garment, it cureth deseases of all sorte. Ruffinus in like
maner in his ecclesiasticall history reporteth miraculous things
of Spiridion the holy bishop of Tremithunt in Cypres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. c. 5.</NOTE> as
that when certain theues would haue stolen of his shepe, and
came to the folde in the night time for that purpose, he found
them in the morning fast bounde without<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any man to binde

He loosed them by his worde, which before had bound them

Spiridion the holy bishop not being able otherwise to fin∣de

lay, and called her by her name. Who straight answering
him: he asked her where she had laied the pleadg of such a man

therein. Athanasius wrote the life of S. Antony the Abbat:
and so much commendeth the knowleadg thereof, that in the
preface he saieth: <HI>Perfectaest ad virtutem via Antonium scire quid
fuerit.</HI> It is a perfect waie to vertu, to know what a man Antony
was: Gregory bishop of Nissa, brother to S. Basill, wrote the li∣ues
of holy Ephrem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. 3.</NOTE> and Theodorus the Martyr. <HI>S.</HI> Hierom
wrote the liues of Paulus, Hilarion, and Antony monkes. <HI>S.</HI>

Pelagia, all Martyrs and virgins of Christes church. Eusebius
Emissenus wrote the liues of Genesius, Epiphodius, Alexan∣der
Martyrs of Christes church also. Prudentius wrote in verse
the liues and miracles of many Saints.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In hom. so. 126.</NOTE> Theodoret that lerned

<HI>Philotheus,</HI> whereof he maketh oftē mention in his ecclesiastical

off Saint Martine. Saint Augustine in his bookes <HI>De ciui∣Dei,</HI>
among other arguments and tokens of the Christen faith
reakoneth vp in a sette chapter sondry miracles wrought at the
toumbes and relikes of holy Martyrs, especially of <HI>S.</HI> Steuen.
Brefely, if we will haue an eye to holy scripture it selfe, we fin∣de
in the foure euangelistes beside the heauenly doctrine, besi∣de
the tydinges of our saluation, beside the mysteries of oure
redemption, the miracles also wrought by our Sauiour moste
diligently expressed, and of the three which first wrote parti∣cularly
repeted: we finde in in the Actes of the Apostles, many
miraculous cures, and expulsions of wicked spirits wrought by
the Apostles. In the bookes of the kinges likewise manifolde
miracles and thinges (otherwise vncredib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e) are reported to be
done by Elias and Heliseus the prophets. To conclude there∣fore,
this present history of Venerable Bede, this history of the
church of England (our dere countre) containing in it beside
the historical narratiō of the coming in of vs englishmen into
<PB REF="21"/>
this lande, and of attaining to the faith off Christ in the same
manifold miracles, and particular liues of holy men, as of saint
Augustin, Paulinus, Mellitus and other our first Apostles, off
lerned Theodoret and Wilfrid, of the holy bishops Aidan of
Scotland, <HI>S.</HI> Cutbert, <HI>S.</HI> Iohn of Beuerlake, S. Chadde, <HI>S.</HI> Er∣kenwald
of England, of <HI>S.</HI> Oswald, of <HI>S.</HI> Audery and diuers o∣ther
religious virgins, in the very springe and first frutes of our
Christen faith, ought not to any Christen man seme a vaine,
fabulous, or incredible narration, more then the histories of o∣ther
Saintes liues no lesse miraculous and different from the
common trade of men (especially in the lewde loose liberty of
this wicked time) than are the liues and doinges mentioned in
this history, ought to seme: being yet writen of the most ler∣ned
fathers in Christes church aboue named, and in the purest
time of Christianite, by the aduersaries owne confession, to
witt: all within the compasse off the first V. C. yeares. And as
Theodoret in the preface of his <HI>Philotheus</HI> warneth the Chri∣sten
Readers not to discredit any thinge by him to be mentio∣ned
in that history of saintes liues, so will I with his wordes,
warne the studious Reader hereof, such as esteme the iudge∣ment
of the holy and lerned Fathers. Theodoret saieth, and
I in the name of Venerable Bede saie the same.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In praefat. ad Philo∣theum.</NOTE> <HI>Eos qui in huius
historiae lectionem inciderint, oro atque obsecro &amp;c,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An admo¦nition out of Theo∣doret tou∣ching mi∣racles.</NOTE> Those whiche
shall happen to reade this history (saieth Theodoret) I praye
and beseche that if they finde any thing writen, which passeth
their power, they do yet beleue it, not measuring the vertu and
power of holy men, with their owne vertu or power. For
God geueth giftes of the holy Ghoste to the godly, and more
excellent to such as excell in godlynes. And this I speake to
them which are not acquainted with the secret works of God.
For suche as haue wel serched and tried the secrets of the holy
Ghost, they knowe and feele his bountifulnes, and do wel vn∣derstand
what God among men worketh by mē, when by the
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
mighty power of miracles he draweth the vnbeleuers to the
knowleadg of him. Truly whosoeuer will sticke to credit such
thinges as we shal report, no doubt but he will also sticke and
stagger, to beleue the miraculous workes of Moyses, of Iosue,
of Elias and of Elizeus. Yea the miraculous workes of the A∣postles,
he will accompt for very fables. Otherwise, if he wil
beleue those other thinges to be al true, why wil he mistrust
these for false? For the same grace of god which wrought in the
other, hath also wrought in these holy men all such thinges as
they did. For this grace being continual and euer running, ten∣dring
alwaies such as make them selues worthy thereof, by su∣che
men, as by certain riuers, kepeth her mayne course, and flo∣weth
most plentifully. Thus farre Theodoret.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An other out of S. Augustin.</NOTE> For in dede, as
S. Augustin saieth serching out the reason how we that liue are
visited of holy men departed this worlde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cu∣ra pro mor tuis gerēda cap. 16.</NOTE> <HI>A lij sunt huma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arum

&amp; miraculis natura non desit.</HI> The bondes of mans abilite, and
the signes off Gods power be diuerse. Some thinges are done
naturally, some miraculously: though yet bothe God helpeth
nature, and nature concurreth in miracles. And therefore S.
Augustin though (being yet so excellently lerned) he could by
no reason finde out how holy men departed this worlde mira∣culously
worke here on earth (as in the same place he expresse∣ly
confesseth) yet he reporting how that Iohn that holy Mon∣ke
appeared in a vision by night to a godly woman feruently
desiring to see and talke with him, and how he heard it by the
mouth of one which lerned it of the party her selfe, and of her
husband, he saieth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Qui hoc ab eis comperit, retulit mihi vir grauis,
&amp; nohilis, &amp; dignissimus, credidi.</HI> One which vnderstode this
of the parties them selues, reported it vnto me, a sober man
a worshipful, and worthy of credit, I beleued him. But (saieth
<HI>S.</HI> Augustin in the wordes immediatly folowing) if I had se∣ne
<PB REF="22"/>
that holy Monke my selfe, bicause, as they saie, he was both
very gentle to be asked, and very wise to make answer, I would
haue asked of him (touching this matter) whither he him selfe
came to that woman in his sleape, that is, his goste in the shape
of his body, as we also do dreame in our bodies, or whither he
him self being otherwise occupied, or if he sleapt, dreaming so∣me
other thinge, such a vision yet of him appeared to the wo∣mā
in her dreame, either by an Angel, or by som other meanes,
and that by the spirit of prophecy he foreknew all this, and the∣refore
promised before to her husbande that he woulde see her.
For iff he hym selfe was present to the woman in her drea∣me,
truly that was done by miraculous grace not by na∣ture,
by the ghifte off God, not by his owne power. But iff
he being otherwise occupied, or sleaping hym selfe, and occu∣pied
with other phantasies, yet the woman sawe hym in her
sleape, truly then it semeth not much vnlike to that we
reade in the Actes of the Apostles, where our Sauiour speaketh
to Ananias of Saul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 9.</NOTE> and telleth him, that Saule did see Ananias
coming toward him, Ananias him self not knowing any thing
thereof. Which so euer of all these that man of God should an∣swer
vnto me, I would farder yet aske him touching the Mar∣tyrs,
whither they them selues be present in visions, or by some
other meanes do appeare to such as see thē in what forme they
list, and specially whē the deuils in mēs bodies cōfesse that they
are tormented of them, and desire them to spare them, or whi∣ther
all these thinges be done at the will of God by the Angeli∣call
powres for the honour and commendation of Saints, and
for the profitt of men, the martyrs them selues being in the me∣ane,
in most perfect quiett, occupied with more excellent sigh∣tes
seuerally from vs and praying so for vs. For at Millain also
at the toumes of the holy Martyrs Protasius and Geruasius, the
deuills naming them, as also other departed men, confessed also
bishop A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. brose then liuing, and cried vpon him to spare them,
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
the bishop then being otherwise occupied, and not knowing at
all thereof. Last of al whither these thinges be some times done
by the very presence of the Martyrs, sometime by the ministe∣ry
of Angels, and then whither it may be discerned of vs, and by
what tokens we may discerne it, or whither none els can dis∣cerne
it, but such as hath that gift by the Spirit of God diuiding
peculiarly to euery one as he willeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 12.</NOTE> Al these thinges, I thinke,
this Iohn would discusse and declare vnto me: that either at his
teaching I might lerne and knowe such thinges to be true and
certain, or els I might beleue without knowleadge, he teaching
yet such thinges as he knew. But if perhaps he would answere
to all these my doubtes out of holy scripture, and saie vnto me.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 3.</NOTE>
Seke not such things as passe your capacite, nor serche not after
that which excelleth your abilite, but what our Lorde hath cō∣maunded
you, thinke vpō those thinges allwaies, I should glad∣ly
take this answer also.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> <HI>Non enim paruus est fructus, si aliqua
obscura &amp; incerta quae comprehendere non valemus, clarum certum∣que
sit nobis non esse quoerenda, &amp; quod vnusquisque vult discere,
putans prodesse si sciat, discat non obesse si nesciat.</HI> For it is no small
profitt, if in such darke and doubtefull matters as by reason we
can not finde, yet we may clerely and euidently see that such
thinges are not by reason to be founde. And that euery one de∣sirous
to knowe, thinking such knowleadge might profitt him,
may lerne it is nedelesse to knowe, which he can not possi∣bly
knowe. Thus farre S. Augustin in that place, beleuing the
miraculous operations of holy Martyrs, and visions of holy
men, though he could not attaine to the reason of either other.
In like maner he beleueth that S. Felix the holy Confessour off
Nola,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. eodem Cap. 16.</NOTE> when that cyte was greuously assieged, <HI>non solis beneficio∣rum
effectibus, verum etiam ipsis hominum aspectibus apparuisse,</HI>
not only by miraculous workes and present succour, but by e∣uident
vision and common sight appeared vnto men. Such vi∣sions
such miracles holy and lerned men sticke not to beleue,
<PB REF="23"/>
though the reason therof they perce not vnto. And euen so such
holy and miraculous examples as abund in this History, though
they can not perhaps sinke in to the hartes of protestāts, whose
faith is limited by reason, and builded vpon wordly witt, yet
Catholikes which haue lerned of S. Paule <HI>to subdue their vnder∣standing
to the obedience of faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 10.</NOTE> and whose faith is guided by <HI>Cha∣rite
which beleueth all thinges,</HI> as the Apostle also teacheth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 13.</NOTE> can
easely beleue the report of so holy and lerned a man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heretikes will not beleue mi¦racles.</NOTE> as <HI>Venerable
Bede</HI> in all Christendom hath these many hundred yeares ben
accompted. Let protestants folowe the Arrians, which when a
blinde man was restored to sight at the toumes of S. Geruasius
and Protasius at Millain S. Ambrose then being bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confes. lib.</NOTE> and S.
Augustin not yet christened being then present also, saied yet
(as S. Ambrose writeth of them) <HI>Non sunt isti martyres, nec tor∣quere
diabolum possunt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Serm. 91.</NOTE> <HI>nec aliquem liberare.</HI> These are no Mar∣tyrs,
they can not torment the deuill, they can not helpe men.
And againe. <HI>Ariani dicunt. Non sunt daemonum vera tormenta,
sed ficta &amp; composita ludibria.</HI> The Arrians do saie. These are not
true torments of the deuills, but fayned and imagined illusions.
Let protestants folow their forefathers, olde cursed heretikes,
let them scoffe at the miracles done at the toume of S. Alban
that holy Martyr, and of S. Cutbert that holy Confessour. We
will with Theodoret, with S. Augustin and with S. Ambrose
beleue such vertu and miraculous power of holy Martyrs and
Confessours mentioned by <HI>Venerable Bede,</HI> as they beleued the
report of good men, before them.</P>
<P>For the farder contentation of the Reader in this pointe,
beside all whiche hath ben saied, we shall in the history it selfe,
when straunge and vncredible miracles and visions shal oc∣curre,
note in the margin other lyke examples auouched by
the most approued writers of the primitiue churche. To make
an ende, if all this suffiseth not to defende this history from the
cauilles of protestants, bicause of the miracles here repor∣ted
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
then let them shewe a reason why the Actes and Monu∣ments
of M. Fox, deserue not the lyke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Protestāts pretende miracles.</NOTE> Are there not also in
that donghell heaped a number of miserable miracles to sette
forth the glory of their stinking Martyrs? I report me to the

miracles such as they be, are to be foūd. And to speake somwhat
particularly, he that in this history will discredit such miracles
as S. Bede reporteth vpō report of one brother or sister, let him
geue a reason why he beleueth the tale of Elyzabeth Lawnson
and Symō Harlston.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 1677.</NOTE> Who mistrusteth miracles reported vpon

seme incredible that the bodyes of dead men may remaine vn∣corrupted
and sounde, why is it tolde for a miracle that the

the body being burned vp? If visions appearing to some, not to
al that are present seme fabulous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 355.</NOTE> let it be a fable (as in dede it is,
being thereof eye witnesse my selfe) that he telleth of Latimers
hart bloud, when he suffred in Oxford. Iff the Crosse of saint
Oswalde seme a superstitious tale, how much more fonde and
fabulous is the tale of one that suffred at Bramford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa, 1670.</NOTE> with a gre∣ate
white crosse, appearing in his brest? Thus if we may cōpa∣re
truth with falshood, light with darknes, true miracles with
light tales, we see as much vncredibilite, if we looke to reason,
as great vanite in respect of the matter it self, in the one as in the
other. But how farre more credit this auncient history of Ve∣nerable
Bede deserueth then the liyng libels of vpstert secta∣ries,
it shal (as I haue already saied) easely appeare, if we consider
but the Authour of this history, and the time that he wrote in.
Whereof we haue spoken at large before. One thinge remai∣neth,
which being saied. I shall haue finished. Concerning the
proper names of places, as of cyties and monasteries mencio∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
in the history, we haue many tymes kept the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n or rather
<PB REF="24"/>
Saxon names: where Polydore and other instructions coude
not helpe vs to call them by their present names they now be∣are.
Wherein we desire the gentle Reader the rather to beare
with vs, considering that this translation being penned on this
side of the seas, we coulde not being out of the countre, haue
such speciall intelligence of eche shere and Countie as to that
purpose was requisit, and as we might perhaps easely hadd, yff
we had ben at home, and trauailed the countre our selues. Not∣withstanding
as touching the sheres, principall cytes, and di∣ners
monasteries, by the helpe of Polidore we haue termed
them, as they are now called. Whereby the whole course of the
history shall be euery where perspicuous and euident, thoughe
some certaine small monasteries and villages remaine vnkno∣wen.
How so euer it be, the principall intente bothe of <HI>Venera∣ble
Bede</HI> and of vs being the honour of God, the publishing off
our first Christen faith, the course and proceding thereof, we
haue chosen rather to sett forth the history in some part barba∣rous
thē to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nceale frō our dere countre (in these necessary ti∣mes
of instruction) the precious treasure of our Christē belefe,
wherein we were first baptised, and haue so many hundred ye∣ares
in such quiet and felicite continued. Trusting verely in al∣mighty
God that the perusing hereof, with the Fortresse and
defence of our faith, presently also set forth, may staie the con∣science
of some from daungerous deceites of this later religion
so directly and in so many pointes repugning the other. Which
if it may please the goodnesse of God to worke in the hart of
any one of my dere countremen, I shall thinke all my labour
happely bestowed, and my simple paines abundantly rewar∣ded.
In the meane we haue declared our good wil, and done in

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HO∣NORABLE KING CEOLVL∣PHE BEDA THE SERAVNT of Christe and Priest.</HEAD>
<P>THE History of thinges don in the church of
the Englishe nation which of late I had set
fourth, I did both first very gladly send your
grace desiring then to haue a sight and proufe
therof, and now againe do send it you, to the
entent you may both coppy it out, and more fully at your le∣sure
consider it. I can not but highly commend this yower ze∣le
and good desyre you haue not only to geue good eare to the
holyscriptures, but also to know of things both don and spokē
by worthy men before your time, and specially of our owne
country. For whither an history containeth good thinges don
by good men, the wise hearer is therby prouoked to wel doing:
ether reporteth euill things don by euil men, the vertuous and
wel disposed reader neuerthelesse is moued therby both to flye
that is euill and noisom to his soule, and embrace the thinge
he knoweth to be good and acceptable vnto God. Which thing
you wisely pondering, desire to haue the sayd history published
both to the instruction of your selfe, and also to the edifieng of
such other whom God hath committed vnto your gouernan∣ce.
And to thentent I may put both your grace and all other
that shall heare or reade it, out of all doubt of the verite of the
sayd History, I will briefly shew you what authours I haue
chiefely folowed in the making therof. The chiefest authour
and aider I had in compiling this worke, was the right reuerent
abbat <HI>Albinus,</HI> a mā of great learning, which being brought vp
in the church of Canterbury vnder <HI>Theodorus</HI> Archebishop of
blessed memory, and <HI>Adrianus</HI> abbat, both mē of great worship
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>
and learning, hath procured and sent vnto me al such thinges as
wer don by Saint Gregory the Popes disciples, ether in the pro∣uince
of kēt, ether other places adioyning and bordering vpon
the same. Which thinges the said Abbate hath learned partly by
writinges partly also by tradition of elders, and such things as
he hath in such sorte learned, he hath sent vnto me by the han∣des
of <HI>Nothelmus</HI> priest of the church of Londō, to be receiued
ether in writting ether by mouth and relatiō of the said <HI>Nothel∣mus.</HI>
Which also going after vnto Rome was permitted by Gre∣gorie
bishop, which is now head of that church, to search the
closettes of the saied holy church of Rome, where he founde
out certaine epistles of saint Gregorie and other bishops there,
and at his returne hath deliuered vnto vs the sayd epistles to be
put in to our history with the counsell and aduise of the reue∣rent
father <HI>Albine</HI> aboue mencioned. So that from the begin∣ning
of this booke vnto the time that the countrye of England
receiued the faith of Christe, we learned such thinges as we
bring, gathered out of the workes of such as had wrote thereof
before our time. And from thence vnto this present such thin∣ges
as hath ben don in the church and diocese of Canterbury
by the disciples of Saint Gregory or their successors, or vnder
what kinge they haue ben done, we haue knowen by the
industrie of the sayd Abbate Albine, at the reporte of <HI>Nothel∣mus,</HI>
who also hath brought me in sum parte of knowledge of
such things as wer don in the prouinces of the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Essex.</NOTE> east and<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Salis∣bury. Exceter VVelles.</NOTE> west
saxons, and also of the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Suf∣folck, Norfolck and Cam∣brigd she∣re.</NOTE> east english and of the Northūbers that
is to wit, by what bishops preaching, and vnder what king
ech of the said prouinces wer conuerted vnto the faith of Christ.
And to be shorte, by the exhortation of the sayd Albine, I was
chiefly prouoked and enboldened to set vpō this enterprise.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nort∣humbers are called in this stistory al. that dwel beyōd the riuer Hū∣bre North ward.</NOTE> Da¦niel
also the most reuerent bishop of the west saxons, which is

history both of his prouince of the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Sussex and Hap∣shere.</NOTE> South Saxōs, and of

died, we haue diligently lerned of the brothers of the mona∣stery
of <HI>Laestinge</HI> by them erected. Again of things don apper∣taining
to the church in the prouince of the easte english we
haue found out partly by monuments of writting and tra∣ditions
of the foreliuers, and partly, by the information of the
reuerend Abbot <HI>Esius.</HI> As for such things as wer don in the ter∣ritory
of <HI>Lindissig</HI> (that is holy Ilond) touching the furderance
of the faith of Christ, and what priests there succeded from ti∣me
to time, we haue learned ether by the writinges of the reue∣rent
bishop <HI>Cynebertus,</HI> ether by the liuely voice of other men
of good creditt. The history of the prouince of the Northum∣bers
from the time they receiued the faith of Christ vnto
this present, we haue gotten not by any one author, but by
relation of many faithful witnesses which might know and re∣mēber
the same beside such things as by my owne experience I
knew. Among which you shal note, that such thinges as I haue
wrote of the most holy father and bishop <HI>Cutbert</HI> ether in this
book ether in the treatice that I haue made of his life, I haue ta∣kē
partly out of those things which I found befor writē of him
by the brothers of the church of<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">The co∣untre of Northū∣berland properly.</NOTE> <HI>Lindisfarnū</HI> folowing sim∣plely
the faith of the history which I read, and partely also ha∣ue
added thereunto such things as I could learne my selfe by
the faithful testimony of such as knew him. I humbly beseche
the Reader, that if he shal finde any thing otherwise then truth
in this treatise, he wil not impute it vnto me, as the which hath
endeuoured to put in writing to the instruction of our after∣commers
such thinges as we could gather by common report,
which is the true lawe of an history.</P>

<P>BRitāny an Iland of the Oceane, which of owld
time was called Albion, doth stande betwext
the north and the west, right ouer against Ger∣many,
Fraunce, and Spayne, iij of the greatest
countries of Europe. Which being eight hun∣dred
myles longe Northward, is but ij hundred
myles broade, excepte yow reckon the cabes or poyntes of the
mountaynes which runneth owt a long far into the sea, wherby
the Iland is in cumpasse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That is 1800. mi∣les.</NOTE> <HI>forty and eight times lxxv myles.</HI> Of the
sowth side it hath Flaunders, the first hauen towne wherof to ar∣riue

hauen whereof is now corruptely called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This hauen is now loste by the ir∣ruption of the sea.</NOTE> <HI>Reptacester</HI> 50 myles of
from Calleis, or as some write 60. myles. On the back syde of it
where it lyeth open vnto the mayne Oceane, it hath the Iles cal∣led
<HI>Orcades.</HI> It is an Iland very batfull of corne, frute and pasture.
In sum places it beareth vines, it hath plentif of fowles of diuer∣se
sortes, both by sea and by land, of sprynges also and riuers full
of fysh but specially of lampriles and eles. Ther be many times
also takē porposes, Dolphyns and whales, beside many kynde
of shellfishes, among other of muskles, in whom be founde per∣les
of all coulours as red, purple, crymson, but specially white:
ther is also great store of cockles, whereof is made the dye of
crymson, whose rudd will be appalled nether with heate of sonne
nether with wette of wether, but the oulder it is, the more bright
and beutifull glasse it casteth. It hath also sprynges fitt to make
<PB REF="28"/>
salt, and others of whott waters, where ar buylded seuerall pla∣ces
meete for all ages as well for men as women to bathe them
selues. For the water (as saynt Basill writeth) runnyng thowrogh
certayne metalles, receiueth therof such vertue of heate, that it is
not only made warme therby but also skalding whot. This Iland
is stored wyth mynes of sundry metalles, as of brasse, lead, iron,
and syluer. It bringeth furth also great plētyf of the Geate stone,
and that of the best. This stone is blacke and burneth being put to
the fire, and then is of vertu good to chase away serpentes. If you
rub him till he be warme, he holdeth fast such thinges as ar layd
vnto him euen as Aumber doth. This Iland had in it sumtimes
xxviij fayre cities, beside an innumerable sort of castles whiche
also wer well and strongly fensyd wyth walles, turrettes, gates,
and bullwarkes. And for as much as it is placed right in manner
vnder the north pole, it hath light nightes in the sommer, so that
at mydnight many times men dowteth whether it be yet twy∣light
of the euening past, or breach of the day followyng. Wher∣by
the daies be of a great length there in sommer, as contrary the
nighte in wynter that is to wytt, xviij howers, by reason the son∣ne
there is so farre gō sowthward. And so in like maner the nigh∣tes
in the sommer ar there very shorte and the daies in the wyn∣ter
that is to wytt vj. equinoctiall howers, where as in <HI>Armenia,
Macedonia, Italia,</HI> and other countries subiect to the same line,
the longest day or night passeth not xv, the shortest ix howers.
This Iland at this present to the number of the v. bookes of Mo∣ses,
wyth v. sundry languages doth study and set furth the know∣ledge
of one perfecte truth, that is, wyth the language of the En∣glish,
the Britannes, the Scotts, the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Redshan∣kes.</NOTE> Pictes, and the latine, which
by study of the scriptures is made common to all the rest. At the
first this land was inhabited of none other nation but only of
the Britānes, of whom it receiueth his name: which Britānes co∣myng
out of <HI>Armorica</HI> (called now litle Britāny) as it is thought,
chose vnto them selues the sowth parte of this land. And after
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>
when they from the sowth forward had in their possession a
great parte of the Ile, it chaūced that certaine people of the Pic∣tes
coming owt of Scythia, as it is sayd, trauailing vppō the seas
with a few long shippes, the winde dryuing them in cumpasse
rownde about the coaste of Britannye, blewe them a land on
Irelands syde, on the north partes therof. Which they finding
inhabited of the Scottes, besought thē to allow them some part
of the land, where they might plante them selues. But they coul∣de
not obtayne their desire. This Ireland, next vnto Britanny is
the greatest lland of the Oceane sea, and standeth westward of
Britanny. But as Northward it is not so longe as it, so westward
it is much longer, and reacheth vnto the North partes of Spay∣ne,
hauing the mayne sea runnyng betwext. The Pictes (as I
haue sayd) arriuing wyth their nauy in Ireland, required of the
inhabitants, that they might be suffered, there to rest and place
them selues. The Scottes aunsered that the Iland was not bigg
inowgh to hold them both. But we can geue you good coun∣sel
(quoth they) what we thynke best for you to doe. We
know well there is an other Iland not farre from oures stan∣ding
easte ward from hence, which we may see owt of this land
in a fayer sonnye day. If you will goe thether, you may inhabit
ther at will. And if there be any resistance made against you, we
wil ayde you. Whervpon the Pictes arriuing in Britanny plan∣ted
them selues in the North partes therof. For as for the sowth
partes the Britānes had taken vpp before. And wheras the Pictes
hauing no wyues did require of the Scottes to marry their
dawghters, the Skottes agreed to graunt them their bone, vnder
condition, that as often as the matter was in dowt, they should
choose their kyng rather of the next of the howse of the woman
then of the man. Which order, it is well knowen the Pictes
kepeth euen to this day. In processe of yeres, after the Britās and
the Pictes, the Skottes also wer receiued in to Britanny amōg the
Pictes. Which coming owt of Ireland vnder Rewda their Ca∣pitaine,
<PB REF="29"/>
either by force or frendship, entered and inhabited the
country in Scotland, which they possessed. Of which capitaine
euen vnto this day they ar callid <HI>dall reudini,</HI> for in their langua∣ge
dall signifieth part.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A descri∣ption of Ireland.</NOTE> <HI>Irelande</HI> both in bredth, holsomnes and
fines of ayre, for passeth Britanny, so that there snow remayneth
skant iij. dayse to gether: and no man there for foddering of his
beastes, ether maketh hay in the sommer, or buyldeth stawles for
his cattaile. There is no noysom creping beast to be sene there,
no serpent that can liue there. For many times serpentes which
hath ben brought thether owt of Britanny, the ship drawing ne∣re
vnto the land, as sone as they ar towched wyth the smell of
the ayer, they dieth owt of hand. Yea more then that, all thing in
maner that cometh from the sayd Iland, is of souerayne vertue
against poyson. And this we sawe with oure eyes, that whē cer∣tain
men, that wer stinged of venemous serpents, had taken the
scraping of certaine leaues of bookes which had bē of Irelād, and
had drōke it in water, forthwyth all the force of the venim was
staynched, and the swelling of the stinged bodies vtterly asswa∣ged.
This Iland is rich in milk and hony, nor voyd of vines, fish
or foule, and full of stagges. This is properly the country of the
Skottes, owt of the which they isshuing hath inhabited Britāny
being before possessed of the Britons and the Pictes. Ther is a
great creke of the sea whiche seuered of ould time the Britons
from the Pictes, which from the west runneth far in to the lād.
Where vnto this day there is a citty of the Britons very stronge
and well fensed called <HI>Alcuith.</HI> At the north side of the which
creke, the Scottes hath come and made their dwelling country.</P>

wyth a contrary tempest was fayne to returne in to Fraunce
wyth the losse of a great part of his nauy, and no small number

And so for that wynter he was forced to dimisse his army: which

either one vppon the other, either vppon the quick sandes, and

<L>Bringeth furth Albane a Martyr right worthy.</L>
<P>This Albane being yet but a Pagane, when the cruell com∣maundements
of the wicked Princes were set forth against
the Christians, receiued in to his house one of the clergy whi∣che
had fled from the persecutours: whom he perceiuing bothe
night and day to continewe in praying and watching, beinge
sodaynly towched with the grace of God, began to follow the
example of his faith and vertu, and by litle and litle instructed
by his holesom exhortations, forsaking his blind idolatry beca∣me
Christiā with his hole hart. At length after the sayd person
of the clergy had certain daise taried with him, it came to the
eares of the Prince, that this holy confessor of Christ (whose ti∣me
was not yet come that god appointed for him to suffer mar∣tyrdome)
lay hid in <HI>Albanus</HI> house. Whereuppon he commaū∣did
his souldiours to search his house with all diligence. Whe∣ther
<PB REF="32"/>
when they were cum, saynt Albane apparelled in his gests
and masters garments offerid him selfe to the souldiours, and
so was brought bound vnto the iudge. It chaunced that the
iudge the same time, was doing sacrifice vnto the deuills before
the aultars. And when he had sene Albane, being all chaufed
with anger for that he feared not voluntarily to offer him selfe
vnto the souldiars and perell of death, for his geste, whom he
had harbored, he commaunded him to be brought before the
idoles of the diuells, before whom he there stode. And for so
much (quoth he) as thou haddest rather to conueye awaye the
rebell and traytour to our Gods, then deliuer him vp vnto the
souldiours that he might sustaine due punishement for his
blasphemous despising of the Gods, looke what paynes he
should haue suffered if he had ben taken, the same shalt thou
suffer, if thou refuse to practise the rites of ower religion. But
Saynt Albane which wilfully had before discouered him selfe
to be a Christian, litle heeded the menacies of the Prince. But
being thorouly fensed with spirituall armour of grace, told
him plainly to his face, that he would not obey his cōmaunde∣mēt.
Then said the iudge, of what house or stock art thou? Al∣bane
aunswered<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what is that to the of what house I am? but
if thou be desirous to know of what religion I am, be it kno∣wen
vnto the that I am a Christian, and that I employe my
selfe to Christian maners and excercises. Then the iudge de∣maunded
him his name. My parents (quoth he) nameth me
Albane: and I honor and worship the true and liuing god whi∣che
made al thing of naught. Thē the iudge being very wroth
sayde. If thou wilt enioy long life, cum of, and do sacrifice vn∣to
the great goddes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mar∣tyrdom of saint Alba¦ne the fir∣ste Mar∣tyr of Bri∣tanny.</NOTE> Albane aunswered, theis sacrifices whiche
yow offer vp vnto the diuells, neither helpe the offerers nor
obtaine them their desires, but rather purchase them for their
reward eternall paynes in hell fire. The iudge hearing this
being in a rage, commaunded the holy confessor of God to be
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
all beaten of the tormentours, thinking his constance would
relent at strypes, which refused to yeld to words: but he shewed
him self not only patient, but also ioyful in the middle of all his
torments. The iudge when he sawe he could be nether won∣ne
with wordes, nor tourned with torments from the religion
of Christes faith, commaunded that he should be behedded.
In the way as he was ledd to his death, he came to a floudde
which with a very swift course ranne betwixt him and the pla∣ce
where he should suffer. Now he saw a great company of all
sexes, degrees, and ages going with him to the place of his exe∣cution,
in so much that it semed the iudge was left alone at
home without any to attend vppon him. This company was
so great, and the bridge they had to passe ouer so litle, that it
would be toward night, er they all could get ouer. Albane lon∣ging
much for his blessed death, and hasting to his Martyrdo∣me,
cumming to the riuers side and making there his prayer
with lifting vp his eyes and harte to heauen, sawe furth wyth
the bottom to haue bin dried vp, and the water geue place for
him and the people to passe ouer dryshod as it were vpon euen
grownde. Which when among other the executioner which
should haue beheddid him did see, he made hast to mete him, at
the place appointed for his death, and there (not without the
holy inspiration of God) he fell downe flat before his feete, and
casting from him the sword which he held in his hande ready
drawen, desired rather that he might be executioned ether for
him or with him, rather then to do execution vpō him. Where
vpō this mā being now made a fellow of that faith wher of be∣fore
he was persecutor, and the swerd lying in the groūd before
thē, the other officers staggering and doubting all who might
take it vpp and doe the execution, the holy confessor of God
with the people there assembled went vnto a hill almost half a
mile of from that place beautifully garnished with diuers her∣bes
and flowers not rough or vneasy to climme, but smothe,
<PB REF="33"/>
plaine and delectable, worthy and mete to be sanctified with
the blood of the blessed Martyr, vnto the the top where of
when he was ascended, he required of God to giue him water:
and strayt there arose a spryng of fayer water before his feete
whereby all might perceaue that the riuer before was by his
meanes dried. For he which left no water in the riuer, would
not haue required it in the topp of the mowntaine, but that it
was so expedient, for the glory of God in his holy martyr.
For beholde the riuer hauing obeyed the Martyr, and serued
his deuotion, leauing behinde a testimony of duty and obedi∣ence
(the Martyr hauing now suffered) returned to his nature
againe. Here therfore this most valiaunt martyr being behed∣ded
receiued the crowne of life which God promiseth to them
that loue him. But he which there tooke vppon him to doe
that wicked execution, had short ioy of his naughty deede: for
his eyes fel vnto the ground with the head of the holy martyr.
There also was behedded the souldiour which being called of
God refused to stryke the holy confessor of God: of whom it
is open and playne, that though he was not Christened in the
fount, yet he was baptised iu the bath of his owne blud, and so
made worthy to enter in to the kingdome of heuen. Now the
iudge seing so many straunge and heuenly miracles wrought
by this holy martyr, gaue commaundement that the persecu∣tion
should cease, beginning to honour in the sayntes of
God the constant and pacient suffering of death, by the
which he thought at first to bring them from the deuotion
of their fayth. S. Albane suffered his martyrdome the xx.

Aboue the west creeke towarde the right hand standeth a citte
called <HI>Alcuith,</HI> which in their language is as much to say as the
Rock <HI>Cluith,</HI> for it standeth by a fludd of the same name. The
Britannes then being thus afflicted by the sayd nations, sent
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
their embassadours wyth letters vnto Rome, wyth lamentable
supplications requiring of them ayde and succour, promising
them their continuall fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, so that they would reskue them a∣gainst
the oppression of their sayd enemies: where vppon there
was sent vnto them a legion of armed souldiours from Rome,
which commyng in to the iland and encountering wyth the e∣nemies,
ouerthrew a great number of them, and draue the rest
owt of the fruntiers of the coūtry, and so setting them at liber∣te

and that don, they returned home with great triumph.
But the Britons buylding the wall which they wer bid to make,
not of stone as they wer willed, but of turue, as hauing none a∣mong

them to litle purpose. This walle they made betwen the ij.
sayd armes or creekes of the sea, many myles longe, that wher as
the fense of the water lacked, there by the helpe of the trēch they
might kepe their country from the breakyng in of their enne∣mies.
Of which pece of wurke, there remayneh euen vnto this

of the enemies, and such as could eskape chased them ouer
the seas in to their owne conntry, which before wer wont to
waste and spoyle the country of Britanny wythout resistance.
Then the Romans toulde the Brytans playne, that it was not
for their ease to take any more such trauaylous iourneis for

was preached by them not only in their churches, but also in
the open stretes and in the country, in such sort that in all

And in short time thourough their authoritie; vertue,

<P><HI>Gregorius aunswereth.</HI> It is permitted by a certaine law of the

ioyned together in wedlock. But experience sheweth that of
such wedlocke their can growe no children, and the holy lawe
forbiddeth that we should reuele the turpitude of our kinde∣red.
Wherefor it is necessary that it be the third or the fourth
generation that should be permitted to marrye. As for the
second must in any wise forbeare one from the other.
To marry with our steppe mother, it is a greuous offen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, for

But bycause it is written,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 2.</NOTE> <HI>They shal be two in one fleshe,</HI> he that
presumeth to reuele the turpitude of his steppe mother, whiche
was one flesh with his father, he truly reueleth the turpitude of
his father. It is also forebidden the to marry with thy brothers
wife, for that by her former mariage she was one flesh with
thy brother, for whiche cause Iohn Baptiste was behedded
and suffered holy martyrdome. To whom though it was not
sayd, that he should deny Christe, yet was he killed for the con∣fession
of Christe. For in that oure Lorde Iesus Christe sayd
I am the truth, for that he was killed for the truth, he shed his
bloud also for Christ. And whereas there be many of the
English people, which whiles they were yet infideles, were thus
vnlawfully coupled, when they commeth to the faith they are
to be warned, that they forbeare, and take it to be a right gre∣uous
offense. Teache them to feare the dredfull iudgementes
of God, least for vnlaufull carnall loue they runne in dawn∣ger
of hell fyre. And yet for this are they not to be kept from
the communion of the body and bloud of our Sauiour Chri∣ste,
least you may seeme to punish such thinges in them, which
they committed by ignorance before their baptisme. For at
this present time the holy church with a zele doth punish so∣me
thinges, some other of a mekenes it doth tolerat, at some
other it winketh vppon consideration. Yea it so beareth and
dissembleth, that the euill which it hateth, by bearing and dis∣sembling
it redresseth. All such as commeth to the faith, ar
to be warned that they committe no such thing, and if they

mindes of the euell disposed. For why? It is written in the law,
he that passeth through an other mans feilde, shall not thrust
his syckle in to his corne, but rubbe the eares with his hande,
and so eate them. Neither canst thou thrust the syckle of iudg∣ment
into the corne that is committed vnto an other mans
charge, but with the example of thy well doing, thow mayst
rub of the chaffe of syn from gods corne, and by treating and
persuading with them, conuert them to the body of the church
of Christ, as a man doth the meate he eateth, in to his owne.

<P><HI>Augustines question.</HI> Whether a woman that is great with
childe may be baptised? Or how long after she is brought a

childe that is borne, how longe shall it tarry er it be baptised
lest it be preuented by death? Or how long after she is brought
a bed, shall her husband forbeare her carnall company? Or if
she be in her monethly desease, whether she may cum to the
church or be receiued to the mystery of holy communion?
Or the mā after he hath carnally knowen his wife, whether he
may enter in to the church before he hath washed him self with
water, or receiue the mystery of the holy communion? Of all
<PB N="36" REF="50"/>
the which the rude English nation had nede to be infor∣med.</P>
<P><HI>Gregorius answereth.</HI> I doubt not but you haue ben re∣quired
counsell in their matters, and I think also I haue made
you already aunswer herein. Yet that which youerselfe could
say and thinke herein, I think you wold haue it confirmed
with my aunswer. The woman with child, why should she not
be christened, seing to be teeming is no synne before the eyes
of allmighty God? For our first fathers, when they had syn∣ned
in paradise by the right iudgment of God, they lost the
immortalite which they had receiued. And for so much as
God wold not vtterly destroy mankynd for his syn in punish∣ment
of his syn, he tooke from him the benefite of immor∣talite.
And yet of his mercy and goodnes he reserued vnto
him the encrease of issue. That then which of the gift of God
is reserued vnto the nature of mā, by what reason should it be
restrained from the grace of baptisme? For in that sacrament
by the which all syn is vtterly taken away, it is great folly to
think any man to be restrayned from the gift of that grace
which is willing to receiue it. When the woman is deliuered,
how many daies after she shall cum to the church it is plaine
to be knowen by the commaundement of the ould testament
which saith thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 12.</NOTE> <HI>The woman which hath borne a male childe shall
remaine xxxiij. daies in the blud of her purification<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she shall towch
no holy thing nor shall enter into the sanctuary, vntil the daies of her
purification be fulfilled. But if she haue brought fourth a femal child,
lxvj. dayes she shall remaine in the blud of her purificatiō.</HI> Which yet
is to be knowē that it is taken in mistery: for if the same hower
that she is deliuered she should cum to the church, she should
run in no danger of gods displeasure. For it is the pleasure
of the flesh not the paine that causeth the syn. The plesure is
in begetting the childe, but bearing is the paine and trauaile.
Wher vppon it was sayed vnto oue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first mother which first

paines and thou shalt bring fourth in sorowe.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 3.</NOTE> If then we forebid
the womā which is deliuered, to cū to the church, we make as
though her paine wer her syn. By no waies then it is forbidden
to christen ether the woman that is deliuered, or the childe
wherof she is deliuered, yea the very first hower ether of the
deliuery of the one, ether of the birth of the other, if any of
them both be in perill of death. For the grace of the sacra∣mēt,
as it is to be geuen vnto the liuing with great discretiō, so
is it to be offred without delay to thē which draweth toward
their death: lest while time conuenient to geue the mystery of
our redemption is looked and taried for, by meanes of delay
the partie dye before he may receiue the sayed benefit. Nether
shall the man carnally accompany with his wife, vntill the
child that is borne be weaned. But now by a corrupte custom,
the wemen refuse to nourse the children borne of their owne
body: which seme to haue ben found out only of inconti∣nence:
for therfore they refuse to nourse their owne children,
by cause they will not forbeare the company of their husban∣des.
Wherfor such as of an euill custome do put out their chil∣dren
to nourse, shall not lye with their husbande vntill the
daise of her purification be fully complet. Also in the time of
of her flowers they ar forbid to cōpany with their husbande.
So that the ould law doth punish thē which hath to doe with
a woman being in that case. Which woman yet neuerthelesse
is not then forbidden to cum to the church, because the super∣fluite
of nature can not be imputed for syn: and for that she
suffereth that against her will, it is no reason she should be re∣strained
from cūming into the church. For we know that the
womā which was deseased with the bluddy flix coming hūbly
behind our lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 8.</NOTE> touched the hem of his garment, and by
and by she was cured of her said infirmite. If then the woman
which had the bluddy flix, might laufully touch the garment
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
of our Lord, why may not she enter into the church which
suffereth her monethly flours? But you will say: as for her, her
malady forced her to seeke remedy, this other is taken of
her customable sycknes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of natu∣ral infirmi¦ties.</NOTE> Consider this with thy selfe deare
brother, that all that we suffer in this mortall flesh by feblenes
of nature, it was by the iust iudgement of God ordained after
our syn. As hunger, thrist, heate, cold, werinesse, procedeth of
the infirmite of nature. And what other thing is it to seeke
foode against hunger, drinck against thirst, open ayre against
heate, garmente against colde, rest against wearinesse,
but to take medicine againste sycknes? So vnto the wo∣man
that monthly course of her body is a desease. If then
she did well presume which being sycke touched the garment
of our Lorde, that which is graunted to one woman, why
should it not be graunted vnto all other, which by nature ar
greued with like sycknesse? Nether shall she be forebidden in
the sayd daies to receiue the holy sacrament: but if of a great
reuerence which she hath there vnto, she will not presume to
receiue it, she is the more to be praised: but if she doe receiue
it, she is the lesse to be iudged.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> For it is the point of well dispo∣sed
mindes there to acknoledg their fault sum times, where
there is none in dede. For many times that is committed with∣out

when we ar hungry is no faute, and yet hungar began and
sprange first of the syn of our first father. And that mounthe∣ly
custome is no syn to the woman, for that it happenyth na∣turally.
But yet bycause nature is so corrupted, that without
the mans will, it semeth to be defiled, it had his first originall
of syn, and remaineth as a punishment, to thintent man might
now know what he is becum through the iustice of God by
syn. And that man which did cōmit sinne with his wil, should
feele the punishment of syn against his wil. And therfor we∣men

The law commaundeth the olde people, that the man which
hath had to doe with his wife, shal both wash him selfe with
water, and not enter the church before the going downe of
the son. Which saying yet maye spiritually be construed: for
then spiritually the man hath to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with the woman, when
the minde doth delite him selfe with vncleane thoughts of vn∣laufull
lust. And except this fire of lust be quenched, he shall
not think him self worthy the company of the faithfull bre∣thern,
which findeth him selfe possessed with vnchaste desires.
Though of this thinge diuers countries ar of diuers myndes,
<PB N="38" REF="52"/>
and sum vseth one thing, sum an other, yet the maner of the
Romans was euer of auncient time, after the company of
their owne wyues both to purify them selues in the bath, and
of reuerence a while to forbeare cumming in to the church.
We say not this for that we take mariage to be syn.<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhether in the acte of maria∣ge be any sinne.</NOTE> But for
that the very laufull company of man and wife is not with∣out
pleasure of the flesh: and that pleasure can not be all toge∣ther
without sum syn. For he was not borne of aduou∣try
or fornication but of laufull wedlocke which sayeth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50.</NOTE> <HI>Be∣hold
I am begotten in iniquite, and my mother hath conceiued me
in syn.</HI> He which knewe him selfe to haue ben concei∣ued
in syn, mourned to remember his synfull byrthe.
For the tree doth beare in his braunches, the corrupte humours
which he drew of the roote. In the which wordes yet he
dothe not call the carnall company of man and wife synne,
but the pleasure therein. For there be many thinges, whiche
of them selues be lawfull and allowable, and yet in the doing
of them we ar sumwhat defiled. As oftentimes being angry we
punish other mens faultes, whereby the calmnes of our mind is
troubled: and though it be well done that we doe, yet is it not
well that in doing it our minde is putt out of quiet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 30.</NOTE> For he was
angry with the vice of the offenders, which said, <HI>Myne eye is
troubled with anger.</HI> For whereas the minde can not lift him self
vp vnto the light of contemplation, except it be still and quiet,
therefore he sorowed to see his eye distempered with anger.
For while he was forced to looke downeward to punish the
transgressours, he was forced also to be withdrawen from the
contemplation of thinges which are aboue. So then it is a
commendable thing to be moued with anger against synne,
and yet is it a grief and a hinderance to the well disposed min∣de: for
in that he hath ben angry, he knoweth that he hath of∣fended.
Wherefore, to come to the purpose, the right vse of car∣nall
company betwene man and wife, is to come together for
<PB REF="53"/>
procreation of children, not for lust and pleasures sake. And if
any man doth vse his wife not for carnall pleasure, but to the
ende of procreation only, this man truly is to be left vnto his
owne discretion, both for comming vnto the church and also
for receiuing of the holy sacrament of the body and bloud of
our Lord. For he is not to be kept ether from the one or the o∣ther,
which being in the fire yet can not be burned. But when
on the contrary, not the desire of issue, but the pleasure of the
body beareth the chiefest rule in the worke of copulation, they
haue both cause to bewaile their frailte. For thoughe the worde
of god did graunt them so much, yet doth it not so graunt it
them, that they should be out of feare of offence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 7.</NOTE> For as saynt

which is laufull of it selfe. Wherfore in that he vseth this worde

our Lord entending to speake vnto the people in the mounte
of Sina gaue commaundement they should first abstaine from

to befall vnto a man in his dreame, a lay man may receiue the

<P><HI>Gregorius answereth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of night¦ly pollu∣tiōs or i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lusions.</NOTE> The testament of the ould law, as we
haue aboue sayd, saithe him to be defiled, and suffereth him not
to enter the church before euening, and not but first bathed.
Which thing the spirituall people otherwise vnderstanding,
shall take it in like sense as we haue aboue declared. For he is
deluded as it were by dreame, whiche being tempted with vn∣clenesse,
is defiled with true imaginations in his thought. But
he washith him selfe with water, that is, he washeth away with
teares the filth of his thoughtes: And except the fire of tempta∣tion
go out, let him take him selfe guilty as it were vnto the e∣uening.
But in this maner of elusions, there is a difference to
be had. For a man must narrouly search and discusse him selfe,
of what cause this thing commeth into his minde, when he is
a sleape. For sometimes it commeth of surfet, sometimes of su∣perfluite
or weakenes of nature, and somtimes also of vncleane
thoughtes. When it commeth of the superfluite or infirmite of
nature, it is nothing at all to be feared. For the minde in this <MILESTONE N="1"/>
case more soroweth that it hath willingly suffered, then that it
hath any thinge wittingly committed. But when it hath risen
thourow inordinat excesse of diet, wherby the vessels of these∣minall <MILESTONE N="2"/>
humours ar replenished, the minde thereby is not cleare
and voide of fault: yet it is not guilty of so great fault, that the
mā thereby is to be withholden, ether from receiuing of the sa∣crament,
ether from saying of masse. Bicause it may happē that
ether it is holy day, ether of necessite the partye must say mas∣se,
for that there is no other priest to be gotten in that pla∣ce.
And if there be other at hand, yet the illusion comming
only of surfet, is no sufficient cause to make a man forbeare the
receite of the holy mysteries. Yet from the offering of the holy
sacrifice he ought (as I thinke) meekely forbeare, though not
from receiuing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> except the minde withall be defouled with so∣me
<PB REF="54"/>
vncleane phantasies. And though the partye do not remem¦ber,
that in his dreame he sustayned any such phantasies, yet by
his owne iudgement he is not guyltles, if in the dayes before, he
remembreth he had offended in gluttonous feding of the body.
<MILESTONE N="3"/> But if it riseth of any foule thoughtes, which he had wakyng,
the offence is open and manifest of it self. For he doth see owt
of what roote that pollution did spring. For the euell that he
wittingly thought vppon, that vnwittingly he committed.
<MILESTONE N="4"/> But here agayne we must consider, whether that thought
sprang of suggestion, of delite, or of consent. For by these three
all maner of synne is fulfilled. Suggestion is by the diuel, delite
by the flesh:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suggestiō Delight. Consent.</NOTE> consente by the spirite: The diuell was the first
prompter to synne. Eua as it wer the flesh took delite therin.
Adam as it wer the spirite consented. And herin is requisite
great discretion, that the mynde as iudge ouer him selfe should
discerne betwext suggestion and delite, betwext delite and
consent. For when the wycked fend doth rayse the first mo∣tions
vnto synne in ower harte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How sin bredeth in the har¦tes of mē.</NOTE> if there follow no delite therin
in the mynde, there is no synne at all committed. But when
the flesh begynneth to take delite therin, then synne begyn∣neth
to springe: If then aduisedly he doth agree thereunto,
then syn is perfyted. So that in suggestion is the begynning, in
delite the feeding, in consent the finishing of synne. And it
ofte chaunceth that the euill, that the diuell soweth in the
thought, the flesh therin deliteth, add yet the soule doth not
agree ther vnto. And though the flesh can fele no delite with∣out
the soule, yet the soule stryuing against the pleasures of
the flesh, is against his will hampred with the plesure of the
flesh in such sorte, that with reason he doth gaynsaye and not
agree vnto it, and yet is bound with delite, but so that he much
lamenteth his bande. Wher vppon that principall champion
of the heauenly army S. Paule, bewayled him selfe saying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7.</NOTE> <HI>I
fynd a law in my lymmes, repining against the law of my mynd and
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
leading me away prisoner in the law of synne which is in my lym∣mes.</HI>
If he wer prisoner, then he did not fight: and if he did fight
why was he prisoner? He then stryued wyth the law of his
mynd, against the which the lawe of his flesh dyd fyght. Then
if he fought, he was not in bondes. Man therefore is both bon∣de
and free: free throwgh righteousnes which he loued, and
bonde throwgh the delite, which he boare against his will.

him, what I haue of longe time deuised with my selfe of the
cause of the English men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy wa∣ter, aultars and re∣likes.</NOTE> That is to with that not the temples
of the Idols, but the Idoles which be in them be broken, that
holy water be made and sprinkled about the same temples, al∣tars
buylded, relikes placed. For if the sayd churches be well
made, it is nedefull that they be altered frō the worshipping of
diuels in to the seruice of God: that whiles the people doth not
see their temples spoiled, they may (forsaking their error) be
moued the more ofte to haunt their wont place to the ho∣nor
and seruice of God. And for that they are wōte to kill oxē
in sacrifice to the diuells, they shal vse the same slaughter now,
but chaunged to a better purpose. It may therefore be permit∣ted
them, that in the dedication dayes or other solemne daies
of martyrs, they maketh them bowers about their churches,
and feasting together after a good religious sorte, kill their ox∣en
now to the refreshing of them selues, to the praise of God,
and encrease of charite, which before they wer wont to offer
vp in sacrifice to the diuells: that whiles sum outward comfor∣tes
ar reserued vnto them, they may thereby be brought the
rather to the inward comfortes of grace in God. For it is dout∣lesse
impossible from men being so rooted in euell customes,
to cut of all their abuses vppon the sodaine. He that laboreth
to clim vpp vnto a highe place, he goeth vpward by steppes

and pases, not by leapes. So vnto the childrē of Israel being in
Aegipt our Lord was wel knowē. But yet he suffered them to
doe sacrifice vnto him still in offring vp of beastes vnto him,
which otherwise they wold haue offered vpp vnto the diuels,
as they wer wont to doe in the land of Egypt, that altering
their intente, they should leue sum, and also kepe sum of their
ould sacrifices: that is, that the beastes which they offred be∣fore,
they should now offer still. But yet in offring them vnto
the true God, and not vnto the diuels they should not be the
same sacrifices in all pointes as they wer before. These be the
thinges which I think expedient you declare vnto our sayd

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A letter of S. Gregorie to Augustine exhorting him that he should not glorie in him selfe of his vertues, and miracles.</P>

<HEAD>The. 31. Chap.</HEAD>
<P>ABout this time he sent <HI>Augustine</HI> an epistle touching
such miracles as he had knowen to be done by the said
<HI>Augustine.</HI> In the which epistle he exhorteth him, that
he should take no pride of minde therefore. I know (saith he)
deare brother, that it pleaseth god to shewe by thee great mira∣cles
amōg the people, which by thee he hath called to his faith.
Wherevpon it is nedefull that of that heauenly gifte, both thou
ioyest with feare, and fearest with ioye. Thou hast to ioye for
that by meanes of the said miracles the Englishmens soules are
wonne to the faith. Thou hast to feare, leste through the mira∣cles,
which be don by thee, thy weake mind be lifted vp in pre∣sumption
falling as farre inwardly by vaine glory, as thou arte
by outward praise puffed vp. We must remember that the di∣sciples

them. <HI>Doe you not reioyce tereat, but rather reioyce for that your
names are written in heauen.</HI> For they had fastened their mind
vppon a priuate and temporall ioye when they ioyed of their
miracles. But Christ calleth them backe from priuate ioy vn∣to
commune, and from temporall to eternall, when he said:
<HI>Ioy for that your names are written in heauen.</HI> For not all the cho∣sen
of god doth miracles, but yet all their names are written in
heauen. For why? They which be the disciples of the truth,
ought to ioye in nothing, but only in that good thing, which
all other good shall haue, as well as they, and whereof they all
shall haue ioy without ende. This therefore remaineth deare
beloued brother, that of the thinges whiche by the power of
god thou workest outwardly, thou exactly euer discusse thy
selfe inwardly, and thourouly vnderstand both thy selfe who
thou arte, and what plenty of grace god hath bestowed vppon
that countrie, for whose sake, (to thentēt it might be the rather
conuerted) thou hast receiued the gift of working miracles.
And if thou remember, that thou haste at any time ether by

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the life, lerning, and death, of blessed Pope Gregory.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The. 1. Chapter.</HEAD>
<P>IN the yeare of the incarnation of our Lord
605.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 605.</NOTE> the hollie pope Gregory (when he had
most gloriously gouerned the see of the Ro∣man
and Apostolique churche. 13. yeares. 6. mo∣neths
and. 10. dayes) departed this lyfe, and was
translated to the eternall seate of the kyngdome of heauen.
Of whome it becometh me in this our historie of the churche
of England more largely to speake: bycause by his diligence he
conuerted our nation, that is, the Engleshmen from the powre
of Satan, to the fayth of Christ. Whome we maye well, and
also must call our Apostle. For as sone as he was high Bishop
ouer the whole wordle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Grego∣ry Bishop ouer the whole worlde. 1. as head thereof.</NOTE> and appointed gouerner of the chur∣ches
lately conuerted to the belefe of the trueth, he made our

of him the sayng of the Apostle: That althowgh he
were not an Apostle to others, yet he was vnto vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Grego∣ry our Apostle. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.</NOTE> For <HI>the sig∣net

was a Roman borne, his fathers name <HI>Gordian,</HI> his pedegre of
awncient stocke not only noble, but also religiouse. For Felix
somtime bishop of that same see Apostolique, a man of greate
renomme in Christe, and the churche, was his greate grandfa∣thers
father. This nobilite of religion he kept, and maintayned,
with no lesse vertue, and deuotion, then his parents, and aunci∣ent
kinsfolke had done befor him. But his woldly nobilite he
<PB REF="60"/>
forsoke alltogether and by the speciall grace of God turned
the same to the purchasing of eternall glorie in heauen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Grego∣ry a reli∣gious mā.</NOTE> For
changing sodenly his secular habite he wēt into a monasterie:
Where he began to lyue in such grace of perfection, that vnto
his mynde (as often after he was wont to wytnes with wee∣ping
teares) all transitorie things were already subiecte, that he
far surmounted al worldly workes, that he was wont to thinke
of nothing, but heauenly things, yea, that being yet clogged
with his erthly bodie, he now by contemplation did passe the
verie naturall bounds of his flesh, and that he derely loued de∣ath
also, whiche to most men is a paynfull payne, as an entra∣unce
of lyfe to him, and reward of his labour. All which things
he sayd of him selfe, not craking of his encrease in vertues, but
rather lamenting the lacke, and decaye of thē. In which defecte
(as he was wont to saye) he thought himselfe nowe to haue
fallen by reason of his ecclesiasticall charge, and occasion of
greater care. For talking on a time secretly with Peter, his dea∣con,
when he had recompted the olde giftes, and vertuous gra∣ces
of his minde, strayght way he sayde sorowfully. But nowe
alas, by the meanes of this my ecclesiastical charges, my mynde
is encombred againe with secular affayres, and after the good
quyet and rest whiche it had, is nowe defiled againe with the
dust of earthly busines. And when condescending to manie, it
wandereth and roueth aboute owtward matters, after desiring
inward good thowghtes, it returneth therunto no dowbte, the
weaker. Therfore I weigh with my selfe what I doe now suf∣fer,
and I weigh also well, what I haue forgone. And when
I behold, what I haue lost, this that I suffer wexeth more gre∣ueouse.
Thus sayde this holie man of a greate and passing hu∣militie.
But we must thinke that he lost none of his monasti∣call
perfection by anye occasion or trowble of ecclesiasticall
charge or office of a Bishop: but rather that then he did much
more good, and profited more in vertue by the laboure of
<PB N="46" REF="60"/>
conuerting manye to the faythe, then he hadd done before
with the priuate quiet of his owne conuersation onlye. For
euen being bisshopp, he ordered his house like a monasterye.
For as sone as he was taken owte of the monasterye, and
ordayned to the ministerye of the aulter, being after∣warde
sent as legate from the see Apostolike to Constanti∣nople,
he for all that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Grego∣ry the po∣pes legat at Con∣stantino∣ple.</NOTE> in the earthly princes palace liued so, that
he neuer intermitted his purpose of heauenly conuersation.
For he toke with him certaine brethern of the monasterie
(which for verie brotherly loue folowed him to that Imperi∣all
citie) for the better keping, of his regular obseruance: that al∣waie
by their example (for so he writeth) he might be fastned
as with a stronge cable or anker to the pleasaunte porte of pra∣yer,
when soeuer he were tossed withe the raging whaues of
wordly cares, and might also strengthen his minde by daylie
conference, and reading with them, whensoeuer it shuld be
shaken with secular affaires. And truly he was by these mens
companie not only defended from the assaultes of the worlde,
and earthly troubles, but also more and more stirred vp to the
exercises of heauenly life. For they exhorted him, that he
would discusse and expound with some godly and misticall
interpretation the booke of blessed Iob, which was enwrapped
with manie greate obscurities. Neither could he denie them his
paines, which of brotherly loue moued him to this profitable
laboure: but hath therfore meruelously declared in 35. bookes
of Expositions, how this worke of Iobes historie, first is to be
vnderstāded according to the letter, them how it may be refer∣red
to Christe, and the sacramentes of the church, last in what
sense the same may be applied to euerie particular faithfull
man. Which worke he began to write, while he was legate in
Constantinople, but he finished it afterward when he was Bis∣shop
of Rome. This blessed man, being in Constantinople
supressed an heresie of the state of our resurrectiō (which then
<PB REF="61"/>
there arose) in the very beginning, by the force of catholike
trueth, and verite.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Grego∣ry repres∣seth an heresy ri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in Constan∣tinople.</NOTE> For <HI>Eutychius</HI> Bishop of Constantinople
began to preache a false doctrine, which was, that our bodies
in the glorie of the resurrection shuld be so subtile, as is either
the winde, or ayer: so that it should not be possible to feele', or
touche them. Which when S. Gregory had heard, he proued
this opinion to be quite contrary to the right faith by the rea∣son
of truth, and also by the example of the resurrection of our
Lorde. For the right, and catholike faith beleueth, that our bo∣dies
being exalted in the glorie of immortalitie, shal in dede be
subtile by the effect of spiritual poure, but yet not withstāding
able to befelt, and touched for the truth of our nature: accor∣ding
to the example of the bodie of our Lorde of which now
rosen from death him selfe sayde to his disciples: <HI>Touche ye and
see, for aspirite hath nor flesh, nor bones as ye see me haue.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 24.</NOTE> In the as∣sertion
of this faith the right reuerend father Gregory did la∣boure
so much against this vpstert heresie, quenched the same
with such diligence, and so vanquished it by the healp of the
vertuous Emperour <HI>Tiberius Constantinus,</HI> that from thence
forth noman was founde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wor¦kes of S. Gregory,</NOTE> which durst be a styrrer vp againe,
or mainteiner therof. He made also an other excellent booke,
which is called the Pastorall. Wherin he declareth plainly,
what manner of man he ought to be, which should be chosen
to rule the churche. And how the rulers therof ought to lyue
them selues, and with what discretion instruct euery one of
their hearers, and also with how great consideration they shuld
daily weigh their owne weakenes. Moreouer he wrote. 40. ho∣milies
vppon the Gospell, which he hath diuided by equall
nūber into 2. volumes. He made also 4. bookes of dialogues, in
which at the request of his Deacon Peter, he hath gathered
the vertuous dedes, of holy men, which him selfe could either
knowe in Italie, or heare of, for their same, to the example of
good lyfe for all the posterite. That like as in his bookes of Ex∣positions
<PB N="47" REF="61"/>
he teacheth, in what vertues a man must laboure, so
by the describing of holy mens miracles he might shewe, what,
and how greate the excellencie of those vertues is. Furdermore
bicause<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the first and last partes of <HI>Ezechiel</HI> the prophet semed
obscure and darke, he hath fully shewed by 22. Homilies,
how much light, and good matter is within them. That I nede
not speake of his smal booke of answers, which he wrot back to
the questiōs of S. Austin the first bishop of Englishmen, as I ha¦ue
declared before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. cap. 27.</NOTE> placing the whole booke it self in this mine
historie. Neither of his other littell booke of Synodes, or Coū∣cels,
which he hath made moste profitably, conferring with the
bishops of Italie for the necessarie affaires of the church. Nor of
his familiar letters, sent vnto diuers men. Surely it is my thinke,
maruaile, that he should write so manie, and such great volumes
being (as he saith of him self) almost in al his youth vexed with
the paines of his bowells, and entralles, by the weakenes of his
stomake euer more sickly, and made faint and feble with agues
though not verie feruent for the time, yet with quotidians
continually trubling him. But in these his greate griefes coun∣ting
carefully with him selfe, that the scripture saithe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Euerie
sonne which is receiued, is scourged before,</HI> the harder he was kept
downe with these present aduersities, the more certainly did
he lifte vp himselfe, with the hope of euerlasting comforte.
And this muche haue I sayde hitherto in the praise of his ex∣cellent
witte, which could not, no not with so greate weakenes
of the bodie, be any thing debated. Now whereas other bishops

<HEAD>The 2. Chap.</HEAD>
<P>ABowt this tyme <HI>Austin</HI> by the ayde and healpe of
king <HI>Elbert</HI> called together the Byshops and doctours
of the greatest prouince, and nearest to him, whiche
were the Britons, to cōmune with thē, into a place whiche vn∣tyl

and strength of <HI>Austin,</HI> being in the borders of the <HI>Vectias,</HI> and
west Saxons. There he began with brotherly admonition to
perswade thē to be at peace, and catholike vnitie with him, and
<PB REF="64"/>
to communicate with him for Gods sake the laboure of pre∣ching
the gospell to the heathen of England. For as yet they
kept not the Easter sondaye in dew time, but from the. 14. to
the. 20. moone. Which compte is concluded in the cōpas of. 84.
yeares. They vsed moreouer manie other thinges contrarie to
the vnitie of the church. Which when they had ben with longe
discours declared, and these men neyther for prayers or exhor∣tations,
neyther for rebukes or threttes of <HI>Austin,</HI> and his com∣panie
would geaue their assent, but rather preferred their own
traditions before all other churches whiche throwgh owt the
whole worlde agreed with <HI>Austin</HI> in Christe, then this holie
father made an end of so lōge and troblesome stryfe, saying in
this wyse. Let vs praye vnto God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 67.</NOTE> <HI>which doth make men all of one
minde and accord to dwel in his fathers howse,</HI> that he will vowch∣safe
to signifie vnto vs by some heauenly signes, whiche tra∣dition
is to be folowed, and by what wayes we must spedely
walke to the entrance of his kingdome. Therfore let here be
browght forth some sicke body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Apo¦stles Faith cōfirmed by a mi∣racle.</NOTE> and by whose praiers he shalbe
healed, let his fayth be beleaued, and his godly doinge be folo∣wed
of vs all. To this when his aduersaries had graunted al∣thowgh
verie vnwillingly, there was presented a certaine blind
Englishman. Who being offred to the Briton priestes, when
by their ministerie he was not holpen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e coulde be cured, at
the length S. <HI>Austin</HI> compelled by iust, and greate necessitie fel
on his knees to the father of our Lord Iesus Christe, beseching
him, that he would restore sight to this blinde person, that had
lost it, and that by the corporall illumination, and bodely ligh∣tning
of one man, his spiritual grace mought enkendle light in
the hartes of manie faythfull. And forthwith the blynde man
sawe: and Austin was praised of the people as a trew precher of
all trueth and veritie. Then these Britons confessed in deade,
that they vnderstod, that to be the true waye of ryghteousnes,
which <HI>Austin</HI> had preched and shewed thē. But yet they sayde,
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>
that they coulde not alter and change their olde customes and
ordinances without the consent and licens of their clerges and
people. They desyred therefore that they myght haue a
seconde Synode of a greater multitude. Whiche when it
was appointed to be so, there came by reporte seauen
Briton Bisshops, and many other well lerned men speci∣ally
oute of their greatest monasterie at <HI>Bangor,</HI> where at that
time <HI>Dynoth</HI> was Abbot. These men being now redie to goe
to the forsaide Synode came first to a certaine holy and wise
man (which lyued there about an Anchoretes lyfe) to aske his
counsel, whether they ought at Austins preaching and exhor∣tation
leaue their traditions, or no? Who answered them: if he
be a mā of God, folow him. But how shal we proue (sayd they)
that he is a man of God? The Anchoret answered: our Lord
sayth, <HI>take ye on yow my yooke, and lerne ye of me. For I am milde,
and humble of haerte.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE> Yf therfore this Austin be milde, and hum∣ble
of harte, it is likely that him selfe beareth the yooke of
Christ, and will offer you the same to beare. But if he be curst,
and proude, it is certaine, that he is not of God, neither must
we much esteme his wordes. Then they enquired againe of
him, how they might know whether this Austin were proude,
or no? Marry quoth he, prouide ye that he with his compaine
come firste to the place of the Synode, or counsell house.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ge∣neral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ru∣le of our Sauiour euil con∣strued in a particu∣lar case.</NOTE>
And if when ye approche nere, he ariseth courteously to you,
thinke ye that he is the seruant of Christe, and so heare ye him
obediently. But if he despise yow, nor will vouchesafe to ryse
at your presence, which are the more in number, let him like∣wise
be despised of yowe. And truly as this Anchoret bad
them, so did they. For it happened that when they came thither
S. Austin was alredy there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sate in his chayre. Which when
they sawe, straight waye wexing wrothe they noted him of
pride, and therfore endeuored to ouerthwarte and gainsaye,
what soeuer he proposed. His oracion briefly was thus: Al∣though
<PB REF="65"/>

churche of Christe, yet not withstanding if ye will in
these 3. thinges consent, and obey vnto me: that is, to celebrate
the Easter in dew time, to accomplish the ministerie of baptis∣me
(by which we are borne againe to God) according to the
maner of the holie Roman, and Apostolike churche, and last
of all to preache with vs to this English natiō the word of our
Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll your other ceremonies, rites, fashions, and customs
though they be contrary to oures, yet we will willingly suffer
thē, and be content to beare with thē. But they answered, that
they would doe none of the thinges requested, neither would
compre him for their Archebishop: sayeng with them selues:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wron∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣te surmi∣se.</NOTE>
Nay, if he would not so muche as rise to vs, truely the more we
shoulde now subiecte our selues to him, the more woulde he
hereafter despise vs, and set vs at naught. To whome the good
man of God S. Austen thretfully proficied, that, if they would
not take peace, and be at accord with their brethern, they
should receaue and feele warre from their enemies. And yf
they wold not preache to the English men the waye of ly∣fe,
they should suffer at their hande, and by their power the
vengeance of death. Which thing in al pointes came so to passe
as he forsayed, by the secret working of Gods iudgement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A true prophecy of S. Au∣gustin out Apo∣stle.</NOTE> For
it happened afterward, that the most mighty king of English
men Edilfrede (of whome I haue spoken before) gathering a
greate armie, made at the citie, which the English men call
Legacester, but the Britons better Carlege, a foule slaughter of
this vnfaithfull, and naughty people. For being now redy to
geue the onset of the fight, when he had spidde their priestes
(which came together to praye to God for the souldiers war∣ringe)
stand a parte from the rest in a sure and safe place, he
demaunded, what they were, and to what end they came thi∣ther?
Now the most parte of these priestes were of the mo∣nasterie
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>
of Bangor, where was sayde to be so great a num∣ber
of monkes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mo∣nastery of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gor in wales.</NOTE> that this monasterie being diuided in to seauen
companies, with eche companie his seuerall assigned ruler,
none of these compaines had lesse then 3. hundred persons,
who all did euer lyue by the labour of their owne handes.
Manie therefore of them after their 3. dayes fast, came with the
rest to thafforsaide armie, to pray for the souldiers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fasting and pray∣ing in schismati∣kes auai∣leth not.</NOTE> hauing also
by them a defendour named Brockmal, who should keape, and
preserue them from the weapons and strokes of their enemies,
while they were thus ernestly bent to their prayers. This the
cause of their comminge thither, when king Edelfrede had vn∣derstoode,
he sayd: Yf these men crie and call vppon their God
against vs, truly although they haue no armoure, yet they fight
against vs, who with their wicked wordes, and hatefull curses
persecute vs. Therefore he commaunded his souldiers first to
assault them. And so he vanquished after, the other parte of this
detestable hoste, but yet not without greate losse of his owne
men. It is reported, that there were slaine in that warres of
them which came to praye, aboute a thousande, and two hun∣dred
men, and only fiftie to haue escaped by flight. For Brock∣male
at the first comming of his ennemies fled straight with
all his souldiers, and whome he ought to haue defended, lefte
them all naked and bare to the strokes of the sworde. So in this
manner was fulfilled the prophetie of holye bishop Austin.
Who was himself longe before that taken out of this life to the
kingdom of heauen. And thus these vngratiouse, and false peo∣ple
suffred the punishment of temporal death, bicause they had
refused, and despised the holsome counsell of perpetuall life,
and saluation offered them.</P>

was <HI>Edwine,</HI> kinge of Northūberland, that is, king of all <MILESTONE N="3"/>
the inhabitants about the north parte of the fludd Hūber. This <MILESTONE N="5"/>
king being a prince of greater powre thē all other that ruled in
Britannie, raigned both ouer the English men, and Britons to,
except the people of Kent, and added moreouer to the English
dominions and kingdome, the Briton Ilandes called <HI>Meuanie,</HI>
which lye betwex Ireland and Britannie. The sixth was Os∣wald
king also of Northūberland a most Christen prince.
Whose dominions were as large. The seuenth was Oswy his
brother, keping the kingdome almost within equall boundes
for a certaine time. But after, he cōquered for the most part the
Pictes and Scotte; mē which dwelled in the North quarters of
Britāny: and made thē tributarie. But we wil speak of that here

a safegard, aud surtie for them, whom, and whose doctrine he
had now receiued. This Elbert was the son of Irminrike
whose father was Octa, and Octaes father Orrich, called also

<P>But after the death of Elbert, when Eadbald his sonne had ta∣ken

dammaged there the younge springes and tender encreases of
the churche. For he would not only not accept and main∣teyne
the faith of Christ, but he was also polluted and defiled
with suche a fornication, as the Apostle witnesseth neuer to
haue ben heard of amongest the gentils, which is, that he had
married his fathers wife. With which ij. heynouse factes he

encreased the trouble, and persecution of the churche. Who de∣parting
hence to the euerlasting kingdome of heauen, left his
iij. sonnes remaining yet paynims, heyres of his temporall
kingdome in earth. After the death of their father they began
straightwaie and openly to folowe idolatrie, which while their
father liued, they semed somewhat to haue relented: geuing al∣so
free licence to al their subiects to worship idols. These prin∣ces
on a certaine time when they sawe the bisshop in the chur∣che,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The peo∣ple do cōmunicat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Masse.</NOTE>

he answered: Yf ye wil be washed in that holsome font, whe∣rein

off the bishop, that it could not be, that without holy purging,

most holie oblation, they at last in their furie and rage sayde to
the bishop: well, if thou wilt not consent to vs in so smalle a

commaunded the night before he went, his

oftentimes spoken. Where, when after ma∣nie
his praiers, and teares powred out to God for the state of
the church, reposing his body to rest, and sleaping in his bed∣de,
the blessed Apostle S. Peter appeared to him: who scourging
him with sharp stripes a greate while in the close and secret
night, chalenged him with Apostolicall auctorite, and asked,
why he would forsake the flocke, which he himselfe had com∣mitted
vnto him? and to what shepeherd, renning now awa∣ye,
he would leaue the sheape of Christe besette in the mid∣dest

the seruant of Iesus Christe being styrred vp, and enco∣uraged,
came boldly to the king erly in the morning, and loo∣sing
his garment shewed him, how sore he was beaten, and
pitifully his flesh was torne. The king amased therat meruay∣led

to whyp and scourge such a man, as this Lawrence was. But as
sone as he had heard, that for his owne healthes sake and salua∣tion

abandoning all worship and honour of ydols, renouncinge al∣so

returned againe, <HI>Iustus</HI> to Rochester, where he was bishop. But
as for Mellite the Lōdoners wold not receaue, although he was
their bysshop, chosing rather, to obey idolatrouse bysshops then

the occasion that these peoples came to the faith, was suche:
The before named king <HI>Edwine</HI> was ioyned in affinite to the

by her hrother <HI>Edbald</HI> then king of Kent, that it was not
lawfull for a Christian woman, and virgin to be maried, or
spoused to a paynime, leste the faith and sacramente of the king
of heauen might be profaned by the companie of suche a
king as knew not the trew worshipping of God. Which answer
when the embassadours brought backe to kinge <HI>Edwine</HI> he
promised, that in anie case he wold doe nothing that shuld be

enough to kill the king out of hand, yet it might be he∣alped

therfore on Ester Sondaye vnto the king, who laye at the ry∣uer

the palace as an embassadour, which had earnest message
from his prince, and when with craftie speache he had a litle

The goodnes therfore of the hyghest maiestie of God, (who
with his only worde, and commaundement hath made, and
created all thinges, the heauen, the earthe, the sea, and all that in

For we thinke your hyghnes hath fully heard, and vnderstan∣deth

wheras we vnderstande the Souerayne Ladie your wyfe

and embrace the wicked superstition of them, thexamples of
their destroying and perditiō (which are estemed as Gods) can
sufficiently informe yow, of whome king Dauid in his psal∣mes

Therfore we can not by any discretion and iugement

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How king Edwine was prouoked to receiue the faith, by a vision appearing to him in bannishment.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The. 12. Chap.</HEAD>
<P>THus much did Pope Boniface by his letters, for the
conuerting of king Edwine, and all his countrie, which
king was also well holpen, and almost forced to re∣ceaue
the faithe, and marke diligently the holesome preceptes
<PB REF="78"/>
of Christian doctrine by an oracle, and vision from hea∣uen.
Which the goodnes of God vowchesafed to shewe
him, while he laye bannished in kinge Redwaldes courte, king
of the east Englishmen. For when bishop Pauline had well
perceaued that the princes haughty courage could hardly be
brought to the lowly humblenes of Christianite, and that it
would styfly be bowed and bent to beare the mysterie, and
burden of Christes crosse: when he remembred also, how he
had nowe laboured a longe tyme bothe with preaching to
the people, and with praying to Gods mercie for the salua∣tion
of king Edwine, and all his subiectes: at the lenght ha∣uing
lerned in sprite (for so it is most lykest to be,) what was
that vision, which had longe before ben shewed to the kinge
from heauen, he made no delayes at all, but came spedely to
the kinge, and warned him to fulfill and accomplishe his vo∣we,
whiche in the vision that appeared to him he had promi∣sed
to doe in case he were deliuered from his present miseries
and restored againe to his raygne, and kingdome. Nowe was
this vision suche, as foloweth: At what time king Edelfry∣de
Edwines predecessour with greuouse pursuing put Edwi∣ne
to flight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A vision, by the which Edwin the first Christen king of Northū∣berland was called to the fai∣the.</NOTE> and made him lye pryue, and lurke in diuers pla∣ces
of other realmes for manie yeres space as a bannished man:
at the lenghth Edwine came to king Redwald, besechinge
him, that he would saue him, and defend his life from the
traynes, and ernest serche of this his dedly ennemie. Who
gladly entertained hym, and promised to fullfill this his reque∣ste,
and petitiō. But after that king Edelfride had heard say that
Edwine was seene in that prouince, and vnderstood that he li∣ued
ther, and dwelled familiarly with all his cōpany, forthwith
he sent out his Embassadours to king Redwald, with a greate
somme of monie, to procure Edwines deathe. But it preuailed
nothing. Thē sent he the second tyme, and the thyrd tyme also
offring greater gyftes, and more plentifully bothe gold and
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
syluer thretning him at the laste warres, yf his request were
accomplished. Then king Redwald other dreading the threts
or corrupted with the brybes graunted his request, and promi∣sed
that he would put Edwyne to death himselfe, or els yeal∣de
him vp to thimbassadeurs. Which thing when a certayne
faythfull frend of Edwynes had marked and well vnderstoo∣de,
he entred incontinent to the chamber where Edwyne pur∣posed
to take his rest. For it was now an houre within nyght
and calling him forth, told him what the king had promised to
doe against him: sayeng in the end this muche: I shall therfore
(yf it so please yowe) leade yowe owt of this prouince, and
bryng yow into suche a place, that nother king Redwald, nor
yet king Edelfryde shalbe able to fynde yowe. To whome Ed∣wyne
answered in this maner: Sir, I thanke yow most hartely
for this your greate gentlenes. But I can not folowe your co∣unsell
herin. For first, I must not breake my promesse, which I
haue made to so greate and mightie a Prince as is king Red∣wald,
especially wheras he hath done me no harme, ne wronge,
nor hath as yet shewed anie hatred, or displeasure towardes me.
And truly if I must of necessite dye thus, I had rather he shuld
put me to deathe, then anie baser man or person of lesle nobi∣lite.
Agayne whether I pray yow shuld I flee nowe, who haue
so many yeares, and so long tyme walked lyke a vagabounde
through all prouinces of this yle of Britannie, only to auoyd
and eschewe myne enemies snares, and assaultes? Now when
this his frend was gone, Edwyne remained without alone and
sytting sadly before the palace begāne to be troubled with ma∣nie
stormes, and vexations of thoughts, as a man not witting
what to doe or whither to goe in this so ruefull case. After he
had ben longe vexed with inwarde, and priuie troubles of
mynde, burning inwardly with close fyre of secret sorowe, be∣hold,
in the greate sylence, and quyet of the mydde nyght
he sawe a man vtterly vnknowen to him bothe for visage and
<PB REF="79"/>
countenaunce, and also for his aray and apparell to approche
and drawe toward him. Whome bycause he had espyed thus at
a blushe, and so straungely desguised, he was not a lytle a fray∣de.
The straunger cometh euen vnto him, greteth him and
asketh him, wherfore he sate so soroufull on the stone abrode
watching, and all alone at that howre especially when other
men were within at rest, and in their depe sleape: Then Edwy∣ne
lykewise demaundyd of him, what he had to doe therwith,
yf he passed ouer the nyght within dore, or els without. To
whome this mā answered, and sayde: Thinke ye not but that I
know the cause of your heauynes, and watche. And also of this
your solitarie syttinge with out dores. For I know certainly
who ye be, and wherfore you are so sad, and soroufull. And al∣so
what myscheffe yow feare shortly shall befall you. But tell
me of fryndshippe, what reward would you geaue him, that
shuld now rydde yowe quyte out of all these sorowes, and
trowbles and persuade king Redwald, that neyther he himselfe
shuld hurte yowe, nor yealde yowe vp to your enemies, that
they myght slaye yow? When Edwyne answered that he
would geaue all that he possible could to anie suche a one for
reward of so good a turne, this mā added moreouer and sayde:
But what if besyde this, he do warrant you, that ye shalbe a
kinge, and all your enemies vanquished, yea and that in suche
sorte that you shall not only excell all your auncient proge∣nitours,
but also far passe in powre all the kinges of Englishe∣men,
which haue euer ben in this coūtrie. Here Edwyne being
made more firme, and constant by ofte questioning doubted
not to promis, that in all pointes, and at all tymes he wold be
answerable with worthie thankes geauing to the man that
shuld bestowe on him such greate benefites. Then this man
spake the thyrd tyme and sayde: But tell me againe, what yf be∣syde
all this, the same man, which sheweth yow now before,
truly, and vnfaynedly, that yow shall hereafter surely, and vn∣doubtedly
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
doubtedly haue suche and so greate benefites, can geaue yowe
also better coūsell, and more profitable for your sowles health,
and saluation, then euer any your parentes, and auncesters
heard of, could ye then consent, and obey him, and harken to
his holsome sayenges? Here Edwyne promised owt of hand
without anie lenger delaye, that he would altogether followe
his lerning, and doctrine which both could, and would deliuer
him presently from so manie miseries, and so greate daungers
as he was in, and exalte him afterward to the raygne and soue∣rantie
of his countrie. Which his answer was heard, and taken.
Then this man straightwaye, which had so long talked with
him, layde his right hande vpon Edwines heade, and said: when
these thinges therfore shall happen herafter in suche sorte to
yowe, remember well this tyme, and this our talke. And dif∣fer
not at that time to fulfil and accomplishe this, that yow do
nowe promesse me. Which being sayde, by and by he vanished
awaye. To the entent that Edwine might vnderstand and per∣ceaue,
that it was no man, but a ghoste which appeared to him.
Now when this younge prince was lefte alone, and sate there
solitarie, reioysing with himselfe for this gentle consolation,
and good comforte, but yet very careful, and muche counting
with himselfe who it shuld be or whence he shuld come which
had thus spoken, and talked familiarly with him: beholde his

For the kinges minde is chaunged. Neither dothe he purpose
nowe, or intend to doe yow any wronge, but rathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to defend
yowe, and accomplishe his promised fayth vnto yowe. For af∣ter
he had shewed the Quene in secret that his purpose, which
I told yowe of before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he dehorted him moste ernestly, and
withdrew him from so euill, and so deadly an intention, say∣ing
that it was in no wise mete for suche a king, of so greate

prowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and honour, as he was, to sell his best, and derest
frend, being now browght into straightes and miserie, for a
litle gold. Nor that he should breake his faith, and promesse,
which owght to be more estemed then al treasures, or not bide
by his word for the coueit, and loue of monie. But to be shorte
the king did euen as his Ladie had counselled him to doe. For
he not only not betrayed, and yelded to thembassadours this
his banished man Edwine: but helped him rather to the king∣dome.
For as sone as these embassad ours were thus with deni∣all
departed home againe, he gathered incontinētly a myghtie
armie to conquer king Edelfrede. Whome he slewe without
difficultie (bicause he marched forth against him hastely and
with a weake and vnordred oste) in the borders of the March∣land
men, at the Este syde of the riuer called Idle. For in de∣ade
kinge Edelfride had not time, and space enowgh grawnted
him to gather all his force together, and to ioygne his powre
with well disposing his hoste, and sowldiers in order. In this
skirmishe Renier king Redwalds sonne was slayne. And thus
Edwin according to the oracle which he had receiued, not on∣ly
auoyded the dawnger of his most dedly enemie, but also by
his death succeded in thonor of his Souerainte, and kingdome.
Now therfore to returne againe vnto my purpose, thowgh
Bishop Pawline seriously preched the word of God, yet kinge
Edwine slacked and lengered to beleaue him. Vsing yet for a
certaine space, at diuers competent howres to sitte solitarie, (as
I haue sayde before) and diligently to compte with him selfe,
what were best to be donne and what religion was best to be
folowed. At which solitary meditation of the prince this good
and godly bishoppe Pawline entred on a daye in to the palace,
and cominge to the kinge, laied his right hand on his heade
and asked hym, whether he remembred that sygne, or no?
The king sodenly trembled therat for feare. And when he
wold haue fallen downe at Paulinus feate, the bishoppe lyfted
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
him vppe, and spake after a familiar sorte thus vnto him: Be∣hold
o Soueraine Prince, by the bountifull hand and powre of
our Lorde, and God, you haue eskaped the hande and vengean∣ce
of your moste hated, and dredfull enemie. Behold also, by
his most gratiouse goodnes you haue obtained the Souerain∣tie
of raigne, and rule of the kingdome. Remember now ther∣fore
the third thinge, which yowe promised him, and differ no
lenger to performe, and accomplishe the same, by receauing his
faithe, and keaping his commaundements, who hath deliuered
you from your temporall aduersities, and exalted you to the
honour, and maieste of a king. Whose holy will yf you will he∣reafter
obey and euer more doe his pleasure, which by me he
preacheth, and declareth to yowe, he will also deliuer you from
the perpetuall tormente of hell, and make you partakener
with him in heauen of eternall kingdome, and blesse without

that if these thinges which be now newly preched to vs
shalbe founde after good examination, the better, and of more
strenght, and stedfastnes, that then without longer delaye we
hasten to receiue, and embrace them. To this persuasion, of bis∣shop
Coyfi an other of the nobles consenting sayde by and by:
Suche semeth to me, dere Soueraine, the lyfe of men present
here in earthe (for the comparison of our vncertaine time, and
dayes to lyue) as if a sparowe beaten with winde, and wether
shuld chaunce to flie in at one windowe of the parlour, and flit∣ting
there a litle aboute, straight waye flye out at an other, whi∣le
your grace is at diner in the presence of your dukes, Lordes,
Capitaines, and high garde. The parloure it selfe being then
pleasaunt, and warme with a softe fyre burning amidest ther∣of,
but all places, and waies abrode troubled withe tem∣peste,
raging stormes, winter windes, hayle, and snowe.
Nowe your grace considereth, that this sparrowe while it was
within the house felt no smart of tempesteouse winde or ray¦ne.
<PB N="67" REF="81"/>
But after the shorte space of this faire wether, and warme
ayre, the poore byrd escapeth your sight, and returneth from
winter to winter againe. So the life of man appeareth here in
earth, and is to be sene for a season: but what maye, or shall fo∣lowe
the same, or what hath gon before it, that surely knowe
we not. Therefore if this newe lerning can enfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me vs of
anie better suertie, my thinke it is worthie to be folowed.
Thus or in like manner sayd the rest of the elders, and the kin∣ges
counsellers, no doubte, by the holie inspiration of God.
Only bishop Coyfi was not content to rest him here, but sayd
moreouer that he would with diligēce note Pauline and mar∣ke
what he said of that God, whome he preached. Which thing
when he had so donne according to the kinges will, and plea∣sure,
he returned againe, and with a lowde voice sayde. I vn∣derstoode
certes longe a goe, that in verie dede, it was right
nought which we worshipped as God. For the more cu∣riously
that I sought for the trueth in worshipping our Godes,
certainly the farder was I from it, and the lesse I founde hit.
But now doe I plainly perceaue and knowe, that in this <HI>Paw∣linus</HI>
preaching and teaching is that trueth, and veritie, which
is able to geaue vs the greate giftes of life, of saluation, and of
blisse euerlastinge. Wherfore I counsell, and exhorte yowe my
most Soueraine and dere Prince, that we may out of hande
curse our temples and abandon them. And burne downe with
fyre our Idolatrous aulters. Which we haue heretofore erected
in vayne, and consecrated without all fruite, and profitte. But
that I maye be shorte, and come nere my purpose: the kinge
gaue his full, and plaine consent to this holye man bisshop
Pauline. Willing him to preache the gospell freely. And him∣selfe
renouncing there all idolatrie, promised that he would
receaue, and embrace the faith of Christe. And demaunding
then, of this before sayd Coifi, bishop of his sacrifices, who
should first profane the aulters, and destroye the temples of I∣dols,
<PB REF="82"/>
with all the grates, and barres wherwith they were enuy∣roned?
Marry (quoth he) I will. For who maye better then I,
which ons by folishnes worshipped, and highly estemed them?
Therefore to the good example of all other, I will now my sel∣fe
through the wisedome of God (that is one, only, and true
God) geauen vnto me, beate downe, and vtterly destroye the
abomination of our temples. So sorsaking in this wise all super∣stitiouse
custome, and vaine dreade, he besought the king to
graunte him harnesse, and armoure, and therewith a greate
courser, and mighty couragious stalyon horse. On which he
mounted lustely, and with all spede rode forth to batter, and
beate downe to grounde the idols. Now was it not laufull for
a bishop of the sacrifices either to were harnesse, and armoure,
or to ride on other then a mare. But Coyfi made smalle com∣pte
thereof. For being alredie well harnessed, and strongly gir∣ded
with a swerd about his loynes, sitting fast on the kinges
courser and stought stalyon, he tooke also in his hand a speare,
and so did marche and sette fourthe against the pernitiouse
idols. Which sight when the people sawe, they thought he had
ben madde. Yet he for all that staied not. But as sone as he ap∣proched
nere the tēple, profaned it, casting thereon the speare,
which he held in his hand, and muche reioysing now, bycause
he knew the true worshipping of God, commaunded the com∣panie
which was there with him to destroye the temple, to fyre
the idolatrouse aulters, and breake the barres, grates, or whatso∣euer
ornamentes were theraboute. And truly the place where
those Idols sometime were, is now to be seene, not far from
Yorke at the ryfing of the riuer Derwent. And is at this present
day called Gormund in Gaham. In which place, the bishop
Coyfi by holy inspiratiō of the true God, polluted, and destro∣yed
the aulters of false Goddes, which himselfe before had so∣lemly
consecrated.</P>

feerce and barbarouse, thē was any heathen, or paynim. For
kinge Penda with all the nation of the Marshland men was
wholly geauen to Idolatrie, and altogether heathen, and vn∣christened.
But king Cardwell althowgh he had the name of

But the realme of the Bernicians (for the nation of Northum∣berland
had been deuided of olde time into these two coun∣tries)
was ruled by Edelfrides sonne, named Eanfride, who had
of that prouince the beginning of his kinred and kingdome.
For during all the time of Edwines raigne the sonnes of kin∣ge
Edelfride, who (as we saied before) raigned before Ed∣win,
were banished with a greate numbre of noble young gen∣till

thei wold send him a prelate, by whose doctrine and ministerie
the realme of Englād which he ruled might both learne the gi∣ftes,
and also receiue the sacramēts of our Lordes faith. Neither
was this godly request denied him. For bishop Aidan was direc∣ted
straight vnto him, a mā of maruailous mekenesse, godlines∣se,
and modestie: and one that had a zele in Gods quarrell, al∣though
not in euery point according to knouledg. For he was
wont to kepe Easter sunday from the fourtenth day after the
chaūge of the mone, vntil the twētith: according to the custo∣me
of his country, wherof we haue diuers times made menciō.
For the north part of Scotlād, and al the Redshanks did in that
maner euen at the same time solemnise Easter sunday, thin∣king
that in this keeping of Easter they folowed the aduer∣tisement
writen by the holy praise worthy father <HI>Anatholius</HI>
<PB REF="93"/>
which how well it was done of them, the skilfull in Christen
religion are not ignorant. Truly the Scottes, which dwelt in
the southe coastes of the yle of Ireland, had long a gone lear∣ned
to keepe the fest of Easter by the Canonicall approued
custome, being aduised thereto by the Pope sitting in the see
Apostolike. To this bishop Aidan king Oswald appointed
holye Ilond for his see and bishoprick, according as he had
him selfe desyred.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy Ilond.</NOTE> This place with flowing and ebbing is

muche enlarged the Church of Christe throughe his domi∣nions.
And in this most godly endeuour bothe of the Prince
and of the bishop this was a gracious and pleasaunt sight, that
whereas the bishop was vnskillfull of the English tonge, and
the kinge by reason of his longe banishement in Scotland,
vnderstode and spake the scottish very well, when the bis∣shop
preached the faith of Christ, the king was interpreter
of the heauenly worde to his dukes and subiectes. Hereupon
for the space of a longe time people flocked out of Scotland
into Britaine, and such as were called to the high degree of
priesthod, began with great and feruent deuotion to prea∣che
the worde of faith to those prouinces of England, which
king Oswalde gouerned, baptising all such as beleued. There∣fore
churches wer builded in places conuenient: the people re∣ioycing
assembled together to heare the woord of God, pos∣sessions
and territories wer geuen by the kinges bountifulnesse
for the foundation of religiouse houses: the litle children of
England and elder folkes wer by the Scottes their instru∣ctours
trained and traded vp in obseruation of regular dis∣cipline.
For they wer for the most parte mōkes all such as came

yle which is called Hydestinate. The house of his religion
was no small time the head house of all the monasteries al∣most
of the northren Scottes and of abbyes of all the Red∣shankes
and had the soueraintie in ruling of their people,
Which yle in very deede belongeth to the right of Britaine,
being seuered from it with a narow sea: but by the free gifte

came to Britanie when the most puissaunt king <HI>Bride Meilo∣cheus</HI>
sonne raigned ouer the Redshanks, in the ninth yere of
his raigne, and did by his learning and example of life conuert
that nacion to the faith of Christ. In consideration whereof
the aforsay de yle was geuen him in possessiō, to make a mona∣sterie.
For the yle is not greate, but as though it wer of fiue fa∣milies
by estimatiō. His successours kepe it vntil this day, wher
also he lieth buried dying at the age of lxxvij. yeres, about xxxij.
yeres after that he cam into Britain to preach. But befor that he
trauailed to Britaine, he made a famous monasterie in Irelād
whiche for the great store of okes is in the Scottish tong called
<HI>Dearmach,</HI> that is to say, a fild of okes: of both the which mona∣steries
very many mo religious houses were afterward erected
by his scholars both in Britaine, and also in Ireland. Of all the
which the same abbey that is in the yle where in his bodye
lieth buried, is the head house. This yle is alwayes wont to haue
an Abbat that is a priest, to be the ruler: to whō both the wholle
countrey and also the bishops them selfes ought after a straūge
and vncustomed order to be subiect, according to the example
of the first teacher, who was no bishop, but a priest and a mon∣ke.
The report is, that some things ar written by his scholars cō∣cerning
his lyfe and sayings: but yet what maner of man so e∣uer
he was, we know this of him for a surety, that he left suc∣cessours,
men that excelled in great continence, in passing cha∣rite,
and vertuous trade of religious lyfe. In obseruing the
high feast of Easter they trusted to vncertaine compasses,
and no maruaile consydering that no man sent vnto them, the
decrees made in generall counsayles for the keping there∣of.
Yet they diligently obserued all such workes of deuotion
and chast conuersation as they could learne in the prophets, in
<PB N="80" REF="94"/>
the ghospels, and the Apostles writings. This keping of Easter
continued no small time with them, that is to witt, vntill the
seuen hundreth and sixteneth yere of our Lordes incarnation,
by the space of an hundreth and fiftie yeres after, they receiued
the faith. But when the right reuerend and holy father and
priest Egbert came to them from England, liuing in Christes
quarell in exile in Ireland, being a man very well learned in
the holy scripture and singular for the perfett lyfe, which he
had lead many yeres together, they were reformed by him, and
brought to kepe Easter on the true right and laufull day. Ne∣uerthelesse
they did not alway before that time solemnise and
keepe the feast of Easter vppon the fourtenth daye after the
chaunge of the moone according to the Iewes custome (as so∣me
men supposed) but on the same day, though in an other we∣ke
then it was conuenient. For they knewe (as Christen men
do) that the resurrection of our Lorde, whiche was on the
firste daye of the weke ought allwayes to be celebrated on
the first daye of the weke also: but as ignoraunt and high∣vplandysh
men they had not learned when the same first daye
of the weke whiche nowe is named Sounday shoulde come.
Yet for as muche as they continued in perfecte charitye, they
deserued to attaine the perfitte knowledg of this thing, ac∣cording
as the Apostle promiseth saying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 2.</NOTE> <HI>And yff ye be off

<P>FROM this yle therefore and from this co∣uent
of monkes founded by holy Colum∣ban,
Aidan was sent and consecrated bishop
to instructe Englande in the fayth of CHRI∣STE,
at what tyme Segenius abbot and priest
<PB REF="95"/>
was head of the same monasterie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exā∣ple of a true prea∣cher, and avertuous Bishop.</NOTE> Wherein among other les∣sons
of liuing he left the Clerkes a most holsome example of
abstinence, and continence. This thing did chiefely com∣mend
his doctrine to all men, that the learning whiche he
taught was correspondent to the life that he lead. And why?
He was not desyrous after wordly goods, he was not ena∣moured
with present Vanitees. His ioye and comforte was
foorthwyth to distribute to the poore that mette him all that
was geuen him of kinges or other wealthy men of the worl∣de.
He vsed to trauayle continually bothe in the citye
and in the countrey, neuer on horse backe, but allwayes
on foote, except peraduenture greate neede had forced him
to ryde. And in his trauaile what dyd he? Forsoothe who∣me
so euer he mette, riche or poore, incontinent abyding
for a time with them, either he allured them to receiue the
faythe if they were out of the faythe, or strengthened them in
the faythe, if they were in it, exhorting them eftsoones no les∣se
in workes then wordes to almesse geuing and other good
deedes. And his religious lyfe so farre passed the slackenes
and key colde deuotion of oure time, that all they whiche
went with him, were they professed into religion, or were
they laye brethern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siue adiōsi siue Laici.</NOTE> gaue them selfes continually to contem∣plation,
that is to saye, bestowed all their tyme either in rea∣ding
scripture, or in learning the psalter. This was the dayly ex∣ercise
of him and his brethren to what place so euer they came.
And if by chaunce it had happenned (whiche yet happened
seldome) that he were bidden to the kinges banket, he went in
accompained with one or two clerkes, and taking a shorte re∣past,
he made spedely hast to read with his brethren, or els wēt
other where forth to pray. Euery deuout mā and womā being
at that time taught by his ensamples tooke vp a custome al the

three of the clocke in the after none. If rych men had done any
thing amysse, he neuer for hope of honour, or feare of displea∣sure
spared to tel them of it, but with sharpe rebuking amended
them. If any gesse or straunger had come vnto him, were he
neuer so worshipful, he neuer gaue mony but only made them
good chere. As for suche gyftes as in monye were liberally
geuen him by ryche men, he dyd eyther (as we haue sayed)
geue them in a dole for the reliefe of the poore, or els he la∣yed it
out for the raunsomyng of those that had been wrong∣fully
solde: finally many of such, as by mony he had redemed,
he made after his scholers, bringing them vpp in learning and
vertue and exalting them to the highe dignite of priesthod.
The report is that (when kynge Oswald desired first to haue
a Prelate out of Scotland, who might preach the fayth to him
and his people) an other man of a more austere stomacke was
first sent: Who when after a lyttell while preaching to the
Englishe nacion, he did nothing preuaile ne yet was wyllingly
heard of the people, he returned into his country, and in the
assemble of the elders, he made relacion, how that in teaching
he could do the people no good to the which he was sent, for
as much as they were folkes that might not be reclaymed, of a
hard capacite, and fierce nature. Then the elders (as they say)
began in counsaile to treate at lōge what were best to de done,
being no lesse desyrous that the people should attayne the sal∣uation
whiche they sought for, then sory, that the preacher
whom they sent, was not receiued. When Aidan (for he also
was present at the coūsaile) replyed against the priest of whom
I spake, saying. Me thinketh brother, that you haue ben more
rigorous, then reason would with that vnlerned audience, and
that you haue not according to the Apostles instruction, first
geuen them milke of milde doctrine, vntell being by litle and
litle nourished and weaned with the worde of God, they were
able to vnderstand the more perfect misteries, and fulfill the
<PB REF="96"/>
greater commaundementes of God. This being saied, al that
were at the assemble, looking vpon Aidan debated diligently
his saying, and concluded that he aboue the rest was worthy of
that charge and bishopricke, and that he shoulde be sent to in∣struct
those vnlerned paynims. For he was tried to be chiefely
garnished with the grace of discretion, the mother of all ver∣tues.
Thus making him bishop they sent him forthe to preach.
Who when he had taken his time, euen as before he was kno∣wen
to be endued withe discretion, so did he afterward shewe
him selfe to be beautified with all other vertues.</P>

in his presence that he wold sowe the seedes of the holy

no teacher had of any time gone before him. In consideration
wherof at the commaundement of the same Pope <HI>Asterius</HI>
the bishop of Geane did consecrat him bishop. But at his arri∣uall
<PB REF="97"/>
into Britany, and first entering into <HI>Geuisse,</HI> finding that al
the inhabitants there were very paynims, he thought it more
expedient, to preach the word of God among them, rather then
in trauailing further to serche for such as he shuld preach vnto.
And thus at his preaching of the gospell in the forsaid prouin∣ce,
when the king him selfe being newly taught the faith was
Christened with his nation, it happened at that tyme, that Os∣wald
the most holy and very victorious king of Northumber∣land
was present.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Christe∣ning in the west co∣untre.</NOTE> Who coming then to take his daughter to

succeded him in his kingdome:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apostasie from the faith pu∣nished.</NOTE> who refused to receiue the

an other wife, and casting of the sister of Penda kinge of
the Marshes his true wedded wif, he was by Penda assauted with
battaile, deposed from his kingdome, and constrained to flye
to the king of the east English men, who was called <HI>Anna,</HI>
with whom liuing in banishment by the space of three ye∣res
he learned the faith. For this kinge with whom he lyued in
banishment, was a vertuous man and blessed of God with plen∣tifull

Senwalch was restored to his kingdome, there came out of Ire∣lande
into his prouince a certaine prelate named <HI>Agilbertus,</HI> a

came to serue the prince and to preach him the word of

him to remaine with him, enduing him with a bishoprik in his
dominions which at the princes request he accepted, and ruled
the same people many yeres with priestly authoritie. At the

wery of that foren language that <HI>Agilbertus</HI> vsed, did priuely
bring into the prouince an other bishop of his owne language,
named <HI>VVini,</HI> the which also was made bishop in fraunce. And

there he died an old man, and very aged. But not many yeres af¦ter
his departure out of Britāny Wini also was by the same king
deposed from his bishoprike, frō whēce he departed to the king
of the Marshes called Vulfhere, and of him he bought with mo∣ny
the see of the cite of Londō and cōtinued there bishopto the
end of his lif. Wherby the prouince of the west Saxōs lacked no

Saxons being very often disquieted in his mind for the great

she began in her monastery to build a church in the honour of
all the Apostles wherein she willed her body to be buried. But
the worke being wel nere half done she died, and was buried in
that very place of the church, (though yet not finished) where
she desyred. After whose death the Brethren more inten∣ding

of Christian kinges, neither any yere of their raigne regestred.
At the full end of these nine yeres <HI>Oswald</HI> was slayne in the

king of the Marshes, by whom also his predecessour Edw∣yne
was killed, in a place whiche in the English tong is called
<HI>Maserfelth,</HI> in the eight and thirtith yere of his age, on the first

the death of this prince it fortuned a man on horsebacke to

at the length, after great and excessiue payne to fal down right:
the man lighted of, and laying some strawe vnder his horse, ta∣ryed
by to see whether the horse would mend or els dye ow∣tright.
The poore beast being of long tyme troubled withe
greauous paine, toumbling and turning it selfe nowe on the
one side, nowe on the other, walowed at the length to that
same place, where this kinge of worthy memorie was slayne.
Incontinent the paine ceasing, the horse leaft the inordinat
motions of his body, turning it selfe as if it had ben wery on
the other side, and foorth with as perfitly whole on bothe sides
arose vp and began to grase: at the sight wherof the owner of
the horse, as a man of a quick witt, vnderstoode that some stra∣unge
and singular holinesse, was in that place where his horse
was vpon the soden so healed. Putting therfore a marke in the
place, he leapt on horseback, and rode to the ynne, whither he
purposed to trauaile. Here he found a damsell neece to the
good man of the house of a long time deseased with a greuous
palsey, whereof hearing his ofte and the whole house holde
much complayning, he began to tell them of the place where
his horse was healed. What nede many wordes? They set her
on a carte, and brought her to that place, laying her downe
therin. Wher hauing rested and slept for a small tyme, wa∣king

<P>AT that tyme a certayne other trauailer came out of Bri∣taine,
as the brute is making his iourney ner to that same
place, wherin the forsaid battaile was fought. Vewing the
place he espied one plat more greene and pleasanter to the eye
then was the residue of the field. Wherof he gessed the cause
should be that in that place some one man holyer then the rest
of the armie had ben slayne. Therfore he toke awaie withe
him some of the dust of that earth, knitting it vp in a lynnen
cloth, and demyng with him selue, as in dede it came after to

This man ryding on his iourney came that euening to
a certaine village, where taking vpp his inne, and finding the
neighbours of the parish at feast with the ofte, being required
sate down also with thē at the banket hanging vpon on of the

</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The. 11. Chapter.</HEAD>
<P>OF all other miracles I suppose it must in no wise be left
vnwritten, how heauenly a miracle was shewed when
king Oswalds bones were found out, and translated to
the church wherin they are now reserued. This was done by the
industry of the queene of the Marshes, Offride by name, who
was his brother Oswines daughter which Oswin after Oswalds
raigne came to the croune, as we shall declare in the processe
that foloweth. Ther is a famous monastery in the prouince
<HI>Lindissi</HI> named <HI>Beardanan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lincoi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eshere.</NOTE> which the same quene and her hus∣band
Adilrede did greatly loue, honour, and reuerence, wherin
she desyred to lay vp her vncles honorable bones. When the
chariot was come, wherin the same bones were brought toward
the euening, the men that were in the monastery, would not
gladly receiue these bones, into the forsaid monastery: because
although they had knowen that he was a blessed man, not∣withstanding
forasmuch as he was a forrain borne, and toke
vpon him to be their king, they hated him also after his death,
like as they did of long time by his lyfe. Wherby it came to pas∣se,
that, that same night the relikes that were brought thither,
did remaine still without: yet was there a great pauilion stret∣ched
out ouer the chariot wherin the relikes were: but the she∣wing
of heauenly miracle did manifestly declare, with how
great reuerence those bones ought to be receiued of all faith
full people. For all that night long a pillour of light, reaching
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
from that chariot vnto he auen, stoode so, that it was plainly
seen in al places almost of the same prouince of <HI>Lindisse.</HI> Wher∣fore
when the morning was come, the brethern of that mona∣stery,
who on the day before had denied began now to desyre
earnestly, that the same holy relikes, might be laied vp in their
house. These bones were after enclosed in a shrine, which they
had prouided for that purpose. The shrine also was placed in
the church with honour conuenient: And to thend that the
holy mans princely personage might alwaie be remembred,
they erected ouer his tūbe his standerd, made of gold and pur∣ple:
Also whereas the very water wherin they washed his bo∣nes,
they poored out into a corner of the vestrey, from that day
forward it came to passe, that the earth it selfe, which receiued
that holy washing, had also especiall grace to driue awaie diuels
from the bodies that were possessed. Furthermore in processe
of time, when the forsaide Quene abode in the same monaste∣ry
there came to salute her a certaine honorable Abbesse, which liueth vntill this day: her name is <HI>Edilhild</HI> sister to the blessed
man <HI>Edelwin</HI> and <HI>Aldewin,</HI> the first of the which was a bishop
in the prouince <HI>Lindisse,</HI> the second was the Abbot of a mona∣stery,
the which is called <HI>Peartane</HI> not far from the place where
that Abbesse had her monastery. This abbesse cōmoning with
the Quene, after they begā to fal in talke of Oswalde, among o∣ther
matters she saied, that she also had seene, on the very same
night a light vpon his relikes whiche in height reached vp to
heauen. Wherunto the Quene added that many sicke folckes
were now healed with the very dust of the pauiment, on the
which the water of his wasshing was poured out: Then the Ab∣besse
desyred to haue some deale, of the dust geuen her, and as
sone as she receiued it, she knit it vp in a cloth, laied it vp in a lit∣le
casket, and retourned. Not longe after, when she was
in her owne monastery, a certaine straunger came thither,
who in the night was wonte diuers times sodenly to be trou∣bled
<PB REF="102"/>
with a foule sprite, and that most greuously. This geste
when he had ben liberally entertayned, after supper went to
bedd, and sodenly being possessed with the diuell, began to crye
out, to gnash with his teeth, to fome at the mouth, and to cast
fourth his body violently, flinging some partes one waye, and
some an other. And when no man was able either to hold or
to binde him, a seruant ranne, and knocking at the gate tol∣de
the abbesse. Who forth with going forth with one of the
nunnes, to the place where the brethern laye, she called forth a
priest, requiring him to go with her to the pacient. Wher when
at their coming they sawe many men present, labouring to ke∣pe
downe the partty vexed, and to stay his inordinat motions
and yet preuailing nothing, the priest adiured hym, and

possessed with the euill sprit, was tormented) bringing the sai∣de

downe his head, as though he were fallen a sleape: setting eue∣ry

Then did the Abbesse geue him a litle piece of that

destroyed Britayne, and Ireland, a certayne scholer whose
auncetours were scottes, was stroken with the same pestilence,
a man skilfull certesse in the studye of learning, but one that
vsed no diligence, and tooke no labour at all for the attayning

to be at deaths doore, trembled and was troubled in sprite, for
death so nye approching, fearing, (as his lewde life deserued)
to be throwen down into the doungeon of hell. And therwith
he cryed to me being lodged not far of, and fetching depe and
sorowfull sighes, in a trembling and lamentable voyce, made

that for his outward personage, inward hart, and prince∣ly

all countres frequented his court, and coueted to be receiued
in his seruice. Amonge other his rare vertues, and princely qua∣lites,
his humilitie and passing lowlynesse excelled. Wherof we
wil be contented to recite one most worthy example. He had
geuen to bishop <HI>Aidan</HI> a very faire and proper gelding: which
that vertuous bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop And an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ero S. Martin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who ga∣ue halfe his doke to a na∣ked poo∣re man.</NOTE> (though he vsed most to trauail on foo∣te)
might vse to passe ouer waters and ditches, or when any

poore weake man met the bishop, riding on his gelding, and
craued an almes of him. The bishop as he was a passing pite∣full
man, and a very father to needy persons, lighted of, and ga∣ue
the poore man the gelding gorgeously trapped as he was.
The king hearing after hereof, talked of it with the bishop, as
they were entring the palace to diner and saied. What meaned
you my Lord to geue awaie to the begger that faire gelding,
which we gaue you for your owne vse? Haue we no other
horses of lesse price, and other kinde of rewardes to bestowe
vpon the poore, but that you must geaue awaie that princely
horse, which we gaue you for your owne ryding? To whom
the bishop answered. Why talketh your grace thus?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A chari∣table say∣ing, but now mo∣re like to be moc∣ked at, then to be folo∣wed</NOTE> Is that

bishop toke his place appointed. But the knge coming then

from hunting, would stand a while by the fyre to warme him.
Where standing and musing with himselfe vpon the wordes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rare and strā∣ge humi∣lite of a kinge.</NOTE>
which the bishop had spoken vnto him, sodenly put of his
sworde geuing it to his seruant, and came in greate hast to the
bishop, falling downe at his feete, and beseching him not to be
displeased with him for the wordes he had spoken vnto him,
saying he would neuer more speake of it, nor measure any mo∣re
hereafter what or how much he should bestow of his goods
vpon the sonnes of God, the poore. At which sight the bishop
being much astonned, arose sodenly and lifted vp the king tel∣ling
him that he should quickely be pleased, yf it would please
him to fitt downe, and cast awaie al heauynesse. Afterward the
kinge being at the bishops request mery, the bishop contrary
wise began to be heauy and sory in such sorte, that the teares
trickled downe by his chekes. Of whom when his chapleyne
in his mother tonge, which the king and his court vnderstoo∣de
not, had demanded why he wept: I know said he, that the
king shall not lyue long. For neuer before this time haue I seen
an humble king. Wherby I perceiue, that he shall spedely be ta∣ken
out of this life, for this people is not worthy to haue such
a prince and gouernour. Shortly after the bishops dredful abo∣dement
was fullfilled with the kinges cruel death, as we haue
before declared. Bishop <HI>Aidan</HI> him self also was taken awaie
out of this world and receiued of God the euerlasting rewar∣des
of his labours euen on the twelfthe day after the kinge,

recite, for remembraunces sake. A certaine priest called Vtta <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
man of great grauitye and truth, and one that for his qualites
was much reuerenced and estemed of men of honour, at what
time he was sent into kent to fetch Eanflede kinge Edwines
daughter, who after the death of her father had ben sent thi∣ther,
to be maried to king Oswin, appointing so his iourney,
that he minded to trauail thither by land, but to retourne with
the yoūg lady by water, he wēt to bishop <HI>Aidā</HI> beseching him
to make his humble prayers to god to prosper him and his,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deuo¦tiō of our primitiue church.</NOTE>
who were then taking their iourney. The bishop blessing them
and committing them to the goodnes of god, gaue them also
hallowed oyle, saying: I know that when you shall haue ship∣ping,
a tempest and a contrary winde shall rise vpon you sode∣inly.
But remember that you cast into the sea, this oyle that I
geue you, and anon the winde being laied, comfortable fayer
weather shall ensue on the sea, which shall send you home aga∣ine
with as pleasaunt a passage as you haue wished. All these
thinges were fulfilled in order, as the bishop prophesied. Truly
at the beginning of the tempest, when the waues and surges of
the sea did chiefely rage, the shipmen assayed to cast ancar, but
all in vaine. For the tempest encreased, the whaues multi∣plied
so faste, and water so filled the shippe, that nothing but
present death was looked for. In this distresse the priest at the
length remembring the bishop wordes, toke the oyle pot, and
did cast of the oyle into the sea, which being done (according
as the vertuous bishop had forsaide) the sea calmed, the bright
sonne appeared, the ship passed on with a most prosperous vi∣age.
Thus the man of God by the sprit of prophecy, forshewed
the tempest to come, and by the same holy Spirit, though bo∣dely
absent appaised the same. No common reporter of vn∣certain

<P>THis vertuous bishop <HI>Aidanus</HI> at what tyme he shoulde

a chamber, he vsed oftentimes to stay and abyde there taking

the word of God, as he did in al other tounes subiect to the kin∣ge,
not resting longe in any place as hauing no possessions of
his owne, but his church only and a small plotte of grounde
lying there aboute. Being therfore sicke, they pitched him a pa∣uilion,
fastening it hard to the church wall, on the west syde
thereof. In this pauilion leaning to a post ioyned to the out
side of the church to fortefy it, he gaue vp the ghost in the
xvij. yere of his bishopricke, the last day of August. His body
was from thence caryed to <HI>holy Iland,</HI> and in the church yarde
of the monastery buried. But shortly after a greater church the∣re
being erected, and dedicated in the honour of the most bles∣sed
prince of the Apostles S. Peter, his bones were transposed
thither, and layed at the right side of the aultar, with much ho∣nour

him his wronge and euill accustomed obseruation of Easter
according to the coūte of the Iewes, but detesting that in hym
vtterly, as also I haue euidently declared in my booke <HI>De tem∣poribus.</HI>
But as it behoueth a true historiographer, I haue re∣ported
of him and of his doings, suche thinges as were cōmen∣dable,
and might profit the readers. As that he was a man of
greate charity and quyet, of great contynency and humilitie, a
conquerer of wrathe and couuetousnes and one that was far
from all pride and vaine glory. Againe I commend in him
his greatindustry both in keping and in teaching the comma∣undements
of God, his diligent reading, continuall watching,
his priestly grauitye in rebuking the proude and haughty, and
mild demeanour in comforting the weake, and refreshing the
nedy. And to be short, I commend him as one that laboured all
dayes of his life (as of his most nere acquaintance I vnderstād)
to obserue and fulfill all that was writen and commaunded in
holy scriptures the Prophets and Apostles. These thinges in
<PB REF="108"/>
that holy prelate I do much embrace and commend, as things
vndoubtedly pleasing almighty God. But that he obserued
not Easter in his due time, either as ignorant therof, or witting
it well, yet being lead with the authoritye of his countre, not
acknowleadging it, this I neither commend nor allowe. Yet
in this very point this I allowe in him, that in his manner of
obseruing Easter he beleued, reuerenced, and preached no o∣ther
thing, then we doe, that is the redemption of mankynde
by the passion, resurrection and ascension of <HI>Christ Iesus</HI> the
mediatour betwene God and man. And therfore he obserued
his Easter not (as many falsely do suppose) altogether with the
Iewes, that is the fourtenth day of the moone, what so ever day
it fell vpon, but he kept it euer vpon a sonday reakoning from
the fourtenth day of the moone to the twentith: and that for
the faith vndoubtedly which he had in our lordes resurrectiō,
beleuing it to be in the first fery after the sabooth day in hope
of our resurrection to come, which the holy churche beleueth
shall happen vpon the same first fery, that is vpon a Sonday,

a man notable bothe for his sayings and doings, of

vp the monastery in the place kinge <HI>Sigibert</HI> had geuen him,
and to instruct it with regular discipline. This monastery was
pleasaūtly situated for the woddes and sea adioyning, being e∣rected
in the village of Cnobherburg, and enriched afterward
by Anna kinge of that prouince and many other noble men,
with sundry faire houses and other ornaments. This Furseus
came of the noblest race of the Scottish nation, nobler yet of
minde, then of bloud. From the very time of his childehood, he
gaue him selfe to reading of holy scripture, and monastical
discipline. Especially, as it becōmeth holy and perfit men, what
soeuer he lerned to be acceptable to God, he was hoful and dili

In the which monastery being striken with sicknesse, he
was taken out of his body, as the booke writen of his life doth
sufficiently testifie. In the which traunce continuing from e∣uening
vntil the next morning, he was brought to the sight of

of the blessed company of heauen, but also beside great con∣flictes
of the wicked sprits, which very busely went about to
stoppe him of his iourney toward heauen with their often ac∣cusations,
auailing yet nought against him, the holy Angels

of the Angels who caried him to looke downe in to the

fyres, not farre distant one from the other Asking therefo∣re

those were the fyres which should burne and consume the

we all incurre when we do not fulfill the promis which we
made in baptim: that is, to renoūnce the diuell and all his workes

the mindes of our euen Christiās, euen in trifling and su∣perfluous

thinking it a light matter to injury, beguile or vse violence to∣ward
our wekers and inferiours. These foure fyres encreasing
by litle and litle so farr at the lenght extended, that ioyning
altogether they grew to a great and houghly flame. Which

flyeng through the fire, fighting with fire against the Iuste. Af∣ter
folow the accusations of the wicked sprits against him, the
defence of the Angels for him, and a greater sight of the hea∣uenly
company. Amonge the which many of his owne nation
of Scotland appeared, vertuous priestes in their life time, and
men of great opinion of holynesse, of whom he lerned diuers
thinges very profitable both for him selfe and for other, which
would lerne of him. Who after they had ended their cōmuni∣cation
departing vp to heauen again with the other blessed
company, thre Angels remained with <HI>Furseus</HI> to reduce him a∣gaine
to his body. In their returne, as they approched to that

holy Angell taking away spedely the tormented soule, threw
him againe in to the fyre. Whereat the wicked sprit saied, repell
him not now whom ye receiued before. For as ye tooke the
goods of this sinner, so ought ye also take parte of his paynes
and tormentes. Vnto whom the Angell answering, saied, he to∣ke
it not of couetousnes, but for the sauing of his soule: with
this the fire ceased. And the Angel turning to the mā, said. That
which thou hast kindled hath now burned in the. For if thou
haddest not taken the mony of this man dying in his sinne, the
torment of his fire had not touched the. And here in many
wordes the Angell taught him, what was to be done concer∣ning
their saluation which did repent. The man liuing longe
time after, bore the signe of that fire which he suffred in soule,
visible and euident to all men in his shoulder and cheke. And
the flesh maruailously openly shewed that, which the soule pri∣uely
suffred. He endeuoured euer after, as he was also wont be∣fore,
to preache bothe by worde and example to all men the
trade and duty of a vertuous life. The maner of his visions
he communicated only to such, who of vertuous desire and
holy zele desired the same.</P>
<P>It remaineth yet (touching this man) that we recite here the
credible reporte of an auncient brother, of our monastery, who
saieth he heard of a very trusty and vertuous man, that he had
sene this <HI>Furseus</HI> in the prouince of the East costes of England,
and had heard of his owne mouth these visions. Reporting
moreouer, that in the most sharp frost of depe winter, that holy
man sitting but in a slight garment, as he recounted these vi∣sions,
through the great feare, and pleasure also conceiued by
the remembraunce thereof, he would sweat as if it had ben the
<PB REF="111"/>
hottest daye in the middest of sommer.</P>
<P>To returne to our principall purpose, this holy man hauing
preached the worde of God many yeares in Scotlande, and not
being able to endure any longer the commotion of the people,
leauing all that he had, departed from his natiue countre and I∣lond
that he was borne in. From thence he came to the easte
coast of England, preaching there the worde of God, and ere∣cting
at last (as we touched before) a noble Monastery. Al whi∣che
thinges duly perfourmed, intending vtterly to abandonne
all worldly cares and troubles, he leste also the busy gouuerne∣ment
of the monastery committing that charge of soules to
his brother <HI>Fullanus</HI> and to <HI>Gobbanus</HI> and <HI>Dicullus</HI> priestes: ta∣king
vpō him the most solitary life of an Anchoret. He had an
other brother called <HI>Vltanus</HI> who also after longe proufe and
triall in the monastery, went vnto a wildernesse and lead an
Eremites life. To him he went alone, liuing one whole yeare
with him in continency, prayers, and daily hand labour. The
countre being after much disquieted by often inuasions of en∣nemies,
and monasteries them selfes being in danger, leauing al
thinges in good order, he sailed in to Fraunce. Where being ho∣nourably
receiued of the French kinge Clouis the second, and
of Erkinwald then preuost of Perone he builded a monastery
in a place there called <HI>Latiniacum.</HI> Where not longe after fal∣ling
sicke he died. Whose body Earkinwald the preuost taking
thence kept it in the porche of his church vntell the church it
selfe was consecrated in Perone. Which being solemnely done
within six and twēty daies after the body was brought thither,
and being remoued from the porche to be layed by the high
aultar, it was founde as whole and vncorrupted as if the man
had but that houre departed. Foure yeares after a litle chappell
being erected at the east syde of the aultar wher the body shuld
more honourably betoumed, being takē vp againe to be trans∣posed
thither it was founde in like maner without any blemish
<PB N="97" REF="111"/>
of corruption. In the which place it is well knowen that his
merites haue much ben renowned by sundry miracles wrought
by the allmighty power of God. Thus much of the incorrup∣tion
of his body we haue brefely touched, that the reader might
more clerely vnderstande, of what excellency and vertu this
man was. All which thinges, and of other his vertuous com∣panyons
in the booke writen of his life, he that readeth, shall

he would as that countre was, receiue the Christen faith,

him. Who hearing the promis of euerlasting life, the hope of

to be Christned though he shoulde not spede of his suite.
To this he was muche persuaded by Alcfrid king Oswins son,

as would lerne and perfourme the will of their Creatour,

These and such other godly aduertissemtēs being frendly
and brotherly from time to time made and repeted to king

of kinge Oswin to haue with him some lerned men and prea∣chers
to conuert his countre to the faithe. Who sending for
Cedda and an other vertuous priest out of the midle land, di∣rected
them to the east Saxons to preache there the faith, Whe∣re
hauing through out the countre preached a longe time the
worde of life, and made vp a greate haruest to Christe,
Cedda departed home againe, and came to holy Iland to talke
with <HI>Finanus</HI> the bishop: who hearing the prosperous successe
of the ghospel and the free course it had, calling vnto him two

persons, as farre as their tender capacite could then con∣ceiue.
Thus when the heauenly discipline and holy deuotion
daily increased to the great ioye of the prince and the comfort
of all the people, beholde by the instinct of the olde enemy
of mankinde, this vertuous Prince by the handes of his owne
alliaūce was murthered. The cruel executours of this hainous
acte were two german brothers. Who being examined vpon
what motion they committed that detestable fact, they answe∣red,
for no other cause but for that they hated the prince for his
ouermuch elemency and mekenes in pardoning his enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vertu per secuted of the e∣uill, euen to death.</NOTE>
and forgeuing al offences done at the intreating of the parties.
This lo was their grudge conceiued against the kinge, for
which they murthered him: truly because deuoutely and since∣rely

asking pardon. The bishop being offended with the kinge (for
the euill example he gaue) touching him lying on the ground

<P>How the same Bisshop Cedda, obtaining a place to builde a mona∣stery of kinge Oswald, by fasting and praier did consecrat it to God: and of his death.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The 23. Chap.</HEAD>
<P>THis man of God Cedda being bishop of the east Sax∣ons,
vsed yet oftentimes to visit his owne countrie of
Northumberland and preache the gospell there. <HI>Edil∣wald</HI>
sonne to kinge Oswald who raigned in parte of Nort∣humberland,
ouer the people called <HI>Deiri,</HI> perceauing this bis∣shop
to be a holy, wise and vertuous man, required him to take
of his gift a piece of ground toward the building of a mona∣stery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The foun¦dation of monaste∣ries.</NOTE>
wherein he and his people might resort to heare the wor∣de
of God, to praie, and to bury their dead. For he beleued he
should much be comforted and holpen by their good prayers
who should in that place serue God. This kinge had in his hou∣se
<HI>Celin</HI> brother to bishop <HI>Cedda,</HI> a man of no lesse vertu, who
preached and ministred the sacramentes (for he was a priest) to
him and all his court. By whose meanes he came to the know∣leadg
of <HI>Cedda,</HI> and was induced to loue him. The holy bishop
at the kinges request, chose out a place to erect a monastery in
the high and desert mountaines. Where before that time we∣re
rather starting holes for theues or dennes for wilde bestes,
then mete mansion places for men. Hereby the prophecy of
Esaie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esaiae. 35.</NOTE> semed to be accomplished, saying, that <HI>in the poisonned cou∣ches
of dragons, swete grasse and rushes should growe,</HI> meaning that
<PB N="100" REF="114"/>
the frutes of good workes should blossom and springe, where
before bestes or men bestly liuing made their abode. This ver∣tuous
bishop desiring by prayer and fasting to purge as though
it were the place from the former filth of iniquites there com∣mitted,
and so to set vpon the foundation of the monastery,
obtained licence of the kinge all the Lent that then appro∣ched
to remaine in that place to fast and praie there after his
maner. In all which time, fasting euery daie, except the Sonda∣yes
vntell the euening,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fasting in Lent vn∣tell eue∣ning.</NOTE> as the maner is, he receiued then but a
litle bread with one egge, and a litle milke mingled with water.
For, as he saied, the custome of them of whom he lerned the
trade of monasticall life, was that in the new erecting of any
monastery or church, the places should be first consecrated<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consecra∣tion of holy pla∣ces.</NOTE> to
God with fasting and prayer. In this his fast, ten daies yet only
remaining of the fourty, the kinge sent for him vpon occasion
of certain affaires. But to the entent that so godly a purpose
might not be interrupted by occasion of the Princes busines,
though he brake of him selfe, yet he intreated <HI>Cinbellus</HI> his
priest and naturall brother, to make an ende of that he had be∣gonne.
Which being of him gladly and vertuously fulfilled, he
erected the monastery now called <HI>Lesting,</HI> geuing vnto it, the
same rules and order of religion as the monkes of <HI>Holy Iland</HI>
vsed, where he was brought vp in. Thus gouuerning both his
bishopricke and this monastery many yeares, at the length as
he visited the monastery in the time of a plage, falling sicke
there with other died. He was first buried abrode, but after a
church being there builded of stone in the honour of our La∣dy
he was taken vp and layed at the right side of the aultar. The
bishop at his departure left the monastery to be gouuerned of
his brother <HI>Ceadda,</HI> who after also was made bishop, as we shall
anon declare. For foure german brothers (which is a rare thin∣ge)
<HI>Cedd, Cymbill, Celin,</HI> and <HI>Ceadda</HI> wer al vertuous priestes, and
two of them bishops. When it was knowen in Northumberland
<PB REF="115"/>
that their bishop was dead and buried, thirty brethern of the
monastery which he erected amonge the east Saxons, came to
the place where he died. Desiring by the body of their father
either to liue, or (if it so pleased God) to die and be buried there.
Who being gladly receiued of the brethern, in that time of
mortalite,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intercessiō of Saints.</NOTE> were all taken out of this life, except one litle boye,
who (as it is well knowen) was saued by the praiers of the bis∣shop.
For liuing many yeares after, and studying holy scriptu∣re,
he lerned at lenght that he had not ben yet baptised. Where∣uppon
being forthwith christened, afterward was promoted to
priesthood, and proued a profitable member to the church. Of
whom we doubt not to pronounce but that (as I saied) he was
by the speciall intercession of that blessed bishop (whose bodye
of charite he came to visit) saued from the danger of death, bo∣the
that he might thereby escape eternall death, and might be
occasion also of life and saluation to other by his doctrine.</P>

which being saied he prepared him self to battaill with
a very small army. The army of the heathen is reported to
haue ben thirty tymes more in quantite, conteyning thirty
whole legions well appointed and gouuerned withe olde tried
and valiaunt capitaynes. Against all the which kinge Oswin
with his sonne marched forth boldely though with a very smal

therefore, and perfourming the vowe he had made, gaue
his daughter Elfled which was yet scant one yeare olde, to be

<P>IN the meane while after the death of <HI>Aidan Finā</HI> succeded
in the bishoprik of Northumberland, sent and consecrated
of the Scottes. Who in holy Iland builded a church mete
for a bishops see. Yet not of stone, but of oken tymber and
thatche worke, as the maner of Scottes was. This church after∣ward
the most reuerend father Theodore Archebishop of
Caunterbury dedicated in the honour of S. Peter the Apostle.
Eadbert also the bishop after of that place couered the churche
bothe the ruffe and the walles with lead. About this time a gre∣at
controuersy was moued touching the obseruation of Ea∣ster.
The bishops of Fraunce and kent affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cōtro∣uersic ab∣out theob seruatiō of Easter.</NOTE> that the Scot∣tes
obserued the Sonday of Easter contrary to the accustomed
maner of the vniuersall church. And amonge them one Ro∣man
a Scott borne but yet instructed in the truthe in Fraun∣ce
and Italie, and therefore an earnest and stoute defender of
the true obseruation of Easter. Who couplingand disputing
of this matter with <HI>Finanus</HI> the bishop, induced many to the
truthe, and enflamed other to a farder serche and examination
of the question, but with <HI>Finanus</HI> him self he could nothinge
preuaile, but rather exasperated him, being a hasty nature man,
and made him an open aduersary to the cause. Iames that reue∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent
deacō of tharchbishop <HI>Paulin,</HI> with al such as he cōuerted
to the faith, obserued the true and catholike time of Easter. <HI>Eā

obserued after the same maner according as she had sene
it practised in kēt, bringing with her one Romā out of kēt a ca¦tholike
priest. By this variaunce it happened oftētimes that in
one yere two Esters wer kept. As the king breaking vp his fast
and solēnising the feste of easter, the Quene with her cōpany
cotinued yet the fast, and kept palme Sūday. Yet this diuersite
of obseruing Easter, as longe as <HI>Aidan</HI> liued, was of all men
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
tolerated, knowing very well that though in obseruing easter
he folowed the custome of those with whom he was brought
vp, yet he beleued as al holy men did, and kept vnitie and loue,
with al. Vpon which consideration he was beloued of all men,
euen those which varied from him in that opinion and was
reuerenced not only of the meane and common sort, but also
of <HI>Honorius</HI> the Archebishop of Caunterbury and of <HI>Felix</HI> the
bishop of the east english. But after the death of <HI>Finanus,</HI> which
succeded him, <HI>Colman</HI> being made bishop sent also out of Scot∣land,
the controuersy began to increase, and other variaun∣ces
touching externall trade of life were stirred vp. By occasi∣on
wherof many begā to fear and doubt, lest bearing the name
of Christiās,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 2.</NOTE> <HI>they did rūne</HI> (as the Apostle saieth) <HI>or had runne in

to king <HI>Oswin</HI> and his sonne <HI>Alcfrid.</HI> For <HI>Oswin</HI> being brought
vp and baptised of the Scottes, and skilfull also of their tounge
thought the maner which they obserued to be the best and
most agreable to truthe. Contrary wise <HI>Alck frid,</HI> the kinges
sonne being instructed of the lerned man <HI>VVilfrid,</HI> preferred
worthely his iudgement before al the traditions of the Scottes.
This <HI>VVilfrid</HI> for better instruction and lerninges sake had
trauailed to Rome, and liued also a longe time with <HI>Dalphinus</HI>
the Archebishop of <HI>Lyons</HI> in Fraunce, of whom also he <HI>tooke
benet and collet.</HI> To this lerned Prince <HI>Alcfrid</HI> gaue a monaste∣ry
of fourty families, in a place which is called <HI>Humpum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tonsurae ecclesiasti∣caecoronā suscepe∣ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> The
Scottes before were in possessiō of that monastery: But bicause
after the decision of this controuersie they chose rather of
their owne accorde to departe and yelde vp the place, then to
chaunge their accustomed maner of obseruing the Easter, it
was geuen by the prince to him, who bothe for lerning and
vertu was worthy thereof. About this time <HI>Agilbert</HI> bishop of
the west saxōs, a frēde of Prince <HI>Alcfrid</HI> and <HI>VVilfrid</HI> the Ab∣bot
came to the prouince of Northumberland, and staied there
<PB REF="118"/>
with them for a space. Who in the meane while at the request
of <HI>Alc srid</HI> made <HI>VVilfride</HI> a priest. He had in his company al∣so
at that time one <HI>Agatho</HI> a priest. At their presence therfore
the question being renewed, and much talked of, they
agreed on bothe sides, that in the monasterie of <HI>Stranshalch</HI>
where that deuout and vertuous woman <HI>Hilda</HI> was Abbesse,
a Synod should be kept for the decidyng of this question, and
other then in controuersy. To this Synod came bothe the
kinges <HI>Oswin</HI> the father and <HI>Alcfrid</HI> the sonne. With king <HI>Os∣win</HI>
stode bishop <HI>Colman</HI> with his clergy of Scotland, <HI>Hilda</HI>
also the Abbesse with her company, among whom was <HI>Cedda</HI>
that reuerēt bishop lately consecrated of the Scottes (as we ha∣ue
touched before) who in that assemble was a most diligent
interpreter on both sides. For the other opinion which kinge
<HI>Alcfrid</HI> folowed, <HI>Agilbert</HI> the bishop stode, with <HI>Agatho</HI> and
<HI>VVilfrid</HI> priestes. <HI>Iacobus</HI> and also <HI>Romanus</HI> two other lerned
men stode of that side. First then kinge <HI>Oswin,</HI> (premising that
it behoued those which serued one God, to kepe one order and
rule in seruing the same, nor to vary here in celebrating the he∣auenly
sacramentes, who looked all for one kingdom in hea∣uen,
but rather that the truthe ought to be serched out of all,
and folowed vniformely of euery one) commaunded his bis∣shop
<HI>Colman</HI> first to declare what his obseruation was, whence
he receiued it, and whom he folowed therein. The bishop aun∣swered
and saied. The Easter which I obserue, I haue receiued
of my forefathers, of whom I was sent hether bishop, who all
being vertuous and godly men haue after the same maner ob∣serued
it. And this obseruation, that you maye not thinke it a
light matter or easely to be reiected, is the selfe same, which S.
Iohn the Euangelist the disciple whom Iesus specially loued
with all the churches vnder him obserued. These and such
like wordes when bishop Colman had spoken, the kinge com∣maunded
<HI>Agilbert</HI> the bishop to speake his minde also, and to
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
bringe forthe the beginning and author of his maner of ob∣seruing
Easter: vnto whom <HI>Agilbert</HI> answered: Let I bes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>che
you, my scholer <HI>VVilfrid</HI> priest speake herein for me. For we
and all that here sitt be of one minde, and obserue herein the
ecclesiasticall tradition vniformly. Beside he shal better expres∣se
to your highnes the whole matter speaking him selfe the en∣glish
tounge, then I shall be able vsing an interpreter. Then
<HI>VVilfrid,</HI> the kinge commaunding him, spake in this wise. The
Easter which we obserue, we haue sene in like maner to haue
ben obserued at Rome, where the blessed Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> and
<HI>Paule,</HI> liued, and preached, suffred, and are buried. This maner
we haue sene to be obserued in all Italy and Fraunce, passing
through those countres partly for study, partly on pilgrimage.
This maner we knowe to be obserued in <HI>Afrike,</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> in
<HI>Aegypt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vniuersa∣litie pre∣scribeth.</NOTE> in <HI>Grece,</HI> and through out all nations and tounges, of
all the worlde where the church of Christ taketh place, after
the self same order and time, beside only these fewe and other
of like obstinacy, the <HI>Pictes</HI> I meane and the <HI>Britons,</HI> with
whom these men from the two fardermost Ilondes of the Oceā
sea, and yet not all that neither, do fondly contend against the
whole worlde. Here <HI>Colmanus</HI> the bishop interrupted and saied.
I maruail much you terme our doing a fond contention whe∣rein
we folow the example of so worthy an Apostle, who only
leaued vpon our Lordes brest, and whose life and behauiour
all the worlde accompteth to haue ben most wise and discrete.
Vnto whom Wilfrid answered, and saied. God forbid we shuld
charge S. Iohn with fondnesse or lacke of wit. For he in his ob∣seruation
kept yet the decrees of Moyses lawe literally, accor∣ding
as the whole church folowed yet in many thinges the Iu∣ish
maner: for why? The Apostles were not able vpon the so∣den
to blotte out all customes and rites of the lawe instituted
of God him selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pri∣mitiue church at the firste did not abrogat all Iuish ceremo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies.</NOTE> as all that come to the faith must of neces∣site

<PB REF="119"/>
they were forced to beare a time withall, lest the Iewes
which liued amonge the gentils might be offended. For in the
like consideration also S. Paul did circumcide Timothe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actor. 16. 21. 18.</NOTE> offred
bloudsacrifices in the temple, shaued his head at Corinth with
<HI>Aquila</HI> and <HI>Priscilla:</HI> truly to no other intent, but that the Ie∣wes
might not be offended. Vpon this consideration Iames
saied vnto Paule. <HI>You see brother, how many thousandes of the Ie∣wes
haue receiued the faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 21.</NOTE> <HI>and all these are yet zelous folowers of the
lawe.</HI> Notwithstanding the light of the ghospell now shining
through out the worlde, it is not nowe necessary, no it is not
lawfull now for any Christen man to be circumcided, or to
offer vp bloudy sacrifices of bestes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o: 12.</NOTE> S. Iohn therefore according
to the custome of the lawe, in the fourtenth daie of the first
moneth at the euening began to celebrat the feste of Easter, not
regarding whether it fell out the Sabaoth daie or any other fe∣ry
of the weke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. 20.</NOTE> But S. Peter preaching the gospell at Rome, re∣membring
that our Lorde arose the first daye after the Sab∣baoth,
geuing thereby to vs certain and assured hope of our re∣surrection,
he vnderstode the obseruation of Easter in such
sorte, that according to the custome and commaundements of
the lawe he looked for (euen as S. Iohn did) the rising of the
Moone at euening, in the fourtenth day of his aage, in the first
moneth. And at the rising thereof at euening, if the morow af∣ter
were Sonday (which then was called, the first day after the
Sabboth) he began in that very euening to obserue the feste of
Easter, as all we do euen to this daye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This ma∣ner is ob∣serued no∣we vnifor mely in al Christen∣dome.</NOTE> <HI>beginning on Easter eue.</HI>
But if Sonday were not the next morow after the fourtenth
day of the chaunge of the Moone, but the sixtenth, seuenteth,
or any other daye of the Moone vntell the one and twentith,
he taryed for the Sonday, and the Saterday before vppon the
euening he began the most holy solemnite of Easter. Thus
it came to passe that Easter sonday was kept only either the
fiftenth day of the chaunge of the Moone in the first moneth,
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>
or the one and twentith, or in some daye betwene (as the son∣day
fell) and no daye elles.</P>
<P>Neither dothe this new obseruation of the ghospell and of
the Apostles breake the olde lawe, but rather fulfill it. For in
the lawe it is commaunded that the passeouer shoulde be so∣lemnised
from the euening of the xiiij.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12.</NOTE> daye of the chaunge of
the moone of the first moneth vntel the xxj. daye of the same
moone. Whiche obseruation all the successours of <HI>S. Iohn in
Asia</HI> after his death, and the whole vniuersall church through
out the whole worlde hath embraced and folowed. Againe it
was by the <HI>Nicene</HI> councell not newly decreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Russinus lib. 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> but confirmed
(as the ecclesiasticall history witnesseth) that this is the true
obseruation of Easter, and of all Christen men after this ac∣compt
to be celebrated. Whereby it is clere my Lord <HI>Colmā,</HI>
that you neither folowe the example of S. Iohn (as you sup∣pose)
neither of S. Peter, whose tradition wittingly you with∣stande,
nor the law, nor the ghospel in the obseruation of your
Easter. For <HI>S. Iohn</HI> obseruing the Easter time according to <MILESTONE N="1"/>
the lawes of <HI>Moyses,</HI> passed not vpon the Sonday, as you do,
which kepe your Easter allwaies vpon a Sonday. Againe <HI>S.<MILESTONE N="2"/>
Peter</HI> celebrated the Easter vpon the Sonday from the fiftenth
daye of the chaunge of the moone, vntell the xxj. daye, whiche
you folow not, which kepe it so vpon the Sonday, that you re∣aken
from the xiiij. daie of the chaunge vnto the xx. So that
oftentimes you beginne your Easter in the xiij. daie of the
change at euening, which neither the olde lawe obserued, nei∣ther
Christ in eating his passeouer, and instituting that moste <MILESTONE N="3"/>
holy Sacrament in remembraunce of his passion vsed, but on
the xiiij. daie. Againe the xxj. daye of the moone which the <MILESTONE N="4"/>
lawe expressely commaunded, you do vtterly exclude from the
celebrating of your Easter. Thus as I said, in the obseruation of
that most excellēt festiuite, you neither agree with <HI>S. Iohn,</HI> nei∣ther
with <HI>S. Peter,</HI> neither with the law, neither with the gospel.
<PB REF="120"/>
To these Bishopp <HI>Colman</HI> replied, and saied. How thinke ye?
Did <HI>Anatholius</HI> that holy man and so much commended in
the ecclesiasticall history before of you alleaged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eusab. lib. 7. cap. 28. Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o.</NOTE> thinke or te∣ache
contrary to the lawe and the ghospell, writing that Easter
ought to be obserued from the xiiij. daie of the moone vnto
the xx. Is it to be thought that our moste Reuerend Father
<HI>Columba</HI> and his successours, vertuous and godly men, who af∣ter
the same maner kept their Easter, either beleued or liued
contrary to holy Scripture? especially their holynesse being
such, that God hath confirmed it with miracles? Truly as I
doubt not but they were holy men, so I wil not feare to folow
allwaies their life, maners, and trade of discipline. In good so∣the,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Eus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bium lib. 7 cap. 28. His<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. eccle.</NOTE>
quoth <HI>VVillfrid,</HI> It is well knowen that <HI>Anatholius</HI> was a
right holy man, very well lerned, and worthy of much praise.
But what is that to you, who vary also from his decrees and
doctrine? For <HI>Anatholius</HI> in his Easter (according to the truth)
accompted the vsuall compasse of xix. yeres, whiche you either
vtterly are ignorant of, or if ye know it, yet though it be thro∣ugh
all Christendom obserued, ye sett light by it. Againe
thoughe he obserued the Easter Sonday sometime vpon the
xiiij. daye of the moone, yet he accompted the same daye at
euening to be the fiftenth of the chaunge, after the accompt of
the Aegyptians. So vpon the xx. daye he kept the Easter, that
at the sonne setting, he reaconed it for the xxj. Which his rule
and distinction, that ye be ignorant of, it is manifest by this,
that same time ye kepe your Easter cleane before the full of the
moone, euen the xiij. daye of the chaunge. As touching your
father <HI>Columba</HI> and those whiche folowed him, whose holy
steppes ye pretend to folow, as the which haue ben confirmed
by miracles, to this I may answer that in the daye of iudgment
whereas <HI>many shall saie vnto Christ, that they haue prophecyed, cast
out diuells,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 7.</NOTE> <HI>and wrought miracles in his name, our Lord wil answer,
that he knoweth them not.</HI> But God forbidd that I shoulde so
<PB N="106" REF="120"/>
iudge of your fathers. For it is our duty of such as we knowe
not to deme the best. Therefore I deme not but they were
men of God, and acceptable in his sight, as the whiche loued
God though in rude simplicite, yet withe a godly intention.
Neither do I thinke that the maner of their obseruation coulde
be much preiudiciall against them, as longe as they had yet re∣ceiued
no instructions to the contrary. But rather I verely sup∣pose,
seing such cōmaundemēts of God, as they knew, they wil∣lingly
folowed, they would also haue conformed thēselues to
the Catholik iudgemēt, if they had ben so informed. But nowe
Sir you, and your cōpanions, if hearing the decrees of the Apo∣stolike
see, or rather of the vniuersall church and that also con∣firmed
in holy write, you folow not the same, you offend and
sinne herein vndoubtedly. For though your fathers were holy
mē could yet those few of one so smal corner of the vttermost
ilond of the earth, preiudicat the whole church of Christ dis∣persed
through the vniuersall worlde? And if your fa∣ther
<HI>Columba</HI> (yea and our father, if he were the true serua∣unt
of Christe) were holye and mightye in miracles, yet
can he by any meanes be preferred to the moste blessed
prince of the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 16.</NOTE> to whom our Lorde sayed, <HI>Thou
arte Peter, and vppon this rocke I will builde my churche, and
hell gates shall neuer preuaile against her: and to thee I will geue the
kayes off the kingdome of heauen.</HI> Thus when <HI>VVilfrid</HI> conclu∣ded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note the conclusiō of the kin∣ge.</NOTE>
the kinge saied vnto bishop <HI>Colman:</HI> Were these thinges in
dede spoken to Peter of our Lorde? To whom the bishop an∣swered,
yea. Can you then (saieth the kinge) geue euidence
of so speciall authoritie geuen to your father <HI>Columba?</HI> The
bishop answering, No, the kinge spake vnto bothe parties, and
sayed. Agree ye bothe in this without any controuersy, that
these wordes were principally spoken vnto Peter, and that
vnto him the kayes of the kingdome of heauen were geuen?
When bothe had answered, yea: the kinge concluded and sa∣ied.

Then I saye vnto you, that I will not gainsaie such a por∣ter

all pointes to obey his ordinaunces, lest perhaps when
I come to the dores of the kingdome of heauen, I finde none

proued to beare the kayes thereof. Thus when the kinge had

at their departure fewe houses were founde beside the church:
that is to saye, those houses only without the which ciuill
conuersation could no wise be maintained. They had no mo∣ny,
but cattaill. For if they tooke anye mony of riche men,
by and by they gaue it to poore people. Neither was it nede∣full
that either mony should be gathered or houses prouided
for the receiuing and intertainement of the worshipfull and
welthy. Who neuer came then to church, but onely to pra∣ye
and to heare the worde of God. The kinge him selfe,
when occasion serued to resort thither, came accompayned

to serue God. Whereof it came then to passe that euen
the habite of religious men was at that time had in grea∣te

person came, he shoulde be ioyefully receiued of all

as they passed by, euery man gladly and desirously harkened

to the church or to monasteries, not for bely chere, but to hea∣re
the worde of God. And if any priest came by chaunce ab∣rode
into the village, the inhabitaunts thereof would gather

consuming first the south partes of Britanny, taking hol∣de
also in Northumberland with longe and much continuan∣ce,
wasted away an infinit number of men. In the which mor∣talite
the foresaied bishop <HI>Tuda,</HI> was taken out of the worlde,
and honourably buried in a monastery, called <HI>Pegnalech.</HI> This
plague perced also euen to Ireland. There were at that time in
the Iland diuers young gentle men and other of England,
which vnder <HI>Finanus,</HI> and <HI>Colmanus</HI> their bishops, had departed
a side thither, partly to study, partly to liue more straightly.
And some of those forthwith bounde them selues to the reli∣gious
habit, some other wandering rather about the celles and
closets of such as taught, folowed more their study and ler∣ning.
All these the Scottes entertained gladly and cherefully,
geuing them not only their borde and their lerning free, but
bookes also to lerne in. Amōge these, two young gentlemen of
England were of great to wardnesse aboue the rest, <HI>Edelhum</HI>

<P>THe same yeare of the foresaied eclipse and pe∣stilence

bishop Colman ouercommed by the gene∣rall

returned home to his countre, <HI>Deusdedit</HI> the

<HI>Ercombert</HI> also kinke of kent departed this world the very sa∣me
moneth and day, and left to his sonne <HI>Ecgbert</HI> the Crowne
and kingdom, which he receiued and held by the space of ix. ye∣res.
At that time the See of Caunterbury being vacant a great
while, and the diocese desirous of a bishop, <HI>VVighart</HI> a vertu∣ous
priest, a man very well lerned, skilfull of the Canons, rules,
and disciplines of the church, and an english man borne was
sent to Rome bothe by <HI>Ecgbert</HI> and also <HI>Oswin</HI> kinge of Nort∣humberland
(as we haue mencioned before) and with him cer∣tain
presents to the Pope Apostolike, as great store of plate,
bothe siluer and golde. Being arriued to Rome in the time that
<HI>Vitalianus</HI> gouuerned the Apostolike see, and hauing declared
the cause of his coming to the saied Pope, within short space,
he and almost all his company were taken with the pestilence
and died. Whereupon the Pope with aduise and counsell en∣quired
diligently, whom he might direct for Archebishop o∣uer
the churches of England. In the monasterie of <HI>Niridan</HI>
not farre from <HI>Naples in Campania,</HI> there was an Abbat named
<HI>Adrian,</HI> an African borne, a man very well lerned in the scrip∣tures,
<PB REF="127"/>
thouroughly instructed bothe in monasticall discipline,
and in ecclesiasticall gouuernement, very skilfull of the greke
and latin tounges. This man being called to the Pope, was wil∣led
of him to take the bishoprike vpon him, and trauail vnto
England. But he answering that he was no mete man for so
high a degree, promised yet to bringe forth one, which bothe
for his lerning and for his age were more worthy of that vo∣cation.
And offred to the Pope a certain monke liuing in a
Nunnery there by called <HI>Andrew,</HI> who though he were of all
that knewe him, estemed worthy of tke bishoprike, yet for the
impediment of his weake and sickely body, it was not thought
good to sende him. Then Adrian being required againe to take
it vpon him, desired certain daies of respit, if happely in the
meane time, he could finde any other mete to supplie that rou∣me.
At this time there was in Rome a certain monke of Adriās
acquaintaūce, named Theodore, borne at <HI>Tarsus</HI> in <HI>Cilicia</HI> a mā
bothe in prophane and diuine knowleadg, and in the greke and
latin tounge excellently lerned, in maners and conuersation
vertuous, and for age reuerend, being then lxvj. yeres olde.
Him Adrian offered and presented to the pope, and obtained
that he was created bishop. Yet with these conditions that A∣drian
should accompany him in to England, bicause hauing
twise before trauailed in to Fraunce for diuers matters, he had
therefore more experience in that iourney, as also for that he
was sufficiently fournished with men of his owne. But chiefely
that assisting him alwaies in preaching the ghospell, he should
geue diligent eye and waite, that tis Theodore being a greke
borne, enduced not after the maner of the grekes any doctrine
cōtrary to the true faith receaued, in to the english church, now
subiect vnto him. This man therfore being made subdeacon,

to take the ecclesiasticall tonsure rounde, which before he
had taken like vnto the Last church after the maner of S. Pau∣le,

whereof we shall hereafter treate more at large. He was
consecrated bishop of <HI>Vitalianus</HI> then Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 668.</NOTE> in the yeare of our
Lorde 668. the xxvj. daie of Marche vpon a Sonday. After the
xvij. of May in the company of Adrian the Abbat he was di∣rected
to England. Their iourney commenced first by see they
arriued to Marsilia, and so by lande to Arles, where deliuering
to Iohn the Archebishop letters of commendation from <HI>Vita∣lian</HI>
the Pope, they were receaued and enterteyned of him, vn∣till
that <HI>Ebroinus</HI> chief of the kinges Courte gaue them saul∣feconduit
to passe and go whither they entended and woulde.
Which being graunted them, <HI>Theodore</HI> tooke his iourney to
<HI>Agilbert</HI> bishop of Paris, of whome we haue spoken before, and
was very frindly receaued of him and kept there a longe tyme.
But Adrian went first to <HI>Emmeson</HI> and after to <HI>Faron</HI> bishop of
<HI>Meldes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The coū∣tre abowt Lyons.</NOTE> and there continewed and rested withe them a good

was browght to king Ecgbert, that the bishop, whom they had
desired of the Pope of Rome was come, and rested in Fraunce,
he sent thither straight waye <HI>Redfride</HI> his lieutenant to bringe

with the license of <HI>Ebroinus,</HI> and browght him to the porte

<P>AT that time was <HI>VVulpher</HI> king of the Marshes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lincolne diocese, and Lich∣field, and VVorce∣ter.</NOTE> who
after the death of <HI>Iaruman,</HI> desired of <HI>Theodore</HI> to ha∣ue

<HI>Theodore</HI> would not consecrate them a newe bishop, but desy∣red
king Oswin, that Chadde might be their bishop, who at
that time liued quietly in his monasterie at <HI>Lesting,</HI> and <HI>VVil∣frid</HI>
ruled the diocese of yorke, and also of all Northumberlan∣de,
and of the Pictes to, as far as king Oswines dominion dyd
reache. And bicause the said most reuerend bishop Chadde was

more walking a fote wher he went, than on horsebacke, <HI>Theo∣dore</HI>
willed him to ryde, when so euer he had any iourney to

himselfe did lifte him on horsebacke with his owne han∣des,
knowing him in dede to be a very holy man, and so cōpel∣led
him to ride whether nede required. Chadd heing thus made
bishop of the Marshes, the middle english men and of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lincolne shere.</NOTE> Lindis∣se,
he diligently gouerned the same after the examples of the
auncient fathers in great perfection of life. Vnto whom al∣so
king <HI>VVulpher</HI> gaue the land of L. tenements to build a mo∣nasterie
with all in the place which is called <HI>Etbeare,</HI> which is
by a wood in the prouince of Lindisse, where vntill this daye
the steppes of monasticall lyfe which he began and placed the∣re,
<PB N="115" REF="130"/>
do yet remaine. The seate and chiefe mansion of the diocese
he held at <HI>Lichfield,</HI> where he dyed also and was buried, and
where vntill this day cotineweth the see of the bishops that suc¦cede
in the same prouince. This man had made himselfe not
far from the churche a certaine closet and priuate mansion, in
which as often as he was at leysure from the busynesse and mi∣nisterie
of the ghospell, he was wont to pray and reade secretly
with a fewe, that is to saye, vij. or viij. bretherne with him. And
when he had gouerned the church most worthely in that pro∣uince
two yeres and an halfe, by the dispensation and appoin∣tement
of God aboue, that time came, which the Ecclefiastes
speaketh of:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 3.</NOTE> <HI>There is a time to lay abrode stones, and a time to gather
them together againe.</HI> For there came a plage sent from God,
which by the death of the body remoued the liue stones of the
churche from the earthly places to the celestiall building in he∣auen.
For very many of the churche of this most reuerend bis∣shop
were taken out of this life. And when his howre was co∣me
to, that he should passe out of this worlde to our Lorde, it
happened on a certaine day, that he abode in the foresayd clo∣set,
and had no mo but one brother with him, whose name was
<HI>Owen,</HI> all the reast of his felowes being retourned to churche,
as the cause and houre required. This same <HI>Owen</HI> was a monke
of great perfection, and one that had forsaken the world with
pure intent and hope of the rewarde of heauen, a man for all
pointes worthy to whome God in speciall wise might reuele
and shewe his secrettes, and well worthy to whose wordes the
hearers may giue credit. For coming with Quene <HI>Edildride</HI>
from the prouince of the East English, and being the chief off
her seruauntes, and gouernour of her house, for the great zeale
of faith that encreased in him determining with himselfe to
renounce the world, did in dede accomplysh the same not slac∣kely
and negligently, but in such sort vncladd himself of worl∣dly
matters, that forsaking all that euer he had, being clothed
<PB REF="131"/>
but with plaine and poore apparayl and bearing an hatchet or
axe in his hand, came to the monasterie of the same most reue∣rend
father, called Lestinghe. For he signified that he would
entre into the monasterie not for ease and idlenesse, as some do,
but to trauaile and labour: which thing he well shewed and pro¦ued
in his doinges: for the leasse able and apte that he was for
the studie and meditatiō of the scriptures, the more diligēt and
painfull he was to worke with his handes. Finally his reueren∣ce
and deuotion was such that the bishop accepted him for one
of his brethern to accompany him with the other fewe in the
foresaid closet. Where while they with in were occupied in rea∣ding
and prayer, he without dyd those thinges abrode that we∣re
necessarie to be done. And on a certaine day as he was doo∣ing
some such thing abrode, the reast being gone to churche,
as I began to say, and the bishop being alone in the oratorie of
the house, occupied in reading or prayer, this <HI>Owen</HI> heard so∣dainly
(as he after told) a most swete noyse of voyces singing
and reioysinge comming downe from heauen to the earth: the
which voice, he sayd, he first heard begynning from the south
east, that is, from whence the depth of winter comes, and then
by litle and litle drawinge nere him, vntill it came to the
roofe of the oratorie where the bishop was, where it entred, fil∣led
it within, and compassed it all rownd about. Whereat ge∣uing
earnestly mind to marke the thinge that he heard, he did
againe as it were about an houre after heare the same ioyfull
song go vp and ascend from the roofe of the said oratorie, and
retourne vp to the heauens the very same way that it came,
with vnspeakeable swetenes. Whereat as he mused a space and
was as it were astouned, imagining and deuising depely in his
minde what this might be, the bishop opened the oratorie
windowe, and as he vsed to doo, made a noyse and signe with
his hand, and bad some man come into him, if there were any
body without. Then came he straight way, to whome the bis∣shop
<PB N="116" REF="131"/>
said: Go to the churche quickely, and cause those vij.
bretherne to come hither, and come you with them to.
And when they were come, first he admonished them to kepe a∣mong
them selues, and toward all faithfull folke the vertue of
charitie and peace, and also with vnweary continuance to fo∣lowe
the rules and orders of monastical discipline, which they
had either learned of him, and sene in him, or founde in the
doings or sayings of the former fathers. And then did he tell
them moreouer, that the day of his departing was very nigh at
hand. For that most louely geast, quod he, who was wonte to
visit our bretherne, hath voutsafed this day to come to me al∣so,
and to call me out of this world. Wherefore go your waies
to churche againe, and speake vnto the bretherne that with
their prayers they both commend vnto our Lorde my depar∣ting,
and remember also with fasting, watching, prayers, and
good workes to preuent their own departing the houre wher∣of
is vncertaine. And when he had spoken these and mo like
wordes, and that the brethern had taken his blessing, and
wer gone forth very heauy and sad, he that only heard the hea∣uenly
song, came in againe, and casting himselfe flat on the
ground, sayed: I beseke you good father, may I be so bold as to
aske you a question? Aske what you will, quod he. Then, quod
the other, I pray you tell me, what was that song which I heard
of that ioyfull company descending from heauen vpon this
oratorie, and after a time retourninge to heauen againe. He
aunswered and saied to him: If you haue hearde the voice of
the song, and vnderstoode the comming of the heauenly com∣paines,
I commaund you in the name of our Lorde to tell no
man herof before my death. They were in dede the spirites of
angelles, which came to call me to the heauenly rewardes,
which I haue alway loued and longed for, and after vij. daies
they haue promised to come againe and take me with them.
The which was in dede fullfilled euen as it was foretolde
<PB REF="132"/>
him. For straight way was he taken with a feyntnes of bodye,
which daily grewe more greuouse vpon him and the vij. daye
(as it had bene promised him) after he had first forewarded his
departing with the receiuing of the bodie and bloud of our
Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How se∣ling be∣fore de∣ath.</NOTE> his holy soule loosed from the prison of the bodie was
caried and lead (as we may well beleue) of the company of An∣gelles
to the ioyes euerlastinge. And it is no meruaile, if he
gladly behelde the day of death, or rather the day of our Lorde,
which daye he did alwaies carefully looke for till it came. For
among his manifold merites of chastitie and abstinence, of
preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gre∣at feare of God in B. Chadd.</NOTE> of praier, of wilfull pouertie, and other vertues, he
was so far humbled to the feare of our Lorde, so much mind∣ful
of his later end in all his workes, that (as a certaine brother
named <HI>Trumbert</HI> was wont to tell me, one of them that read
the scriptures to me, and was brought vp in his monasterie
and gouernement) if perhaps while he were reading, or doing
some other thing, there rose any sodaine great blast of wind, by
and by wold he cal on the mercy of our Lord, and beseke him
to haue pitie on mākinde. But and if there came a blast yet mo∣re
vehement, then wold he shut vp his booke and fall downe
on his face, and set him selfe more feruently to prayer. And if
any stronger storme or blustreing showre continewed long, or
that lightning and thunders did make both the earth and ayre
to shake for feare, then would he go to churche, and earnestly
set his mind to praier and saying of psalmes, vntill the ayre
waxed clere againe. And when some of his companie asked
him, why he did so: Haue ye not read, quod he: <HI>That our Lord
hath thundred from heauen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 17.</NOTE> <HI>and the most high hath giuen his voice?
He hath sent out his arrowes, and scattered them abrode, he hath
multiplied lighteninge and troubled them?</HI> For our Lorde moueth
the ayre, reyseth vp windes, shooteth out lighteninges, thun∣dreth
from heauen, to styrre vp the creatures of the earth to
feare him, to cal againe their hartes to the remembraunce of the

iudgement to come, to plucke downe their pride, and abate
their boldenes, and thus to bringe to their mindes that terri∣ble
time, when both heauens and earth shall burne, and him∣selfe
come vpon the clowdes with great power and maiestie
to iudge both the quicke and the dead.
And therfore, quod he,
it behoueth vs with dewe feare and loue to yelde and giue pla∣ce
to his warning from heauen that as ofte as he trowbleth the
ayre, and lyfteth vpp his hande as it were threatning to strike,
and doth not yet strike, we strayght way call vpon his mercie,
and boulting owt the very botome of our hartes, and casting
owt the dregges and relikes of synne, do carefully prouide that
we neuer deserue to be striken at all. With the reuelation and
relation of the foresayd brother concerning the death of this
bysshopp, the wordes also of <HI>Ecgbert</HI> the most reuerend father
do well agree, of whome we spake before. Whiche <HI>Ecgbert</HI> at
the tyme whē the sayd <HI>Chadda</HI> was a youngman, and himself of
lyke age to, dyd in Ireland strayghtly lead a monasticall lyfe
both together in prayers, continence, and meditation of the
holy scriptures. But Chadda being afterward retourned to
his countree, <HI>Ecgbert</HI> abode there styll as a pilgrime for our
Lordes sake vnto the end of his lyfe. Nowe a long tyme af∣ter
there came to visite him from England a certaine most ho∣ly
and vertuous man named <HI>Higbalde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lincolne shere.</NOTE> who was an <HI>Abbot</HI> in
the prouince of <HI>Lindisse.</HI> And as they talked together of the
lyfe of the former fathers, as is the maner of such holy men to
doo, and gladly wold wysh to followe the same, they fell vpon
mention of the most reuerend byshop <HI>Chadda.</HI> And than sayd
Ecgbert: I knowe a man yet remayning aliue in this Ilande,
which whē brother Chadda passed owt of the world, dyd see
a companye of Angelles descend from heauen, and take vp his
sowle withe them and retourned againe to the celestiall king∣domes.
Which vision whether <HI>Ecgbert</HI> meaned to be sene of
himselfe, or of some other, it is to vs vncertaine: yet while so
<PB REF="133"/>
worthy a man, as he, sayed that it was true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charite beleueth all things 1. Cor. 13.</NOTE> the thing it self can
not be vncertaine vnto vs. Thus dyed Chadda the vj. daye
of Marche, and was buryed first by S. Maries Churche, but af∣terward
his bones were remoued into the church of the most
blessed Saint Peter chiefe of thapostles, the same churche be∣ing
finished. In both which places in token of his vertu often
miracles of healing sicke folke are wonte to be wrought.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miracles at the tom¦be of S. Chead.</NOTE> And
of late a certaine man that had a phrenesie, and ranne vpp and
downe wandring euery where, came thither at an euening, and
by the ignorance or negligence of them that kept the place, lay
there all the night, and the next morning came owt well in
his wyt, and declared, to the great wonder and ioye of all men,
that there he had by the gyfte and goodnes of our Lorde got∣ten
his health. The place of the sepulchre is couered with a
wodden tombe made like a litle howse, hauing an hole in the

wont to put in their hand and take owt some of the dowste.

all in common treate and debate such thinges as appertaine to
the right faith, keging vprightly and straighly the decrees and
determinations of our lerned auncetours and holy fathers.
These and such like thinges for the preseruation of charite and
vnite amonge vs, and in the church when I had saied, and ma∣de
an end of that exhortation and preface.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deter¦minations of the ho∣ly fathers to be folo¦wed.</NOTE> I demaunded of e∣che
of them in order, whether they agreed to kepe those thin∣ges,
which are canonically decreed of the auncient fathers of

It pleaseth vs all very well, that those things which the canons
of the holy fathers haue defined and appointed, we all do kepe
and obserue the same. And then straight way did I bringe furth
vnto them the booke of canons, and out of the same booke I
shewed, before them ten articles, which I had noted out of di∣uerse
places, bycause I knew them to be most necessarie for vs,
and I besought them, that the same mougthe be receaued
and kepte diligently of all men.</P>
<P>The first article was, that we al in common do kepe the holy
feast of Ester on the sonday after the xiiij. day of the moone in
the moneth of Marche. The second that no bishop should haue
ought to do in an others diocese, but be contented with the
chardge of the people committed vnto him. The third, that no
bishop should moleste or anye wise troble such monasteries as
were consecrated and giuen to God, nor violently take from
thē ought that was theirs. The fourth, that monks shuld not go
<PB REF="135"/>
from place to place, that is to say, from one monasterie to an o∣ther,
onlesse by the leaue of their own abbot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vowe of obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> religiō.</NOTE> but should conti∣new
in the obedience which they promised at the time of their
cōuersiō and entring into religiō. The fift, that none of the cler∣gy
forsaking his own bishop shuld runne vp and down wher he
list, nor whē he came any whither, should be receaued without
letters of commendation from his diocesan. And if that he be
ones receaued, and will not retourne being warned and called
both the receauer and he that is receaued shall incurre the sen∣tence
of excommunication. The sixte, that such bishops and
clerkes as are strangers, be content with such hospitalitie as is
giuen them, and that it be laufull for none of them to execute
any office of a priest, without the permission of the bishop in
whose diocese they are knowen to be. The seuenth, that whe∣reas
by the auncient decrees a synode and conuocation ought
to be assembled twise a yere, yet bicause diuerse inconuenien∣ces
doo happen amonge vs, it hath semed good to vs all, that it
should be assembled onse a yere the first day of August at the
place called Clofeshooh. The eight, that no bishop should am∣bitiously
preferre him selfe before an other, but should all ac∣knowledge
the time and order of their consecration. In the ix.
article it was generally entreated, that the nomber of bishops
should be encreased, the nomber of Christian folke waxing
daily greater, but hereof at this time we sayed no farther. The
x. for mariages, that noman cōmit aduoutrie, nor formication,
that noman forsake his owne wife, but for only fornicati∣on,
as the holy ghospell teacheth. And if any man put away his
wif being laufully maried vnto him, if he wil be a right Christi¦an
man, let him be ioyned to none other: but let him so conti∣newe
still sole, or els be reconciled againe to his owne wife.
And thus these articles being in common treated of, and agreed

<P>FOr in this monasterie many wonderfull signes of vertues

written of them that knewe the same. Some of the which we
will also put in our ecclesiasticall historie. When the tem∣pest
of the same plage so often mentioned, storming ouer all
the Ilond, came to this monasterye and had entred vpon that
part thereof where the men dyd lyue, and dayly one or other
was taken owt of the worlde to our Lorde, this good mother
being carefull of her companie, at such tyme as also the same
visitation of God towched that part of the monasterie, in whi∣che
the flocke of Goddes hand maydes dwelled by them selues,
from the mens companye, began ofte tymes in the couent to
aske the sisters in what place abowt the monasterie they wold
haue their bodies to be layed against suche tyme as it showlde
happen them to be taken out of this world with the same hand
of Gods visitation as other were. And when she could get no

made perfect in infirmitie,</HI> she was sodainly taken with a very gre∣uouse
sickenesse of body, and was therewith very sore tormē∣ted
by the space of ix. yeares, through the mercyfull prouision
<PB REF="138"/>
of our redemer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinne pur¦ged by pai¦ne in this lyfe.</NOTE> to this end, that what so euer spot of defilinge
sinne had through ignorance or negligence any thing long re∣mained
in her among her vertues, it might al be perboyled out
by the fire of long tribulation. This same woman on a certaine
night, when the day light began a litle to appere, as she went
out of her chamber that she abode in, sawe plainly as it were a
corse, brighter than the sonne, wound vp in a shete and caried
vpward from the dortery where the sisters were wont to rea∣ste.
And as she diligently marked what it shoulde be that drewe
vp this vision of the gloriouse body which she behelde, she sa∣we
as it were certaine cordes brighter than gold, which drewe
it vp so hye, till it was taken into the open heauens, and than
she could see it no longer. Which vision when she thought v∣pon
with her selfe, she douted no whit, but some person of that
company should dye shortly, whose soule should be lifted vp
to heauen by the good workes it had done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good workes.</NOTE> euen as by golden
cordes. Which thing happened so in dede. For not many dayes
after, the mother of that couent, for the loue that God bare her
was deliuered out of the prison of this flesh. Whose life was
certainly such, that no man which knewe it, can dout, but that
the entring in to the heauenly mansion was open vnto her go∣ing
out of this life. There was also in the same monasterie a cer¦taine
holy Nonne, both noble for the dignitie of this world,
and more noble for the loue that she had of the world to co∣me.
The which many yeres was so bereafte of al vse of her lim∣mes,
that she was not able so much as to moue one parte of her
bodye. This Nonne when she knewe that the body of the reue∣rend
Abbesse was brought and layed in the churche vntill it
should be buryed, desired that she might be caried thither, and
be layd by the same, bowing downe as folke doo at their pra∣yers.
Which thing being done,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The like maner of deuotion vsed Con¦stantia a holy wo∣man at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mbe of Hilarion the monk, as S.

and so longe tormentes. And not long after her petition was
heard and graunted: for xij. dayes after she was taken out of
this life also, and receaued euerlasting rewarde in chaunge of
those temporall afflictions. Nowe when <HI>Torithgid</HI> the fore∣said
handmayd of Christe had lyued three yeare more after the
death of the Abbesse, she was so far pyned away with the sic∣kenesse
that we spake of before, that the skyn and bones did
scant cleaue together. And at last the time of her departing be∣ing
nowe at hand, she could not only styr none of all her lim∣mes,
but was speachelesse and could not moue her tongue. In
which case as she lay three daies and as many nightes, sodainly
being relieued with a ghostly vision, she opened her mouthe
and eyes, and looking vp to heauen begā thus to speake to the
vision which she sawe. Thy comminge is to me mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ioyfull,
and thou arte hartely wellcome. And when she had so sayd,
she held her peace a litle, as it were abyding for an aunswere of
him whome she sawe and spake to. And then as it were a litle
angerly she sayed againe: I can not gladly suffer this. And
straightway holding her peace a litle, she spake the third tyme
and sayd: If it may not by any meanes be to day, I beseche the
that the meane time be not longe delayed: wherewith holding
her peace a litle as she had done before, she ended and conclu∣ded
her talke thus. And if it be fully so appointed, and that
this sentence and order can not be changed, I beseke thee that

word that the time of her passing hence was nye. For euen as

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sebbi king of the same prouince ended his lyfe in monasti∣call conuersation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The. 11. Chapter.</HEAD>
<P>AT that time, as also the foresayd booke sheweth, there
raigned ouer the East Saxons a man very deuout and
godly named <HI>Sebbi,</HI> of whome we made mention ab∣oue.
For he was very much geuen to exercises of religion, and
vertu, to much and often praier, and to charitable al¦mesdedes,
esteming the solitarie and monastical life before all the ryches∣se
and honours of a kingdome. Which kinde of lyfe he had ta∣ken
long time before, and giuen vp his kingdome had not the
selfewilled mind of his wife refused to separate from him. And
therfore some men thought (as it had bene often sayed) that a
man of such a nature and well disposed mind, was more mete
to be made a bishop then a king. Nowe when this souldiour of
the ecclesiasticall kingdome had passed ouer xxx. yeres in his
temporall reigne, at lenght he died. But first he admonished
his wife, that then at least they should wholly geue themselues
both together to serue God, whereas they could no lenger now
enioye or rather serue the world together. Which thing when
he had with much a doo obtained of her, he came to the bis∣shop
of London named Waldher who had succeded <HI>Ercon∣wald,</HI>
and at his hand and blessing receaued the habit of religi∣on,
which he had long desyred. To which bishop he brought a
great somme of mony to be bestowed and giuē to the poore, re¦seruing
<PB REF="140"/>
nothing at all for him selfe, but rather desyring to re∣maine
poore in spirite for the kingdome of heauen. And when
he perceaued the day of his death to be at hand, bicause the fo∣resayd
sicknesse grewe on still vpon him, for the princely
haught courage that he had, he began to feare least at his death
throughe the bitter pange of the same, he might hap either to
vtter with his mouth, or with some other part of his body
doo any thing, that were not mete and comly for his person.
And therefore he sent for the bishop of London, where he al∣so
then continewed, and desyred him that at his departing and
passing out of this world, there should be no mo present but
the bishop himselfe, and two of his chapplens. Which thing
when the bishop had promised moste gladly to doo, not long
after, the said man of God setting him selfe to slepe, sawe a
comfortable vision, which toke from him all care of the fore∣sayd
feare and shewed him moreouer on what day he shoulde
ende this lyfe. For he sawe (as he after reported him selfe) three
men come to him araied in bright shining clothing, and one
of them, while his felowes, that came with him, stode by and
asked how the sicke man did whom they came to visite, sate
before his bed and sayed, that his soule should departe from the
bodie both without pain, and also with great light and bright∣nesse.
And he farther also declared vnto him that he should
die the third day after. Both which things (as he learned by the
vision) were so fulfilled in dede. For the third day ensuyng
when the ix. houre was come, sodainly as if he had fallen
in to a softe slepe he gaue vp the ghoste without feeling any
grief at all. And whereas for the buriall of his body, they had
prepared a tombe of stone when they began to lay his bodie
in it they found it to be longer then the tombe by the quanti∣tie
of an handbreadth. They hewed therefore the stone as
much as they might, and made it longer than it was about two
fingers breadth, but yet it could not receaue the bodie not so
<PB N="125" REF="140"/>
neyther. Whereupon bicause of this distresse of burying him
they were minded, eyther to seke an other tombe, or els, if they
might, to gather in the body by bowing of the knees, that so it
might be holden and receaued of the same tombe. But a won∣derfull
case happened, and not withowt the working of God
from heauen, the whiche kept them from doing any of those
thinges. For sodainly, the byshopp standing by and the sayd
kinges sonne a monke also <HI>Sighard</HI> by name, which after him
raigned with his brother <HI>Frede,</HI> and also a great company of o∣ther
men, the very same tombestone was found to be of a fyt
length for the quantitie of the bodie. Yea and so much that
at the head there might also a pillowe be layde betwene: and
at the feete there remained in the tombe bysyde the body about
the quantitie of fowre fingers. And thus was he buried and La∣yed
in the Churche of the blessed doctour teacher of the gen∣tiles

he went and wandred in many places a longe

could not gett into his owne diocese againe,

as far as the West Saxons, contayning vij. M. tenementes,
and was yet at that time lyuing in the paynimes lawe. Vnto
them did he minister the worde of faith and baptisme of salua∣tion.
The king of the same countree, whose name was <HI>Edil∣wach</HI>
was christened not long before in the prouince of the

Who also at the fonte was his godfather, and in signe of that
adoption gaue him two prouinces, that is to say, the Ile of
wight, and the prouince of <HI>Manures,</HI> in the West parte of En∣gland.
By the permission therefore and great reioysing of the
king, this bishopp christened the chiefe Lordes and knightes of
the countree. And the reast of the people at thesame time or
sone after were christened by the priestes <HI>Eappa, Padda, Bru∣chelin,</HI>
and <HI>Oidda.</HI> The Quene also named <HI>Ebba</HI> was christened
in her Ile, which was in the prouince of the Viccians: for she
was the doughter of Eanfride who was <HI>Eanberes</HI> brother, whi∣che
were both christen men, and all their people. But all the
prouince of the South Saxons had neuer before that time he∣ard

a certaine monke, a Scot borne named <HI>Dicul,</HI> which had

or heare their preaching. But when bishop Wilfride came and
preached the gospel vnto them, he not only deliuered thē from
the miserie and perill of eternall damnation, but also from an
horrible morraine of this temporall death. For in three yeares
before his comming to that prouince, it had not rayned one

bodies of them all did reioyse in the liuing God: knowing that
he which is the true God, had by his heauenly grace enryched
them both with inwarde and outward giftes and goodes. For
this bishop also when he came into the countree, and sawe so
great a plage of famine there, taught them to get their suste∣naunce

had great abundance of fysh. But the people had no skill at all
to fish for any thing els but eeles. And therefore they of the

raigned in many prouinces of England, which plage by the
pleasure of Gods dispensation and ordinaunce when it tou∣ched
also the foresayed monasterie, which at that time the most

Reuerend and vertuouse priest of Christ Eappa did rule
and gouerne, and that many bothe of them that came thither
with the bishop, and also of such as had bene lately called to
the faith in the same prouince of the South Saxons were taken
daily out of this life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fasting against the plage.</NOTE> it semed good to the bretherne to appoint
themselues to faste three daies and humbly to beseke the mer∣cy
of God, that he wold voutsafe to shew grace and mercy to∣warde
them, and deliuer them from this perilouse plage and
present deathe, or at least when they were taken out of
this world, to saue their soules from eternall damnation. The∣re
was at that time in the same monasterie a certaine litle bo∣ye,
that was lately come to the faith, a Saxon borne, which was
taken with the same sickenesse, and had kept his bed no small
time. And when the second day of the said fasting and pray∣ing
was nowe come, it happened that about vij. a clocke in the
morning, as the boy was leafte al alone in the place where he
lay sicke, sodainly by the appointement of God there vowtsa∣fed
to appere vnto him the most blessed two chiefe Apostles
S. Peter, and S. Paul. For the boy was of a very innocent and
meke mind and nature, and with sincere deuocion kepte the
sacramente of faith which he had receaued. In this vision the
Apostles first saluted him with most gentle wordes, saying:
Feare not, Sonne, the death, for which thou art so pensife: for
we wil this day bring thee to the kingdom of heauen. But first
thou must tary til the Masses be said, and after thou hast recea∣ued
thy viage prouisiō, the body and bloud of our Lord, being
so released both of sickenes and death thou shalt be lifted vp to
the euerlasting ioyes in heauen. Therefore doo thou call for
priest <HI>Eappa</HI> vnto thee, and tell him, that our Lorde hath heard
your prayers and deuocion, and hath mercifully looked vpon
your fastinge, neither shall there any one more dye of this pla∣ge,
either in this monasterie, or in any of the possessions that
adioyne to the same. But as many as belonge to you any where
<PB REF="144"/>
and lye sicke, shall rise againe from their sickenes and be resto∣red
to their former health, saue only thow, which this daye
shalt be deliuered from death, and be brought to heauen to the
vision of our Lord Christ, whome thow haste faithfully ser∣ued.
Which thing it hath pleased the mercy of God to doo for
you, through the intercession of the godly and dere seruant
of God king Oswald,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interces∣sion of Saintes.</NOTE> which sometime gouerned the countre
of Northumberland most nobly both with the authoritie of
this temporall kingdome, and also in holynesse and deuotion
of Christen pietie which leadeth to the euerlasting kingdom.
For on this very day the same king being bodely slaine in bat∣taile
of the infidels and miscreants was straight takē vp to hea∣uē
to the eternal ioyes of the soule, and felowship of the chosen
and electe companies. Let them seke in their booke that haue
the notes of the departing of the dead, and they shall fynd that
he was takē out of the world on this selfe day, as we haue sayd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Masse in the me∣mory of Saints.</NOTE>
And therfor let thē say Masses and geue thankes that their pra∣yer
is heard, and also for the memory of the sayd king. Oswald,
which sometime gouerned their nation. For therefore did he
humbly pray our Lord for them, as being straūgers and exiles
of his people. And when all the bretherne are come together
to the churche, let them all be houselled and so fynish their fa∣ste,
and refresh their bodies with sustenaunce. All the which
wordes when the boy had declared to the priest being cal∣led
vnto him, the priest enquired of him, what maner of aray
and lykenes the men had, which appeared vnto him. He aun¦sweared,
they were very notable and goodly in their aray and
countenaunces, and exceding ioyfull and beautifull, such as he
neuer had sene before nor beleued that any men could be of
so great comlynesse and beautie. The one was shauen like a
priest, the other had a long beard. And they sayd, that the one
of them was called Peter and thother Paul, and that they were
the ministers and seruantes of our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus
<PB N="129" REF="144"/>
Christ of whome they were sent from heauen for the sauing
and defense of our monasterie. Wherefore the priest belieued
the wordes of the boye, and went out by aud by and sought in
his booke of Cronicles, and found that king Oswald was
slaine on that very day. Then called he the bretherne together
and commaunded dyner to be prouided, and masses to be sayd,
and that they should all communicat after the accustomed ma∣ner.
And also willed a parte of the same sacrifice of our Lordes
oblation to be brought to the sicke boye: which thinge so do∣ne,
not lōg after the boy died the very same day, and proued by
his death, that the wordes were true which he had heard of
Christes Apostles. And this morouer gaue witnesse to his wor¦des,
that at that time no creature of the same monasterie was
taken out of the world, except him only. By which vision ma∣ny
that might heare of the same, were meruaylowsly styrred
and enflamed, both to praye and call for Gods mercy in aduer∣sitie,
and also to vse the holesome helpes and medicines of fa∣stinge.
And from that time not in that monasterie only, but in
very many other places to, the birthe day of the sayd kinge and
champion of Christ began yearely to be kept holy with mas∣ses
and deuout seruice most reuerently.</P>

honour of the most bessed chief of thapostles S. Peter by the
mouth of the riuer Were, he came to Rome as he had ofte bene
wont to do before with his felowe and helper in the same
worke <HI>Ceolfride,</HI> (who after him was abbot of the same mona∣sterie)
and was receaued most honourably of Pope <HI>Agatho</HI> of
worthy memorie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priuilege from Ro∣me for the liber∣tie of mo∣nasteries.</NOTE> of whome he desyred and obtained for the
warrant and assurance of the libertie of the monasterie that he
had erected, a letter of priuilege confirmed by the authoritie
Apostolique in such forme as he knewe the will and graunt of
king Ecgfride to be, by whose leaue, and liberall gyfte of pos∣session
and land he had made the sayd monasterie. He obtai∣ned
also to haue with him, the foresayd Abbot Ihon into En∣gland,
to the entente he might teache in his monasterie the
yearly course and order of singing, as it was in <HI>S.</HI> Peters at Ro∣me.
<PB N="132" REF="147"/>
And so the sayd Abbot Ihon did, as sone as he had comma∣undemente
by the Pope, both with his owne voyce and pre∣sence
teaching the chantours and singing men of the saied
monastery the order and forme of singing and reading:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of singing and chur∣che serui∣ce from Rome.</NOTE> and al∣so
putting in writing those thinges that appertained to the ce∣lebration
of highe feastes and holy dayes for the whole cōpas∣se
of the yere. Which things of his writing haue bene hither∣to
kept in the same monastery, and are now euery wher copied
out by diuerse. And the same Ihon did not only teache the
brethren of that monasterie, but such as were skilled in songe
came together to here him almost from all the monasteries of
the same prouince. And many to did earnestly desyre and en∣treat
him in such places where he taught to come to them him
selfe. Beside this office and skill to teache synging and reading
he had also an other charge in commaundement from the Po∣pe
Apostolike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The he∣resy of the Mo∣notholi∣te.</NOTE> which was that he should diligently learne of
what faith the churche of England was, and bring worde the∣reof
at his retourne to Rome. For not longe before there
had ben kepte at Rome a Synod by the holy Pope <HI>Mar∣tin,</HI>
of the consent of. Cv. bishops against them principally, that
preached one only working and will in Christe. Which Syno∣de
he brought with him, and gaue it to be writen and copyed
out in the foresayd monasterie of the moste vertuouse Abbot
<HI>Benedict.</HI> For such men had at that time very sore troubled the
faith of the churche of <HI>Constantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Po∣pe is in∣formed of the sta¦te of the church. <HI>Lege Cipr. lib. 1. epist, 3. et Aug. ep. 92. &amp; 93.</HI></NOTE> but by the goodnes and
gyfte of our Lorde they were anon espied out and conuicted
at the same time. Wherefore <HI>Agatho</HI> the Pope minding as in
other prouinces, so also in England to be enformed what the
Churche was, and howe clere it was from the pestilent conta∣gions
of heretikes, committed this charge and busynes to the
most Reuerend Abbot Ihon being nowe appointed to go to
England. And therefore when the synode, which we spake of
before, was called together in England for this purpose, the
<PB REF="148"/>
catholike faith was in them all found clere, sownd, and vncor¦rupted.
And a copie of the same was geuen him to carie to
Rome. But in his retourning homewarde, not long after he
passed the sea, he fell sicke by the way and died. His body for
the loue of S. Martin, whose monasterie he gouerned, was by
his frendes brought vnto Tours, and there buried honorably.
For as he went toward England he was gentelly receaued and
lodged in that churche, and desired earnestly of the bretherne
ther that whē he retourned to Rome, he wold come that way,
and lodge with them. Finally he toke with him from thence
certaine to helpe and succour him both in his iourney, and also
in his busynes that he was charged withall: who althoughe he
thus died by the way, yet neuerthelesse the copie of the Ca∣tholique
faith of England was brought to Rome, and receaued
most gladly and ioyfully of the Pope apostolike, and of al that
heard or read the same.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The. 19. Chapter.</HEAD>
<P>KIng <HI>Egfride</HI> tooke to wife a woman named <HI>Edildride</HI>
the doughter of <HI>Anna</HI> king of the East english, of whom
we haue ofte made mention, a man meruailouse godly
and in al pointes notable for vertu both of thought and dede.
This sayd woman had bene wedded to an other man before
him, that is to saye, to the prince of the South Giruians named
<HI>Tonbert.</HI> But he died a litle after he had maried her, and then she
was geuen to wife to the foresayd kinge. With whome she li∣ued
xij. yeres, and yet remained continually a pure and glori∣ous
virgin, euen as bishop Wilfrid a man of blessed memorie
did shewe me enquiring of purpose of the matter, bicause ma∣ny
did doubte thereof, and saied vnto me that he coulde
of all men be a very sure witnesse of her virginitie, for so much
as kinge <HI>Ecgfrid</HI> promised to geue him landes and much mo∣ney,
if he coulde persuade the quene to vse his companie,
<PB N="133" REF="148"/>
though yet he knewe well that she loued no man in the world
more then him. And it is not to be mystrusted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhy the miracles here repor¦ted ought not to be mistrusted <HI>Luc.</HI> 22.</NOTE> but that the

which promiseth to abyde with vs vnto the end of the world.
For besyde this, the signe and token of the diuine miracle, in
that the flesh of the same virgin buryed could not be corrupted
and putrefied, doth well shewe, that she lyued alway vncorrup∣ted
and vntouched of any man. Againe it is well knowen, she
besowght the king very much and a long time, that she mighte
forsake the cares of the world, and haue leaue to go into a mo∣nasterie,
and ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only to serue Christ the true king. Which
when she had at last obtayned, she entred into the monasterie
of Abbesse <HI>Ebbe,</HI> who bare a good affection to kinge <HI>Ecgfride.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nonnes cōsecrated of bishops</NOTE>
The monasterie standeth in a towne called <HI>Coludi,</HI> and the a∣foresayd

nonne. Within a yere after whiche, she was herselfe made an
Abbesse in the ile of Ely in which place there was built a mo∣nastery
of virgins dedicated to God, amonge whom she began
to be a very good mother and virgin bothe in examples and al∣so
good lessons of heauenly lyfe. Of her it is sayd, that after
the time that she went to the monasterie, she wold neuer weare
any lynnen but only wollen clothes, and seldome wash her∣selfe
in warme bathes, saue against solemne highe feastes, as
Easter, whitsontyde, or twelfetyde, and than would she be the
last of all, and with her owne handes and helpe of her hande∣maydes
wold first wash the reast of Christes virgins that were
there. Very seldom also excepte on high feastes or for great ne∣cessitie
dyd she eate more than onse a day, and that continual∣ly,
on lesse a greater feblenesse dyd let her. From the time
of the first comming to prayer together vntill the rysing of
the day she abode in the Churche still continewing at her

prayers. And there are that say, that by the spirite of prophecie
she dyd foretell both the pestilence wherof she should dye her∣selfe,
and also did openly in all their presence declare the nom∣ber
of them that showld be taken from this world owt of her
monasterie. She was takē away to our Lord in the mids of her
company seuen yeres after she was made Abbesse. And as she
her self had willed, she was buryed in a tombe of wood in none
other place than in the myds of them in such order and sort as
she departed. After whome succeded her sister <HI>Sexburg</HI> in the
office of Abbesse, which woman <HI>Earcombert</HI> king of Kent had
had to wyfe. And when <HI>Edildride</HI> had lyen buried xvj. ye∣res,
it semed good to her sayd syster nowe Abbesse, to haue
her bones taken vpp, and put in a newe tombe, and remoued
into the churche. Whereupon she wylled certaine of the bre∣therne
to seke a stone, whereof they mighte make a tombe for
this purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ile of Eelye.</NOTE> And they taking ship (for the countree of <HI>Eelye</HI>
is round abowt compassed with waters and fennes, nor hathe
any great stones for such purposes) came to a certaine litle ci∣tie
leafte desolate and vnhabited, the which was not far from
thence, and in the englysh tonge is called <HI>Grandchester,</HI> and
straight way they found by the walles of the citie a tombe of
white marble ready made very fayre, and couered very trym
and fyt with a couer of the same stone: wherby vnderstanding
that our Lorde hadd prospered their iourney, they gaue him
thankes therefore, and browght it to the monasterie. And
when the graue was opened and the body of the holy virgin
and spouse of Christ taken owt into the light, it was found so
cleane from corruption, as if she had dyed or bene put in the
grownd the very same daye, euen as bothe the aforesayd by∣shop
Wilfride, and many other that knewe it, beare wytnesse.
But Cinfride a certaine phisition, whiche was present by her
bothe when she dyed and when she was taken owt of the tom∣be,
was wonte of more certaine knowledge to tell, that when
<PB N="134" REF="149"/>
she lay sicke she had a very great swelling vnder her arme pit,
and they bad me, quoth he, to launce that swelling, that the yll
humour that was within might issue owt. Which when I had
done, for the space of two dayes after she semed to be some∣what
better at ease, so that some thowght that she might be cu∣red
of her grief. But the third day her former paynes tooke
her againe, and straight way was she taken owt of the worlde,
and chaunged all paine and death with health and life euerla∣sting.
And when after so many yeres her bones showld be
taken owt of the graue, they spred a tent ouer the same, and all
the company of the bretherne on the one syde, and systers on
the other, stode round about synging and the Abbesse with a
fewe other went in, to take vp and bring forth the bones. But
sodainly we heard her within crye owt withe a lowde voyce,
Glorie be to the name of God. And anon after, they called
me in, opening the entraunce of the tente, where I sawe the bo∣dy
of the holy virgin of God being taken out of the tombe,
and lyeng on the bead like one that were a slepe. Then dyd
they also open the couering of her face, and shewed me the
wound of the cut, that I had made, healed and cured, so that in
meruailous wyse in the place of the open and gaping wound
wherwith she was buried there appered than but litle smal sig∣nes
of the scar. Byside this, all the lynnen clothes, wherein the
body was winded appered hole and so newe, that they semed
to be put abowt those chast lymnes but that very daye. And
the report is, that when she was grieued with the forsayd swel∣ling
and paine of her cheeke bone and necke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVhat burdens are borne now a da∣yes of lesse then kin∣ges chil∣dren, and yet no grief felt at all?</NOTE> she tooke great
ioye in this kind of disease, and was wont to saye: I knowe
most certainly, that I worthely doo beare this bourden of pai∣ne
in my necke, in which I remember that when I was a gyr∣le,
I did beare the superfluouse and vaine bourdens of tablet∣tes
and owches, and I beleue that the soueraine pitie of God
doth therefore send me this grief and paine in my necke, that
<PB REF="150"/>
he may so absoyle and quit me from that gylte of vanitie and

In the battaill aboue mencioned among other of the soul∣diers
a certaine yonge man named Imma was left for dead:
which when he had all that day and night following lyen
among the bodies of the slayne men, lyke as he had bene dead
also, at laste receaued ayre and breath and reuiued againe, and
sate vp, and bound his woundes him selfe, as well as he could

seeking where he might fynd some fryndes to see to him and
helpe him. But as he so did, he was found and taken of his ene∣mies
of the other campe, and brought vnto their Lord, who
was an Erle subiecte to king <HI>Edilred.</HI> Of whome being dema∣unded,
what he was, he feared to cōfesse that he was a souldier,
and thought better to answer that he was a poore husband
man of the countre, and one that had wyfe and children,
and that he came forth with such other as he was to bring vit∣tailes
to the souldiers. But for all this the sayd Lorde suspected
him and willed his woūdes to be looked vnto: and when he be∣gan
to wex hole, he cōmaunded him at night season to be kept
in bondes, least he should scape away: but beholde no bondes
could holde him, but as sone as they were gone that had bound
him, his bondes and fetters wer straight way loosed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An exam∣ple for the cōfir∣matiō of purgato∣ry.</NOTE> For he had
a brother, whose name was Tūna, a priest and Abbot of a mo∣nastery
in the citie, which of his name is called vnto this day
Tunnacester: who when he heard that his brother was slaine
in the battaile came to seeke, if he might happely fynd his bo∣die.
Where he finding one that was in all pointes like him, and
thinking it to be him in dede, brought him to his monasterie,
and buried him honorably, and did often times cause masse
to be saied for his soule: By the saying of which masses
<PB N="137" REF="152"/>
that, which I sayd, came to passe, that noman could bynd him,
but that he was straight way loused againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sa∣crifice of the Masse propitia∣tory.</NOTE> Then the Erle that
kepte him began to wonder here at, and to enquire of him,
what the cause was that he coulde not be bound, and whether
perhaps he had about him any loosing letters, such as men tal∣ke
of that he could not be bound by the vertue of them. But
he aunsweared, that he knewe no such arte nor conning: but
I haue a brother, quod he, in my countre, one that is a priest
and I knowe that he thinkes I am slaine, and therefore doth oft
saye masse for me: and if I were nowe in an other world, my
sowle showld be there loused from paynes throughe his inter∣cessions
and prayers as my body is here from bondes. And
while he was thus kept a certaine space in the Erles howse,
some that marked him more diligently, sawe by his countena∣unce,
behauiour, and talke, that he was not (as he had sayd) of
the common poore sort of people, but of some good house and
degree. Therefore the Erle called him secretly, and exami∣ned
him more straightly of whence he was. Promising that
he wold doo him no harme in the world, if he wold playnly
vtter and shewe himselfe, what he was. Which thing when he
had done, and declared himselfe to be one of the kinges serua∣untes,
wel, quoth the Erle, I knewe by thy wordes and awnswe∣res,
that thow were no husbandman of the countre. And thou
art well worthy to dye nowe, for that all my bretherne and
kynnesmen were slaine in that battaile, yet I will not put the
to death, for breaking of my faith and promyse. And therfore
as soone as he was full cured, the Erle sent him to <HI>London</HI> and
solde him to a marchant of Friseland. But neither he, nor any
man els as he was lead thither, could bynd him by any meanes.
And yet his enemies dyd lay on him many and sundry kindes
of fetters which yet allwaies were loosed. When he that hadd
bowght him, sawe, that he cowld be kept and holden in no
bondes, he gaue him leaue to ransome himselfe, if he were able.
<PB REF="153"/>
For after abowt viij. a clocke in the morning when masses be∣gan
to be sayd, his bondes and fetters were euer lowsed. And
thus vpon his othe either to come againe, or els to send his ran∣some,
he was let go, and came to kent to kinge <HI>Lodhere,</HI> who
was sonne to the sister of Quene <HI>Edildrede</HI> of whom we haue

wold pay his ransome, which he obtained, and sent it (as he had
promised) to him whose prisoner he was. Afterward he re∣tourned
to his countree, and came to his brother, and declared
him in order all the aduersities that had happened vnto him,
and also what comfortes and succours he had had in the same.
And he knewe, by that his brother told him, that his bondes
were loosed at those times specially, in which masses were said

godly seruaunt of Christe Hilda Abbesse of the monasterie,
that is called Streanes halch (as we before mentioned) after ma∣ny
heauenly dedes that she did in this world, passed owt of this
lyfe to receaue the rewardes of the lyfe of heauen, the xvij. day
of Nouember, when she was three score and six yeres of age.
The which nomber of yeres equally diuided into two partes,
she lyued, the first xxxiij. in secular lyfe withe most noble and
worthy conuersatiō, and as many after did she dedicate to our
Lord more nobly and worthely in monastical life. For she was
come of noble birth, and was the dawghter of kinge <HI>Edwins</HI>
nephewe named <HI>Hererike,</HI> with which kinge also at the prea∣ching
of <HI>Paulinus</HI> of blessed memorie the first bysshopp of
Northumberland, she receaued the fayth and sacramentes of of
Christe, and dyd syncerely kepe the same, vntill she deser∣ued
to come to his sight and vision, whome only to serue after
she had determined, and forsaken this secular lyfe and world,
she went to the prouince of the East english. For she was allied
to the king there, and from thence she desyred, if she might by
any meanes, to forsake her countre and al that euer she had, and
go into Fraunce, and there in the monasterie named <HI>Cate</HI> to
leade a pilgrimes and exuls lyfe for our Lordes sake, that she
might the more easyly deserue to enioye an euerlasting coun∣tre
in heauen. For in the same monasterie her syster <HI>Heres∣wide</HI>
mother to <HI>Adulphe</HI> king of the East english did at the sa∣me
very tyme lyue vnder rules and disciplines of religion aby∣ding
and looking for the crowne euerlasting: whose example
she mynding to followe and liue a straunger out of her owne
countree, dyd abyde in the said prouince one hole yeare. After
which being called home againe into her countree by bisshopp
<HI>Aidan,</HI> she had deliuered her the landes of one Lordeship at the
north coast of the riuer Were, in which she liued also the space
of one yeare, and lead a monasticall lyfe with a fewe other of
her companie. After this she was made Abbesse in the mona∣sterie
<PB REF="154"/>
that is called <HI>Heortheu,</HI> which monasterie had bene buil∣te
not long before of the godly and deuout handmayed off
Christ <HI>Heiu.</HI> Which is said to be the first woman in the pro∣uince
of Northumberland, that tooke the vowe and habit of a
Nonne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vow and habit mo∣nasticall.</NOTE> being blessed and consecrated by bisshop <HI>Aidan.</HI> But
not long time after the making of the monasterie she departed
thence to the citie of <HI>Calcaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Colche∣ster.</NOTE> whiche is called of the english
men <HI>Calcacester,</HI> and there she appointed to abyde and contine∣we.
Now this other handmayd of Christ <HI>Hilda</HI> being placed
to rule this monasterie, dyd strayght procure to order and dis∣pose
the same in all pointes with regular lyfe and discipline, in
such wise as she could be best enstructed of them that were
learned. For both bishop <HI>Aydan,</HI> and as many religious per∣sons
as knewe her, for the great wysedome and loue to serue
God, that was in her, were wont ofte times to visit her, louin∣gly
to helpe her, and diligently to instructe her. Thus when
she had certaine yeres gouuerned this monasterie in great ob∣seruation
and straighnes of regular lyfe and order, it was her
chaunce to take in hand the buylding and disposing of a mo∣nasterie
in the place called <HI>Straneshalch,</HI> which busynes com∣mitted
vnto her she finished with all speede and diligence. For
she fournished and framed it with the same rules and orders of
regular lyfe, with which she had disposed the other monasterie
before. And truly she dyd there teache singularly the workes
of righteousnes, deuotion, chastitie, and other vertues, but spe∣cially
of peace and charitie, in such wise that after the example
of the primitiue church, there was none riche there, none poo∣re,
but all thinges common to all, for nothing semed peculiar
and priuate to any one. She was of such wysedome, that not
only all meane persons in their necessities, but also kinges and
princes dyd seke and find counsel of her: Such religious men, as
liued vnder her gouernāce, she made to bestow their time in the
reading of the holy scriptures, and in the exercise of the workes
<PB N="139" REF="154"/>
of vertue, that out of her monastery many might easely be fo∣unde,
mete and worthy mē to serue the church, and the aultar.
And in dede we haue sene in a short space fiue bishops oute of
the same monasterie, all, men of singular merite and holynesse,
whose names are these <HI>Bosa, Adda, Ostfor, Iohn,</HI> and <HI>VVilfride.</HI>
Of the first we haue spoken before, howe he was consecrated
bishop of <HI>Yorke.</HI> Of the second to speake shortly, he was made
bishop of <HI>Dorcister.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dorche∣ster in Barkeshe∣re.</NOTE> Of the two last we shall speake afterwar∣de,
of which the one was consecrated bishop of <HI>Hagulstad,</HI> and
the other of <HI>Yorke.</HI> Of the middlemost let vs nowe say some∣what.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In holy Ilond.</NOTE>
When he had in both the monasteries of Abbesse <HI>Hilda</HI>
diligently applied the reading and studieng of the scriptures, at
last desiring more perfecte exercises, he came to kēt to the Ar∣chebishop
<HI>Theodore</HI> of blessed memorie. Where hauing conti∣newed
a certaine space and spent his time in holy studies and
reading, he found also the meanes to go to Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Going to Rome ac∣compted a matter of deuotion in our primitiue church.</NOTE> which at that
time was counted a thing of great vertue and deuotion. From
thence retourning home againe to England, he went vnto the
prouince of the <HI>Victians</HI> ouer which king <HI>Osric</HI> raigned than,
and there he remained a long time, preaching the word of fai∣the,
and also giuing himselfe for an example of life to all that
knewe and heard him. At which time the bishop of that pro∣uince
named <HI>Boselus</HI> being so sicke and weake, that he could
not himselfe fullfill the office a bishop, by all mens iudgement
and consent the foresaid man was elected and chosen bishop in
his place, and at the cōmaundment of king Edilred was conse∣crated
by bishop <HI>VVilfride</HI> of blessed memorie, who at that ti∣me
was byshop of the Middleenglish. For <HI>Theodore</HI> tharchebis∣shop
was than dead, and none other as yet made bishop for
him. In which prouince a litle befor, that is to wytt, before that
foresaid man of God <HI>Boselus,</HI> one <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>frid</HI> a man most stout,
couragiouse and well learned and of an excellent wyt, was ele∣cted
bishoppe out of the monasterie of the said Abbesse: but he
<PB REF="155"/>
was taken away and died before his time, ere that he might be
consecrated. This foresaid handmayde of Christ Abbesse <HI>Hil∣da,</HI>
whome, all that knewe her, were wont to call mother for her
notable grace and godlinesse, was not only in her owne mo∣nasterie
an example of lyfe to them that were with her, but al∣so
to many other that were far of the ministred occasion of sal∣uation
and amendement, to whom the happy report of her do∣ing
and vertuous liuing came. And so was fulfilled the dreame,
that her mother <HI>Bregoswid</HI> had, when this was but an enfant.
For when her husband <HI>Heriric</HI> was out of his coūtre as an out∣lawe
vnder <HI>Cerdix</HI> kinge of the Britons, where also he was att
last poysonned, she sawe in a dreame, that he whom she sought
with al diligēce, was as it wer sodainly takē out of her sight that
no signe aud token of him any where did appere. But as she yet
busily sought for him, she foūd by and by a very pretious ouch
and iewel vnder his garmēt, which as she did wel marke and cō∣sider
it semed to shine and glister with brightnesse of so great a
lighte, that it filled all the borders of Britannie, with the grace
thereof. The which dreame was proued true in her doughter,
whome we speake of. Whose lyfe not to her selfe only but to
many other that wold lyue well, did geue examples of the
workes of light. But nowe when she had many yeres ruled this
monasterie, it pleased the mercifull worker of our saluation,
that her holy soule should also be examined and tried with
long sicknesse of the body, that after thexample of the Apost∣le,
<HI>her vertue might be made perfect in infirmitie and weakenesse.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 22.</NOTE>
For she was striken with feuers, and begā to be greuously vex∣ed
with the heate, and was in the same wise sicke and deseased
for the space of vj. yeres. In all which time she did neuer omit
and let passe, both, to giue thankes to her creatour, and also to
teache and enstructe openly and priuatly the flocke cōmitted
to her charge. For by her owne example she warned them all,
both to serue our Lorde dewly when he geueth them their bo∣dely
<PB N="140" REF="155"/>
health, and also thanke him continually and faithfully in
worldly aduersities, or bodely infirmities and sickenesse. And
thus the seuenth yere of her sicknesse, the grief and paine
tourning toward the hart and inward partes she came to her
ende and last day in this worlde, and about the crowing
of the cocke after she had receaued the viage prouision of ho∣ly
howsell she called vnto her he handmaides of Christ that
were in the same monasterie, whome as she admonished and
counselled to kepe the euangelicall vnite amonge them selues
and with other, at the very last worde and making of this her
exhortatiō she gladly and willingly saw the houre of her death
yea rather (to speke with Christs owne wordes) she passed from
death vnto lyfe. In which very night our almightie Lord vou∣chesafed
to reuele her death and departing by a manifest
and plaine vision in an other monasterie that was a good way
of, named <HI>Hacanes,</HI> the which she had buylt the same yere. For
there was in the same monasterie a certaine Nonne named
<HI>Begu</HI> which had serued our Lord in monasticall conuersation
and blessed virginitie xxx. yeres and more. This Nonne taking
her reast at that time in the dortour howse, heard sodainly in
the ayer the knowen sound of the bell, wherewith they were
wonte to be called vp to prayers, when as any of them was
called out of the worlde. And opening her eyes (as she
thought) she sawe the roofe and top of the house vncouered,
and all aboue full of light. Which light as she earnestly marked
and looked on, she sawe the soule of the foresayd handmaid
of God in that light caried vnto heauē, accompained and lead
by Angells. And as she then started out of her sleape, and sawe
other systers taking their reast about her, she knewe and per∣ceaued,
that that which she sawe was shewen her either in a
dreame or in some vision of minde. And by and by she rose vp
for ouermuch feare that she had, and ranne to the virgin, which
was then gouernesse of the monasterie in the Abbesse stede,
<PB REF="156"/>
whose name was Frigit, and with much weping and teares, and
drawing long sigthes told her that the mother of them al Ab∣besse
<HI>Hilda</HI> was nowe departed this worlde, and with a mer¦uailouse
great light, which she sawe, and company of Angells
leading her, ascended vp to the gates of euerlasting lighte and
felowship of the heauenly citisens. Which when she had heard,
she raised vp all the sisters, and called them to churche, wil∣ling
them to be occupied in prayers and psalmes for the soule
of their mother. Which thing as they diligently did the rest of of
the nighte, at the breake of the day there came certaine bre∣therne
from the place where she died, to bring worde of her
departing. Which the other aunswered that they knewe of
before. And when they had declared in order howe and when
they had learned the same, it was found that her passing was
shewed them by the vision at the very same houre, that
they reported her to passe out of the world. And with a goodly con∣sent
and agreement herein it was by the worke of God so dis∣posed,
that when the one sawe presently her departing out of
this lyfe, at the same time the other did knowe her entring in∣to
the perpetuall lyfe of soules. These two monasteries are
distant a sonder almost xiij. myles. It is also reported, that
in the same monasterie to, where the foresayd handmay∣de
of God died, one of those vowed virgins to God,
that loued her more then the rest had her departing shewed
vnto her the same night in a vision, and sawe her soule go to
heauen with angells, which thing the very same houre it was
done she opened and declared to those handmaydes of Christ
that were with her and called them vp to pray for her soule,
and that, before the reast of the company knewe of her depar∣ting:
which thing to be so, was anon after declared to the hole
company when morninge came. For at that houre this Nonne
was alone seuerally with certaine other handmaydes of Chri∣ste,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Howe the gyfte of synging was miraculowsly giuen to a certaine brother in the monasterie of this Abbesse.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The. 24. Chap.</HEAD>
<P>IN the monasterie of this Abbesse there was a certaine bro∣ther
notably endewed with the speciall grace of God, whi∣che
was wont to make songes and meters fit for religiō and
godly meditation, in so much that what so euer he learned of
the holy scriptures by other mens expounding, he tourned and
made the same anon after with poeticall and musicall wordes
set together withe wonderfull swetenesse and melodie in his
owne mother tonge. With whose verses and songes the min∣des
of many men were ofte enflamed to the contempt and de∣spysing
of the world, and desire of the euerlasting lyfe of hea∣uen.
After whome diuerse other among the english men as∣sayed
to make godly and deuowt meters, but noman cowlde
matche his connyng therein. For he learned this arte of sin∣ging
and making, not towght of men, nor by any mans helpe,
but he receaued the gyfte therof freely by the only ayde and
grace of God. And therefore he cowld neuer make any fond or
vayne balade, but such things as belonged to religion and god∣ly
meditation were only mete to come owt of his religiowse
and godly mowth. For as long as he was a secular man, which
was, tyll he was well striken in age, he neuer had learned any
such matter of singinge. In so much that sometimes at the
table, when the company was set to be mery, and agreed for the
nonse, that eche man showld syng in order at his cowrse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he,
when he sawe the harpe to come nere him, rose vp at myds of
supper, and gat him owt of doores home to his owne howse.
And as he so dyd on a certaine time, getting him owt of the
<PB REF="157"/>
place where they were drinking and making mery together, to
the stable among the beastes which he had appoynted him to
kepe and looke to that nighte, and when the howre of slepe
came, was gone his way quietly to bed, as he laye, he dreamed
that acertaine man stoode by him, and bad him, God spede,
and calling him by his name, sayd to him, <HI>Cednom,</HI> I pray thee
singe me a songe. Whereto he made awnswere and sayd, I can
not synge. For that is the matter why I came owt from the
table to this place here, bicause I cowld not singe. But yet,
quoth he againe that spake with him, thow hast somewhat to
syng to me. What shall I syng? quoth he. Sing, quoth the o∣ther,
the begynning of al creatures. At which awnswere he be∣gan
by and by to singe in the lawde and prayse of God the
creatour, verses which he had neuer heard before, of which the
sense and meaning is thys. <HI>Nowe must we prayse the maker of
the beauenly kingdome, the power of the creatour, his cownsell
and deuyse, the workes and actes of the father of glorie. Howe he
being God eternall was the maker and author of all miracles, whiche
first vnto the children of men created heauen for the top of their dwel∣ling
place, and after the omnipotent keper of mankinde created the
earthe for the flowre thereof.</HI> This is the meaning, but not the
order of the wordes which he sange in his sleape. For verses
be they neuer so wel made can not be tourned out of one tonge
into an other word for worde, without leasing a great pece of
their grace and worthynesse. Now when he awooke and rose
vp, he remembred stil by harte all the thinges that he had songe
in his slepe, and dyd straight way ioyne thereto mo wordes in
the same maner and forme of meter, and made vp a song fytte
to be songe and applyed to God. And on the morowe he came
to the farmar or baylie vnder whome he was, and tolde him of
the gifte that he had receaued, and being browght to the Ab∣besse
he was commaunded in the presence of many learned
men to tell his dreame, and rehearse the song, that it might by
<PB N="142" REF="157"/>
the iudgement of them all be examyned and tryed, what or
whence the thing was which he reported. And it semed to
them all, that some heauenly grace and gifte was graunted
him of our Lorde. For more triall whereof they recited vnto
him the processe of some holy storie or example, willing him,
if he cowld to tourne the same into meter and verse. Which he
tooke vpon him to doo and went his way, and on the morowe
after came againe and browght the same made in very good
meter, which they had willed him to doo. Whereupon straight
way the Abbesse acknowledging and embracing this grace and
gifte of God in the man, enstructed and exhorted him to for∣sake
the world, and the lyfe thereof, and to take the monasticall
lyfe and profession vpon him. Which he did and was thereu∣pon
by the commaundment of the Abbesse placed in the com∣pany
of the bretherne, and by her appointement tawght and
enstructed in the course of holy scripture. But he what soe∣uer
he cowld heare and learne, would afterwarde thinke vpon
the same againe by him selfe, and chewinge theron lyke a cle∣ane
beast at his cudd, would turne it into very swete meter,
and melodiously singinge the same, made his teachers to be∣come
his hearers againe. His songes were of the creation
of the world, and beginnyng of mankynd, and al the storie of
Genesis, of the going of Israel out of Aegipt, and their entring
into the land of promise, and of many other histories of the
holy scriptures. Of thin carnation of our Lord, of his passion,
resurrectiō, and ascensiō into heauē, of the cōming of the holy
ghost, of the doctrine and preaching of the Apostles. Also he
was wont to make many songes and meters of the dread of
domes day and iudgement to come, of the horrible paynes of
hell, and of the ioyes and swetenes of the kingdome of heauen.
And many other also of the benefits and iudgementes of God.
In al which, his endeuour was to pull away men from the loue
of wickednesse, and styrre them vp to the loue and readinesse
<PB REF="158"/>
of vertue and good lyfe. For he was a man very deuout and re∣ligiouse,
and humbly obedient to his rules and disciplines. And
very zelouse and feruently bent against them that would doo
otherwise. And therefore he ended his lyfe with a good ende.
For when the houre of his departing was at hande, he was ta∣ken
before and diseased xiiij. dayes with bodyly sickenesse, and
yet so temperatly, that he might all that tyme both speake and
walke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry.</NOTE> There was there by, a litle house into whiche they that
were sicke were wont to be brought, and such as were lykely
shortly to dye. This man desyred him that serued him, the same
eueninge before the night that he should depart out of the
world, to go and prouide him a place to reast and lye in that
house. The other maruailed why he desired the same, for he
was nothing likely to dye so sone. But yet he did as he was bid.
When they were there placed, and were meryly talking and
sporting amonge themselues and them that were there before,
being now about midnight he asked and enquired of them all,
whether they had the sacrament there within. What nede,
quoth they, is there of the sacrament, for your tyme is not co∣me
to dye yet, that are so meryly talking with vs, as a man in
good health.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reseruati∣on of the blessed Sa¦crament.</NOTE> But yet, quoth he againe, doo ye bring me hither
the sacrament. Which when he had taken in his hand he asked
them, whether they were all of a quiet minde and persit chari∣tie
toward him, without any quarell, grudge, debate, and ran∣cour.
They aunsweared all, that they were of very good mynd
and will toward him, and far from al wrath and displeasure: and
they asked him againe, whether he bare good will and affe∣ction
toward them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Howse∣ling befo∣er death.</NOTE> He aunsweared by and by, I do beare, my
dere children, a quiet and good mynd to all Gods seruauntes.
And there withall arming him selfe with that heauenly foode
made him ready to enter into the other lyfe. Then he asked,
howe nyghe the houre was, that the bretherne should ryse to
saye their night laudes and seruice to our Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> It is not far of,

quoth they. Wel than, quoth he, let vs abyde and tarie for that
houre. And blessinge himselfe with the signe of the holy cros∣se<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blessing with the signe of the crosse.</NOTE>
he layd downe his head on the bolster, and so falling a litle
in a slomber ended his lyfe in quiet and silence. And thus God
wrought with him, that euē as he had serued our Lord with a
simple, plaine, pure mynde and quiet deuotion, so lykewise he
might come to the fight and vision of God, leauing this worl∣de
with a quiet and still death. And that also the tounge whi∣che
had made and inuented so many goodly meters and hole∣some
wordes in the prayse of the creatour of all, might conclu∣de
and shut vp the last wordes in the praise and lawde of the
same, blessing himselfe, and commending his spirite into the
hands of our Lord. It appereth also by these thinges that we

dyd mercifully whippe them euen at the beginning, that being
thereby corrected they might lyke the <HI>Niniuites</HI> tourne awaye
the wrath of the iust iudge from them by fastings, weaping,
and prayers. In the same monasterie there was a certaine man
a Scotborne named <HI>Adaman,</HI> leading a very deuout lyfe vnto
God in chastitie, abstinence and prayer, in such sort, that he
neuer dyd eate nor drinke, saue only eche Sonday and thurs∣day:
and oftētimes also he passed ouer whole nightes watching
<PB REF="159"/>
in prayer: which straightnes of hard lyfe he began at the first
of dewtie and necessitie to amend his former syn and ylliuing,
but in processe of time he had tourned that necessitie into a
continuall custome. For whereas in his youth he had commit∣ted
a certain greuouse offense and sin, that coming ofte to
his mynd and remembrance, considering in his hart the great∣nes
thereof, he abhorred it and trembled therat excedingly, and
feared the pounishement of the sharp iudge vppon him for the
same. Resorting therefore to a priest and hoping of him to
lerne some remedy of saluation, he confessed his syn to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cōfessiō to the priest.</NOTE>
and desyred him to giue him counsell, whereby he might flee
and escape the wrath of God and vengeaunce to come. The
priest when he had heard his offense and sin, said. A great woū∣de
requireth a greater cure and medicine: and therefore geue
thy selfe to fastinges, and prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 94.</NOTE> as much as thou art able, to
the ende that <HI>coming before the face of our Lorde in confession</HI>
thou maiest deserue to fynde him mercifull vnto thee. But he
for the passing grief of the giltie conscience that held him, and
desyre that he had to be sone assoyled of the inwarde bondes
of synnes wherewith he was laden, sayd: I am yonge of age,
and strong of bodie. And therefore what soeuer ye put me vn∣to,
so that I may be saued in the day of our Lorde, I will easely
beare it all, and thoughe ye bid me to stand the whole night

in abstinence. It is very much (quod the priest) to en∣dure
the whole weke without sustenaunce of the bodie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penaunce enioyned.</NOTE>
but it suffiseth to faste two or three daies at onse. And this doo
thowe vntill I come againe to the after a short time, and shewe
thee more fully what thou must doo, and howe long thou
must continewe in penaunce. After which wordes the priest
appointed him what penaunce he shoulde doo, and went his

fasted all the other daies of the weke. And when he had
heard that his ghostly father was gone into Ireland, and there
departed, euer after from that time he kept this maner of fa∣sting,
according as it was first appointed him. And the thing
which he had onse begon to doo for compunction of his syn
and dread of Gods vengeance, the same did he nowe, without
lothesomnesse or werynesse, yea with pleasure and delight for
the reward that followed, and for the feruent loue of God.
And as he nowe long time had continewed diligently the sa∣me,
it chaunced that on a certaine day he went out of the mo∣nasterie
to some place a good way of, hauing one of the bre∣therne
with him in his companye. And when they had done
their iourney and were comming home againe, drawing nere
the monasterie they beheld and vewed the goodly high buil∣ding
of the same, wherat the man of God brast out all into tea∣res,
and with his weping countenaunce bewrayed the heauy∣nes
of his harte. Which thing when his fellowe sawe, he asked
him why he so did. O quod he, al these buildinges that you see,
both the common that belong to many, and the priuate hou∣ses
of particular persons shall shortly be tourned into ashes and
consumed by fyre. Which he hearing, as sone as they came
into the monasterie, found the meanes to tell that to the mo∣ther
of the couent, named Ebba. Who being troubled at such a
warning and fortelling, as good cause was, sent for the mā vn∣to
her, and enquired the whol matter of him diligētly, and how
he knewe the same. Of late, quod he, being occupied at night
time in watching and saying of psalmes, I sodainly sawe one
stand by me, of a straunge and vnknowen fauour. At whose
<PB REF="160"/>
presence when I was sore afraide, he bad me not to feare, and
then in familiar wise he spake to me thus and sayd. Thou doest
well in that this night time of reast, thou hast had the strength,
not to geue thy selfe to ease and sleape, but to be occupied
in watching and praying. Whereto I aunswered and sayd,
that I knewe my selfe to haue great nede to continewe in ho∣lsome
watching, and to make diligent and dewe intercession
to our Lord for my synnes. Thou sayest true, quod he farther,
that thou and many other haue nede to redeme and satisfie for
their synnes with good workes, and at such time as they are at
leasure from worldly paines and busynesse, to labour the mo∣re
freely for the desyre of euerlasting wealth: but yet very fewe
doo so. For right nowe haue I walked through all this mona∣sterie
in order, and looked in euery selle and bead, and of them
all, sauing thee, haue I found not one occupied aboute the sa∣uing
of his owne soule: but they are all both men and wemen
either depely drowned in sleape, or watching vnto wickednes
and syn. For the litle houses that were made to pray or reade
in, are nowe tourned into chambers of eating and drinking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abuses of religious persons punished by God from hea∣uen.</NOTE>
and talking, and other enticemente of yll. And the virgins, vo∣wed
vnto God, contemning the reuerence and regard of their
profession, as ofte as they haue any leasure thereto, do occupie
themselues in weauing and making fine clothes, wherewith
they may set forth themselues lyke brydes, to the daunger and
great perill of their estat and professiō: or els to get thē the loue
of strangers and men abrode. And therefore is there worthely
prepared from heauen for this house and them that dwel ther∣in
a greuouse punishment and vengeance by fyre. Then quod
the Abbesse, And why wold ye not soner tell me herof when
ye knewe it? Forsooth, quod he, I feared so to doo for respecte
of you, least ye wold perhap be ouermuch troubled therewith.
And yet take ye this comfort herein, that this plage and puni∣shment
shall not fall in your dayes. This vision being spread
<PB N="145" REF="160"/>
abrode and knowen, they of the place began somewhat to
feare for a fewe daies, and to amend them selues, and leaue
their naughty lyfe. But after the death of the Abbesse they
retourned to their old naughtynesse, yea and to worse to. And
when they sayd and thought themselues in peace and saftie,
they were anon stricken with the punishment of the foresayd
vengeance. All which thinges to haue bene thus done in dede,
the most Reuerend Giles my felow priste reported vnto me,
who lyued than in the monastery: and afterward, (for that
many dwellers there went thence bycause of this ruyn) lyued a

warne the reader and put him in mynd of the workes of owr

of Ebbercune, the which standeth in the Englysh region, but

the first beginning of his childhode was alwaies feruently de∣syrouse

which standeth on the banke of the riuer Tyne, and was
at that time gouuerned of Abbot <HI>Eata,</HI> the mekest and mil∣dest

where both by the authoritie of his master, and example of his
owne dooing he instructed and brought many vnto regular
lyfe and discipline.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The life of S. Cut∣bert being yet a mon¦ke.</NOTE> Neither did he only giue vnto the mona∣sterie
both admonishementes and examples of vertuouse and
regular lyfe, but also laboured to tourne the common people
far and nere thereabout from the lyfe of their carelesse conuer∣sation,
to the loue and longing of the ioyes of heauen. For ma∣ny
folke at that time did profane and defyle the fayth that they
had with wicked workes and dooinges, some also in the time
of the great death and plage, setting at nought the sacramen∣tes

and coning of the deuill to staye and kepe of the plage sent
from God the creatour. Both which sortes of people to cor∣recte,
and reproue their erroneouse and yll dooing this good
father would go out of the monasterie somtime on horsebac∣ke,
but moo times on fote, and come to the villages lyeng the∣reabout,
and preache the way of truthe to them that were a∣straye.
Which thing also <HI>Boisill</HI> was wont to doo in his tyme.
For it was the maner of the people of England at that time,
that when any of the clergy or any priest came to a village,
they would all by and by at his calling come together to heare
the worde, and willingly harken to such thinges as were saied,
and more willingly followe in workes suche thinges as they
could heare and vnderstande. Nowe this man <HI>Cutbert</HI> had
such a grace and skill in vtteraunce, such a zele in persuading,
such an Angels face and countenaunce, that none that was
present durst presume to hyde the secrettes of his hart from
him: but dyd all openly declare in confession the thinges that
they had done: both for that they thoughte that the same could
in no wyse be hid from him, and also that they might be shry∣uen
and cleansed from their synnes throughe the dewe frutes
of penaunce as he should appoint them. This good man was
wont to resorte vnto those places and villages most common∣ly
that stoode a far of in stipye and craggie hylles, and whiche
other men were afraid to come at, or els being lerned lothed to
visit bicause of the vnsemely dwelling and vplandish rudenesse
of the inhabitants. And yet he dyd so ioyefully giue himselfe to
this godly and charitable labour, and so diligently instructed
them with good and holesome doctrine, that he would go out
of the monasterie oftetimes, and not come home againe in an
whole weke, sometimes not in two or three, yea not in a
whole moneth, but all that time tarie in the hylles among the
poore folke of the countree, exhorting them to the ioyes of
<PB REF="163"/>
heauen both with the worde of preaching, and worke of ver∣tuouse
example. When this reuerend seruante of our Lord had
lyued many yeares in the monasterie of <HI>Mailros,</HI> and excelled
in great signes of vertues, the most reuerend Abbot there <HI>Eata</HI>
remoued him to the yle of Lindesfarne, that he might there
also set forth to the bretherne the keping of regular discipline
both with the authoritie of an head and ruler, and also expresse
and shewe the same by his owne doing and example. For this
most reuerend father did at that time gouuerne the same place
as Abbot there of. Though of olde time in that place both the
bishop was wont to abyde together with his clergie and mini∣sters
of his church, and the Abbot with the monks, who did al∣so
notwithstanding belong to the houshould, and cure of the
bishop. For <HI>Aidā</HI> which was the first bishop of that place, came
thither with monkes being also a monke himself, and did there
place and begyn monasticall lyfe and conuersation: e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en as be∣fore

vertues both in heroicall verse, and in prose, yt shall suffise at
this present only to rehearse this much, that at his going to the
iland he protested to the bretherne and sayd: If the grace and
goodnes of God doo graunt me in that place, that I may liue
by the worke of mine owne hande I will gladly abyde there:
if not I will God willing very shortly retourne to you againe.
Now this place was quite destitute both of water and graine
and wodde, and also not mete for any man to dwell in bicau∣se
of the wicked spirits and fendes that haunted there. Yet at
the prayer and desyre of the man of God it became such in all
respecte, that it mighte well inough be enhabited. For at his
comming the euill spirits went their way. Which enemies be∣ing
so driuen out, and that he had made himselfe a narrowe
and small dwelling place, compassed about with a trenche, and
with the helping hand of the bretherne had bylded necessarie
howses in the same, that is to saye, a chappell and a common
dwelling place, he commaunded the brethern to make a pyt in
the pauement of the same dwelling place. Which they did, and
yet the earth was very hard and stonye, and semed not to haue
any moisture in the world, nor any vaine of water or spring in
it. But the next day at the faith and praiers of the seruaunt of
God, the pyt was found full of water, which vnto this day doth
geue sufficient vse and aboundance of that heauenly grace to
all that come thither. Beside this he desyred to haue ploughing
tooles brought him and wheate withall, and when he had la∣boured
and made ready ground before and sowen it in dewe
season, it so happened that at the very time of sommer ther gre∣we
therof not only no eares, but not so much as any blade or
grasse. Wherefore when the bretherne came to visit him as
their maner was, he willed barly to be brought him, to see if
happely the nature of that soile, or the will of the highe
geuer were, that the sede of that graine could growe any better
<PB REF="164"/>
there. Which when it was brought him, and that he had sowen
it in the same field, out of all season of sowing, and out of all
hope of hauing any frute againe, yet there arose and
grewe vp anon corne plentifully, and gaue to the man of
God the ioyfull refresshing and sustenaunce of his owne la∣bour.
And when he had there serued God solitarily many ye∣res
(for the banke wherewith his house was compassed and
trenched about was so highe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Synod of the en∣glish church.</NOTE> that he could see nothing
els out of it, but heauen, which he thyrsted and longed to en∣ter
into) it happened at the same time, that there was a great
synode assembled in the presence of king <HI>Egfride</HI> by the riuer
of <HI>Alua,</HI> at a place called <HI>Atwiforde,</HI> which signifieth as much,
as, at the two fordes, in which Archebisshop <HI>Theodore</HI> of blessed
memorie was president, and there this foresayd man with one
mind and consent of them all was chosen to be bishop of the
churche of <HI>Lindisfarne.</HI> Who when he could in no wise be dra∣wen
out of his monasterie for all the messengers and letters
that were sent him, at last the foresayd king himselfe hauing the
most holy bishop <HI>Trumwine</HI> with him and many other religi∣ouse
parsons and men of power and authoritie, did passe ouer
vnto the Iland. Also many of the bretherne of the ile of <HI>Lin∣desfar</HI>
came thither for this purpose: all which on their knees
most earnestly desyred and required him for Gods sake and
with weping teares in our Lords name they besought him so
longe, that they made his eyes stand full of swete teares to, and
so they gat him out of his caue, and brought him to the Syno∣de.
And when he came thither, though much againe his owne
will he was ouercomed by the one assent and will of all the
reast, and compelled to submit his necke to beare the yoke and
office of a bishop. And the wordes that forced him most, were,
that the seruaunt of God <HI>Boisil</HI> (who did with the propheticall
spirite he had, foreshew many things that should fall after him)
had also prophecied and fortelde that <HI>Cutberte</HI> should be bis∣shop.
<PB N="149" REF="164"/>
Nowe his consecrating not appointed to be straight way
but after the winter passed which then was at hand, in the feast

were weake and vnperfecte, knowing that he that sayed, <HI>Thow

and perfection of lyfe and maners named <HI>Hereberte,</HI> which
had a longe time bene coupled to this man of God in the
bond of spirituall loue and fryndship. For lyuing a solitary lyfe
in the yle of that great wyde lake, owt of which ronneth the
head and beginning of the ryuer of <HI>Derwent,</HI> he was wont to
visite Cutbert euery yere, and to heare the good lessons of eter∣nall

comming to the citie of <HI>Lugubalia,</HI> he came after his accusto∣med
maner desyryng to be enflamed more and more to the
blysse and ioyes aboue by his holesome exhortations. Who as
they sate together, and dyd inebriat one an other with the cup∣pes
of the lyfe of heauen, among other thinges the byshop sayd:
Remember brother <HI>Hereberte,</HI> that what soeuer ye haue to say
and aske of me, yow doo it nowe: for after we departe the one
from the other, we shall not mete againe and see one an other
with the eyes of the body any more in this world. For I knowe
well, that the time of my departing is at hand, and the laying
<PB N="150" REF="165"/>
away of my bodyly tabernacle shalbe very shortly. Which thin∣ges
when he heard, he fel downe at his feete, and with heauy si∣ghes
and powring teares I beseke yow (quoth he) for our Lor∣des
sake, forsake me not, but remember your most faythfull fel∣lowe
and companion, and make intercession to the high and
tender pitie of God, that we may departe hence vnto heauen
together to behold his grace and glorie, whome we haue in the
earth serued and honoured together. For yow knowe that I ha∣ue
euer studied and laboured to liue after your good and vertu∣ous
instructiōs, and what soeuer I offended and omitted throu∣ghe

gaue him selfe to his prayers, and anon being certified in

with all gladnesse. For the highe mercy of God hath gra∣unted
vs that we haue praied for. The truth of which promise
and prophecie was well proued in that which befell after. For

his bones: thinkinge to fynde them all drye, the bodye
being nowe consumed and brought to duste as dead bodies
commonly are, and so to put them in a newe toumbe, and laye
them againe in the same place, but somewhat aboue the floure
and pauement, for the more reuerence dewe thereunto. Which
<PB N="151" REF="166"/>
mynde and entent of theirs they did declare to <HI>Eadbert</HI> their
bisshop, who agreed to the same, and bad them remember to
doo it on the daye of his departing. And so they did. And
when they opened the tumbe, they founde the body all
whole and sounde, as if it were alyue, and the lymmes, ioyntes,
and synowes softe and pliable, muche liker a sleping bodye
than a dead. Also all the clothes, that were about hym, se∣med
not onely without wem or any blemish, but also as fresh
faire, and bright, as when they were newe and first made.
Whiche when the bretherne sawe, they were striken straight
with a great feare, and with all hast went to shewe there bys∣shopp
what they had found, who as it happened was that ty∣me
solitarie abyding alone in the farthest place from the chur∣che,
being closed rounde about with the flowing and ebbing
fluddes of the sea. For there was he wont alwayes to kepe
the tyme of Lent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deuo∣tion of bisshops in times past.</NOTE> and also xl. dayes before Christmas in gre∣ate
deuotion of abstinence, prayer, and teares. In which place
also his reuerend predecessour <HI>Cutberte</HI> before that he went
to the Ile of <HI>Farne,</HI> did at certaine tymes secretly serue our
Lorde in spirituall warfare. And they browght hym a part of
the clothes that were about the holy bodye. Which he both
receauing thankefully as acceptable presentes, and most glad∣ly
reioysing to heare of such miracles (for he kissed the clo∣thes
with a great affection as if they were yet about the fathers
bodye) put ye on (quoth he) newe clothes aboute the bodye
for these that ye have brought me, and so laye it againe in the
cheast that ye haue prouided therefore: I knowe moste cer∣tainly,
that that place shall not remaine longe emptie, which
is hallowed with such a speciall grace of this heauenly mira∣cle.
And howe happie is he, vnto whome our Lord the au∣thor
and giuer of all blysse will vouchesafe to giue leaue and
lycence to reaste in that place? These and many lyke thin∣ges
when the bysshoppe had sayed with many teares, and gre∣ate
<PB REF="167"/>
compunction, and trembling tounge, the bretherne dyd
as he had bydden them, and wounde the bodye in a newe clo∣the,
and put it in a newe cophin, and so layed it aboue the pa∣uement
of the chauncell. And shortely after the dere belo∣ued
of God <HI>Eadbert</HI> the byshopp was taken with a bytter
and burning disease, the which dayly encreased and waxed
more feruent, so that not longafter which, was the sixte day

And his body was also layed in the graue of the blessed father
<HI>Cutbert,</HI> with the cophim ouer him, in which they had put

<P>THere was in the same monasterie a certaine monke
named <HI>Beadwegen,</HI> whose office of longe time was to

dewly he doth the office put vnto him, only for the rewarde
that he looketh for aboue. This man on a certaine day when
he had washed in the sea the mantels or clothes that he occu∣pied
in the hospitall, comming home againe was in the myd
way sodainly taken with a paine in his bodie, in such wise that
he fell downe on the earth, and laye flat on the ground for a

rysen vp he felte the halfe part of his body from the head to
the fete to be greuously taken and stryken with a palsey, and
so with much paine he came home to the howse leaning on a
staffe. The disease grew and encreased litle, and litle: and when
night came, was waxen so greuouse and painfull, that the next
day he was scant able to ryse vp or go by himselfe. Into which
paine and aduersitie he being thus brought, conceaued in his
mynd a profitable way and counsell, which was to get him to
the churche by some meanes or other as well as he could, and
enter into the tombe of the blessed father <HI>Cutberte,</HI> and there
vpon his knees humbly to beseche the highe soueraine good∣nes
of God, that either he might be deliuered from the anguish
and paine, if it were so good and profitable for him, ot els if it
behoued him to be lōger chastened with that grief by the gra∣tiouse
prouision of God, that he might then patiently and
with meke mynd beare and suffer this paine and afflicton put

so he did in dede, and bearing vp and staying his feble lymmes
with a staffe he went into the churche, and there fell downe
prostrate at the corse of the man of God, praying with feruent
entent and deuotion that through his helpe and intercession
our Lorde wold be good and mercifull vnto him. And as he
was at his prayers falling as it were in a certaine softe slumber,
he felte (as he him selfe was afterward wont to tell) like as a

<HEAD>The. 32. Chapter.</HEAD>
<P>YET this one thing is not to be passed ouer or vnspoken
of, which three yeares passed was done by and at his
reliques, as was tolde me by the same man on who∣me
it was done. And it was in the monasterie, whiche
is buylt by the riuer of Dacore, and thereof hath his na∣me,
in whiche that time <HI>Switbert</HI> a good religiouse man
was head and Abbot. In that monasterie there was a cer∣taine
young man, that had a foule vnhansome swelling in the
lead of his eye, the which daily grewe bigger, and was lyke to
put him in danger of the losse of his eye. The physitians layed
salues and plaisters thereto to assuage the swelling, but they
could doo no good: some men wold haue it to be cut of, other
sayed no, for feare of a farther danger. And thus the foresayd
poore brother continewed in this case no small time, and could
get no helpe at mans hand against this perill of the losse of his
eye, but rather it daily encreased and waxed worse, till at last
it was his chaunce through the grace and goodnes of God to
be healed sodainly by the reliliques of the most holy fa∣ther
S. <HI>Cutbert.</HI> For when the monkes had found his bo∣dy
not rotten nor corrupted after it had many yeres lyen bu∣ried,
they tooke partes of the heare of his head, which in maner
of reliques they might giue or shewe for a signe of the miracle
to their fryndes when they came, and desyred the same. A litle
<PB N="153" REF="168"/>
parte of these reliques were at that time in this monasterie, in
the keping of one of the priestes there named <HI>Thridred,</HI> who
now is Abbot of the house. Which mā on a certaine daye went
to the churche and opened the shrine of reliques, to geue a par∣te
therof to afrynd of his. At what time it chaunced, the yong
man which had the sore eye, was present in the churche. And
when the priest had geuen his frynd such parte therof, as he
wold, he gaue the rest to the yong man to lay vp againe in his

sone as he had receaued the heares of the holy head, tooke thē
and put them to his sore eye, and helde them there a space to
kepe downe and assuage the greuouse swelling therewith. And
that done he layed the reliques vp againe in the shrine as he
was bidden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If they which now pre∣ach only faith, had such faith they should see such mira¦cles now.</NOTE> beleuing that his eye should shortly be healed by
the heare of the man of God, wherewith he was touched. And
his faith and belief deceaued him not. For it was at that ti∣me
(as he was wont to tel) about vij. of the clocke in the

<P>THE famous and reuerende father <HI>Aedilwalde,</HI>

<HI>Inripe,</HI> brought the office of priesthoode ta∣ken

that solytary and lonefull lyffe, which he passed in <HI>Farne</HI> island
before he was made bishoppe. Whose worthynesse and good
lyfe, that all men may more euidently perceaue, I will declare
one miracle wrought by him as one of the same company for
and in whome it was wrought, declared to me: to wit <HI>Gutfride</HI>
a faithfull seruante of Iesus Christe by vocation a priest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy Ilond.</NOTE> who
afterwarde was Abbot of the same church of Lyndisfarne whe∣re
he was brought vpp. I came (saide he) with ij. other off
my bretherne to <HI>Farne</HI> Island desyring to speake with the reue∣rend
father <HI>Aedilwald.</HI> And when we had talked with him a
whyle to our greate comforte, and afterwarde receiuing his
blessing haste nyd homewarde againe, beholde, sodainly as we
were in the mydest off the sea, the caulme in which we sayled
was taken awaye, and so greate a tempest and terrible storme
came vppon vs, that neither with sayle nor ower we coulde pre¦uaile,
nor presently looke for any thinge but deathe. And when
we striuing longe with the wynde and the seas to no effecte,
<PB N="154" REF="169"/>
looked backe at the lenght, if perchaunce by any possible mea∣nes
we might returne backe to the Iland agayne from whence
we came, we manifestly perceaued that on euery syde with lee∣ke
tempest our iourney was staied, and retourne intercepted:
and no hope of escape in our selfes: Afterwarde when we de∣scried
the lande a farre of and looked stedely towardes the
same, we sawe in <HI>Farne</HI> islande that vertuous and holy father
<HI>Aedilwalde</HI> come out of his caue to loke howe we sayled awa∣ye.
For as sone as he heard the blusteringe of the winde, and
rage of the Ocean sea, he came foorthe to see what might hap∣pen
and chaunce to vs. And when he sawe vs labouring harde
against the surges of the sea, and in cleane desperation of reco∣uering
the lande, he fell downe vppon his knees: and prayed to
almighty God, father of our Lorde Iesus Christ to deliuer vs
from that present daunger of death: And when he had ended
his prayer, he appeased the rage of the sea in such sorte, that the
violence of the storme all together ceasing, we had winde and
wether at will without any surges of the sea or greate waues
of water, vntill we came to lande. When we were on grounde,
and had layde our shippe at ancre, streytwayes the same storme
and tempest which for our sakes was a litle whyle alayed, be∣ganne
againe, and ceased not his rage all that daye, to thende
it might be geuen vs to vnderstand, that the litle caulme which
happened, was geuen of God from heauen at the contempla∣tion

sometime his deacon, but nowe Abbot of the monastery caul∣led
<HI>Inderwodde:</HI> a man woorthy of all reuerence and credit for

one or two to your memories. There is a secrett and solytary

him selffe most earnestly to prayer and studie, but specially
in the Lent. And when att a certaine tyme (lent being at hand)
he came thither to abyde after his accustomed manner, he
commaundid those that were aboute him to seeke some poore
begger, and impotent Lazar, whome he might haue wyth
him all the time of his continuaunce there, to extende his cha∣ritie
and deale his almes vnto. There was in a towne not farre
off, a younge man, that was dumme well knowen of the bis∣shoppe
(for he vsed to come before him oftentimes to receiue
his almes:) the which was neuer able to speake so much as one

in the crowne and hyer partes there coulde not a heare take

<PB N="155" REF="170"/>
commaunded to be brought thither, and a harbour made for
him within the precinct of his house, where he might ordinari∣lye
euery day receiue his almes: And when one weke of Lent

and shewe it vnto him, and takinge him by the chinne, ma¦de
a signe of the holy crosse vppon his tounge: and when he
had so signed and blessyd it, he commaunded him to plucke it

which in the english tounge is a worde off affirmation and
consent in such signification as yea, yea. Incontinent the strin∣ges
of his tounge were loosed, and he sayd that whiche he was
commaunded to saye. The bishoppe added certaine letters by
name and bid him say A: he said A. say B. he said B. and when
he had said and recited after the bishop the wholle crosse rewe,
he put vnto him sillables and hole wordes to be pronounced.
Vnto which when he aunsered in all pointes orderly, he com∣maunded

was abbesse. When we were there said he, and intertained
gently with good harte and chereful countinence of al, the ab∣besse
tolde vs that one of her couent and younge nonnes (whi∣che
was her owne daughter) beinge sicke, lay languishinge and
pininge awaye, because she was lett blood off late in her arme:
and while she was thinking off it in her fonde and foolyshe
fantasye, the sodayne payne made her very weake: whiche
growing vppon her more and and more, the arme where
the vaine was opened, waxed very sore, and so piteful∣ly
swollen, that a man coulde scarse clippe it with bothe his
handes, and she lyinge in her bed for the greate intolerable
paine semed to be almost dead and at the pitts brimme. Where∣fore
the Abbesse besought this good bishop to go in and bles∣se
her. Because she beleued stedfastly that if he did other blesse
her or touche her, the vehemency of her desease wolde cease,
and she shuld stratyways beginne to amende: He asked them
<PB N="156" REF="171"/>
when she was lett blood, and vnderstanding it was donne at
the prime of the mone, sayed, that it was very vnskilfully and
and vndiscretly donne to lett her blud at the prime of the mo∣ne.
I remember well (quod he) Archebishop <HI>Theodore</HI> (renou∣ned
among all his posteritie) tolde me that letting of blud and
opening the vaine was very daungerous about the first quar∣ter
of the moone, and rysinge of the sea. And what can I do for
this maiden, nowe she is at deathes doore? Not withstandinge
she besought him very instantly for her daughter, which she
loued tenderly (for she purposed to make her abbesse after her)
and at the lenght with much a doo obtained, so much of him
as to go into the chamber, and see the sicke maiden: Wherefore
he tooke me with him, and went to the maiden which lay lan∣guishinge
(as I said) with greate and intolerable paine in her ar∣me,
so swellinge that it coulde not once bowe at the elbowe.
And standinge there he sayd certaine prayers ouer her, and af∣ter
he had blest her, went out againe. When we had sate an
houre at the table, one came in and called for me, and leading
me a syde from the company, sayde, Coenburge (for that was
the maides name) desyreth you to come to her as sone as
you can. When I came in to the chamber I founde her very
cherefull and mery and as it were almost hole. And when I
had sate by her a whyle, shall we call for some drinke saide she?
mary with a good will quod I, and I am right glad you ar able
so to do. When we had bothe dronke, she beganne to declare
vnto me, that sense the bishoppe had prayed for her and blest
her, and went out of the chamber, she beganne to amend and
waxe better and better, and albeit I haue not recouered my for∣mer
strength againe, quod she, yet all the anguishe and paine,
is gone bothe out of my arme (where it was most feruent) and

company that came with him, some of the holy water, which
he hallowed in dedicatiō of the church, commaunding him to

yowng men that were in his company, especially of the lay

to haue licence to galloppe my horse and coorse vpp and do∣wne
with the other younge men (for I trusted well my horse,
which the bishop him selfe had before geuen me) I could not
preuaile at all. But when I sawe them take their horses vppe

with stoppe and turne, as could be, the bisshoppe and
I beholding all their pastime, I strayt waies ouercomed with
wanton courage could not stay my selfe, but went amongest
the thickest of them, and ranne with the best. And as I tooke
my horse vppe with the spurres, I heard him behynde my
backe, with a deape sigth, to saye. O mercifull God what wo∣full
woo, woorkest thou to me in ryding after thus sorte. I
heard those wordes, notwithstanding with willful will I min∣ded
to folow my pastime. And behold euen straightwaye as
my horse wilde, fearce, and couragious with greate violence
and force lept ouer a deeke by the waye, downe fell I to the
grounde, and as one ready to dye by and by, lost all my senses,
and was not able to moue any one ioyncte of my bodye. For
whereas in the same place lay a stone close to the grounde co∣uered
with a litle greene turffe, and not one other could be foū∣de
<PB REF="174"/>
in all that plaine vally and leuell grounde, it fortuned by
chaunce, or rather by the diuine prouidence off God to punis∣she
my disobedience it happened, that I pitched vppon the sa∣me
stone with my head, and hande which in the fal I putt vn∣der
to stay my self, and so broke my thumme, and sculle off my
head, that (as I said before) I lay there leeke a dead man ready
for his graue. And bicause I coulde not be remoued thence,
they stretched foorth a pauilion, and made me a lodging the∣re.
This was aboute seuen of clocke in the morninge: from
that houre vntill night I taried there with out any noyse or
disquietnes euen as it had ben a dead man: than I beganne to
reliue and came to my selfe againe, and was caried home to the
bishops lodging, by certaine of my fellowes where I lay speach∣lesse
al that night, casting and vomiting blud, because my bulc∣ke
and ynner partes, were sore broysed with the fal. But the bis∣shop
for the tender affectiō and singular good fansie he bare to
me, was meruailous sory for my misfortune and deadly woun∣de,
and woulde not all that night after his accustomed manner
tarry with his clergy, but continuing alone in watch all that
night, as I may well coniecture, besought the goodnesse of all∣mighty
God for my health and preseruation. And cominge to
my, chamber early in the morninge, said certaine prayers ouer
me, and called me by my name, and when I waked, as it were
oute of a greate slumber, he asked me, if I knewe, who it was
that spoke to me. And I casting vpp my eyes, saied yea right
well, you ar my dere bishop and master: than said he can you
recouer or liue? Yea quoth I, by yower good prayers if it please
God. So streytwaies laying his hand vppon my head, and re∣peting
the worde of benediction returned again to his praiers,
and coming to see me againe a litle while after, founde me fit∣ting
vppe in my bed, and well able to speake. Then moued, as
it were with some inspiration from heauen, asked whether I
knewe without all scruple and dowte, whether I was baptized
<PB N="159" REF="174"/>
or no: to that I aunswered, yea forsothe I knowe with oute all
doute I was wasshed in the holly fonte of baptisme in remis∣sion
of synnes, and knowe the priestes name very well that
baptized me: but he foorthwith replyed saying: if you were
christened of him doubtlesse you are not well christened: for I
knowe him well, and am right assured that when he was made
priest he coulde not for his dulheddid witt lerne, nor to in∣structe
nor to baptise. And for that cause I straightly chardged
him not to presume to that mynisterie which he could not do
accordingly: As sone as he had spoken those wordes he began∣ne
to instructe and informe me in the faith againe: and it came
to passe that as he breathed in my face, the payne vanished a∣waye,
and I felt my body much better than it was before. Than
he called for a surgion, and commaunded him to sett my skull
againe, and knitt it vpp together as it should be, and by and by
with his blessing I was so well recouered, that the next daye I
was able to mounte to my horse and ride with him to the next
place where he minded to lodge: And not longe after being
fully recouered I was baptized. This good bisshopp continued
in the see, three and thirty yeres, and so translated thence to the
ioyfull kingdome of heauen, lyeth buried in sancte Peters por∣che,
in a monastery called Inderwodde the yeare of our Lor∣de.

to preache ayding and assisting them with his princely au∣thoritie
that no man should by violence iniury them, or inter∣rupte
their preachinge, and also bountifully rewarding all such
as would embrace and receiue the faithe. Whereby it came to
passe by the assistaunce of Gods grace that in shorte tyme they
conuerted very many from idolatrie to the faith of Christ.</P>
<P>After the example of these holy men, ij. other englishe prie∣stes
which had voluntarily liued in banishment a longe tyme
in Ireland for hope of aeternall lyfe, came to Saxonie, if happe∣ly
by their preaching they might winne any to Christ. As these
good men had leeke deuotion, so had they bothe one name,
being bothe called Henwalde. Yet for diuersitie to knowe one
from the other, one was called blacke Henwalde, and the other
white Henwalde, because of the diuerse colour of their heare:
Bothe of them had a greate zeale, and reuerend loue to Chri∣stes
religion. But blacke Henwalde was the better diuine. They
coming into the countrey, went to a farmers house, and desired
they might be conducted to the Lorde, which had the rule and
gouuernaunce there, saying they had an embassy, and other
matters of importaunce to declare vnto him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gou∣uernemēt of the old Saxons.</NOTE> For the olde Sa∣xons

<PB REF="179"/>
the warres indured, and obediently exequuted what so euer he
commaunded. When the warres were done, all the Lordes wer
equal in powre and authority againe, as they were before. The
farmer intertained these good men, and promising to conduct
them to the Lorde of the soyle according to their request sta∣ied
them iij. or iiij. dayes in his house. When they were espied
of the rude barbarous people, and knowen to be of an other
religion, (for they soonge hymnes, psalmes, and other deuoute
prayers, and saied masse, hauing with them bookes, and holy
vessells, and a litle table hallowed, in stede of an aulter) they
had them in ieolosy, and suspicion that if they came to the
Lorde and talked with him, they would turne him quite from
worshipping of their gods, and bringe him to the new religion
of Christes faith. Wherby a litle and litle all the whole country
should be enforced to chaunge the old auncient manner of

and after they had murdred thē cast thē into the riuer of Rhene.
This fact when the Lord of the coūtry (whom they desyred to
see) vnderstoode, he was very angry, that straungers repayring
to him, could not haue free passage. And streytwais sending
forth his men of armes slew all the inhabitaunts of the same
village, and burnt their houses downe to the grounde. Those
good priestes, and faithfull seruants of our Sauiour Christe
suffred the third day of Octobre: and to testifye their Martir∣dom
vnto the wordle, there lacked no miracles from heauen.
For when their bodies were cast of the paynims, (as we signi∣fied
before) into the ryuer Rhene, it so fortuned that they were
caried against the maine runninge streame, almost xl. miles,
where their companions were, and a greate bright beame of
light reaching vp to heauen shyned euery night ouer the pla∣ce,

whersoeuer they came, they them selues that had cruelly
murdered them beholding and seing the same. Moreouer one
of them appered by vision in the night to one of their compa∣nions,
whose name was <HI>Tilmon,</HI> (a noble man of great renow∣ne
in the worlde, who from the high degre of a knyght beca∣came
a monke) shewing that he might finde their bodies
in that place, where he should see a light shyne from heauen.
The which came so to passe. And their bodies being fo∣unde,
they were buried with all honour worthy for such holy
martires. And the day of their Martirdome, or rather of the fin∣dings
of their bodies, is kepte solemne and holy in those par∣ties
with much deuotion and reuerence. Finally when that
worthy and renouned Captaine of the frenchmen named Pi∣pine,
had vnderstanding of this, he caused their bodies to be
buried very honourably in the church of Coollen, a famous
citie situated harde by the riuer Rhene: Besides it is commonly
saied, that in the place where they were kylled there spronge vp
a fountaine, which at this present day floweth with a greate

<HEAD>The. 13. Chap.</HEAD>
<P>THe very same time was wrought in Britanny a miracle
worthy of perpetuall remembraunce and not vnleke to
the olde auncient miracles of tymes past: for to stirre vp
and reuiue men lyuing here vppon earth from the death of
their soules, a certayne man starke dead for a tyme, rose from
death to lyfe, and tolde many notable thinges that he had seene,
of the which I thought it good to touche certayne briefly in
this historie: There was in the coast of Northumberlande (in a
place callyd Incunning) an honest householder of the countrie
which with all his family lyued a godly and vertous life: He
fell sicke, and by vehemency of his dysease growing more
<PB REF="181"/>
and more vppon hym, was brought to extremyty: and in the
beginnyng of the nyght died. But in the dauninge of the day,
reuiuing agayne, and fittinge vpp sodaynly: made all that re∣mained
aboute the corse, runne a way as men wonderfully a∣mased
with feare. Only his wife which loued him tenderly (al∣though
she tremblyd and quakyd) tarried still. And he comfor∣ting
her sayed, be not afraide. For I am nowe rysen in very de∣de
from death which had me as it were in prison, and am per∣mitted
to liue in earth amongst men againe, but not after the
same maner and trade as I did before. From hence forth my
conuersation must be farr vnleeke to my former life. And ry∣sing
by and by, he went to the paryshe churche and continuing
there in prayer vntill it was fayre day light forthwyth diuided
all his goods into thre partes: one parte he gaue to his wife, an
other to his children, the third he reserued to him selfe, and ma∣de
distribution of it straytways amongst the poore. Not longe
after dispatched of all worldly cares he went to the Monas∣tery

there vntill his dying day in such contrition of harte and

his life had testified that he had sene many thinges bothe terri∣ble,

apperyd to me to be cast interchaungeably, nowe hither now

lenger suffre the intolerable heate and flames of fier, they leaped
to the mydst of that hatefull and deadly colde. And when they
pitefully in could finde no reast there, agayne they wer reuersed
into those vnquencheable flames of fier. As an infinite number
of miserable and wretched soules were tormented without cea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inge
or intermission (as I might then see) with this alteration
and interchaunge of paynes, I beganne to thynck with my selfe,
peraduenture this may be hell of whose intolerable torments I
haue heard men oftentimes talke. But to this cogitation and
thought of myne, my guyde answeryd sayeng. Na thinke not
so for this is not hell as thowe doest suppose. But when he
brought me farder beinge altogether amased with that terrible
sight, I sawe the places rownde aboute vs sodaynly leese
their lyght and euery corner full of darknes. As we entred
in to them, within a litle space they were so thycke that
I could see nothing, but the bright shewe and cote of him
which did conducte me. When we went forward all alone in
this darknesse beholde sodaynly there appeared before vs, ma∣ny
rounde flawes of fier ascending as it were oute of a greate
pitt and falling downe againe into the same: When I was
brought thither my conductour and guide vanished away, and
left me alone in the midest of that darknesse, and horrible
sight. But as those flawes of fyer flew vppe into the element
still without intermission, and fell downe into the deape do∣ungell
againe, I sawe the topp of euery flawe that ascended
full of mens soules, which in maner of litle sparcles of fyer fly∣ing
vppe with the smoke were somtimes a hye, and when the
heate and vapors of the fier were gone, fell downe againe into
the pitte. Moreouer a foule and noysom sauour, breaking out
with the same vapours infected all the darke places rownde
<PB REF="182"/>
about. And as I tarried there somewhat longe in greate horrour
and feare, not knowing what I should do nor whether I shuld
go, nor what should be come of me, in the ende, I heard so∣dainly
behinde my backe most lamentable and pitifull crying,
and withall a lowde skournefull lawghing, as it had bene of so∣me
rude and barbarous people, insulting ouer their enemyes
brought in captiuitie and thrauldome. As sone as the noyse wa∣xing
more brimmer and brimmer came fully to my eares, I de∣scried
a multitude of wicked sprites, which did hale, teare, and
plucke, the myserable and wretched soules of men, in to the
midst of darknes, weaping, wayling, and lamenting their state:
the wicked sprits in the meane skornefully laughing and triū∣phing
at their myserie: amongest whome, as well as I could di∣scerne,
there was a moncke, a lay man, and a woman. The wic∣ked
sprites drawing and haling them, went downe into that
deape fyery flaminge dongell. And it came to passe, that when
they were gone a greate way of, I could neither discerne the
lamentable crye of those soules: neither the skornefull laughter
off the deuills, but had alwaies in my care a confuse noyse. In
the meane season came vp from the fiery flaming dongell, cer∣taine
euill fauoured blacke sprites and compassed me rounde
aboute, and with there fiery eyes, and foule stinking sauours
which they breathed out had almost strangled me: Besides they
threatned to take me with the fiery forkes in their handes: yet
they could in no wise touche me, although they aduentred to
fraye me. When I was compassed in euery side with such foule
finnes, and ougly darknesse I cast my eies now this way nowe
that way if happely there might come any assistaunce or help
to saue me: and behold there appered behinde me, (euen the
very same way I came) the glimsing of a starre, shining in the
midst of that darkenesse, which waxing brighter and brighter
and coming a pace to me, dispersed those wicked sprites away,
which with their fyery pronges were ready to rent me in pe∣ces.
<PB N="163" REF="182"/>
He that came and put them to flight was the guide which
conducted me before: Who turning streytwayes vppon the
right hande, lead me as it were somewhat northward where
the sonne riseth in the winter, and with a trice brought me out
of darknesse into the faire brode light. And as he lead me in the
faire shining light, I sawe before vs a greate walle, which was so
longe and so hye, that on nether side I could see any ende. I be∣ganne
to maruell and muse with my self, why we should go to
the walle, specially whē I saw nor gate, nor loope hole, nor any
other entrance vp to it: but when we were come thither I can
not tell by what meanes, we mounted quickly to the toppe, and
beholde there was a faire brode fielde, both comfortable and
pleasaunt so ful of swete fragrāt sauours, and of fresh florisshing
floures, that incontinent the swete smel droue away quite and
cleane all the stinking and lothsom sent of that darke firy for∣nace,
which had almost stifled me. So goodly and clere a light
shined there in euery place that it semed more fayrer, than the
brightnesse of the day and beames of the some, when it is at
the highest. There were in that field innumerable companies
of white couloured men, many seates, and infinite multitudes
of soules reioysing and triumphing. As he lead me through
the middest of those blessed soules, I beganne to thinke with
selfe, perchaunce this may be heauen, of the which I haue hear∣de
men oftentimes preache. To this my imagination and
thought, he answered saying, this is not the kingdom of heauen
as thou doest imagine. As we went forward and passed the re∣sting
places of those blessed and happie soules, I sawe a more
brighter shining light before vs than the other was, and heard
a sweete melodious noyse of Musicians, besides that such a
swete perfume and fragrāt sauour brake out in euery place, that
the other which I smelled before, and thought excessiuely pas∣sing,
was in comparison vnpleasaunte and nothing worthe, in
leeke manner as the other bright shininge light of the pleasant
<PB REF="183"/>
grene fielde in comparison of this semed somewhat darke and
obscure. In to the which paradise of pleasure as I hoped well
we should go, sodainly my conductour and guide stoode
still, and turning backe brought me agayne the same waye
we came. In our returne, when we came to the mansions
and resting places of those blessed soules, he asked me, this
question. Do you knowe what all this is that yowe haue seene?
I answered no: Then he saied vnto me. The vally which you
saw horrible with hotte flaming fyer, and sharp byting colde is
the place, where their soules remaineth to be examined and tri¦ed,
which differring the cōfession of their synnes, and amend∣ment
of life had recourse to penaunce in the instant and
pointe of deathe, and so departed owte of this wolrde.
Yet bicause they made humble confession of their synnes and
repented euen at the houre of their deathe, they shall come to
the kingdome of heauen at the day of iudgement, and some
before. For the good prayers, charitable almes, and de∣uoute
fastinge of those that yett lyuethe, and especially
the holy sacrifice of the masse, helpe to delyuer many
out of those torments, before that terrible daye. Moreo∣uer
the the fiery flaminge pitt, and stinkinge doungell, which
thowe didst see is hell mouthe, into the which whosoeuer fal∣leth,
he shall neuer be delyuered thence. The goodly grene
field full of odoriferous flowers, where thowe sawest all ioy∣full,
iocund, and mery, is the very same place where their sou∣les
ar receiued which departe oute of this lyfe in the state of
grace, but yet not of such perfection, that they deserue to be
brought streytwaies in to the kingdome of heauen, but for all
that in the day of iudgement, shall haue the sight and fruition
of Christes deity and immortall ioye with his chosen and ele∣cted.
Only they which are perfecte in all their wordes,
thoughts, and dedes, ar caried strayt to heauen after they haue
passed their transitory life. The place where thow heardest the
<PB N="164" REF="183"/>
sweete melodious singing, with the goodly flagrante sauours
and bright shyning light, is next adioyninge to this. Concer∣ninge
thy owne state, because thou shall haue thy naturall bo∣dy,

wilt diligently examin thy doinges vppon earthe, and directe
thy maner of lyuing in vprightnesse and simplicitie, and re∣fraine
thy tounge from vaine and ydell talke, certainly assure
thy self to haue a resting place amongest these blessed soules
which thou seest here: for when I went awaye for a tyme and
left the alone, it was for no other cause but to lerne and en∣quire,
what should be come of the. When he had talked with
me in this sorte, I vtterly detested this present life and was so∣rye
to returne to my naturall body againe. I was so rauished
with the swete fragrant sauoures, and beutifull sights of that
place which I did see, and especiall their society which for the
time made their abode there. Notwithstandinge I durst not be
so bold, as to demaunde or aske any question of my conduc∣tour
or guide, but in the midest of these meditatiōs, I perceued
(by what meanes I can not tell) that I was in the world again,
and liued as other mē did. These sightes and many other thin∣ges
ells, this vertuous and holy man wold not report to sleuth∣full
sluggards and idell folkes, men that had no regard of their
owne life, but to such only, as either dismayed with feare of
torments or rauished with hope of eternall ioye, wolde glad∣ly
receiue and sucke oute of his woordes, some heauenly com∣forte
and encrease of piety. Wel, to be shorte, in the same rewe
where is celle stoode, dwelled a monke called <HI>Hengils</HI> promo∣ted
to the holy ordre of priesthod, which he honoured much
with his vertuous woorkes. This man remaineth yet a lyue,
and leeke a solitary heremitein <HI>Ireland,</HI> fedeth his old impo∣tent

and cōtinue ther singing of psalmes and other duout prayers,

this gentyll admonition, and fryndly exhorta∣tion
of his souerayne contemned and set naught by those com∣fortable
wordes of saluation, and promised that he wolde do

vexed with the vehement pangs of his dysease. The kinge
came to his chamber (for he louyd hym tenderly) and exhor∣ted
and counseled him, that at the lest nowe he wolde falle to
penaunce for his naughty lyfe, and sinfull actes, before he died.
Na quoth he. I wyll not be confessed now, but when I am well
recoueryd and able to go abrode agayne, than I wyll, lest if I

stowtly and leeke a man, but certes, as yt appeared after he was
myserably deceuyd with the crafty illusions of the deuyll.
Whē the kynge came to visite hym agayne, and geue him good

euery daye, he cryed oute incontynent with a pytyfull and la∣mentable
voyce saying. Alas what meane yow my liege, why
come you hither? Yowe are nether able to profitt, nor plea∣sure

Ah, say not so: see ye play the wyse mans parte: Nay sayth he, I
am not madde, but I haue here vndoutedly before my eies a
wicked conscience all woundyd and mangled. And what is this
said the kinge? Yf yt please yower hyghnesse quoth he: a litle
before yower grace came, ij. bewtyfull and hansome yownge

Then sodainly came there abowte me an whole legion of wic∣ked

<P>FVrthermore I my self knew a religious man (whom wold
God I had neuer knowen) placed in a good and famous
monasterie, notwithstanding he him selfe was infamous
for his lewde behauiour and loose lyfe. I could tell his name
also, if it were worth the telling. This man was earnestly rebu∣ked
of his bretherne and other head officers of the monastery,
for his enormities, and exhorted to a better trade of lyfe, but
all was in vaine. Notwithstanding, albeit he would not geue
eare nor humbly obey their charitable exhortations, yet they
did tolerate him very longe for his externalll seruice, which
was very necessarie for them. For he was a singular good car∣penter.
This man was much geuen to dronknesse and other
wanton pleasures of dissolutnesse, and accustomed rather to fit
in his shopp both day and night, than to come to the church to
singe or pray, or heare the trew worde of life with his brether∣ne,

cast in flaminge fier, hard by him: and next to them (oh,

of eternall perdition prepared for me. His bretherne hearing
these wofull wordes exhorted him earnestly to repent and be
sorie for his sinnes, while he was yet alyue. Then he brought to
extreme desperation answered, No No. There is no time for me
to amend my former life, especially seing I perceiue my iudge∣ment

chaunged his minde hereuppon, that what so euer he had he∣ard
or sene in the english church, he most gladly preferred it
before the custome and manner of his owne. For he was ver∣tuous,
wise, and very ready in the knowledge of holy scripture.
After his returne therefore into the countrie he-endeuoured
diligently to reduce all the isle <HI>Hu</HI> to the brode beaten pathe
of truethe, which he knew very wel, and had embraced with all
his harte: but he was not able to bringe it to passe. Whereup∣pon
he sayled into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and preaching there and shewing

before the yeare was complete and fully ended. And

came againe, for obseruation of which feaste he should haue
bene forced to much variaunce and discorde by such as wold
not embrace the truthe. This same vertuous man wrote a

lerned at the lectures and expositions of <HI>Archwulf</HI> a bishop in

and when he had wandred ouer all the lande of pro∣messe,

</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The 20. Chap.</HEAD>
<P>THe iiij. yeare of Osredes raigne, king <HI>Coenrede</HI> which
kept the soueraintie in the countrie of Marshes ho∣nourably
for a tyme, did more honourably forsake it,
and all his dominions. For vnder Constantine the Pope he
went to Rome, and receiuing there the tonsure and habitt of a
religious man, at the Apostles toumbes continued in praying,
fasting, and dealing of almes vntill his dying daye. Vnto this
noble prince <HI>Coenrede,</HI> succeded kinge Edilredes son, which E∣dildred
had the gouuernement of the same realme before him.
There went with him also to Rome Sigheres sonn king of the
east Saxons called <HI>Offa,</HI> (whome we mentioned before) a prin∣cely,
and beautefull gentleman, and then in his first flowres
and much desired of his subiectes to remaine and rule among
them. But he moued with leke deuotion and zeale as the other
prince was, forsoke his ladye, his landes, his kinsfolke, and coun¦trie
for Christes sake, and the ghospell: that in this world he
might receiue an hundred folde and in the world to come life
euerlasting with Christ. When he came to the holy places att
Rome, he also was shoren into religion, in the which he passed
the rest of his life, and came to the vision of the blessed Apo∣stles
<PB REF="191"/>
in heauen, as he had longe desired before. The very selfe
same yere that these ij. princes went out of Britannie, a
worthy prelate and notable bishopp, called <HI>VVilfride,</HI> died the
xlv. yeare after he had ben made bisshoppe, in the territory, cal∣led
Wundale. And his body well chested, was caried to the mo∣nastery
of Rhippon wher he had before liued, and with al ho∣nour,
and solemnitie worthy for so noble a bishopp was buried
in Saincte Peters church at Rhyppon:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 3. cap. 52.</NOTE> Of whose life and beha∣hauiour
let vs brieflly make mention what things were done
returning as it were backe againe to that we haue spokē before.</P>
<P>This <HI>Wilfride</HI> being but a childe was of such towardnesse
and good nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lyfe of bishop VVilfrid the Apo∣stle of Sussex.</NOTE> induced with so many goodly qualities, of
such modest and honest behauiour in all pointes, that all the
elders and auncients did with a speciall good loue reuerence
him. After he was xiiij. yere olde, he more estemed a monasti∣call,
and solitarie lyfe, than all secular and wordly wealth. The
which thing when he had communicated with his father (for
his mother was departed to the mercy of God) he gladly con∣descended
to his holly requestes and godly desires, and exhor∣ted
him to persiste in that godly purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy Ilond.</NOTE> which he had enten∣ded.
Hereuppon he came to the isle <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> and there attē∣ding
vpō the monks, he diligētly lerned, and gladly practised, al
pointes of chastity, and godlinesse required in a solitarie and
religious man. And because he had a goodly pregnant witt
he lerned spedely psalmes and certain other bookes of prayers,
being not yet shoren in or professed, but well garnished with
those vertues, which far surmounted the outward profession
to witt of humility and obedience. For the which he was wel
loued and estemed bothe of the elders, and also of his equals.
When he had serued God certaine yeares in that monastery
he perceaued by litle and litle being growen in iudgement (as
a wife younge man that could quickly fore see) the waye of
trewe religion and vertue taught by the Scotts not to be alto∣gether
<PB N="176" REF="191"/>
perfecte. Whereuppon he fully determined to make a
voyage to Rome, only to see what ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and ceremonies were
obserued there, as well of secular priestes as of religious per∣sonnes.
The which determination of his, after notice geuen to
his Bretherne by preuy conference, eche man did well com∣mēd
it, and persuaded him to go forward in his good purpose.
Incontinent coming to Quene <HI>Eamflede</HI> (who knew him wel,
and by whose counsell and cōmendation he was receaued into
that monastery) declared to her hyghnesse that he had an ear∣nest
and feruent desyre to visit the monuments of the holy
Apostles. The Quene much delited with the younge mans
good purpose and zele, sent him to Caunterbury to kinge
<HI>Ercombert</HI> which was her vncles sonne requiring that it might
please his highnesse to send him honorably to Rome: at what
time <HI>Honorius</HI> one of the blessed Pope Gregories schollers, a
man profoundly lerned in holy scripture, was Archebishop
there. When this younge man lackinge nor good courage, nor
lyuely sprite, had tarried there a space, and employed his dili∣gence
to lerne and commit to memory, that which he ouer∣loked,
there repaired thither an other younge gentilman who∣se
name was Bishop, and Christen name Benet, one of the
nobles of Englande, desyrours to go to Rome, of whom I ha∣ue
mentioned before. The kinge committed <HI>VVilfride</HI> to this
younge gentilman and his company, with chardge that he
shuld conduct him safe to Rome. When they came to Lyons
in Fraunce, <HI>VVilfrid</HI> was stayd there by <HI>Dalphine,</HI> bishop of that
city. The gentleman went on his iourney to Rome. The de∣light
and pleasure, which the bishop had in <HI>VVilfrides</HI> wyse tal∣ke,
aminable continaunce, ioly actituity, and graue inuention,
was the occasion why he was staied there. For that cause also
he gaue him, and all his company frendfull intertainement as
long as they continued there: and furder offred him the gouer∣nement
of a greate parte of Fraunce, the mariadge of his
<PB REF="192"/>
brothers daughter, (whiche was yet in the flower of her
virginity,) brefely to adopte him for his heyr, if he wolde make
his abode there. But he rendring lowly and harty thankes for so
great courtesy and gentilnesse, that the bishop vouchsafed to
shew vnto him being but a straunger, answered, that he was
fully determined to an other conuersation and trade of lyffe:
and therfore had forsaken his country, and taken this iourney
to Rome. The which when the bishop heard, he sent him to
Rome, with a guide to conducte him in the waye, and gaue
him mony sufficient to beare his chardges, desyringe that at his
returne he wolde remember to take his house by the waye.
<HI>VVilfride</HI> with in fewe dayes after cominge to Rome, and oc∣cypuing
him selfe in daily contemplation of heauenly thinges,
according to his first determination fel acquainted with a no∣table
holy and lerned man called <HI>Boniface,</HI> who was Archedea∣con,
and one of the Apostolike Popes counsellers. By whose
instruction he lerned orderly the foure bookes of the Gospell,
and the trewe counte of Easter, and many other godly lessons
commodious and profitable to vnderstande the orders and
disciplines of the churche, which he could not attaine vnto in
his owne country. And when he had passed certaine mone∣thes
there, in godly exercise and study, he returned to <HI>Dalfine</HI>
againe in Fraunce, and after he had tarried with him iij. yea∣res,
he toke the inferiour orders of the bishop, and was so en∣tierly
loued of him that the bishoppe fully determined to ma∣ke
him his successour. But by cruel death he was preuented and
<HI>VVilfride</HI> reserued to a bishoprike in his owne natyue country,
England. For Brunechild Quene of Fraunce sent a power, and
commaunded the bishop to be put to death: whom <HI>VVilfride</HI>
his chappellain folowed to the place of execution, desyring to
die with him, albeit the bishop did vtterly forbid him. But
whē the executioners knew, he was a stranger and an English
man borne, they spared him, and wold not put him to death,
<PB N="177" REF="192"/>
with the bishop. Wereuppon returning to England he was
brought to be in frendship and amity with kinge Aldfride.
Who leke a good Prince had lerned to folow and reuerence
the general ordinaunces and rules of the catholike church.
And for that he perceaued this <HI>VVilfride</HI> to be Catholique, he
gaue him streytwayes a Lordshippe, of x. tenements in Stan∣ford:
and within a while after a monastery with xxx. tene∣ments
in Rhippon: which he had geuē but late to build an Ab∣bay
forsuch as folowed the Scottes: but because they being put
to liberty and choise, had rather departe thence then to receiue
the trewe and Catholique celebration of the feast of Easter,
and other canonicall rites and ceremonies after the custome
of the church of Rome, and see Apostolike, he gaue it to him,
whome he sawe better qualified both for lerninge and for ver∣tue.
The same time in the very selfe same monastery he was
made priest by <HI>Agilbert</HI> bishop of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The countre about Salisbury</NOTE> <HI>Geuisse</HI> (of whom we spake
before) at the instaunce of the Kinge, moste earnestly requi∣ringe
that so lerned a man shuld cōtinually follow his Courte,
and especially be his teacher and preacher. Whome not longe
after when the Scottes secte was disclosed (as is a fore said) and
vtterly abandoned, he sent to Fraunce by the counsell and ad∣uise
of his father <HI>Oswin,</HI> when he was but xxx. yeres of age to be
consecrated and made bishop by <HI>Agilbert</HI> then bishop of <HI>Paris.</HI>
With whom xj. other bishopps assemblinge them selfes to con∣secrate
hym, did their dewty in that behalfe very honorably
with all solemnities. But while he was yet beyonde the seas,
<HI>Ceadda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 3. cap. 28.</NOTE> a godly and vertuous man (as it is aboue mentioned)
was consecrated byshop of yorke, at the commaundement of
King <HI>Oswin.</HI> Who hauing gouerned the churche iij. yeares de∣parted
thence, and toke the cure and charge of Lesting Abbay.
After him <HI>VVilfrid</HI> toke vphōim the bishoprick of al Northū∣berland.
Who afterwarde in the raigne of Kinge <HI>Ecgfride,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. cap. 12.</NOTE> was
depriued of his bisshopricke, and others consecrated and put in
<PB REF="193"/>
his place, of whome we made mention before. But when he
had taken shipp to go to Rome, and pleade his cause before the
Apostolike pope he was dryuen by a Sowthweast winde into
<HI>Freslande,</HI> where he was honorably receaued as well of the rude
and barbarous people, as of the Kinge <HI>Aldgiste.</HI> Where he pre∣ached
also vnto them Christ and his ghospell, conuerting ma∣ny
thousandes to the faith, and with baptisme wasshing away
their sinnes. Whereby he layed the fundation of Chri∣stes
ghospell in those countries, which the Reuerend father
and holy byshopp <HI>VVilbrord</HI> perfited and finyshed afterward.
But when he had passed ouer a winter with this people newly
conuerted to Christe, he went forwarde his iourny to Rome.
When his cause was debated to and fro, in the presence of Pope
<HI>Agatho,</HI> and many other bishopps, he was founde in processe by
all their iudgementes to haue bene most vniustly accused, and
best worthy of that bishopprick. At what time the same <HI>Aga∣tho</HI>
gathering a Synode at Rome of a 125. byshopps against such
heretikes as held the opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The he∣resie of the mo∣nothelites condem∣ned.</NOTE> that there was but one will and
one operation in our Sauiour Christe, commaunded <HI>VVilfride</HI>
also to repaire thither. And when he came he willed him to
declare his faith and the faith of the countrie from whence he
came, sittinge amongest the other bishops: Wherin when he
and his country was founde to be Catholique, it pleased them
amongest other things to haue this also put in the Actes of the
decrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The See Aposto∣lique.</NOTE> the tenour wherof foloweth. <HI>VVilfride</HI> the vertuous
bishop of yorke, and appealinge to the see Apostolique for his
cause, and by that full authoritie absolued as well from certaine
complaints laied to his chardge, as all other vncertaine quarels,
and sitting in iudgement in the felowship of a 125. bishopps in
this present Synod, hath confessed, for al the north partes of the
isles of Englande and Irelande, whiche ar inhabited with En∣glishe
men, Britons, Scottes, and Pictes, the trewe and catholike
faith, and confirmed the same with his subscription. After his
<PB N="178" REF="193"/>
returne to Britanny againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishopp VVilfride the Apo∣stle of Sussex.</NOTE> he conuerted the South saxons frō
idolatrye and superstition to Christes trewe faith and religion.
In the isle of Wight also he apointed certain to preach the word
of God: and the seconde yere of kinge <HI>Aldfrides</HI> raigne, who
had the soueraintye next after <HI>Ecgfride,</HI> receaued his see and bi∣shoprick
againe, at the instaunt request of the kinge. But fyue
yeres after he was accused of the same king, and many other bi∣shopps,
and depriued againe of his bishopricke. Wherein vpon
repairing againe to Rome, and obtaining lycence to pleade in
his owne defence before his accusers, Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> and many o∣ther
byshopps sittinge in iudgment, it was by their diffynitiue
sentence concluded, that in some parte his accusers hadd falsly
forged these malycious surmises against him. The Pope also
wrote letters to the kinges of England <HI>Edilrede</HI> and <HI>Alfride</HI> re∣quiringe
them to see him restored to his bishopricke againe, be∣cause
he was vniustly condemned. The reading of the decrees
concluded in the fore said Synod assembled by Pope <HI>Agatho</HI> of
blessed memory, kept but of late when he hym selfe was pre∣sent
in the cytie and resident amongest other bishops, did much
furder his cause. For when the Actes of the Synode, as occasion
was moued, were openly read ij. or iij. dayes before the nobyli∣tie
and greate assembles of people, by the popes commaunde∣ment,
the protonotarie coming to that place where it was writ∣ten,
Wilfride the vertuous bishopp of yorke appealing to the
see Apostolique for his cause, and by that ful authoritie absol∣ued
as well from certaine thinges layed to his chardges, as all o∣ther
vncertaine quarells &amp;c. As we sayed before, these wordes
being read euery man was astonned and the protonotary cea∣sing,
eche man inquired off other, what manner of man thys
bysshopp <HI>VVilfride</HI> was. Then <HI>Bonyface</HI> a counseller to the
Pope, and many other whiche sawe hym there in Pope <HI>Aga∣tho</HI>
his tyme, made answere and sayd. He is the bishop which
was accused of his owne cuntry men, and came to Rome to be
<PB REF="194"/>
iudged by the see Apostolik, euen the very same which of late
coming hither for the false accusations of his aduersaries, was
iudged giltlesse and innocent by<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pope <HI>Agatho,</HI> after the cau∣se
and controuersie was well examined of bothe parties, and
thought to haue ben depriued of his bishopricke against all la∣we,
and more than that hadd in such honour and estimation
of Pope Agatho of blessed memory, that he cōmaunded him to
sitt in the Synode which he assembled at Rome, as a man off a
trew perfect faith and syncere minde. All these allegations be∣ing
heard, the Pope and all that were present sayed, that a man
of such authoritie which had bene bisshoppe xl. yeares, ought
not to be condemned, but once agayne dischardged and quit∣ted
from the false accusations and malicious surmises of his
enemies, and sent home againe with honour to his countrie.
With this iudgement returning towardes England, he fell so∣dainly
sicke, when he came to Fraunce, and was so weakened,
the desease growing vppon him more and more, that he could
not ryde, nor kepe his horse, but was caried in a bed by strength
of his seruauntes. Being thus brought to <HI>Meldune</HI> a citye in
Fraunce, he lay iiij, dayes and iiij. nights as though he had byn
dead. Only declaring by a litle breath, which he drewe very fa∣yntly
and short, that he was a lyue. Thus continuing iiij. dayes
without meate and drinke, as speachelesse, and past hearing, he
rose the fifte daye, and sate vppe in his bed, as a man awaked
out of a deape sleepe, and when his eyes were open, he sawe a
company of his brethern aboute him, some singing, some wea∣ping,
and fetting a litle sigthe, asked for his chaplyn <HI>Acca.</HI> By
and by he was called. Who entring into the chambre, and seing
his bishoppe somewhat better amended, and able to speake, he
fell downe vpon his knees, and gaue thankes to God with all
the company that was present. And when they had sate toge∣ther
a litle while, and entred talke fearefully, of the high iudge∣ments
of God, the bishop commaunded al to auoide the cham∣bre
<PB N="179" REF="194"/>
for an houre, and beganne to talke after this manner to his
chaplin <HI>Acca.</HI> There appeared vnto me euen now a terrible
vision, the which I wil haue thee heare, and concele withal vn∣till
I know knowe furder the pleasure of almighty God, what
shal become of me. A certaine man clothed all in white, stode
by me, saying. I am <HI>Michael</HI> the Archangell sent hither for this
only purpose, to deliuer thee from daunger of death. For our
Lord hathe geuen the longer tyme to lyue for the earnest pra∣yers,
and lamentations, which thy scholars and bretherne here
haue made, and also for the intercession of the blessed virgin
Marie his mother: Wherefore I say vnto the, that presently thou
shalt be healed of this infirmitie and sickenesse, but yet be in a
readynesse: for after iiij. yeares I will returne againe and visit
the. Agayne, as sone as thou art returned to thy countrye,
the greatest part of thy possessions, that haue ben taken away
from the, thou shalt receiue againe, and ende thy life in tran∣quillitie
and peace. Vppon which comfortable wordes the bis∣shoppe
recouered to the greate ioye of all men, reioysing and
praysing God for him. Thus going forward on his iourney he
came to England. When the letters brought from the see Apo∣stolique
were reade, <HI>Berechtwald</HI> archebisshop and <HI>Edilrede</HI> so∣metimes
kinge (but then made an Abbot) receiued him gladly
in fauour againe. <HI>Edilred</HI> also entreating <HI>Coenrede</HI> whom he
had made kinge in his place, to come and speake with him, re∣quested
him to be a good and gratious Lord to the saied bis∣shopp,
which also he obtained. But <HI>Aldfride</HI> king of Northum∣berland
which would not receiue him, died within a while af∣ter.
By which occasion it fel out in the raigne of kinge <HI>Osred</HI>
his sonne, that in a Synode assembled by the riuer <HI>Nid</HI> after
greate contention and reasoning in both partes, he was recei∣ued
into his church and bisshopprike againe with all fauour

the one and fourtith yeare, after he was directed from Pope
<HI>Vitalian</HI> and made coadiutor to <HI>Theodore,</HI> and the 39. after he
came to Englande: Of whose profounde knowledge and ler∣ninge
amongest other thinges, this may be a sufficient testi∣mony
that <HI>Albine</HI> his schollar, who had the gouernaunce of
the Abbay after his decesse, was so well practised in exercise of

the histories of their martyrdome and other ecclesiasti∣cal

he zelously prepared holy vessels, lightes, and other neces∣saries
appertaining to the better furniture and adorninge of the

of the See Apostolique we haue our selues ben informed and
taught. Of whiche your zeale we thanke highly allmighty
God, knowing well that when princes and Lordes of the earth
<PB REF="197"/>
do employ their study to lerne, to teache, and to obserue the
truth, it is a singular benefit and speciall gift of God geuen vn∣to
his Churche. And most truly spake a heathen philosopher
saying, that the worlde should then be happy, when either kin∣ges
embraced philosoply, or els philosophers might beare the
Soueraynte. Now if by the philosophy of this world, know∣leadg
of the worlde might be hadd, where by the worlde might
be beloued, how much the more ought such as are cityzens of
the heauenly countre aboue, and but straungers in this worlde,
desire, labour, and with all meanes possible be suppliantes to
God, that the higher power and charge they beare in this world,
the more they applie them selues to harken after and vnder∣stande
the will and pleasure of that highe Iudge, which iudgeth
all, and bothe them selues obey gladly the same, and moue also
all other committed vnto their charge, by their example and
authoryte to fulfill and perfourme the same? To come there∣fore
to the matter, wherein you require to be instructed, you
shall vnderstande, we haue in holy scripture iij rules sett forthe
vnto vs, by the which the true and iust time of solemnising the
feast of Easter is appointed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A proufe out of ho¦ly Scrip∣ture, of the Ca∣tholique obserua∣tion off Easter.</NOTE> which by no authorite of man can
be chaunged. Of the which rules, two were taught by God in
the lawe of Moyses, the third is ioyned in the ghospell by the
effecte off Christes passion, and resurrection. For the lawe off
Moyses commaunded that in the first moneth of the yeare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exodi. 12. a. 2 c. 18.</NOTE> and
in the third weke of that moneth, that is from the fiftenth daye
vntell the one and twentith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This first moneth beginneth in the first moone after the <HI>Aequi∣u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctium.</HI></NOTE> Easter should be kept. And it
was added by the institution of the Apostles out of the gho∣spell,
that in the same third weke, we should tary for the Son∣day,
and in it celebrat our Easter. This triple rule if a man di∣ligently
note and obserue, he shall neuer misse in the cownte
of Easter. But if it be yower pleasure, to haue euery particu∣lar
poynte more pitthely and largely declared, it is written in
<HI>Exodus,</HI> where the people of Israel ar commaunded to kepe the
<PB N="182" REF="197"/>
feast of Easter when they shulde be deliuered owte of Aegipte,
that God said to <HI>Moyses</HI> and <HI>Aaron.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exodi. 12. a. 2.</NOTE> <HI>This moneth shalbe vnto

the</HI> xiiij. <HI>day of the same moneth. And all the whole multitude of Is∣rael
shall offer the same vp in sacrifice at the euening.</HI> By the which
wordes it is euidēt, that in the obseruation of Easter, though the
fourtenth day of the first moneth be mentioned, yet it is not so
mentioned that on that day Easter should be kept, but in the e∣uening
of that daye. That is, that the lambe should be offred,
when the moone is fiften dayes olde, whiche fyftenth daye off
the moone, is the begynning of the third weke of the monthe.
And that it is the selfe same night of the xv. daie of the moone
in which God stroke the Aegiptians, and deliuered the children
of Israel, it appeareth by that he saithe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. c. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Seuen dayes ye shall eate

(he saith after) <HI>I will bring and conducte your hoste oute of the lan∣de
of Aegypte:</HI> First of all then. He called that the first day of <MILESTONE N="17"/>
sweete bred, in the which he would conducte and bringe their
hoste out of Aegipte. But it is manifest that they were not de∣lyuered
oute of Aegipte the xiiij. daye, when the lambe was of∣fred
in the euening which night was properly called the passe∣ouer
but the xv. daye, as it is euidently written in the booke of
numbers where we reade thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nume. 33. a. 3.</NOTE> <HI>VVherefore when the children off

the seuen dayes of swete bred, in the first of the which se∣uen
the children of God were deliuered oute of Aegipte, must
be counted (as I said before,) from the beginning of the thirde
weeke, that is from the xv. of the firste moneth to the xxj. fully
complete and ended. Now that the xiiij. daye is not numbred
amongest these seuen, wher Easter beginneth, that which folo∣weth
in Exodus doth euident declare.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 12. c. 17.</NOTE> Where after it was saied,
<HI>For in the vij. daye I will delyuer thy hoste oute of the lande of Ae∣gipte,</HI>
it was added streytwayes. <HI>And you shall keape holy this da∣ye,

dayes shall no leauen bred be founde in your houses.</HI> Now who
doth not plainly see, that from the xiiij. day to the xxj. be nott
only seuen dayes, but also eight, yf the xiiij. day be reakoned for
one. But if we will counte from the euening of the xiiij. daye
to the euening of the xxi. (as the veritie of holy scripture dili∣gently
searched oute doth declare) we shall well perceiue, that
the xiiij. daye so beginneth the feast of Easter in the euening,
that all the whole weeke hath no more but vii. dayes and vij.
nightes. Wherefore our proposition is proued trew, wherin we
saied that Easter must be kepte in the first moneth of the yere,
and the thirde weeke of that moneth. And that is in dede truly
solemnised in the third weeke, the solennite where of beginneth
in the euening of the xiiij. daye, and is complete and ended in
the euening of the xxj. daye. Now after that Christ our trewe
paschall lambe was offred vpp in sacrifice, and had made the
Sondaie (called amongest the auncient writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is so cal¦led Act. 20. and Ioan. 20.</NOTE> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na vel prima
sabbati,</HI> one of the sabothe, or firste of the sabothe) solemne and
holy to vs for ioye of his resurrection, the tradition of the Apo∣stles
hath so put this Sounday in the feaste of Easter, that they
<PB N="183" REF="198"/>
fully decreed, nether to preuent the time of Easter in the olde
lawe nor to diminishe any on daye, but commaunded accor∣ding
to the precepte geuen in the lawe, that the same first mo∣nethe
of the yeare, the same xiiij. daye, and the same eueninge
should be expected and taried for. In which euening when it
fell vppon the saboth daye, euery man should take a lambe ac∣cording
to their families and householdes, and offer him vpp in
sacrifice at the euening. That is to saye, all christian churches
through out the whole world (which all ioyned together ma∣keth
but one catholike church) should prepare bred and wyne,
for the mysterie of the fleshe and precious bloud of that imma∣culate
lambe, which tooke awaye the synnes of the world, and
when all lessons, prayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The B. Sa¦crament is offred vp to god the father.</NOTE> rites and ceremonies vsed in the so∣lemne
feast of Easter were done, shoulde offer the same to god
the father in hope of their redemption to come. For this is
the selffe same night that the people of Israell were deliuered
oute of Aegypte by the bloude of the lambe. This is the same
night in whiche the people of God were delyuered from aeter∣nall
death, by Christes glorious resurrection. In the morning
folowing, being Sondaye, the solemne feast of Easter should
be celebrated. For that is the day, wherein our Sauiour, opened
the glory of his resurrection, appearing diuers times in that one
day to his disciples, to their vnspeakeable comfort and ioye.
This is the first daye of the swete bread of the which clere
mention is made in the <HI>Leuiticus,</HI> wher we reade thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 23. a. 5.</NOTE> <HI>The xiiij.
daye of the first moneth at euening is our Lordes passeouer and the
xv. day of the same his solēne feast of swete bred. vij. dayes shal ye eate
sweete bred: the firste daye shall be most solemne and holye.</HI> Wherefo∣re
if it were possible that the soundaye might alwaies falle vp∣pon
the xv. daye of the firste moneth, that is to saye vpon the
fifteneth day of the age of the moone, we might celebrate and
keepe the feaste of Easter alwaies at one time with the olde
auncient people of god as we do in one faith, albeit they differ
<PB REF="199"/>
from vs in the kinde of externall sacramentes. But becau∣se
the weeke dayes do not runne equally with the course off
the moone, the tradition of the Apostles preached at <HI>Rome</HI> by
S. Peter, and confirmed at <HI>Alexandria</HI> by the Euangelist Saint
<HI>Marke</HI> his interpreter, hath decreed that when the first mo∣neth
is come, and the eueninge of the xiiij. daye of the same,
the next sounday also should be expected and looked for from
the xv. day to the one and twentyth off the same monethe. For
in which so euer off those it shall be founde, Easter shal be kept
in the same. And that because it appertaineth to the number of
these vij. daies in which the feast of sweete bred is commaun∣ded
to be kept. Wherefore it cometh to passe that our Easter
neuer passeth the thirde weeke of the thirde moneth, nor ouer,
nor vnder: but ether it hath the whole weke, (that is to say. vij.
daies of sweet bred according to the old lawe,) or at the lest so∣me
of them. If of all them it compryseth but one, to witt, the
vij. daie which the holy scripture so highlye commendeth, say∣inge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 23.</NOTE>
<HI>The vij. daye shalbe more solemne and hollye, and no seruil
woo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke shalbe done from morninge to eueninge,</HI> no man can iustly
reproue vs, and say we kepe not the Ester soundaye (which we
toke of the gospel) in the third weke of the first moneth apoin∣ted
by the lawe as we shuld do. Now thē seing the general cause
which the Catholiques alleage for the obseruing of this feast
of Easter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con∣trary opi∣nion is re∣futed.</NOTE> is plainly set before your eyes, the vnreasonable er∣rour
of those which rashly presume to passe or preuēt with out
any force of necessitie the time apointed in the lawe, is mani∣fest
for al men to espye. For they anticipate and preuent the
time appointed in the lawe without any force of necessity,
which thinke that Easter day must be kepte, from the xiiij.
moone of the firste moneth to the xx. of the same. For where∣as
they begynne the eue of that holy feast, from the eueninge
of the xiij. it appereth that they appointe that day in the begin∣ninge
of their Easter wherof they finde no mētion in the law.
<PB N="184" REF="199"/>
And whereas they refuse to kepe the Easter soundaye the xxj.
daye, in it appereth truly that they exclude vtterly from their
solemnity that day which the law cōmaundeth to be obserued
and had in memory with ioy and mirth aboue al other. And so
they end their Easter after a peruerse ordre keping it somtimes
altogether in the seconde weeke, but neuer in the vij. day of the
third weeke. Againe they which thinke they shuld kepe Easter
from the xvj. day of the saide moneth to the xxij. day roue far∣re
wide from the truth, and runne though an other waie, yet as
farre out of the waie, as the other did, falling (as the common
prouerbe sayth) in to the greate gulff, and swalloing sandes of
Charibdis, while they seeke to escape the dangerous straites of
Scilla. For wheras they teach, that we shulde beginne frgm the
rising of the xvj. moone of the first moneth (that is from the
eueninge of the xv day) it is manifest, that they vtterly seclude
from their solemnity, the xiiij. day of the same moneth, which
the law doth principally and before the rest commend: so that
they scarse come to the eueninge at all of the xv. day in the
which the people of God were deliuered out of the bondage
of Aegipt, in the which our sauiour Christ delyuered the
worlde from synne by sheding his precious blud, in the which
he being buried, put vs in comfort and hope of resurrection
and aeternall rest after deathe. And these men by occasion of
their former errour, falling in to an other in punishment of
the first, whereas sometimes they kepe their Easter in the xxii.
day of the saied moneth, they do expressely passe the bondes
of Easter commaunded in the lawe. For in the euening of that
day they beginne their Easter, in which euening they ought
by the lawe cleane to haue ended and finished their Easter.
Againe by this meanes they make that day the first daye of
Easter, which in the lawe is not mentioned at all: to wit, the
first day of the fourth weeke. And both these sortes of men are
deceaued not only in counting the age of the moone, but also
<PB REF="200"/>
in finding out of the first moneth. The debating of which mat∣ter
is more tedious and lōg, then that either it can or may be cō∣prised
in an epistle. Only this I say, that the time being ones cer¦tainly
knowē whē the day is as long, as the night, and the night
as the day, at the spring time of the yere, it may infallibly be foū∣de,
which ought to be the first moneth of the yere after the ac∣cōpt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the moon, and which ought to be the last. In the spring
the day is as longe as the night, and so the night as long as the
day after the opinion of all lerned men in the East, and speci∣ally
of the Aegiptians which beare the price for calculation be∣fore
all other Astronomers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The xxj. daie of marche.</NOTE> the xii. calendes of Aprill, as we
also haue had experience by triall of the dyall. Whatsoeuer
moone therfor is at ful befor the day and night be of one lēght
being xiiii. or xv. dayes olde, that mone pertaineth to the last
moneth the yere befor, and therfor is not meet or conuenient
for the feast of Easter. But that mone which is at full either af∣ter
the day and night be of one and equal lenght, or in the very
pointe of that equalitie, in that doubtlesse (because it is the full
moone of the first moneth) we must vnderstand that the olde
aūcients wer wount to kepe Easter, and that we ought to kepe
ours in leeke manner, when the Sondaie cometh.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gene. 1.</NOTE> That it
shuld be so, this reason semeth somwhat to enforce: In Genesis
it is written that God made ii. great lights the greater to rule
the day, and the lesser ouer the night: or as some other transla∣tion
hath, the greater light was made to begynne the day and
the lesser to beginne the night. Therfore as at the first begin|
ning, the son rising from the full middest of the East made
by that his rising, the equalite of day and night in the begin∣ning
of the yere: and as the moone in the very first day of the
worlde the son going downe, folowed also at the full, rising
in the midst of the East: so euery yere in leeke manner the
first moneth of the moone must be obserued after the sa∣me
rate: so that she be not at the full, before the day and night
<PB N="185" REF="200"/>
be of one length but either on the very same day (as it was at
the first creating of the worlde) or when it is paste. For if the ful
mone go but one day, befor the day and night be of one length,
the former reason proueth manifestly that the same mone must
not be ascribed to the firste moneth of the yere, but rather to
the laste of the yere that is past: and for that consideration not
meete nor conuenient for the solemnisinge of Easter daye. Els
in one yere we should haue ij. Easters. Now if it like yow to
heare also the mysticall reason hereof, this it is. In the firste
moneth of the yere, (which is called <HI>mensis nouorum,</HI> that is,
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The moneth of Aprill.</NOTE> moneth of new springe) we are commaunded to kepe the
feaste of Ester, because our hartes and mindes being renewed
toward the loue of heauenly thinges, we ought to celebrate and
honour the mysteries of Christes resurrection and our redem∣ption.
We are cōmaunded to keepe the third weeke of the same
moneth, first because Christ him self promised vnto vs before
the lawe, and in the time of the lawe, came in the thirde age off
the worlde in the time of grace, and was made our Easter, and
passeouer. Secondarely becawse he risinge from deathe the
third daye after his bitter passion vpon the crosse, woulde haue
that daye to be called the daye of our Lorde,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dies Dominic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and all Chri∣sten
men to kepe the feast of Easter yearly the very same day in
honour of his glorious resurrection. The thirde cawse is, be∣cause
we do then truely keepe this solemne feast, if we ende∣uour
to the vttermost of our power to make our passeouer
(that is to saye ower passage owte of this wordle to God the fa∣ther)
with the triple knot of faith, hope, and charytie. After
theequalite of the daye and night we are commaunded yet to
tary for the full moone of the moneth in which Easter falleth,
to thend that first the sonne may make the day longer then the
night, and afterward the moone also may appeare to the world
in her full light, to signifie vnto vs, that the son of righteous∣nesse,
in whose beames is our saluation, that is to sayour Lorde
<PB REF="201"/>
Iesus Christe by the victory and triumphe which he had in his
resurrection, hath ouercomed the darknesse of deathe, and so a∣scendinge
to heauen hath replenished his churche: (whiche is
ofte signified by the moone) with the inwarde light of his
grace, by sendinge downe the goly ghoste. The which ordre
of ower saluation the prophete beholdinge, said, <HI>Eleuatus est
sol &amp; luna stetit in ordine sno.</HI> The sonne is lyfted vppe, and the
moone stode in her ordre. They therefore which contendeth
that the full moone of the moneth in which Easter should fall
may come before the Son maketh the daye and night of equall
length, as they disagree in the celebration of most high and gre∣ate
misteries from the doctrine of holy scripture, so they seme
well to agree with them, which trust to be saued with owt the
preuenting grace of Christe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He mea∣neth the Pelagians</NOTE> Which in dede presume to teache
that man myght haue had perfecte iustification, though Christ
the trewe lyght had neuer ouercomed the blyndnesse off the
world with his painefull death and glorious resurrection. To
conclude therefore, we about the equinoctiall springe, when
the day and night be of one length, and when the full moone
of the firste moneth orderly folowing the same (that is to saye)
after the xiiij daye of the said moneth is fully expired (the ob∣seruation
of all which tymes is commaunded in the lawe) do
expecte yet in that thirde weeke (accordinge as in the ghospel
we lerne) the next Sonday folowing, and then we keepe the so∣lemne
feaste of Ester: And that to thende we may testyfie by
ower doings, that we cellebrat not this solemnytie with the old
fathers, in remembraunce that the children off Israel had the
harde yoke of bondage shaken from their neckes in Aegipte, but
that we woorshipp with deuoute faith, and perfecte charitie the
redemption of all the world, prefigured in that deliuerance off
gods old people owte of thrauldome, and fully ended in Chri∣stes
resurrection: to thende we may signifie that we reioyse in
the assured hope of ower resurrection, which we beleue shalbe
<PB N="186" REF="201"/>
on the same Sonday also. This accompte of Easter, which we
haue here declared vnto you to be folowed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The in∣uention of the gol∣den num∣ber.</NOTE> is comprised in the
compasse of xix. yeres, which of late, that is to saye in the Apo∣stles
time, beganne to be obserued in the churche, especially at
Rome and Aegipte, as I haue specified before. But by the in∣dustry
of <HI>Eusebius,</HI> who of the blessed Martyr <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amphilus</HI> hathe
his surname, it is more playnly and distinctly set in ordre: So
that, where as before the bishop of Alexandria was wonte eue∣ry
yeare to send abrod to euery particular church the true time
of the Easter that yeare to be obserued, now from hence forth
the course of the full moone being brought in to this order, and
certainly tried out, euery church by itselfe can finde it without
failing. This counte of Easter (so distincted by <HI>Eusebius</HI>)
<HI>Theophilus</HI> bishop of Alexandria made to serue for one hundred
yeres, at the request of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the Emperour. Cyril his suc∣cessour
made it for 95. yeres more, comprising it in v. circles of
the saied compasse of 19. yeares. After whome <HI>Dionisius</HI> the
yownger added as many circles in leeke ordre and style whiche
reached euen to ouer tyme. The which now approching nigh
to the date and terme prefixed, there is nowe adayes, such store
of calculatours, that in our churches through owte all En∣gland
there be many, which can by the olde preceptes of
the Aegiptians, (which they haue lerned and commit∣ted
to memory) extende and drawe forthe the circle and
course of Easter, in to as many yeares, as them listeth, euen
to the numbre of 532. yeares. Which number of yeares
being expired, all that appertaineth to the course of the son,
moone, moneth and weke returneth into the same ordre it
did before. The calculation or directory of which time, we ha∣ue
not at this present sent vnto you, because demaunding on∣ly
to be instructed of the reason and cause of this time of Ea∣ster,
it semeth you are allready informed of the time it selfe.
Hauing now hetherto brefly and compendiously spoken con∣cerning
<PB REF="202"/>
the dew obseruation of Easter, accordinge to yower
highnesse requeste, we exhorte you most humbly to prouide
that your clergy haue the same tonsure which the church doth
receiue and vse as most agreable to the Christian faith: wherof
you required also our letters. We know right wel that the Apo∣stles
were not shauen all after one sorte. Neither now the who∣le
catholique church as it agreeth in one faith, one hope, and
one charite towardes God, so vseth also one and the self same
order of tonsure. Againe that we may consider the time befor
vs, to wit, the time of the holy patriarches, Iob a perfect pat∣terne
of patience, when his tribulation and aduersite beganne,
shore his head. Wherby we learne that in time of prosperity
he was accustomed to lett his heare growe. Yet <HI>Ioseph</HI>
a trewe teacher and practiser of chastity, humility, piety and al
other vertues, is written to haue bene shauen, when he came
out of preson. Wherby it appeareth that in prison for the tyme
of his induraunce he was wounte to remaine with longe heare
nor clipte nor shorne. Lo here two vertuous and godly men
who inwardly in hart and mind wer one, shewed yet in outward
behauiour some diuersite and contrariete. But though we may
boldly saye that the diuersite of ecclesiasticall tonsure hurteth
nothing at all such as haue a pure faith in God, and perfecte
charitie towarde their neighbour, especially seing we reade no
controuersie betwene the catholike writers, touching the dif∣ferēce
and diuersitie of shauing, as ther hathe bene for the cele∣bration
of Easter, yet notwithstanding amongest all kynde off
tonsures which we finde to haue ben vsed or in the church, or
vniuersally amongest all other men, I may well saye, that none
is rather to be folowed and receaued of vs, than the very same,
which he ware on his head, to whom Christ saied after he had
confessed him to be the sonne of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Thou arte Peter, and vp∣pon
this rocke I will builde my churche, and hell gates shall not pre∣uaile

<PB N="187" REF="202"/>
And contrarywise we may well beleue, that none is more
to be abhorred and detested of all faithfull men, than that whi∣che
he had to whom desiring to bye the grace and gifte of the
holye ghoste with monie, saincte Peter saied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Thy mony perishe

therefore we also desiring to be saued by the merites off
the same passion, do beare vppon the toppe of our crowne,
(beinge the highest parte of our bodye) the signe of Christes
passion as Peter dyd. For as euery congregation of faithfull
men which by the death of him that quickeneth and relyueth

by profession of the clergy, do binde them selfes more streytly
with the bridle of continency for Chistes sake, to beare in their
head by clipping, the fourme of a crowne, as our mercifull Sa∣uiour
caried vppon his precious head, at the tyme of his pas∣sion
a crowne of thorne, to the entent he might thereby carie
yea and carie awaye the thornes and briers of our sinnes. To
the end also they may protest vnto the worlde, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en by their
open head, that they are ready and gladde to suffer all moc∣kery,
irrision, and obloquy for his sake. Last of all to testifie,
that they looke for the crowne of aeternall glorie, which God
hath promised to all that loue him, and that for the purcha∣sing
of this, they contemne all wordly shame and wanton we∣althe.
<PB REF="203"/>
But touching that fassion of shauinge which <HI>Symon Ma∣gus</HI>
ennemye of Christes faith vsed, who dothe not euen strey∣te
at the beginning detest and abhorre it with all his magyke?
Which to outwarde sight semeth to haue the leeknesse of a
crowne in the ouermost parte off the head, but when a man
cometh nere and beholdeth the hinder parte, he shall finde that
which semed to be a crowne, to come very short thereof. And
truly such manner as it is voide of Christian considerations,
so for Symons secte it is very conuenient. Who in dede by their
simoniacall hypocrisie seme in this life to certain deceiued per∣sons
worthy the glorye of euerlasting ioye, but in the lyfe whi∣che
foloweth the dissolution of this bodye, ar not only depry∣ued
of all hope of the crowne of glorie, but (which is more) are
condemned to euerlasting tormentes and payne. And here
tuly I would not your highnes shoulde thinke that I pro∣sequute
and debate this matter so largely, as though I iudged
them worthy to be condemned which vse this manner of sha∣uinge,
yff they tender in hart and dede the vnytie of Christes
catholique churche. Nay I boldly protest, and affirme that ma∣ny
of them haue bene vertuous and holy men. Of the which
<HI>Adamannus,</HI> priest and Abbot of the Columbines is one. To
whom amongest all other thinges, when he was sent in emba∣sie,
for his owne countrie to kinge <HI>Alfride,</HI> and as he passed was
desyrous to see our monasterie, and shewed in his behauiour
and talke, much wisdome, humilitye, and godlynesse, I saied
these wordes vnto him. I beseke you good brother. Why do
you, beleuing that you shall passe hence to a crowne of lyfe
that hath no ende, weare in your head the proportiō and four∣me
of a crowne, which hath an ende, seming in behauiour to
be contrary to your faith? And if you seke the felowshipp off S.
Peter, why do you follow that manner of shauing, which he v∣sed
whom S. Peter did ex communicate and deliuer to the de∣uil,
and do not rather shewe that you loue entierly with al your
<PB N="188" REF="203"/>
harte his habite, with whom you desire to lyue in eternall blys∣se?
Knowe you for a suerty my derely beloued brother (quoth
he) that albeit I vse the same fasshion of shauing which Symon
Magus did after the custome and manner of my country, yet I
vtterly detest and abandone the vnfaithfulnesse and infidelyty
of Symō Magus and desire with al my hart to follow the step∣pes
of the most blessed head of the Apostles <HI>S. Peter</HI> so farre for∣the
as my poore habilitie wil serue. To that I replyed and saied.
I beleue it is so in very dede. Yet it may be a more manifest de∣claratiō,
that you embrace euen frō the bottom of your hart al
that the holy Apostle Peter taught, if you kepe that outwardly
which you knew was vsed of him generally. For I thinke your
wisdō do easely iudge it most conuenient vtterly to seclude frō
your presence and face (dedicated to God) the habit, proportiō,
and figure of his coūtinaunce, whō you abhorte with all harte,
and minde. And contrariwise as you desyre to folow his steps
and counsell, whome you looke to haue as a patrone before
God the father, so it besemeth you to follow his outward beha∣uiour.
This for that time I spoke to <HI>Adamanus.</HI> Who after well
declared how much he had profited by seinge the ordinaunces
and rules of our churche. For after his returne to Scotland he
reduced by his preaching many of the same cuntry, to the ca∣tholique
obseruation of Easter. Albeit he coulde not reduce
the monkes that liued in the Iland Hij (where he was Abbat)
thereto as yet. He thought also to redresse the māner of eccle∣siasticall
tonsure amongst them, if his authority could haue
preuailed. And I nowe also (most puissant prince) do exhorte
you to endeuour with all the country, where the kinge of kin∣ges,
and lorde of lordes, hathe geuen you the souerainte, to
obserue and kepe all that agreeth with the vnity of Christes
catholike and Apostolike church. So it will come to passe, that
after you haue had dominion and rule here vpon earth, the pri¦mat
and head of the blessed Apostles will gladly open to you
<PB REF="204"/>
and yowers the gates of heauen to rest with the holy angells,
and other dere frēdes of God. The grace of God, of our Euer∣lasting
kinge and lord preserue you (most derely beloued son∣ne
in Christe) and graunte you longe prosperous raigne to
our quietnesse and peace. When this epistle was reade in the
presence of kinge <HI>Naitane,</HI> with many other lerned men besi∣des,
being truly translated into the kinges natiue tounge, by
them which did well vnderstande it, he much reioysed at that
exhortation as some make reporte: euen so much that rising
from the place where he and many of the nobility were sate,
he fell downe vppon his knees, and gaue God thankes, that he
had deserued to receiue such a benefit out of Englande. And
treuly, saied he, I knewe before that this was the trewe celebra∣tion
and kepinge of Easter: but nowe I do so well knowe the
cause and reason, why it shuld be so obserued, that me thinketh
I had no knowledg of it at all before: wherfore I professe and
openly protest before you all, that ar here present, that from
henceforth I and all my people, wil kepe the feast of Easter at
the time which is here described. I thinke it good also that all
priests and religious men in my realme ought to receaue this
kinde and manner of shauing, which we haue heard to be very
reasonable. And without any furder delaye by his princely au∣thority
he performed that which he spoke. For forthwith the
accompte of xix. yeres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This ac∣compt is now cal∣led the golden numbre.</NOTE> were sent abrode by a publique edicte,
to be copied oute, lerned, and obserued through out al the pro∣uinces
of the Pictes: the erroneous accomptes of 84. yeres alto∣gether
blotted oute. All priestes and religious men had their
heads shauen rounde after the trew shape a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d figure of a
crowne. And all the whole country being well reformed, was
glad that they were reduced now to the discipline and ordre

as though it were to his patronage and protection.</P>
