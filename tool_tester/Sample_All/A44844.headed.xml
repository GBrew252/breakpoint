<P>A REPLY To a Book set forth By one of the blind Guides of <HI>England,</HI> who is a Priest at Barwick Hall in LANCASHIRE, Who writes his name, <HI>R. Sherlock,</HI> Batcheler of Divinity, but he is proved to be a Diviner and deceiver of the People: Which Book is in answer to some Queres set forth to him by them whom he calls QUAKERS.</P>
<P>And herein are Replies given to his Answers, by those whom the world reproachfully calls QUAKERS: But we do dwell in the power of the living God, which makes all the earth to quake and tremble at his presence, who is terrible to the wic∣ked, and is laying open and discovering the deceipts of all blind Guides, Hirelings and deceivers, and is making his power mani∣fest, and his name known in his people, whom the world calls QUAKERS.</P>
<P>Dreadfull, powerfull God! Praises to thee for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI> Thy Servant, <HI>Richard Hubberthorne.</HI></P>
<Q><P>O England! thy Prophets have se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en vain and foolish things for thee, and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity, but have seen for thee false burthens and causes of banishment. <BIBL><HI>Lam.</HI> 2.14.</BIBL></P>
<P>And because thou hast hearkened unto them, and not unto me, saith the Lord, therefore woe and misery is coming upon thee and thy Prophets.</P></Q>

<P>REader, This is the word of the Lord to thee, take heed unto the light Christ hath inlightened thee wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall, to guide thy mind into the fear of God, to the light of Christ in thy conscience I speak, which if thou hearken unto it, it will lead thee out of pride, and lus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, aud envie, and will bring condemnation upon that nature thou hast lived and acted in, that is out of the feare of God, and hearkning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o this light in thy conscience, it will di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect thy mind to God, and draw thy min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and affections out of earthly things, and the pollutions of the world, by which thou art defiled; thy mind and conscience is defiled by lust and uncleannesse, lust∣ing after earthly things, and the flesh is defiled by that mind that wallowes in the earth: Now minding this light in thy conscience Christ hath inlightened thee withall, thy understanding will come to be inlightened, to see the deceipts and the blind guides which have led thee from this light in thy conscience which should exercise it, and lead thee to go to fear him, and to be taught of him, and will lead thee from the teachings of man which keeps thee in thy sins, and draw: thee from this light in thy conscience, which convinceth thee of sin, and lets thee see sin and evill, and all ungodlinesse, and will bring thee to deny it, and lead thee to repentance, and so thou wilt come to know Jesus Christ, which gives repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance and remission of sins, and then thou wilt deny Priest <HI>Sherlock,</HI> and all that gene∣ration of Priests, who saith in the <HI>32.</HI> page of his book, that Christ was a person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot capable of faith and repentance. And here I do charge him in the presence of the living God to be a lyer, for he is the author and finisher of faith, and be prea∣ched repentance, and gives repentance to his people: And he denies the knowledg and understanding the Apostles had, and yet saith he preaches the same Gospel, pag. <HI>10.</HI> and sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h that externall Tongues, Arts and Sciences gives them to under∣stand the meaning of the Gospel, pag. <HI>11.</HI> and saith that the spirit causeth fleshly fruits, pag. <HI>22.</HI> and saith, that to understand the doctrine of God, they must use the light of distinctions, pag. <HI>54.</HI> and saith that Religion is the art of arts, pag. <HI>86.</HI> and saith, that prayer in all the parts and species thereof is a means to fetch down the holy spirit of God, pag. <HI>144.</HI> when as the Saints said the spirit taught them to pray, and that they prayed with the spirit and with understanding. Now to the light in your consciences I speak, which will let you see these lying Priests and blind guides, which have deceived you so long, and kept you blind and igno∣rant. So all people cease from them, and wait upon the Lord for teaching.</P>

<HEAD>A reply to a book set forth by the Priest of <HI>Bar∣wick,</HI> who writes <HI>R. Sherlock,</HI> which was an answer to some <HI>Queries</HI> set forth to him, by them whom he calls <HI>Quakers</HI>; who writes himself <HI>Batcheler of Divinity,</HI> and a <HI>Divi∣ner</HI> he is proved.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. WHether your gospel be the same which the Apostles preached, and if it be, why go you to <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> when the Apostle saith, the gospel that he preach∣ed was not after man, neither was he taught it by man?</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> Thy answer is, You preach the same gospel the Apostles preach∣ed, but do not attain the knewledge and understanding of this gospel by the same means:</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Here let all people see what wooden stuffe this is: How can you preach the same gospel, and have not the same knowledge and un∣derstanding? If it be not by the same knowledge and understanding, it is not the same gospel; for the spirit of understanding is but one, and from this spirit of understanding thou hast cleared thy self.</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> And thou sayest, You ought not to depend upon any such imme∣diate revelation from heaven as the Apostles had.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Here again thou h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st cleared thy self from the Spirit that gave forth the scriptures, who denies immediate revelation from heaven; and here thou hast denyed thy self to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Minister of Jesus Christ, for no man knows the Son but the Father, and to whom he is revealed; and thou that denyest immediate Revelation, thou hast denyed the Son of God, and hast shewed that thou hast not life; for he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life: And therefore we deny such schools a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where the rudiments of the world are invented and abundance of filthy words are in the answer to this Querie, which are not worth mentioning.</P>
<P><HI>Que.</HI> 2. Whether you can give another meaning to the scripture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then they are? or whether the Apostles did give the meaning to them when they spoke them forth, yea, or nay? and if they did, what need learned men give a meaning to them!</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> And in thy answer thou sayest, The sense and meaning of the scri∣pture is involved in it.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Here thou wouldest make people believe, Christ were in the letter, who is the substance that gave it forth, and was in them that spoke it forth; for the scripture doth declare another thing of God and Christ, it doth not declare God and Christ is in the letter, but here it is that fools might appear to be blinde, and such as thou sayest, learn∣ed men, must give the meaning to the scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> And thou sayest that Christ took a text, and that <HI>Philip</HI> took a text.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> O thou enemy and slanderer of Christ and the Apostle! Did they take texts to get money with them, and to lye a quarter of a year, or half a year in a text? Christ came to fulfil the scripture, and the A∣postle shewed how Christ fulfilled the scripture, and came to fulfil that, which the prophets spoke: The Scribes and Pharisees were learned men, and they could not open the scriptures; <HI>Peter</HI> an unlearned man, he o∣pened the scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> And thou speakest of standing up in a pulpet of wood.</P>
<P><HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p.</HI> In the time of the Law when they read it, there was a pulpet of wood to a particular people, to whom the Law was given; but Christ said, <HI>Go preach the gospel to every creature:</HI> And Christ cryed woe against them that had the chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st place in the Assemblies: And here thou art one of them that would be under the Law, and would have a pulpet of wood, and pleads for thy learning, that the scribes and Pha∣risees were in, which is to no purpose; who saith the ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nel of the Nut is in the shell: and that comparison thou bringest to make people believe that the life is in the scriptures, and so the poor people is groping in the letter to finde life there, when the life was in them that gave it forth.</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> Thou speakest of flying to God by prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Yet thou denyest revelation from heaven, which the saints was to wait for, the revelation of Jesus from heaven; and this makes all you blinde guides to stumble, because you have not the life which gave
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
forth the scriptures, which now is made manifest to the children of God.</P>
<P><HI>Que.</HI> 3. Shew me by the scriptures who ever was made a Minister of Jesus Christ, that was called of men, Master.</P>
<P>In thy answer to this Querie, thou bringest the Prophets and Priests under the Law called Fathers, to oppose Christs doctrine. Thou wouldest compare <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> to such as the Pro∣phets and Apostles; yet thou denyest immediate revelation from heaven: And here thou hast cleared thy self, and <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> from the life of the Prophets; for they had immediate revelation, and so thou bringest many names, as Pastors, and Shep∣herds, and Ministers, and Apostles, and Evangelists, to oppose Christs doctrine, who saith, <HI>Be not you called of men Master.</HI> So let all see if they be not under the delusion, who saith Master is a civil honour, and so opposeth Christs doctrine. Here thou hast shewed thou dost not believe; for how can you believe, that seek honour one of another? and shewest that thou lovest it, as the Scribes and Pharisees did, &amp; would not part with it, and art in thy pride and vain glory, as the Scribes and Pharisees were, who saith that is a civil honor and respect, which Christ cryed woe against. And here thou hast brought thy self &amp; all thy company under the woe, and <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in the state which Christ pro∣nounced woe against, and thou art judged with the same life that give forth the scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Que.</HI> 4. Shew me by the scriptures, where ever the Ministers of Christ took Tithes of the people, or Augmentations.</P>
<P>In thy answer thou sayest, The Priests under the Law received Tithes. There was a time that they received Tithes, and they might not neglect them, as denying their Tithes to the first Priest∣hood. There was a time after Christ when he was sacrificed up, that he was preached the unchangeable Priesthood, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. then the priesthood which received tithes was denyed, therfore the woe is come upon thee and all thy generation which receive tithes, ac∣cording to the changeable Priesthood. Here thou hast shewed thy self without judgment &amp; the love of God, &amp; the woe is come upon thee &amp; all thy generation which receive Tithes, and hold up the changeable priesthood, and so denyes Christ come in the flesh. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat preached the gospel, which lived on the gospel, denyed the changeable Priesthood which received Tithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but for shame
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
you Ministers of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> stop your mouths, for they must be stopt: do not you sue men at the Law, and imprison men for Tithes? and here you shew you do not preach the gos∣pel, for it will not maintain you; for them that preached the gospel, lived on the gospel; there thou thief art taken, who hath gotten the Apostles words, who art for judgement.</P>
<P><HI>Que.</HI> 5. Shew me by the scriptures, and what scripture have you which speaks of the word Sacrament, which you tell the people of, and deceives the simple.</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> And in thy answer to this Querie, thou art confused: First thou sayest there is no scripture for the word Sacrament; and yet thou sayest Christ commands it, and yet thou sayest there is not such a word in scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Here thou which adds to it, hast brought thy self under the plagues and wo: And here let all who are in the light see if thou art not a deceiver, who deceives thy soul. I charge thee a∣gain that thou knowest not Christ, for thou denyest immediate revelation, so thou knowest not his commands, nor doth not o∣bey them; for none knows the Son, but to whom he is revealed: and here I charge thee to be a deceiver and a deluder of the soul from the Lord. This is in reply to the answer of the fifth Querie.</P>
<P><HI>Que.</HI> 6. Shew me what scripture you have which speaks that the Apostles sprinkled infants.</P>
<P>Thou bringest the scriptures (as Christ saith) <HI>Suffer little chil∣ren to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God</HI>: and this thou bringest to justifie sprinkling infants; for circumcision outwardly, was a type of circumcision inwardly: So thou hast not a word in the scripture to maintain it, but thou ramblest up and down, and perverts many scriptures, in which there is not such a word for it:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 33. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4 11. <HI>John</HI> 5.3. <HI>Jer.</HI> 1.5, 6 <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.66.80.</NOTE> And here I charge thee in the presence of the living God to be a liar; for Christ never commanded sprinkling infants, neither is it any ordinance of Christ, neither is there any example among the holy men of God, that ever it was practised; and the plagues of God is added to thee. Let all people see if there be any word for sprinkling in∣fants, and let the scriptures which thou bringest judge thee, <HI>Luke</HI> 18.15. <HI>Jer.</HI> 15.6. <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.66, 80. <HI>Acts</HI> 10.47. Here I charge thee with all these Scriptures to be a liar, that all these scriptures shal judg thee,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
which thou hast brought for sprinkling of Infants, let the reader of thy booke examine the Scriptures, and find the a liar, and all thy dirty stuffe which thou hast gaithered from them, is to be troden under foot, with the children of the light, who wittnesse Baptisme, and circumsition and new birth borne againe, and all who are here do see thee to be blind, deafe, and a foole, and there thou maiest read thy selfe, let all people see thee here, who art without the life of the Srripture, who deniest immediate revelation from Heaven, which the Apostles wittnessed, and the Prophets, for without God thou art eternally, I witnesse it.</P>
<P><HI>Que.</HI> 7. Shew me what Scripture you have to stand praying in the Sinagogues before Sermon and after, and whether the Apostles did so?</P>
<P>In thy Answer to this querie, thou bringest the Apostles words, (which said <HI>pray allwaies</HI>) to justifie standing praying in the Sina∣gogues, and having the cheifest place in the Assemblies, which Christ cried woe against, and here I charge thee to be a false Pro∣phet, who puts no difference betwixt the Apostle and the Pharesies, though he said, the temple which <HI>Solomon</HI> built him, it was <HI>a hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Prayer,</HI> Christ said there should not be one stone of it left upon another when Christ Jesus was witnessed. <HI>Stephen</HI> for witnessing him was stoned to death; and here thou hast shewed, thou hast no judg∣ment, and errs not knowing the Scripture; and as for Christs whip∣ping them out of the temple, read thy selfe, to the light in thy con∣science I speake, and so all thy praying before thy Sermon and af∣ter, as thou callest it, in the Sinagogues, in the chiefest place of the Assemblies, the woe which Christ pronounced against thy Fathers hath light upon the Son, thou who art found in the same place, let <HI>Math.</HI> 23. judge thee, the life which gave forth these words, the life of these words is upon thee, and so all thy praiers are abomination to the Lord God, in the state thou art in, and the praying of the Saints which was moved by the Spirits, thou hast cleared thy selfe from, for thou deniest immediate revelation from heaven, and how canst thou pray and not with the Spirit? and here let all people judge and see what thy praiers are if thou be not in the st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te of the Pharisees, who deny immedi∣ate revelation, and to be one that is blind, and the praying with the Spirit is wittnessed among the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

the world, and gave the people of the world <HI>Davids</HI> Psalmes to be sung in meeter, the things that you practise, answer them by the Scriptures or the Apostles practise, without consequence or imagi∣nation.</P>
<P>And in thy answer to this querie, thou perverts the Scripture, as in the <HI>Acts,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> sung Psalmes in the prison, with them of the world, they did not go into the world to give them a Psalme to sing, men that were not come to repentance, for saith <HI>David,</HI> the dead cannot praise God, and there I charge thee to be a lier, and puts no difference betwixt the Saints singing with grace and understanding, and the world which hath gotten the forme where thou art, the Apostle did not speake to such as were in thy condition, to be filled with the Spirit, which is not come to repen∣tance, but he spoke to them which were turned from the world, and such sung praises to God, but for such as thee, to go and give to the world <HI>Davids</HI> Psalms in a meeter, and say, <Q>O Lord I am not puft in mind, I have no scornfull eye:</Q> O you profane ones and scornfull ones! how can you sing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s but lie, who have scornefull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes and to sing all your bones quake, and you tremble, and you water your bed with your teares, and you lie roaring all the night and day, when as you scorne <HI>Quakers,</HI> and hate them, and speake all manner of evill of them, how can you speake this but lie?

<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Here I charge thee in the presence of the living God, to be the corrupt tree, for by thy fruit thou art knowne, for <HI>a good tree cannot bring forth evill fruit</HI>; and here thou art proved to be that corrupt tree, which confesses you doe not attaine to the same know∣ledge and understanding the Apostles did, as thou speakest in thy booke, whose harvest is ripe and now is reaping downe.</P>
<P><HI>Pr.</HI> And whereas thou saiest, they shall not overcome the body of sin, whilest in this world.</P>
