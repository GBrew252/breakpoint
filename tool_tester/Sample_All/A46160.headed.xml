<OPENER><SIGNED>ESSEX.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEREAS Our very good Lord <HI>Richard</HI>
Lord Viscount <HI>Ranelagh</HI> and his Partners by
their contract with His Majesty passed un∣der
the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and bearing
date the <HI>24th</HI> day of <HI>August,</HI> in the <HI>23th</HI> year
of His Majesties Reign, did Covenant and
grant to and with His Majesty, His Heirs
and Successors; That they the said <HI>Richard</HI>
Lord Viscount <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and his Partners
would within the space of four years to
commence from the Twenty fifth day of
<HI>December,</HI> which was in the year 1671. ful∣ly
discharge, satisfie and pay, or cause to be fully discharged, satisfi∣ed
and paid all and every the Arrears of pay, which at or upon the
<HI>25th</HI> day of <HI>December</HI> in the year 1670. were behind and unpaid to
any person or persons comprehended in the Martial List according
to the Establishment; And also all Arrears of pay, wages, sallary or
pention then due to any persons comprehended within the civil List
according to the said Establishment, and also all Arrears whatsoever
then due to His Majesties Train of Artillery in this Kingdom, and
would cause due satisfaction &amp; payment to be made thereof within the time
aforesaid, by even and equal portions in good lawful and currant
English money, or so much lawful currant money of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as should
be equivalent in <HI>Ireland</HI> to English money, without any composition,
defalcation, or other deduction whatsoever (the usual fees and cheques
onely excepted) The first payment whereof was to begin at or before
the <HI>24th</HI> day of <HI>December</HI> last past, and that His Majesty, His Heirs
and Successors should be acquitted and discharged thereof, so as such
Arrears of pay then due upon the Military Lists, and to be satisfied
within the time, and according to the proportions aforesaid, do not in the
whole exceed the sum of One hundred thirty nine thousand one pounds,
Eleven shillings and four pence. Deducting the Fees and Cheques,
and so as the Arrears then due on that civil List, do not in the whole
exceed the sum of Four thousand pounds, and so as the Arrears then
due to the Train of Artillery do not in the whole exceed the sum of
One thousand one hundred forty seven pounds.</P>
<P><PB REF="2"/>
And whereas His Majesty having by his said Letters Patents
covenanted, That the said contract should be construed, adjudged,
deemed and taken most favourably and beneficially for the said Lord
<HI>Ranelagh</HI> and his Partners, and for the better enabling them to exe∣cute
and perform their undertaking, and some doubts arising concern∣ing
the said words (by even and equal portions) His Majesty by
His Letters bearing date the <HI>26th</HI> day of <HI>November</HI> last to us directed,
was graciously pleased upon consideration thereof had before the then
Lord Commissioners of His Majesties Treasury in <HI>England,</HI> to order
and declare that the Arrears payable by the said clause, should be dis∣charged,
satisfied and paid by twelve even and equal portions, The
first portion, whereof was to have been paid and satisfied at or be∣fore
the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>December</HI> last past, and so every three Calendar
Months, one more till the whole should be discharged.</P>
<P>And His Majesty did by His said Letters Declare His further
pleasure, That we should give effectual Order for the stateing of
what debts are due from the several Officers and Souldiers con∣cerned
in the said Arrear in their respective Quarters, that so due
care may be taken for the satisfying thereof.</P>
<P>And whereas the said Months pay of the said Arrears, which
was payable on the <HI>24th</HI> day of <HI>December</HI> last, cannot well be paid
until the said Debts be stated and ascertained. We do therefore
hereby publish and declare, That all and every person and persons
claiming any Debt or Debts to be due unto them, from any Officers
or Souldiers of the standing Troops or Companies of His Maje∣sties
Army now in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which have been contracted between the
<HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> in the year 1662, and the <HI>25th</HI> day of <HI>March</HI> in the year
1670. For necessary provisions for themselves or their Horses within
their respective Quarters, shall and may by themselves, or their A∣gents
make proof of their said Debts before the first day of <HI>April</HI> next,
before the Commissioned Officers commanding in chief each Troop,
or Company in their several and respective Quarters, and shall also
cause the said Debts to be certified into the Office of His Majesties
Commissary General of the Musters at <HI>Dublin,</HI> under the hands of
such Commissioned Officers, and also under the hands of the chief
Magistrate of the City or Town where they are now Quartered,
or in case there be no such chief Magistrate, under the hand of some
Justice of Peace in the County where such City or Town is scituated,
before the Twentieth day of <HI>April</HI> next.</P>
<P>And whereas several Troops and Companies have been lately ei∣ther
Disbanded or Transported into <HI>England,</HI> by reason whereof the
persons concerned in such Debts, know not how or where to apply
themselves to the chief Commissioned Officers of such Troops and
Companies; We do hereby further publish and declare, That all and
every person and persons to whom any such Debts are due and ow∣ing
from any Officers or Souldiers of the said Troops or Compa∣nies
so Disbanded or Transported into <HI>England,</HI> do by themselves or
their Agents sometime before the said Twentieth day of <HI>April</HI> next,
make proof of their said Debts before Sir <HI>James Cuff</HI> Knight, <HI>Joseph
Dean, Griffith Bodurda, Abraham Yarner</HI> Esquiers, &amp; <HI>Richard Barry</HI> Gent. or before any two of them at the Office of His Majesties Commis∣sary
General of the Musters at <HI>Dublin.</HI> And we do hereby impower
and requier the chief Commissioned Officer residing with each Troop
or Company now of His Majesties Army in this Kingdom, and al∣so
the aforesaid Sir <HI>James Cuff, Joseph Dean, Griffith Bodurda, Abraham
Yarner,</HI> and <HI>Richard Barry,</HI> or any two of them as aforesaid, to exa∣mine
all such Debts as are claimed from any Officers or Souldiers,
which at any time from the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1662. until the <HI>25th</HI> day of
<HI>December</HI> in the year 1670. were of His Majesties Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
and which have grown due within the time aforesaid, for necessary
provisions for themselves or their Horses in their respective Quarters,
and to give Certificates thereof unto the person or persons unto whom
the said Debts shall appear to be due, and to return Duplicates
thereof into the Office of the said Commissary General of the Mu∣sters
in <HI>Dublin,</HI> on or before the said Twentieth day of <HI>April</HI> next ensu∣ing,
To the end that effectual course may be taken for the satisfa∣ction
of the said Debts, in such manner, and at such times, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as the said Arrears due to the said Officers and
<PB REF="3"/>
Souldiers shall become due and payable, and to be satisfied as a∣foresaid.</P>
<P>And whereas we are informed, That although His Majesty hath
taken care that the said Twelve months Arrear shall be satisfied,
and the said Lord Viscount <HI>Ranelagh</HI> and his Partners, are and shall
be ready to pay the same, at the dayes and times above limited, ac∣cording
to their contract without any Composition, Defalcation, or
other Deduction (the usual Fees and Cheques onely excepted.) Yet
some persons taking advantage of the necessities of the Officers and
Souldiers to whom the said Arrears are due, have presumed to com∣pound
with some of them for the same, at small and inconsiderable
Rates, thereby designing to make unreasonable advantages to them∣selves;
we do hereby declare, That no such Compositions made with
any such Officers or Souldiers for their said Arrears shall be al∣lowed
of, but care shall be taken, that the persons who have made
any such Compositions with any such Officers or Souldiers shall be
satisfied their money, if any they have really paid, thereupon out of
the first monies of the said Arrears, that shall be due and payable
to such Officers and Souldiers, after the Debts due from them in
their respective Quarters shall be satisfied. And we do hereby stri∣ctly
charge and Command all Officers and Souldiers to whom the
said Arrears are due, That they do forbear hereafter making any
such Compositions for their said Arrears, but that they do patiently
expect their satisfaction thereof, at such times as His Majesty hath
appointed for the same.</P>
