<HEAD>THE Six Distinguishing Characters OF A Parliament-Man.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Good People of England,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Disuse, or Distrust of Parliaments in the Four last Reigns, was the Nation's gene∣ral Grievance; and 'twas but lately that parliaments were consulted in the Matters of <HI>Highest Importance</HI> to the Kingdoms.</P>
<P>This was the Destruction of that Mu∣tual Confidence between King and Peo∣ple, which is so Essential to the Prospe∣rity of a Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>Parliaments were call'd together, a long Speech, and great Pretences for Mo∣ney open'd the Session; and as soon as the End was answer'd, they were sent Home about their Business.</P>
<P>If they began to show their Resent∣ments, and appear Sensible of their being Impos'd upon, if they began to search into the Intriegues of the Court, if they began to Question <HI>Favourites,</HI> and <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI> they were equally certain of being dismiss'd.</P>
<P>Now to show us what kind of a Nati∣on we are (that according to the Old Character of an <HI>Englishman</HI>) can never tell when we are Well, Providence has chang'd the Scene.</P>
<P>Former Kings have been Addressed by their Parliament to make War against the <HI>French,</HI> and Money given by Milli∣ons to carry it on, and have had their Money spent, and no War cou'd be had.</P>
<P>Now we have a King that has Fought our Battels in Person, and willingly run thro' all the hazards of a bloody War, and has been oblig'd to use all the
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Perswasions possible to bring us to Sup∣port him in it.</P>
<P>Former Kings wou'd stand still, and see the French over-run <HI>Flanders,</HI> and ru∣in our Protestant Neighbours, tho' the Parliament &amp; People have intreated them to Assist them, and save <HI>Flanders</HI> from the falling into the hands of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Now we have a King, who Solicites the People to enable him to preserve <HI>Flanders</HI> from falling into the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> and to stand by and assist our Protestant Neighbours. And we on the Contrary are willing to see the <HI>French</HI> and Popish Powers, unite and possess <HI>Flanders,</HI> and every thing else, and glad the <HI>Dutch</HI> are in danger to be ruin'd; nay, so willing we are to have the States Ge∣neral destroy'd, that <HI>Damn the Dutch,</HI> is become a Proverb among us.</P>
<P>Formerly we had Kings who raised Armies in Times of Peace, and maintain'd them on sham Pretences of a War never design'd, and received Aids from the Par∣liament Three times for the Disbanding One Army, and having spent the Mo∣ney, left the Parliament to do it them∣selves.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>Now we have a King who against his Judgment, and, as it now appears, against the Nation's Interest, consented to Dis∣band the Army at the first Word from his parliament, tho' he left all the most powerful of our Neighbours with their Forces in full Pay,</P>
<P>Formerly we had Kings who did what they pleas'd, now we have a King who lets us do what we please.</P>
<P>And yet <HI>Englishmen</HI> are not contented, but, as it were with our Saviour, when our Kings come Eating and Drinking, they Cry, <HI>Behold a Glutton and a Drunkard</HI>; and now they have a King that comes neither Eating or Drinking, they cry out, <HI>He has a D—l.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a vain thing to pretend to open the Eyes of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, but by their own immediate Danger, any Bo∣dy might ha' known in former times what the Issue of a Popish Successor would ha' been, and some wiser than others told the People of it, and were rewarded with the Ax and the Halter for their News.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>But when that Popish Successor came to the Crown, and had reduced the Li∣berties and Religion of the Nation to the last Gasp, then those very People, who cou'd not see their Danger at a di∣stance, took a fright when it was upon them, and what was the Consequence? Nothing <HI>but all the Blood and Treasure of this last War.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Nation seen with the same Eyes as the late Lord <HI>Russel,</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and the <HI>Oxford Parliament,</HI> did see, could they have been convinc'd by Argument that <HI>It was inconsistent with the Constitution of this Protestant Kingdom to be govern'd by a Popish Prince.</HI> Cou'd the B—ps, who threw out that Bill, have known that a Popish King wou'd erect a High Ecclesiastick Commission Court, and send them to the <HI>Tower</HI> for refusing him a Power to Dis∣pence with the Laws, this War had been prevented, and the Blood of 300000 <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Protestants, who have perished in it, had been sav'd, all the Ships our Mer∣chants have lost to the <HI>French,</HI> had been safe, and the many Millions of Money, which have been spent, had been in our
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Pockets; all this is owing to the blind∣ness of that Age, who cou'd not see the danger of the Nation, till it was just upon them.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, this is to give you Notice, that the Nation is in more dan∣ger at this time from abroad, than ever it was then in at home.</P>
<P>The King in his Proclamation for the calling a Parliament, has done two things which no King his Predecessor ever did in our Age.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He has told us that he has such a Confidence in his People, that he is very desirous to meet them, and have their Advice in Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He tells us, that what he will advise with them about are Matters of the Highest Importance to the King∣dom.</P>
<P>Matters of the Highest Importance to a Kingdom must relate to some of these things, Peace and War, the Safety of Re∣ligion, Liberty and Trade; at least it will be allow'd that these are Matters of the Highest Importance to the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now, tho' I shall not adventure to ex∣plain His Majesty's Meaning, yet I may
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
be allow'd to build the following Dis∣course on the Supposition of this Expli∣cation:</P>
<P>And venture to suppose His Majesty had said, that the Danger the Protestant Religion seems to be in from the formi∣dable Appearance of the French Power, and the Danger our Trade is in from the Succession of <HI>Spain</HI> devolving to the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and the Danger of a new Flame of War breaking out upon our confedera∣ted Neighbours, whom our Interest, as well as Leagues and Alliances, oblige us to assist; all these things being Matters of the Highest Importance to the Kingdom, he has resolv'd to call a new Parliament, to advise with them about these impor∣tant things.</P>
<P>And because the Circumstances of Af∣fairs are such, as may bring us under a ne∣cessity of Armies, which People are so mightily afraid of; and that the Condition the Breach of our Army has left us in has been such, that if another shou'd be wan∣ting to defend us, 'tis a Question where it cou'd be rais'd.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>Wherefore our proper Defence, may be one of the Important things, for ought we know, about which they are to Ad∣vise.</P>
<P>And because the Debate of an Army is a tender nice Point, I shall explain my self; I do not mean that a Standing Army shou'd have been kept up in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in time of Peace, but, I say, it had been better for <HI>England</HI> and all <HI>Europe</HI> that we had not disarm'd our selves so soon; and if we had disarm'd, that we had not so entirely done it all at once; whereby we rendred our selves so de∣spicable, that the <HI>French</HI> King has had an opportunity to Affront the whole Con∣federacy, in renouncing a League ratify'd and exchang'd, and taking Possession of a Crown for his Grandson, on the new invented Title of a last Will and Testa∣ment.</P>
<P>This he wou'd not have adventur'd to ha' done, had the <HI>English</HI> been in a Ca∣pacity to have possess'd <HI>Flanders,</HI> and to have appear'd at Sea, to have protected the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> in their adherence to the Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7"/>But the <HI>English</HI> having reduc'd them∣selves to such a Condition, that when∣ever the <HI>French,</HI> or any body else please to Quarrel with us, we must be a consi∣derable while before we can be in a po∣sture to act offensively, and the <HI>French</HI> ha∣ving so insulted us in the Affair of <HI>Spain,</HI> that it will stand as an effectual Proof, whether we are in a Capacity to resent an Affront or no; His Majesty, who, when in a much lower Station, did not use to suffer himself to be so treated, has thought fit to advise with the <HI>English</HI> Parliament in the Case.</P>
<P>By advising with the Parliament, I understand, informing them of the State of Affairs, telling them his own Opini∣on, and asking theirs, proposing the Measures he thinks fit to take, and de∣siring their Opinion of the matter, and if they agree with him in the Measures which are to be taken, then to Propose their making provision in a Parliamen∣tary way, for enabling him to Prosecute such Measures as they agree to.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8"/>For to debate and consider Matters of so much Consequence, the King has di∣rected Writs for the calling a new Parlia∣ment, to meet at <HI>Westminster</HI> the Sixth of <HI>February</HI> next.</P>
<P>Since then the Matter is referr'd to the People of <HI>England,</HI> and they are to chuse Representatives for so great a Work, as to advise with a Protestant King a∣bout things of the highest Importance to the Kingdom,</P>
<P>Give a stander-by leave, Gentlemen, to offer something to the People of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> by way of Advice or Direction, in the great Affair they have before them, and if it be with more freedom than is usual, bear with him for once, because 'tis about Matters of the highest Impor∣tance.</P>
<P>The usual Advices given in like Cases, formerly (when the Elections of Mem∣bers were so corrupted, that indeed Ad∣vice was necessary, tho' hopeless) <HI>use to be,</HI> to chuse Men that had Estates, and Men of Honesty, Men that had Interests in the Freehold, and in the Corporations, and that wou'd not give away their Liberties,
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<HI>and the Advice was good</HI>: And had the Coun∣try taken that Advice, the P— wou'd not ha' been huff'd by King <HI>James</HI> into a tacit Permission both of a standing Army at home, and the dispensing the Popish Officers continuing in Commission with∣out taking the Test.</P>
<P>But my Advice must differ from, tho' it must include part, of the forementi∣oned Particulars; and therefore while I am directing these Sheets to the Free∣holders of <HI>England,</HI> I beg them to consider in their Choice of Parliament-men, that there may be Men of Estates, and Men of Honour in the Countries, who by some Circumstances may not be proper to serve in this Parliament, because by Prejudice or private Principles their Judgment may be pre-engaged to the Disadvantage of the Nation's Interest; and since there are such, 'tis necessary, Gentlemen, to cau∣tion you,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That you be well assur'd the Gen∣tlemen you shall chuse are throughly engag'd with the present Circumstances of the Nation, and thoroughly satisfied with the present Establishment of the
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
Government; as Papists are justly exclu∣ded by Law from coming to Parliament, because it cannot be expected that a Ro∣man Catholick can be a proper Person to consult about the Interest of a Protestant Kingdom, so it cannot be rational that he who is a declar'd Friend to King <HI>James</HI> or his Interest, can be a proper Person to advise with King <HI>William</HI> about Matters of the highest Importance to the Kingdom; it cannot be rational, that he who wou'd be willing to have this Nation return to her Obedience to a Popish King, can be a proper Person to be consulted with in Parliament about securing and defending the Protestant Religion; this were to pull down what we intend to build, and wou'd be as proper a way to help us, as a French Army maintain'd in <HI>England,</HI> wou'd be proper to defend us against <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV.</P>
<P>Those Men that Drink Healths to King <HI>James,</HI> and wish him all manner of Prosperity, are they fit Men to repre∣sent a Protestant Nation, and to advise a Protestant Prince for the security of the Protestant Religion?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="9"/>Wherefore, Gentlemen, for God sake, and for your own sakes, take heed, and set a mark on such Men; if you chuse Men disaffected to the Present Settle∣ment of the Nation, Friends to the late King, or to his Interest, you may be cer∣tain, such Men will pull back the Na∣tion's Deliverance, and hinder, not fur∣ther that Unanimity of Councils, which is so much more needful now than ever, can the Friends to a Popish Prince be fit to represent a Protestant People, I have nothing to say to those we call <HI>Ja∣cobites, tho' I wonder any can be such, and yet be Protestants</HI>; but as to their Persons I say nothing to them, no, nor to the Papists, provided they keep the Peace, but to single such out to serve the Nation in a Protestant Parliament, and to advise with King <HI>William</HI> in Matters of the highest Importance, this is a thing so Preposte∣rous, is such a Contradiction, that I know not what to say to it; 'tis like go∣ing to the Devil with a Case of Consci∣ence.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="10"/>Even our Adversaries cannot but laugh at the folly of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, that they shou'd chuse their Enemies to be their Councellors, and think to Establish King <HI>William,</HI> by King <HI>James</HI>'s Friends, nothing can sooner compleat the Ruin of the Kingdom, than to fill the House of Commons with Jacobite Members, who will be sure to forward any thing that tends to division, in order to hinder the Nations Happiness, wherefore tho' I might imagine such Advice to be needless, I must insist upon it, that you will avoid such Men as either have discover'd a Dis∣affection to King <HI>William,</HI> and the Pre∣sent Settlement of the Nation, or that have been upheld by that Party.</P>
<P>In the next place, Gentlemen, let your Eyes be upon Men of Religion; chuse no Atheists, Socinians, Hereticks, Asgillites, and Blasphemers.</P>
<P>Had the Original of the late War been under the Reign of such a Body of Men, <HI>England</HI> might have made a Will, and given her Crown to the Duke <HI>d' Berry,</HI> as <HI>Spain</HI> has to the Duke <HI>d' Anjou,</HI> and have sought Protection from the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="10"/>The danger of Religion calls for Men of Religion to consult about it; you can never expect that Atheists, Socinians, or Asgillites, will have any tenderness upon their Minds for the Protestant Religi∣on; Jacobites will as soon support King <HI>William,</HI> as Atheists will preserve the Protestant Religion; what concern can they have upon their minds for the pro∣testant Religion, who really are of no Religion at all? They'll think it hard to raise any Money for the preservation of Religion, who fancy all Religion to be a trick, and the cheat of the Clergy; they can never think the danger of the Prote∣stant Religion to signifie much, who wou'd not give a Shilling to secure it; and they will never give a Shilling to se∣cure it, who Believe nothing of the mat∣ter; besides this, What goods Laws? What Reformation of Manners? What wholesome Orders for the Morality of Conversation can we expect from Men of no Religion?</P>
<P>Of all things therefore the Members you chuse shou'd be <HI>Men</HI> of Religion, <HI>Men</HI> of Orthodox Principles, and Mo∣ral
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
in Practice, and that more especially now, because the security of Religion not only here, but over the whole World, may lye before them, and have a great dependance upon their Councils.</P>
<P N="3">3. Men of Sence; the House of Com∣mons is not a place for Fools; the great Affairs of the State, the Welfare of the Kingdom, the publick Safety, the Reli∣gion, Liberties, and Trade, the Wealth and Honour of the Nation, are not things to be debated by Green Heads; the saying we have, that the House of Com∣mons is a School for States-men, is an Error, in my Opinion they shou'd be all well Taught, and thoroughly Learn'd in Matters of the highest Moment be∣fore they come there.</P>
<P>There has always been a sort of Gen∣tlemen in the H—se who use to be cal∣led the Dead Weight, who pass their Votes in the House as the poor Ignorant Freeholders in the Country do, just as their Landlord, or the Justice, or the Parson directs; so these Gentlemen un∣derstanding very little of the Matter, give their Vote just as Sir such a one do's,
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
let it be how it will, or just follow such a Party, without judging of the Matter.</P>
<P>Pray Gentlemen, if we are ruin'd, and the Protestant Religion must sink in the World, let us do our best to Save it; don't let us have cause to say, we sent a parcel of Fools about the Business that fell into Heats and Parties, and spent their time to no purpose, for want of knowing better.</P>
<P>Of all Employments a Fool is the most unfit for a Parliament Man, for there is no manner of Business for him; he is capable of saying neither <HI>Ay,</HI> nor <HI>No,</HI> but as he is lead.</P>
<P>I desire to be understood here what I mean by a Fool, not a Natural, an Idiot, a <HI>Ben</HI> in the <HI>Minories,</HI> a Born Fool, no, nor a silly, stupid, downright Blockhead∣ed Fool: But Men are Fools or Wise-Men, comparatively considered with re∣spect to their several Capacities, and their several Employments; as he may be a Fool of a Parson who is a very Ingenious Artificer; a Fool of a Clockmaker, and yet be a very good Sailor; so a Gentleman may be a good Horse-racer, a good Sports-man,
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
a good Swords-man, and yet be a Fool of a Parliament-man, therefore so I am to be Understood.</P>
<P>That he who is Capable to serve his Country as a Representive in Parliament, ought to be a Man of Sence, that is, a Man of a general Knowledge, and recep∣tive of the general Notions of things, acquainted with the true Interest of his Native Country, and the general State of it, as to Trade, Liberties, Laws, and common Circumstances, and especially of that part of it for which he serves; he ought to know how to deliver his Mind with freedom and boldness, and pertinent to the Case; and he ought to be able to distinguish between the Dif∣ferent Circumstances of things, to know when their Liberties are encroach∣ed upon, and to Defend them, and to know how to value a Prince who is faithful to the Liberty and Interest of his Country, and to distinguish such a one from those who have made it their Business to Oppress and Invade the Li∣berties and Properties of the People, and
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
betray them and their Interest to Popish and Bloody Enemies.</P>
<P N="4">4. Men of Years; tho' 'tis confess'd Wis∣dom makes a young Man old, yet the House of Commons is not a House for Boys; we have seen too many young Men in the House, and rash Councils are gene∣rally the Effect of young Heads. Fools and Boys wou'd do less Harm in the House, and grow wiser by being there, were they but allow'd to sit, and not give their Votes; but while a Boy may do as much mis∣chief as a Man, and a Fool as a Man of Sence, 'tis hard the material Points of the Nation's Happiness shou'd be committed either to young or weak Heads.</P>
<P>The Grandeur of the present French Monarchy is not unjustly ascrib'd to the extraordinary Men, who are of the King's Council. The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> is the Great Council of the Nation, and on their Resolutions depends the prosperity both of King and People. Now if these Coun∣cils are committed to young Heads, the Proceedings will be suitable; as he that sends a Fool with a Message must expect a foolish Answer; so he that sends a Boy
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
to Market, expects to make a Child's Bargain.</P>
<P N="5">5. Men of Honesty. It was formerly said, Chuse Men of Estates; the reason was, that they might not be tempted by places and Pensions from the Court, to sell the Nation's Liberties; and indeed the Caution was good; but, Gentlemen, the Case is alter'd, the Court and the Nation's Interest are now all of a side, which they were not then, nor indeed never were since Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The King desires we shou'd do nothing but what is for the Security and prosperity of Religion, and the Glory of the Nation; the Caution a∣bout Estates can do no harm, but a Man's Estate does not qualifie him at all to judge of the Necessity of Giving.</P>
<P>The Article of Estate was only sup∣pos'd to make a Man cautious what he gave, because he was to pay the more of it himself. Now let a Man have but Sence to know when there is a Necessity to give, and that Sence back'd with Hone∣sty, if he has not one Groat Estate, he will be as cautious of giving away the Nation's Money, as he would be of his
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
own: To desire Men should have Estates, that their Interest shou'd make them shy, and backward to give Money, supposes at the same time they shou'd want both Sence and Honesty. <HI>Sence,</HI> that they cou'd not value the Nation's Money, unless they were to pay part of it themselves; and <HI>Honesty,</HI> that they wou'd not take as much care of giving away the Nation's Money as their own. Wherefore do but chuse Men of Honesty, and I do not lay so great a stress upon a Man's Estate. If there was any Body to bribe them, something might be said, but that Trade is over, (God be thank'd) King <HI>William</HI> has no need for it, and King <HI>James</HI> cann't afford it, and so that Fear ceases.</P>
<P>The last Character I shall recommend for your choice is, let them be Men of Morals.</P>
<P>Rakes and Beaus are no more fit to sit in the House of Commons, than Fools and Knaves. 'Tis hard we should put the Work of Reformation into the Hands of such, whose own Conversation is vici∣ous and scandalous. A drunken Parson is a very improper Agent to reform a Pa∣rish,
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
a lewd swearing Justice is not like∣ly to reform the Country, no more is a vitious immoral Parliament likely to re∣form a Nation. Reformation of Man∣ners is an Article of the highest Impor∣tance to the Kingdom; the King has re∣commended it to every Parliament, and yet we find it very much retarded; it goes on so heavily, that the Proceedings are hardly visible; and till you have a reform'd parliament, you cannot expect a Parliament of Reformers.</P>
<P>Unless our Members are Men of Mo∣rals, we must expect very few Laws a∣gainst Immorality; and if there shou'd such clean things come out of an un∣clean, it wou'd be all Hetrodox, and Un∣natural; twou'd be like a monstrous Birth, the Parent wou'd be afraid of it, and it wou'd be asham'd of its Parent.</P>
<P>Besides, how can ye expect that God shou'd accept of the Offering dedicated by Impure Hands? The Work can never be suppos'd to Prosper while the Under∣takers plead for God, and at the same time Sacrifice to the Devil.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="14"/>'Tis true, that God oftentimes Works by unlikely Instruments, but 'tis not of∣ten that he Works by contraries; <HI>Jehu</HI> was made use of to bring to pass the Ruin God had foretold to the Family of <HI>Ahab,</HI> but 'twas a <HI>Josiah</HI> and a <HI>Jehosaphat,</HI> for whom God reserv'd the Work of Re∣formation, and the Destruction of Ido∣latry.</P>
<P>But allow that God may make use of improper Methods, and unlikely Instru∣ments when he pleases to bring to pass what his Providence has design'd, yet we are not to confine him to show his Power, and oblige him to make use of such In∣struments, as he can have no Pleasure in, least he shou'd think fit to refuse his Blessing, and make the Work abortive, or at least delay his Concurrence to the Work of our Reformation, till we shall think fit to chuse such Persons for the carry∣ing it on, as are fit to be employed in so great a Work.</P>
