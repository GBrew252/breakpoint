Alij enim per, <HI>Hoc,</HI> Christi corpus denotari volunt;

<HI>Adoratione,</HI> superstructa portentosa Dogmata omnia
corruere &amp; labefactari necesse est. De singulis, si pla∣cet,
pauca delibemus.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
Primo in loco <HI>Transsubstantiationis</HI> non Dogma
modò, sed &amp; vox ipsa (contra quàm pisces) novitate
sua foetet. Ecquid habent, quod opponant? nonnihil,
nempè, <HI>Patres</HI> antiqui (inquiunt) de Conversione hujus
Sacramenti verba facientes, <HI>Transformationis, Tran∣sitionis,
Transmutationis, Transelementationis</HI> voca∣bula
frequenter usurpârunt: unde ipsissimam suam
<HI>Transsubstantiationem</HI> dilucidè probari gens Romana
clamitat &amp; vociferatur. Cum tamen Adversarios no∣stros
minimè lateat, eosdem Sanctos Patres pari liberta∣te
sermonis judicij{que} synceritate easdem voces singulas ad
alias conversiones transtulisse, ut (Exempli gratiâ) nunc
<HI>Verbi</HI> praedicati in <HI>Auditorem,</HI> nunc <HI>Corporis</HI> Chri∣sti

carnem.</HI> Vndè sequitur, ut quâ ratione praeclari isti
Disputatores unam duntaxat <HI>Transsubstantiationem</HI>
astruere conantur, eâdem ex ipsa <HI>lege Parium</HI> (ô homi∣nes
miserè fascinatos, alios{que} miserrimè fascinantes!)
quatuor alias teneantur admittere.</P>
<P>In Membro tertio partis Dogmaticae quaestio de <HI>Cor∣porali
praesentia Christi</HI> in Eucharistia agitatur, quae{que}
hùc pertinent omnia ad hoc unum Caput reducuntur;
Quid sit illud, quod, juxta Christi institutionem, jam in∣telligitur
[<HI>Corpus meum?</HI>] Hoc Catholica Ecclesia per
multa Secula, ab Apostolicis us{que} temporibus, nullum aliud
esse credidit, quàm quod à <HI>B. Virgine Natum, Vnum,
Vno in Loco Definitum,</HI> seu circumscriptum,
<HI>Organicum</HI> quoque, &amp; demum <HI>Sensuum</HI> omnium
absolutissimâ integritate juxtà &amp; <HI>Gloriae</HI> perfectione
cumulatissimâ praeditum. At quod Romanenses Car∣bonariis
<PB REF="5"/>
suis Discipulis obtrudunt, Deus bone! quale
Corpus, &amp; quàm minimè illud <HI>MEVM?</HI> Primò (id
enim natura <HI>Transsubstantiationis</HI> necessariò exigit)
<HI>Corpus,</HI> quale Pistores pinsunt, ex pane confectum; mox
<HI>Corpus</HI> (nam{que} hoc discontinuitas locorum per se postu∣lat)
<HI>multiplex,</HI> quale <HI>Geryonis</HI> illud fuisse fingitur:
post, <HI>Corpus,</HI> (quià non definitivè in loco) quale esse
nullum potest, <HI>Infinitum:</HI> dein <HI>Corpus,</HI> (quià totum in
qualibet parte Hostiae) quale quis vix somniare potest,
<HI>Paraphysicum:</HI> insuper <HI>Corpus</HI> (ut ipsi aiunt) omni
<HI>movendi, sentiendi, intelligendíque facultate destitu∣tum,</HI>
id est, coecum, surdum, exanime: <HI>Corpus</HI> deni{que}
nullis non sordibus cuiusvis <HI>sterquilinij,</HI> &amp; locorum, quae
honestè nominari non possunt, inhonestissimorū obnoxium.
Qualia Opinionum portenta, ut omninò <HI>Haeretica,</HI> veteres
Patres semper execrati sunt.</P>
<P>Verùm enim verò diversarum aetatum subrancidas
<HI>Historias,</HI> si numeremus, <HI>Tredecim</HI> proferunt, in quibus
memoria de <HI>verissimae carnis, verissimique sanguinis

<HEAD>An Advertisement</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To all Romish Priests and Jesuites of the English Seminaries,
concerning the Necessitie of this ensuing Treatise; as also of
the Authors Sinceritie, and his Adversaries unconscionable
Dealing in their Allegations of Authors.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Grace, Peace, and Truth in CHRIST JESVS.</OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mong all the Controversies held against
your Romish Religion, none were e∣ver
more hott, to draw Protestants
violently into the fire, than these two;
First, the denying your <HI>Romane Church</HI>
to bee <HI>The Catholike Church, without
which there is no Salvation:</HI> Secondly,
the affirming the Romish <HI>Adoration of the Sacrament of the
Altar</HI> to be <HI>Idolatrous.</HI> Therefore have I especially under∣taken
the discussion of both these Questions, that seeing
(as Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> truly said) <HI>It is not the punishment,
but the Cause which maketh a Martyr;</HI> it might fully ap∣peare
to the world, whether <HI>Protestants</HI> enduring that <HI>fi∣erie
tryall,</HI> for both Causes, were indeed <HI>Heretikes,</HI> or
true <HI>Martyrs:</HI> and consequently whether their <HI>Persecu∣tors</HI>
were just Executioners of persons then condemned,
and not rather damnable <HI>Murtherers</HI> of the faithfull Ser∣vants
of Christ. And I doubt not, but as the first hath ve∣verified
the Title of that Booke, to prove your Doctrine,
of the <HI>Necessitie of Salvation</HI> in your Romish Church, to
be a GRAND IMPOSTVRE: So this second, which
I now (according to my promise) present unto you, will
<PB REF="10"/>
make good, by many Demonstrations, that your Romish
MASSE is a very Masse, or rather a Gulfe of many Su∣perstitious,
Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous Positions and
Practises.</P>
<P>And because the very name of ROMANE CHVRCH is com∣monly
used as (in it selfe) a powerfull enchantment, to stu∣pifie
everie Romish Disciple, and to strike him <HI>deafe and
dumbe</HI> at once, that hee may neither heare nor utter any
thing in Conference, concerning the Masse, or any other
Controversie in Religion; be the Protestants Defence never
so Divine for Trueth, or Ancient for Time, or Vniversall
for Consent, or Necessarie for Beleefe: I therefore held it
requisite, in the first place, to discover the falshood of
the former Article of your <HI>Church,</HI> before I would pub∣lish
the Abominations of the <HI>Masse;</HI> to the end that (for
<HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>latrie</HI> in Scripture is often termed spirituall <HI>Adulterie</HI>)
the <HI>Romish Church,</HI> which playeth the Bawd, in patroni∣zing
<HI>Idolatrie,</HI> being once outted, your <HI>Romish Masse,</HI> as the
Strumpet, might the more easily either bee reformed, or
wholly abandoned.</P>
<P>This may satisfie you for the necessitie of this Tra∣ctate.
The next must bee to set before you your owne de∣lusorie
trickes, in answering, or not answering Bookes
written against you; especially such as have beene obser∣ved
from mine owne experience. One is, to strangle a
Booke in the very birth: So dealt Master <HI>Brerely</HI> long
since, by a Letter writ unto mee, to prevent the publish∣ing
of my Answere against the first Edition of his <HI>Apolo∣gie,</HI>
when hee sent mee a second Edition thereof to be
answered, which both might and ought to have beene
sent a twelve moneth sooner; but was purposely reserved
not to bee delivered, untill the very day after my<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the Protestants Appeale in the beginning.</NOTE> An∣swere
(called <HI>An Appeale</HI>) was published. Of which his
prevention I have therefore complained, as of a most un∣conscionable
Circumvention. Another device you have,
to give out that the Booke (whatsoever,) written against
your Romish Tenents, is in answering, and that an An∣swere
will come out shortly. So dealt Master <HI>Parsons</HI>
<PB REF="10"/>
with mee,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In his Sober Reckoning.</NOTE> Certifying mee and all his credulous Readers
of an Epistle which hee had received from a Scottish Do∣ctor,
censuring my Latine <HI>Apologies</HI> to be both fond and
false; and promising that his Answere to them, Printed
at <HI>Gratz</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> should be published before the Mi∣chaelmas
next following: whereas there have beene a∣bove
twentie Michaelmasses sithence, every one giving
Master <HI>Parsons</HI> his promise the flatt lye. A third Art is
a voluntarie Concealement; And thus Master <HI>Brerely,</HI> who
having had knowledge of the fore-mentioned Booke of
<HI>Appeale,</HI> manifesting his manifold Aberrations and Absur∣surdities
in doctrine, his ignorances and fraudes in the a∣buse
of his Authors; as in other passages throughout that
Booke, so more especially the parts concerning the Ro∣mish
<HI>Masse:</HI> yet since hath written a large Booke, in de∣fence
of the Romish <HI>Liturgie</HI> or <HI>Masse,</HI> urging all the same
Proofes and Authorities of Fathers; but wisely concealing
that they had beene confuted, and his Falshoods discove∣red.
Onely hee and Master <HI>Fisher</HI> singling out of my <HI>Ap∣peale</HI>
an Explanation, which I gave of the Testimonie of
<HI>Gelasius</HI> (in condemning the <HI>Manichees,</HI> concerning their
opinion of not administring the <HI>Eucharist in both kindes</HI>)
did both of them divulge it in their Bookes and reports
also in many parts of this Kingdome, as making for the
justification of their sacrilegious dismembring the holy Sa∣crament,
and for a <HI>foule Contradiction</HI> unto my selfe not∣withstanding
that this their scurrilous insultation (as is
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke 1. cap. 3. Sect. 7.</NOTE> heere proved) serveth for nothing rather than to make
themselves ridiculous. The last, but most base and de∣villish
Gullerie, is a false imputation of Falshoods in the
alleging of Authors, which was the fine sleight of Ma∣ster
<HI>Parsons;</HI> a man as subtile for Invention, as elegant
for Expression, for Observation as dextrous and acute, and
as politike and perswasive for Application, as any of his
time. Hee in an Answere to some Treatises, written against
your Romish blacke Art of <HI>Aequivocation by mentall Reser∣vation,</HI>
and other <HI>Positions</HI> fomenting <HI>Rebellion</HI> (to wit)
in his Bookes of <HI>Mitigation</HI> and <HI>Sober Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>koning,</HI> doeth
<PB REF="11"/>
commonly leave the principall Objections and reasons,
and falleth to his verball skirmishes, concerning false Al∣legations:
and (as turning that Ironicall Counsell into
earnest, <HI>Audacter &amp; fortiter calumniare, &amp;c.</HI>) hee chargeth
mee with no lesse than fiftie Falsifications All which I
spunged out in a Booke entituled an <HI>Encounter,</HI> and re∣torted
all the same Imputations of falshood upon himselfe,
with the interest, discovering above forty more of his owne.
Which may seeme to verifie that Cognizance, which your
owne Brother-hood of Romish Priests in their <HI>Quodli∣bets</HI>
have fastened on his sleeve, calling him <HI>The Quintessence
of Coggerie.</HI></P>
<P>As for mine owne Integritie, I have that which may
justifie mee; for howsoever any one or other Error may
happen, in mis-alleging any one Authour, yet that I
have not erred much; or if at all, yet never against my
Conscience. Heereof I have many Witnesses; One with∣in
mee, a witnesse most Domesticall, yet least partiall,
and as good as <HI>Thousands,</HI> mine owne <HI>Conscience:</HI> a se∣cond
is above mee, GOD, who is <HI>Greater than the Con∣science.</HI>
A third sort of Witnesses are such as stand by
mee, even all they who have beene conversant with mee,
in the Perusall and Examination of Authours Testimo∣nies,
by mee alleged; men of singular Learning and
Iudgement, who can testifie how much they endeared
them-selves unto mee, when any of them happened to
shew mee the least errour in any thing. (Hee that shall
say, <HI>Non possum errare,</HI> must be no man; and hee that
will not say, <HI>Nolo errare,</HI> as hating to erre, can be no
Christian man.) The last Witnesse, for my integritie,
may bee the Bookes of my greatest Adversaries, Master
<HI>Parsons,</HI> and Master <HI>Brerely,</HI> whose many scores of
Falshoods have beene layd so open and published for a∣bove
sixteene yeares past in two Bookes (one called <HI>An
Encounter</HI> against the Foreman, the other an <HI>Appeale</HI> a∣gainst
the Second) yet hath not any one appeared out
of your Romish Seminaries, for the vindicating of them
heerein.</P>
<P><PB REF="11"/>
{fleur-de-lys}Since this Part of this Advertisement thus given,
there have some of your Engineers sought to undermine
the whole Structure of this Treatise, by the odious Im∣putation
of <HI>Falsification;</HI> One was a <HI>L: Baron,</HI> and his
<HI>Suggestor:</HI> Another, a notable <HI>Seducer,</HI> in his Letters to
a noble Peere of this Kingdome: the Third, a Romish∣ly
inspired <HI>Detractor,</HI> who are, in this Second Edition,
defeated by a Countermine of just <HI>Vindications,</HI> against
their False and frivolous <HI>Exceptions.</HI> To say nothing of
a late Hobgoblin his feigned Letter to a Ladie, upbrai∣ding
mee with such Taxations of some Falsities, which
about six and twentie yeares since, were falsly charged
upon mee by Master <HI>Parsons,</HI> as I proved in a Booke of
<HI>Encounter.</HI> By which your Practice is confirmed that
which I have often averred, That none may expect from
you any Satisfactorie Confutation of this, or the like
Treatises, seeing that instead of Shott, you answere only
with Squibs. Goe on in the same Course, to make mee
thereby a true Prophet, and (by my Vindications against
your Calumniations) to occasion greater Advantage to
our Cause, and just Defence thereof.{fleur-de-lys}</P>
<P>By these Advertisements you may now easily conceive
with what confidence I may procede in this Worke,
wherein is displayed and layd open, in the discussing of
these Eight Words of Christ his Institution of the Blessed
Sacrament of the Eucharist, [HEE BLESSED; BRAKE;
GAVE; TO THEM; SAYING; TAKE; EATE;
DRINKE,] your ten Romish Prevarications, and Trans∣gressions.
Afterwards, in the following Bookes, are re∣veiled
the stupendious Paradoxes, Sacrilegiousnesse, and
Idolatrie of your MASSE; together with the notorious
Obstinacies, some few Overtures of Perjuries (out of that
great Summe, which may afterwards be manifested in your
swearing to the other <HI>Articles</HI> of your new <HI>Romane Faith</HI>)
and the manifold Heresies in the Defenders thereof: as also
their indirect and sinister Objecting and Answering of the
Testimonies of ancient Fathers throughout, as if they con∣tended
neither from Conscience, nor for Conscience-sake.</P>
<P><PB REF="12"/>
To Conclude. Whosoever among you hath beene fasci∣nated
(according to your <HI>Colliers Catechisme</HI>) with that one∣ly
Article of an <HI>Implicite Faith,</HI> let him be admonished to
submit to that Duetie prescribed by the Spirit of God, to
<HI>Trie all things,</HI> and to <HI>Hold that which is good.</HI> And if any have
a purpose to Rejoyne, in Confutation either of the Booke
of the Romish <HI>Imposture,</HI> or of this, which is against your
<HI>Masse;</HI> I do adjure him in the name of Christ, whose truth
wee seeke, that avoyding all deceitfull Collusions, hee pro∣cede
materially from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sed surdis canimus.</NOTE> poynt to poynt, and labour such an
Answer, which hee beleeveth hee may answere for before
the Iudgement seat of Christ. Our Lord Iesus preserve us to

Secondly, that this Act of</HI> Breaking of bread is <HI>such
a principall Act, that the whole <HI>Celebration</HI> of this Sacrament
hath had from thence this</HI> Appellation <HI>given to it, by the Apo∣stles,
to be called</HI> Breaking of Bread. <HI>Thirdly, that</HI> the Church
of Christ alwayes observed the same Ceremonie of Breaking the
bread, aswell in the Greeke as in the Latine (<HI>and consequently the</HI>
Romane) Church. <HI>Fourthly, that this</HI> Breaking of the Bread is a
<HI>Symbolicall</HI> Ceremonie, betokening <HI>not only</HI> the Crucifying of
Christs bodie upon the Crosse, <HI>but also (in the common participa∣tion
thereof)</HI> representing the Vnion of the Mysticall body of <MILESTONE N="10"/>
Christ, which is his Church, Communicating together of one loafe:
that as many graines in one loafe, so all faithfull Communicants are
united to one Head Christ, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 10. thus,
[The bread which wee breake, is it not the Communion of the bodie
of Christ? for we being many are one bread.]</P>
<P>Wee adde, as a most speciall Reason, that this <HI>Breaking it,</HI> in
the distribution thereof, is to apply the representation of the <HI>Bo∣die
Crucified,</HI> and the <HI>Bloud shed</HI> to the heart and soule of every
Communicant: That as the <HI>Bread</HI> is given <HI>Broken</HI> to us, so was
<HI>Christ Crucified</HI> for us. Yet, neverthelesse, your Church contra∣rily <MILESTONE N="20"/>
professing, <HI>that although Christ did breake bread, yet</HI> (BE∣HOLD!)
<HI>she doth not so;</HI> what is it else, but to starch her face, and
insolently to confront Christ his Command, by her bold Coun∣termand
(as you now see) in effect saying; <HI>But doe not this.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A SECOND CHALLENGE.</HEAD>
<P>AS for that truly-called <HI>Catholike Church,</HI> you your selves
do grant unto us, that by <HI>Christ</HI> his first <HI>Institution,</HI> by the

of the whole <HI>Church</HI> of Christ, aswell <HI>Greeke</HI> as <HI>Latine,</HI> the <HI>Cere∣mony</HI>
of <HI>Breaking bread was continually observed.</HI> Which may
bee unto us more than a probable Argument, that the now
Church of <HI>Rome</HI> doth falsly usurpe the Title of CATHO∣LIKE,
for the better countenancing and authorizing of her
novell, Customes, although never so repugnant to the will of
Christ and Custome of the truly-called <HI>Catholike Church.</HI>
Howbeit wee would not bee so understood, as to thinke it

<P>In the next place, to your Pretence of <HI>Not-breaking,</HI> because

(namely) that by the Distributing of the <HI>Bread,</HI> and by <HI>Breaking</HI>
it, some little crummes must cleave sometimes unto the beards
of the Communicants, or else fall to the ground. Or as though
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
this Alteration were to be called <HI>Reverence,</HI> and not rather <HI>Ar∣rogance,</HI>

and the Latter more especially by <HI>Bellarmine</HI> himselfe,
in our former Sections, as you have seene.</P>
<P>A second devise of qualifying these words of our Article,
[<HI>Repugnant to the word of God</HI>] is his owne, but thus:<NOTE N="16" PLACE="marg"><HI>Paraph.</HI> De∣crevit igitur Articulus esse Repugnans Scrip∣turis, id est, non Doctrinae Scripturae, sed Scriptioni, seu Traditioni Scriptu∣rae, quae fuit Corin∣thijs in Lingua com∣muni.</NOTE> <HI>The
Article decreeth it to be repugnant to the Scriptures, that is,</HI>
(saith hee) <HI>not to the Doctrine of Scripture, but to the Scrip∣tion,
or tradition of Scripture, which among these Corinthians
was in praying in a common tongue.</HI> Here you have a dainty <MILESTONE N="20"/>
Distinction betweene the word, <HI>Scripture,</HI> and <HI>Scription;</HI> the
word <HI>Scripture</HI> to signifie the Doctrine of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and the
word <HI>Scription,</HI> to betoken Tradition of Scripture. So hee,
by an elegant Figure, which wee forbeare to name, but wish
there were some sense in it. For was it ever heard off, that
there was a <HI>Scripture</HI> without <HI>Scription?</HI> that is to say, a
Writ without writing; or when as all Divines ever distin∣guished
of <HI>Traditions</HI> into <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Written,</HI> which

without the same written word of God; Was it possible for <MILESTONE N="30"/>
them to conceive of a <HI>Tradition in Scripture,</HI> which was not
<HI>Scripture</HI> or word of God? If so, then whereas all Creatures
are distinguished into Sensible and Insensible, it shall be

<P>His third Crotchet.<NOTE N="17" PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem.</HI> Dum. dicit esse Repugnans verbo Dei, intelligi deberent Institutioni D. Pauli, non Chri∣sti, cujus scripta sub nomine verbi Dei comprehenduntur: omnia tamen ab A∣postolis demandata non sunt mandata Christi, ut ab om∣nibus concessum est.</NOTE> <HI>When the Article saith [Repug∣nant
to the word of God] It is to be understood as meaning, Re∣pugnant
to the Institution and Ordinance of Saint Paul, not of
Christ, Saint Pauls writings being comprehended under the
name of Gods word: although all that are commanded by the
Apostles are not therefore the commands of Christ, as all do con∣fesse.</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
So hee. That there are in Scripture <HI>Apostolicall Consti∣tutions,</HI>
namely such as are fitted to the Churches, according
to the Conveniences of the times, distinguished from Di∣vine
Constitutions, which are enjoyned the Church, as ne∣cessary
for all times, it is true. But that (both which this
Paraphrase affirmeth) either S<SUP>t.</SUP> <HI>Paul,</HI> in requiring a <HI>Knowno
Prayer,</HI> delivered not therein the Doctrine of Christ, neces∣sary
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
for all times, or that our English Composers of this
their Article (in affirming the Institution of <HI>Vnknowne
Prayers</HI> to be <HI>Repugnant to the word of God</HI>) did not thereby
understand the word and Commandement of Christ, in his
Authenticall Scripture, are two as strange exorbitancies as
your Glosser could make.</P>
<P>For the Apostle, to shew that hee taught a Doctrine which
concerned all the Churches of Christ, and at all times, useth
Similitudes to Illustrate his meaning, universally fitting all
<MILESTONE N="10"/> ages and Congregations of Christians in their solemne pray∣ers.
<HI>If a Trumpet,</HI> (saith hee) <HI>or a Pipe give an uncertaine
sound, who shall prepare himselfe either to the Battell, or to
the daunce?</HI> applying those Similitudes as well to praying,
as to preaching in an <HI>Vnknowne tongue.</HI> But every one of
you will grant that the <HI>same Scripture,</HI> for necessitie of
<HI>preaching in a knowne tongue,</HI> is the Divine Instituti∣on
of Christ, and not onely an Apostolique Constitution.
Therefore (except you will separate that which Christ,
by his Apostle, hath joyned together) you must confesse
<MILESTONE N="20"/> the same necessitie of the Command of Christ for knowne
Prayer. Besides, his Conclusion [<HI>How shall hee that under∣standeth
not, say Amen?</HI>] being as true of all Prayers, in
all subsequent ages of the World, as it could be to the
Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> it prooveth the truth of the Divine Or∣dinance
of Christ therein. Thus farre of the meaning of
S. <HI>Paul,</HI> now to returne to our Article.</P>
<P>Whereas you, and all that ever read Protestant Bookes
know, that whensoever they affirme any thing to be <HI>Repug∣nant
to the word of God,</HI> they meane to the <HI>Scripture,</HI> as it
<MILESTONE N="30"/> is the expresse Command and Ordinance of God, and of
Christ; and that notwithstanding your Glosser should dare
to tell us that the meaning of our Articling. [<HI>An unknowne
Prayer to be Repugnant to the Word of God</HI>] must signifie,
<HI>not Repugnant to Scripture,</HI> or to the <HI>Institution of Christ,</HI>
but to <HI>Scription and Apostolicall Tradition;</HI> must needs ar∣gue,
in your Professor, some ecclipse of judgement, by the
which also hee venteth out his Inference following.</P>
<P>A fourth straine he hath in his Inference from our English
Article, as followeth.<NOTE N="18" PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem.</HI> Vi hu∣jus verbi probabiliter inferri potest, debere Ecclesiae officia apud nos hodiè celebrari in lingua Latina, qui∣à per se loquendo est lingua communis, &amp; communites intelle∣cta: solùm autem asseritur in Articulo, Preces publicae fiant linguâ à populo in∣tellectâ, quod sine dubio debet intelligi de lingua per se com∣muni, non per Acci∣dens loquendo.</NOTE> <HI>The Article affirmeth</HI> (saith hee)
<MILESTONE N="40"/><HI>that Prayers ought to be used in a tongue knowne to the people,
therefore wee properly inferre, that Prayers in our Church
may be in Latine, because it is a language commonly knowne.</HI>
So hee, speaking of your Romish Latine prayers, not knowne
of your owne people. As if one should argue, saying, Because
the kingdome of England holdeth it necessary that the plea∣ding
of her lawes be used in English, in a tongue knowne and
understood of her Subjects: therefore may it be thence Con∣cluded
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
that the Pleas of other kingdomes may be exercised
in Latine, a common language, although not understood of
the people of any Nation. Who seeth not in his Inference
an extreme want of Logicke?</P>
<Q>A more full Confutation of the Glossers Qualification of the
words of our English Article, viz. [Prayer unknowne
is Repugnant to the words of God;] by his inter∣preting
it, as not meant strictly of the do∣ctrine
of Christ, but of the Tradi∣tion <MILESTONE N="10"/>
of the Apostle himselfe.</Q>
<P>It is most notoriously knowne to you all, that <HI>The same</HI> Ar∣ticle,
against <HI>Vnknowne Prayers,</HI> is common to all the Chur∣ches
of Protestants, in a full Accordance, to condemne the
contrary Profession and practice of the Romane Church,
which justifieth her Custome of praying in a <HI>Language un∣knowne
to the people,</HI> as <HI>not Repugnant</HI> to the Law of God.
And (reciprocally) you are not ignorant that your <HI>Councell</HI>
of <HI>Trent,</HI> in her <HI>Anathema</HI> and Curse, cast upon all that should <MILESTONE N="20"/>
say, <HI>That the Masse ought to be celebrated in the vulgar tongue,</HI>
intended thereby to accuse all Protestants for condemning
the Custome of the Church <HI>of Rome,</HI> as a transgression of the
word and Commandement of God in holy Scripture. Now
this your Paraphrazer, by his Moderation and qualification
indeavouring to reconcile these Two Contradictorie Inten∣tions,
namely, of your Romish in condemning our English
Article, and of our English Article, in condemning your
Romish Canon: What it is but to affirme, that one Church
hath opposed against the other for Causes they know not <MILESTONE N="30"/>
what?</P>
<Q>Of the second part of the English Article.</Q>
<Q>The Article, [Prayer in an unknowne tongue is likewise
Repugnant to the Custome of the Primitive
Church.] The Glosser opposeth
against this.</Q>
<Q>HIS FIRST INSTANCE.<MILESTONE N="40"/></Q>
<P><NOTE N="19" PLACE="marg"><HI>Paraph.</HI> Grae∣ci apud omnes Iuris∣dictioni Patriarchae Constantinopolitani subditos, licèt Grae∣ci non sint, officia Idiomate Graeco ce∣lebrant.</NOTE> <HI>SOme, whose vulgar language is not Greeke, yet being
under the Greeke Patriarch of Constantinople, pray
in the Greeke Idiome.</HI> So hee, for proofe of the lawfulnesse
of the peoples praying in a language unknowne. But the In∣stance
is lame of the right legge; it sheweth indeed, and wee
confesse, that many, whose native language is not Greeke,
pray notwithstanding in the <HI>Greeke Idiome;</HI> but that they un∣derstand
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>
and not these Greeke prayers (which is the onely point
in question) it prooveth no more than <HI>Tenterton-steeple</HI> pro∣veth
<HI>Goodwin-sands.</HI> For we have<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above Sect. 7 thorow-out.</NOTE> manifested the contrary
in a full Section, (namely) that all such People, who, being
not <HI>Greekes,</HI> and prayed in the <HI>Greeke Idiome, did notwithstan∣ding
understand that Greeke language wherein they prayed.</HI>
Was your Paraphrazer in good tune, thinke you, when hee
would not see this his marke, that he might speake to the pur∣pose
and matter in question?</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/> Next, he being destitute of any other Instance in the
Greeke Church, seeketh some other advantage in the Latine
Church, in the dayes of Antiquity, from Saint <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and
S. <HI>Augustine:</HI><NOTE N="20" PLACE="marg"><HI>Paraph.</HI> In Africa, ut testatur Cyprianus in orat. Domin. Et Augusti∣nus de bono perse∣verant. cap. 13. Mis∣sas, &amp; reliqua faci∣ebant Latinè, licèt lingua vulgaris erat Punica, &amp; Latina ab inferiori plebe non intellecta.</NOTE> <HI>They both witnesse</HI> (saith he) <HI>that their people
in Africke said their Masse and other services in Latine, albeit
their owne language was the Punicke, and that the meaner peo∣ple
were ignorant of the Latine tongue.</HI> So hee, joyning his
witnesse together; but wee will take them apart, to avoid
Confusion, for the better confuting of your Paraphraser,
if hee will yet thinke himselfe confuted. <HI>Cyprian</HI> is alleged
<MILESTONE N="20"/> to have said, as is premised, in his Exposition upon the
Lords prayer: where there is not one syllable of mention of
the people of <HI>Africke</HI> saying of Masse, or of their vulgar
<HI>Punicke Language,</HI> or of their <HI>Ignorance of the Latine tongue.</HI>
If this be not foule dealing, to produce a dumbe witnesse,
and to father Sayings upon him, which hee never uttered,
then will you thinke it farre more ougly, if the witnesse,
being heard to speake himselfe, shall avouch the Contrary.
Hearken then unto <HI>Cyprian,</HI> in the same Exposition of the
Lords Prayer, instructing his <HI>Punicks</HI> and <HI>Africans</HI> as follow∣eth.
<MILESTONE N="30"/><NOTE N="21" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cypr. Sect.</HI> 22. <HI>Expos. in Orat. Dom.</HI> Quandò stamus ad orationem, Fratres dilectissimi, vigilare &amp; incumbere ad pre∣ces, toto corde debe∣mus, nè quicquam tunc animus, quàm id solum cogiter quod precatur.</NOTE> <HI>Dearely beloved Brethren, when wee pray, wee ought
to be watchfull, and attend our Prayers with our hearts, lest our
mindes in praying thinke of any other thing, than on that which
is prayed.</HI> So hee. <HI>Ergo,</HI> say Wee, The <HI>Africans,</HI> albeit their
vulgar Idiome was <HI>Punicke,</HI> yet did they understand those
<HI>Latine Prayers,</HI> which you your selves must likewise confesse,
except any of your Priests could accordingly instruct your
rude people, ignorant of the Latine tongue, wherein they
pray, by saying unto them, <HI>Beloved Brethren, We,</HI> (that is, you
and I) <HI>ought to attend to our prayers, and not thinke of any thing
<MILESTONE N="40"/> but that which is prayed.</HI> If any of you should so exhort your
seely people, to attend to that they understand not, might
they not interpret that his Exhortation to be no better than
meere Mockerie; and as plaine an exprobration, as if hee
should entreate a bald man to combe his head, or a blind
man to thred a needle?</P>
<P>Wee adde furthermore, that this <HI>Latine Exposition of the
Lords Prayer</HI> was one of the <HI>Sermons of Saint Cyprian,</HI> and so
<PB N="42" REF="39"/>
stiled in the same place, <HI>Sermo sextus,</HI> his <HI>sixt Sermon,</HI> prea∣ched
promiscuously to all his people of <HI>Africke</HI> then assem∣bled.
Which is a demonstrable Argument that this people of
<HI>Africke</HI> understood the Latine tongue; you your selves pro∣fessing
that <HI>Preaching</HI> ought alwaies to be used in a Language
which the people do understand.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Augustine</HI> is his second Witnesse, but for what?
namely, that <HI>The Africans, albeit their Nationall Language was
the Punick, yet did they pray in the Latine tongue, whereof they
were ignorant.</HI> So he. And Wee answer, that in the place <MILESTONE N="10"/>
alleged (which is his Booke <HI>de Bono perseverantiae, cap.</HI> 13.)
there is no more mention of <HI>Punick tongue,</HI> or <HI>Latine Lan∣guage,</HI>
than there is of <HI>Welsh,</HI> or <HI>Irish.</HI> It may be that <HI>Saint
Augustine</HI> hath something hereof in some other place, and so
indeed he hath: for in a Sermon of his unto the <HI>Africans,</HI> he
speaketh hereof as plainely, as if in direct termes hee had
given this your Paraphraser the word of disgrace.<NOTE N="22" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. de Verbis Apostoli. Serm.</HI> 24. Proverbium notum est Punicum, quod quidem Latinè vobis dicam, quia Punicè non omnes nôstis; Nummum quaerit pestilentia.</NOTE> <HI>There

in the Punick tongue, which I will render unto you in Latine, be∣cause
all of you do not understand Punick: The Proverbe is this,<MILESTONE N="20"/>
The Pestilence seeketh money.</HI> So hee, shewing that the <HI>Afri∣cans</HI>
understood <HI>Latine</HI> better than <HI>Punick,</HI> although this
were their <HI>Nationall Language.</HI> Farre otherwise your Glosser,
that the <HI>Latine was unknowne to the Africans, because their
native language was Panick.</HI> Whereby hee bewrayeth a
(Proverbially so called) <HI>Punick Faith.</HI> Flatly contradicting
<HI>S. Augustine,</HI><NOTE N="23" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Confess. cap.</HI> 14. La∣tina didici inter etiam blandimenta Nurricum.</NOTE> who furthermore confesseth of himselfe,
saying, <HI>I learnt the Latine tongue from the fawning and flatte∣ring
Speeches of my Nourses.</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<Q>Our Conclusion, by way of Censure of this mans Exposition of the
Articles of the Church of England, and of the Romish
Authorizers of the same Treatise.</Q>
<P>This one Point being the first of his Paraphrase, that fell
in our way, concerning any doctrine appertaining to the <HI>Ro∣mish
Masse,</HI> wee have beene the more Copious in Confuta∣tion
thereof, that our Reader might take a just scantling of
the judgement of this <HI>Paraphrazer</HI> in the rest; and of those
who were the <HI>Censurers,</HI> Approvers, and Authorizers of the <MILESTONE N="40"/>
same: more principally <HI>Thomas Blacklous,</HI><NOTE N="24" PLACE="marg"><HI>Censura Tho∣mae Blacklouse de Li∣bellis de Articulis Con∣fessionis Angl.</HI>—Ca∣tholico animo con∣scriptis, ut Errantes ad Christi caulam re∣ditum inveniant.</NOTE> who shewes to
what end this Tractate was writ, and approoved (as he saith)
<HI>To bring those that wander out of the way unto the fold of Christ,</HI>
Meaning, the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> So then wee perceive it was
not (as he seemeth to pretend) in the behalfe of Protestants,
to free them from any of the former Censures and <HI>Anathe∣ma's,</HI>
or from the curses and cruelties of the <HI>Romish Church</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="39"/>
against them; but onely to ensnare them, if it may be, in the
same <HI>Babylonish</HI> thraldome of <HI>Superstition</HI> and <HI>Idolatry,</HI> from
whence by the marvailous and gracious providence of God
they have beene delivered.</P>
<P>Therefore, from these our Premises, VVee Conclude
<HI>Blacklous</HI> and his fellow Privilegers of this Booke, to be
guilty of all the above-manifested strange dealings, in per∣verting
of the senses of the Articles and Authors by him
alleged. Besides that, which surmounteth the rest, is the hai∣nous
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Crime of wilfull Perjurie, if they have taken the oath
enjoyeth unto all Romish Priests by <HI>Pope Pius,</HI> after <HI>the
Councell of Trent,</HI> swearing <HI>To expound no Text of Scripture,
without the unanimous consent of ancient Fathers:</HI> yet now
have allowed such an Exposition of the text of the Apostle,
concerning <HI>Prayer in an unknowne tongue,</HI> which they were
never able to justifie by any one Father of Primitive times,
for the space of 600, that wee say not a thousand yeares after
Christ, as hath beene sufficiently proved.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/> Before Wee end, Wee should aske your Censurers, what
<HI>Church of Rome</HI> it is, whose doctrine they would reduce Pro∣testants
unto? Is it the old and primitive Religion of <HI>Rome?</HI>
Why this is that which Wee so constantly professe. But
meane they the Religion of the <HI>new</HI> Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in her
<HI>new Creede</HI> of new Articles, conformable to the <HI>Councel of
Trent?</HI> Wee must say then of your Doctrine, as Christ said
of <HI>Wine, No man drinking the Old, desireth the New, for hee
will say, the Old is better.</HI> Luc. 5. 39.</P>

Con∣fessions
of your owne Iesuites will shew: first, that the
Practice of the Apostles and Primitive Church, for above 500
yeares, was according to Christs Institution, to <HI>deliver the
Bread into the hands of the Communicants.</HI> Secondly, that the <MILESTONE N="20"/>
same Order was observed at <HI>Rome</HI> (as appeareth by the <HI>Epistle
of Pope Cornelius.</HI>) Thirdly, that whereas <HI>Some</HI> had devised, for
<HI>Reverence</HI>-sake, certaine <HI>Silver vessels,</HI> by the which they re∣ceived
the Sacrament; yet two <HI>Councels,</HI> the one at <HI>Toledo,</HI> and
the other at <HI>Trullo,</HI> did forbid that fashion, and required that
they should <HI>receive it with their hands.</HI> Hitherto from your

<P>Vaine, therefore, is your pretence of <HI>Reverence,</HI> in suffering
the <HI>Priest onely to receive it with his hands,</HI> as being more wor∣thy

<HI>High-Priest Christ Iesus</HI> disdained not to <HI>deliver</HI> it into the <HI>hands
of his Disciples.</HI> Or else to deny this liberty unto the people, as
if their <HI>Hands</HI> were lesse sanctified than their <HI>mouthes.</HI></P>
<P>But you will say that it is in <HI>Reverence,</HI> lest that the <HI>Body of
Christ may</HI> (as you teach) <HI>light upon the ground, if any fragments
of the Hoast should chance to fall.</HI> There can be no doubt, but
that, in the dispensation of this blessed Sacrament, Christians
ought to use due Cautelousnesse, that it may be done without
miscarriage; yet must you give us leave to retort your pre∣tence
of <HI>Reverence</HI> upon your selves, thus: Seeing that <HI>Christ</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
himselfe <HI>instituted,</HI> and his <HI>Apostles</HI> observed, and that the
whole <HI>Church of Christ</HI> (for so many hundred yeares) thus <HI>pra∣ctised</HI>
the administration of this Sacrament <HI>from hand to hand,</HI>

without respect of such <HI>Reverence,</HI> they therefore were not of

It is an AND Conjunctive, questionlesse. For seeing it cannot
be denyed, that the Apostles Practice was both <HI>Eating</HI> and
<HI>Drinking</HI> conjunctively, it is not likely or credible that the <MILESTONE N="20"/>
sense of his words should be discretive; because this had beene,
in words, to have contradicted his owne practice. Master

else-where, so here also are too confused, by not distinguishing
the divers use of [AND] namely, in Precepts, and Exhorta∣tions <MILESTONE N="30"/>
to an Act, from AND, in denunciation of judgement, in
case of Transgression. As for example, The Precept is, <HI>Honour
thy father, And thy mother, (Exod.</HI> 20.) here [AND] must needs
be copulative, because of the Obligation of Precept of <HI>honou∣ring
Both.</HI> But the denunciation against the Transgressour, if
it stood (as Master<NOTE N="7" PLACE="marg">{fleur-de-lys}<HI>Mr. Brerely in his Lit. Tract.</HI> 4. §. 7. Vsual it is in Scrip∣ture to use the Con∣junctive, ET, <HI>And,</HI> for the Disjunctive.

contrary both to the Originall, and vulgar Latine Translation)
thus, <HI>Hee that shall strike his father, And mother, shall die:</HI> the
particle [AND] must needs be taken disjunctively for, <HI>Or,</HI> (as
indeed it is expressed in the Text) because the Transgression <MILESTONE N="40"/>

<P>THe <HI>Hereticall Manichees</HI> forbare the use of the <HI>Cup</HI> in this

but by some evill spirit;</HI> whom <HI>Pope Gelasius</HI> did therefore con∣demne
by his publike Decree: which Hereticall opinion (as
once I<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Appeal. lib. 2. Chap. 1. pag. 140.</NOTE> said) cannot justly be imputed unto the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI>
in her manner of abstaining from the <HI>Cup</HI> in the Eucharist. This
<PB N="72" REF="54"/>
Saying<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">In his Answer to his Majestie.</NOTE> <HI>Master Fisher</HI> the Iesuite, of late, thought good to
pervert to his owne use, thus. <HI>The Crime wherewith some Pro∣testants
charge us, that our receiving under the sole forme of Bread
is to jump in the opinion of the Manichees, wee may (as</HI> Doctour
Morton <HI>confesseth) reject as injurious, saying with him, that
it was not the Manichees abstinence from w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, but the reason of
their forbearance that was judged Hereticall.</HI> So hee. But this
mans march is but slow.</P>
<P>Master Brerely,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">In his Booke of the Liturgie of the Masse, Tract. 4. §. 4. pag. 407.</NOTE> <HI>a Romish Priest, one well esteemed among

Morton himselfe (<HI>saith he</HI>) shall plead in our behalfe, who saith <MILESTONE N="10"/>
that the Manichees did heretically celebrate the Eucharist onely
in one kind, in an opinion that wine was not created by God, but
by some evill spirit, and were therefore anciently condemned for
Heretiques: but the Romanists are not to bee accused of this here∣sie
of the Manichees, in their not distributing of both elements of
bread and wine. And to object this against that Church were an
accusation injurious, for it was not the Manichees abstinence from <MILESTONE N="20"/>
wine, but their reason thereof which made them hereticall,
said hee. <HI>So your Priest; yet what of all this?</HI> So clearely doth
Doctor Morton (<HI>saith hee</HI>) cleare us from the foule and false im∣putation
urged against us by Doctor Whitaker, who noted the Ad∣ministration
but in one kind, now used by the Romish Church, to
have had it's originall from the Manichees: and so clearely doth
hee contradict both Master Whitaker and himselfe, in one place
accusing us, in another excusing us, in one and the same Respect:
of which foule fault of Contradiction in so great a Rabbin when he
cleareth himselfe, instead of being Bishop of Litchfield, hee shall
bee unto mee ever Magnus Apollo. <HI>Thus farre Master</HI> Brerely.<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Alas! what will become of the</HI> Doctor, <HI>being as you see, thus

<HEAD>CHALLENGE,</HEAD>
<P>IT is now about twenty yeeres since the sayd Doctor (in
Confutation of a booke of Master <HI>Brerelyes,</HI> intituled an <HI>A∣pologie</HI>)<MILESTONE N="40"/>
published a Treatise, called the <HI>Protestants Appeale,</HI>
wherein were discovered many hundred of Master <HI>Brerelyes</HI>
Ignorances, Falsities, and Absurdities: who ever since hath
had Master <HI>Parson's itch,</HI> (as hee himselfe called his owne hu∣mour)
which received a Salve that might have cured him of
that itch, to bee medling with the same <HI>Doctor.</HI> Yet the only
Exception, which hath since come to this <HI>Doctor's</HI> eares from
<PB N="73" REF="54"/>

whereupon you have heard them both so urgently, and
boastingly insist: and not so onely, but they have also divulged
this pretended <HI>Contradiction</HI> in many Counties of this King∣dome,
to his reproach. Will you be so kinde, as but to heare an
Answer, and then either wonder at, or hisse, or applaude, or him,
or them, as you shall <HI>find just Cause.</HI></P>
<P>Two things there were condemnable in the <HI>Manichees,</HI> one
was their Act and Practice, in dismembring the Sacrament, by
<MILESTONE N="10"/> not communicating in Both kinds: the other was their Opi∣nion,
which they held, for so doing; which was, as you have
heard, an <HI>Hereticall</HI> Conceit, that <HI>Wine was the Creature of the
Devill.</HI> Concerning this <HI>Hereticall</HI> opinion, no <HI>Protestant</HI> (sayd
<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Protestants Ap∣peale lib. 2. chap. 4. Sect. 3.</NOTE> Doctor <HI>Morton</HI>) doth charge the <HI>Church of Rome:</HI> but as for
the Act of not <HI>Communicating</HI> in Both kinds,<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">In the same Ap∣peale, lib. 4. chap. 22. Sect. 10.</NOTE> he called it

<P>Seeing then Doctor <HI>Morton,</HI> and all <HI>Protestants, cleare the

the <HI>Manichean Sacrilege,</HI> in respect of the Act of dismem∣bring

your Priest and Iesuite reade that. Answere of Doctor <HI>Mor∣ton,</HI>
to collect from thence, either your <HI>Churches</HI> Iusti∣fication

foule <HI>Contradiction to himselfe,</HI> and that clearely forsooth,
in the <HI>same respect?</HI> who themselves are now found to have
beene so subtilly witlesse, as not to discerne <HI>Heresie</HI> from
<HI>Sacrilege;</HI> an opinion from a fact; or a no-imputation of that,
whereof neither <HI>Doctor Whitaker,</HI> nor any other <HI>Protestant</HI> ever
<MILESTONE N="40"/> accused them, from a practice condemned by a <HI>Roman Pope</HI> him∣selfe.
Take unto you a Similitude. A man being apprehended
in the company of Traytors, upon suspicion of Fellony, is fully
and effectually prosecuted for Fellony onely; if one should say
of him, that he was not convicted or condemned of Treason, but
of Fellony, were this either a Contradiction in the party spea∣king,
or a full Iustification of the party spoken of?</P>

the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> is dissenting from the <HI>Greeke,

and deny this liberty to Others? Is there likewise <HI>Vniformity</HI>

<P><MILESTONE N="10"/> Your fourth Pretence is, because divers are<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Multi sunt ab∣stemi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, qui vinum non ferunt. <HI>Bellar. lib.</HI> 4. <HI>de Eucharist. cap.</HI> 28.</NOTE> <HI>Abstemious,</HI>

<HI>That Wine moderately taken of such can do no hurt,</HI> may not satis∣fie,
yet this being also a Cause accidentall, and extraordinary,
you ought to be regulated by this generall Rule, <HI>That extraor∣dinary
Cases ought not to justle out ordinary Lawes and Customes.</HI>
For, that Command of Christ to his Apostles, <HI>Go preach to every
Creature,</HI> stood good in the generall, albeit many men happe∣ned
<MILESTONE N="20"/> to be deafe. Saint <HI>Peter</HI> requireth of every Christian of
sit yeares, that he be <HI>prepared to give an answer of his faith to eve∣ry
one that asketh;</HI> which precept was not therefore alterable,
because of multitudes of many that were dumbe. Finally, to
close up with you, he that by the rule of Hospitality is to
cheere up his guests, doth not prescribe that, because some mens
stomackes are queasie, and not able to endure Wine, or else
some meates, therefore all others should be kept fasting from
all meates and Drinkes: and the Eucharist (you know) is called
by Saint <HI>Paul, The Supper of the Lord,</HI> and by ancient Fathers, an

<P><HI>The second kind of Romish Pretences is of Such, which might
have beene common to other Churches.</HI></P>
<P>The other Causes above-mentioned were common to the
primitive Church of Christ, wherein the use of Both kindes
was (notwithstanding) preserved and continued; except that
you will say, no <HI>Northerne Nations</HI> were <HI>Christians</HI> in those
<MILESTONE N="40"/> times: and that no <HI>stomackes of Christians</HI> were <HI>dis-affected to
wine,</HI> in loathing it, &amp;c. But two other Pretences you have,
which you thinke to be of more speciall-force, to forbid the
use of this Sacrament in Both kindes; One is <HI>Because</HI> (saith
your<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Primò movet Ecclesiam consuetu∣do recepta, &amp; appro∣bata consensu Gen∣tium &amp; Populorum. <HI>Bellar. quo sup.</HI></NOTE> Cardinall) <HI>such is the now-received and approved Custome
of Nations and People.</HI> So he. But first to argue, that your
Church did therefore forbid the use of both kindes, because
she had approved the contrary Custome, is a meere Nugacitie
<PB N="80" REF="58"/>
and Tautologie; and as much as to say, Shee would forbid it,
because shee would forbid it. Secondly, saying, that the Vse of
but One kinde had indefinitely the <HI>Consent of Nations and Peo∣ple,</HI>
is a flat falsity, because (as hath beene confessed) <HI>The Greeke
Church</HI> (not to mention <HI>AEthiopians, AEgyptians, Armenians,</HI> and
<HI>Others</HI>) have alwayes held the Contrary Custome. Lastly, to
justifie your Churches Innovation, in consenting to the humour
of <HI>People</HI> of latter times, what can you censure it lesse than a
grosse and absurd Indulgence?</P>
<P>The other Motive, which the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Mover Eccle∣clesiam, &amp; quidem vehementer Irreve∣rentia &amp; profanatio∣nes tanti Sacramenti, quae vix evitari pos∣sent in tanta fideli∣um multitudine, si omnibus daretur sub utra{que} specie. <HI>Bellar. ibid.</HI></NOTE> Cardinall calleth a <HI>Vehe∣ment
presumption,</HI> and which all your Objectors most earnestly <MILESTONE N="10"/>
urge, is the Cause of <HI>Irreverence,</HI> lest the blood might be spilt,

<HI>also lest any particle of the Hoast fall to the ground,</HI> saith Master
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Liturg. tract. 4. §. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Brerely.</HI></P>
<P>We have but foure Answers to this mighty Objection. First,
that this was not held a Reason to <HI>Christ,</HI> or his <HI>Apostles,</HI> or to
the <HI>Church of Christ,</HI> for many ages, when notwithstanding the
multitudes of Communicants were innumerable. Secondly,
that <HI>The Casuall spilling of the Cup,</HI> saith your<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Vtriusque speciei usum illicitum esse at{que} sacrilegium ait∣falsum est, quòd usui Calicis annexum sic peccatum vel sacrile∣gium, propter pericu∣lum effusionis: nam si haberet adjunctum peccatum, neque Christus Dominus, neque Apostoli in primitiva Ecclesia, nec Orientales mo∣do, nec Occidentales ante Conc.

would the Apostles, or Primitive Church aswell in the West as in
the East, in their communicating; nor yet the Priest in consecra∣ting,
have used it.</HI> So he. We might adde, by the same reason
should people be forbid the other part also, <HI>lest</HI> (as your Priest
said) <HI>any particle thereof should fall to the ground.</HI> Furthermore,
for the avoiding of <HI>Spilling,</HI> you (as your Cardinall <HI>Alan</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Cernuntur hodiè ex antiquitate relictae quaedam fistulae ar∣genteae &amp; aureae ve∣lut canales, calicibus vetustioribus adjun∣ctae, ut per eas sine effusione hauriri pos∣set sanguis è calice, quarum in Ordinario Rom. sit mentio.

<HEAD>A GENERALL CHALLENGE,
Concerning this last Transgression of Christ his Massè.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> SECT. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN this wee are to make an open discovery of the odious Vn∣charitablenesse,
the intolerable Arrogancie, the vile Perju∣ry,
the extreame Madnesse, and Folly, together with a note of
plaine Blasphemie of your Romish Disputers, in Defence of this
one <HI>Romane Custome</HI> of forbidding the <HI>Cup</HI> to faithfull Commu∣nicants.
For what Vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aritablenesse can be more odious, than
when they cannot but confesse, that there is <HI>more spirituall grace</HI>
in the receiving of the Communion in Both kindes, do notwith∣standing
boast, even in the open Councel of <HI>Trent,</HI> of some of
<MILESTONE N="30"/> their Professors, who, in obedience to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> do
not onely (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the last te∣stimonie above.</NOTE> their owne words) <HI>not desire the Cup of life, but also
dare not so much as desire it.</HI> Which Vaunt, wee thinke, besides
the Impietie thereof, inferreth a note of prophane Tyranny.</P>
<P>Secondly, when wee compare these Fathers of <HI>Trent,</HI> with
the Fathers of most primitive Antiquity, they answer,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Tertio loco ob∣jiciunt Ecclesiae sapi∣entiam, antiquita∣tem, atque potesta∣tem; atque potesta∣tem; aiunt enim, Ec∣clesiam primitivam, quae antiquior &amp; sci∣entiâ at{que} vitae san∣ctitate praestantior erat, utraque specie usam fuisse: nostra igitur illam imitari debet, praesertim eum eandem atque illa habet potestatem in ejusmodi legibus positi∣vis sive abrogandis sive dispensandis. Respondemus, non esse dubium quin Ecclesia primitiva nostrae majore charitate, ac proindè uberiori sapientia praecelluerit, nihilominus tamen interdum contingit minùs sapientem in aliquo maliùs sapere, quâm alium absolute sapientiorem. Saepe etiam accidit, minùs perfectum hominem vitare aliquem errorem, quem melior non vitat. <HI>Salmcron. Ies. Tom.</HI> 9. <HI>Tractat.</HI> 38. §. Tertio loco. <HI>pag.</HI> 320.</NOTE> <HI>Al∣though
the primitive Church</HI> (say they) <HI>did exceed our's in Zeale,
Wisdome, and Charity, neverthelesse, it falleth out sometimes, that
the wiser may in some things be lessè wise than another.</HI> Which an∣swer,
<MILESTONE N="40"/> if wee consider the many Reasons, which you have heard
the Fathers give, for the use of Both kinds, and their consonant
practice thereof, what is it but a vilifying of the authority of all
<PB N="86" REF="61"/>
ancient Fathers? and indeed (as the saying is) <HI>To put upon them
the Foole.</HI> The like answer two of their Iesuites made to the
<HI>Practice of the Apostles,</HI> saying that your <HI>Church,</HI> having the
<HI>same spirit,</HI> hath the <HI>same power to alter the Custome:</HI> whereas we
have proved, that the ground which the <HI>Apostles</HI> lay, for their
Custome, was the <HI>Institution of Christ.</HI> But that which the <HI>Ro∣mane
Church</HI> allegeth, is meerely a Pretence of <HI>Plenitude of</HI>
her owne <HI>Authority;</HI> It is impossible therefore that in so great
a Contradiction there should be the same Spirit. And can there
be a more intollerable Arrogancie than is this, which this <HI>Ro∣mane <MILESTONE N="10"/>
spirit</HI> bewrayeth in both these?</P>
<P>Thirdly, upon the Consideration of this their Contempt of
Apostolicall and primitive Antiquity, in this Cause, wee finde
that your Romish Priests are to be condemned of manifest per∣jurie
also; for in the <HI>Forme of Oath, for the profession of the Ro∣mish
Faith,</HI> every Priest and Ecclesiasticke is sworn<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Forma Iura∣menti, per Bullam Pij quarti. Apostoli∣cas &amp; Ecclesiasticas Traditiones admit∣to,—Ego spon∣deo, &amp; juro, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>To admit
of all Apostolicall and Ecclesiasticall Traditions;</HI> as also to hold
what the<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Caetera omnia à Concilio Tridenti∣no declarata &amp; con∣firmata firmissimè te∣neo. <HI>Ibid.</HI> Romanam Ecclesiam Magistram esse Ecclesiarum cre∣do, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>Councel of Trent hath decreed.</HI> But this Custome
of administration of Both kindes, as hath been acknowledged,
was an <HI>Apostolicall Custome,</HI> and from them also remained in an <MILESTONE N="20"/>
Ecclesiasticall profession and practice thorow-out a thousand
yeares space; which your Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> notwithstanding,
in her <HI>Councel of Trent,</HI> (whereunto likewise you are sworne)
hath altered and perverted: which doth evidently involve
your Priests, and Iesuites in a notorious and unavoydable Per∣jurie.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As for the note of <HI>Foolishnesse,</HI> what more mad
folly can there be seene in any, than to take upon them a serious
Defence of a <HI>Custome,</HI> for satisfaction of all others, and yet to
be so unsatisfied among themselves? so that both the Obje∣ctions <MILESTONE N="30"/>
urged by Protestants against that Abuse, are fortified, and
also all your Reasons for it are refuted, either by the direct Te∣stimonies
of your owne Doctors, or by the common Principles
and Tenents of your Church, or else by the Absurdities of your
Consequences issuing from your Reasons and Answers; divers
of them being no lesse grosse, than was your objecting the <HI>An∣tiquity</HI>
and <HI>Generality</HI> of the particular <HI>Romane Church,</HI> for lesse
than three hundred yeeres, and to preferre it before the confes∣sed
Vniversall primitive Custome of above the Compasse of a
Thousand yeares continuance before the other.<MILESTONE N="40"/></P>
<P>Fiftly, the last is the note of <HI>Blasphemy;</HI> for this name the
contempt of Christ his last Will and Testament must needs de∣serve;
and what greater contempt can there be, than contrary
to Christ his [<HI>Do this</HI>] (concerning Both kinds) to professe that
<HI>Sacrilegious dismembring</HI> of the holy Sacrament, which <HI>Gelasius</HI>
the Pope himselfe had anciently condemned? or if this be not
Blasphemous enough, then, supposing that Christ indeed had
<PB N="87" REF="61"/>
commanded Consecration in Both kindes, upon divine right,
yet notwithstanding to <HI>hold it very probable</HI> (as saith your Iesuit

my councell is that none of your Deerees be ever dispensed

man for his councell, for not <HI>Doing</HI> so; yet doubtlesse, would
he reward him with a welcome into the office of his holy Inqui∣sition,
for his judgement, to thinke it lawfull so to do: namely,
to leave it to the discretion of every Iesuite, to dispense with
his Papall Decrees. And notwithstanding the Iesuites [<HI>Suppose</HI>]
wee may depose, that your Romish licence, for but <HI>One kinde,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/> is a dispencing, or rather a despising of the Ordinance of
Christ.</P>

the Act of Christ being equally an Administration in only
<MILESTONE N="30"/> one kinde, and Both these equally done by the same <HI>Supreme

for these two words, <HI>Individuum,</HI> and <HI>Vagum,</HI> spoken of

if you speake of it in a confused Notion, no Abstract Notion
can be held in a man's hand, it being the function of the braine,
and not of the hand, to apprehend mentall Notions, or Gene∣ralls;
and so it is not <HI>Individuum</HI> at all.</P>
<P>But the Text saith of Christ his hand, [<HI>He tooke bread, &amp;c.</HI>]

if it betoken Literally <HI>Bread,</HI> as all Protestants affirme, then
by Vniversall consent, of even the Romish Doctors them∣selves,

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Our first Proposition.
The Verbe [EST] being joyned with a thing that is a
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Signe, is alwayes figurative, and the very
same with this word, SIG∣NIFIETH.
SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>FOr although the Verbe (<HI>Est</HI>) be indeed so absolutely simple,
in it's owne nature, that it cannot be resolved into any other
word (as all other Verbes may be in like Case) yet doth it (albe∣it
accidentally) necessarily inferre a <HI>figurative Sense,</HI> and is as
<MILESTONE N="30"/> much as <HI>Signifieth,</HI> or <HI>Representeth,</HI> whensoever it joyneth the
Signe and the Thing signified together. As for Example, A
man pointing at a signe hanging before an Inne, and saying, <HI>This
is Saint George,</HI> the Verbe <HI>Is</HI> can inferre no other Sense than
<HI>Signifieth.</HI> Why? even because the thing, whereof it speaketh,
is a <HI>Signe</HI> signifying <HI>Saint George.</HI> And <HI>Bread</HI> in this Sacrament
is in all Catholike Divinity a <HI>Signe</HI> of <HI>Christs Body.</HI> Therefore
the Verbe [<HI>Is</HI>] can have no other Sense than [<HI>Signifieth.</HI>]</P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The former Proposition confirmed by all like Speeches, whether
<MILESTONE N="40"/> Artificiall, Politike, or Mysticall.
SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>YOur owne Iesuites, and common Experience it selfe will ve∣rifie
this Truth. First, In things Artificiall, as<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Metonymia, tropus est in Scriptu∣ris frequentissimus, quâ continens pro contento, &amp; contrà signatum pro signo usurpari solet; ut ostensâ imagine Herculis, dici∣mus, Hic est Hercules. <HI>Salmeron Ies.

is more Common, than for a man to say of his Testament, <HI>This

Rites; as in Sacrifice, even among the Heathen, according to
that Example out of <HI>Homer,</HI> which is notable. The <HI>Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as</HI> and

<P>You have heard the Objection, which seeming to so great a <MILESTONE N="40"/>
Champion so greatly <HI>Convincent,</HI> you will give us licence to
<PB N="121" REF="78"/>
make a full Answer. First, by HOC ET HOC, THIS AND THIS (by
the Interpretation of <HI>Epiphanius</HI>) are meant, <HI>The things which the
Evangelist did mention;</HI> and the <HI>Evangelist</HI> mentioned (as you know)
<HI>Bread, [He tooke Bread, He tooke the Cup,</HI>] meaning <HI>Wine</HI> in the <HI>Cup,</HI>
namely, according to the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above Chap. 1. §. 6.</NOTE> former generall Consent of the Fathers,
[HOC] signifyed <HI>Bread</HI> in one part of the Eucharist, and <HI>Wine</HI> in the
other. But <HI>Bread</HI> neither in the <HI>Substance,</HI> nor in the <HI>Accidents</HI> can
be called <HI>Christs Body,</HI> without a <HI>Trope,</HI> as hath beene<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above Chap. 1. §. 4.</NOTE> Confessed:
which is our first confutation of your Cardinal, who concludeth that
<HI>Epiphanius excludeth all Tropes out of Christs Speech of</HI> [HOC.]</P>
<P>Secondly<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Epi∣phanius in An∣corato.</HI> Habent omnes id quod est secundùm I∣maginem Dei, sed non secun∣dùm naturam: non enim se∣cundùm aequa∣litatem habent homines, Deus enim mente in∣cō prehensibilis est, cum spiri∣tus sit super omnem spiritū.</NOTE> <HI>All men</HI> (saith <HI>Epiphanius) have the Image of God, al∣though
<MILESTONE N="10"/> not according to nature, or equality; because God, the Spirit of
Spirits, is Incomprehensible.</HI> Then he seeketh a <HI>Similitude</HI> from the <HI>Eu∣charist,</HI>
an <HI>Image</HI> of a thing which seemeth to be that, which in <HI>na∣ture</HI>
and <HI>equality</HI> it is not. Now in the Eucharist there are two things
to be distinguished, the one is the <HI>Naturall,</HI> the other is the <HI>Sacra∣mentall
Being</HI> thereof. The <HI>Naturall Being</HI> of the Elements, as of
<HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> cannot make this <HI>Similitude;</HI> because, whether they
be taken as Substances or Accidents, [<HI>Hoc, This</HI>] hath no propor∣tion
with the word which is called [<HI>Meum</HI>] meaning Christs Body,
because the <HI>Hoc</HI> (as <HI>Epiphanins</HI> saith) is a <HI>Round figure.</HI> But as <HI>Hoc</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/> and <HI>Hoc</HI> are Sacramentall <HI>Images,</HI> representing <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Meum,</HI>
Christs <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood:</HI> the <HI>Bread broken</HI> to betoken his <HI>Body cruci∣fyed,</HI>
and the <HI>Wine poured out</HI> a-part, to signifie Christs <HI>Blood Shed:</HI>
so will the <HI>Similitude</HI> be most Harmonicall. Even as <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI>
in the Eucharist, although they differ in <HI>nature,</HI> yet are they repre∣sentative
Signes and <HI>Images</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ. So the
<HI>Image</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in <HI>man,</HI> hath a resemblance of the <HI>Godhead,</HI> although in
respect of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Equality</HI> it be as different as Finite and Infi∣nite,
Comprehensible and Incomprehensible. According to which
Analogicall, Mysticall, and acramentall sense, upon the hearing of
these words of <HI>Epiphanius, Whosoever will not believe Christs words,
as hee said, falleth from grace,</HI> wee willingly shall say <HI>Amen.</HI> The ra∣ther,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> because <HI>Epiphanius</HI> being an Adversarie to the <HI>Marcionites,</HI>
who denyed Christ to have a <HI>True Body,</HI> but onely <HI>Phantasticall,</HI>
notwithstanding whatsoever proofe from mens senses, who saw and
felt them; they could not digest the Faith of the Romish Church,
which teacheth that that, which <HI>Epiphanius</HI> calleth <HI>Bread</HI> after Con∣secration,
should be (contrary to the Demonstration of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oure Senses,
as of <HI>Seeing, Smelling, Feeling</HI> and <HI>Tasting</HI>) meere Accidents.</P>
<P>Thirdly (a place as observable as any other) He saith of this, [<HI>Hoc</HI>]
<MILESTONE N="40"/> which is of a <HI>round figure,</HI> and differing in nature and proportion from
that [<HI>Meum</HI>] which is the <HI>Body of Christ,</HI> that it is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Insensible:</HI>
But how, Passively? as not being able to be perceived? No, for
then it could not be perceived to be <HI>Round.</HI> But Actively, as not able
to perceive any thing, in which respect hee opposeth it to [<HI>Meum,</HI>]
which is the <HI>Body of Christ.</HI> Which againe manifestly contradicteth
<PB N="122" REF="79"/>
the abominable cōmon doctrine of your Church, as you have heard,
of Believing the Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, to be un∣able
either to <HI>see</HI> or <HI>heare,</HI> or <HI>exercise any faculty of sense without a Mi∣racle;</HI>
as is shewed, Book. 4. Chap. 9. Sect. 2.</P>
<P>In the last place I require Iustice from your selves against a Pro∣ctor
of yours. The Case is this: <HI>Bellarmine said</HI> (quoth I) <HI>that Epi∣phanius
taught, We are to believe these words of Christ, although they be
repugnant to our senses:</HI> which last words [<HI>Although they be repugnant
to our senses</HI>] said I, No man of sense can find in <HI>Epiphanius.</HI> This saith
the Proctor is a <HI>false Taxation.</HI> And I, for my Iustification, shall de∣sire <MILESTONE N="10"/>

<P><HI>BEllarmine</HI> and <HI>Vasquez</HI> perceiving that if the Minister
should deliver these words of Christ [<HI>This is my Body</HI>]
<PB N="140" REF="88"/>
onely as <HI>Narratively,</HI> rehearsing them, then hee could not
therby consecrate the Bread, which is in his owne hands, be∣cause
it is not that Bread, which was then in Christs hands,
when he sayd [<HI>This is my Bodie.</HI>] And againe, if they should
be uttered of the Priest, as in the person of Christ, which
you call <HI>Significatively,</HI> as if Christ himselfe should now
speake them, by the mouth of the Priest; yet being Pro∣nounced
by the Priest, and not by Christ, the Priest in say∣ing,
[<HI>My Bodie,</HI>] should consecrate his owne Bodie, and
not the Bodie of Christ. They doe therefore assume and <MILESTONE N="10"/>
conclude, that the Priest uttereth these words both <HI>Mate∣rially</HI>
and <HI>Formally,</HI> that is, both <HI>Narratively,</HI> repeating
them as the Minister of Christ; and <HI>Significatively,</HI> pro∣nouncing
them in the person of Christ.</P>
<P>If they could illustrate this to be possible by any Similitudes,
wee should more easily beleeve them, but they cannot.
Let us try this. <HI>Bellarmine.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above in the former Section.</NOTE> <HI>It is</HI> (saith hee in the Margin)
<HI>as when the Angell of God, taking upon him the person of God,
said, [I am the God of your Fathers.</HI>] So hee. Wee (not to
dispute now the truth of his Assertion, in saying it was Gods <MILESTONE N="20"/>
Angell that sayd, <HI>I am the God of your Fathers,</HI> but to sup∣pose
it true) doe reply, that the Similitude is not appliable:
Because, if as the Priest repeating Christs words thus, [<HI>Iesus
gave it to his Disciples, saying, [This is my Bodie;</HI>] So the
Angell of God should have said, <HI>God speaketh unto you, say∣ing,
[I am the God of your Fathers;</HI>] Every one at the first
hearing would easily discerne that the Angell spake so, only
as a Minister, or (as the word, <HI>Angell,</HI> signifieth) a <HI>Messen∣ger</HI>

<MILESTONE N="20"/> SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>IT was alwayes held, by all Divines, to bee a most ne∣cessary,
exact, and securo Rule of interpreting of Scrip∣ture,
to expound a Text by the Context of the words pre∣ceding,
and the words following, <HI>Ianus</HI> wise, looking
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The words of the first Text are these, <HI>This
is my Body:</HI>] of the Second these, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>For this is the
New Testament in my Blood</HI>] as Saint <HI>Matthew</HI> hath it. Now
<MILESTONE N="30"/> the words which goe immediately before the former Text,
concerning the Acts of Christ, viz. [<HI>He</HI> (having taken Bread)
<HI>when hee had given thankes, brake it, saying, This is, &amp;c.</HI>]
are delivered by the Minister onely <HI>Narratively,</HI> namely,
rehearsing what Christ had done long since; and not any
Act now in doing by the Priest, in the person of Christ.
The words likewise preceding, in the Second Text, concer∣ning
the <HI>Cup,</HI> stand thus: [<HI>After Hee</HI> (Christ) <HI>had supped,
hee tooke the Cup, and when hee had given thankes, hee sayd,
Drinke you all of this, &amp;c.</HI>] which all are <HI>Narratives,</HI> re∣pearing
<MILESTONE N="40"/> what Christ had done. For the words are, HEE
(Christ) TOOKE; and not, <HI>I,</HI> the Minister: And HEE,
what? [<HI>Saying,</HI>] a word <HI>Narrative,</HI> in it's owne proper Sig∣nification.</P>
<P>Next marke the succeeding words of both your supposed
Consecratory Sayings of Christ, concerning the Bread [<HI>This

Cup:</HI> as likewise secondly concerning the <HI>Cup,</HI> the words
<PB N="142" REF="89"/>
succeeding, which are [SHED, <HI>for Remission of sins</HI>] are a

then by Christ.</P>
<P>We now demand, seeing the whole Contexture, whether
going before, or following after the Text in Controver∣sie,
are all words, onely rehearsing what Christ had done;
why should you conceive the Intervenient words [<HI>This is
my Bodie</HI>] to be uttered in a different tenure of speech, as
in the person of Christ? When wee should expect some
warrant hereof from some one Father, you are unanimously <MILESTONE N="10"/>
mute. When wee further inquire into your Reason, wee
finde none more semblable than this, That (according to
your familiar, and frequent <HI>Similitude of a Stage-Play</HI>) your
Priest is here (as it were) Acting in a Play, and exchanging

otherwise.</HI>] And yet the Apostle, when hee spake of the
Absolution, which hee gave, saying to the <HI>Corinthians, If

the Apostle, and Ancient Fathers, is to be understood
[<HI>Farre otherwise</HI>] than that which the <HI>Significative</HI> Romish
sense doth exact; which is, that the Priest so uttereth
Christ's words, in the person of Christ, that he delivereth
them <HI>Significatively,</HI> that is, as to signifie the same Intenti∣on
<MILESTONE N="10"/> in himselfe, in repeating those words, which Christ him∣selfe
had in the first uttering of them.</P>
<P>As for example, (it is your Cardinal's owne) <HI>Any one
repeating these words spoken of the wicked Iewes, Saying con∣cerning
Christ [This man Blasphemeth] if he should utter them
Significatively, that is, with the same Intention of noting
Christ to be a blasphemer, he himselfe should Blaspheme: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut
delivering them onely Narratively, by way of Repetition, hee
doth not Blaspheme, because he meaneth not to say that Christ
did Blaspheme, but that the Iewes said so.</HI> So he. And so say
<MILESTONE N="20"/> wee, That the Priest, in repeating of Christ's words [<HI>This is
my Body</HI>] pronounceth them <HI>Narratively</HI> onely, and not
<HI>Significatively.</HI> For the Romish Priest, if he should speake
the words of Christ <HI>Significatively, in the person of Christ,</HI>
that is, with the same Intention as Christ, when hee said
[<HI>This</HI>] of the Bread, then in his hands: the Priest saying,
[<HI>This</HI>] should intead and meane that [<HI>This Bread</HI>] whereof
Christ spake, and not that which is in his owne hands,

it in sound: it being just the same Doctrine, which <HI>Augustine,
Anselme,</HI> and <HI>Bede</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See hereafter Booke 5. Chap. 3. §. 1. &amp; 2.</NOTE> taught, when they said, that the faithfull

that is, the blood of Christ, <HI>in drinking the water that issued
out of the Rocke,</HI> which Christians now doe. And there∣fore
<PB N="160" REF="98"/>
meant not a Corporall eating of Christ, but a Sacra∣mentall.
So say wee, <HI>Christ could aswell then turne</HI> Manna, <HI>and</HI>

for the nourishing of the soules of God's people of those times;

<P>This Answer preventeth the Iesuites Objection:<NOTE N="10" PLACE="marg">In his Booke of Spectacles, p. 142.</NOTE> <HI>The
Time</HI> (saith he) <HI>when the people received Manna in the De∣sert,
Christ was not in his humane nature; therefore could not
Manna be changed into his Body, nor Water into his Blood.</HI> So <MILESTONE N="10"/>
he, very truly indeed. And therfore must <HI>AElfrick</HI> his speech
be understood <HI>Sacramentally,</HI> as hath beene said: which be∣cause
the Iesuite refuseth to do, therefore is he at difference
with <HI>AElfrick,</HI> denying that Christ was able to convert <HI>Man∣na</HI>
into his <HI>Body;</HI> which <HI>AElfrick</HI> said, in expresse termes, hee
was able to do (namely) thorow his divine power, by a <HI>Sacra∣mentall</HI>
Conversion; because <HI>Omnipotencie</HI> is as properly
necessary for the making of a divine Sacrament, as it was for
the creating of the World.</P>
<P>But was it not then kindly done (thinke you) of your Iesuit <MILESTONE N="20"/>
to lend his <HI>Spectacles</HI> to another, when he had the most need
of them himselfe? by the which he might have discerned,
that as Christ <HI>Sacramentally</HI> (and therefore figuratively) <HI>cal∣led
Bread his Body, and Wine his Blood;</HI> so did evermore all
the faithfull of Christ. This Lesson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Booke 2. C. 2. Sect. 10.</NOTE> hath beene manifested
by many pregnant Examples, in a full Section; which be∣ing
once got by heart, would expedite all the like Difficul∣ties.</P>
<P>To conclude, the former Saxon doctrine is againe confir∣med
by Saint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Booke 4. Chap. 4. §. 1. in the Challenge.</NOTE> <HI>Augustine.</HI> Wherefore wee may as truly say,<MILESTONE N="30"/>
concerning this your <HI>Conversion,</HI> that if it be by <HI>Transubstan∣tiation,</HI>
from <HI>Bread,</HI> then it is not the <HI>Body,</HI> which was <HI>Borne
of the Blessed Virgin,</HI> as your owne Romish Glosse could say
of the Predication;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above B. 2. Chap. 1. §. 4.</NOTE> <HI>If Bread be Christ's Body, then some∣thing
was Christ's Body, which was not borne of the Virgin Ma∣ry.</HI>
And this wee are now furthermore to evince out of
your Pope <HI>Innocent the Third,</HI> against your <HI>Councel of Trent.</HI>
He (See the Margent of the former Section) taught that
when the <HI>Conversion is of the forme with the substance,</HI> then
is the <HI>Change Into that which is now made, and was not before, as <MILESTONE N="40"/>
when the Rod was turned into a Serpent.</HI> So he, shewing that
the <HI>Serpent by that Change was therefore Made of that Rod.</HI>
But your Tridentine Fathers (you know) have defined the
<HI>Conversion of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body</HI> to be
aswell in <HI>Forme,</HI> as in <HI>Matter;</HI> whereupon by the Iudgement
of your <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> it must follow, that the <HI>Body</HI> of Christ
in your Eucharist is <HI>made of Bread;</HI> and if made of <HI>Bread,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="98"/>
then could it not possibly be of the flesh of the Virgin: Be∣cause
there cannot be a Substantiall Change of a Substance
into Substance, except that the Substance of that, whereinto
the Conversion is wrought, have it's Originall and <HI>Making</HI>
from the Substance of that, which was converted and chan∣ged.
Nor could the Contrary be hitherto proved by any
Romish Doctor, from any Example out of any conversion ei∣ther
naturall, or miraculous, which hath beene road of from

<HEAD>Good Proofes of the Existence, and Continuance of Bread

Our first Proofe is from Scripture, 1. Cor. 10. &amp; 11.
<MILESTONE N="40"/> Saint Paul calling it [Bread.]
SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Apostle his Comment (that I may so call his two
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 26, 27. &amp; 10. 16.</NOTE> Chapters to the <HI>Corinthians</HI>) upon the Institution of Christ,
we reade of <HI>Eating the Bread,</HI> and <HI>Drinking the Cup,</HI> thrice:
all which, by the consent of all sides, are spoken of <HI>Eating and
Drinking after Consecration;</HI> and yet hath hee called the our∣ward
<PB N="162" REF="99"/>
Element <HI>Bread.</HI> You will say (with Some) It was so
called onely because it was made of <HI>Bread;</HI> as <HI>Aärons Rod,</HI> tur∣ned
into a <HI>Serpent,</HI> was notwithstanding called a <HI>Rod.</HI> But
this Answer is not Answerable unto the Similitude. For first,
of the <HI>Bread,</HI> the Apostle saith demonstratively, <HI>This bread;</HI>
and of the other, <HI>This Cup:</HI> But of <HI>Aärons Rod,</HI> turned into a
<HI>Serpent,</HI> none could say, <HI>This Rod.</HI> And secondly, it is contrary
to Christian Faith, which will abhorre to say, in a proper sense,
that <HI>Christs Body</HI> was ever <HI>Bread.</HI> Or else you will answer, with
Others, It is yet called <HI>Bread,</HI> because it hath the <HI>Similitude of
Bread,</HI> as the <HI>Brazen Serpent</HI> was called a <HI>Serpent.</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/></P>
<P>But neither this, nor any other of your Imaginations can sa∣tisfie;
for we shall proove, that the Apostle would never have
called it <HI>Bread after Consecration,</HI> but because it was <HI>Substanti∣ally,</HI>
still, <HI>Bread.</HI> Our Reason is; He had now to deale against
the Prophaners of this Sacrament, in reproving such as used it
as Common Bread,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Not discerning therein</HI> (Sacramentally ex∣hibited)
<HI>the Lords Body.</HI> It had therefore concerned him to have
honored the Sacrament with Divine Titles, agreeable to the Bo∣dy
of Christ, hypostatically united to his Godhead, and to have
denied it absolutely to have beene <HI>Bread,</HI> considering that by <MILESTONE N="20"/>
the name of <HI>Bread</HI> the glory of the same <HI>Body</HI> might seeme to
be abased, and Eclipsed; if in Truth, and Verity he had not be∣leeved
it to have beene (then) properly <HI>Bread.</HI></P>
<P>This Reason, we guesse, you are bound to approve off, who, in
your opinion of the <HI>Corporall Presence</HI> of Christ his <HI>Body,</HI> and
<HI>Absence of Bread,</HI> would never suffer any of your Professors to
call it, <HI>after Consecration,</HI> by the name of <HI>Bread.</HI> Whereupon it
was that the Greeke<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><HI>Archi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pisc.

wee call the Symbols and Signes Bread, and Wine.</HI> So he.
Which bewrayeth, that the very naming of the Sacrament
<HI>Bread, and Wine,</HI> is, in the judgement of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
prejudiciall to their <HI>Transubstantiation;</HI> and that if Saint <HI>Paul</HI>
himselfe should deliver the same words he did, at this day, hee
should by your Romish Inquisitors be taught to use his Termes
in another stile. What need many words? except in the words
of Christ the word [<HI>Body</HI>] be properly predicated, and affir∣med
of <HI>Bread,</HI> farewell <HI>Transubstantiation of Bread into Christs <MILESTONE N="40"/>
Body.</HI> But that it is impossible the <HI>Body of Christ</HI> should bee
properly predicated upon <HI>Bread,</HI> hath beene the Generall Con∣fession
of your owne Doctors, and the Conclusion of our se∣cond
Booke.</P>
<P>{fleur-de-lys}Wee returne againe to the Text, where the Apostle
having named it <HI>Bread,</HI> after Consecration, expoundeth
himselfe what <HI>Bread</HI> he meant, saying, <HI>Bread which we breake.</HI>

of the Accidents of Bread.</HI> And therefore it must follow, that
it was still substantially Bread.</P>
<P>The Apostle hath not yet done, but 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 17. sayth, <HI>Be∣cause

Thus hath Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> the Scholler of <HI>Christ,</HI> concluded of

<P><MILESTONE N="40"/> THis Apologie of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> in behalfe of the verity of the

First, not to conceit of <HI>Accidents</HI> without <HI>Subjects:</HI> but to dis∣cerne
of <HI>Subjects,</HI> and <HI>Substances,</HI> by their <HI>Accidents.</HI> Second∣ly,
that our <HI>Outward Senses</HI> rightly constituted (more especially

<HI>Accidents,</HI> is common with <HI>Christ,</HI> his <HI>Apostles,</HI> all <HI>Christians,</HI>
and with every reasonably man. And lastly, that <HI>VVine</HI> is to be
discerned to be truly and naturally <HI>VVine, after Consecration,</HI>
by the judgement of the <HI>Senses,</HI> because he instanceth in this
very point: teaching that Christ had the same taste of Substan∣tiall
<HI>VVine</HI> afterwards, which hee had before in that which hee
consecrated; even as he had also the same <HI>Sent of Substantiall
Oyntment</HI> after, which hee had before his <HI>Buriall.</HI> And all
this even now, when he convinced <HI>Marcion</HI> of <HI>Heresie,</HI> an Ene∣mie

humane naturall Body,</HI> notwithstanding the Evidence of <HI>Man's

<P>Here had beene a full and flat Evasion for that <HI>Heretike</HI> to

Senses, concerning the Truth of <HI>Christ's Body,</HI> seeing you your∣selves
gain-say the judgement of foure Senses at once, in de∣nying
the <HI>Existence of Bread in this Sacrament?</HI> This, we say,
they must needs have replyed, if that the Catholikes then had

all this Catholike Confutation of <HI>Heretikes</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> with

<P>Come now hither all yee that say wee must renounce all

<HI>Coldnesse, Hotnesse, Sweetnesse, Sowernesse,</HI> and of other the
like Accidents hapning to the same Sacrament, after Con∣secration,
cannot bee so called either in respect of <HI>Quantity</HI>
or <HI>Quality,</HI> it remaineth that the Subject of them must bee
a materiall substance, which, as you your selves (we know)
will sweare cannot bee the Body of Christ; for you dare not
say of it, that it in your <HI>touch</HI> or <HI>tast</HI> is either <HI>Cold, Sweet,</HI> or
<HI>Sower,</HI> You must therefore give us leave to beleeve it to bee <MILESTONE N="40"/>
still the <HI>Substance of Bread.</HI> And this our Argument taketh
away your Fancy of Accidents without a Subject; else must
<PB N="177" REF="106"/>
you affirme that he, or shee, whosoever shall make the Host,
after it bee Consecrated, either <HI>Hote, Sweet,</HI> or <HI>Sowre,</HI> doth in
so doing make so many Miracles of Accidents, which are
void of their Subjects; which unnecessary multiplication

<HEAD>Our First Proofe, that Bread remaineth Bread in Substance, after

SECT. XI.</HEAD>
<P>TEstimonies of Ancient Fathers inferre a necessary Con∣sequence,
for proofe of the <HI>Existence of Bread and Wine</HI>
in this Sacrament, as might bee proved partly by the repe∣tition
of many Arguments premised, and partly by intimati∣on
<MILESTONE N="20"/> of other Arguments afterwards expressed. But wee shall be
content with, those few, which do more properly appertaine
to this present Dispute, concerning the nature of a Body. First
<HI>Irenaeus,</HI> speaking of the Eucharist <HI>after Consecration,</HI> as being
<HI>not now common Bread,</HI> sayd that<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg"><HI>Irenaeus, lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 34.

and it must infallibly follow, that as our <HI>Bodies,</HI> albeit substan∣tially
<HI>Earthly,</HI> are notwithstanding called <HI>Incorruptible,</HI> in re∣spect
<MILESTONE N="30"/> of the Glory and Immortality, in which (through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope)
it hath an Interest; Even so the <HI>Earthly substance</HI> of this Sacra∣ment,
being <HI>Bread,</HI> is neverthelesse indued with a sacred and
Divine property of a <HI>Sacramentall Representation</HI> of Christ's
Body. Which Sacrament <HI>Origen</HI> calling <HI>Sanctified meat,</HI> saith

<P><HI>THeodoret</HI> maketh a <HI>Dialogue,</HI> or Conference betweene two
Parties, being in Controversie about the <HI>humane and bodily
nature of Christ;</HI> the one is named <HI>Eranistes,</HI> upon whom is
imposed the person of an <HI>Heretike,</HI> for Defence of the Sect of
the <HI>Eutychians,</HI> who (falsly) held, <HI>That the Body of Christ, af∣ter
his Ascension, being glorified, was swallowed up of his Deitie,
and continued no more the same humane and Bodily Essence, as be∣fore
his Resurrection</HI> it had beene. The other Party and Dis∣puter
is named <HI>Orthodoxus,</HI> signifying the <HI>Defender of the Truth</HI>
of the Catholike Doctrine; which Person <HI>Theodoret</HI> himselfe <MILESTONE N="30"/>
did sustaine, in behalfe of the Catholike Church. In this Dis∣pute
the <HI>Heretike</HI> is brought in, for Defence of his <HI>Heresie,</HI> ar∣guing
thus; <HI>Even as Signes in the Eucharist, after the words of
Invocation</HI> (or <HI>Consecration) are not the same, but are changed in∣to
the Body of Christ: even so, after his Ascension, was his Body
changed into a Divine</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,] meaning, <HI>Substance of a Divine
Essence.</HI> Which both your Romanistes and Protestants confesse
to have beene the Doctrine of these <HI>Heretikes.</HI></P>
<P>This was that <HI>Heretike</HI> his Objection. The <HI>Orthodoxe,</HI> or
Catholike (which was <HI>Theodoret</HI> himselfe) cometh to answer,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
promising to <HI>catch the heretike,</HI> as he saith, <HI>in his owne Snare,</HI>
by retorting his Argument of <HI>Similitude</HI> against him, thus:

depart not from their former nature, but continue in
their former Figure, Forme and</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] that is, <HI>Substance. So the
Body of Christ, after the Resurrection, remaineth in its former
Figure, Forme, Circumscription, and</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>], or <HI>Substance which
it had before.</HI> You may perceive that the Assertion, set downe
in the name of a Grand <HI>Heretike,</HI> is absolutely your Romish
Profession for <HI>Transubstantiation</HI> at this day, (to wit) <HI>Bread is
changed after Consecration into the Substance of Christ's Body;</HI>
and that also the Assertion of <HI>Theodoret,</HI> in the person of the
<MILESTONE N="10"/> Catholike Professor, being flat contradictory, is as absolutely
the Doctrine of <HI>Protestants,</HI> defending that <HI>Bread after Conse∣cration
remaineth in Substance the same.</HI> Wherefore if ever, it

<P>The Principall Answer is that, which your<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Non loquitur de substantiâ, quae di∣stinguitur contra Ac∣cidentia, &amp; quam in Categori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>â posuit A∣ristoteles; sed de Es∣sentiâ, &amp; naturâ Ac∣cidentium. <HI>Bellar. l.</HI> 2. <HI>de Euch. c.</HI> 27. §.

are Accidents.</HI> An answer (by your leave) No oriously, Ri∣diculously,
and Heretically False.</P>
<P>First, Notoriously false, because the Argument of <HI>Theodo∣ret,</HI>
being taken from a <HI>Similitude,</HI> and every <HI>Similitude</HI> con∣sisting
of two Propositions, the first called <HI>Protasis,</HI> and the o∣ther
<HI>Apodosis,</HI> it is necessary by the Rule of <HI>Logike;</HI> (as you
know) that the words and termes, betokening the same Simili∣tude,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> be used in the same signification in both Propositions. But
in the <HI>Apodosis</HI> of <HI>Theodoret,</HI> which is this: <HI>So the Body of Christ,
after the Resurrection, remaineth the same in Figure, Forme,</HI> and
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; by the word [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] was meant properly <HI>Substance,</HI> because
this was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the maine point in Question betweene
<HI>Theodoret</HI> and the <HI>Heretike,</HI> viz. whether the <HI>Substance of Christ's
Body continued the same,</HI> which it had beene in time <HI>before his
Resurrection;</HI> (the <HI>Heretike</HI> denying it, and <HI>Theodoret</HI> proving it
to be absolutely still <HI>the same in Substance:</HI>) and not whether
the same onely in <HI>Quantities,</HI> and <HI>Accidents;</HI> for those the A∣postle
<MILESTONE N="40"/> teacheth to be alterable,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 15. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Corruption putting on Incorrup∣tion,
Mortality Imortality, and shame Glory.</HI> Therefore in the
<HI>Protasis,</HI> and first Proposition of that comparison of <HI>Theodoret,</HI>
(which was this, <HI>As the Bread remaineth the same in Figure,
Forme, and</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the word [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] can have no other signification
than <HI>Substance,</HI> properly taken.</P>
<P>Secondly, Ridiculously false, because in reckoning <HI>Figure</HI>
and <HI>Forme,</HI> which are knowne to bee <HI>Accidents,</HI> and ad∣ding
<PB N="182" REF="109"/>
[<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] this necessarily is opposed to the former Two, as
<HI>Substance</HI> to <HI>Accidents.</HI> Nor was there (we suppose) ever any so
unlearned, who did adde the word [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] to <HI>Formes,</HI> and <HI>Fi∣gures,</HI>
but hee therby meant to distinguish it as a <HI>Substance</HI> from
its <HI>Accidents.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Heretically false; for what was the <HI>Heresie</HI> of the
<HI>Eutychians?</HI> tell us; <HI>They</HI> (say<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Alphonsua à Ca∣stro, de Haeres. Eurych.</HI> Negabant Christum habuisse naturam hu∣manam; tantùm in eo ponentes naturam divinam.</NOTE> you) <HI>held that Christ</HI> (namely
after his Resurrection) <HI>had not an humane nature, but onely Di∣vine.</HI>
Which word, <HI>Humane Nature,</HI> doth principally imply
the <HI>Substantiall nature</HI> of Man; and therefore in his compari∣son,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
made for the illustration of that <HI>Heresie</HI> concerning <HI>Bread,
after Consecration, in Figure, Forme,</HI> and [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] the same
word [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] had the same signification of <HI>Substance,</HI> as your
Master <HI>Brerely</HI> afterwards is compelled to confesse: who, to
the end he may disgrace <HI>Theodoret,</HI> rudely and wildly taketh
upon him to justifie the <HI>Heretikes</HI> speech to be Catholike, for
proofe of <HI>Transubstantiation.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>Theodoret,</HI> in his Answer, <HI>Retorting</HI> (as hee him∣selfe
saith) <HI>the Heretikes Comparison, against him,</HI> did, by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
likewise understand <HI>Substance,</HI> else had he not disputed <HI>ad Idem;</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
but by a shamefull Tergiversation had betraid his Catholike
Cause unto that pernitious <HI>Heretike.</HI> Much like as if one should
use this Comparison following. As the Moone-shine in the
water (in the opinion of the Vulgar) is truly of the same bignesse

blusheth not to regest the same; albeit, as one conscious to him∣selfe

upon <HI>Theodoret,</HI> as though that Father had beene in some di∣stemper,
when he so, writ:<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">In his Liturg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Masse. Tract. 2. §. 2 subd. 3. p. 254.</NOTE> saying, first, that <HI>Theodoret

part with the <HI>Heretike,</HI> saying, <HI>It is not likely that an Heretike

<MILESTONE N="10"/> had beene then either unknowne, or else condemned, as False.</HI> So
hee, who might aswell have reasoned, in the behalfe of the <HI>Sad∣duces,</HI>
condemned by Christ, saying: <HI>It is not likely that they

was judged execrable in that Church.</P>
<P><HI>Now if the</HI> Eutychian Heretike <HI>finde such Patronage at the

<MILESTONE N="20"/> Theodoret? <HI>Hearken,</HI> Theodoret being an Orthodoxe Bishop (<HI>saith
hee</HI>) could not have propounded the Heretikes Argument, as groun∣ded
upon the Churches received Doctrine of Transubstantiation,
had the same beene then unknowne, and reputed False. <HI>So he, who
if hee had not lost his</HI> Logike, <HI>would certainly have argued con∣trarily,
saying;</HI> Theodoret, being an Orthodoxe and Catholike
Bishop, would never have set downe an Objection for Transubstan∣tiation,
in the name of a ranke Heretike, and after himselfe impug∣ned
and confuted the same, except he had knowne it to be flatly re∣pugnant
to the Catholike Church in his time. Wherefore if you
<MILESTONE N="30"/> be men of Faith, and not rather of Faction, let the miserable

(saith your Romane<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Solus Deus (communi Consen∣su) instituere Sacra∣menta ex authori∣tate potest, quae gra∣tiam efficiunt, aut etiam infallibiliter significant. <HI>Bellar. l.</HI> 1. <HI>de Sacram. in Gen. cap.</HI> 23.</NOTE> Cardinall) <HI>that God onely can by his Autho∣rity

Well then, aswell <HI>infallible Signification of Grace,</HI> as the effica∣cious
conveyance of Grace, is the worke of the same <HI>Omnipo∣cencie.</HI>
To this purpose more plainly your English Cardinall
<MILESTONE N="30"/><HI>Alan,</HI> speaking (as hee saith) <HI>from the judgement of Di∣vines,</HI>
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Card. Alan de Sacram. in Gen. c.</HI> 17. <HI>&amp;</HI> 18. Sacramenti Institutionem neque ad Pontificem; ne{que} ad ullam Creaturam pertinere: nec hoc solum sed etiam, &amp;c—propter solam significationem Gratiae, quam Sacramentis omnibus Communem diximus, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bebant etiam vetera Sacramenta determinari per applicationem mortis Christi: quia licet quidem in Creaturis, ad signationem effectuum spiritualium, aptitudo quaedam sit, tamen ista aptitudo non nisi a divinâ institutione determina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur ad peculiarem effectum. Habet enim Aqua ex natura sua ut munditiem signi∣ficet, at ut determinatè purgationem animae à peccato originali significet, &amp; hominis sanctificationem reprae∣sentet; divinae tantùm institutionis est, per quam elevatur Creatura haec supra naturae consuetudinem, non solùm quoad vim operandi, sed etiam significandi.

every Creature to beare a signification of some spirituall effect, yet
cannot the aptnesse be determinatly applyed unto any peculiar effect,
no not so much as to signifie the outward Cleannesse of mans Body
(Sacramentally) without a Divine Institution; much lesse to
represent mans sanctification: but being so determinated and or∣dained
of God, the Creature</HI> (saith hee) <HI>is elevated above the Cu∣stome
of nature, not only in respect of the worke of sanctification,
<MILESTONE N="40"/> but even of signification also.</HI> So hee; and that as well as wee
<PB N="190" REF="114"/>
could wish: for this <HI>Omnipotent Change</HI> of a <HI>Creature</HI> into a
<HI>Sacrament,</HI> and this <HI>Iustrumentall Cause</HI> of conferring Sancti∣fying
<HI>Grace,</HI> to the Faithfull Communicant, is the Generall
Doctrine of all <HI>Protestants.</HI> But what Change shall we thinke?
Of the <HI>Substance of Bread</HI> into the <HI>Substance of Christs Body,</HI> as
you teach? No; but as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Booke 2. Chap. 3. §. 6.</NOTE> before <HI>Isidore</HI> sayd, <HI>The Change of

<P>Seeing then that both Divine power and authority is requi∣red
in every <HI>Sacrament,</HI> to make it either infallibly significant,
or else efficaciously profitable to man; and that it is by the same
Divine power that the <HI>Element</HI> is <HI>Changed,</HI> by being <HI>Elevated
from a common,</HI> unto a spirituall and divine property of a <HI>Sa∣cramentall
Signification,</HI> as one of your Cardinalls hath sayd:

<P>But much more transparent will their Vnconscionablenesse
bee, if we consult with the Objected Fathers themselves. For

<HI>Transubstantiation</HI> by a Similitude; comparing the <HI>Humanity,</HI>

which hee calleth <HI>Created,</HI> that <HI>It is divided.</HI></P>

<P>Wee grant, first, that the <HI>Divine Essence,</HI> which is the di∣vine
power of Christ, is exercised in every Sacrament, by
making it effectuall to the salvation of the Communicants.
Secondly, that by the word, <HI>Verity,</HI> or <HI>Truth,</HI> is meant the
Reality of his <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood.</HI> And Thirdly, that every one
that approacheth to this Sacrament, ought to come with a

is, how Christ's Body and Blood are said to bee <HI>Sa∣craments</HI>
of the <HI>Reality</HI> of his <HI>Body and Blood,</HI> here mentio∣ned?
and your onely Answer is, that <HI>Christ is a figure and

is easily confuted by a Catholike and universall doctrine of
all Christian Churches, which is, that every <HI>Sacrament is a

<HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood of Christ,</HI> properly taken, are nothing lesse

to bee so <HI>Invisible</HI> herein, that they cannot bee discerned
either by <HI>Angel,</HI> or the <HI>Bodily eyes</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> himselfe. You
perceive by this, that your Boast of this Place of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> is
but a vaine blast.</P>
<P>Wherefore wee expound the words thus; <HI>Christ's Body</HI>
and <HI>Blood</HI> (that is) the outward <HI>Symbols,</HI> carrying the names
of his <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> are <HI>Sacraments,</HI> and Seales of that <HI>Ve∣rity</HI>

it is in his Catechisme, wherein the use of all things is delive∣red

deale more falsely? For upon due examination it will appeare
to be a <HI>manifest Delusion,</HI> by a false Translation of <HI>Cyrils</HI> words.
<HI>The Body of Christ is given</HI> (as your Cardinall doth render it)
[<HI>sub specie Panis] in, or under the forme of Bread;</HI> whereas it is in
the Greeke,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyril.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Cate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mystag.</HI> 4. <HI>Russus Mystag.</HI> 5.

<HI>Thinke not that you taste bread, but the Antitype of

and <HI>Antitype;</HI> not <HI>Forme,</HI> or <HI>Figure of Bread.</HI></P>
<P>Now there is a maine and manifest difference betweene <MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Forme,</HI> and <HI>Type.</HI> For <HI>Accidentall Formes</HI> are things Reall, and
the determinate Objects of <HI>Sense;</HI> but <HI>Types,</HI> or <HI>Antitypes</HI> are
onely <HI>Relatives,</HI> and (as such) no <HI>Objects of Sense,</HI> but of <HI>Rea∣son,</HI>
and understanding onely. As for example, when a Iudge
is set in his Scarlet upon the Bench, the Eye seeth nothing
but the colour, and the fashion of the Gowne, and outward fi∣gurature
of his Face, and so may every Child see him; for
these are Outward and Visible Accidents. But to see that man,
as he hath upon him the person of a <HI>Iudge,</HI> ordained to trie Cau∣ses <MILESTONE N="40"/>
betweene Parties, is a sight of the minde, which looketh
upon his Office, to discerne him by his Habit from common
Subjects. Even so is it in this Sacrament; As the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI>
are <HI>Round,</HI> and <HI>White,</HI> and <HI>Sweet in Taste,</HI> our Bodily <HI>Senses</HI>
perceive them; but as they are <HI>Types,</HI> and <HI>Antitypes,</HI> that is,
<HI>Signes of the Body and Blood of Christ,</HI> so are they spiritually
discerned with our understanding onely.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="117"/>
As therefore it followeth not, that the <HI>Scarlet Gowne of the
Iudge,</HI> because it is an Ensigne of his Office, should be onely
Colour and Fashion, without the matter and Substance of the
Cloth; no more can any conclude from <HI>Cyril,</HI> that because
the Sacrament is a <HI>Type,</HI> therefore this <HI>Type</HI> was onely <HI>Forme,</HI>
and outward <HI>Accidents,</HI> without all <HI>Substance of Bread.</HI> And
thus your Cardinall his first [<HI>Apertissimum Argumentum</HI>] for
proofe of <HI>Accidents,</HI> without the <HI>Substance of Bread</HI> in this Sa∣crament,
is proved to be <HI>Apertissimum Figmentum,</HI> void of all
<MILESTONE N="10"/> substance, or almost shadow of Truth.</P>
<P>His next Observation is the <HI>Change by Transubstantiation,</HI> and
the errour of <HI>Sense,</HI> in judging it to be <HI>Bread.</HI> Wee call upon
<HI>Cyril</HI> to decide this Controversie, who is best able to interpret

<HI>It is not Bare Bread,</HI> but the <HI>Body of Christ,</HI> affirmed as

<MILESTONE N="20"/>(that is) <HI>Sanctified Oyle,</HI> after Consecration. So your Cardinall.
And so are wee posed for ever. But behold another Iesuiticall
Fraud! For <HI>Cyril</HI> as hee called the <HI>Consecrated Bread Christ's
Body,</HI> after Consecration, so doth hee call the <HI>Consecrated Oyle
[Charisma</HI>] that is, <HI>the Gift of the Grace of Christ;</HI> and not
[<HI>Chrisma</HI>] that is, <HI>Chrisme, or Oyntment,</HI> as your Cardinall ren∣dreth
it.</P>
<P>Wee say againe hee calleth that <HI>Charisma,</HI> which notwith∣standing
hee saith was, after Consecration, still <HI>Oyle,</HI> where∣with
their <HI>Foreheads were anointed.</HI> This must we Iudge to have
<MILESTONE N="30"/> beene a notable Falsification of <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> except you would
rather we should thinke, that when hee was now to prove that
our <HI>Senses</HI> are deceived, in judging of <HI>Bread</HI> to bee <HI>Bread,</HI> hee
meant to prove it by seeming to be deceived himselfe, in thus
mistaking the word <HI>Chrisma,</HI> for<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Cyril. Ca∣tech. Mystag. 3.</NOTE> and so utter∣ly
perverting the Iudgement of <HI>Cyril;</HI> by whom we are contra∣rily
taught, that the <HI>Sight</HI> is no more deceived in judging <HI>Bread</HI>
to be <HI>Bread,</HI> than in discerning <HI>Oyle</HI> to be <HI>Oyle.</HI> For neither was
the other <HI>Bare Oyle,</HI> being a <HI>Type of a spirituall Gift;</HI> nor yet was
it therefore changed into the <HI>Spirituall Grace</HI> it selfe, because it
<MILESTONE N="40"/> is so called; but onely is a <HI>Type</HI> and <HI>Symbol</HI> thereof. Which

<P>Fiftly, that the Sentence objected against us, is adorned with
<PB N="200" REF="119"/>
the same figure <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> when he saith that <HI>No sensible thing
is delivered unto us in this Sacrament, and that our senses herein
may be deceived.</HI> Words sore pressed by you, yet twice uncon∣scionably;

<P>Sixtly, that <HI>Chrysostome</HI> himselfe well knew he did <HI>Hyperbo∣lize</HI>
herein, who after that hee had sayd, <HI>No sensible thing is de∣livered
unto us in this Sacrament;</HI> notwithstanding, hee addeth <MILESTONE N="10"/>
immediately, saying of this Sacrament, that <HI>In things Sensible,
things Intelligible are given unto us.</HI> Thus farre of the Rheto∣rike
of <HI>Chrysostome.</HI></P>
<P>Now are wee to shew his <HI>Theologie,</HI> and Catholike meaning,
as it were the Kernel of his Speech. Hee in the same Sentence
will have us understand Man to consist of <HI>Body and Soule,</HI> and
accordingly in this Sacrament <HI>Sensible things</HI> are ministred to
the <HI>Body,</HI> as <HI>Symbols of spirituall things,</HI> which are for the Soule
to feed upon. So that a Christian, in receiving this Sacrament,
is not wholly to exercise his minde upon the bodily Object, as <MILESTONE N="20"/>
if that were onely, or principally the thing offered unto us;
No, for then indeed our Senses would deceive our Soules of
their spirituall Benefit. As for <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> and <HI>Absence
of Bread, Chrysostome,</HI> in true Sense, maketh wholly against it,
by explaining himselfe, and paralleling this Sacrament with
<HI>Baptisme: As in Baptisme</HI> (saith<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Sicut in Baptis∣mo, &amp;c. <HI>Chrysost. See above,</HI> §. 5. <HI>at</HI> (r.)</NOTE> he) <HI>Regeneration, the thing

the <HI>Existence of Bread after Consecration,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above Chap 3. §. 13.</NOTE> hath beene al∣ready

<HEAD>Fourthly, the Vnconscionablenesse of your Disputers, in urging
other Figurative Sayings, and Phrases of the Fathers, of
Bread Changed, Transmuted, &amp;c. into the Body

thereof in a Proper Sense.
<MILESTONE N="20"/> SECT VII.</HEAD>
<P>SVch words as these, <HI>Bread is the Body of Christ; It is made
the Body of Christ; It is Changed, Translated, Trans-muted,
Trans-elementated into the Body of Christ,</HI> are Phrases of the
highest <HI>Emphasis</HI> that you can finde in the Volumes of Anti∣ty;
which if they were literally meant, according to your Ro∣mish
Sense, there ought to be no further Dispute. But if it may
evidently appeare, by the Idiome of speech of the same Fa∣thers,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> that such their Sayings are <HI>Tropicall,</HI> and sometimes
<HI>Hyperbolicall,</HI> then shall wee have just Cause to taxe your Dis∣puters
of as great Vnconscionablenesse (if not of more) in this,
as in any other.</P>
<P>For whensoever they finde in any Father (as in<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Eusebias Emiss.</HI> Adest Substantia Pa∣nis, sed post verba Christi est Corpus Christi. <HI>Hom.</HI> 5. <HI>Ob∣jected by Mr. Brerely.

these words; <HI>The Bread is the Body of Christ;</HI> they object it for
<HI>Transubstantiation;</HI> but Vnconscionably. First, seeing that
the Fathers do but herein imitate our Lord and Master Christ,
who said of the <HI>Bread [This is my Body:</HI>] which hath beene
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above B. 2. throughout.</NOTE> proved by <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>Fathers</HI> to be a <HI>Figurative</HI> and
<MILESTONE N="40"/> unproper speech. Secondly, seeing that they use the same
Dialect in other things, as <HI>Cyril</HI> of <HI>Sacred Oyle,</HI> saying, <HI>this is

<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Cyrill. sup.</NOTE> <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> and Others the like, as you have heard.
Thirdly, seeing that you your selves have renounced all

Our Argument then from thence may be this. See∣ing
<HI>Accidents of Bread</HI> cannot nourish, then certainely the
<HI>substance of Bread,</HI> in this Sacrament, which giveth a <HI>bodily

SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>THere may be observed Foure kinds of <HI>Truths</HI> of Christ his
Presence in this Sacrament: one is <HI>Veritas Signi,</HI> that is,<MILESTONE N="10"/>
Truth of <HI>Representation</HI> of Christ his Body; the next is <HI>Veritas
Revelationis,</HI> Truth of <HI>Revelation;</HI> the third is <HI>Veritas Obsigna∣tionis,</HI>
that is, a Truth of <HI>Seale,</HI> for better assurance; the last is,
<HI>Veritas Exhibitionis,</HI> the Truth of <HI>Exhibiting,</HI> and deliverance
of the Reall Body of Christ to the faithfull <HI>Communicants.</HI> The
Truth of the <HI>Signe,</HI> in respect of the thing signified, is to be ac∣knowledged
so farre, as in the <HI>Signes of Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> is re∣presented
the true and Reall Body and Blood of Christ: which
Truth and Realty is celebrated by us, and taught by ancient
Fathers, in contradiction to <HI>Manichees, Marcionites,</HI> and other <MILESTONE N="20"/>
old <HI>Heretikes;</HI> who held that Christ had in himselfe no true
Body, but meerely <HI>Phantasticall,</HI> as you<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Marcionitae, Manichaei, &amp; alij Haeretici putabant corpus Christi verum non esse, sed phan∣tasticum esse. <HI>Bellar. lib.</HI> 3. <HI>de Eucharist. cap.</HI> 24. §. Resp. Ar∣gumentum.</NOTE> your selves well

[<HI>True, and the Argument of Ignatius was the same which Tertullian used also against the same kinde of Heretikes: Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>in Marcion.</HI> [Hoc est corpus me∣um] Id est, figura corporis mei: Figura autem non fuisset, nisi veritas esset corpus. <HI>See this in the place of Ter∣tullian at large.</HI></NOTE> Cardinall witnesseth) called the <HI>Eucharist</HI> it selfe, <HI>the
flesh of Christ.</HI> Which Saying of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> in the sense of <HI>Theo∣doret,</HI>
(by whom hee is cited, against the Heresie of his time)
doth call it <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> of Christ, because (as the same
<HI>Theodoret</HI> expounded himselfe) <HI>it is a true signe of the true and
Reall Body of Christ.</HI> So your Cardinall, even as <HI>Tertullian</HI>
long before him had explained the words of Christ himselfe, <MILESTONE N="30"/>
[<HI>This is my Body</HI>] that is (saith hee) <HI>This Bread is a Signe, or
Figure of my Body.</HI> Now because it is not a <HI>Signe,</HI> which is not
of some <HI>Truth</HI> (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above, Booke 2. Chap. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 9.</NOTE> for as much as there is not a figure of a figure)
therefore <HI>Bread</HI> being a Signe of Christs <HI>Body,</HI> it must follow,
that Christ had a true Body. This indeed is Theologicall ar∣guing,
by a true <HI>Signe</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> of Christ to confute the <HI>He∣retikes,</HI>
that denyed the <HI>Truth of Christ's Body.</HI> Which con∣trolleth

<P><PB N="213" REF="125"/>
A second Truth and Realty in this Sacrament is called <HI>Veritas
Revelationis,</HI> as it is a Signe, in respect of the <HI>Typical Signs</HI> of the
same <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ, in the Rites of the old Testament;
yet not absolutely in respect of the matter it selfe, but of the ma∣ner,
because the faithfull under the Law had the same faith in
Christ: and therfore their Sacraments had Relation to the same
<HI>Body,</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ, but in a difference of maner. For
as <HI>two Cherubins</HI> looked on the same <HI>Mercy-Seate,</HI> but with dif∣ferent
faces oppositely: so did both Testaments point out the
<MILESTONE N="10"/> same Passion of Christ in his Body, but with divers aspects.
For the Rites of the old Testament were, as<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Augustin. con∣tra Fauslum, lib.</HI> 19. <HI>pag.</HI> 349. <HI>Tom.</HI> 6.

the <HI>Truth of History</HI> is held to be more reall than the <HI>Truth

of that, which was promised: So the <HI>Evangelicall Sacrament</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/> may bee sayd to containe in it a more reall verity, than the <HI>Le∣viticall.</HI>
Therefore are the Rites of the old Law called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Heb. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Sha∣dowes,</HI>
in respect of the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of the Gospell; according
to the which difference Saint <HI>Iohn the Baptist</HI> was called by
Christ a <HI>Prophet,</HI> in that he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1. 15.</NOTE> fore-told Christ as now <HI>to come:</HI>
but hee was called <HI>more than a Prophet,</HI> as demonstrating and
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ibid. 19.</NOTE> pointing him out to <HI>bee now come.</HI> Which Contemplation oc∣casioned
divers Fathers to speake so <HI>Hyperbolically</HI> of the Sacra∣ment

<MILESTONE N="30"/><HI>old Testament,</HI> as if the Truth were in these, and not in them, as

<P>Besides the former two, there is <HI>Veritas Obsignationis,</HI> a <HI>Truth
sealed,</HI> which maketh this Sacrament more than a <HI>Signe,</HI> even
a <HI>Seale</HI> of Gods promises in Christ; for so the Apostle called
<HI>Circumcision,</HI> (albeit a Sacrament of the old Law) the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rom. 4. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Seale
of Faith.</HI> But yet the print of that Seale was but dimme, in

are called by other ancient Fathers (as well as by<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>August. Tom.</HI> 4. <HI>de Catechizand. ru∣dib. cap.</HI> 26. Signacu∣la esse visibilia rerum divinarum.</NOTE> Saint

which inferreth a greater degree of reall Truth, thereby re∣presented

them irreligious in so calling it? but why? onely because it is
a signe of Christ crucified. Notwithstanding, were the <HI>Cru∣cifix</HI>
as glorious as either Art could fashion, or Devotion affect,

And therefore how infinitely more honourable in all Christian
estimation must a <HI>Sacramentall Signe</HI> be, which onely the God
of Heaven and Earth could institute, and Christ hath ordained
to his Church, farre exceeding the property of a <HI>bare signe,</HI>
as you have heard? A Father delivering by politike assurances

such like have beene your Calumnies, and opprobrious Reproa∣ches

Issued out of Christ's Body visibly in

<P><MILESTONE N="40"/> Of this First kinde, you have heard the Romish Stories, in

<DIV5 TYPE="confutation">
<HEAD>CHALLENGE.</HEAD>
<P>AN answer you have heard from your Cardinall, unworthy
any man of Iudgement, because of a Triple falsity there∣in.
First in the Antecedent, and Assertion, saying that <HI>Being
in a Place or space is not inseparable from a Body.</HI> Secondly, in the
Ground of that, <HI>because Place is not of the Essence of a Body.</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
Thirdly, in his Instances, which hee insisteth upon (for Ex∣ample-sake)
which are both <HI>Heterogenies.</HI> Contrary to this
Assertion, wee have already proved the necessity of the <HI>Locall
Being of a Body,</HI> wheresoever it is; and now wee confirme it,
by the Assertion of One, than whom the latter Age of the
World hath not acknowledged any more accurate, and accom∣plished
with Philosophicall learning; even<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Si dicas, corpus est hîc, &amp; ibi idem, ipsum quidem distra∣has in diversa: prin∣cipio ptimo per se, &amp; immediato prohibe∣tur corpus esse in plu∣ribus ubi: est autem continuitas affectus consequens immedi∣ate unitatem; Con∣tradictiones enim sunt. <HI>Iulius Scalliger Exercit.</HI> 5. <HI>quaest.</HI> 6. [<HI>For how can there hee.</HI> Continuity <HI>in that</HI> 5. <HI>the</HI> Termi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i <HI>whereof are separa¦ted by divers places?</HI>]</NOTE> <HI>Iulius Scaliger</HI>
by name, (a Professed Romanist) who hath concluded, as a
Principle infallible, that <HI>Continuity being an immediate affection
and property of Vnity, One Body cannot be said to be in two places,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
as here, and there, without dividing it selfe from it selfe.</HI> So hee.
Certainly, because <HI>Place</HI> being the <HI>Terminus</HI> (to wit that, which
doth confine the <HI>Body</HI> that is in it) it is no more possible for the
Body to be in many places at once, than it is for an <HI>Vnity</HI> to
be a multitude, or many. Which truth, if that you should
need any further proofe, may seeme to be confirmed in this,
that your Disputers are driven to so miserable Straits, as that
<PB N="237" REF="137"/>
they are not able to instance in any one thing in the world to
exemplifie a Possibility of the being of a Body in divers
places at once, but onely <HI>Man's soule,</HI> which is a spirit; and
God himselfe, the Spirit of Spirits, of both which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See below Ch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. §. 2. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> §. 2.</NOTE> hereaf∣ter.
Onely you are to observe, that the Cardinals Argument,
in proving <HI>Space to be separable from a Body,</HI> because it is not of
the <HI>Essence of a Body,</HI> is, in it selfe, a <HI>Non sequitur,</HI> as may ap∣peare
in the Adjunct of <HI>Time:</HI> which although it be not of the
Essence of any thing, yet is it impossible for any thing to be
<MILESTONE N="10"/> without Time, or yet to be in two different Times together.</P>
<P>{fleur-de-lys}And for the better discovery of the weakenesse of
this their common Objection, Wee adde, that although
[<HI>Vbi,] Place,</HI> or <HI>Space</HI> be not of the essence of a Body, to
constitute it one, yet may it be sufficient to demonstrate it to
be but one Body, because of Contradiction; as well as all
proper <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or properties, as <HI>Risibility</HI> in a man; or else as
<HI>Quantity</HI> to a <HI>Body,</HI> and <HI>Circumscription</HI> to <HI>Quantity;</HI> which
although they be after their <HI>Substances</HI> in nature, yet are
they joyntly and inseparably with them in Times. But that
<MILESTONE N="20"/> wee may argue from the very termes of Contradiction.
Your asserting the same <HI>Body of Christ</HI> to be <HI>Locall,</HI> according
to the dimensions of <HI>Place;</HI> and <HI>not Locall,</HI> according to the
dimensions of <HI>Place,</HI> at one time, implies a Contradiction. But
you teach the same <HI>Body of Christ</HI> to be at once (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n heaven)
<HI>Locall,</HI> according to the dimensions of <HI>Place;</HI> and (as on the
Altar) not <HI>Locall,</HI> according to the dimensions of <HI>Place.</HI> Ther∣fore
is your Romish Doctrine Contradictorie to it selfe. Yet
shall wee be content that you may call this a Sophisticall Ar∣gument,
except the Ancient Fathers shall establish the same
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Conclusion. For this present take unto you a Reason, as wee
think, Impregnable. Nothing can possibly be <HI>Extrà se, with∣out
it selfe;</HI> but for a <HI>Body,</HI> being <HI>heere,</HI> to be at the same
time separated from <HI>Heere,</HI> by a Space where it is not, as on
this <HI>Altar,</HI> and on the other <HI>Altar,</HI> and yet not to be in the
Space betweene, is to be without it selfe; and Consequently
divideth it selfe from it selfe; which no man will affirme, that
is not beside himselfe.</P>

<P>To the fourth, thus: The eyes of <HI>Saul</HI> beholding Christ in
Heaven might be as good witnesses of Christ his Resurrection,
as were the eyes of <HI>Saint Stephen, Acts</HI> 7. who saw him; and so

Miracle a Body might not be in many places at once. This is
your onely Answer, and the Answer of every one of your An∣swerers,
whereat wee should wonder, but that they have given
us so often experience, what little conscience they make, how
true their Answers be, so that they may be knowne to have

<P>{fleur-de-lys}The Arguments, which wee receive from these Fathers,
in Confutation of your Romish Faith, of believing the same
<HI>Humane Body of Christ, Circumscribed in Heaven,</HI> and <HI>Vncir∣cumscribed <MILESTONE N="20"/>
on your Altars on Earth;</HI> are Two. The first is
their denying the <HI>Possibility</HI> of Christ's Body to be <HI>Vncir∣cumscribed,</HI>
and that upon two grounds: One, because <HI>Cir∣cumscription</HI>
is <HI>Essentiall,</HI> and as Proper to Christ's Body,
as <HI>Vncircumscription</HI> is Proper to his Divine Nature; with∣out
which Difference there should follow a Confusion of his
two Different natures, which was the very same <HI>Heresie</HI>
which they impugned. Their second ground is from the
infallible Rule of <HI>Contradiction,</HI> being the extremest De∣gree
of Impossibilitie that can be imagined; namely, For <MILESTONE N="30"/>
the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody to be, at the same time, <HI>mortall, and immor∣tall;
palpable, and impalpable.</HI> And yet your Fathers of the
<HI>Councell of Trent,</HI> in their wisedomes, have Canonized it
for an Article of your Faith, by teaching a <HI>palpable, and Cir∣cumscriptive
Body</HI> of Christ <HI>in Heaven,</HI> and <HI>impalpable, and Vn∣circumscriptive</HI>
on Earth. It might be held a kind of Impiety
not to consult with Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> in a Question of this

<P>{fleur-de-lys} And if you be not yet sufficiently acquainted with

good Christian, and saying<NOTE N="18" PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrysost. ad pop. Antioch. Hom.</HI> 55 Manduca me, &amp; te sursum haben, &amp; de∣orsum tibi conne∣ctor.</NOTE> <HI>Eate thou mee, I have

hee. Do you understand those words, as you did his <MILESTONE N="10"/>
former Speeches, literally? then must you as necessarily
conclude from hence, that the Christian Communicant,
<HI>Eating Christ's Body</HI> here on earth, is corporally present with
Christ in Heaven. But do you grant it to be figuratively
meant? then must you confesse, that the <HI>Conjunction,</HI>
spoken of by <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> is not Corporall, but a Spi∣rituall,
and a Mysticall <HI>Communication.</HI> So then <HI>Chrysostome,</HI>
speaking of a Sacrament, used a Sacramentall style, to call
the Sacrament of Christ's Body, <HI>the Body or flesh of Christ;</HI>
even as Christ (according to the Interpretation of Anci∣ent <MILESTONE N="20"/>
Fathers) called <HI>Bread</HI> his <HI>Body,</HI> as being a <HI>Signe</HI> and
<HI>Sacrament of his Body,</HI> after the usall terme of Scripture
in other Sacraments also. (All which have beene large∣ly
showne throughout the Second Booke). No marvell
therefore, if, granting that Christ taking his Flesh Per∣sonally
with him into Heaven, which hee left <HI>Sacramen∣tally</HI>
heere on Earth; you deny, notwithstanding, that
<HI>Elias,</HI> by leaving his <HI>Mantle,</HI> left not himselfe, because
his <HI>Mantle</HI> was not a Sacrament of himselfe. {fleur-de-lys}</P>
<P>As for the next Testimonie, it is no more than which eve∣ry <MILESTONE N="30"/>

<P>BVt the <HI>Doctor</HI> was answered, that the Example is many <MILESTONE N="40"/>

is of the <HI>Presence of the same Body in divers places at once.</HI> Wee
say, <HI>the same Body;</HI> but this your Example of <HI>Word,</HI> or <HI>Voice,</HI>
which you Both call the <HI>same,</HI> is not individually the same in
every mans hearing, as is here affirmed; but onely the same
in kinde, by a multiplication of the sounds, and words uttered,
<PB N="259" REF="148"/>
as <HI>Philosophy</HI> teacheth. Like as wee see in throwing a stone in∣to
the water, it maketh at the first a Circle, and circle multipli∣eth
upon circle, till the last come to a large Circumference:
Even so the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Verbum, quasi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aërem verberans. <HI>Ci∣cero.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Word,</HI> by <HI>Voyce breaking th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ayre,</HI> doth make in
the Ayre Circle upon circle, till a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound come to the eares of
the hearers; every of the parts of the Circle being articulated,
through the multiplication of the first forme, from the severall
emanations of the Rayes, the divers eares do no more receive the
same individuall Voyce, than they do the same individuall Ayre,
whereby the Voyce is conveyed. So that this Example is no
<MILESTONE N="10"/> more, in effect, than to prove the <HI>same Body in divers places
at once,</HI> by the sound of a <HI>word in many mens eares;</HI> which
is not individually the same, and serveth for nothing rather than
to make the Disputer ridiculous.</P>
<P>Thus was that <HI>Doctor</HI> answered, when hee confessed of the
<HI>voice of the Preacher in the Pulpit,</HI> which is received by multi∣tudes
of Hearers, and of his other Example of a <HI>colour of a red
Cow,</HI> by multiplication of it's formes seene of thousand men's

<MILESTONE N="20"/> you must grant, whether you will or no: because if (as your

else but Ayre moved;</HI> then seeing the Ayre, which entreth in∣to
one mans eare, is not the same with that which is received
into another man's eare; the voice which is an Articulate
impression of the Ayre, can be said to be no more the same,
than are the eares of the Hearers. Which is furthermore
demonstrable in this, that the voice is more and lesse percei∣ved
of men, according to their distances in place from the
Speaker, some hearing it more, and some lesse, some in whole,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> and some in part. But more and lesse cannot accord to one

your supposed <HI>Bodily Presence in two places at once;</HI> one
is in <HI>mans Soule,</HI> the other in <HI>God</HI> himselfe. First, wee will
enquire into the nature of the soule. Our exception against
a Bodies Being in divers places at once, is by reason of the
distance betweene place and place, for it is farre lesse than <MILESTONE N="20"/>
imaginable that one <HI>Body</HI> should in one and the same moment
be at <HI>Toledo</HI> in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and at <HI>Paris</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and yet not
to be in the intermediate Space betweene both, which divi∣deth
<HI>Toledo</HI> from <HI>Paris.</HI> But the Condition of the humane
Soule is utterly different, for it is in the Bodily members, not
as a <HI>Body</HI> in divers places, but as a <HI>forme</HI> in its owne matter,
being virtually and operatively in each part, nor having Quan∣tity
and extension, (the unseperable properties of a Body) but
by a formall perfection, <HI>As containing the Body, and not contai∣ned
thereof,</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Anima est in corpore, ut continens, non ut contenta. <HI>A∣quin.</HI> 1. <HI>qu.</HI> 52. <HI>Art.</HI> 1.</NOTE> saith your <HI>Aquinas.</HI> For the Soule is so in <MILESTONE N="30"/>
the head and foot, that it is aswell in the parts and members
betweene both; and therefore, not being possibly severed
from them, cannot be said to be divided from it selfe. Inso∣much,
that if any member of the Body (as for example the
hand) should be cut off, and divided from the Body, the Soule
being indivisible ceaseth to be therein. So utterly dissonant is
the <HI>Soules Being</HI> in divers places. Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> will tell
you (in the VIII Chapter following, Section 6.) that there is, in
this respect, a <HI>Greater difference betweene a Soule and a Body.</HI> And

<P>Nay, and your Cardinall having<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above Ch. 3. Sect. 3.</NOTE> confessed already, that <HI>It is

in every intermediate space, betweene place and place, and
also in all places without them: this being the propertie of his
infinitenesse to containe all places, and not to be contained of
any. And therefore cannot this maner of Presence, without

at the same time in another, as <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> are; but a

<HEAD>CHALLENGE.</HEAD>
<P>THis your owne Reason may wee justly retort upon your
selves, proving, that if the naturall disposition of the <HI>Body</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>of Christ</HI> be thus <HI>proportionably extended in it selfe,</HI> it must be
so likewise <HI>in respect of Place and Space;</HI> because the three di∣mensions
of the Body of Christ (as you have confessed) stand
thus, that one is an extension in <HI>Length,</HI> another in <HI>Breadth,</HI> the
third in <HI>Depth,</HI> and each of these three are distinct one from
another. Well then, the Arme must be here, and thus farre lon∣ger
than the Foot, the Legge here, and thus farre thicker than
<PB N="273" REF="155"/>
the Finger, the Hand here, and thus farre broader than the Toe,

Here and There, thus farre and so farre, being <HI>Relatives</HI>
of <HI>Space,</HI> and <HI>Place,</HI> do demonstratively shew that that <HI>Exten∣sion
of distinct parts</HI> of the Body, which they have in them∣selves
divisibly, the same they must necessarily have in respect
of the <HI>Vbi, Place,</HI> or <HI>Space,</HI> wherein the Body is. If therefore
you will not <HI>Heretically</HI> teach a <HI>Mathematicall,</HI> or <HI>Phantasticall
Body</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ, you must deny the <HI>Article of Trent,</HI> untill you
can beleeve, and make good, that a part of a divisible Body, lon∣ger
<MILESTONE N="10"/> or shorter, broader or narrower, can be (and that equally) in
one indivisible point.</P>
<P>This is confirmed by the Essence of Christ his <HI>glorified Body,</HI>
(as you confesse it to be) now in Heaven, possessing a Reall
place in the sayd proportion of Spaces of length, and breadth,
as it had here upon earth, which it doth by the naturall <HI>Mag∣nitude,</HI>
or <HI>Quantity</HI> thereof. But the sayd naturall Magni∣tude,
or quantity of the sayd Body of Christ is (according to
your wone generall Doctrine) in this Sacrament. Therefore
must it have the same Commensuration of Space, although not
<MILESTONE N="20"/> of the same Space which is one earth.</P>
<P>Wee should be loath to trouble your wits with these specu∣lations,
if that the necessity of the Cause (by reason of the Ab∣surdities,
of your Romish profession) did not inforce us hereun∣to;
Therefore must you suffer us a little to sport at your trifling
seriousnesse, who writing of this Divine Sacrament, and seeing

so is it as possible to him, by his Omnipotent power of Grace to

<P>Our Answer is Three-fold. I. That your Doctors could ne∣ver

<HI>Popes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Legat qai ve∣lit nostri Roberti Coci Censuram Scriptorum.</NOTE> <HI>Decret all Epistles</HI> to have beene truly theirs, whereof <MILESTONE N="10"/>
many of themselves have doubted, and which some al∣so
have denyed. II. That the Comparison fighteth main∣ly
against your professed Romane Faith in this very point,
which you contend for. For you teach <HI>Body of Christ to
be whole in the whole, and in every the least imaginable part of
the Hoast,</HI> without all maner of situation therein, so, as not
having the Head above, and the Feete below. This you
cannot deny to be your owne positive <HI>Tridentine</HI> Sense. But
the <HI>Manna,</HI> which was diminished and augmented in Quan∣tity
by Gods providence, had notwithstanding a certaine <MILESTONE N="20"/>
determinate Quantitie, expressely mentioned in the same
Text: <HI>Every man a Gomer, according to their families</HI>
namely every one an equall, but yet a severall measure and
Quantity; for one mans <HI>Manna</HI> was not the same which
another had. This agreeth not with your <HI>Corporall</HI> eating of
one, and the same <HI>Body of Christ.</HI> Next, the Granes of the
same <HI>Manna</HI> (for <HI>it was like Coriander-seed)</HI> had their seve∣rall
situations and distinct places in every <HI>Gomer,</HI> some lying
above, and some below, some on the right side, and some
on the left side of the <HI>Measure;</HI> which differences you abso∣lutely <MILESTONE N="30"/>
deny to accord with the maner of Christs being in
this Sacrament. III. The Comparison will farre better suite
with the Spirituall soules receiving of the Body of Christ:
Every Faithfull one indeed participating the same <HI>whole

<HEAD>Our Reply, displaying the Absurditie of Master Fishers Sup∣position
in respect of Impossibilities, by the Generall Do∣ctrine
of Fathers, Consent of Romish Divines,
and by his owne particular
Praevarication.<MILESTONE N="20"/></HEAD>
<P>First the Ancient Fathers, of the Primitive age, have una∣nimously
professed a Doctrine of an Absolute <HI>Impossibility</HI>
in all such things <HI>which imply any Contradiction,</HI> as you have
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above in this B. 4. cap. 3. Sect. 2. &amp; 3.</NOTE> heard; and maintaining this Doctrine of granting an Impos∣sibilitie
in such Cases to be a <HI>Truth greatly magnifying the
Omnipotencie and Almighty power of God; even by reason of
Contradiction in them,</HI> which is an affirming and denying of
the same thing. Concluding furthermore that gain-saying of
<HI>Impossibilitie,</HI> in things contradictory, hath beene anciently <MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>The Sanctuary of Heretikes.</HI> So the holy Fathers.</P>
<P>Secondly, all the Doctors of the Romish Schooles, of
whatsoever Age, Sect, Society, or Denomination, have sub∣scribed
to the judgement of those Ancient Fathers, in the
same point of <HI>Impossibilitie,</HI> but why Impossibility? Because,
say they, that such things are <HI>unconceivible in mans reason,</HI>
and that they seeme <HI>Absurd, because of Contradiction.</HI> And
hereupon have concluded of many <HI>Impossibilities</HI> touching a
<HI>Body:</HI> as for example,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above c. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Impossible for a Body to be produced in
divers places at once: Impossible for a quantitie of a Bodie not</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>to possesse a place: Impossible for Christs Body, as in this Sacra∣ment,
to goe from one place to another: Impossible for the same
Bodie to be equall with a greater quantity:</HI> and many other
more Impossibilities have they reckoned upon the same
ground, that the <HI>Reason of man</HI> could apprehend nothing in
such points but an implication of <HI>Contradiction.</HI> And now all
these great pillars of Christianity, as well in the Vniversall
<PB N="293" REF="165"/>
Church, Primitive, as in the now Romish, must, by Master
<HI>Fishers</HI> former Assertion, be held to have beene no better
than underminers of the Christian Faith, in that they did not
<HI>Rather beleeve those things to be possible,</HI> even because they see∣med

hee will be found so implicated within the hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of a

<HI>Christ's Body;</HI> as if Christ had sayd <HI>[This my Body is my

an <HI>Exposition very absurd in Tautologie.</HI> And if the same
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>[This]</HI> should betoken a Third thing, named an <HI>Individuum

<HI>full of Absurdities.</HI> And lastly, if it shall be sayd to

<P><MILESTONE N="30"/> And were it that Christ's Speech <HI>[This is my Body]</HI> were
taken <HI>properly,</HI> yet the Doctrine of <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> which
you doe erect upon this foundation, would prove to be truly

Romish Doctors themselves, who are, in their patronizing
of your Article of <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> distracted into two
contrary Opinions; some saying that the <HI>Change,</HI> called
<HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> is made by <HI>Production of Christ's Body out

of Change as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above, Booke 3. Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. §. 1.</NOTE> Absurd, as to affirme <HI>Christ's Body to have</HI>

should be scandalized, and the other mocked. This supposed,<MILESTONE N="20"/>

</DIV5>
<DIV5 TYPE="confutation">
<HEAD>Our Reply, noting a double Errour in
M<SUP>r</SUP>. Fisher's Reason.</HEAD>
<P>His first Error is, that hee supposeth that <HI>The Primitive
Church</HI> did absolutely conceale the <HI>Eucharist from Pagans and
Catechumenists,</HI> and that more precisely than any other My∣steries;
each of which are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Booke 7. cap. 3.</NOTE> proved to be false. For neither
could the <HI>Mystery of the Eucharist</HI> be sayd to have beene <MILESTONE N="30"/>
wholly <HI>concealed,</HI> which the Fathers both preached in their
Sermons, and expressed in their publike Writings (as is to be
seene in the Bookes of <HI>Iustine, Cyprian,</HI> and other Fathers:)
nor yet can it be truly affirmed that they more precisely kept
secret this Sacrament than the other <HI>Mysteries,</HI> seeing the
same Primitive Fathers professed as strictly, that <HI>They durst
not reveale the Sacrament of Baptisme either to Pagans or Ca∣techumenists,</HI>
as they did the Sacrament of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> as
will be proved at large in the Seventh Booke.</P>
<P>His Second Absurdity is to be seene in his Comparison <MILESTONE N="40"/>
(common to him with his fellowes) reasoning thus, that the
Articles of the <HI>Trinity</HI> and of the <HI>Incarnation</HI> of Christ, are
above mans Capacity and <HI>Reason,</HI> being onely to be appre∣hended
by Faith, and therefore ought men to inthrall their
Reason to believe what the Romish Church teacheth, con∣cerning
the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> and not examine their Mysteries of
<HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> which implyeth an Absolute <HI>Absence</HI> (in
<PB N="397" REF="167"/>
this Sacrament) of the <HI>Substance of Bread,</HI> and an Existence
of the Naturall <HI>Body of Christ.</HI> Whereas, indeed, there can∣not
bee a more absurd Comparison; because the Mystery
of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and maner of Hypostaticall Vnion of the
<HI>God-head and Man-hood of Christ,</HI> are Objects transcendently
spirituall, and matters of Infinitenesse in themselves: but
the matters of all Sacraments, are Corporall Objects of

<P><MILESTONE N="10"/> FIve Points are chiefly observable in this <HI>Canon.</HI> First is the

not too <HI>intent unto,</HI> they call <HI>Bread after Consecration;</HI> for the
<HI>Errour,</HI> which they would have avoyded, was either the too
much abasing of this Sacrament (according to your Cardinals

<MILESTONE N="20"/> not to have perswaded any to have too meane an estimation of
the <HI>Bread unconsecrated;</HI> (w<SUP>ch</SUP> you your selves hold to be a com∣mon
and prophane thing:) or else the <HI>Errour</HI> must have been, as
indeed it was, too high a valuation of the outward <HI>Element of
Bread,</HI> which must needs be so, because it was Consecrated, and
notwithstanding it being so Consecrated, in the <HI>Canon</HI> it is called
<HI>Bread.</HI> Which your Fathers of the <HI>Councel of Trent</HI> would not
have indured, especially seeing that wee find that your<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nic. Cabas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣las.</HI> Latini dicunt eos, qui panem &amp; vinum nominant, &amp; tan∣quam nondum san∣ctificatis precantur sanctificationem post illa verba [Hoc est Corpus meum,] rem supervacuam facere. <HI>Expos.

<MILESTONE N="30"/> and <HI>Wine,</HI> as they name them <HI>Symbols</HI> and <HI>Signes,</HI> which proper∣ly
they could not be, untill <HI>after Consecration.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Conc. Ni∣cen.</NOTE> <HI>Canon</HI> expresly noteth and distinguisheth
two <HI>Tables,</HI> in respect of place; the one, as <HI>Here;</HI> being as much
as to say, <HI>The Table:</HI> and the other opposed hereunto is instiled,
<HI>That Table,</HI> I say. And now be it knowne, that <HI>[The Table here]</HI>
which is not to be represented by the Antithesis of <HI>[But that

<HI>There,</HI> doe prove two distinct Places: except one can make
<MILESTONE N="40"/> congruitie of these words <HI>[That Table Here.]</HI> Which I note, in
Confutation of a vaine and crotchetive Objector. And, of this
Table <HI>Here,</HI> the Councel forbiddeth Christians to looke <HI>Too
attentively to the thing set before us:</HI> But contrarily, concer∣ning
<HI>That</HI> other <HI>Table,</HI> they command men to <HI>Lift up their
minds aloft.</HI> And not thus only, but they also distinguish them,
in respect of their different Objects. The Object of the First
<PB N="304" REF="171" MS="y"/>
<HI>Table, Here,</HI> they name <HI>Bread,</HI> and the <HI>Cup,</HI> the Objects of

other Table, expressed to be the <HI>Lambe God,</HI> the Object of our
mindes.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the <HI>Admonition</HI> or <HI>Caution,</HI> which the <HI>Councel</HI> giveth
concerning the <HI>Bread,</HI> is, <HI>not to be too intent to it:</HI> but touching
the <HI>Lambe Christ,</HI> they command us to <HI>lift up our mindes aloft;</HI>
for so the world<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] doth signifie; not to be used (wee

<HEAD>The next two Proofes out of the same Canon of Nice, to
manifest our Protestant profession touching the
Question in hand.
SECT. V.</HEAD>
<P>OVr next two Proofes out of the <HI>Canon</HI> are these. First is
their Reason of the former Caution: The Second, the <MILESTONE N="20"/>
Confirmation of that Reason: Both are expresly set downe in
the <HI>Canon</HI> it selfe. Why then did those holy Fathers admonish
us, <HI>not to be too intent to the Bread and Wine set before us?</HI> It fol∣loweth;
<HI>Because they are not ordained to satisfie our Naturall man,</HI>
namely, by a full <HI>Eating and Drinking:</HI> but for a Sacramentall
participation of the <HI>Body, and Blood of Christ,</HI> to the <HI>sanctify∣ing
of our Soules:</HI> whereas your Church doth attribute to that,
which you eat in this Sacrament, a power of <HI>sanctifying the Bo∣dy
by it's Bodily touch.</HI> But much more will the next Proofe un∣dermine
your Defence.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>
<P>To confirme their Reason, why the Sacrament was not
ordayned for the satisfying of <HI>the naturall man,</HI> they adde
saying; <HI>For this canse wee receive not much, but little.</HI>
Which one Clause most evidently proveth it to be spoken of
<HI>Bread and Wine;</HI> and not of the <HI>Body, and Blood of Christ:</HI>
as your generall <HI>Romane</HI> Catechisme (if you have not already
learned it) will now teach you to believe, saying that<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg"><HI>Catechis. Rom.</HI> Christum Dominum esse in hoc Scramen∣to
non dicimus, ut parvus aut magnus est, sed ut substantia est. <HI>Tract. de Eucha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. num. 36.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Christ
is not great or small in this Sacrament.</HI> And indeed none ever said
of the Eucharist, that hee ate a little of <HI>Christ Body,</HI> or a <HI>little
Christ;</HI> but yet the Sacrament eaten is sometimes more, some∣time <MILESTONE N="40"/>
lesse Nor this onely, but the <HI>Canon</HI> furthermore speaketh
of taking <HI>a little</HI> of that, <HI>whereof if much were taken</HI> (saith it) <HI>it
might satiate the naturall man.</HI> So the <HI>Canon.</HI> But that the out∣ward
Sacrament can truely <HI>satisfie the naturall man,</HI> you your
selves will testifie in your <HI>Booke-Cases</HI> and <HI>Missals,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Book, 3. chap. 3. §. 10. Chap 6. §. 1. &amp; 2.</NOTE> acknow∣ledging
men <HI>Drunke</HI> with the Sacrament, even unto <HI>vomiting</HI>
with the one part thereof, and also making mention of <HI>Men,</HI> and
<PB N="305" REF="171"/>
<HI>Mice</HI> being <HI>fed</HI> and <HI>nourished</HI> with the other. So then the <HI>natu∣turall
man</HI> may be <HI>satiated</HI> with this Sacrament; but with what
therein? <HI>The Body and Blood of Christ?</HI> you abhorre to thinke
that, with <HI>Accidents?</HI> You may be ashamed to affirme it, as
from the J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgement of Antiquity, seeing you were never able
hitherto justly to produce one Father for proofe of the Exi∣stence
of <HI>Accidents</HI> without their <HI>Subjects:</HI> or of nourishing a
<HI>Substance</HI> by meere <HI>Accidents.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore untill you can prove some one of all these, give us
<MILESTONE N="10"/> leave to beleeve, that all were of the mind of that one<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Gregor. Nyssen. <HI>Quomodò enim res incorporea corpori cibus fiat?</HI> In Orat. de vita Mosi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 509.</NOTE> Fa∣ther,
who held it <HI>Impossible for an Incorporeall, or not-Bodily
thing to be food to a Bodily substance.</HI> And so much the rather, be∣cause
the Fathers have manifoldly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above, Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 7. &amp; 10. &amp;c.</NOTE> acknowledged in this Sa∣crament,
<HI>after Consecration, the substance of Bread.</HI> Wherefore
the Reasoning of the <HI>Councel,</HI> touching the Eucharist, was like as
if one should say of Baptisme; <HI>Wee take not too much, but little,
lest it might be thought to have beene ordained not for a Sacramen∣tall
meanes of sanctifying the Soule, but for the clensing of the
Flesh.</HI> None is so stupid as not to understand, by <HI>Much</HI> and
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>Little,</HI> the <HI>substance of water;</HI> and not onely the Accidents
thereof.</P>
<P>And if you shall need a further Explication of the same sen∣tence
of the Fathers of <HI>Nice</HI> you may fetch it from the Fathers
in another <HI>Councel</HI> held at <HI>Toledo</HI> in Spaine, <HI>Anno 693.</HI> who
shew this Reason, why they<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg"><HI>Conc. Tolet 16 Anno 693 Can 6.</HI> In∣tegrum panem esse sumendum—ne{que} grande aliquid, sed modica tantum ob∣lata, secundum id quod Ecclesiastica consuetudo retentat: cujus reliquiae aut ad conservandum mo∣dico loculo absque aliqua injuria Sacri∣ficijs confecrotur; aut si sumendum fuerit necessarium, non ventrem illius, qui sumpserit, gravis far∣ciminis onere pre∣mat, nec quid indi∣gesticè vadat, sed ani∣mum alimoniâ spiri∣tuali resiciat.</NOTE> <HI>Take little portions of the Hoast,</HI>
(namely say they) <HI>lest otherwise the belly of him that taketh this
Sacrament may be stuffed, and over charged, and lest it may passe
into the Draught, but that it may be nourishment for the Soule.</HI>
Hereby plainly teaching, concerning the consecrated matter,
<MILESTONE N="30"/> that were it so much as could burthen the belly, it would
through the supersluity thereof goe into the <HI>Draught:</HI> whereas,
if <HI>Lesse,</HI> it would serve as wel, or better for a Sacramentall use, to
the replenishing of our soules in the spiritually receiving of the
<HI>Body of Christ.</HI> But never was any of the Primitive Age so farre
bereft of his wits as to imagine that <HI>Much,</HI> which stuffeth, and
after passeth into the <HI>Draught,</HI> to be <HI>Christ's Bodie:</HI> and you
may sweare that the Fathers meant not meere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above Book 3. Chap. 3 §. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Accidents;</HI>
For meere <HI>Accidents</HI> have not the property of <HI>Substance,</HI>
through the <HI>Muchnesse</HI> thereof, either to <HI>satiate the naturall ap∣petite,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/> in feeding, or to <HI>overcharge the belly by weight,</HI> in pros∣sing
it downe to the <HI>Draught.</HI> Never did any Father father
such an Imagination. What can be, if this be not true reaso∣ning,
and consequently a full confutation of your <HI>Romane</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>Therefore this one <HI>Canon of Nice</HI> being thus undoubtedly
gained, concerning he not seeking <HI>Christ, Here, on this Table,</HI> is
sufficient of it selfe to batter downe your Assertion by a five∣fold
force. First, by proofe of no <HI>Transubstantiation of Bread;</HI>
<PB N="306" REF="172"/>
Secondly, no <HI>Corporall Presence of Christs Body;</HI> Thirdly, no

Flesh or drinke his Blood.</HI> Wee reserve <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> for
a peculiar Section, and our reason is, because your Dispu∣ters
do so earnestly struggle to draw him to your part; but
yet most vainely and unconscionably, as will appeare in the
Section following.</P>
<P>Now whether side, yours, or ours, can more satisfactorily
reconcile the seeming Contradictions of the Fathers, in say∣ing
and gain-saying the <HI>Eating</HI> of Christs Flesh by the <HI>Wick∣ed,</HI>
it will stand with equity and good Conscience, that
they may carry the Cause. Your All-answer, and the An∣swer <MILESTONE N="10"/>
of you All, is by Distinction, saying, that <HI>The wicked
eate the Body of Christ Corporally in this Sacrament, by a Bodily
Touch; but they eate it not Spiritually: for they eate it not wor∣thly,
and in that respect are said not to eate it.</HI> So you. As
if the Fathers, in denying the <HI>Wicked</HI> to be partakers of
Christs Flesh, must have meant that they <HI>Eate it not wor∣thily.</HI>
But this Distinction cannot possibly accord with your
owne Romish Faith, which teacheth a <HI>Bodily Eating,</HI> with a
<HI>Bodily Touch</HI> by a <HI>Bodily. Vnion</HI> of the <HI>Eater with the Body of
Christ,</HI> common as well to <HI>Iudas,</HI> as to <HI>Peter;</HI> to the Pro∣phanest <MILESTONE N="20"/>
miscreant, as to the Godliest Saint: yea to the very
Beasts, as really as to Men.</P>
<P>If this had beene the ancient <HI>Catholike Faith,</HI> then could
not these Fathers so peremptorily and precisely have deny∣ed,
that any <HI>Wicked is joyned and united with Christs Body,</HI> and
especially when they mention in expresse termes a <HI>Naturall
and Corporall Conjunction of Christs Body with the Bodies of
the Communicants,</HI> by this Sacrament; which you your selves
interpret to be spoken of your <HI>Corporall Vnion by a Bodily
Touch;</HI> nor would <HI>Origen</HI> give this his absolute <HI>[Non posse,]</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>The Wicked cannot</HI> (saith he) <HI>be partakers of the flesh of Christ,</HI>
which is implyed in the Sayings of the rest of the Fathers,
when they speake so universally of the <HI>True Eater</HI> of Christs
Body,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above in this Sect. n. 11. &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>That every such are joyned with him to Immortality.</HI>
Whereof somewhat more hereafter.</P>
<P>But our Protestant Distinction, for reconciliation-sake,
is, that the Fathers, in affirming <HI>The Wicked to eat the Body of
Christ,</HI> spake onely <HI>Symbolically,</HI> to wit, as they called the
<HI>Sacrament</HI> of Christs Body, the <HI>Body of Christ, Sacramen∣tally</HI>
and <HI>Figuratively</HI> (as hath beene<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Booke 2. thorowout.</NOTE> copiously and convin∣cingly <MILESTONE N="40"/>
proved;) So do they affirme the Body of Christ to be
<HI>Eaten of the Wicked,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Symbolically,</HI> by eating
onely the Sacrament of his Body: But in affirming that the
<HI>Godly onely eat Christs flesh,</HI> they spake of the <HI>Spiritually-Real
Eating</HI> by Faith, which was the maner and meanes Spirituall
of being <HI>truly Vnited</HI> to Christs flesh, and so to his person,
God and man; and so, as his lively members, made Capa∣ble
<PB N="323" REF="181"/>
of <HI>Immortality</HI> it selfe, as well in Body, as in Soule.
This our Distinction, wee have received from <HI>Saint Augu∣stine,</HI>
for whom both you and wee strive, as for the <HI>Homer</HI> of
his age, and Patron of our Faith in this Point, which is to be
tryed in the Section following.</P>
<P>In the Interim, you (who so earnestly plead against this
privilege of the <HI>Godly</HI> to be partakers of Christs Body, by
making the <HI>Wicked</HI> to be as Capable thereof, as any Sancti∣fyed
member of Christ can be) thinke but with your selves,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> how that <HI>Satan</HI> is sayd to have <HI>entred</HI> into the heart of <HI>Iudas,</HI>
after his receiving of this Sacrament; and then tell us, if
the <HI>Wicked</HI> be really partakers of Christs Body, and not
to Contradict that Scripture, which denyeth that there can
be any <HI>Communion with Christ and Beliall;</HI> yet will you
inferre (in <HI>Iudas,)</HI> a Communion betweene <HI>Christ</HI> and
<HI>Satan.</HI></P>

<P>Those foresayd Prophane livers tooke to themselves this
presumption for their Pillow to leane and sleepe upon, in
indulging themselves in their wickednesse. <HI>Wee</HI> (say they)
<HI>do eat, no onely the Sacrament, but indeed wee eat Christs Body
it selfe, because wee are members of his mysticall Body. S. Au∣gustine</HI>
answereth directly, that Christ by saying <HI>[Hee that</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
<HI>eateth my flesh abideth in mee,]</HI> sheweth what it is to <HI>Eat</HI>
Christs Body <HI>[non Sacramento tenus]</HI> that is, <HI>Not onely as con∣cerning
the Sacrament,</HI> but <HI>[Indeed,]</HI> So hee. Where wee
have a flat opposition, betweene that which is called <HI>[Re∣vera]</HI>
a <HI>Reall eating,</HI> against <HI>Eating onely Sacramentally.</HI> So
that the Antithesis falling betweene these Termes, of Ea∣ting
Christs Body <HI>[Revera, Indeed]</HI> by the Godly; and of
Eating it onely <HI>[Sacramento tenus]</HI> as much as to say, <HI>Not
indeed,</HI> by the <HI>Wicked:</HI> It must necessarily follow, that the <MILESTONE N="30"/>
Wicked do <HI>not eat, Indeed, the Body of Christ;</HI> and Con∣sequently,
that there is <HI>[not Indeed]</HI> in this Sacrament, the
Corporall Presence of Christ, which your Profession tea∣cheth
to be <HI>Eaten</HI> as well of a <HI>Wicked man,</HI> or of vile <HI>Myce,</HI>
as it can be of the most Faithfull member of Christ. Againe
<HI>Saint Augustine</HI> once told us, <HI>That the Sacrament is called the
Body of Christ, not in the Truth of the thing, but in a Signifi∣cant
mystery,</HI> which your owne Romish Glosse expoundeth
to meane, that <HI>It is called Christs Body Improperly.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Assertion of <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> will accord to
our former Conclusion,<NOTE N="9" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.

(saith hee) <HI>although hee presse with his Teeth, the Sacrament
of Christs flesh; yet doth hee not Eat the Spirituall flesh of
Christ.</HI> The Observable is, that hee saith not, <HI>They eat not
Spiritually the flesh of Christ;</HI> But <HI>[They eat not the Spirituall
<PB N="325" REF="182"/>
flesh of Christ:]</HI> therefore called <HI>Spirituall,</HI> because it is
Hypostatically united unto his Deity. So then, that which
they properly <HI>Eat,</HI> is not <HI>Christ Body,</HI> but onely the Sacra∣ment
thereof: allowing no <HI>Corporall Touch</HI> with the <HI>Teeth,</HI>
but onely of the Sacrament it selfe. Compare wee now
this Doctrine of <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> of <HI>Pressing onely the Sa∣crament
of Christs Body,</HI> and not Christs Body it selfe; with
your <HI>Pope Nicholas</HI> his Profession of <HI>Tearing of Christs Body
with mens Teeth,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See below Ch. 5. Sect. 1.</NOTE> (above mentioned) and then will it be easie
<MILESTONE N="10"/> for any man of but ordinary Capacity to collect, that <HI>Pope
Nicholas,</HI> by his Affirmation, meant as directly to proclame
your Romish Article of the <HI>Corporall Presence</HI> of Christs
Body in the Sacrament; as <HI>S. Augustine,</HI> by his Denyall,
meant utterly to disclame and abandon it.</P>
<P>In the thire place, <HI>Saint Augustine,</HI> for your better instru∣ction,
and apprehension of his meaning, exemplifyeth it by
two notable Instances and Comparisons; the First, between
two different kinds of Communicants, at our Lords owne
Table, namely Christs faithfull <HI>Apostles,</HI> and the Reprobate
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>Iudas,</HI> saying,<NOTE N="10" PLACE="marg">Aug. Tract 59. in Ioh. Illi mandu∣carunt panem, Do∣minum; Iudas au∣tem panem Domini.</NOTE> <HI>They received the Bread, the Lord;</HI> (mea∣ning

is, that <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> spake so, because <HI>Iudas</HI> ate the

effects, <HI>Eating Profitably,</HI> and <HI>Not Profitably,</HI> which
you call <HI>Spiritually,</HI> and not <HI>Spiritually,</HI> which is the Evasion
of others: when as indeed the Comparision is expresly be∣tweene

<P>Your Doctor, to make <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> as flatly a Papist as <MILESTONE N="20"/>
himselfe, hath framed<NOTE N="12" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr Heskins in his parliament of Christ. Booke 3. c. 48. fol. 368. &amp; 369.</HI> The place of Saint Augustine presseth our Adversaries so strictly, that they have no refuge, Say∣ing, Manducaverunt multi qui Domino placuerunt, &amp; mortui non sunt; Quare? quia visibilem cibum spiritualiter intellex∣erunt—Nam &amp; hodie nos accipi∣mus visibilem cibum; [Scd aliud est Sacra∣mentum, aliud virtus Sacramenti, quam multi de Altari acci∣piunt &amp; mòriuntur. Note here <HI>(saith he)</HI> the Distinction that Saint Augustine ma∣keth betwixt the Sa∣crament, and the vir∣tue of the Sacra∣ment, Saying: that the Sacrament is one thing, and the virtue of the Sacrament another. Then of the virtue of the Sacrament, he saith, that many doe receive it at the Altar and do die. Meaning according to the Saying of the Apostle, that receiving, it unwor∣thily <MILESTONE N="40"/> they Die in the Soule, eating and drinking their owne Damnation. Now would it be learned of the Adversary, how hee will understand Saint Augustine in this word [Virtue.] First certaine it is, that it is not taken for the Sacramentall Bread: For, that is the other member of the Distinction. Then must it either be taken for the virtue of the Passion of Christ, or for the Body of Christ it selfe. For in the Sa∣crament be no more but these three to be received, The Sacrament, The Body of Christ, and the virtue of his Passion. It cannot be taken for the virtue of Christ's Passion, for that is not, nor cannot be Death and Damnation to the Receiver in the receiving, but Life and Salvation. This virtue that Saint Augustine speaketh of is such, that many do die in the receiving of it. It remaineth then, that by this virtue of the Sacrament, is understood the Body of Christ, which many by unworthy receiving do wickedly abuse, and so receiving kill their soules, and Die the Death that Iudas did.</NOTE> See the Margin) a false Allega∣tion,
by depraving the latter part of the Sentence of <HI>Saint
Augustine,</HI> alleging them thus: <HI>Nam &amp; multi hodie de Altari
accipimus cibum visibilem: [Sed aliud est Sacramentum, aliud Virtus Sacramenti? quam multi accipiunt &amp; moriuntur.]</HI> that
is, <HI>Many now rèceive from the Altar the visible meate; [But
the Sacrament is one thing, and the Virtue of the Sacrament ano∣ther
thing, which, many eating die.]</HI> And thereupon taking a
full Cariere in a large Discourse (See the margin) argueth <MILESTONE N="30"/>
thus. <HI>By the word [Virtue]</HI> (saith hee) <HI>is meant the Body of
Christ: And by [Dying] is meant the death of the Soule; But
Saint Augustine affirmeth that the Wicked do eate of this [Vir∣tue]
or Body of Christ.</HI> So hee; Point-blanke Contrary to
our Interpretation as can be, not but that wee confesse, that
<HI>Saint Augustine</HI> by this word, <HI>Virtue,</HI> meant the <HI>Body of Christ;</HI>
and that by <HI>Dying,</HI> is understood the <HI>Death of mens Soules;</HI>
but that his Assertion affirming <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> to teach here∣in
<HI>That the Wicked Receivers that Dye in their Soules, do eate
<PB N="327" REF="183"/>
the Virtue which is the Body of Christ;</HI> is a plaine Imposture
by a Grossely false Construction and Composition of <HI>Saint
Augustines</HI> words thus: <HI>[Aliud est virtus Sacramenti. Qudm
multi &amp;c.]</HI> wherein you see a full point, as a deepe Ditch,
to sever <HI>virtus</HI> from the immediatly following word, <HI>Quàm,</HI>
which your Doctor joyneth together, whereby the word,
<HI>Virtus,</HI> is Vitiously abused. Then is he injurious to <HI>Quàm,</HI> which being an Adverbe, and carrying the Adverbiall Ac∣cent
above-head, as a Badge of Distinction, hee notwith∣standing
<MILESTONE N="10"/> turneth into a Pronoune-adjective, <HI>Quam;</HI> And
thirdly, He wrongeth the Construction of them both, in
matching, as it were in marriage, a little<SUP>u</SUP> in <HI>Virtus,</HI> with
a great <HI>Q</HI> in <HI>Quàm,</HI> whereas every Grammarian, by all the
rules of <HI>Syntaxis,</HI> would forbid the Banes.</P>
<P>Wee know you (Romish Priests) to be reasonable men,
and will therefore demand; whether hee had not reason,
by some other Edition of <HI>Saint Augustine,</HI> to justifie his Al∣legation,
and thereby his owne Conclusion, as if <HI>Saint Au∣gustine</HI>
had meant, <HI>That the wicked do Dye in their Soule, by</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>unworthy Eating of the Reall Body of Christ?</HI> Wee answer, no:
It is Impossible hee should evade by any such excuse, and
lest wee may seeme to speake partially, wee shall offer un∣to
you a witnesse hereof, without all exception, and that shall
be the Author <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> himselfe, the Expositor of his
owne meaning in the very same Tractate, and in his words
a little after expresly concluding the Contrary, saying: that
<NOTE N="13" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. Tom. 9. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ioh. Tract. 26.</HI> Hic est panis qui de coelo descendit, ut si quis manducaverit ex ip∣so, non moriatur.

<MILESTONE N="30"/> that none that eate the <HI>Virtue,</HI> which is (as hath beene con∣fessed)
the <HI>Body of the Lord, dye the Death of the Soule.</HI> And
for better explanation, hee distinguisheth, affirming that
the <HI>Maner of Eating of the virtue of this Sacrament,</HI> is, <HI>Eating
it, [Intus corde, Inwardly in the heart:]</HI> and the Eating of

with a relation to a <HI>Sacramentall Eating</HI> with the mouth, as some <MILESTONE N="30"/>
of the Fathers thought; but yet onely Sacramentally, and not
Properly, as by them will be found true.</P>
<P><HI>Wee returne to the Discourse of your Romish Priest,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Above at (a)</NOTE> Christ
having spoken <HI>(saith hee)</HI> of Eating his Flesh, and the Capernàites
answering [How can hee give us his Flesh to eate?] They under∣stood
eating with the mouth, yet were (a speciall observation) ne∣ver
reproved of Christ for mistaking the meaning of his words,
a strong reason that they understood them rightly; but for not be∣leeving
them: and Christ often repeating the eating of his Flesh,
and drinking of his Blood, and requiring them to beleeve, and <MILESTONE N="40"/>
when hee saith [The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that
quickeneth] it is not spoken to exclude the Reall Presence, or to
qualifie his former sayings, but to admonish them not to judge things
by carnall reason, and yet more evidently in the words following
[There are some of you that beleeve not] Hee sayd not (saith Saint
Augustine) there be some among you that understand not: so plain∣ly
did hee hereby instruct them not how to understand, but how to
<PB N="329" REF="184"/>
beleeve; for had hee, for their better understanding, intended
hereby to have qualified, or corrected his former sayings, as to be
meant Eating Spiritually by Faith, hee would have explained him∣selfe
in plaine termes, and so have satisfied the Iewes. Vpon which
premises I do conclude, that because our Saviour did reprove
his Scrupulous hearers not for want of understanding, but for want
of beleefe, it doth from thence, and from other premises abun∣dantly
follow that his fore-sayd promise was not obscure, and Figu∣rative,
but plaine and literall for our receiving of him without our
<MILESTONE N="10"/> bodily mouthes.</P>
<P>Thus farre your celebrious Priest, namely so, as in almost all
other his Collections, not understanding the Truth of the mat∣ter.
His Inferences stand thus. First, Christ reprehended the
<HI>Capernaites,</HI> for not <HI>Beleeving</HI> his words concerning <HI>Eating his
Flesh:</HI> but not for <HI>not understanding them.</HI> Therefore it fol∣loweth
that they understood his words, of <HI>Eating his Flesh,
right well.</HI> Secondly, They understood his Speech: There∣fore
Christ, in saying, <HI>The Flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit
that quickeneth,</HI> did not thereby <HI>qualifie</HI> his former speech, to
<MILESTONE N="20"/> instruct their understanding: Thirdly, They needed no instru∣ction
of their understanding; Therefore Christs words of <HI>Eating
his Flesh, were not Figurative.</HI> Fourthly, these his words were
<HI>not Figurative:</HI> Therefore his words of <HI>Eating his Flesh,</HI> teach
a <HI>Corporall Presence</HI> thereof in the Sacrament.</P>
<P>Each of these Consequences are delivered as ignorantly;
as confidently. For common learning teacheth, that there is
a double consideration of <HI>Truth,</HI> in every True speech; the one
is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><HI>that it is True;</HI> the second is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><HI>what is the Truth,</HI> or
true sense thereof? To the apprehending of the first is requi∣red
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Beliefe, whereupon <HI>Aristotle</HI> gave that Rule to every
Schollar, that intendeth to learne the principles of any Art (to
wit) <HI>Oportet discentem credere: A Schollar is bound to beleeve.</HI>
The other point, touching the Truth, or true sense, <HI>what it is,</HI> is
the Object of mans understanding; so that there is a great dif∣ference
betweene both these in the case of a Reprehension. As
for example; the Master teaching the definition of <HI>Logick,</HI> say∣ing;
<HI>It is an Art of Disputing rightly,</HI> may justly reprove his
Schollar for his <HI>not beleeving</HI> it, because his <HI>not beleeving</HI> is
wilfull: so can hee not for his <HI>not understanding</HI> it, for that hee
<MILESTONE N="40"/> therefore learneth, because hee doth not understand; except
it be, that being taught hee either through carelesse negli∣gence,
or else affected ignorance will not understand.</P>
<P>This agreeth with the Current of Scripture <HI>Iohn 6. verse 38.</HI>
Christ being the Oracle of <HI>Truth, which descended from Hea∣ven
to reveale the will of his Father,</HI> might justly exact <HI>Beliefe,</HI>
that whatsoever hee spake to the sonnes of men was most true:
as it is written, <HI>The will of God is, that whosoever beleeveth in
<PB N="330" REF="185"/>
mee, &amp;c.</HI> verse 40. viz. <HI>That they must Eate his Flesh.</HI> But his
hearers could not understand <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><HI>What</HI> was the true sense of these
words, which caused them to say, <HI>This is an hard saying.</HI> There∣fore
(like Schollars of preposterous wits) would they not be∣leeve
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, namely <HI>That</HI> they were <HI>True:</HI> hence it was that Christ
reproved them for <HI>not beleeving</HI> onely verse 64. and not for
<HI>not understanding.</HI> Because it was as lawfull for Christs Dis∣ciples
to be ignorant of his darke sayings and Parables (which
were therefore so spoken, that his Schollars might more ear∣nestly
labour to know them) as it was after lawfull for them to <MILESTONE N="10"/>

in respect of your ordinary and proper maner of Eating, by a
visible dividing of Christs flesh into parts and morsells, and that
it be sod, and not raw. But Christs flesh in the Eucharist is re∣ceived
whole, invisibly, and without any hurt, by which maner
of Eating wee represent the Passion of Christ; which is thus
<MILESTONE N="10"/> proved: because First, It is no hainous sinne to eat Christs flesh

<P>Your Cardinall thinketh to evade, by multiplicity of
Distinctions. Ob. 1. <HI>Hee meant not Eating with Teeth, but a
passing of it from the Mouth into the Stomacke.</HI> Sol. This is
<MILESTONE N="20"/> False, because the Apostles in their receiving of it, did use
<HI>Chewing,</HI> your owne Jesuite <HI>Suarez</HI> confessing that the Sa∣cramentall
Bread in Christ's time was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Booke 1. cap. 2. §. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Glutinosus:</HI> And

many Ages in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as also used among some
of your Church at this day, as hath beene<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above Cap. 5. Sect. 4.</NOTE> proved. And
lastly that <HI>Saint Augustine</HI> himselfe meant Eating by <HI>Tearing
with Teeth,</HI> who (as the<NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellar lib. 1. de Euch. Cap. 7.</HI> Qui manducat corde, non qui premit dente, &amp;c. Vbi de Sacramento loquitur, non qui premit dente, nimi∣rùm, solo.</NOTE> Cardinall himselfe confesseth)

Eating requireth a Proper Tearing,</HI> even as your Cardinall
himselfe, calling <HI>Eating, by Dividing into Parts, a Proper ma∣ner
of Eating.</HI> Ob. 3. <HI>Augustine spoke of a visible Eating of
Christ, and not as ours is, Invisible.</HI> Sol. As if a blinde man
could not eat meat as perfectly as he that seeth. Ob. 4. But
<MILESTONE N="40"/><HI>Saint Augustine understood Christs flesh Sod, and not Raw.</HI>
Sol. As though the Eating of mans flesh <HI>Raw,</HI> or <HI>Sod,</HI> could
distinguish a <HI>Canniball.</HI> Ob. 5. But <HI>Saint Augustine spake
of Eating Christs flesh with hurting him, which appeareth by
this, that hee called the maner of Eating, which hee spake of, an
Hainous offence.</HI> Sol. As though your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above; Booke 4. Cap. 10 Sect. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Aquinas</HI> had not

thereby. Ob. 6. <HI>But he spake against the Caper∣naiticall
maner of Eating, which was Tearing it in pieces, and
requireth a Spirituall order in eating; and ours is Spirituall.</HI>
Sol. First as if your <HI>Eating</HI> were not <HI>Capernaiticall</HI> in any
degree, which is False. Because as the <HI>Capernaites</HI> interpre∣ted
Christs words in a <HI>literall sense</HI> of <HI>Eating</HI> it perfectly,
so did they also conceive a <HI>Reall Swallowing</HI> of it after it had
beene Eaten. And doth not your Cardinall plead here
wholly for <HI>Swallowing of Christs Body?</HI> or hath not also
your Iesuite <HI>Coster</HI> defined <HI>Devouring to be a Swallowing</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/>
<HI>of meat without Mastication, or Tearing?</HI> Or can you deny
but the Primitive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See before, in this Chap. 6.</NOTE> Fathers Detested the very conceipt of
<HI>Devouring Christs flesh?</HI> And Secondly, where <HI>Saint Augu∣stine</HI>

<HI>More speciall,</HI> because that all your Disputers, whensoever <MILESTONE N="20"/>
they produce them, for proofe of your Romish Doctrine of
<HI>Corporal Vnion,</HI> they esteeme them <HI>Insoluble</HI> above all others;
Insomuch that one of your Doctors, after hee had objected
the Sentences of <HI>Irenaeus, Greg. Nyssen, Damascen, Leo,</HI> and
<HI>Saint Augustine,</HI> no sooner nameth the Sentence of <HI>Hilarie,</HI>
but prefaceth of it, saying; <HI>This is a more notable Place.</HI>
Another concludeth the Doctrine of <HI>Cyril</HI> to be so abso∣lutely
Romish, that he accounteth Protestants no better than
<HI>Men sold over to the Devill,</HI> for not assenting to your Com∣mon
Interpretation of him. But this Flash of your Doctor <MILESTONE N="30"/>
will appeare to be but an <HI>Ignis fatuus,</HI> or a Blind <HI>Zeale with∣out
knowledge,</HI> when wee come to this Particular.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Interim,</HI> that you may know wee meane to deale
clearely, wee First grant unto you the Scope of either of
these two Fathers, in their Discourses. <HI>Hilarius</HI> sought to
confute the <HI>Arian</HI> Heretikes by defending a <HI>Naturall Vnion</HI>
of the Godhead of Christ, the sonne of God, with God
the Father. <HI>Cyril</HI> intended to convince the <HI>Nestorian</HI> Here∣tikes,
for proofe of an <HI>Hypostaticall Vnion</HI> of the two Na∣tures,
Godhead and Manhood, in one person of Christ. Se∣condly,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
wee grant that both the Fathers, together with that
<HI>Generall Councel at Ephesus,</HI> call the Flesh of Christ, which
Christians participate in this Sacrament, <HI>[Vivificatricem,]</HI>
that is, <HI>Vivificall, or giving life to the Receivers, even unto
Immortality.</HI> Thirdly wee grant, that they name our Con¦junction
of Christ by this Sacrament to be, not onely an
<HI>Vnion in Affection and Concord,</HI> but also a <HI>Naturall and Cor∣porall</HI>
<PB N="359" REF="199"/>
Conjunction of the Body of Christ with the Bodie
of the Communicants. And Lastly wee grant, that one of
them addeth a Similitude of the <HI>Vnion of Waxemelted with
Waxe.</HI> And yet notwithstanding all these our Acknow∣ledgements
and Grants, wee presume to affirme, that all
these Testimonies teach, indeed, a <HI>Mysticall,</HI> not your Ro∣mish
<HI>Missaticall Vnion,</HI> by a properly <HI>Corporall Touch</HI> of
Christs owne naturall Body, with the Bodies of the Recei∣vers.
Our ground is the same, which wee have often layd
<MILESTONE N="10"/> in our former Confutations (to wit) by paralleling this <HI>Vnion</HI>
of the Eucharist (as it is to be seene in the Margin) with
other <HI>Vnions</HI> mentioned by both these same Fathers, in as
Aequivalent and Equipollent termes (equally named by them
both) <HI>Naturall</HI> and <HI>Corporall;</HI> albeit voyd of any <HI>Corporall
Touch</HI> of the Body of Christ, as you your selves will
grant.</P>
<P>For the Instances, used by these Fathers, are divers,
Some consist onely in <HI>Relation,</HI> and some in <HI>Application</HI> also.
The Instance given in the <HI>Relative</HI> onely, is in respect of the
Incarnation of Christ, when hee tooke the same nature of
our flesh upon him; which Relation of a Christian mans flesh
<PB N="360" REF="200"/>
with the Humane flesh of Christ, is universally in all persons,
at all times (even without this Sacrament) called by <HI>Hilarie,
[Vnio Corporalis Nativitatis Christi]</HI> that is, an <HI>Vnion wrought
by Christ his Incarnation in our flesh,</HI> being the same <HI>Specifi∣cally</HI>
with his; and notwithstanding it is called by him an
<HI>Vnion Naturall and Corporall,</HI> and <HI>not onely the Vnion of Will
and Affection,</HI> albeit voyd of all <HI>Bodily Touch.</HI></P>
<P>Next of the <HI>Vnions</HI> made by <HI>Application,</HI> some are <HI>Spiri∣tually
onely,</HI> and some are <HI>Sacramentall</HI> also. Of the <HI>Spi∣rituall
Vnion</HI> (which is also free from all <HI>Bodily Touch)</HI> they <MILESTONE N="10"/>
say of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of <HI>True Christians,</HI> that they are <HI>Vnited
by the Vnity of Faith;</HI> which notwithstanding is likewise
called by him, a <HI>Corporall Vnion,</HI> and <HI>not onely in Will and Af∣fection.</HI>
I come to the <HI>Sacramentall Vnion.</HI> Some of this
kind are found in other Sacraments, and some in the Eucha∣rist
it selfe. Of others it is indefinitely here sayd, that <HI>Chri∣stians
are united by the Sacraments,</HI> and namely (as is confes∣sed)
<HI>The Regenerat, by Baptisme, have an Vnion Corporall
with Christ,</HI> and <HI>not onely in Affection and Concord:</HI> albeit
this also be (as you know) exempted from all <HI>Bodily Touch.</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
Accordingly of the <HI>Vnions</HI> made by the <HI>Eucharist;</HI> Some
are of Christians among themselves; and some of Christ
with us. Of the former, the <HI>Vnion of the faithfull Com∣municants,</HI>
as the Members of Christ, is named by them
a <HI>Naturall and Corporall Vnion,</HI> and <HI>not onely in Concord,</HI>
although (as you know) this can be no coincident <HI>Corpo∣rall
Touch</HI> of their Body <HI>reciprocally.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus these holy Fathers. And now that you may under∣stand,
from them, Foure several</HI> Vnions, <HI>One</HI> Relative; <HI>Ano∣ther</HI>
Spirituall; <HI>A third</HI> Sacramentall <HI>in Generall; And a <MILESTONE N="30"/>
Fourth (as I may say)</HI> Eucharisticall; <HI>(peculiar onely to the
Sacrament of the Eucharist) all of them equally named of
these Fathers</HI> Corporall and Naturall Vnions, <HI>and</HI> not Vnions
of Affection and Concordonely; <HI>notwithstanding each one of
the former Three exclude all</HI> Bodily Touch. <HI>Wee demand
therefore why all these Foure, being named</HI> Naturall and
Corporall, <HI>Improperly, onely the last should inferre a</HI> Reall
Corporall Touch of Christs Body, <HI>by the virtue of the same
words,</HI> Naturall, <HI>or</HI> Corporall? <HI>Your Cardinall giveth his
maine reason;</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 12.</HI> A∣liud esse, apud Hila∣rium, aliqua esse u∣num naturaliter, a∣liud autem, unum esse in alio naturali∣ter.

<HI>hee)</HI> Some things to be one Naturally; and to be one in another
Naturally: For things to be one Naturally, it is sufficient, if
both of them partake truly of the Nature of the thing wherein
they are one; and so hee calleth all Christians one Natu∣rally
by Faith. But to be one Naturally [In] another, it is ne∣cessary
that the Nature of the one be meerely within the Nature
of the other: and so (in the meaning of Hilarie) is Christs Bo∣dy
<PB N="361" REF="200"/>
sayd to be Naturally within ours by the Eucharist. <HI>This is
your Cardinalls Ground of Assoilement, whereupon hee
relyeth as on a Rocke, immoveable; which will instantly
prove as wavering as a Reed; both False and Fond; (as you
may finde in the Marginalls.)</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Hilarie</HI> speaking of one of the other <HI>Vnions,</HI> which
hee calleth <HI>Naturall,</HI> by reason of Christs Incarnation, in
taking our nature of Flesh upon him, saith that wee are <HI>[In
him.]</HI> Therefore is your Cardinalls Distinction False. Next
<MILESTONE N="10"/> of the very <HI>Sacramentall Vnion,</HI> whereof it is sayd, that
Christ is <HI>[Naturally In us,]</HI> it is also as expressely sayd, that
wee are likewise <HI>[Naturally In Christ.]</HI> But none can affirme,
that <HI>Wee,</HI> in true propriety of speech, are <HI>Naturally in the
Body of Christ.</HI> Therefore is his Answer most Absurd. But
you will aske, how then can this stand with the scope of the
same Fathers, for the Confuting of the two former Divers
Heresies, by an <HI>Onely Symbolicall</HI> and <HI>Mysticall Conjunction
with the Body of Christ?</HI> First thus; By our <HI>Eating and
Drinking in this Sacrament</HI> (according to Christs Institution)
<MILESTONE N="20"/> is professed a <HI>Vivificall flesh of Christ, giving eternall life un∣to
the world;</HI> which (as these Fathers truly teach) it could
not do, if it were the Flesh of a meere man: And therefore
he is, by <HI>Nature, God;</HI> one with God the Father. <HI>Ergò</HI> Avant!
Thou <HI>Arian-</HI>Heretike. The Second thus; The same <HI>Humane
flesh</HI> of Christ would not have the same divine <HI>Vivifical power
and virtue,</HI> except it were perfectly <HI>Vnited</HI> to his Godhead;
and therefore is <HI>Christ</HI> both <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man;</HI> and that not by
Relation of two different Persons onely, but by an <HI>Hypo∣staticall
Vnion of two Natures. Ergo</HI> thou <HI>Nestorian</HI> Heretike
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Recant.</P>
<P>The meaning of these holy Fathers is transparent enough,
by their owne Sentences, as is now proved; which if it nee∣ded
any further Illustration, might be manifested by the like
Testimonies of that Great <HI>Athanasius,</HI> who, from this Ar∣ticle,
of Christ his <HI>Incarnation</HI> onely, whereby his Godhead
assumed our nature of flesh, spared not to say:<NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">Athanasius Tom. 1. Orat. 4. Con∣tra Arianos, pag 487. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> that
<HI>By his flesh, thus assumed of the word,</HI> (God) <HI>wee men are Dei∣fyed
and made Gods.</HI> So hee; without any Relation to the
Sacrament at all. And againe, when he spake of the same Ar∣ticle
<MILESTONE N="40"/> of Christs Incarnation, he hath Relation to a Sacrament,
and saith as much of <HI>Baptisme,</HI> as either <HI>Hilarie</HI> or <HI>Cyril</HI> did
of the Eucharist.<NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg">Ibidem. pag. 486. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Wee,</HI> (saith hee) <HI>being borne againe of
water and the holy Ghost, are all made alive by Christ; and our
flesh is no more Earthly, but now by that [word,</HI> God] <HI>Wordi∣fyed,
and made the same by him, that for us was made flesh.</HI>
So hee. And so, according to the Romish presumption of
Arguing, from the like words of the Fathers, concerning
<PB N="362" REF="201"/>
the Eucharist, <HI>Athanasius</HI> must be sayd to have judged of
<HI>Baptisme.</HI> I. That the <HI>Substance of water is changed.</HI> II. That
by it, there is a <HI>Corporall Vnion</HI> properly with the Bodies of

or <HI>Spiritually,</HI> or <HI>Romishly,</HI> or else <HI>Sacramentally.</HI> But not <HI>Na∣turally,</HI>
to have his Body fed by the same his owne Body; for
this Conceipt, in your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above.</NOTE> own Judgement, is Absurd. Nor <HI>Spi∣ritually;</HI>
<PB N="368" REF="204"/>
Because hee needeth not any Spirituall helpe of

that any man was fed and feasted by an <HI>onely Touch.</HI> A Bul∣let,

not <HI>feed:</HI> Nutrition and Feeding being, Properly, a <HI>Sub∣stantiall

might thereby understand, that Hee did no more drinke his
owne <HI>Blood,</HI> than Hee, in <HI>Eating,</HI> did appeare to <HI>Eat</HI> his

they should be troubled to thinke;</HI> what? what, but that hee
<HI>Dranke</HI> his owne <HI>Blood?</HI> which sense of <HI>Chrysostomes</HI> the
sentence it selfe doth evince: <HI>lest that</HI> (saith hee) <HI>they should</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>

the words of Christ, Ioh. 6. of <HI>Eating</HI> his <HI>Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Drin∣king</HI>

<P>THe <HI>Sacramentall Vnion,</HI> which Protestants teach, (be∣sides

and the <HI>Substance of Bread and Wine,</HI> and this is <HI>Analogicall:</HI>
<PB N="371" REF="205"/>
which was the Ground of all the Fathers former Speeches,
concerning a <HI>Bodily Vnion</HI> with Christs Body in every De∣gree.
First then the Fathers, in their <HI>Symbolicall</HI> language,
have called <HI>Bread</HI> the <HI>Body of Christ,</HI> onely <HI>Sacramentally;</HI>
because it is a Sacrament and Signe of Christs Body; which
was the Conclusion of our Second Booke. II. They have
not spared to call the <HI>Change of Bread into our Bodies,</HI> a <HI>Change
of Christs Body into ours,</HI> in a like Sacramentall signification,
as hath beene shewed in the Third Booke. III. Vpon the
<MILESTONE N="10"/> same Sacramentall and Analogicall reason, they have used
to say, that <HI>wee See, Touch, Tast,</HI> and <HI>Eat Christs Body,</HI> albeit
Improperly, as hath beene plentifully declared, and con∣fessed

<HI>Bodily Nourishment and Augmentation by Christs Body;</HI> which
you your selves have confessed to be most <HI>Improperly spoken;</HI>

that wee are to acknowledge in the Objected Testimonies

of his Body and <MILESTONE N="10"/>

SECT. V.</HEAD>
<P>YOur Jesuites, <HI>Bellarmine, Tolet, Suarez,</HI> and <HI>Vasquez,</HI>
have already instructed you, not to take such Sayings of
the Fathers as they are uttered, lest the Fathers might be
held to be <HI>Absurd</HI> in themselves, or <HI>Derogatory to the Dig∣nity
and Majesty of this Sacrament.</HI> And they say well. But
it had beene better if they had furthermore unfolded unto
us the Fathers true <HI>Mysticall</HI> meaning therein; which wee <MILESTONE N="20"/>
must endeavour to do out of the premised Sentences of the
same Fathers; to the end that you, and wee, may make an
holy and comfortable use of their Divine meditations upon
this Sacrament. They have sayd, I. That <HI>Christ hath a Na∣turall
Vnion by his Godhead with God the Father.</HI> II. That
this <HI>Godhead of Christ, by his Incarnation, is united Hyposta∣tically
into our Nature of Manhood in him;</HI> whereby wee have
with Christ our <HI>Naturall and Corporall Conjunction.</HI> III. That
by the same <HI>Hypostaticall Vnion of his Divine and Humane
Nature together, his Bodily Flesh is become the Flesh of God,
his Blood the Blood of God.</HI> IV. That these being the <HI>Flesh</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>and Blood of God,</HI> are become thereby to be <HI>Vivificall,</HI> that
is, <HI>giving Life, Blisse, and Immortality,</HI> both to the Bodies
and Soules of the Faithfull in Christ. V. That the Faith∣full,
by Reason of the <HI>Specificall Vnion</HI> of their Humane na∣ture,
with the <HI>Humane Nature of Christ,</HI> are made par∣takers
the reby of his <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> and of all the In∣finite
<HI>Vivification and power of grace,</HI> in this world; and
of <HI>Glory and Immortality,</HI> in the world to come, wrought
by his <HI>Death and Passion.</HI> VI. Both by <HI>Baptisme,</HI> and
by the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> wee have a <HI>Naturall and Corporall Vnion
with the Body of Christ, mystically;</HI> in as much as the <HI>Sacra∣ment
of Bread and Wine</HI> (the Choycest Refections of mans <MILESTONE N="40"/>
Bodily Life) are <HI>Touched, Tasted, Eaten, and Sensually mixed</HI>
with our Flesh to the nourishing and augmenting the same,
untill it become of the Essence of our Bodily Substance un∣separably.
Therfore hath this Sacrament most aptly beene
called a <HI>Pledge of an unspeakable Vnion of Christs Body with
ours unto Immortality, and an Earnest of our Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="206"/>
Lastly, from this Sacrament there resulteth a <HI>Spirituall
Vnion,</HI> continuing in the Faithfull after the Receiving of this
Sacrament, even all their life long; and notwithstanding
called by the same Fathers <HI>Corporall</HI> and <HI>Naturall,</HI> that is,
(as they interpret themselves) from the <HI>Nature of Faith,</HI>
by believing that Christ had truly a <HI>Naturall and Bodily flesh,
the same Specifically with ours:</HI> Which <HI>Vnion,</HI> your Jesuites
have beene enforced to acknowledge, to be in it selfe not
<HI>Properly a Corporall</HI> and <HI>Naturall Vnion,</HI> but <HI>Spirituall</HI> and
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>Mysticall,</HI> wrought onely in the Soule. But how? This in∣deed
is worthy our knowledge, as a matter full of Christian
Comfort. Thus then: The Disposition of the Body, in
Christian Philosophy, followeth the Disposition of the
Soule: For when the Soules of the Faithfull, departing this
life in the state of Grace, and the Soules likewise of the
Vngodly passing but from hence into the thraldome of Sin,
shall resume their owne Bodies; by virtue of that Resump∣tion,
shall be made possessors of Life and Blisse both in Bo∣dy
and Soule; and the Wicked (contrarily) of Curse and
<MILESTONE N="20"/> Damnation in both, according to that Generall Doome,
<HI>Come you Blessed,</HI> unto the one, &amp;c. and <HI>Goe you Cursed,</HI> to
the other, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Nor will your learned</HI> Suarez <HI>deny this.</HI><NOTE N="22" PLACE="marg"><HI>Suarez in 3. Tho. qu 79.

<HI>So hee.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing now remaineth but the last exercise of Faith,

sayd, <HI>Take thou Iohn,</HI> and <HI>Take thou Peter, My Body given

So then as my Bodily hand taketh the Sacramentall

was not this necessary for the freeing of the Christian Faith

Because nothing was more familiar, even unto the Heathen

<HEAD>First of Christs words.

can probably inferre a Proper Sacrifice; not the first

SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHen wee call upon you for a Proofe, by the words of
Christ, we exact not the very word <HI>Offering,</HI> or <HI>Sacrifice,</HI>
in the same Syllables, but shall bee content with any Phrase of
equivalencie, amounting to the sense or meaning of a <HI>Sacrifice.</HI>
In the first place you object those words of Christ, <HI>[Hoc facite:
Doe this.]</HI> from which your Councell of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">[Hoc facite] Tunc, utà Sancto Sy∣nodo definitum est, Christus Sacerdotes instituit, praecepirgue ut &amp; ipsi &amp; qui <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> eis essent, corpus ejus immolarent. <HI>Ca∣techis. Trid. de Euch. Num. 58.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Trent</HI> hath collected
the <HI>Sacrificing of the Body of Christ:</HI> which your Cardinall avouch∣eth <MILESTONE N="30"/>
with his<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Cerium est, pro∣bari Sacrificium Mis∣sae his verbis, [Hoc fa∣cite] &amp;c. <HI>Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Certum est,</HI> as a truth without all exception; as if
<HI>[Doe this]</HI> in the literall sense, were all one with <HI>[Doe you Sacri∣fice,]</HI>
But why? because, forsooth, the same word in the <HI>Hebrew</HI>
Originall, and in the <HI>Greeke</HI> Translation is elsewhere so used,
Levit. 15. for <HI>Doe,</HI> nor <HI>Make,</HI> spoken of the <HI>Turtle-dove</HI> prepared
for an <HI>Holocaust,</HI> or Sacrifice: and 1 King. 18. 23. where <HI>Elias</HI>
(speaking of the <HI>Priests of Baal,</HI> and telling them that he meant
to have a <HI>Sacrifice,)</HI> said, <HI>Doe,</HI> or <HI>Make.</HI> So he, together with
some other Iesuites. But vainly, ridiculously, and injuriously.</P>
<P>I. Vainly, because the word, <HI>Doe,</HI> in those Scriptures did not <MILESTONE N="40"/>
simply in it selfe import a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> but only consequently (to
wit) by reason of the matter subject then spoken of, which was
a matter of Sacrifice: and are so explained by just circumstances,
as may appeare in the places objected, Lev. 15. where was speech
of a <HI>Turtle-dove,</HI> appointed for a Sacrifice. And so likewise in
1 King. 18. 23. was there mention of a <HI>Bullocke</HI> to be ordained for
a Sacrifice. Whosoever, having spoken of his <HI>Riding,</HI> shall com∣mand
one servant, saying, <HI>Make ready:</HI> and after, being an hungry,
<PB N="391" REF="215"/>
and having spoken of meat, shall command another, saying like∣wise,
<HI>Make ready,</HI> None can be so simple as to confound the dif∣ferent
senses of the same word <HI>Make,</HI> but knoweth right well
that the Significations are to be distinguished by the different
subjects of speech; the first relating to his <HI>horse,</HI> and the other
to his <HI>meat,</HI> and the like, wherein the different Circumstances
doe diversifie the sense of the same word.</P>
<P>II. Ridiculously. For if the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greeke</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gnaschah, Heb.</HI> the same in Greeke, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in Latine, <HI>Fa∣cio</HI> Iud. 6 29.

<HI>Christs washing his Disciples feet.</HI> A fourth (to goe no further) in
the Mans <HI>Loosing</HI> of his <HI>Colt.</HI> In all which Instances there are the
same originall words now objected, by interpretation, <HI>Doe,</HI> or
<HI>Make.</HI> Even as it was also in Christs words to <HI>Iudas,</HI> then, when
that Monster was plotting that heinous Treason, saying. [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>]
<HI>That which thou doest, doe quickly.</HI> Can your Alchymists

many thousands of yeares before our Lord Christ was in∣carnate
in the flesh, to take unto him either <HI>Body,</HI> or <HI>Blood.</HI>
And therefore could not the Fathers understand, by the <HI>Sacri∣fice

his Body and Blood; these being then the Object of <HI>Melchise∣dech's</HI>
faith, as the cited Sentences of <HI>Hierome</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> do

to object the word <HI>Sacrifice</HI> out of the Fathers, as properly

have something to offer, else hee were no Priest. Thus his Priest∣hood <MILESTONE N="30"/>
is called Eternall, and must have a perpetuall offering, which
was not that upon the Crosse. Nor can that suffice, which the Pro∣testants
say, That his Priesthood is perpetuall, because of the per∣petuall
virtue of his Sacrifice upon the Crosse; or bicause of his

his passion to his Father in Heaven, whither his Priesthood
was translated. No, but it is certaine that Christ cannot now pro∣perly
sacrifice by himselfe, Hee doth it by his Ministers in the Eu∣charist,
Because the Sacrifice of the Crosse, in respect of Christians,
is now invisible, and seene onely by Faith: which although it be <MILESTONE N="40"/>

than the Signe, therefore Christ herein offered is better than
the Lambe: But if (as the Sacramentaries say) the Eucharist
be but a Signe, then was the Paschall Lambe but the figure of
a Piece of Bread, wherewith there is no Similitude. But that
the things prefigured are more excellent than their Signes, is
proved out of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, in preferring the

this is not Bread, but the Body of Christ. <HI>So hee. The An∣swer
is easie, by a Distinction of</HI> Things prefigured. <HI>Some

judged a <HI>Figure of Christ's Sacrifice,</HI> and not the <HI>Proper Sa∣crificing</HI>

with <HI>Christ's Body;</HI> and the <HI>Water of the Rocke,</HI> and <HI>Water of
Baptisme,</HI> with his <HI>Blood,</HI> and your Consequence is most Di∣vine:
<HI>viz. The Thing prefigured excelleth, beyond all Compa∣rison,

and <HI>Antitypes,</HI> viz. <HI>Manna</HI> with <HI>Bread,</HI> and the <HI>Water of the
Rocke</HI> with <HI>Wine in the Cup:</HI> and in their Natures and Sub∣stances,
the one doth not exceed the other.</P>
<P>You will then aske, If the Sacraments of both Testaments <MILESTONE N="10"/>
were in this maner joynt <HI>Antitypes,</HI> that is, Correspondent
<HI>Signes</HI> of the same <HI>Body and Blood of Christ;</HI> wherein then
consisteth the <HI>Excellencie</HI> of the Sacraments of the New, if
it be not in respect of their naturall and substantiall proper∣ties?
Wee were about to tell you, namely, that Although
these former Sacraments of both Testaments be but Cor∣porall
food, and drinke; yet have the Sacraments of the
Gospell a threefold Privilege above the other. The First is
in respect of the <HI>Efficacie of the Signification.</HI> Signes of the
Old being Propheticall, and darkly promising <HI>Christ's Body</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
<HI>and Blood</HI> to come. But, Signes of the New are Historicall,
poynting out, unto life, Christ already come, and crucified
in his Body, and his Blood shed. The Second, in respect of
the <HI>Efficacie of Application,</HI> and <HI>Exhibition</HI> of both these,
arising from the former Ground. For Saint <HI>Paul</HI> said more
effectually, <HI>Christ, who dyed for mee, and gave himselfe for
mee;</HI> than any Israelite under the Law could say, <HI>Christ,
who shall dye for mee, and shall give himselfe for mee.</HI> The
Third is the <HI>Excellencie of Duration,</HI> for those Signes as
<HI>Shadowes,</HI> had an end long since: Whereas the Evangelicall <MILESTONE N="30"/>
Symbols, as Images, are to be perpetuall to the end of the
world, as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> did intimate in his speech of the Eu∣charist,
<HI>You shew the Lord's death untill his coming againe,</HI>
1 Cor. 11. Now then that you see what is, indeed, the <HI>Bet∣ternesse</HI>
betweene the figure and thing figured, may you not
say it had beene better that your Disputers had forborne

<HI>Spirituall Duties,</HI> which are unproperly called <HI>Incense.</HI> There∣fore
may wee as justly conceive, that the word, <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> used
<PB N="431" REF="235"/>
by them, and applyed to the service of God in the New Te∣stament,
was meant Improperly; and that so much the rather,
because your Cardinall hath no Objection out of the Fathers
for his advantage in the word, <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> which hee loseth not
by the word <HI>Incense,</HI> from point to point.</P>
<P>For to the first Objection wee oppose, saying, The word
<HI>Incense,</HI> is likewise used without<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">See in the Te∣stimonies above cited, for it is called abso∣lutely <HI>Incense,</HI> and not <HI>Incense of Pray∣er, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Addition.</HI> To the second,
Wee accordingly say, <HI>Incense</HI> was meant also to be <HI>Pure:</HI> for
you will not imagine, that God would promise to his faithfull
<MILESTONE N="10"/> in Christ <HI>Impure</HI> things. To the third, It is as well said concer∣ning
<HI>Incense,</HI> as of <HI>Sacrifice</HI> (against the Iewes, vers 10.) <HI>I will
not receive any offerings at your hands:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isaiah 1. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Incense is an abomina∣tion

joyntly contemne Gods worship made by <HI>Incense,</HI> as by <HI>Sacri∣fice,</HI>
except you shall thinke it credible, that the same men
should be both devout and profane in one prescribed Service
of God. To the last, <HI>Malachy</HI> in the same Sentence (and as it
were with the same breath) equally taketh exceptions to the
Iewish <HI>Priests,</HI> in both <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> and <HI>Incense.</HI> Therefore, as
<MILESTONE N="20"/> the word, <HI>Incense,</HI> so accordingly the word, <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> was used
Improperly of the Fathers. Do you not now see what reason
your Cardinall had, to make choise of a corrupt Text, wanting

to take them Subjectively, as being the proper <HI>Materiall Subject</HI>
of this Sacrament; the other is to understand them Objective∣ly,
that is, to accompt the <HI>Body and Blood</HI> of Christ, as they
were the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Christ upon the Crosse, to be onely the <MILESTONE N="20"/>
proper <HI>Object</HI> of a Christian Celebration, according to the

<HEAD>The fifth Demonstration,
Because the Body and Blood of Christ, as they are pretended by

Representative Sacrifice spoken of by Ancient Fathers;
against your vaine Instance in a Stage-play, being
the last refuge of your desperate Disputers
wherein their whole Defense
<MILESTONE N="10"/> consisteth.
SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Subject matter of this Sacrament (by you called
the <HI>same Sacrifice, which Christ offered up upon the Crosse)</HI>
ought to be <HI>Representative,</HI> and fit to resemble the same <HI>Sacri∣fice</HI>
of his <HI>Passion,</HI> is a matter unquestionable among all. In
which respect the Fathers have so often called it a <HI>Sacrifice of
Commemoration, Representation,</HI> and <HI>Remembrance;</HI> and that
<MILESTONE N="20"/> the thing to be represented is his <HI>Body crucifyed,</HI> and his <HI>Blood
shed</HI> in that <HI>Sacrifice of his Passion,</HI> is a point as questionlesse:
which accordeth both to the words of Christ his Institution
<HI>[Do this in remembrance of mee,]</HI> and to the Exposition of
Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> to be a <HI>[shewing forth of the Lords death untill hee
come:]</HI> yea and is also consonant to the last mentioned Do∣ctrine
of the Fathers, calling it <HI>A Sacrifice of Christ, or rather
a Remembrance thereof.</HI></P>
<P>The onely Question will be, how <HI>This,</HI> which you call <HI>The
same Sacrifice,</HI> meaning the Body of Christ, subjectively in the
<MILESTONE N="30"/> Eucharist, being invisible, can be said to represent, figure, and
resemble the same <HI>Body,</HI> as it was the <HI>Sacrifice on the Crosse?</HI>
Wee yielding unto you a possibility, that one thing, in some
respects, may be a Representation of it selfe. Your Triden∣tine
Fathers to this purpose say, that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Concil. Trident.</HI> Christum reliquisse Sacrificium Ecclesiae suae visibile, quo cru∣entum istud in Cru∣ce peragendum re∣praesentaretur. <HI>Ses. 22. ca. 1.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Christ left this visible
Sacrifice to his Church, whereby his Body sacrificed on the Crosse
should be represented.</HI> So they. From whom (it may seeme)
your Rhemists learned that Lesson, which they taught others,
that<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Rhemists Annot. in Luc. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Christs Body, once visibly sacrificed upon the Crosse, In
and By the selfe same Body is immolated and Sacrificed under the</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/><HI>shapes of Bread and Wine, and is most perfectly thereby resem∣bled:

Christ on the <HI>Crosse.</HI> This is manifest by two especiall Reasons;
the first, because that which hee calleth <HI>Vnbloody,</HI> hee termeth

<P>Secondly, <HI>Clemens</HI> calleth the same <HI>Vnbloody Sacrifice</HI> the

<P>The <HI>Apostate</HI> objecteth (See the Margin) as an Exception
against Christians, that they are not <HI>Circumcised,</HI> that they <HI>use</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/>
<HI>no Azymes, nor keepe the Passeover of the Iewes:</HI> albeit, <HI>Cain,

<HI>offered Sacrifices unto God.</HI> But they (saith <HI>Iulian,</HI> writing of
Christians) <HI>erect no Altars unto God, offer no such Sacrifices as
were of old, nor invent any new, but say that Christ was once offe∣red
for them.</HI> This Objection (you see) is pertinent to our
Cause in hand, and as consonant will the Answer of the holy
Patriarch <HI>Cyril</HI> be; who to the other points held it Satisfacti∣on
enough to say (see againe the Marginalls) <HI>That wee Christi∣ans</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
<HI>have the spirituall Circumcision of the heart: That wee ob∣serve
the spirituall Azymes of Syncerity and Truth:</HI> And as for
the <HI>Passeover, Christ our Passeover was offered up,</HI> namely upon
the Crosse (for so is it answerable to the words objected by
<HI>Iulian.)</HI> And to the Objection of <HI>not erecting Altars, Cyril</HI> saith

<P>Here will be no place for your Answer, to tell us that the

<P>Neverthelesse, wee should confute our selves, for objecting

seeme to have beene purposely done, to conceale it from <HI>Iulian,</HI>
the Patron of Heathenish worship. So indeed wee should have
thought, but that then <HI>Iulian</HI> and <HI>Cyril</HI> both would as readily

also would controll us, who in his whole Answer (opposing

<P>THree Properties are required of you, as necessary to a

So you in <HI>Thesi,</HI> wee descend to the <HI>Hypothesis.</HI></P>
<P>But before wee enter into this Disquisition, wee shall desire
you to take unto you the spirits of reasonable men, whilest wee
<MILESTONE N="30"/> reason the matter with you in few words. First, it cannot be
called <HI>Properly Visible,</HI> which is not <HI>Visible</HI> in it selfe. But the
<HI>Body of Christ,</HI> which you call the <HI>thing sacrificed,</HI> is not <HI>Visi∣ble</HI>
in it selfe, but onely (as your Councell of<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Conc. Trid. and Bellarm above cited, §. 3. at (a.)</NOTE> <HI>Trent</HI> hath
taught) <HI>In the forme of Bread;</HI> and then, how invisible it is,
onely blinde men can be ignorant. Nor will wee thinke All,
among you, to be so blinde, seeing that wee heare one (and
that a Iesuite) acknowledging his eye-sight, and plainly,
<HI>without Parables,</HI> saying, that<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sal∣meron.</HI> Christus cruentus, &amp; incruentus, non differunt, sed quod ille visibilis, hic invisibills. <HI>Tom 9 Tract. 29.</HI> § Iam de.</NOTE> <HI>Christ in the Eucharist is in∣visible.</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<PB N="468" REF="254"/>
So hee. Therefore the first Property of a proper Sacri∣ficing
Subject is wanting in your Romane Masse.</P>
<P>Secondly, wee will not judge any of you so blasphemous,
as to say, that the <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> by your <HI>Consecration,</HI> is of
a <HI>Prophane thing made sacred,</HI> which wee are sure your ancient
Romish Schoole did deny; which concluded that<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aquinas.</HI> Be∣nedictio sacerdotalis fertur super terminū à quo, non super ter∣minum ad quem, i. e. super corpus Christi. <HI>In 1. Cor. 10.</HI></NOTE> <HI>It is
not Christ that is made sacred, by benediction of the Priest, but
that which the Priest first taketh in his hands to blesse.</HI> And so
your Act of <HI>Consecration,</HI> by defect of the second property;
is no proper Sacrificing Act of the Body and Blood of <MILESTONE N="10"/>
Christ.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it will be as incredible even in your owne Iudge∣ments,
that the <HI>Body of Christ</HI> should be properly <HI>Destroyed.</HI>
Wee say, in your owne Iudgements, who therefore are con∣strained
to say,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellar.</HI> Cor∣pus Christi per con∣secrationem accepit formam cibi, &amp; ad comestionem &amp; de∣structionem ordina∣tur: &amp; licet nullam laesionem patiatur in se, neque amittit suum esse naturale, sed amittit.

<P>Well then, the State of the Question, as your Cardinall
himselfe hath set it downe, is (seeing that every <HI>Proper Sacri∣fice</HI>
requireth a <HI>Proper Destruction,</HI> and, if it be a <HI>living Sacri∣fice,</HI>
a <HI>Destruction</HI> by death) Whether Christ be properly
Sacrificed, or no. Marke, wee pray you, your Cardinal's Re∣solution.
<HI>His bloody Sacrifice was but once truly and properly done,

<P><HI>Every</HI> proper Sacrifice <HI>is</HI> properly Visible, <HI>of</HI> Prophane <HI>is</HI>
made Sacred, <HI>and</HI> properly suffereth Destruction. <HI>(This is your

And that so much the rather, because it cannot be sufficient,
that Christs Body be present in the Eucharist, to make it a
Sacrifice, without some <HI>Sacrificing Act.</HI> A Sheepe is no Sa∣crifice
whil'st it remaineth in the Fold, nor can every Action

hath hitherto beene proved.</P>
<P>Is it not then a miserable case which you are in, to suffer your
selves to be deceived by such Mountebankes, who pretend to
direct mens Consciences in the Mysteries of Christian Faith,

to the state of the New Testament, in the same Chapter, vers.
13, 14. But much more by his owne Conscience, who having
spent some Chapters, in proving that the <HI>Sacrifices of the Law
were Types of the Sacrifice in the Masse,</HI> doth now deny that this
Proposition of <HI>[No Remission of sinnes without sheedding of

<MILESTONE N="20"/> to adde a second Answer, given by your <HI>Maldonate,</HI> who
finding no security in the former Refuge, betaketh himselfe to
another, saying that<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Si accommode∣mus ad Evangelium, dicendum est, pecca∣ta nunc remitti, non propter praesentem effusionem, sed per prae eritam. <HI>Maldon. Ies. lib. de 7.

Which Answer (if wee may so interpret it) is a plaine Preva∣rication.
The Reason may be this; because there was never
<HI>Bloody Sacrifice</HI> (Christ on the Crosse excepted, which onely
was of infinite virtue, as well to times past, as to come) but it
was alwayes actually by the <HI>Effusion of Blood</HI> at the time of

<P>Wee have not done yet, but give you further to understand,

<P><HI>The OB.</HI> <Q>Romane Catholikes do commonly allow that it be called

<P>One Advantage herein may be this our further Observation,
that <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> as hee said of the BREAD Consecrated, that it is

<P>Our other Advantage will be, to learne the language of the

of the hope of their future Resurrection, when they shall be

<P><Q><HI>OB. II.</HI> You say that Ambrose interpreteth his naming of Bread,

But this man is as good an Objector as hee is an Observer; who
doth not know that which is common to all Writers, that what
the Author hath spoken somewhat more obscurely before, hee
<MILESTONE N="10"/> explaineth it with words more intelligible, albeit long after.</P>
<P><Q><HI>OB. III.</HI> But Ambrose said elswhere <HI>[Panis dicitur, sed Corpus ap∣pellatur;]</HI>
It is said to be Bread, but it is called the Body of Christ. So
saith hee here, Before Consecration it is named Bread, but after Conse∣cration
the Body of Christ is signified; here <HI>[Significatur]</HI> is the same
with <HI>[Nuncupatur;]</HI> Signified is the same with named, or called.</Q></P>
<P>ANSW. NAMED AND CALLED are onely Appellations of
the outward words, whereas [SIGNIFICATA] alwayes import
the sense of the same words, whether spoken or read; so that I
shal need, for Confutation, no more but to appeale unto the Ob∣jector
himself to distinguish the office of his cares &amp; eyes, where∣by
<MILESTONE N="20"/> hee apprehendeth onely words, from the Function of his
Brain-pan, in judging of their sense and signification.</P>
<P>A further Advantage upon this occasion may be had first from
another Allegation, of the Objector himselfe, out of Saint <HI>Am∣brose
lib. 5. de Sacrament. cap. 4. Dixi ante verba Christi panis
dicitur; post deprompta Christi verba, non panis dicitur, sed corpus
appellatur.</HI> Wee heare that Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> proveth, that that,
which is called the <HI>Body of Christ,</HI> was before Consecration that
which was called <HI>Bread:</HI> so that [Hoc] in Christ's speech, must
<MILESTONE N="30"/> signifie <HI>Bread,</HI> which marreth and dasheth your Romi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h and li∣terall
Exposition of Christ's words (the foundation of all your

<HI>Ambrose</HI> his Iudgement, that [Hoc] in Christ's speech beto∣kened
<HI>Bread,</HI> which, in the universall Iudgement of all Romish
Doctors, cannot be attributed to Christ's Body in a literall sense.
And Secondly to recognize the Art of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> (See Book. 2.
pag. 125.) in his misalleging the same words of <HI>Ambrose,</HI> thus;
<HI>[Post Consecrationem corpus Christi est,]</HI> instead of [CORPVS

<HI>Bellarmine</HI> believing it was so sayd of <HI>Cyril,</HI> as absolutely de∣nying

Sacred <HI>Oile</HI> to be no more <HI>Bare Oile,</HI> after Consecration,
as he said of the Eucharist, It was no more <HI>meere Wine</HI> after it
be Consecrated; thereby taught us to judge of both alike. E∣ven
as wee may say, upon the same reason, that the water of
Baptisme is, during the use thereof, <HI>no meere Water.</HI> But why?
even because it is <HI>Sacramentall;</HI> and that accordingly wee are
not to beleeve our Senses, when wee are in Contemplation of
this Sacrament, to thinke it now to be mere Water, but beleeve
it to be of another nature: else our naturall eyes and senses shall
<MILESTONE N="10"/> deceive our Spirituall sight of Faith, in discerning the Spiritu∣all
and Mysticall meanings thereof. Yea, and in this respect I
might have taxed <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> for inferring from such speeches
an absolute denying of the tryall, by sense, of the natural part of
the Sacrament, because hee might have beene instructed▪ By the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Booke 2. cap. 1. Sect. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Councell of Nice,</HI> of the meaning of such speeches of the Fa∣thers;
that Councell saying as much of Baptisme, thus, <HI>Bap∣tisme
is not to be considered with the eyes of our Bodies, but of our

<MILESTONE N="20"/> men from all Earthly conceipts, when they are conversant in
the Celebration of such sacred Mysteries. This wee have no∣ted,
Book. 3. pag. 207.</P>
<P>This also hath occasioned another Advantage against your
Romane Faith, by observing in the same place of <HI>Cyril</HI> ano∣ther
Sentence concerning this Sacrament: <HI>Coelestiall Bread</HI> (saith
hee) <HI>sanctifying both Body and Soule.</HI> But how both? it follow∣eth,
[<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>:] <HI>As the
Bread is congruous to the Body, so is the word</HI> (meaning Christ in

<MILESTONE N="30"/> hereby, but that calling the Sacrament [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] after Conse∣cration,
hee acknowledged not any Substantiall change there∣of;
and more demonstrably, because of the Comparison hee
hath of the Sacramentall applying of the Body of Christ to
the food of the Soule, as hee doth the Sacramentall <HI>Bread</HI> to
the nutriment of the Body, and Sanctification thereof, in hope
of Resurrection to life, as the Fathers have Commented.</P>

being generall, to take heed of his <HI>Hyperbole's,</HI> may be justly

<P>Our Advantage from this mans Cavillation is this: That hee

<HI>Bread after Consecration is the Body of Christ:</HI> Ergo, <HI>it is
meant to be really and Substantially Christs Body,</HI> as it was in the <MILESTONE N="10"/>

GREG. NYSSEN.</HEAD>
<P>A Summary Answer to this Objection, out of the Testimony
of <HI>Gregory Nyssen.</HI> Although <HI>Bellarmine</HI> doth not produce
the words of <HI>Nyssen,</HI> yet doth hee direct his Reader to <HI>Nyssens</HI>
Treatise of <HI>Manna,</HI> where the Sentence is, which is alleged
by others. Nor can hee be excusable, in that, having read the
Testimony now objected, hee did not thereby perceive that the
Fathers Sacramentall speeches are not to be taken in the rigidi∣ty
of the words. Our Advantage upon this occasion is, that,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
our Objectors referring us to the Arguments of <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> out
<HI>Greg. Nyssen,</HI> it hath caused us to light upon and to examine this
which followeth, urged by your Cardinall, for <HI>Transubstanti∣ation;</HI>
where speaking of the <HI>[Bread which came downe from hea∣ven,
and was prepared for us without seed, without tilling, without
mans worke: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> (saith <HI>Nyssen) is signifyed in this Mysterie,
nor is this an uncorporeall and unbodily thing: for how can a thing

uncorporeall and without a Body, be food unto a Body; But that thing
which is not uncorporeall, is altogether a Body]</HI> Now let us but
trie the Romish Faith by this <HI>Lydian Stone,</HI> and wee shall finde
it to be meerely counterfeit and base. For aske any of the Ro∣mish
Disputers, what it is, which in this Sacrament is knowne
to nourish, whether man or mouse? And they answer us that
the <HI>Accidents of Bread,</HI> voyd of the substance of <HI>Bread,</HI> is that
which is Nutritive. But <HI>Greg. Nyssen</HI> saith just the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat Contra∣ry,
[NOTHING CAN NOVRISH A BODY BVT THAT WHICH
<MILESTONE N="10"/> IS A CORPOREAL SVBSTANCE,] which being so spoken, in re∣spect
of the Eucharist, proveth infallibly that the Substance of
Bread remaineth in this Sacrament after Consecration; if so,
then, in the universall judgement of all the Doctors of the
Church of Rome, there can be no <HI>Transubstantiation.</HI></P>

[ILLVM, that is, making IT, his BODY, THAT IS, A FIGVRE

Grammar-learning, which teacheth the Particle [IS] <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,

him by an example, to make his fondnesse more palpable. Can

<P><HI>OB. III.</HI> <Q>Your Adversaries will complaine of this, seeing they are

(lest we might thinke him not to <HI>Insanire cum ratione)</HI> yieldeth

this Reason, why it should be meant of the time passed, before

<P><HI>OB. IV.</HI> <Q>Because of the words immediatly following, <HI>[Figura autem
non fuisset, nisi esset veritatis corpus:]</HI> shew that the word, <HI>[Figure,]</HI>
was not taken representatively,</Q> but Typically.</P>
<P>ANSW. When <HI>Tertullian</HI> spake onely narratively, by repea∣ting
the words of Christ, he must needs speak in the tense and
time when Christ uttered them, when hee sayd [IT IS MY
BODY, THAT IS, IS A FIGVRE OF MY BODY,] But after spea∣king
Enunciatively, with the Relation from his owne time <MILESTONE N="10"/>
when hee wrot, to the time of Christs Speech, which was the
distance of three hundred yeares, hee could not but use the
time perfectly past, saying, <HI>[It had not beene a figure]</HI> namely,
when Christ called it his Body, <HI>[except, &amp;c.]</HI> The Argu∣ment
of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> taken from those words of Christ, stands
thus: <HI>Christ in the Sacrament gave a figure of his Body; But a
figure is not a figure of a figure, therefore Christ gave a figure of
a True Body.</HI> Let us consult againe with <HI>Tertullians</HI> words of
Exposition, [IT HAD NOT BEENE A FIGVRE, EXCEPT
THERE HAD BEENE THE TRVTH OF HIS BODY:] But <MILESTONE N="20"/>
Christs Body had no TRVTH of BEING before his Incarnation
and time of his existence in the Flesh; and therfore [FVISSET]
extended not unto any Type, which had beene before Christs
being on earth. Wherefore this [HAD] of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> I hope,
will put this Objector to his <HI>Non putabam,</HI> or <HI>Had I wist.</HI></P>
<P>Our Advantages occasioned by this Accusation are great, and
divers: One is to discerne more clearly the then-Catholike Do∣ctrine
in the dayes of <HI>Tertullian.</HI> Next to observe the stupid
insatuation of our Romish Adversaries. The Last will be to

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Cts insisted upon by you, for proofe of <HI>Adoration;</HI>
are these; <HI>The Fathers injoyning a Concealment of
this Mysterie from some others:</HI> their <HI>Elevation of
the Host after Consecration:</HI> their <HI>Cautelousnesse in
administring it, without letting any part thereof fall
to the ground:</HI> their <HI>Bodily Gesture in token of Humiliation;</HI> and
their pretended <HI>Invocating on it.</HI> Wee acknowledge (that wee
<MILESTONE N="20"/> may begin with the first) how strictly often times the Ancient
Fathers generally prescribed to others, (which they observed
themselves) that this <HI>Mysterie</HI> should be kept <HI>secret</HI> from all per∣sons,
who were not <HI>initiated by Baptisme,</HI> and incorporated ther∣by
into the visible Church of Christ, were they <HI>Infidels</HI> or <HI>Ca∣techumenists</HI>
(that is) unbaptized Christians. Vpon this our
Confession, as the Base, hearken what a discant your Doctors
can chant, saying as followeth;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 2. ciiat Au∣gustin Serm. 10. de verbis Apostol. viz.</HI> Quod corpus dixit es∣cam, &amp; sanguinem potum, Sacramentum fidelium agnoscunt fideles—Be hanc phrasin [nôrunt fide∣les] habet in locis in∣finitis: at profectò non est fidelibus tan∣tùm notum, quòd corpus Christi fide percipiatur. <HI>Idem.

of the Eucharist that onely [Fideles nôrunt] the Faithfull
know it:</HI> and therefore wee must be perswaded they understood
<MILESTONE N="30"/> a <HI>Corporall Presence</HI> of Christ herein; and consequently a <HI>Divine
Adoration</HI> due unto it. Master <HI>Brerely</HI> swelleth big, in amplify∣ing
this Objection; take a brief of the whole. <HI>The Fathers profes∣sing
to write more circumspectly of this Sacrament, so as not daring
to explaine it, as Theodoret, Origen, Augustine, Chrysostome; this
were causlesse, if the Fathers had thought Christ's words figurative:
nor had it beene more necessary in this than in Baptisme, had the Fa∣thers
acknowledged no other presence in this, than in Baptisme, &amp;c.</HI>
So hee; and so also your Irish<NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">Mr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llon in his Reply, pag 221.</NOTE> Iesuite.</P>
<P>Well then, by your owne judgement, if it may be found that
<MILESTONE N="40"/> the Eathers observed a like <HI>Circumspection</HI> in the maner of utte∣ring,
and <HI>Cautelousnesse</HI> in concealing the Sacrament of <HI>Baptisme</HI>
from <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Catechumenists;</HI> then must you confesse that
this your Argument maketh no more for proofe of a <HI>Corporall
Presence</HI> in the Eucharist, as you would have it, than in <HI>Baptisme,</HI>
where you confesse it is no. And now behold the Fathers are as
precise in concealing the <HI>Mysterie</HI> of <HI>Baptisme,</HI> from all persons
unbaptized, even in as expresse termes as was spoken of in the
<PB N="512" REF="276"/>
Eucharist; <HI>Chrysostome</HI> saying, (against such Persons)<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrysost. in Gal. 4.</HI> Non natura, sed Dei promissio Sacra∣mentum fecit: sic re∣nascentia nostra na∣tura quidem nulla est, caeterum verbum Dei, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>The

are long since antiquated by disuse in Churches Christian, be∣cause
all are now baptized that come to behold this Sacrament.
If hereupon any Protestant shall inferre a <HI>Corporall Presence</HI> of
Christ in <HI>Baptisme,</HI> and consequently an <HI>Adoration</HI> of Christ in
the same Sacrament, you your selves (wee know) would but
hisse at him, in detestation of his Consequence, as judging it
Idolatrous.</P>
<P>But do you aske, why then the Fathers did teach Christians
not to speake of these <HI>Mysteries</HI> in the hearing of the <HI>Catechume∣nists?</HI>
Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> himselfe (whom your Cardinall hath <MILESTONE N="20"/>
brought in for defence of <HI>Corporall Presence)</HI> will resolve us, and
witnesse against him, telling him, not that the reason was the sub∣limity
of the matter, as though they could not apprehend it, but
because<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. Tom. 9.

in generall) <HI>the more ardently they would be coveted and desi∣red.</HI>
As for their not revealing them unto <HI>Infidels,</HI> the reason is
evident; <HI>Infidelity is a mocker,</HI> and they meant to preserve Christs
Sacrament from contempt. Thus your most specious Objection
serveth for nothing more than to prove your Disputers to be
wonderfully precipitant in their Arguing.<MILESTONE N="30"/></P>

<P>SEcondly, the <HI>Elevation of the Hoast</HI> over the head of the <HI>Priest</HI>

<P><MILESTONE N="10"/> Wee contrarily conceive, 1. that that <HI>Rabbinish interpretation</HI>

as you have done, a <HI>Corporall presence</HI> of Christ in this Sacrament <MILESTONE N="10"/>
<HI>after Consecration,</HI> from a <HI>Reverence</HI> which hath been yielded to
the same Sacrament, before it was consecrated? In which consi∣deration
your Disputers stand so much the more condemnable,
because, whereas they shew some Examples of a <HI>Bodily Incli∣ning
to the Sacrament,</HI> done <HI>before Consecration,</HI> yet <HI>after Conse∣cration</HI>
they have not produced any one.</P>
<P>But what newes now? We blush, in your behalfe, to repeat
the Instance which you have out of your <HI>Legends,</HI> of a<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. Brerely Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 9. Subd. 3. [Out of Bel∣larm. and Bellar. out of Antoninus.]</HI>—When (not unlike to the reproofe which God miraculously gave to <HI>Balaam</HI> by the speech of an Asse) a bruit-beast for our instruction did prostrate him∣selfe in reverence be∣fore the blessed Sa∣crament.</NOTE> <HI>Brute

it. Wee would have concealed this, but that you seeme to glory <MILESTONE N="20"/>
herein, <HI>as being for your Instruction, like to the reproofe given mira∣culously
to Balaam by his Asse.</HI> Well might this <HI>Legend</HI> have be∣come
that latter time of darknesse, wherein it was first hatched,
but not these cleare daies, wherein your mysteries of <HI>Delusions</HI>
have beene so often revealed, and when all Christians almost in
all Countries have taken knowledge of an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>BANKS HIS HORSE;</HI> according to his Masters owne Re∣lation.</NOTE> <HI>Horse</HI> taught by Art

vindication of his credit with them, commanded his Horse to
<HI>kneele before a Crucifix,</HI> and therby freed himselfe from suspition
of Diabolicall familiarity, according to the Principles of their
owne superstition. And for any one to conclude this to have bin
<HI>Gods miraculous work in that Horse,</HI> (as the other was in that Asse)
would seeme to be the reason of an unreasonable man; because
all <HI>Miracles</HI> alwaies exceed all power both of Art, and Nature;

<P><HI>YOur Instances are Three; the principall in</HI> Gorgonia, <HI>the Si∣ster

<PB N="517" REF="278"/>
we find that</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Greg. Nazian.

after that neither the Art of Physick, nor teares of her Parents,
nor the publike Prayers of the Church could procure her any health,
went and cast her selfe downe at the Altar, Invocating Christ, who
is honoured on the Altar, saying that she would not remove her head
from the Altar, untill shee had received her health: when (Oh admi∣able
event!) she was presently freed from her d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sease. <HI>This is the
Story set downe by</HI> Gregory Nazian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en. <HI>Hence your Cardinall
concludeth, that</HI> Gorgonia invocated <HI>the Sacrament, as being
the very Body and Blood of Christ, and calleth this</HI> An hot and
<MILESTONE N="10"/> stinging Argument; <HI>and so indeed it may be named, yet onely in
respect of them, whose consciences are scorched, or stung with
their owne guiltinesse of in forcing and injuring the Story, as will
now appeare.</HI></P>
<P>For first, why should wee thinke that she <HI>invocated</HI> the <HI>Sacra∣ment?</HI>
Because (saith your<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellar.</HI> Procum∣bens ante Altare co∣rā venerabili Sacra∣mento—Quid autem super altare colatur, dubium esse non po∣test, cum nihil ibi po∣natur nisi Panis &amp; Vinum, mutanda in corpus &amp; sanguinem Christi—Petium Martyrē valdè ussit pupugitque hic locus. <HI>Lib. 2. de Euch cap 14</HI></NOTE> Cardinall) <HI>she prostrated her selfe at
the Altar, before the Sacrament;</HI> which words <HI>[Before the Sacra∣ment]</HI>
are of his owne coyning, and no part of the Story. His
next reason; <HI>Because she is said to have invocated him, who is hono∣red</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>on the Altar.</HI> As though every Christian praying at the <HI>Table
of the Lord,</HI> to <HI>Christ,</HI> may not be justly said to <HI>Invocate him,</HI> who
is used to be <HI>Honoured</HI> by the Priest, celebrating the memory of
<HI>Christ</HI> thereon. Nay, and were it granted, that the <HI>Sacramentall
Symbols</HI> had beene then <HI>on the Altar,</HI> yet would it not follow,
that she <HI>invocated the Sacrament,</HI> as betokening a <HI>Corporall pre∣sence
of Christ</HI> (as your Disputers have fancied) no more than if
the said godly woman upon the same occasion presenting her
selfe at the sacred <HI>Font,</HI> wherin she had beene baptized, could be
thought to have invocated the <HI>water</HI> therein; because she was
<MILESTONE N="30"/> said to have <HI>invocated him, who is honoured</HI> in the Administration
of <HI>Baptisme.</HI> And furthermore it is certaine, that the <HI>Remainders</HI>
of the Sacrament in those daies were kept in their <HI>Pastophorium,</HI>
a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above, Book 4. Chap. 1. Sect. 10. As further also appeareth in the Liturgie of pope Clement; <HI>Acci∣piant Diacont reli∣quias, &amp; portent in Pastophoria</HI> (Doubt∣lesse from the <HI>Altar</HI> to a place remote.)

being there, which was in the <HI>Night,</HI> as the Story speaketh.</P>
<P>O! but she was <HI>cured of her disease at the Altar.</HI> And so were
other miraculous Cures wrought also at the Font of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above, Book 4. Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sect. 5.</NOTE> Baptisme.
But, for a Conclusion, wee shal willingly admit of <HI>Gregory Nazi∣anzen</HI>
to be Vmpier betweene us. He, in relating the Story, saith
of the Sacrament of the Eucharist;<NOTE N="9" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Orat. 11. quo supra.</NOTE> <HI>If shee at the time</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/><HI>of her invocating had laid up any part of the Antitypes</HI> (or Sym∣bols)
<HI>of the precious Body and Blood of Christ, that shee mingled
with her teares.</HI> So hee, calling the consecrated Sacrament
<HI>Antitypes,</HI> or <HI>Signes of Christ's Body:</HI> therby signifying, that the
Sacrament is not the <HI>Body and Blood of Christ,</HI> as hath been<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6.</NOTE> pro∣ved
unto you at large out of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> and other Greeke Fa∣thers,
<PB N="518" REF="279"/>
Whereas if indeed he had meant that the <HI>Body and Blood
of Christ</HI> had beene there <HI>corporally</HI> present, as that which was
<HI>Invocated;</HI> then now (if ever) it had concerned this holy Father
to have expresly delivered his supposition thus, <HI>viz. If she had at
that time of her Invocating laid up any whit of the precious Body and
Blood of Christ.</HI> Wee say <HI>of the Body and Blood of Christ,</HI> and not
(as hee said) of the <HI>Antitypes,</HI> or <HI>Signes of his Body and Blood.</HI>
Thus is your <HI>hot and stinging Reason</HI> become chilly, cold, and
altogether dronish.</P>
<P>Your second Instance is in <HI>Dionysius the Areopagite,</HI> who wri∣ting

<P><HI>Prosopopoeia</HI> then is a figure, when one calleth upon that which

said, <HI>Heare ô Heavens, and hearken ô Earth, Isa. 1.</HI> In like

<HI>Oh Church! Oh Water! Oh Crosse! Oh Feast!</HI> nothing
differing from <HI>Dionysius</HI> his <HI>Oh Divine Sacrament!</HI> yet each one
without any proper <HI>Invocation</HI> at all.</P>
<P>And that you may further understand, that this <HI>Dionysius</HI> his
OH! is as in voyce, so in sense the same which we judge it to be,<MILESTONE N="40"/>
what better Interpreter can you require of this Greeke Author
<HI>Dionysius,</HI> than was his Greeke Scholiast <HI>Pachymeres?</HI> who hath
given his Iudgement of this very speech directly, saying that
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Pachym. in locum Dionys. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ex Orat. 42.</NOTE> <HI>It was spoken as of a thing having life, and that fitly, as did Na∣zianzen,
saith he; O great and holy Pascha, &amp;c.</HI> And how should
this be otherwise? seeing <HI>Dionysius,</HI> at the writing hereof, was
not in any Church or place, where the <HI>Eucharist</HI> was <HI>celebrated,</HI>
<PB N="519" REF="279"/>
but privately contemplating in his mind upon this holy Myste∣rie.
The due consideration of these your former so frivolous,
and so false Objections provoketh us to cry out, saying, <HI>Oh So∣phistry,
Sophistry!</HI> when wilt thou cease to delude the soules of
men? In which maner of speech, notwithstanding, wee do not
<HI>Invocate,</HI> but rather detest, and abominate your Romish Sophi∣stry.
And lest any of you should stumble upon the Attribute,
which <HI>Dionysius</HI> giveth to the Eucharist, in calling it a <HI>Divine Sa∣crament,</HI>
as if it should imply a <HI>Corporall Presence therein,</HI> reade
<MILESTONE N="10"/> but one Chapter of the same Author, and hee will teach you to
say as much of many other things, wherein you will not believe

<P>In the third place is objected this saying of <HI>Basil; When the

that <HI>Then (as we see now done among us) it was Invocated upon, even

who not? But do you first, if you please, admire the wit of
your Cardinall in so framing his Consequence, and after abhor
his will to deceive you, when you have done: for he applieth the

<MILESTONE N="30"/> proofe of a <HI>Corporall Presence</HI> of Christ therein, and the <HI>Divine

not unknown to you, that the <HI>Greeke Church</HI> differeth from your

too: and that <HI>Basil</HI> was an Orthodoxe Greeke Father you will
not deny.</P>
<P>Thirdly, therfore (to come home unto you) wee shall be di∣rected
by the Objected words of <HI>Basil</HI> himselfe, appealing here∣in
to your owne consciences. For your <HI>Lindanus</HI> was, in the
estimation of your Church, the strongest <HI>Champion</HI> in his time
<PB N="520" REF="280"/>
for your Romane Cause; he, to prove that the <HI>forme of Conse∣cratio,</HI>
of the Eucharist standeth not in any prescribed words
in the Gospel, but in words of <HI>Invocation</HI> by prayer (as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Booke 1. Chap. 2.</NOTE> hath
been confirmed by a Torrent of Ancient Fathers) saith,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Paulus non tradidit formā Con∣secrationis, quod Ba∣silius ità illustrat, ut sano capiti nihil ad haec sit ullo modo re∣quirendum amplius, cap. 42. de Spir. san∣cto; Verba, dùm o∣stenditur panis (in∣quit) &amp; poculum be∣nedictionis, quis San∣ctorū nobis reliquit? <HI>Lindan. Panop. lib. 4. cap. 41.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That
the same is illustrated by these words of Basil, saying, What Fa∣ther

and not an <HI>Invocation</HI> of <HI>Adoration</HI> unto the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> as alrea∣dy

<P>Looke upon the Text againe, for your better satisfaction; It
speaketh expresly of an <HI>Invocation, when Bread is shewne:</HI> but
you deny that <HI>Bread is Invocated upon, untill after Consecration.</HI>
And <HI>Basils</HI> demanding <HI>[What Father before us hath left in writing

had expresly said, what Father before us hath left in writing <MILESTONE N="20"/>
the words of Invocating God by Prayer of Consecration of

agree: and that onely my Lord of Durham hath dealt inju∣riously
with them all.]</HI></Q> So hee. Even so, as it became an
egregious Seducer to say, as will now appeare. The par∣ties,
which are said to be injured, are no lesse than fower;
<HI>Bellarmine</HI> the Objector of <HI>Dionysius, Dionysius</HI> the Author
<MILESTONE N="40"/> objected, <HI>Pachymeres</HI> the Expositor of the same <HI>Dionysius,</HI>
referring us to the like Saying in <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> and lastly <HI>Na∣zianzen</HI>
himselfe; unto whose sentence wee were so refer∣red.
Whose words are these <HI>[ô great and holy Pascha:]</HI> which
words, sayd I, were spoken to the <HI>Feast of Easter,</HI> and not
to the Eucharist, and consequently not to Christ as Corpo∣rally
present therein. <Q><HI>Nay</HI> (saith the Seducer) <HI>by [Pascha]
was not meant the Feast of Easter, but the Eucharist, and
<PB N="522" REF="281"/>
that by [ô great and holy Pascha] Nazianzen declareth his
Invocation of Christ therein.</HI></Q> So hee. As soone then as
wee shall understand the words of <HI>Nazianzen</HI> aright, wee
shall easily discerne the Exposition of <HI>Pachymeres,</HI> and by
him the meaning of <HI>Dionysius,</HI> and consequently the meere
Sophistry (as I called it) of your Cardinall <HI>Bellarmine.</HI></P>
<P>The words of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> truly translated, are these; <HI>[But
ô Pascha, the great and holy, the purification of the world, for I
will speake unto thee as to that, which, as it were, hath Life.]</HI> The
last words, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] will assoile the whole doubt, which <MILESTONE N="10"/>
are spoken onely by way of a <HI>Metaphoricall</HI> Similitude,
thus; <HI>[As to that, which, as it were, hath Life:]</HI> thereby
implying, that it is in it selfe without Life, as both your <HI>Bil∣lius</HI>
the Translator of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> and <HI>Nicetas</HI> his Commen∣tator
and Expositor; and lastly, <HI>Nazianzen</HI> himselfe will
manifest. I. <HI>Billius</HI> (being hee whom the Romish Sedu∣cer
himselfe hath attested, and whom wee now assume for
our Proctor) translateth <HI>Nazianzen's</HI> words thus; [<NOTE N="11" PLACE="marg">Billius in Orat. 42. Nazianz.</NOTE> <HI>To
enim quasi vitâ praeditum alloquar. For I will speake unto thee,
even as having Life:</HI> or, <HI>to that, which, as it were, hath Life:]</HI><MILESTONE N="20"/>
Wee demand then, would any but an Anti-Christian say of
Christ, that he is but a <HI>[Quasi] one who, as it were, hath Life?</HI>
Secondly <HI>Nicetas,</HI> Metropolitane of <HI>Heraclea,</HI> is a professed
and privileged Expositor of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> him wee desire to be
our Advocate in this Cause. [<NOTE N="12" PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicetas in lo∣cum ipsum Nazianz.</HI> [O Pascha magnum &amp; sacrum Pascha, &amp;c.] Haec verba Na∣zianzeni ad Festum ipsum perinde ac vitâ praeditum refert.</NOTE> <HI>These words of Nazianzen
[ô great Pascha, I say, ô sacred Pascha] Nazianzen</HI> (saith
hee) <HI>referreth unto the Feast it selfe, as if it were indued with
Life.]</HI> So hee. Do you not see how the words [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>]
that is <HI>[As it were having Life]</HI> compelled this learned Bi∣shop
to expound the words of <HI>Nazianzen</HI> as meant properly <MILESTONE N="30"/>
of <HI>[The Feast it selfe]</HI> called in Greeke and Latine <HI>Pascha,</HI>
and by us <HI>Pace</HI> or <HI>Easter,</HI> and not to the <HI>Eucharist?</HI> which was
that my Conclusion, against which the Romish Seducer hath
revelled, and thereupon in a maner reviled me, to make me a
Falsificator like himselfe.</P>
<P>Lastly <HI>Nazianzen</HI> is hee, whom wee reserve for our Pa∣tron
in this Cause. The subject matter of the whole Oration
of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> now mentioned, is (as all know that have read
it) the Celebration of the <HI>Great and holy Feast of Easter,</HI> of
the which Feast, some few lines after his entrance into his <MILESTONE N="40"/>
Oration, hee hath these words; <HI>[Pascha of the Lord, Pascha,
and (in honour of the Trinity) I say the third time Pascha. This
is the Feast of Feasts, and Celebrity of Celebrities;]</HI> expresly
speaking not of Christ the Lord, nor of the Eucharist, but
of that which hee calleth <HI>The Feast of Feasts:</HI> namely, that,
which hee as expresly named <HI>The Pascha of the Lord:</HI> which
words in the beginning of <HI>Nazianzen's</HI> Oration most harmo∣niously
<PB N="523" REF="281"/>
accord unto his words now controverted in the end
of the same Oration with Ecchoing as it were to the Former
saith <HI>[ô great and holy Pascha]</HI> namely, in respect of the same
<HI>Pascha, the Feast of Feasts, and Celebritie of Celebrities.</HI></P>
<P>But this Romish Seducer, never considering these Premi∣ses,
peremptorily posteth on, objecting onely the words of
<HI>Nazianzen</HI> immediately following, which unto a Cursory
Reader, might seeme to make, for him, some shew of Con∣futation;
for thus hee proceeds: <HI>[ô word of God, and Light, and</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>Life, and Wisedome, and Power, for I am delighted with all thy
names, &amp;c.]</HI> Which words we confesse are spoken of Christ,
and not of the Feast, whereupon your Seducer concludeth, that
the former words <HI>[ô Pascha]</HI> refer likewise to Christ. Which
his Erroneous conceipt hath beene long since confuted by
the forenamed Bishop <HI>Nicetas,</HI> expresly affirming of these
words that <HI>They were spoken of the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See above a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> [12]</NOTE> <HI>Feast,</HI> and these last words
<HI>[ô Word of God and Light, &amp;c.] are spoken indeed to Christ the
spirituall Pascha.</HI> But how? by <HI>Invocation?</HI> no: but by <HI>Ac∣clamation</HI>
(saith hee) nothing being more Familiar to Ora∣tors,
<MILESTONE N="20"/> than to use <HI>Apostrophe's,</HI> by Transition from the <HI>Signe</HI>
to the <HI>Thing signified:</HI> as here, from the <HI>Signe,</HI> which was
Christ's day of Resurrection, to the Contemplation of the
person risen againe.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, were it that this had beene an <HI>Invoca∣tion</HI>
of Christ, yet except it had beene an <HI>Invocation</HI> of him,
as hee was then in the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> it maketh nothing at all for
<HI>Bellarmines</HI> Conclusion, which was thus, <HI>Ergò Christ is cor∣porally
is this Sacrament, and to be Divinely adored therin.</HI></P>
<P>By all which you may clearly discern the true meaning of
<MILESTONE N="30"/> the first objected Author <HI>Dionysius</HI> from his Expositor <HI>Pa∣chymeres.</HI>
II. The Iudgement of <HI>Pachymeres,</HI> by his Re∣ference

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou are not to require of us, that wee produce
the expresse Sentences of ancient Fathers, con∣demning
the <HI>Ascribing of Divine honour to the
Sacrament,</HI> seeing that this Romish Doctrine
was neither in Opinion nor Practice in their

have beene extant in the Christian world for the space of sixe

to extract from them any proofe of a <HI>Divine honour,</HI> as due to
this Sacrament, either in expresse words, or practice; insomuch
that you are enforced to obtrude onely such Sentences, and
Acts, which equally extend to the honouring of the Sacra∣ment
of <HI>Baptisme,</HI> and other sacred things, whereunto (even
according to your owne Romish Profession) <HI>Divine honour</HI> can∣not
be attributed without grosse <HI>Idolatry:</HI> and neverthelesse
have your Disputers not spared to call such their Objections <MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Cleare Arguments, piercing,</HI> and <HI>unsoluble.</HI></P>
<P>Wee therfore make bold hereupon to knocke at the Consi∣story
doore of the Conscience of every man, indued with any
small glimpse of Reason, and to entreat him, for Christs sake,
whose Cause it is, to judge betweene <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Vs,</HI> after hee
hath heard the case, which standeth thus; <HI>Divine Adoration</HI> of
the Host is held to be, in the Romish Profession, the principall
practicke part of Christian Religion.</P>
<P>Next, the ancient Fathers of the Church were the faithfull
Registers of Catholike Truth, in all necessary points of Chri∣stian <MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Divine worship.</HI> They in their Writings ma∣nifoldly
instructed their Readers by Exhortations, Admoniti∣ons,
Perswasions, and Precepts how they are to demeane
themselves in the receiving of this Sacrament; not omitting
any Act, whereby to set forth the true <HI>Dignity,</HI> and <HI>Reverence</HI>
belonging unto it; many of the same Holy Fathers sealing that
their Christian profession with their Blood. It is now referred
<PB N="525" REF="282"/>
to the Iudgement of every man, whether it can fall within his
capacity to thinke it Credible, that those Fathers, if they had
beene of the now Romish Faith, would not have expresly de∣livered,
concerning the due <HI>Worship</HI> of this Sacrament, this one
word consisting but of two syllables [viz. <HI>Divine]</HI> for directi∣on
to all Posterity, to adore the Sacrament with <HI>Divine honour,</HI>
even as it is taught in the Church of Rome at this day: and to
have confirmed the same by some <HI>Practice,</HI> not of one or other
private man or woman, but by their publike forme of <HI>Prayer,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10"/> and <HI>Invocation</HI> in their solemne <HI>Masses;</HI> or else to confesse,
that Antiquity never fancied any <HI>Divine Adoration</HI> of the
Eucharist.</P>
<P>Yet two words more. You presse the point of the <HI>Invoca∣tion
of the Sacrament</HI> more urgently and vehemently than any
other: and wee indeed believe that the ancient Fathers (if they
had held, according to the now Romane Church, a <HI>Corporall
presence of Christ)</HI> would never have celebrated any <HI>Masse,</HI>
without an expresse <HI>Invocation</HI> of the Sacrament, as in your
now-Romane Masse, wee finde it done, saying, <HI>O Lambe of</HI>
<MILESTONE N="20"/><HI>God, &amp;c.</HI> or some other like forme. Yet know (now) that your
owne learned <HI>Pamelius</HI> hath published two large Tomes of all
the <HI>Masses in the Latine Church,</HI> from Pope <HI>Clemens</HI> downe to
Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> (containing the compasse of six hundred yeares)
wee say, <HI>Latine Missals</HI> above forty in number; in all which,
upon our once reading, wee presume to say that there is not
one such tenour of <HI>Invocation</HI> at all. This our first Reason, ta∣ken
from so universall a silence of ancient Fathers, in a case of
so necessary a moment, may be (wee thinke) satisfactory in it
selfe to any man of ordinary Reason. Our second Objection

whereof appeareth in this; because of an Extreme Dispa∣rity
<MILESTONE N="30"/> betweene your Romish Terme of <HI>Worshipping by a Con∣jecturall

<P>Wee have furthermore in the title of this Section called

of the <HI>Iewes,</HI> a Religion which was then approved and pro∣fessed
by Christ himselfe: <HI>You Samaritanes</HI> (saith Christ)
<HI>worship you know not what; But wee</HI> (Iewes) <HI>know what wee
worship,</HI> Ioh. 4. 22. where, our Lord, who is <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI>
determineth the Cause it selfe, namely, that if the Case so
stand, in point of Gods worship, <HI>The worshipping of not
knowing what,</HI> is damnable; and onely, <HI>the worshipping of

learning, in all Ages, untill your Romish Tyranny brought

Wherein your worshippers faile most blindly both for mat∣ter,
for maner, and for sense; as may be proved by the Igno∣rance
of your worshippers; both concerning the Objects,

<P>Nor could this objection be made by this Iesuite, without
some tincture of Impudencie, forasmuch as hee, by a seeming
Case of Indifferencie, seeketh to excuse his Romish Sect from <MILESTONE N="30"/>
Idolatry, for feare of <HI>[Danger of not adoring Christ where hee

which might not as truly excuse and warrant that <HI>Heathenish

been most <HI>Formally,</HI> and properly <HI>Idolatrous.</HI></P>
<P>Your <HI>Morall,</HI> and <HI>Conjecturall Certainty</HI> would be compared
in the first place. This the Heathens might pretend by the
Reasons, by you already confessed, to wit, the Prescriptions of
their <HI>Priests,</HI> their <HI>Idols speaking,</HI> and the Example of almost <HI>the
whole</HI> vast <HI>world adoring</HI> them. Secondly, you please your

you thinke to <HI>adore Christ;</HI> and the <HI>Pagans</HI> (which also the
whole world of <HI>Idolaters</HI> professed of themselves, and you your

were perswaded they worshipped a <HI>True God.</HI> Thirdly, you
relye upon an <HI>Habituall Condition,</HI> namely, that although the
thing which you adore, be <HI>Bread,</HI> yet your inward Resolution
is not to give <HI>Divine Honour</HI> unto it, if you knew it were but
<HI>Bread,</HI> and not <HI>Christ.</HI> But inquire you now into your owne
Bibles, and you shall find that the Heathen were not inferiour
unto you in this Modification also; for in the <HI>History of Bell and</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>the Dragon</HI> it is read, that the <HI>King of Babel,</HI> and other <HI>Babylo∣nians</HI>
worshipped <HI>Bel</HI> with Divine honour, thinking it to live,
untill such time as <HI>Daniel</HI> had discovered it to be but an <HI>Idol:</HI>
and no sooner had the King perceived the Delusion, but pre∣sently
he commanded it should be demolished. The Case then is
plaine. Hee, and they, who abhorred, and uterly destroyed
that <HI>Idoll,</HI> assoone as they knew it not to be God, were there∣fore,
before that, <HI>habitually</HI> in their hearts resolved not to ho∣nour
it, if they could have beene perswaded it had not beene a
<HI>God.</HI> In such just Equipage do these your Romish, and those <MILESTONE N="40"/>
Heathenish walke together, that from these your owne Pre∣mises,
you may take your Conclusion out of the mouth of your

touching Ordination.
SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<P>TO passe over matters not controverted betweene us, whe∣ther <MILESTONE N="40"/>
the Minister that consecrateth this Sacrament ought
to be consecrated by Ecclesiasticall Ordination to this Function
(a matter agreed upon on both sides) the onely question is, if
hee that ministreth happen to be an <HI>Intruder,</HI> and no consecra∣ted
Minister, whether this his Defect do so nullifie his <HI>Conse∣cration</HI>
of the Eucharist, that it becometh altogether unpro∣fitable
to the devout Communicant. Your Church in this case
<PB N="555" REF="297"/>
sendeth you to inquire after the Godfathers, Godmothers,
Priest, or Midwife that <HI>baptizeth,</HI> to know whether hee have
beene <HI>rightly baptized;</HI> and this not satisfying, shee will have
you seeke forth the <HI>Bishop,</HI> by whom hee was ordained, and so
to the <HI>Odainer</HI> of that Bishop, and so to speere further, and fur∣ther,
untill you come to Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> to see whether each of
these were rightly consecrated a Priest, and then to search into
so many Church-bookes, to know the Baptisme of each one,
without which the Act of this Priest now consecrating is fru∣strate,
<MILESTONE N="10"/> and your Adoration Idolatrous. Contrariwise wee,
in such an indeprehensible Case, (observe that wee speake of
an extraordinary Case) wherein the Actor or Act hath no
apparent Defect, are no way scrupulous, knowing that things
do worke <HI>Ad modum Recipientis:</HI> as you have heard in the Ex∣ample
of preaching the word of God, were it by <HI>Iudas,</HI> or if
you will a <HI>transformed Devill,</HI> yet the seed being Gods, it may
be fruitfull, (whatsoever the Seed-man be) if the ground that
receiveth it be capable. Therefore here might wee take occa∣sion
to compare the <HI>Ordination</HI> Romish and English; and to

<P>MAny words shall not need for this first point.
<HI>Superstition</HI> is described by the Apostle in

will-worship;</HI> as it is opposite to the worship

<HI>will of Christ</HI> is, concerning the Celebra∣tion
<MILESTONE N="40"/> of the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of his <HI>Body,</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI>
wee have learned by his <HI>last Will</HI> and <HI>Testa∣ment,</HI>
expresly charging his Church, and saying, [Do THIS:]
pointing out thereby such proper <HI>Acts,</HI> which concerned ei∣ther
the <HI>Administring,</HI> or the <HI>Participating</HI> of the same holy Sa∣crament.
But now cometh in <HI>Mans will-worship,</HI> ordained in the
<HI>Church of Rome;</HI> as flatly contradictory to the same Command
of Christ, by <HI>Ten</HI> notorious <HI>Transgressions,</HI> as if it had beene in

<P>And then is <HI>Superstition</HI> most bewitching, when it is disgui∣zed

<P>But that, which excedeth all height of Superstition, is, when

againe, as often as One or Other of the Debters should
make such an acknowledgment, the Surety having once suffici∣ently
satisfied for all. So Christ having once for all satisfied
the justice of God, by the price of his Blood, in the behalfe of
all penitent Sinners, who in Contrition of heart and a living
Faith apprehend the Truth of that his Redemption; it cannot
but be both injurious to the justice of God, and to the merit of
Christ, that the same satisfactory Sacrifice, as it were a new pay∣ment,
ought againe, by way of Satisfaction, be personally per∣formed

SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>IN your Missall, after Consecration, it is prayed thus:<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Missal. Rom.</HI> Offerimus Majestati tuae, Domine, im∣maculatam Hostiam sanctum panem vitae aeternae, &amp; Calicem salutis perpetuae—supra quae propitio vultu respicere digne∣ris, sicut dignatus es munera justi pueri tui Abel. <HI>And in the next place.</HI> Iube haec per∣ferri per manus san∣cti Angeli in sublime Altare tuum coeleste.</NOTE> <HI>Wee

<HI>which vouchsafe to looke with a propitious and favourable Counte∣nance,
as thou didst accept the gifts of thy holy servant Abel, and
command these to be carried up into thy celestiall Altar,</HI> &amp;c.
So the Canon of your Masse. Some Protestants, in their zeale
to the glory of Christ, impute unto you hereupon a Sacrilegi∣ous
Profanenesse, whilest you beleeving <HI>That Host,</HI> and <HI>That
Cup</HI> to be the <HI>very Body, and Blood</HI> of Christ, and a <HI>Propitiatory
Sacrifice</HI> in it selfe, yet do so pray God to be <HI>propitious</HI> unto it,
and to <HI>accept</HI> it, as hee did the <HI>Sacrifice of Abel;</HI> yeelding

<P>At the hearing of this, your Cardinall (See the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 24.</HI> Fa∣cilis est responsio: Non petimus pro Christi reconciliatio∣ne apud Patrem, sed pro nostra infirmi∣tate: etsi enim obla∣tio consecrata ex par∣te rei, quae offertur, &amp; ex parte Christi principalis offerentis semper Deo placebat, tamen ex parte Mi∣nistri &amp; populi astan∣tis, qui simul etiam offerunt, fieri potest ut non place at—<HI>Paulò post.</HI> Compa∣ratio non est inter Sacrificium nostrum, &amp; Sacrificium Abe∣lis, sed tantùm ratio∣ne fidei, &amp; devotionis offerentium, ut nimi∣rùm tantâ fide offe∣rant, quantâ Abel—quod Sacrificium Abelis non haberet in se, quod Deo pla∣cere, eumque placare possit, qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dicitur Heb. 11. per fidem obtulit Abel Deo Sa∣crificium melius—<HI>Ratio.</HI> Gen 4.

1. Prefaceth, 2. Answereth, 3. Illustrateth, 4. Reaso∣neth.
First of his Preface. <HI>The Answer</HI> (saith hee) <HI>is easie.</HI>
As if that Objection, which seemeth to us a huge logg in your
way, were so little an obstacle, that any might skip over it. But
have you never seene men, in trusting too much to their nim∣blenesse,
to over-reach themselves in their leape, stumble,
fall, and breake their limbes?</P>
<P>Semblably hee in his Answer (which is the second point) <HI>The</HI><MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>meaning of our Church</HI> (saith hee) <HI>is not to pray for Christs recon∣ciliation,
who was alwayes well pleasing to God, but in respect of
the infirmity of the Priest and people, that the offering may be ac∣cepted
from them.</HI> So hee. But whatsoever the meaning of the
Priest in his praying is, sure wee are this cannot be the meaning
of the Prayer; for the matter prayed for is set downe to be
<HI>Holy Bread of life,</HI> and <HI>Cup of Salvation,</HI> which you interpret to
be <HI>Substantially</HI> the <HI>Body and Blood of Christ</HI> in the Sacrament;
and the tenour of prayer expressely is, <HI>[Vpon which Lord looke
propitiously;]</HI> wee say, <HI>upon which,</HI> not <HI>upon whom;</HI> which point <MILESTONE N="40"/>
is confirmed in that which followeth.</P>
<P>Thirdly therefore hee illustrateth. <HI>The Comparison</HI> (saith hee)
<HI>is not absolutely betweene the Sacrifice of Abel, and of Christ,
but in respect of the faitb and devotion of the Priest, and people,
that they with like faith may offer, as Abel did.</HI> But this piece
<PB N="561" REF="300"/>
of Answer is that, which is called in Musicke <HI>Discantas contra
punctum;</HI> for the prayer is directly: <HI>[Looke downe propitiously
upon these, as thou didst upon the gifts of Abel.]</HI> The Compari∣son
then is distinctly betweene the <HI>Gifts,</HI> and not betweene the
<HI>Givers.</HI> Yea but <HI>not absolutely so meant</HI> (saith hee:) be it so, yet
if it be <HI>so meant</HI> but in part, that Christ, who is <HI>Propitiation</HI>
it selfe, shall be prayed for to be <HI>propitiously,</HI> and <HI>favourably loo∣ked
upon by God,</HI> the prayer is <HI>Sacrilegious</HI> in an high degree.</P>
<P>Fourthly his Reason. <HI>It is knowne</HI> (saith hee) <HI>that the Sacrifi∣ces
of Sheepe and Oxen had nothing in themselves, whereby to paci∣fie,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>or please God, the Scripture saying, that Abel offered a better
Sacrifice than Cain.</HI> And againe, <HI>God had respect to Abel, and
to his Gifts.</HI> So hee. Which is the very Reason that perswa∣deth
Protestants to call that your Prayer most <HI>Sacrilegious,</HI> be∣cause
whereas the <HI>Gifts of Abel</HI> were but <HI>Sheepe,</HI> &amp;c. you,
notwithstanding, compare them with the offering up of Christ,
saying, <HI>[As thou didst the Gifts of Abel.]</HI> For although it be true,
that the <HI>Gift of Abel</HI> was <HI>accepted</HI> for the Faith of the Giver, and
not the Giver for his Gift; yet if you shall apply this to the
<MILESTONE N="20"/> point in Question, then your <HI>Gift</HI> (in your Opinion) being
<HI>Christ,</HI> and your <HI>Givers</HI> but simply men, (whom you have cal∣led
<HI>Priest,</HI> and <HI>People)</HI> it must follow that Christ is accepted for
the Faith of the Priest, and People; and not the Priest and Peo∣ple
for Christ, which maketh your <HI>Prayer</HI> farre more abomina∣bly
<HI>Sacrilegious.</HI> And not much lesse is that which followeth,
praying God to <HI>command</HI> his Angel <HI>to carry</HI> (if the <HI>Gift</HI> be Hee)
Christ <HI>into heaven;</HI> contrary to the Article of our Catholike
Faith, which teacheth us to believe his perpetuall Residence <HI>in
heaven, at the right hand of the Father.</HI> Hee answereth:<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Bellarm. sup. And so Doctor Hes∣kins (out of Hugo de sancto victore) in his Parliament of Christ, Booke 3. Chap. 395.</NOTE> <HI>It
is not meant, that God would command his Angel to carry Christ's
Body, but our prayers and desires, by the intercession of the Angel</HI>
<MILESTONE N="30"/><HI>unto God for us.</HI> So hee. Which is as truly a false Glosse, as the
former; for, in the Tenour of your Masse, the Subject of your
prayer is <HI>[Holy Bread of life,</HI> and <HI>Cup of salvation.]</HI> The prayer
is plainly thus; <HI>Vpon which, O Lord, looke propitiously:</HI> and im∣mediately
after, <HI>Command [These] to be carried by thy Angel.</HI>
Marke, <HI>[These]</HI> viz. <HI>That Bread of life,</HI> and <HI>Cup of salvation;</HI>
even that, which you call, <HI>The Body, and Blood of Christ,</HI> as

<P>OVr first Argument is against the foundation thereof, which
is your Interpretation of the Article [HOC] by denying
it to have Relation to <HI>Bread;</HI> contrary to the verdict of an In∣quest <MILESTONE N="10"/>
of Ancient Fathers, shewing, that the same pointeth out
<HI>Bread,</HI> as you have<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Booke 2. Cha. 1. Sect. 6.</NOTE> heard: whereby the monstrous Con∣ception
of <HI>Transubstantiation</HI> is strangled in the very wombe.</P>
<P><HI>Insomuch that sometimes they expressely</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>interpret it thus;</HI>
Christs Body, and Blood, <HI>that is, (say they)</HI> The Bread, and Wine.
<HI>Item,</HI> Hee gave the name of the Signe to the thing signified. <HI>Item,</HI>
Bread the Signe of his Body. <HI>And lastly,</HI> Bread is called Christs
Body, because it signifieth his Body.</P>

calling the Eucharist (which you dare not)<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 5. &amp; 11. &amp; Sect. 14. in Chrysost, and by Cyprian his Confutation of the <HI>A∣quarii,</HI> ibid. Sect. 5. &amp; Book 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Bread</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20"/>

Suffrages of Antiquity.</P>
<P>Thirdly against your <HI>Faith,</HI> concerning the maner of <HI>Corpo∣rall
Presence</HI> of Christ in the Eucharist; because so farre were
the Fathers from beleeving that the <HI>Body of Christ</HI> could be in
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Booke 4. tho∣rowout.</NOTE> <HI>divers places</HI> (as you say in Millions) <HI>at one time,</HI> that by

the <HI>Godhead</HI> of Christ from his <HI>Manhood;</HI> and they
have proved the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> to be <HI>God,</HI> and no <HI>Creature</HI> by the <MILESTONE N="40"/>
same Reason. Than which Three Arguments none can be more
Convincent. Whereunto you may adde the Fathers speeches,
contradicting your Dreame of a <HI>Body whole in every part, in

<HI>Christ his Ascension into Heaven</HI> to argue his <HI>Absence

<P><PB N="565" REF="302"/>
Our Fourth Generall Argument is, that whereas your <HI>Cor∣porall
Presence</HI> must needs inferre <HI>Corporall Eating</HI> thereof by
the Communicants, notwithstanding you have heard the con∣trary
Sentences of Ancient Fathers, against<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Booke 5. tho∣rowout.</NOTE> <HI>Tearing,</HI> and

did eat the same.</HI> Then, of the <HI>Remainders</HI> of the <HI>Consecrated
Hosts,</HI> that they were<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Booke. 1. Cha. 2. Sect. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Earen</HI> (by the ordinance of the

by <HI>Faith</HI> that whosoever so toucheth him is <HI>Sanctified.</HI> Which
Observations, concerning our Fourth Generall Argument, do
minister unto us five particular Reasons, which make our De∣fence
to be Impreinable.</P>
<P>Fifthly, forasmuch as you teach the <HI>Subject matter</HI> of the Eu∣charist
<MILESTONE N="20"/> to be the <HI>Body of Christ,</HI> as a proper <HI>Sacrifice propitia∣tory;</HI>
wee, upon due inquisition into the doctrine of Antiquity,
have<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Booke 6. Ch. 3. Sect. 2. thorowout, and elsewhere.</NOTE> found the Ancient Fathers I. Nothing that, which
they called <HI>Sacrifice</HI> herein, to be <HI>Bread,</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> saying there∣upon
that <HI>Melchisedech,</HI> in that his <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> offered the

is, <HI>Divine Adoration</HI> of the Host: yet notwithstanding have
you not beene able, by the Testimonies of any ancient Father,

<P>Wee are furthermore not destiture of matter for a large Con∣futation
(first) of your assuming Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> as the <HI>Author of
your Vulgar Latine Translation;</HI> to manifest that it is no more
the <HI>Translation of Hierome,</HI> or yet of any one Author, than the
divers habits of a mans Body, from head to foot, can be called
the worke of one singular work-man.</P>
<P>Secondly, concerning the Authority thereof, you professe it
to be <HI>Authenticall</HI> (that is, as you have defined) <HI>Conformable to
the Originall Hebrew and Greeke:</HI> although it may be as easily
<MILESTONE N="30"/> proved, not to be that <HI>Ancient Vulgar,</HI> which had continued
(as the Decree speaketh) <HI>from divers ages,</HI> than the <HI>Ship of The∣seus,</HI>
which after some Ages had beene so thorowly battered
and pierced, that at last the keele and bottome therof did onely
remaine, which could be called the <HI>Same.</HI> But passing by all fur∣ther
Dispute, wee shall referre you to the judgement of the Pa∣trones
of the former Rule (so insolently contemned by the
<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<PB N="576" REF="308"/>
<HI>Spanish Inquisitors,</HI> as you have heard) by one Instance, which
may be sufficient in it selfe for triall of the Case now in hand.</P>
<P>The Text of Scripture is <HI>Ephes. 1. 14.</HI> in the Latine Transla∣tion
(even in that, which is set forth by Pope<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Clem. Octa∣vus—In perpetuam rei memoriam—Textus accuratissime mendis purgatus.</NOTE> <HI>Clement,</HI> as
<HI>The most accurate Edition)</HI> thus:<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ephes. 1. 14. <HI>Lat.

Sed si Deus charitatem dat, tanquam pignus per spiritum suum, cum eam rem ipsam reddiderit, quâ promissa pignus dedit, auferendum est à nobis Pignus? Absit!

of promise, which is the Pledge of your inheritance.</HI> But in the
Greeke it is: <HI>You are sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the
Earnest of your inheritance.</HI> The Question is, whether of these
is to be preferred; and <HI>Hierome,</HI> and <HI>Augustine</HI> are ready to re∣solve <MILESTONE N="10"/>
you herein, both of them Correcting the Vulgar Transla∣tion
in the word <HI>Pledge,</HI> and one of them giving an <HI>Absit!</HI> against
this Sense of it. The Reason of both is, because hee that giveth
a <HI>Pledge</HI> taketh it againe, when the Thing, for which it was
pledged, is received. But hee that giveth an <HI>Earnest,</HI> will
have it continue with him, to whom it was given. And so God
assuring his Chosen, by his Spirit, doth for their greater Confi∣dence
give it as an <HI>Earnest,</HI> and not as a <HI>Pledge.</HI> So they. Ther∣by
advancing Gods gracious love, towards man, and mans faith
in Gods love. Here will be no corner of Pretence, that this be∣ing
an Errour of <HI>Print,</HI> and not of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> may be rejected <MILESTONE N="20"/>
by you without Prejudice to your Oath; no, for Errour of
Print ariseth from some affinity of words, (as where these
words, <HI>This is a sound Reason,</HI> being delivered to the Print,
was returned from the Presse thus; <HI>This is a fond Reason.)</HI>
But betweene <HI>Pignus,</HI> and <HI>Arrhabo,</HI> there is no more Sympho∣nie
than betweene an Horse, and a Saddle. Nor will it avayle
you to say that the Originall Greeke was corrupted, for it is
the same Greeke word, which <HI>Hierome</HI> himselfe (who as you
know used the perfectest Greeke Text) doth here avow to <MILESTONE N="30"/>
be True.</P>
<Q>II. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers is in swearing to the
Romish Expositions of Scripture.</Q>
<P>THe Tenour of the Oath, in this respect, is:<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bulla eadem.</HI> Sacram Scripturam admitto juxta eum sensum, quem Te∣nuit, &amp; Tenet Ma∣ter Ecclesia—ex∣tra quam nemo sal∣vus, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>I admit the</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>

hath held, and doth hold.</HI> By <HI>[Mother Church]</HI> understanding
the <HI>Church of Rome, as without which there is no salvation;</HI> which
is expressed in the same Oath, as another Article therein, and
which else-where wee have proved to be a GRAND IMPO∣STVRE,
in a full Tractate, from the Doctrine of the <HI>Apostles,</HI>
of <HI>Generall Councels,</HI> of severall <HI>Catholike Churches,</HI> and from
such <HI>Primitive Fathers,</HI> whose memories are at this day regi∣stred
<PB N="577" REF="308"/>
in the Romish <HI>Calender of Saints.</HI> How then can the Oath
for this point be taken without danger of Perjury? But to come
to the Article, concerning the Expositions of Scriptures <HI>Accor∣ding
to the sense of the Church of Rome,</HI> which would thereby be
thought to <HI>Hold</HI> no Sense of Scripture now, which shee had
not <HI>Held</HI> in more Ancient Times. Wee, for Triall hereof,
shall for this present seeke after no other Instances, than such
as in this Treatise have beene discussed, and for brevity-sake
single, out of many, but onely Three; A first is in that Scrip∣ture,
<MILESTONE N="10"/><HI>Ioh. 6. Except you eate the flesh of the Son of man, you can∣not

<P>The word <HI>[Except]</HI> was extended unto <HI>Infants</HI> in the dayes

<HI>six hundred yeares together,</HI> when the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> there∣upon
<HI>Held it necessary for Infants to receive the Eucharist.</HI> Con∣trarily
the now Romane Church <HI>Holdeth it Inexpedient to ad∣minister
the Eucharist unto Infants,</HI> as you have heard.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Luk. 22. Take, Eate, &amp;c.</HI> Your Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in

Christ sensually with mens teeth,</HI> in a Literall sense. Which your
now Romane Church (if wee may believe your Iesuites) doth
not <HI>Hold,</HI> as hath appeared.</P>
<P>Thirdly the Tenour of the Institution of Christ, concerning
the Cup, was <HI>Held</HI> in the dayes of Pope<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Booke 1. Ch. 3. Sect. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Gelasius</HI> to be pe∣remptory,
for the administration thereof, to prove that the <HI>Eu∣charist</HI>
ought to be administred <HI>in both kindes</HI> to all Communi∣cants,
and judging the dismembring of them a <HI>Grand Sacrilege,</HI>
as you have heard: whereas now your Romish Church <HI>Holdeth</HI>
<MILESTONE N="30"/> it not onely lawfull, but also religious to with-hold the <HI>Cup</HI>
from all, but onely Consecrating Priests. Vpon these (omitting
other Scriptures, which you your selves may observe at your
best leasure) wee conclude. You therefore in taking that <HI>Oath,</HI>
swearing to admit all Interpretations of <HI>Scripture,</HI> both which
the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> once <HI>Held,</HI> and now <HI>Holdeth;</HI> the Pro∣verbe
must needs be verified upon you, viz. <HI>You hold a Woolfe
by the eare:</HI> which howsoever you <HI>Hold,</HI> you are sure to be
Oath-bit, either in <HI>Holding</HI> TENVIT, by TENET, or in <HI>Holding</HI>
TENET, by TENVIT.</P>
<Q><MILESTONE N="40"/> III. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers, is in swearing to
the pretended Consent of Fathers, in their
Expositions of Scriptures.</Q>
<P>HEare your Oath.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bulla ead.</HI> Nec Scripturam ullam, ni∣si juxtà unanimem Consensum Patrum interpretabor.</NOTE> <HI>Neither will I ever interpret any Scrip∣ture,

assembled in a Councel, where the major part of voices conclude

with this Diminution, <HI>For the most part;</HI> and hereupon make
bold to averre, that your Iuror by this Oath is sworne to a flat <MILESTONE N="10"/>
Falsity, because you cannot deny but that the Fathers, in their
Expositions, dissent among themselves, insomuch that you
your selves are at difference, among your selves, which part to
side with;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Valent. Ies. Anal. lib. 8. cap. 8.</HI> Pa∣tet nobis via urgendi unum aut alterum Doctorem authorita∣te reliquorum.</NOTE> <HI>With the greater</HI> (saith <HI>Valentia,)</HI> nay but some∣time

<HI>the Authority of the Pope is to take place, who being guided
by other rules may propound what is the Sense.</HI> Behold here the <MILESTONE N="20"/>
very ground of that, which wee call <HI>Popery,</HI> which is devising and
obtruding upon the Church of Christ <HI>new Articles of Faith</HI> un∣knowne
(for ought you know) to Ancient Fathers. And is it
possible to find an <HI>Vnanimity of Consent</HI> in an Individuall Vnity,
or rather a Nullity? for what else is an Ignorance, what the
Sense of the Fathers is, whether so, or so?</P>
<P>Next, that it may appeare that this <HI>Article,</HI> touching the <HI>V∣nanimous
Consent of Fathers,</HI> is a meere Ostentation and gullery,
and no better than that Challenge made by the wise man of <MILESTONE N="30"/>
<HI>Athens</HI> of all the Ships, that entred into the Road, to be his
owne: as if you should say, All the Fathers do patronize your
Romish Cause. Wee shall give you one or two Examples,
among your Iesuites, as patternes of the Disposition of o∣thers
in neglecting, sleighting, and rejecting the more Generall
Consent of Fathers in their <HI>Expositions of Scriptures.</HI> One In∣stance
may be given in your Cardinall, who, in his <HI>Commenta∣ries
upon the Psalmes,</HI> dedicated to the then Pope, professeth
himselfe to have composed them,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Bellar. Epist. Dedic.

than by reading of many Bookes;</HI> whereas hee that will <MILESTONE N="40"/>
seeke for <HI>Vnanimous Consent of Fathers,</HI> must have a perusall of
them all. In the second place hearken unto the Accents of your
Iesuite <HI>Maldonate,</HI> in his rejecting the <HI>Expositions</HI> of the <HI>Fa∣thers,</HI>
as for Example:<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><HI>Maldon. Ies. in Matth. 20.</HI> Existi∣mant Patres filios Zebedaei temerè re∣spondisse: ego vero credo eos verè esse locutos. <HI>Item in Mat. 16. 18.</HI> [Non prae∣valebunt.] Quorum verborum sensus non videtur mihi esse, quē omnes, praeter Hila∣rium, quos legisse memini, Authores putant. <HI>Itē in Mat. 11. 11.</HI> Variae sunt Patrū opiniones, sed (ut li∣berè fatear) in nulla earum aquiesco. <HI>Item in Matth. 11. 13.</HI> [Pro∣phetae &amp; lex.] Omnes fere veteres ita exponunt, sed non est apta satis interpretatio. <HI>Item in Mat. 19. 11.</HI> Non om∣nes capiunt, i e non omnes capimus: Sic omnes fere veteres exponunt, quibus equidem non assentior. <HI>Item in Ioh. 6. 62.</HI> Sic quidem expono, &amp; licet Expositionis hujus Autorem nullum habeo, hanc tamen magis probo, quā illam Augustini, caeterorum{que} alioqui probabilissimam, quia hoc cum CALVINISTARUM sensu magis pugnat.</NOTE> <HI>So indeed said the Fathers, but I be∣lieve
<PB N="579" REF="309"/>
the Contrary.</HI> Item, <HI>This seemeth not to me to be the Sense of

Item, <HI>Their Opinions are divers, I rest upon of them all.</HI> I∣tem,
<HI>All Ancients almost do so expound this Text, but this is no fit
Interpretation.</HI> Item, <HI>Thus I expound this Scripture, and albeit I
have no Author of this Exposition, yet I do approve it rather than
that of Augustine, or of Others, although otherwise most probable,
even because it is repugnant to the Sense and Exposition of the</HI> CAL∣VINISTS.

<P><HI>Salmeron</HI> the Iesuite may stand for the Third upon that Text,
Rom. 5. <HI>In whom all have sinned,</HI> which teacheth the universall
Guilt of <HI>Originall Sin</HI> of mankinde. What the Sense of the
Fathers was from this Text, your <HI>Canus</HI> will certifie you;<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>Canus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Theol lib. 7. cap. 3.</HI> Sanct omnes qui in ejus rei mentionem incidôre, uno ore asseruerunt B.

<Q>IV. Overture of Perjury, in the Defenders of the Romish

<P>IN the last Clause of the Oath, prescribed in the Bull of Pope

to Infants was not held necessary;</HI> which your owne Authors
have<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 11.</NOTE> confessed, and proved to be false. Secondly, that the
presence of them, who, at the administration of the Eucharist,
do not communicate, is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ibid. Sect. 5. &amp; Sect. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Commendable,</HI> and held a Doctrine <HI>Ca∣tholike</HI>

be run away with <HI>Mice,</HI> and <HI>be blowne away with the wind,</HI> hee is
<HI>damned;</HI> and a number other like extreme foolish Crotchets,
set downe in your <HI>Missals,</HI> which wee willingly omit. The
Summe of all these is, that the same your <HI>Oath,</HI> made to <HI>damne</HI>

others, doth serve chiefly to make the <HI>Swearers</HI> themselves most
<HI>damnable.</HI> If peradventure any of you shall oppose, saying that
none of you within this Kingdome (which never admitted of the
<HI>Councel of Trent,</HI> nor of the <HI>Bull</HI> of Pope <HI>Pius the fourth)</HI> are yet
bound to that <HI>Oath,</HI> let him know that although this may excuse
him from an <HI>Actuall Perjury,</HI> yet can it not free him from the
<HI>Habituall,</HI> which is, that hee is disposed in himselfe to take it,
whensoever it shall be offered unto him in any Kingdome, that
doth imbrace and professe the same.</P>

the more studious ought you to shew your selves in exami∣ning
<MILESTONE N="20"/> the proofes thereof; that so you may either confute, or
confesse them, and accordingly re-assume, or renounce your
Romish Defence.</P>
<P><HI>Heresie</HI> hath a double aspect: One is when it is direct, having
the expresse termes of <HI>Heresie;</HI> the Other is oblique, and by
consequence, when the Defence doth inferre or imply necessa∣rily
the same Hereticall Sense, even as it may be said of Trea∣son.
For to say that <HI>Caesar is not King,</HI> is a Treasonable speech
<HI>Directly,</HI> in a plaine Sense; and to say that <HI>Tribute money is not

being premised, wee are now to recognize such Errours, wher∣in

of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> judging it to be<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Booke 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Greatly Sacrilegious:</HI>

<P>4. Sometime there may be a Reason to do a thing, when as
yet there is no right, nor Authority for him that doth it. Wee
therefore exact of you an Authority for altering the Apostles
Customes, and Constitutions; and are answered that<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Booke 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 4.</NOTE> <HI>your
Church hath Authority over the Apostles Precepts.</HI> Iump <MILESTONE N="10"/>

<P>BOOKE II. It is not nothing, which hath beene observed
therein (to wit) your Reasoning, why you ought not to in∣terpret
the words of Christ <HI>[This is my Body]</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Booke 2. Cha. 3. thorowout.</NOTE> literally;
and why you urge his other Saying <HI>[Except you eate my flesh]</HI>
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> for proofe of <HI>Bodily Eating;</HI> so that your Priest may
literally say in your Masse, that <HI>The Body of Christ passeth
into your Bellies and Entrails,</HI> because (forsooth) the words <MILESTONE N="20"/>
of Christ are<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Booke 2. Cha. 3. Sect. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Doctrinall.</HI> And have you not heard of
one <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> who hearing Christ teach that every man
must be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Borne againe,</HI> who shall be partaker of Gods
Kingdome; and that hee, expounding them in a Literall
Sense, conceited a <HI>new Entrance</HI> into his <HI>Mothers</HI> wombe,
when as nothing wanted to turne that his Errour into an
<HI>Heresie,</HI> but onely <HI>Obstinacie?</HI> But of the strong and strange

<P>BOOKE III. After followeth your Article of <HI>Transubstan∣tiation.</HI>
I. Your direct profession is indeed to believe no
<HI>Body</HI> of Christ, but that which was <HI>Borne of the Virgin Ma∣ry.</HI>
But this your Article of <HI>Transubstantiation of Bread</HI> into
<HI>Christ's Body,</HI> generally held, according to the proper nature
of <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> to be by<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Production</HI> of Christs Body
out of the <HI>Substance of Bread,</HI> it necessarily inferreth a Body
(called, and believed to be Christs) which is <HI>not Borne of the
Blessed Virgin,</HI> as Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> hath plainly<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Booke. 4. Ch. 4. Sect. 1.</NOTE> taught; diver∣sifying
the Bodily thing on the <HI>Altar</HI> from the Body of Christ <MILESTONE N="40"/>
borne of the <HI>Virgin.</HI> Therefore your Defence symbolizeth
with the Heresie of <HI>Apollinaris,</HI> who taught a<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 2</NOTE> <HI>Body not Borne

<P>Secondly, You exclude all judgement of<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Senses,</HI> in

in Confutation of the same Errour in the <HI>Mar∣cionites.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, for Defence of Christ his <HI>invisible Bodily Presence,</HI>
you professe that (after Consecration) <HI>Bread</HI> is no more the
same, but changed into the <HI>Body of Christ:</HI> which Doctrine in
very expresse words was bolted out by an <HI>Eutychian Heretike,</HI>
and instantly coudemned by<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Booke 3. Cha. 3. Sect. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Theodoret,</HI> and as fully abando∣ned

<P>BOOKE IV. Catholike Fathers were in nothing more zea∣lous,
than in defending the distinct properties of the <HI>two na∣tures</HI>
of Christ his <HI>Deity,</HI> and <HI>Humanity,</HI> against the pernicious
Heresies of the <HI>Manichees, Marcionites, Eutychians,</HI> and <HI>Euno∣mians;</HI>
all of them diversly oppugning the Integrity of <HI>Christ's
Body,</HI> sometime in direct termes, and sometime by irrefragra∣ble
Consequences; whether it were by gaine-saying the <HI>Fi∣nitenesse,</HI>
or <HI>Solidity,</HI> or else the compleat <HI>Perfection</HI> there∣of:
wherein how farre yee may challenge affinity or kin∣dred
<MILESTONE N="20"/> with them, be you pleased to examine by this which
followeth.</P>
<P>I. The <HI>Heretikes,</HI> who undermined the property of <HI>Christ's
Bodily Finitenesse,</HI> said that it was <HI>in divers places at once,</HI> (as
is<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Book 4. Chap. 4. Sect. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. &amp; Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Sect. 3. &amp; Chap. 6. Sect. 1.</NOTE> confessed) even as your Church doth now attribute unto
the same Body of Christ, both in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and in <HI>Earth,</HI> yea,
and in <HI>Millions of distant Altars at the same time;</HI> and conse∣quently
in all places whatsoever. Now whether this Doctrine
of Christ's <HI>Bodily Presence</HI> in many places at once was held of
the Catholike Fathers for <HI>Hereticall,</HI> it may best be seene by
<MILESTONE N="30"/> their Doctrine of the <HI>Existence of Christ's Body in one onely place;</HI>
not onely <HI>Definitively,</HI> but also <HI>Circumscriptively:</HI> both which
do teach an absolute Impossibility of the Existence of the same
in <HI>divers places at once.</HI> And they were as zealous in professing
the Article of the <HI>maner of Christs Bodily Being in place,</HI> as they
are in instructing men of the Article of Christ's <HI>Bodily Being,</HI>
lest that the deniall of its Bodily maner of being might de∣stroy
the <HI>nature</HI> of his Body. {fleur-de-lys} So farre, that the Ancient
Father <HI>Vigilius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vigilius. B. 4. C. 5. §. 5.</NOTE> testifieth, that to believe <HI>The Body of
Christ, wheresoever it was, to be Circumscribed in one place,</HI>
<MILESTONE N="40"/><HI>was the Ancient Catholike Doctrine of those Ages.</HI> {fleur-de-lys} To
which end they have concluded it to be absolutely but in <HI>one
place,</HI> sometime in a<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Chap. 4 tho∣rowout.</NOTE> <HI>Circumscriptive Finitenesse,</HI> thereby di∣stinguishing
them from all created Spirits; and sometime by a
<HI>Definitive Termination,</HI> which they set downe first by Exem∣plications,
thus:<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ibid. Sect. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>If Christ his Body be on Earth, then it is ab∣sent
from Heaven;</HI> and thus, <HI>Being in the Sunne, it could not be
in the Moone:</HI> Secondly, by divers Comparisons, for compa∣ring
<PB N="584" REF="312"/>
the <HI>Creature</HI> with the <HI>Creator</HI> God, they<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> conclude, that
<HI>The Creature is not God, because it is determinated in one place;</HI> and
comparing the humane, and divine Nature of Christ together,
they<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Cha. 4. Sect. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> conclude, that they are herein different, because the hu∣mane
and Bodily Nature of Christ is necessarily <HI>included in one
place:</HI> and lastly comparing <HI>Creatures</HI> with the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> they
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Cha. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Sect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> conclude a difference by the same Argument, because the
<HI>Holy Ghost is in many places at once;</HI> and all these in confutation
of divers <HI>Heretikes.</HI> A thing so well knowne to your elder Ro∣mish
Schoole, that it confessed the Doctrine of <HI>Existence of a</HI><MILESTONE N="10"/>
<HI>Body in divers places at once</HI> (in the judgement of Antiquity) to
be<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Hereticall.</HI> {fleur-de-lys} Yea and so Hereticall, that it openeth a
Sluce for the old raucid Heresie of the <HI>Ariomanitae,</HI> (by inter∣pretation,
<HI>Maddish-Arians)</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low in upon us, who denied
the Holy Ghost to be God, as not being every where;
whom the Primitive Fathers did Confute, (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See B. 4. C. 7. §. 2.</NOTE> Seven in num∣ber)
by proving the Holy Ghost to be every where, and

<P>II. The property of a <HI>Solidity</HI> likewise was patronized by
Ancient Fathers, in confutation of <HI>Heretikes,</HI> by teaching
<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Chap. 7. Sect. 6.</NOTE> Christs Body to be necessarily Palpable, against their Im∣palpabilitie;
and to have a Thicknesse, against their feigned

<P>III The property of <HI>Perfection</HI> of the Body of Christ,
wheresoever, in the highest Degree of <HI>Absolutenesse.</HI> This
(one would thinke) every Christian heart should assent unto, at
the first hearing; wherefore if that they were judged <HI>Here∣tickes</HI>
by Ancient Fathers, who<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Prateol. E∣lench. haeres. Tit.</HI> Phi∣loponus Alexandri∣nus. Statuit mortuo∣rum resurrectionem esse, viz. rationalium animarum cum cor∣ruptibili corpore in∣dissolubilem unio∣nem.</NOTE> taught an <HI>Indivisible Vni∣on
of mens soules with their Bodies naturally, still subject to cor∣ruption
after the resurrection;</HI> who can imagine that the holy
Catholicke Fathers would otherwise have judged of this your
generall <HI>Tenet,</HI> (viz. to beleeve a Body of Christ, now since his
Glorification, which is destitute of all power of <HI>naturall moti∣on,</HI><MILESTONE N="40"/>
<HI>sense, appetite, or understanding)</HI> otherwise than of a sense∣lesse,
and Antichristian Deliration, and Delusion? {fleur-de-lys} Fie, no!
for they believed no Body of Christ, after his Resurre∣ction,
but such as is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Booke 4. Cha. 9. §. 3.</NOTE> <HI>void of all infirmity, and in all integrity
most perfect.</HI> {fleur-de-lys} Yea and that which is your onely Reason
<PB N="585" REF="312"/>
you allege, to avoid our Objection of Impossibilities in such
cases, (to wit)<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Booke 4. Ch. 5. Sect. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>The Omnipotencie of God,</HI> the same was
the Pretence of <HI>Heretikes</HI> of old, in the like Assertions;
which occasioned the Ancient Fathers to terme the Pretence
of <HI>Omnipotencie,</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. 2.</NOTE> <HI>The Sanctuary of Heretikes:</HI> albeit the
same <HI>Heretikes,</HI> (as well as you) <HI>intended</HI> (as a Father spea∣keth)
<HI>to magnifie God thereby;</HI> namely, inbeleeving the Body
of Christ, after his Ascension, to be wholly Spirituall. To
which <HI>Heretikes</HI> the same Father readily answered, (as wee
<MILESTONE N="10"/> may to you) saying,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Chap. 4. Sect. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. at <HI>(b</HI> &amp; <HI>c.)</HI></NOTE> <HI>When you will so magnifie Christ, you
do but accuse him of falshood:</HI> not that wee do any whit de∣tract
from the <HI>Omnipotencie of Christ,</HI> (farre be this Spirit of
Blasphemy from us!) but that (as you have beene instructed
by Ancient Fathers) the attributing an <HI>Impossibility</HI> to God, in
such Cases of <HI>Contradiction,</HI> is not a diminishing, but an ample
advancing of the<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Omnipotencie of God.</HI></P>

<P>BOOKE VI. This is spent wholly in examining the Ro∣mish

the sight of so many and so prodigious <HI>Abominations</HI> in your
