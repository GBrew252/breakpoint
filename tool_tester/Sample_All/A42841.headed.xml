<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>COnvuls'd with Grief, whilst Nature's Organs strain,</L>
<L>At last I'm forc'd to breath a Vein;</L>
<L>Or break it must with what it can't containâ–ª</L>
<L>A Vein Elegiack, I mean,</L>
<L>A Flood of Tributary Verse,</L>
<L>Sacred, and fitted to Rehearse</L>
<L><HI>Britannia</HI>'s Fate,</L>
<L>And from its Date</L>
<L>The like Convulsions in the Church and State.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Albion!</HI> Unhappy Isle! what thou hast lost</L>
<L>Defies the Richest Ages to repair;</L>
<L>A <HI>Queen</HI> that Buoy'd thy sinking Honour up,</L>
<L>Who whilst She held the Regal Chair,</L>
<L>Suckl'd thy Hectick Church and State,</L>
<L>Both Languid grown and Ripe for Fate:</L>
<L>She! Great by Nature, Birth, and Education,</L>
<L>O'er look'd the Envy of thy Pievish Nation;</L>
<L>Yet Lov'd thee so,</L>
<L>And Pity'd too,</L>
<L>As to disturb her solid Ease,</L>
<L>With Anxious Cares about thy Peace</L>
<L>Her Gen'rous Soul was always bent</L>
<L>About the Peaceful Arts of Government;</L>
<L>And when th' unhappy Exigence</L>
<L>Of War Recall'd her Royal Consort hence;</L>
<L>Above the Reason of her Sex,</L>
<L>She Taught the Board a Scheme of Politicks,</L>
<L>When to Resolve, How to Debate;</L>
<L>And where to bound Reason of State:</L>
<L>The want of which, and which alone,</L>
<L>Has Widowed many a Realm,</L>
<L>And Emptied many a Throne.</L>

<L>Whilst this Incomparable Lady stood,</L>
<L>Blest with a Natural Delight in Good;</L>
<L>She could not pass Religion by,</L>
<L>But Understood, and Kend that too,</L>
<L>And Lov'd, and Practis'd what she knew:</L>
<L>Those that have her Devotion seen,</L>
<L>Thought her an Abbess, not a Queen:</L>
<L>And as she could to Heaven Bow,</L>
<L>She could be humble to her Subjects too,</L>
<L>Great and not Proud, Affable and not Base,</L>
<L>All o'er Decorum, All o'er Grace;</L>
<L>Never were Virtues so well fix'd,</L>
<L>Never Passions so well mix'd,</L>
<L>Never Nature so alloy'd,</L>
<L>So well temper'd, so employ'd,</L>
<L>That 'twill be difficult to find</L>
<L>Amongst th' Inferiour Sex behind,</L>
<L>So Great a Soul, and so Sedate a Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>If these Conspicuous Virtues could Revoke,</L>
<L>And Pray'rs could Intercept a high Decree,</L>
<L>Or stop the Sin-born Monster's stroke;</L>
<L>Those Balmy Orisons which went,</L>
<L>Dear Saint! in Hecatombs to Heaven for thee,</L>
<L>From Pious Prelates most familiar there,</L>
<L>Must needs have chang'd Divine Assent,</L>
<L>And kept thee here</L>
<L>To Crown us many a happy Year.</L>
<L>But all the Incense, all the Suppliant Oils,</L>
<L>From City Altars, and from Rural Piles,</L>
<L>From Prelates Censers too the Vows which we</L>
<L>Put up when <HI>Albion</HI> was one Censory;</L>
<L>Although they were our All,</L>
<L>Were too too small</L>
<L>A Bidding for the fix'd Decree.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>But now the Fatal Signal's giv'n,</L>
<L>The complicated Evil's join'd;</L>
<L>She took the best Viaticum for Heaven,</L>
<L>And then lay down,</L>
<L>Her Life resign'd,</L>
<L>With that Serenity of Mind</L>
<L>With which she took the Crown:</L>
<L>Stript into naked Spirit, up she Climb</L>
<L>From all this muddy Continent of Time,</L>
<L>By Angels Guarded from new Fears,</L>
<L>Wrapt in a Cloud of Balmy Dew,</L>
<L>Leaving her Kingdoms drown'd in Tears,</L>
<L>Away to Heaven She flew.</L>
